centuries, under, catherine, de, medici, s, influence, as, queen, it, spread, to, france, where, it, developed, even, further, the, dancers, in, these, early, court, ballets, were, mostly, noble, amateurs, ornamented, costumes, were, meant, to, impress, viewers, but, they, restricted, performers, freedom, of, movement, the, ballets, were, performed, in, large, chambers, with, viewers, on, three, sides, the, implementation, of, the, proscenium, arch, from, 1618, on, distanced, performers, from, audience, members, who, could, then, better, view, and, appreciate, the, technical, feats, of, the, professional, dancers, in, the, productions, french, court, ballet, reached, its, height, under, the, reign, of, king, louis, xiv, louis, founded, the, acad, mie, royale, de, danse, royal,

opera, from, which, the, first, professional, ballet, company, the, paris, opera, ballet, arose, pierre, beauchamp, served, as, lully, s, ballet, master, together, their, partnership, would, drastically, influence, the, development, of, ballet, as, evidenced, by, the, credit, given, to, them, for, the, creation, of, the, five, major, positions, of, the, feet, by, 1681, the, first, ballerinas, took, the, stage, following, years, of, training, at, the, acad, mie, ballet, started, to, decline, in, france, after, 1830, but, it, continued, to, develop, in, denmark, italy, and, russia, the, arrival, in, europe, of, the, ballets, russes, led, by, sergei, diaghilev, on, the, eve, of, the, first, world, war, revived, interest, in, the, ballet, and, started, the, modern, era, in, the, twentieth, century, ballet, had, a, wide, influence, on, other, dance, genres, also, in, the, twentieth, century, ballet, took, a, turn, dividing, it, from, classical, ballet, to, the, introduction, of, modern, dance, leading, to, modernist, movements, in, several, countries, famous, dancers, of, the, twentieth, century, include, anna, pavlova, galina, ulanova, rudolf, nureyev, maya, plisetskaya, margot, fonteyn, rosella, hightower, maria, tall, chief, erik, bruhn, mikhail, baryshnikov, suzanne, farrell, gelsey, kirkland, natalia, makarova, arthur, mitchell, and, jeanne, devereaux, stylistic, variations, and, subgenres, have, evolved, over, time, early, classical, variations, are, primarily, associated, with, geographic, origin, examples, of, this, are, russian, ballet, french, ballet, and, italian, ballet, later, variations, such, as, contemporary, ballet, and, neoclassical, ballet, incorporate, both, classical, ballet, and, non, traditional, technique, and, movement, perhaps, the, most, widely, known, and, performed, ballet, style, is, late, romantic, ballet, or, ballet, blanc, classical, ballet, is, based, on, traditional, ballet, technique, and, vocabulary, different, styles, have, emerged, in, different, countries, such, as, french, ballet, italian, ballet, english, ballet, and, russian, ballet, several, of, the, classical, ballet, styles, are, associated, with, specific, training, methods, typically, named, after, their, creators, see, below, the, royal, academy, of, dance, method, is, a, ballet, technique, and, training, system, that, was, founded, by, a, diverse, group, of, ballet, dancers, they, merged, their, respective, dance, methods, italian, french, danish, and, russian, to, create, a, new, style, of, ballet, that, is, unique, to, the, organization, and, is, recognized, internationally, as, the, english, style, of, ballet, some, examples, of, classical, ballet, productions, are, swan, lake, the, sleeping, beauty, and, the, nutcracker, romantic, ballet, was, an, artistic, movement, of, classical, ballet, and, several, productions, remain, in, the, classical, repertoire, today, the, romantic, era, was, marked, by, the, emergence, of, pointe, work, the, dominance, of, female, dancers, and, longer, flowy, tutus, that, attempt, to, exemplify, softness, and, a, delicate, aura, this, movement, occurred, during, the, early, to, mid, nineteenth, century, the, romantic, era, and, featured, themes, that, emphasized, intense, emotion, as, a, source, of, aesthetic, experience, the, plots, of, many, romantic, ballets, revolved, around, spirit, women, sylphs, wilis, and, ghosts, who, enslaved, the, hearts, and, senses, of, mortal, men, the, 1827, ballet, la, sylphide, is, widely, considered, to, be, the, first, and, the, 1870, ballet, copp, lia, is, considered, to, be, the, last, famous, ballet, dancers, of, the, romantic, era, include, marie, taglioni, fanny, elssler, and, jules, perrot, jules, perrot, is, also, known, for, his, choreography, especially, that, of, giselle, often, considered, to, be, the, most, widely, celebrated, romantic, ballet, neoclassical, ballet, is, usually, abstract, with, no, clear, plot, costumes, or, scenery, music, choice, can, be, diverse, and, will, often, include, music, that, is, also, neoclassical, e, g, stravinsky, roussel, tim, scholl, author, of, from, petipa, to, balanchine, considers, george, balanchine, s, apollo, in, 1928, to, be, the, first, neoclassical, ballet, apollo, represented, a, return, to, form, in, response, to, sergei, diaghilev, s, abstract, ballets, balanchine, worked, with, modern, dance, choreographer, martha, graham, and, brought, modern, dancers, into, his, company, such, as, paul, taylor, who, in, 1959, performed, in, balanchine, s, episodes, while, balanchine, is, widely, considered, the, face, of, neoclassical, ballet, there, were, others, who, made, significant, contributions, frederick, ashton, s, symphonic, variations, 1946, is, a, seminal, work, for, the, choreographer, set, to, c, sar, franck, s, score, of, the, same, title, it, is, a, pure, dance, interpretation, of, the, score, another, form, modern, ballet, also, emerged, as, an, offshoot, of, neoclassicism, among, the, innovators, in, this, form, were, glen, tetley, robert, joffrey, and, gerald, arpino, while, difficult, to, parse, modern, ballet, from, neoclassicism, the, work, of, these, choreographers, favored, a, greater, athleticism, that, departed, from, the, delicacy, of, ballet, the, physicality, was, more, daring, with, mood, subject, matter, and, music, more, intense, an, example, of, this, would, be, joffrey, s, astarte, 1967, which, featured, a, rock, score, and, sexual, overtones, in, the, choreography, this, ballet, style, is, often, performed, barefoot, contemporary, ballets, may, include, mime, and, acting, and, are, usually, set, to, music, typically, orchestral, but, occasionally, vocal, it, can, be, difficult, to, differentiate, this, form, from, neoclassical, or, modern, ballet, contemporary, ballet, is, also, close, to, contemporary, dance, because, many, contemporary, ballet, concepts, come, from, the, ideas, and, innovations, of, twentieth, century, modern, dance, including, floor, work, and, turn, in, of, the, legs, the, main, distinction, is, that, ballet, technique, is, essential, to, perform, a, contemporary, ballet, george, balanchine, is, considered, to, have, been, a, pioneer, of, contemporary, ballet, another, early, contemporary, ballet, choreographer, twyla, tharp, choreographed, push, comes, to, shove, for, the, american, ballet, theatre, in, 1976, and, in, 1986, created, in, the, upper, room, for, her, own, company, both, of, these, pieces, were, considered, innovative, for, their, melding, of, distinctly, modern, movements, with, the, use, of, pointe, shoes, and, classically, trained, dancers, today, there, are, many, contemporary, ballet, companies, and, choreographers, these, include, alonzo, king, and, his, company, lines, ballet, matthew, bourne, and, his, company, new, adventures, complexions, contemporary, ballet, nacho, duato, and, his, compa, ia, nacional, de, danza, william, forsythe, and, the, forsythe, company, and, ji, kyli, n, of, the, nederlands, dans, theater, traditionally, classical, companies, such, as, the, mariinsky, kirov, ballet, and, the, paris, opera, ballet, also, regularly, perform, contemporary, works, the, term, ballet, has, evolved, to, include, all, forms, associated, with, it, someone, training, as, a, ballet, dancer, will, now, be, expected, to, perform, neoclassical, modern, and, contemporary, work, a, ballet, dancer, is, expected, to, be, able, to, be, stately, and, regal, for, classical, work, free, and, lyrical, in, neoclassical, work, and, unassuming, harsh, or, pedestrian, for, modern, and, contemporary, work, in, addition, there, are, several, modern, varieties, of, dance, that, fuse, classical, ballet, technique, with, contemporary, dance, such, as, hiplet, that, require, dancers, to, be, practised, in, non, western, dance, styles, there, are, six, widely, used, internationally, recognized, methods, to, teach, or, study, ballet, these, methods, are, the, french, school, the, vaganova, method, the, cecchetti, method, the, bournonville, method, the, royal, academy, of, dance, method, english, style, and, the, balanchine, method, american, style, many, more, schools, of, technique, exist, in, various, countries, although, preschool, age, children, are, a, lucrative, source, of, income, for, a, ballet, studio, ballet, instruction, is, generally, not, appropriate, for, young, children, initial, instruction, requires, standing, still, and, concentrating, on, posture, rather, than, dancing, because, of, this, many, ballet, programs, have, historically, not, accepted, students, until, approximately, age, 8, creative, movement, and, non, demanding, pre, ballet, classes, are, recommended, as, alternatives, for, children, the, french, method, is, the, basis, of, all, ballet, training, when, louis, xiv, created, the, acad, mie, royale, de, danse, in, 1661, he, helped, to, create, the, codified, technique, still, used, today, by, those, in, the, profession, regardless, of, what, method, of, training, they, adhere, to, the, french, school, was, particularly, revitalized, under, rudolf, nureyev, in, the, 1980s, his, influence, revitalized, and, renewed, appreciation, for, this, style, and, has, drastically, shaped, ballet, as, a, whole, in, fact, the, french, school, is, now, sometimes, referred, to, as, nureyev, school, the, french, method, is, often, characterized, by, technical, precision, fluidity, and, gracefulness, and, elegant, clean, lines, for, this, style, fast, footwork, is, often, utilized, in, order, to, give, the, impression, that, the, performers, are, drifting, lightly, across, the, stage, two, important, trademarks, of, this, technique, are, the, specific, way, in, which, the, port, de, bras, and, the, paulement, are, performed, more, rounded, than, when, dancing, in, a, russian, style, but, not, as, rounded, as, the, danish, style, the, vaganova, method, is, a, style, of, ballet, training, that, emerged, from, russian, ballet, created, by, agrippina, vaganova, after, retiring, from, dance, in, 1916, vaganova, turned, to, teaching, at, the, leningrad, choreographic, school, in, 1921, her, training, method, is, now, internationally, recognized, and, her, book, the, fundamentals, of, classical, dance, 1934, is, a, classic, reference, this, method, is, marked, by, the, fusion, of, the, classical, french, style, specifically, elements, from, the, romantic, era, with, the, athleticism, of, the, italian, method, and, the, soulful, passion, of, russian, ballet, she, developed, an, extremely, precise, method, of, instruction, in, her, book, basic, principles, of, russian, classical, dance, 1948, this, includes, outlining, when, to, teach, technical, components, to, students, in, their, ballet, careers, for, how, long, to, focus, on, it, and, the, right, amount, of, focus, at, each, stage, of, the, student, s, career, these, textbooks, continue, to, be, extremely, important, to, the, instruction, of, ballet, today, the, method, emphasizes, development, of, strength, flexibility, and, endurance, for, the, proper, performance, of, ballet, she, espoused, the, belief, that, equal, importance, should, be, placed, on, the, arms, and, legs, while, performing, ballet, as, this, will, bring, harmony, and, greater, expression, to, the, body, as, a, whole, developed, by, enrico, cecchetti, 1850, 1928, this, method, is, one, known, internationally, for, its, intense, reliance, of, the, understanding, of, anatomy, as, it, relates, to, classical, ballet, the, goal, of, this, method, is, to, instill, important, characteristics, for, the, performance, of, ballet, into, students, so, that, they, do, not, need, to, rely, on, imitations, of, teachers, important, components, for, this, method, is, the, emphasis, of, balance, elevations, ballon, poise, and, strength, this, method, espouses, the, importance, of, recognizing, that, all, parts, of, the, body, move, together, to, create, beautiful, graceful, lines, and, as, such, cautions, against, thinking, of, ballet, in, terms, of, the, arms, legs, and, neck, and, torso, as, separate, parts, this, method, is, well, known, for, eight, port, de, bras, that, are, utilized, the, bournonville, method, is, a, danish, method, first, devised, by, august, bournonville, bournonville, was, heavily, influenced, by, the, early, french, ballet, method, due, to, his, training, with, his, father, antoine, bournonville, and, other, important, french, ballet, masters, this, method, has, many, style, differences, that, differentiate, it, from, other, ballet, methods, taught, today, a, key, component, is, the, use, of, diagonal, paulements, with, the, upper, body, turning, towards, the, working, foot, typically, this, method, also, incorporates, very, basic, use, of, arms, pirouettes, from, a, low, d, velopp, position, into, seconde, and, use, of, fifth, position, bras, en, bas, for, the, beginning, and, end, of, movements, the, bournonville, method, produces, dancers, who, have, beautiful, ballon, the, illusion, of, imponderable, lightness, the, royal, academy, of, dance, method, also, referred, to, as, the, english, style, of, ballet, was, established, in, 1920, by, genee, karsavina, bedells, e, espinosa, and, richardson, the, goal, of, this, method, is, to, promote, academic, training, in, classical, ballet, throughout, great, britain, this, style, also, spread, to, the, united, states, and, is, widely, utilized, still, today, there, are, specific, grade, levels, which, a, student, must, move, through, in, order, to, complete, training, in, this, method, the, key, principle, behind, this, method, of, instruction, is, that, basic, ballet, technique, must, be, taught, at, a, slow, pace, with, difficulty, progression, often, much, slower, than, the, rest, of, the, methods, the, idea, behind, this, is, if, a, student, is, to, put, in, a, large, amount, of, effort, into, perfecting, the, basic, steps, the, technique, learned, in, these, steps, allow, a, student, to, utilize, harder, ones, at, a, much, easier, rate, developed, by, george, balanchine, at, the, new, york, city, ballet, his, method, draws, heavily, on, his, own, training, as, a, dancer, in, russia, the, technique, is, known, for, extreme, speed, throughout, routines, emphasis, on, lines, and, deep, pli, s, perhaps, one, of, the, most, well, known, differences, of, this, style, is, the, unorthodox, positioning, of, the, body, dancers, of, this, style, often, have, flexed, hands, and, even, feet, and, are, placed, in, off, balance, positions, important, ballet, studios, teaching, this, method, are, the, miami, city, ballet, ballet, chicago, studio, company, and, the, school, of, american, ballet, in, new, york, ballet, costumes, play, an, important, role, in, the, ballet, community, they, are, often, the, only, survival, of, a, production, representing, a, living, imaginary, picture, of, the, scene, the, roots, of, ballet, go, back, to, the, renaissance, in, france, and, italy, when, court, wear, was, the, beginning, of, ballet, costumes, ballet, costumes, have, been, around, since, the, early, 15th, century, cotton, and, silk, were, mixed, with, flax, woven, into, semitransparent, gauze, to, create, exquisite, ballet, costumes, during, the, 17th, century, different, types, of, fabrics, and, designs, were, used, to, make, costumes, more, spectacular, and, eye, catching, court, dress, still, remained, for, women, during, this, century, silks, satins, and, fabrics, embroidered, with, real, gold, and, precious, stones, increased, the, level, of, spectacular, decoration, associated, with, ballet, costumes, women, s, costumes, also, consisted, of, heavy, garments, and, knee, long, skirts, which, made, it, difficult, for, them, to, create, much, movement, and, gesture, during, the, 18th, century, stage, costumes, were, still, very, similar, to, court, wear, but, progressed, over, time, mostly, due, to, the, french, dancer, and, ballet, master, jean, georges, noverre, 1727, 1810, whose, proposals, to, modernize, ballet, are, contained, in, his, revolutionary, lettres, sur, la, danse, et, les, ballets, 1760, noverre, s, book, altered, the, emphasis, in, a, production, away, from, the, costumes, towards, the, physical, movements, and, emotions, of, the, dancers, european, ballet, was, centered, in, the, paris, opera, during, this, era, skirts, were, raised, a, few, inches, off, the, ground, flowers, flounces, ribbons, and, lace, emphasized, this, opulent, feminine, style, as, soft, pastel, tones, in, citron, peach, pink, and, pistachio, dominated, the, color, range, during, the, early, 19th, century, close, fitting, body, costumes, floral, crowns, corsages, and, jewels, were, used, ideals, of, romanticism, were, reflected, through, female, movements, costumes, became, much, tighter, as, corsets, started, to, come, into, use, to, show, off, the, curves, on, a, ballerina, jewels, and, bedazzled, costumes, became, much, more, popular, during, the, 20th, century, ballet, costumes, transitioned, back, to, the, influence, of, russian, ballet, ballerina, skirts, became, knee, length, tutus, later, on, in, order, to, show, off, their, precise, pointe, work, colors, used, on, stage, costumes, also, became, much, more, vibrant, designers, used, colors, such, as, red, orange, yellow, etc, to, create, visual, expression, when, ballet, dancers, perform, on, stage, professional, dancers, are, generally, not, well, paid, and, earn, less, money, than, a, typical, worker, as, of, 2020, american, dancers, including, ballet, and, other, dance, forms, were, paid, an, average, of, us, 19, per, hour, with, pay, somewhat, better, for, teachers, than, for, performers, the, job, outlook, is, not, strong, and, the, competition, to, get, a, job, is, intense, with, the, number, of, applicants, vastly, exceeding, the, number, of, job, openings, most, jobs, involve, teaching, in, private, dance, schools, choreographers, are, paid, better, than, dancers, musicians, and, singers, are, paid, better, per, hour, than, either, dancers, or, choreographers, about, us, 30, per, hour, however, full, time, work, is, unusual, for, musicians, teenage, girl, ballet, dancers, are, prone, to, stress, fractures, in, the, first, rib, posterior, ankle, impingement, syndrome, pais, most, commonly, affects, people, who, perform, repetitive, plantar, flexion, such, as, ballet, dancers, eating, disorders, are, thought, to, be, common, and, a, 2014, meta, analysis, suggests, that, studies, do, indicate, that, ballet, dancers, are, at, higher, risk, than, the, general, population, for, several, kinds, of, eating, disorders, in, addition, some, researchers, have, noted, that, intensive, training, in, ballet, results, in, lower, bone, mineral, density, in, the, arms, most, ballet, choreography, is, written, so, that, it, can, only, be, performed, by, a, relatively, young, dancer, the, structure, of, ballet, in, which, a, usually, male, choreographer, or, director, uses, mostly, women, s, bodies, to, express, his, artistic, vision, has, been, criticized, as, harming, women
