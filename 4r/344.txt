plucked, the, trombone, german, posaune, italian, french, trombone, is, a, musical, instrument, in, the, brass, family, as, with, all, brass, instruments, sound, is, produced, when, the, player, s, vibrating, lips, cause, the, air, column, inside, the, instrument, to, vibrate, nearly, all, trombones, use, a, telescoping, slide, mechanism, to, alter, the, pitch, instead, of, the, valves, used, by, other, brass, instruments, the, valve, trombone, is, an, exception, using, three, valves, similar, to, those, on, a, trumpet, and, the, superbone, has, valves, and, a, slide, the, word, trombone, derives, from, italian, tromba, trumpet, and, one, a, suffix, meaning, large, so, the, name, means, large, trumpet, the, trombone, has, a, predominantly, cylindrical, bore, like, the, trumpet, in, contrast, to, the, more, conical, brass, instruments, like, the, cornet, the, flugelhorn, the, baritone, and, the, euphonium, the, most, frequently, encountered, trombones, are, the, tenor, trombone, and, bass, trombone, these, are, treated, as, non, transposing, instruments, reading, at, concert, pitch, in, bass, clef, with, higher, notes, sometimes, being, notated, in, tenor, clef, they, are, pitched, in, b, an, octave, below, the, b, trumpet, and, an, octave, above, the, b, bass, tuba, the, once, common, e, alto, trombone, became, less, common, as, improvements, in, technique, extended, the, upper, range, of, the, tenor, but, it, is, regaining, popularity, for, its, lighter, sonority, in, british, brass, band, music, the, tenor, trombone, is, treated, as, a, b, transposing, instrument, written, in, treble, clef, and, the, alto, trombone, is, written, at, concert, pitch, usually, in, alto, clef, a, person, who, plays, the, trombone, is, called, a, trombonist, or, trombone, player, trombone, comes, from, the, italian, word, tromba, trumpet, plus, the, suffix, one, large, meaning, large, trumpet, during, the, renaissance, the, equivalent, english, term, was, sackbut, the, word, first, appears, in, court, records, in, 1495, as, shakbusshe, shakbusshe, is, similar, to, sacabuche, attested, in, spain, as, early, as, 1478, the, french, equivalent, saqueboute, appears, in, 1466, the, german, posaune, long, predates, the, invention, of, the, slide, and, could, refer, to, a, natural, trumpet, as, late, as, the, early, fifteenth, century, the, sackbut, appeared, in, the, 15th, century, and, was, used, extensively, across, europe, declining, in, most, places, by, the, mid, to, late, 17th, century, it, was, used, in, outdoor, events, in, concert, and, in, liturgical, settings, its, principal, role, was, as, the, contratenor, part, in, a, dance, band, it, was, also, used, along, with, shawms, in, bands, sponsored, by, towns, and, courts, trumpeters, and, trombonists, were, employed, in, german, city, states, to, stand, watch, in, the, city, towers, and, herald, the, arrival, of, important, people, to, the, city, an, activity, that, signified, wealth, and, strength, in, 16th, century, german, cities, these, heralding, trombonists, were, often, viewed, separately, from, the, more, skilled, trombonists, who, played, in, groups, such, as, the, alta, capella, wind, ensembles, and, the, first, orchestral, ensembles, which, performed, in, religious, settings, such, as, st, mark, s, basilica, in, venice, in, the, early, 17th, century, the, 17th, century, trombone, had, slightly, smaller, dimensions, than, a, modern, trombone, with, a, bell, that, was, more, conical, and, less, flared, modern, period, performers, use, the, term, sackbut, to, distinguish, this, earlier, version, of, the, trombone, from, the, modern, instrument, composers, who, wrote, for, trombone, during, this, period, include, claudio, monteverdi, heinrich, sch, tz, giovanni, gabrieli, and, his, uncle, andrea, gabrieli, the, trombone, doubled, voice, parts, in, sacred, works, but, there, are, also, solo, pieces, written, for, trombone, in, the, early, 17th, century, when, the, sackbut, returned, to, common, use, in, england, in, the, 18th, century, italian, music, was, so, influential, that, the, instrument, became, known, by, its, italian, name, trombone, its, name, remained, constant, in, italy, trombone, and, in, germany, posaune, during, the, later, baroque, period, johann, sebastian, bach, and, george, frideric, handel, used, trombones, on, a, few, occasions, bach, called, for, a, tromba, di, tirarsi, which, may, have, been, a, form, of, the, closely, related, slide, trumpet, to, double, the, cantus, firmus, in, some, liturgical, cantatas, he, also, employed, a, choir, of, four, trombones, to, double, the, chorus, in, three, of, his, cantatas, bwv, 2, bwv, 21, and, bwv, 38, and, used, three, trombones, and, a, cornett, in, the, cantata, bwv, 25, handel, used, it, in, samson, in, israel, in, egypt, and, in, the, death, march, from, saul, all, were, examples, of, an, oratorio, style, popular, during, the, early, 18th, century, score, notations, are, rare, because, only, a, few, professional, stadtpfeiffer, or, alta, cappella, musicians, were, available, handel, for, instance, had, to, import, trombones, to, england, from, a, royal, court, in, hanover, germany, to, perform, one, of, his, larger, compositions, because, of, the, relative, scarcity, of, trombones, their, solo, parts, were, generally, interchangeable, with, other, instruments, the, construction, of, the, trombone, did, not, change, very, much, between, the, baroque, and, classical, period, but, the, bell, became, slightly, more, flared, christoph, willibald, gluck, was, the, first, major, composer, to, use, the, trombone, in, an, opera, overture, in, the, opera, alceste, 1767, he, also, used, it, in, the, operas, orfeo, ed, euridice, iphig, nie, en, tauride, 1779, and, echo, et, narcisse, early, classical, composers, occasionally, included, concertante, movements, with, alto, trombone, as, a, solo, instrument, in, divertimenti, and, serenades, these, movements, are, often, extracted, from, the, multi, movement, works, and, performed, as, standalone, alto, trombone, concerti, examples, include, the, serenade, in, e, 1755, by, leopold, mozart, and, divertimento, in, d, major, 1764, by, michael, haydn, the, earliest, known, independent, trombone, concerto, is, probably, the, concerto, for, alto, trombone, and, strings, in, b, 1769, by, johann, georg, albrechtsberger, mozart, used, the, trombone, in, operas, notably, in, scenes, featuring, the, commendatore, in, don, giovanni, and, in, sacred, music, the, prominent, solo, part, in, the, tuba, mirum, section, of, his, requiem, became, a, staple, audition, piece, for, the, instrument, aside, from, solo, parts, mozart, s, orchestration, usually, features, a, trio, of, alto, tenor, and, bass, trombones, doubling, the, respective, voices, in, the, choir, the, earliest, known, symphony, featuring, a, trombone, section, is, symphony, in, c, minor, by, anton, zimmermann, the, date, is, uncertain, but, it, is, most, probably, from, the, peak, of, the, composer, s, activity, in, the, 1770s, the, earliest, confident, date, for, introducing, the, trombone, to, the, symphony, is, therefore, zimmermann, s, death, in, 1781, symphony, in, e, 1807, by, swedish, composer, joachim, nicolas, eggert, features, an, independent, trombone, part, ludwig, van, beethoven, is, sometimes, mistakenly, credited, with, the, trombone, s, introduction, into, the, orchestra, having, used, it, shortly, afterwards, in, his, symphony, no, 5, in, c, minor, 1808, symphony, no, 6, in, f, major, pastoral, and, symphony, no, 9, choral, trombones, were, included, in, operas, symphonies, and, other, compositions, by, felix, mendelssohn, hector, berlioz, franz, berwald, charles, gounod, franz, liszt, gioacchino, rossini, franz, schubert, robert, schumann, giuseppe, verdi, and, richard, wagner, and, others, the, trombone, trio, was, combined, with, one, or, two, cornetts, during, the, renaissance, and, early, baroque, periods, the, replacement, of, cornetts, with, oboes, and, clarinets, did, not, change, the, trombone, s, role, as, a, support, to, the, alto, tenor, and, bass, voices, of, the, chorus, usually, in, ecclesiastical, settings, whose, moving, harmonic, lines, were, more, difficult, to, pick, out, than, the, melodic, soprano, line, the, introduction, of, trombones, into, the, orchestra, allied, them, more, closely, with, trumpets, and, soon, a, tenor, trombone, replaced, the, alto, the, germans, and, austrians, kept, alto, trombone, somewhat, longer, than, the, french, who, preferred, a, section, of, three, tenor, trombones, until, after, the, second, world, war, in, other, countries, the, trio, of, two, tenor, trombones, and, one, bass, became, standard, by, about, the, mid, 19th, century, trombonists, were, employed, less, by, court, orchestras, and, cathedrals, who, had, been, providing, the, instruments, military, musicians, were, provided, with, instruments, and, instruments, like, the, long, f, or, e, bass, trombone, remained, in, military, use, until, around, the, first, world, war, orchestral, musicians, adopted, the, tenor, trombone, as, it, could, generally, play, any, of, the, three, trombone, parts, in, orchestral, scores, valve, trombones, in, the, mid, 19th, century, did, little, to, alter, the, make, up, of, the, orchestral, trombone, section, while, its, use, declined, in, german, and, french, orchestras, the, valve, trombone, remained, popular, in, some, countries, including, italy, and, bohemia, almost, to, the, exclusion, of, the, slide, instrument, composers, such, as, giuseppe, verdi, giacomo, puccini, bed, ich, smetana, and, anton, n, dvo, k, scored, for, a, valve, trombone, section, as, the, ophicleide, or, the, tuba, was, added, to, the, orchestra, during, the, 19th, century, bass, trombone, parts, were, scored, in, a, higher, register, than, previously, the, bass, trombone, regained, some, independence, in, the, early, 20th, century, experiments, with, the, trombone, section, included, richard, wagner, s, addition, of, a, contrabass, trombone, in, der, ring, des, nibelungen, and, gustav, mahler, s, and, richard, strauss, addition, of, a, second, bass, trombone, to, the, usual, trio, of, two, tenors, and, one, bass, the, majority, of, orchestral, works, are, still, scored, for, the, usual, mid, to, late, 19th, century, low, brass, section, of, two, tenor, trombones, one, bass, trombone, and, one, tuba, wind, bands, began, during, the, french, revolution, of, 1791, and, have, always, included, trombones, they, became, more, established, in, the, 19th, century, and, included, circus, bands, military, bands, brass, bands, primarily, in, the, uk, and, town, bands, primarily, in, the, us, some, of, these, especially, military, bands, in, europe, used, rear, facing, trombones, with, the, bell, pointing, behind, the, player, s, left, shoulder, these, bands, played, a, limited, repertoire, that, consisted, mainly, of, orchestral, transcriptions, arrangements, of, popular, and, patriotic, tunes, and, feature, pieces, for, soloists, usually, cornetists, singers, and, violinists, a, notable, work, for, wind, band, is, berlioz, s, 1840, grande, symphonie, fun, bre, et, triomphale, which, uses, a, trombone, solo, for, the, entire, second, movement, toward, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, trombone, virtuosi, began, appearing, as, soloists, in, american, wind, bands, arthur, pryor, who, played, with, the, john, philip, sousa, band, and, formed, his, own, band, was, one, of, the, most, famous, of, these, trombonists, in, the, romantic, era, leipzig, became, a, center, of, trombone, pedagogy, and, the, instrument, was, taught, at, the, musikhochschule, founded, by, felix, mendelssohn, bartholdy, the, paris, conservatory, and, its, yearly, exhibition, also, contributed, to, trombone, education, at, the, leipzig, academy, mendelssohn, s, bass, trombonist, karl, traugott, queisser, was, the, first, in, a, long, line, of, distinguished, professors, of, the, trombone, several, composers, wrote, works, for, queisser, including, mendelssohn, s, concertmaster, ferdinand, david, ernst, sachse, and, friedrich, august, belcke, david, wrote, his, concertino, for, trombone, and, orchestra, in, 1837, and, sachse, s, solo, works, remain, popular, in, germany, queisser, championed, and, popularized, christian, friedrich, sattler, s, tenor, bass, trombone, during, the, 1840s, leading, to, its, widespread, use, in, orchestras, throughout, germany, and, austria, sattler, had, a, great, influence, on, trombone, design, introducing, a, significantly, larger, bore, the, most, important, innovation, since, the, renaissance, schlangenverzierungen, snake, decorations, the, bell, garland, and, the, wide, bell, flare, these, features, were, widely, copied, during, the, 19th, century, and, are, still, found, on, german, made, trombones, the, trombone, was, improved, in, the, 19th, century, with, the, addition, of, stockings, at, the, end, of, the, inner, slide, to, reduce, friction, the, development, of, the, water, key, to, expel, condensation, from, the, horn, and, the, occasional, addition, of, a, valve, that, was, designed, to, be, set, in, a, single, position, but, later, became, the, modern, f, valve, the, valve, trombone, appeared, around, the, 1850s, shortly, after, the, invention, of, valves, and, was, in, common, use, in, italy, and, austria, in, the, second, half, of, the, century, in, the, 20th, century, the, trombone, maintained, its, important, place, in, the, orchestra, in, works, by, b, la, bart, k, alban, berg, leonard, bernstein, benjamin, britten, aaron, copland, edward, elgar, george, gershwin, gustav, holst, leos, janacek, gustav, mahler, olivier, messiaen, darius, milhaud, carl, nielsen, sergei, prokofiev, sergei, rachmaninoff, maurice, ravel, ottorino, respighi, arnold, schoenberg, dmitri, shostakovich, jean, sibelius, richard, strauss, igor, stravinsky, ralph, vaughan, williams, heitor, villa, lobos, and, william, walton, with, the, rise, of, recorded, music, and, music, schools, orchestral, trombone, sections, around, the, world, began, to, have, a, more, consistent, idea, of, a, standard, trombone, sound, in, the, 1940s, british, orchestras, abandoned, the, use, of, small, bore, tenors, and, g, basses, in, favor, of, the, american, german, choice, of, large, bore, tenors, and, b, basses, french, orchestras, did, the, same, in, the, 1960s, during, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, the, popularity, of, touring, and, community, concert, bands, in, the, united, states, decreased, at, the, same, time, the, development, of, music, education, in, the, public, school, system, made, high, school, and, university, concert, bands, and, marching, bands, ubiquitous, a, typical, concert, band, trombone, section, consists, of, two, tenor, trombones, and, one, bass, trombone, but, using, multiple, players, per, part, is, common, practice, especially, in, public, school, settings, in, the, 1900s, the, trombone, and, the, tuba, played, bass, lines, and, outlined, chords, to, support, improvisation, by, the, higher, pitched, instruments, it, began, to, be, used, as, a, solo, instrument, during, the, swing, era, of, the, mid, 1920s, jack, teagarden, and, j, j, johnson, were, early, trombone, soloists, the, trombone, s, construction, changed, in, the, 20th, century, different, materials, were, used, mouthpiece, bore, and, bell, dimensions, increased, and, different, mutes, and, valves, were, developed, despite, the, overall, trend, towards, larger, bore, instruments, many, european, trombone, makers, prefer, a, slightly, smaller, bore, than, their, american, counterparts, one, of, the, most, significant, changes, was, the, development, of, the, f, attachment, trigger, through, the, mid, 20th, century, there, was, no, need, for, orchestral, trombonists, to, use, instruments, with, the, f, attachment, trigger, as, contemporary, composers, such, as, mahler, began, to, write, lower, passages, for, the, trombone, the, trigger, became, necessary, the, trombone, can, be, found, in, symphony, orchestras, concert, bands, big, bands, marching, bands, military, bands, brass, bands, and, brass, choirs, in, chamber, music, it, is, used, in, brass, quintets, quartets, and, trios, and, also, in, trombone, trios, quartets, or, choirs, the, size, of, a, trombone, choir, can, vary, from, five, or, six, to, twenty, or, more, members, trombones, are, also, common, in, swing, jazz, merengue, salsa, r, b, ska, and, new, orleans, brass, bands, the, trombone, is, a, predominantly, cylindrical, tube, with, two, u, shaped, bends, and, a, flared, bell, at, the, end, the, tubing, is, approximately, cylindrical, but, contains, a, complex, series, of, tapers, which, affect, the, instrument, s, intonation, as, with, other, brass, instruments, sound, is, produced, by, blowing, air, through, pursed, lips, producing, a, vibration, that, creates, a, standing, wave, in, the, instrument, the, detachable, cup, shaped, mouthpiece, is, similar, to, that, of, the, baritone, horn, and, closely, related, to, that, of, the, trumpet, it, has, a, venturi, a, small, constriction, of, the, air, column, that, adds, resistance, greatly, affecting, the, tone, of, the, instrument, the, slide, section, consists, of, a, leadpipe, inner, and, outer, slide, tubes, and, bracing, or, stays, the, soldered, stays, on, modern, instruments, replaced, the, loose, stays, found, on, sackbuts, medieval, precursors, to, trombones, the, most, distinctive, feature, of, the, trombone, is, the, slide, that, lengthens, the, tubing, and, lowers, the, pitch, cf, valve, trombone, during, the, renaissance, sleeves, called, stockings, were, developed, to, decrease, friction, that, would, impede, the, slide, s, motion, these, were, soldered, onto, the, ends, of, the, inner, slide, tubes, to, slightly, increase, their, diameter, the, ends, of, inner, slides, on, modern, instruments, are, manufactured, with, a, slightly, larger, diameter, to, achieve, the, same, end, this, part, of, the, slide, must, be, lubricated, frequently, the, slide, section, is, connected, to, the, bell, section, by, the, neckpipe, and, a, u, bend, called, the, bell, or, back, bow, the, joint, connecting, the, slide, and, bell, sections, has, a, threaded, collar, to, secure, the, connection, prior, to, the, early, 20th, century, this, connection, was, made, with, friction, joints, alone, trombones, have, a, short, tuning, slide, in, the, u, shaped, bend, between, the, neckpipe, and, the, bell, a, feature, designed, by, the, french, maker, fran, ois, riedlocker, in, the, early, 19th, century, it, was, incorporated, into, french, and, british, designs, and, later, to, german, and, american, models, although, german, trombones, were, built, without, tuning, slides, well, into, the, 20th, century, many, types, of, trombone, also, include, one, or, more, rotary, valves, connected, to, additional, tubing, which, lengthens, the, instrument, this, extends, the, low, range, of, the, instrument, and, creates, the, option, of, using, alternate, slide, positions, for, many, notes, like, the, trumpet, the, trombone, is, considered, a, cylindrical, bore, instrument, since, it, has, extensive, sections, of, tubing, that, are, of, unchanging, diameter, the, slide, section, must, be, cylindrical, in, order, to, function, tenor, trombones, typically, have, a, bore, of, 0, 450, inches, 11, 4, mm, small, bore, to, 0, 547, inches, 13, 9, mm, large, or, orchestral, bore, after, the, leadpipe, and, through, the, slide, the, bore, expands, through, the, bow, to, the, bell, which, is, typically, between, 7, and, 8, 1, 2, inches, 18, and, 22, cm, a, number, of, common, variations, on, trombone, construction, are, noted, below, trombone, bells, and, sometimes, slides, may, be, constructed, of, different, brass, mixtures, the, most, common, material, is, yellow, brass, 70, copper, 30, zinc, but, other, materials, include, rose, brass, 85, copper, 15, zinc, and, red, brass, 90, copper, 10, zinc, some, manufacturers, offer, interchangeable, bells, tenor, trombone, bells, are, usually, between, 7, and, 9, in, 18, 23, cm, in, diameter, with, most, being, between, 7, 1, 2, and, 8, 1, 2, in, 19, 22, cm, the, smallest, sizes, are, found, on, jazz, trombones, and, older, narrow, bore, instruments, while, the, larger, sizes, are, common, on, orchestral, models, bass, trombone, bells, can, be, 10, 1, 2, in, 27, cm, or, more, with, most, being, between, 9, 1, 2, and, 10, in, 24, and, 25, cm, the, bell, may, be, made, from, two, separate, brass, sheets, or, from, one, single, piece, of, metal, hammered, on, a, mandrel, to, shape, it, the, edge, of, the, bell, may, be, finished, with, or, without, a, piece, of, bell, wire, to, secure, it, which, also, affects, the, tone, quality, most, bells, are, built, with, bell, wire, occasionally, trombone, bells, are, made, from, solid, sterling, silver, modern, trombones, often, have, a, valve, attachment, an, extra, loop, of, tubing, attached, to, the, bell, section, and, engaged, by, a, valve, operated, by, the, left, hand, by, means, of, a, lever, or, trigger, the, valve, attachment, aids, in, increasing, the, lower, range, of, the, instrument, while, also, allowing, alternate, slide, positions, for, difficult, music, passages, a, valve, can, also, make, trills, easier, the, valve, attachment, was, originally, developed, by, german, instrument, maker, christian, friedrich, sattler, in, the, late, 1830s, for, the, tenorba, posaune, lit, tenor, bass, trombone, a, b, tenor, trombone, built, with, the, wider, bore, and, larger, bell, of, a, bass, trombone, that, sattler, had, earlier, invented, in, 1821, sattler, s, valve, attachment, added, about, 3, feet, 0, 9, m, of, tubing, to, lower, the, fundamental, pitch, from, b, to, f, controlled, by, a, rotary, valve, and, is, essentially, unchanged, in, modern, instruments, valve, attachments, are, most, commonly, found, on, tenor, and, bass, trombones, but, they, can, appear, on, sizes, from, soprano, to, contrabass, the, most, common, type, of, valve, seen, for, valve, attachments, is, the, rotary, valve, appearing, on, most, band, instruments, as, well, as, most, student, and, intermediate, model, trombones, many, improvements, of, the, rotary, valve, as, well, as, entirely, new, and, radically, different, valve, designs, have, been, invented, since, the, mid, 20th, century, to, give, the, trombone, a, more, open, free, sound, than, the, tight, bends, in, conventional, rotary, valve, designs, would, allow, many, of, these, new, valve, designs, have, been, widely, adopted, by, players, especially, in, symphony, orchestras, the, thayer, axial, flow, valve, is, offered, on, professional, models, from, most, trombone, manufacturers, and, the, hagmann, valve, particularly, from, european, manufacturers, some, trombones, have, three, piston, or, rotary, valves, instead, of, a, slide, see, valve, trombone, f, attachment, tubing, usually, has, a, larger, bore, through, the, attachment, than, through, the, rest, of, the, instrument, a, typical, slide, bore, for, an, orchestral, tenor, trombone, is, 0, 547, in, 13, 9, mm, while, the, bore, in, the, attachment, is, 0, 562, in, 14, 3, mm, the, attachment, tubing, also, incorporates, a, tuning, slide, to, tune, the, valve, separately, from, the, rest, of, the, instrument, usually, long, enough, to, lower, the, pitch, by, a, semitone, when, fully, extended, from, f, to, e, on, tenor, and, bass, trombones, to, reach, the, missing, low, b, 1, originally, valve, attachment, tubing, was, always, coiled, tightly, to, keep, within, the, bell, section, closed, wrap, or, traditional, wrap, in, the, early, 1980s, american, instrument, manufacturers, began, producing, instruments, with, open, wrap, first, conceived, by, californian, instrument, technician, larry, minick, around, the, same, time, that, the, thayer, valve, began, to, emerge, among, orchestral, players, open, wrap, f, attachment, tubing, is, shaped, in, a, single, loop, free, of, tight, bends, resulting, in, a, freer, response, and, more, open, sound, through, the, valve, in, marching, bands, and, other, situations, where, the, trombone, may, be, more, prone, to, damage, the, confined, traditional, wrap, is, more, common, since, open, wrap, tubing, protrudes, behind, the, bell, section, some, trombones, are, tuned, using, a, mechanism, in, the, slide, section, instead, of, a, tuning, slide, in, the, bell, section, having, the, tuning, slide, in, the, bell, section, the, more, typical, setup, requires, two, sections, of, cylindrical, tubing, in, an, otherwise, conical, part, of, the, instrument, which, affects, the, tone,

0, 508, 0, 525, and, 0, 547, in, 12, 7, 12, 9, 13, 3, and, 13, 9, mm, for, tenor, trombones, and, 0, 562, in, 14, 3, mm, for, bass, trombones, the, slide, may, also, be, built, with, a, dual, bore, configuration, in, which, the, bore, of, the, second, leg, of, the, slide, is, slightly, larger, than, the, bore, of, the, first, leg, producing, a, stepwise, conical, effect, the, most, common, dual, bore, combinations, are, 0, 481, 0, 491, in, 12, 2, 12, 5, mm, 0, 500, 0, 508, in, 12, 7, 12, 9, mm, 0, 508, 0, 525, in, 12, 9, 13, 3, mm, 0, 525, 0, 547, in, 13, 3, 13, 9, mm, 0, 547, 0, 562, in, 13,

similarly, sized, trombones, from, different, manufacturers, available, mouthpieces, for, trombone, as, with, all, brass, instruments, vary, in, material, composition, length, diameter, rim, shape, cup, depth, throat, entrance, venturi, aperture, venturi, profile, outside, design, and, other, factors, variations, in, mouthpiece, construction, affect, the, individual, player, s, ability, to,

instrument, s, playability, in, a, given, pitch, range, mouthpiece, selection, is, a, highly, personal, decision, thus, a, symphonic, trombonist, might, prefer, a, mouthpiece, with, a, deeper, cup, and, sharper, inner, rim, shape, in, order, to, produce, a, rich, symphonic, tone, quality, while, a, jazz, trombonist, might, choose, a, shallower, cup, for, brighter, tone, and, easier, production, of, higher, notes, further, for, certain, compositions, these, choices, between, two, such, performers, could, easily, be, reversed, some, mouthpiece, makers, now, offer, mouthpieces, that, feature, removable, rims, cups, and, shanks, allowing, players, to, further, customize, and, adjust, their, mouthpieces, to, their, preference, instruments, made, mostly, from, plastic, including, the, pbone, and, the, tromba, plastic, trombone, emerged, in, the, 2010s, as, a, cheaper, and, more, robust, alternative, to, brass, plastic, instruments, could, come, in, almost, any, colour, but, the, sound, plastic, instruments, produce, is, different, from, that, of, brass, while, originally, seen, as, a, gimmick, these, plastic, models, have, found, increasing, popularity, of, the, last, decade, and, are, now, viewed, as, practice, tools, that, make, for, more, convenient, travel, as, well, as, a, cheaper, option, for, beginning, players, not, wishing, to, invest, so, much, money, in, a, trombone, right, away, manufacturers, now, produce, large, bore, models, with, triggers, as, well, as, smaller, alto, models, german, trombones, have, been, built, in, a, wide, variety, of, bore, and, bell, sizes, the, traditional, german, konzertposaune, can, differ, substantially, from, american, designs, in, many, aspects, the, mouthpiece, is, typically, rather, small, and, is, placed, into, a, slide, section, with, a, very, long, leadpipe, of, at, least, 12, to, 24, inches, 30, 60, cm, the, whole, instrument, is, typically, made, of, gold, brass, they, are, constructed, using, very, thin, metal, especially, in, the, bell, section, and, many, have, a, metal, ring, called, a, kranz, lit, wreath, on, the, rim, of, the, bell, their, sound, is, very, even, across, dynamic, levels, but, it, can, be, difficult, to, play, at, louder, volumes, while, their, bore, sizes, were, considered, large, in, the, 19th, century, german, trombones, have, altered, very, little, over, the, last, 150, years, and, are, now, typically, somewhat, smaller, than, their, american, counterparts, bell, sizes, remain, very, large, in, all, sizes, of, german, trombone, and, a, bass, trombone, bell, may, exceed, 10, inches, 25, cm, in, diameter, valve, attachments, in, tenor, and, bass, trombones, were, first, seen, in, the, mid, 19th, century, originally, on, the, tenor, b, trombone, before, 1850, bass, trombone, parts, were, mostly, played, on, a, slightly, longer, f, bass, trombone, a, fourth, lower, the, first, valve, was, simply, a, fourth, valve, or, in, german, quart, ventil, built, onto, a, b, tenor, trombone, to, allow, playing, in, low, f, this, valve, was, first, built, without, a, return, spring, and, was, only, intended, to, set, the, instrument, in, b, or, f, for, extended, passages, since, the, mid, 20th, century, modern, instruments, use, a, trigger, to, engage, the, valve, while, playing, as, with, other, traditional, german, and, austrian, brass, instruments, rotary, valves, are, used, to, the, exclusion, of, almost, all, other, types, of, valve, even, in, valve, trombones, other, features, often, found, on, german, trombones, include, long, water, keys, as, well, as, schlangenverzierungen, snake, decorations, on, the, slide, and, bell, u, bows, to, help, protect, the, tubing, from, damage, since, around, 1925, when, jazz, music, became, popular, germany, has, been, selling, american, trombones, as, well, most, trombones, made, and, or, played, in, germany, today, especially, by, amateurs, are, built, in, the, american, fashion, as, those, are, much, more, widely, available, and, thus, far, cheaper, however, some, higher, end, manufacturers, such, as, thein, make, modern, iterations, of, the, classic, german, konzertposaune, as, well, as, american, style, trombones, with, german, features, like, the, kranz, and, snake, decorations, french, trombones, were, built, in, the, very, smallest, bore, sizes, up, to, the, end, of, the, second, world, war, and, whilst, other, sizes, were, made, there, the, french, usually, preferred, the, tenor, trombone, to, any, other, size, french, music, therefore, usually, employed, a, section, of, three, tenor, trombones, up, to, the, mid, 20th, century, tenor, trombones, produced, in, france, during, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, featured, bore, sizes, of, around, 0, 450, in, 11, 4, mm, small, bells, of, not, more, than, 6, in, 15, cm, in, diameter, as, well, as, a, funnel, shaped, mouthpiece, slightly, larger, than, that, of, the, cornet, or, horn, french, tenor, trombones, were, built, in, both, c, and, b, altos, in, d, sopranos, in, f, piccolos, in, b, basses, in, g, and, e, and, contrabasses, in, b, the, most, frequently, encountered, types, of, trombone, today, are, the, tenor, and, bass, though, as, with, many, other, instrument, families, such, as, the, clarinet, the, trombone, has, been, built, in, sizes, from, piccolo, to, contrabass, although, trombones, are, usually, constructed, with, a, slide, to, change, the, pitch, valve, trombones, instead, use, the, set, of, three, valves, common, on, other, brass, instruments, the, contrabass, trombone, is, the, lowest, trombone, first, appearing, in, bb, an, octave, below, the, tenor, with, a, double, slide, this, design, was, commissioned, by, wagner, in, the, 1870s, for, his, der, ring, des, nibelungen, opera, cycle, since, the, late, 20th, century, however, it, has, largely, been, supplanted, by, a, less, cumbersome, single, slide, bass, contrabass, instrument, pitched, in, 12, f, with, two, valve, attachments, to, provide, the, same, full, range, as, its, predecessor, this, design, is, effectively, a, modern, bass, trombone, built, down, a, perfect, fourth, although, the, contrabass, has, only, appeared, occasionally, in, orchestral, repertoire, and, is, not, a, permanent, member, of, the, modern, orchestra, it, has, enjoyed, a, revival, in, the, 21st, century, particularly, in, film, and, video, game, soundtracks, although, early, instruments, were, pitched, in, g, f, or, e, below, the, tenor, trombone, the, modern, bass, trombone, is, pitched, in, the, same, b, as, the, tenor, but, with, a, wider, bore, a, larger, bell, and, a, larger, mouthpiece, these, features, facilitate, playing, in, the, lower, register, of, the, instrument, modern, bass, trombones, have, valves, that, allow, a, fully, chromatic, range, down, to, the, pedal, register, b, 1, in, britain, the, bass, trombone, in, g, was, used, in, orchestras, from, the, mid, 19th, century, and, survived, into, the, 1950s, particularly, in, british, brass, bands, the, tenor, trombone, has, a, fundamental, note, of, b, and, is, usually, treated, as, a, non, transposing, instrument, see, below, tenor, trombones, with, c, as, their, fundamental, note, were, almost, equally, popular, in, the, mid, 19th, century, in, britain, and, france, as, the, trombone, in, its, simplest, form, has, neither, crooks, valves, nor, keys, to, lower, the, pitch, by, a, specific, interval, trombonists, use, seven, chromatic, slide, positions, each, position, progressively, increases, the, length, of, the, air, column, thus, lowering, the, pitch, extending, the, slide, from, one, position, to, the, next, lowers, the, pitch, by, one, semitone, thus, each, note, in, the, harmonic, series, can, be, lowered, by, an, interval, of, up, to, a, tritone, the, lowest, note, of, the, standard, instrument, is, therefore, an, e, a, tritone, below, b, most, experienced, trombonists, can, play, lower, falset, notes, and, much, lower, pedal, notes, first, partials, or, fundamentals, which, have, a, peculiar, metallic, rumbling, sound, slide, positions, are, subject, to, adjustment, compensating, for, imperfections, in, the, tuning, of, different, harmonics, the, fifth, partial, is, rather, flat, on, most, trombones, and, usually, requires, a, minute, shortening, of, the, slide, position, to, compensate, other, small, adjustments, are, also, normally, required, throughout, the, range, trombonists, make, frequent, use, of, alternate, positions, to, minimize, slide, movement, in, rapid, passages, for, instance, b, 3, may, be, played, in, first, or, fifth, position, alternate, positions, are, also, needed, to, allow, a, player, to, produce, a, glissando, to, or, from, a, higher, note, on, the, same, partial, while, the, lowest, note, of, the, tenor, trombone, s, range, excluding, fundamentals, or, pedal, notes, is, e, 2, the, trombone, s, upper, range, is, theoretically, open, ended, the, practical, top, of, the, range, is, sometimes, considered, to, be, f, 5, or, more, conservatively, d, 5, the, range, of, the, c, tenor, trombone, is, f, 2, to, g, 5, the, alto, trombone, is, smaller, than, the, tenor, trombone, and, almost, always, pitched, in, e, a, fourth, higher, than, the, tenor, although, examples, pitched, in, f, are, occasionally, found, modern, instruments, are, sometimes, fitted, with, a, valve, to, lower, the, pitch, either, by, a, semitone, to, d, known, as, a, trill, valve, or, by, a, fourth, into, b, the, alto, trombone, was, commonly, used, in, the, 16th, to, the, 18th, centuries, in, church, music, to, strengthen, the, alto, voice, particularly, in, the, mass, early, 19th, century, composers, such, as, beethoven, brahms, and, schumann, began, writing, for, alto, trombone, in, their, symphonies, but, the, subsequent, use, and, popularity, of, tenor, trombones, in, the, orchestra, largely, eclipsed, their, use, until, a, modern, revival, that, began, in, the, late, 20th, century, the, soprano, trombone, is, usually, pitched, in, b, an, octave, above, the, tenor, and, has, seldom, been, used, since, its, first, known, appearance, in, 1677, outside, of, trombone, choirs, in, moravian, church, music, built, with, mouthpiece, bore, and, bell, dimensions, similar, to, the, b, trumpet, it, tends, to, be, played, by, trumpet, players, during, the, 20th, century, some, soprano, trombones, dubbed, slide, cornets, were, made, as, novelties, or, for, use, by, jazz, players, including, louis, armstrong, and, dizzy, gillespie, a, small, number, of, contemporary, proponents, of, the, instrument, include, jazz, artists, wycliffe, gordon, and, christian, scott, and, classical, trumpeter, torbj, rn, hultmark, who, advocates, for, its, use, as, an, instrument, for, young, children, to, learn, music, the, sopranino, and, piccolo, trombones, appeared, in, the, 1950s, as, novelty, instruments, and, are, even, smaller, and, higher, than, the, soprano, they, are, pitched, in, high, e, and, b, respectively, one, octave, above, the, alto, and, soprano, trombones, owing, to, being, essentially, a, slide, variant, of, the, piccolo, trumpet, they, are, played, primarily, by, trumpet, players, in, the, 19th, century, as, soon, as, brass, instrument, valves, were, invented, trombones, with, valves, instead, of, slides, were, adopted, widely, in, orchestras, and, remain, popular, in, some, parts, of, europe, and, in, military, bands, the, cimbasso, covers, the, same, range, as, a, tuba, or, a, contrabass, trombone, the, term, cimbasso, first, appeared, in, early, 19th, century, italian, opera, scores, and, originally, referred, to, an, upright, serpent, or, an, ophicleide, the, modern, cimbasso, first, appeared, as, the, trombone, basso, verdi, in, the, 1880s, and, has, three, to, six, piston, or, rotary, valves, and, a, predominantly, cylindrical, bore, they, are, most, often, pitched, in, 12, f, although, models, are, available, in, e, and, occasionally, 16, c, and, 18, b, the, cimbasso, is, most, commonly, used, in, performances, of, late, romantic, italian, operas, by, verdi, and, puccini, but, has, also, experienced, a, 21st, century, revival, in, film, television, and, video, game, soundtracks, a, hybrid, duplex, or, double, trombone, is, a, design, of, trombone, that, has, both, a, slide, and, a, set, of, three, valves, for, altering, the, pitch, it, has, been, reinvented, several, times, since, first, appearing, in, the, 19th, century, by, besson, and, later, conn, jazz, trombonist, and, machinist, brad, gowans, invented, his, valide, trombone, in, the, 1940s, with, a, short, four, position, slide, in, the, 1970s, maynard, ferguson, and, holton, produced, the, superbone, very, similar, to, the, earlier, conn, in, 2013, schagerl, in, collaboration, with, james, morrison, announced, a, larger, bore, variant, with, rotary, valves, the, flugabone, or, sometimes, flugelbone, portmanteau, of, flugelhorn, and, trombone, also, known, as, the, marching, trombone, is, a, marching, brass, instrument, essentially, a, valve, trombone, wrapped, into, a, compact, flugelhorn, shape, it, retains, the, cylindrical, bore, of, the, trombone, rather, than, the, conical, bore, of, either, the, flugelhorn, or, bugle, and, thus, is, similar, in, playing, characteristics, to, a, valve, trombone, a, similar, marching, trombone, is, the, trombonium, first, produced, by, king, musical, instruments, wrapped, and, held, vertically, like, a, euphonium, the, term, sackbut, refers, to, the, early, forms, of, the, trombone, commonly, used, during, the, renaissance, and, baroque, eras, with, a, characteristically, smaller, more, cylindrically, proportioned, bore, and, a, less, flared, bell, a, distinctive, form, of, tenor, trombone, was, popularized, in, france, in, the, early, 19th, century, called, the, buccin, it, featured, a, tenor, trombone, slide, and, a, bell, that, ended, in, a, zoomorphic, serpent, or, dragon, head, it, sounds, like, a, cross, between, a, trombone, and, a, french, horn, with, a, very, wide, dynamic, range, but, a, limited, and, variable, range, of, pitch, hector, berlioz, wrote, for, the, buccin, in, his, messe, solennelle, of, 1824, a, portmanteau, of, trombone, and, bassoon, the, tromboon, was, created, by, musical, parodist, peter, schickele, by, replacing, a, trombone, s, mouthpiece, with, the, reed, and, bocal, of, a, bassoon, it, appears, in, several, humorous, works, of, schickele, s, fictional, composer, p, d, q, bach, the, modern, system, has, seven, chromatic, slide, positions, on, a, tenor, trombone, in, b, it, was, first, described, by, andre, braun, circa, 1795, in, 1811, joseph, fr, hlich, wrote, on, the, differences, between, the, modern, system, and, an, old, system, where, four, diatonic, slide, positions, were, used, and, the, trombone, was, usually, keyed, to, a, to, compare, between, the, two, styles, the, chart, below, may, be, helpful, take, note, for, example, in, the, old, system, contemporary, 1st, position, was, considered, drawn, past, then, current, 1st, in, the, modern, system, each, successive, position, outward, approximately, 3, 1, 4, inches, will, produce, a, note, which, is, one, semitone, lower, when, played, in, the, same, partial, tightening, and, loosening, the, lips, will, allow, the, player, to, bend, the, note, up, or, down, by, a, semitone, without, changing, position, so, a, slightly, out, of, position, slide, may, be, compensated, for, by, ear, as, with, all, brass, instruments, progressive, tightening, of, the, lips, and, increased, air, pressure, allow, the, player, to, move, to, different, partial, in, the, harmonic, series, in, the, first, position, also, called, closed, position, on, a, b, trombone, the, notes, in, the, harmonic, series, begin, with, b, 2, one, octave, higher, than, the, pedal, b, 1, f, 3, a, perfect, fifth, higher, than, the, previous, partial, b, 3, a, perfect, fourth, higher, d, 4, a, major, third, higher, and, f, 4, a, minor, third, higher, f, 4, marks, the, sixth, partial, or, the, fifth, overtone, notes, on, the, next, partial, for, example, a, 4, a, minor, third, higher, in, first, position, tend, to, be, out, of, tune, in, regards, to, the, twelve, tone, equal, temperament, scale, a, 4, in, particular, which, is, at, the, seventh, partial, sixth, overtone, is, nearly, always, 31, cents, or, about, one, third, of, a, semitone, flat, of, the, minor, seventh, on, the, slide, trombone, such, deviations, from, intonation, are, corrected, for, by, slightly, adjusting, the, slide, or, by, using, an, alternate, position, although, much, of, western, music, has, adopted, the, even, tempered, scale, it, has, been, the, practice, in, germany, and, austria, to, play, these, notes, in, position, where, they, will, have, just, intonation, see, harmonic, seventh, as, well, for, a, 4, the, next, higher, partials, b, 4, a, major, second, higher, c, 5, a, major, second, higher, d, 5, a, major, second, higher, do, not, require, much, adjustment, for, even, tempered, intonation, but, e, 5, a, minor, second, higher, is, almost, exactly, a, quarter, tone, higher, than, it, would, be, in, twelve, tone, equal, temperament, e, 5, and, f, 5, a, major, second, higher, at, the, next, partial, are, very, high, notes, a, very, skilled, player, with, a, highly, developed, facial, musculature, and, diaphragm, can, go, even, higher, to, g, 5, a, 5, b, 5, and, beyond, the, higher, in, the, harmonic, series, any, two, successive, notes, are, the, closer, they, tend, to, be, as, evidenced, by, the, progressively, smaller, intervals, noted, above, a, byproduct, of, this, is, the, relatively, few, motions, needed, to, move, between, notes, in, the, higher, ranges, of, the, trombone, in, the, lower, range, significant, movement, of, the, slide, is, required, between, positions, which, becomes, more, exaggerated, on, lower, pitched, trombones, but, for, higher, notes, the, player, need, only, use, the, first, four, positions, of, the, slide, since, the, partials, are, closer, together, allowing, higher, notes, in, alternate, positions, as, an, example, f, 4, at, the, bottom, of, the, treble, clef, may, be, played, in, first, fourth, or, sixth, position, on, a, b, trombone, the, note, e, 1, or, the, lowest, e, on, a, standard, 88, key, piano, keyboard, is, the, lowest, attainable, note, on, a, 9, foot, 2, 7, m, b, tenor, trombone, requiring, a, full, 7, feet, 4, inches, 2, 24, m, of, tubing, on, trombones, without, an, f, attachment, there, is, a, gap, between, b, 1, the, fundamental, in, first, position, and, e, 2, the, first, harmonic, in, seventh, position, skilled, players, can, produce, falset, notes, between, these, but, the, sound, is, relatively, weak, and, not, usually, used, in, performance, the, addition, of, an, f, attachment, allows, for, intermediate, notes, to, be, played, with, more, clarity, the, b, pedal, tone, is, frequently, seen, in, commercial, scoring, but, much, less, often, in, symphonic, music, while, notes, below, that, are, called, for, only, rarely, as, they, become, increasingly, difficult, to, produce, and, insecure, in, quality, with, a, or, g, being, the, bottom, limit, for, most, tenor, trombonists, the, trombone, s, tubing, is, largely, cylindrical, which, inhibits, the, production, of, the, fundamental, as, a, pedal, tone, pitch, instead, trombonists, use, the, higher, harmonics, of, the, instrument, to, produce, pedal, tones, giving, them, a, bright, and, hollow, tone, quality, some, contemporary, orchestral, writing, movie, or, video, game, scoring, trombone, ensemble, and, solo, works, will, call, for, notes, as, low, as, a, pedal, c, b, or, even, double, pedal, b, on, the, bass, trombone, the, trombone, is, one, of, the, few, wind, instruments, that, can, produce, a, true, glissando, by, moving, the, slide, without, interrupting, the, airflow, or, sound, production, every, pitch, in, a, glissando, must, have, the, same, harmonic, number, and, a, tritone, is, the, largest, interval, that, can, be, performed, as, a, glissando, 151, the, trombone, glissando, can, create, remarkable, effects, and, it, is, used, in, jazz, and, popular, music, as, in, the, famous, song, the, stripper, by, david, rose, and, his, orchestra, harmonic, inverted, broken, or, false, glissandos, are, those, that, cross, one, or, more, harmonic, series, requiring, a, simulated, or, faked, glissando, effect, trills, though, generally, simple, with, valves, are, difficult, on, the, slide, trombone, trills, tend, to, be, easiest, and, most, effective, higher, in, the, harmonic, series, because, the, distance, between, notes, is, much, smaller, and, slide, movement, is, minimal, for, example, a, trill, on, b, 3, c, 4, is, virtually, impossible, as, the, slide, must, move, two, positions, either, 1st, to, 3rd, or, 5th, to, 3rd, however, at, an, octave, higher, b, 4, c, 5, the, notes, can, both, be, achieved, in, 1st, position, as, a, lip, trill, thus, the, most, convincing, trills, tend, to, be, above, the, first, octave, and, a, half, of, the, tenor, s, range, trills, are, most, commonly, found, in, early, baroque, and, classical, music, for, the, trombone, as, a, means, of, ornamentation, however, some, more, modern, pieces, will, call, for, trills, as, well, unlike, most, other, brass, instruments, in, an, orchestral, setting, the, trombone, is, not, usually, considered, a, transposing, instrument, prior, to, the, invention, of, valve, systems, most, brass, instruments, were, limited, to, playing, one, overtone, series, at, a, time, altering, the, pitch, of, the, instrument, required, manually, replacing, a, section, of, tubing, called, a, crook, or, picking, up, an, instrument, of, different, length, their, parts, were, transposed, according, to, which, crook, or, length, of, instrument, they, used, at, any, given, time, so, that, a, particular, note, on, the, staff, always, corresponded, to, a, particular, partial, on, the, instrument, trombones, on, the, other, hand, have, used, slides, since, their, inception, as, such, they, have, always, been, fully, chromatic, so, no, such, tradition, took, hold, and, trombone, parts, have, always, been, notated, at, concert, pitch, with, one, exception, discussed, below, also, it, was, quite, common, for, trombones, to, double, choir, parts, reading, in, concert, pitch, meant, there, was, no, need, for, dedicated, trombone, parts, note, that, while, the, fundamental, sounding, pitch, slide, fully, retracted, has, remained, quite, consistent, the, conceptual, pitch, of, trombones, has, changed, since, their, origin, e, g, baroque, a, tenor,
