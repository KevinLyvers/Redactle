muhammad, according, to, islam, the, kaaba, was, rebuilt, several, times, throughout, history, most, famously, by, ibrahim, and, his, son, ismail, when, he, returned, to, the, valley, of, mecca, several, years, after, leaving, his, wife, hajar, hagar, and, ismail, there, upon, allah, s, command, circling, the, kaaba, seven, times, counterclockwise, known, as, tawaf, arabic, romanized, tawaaf,

according, to, historian, eduard, glaser, the, name, kaaba, may, have, been, related, to, the, southern, arabian, or, ethiopian, word, mikrab, signifying, a, temple, author, patricia, crone, disputes, this, etymology, historian, patricia, crone, has, cast, doubt, on, the, claim, that, mecca, was, a, major, historical, trading, outpost, other, scholars, such, as, glen, bowersock, disagree, and, assert, that, it, was, crone, later, on, disregarded, some, of, her, theories, she, argues, that, meccan, trade, relied, on, skins, hides, manufactured, leather, goods, clarified, butter, hijazi, woollens, and, camels, she, suggests, that, most, of, these, goods, were, destined, for, the, roman, army, which, is, known, to, have, required, colossal, quantities, of, leather, and, hides, for, its, equipment, according, to, islamic, cosmology, the, zurah, pilgrimage, site, was, the, precursor, to, the, kaaba, prior, to, islam, the, kaaba, was, a, holy, site, for, the, various, bedouin, tribes, throughout, the, arabian, peninsula, once, every, lunar, year, bedouin, people, would, make, a, pilgrimage, to, mecca, setting, aside, any, tribal, feuds, they, would, worship, their, gods, in, the, kaaba, and, trade, with, each, other, in, the, city, various, sculptures, and, paintings, were, held, inside, the, kaaba, a, statue, of, hubal, the, principal, idol, of, mecca, and, statues, of, other, pagan, deities, are, known, to, have, been, placed, in, or, around, the, kaaba, apart, from, the, paintings, of, pagan, idols, decorating, the, walls, which, were, destroyed, at, the, behest, of, muhammad, after, his, conquest, of, mecca, there, were, also, paintings, of, angels, of, ibrahim, holding, divination, arrows, and, of, isa, jesus, and, his, mother, maryam, mary, which, muhammad, spared, undefined, decorations, money, and, a, pair, of, ram, s, horns, were, recorded, to, be, inside, the, kaaba, the, pair, of, ram, s, horns, were, said, to, have, belonged, to, the, ram, sacrificed, by, ibrahim, in, place, of, his, son, ismail, as, held, by, islamic, tradition, during, its, history, the, black, stone, at, the, kaaba, has, been, struck, and, smashed, by, a, stone, fired, from, a, catapult, it, has, been, smeared, with, excrement, stolen, and, ransomed, by, the, qarmatians, and, smashed, into, several, fragments, al, azraqi, provides, the, following, narrative, on, the, authority, of, his, grandfather, i, have, heard, that, there, was, set, up, in, al, bayt, referring, to, the, kaaba, a, picture, arabic, romanized, timthal, lit, depiction, of, maryam, and, isa, said, yes, there, was, set, in, it, a, picture, of, maryam, adorned, muzawwaqan, in, her, lap, her, son, isa, sat, adorned, in, her, book, islam, a, short, history, karen, armstrong, asserts, that, the, kaaba, was, officially, dedicated, to, hubal, a, nabatean, deity, and, contained, 360, idols, which, probably, represented, the, days, of, the, year, however, by, the, time, of, muhammad, s, era, it, seems, that, the, kaaba, was, venerated, as, the, temple, of, allah, the, high, god, once, a, year, tribes, from, all, around, the, arabian, peninsula, would, converge, on, mecca, to, perform, the, hajj, pilgrimage, which, was, a, mark, of, the, widespread, conviction, that, allah, was, the, same, deity, worshipped, by, monotheists, at, this, time, the, muslims, would, perform, the, salat, prayer, facing, jerusalem, as, instructed, by, muhammad, and, turning, their, backs, on, the, pagan, associations, of, the, kabah, alfred, guillaume, in, his, translation, of, the, ibn, ishaq, s, seerah, says, that, the, kaaba, itself, might, be, referred, to, in, the, feminine, form, circumambulation, was, often, performed, naked, by, men, and, almost, naked, by, women, it, is, disputed, whether, allah, and, hubal, were, the, same, deity, or, different, according, to, a, hypothesis, by, uri, rubin, and, christian, robin, hubal, was, only, venerated, by, quraysh, and, the, kaaba, was, first, dedicated, to, allah, a, supreme, god, of, individuals, belonging, to, different, tribes, while, the, pantheon, of, the, gods, of, quraysh, was, installed, in, the, kaaba, after, they, conquered, mecca, a, century, before, muhammad, s, time, imoti, contends, that, there, were, numerous, such, kaaba, sanctuaries, in, arabia, at, one, time, but, this, was, the, only, one, built, of, stone, the, others, also, allegedly, had, counterparts, of, the, black, stone, there, was, a, red, stone, in, the, kaaba, of, the, south, arabian, city, of, ghaiman, and, the, white, stone, in, the, kaaba, of, al, abalat, near, modern, day, tabala, grunebaum, in, classical, islam, points, out, that, the, experience, of, divinity, of, that, period, was, often, associated, with, the, fetishism, of, stones, mountains, special, rock, formations, or, trees, of, strange, growth, armstrong, further, says, that, the, kaaba, was, thought, to, be, at, the, center, of, the, world, with, the, gate, of, heaven, directly, above, it, the, kaaba, marked, the, location, where, the, sacred, world, intersected, with, the, profane, the, embedded, black, stone, was, a, further, symbol, of, this, as, a, meteorite, that, had, fallen, from, the, sky, and, linked, heaven, and, earth, according, to, sarwar, about, 400, years, before, the, birth, of, muhammad, a, man, named, amr, bin, luhayy, who, descended, from, qahtan, and, was, the, king, of, hijaz, placed, an, idol, of, hubal, on, the, roof, of, the, kaaba, this, idol, was, one, of, the, chief, deities, of, the, ruling, quraysh, tribe, the, idol, was, made, of, red, agate, and, shaped, like, a, human, but, with, the, right, hand, broken, off, and, replaced, with, a, golden, hand, when, the, idol, was, moved, inside, the, kaaba, it, had, seven, arrows, in, front, of, it, which, were, used, for, divination, to, maintain, peace, among, the, perpetually, warring, tribes, mecca, was, declared, a, sanctuary, where, no, violence, was, allowed, within, 30, km, 20, mi, of, the, kaaba, this, combat, free, zone, allowed, mecca, to, thrive, not, only, as, a, place, of, pilgrimage, but, also, as, a, trading, center, in, samaritan, literature, the, samaritan, book, of, the, secrets, of, moses, asatir, states, that, ismail, and, his, eldest, son, nebaioth, built, the, kaaba, as, well, as, the, city, of, mecca, the, asatir, book, was, likely, compiled, in, the, 10th, century, ce, though, moses, gaster, suggested, in, 1927, that, it, was, written, no, later, than, the, second, half, of, the, 3rd, century, bce, the, qur, an, contains, several, verses, regarding, the, origin, of, the, kaaba, it, states, that, the, kaaba, was, the, first, house, of, worship, for, mankind, and, that, it, was, built, by, ibrahim, and, ismail, on, allah, s, instructions, verily, the, first, house, of, worship, appointed, for, mankind, was, that, at, bakkah, makkah, full, of, blessing, and, a, guidance, for, mankind, behold, we, gave, the, site, to, ibrahim, of, the, sacred, house, saying, associate, not, anything, in, worship, with, me, and, sanctify, my, house, for, those, who, compass, it, round, or, stand, up, or, bow, or, prostrate, themselves, therein, in, prayer, and, remember, ibrahim, and, ismail, raised, the, foundations, of, the, house, with, this, prayer, our, lord, accept, this, service, from, us, for, thou, art, the, all, hearing, the, all, knowing, ibn, kathir, in, his, famous, exegesis, tafsir, of, the, quran, mentions, two, interpretations, among, the, muslims, on, the, origin, of, the, kaaba, one, is, that, the, temple, was, a, place, of, worship, for, mala, ikah, angels, before, the, creation, of, man, later, a, house, of, worship, was, built, on, the, location, and, was, lost, during, the, flood, in, nuh, noah, s, time, and, was, finally, rebuilt, by, ibrahim, and, ismail, as, mentioned, later, in, the, quran, ibn, kathir, regarded, this, tradition, as, weak, and, preferred, instead, the, narration, by, ali, ibn, abi, talib, that, although, several, other, temples, might, have, preceded, the, kaaba, it, was, the, first, bayt, allah, house, of, god, dedicated, solely, to, him, built, by, his, instruction, and, sanctified, and, blessed, by, him, as, stated, in, quran, 22, 26, 29, a, hadith, in, sahih, al, bukhari, states, that, the, kaaba, was, the, first, masjid, on, earth, and, the, second, was, al, aqsa, in, jerusalem, abu, dhar, narrated, i, said, o, allah, s, apostle, which, mosque, was, first, built, on, the, surface, of, the, earth, he, said, al, masjid, ul, haram, in, mecca, i, said, which, was, built, next, he, replied, the, mosque, of, al, aqsa, in, jerusalem, i, said, what, was, the, period, of, construction, between, the, two, he, said, forty, years, he, added, wherever, you, may, be, and, the, prayer, time, becomes, due, perform, the, prayer, there, for, the, best, thing, is, to, do, so, i, e, to, offer, the, prayers, in, time, sahih, al, bukhari, volume, 4, book, 55, hadith, number, 585, while, abraham, was, building, the, kaaba, an, angel, brought, to, him, the, black, stone, which, he, placed, in, the, eastern, corner, of, the, structure, another, stone, was, the, maqam, ibrahim, the, station, of, abraham, where, abraham, stood, for, elevation, while, building, the, structure, the, black, stone, and, the, maqam, ibrahim, are, believed, by, muslims, to, be, the, only, remnant, of, the, original, structure, made, by, abraham, as, the, remaining, structure, had, to, be, demolished, and, rebuilt, several, times, over, history, for, its, maintenance, after, the, construction, was, complete, god, enjoined, the, descendants, of, ismail, to, perform, an, annual, pilgrimage, the, hajj, and, the, qurban, sacrifice, of, cattle, the, vicinity, of, the, temple, was, also, made, a, sanctuary, where, bloodshed, and, war, were, forbidden, according, to, islamic, tradition, over, the, millennia, after, ismail, s, death, his, progeny, and, the, local, tribes, who, settled, around, the, zamzam, well, gradually, turned, to, polytheism, and, idolatry, several, idols, were, placed, within, the, kaaba, representing, deities, of, different, aspects, of, nature, and, different, tribes, several, rituals, were, adopted, in, the, pilgrimage, including, doing, naked, circumambulation, a, king, named, tubba, is, considered, the, first, one, to, have, a, door, be, built, for, the, kaaba, according, to, sayings, recorded, in, al, azraqi, s, akhbar, makka, the, interpretation, that, pre, islamic, arabs, once, practiced, abrahamic, religions, is, supported, by, some, literary, evidence, being, the, prevalence, of, ishmael, whose, god, was, that, of, abraham, in, pre, islamic, arab, culture, writing, in, the, encyclopedia, of, islam, wensinck, identifies, mecca, with, a, place, called, macoraba, mentioned, by, ptolemy, g, e, von, grunebaum, states, mecca, is, mentioned, by, ptolemy, the, name, he, gives, it, allows, us, to, identify, it, as, a, south, arabian, foundation, created, around, a, sanctuary, in, meccan, trade, and, the, rise, of, islam, patricia, crone, argues, that, the, identification, of, macoraba, with, mecca, is, false, and, that, macoraba, was, a, town, in, southern, arabia, in, what, was, then, known, as, arabia, felix, a, recent, study, has, revisited, the, arguments, for, macoraba, and, found, them, unsatisfactory, based, on, an, earlier, report, by, agatharchides, of, cnidus, diodorus, siculus, mentions, a, temple, along, the, red, sea, coast, which, is, very, holy, and, exceedingly, revered, by, all, arabians, edward, gibbon, believed, that, this, was, the, kaaba, however, ian, d, morris, argues, that, gibbon, had, misread, the, source, diodorus, puts, the, temple, too, far, north, for, it, to, have, been, mecca, christian, church, father, arnobius, in, around, 300, ce, referred, to, an, unshapen, stone, worshiped, in, an, unspecified, location, in, arabia, this, short, nestorian, christian, origin, chronicle, written, no, later, than, the, 660s, ce, covers, the, history, up, to, the, arab, conquest, and, also, gives, an, interesting, note, on, arabian, geography, the, section, covering, the, geography, starts, with, a, speculation, about, the, origin, of, the, muslim, sanctuary, in, arabia, regarding, the, k, bta, kaaba, of, ibrahim, we, have, been, unable, to, discover, what, it, is, except, that, because, the, blessed, abraham, grew, rich, in, property, and, wanted, to, get, away, from, the, envy, of, the, canaanites, he, chose, to, live, in, the, distant, and, spacious, parts, of, the, desert, since, he, lived, in, tents, he, built, that, place, for, the, worship, of, god, and, for, the, offering, of, sacrifices, it, took, its, present, name, from, what, it, had, been, since, the, memory, of, the, place, was, preserved, with, the, generations, of, their, race, indeed, it, was, no, new, thing, for, the, arabs, to, worship, there, but, goes, back, to, antiquity, to, their, early, days, in, that, they, show, honor, to, the, father, of, the, head, of, their, people, this, is, an, early, record, from, the, rashidun, caliphate, of, a, christian, origin, that, explicitly, mentions, the, kaaba, and, confirms, the, idea, that, not, just, the, arabs, but, certain, christians, as, well, associated, the, site, with, ibrahim, in, the, seventh, century, this, is, the, second, dateable, text, mentioning, the, kaaba, first, being, some, verses, from, the, quran, saudi, archeologist, mohammed, almaghthawi, discovered, some, rock, inscriptions, mentioning, the, masjid, al, haram, and, the, kaaba, dating, back, to, the, first, and, second, centuries, of, islam, one, of, them, reads, as, follows, god, suffices, and, wrote, maysara, bin, ibrahim, servant, of, the, kaaba, khadim, al, kaaba, juan, cole, is, of, the, opinion, that, the, inscription, is, likely, from, the, second, century, a, h, c, 718, 815, ce, during, muhammad, s, lifetime, 570, 632, ce, the, kaaba, was, considered, a, holy, site, by, the, local, arabs, muhammad, took, part, in, the, reconstruction, of, the, kaaba, around, 600, c, e, after, its, structure, was, weakened, by, a, fire, and, then, damaged, by, a, subsequent, flood, sources, including, ibn, ishaq, s, sirat, ras, l, all, h, one, of, the, biographies, of, muhammad, as, reconstructed, and, translated, by, guillaume, as, well, as, al, azraqi, s, chronicle, of, mecca, describe, muhammad, settling, a, quarrel, between, the, meccan, clans, as, to, which, clan, should, set, the, black, stone, in, its, place, according, to, ishaq, s, biography, muhammad, s, solution, was, to, have, all, the, clan, elders, raise, the, cornerstone, on, a, cloak, after, which, muhammad, set, the, stone, into, its, final, place, with, his, own, hands, the, timber, for, the, reconstruction, of, the, kaaba, was, purchased, by, quraysh, from, a, greek, ship, that, had, been, wrecked, on, the, red, sea, coast, at, shu, aybah, the, work, was, undertaken, by, a, greek, carpenter, from, the, same, ship, called, baqum, pachomius, financial, constraints, during, this, rebuilding, caused, quraysh, to, exclude, six, cubits, from, the, northern, part, of, the, kaaba, this, portion, is, what, is, currently, known, as, al, hateem, or, hijr, ismail, muhammad, s, isra, is, said, to, have, taken, him, from, the, kaaba, to, the, masjid, al, aqsa, and, heavenwards, from, there, muslims, initially, considered, jerusalem, as, their, qibla, or, prayer, direction, and, faced, toward, it, while, offering, prayers, however, pilgrimage, to, the, kaaba, was, considered, a, religious, duty, though, its, rites, were, not, yet, finalized, during, the, first, half, of, muhammad, s, time, as, a, prophet, while, he, was, at, mecca, he, and, his, followers, were, severely, persecuted, which, eventually, led, to, their, migration, to, medina, in, 622, ce, in, 624, ce, muslims, believe, the, direction, of, the, qibla, was, changed, from, the, masjid, al, aqsa, to, the, masjid, al, haram, in, mecca, with, the, revelation, of, surah, 2, verse, 144, in, 628, ce, muhammad, led, a, group, of, muslims, towards, mecca, with, the, intention, of, performing, the, umrah, but, was, prevented, from, doing, so, by, the, quraysh, he, secured, a, peace, treaty, with, them, the, treaty, of, hudaybiyyah, which, allowed, the, muslims, to, freely, perform, pilgrimage, at, the, kaaba, from, the, following, year, at, the, culmination, of, his, mission, in, 630, ce, after, the, allies, of, the, quraysh, the, banu, bakr, violated, the, treaty, of, hudaybiyyah, muhammad, conquered, mecca, his, first, action, was, to, remove, statues, and, images, from, the, kaaba, according, to, reports, collected, by, ibn, ishaq, and, al, azraqi, muhammad, spared, a, painting, of, mary, and, jesus, and, a, fresco, of, ibrahim, narrated, abdullah, when, the, prophet, entered, mecca, on, the, day, of, the, conquest, there, were, 360, idols, around, the, kaaba, the, prophet, started, striking, them, with, a, stick, he, had, in, his, hand, and, was, saying, truth, has, come, and, falsehood, has, vanished, qur, an, 17, 81, al, azraqi, further, conveys, how, muhammad, after, he, entered, the, kaaba, on, the, day, of, the, conquest, ordered, all, the, pictures, erased, except, that, of, maryam, shihab, said, that, the, prophet, peace, be, upon, him, entered, the, kaaba, on, the, day, of, the, conquest, and, in, it, was, a, picture, of, the, angels, mala, ika, among, others, and, he, saw, a, picture, of, ibrahim, and, he, said, may, allah, kill, those, representing, him, as, a, venerable, old, man, casting, arrows, in, divination, shaykhan, yastaqsim, bil, azlam, then, he, saw, the, picture, of, maryam, so, he, put, his, hands, on, it, and, he, said, erase, what, is, in, it, in, the, way, of, pictures, except, the, picture, of, maryam, after, the, conquest, muhammad, restated, the, sanctity, and, holiness, of, mecca, including, its, great, mosque, masjid, al, haram, in, islam, he, performed, the, hajj, in, 632, ce, called, the, hujjat, ul, wada, farewell, pilgrimage, since, muhammad, prophesied, his, impending, death, on, this, event, the, kaaba, has, been, repaired, and, reconstructed, many, times, the, structure, was, severely, damaged, by, a, fire, on, 3, rabi, i, 64, ah, sunday, 31, october, 683, ce, during, the, first, siege, of, mecca, in, 683, in, the, war, between, the, umayyads, and, abdullah, ibn, al, zubayr, an, early, muslim, who, ruled, mecca, for, many, years, between, the, death, of, ali, and, the, consolidation, of, power, by, the, umayyads, abdullah, rebuilt, it, to, include, the, hat, m, he, did, so, on, the, basis, of, a, tradition, found, in, several, hadith, collections, that, the, hat, m, was, a, remnant, of, the, foundations, of, the, abrahamic, kaaba, and, that, muhammad, himself, had, wished, to, rebuild, it, so, as, to, include, it, the, kaaba, was, bombarded, with, stones, in, the, second, siege, of, mecca, in, 692, in, which, the, umayyad, army, was, led, by, al, hajjaj, ibn, yusuf, the, fall, of, the, city, and, the, death, of, abdullah, ibn, al, zubayr, allowed, the, umayyads, under, abd, al, malik, ibn, marwan, to, finally, reunite, all, the, islamic, possessions, and, end, the, long, civil, war, in, 693, ce, abd, al, malik, had, the, remnants, of, al, zubayr, s, kaaba, razed, and, rebuilt, it, on, the, foundations, set, by, the, quraysh, the, kaaba, returned, to, the, cube, shape, it, had, taken, during, muhammad, s, time, its, basic, shape, and, structure, have, not, changed, since, then, during, the, hajj, of, 930, ce, the, shi, ite, qarmatians, attacked, mecca, under, abu, tahir, al, jannabi, defiled, the, zamzam, well, with, the, bodies, of, pilgrims, and, stole, the, black, stone, taking, it, to, the, oasis, in, eastern, arabia, known, as, al, a, s, where, it, remained, until, the, abbasids, ransomed, it, in, 952, ce, after, heavy, rains, and, flooding, in, 1626, the, walls, of, the, kaaba, collapsed, and, the, mosque, was, damaged, the, same, year, during, the, reign, of, ottoman, emperor, murad, iv, the, kaaba, was, rebuilt, with, granite, stones, from, mecca, and, the, mosque, was, renovated, in, 1916, after, hussein, bin, ali, had, launched, the, great, arab, revolt, during, the, battle, of, mecca, between, arab, and, ottoman, forces, the, ottoman, troops, bombarded, the, city, and, hit, the, kaaba, setting, fire, to, the, protective, veil, this, incident, was, later, exploited, by, the, propaganda, of, the, great, arab, revolt, to, attempt, to, demonstrate, the, impiety, of, the, ottomans, and, the, legitimacy, of, the, revolt, as, a,
