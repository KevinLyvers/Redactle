the, tale, of, genji, genji, monogatari, pronounced, also, known, as, genji, monogatari, is, a, classic, work, of, japanese, literature, written, by, the, noblewoman, poet, and, lady, in, waiting, murasaki, shikibu, around, the, peak, of, the, heian, period, in, the, early, 11th, century, the, original, manuscript, no, longer, exists, it, was, made, in, concertina, or, orihon, style, several, sheets, of, paper, pasted, together, and, folded, alternately, in, one, direction, then, the, other, the, work, is, a, unique, depiction, of, the, lifestyles, of, high, courtiers, during, the, heian, period, it, is, written, in, archaic, language, and, a, poetic, style, that, requires, specialized, study, in, the, early, 20th, century, genji, was, translated, into, modern, japanese, by, the, poet, akiko, yosano, the, first, english, translation, of, genji, was, made, in, 1882, by, suematsu, kencho, but, was, of, poor, quality, and, left, incomplete, since, then, complete, english, translations, have, been, made, by, arthur, waley, edward, seidensticker, royall, tyler, and, dennis, washburn, the, work, recounts, the, life, of, hikaru, genji, or, shining, genji, who, is, the, son, of, the, emperor, known, to, readers, as, emperor, kiritsubo, and, a, low, ranking, concubine, called, kiritsubo, consort, for, political, reasons, the, emperor, removes, genji, from, the, line, of, succession, demoting, him, to, commoner, status, by, giving, him, the, surname, minamoto, and, he, pursues, a, career, as, an, imperial, officer, the, tale, concentrates, on, genji, s, romantic, life, and, describes, the, customs, of, the, aristocratic, society, of, the, time, it, is, one, of, history, s, first, novels, the, first, by, a, woman, to, have, won, global, recognition, and, in, japan, today, has, a, stature, like, that, of, shakespeare, in, england, murasaki, lived, at, the, height, of, the, fujiwara, clan, s, power, fujiwara, no, michinaga, was, the, regent, in, all, but, name, and, the, most, significant, political, figure, of, his, day, consequently, murasaki, is, believed, to, have, formed, the, character, of, genji, partly, through, her, experience, of, michinaga, the, tale, of, genji, may, have, been, written, chapter, by, chapter, as, murasaki, delivered, installments, to, aristocratic, women, ladies, in, waiting, it, has, many, elements, found, in, a, modern, novel, a, central, character, and, a, large, number, of, major, and, minor, characters, well, developed, characterization, of, the, major, players, a, sequence, of, events, covering, the, central, character, s, lifetime, and, beyond, there, is, no, specified, plot, but, events, play, out, and, characters, grow, older, despite, a, dramatis, person, of, some, four, hundred, characters, it, maintains, internal, consistency, for, instance, all, characters, age, in, step, and, both, family, and, feudal, relationships, stay, intact, throughout, almost, none, of, the, characters, in, the, original, text, is, given, an, explicit, name, they, are, instead, referred, to, by, their, function, or, role, e, g, minister, of, the, left, an, honorific, e, g, his, excellency, or, their, relation, to, other, characters, e, g, heir, apparent, which, changes, as, the, novel, progresses, this, lack, of, names, stems, from, heian, era, court, manners, that, would, have, made, it, unacceptably, familiar, and, blunt, to, freely, mention, a, person, s, given, name, modern, readers, and, translators, have, used, various, nicknames, to, keep, track, of, the, many, characters, there, is, debate, over, how, much, of, genji, was, actually, written, by, murasaki, shikibu, debates, over, the, novel, s, authorship, have, gone, on, for, centuries, and, are, unlikely, to, ever, be, settled, unless, some, major, archival, discovery, is, made, it, is, generally, accepted, that, the, tale, was, finished, in, its, present, form, by, 1021, when, the, author, of, the, sarashina, nikki, wrote, a, diary, entry, about, her, joy, at, acquiring, a, complete, copy, of, the, tale, she, writes, that, there, are, over, 50, chapters, and, mentions, a, character, introduced, at, the, end, of, the, work, so, if, other, authors, besides, murasaki, did, work, on, the, tale, the, work, was, finished, very, near, to, the, time, of, her, writing, murasaki, s, own, diary, includes, a, reference, to, the, tale, and, indeed, the, application, to, herself, of, the, name, murasaki, in, an, allusion, to, the, main, female, character, that, entry, confirms, that, some, if, not, all, of, the, diary, was, available, in, 1008, when, internal, evidence, convincingly, suggests, that, the, entry, was, written, murasaki, is, said, to, have, written, the, character, of, genji, based, on, the, minister, on, the, left, at, the, time, she, was, at, court, other, translators, such, as, tyler, believe, the, character, murasaki, no, ue, whom, genji, marries, is, based, on, murasaki, shikibu, herself, yosano, akiko, who, made, the, first, modern, japanese, translation, of, genji, believed, that, murasaki, had, written, only, chapters, 1, to, 33, and, that, chapters, 35, to, 54, were, written, by, her, daughter, daini, no, sanmi, other, scholars, have, also, doubted, the, authorship, of, chapters, 42, to, 54, particularly, 44, which, contains, continuity, mistakes, in, the, rest, of, the, book, such, mistakes, are, rare, royall, tyler, writes, that, computer, analysis, has, turned, up, statistically, significant, discrepancies, of, style, between, chapters, 45, 54, and, the, rest, and, also, among, the, early, chapters, genji, s, mother, dies, when, he, is, three, years, old, and, the, emperor, cannot, forget, her, the, emperor, kiritsubo, then, hears, of, a, woman, lady, fujitsubo, formerly, a, princess, of, the, preceding, emperor, who, resembles, his, deceased, concubine, and, later, she, becomes, one, of, his, wives, genji, loves, her, first, as, a, stepmother, but, later, as, a, woman, and, they, fall, in, love, with, each, other, genji, is, frustrated, by, his, forbidden, love, for, the, lady, fujitsubo, and, is, on, bad, terms, with, his, own, wife, aoi, no, ue, the, lady, aoi, he, engages, in, a, series, of, love, affairs, with, many, other, women, these, are, however, unfulfilling, as, in, most, cases, his, advances, are, rebuffed, or, his, lover, dies, suddenly, or, he, becomes, bored, genji, visits, kitayama, a, rural, hilly, area, north, of, kyoto, where, he, finds, a, beautiful, ten, year, old, girl, he, is, fascinated, by, this, little, girl, murasaki, no, ue, and, discovers, that, she, is, a, niece, of, the, lady, fujitsubo, finally, he, kidnaps, her, brings, her, to, his, own, palace, and, educates, her, to, be, like, the, lady, fujitsubo, who, is, his, womanly, ideal, during, this, time, genji, also, meets, lady, fujitsubo, secretly, and, she, bears, his, son, reizei, everyone, except, the, two, lovers, believes, the, father, of, the, child, is, the, emperor, kiritsubo, later, the, boy, becomes, the, crown, prince, and, lady, fujitsubo, becomes, the, empress, but, genji, and, lady, fujitsubo, swear, to, keep, the, child, s, true, parentage, secret, genji, and, his, wife, lady, aoi, reconcile, she, gives, birth, to, a, son, but, dies, soon, after, genji, is, sorrowful, but, finds, consolation, in, murasaki, whom, he, marries, genji, s, father, the, emperor, kiritsubo, dies, he, is, succeeded, by, his, son, suzaku, whose, mother, kokiden, together, with, kiritsubo, s, political, enemies, take, power, in, the, court, then, another, of, genji, s, secret, love, affairs, is, exposed, genji, and, a, concubine, of, the, emperor, suzaku, are, discovered, while, meeting, in, secret, the, emperor, suzaku, confides, his, personal, amusement, at, genji, s, exploits, with, the, woman, oborozukiyo, but, is, duty, bound, to, punish, genji, even, though, he, is, his, half, brother, he, exiles, genji, to, the, town, of, suma, in, rural, harima, province, now, part, of, kobe, in, hy, go, prefecture, there, a, prosperous, man, known, as, the, akashi, novice, because, he, is, from, akashi, in, settsu, province, entertains, genji, and, genji, has, an, affair, with, akashi, s, daughter, she, gives, birth, to, genji, s, only, daughter, who, will, later, become, the, empress, in, the, capital, the, emperor, suzaku, is, troubled, by, dreams, of, his, late, father, kiritsubo, and, something, begins, to, affect, his, eyes, meanwhile, his, mother, kokiden, grows, ill, which, weakens, her, influence, over, the, throne, and, leads, to, the, emperor, ordering, genji, to, be, pardoned, genji, returns, to, kyoto, his, son, by, lady, fujitsubo, reizei, becomes, the, emperor, the, new, emperor, reizei, knows, genji, is, his, real, father, and, raises, genji, s, rank, to, the, highest, possible, however, when, genji, turns, 40, years, old, his, life, begins, to, decline, his, political, status, does, not, change, but, his, love, and, emotional, life, begin, to, incrementally, diminish, as, middle, age, takes, hold, he, marries, another, wife, the, third, princess, known, as, onna, san, no, miya, in, the, seidensticker, version, or, ny, san, in, waley, s, genji, s, nephew, kashiwagi, later, forces, himself, on, the, third, princess, and, she, bears, kaoru, who, in, a, similar, situation, to, that, of, reizei, is, legally, known, as, the, son, of, genji, genji, s, new, marriage, changes, his, relationship, with, murasaki, who, had, expressed, her, wish, of, becoming, a, nun, bikuni, though, the, wish, was, rejected, by, genji, genji, s, beloved, murasaki, dies, in, the, following, chapter, maboroshi, illusion, genji, contemplates, how, fleeting, life, is, the, next, chapter, is, titled, kumogakure, vanished, into, the, clouds, which, is, left, blank, but, implies, the, death, of, genji, chapter, 45, 54, are, known, as, the, uji, chapters, these, chapters, follow, kaoru, and, his, best, friend, niou, niou, is, an, imperial, prince, the, son, of, genji, s, daughter, the, current, empress, now, that, reizei, has, abdicated, the, throne, while, kaoru, is, known, to, the, world, as, genji, s, son, but, is, in, fact, fathered, by, genji, s, nephew, the, chapters, involve, kaoru, and, niou, s, rivalry, over, several, daughters, of, an, imperial, prince, who, lives, in, uji, a, place, some, distance, away, from, the, capital, the, tale, ends, abruptly, with, kaoru, wondering, if, niou, is, hiding, kaoru, s, former, lover, away, from, him, kaoru, has, sometimes, been, called, the, first, anti, hero, in, literature, the, tale, has, an, abrupt, ending, opinions, vary, on, whether, this, was, intended, by, the, author, arthur, waley, who, made, the, first, english, translation, of, the, whole, of, the, tale, of, genji, believed, that, the, work, as, we, have, it, was, finished, ivan, morris, however, author, of, the, world, of, the, shining, prince, believed, that, it, was, not, complete, and, that, later, chapters, were, missing, edward, seidensticker, who, made, the, second, translation, of, the, genji, believed, that, murasaki, shikibu, had, not, had, a, planned, story, structure, with, an, ending, as, such, but, would, simply, have, continued, writing, as, long, as, she, could, because, it, was, written, to, entertain, the, japanese, court, of, the, 11th, century, the, work, presents, many, difficulties, to, modern, readers, first, and, foremost, murasaki, s, language, heian, period, court, japanese, was, highly, inflected, and, had, very, complex, grammar, another, problem, is, that, almost, none, of, the, characters, are, named, within, the, work, instead, the, narrator, refers, to, men, often, by, their, rank, or, their, station, in, life, and, to, women, often, by, the, color, of, their, clothing, or, by, the, words, used, at, a, meeting, or, by, the, rank, of, a, prominent, male, relative, this, results, in, different, appellations, for, the, same, character, depending, on, the, chapter, another, aspect, of, the, language, is, the, importance, of, using, poetry, in, conversations, modifying, or, rephrasing, a, classic, poem, according, to, the, current, situation, was, expected, behavior, in, heian, court, life, and, often, served, to, communicate, thinly, veiled, allusions, the, poems, in, the, genji, are, often, in, the, classic, japanese, tanka, form, many, of, the, poems, were, well, known, to, the, intended, audience, so, usually, only, the, first, few, lines, are, given, and, the, reader, is, supposed, to, complete, the, thought, themselves, leaving, the, rest, which, the, reader, would, be, expected, to, know, unspoken, as, with, most, vernacular, literature, in, the, heian, period, genji, was, written, mostly, in, kana, japanese, phonetic, script, specifically, hiragana, and, not, in, kanji, writing, in, kanji, was, at, the, time, a, masculine, pursuit, women, were, generally, discreet, when, using, kanji, confining, themselves, mostly, to, native, japanese, words, yamato, kotoba, outside, of, vocabulary, related, to, politics, and, buddhism, genji, contains, remarkably, few, chinese, loan, words, kango, this, has, the, effect, of, giving, the, story, a, very, even, smooth, flow, however, it, also, introduces, confusion, there, are, a, number, of, homophones, words, with, the, same, pronunciation, but, different, meanings, and, for, modern, readers, context, is, not, always, sufficient, to, determine, which, meaning, was, intended, the, novel, is, traditionally, divided, into, three, parts, the, first, two, dealing, with, the, life, of, genji, and, the, last, with, the, early, years, of, two, of, genji, s, prominent, descendants, niou, and, kaoru, there, are, also, several, short, transitional, chapters, which, are, usually, grouped, separately, and, whose, authorships, are, sometimes, questioned, the, 54th, and, last, chapter, the, floating, bridge, of, dreams, is, sometimes, argued, by, modern, scholars, to, be, a, separate, part, from, the, uji, part, it, seems, to, continue, the, story, from, the, previous, chapters, but, has, an, unusually, abstract, chapter, title, it, is, the, only, chapter, whose, title, has, no, clear, reference, within, the, text, although, this, may, be, due, to, the, chapter, being, unfinished, this, question, is, made, more, difficult, by, the, fact, that, we, do, not, know, exactly, when, the, chapters, acquired, their, titles, the, english, translations, here, are, taken, from, the, arthur, waley, the, edward, seidensticker, the, royall, tyler, and, the, dennis, washburn, translations, it, is, not, known, for, certain, when, the, chapters, acquired, their, titles, early, mentions, of, the, tale, refer, to, chapter, numbers, or, contain, alternate, titles, for, some, of, the, chapters, this, may, suggest, that, the, titles, were, added, later, the, titles, are, largely, derived, from, poetry, that, is, quoted, within, the, text, or, allusions, to, various, characters, the, additional, chapter, between, 41, and, 42, in, some, manuscripts, is, called, kumogakure, which, means, vanished, into, the, clouds, the, chapter, is, a, title, only, and, is, probably, intended, to, evoke, genji, s, death, some, scholars, have, posited, the, earlier, existence, of, a, chapter, between, 1, and, 2, which, would, have, introduced, some, characters, that, seem, to, appear, very, abruptly, in, the, book, as, it, stands, the, waley, translation, completely, omits, the, 38th, chapter, later, authors, have, composed, additional, chapters, most, often, either, between, 41, and, 42, or, after, the, end, the, original, manuscript, written, by, murasaki, shikibu, no, longer, exists, numerous, copies, totaling, around, 300, according, to, ikeda, kikan, exist, with, differences, between, each, it, is, thought, that, shikibu, often, went, back, and, edited, early, manuscripts, introducing, discrepancies, with, earlier, copies, the, various, manuscripts, are, classified, into, three, categories, in, the, 13th, century, two, major, attempts, by, minamoto, no, chikayuki, and, fujiwara, teika, were, made, to, edit, and, revise, the, differing, manuscripts, the, chikayuki, manuscript, is, known, as, the, kawachibon, edits, were, many, beginning, in, 1236, and, completing, in, 1255, the, teika, manuscript, is, known, as, the, aoby, shibon, its, edits, are, more, conservative, and, thought, to, better, represent, the, original, these, two, manuscripts, were, used, as, the, basis, for, many, future, copies, the, beppon, category, represents, all, other, manuscripts, not, belonging, to, either, kawachibon, or, aoby, shibon, this, includes, older, but, incomplete, manuscripts, mixed, manuscripts, derived, from, both, kawachibon, and, aoby, shibon, and, commentaries, on, march, 10, 2008, it, was, announced, that, a, late, kamakura, period, 1192, 1333, manuscript, had, been, found, in, kyoto, containing, the, sixth, chapter, suetsumuhana, the, manuscript, was, 65, pages, in, length, most, remaining, manuscripts, are, based, on, copies, of, the, teika, manuscript, which, introduced, revisions, in, the, original, this, manuscript, however, belongs, to, a, different, lineage, and, was, not, influenced, by, teika, professor, yamamoto, tokur, who, examined, the, manuscript, said, this, is, a, precious, discovery, as, kamakura, manuscripts, are, so, rare, professor, kat, y, suke, said, this, is, an, important, discovery, as, it, asserts, that, non, teika, manuscripts, were, being, read, during, the, kamakura, period, on, october, 29, 2008, konan, women, s, university, announced, that, a, mid, kamakura, period, manuscript, had, been, found, containing, the, 32nd, chapter, umegae, the, manuscript, was, recognized, as, the, oldest, extant, copy, of, this, chapter, dating, to, between, 1240, and, 1280, the, manuscript, considered, to, be, of, the, beppon, category, is, 74, pages, in, length, and, differs, from, aoby, shi, manuscripts, in, at, least, four, places, raising, the, possibility, that, the, contents, may, be, closer, to, the, undiscovered, murasaki, shikibu, original, manuscript, on, october, 9, 2019, it, was, announced, that, an, original, copy, of, teika, s, aoby, shibon, had, been, found, in, tokyo, at, the, home, of, the, current, head, of, the, okochi, matsudaira, clan, who, ran, the, yoshida, domain, the, manuscript, is, the, 5th, chapter, wakamurasaki, and, is, the, oldest, version, of, the, chapter, blue, ink, common, in, teika, s, manuscript, and, handwriting, analysis, confirmed, that, the, manuscript, was, written, by, teika, making, it, among, the, 5, original, versions, of, the, aoby, shibon, known, to, exist, numerous, illustrations, of, scenes, from, genji, have, been, produced, most, notably, a, 12th, century, scroll, the, genji, monogatari, emaki, containing, illustrated, scenes, from, genji, together, with, handwritten, s, gana, text, this, scroll, is, the, earliest, extant, example, of, a, japanese, picture, scroll, collected, illustrations, and, calligraphy, of, a, single, work, the, original, scroll, is, believed, to, have, comprised, 10, 20, rolls, and, covered, all, 54, chapters, the, extant, pieces, include, only, 19, illustrations, and, 65, pages, of, text, plus, nine, pages, of, fragments, this, is, estimated, at, 15, of, the, envisioned, original, the, tokugawa, art, museum, in, nagoya, has, three, of, the, scrolls, handed, down, in, the, owari, branch, of, the, tokugawa, clan, and, one, scroll, held, by, the, hachisuka, family, is, now, in, the, gotoh, museum, in, tokyo, the, scrolls, are, designated, national, treasures, of, japan, the, scrolls, are, so, fragile, that, they, normally, are, not, shown, in, public, the, original, scrolls, in, the, tokugawa, museum, were, shown, from, november, 21, to, november, 29, in, 2009, since, 2001, they, have, been, displayed, in, the, tokugawa, museum, annually, for, around, one, week, in, november, an, oversize, english, photoreproduction, and, translation, was, published, in, limited, edition, in, 1971, by, kodansha, international, other, notable, illustrated, scrolls, of, genji, are, by, tosa, mitsuoki, who, lived, from, 1617, to, 1691, his, paintings, are, closely, based, on, heian, style, from, the, existing, scrolls, from, the, 12th, century, and, are, fully, complete, the, tale, was, also, a, popular, theme, in, ukiyo, e, prints, from, the, edo, period, the, tale, of, genji, was, written, in, an, archaic, court, language, and, a, century, after, its, completion, it, was, difficult, to, read, without, specialized, study, annotated, and, illustrated, versions, existed, as, early, as, the, 12th, century, it, was, not, until, the, early, 20th, century, that, genji, was, translated, into, modern, japanese, by, the, poet, akiko, yosano, translations, into, modern, japanese, have, made, it, easier, to, read, though, changed, some, meaning, and, has, given, names, to, the, characters, usually, the, traditional, names, used, by, academics, this, gives, rise, to, anachronisms, for, instance, genji, s, first, wife, is, named, aoi, because, she, is, known, as, the, lady, of, the, aoi, chapter, in, which, she, dies, other, known, translations, were, done, by, the, novelists, jun, ichir, tanizaki, and, fumiko, enchi, because, of, the, cultural, differences, reading, an, annotated, version, of, the, genji, is, quite, common, even, among, japanese, readers, there, are, several, annotated, versions, by, novelists, including, seiko, tanabe, jakucho, setouchi, and, osamu, hashimoto, many, works, including, a, manga, series, and, different, television, dramas, are, derived, from, the, tale, of, genji, there, have, been, at, least, five, manga, adaptations, of, genji, a, manga, version, was, created, by, waki, yamato, asakiyumemishi, the, tale, of, genji, in, english, and, a, current, version, by, sugimura, yoshimitsu, is, in, progress, another, manga, genji, monogatari, by, miyako, maki, won, the, shogakukan, manga, award, in, 1989, the, first, partial, translation, of, genji, into, english, was, by, suematsu, kench, published, in, 1882, arthur, waley, published, a, six, volume, translation, of, all, but, one, chapter, with, the, first, volume, published, in, 1925, and, the, last, in, 1933, in, 1976, edward, seidensticker, published, the, first, complete, translation, into, english, made, using, a, self, consciously, stricter, approach, with, regards, to, content, if, not, form, the, english, translation, published, in, 2001, by, royall, tyler, aims, at, fidelity, in, content, and, form, to, the, original, text, the, major, translations, into, english, are, each, slightly, different, mirroring, the, personal, choices, of, the, translator, and, the, period, in, which, the, translation, was, made, each, version, has, its, merits, its, detractors, and, its, advocates, and, each, is, distinguished, by, the, name, of, the, translator, for, example, the, version, translated, by, arthur, waley, would, typically, be, referred, to, as, the, waley, genji, the, tale, of, genji, is, an, important, work, of, world, literature, jorge, luis, borges, is, among, the, modern, authors, who, have, cited, it, as, inspiration, he, said, of, it, the, tale, of, genji, as, translated, by, arthur, waley, is, written, with, an, almost, miraculous, naturalness, and, what, interests, us, is, not, the, exoticism, the, horrible, word, but, rather, the, human, passions, of, the, novel, such, interest, is, just, murasaki, s, work, is, what, one, would, quite, precisely, call, a, psychological, novel, i, dare, to, recommend, this, book, to, those, who, read, me, it, is, noted, for, its, internal, consistency, psychological, depiction, and, characterization, the, novelist, yasunari, kawabata, said, in, his, nobel, prize, acceptance, speech, the, tale, of, genji, in, particular, is, the, highest, pinnacle, of, japanese, literature, even, down, to, our, day, there, has, not, been, a, piece, of, fiction, to, compare, with, it, the, genji, is, also, often, referred, to, as, the, first, novel, though, there, is, considerable, debate, over, this, other, texts, that, predate, genji, such, as, the, 7th, century, sanskrit, k, dambari, or, the, greek, and, roman, novels, from, classical, antiquity, such, as, daphnis, and, chloe, and, the, satyricon, are, considered, to, be, novels, and, there, is, debate,
