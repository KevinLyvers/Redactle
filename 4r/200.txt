had, suggested, to, him, that, this, might, be, a, suitably, down, to, earth, subject, for, a, novel, and, that, flaubert, should, attempt, to, write, in, a, natural, way, without, digressions, the, writing, style, was, of, supreme, importance, to, flaubert, while, writing, the, novel, he, wrote, that, it, would, be, a, book, about, nothing, a, book, dependent, on, nothing, external, which, would, be, held, together, by, the, internal, strength, of, its, style, an, aim, which, for, the, critic, jean, rousset, made, flaubert, the, first, in, date, of, the, non, figurative, novelists, such, as, james, joyce, and, virginia, woolf, though, flaubert, avowed, no, liking, for, the, style, of, balzac, the, novel, he, produced, became, arguably, a, prime, example, and, an, enhancement, of, literary, realism, in, the, vein, of, balzac, the, realism, in, the, novel, was, to, prove, an, important, element, in, the, trial, for, obscenity, the, lead, prosecutor, argued, that, not, only, was, the, novel, immoral, but, that, realism, in, literature, was, an, offence, against, art, and, decency, the, realist, movement, was, in, part, a, reaction, against, romanticism, emma, may, be, said, to, be, the, embodiment, of, a, romantic, in, her, mental, and, emotional, process, she, has, no, relation, to, the, realities, of, her, world, although, in, some, ways, he, may, seem, to, identify, with, emma, flaubert, frequently, mocks, her, romantic, daydreaming, and, taste, in, literature, the, accuracy, of, flaubert, s, supposed, assertion, that, madame, bovary, c, est, moi, madame, bovary, is, me, has, been, questioned, in, his, letters, he, distanced, himself, from, the, sentiments, in, the, novel, to, edma, roger, des, genettes, he, wrote, tout, ce, que, j, aime, n, y, est, pas, all, that, i, love, is, not, there, and, to, marie, sophie, leroyer, de, chantepie, je, n, y, ai, rien, mis, ni, de, mes, sentiments, ni, de, mon, existence, i, have, used, nothing, of, my, feelings, or, of, my, life, for, mario, vargas, llosa, if, emma, bovary, had, not, read, all, those, novels, it, is, possible, that, her, fate, might, have, been, different, madame, bovary, has, been, seen, as, a, commentary, on, the, bourgeoisie, the, folly, of, aspirations, that, can, never, be, realized, or, a, belief, in, the, validity, of, a, self, satisfied, deluded, personal, culture, associated, with, flaubert, s, period, especially, during, the, reign, of, louis, philippe, when, the, middle, class, grew, to, become, more, identifiable, in, contrast, to, the, working, class, and, the, nobility, flaubert, despised, the, bourgeoisie, in, his, dictionary, of, received, ideas, the, bourgeoisie, is, characterized, by, intellectual, and, spiritual, superficiality, raw, ambition, shallow, culture, a, love, of, material, things, greed, and, above, all, a, mindless, parroting, of, sentiments, and, beliefs, for, vargas, llosa, emma, s, drama, is, the, gap, between, illusion, and, reality, the, distance, between, desire, and, its, fulfillment, and, shows, the, first, signs, of, alienation, that, a, century, later, will, take, hold, of, men, and, women, in, industrial, societies, long, established, as, one, of, the, greatest, novels, the, book, has, been, described, as, a, perfect, work, of, fiction, henry, james, wrote, madame, bovary, has, a, perfection, that, not, only, stamps, it, but, that, makes, it, stand, almost, alone, it, holds, itself, with, such, a, supreme, unapproachable, assurance, as, both, excites, and, defies, judgment, marcel, proust, praised, the, grammatical, purity, of, flaubert, s, style, while, vladimir, nabokov, said, that, stylistically, it, is, prose, doing, what, poetry, is, supposed, to, do, similarly, in, his, preface, to, his, novel, the, joke, milan, kundera, wrote, not, until, the, work, of, flaubert, did, prose, lose, the, stigma, of, aesthetic, inferiority, ever, since, madame, bovary, the, art, of, the, novel, has, been, considered, equal, to, the, art, of, poetry, giorgio, de, chirico, said, that, in, his, opinion, from, the, narrative, point, of, view, the, most, perfect, book, is, madame, bovary, by, flaubert, julian, barnes, called, it, the, best, novel, that, has, ever, been, written, the, novel, exemplifies, the, tendency, of, realism, over, the, course, of, the, nineteenth, century, to, become, increasingly, psychological, concerned, with, the, accurate, representation, of, thoughts, and, emotions, rather, than, of, external, things, thus, it, prefigures, the, work, of, modernist, novelists, marcel, proust, virginia, woolf, and, james, joyce, the, book, was, controversial, upon, its, release, its, scandalous, subject, matter, led, to, an, obscenity, trial, in, 1857, flaubert, was, acquitted, le, figaro, was, negative, of, the, work, they, stated, monsieur, flaubert, is, not, a, writer, madame, bovary, has, had, the, following, film, and, television, adaptations, david, lean, s, film, ryan, s, daughter, 1970, was, a, loose, adaptation, of, the, story, relocating, it, to, ireland, during, the, time, of, the, easter, rebellion, the, script, had, begun, life, as, a, straight, adaptation, of, madame, bovary, but, lean, convinced, writer, robert, bolt, to, re, work, it, into, another, setting
