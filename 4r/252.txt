a, dictionary, of, the, english, language, sometimes, published, as, johnson, s, dictionary, was, published, on, 15, april, 1755, and, written, by, samuel, johnson, it, is, among, the, most, influential, dictionaries, in, the, history, of, the, english, language, there, was, dissatisfaction, with, the, dictionaries, of, the, period, so, in, june, 1746, a, group, of, london, booksellers, contracted, johnson, to, write, a, dictionary, for, the, sum, of, 1, 500, guineas, 1, 575, equivalent, to, about, 310, 000, in, 2024, johnson, took, seven, years, to, complete, the, work, although, he, had, claimed, he, could, finish, it, in, three, he, did, so, single, handedly, with, only, clerical, assistance, to, copy, the, illustrative, quotations, that, he, had, marked, in, books, johnson, produced, several, revised, editions, during, his, life, until, the, completion, of, the, oxford, english, dictionary, 173, years, later, johnson, s, was, viewed, as, the, pre, eminent, english, dictionary, according, to, walter, jackson, bate, the, dictionary, easily, ranks, as, one, of, the, greatest, single, achievements, of, scholarship, and, probably, the, greatest, ever, performed, by, one, individual, who, laboured, under, anything, like, the, disadvantages, in, a, comparable, length, of, time, in, earlier, times, books, had, been, regarded, with, something, approaching, veneration, but, by, the, mid, eighteenth, century, this, was, no, longer, the, case, the, rise, of, literacy, among, the, general, public, combined, with, the, technical, advances, in, the, mechanics, of, printing, and, bookbinding, meant, that, for, the, first, time, books, texts, maps, pamphlets, and, newspapers, were, widely, available, to, the, general, public, at, a, reasonable, cost, such, an, explosion, of, the, printed, word, demanded, a, set, pattern, of, grammar, definition, and, spelling, for, those, words, this, could, be, achieved, by, means, of, an, authoritative, dictionary, of, the, english, language, in, 1746, a, consortium, of, london, s, most, successful, printers, including, robert, dodsley, and, thomas, longman, none, could, afford, to, undertake, it, alone, set, out, to, satisfy, and, capitalise, on, this, need, by, the, ever, increasing, reading, and, writing, public, johnson, s, dictionary, was, not, the, first, english, dictionary, nor, even, among, the, first, dozen, over, the, previous, 150, years, more, than, twenty, dictionaries, had, been, published, in, england, the, oldest, of, these, being, a, latin, english, wordbook, by, sir, thomas, elyot, published, in, 1538, the, next, to, appear, was, by, richard, mulcaster, a, headmaster, in, 1583, mulcaster, compiled, what, he, termed, a, generall, table, we, commonlie, use, it, were, a, thing, verie, praise, worthy, if, som, well, learned, would, gather, all, words, which, we, use, in, the, english, tung, into, one, dictionary, in, 1598, an, italian, english, dictionary, by, john, florio, was, published, it, was, the, first, english, dictionary, to, use, quotations, illustrations, to, give, meaning, to, the, word, in, none, of, these, dictionaries, so, far, were, there, any, actual, definitions, of, words, this, was, to, change, to, a, small, extent, in, schoolmaster, robert, cawdrey, s, table, alphabeticall, published, in, 1604, though, it, contained, only, 2, 449, words, and, no, word, beginning, with, the, letters, w, x, or, y, this, was, the, first, monolingual, english, dictionary, several, more, dictionaries, followed, in, latin, english, french, and, italian, benjamin, martin, s, lingua, britannica, reformata, 1749, and, ainsworth, s, thesaurus, linguae, latinae, 1737, are, both, significant, in, that, they, define, entries, in, separate, senses, or, aspects, of, the, word, in, english, among, others, john, cowell, s, interpreter, a, law, dictionary, was, published, in, 1607, edward, phillips, the, new, world, of, english, words, came, out, in, 1658, and, a, dictionary, of, 40, 000, words, had, been, prepared, in, 1721, by, nathan, bailey, though, none, was, as, comprehensive, in, breadth, or, style, as, johnson, s, the, problem, with, these, dictionaries, was, that, they, tended, to, be, little, more, than, poorly, organised, and, poorly, researched, glossaries, of, hard, words, words, that, were, technical, foreign, obscure, or, antiquated, but, perhaps, the, greatest, single, fault, of, these, early, lexicographers, was, as, historian, henry, hitchings, put, it, that, they, failed, to, give, sufficient, sense, of, language, as, it, appeared, in, use, in, that, sense, dr, johnson, s, dictionary, was, the, first, to, comprehensively, document, the, english, lexicon, johnson, s, dictionary, was, prepared, at, 17, gough, square, london, an, eclectic, household, between, the, years, of, 1746, and, 1755, by, 1747, johnson, had, written, his, plan, of, a, dictionary, of, the, english, language, which, spelled, out, his, intentions, and, proposed, methodology, for, preparing, his, document, he, clearly, saw, benefit, in, drawing, from, previous, efforts, and, saw, the, process, as, a, parallel, to, legal, precedent, possibly, influenced, by, cowell, i, shall, therefore, since, the, rules, of, stile, like, those, of, law, arise, from, precedents, often, repeated, collect, the, testimonies, of, both, sides, and, endeavour, to, discover, and, promulgate, the, decrees, of, custom, who, has, so, long, possessed, whether, by, right, or, by, usurpation, the, sovereignty, of, words, johnson, s, plan, received, the, patronage, of, philip, stanhope, 4th, earl, of, chesterfield, but, not, to, johnson, s, pleasure, chesterfield, did, not, care, about, praise, but, was, instead, interested, by, johnson, s, abilities, seven, years, after, first, meeting, johnson, to, discuss, the, work, chesterfield, wrote, two, anonymous, essays, in, the, world, that, recommended, the, dictionary, he, complained, that, the, english, language, was, lacking, structure, and, argued, we, must, have, recourse, to, the, old, roman, expedient, in, times, of, confusion, and, chose, a, dictator, upon, this, principle, i, give, my, vote, for, mr, johnson, to, fill, that, great, and, arduous, post, however, johnson, did, not, appreciate, the, tone, of, the, essay, and, he, felt, that, chesterfield, had, not, made, good, on, his, promise, to, be, the, work, s, patron, in, a, letter, johnson, explained, his, feelings, about, the, matter, seven, years, my, lord, have, now, past, since, i, waited, in, your, outward, rooms, or, was, repulsed, from, your, door, during, which, time, i, have, been, pushing, on, my, work, through, difficulties, of, which, it, is, useless, to, complain, and, have, brought, it, at, last, to, the, verge, of, publication, without, one, act, of, assistance, one, word, of, encouragement, or, one, smile, of, favour, such, treatment, i, did, not, expect, for, i, never, had, a, patron, before, is, not, a, patron, my, lord, one, who, looks, with, unconcern, on, a, man, struggling, for, life, in, the, water, and, when, he, has, reached, ground, encumbers, him, with, help, the, notice, which, you, have, been, pleased, to, take, of, my, labours, had, it, been, early, had, been, kind, but, it, has, been, delayed, till, i, am, indifferent, and, cannot, enjoy, it, till, i, am, solitary, and, cannot, impart, it, till, i, am, known, and, do, not, want, it, a, dictionary, of, the, english, language, was, somewhat, large, and, very, expensive, it, was, printed, in, folio, meaning, that, the, pages, were, 18, inches, 46, cm, tall, and, nearly, 20, inches, 51, cm, wide, the, paper, was, of, the, finest, quality, available, the, cost, of, which, ran, to, nearly, 1, 600, more, than, johnson, had, been, paid, to, write, the, book, johnson, himself, pronounced, the, book, vasta, mole, superbus, proud, in, its, great, bulk, no, bookseller, could, possibly, hope, to, print, this, book, without, help, outside, a, few, special, editions, of, the, bible, no, book, of, this, heft, and, size, had, ever, been, set, to, type, the, title, page, reads, dictionary, of, the, english, language, in, which, the, words, are, deduced, from, their, originals, and, illustrated, in, their, different, significations, by, examples, from, the, best, writers, to, which, are, prefixed, a, history, of, the, language, and, an, english, grammar, by, samuel, johnson, a, m, in, two, volumes, the, words, samuel, johnson, and, english, language, were, printed, in, red, the, rest, was, printed, in, black, the, preface, and, headings, were, set, in, 4, 6, mm, english, type, the, text, double, columned, was, set, in, 3, 5, mm, pica, this, first, edition, of, the, dictionary, contained, a, 42, 773, word, list, to, which, only, a, few, more, were, added, in, subsequent, editions, one, of, johnson, s, important, innovations, was, to, illustrate, the, meanings, of, his, words, by, literary, quotation, of, which, there, are, around, 114, 000, the, authors, most, frequently, cited, by, johnson, include, shakespeare, milton, and, dryden, for, example, furthermore, johnson, unlike, bailey, added, notes, on, a, word, s, usage, rather, than, being, merely, descriptive, unlike, most, modern, lexicographers, johnson, introduced, humour, or, prejudice, into, quite, a, number, of, his, definitions, among, the, best, known, are, a, couple, of, less, well, known, examples, are, he, included, whimsical, little, known, words, such, as, on, a, more, serious, level, johnson, s, work, showed, a, heretofore, unseen, meticulousness, unlike, all, the, proto, dictionaries, that, had, come, before, painstaking, care, went, into, the, completeness, when, it, came, not, only, to, illustrations, but, also, to, definitions, as, well, the, original, goal, was, to, publish, the, dictionary, in, two, folio, volumes, a, k, and, l, z, but, that, soon, proved, unwieldy, unprofitable, and, unrealistic, subsequent, printings, ran, to, four, volumes, even, these, formed, a, stack, 10, inches, 25, cm, tall, and, weighed, in, at, nearly, 21, pounds, 9, 5, kg, in, addition, to, the, sheer, physical, heft, of, johnson, s, dictionary, came, the, equally, hefty, price, 4, 10, equivalent, to, approximately, 883, in, 2024, so, discouraging, was, the, price, that, by, 1784, thirty, years, after, the, first, edition, was, published, when, the, dictionary, had, by, then, run, through, five, editions, only, about, 6, 000, copies, were, in, circulation, an, average, sale, of, 200, books, a, year, for, thirty, years, johnson, s, etymologies, would, be, considered, poor, by, modern, standards, and, he, gave, little, guide, to, pronunciation, one, example, being, cough, a, convulsion, of, the, lungs, vellicated, by, some, sharp, serosity, it, is, pronounced, coff, much, of, his, dictionary, was, prescriptivist, it, was, also, linguistically, conservative, advocating, traditional, spellings, such, as, publick, rather, than, the, simpler, spellings, that, would, be, favoured, 73, years, later, by, noah, webster, the, dictionary, is, in, alphabetical, order, according, to, the, eighteenth, century, english, alphabet, in, the, eighteenth, century, the, letters, i, and, j, were, considered, different, forms, of, the, same, letter, the, same, with, letters, u, and, v, as, a, result, in, johnson, s, dictionary, the, word, jargon, comes, before, the, word, idle, and, vagabond, comes, before, ultimate, in, spite, of, its, shortcomings, the, dictionary, was, far, and, away, the, best, of, its, day, its, scope, and, structure, were, carried, forward, in, dictionaries, that, followed, including, noah, webster, s, webster, s, dictionary, in, 1828, and, the, oxford, english, dictionary, later, in, the, same, century, from, the, beginning, there, was, universal, appreciation, not, only, of, the, content, of, the, dictionary, but, also, of, johnson, s, achievement, in, single, handedly, creating, it, when, boswell, came, to, this, part, of, johnson, s, life, more, than, three, decades, later, he, pronounced, that, the, world, contemplated, with, wonder, so, stupendous, a, work, achieved, by, one, man, while, other, countries, had, thought, such, undertakings, fit, only, for, whole, academies, the, dictionary, was, considered, from, the, moment, of, its, inception, to, be, johnson, s, and, from, the, time, of, its, completion, it, was, johnson, s, dictionary, his, book, and, his, property, his, monument, his, memorial, immediately, after, publication, the, dictionary, was, enthusiastically, written, up, in, important, periodicals, such, as, the, london, magazine, and, none, too, surprisingly, the, gentleman, s, magazine, in, the, latter, it, received, an, eight, page, notice, reviews, such, as, they, were, proved, generous, in, tone, of, the, less, positive, assessments, the, only, properly, judicious, one, came, from, adam, smith, in, the, pro, whig, edinburgh, review, he, wished, that, johnson, had, oftener, passed, his, own, censure, upon, those, words, which, are, not, of, approved, use, though, sometimes, to, be, met, with, in, authors, of, no, mean, name, furthermore, johnson, s, approach, was, not, sufficiently, grammatical, despite, the, dictionary, s, critical, acclaim, johnson, s, general, financial, situation, continued, in, its, dismal, fashion, for, some, years, after, 1755, the, image, of, johnson, racing, to, write, rasselas, to, pay, for, his, mother, s, funeral, romantic, hyperbole, though, it, is, conveys, the, precariousness, of, his, existence, almost, four, years, after, his, work, on, the, dictionary, was, done, his, financial, uncertainties, continued, he, gave, up, the, house, in, gough, square, in, march, 1759, probably, for, lack, of, funds, yet, just, as, johnson, was, plunging, into, another, trough, of, despondency, the, reputation, of, the, dictionary, at, last, brought, reward, in, july, 1762, johnson, was, granted, a, state, pension, of, 300, a, year, by, the, twenty, four, year, old, monarch, george, iii, the, pension, did, not, make, him, rich, but, it, ensured, he, would, no, longer, have, to, grub, around, for, the, odd, guinea, as, lexicography, developed, faults, were, found, with, johnson, s, work, from, an, early, stage, there, were, noisy, detractors, perhaps, the, loudest, of, them, was, john, horne, tooke, not, content, to, pronounce, it, imperfect, and, faulty, he, complained, that, it, was, one, of, the, most, idle, performances, ever, offered, to, the, public, that, its, author, possessed, not, one, single, requisite, for, the, undertaking, that, its, grammatical, and, historical, parts, were, most, truly, contemptible, performances, and, that, nearly, one, third, is, as, much, the, language, of, the, hottentots, as, of, the, english, horace, walpole, summed, up, for, the, unbelievers, when, he, pronounced, at, the, end, of, the, eighteenth, century, i, cannot, imagine, that, dr, johnson, s, reputation, will, be, very, lasting, his, dictionary, was, a, surprising, work, for, one, man, but, the, task, is, too, much, for, one, man, and, a, society, should, alone, pretend, to, publish, a, standard, dictionary, notwithstanding, walpole, s, reservations, the, admirers, out, numbered, the, detractors, and, the, reputation, of, the, dictionary, was, repeatedly, boosted, by, other, philologists, lexicographers, educationalists, and, word, detectives, johnson, s, dictionary, was, made, when, etymology, was, largely, based, on, guesswork, his, classical, leanings, led, him, to, prefer, spellings, that, pointed, to, latin, or, greek, sources, while, his, lack, of, sound, scholarship, prevented, him, from, detecting, their, frequent, errors, for, example, he, preferred, the, spelling, ache, over, ake, as, he, wrongly, thought, it, came, from, the, greek, achos, some, of, his, spelling, choices, were, also, inconsistent, while, retaining, the, latin, p, in, receipt, he, left, it, out, of, deceit, he, spelled, deign, one, way, and, disdain, another, he, spelled, uphill, but, downhil, muckhill, but, dunghil, instill, but, distil, inthrall, but, disenthral, boswell, relates, that, a, lady, once, asked, him, how, he, came, to, define, pastern, as, the, knee, of, a, horse, instead, of, making, an, elaborate, reply, as, she, expected, he, at, once, replied, ignorance, madam, pure, ignorance, on, the, same, page, boswell, notes, that, johnson, s, definition, of, network, any, thing, reticulated, or, decussated, at, equal, distances, with, interstices, between, the, intersections, has, often, been, quoted, with, sportive, malignity, as, obscuring, a, thing, in, itself, very, plain, other, than, stress, indication, the, dictionary, did, not, feature, many, word, specific, orthoepical, guidelines, with, johnson, stating, that, for, pronunciation, the, best, general, rule, is, to, consider, those, as, the, most, elegant, speakers, who, deviate, least, from, the, written, sounds, and, referring, to, the, irregular, pronunciations, as, jargon, this, was, subject, to, coetaneous, criticism, by, john, walker, who, wrote, in, the, preface, of, his, critical, pronouncing, dictionary, it, is, certain, where, custom, is, equal, this, ought, to, take, place, and, if, the, whole, body, of, respectable, english, speakers, were, equally, divided, in, thir, pronunciation, of, the, word, busy, one, half, pronuncing, it, bew, ze, and, the, other, half, biz, ze, that, the, former, ought, to, be, accounted, the, most, elegant, speakers, but, till, this, is, the, case, the, latter, pronunciation, though, a, gross, deviation, from, orthography, will, be, esteemed, the, most, elegant, dr, johnson, s, general, rule, therefore, can, only, take, place, where, custom, has, not, plainly, decided, nevertheless, walker, scrupulously, followed, johnson, s, explanations, of, words, as, did, many, contemporary, dictionaries, despite, the, criticisms, the, influence, of, the, dictionary, was, sweeping, johnson, established, both, a, methodology, for, how, dictionaries, should, be, put, together, and, a, paradigm, for, how, entries, should, be, presented, anyone, who, sought, to, create, a, dictionary, post, johnson, did, so, in, his, shadow, in, his, history, of, the, oxford, english, dictionary, simon, winchester, asserts, of, its, eighteenth, century, predecessor, that, by, the, end, of, the, century, every, educated, household, had, or, had, access, to, the, great, book, so, firmly, established, did, it, swiftly, become, that, any, request, for, the, dictionary, would, bring, forth, johnson, and, none, other, one, asked, for, the, dictionary, writes, winchester, much, as, one, might, demand, the, bible, one, of, the, first, editors, of, the, oed, james, murray, acknowledged, that, many, of, johnson, s, explanations, were, adopted, without, change, for, when, his, definitions, are, correct, and, his, arrangement, judicious, it, seems, to, be, expedient, to, follow, him, in, the, end, the, oed, reproduced, around, 1, 700, of, johnson, s, definitions, marking, them, simply, j, johnson, s, influence, was, not, confined, to, britain, and, english, the, president, of, the, florentine, accademia, declared, that, the, dictionary, would, be, a, perpetual, monument, of, fame, to, the, author, an, honour, to, his, own, country, in, particular, and, a, general, benefit, to, the, republic, of, letters, this, was, no, empty, commendation, johnson, s, work, served, as, a, model, for, lexicographers, abroad, it, is, no, surprise, that, his, friend, giuseppe, baretti, chose, to, make, the, dictionary, the, model, for, his, italian, english, dictionary, of, 1760, and, for, his, spanish, dictionary, nearly, two, decades, later, but, there, are, numerous, examples, of, influence, beyond, johnson, s, own, circle, his, work, was, translated, into, french, and, german, and, in, 1777, when, ferdinando, bottarelli, published, a, pocket, dictionary, of, italian, french, and, english, the, three, languages, side, by, side, his, authorities, for, the, french, and, italian, words, were, the, works, of, the, french, and, italian, academies, for, the, english, he, used, johnson, the, dictionary, was, exported, to, america, the, american, adoption, of, the, dictionary, was, a, momentous, event, not, just, in, its, history, but, in, the, history, of, lexicography, for, americans, in, the, second, half, of, the, eighteenth, century, johnson, was, the, seminal, authority, on, language, and, the, subsequent, development, of, american, lexicography, was, coloured, by, his, fame, for, american, lexicographers, the, dictionary, was, impossible, to, ignore, america, s, two, great, nineteenth, century, lexicographers, noah, webster, and, joseph, emerson, worcester, argued, fiercely, over, johnson, s, legacy, in, 1789, declared, that, great, britain, whose, children, we, are, and, whose, language, we, speak, should, no, longer, be, our, standard, for, the, taste, of, her, writers, is, already, corrupted, and, her, language, on, the, decline, where, webster, found, fault, with, johnson, joseph, worcester, saluted, him, in, 1846, he, completed, his, universal, and, critical, dictionary, of, the, english, language, he, defended, johnson, s, work, arguing, that, from, the, time, of, its, publication, has, been, far, more, than, any, other, regarded, as, the, standard, for, the, language, notwithstanding, the, evolution, of, lexicography, in, america, the, dictionary, has, also, played, its, part, in, the, law, especially, in, the, united, states, legislators, are, much, occupied, with, ascertaining, first, meanings, with, trying, to, secure, the, literal, sense, of, their, predecessors, legislation, often, it, is, a, matter, of, historicizing, language, to, understand, a, law, you, need, to, understand, what, its, terminology, meant, to, its, original, architects, as, long, as, the, american, constitution, remains, intact, johnson, s, dictionary, will, have, a, role, to, play, in, american, law, johnson, s, dictionary, came, out, in, two, forms, the, first, was, the, 1755, folio, edition, which, came, in, two, large, volumes, on, 4, april, the, folio, edition, also, features, full, literary, quotes, by, those, authors, that, johnson, quoted, such, as, dryden, and, shakespeare, it, was, followed, a, few, weeks, later, by, a, second, edition, published, in, 165, weekly, parts, the, third, edition, was, published, in, 1765, but, it, was, the, fourth, which, came, out, in, 1773, which, included, significant, revisions, by, johnson, of, the, original, work, the, abridged, edition, came, out, in, 1756, in, two, octavo, volumes, with, entries, abstracted, from, the, folio, edition, by, the, author, laid, out, as, two, columns, per, page, the, abridged, version, did, not, feature, the, literary, quotes, just, the, author, quoted, this, made, it, cheaper, to, produce, and, buy, it, sold, over, a, thousand, copies, a, year, for, the, next, 30, years, bringing,
