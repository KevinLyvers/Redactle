the, world, created, by, the, u, s, government, for, the, increase, and, diffusion, of, knowledge, founded, on, august, 10, 1846, it, operates, as, a, trust, instrumentality, and, is, not, formally, a, part, of, any, of, the, three, branches, of, the, federal, government, the, institution, is, named, after, its, founding, donor, british, scientist, james, smithson, it, was, originally, organized,

2021, the, institution, s, endowment, had, a, total, value, of, about, 5, 4, billion, in, many, ways, the, origin, of, the, smithsonian, institution, can, be, traced, to, a, group, of, washington, citizens, who, being, impressed, with, the, importance, of, forming, an, association, for, promoting, useful, knowledge, met, on, june, 28, 1816, to, establish, the, columbian, institute, for, the, promotion, of, arts, and, sciences, officers, were, elected, in, october, 1816, and, the, organization, was, granted, a, charter, by, congress, on, april, 20, 1818, this, charter, expired, in, 1838, benjamin, latrobe, who, was, architect, for, the, us, capitol, after, the, war, of, 1812, and, william, thornton, the, architect, who, designed, the, octagon, house, and, tudor, place, would, serve, as, officers, other, prominent, members, who, numbered, from, 30, to, 70, during, the, institute, s, existence, included, john, quincy, adams, andrew, jackson, henry, clay, judge, william, cranch, and, james, hoban, honorary, members, included, james, madison, james, monroe, john, adams, thomas, jefferson, and, the, marquis, de, lafayette, operating, expenses, were, covered, from, the, 5, yearly, dues, collected, from, each, member, the, institute, proposed, a, number, of, undertakings, these, included, the, study, of, plant, life, and, the, creation, of, a, botanical, garden, on, the, capitol, mall, an, examination, of, the, country, s, mineral, production, improvement, in, the, management, and, care, of, livestock, and, the, writing, of, a, topographical, and, statistical, history, of, the, united, states, reports, were, to, be, published, periodically, to, share, this, knowledge, with, the, greater, public, but, due, to, a, lack, of, funds, this, initially, did, not, occur, the, institute, first, met, in, blodget, s, hotel, later, in, the, treasury, department, and, city, hall, before, being, assigned, a, permanent, home, in, 1824, in, the, capitol, building, beginning, in, 1825, weekly, sittings, were, arranged, during, sessions, of, congress, for, the, reading, of, scientific, and, literary, productions, but, this, was, continued, for, only, a, short, time, as, the, number, attending, declined, rapidly, eighty, five, communications, by, 26, people, were, made, to, congress, during, the, entire, life, of, the, society, with, more, than, a, half, relating, to, astronomy, or, mathematics, among, all, the, activities, planned, by, the, institute, only, a, few, were, actually, implemented, two, were, the, establishment, of, a, botanical, garden, and, a, museum, that, was, designed, to, have, a, national, and, permanent, status, the, former, occupied, space, where, the, present, botanic, garden, sits, the, museum, contained, specimens, of, zoology, botany, archeology, fossils, etc, some, of, which, were, passed, on, to, the, smithsonian, institution, after, its, formation, the, institute, s, charter, expired, in, 1838, but, its, spirit, lived, on, in, the, national, institution, founded, in, 1840, with, the, mission, to, promote, science, and, the, useful, arts, and, to, establish, a, national, museum, of, natural, history, this, organization, continued, to, press, congress, to, establish, a, museum, that, would, be, structured, in, terms, that, were, very, similar, to, those, finally, incorporated, into, the, founding, of, the, smithsonian, institution, its, work, helped, to, develop, an, underlying, philosophy, that, pushed, for, the, pursuit, and, development, of, scientific, knowledge, that, would, benefit, the, nation, and, edify, its, citizens, at, the, same, time, the, british, scientist, james, smithson, 1765, 1829, left, most, of, his, wealth, to, his, nephew, henry, james, hungerford, when, hungerford, died, childless, in, 1835, the, estate, passed, to, the, united, states, of, america, to, found, at, washington, under, the, name, of, the, smithsonian, institution, an, establishment, for, the, increase, diffusion, of, knowledge, among, men, in, accordance, with, smithson, s, will, congress, officially, accepted, the, legacy, bequeathed, to, the, nation, and, pledged, the, faith, of, the, united, states, to, the, charitable, trust, on, july, 1, 1836, the, american, diplomat, richard, rush, was, dispatched, to, england, by, president, andrew, jackson, to, collect, the, bequest, rush, returned, in, august, 1838, with, 105, sacks, containing, 104, 960, gold, sovereigns, this, is, approximately, 500, 000, at, the, time, which, is, equivalent, to, 14, 000, 000, in, 2023, or, equivalent, to, 12, 000, 000, in, 2023, however, when, considering, the, gdp, at, the, time, it, may, be, more, comparable, to, 220, million, in, the, year, 2007, once, the, money, was, in, hand, eight, years, of, congressional, haggling, ensued, over, how, to, interpret, smithson, s, rather, vague, mandate, for, the, increase, and, diffusion, of, knowledge, the, money, was, invested, by, the, us, treasury, in, bonds, issued, by, the, state, of, arkansas, which, soon, defaulted, after, heated, debate, massachusetts, representative, and, former, president, john, quincy, adams, persuaded, congress, to, restore, the, lost, funds, with, interest, and, despite, designs, on, the, money, for, other, purposes, convinced, his, colleagues, to, preserve, it, for, an, institution, of, science, and, learning, finally, on, august, 10, 1846, president, james, k, polk, signed, the, legislation, that, established, the, smithsonian, institution, as, a, trust, instrumentality, of, the, united, states, to, be, administered, by, a, board, of, regents, and, a, secretary, of, the, smithsonian, though, the, smithsonian, s, first, secretary, joseph, henry, wanted, the, institution, to, be, a, center, for, scientific, research, it, also, became, the, depository, for, various, washington, and, u, s, government, collections, the, united, states, exploring, expedition, by, the, u, s, navy,
