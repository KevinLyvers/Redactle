https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canterbury_Tales
the, canterbury, tales, middle, english, tales, of, caunterbury, is, a, collection, of, twenty, four, stories, that, runs, to, over, 17, 000, lines, written, in, middle, english, by, geoffrey, chaucer, between, 1387, and, 1400, it, is, widely, regarded, as, chaucer, s, magnum, opus, the, tales, mostly, written, in, verse, although, some, are, in, prose, are, presented, as, part, of, a, story, telling, contest, by, a, group, of, pilgrims, as, they, travel, together, from, london, to, canterbury, to, visit, the, shrine, of, saint, thomas, becket, at, canterbury, cathedral, the, prize, for, this, contest, is, a, free, meal, at, the, tabard, inn, at, southwark, on, their, return, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, greatest, contribution, of, the, canterbury, tales, to, english, literature, was, the, popularisation, of, the, english, vernacular, in, mainstream, literature, as, opposed, to, french, italian, or, latin, english, had, however, been, used, as, a, literary, language, centuries, before, chaucer, s, time, and, several, of, chaucer, s, contemporaries, john, gower, william, langland, the, pearl, poet, and, julian, of, norwich, also, wrote, major, literary, works, in, english, it, is, unclear, to, what, extent, chaucer, was, seminal, in, this, evolution, of, literary, preference, the, canterbury, tales, is, generally, thought, to, have, been, incomplete, at, the, end, of, chaucer, s, life, in, the, general, prologue, some, 30, pilgrims, are, introduced, according, to, the, prologue, chaucer, s, intention, was, to, write, four, stories, from, the, perspective, of, each, pilgrim, two, each, on, the, way, to, and, from, their, ultimate, destination, st, thomas, becket, s, shrine, making, for, a, total, of, about, 120, stories, it, is, revered, as, one, of, the, most, important, works, in, english, literature, the, question, of, whether, the, canterbury, tales, is, a, finished, work, has, not, been, answered, to, date, there, are, 84, manuscripts, and, four, incunabula, printed, before, 1500, editions, of, the, work, which, is, more, than, for, any, other, vernacular, english, literary, text, with, the, exception, of, prick, of, conscience, this, comparison, should, not, be, taken, as, evidence, of, the, tales, popularity, in, the, century, after, chaucer, s, death, because, according, to, derek, pearsall, it, is, unfair, considering, that, prick, of, conscience, had, all, the, benefit, of, the, preservation, of, a, dogmatic, religious, subject, matter, fifty, five, of, these, manuscripts, are, thought, to, have, been, originally, complete, while, 28, are, so, fragmentary, that, it, is, difficult, to, ascertain, whether, they, were, copied, individually, or, as, part, of, a, set, the, tales, vary, in, both, minor, and, major, ways, from, manuscript, to, manuscript, many, of, the, minor, variations, are, due, to, copyists, errors, while, it, is, suggested, that, in, other, cases, chaucer, both, added, to, his, work, and, revised, it, as, it, was, being, copied, and, possibly, as, it, was, being, distributed, there, are, no, manuscripts, of, the, canterbury, tales, surviving, in, chaucer, s, own, hand, the, two, earliest, known, manuscripts, which, both, appear, to, have, been, copied, by, the, same, scribe, are, ms, peniarth, 392, d, called, hengwrt, and, the, ellesmere, manuscript, a, deluxe, illustrated, manuscript, until, the, 1940s, scholars, tended, to, prefer, the, ellesmere, manuscript, as, closer, to, chaucer, s, intentions, following, john, m, manly, and, edith, rickert, scholars, increasingly, favoured, hengwrt, the, first, version, of, the, canterbury, tales, to, be, published, in, print, was, william, caxton, s, 1476, edition, it, was, one, of, the, first, books, to, be, printed, by, caxton, the, first, person, in, england, to, print, books, using, a, printing, press, only, 10, copies, of, this, edition, are, known, to, exist, including, one, held, by, the, british, library, and, one, held, by, the, folger, shakespeare, library, the, copyist, of, the, hengwrt, and, ellesmere, manuscripts, has, been, identified, as, a, scrivener, named, adam, pinkhurst, since, a, poem, apparently, by, chaucer, identifies, his, scribe, as, a, man, named, adam, this, has, led, to, the, hypothesis, that, the, scribe, who, copied, these, two, important, manuscripts, worked, with, chaucer, and, knew, him, personally, this, identification, has, been, the, subject, of, much, controversy, in, the, field, of, middle, english, palaeography, though, it, is, widely, accepted, as, plausible, there, is, no, consensus, as, to, whether, a, complete, version, of, the, tales, exists, and, also, no, consensus, regarding, chaucer, s, intended, order, of, the, stories, textual, and, manuscript, clues, have, been, adduced, to, support, the, two, most, popular, modern, methods, of, ordering, the, tales, some, scholarly, editions, divide, the, tales, into, ten, fragments, the, tales, that, make, up, a, fragment, are, closely, related, and, contain, internal, indications, of, their, order, of, presentation, usually, with, one, character, speaking, to, and, then, stepping, aside, for, another, character, however, between, fragments, the, connection, is, less, obvious, consequently, there, are, several, possible, orders, the, one, most, frequently, seen, in, modern, editions, follows, the, numbering, of, the, fragments, ultimately, based, on, the, ellesmere, order, victorians, frequently, used, the, nine, groups, which, was, the, order, used, by, walter, william, skeat, whose, edition, chaucer, complete, works, was, used, by, oxford, university, press, for, most, of, the, twentieth, century, but, this, order, is, currently, seldom, followed, general, prologue, the, knight, s, tale, the, miller, s, tale, the, reeve, s, tale, the, cook, s, tale, an, alternative, ordering, seen, in, the, early, 15th, century, manuscript, harley, ms, 7334, places, fragment, viii, before, vi, fragments, i, and, ii, almost, always, follow, each, other, just, as, vi, and, vii, ix, and, x, do, in, the, oldest, manuscripts, fragments, iv, and, v, by, contrast, vary, in, location, from, manuscript, to, manuscript, chaucer, mainly, wrote, in, a, london, dialect, of, late, middle, english, which, has, clear, differences, from, modern, english, from, philological, research, some, facts, are, known, about, the, pronunciation, of, english, during, the, time, of, chaucer, chaucer, pronounced, e, at, the, end, of, many, words, so, that, care, except, when, followed, by, a, vowel, sound, was, not, k, r, as, in, modern, english, other, nowadays, silent, letters, were, also, pronounced, so, that, the, word, knight, was, with, both, the, k, and, the, gh, pronounced, not, n, a, t, in, some, cases, vowel, letters, in, middle, english, were, pronounced, very, differently, from, modern, english, because, the, great, vowel, shift, had, not, yet, happened, for, instance, the, long, e, in, wepyng, weeping, was, pronounced, as, as, in, modern, german, or, italian, not, as, i, below, is, an, ipa, transcription, of, the, opening, lines, of, the, merchant, s, prologue, no, manuscript, exists, in, chaucer, s, own, hand, all, extant, copies, were, made, by, scribes, because, the, final, e, sound, was, lost, soon, after, chaucer, s, time, scribes, did, not, accurately, copy, it, and, this, gave, scholars, the, impression, that, chaucer, himself, was, inconsistent, in, using, it, it, has, now, been, established, however, that, e, was, an, important, part, of, chaucer, s, grammar, and, helped, to, distinguish, singular, adjectives, from, plural, and, subjunctive, verbs, from, indicative, no, other, work, prior, to, chaucer, s, is, known, to, have, set, a, collection, of, tales, within, the, framework, of, pilgrims, on, a, pilgrimage, it, is, obvious, however, that, chaucer, borrowed, portions, sometimes, very, large, portions, of, his, stories, from, earlier, stories, and, that, his, work, was, influenced, by, the, general, state, of, the, literary, world, in, which, he, lived, storytelling, was, the, main, entertainment, in, england, at, the, time, and, storytelling, contests, had, been, around, for, hundreds, of, years, in, 14th, century, england, the, english, pui, was, a, group, with, an, appointed, leader, who, would, judge, the, songs, of, the, group, the, winner, received, a, crown, and, as, with, the, winner, of, the, canterbury, tales, a, free, dinner, it, was, common, for, pilgrims, on, a, pilgrimage, to, have, a, chosen, master, of, ceremonies, to, guide, them, and, organise, the, journey, harold, bloom, suggests, that, the, structure, is, mostly, original, but, inspired, by, the, pilgrim, figures, of, dante, and, virgil, in, the, divine, comedy, new, research, suggests, that, the, general, prologue, in, which, the, innkeeper, and, host, harry, bailey, introduces, each, pilgrim, is, a, pastiche, of, the, historical, harry, bailey, s, surviving, 1381, poll, tax, account, of, southwark, s, inhabitants, the, canterbury, tales, contains, more, parallels, to, the, decameron, by, giovanni, boccaccio, than, any, other, work, like, the, tales, the, decameron, features, a, frame, tale, in, which, several, different, narrators, tell, a, series, of, stories, in, the, decameron, the, characters, have, fled, to, the, countryside, to, escape, the, black, death, it, ends, with, an, apology, by, boccaccio, much, like, chaucer, s, retraction, to, the, tales, a, quarter, of, the, tales, in, the, canterbury, tales, parallel, a, tale, in, the, decameron, although, most, of, them, have, closer, parallels, in, other, stories, some, scholars, thus, find, it, unlikely, that, chaucer, had, a, copy, of, the, work, on, hand, surmising, instead, that, he, may, have, merely, read, the, decameron, at, some, point, chaucer, may, have, read, the, decameron, during, his, first, diplomatic, mission, to, italy, in, 1372, chaucer, used, a, wide, variety, of, sources, but, some, in, particular, were, used, frequently, over, several, tales, among, them, the, bible, classical, poetry, by, ovid, and, the, works, of, contemporary, italian, writers, petrarch, and, dante, chaucer, was, the, first, author, to, use, the, work, of, these, last, two, boethius, consolation, of, philosophy, appears, in, several, tales, as, do, the, works, of, john, gower, a, friend, of, chaucer, s, chaucer, also, seems, to, have, borrowed, from, numerous, religious, encyclopaedias, and, liturgical, writings, such, as, john, bromyard, s, summa, praedicantium, a, preacher, s, handbook, and, jerome, s, adversus, jovinianum, many, scholars, say, there, is, a, good, possibility, chaucer, met, petrarch, or, boccaccio, the, canterbury, tales, is, a, collection, of, stories, built, around, a, frame, tale, a, common, and, already, long, established, genre, in, this, period, chaucer, s, tales, differs, from, most, other, story, collections, in, this, genre, chiefly, in, its, intense, variation, most, story, collections, focused, on, a, theme, usually, a, religious, one, even, in, the, decameron, storytellers, are, encouraged, to, stick, to, the, theme, decided, on, for, the, day, the, idea, of, a, pilgrimage, to, get, such, a, diverse, collection, of, people, together, for, literary, purposes, was, also, unprecedented, though, the, association, of, pilgrims, and, storytelling, was, a, familiar, one, introducing, a, competition, among, the, tales, encourages, the, reader, to, compare, the, tales, in, all, their, variety, and, allows, chaucer, to, showcase, the, breadth, of, his, skill, in, different, genres, and, literary, forms, while, the, structure, of, the, tales, is, largely, linear, with, one, story, following, another, it, is, also, much, more, than, that, in, the, general, prologue, chaucer, describes, not, the, tales, to, be, told, but, the, people, who, will, tell, them, making, it, clear, that, structure, will, depend, on, the, characters, rather, than, a, general, theme, or, moral, this, idea, is, reinforced, when, the, miller, interrupts, to, tell, his, tale, after, the, knight, has, finished, his, having, the, knight, go, first, gives, one, the, idea, that, all, will, tell, their, stories, by, class, with, the, monk, following, the, knight, however, the, miller, s, interruption, makes, it, clear, that, this, structure, will, be, abandoned, in, favour, of, a, free, and, open, exchange, of, stories, among, all, classes, present, general, themes, and, points, of, view, arise, as, the, characters, tell, their, tales, which, are, responded, to, by, other, characters, in, their, own, tales, sometimes, after, a, long, lapse, in, which, the, theme, has, not, been, addressed, lastly, chaucer, does, not, pay, much, attention, to, the, progress, of, the, trip, to, the, time, passing, as, the, pilgrims, travel, or, to, specific, locations, along, the, way, to, canterbury, his, writing, of, the, story, seems, focused, primarily, on, the, stories, being, told, and, not, on, the, pilgrimage, itself, the, variety, of, chaucer, s, tales, shows, the, breadth, of, his, skill, and, his, familiarity, with, many, literary, forms, linguistic, styles, and, rhetorical, devices, medieval, schools, of, rhetoric, at, the, time, encouraged, such, diversity, dividing, literature, as, virgil, suggests, into, high, middle, and, low, styles, as, measured, by, the, density, of, rhetorical, forms, and, vocabulary, another, popular, method, of, division, came, from, st, augustine, who, focused, more, on, audience, response, and, less, on, subject, matter, a, virgilian, concern, augustine, divided, literature, into, majestic, persuades, temperate, pleases, and, subdued, teaches, writers, were, encouraged, to, write, in, a, way, that, kept, in, mind, the, speaker, subject, audience, purpose, manner, and, occasion, chaucer, moves, freely, between, all, of, these, styles, showing, favouritism, to, none, he, not, only, considers, the, readers, of, his, work, as, an, audience, but, the, other, pilgrims, within, the, story, as, well, creating, a, multi, layered, rhetoric, with, this, chaucer, avoids, targeting, any, specific, audience, or, social, class, of, readers, focusing, instead, on, the, characters, of, the, story, and, writing, their, tales, with, a, skill, proportional, to, their, social, status, and, learning, however, even, the, lowest, characters, such, as, the, miller, show, surprising, rhetorical, ability, although, their, subject, matter, is, more, lowbrow, vocabulary, also, plays, an, important, part, as, those, of, the, higher, classes, refer, to, a, woman, as, a, lady, while, the, lower, classes, use, the, word, wenche, with, no, exceptions, at, times, the, same, word, will, mean, entirely, different, things, between, classes, the, word, pitee, for, example, is, a, noble, concept, to, the, upper, classes, while, in, the, merchant, s, tale, it, refers, to, sexual, intercourse, again, however, tales, such, as, the, nun, s, priest, s, tale, show, surprising, skill, with, words, among, the, lower, classes, of, the, group, while, the, knight, s, tale, is, at, times, extremely, simple, chaucer, uses, the, same, meter, throughout, almost, all, of, his, tales, with, the, exception, of, sir, thopas, and, his, prose, tales, this, is, a, line, characterised, by, five, stressed, syllables, usually, alternating, with, unstressed, syllables, to, produce, lines, usually, of, ten, syllables, but, often, eleven, and, occasionally, nine, occasionally, a, caesura, can, be, identified, around, the, middle, of, a, line, this, metre, was, probably, inspired, by, french, and, italian, forms, chaucer, s, meter, would, later, develop, into, the, heroic, meter, of, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, sometimes, known, as, riding, rhyme, and, is, an, ancestor, of, iambic, pentameter, chaucer, s, verse, is, usually, also, characterised, by, couplet, rhyme, but, he, avoided, allowing, couplets, to, become, too, prominent, in, the, canterbury, tales, and, four, of, the, tales, the, man, of, law, s, clerk, s, prioress, and, second, nun, s, use, rhyme, royal, in, 1386, chaucer, became, controller, of, customs, and, justice, of, the, peace, and, in, 1389, clerk, of, the, king, s, works, it, was, during, these, years, that, chaucer, began, working, on, the, canterbury, tales, the, end, of, the, fourteenth, century, was, a, turbulent, time, in, english, history, the, catholic, church, was, in, the, midst, of, the, western, schism, and, although, it, was, still, the, only, christian, authority, in, western, europe, it, was, the, subject, of, heavy, controversy, lollardy, an, early, english, religious, movement, led, by, john, wycliffe, is, mentioned, in, the, tales, which, also, mention, a, specific, incident, involving, pardoners, sellers, of, indulgences, which, were, believed, to, relieve, the, temporal, punishment, due, for, sins, that, were, already, forgiven, in, the, sacrament, of, confession, who, nefariously, claimed, to, be, collecting, for, st, mary, rouncesval, hospital, in, england, the, canterbury, tales, is, among, the, first, english, literary, works, to, mention, paper, a, relatively, new, invention, that, allowed, dissemination, of, the, written, word, never, before, seen, in, england, political, clashes, such, as, the, 1381, peasants, revolt, and, clashes, ending, in, the, deposing, of, king, richard, ii, further, reveal, the, complex, turmoil, surrounding, chaucer, in, the, time, of, the, tales, writing, many, of, his, close, friends, were, executed, and, he, himself, moved, to, kent, to, get, away, from, events, in, london, while, some, readers, look, to, interpret, the, characters, of, the, canterbury, tales, as, historical, figures, other, readers, choose, to, interpret, its, significance, in, less, literal, terms, after, analysis, of, chaucer, s, diction, and, historical, context, his, work, appears, to, develop, a, critique, of, society, during, his, lifetime, within, a, number, of, his, descriptions, his, comments, can, appear, complimentary, in, nature, but, through, clever, language, the, statements, are, ultimately, critical, of, the, pilgrim, s, actions, it, is, unclear, whether, chaucer, would, intend, for, the, reader, to, link, his, characters, with, actual, persons, instead, it, appears, that, chaucer, creates, fictional, characters, to, be, general, representations, of, people, in, such, fields, of, work, with, an, understanding, of, medieval, society, one, can, detect, subtle, satire, at, work, the, tales, reflect, diverse, views, of, the, church, in, chaucer, s, england, after, the, black, death, many, europeans, began, to, question, the, authority, of, the, established, church, some, turned, to, lollardy, while, others, chose, less, extreme, paths, starting, new, monastic, orders, or, smaller, movements, exposing, church, corruption, in, the, behaviour, of, the, clergy, false, church, relics, or, abuse, of, indulgences, several, characters, in, the, tales, are, religious, figures, and, the, very, setting, of, the, pilgrimage, to, canterbury, is, religious, although, the, prologue, comments, ironically, on, its, merely, seasonal, attractions, making, religion, a, significant, theme, of, the, work, two, characters, the, pardoner, and, the, summoner, whose, roles, apply, the, church, s, secular, power, are, both, portrayed, as, deeply, corrupt, greedy, and, abusive, pardoners, in, chaucer, s, day, were, those, people, from, whom, one, bought, church, indulgences, for, forgiveness, of, sins, who, were, guilty, of, abusing, their, office, for, their, own, gain, chaucer, s, pardoner, openly, admits, the, corruption, of, his, practice, while, hawking, his, wares, summoners, were, church, officers, who, brought, sinners, to, the, church, court, for, possible, excommunication, and, other, penalties, corrupt, summoners, would, write, false, citations, and, frighten, people, into, bribing, them, to, protect, their, interests, chaucer, s, summoner, is, portrayed, as, guilty, of, the, very, kinds, of, sins, for, which, he, is, threatening, to, bring, others, to, court, and, is, hinted, as, having, a, corrupt, relationship, with, the, pardoner, in, the, friar, s, tale, one, of, the, characters, is, a, summoner, who, is, shown, to, be, working, on, the, side, of, the, devil, not, god, churchmen, of, various, kinds, are, represented, by, the, monk, the, prioress, the, nun, s, priest, and, the, second, nun, monastic, orders, which, originated, from, a, desire, to, follow, an, ascetic, lifestyle, separated, from, the, world, had, by, chaucer, s, time, become, increasingly, entangled, in, worldly, matters, monasteries, frequently, controlled, huge, tracts, of, land, on, which, they, made, significant, sums, of, money, while, peasants, worked, in, their, employ, the, second, nun, is, an, example, of, what, a, nun, was, expected, to, be, her, tale, is, about, a, woman, whose, chaste, example, brings, people, into, the, church, the, monk, and, the, prioress, on, the, other, hand, while, not, as, corrupt, as, the, summoner, or, pardoner, fall, far, short, of, the, ideal, for, their, orders, both, are, expensively, dressed, show, signs, of, lives, of, luxury, and, flirtatiousness, and, show, a, lack, of, spiritual, depth, the, prioress, s, tale, is, an, account, of, jews, murdering, a, deeply, pious, and, innocent, christian, boy, a, blood, libel, against, jews, that, became, a, part, of, english, literary, tradition, the, story, did, not, originate, in, the, works, of, chaucer, and, was, well, known, in, the, 14th, century, pilgrimage, was, a, very, prominent, feature, of, medieval, society, the, ultimate, pilgrimage, destination, was, jerusalem, but, within, england, canterbury, was, a, popular, destination, pilgrims, would, journey, to, cathedrals, that, preserved, relics, of, saints, believing, that, such, relics, held, miraculous, powers, saint, thomas, becket, archbishop, of, canterbury, had, been, murdered, in, canterbury, cathedral, by, knights, of, henry, ii, during, a, disagreement, between, church, and, crown, miracle, stories, connected, to, his, remains, sprang, up, soon, after, his, death, and, the, cathedral, became, a, popular, pilgrimage, destination, the, pilgrimage, in, the, work, ties, all, of, the, stories, together, and, may, be, considered, a, representation, of, christians, striving, for, heaven, despite, weaknesses, disagreement, and, diversity, of, opinion, the, upper, class, or, nobility, represented, chiefly, by, the, knight, and, his, squire, was, in, chaucer, s, time, steeped, in, a, culture, of, chivalry, and, courtliness, nobles, were, expected, to, be, powerful, warriors, who, could, be, ruthless, on, the, battlefield, yet, mannerly, in, the, king, s, court, and, christian, in, their, actions, knights, were, expected, to, form, a, strong, social, bond, with, the, men, who, fought, alongside, them, but, an, even, stronger, bond, with, a, woman, whom, they, idealised, to, strengthen, their, fighting, ability, though, the, aim, of, chivalry, was, to, noble, action, its, conflicting, values, often, degenerated, into, violence, church, leaders, frequently, tried, to, place, restrictions, on, jousts, and, tournaments, which, at, times, ended, in, the, death, of, the, loser, the, knight, s, tale, shows, how, the, brotherly, love, of, two, fellow, knights, turns, into, a, deadly, feud, at, the, sight, of, a, woman, whom, both, idealise, to, win, her, both, are, willing, to, fight, to, the, death, chivalry, was, on, the, decline, in, chaucer, s, day, and, it, is, possible, that, the, knight, s, tale, was, intended, to, show, its, flaws, although, this, is, disputed, chaucer, himself, had, fought, in, the, hundred, years, war, under, edward, iii, who, heavily, emphasised, chivalry, during, his, reign, two, tales, sir, topas, and, the, tale, of, melibee, are, told, by, chaucer, himself, who, is, travelling, with, the, pilgrims, in, his, own, story, both, tales, seem, to, focus, on, the, ill, effects, of, chivalry, the, first, making, fun, of, chivalric, rules, and, the, second, warning, against, violence, the, tales, constantly, reflect, the, conflict, between, classes, for, example, the, division, of, the, three, estates, the, characters, are, all, divided, into, three, distinct, classes, the, classes, being, those, who, pray, the, clergy, those, who, fight, the, nobility, and, those, who, work, the, commoners, and, peasantry, most, of, the, tales, are, interlinked, by, common, themes, and, some, quit, reply, to, or, retaliate, against, other, tales, convention, is, followed, when, the, knight, begins, the, game, with, a, tale, as, he, represents, the, highest, social, class, in, the, group, but, when, he, is, followed, by, the, miller, who, represents, a, lower, class, it, sets, the, stage, for, the, tales, to, reflect, both, a, respect, for, and, a, disregard, for, upper, class, rules, helen, cooper, as, well, as, mikhail, bakhtin, and, derek, brewer, call, this, opposition, the, ordered, and, the, grotesque, lent, and, carnival, officially, approved, culture, and, its, riotous, and, high, spirited, underside, several, works, of, the, time, contained, the, same, opposition, chaucer, s, characters, each, express, different, sometimes, vastly, different, views, of, reality, creating, an, atmosphere, of, testing, empathy, and, relativism, as, helen, cooper, says, different, genres, give, different, readings, of, the, world, the, fabliau, scarcely, notices, the, operations, of, god, the, saint, s, life, focuses, on, those, at, the, expense, of, physical, reality, tracts, and, sermons, insist, on, prudential, or, orthodox, morality, romances, privilege, human, emotion, the, sheer, number, of, varying, persons, and, stories, renders, the, tales, as, a, set, unable, to, arrive, at, any, definite, truth, or, reality, the, concept, of, liminality, figures, prominently, within, the, canterbury, tales, a, liminal, space, which, can, be, both, geographical, as, well, as, metaphorical, or, spiritual, is, the, transitional, or, transformational, space, between, a, real, secure, known, limited, world, and, an, unknown, or, imaginary, space, of, both, risk, and, possibility, the, notion, of, a, pilgrimage, is, itself, a, liminal, experience, because, it, centres, on, travel, between, destinations, and, because, pilgrims, undertake, it, hoping, to, become, more, holy, in, the, process, thus, the, structure, of, the, canterbury, tales, itself, is, liminal, it, not, only, covers, the, distance, between, london, and, canterbury, but, the, majority, of, the, tales, refer, to, places, entirely, outside, the, geography, of, the, pilgrimage, jean, jost, summarises, the, function, of, liminality, in, the, canterbury, tales, both, appropriately, and, ironically, in, this, raucous, and, subversive, liminal, space, a, ragtag, assembly, gather, together, and, tell, their, equally, unconventional, tales, in, this, unruly, place, the, rules, of, tale, telling, are, established, themselves, to, be, both, disordered, and, broken, here, the, tales, of, game, and, earnest, solas, and, sentence, will, be, set, and, interrupted, here, the, sacred, and, profane, adventure, begins, but, does, not, end, here, the, condition, of, peril, is, as, prominent, as, that, of, protection, the, act, of, pilgrimaging, itself, consists, of, moving, from, one, urban, space, through, liminal, rural, space, to, the, next, urban, space, with, an, ever, fluctuating, series, of, events, and, narratives, punctuating, those, spaces, the, goal, of, pilgrimage, may, well, be, a, religious, or, spiritual, space, at, its, conclusion, and, reflect, a, psychological, progression, of, the, spirit, in, yet, another, kind, of, emotional, space, liminality, is, also, evident, in, the, individual, tales, an, obvious, instance, of, this, is, the, friar, s, tale, in, which, the, yeoman, devil, is, a, liminal, figure, because, of, his, transitory, nature, and, function, it, is, his, purpose, to, issue, souls, from, their, current, existence, to, hell, an, entirely, different, one, the, franklin, s, tale, is, a, breton, lai, tale, which, takes, the, tale, into, a, liminal, space, by, invoking, not, only, the, interaction, of, the, supernatural, and, the, mortal, but, also, the, relation, between, the, present, and, the, imagined, past, while, chaucer, clearly, states, the, addressees, of, many, of, his, poems, the, book, of, the, duchess, is, believed, to, have, been, written, for, john, of, gaunt, on, the, occasion, of, his, wife, s, death, in, 1368, the, intended, audience, of, the, canterbury, tales, is, more, difficult, to, determine, chaucer, was, a, courtier, leading, some, to, believe, that, he, was, mainly, a, court, poet, who, wrote, exclusively, for, the, nobility, he, is, referred, to, as, a, noble, translator, and, poet, by, eustache, deschamps, and, by, his, contemporary, john, gower, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, poem, was, intended, to, be, read, aloud, which, is, probable, as, this, was, a, common, activity, at, the, time, however, it, also, seems, to, have, been, intended, for, private, reading, since, chaucer, frequently, refers, to, himself, as, the, writer, rather, than, the, speaker, of, the, work, determining, the, intended, audience, directly, from, the, text, is, even, more, difficult, since, the, audience, is, part, of, the, story, this, makes, it, difficult, to, tell, when, chaucer, is, writing, to, the, fictional, pilgrim, audience, or, the, actual, reader, chaucer, s, works, may, have, been, distributed, in, some, form, during, his, lifetime, in, part, or, in, whole, scholars, speculate, that, manuscripts, were, circulated, among, his, friends, but, likely, remained, unknown, to, most, people, until, after, his, death, however, the, speed, with, which, copyists, strove, to, write, complete, versions, of, his, tale, in, manuscript, form, shows, that, chaucer, was, a, famous, and, respected, poet, in, his, own, day, the, hengwrt, and, ellesmere, manuscripts, are, examples, of, the, care, taken, to, distribute, the, work, more, manuscript, copies, of, the, poem, exist, than, for, any, other, poem, of, its, day, except, the, prick, of, conscience, causing, some, scholars, to, give, it, the, medieval, equivalent, of, bestseller, status, even, the, most, elegant, of, the, illustrated, manuscripts, however, is, not, nearly, as, highly, decorated, as, the, work, of, authors, of, more, respectable, works, such, as, john, lydgate, s, religious, and, historical, literature, john, lydgate, and, thomas, occleve, were, among, the, first, critics, of, chaucer, s, tales, praising, the, poet, as, the, greatest, english, poet, of, all, time, and, the, first, to, show, what, the, language, was, truly, capable, of, poetically, this, sentiment, was, universally, agreed, upon, by, later, critics, into, the, mid, 15th, century, glosses, included, in, the, canterbury, tales, manuscripts, of, the, time, praised, him, highly, for, his, skill, with, sentence, and, rhetoric, the, two, pillars, by, which, medieval, critics, judged, poetry, the, most, respected, of, the, tales, was, at, this, time, the, knight, s, as, it, was, full, of, both, the, incompleteness, of, the, tales, led, several, medieval, authors, to, write, additions, and, supplements, to, the, tales, to, make, them, more, complete, some, of, the, oldest, existing, manuscripts, of, the, tales, include, new, or, modified, tales, showing, that, even, early, on, such, additions, were, being, created, these, emendations, included, various, expansions, of, the, cook, s, tale, which, chaucer, never, finished, the, plowman, s, tale, the, tale, of, gamelyn, the, siege, of, thebes, and, the, tale, of, beryn, the, tale, of, beryn, written, by, an, anonymous, author, in, the, 15th, century, is, preceded, by, a, lengthy, prologue, in, which, the, pilgrims, arrive, at, canterbury, and, their, activities, there, are, described, while, the, rest, of, the, pilgrims, disperse, throughout, the, town, the, pardoner, seeks, the, affections, of, kate, the, barmaid, but, faces, problems, dealing, with, the, man, in, her, life, and, the, innkeeper, harry, bailey, as, the, pilgrims, turn, back, home, the, merchant, restarts, the, storytelling, with, tale, of, beryn, in, this, tale, a, young, man, named, beryn, travels, from, rome, to, egypt, to, seek, his, fortune, only, to, be, cheated, by, other, businessmen, there, he, is, then, aided, by, a, local, man, in, getting, his, revenge, the, tale, comes, from, the, french, tale, b, rinus, and, exists, in, a, single, early, manuscript, of, the, tales, although, it, was, printed, along, with, the, tales, in, a, 1721, edition, by, john, urry, john, lydgate, wrote, the, siege, of, thebes, in, about, 1420, like, the, tale, of, beryn, it, is, preceded, by, a, prologue, in, which, the, pilgrims, arrive, in, canterbury, lydgate, places, himself, among, the, pilgrims, as, one, of, them, and, describes, how, he, was, a, part, of, chaucer, s, trip, and, heard, the, stories, he, characterises, himself, as, a, monk, and, tells, a, long, story, about, the, history, of, thebes, before, the, events, of, the, knight, s, tale, john, lydgate, s, tale, was, popular, early, on, and, exists, in, old, manuscripts, both, on, its, own, and, as, part, of, the, tales, it, was, first, printed, as, early, as, 1561, by, john, stow, and, several, editions, for, centuries, after, followed, suit, there, are, actually, two, versions, of, the, plowman, s, tale, both, of, which, are, influenced, by, the, story, piers, plowman, a, work, written, during, chaucer, s, lifetime, chaucer, describes, a, plowman, in, the, general, prologue, of, his, tales, but, never, gives, him, his, own, tale, one, tale, written, by, thomas, occleve, describes, the, miracle, of, the, virgin, and, the, sleeveless, garment, another, tale, features, a, pelican, and, a, griffin, debating, church, corruption, with, the, pelican, taking, a, position, of, protest, akin, to, john, wycliffe, s, ideas, the, tale, of, gamelyn, was, included, in, an, early, manuscript, version, of, the, tales, harley, 7334, which, is, notorious, for, being, one, of, the, lower, quality, early, manuscripts, in, terms, of, editor, error, and, alteration, it, is, now, widely, rejected, by, scholars, as, an, authentic, chaucerian, tale, although, some, scholars, think, he, may, have, intended, to, rewrite, the, story, as, a, tale, for, the, yeoman, dates, for, its, authorship, vary, from, 1340, to, 1370, general, online, texts, facsimiles
