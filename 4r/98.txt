at, least, accept, as, natural, the, very, things, the, satirist, wishes, to, question, satire, is, found, in, many, artistic, forms, of, expression, including, internet, memes, literature, plays, commentary, music, film, and, television, shows, and, media, such, as, lyrics, the, word, satire, comes, from, the, latin, word, satur, and, the, subsequent, phrase, lanx, satura, satur, meant, full, but, the, juxtaposition, with, lanx, shifted, the, meaning, to, miscellany, or, medley, the, expression, lanx, satura, literally, means, a, full, dish, of, various, kinds, of, fruits, the, use, of, the, word, lanx, in, this, phrase, however, is, disputed, by, b, l, ullman, the, word, satura, as, used, by, quintilian, however, was, used, to, denote, only, roman, verse, satire, a, strict, genre, that, imposed, hexameter, form, a, narrower, genre, than, what, would, be, later, intended, as, satire, quintilian, famously, said, that, satura, that, is, a, satire, in, hexameter, verses, was, a, literary, genre, of, wholly, roman, origin, satura, tota, nostra, est, he, was, aware, of, and, commented, on, greek, satire, but, at, the, time, did, not, label, it, as, such, although, today, the, origin, of, satire, is, considered, to, be, aristophanes, old, comedy, the, first, critic, to, use, the, term, satire, in, the, modern, broader, sense, was, apuleius, to, quintilian, the, satire, was, a, strict, literary, form, but, the, term, soon, escaped, from, the, original, narrow, definition, robert, elliott, writes, as, soon, as, a, noun, enters, the, domain, of, metaphor, as, one, modern, scholar, has, pointed, out, it, clamours, for, extension, and, satura, which, had, had, no, verbal, adverbial, or, adjectival, forms, was, immediately, broadened, by, appropriation, from, the, greek, word, for, satyr, satyros, and, its, derivatives, the, odd, result, is, that, the, english, satire, comes, from, the, latin, satura, but, satirize, satiric, etc, are, of, greek, origin, by, about, the, 4th, century, ad, the, writer, of, satires, came, to, be, known, as, satyricus, st, jerome, for, example, was, called, by, one, of, his, enemies, a, satirist, in, prose, satyricus, scriptor, in, prosa, subsequent, orthographic, modifications, obscured, the, latin, origin, of, the, word, satire, satura, becomes, satyra, and, in, england, by, the, 16th, century, it, was, written, satyre, the, word, satire, derives, from, satura, and, its, origin, was, not, influenced, by, the, greek, mythological, figure, of, the, satyr, in, the, 17th, century, philologist, isaac, casaubon, was, the, first, to, dispute, the, etymology, of, satire, from, satyr, contrary, to, the, belief, up, to, that, time, the, rules, of, satire, are, such, that, it, must, do, more, than, make, you, laugh, no, matter, how, amusing, it, is, it, doesn, t, count, unless, you, find, yourself, wincing, a, little, even, as, you, chuckle, laughter, is, not, an, essential, component, of, satire, in, fact, there, are, types, of, satire, that, are, not, meant, to, be, funny, at, all, conversely, not, all, humour, even, on, such, topics, as, politics, religion, or, art, is, necessarily, satirical, even, when, it, uses, the, satirical, tools, of, irony, parody, and, burlesque, even, light, hearted, satire, has, a, serious, after, taste, the, organizers, of, the, ig, nobel, prize, describe, this, as, first, make, people, laugh, and, then, make, them, think, satire, and, irony, in, some, cases, have, been, regarded, as, the, most, effective, source, to, understand, a, society, the, oldest, form, of, social, study, they, provide, the, keenest, insights, into, a, group, s, collective, psyche, reveal, its, deepest, values, and, tastes, and, the, society, s, structures, of, power, some, authors, have, regarded, satire, as, superior, to, non, comic, and, non, artistic, disciplines, like, history, or, anthropology, in, a, prominent, example, from, ancient, greece, philosopher, plato, when, asked, by, a, friend, for, a, book, to, understand, athenian, society, referred, him, to, the, plays, of, aristophanes, historically, satire, has, satisfied, the, popular, need, to, debunk, and, ridicule, the, leading, figures, in, politics, economy, religion, and, other, prominent, realms, of, power, satire, confronts, public, discourse, and, the, collective, imaginary, playing, as, a, public, opinion, counterweight, to, power, be, it, political, economic, religious, symbolic, or, otherwise, by, challenging, leaders, and, authorities, for, instance, it, forces, administrations, to,

to, mock, prominent, individuals, and, institutions, the, satiric, impulse, and, its, ritualized, expressions, carry, out, the, function, of, resolving, social, tension, institutions, like, the, ritual, clowns, by, giving, expression, to, the, antisocial, tendencies, represent, a, safety, valve, which, re, establishes, equilibrium, and, health, in, the, collective, imaginary, which, are, jeopardized, by, the, repressive, aspects, of, society, the, state, of, political, satire, in, a, given, society, reflects, the, tolerance, or, intolerance, that, characterizes, it, and, the, state, of, civil, liberties, and, human, rights, under, totalitarian, regimes, any, criticism, of, a, political, system, and, especially, satire, is, suppressed, a, typical, example, is, the, soviet, union,

sarcastic, satire, is, often, misunderstood, a, typical, misunderstanding, is, to, confuse, the, satirist, with, their, persona, common, uncomprehending, responses, to, satire, include, revulsion, accusations, of, poor, taste, or, that, it, s, just, not, funny, for, instance, and, the, idea, that, the, satirist, actually, does, support, the, ideas, policies, or, people, being, ridiculed, for,

that, irony, was, dead, some, critics, of, mark, twain, see, huckleberry, finn, as, racist, and, offensive, missing, the, point, that, its, author, clearly, intended, it, to, be, satire, racism, being, in, fact, only, one, of, a, number, of, mark, twain, s, known, concerns, attacked, in, huckleberry, finn, this, same, misconception, was, suffered, by, the, main, character, of, the, 1960s,

classical, satiric, fashion, the, heartlessness, of, people, who, are, reluctant, to, donate, to, charities, was, widely, interpreted, as, an, attack, on, the, make, a, wish, foundation, or, even, the, terminally, ill, children, helped, by, that, organisation, prime, minister, of, the, time, kevin, rudd, stated, that, the, chaser, team, should, hang, their, heads, in, shame, he, went, on, to,

the, romantic, movement, that, satire, is, something, unworthy, of, serious, attention, this, prejudice, has, held, considerable, influence, to, this, day, such, prejudice, extends, to, humour, and, everything, that, arouses, laughter, which, are, often, underestimated, as, frivolous, and, unworthy, of, serious, study, for, instance, humor, is, generally, neglected, as, a, topic, of, anthropological, research, and, teaching, because, satire, criticises, in, an, ironic, essentially, indirect, way, it, frequently, escapes, censorship, in, a, way, more, direct, criticism, might, not, periodically, however, it, runs, into, serious, opposition, and, people, in, power, who, perceive, themselves, as, attacked, attempt, to, censor, it, or, prosecute, its, practitioners, in, a, classic,

volumes, of, satire, by, john, marston, thomas, middleton, joseph, hall, and, others, it, also, required, histories, and, plays, to, be, specially, approved, by, a, member, of, the, queen, s, privy, council, and, it, prohibited, the, future, printing, of, satire, in, verse, the, motives, for, the, ban, are, obscure, particularly, since, some, of, the, books, banned, had, been, licensed, by, the, same, authorities, less, than, a, year, earlier, various, scholars, have, argued, that, the, target, was, obscenity, libel, or, sedition, it, seems, likely, that, lingering, anxiety, about, the,
