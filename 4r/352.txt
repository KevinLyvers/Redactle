a, pan, flute, also, known, as, panpipes, or, syrinx, is, a, musical, instrument, based, on, the, principle, of, the, closed, tube, consisting, of, multiple, pipes, of, gradually, increasing, length, and, occasionally, girth, multiple, varieties, of, pan, flutes, have, been, popular, as, folk, instruments, the, pipes, are, typically, made, from, bamboo, giant, cane, or, local, reeds, other, materials, include, wood, plastic, metal, and, clay, the, pan, flute, is, named, after, pan, the, greek, god, of, nature, and, shepherds, often, depicted, with, such, an, instrument, the, pan, flute, has, become, widely, associated, with, the, character, peter, pan, created, by, sir, james, matthew, barrie, whose, name, was, inspired, by, the, god, pan, in, greek, mythology, syrinx, was, a, forest, nymph, in, her, attempt, to, escape, the, affection, of, god, pan, a, creature, half, goat, and, half, man, she, was, transformed, into, a, water, reed, or, calamos, cane, reed, then, pan, cut, several, reeds, placed, them, in, parallel, one, next, to, the, other, and, bound, them, together, to, make, a, melodic, musical, instrument, ancient, greeks, called, this, instrument, syrinx, in, honour, of, the, muse, and, pandean, or, pan, pipes, and, pan, flute, after, pan, syrinx, was, a, different, musical, instrument, from, aulos, aulos, is, often, translated, as, flute, or, double, flute, in, english, the, syrinx, a, predominantly, pastoral, instrument, for, the, greeks, was, adopted, by, the, etruscans, who, played, it, at, their, festivals, and, banquets, the, etruscans, called, it, fistula, the, romans, adopted, the, syrinx, from, the, greeks, and, the, etruscans, and, they, too, played, it, at, their, banquets, festivals, as, well, as, in, religious, and, funeral, processions, the, pan, flute, s, tubes, are, stopped, at, one, end, at, which, the, standing, wave, is, reflected, giving, a, note, an, octave, lower, than, that, produced, by, an, open, pipe, of, equal, length, in, the, traditional, south, american, style, pipes, are, fine, tuned, to, correct, pitch, by, placing, small, pebbles, or, dry, corn, kernels, into, the, bottom, of, the, pipes, contemporary, makers, of, curved, romanian, style, panpipes, use, wax, commonly, beeswax, to, tune, new, instruments, special, tools, are, used, to, place, or, remove, the, wax, corks, and, rubber, stoppers, are, also, used, and, are, easier, to, quickly, tune, pipes, the, pan, flute, is, an, end, blown, flute, sound, is, produced, by, the, vibration, of, an, air, stream, blowing, across, an, open, hole, at, the, end, of, a, resonating, tube, the, length, of, the, tube, determines, the, fundamental, frequency, an, overblown, harmonic, register, is, near, a, 12th, above, the, fundamental, in, cylindrical, tubes, but, can, approach, an, octave, jump, 8th, if, a, decreasing, taper, is, used, according, to, the, fundamental, principle, for, pan, flutes, the, frequency, and, the, length, of, the, tube, are, inversely, proportional, every, time, the, pitch, goes, up, one, octave, the, frequency, doubles, because, there, are, 12, notes, in, a, chromatic, scale, or, a, full, octave, every, half, step, in, a, chromatic, scale, is, multiplied, by, the, 12th, root, of, 2, to, get, the, note, next, to, it, by, this, it, is, possible, to, calculate, the, length, of, any, pipe, given, that, one, knows, the, length, of, any, one, pipe, the, formula, for, calculating, the, length, of, a, pan, flute, pipe, is, l, c, f, 4, the, theoretical, length, l, equals, the, speed, of, sound, c, 343, m, s, divided, by, the, desired, frequency, in, hertz, f, that, quantity, divided, by, 4, this, simplifies, and, rearranges, to, length, of, pipe, in, centimeters, frequency, in, hertz, 8575, because, of, a, property, of, compression, within, the, tube, the, length, must, be, a, little, shorter, to, correct, flat, pitch, the, extra, length, is, helpful, for, a, maker, who, can, use, a, cork, or, plug, at, the, bottom, to, adjust, the, pitch, some, instruments, use, wax, or, pellets, to, tune, the, fundamental, pitch, of, each, tube, a, tube, that, has, a, diameter, 1, 10, of, its, length, yields, a, typical, tone, colour, see, timbre, an, inner, diameter, range, between, 1, 7, and, 1, 14, of, the, length, l, is, acceptable, a, narrow, tube, will, sound, reedy, while, a, wide, one, will, sound, flutey, a, more, exact, method, is, to, multiply, the, bore, diameter, by, 0, 82, and, subtract, this, value, from, the, tube, length, this, compensates, for, internal, compression, slowing, frequency, and, the, lips, partially, covering, the, voicing, only, tiny, adjustments, will, be, needed, then, to, adjust, fundamental, pitch, for, air, density, and, temperature, the, pan, flute, is, played, by, blowing, horizontally, across, an, open, end, against, the, sharp, inner, edge, of, the, pipes, each, pipe, is, tuned, to, a, keynote, called, the, fundamental, frequency, by, overblowing, that, is, increasing, the, pressure, of, breath, and, tension, of, lips, odd, harmonics, notes, whose, frequencies, are, odd, number, multiples, of, the, fundamental, near, a, 12th, in, cylindrical, tubes, may, also, be, produced, the, romanian, pan, flute, has, the, pipes, arranged, in, a, curved, array, solidly, glued, together, unlike, andean, versions, which, are, usually, tied, together, thus, the, player, can, easily, reach, all, the, notes, by, simply, swiveling, the, head, or, by, moving, the, instrument, with, the, hands, these, instruments, can, also, play, all, the, sharps, and, flats, with, a, special, technique, of, both, tilting, the, pipes, and, jaw, movement, thus, reducing, the, size, of, the, pipe, s, opening, and, producing, a, change, in, pitch, a, very, advanced, player, can, play, any, scale, and, in, any, key, there, are, two, styles, of, vibrato, possible, hand, vibrato, and, breath, vibrato, in, hand, vibrato, the, pitch, is, shifted, up, and, down, like, a, vocal, vibrato, the, player, gently, moves, one, end, of, the, pan, flute, usually, the, high, end, somewhat, similar, to, violin, vibrato, breath, or, throat, vibrato, which, is, more, accurately, described, as, a, tremolo, or, volume, swell, is, the, same, technique, used, by, players, of, the, flute, and, other, woodwinds, by, use, of, the, player, s, diaphragm, or, throat, muscles, the, curved, style, pan, flute, was, popularized, by, the, romanian, musician, gheorghe, zamfir, who, toured, extensively, and, recorded, many, albums, of, pan, flute, music, in, the, 1970s, and, by, several, other, artists, who, began, recording, at, the, same, time, today, there, are, thousands, of, devoted, players, across, europe, asia, and, the, americas, both, the, curved, and, traditional, south, american, variations, are, also, very, popular, in, peruvian, traditional, groups, and, other, andean, music, in, laos, and, thailand, there, is, a, cylindrical, version, called, the, wot, used, in, folk, music, from, the, isaan, region, of, the, country, the, player, alters, notes, by, rotating, the, instrument, with, the, hands, rather, than, by, head, movements, some, new, designs, are, beginning, to, appear, as, designers, and, makers, take, advantage, of, computer, aided, design, and, 3d, additive, manufacturing, to, move, past, the, limitations, of, traditional, tool, and, materials, these, new, pan, flutes, address, some, long, standing, issues, to, make, it, an, easier, instrument, to, learn, and, to, play, accurately
