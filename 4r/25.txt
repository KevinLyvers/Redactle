renaissance, architecture, is, the, european, architecture, of, the, period, between, the, early, 15th, and, early, 16th, centuries, in, different, regions, demonstrating, a, conscious, revival, and, development, of, certain, elements, of, ancient, greek, and, roman, thought, and, material, culture, stylistically, renaissance, architecture, followed, gothic, architecture, and, was, succeeded, by, baroque, architecture, and, neoclassical, architecture, developed, first, in, florence, with, filippo, brunelleschi, as, one, of, its, innovators, the, renaissance, style, quickly, spread, to, other, italian, cities, the, style, was, carried, to, other, parts, of, europe, at, different, dates, and, with, varying, degrees, of, impact, renaissance, style, places, emphasis, on, symmetry, proportion, geometry, and, the, regularity, of, parts, as, demonstrated, in, the, architecture, of, classical, antiquity, and, in, particular, ancient, roman, architecture, of, which, many, examples, remained, orderly, arrangements, of, columns, pilasters, and, lintels, as, well, as, the, use, of, semicircular, arches, hemispherical, domes, niches, and, aediculae, replaced, the, more, complex, proportional, systems, and, irregular, profiles, of, medieval, buildings, the, word, renaissance, derives, from, the, term, rinascita, which, means, rebirth, first, appeared, in, giorgio, vasari, s, lives, of, the, most, excellent, painters, sculptors, and, architects, 1550, although, the, term, renaissance, was, used, first, by, the, french, historian, jules, michelet, it, was, given, its, more, lasting, definition, from, the, swiss, historian, jacob, burckhardt, whose, book, the, civilization, of, the, renaissance, in, italy, 1860, was, influential, in, the, development, of, the, modern, interpretation, of, the, italian, renaissance, the, folio, of, measured, drawings, difices, de, rome, moderne, ou, recueil, des, palais, maisons, glises, couvents, et, autres, monuments, the, buildings, of, modern, rome, first, published, in, 1840, by, paul, letarouilly, also, played, an, important, part, in, the, revival, of, interest, in, this, period, erwin, panofsky, renaissance, and, renascences, in, western, art, new, york, harper, and, row, 1960, the, renaissance, style, was, recognized, by, contemporaries, in, the, term, all, antica, or, in, the, ancient, manner, of, the, romans, historians, often, divide, the, renaissance, in, italy, into, three, phases, whereas, art, historians, might, talk, of, an, early, renaissance, period, in, which, they, include, developments, in, 14th, century, painting, and, sculpture, this, is, usually, not, the, case, in, architectural, history, the, bleak, economic, conditions, of, the, late, 14th, century, did, not, produce, buildings, that, are, considered, to, be, part, of, the, renaissance, as, a, result, the, word, renaissance, among, architectural, historians, usually, applies, to, the, period, 1400, to, c, 1525, or, later, in, the, case, of, non, italian, renaissances, historians, often, use, the, following, designations, during, the, quattrocento, sometimes, known, as, the, early, renaissance, concepts, of, architectural, order, were, explored, and, rules, were, formulated, the, study, of, classical, antiquity, led, in, particular, to, the, adoption, of, classical, detail, and, ornamentation, space, as, an, element, of, architecture, was, used, differently, than, it, was, in, the, middle, ages, space, was, organised, by, proportional, logic, its, form, and, rhythm, subject, to, geometry, rather, than, being, created, by, intuition, as, in, medieval, buildings, the, prime, example, of, this, is, the, basilica, of, san, lorenzo, florence, by, filippo, brunelleschi, 1377, 1446, during, the, high, renaissance, concepts, derived, from, classical, antiquity, were, developed, and, used, with, greater, confidence, the, most, representative, architect, is, donato, bramante, 1444, 1514, who, expanded, the, applicability, of, classical, architecture, to, contemporary, buildings, his, tempietto, di, san, pietro, in, montorio, 1503, was, directly, inspired, by, circular, roman, temples, he, was, however, hardly, a, slave, to, the, classical, forms, and, it, was, his, style, that, was, to, dominate, italian, architecture, in, the, 16th, century, during, the, mannerist, period, architects, experimented, with, using, architectural, forms, to, emphasize, solid, and, spatial, relationships, the, renaissance, ideal, of, harmony, gave, way, to, freer, and, more, imaginative, rhythms, the, best, known, architect, associated, with, the, mannerist, style, was, michelangelo, 1475, 1564, who, frequently, used, the, giant, order, in, his, architecture, a, large, pilaster, that, stretches, from, the, bottom, to, the, top, of, a, fa, ade, he, used, this, in, his, design, for, the, piazza, del, campidoglio, in, rome, prior, to, the, 20th, century, the, term, mannerism, had, negative, connotations, but, it, is, now, used, to, describe, the, historical, period, in, more, general, non, judgemental, terms, as, the, new, style, of, architecture, spread, out, from, italy, most, other, european, countries, developed, a, sort, of, proto, renaissance, style, before, the, construction, of, fully, formulated, renaissance, buildings, each, country, in, turn, then, grafted, its, own, architectural, traditions, to, the, new, style, so, that, renaissance, buildings, across, europe, are, diversified, by, region, within, italy, the, evolution, of, renaissance, architecture, into, mannerism, with, widely, diverging, tendencies, in, the, work, of, michelangelo, giulio, romano, and, andrea, palladio, led, to, the, baroque, style, in, which, the, same, architectural, vocabulary, was, used, for, very, different, rhetoric, outside, italy, baroque, architecture, was, more, widespread, and, fully, developed, than, the, renaissance, style, with, significant, buildings, as, far, afield, as, mexico, and, the, philippines, italy, of, the, 15th, century, and, the, city, of, florence, in, particular, was, home, to, the, renaissance, it, is, in, florence, that, the, new, architectural, style, had, its, beginning, not, slowly, evolving, in, the, way, that, gothic, grew, out, of, romanesque, but, consciously, brought, to, being, by, particular, architects, who, sought, to, revive, the, order, of, a, past, golden, age, the, scholarly, approach, to, the, architecture, of, the, ancient, coincided, with, the, general, revival, of, learning, a, number, of, factors, were, influential, in, bringing, this, about, italian, architects, had, always, preferred, forms, that, were, clearly, defined, and, structural, members, that, expressed, their, purpose, many, tuscan, romanesque, buildings, demonstrate, these, characteristics, as, seen, in, the, florence, baptistery, and, pisa, cathedral, italy, had, never, fully, adopted, the, gothic, style, of, architecture, apart, from, milan, cathedral, influenced, by, french, rayonnant, gothic, few, italian, churches, show, the, emphasis, on, vertical, the, clustered, shafts, ornate, tracery, and, complex, ribbed, vaulting, that, characterise, gothic, in, other, parts, of, europe, the, presence, particularly, in, rome, of, ancient, architectural, remains, showing, the, ordered, classical, style, provided, an, inspiration, to, artists, at, a, time, when, philosophy, was, also, turning, towards, the, classical, in, the, 15th, century, florence, and, venice, extended, their, power, through, much, of, the, area, that, surrounded, them, making, the, movement, of, artists, possible, this, enabled, florence, to, have, significant, artistic, influence, in, milan, and, through, milan, france, in, 1377, the, return, of, the, pope, from, the, avignon, papacy, and, the, re, establishment, of, the, papal, court, in, rome, brought, wealth, and, importance, to, that, city, as, well, as, a, renewal, in, the, importance, of, the, pope, in, italy, which, was, further, strengthened, by, the, council, of, constance, in, 1417, successive, popes, especially, julius, ii, 1503, 13, sought, to, extend, the, papacy, s, temporal, power, throughout, italy, in, the, early, renaissance, venice, controlled, sea, trade, over, goods, from, the, east, the, large, towns, of, northern, italy, were, prosperous, through, trade, with, the, rest, of, europe, genoa, providing, a, seaport, for, the, goods, of, france, and, spain, milan, and, turin, being, centres, of, overland, trade, and, maintaining, substantial, metalworking, industries, trade, brought, wool, from, england, to, florence, ideally, located, on, the, river, for, the, production, of, fine, cloth, the, industry, on, which, its, wealth, was, founded, by, dominating, pisa, florence, gained, a, seaport, and, became, the, most, powerful, state, in, tuscany, in, this, commercial, climate, one, family, in, particular, turned, their, attention, from, trade, to, the, lucrative, business, of, money, lending, the, medici, became, the, chief, bankers, to, the, princes, of, europe, becoming, virtually, princes, themselves, as, they, did, so, by, reason, of, both, wealth, and, influence, along, the, trade, routes, and, thus, offered, some, protection, by, commercial, interest, moved, not, only, goods, but, also, artists, scientists, and, philosophers, the, return, of, the, pope, gregory, xi, from, avignon, in, september, 1377, and, the, resultant, new, emphasis, on, rome, as, the, center, of, christian, spirituality, brought, about, a, surge, in, the, building, of, churches, in, rome, such, as, had, not, taken, place, for, nearly, a, thousand, years, this, commenced, in, the, mid, 15th, century, and, gained, momentum, in, the, 16th, century, reaching, its, peak, in, the, baroque, period, the, construction, of, the, sistine, chapel, with, its, uniquely, important, decorations, and, the, entire, rebuilding, of, st, peter, s, basilica, one, of, christendom, s, most, significant, churches, were, part, of, this, process, in, the, wealthy, republic, of, florence, the, impetus, for, church, building, was, more, civic, than, spiritual, the, unfinished, state, of, the, enormous, florence, cathedral, dedicated, to, the, blessed, virgin, mary, did, no, honour, to, the, city, under, her, patronage, however, as, the, technology, and, finance, were, found, to, complete, it, the, rising, dome, did, credit, not, only, to, the, virgin, mary, its, architect, and, the, church, but, also, to, the, signoria, the, guilds, and, the, sectors, of, the, city, from, which, the, manpower, to, construct, it, was, drawn, the, dome, inspired, further, religious, works, in, florence, the, development, of, printed, books, the, rediscovery, of, ancient, writings, the, expanding, of, political, and, trade, contacts, and, the, exploration, of, the, world, all, increased, knowledge, and, the, desire, for, education, the, reading, of, philosophies, that, were, not, based, on, christian, theology, led, to, the, development, of, humanism, through, which, it, was, clear, that, while, god, had, established, and, maintained, order, in, the, universe, it, was, the, role, of, man, to, establish, and, maintain, order, in, society, through, humanism, civic, pride, and, the, promotion, of, civil, peace, and, order, were, seen, as, the, marks, of, citizenship, this, led, to, the, building, of, structures, such, as, brunelleschi, s, hospital, of, the, innocents, with, its, elegant, colonnade, forming, a, link, between, the, charitable, building, and, the, public, square, and, the, laurentian, library, where, the, collection, of, books, established, by, the, medici, family, could, be, consulted, by, scholars, some, major, ecclesiastical, building, works, were, also, commissioned, not, by, the, church, but, by, guilds, representing, the, wealth, and, power, of, the, city, brunelleschi, s, dome, at, florence, cathedral, more, than, any, other, building, belonged, to, the, populace, because, the, construction, of, each, of, the, eight, segments, was, achieved, by, a, different, quarter, of, the, city, as, in, the, platonic, academy, of, athens, it, was, seen, by, those, of, humanist, understanding, that, those, people, who, had, the, benefit, of, wealth, and, education, ought, to, promote, the, pursuit, of, learning, and, the, creation, of, that, which, was, beautiful, to, this, end, wealthy, families, the, medici, of, florence, the, gonzaga, of, mantua, the, farnese, in, rome, the, sforzas, in, milan, gathered, around, them, people, of, learning, and, ability, promoting, the, skills, and, creating, employment, for, the, most, talented, artists, and, architects, of, their, day, during, the, renaissance, architecture, became, not, only, a, question, of, practice, but, also, a, matter, for, theoretical, discussion, printing, played, a, large, role, in, the, dissemination, of, ideas, in, the, 15th, century, the, courts, of, certain, other, italian, states, became, centres, for, spreading, of, renaissance, philosophy, art, and, architecture, in, mantua, at, the, court, of, the, gonzaga, alberti, designed, two, churches, the, basilica, of, sant, andrea, and, san, sebastiano, urbino, was, an, important, centre, with, the, ducal, palace, being, constructed, for, federico, da, montefeltro, in, the, mid, 15th, century, the, duke, employed, luciano, laurana, from, dalmatia, renowned, for, his, expertise, at, fortification, the, design, incorporates, much, of, the, earlier, medieval, building, and, includes, an, unusual, turreted, three, storeyed, fa, ade, laurana, was, assisted, by, francesco, di, giorgio, martini, later, parts, of, the, building, are, clearly, florentine, in, style, particularly, the, inner, courtyard, but, it, is, not, known, who, the, designer, was, ferrara, under, the, este, was, expanded, in, the, late, 15th, century, with, several, new, palaces, being, built, such, as, the, palazzo, dei, diamanti, and, palazzo, schifanoia, for, borso, d, este, in, milan, under, the, visconti, the, certosa, di, pavia, was, completed, and, then, later, under, the, sforza, the, castello, sforzesco, was, built, venetian, renaissance, architecture, developed, a, particularly, distinctive, character, because, of, local, conditions, san, zaccaria, received, its, renaissance, fa, ade, at, the, hands, of, antonio, gambello, and, mauro, codussi, begun, in, the, 1480s, giovanni, maria, falconetto, the, veronese, architect, sculptor, introduced, renaissance, architecture, to, padua, with, the, loggia, and, odeo, cornaro, in, the, garden, of, alvise, cornaro, in, southern, italy, renaissance, masters, were, called, to, naples, by, alfonso, v, of, aragon, after, his, conquest, of, the, kingdom, of, naples, the, most, notable, examples, of, renaissance, architecture, in, that, city, are, the, cappella, caracciolo, attributed, to, bramante, and, the, palazzo, orsini, di, gravina, built, by, gabriele, d, angelo, between, 1513, and, 1549, the, classical, orders, were, analysed, and, reconstructed, to, serve, new, purposes, while, the, obvious, distinguishing, features, of, classical, roman, architecture, were, adopted, by, renaissance, architects, the, forms, and, purposes, of, buildings, had, changed, over, time, as, had, the, structure, of, cities, among, the, earliest, buildings, of, the, reborn, classicism, were, the, type, of, churches, that, the, romans, had, never, constructed, neither, were, there, models, for, the, type, of, large, city, dwellings, required, by, wealthy, merchants, of, the, 15th, century, conversely, there, was, no, call, for, enormous, sporting, fixtures, and, public, bath, houses, such, as, the, romans, had, built, the, plans, of, renaissance, buildings, have, a, square, symmetrical, appearance, in, which, proportions, are, usually, based, on, a, module, within, a, church, the, module, is, often, the, width, of, an, aisle, the, need, to, integrate, the, design, of, the, plan, with, the, fa, ade, was, introduced, as, an, issue, in, the, work, of, filippo, brunelleschi, but, he, was, never, able, to, carry, this, aspect, of, his, work, into, fruition, the, first, building, to, demonstrate, this, was, basilica, of, sant, andrea, mantua, by, leone, battista, alberti, the, development, of, the, plan, in, secular, architecture, was, to, take, place, in, the, 16th, century, and, culminated, with, the, work, of, palladio, fa, ades, are, symmetrical, around, their, vertical, axis, church, fa, ades, are, generally, surmounted, by, a, pediment, and, organised, by, a, system, of, pilasters, arches, and, entablatures, the, columns, and, windows, show, a, progression, towards, the, centre, one, of, the, first, true, renaissance, fa, ades, was, pienza, cathedral, 1459, 62, which, has, been, attributed, to, the, florentine, architect, bernardo, gambarelli, known, as, rossellino, with, leone, battista, alberti, perhaps, having, some, responsibility, in, its, design, as, well, domestic, buildings, are, often, surmounted, by, a, cornice, there, is, a, regular, repetition, of, openings, on, each, floor, and, the, centrally, placed, door, is, marked, by, a, feature, such, as, a, balcony, or, rusticated, surround, an, early, and, much, copied, prototype, was, the, fa, ade, for, the, palazzo, rucellai, 1446, and, 1451, in, florence, with, its, three, registers, of, pilasters, roman, and, greek, orders, of, columns, are, used, tuscan, doric, ionic, corinthian, and, composite, the, orders, can, either, be, structural, supporting, an, arcade, or, architrave, or, purely, decorative, set, against, a, wall, in, the, form, of, pilasters, during, the, renaissance, architects, aimed, to, use, columns, pilasters, and, entablatures, as, an, integrated, system, one, of, the, first, buildings, to, use, pilasters, as, an, integrated, system, was, in, the, old, sacristy, 1421, 1440, by, brunelleschi, arches, are, semi, circular, or, in, the, mannerist, style, segmental, arches, are, often, used, in, arcades, supported, on, piers, or, columns, with, capitals, there, may, be, a, section, of, entablature, between, the, capital, and, the, springing, of, the, arch, alberti, was, one, of, the, first, to, use, the, arch, on, a, monumental, scale, at, the, basilica, of, sant, andrea, mantua, vaults, do, not, have, ribs, they, are, semi, circular, or, segmental, and, on, a, square, plan, unlike, the, gothic, vault, which, is, frequently, rectangular, the, barrel, vault, is, returned, to, architectural, vocabulary, as, at, st, andrea, in, mantua, the, dome, is, used, frequently, both, as, a, very, large, structural, feature, that, is, visible, from, the, exterior, and, also, as, a, means, of, roofing, smaller, spaces, where, they, are, only, visible, internally, after, the, success, of, the, dome, in, brunelleschi, s, design, for, florence, cathedral, and, its, use, in, bramante, s, plan, for, st, peter, s, basilica, 1506, in, rome, the, dome, became, an, indispensable, element, in, church, architecture, and, later, even, for, secular, architecture, such, as, palladio, s, villa, rotonda, roofs, are, fitted, with, flat, or, coffered, ceilings, they, are, not, left, open, as, in, medieval, architecture, they, are, frequently, painted, or, decorated, doors, usually, have, square, lintels, they, may, be, set, with, in, an, arch, or, surmounted, by, a, triangular, or, segmental, pediment, openings, that, do, not, have, doors, are, usually, arched, and, frequently, have, a, large, or, decorative, keystone, windows, may, be, paired, and, set, within, a, semi, circular, arch, they, may, have, square, lintels, and, triangular, or, segmental, pediments, which, are, often, used, alternately, emblematic, in, this, respect, is, the, palazzo, farnese, in, rome, begun, in, 1517, in, the, mannerist, period, the, palladian, arch, was, employed, using, a, motif, of, a, high, semi, circular, topped, opening, flanked, with, two, lower, square, topped, openings, windows, are, used, to, bring, light, into, the, building, and, in, domestic, architecture, to, give, views, stained, glass, although, sometimes, present, is, not, a, feature, external, walls, are, generally, constructed, of, brick, rendered, or, faced, with, stone, in, highly, finished, ashlar, masonry, laid, in, straight, courses, the, corners, of, buildings, are, often, emphasized, by, rusticated, quoins, basements, and, ground, floors, were, often, rusticated, as, at, the, palazzo, medici, riccardi, 1444, 1460, in, florence, internal, walls, are, smoothly, plastered, and, surfaced, with, lime, wash, for, more, formal, spaces, internal, surfaces, are, decorated, with, frescoes, courses, mouldings, and, all, decorative, details, are, carved, with, great, precision, studying, and, mastering, the, details, of, the, ancient, romans, was, one, of, the, important, aspects, of, renaissance, theory, the, different, orders, each, required, different, sets, of, details, some, architects, were, stricter, in, their, use, of, classical, details, than, others, but, there, was, also, a, good, deal, of, innovation, in, solving, problems, especially, at, corners, mouldings, stand, out, around, doors, and, windows, rather, than, being, recessed, as, in, gothic, architecture, sculptured, figures, may, be, set, in, niches, or, placed, on, plinths, they, are, not, integral, to, the, building, as, in, medieval, architecture, the, leading, architects, of, the, early, renaissance, or, quattrocento, were, filippo, brunelleschi, michelozzo, and, leon, battista, alberti, the, person, generally, credited, with, bringing, about, the, renaissance, view, of, architecture, is, filippo, brunelleschi, 1377, 1446, the, underlying, feature, of, the, work, of, brunelleschi, was, order, in, the, early, 15th, century, brunelleschi, began, to, look, at, the, world, to, see, what, the, rules, were, that, governed, one, s, way, of, seeing, he, observed, that, the, way, one, sees, regular, structures, such, as, the, florence, baptistery, and, the, tiled, pavement, surrounding, it, follows, a, mathematical, order, linear, perspective, the, buildings, remaining, among, the, ruins, of, ancient, rome, appeared, to, respect, a, simple, mathematical, order, in, the, way, that, gothic, buildings, did, not, one, incontrovertible, rule, governed, all, ancient, roman, architecture, a, semi, circular, arch, is, exactly, twice, as, wide, as, it, is, high, a, fixed, proportion, with, implications, of, such, magnitude, occurred, nowhere, in, gothic, architecture, a, gothic, pointed, arch, could, be, extended, upwards, or, flattened, to, any, proportion, that, suited, the, location, arches, of, differing, angles, frequently, occurred, within, the, same, structure, no, set, rules, of, proportion, applied, from, the, observation, of, the, architecture, of, rome, came, a, desire, for, symmetry, and, careful, proportion, in, which, the, form, and, composition, of, the, building, as, a, whole, and, all, its, subsidiary, details, have, fixed, relationships, each, section, in, proportion, to, the, next, and, the, architectural, features, serving, to, define, exactly, what, those, rules, of, proportion, are, brunelleschi, gained, the, support, of, a, number, of, wealthy, florentine, patrons, including, the, silk, guild, and, cosimo, de, medici, brunelleschi, s, first, major, architectural, commission, was, for, the, enormous, brick, dome, which, covers, the, central, space, of, florence, s, cathedral, designed, by, arnolfo, di, cambio, in, the, 14th, century, but, left, unroofed, while, often, described, as, the, first, building, of, the, renaissance, brunelleschi, s, daring, design, utilises, the, pointed, gothic, arch, and, gothic, ribs, that, were, apparently, planned, by, arnolfo, it, seems, certain, however, that, while, stylistically, gothic, in, keeping, with, the, building, it, surmounts, the, dome, is, in, fact, structurally, influenced, by, the, great, dome, of, ancient, rome, which, brunelleschi, could, hardly, have, ignored, in, seeking, a, solution, this, is, the, dome, of, the, pantheon, a, circular, temple, now, a, church, inside, the, pantheon, s, single, shell, concrete, dome, is, coffering, which, greatly, decreases, the, weight, the, vertical, partitions, of, the, coffering, effectively, serve, as, ribs, although, this, feature, does, not, dominate, visually, at, the, apex, of, the, pantheon, s, dome, is, an, opening, 8, meters, across, brunelleschi, was, aware, that, a, dome, of, enormous, proportion, could, in, fact, be, engineered, without, a, keystone, the, dome, in, florence, is, supported, by, the, eight, large, ribs, and, sixteen, more, internal, ones, holding, a, brick, shell, with, the, bricks, arranged, in, a, herringbone, manner, although, the, techniques, employed, are, different, in, practice, both, domes, comprise, a, thick, network, of, ribs, supporting, very, much, lighter, and, thinner, infilling, and, both, have, a, large, opening, at, the, top, the, new, architectural, philosophy, of, the, renaissance, is, best, demonstrated, in, the, churches, of, san, lorenzo, and, santo, spirito, florence, designed, by, brunelleschi, in, about, 1425, and, 1428, respectively, both, have, the, shape, of, the, latin, cross, each, has, a, modular, plan, each, portion, being, a, multiple, of, the, square, bay, of, the, aisle, this, same, formula, controlled, also, the, vertical, dimensions, in, the, case, of, santo, spirito, which, is, entirely, regular, in, plan, transepts, and, chancel, are, identical, while, the, nave, is, an, extended, version, of, these, in, 1434, brunelleschi, designed, the, first, renaissance, centrally, planned, building, santa, maria, degli, angeli, florence, it, is, composed, of, a, central, octagon, surrounded, by, a, circuit, of, eight, smaller, chapels, from, this, date, onwards, numerous, churches, were, built, in, variations, of, these, designs, michelozzo, michelozzi, 1396, 1472, was, another, architect, under, patronage, of, the, medici, family, his, most, famous, work, being, the, palazzo, medici, riccardi, which, he, was, commissioned, to, design, for, cosimo, de, medici, in, 1444, a, decade, later, he, built, the, villa, medici, fiesole, among, his, other, works, for, cosimo, are, the, library, at, the, convent, of, san, marco, florence, he, went, into, exile, in, venice, for, a, time, with, his, patron, he, was, one, of, the, first, architects, to, work, in, the, renaissance, style, outside, italy, building, a, palace, at, dubrovnik, the, palazzo, medici, riccardi, is, classical, in, the, details, of, its, pedimented, windows, and, recessed, doors, but, unlike, the, works, of, brunelleschi, and, alberti, there, are, no, classical, orders, of, columns, in, evidence, instead, michelozzo, has, respected, the, florentine, liking, for, rusticated, stone, he, has, seemingly, created, three, orders, out, of, the, three, defined, rusticated, levels, the, whole, being, surmounted, by, an, enormous, roman, style, cornice, which, juts, out, over, the, street, by, 2, 5, meters, leon, battista, alberti, born, in, genoa, 1402, 1472, was, an, important, humanist, theoretician, and, designer, whose, book, on, architecture, de, re, aedificatoria, was, to, have, lasting, effect, an, aspect, of, renaissance, humanism, was, an, emphasis, of, the, anatomy, of, nature, in, particular, the, human, form, a, science, first, studied, by, the, ancient, greeks, humanism, made, man, the, measure, of, things, alberti, perceived, the, architect, as, a, person, with, great, social, responsibilities, he, designed, a, number, of, buildings, but, unlike, brunelleschi, he, did, not, see, himself, as, a, builder, in, a, practical, sense, and, so, left, the, supervision, of, the, work, to, others, miraculously, one, of, his, greatest, designs, that, of, the, basilica, of, sant, andrea, mantua, was, brought, to, completion, with, its, character, essentially, intact, not, so, the, church, of, san, francesco, in, rimini, a, rebuilding, of, a, gothic, structure, which, like, sant, andrea, was, to, have, a, fa, ade, reminiscent, of, a, roman, triumphal, arch, this, was, left, sadly, incomplete, sant, andrea, is, an, extremely, dynamic, building, both, without, and, within, its, triumphal, fa, ade, is, marked, by, extreme, contrasts, the, projection, of, the, order, of, pilasters, that, define, the, architectural, elements, but, are, essentially, non, functional, is, very, shallow, this, contrasts, with, the, gaping, deeply, recessed, arch, which, makes, a, huge, portico, before, the, main, door, the, size, of, this, arch, is, in, direct, contrast, to, the, two, low, square, topped, openings, that, frame, it, the, light, and, shade, play, dramatically, over, the, surface, of, the, building, because, of, the, shallowness, of, its, mouldings, and, the, depth, of, its, porch, in, the, interior, alberti, has, dispensed, with, the, traditional, nave, and, aisles, instead, there, is, a, slow, and, majestic, progression, of, alternating, tall, arches, and, low, square, doorways, repeating, the, triumphal, arch, motif, of, the, fa, ade, two, of, alberti, s, best, known, buildings, are, in, florence, the, palazzo, rucellai, and, at, santa, maria, novella, for, the, palace, alberti, applied, the, classical, orders, of, columns, to, the, fa, ade, on, the, three, levels, 1446, 51, at, santa, maria, novella, he, was, commissioned, to, finish, the, decoration, of, the, fa, ade, he, completed, the, design, in, 1456, but, the, work, was, not, finished, until, 1470, the, lower, section, of, the, building, had, gothic, niches, and, typical, polychrome, marble, decoration, there, was, a, large, ocular, window, in, the, end, of, the, nave, which, had, to, be, taken, into, account, alberti, simply, respected, what, was, already, in, place, and, the, florentine, tradition, for, polychrome, that, was, well, established, at, the, baptistery, of, san, giovanni, the, most, revered, building, in, the, city, the, decoration, being, mainly, polychrome, marble, is, mostly, very, flat, in, nature, but, a, sort, of, order, is, established, by, the, regular, compartments, and, the, circular, motifs, which, repeat, the, shape, of, the, round, window, for, the, first, time, alberti, linked, the, lower, roofs, of, the, aisles, to, nave, using, two, large, scrolls, these, were, to, become, a, standard, renaissance, device, for, solving, the, problem, of, different, roof, heights, and, bridge, the, space, between, horizontal, and, vertical, surfaces, in, the, late, 15th, century, and, early, 16th, century, architects, such, as, bramante, antonio, da, sangallo, the, younger, and, others, showed, a, mastery, of, the, revived, style, and, ability, to, apply, it, to, buildings, such, as, churches, and, city, palazzo, which, were, quite, different, from, the, structures, of, ancient, times, the, style, became, more, decorated, and, ornamental, statuary, domes, and, cupolas, becoming, very, evident, the, architectural, period, is, known, as, the, high, renaissance, and, coincides, with, the, age, of, leonardo, michelangelo, and, raphael, donato, bramante, 1444, 1514, was, born, in, urbino, and, turned, from, painting, to, architecture, finding, his, first, important, patronage, under, ludovico, sforza, duke, of, milan, for, whom, he, produced, a, number, of, buildings, over, 20, years, after, the, fall, of, milan, to, the, french, in, 1499, bramante, travelled, to, rome, where, he, achieved, great, success, under, papal, patronage, bramante, s, finest, architectural, achievement, in, milan, is, his, addition, of, crossing, and, choir, to, the, abbey, church, of, santa, maria, delle, grazie, milan, this, is, a, brick, structure, the, form, of, which, owes, much, to, the, northern, italian, tradition, of, square, domed, baptisteries, the, new, building, is, almost, centrally, planned, except, that, because, of, the, site, the, chancel, extends, further, than, the, transept, arms, the, hemispherical, dome, of, approximately, 20, metres, across, rises, up, hidden, inside, an, octagonal, drum, pierced, at, the, upper, level, with, arched, classical, openings, the, whole, exterior, has, delineated, details, decorated, with, the, local, terracotta, ornamentation, from, 1488, to, 1492, he, worked, for, ascanio, sforza, on, pavia, cathedral, on, which, he, imposed, a, central, plan, scheme, and, built, some, apses, and, the, crypt, inspired, by, the, thermal, baths, of, the, roman, age, in, rome, bramante, created, what, has, been, described, as, a, perfect, architectural, gem, the, tempietto, in, the, cloister, of, san, pietro, in, montorio, this, small, circular, temple, marks, the, spot, where, st, peter, was, martyred, and, is, thus, the, most, sacred, site, in, rome, the, building, adapts, the, style, apparent, in, the, remains, of, the, temple, of, vesta, the, most, sacred, site, of, ancient, rome, it, is, enclosed, by, and, in, spatial, contrast, with, the, cloister, which, surrounds, it, as, approached, from, the, cloister, as, in, the, picture, above, it, is, seen, framed, by, an, arch, and, columns, the, shape, of, which, are, echoed, in, its, free, standing, form, bramante, went, on, to, work, on, the, apostolic, palace, where, he, designed, the, cortile, del, belvedere, in, 1506, his, design, for, pope, julius, ii, s, rebuilding, of, st, peter, s, basilica, was, selected, and, the, foundation, stone, laid, after, bramante, s, death, and, many, changes, of, plan, michelangelo, as, chief, architect, reverted, to, something, closer, to, bramante, s, original, proposal, antonio, da, sangallo, the, younger, 1485, 1546, was, one, of, a, family, of, military, engineers, his, uncle, giuliano, da, sangallo, was, one, of, those, who, submitted, a, plan, for, the, rebuilding, of, st, peter, s, and, was, briefly, a, co, director, of, the, project, with, raphael, antonio, da, sangallo, also, submitted, a, plan, for, st, peter, s, and, became, the, chief, architect, after, the, death, of, raphael, to, be, succeeded, himself, by, michelangelo, his, fame, does, not, rest, upon, his, association, with, st, peter, s, but, in, his, building, of, the, farnese, palace, the, grandest, palace, of, this, period, started, in, 1530, the, impression, of, grandness, lies, in, part, in, its, sheer, size, 56, m, long, by, 29, 5, meters, high, and, in, its, lofty, location, overlooking, a, broad, piazza, unusually, for, such, a, large, and, luxurious, house, of, the, time, it, was, built, principally, of, stuccoed, brick, rather, than, of, stone, against, the, smooth, pink, washed, walls, the, stone, quoins, of, the, corners, the, massive, rusticated, portal, and, the, repetition, of, finely, detailed, windows, produce, an, elegant, effect, the, upper, of, the, three, equally, sized, floors, was, added, by, michelangelo, the, travertine, for, its, architectural, details, came, not, from, a, quarry, but, from, the, colosseum, raphael, 1483, 1520, born, in, urbino, trained, under, perugino, in, perugia, before, moving, to, florence, was, for, a, time, the, chief, architect, for, st, peter, s, working, in, conjunction, with, antonio, sangallo, he, also, designed, a, number, of, buildings, most, of, which, were, finished, by, others, his, single, most, influential, work, is, the, palazzo, pandolfini, in, florence, with, its, two, stories, of, strongly, articulated, windows, of, a, tabernacle, type, each, set, around, with, ordered, pilasters, cornice, and, alternate, arched, and, triangular, pediments, mannerism, in, architecture, was, marked, by, widely, diverging, tendencies, in, the, work, of, michelangelo, giulio, romano, baldassare, peruzzi, and, andrea, palladio, that, led, to, the, baroque, style, in, which, the, same, architectural, vocabulary, was, used, for, very, different, rhetoric, baldassare, peruzzi, 1481, 1536, was, an, architect, born, in, siena, but, working, in, rome, whose, work, bridges, the, high, renaissance, and, the, mannerist, period, his, villa, farnesina, of, 1509, is, a, very, regular, monumental, cube, of, two, equal, stories, the, bays, being, strongly, articulated, by, orders, of, pilasters, the, building, is, unusual, for, its, frescoed, walls, peruzzi, s, most, famous, work, is, the, palazzo, massimo, alle, colonne, in, rome, the, unusual, features, of, this, building, are, that, its, fa, ade, curves, gently, around, a, curving, street, it, has, in, its, ground, floor, a, dark, central, portico, running, parallel, to, the, street, but, as, a, semi, enclosed, space, rather, than, an, open, loggia, above, this, rise, three, undifferentiated, floors, the, upper, two, with, identical, small, horizontal, windows, in, thin, flat, frames, which, contrast, strangely, with, the, deep, porch, which, has, served, from, the, time, of, its, construction, as, a, refuge, to, the, city, s, poor, giulio, romano, 1499, 1546, was, a, pupil, of, raphael, assisting, him, on, various, works, for, the, vatican, romano, was, also, a, highly, inventive, designer, working, for, federico, ii, gonzaga, at, mantua, on, the, palazzo, te, 1524, 1534, a, project, which, combined, his, skills, as, architect, sculptor, and, painter, in, this, work, incorporating, garden, grottoes, and, extensive, frescoes, he, uses, illusionistic, effects, surprising, combinations, of, architectural, form, and, texture, and, the, frequent, use, of, features, that, seem, somewhat, disproportionate, or, out, of, alignment, the, total, effect, is, eerie, and, disturbing, ilan, rachum, cites, romano, as, one, of, the, first, promoters, of, mannerism, michelangelo, buonarroti, 1475, 1564, was, one, of, the, creative, giants, whose, achievements, mark, the, high, renaissance, he, excelled, in, each, of, the, fields, of, painting, sculpture, and, architecture, and, his, achievements, brought, about, significant, changes, in, each, area, his, architectural, fame, lies, chiefly, in, two, buildings, the, interiors, of, the, laurentian, library, and, its, lobby, at, the, monastery, of, san, lorenzo, in, florence, and, st, peter, s, basilica, in, rome, st, peter, s, was, the, greatest, creation, of, the, renaissance, and, a, great, number, of, architects, contributed, their, skills, to, it, but, at, its, completion, there, was, more, of, michelangelo, s, design, than, of, any, other, architect, before, or, after, him, the, plan, that, was, accepted, at, the, laying, of, the, foundation, stone, in, 1506, was, that, by, bramante, various, changes, in, plan, occurred, in, the, series, of, architects, that, succeeded, him, but, michelangelo, when, he, took, over, the, project, in, 1546, reverted, to, bramante, s, greek, cross, plan, and, redesigned, the, piers, the, walls, and, the, dome, giving, the, lower, weight, bearing, members, massive, proportions, and, eliminating, the, encircling, aisles, from, the, chancel, and, identical, transept, arms, helen, gardner, says, michelangelo, with, a, few, strokes, of, the, pen, converted, its, snowflake, complexity, into, a, massive, cohesive, unity, michelangelo, s, dome, was, a, masterpiece, of, design, using, two, masonry, shells, one, within, the, other, and, crowned, by, a, massive, roof, lantern, supported, as, at, florence, on, ribs, for, the, exterior, of, the, building, he, designed, a, giant, order, which, defines, every, external, bay, the, whole, lot, being, held, together, by, a, wide, cornice, which, runs, unbroken, like, a, rippling, ribbon, around, the, entire, building, there, is, a, wooden, model, of, the, dome, showing, its, outer, shell, as, hemispherical, when, michelangelo, died, in, 1564, the, building, had, reached, the, height, of, the, drum, the, architect, who, succeeded, michelangelo, was, giacomo, della, porta, the, dome, as, built, has, a, much, steeper, projection, than, the, dome, of, the, model, it, is, generally, presumed, that, it, was, della, porta, who, made, this, change, to, the, design, to, lessen, the, outward, thrust, but, in, fact, it, is, unknown, who, it, was, that, made, this, change, and, it, is, equally, possible, and, a, stylistic, likelihood, that, the, person, who, decided, upon, the, more, dynamic, outline, was, michelangelo, himself, at, some, time, during, the, years, that, he, supervised, the, project, michelangelo, was, at, his, most, mannerist, in, the, design, of, the, vestibule, of, the, laurentian, library, also, built, by, him, to, house, the, medici, collection, of, books, at, the, convent, of, san, lorenzo, florence, the, same, san, lorenzo, s, at, which, brunelleschi, had, recast, church, architecture, into, a, classical, mold, and, established, clear, formula, for, the, use, of, classical, orders, and, their, various, components, michelangelo, takes, all, brunelleschi, s, components, and, bends, them, to, his, will, the, library, is, upstairs, it, is, a, long, low, building, with, an, ornate, wooden, ceiling, a, matching, floor, and, crowded, with, corrals, finished, by, his, successors, to, michelangelo, s, design, but, it, is, a, light, room, the, natural, lighting, streaming, through, a, long, row, of, windows, that, appear, positively, crammed, between, the, order, of, pilasters, that, march, along, the, wall, the, vestibule, on, the, other, hand, is, tall, taller, than, it, is, wide, and, is, crowded, by, a, large, staircase, that, pours, out, of, the, library, in, what, nikolaus, pevsner, refers, to, as, a, flow, of, lava, and, bursts, in, three, directions, when, it, meets, the, balustrade, of, the, landing, it, is, an, intimidating, staircase, made, all, the, more, so, because, the, rise, of, the, stairs, at, the, center, is, steeper, than, at, the, two, sides, fitting, only, eight, steps, into, the, space, of, nine, the, space, is, crowded, and, it, is, to, be, expected, that, the, wall, spaces, would, be, divided, by, pilasters, of, low, projection, but, michelangelo, has, chosen, to, use, paired, columns, which, instead, of, standing, out, boldly, from, the, wall, he, has, sunk, deep, into, recesses, within, the, wall, itself, in, the, basilica, di, san, lorenzo, nearby, brunelleschi, used, little, scrolling, console, brackets, to, break, the, strongly, horizontal, line, of, the, course, above, the, arcade, michelangelo, has, borrowed, brunelleschi, s, motifs, and, stood, each, pair, of, sunken, columns, on, a, pair, of, twin, console, brackets, pevsner, says, the, laurenziana, reveals, mannerism, in, its, most, sublime, architectural, form, giacomo, della, porta, c, 1533, 1602, was, famous, as, the, architect, who, made, the, dome, of, st, peter, s, basilica, a, reality, the, change, in, outline, between, the, dome, as, it, appears, in, the, model, and, the, dome, as, it, was, built, has, brought, about, speculation, as, to, whether, the, changes, originated, with, della, porta, or, with, michelangelo, himself, della, porta, spent, nearly, all, his, working, life, in, rome, designing, villas, palazzi, and, churches, in, the, mannerist, style, one, of, his, most, famous, works, is, the, fa, ade, of, the, church, of, the, ges, a, project, that, he, inherited, from, his, teacher, jacopo, barozzi, da, vignola, most, characteristics, of, the, original, design, are, maintained, subtly, transformed, to, give, more, weight, to, the, central, section, where, della, porta, uses, among, other, motifs, a, low, triangular, pediment, overlaid, on, a, segmental, one, above, the, main, door, the, upper, storey, and, its, pediment, give, the, impression, of, compressing, the, lower, one, the, center, section, like, that, of, sant, andrea, at, mantua, is, based, on, the, triumphal, arch, but, has, two, clear, horizontal, divisions, like, santa, maria, novella, see, alberti, above, the, problem, of, linking, the, aisles, to, the, nave, is, solved, using, alberti, s, scrolls, in, contrast, to, vignola, s, solution, which, provided, much, smaller, brackets, and, four, statues, to, stand, above, the, paired, pilasters, visually, weighing, down, the, corners, of, the, building, the, influence, of, the, design, may, be, seen, in, baroque, churches, throughout, europe, andrea, palladio, 1508, 80, the, most, influential, architect, of, the, whole, renaissance, was, as, a, stonemason, introduced, to, humanism, by, the, poet, giangiorgio, trissino, his, first, major, architectural, commission, was, the, rebuilding, of, the, basilica, palladiana, at, vicenza, in, the, veneto, where, he, was, to, work, most, of, his, life, palladio, was, to, transform, the, architectural, style, of, both, palaces, and, churches, by, taking, a, different, perspective, on, the, notion, of, classicism, while, the, architects, of, florence, and, rome, looked, to, structures, like, the, colosseum, and, the, arch, of, constantine, to, provide, formulae, palladio, looked, to, classical, temples, with, their, simple, peristyle, form, when, he, used, the, triumphal, arch, motif, of, a, large, arched, opening, with, lower, square, topped, opening, on, either, side, he, invariably, applied, it, on, a, small, scale, such, as, windows, rather, than, on, a, large, scale, as, alberti, used, it, at, sant, andrea, s, this, ancient, roman, motif, is, often, referred, to, as, the, palladian, arch, the, best, known, of, palladio, s, domestic, buildings, is, villa, capra, otherwise, known, as, la, rotonda, a, centrally, planned, house, with, a, domed, central, hall, and, four, identical, fa, ades, each, with, a, temple, like, portico, like, that, of, the, pantheon, rome, at, the, villa, cornaro, the, projecting, portico, of, the, north, fa, ade, and, recessed, loggia, of, the, garden, fa, ade, are, of, two, ordered, stories, the, upper, forming, a, balcony, like, alberti, della, porta, and, others, in, the, designing, of, a, church, fa, ade, palladio, was, confronted, by, the, problem, of, visually, linking, the, aisles, to, the, nave, while, maintaining, and, defining, the, structure, of, the, building, palladio, s, solution, was, entirely, different, from, that, employed, by, della, porta, at, the, church, of, san, giorgio, maggiore, in, venice, he, overlays, a, tall, temple, its, columns, raised, on, high, plinths, over, another, low, wide, temple, fa, ade, its, columns, rising, from, the, basements, and, its, narrow, lintel, and, pilasters, appearing, behind, the, giant, order, of, the, central, nave, in, italy, there, appears, to, be, a, seamless, progression, from, early, renaissance, architecture, through, the, high, renaissance, and, mannerism, to, the, baroque, style, pevsner, comments, about, the, vestibule, of, the, laurentian, library, that, it, has, often, been, said, that, the, motifs, of, the, walls, show, michelangelo, as, the, father, of, the, baroque, while, continuity, may, be, the, case, in, italy, it, was, not, necessarily, the, case, elsewhere, the, adoption, of, the, renaissance, style, of, architecture, was, slower, in, some, areas, than, in, others, as, may, be, seen, in, england, for, example, indeed, as, pope, julius, ii, was, having, the, old, st, peter, s, basilica, demolished, to, make, way, for, the, new, henry, vii, of, england, was, adding, a, glorious, new, chapel, in, the, perpendicular, gothic, style, to, westminster, abbey, likewise, the, style, that, was, to, become, known, as, baroque, evolved, in, italy, in, the, early, 17th, century, at, about, the, time, that, the, first, fully, renaissance, buildings, were, constructed, at, greenwich, and, whitehall, in, england, after, a, prolonged, period, of, experimentation, with, classical, motifs, applied, to, local, architectural, forms, or, conversely, the, adoption, of, renaissance, structural, forms, in, the, broadest, sense, with, an, absence, of, the, formulae, that, governed, their, use, while, the, english, were, just, discovering, what, the, rules, of, classicism, were, the, italians, were, experimenting, with, methods, of, breaking, them, in, england, following, the, restoration, of, the, monarchy, in, 1660, the, architectural, climate, changed, and, taste, moved, in, the, direction, of, the, baroque, rather, than, evolving, as, it, did, in, italy, it, arrived, fully, fledged, in, a, similar, way, in, many, parts, of, europe, that, had, few, purely, classical, and, ordered, buildings, like, brunelleschi, s, santo, spirito, and, michelozzo, s, medici, riccardi, palace, baroque, architecture, appeared, almost, unheralded, on, the, heels, of, a, sort, of, proto, renaissance, local, style, the, spread, of, the, baroque, and, its, replacement, of, traditional, and, more, conservative, renaissance, architecture, was, particularly, apparent, in, the, building, of, churches, as, part, of, the, counter, reformation, the, 16th, century, saw, the, economic, and, political, ascendancy, of, france, spain, and, portugal, then, later, the, rise, of, england, poland, and, russia, and, the, dutch, republic, the, result, was, that, these, places, began, to, import, the, renaissance, style, as, indicators, of, their, new, cultural, position, this, also, meant, that, it, was, not, until, about, 1500, and, later, that, signs, of, renaissance, architectural, style, began, to, appear, outside, italy, though, italian, architects, were, highly, sought, after, such, as, sebastiano, serlio, in, france, aristotile, fioravanti, in, russia, and, francesco, fiorentino, in, poland, soon, non, italians, were, studying, italian, architecture, and, translating, it, into, their, own, idiom, these, included, philibert, de, l, orme, 1510, 1570, in, france, juan, bautista, de, toledo, died, 1567, in, spain, inigo, jones, 1573, 1652, in, england, and, elias, holl, 1573, 1646, in, germany, books, or, ornament, prints, with, engraved, illustrations, demonstrating, plans, and, ornament, were, very, important, in, spreading, renaissance, styles, in, northern, europe, with, among, the, most, important, authors, being, androuet, du, cerceau, in, france, and, hans, vredeman, de, vries, in, the, netherlands, and, wendel, dietterlin, author, of, architectura, 1593, 94, in, germany, the, renaissance, arrived, late, in, what, is, today, estonia, latvia, and, lithuania, the, so, called, baltic, states, and, did, not, make, a, great, imprint, architecturally, it, was, a, politically, tumultuous, time, marked, by, the, decline, of, the, state, of, the, teutonic, order, and, the, livonian, war, in, estonia, artistic, influences, came, from, dutch, swedish, and, polish, sources, the, building, of, the, brotherhood, of, the, blackheads, in, tallinn, with, a, fa, ade, designed, by, arent, passer, is, the, only, truly, renaissance, building, in, the, country, that, has, survived, more, or, less, intact, significantly, for, these, troubled, times, the, only, other, examples, are, purely, military, buildings, such, as, the, fat, margaret, cannon, tower, also, in, tallinn, latvian, renaissance, architecture, was, influenced, by, polish, lithuanian, and, dutch, style, with, mannerism, following, from, gothic, without, intermediaries, st, john, s, church, in, the, latvian, capital, of, riga, is, an, example, of, an, earlier, gothic, church, which, was, reconstructed, in, 1587, 89, by, the, dutch, architect, gert, freze, joris, phraeze, the, prime, example, of, renaissance, architecture, in, latvia, is, the, heavily, decorated, house, of, the, blackheads, rebuilt, from, an, earlier, medieval, structure, into, its, present, mannerist, forms, as, late, as, 1619, 25, by, the, architects, a, and, l, jansen, it, was, destroyed, during, world, war, ii, and, rebuilt, during, the, 1990s, lithuania, meanwhile, formed, a, large, dual,

with, its, incorporated, lands, especially, moravia, thus, ranked, among, the, areas, of, the, holy, roman, empire, with, the, earliest, known, examples, of, the, renaissance, architecture, the, lands, of, the, bohemian, crown, were, never, part, of, the, ancient, roman, empire, thus, they, missed, their, own, ancient, classical, heritage, and, had, to, be, dependent, on, the, primarily, italian, models, as, well, as, in, other, central, european, countries, the, gothic, style, kept, its, position, especially, in, the, church, architecture, the, traditional, gothic, architecture, was, considered, timeless, and, therefore, able, to, express, the, sacredness, the, renaissance, architecture, coexisted, with, the, gothic, style, in, bohemia, and, moravia, until, the, late, 16th, century, e, g, the, residential, part, of, a, palace, was, built, in, the, modern, renaissance, style, but, its, chapel, was, designed, with, gothic, elements, the, fa, ades, of, czech, renaissance,

in, the, way, that, was, usual, in, wooden, constructions, in, 1477, the, work, was, unfinished, and, continued, under, niccol, di, giovanni, fiorentino, who, respected, the, mode, of, construction, and, the, plan, of, the, former, architect, but, continued, the, work, which, includes, the, upper, windows, the, vaults, and, the, dome, in, the, renaissance, style, the, combination, of, a, high,

manifest, itself, in, large, square, tall, prodigy, houses, such, as, longleat, house, the, first, great, exponent, of, classicizing, italian, renaissance, architecture, in, england, was, inigo,

immediately, began, to, design, such, buildings, as, the, queen, s, house, at, greenwich, in, 1616, and, the, banqueting, house, whitehall, three, years, later, these, works, with, their, clean, lines, and, symmetry, were, revolutionary, in, a, country, still, enamoured, with, mullion, windows, crenellations, and, turrets, during, the, early, years, of, the, 16th, century, the, french, were,

of, building, was, carried, and, many, renaissance, ch, teaux, appeared, at, this, time, the, earliest, example, being, the, ch, teau, d, amboise, c, 1495, in, which, leonardo, da, vinci, spent, his,

completely, preserved, work, of, hungarian, renaissance, architecture, is, the, bak, cz, chapel, commissioned, by, the, hungarian, cardinal, tam, s, bak, cz, now, part, of, the, esztergom, basilica, as, in, painting, renaissance, architecture, took, some, time, to, reach, the, habsburg, netherlands, and, did, not, entirely, supplant, the, gothic, elements, an, architect, directly, influenced, by, the, italian, masters, was, cornelis, floris, de, vriendt, who, designed, antwerp, city, hall, finished, in, 1564, the, style, is, sometimes, called, the, flemish, italian, renaissance, style, and,

profile, in, strapwork, resembling, leatherwork, a, stylistic, feature, originating, in, the, school, of, fontainebleau, this, feature, was, exported, to, england, polish, renaissance, architecture, is, divided, into, three, periods, the, first, period, 1500, 50, is, the, so, called, italian, as, most, of, renaissance, buildings, of, this, time, were, designed, by, italian, architects, mainly, from, florence, including, francesco, fiorentino, and, bartolomeo, berrecci, renowned, architects, from, southern, europe, became, sought, after, during, the, reign, of, sigismund, i, the, old, and,

architecture, became, more, common, with, the, beginnings, of, mannerist, and, under, the, influence, of, the, netherlands, particularly, in, northern, poland, and, pomerania, but, also, in, parts, of, lesser, poland, buildings, of, this, kind, include, the, cloth, hall, in, krak, w, and, city, halls, of, tarn, w, and, sandomierz, the, most, famous, example, is, the, 16th, century, pozna, town, hall, designed, by, giovanni, battista, di, quadro, in, the, third, period, 1600, 50, the, rising, power, of, sponsored, jesuits, and, counter, reformation, gave, impetus, to, the, development, of, mannerist, architecture, and, baroque, most, notable, example, of, this, period, is, kalwaria, zebrzydowska, park, mannerist, architectural, and, park, landscape, complex, and, pilgrimage, park, which, consists, basilica, of, st, mary, and, 42, chapels, modelled, and, named, after, the, places, in, jerusalem, and, holy, land, this, is, an, unesco, world, heritage, site, another, great, example, from, this, period, is, krasiczyn, castle, which, is, an, palazzo, in, fortezza, with, a, unique, sgraffito, wall, decorations, whose, total, area, is, about, 7000, square, meters, the, adoption, of, the, renaissance, style, in, portugal, was, gradual, the, so, called, manueline, style, c, 1490, 1535, married, renaissance, elements, to, gothic, structures, with, the, superficial, application, of, exuberant, ornament, similar, to, the, isabelline, gothic, of, spain, examples, of, manueline, include, the, bel, m, tower, a, defensive, building, of, gothic, form, decorated, with,

prince, ivan, iii, introduced, renaissance, architecture, to, russia, by, inviting, a, number, of, architects, from, italy, who, brought, new, construction, techniques, and, some, renaissance, style, elements, with, them, while, in, general, following, the, traditional, designs, of, the, russian, architecture, in, 1475, the, bolognese, architect, aristotele, fioravanti, came, to, rebuild, the,

to, the, construction, of, the, kremlin, walls, and, towers, the, small, banqueting, hall, of, the, russian, tsars, called, the, palace, of, facets, because, of, its, facetted, upper, story, is, the, work, of, two, italians, marco, ruffo, and, pietro, solario, and, shows, a, more, italian, style, in, 1505, an, italian, known, in, russia, as, aleviz, novyi, built, twelve, churches, for, ivan, iii, including, the, cathedral, of, the, archangel, a, building, remarkable, for, the, successful, blending, of, russian, tradition, orthodox, requirements, and, renaissance, style, the, renaissance, architecture, that, found, its, way, to, scandinavia, was, influenced, by, the, flemish, architecture, and, included, high, gables, and, a, castle, air, as, demonstrated, in, the, architecture, of, frederiksborg, palace, consequently, much, of, the, neo, renaissance, to, be, found, in, the, scandinavian, countries, is, derived, from, this, source, in, denmark, renaissance, architecture, thrived, during, the, reigns, of, frederick, ii, and, especially, christian, iv, inspired, by, the, french, castles, of, the, times, flemish, architects, designed, masterpieces, such, as, kronborg, castle, in,

seizure, of, power, and, the, onset, of, the, protestant, reformation, church, construction, and, aristocratic, building, projects, came, to, a, near, standstill, during, this, time, period, several, magnificent, so, called, vasa, castles, appeared, they, were, erected, at, strategic, locations, to, control, the, country, as, well, as, to, accommodate, the, travelling, royal, court, gripsholm, castle, kalmar, castle, and, vadstena, castle, are, known, for, their, fusion, of, medieval, elements, with, renaissance, architecture, the, architecture, of, norway, was, influenced, partly, by, the, occurrence, of, the, plague, during, the, renaissance, era, after, the, black, death, monumental, construction, in, norway, came, to, a, standstill, there, are, few, examples, of, renaissance, architecture, in, norway, the, most, prominent, being, renovations, to, the, medieval, rosenkrantz, tower, in, bergen, barony, rosendal, in, hardanger, and, the, contemporary, austrat, manor, near, trondheim, and, parts, of, akershus, fortress, there, is, little, evidence, of, renaissance, influence, in, finnish, architecture, in, spain, renaissance, began, to, be, grafted, to, gothic, forms, in, the, last, decades, of, the, 15th, century, the, new, style, is, called, plateresque, because, of, the, extremely, decorated, fa, ade, that, brought, to, the, mind, the, decorative, motifs, of, the, intricately, detailed, work, of, silversmiths, the, plateros, classical, orders, and, candelabra, motifs, a, candelieri, combined, freely, as, decades, passed, the, gothic, influence, disappeared, and, the, research, of, an, orthodox, classicism, reached, high, levels, although, plateresco, is, a, commonly, used, term, to, define, most, of, the, architectural, production, of, the, late, 15th, and, first, half, of, 16th, century, some, architects, acquired, a, more, sober, personal, style, like, diego, siloe, and, andr, s, de, vandelvira, in, andalusia, and, alonso, de, covarrubias, and, rodrigo, gil, de, honta, n, in, castile, this, phase, of, spanish, renaissance, is, called, purism, from, the, mid, sixteenth, century, under, such, architects, as, pedro, machuca, juan, bautista, de, toledo, and, juan, de, herrera, there, was, a, closer, adherence, to, the, art, of, ancient, rome, sometimes, anticipating, mannerism, examples, of, which, include, the, palace, of, charles, v, in, granada, and, el, escorial, this, herrerian, style, or, arquitectura, herreriana, of, architecture, was, developed, during, the, last, third, of, the, 16th, century, under, the, reign, of, philip, ii, 1556, 1598, and, continued, in, force, in, the, 17th, century, but, transformed, by, the, baroque, style, of, the, time, renaissance, architecture, spread, to, colonial, bolivia, with, examples, being, the, church, of, curahuara, de, carangas, built, between, 1587, and, 1608, known, as, the, sistine, chapel, of, the, andes, by, the, bolivians, for, its, rich, mannerist, decoration, in, its, interior, and, the, basilica, of, our, lady, of, copacabana, built, between, 1601, and, 1619, designed, by, the, spanish, architect, francisco, jim, nez, de, siguenza, the, best, known, examples, of, the, renaissance, architecture, in, colonial, brazil, are, the, mannerist, cathedral, basilica, of, salvador, built, between, 1657, and, 1746, and, the, franciscan, convent, of, santo, ant, nio, in, jo, o, pessoa, built, between, 1634, and, 1779, the, house, of, the, five, medallions, is, a, historic, house, built, in, 1540, located, in, santo, domingo, this, preserves, a, plateresque, renaissance, fa, ade, the, large, basilica, and, convent, of, san, francisco, quito, built, between, 1535, and, 1650, is, of, mannerist, renaissance, style, a, notable, example, of, renaissance, architecture, in, new, spain, is, the, cathedral, of, m, rida, yucat, n, one, of, the, oldest, cathedrals, in, the, americas, built, between, 1562, and, 1598, and, designed, by, pedro, de, aulestia, and, juan, miguel, de, ag, ero, several, of, the, churches, of, the, city, of, cusco, were, begun, during, the, renaissance, period, including, cusco, cathedral, 1539, many, others, are, baroque, in, style, many, styles, of, late, renaissance, and, mannerist, architecture, transitioned, fairly, easily, in, local, styles, of, baroque, architecture, in, other, areas, the, change, was, more, abrupt, baroque, and, neoclassical, architecture, dominated, the, later, 17th, and, the, 18th, century, in, most, areas, and, persisted, well, into, the, 19th, century, in, many, places, and, individual, buildings, during, the, 19th, century, there, was, a, conscious, revival, of, the, style, in, renaissance, revival, architecture, that, paralleled, the, gothic, revival, whereas, the, gothic, style, was, perceived, by, architectural, theorists, as, being, the, most, appropriate, style, for, church, building, the, renaissance, palazzo, was, a, good, model, for, urban, secular, buildings, requiring, an, appearance, of, dignity, and, reliability, such, as, banks, gentlemen, s, clubs, and, apartment, blocks, buildings, that, sought, to, impress, such, as, the, palais, garnier, were, often, of, a, more, mannerist, or, baroque, style, architects, of, factories, office, blocks, and, department, stores, continued, to, use, the, renaissance, palazzo, form, into, the, 20th, century, in, mediterranean, revival, style, architecture, with, an, italian, renaissance, emphasis, many, of, the, concepts, and, forms, of, renaissance, architecture, can, be, traced, through, subsequent, architectural, movements, from, renaissance, to, high, renaissance, to, mannerism, to, baroque, or, rococo, to, neo, classicism, and, to, eclecticism, while, renaissance, style, and, motifs, were, largely, purged, from, modernism, they, have, been, reasserted, in, some, postmodern, architecture, the, influence, of, renaissance, architecture, can, still, be, seen, in, many, of, the, modern, styles, and, rules, of, architecture, today
