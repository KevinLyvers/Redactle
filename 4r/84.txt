a, narrative, story, or, tale, is, any, account, of, a, series, of, related, events, or, experiences, whether, non, fictional, memoir, biography, news, report, documentary, travelogue, etc, or, fictional, fairy, tale, fable, legend, thriller, novel, etc, narratives, can, be, presented, through, a, sequence, of, written, or, spoken, words, through, still, or, moving, images, or, through, any, combination, of, these, the, word, derives, from, the, latin, verb, narrare, to, tell, which, is, derived, from, the, adjective, gnarus, knowing, or, skilled, the, formal, and, literary, process, of, constructing, a, narrative, narration, is, one, of, the, four, traditional, rhetorical, modes, of, discourse, along, with, argumentation, description, and, exposition, this, is, a, somewhat, distinct, usage, from, narration, in, the, narrower, sense, of, a, commentary, used, to, convey, a, story, many, additional, narrative, techniques, particularly, literary, ones, are, used, to, build, and, enhance, any, given, story, the, social, and, cultural, activity, of, sharing, narratives, is, called, storytelling, and, its, earliest, form, is, oral, storytelling, during, most, people, s, childhoods, these, narratives, are, used, to, guide, them, on, proper, behavior, history, formation, of, a, communal, identity, and, values, from, their, cultural, standpoint, as, studied, explicitly, in, anthropology, today, among, traditional, indigenous, peoples, with, regard, to, oral, tradition, narratives, consist, of, everyday, speech, where, the, performer, has, the, licence, to, recontextualise, the, story, to, a, particular, audience, often, to, a, younger, generation, and, are, contrasted, with, epics, which, consist, of, formal, speech, and, are, usually, learned, word, for, word, narrative, is, found, in, all, mediums, of, human, creativity, art, and, entertainment, including, speech, literature, theatre, music, and, song, comics, journalism, film, television, animation, and, video, video, games, radio, game, play, unstructured, recreation, and, performance, in, general, as, well, as, some, painting, sculpture, drawing, photography, and, other, visual, arts, as, long, as, a, sequence, of, events, is, presented, several, art, movements, such, as, modern, art, refuse, the, narrative, in, favor, of, the, abstract, and, conceptual, narrative, can, be, organized, into, a, number, of, thematic, or, formal, categories, nonfiction, such, as, creative, nonfiction, biography, journalism, transcript, poetry, and, historiography, fictionalization, of, historical, events, such, as, anecdote, myth, legend, and, historical, fiction, and, fiction, proper, such, as, literature, in, the, form, of, prose, and, sometimes, poetry, short, stories, novels, narrative, poems, and, songs, and, imaginary, narratives, as, portrayed, in, other, textual, forms, games, or, live, or, recorded, performances, narratives, may, also, be, nested, within, other, narratives, such, as, narratives, told, by, an, unreliable, narrator, a, character, typically, found, in, the, genre, of, noir, fiction, an, important, part, of, many, narratives, is, its, narrative, mode, the, set, of, methods, used, to, communicate, the, narrative, through, a, written, or, spoken, commentary, see, also, aesthetics, approach, below, a, narrative, is, a, telling, of, some, actual, or, fictitious, event, or, connected, sequence, of, events, sometimes, recounted, by, a, narrator, to, an, audience, although, there, may, be, more, than, one, of, each, a, personal, narrative, is, a, prose, narrative, relating, personal, experience, narratives, are, to, be, distinguished, from, descriptions, of, qualities, states, or, situations, and, also, from, dramatic, enactments, of, events, although, a, dramatic, work, may, also, include, narrative, speeches, a, narrative, consists, of, a, set, of, events, the, story, recounted, in, the, process, of, narration, or, discourse, in, which, the, events, are, selected, and, arranged, in, a, particular, order, the, plot, which, can, also, mean, story, synopsis, the, term, emplotment, describes, how, when, making, sense, of, personal, experience, authors, or, other, storytellers, structure, and, order, narratives, the, category, of, narratives, includes, both, the, shortest, accounts, of, events, for, example, the, cat, sat, on, the, mat, or, a, brief, news, item, and, the, most, extended, historical, or, biographical, works, diaries, travelogues, and, so, forth, as, well, as, novels, ballads, epics, short, stories, and, other, fictional, forms, in, the, study, of, fiction, it, is, usual, to, divide, novels, and, shorter, stories, into, first, person, and, third, person, narratives, as, an, adjective, narrative, means, characterized, by, or, relating, to, storytelling, thus, narrative, technique, is, any, of, the, methods, used, for, telling, stories, and, narrative, poetry, is, the, class, of, poems, including, ballads, epics, and, verse, romances, that, tell, stories, as, distinct, from, dramatic, and, lyric, poetry, some, theorists, of, narratology, have, attempted, to, isolate, the, quality, or, set, of, properties, that, distinguishes, narrative, from, non, narrative, writings, this, is, called, narrativity, certain, basic, elements, are, necessary, and, sufficient, to, define, all, works, of, narrative, including, most, well, studied, all, narrative, works, of, fiction, thus, the, following, essential, elements, of, narrative, are, also, often, referred, to, as, the, elements, of, fiction, characters, are, the, individual, persons, inside, a, work, of, narrative, their, choices, and, behaviors, propel, the, plot, forward, they, typically, are, named, humans, whose, actions, and, speech, sometimes, convey, important, motives, they, may, be, entirely, imaginary, or, they, may, have, a, basis, in, real, life, individuals, the, audience, s, first, impressions, are, influential, on, how, they, perceive, a, character, for, example, whether, they, empathize, with, a, character, or, not, feeling, for, them, as, if, they, were, real, the, audience, s, familiarity, with, a, character, results, in, their, expectations, about, how, characters, will, behave, in, later, scenes, characters, who, behave, contrary, to, their, previous, patterns, of, behavior, their, characterization, can, be, confusing, or, jarring, to, the, audience, narratives, usually, have, main, characters, protagonists, whom, the, story, revolves, around, who, encounter, a, central, conflict, or, who, gain, knowledge, or, grow, significantly, across, the, story, some, stories, may, also, have, antagonists, characters, who, oppose, hinder, or, fight, against, the, protagonist, in, many, traditional, narratives, the, protagonist, is, specifically, a, hero, a, sympathetic, person, who, battles, often, literally, for, morally, good, causes, the, hero, may, face, a, villain, an, antagonist, who, fights, against, morally, good, causes, or, even, actively, perpetrates, evil, many, other, ways, of, classifying, characters, exist, too, broadly, speaking, conflict, is, any, tension, that, drives, the, thoughts, and, actions, of, characters, narrowly, speaking, the, conflict, is, the, major, problem, a, protagonist, or, main, character, encounters, across, a, story, often, a, protagonist, additionally, struggles, with, a, sense, of, anxiety, insecurity, indecisiveness, or, other, mental, difficulty, as, result, of, this, conflict, which, can, be, regarded, as, a, secondary, or, internal, conflict, longer, works, of, narrative, typically, involve, many, conflicts, or, smaller, level, conflicts, that, occur, alongside, the, main, one, conflict, can, be, classified, into, a, variety, of, types, with, some, common, ones, being, character, versus, character, character, versus, nature, character, versus, society, character, versus, unavoidable, circumstances, and, character, versus, self, if, the, conflict, is, brought, to, an, end, towards, the, end, of, the, story, this, is, known, as, resolution, the, narrative, mode, is, the, set, of, choices, and, techniques, the, author, or, creator, selects, in, framing, their, story, how, the, narrative, is, told, it, includes, the, scope, of, information, presented, or, withheld, the, type, or, style, of, language, used, the, channel, or, medium, through, which, the, story, is, presented, the, way, and, extent, to, which, narrative, exposition, and, other, types, of, commentary, are, communicated, and, the, overall, point, of, view, or, perspective, an, example, of, narrative, perspective, is, a, first, person, narrative, in, which, some, character, often, the, main, one, refers, openly, to, the, self, using, pronouns, like, i, and, me, in, communicating, the, story, to, the, audience, contrarily, in, a, third, person, narrative, such, pronouns, are, avoided, in, the, telling, of, the, story, perhaps, because, the, teller, is, merely, an, impersonal, written, commentary, of, the, story, rather, than, a, personal, character, within, it, both, of, these, explicit, tellings, of, a, narrative, through, a, spoken, or, written, commentary, are, examples, of, a, technique, called, narration, which, is, required, only, in, written, narratives, but, optional, in, other, types, though, narration, is, a, narrower, term, it, is, occasionally, used, as, a, synonym, for, narrative, mode, in, a, very, broad, sense, the, plot, is, the, sequence, of, events, that, occurs, in, a, narrative, from, the, beginning, to, the, middle, to, the, end, it, typically, occurs, through, a, process, of, cause, and, effect, in, which, characters, actions, or, other, events, produce, reactions, that, allow, the, story, to, progress, put, another, way, plot, is, structured, through, a, series, of, scenes, in, which, related, events, occur, that, lead, to, subsequent, scenes, these, events, form, plot, points, moments, of, change, that, affect, the, characters, understandings, decisions, and, actions, the, movement, of, the, plot, forward, often, corresponds, to, protagonists, encountering, or, realizing, the, conflict, and, then, working, to, resolve, it, creating, emotional, stakes, for, the, characters, as, well, as, the, audience, the, audience, s, anxious, feeling, of, anticipation, due, to, high, emotional, stakes, is, called, suspense, the, setting, is, the, time, place, and, context, in, which, a, story, takes, place, it, includes, the, physical, and, temporal, surroundings, that, the, characters, inhabit, and, can, also, include, the, social, or, cultural, conventions, that, affect, characters, sometimes, the, setting, may, resemble, a, character, in, the, sense, that, it, has, specific, traits, undergoes, actions, that, affect, the, plot, and, develops, over, the, course, of, the, story, themes, are, the, major, underlying, ideas, presented, by, a, story, generally, left, open, to, the, audience, s, own, interpretation, themes, are, more, abstract, than, other, elements, and, are, subjective, open, to, discussion, by, the, audience, who, by, the, story, s, end, can, argue, about, which, big, ideas, or, messages, were, explored, what, conclusions, can, be, drawn, and, which, ones, the, work, s, creator, intended, thus, the, audience, may, come, to, different, conclusions, about, a, work, s, themes, than, what, the, creator, intended, or, regardless, of, what, the, creator, intended, they, can, also, develop, new, ideas, about, its, themes, as, the, work, progresses, in, india, archaeological, evidence, of, the, presence, of, stories, is, found, at, the, indus, valley, civilization, site, lothal, on, one, large, vessel, the, artist, depicts, birds, with, fish, in, their, beaks, resting, in, a, tree, while, a, fox, like, animal, stands, below, this, scene, bears, resemblance, to, the, story, of, the, fox, and, the, crow, in, the, panchatantra, on, a, miniature, jar, the, story, of, the, thirsty, crow, and, deer, is, depicted, of, how, the, deer, could, not, drink, from, the, narrow, mouth, of, the, jar, while, the, crow, succeeded, by, dropping, stones, into, the, jar, the, features, of, the, animals, are, clear, and, graceful, owen, flanagan, of, duke, university, a, leading, consciousness, researcher, writes, evidence, strongly, suggests, that, humans, in, all, cultures, come, to, cast, their, own, identity, in, some, sort, of, narrative, form, we, are, inveterate, storytellers, stories, are, an, important, aspect, of, culture, many, works, of, art, and, most, works, of, literature, tell, stories, indeed, most, of, the, humanities, involve, stories, stories, are, of, ancient, origin, existing, in, ancient, egyptian, ancient, greek, chinese, and, indian, cultures, and, their, myths, stories, are, also, a, ubiquitous, component, of, human, communication, used, as, parables, and, examples, to, illustrate, points, storytelling, was, probably, one, of, the, earliest, forms, of, entertainment, as, noted, by, owen, flanagan, narrative, may, also, refer, to, psychological, processes, in, self, identity, memory, and, meaning, making, semiotics, begins, with, the, individual, building, blocks, of, meaning, called, signs, semantics, is, the, way, in, which, signs, are, combined, into, codes, to, transmit, messages, this, is, part, of, a, general, communication, system, using, both, verbal, and, non, verbal, elements, and, creating, a, discourse, with, different, modalities, and, forms, in, on, realism, in, art, roman, jakobson, attests, that, literature, exists, as, a, separate, entity, he, and, many, other, semioticians, prefer, the, view, that, all, texts, whether, spoken, or, written, are, the, same, except, that, some, authors, encode, their, texts, with, distinctive, literary, qualities, that, distinguish, them, from, other, forms, of, discourse, nevertheless, there, is, a, clear, trend, to, address, literary, narrative, forms, as, separable, from, other, forms, this, is, first, seen, in, russian, formalism, through, victor, shklovsky, s, analysis, of, the, relationship, between, composition, and, style, and, in, the, work, of, vladimir, propp, who, analyzed, the, plots, used, in, traditional, folk, tales, and, identified, 31, distinct, functional, components, this, trend, or, these, trends, continued, in, the, work, of, the, prague, school, and, of, french, scholars, such, as, claude, l, vi, strauss, and, roland, barthes, it, leads, to, a, structural, analysis, of, narrative, and, an, increasingly, influential, body, of, modern, work, that, raises, important, theoretical, questions, in, literary, theoretic, approach, narrative, is, being, narrowly, defined, as, fiction, writing, mode, in, which, the, narrator, is, communicating, directly, to, the, reader, until, the, late, 19th, century, literary, criticism, as, an, academic, exercise, dealt, solely, with, poetry, including, epic, poems, like, the, iliad, and, paradise, lost, and, poetic, drama, like, shakespeare, most, poems, did, not, have, a, narrator, distinct, from, the, author, but, novels, lending, a, number, of, voices, to, several, characters, in, addition, to, narrator, s, created, a, possibility, of, narrator, s, views, differing, significantly, from, the, author, s, views, with, the, rise, of, the, novel, in, the, 18th, century, the, concept, of, the, narrator, as, opposed, to, author, made, the, question, of, narrator, a, prominent, one, for, literary, theory, it, has, been, proposed, that, perspective, and, interpretive, knowledge, are, the, essential, characteristics, while, focalization, and, structure, are, lateral, characteristics, of, the, narrator, the, role, of, literary, theory, in, narrative, has, been, disputed, with, some, interpretations, like, todorov, s, narrative, model, that, views, all, narratives, in, a, cyclical, manner, and, that, each, narrative, is, characterized, by, a, three, part, structure, that, allows, the, narrative, to, progress, the, beginning, stage, being, an, establishment, of, equilibrium, a, state, of, non, conflict, followed, by, a, disruption, to, this, state, caused, by, an, external, event, and, lastly, a, restoration, or, a, return, to, equilibrium, a, conclusion, that, brings, the, narrative, back, to, a, similar, space, before, the, events, of, the, narrative, unfolded, the, school, of, literary, criticism, known, as, russian, formalism, has, applied, methods, that, are, more, often, used, to, analyse, narrative, fiction, to, non, fictional, texts, such, as, political, speeches, other, critiques, of, literary, theory, in, narrative, challenge, the, very, role, of, literariness, in, narrative, as, well, as, the, role, of, narrative, in, literature, meaning, narratives, and, their, associated, aesthetics, emotions, and, values, have, the, ability, to, operate, without, the, presence, of, literature, and, vice, versa, according, to, didier, costa, the, structural, model, used, by, todorov, and, others, is, unfairly, biased, toward, a, western, interpretation, of, narrative, and, that, a, more, comprehensive, and, transformative, model, must, be, created, in, order, to, properly, analyze, narrative, discourse, in, literature, framing, also, plays, a, pivotal, role, in, narrative, structure, an, analysis, of, the, historical, and, cultural, contexts, present, during, the, development, of, a, narrative, is, needed, in, order, to, more, accurately, represent, the, role, of, narratology, in, societies, that, relied, heavily, on, oral, narratives, narrative, is, a, highly, aesthetic, art, thoughtfully, composed, stories, have, a, number, of, aesthetic, elements, such, elements, include, the, idea, of, narrative, structure, with, identifiable, beginnings, middles, and, ends, or, the, process, of, exposition, development, climax, denouement, with, coherent, plot, lines, a, strong, focus, on, temporality, including, retention, of, the, past, attention, to, present, action, and, future, anticipation, a, substantial, focus, on, character, and, characterization, arguably, the, most, important, single, component, of, the, novel, david, lodge, the, art, of, fiction, 67, different, voices, interacting, the, sound, of,

this, idea, a, narrator, or, narrator, like, voice, which, addresses, and, interacts, with, reading, audiences, see, reader, response, theory, communicates, with, a, wayne, booth, esque, rhetorical, thrust, a, dialectic, process, of, interpretation, which, is, at, times, beneath, the, surface, forming, a, plotted, narrative, and, at, other, times, much, more, visible, arguing, for, and, against, various, positions, relies, substantially, on, the, use, of, literary, tropes, see, hayden, white, metahistory, for, expansion, of, this, idea, is, often, intertextual, with, other, literatures, and, commonly, demonstrates, an, effort, toward, bildungsroman, a, description, of, identity, development, with, an, effort, to, evince, becoming, in, character, and, community, within, philosophy, of, mind, the, social, sciences, and, various, clinical, fields, including, medicine, narrative, can, refer, to, aspects, of, human, psychology, a, personal, narrative, process, is, involved, in, a, person, s, sense, of, personal, or, cultural, identity, and, in, the, creation, and, construction, of, memories, it, is, thought, by, some, to, be, the, fundamental, nature, of, the, self, the, breakdown, of, a, coherent, or, positive, narrative, has, been, implicated, in, the, development, of, psychosis, and, mental, disorders, and, its, repair, said, to, play, an, important, role, in, journeys, of, recovery, narrative, therapy, is, a, form, of, psychotherapy, illness, narratives, are, a, way, for, a, person, affected, by, an, illness, to, make, sense, of, his, or, her, experiences, they, typically, follow, one, of, several, set, patterns, restitution, chaos, or, quest, narratives, in, the, restitution, narrative, the, person, sees, the, illness, as, a, temporary, detour, the, primary, goal, is, to, return, permanently, to, normal, life, and, normal, health, these, may, also, be, called, cure, narratives, in, the, chaos, narrative, the, person, sees, the, illness, as, a, permanent, state, that, will, inexorably, get, worse, with, no, redeeming, virtues, this, is, typical, of, diseases, like, alzheimer, s, disease, the, patient, gets, worse, and, worse, and, there, is, no, hope, of, returning, to, normal, life, the, third, major, type, the, quest, narrative, positions, the, illness, experience, as, an, opportunity, to, transform, oneself, into, a, better, person, through, overcoming, adversity, and, re, learning, what, is, most, important, in, life, the, physical, outcome, of, the, illness, is, less, important, than, the, spiritual, and, psychological, transformation, this, is, typical, of, the, triumphant, view, of, cancer, survivorship, in, the, breast, cancer, culture, survivors, may, be, expected, to, articulate, a, wisdom, narrative, in, which, they, explain, to, others, a, new, and, better, view, of, the, meaning, of, life, personality, traits, more, specifically, the, big, five, personality, traits, appear, to, be, associated, with, the, type, of, language, or, patterns, of, word, use, found, in, an, individual, s, self, narrative, in, other, words, language, use, in, self, narratives, accurately, reflects, human, personality, the, linguistic, correlates, of, each, big, five, trait, are, as, follows, human, beings, often, claim, to, understand, events, when, they, manage, to, formulate, a, coherent, story, or, narrative, explaining, how, they, believe, the, event, was, generated, narratives, thus, lie, at, the, foundations, of, our, cognitive, procedures, and, also, provide, an, explanatory, framework, for, the, social, sciences, particularly, when, it, is, difficult, to, assemble, enough, cases, to, permit, statistical, analysis, narrative, is, often, used, in, case, study, research, in, the, social, sciences, here, it, has, been, found, that, the, dense, contextual, and, interpenetrating, nature, of, social, forces, uncovered, by, detailed, narratives, is, often, more, interesting, and, useful, for, both, social, theory, and, social, policy, than, other, forms, of, social, inquiry, research, using, narrative, methods, in, the, social, sciences, has, been, described, as, still, being, in, its, infancy, but, this, perspective, has, several, advantages, such, as, access, to, an, existing, rich, vocabulary, of, analytical, terms, plot, genre, subtext, epic, hero, heroine, story, arc, e, g, beginning, middle, end, and, so, on, another, benefit, is, it, emphasizes, that, even, apparently, non, fictional, documents, speeches, policies, legislation, are, still, fictions, in, the, sense, they, are, authored, and, usually, have, an, intended, audience, in, mind, sociologists, jaber, f, gubrium, and, james, a, holstein, have, contributed, to, the, formation, of, a, constructionist, approach, to, narrative, in, sociology, from, their, book, the, self, we, live, by, narrative, identity, in, a, postmodern, world, 2000, to, more, recent, texts, such, as, analyzing, narrative, reality, 2009, and, varieties, of, narrative, analysis, 2012, they, have, developed, an, analytic, framework, for, researching, stories, and, storytelling, that, is, centered, on, the, interplay, of, institutional, discourses, big, stories, on, the, one, hand, and, everyday, accounts, little, stories, on, the, other, the, goal, is, the, sociological, understanding, of, formal, and, lived, texts, of, experience, featuring, the, production, practices, and, communication, of, accounts, in, order, to, avoid, hardened, stories, or, narratives, that, become, context, free, portable, and, ready, to, be, used, anywhere, and, anytime, for, illustrative, purposes, and, are, being, used, as, conceptual, metaphors, as, defined, by, linguist, george, lakoff, an, approach, called, narrative, inquiry, was, proposed, resting, on, the, epistemological, assumption, that, human, beings, make, sense, of, random, or, complex, multicausal, experience, by, the, imposition, of, story, structures, human, propensity, to, simplify, data, through, a, predilection, for, narratives, over, complex, data, sets, can, lead, to, the, narrative, fallacy, it, is, easier, for, the, human, mind, to, remember, and, make, decisions, on, the, basis, of, stories, with, meaning, than, to, remember, strings, of, data, this, is, one, reason, why, narratives, are, so, powerful, and, why, many, of, the, classics, in, the, humanities, and, social, sciences, are, written, in, the, narrative, format, but, humans, can, read, meaning, into, data, and, compose, stories, even, where, this, is, unwarranted, some, scholars, suggest, that, the, narrative, fallacy, and, other, biases, can, be, avoided, by, applying, standard, methodical, checks, for, validity, statistics, and, reliability, statistics, in, terms, of, how, data, narratives, are, collected, analyzed, and, presented, more, typically, scholars, working, with, narrative, prefer, to, use, other, evaluative, criteria, such, as, believability, or, perhaps, interpretive, validity, since, they, do, not, see, statistical, validity, as, meaningfully, applicable, to, qualitative, data, the, concepts, of, validity, and, reliability, as, understood, from, the, positivist, perspective, are, somehow, inappropriate, and, inadequate, when, applied, to, interpretive, research, several, criteria, for, assessing, the, validity, of, narrative, research, was, proposed, including, the, objective, aspect, the, emotional, aspect, the, social, moral, aspect, and, the, clarity, of, the, story, in, mathematical, sociology, the, theory, of, comparative, narratives, was, devised, in, order, to, describe, and, compare, the, structures, expressed, as, and, in, a, directed, graph, where, multiple, causal, links, incident, into, a, node, are, conjoined, of, action, driven, sequential, events, narratives, so, conceived, comprise, the, following, ingredients, the, structure, directed, graph, is, generated, by, letting, the, nodes, stand, for, the, states, and, the, directed, edges, represent, how, the, states, are, changed, by, specified, actions, the, action, skeleton, can, then, be, abstracted, comprising, a, further, digraph, where, the, actions, are, depicted, as, nodes, and, edges, take, the, form, action, a, co, determined, in, context, of, other, actions, action, b, narratives, can, be, both, abstracted, and, generalised, by, imposing, an, algebra, upon, their, structures, and, thence, defining, homomorphism, between, the, algebras, the, insertion, of, action, driven, causal, links, in, a, narrative, can, be, achieved, using, the, method, of, bayesian, narratives, developed, by, peter, abell, the, theory, of, bayesian, narratives, conceives, a, narrative, as, a, directed, graph, comprising, multiple, causal, links, social, interactions, of, the, general, form, action, a, causes, action, b, in, a, specified, context, in, the, absence, of, sufficient, comparative, cases, to, enable, statistical, treatment, of, the, causal, links, items, of, evidence, in, support, and, against, a, particular, causal, link, are, assembled, and, used, to, compute, the, bayesian, likelihood, ratio, of, the, link, subjective, causal, statements, of, the, form, i, did, b, because, of, a, and, subjective, counterfactuals, if, it, had, not, been, for, a, i, would, not, have, done, b, are, notable, items, of, evidence, linearity, is, one, of, several, narrative, qualities, that, can, be, found, in, a, musical, composition, as, noted, by, american, musicologist, edward, cone, narrative, terms, are, also, present, in, the, analytical, language, about, music, the, different, components, of, a, fugue, subject, answer, exposition, discussion, and, summary, can, be, cited, as, an, example, however, there, are, several, views, on, the, concept, of, narrative, in, music, and, the, role, it, plays, one, theory, is, that, of, theodore, adorno, who, has, suggested, that, music, recites, itself, is, its, own, context, narrates, without, narrative, another, is, that, of, carolyn, abbate, who, has, suggested, that, certain, gestures, experienced, in, music, constitute, a, narrating, voice, still, others, have, argued, that, narrative, is, a, semiotic, enterprise, that, can, enrich, musical, analysis, the, french, musicologist, jean, jacques, nattiez, contends, that, the, narrative, strictly, speaking, is, not, in, the, music, but, in, the, plot, imagined, and, constructed, by, the, listeners, he, argues, that, discussing, music, in, terms, of, narrativity, is, simply, metaphorical, and, that, the, imagined, plot, may, be, influenced, by, the, work, s, title, or, other, programmatic, information, provided, by, the, composer, however, abbate, has, revealed, numerous, examples, of, musical, devices, that, function, as, narrative, voices, by, limiting, music, s, ability, to, narrate, to, rare, moments, that, can, be, identified, by, their, bizarre, and, disruptive, effect, various, theorists, share, this, view, of, narrative, appearing, in, disruptive, rather, than, normative, moments, in, music, the, final, word, is, yet, to, be, said, regarding, narratives, in, music, as, there, is, still, much, to, be, determined, unlike, most, forms, of, narratives, that, are, inherently, language, based, whether, that, be, narratives, presented, in, literature, or, orally, film, narratives, face, additional, challenges, in, creating, a, cohesive, narrative, whereas, the, general, assumption, in, literary, theory, is, that, a, narrator, must, be, present, in, order, to, develop, a, narrative, as, schmid, proposes, the, act, of, an, author, writing, his, or, her, words, in, text, is, what, communicates, to, the, audience, in, this, case, readers, the, narrative, of, the, text, and, the, author, represents, an, act, of, narrative, communication, between, the, textual, narrator, and, the, narratee, this, is, in, line, with, fludernik, s, perspective, on, what, s, called, cognitive, narratology, which, states, that, a, literary, text, has, the, ability, to, manifest, itself, into, an, imagined, representational, illusion, that, the, reader, will, create, for, themselves, and, can, vary, greatly, from, reader, to, reader, in, other, words, the, scenarios, of, a, literary, text, referring, to, settings, frames, schemes, etc, are, going, to, be, represented, differently, for, each, individual, reader, based, on, a, multiplicity, of, factors, including, the, reader, s, own, personal, life, experiences, that, allow, them, to, comprehend, the, literary, text, in, a, distinct, manner, from, anyone, else, film, narrative, does, not, have, the, luxury, of, having, a, textual, narrator, that, guides, its, audience, toward, a, formative, narrative, nor, does, it, have, the, ability, to, allow, its, audience, to, visually, manifest, the, contents, of, its, narrative, in, a, unique, fashion, like, literature, does, instead, film, narratives, utilize, visual, and, auditory, devices, in, substitution, for, a, narrative, subject, these, devices, include, cinematography, editing, sound, design, both, diegetic, and, non, diegetic, sound, as, well, as, the, arrangement, and, decisions, on, how, and, where, the, subjects, are, located, onscreen, known, as, mise, en, sc, ne, these, cinematic, devices, among, others, contribute, to, the, unique, blend, of, visual, and, auditory, storytelling, that, culminates, to, what, jose, landa, refers, to, as, a, visual, narrative, instance, and, unlike, narratives, found, in, other, performance, arts, such, as, plays, and, musicals, film, narratives, are, not, bound, to, a, specific, place, and, time, and, are, not, limited, by, scene, transitions, in, plays, which, are, restricted, by, set, design, and, allotted, time, the, nature, or, existence, of, a, formative, narrative, in, many, of, the, world, s, myths, folktales, and, legends, has, been, a, topic, of, debate, for, many, modern, scholars, but, the, most, common, consensus, among, academics, is, that, throughout, most, cultures, traditional, mythologies, and, folklore, tales, are, constructed, and, retold, with, a, specific, narrative, purpose, that, serves, to, offer, a, society, an, understandable, explanation, of, natural, phenomena, oftentimes, absent, of, a, verifiable, author, these, explanatory, tales, manifest, themselves, in, various, forms, and, serve, different, societal, functions, including, life, lessons, for, individuals, to, learn, from, for, example, the, ancient, greek, tale, of, icarus, refusing, to, listen, to, his, elders, and, flying, too, close, to, the, sun, explaining, forces, of, nature, or, other, natural, phenomena, for, example, the, flood, myth, that, spans, cultures, all, over, the, world, and, providing, an, understanding, of, human, nature, as, exemplified, by, the, myth, of, cupid, and, psyche, considering, how, mythologies, have, historically, been, transmitted, and, passed, down, through, oral, retellings, there, is, no, qualitative, or, reliable, method, to, precisely, trace, exactly, where, and, when, a, tale, originated, and, since, myths, are, rooted, in, a, remote, past, and, are, viewed, as, a, factual, account, of, happenings, within, the, culture, it, originated, from, the, worldview, present, in, many, oral, mythologies, is, from, a, cosmological, perspective, one, that, is, told, from, a, voice, that, has, no, physical, embodiment, and, is, passed, down, and, modified, from, generation, to, generation, this, cosmological, worldview, in, myth, is, what, provides, all, mythological, narratives, credence, and, since, they, are, easily, communicated, and, modified, through, oral, tradition, among, various, cultures, they, help, solidify, the, cultural, identity, of, a, civilization, and, contribute, to, the, notion, of, a, collective, human, consciousness, that, continues, to, help, shape, one, s, own, understanding, of, the, world, myth, is, often, used, in, an, overarching, sense, to, describe, a, multitude, of, folklore, genres, but, there, is, a, significance, in, distinguishing, the, various, forms, of, folklore, in, order, to, properly, determine, what, narratives, constitute, as, mythological, as, anthropologist, sir, james, frazer, suggests, frazer, contends, that, there, are, three, primary, categories, of, mythology, now, more, broadly, considered, categories, of, folklore, myths, legends, and, folktales, and, that, by, definition, each, genre, pulls, its, narrative, from, a, different, ontological, source, and, therefore, has, different, implications, within, a, civilization, frazer, states, if, these, definitions, be, accepted, we, may, say, that, myth, has, its, source, in, reason, legend, in, memory, and, folk, tale, in, imagination, and, that, the, three, riper, products, of, the, human, mind, which, correspond, to, these, its, crude, creations, are, science, history, and, romance, janet, bacon, expanded, upon, frazer, s, categorization, in, her, 1921, publication, the, voyage, of, the, argonauts, in, the, absence, of, a, known, author, or, original, narrator, myth, narratives, are, oftentimes, referred, to, as, prose, narratives, prose, narratives, tend, to, be, relatively, linear, regarding, the, time, period, they, occur, in, and, are, traditionally, marked, by, its, natural, flow, of, speech, as, opposed, to, the, rhythmic, structure, found, in, various, forms, of, literature, such, as, poetry, and, haikus, the, structure, of, prose, narratives, allows, it, to, be, easily, understood, by, many, as, the, narrative, generally, starts, at, the, beginning, of, the, story, and, ends, when, the, protagonist, has, resolved, the, conflict, these, kinds, of, narratives, are, generally, accepted, as, true, within, society, and, are, told, from, a, place, of, great, reverence, and, sacredness, myths, are, believed, to, occur, in, a, remote, past, one, that, is, before, the, creation, or, establishment, of, the, civilization, they, derive, from, and, are, intended, to, provide, an, account, for, things, such, as, humanity, s, origins, natural, phenomenon, and, human, nature, thematically, myths, seek, to, provide, information, about, oneself, and, many, are, viewed, as, among, some, of, the, oldest, forms, of, prose, narratives, which, grants, traditional, myths, their, life, defining, characteristics, that, continue, to, be, communicated, today, another, theory, regarding, the, purpose, and, function, of, mythological, narratives, derives, from, 20th, century, philologist, georges, dum, zil, and, his, formative, theory, of, the, trifunctionalism, found, in, indo, european, mythologies, dum, zil, refers, only, to, the, myths, found, in, indo, european, societies, but, the, primary, assertion, made, by, his, theory, is, that, indo, european, life, was, structured, around, the, notion, of, three, distinct, and, necessary, societal, functions, and, as, a, result, the, various, gods, and, goddesses, in, indo, european, mythology, assumed, these, functions, as, well, the, three, functions, were, organized, by, cultural, significance, with, the, first, function, being, the, most, grand, and, sacred, for, dum, zil, these, functions, were, so, vital, they, manifested, themselves, in, every, aspect, of, life, and, were, at, the, center, of, everyday, life, these, functions, as, dum, zil, puts, it, were, an, array, of, esoteric, knowledge, and, wisdom, that, was, reflected, by, the, mythology, the, first, function, was, sovereignty, and, was, divided, into, two, additional, categories, magical, and, juridical, as, each, function, in, dum, zil, s, theory, corresponded, to, a, designated, social, class, in, the, human, realm, the, first, function, was, the, highest, and, was, reserved, for, the, status, of, kings, and, other, royalty, in, an, interview, with, alain, benoist, dum, zil, described, magical, sovereignty, as, such, consists, of, the, mysterious, administration, the, magic, of, the, universe, the, general, ordering, of, the, cosmos, this, is, a, disquieting, aspect, terrifying, from, certain, perspectives, the, other, aspect, is, more, reassuring, more, oriented, to, the, human, world, it, is, the, juridical, part, of, the, sovereign, function, this, implies, that, gods, of, the, first, function, are, responsible, for, the, overall, structure, and, order, of, the, universe, and, those, gods, who, possess, juridical, sovereignty, are, more, closely, connected, to, the, realm, of, humans, and, are, responsible, for, the, concept, of, justice, and, order, dum, zil, uses, the, pantheon, of, norse, gods, as, examples, of, these, functions, in, his, 1981, essay, he, finds, that, the, norse, gods, odin, and, tyr, reflect, the, different, brands, of, sovereignty, odin, is, the, author, of, the, cosmos, and, possessor, of, infinite, esoteric, knowledge, going, so, far, as, to, sacrifice, his, eye, for, the, accumulation, of, more, knowledge, while, tyr, seen, as, the, just, god, is, more, concerned, with, upholding, justice, as, illustrated, by, the, epic, myth, of, tyr, losing, his, hand, in, exchange, for, the, monster, fenrir, to, cease, his, terrorization, of, the, gods, dum, zil, s, theory, suggests, that, through, these, myths, concepts, of, universal, wisdom, and, justice, were, able, to, be, communicated, to, the, nordic, people, in, the, form, of, a, mythological, narrative, the, second, function, as, described, by, dum, zil, is, that, of, the, proverbial, hero, or, champion, these, myths, functioned, to, convey, the, themes, of, heroism, strength, and, bravery, and, were, most, often, represented, in, both, the, human, world, and, the, mythological, world, by, valiant, warriors, while, the, gods, of, the, second, function, were, still, revered, in, society, they, did, not, possess, the, same, infinite, knowledge, found, in, the, first, category, a, norse, god, that, would, fall, under, the, second, function, would, be, thor, god, of, thunder, thor, possessed, great, strength, and, was, often, first, into, battle, as, ordered, by, his, father, odin, this, second, function, reflects, indo, european, cultures, high, regard, for, the, warrior, class, and, explains, the, belief, in, an, afterlife, that, rewards, a, valiant, death, on, the, battlefield, for, the, norse, mythology, this, is, represented, by, valhalla, lastly, dum, zil, s, third, function, is, composed, of, gods, that, reflect, the, nature, and, values, of, the, most, common, people, in, indo, european, life, these, gods, often, presided, over, the, realms, of, healing, prosperity, fertility, wealth, luxury, and, youth, any, kind, of, function, that, was, easily, related, to, by, the, common, peasant, farmer, in, a, society, just, as, a, farmer, would, live, and, sustain, themselves, off, their, land, the, gods, of, the, third, function, were, responsible, for, the, prosperity, of, their, crops, and, were, also, in, charge, of, other, forms, of, everyday, life, that, would, never, be, observed, by, the, status, of, kings, and, warriors, such, as, mischievousness, and, promiscuity, an, example, found, in, norse, mythology, could, be, seen, through, the, god, freyr, a, god, who, was, closely, connected, to, acts, of, debauchery, and, overindulging, dum, zil, viewed, his, theory, of, trifunctionalism, as, distinct, from, other, mythological, theories, because, of, the, way, the, narratives, of, indo, european, mythology, permeated, into, every, aspect, of, life, within, these, societies, to, the, point, that, the, societal, view, of, death, shifted, away, from, a, primal, perception, that, tells, one, to, fear, death, and, instead, death, became, seen, as, the, penultimate, act, of, heroism, by, solidifying, a, person, s, position, in, the, hall, of, the, gods, when, they, pass, from, this, realm, to, the, next, additionally, dum, zil, proposed, that, his, theory, stood, at, the, foundation, of, the, modern, understanding, of, the, christian, trinity, citing, that, the, three, key, deities, of, odin, thor, and, freyr, were, often, depicted, together, in, a, trio, seen, by, many, as, an, overarching, representation, of, what, would, be, known, today, as, divinity, a, narrative, can, take, on, the, shape, of, a, story, which, gives, listeners, an, entertaining, and, collaborative, avenue, for, acquiring, knowledge, many, cultures, use, storytelling, as, a, way, to, record, histories, myths, and, values, these, stories, can, be, seen, as, living, entities, of, narrative, among, cultural, communities, as, they, carry, the, shared, experience, and, history, of, the, culture, within, them, stories, are, often, used, within, indigenous, cultures, in, order, to, share, knowledge, to, the, younger, generation, due, to, indigenous, narratives, leaving, room, for, open, ended, interpretation, native, stories, often, engage, children, in, the, storytelling, process, so, that, they, can, make, their, own, meaning, and, explanations, within, the, story, this, promotes, holistic, thinking, among, native, children, which, works, toward, merging, an, individual, and, world, identity, such, an, identity, upholds, native, epistemology, and, gives, children, a, sense, of, belonging, as, their, cultural, identity, develops, through, the, sharing, and, passing, on, of, stories, for, example, a, number, of, indigenous, stories, are, used, to, illustrate, a, value, or, lesson, in, the, western, apache, tribe, stories, can, be, used, to, warn, of, the, misfortune, that, befalls, people, when, they, do, not, follow, acceptable, behavior, one, story, speaks, to, the, offense, of, a, mother, s, meddling, in, her, married, son, s, life, in, the, story, the, western, apache, tribe, is, under, attack, from, a, neighboring, tribe, the, pimas, the, apache, mother, hears, a, scream, thinking, it, is, her, son, s, wife, screaming, she, tries, to, intervene, by, yelling, at, him, this, alerts, the, pima, tribe, to, her, location, and, she, is, promptly, killed, due, to, intervening, in, her, son, s, life, indigenous, american, cultures, use, storytelling, to, teach, children, the, values, and, lessons, of, life, although, storytelling, provides, entertainment, its, primary, purpose, is, to, educate, alaskan, indigenous, natives, state, that, narratives, teach, children, where, they, fit, in, what, their, society, expects, of, them, how, to, create, a, peaceful, living, environment, and, to, be, responsible, worthy, members, of, their, communities, in, the, mexican, culture, many, adult, figures, tell, their, children, stories, in, order, to, teach, children, values, such, as, individuality, obedience, honesty, trust, and, compassion, for, example, one, of, the, versions, of, la, llorona, is, used, to, teach, children, to, make, safe, decisions, at, night, and, to, maintain, the, morals, of, the, community, narratives, are, considered, by, the, canadian, m, tis, community, to, help, children, understand, that, the, world, around, them, is, interconnected, to, their, lives, and, communities, for, example, the, m, tis, community, share, the, humorous, horse, story, to, children, which, portrays, that, horses, stumble, throughout, life, just, like, humans, do, navajo, stories, also, use, dead, animals, as, metaphors, by, showing, that, all, things, have, purpose, lastly, elders, from, alaskan, native, communities, claim, that, the, use, of, animals, as, metaphors, allow, children, to, form, their, own, perspectives, while, at, the, same, time, self, reflecting, on, their, own, lives, american, indian, elders, also, state, that, storytelling, invites, the, listeners, especially, children, to, draw, their, own, conclusions, and, perspectives, while, self, reflecting, upon, their, lives, furthermore, they, insist, that, narratives, help, children, grasp, and, obtain, a, wide, range, of, perspectives, that, help, them, interpret, their, lives, in, the, context, of, the, story, american, indian, community, members, emphasize, to, children, that, the, method, of, obtaining, knowledge, can, be, found, in, stories, passed, down, through, each, generation, moreover, community, members, also, let, the, children, interpret, and, build, a, different, perspective, of, each, story, an, emerging, field, of, information, warfare, is, the, battle, of, the, narratives, the, battle, of, the, narratives, is, a, full, blown, battle, in, the, cognitive, dimension, of, the, information, environment, just, as, traditional, warfare, is, fought, in, the, physical, domains, air, land, sea, space, and, cyberspace, one, of, the, foundational, struggles, in, warfare, in, the, physical, domains, is, to, shape, the, environment, such, that, the, contest, of, arms, will, be, fought, on, terms, that, are, to, one, s, advantage, likewise, a, key, component, of, the, battle, of, the, narratives, is, to, succeed, in, establishing, the, reasons, for, and, potential, outcomes, of, the, conflict, on, terms, favorable, to, one, s, efforts, in, historiography, according, to, lawrence, stone, narrative, has, traditionally, been, the, main, rhetorical, device, used, by, historians, in, 1979, at, a, time, when, the, new, social, history, was, demanding, a, social, science, model, of, analysis, stone, detected, a, move, back, toward, the, narrative, stone, defined, narrative, as, organized, chronologically, focused, on, a, single, coherent, story, descriptive, rather, than, analytical, concerned, with, people, not, abstract, circumstances, and, dealing, with, the, particular, and, specific, rather, than, the, collective, and, statistical, he, reported, that, more, and, more, of, the, new, historians, are, now, trying, to, discover, what, was, going, on, inside, people, s, heads, in, the, past, and, what, it, was, like, to, live, in, the, past, questions, which, inevitably, lead, back, to, the, use, of, narrative, some, philosophers, identify, narratives, with, a, type, of, explanation, mark, bevir, argues, for, example, that, narratives, explain, actions, by, appealing, to, the, beliefs, and, desires, of, actors, and, by, locating, webs, of, beliefs, in, the, context, of, historical, traditions, narrative, is, an, alternative, form, of, explanation, to, that, associated, with, natural, science, historians, committed, to, a, social, science, approach, however, have, criticized, the, narrowness, of, narrative, and, its, preference, for, anecdote, over, analysis, and, clever, examples, rather, than, statistical, regularities, storytelling, rights, may, be, broadly, defined, as, the, ethics, of, sharing, narratives, including, but, not, limited, to, firsthand, secondhand, and, imagined, stories, in, storytelling, rights, the, uses, of, oral, and, written, texts, by, urban, adolescents, author, amy, shuman, offers, the, following, definition, of, storytelling, rights, the, important, and, precarious, relationship, between, narrative, and, event, and, specifically, between, the, participants, in, an, event, and, the, reporters, who, claim, the, right, to, talk, about, what, happened, the, ethics, of, retelling, other, people, s, stories, may, be, explored, through, a, number, of, questions, whose, story, is, being, told, and, how, what, is, the, story, s, purpose, or, aim, what, does, the, story, promise, for, instance, empathy, redemption, authenticity, clarification, and, at, whose, benefit, storytelling, rights, also, implicates, questions, of, consent, empathy, and, accurate, representation, while, storytelling, and, retelling, can, function, as, a, powerful, tool, for, agency, and, advocacy, it, can, also, lead, to, misunderstanding, and, exploitation, storytelling, rights, is, notably, important, in, the, genre, of, personal, experience, narrative, academic, disciplines, such, as, performance, folklore, literature, anthropology, cultural, studies, and, other, social, sciences, may, involve, the, study, of, storytelling, rights, often, hinging, on, ethics
