the, oboe, o, b, o, oh, boh, is, a, type, of, double, reed, woodwind, instrument, oboes, are, usually, made, of, wood, but, may, also, be, made, of, synthetic, materials, such, as, plastic, resin, or, hybrid, composites, the, most, common, type, of, oboe, the, soprano, oboe, pitched, in, c, measures, roughly, 65, cm, 25, 1, 2, in, long, and, has, metal, keys, a, conical, bore, and, a, flared, bell, sound, is, produced, by, blowing, into, the, reed, at, a, sufficient, air, pressure, causing, it, to, vibrate, with, the, air, column, the, distinctive, tone, is, versatile, and, has, been, described, as, bright, when, the, word, oboe, is, used, alone, it, is, generally, taken, to, mean, the, soprano, member, rather, than, other, instruments, of, the, family, such, as, the, bass, oboe, the, cor, anglais, english, horn, or, oboe, d, amore, today, the, oboe, is, commonly, used, as, orchestral, or, solo, instrument, in, symphony, orchestras, concert, bands, and, chamber, ensembles, the, oboe, is, especially, used, in, classical, music, film, music, some, genres, of, folk, music, and, is, occasionally, heard, in, jazz, rock, pop, and, popular, music, the, oboe, is, widely, recognized, as, the, instrument, that, tunes, the, orchestra, with, its, distinctive, a, a, musician, who, plays, the, oboe, is, called, an, oboist, in, comparison, to, other, modern, woodwind, instruments, the, soprano, oboe, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, having, a, bright, and, penetrating, voice, the, sprightly, companion, an, instruction, book, published, by, henry, playford, in, 1695, describes, the, oboe, as, majestical, and, stately, and, not, much, inferior, to, the, trumpet, in, the, play, angels, in, america, the, sound, is, described, as, like, that, of, a, duck, if, the, duck, were, a, songbird, the, rich, timbre, is, derived, from, its, conical, bore, as, opposed, to, the, generally, cylindrical, bore, of, flutes, and, clarinets, as, a, result, oboes, are, easier, to, hear, over, other, instruments, in, large, ensembles, due, to, its, penetrating, sound, the, highest, note, is, a, semitone, lower, than, the, nominally, highest, note, of, the, b, clarinet, since, the, clarinet, has, a, wider, range, the, lowest, note, of, the, b, clarinet, is, significantly, deeper, a, minor, sixth, than, the, lowest, note, of, the, oboe, music, for, the, standard, oboe, is, written, in, concert, pitch, i, e, it, is, not, a, transposing, instrument, and, the, instrument, has, a, soprano, range, usually, from, b, 3, to, g, 6, orchestras, tune, to, a, concert, a, played, by, the, first, oboe, according, to, the, league, of, american, orchestras, this, is, done, because, the, pitch, is, secure, and, its, penetrating, sound, makes, it, ideal, for, tuning, the, pitch, of, the, oboe, is, affected, by, the, way, in, which, the, reed, is, made, the, reed, has, a, significant, effect, on, the, sound, variations, in, cane, and, other, construction, materials, the, age, of, the, reed, and, differences, in, scrape, and, length, all, affect, the, pitch, german, and, french, reeds, for, instance, differ, in, many, ways, causing, the, sound, to, vary, accordingly, weather, conditions, such, as, temperature, and, humidity, also, affect, the, pitch, skilled, oboists, adjust, their, embouchure, to, compensate, for, these, factors, subtle, manipulation, of, embouchure, and, air, pressure, allows, the, oboist, to, express, timbre, and, dynamics, the, oboe, uses, a, double, reed, similar, to, that, used, for, the, bassoon, most, professional, oboists, make, their, reeds, to, suit, their, individual, needs, by, making, their, reeds, oboists, can, precisely, control, factors, such, as, tone, color, intonation, and, responsiveness, they, can, also, account, for, individual, embouchure, oral, cavity, oboe, angle, and, air, support, novice, oboists, rarely, make, their, own, reeds, as, the, process, is, difficult, and, time, consuming, and, frequently, purchase, reeds, from, a, music, store, instead, commercially, available, cane, reeds, are, available, in, several, degrees, of, hardness, a, medium, reed, is, very, popular, and, most, beginners, use, medium, soft, reeds, these, reeds, like, clarinet, saxophone, and, bassoon, reeds, are, made, from, arundo, donax, as, oboists, gain, more, experience, they, may, start, making, their, own, reeds, after, the, model, of, their, teacher, or, buying, handmade, reeds, usually, from, a, professional, oboist, and, using, special, tools, including, gougers, pre, gougers, guillotines, shaper, tips, knives, and, other, tools, to, make, and, adjust, reeds, to, their, liking, the, reed, is, considered, the, part, of, oboe, that, makes, the, instrument, so, difficult, because, the, individual, nature, of, each, reed, means, that, it, is, hard, to, achieve, a, consistent, sound, slight, variations, in, temperature, humidity, altitude, weather, and, climate, can, also, have, an, effect, on, the, sound, of, the, reed, as, well, as, minute, changes, in, the, physique, of, the, reed, oboists, often, prepare, several, reeds, to, achieve, a, consistent, sound, as, well, as, to, prepare, for, environmental, factors, such, as, chipping, of, a, reed, or, other, hazards, oboists, may, have, different, preferred, methods, for, soaking, their, reeds, to, produce, optimal, sounds, the, most, preferred, method, tends, to, be, to, soak, the, oboe, reed, in, water, before, playing, plastic, oboe, reeds, are, rarely, used, and, are, less, readily, available, than, plastic, reeds, for, other, instruments, such, as, the, clarinet, however, they, do, exist, and, are, produced, by, brands, such, as, legere, in, english, prior, to, 1770, the, standard, instrument, was, called, a, hautbois, hoboy, or, french, hoboy, h, o, b, hoh, boy, this, was, borrowed, from, the, french, name, hautbois, which, is, a, compound, word, made, up, of, haut, high, loud, and, bois, wood, woodwind, the, french, word, means, high, pitched, woodwind, in, english, the, spelling, of, oboe, was, adopted, into, english, c, 1770, from, the, italian, obo, a, transliteration, of, the, 17th, century, pronunciation, of, the, french, name, the, regular, oboe, first, appeared, in, the, mid, 17th, century, when, it, was, called, a, hautbois, this, name, was, also, used, for, its, predecessor, the, shawm, from, which, the, basic, form, of, the, hautbois, was, derived, major, differences, between, the, two, instruments, include, the, division, of, the, hautbois, into, three, sections, or, joints, which, allowed, for, more, precise, manufacture, and, the, elimination, of, the, pirouette, the, wooden, ledge, below, the, reed, which, allowed, players, to, rest, their, lips, the, exact, date, and, location, of, origin, of, the, hautbois, are, obscure, as, are, the, inventors, circumstantial, evidence, such, as, the, statement, by, the, flautist, composer, michel, de, la, barre, in, his, memoire, points, to, members, of, the, philidor, filidor, and, hotteterre, families, the, instrument, may, in, fact, have, had, multiple, inventors, the, hautbois, quickly, spread, throughout, europe, including, great, britain, where, it, was, called, hautboy, hoboy, hautboit, howboye, and, similar, variants, of, the, french, name, it, was, the, main, melody, instrument, in, early, military, bands, until, it, was, succeeded, by, the, clarinet, the, standard, baroque, oboe, is, generally, made, of, boxwood, and, has, three, keys, a, great, key, and, two, side, keys, the, side, key, is, often, doubled, to, facilitate, use, of, either, the, right, or, left, hand, on, the, bottom, holes, in, order, to, produce, higher, pitches, the, player, has, to, overblow, or, increase, the, air, stream, to, reach, the, next, harmonic, notable, oboe, makers, of, the, period, are, the, germans, jacob, denner, and, j, h, eichentopf, and, the, english, thomas, stanesby, died, 1734, and, his, son, thomas, jr, died, 1754, the, range, for, the, baroque, oboe, comfortably, extends, from, c, 4, to, d, 6, in, the, mid, 20th, century, with, the, resurgence, of, interest, in, early, music, a, few, makers, began, producing, copies, to, specifications, taken, from, surviving, historical, instruments, the, classical, period, brought, a, regular, oboe, whose, bore, was, gradually, narrowed, and, the, instrument, became, outfitted, with, several, keys, among, them, those, for, the, notes, d, f, and, g, a, key, similar, to, the, modern, octave, key, was, also, added, called, the, slur, key, though, it, was, at, first, used, more, like, the, flick, keys, on, the, modern, german, bassoon, only, later, did, french, instrument, makers, redesign, the, octave, key, to, be, used, in, the, manner, of, the, modern, key, i, e, held, open, for, the, upper, register, closed, for, the, lower, the, narrower, bore, allows, the, higher, notes, to, be, more, easily, played, and, composers, began, to, use, the, oboe, s, upper, register, more, often, in, their, works, because, of, this, the, oboe, s, tessitura, in, the, classical, era, was, somewhat, broader, than, that, found, in, baroque, works, the, range, for, the, classical, oboe, extends, from, c, 4, to, f, 6, using, the, scientific, pitch, notation, system, though, some, german, and, austrian, oboes, are, capable, of, playing, one, half, step, lower, several, classical, era, composers, wrote, concertos, for, oboe, mozart, composed, both, the, solo, concerto, in, c, major, k, 314, 285d, and, the, lost, original, of, sinfonia, concertante, in, e, major, k, 297b, as, well, as, a, fragment, of, f, major, concerto, k, 417f, haydn, wrote, both, the, sinfonia, concertante, in, b, hob, i, 105, and, the, spurious, concerto, in, c, major, hob, viig, c1, beethoven, wrote, the, f, major, concerto, hess, 12, of, which, only, sketches, survive, though, the, second, movement, was, reconstructed, in, the, late, 20th, century, numerous, other, composers, including, johann, christian, bach, johann, christian, fischer, jan, anton, n, ko, eluh, and, ludwig, august, lebrun, also, composed, pieces, for, the, oboe, many, solos, exist, for, the, regular, oboe, in, chamber, symphonic, and, operatic, compositions, from, the, classical, era, the, wiener, oboe, viennese, oboe, is, a, type, of, modern, oboe, that, retains, the, essential, bore, and, tonal, characteristics, of, the, historical, oboe, the, akademiemodel, wiener, oboe, first, developed, in, the, late, 19th, century, by, josef, hajek, from, earlier, instruments, by, c, t, golde, of, dresden, 1803, 73, is, now, made, by, several, makers, such, as, andr, constantinides, karl, rado, guntram, wolf, christian, rauch, and, yamaha, it, has, a, wider, internal, bore, a, shorter, and, broader, reed, and, the, fingering, system, is, very, different, from, the, conservatoire, oboe, in, the, oboe, geoffrey, burgess, and, bruce, haynes, write, the, differences, are, most, clearly, marked, in, the, middle, register, which, is, reedier, and, more, pungent, and, the, upper, register, which, is, richer, in, harmonics, on, the, viennese, oboe, guntram, wolf, describes, them, from, the, concept, of, the, bore, the, viennese, oboe, is, the, last, representative, of, the, historical, oboes, adapted, for, the, louder, larger, orchestra, and, fitted, with, an, extensive, mechanism, its, great, advantage, is, the, ease, of, speaking, even, in, the, lowest, register, it, can, be, played, very, expressively, and, blends, well, with, other, instruments, the, viennese, oboe, is, along, with, the, vienna, horn, perhaps, the, most, distinctive, member, of, the, wiener, philharmoniker, instrumentarium, this, oboe, was, developed, further, in, the, 19th, century, by, the, tri, bert, family, of, paris, using, the, boehm, flute, as, a, source, of, ideas, for, key, work, guillaume, tri, bert, and, his, sons, charles, and, frederic, devised, a, series, of, increasingly, complex, yet, functional, key, systems, a, variant, form, using, large, tone, holes, the, boehm, system, oboe, was, never, in, common, use, though, it, was, used, in, some, military, bands, in, europe, into, the, 20th, century, f, lor, e, of, paris, made, further, developments, to, the, modern, instrument, minor, improvements, to, the, bore, and, key, work, have, continued, through, the, 20th, century, but, there, has, been, no, fundamental, change, to, the, general, characteristics, of, the, instrument, for, several, decades, the, modern, standard, oboe, is, most, commonly, made, from, grenadilla, also, known, as, african, blackwood, although, some, manufacturers, also, make, oboes, out, of, other, species, of, the, genus, dalbergia, which, includes, cocobolo, rosewood, and, violetwood, also, known, as, kingwood, ebony, genus, diospyros, has, also, been, used, student, model, oboes, are, often, made, from, plastic, resin, to, make, the, instrument, cheaper, and, more, durable, the, oboe, has, an, extremely, narrow, conical, bore, it, is, played, with, a, double, reed, consisting, of, two, thin, blades, of, cane, tied, together, on, a, small, diameter, metal, tube, staple, which, is, inserted, into, the, reed, socket, at, the, top, of, the, instrument, the, commonly, accepted, range, for, the, oboe, extends, from, b, 3, to, about, g, 6, over, two, and, a, half, octaves, though, its, common, tessitura, lies, from, c, 4, to, e, 6, some, student, oboes, do, not, have, a, b, key, and, only, extend, down, to, b, 3, a, modern, oboe, with, the, full, conservatoire, conservatory, in, the, us, or, gillet, key, system, has, 45, pieces, of, keywork, with, the, possible, additions, of, a, third, octave, key, and, alternate, left, little, finger, f, or, c, key, the, keys, are, usually, made, of, nickel, silver, and, are, silver, or, occasionally, gold, plated, besides, the, full, conservatoire, system, oboes, are, also, made, using, the, british, thumbplate, system, most, have, semi, automatic, octave, keys, in, which, the, second, octave, action, closes, the, first, and, some, have, a, fully, automatic, octave, key, system, as, used, on, saxophones, some, full, conservatory, oboes, have, finger, holes, covered, with, rings, rather, than, plates, open, holed, and, most, of, the, professional, models, have, at, least, the, right, hand, third, key, open, holed, professional, oboes, used, in, the, uk, and, iceland, frequently, feature, conservatoire, system, combined, with, a, thumb, plate, releasing, the, thumb, plate, has, the, same, effect, as, pressing, down, the, right, hand, index, finger, key, this, produces, alternate, options, which, eliminate, the, necessity, for, most, of, the, common, cross, intervals, intervals, where, two, or, more, keys, need, to, be, released, and, pressed, down, simultaneously, as, cross, intervals, are, much, more, difficult, to, execute, in, such, a, way, that, the, sound, remains, clear, and, continuous, throughout, the, frequency, change, a, quality, also, called, legato, and, often, called, for, in, the, oboe, repertoire, the, standard, oboe, has, several, siblings, of, various, sizes, and, playing, ranges, the, most, widely, known, and, used, today, is, the, cor, anglais, english, horn, the, tenor, or, alto, member, of, the, family, a, transposing, instrument, it, is, pitched, in, f, a, perfect, fifth, lower, than, the, oboe, the, oboe, d, amore, the, alto, or, mezzo, soprano, member, of, the, family, is, pitched, in, a, a, minor, third, lower, than, the, oboe, j, s, bach, made, extensive, use, of, both, the, oboe, d, amore, as, well, as, the, taille, and, oboe, da, caccia, baroque, antecedents, of, the, cor, anglais, less, common, is, the, bass, oboe, also, called, baritone, oboe, which, sounds, one, octave, lower, than, the, oboe, delius, strauss, and, holst, scored, for, the, instrument, similar, to, the, bass, oboe, is, the, more, powerful, heckelphone, which, has, a, wider, bore, and, larger, tone, than, the, baritone, oboe, only, 165, heckelphones, have, ever, been, made, competent, heckelphone, players, are, difficult, to, find, due, to, the, extreme, rarity, of, this, particular, instrument, the, least, common, of, all, are, the, musette, also, called, oboe, musette, or, piccolo, oboe, the, sopranino, member, of, the, family, it, is, usually, pitched, in, e, or, f, above, the, oboe, and, the, contrabass, oboe, typically, pitched, in, c, two, octaves, deeper, than, the, standard, oboe, folk, versions, of, the, oboe, sometimes, equipped, with, extensive, keywork, are, found, throughout, europe, these, include, the, musette, france, and, the, piston, oboe, and, bombarde, brittany, the, piffero, and, ciaramella, italy, and, the, xirimia, also, spelled, chirimia, spain, many, of, these, are, played, in, tandem, with, local, forms, of, bagpipe, particularly, with, the, italian, m, sa, and, zampogna, or, breton, biniou, the, oboe, remains, uncommon, in, jazz, music, but, there, have, been, notable, uses, of, the, instrument, some, early, bands, in, the, 1920s, and, 30s, most, notably, that, of, paul, whiteman, included, it, for, coloristic, purposes, most, often, in, this, era, it, was, used, for, dance, band, music, but, occasionally, oboists, may, be, heard, used, in, a, similar, manner, to, a, saxophone, for, solos, most, of, the, time, these, oboists, were, already, playing, with, the, band, or, orchestra, on, a, different, woodwind, instrument, the, multi, instrumentalist, garvin, bushell, 1902, 1991, played, the, oboe, in, jazz, bands, as, early, as, 1924, and, used, the, instrument, throughout, his, career, eventually, recording, with, john, coltrane, in, 1961, gil, evans, featured, oboe, in, sections, of, his, famous, sketches, of, spain, collaboration, with, trumpeter, miles, davis, though, primarily, a, tenor, saxophone, and, flute, player, yusef, lateef, was, among, the, first, in, 1961, to, use, the, oboe, as, a, solo, instrument, in, modern, jazz, performances, and, recordings, composer, and, double, bassist, charles, mingus, gave, the, oboe, a, brief, but, prominent, role, played, by, dick, hafer, in, his, composition, i, x, love, on, the, 1963, album, mingus, mingus, mingus, mingus, mingus, with, the, birth, of, jazz, fusion, in, the, late, 1960s, and, its, continuous, development, through, the, following, decade, the, oboe, became, somewhat, more, prominent, replacing, on, some, occasions, the, saxophone, as, the, focal, point, the, oboe, was, used, with, great, success, by, the, welsh, multi, instrumentalist, karl, jenkins, in, his, work, with, the, groups, nucleus, and, soft, machine, and, by, the, american, woodwind, player, paul, mccandless, co, founder, of, the, paul, winter, consort, and, later, oregon, the, 1980s, saw, an, increasing, number, of, oboists, try, their, hand, at, non, classical, work, and, many, players, of, note, have, recorded, and, performed, alternative, music, on, oboe, some, present, day, jazz, groups, influenced, by, classical, music, such, as, the, maria, schneider, orchestra, feature, the, oboe, indie, singer, songwriter, and, composer, sufjan, stevens, having, studied, the, instrument, in, school, often, includes, the, instrument, in, his, arrangements, and, compositions, most, frequently, in, his, geographic, tone, poems, illinois, michigan, peter, gabriel, played, the, oboe, while, he, was, a, member, of, genesis, most, prominently, on, the, musical, box, andy, mackay, of, roxy, music, plays, oboe, sometimes, with, a, wah, wah, pedal, the, oboe, is, frequently, featured, in, film, music, often, to, underscore, a, particularly, poignant, or, emotional, scene, an, example, is, the, 1989, film, born, on, the, fourth, of, july, one, of, the, most, prominent, uses, of, the, oboe, in, a, film, score, is, ennio, morricone, s, gabriel, s, oboe, theme, from, the, 1986, film, the, mission, it, is, featured, as, a, solo, instrument, in, the, theme, across, the, stars, from, the, john, williams, score, to, the, 2002, film, star, wars, episode, ii, attack, of, the, clones, the, oboe, is, also, featured, as, a, solo, instrument, in, the, love, theme, in, nino, rota, s, score, to, the, godfather, 1972
