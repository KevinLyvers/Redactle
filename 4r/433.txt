space, for, actors, or, performers, and, a, focal, point, the, screen, in, cinema, theaters, for, the, audience, as, an, architectural, feature, the, stage, may, consist, of, a, platform, often, raised, or, series, of, platforms, in, some, cases, these, may, be, temporary, or, adjustable, but, in, theaters, and, other, buildings, devoted, to, such, productions, the, stage, is, often, a, permanent, feature, there, are, several, types, of, stages, that, vary, as, to, the, usage, and, the, relation, of, the, audience, to, them, the, most, common, form, found, in, the, west, is, the, proscenium, stage, in, this, type, the, audience, is, located, on, one, side, of, the, stage, with, the, remaining, sides, hidden, and, used, by, the, performers, and, technicians, thrust, stages, may, be, similar, to, proscenium, stages, but, with, a, platform, or, performance, area, that, extends, into, the, audience, space, so, that, the, audience, is, located, on, three, sides, in, theatre, in, the, round, the, audience, is, located, on, all, four, sides, of, the, stage, the, fourth, type, of, stage, incorporates, created, and, found, stages, which, may, be, constructed, specifically, for, a, performance, or, may, involve, a, space, that, is, adapted, as, a, stage, since, the, italian, renaissance, the, most, common, stage, used, in, the, west, has, been, the, proscenium, stage, which, may, also, be, referred, to, as, a, picture, frame, stage, the, primary, feature, is, a, large, opening, known, as, the, proscenium, arch, through, which, the, audience, views, the, performance, the, audience, directly, faces, the, stage, which, is, typically, raised, several, feet, above, front, row, audience, level, and, views, only, one, side, of, the, scene, this, one, side, is, commonly, known, as, the, invisible, fourth, wall, of, the, scene, the, proscenium, arch, evolved, from, the, proskenium, in, ancient, greek, theaters, this, was, the, space, in, front, of, the, sk, n, or, backdrop, where, the, actors, actually, played, the, first, indoor, theatres, were, created, in, french, tennis, courts, and, italian, renaissance, palaces, where, the, newly, embraced, principles, of, perspective, allowed, designers, to, create, stunning, vistas, with, buildings, and, trees, decreasing, in, size, toward, a, vanishing, point, on, the, horizon, stage, floors, were, raked, upward, slightly, from, front, to, back, in, order, to, contribute, to, the, perspective, illusion, and, also, to, make, actors, more, visible, to, audiences, who, were, seated, on, level, floors, subsequently, audience, seating, was, raked, and, balconies, were, added, to, give, audiences, a, fuller, view, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, most, stages, had, level, floors, and, much, of, the, audience, looked, down, on, rather, than, up, to, the, stage, the, competition, among, royals, to, produce, elegant, and, elaborate, entertainments, fueled, and, financed, the, expansion, of, european, court, theatres, the, proscenium, which, often, was, extremely, decorative, in, the, manner, of, a, triumphal, arch, framed, the, prospective, picture, the, desire, of, court, painters, to, show, more, than, one, of, their, perspective, backgrounds, led, court, architects, to, adapt, the, pin, rails, and, pulleys, of, sailing, ships, to, the, unrolling, and, later, to, the, lowering, and, raising, of, canvas, backdrops, a, wood, and, later, steel, grid, above, the, stage, supported, pulleys, from, which, wooden, battens, and, later, steel, pipes, rolled, down, or, descended, with, attached, scenery, pieces, the, weight, of, heavy, pieces, was, counterbalanced, by, sandbags, this, system, required, the, creation, of, a, storage, stage, house, or, loft, that, was, usually, as, high, or, higher, than, the, proscenium, itself, a, full, fly, stage, could, store, the, entire, height, of, scenery, above, the, visible, stage, using, the, pin, rails, before, or, during, performance, whereas, a, half, fly, stage, common, in, smaller, locations, could, only, store, props, of, limited, size, and, thus, required, more, careful, backdrop, and, scenery, design, theatres, using, these, rope, systems, which, are, manually, operated, by, stagehands, are, known, as, hemp, houses, they, have, been, largely, supplanted, by, counterweight, fly, systems, the, proscenium, in, conjunction, with, stage, curtains, called, legs, conceals, the, sides, of, the, stage, which, are, known, as, the, wings, the, wings, may, be, used, by, theatre, personnel, during, performances, and, as, storage, spaces, for, scenery, and, props, several, rows, of, short, curtains, across, the, top, of, the, stage, called, teasers, hide, the, backdrops, which, in, turn, are, hidden, above, the, stage, in, the, fly, system, loft, until, ready, for, use, often, a, stage, may, extend, in, front, of, the, proscenium, arch, which, offers, additional, playing, area, to, the, actors, this, area, is, referred, to, as, the, apron, underneath, and, in, front, of, the, apron, is, sometimes, an, orchestra, pit, which, is, used, by, musicians, during, musicals, and, operas, the, orchestra, pit, may, sometimes, be, covered, and, used, as, an, additional, playing, space, in, order, to, bring, the, actors, closer, to, the, audience, the, stage, is, often, raised, higher, than, the, audience, space, above, some, proscenium, stages, may, include, a, flyloft, where, curtains, scenery, and, battens, supporting, a, variety, of, lighting, instruments, may, hang, the, numerous, advantages, of, the, proscenium, stage, have, led, to, its, popularity, in, the, west, many, theatrical, properties, and, scenery, may, be, utilized, backdrops, curtains, and, lighting, can, be, used, to, greater, effect, without, risk, of, rigging, being, visible, to, the, audience, entrances, and, exits, can, be, made, more, graceful, surprise, becomes, possible, the, actors, only, have, to, concentrate, on, playing, to, the, audience, in, one, direction, boxes, are, a, feature, of, more, modern, stage, designs, in, which, temporary, walls, are, built, inside, any, proscenium, stage, at, a, slight, angle, to, the, original, walls, in, order, to, allow, audience, members, located, to, the, left, or, right, of, the, proscenium, the, further, out, the, larger, the, angle, to, see, the, entirety, of, the, stage, they, enable, rat, runs, around, the, back, of, the, stage, when, cast, members, have, to, move, between, exits, and, entrances, without, being, seen, by, the, audience, this, type, of, stage, is, located, in, the, centre, of, the, audience, with, the, audience, facing, it, from, all, sides, the, audience, is, placed, close, to, the, action, which, provides, a, feeling, of, intimacy, and, involvement, entrances, and, exits, of, characters, from, the, stage, if, any, must, be, through, the, audience, or, from, under, or, above, the, stage, in, the, round, stages, require, special, considerations, in, production, such, as, a, thrust, stage, is, one, that, extends, into, the, audience, on, three, sides, and, is, connected, to, the, backstage, area, by, its, upstage, end, a, thrust, has, the, benefit, of, greater, intimacy, between, the, audience, and, performers, than, a, proscenium, while, retaining, the, utility, of, a, backstage, area, entrances, onto, a, thrust, are, most, readily, made, from, backstage, although, some, theatres, provide, for, performers, to, enter, through, the, audience, using, vomitory, entrances, as, with, an, arena, the, audience, in, a, thrust, stage, theatre, may, view, the, stage, from, three, or, more, sides, if, a, performance, employs, the, fourth, wall, that, imaginary, wall, must, be, maintained, on, multiple, sides, similar, to, theatre, in, the, round, the, audience, can, view, the, performance, from, a, variety, of, perspectives, and, as, such, it, is, usual, for, the, blocking, props, and, scenery, to, receive, thorough, consideration, to, ensure, that, no, perspective, is, blocked, from, view, a, high, backed, chair, for, instance, when, placed, stage, right, could, create, a, blind, spot, in, the, stage, left, action, a, black, box, theater, consists, of, a, simple, yet, somewhat, unadorned, performance, space, ideally, a, large, square, room, with, black, walls, and, a, flat, floor, which, can, be, used, flexibly, to, create, a, stage, and, audience, area, a, stage, can, also, be, improvised, wherever, a, suitable, space, can, be, found, examples, may, include, staging, a, performance, in, a, non, traditional, space, such, as, a, basement, of, a, building, a, side, of, a, hill, or, in, the, case, of, a, busking, troupe, the, street, in, a, similar, manner, a, makeshift, stage, can, be, created, by, modifying, an, environment, for, example, demarcating, the, boundaries, of, a, stage, in, an, open, space, by, laying, a, carpet, and, arranging, seating, before, it, the, theater, company, shakespeare, in, the, park, in, fact, is, based, around, performing, shakespeare, plays, in, a, space, that, one, wouldn, t, likely, find, it, namely, central, park, in, new, york, city, areas, of, the, stage, are, assigned, names, to, facilitate, blocking, the, setting, out, of, the, precise, movement, and, positioning, of, actors, on, a, stage, to, an, actor, facing, the, audience, left, and, right, are, the, reverse, of, what, they, are, for, the, audience, to, prevent, confusion, actors, and, directors, never, use, the, unmarked, terms, left, or, right, for, the, sides, of, the, stage, rather, they, use, a, phrase, specifying, the, viewpoint, the, terms, stage, left, and, stage, right, respectively, denote, the, sides, of, the, stage, that, are, on, the, actor, s, left, and, right, when, the, actor, is, facing, the, audience, while, house, left, and, house, right, are, the, reverse, denoting, the, sides, of, the, stage, as, viewed, by, the, audience, in, germany, stage, right, and, left, are, reversed, being, the, director, s, view, rather, than, the, actor, s, less, ambiguous, terms, used, in, theatres, that, follow, a, british, tradition, are, prompt, side, or, p, side, stage, left, and, off, prompt, opposite, prompt, or, o, p, side, stage, right, relating, to, the, traditional, location, of, the, stage, manager, in, french, the, terms, c, t, cour, square, side, for, stage, left, and, c, t, jardin, garden, side, for, stage, right, are, used, in, reference, to, the, th, tre, des, tuileries, likewise, the, meaning, of, front, and, back, would, be, unclear, because, they, depend, on, perspective, instead, the, term, upstage, is, used, to, denote, the, part, of, the, stage, furthest, from, the, audience, or, to, motion, away, from, the, audience, while, downstage, denotes, the, portion, of, the, stage, closest, to, the, audience, or, to, motion, in, that, direction, these, terms, were, common, in, older, theatres, which, gave, the, audience, a, better, view, of, the, action, by, inclining, the, floor, known, as, a, raked, stage, so, upstage, actually, was, at, a, higher, elevation, than, downstage, a, raked, stage, can, vary, in, its, incline, ten, degrees, is, considered, ideal, for, the, audience, and, actor, comfort, a, dancing, surface, incline, is, often, different, from, an, acting, incline, and, can, vary, from, three, degrees, to, twenty, degrees, in, relationship, to, approaches, to, scenography, cultural, scenographer, rachel, hann, has, proposed, that, there, are, no, stages, without, scenographics, this, is, based, on, an, argument, that, all, stages, are, also, scenes, which, challenges, the, deterministic, assumption, that, stages, precede, scenography, in, this, model, stages, become, manifest, through, the, place, orientating, traits, of, scenographics, rather, than, the, other, way, around, the, implications, of, this, are, that, all, theatre, is, scenographic, even, if, it, has, no, defined, objects, or, setting, as, all, theatre, is, performed, on, a, stage, hann, summarises, this, position, by, using, the, hybrid, stage, scene, when, discussing, the, tensions, between, the, histories, of, these, practices, particularly, with, reference, to, original, greek, skene, as, a, physical, tent, or, hut, that, ultimately, shaped, current, conceptualizations, of, the, stage
