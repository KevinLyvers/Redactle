until, he, gets, captured, by, blackbeard, s, pirates, and, taken, to, neverland, here, he, wears, just, simple, clothes, peter, is, an, exaggerated, stereotype, of, a, boastful, and, careless, boy, he, claims, greatness, even, when, such, claims, are, questionable, such, as, congratulating, himself, when, wendy, re, attaches, his, shadow, in, the, play, and, book, peter, symbolises, the, selfishness, of, childhood, and, is, portrayed, as, being, forgetful, and, self, centred, peter, has, a, nonchalant, devil, may, care, attitude, and, is, fearlessly, cocky, when, it, comes, to, putting, himself, in, danger, barrie, writes, that, when, peter, thought, he, was, going, to, die, on, marooners, rock, he, felt, scared, yet, he, felt, only, one, shudder, with, this, blithe, attitude, he, says, to, die, will, be, an, awfully, big, adventure, in, the, play, the, unseen, and, unnamed, narrator, ponders, what, might, have, been, if, peter, had, stayed, with, wendy, so, that, his, cry, might, have, become, to, live, would, be, an, awfully, big, adventure, but, he, can, never, quite, get, the, hang, of, it, peter, s, archetypal, quality, is, his, unending, youth, in, peter, and, wendy, it, is, explained, that, peter, must, forget, his, own, adventures, and, what, he, learns, about, the, world, in, order, to, stay, childlike, peter, s, ability, to, fly, is, explained, but, inconsistently, in, the, little, white, bird, he, is, able, to, fly, because, he, is, said, to, be, part, bird, like, all, babies, in, the, play, and, novel, he, teaches, the, darling, children, to, fly, using, a, combination, of, lovely, wonderful, thoughts, and, fairy, dust, in, barrie, s, dedication, to, the, play, peter, pan, the, boy, who, wouldn, t, grow, up, the, author, attributes, the, idea, of, fairy, dust, being, necessary, for, flight, to, practical, needs, after, the, first, production, i, had, to, add, something, to, the, play, at, the, request, of, parents, who, thus, showed, that, they, thought, me, the, responsible, person, about, no, one, being, able, to, fly, until, the, fairy, dust, had, been, blown, on, him, so, many, children, having, gone, home, and, tried, it, from, their, beds, and, needed, surgical, attention, j, m, barrie, peter, has, an, effect, on, the, whole, of, neverland, and, its, inhabitants, when, he, is, there, barrie, states, that, although, neverland, appears, different, to, every, child, the, island, wakes, up, when, peter, returns, from, his, trip, to, london, in, the, chapter, the, mermaids, lagoon, in, the, book, peter, and, wendy, barrie, writes, that, there, is, almost, nothing, that, peter, cannot, do, he, is, a, skilled, swordsman, rivalling, even, captain, hook, whose, hand, he, cut, off, in, a, duel, he, has, remarkably, keen, vision, and, hearing, he, is, skilled, in, mimicry, copying, the, voice, of, hook, and, the, ticking, of, the, clock, in, the, crocodile, peter, has, the, ability, to, imagine, things, into, existence, and, he, is, able, to, sense, danger, when, it, is, near, in, peter, and, wendy, barrie, states, that, the, peter, pan, legend, mrs, darling, heard, as, a, child, was, that, when, children, died, he, accompanied, them, part, of, the, way, to, their, destination, so, they, would, not, be, frightened, in, the, original, play, peter, states, that, no, one, must, ever, touch, him, though, he, does, not, know, why, the, stage, directions, specify, that, no, one, does, so, throughout, the, play, wendy, approaches, peter, to, give, him, a, kiss, thimble, but, is, prevented, by, tinker, bell, however, john, caird, and, trevor, nunn, s, introduction, to, the, script, for, the, 1997, royal, national, theatre, production, states, that, this, was, never, barrie, s, original, intention, and, was, only, added, for, a, production, in, 1927, where, jean, forbes, robertson, took, the, title, role, and, played, the, part, with, a, lighter, more, fairy, like, physicality, robertson, was, to, play, the, part, almost, every, year, until, 1939, the, character, s, name, comes, from, two, sources, peter, llewelyn, davies, one, of, the, five, llewelyn, davies, boys, who, inspired, the, story, and, pan, a, minor, deity, of, greek, mythology, who, plays, pipes, to, nymphs, and, is, part, human, and, part, goat, this, is, referenced, in, barrie, s, works, particularly, peter, pan, in, kensington, gardens, where, peter, pan, plays, pipes, to, the, fairies, and, rides, a, goat, the, god, pan, represents, nature, or, man, s, natural, state, in, contrast, to, civilisation, and, the, effects, of, upbringing, on, human, behaviour, and, he, experienced, a, significant, revival, of, interest, among, english, artists, poets, and, novelists, during, the, edwardian, period, peter, pan, is, a, free, spirit, being, too, young, to, be, burdened, with, the, effects, of, education, or, to, have, an, adult, appreciation, of, moral, responsibility, as, a, betwixt, and, between, who, can, fly, and, speak, the, language, of, fairies, and, birds, peter, is, part, animal, and, part, human, according, to, psychologist, rosalind, ridley, by, comparing, peter, s, behaviour, to, adults, and, to, other, animals, barrie, raises, many, post, darwinian, questions, about, the, origins, of, human, nature, and, behaviour, as, the, boy, who, wouldn, t, grow, up, peter, exhibits, many, aspects, of, the, stages, of, cognitive, development, seen, in, children, and, can, be, regarded, as, barrie, s, memory, of, himself, as, a, child, being, both, charmingly, childlike, and, childishly, solipsistic, peter, pan, ran, away, from, his, parents, when, he, was, a, baby, as, told, in, peter, pan, in, kensington, gardens, and, peter, and, wendy, finding, the, window, closed, and, seeing, a, new, baby, boy, in, the, house, when, he, returned, some, time, later, he, believed, his, parents, no, longer, wanted, him, and, never, came, back, this, younger,
