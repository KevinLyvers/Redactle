the, elements, greek, stoikhe, a, is, a, mathematical, treatise, consisting, of, 13, books, attributed, to, the, ancient, greek, mathematician, euclid, c, 300, bc, it, is, a, collection, of, definitions, postulates, propositions, theorems, and, constructions, and, mathematical, proofs, of, the, propositions, the, books, cover, plane, and, solid, euclidean, geometry, elementary, number, theory, and, incommensurable, lines, elements, is, the, oldest, extant, large, scale, deductive, treatment, of, mathematics, it, has, proven, instrumental, in, the, development, of, logic, and, modern, science, and, its, logical, rigor, was, not, surpassed, until, the, 19th, century, euclid, s, elements, has, been, referred, to, as, the, most, successful, and, influential, textbook, ever, written, it, was, one, of, the, very, earliest, mathematical, works, to, be, printed, after, the, invention, of, the, printing, press, and, has, been, estimated, to, be, second, only, to, the, bible, in, the, number, of, editions, published, since, the, first, printing, in, 1482, the, number, reaching, well, over, one, thousand, for, centuries, when, the, quadrivium, was, included, in, the, curriculum, of, all, university, students, knowledge, of, at, least, part, of, euclid, s, elements, was, required, of, all, students, not, until, the, 20th, century, by, which, time, its, content, was, universally, taught, through, other, school, textbooks, did, it, cease, to, be, considered, something, all, educated, people, had, read, scholars, believe, that, the, elements, is, largely, a, compilation, of, propositions, based, on, books, by, earlier, greek, mathematicians, proclus, 412, 485, ad, a, greek, mathematician, who, lived, around, seven, centuries, after, euclid, wrote, in, his, commentary, on, the, elements, euclid, who, put, together, the, elements, collecting, many, of, eudoxus, theorems, perfecting, many, of, theaetetus, and, also, bringing, to, irrefragable, demonstration, the, things, which, were, only, somewhat, loosely, proved, by, his, predecessors, pythagoras, c, 570, 495, bc, was, probably, the, source, for, most, of, books, i, and, ii, hippocrates, of, chios, c, 470, 410, bc, not, the, better, known, hippocrates, of, kos, for, book, iii, and, eudoxus, of, cnidus, c, 408, 355, bc, for, book, v, while, books, iv, vi, xi, and, xii, probably, came, from, other, pythagorean, or, athenian, mathematicians, the, elements, may, have, been, based, on, an, earlier, textbook, by, hippocrates, of, chios, who, also, may, have, originated, the, use, of, letters, to, refer, to, figures, other, similar, works, are, also, reported, to, have, been, written, by, theudius, of, magnesia, leon, and, hermotimus, of, colophon, in, the, 4th, century, ad, theon, of, alexandria, produced, an, edition, of, euclid, which, was, so, widely, used, that, it, became, the, only, surviving, source, until, fran, ois, peyrard, s, 1808, discovery, at, the, vatican, of, a, manuscript, not, derived, from, theon, s, this, manuscript, the, heiberg, manuscript, is, from, a, byzantine, workshop, around, 900, and, is, the, basis, of, modern, editions, papyrus, oxyrhynchus, 29, is, a, tiny, fragment, of, an, even, older, manuscript, but, only, contains, the, statement, of, one, proposition, although, euclid, was, known, to, cicero, for, instance, no, record, exists, of, the, text, having, been, translated, into, latin, prior, to, boethius, in, the, fifth, or, sixth, century, the, arabs, received, the, elements, from, the, byzantines, around, 760, this, version, was, translated, into, arabic, under, harun, al, rashid, c, 800, the, byzantine, scholar, arethas, commissioned, the, copying, of, one, of, the, extant, greek, manuscripts, of, euclid, in, the, late, ninth, century, although, known, in, byzantium, the, elements, was, lost, to, western, europe, until, about, 1120, when, the, english, monk, adelard, of, bath, translated, it, into, latin, from, an, arabic, translation, a, relatively, recent, discovery, was, made, of, a, greek, to, latin, translation, from, the, 12th, century, at, palermo, sicily, the, name, of, the, translator, is, not, known, other, than, he, was, an, anonymous, medical, student, from, salerno, who, was, visiting, palermo, in, order, to, translate, the, almagest, to, latin, the, euclid, manuscript, is, extant, and, quite, complete, after, the, translation, by, adelard, of, bath, known, as, adelard, i, there, was, a, flurry, of, translations, from, arabic, notable, translators, in, this, period, include, herman, of, carinthia, who, wrote, an, edition, around, 1140, robert, of, chester, his, manuscripts, are, referred, to, collectively, as, adelard, ii, written, on, or, before, 1251, johannes, de, tinemue, possibly, also, known, as, john, of, tynemouth, his, manuscripts, are, referred, to, collectively, as, adelard, iii, late, 12th, century, and, gerard, of, cremona, sometime, after, 1120, but, before, 1187, the, exact, details, concerning, these, translations, is, still, an, active, area, of, research, campanus, of, novara, relied, heavily, on, these, arabic, translations, to, create, his, edition, sometime, before, 1260, which, ultimately, came, to, dominate, latin, editions, until, the, availability, of, greek, manuscripts, in, the, 16th, century, there, are, more, than, 100, pre, 1482, campanus, manuscripts, still, available, today, the, first, printed, edition, appeared, in, 1482, based, on, campanus, s, translation, and, since, then, it, has, been, translated, into, many, languages, and, published, in, about, a, thousand, different, editions, theon, s, greek, edition, was, recovered, and, published, in, 1533, based, on, paris, gr, 2343, and, venetus, marcianus, 301, in, 1570, john, dee, provided, a, widely, respected, mathematical, preface, along, with, copious, notes, and, supplementary, material, to, the, first, english, edition, by, henry, billingsley, copies, of, the, greek, text, still, exist, some, of, which, can, be, found, in, the, vatican, library, and, the, bodleian, library, in, oxford, the, manuscripts, available, are, of, variable, quality, and, invariably, incomplete, by, careful, analysis, of, the, translations, and, originals, hypotheses, have, been, made, about, the, contents, of, the, original, text, copies, of, which, are, no, longer, available, ancient, texts, which, refer, to, the, elements, itself, and, to, other, mathematical, theories, that, were, current, at, the, time, it, was, written, are, also, important, in, this, process, such, analyses, are, conducted, by, j, l, heiberg, and, sir, thomas, little, heath, in, their, editions, of, the, text, also, of, importance, are, the, scholia, or, annotations, to, the, text, these, additions, which, often, distinguished, themselves, from, the, main, text, depending, on, the, manuscript, gradually, accumulated, over, time, as, opinions, varied, upon, what, was, worthy, of, explanation, or, further, study, the, elements, is, still, considered, a, masterpiece, in, the, application, of, logic, to, mathematics, in, historical, context, it, has, proven, enormously, influential, in, many, areas, of, science, scientists, nicolaus, copernicus, johannes, kepler, galileo, galilei, albert, einstein, and, sir, isaac, newton, were, all, influenced, by, the, elements, and, applied, their, knowledge, of, it, to, their, work, mathematicians, and, philosophers, such, as, thomas, hobbes, baruch, spinoza, alfred, north, whitehead, and, bertrand, russell, have, attempted, to, create, their, own, foundational, elements, for, their, respective, disciplines, by, adopting, the, axiomatized, deductive, structures, that, euclid, s, work, introduced, the, austere, beauty, of, euclidean, geometry, has, been, seen, by, many, in, western, culture, as, a, glimpse, of, an, otherworldly, system, of, perfection, and, certainty, abraham, lincoln, kept, a, copy, of, euclid, in, his, saddlebag, and, studied, it, late, at, night, by, lamplight, he, related, that, he, said, to, himself, you, never, can, make, a, lawyer, if, you, do, not, understand, what, demonstrate, means, and, i, left, my, situation, in, springfield, went, home, to, my, father, s, house, and, stayed, there, till, i, could, give, any, proposition, in, the, six, books, of, euclid, at, sight, edna, st, vincent, millay, wrote, in, her, sonnet, euclid, alone, has, looked, on, beauty, bare, o, blinding, hour, o, holy, terrible, day, when, first, the, shaft, into, his, vision, shone, of, light, anatomized, albert, einstein, recalled, a, copy, of, the, elements, and, a, magnetic, compass, as, two, gifts, that, had, a, great, influence, on, him, as, a, boy, referring, to, the, euclid, as, the, holy, little, geometry, book, the, success, of, the, elements, is, due, primarily, to, its, logical, presentation, of, most, of, the, mathematical, knowledge, available, to, euclid, much, of, the, material, is, not, original, to, him, although, many, of, the, proofs, are, his, however, euclid, s, systematic, development, of, his, subject, from, a, small, set, of, axioms, to, deep, results, and, the, consistency, of, his, approach, throughout, the, elements, encouraged, its, use, as, a, textbook, for, about, 2, 000, years, the, elements, still, influences, modern, geometry, books, furthermore, its, logical, axiomatic, approach, and, rigorous, proofs, remain, the, cornerstone, of, mathematics, one, of, the, most, notable, influences, of, euclid, on, modern, mathematics, is, the, discussion, of, the, parallel, postulate, in, book, i, euclid, lists, five, postulates, the, fifth, of, which, stipulates, if, a, line, segment, intersects, two, straight, lines, forming, two, interior, angles, on, the, same, side, that, sum, to, less, than, two, right, angles, then, the, two, lines, if, extended, indefinitely, meet, on, that, side, on, which, the, angles, sum, to, less, than, two, right, angles, this, postulate, plagued, mathematicians, for, centuries, due, to, its, apparent, complexity, compared, with, the, other, four, postulates, many, attempts, were, made, to, prove, the, fifth, postulate, based, on, the, other, four, but, they, never, succeeded, eventually, in, 1829, mathematician, nikolai, lobachevsky, published, a, description, of, acute, geometry, or, hyperbolic, geometry, a, geometry, which, assumed, a, different, form, of, the, parallel, postulate, it, is, in, fact, possible, to, create, a, valid, geometry, without, the, fifth, postulate, entirely, or, with, different, versions, of, the, fifth, postulate, elliptic, geometry, if, one, takes, the, fifth, postulate, as, a, given, the, result, is, euclidean, geometry, to, draw, a, straight, line, from, any, point, to, any, point, to, describe, a, circle, with, any, center, and, distance, euclid, elements, book, i, postulates, 1, 3, euclid, s, axiomatic, approach, and, constructive, methods, were, widely, influential, many, of, euclid, s, propositions, were, constructive, demonstrating, the, existence, of, some, figure, by, detailing, the, steps, he, used, to, construct, the, object, using, a, compass, and, straightedge, his, constructive, approach, appears, even, in, his, geometry, s, postulates, as, the, first, and, third, postulates, stating, the, existence, of, a, line, and, circle, are, constructive, instead, of, stating, that, lines, and, circles, exist, per, his, prior, definitions, he, states, that, it, is, possible, to, construct, a, line, and, circle, it, also, appears, that, for, him, to, use, a, figure, in, one, of, his, proofs, he, needs, to, construct, it, in, an, earlier, proposition, for, example, he, proves, the, pythagorean, theorem, by, first, inscribing, a, square, on, the, sides, of, a, right, triangle, but, only, after, constructing, a, square, on, a, given, line, one, proposition, earlier, as, was, common, in, ancient, mathematical, texts, when, a, proposition, needed, proof, in, several, different, cases, euclid, often, proved, only, one, of, them, often, the, most, difficult, leaving, the, others, to, the, reader, later, editors, such, as, theon, often, interpolated, their, own, proofs, of, these, cases, euclid, s, presentation, was, limited, by, the, mathematical, ideas, and, notations, in, common, currency, in, his, era, and, this, causes, the, treatment, to, seem, awkward, to, the, modern, reader, in, some, places, for, example, there, was, no, notion, of, an, angle, greater, than, two, right, angles, the, number, 1, was, sometimes, treated, separately, from, other, positive, integers, and, as, multiplication, was, treated, geometrically, he, did, not, use, the, product, of, more, than, 3, different, numbers, the, geometrical, treatment, of, number, theory, may, have, been, because, the, alternative, would, have, been, the, extremely, awkward, alexandrian, system, of, numerals, the, presentation, of, each, result, is, given, in, a, stylized, form, which, although, not, invented, by, euclid, is, recognized, as, typically, classical, it, has, six, different, parts, first, is, the, enunciation, which, states, the, result, in, general, terms, i, e, the, statement, of, the, proposition, then, comes, the, setting, out, which, gives, the, figure, and, denotes, particular, geometrical, objects, by, letters, next, comes, the, definition, or, specification, which, restates, the, enunciation, in, terms, of, the, particular, figure, then, the, construction, or, machinery, follows, here, the, original, figure, is, extended, to, forward, the, proof, then, the, proof, itself, follows, finally, the, conclusion, connects, the, proof, to, the, enunciation, by, stating, the, specific, conclusions, drawn, in, the, proof, in, the, general, terms, of, the, enunciation, no, indication, is, given, of, the, method, of, reasoning, that, led, to, the, result, although, the, data, does, provide, instruction, about, how, to, approach, the, types, of, problems, encountered, in, the, first, four, books, of, the, elements, some, scholars, have, tried, to, find, fault, in, euclid, s, use, of, figures, in, his, proofs, accusing, him, of, writing, proofs, that, depended, on, the, specific, figures, drawn, rather, than, the, general, underlying, logic, especially, concerning, proposition, ii, of, book, i, however, euclid, s, original, proof, of, this, proposition, is, general, valid, and, does, not, depend, on, the, figure, used, as, an, example, to, illustrate, one, given, configuration, euclid, s, list, of, axioms, in, the, elements, was, not, exhaustive, but, represented, the, principles, that, were, the, most, important, his, proofs, often, invoke, axiomatic, notions, which, were, not, originally, presented, in, his, list, of, axioms, later, editors, have, interpolated, euclid, s, implicit, axiomatic, assumptions, in, the, list, of, formal, axioms, for, example, in, the, first, construction, of, book, 1, euclid, used, a, premise, that, was, neither, postulated, nor, proved, that, two, circles, with, centers, at, the, distance, of, their, radius, will, intersect, in, two, points, later, in, the, fourth, construction, he, used, superposition, moving, the, triangles, on, top, of, each, other, to, prove, that, if, two, sides, and, their, angles, are, equal, then, they, are, congruent, during, these, considerations, he, uses, some, properties, of, superposition, but, these, properties, are, not, described, explicitly, in, the, treatise, if, superposition, is, to, be, considered, a, valid, method, of, geometric, proof, all, of, geometry, would, be, full, of, such, proofs, for, example, propositions, i, 2, and, i, 3, can, be, proved, trivially, by, using, superposition, mathematician, and, historian, w, w, rouse, ball, put, the, criticisms, in, perspective, remarking, that, the, fact, that, for, two, thousand, years, was, the, usual, text, book, on, the, subject, raises, a, strong, presumption, that, it, is, not, unsuitable, for, that, purpose, it, was, not, uncommon, in, ancient, times, to, attribute, to, celebrated, authors, works, that, were, not, written, by, them, it, is, by, these, means, that, the, apocryphal, books, xiv, and, xv, of, the, elements, were, sometimes, included, in, the, collection, the, spurious, book, xiv, was, probably, written, by, hypsicles, on, the, basis, of, a, treatise, by, apollonius, the, book, continues, euclid, s, comparison, of, regular, solids, inscribed, in, spheres, with, the, chief, result, being, that, the, ratio, of, the, surfaces, of, the, dodecahedron, and, icosahedron, inscribed, in, the, same, sphere, is, the, same, as, the, ratio, of, their, volumes, the, ratio, being, 10, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, displaystyle, sqrt, frac, 10, 3, 5, sqrt, 5, sqrt, frac, 5, sqrt, 5, 6, the, spurious, book, xv, was, probably, written, at, least, in, part, by, isidore, of, miletus, this, book, covers, topics, such, as, counting, the, number, of, edges, and, solid, angles, in, the, regular, solids, and, finding, the, measure, of, dihedral, angles, of, faces, that, meet, at, an, edge
