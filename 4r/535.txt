folk, art, covers, all, forms, of, visual, art, made, in, the, context, of, folk, culture, definitions, vary, but, generally, the, objects, have, practical, utility, of, some, kind, rather, than, being, exclusively, decorative, the, makers, of, folk, art, are, typically, trained, within, a, popular, tradition, rather, than, in, the, fine, art, tradition, of, the, culture, there, is, often, overlap, or, contested, ground, with, naive, art, folk, art, is, not, used, in, regard, to, traditional, societies, where, ethnographic, art, continue, to, be, made, the, types, of, objects, covered, by, the, term, folk, art, vary, the, art, form, is, categorised, as, divergent, of, cultural, production, comprehended, by, its, usage, in, europe, where, the, term, originated, and, in, the, united, states, where, it, developed, for, the, most, part, along, very, different, lines, from, a, european, perspective, edward, lucie, smith, described, it, as, unsophisticated, art, both, fine, and, applied, which, is, supposedly, rooted, in, the, collective, awareness, of, simple, people, the, concept, of, folk, art, is, a, distinctly, 19th, century, one, today, it, carries, with, it, a, tinge, of, nostalgia, for, pre, industrial, society, folk, arts, reflect, the, cultural, life, of, a, community, the, art, form, encompasses, the, expressive, culture, associated, with, the, fields, of, folklore, and, cultural, heritage, tangible, folk, art, can, include, objects, which, historically, are, crafted, and, used, within, a, traditional, community, intangible, folk, arts, can, include, such, forms, as, music, and, art, galleries, dance, and, narrative, structures, each, of, these, art, forms, both, tangible, and, intangible, typically, were, developed, to, address, a, practical, purpose, once, the, purpose, has, been, lost, or, forgotten, there, usually, is, no, reason, for, further, transmission, unless, the, object, or, action, has, been, imbued, with, meaning, beyond, its, initial, practicality, these, artistic, traditions, are, shaped, by, values, and, standards, that, are, passed, from, generation, to, generation, most, often, within, family, and, community, through, demonstration, conversation, and, practice, objects, of, folk, art, are, a, subset, of, material, culture, and, include, objects, which, are, experienced, through, the, senses, by, seeing, and, touching, typical, for, material, culture, in, art, these, tangible, objects, can, be, handled, repeatedly, re, experienced, and, sometimes, broken, they, are, considered, works, of, art, because, of, the, technical, execution, of, an, existing, form, and, design, the, skill, might, be, seen, in, the, precision, of, the, form, the, surface, decoration, or, in, the, beauty, of, the, finished, product, as, a, folk, art, these, objects, share, several, characteristics, that, distinguish, them, from, other, artifacts, of, material, culture, the, object, is, created, by, a, single, artisan, or, team, of, artisans, the, craft, person, works, within, an, established, cultural, framework, the, folk, art, has, a, recognizable, style, and, method, in, crafting, its, pieces, which, allows, products, to, be, recognized, and, attributed, to, a, single, individual, or, workshop, this, was, originally, articulated, by, alois, riegl, in, his, study, of, volkskunst, hausfleiss, und, hausindustrie, published, in, 1894, riegl, stressed, that, the, individual, hand, and, intentions, of, the, artist, were, significant, even, in, folk, creativity, to, be, sure, the, artist, may, have, been, obliged, by, group, expectations, to, work, within, the, norms, of, transmitted, forms, and, conventions, but, individual, creativity, which, implied, personal, aesthetic, choices, and, technical, virtuosity, saved, received, or, inherited, traditions, from, stagnating, and, permitted, them, to, be, renewed, in, each, generation, individual, innovation, in, the, production, process, plays, an, important, role, in, the, continuance, of, these, traditional, forms, many, folk, art, traditions, like, quilting, ornamental, picture, framing, and, decoy, carving, continue, to, be, practiced, and, new, forms, continue, to, emerge, contemporary, outsider, artists, are, often, self, taught, and, their, work, is, usually, developed, in, isolation, or, in, small, communities, across, the, country, the, smithsonian, american, art, museum, houses, over, 70, folk, and, self, taught, artists, folk, art, objects, are, usually, produced, in, a, one, off, production, process, only, one, object, is, made, at, a, time, either, by, hand, or, in, a, combination, of, hand, and, machine, methods, and, are, not, mass, produced, as, a, result, of, manual, production, individual, pieces, are, considered, to, be, unique, and, usually, can, be, differentiated, from, other, objects, of, the, same, type, in, his, essay, on, folk, objects, folklorist, simon, bronner, references, preindustrial, modes, of, production, but, folk, art, objects, continue, to, be, made, as, unique, crafted, pieces, by, folk, artisans, the, notion, of, folk, objects, tends, to, emphasize, the, handmade, over, machine, manufactured, folk, objects, imply, a, mode, of, production, common, to, preindustrial, communal, society, where, knowledge, and, skills, were, personal, and, traditional, folk, art, does, not, need, to, be, old, it, continues, to, be, hand, crafted, today, in, many, regions, around, the, world, the, design, and, production, of, folk, art, is, learned, and, taught, informally, or, formally, folk, artists, are, not, self, taught, folk, art, does, not, aim, for, individualistic, expression, instead, the, concept, of, group, art, implies, indeed, requires, that, artists, acquire, their, abilities, both, manual, and, intellectual, at, least, in, part, from, communication, with, others, the, community, has, something, usually, a, great, deal, to, say, about, what, passes, for, acceptable, folk, art, historically, the, training, in, a, handicraft, was, done, as, apprenticeships, with, local, craftsmen, such, as, the, blacksmith, or, the, stonemason, as, the, equipment, and, tools, needed, were, no, longer, readily, available, in, the, community, these, traditional, crafts, moved, into, technical, schools, or, applied, arts, schools, teaching, of, the, craft, through, informal, means, outside, of, institutions, has, opened, the, genre, to, artists, who, may, face, barrier, to, entry, in, other, disciplines, canadian, folk, artist, maud, lewis, for, example, suffered, from, an, undiagnosed, congenital, illness, making, formal, art, schooling, a, challenge, despite, barriers, to, formal, education, lewis, became, one, of, canada, s, most, famous, folk, artists, creating, thousands, of, paintings, of, life, in, nova, scotia, the, object, is, recognizable, within, its, cultural, framework, as, being, of, a, known, type, similar, objects, can, be, found, in, the, environment, made, by, other, individuals, which, resemble, this, object, individual, pieces, of, folk, art, will, reference, other, works, in, the, culture, even, as, they, show, exceptional, individual, execution, in, form, or, design, if, antecedents, cannot, be, found, for, this, object, it, might, still, be, a, piece, of, art, but, it, is, not, folk, art, while, traditional, society, does, not, erase, ego, it, does, focus, and, direct, the, choices, that, an, individual, can, acceptably, make, the, well, socialized, person, will, find, the, limits, are, not, inhibiting, but, helpful, where, traditions, are, healthy, the, works, of, different, artists, are, more, similar, than, they, are, different, they, are, more, uniform, than, personal, tradition, in, folk, art, emerges, through, the, passing, of, information, from, one, generation, to, another, through, generations, of, family, lines, family, members, pass, down, the, knowledge, information, skills, and, tools, needed, to, continue, the, creation, of, one, s, folk, art, examples, are, leon, peck, clark, a, mississippi, basket, maker, who, learned, his, skills, from, a, community, member, george, lopez, of, cordova, new, mexico, who, is, a, sixth, generation, santos, carver, whose, children, also, carve, and, the, yorok, karok, basket, weavers, who, explain, that, relatives, generally, taught, them, to, weave, the, known, type, of, the, object, must, be, or, have, originally, been, utilitarian, it, was, created, to, serve, some, function, in, the, daily, life, of, the, household, or, the, community, this, is, the, reason, the, design, continues, to, be, made, since, the, form, itself, had, function, and, purpose, it, was, duplicated, over, time, in, various, locations, by, different, individuals, a, book, on, the, history, of, art, states, that, every, man, made, thing, arises, from, a, problem, as, a, purposeful, solution, written, by, george, kubler, and, published, in, 1962, the, shape, of, time, remarks, on, the, history, of, things, describes, an, approach, to, historical, change, which, places, the, history, of, objects, and, images, in, a, larger, continuum, of, time, the, purpose, of, folk, art, is, not, purely, decorative, or, aimed, to, have, duplicated, handicraft, however, since, the, form, itself, was, a, distinct, type, with, its, function, and, purpose, folk, art, has, continued, to, be, copied, over, time, by, different, individuals, the, object, is, recognized, as, being, exceptional, in, the, form, and, decorative, motifs, being, part, of, the, community, the, craftsperson, is, reflecting, on, the, community, s, cultural, aesthetics, and, may, take, into, consideration, the, community, s, response, to, the, handicraft, an, object, can, be, created, to, match, the, community, s, expectations, and, the, artist, may, design, the, product, with, unspoken, cultural, biases, to, reflect, this, aim, while, the, shared, form, indicates, a, shared, culture, innovation, can, enable, the, individual, artisan, to, embody, their, own, vision, this, can, be, a, representation, of, manipulating, collective, and, individual, culture, within, the, traditional, folk, art, production, for, art, to, progress, its, unity, must, be, dismantled, so, that, certain, of, its, aspects, can, be, freed, for, exploration, while, others, shrink, from, attention, this, dichotomous, representation, of, the, culture, is, typically, visible, in, the, final, product, folk, art, is, designed, in, different, shapes, sizes, and, forms, it, traditionally, uses, the, materials, which, are, at, hand, in, the, locality, and, reproduces, familiar, shapes, and, forms, the, smithsonian, center, for, folklife, and, cultural, heritage, has, compiled, a, page, of, storied, objects, that, have, been, part, of, one, of, their, annual, folklife, festivals, the, list, below, includes, a, sampling, of, different, materials, forms, and, artisans, involved, in, the, production, of, everyday, and, folk, art, objects, listed, below, are, a, wide, ranging, assortment, of, labels, for, an, eclectic, group, of, art, works, all, of, these, genres, are, created, outside, of, the, institutional, structures, of, the, art, world, and, are, not, considered, fine, art, there, is, overlap, between, these, labeled, collections, such, that, an, object, might, be, listed, under, two, or, more, labels, many, of, these, groupings, and, individual, objects, might, also, resemble, folk, art, in, its, aspects, however, may, not, align, to, the, defining, characteristics, outlined, above, folk, artworks, styles, and, motifs, have, inspired, various, artists, for, example, pablo, picasso, was, inspired, by, african, tribal, sculptures, and, masks, natalia, goncharova, and, others, were, inspired, by, traditional, russian, popular, prints, called, luboks, in, 1951, artist, writer, and, curator, barbara, jones, organised,
