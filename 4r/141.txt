form, of, journey, to, the, west, dates, from, the, 16th, century, embellished, stories, based, on, xuanzang, s, journey, to, india, had, circulated, through, oral, storytelling, for, centuries, they, appeared, in, book, form, as, early, as, the, southern, song, dynasty, 1127, 1279, the, yongle, encyclopedia, completed, in, 1408, contains, excerpts, of, a, version, of, the, story, written, in, colloquial, chinese, and, a, korean, book, from, 1423, also, includes, a, fragment, of, that, story, the, earliest, surviving, edition, of, journey, to, the, west, was, published, in, nanjing, in, 1592, two, earlier, editions, were, published, between, 1522, and, 1566, but, no, copies, of, them, survived, the, authorship, of, journey, to, the, west, is, traditionally, ascribed, to, wu, cheng, en, but, the, question, is, complicated, by, the, fact, that, much, of, the, novel, s, material, originated, from, folk, tales, anthony, c, yu, writing, in, 2012, warned, that, this, vexing, dispute, over, the, novel, s, authorship, similar, to, that, on, the, priority, of, its, textual, versions, see, sawed, back, and, forth, for, nearly, a, century, without, resolution, hu, shih, literary,

anonymously, by, wu, cheng, en, he, reasoned, that, the, people, of, wu, s, hometown, attributed, it, to, him, early, on, and, kept, records, to, that, effect, as, early, as, 1625, thus, claimed, hu, journey, to, the, west, was, one, of, the, earliest, chinese, novels, for, which, the, authorship, is, officially, documented, more, recent, scholarship, casts, doubts, on, this, attribution, brown, university, chinese, literature, scholar, david, lattimore, stated, in, 1983, the, ambassador, s, confidence, was, quite, unjustified, what, the, gazetteer, says, is, that, wu, wrote, something, called, the, journey, to, the, west, it, mentions, nothing, about, a, novel, the, work, in, question, could, have, been, any, version, of, our, story, or, something, else, entirely, translator, w, j, f, jenner, pointed, out, that, although, wu, had, knowledge, of, chinese, bureaucracy, and, politics, the, novel, itself, does, not, include, any, political, details, that, a, fairly, well, read, commoner, could, not, have, known, one, interpretive, tradition, views, journey, to, the, west, as, the, outcome, of, a, writing, game, which, was, popular, among, chinese, literati, 157, the,

six, part, drama, play, series, which, was, transcribed, and, written, down, before, the, current, version, was, written, fragments, of, an, earlier, text, journey, to, the, west, as, storytelling, are, recorded, in, other, texts, 159, the, narrative, threads, from, this, earlier, text, which, survive, are, the, wager, between, the, dragon, king, of, the, jing, river, and, fortune, teller, yuan, shoucheng, and, the, contest, between, the, pilgrims, and, the, three, taoist, demons, in, cart, slow, kingdom, 159, regardless, of, the, origins, and, authorship, journey, to, the, west, has, become, the, authoritative, version, of, these, folk, stories, and, while, the, cumulative, authorship, of, the, text, is, acknowledged, wu, is, generally, accepted, as, the, author, of, the, 1592, printed, version, widely, considered, canonical, 158, although, journey, to, the, west, is, a, work, of, fantasy, it, is, based, on, the, actual, journey, of, the, chinese, monk, xuanzang, 602, 664, who,
