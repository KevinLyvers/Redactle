of, the, world, s, knowledge, into, the, encyclop, die, and, hoped, that, the, text, could, disseminate, all, this, information, to, the, public, and, future, generations, thus, it, is, an, example, of, democratization, of, knowledge, it, was, also, the, first, encyclopedia, to, include, contributions, from, many, named, contributors, and, it, was, the, first, general, encyclopedia, to, describe, the, mechanical, arts, in, the, first, publication, seventeen, folio, volumes, were, accompanied, by, detailed, engravings, later, volumes, were, published, without, the, engravings, in, order, to,

had, emerged, in, europe, since, the, late, 17th, century, this, work, became, quite, renowned, and, four, editions, were, published, between, 1738, and, 1742, an, italian, translation, appeared, between, 1747, and, 1754, in, france, a, member, of, the, banking, family, lambert, had, started, translating, chambers, into, french, but, in, 1745, the, expatriate, englishman, john, mills, and, german, gottfried, sellius, were, the, first, to, actually, prepare, a, french, edition, of, ephraim, chambers, s, cyclopaedia, for, publication, which, they, entitled, encyclop, die, early, in, 1745, a, prospectus, for, the, encyclop, die, was, published, to, attract, subscribers, to, the, project, this, four, page, prospectus, was, illustrated, by, jean, michel, papillon, and, accompanied, by, a, plan, stating, that, the, work, would, be, published, in, five, volumes, from, june, 1746, until, the, end, of, 1748, the, text, was, translated, by, mills, and, sellius, and, it, was, corrected, by, an, unnamed, person, who, appears, to, have, been, denis, diderot, the, prospectus, was, reviewed, quite, positively, and, cited, at, some, length, in, several, journals, the, m, moires, pour, l, histoire, des, sciences, et, des, beaux, arts, journal, was, lavish, in, its, praise, here, are, two, of, the, greatest, efforts, undertaken, in, literature, in, a, very, long, time, voici, deux, des, plus, fortes, entreprises, de, litt, rature, qu, on, ait, faites, depuis, long, temps, the, mercure, journal, in, june, 1745, printed, a, 25, page, article, that, specifically, praised, mills, role, as, translator, the, journal, introduced, mills, as, an, english, scholar, who, had, been, raised, in, france, and, who, spoke, both, french, and, english, as, a, native, the, journal, reported, that, mills, had, discussed, the, work, with, several, academics, was, zealous, about, the, project, had, devoted, his, fortune, to, support, this, enterprise, and, was, the, sole, owner, of, the, publishing, privilege, however, the, cooperation, fell, apart, later, on, in, 1745, andr, le, breton, the, publisher, commissioned, to, manage, the, physical, production, and, sales, of, the, volumes, cheated, mills, out, of, the, subscription, money, claiming, for, example, that, mills, s, knowledge, of, french, was, inadequate, in, a, confrontation, le, breton, physically, assaulted, mills, mills, took, le, breton, to, court, but, the, court, decided, in, le, breton, s, favour, mills, returned, to, england, soon, after, the, court, s, ruling, for, his, new, editor, le, breton, settled, on, the, mathematician, jean, paul, de, gua, de, malves, among, those, hired, by, malves, were, the, young, tienne, bonnot, de, condillac, jean, le, rond, d, alembert, and, denis, diderot, within, thirteen, months, in, august, 1747, gua, de, malves, was, fired, for, being, an, ineffective, leader, le, breton, then, hired, diderot, and, d, alembert, to, be, the, new, editors, diderot, would, remain, as, editor, for, the, next, 25, years, seeing, the, encyclop, die, through, to, its, completion, d, alembert, would, leave, this, role, in, 1758, as, d, alembert, worked, on, the, encyclop, die, its, title, expanded, as, of, 1750, the, full, title, was, encyclop, die, ou, dictionnaire, raisonn, des, sciences, des, arts, et, des, m, tiers, par, une, soci, t, de, gens, de, lettres, mis, en, ordre, par, m, diderot, de, l, acad, mie, des, sciences, et, belles, lettres, de, prusse, et, quant, la, partie, math, matique, par, m, d, alembert, de, l, acad, mie, royale, des, sciences, de,

edited, by, m, diderot, of, the, academy, of, sciences, and, belles, lettres, of, prussia, as, to, the, mathematical, portion, arranged, by, m, d, alembert, of, the, royal, academy, of, sciences, of, paris, of, the, academy, of, sciences, in, prussia, and, of, the, royal, society, of, london, the, title, page, was, amended, as, d, alembert, acquired, more, titles, the, work, consisted, of, 28, volumes, with, 71, 818, articles, and, 3, 129, illustrations, the, first, seventeen, volumes, were, published, between, 1751, and, 1765, eleven, volumes, of, plates, were, finished, by, 1772, engraver, robert, b, nard, provided, at, least, 1, 800, plates, for, the, work, the, encyclop, die, sold, 4, 000, copies, during, its, first, twenty, years, of, publication, and, earned, a, profit, of, 2, million, livres, for, its, investors, because, of, its, occasional, radical, contents, the, encyclop, die, caused, much, controversy, in, conservative, circles, and, after, the, publication, of, the, second, volume, it, was, briefly, suspended, from, publishing, by, royal, edict, of, 1752, joly, de, fleury, accused, it, of, destroying, royal, authority, fomenting, a, spirit, of, independence, and, revolt, and, laying, the, foundations, of, an, edifice, of, error, for, the, corruption, of, morals, and, religion, and, the, promotion, of, unbelief, following, the, publication, of, the, seventh, volume, on, the, initiative, of, the, parlement, of, paris, the, french, government, suspended, the, encyclopedia, s, privil, ge, in, 1759, despite, these, issues, work, continued, in, secret, partially, because, the, project, had, highly, placed, supporters, such, as, malesherbes, and, madame, de, pompadour, the, authorities, deliberately, ignored, the, continued, work, they, thought, their, official, ban, was, sufficient, to, appease, the, church, and, other, enemies, of, the, project, during, the, secretive, period, diderot, accomplished, a, work, of, subterfuge, the, title, pages, of, volumes, 1, through, 7, published, between, 1751, and, 1757, claimed, paris, as, the, place, of, publication, however, the, title, pages, of, the, subsequent, text, volumes, 8, through, 17, published, together, in, 1765, show, neufchastel, as, the, place, of, publication, neuch, tel, is, safely, across, the, french, border, in, what, is, now, part, of, switzerland, but, which, was, then, an, independent, principality, where, official, production, of, the, encyclop, die, was, secure, from, interference, by, agents, of, the, french, state, in, particular, regime, opponents, of, the, encyclop, die, could, not, seize, the, production, plates, for, the, encyclop, die, in, paris, because, those, printing, plates, ostensibly, existed, only, in, switzerland, meanwhile, the, actual, production, of, volumes, 8, through, 17, quietly, continued, in, paris, in, 1775, charles, joseph, panckoucke, obtained, the, rights, to, reissue, the, work, he, issued, five, volumes, of, supplementary, material, and, a, two, volume, index, from, 1776, to, 1780, some, scholars, include, these, seven, extra, volumes, as, part, of, the, first, full, issue, of, the, encyclop, die, for, a, total, of, 35, volumes, although, they, were, not, written, or, edited, by, the, original, authors, from, 1782, to, 1832, panckoucke, and, his, successors, published, an, expanded, edition, of, the, work, in, some, 166, volumes, as, the, encyclop, die, m, thodique, that, work, enormous, for, its, time, occupied, a, thousand, workers, in, production, and, 2, 250, contributors, since, the, objective, of, the, editors, of, the, encyclop, die, was, to, gather, all, the, knowledge, in, the, world, diderot, and, d, alembert, knew, they, would, need, various, contributors, to, help, them, with, their, project, many, of, the, philosophes, intellectuals, of, the, french, enlightenment, contributed, to, the, encyclop, die, including, diderot, himself, voltaire, rousseau, and, montesquieu, the, most, prolific, contributor, was, louis, de, jaucourt, who, wrote, 17, 266, articles, between, 1759, and, 1765, or, about, eight, per, day, representing, a, full, 25, of, the, encyclop, die, the, publication, became, a, place, where, these, contributors, could, share, their, ideas, and, interests, still, as, frank, kafker, has, argued, the, encyclopedists, were, not, a, unified, group, despite, their, reputation, were, not, a, close, knit, group, of, radicals, intent, on, subverting, the, old, regime, in, france, instead, they, were, a, disparate, group, of, men, of, letters, physicians, scientists, craftsmen, and, scholars, even, the, small, minority, who, were, persecuted, for, writing, articles, belittling, what, they, viewed, as, unreasonable, customs, thus, weakening, the, might, of, the, catholic, church, and, undermining, that, of, the, monarchy, did, not, envision, that, their, ideas, would, encourage, a, revolution, following, is, a, list, of, notable, contributors, with, their, area, of, contribution, for, a, more, detailed, list, see, encyclop, distes, due, to, the, controversial, nature, of, some, of, the, articles, several, of, its, editors, were, sent, to, jail, like, most, encyclopedias, the, encyclop, die, attempted, to, collect, and, summarize, human, knowledge, in, a, variety, of, fields, and, topics, ranging, from, philosophy, to, theology, to, science, and, the, arts, the, encyclop, die, was, controversial, for, reorganizing, knowledge, based, on, human, reason, instead, of, by, nature, or, theology, knowledge, and, intellect, branched, from, the, three, categories, of, human, thought, whereas, all, other, perceived, aspects, of, knowledge, including, theology, were, simply, branches, or, components, of, these, human, made, categories, the, introduction, to, the, encyclop, die, d, alembert, s, preliminary, discourse, is, considered, an, important, exposition, of, enlightenment, ideals, among, other, things, it, presents, a, taxonomy, of, human, knowledge, see, fig, 3, which, was, inspired, by, francis, bacon, s, the, advancement, of, learning, the, three, main, branches, of, knowledge, are, memory, history, reason, philosophy, and, imagination, poetry, this, tree, of, knowledge, was, created, to, help, readers, evaluate, the, usefulness, of, the, content, within, the, encyclop, die, and, to, organize, its, content, notable, is, the, fact, that, theology, is, ordered, under, philosophy, and, that, knowledge, of, god, is, only, a, few, nodes, away, from, divination, and, black, magic, the, authors, of, the, encyclop, die, challenged, religious, authority, the, authors, especially, diderot, and, d, alembert, located, religion, within, a, system, of, reason, and, philosophy, they, did, not, reject, all, religious, claims, but, believed, theology, and, notions, of, god, must, be, proven, louis, de, jaucourt, therefore, harshly, criticized, superstition, as, an, intellectual, error, in, his, article, on, the, topic, the, writers, further, doubted, the, authenticity, of, presupposed, historical, events, cited, in, the, bible, and, questioned, the, validity, of, miracles, such, as, the, resurrection, however, some, contemporary, scholars, argue, the, skeptical, view, of, miracles, in, the, encyclop, die, may, be, interpreted, in, terms, of, protestant, debates, about, the, cessation, of, the, charismata, these, challenges, led, to, suppression, from, church, and, state, authorities, the, encyclop, die, and, its, contributors, endured, many, attacks, and, attempts, at, censorship, by, the, clergy, or, other, censors, which, threatened, the, publication, of, the, project, as, well, as, the, authors, themselves, the, king, s, council, suppressed, the, encyclop, die, in, 1759, the, catholic, church, under, pope, clement, xiii, placed, it, on, its, list, of, banned, books, prominent, intellectuals, criticized, it, most, famously, lefranc, de, pompignan, at, the, french, academy, a, playwright, charles, palissot, de, montenoy, wrote, a, play, called, les, philosophes, to, criticize, the, encyclop, die, when, abb, andr, morellet, one, of, the, contributors, to, the, encyclop, die, wrote, a, mock, preface, for, it, he, was, sent, to, the, bastille, due, to, allegations, of, libel, to, defend, themselves, from, controversy, the, encyclopedia, s, articles, wrote, of, theological, topics, in, a, mixed, manner, some, articles, supported, orthodoxy, and, some, included, overt, criticisms, of, christianity, to, avoid, direct, retribution, from, censors, writers, often, hid, criticism, in, obscure, articles, or, expressed, it, in, ironic, terms, nonetheless, the, contributors, still, openly, attacked, the, catholic, church, in, certain, articles, with, examples, including, criticizing, excess, festivals, monasteries, and, celibacy, of, the, clergy, the, encyclop, die, is, often, seen, as, an, influence, for, the, french, revolution, because, of, its, emphasis, on, enlightenment, political, theories, diderot, and, other, authors, in, famous, articles, such, as, political, authority, emphasized, the, shift, of, the, origin, of, political, authority, from, divinity, or, heritage, to, the, people, this, enlightenment, ideal, espoused, by, rousseau, and, others, advocated, that, people, have, the, right, to, consent, to, their, government, in, a, form, of, social, contract, another, major, contentious, component, of, political, issues, in, the, encyclop, die, was, personal, or, natural, rights, articles, such, as, natural, rights, by, diderot, explained, the, relationship, between, individuals, and, the, general, will, the, natural, state, of, humanity, according, to, the, authors, is, barbaric, and, unorganized, to, balance, the, desires, of, individuals, and, the, needs, of, the, general, will, humanity, requires, civil, society, and, laws, that, benefit, all, persons, writers, to, varying, degrees, criticized, thomas, hobbes, notions, of, a, selfish, humanity, that, requires, a, sovereign, to, rule, over, it, in, terms, of, economics, the, encyclop, die, expressed, favor, for, laissez, faire, ideals, or, principles, of, economic, liberalism, articles, concerning, economics, or, markets, such, as, economic, politics, generally, favored, free, competition, and, denounced, monopolies, articles, often, criticized, guilds, as, creating, monopolies, and, approved, of, state, intervention, to, remove, such, monopolies, the, writers, advocated, extending, laissez, faire, principles, of, liberalism, from, the, market, to, the, individual, level, such, as, with, privatization, of, education, and, opening, of, careers, to, all, levels, of, wealth, at, the, same, time, the, encyclop, die, was, a, vast, compendium, of, knowledge, notably, on, the, technologies, of, the, period, describing, the, traditional, craft, tools, and, processes, much, information, was, taken, from, the, descriptions, des, arts, et, m, tiers, these, articles, applied, a, scientific, approach, to, understanding, the, mechanical, and, production, processes, and, offered, new, ways, to, improve, machines, to, make, them, more, efficient, diderot, felt, that, people, should, have, access, to, useful, knowledge, that, they, can, apply, to, their, everyday, life, the, encyclop, die, played, an, important, role, in, the, intellectual, foment, leading, to, the, french, revolution, no, encyclopaedia, perhaps, has, been, of, such, political, importance, or, has, occupied, so, conspicuous, a, place, in, the, civil, and, literary, history, of, its, century, it, sought, not, only, to, give, information, but, to, guide, opinion, wrote, the, 1911, encyclop, dia, britannica, in, the, encyclop, die, and, the, age, of,

encyclopedians, successfully, argued, and, marketed, their, belief, in, the, potential, of, reason, and, unified, knowledge, to, empower, human, will, and, thus, helped, to, shape, the, social, issues, that, the, french, revolution, would, address, although, it, is, doubtful, whether, the, many, artisans, technicians, or, laborers, whose, work, and, presence, are, interspersed, throughout, the, encyclop, die, actually, read, it, the, recognition, of, their, work, as, equal, to, that, of, intellectuals, clerics, and, rulers, prepared, the, terrain, for, demands, for, increased, representation, thus, the, encyclop, die, served, to, recognize, and, galvanize, a, new, power, base, ultimately, contributing, to, the, destruction, of, old, values, and, the, creation, of, new, ones, 12, while, many, contributors, to, the, encyclop, die, had, no, interest, in, radically, reforming, french, society, the, encyclop, die, as, a, whole, pointed, that, way, the, encyclop, die, denied, that, the, teachings, of, the, catholic, church, could, be, treated, as, authoritative, in, matters, of, science, the, editors, also, refused, to, treat, the, decisions, of, political, powers, as, definitive, in, intellectual, or, artistic, questions, some, articles, talked, about, changing, social, and, political, institutions, that, would, improve, their, society, for, everyone, given, that, paris, was, the, intellectual, capital, of, europe, at, the, time, and, that, many, european, leaders, used, french, as, their, administrative, language, these, ideas, had, the, capacity, to, spread, the, encyclop, die, s, influence, continues, today, historian, dan, o, sullivan, compares, it, to, wikipedia, like, wikipedia, the, encyclop, die, was, a, collaborative, effort, involving, numerous, writers, and, technicians, as, do, wikipedians, today, diderot, and, his, colleagues, needed, to, engage, with, the, latest, technology, in, dealing, with, the, problems, of, designing, an, up, to, date, encyclopedia, these, included, what, kind, of, information, to, include, how, to, set, up, links, between, various, articles, and, how, to, achieve, the, maximum, readership,
