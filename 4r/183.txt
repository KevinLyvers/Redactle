have, written, still, intending, to, complete, this, missing, chapter, when, pushkin, finally, decided, to, abandon, this, chapter, he, removed, parts, of, the, ending, to, fit, with, the, change, chapter, 8, was, begun, before, december, 24, 1829, while, pushkin, was, in, st, petersburg, in, august, 1830, he, went, to, boldino, the, pushkin, family, estate, where, due, to, an, epidemic, of, cholera, he, was, forced, to, stay, for, three, months, during, this, time, he, produced, what, nabokov, describes, as, an, incredible, number, of, masterpieces, and, finished, copying, out, chapter, 8, on, september, 25, 1830, during, the, summer, of, 1831, pushkin, revised, and, completed, chapter, 8, apart, from, onegin, s, letter, which, was, completed, on, october, 5, 1831, the, first, separate, edition, of, chapter, 8, appeared, on, january, 10, 1832, pushkin, wrote, at, least, 18, stanzas, of, a, never, completed, tenth, chapter, it, contained, many, satires, and, even, direct, criticism, on, contemporary, russian, rulers, including, the, emperor, himself, afraid, of, being, prosecuted, for, dissidence, pushkin, burnt, most, of, the, tenth, chapter, very, little, of, it, survived, in, pushkin, s, notebooks, the, first, complete, edition, of, the, book, was, published, in, 1833, slight, corrections, were, made, by, pushkin, for, the, 1837, edition, the, standard, accepted, text, is, based, on, the, 1837, edition, with, a, few, changes, due, to, the, tsar, s, censorship, restored, in, pushkin, s, time, the, early, 19th, century, duels, were, very, strictly, regulated, a, second, s, primary, duty, was, to, prevent, the, duel, from, actually, happening, and, only, when, both, combatants, were, unwilling, to, stand, down, were, they, to, make, sure, that, the, duel, proceeded, according, to, formalised, rules, a, challenger, s, second, should, therefore, always, ask, the, challenged, party, if, he, wants, to, apologise, for, the, actions, that, have, led, to, the, challenge, in, eugene, onegin, lensky, s, second, zaretsky, does, not, ask, onegin, even, once, if, he, would, like, to, apologise, and, because, onegin, is, not, allowed, to, apologise, on, his, own, initiative, the, duel, takes, place, with, fatal, consequences, zaretsky, is, described, as, classical, and, pedantic, in, duels, chapter, 6, stanza, xxvi, and, this, seems, very, out, of, character, for, a, nobleman, in, effect, he, is, enthusiastic, at, the, prospect, of, a, duel, and, callous, about, its, deadly, possibilities, zaretsky, s, first, chance, to, end, the, duel, is, when, he, delivers, lensky, s, written, challenge, to, onegin, chapter, 6, stanza, ix, instead, of, asking, onegin, if, he, would, like, to, apologise, he, apologises, for, having, much, to, do, at, home, and, leaves, as, soon, as, onegin, obligatorily, accepts, the, challenge, on, the, day, of, the, duel, zaretsky, gets, several, more, chances, to, prevent, the, duel, from, happening, because, dueling, was, forbidden, in, the, russian, empire, duels, were, always, held, at, dawn, zaretsky, urges, lensky, to, get, ready, shortly, after, 6, o, clock, in, the, morning, chapter, 6, stanza, xxiii, while, the, sun, only, rises, at, 20, past, 8, because, he, expects, onegin, to, be, on, time, however, onegin, oversleeps, chapter, 6, stanza, xxiv, and, arrives, on, the, scene, more, than, an, hour, late, according, to, the, dueling, codex, if, a, duelist, arrives, more, than, 15, minutes, late, he, automatically, forfeits, the, duel, lensky, and, zaretsky, have, been, waiting, all, that, time, chapter, 6, stanza, xxvi, even, though, it, was, zaretsky, s, duty, to, proclaim, lensky, as, winner, and, take, him, home, when, onegin, finally, arrives, zaretsky, is, supposed, to, ask, him, a, final, time, if, he, would, like, to, apologise, instead, zaretsky, is, surprised, by, the, apparent, absence, of, onegin, s, second, onegin, against, all, rules, appoints, his, servant, guillot, as, his, second, chapter, 6, stanza, xxvii, a, blatant, insult, for, the, nobleman, zaretsky, zaretsky, angrily, accepts, guillot, as, onegin, s, second, by, his, actions, zaretsky, does, not, act, as, a, nobleman, should, in, the, end, onegin, wins, the, duel, onegin, himself, however, tried, as, he, could, to, prevent, the, fatal, outcome, and, killed, lensky, unwillingly, and, almost, by, accident, as, the, first, shooter, he, couldn, t, show, that, he, was, deliberately, trying, to, miss, the, opponent, because, this, was, considered, as, a, serious, insult, and, could, create, a, formal, reason, to, appoint, another, duel, instead, he, tried, to, minimize, his, chances, of, hitting, lensky, by, shooting, without, precise, aiming, from, the, maximal, possible, distance, not, even, trying, to, come, closer, and, get, a, clear, shot, translators, of, eugene, onegin, have, all, had, to, adopt, a, trade, off, between, precision, and, preservation, of, poetic, imperatives, this, particular, challenge, and, the, importance, of, eugene, onegin, in, russian, literature, have, resulted, in, an, impressive, number, of, competing, translations, walter, w, arndt, s, 1963, translation, isbn, 0, 87501, 106, 3, was, written, keeping, to, the, strict, rhyme, scheme, of, the, onegin, stanza, and, won, the, bollingen, prize, for, translation, it, is, still, considered, one, of, the, best, translations, vladimir, nabokov, severely, criticised, arndt, s, translation, as, he, had, criticised, many, previous, and, later, translations, nabokov, s, main, criticism, of, arndt, s, and, other, translations, is, that, they, sacrificed, literalness, and, exactness, for, the, sake, of, preserving, the, melody, and, rhyme, accordingly, in, 1964, he, published, his, own, translation, consisting, of, four, volumes, which, conformed, scrupulously, to, the, sense, while, completely, eschewing, melody, and, rhyme, the, first, volume, contains, an, introduction, by, nabokov, and, the, text, of, the, translation, the, introduction, discusses, the, structure, of, the, novel, the, onegin, stanza, in, which, it, is, written, and, pushkin, s, opinion, of, onegin, using, pushkin, s, letters, to, his, friends, it, likewise, gives, a, detailed, account, of, both, the, time, over, which, pushkin, wrote, onegin, and, of, the, various, forms, in, which, the, various, parts, of, it, appeared, in, publication, before, pushkin, s, death, after, which, there, is, a, huge, proliferation, of, the, number, of, different, editions, the, second, and, third, volumes, consist, of, very, detailed, and, rigorous, notes, to, the, text, the, fourth, volume, contains, a, facsimile, of, the, 1837, edition, the, discussion, of, the, onegin, stanza, in, the, first, volume, contains, the, poem, on, translating, eugene, onegin, which, first, appeared, in, print, in, the, new, yorker, on, january, 8, 1955, and, is, written, in, two, onegin, stanzas, nabokov, reproduces, the, poem, both, so, that, the, reader, of, his, translation, would, have, some, experience, of, this, unique, form, and, also, to, act, as, a, further, defence, of, his, decision, to, write, his, translation, in, prose, nabokov, s, previously, close, friend, edmund, wilson, reviewed, nabokov, s, translation, in, the, new, york, review, of, books, which, sparked, an, exchange, of, letters, and, an, enduring, falling, out, between, them, john, bayley, has, described, nabokov, s, commentary, as, by, far, the, most, erudite, as, well, as, the, most, fascinating, commentary, in, english, on, pushkin, s, poem, and, as, scrupulously, accurate, in, terms, of, grammar, sense, and, phrasing, as, it, is, idiosyncratic, and, nabokovian, in, its, vocabulary, it, is, generally, agreed, that, nabokov, s, translation, is, extremely, accurate, henry, spalding, published, a, translation, in, 1881, ivan, turgenev, called, his, translation, astonishingly, faithful, and, the, text, remained, the, only, complete, translation, for, fifty, years, even, later, the, russian, critic, ernest, simmons, praised, spalding, for, his, translation, and, scholarly, notes, on, pushkin, s, novel, in, verse, babette, deutsch, published, a, translation, in, 1935, that, preserved, the, onegin, stanzas, the, pushkin, press, published, a, translation, in, 1937, reprinted, 1943,

is, generally, considered, to, surpass, arndt, s, johnston, s, translation, is, influenced, by, nabokov, vikram, seth, s, novel, the, golden, gate, was, in, turn, inspired, by, this, translation, james, e, falen, the, professor, of, russian, at, the, university, of, tennessee, published, a, translation, in, 1995, which, was, also, influenced, by, nabokov, s, translation, but, preserved, the, onegin, stanzas, isbn, 0809316307, this, translation, is, considered, to, be, the, most, faithful, to, pushkin, s, spirit, according, to, russian, critics, and, translators, douglas, hofstadter, published, a, translation, in, 1999, again, preserving, the, onegin, stanzas, after, having, summarised, the, controversy, and, severely, criticised, nabokov, s, attitude, towards, verse, translation, in, his, book, le, ton, beau, de, marot, hofstadter, s, translation, employs, a, unique, lexicon, of, both, high, and, low, register, words, as, well, as, unexpected, and, almost, reaching, rhymes,
