commencement, address, said, well, you, are, about, to, start, the, greatest, improvisation, of, all, with, no, script, no, idea, what, s, going, to, happen, often, with, people, and, places, you, have, never, seen, before, and, you, are, not, in, control, so, say, yes, and, if, you, re, lucky, you, ll, find, people, who, will, say, yes, back, tina, fey, in, her, book, bossypants, lists,

a, variety, of, acceptance, based, psychotherapies, improv, training, has, been, recommended, for, couples, therapy, and, therapist, training, and, it, has, been, speculated, that, improv, training, may, be, helpful, in, some, cases, of, social, anxiety, disorder, improvisational, theatre, often, allows, an, interactive, relationship, with, the, audience, improv, groups, frequently, solicit, suggestions, from, the, audience, as, a, source, of, inspiration, a, way, of, getting, the, audience, involved, and, as, a, means, of, proving, that, the, performance, is, not, scripted, that, charge, is, sometimes, aimed, at, the, masters, of, the, art, whose, performances, can, seem, so, detailed, that, viewers, may, suspect, the, scenes, are, planned, in, order, for, an, improvised, scene, to, be, successful, the, improvisers, involved, must, work, together, responsively, to, define, the, parameters, and, action, of, the, scene, in, a, process, of, co, creation, with, each, spoken, word, or, action, in, the, scene, an, improviser, makes, an, offer, meaning, that, he, or, she, defines, some, element, of, the, reality, of, the, scene, this, might, include, giving, another, character, a, name, identifying, a, relationship, location, or, using, mime, to, define, the, physical, environment, these, activities, are, also, known, as, endowment, it, is, the, responsibility, of, the, other, improvisers, to, accept, the, offers, that, their, fellow, performers, make, to, not, do, so, is, known, as, blocking, negation, or, denial, which, usually, prevents, the, scene, from, developing, some, performers, may, deliberately, block, or, otherwise, break, out, of, character, for, comedic, effect, this, is, known, as, gagging, but, this, generally, prevents, the, scene, from, advancing, and, is, frowned, upon, by, many, improvisers, accepting, an, offer, is, usually, accompanied, by, adding, a, new, offer, often, building, on, the, earlier, one, this, is, a, process, improvisers, refer, to, as, yes, and, and, is, considered, the, cornerstone, of, improvisational, technique, every, new, piece, of, information, added, helps, the, improvisers, to, refine, their, characters, and, progress, the, action, of, the, scene, the, yes, and, rule, however, applies, to, a, scene, s, early, stage, since, it, is, in, this, stage, that, a, base, or, shared, reality, is, established, in, order, to, be, later, redefined, by, applying, the, if, this, is, true, then, what, else, can, also, be, true, practice, progressing, the, scene, into, comedy, as, explained, in, the, 2013, manual, by, the, upright, citizens, brigade, members, the, unscripted, nature, of, improv, also, implies, no, predetermined, knowledge, about, the, props, that, might, be, useful, in, a, scene, improv, companies, may, have, at, their, disposal, some, number, of, readily, accessible, props, that, can, be, called, upon, at, a, moment, s, notice, but, many, improvisers, eschew, props, in, favor, of, the, infinite, possibilities, available, through, mime, in, improv, this, is, more, commonly, known, as, space, object, work, or, space, work, rather, than, mime, and, the, props, and, locations, created, by, this, technique, as, space, objects, created, out, of, space, substance, developed, as, a, technique, by, viola, spolin, as, with, all, improv, offers, improvisers, are, encouraged, to, respect, the, validity, and, continuity, of, the, imaginary, environment, defined, by, themselves, and, their, fellow, performers, this, means, for, example, taking, care, not, to, walk, through, the, table, or, miraculously, survive, multiple, bullet, wounds, from, another, improviser, s, gun, because, improvisers, may, be, required, to, play, a, variety, of, roles, without, preparation, they, need, to, be, able, to, construct, characters, quickly, with, physicality, gestures, accents, voice, changes, or, other, techniques, as, demanded, by, the, situation, the, improviser, may, be, called, upon, to, play, a, character, of, a, different, age, or, sex, character, motivations, are, an, important, part, of, successful, improv, scenes, and, improvisers, must, therefore, attempt, to, act, according, to, the, objectives, that, they, believe, their, character, seeks, in, improv, formats, with, multiple, scenes, an, agreed, upon, signal, is, used, to, denote, scene, changes, most, often, this, takes, the, form, of, a, performer, running, in, front, of, the, scene, known, as, a, wipe, tapping, a, character, in, or, out, can, also, be, employed, the, performers, not, currently, part, of, the, scene, often, stand, at, the, side, or, back, of, the, stage, and, can, enter, or, exit, the, scene, by, stepping, into, or, out, of, the, stage, center, many, theatre, troupes, are, devoted, to, staging, improvisational, performances, and, growing, the, improv, community, through, their, training, centers, in, addition, to, for, profit, theatre, troupes, there, are, many, college, based,

possibilities, offered, by, the, use, of, the, abstract, in, improvised, performance, including, dance, movement, sound, music, mask, work, lighting, and, so, on, these, groups, are, not, especially, interested, in, comedy, either, as, a, technique, or, as, an, effect, but, rather, in, expanding, the, improv, genre, so, as, to, incorporate, techniques, and, approaches, that, have, long, been, a,
