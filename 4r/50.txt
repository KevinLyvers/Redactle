the, pantheon, uk, p, n, i, n, us, n, latin, pantheum, from, greek, pantheion, of, all, the, gods, is, a, former, roman, temple, and, since, ad, 609, a, catholic, church, basilica, santa, maria, ad, martyres, or, basilica, of, st, mary, and, the, martyrs, in, rome, italy, it, was, built, on, the, site, of, an, earlier, temple, commissioned, by, marcus, vipsanius, agrippa, during, the, reign, of, augustus, 27, bc, ad, 14, then, after, the, original, burnt, down, the, present, building, was, ordered, by, the, emperor, hadrian, and, probably, dedicated, c, ad, 126, its, date, of, construction, is, uncertain, because, hadrian, chose, not, to, inscribe, the, new, temple, but, rather, to, retain, the, inscription, of, agrippa, s, older, temple, the, building, is, round, in, plan, except, for, the, portico, with, large, granite, corinthian, columns, eight, in, the, first, rank, and, two, groups, of, four, behind, under, a, pediment, a, rectangular, vestibule, links, the, porch, to, the, rotunda, which, is, under, a, coffered, concrete, dome, with, a, central, opening, oculus, to, the, sky, almost, two, thousand, years, after, it, was, built, the, pantheon, s, dome, is, still, the, world, s, largest, unreinforced, concrete, dome, the, height, to, the, oculus, and, the, diameter, of, the, interior, circle, are, the, same, 43, metres, 142, ft, it, is, one, of, the, best, preserved, of, all, ancient, roman, buildings, in, large, part, because, it, has, been, in, continuous, use, throughout, its, history, since, the, 7th, century, it, has, been, a, church, dedicated, to, st, mary, and, the, martyrs, latin, sancta, maria, ad, martyres, known, as, santa, maria, rotonda, the, square, in, front, of, the, pantheon, is, called, piazza, della, rotonda, the, pantheon, is, a, state, property, managed, by, italy, s, ministry, of, cultural, heritage, and, activities, and, tourism, through, the, polo, museale, del, lazio, in, 2013, it, was, visited, by, over, six, million, people, the, pantheon, s, large, circular, domed, cella, with, a, conventional, temple, portico, front, was, unique, in, roman, architecture, nevertheless, it, became, a, standard, exemplar, when, classical, styles, were, revived, and, has, been, copied, many, times, by, later, architects, the, name, pantheon, is, from, the, ancient, greek, pantheion, meaning, of, relating, to, or, common, to, all, the, gods, pan, meaning, all, theion, meaning, of, or, sacred, to, a, god, the, simplest, explanation, for, the, name, is, that, the, pantheon, was, a, temple, dedicated, to, all, the, gods, however, the, concept, of, a, temple, dedicated, to, all, the, gods, has, been, questioned, ziegler, tried, to, collect, evidence, of, pantheons, but, his, list, consists, of, simple, dedications, to, all, the, gods, or, to, the, twelve, gods, which, are, not, necessarily, true, pantheons, in, the, sense, of, a, temple, housing, a, cult, that, literally, worships, all, the, gods, the, only, definite, pantheon, recorded, earlier, than, agrippa, s, was, at, antioch, in, syria, though, it, is, only, mentioned, by, a, sixth, century, source, cassius, dio, a, roman, senator, who, wrote, in, greek, speculated, that, the, name, of, the, pantheon, comes, either, from, the, statues, of, many, gods, placed, around, this, building, or, from, the, resemblance, of, the, dome, to, the, heavens, according, to, adam, ziolkowski, this, uncertainty, strongly, suggests, that, pantheon, or, pantheum, was, merely, a, nickname, not, the, formal, name, of, the, building, godfrey, and, hemsoll, point, out, that, ancient, authors, never, refer, to, hadrian, s, pantheon, with, the, word, aedes, as, they, do, with, other, temples, and, the, severan, inscription, carved, on, the, architrave, uses, simply, pantheum, not, aedes, panthei, temple, of, all, the, gods, livy, wrote, that, it, had, been, decreed, that, temple, buildings, or, perhaps, temple, cellae, should, only, be, dedicated, to, single, divinities, so, that, it, would, be, clear, who, would, be, offended, if, for, example, the, building, was, struck, by, lightning, and, because, it, was, only, appropriate, to, offer, sacrifice, to, a, specific, deity, 27, 25, 7, 10, godfrey, and, hemsoll, maintain, that, the, word, pantheon, need, not, denote, a, particular, group, of, gods, or, indeed, even, all, the, gods, since, it, could, well, have, had, other, meanings, certainly, the, word, pantheus, or, pantheos, could, be, applicable, to, individual, deities, bearing, in, mind, also, that, the, greek, word, theios, need, not, mean, of, a, god, but, could, mean, superhuman, or, even, excellent, since, the, french, revolution, when, the, church, of, sainte, genevi, ve, in, paris, was, deconsecrated, and, turned, into, the, secular, monument, called, the, panth, on, of, paris, the, generic, term, pantheon, has, sometimes, been, applied, to, other, buildings, in, which, illustrious, dead, are, honoured, or, buried, in, the, aftermath, of, the, battle, of, actium, 31, bc, marcus, vipsanius, agrippa, started, an, impressive, building, program, the, pantheon, was, a, part, of, the, complex, created, by, him, on, his, own, property, in, the, campus, martius, in, 29, 19, bc, which, included, three, buildings, aligned, from, south, to, north, the, baths, of, agrippa, the, basilica, of, neptune, and, the, pantheon, it, seems, likely, that, the, pantheon, and, the, basilica, of, neptune, were, agrippa, s, sacra, privata, not, aedes, publicae, public, temples, the, former, would, help, explain, how, the, building, could, have, so, easily, lost, its, original, name, and, purpose, ziolkowski, contends, that, it, was, originally, the, temple, of, mars, in, campo, in, such, a, relatively, short, period, of, time, it, had, long, been, thought, that, the, current, building, was, built, by, agrippa, with, later, alterations, undertaken, and, this, was, in, part, because, of, the, latin, inscription, on, the, front, of, the, temple, which, reads, or, in, full, m, agrippa, l, f, co, s, tertium, fecit, meaning, marcus, agrippa, son, of, lucius, made, when, consul, for, the, third, time, however, archaeological, excavations, have, shown, that, the, pantheon, of, agrippa, had, been, completely, destroyed, except, for, the, fa, ade, lise, hetland, argues, that, the, present, construction, began, in, 114, under, trajan, four, years, after, it, was, destroyed, by, fire, for, the, second, time, oros, 7, 12, she, reexamined, herbert, bloch, s, 1959, paper, which, is, responsible, for, the, commonly, maintained, hadrianic, date, and, maintains, that, he, should, not, have, excluded, all, of, the, trajanic, era, bricks, from, his, brick, stamp, study, her, argument, is, particularly, interesting, in, light, of, heilmeyer, s, argument, that, based, on, stylistic, evidence, apollodorus, of, damascus, trajan, s, architect, was, the, obvious, architect, the, form, of, agrippa, s, pantheon, is, debated, as, a, result, of, excavations, in, the, late, 19th, century, archaeologist, rodolfo, lanciani, concluded, that, agrippa, s, pantheon, was, oriented, so, that, it, faced, south, in, contrast, with, the, current, layout, that, faces, north, and, that, it, had, a, shortened, t, shaped, plan, with, the, entrance, at, the, base, of, the, t, this, description, was, widely, accepted, until, the, late, 20th, century, while, more, recent, archaeological, diggings, have, suggested, that, agrippa, s, building, might, have, had, a, circular, form, with, a, triangular, porch, and, it, might, have, also, faced, north, much, like, the, later, rebuildings, ziolkowski, complains, that, their, conclusions, were, based, entirely, on, surmise, according, to, him, they, did, not, find, any, new, datable, material, yet, they, attributed, everything, they, found, to, the, agrippan, phase, failing, to, account, for, the, fact, that, domitian, known, for, his, enthusiasm, for, building, and, known, to, have, restored, the, pantheon, after, 80, ad, might, well, have, been, responsible, for, everything, they, found, ziolkowski, argues, that, lanciani, s, initial, assessment, is, still, supported, by, all, of, the, finds, to, date, including, theirs, he, expresses, scepticism, because, the, building, they, describe, a, single, building, composed, of, a, huge, pronaos, and, a, circular, cella, of, the, same, diameter, linked, by, a, relatively, narrow, and, very, short, passage, much, thinner, than, the, current, intermediate, block, has, no, known, parallels, in, classical, architecture, and, would, go, against, everything, we, know, of, roman, design, principles, in, general, and, of, augustan, architecture, in, particular, the, only, passages, referring, to, the, decoration, of, the, agrippan, pantheon, written, by, an, eyewitness, are, in, pliny, the, elder, s, natural, history, from, him, we, know, that, the, capitals, too, of, the, pillars, which, were, placed, by, m, agrippa, in, the, pantheon, are, made, of, syracusan, bronze, that, the, pantheon, of, agrippa, has, been, decorated, by, diogenes, of, athens, and, the, caryatides, by, him, which, form, the, columns, of, that, temple, are, looked, upon, as, masterpieces, of, excellence, the, same, too, with, the, statues, that, are, placed, upon, the, roof, and, that, one, of, cleopatra, s, pearls, was, cut, in, half, so, that, each, half, might, serve, as, pendants, for, the, ears, of, venus, in, the, pantheon, at, rome, the, augustan, pantheon, was, destroyed, along, with, other, buildings, in, a, fire, in, 80, ad, domitian, rebuilt, the, pantheon, which, was, burnt, again, in, 110, ad, the, degree, to, which, the, decorative, scheme, should, be, credited, to, hadrian, s, architects, is, uncertain, finished, by, hadrian, but, not, claimed, as, one, of, his, works, it, used, the, text, of, the, original, inscription, on, the, new, fa, ade, a, common, practice, in, hadrian, s, rebuilding, projects, all, over, rome, the, only, building, on, which, hadrian, put, his, own, name, was, the, temple, to, the, deified, trajan, how, the, building, was, actually, used, is, not, known, the, historia, augusta, says, that, hadrian, dedicated, the, pantheon, among, other, buildings, in, the, name, of, the, original, builder, hadr, 19, 10, but, the, current, inscription, could, not, be, a, copy, of, the, original, it, does, not, tell, us, to, whom, agrippa, s, foundation, was, dedicated, and, in, ziolkowski, s, opinion, it, was, highly, unlikely, that, in, 25, bc, agrippa, would, have, presented, himself, as, consul, tertium, on, coins, the, same, words, m, agrippa, l, f, cos, tertium, were, the, ones, used, to, refer, to, him, after, his, death, consul, tertium, serving, as, a, sort, of, posthumous, cognomen, ex, virtute, a, remembrance, of, the, fact, that, of, all, the, men, of, his, generation, apart, from, augustus, himself, he, was, the, only, one, to, hold, the, consulship, thrice, whatever, the, cause, of, the, alteration, of, the, inscription, might, have, been, the, new, inscription, reflects, the, fact, that, there, was, a, change, in, the, building, s, purpose, cassius, dio, a, graeco, roman, senator, consul, and, author, of, a, comprehensive, history, of, rome, writing, approximately, 75, years, after, the, pantheon, s, reconstruction, mistakenly, attributed, the, domed, building, to, agrippa, rather, than, hadrian, dio, appears, to, be, the, only, near, contemporaneous, writer, to, mention, the, pantheon, even, by, 200, there, was, uncertainty, about, the, origin, of, the, building, and, its, purpose, agrippa, finished, the, construction, of, the, building, called, the, pantheon, it, has, this, name, perhaps, because, it, received, among, the, images, which, decorated, it, the, statues, of, many, gods, including, mars, and, venus, but, my, own, opinion, of, the, name, is, that, because, of, its, vaulted, roof, it, resembles, the, heavens, in, 202, the, building, was, repaired, by, the, joint, emperors, septimius, severus, and, his, son, caracalla, fully, marcus, aurelius, antoninus, for, which, there, is, another, smaller, inscription, on, the, architrave, of, the, fa, ade, under, the, aforementioned, larger, text, this, now, barely, legible, inscription, reads, in, english, this, means, in, 609, the, byzantine, emperor, phocas, gave, the, building, to, pope, boniface, iv, who, converted, it, into, a, christian, church, and, consecrated, it, to, st, mary, and, the, martyrs, on, 13, may, 609, another, pope, boniface, asked, the, same, to, order, that, in, the, old, temple, called, the, pantheon, after, the, pagan, filth, was, removed, a, church, should, be, made, to, the, holy, virgin, mary, and, all, the, martyrs, so, that, the, commemoration, of, the, saints, would, take, place, henceforth, where, not, gods, but, demons, were, formerly, worshipped, twenty, eight, cartloads, of, holy, relics, of, martyrs, were, said, to, have, been, removed, from, the, catacombs, and, placed, in, a, porphyry, basin, beneath, the, high, altar, on, its, consecration, boniface, placed, an, icon, of, the, mother, of, god, as, panagia, hodegetria, all, holy, directress, within, the, new, sanctuary, the, building, s, consecration, as, a, church, saved, it, from, the, abandonment, destruction, and, the, worst, of, the, spoliation, that, befell, the, majority, of, ancient, rome, s, buildings, during, the, early, middle, ages, however, paul, the, deacon, records, the, spoliation, of, the, building, by, the, emperor, constans, ii, who, visited, rome, in, july, 663, remaining, at, rome, twelve, days, he, pulled, down, everything, that, in, ancient, times, had, been, made, of, metal, for, the, ornament, of, the, city, to, such, an, extent, that, he, even, stripped, off, the, roof, of, the, church, which, at, one, time, was, called, the, pantheon, and, had, been, founded, in, honour, of, all, the, gods, and, was, now, by, the, consent, of, the, former, rulers, the, place, of, all, the, martyrs, and, he, took, away, from, there, the, bronze, tiles, and, sent, them, with, all, the, other, ornaments, to, constantinople, much, fine, external, marble, has, been, removed, over, the, centuries, for, example, capitals, from, some, of, the, pilasters, are, in, the, british, museum, two, columns, were, swallowed, up, in, the, medieval, buildings, that, abutted, the, pantheon, on, the, east, and, were, lost, in, the, early, 17th, century, urban, viii, barberini, tore, away, the, bronze, ceiling, of, the, portico, and, replaced, the, medieval, campanile, with, the, famous, twin, towers, often, wrongly, attributed, to, bernini, called, the, ass, s, ears, which, were, not, removed, until, the, late, 19th, century, the, only, other, loss, has, been, the, external, sculptures, which, adorned, the, pediment, above, agrippa, s, inscription, the, marble, interior, has, largely, survived, although, with, extensive, restoration, since, the, renaissance, the, pantheon, has, been, the, site, of, several, important, burials, among, those, buried, there, are, the, painters, raphael, and, annibale, carracci, the, composer, arcangelo, corelli, and, the, architect, baldassare, peruzzi, in, the, 15th, century, the, pantheon, was, adorned, with, paintings, the, best, known, is, the, annunciation, by, melozzo, da, forl, filippo, brunelleschi, among, other, architects, looked, to, the, pantheon, as, inspiration, for, their, works, pope, urban, viii, 1623, to, 1644, ordered, the, bronze, ceiling, of, the, pantheon, s, portico, melted, down, most, of, the, bronze, was, used, to, make, bombards, for, the, fortification, of, castel, sant, angelo, with, the, rest, used, by, the, apostolic, camera, for, other, works, it, is, also, said, that, the, bronze, was, used, by, bernini, in, creating, his, famous, baldachin, above, the, high, altar, of, st, peter, s, basilica, but, according, to, at, least, one, expert, the, pope, s, accounts, state, that, about, 90, of, the, bronze, was, used, for, the, cannon, and, that, the, bronze, for, the, baldachin, came, from, venice, concerning, this, an, anonymous, contemporary, roman, satirist, quipped, in, a, pasquinade, a, publicly, posted, poem, that, quod, non, fecerunt, barbari, fecerunt, barberini, what, the, barbarians, did, not, do, the, barberinis, did, in, 1747, the, broad, frieze, below, the, dome, with, its, false, windows, was, restored, but, bore, little, resemblance, to, the, original, in, the, early, decades, of, the, 20th, century, a, piece, of, the, original, as, far, as, could, be, reconstructed, from, renaissance, drawings, and, paintings, was, recreated, in, one, of, the, panels, two, kings, of, italy, are, buried, in, the, pantheon, vittorio, emanuele, ii, and, umberto, i, as, well, as, umberto, s, queen, margherita, it, was, supposed, to, be, the, final, resting, place, for, the, monarchs, of, italy, of, the, house, of, savoy, but, the, monarchy, was, abolished, in, 1946, and, the, authorities, have, refused, to, grant, burial, to, the, former, kings, who, died, in, exile, victor, emmanuel, iii, and, umberto, ii, the, national, institute, for, the, honour, guard, of, the, royal, tombs, of, the, pantheon, was, originally, chartered, by, the, house, of, savoy, and, subsequently, operating, with, authorization, of, the, italian, republic, mounts, as, guards, of, honour, in, front, of, the, royal, tombs, the, pantheon, is, in, use, as, a, catholic, church, and, as, such, visitors, are, asked, to, keep, an, appropriate, level, of, deference, masses, are, celebrated, there, on, sundays, and, holy, days, of, obligation, weddings, are, also, held, there, from, time, to, time, the, building, was, originally, approached, by, a, flight, of, steps, later, construction, raised, the, level, of, the, ground, leading, to, the, portico, eliminating, these, steps, the, pediment, was, decorated, with, relief, sculpture, probably, of, gilded, bronze, holes, marking, the, location, of, clamps, that, held, the, sculpture, suggest, that, its, design, was, likely, an, eagle, within, a, wreath, ribbons, extended, from, the, wreath, into, the, corners, of, the, pediment, on, the, intermediate, block, between, the, portico, and, the, rotunda, the, remains, of, a, second, pediment, suggests, that, the, existing, portico, is, much, shorter, than, originally, intended, a, portico, aligned, with, the, second, pediment, would, fit, columns, with, shafts, 50, roman, feet, 14, 8, metres, tall, and, capitals, 10, roman, feet, tall, 3, metres, whereas, the, existing, portico, has, shafts, 40, roman, feet, 11, 9, metres, tall, and, capitals, eight, roman, feet, 2, 4, metres, tall, mark, wilson, jones, has, attempted, to, explain, the, design, adjustments, by, suggesting, that, once, the, higher, pediment, had, been, constructed, the, required, 50, foot, columns, failed, to, arrive, possibly, as, a, result, of, logistical, difficulties, the, builders, then, had, to, make, some, awkward, adjustments, to, fit, the, shorter, columns, and, pediments, rabun, taylor, has, noted, that, even, if, the, taller, columns, were, delivered, basic, construction, constraints, may, have, prevented, their, use, assuming, that, each, column, would, first, be, laid, on, the, floor, next, to, its, pediment, before, being, pivoted, upright, using, something, like, an, a, frame, there, would, be, a, space, requirement, of, a, column, length, on, one, side, of, the, pediment, and, at, least, a, column, length, on, the, opposite, side, for, the, pivoting, equipment, and, ropes, with, 50, foot, columns, there, was, no, way, to, sequence, the, erection, of, without, creating, a, hopeless, snarl, the, shafts, were, simply, too, long, to, be, positioned, on, the, floor, in, a, workable, configuration, regardless, of, sequence, specifically, the, innermost, row, of, columns, would, be, blocked, by, the, main, body, of, the, temple, and, in, the, later, stages, of, construction, some, already, erected, columns, would, inevitably, obstruct, the, erection, of, further, columns, it, has, also, been, argued, that, the, scale, of, the, portico, was, related, to, the, urban, design, of, the, space, in, front, of, the, temple, the, grey, granite, columns, that, were, used, in, the, pantheon, s, pronaos, were, quarried, in, egypt, at, mons, claudianus, in, the, eastern, mountains, each, was, 11, 9, metres, 39, ft, tall, 1, 5, metres, 4, ft, 11, in, in, diameter, and, 60, tonnes, 59, long, tons, 66, short, tons, in, weight, these, were, dragged, more, than, 100, km, 62, miles, from, the, quarry, to, the, river, on, wooden, sledges, they, were, floated, by, barge, down, the, nile, when, the, water, level, was, high, during, the, spring, floods, and, then, transferred, to, vessels, to, cross, the, mediterranean, sea, to, the, roman, port, of, ostia, there, they, were, transferred, back, onto, barges, and, pulled, up, the, tiber, river, to, rome, after, being, unloaded, near, the, mausoleum, of, augustus, the, site, of, the, pantheon, was, still, about, 700, metres, away, thus, it, was, necessary, to, either, drag, them, or, to, move, them, on, rollers, to, the, construction, site, in, the, walls, at, the, back, of, the, pantheon, s, portico, are, two, huge, niches, perhaps, intended, for, statues, of, augustus, caesar, and, agrippa, the, large, bronze, doors, to, the, cella, measuring, 4, 45, metres, 14, 6, ft, wide, by, 7, 53, metres, 24, 7, ft, high, are, the, oldest, in, rome, these, were, thought, to, be, a, 15th, century, replacement, for, the, original, mainly, because, they, were, deemed, by, contemporary, architects, to, be, too, small, for, the, door, frames, later, analysis, of, the, fusion, technique, confirmed, that, these, are, the, original, roman, doors, a, rare, example, of, roman, monumental, bronze, surviving, despite, cleaning, and, the, application, of, christian, motifs, over, the, centuries, the, 4, 535, tonne, 4, 463, long, ton, 4, 999, short, ton, weight, of, the, roman, concrete, dome, is, concentrated, on, a, ring, of, voussoirs, 9, 1, metres, 30, ft, in, diameter, that, form, the, oculus, while, the, downward, thrust, of, the, dome, is, carried, by, eight, barrel, vaults, in, the, 6, 4, metre, thick, 21, ft, drum, wall, into, eight, piers, the, thickness, of, the, dome, varies, from, 6, 4, metres, 21, ft, at, the, base, of, the, dome, to, 1, 2, metres, 3, 9, ft, around, the, oculus, the, materials, used, in, the, concrete, of, the, dome, also, vary, at, its, thickest, point, the, aggregate, is, travertine, then, terracotta, tiles, then, at, the, very, top, tufa, and, pumice, both, porous, light, stones, at, the, very, top, where, the, dome, would, be, at, its, weakest, and, vulnerable, to, collapse, the, oculus, lightens, the, load, no, tensile, test, results, are, available, on, the, concrete, used, in, the, pantheon, however, cowan, discussed, tests, on, ancient, concrete, from, roman, ruins, in, libya, which, gave, a, compressive, strength, of, 20, mpa, 2, 900, psi, an, empirical, relationship, gives, a, tensile, strength, of, 1, 47, mpa, 213, psi, for, this, specimen, finite, element, analysis, of, the, structure, by, mark, and, hutchison, found, a, maximum, tensile, stress, of, only, 0, 128, mpa, 18, 5, psi, at, the, point, where, the, dome, joins, the, raised, outer, wall, the, stresses, in, the, dome, were, found, to, be, substantially, reduced, by, the, use, of, successively, less, dense, aggregate, stones, such, as, small, pots, or, pieces, of, pumice, in, higher, layers, of, the, dome, mark, and, hutchison, estimated, that, if, normal, weight, concrete, had, been, used, throughout, the, stresses, in, the, arch, would, have, been, some, 80, greater, hidden, chambers, engineered, within, the, rotunda, form, a, sophisticated, structural, system, this, reduced, the, weight, of, the, roof, as, did, the, oculus, eliminating, the, apex, the, top, of, the, rotunda, wall, features, a, series, of, brick, relieving, arches, visible, on, the, outside, and, built, into, the, mass, of, the, brickwork, the, pantheon, is, full, of, such, devices, for,
