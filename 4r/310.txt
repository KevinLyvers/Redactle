rhythm, from, greek, rhythmos, any, regular, recurring, motion, symmetry, generally, means, a, movement, marked, by, the, regulated, succession, of, strong, and, weak, elements, or, of, opposite, or, different, conditions, this, general, meaning, of, regular, recurrence, or, pattern, in, time, can, apply, to, a, wide, variety, of, cyclical, natural, phenomena, having, a, periodicity, or, frequency, of, anything, from, microseconds, to, several, seconds, as, with, the, riff, in, a, rock, music, song, to, several, minutes, or, hours, or, at, the, most, extreme, even, over, many, years, rhythm, is, related, to, and, distinguished, from, pulse, meter, and, beats, rhythm, may, be, defined, as, the, way, in, which, one, or, more, unaccented, beats, are, grouped, in, relation, to, an, accented, one, a, rhythmic, group, can, be, apprehended, only, when, its, elements, are, distinguished, from, one, another, rhythm, always, involves, an, interrelationship, between, a, single, accented, strong, beat, and, either, one, or, two, unaccented, weak, beats, in, the, performance, arts, rhythm, is, the, timing, of, events, on, a, human, scale, of, musical, sounds, and, silences, that, occur, over, time, of, the, steps, of, a, dance, or, the, meter, of, spoken, language, and, poetry, in, some, performing, arts, such, as, hip, hop, music, the, rhythmic, delivery, of, the, lyrics, is, one, of, the, most, important, elements, of, the, style, rhythm, may, also, refer, to, visual, presentation, as, timed, movement, through, space, and, a, common, language, of, pattern, unites, rhythm, with, geometry, for, example, architects, often, speak, of, the, rhythm, of, a, building, referring, to, patterns, in, the, spacing, of, windows, columns, and, other, elements, of, the, fa, ade, in, recent, years, rhythm, and, meter, have, become, an, important, area, of, research, among, music, scholars, recent, work, in, these, areas, includes, books, by, maury, yeston, fred, lerdahl, and, ray, jackendoff, jonathan, kramer, christopher, hasty, godfried, toussaint, william, rothstein, joel, lester, and, guerino, mazzola, in, his, television, series, how, music, works, howard, goodall, presents, theories, that, human, rhythm, recalls, the, regularity, with, which, we, walk, and, the, heartbeat, other, research, suggests, that, it, does, not, relate, to, the, heartbeat, directly, but, rather, the, speed, of, emotional, affect, which, also, influences, heartbeat, yet, other, researchers, suggest, that, since, certain, features, of, human, music, are, widespread, it, is, reasonable, to, suspect, that, beat, based, rhythmic, processing, has, ancient, evolutionary, roots, justin, london, writes, that, musical, metre, involves, our, initial, perception, as, well, as, subsequent, anticipation, of, a, series, of, beats, that, we, abstract, from, the, rhythm, surface, of, the, music, as, it, unfolds, in, time, the, perception, and, abstraction, of, rhythmic, measure, is, the, foundation, of, human, instinctive, musical, participation, as, when, we, divide, a, series, of, identical, clock, ticks, into, tick, tock, tick, tock, joseph, jordania, recently, suggested, that, the, sense, of, rhythm, was, developed, in, the, early, stages, of, hominid, evolution, by, the, forces, of, natural, selection, plenty, of, animals, walk, rhythmically, and, hear, the, sounds, of, the, heartbeat, in, the, womb, but, only, humans, have, the, ability, to, be, engaged, entrained, in, rhythmically, coordinated, vocalizations, and, other, activities, according, to, jordania, development, of, the, sense, of, rhythm, was, central, for, the, achievement, of, the, specific, neurological, state, of, the, battle, trance, crucial, for, the, development, of, the, effective, defense, system, of, early, hominids, rhythmic, war, cry, rhythmic, drumming, by, shamans, rhythmic, drilling, of, the, soldiers, and, contemporary, professional, combat, forces, listening, to, the, heavy, rhythmic, rock, music, all, use, the, ability, of, rhythm, to, unite, human, individuals, into, a, shared, collective, identity, where, group, members, put, the, interests, of, the, group, above, their, individual, interests, and, safety, some, types, of, parrots, can, know, rhythm, neurologist, oliver, sacks, states, that, chimpanzees, and, other, animals, show, no, similar, appreciation, of, rhythm, yet, posits, that, human, affinity, for, rhythm, is, fundamental, so, that, a, person, s, sense, of, rhythm, cannot, be, lost, e, g, by, stroke, there, is, not, a, single, report, of, an, animal, being, trained, to, tap, peck, or, move, in, synchrony, with, an, auditory, beat, sacks, write, no, doubt, many, pet, lovers, will, dispute, this, notion, and, indeed, many, animals, from, the, lipizzaner, horses, of, the, spanish, riding, school, of, vienna, to, performing, circus, animals, appear, to, dance, to, music, it, is, not, clear, whether, they, are, doing, so, or, are, responding, to, subtle, visual, or, tactile, cues, from, the, humans, around, them, human, rhythmic, arts, are, possibly, to, some, extent, rooted, in, courtship, ritual, the, establishment, of, a, basic, beat, requires, the, perception, of, a, regular, sequence, of, distinct, short, duration, pulses, and, as, a, subjective, perception, of, loudness, is, relative, to, background, noise, levels, a, pulse, must, decay, to, silence, before, the, next, occurs, if, it, is, to, be, really, distinct, for, this, reason, the, fast, transient, sounds, of, percussion, instruments, lend, themselves, to, the, definition, of, rhythm, musical, cultures, that, rely, upon, such, instruments, may, develop, multi, layered, polyrhythm, and, simultaneous, rhythms, in, more, than, one, time, signature, called, polymeter, such, are, the, cross, rhythms, of, sub, saharan, africa, and, the, interlocking, kotekan, rhythms, of, the, gamelan, for, information, on, rhythm, in, indian, music, see, tala, music, for, other, asian, approaches, to, rhythm, see, rhythm, in, persian, music, rhythm, in, arabic, music, and, usul, rhythm, in, turkish, music, and, dumbek, rhythms, as, a, piece, of, music, unfolds, its, rhythmic, structure, is, perceived, not, as, a, series, of, discrete, independent, units, strung, together, in, a, mechanical, additive, way, like, beads, but, as, an, organic, process, in, which, smaller, rhythmic, motives, whole, possessing, a, shape, and, structure, of, their, own, also, function, as, integral, parts, of, a, larger, rhythmic, organization, most, music, dance, and, oral, poetry, establishes, and, maintains, an, underlying, metric, level, a, basic, unit, of, time, that, may, be, audible, or, implied, the, pulse, or, tactus, of, the, mensural, level, or, beat, level, sometimes, simply, called, the, beat, this, consists, of, a, repeating, series, of, identical, yet, distinct, periodic, short, duration, stimuli, perceived, as, points, in, time, the, beat, pulse, is, not, necessarily, the, fastest, or, the, slowest, component, of, the, rhythm, but, the, one, that, is, perceived, as, fundamental, it, has, a, tempo, to, which, listeners, entrain, as, they, tap, their, foot, or, dance, to, a, piece, of, music, it, is, currently, most, often, designated, as, a, crotchet, or, quarter, note, in, western, notation, see, time, signature, faster, levels, are, division, levels, and, slower, levels, are, multiple, levels, maury, yeston, clarified, rhythms, of, recurrence, arise, from, the, interaction, of, two, levels, of, motion, the, faster, providing, the, pulse, and, the, slower, organizing, the, beats, into, repetitive, groups, once, a, metric, hierarchy, has, been, established, we, as, listeners, will, maintain, that, organization, as, long, as, minimal, evidence, is, present, a, durational, pattern, that, synchronises, with, a, pulse, or, pulses, on, the, underlying, metric, level, may, be, called, a, rhythmic, unit, these, may, be, classified, as, a, rhythmic, gesture, is, any, durational, pattern, that, in, contrast, to, the, rhythmic, unit, does, not, occupy, a, period, of, time, equivalent, to, a, pulse, or, pulses, on, an, underlying, metric, level, it, may, be, described, according, to, its, beginning, and, ending, or, by, the, rhythmic, units, it, contains, rhythms, that, begin, on, a, strong, pulse, are, thetic, those, beginning, on, a, weak, pulse, are, anacrustic, and, those, beginning, after, a, rest, or, tied, over, note, are, called, initial, rest, endings, on, a, strong, pulse, are, strong, on, a, weak, pulse, weak, and, those, that, end, on, a, strong, or, weak, upbeat, are, upbeat, rhythm, is, marked, by, the, regulated, succession, of, opposite, elements, the, dynamics, of, the, strong, and, weak, beat, the, played, beat, and, the, inaudible, but, implied, rest, beat, or, the, long, and, short, note, as, well, as, perceiving, rhythm, humans, must, be, able, to, anticipate, it, this, depends, on, repetition, of, a, pattern, that, is, short, enough, to, memorize, the, alternation, of, the, strong, and, weak, beat, is, fundamental, to, the, ancient, language, of, poetry, dance, and, music, the, common, poetic, term, foot, refers, as, in, dance, to, the, lifting, and, tapping, of, the, foot, in, time, in, a, similar, way, musicians, speak, of, an, upbeat, and, a, downbeat, and, of, the, on, and, off, beat, these, contrasts, naturally, facilitate, a, dual, hierarchy, of, rhythm, and, depend, on, repeating, patterns, of, duration, accent, and, rest, forming, a, pulse, group, that, corresponds, to, the, poetic, foot, normally, such, pulse, groups, are, defined, by, taking, the, most, accented, beat, as, the, first, and, counting, the, pulses, until, the, next, accent, scholes, 1977b, a, rhythm, that, accents, another, beat, and, de, emphasises, the, downbeat, as, established, or, assumed, from, the, melody, or, from, a, preceding, rhythm, is, called, syncopated, rhythm, normally, even, the, most, complex, of, meters, may, be, broken, down, into, a, chain, of, duple, and, triple, pulses, either, by, addition, or, division, according, to, pierre, boulez, beat, structures, beyond, four, in, western, music, are, simply, not, natural, the, tempo, of, the, piece, is, the, speed, or, frequency, of, the, tactus, a, measure, of, how, quickly, the, beat, flows, this, is, often, measured, in, beats, per, minute, bpm, 60, bpm, means, a, speed, of, one, beat, per, second, a, frequency, of, 1, hz, a, rhythmic, unit, is, a, durational, pattern, that, has, a, period, equivalent, to, a, pulse, or, several, pulses, the, duration, of, any, such, unit, is, inversely, related, to, its, tempo, musical, sound, may, be, analyzed, on, five, different, time, scales, which, moravscik, has, arranged, in, order, of, increasing, duration, curtis, roads, takes, a, wider, view, by, distinguishing, nine, time, scales, this, time, in, order, of, decreasing, duration, the, first, two, the, infinite, and, the, supra, musical, encompass, natural, periodicities, of, months, years, decades, centuries, and, greater, while, the, last, three, the, sample, and, subsample, which, take, account, of, digital, and, electronic, rates, too, brief, to, be, properly, recorded, or, perceived, measured, in, millionths, of, seconds, microseconds, and, finally, the, infinitesimal, or, infinitely, brief, are, again, in, the, extra, musical, domain, roads, macro, level, encompassing, overall, musical, architecture, or, form, roughly, corresponds, to, moravcsik, s, very, long, division, while, his, meso, level, the, level, of, divisions, of, form, including, movements, sections, phrases, taking, seconds, or, minutes, is, likewise, similar, to, moravcsik, s, long, category, roads, sound, object, a, basic, unit, of, musical, structure, and, a, generalization, of, note, xenakis, mini, structural, time, scale, fraction, of, a, second, to, several, seconds, and, his, microsound, see, granular, synthesis, down, to, the, threshold, of, audible, perception, thousandths, to, millionths, of, seconds, are, similarly, comparable, to, moravcsik, s, short, and, supershort, levels, of, duration, one, difficulty, in, defining, rhythm, is, the, dependence, of, its, perception, on, tempo, and, conversely, the, dependence, of, tempo, perception, on, rhythm, furthermore, the, rhythm, tempo, interaction, is, context, dependent, as, explained, by, andranik, tangian, using, an, example, of, the, leading, rhythm, of, promenade, from, moussorgsky, s, pictures, at, an, exhibition, this, rhythm, is, perceived, as, it, is, rather, than, as, the, first, three, events, repeated, at, a, double, tempo, denoted, as, r012, repeat, from, 0, one, time, twice, faster, however, the, motive, with, this, rhythm, in, the, moussorgsky, s, piece, is, rather, perceived, as, a, repeat, this, context, dependent, perception, of, rhythm, is, explained, by, the, principle, of, correlative, perception, according, to, which, data, are, perceived, in, the, simplest, way, from, the, viewpoint, of, kolmogorov, s, complexity, theory, this, means, such, a, representation, of, the, data, that, minimizes, the, amount, of, memory, the, example, considered, suggests, two, alternative, representations, of, the, same, rhythm, as, it, is, and, as, the, rhythm, tempo, interaction, a, two, level, representation, in, terms, of, a, generative, rhythmic, pattern, and, a, tempo, curve, table, 1, displays, these, possibilities, both, with, and, without, pitch, assuming, that, one, duration, requires, one, byte, of, information, one, byte, is, needed, for, the, pitch, of, one, tone, and, invoking, the, repeat, algorithm, with, its, parameters, r012, takes, four, bytes, as, shown, in, the, bottom, row, of, the, table, the, rhythm, without, pitch, requires, fewer, bytes, if, it, is, perceived, as, it, is, without, repetitions, and, tempo, leaps, on, the, contrary, its, melodic, version, requires, fewer, bytes, if, the, rhythm, is, perceived, as, being, repeated, at, a, double, tempo, thus, the, loop, of, interdependence, of, rhythm, and, tempo, is, overcome, due, to, the, simplicity, criterion, which, optimally, distributes, the, complexity, of, perception, between, rhythm, and, tempo, in, the, above, example, the, repetition, is, recognized, because, of, additional, repetition, of, the, melodic, contour, which, results, in, a, certain, redundancy, of, the, musical, structure, making, the, recognition, of, the, rhythmic, pattern, robust, under, tempo, deviations, generally, speaking, the, more, redundant, the, musical, support, of, a, rhythmic, pattern, the, better, its, recognizability, under, augmentations, and, diminutions, that, is, its, distortions, are, perceived, as, tempo, variations, rather, than, rhythmic, changes, by, taking, into, account, melodic, context, homogeneity, of, accompaniment, harmonic, pulsation, and, other, cues, the, range, of, admissible, tempo, deviations, can, be, extended, further, yet, still, not, preventing, musically, normal, perception, for, example, skrjabin, s, own, performance, of, his, poem, op, 32, no, 1, transcribed, from, a, piano, roll, recording, contains, tempo, deviations, within, 19, 119, a, span, of, 5, 5, times, such, tempo, deviations, are, strictly, prohibited, for, example, in, bulgarian, or, turkish, music, based, on, so, called, additive, rhythms, with, complex, duration, ratios, which, can, also, be, explained, by, the, principle, of, correlativity, of, perception, if, a, rhythm, is, not, structurally, redundant, then, even, minor, tempo, deviations, are, not, perceived, as, accelerando, or, ritardando, but, rather, given, an, impression, of, a, change, in, rhythm, which, implies, an, inadequate, perception, of, musical, meaning, the, study, of, rhythm, stress, and, pitch, in, speech, is, called, prosody, see, also, prosody, music, it, is, a, topic, in, linguistics, and, poetics, where, it, means, the, number, of, lines, in, a, verse, the, number, of, syllables, in, each, line, and, the, arrangement, of, those, syllables, as, long, or, short, accented, or, unaccented, music, inherited, the, term, meter, or, metre, from, the, terminology, of, poetry, the, metric, structure, of, music, includes, meter, tempo, and, all, other, rhythmic, aspects, that, produce, temporal, regularity, against, which, the, foreground, details, or, durational, patterns, of, the, music, are, projected, the, terminology, of, western, music, is, notoriously, imprecise, in, this, area, macpherson, preferred, to, speak, of, time, and, rhythmic, shape, imogen, holst, of, measured, rhythm, dance, music, has, instantly, recognizable, patterns, of, beats, built, upon, a, characteristic, tempo, and, measure, the, imperial, society, of, teachers, of, dancing, defines, the, tango, for, example, as, to, be, danced, in, 2, 4, time, at, approximately, 66, beats, per, minute, the, basic, slow, step, forwards, or, backwards, lasting, for, one, beat, is, called, a, slow, so, that, a, full, right, left, step, is, equal, to, one, 2, 4, measure, see, rhythm, and, dance, the, general, classifications, of, metrical, rhythm, measured, rhythm, and, free, rhythm, may, be, distinguished, metrical, or, divisive, rhythm, by, far, the, most, common, in, western, music, calculates, each, time, value, as, a, multiple, or, fraction, of, the, beat, normal, accents, re, occur, regularly, providing, systematical, grouping, measures, measured, rhythm, additive, rhythm, also, calculates, each, time, value, as, a, multiple, or, fraction, of, a, specified, time, unit, but, the, accents, do, not, recur, regularly, within, the, cycle, free, rhythm, is, where, there, is, neither, such, as, in, christian, chant, which, has, a, basic, pulse, but, a, freer, rhythm, like, the, rhythm, of, prose, compared, to, that, of, verse, see, free, time, music, finally, some, music, such, as, some, graphically, scored, works, since, the, 1950s, and, non, european, music, such, as, honkyoku, repertoire, for, shakuhachi, may, be, considered, ametric, senza, misura, is, an, italian, musical, term, for, without, meter, meaning, to, play, without, a, beat, using, time, to, measure, how, long, it, will, take, to, play, the, bar, a, composite, rhythm, is, the, durations, and, patterns, rhythm, produced, by, amalgamating, all, sounding, parts, of, a, musical, texture, in, music, of, the, common, practice, period, the, composite, rhythm, usually, confirms, the, meter, often, in, metric, or, even, note, patterns, identical, to, the, pulse, on, a, specific, metric, level, white, defines, composite, rhythm, as, the, resultant, overall, rhythmic, articulation, among, all, the, voices, of, a, contrapuntal, texture, this, concept, was, concurrently, defined, as, attack, point, rhythm, by, maury, yeston, in, 1976, as, the, extreme, rhythmic, foreground, of, a, composition, the, absolute, surface, of, articulated, movement, in, the, griot, tradition, of, africa, everything, related, to, music, has, been, passed, on, orally, babatunde, olatunji, 1927, 2003, developed, a, simple, series, of, spoken, sounds, for, teaching, the, rhythms, of, the, hand, drum, using, six, vocal, sounds, goon, doon, go, do, pa, ta, for, three, basic, sounds, on, the, drum, each, played, with, either, the, left, or, the, right, hand, the, debate, about, the, appropriateness, of, staff, notation, for, african, music, is, a, subject, of, particular, interest, to, outsiders, while, african, scholars, from, kyagambiddwa, to, kongo, have, for, the, most, part, accepted, the, conventions, and, limitations, of, staff, notation, and, produced, transcriptions, to, inform, and, enable, discussion, and, debate, john, miller, has, argued, that, west, african, music, is, based, on, the, tension, between, rhythms, polyrhythms, created, by, the, simultaneous, sounding, of, two, or, more, different, rhythms, generally, one, dominant, rhythm, interacting, with, one, or, more, independent, competing, rhythms, these, often, oppose, or, complement, each, other, and, the, dominant, rhythm, moral, values, underpin, a, musical, system, based, on, repetition, of, relatively, simple, patterns, that, meet, at, distant, cross, rhythmic, intervals, and, on, call, and, response, form, collective, utterances, such, as, proverbs, or, lineages, appear, either, in, phrases, translated, into, drum, talk, or, in, the, words, of, songs, people, expect, musicians, to, stimulate, participation, by, reacting, to, people, dancing, appreciation, of, musicians, is, related, to, the, effectiveness, of, their, upholding, community, values, indian, music, has, also, been, passed, on, orally, tabla, players, would, learn, to, speak, complex, rhythm, patterns, and, phrases, before, attempting, to, play, them, sheila, chandra, an, english, pop, singer, of, indian, descent, made, performances, based, on, her, singing, these, patterns, in, indian, classical, music, the, tala, of, a, composition, is, the, rhythmic, pattern, over, which, the, whole, piece, is, structured, in, the, 20th, century, composers, like, igor, stravinsky, b, la, bart, k, philip, glass, and, steve, reich, wrote, more, rhythmically, complex, music, using, odd, meters, and, techniques, such, as, phasing, and, additive, rhythm, at, the, same, time, modernists, such, as, olivier, messiaen, and, his, pupils, used, increased, complexity, to, disrupt, the, sense, of, a, regular, beat, leading, eventually, to, the, widespread, use, of, irrational, rhythms, in, new, complexity, this, use, may, be, explained, by, a, comment, of, john, cage, s, where, he, notes, that, regular, rhythms, cause, sounds, to, be, heard, as, a, group, rather, than, individually, the, irregular, rhythms, highlight, the, rapidly, changing, pitch, relationships, that, would, otherwise, be, subsumed, into, irrelevant, rhythmic, groupings, la, monte, young, also, wrote, music, in, which, the, sense, of, a, regular, beat, is, absent, because, the, music, consists, only, of, long, sustained, tones, drones, in, the, 1930s, henry, cowell, wrote, music, involving, multiple, simultaneous, periodic, rhythms, and, collaborated, with, leon, theremin, to, invent, the, rhythmicon, the, first, electronic, rhythm, machine, in, order, to, perform, them, similarly, conlon, nancarrow, wrote, for, the, player, piano, in, linguistics, rhythm, or, isochrony, is, one, of, the, three, aspects, of, prosody, along, with, stress, and, intonation, languages, can, be, categorized, according, to, whether, they, are, syllable, timed, mora, timed, or, stress, timed, speakers, of, syllable, timed, languages, such, as, spanish, and, cantonese, put, roughly, equal, time, on, each, syllable, in, contrast, speakers, of, stressed, timed, languages, such, as, english, and, mandarin, chinese, put, roughly, equal, time, lags, between, stressed, syllables, with, the, timing, of, the, unstressed, syllables, in, between, them, being, adjusted, to, accommodate, the, stress, timing, narmour, describes, three, categories, of, prosodic, rules, that, create, rhythmic, successions, that, are, additive, same, duration, repeated, cumulative, short, long, or, countercumulative, long, short, cumulation, is, associated, with, closure, or, relaxation, countercumulation, with, openness, or, tension, while, additive, rhythms, are, open, ended, and, repetitive, richard, middleton, points, out, this, method, cannot, account, for, syncopation, and, suggests, the, concept, of, transformation
