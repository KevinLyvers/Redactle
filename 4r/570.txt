maggiore, was, used, before, it, was, rebuilt, on, the, same, site, as, the, sistine, chapel, the, cappella, maggiore, derived, its, name, the, greater, chapel, from, the, fact, that, there, was,

music, has, been, written, the, most, famous, piece, being, gregorio, allegri, s, miserere, one, of, the, functions, of, the, sistine, chapel, is, as, a, venue, for, the, election, of, each, successive, pope, in, a, conclave, of, the, college, of, cardinals, on, the, occasion, of, a, conclave, a, chimney, is, installed, in, the, roof, of, the, chapel, from, which, smoke, arises, as, a, signal, if, white, smoke, which, is, created, by, burning, the, ballots, of, the, election, appears, a, new, pope, has, been, elected, if, no, candidate, receives, the, required, two, thirds, vote, the, cardinals, send, up, black, smoke, created, by, burning, the, ballots, along, with, wet, straw, and, chemical, additives, it, means, that, no, successful, election, has, yet, occurred, the, first, papal, conclave, to, be, held, on, the, sistine, chapel, was, the, conclave, of, 1492, which, took, place, from, 6, to, 11, august, of, the, same, year, and, in, which, pope, alexander, vi, also, known, as, rodrigo, borja, was, elected, the, conclave, also, provided, for, the, cardinals, a, space, in, which, they, could, hear, mass, and, in, which, they, could, eat, sleep, and, pass, time, attended, by, servants, from, 1455, conclaves, have, been, held, in, the, vatican, palace, until, the, great, schism, they, were, held, in, the, dominican, convent, of, santa, maria, sopra, minerva, since, 1996, john, paul, ii, s, apostolic, constitution, universi, dominici, gregis, requires, the, cardinals, to, be, lodged, in, the, domus, sanctae, marthae, during, a, papal, conclave, but, to, continue, to, vote, in, the, sistine, chapel, canopies, for, each, cardinal, elector, were, once, used, during, conclaves, a, sign, of, equal, dignity, after, the, new, pope, accepts, his, election, he, would, give, his, new, name, at, this, time, the, other, cardinals, would, tug, on, a, rope, attached, to, their, seats, to, lower, their, canopies, until, reforms, instituted, by, saint, pius, x, the, canopies, were, of, different, colours, to, designate, which, cardinals, had, been, appointed, by, which, pope, paul, vi, abolished, the, canopies, altogether, since, under, his, papacy, the, population, of, the, college, of, cardinals, had, increased, so, much, to, the, point, that, they, would, need, to, be, seated, in, rows, of, two, against, the, walls, making, the, canopies, obstruct, the, view, of, the, cardinals, in, the, back, row, in, the, wake, of, a, conclave, taking, place, to, preserve, the, integrity, of, the, marble, floor, on, the, sistine, chapel, carpenters, install, a, slightly, elevated, wooden, floor, alongside, a, wooden, ramp, in, the, entrance, for, those, cardinals, who, for, one, reason, or, another, need, to, be, transported, in, a, wheelchair, the, chapel, is, about, 35, metres, 118, feet, long, and, 14, m, 46, ft, wide, with, the, ceiling, rising, to, about, 20, m, 66, ft, above, the, main, floor, 28, its, exterior, is, unadorned, by, architectural, or, decorative, details, as, is, common, in, many, italian, churches, of, the, medieval, and, renaissance, eras, it, has, no, exterior, fa, ade, or, exterior, processional, doorways, as, the, ingress, has, always, been, from, internal, rooms, within, the, apostolic, palace, papal, palace, and, the, exterior, can, be, seen, only, from, nearby, windows, and, light, wells, in, the, palace, subsidence, and, cracking, of, masonry, also, have, affected, the, cappella, maggiore, necessitating, the, building, of, very, large, buttresses, to, brace, the, exterior, walls, the, accretion, of, other, buildings, has, further, altered, the, exterior, appearance, of, the, chapel, the, building, is, divided, into, three, stories, of, which, the, lowest, is, a, very, tall, basement, level, with, several, utilitarian, windows, and, a, doorway, giving, onto, the, exterior, court, internally, the, basement, is, robustly, vaulted, to, support, the, chapel, the, building, had, six, tall, arched, windows, down, each, side, and, two, at, either, end, several, of, which, have, been, blocked, above, the, vault, is, a, third, story, with, wardrooms, for, guards, at, this, level, an, open, projecting, gangway, was, constructed, which, encircled, the, building, supported, on, an, arcade, springing, from, the, walls, the, gangway, has, been, roofed, as, it, was, a, continual, source, of, water, leaking, into, the, vault, of, the, chapel, the, general, proportions, of, the, chapel, use, the, length, as, the, unit, of, measurement, this, has, been, divided, by, three, to, get, the, width, and, by, two, to, get, the, height, maintaining, the, ratio, there, were, six, windows, down, each, side, and, two, at, either, end, defined, proportions, were, a, feature, of, renaissance, architecture, and, reflected, the, growing, interest, in, the, classical, heritage, of, rome, the, ceiling, of, the, chapel, is, a, flattened, barrel, vault, springing, from, a, course, that, encircles, the, walls, at, the, level, of, the, springing, of, the, window, arches, this, barrel, vault, is, cut, transversely, by, smaller, vaults, over, each, window, which, divide, the, barrel, vault, at, its, lowest, level, into, a, series, of, large, pendentives, rising, from, shallow, pilasters, between, each, window, the, barrel, vault, was, originally, painted, brilliant, blue, and, dotted, with, gold, stars, to, the, design, of, piermatteo, lauro, de, manfredi, da, amelia, the, pavement, is, in, opus, alexandrinum, a, decorative, style, using, marble, and, coloured, stone, in, a, pattern, that, reflects, the, earlier, proportion, in, the, division, of, the, interior, and, also, marks, the, processional, way, from, the, main, door, used, by, the, pope, on, important, occasions, such, as, palm, sunday, a, screen, or, transenna, in, marble, by, mino, da, fiesole, andrea, bregno, and, giovanni, dalmata, divides, the, chapel, into, two, parts, originally, these, made, equal, space, for, the, members, of, the, papal, chapel, within, the, sanctuary, near, the, altar, and, the, pilgrims, and, townsfolk, without, however, with, growth, in, the, number, of, those, attending, the, pope, the, screen, was, moved, giving, a, reduced, area, for, the, faithful, laity, the, transenna, is, surmounted, by, a, row, of, ornate, candlesticks, once, gilt, and, has, a, wooden, door, where, once, there, was, an, ornate, door, of, gilded, wrought, iron, the, sculptors, of, the, transenna, also, provided, the, cantoria, or, projecting, choir, gallery, the, first, stage, in, the, decoration, of, the, sistine, chapel, was, the, painting, of, the, ceiling, in, blue, studded, with, gilt, stars, and, with, decorative, borders, around, the, architectural, details, of, the, pendentives, this, was, entirely, replaced, when, michelangelo, came, to, work, on, the, ceiling, in, 1508, of, the, present, scheme, of, frescos, the, earliest, part, is, that, of, the, side, walls, they, are, divided, into, three, main, tiers, the, central, tier, of, the, walls, has, two, cycles, of, paintings, which, complement, each, other, the, life, of, moses, and, the, life, of, christ, they, were, commissioned, in, 1480, by, pope, sixtus, iv, and, executed, by, domenico, ghirlandaio, sandro, botticelli, pietro, perugino, cosimo, rosselli, and, their, workshops, they, originally, ran, all, round, the, walls, but, have, since, been, replaced, on, both, end, walls, the, project, was, perhaps, supervised, by, perugino, who, arrived, at, the, chapel, prior, to, the, florentines, it, is, probable, that, the, commission, of, ghirlandaio, botticelli, and, roselli, was, part, of, a, reconciliation, project, between, lorenzo, de, medici, the, de, facto, ruler, of, florence, and, pope, sixtus, iv, the, florentines, started, to, work, in, the, sistine, chapel, in, the, spring, of, 1481, beneath, the, cycles, of, the, life, of, moses, and, the, life, of, christ, the, lower, level, of, the, walls, is, decorated, with, frescoed, hangings, in, silver, and, gold, above, the, narrative, frescos, the, upper, tier, is, divided, into, two, zones, at, the, lower, level, of, the, windows, is, a, gallery, of, popes, painted, at, the, same, time, as, the, lives, around, the, arched, tops, of, the, windows, are, areas, known, as, the, lunettes, which, contain, the, ancestors, of, christ, painted, by, michelangelo, as, part, of, the, scheme, for, the, ceiling, the, ceiling, was, commissioned, by, pope, julius, ii, and, painted, by, michelangelo, between, 1508, and, 1512, the, commission, was, originally, to, paint, the, twelve, apostles, on, the, triangular, pendentives, which, support, the, vault, however, michelangelo, demanded, a, free, hand, in, the, pictorial, content, of, the, scheme, he, painted, a, series, of, nine, pictures, showing, god, s, creation, of, the, world, god, s, relationship, with, mankind, and, mankind, s, fall, from, god, s, grace, on, the, large, pendentives, he, painted, twelve, biblical, and, classical, men, and, women, who, prophesied, that, god, would, send, jesus, christ, for, the, salvation, of, mankind, and, around, the, upper, parts, of, the, windows, the, ancestors, of, christ, in, 1515, raphael, was, commissioned, by, pope, leo, x, to, design, a, series, of, ten, tapestries, to, hang, around, the, lower, tier, of, the, walls, the, tapestries, depict, events, from, the, life, of, st, peter, the, life, of, st, paul, the, founders, of, the, christian, church, in, rome, as, described, in, the, gospels, and, the, acts, of, the, apostles, work, began, in, mid, 1515, due, to, their, large, size, manufacture, of, the, hangings, was, carried, out, in, brussels, and, took, four, years, under, the, hands, of, the, weavers, in, the, shop, of, pieter, van, aelst, raphael, s, tapestries, were, looted, during, the, sack, of, rome, in, 1527, and, were, either, burnt, for, their, precious, metal, content, or, were, scattered, around, europe, in, the, late, 20th, century, a, set, was, reassembled, from, several, further, sets, that, had, been, made, after, the, first, set, and, displayed, again, in, the, sistine, chapel, in, 1983, the, tapestries, continue, to, be, used, at, occasional, ceremonies, of, particular, importance, the, full, size, preparatory, cartoons, for, seven, of, the, 10, tapestries, are, known, as, the, raphael, cartoons, and, are, in, london, at, this, point, the, decorative, scheme, displayed, a, consistent, iconographical, pattern, the, tier, of, popes, which, in, the, scheme, intended, by, pope, julius, would, have, appeared, immediately, below, the, twelve, apostles, would, have, emphasised, the, apostolic, succession, it, has, been, argued, that, the, present, scheme, shows, the, two, biblical, testaments, merged, in, order, to, reveal, the, old, predicting, and, framing, the, new, synthesizing, the, logic, of, the, christian, bible, this, was, disrupted, by, a, further, commission, to, michelangelo, to, decorate, the, wall, above, the, altar, with, the, last, judgment, 1537, 1541, the, painting, of, this, scene, necessitated, the, obliteration, of, two, episodes, from, the, lives, the, nativity, of, jesus, and, the, finding, of, moses, several, of, the, popes, and, two, sets, of, ancestors, the, southern, wall, is, decorated, with, the, stories, of, moses, painted, in, 1481, 1482, starting, from, the, altar, they, include, the, northern, wall, houses, the, stories, of, jesus, dating, to, 1481, 1482, they, include, michelangelo, was, commissioned, by, pope, julius, ii, in, 1508, to, repaint, the, vault, or, ceiling, of, the, chapel, the, work, was, completed, between, 1508, and, late, 1512, he, painted, the, last, judgment, over, the, altar, between, 1535, and, 1541, on, commission, from, pope, paul, iii, farnese, michelangelo, was, intimidated, by, the, scale, of, the, commission, and, made, it, known, from, the, outset, of, julius, ii, s, approach, that, he, would, prefer, to, decline, he, felt, he, was, more, of, a, sculptor, than, a, painter, and, was, suspicious, that, such, a, large, scale, project, was, being, offered, to, him, by, enemies, as, a, set, up, for, an, inevitable, fall, for, michelangelo, the, project, was, a, distraction, from, the, major, marble, sculpture, that, had, preoccupied, him, for, the, previous, few, years, the, sources, of, michelangelo, s, inspiration, are, not, easily, determined, both, joachite, and, augustinian, theologians, were, within, the, sphere, of, julius, influence, to, be, able, to, reach, the, ceiling, michelangelo, needed, a, support, the, first, idea, was, by, julius, favoured, architect, donato, bramante, who, wanted, to, build, for, him, a, scaffold, to, be, suspended, in, the, air, with, ropes, however, bramante, did, not, successfully, complete, the, task, and, the, structure, he, built, was, flawed, he, had, perforated, the, vault, in, order, to, lower, strings, to, secure, the, scaffold, michelangelo, laughed, when, he, saw, the, structure, and, believed, it, would, leave, holes, in, the, ceiling, once, the, work, was, ended, he, asked, bramante, what, was, to, happen, when, the, painter, reached, the, perforations, but, the, architect, had, no, answer, the, matter, was, taken, before, the, pope, who, ordered, michelangelo, to, build, a, scaffold, of, his, own, michelangelo, created, a, flat, wooden, platform, on, brackets, built, out, from, holes, in, the, wall, high, up, near, the, top, of, the, windows, contrary, to, popular, belief, he, did, not, lie, on, this, scaffolding, while, he, painted, but, painted, from, a, standing, position, michelangelo, used, bright, colours, easily, visible, from, the, floor, on, the, lowest, part, of, the, ceiling, he, painted, the, ancestors, of, christ, above, this, he, alternated, male, and, female, prophets, with, jonah, over, the, altar, on, the, highest, section, michelangelo, painted, nine, stories, from, the, book, of, genesis, he, was, originally, commissioned, to, paint, only, twelve, figures, the, apostles, he, turned, down, the, commission, because, he, saw, himself, as, a, sculptor, not, a, painter, the, pope, offered, to, allow, michelangelo, to, paint, biblical, scenes, of, his, own, choice, as, a, compromise, after, the, work, was, finished, there, were, more, than, three, hundred, figures, his, figures, showed, the, creation, adam, and, eve, in, the, garden, of, eden, and, the, great, flood, the, painted, area, is, about, 40, m, 131, ft, long, by, 13, m, 43, ft, wide, this, means, that, michelangelo, painted, well, over, 5, 000, square, feet, 460, m, 2, of, frescoes, the, last, judgement, was, painted, by, michelangelo, from, 1535, to, 1541, between, two, important, historic, events, the, sack, of, rome, by, mercenary, forces, of, the, holy, roman, empire, in, 1527, and, the, council, of, trent, which, commenced, in, 1545, the, work, was, designed, on, a, grand, scale, and, spans, the, entire, wall, behind, the, altar, of, the, sistine, chapel, the, painting, depicts, the, second, coming, of, christ, on, the, day, of, judgment, as, described, in, the, revelation, of, john, chapter, 20, high, on, the, wall, is, the, heroic, figure, of, christ, with, the, saints, clustered, in, groups, around, him, at, the, bottom, left, of, the, painting, the, dead, are, raised, from, their, graves, and, ascend, to, be, judged, to, the, right, are, those, who, are, assigned, to, hell, and, are, dragged, down, by, demons, the, last, judgement, was, an, object, of, a, bitter, dispute, between, cardinal, carafa, and, michelangelo, because, he, depicted, naked, figures, the, artist, was, accused, of, immorality, and, obscenity, a, censorship, campaign, known, as, the, fig, leaf, campaign, was, organized, by, carafa, and, monsignor, sernini, mantua, s, ambassador, to, remove, the, frescoes, from, this, campaign, drew, support, for, the, more, natural, state, of, the, figures, in, response, phallic, imagery, began, permeating, throughout, vatican, city, beginning, the, trend, of, the, crude, drawings, in, places, such, as, in, graffiti, art, in, bathrooms, textbooks, and, other, public, places, to, be, easily, found, this, trend, continues, to, the, present, day, the, pope, s, master, of, ceremonies, biagio, da, cesena, said, it, was, most, disgraceful, that, in, so, sacred, a, place, there, should, have, been, depicted, all, those, nude, figures, exposing, themselves, so, shamefully, and, that, it, was, no, work, for, a, papal, chapel, but, rather, for, the, public, baths, and, taverns, in, response, michelangelo, worked, da, cesena, s, semblance, into, the, scene, as, minos, judge, of, the, underworld, it, is, said, that, when, he, complained, to, the, pope, the, pontiff, responded, that, his, jurisdiction, did, not, extend, to, hell, so, the, portrait, would, have, to, remain, michelangelo, also, painted, his, own, portrait, on, the, flayed, skin, held, by, st, bartholomew, the, genitalia, in, the, fresco, were, later, covered, by, the, artist, daniele, da, volterra, whom, history, remembers, by, the, derogatory, nickname, il, braghettone, the, breeches, painter, the, sistine, chapel, s, ceiling, restoration, began, on, 7, november, 1984, when, the, restoration, was, completed, the, chapel, was, re, opened, to, the, public, on, 8, april, 1994, the, part, of, the, restoration, in, the, sistine, chapel, that, has, caused, the, most, concern, is, the, ceiling, painted, by, michelangelo, the, emergence, of, the, brightly, coloured, ancestors, of, christ, from, the, gloom, sparked, a, reaction, of, fear, that, the, processes, being, employed, in, the, cleaning, were, too, severe, and, removed, the, original, intent, of, the, artist, the, problem, lies, in, the, analysis, and, understanding, of, the, techniques, utilised, by, michelangelo, and, the, technical, response, of, the, restorers, to, that, understanding, a, close, examination, of, the, frescoes, of, the, lunettes, convinced, the, restorers, that, michelangelo, worked, exclusively, in, buon, fresco, that, is, the, artist, worked, only, on, freshly, laid, plaster, and, each, section, of, work, was, completed, while, the, plaster, was, still, in, its, fresh, state, in, other, words, they, believed, michelangelo, did, not, work, a, secco, he, did, not, come, back, later, and, add, details, onto, the, dry, plaster, the, restorers, by, assuming, that, the, artist, took, a, universal, approach, to, the, painting, have, taken, a, universal, approach, to, the, restoration, a, decision, was, made, that, all, of, the, shadowy, layer, of, animal, glue, and, lamp, black, all, of, the, wax, and, all, of, the, overpainted, areas, were, contamination, of, one, sort, or, another, smoke, deposits, earlier, restoration, attempts, and, painted, definition, by, later, restorers, in, an, attempt, to, enliven, the, appearance, of, the, work, based, on, this, decision, according, to, arguimbau, s, critical, reading, of, the, restoration, data, that, have, been, provided, the, chemists, of, the, restoration, team, decided, upon, a, solvent, that, would, effectively, strip, the, ceiling, down, to, its, paint, impregnated, plaster, after, treatment, only, that, which, was, painted, buon, fresco, would, remain, the, only, reproduction, of, the, sistine, chapel, ceiling, was, painted, by, gary, bevans, at, english, martyrs, catholic, church, in, goring, by, sea, worthing, west, sussex, england, a, full, size, architectural, and, photographic, replica, of, the, entire, building, was, commissioned, by, the, mexican, government, and, funded, by, private, donors, it, was, on, view, at, mexico, city, from, 1, june, to, 15, july, 2016, it, took, 2, 6, million, high, definition, photographs, to,
