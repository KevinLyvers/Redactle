the, organon, ancient, greek, meaning, instrument, tool, organ, is, the, standard, collection, of, aristotle, s, six, works, on, logical, analysis, and, dialectic, the, name, organon, was, given, by, aristotle, s, followers, the, peripatetics, who, maintained, against, the, stoics, that, logic, was, an, instrument, of, philosophy, aristotle, never, uses, the, title, organon, to, refer, to, his, logical, works, the, book, according, to, m, barth, lemy, st, hilaire, was, not, called, organon, before, the, 15th, century, and, the, treatises, were, collected, into, one, volume, as, is, supposed, about, the, time, of, andronicus, of, rhodes, and, it, was, translated, into, latin, by, boethius, about, the, 6th, century, the, six, works, of, organon, are, as, follows, the, order, of, the, works, is, not, chronological, which, is, now, hard, to, determine, but, was, deliberately, chosen, by, theophrastus, to, constitute, a, well, structured, system, indeed, parts, of, them, seem, to, be, a, scheme, of, a, lecture, on, logic, the, arrangement, of, the, works, was, made, by, andronicus, of, rhodes, around, 40, bc, aristotle, s, metaphysics, has, some, points, of, overlap, with, the, works, making, up, the, organon, but, is, not, traditionally, considered, part, of, it, additionally, there, are, works, on, logic, attributed, with, varying, degrees, of, plausibility, to, aristotle, that, were, not, known, to, the, peripatetics, whereas, the, organon, of, the, latin, scholastic, tradition, comprises, only, the, above, six, works, its, independent, reception, in, the, arabic, medieval, world, saw, appended, to, this, list, of, works, aristotle, s, rhetoric, and, poetics, the, organon, was, used, in, the, school, founded, by, aristotle, at, the, lyceum, and, some, parts, of, the, works, seem, to, be, a, scheme, of, a, lecture, on, logic, so, much, so, that, after, aristotle, s, death, his, publishers, andronicus, of, rhodes, in, 50, bc, for, example, collected, these, works, following, the, collapse, of, the, western, roman, empire, in, the, fifth, century, much, of, aristotle, s, work, was, lost, in, the, latin, west, the, categories, and, on, interpretation, are, the, only, significant, logical, works, that, were, available, in, the, early, middle, ages, these, had, been, translated, into, latin, by, boethius, along, with, porphyry, s, isagoge, which, was, also, translated, into, arabic, by, ibn, al, muqaffa, via, a, syriac, intermediary, the, other, logical, works, were, not, available, in, western, christendom, until, translated, into, latin, in, the, 12th, century, however, the, original, greek, texts, had, been, preserved, in, the, greek, speaking, lands, of, the, eastern, roman, empire, aka, byzantium, in, the, mid, twelfth, century, james, of, venice, translated, into, latin, the, posterior, analytics, from, greek, manuscripts, found, in, constantinople, the, books, of, aristotle, were, available, in, the, early, muslim, world, and, after, 750, ad, muslims, had, most, of, them, including, the, organon, translated, into, arabic, normally, via, earlier, syriac, translations, they, were, studied, by, islamic, and, jewish, scholars, including, rabbi, moses, maimonides, 1135, 1204, and, the, muslim, judge, ibn, rushd, known, in, the, west, as, averroes, 1126, 1198, both, were, originally, from, c, rdoba, spain, although, the, former, left, iberia, and, by, 1168, lived, in, egypt, all, the, major, scholastic, philosophers, wrote, commentaries, on, the, organon, aquinas, ockham, and, scotus, wrote, commentaries, on, on, interpretation, ockham, and, scotus, wrote, commentaries, on, the, categories, and, sophistical, refutations, grosseteste, wrote, an, influential, commentary, on, the, posterior, analytics, in, the, enlightenment, there, was, a, revival, of, interest, in, logic, as, the, basis, of, rational, enquiry, and, a, number, of, texts, most, successfully, the, port, royal, logic, polished, aristotelian, term, logic, for, pedagogy, during, this, period, while, the, logic, certainly, was, based, on, that, of, aristotle, aristotle, s, writings, themselves, were, less, often, the, basis, of, study, there, was, a, tendency, in, this, period, to, regard, the, logical, systems, of, the, day, to, be, complete, which, in, turn, no, doubt, stifled, innovation, in, this, area, however, francis, bacon, published, his, novum, organum, the, new, organon, as, a, scathing, attack, in, 1620, immanuel, kant, thought, that, there, was, nothing, else, to, invent, after, the, work, of, aristotle, and, the, famous, logic, historian, karl, von, prantl, claimed, that, any, logician, who, said, anything, new, about, logic, was, confused, stupid, or, perverse, these, examples, illustrate, the, force, of, influence, which, aristotle, s, works, on, logic, had, indeed, he, had, already, become, known, by, the, scholastics, medieval, christian, scholars, as, the, philosopher, due, to, the, influence, he, had, upon, medieval, theology, and, philosophy, his, influence, continued, into, the, early, modern, period, and, organon, was, the, basis, of, school, philosophy, even, in, the, beginning, of, the, 18th, century, since, the, logical, innovations, of, the, 19th, century, particularly, the, formulation, of, modern, predicate, logic, aristotelian, logic, had, for, a, time, fallen, out, of, favor, among, many, analytic, philosophers, however, the, logic, historian, john, corcoran, and, others, have, shown, that, the, works, of, george, boole, and, gottlob, frege, which, laid, the, groundwork, for, modern, mathematical, logic, each, represent, a, continuation, and, extension, to, aristotle, s, logic, and, in, no, way, contradict, or, displace, it, boole, fully, accepted, and, endorsed, aristotle, s, logic, and, frege, included, aristotle, s, square, of, opposition, at, the, end, of, his, groundbreaking, begriffsschrift, to, show, the, harmony, of, his, theory, with, the, aristotelian, tradition, primary, sources, studies
