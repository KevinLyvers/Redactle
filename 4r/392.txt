bossa, nova, portuguese, pronunciation, is, a, relaxed, style, of, samba, developed, in, the, late, 1950s, and, early, 1960s, in, rio, de, janeiro, brazil, it, is, mainly, characterized, by, a, calm, syncopated, rhythm, with, chords, and, fingerstyle, mimicking, the, beat, of, a, samba, groove, as, if, it, was, a, simplification, and, stylization, on, the, guitar, of, the, rhythm, produced, by, a, samba, school, band, another, defining, characteristic, of, the, style, is, the, use, of, unconventional, chords, in, some, cases, with, complex, progressions, and, ambiguous, harmonies, a, common, misconception, is, that, these, complex, chords, and, harmonies, were, derived, from, jazz, but, samba, guitar, players, have, been, using, similar, arrangement, structures, since, the, early, 1920s, indicating, a, case, of, parallel, evolution, of, styles, rather, than, a, simple, transference, from, jazz, to, bossa, nova, nevertheless, bossa, nova, was, influenced, by, jazz, both, in, the, harmonies, used, and, also, by, the, instrumentation, of, songs, today, many, bossa, nova, songs, are, considered, jazz, standards, the, increase, in, popularity, of, bossa, nova, has, helped, to, renew, samba, and, contributed, to, the, modernization, of, brazilian, music, in, general, one, of, the, major, innovations, of, bossa, nova, was, the, way, to, synthesize, the, rhythm, of, samba, on, the, classical, guitar, according, to, musicologist, gilberto, mendes, the, bossa, nova, was, one, of, the, three, rhythmic, phases, of, samba, in, which, the, bossa, beat, had, been, extracted, by, jo, o, gilberto, from, the, traditional, samba, the, synthesis, performed, by, gilberto, s, guitar, was, a, reduction, of, the, batucada, of, samba, a, stylization, produced, from, one, of, the, percussion, instruments, the, thumb, stylized, a, surdo, the, index, middle, and, ring, fingers, phrased, like, a, tamborim, in, line, with, this, thesis, musicians, such, as, baden, powell, roberto, menescal, and, ronaldo, b, scoli, also, understand, the, bossa, nova, beat, as, being, extracted, from, the, tamborim, play, in, the, bateria, in, brazil, the, word, bossa, is, old, fashioned, slang, for, something, done, with, particular, charm, natural, flair, or, innate, ability, as, early, as, 1932, noel, rosa, used, the, word, in, a, samba, the, phrase, bossa, nova, translated, literally, means, new, trend, or, new, wave, in, portuguese, the, exact, origin, of, the, term, bossa, nova, remained, unclear, for, many, decades, according, to, some, authors, within, the, artistic, beach, culture, of, the, late, 1950s, in, rio, de, janeiro, the, term, bossa, was, used, to, refer, to, any, new, trend, or, fashionable, wave, in, his, book, bossa, nova, brazilian, author, ruy, castro, asserts, that, bossa, was, already, in, use, in, the, 1950s, by, musicians, as, a, word, to, characterize, someone, s, knack, for, playing, or, singing, idiosyncratically, castro, claims, that, the, term, bossa, nova, might, have, first, been, used, in, public, for, a, concert, given, in, 1957, by, the, grupo, universit, rio, hebraico, do, brasil, hebrew, university, group, of, brazil, the, authorship, of, the, term, bossa, nova, is, attributed, to, the, then, young, journalist, moyses, fuks, who, was, promoting, the, event, that, group, consisted, of, sylvia, telles, carlos, lyra, nara, le, o, luiz, e, a, roberto, menescal, and, others, mr, fuks, s, description, fully, supported, by, most, of, the, bossa, nova, members, simply, read, hoje, sylvia, telles, e, um, grupo, bossa, nova,

of, ant, nio, carlos, jobim, and, the, lyrics, of, vinicius, de, moraes, found, immediate, resonance, among, musicians, who, were, looking, for, new, approaches, to, samba, in, rio, de, janeiro, many, of, them, were, influenced, by, american, jazz, in, 1964, jo, o, gilberto, and, stan, getz, released, the, getz, gilberto, album, then, it, emerged, an, artistic, movement, around, gilberto, and,

has, continue, to, influence, popular, music, around, the, world, from, the, 1960s, to, today, an, example, is, the, song, break, on, through, to, the, other, side, by, american, rock, band, the, doors, especially, the, drum, beat, drummer, john, densmore, has, stated, that, he, was, very, influenced, by, the, sounds, of, brazil, when, coming, up, with, the, drum, part, for, the, song, a, more, recent, reference, is, the, icelandic, jazz, pop, singer, laufey, and, her, hit, song, from, the, start, with, its, bossa, nova, infused, rhythm, bossa, nova, is, most, commonly, performed, on, the, nylon, string, classical, guitar, played, with, the, fingers, rather, than, with, a, pick, its, purest, form, could, be, considered, unaccompanied, guitar, with, vocals, as, created, pioneered, and, exemplified, by, jo, o, gilberto, even, in, larger, jazz, like, arrangements, for, groups, there, is, almost, always, a, guitar, that, plays, the, underlying, rhythm, gilberto, basically, took, one, of, the, several, rhythmic, layers, from, a, samba, ensemble, specifically, the, tamborim, and, applied, it, to, the, picking, hand, according, to, brazilian, musician, paulo, bittencourt, jo, o, gilberto, known, for, his, eccentricity, and, obsessed, by, the, idea, of, finding, a, new, way, of, playing, the, guitar, sometimes, locked, himself, in, the, bathroom, where, he, played, one, and, the, same, chord, for, many, hours, in, a, row, as, in, samba, the, surdo, plays, an, ostinato, figure, on, the, downbeat, of, beat, one, the, ah, of, beat, one, the, downbeat, of, beat, two, and, the, ah, of, beat, two, the, clave, pattern, sounds, very, similar, to, the, two, three, or, three, two, son, clave, of, cuban, styles, such, as, mambo, but, is, dissimilar, in, that, the, two, side, of, the, clave, is, pushed, by, an, eighth, note, also, important, in, the, percussion, section, for, bossa, nova, is, the, cabasa, which, plays, a, steady, sixteenth, note, pattern, these, parts, are, easily, adaptable, to, the, drum, set, which, makes, bossa, nova, a, rather, popular, brazilian, style, for, drummers, certain, other, instrumentations, and, vocals, are, also, part, of, the, structure, of, bossa, nova, these, include, bossa, nova, has, at, its, core, a, rhythm, based, on, samba, samba, combines, the, rhythmic, patterns, and, feel, originating, in, afro, brazilian, slave, communities, samba, s, emphasis, on, the, second, beat, carries, through, to, bossa, nova, to, the, degree, that, it, is, often, notated, in, 2, 4, time, however, unlike, samba, bossa, nova, has, no, dance, steps, to, accompany, it, when, played, on, the, guitar, in, a, simple, one, bar, pattern, the, thumb, plays, the, bass, notes, on, 1, and, 2, while, the, fingers, pluck, the, chords, in, unison, on, the, two, eighth, notes, of, beat, one, followed, by, the, second, sixteenth, note, of, beat, two, two, measure, patterns, usually, contain, a, syncopation, into, the, second, measure, overall, the, rhythm, has, a, swaying, feel, rather, than, the, swinging, feel, of, jazz, as, bossa, nova, composer, carlos, lyra, describes, it, in, his, song, influ, ncia, do, jazz, the, samba, rhythm, moves, side, to, side, while, jazz, moves, front, to, back, there, s, also, some, evidence, indicating, a, musical, influence, of, blues, in, bossa, nova, even, thought, this, effect, is, not, immediately, recognized, in, the, genre, structure, aside, from, the, guitar, style, jo, o, gilberto, s, other, innovation, was, the, projection, of, the, singing, voice, prior, to, bossa, nova, brazilian, singers, employed, brassy, almost, operatic, styles, now, the, characteristic, nasal, vocal, production, of, bossa, nova, is, a, peculiar, trait, of, the, caboclo, folk, tradition, of, northeastern, brazil, the, lyrical, themes, found, in, bossa, nova, include, women, love, longing, homesickness, nature, bossa, nova, was, often, apolitical, the, musical, lyrics, of, the, late, 1950s, depicted, the, easy, life, of, the, middle, to, upper, class, brazilians, though, the, majority, of, the, population, was, in, the, working, class, in, conjunction, with, political, developments, of, the, early, 1960s, especially, the, 1964, military, coup, d, tat, the, popularity, of, bossa, nova, was, eclipsed, by, m, sica, popular, brasileira, a, musical, genre, that, appeared, around, the, mid, 1960s, featuring, lyrics, that, were, more, politically, charged, and, focused, on, the, working, class, struggle, bossa, nova, was, also, a, fad, dance, that, corresponded, to, the, music, it, was, introduced, in, the, late, 1950s, and, faded, out, in, the, mid, sixties, bossa, nova, music, with, its, soft, sophisticated, vocal, rhythms, and, improvisations, is, well, suited, for, listening, but, failed, to, become, dance, music, despite, heavy, promotion, in, the, 1960s, the, style, of, basic, dance, steps, suited, the, music, well, it, was, danced, on, soft, knees, that, allowed, for, sideways, sways, with, hip, motions, and, it, could, be, danced, both, solo, and, in, pairs, about, ten, various, simple, step, patterns, were, published, a, variant, of, basic, 8, beat, pattern, was, step, forward, tap, step, back, step, together, repeat, from, the, opposite, foot, a, variation, of, this, pattern, was, a, kind, of, slow, samba, walk, with, step, together, above, replaced, by, replace, box, steps, of, rhumba, and, whisk, steps, of, nightclub, two, step, could, be, fitted, with, bossa, nova, styling, embellishments, included, placing, one, arm, onto, one, s, own, belly, and, waving, another, arm, at, waist, level, in, the, direction, of, the, sway, possibly, with, a, finger, click
