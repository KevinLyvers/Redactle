the, four, string, oud, brought, to, iberia, by, the, moors, in, the, 8th, century, a, direct, ancestor, of, the, modern, guitar, is, the, guitarra, morisca, moorish, guitar, which, was, in, use, in, spain, by, the, 12th, century, by, the, 14th, century, it, was, simply, referred, to, as, a, guitar, a, number, of, medieval, conical, bore, instruments, were, likely, introduced, or, popularized, by, arab, musicians, including, the, xelami, from, zulami, some, scholars, believe, that, the, troubadors, may, have, had, arabian, origins, with, magda, bogin, stating, that, the, arab, poetic, and, musical, tradition, was, one, of, several, influences, on, european, courtly, love, poetry, variste, l, vi, proven, al, and, other, scholars, stated, that, three, lines, of, a, poem, by, william, ix, of, aquitaine, were, in, some, form, of, arabic, indicating, a, potential, andalusian, origin, for, his, works, the, scholars, attempted, to, translate, the, lines, in, question, and, produced, various, different, translations, the, medievalist, istvan, frank, contended, that, the, lines, were, not, arabic, at, all, but, instead, the, result, of, the, rewriting, of, the, original, by, a, later, scribe, the, theory, that, the, troubadour, tradition, was, created, by, william, after, his, experience, of, moorish, arts, while, fighting, with, the, reconquista, in, spain, has, been, championed, by, ram, n, men, ndez, pidal, and, idries, shah, george, t, beech, states, that, there, is, only, one, documented, battle, that, william, fought, in, spain, and, it, occurred, towards, the, end, of, his, life, beech, adds, that, william, and, his, father, did, have, spanish, individuals, within, their, extended, family, and, that, while, there, is, no, evidence, he, himself, knew, arabic, he, may, have, been, friendly, with, some, europeans, who, could, speak, the, language, others, state, that, the, notion, that, william, created, the, concept, of, troubadours, is, itself, incorrect, and, that, his, songs, represent, not, the, beginnings, of, a, tradition, but, summits, of, achievement, in, that, tradition, most, scholars, believe, that, guido, of, arezzo, s, solf, ge, musical, notation, system, had, its, origins, in, a, latin, hymn, but, others, suggest, that, it, may, have, had, arabic, origins, instead, it, has, been, argued, that, the, solf, ge, syllables, do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti, may, have, been, derived, from, the, syllables, of, an, arabic, solmization, system, durr, i, mufassal, separated, pearls, dal, ra, mim, fa, sad, lam, this, was, first, proposed, by, meninski, in, his, thesaurus, linguarum, orientalum, 1680, however, there, is, no, documentary, evidence, for, this, theory, and, no, arabic, musical, manuscripts, using, sequences, from, the, arabic, alphabet, are, known, to, exist, henry, george, farmer, believes, that, there, is, no, firm, evidence, on, the, origins, of, the, notation, and, therefore, the, arabian, origin, theory, and, the, hymnal, origin, theories, are, equally, credible, ethnomusicologist, ali, jihad, racy, talks, about, the, improvisation, style, of, music, that, is, present, in, much, of, the, arab, world, racy, discusses, the, regional, attitudes, towards, improvisation, music, in, the, middle, east, describing, that, improvisation, can, suggest, casual, or, untrained, or, even, non, professional, music, making, this, is, held, only, by, certain, communities, within, the, arabic, world, and, can, differ, from, each, region, or, community, some, regions, look, at, improvisation, music, as, the, intuitive, artistic, ability, that, momentarily, expresses, the, feeling, of, the, player, other, groups, tend, to, view, improvisation, as, though, it, is, the, fulfillment, of, music, transcending, the, classical, maqam, style, or, other, styles, of, music, playing, other, schools, of, thought, on, improvisation, music, in, the, arab, world, believe, that, improvisation, music, shows, a, lack, of, understanding, in, musical, training, racy, does, not, specify, which, groups, have, what, views, rather, the, discussion, is, more, focused, on, the, idea, that, the, arabic, music, world, is, not, monolithic, in, its, view, on, improvisation, in, music, other, groups, view, improvisation, as, only, learned, through, trial, and, error, taking, many, years, to, perfect, thus, being, a, style, played, professionals, a, respected, tradition, in, improvisation, music, is, known, as, taqsim, taqsim, music, uses, a, maqam, and, improvises, the, form, or, structure, of, the, song, which, creates, a, cathartic, experience, for, the, listener, further, the, improvisation, aspects, go, beyond, the, form, and, are, expressed, in, the, quartertones, of, the, song, this, tradition, historically, was, performed, as, a, chant, now, it, is, used, by, performers, on, the, oud, ud, violin, or, nay, a, type, of, flute, this, style, of, improvisation, is, known, for, the, effects, it, can, conjure, up, in, a, listener, listeners, may, laugh, cry, and, shout, at, different, points, in, the, performance, due, to, the, emotions, evoked, by, the, music,

there, are, some, genres, of, arabic, music, that, are, polyphonic, but, typically, arabic, music, is, homophonic, habib, hassan, touma, submits, that, there, are, five, components, that, characterize, arabic, music, the, basis, of, arabic, music, is, the, maqam, pl, maqamat, which, looks, like, the, mode, but, is, not, quite, the, same, the, tonic, note, dominant, note, and, ending, note, unless, modulation, occurs, are, generally, determined, by, the, maqam, used, arabic, maqam, theory, as, described, in, literature, over, the, ages, names, between, 90, and, 110, maqams, that, are, grouped, into, larger, categories, known, as, fasilah, fasilah, are, groupings, of, maqams, whose, first, four, primary, pitches, are, shared, in, common, the, maqam, consists, of, at, least, two, ajnas, or, scale, segments, ajnas, is, the, plural, form, of, jins, which, in, arabic, comes, from, the, latin, word, genus, meaning, type, in, practice, a, jins, is, either, a, trichord, three, notes, a, tetrachord, four, notes, or, a, pentachord, five, notes, a, maqam, usually, covers, only, one, octave, usually, two, ajnas, but, can, cover, more, like, the, melodic, minor, scale, some, maqamat, use, different, ajnas, when, descending, and, ascending, due, to, continuous, innovation, and, the, emergence, of, new, ajnas, and, because, most, music, scholars, have, not, reached, consensus, on, the, subject, a, solid, figure, for, the, total, number, of, ajnas, in, use, is, uncertain, in, practice, however, most, musicians, would, agree, there, are, at, least, eight, major, ajnas, rast, bayat, sikah, hijaz, saba, kurd, nahawand, and, ajam, and, commonly, used, variants, such, as, nakriz, athar, kurd, sikah, beladi, saba, zamzama, for, example, mukhalif, is, a, rare, jins, in, the, sikah, family, used, almost, exclusively, in, iraq, and, it, is, not, used, in, combination, with, other, ajnas, unlike, the, tradition, of, western, music, arabic, music, contains, microtones, which, are, notes, that, lie, between, notes, in, the, western, chromatic, scale, while, notes, in, the, chromatic, scale, are, separated, by, semitones, or, half, steps, notes, in, arabic, music, can, be, separated, by, quarter, tones, in, some, treatments, of, theory, the, quarter, tone, scale, or, all, twenty, four, tones, should, exist, but, according, to, y, suf, shawq, 1969, fewer, tones, are, used, in, practice, additionally, in, 1932, at, the, cairo, congress, of, arab, music, held, in, cairo, egypt, and, attended, by, such, western, luminaries, as, b, la, bart, k, and, henry, george, farmer, experiments, were, done, that, determined, conclusively, that, the, notes, in, actual, use, differ, substantially, from, an, even, tempered, 24, tone, scale, furthermore, the, intonation, of, many, of, those, notes, differ, slightly, from, region, to, region, egypt, turkey, syria, iraq, as, a, result, of, these, findings, the, following, recommendation, was, issued, the, tempered, scale, and, the, natural, scale, should, be, rejected, in, egypt, the, egyptian, scale, is, to, be, kept, with, the, values, which, were, measured, with, all, possible, precision, the, turkish, syrian, and, iraqi, scales, should, remain, what, they, are, both, in, modern, practice, and, evident, in, recorded, music, over, the, course, of, the, last, century, several, differently, tuned, es, in, between, the, e, flat, and, e, natural, of, the, western, chromatic, scale, are, used, that, vary, according, to, the, types, of, maqams, and, ajnas, used, and, the,
