a, joke, is, a, display, of, humour, in, which, words, are, used, within, a, specific, and, well, defined, narrative, structure, to, make, people, laugh, and, is, usually, not, meant, to, be, interpreted, literally, it, usually, takes, the, form, of, a, story, often, with, dialogue, and, ends, in, a, punch, line, whereby, the, humorous, element, of, the, story, is, revealed, this, can, be, done, using, a, pun, or, other, type, of, word, play, irony, or, sarcasm, logical, incompatibility, hyperbole, or, other, means, linguist, robert, hetzron, offers, the, definition, a, joke, is, a, short, humorous, piece, of, oral, literature, in, which, the, funniness, culminates, in, the, final, sentence, called, the, punchline, in, fact, the, main, condition, is, that, the, tension, should, reach, its, highest, level, at, the, very, end, no, continuation, relieving, the, tension, should, be, added, as, for, its, being, oral, it, is, true, that, jokes, may, appear, printed, but, when, further, transferred, there, is, no, obligation, to, reproduce, the, text, verbatim, as, in, the, case, of, poetry, it, is, generally, held, that, jokes, benefit, from, brevity, containing, no, more, detail, than, is, needed, to, set, the, scene, for, the, punchline, at, the, end, in, the, case, of, riddle, jokes, or, one, liners, the, setting, is, implicitly, understood, leaving, only, the, dialogue, and, punchline, to, be, verbalised, however, subverting, these, and, other, common, guidelines, can, also, be, a, source, of, humour, the, shaggy, dog, story, is, an, example, of, an, anti, joke, although, presented, as, a, joke, it, contains, a, long, drawn, out, narrative, of, time, place, and, character, rambles, through, many, pointless, inclusions, and, finally, fails, to, deliver, a, punchline, jokes, are, a, form, of, humour, but, not, all, humour, is, in, the, form, of, a, joke, some, humorous, forms, which, are, not, verbal, jokes, are, involuntary, humour, situational, humour, practical, jokes, slapstick, and, anecdotes, identified, as, one, of, the, simple, forms, of, oral, literature, by, the, dutch, linguist, andr, jolles, jokes, are, passed, along, anonymously, they, are, told, in, both, private, and, public, settings, a, single, person, tells, a, joke, to, his, friend, in, the, natural, flow, of, conversation, or, a, set, of, jokes, is, told, to, a, group, as, part, of, scripted, entertainment, jokes, are, also, passed, along, in, written, form, or, more, recently, through, the, internet, stand, up, comics, comedians, and, slapstick, work, with, comic, timing, and, rhythm, in, their, performance, and, may, rely, on, actions, as, well, as, on, the, verbal, punchline, to, evoke, laughter, this, distinction, has, been, formulated, in, the, popular, saying, a, comic, says, funny, things, a, comedian, says, things, funny, jokes, do, not, belong, to, refined, culture, but, rather, to, the, entertainment, and, leisure, of, all, classes, as, such, any, printed, versions, were, considered, ephemera, i, e, temporary, documents, created, for, a, specific, purpose, and, intended, to, be, thrown, away, many, of, these, early, jokes, deal, with, scatological, and, sexual, topics, entertaining, to, all, social, classes, but, not, to, be, valued, and, saved, various, kinds, of, jokes, have, been, identified, in, ancient, pre, classical, texts, the, oldest, identified, joke, is, an, ancient, sumerian, proverb, from, 1900, bc, containing, toilet, humour, something, which, has, never, occurred, since, time, immemorial, a, young, woman, did, not, fart, in, her, husband, s, lap, its, records, were, dated, to, the, old, babylonian, period, and, the, joke, may, go, as, far, back, as, 2300, bc, the, second, oldest, joke, found, discovered, on, the, westcar, papyrus, and, believed, to, be, about, sneferu, was, from, ancient, egypt, c, 1600, bc, how, do, you, entertain, a, bored, pharaoh, you, sail, a, boatload, of, young, women, dressed, only, in, fishing, nets, down, the, nile, and, urge, the, pharaoh, to, go, catch, a, fish, the, tale, of, the, three, ox, drivers, from, adab, completes, the, three, known, oldest, jokes, in, the, world, this, is, a, comic, triple, dating, back, to, 1200, bc, adab, it, concerns, three, men, seeking, justice, from, a, king, on, the, matter, of, ownership, over, a, newborn, calf, for, whose, birth, they, all, consider, themselves, to, be, partially, responsible, the, king, seeks, advice, from, a, priestess, on, how, to, rule, the, case, and, she, suggests, a, series, of, events, involving, the, men, s, households, and, wives, the, final, portion, of, the, story, which, included, the, punch, line, has, not, survived, intact, though, legible, fragments, suggest, it, was, bawdy, in, nature, jokes, can, be, notoriously, difficult, to, translate, from, language, to, language, particularly, puns, which, depend, on, specific, words, and, not, just, on, their, meanings, for, instance, julius, caesar, once, sold, land, at, a, surprisingly, cheap, price, to, his, lover, servilia, who, was, rumoured, to, be, prostituting, her, daughter, tertia, to, caesar, in, order, to, keep, his, favour, cicero, remarked, that, conparavit, servilia, hunc, fundum, tertia, deducta, the, punny, phrase, tertia, deducta, can, be, translated, as, with, one, third, off, in, price, or, with, tertia, putting, out, the, earliest, extant, joke, book, is, the, philogelos, greek, for, the, laughter, lover, a, collection, of, 265, jokes, written, in, crude, ancient, greek, dating, to, the, fourth, or, fifth, century, ad, the, author, of, the, collection, is, obscure, and, a, number, of, different, authors, are, attributed, to, it, including, hierokles, and, philagros, the, grammatikos, just, hierokles, or, in, the, suda, philistion, british, classicist, mary, beard, states, that, the, philogelos, may, have, been, intended, as, a, jokester, s, handbook, of, quips, to, say, on, the, fly, rather, than, a, book, meant, to, be, read, straight, through, many, of, the, jokes, in, this, collection, are, surprisingly, familiar, even, though, the, typical, protagonists, are, less, recognisable, to, contemporary, readers, the, absent, minded, professor, the, eunuch, and, people, with, hernias, or, bad, breath, the, philogelos, even, contains, a, joke, similar, to, monty, python, s, dead, parrot, sketch, during, the, 15th, century, the, printing, revolution, spread, across, europe, following, the, development, of, the, movable, type, printing, press, this, was, coupled, with, the, growth, of, literacy, in, all, social, classes, printers, turned, out, jestbooks, along, with, bibles, to, meet, both, lowbrow, and, highbrow, interests, of, the, populace, one, early, anthology, of, jokes, was, the, facetiae, by, the, italian, poggio, bracciolini, first, published, in, 1470, the, popularity, of, this, jest, book, can, be, measured, on, the, twenty, editions, of, the, book, documented, alone, for, the, 15th, century, another, popular, form, was, a, collection, of, jests, jokes, and, funny, situations, attributed, to, a, single, character, in, a, more, connected, narrative, form, of, the, picaresque, novel, examples, of, this, are, the, characters, of, rabelais, in, france, till, eulenspiegel, in, germany, lazarillo, de, tormes, in, spain, and, master, skelton, in, england, there, is, also, a, jest, book, ascribed, to, william, shakespeare, the, contents, of, which, appear, to, both, inform, and, borrow, from, his, plays, all, of, these, early, jestbooks, corroborate, both, the, rise, in, the, literacy, of, the, european, populations, and, the, general, quest, for, leisure, activities, during, the, renaissance, in, europe, the, practice, of, printers, using, jokes, and, cartoons, as, page, fillers, was, also, widely, used, in, the, broadsides, and, chapbooks, of, the, 19th, century, and, earlier, with, the, increase, in, literacy, in, the, general, population, and, the, growth, of, the, printing, industry, these, publications, were, the, most, common, forms, of, printed, material, between, the, 16th, and, 19th, centuries, throughout, europe, and, north, america, along, with, reports, of, events, executions, ballads, and, verse, they, also, contained, jokes, only, one, of, many, broadsides, archived, in, the, harvard, library, is, described, as, 1706, grinning, made, easy, or, funny, dick, s, unrivalled, collection, of, curious, comical, odd, droll, humorous, witty, whimsical, laughable, and, eccentric, jests, jokes, bulls, epigrams, c, with, many, other, descriptions, of, wit, and, humour, these, cheap, publications, ephemera, intended, for, mass, distribution, were, read, alone, read, aloud, posted, and, discarded, there, are, many, types, of, joke, books, in, print, today, a, search, on, the, internet, provides, a, plethora, of, titles, available, for, purchase, they, can, be, read, alone, for, solitary, entertainment, or, used, to, stock, up, on, new, jokes, to, entertain, friends, some, people, try, to, find, a, deeper, meaning, in, jokes, as, in, plato, and, a, platypus, walk, into, a, bar, understanding, philosophy, through, jokes, however, a, deeper, meaning, is, not, necessary, to, appreciate, their, inherent, entertainment, value, magazines, frequently, use, jokes, and, cartoons, as, filler, for, the, printed, page, reader, s, digest, closes, out, many, articles, with, an, unrelated, joke, at, the, bottom, of, the, article, the, new, yorker, was, first, published, in, 1925, with, the, stated, goal, of, being, a, sophisticated, humour, magazine, and, is, still, known, for, its, cartoons, telling, a, joke, is, a, cooperative, effort, it, requires, that, the, teller, and, the, audience, mutually, agree, in, one, form, or, another, to, understand, the, narrative, which, follows, as, a, joke, in, a, study, of, conversation, analysis, the, sociologist, harvey, sacks, describes, in, detail, the, sequential, organisation, in, the, telling, of, a, single, joke, this, telling, is, composed, as, for, stories, of, three, serially, ordered, and, adjacently, placed, types, of, sequences, the, preface, the, telling, and, the, response, sequences, folklorists, expand, this, to, include, the, context, of, the, joking, who, is, telling, what, jokes, to, whom, and, why, is, he, telling, them, when, the, context, of, the, joke, telling, in, turn, leads, into, a, study, of, joking, relationships, a, term, coined, by, anthropologists, to, refer, to, social, groups, within, a, culture, who, engage, in, institutionalised, banter, and, joking, framing, is, done, with, a, frequently, formulaic, expression, which, keys, the, audience, in, to, expect, a, joke, have, you, heard, the, one, reminds, me, of, a, joke, i, heard, so, a, lawyer, and, a, doctor, these, conversational, markers, are, just, a, few, examples, of, linguistic, frames, used, to, start, a, joke, regardless, of, the, frame, used, it, creates, a, social, space, and, clear, boundaries, around, the, narrative, which, follows, audience, response, to, this, initial, frame, can, be, acknowledgement, and, anticipation, of, the, joke, to, follow, it, can, also, be, a, dismissal, as, in, this, is, no, joking, matter, or, this, is, no, time, for, jokes, the, performance, frame, serves, to, label, joke, telling, as, a, culturally, marked, form, of, communication, both, the, performer, and, audience, understand, it, to, be, set, apart, from, the, real, world, an, elephant, walks, into, a, bar, a, person, sufficiently, familiar, with, both, the, english, language, and, the, way, jokes, are, told, automatically, understands, that, such, a, compressed, and, formulaic, story, being, told, with, no, substantiating, details, and, placing, an, unlikely, combination, of, characters, into, an, unlikely, setting, and, involving, them, in, an, unrealistic, plot, is, the, start, of, a, joke, and, the, story, that, follows, is, not, meant, to, be, taken, at, face, value, i, e, it, is, non, bona, fide, communication, the, framing, itself, invokes, a, play, mode, if, the, audience, is, unable, or, unwilling, to, move, into, play, then, nothing, will, seem, funny, following, its, linguistic, framing, the, joke, in, the, form, of, a, story, can, be, told, it, is, not, required, to, be, verbatim, text, like, other, forms, of, oral, literature, such, as, riddles, and, proverbs, the, teller, can, and, does, modify, the, text, of, the, joke, depending, both, on, memory, and, the, present, audience, the, important, characteristic, is, that, the, narrative, is, succinct, containing, only, those, details, which, lead, directly, to, an, understanding, and, decoding, of, the, punchline, this, requires, that, it, support, the, same, or, similar, divergent, scripts, which, are, to, be, embodied, in, the, punchline, the, narrative, always, contains, a, protagonist, who, becomes, the, butt, or, target, of, the, joke, this, labelling, serves, to, develop, and, solidify, stereotypes, within, the, culture, it, also, enables, researchers, to, group, and, analyse, the, creation, persistence, and, interpretation, of, joke, cycles, around, a, certain, character, some, people, are, naturally, better, performers, than, others, however, anyone, can, tell, a, joke, because, the, comic, trigger, is, contained, in, the, narrative, text, and, punchline, a, joke, poorly, told, is, still, funny, unless, errors, or, omissions, make, the, intended, relationship, between, the, narrative, and, the, punchline, unintelligible, the, punchline, is, intended, to, make, the, audience, laugh, a, linguistic, interpretation, of, this, punchline, response, is, elucidated, by, victor, raskin, in, his, script, based, semantic, theory, of, humour, humour, is, evoked, when, a, trigger, contained, in, the, punchline, causes, the, audience, to, abruptly, shift, its, understanding, of, the, story, from, the, primary, or, more, obvious, interpretation, to, a, secondary, opposing, interpretation, the, punchline, is, the, pivot, on, which, the, joke, text, turns, as, it, signals, the, shift, between, the, scripts, necessary, to, interpret, the, joke, text, to, produce, the, humour, in, the, verbal, joke, the, two, interpretations, i, e, scripts, need, to, both, be, compatible, with, the, joke, text, and, opposite, or, incompatible, with, each, other, thomas, r, shultz, a, psychologist, independently, expands, raskin, s, linguistic, theory, to, include, two, stages, of, incongruity, perception, and, resolution, he, explains, that, incongruity, alone, is, insufficient, to, account, for, the, structure, of, humour, within, this, framework, humour, appreciation, is, conceptualized, as, a, biphasic, sequence, involving, first, the, discovery, of, incongruity, followed, by, a, resolution, of, the, incongruity, in, the, case, of, a, joke, that, resolution, generates, laughter, this, is, the, point, at, which, the, field, of, neurolinguistics, offers, some, insight, into, the, cognitive, processing, involved, in, this, abrupt, laughter, at, the, punchline, studies, by, the, cognitive, science, researchers, coulson, and, kutas, directly, address, the, theory, of, script, switching, articulated, by, raskin, in, their, work, the, article, getting, it, human, event, related, brain, response, to, jokes, in, good, and, poor, comprehenders, measures, brain, activity, in, response, to, reading, jokes, additional, studies, by, others, in, the, field, support, more, generally, the, theory, of, two, stage, processing, of, humour, as, evidenced, in, the, longer, processing, time, they, require, in, the, related, field, of, neuroscience, it, has, been, shown, that, the, expression, of, laughter, is, caused, by, two, partially, independent, neuronal, pathways, an, involuntary, or, emotionally, driven, system, and, a, voluntary, system, this, study, adds, credence, to, the, common, experience, when, exposed, to, an, off, colour, joke, a, laugh, is, followed, in, the, next, breath, by, a, disclaimer, oh, that, s, bad, here, the, multiple, steps, in, cognition, are, clearly, evident, in, the, stepped, response, the, perception, being, processed, just, a, breath, faster, than, the, resolution, of, the, moral, ethical, content, in, the, joke, expected, response, to, a, joke, is, laughter, the, joke, teller, hopes, the, audience, gets, it, and, is, entertained, this, leads, to, the, premise, that, a, joke, is, actually, an, understanding, test, between, individuals, and, groups, if, the, listeners, do, not, get, the, joke, they, are, not, understanding, the, two, scripts, which, are, contained, in, the, narrative, as, they, were, intended, or, they, do, get, it, and, do, not, laugh, it, might, be, too, obscene, too, gross, or, too, dumb, for, the, current, audience, a, woman, might, respond, differently, to, a, joke, told, by, a, male, colleague, around, the, water, cooler, than, she, would, to, the, same, joke, overheard, in, a, women, s, lavatory, a, joke, involving, toilet, humour, may, be, funnier, told, on, the, playground, at, elementary, school, than, on, a, college, campus, the, same, joke, will, elicit, different, responses, in, different, settings, the, punchline, in, the, joke, remains, the, same, however, it, is, more, or, less, appropriate, depending, on, the, current, context, the, context, explores, the, specific, social, situation, in, which, joking, occurs, the, narrator, automatically, modifies, the, text, of, the, joke, to, be, acceptable, to, different, audiences, while, at, the, same, time, supporting, the, same, divergent, scripts, in, the, punchline, the, vocabulary, used, in, telling, the, same, joke, at, a, university, fraternity, party, and, to, one, s, grandmother, might, well, vary, in, each, situation, it, is, important, to, identify, both, the, narrator, and, the, audience, as, well, as, their, relationship, with, each, other, this, varies, to, reflect, the, complexities, of, a, matrix, of, different, social, factors, age, sex, race, ethnicity, kinship, political, views, religion, power, relationships, etc, when, all, the, potential, combinations, of, such, factors, between, the, narrator, and, the, audience, are, considered, then, a, single, joke, can, take, on, infinite, shades, of, meaning, for, each, unique, social, setting, the, context, however, should, not, be, confused, with, the, function, of, the, joking, function, is, essentially, an, abstraction, made, on, the, basis, of, a, number, of, contexts, in, one, long, term, observation, of, men, coming, off, the, late, shift, at, a, local, caf, joking, with, the, waitresses, was, used, to, ascertain, sexual, availability, for, the, evening, different, types, of, jokes, going, from, general, to, topical, into, explicitly, sexual, humour, signalled, openness, on, the, part, of, the, waitress, for, a, connection, this, study, describes, how, jokes, and, joking, are, used, to, communicate, much, more, than, just, good, humour, that, is, a, single, example, of, the, function, of, joking, in, a, social, setting, but, there, are, others, sometimes, jokes, are, used, simply, to, get, to, know, someone, better, what, makes, them, laugh, what, do, they, find, funny, jokes, concerning, politics, religion, or, sexual, topics, can, be, used, effectively, to, gauge, the, attitude, of, the, audience, to, any, one, of, these, topics, they, can, also, be, used, as, a, marker, of, group, identity, signalling, either, inclusion, or, exclusion, for, the, group, among, pre, adolescents, dirty, jokes, allow, them, to, share, information, about, their, changing, bodies, and, sometimes, joking, is, just, simple, entertainment, for, a, group, of, friends, the, context, of, joking, in, turn, leads, to, a, study, of, joking, relationships, a, term, coined, by, anthropologists, to, refer, to, social, groups, within, a, culture, who, take, part, in, institutionalised, banter, and, joking, these, relationships, can, be, either, one, way, or, a, mutual, back, and, forth, between, partners, the, joking, relationship, is, defined, as, a, peculiar, combination, of, friendliness, and, antagonism, the, behaviour, is, such, that, in, any, other, social, context, it, would, express, and, arouse, hostility, but, it, is, not, meant, seriously, and, must, not, be, taken, seriously, there, is, a, pretence, of, hostility, along, with, a, real, friendliness, to, put, it, in, another, way, the, relationship, is, one, of, permitted, disrespect, joking, relationships, were, first, described, by, anthropologists, within, kinship, groups, in, africa, but, they, have, since, been, identified, in, cultures, around, the, world, where, jokes, and, joking, are, used, to, mark, and, reinforce, appropriate, boundaries, of, a, relationship, the, advent, of, electronic, communications, at, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, introduced, new, traditions, into, jokes, a, verbal, joke, or, cartoon, is, emailed, to, a, friend, or, posted, on, a, bulletin, board, reactions, include, a, replied, email, with, a, or, lol, or, a, forward, on, to, further, recipients, interaction, is, limited, to, the, computer, screen, and, for, the, most, part, solitary, while, preserving, the, text, of, a, joke, both, context, and, variants, are, lost, in, internet, joking, for, the, most, part, emailed, jokes, are, passed, along, verbatim, the, framing, of, the, joke, frequently, occurs, in, the, subject, line, re, laugh, for, the, day, or, something, similar, the, forward, of, an, email, joke, can, increase, the, number, of, recipients, exponentially, internet, joking, forces, a, re, evaluation, of, social, spaces, and, social, groups, they, are, no, longer, only, defined, by, physical, presence, and, locality, they, also, exist, in, the, connectivity, in, cyberspace, the, computer, networks, appear, to, make, possible, communities, that, although, physically, dispersed, display, attributes, of, the, direct, unconstrained, unofficial, exchanges, folklorists, typically, concern, themselves, with, this, is, particularly, evident, in, the, spread, of, topical, jokes, that, genre, of, lore, in, which, whole, crops, of, jokes, spring, up, seemingly, overnight, around, some, sensational, event, flourish, briefly, and, then, disappear, as, the, mass, media, move, on, to, fresh, maimings, and, new, collective, tragedies, this, correlates, with, the, new, understanding, of, the, internet, as, an, active, folkloric, space, with, evolving, social, and, cultural, forces, and, clearly, identifiable, performers, and, audiences, a, study, by, the, folklorist, bill, ellis, documented, how, an, evolving, cycle, was, circulated, over, the, internet, by, accessing, message, boards, that, specialised, in, humour, immediately, following, the, 9, 11, disaster, ellis, was, able, to, observe, in, real, time, both, the, topical, jokes, being, posted, electronically, and, responses, to, the, jokes, previous, folklore, research, has, been, limited, to, collecting, and, documenting, successful, jokes, and, only, after, they, had, emerged, and, come, to, folklorists, attention, now, an, internet, enhanced, collection, creates, a, time, machine, as, it, were, where, we, can, observe, what, happens, in, the, period, before, the, risible, moment, when, attempts, at, humour, are, unsuccessful, access, to, archived, message, boards, also, enables, us, to, track, the, development, of, a, single, joke, thread, in, the, context, of, a, more, complicated, virtual, conversation, a, joke, cycle, is, a, collection, of, jokes, about, a, single, target, or, situation, which, displays, consistent, narrative, structure, and, type, of, humour, some, well, known, cycles, are, elephant, jokes, using, nonsense, humour, dead, baby, jokes, incorporating, black, humour, and, light, bulb, jokes, which, describe, all, kinds, of, operational, stupidity, joke, cycles, can, centre, on, ethnic, groups, professions, viola, jokes, catastrophes, settings, walks, into, a, bar, absurd, characters, wind, up, dolls, or, logical, mechanisms, which, generate, the, humour, knock, knock, jokes, a, joke, can, be, reused, in, different, joke, cycles, an, example, of, this, is, the, same, head, shoulders, joke, refitted, to, the, tragedies, of, vic, morrow, admiral, mountbatten, and, the, crew, of, the, challenger, space, shuttle, these, cycles, seem, to, appear, spontaneously, spread, rapidly, across, countries, and, borders, only, to, dissipate, after, some, time, folklorists, and, others, have, studied, individual, joke, cycles, in, an, attempt, to, understand, their, function, and, significance, within, the, culture, joke, cycles, circulated, in, the, recent, past, include, as, with, the, 9, 11, disaster, discussed, above, cycles, attach, themselves, to, celebrities, or, national, catastrophes, such, as, the, death, of, diana, princess, of, wales, the, death, of, michael, jackson, and, the, space, shuttle, challenger, disaster, these, cycles, arise, regularly, as, a, response, to, terrible, unexpected, events, which, command, the, national, news, an, in, depth, analysis, of, the, challenger, joke, cycle, documents, a, change, in, the, type, of, humour, circulated, following, the, disaster, from, february, to, march, 1986, it, shows, that, the, jokes, appeared, in, distinct, waves, the, first, responding, to, the, disaster, with, clever, wordplay, and, the, second, playing, with, grim, and, troubling, images, associated, with, the, event, the, primary, social, function, of, disaster, jokes, appears, to, be, to, provide, closure, to, an, event, that, provoked, communal, grieving, by, signalling, that, it, was, time, to, move, on, and, pay, attention, to, more, immediate, concerns, the, sociologist, christie, davies, has, written, extensively, on, ethnic, jokes, told, in, countries, around, the, world, in, ethnic, jokes, he, finds, that, the, stupid, ethnic, target, in, the, joke, is, no, stranger, to, the, culture, but, rather, a, peripheral, social, group, geographic, economic, cultural, linguistic, well, known, to, the, joke, tellers, so, americans, tell, jokes, about, polacks, and, italians, germans, tell, jokes, about, ostfriesens, and, the, english, tell, jokes, about, the, irish, in, a, review, of, davies, theories, it, is, said, that, for, davies, jokes, are, more, about, how, joke, tellers, imagine, themselves, than, about, how, they, imagine, those, others, who, serve, as, their, putative, targets, the, jokes, thus, serve, to, center, one, in, the, world, to, remind, people, of, their, place, and, to, reassure, them, that, they, are, in, it, a, third, category, of, joke, cycles, identifies, absurd, characters, as, the, butt, for, example, the, grape, the, dead, baby, or, the, elephant, beginning, in, the, 1960s, social, and, cultural, interpretations, of, these, joke, cycles, spearheaded, by, the, folklorist, alan, dundes, began, to, appear, in, academic, journals, dead, baby, jokes, are, posited, to, reflect, societal, changes, and, guilt, caused, by, widespread, use, of, contraception, and, abortion, beginning, in, the, 1960s, elephant, jokes, have, been, interpreted, variously, as, stand, ins, for, american, blacks, during, the, civil, rights, era, or, as, an, image, of, something, large, and, wild, abroad, in, the, land, captur, the, sense, of, counterculture, of, the, sixties, these, interpretations, strive, for, a, cultural, understanding, of, the, themes, of, these, jokes, which, go, beyond, the, simple, collection, and, documentation, undertaken, previously, by, folklorists, and, ethnologists, as, folktales, and, other, types, of, oral, literature, became, collectables, throughout, europe, in, the, 19th, century, brothers, grimm, et, al, folklorists, and, anthropologists, of, the, time, needed, a, system, to, organise, these, items, the, aarne, thompson, classification, system, was, first, published, in, 1910, by, antti, aarne, and, later, expanded, by, stith, thompson, to, become, the, most, renowned, classification, system, for, european, folktales, and, other, types, of, oral, literature, its, final, section, addresses, anecdotes, and, jokes, listing, traditional, humorous, tales, ordered, by, their, protagonist, this, section, of, the, index, is, essentially, a, classification, of, the, older, european, jests, or, merry, tales, humorous, stories, characterized, by, short, fairly, simple, plots, due, to, its, focus, on, older, tale, types, and, obsolete, actors, e, g, numbskull, the, aarne, thompson, index, does, not, provide, much, help, in, identifying, and, classifying, the, modern, joke, a, more, granular, classification, system, used, widely, by, folklorists, and, cultural, anthropologists, is, the, thompson, motif, index, which, separates, tales, into, their, individual, story, elements, this, system, enables, jokes, to, be, classified, according, to, individual, motifs, included, in, the, narrative, actors, items, and, incidents, it, does, not, provide, a, system, to, classify, the, text, by, more, than, one, element, at, a, time, while, at, the, same, time, making, it, theoretically, possible, to, classify, the, same, text, under, multiple, motifs, the, thompson, motif, index, has, spawned, further, specialised, motif, indices, each, of, which, focuses, on, a, single, aspect, of, one, subset, of, jokes, a, sampling, of, just, a, few, of, these, specialised, indices, have, been, listed, under, other, motif, indices, here, one, can, select, an, index, for, medieval, spanish, folk, narratives, another, index, for, linguistic, verbal, jokes, and, a, third, one, for, sexual, humour, to, assist, the, researcher, with, this, increasingly, confusing, situation, there, are, also, multiple, bibliographies, of, indices, as, well, as, a, how, to, guide, on, creating, your, own, index, several, difficulties, have, been, identified, with, these, systems, of, identifying, oral, narratives, according, to, either, tale, types, or, story, elements, a, first, major, problem, is, their, hierarchical, organisation, one, element, of, the, narrative, is, selected, as, the, major, element, while, all, other, parts, are, arrayed, subordinate, to, this, a, second, problem, with, these, systems, is, that, the, listed, motifs, are, not, qualitatively, equal, actors, items, and, incidents, are, all, considered, side, by, side, and, because, incidents, will, always, have, at, least, one, actor, and, usually, have, an, item, most, narratives, can, be, ordered, under, multiple, headings, this, leads, to, confusion, about, both, where, to, order, an, item, and, where, to, find, it, a, third, significant, problem, is, that, the, excessive, prudery, common, in, the, middle, of, the, 20th, century, means, that, obscene, sexual, and, scatological, elements, were, regularly, ignored, in, many, of, the, indices, the, folklorist, robert, georges, has, summed, up, the, concerns, with, these, existing, classification, systems, yet, what, the, multiplicity, and, variety, of, sets, and, subsets, reveal, is, that, folklore, not, only, takes, many, forms, but, that, it, is, also, multifaceted, with, purpose, use, structure, content, style, and, function, all, being, relevant, and, important, any, one, or, combination, of, these, multiple, and, varied, aspects, of, a, folklore, example, might, emerge, as, dominant, in, a, specific, situation, or, for, a, particular, inquiry, it, has, proven, difficult, to, organise, all, different, elements, of, a, joke, into, a, multi, dimensional, classification, system, which, could, be, of, real, value, in, the, study, and, evaluation, of, this, primarily, oral, complex, narrative, form, the, general, theory, of, verbal, humour, or, gtvh, developed, by, the, linguists, victor, raskin, and, salvatore, attardo, attempts, to, do, exactly, this, this, classification, system, was, developed, specifically, for, jokes, and, later, expanded, to, include, longer, types, of, humorous, narratives, six, different, aspects, of, the, narrative, labelled, knowledge, resources, or, krs, can, be, evaluated, largely, independently, of, each, other, and, then, combined, into, a, concatenated, classification, label, these, six, krs, of, the, joke, structure, include, as, development, of, the, gtvh, progressed, a, hierarchy, of, the, krs, was, established, to, partially, restrict, the, options, for, lower, level, krs, depending, on, the, krs, defined, above, them, for, example, a, lightbulb, joke, si, will, always, be, in, the, form, of, a, riddle, ns, outside, of, these, restrictions, the, krs, can, create, a, multitude, of, combinations, enabling, a, researcher, to, select, jokes, for, analysis, which, contain, only, one, or, two, defined, krs, it, also, allows, for, an, evaluation, of, the, similarity, or, dissimilarity, of, jokes, depending, on, the, similarity, of, their, labels, the, gtvh, presents, itself, as, a, mechanism, of, generating, an, infinite, number, of, jokes, by, combining, the, various, values, that, each, parameter, can, take, descriptively, to, analyze, a, joke, in, the, gtvh, consists, of, listing, the, values, of, the, 6, krs, with, the, caveat, that, ta, and, lm, may, be, empty, this, classification, system, provides, a, functional, multi, dimensional, label, for, any, joke, and, indeed, any, verbal, humour, many, academic, disciplines, lay, claim, to, the, study, of, jokes, and, other, forms, of, humour, as, within, their, purview, fortunately, there, are, enough, jokes, good, bad, and, worse, to, go, around, the, studies, of, jokes, from, each, of, the, interested, disciplines, bring, to, mind, the, tale, of, the, blind, men, and, an, elephant, where, the, observations, although, accurate, reflections, of, their, own, competent, methodological, inquiry, frequently, fail, to, grasp, the, beast, in, its, entirety, this, attests, to, the, joke, as, a, traditional, narrative, form, which, is, indeed, complex, concise, and, complete, in, and, of, itself, it, requires, a, multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and, cross, disciplinary, field, of, inquiry, to, truly, appreciate, these, nuggets, of, cultural, insight, sigmund, freud, was, one, of, the, first, modern, scholars, to, recognise, jokes, as, an, important, object, of, investigation, in, his, 1905, study, jokes, and, their, relation, to, the, unconscious, freud, describes, the, social, nature, of, humour, and, illustrates, his, text, with, many, examples, of, contemporary, viennese, jokes, his, work, is, particularly, noteworthy, in, this, context, because, freud, distinguishes, in, his, writings, between, jokes, humour, and, the, comic, these, are, distinctions, which, become, easily, blurred, in, many, subsequent, studies, where, everything, funny, tends, to, be, gathered, under, the, umbrella, term, of, humour, making, for, a, much, more, diffuse, discussion, since, the, publication, of, freud, s, study, psychologists, have, continued, to, explore, humour, and, jokes, in, their, quest, to, explain, predict, and, control, an, individual, s, sense, of, humour, why, do, people, laugh, why, do, people, find, something, funny, can, jokes, predict, character, or, vice, versa, can, character, predict, the, jokes, an, individual, laughs, at, what, is, a, sense, of, humour, a, current, review, of, the, popular, magazine, psychology, today, lists, over, 200, articles, discussing, various, aspects, of, humour, in, psychological, jargon, the, subject, area, has, become, both, an, emotion, to, measure, and, a, tool, to, use, in, diagnostics, and, treatment, a, new, psychological, assessment, tool, the, values, in, action, inventory, developed, by, the, american, psychologists, christopher, peterson, and, martin, seligman, includes, humour, and, playfulness, as, one, of, the, core, character, strengths, of, an, individual, as, such, it, could, be, a, good, predictor, of, life, satisfaction, for, psychologists, it, would, be, useful, to, measure, both, how, much, of, this, strength, an, individual, has, and, how, it, can, be, measurably, increased, a, 2007, survey, of, existing, tools, to, measure, humour, identified, more, than, 60, psychological, measurement, instruments, these, measurement, tools, use, many, different, approaches, to, quantify, humour, along, with, its, related, states, and, traits, there, are, tools, to, measure, an, individual, s, physical, response, by, their, smile, the, facial, action, coding, system, facs, is, one, of, several, tools, used, to, identify, any, one, of, multiple, types, of, smiles, or, the, laugh, can, be, measured, to, calculate, the, funniness, response, of, an, individual, multiple, types, of, laughter, have, been, identified, it, must, be, stressed, here, that, both, smiles, and, laughter, are, not, always, a, response, to, something, funny, in, trying, to, develop, a, measurement, tool, most, systems, use, jokes, and, cartoons, as, their, test, materials, however, because, no, two, tools, use, the, same, jokes, and, across, languages, this, would, not, be, feasible, how, does, one, determine, that, the, assessment, objects, are, comparable, moving, on, whom, does, one, ask, to, rate, the, sense, of, humour, of, an, individual, does, one, ask, the, person, themselves, an, impartial, observer, or, their, family, friends, and, colleagues, furthermore, has, the, current, mood, of, the, test, subjects, been, considered, someone, with, a, recent, death, in, the, family, might, not, be, much, prone, to, laughter, given, the, plethora, of, variants, revealed, by, even, a, superficial, glance, at, the, problem, it, becomes, evident, that, these, paths, of, scientific, inquiry, are, mined, with, problematic, pitfalls, and, questionable, solutions, the, psychologist, willibald, ruch, has, been, very, active, in, the, research, of, humour, he, has, collaborated, with, the, linguists, raskin, and, attardo, on, their, general, theory, of, verbal, humour, gtvh, classification, system, their, goal, is, to, empirically, test, both, the, six, autonomous, classification, types, krs, and, the, hierarchical, ordering, of, these, krs, advancement, in, this, direction, would, be, a, win, win, for, both, fields, of, study, linguistics, would, have, empirical, verification, of, this, multi, dimensional, classification, system, for, jokes, and, psychology, would, have, a, standardised, joke, classification, with, which, they, could, develop, verifiably, comparable, measurement, tools, the, linguistics, of, humor, has, made, gigantic, strides, forward, in, the, last, decade, and, a, half, and, replaced, the, psychology, of, humor, as, the, most, advanced, theoretical, approach, to, the, study, of, this, important, and, universal, human, faculty, this, recent, statement, by, one, noted, linguist, and, humour, researcher, describes, from, his, perspective, contemporary, linguistic, humour, research, linguists, study, words, how, words, are, strung, together, to, build, sentences, how, sentences, create, meaning, which, can, be, communicated, from, one, individual, to, another, and, how, our, interaction, with, each, other, using, words, creates, discourse, jokes, have, been, defined, above, as, oral, narratives, in, which, words, and, sentences, are, engineered, to, build, toward, a, punchline, the, linguist, s, question, is, what, exactly, makes, the, punchline, funny, this, question, focuses, on, how, the, words, used, in, the, punchline, create, humour, in, contrast, to, the, psychologist, s, concern, see, above, with, the, audience, s, response, to, the, punchline, the, assessment, of, humour, by, psychologists, is, made, from, the, individual, s, perspective, e, g, the, phenomenon, associated, with, responding, to, or, creating, humor, and, not, a, description, of, humor, itself, linguistics, on, the, other, hand, endeavours, to, provide, a, precise, description, of, what, makes, a, text, funny, two, major, new, linguistic, theories, have, been, developed, and, tested, within, the, last, decades, the, first, was, advanced, by, victor, raskin, in, semantic, mechanisms, of, humor, published, 1985, while, being, a, variant, on, the, more, general, concepts, of, the, incongruity, theory, of, humour, it, is, the, first, theory, to, identify, its, approach, as, exclusively, linguistic, the, script, based, semantic, theory, of, humour, ssth, begins, by, identifying, two, linguistic, conditions, which, make, a, text, funny, it, then, goes, on, to, identify, the, mechanisms, involved, in, creating, the, punchline, this, theory, established, the, semantic, pragmatic, foundation, of, humour, as, well, as, the, humour, competence, of, speakers, several, years, later, the, ssth, was, incorporated, into, a, more, expansive, theory, of, jokes, put, forth, by, raskin, and, his, colleague, salvatore, attardo, in, the, general, theory, of, verbal, humour, the, ssth, was, relabelled, as, a, logical, mechanism, lm, referring, to, the, mechanism, which, connects, the, different, linguistic, scripts, in, the, joke, and, added, to, five, other, independent, knowledge, resources, kr, together, these, six, krs, could, now, function, as, a, multi, dimensional, descriptive, label, for, any, piece, of, humorous, text, linguistics, has, developed, further, methodological, tools, which, can, be, applied, to, jokes, discourse, analysis, and, conversation, analysis, of, joking, both, of, these, subspecialties, within, the, field, focus, on, naturally, occurring, language, use, i, e, the, analysis, of, real, usually, recorded, conversations, one, of, these, studies, has, already, been, discussed, above, where, harvey, sacks, describes, in, detail, the, sequential, organisation, in, telling, a, single, joke, discourse, analysis, emphasises, the, entire, context, of, social, joking, the, social, interaction, which, cradles, the, words, folklore, and, cultural, anthropology, have, perhaps, the, strongest, claims, on, jokes, as, belonging, to, their, bailiwick, jokes, remain, one, of, the, few, remaining, forms, of, traditional, folk, literature, transmitted, orally, in, western, cultures, identified, as, one, of, the, simple, forms, of, oral, literature, by, andr, jolles, in, 1930, they, have, been, collected, and, studied, since, there, were, folklorists, and, anthropologists, abroad, in, the, lands, as, a, genre, they, were, important, enough, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, to, be, included, under, their, own, heading, in, the, aarne, thompson, index, first, published, in, 1910, anecdotes, and, jokes, beginning, in, the, 1960s, cultural, researchers, began, to, expand, their, role, from, collectors, and, archivists, of, folk, ideas, to, a, more, active, role, of, interpreters, of, cultural, artefacts, one, of, the, foremost, scholars, active, during, this, transitional, time, was, the, folklorist, alan, dundes, he, started, asking, questions, of, tradition, and, transmission, with, the, key, observation, that, no, piece, of, folklore, continues, to, be, transmitted, unless, it, means, something, even, if, neither, the, speaker, nor, the, audience, can, articulate, what, that, meaning, might, be, in, the, context, of, jokes, this, then, becomes, the, basis, for, further, research, why, is, the, joke, told, right, now, only, in, this, expanded, perspective, is, an, understanding, of, its, meaning, to, the, participants, possible, this, questioning, resulted, in, a, blossoming, of, monographs, to, explore, the, significance, of, many, joke, cycles, what, is, so, funny, about, absurd, nonsense, elephant, jokes, why, make, light, of, dead, babies, in, an, article, on, contemporary, german, jokes, about, auschwitz, and, the, holocaust, dundes, justifies, this, research, whether, one, finds, auschwitz, jokes, funny, or, not, is, not, an, issue, this, material, exists, and, should, be, recorded, jokes, are, always, an, important, barometer, of, the, attitudes, of, a, group, the, jokes, exist, and, they, obviously, must, fill, some, psychic, need, for, those, individuals, who, tell, them, and, those, who, listen, to, them, a, stimulating, generation, of, new, humour, theories, flourishes, like, mushrooms, in, the, undergrowth, elliott, oring, s, theoretical, discussions, on, appropriate, ambiguity, and, amy, carrell, s, hypothesis, of, an, audience, based, theory, of, verbal, humor, 1993, to, name, just, a, few, in, his, book, humor, and, laughter, an, anthropological, approach, the, anthropologist, mahadev, apte, presents, a, solid, case, for, his, own, academic, perspective, two, axioms, underlie, my, discussion, namely, that, humor, is, by, and, large, culture, based, and, that, humor, can, be, a, major, conceptual, and, methodological, tool, for, gaining, insights, into, cultural, systems, apte, goes, on, to, call, for, legitimising, the, field, of, humour, research, as, humorology, this, would, be, a, field, of, study, incorporating, an, interdisciplinary, character, of, humour, studies, while, the, label, humorology, has, yet, to, become, a, household, word, great, strides, are, being, made, in, the, international, recognition, of, this, interdisciplinary, field, of, research, the, international, society, for, humor, studies, was, founded, in, 1989, with, the, stated, purpose, to, promote, stimulate, and, encourage, the, interdisciplinary, study, of, humour, to, support, and, cooperate, with, local, national, and, international, organizations, having, similar, purposes, to, organize, and, arrange, meetings, and, to, issue, and, encourage, publications, concerning, the, purpose, of, the, society, it, also, publishes, humor, international, journal, of, humor, research, and, holds, yearly, conferences, to, promote, and, inform, its, speciality, in, 1872, charles, darwin, published, one, of, the, first, comprehensive, and, in, many, ways, remarkably, accurate, description, of, laughter, in, terms, of, respiration, vocalization, facial, action, and, gesture, and, posture, laughter, in, this, early, study, darwin, raises, further, questions, about, who, laughs, and, why, they, laugh, the, myriad, responses, since, then, illustrate, the, complexities, of, this, behaviour, to, understand, laughter, in, humans, and, other, primates, the, science, of, gelotology, from, the, greek, gelos, meaning, laughter, has, been, established, it, is, the, study, of, laughter, and, its, effects, on, the, body, from, both, a, psychological, and, physiological, perspective, while, jokes, can, provoke, laughter, laughter, cannot, be, used, as, a, one, to, one, marker, of, jokes, because, there, are, multiple, stimuli, to, laughter, humour, being, just, one, of, them, the, other, six, causes, of, laughter, listed, are, social, context, ignorance, anxiety, derision, acting, apology, and, tickling, as, such, the, study, of, laughter, is, a, secondary, albeit, entertaining, perspective, in, an, understanding, of, jokes, computational, humour, is, a, new, field, of, study, which, uses, computers, to, model, humour, it, bridges, the, disciplines, of, computational, linguistics, and, artificial, intelligence, a, primary, ambition, of, this, field, is, to, develop, computer, programs, which, can, both, generate, a, joke, and, recognise, a, text, snippet, as, a, joke, early, programming, attempts, have, dealt, almost, exclusively, with, punning, because, this, lends, itself, to, simple, straightforward, rules, these, primitive, programs, display, no, intelligence, instead, they, work, off, a, template, with, a, finite, set, of, pre, defined, punning, options, upon, which, to, build, more, sophisticated, computer, joke, programs, have, yet, to, be, developed, based, on, our, understanding, of, the, ssth, gtvh, humour, theories, it, is, easy, to, see, why, the, linguistic, scripts, a, k, a, frames, referenced, in, these, theories, include, for, any, given, word, a, large, chunk, of, semantic, information, surrounding, the, word, and, evoked, by, it, a, cognitive, structure, internalized, by, the, native, speaker, these, scripts, extend, much, further, than, the, lexical, definition, of, a, word, they, contain, the, speaker, s, complete, knowledge, of, the, concept, as, it, exists, in, his, world, as, insentient, machines, computers, lack, the, encyclopaedic, scripts, which, humans, gain, through, life, experience, they, also, lack, the, ability, to, gather, the, experiences, needed, to, build, wide, ranging, semantic, scripts, and, understand, language, in, a, broader, context, a, context, that, any, child, picks, up, in, daily, interaction, with, his, environment, further, development, in, this, field, must, wait, until, computational, linguists, have, succeeded, in, programming, a, computer, with, an, ontological, semantic, natural, language, processing, system, it, is, only, the, most, complex, linguistic, structures, can, serve, any, formal, and, or, computational, treatment, of, humor, well, toy, systems, i, e, dummy, punning, programs, are, completely, inadequate, to, the, task, despite, the, fact, that, the, field, of, computational, humour, is, small, and, underdeveloped, it, is, encouraging, to, note, the, many, interdisciplinary, efforts, which, are, currently, underway, as, this, field, grows, in, both, understanding, and, methodology, it, provides, an, ideal, testbed, for, humour, theories, the, rules, must, firstly, be, clearly, defined, in, order, to, write, a, computer, program, around, a, theory, 1, july, is, celebrated, around, the, world, as, international, joke, day
