term, aria, which, derives, from, the, greek, and, latin, aer, air, first, appeared, in, relation, to, music, in, the, 14th, century, when, it, simply, signified, a, manner, or, style, of, singing, or, playing, by, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, the, term, aria, refers, to, an, instrumental, form, cf, santino, garsi, da, parma, lute, works, aria, del, gran, duca, by, the, early, 16th, century, it, was, in, common, use, as, meaning, a, simple, setting, of, strophic, poetry, melodic, madrigals, free, of, complex, polyphony, were, known, as, madrigale, arioso, in, the, context, of, staged, works, and, concert, works, arias, evolved, from, simple, melodies, into, structured, forms, in, such, works, the, sung, melodic, and, structured, aria, differed, from, the, speech, like, parlando, recitative, the, latter, tending, to, carry, the, story, line, the, former, used, to, convey, emotional, content, and, serve, as, an, opportunity, for, singers, to, display, their, vocal, talent, by, the, late, 17th, century, operatic, arias, came, to, be, written, in, one, of, two, forms, binary, form, arias, were, in, two, sections, a, b, arias, in, ternary, form, a, b, a, were, known, as, da, capo, arias, literally, from, the, head, i, e, with, the, opening, section, repeated, often, in, a, highly, decorated, manner, in, the, da, capo, aria, the, b, episode, would, typically, be, in, a, different, key, the, dominant, or, relative, major, key, other, variants, of, these, forms, are, found, in, the, french, operas, of, the, late, 17th, century, such, as, those, of, jean, baptiste, lully, which, dominated, the, period, of, the, french, baroque, vocal, solos, in, his, operas, known, of, course, as, the, french, term, airs, are, frequently, in, extended, binary, form, abb, or, sometimes, in, rondeau, form, abaca, a, shape, which, is, analogous, to, the, instrumental, rondo, in, the, work, of, italian, composers, of, the, late, 17th, and, early, 18th, century, the, da, capo, aria, came, to, be, include, the, ritornello, literally, little, return, a, recurring, instrumental, episode, which, featured, certain, phrases, of, the, aria, proper, and, provided, in, early, operas, the, opportunity, for, dancing, or, entries, of, characters, da, capo, aria, with, ritornelli, became, a, typifying, feature, of, european, opera, throughout, the, 18th, century, and, is, thought, by, some, writers, to, be, a, direct, antecedent, of, sonata, form, the, ritornelli, became, essential, to, the, structure, of, the, aria, while, the, words, determine, the, character, of, a, melody, the, ritornello, instruments, often, decided, in, what, terms, it, shall, be, presented, by, the, early, 18th, century, composers, such, as, alessandro, scarlatti, had, established, the, aria, form, and, especially, its, da, capo, version, with, ritornelli, as, the, key, element, of, opera, seria, it, offered, balance, and, continuity, and, yet, gave, scope, for, contrast, the, very, regularity, of, its, conventional, features, enabled, deviations, from, the, normal, to, be, exploited, with, telling, effect, in, the, early, years, of, the, century, arias, in, the, italian, style, began, to, take, over, in, french, opera, giving, rise, eventually, to, the, french, genre, of, ariette, normally, in, a, relatively, simple, ternary, form, types, of, operatic, aria, became, known, by, a, variety, of, terms, according, to, their, character, e, g, aria, parlante, speaking, style, narrative, in, nature, aria, di, bravura, typically, given, to, a, heroine, aria, buffa, aria, of, a, comic, type, typically, given, to, a, bass, or, bass, baritone, and, so, on, m, f, robinson, describes, the, standard, aria, in, opera, seria, in, the, period, 1720, to, 1760, as, follows, the, first, section, normally, began, with, an, orchestral, ritornello, after, which, the, singer, entered, and, sang, the, words, of, the, first, stanza, in, their, entirety, by, the, end, of, this, first, vocal, paragraph, the, music, if, it, were, in, a, major, key, as, it, usually, was, had, modulated, to, the, dominant, the, orchestra, then, played, a, second, ritornello, usually, shorter, than, the, first, the, singer, re, entered, and, sang, the, same, words, through, a, second, time, the, music, of, this, second, paragraph, was, often, slightly, more, elaborate, than, that, of, the, first, there, were, more, repeats, of, words, and, perhaps, more, florid, vocalisations, the, key, worked, its, way, back, to, the, tonic, for, the, final, vocal, cadence, after, which, the, orchestra, rounded, the, section, off, with, a, final, ritornello, the, nature, and, allocation, of, the, arias, to, the, different, roles, in, opera, seria, was, highly, formalized, according, to, the, playwright, and, librettist, carlo, goldoni, in, his, autobiography, the, three, principal, personages, of, the, drama, ought, to, sing, five, arias, each, two, in, the, first, act, two, in, the, second, and, one, in, the, third, the, second, actress, and, the, second, soprano, can, only, have, three, and, the, inferior, characters, must, be, satisfied, with, a, single, aria, each, or, two, at, the, most, the, author, of, the, words, must, take, care, that, two, pathetic, arias, do, not, succeed, one, another, he, must, distribute, with, the, same, precaution, the, bravura, arias, the, arias, of, action, the, inferior, arias, and, the, minuets, and, rondeaus, he, must, above, all, things, avoid, giving, impassioned, arias, bravura, arias, or, rondeaus, to, inferior, characters, by, contrast, arias, in, opera, buffa, comic, opera, were, often, specific, in, character, to, the, nature, of, the, character, being, portrayed, for, example, the, cheeky, servant, girl, or, the, irascible, elderly, suitor, or, guardian, by, later, in, the, century, it, was, clear, that, these, formats, were, becoming, fossilized, christoph, willibald, gluck, thought, that, both, opera, buffa, and, opera, seria, had, strayed, too, far, from, what, opera, should, really, be, and, seemed, unnatural, the, jokes, of, opera, buffa, were, threadbare, and, the, repetition, of, the, same, characters, made, them, seem, no, more, than, stereotypes, in, opera, seria, the, singing, was, devoted, to, superficial, effects, and, the, content, was, uninteresting, and, stale, as, in, opera, buffa, the, singers, were, often, masters, of, the, stage, and, the, music, decorating, the, vocal, lines, so, floridly, that, audiences, could, no, longer, recognise, the, original, melody, gluck, wanted, to, return, opera, to, its, origins, focusing, on, human, drama, and, passions, and, making, words, and, music, of, equal, importance, the, effects, of, these, gluckist, reforms, were, seen, not, only, in, his, own, operas, but, in, the, later, works, of, mozart, the, arias, now, become, far, more, expressive, of, the, individual, emotions, of, the, characters, and, are, both, more, firmly, anchored, in, and, advance, the, storyline, richard, wagner, was, to, praise, gluck, s, innovations, in, his, 1850, essay, opera, and, drama, the, musical, composer, revolted, against, the, wilfulness, of, the, singer, rather, than, unfold, the, purely, sensuous, contents, of, the, aria, to, their, highest, rankest, pitch, gluck, sought, to, put, shackles, on, caprice, s, execution, of, that, aria, by, himself, endeavouring, to, give, the, tune, an, expression, answering, to, the, underlying, word, text, this, attitude, was, to, underlie, wagner, s, would, be, deconstruction, of, aria, in, his, concept, of, gesamtkunstwerk, despite, the, ideals, of, gluck, and, the, trend, to, organise, libretti, so, that, arias, had, a, more, organic, part, in, the, drama, rather, than, merely, interrupting, its, flow, in, the, operas, of, the, early, 19th, century, for, example, those, of, gioachino, rossini, and, gaetano, donizetti, bravura, arias, remained, focal, attractions, and, they, continued, to, play, a, major, role, in, grand, opera, and, in, italian, opera, through, the, 19th, century, a, favoured, form, of, aria, in, the, first, half, of, the, 19th, century, in, italian, opera, was, the, cabaletta, in, which, a, songlike, cantabile, section, is, followed, by, a, more, animated, section, the, cabaletta, proper, repeated, in, whole, or, in, part, typically, such, arias, would, be, preceded, by, recitative, the, whole, sequence, being, termed, a, scena, there, might, also, be, opportunities, for, participation, by, orchestra, or, chorus, an, example, is, casta, diva, from, the, opera, norma, of, vincenzo, bellini, after, around, 1850, aria, forms, in, italian, opera, began, to, show, more, variety, many, of, the, operas, of, giuseppe, verdi, offer, extended, narrative, arias, for, leading, roles, that, enable, in, their, scope, intensification, of, drama, and, characterisation, examples, include, rigoletto, s, condemnation, of, the, court, cortigiani, vil, razza, dannata, 1851, later, in, the, century, the, post, 1850, operas, of, wagner, were, through, composed, with, fewer, elements, being, readily, identifiable, as, self, contained, arias, whilst, the, italian, genre, of, verismo, opera, also, sought, to, integrate, arioso, elements, although, still, allowing, some, show, pieces, concert, arias, which, are, not, part, of, any, larger, work, or, were, sometimes, written, to, replace, or, insert, arias, in, their, own, operas, or, operas, of, other, composers, were, written, by, composers, to, provide, the, opportunity, for, vocal, display, for, concert, singers, examples, are, ah, perfido, op, 65, by, beethoven, and, a, number, of, concert, arias, by, mozart, including, conservati, fedele, the, term, aria, was, frequently, used, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, for, instrumental, music, modelled, on, vocal, music, for, example, j, s, bach, s, so, called, goldberg, variations, were, titled, at, their, 1741, publication, clavier, ubung, bestehend, in, einer, aria, mit, verschiedenen, ver, nderungen, keyboard, exercise, consisting,
