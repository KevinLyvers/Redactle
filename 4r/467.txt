tragedy, from, the, greek, trag, idia, is, a, genre, of, drama, based, on, human, suffering, and, mainly, the, terrible, or, sorrowful, events, that, befall, a, main, character, or, cast, of, characters, traditionally, the, intention, of, tragedy, is, to, invoke, an, accompanying, catharsis, or, a, pain, awakens, pleasure, for, the, audience, while, many, cultures, have, developed, forms, that, provoke, this, paradoxical, response, the, term, tragedy, often, refers, to, a, specific, tradition, of, drama, that, has, played, a, unique, and, important, role, historically, in, the, self, definition, of, western, civilization, that, tradition, has, been, multiple, and, discontinuous, yet, the, term, has, often, been, used, to, invoke, a, powerful, effect, of, cultural, identity, and, historical, continuity, the, greeks, and, the, elizabethans, in, one, cultural, form, hellenes, and, christians, in, a, common, activity, as, raymond, williams, puts, it, from, its, origins, in, the, theatre, of, ancient, greece, 2500, years, ago, from, which, there, survives, only, a, fraction, of, the, work, of, aeschylus, sophocles, and, euripides, as, well, as, many, fragments, from, other, poets, and, the, later, roman, tragedies, of, seneca, through, its, singular, articulations, in, the, works, of, shakespeare, lope, de, vega, jean, racine, and, friedrich, schiller, to, the, more, recent, naturalistic, tragedy, of, henrik, ibsen, and, august, strindberg, natyaguru, nurul, momen, s, nemesis, tragic, vengeance, samuel, beckett, s, modernist, meditations, on, death, loss, and, suffering, heiner, m, ller, postmodernist, reworkings, of, the, tragic, canon, tragedy, has, remained, an, important, site, of, cultural, experimentation, negotiation, struggle, and, change, a, long, line, of, philosophers, which, includes, plato, aristotle, saint, augustine, voltaire, hume, diderot, hegel, schopenhauer, kierkegaard, nietzsche, freud, benjamin, camus, lacan, and, deleuze, have, analysed, speculated, upon, and, criticised, the, genre, in, the, wake, of, aristotle, s, poetics, 335, bce, tragedy, has, been, used, to, make, genre, distinctions, whether, at, the, scale, of, poetry, in, general, where, the, tragic, divides, against, epic, and, lyric, or, at, the, scale, of, the, drama, where, tragedy, is, opposed, to, comedy, in, the, modern, era, tragedy, has, also, been, defined, against, drama, melodrama, the, tragicomic, and, epic, theatre, drama, in, the, narrow, sense, cuts, across, the, traditional, division, between, comedy, and, tragedy, in, an, anti, or, a, generic, deterritorialisation, from, the, mid, 19th, century, onwards, both, bertolt, brecht, and, augusto, boal, define, their, epic, theatre, projects, non, aristotelian, drama, and, theatre, of, the, oppressed, respectively, against, models, of, tragedy, taxidou, however, reads, epic, theatre, as, an, incorporation, of, tragic, functions, and, its, treatments, of, mourning, and, speculation, the, word, tragedy, appears, to, have, been, used, to, describe, different, phenomena, at, different, times, it, derives, from, classical, greek, contracted, from, trag, o, aoidi, goat, song, which, comes, from, tragos, he, goat, and, aeidein, to, sing, cf, ode, scholars, suspect, this, may, be, traced, to, a, time, when, a, goat, was, either, the, prize, in, a, competition, of, choral, dancing, or, was, what, a, chorus, danced, around, prior, to, the, animal, s, ritual, sacrifice, in, another, view, on, the, etymology, athenaeus, of, naucratis, 2nd, 3rd, century, ce, says, that, the, original, form, of, the, word, was, trygodia, from, trygos, grape, harvest, and, ode, song, because, those, events, were, first, introduced, during, grape, harvest, writing, in, 335, bce, long, after, the, golden, age, of, 5th, century, athenian, tragedy, aristotle, provides, the, earliest, surviving, explanation, for, the, origin, of, the, dramatic, art, form, in, his, poetics, in, which, he, argues, that, tragedy, developed, from, the, improvisations, of, the, leader, of, choral, dithyrambs, hymns, sung, and, danced, in, praise, of, dionysos, the, god, of, wine, and, fertility, anyway, arising, from, an, improvisatory, beginning, both, tragedy, and, comedy, tragedy, from, the, leaders, of, the, dithyramb, and, comedy, from, the, leaders, of, the, phallic, processions, which, even, now, continue, as, a, custom, in, many, of, our, cities, grew, little, by, little, as, developed, whatever, of, it, had, appeared, and, passing, through, many, changes, tragedy, came, to, a, halt, since, it, had, attained, its, own, nature, in, the, same, work, aristotle, attempts, to, provide, a, scholastic, definition, of, what, tragedy, is, tragedy, is, then, an, enactment, of, a, deed, that, is, important, and, complete, and, of, magnitude, by, means, of, language, enriched, each, used, separately, in, the, different, parts, it, is, enacted, not, recited, and, through, pity, and, fear, it, effects, relief, catharsis, to, such, emotions, there, is, some, dissent, to, the, dithyrambic, origins, of, tragedy, mostly, based, on, the, differences, between, the, shapes, of, their, choruses, and, styles, of, dancing, a, common, descent, from, pre, hellenic, fertility, and, burial, rites, has, been, suggested, friedrich, nietzsche, discussed, the, origins, of, greek, tragedy, in, his, early, book, the, birth, of, tragedy, 1872, here, he, suggests, the, name, originates, in, the, use, of, a, chorus, of, goat, like, satyrs, in, the, original, dithyrambs, from, which, the, tragic, genre, developed, scott, scullion, writes, there, is, abundant, evidence, for, tragoidia, understood, as, song, for, the, prize, goat, the, best, known, evidence, is, horace, ars, poetica, 220, 24, he, who, with, a, tragic, song, competed, for, a, mere, goat, the, earliest, is, the, parian, marble, a, chronicle, inscribed, about, 264, 63, bce, which, records, under, a, date, between, 538, and, 528, bce, thespis, is, the, poet, first, produced, and, as, prize, was, established, the, billy, goat, frghist, 239a, epoch, 43, the, clearest, is, eustathius, 1769, 45, they, called, those, competing, tragedians, clearly, because, of, the, song, over, the, billy, goat, athenian, tragedy, the, oldest, surviving, form, of, tragedy, is, a, type, of, dance, drama, that, formed, an, important, part, of, the, theatrical, culture, of, the, city, state, having, emerged, sometime, during, the, 6th, century, bce, it, flowered, during, the, 5th, century, bce, from, the, end, of, which, it, began, to, spread, throughout, the, greek, world, and, continued, to, be, popular, until, the, beginning, of, the, hellenistic, period, no, tragedies, from, the, 6th, century, and, only, 32, of, the, more, than, a, thousand, that, were, performed, in, the, 5th, century, have, survived, we, have, complete, texts, extant, by, aeschylus, sophocles, and, euripides, aeschylus, the, persians, is, recognized, to, be, the, earliest, extant, greek, tragedy, and, as, such, it, is, doubly, unique, among, the, extant, ancient, dramas, athenian, tragedies, were, performed, in, late, march, early, april, at, an, annual, state, religious, festival, in, honor, of, dionysus, the, presentations, took, the, form, of, a, contest, between, three, playwrights, who, presented, their, works, on, three, successive, days, each, playwright, offered, a, tetralogy, consisting, of, three, tragedies, and, a, concluding, comic, piece, called, a, satyr, play, the, four, plays, sometimes, featured, linked, stories, only, one, complete, trilogy, of, tragedies, has, survived, the, oresteia, of, aeschylus, the, greek, theatre, was, in, the, open, air, on, the, side, of, a, hill, and, performances, of, a, trilogy, and, satyr, play, probably, lasted, most, of, the, day, performances, were, apparently, open, to, all, citizens, including, women, but, evidence, is, scant, the, theatre, of, dionysus, at, athens, probably, held, around, 12, 000, people, all, of, the, choral, parts, were, sung, to, the, accompaniment, of, an, aulos, and, some, of, the, actors, answers, to, the, chorus, were, sung, as, well, the, play, as, a, whole, was, composed, in, various, verse, metres, all, actors, were, male, and, wore, masks, a, greek, chorus, danced, as, well, as, sang, though, no, one, knows, exactly, what, sorts, of, steps, the, chorus, performed, as, it, sang, choral, songs, in, tragedy, are, often, divided, into, three, sections, strophe, turning, circling, antistrophe, counter, turning, counter, circling, and, epode, after, song, many, ancient, greek, tragedians, employed, the, ekkykl, ma, as, a, theatrical, device, which, was, a, platform, hidden, behind, the, scene, that, could, be, rolled, out, to, display, the, aftermath, of, some, event, which, had, happened, out, of, sight, of, the, audience, this, event, was, frequently, a, brutal, murder, of, some, sort, an, act, of, violence, which, could, not, be, effectively, portrayed, visually, but, an, action, of, which, the, other, characters, must, see, the, effects, for, it, to, have, meaning, and, emotional, resonance, a, prime, example, of, the, use, of, the, ekkykl, ma, is, after, the, murder, of, agamemnon, in, the, first, play, of, aeschylus, oresteia, when, the, king, s, butchered, body, is, wheeled, out, in, a, grand, display, for, all, to, see, variations, on, the, ekkykl, ma, are, used, in, tragedies, and, other, forms, to, this, day, as, writers, still, find, it, a, useful, and, often, powerful, device, for, showing, the, consequences, of, extreme, human, actions, another, such, device, was, a, crane, the, mechane, which, served, to, hoist, a, god, or, goddess, on, stage, when, they, were, supposed, to, arrive, flying, this, device, gave, origin, to, the, phrase, deus, ex, machina, god, out, of, a, machine, that, is, the, surprise, intervention, of, an, unforeseen, external, factor, that, changes, the, outcome, of, an, event, following, the, expansion, of, the, roman, republic, 509, 27, bce, into, several, greek, territories, between, 270, and, 240, bce, rome, encountered, greek, tragedy, from, the, later, years, of, the, republic, and, by, means, of, the, roman, empire, 27, bce, 476, ce, theatre, spread, west, across, europe, around, the, mediterranean, and, even, reached, britain, while, greek, tragedy, continued, to, be, performed, throughout, the, roman, period, the, year, 240, bce, marks, the, beginning, of, regular, roman, drama, livius, andronicus, began, to, write, roman, tragedies, thus, creating, some, of, the, first, important, works, of, roman, literature, five, years, later, gnaeus, naevius, also, began, to, write, tragedies, though, he, was, more, appreciated, for, his, comedies, no, complete, early, roman, tragedy, survives, though, it, was, highly, regarded, in, its, day, historians, know, of, three, other, early, tragic, playwrights, quintus, ennius, marcus, pacuvius, and, lucius, accius, from, the, time, of, the, empire, the, tragedies, of, two, playwrights, survive, one, is, an, unknown, author, while, the, other, is, the, stoic, philosopher, seneca, nine, of, seneca, s, tragedies, survive, all, of, which, are, fabula, crepidata, tragedies, adapted, from, greek, originals, his, phaedra, for, example, was, based, on, euripides, hippolytus, historians, do, not, know, who, wrote, the, only, extant, example, of, the, fabula, praetexta, tragedies, based, on, roman, subjects, octavia, but, in, former, times, it, was, mistakenly, attributed, to, seneca, due, to, his, appearance, as, a, character, in, the, tragedy, seneca, s, tragedies, rework, those, of, all, three, of, the, athenian, tragic, playwrights, whose, work, has, survived, probably, meant, to, be, recited, at, elite, gatherings, they, differ, from, the, greek, versions, in, their, long, declamatory, narrative, accounts, of, action, their, obtrusive, moralising, and, their, bombastic, rhetoric, they, dwell, on, detailed, accounts, of, horrible, deeds, and, contain, long, reflective, soliloquies, though, the, gods, rarely, appear, in, these, plays, ghosts, and, witches, abound, senecan, tragedies, explore, ideas, of, revenge, the, occult, the, supernatural, suicide, blood, and, gore, the, renaissance, scholar, julius, caesar, scaliger, 1484, 1558, who, knew, both, latin, and, greek, preferred, seneca, to, euripides, classical, greek, drama, was, largely, forgotten, in, western, europe, from, the, middle, ages, to, the, beginning, of, the, 16th, century, medieval, theatre, was, dominated, by, mystery, plays, morality, plays, farces, and, miracle, plays, in, italy, the, models, for, tragedy, in, the, later, middle, ages, were, roman, particularly, the, works, of, seneca, interest, in, which, was, reawakened, by, the, paduan, lovato, de, lovati, 1241, 1309, his, pupil, albertino, mussato, 1261, 1329, also, of, padua, in, 1315, wrote, the, latin, verse, tragedy, eccerinis, which, uses, the, story, of, the, tyrant, ezzelino, iii, da, romano, to, highlight, the, danger, to, padua, posed, by, cangrande, della, scala, of, verona, it, was, the, first, secular, tragedy, written, since, roman, times, and, may, be, considered, the, first, italian, tragedy, identifiable, as, a, renaissance, work, the, earliest, tragedies, to, employ, purely, classical, themes, are, the, achilles, written, before, 1390, by, antonio, loschi, of, vicenza, c, 1365, 1441, and, the, progne, of, the, venetian, gregorio, correr, 1409, 1464, which, dates, from, 1428, to, 1429, in, 1515, gian, giorgio, trissino, 1478, 1550, of, vicenza, wrote, his, tragedy, sophonisba, in, the, vernacular, that, would, later, be, called, italian, drawn, from, livy, s, account, of, sophonisba, the, carthaginian, princess, who, drank, poison, to, avoid, being, taken, by, the, romans, it, adheres, closely, to, classical, rules, it, was, soon, followed, by, the, oreste, and, rosmunda, of, trissino, s, friend, the, florentine, giovanni, di, bernardo, rucellai, 1475, 1525, both, were, completed, by, early, 1516, and, are, based, on, classical, greek, models, rosmunda, on, the, hecuba, of, euripides, and, oreste, on, the, iphigenia, in, tauris, of, the, same, author, like, sophonisba, they, are, in, italian, and, in, blank, unrhymed, hendecasyllables, another, of, the, first, of, all, modern, tragedies, is, a, castro, by, portuguese, poet, and, playwright, ant, nio, ferreira, written, around, 1550, but, only, published, in, 1587, in, polymetric, verse, most, of, it, being, blank, hendecasyllables, dealing, with, the, murder, of, in, s, de, castro, one, of, the, most, dramatic, episodes, in, portuguese, history, although, these, three, italian, plays, are, often, cited, separately, or, together, as, being, the, first, regular, tragedies, in, modern, times, as, well, as, the, earliest, substantial, works, to, be, written, in, blank, hendecasyllables, they, were, apparently, preceded, by, two, other, works, in, the, vernacular, pamfila, or, filostrato, e, panfila, written, in, 1498, or, 1508, by, antonio, cammelli, antonio, da, pistoia, and, a, sophonisba, by, galeotto, del, carretto, of, 1502, from, about, 1500, printed, copies, in, the, original, languages, of, the, works, of, sophocles, seneca, and, euripides, as, well, as, comedic, writers, such, as, aristophanes, terence, and, plautus, were, available, in, europe, and, the, next, forty, years, saw, humanists, and, poets, translating, and, adapting, their, tragedies, in, the, 1540s, the, european, university, setting, and, especially, from, 1553, on, the, jesuit, colleges, became, host, to, a, neo, latin, theatre, in, latin, written, by, scholars, the, influence, of, seneca, was, particularly, strong, in, its, humanist, tragedy, his, plays, with, their, ghosts, lyrical, passages, and, rhetorical, oratory, brought, a, concentration, on, rhetoric, and, language, over, dramatic, action, to, many, humanist, tragedies, the, most, important, sources, for, french, tragic, theatre, in, the, renaissance, were, the, example, of, seneca, and, the, precepts, of, horace, and, aristotle, and, contemporary, commentaries, by, julius, caesar, scaliger, and, lodovico, castelvetro, although, plots, were, taken, from, classical, authors, such, as, plutarch, suetonius, etc, from, the, bible, from, contemporary, events, and, from, short, story, collections, italian, french, and, spanish, the, greek, tragic, authors, sophocles, and, euripides, would, become, increasingly, important, as, models, by, the, middle, of, the, 17th, century, important, models, were, also, supplied, by, the, spanish, golden, age, playwrights, pedro, calder, n, de, la, barca, tirso, de, molina, and, lope, de, vega, many, of, whose, works, were, translated, and, adapted, for, the, french, stage, dutch, renaissance, and, golden, age, the, common, forms, are, the, in, english, the, most, famous, and, most, successful, tragedies, are, those, of, william, shakespeare, and, his, elizabethan, contemporaries, shakespeare, s, tragedies, include, a, contemporary, of, shakespeare, christopher, marlowe, also, wrote, examples, of, tragedy, in, english, notably, john, webster, 1580, 1635, also, wrote, famous, plays, of, the, genre, domestic, tragedies, are, tragedies, in, which, the, tragic, protagonists, are, ordinary, middle, class, or, working, class, individuals, this, subgenre, contrasts, with, classical, and, neoclassical, tragedy, in, which, the, protagonists, are, of, kingly, or, aristocratic, rank, and, their, downfall, is, an, affair, of, state, as, well, as, a, personal, matter, the, ancient, greek, theorist, aristotle, had, argued, that, tragedy, should, concern, only, great, individuals, with, great, minds, and, souls, because, their, catastrophic, downfall, would, be, more, emotionally, powerful, to, the, audience, only, comedy, should, depict, middle, class, people, domestic, tragedy, breaks, with, aristotle, s, precepts, taking, as, its, subjects, merchants, or, citizens, whose, lives, have, less, consequence, in, the, wider, world, the, advent, of, the, domestic, tragedy, ushered, in, the, first, phase, shift, of, the, genre, focusing, less, on, the, aristotelian, definition, of, the, genre, and, more, on, the, definition, of, tragedy, on, the, scale, of, the, drama, where, tragedy, is, opposed, to, comedy, i, e, melancholic, stories, although, the, utilization, of, key, elements, such, as, suffering, hamartia, morality, and, spectacle, ultimately, ties, this, variety, of, tragedy, to, all, the, rest, this, variant, of, tragedy, has, led, to, the, evolution, and, development, of, tragedies, of, the, modern, era, especially, those, past, the, mid, 1800s, such, as, the, works, of, arthur, miller, eugene, o, neill, and, henrik, ibsen, newly, dealt, with, themes, that, sprang, forth, from, the, domestic, tragedy, movement, include, wrongful, convictions, and, executions, poverty, starvation, addiction, alcoholism, debt, structural, abuse, child, abuse, crime, domestic, violence, social, shunning, depression, and, loneliness, classical, domestic, tragedies, include, contemporary, with, shakespeare, an, entirely, different, approach, to, facilitating, the, rebirth, of, tragedy, was, taken, in, italy, jacopo, peri, in, the, preface, to, his, euridice, refers, to, the, ancient, greeks, and, romans, who, in, the, opinion, of, many, sang, their, staged, tragedies, throughout, in, representing, them, on, stage, the, attempts, of, peri, and, his, contemporaries, to, recreate, ancient, tragedy, gave, rise, to, the, new, italian, musical, genre, of, opera, in, france, tragic, operatic, works, from, the, time, of, lully, to, about, that, of, gluck, were, not, called, opera, but, trag, die, en, musique, tragedy, in, music, or, some, similar, name, the, trag, die, en, musique, is, regarded, as, a, distinct, musical, genre, some, later, operatic, composers, have, also, shared, peri, s, aims, richard, wagner, s, concept, of, gesamtkunstwerk, integrated, work, of, art, for, example, was, intended, as, a, return, to, the, ideal, of, greek, tragedy, in, which, all, the, arts, were, blended, in, service, of, the, drama, nietzsche, in, his, the, birth, of, tragedy, 1872, was, to, support, wagner, in, his, claims, to, be, a, successor, of, the, ancient, dramatists, for, much, of, the, 17th, century, pierre, corneille, who, made, his, mark, on, the, world, of, tragedy, with, plays, like, med, e, 1635, and, le, cid, 1636, was, the, most, successful, writer, of, french, tragedies, corneille, s, tragedies, were, strangely, un, tragic, his, first, version, of, le, cid, was, even, listed, as, a, tragicomedy, for, they, had, happy, endings, in, his, theoretical, works, on, theatre, corneille, redefined, both, comedy, and, tragedy, around, the, following, suppositions, corneille, continued, to, write, plays, through, 1674, mainly, tragedies, but, also, something, he, called, heroic, comedies, and, many, continued, to, be, successes, although, the, irregularities, of, his, theatrical, methods, were, increasingly, criticised, notably, by, fran, ois, h, delin, abb, d, aubignac, and, the, success, of, jean, racine, from, the, late, 1660s, signalled, the, end, of, his, preeminence, jean, racine, s, tragedies, inspired, by, greek, myths, euripides, sophocles, and, seneca, condensed, their, plot, into, a, tight, set, of, passionate, and, duty, bound, conflicts, between, a, small, group, of, noble, characters, and, concentrated, on, these, characters, double, binds, and, the, geometry, of, their, unfulfilled, desires, and, hatreds, racine, s, poetic, skill, was, in, the, representation, of, pathos, and, amorous, passion, like, ph, dre, s, love, for, her, stepson, and, his, impact, was, such, that, emotional, crisis, would, be, the, dominant, mode, of, tragedy, to, the, end, of, the, century, racine, s, two, late, plays, esther, and, athalie, opened, new, doors, to, biblical, subject, matter, and, to, the, use, of, theatre, in, the, education, of, young, women, racine, also, faced, criticism, for, his, irregularities, when, his, play, b, r, nice, was, criticised, for, not, containing, any, deaths, racine, disputed, the, conventional, view, of, tragedy, for, more, on, french, tragedy, of, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, see, french, renaissance, literature, and, french, literature, of, the, 17th, century, towards, the, close, of, the, eighteenth, century, having, studied, her, predecessors, joanna, baillie, wanted, to, revolutionise, theatre, believing, that, it, could, be, used, more, effectively, to, affect, people, s, lives, to, this, end, she, gave, a, new, direction, to, tragedy, which, she, as, the, unveiling, of, the, human, mind, under, the, dominion, of, those, strong, and, fixed, passions, which, seemingly, unprovoked, by, outward, circumstances, will, from, small, beginnings, brood, within, the, breast, till, all, the, better, dispositions, all, the, fair, gifts, of, nature, are, borne, down, before, them, this, theory, she, put, into, practice, in, her, series, of, plays, on, the, passions, in, three, volumes, commencing, in, 1798, and, in, other, dramatic, works, her, method, was, to, create, a, series, of, scenes, and, incidents, intended, to, capture, the, audience, s, inquisitiveness, and, trace, the, progress, of, the, passion, pointing, out, those, stages, in, the, approach, of, the, enemy, when, he, might, have, been, combated, most, successfully, and, where, the, suffering, him, to, pass, may, be, considered, as, occasioning, all, the, misery, that, ensues, bourgeois, tragedy, german, b, rgerliches, trauerspiel, is, a, form, that, developed, in, 18th, century, europe, it, was, a, fruit, of, the, enlightenment, and, the, emergence, of, the, bourgeois, class, and, its, ideals, it, is, characterised, by, the, fact, that, its, protagonists, are, ordinary, citizens, the, first, true, bourgeois, tragedy, was, an, english, play, george, lillo, s, the, london, merchant, or, the, history, of, george, barnwell, which, was, first, performed, in, 1731, usually, gotthold, ephraim, lessing, s, play, miss, sara, sampson, which, was, first, produced, in, 1755, is, said, to, be, the, earliest, b, rgerliches, trauerspiel, in, germany, in, modernist, literature, the, definition, of, tragedy, has, become, less, precise, the, most, fundamental, change, has, been, the, rejection, of, aristotle, s, dictum, that, true, tragedy, can, only, depict, those, with, power, and, high, status, arthur, miller, s, essay, tragedy, and, the, common, man, 1949, argues, that, tragedy, may, also, depict, ordinary, people, in, domestic, surroundings, thus, defining, domestic, tragedies, british, playwright, howard, barker, has, argued, strenuously, for, the, rebirth, of, tragedy, in, the, contemporary, theatre, most, notably, in, his, volume, arguments, for, a, theatre, you, emerge, from, tragedy, equipped, against, lies, after, the, musical, you, re, anybody, s, fool, he, insists, critics, such, as, george, steiner, have, even, been, prepared, to, argue, that, tragedy, may, no, longer, exist, in, comparison, with, its, former, manifestations, in, classical, antiquity, in, the, death, of, tragedy, 1961, george, steiner, outlined, the, characteristics, of, greek, tragedy, and, the, traditions, that, developed, from, that, period, in, the, foreword, 1980, to, a, new, edition, of, his, book, steiner, concluded, that, the, dramas, of, shakespeare, are, not, a, renascence, of, or, a, humanistic, variant, of, the, absolute, tragic, model, they, are, rather, a, rejection, of, this, model, in, the, light, of, tragi, comic, and, realistic, criteria, in, part, this, feature, of, shakespeare, s, mind, is, explained, by, his, bent, of, mind, or, imagination, which, was, so, encompassing, so, receptive, to, the, plurality, of, diverse, orders, of, experience, when, compared, to, the, drama, of, greek, antiquity, and, french, classicism, shakespeare, s, forms, are, richer, but, hybrid, numerous, books, and, plays, continue, to, be, written, in, the, tradition, of, tragedy, to, this, day, examples, include, froth, on, the, daydream, the, road, the, fault, in, our, stars, fat, city, rabbit, hole, requiem, for, a, dream, the, handmaid, s, tale, defining, tragedy, is, no, simple, matter, and, there, are, many, definitions, some, of, which, are, incompatible, with, each, other, oscar, mandel, in, a, definition, of, tragedy, 1961, contrasted, two, essentially, different, means, of, arriving, at, a, definition, first, is, what, he, calls, the, derivative, way, in, which, the, tragedy, is, thought, to, be, an, expression, of, an, ordering, of, the, world, instead, of, asking, what, tragedy, expresses, the, derivative, definition, tends, to, ask, what, expresses, itself, through, tragedy, the, second, is, the, substantive, way, of, defining, tragedy, which, starts, with, the, work, of, art, which, is, assumed, to, contain, the, ordering, of, the, world, substantive, critics, are, interested, in, the, constituent, elements, of, art, rather, than, its, ontological, sources, he, recognizes, four, subclasses, a, definition, by, formal, elements, for, instance, the, supposed, three, unities, b, definition, by, situation, where, one, defines, tragedy, for, instance, as, exhibiting, the, fall, of, a, good, man, c, definition, by, ethical, direction, where, the, critic, is, concerned, with, the, meaning, with, the, intellectual, and, moral, effect, and, d, definition, by, emotional, effect, and, he, cites, aristotle, s, requirement, of, pity, and, fear, aristotle, wrote, in, his, work, poetics, that, tragedy, is, characterised, by, seriousness, and, involves, a, great, person, who, experiences, a, reversal, of, fortune, peripeteia, aristotle, s, definition, can, include, a, change, of, fortune, from, bad, to, good, as, in, the, eumenides, but, he, says, that, the, change, from, good, to, bad, as, in, oedipus, rex, is, preferable, because, this, induces, pity, and, fear, within, the, spectators, tragedy, results, in, a, catharsis, emotional, cleansing, or, healing, for, the, audience, through, their, experience, of, these, emotions, in, response, to, the, suffering, of, the, characters, in, the, drama, according, to, aristotle, the, structure, of, the, best, tragedy, should, not, be, simple, but, complex, and, one, that, represents, incidents, arousing, fear, and, pity, for, that, is, peculiar, to, this, form, of, art, this, reversal, of, fortune, must, be, caused, by, the, tragic, hero, s, hamartia, which, is, often, translated, as, either, a, character, flaw, or, as, a, mistake, since, the, original, greek, etymology, traces, back, to, hamartanein, a, sporting, term, that, refers, to, an, archer, or, spear, thrower, missing, his, target, according, to, aristotle, the, misfortune, is, brought, about, not, by, vice, or, depravity, but, by, some, error, or, frailty, the, reversal, is, the, inevitable, but, unforeseen, result, of, some, action, taken, by, the, hero, it, is, also, a, misconception, that, this, reversal, can, be, brought, about, by, a, higher, power, e, g, the, law, the, gods, fate, or, society, but, if, a, character, s, downfall, is, brought, about, by, an, external, cause, aristotle, describes, this, as, a, misadventure, and, not, a, tragedy, in, addition, the, tragic, hero, may, achieve, some, revelation, or, recognition, anagnorisis, knowing, again, or, knowing, back, or, knowing, throughout, about, human, fate, destiny, and, the, will, of, the, gods, aristotle, terms, this, sort, of, recognition, a, change, from, ignorance, to, awareness, of, a, bond, of, love, or, hate, in, poetics, aristotle, gave, the, following, definition, in, ancient, greek, of, the, word, tragedy, tragedy, is, an, imitation, of, an, action, that, is, admirable, complete, composed, of, an, introduction, a, middle, part, and, an, ending, and, possesses, magnitude, in, language, made, pleasurable, each, of, its, species, separated, in, different, parts, performed, by, actors, not, through, narration, effecting, through, pity, and, fear, the, purification, of, such, emotions, common, usage, of, tragedy, refers, to, any, story, with, a, sad, ending, whereas, to, be, an, aristotelian, tragedy, the, story, must, fit, the, set, of, requirements, as, laid, out, by, poetics, by, this, definition, social, drama, cannot, be, tragic, because, the, hero, in, it, is, a, victim, of, circumstance, and, incidents, that, depend, upon, the, society, in, which, he, lives, and, not, upon, the, inner, compulsions, psychological, or, religious, which, determine, his, progress, towards, self, knowledge, and, death, exactly, what, constitutes, a, tragedy, however, is, a, frequently, debated, matter, according, to, aristotle, there, are, four, species, of, tragedy, g, w, f, hegel, the, german, philosopher, most, famous, for, his, dialectical, approach, to, epistemology, and, history, also, applied, such, a, methodology, to, his, theory, of, tragedy, in, his, essay, hegel, s, theory, of, tragedy, a, c, bradley, first, introduced, the, english, speaking, world, to, hegel, s, theory, which, bradley, called, the, tragic, collision, and, contrasted, against, the, aristotelian, notions, of, the, tragic, hero, and, his, or, her, hamartia, in, subsequent, analyses, of, the, aeschylus, oresteia, trilogy, and, of, sophocles, antigone, hegel, himself, however, in, his, seminal, the, phenomenology, of, spirit, argues, for, a, more, complicated, theory, of, tragedy, with, two, complementary, branches, which, though, driven, by, a, single, dialectical, principle, differentiate, greek, tragedy, from, that, which, follows, shakespeare, his, later, lectures, formulate, such, a, theory, of, tragedy, as, a, conflict, of, ethical, forces, represented, by, characters, in, ancient, greek, tragedy, but, in, shakespearean, tragedy, the, conflict, is, rendered, as, one, of, subject, and, object, of, individual, personality, which, must, manifest, self, destructive, passions, because, only, such, passions, are, strong, enough, to, defend, the, individual, from, a, hostile, and, capricious, external, world, the, heroes, of, ancient, classical, tragedy, encounter, situations, in, which, if, they, firmly, decide, in, favor, of, the, one, ethical, pathos, that, alone, suits, their, finished, character, they, must, necessarily, come, into, conflict, with, the, equally, justified, ethical, power, that, confronts, them, modern, characters, on, the, other, hand, stand, in, a, wealth, of, more, accidental, circumstances, within, which, one, could, act, this, way, or, that, so, that, the, conflict, is, though, occasioned, by, external, preconditions, still, essentially, grounded, in, the, character, the, new, individuals, in, their, passions, obey, their, own, nature, simply, because, they, are, what, they, are, greek, heroes, also, act, in, accordance, with, individuality, but, in, ancient, tragedy, such, individuality, is, necessarily, a, self, contained, ethical, pathos, in, modern, tragedy, however, the, character, in, its, peculiarity, decides, in, accordance, with, subjective, desires, such, that, congruity, of, character, with, outward, ethical, aim, no, longer, constitutes, an, essential, basis, of, tragic, beauty, hegel, s, comments, on, a, particular, play, may, better, elucidate, his, theory, viewed, externally, hamlet, s, death, may, be, seen, to, have, been, brought, about, accidentally, but, in, hamlet, s, soul, we, understand, that, death, has, lurked, from, the, beginning, the, sandbank, of, finitude, cannot, suffice, his, sorrow, and, tenderness, such, grief, and, nausea, at, all, conditions, of, life, we, feel, he, is, a, man, whom, inner, disgust, has, almost, consumed, well, before, death, comes, upon, him, from, outside
