people, south, arabian, deities, islamic, art, is, a, part, of, islamic, culture, and, encompasses, the, visual, arts, produced, since, the, 7th, century, ce, by, people, who, lived, within, territories, inhabited, or, ruled, by, muslim, populations, referring, to, characteristic, traditions, across, a, wide, range, of, lands, periods, and, genres, islamic, art, is, a, concept, used, first, by, western, art, historians, in, the, late, 19th, century, public, islamic, art, is, traditionally, non, representational, except, for, the, widespread, use, of, plant, forms, usually, in, varieties, of, the, spiralling, arabesque, these, are, often, combined, with, islamic, calligraphy, geometric, patterns, in, styles, that, are, typically, found, in, a, wide, variety, of, media, from, small, objects, in, ceramic, or, metalwork, to, large, decorative, schemes, in, tiling, on, the, outside, and, inside, of, large, buildings, including, mosques, other, forms, of, islamic, art, include, islamic, miniature, painting, artefacts, like, islamic, glass, or, pottery, and, textile, arts, such, as, carpets, and, embroidery, the, early, developments, of, islamic, art, were, influenced, by, roman, art, early, christian, art, particularly, byzantine, art, and, sassanian, art, with, later, influences, from, central, asian, nomadic, traditions, chinese, art, had, a, significant, influence, on, islamic, painting, pottery, and, textiles, from, its, beginnings, islamic, art, has, been, based, on, the, written, version, of, the, quran, and, other, seminal, religious, works, which, is, reflected, by, the, important, role, of, calligraphy, representing, the, word, as, the, medium, of, divine, revelation, religious, islamic, art, has, been, typically, characterized, by, the, absence, of, figures, and, extensive, use, of, calligraphic, geometric, and, abstract, floral, patterns, nevertheless, representations, of, human, and, animal, forms, historically, flourished, in, nearly, all, islamic, cultures, although, partly, because, of, opposing, religious, sentiments, living, beings, in, paintings, were, often, stylized, giving, rise, to, a, variety, of, decorative, figural, designs, both, religious, and, secular, art, objects, often, exhibit, the, same, references, styles, and, forms, these, include, calligraphy, architecture, textiles, and, furnishings, such, as, carpets, and, woodwork, secular, arts, and, crafts, include, the, production, of, textiles, such, as, clothing, carpets, or, tents, as, well, as, household, objects, made, from, metal, wood, or, other, materials, further, figurative, miniature, paintings, have, a, rich, tradition, especially, in, persian, mughal, and, ottoman, painting, these, pictures, were, often, meant, to, illustrate, well, known, historical, or, poetic, stories, some, interpretations, of, islam, however, include, a, ban, of, depiction, of, animate, beings, also, known, as, aniconism, islamic, aniconism, stems, in, part, from, the, prohibition, of, idolatry, and, in, part, from, the, belief, that, creation, of, living, forms, is, god, s, prerogative, although, the, concept, of, islamic, art, has, been, put, into, question, by, some, modern, art, historians, as, a, construct, of, western, cultural, views, the, similarities, between, art, produced, at, widely, different, times, and, places, in, the, muslim, world, especially, in, the, islamic, golden, age, have, been, sufficient, to, keep, the, term, in, wide, use, as, a, useful, classification, since, the, late, 19th, century, scholars, such, as, jacelyn, k, kerner, have, drawn, attention, to, its, wide, ranging, scope, referring, to, more, than, 40, nations, and, to, the, growing, public, interest, both, in, western, as, well, as, more, recently, in, muslim, societies, further, the, list, of, islamic, museums, bears, witness, to, this, art, historical, term, having, found, wide, acceptance, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, defines, islamic, arts, as, including, visual, arts, literature, performing, arts, and, music, that, virtually, defies, any, comprehensive, definition, in, a, strict, sense, the, term, might, only, refer, to, artistic, manifestations, that, are, closely, related, to, religious, practice, most, often, however, it, is, meant, to, include, all, of, the, arts, produced, by, muslim, peoples, whether, connected, with, their, religion, or, not, calligraphic, design, is, omnipresent, in, islamic, art, where, as, in, europe, in, the, middle, ages, religious, exhortations, including, qur, anic, verses, may, be, included, in, secular, objects, especially, coins, tiles, and, metalwork, and, most, painted, miniatures, include, some, script, as, do, many, buildings, use, of, islamic, calligraphy, in, architecture, extended, significantly, outside, of, islamic, territories, one, notable, example, is, the, use, of, chinese, calligraphy, of, arabic, verses, from, the, qur, an, in, the, great, mosque, of, xi, an, other, inscriptions, include, verses, of, poetry, and, inscriptions, recording, ownership, or, donation, two, of, the, main, scripts, involved, are, the, symbolic, kufic, and, naskh, scripts, which, can, be, found, adorning, and, enhancing, the, visual, appeal, of, the, walls, and, domes, of, buildings, the, sides, of, minbars, and, metalwork, islamic, calligraphy, in, the, form, of, painting, or, sculptures, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, quranic, art, the, various, forms, of, traditional, arabic, calligraphy, and, decoration, of, the, manuscripts, used, for, written, versions, of, the, qur, an, represent, a, central, tradition, of, islamic, visual, art, the, arabesque, is, often, used, to, symbolize, the, transcendent, indivisible, and, infinite, nature, of, god, mistakes, in, repetitions, may, be, intentionally, introduced, as, a, show, of, humility, by, artists, who, believe, only, god, can, produce, perfection, although, this, theory, has, also, been, disputed, east, persian, pottery, from, the, 9th, to, 11th, centuries, decorated, only, with, highly, stylised, inscriptions, and, called, epigraphic, ware, has, been, described, as, probably, the, most, refined, and, sensitive, of, all, persian, pottery, large, inscriptions, made, from, tiles, sometimes, with, the, letters, raised, in, relief, or, the, background, cut, away, are, found, on, the, interiors, and, exteriors, of, many, important, buildings, complex, carved, calligraphy, also, decorates, buildings, for, most, of, the, islamic, period, the, majority, of, coins, only, showed, lettering, which, are, often, very, elegant, despite, their, small, size, and, nature, of, production, the, tughra, or, monogram, of, an, ottoman, sultan, was, used, extensively, on, official, documents, with, very, elaborate, decoration, for, important, ones, other, single, sheets, of, calligraphy, designed, for, albums, might, contain, short, poems, qur, anic, verses, or, other, texts, the, main, languages, all, using, arabic, script, are, arabic, always, used, for, qur, anic, verses, persian, in, the, persianate, world, especially, for, poetry, and, turkish, with, urdu, appearing, in, later, centuries, calligraphers, usually, had, a, higher, status, than, other, artists, for, a, long, time, islam, was, considered, aniconic, existing, pictures, among, the, muslim, royalty, have, been, described, as, an, aberration, by, sir, thomas, arnold, and, ascribed, to, only, a, later, persinate, and, turkic, cultural, period, however, figurative, arts, existed, since, the, formative, stage, of, islam, such, arts, have, been, boasted, by, arabic, speaking, caliphats, of, baghdad, cairo, and, cordova, inspired, by, sasanid, and, byzantine, models, figurative, arts, enjoyed, prestige, among, both, orthodox, sunni, circles, as, well, as, shia, muslims, the, disappearance, of, royal, sponsored, figurative, arts, in, arabic, speaking, lands, at, a, later, period, is, best, explained, by, the, overthrow, of, their, ruling, dynasties, and, reduction, of, most, their, territories, to, ottoman, provincial, dependencies, not, by, religious, prohibition, another, drawback, for, arnold, s, argument, against, the, religious, value, of, figurative, arts, in, islamic, culture, is, that, a, sizable, number, of, rulers, ordering, figurative, arts, in, the, 14th, 17th, century, were, religious, zealots, proclaiming, to, spread, and, enforce, the, laws, of, the, sharia, although, not, many, early, examples, survived, human, figurative, art, was, a, continuous, tradition, in, islamic, lands, notably, several, of, the, umayyad, desert, castles, c, 660, 750, and, during, the, abbasid, caliphate, c, 749, 1258, prior, to, the, early, 14th, century, a, halo, was, a, common, symbol, to, designate, rulers, under, asian, influence, the, halo, as, a, symbol, of, sacredness, was, replaced, by, a, flame, reminiscent, of, the, islamic, prophet, solomon, rulers, were, often, depicted, as, sitting, on, a, throne, endowed, with, religious, symbols, an, ivory, casket, carved, in, early, eleventh, century, cordova, shows, a, spanish, muslim, ruler, holding, a, cup, seated, upon, a, lion, throne, similar, to, that, of, solomon, a, late, 12th, 13th, century, bowl, depicts, an, enthroned, seljuk, ruler, with, messengers, to, either, side, and, headed, winged, jinn, other, usage, of, early, figurative, arts, are, illustrations, of, animal, fables, many, of, them, are, of, sanskrit, origin, and, translated, into, middle, persian, in, the, sixth, century, for, delight, ethical, discussion, and, political, edification, in, the, 8th, century, they, were, translated, into, arabic, although, there, has, been, a, tradition, of, wall, paintings, especially, in, the, persianate, world, the, best, surviving, and, highest, developed, form, of, painting, in, the, islamic, world, is, the, miniature, in, illuminated, manuscripts, or, later, as, a, single, page, for, inclusion, in, a, muraqqa, or, bound, album, of, miniatures, and, calligraphy, the, tradition, of, the, persian, miniature, has, been, dominant, since, about, the, 13th, century, strongly, influencing, the, ottoman, miniature, of, turkey, and, the, mughal, miniature, in, india, the, term, persian, miniature, refers, whereby, to, the, language, used, to, decorate, the, images, and, should, not, obscure, its, ties, to, arabic, imagery, siyah, qalam, black, pen, frequently, depicts, anecdotes, charged, with, islamic, imagery, about, the, animal, souls, nafs, and, the, ruling, soul, r, most, human, characters, are, clothed, like, dervishes, and, bearded, like, ascetics, in, islamic, tradition, animals, often, feature, as, symbol, of, the, lower, and, untaimed, self, the, abstract, forces, to, tame, the, physical, body, are, depicted, in, the, forms, of, demons, d, v, and, angels, chinese, influences, included, the, early, adoption, of, the, vertical, format, natural, to, a, book, which, led, to, the, development, of, a, birds, eye, view, where, a, very, carefully, depicted, background, of, hilly, landscape, or, palace, buildings, rises, up, to, leave, only, a, small, area, of, sky, the, figures, are, arranged, in, different, planes, on, the, background, with, recession, distance, from, the, viewer, indicated, by, placing, more, distant, figures, higher, up, in, the, space, but, at, essentially, the, same, size, the, colours, which, are, often, very, well, preserved, are, strongly, contrasting, bright, and, clear, the, tradition, reached, a, climax, in, the, 16th, and, early, 17th, centuries, but, continued, until, the, early, 19th, century, and, has, been, revived, in, the, 20th, since, the, mid, 20th, century, following, the, departure, of, the, dutch, colonialists, several, indonesian, painters, combined, abstract, expressionism, with, geometric, forms, indonesian, symbols, and, islamic, calligraphy, creating, religiously, influenced, abstract, art, the, spiritual, centre, of, this, movement, is, the, bandung, institute, of, technology, itb, with, leading, teachers, such, as, a, d, pirous, ahmad, sadali, mochtar, apin, and, umi, dachlan, as, their, main, representatives, in, the, 21th, century, iconophobic, followers, of, various, islamist, groups, such, as, the, taliban, aim, to, destroy, forms, of, islamic, figurative, depictions, motivated, by, saudi, mentors, wahhabism, the, taliban, launched, an, attack, on, arts, in, march, 2001, in, afghanistan, the, religious, justification, derives, from, a, hadith, mentioned, by, sahih, bukhari, others, see, the, rejection, of, iconography, as, rooting, in, a, strict, aversion, to, depiction, of, god, throughout, islamic, tradition, no, islamic, artistic, product, has, become, better, known, outside, the, islamic, world, than, the, pile, carpet, more, commonly, referred, to, as, the, oriental, carpet, oriental, rug, their, versatility, is, utilized, in, everyday, islamic, and, muslim, life, from, floor, coverings, to, architectural, enrichment, from, cushions, to, bolsters, to, bags, and, sacks, of, all, shapes, and, sizes, and, to, religious, objects, such, as, a, prayer, rug, which, would, provide, a, clean, place, to, pray, they, have, been, a, major, export, to, other, areas, since, the, late, middle, ages, used, to, cover, not, only, floors, but, tables, for, long, a, widespread, european, practice, that, is, now, common, only, in, the, netherlands, carpet, weaving, is, a, rich, and, deeply, embedded, tradition, in, islamic, societies, and, the, practice, is, seen, in, large, city, factories, as, well, as, in, rural, communities, and, nomadic, encampments, in, earlier, periods, special, establishments, and, workshops, were, in, existence, that, functioned, directly, under, court, patronage, very, early, islamic, carpets, i, e, those, before, the, 16th, century, are, extremely, rare, more, have, survived, in, the, west, and, oriental, carpets, in, renaissance, painting, from, europe, are, a, major, source, of, information, on, them, as, they, were, valuable, imports, that, were, painted, accurately, the, most, natural, and, easy, designs, for, a, carpet, weaver, to, produce, consist, of, straight, lines, and, edges, and, the, earliest, islamic, carpets, to, survive, or, be, shown, in, paintings, have, geometric, designs, or, centre, on, very, stylized, animals, made, up, in, this, way, since, the, flowing, loops, and, curves, of, the, arabesque, are, central, to, islamic, art, the, interaction, and, tension, between, these, two, styles, was, long, a, major, feature, of, carpet, design, there, are, a, few, survivals, of, the, grand, egyptian, 16th, century, carpets, including, one, almost, as, good, as, new, discovered, in, the, attic, of, the, pitti, palace, in, florence, whose, complex, patterns, of, octagon, roundels, and, stars, in, just, a, few, colours, shimmer, before, the, viewer, production, of, this, style, of, carpet, began, under, the, mamluks, but, continued, after, the, ottomans, conquered, egypt, the, other, sophisticated, tradition, was, the, persian, carpet, which, reached, its, peak, in, the, 16th, and, early, 17th, century, in, works, like, the, ardabil, carpet, and, coronation, carpet, during, this, century, the, ottoman, and, mughal, courts, also, began, to, sponsor, the, making, in, their, domains, of, large, formal, carpets, evidently, with, the, involvement, of, designers, used, to, the, latest, court, style, in, the, general, persian, tradition, these, use, a, design, style, shared, with, non, figurative, islamic, illumination, and, other, media, often, with, a, large, central, gul, motif, and, always, with, wide, and, strongly, demarcated, borders, the, grand, designs, of, the, workshops, patronized, by, the, court, spread, out, to, smaller, carpets, for, the, merely, wealthy, and, for, export, and, designs, close, to, those, of, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, are, still, produced, in, large, numbers, today, the, description, of, older, carpets, has, tended, to, use, the, names, of, carpet, making, centres, as, labels, but, often, derived, from, the, design, rather, than, any, actual, evidence, that, they, originated, from, around, that, centre, research, has, clarified, that, designs, were, by, no, means, always, restricted, to, the, centre, they, are, traditionally, associated, with, and, the, origin, of, many, carpets, remains, unclear, as, well, as, the, major, persian, turkish, and, arab, centres, carpets, were, also, made, across, central, asia, in, india, and, in, spain, and, the, balkans, spanish, carpets, which, sometimes, interrupted, typical, islamic, patterns, to, include, coats, of, arms, enjoyed, high, prestige, in, europe, being, commissioned, by, royalty, and, for, the, papal, palace, avignon, and, the, industry, continued, after, the, reconquista, armenian, carpet, weaving, is, mentioned, by, many, early, sources, and, may, account, for, a, much, larger, proportion, of, east, turkish, and, caucasian, production, than, traditionally, thought, the, berber, carpets, of, north, africa, have, a, distinct, design, tradition, apart, from, the, products, of, city, workshops, in, touch, with, trading, networks, that, might, carry, the, carpets, to, markets, far, away, there, was, also, a, large, and, widespread, village, and, nomadic, industry, producing, work, that, stayed, closer, to, traditional, local, designs, as, well, as, pile, carpets, kelims, and, other, types, of, flat, weave, or, embroidered, textiles, were, produced, for, use, on, both, floors, and, walls, figurative, designs, sometimes, with, large, human, figures, are, very, popular, in, islamic, countries, but, relatively, rarely, exported, to, the, west, where, abstract, designs, are, generally, what, the, market, expects, islamic, art, has, very, notable, achievements, in, ceramics, both, in, pottery, and, tiles, for, walls, which, in, the, absence, of, wall, paintings, were, taken, to, heights, unmatched, by, other, cultures, early, pottery, is, often, unglazed, but, tin, opacified, glazing, was, one, of, the, earliest, new, technologies, developed, by, the, islamic, potters, the, first, islamic, opaque, glazes, can, be, found, as, blue, painted, ware, in, basra, dating, to, around, the, 8th, century, another, significant, contribution, was, the, development, of, stonepaste, ceramics, originating, from, 9th, century, iraq, the, first, industrial, complex, for, glass, and, pottery, production, was, built, in, raqqa, syria, in, the, 8th, century, other, centers, for, innovative, pottery, in, the, islamic, world, included, fustat, from, 975, to, 1075, damascus, from, 1100, to, around, 1600, and, tabriz, from, 1470, to, 1550, lusterwares, with, iridescent, colours, may, have, continued, pre, islamic, roman, and, byzantine, techniques, but, were, either, invented, or, considerably, developed, on, pottery, and, glass, in, persia, and, syria, from, the, 9th, century, onwards, islamic, pottery, was, often, influenced, by, chinese, ceramics, whose, achievements, were, greatly, admired, and, emulated, this, was, especially, the, case, in, the, periods, after, the, mongol, invasions, and, those, of, the, timurids, techniques, shapes, and, decorative, motifs, were, all, affected, until, the, early, modern, period, western, ceramics, had, very, little, influence, but, islamic, pottery, was, very, sought, after, in, europe, and, often, copied, an, example, of, this, is, the, albarello, a, type, of, maiolica, earthenware, jar, originally, designed, to, hold, apothecaries, ointments, and, dry, drugs, the, development, of, this, type, of, pharmacy, jar, had, its, roots, in, the, islamic, middle, east, hispano, moresque, examples, were, exported, to, italy, stimulating, the, earliest, italian, examples, from, 15th, century, florence, the, hispano, moresque, style, emerged, in, al, andaluz, or, muslim, spain, in, the, 8th, century, under, egyptian, influence, but, most, of, the, best, production, was, much, later, by, potters, presumed, to, have, been, largely, muslim, but, working, in, areas, reconquered, by, the, christian, kingdoms, it, mixed, islamic, and, european, elements, in, its, designs, and, much, was, exported, across, neighbouring, european, countries, it, had, introduced, two, ceramic, techniques, to, europe, glazing, with, an, opaque, white, tin, glaze, and, painting, in, metallic, lusters, ottoman, znik, pottery, produced, most, of, the, best, work, in, the, 16th, century, in, tiles, and, large, vessels, boldly, decorated, with, floral, motifs, influenced, once, again, by, chinese, yuan, and, ming, ceramics, these, were, still, in, earthenware, there, was, no, porcelain, made, in, islamic, countries, until, modern, times, though, chinese, porcelain, was, imported, and, admired, the, medieval, islamic, world, also, had, pottery, with, painted, animal, and, human, imagery, examples, are, found, throughout, the, medieval, islamic, world, particularly, in, persia, and, egypt, the, earliest, grand, islamic, buildings, like, the, dome, of, the, rock, in, jerusalem, had, interior, walls, decorated, with, mosaics, in, the, byzantine, style, but, without, human, figures, from, the, 9th, century, onwards, the, distinctive, islamic, tradition, of, glazed, and, brightly, coloured, tiling, for, interior, and, exterior, walls, and, domes, developed, some, earlier, schemes, create, designs, using, mixtures, of, tiles, each, of, a, single, colour, that, are, either, cut, to, shape, or, are, small, and, of, a, few, shapes, used, to, create, abstract, geometric, patterns, later, large, painted, schemes, use, tiles, painted, before, firing, with, a, part, of, the, scheme, a, technique, requiring, confidence, in, the, consistent, results, of, firing, some, elements, especially, the, letters, of, inscriptions, may, be, moulded, in, three, dimensional, relief, and, in, especially, in, persia, certain, tiles, in, a, design, may, have, figurative, painting, of, animals, or, single, human, figures, these, were, often, part, of, designs, mostly, made, up, of, tiles, in, plain, colours, but, with, larger, fully, painted, tiles, at, intervals, the, larger, tiles, are, often, shaped, as, eight, pointed, stars, and, may, show, animals, or, a, human, head, or, bust, or, plant, or, other, motifs, the, geometric, patterns, such, as, modern, north, african, zellij, work, made, of, small, tiles, each, of, a, single, colour, but, different, and, regular, shapes, are, often, referred, to, as, mosaic, which, is, not, strictly, correct, the, mughals, made, much, less, use, of, tiling, preferring, and, being, able, to, afford, parchin, kari, a, type, of, pietra, dura, decoration, from, inlaid, panels, of, semi, precious, stones, with, jewels, in, some, cases, this, can, be, seen, at, the, taj, mahal, agra, fort, and, other, imperial, commissions, the, motifs, are, usually, floral, in, a, simpler, and, more, realistic, style, than, persian, or, turkish, work, relating, to, plants, in, mughal, miniatures, for, most, of, the, middle, ages, islamic, glass, was, the, most, sophisticated, in, eurasia, exported, to, both, europe, and, china, islam, took, over, much, of, the, traditional, glass, producing, territory, of, sassanian, and, ancient, roman, glass, and, since, figurative, decoration, played, a, small, part, in, pre, islamic, glass, the, change, in, style, is, not, abrupt, except, that, the, whole, area, initially, formed, a, political, whole, and, for, example, persian, innovations, were, now, almost, immediately, taken, up, in, egypt, for, this, reason, it, is, often, impossible, to, distinguish, between, the, various, centres, of, production, of, which, egypt, syria, and, persia, were, the, most, important, except, by, scientific, analysis, of, the, material, which, itself, has, difficulties, from, various, documentary, references, glassmaking, and, glass, trading, seems, to, have, been, a, speciality, of, the, jewish, minority, in, several, centres, between, the, 8th, and, early, 11th, centuries, the, emphasis, in, luxury, glass, was, on, effects, achieved, by, manipulating, the, surface, of, the, glass, initially, by, incising, into, the, glass, on, a, wheel, and, later, by, cutting, away, the, background, to, leave, a, design, in, relief, the, very, massive, hedwig, glasses, only, found, in, europe, but, normally, considered, islamic, or, possibly, from, muslim, craftsmen, in, norman, sicily, are, an, example, of, this, though, puzzlingly, late, in, date, these, and, other, glass, pieces, probably, represented, cheaper, versions, of, vessels, of, carved, rock, crystal, clear, quartz, themselves, influenced, by, earlier, glass, vessels, and, there, is, some, evidence, that, at, this, period, glass, cutting, and, hardstone, carving, were, regarded, as, the, same, craft, from, the, 12th, century, the, industry, in, persia, and, mesopotamia, appears, to, decline, and, the, main, production, of, luxury, glass, shifts, to, egypt, and, syria, and, decorative, effects, of, colour, on, smooth, surfaced, glass, throughout, the, period, local, centres, made, simpler, wares, such, as, hebron, glass, in, palestine, lustre, painting, by, techniques, similar, to, lustreware, in, pottery, dates, back, to, the, 8th, century, in, egypt, and, became, widespread, in, the, 12th, century, another, technique, was, decoration, with, threads, of, glass, of, a, different, colour, worked, into, the, main, surface, and, sometimes, manipulated, by, combing, and, other, effects, gilded, painted, and, enameled, glass, were, added, to, the, repertoire, and, shapes, and, motifs, borrowed, from, other, media, such, as, pottery, and, metalwork, some, of, the, finest, work, was, in, mosaic, lamps, donated, by, a, ruler, or, wealthy, man, as, decoration, grew, more, elaborate, the, quality, of, the, basic, glass, decreased, and, it, often, has, a, brownish, yellow, tinge, and, is, rarely, free, from, bubbles, aleppo, seems, to, have, ceased, to, be, a, major, centre, after, the, mongol, invasion, of, 1260, and, timur, appears, to, have, ended, the, syrian, industry, about, 1400, by, carrying, off, the, skilled, workers, to, samarkand, by, about, 1500, the, venetians, were, receiving, large, orders, for, mosque, lamps, medieval, islamic, metalwork, offers, a, complete, contrast, to, its, european, equivalent, which, is, dominated, by, modelled, figures, and, brightly, coloured, decoration, in, enamel,

the, byzantine, and, sassanian, traditions, of, grand, figured, silk, woven, cloth, continued, under, muslim, rule, some, designs, are, calligraphic, especially, when, made, for, palls, to, cover, a, tomb, but, more, are, surprisingly, conservative, versions, of, the, earlier, traditions, with, many, large, figures, of, animals, especially, majestic, symbols, of, power, like, the, lion, and, eagle, these, are, often, enclosed, in, roundels, as, found, in, the, pre, islamic, traditions, the, majority, of, early, silks, have, been, recovered, from, tombs, and, in, europe, reliquaries, where, the, relics, were, often, wrapped, in, silk, european, clergy, and, nobility, were, keen, buyers, of, islamic, silk, from, an, early, date, and, for, example, the, body, of, an, early, bishop, of, toul, in, france, was, wrapped, in, a, silk, from, the, bukhara, area, in, modern, uzbekistan, probably, when, the, body, was, reburied, in, 820, the, shroud, of, st, josse, is, a, famous, samite,

kufic, script, from, which, the, date, appears, to, be, before, 961, other, silks, were, used, for, clothes, hangings, altarcloths, and, church, vestments, which, have, nearly, all, been, lost, except, for, some, vestments, ottoman, silks, were, less, exported, and, the, many, surviving, royal, kaftans, have, simpler, geometric, patterns, many, featuring, stylized, tiger, stripes, below, three, balls, or, circles, other, silks, have, foliage, designs, comparable, to, those, on, iznik, pottery, or, carpets, with, bands, forming, ogival, compartments, a, popular, motif, some, designs, begin, to, show, italian, influence, by, the, 16th, century, persian, silk, was, using, smaller, patterns, many, of, which, showed, relaxed, garden, scenes, of, beautiful, boys, and, girls, from, the,

general, at, the, siege, of, vienna, in, 1683, mughal, silks, incorporate, many, indian, elements, and, often, feature, relatively, realistic, portraits, of, plants, as, found, in, other, media, the, development, and, refinement, of, indonesian, batik, cloth, was, closely, linked, to, islam, the, islamic, prohibition, on, certain, images, encouraged, batik, design, to, become, more, abstract, and, intricate, realistic, depictions, of, animals, and, humans, are, rare, on, traditional, batik, however, mythical, serpents, humans, with, exaggerated, features, and, the, garuda, of, pre, islamic, mythology, are, common, motifs, although, its, existence, pre, dates, islam, batik, reached, its, zenith, in, royal, muslim, courts, such, as, mataram, and, yogyakarta, whose, sultans, encouraged, and, patronised, batik, production, today, batik, is, undergoing, a, revival, and, cloths, are, used, for, additional, purposes, such, as, wrapping, the, quran, unlike, some, mediums, in, islamic, art, islamic, architecture, was, consistently, prominent, across, the, islamic, world, in, general, patrons, invested, more, resources, into, building, monuments, than, they, did, in, the, production, of, art, objects, and, our, knowledge, of, islamic, architecture, is, more, complete, thanks, to, the, many, buildings, that, have, survived, across, regions, and, periods, early, islamic, architecture, drew, on, existing, regional, traditions, of, architecture, in, late, antiquity, and, later, developed, into, various, regional, traditions, innovations, from, one, region, often, spread, to, others, applied, decoration, played, a, particularly, important, role, in, islamic, architecture, and, this, decoration, made, use, of, the, same, motifs, predominant, in, other, forms, of, islamic, art, arabesques, epigraphy, geometric, patterns, and, other, vegetal, forms, methods, of, decoration, included, carving, inlay, and, painting, in, materials, such, as, brick, stone, tile, plaster, and, wood, the, period, of, a, rapid, expansion, of, the, islamic, era, forms, a, reasonably, accurate, beginning, for, the, label, of, islamic, art, early, geographical, boundaries, of, the, islamic, culture, were, in, present, day, syria, it, is, quite, difficult, to, distinguish, the, earliest, islamic, objects, from, their, predecessors, in, persian, or, sasanian, and, byzantine, art, and, the, conversion, of, the, mass, of, the, population, including, artists, took, a, significant, period, sometimes, centuries, after, the, initial, spread, of, islam, there, was, notably, a, significant, production, of, unglazed, ceramics, witnessed, by, a, famous, small, bowl, preserved, in, the, louvre, whose, inscription, assures, its, attribution, to, the, islamic, period, plant, motifs, were, the, most, important, in, these, early, productions, influences, from, the, sassanian, artistic, tradition, include, the, image, of, the, king, as, a, warrior, and, the, lion, as, a, symbol, of, nobility, and, virility, bedouin, tribal, traditions, mixed, with, the, more, sophisticated, styles, of, the, conquered, territories, for, an, initial, period, coins, had, human, figures, in, the, byzantine, and, sassanian, style, perhaps, to, reassure, users, of, their, continued, value, before, the, islamic, style, with, lettering, only, took, over, religious, and, civic, architecture, were, developed, under, the, umayyad, caliphates, 661, 750, when, new, concepts, and, new, plans, were, put, into, practice, the, dome, of, the, rock, in, jerusalem, is, one, of, the, most, important, buildings, in, all, of, islamic, architecture, marked, by, a, strong, byzantine, influence, mosaic, against, a, gold, ground, and, a, central, plan, that, recalls, that, of, the, church, of, the, holy, sepulchre, but, already, bearing, purely, islamic, elements, such, as, the, great, epigraphic, frieze, the, desert, palaces, in, jordan, and, syria, for, example, mshatta, qusayr, amra, and, hisham, s, palace, served, the, caliphs, as, living, quarters, reception, halls, and, baths, and, were, decorated, including, some, wall, paintings, to, promote, an, image, of, royal, luxury, work, in, ceramics, was, still, somewhat, primitive, and, unglazed, during, this, period, some, metal, objects, have, survived, from, this, time, but, it, remains, rather, difficult, to, distinguish, these, objects, from, those, of, the, pre, islamic, period, abd, al, malik, introduced, standard, coinage, that, featured, arabic, inscriptions, instead, of, images, of, the, monarch, the, quick, development, of, a, localized, coinage, around, the, time, of, the, dome, of, the, rock, s, construction, demonstrates, the, reorientation, of, umayyad, acculturation, this, period, saw, the, genesis, of, a, particularly, islamic, art, in, this, period, umayyad, artists, and, artisans, did, not, invent, a, new, vocabulary, but, began, to, prefer, those, received, from, mediterranean, and, iranian, late, antiquity, which, they, adapted, to, their, own, artistic, conceptions, for, example, the, mosaics, in, the, umayyad, mosque, of, damascus, are, based, on, byzantine, models, but, replace, the, figurative, elements, with, images, of, trees, and, cities, the, desert, palaces, also, bear, witness, to, these, influences, by, combining, the, various, traditions, that, they, had, inherited, and, by, readapting, motifs, and, architectural, elements, artists, created, little, by, little, a, typically, muslim, art, particularly, discernible, in, the, aesthetic, of, the, arabesque, which, appears, both, on, monuments, and, in, illuminated, qurans, some, umayyads, commissioned, erotic, art, for, private, settings, the, umayyad, caliph, al, walid, ii, built, the, qusayr, amra, as, his, country, retreat, whose, decoration, includes, naked, females, and, love, scenes, the, abbasid, caliphate, 750, 1258, witnessed, the, movement, of, the, capital, from, damascus, to, baghdad, and, then, from, baghdad, to, samarra, the, shift, to, baghdad, influenced, politics, culture, and, art, art, historian, robert, hillenbrand, 1999, likens, the, movement, to, the, foundation, of, an, islamic, rome, because, the, meeting, of, eastern, influences, from, iranian, eurasian, steppe, chinese, and, indian, sources, created, a, new, paradigm, for, islamic, art, classical, forms, inherited, from, byzantine, europe, and, greco, roman, sources, were, discarded, in, favor, of, those, drawn, from, the, new, islamic, hub, even, the, design, of, the, city, of, baghdad, placed, it, in, the, navel, of, the, world, as, 9th, century, historian, al, ya, qubi, wrote, the, ancient, city, of, baghdad, cannot, be, excavated, well, as, it, lies, beneath, the, modern, city, however, abbasid, samarra, which, was, largely, abandoned, has, been, well, studied, and, is, known, for, its, surviving, examples, of, stucco, reliefs, in, which, the, prehistory, of, the, arabesque, can, be, traced, motifs, known, from, the, stucco, at, samarra, permit, the, dating, of, structures, built, elsewhere, and, are, furthermore, found, on, portable, objects, particular, in, wood, from, egypt, through, to, iran, samarra, witnessed, the, coming, of, age, of, islamic, art, polychrome, painted, stucco, allowed, for, experimentation, in, new, styles, of, moulding, and, carving, the, abbasid, period, also, coincided, with, two, major, innovations, in, the, ceramic, arts, the, invention, of, faience, and, of, metallic, lusterware, hadithic, prohibition, of, the, use, of, golden, or, silver, vessels, led, to, the, development, of, metallic, lusterware, in, pottery, which, was, made, by, mixing, sulphur, and, metallic, oxides, to, ochre, and, vinegar, painted, onto, an, already, glazed, vessel, and, then, fired, a, second, time, it, was, expensive, and, difficult, to, manage, the, second, round, through, the, kiln, but, the, wish, to, exceed, fine, chinese, porcelain, led, to, the, development, of, this, technique, though, the, common, perception, of, abbasid, artistic, production, focuses, largely, on, pottery, the, greatest, development, of, the, abbasid, period, was, in, textiles, government, run, workshops, known, as, tiraz, produced, silks, bearing, the, name, of, the, monarch, allowing, for, aristocrats, to, demonstrate, their, loyalty, to, the, ruler, other, silks, were, pictorial, the, utility, of, silk, ware, in, wall, decor, entrance, adornment, and, room, separation, was, not, as, important, as, its, cash, value, along, the,

stylized, to, the, point, of, slowing, down, the, recognition, of, the, words, themselves, beginning, in, the, ninth, century, abbasid, sovereignty, was, contested, in, the, provinces, furthest, removed, from, the, iraqi, center, the, creation, of, an, isma, ili, shi, i, dynasty, that, of, the, north, african, fatimid, caliphate, followed, by, the, caliphate, of, c, rdoba, in, the, iberian,

as, al, andalus, was, the, umayyads, descended, from, the, great, umayyad, caliphate, of, syria, after, their, fall, they, were, replaced, by, various, autonomous, kingdoms, the, taifas, 1031, 91, but, the, artistic, production, from, this, period, does, not, differ, significantly, from, that, of, the, umayyads, at, the, end, of, the, 11th, century, two, berber, tribes, the, almoravids, and, the, almohads, captured, the, head, of, the, maghreb, and, spain, successively, bringing, maghrebi, influences, into, art, a, series, of, military, victories, by, christian, monarchs, had, reduced,

assert, themselves, in, syria, as, well, their, most, famous, ruler, was, baibars, the, mamluks, were, not, strictly, speaking, a, dynasty, as, they, did, not, maintain, a, patrilineal, mode, of,

centuries, until, 1517, and, gave, rise, to, abundant, architectural, projects, many, thousands, of, buildings, were, constructed, during, this, period, patronage, of, luxury, arts, favored, primarily, enamelled, glass, and, metalwork, and, is, remembered, as, the, golden, age, of, medieval, egypt, the, baptist, re, de, saint, louis, in, the, louvre, is, an, example, of, the, very, high,

element, of, this, competition, great, cities, were, built, such, as, nishapur, and, ghazni, and, the, construction, of, the, great, mosque, of, isfahan, which, would, continue, in, fits, and, starts, over, several, centuries, was, initiated, funerary, architecture, was, also, cultivated, while, potters, developed, quite, individual, styles, kaleidoscopic, ornament, on, a, yellow, ground, or,

of, seljuq, works, continued, through, the, end, of, the, 12th, and, beginning, of, the, 13th, century, under, the, auspices, of, smaller, independent, sovereigns, and, patrons, during, their, time,

would, receive, often, mention, in, inscriptions, on, mosques, meanwhile, growth, in, mass, market, production, and, sale, of, art, made, it, more, commonplace, and, accessible, to, merchants, and, professionals, because, of, increased, production, many, relics, have, survived, from, the, seljuk, era, and, can, be, easily, dated, in, contrast, the, dating, of, earlier, works, is, more, ambiguous, it, is, therefore, easy, to, mistake, seljuk, art, as, new, developments, rather, than, inheritance, from, classical, iranian, and, turkic, sources, innovations, in, ceramics, from, this, period, include, the, production, of, minai, ware, and, the, manufacture, of, vessels, not, out, of, clay, but, out, of, a, silicon, paste, fritware, while, metalworkers, began, to, encrust, bronze,

civilization, developed, under, these, little, khans, who, were, originally, subservient, to, the, yuan, emperor, but, rapidly, became, independent, architectural, activity, intensified, as, the, mongols, became, sedentary, and, retained, traces, of, their, nomadic, origins, such, as, the, north, south, orientation, of, the, buildings, at, the, same, time, a, process, of, iranisation, took,
