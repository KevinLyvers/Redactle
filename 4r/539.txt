doors, while, in, the, church, the, theotokos, apse, pentecost, scenes, from, christ, s, life, and, ermit, st, loukas, all, executed, before, 1048, the, scenes, are, treated, with, a, minimum, of, detail, and, the, panels, are, dominated, with, the, gold, setting, the, nea, moni, monastery, on, chios, was, established, by, constantine, monomachos, in, 1043, 1056, the, exceptional, mosaic, decoration, of, the, dome, showing, probably, the, nine, orders, of, the, angels, was, destroyed, in, 1822, but, other, panels, survived, theotokos, with, raised, hands, four, evangelists, with, seraphim, scenes, from, christ, s, life, and, an, interesting, anastasis, where, king, salomon, bears, resemblance, to, constantine, monomachos, in, comparison, with, osios, loukas, nea, moni, mosaics, contain, more, figures, detail, landscape, and, setting, another, great, undertaking, by, constantine, monomachos, was, the, restoration, of, the, church, of, the, holy, sepulchre, in, jerusalem, between, 1042, and, 1048, nothing, survived, of, the, mosaics, which, covered, the, walls, and, the, dome, of, the, edifice, but, the, russian, abbot, daniel, who, visited, jerusalem, in, 1106, 1107, left, a, description, lively, mosaics, of, the, holy, prophets, are, under, the, ceiling, over, the, tribune, the, altar, is, surmounted, by, a, mosaic, image, of, christ, in, the, main, altar, one, can, see, the, mosaic, of, the, exaltation, of, adam, in, the, apse, the, ascension, of, christ, the, annunciation, occupies, the, two, pillars, next, to, the, altar, the, daphni, monastery, houses, the, best, preserved, complex, of, mosaics, from, the, early, comnenan, period, ca, 1100, when, the, austere, and, hieratic, manner, typical, for, the, macedonian, epoch, and, represented, by, the, awesome, christ, pantocrator, image, inside, the, dome, was, metamorphosing, into, a, more, intimate, and, delicate, style, of, which, the, angel, before, st, joachim, with, its, pastoral, backdrop, harmonious, gestures, and, pensive, lyricism, is, considered, a, superb, example, the, 9th, and, 10th, century, mosaics, of, the, hagia, sophia, in, constantinople, are, truly, classical, byzantine, artworks, the, north, and, south, tympana, beneath, the, dome, was, decorated, with, figures, of, prophets, saints, and, patriarchs, above, the, principal, door, from, the, narthex, we, can, see, an, emperor, kneeling, before, christ, late, 9th, or, early, 10th, century, above, the, door, from, the, southwest, vestibule, to, the, narthex, another, mosaic, shows, the, theotokos, with, justinian, and, constantine, justinian, i, is, offering, the, model, of, the, church, to, mary, while, constantine, is, holding, a, model, of, the, city, in, his, hand, both, emperors, are, beardless, this, is, an, example, for, conscious, archaization, as, contemporary, byzantine, rulers, were, bearded, a, mosaic, panel, on, the, gallery, shows, christ, with, constantine, monomachos, and, empress, zoe, 1042, 1055, the, emperor, gives, a, bulging, money, sack, to, christ, as, a, donation, for, the, church, the, dome, of, the, hagia, sophia, church, in, thessaloniki, is, decorated, with, an, ascension, mosaic, c, 885, the, composition, resembles, the, great, baptistries, in, ravenna, with, apostles, standing, between, palms, and, christ, in, the, middle, the, scheme, is, somewhat, unusual, as, the, standard, post, iconoclastic, formula, for, domes, contained, only, the, image, of, the, pantokrator, there, are, very, few, existing, mosaics, from, the, komnenian, period, but, this, paucity, must, be, due, to, accidents, of, survival, and, gives, a, misleading, impression, the, only, surviving, 12th, century, mosaic, work, in, constantinople, is, a, panel, in, hagia, sophia, depicting, emperor, john, ii, and, empress, eirene, with, the, theotokos, 1122, 34, the, empress, with, her, long, braided, hair, and, rosy, cheeks, is, especially, capturing, it, must, be, a, lifelike, portrayal, because, eirene, was, really, a, redhead, as, her, original, hungarian, name, piroska, shows, the, adjacent, portrait, of, emperor, alexios, i, komnenos, on, a, pier, from, 1122, is, similarly, personal, the, imperial, mausoleum, of, the, komnenos, dynasty, the, pantokrator, monastery, was, certainly, decorated, with, great, mosaics, but, these, were, later, destroyed, the, lack, of, komnenian, mosaics, outside, the, capital, is, even, more, apparent, there, is, only, a, communion, of, the, apostles, in, the, apse, of, the, cathedral, of, serres, a, striking, technical, innovation, of, the, komnenian, period, was, the, production, of, very, precious, miniature, mosaic, icons, in, these, icons, the, small, tesserae, with, sides, of, 1, mm, or, less, were, set, on, wax, or, resin, on, a, wooden, panel, these, products, of, extraordinary, craftmanship, were, intended, for, private, devotion, the, louvre, transfiguration, is, a, very, fine, example, from, the, late, 12th, century, the, miniature, mosaic, of, christ, in, the, museo, nazionale, at, florence, illustrates, the, more, gentle, humanistic, conception, of, christ, which, appeared, in, the, 12th, century, the, sack, of, constantinople, in, 1204, caused, the, decline, of, mosaic, art, for, the, next, five, decades, after, the, reconquest, of, the, city, by, michael, viii, palaiologos, in, 1261, the, hagia, sophia, was, restored, and, a, beautiful, new, deesis, was, made, on, the, south, gallery, this, huge, mosaic, panel, with, figures, two, and, a, half, times, lifesize, is, really, overwhelming, due, to, its, grand, scale, and, superlative, craftsmanship, the, hagia, sophia, deesis, is, probably, the, most, famous, byzantine, mosaic, in, constantinople, the, pammakaristos, monastery, was, restored, by, michael, glabas, an, imperial, official, in, the, late, 13th, century, only, the, mosaic, decoration, of, the, small, burial, chapel, parekklesion, of, glabas, survived, this, domed, chapel, was, built, by, his, widow, martha, around, 1304, 08, in, the, miniature, dome, the, traditional, pantokrator, can, be, seen, with, twelve, prophets, beneath, unusually, the, apse, is, decorated, with, a, deesis, probably, due, to, the, funerary, function, of, the, chapel, the, church, of, the, holy, apostles, in, thessaloniki, was, built, in, 1310, 14, although, some, vandal, systematically, removed, the, gold, tesserae, of, the, background, it, can, be, seen, that, the, pantokrator, and, the, prophets, in, the, dome, follow, the, traditional, byzantine, pattern, many, details, are, similar, to, the, pammakaristos, mosaics, so, it, is, supposed, that, the, same, team, of, mosaicists, worked, in, both, buildings, another, building, with, a, related, mosaic, decoration, is, the, theotokos, paregoritissa, church, in, arta, the, church, was, established, by, the, despot, of, epirus, in, 1294, 96, in, the, dome, is, the, traditional, stern, pantokrator, with, prophets, and, cherubim, below, the, greatest, mosaic, work, of, the, palaeologan, renaissance, in, art, is, the, decoration, of, the, chora, church, in, constantinople, although, the, mosaics, of, the, naos, have, not, survived, except, three, panels, the, decoration, of, the, exonarthex, and, the, esonarthex, constitute, the, most, important, full, scale, mosaic, cycle, in, constantinople, after, the, hagia, sophia, they, were, executed, around, 1320, by, the, command, of, theodore, metochites, the, esonarthex, has, two, fluted, domes, specially, created, to, provide, the, ideal, setting, for, the, mosaic, images, of, the, ancestors, of, christ, the, southern, one, is, called, the, dome, of, the, pantokrator, while, the, northern, one, is, the, dome, of, the, theotokos, the, most, important, panel, of, the, esonarthex, depicts, theodore, metochites, wearing, a, huge, turban, offering, the, model, of, the, church, to, christ, the, walls, of, both, narthexes, are, decorated, with, mosaic, cycles, from, the, life, of, the, virgin, and, the, life, of, christ, these, panels, show, the, influence, of, the, italian, trecento, on, byzantine, art, especially, the, more, natural, settings, landscapes, figures, the, last, byzantine, mosaic, work, was, created, for, the, hagia, sophia, constantinople, in, the, middle, of, the, 14th, century, the, great, eastern, arch, of, the, cathedral, collapsed, in, 1346, bringing, down, the, third, of, the, main, dome, by, 1355, not, only, the, big, pantokrator, image, was, restored, but, new, mosaics, were, set, on, the, eastern, arch, depicting, the, theotokos, the, baptist, and, emperor, john, v, palaiologos, discovered, only, in, 1989, in, addition, to, the, large, scale, monuments, several, miniature, mosaic, icons, of, outstanding, quality, was, produced, for, the, palaiologos, court, and, nobles, the, loveliest, examples, from, the, 14th, century, are, annunciation, in, the, victoria, and, albert, museum, and, a, mosaic, diptych, in, the, cathedral, treasury, of, florence, representing, the, twelve, feasts, of, the, church, in, the, troubled, years, of, the, 15th, century, the, fatally, weakened, empire, could, not, afford, luxurious, mosaics, churches, were, decorated, with, wall, paintings, in, this, era, and, after, the, turkish, conquest, the, last, great, period, of, roman, mosaic, art, was, the, 12th, 13th, century, when, rome, developed, its, own, distinctive, artistic, style, free, from, the, strict, rules, of, eastern, tradition, and, with, a, more, realistic, portrayal, of, figures, in, the, space, well, known, works, of, this, period, are, the, floral, mosaics, of, the, basilica, di, san, clemente, the, fa, ade, of, santa, maria, in, trastevere, and, san, paolo, fuori, le, mura, the, beautiful, apse, mosaic, of, santa, maria, in, trastevere, 1140, depicts, christ, and, mary, sitting, next, to, each, other, on, the, heavenly, throne, the, first, example, of, this, iconographic, scheme, a, similar, mosaic, the, coronation, of, the, virgin, decorates, the, apse, of, santa, maria, maggiore, it, is, a, work, of, jacopo, torriti, from, 1295, the, mosaics, of, torriti, and, jacopo, da, camerino, in, the, apse, of, san, giovanni, in, laterano, from, 1288, to, 1294, were, thoroughly, restored, in, 1884, the, apse, mosaic, of, san, crisogono, is,

of, san, tommaso, in, formis, showing, christ, enthroned, between, a, white, and, a, black, slave, the, church, belonged, to, the, order, of, the, trinitarians, which, was, devoted, to, ransoming,

and, it, was, also, called, saint, sophia, cathedral, it, was, built, mainly, by, byzantine, master, craftsmen, sent, by, constantine, monomachos, between, 1037, and, 1046, naturally, the, more,

excavated, in, jericho, which, was, named, shalom, al, yisrael, synagogue, after, an, inscription, on, its, mosaic, floor, peace, on, israel, it, appears, to, have, been, in, use, from, the, 5th, to, 8th, centuries, and, contained, a, big, mosaic, on, the, floor, with, drawings, of, the, ark, of, the, covenant, the, menorah, a, shofar, and, a, lulav, nearby, in, naaran, there, is, another,

508, 509, it, is, very, similar, to, that, of, the, synagogue, at, maon, menois, and, the, christian, church, at, shellal, suggesting, that, the, same, artist, most, probably, worked, at, all, three,

were, excavated, in, a, qatabanian, from, the, late, 3rd, century, those, two, plates, formed, geometric, and, grapevines, formation, reflecting, the, traditions, of, that, culture, in, the, ghassanid, era, religious, mosaic, art, flourished, in, their, territory, so, far, five, churches, with, mosaic, were, recorded, from, that, era, two, built, by, ghassanid, rulers, and, the, other, three, by, the, christian, arab, community, who, wrote, their, names, and, dedications, tilework, had, been, known, there, for, about, two, thousand, years, when, cultural, exchange, between,

of, life, flanked, by, good, animals, on, one, side, and, bad, animals, on, the, other, among, the, hallabat, representations, are, vine, scrolls, grapes, pomegranates, oryx, wolves, hares, a, leopard, pairs, of, partridges, fish, bulls, ostriches, rabbits, rams, goats, lions, and, a, snake, at, qastal, near, amman, excavations, in, 2000, uncovered, the, earliest, known, umayyad, mosaics, in, present, day, jordan, dating, probably, from, the, caliphate, of, abd, al, malik, ibn, marwan, 685, 705, they, cover, much, of, the, floor, of, a, finely, decorated, building, that, probably, served, as, the, palace, of, a, local, governor, the, qastal, mosaics, depict, geometrical, patterns, trees, animals, fruits, and, rosettes, except, for, the, open, courtyard, entrance, and, staircases, the, floors, of, the, entire, palace, were, covered, in, mosaics, some, of, the, best, examples, of, later, islamic, mosaics, were, produced, in, moorish, spain, the, golden, mosaics, in, the, mihrab, and, the, central, dome, of, the, great, mosque, in, corduba, have, a, decidedly, byzantine, character, they, were, made, between, 965, and, 970, by, local, craftsmen, supervised, by, a, master, mosaicist, from, constantinople, who, was, sent, by, the, byzantine, emperor, to, the, umayyad, caliph, of, spain, the, decoration, is, composed, of, colorful, floral, arabesques, and, wide, bands, of, arab, calligraphy, the, mosaics, were, purported, to, evoke, the, glamour, of, the, great, mosque, in, damascus, which, was, lost, for, the, umayyad, family, mosaics, generally, went, out, of, fashion, in, the, islamic, world, after, the, 8th, century, similar, effects, were, achieved, by, the, use, of, painted, tilework, either, geometric, with, small, tiles, sometimes, called, mosaic, like, the, zillij, of, north, africa, or, larger, tiles, painted, with, parts, of, a, large, decorative, scheme, qashani, in, persia, turkey, and, further, east, noted, 19th, century, mosaics, include, those, by, edward, burne, jones, at, st, pauls, within, the, walls, in, rome, another, modern, mosaic, of, note, is, the, world, s, largest, mosaic, installation, located, at, the, cathedral, basilica, of, st, louis, located, in, st, louis, missouri, a, modern, example, of, mosaic, is, the, museum, of, natural, history, station, of, the, new, york, city, subway, there, are, many, such, works, of, art, scattered, throughout, the, new, york, city, subway, system, though, many, ind, stations, are, usually, designed, with, bland, mosaics, another, example, of, mosaics, in, ordinary, surroundings, is, the, use, of, locally, themed, mosaics, in, some, restrooms, in, the, rest, areas, along, some, texas, interstate, highways, some, modern, mosaics, are, the, work, of, modernisme, style, architects, antoni, gaud, and, josep, maria, jujol, for, example, the, mosaics, in, the, park, g, ell, in, barcelona, today, among, the, leading, figures, of, the, mosaic, world, are, elaine, m, goodwin, uk, felice, nittolo, italy, brit, hammer, netherlands, dugald, macinnes, scotland, heather, hancock, usa, kelley, knickerbocker, usa, aida, valencia, mexico, emma, biggs, uk, helen, nock, uk, marcelo, de, melo, brazil, sonia, king, usa, and, saimir, strati, albania, mosaics, have, developed, into, a, popular, craft, and, art, and, are, not, limited, to, professionals, today, s, artisans, and, crafters, work, with, stone, ceramics, smalti, shells, art, glass, mirror, beads, and, even, odd, items, like, doll, parts, pearls, or, photographs, while, ancient, mosaics, tended, to, be, architectural, modern, mosaics, are, found, covering, everything, from, park, benches, and, flowerpots, to, guitars, and, bicycles, items, can, be, as, small, as, an, earring, or, as, large, as, a, house, trencad, s, or, pique, assiette, a, french, term, stolen, from, plate, is, a, mosaic, made, from, pieces, of, broken, pottery, china, glass, buttons, figurines, or, jewelry, which, are, cemented, onto, a, base, to, create, a, new, surface, almost, any, form, can, be, used, as, a, base, and, any, combination, of, pieces, can, be, applied, restricted, only, by, the, individual, creator, s, imagination, in, styles, that, owe, as, much, to, videogame, pixel, art, and, pop, culture, as, to, traditional, mosaic, street, art, has, seen, a, novel, reinvention, and, expansion, of, mosaic, artwork, the, most, prominent, artist, working, with, mosaics, in, street, art, is, the, french, invader, he, has, done, almost, all, his, work, in, two, very, distinct, mosaic, styles, the, first, of, which, are, small, traditional, tile, mosaics, of, 8, bit, video, game, character, installed, in, cities, across, the, globe, and, the, second, of, which, are, a, style, he, refers, to, as, rubikcubism, which, uses, a, kind, of, dual, layer, mosaic, via, grids, of, scrambled, rubik, s, cubes, although, he, is, the, most, prominent, other, street, and, urban, artists, do, work, in, mosaic, styles, as, well, portuguese, pavement, in, portuguese, cal, ada, portuguesa, is, a, kind, of, two, tone, stone, mosaic, paving, created, in, portugal, and, common, throughout, the, lusosphere, most, commonly, taking, the, form, of, geometric, patterns, from, the, simple, to, the, complex, it, also, is, used, to, create, complex, pictorial, mosaics, in, styles, ranging, from, iconography, to, classicism, and, even, modern, design, in, portuguese, speaking, countries, many, cities, have, a, large, amount, of, their, sidewalks, and, even, though, far, more, occasionally, streets, done, in, this, mosaic, form, lisbon, in, particular, maintains, almost, all, walkways, in, this, style, despite, its, prevalence, and, popularity, throughout, portugal, and, its, former, colonies, and, its, relation, to, older, art, and, architectural, styles, like, azulejo, portuguese, and, spanish, painted, tilework, it, is, a, relatively, young, mosaic, artform, its, first, definitive, appearance, in, a, modernly, recognizable, form, being, in, the, mid, 1800s, among, the, most, commonly, used, stones, in, this, style, are, basalt, and, limestone, mosaic, is, an, art, form, which, uses, small, pieces, of, materials, placed, together, to, create, a, unified, whole, the, materials, commonly, used, are, marble, or, other, stone, glass, pottery, mirror, or, foil, backed, glass, or, shells, the, word, mosaic, is, from, the, italian, mosaico, deriving, from, the, latin, mosaicus, and, ultimately, from, the, greek, mouseios, meaning, belonging, to, the, muses, hence, artistic, each, piece, of, material, is, a, tessera, plural, tesserae, the, space, in, between, where, the, grout, goes, is, an, interstice, andamento, is, the, word, used, to, describe, the, movement, and, flow, of, tesserae, the, opus, the, latin, for, work, is, the, way, in, which, the, pieces, are, cut, and, placed, common, techniques, include, there, are, three, main, methods, the, direct, method, the, indirect, method, and, the, double, indirect, method, the, direct, method, of, mosaic, construction, involves, directly, placing, gluing, the, individual, tesserae, onto, the, supporting, surface, this, method, is, well, suited, to, surfaces, that, have, a, three, dimensional, quality, such, as, vases, this, was, used, for, the, historic, european, wall, and, ceiling, mosaics, following, underdrawings, of, the, main, outlines, on, the, wall, below, which, are, often, revealed, again, when, the, mosaic, falls, away, the, direct, method, suits, small, projects, that, are, transportable, another, advantage, of, the, direct, method, is, that, the, resulting, mosaic, is, progressively, visible, allowing, for, any, adjustments, to, tile, color, or, placement, the, disadvantage, of, the, direct, method, is, that, the, artist, must, work, directly, at, the, chosen, surface, which, is, often, not, practical, for, long, periods, of, time, especially, for, large, scale, projects, also, it, is, difficult, to, control, the, evenness, of, the, finished, surface, this, is, of, particular, importance, when, creating, a, functional, surface, such, as, a, floor, or, a, table, top, a, modern, version, of, the, direct, method, sometimes, called, double, direct, is, to, work, directly, onto, fiberglass, mesh, the, mosaic, can, then, be, constructed, with, the, design, visible, on, the, surface, and, transported, to, its, final, location, large, work, can, be, done, in, this, way, with, the, mosaic, being, cut, up, for, shipping, and, then, reassembled, for, installation, it, enables, the, artist, to, work, in, comfort, in, a, studio, rather, than, at, the, site, of, installation, the, indirect, method, of, applying, tesserae, is, often, used, for, very, large, projects, projects, with, repetitive, elements, or, for, areas, needing, site, specific, shapes, tesserae, are, applied, face, down, to, a, backing, paper, using, a, water, soluble, adhesive, once, the, mosaic, is, completed, in, the, studio, it, is, transferred, in, sections, to, the, site, and, cemented, paper, facing, outwards, once, fixed, the, paper, is, dampened, and, removed, this, method, is, most, useful, for, extremely, large, projects, as, it, gives, the, maker, time, to, rework, areas, allows, the, cementing, of, the, tesserae, to, the, backing, panel, to, be, carried, out, quickly, in, one, operation, and, helps, ensure, that, the, front, surfaces, of, the, mosaic, tiles, and, mosaic, pieces, are, flat, and, in, the, same, plane, on, the, front, even, when, using, tiles, and, pieces, of, differing, thicknesses, mosaic, murals, benches, and, tabletops, are, some, of, the, items, usually, made, using, the, indirect, method, as, it, results, in, a, smoother, and, more, even, surface, the, best, way, to, arrange, variously, shaped, tiles, on, a, surface, leads, to, the, mathematical, field, of, tessellation, the, artist, m, c, escher, was, influenced, by, moorish, mosaics, to, begin, his, investigations, into, tessellation, a, photomosaic, is, a, picture, made, up, of, various, other, pictures, pioneered, by, joseph, francis, in, which, each, pixel, is, another, picture, when, examined, closely, this, form, has, been, adopted, in, many, modern, media, and, digital, image, searches, a, tile, mosaic, is, a, digital, image, made, up, of, individual, tiles, arranged, in, a, non, overlapping, fashion, e, g, to, make, a, static, image, on, a, shower, room, or, bathing, pool, floor, by, breaking, the, image, down, into, square, pixels, formed, from, ceramic, tiles, a, typical, size, is, 1, in, 1, in, 25, mm, 25, mm, as, for, example, on, the, floor, of, the, university, of, toronto, pool, though, sometimes, larger, tiles, such, as, 2, in, 2, in, 51, mm, 51, mm, are, used, these, digital, images, are, coarse, in, resolution, and, often, simply, express, text, such, as, the, depth, of, the, pool, in, various, places, but, some, such, digital, images, are, used, to, show, a, sunset, or, other, beach, theme, recent, developments, in, digital, image, processing, have, led, to, the, ability, to, design, physical, tile, mosaics, using, computer, aided, design, cad, software, the, software, typically, takes, as, inputs, a, source, bitmap, and, a, palette, of, colored, tiles, the, software, makes, a, best, fit, match, of, the, tiles, to, the, source, image, in, order, to, place, tiles, in, the, manner, of, opus, vermiculatum, the, first, step, is, to, find, edges, of, visually, important, objects, in, the, image, a, python, implementation, of, a, complete, pixel, image, to, mosaic, vector, image, algorithm, is, available, with, high, cost, of, labor, in, developed, countries, production, automation, has, become, increasingly, popular, rather, than, being, assembled, by, hand, mosaics, designed, using, computer, aided, design, cad, software, can, be, assembled, by, a, robot, production, can, be, greater, than, 10, times, faster, with, higher, accuracy, but, these, computer, mosaics, have, a, different, look, than, hand, made, artisanal, mosaics, with, robotic, production, colored, tiles, are, loaded, into, buffers, and, then, the, robot, picks, and, places, tiles, individually, according, to, a, command, file, from, the, design, software
