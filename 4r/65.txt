november, 7, 1929, nine, days, after, the, wall, street, crash, abby, rockefeller, had, invited, a, conger, goodyear, the, former, president, of, the, board, of, trustees, of, the, albright, art,

the, first, of, its, kind, in, manhattan, to, exhibit, european, modernism, one, of, rockefeller, s, early, recruits, for, the, museum, staff, was, the, noted, japanese, american, photographer,

s, husband, john, d, rockefeller, jr, was, adamantly, opposed, to, the, museum, as, well, as, to, modern, art, itself, and, refused, to, release, funds, for, the, venture, which, had, to, be, obtained, from, other, sources, and, resulted, in, the, frequent, shifts, of, location, nevertheless, he, eventually, donated, the, land, for, the, current, site, of, the, museum, plus, other, gifts, over, time, and, thus, became, in, effect, one, of, its, greatest, benefactors, during, that, time, the, museum, initiated, many, more, exhibitions, of, noted, artists, such, as, the, lone, vincent, van, gogh, exhibition, on, november, 4, 1935, containing, an, unprecedented, 66, oils, and, 50, drawings, from, the, netherlands, as, well, as, poignant, excerpts, from, the, artist, s, letters, it, was, a, major, public, success, due, to, barr, s, arrangement, of, the, exhibit, and, became, a, precursor, to, the, hold, van, gogh, has, to, this, day, on, the, contemporary, imagination, the, museum, also, gained, international, prominence, with, the, hugely, successful, and, now, famous, picasso, retrospective, of, 1939, 40, held, in, conjunction, with, the, art, institute, of, chicago, in, its, range, of, presented, works, it, represented, a, significant, reinterpretation, of, picasso, for, future, art, scholars, and, historians, this, was, wholly, masterminded, by, barr, a, picasso, enthusiast, and, the, exhibition, lionized, picasso, as, the, greatest, artist, of, the, time, setting, the, model, for, all, the, museum, s, retrospectives, that, were, to, follow, boy,
