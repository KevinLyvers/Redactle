the, rime, of, the, ancient, mariner, originally, the, rime, of, the, ancyent, marinere, is, the, longest, major, poem, by, english, poet, samuel, taylor, coleridge, written, in, 1797, 98, and, published, in, 1798, in, the, first, edition, of, lyrical, ballads, some, modern, editions, use, a, revised, version, printed, in, 1817, that, featured, a, gloss, it, is, often, considered, a, signal, shift, to, modern, poetry, and, the, beginning, of, british, romantic, literature, the, rime, of, the, ancient, mariner, recounts, the, experiences, of, a, sailor, who, has, returned, from, a, long, sea, voyage, the, mariner, stops, a, man, who, is, on, his, way, to, a, wedding, ceremony, and, begins, to, narrate, a, story, the, wedding, guest, s, reaction, turns, from, amusement, to, impatience, to, fear, to, fascination, as, the, mariner, s, story, progresses, as, can, be, seen, in, the, language, style, coleridge, uses, narrative, techniques, such, as, personification, and, repetition, to, create, a, sense, of, danger, the, supernatural, or, serenity, depending, on, the, mood, in, different, parts, of, the, poem, the, poem, begins, with, an, old, grey, bearded, sailor, the, mariner, stopping, a, guest, at, a, wedding, ceremony, to, tell, him, a, story, of, a, sailing, voyage, he, took, long, ago, the, wedding, guest, is, at, first, reluctant, to, listen, as, the, ceremony, is, about, to, begin, but, the, mariner, s, glittering, eye, captivates, him, the, mariner, s, tale, begins, with, his, ship, departing, on, its, journey, despite, initial, good, fortune, the, ship, is, driven, south, by, a, storm, and, eventually, reaches, the, icy, waters, of, the, antarctic, an, albatross, appears, and, leads, the, ship, out, of, the, ice, jam, where, it, is, stuck, but, even, as, the, albatross, is, fed, and, praised, by, the, ship, s, crew, the, mariner, shoots, the, bird, with, my, cross, bow, i, shot, the, albatross, the, crew, is, angry, with, the, mariner, believing, the, albatross, brought, the, south, wind, that, led, them, out, of, the, antarctic, however, the, sailors, change, their, minds, when, the, weather, becomes, warmer, and, the, mist, disappears, twas, right, said, they, such, birds, to, slay, that, bring, the, fog, and, mist, they, soon, find, that, they, made, a, grave, mistake, in, supporting, this, crime, as, it, arouses, the, wrath, of, spirits, who, then, pursue, the, ship, from, the, land, of, mist, and, snow, the, south, wind, that, had, initially, blown, them, north, now, sends, the, ship, into, uncharted, waters, near, the, equator, where, it, is, becalmed, day, after, day, day, after, day, we, stuck, nor, breath, nor, motion, as, idle, as, a, painted, ship, upon, a, painted, ocean, water, water, every, where, and, all, the, boards, did, shrink, water, water, every, where, nor, any, drop, to, drink, the, very, deep, did, rot, oh, christ, that, ever, this, should, be, yea, slimy, things, did, crawl, with, legs, upon, the, slimy, sea, the, sailors, change, their, minds, again, and, blame, the, mariner, for, the, torment, of, their, thirst, in, anger, the, crew, forces, the, mariner, to, wear, the, dead, albatross, about, his, neck, perhaps, to, illustrate, the, burden, he, must, suffer, from, killing, it, or, perhaps, as, a, sign, of, regret, ah, well, a, day, what, evil, looks, had, i, from, old, and, young, instead, of, the, cross, the, albatross, about, my, neck, was, hung, after, a, weary, time, the, ship, encounters, a, ghostly, hulk, on, board, are, death, a, skeleton, and, the, night, mare, life, in, death, a, deathly, pale, woman, who, are, playing, dice, for, the, souls, of, the, crew, with, a, roll, of, the, dice, death, wins, the, lives, of, the, crew, members, and, life, in, death, the, life, of, the, mariner, a, prize, she, considers, more, valuable, her, name, is, a, clue, to, the, mariner, s, fate, he, will, endure, a, fate, worse, than, death, as, punishment, for, his, killing, of, the, albatross, one, by, one, all, of, the, crew, members, die, but, the, mariner, lives, on, seeing, for, seven, days, and, nights, the, curse, in, the, eyes, of, the, crew, s, corpses, whose, last, expressions, remain, upon, their, faces, four, times, fifty, living, men, and, i, heard, nor, sigh, nor, groan, with, heavy, thump, a, lifeless, lump, they, dropped, down, one, by, one, the, souls, did, from, their, bodies, fly, they, fled, to, bliss, or, woe, and, every, soul, it, passed, me, by, like, the, whizz, of, my, cross, bow, eventually, this, stage, of, the, mariner, s, curse, is, lifted, after, he, begins, to, appreciate, the, many, sea, creatures, swimming, in, the, water, despite, his, cursing, them, as, slimy, things, earlier, in, the, poem, he, suddenly, sees, their, true, beauty, and, blesses, them, a, spring, of, love, gush, d, from, my, heart, and, i, bless, d, them, unaware, as, he, manages, to, pray, the, albatross, falls, from, his, neck, and, his, guilt, is, partially, expiated, it, then, starts, to, rain, and, the, bodies, of, the, crew, possessed, by, good, spirits, rise, again, and, help, steer, the, ship, in, a, trance, the, mariner, hears, two, spirits, discussing, his, voyage, and, penance, and, learns, that, the, ship, is, being, powered, supernaturally, the, air, is, cut, away, before, and, closes, from, behind, finally, the, mariner, wakes, from, his, trance, and, comes, in, sight, of, his, homeland, but, is, initially, uncertain, as, to, whether, or, not, he, is, hallucinating, oh, dream, of, joy, is, this, indeed, the, light, house, top, i, see, is, this, the, hill, is, this, the, kirk, is, this, mine, own, countree, we, drifted, o, er, the, harbour, bar, and, i, with, sobs, did, pray, o, let, me, be, awake, my, god, or, let, me, sleep, alway, the, rotten, remains, of, the, ship, sink, in, a, whirlpool, leaving, only, the, mariner, behind, a, hermit, on, the, mainland, who, has, spotted, the, approaching, ship, comes, to, meet, it, in, a, boat, rowed, by, a, pilot, and, his, boy, when, they, pull, the, mariner, from, the, water, they, think, he, is, dead, but, when, he, opens, his, mouth, the, pilot, shrieks, with, fright, the, hermit, prays, and, the, mariner, picks, up, the, oars, to, row, the, pilot, s, boy, laughs, thinking, the, mariner, is, the, devil, and, cries, the, devil, knows, how, to, row, back, on, land, the, mariner, is, compelled, by, a, woful, agony, to, tell, the, hermit, his, story, as, penance, for, shooting, the, albatross, the, mariner, driven, by, the, agony, of, his, guilt, is, now, forced, to, wander, the, earth, telling, his, story, over, and, over, and, teaching, a, lesson, to, those, he, meets, he, prayeth, best, who, loveth, best, all, things, both, great, and, small, for, the, dear, god, who, loveth, us, he, made, and, loveth, all, after, finishing, his, story, the, mariner, leaves, and, the, wedding, guest, returns, home, waking, the, next, morning, a, sadder, and, a, wiser, man, the, poem, received, mixed, reviews, from, critics, and, coleridge, was, once, told, by, the, publisher, that, most, of, the, book, s, sales, were, to, sailors, who, thought, it, was, a, naval, songbook, coleridge, made, several, modifications, to, the, poem, over, the, years, in, the, second, edition, of, lyrical, ballads, published, in, 1800, he, replaced, many, of, the, archaic, words, the, poem, may, have, been, inspired, by, james, cook, s, second, voyage, of, exploration, 1772, 1775, of, the, south, seas, and, the, pacific, ocean, coleridge, s, tutor, william, wales, was, the, astronomer, on, cook, s, flagship, and, had, a, strong, relationship, with, cook, on, this, second, voyage, cook, crossed, three, times, into, the, antarctic, circle, to, determine, whether, the, fabled, great, southern, continent, terra, australis, existed, critics, have, also, suggested, that, the, poem, may, have, been, inspired, by, the, voyage, of, thomas, james, into, the, arctic, according, to, wordsworth, the, poem, was, inspired, while, coleridge, wordsworth, and, wordsworth, s, sister, dorothy, were, on, a, walking, tour, through, the, quantock, hills, in, somerset, the, discussion, had, turned, to, a, book, that, wordsworth, was, reading, that, described, a, privateering, voyage, in, 1719, during, which, a, melancholy, sailor, simon, hatley, shot, a, black, albatross, ah, well, a, day, what, evil, looks, had, i, from, old, and, young, instead, of, the, cross, the, albatross, about, my, neck, was, hung, lines, 139, 142, as, they, discussed, shelvocke, s, book, wordsworth, proffered, the, following, developmental, critique, to, coleridge, which, importantly, contains, a, reference, to, tutelary, spirits, suppose, you, represent, him, as, having, killed, one, of, these, birds, on, entering, the, south, sea, and, the, tutelary, spirits, of, these, regions, take, upon, them, to, avenge, the, crime, by, the, time, the, trio, finished, their, walk, the, poem, had, taken, shape, bernard, martin, argues, in, the, ancient, mariner, and, the, authentic, narrative, that, coleridge, was, also, influenced, by, the, life, of, anglican, clergyman, john, newton, who, had, a, near, death, experience, aboard, a, slave, ship, the, poem, may, also, have, been, inspired, by, the, legends, of, the, wandering, jew, who, was, forced, to, wander, the, earth, until, judgement, day, for, a, terrible, crime, found, in, charles, maturin, s, melmoth, the, wanderer, m, g, lewis, the, monk, a, 1796, novel, coleridge, reviewed, and, the, legend, of, the, flying, dutchman, it, is, argued, that, the, harbour, at, watchet, in, somerset, was, the, primary, inspiration, for, the, poem, although, some, time, before, john, cruikshank, a, local, acquaintance, of, coleridge, s, had, related, a, dream, about, a, skeleton, ship, crewed, by, spectral, sailors, in, september, 2003, a, commemorative, statue, by, alan, b, herriot, of, penicuik, scotland, was, unveiled, at, watchet, harbour, in, biographia, literaria, coleridge, wrote, the, thought, suggested, itself, to, which, of, us, i, do, not, recollect, that, a, series, of, poems, might, be, composed, of, two, sorts, in, the, one, incidents, and, agents, were, to, be, in, part, at, least, supernatural, and, the, excellence, aimed, at, was, to, consist, in, the, interesting, of, the, affections, by, the, dramatic, truth, of, such, emotions, as, would, naturally, accompany, such, situations, supposing, them, real, and, real, in, this, sense, they, have, been, to, every, human, being, who, from, whatever, source, of, delusion, has, at, any, time, believed, himself, under, supernatural, agency, for, the, second, class, subjects, were, to, be, chosen, from, ordinary, life, in, this, idea, originated, the, plan, of, the, lyrical, ballads, in, which, it, was, agreed, that, my, endeavours, should, be, directed, to, persons, and, characters, supernatural, or, at, least, romantic, yet, so, as, to, transfer, from, our, inward, nature, a, human, interest, and, a, semblance, of, truth, sufficient, to, procure, for, these, shadows, of, imagination, that, willing, suspension, of, disbelief, for, the, moment, which, constitutes, poetic, faith, with, this, view, i, wrote, the, ancient, mariner, in, table, talk, coleridge, wrote, mrs, barbauld, once, told, me, that, she, admired, the, ancient, mariner, very, much, but, that, there, were, two, faults, in, it, it, was, improbable, and, had, no, moral, as, for, the, probability, i, owned, that, that, might, admit, some, question, but, as, to, the, want, of, a, moral, i, told, her, that, in, my, own, judgement, the, poem, had, too, much, and, that, the, only, or, chief, fault, if, i, might, say, so, was, the, obtrusion, of, the, moral, sentiment, so, openly, on, the, reader, as, a, principle, or, cause, of, action, in, a, work, of, such, pure, imagination, it, ought, to, have, had, no, more, moral, than, the, arabian, nights, tale, of, the, merchant, s, sitting, down, to, eat, dates, by, the, side, of, a, well, and, throwing, the, shells, aside, and, lo, a, genie, starts, up, and, says, he, must, kill, the, aforesaid, merchant, because, one, of, the, date, shells, had, it, seems, put, out, the, eye, of, the, genie, s, son, wordsworth, wrote, to, joseph, cottle, in, 1799, from, what, i, can, gather, it, seems, that, the, ancient, mariner, has, upon, the, whole, been, an, injury, to, the, volume, i, mean, that, the, old, words, and, the, strangeness, of, it, have, deterred, readers, from, going, on, if, the, volume, should, come, to, a, second, edition, i, would, put, in, its, place, some, little, things, which, would, be, more, likely, to, suit, the, common, taste, however, when, lyrical, ballads, was, reprinted, wordsworth, included, it, despite, coleridge, s, objections, writing, the, poem, of, my, friend, has, indeed, great, defects, first, that, the, principal, person, has, no, distinct, character, either, in, his, profession, of, mariner, or, as, a, human, being, who, having, been, long, under, the, control, of, supernatural, impressions, might, be, supposed, himself, to, partake, of, something, supernatural, secondly, that, he, does, not, act, but, is, continually, acted, upon, thirdly, that, the, events, having, no, necessary, connection, do, not, produce, each, other, and, lastly, that, the, imagery, is, somewhat, too, laboriously, accumulated, yet, the, poem, contains, many, delicate, touches, of, passion, and, indeed, the, passion, is, every, where, true, to, nature, a, great, number, of, the, stanzas, present, beautiful, images, and, are, expressed, with, unusual, felicity, of, language, and, the, versification, though, the, metre, is, itself, unfit, for, long, poems, is, harmonious, and, artfully, varied, exhibiting, the, utmost, powers, of, that, metre, and, every, variety, of, which, it, is, capable, it, therefore, appeared, to, me, that, these, several, merits, the, first, of, which, namely, that, of, the, passion, is, of, the, highest, kind, gave, to, the, poem, a, value, which, is, not, often, possessed, by, better, poems, upon, its, release, the, poem, was, criticized, for, being, obscure, and, difficult, to, read, the, use, of, archaic, spelling, of, words, was, seen, as, not, in, keeping, with, wordsworth, s, claims, of, using, common, language, criticism, was, renewed, again, in, 1815, 1816, when, coleridge, added, marginal, notes, to, the, poem, that, were, also, written, in, an, archaic, style, these, notes, or, glosses, placed, next, to, the, text, of, the, poem, ostensibly, interpret, the, verses, much, like, marginal, notes, found, in, the, bible, there, were, many, opinions, on, why, coleridge, inserted, the, gloss, charles, lamb, who, had, deeply, admired, the, original, for, its, attention, to, human, feeling, claimed, that, the, gloss, distanced, the, audience, from, the, narrative, weakening, the, poem, s, effects, the, entire, poem, was, first, published, in, the, collection, of, lyrical, ballads, another, version, of, the, poem, was, published, in, the, 1817, collection, entitled, sibylline, leaves, see, 1817, in, poetry, on, a, surface, level, the, poem, explores, a, violation, of, nature, and, the, resulting, psychological, effects, on, the, mariner, and, on, all, those, who, hear, him, according, to, jerome, mcgann, the, poem, is, like, a, salvation, story, the, poem, s, structure, is, multi, layered, text, based, on, coleridge, s, interest, in, higher, criticism, like, the, iliad, or, paradise, lost, or, any, great, historical, product, the, rime, is, a, work, of, trans, historical, rather, than, so, called, universal, significance, this, verbal, distinction, is, important, because, it, calls, attention, to, a, real, one, like, the, divine, comedy, or, any, other, poem, the, rime, is, not, valued, or, used, always, or, everywhere, or, by, everyone, in, the, same, way, or, for, the, same, reasons, whalley, 1947, suggests, that, the, ancient, mariner, is, an, autobiographical, portrait, of, coleridge, himself, comparing, the, mariner, s, loneliness, with, coleridge, s, own, feelings, of, loneliness, expressed, in, his, letters, and, journals, in, sexual, personae, art, and, decadence, from, nefertiti, to, emily, dickinson, 1990, camille, paglia, writes, that, the, bridegroom, wedding, guest, and, mariner, all, represent, aspects, of, coleridge, the, bridegroom, is, a, masculine, persona, that, is, integrated, with, society, and, that, the, wedding, guest, is, an, adolescent, seeking, sexual, fulfilment, and, collective, joy, that, must, merge, with, the, bridegroom, but, is, unable, to, because, of, the, appearance, of, a, spectre, self, a, male, heroine, who, luxuriates, in, passive, suffering, coleridge, often, made, changes, to, his, poems, and, the, rime, of, the, ancient, mariner, was, no, exception, he, produced, at, least, eighteen, different, versions, over, the, years, pp, 128, 130, he, regarded, revision, as, an, essential, part, of, creating, poetry, p, 138, the, first, published, version, of, the, poem, was, in, lyrical, ballads, in, 1798, the, second, edition, of, this, anthology, in, 1800, included, a, revised, text, requested, by, coleridge, in, which, some, of, the, language, and, many, of, the, archaic, spellings, were, modernised, he, also, reduced, the, title, to, the, ancient, mariner, but, for, later, versions, the, longer, title, was, restored, the, 1802, and, 1805, editions, of, lyrical, ballads, had, minor, textual, changes, in, 1817, coleridge, s, sibylline, leaves, anthology, included, a, new, version, with, an, extensive, marginal, gloss, written, by, the, poet, the, last, version, he, produced, was, in, 1834, pp, 127, 130, 134, traditionally, literary, critics, regarded, each, revision, of, a, text, by, an, author, as, producing, a, more, authoritative, version, and, coleridge, published, somewhat, revised, versions, of, the, poem, in, his, poetical, works, anthology, editions, of, 1828, 1829, and, lastly, in, 1834, the, year, of, his, death, more, recently, scholars, look, to, the, earliest, version, even, in, manuscript, as, the, most, authoritative, but, for, this, poem, no, manuscript, is, extant, hence, the, editors, of, the, edition, of, collected, poems, published, in, 1972, used, the, 1798, version, but, made, their, own, modernisation, of, the, spelling, and, they, added, some, passages, taken, from, later, editions, pp, 128, 129, 134, the, 1817, edition, the, one, most, used, today, and, the, first, to, be, published, under, coleridge, s, own, name, rather, than, anonymously, added, a, new, latin, epigraph, but, the, major, change, was, the, addition, of, the, gloss, that, has, a, considerable, effect, on, the, way, the, poem, reads, p, 186, pp, 130, 134, coleridge, s, grandson, e, h, coleridge, produced, a, detailed, study, of, the, published, versions, of, the, poem, over, all, coleridge, s, revisions, resulted, in, the, poem, losing, thirty, nine, lines, and, an, introductory, prose, argument, and, gaining, fifty, eight, glosses, and, a, latin, epigraph, p, 134, in, general, the, anthologies, included, printed, lists, of, errata, and, in, the, case, of, the, particularly, lengthy, list, in, sibylline, leaves, the, list, was, included, at, the, beginning, of, the, volume, such, changes, were, often, editorial, rather, than, merely, correcting, errors, pp, 131, 139, coleridge, also, made, handwritten, changes, in, printed, volumes, of, his, work, particularly, when, he, presented, them, as, gifts, to, friends, pp, 134, 139, in, addition, to, being, referred, to, in, several, other, notable, works, due, to, the, popularity, of, the, poem, the, phrase, albatross, around, one, s, neck, has, become, an, english, language, idiom, referring, to, a, heavy, burden, of, guilt, that, becomes, an, obstacle, to, success, the, phrase, water, water, every, where, nor, any, drop, to, drink, has, appeared, widely, in, popular, culture, but, usually, given, in, a, more, natural, modern, phrasing, as, water, water, everywhere, but, not, a, drop, to, drink, some, such, appearances, have, in, turn, played, on, the, frequency, with, which, these, lines, are, misquoted
