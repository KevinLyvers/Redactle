state, building, khan, s, contributions, to, the, design, of, tall, buildings, have, had, a, profound, impact, on, architecture, and, engineering, it, would, be, difficult, to, find, any, worldwide, practices, in, the, design, of, tall, buildings, that, have, not, been, directly, or, indirectly, influenced, by, his, work, the, design, is, reminiscent, of, frank, lloyd, wright, s, vision, for, the, illinois, a, mile, high, skyscraper, designed, for, chicago, as, well, as, chicago, s, lake, point, tower, when, adrian, smith, was, conceiving, the, project, at, som, he, looked, out, his,

short, tons, 54, 000, long, tons, of, steel, rebar, and, construction, took, 22, million, man, hours, in, may, 2008, putzmeister, pumped, concrete, with, more, than, 21, mpa, ultimate, compressive, strength, of, gravel, to, surpass, the, 600, metres, weight, of, the, effective, area, of, each, column, from, the, foundation, to, the, next, 4th, level, and, the, rest, was, by, metal, columns, jacketed, or, covered, with, concrete, to, a, then, world, record, delivery, height, of, 606, m, 1, 988, ft, the, 156th, floor, three, tower, cranes, were, used, during, the, construction, of, the, uppermost, levels, each, capable, of, lifting, a, 25, tonne, load, the, remaining, structure, above, was, constructed, of, lighter, steel, in, 2003, 33, test, holes, were, drilled, to, study, the, strength, of, the, bedrock, underlying, the, structure, weak, to, very, weak, sandstone, and, siltstone, was, found, just, metres, below, the, surface, samples, were, taken, from, test, holes, drilled, to, a, depth, of, 140, metres, finding, weak, to, very, weak, rock, all, the, way, the, study, described, the, site, as, part, of, a, seismically, active, area, another, challenging, element, was, the, shamal, which, often, creates, sandstorms, over, 45, 000, m, 3, 58, 900, cu, yd, of, concrete, weighing, more, than, 110, 000, tonnes, 120, 000, short, tons, 110, 000, long, tons, were, used, to, construct, the, concrete, and, steel, foundation, which, features, 192, piles, each, pile, is, 1, 5, metre, in, diameter, by, 43, m, in, length, buried, more, than, 50, m, 164, ft, deep, the, foundation, was, designed, to, support, the, total, building, weight, of, approximately, 450, 000, tonnes, 500, 000, short, tons, 440, 000, long, tons, this, weight, was, then, divided, by, the, compressive, strength, of, concrete, which, is, 30, mpa, which, yielded, 450, sq, metres, of, vertical, normal, effective, area, which, then, yielded, 12, metres, by, 12, metres, dimensions, a, cathodic, protection, system, is, under, the, concrete, to, neutralise, the, sulphate, and, chloride, rich, groundwater, and, prevent, corrosion, during, the, construction, of, the, burj, khalifa, over, 35, 000, tonnes, of, structural, steel, which, held, the, palace, of, the, republic, the, former, parliament, building, of, the, german, democratic, republic, the, volkskammer, in, east, berlin, together, were, shipped, to, dubai, in, 2008, the, burj, khalifa, is, highly, compartmentalised, pressurised, air, conditioned, refuge, floors, are, located, every, 13, floors, on, floors, g, 13, 26, 39, 52, etc, where, people, can, shelter, on, their, long, walk, down, to, safety, in, case, of, an, emergency, or, fire, special, mixes, of, concrete, were, made, to, withstand, the, extreme, pressures, of, the, massive, building, weight, as, is, typical, with, reinforced, concrete, construction, each, batch, of, concrete, was, tested, to, ensure, it, could, withstand, certain, pressures, ctlgroup, working, for, skidmore, owings, and, merrill, conducted, the, creep, and, shrinkage, testing, critical, for, the, structural, analysis, of, the, building, the, consistency, of, the, concrete, used, in, the, project, was, essential, it, was, difficult, to, create, a, concrete, that, could, withstand, both, the, thousands, of, tonnes, bearing, down, on, it, and, persian, gulf, temperatures, that, can, reach, 50, c, 122, f, to, combat, this, problem, the, concrete, was, not, poured, during, the, day, instead, during, the, summer, months, ice, was, added, to, the, mixture, and, it, was, poured, at, night, when, the, air, was, cooler, and, the, humidity, was, higher, cooler, concrete, cures, more, evenly, and, is, therefore, less, likely, to, set, too, quickly, and, crack, any, significant, cracks, could, have, put, the, entire, project, in, jeopardy, in, march, 2009, mohamed, ali, alabbar, chairman, of, the, project, s, developer, emaar, properties, said, office, space, pricing, at, burj, khalifa, reached, us, 4, 000, per, sq, ft, over, us, 43, 000, per, m, 2, and, the, armani, residences, also, in, burj, khalifa, sold, for, us, 3, 500, per, sq, ft, over, us, 37, 500, per, m, 2, he, estimated, the, total, cost, for, the, project, to, be, about, us, 1, 5, billion, the, project, s, completion, coincided, with, the, financial, crisis, of, 2007, 2008, and, with, vast, overbuilding, in, the, country, leading, to, high, vacancies, and, foreclosures, with, dubai, mired, in, debt, from, its, huge, ambitions, the, government, was, forced, to, seek, multibillion, dollar, bailouts, from, its, oil, rich, neighbor, abu, dhabi, subsequently, in, a, surprise, move, at, its, opening, ceremony, the, tower, was, renamed, burj, khalifa, said, to, honour, the, uae, president, khalifa, bin, zayed, al, nahyan, for, his, crucial, support, because, of, the, slumping, demand, in, dubai, s, property, market, the, rents, in, the, burj, khalifa,
