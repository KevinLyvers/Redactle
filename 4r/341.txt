https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagpipes
bagpipes, are, a, woodwind, instrument, using, enclosed, reeds, fed, from, a, constant, reservoir, of, air, in, the, form, of, a, bag, the, great, highland, bagpipes, are, well, known, but, people, have, played, bagpipes, for, centuries, throughout, large, parts, of, europe, northern, africa, western, asia, around, the, persian, gulf, and, northern, parts, of, south, asia, the, term, bagpipe, is, equally, correct, in, the, singular, or, the, plural, though, pipers, usually, refer, to, the, bagpipes, as, the, pipes, a, set, of, pipes, or, a, stand, of, pipes, a, set, of, bagpipes, minimally, consists, of, an, air, supply, a, bag, a, chanter, and, usually, at, least, one, drone, many, bagpipes, have, more, than, one, drone, and, sometimes, more, than, one, chanter, in, various, combinations, held, in, place, in, stocks, sockets, that, fasten, the, various, pipes, to, the, bag, the, most, common, method, of, supplying, air, to, the, bag, is, through, blowing, into, a, blowpipe, or, blowstick, in, some, pipes, the, player, must, cover, the, tip, of, the, blowpipe, with, the, tongue, while, inhaling, in, order, to, prevent, unwanted, deflation, of, the, bag, but, most, blowpipes, have, a, non, return, valve, that, eliminates, this, need, in, recent, times, there, are, many, instruments, that, assist, in, creating, a, clean, air, flow, to, the, pipes, and, assist, the, collection, of, condensation, the, use, of, a, bellows, to, supply, air, is, an, innovation, dating, from, the, 16th, or, 17th, century, in, these, pipes, sometimes, called, cauld, wind, pipes, air, is, not, heated, or, moistened, by, the, player, s, breathing, so, bellows, driven, bagpipes, can, use, more, refined, or, delicate, reeds, such, pipes, include, the, irish, uilleann, pipes, the, border, or, lowland, pipes, scottish, smallpipes, northumbrian, smallpipes, and, pastoral, pipes, in, britain, the, musette, de, cour, the, musette, bechonnet, and, the, cabrette, in, france, and, the, dudy, koziol, bialy, and, koziol, czarny, in, poland, the, bag, is, an, airtight, reservoir, that, holds, air, and, regulates, its, flow, via, arm, pressure, allowing, the, player, to, maintain, continuous, even, sound, the, player, keeps, the, bag, inflated, by, blowing, air, into, it, through, a, blowpipe, or, by, pumping, air, into, it, with, a, bellows, materials, used, for, bags, vary, widely, but, the, most, common, are, the, skins, of, local, animals, such, as, goats, dogs, sheep, and, cows, more, recently, bags, made, of, synthetic, materials, including, gore, tex, have, become, much, more, common, some, synthetic, bags, have, zips, that, allow, the, player, to, fit, a, more, effective, moisture, trap, to, the, inside, of, the, bag, however, synthetic, bags, still, carry, a, risk, of, colonisation, by, fungal, spores, and, the, associated, danger, of, lung, infection, if, they, are, not, kept, clean, even, if, they, otherwise, require, less, cleaning, than, do, bags, made, from, natural, substances, bags, cut, from, larger, materials, are, usually, saddle, stitched, with, an, extra, strip, folded, over, the, seam, and, stitched, for, skin, bags, or, glued, for, synthetic, bags, to, reduce, leaks, holes, are, then, cut, to, accommodate, the, stocks, in, the, case, of, bags, made, from, largely, intact, animal, skins, the, stocks, are, typically, tied, into, the, points, where, the, limbs, and, the, head, joined, the, body, of, the, whole, animal, a, construction, technique, common, in, central, europe, different, regions, have, different, ways, of, treating, the, hide, the, simplest, methods, involve, just, the, use, of, salt, while, more, complex, treatments, involve, milk, flour, and, the, removal, of, fur, the, hide, is, normally, turned, inside, out, so, that, the, fur, is, on, the, inside, of, the, bag, as, this, helps, to, reduce, the, effect, of, moisture, buildup, within, the, bag, the, chanter, is, the, melody, pipe, played, with, two, hands, all, bagpipes, have, at, least, one, chanter, some, pipes, have, two, chanters, particularly, those, in, north, africa, in, the, balkans, and, in, southwest, asia, a, chanter, can, be, bored, internally, so, that, the, inside, walls, are, parallel, or, cylindrical, for, its, full, length, or, it, can, be, bored, in, a, conical, shape, popular, woods, include, boxwood, cornel, plum, or, other, fruit, wood, the, chanter, is, usually, open, ended, so, there, is, no, easy, way, for, the, player, to, stop, the, pipe, from, sounding, thus, most, bagpipes, share, a, constant, legato, sound, with, no, rests, in, the, music, primarily, because, of, this, inability, to, stop, playing, technical, movements, are, made, to, break, up, notes, and, to, create, the, illusion, of, articulation, and, accents, because, of, their, importance, these, embellishments, or, ornaments, are, often, highly, technical, systems, specific, to, each, bagpipe, and, take, many, years, of, study, to, master, a, few, bagpipes, such, as, the, musette, de, cour, the, uilleann, pipes, the, northumbrian, smallpipes, the, piva, and, the, left, chanter, of, the, surdelina, have, closed, ends, or, stop, the, end, on, the, player, s, leg, so, that, when, the, player, closes, covers, all, the, holes, the, chanter, becomes, silent, a, practice, chanter, is, a, chanter, without, bag, or, drones, and, has, a, much, quieter, reed, allowing, a, player, to, practice, the, instrument, quietly, and, with, no, variables, other, than, playing, the, chanter, the, term, chanter, is, derived, from, the, latin, cantare, or, to, sing, much, like, the, modern, french, verb, meaning, to, sing, chanter, a, distinctive, feature, of, the, gaida, s, chanter, which, it, shares, with, a, number, of, other, eastern, european, bagpipes, is, the, flea, hole, also, known, as, a, mumbler, or, voicer, marmorka, which, is, covered, by, the, index, finger, of, the, left, hand, the, flea, hole, is, smaller, than, the, rest, and, usually, consists, of, a, small, tube, that, is, made, out, of, metal, or, a, chicken, or, duck, feather, uncovering, the, flea, hole, raises, any, note, played, by, a, half, step, and, it, is, used, in, creating, the, musical, ornamentation, that, gives, balkan, music, its, unique, character, some, types, of, gaida, can, have, a, double, bored, chanter, such, as, the, serbian, three, voiced, gajde, it, has, eight, fingerholes, the, top, four, are, covered, by, the, thumb, and, the, first, three, fingers, of, the, left, hand, then, the, four, fingers, of, the, right, hand, cover, the, remaining, four, holes, the, note, from, the, chanter, is, produced, by, a, reed, installed, at, its, top, the, reed, may, be, a, single, a, reed, with, one, vibrating, tongue, or, double, reed, of, two, pieces, that, vibrate, against, each, other, double, reeds, are, used, with, both, conical, and, parallel, bored, chanters, while, single, reeds, are, generally, although, not, exclusively, limited, to, parallel, bored, chanters, in, general, double, reed, chanters, are, found, in, pipes, of, western, europe, while, single, reed, chanters, appear, in, most, other, regions, they, are, made, from, reed, arundo, donax, or, phragmites, bamboo, or, elder, a, more, modern, variant, for, the, reed, is, a, combination, of, a, cotton, phenolic, hgw2082, material, from, which, the, body, of, the, reed, is, made, and, a, clarinet, reed, cut, to, size, in, order, to, fit, the, body, these, type, of, reeds, produce, a, louder, sound, and, are, not, so, sensitive, to, humidity, and, temperature, changes, most, bagpipes, have, at, least, one, drone, a, pipe, that, generally, is, not, fingered, but, rather, produces, a, constant, harmonizing, note, throughout, play, usually, the, tonic, note, of, the, chanter, exceptions, are, generally, those, pipes, that, have, a, double, chanter, instead, a, drone, is, most, commonly, a, cylindrically, bored, tube, with, a, single, reed, although, drones, with, double, reeds, exist, the, drone, is, generally, designed, in, two, or, more, parts, with, a, sliding, joint, so, that, the, pitch, of, the, drone, can, be, adjusted, depending, on, the, type, of, pipes, the, drones, may, lie, over, the, shoulder, across, the, arm, opposite, the, bag, or, may, run, parallel, to, the, chanter, some, drones, have, a, tuning, screw, which, effectively, alters, the, length, of, the, drone, by, opening, a, hole, allowing, the, drone, to, be, tuned, to, two, or, more, distinct, pitches, the, tuning, screw, may, also, shut, off, the, drone, altogether, in, most, types, of, pipes, with, one, drone, it, is, pitched, two, octaves, below, the, tonic, of, the, chanter, additional, drones, often, add, the, octave, below, and, then, a, drone, consonant, with, the, fifth, of, the, chanter, the, evidence, for, bagpipes, prior, to, the, 13th, century, ad, is, still, uncertain, but, several, textual, and, visual, clues, have, been, suggested, the, oxford, history, of, music, posits, that, a, sculpture, of, bagpipes, has, been, found, on, a, hittite, slab, at, euyuk, in, anatolia, dated, to, 1000, bc, another, interpretation, of, this, sculpture, suggests, that, it, instead, depicts, a, pan, flute, played, along, with, a, friction, drum, several, authors, identify, the, ancient, greek, askaulos, askos, wine, skin, aulos, reed, pipe, with, the, bagpipe, in, the, 2nd, century, ad, suetonius, described, the, roman, emperor, nero, as, a, player, of, the, tibia, utricularis, dio, chrysostom, wrote, in, the, 1st, century, of, a, contemporary, sovereign, possibly, nero, who, could, play, a, pipe, tibia, roman, reedpipes, similar, to, greek, and, etruscan, instruments, with, his, mouth, as, well, as, by, tucking, a, bladder, beneath, his, armpit, vereno, suggests, that, such, instruments, rather, than, being, seen, as, an, independent, class, were, understood, as, variants, on, mouth, blown, instruments, that, used, a, bag, as, an, alternative, blowing, aid, and, that, it, was, not, until, drones, were, added, in, the, european, medieval, era, that, bagpipes, were, seen, as, a, distinct, class, in, the, early, part, of, the, second, millennium, representation, of, bagpipes, began, to, appear, with, frequency, in, western, european, art, and, iconography, the, cantigas, de, santa, maria, written, in, galician, portuguese, and, compiled, in, castile, in, the, mid, 13th, century, depicts, several, types, of, bagpipes, several, illustrations, of, bagpipes, also, appear, in, the, chronique, dite, de, baudoin, d, avesnes, a, 13th, century, manuscript, of, northern, french, origin, although, evidence, of, bagpipes, in, the, british, isles, prior, to, the, 14th, century, is, contested, they, are, explicitly, mentioned, in, the, canterbury, tales, written, around, 1380, a, baggepype, wel, coude, he, blowe, and, sowne, and, ther, with, al, he, broghte, us, out, of, towne, bagpipes, were, also, frequent, subjects, for, carvers, of, wooden, choir, stalls, in, the, late, 15th, and, early, 16th, century, throughout, europe, sometimes, with, animal, musicians, actual, specimens, of, bagpipes, from, before, the, 18th, century, are, extremely, rare, however, a, substantial, number, of, paintings, carvings, engravings, and, manuscript, illuminations, survive, these, artefacts, are, clear, evidence, that, bagpipes, varied, widely, throughout, europe, and, even, within, individual, regions, many, examples, of, early, folk, bagpipes, in, continental, europe, can, be, found, in, the, paintings, of, brueghel, teniers, jordaens, and, durer, the, earliest, known, artefact, identified, as, a, part, of, a, bagpipe, is, a, chanter, found, in, 1985, at, rostock, germany, that, has, been, dated, to, the, late, 14th, century, or, the, first, quarter, of, the, 15th, century, the, first, clear, reference, to, the, use, of, the, scottish, highland, bagpipes, is, from, a, french, history, that, mentions, their, use, at, the, battle, of, pinkie, in, 1547, george, buchanan, 1506, 82, claimed, that, bagpipes, had, replaced, the, trumpet, on, the, battlefield, this, period, saw, the, creation, of, the, ce, l, m, r, great, music, of, the, bagpipe, which, reflected, its, martial, origins, with, battle, tunes, marches, gatherings, salutes, and, laments, the, highlands, of, the, early, 17th, century, saw, the, development, of, piping, families, including, the, maccrimmonds, macarthurs, macgregors, and, the, mackays, of, gairloch, the, earliest, irish, mention, of, the, bagpipe, is, in, 1206, approximately, thirty, years, after, the, anglo, norman, invasion, another, mention, attributes, their, use, to, irish, troops, in, henry, viii, s, siege, of, boulogne, illustrations, in, the, 1581, book, the, image, of, irelande, by, john, derricke, clearly, depict, a, bagpiper, derricke, s, illustrations, are, considered, to, be, reasonably, faithful, depictions, of, the, attire, and, equipment, of, the, english, and, irish, population, of, the, 16th, century, the, battell, sequence, from, my, ladye, nevells, booke, 1591, by, william, byrd, which, probably, alludes, to, the, irish, wars, of, 1578, contains, a, piece, entitled, the, bagpipe, the, drone, in, 1760, the, first, serious, study, of, the, scottish, highland, bagpipe, and, its, music, was, attempted, in, joseph, macdonald, s, compleat, theory, a, manuscript, from, the, 1730s, by, a, william, dixon, of, northumberland, contains, music, that, fits, the, border, pipes, a, nine, note, bellows, blown, bagpipe, with, a, chanter, similar, to, that, of, the, modern, great, highland, bagpipe, however, the, music, in, dixon, s, manuscript, varied, greatly, from, modern, highland, bagpipe, tunes, consisting, mostly, of, extended, variation, sets, of, common, dance, tunes, some, of, the, tunes, in, the, dixon, manuscript, correspond, to, those, found, in, the, early, 19th, century, manuscript, sources, of, northumbrian, smallpipe, tunes, notably, the, rare, book, of, 50, tunes, many, with, variations, by, john, peacock, as, western, classical, music, developed, both, in, terms, of, musical, sophistication, and, instrumental, technology, bagpipes, in, many, regions, fell, out, of, favour, because, of, their, limited, range, and, function, this, triggered, a, long, slow, decline, that, continued, in, most, cases, into, the, 20th, century, extensive, and, documented, collections, of, traditional, bagpipes, may, be, found, at, the, metropolitan, museum, of, art, in, new, york, city, the, international, bagpipe, museum, in, gij, n, spain, the, pitt, rivers, museum, in, oxford, england, and, the, morpeth, chantry, bagpipe, museum, in, northumberland, and, the, musical, instrument, museum, in, phoenix, arizona, the, international, bagpipe, festival, is, held, every, two, years, in, strakonice, czech, republic, during, the, expansion, of, the, british, empire, spearheaded, by, british, military, forces, that, included, highland, regiments, the, scottish, great, highland, bagpipe, became, well, known, worldwide, this, surge, in, popularity, was, boosted, by, large, numbers, of, pipers, trained, for, military, service, in, world, war, i, and, world, war, ii, this, coincided, with, a, decline, in, the, popularity, of, many, traditional, forms, of, bagpipe, throughout, europe, which, began, to, be, displaced, by, instruments, from, the, classical, tradition, and, later, by, gramophone, and, radio, as, pipers, were, easily, identifiable, combat, losses, were, high, estimated, at, one, thousand, in, world, war, i, a, front, line, role, was, prohibited, following, high, losses, in, the, second, battle, of, el, alamein, in, 1943, though, a, few, later, instances, occurred, in, the, united, kingdom, and, commonwealth, nations, such, as, canada, new, zealand, and, australia, the, great, highland, bagpipe, is, commonly, used, in, the, military, and, is, often, played, during, formal, ceremonies, foreign, militaries, patterned, after, the, british, army, have, also, adopted, the, highland, bagpipe, including, those, of, uganda, sudan, india, pakistan, sri, lanka, jordan, and, oman, many, police, and, fire, services, in, scotland, canada, australia, new, zealand, hong, kong, and, the, united, states, have, also, adopted, the, tradition, of, fielding, pipe, bands, in, recent, years, often, driven, by, revivals, of, native, folk, music, and, dance, many, types, of, bagpipes, have, enjoyed, a, resurgence, in, popularity, and, in, many, cases, instruments, that, had, fallen, into, obscurity, have, become, extremely, popular, in, brittany, the, great, highland, bagpipe, and, concept, of, the, pipe, band, were, appropriated, to, create, a, breton, interpretation, known, as, the, bagad, the, pipe, band, idiom, has, also, been, adopted, and, applied, to, the, galician, gaita, as, well, bagpipes, have, often, been, used, in, various, films, depicting, moments, from, scottish, and, irish, history, the, film, braveheart, and, the, theatrical, show, riverdance, have, served, to, make, the, uilleann, pipes, more, commonly, known, bagpipes, are, sometimes, played, at, formal, events, at, commonwealth, universities, particularly, in, canada, because, of, scottish, influences, on, the, sport, of, curling, bagpipes, are, also, the, official, instrument, of, the, world, curling, federation, and, are, commonly, played, during, a, ceremonial, procession, of, teams, before, major, curling, championships, bagpipe, making, was, once, a, craft, that, produced, instruments, in, many, distinctive, local, and, traditional, styles, today, the, world, s, largest, producer, of, the, instrument, is, pakistan, where, the, industry, was, worth, 6, 8, million, in, 2010, in, the, late, 20th, century, various, models, of, electronic, bagpipes, were, invented, the, first, custom, built, midi, bagpipes, were, developed, by, the, asturian, piper, known, as, hevia, jos, ngel, hevia, velasco, astronaut, kjell, n, lindgren, is, thought, to, be, the, first, person, to, play, the, bagpipes, in, outer, space, having, played, amazing, grace, in, tribute, to, late, research, scientist, victor, hurst, aboard, the, international, space, station, in, november, 2015, traditionally, one, of, the, purposes, of, the, bagpipe, was, to, provide, music, for, dancing, this, has, declined, with, the, growth, of, dance, bands, recordings, and, the, decline, of, traditional, dance, in, turn, this, has, led, to, many, types, of, pipes, developing, a, performance, led, tradition, and, indeed, much, modern, music, based, on, the, dance, music, tradition, played, on, bagpipes, is, suitable, for, use, as, dance, music, numerous, types, of, bagpipes, today, are, widely, spread, across, europe, the, middle, east, and, north, africa, as, well, as, through, much, of, the, former, british, empire, the, name, bagpipe, has, almost, become, synonymous, with, its, best, known, form, the, great, highland, bagpipe, overshadowing, the, great, number, and, variety, of, traditional, forms, of, bagpipe, despite, the, decline, of, these, other, types, of, pipes, over, the, last, few, centuries, in, recent, years, many, of, these, pipes, have, seen, a, resurgence, or, revival, as, musicians, have, sought, them, out, for, example, the, irish, piping, tradition, which, by, the, mid, 20th, century, had, declined, to, a, handful, of, master, players, is, today, alive, well, and, flourishing, a, situation, similar, to, that, of, the, asturian, gaita, the, galician, gaita, the, portuguese, gaita, transmontana, the, aragonese, gaita, de, boto, northumbrian, smallpipes, the, breton, biniou, the, balkan, gaida, the, romanian, cimpoi, the, black, sea, tulum, the, scottish, smallpipes, and, pastoral, pipes, as, well, as, other, varieties, bulgaria, has, the, kaba, gaida, a, large, bagpipe, of, the, rhodope, mountains, with, a, hexagonal, and, rounded, drone, often, described, as, a, deep, sounding, gaida, and, the, dzhura, gaida, with, a, straight, conical, drone, and, of, a, higher, pitch, the, macedonian, gaida, is, structurally, between, a, kaba, and, dzhura, gaida, and, described, as, a, medium, pitched, gaida, in, southeastern, europe, and, eastern, europe, bagpipes, known, as, gaida, include, the, albanian, gajde, mishnica, bishnica, aromanian, gaid, bulgarian, gaida, greek, g, ida, tsabo, na, or, askomandoura, macedonian, gajda, serbo, croatian, gajda, turkish, gayda, also, tulum, and, ukrainian, gayda, in, tunisia, it, is, known, by, the, name, mezwed, it, is, used, in, the, tunisian, pop, music, genre, also, called, mezwed, that, is, named, after, the, instrument, since, the, 1960s, bagpipes, have, also, made, appearances, in, other, forms, of, music, including, rock, metal, jazz, hip, hop, punk, and, classical, music, for, example, with, paul, mccartney, s, mull, of, kintyre, ac, dc, s, it, s, a, long, way, to, the, top, if, you, wanna, rock, n, roll, and, peter, maxwell, davies, s, composition, an, orkney, wedding, with, sunrise, periodicals, covering, specific, types, of, bagpipes, are, addressed, in, the, article, for, that, bagpipe
