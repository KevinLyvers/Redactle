medieval, music, encompasses, the, sacred, and, secular, music, of, western, europe, during, the, middle, ages, from, approximately, the, 6th, to, 15th, centuries, it, is, the, first, and, longest, major, era, of, western, classical, music, and, is, followed, by, the, renaissance, music, the, two, eras, comprise, what, musicologists, generally, term, as, early, music, preceding, the, common, practice, period, following, the, traditional, division, of, the, middle, ages, medieval, music, can, be, divided, into, early, 500, 1000, high, 1000, 1300, and, late, 1300, 1400, medieval, music, medieval, music, includes, liturgical, music, used, for, the, church, other, sacred, music, and, secular, or, non, religious, music, much, medieval, music, is, purely, vocal, music, such, as, gregorian, chant, other, music, used, only, instruments, or, both, voices, and, instruments, typically, with, the, instruments, accompanying, the, voices, the, medieval, period, saw, the, creation, and, adaptation, of, systems, of, music, notation, which, enabled, creators, to, document, and, transmit, musical, ideas, more, easily, although, notation, coexisted, with, and, complemented, oral, tradition, medieval, music, was, created, for, a, number, of, different, uses, and, contexts, resulting, in, different, music, genres, liturgical, as, well, as, more, general, sacred, contexts, were, important, but, secular, types, emerged, as, well, including, love, songs, and, dances, during, the, earlier, medieval, period, liturgical, music, was, monophonic, chant, gregorian, chant, became, the, dominant, style, polyphonic, genres, in, which, multiple, independent, melodic, lines, are, performed, simultaneously, began, to, develop, during, the, high, medieval, era, becoming, prevalent, by, the, later, 13th, and, early, 14th, century, the, development, of, polyphonic, forms, is, often, associated, with, the, ars, antiqua, style, associated, with, notre, dame, de, paris, but, improvised, polyphony, around, chant, lines, predated, this, organum, for, example, elaborated, on, a, chant, melody, by, creating, one, or, more, accompanying, lines, the, accompanying, line, could, be, as, simple, as, a, second, line, sung, in, parallel, intervals, to, the, original, chant, often, a, perfect, fifth, or, perfect, fourth, away, from, the, main, melody, the, principles, of, this, kind, of, organum, date, back, at, least, to, an, anonymous, 9th, century, tract, the, musica, enchiriadis, which, describes, the, tradition, of, duplicating, a, preexisting, plainchant, in, parallel, motion, at, the, interval, of, an, octave, a, fifth, or, a, fourth, some, of, the, earliest, written, examples, come, are, in, a, style, known, as, aquitanian, polyphony, but, the, largest, body, of, surviving, organum, comes, from, the, notre, dame, school, this, loose, collection, of, repertory, is, often, called, the, magnus, liber, organi, great, book, of, organum, related, polyphonic, genres, included, the, motet, and, clausula, genres, both, also, often, built, on, an, original, segment, of, plainchant, or, as, an, elaboration, on, an, organum, passage, while, most, early, motets, were, sacred, and, may, have, been, liturgical, designed, for, use, in, a, church, service, by, the, end, of, the, thirteenth, century, the, genre, had, expanded, to, include, secular, topics, such, as, political, satire, and, courtly, love, and, french, as, well, as, latin, texts, they, also, included, from, one, to, three, upper, voices, each, with, its, own, text, in, italy, the, secular, genre, of, the, madrigal, became, popular, similar, to, the, polyphonic, character, of, the, motet, madrigals, featured, greater, fluidity, and, motion, in, the, leading, melody, line, the, madrigal, form, also, gave, rise, to, polyphonic, canons, songs, in, which, multiple, singers, sing, the, same, melody, but, starting, at, different, times, especially, in, italy, where, they, were, called, caccie, these, were, three, part, secular, pieces, which, featured, the, two, higher, voices, in, canon, with, an, underlying, instrumental, long, note, accompaniment, in, the, late, middle, ages, some, purely, instrumental, music, also, began, to, be, notated, though, this, remained, rare, dance, music, makes, up, most, of, the, surviving, instrumental, music, and, includes, types, such, as, the, estampie, ductia, and, nota, many, instruments, used, to, perform, medieval, music, still, exist, in, the, 21st, century, but, in, different, and, typically, more, technologically, developed, forms, the, flute, was, made, of, wood, in, the, medieval, era, rather, than, silver, or, other, metal, and, could, be, made, as, a, side, blown, or, end, blown, instrument, while, modern, orchestral, flutes, are, usually, made, of, metal, and, have, complex, key, mechanisms, and, airtight, pads, medieval, flutes, had, holes, that, the, performer, had, to, cover, with, the, fingers, as, with, the, recorder, the, recorder, was, made, of, wood, during, the, medieval, era, and, despite, the, fact, that, in, the, 21st, century, it, may, be, made, of, synthetic, materials, such, as, plastic, it, has, more, or, less, retained, its, past, form, the, gemshorn, is, similar, to, the, recorder, as, it, has, finger, holes, on, its, front, though, it, is, actually, a, member, of, the, ocarina, family, one, of, the, flute, s, predecessors, the, pan, flute, was, popular, in, medieval, times, and, is, possibly, of, hellenic, origin, this, instrument, s, pipes, were, made, of, wood, and, were, graduated, in, length, to, produce, different, pitches, medieval, music, used, many, plucked, string, instruments, like, the, lute, a, fretted, instrument, with, a, pear, shaped, hollow, body, which, is, the, predecessor, to, the, modern, guitar, other, plucked, stringed, instruments, included, the, mandore, gittern, citole, and, psaltery, the, dulcimers, similar, in, structure, to, the, psaltery, and, zither, were, originally, plucked, but, musicians, began, to, strike, the, dulcimer, with, hammers, in, the, 14th, century, after, the, arrival, of, new, metal, technology, that, made, metal, strings, possible, the, bowed, lyra, of, the, byzantine, empire, was, the, first, recorded, european, bowed, string, instrument, like, the, modern, violin, a, performer, produced, sound, by, moving, a, bow, with, tensioned, hair, over, tensioned, strings, the, persian, geographer, ibn, khurradadhbih, of, the, 9th, century, d, 911, cited, the, byzantine, lyra, in, his, lexicographical, discussion, of, instruments, as, a, bowed, instrument, equivalent, to, the, arab, rab, b, and, typical, instrument, of, the, byzantines, along, with, the, urghun, organ, shilyani, probably, a, type, of, harp, or, lyre, and, the, salandj, probably, a, bagpipe, the, hurdy, gurdy, was, and, still, is, a, mechanical, violin, using, a, rosined, wooden, wheel, attached, to, a, crank, to, bow, its, strings, instruments, without, sound, boxes, like, the, jew, s, harp, were, also, popular, early, versions, of, the, pipe, organ, fiddle, or, vielle, and, a, precursor, to, the, modern, trombone, called, the, sackbut, were, used, during, the, medieval, period, the, foundation, was, laid, for, the, notational, and, theoretical, practices, that, would, shape, western, music, into, the, norms, that, developed, during, the, common, practice, era, the, most, obvious, of, these, is, the, development, of, a, comprehensive, music, notational, system, however, the, theoretical, advances, particularly, in, regard, to, rhythm, and, polyphony, are, equally, important, to, the, development, of, western, music, the, earliest, medieval, music, did, not, have, any, kind, of, notational, system, the, tunes, were, primarily, monophonic, a, single, melody, without, accompaniment, and, transmitted, by, oral, tradition, as, rome, tried, to, centralize, the, various, liturgies, and, establish, the, roman, rite, as, the, primary, church, tradition, the, need, to, transmit, these, chant, melodies, across, vast, distances, effectively, was, equally, glaring, so, long, as, music, could, only, be, taught, to, people, by, ear, it, limited, the, ability, of, the, church, to, get, different, regions, to, sing, the, same, melodies, since, each, new, person, would, have, to, spend, time, with, a, person, who, already, knew, a, song, and, learn, it, by, ear, the, first, step, to, fix, this, problem, came, with, the, introduction, of, various, signs, written, above, the, chant, texts, to, indicate, direction, of, pitch, movement, called, neumes, the, origin, of, neumes, is, unclear, and, subject, to, some, debate, however, most, scholars, agree, that, their, closest, ancestors, are, the, classic, greek, and, roman, grammatical, signs, that, indicated, important, points, of, declamation, by, recording, the, rise, and, fall, of, the, voice, the, two, basic, signs, of, the, classical, grammarians, were, the, acutus, indicating, a, raising, of, the, voice, and, the, gravis, indicating, a, lowering, of, the, voice, a, singer, reading, a, chant, text, with, neume, markings, would, be, able, to, get, a, general, sense, of, whether, the, melody, line, went, up, in, pitch, stayed, the, same, or, went, down, in, pitch, since, trained, singers, knew, the, chant, repertoire, well, written, neume, markings, above, the, text, served, as, a, reminder, of, the, melody, but, did, not, specify, the, actual, intervals, however, a, singer, reading, a, chant, text, with, neume, markings, would, not, be, able, to, sight, read, a, song, which, he, or, she, had, never, heard, sung, before, these, pieces, would, not, be, possible, to, interpret, accurately, today, without, later, versions, in, more, precise, notation, systems, these, neumes, eventually, evolved, into, the, basic, symbols, for, neumatic, notation, the, virga, or, rod, which, indicates, a, higher, note, and, still, looked, like, the, acutus, from, which, it, came, and, the, punctum, or, dot, which, indicates, a, lower, note, and, as, the, name, suggests, reduced, the, gravis, symbol, to, a, point, thus, the, acutus, and, the, gravis, could, be, combined, to, represent, graphical, vocal, inflections, on, the, syllable, this, kind, of, notation, seems, to, have, developed, no, earlier, than, the, eighth, century, but, by, the, ninth, it, was, firmly, established, as, the, primary, method, of, musical, notation, the, basic, notation, of, the, virga, and, the, punctum, remained, the, symbols, for, individual, notes, but, other, neumes, soon, developed, which, showed, several, notes, joined, these, new, neumes, called, ligatures, are, essentially, combinations, of, the, two, original, signs, the, first, music, notation, was, the, use, of, dots, over, the, lyrics, to, a, chant, with, some, dots, being, higher, or, lower, giving, the, reader, a, general, sense, of, the, direction, of, the, melody, however, this, form, of, notation, only, served, as, a, memory, aid, for, a, singer, who, already, knew, the, melody, this, basic, neumatic, notation, could, only, specify, the, number, of, notes, and, whether, they, moved, up, or, down, there, was, no, way, to, indicate, exact, pitch, any, rhythm, or, even, the, starting, note, these, limitations, are, further, indication, that, the, neumes, were, developed, as, tools, to, support, the, practice, of, oral, tradition, rather, than, to, supplant, it, however, even, though, it, started, as, a, mere, memory, aid, the, worth, of, having, more, specific, notation, soon, became, evident, the, next, development, in, musical, notation, was, heighted, neumes, in, which, neumes, were, carefully, placed, at, different, heights, in, relation, to, each, other, this, allowed, the, neumes, to, give, a, rough, indication, of, the, size, of, a, given, interval, as, well, as, the, direction, this, quickly, led, to, one, or, two, lines, each, representing, a, particular, note, being, placed, on, the, music, with, all, of, the, neumes, relating, to, the, earlier, ones, at, first, these, lines, had, no, particular, meaning, and, instead, had, a, letter, placed, at, the, beginning, indicating, which, note, was, represented, however, the, lines, indicating, middle, c, and, the, f, a, fifth, below, slowly, became, most, common, having, been, at, first, merely, scratched, on, the, parchment, the, lines, now, were, drawn, in, two, different, colored, inks, usually, red, for, f, and, yellow, or, green, for, c, this, was, the, beginning, of, the, musical, staff, the, completion, of, the, four, line, staff, is, usually, credited, to, guido, d, arezzo, c, 1000, 1050, one, of, the, most, important, musical, theorists, of, the, middle, ages, while, older, sources, attribute, the, development, of, the, staff, to, guido, some, modern, scholars, suggest, that, he, acted, more, as, a, codifier, of, a, system, that, was, already, being, developed, either, way, this, new, notation, allowed, a, singer, to, learn, pieces, completely, unknown, to, him, in, a, much, shorter, amount, of, time, however, even, though, chant, notation, had, progressed, in, many, ways, one, fundamental, problem, remained, rhythm, the, neumatic, notational, system, even, in, its, fully, developed, state, did, not, clearly, define, any, kind, of, rhythm, for, the, singing, of, notes, the, music, theory, of, the, medieval, period, saw, several, advances, over, previous, practice, both, in, regard, to, tonal, material, texture, and, rhythm, concerning, rhythm, this, period, had, several, dramatic, changes, in, both, its, conception, and, notation, during, the, early, medieval, period, there, was, no, method, to, notate, rhythm, and, thus, the, rhythmical, practice, of, this, early, music, is, subject, to, debate, among, scholars, the, first, kind, of, written, rhythmic, system, developed, during, the, 13th, century, and, was, based, on, a, series, of, modes, this, rhythmic, plan, was, codified, by, the, music, theorist, johannes, de, garlandia, author, of, the, de, mensurabili, musica, c, 1250, the, treatise, which, defined, and, most, completely, elucidated, these, rhythmic, modes, in, his, treatise, johannes, de, garlandia, describes, six, species, of, mode, or, six, different, ways, in, which, longs, and, breves, can, be, arranged, each, mode, establishes, a, rhythmic, pattern, in, beats, or, tempora, within, a, common, unit, of, three, tempora, a, perfectio, that, is, repeated, again, and, again, furthermore, notation, without, text, is, based, on, chains, of, ligature, s, the, characteristic, notations, by, which, groups, of, notes, are, bound, to, one, another, the, rhythmic, mode, can, generally, be, determined, by, the, patterns, of, ligatures, used, once, a, rhythmic, mode, had, been, assigned, to, a, melodic, line, there, was, generally, little, deviation, from, that, mode, although, rhythmic, adjustments, could, be, indicated, by, changes, in, the, expected, pattern, of, ligatures, even, to, the, extent, of, changing, to, another, rhythmic, mode, the, next, step, forward, concerning, rhythm, came, from, the, german, theorist, franco, of, cologne, in, his, treatise, ars, cantus, mensurabilis, the, art, of, mensurable, music, written, around, 1280, he, describes, a, system, of, notation, in, which, differently, shaped, notes, have, entirely, different, rhythmic, values, this, is, a, striking, change, from, the, earlier, system, of, de, garlandia, whereas, before, the, length, of, the, individual, note, could, only, be, gathered, from, the, mode, itself, this, new, inverted, relationship, made, the, mode, dependent, upon, and, determined, by, the, individual, notes, or, figurae, that, have, incontrovertible, durational, values, an, innovation, which, had, a, massive, impact, on, the, subsequent, history, of, european, music, most, of, the, surviving, notated, music, of, the, 13th, century, uses, the, rhythmic, modes, as, defined, by, garlandia, the, step, in, the, evolution, of, rhythm, came, after, the, turn, of, the, 13th, century, with, the, development, of, the, ars, nova, style, the, theorist, who, is, most, well, recognized, in, regard, to, this, new, style, is, philippe, de, vitry, famous, for, writing, the, ars, nova, new, art, treatise, around, 1320, this, treatise, on, music, gave, its, name, to, the, style, of, this, entire, era, in, some, ways, the, modern, system, of, rhythmic, notation, began, with, vitry, who, completely, broke, free, from, the, older, idea, of, the, rhythmic, modes, the, notational, predecessors, of, modern, time, meters, also, originate, in, the, ars, nova, this, new, style, was, clearly, built, upon, the, work, of, franco, of, cologne, in, franco, s, system, the, relationship, between, a, breve, and, a, semibreves, that, is, half, breves, was, equivalent, to, that, between, a, breve, and, a, long, and, since, for, him, modus, was, always, perfect, grouped, in, threes, the, tempus, or, beat, was, also, inherently, perfect, and, therefore, contained, three, semibreves, sometimes, the, context, of, the, mode, would, require, a, group, of, only, two, semibreves, however, these, two, semibreves, would, always, be, one, of, normal, length, and, one, of, double, length, thereby, taking, the, same, space, of, time, and, thus, preserving, the, perfect, subdivision, of, the, tempus, this, ternary, division, held, for, all, note, values, in, contrast, the, ars, nova, period, introduced, two, important, changes, the, first, was, an, even, smaller, subdivision, of, notes, semibreves, could, now, be, divided, into, minim, and, the, second, was, the, development, of, mensuration, mensurations, could, be, combined, in, various, manners, to, produce, metrical, groupings, these, groupings, of, mensurations, are, the, precursors, of, simple, and, compound, meter, by, the, time, of, ars, nova, the, perfect, division, of, the, tempus, was, not, the, only, option, as, duple, divisions, became, more, accepted, for, vitry, the, breve, could, be, divided, for, an, entire, composition, or, section, of, one, into, groups, of, two, or, three, smaller, semibreves, this, way, the, tempus, the, term, that, came, to, denote, the, division, of, the, breve, could, be, either, perfect, tempus, perfectum, with, ternary, subdivision, or, imperfect, tempus, imperfectum, with, binary, subdivision, in, a, similar, fashion, the, semibreve, s, division, termed, prolation, could, be, divided, into, three, minima, prolatio, perfectus, or, major, prolation, or, two, minima, prolatio, imperfectus, or, minor, prolation, and, at, the, higher, level, the, longs, division, called, modus, could, be, three, or, two, breves, modus, perfectus, or, perfect, mode, or, modus, imperfectus, or, imperfect, mode, respectively, vitry, took, this, a, step, further, by, indicating, the, proper, division, of, a, given, piece, at, the, beginning, through, the, use, of, a, mensuration, sign, equivalent, to, our, modern, time, signature, tempus, perfectum, was, indicated, by, a, circle, while, tempus, imperfectum, was, denoted, by, a, half, circle, the, current, symbol, used, as, an, alternative, for, the, 4, 4, time, signature, is, actually, a, holdover, of, this, symbol, not, a, letter, c, as, an, abbreviation, for, common, time, as, popularly, believed, while, many, of, these, innovations, are, ascribed, to, vitry, and, somewhat, present, in, the, ars, nova, treatise, it, was, a, contemporary, and, personal, acquaintance, of, de, vitry, named, johannes, de, muris, or, jehan, des, mars, who, offered, the, most, comprehensive, and, systematic, treatment, of, the, new, mensural, innovations, of, the, ars, nova, for, a, brief, explanation, of, the, mensural, notation, in, general, see, the, article, renaissance, music, many, scholars, citing, a, lack, of, positive, attributory, evidence, now, consider, vitry, s, treatise, to, be, anonymous, but, this, does, not, diminish, its, importance, for, the, history, of, rhythmic, notation, however, this, makes, the, first, definitely, identifiable, scholar, to, accept, and, explain, the, mensural, system, to, be, de, muris, who, can, be, said, to, have, done, for, it, what, garlandia, did, for, the, rhythmic, modes, for, the, duration, of, the, medieval, period, most, music, would, be, composed, primarily, in, perfect, tempus, with, special, effects, created, by, sections, of, imperfect, tempus, there, is, a, great, current, controversy, among, musicologists, as, to, whether, such, sections, were, performed, with, a, breve, of, equal, length, or, whether, it, changed, and, if, so, at, what, proportion, this, ars, nova, style, remained, the, primary, rhythmical, system, until, the, highly, syncopated, works, of, the, ars, subtilior, at, the, end, of, the, 14th, century, characterized, by, extremes, of, notational, and, rhythmic, complexity, this, sub, genera, pushed, the, rhythmic, freedom, provided, by, ars, nova, to, its, limits, with, some, compositions, having, different, voices, written, in, different, mensurations, simultaneously, the, rhythmic, complexity, that, was, realized, in, this, music, is, comparable, to, that, in, the, 20th, century, of, equal, importance, to, the, overall, history, of, western, music, theory, were, the, textural, changes, that, came, with, the, advent, of, polyphony, this, practice, shaped, western, music, into, the, harmonically, dominated, music, that, we, know, today, the, first, accounts, of, this, textural, development, were, found, in, two, anonymous, yet, widely, circulated, treatises, on, music, the, musica, and, the, scolica, enchiriadis, these, texts, are, dated, to, sometime, within, the, last, half, of, the, ninth, century, the, treatises, describe, a, technique, that, seemed, already, to, be, well, established, in, practice, this, early, polyphony, is, based, on, three, simple, and, three, compound, intervals, the, first, group, comprises, fourths, fifths, and, octaves, while, the, second, group, has, octave, plus, fourths, octave, plus, fifths, and, double, octaves, this, new, practice, is, given, the, name, organum, by, the, author, of, the, treatises, organum, can, further, be, classified, depending, on, the, time, period, in, which, it, was, written, the, early, organum, as, described, in, the, enchiriadis, can, be, termed, strict, organum, strict, organum, can, in, turn, be, subdivided, into, two, types, diapente, organum, at, the, interval, of, a, fifth, and, diatesseron, organum, at, the, interval, of, a, fourth, however, both, of, these, kinds, of, strict, organum, had, problems, with, the, musical, rules, of, the, time, if, either, of, them, paralleled, an, original, chant, for, too, long, depending, on, the, mode, a, tritone, would, result, this, problem, was, somewhat, overcome, with, the, use, of, a, second, type, of, organum, this, second, style, of, organum, was, called, free, organum, its, distinguishing, factor, is, that, the, parts, did, not, have, to, move, only, in, parallel, motion, but, could, also, move, in, oblique, or, contrary, motion, this, made, it, much, easier, to, avoid, the, dreaded, tritone, the, final, style, of, organum, that, developed, was, known, as, melismatic, organum, which, was, a, rather, dramatic, departure, from, the, rest, of, the, polyphonic, music, up, to, this, point, this, new, style, was, not, note, against, note, but, was, rather, one, sustained, line, accompanied, by, a, florid, melismatic, line, this, final, kind, of, organum, was, also, incorporated, by, the, most, famous, polyphonic, composer, of, this, time, l, onin, he, united, this, style, with, measured, discant, passages, which, used, the, rhythmic, modes, to, create, the, pinnacle, of, organum, composition, this, final, stage, of, organum, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, notre, dame, school, of, polyphony, since, that, was, where, l, onin, and, his, student, p, rotin, were, stationed, furthermore, this, kind, of, polyphony, influenced, all, subsequent, styles, with, the, later, polyphonic, genera, of, motets, starting, as, a, trope, of, existing, notre, dame, organums, another, important, element, of, medieval, music, theory, was, the, system, by, which, pitches, were, arranged, and, understood, during, the, middle, ages, this, systematic, arrangement, of, a, series, of, whole, steps, and, half, steps, what, we, now, call, a, scale, was, known, as, a, mode, the, modal, system, worked, like, the, scales, of, today, insomuch, that, it, provided, the, rules, and, material, for, melodic, writing, the, eight, church, modes, are, dorian, hypodorian, phrygian, hypophrygian, lydian, hypolydian, mixolydian, and, hypomixolydian, much, of, the, information, concerning, these, modes, as, well, as, the, practical, application, of, them, was, codified, in, the, 11th, century, by, the, theorist, johannes, afflighemensis, in, his, work, he, describes, three, defining, elements, to, each, mode, the, final, or, finalis, the, reciting, tone, tenor, or, confinalis, and, the, range, or, ambitus, the, finalis, is, the, tone, that, serves, as, the, focal, point, for, the, mode, and, as, the, name, suggests, is, almost, always, used, as, the, final, tone, the, reciting, tone, is, the, tone, that, serves, as, the, primary, focal, point, in, the, melody, particularly, internally, it, is, generally, also, the, tone, most, often, repeated, in, the, piece, and, finally, the, range, delimits, the, upper, and, lower, tones, for, a, given, mode, the, eight, modes, can, be, further, divided, into, four, categories, based, on, their, final, finalis, medieval, theorists, called, these, pairs, maneriae, and, labeled, them, according, to, the, greek, ordinal, numbers, those, modes, that, have, d, e, f, and, g, as, their, final, are, put, into, the, groups, protus, deuterus, tritus, and, tetrardus, respectively, these, can, then, be, divided, further, based, on, whether, the, mode, is, authentic, or, plagal, these, distinctions, deal, with, the, range, of, the, mode, in, relation, to, the, final, the, authentic, modes, have, a, range, that, is, about, an, octave, one, tone, above, or, below, is, allowed, and, start, on, the, final, whereas, the, plagal, modes, while, still, covering, about, an, octave, start, a, perfect, fourth, below, the, authentic, another, interesting, aspect, of, the, modal, system, is, the, use, of, musica, ficta, which, allows, pitches, to, be, altered, changing, b, to, b, for, example, in, certain, contexts, regardless, of, the, mode, these, changes, have, several, uses, but, one, that, seems, particularly, common, is, to, avoid, melodic, difficulties, caused, by, the, tritone, these, ecclesiastical, modes, although, they, have, greek, names, have, little, relationship, to, the, modes, as, set, out, by, greek, theorists, rather, most, of, the, terminology, seems, to, be, a, misappropriation, on, the, part, of, the, medieval, theorists, although, the, church, modes, have, no, relation, to, the, ancient, greek, modes, the, overabundance, of, greek, terminology, does, point, to, an, interesting, possible, origin, in, the, liturgical, melodies, of, the, byzantine, tradition, this, system, is, called, octoechos, and, is, also, divided, into, eight, categories, called, echoi, for, specific, medieval, music, theorists, see, also, isidore, of, seville, aurelian,

a, monophonic, sacred, single, unaccompanied, melody, form, which, represents, the, earliest, known, music, of, the, christian, church, chant, developed, separately, in, several, european, centres, although, the, most, important, were, rome, hispania, gaul, milan, and, ireland, there, were, others, as, well, these, styles, were, all, developed, to, support, the, regional, liturgies, used, when, celebrating, the, mass, there, each, area, developed, its, own, chant, and, rules, for, celebration, in, spain, and, portugal, mozarabic, chant, was, used, and, shows, the, influence, of, north, african, music, the, mozarabic, liturgy, even, survived, through, muslim, rule, though, this, was, an, isolated, strand, and, this, music, was, later, suppressed, in, an, attempt, to, enforce, conformity, on, the, entire, liturgy, in, milan, ambrosian, chant, named, after, st, ambrose, was, the, standard, while, beneventan, chant, developed, around, benevento, another, italian, liturgical, center, gallican, chant, was, used, in, gaul, and, celtic, chant, in, ireland, and, great, britain, the, reigning, carolingian, dynasty, wanted, to, standardize, the, mass, and, chant, across, its, frankish, empire, at, this, time, rome, was, the, religious, centre, of, western, europe, and, northern, gaul, and, rhineland, most, notably, the, city, of, aachen, was, the, political, centre, the, standardization, effort, consisted, mainly, of, combining, the, two, roman, and, gallican, regional, liturgies, charlemagne, 742, 814, sent, trained, singers, throughout, the, empire, to, teach, this, new, form, of, chant, this, body, of, chant, became, known, as, gregorian, chant, named, after, pope, gregory, i, gregorian, chant, was, said, to, be, collected, and, codified, during, his, papacy, or, even, composed, by, himself, inspired, by, the, holy, spirit, in, the, form, of, a, dove, however, that, is, only, a, popular, legend, that, was, spread, by, the, carolingians, who, wanted, to, legitimize, their, liturgy, unification, efforts, gregorian, chant, certainly, didn, t, exist, at, that, time, it, is, possible, nevertheless, that, gregory, s, papacy, really, may, have, contributed, to, collecting, and, codifying, the, roman, chant, of, the, time, which, then, in, the, 9th, and, 10th, centuries, formed, alongside, the, gallican, chant, one, of, the, two, roots, of, the, gregorian, chant, by, the, 12th, and, 13th, centuries, gregorian, chant, had, superseded, all, the, other, western, chant, traditions, with, the, exception, of, the, ambrosian, chant, in, milan, and, the, mozarabic, chant, in, a, few, specially, designated, spanish, chapels, hildegard, von, bingen, 1098, 1179, was, one, of, the, earliest, known, female, composers, she, wrote, many, monophonic, works, for, the, catholic, church, almost, all, of, them, for, female, voices, around, the, end, of, the, 9th, century, singers, in, monasteries, such, as, st, gall, in, switzerland, began, experimenting, with, adding, another, part, to, the, chant, generally, a, voice, in, parallel, motion, singing, mostly, in, perfect, fourths, or, fifths, above, the, original, tune, see, interval, this, development, is, called, organum, and, represents, the, beginnings, of, counterpoint, and, ultimately, harmony, over, the, next, several, centuries, organum, developed, in, several, ways, the, most, significant, of, these, developments, was, the, creation, of, florid, organum, around, 1100, sometimes, known, as, the, school, of, st, martial, named, after, a, monastery, in, south, central, france, which, contains, the, best, preserved, manuscript, of, this, repertory, in, florid, organum, the, original, tune, would, be, sung, in, long, notes, while, an, accompanying, voice, would, sing, many, notes, to, each, one, of, the, original, often, in, a, highly, elaborate, fashion, all, the, while, emphasizing, the, perfect, consonances, fourths, fifths, and, octaves, as, in, the, earlier, organa, later, developments, of, organum, occurred, in, england, where, the, interval, of, the, third, was, particularly, favoured, and, where, organa, were, likely, improvised, against, an, existing, chant, melody, and, at, notre, dame, in, paris, which, was, to, be, the, centre, of, musical, creative, activity, throughout, the, thirteenth, century, much, of, the, music, from, the, early, medieval, period, is, anonymous, some, of, the, names, may, have, been, poets, and, lyric, writers, and, the, tunes, for, which, they, wrote, words, may, have, been, composed, by, others, attribution, of, monophonic, music, of, the, medieval, period, is, not, always, reliable, surviving, manuscripts, from, this, period, include, the, musica, enchiriadis, codex, calixtinus, of, santiago, de, compostela, the, magnus, liber, and, the, winchester, troper, for, information, about, specific, composers, or, poets, writing, during, the, early, medieval, period, see, pope, gregory, i, st, godric, hildegard, of, bingen, hucbald, notker, balbulus, odo, of, arezzo, odo, of, cluny, and, tutilo, another, musical, tradition, of, europe, originating, during, the, early, middle, ages, was, the, liturgical, drama, liturgical, drama, developed, possibly, in, the, 10th, century, from, the, tropes, poetic, embellishments, of, the, liturgical, texts, one, of, the, tropes, the, so, called, quem, quaeritis, belonging, to, the, liturgy, of, easter, morning, developed, into, a, short, play, around, the, year, 950, the, oldest, surviving, written, source, is, the, winchester, troper, around, the, year, 1000, it, was, sung, widely, in, northern, europe, shortly, a, similar, christmas, play, was, developed, musically, and, textually, following, the, easter, one, and, other, plays, followed, there, is, a, controversy, among, musicologists, as, to, the, instrumental, accompaniment, of, such, plays, given, that, the, stage, directions, very, elaborate, and, precise, in, other, respects, do, not, request, any, participation, of, instruments, these, dramas, were, performed, by, monks, nuns, and, priests, in, contrast, to, secular, plays, which, were, spoken, the, liturgical, drama, was, always, sung, many, have, been, preserved, sufficiently, to, allow, modern, reconstruction, and, performance, for, example, the, play, of, daniel, which, has, been, recently, recorded, at, least, ten, times, the, goliards, were, itinerant, poet, musicians, of, europe, from, the, tenth, to, the, middle, of, the, thirteenth, century, most, were, scholars, or, ecclesiastics, and, they, wrote, and, sang, in, latin, although, many, of, the, poems, have, survived, very, little, of, the, music, has, they, were, possibly, influential, even, decisively, so, on, the, troubadour, trouv, re, tradition, which, was, to, follow, most, of, their, poetry, is, secular, and, while, some, of, the, songs, celebrate, religious, ideals, others, are, frankly, profane, dealing, with, drunkenness, debauchery, and, lechery, one, of, the, most, important, extant, sources, of, goliards, chansons, is, the, carmina, burana, the, flowering, of, the, notre, dame, school, of, polyphony, from, around, 1150, to, 1250, corresponded, to, the, equally, impressive, achievements, in, gothic, architecture, indeed, the, centre, of, activity, was, at, the, cathedral, of, notre, dame, itself, sometimes, the, music, of, this, period, is, called, the, parisian, school, or, parisian, organum, and, represents, the, beginning, of, what, is, conventionally, known, as, ars, antiqua, this, was, the, period, in, which, rhythmic, notation, first, appeared, in, western, music, mainly, a, context, based, method, of, rhythmic, notation, known, as, the, rhythmic, modes, this, was, also, the, period, in, which, concepts, of, formal, structure, developed, which, were, attentive, to, proportion, texture, and, architectural, effect, composers, of, the, period, alternated, florid, and, discant, organum, more, note, against, note, as, opposed, to, the, succession, of, many, note, melismas, against, long, held, notes, found, in, the, florid, type, and, created, several, new, musical, forms, clausulae, which, were, melismatic, sections, of, organa, extracted, and, fitted, with, new, words, and, further, musical, elaboration, conductus, which, were, songs, for, one, or, more, voices, to, be, sung, rhythmically, most, likely, in, a, procession, of, some, sort, and, tropes, which, were, additions, of, new, words, and, sometimes, new, music, to, sections, of, older, chant, all, of, these, genres, save, one, were, based, upon, chant, that, is, one, of, the, voices, usually, three, though, sometimes, four, nearly, always, the, lowest, the, tenor, at, this, point, sang, a, chant, melody, though, with, freely, composed, note, lengths, over, which, the, other, voices, sang, organum, the, exception, to, this, method, was, the, conductus, a, two, voice, composition, that, was, freely, composed, in, its, entirety, the, motet, one, of, the, most, important, musical, forms, of, the, high, middle, ages, and, renaissance, developed, initially, during, the, notre, dame, period, out, of, the, clausula, especially, the, form, using, multiple, voices, as, elaborated, by, p, rotin, who, paved, the, way, for, this, particularly, by, replacing, many, of, his, predecessor, as, canon, of, the, cathedral, l, onin, s, lengthy, florid, clausulae, with, substitutes, in, a, discant, style, gradually, there, came, to, be, entire, books, of, these, substitutes, available, to, be, fitted, in, and, out, of, the, various, chants, since, in, fact, there, were, more, than, can, possibly, have, been, used, in, context, it, is, probable, that, the, clausulae, came, to, be, performed, independently, either, in, other, parts, of, the, mass, or, in, private, devotions, the, clausula, thus, practised, became, the, motet, when, troped, with, non, liturgical, words, and, this, further, developed, into, a, form, of, great, elaboration, sophistication, and, subtlety, in, the, fourteenth, century, the, period, of, ars, nova, surviving, manuscripts, from, this, era, include, the, montpellier, codex, bamberg, codex, and, las, huelgas, codex, composers, of, this, time, include, l, onin, p, rotin, w, de, wycombe, adam, de, st, victor, and, petrus, de, cruce, pierre, de, la, croix, petrus, is, credited, with, the, innovation, of, writing, more, than, three, semibreves, to, fit, the, length, of, a, breve, coming, before, the, innovation, of, imperfect, tempus, this, practice, inaugurated, the, era, of, what, are, now, called, petronian, motets, these, late, 13th, century, works, are, in, three, to, four, parts, and, have, multiple, texts, sung, simultaneously, originally, the, tenor, line, from, the, latin, tenere, to, hold, held, a, preexisting, liturgical, chant, line, in, the, original, latin, while, the, text, of, the, one, two, or, even, three, voices, above, called, the, voces, organales, provided, commentary, on, the, liturgical, subject, either, in, latin, or, in, the, vernacular, french, the, rhythmic, values, of, the, voces, organales, decreased, as, the, parts, multiplied, with, the, duplum, the, part, above, the, tenor, having, smaller, rhythmic, values, than, the, tenor, the, triplum, the, line, above, the, duplum, having, smaller, rhythmic, values, than, the, duplum, and, so, on, as, time, went, by, the, texts, of, the, voces, organales, became, increasingly, secular, in, nature, and, had, less, and, less, overt, connection, to, the, liturgical, text, in, the, tenor, line, the, increasing, rhythmic, complexity, seen, in, petronian, motets, would, be, a, fundamental, characteristic, of, the, 14th, century, though, music, in, france, italy, and, england, would, take, quite, different, paths, during, that, time, the, cantigas, de, santa, maria, canticles, of, st, mary, are, 420, poems, with, musical, notation, written, in, galician, portuguese, during, the, reign, of, alfonso, x, the, wise, 1221, 1284, the, manuscript, was, probably, compiled, from, 1270, to, 1280, and, is, highly, decorated, with, an, illumination, every, 10, poems, the, illuminations, often, depict, musicians, making, the, manuscript, a, particularly, important, source, of, medieval, music, iconography, though, the, cantigas, are, often, attributed, to, alfonso, it, remains, unclear, as, to, whether, he, was, a, composer, himself, or, perhaps, a, compiler, alfonso, is, known, to, regularly, invited, musicians, and, poets, to, court, whom, were, undoubtedly, involved, in, the, cantigas, production, it, is, one, of, the, largest, collections, of, monophonic, solo, songs, from, the, middle, ages, and, is, characterized, by, the, mention, of, the, virgin, mary, in, every, song, while, every, tenth, song, is, a, hymn, the, manuscripts, have, survived, in, four, codices, two, at, el, escorial, one, at, madrid, s, national, library, and, one, in, florence, italy, some, have, colored, miniatures, showing, pairs, of, musicians, playing, a, wide, variety, of, instruments, the, music, of, the, troubadours, and, trouv, res, was, a, vernacular, tradition, of, monophonic, secular, song, probably, accompanied, by, instruments, sung, by, professional, occasionally, itinerant, musicians, who, were, as, skilled, as, poets, as, they, were, singers, and, instrumentalists, the, language, of, the, troubadours, was, occitan, also, known, as, the, langue, d, oc, or, proven, al, the, language, of, the, trouv, res, was, old, french, also, known, as, langue, d, o, l, the, period, of, the, troubadours, corresponded, to, the, flowering, of, cultural, life, in, provence, which, lasted, through, the, twelfth, century, and, into, the, first, decade, of, the, thirteenth, typical, subjects, of, troubadour, song, were, war, chivalry, and, courtly, love, the, love, of, an, idealized, woman, from, afar, the, period, of, the, troubadours, wound, down, after, the, albigensian, crusade, the, fierce, campaign, by, pope, innocent, iii, to, eliminate, the, cathar, heresy, and, northern, barons, desire, to, appropriate, the, wealth, of, the, south, surviving, troubadours, went, either, to, portugal, spain, northern, italy, or, northern, france, where, the, trouv, re, tradition, lived, on, where, their, skills, and, techniques, contributed, to, the, later, developments, of, secular, musical, culture, in, those, places, the, trouv, res, and, troubadours, shared, similar, musical, styles, but, the, trouv, res, were, generally, noblemen, the, music, of, the, trouv, res, was, similar, to, that, of, the, troubadours, but, was, able, to, survive, into, the, thirteenth, century, unaffected, by, the, albigensian, crusade, most, of, the, more, than, two, thousand, surviving, trouv, re, songs, include, music, and, show, a, sophistication, as, great, as, that, of, the, poetry, it, accompanies, the, minnes, nger, tradition, was, the, germanic, counterpart, to, the, activity, of, the, troubadours, and, trouv, res, to, the, west, unfortunately, few, sources, survive, from, the, time, the, sources, of, minnesang, are, mostly, from, two, or, three, centuries, after, the, peak, of, the, movement, leading, to, some, controversy, over, the, accuracy, of, these, sources, among, the, minnes, ngers, with, surviving, music, are, wolfram, von, eschenbach, walther, von, der, vogelweide, and, niedhart, von, reuenthal, a, meistersinger, german, for, master, singer, was, a, member, of, a, german, guild, for, lyric, poetry, composition, and, unaccompanied, art, song, of, the, 14th, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, the, meistersingers, were, drawn, from, middle, class, males, for, the, most, part, konrad, von, w, rzburg, reinmar, von, zweter, and, heinrich, frauenlob, frauenlob, allegedly, established, the, earliest, meistersinger, school, at, mainz, early, in, the, 14th, century, the, schools, originated, first, in, the, upper, rhine, district, then, spread, elsewhere, in, the, middle, ages, galician, portuguese, was, the, language, used, in, nearly, all, of, iberia, for, lyric, poetry, from, this, language, derive, both, modern, galician, and, portuguese, the, galician, portuguese, school, which, was, influenced, to, some, extent, mainly, in, certain, formal, aspects, by, the, occitan, troubadours, is, first, documented, at, the, end, of, the, twelfth, century, and, lasted, until, the, middle, of, the, fourteenth, the, earliest, extant, composition, in, this, school, is, usually, agreed, to, be, ora, faz, ost, o, senhor, de, navarra, by, the, portuguese, jo, o, soares, de, paiva, usually, dated, just, before, or, after, 1200, the, troubadours, of, the, movement, not, to, be, confused, with, the, occitan, troubadours, who, frequented, courts, in, nearby, le, n, and, castile, wrote, almost, entirely, cantigas, beginning, probably, around, the, middle, of, the, thirteenth, century, these, songs, known, also, as, cantares, or, trovas, began, to, be, compiled, in, collections, known, as, cancioneiros, songbooks, three, such, anthologies, are, known, the, cancioneiro, da, ajuda, the, cancioneiro, colocci, brancuti, or, cancioneiro, da, biblioteca, nacional, de, lisboa, and, the, cancioneiro, da, vaticana, in, addition, to, these, there, is, the, priceless, collection, of, over, 400, galician, portuguese, cantigas, in, the, cantigas, de, santa, maria, which, tradition, attributes, to, alfonso, x, the, galician, portuguese, cantigas, can, be, divided, into, three, basic, genres, male, voiced, love, poetry, called, cantigas, de, amor, or, cantigas, d, amor, in, galician, portuguese, spelling, female, voiced, love, poetry, called, cantigas, de, amigo, or, cantigas, d, amigo, and, poetry, of, insult, and, mockery, called, cantigas, de, esc, rnio, e, maldizer, or, cantigas, d, escarnho, e, de, mal, dizer, all, three, are, lyric, genres, in, the, technical, sense, that, they, were, strophic, songs, with, either, musical, accompaniment, or, introduction, on, a, stringed, instrument, but, all, three, genres, also, have, dramatic, elements, leading, early, scholars, to, characterize, them, as, lyric, dramatic, the, origins, of, the, cantigas, d, amor, are, usually, traced, to, proven, al, and, old, french, lyric, poetry, but, formally, and, rhetorically, they, are, quite, different, the, cantigas, d, amigo, are, probably, rooted, in, a, native, song, tradition, though, this, view, has, been, contested, the, cantigas, d, escarnho, e, maldizer, may, also, according, to, lang, have, deep, local, roots, the, latter, two, genres, totalling, around, 900, texts, make, the, galician, portuguese, lyric, unique, in, the, entire, panorama, of, medieval, romance, poetry, the, beginning, of, the, ars, nova, is, one, of, the, few, clear, chronological, divisions, in, medieval, music, since, it, corresponds, to, the, publication, of, the, roman, de, fauvel, a, huge, compilation, of, poetry, and, music, in, 1310, and, 1314, the, roman, de, fauvel, is, a, satire, on, abuses, in, the, medieval, church, and, is, filled, with, medieval, motets, lais, rondeaux, and, other, new, secular, forms, while, most, of, the, music, is, anonymous, it, contains, several, pieces, by, philippe, de, vitry, one, of, the, first, composers, of, the, isorhythmic, motet, a, development, which, distinguishes, the, fourteenth, century, the, isorhythmic, motet, was, perfected, by, guillaume, de, machaut, the, finest, composer, of, the, time, during, the, ars, nova, era, secular, music, acquired, a, polyphonic, sophistication, formerly, found, only, in, sacred, music, a, development, not, surprising, considering, the, secular, character, of, the, early, renaissance, while, this, music, is, typically, considered, medieval, the, social, forces, that, produced, it, were, responsible, for, the, beginning, of, the, literary, and, artistic, renaissance, in, italy, the, distinction, between, middle, ages, and, renaissance, is, a, blurry, one, especially, considering, arts, as, different, as, music, and, painting, the, term, ars, nova, new, art, or, new, technique, was, coined, by, philippe, de, vitry, in, his, treatise, of, that, name, probably, written, in, 1322, in, order, to, distinguish, the, practice, from, the, music, of, the, immediately, preceding, age, the, dominant, secular, genre, of, the, ars, nova, was, the, chanson, as, it, would, continue, to, be, in, france, for, another, two, centuries, these, chansons, were, composed, in, musical, forms, corresponding, to, the, poetry, they, set, which, were, in, the, so, called, formes, fixes, of, rondeau, ballade, and, virelai, these, forms, significantly, affected, the, development, of, musical, structure, in, ways, that, are, felt, even, today, for, example, the, ouvert, clos, rhyme, scheme, shared, by, all, three, demanded, a, musical, realization, which, contributed, directly, to, the, modern, notion, of, antecedent, and, consequent, phrases, it, was, in, this, period, too, in, which, began, the, long, tradition, of, setting, the, mass, ordinary, this, tradition, started, around, mid, century, with, isolated, or, paired, settings, of, kyries, glorias, etc, but, machaut, composed, what, is, thought, to, be, the, first, complete, mass, conceived, as, one, composition, the, sound, world, of, ars, nova, music, is, very, much, one, of, linear, primacy, and, rhythmic, complexity, resting, intervals, are, the, fifth, and, octave, with, thirds, and, sixths, considered, dissonances, leaps, of, more, than, a, sixth, in, individual, voices, are, not, uncommon, leading, to, speculation, of, instrumental, participation, at, least, in, secular, performance, surviving, french, manuscripts, include, the, ivrea, codex, and, the, apt, codex, for, information, about, specific, french, composers, writing, in, late, medieval, era, see, jehan, de, lescurel, philippe, de, vitry, guillaume, de, machaut, borlet, solage, and, fran, ois, andrieu, most, of, the, music, of, ars, nova, was, french, in, origin, however, the, term, is, often, loosely, applied, to, all, of, the, music, of, the, fourteenth, century, especially, to, include, the, secular, music, in, italy, there, this, period, was, often, referred, to, as, trecento, italian, music, has, always, been, known, for, its, lyrical, or, melodic, character, and, this, goes, back, to, the, 14th, century, in, many, respects, italian, secular, music, of, this, time, what, little, surviving, liturgical, music, there, is, is, similar, to, the, french, except, for, somewhat, different, notation, featured, what, has, been, called, the, cantalina, style, with, a, florid, top, voice, supported, by, two, or, even, one, a, fair, amount, of, italian, trecento, music, is, for, only, two, voices, that, are, more, regular, and, slower, moving, this, type, of, texture, remained, a, feature, of, italian, music, in, the, popular, 15th, and, 16th, century, secular, genres, as, well, and, was, an, important, influence, on, the, eventual, development, of, the, trio, texture, that, revolutionized, music, in, the, 17th, there, were, three, main, forms, for, secular, works, in, the, trecento, one, was, the, madrigal, not, the, same, as, that, of, 150, 250, years, later, but, with, a, verse, refrain, like, form, three, line, stanzas, each, with, different, words, alternated, with, a, two, line, ritornello, with, the, same, text, at, each, appearance, perhaps, we, can, see, the,

disparate, sections, another, form, the, caccia, chase, was, written, for, two, voices, in, a, canon, at, the, unison, sometimes, this, form, also, featured, a, ritornello, which, was, occasionally, also, in, a, canonic, style, usually, the, name, of, this, genre, provided, a, double, meaning, since, the, texts, of, caccia, were, primarily, about, hunts, and, related, outdoor, activities, or, at, least, action, filled, scenes, second, meaning, was, that, a, voice, caccia, follows, run, after, the, preceding, one, the, third, main, form, was, the, ballata, which, was, roughly, equivalent, to,

wrath, of, an, angry, god, by, penitential, music, accompanied, by, mortification, of, their, bodies, there, were, two, separate, periods, of, activity, of, geisslerlied, one, around, the, middle, of, the, thirteenth, century, from, which, unfortunately, no, music, survives, although, numerous, lyrics, do, and, another, from, 1349, for, which, both, words, and, music, survive, intact, due, to, the, attention, of, a, single, priest, who, wrote, about, the, movement, and, recorded, its, music, this, second, period, corresponds, to, the, spread, of, the, black, death, in, europe, and, documents, one, of, the, most, terrible, events, in, european, history, both, periods, of, geisslerlied, activity, were, mainly, in, germany, as, often, seen, at, the, end, of, any, musical, era, the, end, of, the, medieval, era, is, marked, by, a, highly, manneristic, style, known, as, ars, subtilior, in, some, ways, this, was, an, attempt, to, meld, the, french, and, italian, styles, this, music, was, highly, stylized, with, a, rhythmic, complexity, that, was, not, matched, until, the, 20th, century, in, fact, not, only, was, the, rhythmic, complexity, of, this, repertoire, largely, unmatched, for, five, and, a, half, centuries, with, extreme, syncopations, mensural, trickery, and, even, examples, of, augenmusik, such, as, a, chanson, by, baude, cordier, written, out, in, manuscript, in, the, shape, of, a, heart, but, also, its, melodic, material, was, quite, complex, as, well, particularly, in, its, interaction, with, the, rhythmic, structures, already, discussed, under, ars, nova, has, been, the, practice, of, isorhythm, which, continued, to, develop, through, late, century, and, in, fact, did, not, achieve, its, highest, degree, of, sophistication, until, early, in, the, 15th, century, instead, of, using, isorhythmic, techniques, in, one, or, two, voices, or, trading, them, among, voices, some, works, came, to, feature, a, pervading, isorhythmic, texture, which, rivals, the, integral, serialism, of, the, 20th, century, in, its, systematic, ordering, of, rhythmic, and, tonal, elements, the, term, mannerism, was, applied, by, later, scholars, as, it, often, is, in, response, to, an, impression, of, sophistication, being, practised, for, its, own, sake, a, malady, which, some, authors, have, felt, infected, the, ars, subtilior, one, of, the, most, important, extant, sources, of, ars, subtilior, chansons, is, the, chantilly, codex, for, information, about, specific, composers, writing, music, in, ars, subtilior, style, see, anthonello, de, caserta, philippus, de, caserta, aka, philipoctus, de, caserta, johannes, ciconia, matteo, da, perugia, lorenzo, da, firenze, grimace, jacob, senleches, and, baude, cordier, demarcating, the, end, of, the, medieval, era, and, the, beginning, of, the, renaissance, era, with, regard, to, the, composition, of, music, is, difficult, while, the, music, of, the, fourteenth, century, is, fairly, obviously, medieval, in, conception, the, music, of, the, early, fifteenth, century, is, often, conceived, as, belonging, to, a, transitional, period, not, only, retaining, some, of, the, ideals, of, the, end, of, the, middle, ages, such, as, a, type, of, polyphonic, writing, in, which, the, parts, differ, widely, from, each, other, in, character, as, each, has, its, specific, textural, function, but, also, showing, some, of, the, characteristic, traits, of, the, renaissance, such, as, the, increasingly, international, style, developing, through, the, diffusion, of, franco, flemish, musicians, throughout, europe, and, in, terms, of, texture, an, increasing, equality, of, parts, music, historians, do, not, agree, on, when, the, renaissance, era, began, but, most, historians, agree, that, england, was, still, a, medieval, society, in, the, early, fifteenth, century, see, periodization, issues, of, the, middle, ages, while, there, is, no, consensus, 1400, is, a, useful, marker, because, it, was, around, that, time, that, the, renaissance, came, into, full, swing, in, italy, the, increasing, reliance, on, the, interval, of, the, third, as, a, consonance, is, one, of, the, most, pronounced, features, of, transition, into, the, renaissance, polyphony, in, use, since, the, 12th, century, became, increasingly, elaborate, with, highly, independent, voices, throughout, the, 14th, century, with, john, dunstaple, and, other, english, composers, partly, through, the, local, technique, of, faburden, an, improvisatory, process, in, which, a, chant, melody, and, a, written, part, predominantly, in, parallel, sixths, above, it, are, ornamented, by, one, sung, in, perfect, fourths, below, the, latter, and, which, later, took, hold, on, the, continent, as, fauxbordon, the, interval, of, the, third, emerges, as, an, important, musical, development, because, of, this, contenance, angloise, english, countenance, english, composers, music, is, often, regarded, as, the, first, to, sound, less, truly, bizarre, to, 2000s, era, audiences, who, are, not, trained, in, music, history, english, stylistic, tendencies, in, this, regard, had, come, to, fruition, and, began, to, influence, continental, composers, as, early, as, the, 1420s, as, can, be, seen, in, works, of, the, young, dufay, among, others, while, the, hundred, years, war, continued, english, nobles, armies, their, chapels, and, retinues, and, therefore, some, of, their, composers, travelled, in, france, and, performed, their, music, there, it, must, also, of, course, be, remembered, that, the, english, controlled, portions, of, northern, france, at, this, time, english, manuscripts, include, the, worcester, fragments, the, old, st, andrews, music, book, the, old, hall, manuscript, and, egerton, manuscript, for, information, about, specific, composers, who, are, considered, transitional, between, the, medieval, and, the, renaissance, see, zacara, da, teramo, paolo, da, firenze,

and, is, often, considered, the, most, influential, composer, between, dufay, and, josquin, des, prez, ockeghem, probably, studied, with, gilles, binchois, and, at, least, was, closely, associated,
