art, is, a, diverse, range, of, human, activity, and, its, resulting, product, that, involves, creative, or, imaginative, talent, generally, expressive, of, technical, proficiency, beauty, emotional, power, or, conceptual, ideas, there, is, no, generally, agreed, definition, of, what, constitutes, art, and, its, interpretation, has, varied, greatly, throughout, history, and, across, cultures, in, the, western, tradition, the, three, classical, branches, of, visual, art, are, painting, sculpture, and, architecture, theatre, dance, and, other, performing, arts, as, well, as, literature, music, film, and, other, media, such, as, interactive, media, are, included, in, a, broader, definition, of, the, arts, until, the, 17th, century, art, referred, to, any, skill, or, mastery, and, was, not, differentiated, from, crafts, or, sciences, in, modern, usage, after, the, 17th, century, where, aesthetic, considerations, are, paramount, the, fine, arts, are, separated, and, distinguished, from, acquired, skills, in, general, such, as, the, decorative, or, applied, arts, the, nature, of, art, and, related, concepts, such, as, creativity, and, interpretation, are, explored, in, a, branch, of, philosophy, known, as, aesthetics, the, resulting, artworks, are, studied, in, the, professional, fields, of, art, criticism, and, the, history, of, art, in, the, perspective, of, the, history, of, art, artistic, works, have, existed, for, almost, as, long, as, humankind, from, early, prehistoric, art, to, contemporary, art, however, some, theorists, think, that, the, typical, concept, of, artistic, works, does, not, fit, well, outside, modern, western, societies, one, early, sense, of, the, definition, of, art, is, closely, related, to, the, older, latin, meaning, which, roughly, translates, to, skill, or, craft, as, associated, with, words, such, as, artisan, english, words, derived, from, this, meaning, include, artifact, artificial, artifice, medical, arts, and, military, arts, however, there, are, many, other, colloquial, uses, of, the, word, all, with, some, relation, to, its, etymology, over, time, philosophers, like, plato, aristotle, socrates, and, immanuel, kant, among, others, questioned, the, meaning, of, art, several, dialogues, in, plato, tackle, questions, about, art, while, socrates, says, that, poetry, is, inspired, by, the, muses, and, is, not, rational, he, speaks, approvingly, of, this, and, other, forms, of, divine, madness, drunkenness, eroticism, and, dreaming, in, the, phaedrus, 265a, c, and, yet, in, the, republic, wants, to, outlaw, homer, s, great, poetic, art, and, laughter, as, well, in, ion, socrates, gives, no, hint, of, the, disapproval, of, homer, that, he, expresses, in, the, republic, the, dialogue, ion, suggests, that, homer, s, iliad, functioned, in, the, ancient, greek, world, as, the, bible, does, today, in, the, modern, christian, world, as, divinely, inspired, literary, art, that, can, provide, moral, guidance, if, only, it, can, be, properly, interpreted, with, regards, to, the, literary, art, and, the, musical, arts, aristotle, considered, epic, poetry, tragedy, comedy, dithyrambic, poetry, and, music, to, be, mimetic, or, imitative, art, each, varying, in, imitation, by, medium, object, and, manner, for, example, music, imitates, with, the, media, of, rhythm, and, harmony, whereas, dance, imitates, with, rhythm, alone, and, poetry, with, language, the, forms, also, differ, in, their, object, of, imitation, comedy, for, instance, is, a, dramatic, imitation, of, men, worse, than, average, whereas, tragedy, imitates, men, slightly, better, than, average, lastly, the, forms, differ, in, their, manner, of, imitation, through, narrative, or, character, through, change, or, no, change, and, through, drama, or, no, drama, aristotle, believed, that, imitation, is, natural, to, mankind, and, constitutes, one, of, mankind, s, advantages, over, animals, the, more, recent, and, specific, sense, of, the, word, art, as, an, abbreviation, for, creative, art, or, fine, art, emerged, in, the, early, 17th, century, fine, art, refers, to, a, skill, used, to, express, the, artist, s, creativity, or, to, engage, the, audience, s, aesthetic, sensibilities, or, to, draw, the, audience, towards, consideration, of, more, refined, or, finer, works, of, art, within, this, latter, sense, the, word, art, may, refer, to, several, things, i, a, study, of, a, creative, skill, ii, a, process, of, using, the, creative, skill, iii, a, product, of, the, creative, skill, or, iv, the, audience, s, experience, with, the, creative, skill, the, creative, arts, art, as, discipline, are, a, collection, of, disciplines, which, produce, artworks, art, as, objects, that, are, compelled, by, a, personal, drive, art, as, activity, and, convey, a, message, mood, or, symbolism, for, the, perceiver, to, interpret, art, as, experience, art, is, something, that, stimulates, an, individual, s, thoughts, emotions, beliefs, or, ideas, through, the, senses, works, of, art, can, be, explicitly, made, for, this, purpose, or, interpreted, on, the, basis, of, images, or, objects, for, some, scholars, such, as, kant, the, sciences, and, the, arts, could, be, distinguished, by, taking, science, as, representing, the, domain, of, knowledge, and, the, arts, as, representing, the, domain, of, the, freedom, of, artistic, expression, often, if, the, skill, is, being, used, in, a, common, or, practical, way, people, will, consider, it, a, craft, instead, of, art, likewise, if, the, skill, is, being, used, in, a, commercial, or, industrial, way, it, may, be, considered, commercial, art, instead, of, fine, art, on, the, other, hand, crafts, and, design, are, sometimes, considered, applied, art, some, art, followers, have, argued, that, the, difference, between, fine, art, and, applied, art, has, more, to, do, with, value, judgments, made, about, the, art, than, any, clear, definitional, difference, however, even, fine, art, often, has, goals, beyond, pure, creativity, and, self, expression, the, purpose, of, works, of, art, may, be, to, communicate, ideas, such, as, in, politically, spiritually, or, philosophically, motivated, art, to, create, a, sense, of, beauty, see, aesthetics, to, explore, the, nature, of, perception, for, pleasure, or, to, generate, strong, emotions, the, purpose, may, also, be, seemingly, nonexistent, the, nature, of, art, has, been, described, by, philosopher, richard, wollheim, as, one, of, the, most, elusive, of, the, traditional, problems, of, human, culture, art, has, been, defined, as, a, vehicle, for, the, expression, or, communication, of, emotions, and, ideas, a, means, for, exploring, and, appreciating, formal, elements, for, their, own, sake, and, as, mimesis, or, representation, art, as, mimesis, has, deep, roots, in, the, philosophy, of, aristotle, leo, tolstoy, identified, art, as, a, use, of, indirect, means, to, communicate, from, one, person, to, another, benedetto, croce, and, r, g, collingwood, advanced, the, idealist, view, that, art, expresses, emotions, and, that, the, work, of, art, therefore, essentially, exists, in, the, mind, of, the, creator, the, theory, of, art, as, form, has, its, roots, in, the, philosophy, of, kant, and, was, developed, in, the, early, 20th, century, by, roger, fry, and, clive, bell, more, recently, thinkers, influenced, by, martin, heidegger, have, interpreted, art, as, the, means, by, which, a, community, develops, for, itself, a, medium, for, self, expression, and, interpretation, george, dickie, has, offered, an, institutional, theory, of, art, that, defines, a, work, of, art, as, any, artifact, upon, which, a, qualified, person, or, persons, acting, on, behalf, of, the, social, institution, commonly, referred, to, as, the, art, world, has, conferred, the, status, of, candidate, for, appreciation, larry, shiner, has, described, fine, art, as, not, an, essence, or, a, fate, but, something, we, have, made, art, as, we, have, generally, understood, it, is, a, european, invention, barely, two, hundred, years, old, art, may, be, characterized, in, terms, of, mimesis, its, representation, of, reality, narrative, storytelling, expression, communication, of, emotion, or, other, qualities, during, the, romantic, period, art, came, to, be, seen, as, a, special, faculty, of, the, human, mind, to, be, classified, with, religion, and, science, a, shell, engraved, by, homo, erectus, was, determined, to, be, between, 430, 000, and, 540, 000, years, old, a, set, of, eight, 130, 000, years, old, white, tailed, eagle, talons, bear, cut, marks, and, abrasion, that, indicate, manipulation, by, neanderthals, possibly, for, using, it, as, jewelry, a, series, of, tiny, drilled, snail, shells, about, 75, 000, years, old, were, discovered, in, a, south, african, cave, containers, that, may, have, been, used, to, hold, paints, have, been, found, dating, as, far, back, as, 100, 000, years, the, oldest, piece, of, art, found, in, europe, is, the, riesenhirschknochen, der, einhornh, hle, dating, back, 51, 000, years, and, made, by, neanderthals, sculptures, cave, paintings, rock, paintings, and, petroglyphs, from, the, upper, paleolithic, dating, to, roughly, 40, 000, years, ago, have, been, found, but, the, precise, meaning, of, such, art, is, often, disputed, because, so, little, is, known, about, the, cultures, that, produced, them, the, first, undisputed, sculptures, and, similar, art, pieces, like, the, venus, of, hohle, fels, are, the, numerous, objects, found, at, the, caves, and, ice, age, art, in, the, swabian, jura, unesco, world, heritage, site, where, the, oldest, non, stationary, works, of, human, art, yet, discovered, were, found, in, the, form, of, carved, animal, and, humanoid, figurines, in, addition, to, the, oldest, musical, instruments, unearthed, so, far, with, the, artifacts, dating, between, 43, 000, and, 35, 000, bc, so, being, the, first, centre, of, human, art, many, great, traditions, in, art, have, a, foundation, in, the, art, of, one, of, the, great, ancient, civilizations, ancient, egypt, mesopotamia, persia, india, china, ancient, greece, rome, as, well, as, inca, maya, and, olmec, each, of, these, centers, of, early, civilization, developed, a, unique, and, characteristic, style, in, its, art, because, of, the, size, and, duration, of, these, civilizations, more, of, their, art, works, have, survived, and, more, of, their, influence, has, been, transmitted, to, other, cultures, and, later, times, some, also, have, provided, the, first, records, of, how, artists, worked, for, example, this, period, of, greek, art, saw, a, veneration, of, the, human, physical, form, and, the, development, of, equivalent, skills, to, show, musculature, poise, beauty, and, anatomically, correct, proportions, in, byzantine, and, medieval, art, of, the, western, middle, ages, much, art, focused, on, the, expression, of, subjects, about, biblical, and, religious, culture, and, used, styles, that, showed, the, higher, glory, of, a, heavenly, world, such, as, the, use, of, gold, in, the, background, of, paintings, or, glass, in, mosaics, or, windows, which, also, presented, figures, in, idealized, patterned, flat, forms, nevertheless, a, classical, realist, tradition, persisted, in, small, byzantine, works, and, realism, steadily, grew, in, the, art, of, catholic, europe, renaissance, art, had, a, greatly, increased, emphasis, on, the, realistic, depiction, of, the, material, world, and, the, place, of, humans, in, it, reflected, in, the, corporeality, of, the, human, body, and, development, of, a, systematic, method, of, graphical, perspective, to, depict, recession, in, a, three, dimensional, picture, space, in, the, east, islamic, art, s, rejection, of, iconography, led, to, emphasis, on, geometric, patterns, calligraphy, and, architecture, further, east, religion, dominated, artistic, styles, and, forms, too, india, and, tibet, saw, emphasis, on, painted, sculptures, and, dance, while, religious, painting, borrowed, many, conventions, from, sculpture, and, tended, to, bright, contrasting, colors, with, emphasis, on, outlines, china, saw, the, flourishing, of, many, art, forms, jade, carving, bronzework, pottery, including, the, stunning, terracotta, army, of, emperor, qin, poetry, calligraphy, music, painting, drama, fiction, etc, chinese, styles, vary, greatly, from, era, to, era, and, each, one, is, traditionally, named, after, the, ruling, dynasty, so, for, example, tang, dynasty, paintings, are, monochromatic, and, sparse, emphasizing, idealized, landscapes, but, ming, dynasty, paintings, are, busy, and, colorful, and, focus, on, telling, stories, via, setting, and, composition, japan, names, its, styles, after, imperial, dynasties, too, and, also, saw, much, interplay, between, the, styles, of, calligraphy, and, painting, woodblock, printing, became, important, in, japan, after, the, 17th, century, the, western, age, of, enlightenment, in, the, 18th, century, saw, artistic, depictions, of, physical, and, rational, certainties, of, the, clockwork, universe, as, well, as, politically, revolutionary, visions, of, a, post, monarchist, world, such, as, blake, s, portrayal, of, newton, as, a, divine, geometer, or, david, s, propagandistic, paintings, this, led, to, romantic, rejections, of, this, in, favor, of, pictures, of, the, emotional, side, and, individuality, of, humans, exemplified, in, the, novels, of, goethe, the, late, 19th, century, then, saw, a, host, of, artistic, movements, such, as, academic, art, symbolism, impressionism, and, fauvism, among, others, the, history, of, 20th, century, art, is, a, narrative, of, endless, possibilities, and, the, search, for, new, standards, each, being, torn, down, in, succession, by, the, next, thus, the, parameters, of, impressionism, expressionism, fauvism, cubism, dadaism, surrealism, etc, cannot, be, maintained, very, much, beyond, the, time, of, their, invention, increasing, global, interaction, during, this, time, saw, an, equivalent, influence, of, other, cultures, into, western, art, thus, japanese, woodblock, prints, themselves, influenced, by, western, renaissance, draftsmanship, had, an, immense, influence, on, impressionism, and, subsequent, development, later, african, sculptures, were, taken, up, by, picasso, and, to, some, extent, by, matisse, similarly, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, the, west, has, had, huge, impacts, on, eastern, art, with, originally, western, ideas, like, communism, and, post, modernism, exerting, a, powerful, influence, modernism, the, idealistic, search, for, truth, gave, way, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 20th, century, to, a, realization, of, its, unattainability, theodor, w, adorno, said, in, 1970, it, is, now, taken, for, granted, that, nothing, which, concerns, art, can, be, taken, for, granted, any, more, neither, art, itself, nor, art, in, relationship, to, the, whole, nor, even, the, right, of, art, to, exist, relativism, was, accepted, as, an, unavoidable, truth, which, led, to, the, period, of, contemporary, art, and, postmodern, criticism, where, cultures, of, the, world, and, of, history, are, seen, as, changing, forms, which, can, be, appreciated, and, drawn, from, only, with, skepticism, and, irony, furthermore, the, separation, of, cultures, is, increasingly, blurred, and, some, argue, it, is, now, more, appropriate, to, think, in, terms, of, a, global, culture, rather, than, of, regional, ones, in, the, origin, of, the, work, of, art, martin, heidegger, a, german, philosopher, and, seminal, thinker, describes, the, essence, of, art, in, terms, of, the, concepts, of, being, and, truth, he, argues, that, art, is, not, only, a, way, of, expressing, the, element, of, truth, in, a, culture, but, the, means, of, creating, it, and, providing, a, springboard, from, which, that, which, is, can, be, revealed, works, of, art, are, not, merely, representations, of, the, way, things, are, but, actually, produce, a, community, s, shared, understanding, each, time, a, new, artwork, is, added, to, any, culture, the, meaning, of, what, it, is, to, exist, is, inherently, changed, historically, art, and, artistic, skills, and, ideas, have, often, been, spread, through, trade, an, example, of, this, is, the, silk, road, where, hellenistic, iranian, indian, and, chinese, influences, could, mix, greco, buddhist, art, is, one, of, the, most, vivid, examples, of, this, interaction, the, meeting, of, different, cultures, and, worldviews, also, influenced, artistic, creation, an, example, of, this, is, the, multicultural, port, metropolis, of, trieste, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, where, james, joyce, met, writers, from, central, europe, and, the, artistic, development, of, new, york, city, as, a, cultural, melting, pot, the, creative, arts, are, often, divided, into, more, specific, categories, typically, along, perceptually, distinguishable, categories, such, as, media, genre, styles, and, form, art, form, refers, to, the, elements, of, art, that, are, independent, of, its, interpretation, or, significance, it, covers, the, methods, adopted, by, the, artist, and, the, physical, composition, of, the, artwork, primarily, non, semantic, aspects, of, the, work, i, e, figurae, such, as, color, contour, dimension, medium, melody, space, texture, and, value, form, may, also, include, design, principles, such, as, arrangement, balance, contrast, emphasis, harmony, proportion, proximity, and, rhythm, in, general, there, are, three, schools, of, philosophy, regarding, art, focusing, respectively, on, form, content, and, context, extreme, formalism, is, the, view, that, all, aesthetic, properties, of, art, are, formal, that, is, part, of, the, art, form, philosophers, almost, universally, reject, this, view, and, hold, that, the, properties, and, aesthetics, of, art, extend, beyond, materials, techniques, and, form, unfortunately, there, is, little, consensus, on, terminology, for, these, informal, properties, some, authors, refer, to, subject, matter, and, content, i, e, denotations, and, connotations, while, others, prefer, terms, like, meaning, and, significance, extreme, intentionalism, holds, that, authorial, intent, plays, a, decisive, role, in, the, meaning, of, a, work, of, art, conveying, the, content, or, essential, main, idea, while, all, other, interpretations, can, be, discarded, it, defines, the, subject, as, the, persons, or, idea, represented, and, the, content, as, the, artist, s, experience, of, that, subject, for, example, the, composition, of, napoleon, i, on, his, imperial, throne, is, partly, borrowed, from, the, statue, of, zeus, at, olympia, as, evidenced, by, the, title, the, subject, is, napoleon, and, the, content, is, ingres, s, representation, of, napoleon, as, emperor, god, beyond, time, and, space, similarly, to, extreme, formalism, philosophers, typically, reject, extreme, intentionalism, because, art, may, have, multiple, ambiguous, meanings, and, authorial, intent, may, be, unknowable, and, thus, irrelevant, its, restrictive, interpretation, is, socially, unhealthy, philosophically, unreal, and, politically, unwise, finally, the, developing, theory, of, post, structuralism, studies, art, s, significance, in, a, cultural, context, such, as, the, ideas, emotions, and, reactions, prompted, by, a, work, the, cultural, context, often, reduces, to, the, artist, s, techniques, and, intentions, in, which, case, analysis, proceeds, along, lines, similar, to, formalism, and, intentionalism, however, in, other, cases, historical, and, material, conditions, may, predominate, such, as, religious, and, philosophical, convictions, sociopolitical, and, economic, structures, or, even, climate, and, geography, art, criticism, continues, to, grow, and, develop, alongside, art, art, can, connote, a, sense, of, trained, ability, or, mastery, of, a, medium, art, can, also, refer, to, the, developed, and, efficient, use, of, a, language, to, convey, meaning, with, immediacy, or, depth, art, can, be, defined, as, an, act, of, expressing, feelings, thoughts, and, observations, there, is, an, understanding, that, is, reached, with, the, material, as, a, result, of, handling, it, which, facilitates, one, s, thought, processes, a, common, view, is, that, the, epithet, art, particular, in, its, elevated, sense, requires, a, certain, level, of, creative, expertise, by, the, artist, whether, this, be, a, demonstration, of, technical, ability, an, originality, in, stylistic, approach, or, a, combination, of, these, two, traditionally, skill, of, execution, was, viewed, as, a, quality, inseparable, from, art, and, thus, necessary, for, its, success, for, leonardo, da, vinci, art, neither, more, nor, less, than, his, other, endeavors, was, a, manifestation, of, skill, rembrandt, s, work, now, praised, for, its, ephemeral, virtues, was, most, admired, by, his, contemporaries, for, its, virtuosity, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, the, adroit, performances, of, john, singer, sargent, were, alternately, admired, and, viewed, with, skepticism, for, their, manual, fluency, yet, at, nearly, the, same, time, the, artist, who, would, become, the, era, s, most, recognized, and, peripatetic, iconoclast, pablo, picasso, was, completing, a, traditional, academic, training, at, which, he, excelled, a, common, contemporary, criticism, of, some, modern, art, occurs, along, the, lines, of, objecting, to, the, apparent, lack, of, skill, or, ability, required, in, the, production, of, the, artistic, object, in, conceptual, art, marcel, duchamp, s, fountain, is, among, the, first, examples, of, pieces, wherein, the, artist, used, found, objects, ready, made, and, exercised, no, traditionally, recognised, set, of, skills, tracey, emin, s, my, bed, or, damien, hirst, s, the, physical, impossibility, of, death, in, the, mind, of, someone, living, follow, this, example, emin, slept, and, engaged, in, other, activities, in, her, bed, before, placing, the, result, in, a, gallery, as, work, of, art, hirst, came, up, with, the, conceptual, design, for, the, artwork, but, has, left, most, of, the, eventual, creation, of, many, works, to, employed, artisans, hirst, s, celebrity, is, founded, entirely, on, his, ability, to, produce, shocking, concepts, the, actual, production, in, many, conceptual, and, contemporary, works, of, art, is, a, matter, of, assembly, of, found, objects, however, there, are, many, modernist, and, contemporary, artists, who, continue, to, excel, in, the, skills, of, drawing, and, painting, and, in, creating, hands, on, works, of, art, art, has, had, a, great, number, of, different, functions, throughout, its, history, making, its, purpose, difficult, to, abstract, or, quantify, to, any, single, concept, this, does, not, imply, that, the, purpose, of, art, is, vague, but, that, it, has, had, many, unique, different, reasons, for, being, created, some, of, these, functions, of, art, are, provided, in, the, following, outline, the, different, purposes, of, art, may, be, grouped, according, to, those, that, are, non, motivated, and, those, that, are, motivated, l, vi, strauss, the, non, motivated, purposes, of, art, are, those, that, are, integral, to, being, human, transcend, the, individual, or, do, not, fulfill, a, specific, external, purpose, in, this, sense, art, as, creativity, is, something, humans, must, do, by, their, very, nature, i, e, no, other, species, creates, art, and, is, therefore, beyond, utility, imitation, then, is, one, instinct, of, our, nature, next, there, is, the, instinct, for, harmony, and, rhythm, meters, being, manifestly, sections, of, rhythm, persons, therefore, starting, with, this, natural, gift, developed, by, degrees, their, special, aptitudes, till, their, rude, improvisations, gave, birth, to, poetry, aristotle, the, most, beautiful, thing, we, can, experience, is, the, mysterious, it, is, the, source, of, all, true, art, and, science, albert, einstein, jupiter, s, eagle, is, not, like, logical, aesthetic, attributes, of, an, object, the, concept, of, the, sublimity, and, majesty, of, creation, but, rather, something, else, something, that, gives, the, imagination, an, incentive, to, spread, its, flight, over, a, whole, host, of, kindred, representations, that, provoke, more, thought, than, admits, of, expression, in, a, concept, determined, by, words, they, furnish, an, aesthetic, idea, which, serves, the, above, rational, idea, as, a, substitute, for, logical, presentation, but, with, the, proper, function, however, of, animating, the, mind, by, opening, out, for, it, a, prospect, into, a, field, of, kindred, representations, stretching, beyond, its, ken, immanuel, kant, most, scholars, who, deal, with, rock, paintings, or, objects, recovered, from, prehistoric, contexts, that, cannot, be, explained, in, utilitarian, terms, and, are, thus, categorized, as, decorative, ritual, or, symbolic, are, aware, of, the, trap, posed, by, the, term, art, silva, tomaskova, motivated, purposes, of, art, refer, to, intentional, conscious, actions, on, the, part, of, the, artists, or, creator, these, may, be, to, bring, about, political, change, to, comment, on, an, aspect, of, society, to, convey, a, specific, emotion, or, mood, to, address, personal, psychology, to, illustrate, another, discipline, to, with, commercial, arts, sell, a, product, or, used, as, a, form, of, communication, artefacts, or, images, with, symbolic, meanings, as, a, means, of, communication, steve, mithen, by, contrast, the, realistic, attitude, inspired, by, positivism, from, saint, thomas, aquinas, to, anatole, france, clearly, seems, to, me, to, be, hostile, to, any, intellectual, or, moral, advancement, i, loathe, it, for, it, is, made, up, of, mediocrity, hate, and, dull, conceit, it, is, this, attitude, which, today, gives, birth, to, these, ridiculous, books, these, insulting, plays, it, constantly, feeds, on, and, derives, strength, from, the, newspapers, and, stultifies, both, science, and, art, by, assiduously, flattering, the, lowest, of, tastes, clarity, bordering, on, stupidity, a, dog, s, life, andr, breton, surrealism, the, functions, of, art, described, above, are, not, mutually, exclusive, as, many, of, them, may, overlap, for, example, art, for, the, purpose, of, entertainment, may, also, seek, to, sell, a, product, i, e, the, movie, or, video, game, art, can, be, divided, into, any, number, of, steps, one, can, make, an, argument, for, this, section, divides, the, creative, process, into, broad, three, steps, but, there, is, no, consensus, on, an, exact, number, in, the, first, step, the, artist, envisions, the, art, in, their, mind, by, imagining, what, their, art, would, look, like, the, artist, begins, the, process, of, bringing, the, art, into, existence, preparation, of, art, may, involve, approaching, and, researching, the, subject, matter, artistic, inspiration, is, one, of, the, main, drivers, of, art, and, may, be, considered, to, stem, from, instinct, impressions, and, feelings, in, the, second, step, the, artist, executes, the, creation, of, their, work, the, creation, of, a, piece, can, be, affected, by, factors, such, as, the, artist, s, mood, surroundings, and, mental, state, for, example, the, black, paintings, by, francisco, de, goya, created, in, the, elder, years, of, his, life, are, thought, to, be, so, bleak, because, he, was, in, isolation, and, because, of, his, experience, with, war, he, painted, them, directly, on, the, walls, of, his, apartment, in, spain, and, most, likely, never, discussed, them, with, anyone, the, beatles, stated, drugs, such, as, lsd, and, cannabis, influenced, some, of, their, greatest, hits, such, as, revolver, trial, and, error, are, considered, an, integral, part, of, the, creation, process, the, last, step, is, art, appreciation, which, has, the, sub, topic, of, critique, in, one, study, over, half, of, visual, arts, students, agreed, that, reflection, is, an, essential, step, of, the, art, process, according, to, education, journals, the, reflection, of, art, is, considered, an, essential, part, of, the, experience, however, an, important, aspect, of, art, is, that, others, may, view, and, appreciate, it, as, well, while, many, focus, on, whether, those, viewing, listening, etc, believe, the, art, to, be, good, successful, or, not, art, has, profound, value, beyond, its, commercial, success, as, a, provider, of, information, and, health, in, society, art, enjoyment, can, bring, about, a, wide, spectrum, of, emotion, due, to, beauty, some, art, is, meant, to, be, practical, with, its, analysis, studious, meant, to, stimulate, discourse, since, ancient, times, much, of, the, finest, art, has, represented, a, deliberate, display, of, wealth, or, power, often, achieved, by, using, massive, scale, and, expensive, materials, much, art, has, been, commissioned, by, political, rulers, or, religious, establishments, with, more, modest, versions, only, available, to, the, most, wealthy, in, society, nevertheless, there, have, been, many, periods, where, art, of, very, high, quality, was, available, in, terms, of, ownership, across, large, parts, of, society, above, all, in, cheap, media, such, as, pottery, which, persists, in, the, ground, and, perishable, media, such, as, textiles, and, wood, in, many, different, cultures, the, ceramics, of, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, are, found, in, such, a, wide, range, of, graves, that, they, were, clearly, not, restricted, to, a, social, elite, though, other, forms, of, art, may, have, been, reproductive, methods, such, as, moulds, made, mass, production, easier, and, were, used, to, bring, high, quality, ancient, roman, pottery, and, greek, tanagra, figurines, to, a, very, wide, market, cylinder, seals, were, both, artistic, and, practical, and, very, widely, used, by, what, can, be, loosely, called, the, middle, class, in, the, ancient, near, east, once, coins, were, widely, used, these, also, became, an, art, form, that, reached, the, widest, range, of, society, another, important, innovation, came, in, the, 15th, century, in, europe, when, printmaking, began, with, small, woodcuts, mostly, religious, that, were, often, very, small, and, hand, colored, and, affordable, even, by, peasants, who, glued, them, to, the, walls, of, their, homes, printed, books, were, initially, very, expensive, but, fell, steadily, in, price, until, by, the, 19th, century, even, the, poorest, could, afford, some, with, printed, illustrations, popular, prints, of, many, different, sorts, have, decorated, homes, and, other, places, for, centuries, in, 1661, the, city, of, basel, in, switzerland, opened, the, first, public, museum, of, art, in, the, world, the, kunstmuseum, basel, today, its, collection, is, distinguished, by, an, impressively, wide, historic, span, from, the, early, 15th, century, up, to, the, immediate, present, its, various, areas, of, emphasis, give, it, international, standing, as, one, of, the, most, significant, museums, of, its, kind, these, encompass, paintings, and, drawings, by, artists, active, in, the, upper, rhine, region, between, 1400, and, 1600, and, on, the, art, of, the, 19th, to, 21st, centuries, public, buildings, and, monuments, secular, and, religious, by, their, nature, normally, address, the, whole, of, society, and, visitors, as, viewers, and, display, to, the, general, public, has, long, been, an, important, factor, in, their, design, egyptian, temples, are, typical, in, that, the, most, largest, and, most, lavish, decoration, was, placed, on, the, parts, that, could, be, seen, by, the, general, public, rather, than, the, areas, seen, only, by, the, priests, many, areas, of, royal, palaces, castles, and, the, houses, of, the, social, elite, were, often, generally, accessible, and, large, parts, of, the, art, collections, of, such, people, could, often, be, seen, either, by, anybody, or, by, those, able, to, pay, a, small, price, or, those, wearing, the, correct, clothes, regardless, of, who, they, were, as, at, the, palace, of, versailles, where, the, appropriate, extra, accessories, silver, shoe, buckles, and, a, sword, could, be, hired, from, shops, outside, special, arrangements, were, made, to, allow, the, public, to, see, many, royal, or, private, collections, placed, in, galleries, as, with, the, orleans, collection, mostly, housed, in, a, wing, of, the, palais, royal, in, paris, which, could, be, visited, for, most, of, the, 18th, century, in, italy, the, art, tourism, of, the, grand, tour, became, a, major, industry, from, the, renaissance, onwards, and, governments, and, cities, made, efforts, to, make, their, key, works, accessible, the, british, royal, collection, remains, distinct, but, large, donations, such, as, the, old, royal, library, were, made, from, it, to, the, british, museum, established, in, 1753, the, uffizi, in, florence, opened, entirely, as, a, gallery, in, 1765, though, this, function, had, been, gradually, taking, the, building, over, from, the, original, civil, servants, offices, for, a, long, time, before, the, building, now, occupied, by, the, prado, in, madrid, was, built, before, the, french, revolution, for, the, public, display, of, parts, of, the, royal, art, collection, and, similar, royal, galleries, open, to, the, public, existed, in, vienna, munich, and, other, capitals, the, opening, of, the, mus, e, du, louvre, during, the, french, revolution, in, 1793, as, a, public, museum, for, much, of, the, former, french, royal, collection, certainly, marked, an, important, stage, in, the, development, of, public, access, to, art, transferring, ownership, to, a, republican, state, but, was, a, continuation, of, trends, already, well, established, most, modern, public, museums, and, art, education, programs, for, children, in, schools, can, be, traced, back, to, this, impulse, to, have, art, available, to, everyone, however, museums, do, not, only, provide, availability, to, art, but, do, also, influence, the, way, art, is, being, perceived, by, the, audience, as, studies, found, thus, the, museum, itself, is, not, only, a, blunt, stage, for, the, presentation, of, art, but, plays, an, active, and, vital, role, in, the, overall, perception, of, art, in, modern, society, museums, in, the, united, states, tend, to, be, gifts, from, the, very, rich, to, the, masses, the, metropolitan, museum, of, art, in, new, york, city, for, example, was, created, by, john, taylor, johnston, a, railroad, executive, whose, personal, art, collection, seeded, the, museum, but, despite, all, this, at, least, one, of, the, important, functions, of, art, in, the, 21st, century, remains, as, a, marker, of, wealth, and, social, status, there, have, been, attempts, by, artists, to, create, art, that, can, not, be, bought, by, the, wealthy, as, a, status, object, one, of, the, prime, original, motivators, of, much, of, the, art, of, the, late, 1960s, and, 1970s, was, to, create, art, that, could, not, be, bought, and, sold, it, is, necessary, to, present, something, more, than, mere, objects, said, the, major, post, war, german, artist, joseph, beuys, this, time, period, saw, the, rise, of, such, things, as, performance, art, video, art, and, conceptual, art, the, idea, was, that, if, the, artwork, was, a, performance, that, would, leave, nothing, behind, or, was, an, idea, it, could, not, be, bought, and, sold, democratic, precepts, revolving, around, the, idea, that, a, work, of, art, is, a, commodity, impelled, the, aesthetic, innovation, which, germinated, in, the, mid, 1960s, and, was, reaped, throughout, the, 1970s, artists, broadly, identified, under, the, heading, of, conceptual, art, substituting, performance, and, publishing, activities, for, engagement, with, both, the, material, and, materialistic, concerns, of, painted, or, sculptural, form, endeavored, to, undermine, the, art, object, qua, object, in, the, decades, since, these, ideas, have, been, somewhat, lost, as, the, art, market, has, learned, to, sell, limited, edition, dvds, of, video, works, invitations, to, exclusive, performance, art, pieces, and, the, objects, left, over, from, conceptual, pieces, many, of, these, performances, create, works, that, are, only, understood, by, the, elite, who, have, been, educated, as, to, why, an, idea, or, video, or, piece, of, apparent, garbage, may, be, considered, art, the, marker, of, status, becomes, understanding, the, work, instead, of, necessarily, owning, it, and, the, artwork, remains, an, upper, class, activity, with, the, widespread, use, of, dvd, recording, technology, in, the, early, 2000s, artists, and, the, gallery, system, that, derives, its, profits, from, the, sale, of, artworks, gained, an, important, means, of, controlling, the, sale, of, video, and, computer, artworks, in, limited, editions, to, collectors, art, has, long, been, controversial, that, is, to, say, disliked, by, some, viewers, for, a, wide, variety, of, reasons, though, most, pre, modern, controversies, are, dimly, recorded, or, completely, lost, to, a, modern, view, iconoclasm, is, the, destruction, of, art, that, is, disliked, for, a, variety, of, reasons, including, religious, ones, aniconism, is, a, general, dislike, of, either, all, figurative, images, or, often, just, religious, ones, and, has, been, a, thread, in, many, major, religions, it, has, been, a, crucial, factor, in, the, history, of, islamic, art, where, depictions, of, muhammad, remain, especially, controversial, much, art, has, been, disliked, purely, because, it, depicted, or, otherwise, stood, for, unpopular, rulers, parties, or, other, groups, artistic, conventions, have, often, been, conservative, and, taken, very, seriously, by, art, critics, though, often, much, less, so, by, a, wider, public, the, iconographic, content, of, art, could, cause, controversy, as, with, late, medieval, depictions, of, the, new, motif, of, the, swoon, of, the, virgin, in, scenes, of, the, crucifixion, of, jesus, the, last, judgment, by, michelangelo, was, controversial, for, various, reasons, including, breaches, of, decorum, through, nudity, and, the, apollo, like, pose, of, christ, the, content, of, much, formal, art, through, history, was, dictated, by, the, patron, or, commissioner, rather, than, just, the, artist, but, with, the, advent, of, romanticism, and, economic, changes, in, the, production, of, art, the, artists, vision, became, the, usual, determinant, of, the, content, of, his, art, increasing, the, incidence, of, controversies, though, often, reducing, their, significance, strong, incentives, for, perceived, originality, and, publicity, also, encouraged, artists, to, court, controversy, th, odore, g, ricault, s, raft, of, the, medusa, c, 1820, was, in, part, a, political, commentary, on, a, recent, event, douard, manet, s, le, d, jeuner, sur, l, herbe, 1863, was, considered, scandalous, not, because, of, the, nude, woman, but, because, she, is, seated, next, to, men, fully, dressed, in, the, clothing, of, the, time, rather, than, in, robes, of, the, antique, world, john, singer, sargent, s, madame, pierre, gautreau, madam, x, 1884, caused, a, controversy, over, the, reddish, pink, used, to, color, the, woman, s, ear, lobe, considered, far, too, suggestive, and, supposedly, ruining, the, high, society, model, s, reputation, the, gradual, abandonment, of, naturalism, and, the, depiction, of, realistic, representations, of, the, visual, appearance, of, subjects, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, led, to, a, rolling, controversy, lasting, for, over, a, century, in, the, 20th, century, pablo, picasso, s, guernica, 1937, used, arresting, cubist, techniques, and, stark, monochromatic, oils, to, depict, the, harrowing, consequences, of, a, contemporary, bombing, of, a, small, ancient, basque, town, leon, golub, s, interrogation, iii, 1981, depicts, a, female, nude, hooded, detainee, strapped, to, a, chair, her, legs, open, to, reveal, her, sexual, organs, surrounded, by, two, tormentors, dressed, in, everyday, clothing, andres, serrano, s, piss, christ, 1989, is, a, photograph, of, a, crucifix, sacred, to, the, christian, religion, and, representing, christ, s, sacrifice, and, final, suffering, submerged, in, a, glass, of, the, artist, s, own, urine, the, resulting, uproar, led, to, comments, in, the, united, states, senate, about, public, funding, of, the, arts, before, modernism, aesthetics, in, western, art, was, greatly, concerned, with, achieving, the, appropriate, balance, between, different, aspects, of, realism, or, truth, to, nature, and, the, ideal, ideas, as, to, what, the, appropriate, balance, is, have, shifted, to, and, fro, over, the, centuries, this, concern, is, largely, absent, in, other, traditions, of, art, the, aesthetic, theorist, john, ruskin, who, championed, what, he, saw, as, the, naturalism, of, j, m, w, turner, saw, art, s, role, as, the, communication, by, artifice, of, an, essential, truth, that, could, only, be, found, in, nature, the, definition, and, evaluation, of, art, has, become, especially, problematic, since, the, 20th, century, richard, wollheim, distinguishes, three, approaches, to, assessing, the, aesthetic, value, of, art, the, realist, whereby, aesthetic, quality, is, an, absolute, value, independent, of, any, human, view, the, objectivist, whereby, it, is, also, an, absolute, value, but, is, dependent, on, general, human, experience, and, the, relativist, position, whereby, it, is, not, an, absolute, value, but, depends, on, and, varies, with, the, human, experience, of, different, humans, the, arrival, of, modernism, in, the, late, 19th, century, led, to, a, radical, break, in, the, conception, of, the, function, of, art, and, then, again, in, the, late, 20th, century, with, the, advent, of, postmodernism, clement, greenberg, s, 1960, article, modernist, painting, defines, modern, art, as, the, use, of, characteristic, methods, of, a, discipline, to, criticize, the, discipline, itself, greenberg, originally, applied, this, idea, to, the, abstract, expressionist, movement, and, used, it, as, a, way, to, understand, and, justify, flat, non, illusionistic, abstract, painting, realistic, naturalistic, art, had, dissembled, the, medium, using, art, to, conceal, art, modernism, used, art, to, call, attention, to, art, the, limitations, that, constitute, the, medium, of, painting, the, flat, surface, the, shape, of, the, support, the, properties, of, the, pigment, were, treated, by, the, old, masters, as, negative, factors, that, could, be, acknowledged, only, implicitly, or, indirectly, under, modernism, these, same, limitations, came, to, be, regarded, as, positive, factors, and, were, acknowledged, openly, after, greenberg, several, important, art, theorists, emerged, such, as, michael, fried, t, j, clark, rosalind, krauss, linda, nochlin, and, griselda, pollock, among, others, though, only, originally, intended, as, a, way, of, understanding, a, specific, set, of, artists, greenberg, s, definition, of, modern, art, is, important, to, many, of, the, ideas, of, art, within, the, various, art, movements, of, the, 20th, century, and, early, 21st, century, pop, artists, like, andy, warhol, became, both, noteworthy, and, influential, through, work, including, and, possibly, critiquing, popular, culture, as, well, as, the, art, world, artists, of, the, 1980s, 1990s, and, 2000s, expanded, this, technique, of, self, criticism, beyond, high, art, to, all, cultural, image, making, including, fashion, images, comics, billboards, and, pornography, duchamp, once, proposed, that, art, is, any, activity, of, any, kind, everything, however, the, way, that, only, certain, activities, are, classified, today, as, art, is, a, social, construction, there, is, evidence, that, there, may, be, an, element, of, truth, to, this, in, the, invention, of, art, a, cultural, history, larry, shiner, examines, the, construction, of, the, modern, system, of, the, arts, i, e, fine, art, he, finds, evidence, that, the, older, system, of, the, arts, before, our, modern, system, fine, art, held, art, to, be, any, skilled, human, activity, for, example, ancient, greek, society, did, not, possess, the, term, art, but, techne, techne, can, be, understood, neither, as, art, or, craft, the, reason, being, that, the, distinctions, of, art, and, craft, are, historical, products, that, came, later, on, in, human, history, techne, included, painting, sculpting, and, music, but, also, cooking, medicine, horsemanship, geometry, carpentry, prophecy, and, farming, etc, following, duchamp, during, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, a, significant, shift, to, general, aesthetic, theory, took, place, which, attempted, to, apply, aesthetic, theory, between, various, forms, of, art, including, the, literary, arts, and, the, visual, arts, to, each, other, this, resulted, in, the, rise, of, the, new, criticism, school, and, debate, concerning, the, intentional, fallacy, at, issue, was, the, question, of, whether, the, aesthetic, intentions, of, the, artist, in, creating, the, work, of, art, whatever, its, specific, form, should, be, associated, with, the, criticism, and, evaluation, of, the, final, product, of, the, work, of, art, or, if, the, work, of, art, should, be, evaluated, on, its, own, merits, independent, of, the, intentions, of, the, artist, in, 1946, william, k, wimsatt, and, monroe, beardsley, published, a, classic, and, controversial, new, critical, essay, entitled, the, intentional, fallacy, in, which, they, argued, strongly, against, the, relevance, of, an, author, s, intention, or, intended, meaning, in, the, analysis, of, a, literary, work, for, wimsatt, and, beardsley, the, words, on, the, page, were, all, that, mattered, importation, of, meanings, from, outside, the, text, was, considered, irrelevant, and, potentially, distracting, in, another, essay, the, affective, fallacy, which, served, as, a, kind, of, sister, essay, to, the, intentional, fallacy, wimsatt, and, beardsley, also, discounted, the, reader, s, personal, emotional, reaction, to, a, literary, work, as, a, valid, means, of, analyzing, a, text, this, fallacy, would, later, be, repudiated, by, theorists, from, the, reader, response, school, of, literary, theory, ironically, one, of, the, leading, theorists, from, this, school, stanley, fish, was, himself, trained, by, new, critics, fish, criticizes, wimsatt, and, beardsley, in, his, 1970, essay, literature, in, the, reader, as, summarized, by, berys, gaut, and, paisley, livingston, in, their, essay, the, creation, of, art, structuralist, and, post, structuralists, theorists, and, critics, were, sharply, critical, of, many, aspects, of, new, criticism, beginning, with, the, emphasis, on, aesthetic, appreciation, and, the, so, called, autonomy, of, art, but, they, reiterated, the, attack, on, biographical, criticisms, assumption, that, the, artist, s, activities, and, experience, were, a, privileged, critical, topic, these, authors, contend, that, anti, intentionalists, such, as, formalists, hold, that, the, intentions, involved, in, the, making, of, art, are, irrelevant, or, peripheral, to, correctly, interpreting, art, so, details, of, the, act, of, creating, a, work, though, possibly, of, interest, in, themselves, have, no, bearing, on, the, correct, interpretation, of, the, work, gaut, and, livingston, define, the, intentionalists, as, distinct, from, formalists, stating, that, intentionalists, unlike, formalists, hold, that, reference, to, intentions, is, essential, in, fixing, the, correct, interpretation, of, works, they, quote, richard, wollheim, as, stating, that, the, task, of, criticism, is, the, reconstruction, of, the, creative, process, where, the, creative, process, must, in, turn, be, thought, of, as, something, not, stopping, short, of, but, terminating, on, the, work, of, art, itself, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, fostered, an, extensive, debate, known, as, the, linguistic, turn, controversy, or, the, innocent, eye, debate, in, the, philosophy, of, art, this, debate, discussed, the, encounter, of, the, work, of, art, as, being, determined, by, the, relative, extent, to, which, the, conceptual, encounter, with, the, work, of, art, dominates, over, the, perceptual, encounter, with, the, work, of, art, decisive, for, the, linguistic, turn, debate, in, art, history, and, the, humanities, were, the, works, of, yet, another, tradition, namely, the, structuralism, of, ferdinand, de, saussure, and, the, ensuing, movement, of, poststructuralism, in, 1981, the, artist, mark, tansey, created, a, work, of, art, titled, the, innocent, eye, as, a, criticism, of, the, prevailing, climate, of, disagreement, in, the, philosophy, of, art, during, the, closing, decades, of, the, 20th, century, influential, theorists, include, judith, butler, luce, irigaray, julia, kristeva, michel, foucault, and, jacques, derrida, the, power, of, language, more, specifically, of, certain, rhetorical, tropes, in, art, history, and, historical, discourse, was, explored, by, hayden, white, the, fact, that, language, is, not, a, transparent, medium, of, thought, had, been, stressed, by, a, very, different, form, of, philosophy, of, language, which, originated, in, the, works, of, johann, georg, hamann, and, wilhelm, von, humboldt, ernst, gombrich, and, nelson, goodman, in, his, book, languages, of, art, an, approach, to, a, theory, of, symbols, came, to, hold, that, the, conceptual, encounter, with, the, work, of, art, predominated, exclusively, over, the, perceptual, and, visual, encounter, with, the, work, of, art, during, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, he, was, challenged, on, the, basis, of, research, done, by, the, nobel, prize, winning, psychologist, roger, sperry, who, maintained, that, the, human, visual, encounter, was, not, limited, to, concepts, represented, in, language, alone, the, linguistic, turn, and, that, other, forms, of, psychological, representations, of, the, work, of, art, were, equally, defensible, and, demonstrable, sperry, s, view, eventually, prevailed, by, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, with, aesthetic, philosophers, such, as, nick, zangwill, strongly, defending, a, return, to, moderate, aesthetic, formalism, among, other, alternatives, disputes, as, to, whether, or, not, to, classify, something, as, a, work, of, art, are, referred, to, as, classificatory, disputes, about, art, classificatory, disputes, in, the, 20th, century, have, included, cubist, and, impressionist, paintings, duchamp, s, fountain, the, movies, j, s, g, boggs, superlative, imitations, of, banknotes, conceptual, art, and, video, games, philosopher, david, novitz, has, argued, that, disagreement, about, the, definition, of, art, are, rarely, the, heart, of, the, problem, rather, the, passionate, concerns, and, interests, that, humans, vest, in, their, social, life, are, so, much, a, part, of, all, classificatory, disputes, about, art, according, to, novitz, classificatory, disputes, are, more, often, disputes, about, societal, values, and, where, society, is, trying, to, go, than, they, are, about, theory, proper, for, example, when, the, daily, mail, criticized, hirst, s, and, emin, s, work, by, arguing, for, 1, 000, years, art, has, been, one, of, our, great, civilising, forces, today, pickled, sheep, and, soiled, beds, threaten, to, make, barbarians, of, us, all, they, are, not, advancing, a, definition, or, theory, about, art, but, questioning, the, value, of, hirst, s, and, emin, s, work, in, 1998, arthur, danto, suggested, a, thought, experiment, showing, that, the, status, of, an, artifact, as, work, of, art, results, from, the, ideas, a, culture, applies, to, it, rather, than, its, inherent, physical, or, perceptible, qualities, cultural, interpretation, an, art, theory, of, some, kind, is, therefore, constitutive, of, an, object, s, arthood, anti, art, is, a, label, for, art, that, intentionally, challenges, the, established, parameters, and, values, of, art, it, is, a, term, associated, with, dadaism, and, attributed, to, marcel, duchamp, just, before, world, war, i, when, he, was, making, art, from, found, objects, one, of, these, fountain, 1917, an, ordinary, urinal, has, achieved, considerable, prominence, and, influence, on, art, anti, art, is, a, feature, of, work, by, situationist, international, the, lo, fi, mail, art, movement, and, the, young, british, artists, though, it, is, a, form, still, rejected, by, the, stuckists, who, describe, themselves, as, anti, anti, art, architecture, is, often, included, as, one, of, the, visual, arts, however, like, the, decorative, arts, or, advertising, it, involves, the, creation, of, objects, where, the, practical, considerations, of, use, are, essential, in, a, way, that, they, usually, are, not, in, a, painting, for, example, somewhat, in, relation, to, the, above, the, word, art, is, also, used, to, apply, judgments, of, value, as, in, such, expressions, as, that, meal, was, a, work, of, art, the, cook, is, an, artist, or, the, art, of, deception, the, highly, attained, level, of, skill, of, the, deceiver, is, praised, it, is, this, use, of, the, word, as, a, measure, of, high, quality, and, high, value, that, gives, the, term, its, flavor, of, subjectivity, making, judgments, of, value, requires, a, basis, for, criticism, at, the, simplest, level, a, way, to, determine, whether, the, impact, of, the, object, on, the, senses, meets, the, criteria, to, be, considered, art, is, whether, it, is, perceived, to, be, attractive, or, repulsive, though, perception, is, always, colored, by, experience, and, is, necessarily, subjective, it, is, commonly, understood, that, what, is, not, somehow, aesthetically, satisfying, cannot, be, art, however, good, art, is, not, always, or, even, regularly, aesthetically, appealing, to, a, majority, of, viewers, in, other, words, an, artist, s, prime, motivation, need, not, be, the, pursuit, of, the, aesthetic, also, art, often, depicts, terrible, images, made, for, social, moral, or, thought, provoking, reasons, for, example, francisco, goya, s, painting, depicting, the, spanish, shootings, of, 3, may, 1808, is, a, graphic, depiction, of, a, firing, squad, executing, several, pleading, civilians, yet, at, the, same, time, the, horrific, imagery, demonstrates, goya, s, keen, artistic, ability, in, composition, and, execution, and, produces, fitting, social, and, political, outrage, thus, the, debate, continues, as, to, what, mode, of, aesthetic, satisfaction, if, any, is, required, to, define, art, the, assumption, of, new, values, or, the, rebellion, against, accepted, notions, of, what, is, aesthetically, superior, need, not, occur, concurrently, with, a, complete, abandonment, of, the, pursuit, of, what, is, aesthetically, appealing, indeed, the, reverse, is, often, true, that, the, revision, of, what, is, popularly, conceived, of, as, being, aesthetically, appealing, allows, for, a, re, invigoration, of, aesthetic, sensibility, and, a, new, appreciation, for, the, standards, of, art, itself, countless, schools, have, proposed, their, own, ways, to, define, quality, yet, they, all, seem, to, agree, in, at, least, one, point, once, their, aesthetic, choices, are, accepted, the, value, of, the, work, of, art, is, determined, by, its, capacity, to, transcend, the, limits, of, its, chosen, medium, to, strike, some, universal, chord, by, the, rarity, of, the, skill, of, the, artist, or, in, its, accurate, reflection, in, what, is, termed, the, zeitgeist, art, is, often, intended, to, appeal, to, and, connect, with, human, emotion, it, can, arouse, aesthetic, or, moral, feelings, and, can, be, understood, as, a, way, of, communicating, these, feelings, artists, express, something, so, that, their, audience, is, aroused, to, some, extent, but, they, do, not, have, to, do, so, consciously, art, may, be, considered, an, exploration, of, the, human, condition, that, is, what, it, is, to, be, human, by, extension, it, has, been, argued, by, emily, l, spratt, that, the, development, of, generative, artificial, intelligence, especially, in, regard, to, artificial, intelligence, art, and, its, uses, with, images, necessitates, a, re, evaluation, of, aesthetic, theory, in, art, history, today, and, a, reconsideration, of, the, limits, of, human, creativity, music, and, artificial, intelligence, has, taken, a, similar, path, an, essential, legal, issue, are, art, forgeries, plagiarism, replicas, and, works, that, are, strongly, based, on, other, works,
