drawing, is, a, visual, art, that, uses, an, instrument, to, mark, paper, or, another, two, dimensional, surface, the, instruments, used, to, make, a, drawing, are, pencils, crayons, pens, with, inks, brushes, with, paints, or, combinations, of, these, and, in, more, modern, times, computer, styluses, with, graphics, tablets, or, gamepads, in, vr, drawing, software, a, drawing, instrument, releases, a, small, amount, of, material, onto, a, surface, leaving, a, visible, mark, the, most, common, support, for, drawing, is, paper, although, other, materials, such, as, cardboard, vellum, wood, plastic, leather, canvas, and, board, have, been, used, temporary, drawings, may, be, made, on, a, blackboard, or, whiteboard, drawing, has, been, a, popular, and, fundamental, means, of, public, expression, throughout, human, history, it, is, one, of, the, simplest, and, most, efficient, means, of, communicating, ideas, the, wide, availability, of, drawing, instruments, makes, drawing, one, of, the, most, common, artistic, activities, in, addition, to, its, more, artistic, forms, drawing, is, frequently, used, in, commercial, illustration, animation, architecture, engineering, and, technical, drawing, a, quick, freehand, drawing, usually, not, intended, as, a, finished, work, is, sometimes, called, a, sketch, an, artist, who, practices, or, works, in, technical, drawing, may, be, called, a, drafter, draftsman, or, draughtsman, drawing, is, one, of, the, oldest, forms, of, human, expression, within, the, visual, arts, it, is, generally, concerned, with, the, marking, of, lines, and, areas, of, tone, onto, paper, other, material, where, the, accurate, representation, of, the, visual, world, is, expressed, upon, a, plane, surface, traditional, drawings, were, monochrome, or, at, least, had, little, colour, while, modern, colored, pencil, drawings, may, approach, or, cross, a, boundary, between, drawing, and, painting, in, western, terminology, drawing, is, distinct, from, painting, even, though, similar, media, often, are, employed, in, both, tasks, dry, media, normally, associated, with, drawing, such, as, chalk, may, be, used, in, pastel, paintings, drawing, may, be, done, with, a, liquid, medium, applied, with, brushes, or, pens, using, a, brush, for, drawing, is, very, widespread, and, here, it, is, more, the, process, of, using, lines, and, hatching, that, characterises, something, as, a, drawing, similar, supports, likewise, can, serve, both, painting, generally, involves, the, application, of, liquid, paint, onto, prepared, canvas, or, panels, but, sometimes, an, underdrawing, is, drawn, first, on, that, same, support, drawing, is, often, exploratory, with, considerable, emphasis, on, observation, problem, solving, and, composition, drawing, is, also, regularly, used, in, preparation, for, a, painting, further, obfuscating, their, distinction, drawings, created, for, these, purposes, are, called, sketches, there, are, several, categories, of, drawing, including, figure, drawing, cartooning, doodling, and, freehand, there, are, also, many, drawing, methods, such, as, line, drawing, stippling, shading, the, surrealist, method, of, entopic, graphomania, in, which, dots, are, made, at, the, sites, of, impurities, in, a, blank, sheet, of, paper, and, lines, are, then, made, between, the, dots, and, tracing, drawing, on, a, translucent, paper, such, as, tracing, paper, around, the, outline, of, preexisting, shapes, that, show, through, the, paper, a, quick, unrefined, drawing, may, be, called, a, sketch, in, fields, outside, art, technical, drawings, or, plans, of, buildings, machinery, circuitry, and, other, things, are, often, called, drawings, even, when, they, have, been, transferred, to, another, medium, by, printing, drawing, is, one, of, the, oldest, forms, of, human, expression, with, evidence, for, its, existence, preceding, that, of, written, communication, it, is, believed, that, drawing, was, used, as, a, specialised, form, of, communication, before, the, invention, of, the, written, language, demonstrated, by, the, production, of, cave, and, rock, paintings, around, 30, 000, years, ago, art, of, the, upper, paleolithic, these, drawings, known, as, pictograms, depicted, objects, and, abstract, concepts, the, sketches, and, paintings, produced, by, neolithic, times, were, eventually, stylised, and, simplified, in, to, symbol, systems, proto, writing, and, eventually, into, early, writing, systems, before, the, widespread, availability, of, paper, in, europe, monks, in, european, monasteries, used, drawings, either, as, underdrawings, for, illuminated, manuscripts, on, vellum, or, parchment, or, as, the, final, image, drawing, has, also, been, used, extensively, in, the, field, of, science, as, a, method, of, discovery, understanding, and, explanation, drawing, diagrams, of, observations, is, an, important, part, of, scientific, study, in, 1609, astronomer, galileo, galilei, explained, the, changing, phases, of, venus, and, also, the, sunspots, through, his, observational, telescopic, drawings, in, 1924, geophysicist, alfred, wegener, used, illustrations, to, visually, demonstrate, the, origin, of, the, continents, drawing, is, one, of, the, easiest, ways, to, visualise, ideas, and, to, express, one, s, creativity, therefore, it, has, been, prominent, in, the, world, of, art, throughout, much, of, history, drawing, was, regarded, as, the, foundation, for, artistic, practice, initially, artists, used, and, reused, wooden, tablets, for, the, production, of, their, drawings, following, the, widespread, availability, of, paper, in, the, 14th, century, the, use, of, drawing, in, the, arts, increased, at, this, point, drawing, was, commonly, used, as, a, tool, for, thought, and, investigation, acting, as, a, study, medium, whilst, artists, were, preparing, for, their, final, pieces, of, work, the, renaissance, brought, about, a, great, sophistication, in, drawing, techniques, enabling, artists, to, represent, things, more, realistically, than, before, and, revealing, an, interest, in, geometry, and, philosophy, the, invention, of, the, first, widely, available, form, of, photography, led, to, a, shift, in, the, hierarchy, of, the, arts, photography, offered, an, alternative, to, drawing, as, a, method, for, accurately, representing, visual, phenomena, and, traditional, drawing, practice, was, given, less, emphasis, as, an, essential, skill, for, artists, particularly, so, in, western, society, drawing, became, significant, as, an, art, form, around, the, late, 15th, century, with, artists, and, master, engravers, such, as, albrecht, d, rer, and, martin, schongauer, c, 1448, 1491, the, first, northern, engraver, known, by, name, schongauer, came, from, alsace, and, was, born, into, a, family, of, goldsmiths, albrecht, d, rer, a, master, of, the, next, generation, was, also, the, son, of, a, goldsmith, old, master, drawings, often, reflect, the, history, of, the, country, in, which, they, were, produced, and, the, fundamental, characteristics, of, a, nation, at, that, time, in, 17th, century, holland, a, protestant, country, there, were, almost, no, religious, artworks, and, with, no, king, or, court, most, art, was, bought, privately, drawings, of, landscapes, or, genre, scenes, were, often, viewed, not, as, sketches, but, as, highly, finished, works, of, art, italian, drawings, however, show, the, influence, of, catholicism, and, the, church, which, played, a, major, role, in, artistic, patronage, the, same, is, often, true, of, french, drawings, although, in, the, 17th, century, the, disciplines, of, french, classicism, meant, drawings, were, less, baroque, than, the, more, free, italian, counterparts, which, conveyed, a, greater, sense, of, movement, in, the, 20th, century, modernism, encouraged, imaginative, originality, and, some, artists, approach, to, drawing, became, less, literal, more, abstract, world, renowned, artists, such, as, pablo, picasso, andy, warhol, and, jean, michel, basquiat, helped, challenge, the, status, quo, with, drawing, being, very, much, at, the, centre, of, their, practice, and, often, re, interpreting, traditional, technique, basquiat, s, drawings, were, produced, in, many, different, mediums, most, commonly, ink, pencil, felt, tip, or, marker, and, oil, stick, and, he, drew, on, any, surface, that, came, to, hand, such, as, doors, clothing, refrigerators, walls, and, baseball, helmets, the, centuries, have, produced, a, canon, of, notable, artists, and, draftsmen, each, with, their, own, distinct, language, of, drawing, including, the, medium, is, the, means, by, which, ink, pigment, or, color, are, delivered, onto, the, drawing, surface, most, drawing, media, either, are, dry, e, g, graphite, charcoal, pastels, cont, silverpoint, or, use, a, fluid, solvent, or, carrier, marker, pen, and, ink, watercolor, pencils, can, be, used, dry, like, ordinary, pencils, then, moistened, with, a, wet, brush, to, get, various, painterly, effects, very, rarely, artists, have, drawn, with, usually, decoded, invisible, ink, metalpoint, drawing, usually, employs, either, silver, or, lead, more, rarely, used, are, gold, platinum, copper, brass, bronze, and, tinpoint, paper, comes, in, a, variety, of, different, sizes, and, qualities, ranging, from, newspaper, grade, up, to, high, quality, and, relatively, expensive, paper, sold, as, individual, sheets, papers, vary, in, texture, hue, acidity, and, strength, when, wet, smooth, paper, is, good, for, rendering, fine, detail, but, a, more, toothy, paper, holds, the, drawing, material, better, thus, a, coarser, material, is, useful, for, producing, deeper, contrast, newsprint, and, typing, paper, may, be, useful, for, practice, and, rough, sketches, tracing, paper, is, used, to, experiment, over, a, half, finished, drawing, and, to, transfer, a, design, from, one, sheet, to, another, cartridge, paper, is, the, basic, type, of, drawing, paper, sold, in, pads, bristol, board, and, even, heavier, acid, free, boards, frequently, with, smooth, finishes, are, used, for, drawing, fine, detail, and, do, not, distort, when, wet, media, ink, washes, are, applied, vellum, is, extremely, smooth, and, suitable, for, very, fine, detail, coldpressed, watercolor, paper, may, be, favored, for, ink, drawing, due, to, its, texture, acid, free, archival, quality, paper, keeps, its, color, and, texture, far, longer, than, wood, pulp, based, paper, such, as, newsprint, which, turns, yellow, and, becomes, brittle, much, sooner, the, basic, tools, are, a, drawing, board, or, table, pencil, sharpener, and, eraser, and, for, ink, drawing, blotting, paper, other, tools, used, are, circle, compass, ruler, and, set, square, fixative, is, used, to, prevent, pencil, and, crayon, marks, from, smudging, drafting, tape, is, used, to, secure, paper, to, drawing, surface, and, also, to, mask, an, area, to, keep, it, free, of, accidental, marks, such, as, sprayed, or, spattered, materials, and, washes, an, easel, or, slanted, table, is, used, to, keep, the, drawing, surface, in, a, suitable, position, which, is, generally, more, horizontal, than, the, position, used, in, painting, almost, all, draftsmen, use, their, hands, and, fingers, to, apply, the, media, with, the, exception, of, some, handicapped, individuals, who, draw, with, their, mouth, or, feet, prior, to, working, on, an, image, the, artist, typically, explores, how, various, media, work, they, may, try, different, drawing, implements, on, practice, sheets, to, determine, value, and, texture, and, how, to, apply, the, implement, to, produce, various, effects, the, artist, s, choice, of, drawing, strokes, affects, the, appearance, of, the, image, pen, and, ink, drawings, often, use, hatching, groups, of, parallel, lines, cross, hatching, uses, hatching, in, two, or, more, different, directions, to, create, a, darker, tone, broken, hatching, or, lines, with, intermittent, breaks, form, lighter, tones, and, controlling, the, density, of, the, breaks, achieves, a, gradation, of, tone, stippling, uses, dots, to, produce, tone, texture, and, shade, different, textures, can, be, achieved, depending, on, the, method, used, to, build, tone, drawings, in, dry, media, often, use, similar, techniques, though, pencils, and, drawing, sticks, can, achieve, continuous, variations, in, tone, typically, a, drawing, is, filled, in, based, on, which, hand, the, artist, favors, a, right, handed, artist, draws, from, left, to, right, to, avoid, smearing, the, image, erasers, can, remove, unwanted, lines, lighten, tones, and, clean, up, stray, marks, in, a, sketch, or, outline, drawing, lines, drawn, often, follow, the, contour, of, the, subject, creating, depth, by, looking, like, shadows, cast, from, a, light, in, the, artist, s, position, sometimes, the, artist, leaves, a, section, of, the, image, untouched, while, filling, in, the, remainder, the, shape, of, the, area, to, preserve, can, be, painted, with, masking, fluid, or, cut, out, of, a, frisket, and, applied, to, the, drawing, surface, protecting, the, surface, from, stray, marks, until, the, mask, is, removed, another, method, to, preserve, a, section, of, the, image, is, to, apply, a, spray, on, fixative, to, the, surface, this, holds, loose, material, more, firmly, to, the, sheet, and, prevents, it, from, smearing, however, the, fixative, spray, typically, uses, chemicals, that, can, harm, the, respiratory, system, so, it, should, be, employed, in, a, well, ventilated, area, such, as, outdoors, another, technique, is, subtractive, drawing, in, which, the, drawing, surface, is, covered, with, graphite, or, charcoal, and, then, erased, to, make, the, image, shading, is, the, technique, of, varying, the, tonal, values, on, the, paper, to, represent, the, shade, of, the, material, as, well, as, the, placement, of, the, shadows, careful, attention, to, reflected, light, shadows, and, highlights, can, result, in, a, very, realistic, rendition, of, the, image, blending, uses, an, implement, to, soften, or, spread, the, original, drawing, strokes, blending, is, most, easily, done, with, a, medium, that, does, not, immediately, fix, itself, such, as, graphite, chalk, or, charcoal, although, freshly, applied, ink, can, be, smudged, wet, or, dry, for, some, effects, for, shading, and, blending, the, artist, can, use, a, blending, stump, tissue, a, kneaded, eraser, a, fingertip, or, any, combination, of, them, a, piece, of, chamois, is, useful, for, creating, smooth, textures, and, for, removing, material, to, lighten, the, tone, continuous, tone, can, be, achieved, with, graphite, on, a, smooth, surface, without, blending, but, the, technique, is, laborious, involving, small, circular, or, oval, strokes, with, a, somewhat, blunt, point, shading, techniques, that, also, introduce, texture, to, the, drawing, include, hatching, and, stippling, a, number, of, other, methods, produce, texture, in, addition, to, the, choice, of, paper, drawing, material, and, technique, affect, texture, texture, can, be, made, to, appear, more, realistic, when, it, is, drawn, next, to, a, contrasting, texture, a, coarse, texture, is, more, obvious, when, placed, next, to, a, smoothly, blended, area, a, similar, effect, can, be, achieved, by, drawing, different, tones, close, together, a, light, edge, next, to, a, dark, background, stands, out, to, the, eye, and, almost, appears, to, float, above, the, surface, measuring, the, dimensions, of, a, subject, while, blocking, in, the, drawing, is, an, important, step, in, producing, a, realistic, rendition, of, the, subject, tools, such, as, a, compass, can, be, used, to, measure, the, angles, of, different, sides, these, angles, can, be, reproduced, on, the, drawing, surface, and, then, rechecked, to, make, sure, they, are, accurate, another, form, of, measurement, is, to, compare, the, relative, sizes, of, different, parts, of, the, subject, with, each, other, a, finger, placed, at, a, point, along, the, drawing, implement, can, be, used, to, compare, that, dimension, with, other, parts, of, the, image, a, ruler, can, be, used, both, as, a, straightedge, and, a, device, to, compute, proportions, when, attempting, to, draw, a, complicated, shape, such, as, a, human, figure, it, is, helpful, at, first, to, represent, the, form, with, a, set, of, primitive, volumes, almost, any, form, can, be, represented, by, some, combination, of, the, cube, sphere, cylinder, and, cone, once, these, basic, volumes, have, been, assembled, into, a, likeness, then, the, drawing, can, be, refined, into, a, more, accurate, and, polished, form, the, lines, of, the, primitive, volumes, are, removed, and, replaced, by, the, final, likeness, drawing, the, underlying, construction, is, a, fundamental, skill, for, representational, art, and, is, taught, in, many, books, and, schools, its, correct, application, resolves, most, uncertainties, about, smaller, details, and, makes, the, final, image, look, consistent, a, more, refined, art, of, figure, drawing, relies, upon, the, artist, possessing, a, deep, understanding, of, anatomy, and, the, human, proportions, a, trained, artist, is, familiar, with, the, skeleton, structure, joint, location, muscle, placement, tendon, movement, and, how, the, different, parts, work, together, during, movement, this, allows, the, artist, to, render, more, natural, poses, that, do, not, appear, artificially, stiff, the, artist, is, also, familiar, with, how, the, proportions, vary, depending, on, the, age, of, the, subject, particularly, when, drawing, a, portrait, linear, perspective, is, a, method, of, portraying, objects, on, a, flat, surface, so, that, the, dimensions, shrink, with, distance, each, set, of, parallel, straight, edges, of, any, object, whether, a, building, or, a, table, follows, lines, that, eventually, converge, at, a, vanishing, point, typically, this, convergence, point, is, somewhere, along, the, horizon, as, buildings, are, built, level, with, the, flat, surface, when, multiple, structures, are, aligned, with, each, other, such, as, buildings, along, a, street, the, horizontal, tops, and, bottoms, of, the, structures, typically, converge, at, a, vanishing, point, when, both, the, fronts, and, sides, of, a, building, are, drawn, then, the, parallel, lines, forming, a, side, converge, at, a, second, point, along, the, horizon, which, may, be, off, the, drawing, paper, this, is, a, two, point, perspective, converging, the, vertical, lines, to, a, third, point, above, or, below, the, horizon, then, produces, a, three, point, perspective, depth, can, also, be, portrayed, by, several, techniques, in, addition, to, the, perspective, approach, above, objects, of, similar, size, should, appear, ever, smaller, the, further, they, are, from, the, viewer, thus, the, back, wheel, of, a, cart, appears, slightly, smaller, than, the, front, wheel, depth, can, be, portrayed, through, the, use, of, texture, as, the, texture, of, an, object, gets, further, away, it, becomes, more, compressed, and, busy, taking, on, an, entirely, different, character, than, if, it, was, close, depth, can, also, be, portrayed, by, reducing, the, contrast, in, more, distant, objects, and, by, making, their, colors, less, saturated, this, reproduces, the, effect, of, atmospheric, haze, and, cause, the, eye, to, focus, primarily, on, objects, drawn, in, the, foreground, the, composition, of, the, image, is, an, important, element, in, producing, an, interesting, work, of, artistic, merit, the, artist, plans, element, placement, in, the, art, to, communicate, ideas, and, feelings, with, the, viewer, the, composition, can, determine, the, focus, of, the, art, and, result, in, a, harmonious, whole, that, is, aesthetically, appealing, and, stimulating, the, illumination, of, the, subject, is, also, a, key, element, in, creating, an, artistic, piece, and, the, interplay, of, light, and, shadow, is, a, valuable, method, in, the, artist, s, toolbox, the, placement, of, the, light, sources, can, make, a, considerable, difference, in, the, type, of, message, that, is, being, presented, multiple, light, sources, can, wash, out, any, wrinkles, in, a, person, s, face, for, instance, and, give, a, more, youthful, appearance, in, contrast, a, single, light, source, such, as, harsh, daylight, can, serve, to, highlight, any, texture, or, interesting, features, when, drawing, an, object, or, figure, the, skilled, artist, pays, attention, to, both, the, area, within, the, silhouette, and, what, lies, outside, the, exterior, is, termed, the, negative, space, and, can, be, as, important, in, the, representation, as, the, figure, objects, placed, in, the, background, of, the, figure, should, appear, properly, placed, wherever, they, can, be, viewed, a, study, is, a, draft, drawing, that, is, made, in, preparation, for, a, planned, final, image, studies, can, be, used, to, determine, the, appearances, of, specific, parts, of, the, completed, image, or, for, experimenting, with, the, best, approach, for, accomplishing, the, end, goal, however, a, well, crafted, study, can, be, a, piece, of, art, in, its, own, right, and, many, hours, of, careful, work, can, go, into, completing, a, study, individuals, display, differences, in, their, ability, to, produce, visually, accurate, drawings, a, visually, accurate, drawing, is, described, as, being, recognized, as, a, particular, object, at, a, particular, time, and, in, a, particular, space, rendered, with, little, addition, of, visual, detail, that, can, not, be, seen, in, the, object, represented, or, with, little, deletion, of, visual, detail, investigative, studies, have, aimed, to, explain, the, reasons, why, some, individuals, draw, better, than, others, one, study, posited, four, key, abilities, in, the, drawing, process, motor, skills, required, for, mark, making, the, drawer, s, own, perception, of, their, drawing, perception, of, objects, being, drawn, and, the, ability, to, make, good, representational, decisions, following, this, hypothesis, several, studies, have, sought, to, conclude, which, of, these, processes, are, most, significant, in, affecting, the, accuracy, of, drawings, motor, control, is, an, important, physical, component, in, the, production, phase, of, the, drawing, process, it, has, been, suggested, that, motor, control, plays, a, role, in, drawing, ability, though, its, effects, are, not, significant, it, has, been, suggested, that, an, individual, s, ability, to, perceive, an, object, they, are, drawing, is, the, most, important, stage, in, the, drawing, process, this, suggestion, is, supported, by, the, discovery, of, a, robust, relationship, between, perception, and, drawing, ability, this, evidence, acted, as, the, basis, of, betty, edwards, how, to, draw, book, drawing, on, the, right, side, of, the, brain, edwards, aimed, to, teach, her, readers, how, to, draw, based, on, the, development, of, the, reader, s, perceptual, abilities, furthermore, the, influential, artist, and, art, critic, john, ruskin, emphasised, the, importance, of, perception, in, the, drawing, process, in, his, book, the, elements, of, drawing, he, stated, that, for, i, am, nearly, convinced, that, once, we, see, keenly, enough, there, is, very, little, difficult, in, drawing, what, we, see, this, has, also, been, shown, to, influence, one, s, ability, to, create, visually, accurate, drawings, short, term, memory, plays, an, important, part, in, drawing, as, one, s, gaze, shifts, between, the, object, they, are, drawing, and, the, drawing, itself, some, studies, comparing, artists, to, non, artists, have, found, that, artists, spend, more, time, thinking, strategically, while, drawing, in, particular, artists, spend, more, time, on, metacognitive, activities, such, as, considering, different, hypothetical, plans, for, how, they, might, progress, with, a, drawing, notes, further, reading
