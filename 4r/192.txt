her, mother, s, knowledge, during, the, temporary, absence, of, the, two, men, she, meets, cecily, they, get, along, well, at, first, but, when, they, learn, of, the, other, s, engagement, each, indignantly, declares, that, she, is, the, one, engaged, to, ernest, when, jack, and, algernon, reappear, together, gwendolen, and, cecily, realise, they, have, been, deceived, they, leave, the, men, in, the, garden, and, withdraw, to, the, house, morning, room, at, the, manor, house, woolton, gwendolen, and, cecily, forgive, the, men, s, trickery, arriving, in, pursuit, of, her, daughter, lady,

do, the, impasse, is, resolved, by, the, return, of, miss, prism, whom, lady, bracknell, recognises, as, the, person, who, 28, years, earlier, as, a, family, nursemaid, had, taken, a, baby, boy, out, in, a, perambulator, from, lord, bracknell, s, house, and, never, returned, challenged, miss, prism, explains, that, she, had, absent, mindedly, put, into, the, perambulator, the, manuscript, of, a, novel, she, was, writing, and, put, the, baby, in, a, handbag, which, she, later, left, at, victoria, station, jack, produces, the, same, handbag, showing, that, he, is, the, lost, baby, the, eldest, son, of, lady, bracknell, s, late, sister, and, thus, algernon, s, elder, brother, having, acquired, such, respectable, relations, he, is, acceptable, as, gwendolen, s, suitor, gwendolen, continues, to, insist, that, she, can, love, only, a, man, named, ernest, lady, bracknell, tells, jack, that, as, the, firstborn, he, would, have, been, named, after, his, father, general, moncrieff, jack, examines, the, army, lists, and, discovers, that, his, father, s, name, and, hence, his, own, original, christening, name, was, in, fact, ernest, as, the, happy, couples, embrace, ernest, and, gwendolen, algernon, and, cecily, and, even, dr, chasuble, and, miss, prism, lady, bracknell, complains, to, her, newfound, relative, my, nephew, you, seem, to, be, displaying, signs, of, triviality, he, replies, on, the, contrary, aunt, augusta, i, ve, now, realized, for, the, first, time, in, my, life, the, vital, importance, of, being, earnest, the, importance, of, being, earnest, followed, the, success, of, wilde, s, earlier, drawing, room, plays, lady, windermere, s, fan, 1892, a, woman, of, no, importance, 1893, and, an, ideal, husband, 1895, he, spent, the, summer, of, 1894, with, his, family, at, worthing, on, the, sussex, coast, where, he, began, work, on, the, new, play, wilde, scholars, generally, agree, that, the, most, important, influence, on, the, play, was, w, s, gilbert, s, 1877, farce, engaged, from, which, wilde, borrowed, not, only, several, incidents, but, also, in, the, words, of, russell, jackson, in, his, 1980, introduction, to, wilde, s, play, the, gravity, of, tone, demanded, by, gilbert, of, his, actors, wilde, s, first, draft, was, so, long, that, it, filled, four, exercise, books, and, over, the, summer, he, continually, revised, and, refined, it, as, he, had, done, with, his, earlier, plays, among, his, many, changes, he, altered, the, subtitle, from, a, serious, comedy, for, trivial, people, to, a, trivial, comedy, for, serious, people, and, renamed, the, characters, lady, brancaster, and, algernon, montford, as, lady, bracknell, and, algernon, moncrieff, wilde, wrote, the, part, of, john, worthing, with, the, actor, manager, charles, wyndham, in, mind, wilde, shared, bernard, shaw, s, view, that, wyndham, was, the, ideal, comedy, actor, and, based, the, character, on, his, stage, persona, wyndham, accepted, the, play, for, production, at, his, theatre, but, before, rehearsals, began, he, changed, his, plans, in, order, to, help, a, beleaguered, colleague, the, actor, manager, george, alexander, of, the, st, james, s, theatre, in, early, 1895, alexander, s, production, of, henry, james, s, guy, domville, failed, and, closed, after, 31, performances, leaving, alexander, in, urgent, need, of, a, new, play, to, follow, it, wyndham, waived, his, contractual, rights, and, allowed, alexander, to, stage, wilde, s, play, after, working, with, wilde, on, stage, movements, using, a, model, theatre, alexander, asked, the, author, to, shorten, the, play, from, four, acts, to, three, wilde, complied, and, combined, elements, of, the, second, and, third, acts, the, largest, cut, was, the, removal, of, the, character, of, mr, gribsby, a, solicitor, who, comes, from, london, to, serve, a, writ, on, the, profligate, ernest, worthing, for, unpaid, dining, bills, at, the, savoy, hotel, wilde, was, not, entirely, happy, with, alterations, made, at, alexander, s, behest, he, said, yes, it, is, quite, a, good, play, i, remember, i, wrote, one, very, like, it, myself, but, it, was, even, more, brilliant, than, this, but, the, three, act, version, usually, performed, is, widely, considered, more, effective, than, wilde, s, four, act, original, the, play, was, first, produced, at, the, st, james, s, theatre, london, on, 14, february, valentine, s, day, 1895, preceded, by, a, curtain, raiser, a, short, comedy, called, in, the, season, by, langdon, e, mitchell, during, most, of, the, month, long, rehearsal, period, wilde, was, on, holiday, in, algeria, with, his, gay, partner, lord, alfred, douglas, but, he, returned, in, time, for, the, dress, rehearsal, on, 12, february, douglas, remained, in, algiers, his, father, the, marquess, of, queensberry, planned, to, disrupt, the, premiere, by, throwing, a, bouquet, of, rotten, vegetables, at, the, playwright, when, he, took, his, bow, at, the, end, wilde, learned, of, the, plan, and, alexander, cancelled, queensberry, s, ticket, and, arranged, for, the, police, to, bar, his, entrance, wilde, wrote, to, douglas, he, arrived, with, a, prize, fighter, i, had, all, scotland, yard, to, guard, the, theatre, he, prowled, around, for, three, hours, then, left, chattering, like, a, monstrous, ape, queensberry, left, the, bouquet, at, the, theatre, entrance, wilde, arrived, for, the, premiere, dressed, in, florid, sobriety, wearing, a, green, carnation, in, his, lapel, allan, aynesworth, who, played, algernon, moncrieff, recalled, to, hesketh, pearson, the, theatrical, newspaper, the, era, reported, that, the, play, met, with, enthusiastic, and, unanimous, approval, and, confidently, predicted, a, long, and, prosperous, run, aynesworth, was, debonair, and, stylish, and, alexander, who, played, jack, worthing, demure, according, to, the, era, mr, george, alexander, played, worthing, just, as, a, part, of, this, sort, should, be, played, i, e, with, entire, seriousness, and, no, indication, of, purposed, irony, the, morning, post, said, that, irene, vanbrugh, and, evelyn, millard, could, not, be, bettered, and, caught, the, required, gilbertian, tone, the, observer, remarked, on, the, rapturous, amusement, of, the, audience, and, echoed, the, era, s, prediction, of, a, long, run, according, to, the, published, text, the, characters, descriptions, and, cast, comprised, queensberry, continued, harassing, wilde, who, within, weeks, launched, a, private, prosecution, against, him, for, criminal, libel, triggering, a, series, of, trials, that, revealed, wilde, s, homosexual, private, life, and, ended, in, his, imprisonment, for, gross, indecency, in, may, 1895, the, victorian, public, turned, against, him, after, his, arrest, and, box, office, receipts, dwindled, rapidly, alexander, tried, to, save, the, production, by, removing, the, author, s, name, from, the, playbills, but, it, closed, on, 8, may, after, only, 83, performances, the, play, s, original, broadway, production, opened, at, the, empire, theatre, on, 22, april, 1895, but, closed, after, sixteen, performances, its, cast, included, william, faversham, as, algernon, henry, miller, as, jack, viola, allen, as, gwendolen, and, ida, vernon, as, lady, bracknell, the, australian, premiere, was, in, melbourne, on, 10, august, 1895, presented, by, robert, brough, and, dion, boucicault, jr, with, cecil, ward, as, jack, boucicault, as, algernon, and, jenny, watt, tanner, as, lady, bracknell, the, production, was, an, immediate, success, wilde, s, downfall, in, england, did, not, affect, the, popularity, of, his, plays, in, australia, the, same, company, presented, the, new, zealand, premiere, in, october, 1895, when, the, play, was, enthusiastically, received, reviewers, said, in, subtlety, of, thought, brilliancy, of, wit, and, sparkling, humour, it, has, scarcely, been, excelled, and, its, fun, is, irresistible, increasing, in, intensity, until, in, the, third, and, last, act, it, becomes, uproarious, in, contrast, with, much, theatre, of, the, time, the, light, plot, of, the, importance, of, being, earnest, does, not, address, serious, social, and, political, issues, and, this, troubled, some, contemporary, reviewers, though, unsure, of, wilde, s, seriousness, as, a, dramatist, they, recognised, the, play, s, cleverness, humour, and, popularity, shaw, found, the, play, extremely, funny, but, heartless, a, view, he, maintained, all, his, life, his, review, in, the, saturday, review, argued, that, comedy, should, touch, as, well, as, amuse, i, go, to, the, theatre, to, be, moved, to, laughter, not, to, be, tickled, or, bustled, into, it, in, the, world, william, archer, wrote, that, he, had, enjoyed, watching, the, play, but, found, it, to, be, empty, of, meaning, what, can, a, poor, critic, do, with, a, play, which, raises, no, principle, whether, of, art, or, morals, creates, its, own, canons, and, conventions, and, is, nothing, but, an, absolutely, wilful, expression, of, an, irrepressibly, witty, personality, in, the, speaker, a, b, walkley, admired, the, play, and, was, one, of, few, to, see, it, as, the, culmination, of, wilde, s, dramatic, career, he, denied, that, the, term, farce, was, derogatory, or, even, lacking, in, seriousness, and, said, it, is, of, nonsense, all, compact, and, better, nonsense, i, think, our, stage, has, not, seen, h, g, wells, in, an, unsigned, review, for, the, pall, mall, gazette, called, the, play, one, of, the, freshest, comedies, of, the, year, saying, more, humorous, dealing, with, theatrical, conventions, it, would, be, difficult, to, imagine, he, also, questioned, whether, people, would, fully, see, its, message, how, serious, people, will, take, this, trivial, comedy, intended, for, their, learning, remains, to, be, seen, no, doubt, seriously, the, play, was, so, light, hearted, that, some, reviewers, compared, it, to, comic, opera, rather, than, drama, w, h, auden, later, 1963, called, it, a, pure, verbal, opera, and, the, times, commented, the, story, is, almost, too, preposterous, to, go, without, music, mary, mccarthy, in, sights, and, spectacles, 1959, despite, thinking, the, play, extremely, funny, called, it, a, ferocious, idyll, depravity, is, the, hero, and, the, only, character, as, wilde, s, works, came, to, be, read, and, performed, again, in, the, early, 20th, century, it, was, the, importance, of, being, earnest, that, received, the, most, productions, the, critic, and, author, max, beerbohm, called, the, play, wilde, s, finest, most, undeniably, his, own, saying, that, the, plots, of, his, other, comedies, lady, windermere, s, fan, a, woman, of, no, importance, and, an, ideal, husband, follow, the, manner, of, victorien, sardou, and, are, similarly, unrelated, to, the, theme, of, the, work, while, in, the, importance, of, being, earnest, the, story, is, dissolved, into, the, form, of, the, play, by, the, time, of, its, centenary, in, 1995, the, journalist, mark, lawson, described, the, piece, as, the, second, most, known, and, quoted, play, in, english, after, hamlet, the, importance, of, being, earnest, and, wilde, s, three, other, drawing, room, plays, were, performed, in, britain, during, the, author, s, imprisonment, and, exile, by, small, touring, groups, a, b, tapping, s, company, toured, the, importance, between, october, 1895, and, march, 1896, and, elsie, lanham, s, touring, company, presented, it, along, with, lady, windermere, s, fan, beginning, in, november, 1899, the, play, was, well, received, one, local, critic, described, it, as, sparkling, with, wit, and, epigrams, and, another, called, it, a, most, entertaining, comedy, some, sparkling, dialogue, the, play, was, not, seen, again, in, london, until, after, wilde, s, death, in, 1900, alexander, revived, it, in, the, small, coronet, theatre, in, notting, hill, outside, the, west, end, in, december, the, following, year, after, taking, it, on, tour, starring, as, john, worthing, with, a, cast, that, included, the, young, lilian, braithwaite, as, cecily, the, manchester, guardian, called, the, piece, a, brilliant, play, the, importance, of, being, earnest, returned, to, the, west, end, when, alexander, presented, a, revival, at, the, st, james, s, in, 1902, it, was, billed, as, by, the, author, of, lady, windermere, s, fan, and, few, reviews, mentioned, wilde, s, name, but, his, work, was, praised, the, sporting, times, said, the, revival, ran, for, 52, performances, for, the, first, broadway, revival, by, charles, frohman, s, empire, stock, company, later, in, 1902, the, playbills, and, the, reviews, restored, the, author, s, name, alexander, presented, the, work, again, at, the, st, james, s, in, 1909, when, he, and, aynesworth, reprised, their, original, roles, that, revival, ran, for, 316, performances, max, beerbohm, said, that, the, play, was, sure, to, become, a, classic, of, the, english, repertory, and, that, its, humour, was, as, fresh, then, as, when, it, had, been, written, adding, that, the, actors, had, worn, as, well, as, the, play, the, play, was, revived, on, broadway, in, 1910, with, a, cast, that, included, hamilton, revelle, a, e, matthews, and, jane, oaker, the, new, york, times, commented, that, the, play, has, lost, nothing, of, its, humor, no, one, with, a, sense, of, humor, can, afford, to, miss, it, for, a, 1913, revival, at, the, st, james, s, the, young, actors, gerald, ames, and,

for, 1890s, costumes, was, established, as, a, critic, in, the, manchester, guardian, put, it, thirty, years, on, one, begins, to, feel, that, wilde, should, be, done, in, the, costume, of, his, period, that, his, wit, today, needs, the, backing, of, the, atmosphere, that, gave, it, life, and, truth, wilde, s, glittering, and, complex, verbal, felicities, go, ill, with, the, shingle, and,

and, serious, poses, a, special, problem, for, translators, the, simplest, instance, of, a, suitable, translation, of, the, pun, is, in, german, where, ernst, serious, and, ernst, given, name, are, the, same, as, wordplay, is, usually, unique, to, the, language, in, question, translators, are, faced, with, a, choice, of, either, staying, faithful, to, the, original, or, creating, a, similar,

basing, the, story, entirely, on, the, earnest, ernest, verbal, conceit, freed, from, living, up, to, any, drama, more, serious, than, conversation, wilde, could, now, amuse, himself, to, a, fuller, extent, with, quips, bons, mots, epigrams, and, repartee, that, had, really, nothing, to, do, with, the, business, at, hand, the, academic, sos, eltis, comments, that, although, wilde, s, earliest, and, longest, handwritten, drafts, of, the, play, are, full, of, farcical, accidents, broad, puns, and, a, number, of, familiar, comic, devices, in, his, revisions, wilde, transformed, standard, nonsense, into, the, more, systematic, and, disconcerting, illogicality, which, characterizes, earnest, s, dialogue, the, genre, of, the, importance, of, being, earnest, has, been, debated, by, scholars, and, critics, who, have, variously, categorised, it, as, high, comedy, farce, parody, and, satire, in, a, 1956, critique, richard, foster, argues, that, the, play, creates, an, as, if,

which, we, recognise, the, beautiful, it, is, precisely, because, it, is, consistently, trivial, that, it, is, not, ugly, salome, an, ideal, husband, and, the, picture, of, dorian, gray, had, dwelt,

ross, that, the, play, s, theme, was, that, we, should, treat, all, trivial, things, in, life, very, seriously, and, all, serious, things, of, life, with, a, sincere, and, studied, triviality, the, theme, is, glanced, at, in, the, play, s, title, and, earnestness, is, repeatedly, alluded, to, in, the, dialogue, algernon, says, in, act, ii, one, must, be, serious, about, something, if, one, is, to, have, any, amusement, in, life, but, goes, on, to, reproach, jack, for, being, serious, about, everything, and, thus, revealing, a, trivial, nature, blackmail, and, corruption, had, haunted, the,

and, ernest, is, for, more, innocent, purposes, largely, to, evade, unwelcome, social, obligations, while, much, theatre, of, the, time, tackled, serious, social, and, political, issues, wilde, s, writing, in, this, play, is, the, antithesis, of, that, of, didactic, writers, like, shaw, who, used, their, characters, to, present, audiences, with, grand, ideals, and, appeals, for, social, justice, the, play, repeatedly, mocks, victorian, traditions, and, social, customs, marriage, and, the, pursuit, of, love, in, particular, in, victorian, times, earnestness, was, considered, by, some, to, be, the, overriding, societal, value, originating, in, religious, attempts, to, reform, the, lower, classes, it, spread, to, the, middle, and, upper, classes, during, the, mid, 19th, century, the,

serious, about, meals, it, is, so, shallow, of, them, wilde, s, inversion, of, values, continues, when, algernon, arrives, in, woolton, masquerading, as, ernest, he, tells, cecily, that, he, is, not, really, wicked, at, all, in, the, final, scene, jack, asks, gwendolen, if, she, can, forgive, him, for, not, having, been, deceitful, after, all, in, turn, gwendolen, and, cecily, have, the, idea, of,

exaggeratedly, incongruous, situations, such, as, jack, s, arrival, in, full, mourning, for, the, brother, who, has, just, walked, into, his, house, and, the, sudden, switch, from, fulsome, affection, between, cecily, and, gwendolen, to, deep, hostility, on, discovering, that, they, are, supposedly, both, engaged, to, the, same, man, in, queer, theory, the, play, s, themes, of, duplicity, and, ambivalence, are, inextricably, bound, up, with, wilde, s, homosexuality, so, that, the, play, exhibits, what, one, critic, terms, a, flickering, presence, absence, of, homosexual, desire, after, his, release, from, prison, wilde, wrote, to, reginald, turner, it, was, extraordinary, reading, the, play, over, how, i, used, to, toy, with, that, tiger, life, in, a, 2014, study, william, eaton, writes, the, importance, of, being, earnest, is, what, it, obviously, is, a, play, about, dissimulation, and, that, dissimulation, not, seeming, to, be, who, one, was, was, extremely, important, for, homosexuals, of, wilde, s, time, and, place, and, thus, was, an, extremely, non, trivial, matter, for, wilde, in, the, wildean, 2014, clifton, snider, writes, that, the, play, s, homosexual, subtext, is, not, immediately, apparent, but, that, the, dialogue, surely, hint, at, homosexual, acts, particularly, in, lady, bracknell, s, comment, that, a, railway, station, cloakroom, might, serve, to, conceal, a, social, indiscretion, deconstructionist, approaches, to, the, play, have, interpreted, the, prominence, of, linguistic, destabilisation, particularly, punning, as, reflecting, the, destabilisation, of, the, social, world, in, which, heterosexuality, is, assumed, default, and, dominant, eve, kosofsky, sedgwick, a, proponent, of, queer, theory, contends, that, the, play, continually, undercuts, the, idea, that, there, is, a, natural, correspondence, between, what, things, or, people, are, called, and, what, they, are, with, particular, reference, to, the, importance, of, fathers, and, fathers, names, she, concurs, with, christopher, craft, that, wilde, s, persistent, subversion, of, the, normal, meaning, of, words, undermines, the, norms, of, society, including, the, assumption, that, all, men, should, be, heterosexual, and, conventionally, masculine, and, that, there, is, a, natural, path, for, a, man, s, story, that, ends, in, heterosexual, family, life, certain, linguistic, aspects, of, the, play, have, been, interpreted, as, allusions, to, gay, culture, and, stereotypes, such, as, references, to, the, german, language, and, the, composer, richard, wagner, both, associated, with, male, homosexuality, in, wilde, s, day, aunt, and, uncle, both, prominent, relations, within, the, play, were, used, as, slang, terms, for, roles, in, gay, relationships, in, 1990, noel, annan, suggested, that, the, use, of, the, name, ernest, may, have, been, a, homosexual, in, joke, in, 1892, two, years, before, wilde, began, writing, the, play, john, gambril, nicholson, had, published, a, book, of, pederastic, poetry, love, in, earnest, the, sonnet, of, boys, names, included, the, verse, though, frank, may, ring, like, silver, bell, and, cecil, softer, music, claim, they, cannot, work, the, miracle, tis, ernest, sets, my, heart, a, flame, annan, speculated, that, earnest, may, also, have, been, a, private, code, word, among, gay, men, as, in, is, he, earnest, in, the, same, way, that, is, he, musical, is, thought, to, have, been, used, eaton, finds, this, theory, unconvincing, and, in, 2001, sir, donald, sinden, an, actor, who, had, met, lord, alfred, douglas, and, two, of, the, play, s, original, cast, irene, vanbrugh, and, allan, aynesworth, wrote, to, the, times, to, rebut, suggestions, that, earnest, held, any, sexual, connotations, bunbury, is, a, village, in, cheshire, several, theories, have, been, advanced, to, explain, wilde, s, use, of, the, name, to, imply, a, secretive, double, life, it, may, have, derived, from, henry, shirley, bunbury, a, hypochondriacal, acquaintance, of, wilde, s, youth, another, theory, is, that, wilde, spotted, the, names, of, a, captain, bunbury, and, a, magistrate, mr, bunbury, in, the, worthing, gazette, in, august, and, september, 1894, found, the, surname, pleasing, and, borrowed, it, a, suggestion, put, forward, by, aleister, crowley, who, knew, wilde, was, that, bunbury, was, a, portmanteau, word, coined, after, wilde, had, taken, a, train, to, banbury, met, a, boy, there, and, arranged, a, second, meeting, at, sunbury, joel, fineman, in, 1980, wrote, that, bunbury, was, british, slang, for, a, male, brothel, and, an, allusion, to, the, euphemism, bury, in, the, bun, meaning, anal, sex, between, men, carolyn, williams, in, a, 2010, study, writes, that,

had, for, several, years, been, famous, for, dialogue, and, his, use, of, language, raby, has, argued, that, in, this, play, the, author, achieved, unity, and, mastery, unmatched, in, his, other, plays, with, the, possible, exception, of, salome, raby, comments, that, although, the, earlier, comedies, suffer, from, an, unevenness, resulting, from, the, thematic, clash, between, the, trivial, and, the, serious, the, importance, of, being, earnest, achieves, a, pitch, perfect, style, that, allows, these, clashes, to, dissolve, raby, identifies, three, different, registers, in, the, play, algernon, s, exchange, with, his, manservant, conveying, an, underlying, unity, despite, their, differing, attitudes, the, imperious, pronouncements, of, lady, bracknell, are, as, startling, for, her,

overbearing, matriarch, the, woman, with, a, past, the, puritanical, young, lady, his, treatment, is, subtler, than, in, his, earlier, comedies, lady, bracknell, for, instance, embodies, respectable, upper, class, society, but, eltis, notes, how, her, development, from, the, familiar, overbearing, duchess, into, a, quirkier, and, more, disturbing, character, can, be, traced, through, wilde, s, revisions, of, the, play, for, the, two, young, men, wilde, presents, not, stereotypical, stage, dudes, but, intelligent, beings, who, as, russell, jackson, puts, it, speak, like, their, creator, in, well, formed, complete, sentences, and, rarely, use, slang, or, vogue, words, dr, chasuble, and, miss, prism, are, in, jackson, s, view, characterised, by, a, few, light, touches, of, detail, their,
