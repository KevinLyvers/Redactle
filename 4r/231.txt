the, book, of, healing, arabic, romanized, kit, b, al, shif, latin, sufficientia, also, known, as, the, cure, or, assepha, is, a, scientific, and, philosophical, encyclopedia, written, by, abu, ali, ibn, s, na, also, known, as, avicenna, from, medieval, persia, near, bukhara, in, maverounnahr, he, most, likely, began, to, compose, the, book, in, 1014, completed, it, around, 1020, and, published, it, in, 1027, this, work, is, ibn, sina, s, major, work, on, science, and, philosophy, and, is, intended, to, cure, or, heal, ignorance, of, the, soul, thus, despite, its, title, it, is, not, concerned, with, medicine, in, contrast, to, avicenna, s, earlier, the, canon, of, medicine, 5, vols, which, is, in, fact, medical, the, book, is, divided, into, four, parts, logic, natural, sciences, mathematics, a, quadrivium, of, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and, metaphysics, it, was, influenced, by, ancient, greek, philosophers, such, as, aristotle, hellenistic, thinkers, such, as, ptolemy, and, earlier, persian, muslim, scientists, and, philosophers, such, as, al, kindi, alkindus, al, farabi, alfarabi, and, al, b, r, n, in, astronomy, the, book, proposes, the, theory, that, venus, is, closer, to, earth, than, the, sun, ibn, sina, s, theory, on, the, formation, of, metals, combined, the, alchemical, sulfur, mercury, theory, of, metals, although, he, was, a, critic, of, alchemy, with, the, mineralogical, theories, of, aristotle, and, theophrastus, he, created, a, synthesis, of, ideas, concerning, the, nature, of, the, mineral, and, metallic, states, toulmin, and, goodfield, 1965, commented, on, avicenna, s, contribution, to, geology, around, a, d, 1000, avicenna, was, already, suggesting, a, hypothesis, about, the, origin, of, mountain, ranges, which, in, the, christian, world, would, still, have, been, considered, quite, radical, eight, hundred, years, later, ibn, sina, also, contributed, to, paleontology, with, his, explanation, of, how, the, stoniness, of, fossils, was, caused, aristotle, previously, explained, it, in, terms, of, vaporous, exhalations, which, ibn, sina, modified, into, the, theory, of, petrifying, fluids, succus, lapidificatus, which, was, elaborated, on, by, albertus, magnus, in, the, 13th, century, and, accepted, in, some, form, by, most, naturalists, by, the, 16th, century, ibn, sina, made, the, following, observation, on, the, theories, held, at, the, time, on, fossils, and, the, petrifaction, of, plants, and, animals, if, what, is, said, concerning, the, petrifaction, of, animals, and, plants, is, true, the, cause, of, this, phenomenon, is, a, powerful, mineralizing, and, petrifying, virtue, which, arises, in, certain, stony, spots, or, emanates, suddenly, from, the, earth, during, earthquake, and, subsidences, and, petrifies, whatever, comes, into, contact, with, it, as, a, matter, of, fact, the, petrifaction, of, the, bodies, of, plants, and, animals, is, not, more, extraordinary, than, the, transformation, of, waters, in, the, book, of, healing, avicenna, discusses, the, mind, its, existence, the, mind, body, relationship, sensation, perception, etc, he, writes, that, at, the, most, common, level, the, influence, of, the, mind, on, the, body, can, be, seen, in, voluntary, movements, in, that, the, body, obeys, whenever, the, mind, wishes, to, move, the, body, he, further, writes, that, the, second, level, of, influence, of, the, mind, on, the, body, is, from, emotions, and, the, will, as, an, example, he, states, that, if, a, plank, of, wood, is, placed, as, a, bridge, over, a, chasm, a, person, could, hardly, creep, over, it, without, falling, if, that, person, only, pictures, themself, in, a, possible, fall, so, vividly, that, the, natural, power, of, limbs, accord, with, it, he, also, writes, that, strong, negative, emotions, can, have, a, negative, effect, on, the, vegetative, functions, of, an, individual, and, may, even, lead, to, death, in, some, cases, he, also, discusses, hypnosis, al, wahm, al, amil, stating, that, one, could, create, conditions, in, another, person, so, that, they, accepts, the, reality, of, hypnosis, avicenna, was, also, the, first, to, divide, human, perception, into, the, five, external, senses, the, classical, senses, of, hearing, sight, smell, taste, and, touch, known, since, ancient, history, and, the, five, internal, senses, which, he, discovered, himself, 366, avicenna, also, gives, psychological, explanations, for, certain, somatic, illnesses, alwayings, linking, the, physical, and, psychological, illnesses, together, he, describes, melancholia, i, e, depression, as, a, type, of, mood, disorder, in, which, the, person, may, become, suspicious, and, develop, certain, types, of, phobias, he, states, that, anger, heralds, the, transition, of, melancholia, to, mania, and, explains, that, humidity, inside, the, head, can, contribute, to, mood, disorders, he, recognizes, that, this, occurs, when, the, amount, of, breath, changes, happiness, increases, the, breath, which, leads, to, increased, moisture, inside, the, brain, but, if, this, moisture, goes, beyond, its, limits, the, brain, would, lose, control, over, its, rationality, and, lead, to, mental, disorders, he, also, writes, about, symptoms, and, treatments, for, nightmare, epilepsy, and, weak, memory, 366, avicenna, often, used, psychological, methods, to, treat, his, patients, 366, one, such, example, is, when, a, persian, prince, had, melancholia, suffering, from, the, delusion, that, he, was, a, cow, he, would, moo, and, cry, out, kill, me, so, that, a, good, stew, may, be, made, of, my, flesh, and, would, never, eat, anything, avicenna, was, persuaded, to, take, the, case, avicenna, sent, a, message, to, the, patient, asking, him, to, be, happy, as, the, butcher, was, coming, to, slaughter, him, and, the, sick, man, rejoiced, when, avicenna, approached, the, prince, with, a, knife, in, his, hand, he, asked, where, is, the, cow, so, i, may, kill, it, the, patient, then, mooed, like, a, cow, to, indicate, where, he, was, the, patient, was, laid, on, the, ground, for, slaughter, when, avicenna, approached, the, patient, pretending, to, be, ready, to, slaughter, him, he, said, the, cow, is, too, lean, and, not, ready, to, be, killed, he, must, be, fed, properly, and, i, will, kill, it, when, it, becomes, healthy, and, fat, the, patient, was, then, offered, food, which, he, ate, eagerly, and, gradually, gained, strength, got, rid, of, his, delusion, and, was, completely, cured, 376, in, the, medieval, islamic, world, due, to, avicenna, s, successful, reconciliation, of, aristotelianism, and, neoplatonism, along, with, kalam, avicennism, eventually, became, the, leading, school, of, early, islamic, philosophy, by, the, 12th, century, with, avicenna, becoming, a, central, authority, on, philosophy, avicennism, was, also, influential, in, medieval, europe, particular, his, doctrines, on, the, nature, of, the, soul, and, his, existence, essence, distinction, along, with, the, debates, and, censure, that, they, raised, in, scholastic, europe, this, was, particularly, the, case, in, paris, where, avicennism, was, later, proscribed, in, 1210, nevertheless, his, muslim, psychology, and, theory, of, knowledge, influenced, william, of, auvergne, and, albertus, magnus, while, his, metaphysics, influenced, the, thought, of, thomas, aquinas, avicenna, discussed, the, topic, of, logic, in, islamic, philosophy, extensively, in, his, works, and, developed, his, own, system, of, logic, known, as, avicennian, logic, as, an, alternative, to, aristotelian, logic, by, the, 12th, century, avicennian, logic, had, replaced, aristotelian, logic, as, the, dominant, system, of, logic, in, the, islamic, world, after, the, latin, translations, of, the, 12th, century, his, writings, on, logic, were, also, an, important, influence, on, western, medieval, writers, such, as, albertus, magnus, he, wrote, on, the, hypothetical, syllogism, and, on, the, propositional, calculus, which, were, both, part, of, the, stoic, logical, tradition, he, developed, an, original, theory, of, temporally, modalized, syllogistic, and, made, use, of, inductive, logic, such, as, the, methods, of, agreement, difference, and, concomitant, variation, which, are, critical, to, the, scientific, method, early, islamic, metaphysics, imbued, as, it, is, with, islamic, theology, distinguishes, more, clearly, than, aristotelianism, the, difference, between, essence, and, existence, whereas, existence, is, the, domain, of, the, contingent, and, the, accidental, essence, endures, within, a, being, beyond, the, accidental, the, philosophy, of, ibn, s, n, particularly, that, part, relating, to, metaphysics, owes, much, to, al, farabi, the, search, for, a, truly, definitive, islamic, philosophy, can, be, seen, in, what, is, left, to, us, of, his, work, following, al, farabi, s, lead, avicenna, initiated, a, full, fledged, inquiry, into, the, question, of, being, in, which, he, distinguished, between, essence, mahiat, and, existence, wujud, he, argued, that, the, fact, of, existence, can, not, be, inferred, from, or, accounted, for, by, the, essence, of, existing, things, and, that, form, and, matter, by, themselves, cannot, interact, and, originate, the, movement, of, the, universe, or, the, progressive, actualization, of, existing, things, existence, must, therefore, be, due, to, an, agent, cause, that, necessitates, imparts, gives, or, adds, existence, to, an, essence, to, do, so, the, cause, must, be, an, existing, thing, and, coexist, with, its, effect, avicenna, s, proof, for, the, existence, of, god, was, the, first, ontological, argument, which, he, proposes, in, the, metaphysics, section, of, the, book, of, healing, this, was, the, first, attempt, at, using, the, method, of, a, priori, proof, which, utilizes, intuition, and, reason, alone, avicenna, s, proof, of, god, s, existence, is, unique, in, that, it, can, be, classified, as, both, a, cosmological, argument, and, an, ontological, argument, it, is, ontological, insofar, as, necessary, existence, in, intellect, is, the, first, basis, for, arguing, for, a, necessary, existent, the, proof, is, also, cosmological, insofar, as, most, of, it, is, taken, up, with, arguing, that, contingent, existents, cannot, stand, alone, and, must, end, up, in, a, necessary, existent, in, the, al, burhan, on, demonstration, section, of, the, book, avicenna, discusses, the, philosophy, of, science, and, describes, an, early, scientific, method, of, inquiry, he, discusses, aristotle, s, posterior, analytics, and, significantly, diverges, from, it, on, several, points, avicenna, explains, the, issue, of, a, proper, methodology, for, scientific, inquiry, and, the, question, of, how, does, one, acquire, the, first, principles, of, a, science, he, asks, how, a, scientist, would, arrive, at, the, initial, axioms, or, hypotheses, of, a, deductive, science, without, inferring, them, from, some, more, basic, premises, he, explains, that, the, ideal, situation, is, when, one, grasps, that, a, relation, holds, between, the, terms, which, would, allow, for, absolute, universal, certainty, avicenna, then, adds, two, further, methods, for, arriving, at, the, first, principles, the, ancient, aristotelian, method, of, induction, istiqra, and, the, method, of, examination, and, experimentation, tajriba, avicenna, criticizes, aristotelian, induction, arguing, that, it, does, not, lead, to, the, absolute, universal, and, certain, premises, that, it, purports, to, provide, in, its, place, he, develops, a, method, of, experimentation, as, a, means, for, scientific, inquiry, critical, editions, of, the, arabic, text, have, been, published, in, cairo, 1952, 83, originally, under, the, supervision, of, ibrahim, madkour, some, of, these, editions, are, given, below, byu, s, islamic, translation, series, includes, two, parts, of, the, healing
