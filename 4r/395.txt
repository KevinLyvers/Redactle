the, nyabinghi, rhythm, a, style, of, ritual, drumming, performed, as, a, communal, meditative, practice, in, the, rastafarian, life, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 20th, century, phonograph, records, became, of, central, importance, to, the, jamaican, music, industry, playing, a, significant, cultural, and, economic, role, in, the, development, of, reggae, music, in, the, early, 1950s, jamaican, entrepreneurs, began, issuing, 78s, but, this, format, would, soon, be, superseded, by, the, 7, single, first, released, in, 1949, in, 1951, the, first, recordings, of, mento, music, were, released, as, singles, and, showcased, two, styles, of, mento, an, acoustic, rural, style, and, a, jazzy, pop, style, other, 7, singles, to, appear, in, jamaica, around, this, time, were, covers, of, popular, american, r, b, hits, made, by, kingston, sound, system, operators, to, be, played, at, public, dances, meanwhile, jamaican, expatriates, started, issuing, 45s, on, small, independent, labels, in, the, united, kingdom, many, mastered, directly, from, jamaican, 45s, ska, arose, in, jamaican, studios, in, the, late, 1950s, developing, from, this, mix, of, american, r, b, mento, and, calypso, music, notable, for, its, jazz, influenced, horn, riffs, ska, is, characterized, by, a, quarter, note, walking, bass, line, guitar, and, piano, offbeats, and, a, drum, pattern, with, cross, stick, snare, and, bass, drum, on, the, backbeat, and, open, hi, hat, on, the, offbeats, when, jamaica, gained, independence, in, 1962, ska, became, the, music, of, choice, for, young, jamaicans, seeking, music, that, was, their, own, ska, also, became, popular, among, mods, in, britain, in, the, mid, 1960s, ska, gave, rise, to, rocksteady, a, genre, slower, than, ska, featuring, more, romantic, lyrics, and, less, prominent, horns, theories, abound, as, to, why, jamaican, musicians, slowed, the, ska, tempo, to, create, rocksteady, one, is, that, the, singer, hopeton, lewis, was, unable, to, sing, his, hit, song, take, it, easy, at, a, ska, tempo, the, name, rocksteady, was, codified, after, the, release, of, a, single, by, alton, ellis, many, rocksteady, rhythms, later, were, used, as, the, basis, of, reggae, recordings, whose, slower, tempos, allowed, for, the, double, skank, guitar, strokes, on, the, offbeat, reggae, developed, from, ska, and, rocksteady, in, the, late, 1960s, larry, and, alvin, s, nanny, goat, and, the, beltones, no, more, heartaches, were, among, the, songs, in, the, genre, the, beat, was, distinctive, from, rocksteady, in, that, it, dropped, any, of, the, pretensions, to, the, smooth, soulful, sound, that, characterized, slick, american, r, b, and, instead, was, closer, in, kinship, to, us, southern, funk, being, heavily, dependent, on, the, rhythm, section, to, drive, it, along, reggae, s, great, advantage, was, its, almost, limitless, flexibility, from, the, early, jerky, sound, of, lee, perry, s, people, funny, boy, to, the, uptown, sounds, of, third, world, s, now, that, we, ve, found, love, it, was, an, enormous, leap, through, the, years, and, styles, yet, both, are, instantly, recognizable, as, reggae, the, shift, from, rocksteady, to, reggae, was, illustrated, by, the, organ, shuffle, pioneered, by, jamaican, musicians, like, jackie, mittoo, and, winston, wright, and, featured, in, transitional, singles, say, what, you, re, saying, 1968, by, eric, monty, morris, and, people, funny, boy, 1968, by, lee, scratch, perry, early, 1968, was, when, the, first, bona, fide, reggae, records, were, released, nanny, goat, by, larry, marshall, and, no, more, heartaches, by, the, beltones, that, same, year, the, newest, jamaican, sound, began, to, spawn, big, name, imitators, in, other, countries, american, artist, johnny, nash, s, 1968, hit, hold, me, tight, has, been, credited, with, first, putting, reggae, in, the, american, listener, charts, around, the, same, time, reggae, influences, were, starting, to, surface, in, rock, and, pop, music, one, example, is, 1968, s, ob, la, di, ob, la, da, by, the, beatles, the, wailers, a, band, started, by, bob, marley, peter, tosh, and, bunny, wailer, in, 1963, is, perhaps, the, most, recognized, band, that, made, the, transition, through, all, three, stages, of, early, jamaican, popular, music, ska, rocksteady, and, reggae, over, a, dozen, wailers, songs, are, based, on, or, use, a, line, from, jamaican, mento, songs, other, significant, ska, artists, who, made, the, leap, to, reggae, include, prince, buster, desmond, dekker, ken, boothe, and, millie, small, best, known, for, her, 1964, blue, beat, ska, cover, version, of, my, boy, lollipop, which, was, a, smash, hit, internationally, notable, jamaican, producers, influential, in, the, development, of, ska, into, rocksteady, and, reggae, include, coxsone, dodd, lee, scratch, perry, leslie, kong, duke, reid, joe, gibbs, and, king, tubby, chris, blackwell, who, founded, island, records, in,

simon, s, single, mother, and, child, reunion, a, track, which, he, recorded, in, kingston, jamaica, with, jimmy, cliff, s, backing, group, was, ranked, by, billboard, as, the, no, 57, song, of, 1972, in, 1973, the, film, the, harder, they, come, starring, jimmy, cliff, was, released, and, introduced, jamaican, music, to, cinema, audiences, outside, jamaica, though, the, film, achieved, cult, status, its, limited, appeal, meant, that, it, had, a, smaller, impact, than, eric, clapton, s, 1974, cover, of, bob, marley, s, i, shot, the, sheriff, which, made, it, onto, the, playlists, of, mainstream, rock, and, pop, radio, stations, worldwide, clapton, s, i, shot, the, sheriff, used, modern, rock, production, and, recording, techniques, and, faithfully, retained, most, of, the, original, reggae, elements, it, was, a, breakthrough, pastiche, devoid, of, any, parody, and, played, an, important, part, in, bringing, the, music, of, bob, marley, to, a, wider, rock, audience, by, the, mid, 1970s, authentic, reggae, dub, plates, and, specials, were, getting, some, exposure, in, the, uk, on, john, peel, s, radio, show, who, promoted, the, genre, for, the, rest, of, his, career,

a, new, subgenre, of, lovers, rock, was, being, created, unlike, the, jamaican, music, of, the, same, name, which, was, mainly, dominated, by, male, artists, such, as, gregory, isaacs, the, south,

once, cerebral, socio, political, sensual, and, spiritual, the, term, cod, reggae, is, popularly, used, to, describe, reggae, done, by, non, caribbean, people, often, in, a, disparaging, manner, because, of, perceived, inauthenticity, boy, george, has, been, described, as, one, of, the, great, cod, reggae, artists, of, all, time, stylistically, reggae, incorporates, some, of, the, musical, elements, of, rhythm, and, blues, r, b, jazz, mento, calypso, african, and, latin, american, music, as, well, as, other, genres, reggae, scenes, consist, of, two, guitars, one, for, rhythm, and, one, for, lead, drums, congas, and, keyboards, with, a, couple, of, vocalists, reggae, is, played, in, 4, 4, time, because, the, symmetrical, rhythmic, pattern, does, not, lend, itself, to, other, time, signatures, such, as, 3, 4, one, of, the, most, easily, recognizable, elements, is, offbeat, rhythms, staccato, chords, played, by, a, guitar, or, piano, or, both, on, the, offbeats, of, the, measure, often, referred, to, as, the, skank, this, rhythmic, pattern, accents, the, second, and, fourth, beats, in, each, bar, and, combines, with, the, drum, s, emphasis, on, beat, three, to, create, a, unique, sense, of, phrasing, the, reggae, offbeat, can, be, counted, so, that, it, falls, between, each, count, as, an, and, example, 1, and, 2, and, 3, and, 4, and, etc, or, counted, as, a, half, time, feel, at, twice, the, tempo, so, it, falls, on, beats, 2, and, 4, this, is, in, contrast, to, the, way, most, other, popular, genres, focus, on, beat, one, the, downbeat, the, tempo, of, reggae, is, usually, slower, than, both, ska, and, rocksteady, it, is, this, slower, tempo, the, guitar, piano, offbeats, the, emphasis, on, the, third, beat, and, the, use, of, syncopated, melodic, bass, lines, that, differentiate, reggae, from, other, music, although, other, musical, styles, have, incorporated, some, of, these, innovations, reggae, drummers, often, involved, these, three, tips, for, other, reggae, performers, 1, go, for, open, ringing, tones, when, playing, ska, and, rocksteady, 2, use, any, available, material, to, stuff, the, bass, drum, so, that, it, tightens, up, the, kick, to, a, deep, punchy, thud, and, 3, go, without, a, ride, cymbal, focusing, on, the, hi, hat, for, timekeeping, and, thin, crashes, with, fast, decay, for, accents, the, guitar, in, reggae, usually, plays, on, the, off, beat, of, the, rhythm, so, if, one, is, counting, in, 4, 4, time, and, counting, 1, and, 2, and, 3, and, 4, and, one, would, play, a, downstroke, on, the, and, part, of, the, beat, a, musical, figure, known, as, skank, or, the, bang, has, a, very, dampened, short, and, scratchy, chop, sound, almost, like, a, percussion, instrument, sometimes, a, double, chop, is, used, when, the, guitar, still, plays, the, off, beats, but, also, plays, the, following, eighth, note, beats, on, the, up, stroke, an, example, is, the, intro, to, stir, it, up, by, the, wailers, artist, and, producer, derrick, harriott, says, what, happened, was, the, musical, thing, was, real, widespread, but, only, among, a, certain, sort, of, people, it, was, always, a, down, town, thing, but, more, than, just, hearing, the, music, the, equipment, was, so, powerful, and, the, vibe, so, strong, that, we, feel, it, the, reggae, organ, shuffle, is, unique, to, reggae, in, the, original, version, of, reggae, the, drummer, played, a, reggae, groove, that, was, used, in, the, four, bar, introduction, allowing, the, piano, to, serve, as, a, percussion, instrument, reggae, is, noted, for, its, tradition, of, social, criticism, in, its, lyrics, although, many, reggae, songs, discuss, lighter, more, personal, subjects, such, as, love, and, socializing, many, early, reggae, bands, covered, motown, or, atlantic, soul, and, funk, songs, some, reggae, lyrics, attempt, to, raise, the, political, consciousness, of, the, audience, such, as, by, criticizing, materialism, or, by, informing, the, listener, about, controversial, subjects, such, as, apartheid, many, reggae, songs, promote, the, use, of, cannabis, also, known, as, herb, ganja, or, sinsemilla, considered, a, sacrament, in, the, rastafari, movement, there, are, many, artists, who, utilize, religious, themes, in, their, music, whether, it, be, discussing, a, specific, religious, topic, or, simply, giving, praise, to, god, jah, other, common, socio, political, topics, in, reggae, songs, include, black, nationalism, anti, racism, anti, colonialism, anti, capitalism, and, criticism, of, political, systems, and, babylon, in, recent, years, jamaican, and, non, jamaican, reggae, musicians, have, used, more, positive, themes, in, reggae, music, the, music, is, widely, considered, a, treasured, cultural, export, for, jamaica, so, musicians, who, still, desire, progress, for, their, island, nation, have, begun, focusing, on, themes, of, hopefulness, faith, and, love, for, elementary, children, reggae, songs, such, as, give, a, little, love, one, love, or, three, little, birds, all, written, by, bob, marley, can, be, sung, and, enjoyed, for, their, optimism, and, cheerful, lyrics,
