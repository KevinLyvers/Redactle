discourse, on, the, method, of, rightly, conducting, one, s, reason, and, of, seeking, truth, in, the, sciences, french, discours, de, la, m, thode, pour, bien, conduire, sa, raison, et, chercher, la, v, rit, dans, les, sciences, is, a, philosophical, and, autobiographical, treatise, published, by, ren, descartes, in, 1637, it, is, best, known, as, the, source, of, the, famous, quotation, je, pense, donc, je, suis, i, think, therefore, i, am, or, i, am, thinking, therefore, i, exist, which, occurs, in, part, iv, of, the, work, a, similar, argument, without, this, precise, wording, is, found, in, meditations, on, first, philosophy, 1641, and, a, latin, version, of, the, same, statement, cogito, ergo, sum, is, found, in, principles, of, philosophy, 1644, discourse, on, the, method, is, one, of, the, most, influential, works, in, the, history, of, modern, philosophy, and, important, to, the, development, of, natural, sciences, in, this, work, descartes, tackles, the, problem, of, skepticism, which, had, previously, been, studied, by, other, philosophers, while, addressing, some, of, his, predecessors, and, contemporaries, descartes, modified, their, approach, to, account, for, a, truth, he, found, to, be, incontrovertible, he, started, his, line, of, reasoning, by, doubting, everything, so, as, to, assess, the, world, from, a, fresh, perspective, clear, of, any, preconceived, notions, the, book, was, originally, published, in, leiden, in, the, netherlands, later, it, was, translated, into, latin, and, published, in, 1656, in, amsterdam, the, book, was, intended, as, an, introduction, to, three, works, dioptrique, m, t, ores, and, g, om, trie, g, om, trie, contains, descartes, s, initial, concepts, that, later, developed, into, the, cartesian, coordinate, system, the, text, was, written, and, published, in, french, rather, than, latin, the, latter, being, the, language, in, which, most, philosophical, and, scientific, texts, were, written, and, published, at, that, time, most, of, descartes, other, works, were, written, in, latin, together, with, meditations, on, first, philosophy, principles, of, philosophy, and, rules, for, the, direction, of, the, mind, it, forms, the, base, of, the, epistemology, known, as, cartesianism, the, book, is, divided, into, six, parts, described, in, the, author, s, preface, as, descartes, begins, by, allowing, himself, some, wit, good, sense, is, of, all, things, among, men, the, most, equally, distributed, for, every, one, thinks, himself, so, abundantly, provided, with, it, that, those, even, who, are, the, most, difficult, to, satisfy, in, everything, else, do, not, usually, desire, a, larger, measure, of, this, quality, than, they, already, possess, a, similar, observation, can, be, found, in, hobbes, when, he, writes, about, human, abilities, specifically, wisdom, and, their, own, wit, but, this, proveth, rather, that, men, are, in, that, point, equal, than, unequal, for, there, is, not, ordinarily, a, greater, sign, of, the, equal, distribution, of, anything, than, that, every, man, is, contented, with, his, share, but, also, in, montaigne, whose, formulation, indicates, that, it, was, a, commonplace, at, the, time, tis, commonly, said, that, the, justest, portion, nature, has, given, us, of, her, favors, is, that, of, sense, for, there, is, no, one, who, is, not, contented, with, his, share, descartes, continues, with, a, warning, for, to, be, possessed, of, a, vigorous, mind, is, not, enough, the, prime, requisite, is, rightly, to, apply, it, the, greatest, minds, as, they, are, capable, of, the, highest, excellences, are, open, likewise, to, the, greatest, aberrations, and, those, who, travel, very, slowly, may, yet, make, far, greater, progress, provided, they, keep, always, to, the, straight, road, than, those, who, while, they, run, forsake, it, descartes, describes, his, disappointment, with, his, education, s, soon, as, i, had, finished, the, entire, course, of, study, i, found, myself, involved, in, so, many, doubts, and, errors, that, i, was, convinced, i, had, advanced, no, farther, than, the, discovery, at, every, turn, of, my, own, ignorance, he, notes, his, special, delight, with, mathematics, and, contrasts, its, strong, foundations, to, the, disquisitions, of, the, ancient, moralists, towering, and, magnificent, palaces, with, no, better, foundation, than, sand, and, mud, descartes, was, in, germany, attracted, thither, by, the, wars, in, that, country, and, describes, his, intent, by, a, building, metaphor, see, also, neurath, s, boat, he, observes, that, buildings, cities, or, nations, that, have, been, planned, by, a, single, hand, are, more, elegant, and, commodious, than, those, that, have, grown, organically, he, resolves, not, to, build, on, old, foundations, nor, to, lean, upon, principles, which, he, had, taken, on, faith, in, his, youth, descartes, seeks, to, ascertain, the, true, method, by, which, to, arrive, at, the, knowledge, of, whatever, lies, within, the, compass, of, his, powers, he, presents, four, precepts, the, first, was, never, to, accept, anything, for, true, which, i, did, not, clearly, know, to, be, such, that, is, to, say, carefully, to, avoid, precipitancy, and, prejudice, and, to, comprise, nothing, more, in, my, judgment, than, what, was, presented, to, my, mind, so, clearly, and, distinctly, as, to, exclude, all, ground, of, doubt, the, second, to, divide, each, of, the, difficulties, under, examination, into, as, many, parts, as, possible, and, as, might, be, necessary, for, its, adequate, solution, the, third, to, conduct, my, thoughts, in, such, order, that, by, commencing, with, objects, the, simplest, and, easiest, to, know, i, might, ascend, by, little, and, little, and, as, it, were, step, by, step, to, the, knowledge, of, the, more, complex, assigning, in, thought, a, certain, order, even, to, those, objects, which, in, their, own, nature, do, not, stand, in, a, relation, of, antecedence, and, sequence, and, the, last, in, every, case, to, make, enumerations, so, complete, and, reviews, so, general, that, i, might, be, assured, that, nothing, was, omitted, descartes, uses, the, analogy, of, rebuilding, a, house, from, secure, foundations, and, extends, the, analogy, to, the, idea, of, needing, a, temporary, abode, while, his, own, house, is, being, rebuilt, descartes, adopts, the, following, three, or, four, maxims, in, order, to, remain, effective, in, the, real, world, while, experimenting, with, his, method, of, radical, doubt, they, form, a, rudimentary, belief, system, from, which, to, act, before, his, new, system, is, fully, developed, finally, descartes, states, his, resolute, belief, that, there, is, no, better, use, of, his, time, than, to, cultivate, his, reason, and, to, advance, his, knowledge, of, the, truth, according, to, his, method, applying, the, method, to, itself, descartes, challenges, his, own, reasoning, and, reason, itself, but, descartes, believes, three, things, are, not, susceptible, to, doubt, and, the, three, support, each, other, to, form, a, stable, foundation, for, the, method, he, cannot, doubt, that, something, has, to, be, there, to, do, the, doubting, i, think, therefore, i, am, the, method, of, doubt, cannot, doubt, reason, as, it, is, based, on, reason, itself, by, reason, there, exists, a, god, and, god, is, the, guarantor, that, reason, is, not, misguided, descartes, supplies, three, different, proofs, for, the, existence, of, god, including, what, is, now, referred, to, as, the, ontological, proof, of, the, existence, of, god, descartes, briefly, sketches, how, in, an, unpublished, treatise, published, posthumously, as, le, monde, he, had, laid, out, his, ideas, regarding, the, laws, of, nature, the, sun, and, stars, the, moon, as, the, cause, of, ebb, and, flow, meaning, the, tides, gravitation, light, and, heat, describing, his, work, on, light, he, states, expounded, at, considerable, length, what, the, nature, of, that, light, must, be, which, is, found, in, the, sun, and, the, stars, and, how, thence, in, an, instant, of, time, it, traverses, the, immense, spaces, of, the, heavens, his, work, on, such, physico, mechanical, laws, is, however, framed, as, applying, not, to, our, world, but, to, a, theoretical, new, world, created, by, god, somewhere, in, the, imaginary, spaces, matter, sufficient, to, compose, agitate, variously, and, confusedly, the, different, parts, of, this, matter, so, that, there, resulted, a, chaos, as, disordered, as, the, poets, ever, feigned, and, after, that, did, nothing, more, than, lend, his, ordinary, concurrence, to, nature, and, allow, her, to, act, in, accordance, with, the, laws, which, he, had, established, descartes, does, this, to, express, my, judgment, regarding, with, greater, freedom, without, being, necessitated, to, adopt, or, refute, the, opinions, of, the, learned, descartes, hypothetical, world, would, be, a, deistic, universe, he, goes, on, to, say, that, he, was, not, however, disposed, from, these, circumstances, to, conclude, that, this, world, had, been, created, in, the, manner, i, described, for, it, is, much, more, likely, that, god, made, it, at, the, first, such, as, it, was, to, be, despite, this, admission, it, seems, that, descartes, project, for, understanding, the, world, was, that, of, re, creating, creation, a, cosmological, project, which, aimed, through, descartes, particular, brand, of, experimental, method, to, show, not, merely, the, possibility, of, such, a, system, but, to, suggest, that, this, way, of, looking, at, the, world, one, with, as, descartes, saw, it, no, assumptions, about, god, or, nature, provided, the, only, basis, upon, which, he, could, see, knowledge, progressing, as, he, states, in, book, ii, thus, in, descartes, work, we, can, see, some, of, the, fundamental, assumptions, of, modern, cosmology, in, evidence, the, project, of, examining, the, historical, construction, of, the, universe, through, a, set, of, quantitative, laws, describing, interactions, which, would, allow, the, ordered, present, to, be, constructed, from, a, chaotic, past, he, goes, on, to, the, motion, of, the, blood, in, the, heart, and, arteries, endorsing, the, findings, of, a, physician, of, england, about, the, circulation, of, blood, referring, to, william, harvey, and, his, work, de, motu, cordis, in, a, marginal, note, 51, but, then, he, disagrees, strongly, about, the, function, of, the, heart, as, a, pump, ascribing, the, motive, power, of, the, circulation, to, heat, rather, than, muscular, contraction, he, describes, that, these, motions, seem, to, be, totally, independent, of, what, we, think, and, concludes, that, our, bodies, are, separate, from, our, souls, he, does, not, seem, to, distinguish, between, mind, spirit, and, soul, all, of, which, he, identifies, with, our, faculty, for, rational, thinking, hence, the, term, i, think, therefore, i, am, all, three, of, these, words, particularly, mind, and, soul, can, be, signified, by, the, single, french, term, me, descartes, begins, by, obliquely, referring, to, the, recent, trial, of, galileo, for, heresy, and, the, church, s, condemnation, of, heliocentrism, he, explains, that, for, these, reasons, he, has, held, back, his, own, treatise, from, publication, however, he, says, because, people, have, begun, to, hear, of, his, work, he, is, compelled, to, publish, these, small, parts, of, it, that, is, the, discourse, dioptrique, m, t, ores, and, g, om, trie, in, order, that, people, not, wonder, why, he, doesn, t, publish, the, discourse, ends, with, some, discussion, of, scientific, experimentation, descartes, believes, that, experimentation, is, indispensable, time, consuming, and, yet, not, easily, delegated, to, others, he, exhorts, the, reader, to, investigate, the, claims, laid, out, in, dioptrique, m, t, ores, and, g, om, trie, and, communicate, their, findings, or, criticisms, to, his, publisher, he, commits, to, publishing, any, such, queries, he, receives, along, with, his, answers, skepticism, had, previously, been, discussed, by, philosophers, such, as, sextus, empiricus, al, kindi, al, ghazali, francisco, s, nchez, and, michel, de, montaigne, descartes, started, his, line, of, reasoning, by, doubting, everything, so, as, to, assess, the, world, from, a, fresh, perspective, clear, of, any, preconceived, notions, or, influences, this, is, summarized, in, the, book, s, first, precept, to, never, to, accept, anything, for, true, which, i, did, not, clearly, know, to, be, such, this, method, of, pro, foundational, skepticism, is, considered, to, be, the, start, of, modern, philosophy
