titania, he, calls, upon, robin, puck, goodfellow, his, shrewd, and, knavish, sprite, to, help, him, concoct, a, magical, juice, derived, from, a, flower, called, love, in, idleness, which, turns, from, white, to, purple, when, struck, by, cupid, s, arrow, when, the, concoction, is, applied, to, the, eyelids, of, a, sleeping, person, that, person, upon, waking, falls, in, love, with, the, first, living, thing, they, perceive, he, instructs, puck, to, retrieve, the, flower, with, the, hope, that, he, might, make, titania, fall, in, love, with, an, animal, of, the, forest, and, thereby, shame, her, into, giving, up, the, little, indian, boy, he, says, and, ere, i, take, this, charm, from, off, her, sight, as, i, can, take, it, with, another, herb, i, ll, make, her, render, up, her, page, to, me, helena, and, demetrius, enter, with, her, continuously, making, advances, towards, demetrius, promising, to, love, him, more, than, hermia, however, he, rebuffs, her, with, cruel, insults, observing, this, oberon, orders, puck, to, spread, some, of, the, magical, juice, from, the, flower, on, the, eyelids, of, the, young, athenian, man, as, titania, is, lulled, to, sleep, by, her, fairies, oberon, sneaks, up, and, places, the, flower, juice, on, her, eyes, exiting, the, stage, afterwards, lysander, and, hermia, enter, lost, and, exhausted, from, the, journey, hermia, rejects, lysander, s, advances, to, sleep, together, and, the, two, lie, down, on, different, corners, puck, enters, and, mistakes, lysander, for, demetrius, not, having, seen, either, before, and, administers, the, juice, to, the, sleeping, lysander, helena, coming, across, him, wakes, him, while, attempting, to, determine, whether, he, is, dead, or, asleep, upon, this, happening, lysander, immediately, falls, in, love, with, helena, helena, thinking, lysander, is, mocking, her, runs, away, lysander, follows, her, when, hermia, wakes, up, after, dreaming, a, snake, ate, her, heart, she, sees, that, lysander, is, gone, and, goes, out, in, the, woods, to, find, him, meanwhile, quince, and, his, band, of, five, labourers, rude, mechanicals, as, puck, describes, them, have, arranged, to, perform, their, play, about, pyramus, and, thisbe, for, theseus, s, wedding, and, venture, into, the, forest, near, titania, s, bower, for, their, rehearsal, quince, leads, the, actors, in, their, rehearsal, of, the, play, bottom, is, spotted, by, puck, who, taking, his, name, to, be, another, word, for, a, jackass, transforms, his, head, into, that, of, a, donkey, when, bottom, returns, for, his, next, lines, the, other, workmen, run, screaming, in, terror, they, claim, that, they, are, haunted, much, to, bottom, s, confusion, determined, to, await, his, friends, he, begins, to, sing, to, himself, titania, having, received, the, love, potion, is, awakened, by, bottom, s, singing, and, immediately, falls, in, love, with, him, in, the, words, of, the, play, titania, waked, and, straightway, loved, an, ass, she, lavishes, him, with, the, attention, of, her, and, her, fairies, and, while, she, is, in, this, state, of, devotion, oberon, takes, the, changeling, boy, oberon, sees, demetrius, still, following, hermia, when, demetrius, goes, to, sleep, oberon, condemns, puck, s, mistake, and, sends, him, to, get, helena, while, he, charms, demetrius, s, eyes, upon, waking, up, he, sees, lysander, and, helena, and, instantly, falls, for, her, now, under, the, spell, the, two, men, have, fallen, for, her, however, helena, is, convinced, that, her, two, suitors, are, mocking, her, as, neither, loved, her, originally, hermia, finds, lysander, and, asks, why, he, left, her, but, lysander, claims, he, never, loved, hermia, instead, loving, helena, this, soon, turns, into, a, quarrel, between, the, two, ladies, with, helena, chiding, hermia, for, joining, in, the, mockery, session, followed, by, the, latter, furiously, charging, at, her, for, stealing, her, true, love, s, heart, and, blaming, her, for, the, supposed, mockery, oberon, and, puck, decide, that, they, must, resolve, this, conflict, and, by, the, morning, none, of, them, will, have, any, memory, of, what, happened, as, if, it, were, a, dream, oberon, arranges, everything, so, helena, hermia, demetrius, and, lysander, will, all, believe, they, have, been, dreaming, when, they, awaken, puck, distracts, lysander, and, demetrius, from, fighting, over, helena, s, love, by, mimicking, their, voices, and, leading, them, apart, eventually, all, four, find, themselves, separately, falling, asleep, in, the, glade, once, they, fall, asleep, puck, administers, the, love, potion, to, lysander, again, returning, his, love, to, hermia, again, and, cast, another, spell, over, the, four, athenian, lovers, claiming, all, will, be, well, in, the, morning, once, they, awaken, the, lovers, assume, that, whatever, happened, was, a, dream, and, not, reality, having, achieved, his, goals, oberon, releases, titania, and, orders, puck, to, remove, the, donkey, s, head, from, bottom, the, fairies, then, disappear, and, theseus, and, hippolyta, arrive, on, the, scene, during, an, early, morning, hunt, they, find, the, lovers, still, sleeping, in, the, glade, they, wake, up, the, lovers, and, since, demetrius, no, longer, loves, hermia, theseus, over, rules, egeus, s, demands, and, arranges, a, group, wedding, the, lovers, at, first, believe, they, are, still, in, a, dream, and, cannot, recall, what, has, happened, the, lovers, decide, that, the, night, s, events, must, have, been, a, dream, as, they, walk, back, to, athens, after, they, exit, bottom, awakes, and, he, too, decides, that, he, must, have, experienced, a, dream, past, the, wit, of, man, at, quince, s, house, quince, and, his, team, of, actors, worry, that, bottom, has, gone, missing, quince, laments, that, bottom, is, the, only, man, who, can, take, on, the, lead, role, of, pyramus, bottom, returns, and, the, actors, get, ready, to, put, on, pyramus, and, thisbe, in, the, final, scene, of, the, play, theseus, hippolyta, and, the, lovers, watch, the, six, workmen, perform, pyramus, and, thisbe, in, athens, the, mechanicals, are, so, terrible, at, playing, their, roles, that, the, guests, laugh, as, if, it, were, meant, to, be, a, comedy, and, everyone, retires, to, bed, afterwards, oberon, titania, puck, and, other, fairies, enter, and, bless, the, house, and, its, occupants, with, good, fortune, after, all, the, other, characters, leave, puck, restores, amends, and, suggests, that, what, the, audience, experienced, might, just, be, a, dream, it, is, unknown, exactly, when, a, midsummer, night, s, dream, was, written, or, first, performed, but, on, the, basis, of, topical, references, and, an, allusion, to, edmund, spenser, s, epithalamion, it, is, usually, dated, 1595, or, early, 1596, some, have, theorised, that, the, play, might, have, been, written, for, an, aristocratic, wedding, for, example, that, of, thomas, berkeley, and, elizabeth, carey, while, others, suggest, that, it, was, written, for, the, queen, to, celebrate, the, feast, day, of, st, john, but, no, evidence, exists, to, support, this, theory, in, any, case, it, would, have, been, performed, at, the, theatre, and, later, the, globe, though, it, is, not, a, translation, or, adaptation, of, an, earlier, work, various, sources, such, as, ovid, s, metamorphoses, and, chaucer, s, the, knight, s, tale, served, as, inspiration, aristophanes, classical, greek, comedy, the, birds, also, set, in, the, countryside, near, athens, has, been, proposed, as, a, source, due, to, the, fact, that, both, procne, and, titania, are, awakened, by, male, characters, hoopoe, and, bottom, the, weaver, who, have, animal, heads, and, who, sing, two, stanza, songs, about, birds, according, to, john, twyning, the, play, s, plot, of, four, lovers, undergoing, a, trial, in, the, woods, was, intended, as, a, riff, on, der, busant, a, middle, high, german, poem, according, to, dorothea, kehler, the, writing, period, can, be, placed, between, 1594, and, 1596, which, means, that, shakespeare, had, probably, already, completed, romeo, and, juliet, and, was, still, in, contemplation, of, the, merchant, of, venice, the, play, belongs, to, the, author, s, early, middle, period, a, time, when, shakespeare, devoted, primary, attention, to, the, lyricism, of, his, works, the, play, was, entered, into, the, register, of, the, stationers, company, on, 8, october, 1600, by, the, bookseller, thomas, fisher, who, published, the, first, quarto, edition, later, that, year, a, second, quarto, was, printed, in, 1619, by, william, jaggard, as, part, of, his, so, called, false, folio, the, play, next, appeared, in, print, in, the, first, folio, of, 1623, the, title, page, of, q1, states, that, the, play, was, sundry, times, publickely, acted, prior, to, 1600, according, to, sukanta, chaudhuri, editor, of, the, 2017, arden, edition, of, a, midsummer, night, s, dream, the, only, firm, evidence, for, the, date, of, dream, is, its, mention, in, francis, meres, s, palladis, tamia, which, appeared, in, 1598, p, 283, chaudhuri, s, exhaustive, investigation, of, its, original, date, of, performance, points, to, 1595, or, 1596, likely, for, the, wedding, of, either, william, stanley, sixth, earl, of, derby, to, elizabeth, de, vere, or, thomas, berkeley, son, of, henry, lord, berkeley, to, elizabeth, carey, p, 284, 5, further, consolidations, of, this, late, elizabethan, date, are, provided, by, oberon, s, unmissable, compliment, to, queen, elizabeth, 2, 1, 155, 164, chaudhuri, and, titania, s, description, of, flooded, fields, and, failed, crops, which, occurred, through, england, in, the, years, 1594, 1597, 8, 2, 1, 84, 121, the, first, court, performance, known, with, certainty, occurred, at, hampton, court, on, 1, january, 1604, as, a, prelude, to, the, masque, of, indian, and, china, knights, in, ancient, greece, long, before, the, creation, of, the, christian, celebrations, of, st, john, s, day, the, summer, solstice, was, marked, by, adonia, a, festival, to, mourn, the, death, of, adonis, the, devoted, mortal, lover, of, the, goddess, aphrodite, according, to, ovid, s, metamorphoses, aphrodite, took, the, orphaned, infant, adonis, to, the, underworld, to, be, raised, by, persephone, he, grew, to, be, a, beautiful, young, man, and, when, aphrodite, returned, to, retrieve, him, persephone, did, not, want, to, let, him, go, zeus, settled, the, dispute, by, giving, adonis, one, third, of, the, year, with, persephone, one, third, of, the, year, with, aphrodite, and, the, remaining, third, where, he, chose, adonis, chose, to, spend, two, thirds, of, the, year, with, his, paramour, aphrodite, he, bled, to, death, in, his, lover, s, arms, after, being, gored, by, a, boar, mythology, has, various, stories, attributing, the, colour, of, certain, flowers, to, staining, by, the, blood, of, adonis, or, aphrodite, the, story, of, venus, and, adonis, was, well, known, to, the, elizabethans, and, inspired, many, works, including, shakespeare, s, own, hugely, popular, narrative, poem, venus, and, adonis, written, while, london, s, theatres, were, closed, because, of, plague, it, was, published, in, 1593, the, wedding, of, theseus, and, hippolyta, and, the, mistaken, and, waylaid, lovers, titania, and, bottom, even, the, erstwhile, acting, troupe, model, various, aspects, and, forms, of, love, both, david, wiles, of, the, university, of, london, and, harold, bloom, of, yale, university, have, strongly, endorsed, the, reading, of, this, play, under, the, themes, of, carnivalesque, bacchanalia, and, saturnalia, writing, in, 1998, david, wiles, stated, that, the, starting, point, for, my, own, analysis, will, be, the, proposition, that, although, we, encounter, a, midsummer, night, s, dream, as, a, text, it, was, historically, part, of, an, aristocratic, carnival, it, was, written, for, a, wedding, and, part, of, the, festive, structure, of, the, wedding, night, the, audience, who, saw, the, play, in, the, public, theatre, in, the, months, that, followed, became, vicarious, participants, in, an, aristocratic, festival, from, which, they, were, physically, excluded, my, purpose, will, be, to, demonstrate, how, closely, the, play, is, integrated, with, a, historically, specific, upper, class, celebration, wiles, argued, in, 1993, that, the, play, was, written, to, celebrate, the, carey, berkeley, wedding, the, date, of, the, wedding, was, fixed, to, coincide, with, a, conjunction, of, venus, and, the, new, moon, highly, propitious, for, conceiving, an, heir, david, bevington, argues, that, the, play, represents, the, dark, side, of, love, he, writes, that, the, fairies, make, light, of, love, by, mistaking, the, lovers, and, by, applying, a, love, potion, to, queen, titania, s, eyes, forcing, her, to, fall, in, love, with, an, ass, in, the, forest, both, couples, are, beset, by, problems, hermia, and, lysander, are, both, met, by, puck, who, provides, some, comic, relief, in, the, play, by, confounding, the, four, lovers, in, the, forest, however, the, play, also, alludes, to, serious, themes, at, the, end, of, the, play, hippolyta, and, theseus, happily, married, watch, the, play, about, the, unfortunate, lovers, pyramus, and, thisbe, and, are, able, to, enjoy, and, laugh, at, it, helena, and, demetrius, are, both, oblivious, to, the, dark, side, of, their, love, totally, unaware, of, what, may, have, come, of, the, events, in, the, forest, there, is, a, dispute, over, the, scenario, of, the, play, as, it, is, cited, at, first, by, theseus, that, four, happy, days, bring, in, another, moon, the, wood, episode, then, takes, place, at, a, night, of, no, moon, but, lysander, asserts, that, there, will, be, so, much, light, in, the, very, night, they, will, escape, that, dew, on, the, grass, will, be, shining, like, liquid, pearls, also, in, the, next, scene, quince, states, that, they, will, rehearse, in, moonlight, which, creates, a, real, confusion, it, is, possible, that, the, moon, set, during, the, night, allowing, lysander, to, escape, in, the, moonlight, and, for, the, actors, to, rehearse, then, for, the, wood, episode, to, occur, without, moonlight, theseus, s, statement, can, also, be, interpreted, to, mean, four, days, until, the, next, month, another, possibility, is, that, since, each, month, there, are, roughly, four, consecutive, nights, that, the, moon, is, not, seen, due, to, its, closeness, to, the, sun, in, the, sky, the, two, nights, before, the, moment, of, new, moon, followed, by, the, two, following, it, it, may, in, this, fashion, indicate, a, liminal, dark, of, the, moon, period, full, of, magical, possibilities, this, is, further, supported, by, hippolyta, s, opening, lines, exclaiming, and, then, the, moon, like, to, a, silver, bow, new, bent, in, heaven, shall, behold, the, night, of, our, solemnities, the, thin, crescent, shaped, moon, being, the, hallmark, of, the, new, moon, s, return, to, the, skies, each, month, the, play, also, intertwines, the, midsummer, eve, of, the, title, with, may, day, furthering, the, idea, of, a, confusion, of, time, and, the, seasons, this, is, evidenced, by, theseus, commenting, on, some, slumbering, youths, that, they, observe, the, rite, of, may, maurice, hunt, former, chair, of, the, english, department, at, baylor, university, writes, of, the, blurring, of, the, identities, of, fantasy, and, reality, in, the, play, that, make, possible, that, pleasing, narcotic, dreaminess, associated, with, the, fairies, of, the, play, by, emphasising, this, theme, even, in, the, setting, of, the, play, shakespeare, prepares, the, reader, s, mind, to, accept, the, fantastic, reality, of, the, fairy, world, and, its, happenings, this, also, seems, to, be, the, axis, around, which, the, plot, conflicts, in, the, play, occur, hunt, suggests, that, it, is, the, breaking, down, of, individual, identities, that, leads, to, the, central, conflict, in, the, story, it, is, the, brawl, between, oberon, and, titania, based, on, a, lack, of, recognition, for, the, other, in, the, relationship, that, drives, the, rest, of, the, drama, in, the, story, and, makes, it, dangerous, for, any, of, the, other, lovers, to, come, together, due, to, the, disturbance, of, nature, caused, by, a, fairy, dispute, similarly, this, failure, to, identify, and, to, distinguish, is, what, leads, puck, to, mistake, one, set, of, lovers, for, another, in, the, forest, placing, the, flower, s, juice, on, lysander, s, eyes, instead, of, demetrius, victor, kiernan, a, marxist, scholar, and, historian, writes, that, it, is, for, the, greater, sake, of, love, that, this, loss, of, identity, takes, place, and, that, individual, characters, are, made, to, suffer, accordingly, it, was, the, more, extravagant, cult, of, love, that, struck, sensible, people, as, irrational, and, likely, to, have, dubious, effects, on, its, acolytes, he, believes, that, identities, in, the, play, are, not, so, much, lost, as, they, are, blended, together, to, create, a, type, of, haze, through, which, distinction, becomes, nearly, impossible, it, is, driven, by, a, desire, for, new, and, more, practical, ties, between, characters, as, a, means, of, coping, with, the, strange, world, within, the, forest, even, in, relationships, as, diverse, and, seemingly, unrealistic, as, the, brief, love, between, titania, and, bottom, it, was, the, tidal, force, of, this, social, need, that, lent, energy, to, relationships, the, aesthetics, scholar, david, marshall, draws, out, this, theme, even, further, by, noting, that, the, loss, of, identity, reaches, its, fullness, in, the, description, of, the, mechanicals, and, their, assumption, of, other, identities, in, describing, the, occupations, of, the, acting, troupe, he, writes, two, construct, or, put, together, two, mend, and, repair, one, weaves, and, one, sews, all, join, together, what, is, apart, or, mend, what, has, been, rent, broken, or, sundered, in, marshall, s, opinion, this, loss, of, individual, identity, not, only, blurs, specificities, it, creates, new, identities, found, in, community, which, marshall, points, out, may, lead, to, some, understanding, of, shakespeare, s, opinions, on, love, and, marriage, further, the, mechanicals, understand, this, theme, as, they, take, on, their, individual, parts, for, a, corporate, performance, of, pyramus, and, thisbe, marshall, remarks, that, to, be, an, actor, is, to, double, and, divide, oneself, to, discover, oneself, in, two, parts, both, oneself, and, not, oneself, both, the, part, and, not, the, part, he, claims, that, the, mechanicals, understand, this, and, that, each, character, particularly, among, the, lovers, has, a, sense, of, laying, down, individual, identity, for, the, greater, benefit, of, the, group, or, pairing, it, seems, that, a, desire, to, lose, one, s, individuality, and, find, identity, in, the, love, of, another, is, what, quietly, moves, the, events, of, a, midsummer, night, s, dream, as, the, primary, sense, of, motivation, this, desire, is, reflected, even, in, the, scenery, depictions, and, the, story, s, overall, mood, in, his, essay, preposterous, pleasures, queer, theories, and, a, midsummer, night, s, dream, douglas, e, green, explores, possible, interpretations, of, alternative, sexuality, that, he, finds, within, the, text, of, the, play, in, juxtaposition, to, the, proscribed, social, mores, of, the, culture, at, the, time, the, play, was, written, he, writes, that, his, essay, does, not, seek, to, rewrite, a, midsummer, night, s, dream, as, a, gay, play, but, rather, explores, some, of, its, homoerotic, significations, moments, of, queer, disruption, and, eruption, in, this, shakespearean, comedy, green, does, not, consider, shakespeare, to, have, been, a, sexual, radical, but, that, the, play, represented, a, topsy, turvy, world, or, temporary, holiday, that, mediates, or, negotiates, the, discontents, of, civilisation, which, while, resolved, neatly, in, the, story, s, conclusion, do, not, resolve, so, neatly, in, real, life, green, writes, that, the, sodomitical, elements, homoeroticism, lesbianism, and, even, compulsory, heterosexuality, the, first, hint, of, which, may, be, oberon, s, obsession, with, titania, s, changeling, ward, in, the, story, must, be, considered, in, the, context, of, the, culture, of, early, modern, england, as, a, commentary, on, the, aesthetic, rigidities, of, comic, form, and, political, ideologies, of, the, prevailing, order, male, dominance, is, one, thematic, element, found, in, the, play, in, a, midsummer, night, s, dream, lysander, and, hermia, escape, into, the, woods, for, a, night, where, they, do, not, fall, under, the, laws, of, theseus, or, egeus, upon, their, arrival, in, athens, the, couples, are, married, marriage, is, seen, as, the, ultimate, social, achievement, for, women, while, men, can, go, on, to, do, many, other, great, things, and, gain, social, recognition, in, the, imperial, votaress, louis, montrose, draws, attention, to, male, and, female, gender, roles, and, norms, present, in, the, comedy, in, connection, with, elizabethan, culture, in, reference, to, the, triple, wedding, he, says, the, festive, conclusion, in, a, midsummer, night, s, dream, depends, upon, the, success, of, a, process, by, which, the, feminine, pride, and, power, manifested, in, amazon, warriors, possessive, mothers, unruly, wives, and, wilful, daughters, are, brought, under, the, control, of, lords, and, husbands, he, says, that, the, consummation, of, marriage, is, how, power, over, a, woman, changes, hands, from, father, to, husband, a, connection, is, drawn, between, flowers, and, sexuality, montrose, sees, the, juice, employed, by, oberon, as, symbolising, menstrual, blood, as, well, as, the, sexual, blood, shed, by, virgins, while, blood, as, a, result, of, menstruation, is, representative, of, a, woman, s, power, blood, as, a, result, of, a, first, sexual, encounter, represents, man, s, power, over, women, there, are, points, in, the, play, however, when, there, is, an, absence, of, patriarchal, control, in, his, book, power, on, display, leonard, tennenhouse, says, the, problem, in, a, midsummer, night, s, dream, is, the, problem, of, authority, gone, archaic, the, athenian, law, requiring, a, daughter, to, die, if, she, does, not, do, her, father, s, will, is, outdated, tennenhouse, contrasts, the, patriarchal, rule, of, theseus, in, athens, with, that, of, oberon, in, the, carnivalistic, faerie, world, the, disorder, in, the, land, of, the, fairies, completely, opposes, the, world, of, athens, he, states, that, during, times, of, carnival, and, festival, male, power, is, broken, down, for, example, what, happens, to, the, four, lovers, in, the, woods, as, well, as, bottom, s, dream, represents, chaos, that, contrasts, with, theseus, political, order, however, theseus, does, not, punish, the, lovers, for, their, disobedience, according, to, tennenhouse, by, forgiving, the, lovers, he, has, made, a, distinction, between, the, law, of, the, patriarch, egeus, and, that, of, the, monarch, theseus, creating, two, different, voices, of, authority, this, can, be, compared, to, the, time, of, elizabeth, i, in, which, monarchs, were, seen, as, having, two, bodies, the, body, natural, and, the, body, politic, tennenhouse, says, that, elizabeth, s, succession, itself, represented, both, the, voice, of, a, patriarch, and, the, voice, of, a, monarch, 1, her, father, s, will, which, stated, that, the, crown, should, pass, to, her, and, 2, the, fact, that, she, was, the, daughter, of, a, king, dorothea, kehler, has, attempted, to, trace, the, criticism, of, the, work, through, the, centuries, the, earliest, such, piece, of, criticism, that, she, found, was, a, 1662, entry, in, the, diary, of, samuel, pepys, he, found, the, play, to, be, the, most, insipid, ridiculous, play, that, ever, i, saw, in, my, life, he, did, however, admit, that, it, had, some, good, dancing, and, some, handsome, women, which, was, all, my, pleasure, the, next, critic, known, to, comment, on, the, play, was, john, dryden, writing, the, authors, apology, for, heroique, poetry, and, poetique, licence, in, 1677, he, was, preoccupied, with, the, question, of, whether, fairies, should, be, depicted, in, theatrical, plays, since, they, did, not, exist, he, concluded, that, poets, should, be, allowed, to, depict, things, which, do, not, exist, but, derive, from, popular, belief, and, fairies, are, of, this, sort, as, are, pygmies, and, the, extraordinary, effects, of, magic, based, on, this, reasoning, dryden, defended, the, merits, of, three, fantasy, plays, a, midsummer, night, s, dream, the, tempest, and, ben, jonson, s, the, masque, of, queens, charles, gildon, in, the, early, 18th, century, recommended, this, play, for, its, beautiful, reflections, descriptions, similes, and, topics, gildon, thought, that, shakespeare, drew, inspiration, from, the, works, of, ovid, and, virgil, and, that, he, could, read, them, in, the, original, latin, and, not, in, later, translations, william, duff, writing, in, the, 1770s, also, recommended, this, play, he, felt, the, depiction, of, the, supernatural, was, among, shakespeare, s, strengths, not, weaknesses, he, especially, praised, the, poetry, and, wit, of, the, fairies, and, the, quality, of, the, verse, involved, his, contemporary, francis, gentleman, an, admirer, of, shakespeare, was, much, less, appreciative, of, this, play, he, felt, that, the, poetry, the, characterisation, and, the, originality, of, the, play, were, its, strengths, but, that, its, major, weaknesses, were, a, puerile, plot, and, that, it, consists, of, an, odd, mixture, of, incidents, the, connection, of, the, incidents, to, each, other, seemed, rather, forced, to, gentleman, edmond, malone, a, shakespearean, scholar, and, critic, of, the, late, 18th, century, found, another, supposed, flaw, in, this, particular, play, its, lack, of, a, proper, decorum, he, found, that, the, more, exalted, characters, the, aristocrats, of, athens, are, subservient, to, the, interests, of, those, beneath, them, in, other, words, the, lower, class, characters, play, larger, roles, than, their, betters, and, overshadow, them, he, found, this, to, be, a, grave, error, of, the, writer, malone, thought, that, this, play, had, to, be, an, early, and, immature, work, of, shakespeare, and, by, implication, that, an, older, writer, would, know, better, malone, s, main, argument, seems, to, derive, from, the, classism, of, his, era, he, assumes, that, the, aristocrats, had, to, receive, more, attention, in, the, narrative, and, to, be, more, important, more, distinguished, and, better, than, the, lower, class, according, to, kehler, significant, 19th, century, criticism, began, in, 1808, with, august, wilhelm, schlegel, schlegel, perceived, unity, in, the, multiple, plot, lines, he, noted, that, the, donkey, s, head, is, not, a, random, transformation, but, reflects, bottom, s, true, nature, he, identified, the, tale, of, pyramus, and, thisbe, as, a, burlesque, of, the, athenian, lovers, in, 1817, william, hazlitt, found, the, play, to, be, better, as, a, written, work, than, a, staged, production, he, found, the, work, to, be, a, delightful, fiction, but, when, staged, it, is, reduced, to, a, dull, pantomime, he, concluded, that, poetry, and, the, stage, do, not, fit, together, kehler, finds, the, comment, to, be, more, of, an, indication, of, the, quality, of, the, theatrical, productions, available, to, hazlitt, rather, than, a, true, indication, of, the, play, s, supposed, unsuitability, to, the, stage, she, notes, that, prior, to, the, 1840s, all, stage, productions, of, this, play, were, adaptations, unfaithful, to, the, original, text, in, 1811, 1812, samuel, taylor, coleridge, made, two, points, of, criticism, about, this, play, the, first, was, that, the, entire, play, should, be, seen, as, a, dream, second, that, helena, is, guilty, of, ungrateful, treachery, to, hermia, he, thought, that, this, was, a, reflection, of, the, lack, of, principles, in, women, who, are, more, likely, to, follow, their, own, passions, and, inclinations, than, men, women, in, his, view, feel, less, abhorrence, for, moral, evil, though, they, are, concerned, with, its, outward, consequences, coleridge, was, probably, the, earliest, critic, to, introduce, gender, issues, to, the, analysis, of, this, play, kehler, dismisses, his, views, on, helena, as, indications, of, coleridge, s, own, misogyny, rather, than, genuine, reflections, of, helena, s, morality, in, 1837, william, maginn, produced, essays, on, the, play, he, turned, his, attention, to, theseus, speech, about, the, lunatic, the, lover, and, the, poet, and, to, hippolyta, s, response, to, it, he, regarded, theseus, as, the, voice, of, shakespeare, himself, and, the, speech, as, a, call, for, imaginative, audiences, he, also, viewed, bottom, as, a, lucky, man, on, whom, fortune, showered, favours, beyond, measure, he, was, particularly, amused, by, the, way, bottom, reacts, to, the, love, of, the, fairy, queen, completely, unfazed, maginn, argued, that, theseus, would, have, bent, in, reverent, awe, before, titania, bottom, treats, her, as, carelessly, as, if, she, were, the, wench, of, the, next, door, tapster, finally, maginn, thought, that, oberon, should, not, be, blamed, for, titania, s, humiliation, which, is, the, result, of, an, accident, he, viewed, oberon, as, angry, with, the, caprices, of, his, queen, but, unable, to, anticipate, that, her, charmed, affections, would, be, reserved, for, a, weaver, with, a, donkey, s, head, in, 1839, the, philosopher, hermann, ulrici, wrote, that, the, play, and, its, depiction, of, human, life, reflected, the, views, of, platonism, in, his, view, shakespeare, implied, that, human, life, is, nothing, but, a, dream, suggesting, influence, from, plato, and, his, followers, who, thought, human, reality, is, deprived, of, all, genuine, existence, ulrici, noted, the, way, theseus, and, hippolyta, behave, here, like, ordinary, people, he, agreed, with, malone, that, this, did, not, fit, their, stations, in, life, but, viewed, this, behaviour, as, an, indication, of, parody, about, class, differences, james, halliwell, phillipps, writing, in, the, 1840s, found, that, there, were, many, inconsistencies, in, the, play, but, considered, it, the, most, beautiful, poetical, drama, ever, written, in, 1849, charles, knight, also, wrote, about, the, play, and, its, apparent, lack, of, proper, social, stratification, he, thought, that, this, play, indicated, shakespeare, s, maturity, as, a, playwright, and, that, its, thesean, harmony, reflects, proper, decorum, of, character, he, also, viewed, bottom, as, the, best, drawn, character, with, his, self, confidence, authority, and, self, love, he, argued, that, bottom, stands, as, a, representative, of, the, whole, human, race, like, hazlitt, he, felt, that, the, work, is, best, appreciated, when, read, as, a, text, rather, than, acted, on, stage, he, found, the, writing, to, be, subtle, and, ethereal, and, standing, above, literary, criticism, and, its, reductive, reasoning, also, in, 1849, georg, gottfried, gervinus, wrote, extensively, about, the, play, he, denied, the, theory, that, this, play, should, be, seen, as, a, dream, he, argued, that, it, should, be, seen, as, an, ethical, construct, and, an, allegory, he, thought, that, it, was, an, allegorical, depiction, of, the, errors, of, sensual, love, which, is, likened, to, a, dream, in, his, view, hermia, lacks, in, filial, obedience, and, acts, as, if, devoid, of, conscience, when, she, runs, away, with, lysander, lysander, is, also, guilty, for, disobeying, and, mocking, his, prospective, father, in, law, pyramus, and, thisbe, also, lack, in, filial, obedience, since, they, woo, by, moonlight, behind, their, parents, backs, the, fairies, in, his, view, should, be, seen, as, personified, dream, gods, they, represent, the, caprices, of, superficial, love, and, they, lack, in, intellect, feeling, and, ethics, gervinus, also, wrote, on, where, the, fairyland, of, the, play, is, located, not, in, attica, but, in, the, indies, his, views, on, the, indies, seem, to, kehler, to, be, influenced, by, orientalism, he, speaks, of, the, indies, as, scented, with, the, aroma, of, flowers, and, as, the, place, where, mortals, live, in, the, state, of, a, half, dream, gervinus, denies, and, devalues, the, loyalty, of, titania, to, her, friend, he, views, this, supposed, friendship, as, not, grounded, in, spiritual, association, titania, merely, delight, in, her, beauty, her, swimming, gait, and, her, powers, of, imitation, gervinus, further, views, titania, as, an, immoral, character, for, not, trying, to, reconcile, with, her, husband, in, her, resentment, titania, seeks, separation, from, him, for, which, gervinus, blames, her, gervinus, wrote, with, elitist, disdain, about, the, mechanicals, of, the, play, and, their, acting, aspirations, he, described, them, as, homely, creatures, with, hard, hands, and, thick, heads, they, are, in, his, view, ignorant, men, who, compose, and, act, in, plays, merely, for, financial, reward, they, are, not, real, artists, gervinus, reserves, his, praise, and, respect, only, for, theseus, who, he, thinks, represents, the, intellectual, man, like, several, of, his, predecessors, gervinus, thought, that, this, work, should, be, read, as, a, text, and, not, acted, on, stage, in, 1863, charles, cowden, clarke, also, wrote, on, this, play, kehler, notes, he, was, the, husband, of, famous, shakespearean, scholar, mary, cowden, clarke, charles, was, more, appreciative, of, the, lower, class, mechanicals, of, the, play, he, commented, favourably, on, their, individualisation, and, their, collective, richness, of, character, he, thought, that, bottom, was, conceited, but, good, natured, and, shows, a, considerable, store, of, imagination, in, his, interaction, with, the, representatives, of, the, fairy, world, he, also, argued, that, bottom, s, conceit, was, a, quality, inseparable, from, his, secondary, profession, that, of, an, actor, in, 1872, henry, n, hudson, an, american, clergyman, and, editor, of, shakespeare, also, wrote, comments, on, this, play, kehler, pays, little, attention, to, his, writings, as, they, were, largely, derivative, of, previous, works, she, notes, however, that, hudson, too, believed, that, the, play, should, be, viewed, as, a, dream, he, cited, the, lightness, of, the, characterisation, as, supporting, of, his, view, in, 1881, edward, dowden, argued, that, theseus, and, his, reflections, on, art, are, central, to, the, play, he, also, argued, that, theseus, was, one, of, the, heroic, men, of, action, so, central, to, shakespeare, s, theatrical, works, both, horace, howard, furness, and, henry, austin, clapp, were, more, concerned, with, the, problem, of, the, play, s, duration, though, they, held, opposing, views, clapp, writing, in, 1885, commented, on, the, inconsistency, of, the, time, depicted, in, the, play, as, it, should, take, place, in, four, days, and, nights, and, seems, to, last, less, than, two, and, felt, that, this, added, to, the, unrealistic, quality, of, the, play, furness, defending, the, play, in, 1895, felt, that, the, apparent, inconsistency, did, not, detract, from, the, play, s, quality, in, 1887, denton, jacques, snider, argued, that, the, play, should, be, read, as, a, dialectic, either, between, understanding, and, imagination, or, between, prose, and, poetry, he, also, viewed, the, play, as, representing, three, phases, or, movements, the, first, is, the, real, world, of, the, play, which, represents, reason, the, second, is, the, fairy, world, an, ideal, world, which, represents, imagination, and, the, supernatural, the, third, is, their, representation, in, art, where, the, action, is, self, reflective, snider, viewed, titania, and, her, caprice, as, solely, to, blame, for, her, marital, strife, with, oberon, she, therefore, deserves, punishment, and, oberon, is, a, dutiful, husband, who, provides, her, with, one, for, failing, to, live, in, peace, with, oberon, and, her, kind, titania, is, sentenced, to, fall, in, love, with, a, human, and, this, human, unlike, oberon, is, a, horrid, brute, towards, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, georg, brandes, 1895, 6, and, frederick, s, boas, 1896, were, the, last, major, additions, to, a, midsummer, night, s, dream, criticism, brandes, approach, anticipates, later, psychological, readings, seeing, oberon, s, magic, as, symbolic, and, typifying, the, sorcery, of, the, erotic, imagination, brandes, felt, that, in, the, play, shakespeare, looks, inward, at, the, domain, of, the, unconscious, boas, eschews, the, play, as, ethical, treatise, or, psychological, study, and, instead, takes, a, more, historicist, and, literal, approach, to, boas, the, play, is, despite, its, fantastical, and, exotic, trappings, essentially, english, and, elizabethan, he, sees, theseus, as, a, tudor, noble, helena, a, mere, plot, device, to, concentrate, the, four, lovers, on, a, single, spot, and, the, pyramus, and, thisbe, play, within, the, play, a, parody, of, a, prominent, topos, of, contemporary, plays, summing, up, their, contributions, kehler, writes, this, is, recognizably, modern, criticism, the, 20th, century, brought, new, insights, into, the, play, in, 1961, elizabeth, sewell, argued, that, shakespeare, aligns, himself, not, with, the, aristocrats, of, the, play, but, with, bottom, and, the, artisans, it, is, their, task, to, produce, a, wedding, entertainment, precisely, the, purpose, of, the, writer, on, working, in, this, play, also, in, 1961, frank, kermode, wrote, on, the, themes, of, the, play, and, their, literary, sources, he, counted, among, them, fantasy, blind, love, and, divine, love, he, traced, these, themes, to, the, works, of, macrobius, apuleius, and, giordano, bruno, bottom, also, briefly, alludes, to, a, passage, from, the, first, epistle, to, the, corinthians, by, paul, the, apostle, dealing, with, divine, love, in, 1964, r, w, dent, argued, against, theories, that, the, exemplary, model, of, love, in, the, play, is, the, rational, love, of, theseus, and, hippolyta, he, argued, that, in, this, work, love, is, inexplicable, it, is, the, offspring, of, imagination, not, reason, however, the, exemplary, love, of, the, play, is, one, of, an, imagination, controlled, and, restrained, and, avoids, the, excesses, of, dotage, genuine, love, is, contrasted, with, the, unrequited, love, and, dotage, of, demetrius, for, hermia, and, with, the, supposed, love, and, dotage, of, titania, for, an, unworthy, object, dent, also, denied, the, rationality, and, wisdom, typically, attributed, to, theseus, he, reminded, his, readers, that, this, is, the, character, of, theseus, from, greek, mythology, a, creation, himself, of, antique, fable, theseus, views, on, art, are, far, from, rational, or, wise, he, cannot, tell, the, difference, between, an, actual, play, and, its, interlude, the, interlude, of, the, play, s, acting, troop, is, less, about, the, art, and, more, of, an, expression, of, the, mechanicals, distrust, of, their, own, audience, they, fear, the, audience, reactions, will, be, either, excessive, or, inadequate, and, say, so, on, stage, theseus, fails, to, get, the, message, also, in, 1964, jan, kott, offered, his, own, views, on, the, play, he, saw, the, main, themes, of, the, play, as, being, violence, and, unrepressed, animalistic, sexuality, both, lysander, and, demetrius, are, in, his, view, verbally, brutal, lovers, whose, love, interests, are, exchangeable, and, objectified, the, changeling, that, oberon, desires, is, his, new, sexual, toy, the, aristocrats, of, the, play, both, mortal, and, immortal, are, promiscuous, as, for, the, athenian, lovers, following, their, night, in, the, forest, they, are, ashamed, to, talk, about, it, because, that, night, liberated, them, from, themselves, and, social, norms, and, allowed, them, to, reveal, their, real, selves, kott, s, views, were, controversial, and, contemporary, critics, wrote, either, in, favour, of, or, against, his, ideas, but, few, ignored, them, in, 1967, john, a, allen, theorised, that, bottom, is, a, symbol, of, the, animalistic, aspect, of, humanity, he, also, thought, bottom, was, redeemed, through, the, maternal, tenderness, of, titania, which, allowed, him, to, understand, the, love, and, self, sacrifice, of, pyramus, and, thisbe, in, 1968, stephen, fender, offered, his, own, views, on, the, play, he, emphasised, the, terrifying, power, of, the, fairies, and, argued, that, they, control, the, play, s, events, they, are, the, most, powerful, figures, featured, not, theseus, as, often, thought, he, also, emphasised, the, ethically, ambivalent, characters, of, the, play, finally, fender, noted, a, layer, of, complexity, in, the, play, theseus, hippolyta, and, bottom, have, contradictory, reactions, to, the, events, of, the, night, and, each, has, partly, valid, reasons, for, their, reactions, implying, that, the, puzzles, offered, to, the, play, s, audience, can, have, no, singular, answer, or, meaning, in, 1969, michael, taylor, argued, that, previous, critics, offered, a, too, cheerful, view, of, what, the, play, depicts, he, emphasised, the, less, pleasant, aspects, of, the, otherwise, appealing, fairies, and, the, nastiness, of, the, mortal, demetrius, prior, to, his, enchantment, he, argued, that, the, overall, themes, are, the, often, painful, aspects, of, love, and, the, pettiness, of, people, which, here, include, the, fairies, in, 1970, r, a, zimbardo, viewed, the, play, as, full, of, symbols, the, moon, and, its, phases, alluded, to, in, the, play, in, his, view, stand, for, permanence, in, mutability, the, play, uses, the, principle, of, discordia, concors, in, several, of, its, key, scenes, theseus, and, hippolyta, represent, marriage, and, symbolically, the, reconciliation, of, the, natural, seasons, or, the, phases, of, time, hippolyta, s, story, arc, is, that, she, must, submit, to, theseus, and, become, a, matron, titania, has, to, give, up, her, motherly, obsession, with, the, changeling, boy, and, passes, through, a, symbolic, death, and, oberon, has, to, once, again, woo, and, win, his, wife, kehler, notes, that, zimbardo, took, for, granted, the, female, subordination, within, the, obligatory, marriage, social, views, that, were, already, challenged, in, the, 1960s, in, 1971, james, l, calderwood, offered, a, new, view, on, the, role, of, oberon, he, viewed, the, king, as, specialising, in, the, arts, of, illusion, oberon, in, his, view, is, the, interior, dramatist, of, the, play, orchestrating, events, he, is, responsible, for, the, play, s, happy, ending, when, he, influences, theseus, to, overrule, egeus, and, allow, the, lovers, to, marry, oberon, and, theseus, bring, harmony, out, of, discord, he, also, suggested, that, the, lovers, identities, which, are, blurred, and, lost, in, the, forest, recall, the, unstable, identities, of, the, actors, who, constantly, change, roles, in, fact, the, failure, of, the, artisans, play, is, based, on, their, chief, flaw, as, actors, they, can, not, lose, their, own, identities, to, even, temporarily, replace, them, with, those, of, their, fictional, roles, also, in, 1971, andrew, d, weiner, argued, that, the, play, s, actual, theme, is, unity, the, poet, s, imagination, creates, unity, by, giving, form, to, diverse, elements, and, the, writer, is, addressing, the, spectator, s, own, imagination, which, also, creates, and, perceives, unity, weiner, connected, this, unity, to, the, concept, of, uniformity, and, in, turn, viewed, this, as, shakespeare, s, allusion, to, the, eternal, truths, of, platonism, and, christianity, also, writing, in, 1971, hugh, m, richmond, offered, an, entirely, new, view, of, the, play, s, love, story, lines, he, argued, that, what, passes, for, love, in, this, play, is, actually, a, self, destructive, expression, of, passion, he, argued, that, the, play, s, significant, characters, are, all, affected, by, passion, and, by, a, sadomasochistic, type, of, sexuality, this, passion, prevents, the, lovers, from, genuinely, communicating, with, each, other, at, the, same, time, it, protects, them, from, the, disenchantment, with, the, love, interest, that, communication, inevitably, brings, the, exception, to, the, rule, is, bottom, who, is, chiefly, devoted, to, himself, his, own, egotism, protects, him, from, feeling, passion, for, anyone, else, richmond, also, noted, that, there, are, parallels, between, the, tale, of, pyramus, and, thisbe, featured, in, this, play, and, that, of, shakespeare, s, romeo, and, juliet, in, 1971, neil, taylor, argued, that, there, was, a, double, time, scheme, in, the, play, making, it, seem, to, last, a, minimum, of, four, nights, but, to, also, be, timeless, in, 1972, ralph, berry, argued, that, shakespeare, was, chiefly, concerned, with, epistemology, in, this, play, the, lovers, declare, illusion, to, be, reality, the, actors, declare, reality, to, be, illusion, the, play, ultimately, reconciles, the, seemingly, opposing, views, and, vindicates, imagination, also, in, 1972, thomas, mcfarland, argued, that, the, play, is, dominated, by, a, mood, of, happiness, and, that, it, is, one, of, the, happiest, literary, creations, ever, produced, the, mood, is, so, lovely, that, the, audience, never, feels, fear, or, worry, about, the, fate, of, the, characters, in, 1974, marjorie, garber, argued, that, metamorphosis, is, both, the, major, subject, of, the, play, and, the, model, of, its, structure, she, noted, that, in, this, play, the, entry, in, the, woods, is, a, dream, like, change, in, perception, a, change, which, affects, both, the, characters, and, the, audience, dreams, here, take, priority, over, reason, and, are, truer, than, the, reality, they, seek, to, interpret, and, transform, also, in, 1974, alexander, leggatt, offered, his, own, reading, of, the, play, he, was, certain, that, there, are, grimmer, elements, in, the, play, but, they, are, overlooked, because, the, audience, focuses, on, the, story, of, the, sympathetic, young, lovers, he, viewed, the, characters, as, separated, into, four, groups, which, interact, in, various, ways, among, the, four, the, fairies, stand, as, the, most, sophisticated, and, unconstrained, the, contrasts, between, the, interacting, groups, produce, the, play, s, comic, perspective, in, 1975, ronald, f, miller, expresses, his, view, that, the, play, is, a, study, in, the, epistemology, of, imagination, he, focused, on, the, role, of, the, fairies, who, have, a, mysterious, aura, of, evanescence, and, ambiguity, also, in, 1975, david, bevington, offered, his, own, reading, of, the, play, he, in, part, refuted, the, ideas, of, jan, kott, concerning, the, sexuality, of, oberon, and, the, fairies, he, pointed, that, oberon, may, be, bisexual, and, his, desire, for, the, changeling, boy, may, be, sexual, in, nature, as, kott, suggested, but, there, is, little, textual, evidence, to, support, this, as, the, writer, left, ambiguous, clues, concerning, the, idea, of, love, among, the, fairies, he, concluded, that, therefore, their, love, life, is, unknowable, and, incomprehensible, according, to, bevington, the, main, theme, of, the, play, is, the, conflict, between, sexual, desire, and, rational, restraint, an, essential, tension, reflected, throughout, the, play, it, is, the, tension, between, the, dark, and, benevolent, sides, of, love, which, are, reconciled, in, the, end, in, 1977, anne, paolucci, argued, that, the, play, lasts, five, days, in, 1979, m, e, lamb, suggested, that, the, play, may, have, borrowed, an, aspect, of, the, ancient, myth, of, theseus, the, athenian, s, entry, into, the, labyrinth, of, the, minotaur, the, woods, of, the, play, serve, as, a, metaphorical, labyrinth, and, for, elizabethans, the, woods, were, often, an, allegory, of, sexual, sin, the, lovers, in, the, woods, conquer, irrational, passion, and, find, their, way, back, bottom, with, his, animal, head, becomes, a, comical, version, of, the, minotaur, bottom, also, becomes, ariadne, s, thread, which, guides, the, lovers, in, having, the, new, minotaur, rescue, rather, than, threaten, the, lovers, the, classical, myth, is, comically, inverted, theseus, himself, is, the, bridegroom, of, the, play, who, has, left, the, labyrinth, and, promiscuity, behind, having, conquered, his, passion, the, artisans, may, stand, in, for, the, master, craftsman, of, the, myth, and, builder, of, the, labyrinth, daedalus, even, theseus, best, known, speech, in, the, play, which, connects, the, poet, with, the, lunatic, and, the, lover, may, be, another, metaphor, of, the, lover, it, is, a, challenge, for, the, poet, to, confront, the, irrationality, he, shares, with, lovers, and, lunatics, accepting, the, risks, of, entering, the, labyrinth, also, in, 1979, harold, f, brooks, agreed, that, the, main, theme, of, the, play, its, very, heart, is, desire, and, its, culmination, in, marriage, all, other, subjects, are, of, lesser, importance, including, that, of, imagination, and, that, of, appearance, and, reality, in, 1980, florence, falk, offered, a, view, of, the, play, based, on, theories, of, cultural, anthropology, she, argued, that, the, play, is, about, traditional, rites, of, passage, which, trigger, development, within, the, individual, and, society, theseus, has, detached, himself, from, imagination, and, rules, athens, harshly, the, lovers, flee, from, the, structure, of, his, society, to, the, communitas, of, the, woods, the, woods, serve, here, as, the, communitas, a, temporary, aggregate, for, persons, whose, asocial, desires, require, accommodation, to, preserve, the, health, of, society, this, is, the, rite, of, passage, where, the, asocial, can, be, contained, falk, identified, this, communitas, with, the, woods, with, the, unconscious, with, the, dream, space, she, argued, that, the, lovers, experience, release, into, self, knowledge, and, then, return, to, the, renewed, athens, this, is, societas, the, resolution, of, the, dialectic, between, the, dualism, of, communitas, and, structure, also, in, 1980, christian, critic, r, chris, hassel, jr, offered, a, christian, view, of, the, play, the, experience, of, the, lovers, and, that, of, bottom, as, expressed, in, his, awakening, speech, teach, them, a, new, humility, a, healthy, sense, of, folly, they, realise, that, there, are, things, that, are, true, despite, the, fact, that, they, can, not, be, seen, or, understood, they, just, learned, a, lesson, of, faith, hassel, also, thought, that, theseus, speech, on, the, lunatic, the, lover, and, the, poet, is, an, applause, to, imagination, but, it, is, also, a, laughing, rejection, of, futile, attempts, to, perceive, categorise, or, express, it, some, of, the, interpretations, of, the, play, have, been, based, on, psychology, and, its, diverse, theories, in, 1972, alex, aronson, argued, that, theseus, represents, the, conscious, mind, and, puck, represents, the, unconscious, mind, puck, in, this, view, is, a, guise, of, the, unconscious, as, a, trickster, while, remaining, subservient, to, oberon, aronson, thought, that, the, play, explores, unauthorised, desire, and, linked, it, to, the, concept, of, fertility, he, viewed, the, donkey, and, the, trees, as, fertility, symbols, the, lovers, sexual, desires, are, symbolised, in, their, forest, encounters, in, 1973, melvin, goldstein, argued, that, the, lovers, can, not, simply, return, to, athens, and, wed, first, they, have, to, pass, through, stages, of, madness, multiple, disguises, and, discover, their, authentic, sexual, selves, in, 1979, norman, n, holland, applied, psychoanalytic, literary, criticism, to, the, play, he, interpreted, the, dream, of, hermia, as, if, it, was, a, real, dream, in, his, view, the, dream, uncovers, the, phases, of, hermia, s, sexual, development, her, search, for, options, is, her, defence, mechanism, she, both, desires, lysander, and, wants, to, retain, her, virginity, in, 1981, mordecai, marcus, argued, for, a, new, meaning, of, eros, love, and, thanatos, death, in, this, play, in, his, view, shakespeare, suggests, that, love, requires, the, risk, of, death, love, achieves, force, and, direction, from, the, interweaving, of, the, life, impulse, with, the, deathward, release, of, sexual, tension, he, also, viewed, the, play, as, suggesting, that, the, healing, force, of, love, is, connected, to, the, acceptance, of, death, and, vice, versa, in, 1987, jan, lawson, hinely, argued, that, this, play, has, a, therapeutic, value, shakespeare, in, many, ways, explores, the, sexual, fears, of, the, characters, releases, them, and, transforms, them, and, the, happy, ending, is, the, reestablishment, of, social, harmony, patriarchy, itself, is, also, challenged, and, transformed, as, the, men, offer, their, women, a, loving, equality, one, founded, on, respect, and, trust, she, even, viewed, titania, s, loving, acceptance, of, the, donkey, headed, bottom, as, a, metaphor, for, basic, trust, this, trust, is, what, enables, the, warring, and, uncertain, lovers, to, achieve, their, sexual, maturity, in, 1988, allen, dunn, argued, that, the, play, is, an, exploration, of, the, characters, fears, and, desires, and, that, its, structure, is, based, on, a, series, of, sexual, clashes, in, 1991, barbara, freedman, argued, that, the, play, justifies, the, ideological, formation, of, absolute, monarchy, and, makes, visible, for, examination, the, maintenance, process, of, hegemonic, order, during, the, years, of, the, puritan, interregnum, when, the, theatres, were, closed, 1642, 1660, the, comic, subplot, of, bottom, and, his, compatriots, was, performed, as, a, droll, drolls, were, comical, playlets, often, adapted, from, the, subplots, of, shakespearean, and, other, plays, that, could, be, attached, to, the, acts, of, acrobats, and, jugglers, and, other, allowed, performances, thus, circumventing, the, ban, against, drama, when, the, theatres, re, opened, in, 1660, a, midsummer, night, s, dream, was, acted, in, adapted, form, like, many, other, shakespearean, plays, samuel, pepys, saw, it, on, 29, september, 1662, and, thought, it, the, most, insipid, ridiculous, play, that, ever, i, saw, after, the, jacobean, caroline, era, a, midsummer, night, s, dream, was, never, performed, in, its, entirety, until, the, 1840s, instead, it, was, heavily, adapted, in, forms, like, henry, purcell, s, musical, masque, play, the, fairy, queen, 1692, which, had, a, successful, run, at, the, dorset, garden, theatre, but, was, not, revived, richard, leveridge, turned, the, pyramus, and, thisbe, scenes, into, an, italian, opera, burlesque, acted, at, lincoln, s, inn, fields, in, 1716, john, frederick, lampe, elaborated, upon, leveridge, s, version, in, 1745, charles, johnson, had, used, the, pyramus, and, thisbe, material, in, the, finale, of, love, in, a, forest, his, 1723, adaptation, of, as, you, like, it, in, 1755, david, garrick, did, the, opposite, of, what, had, been, done, a, century, earlier, he, extracted, bottom, and, his, companions, and, acted, the, rest, in, an, adaptation, called, the, fairies, frederic, reynolds, produced, an, operatic, version, in, 1816, in, 1840, madame, vestris, at, covent, garden, returned, the, play, to, the, stage, with, a, relatively, full, text, adding, musical, sequences, and, balletic, dances, vestris, took, the, role, of, oberon, and, for, the, next, seventy, years, oberon, and, puck, would, always, be, played, by, women, after, the, success, of,
