art, of, central, asia, art, of, east, asia, art, of, south, asia, art, of, southeast, asia, art, of, europe, art, of, africa, art, of, the, americas, art, of, oceania, in, the, history, of, art, prehistoric, art, is, all, art, produced, in, preliterate, prehistorical, cultures, beginning, somewhere, in, very, late, geological, history, and, generally, continuing, until, that, culture, either, develops, writing, or, other, methods, of, record, keeping, or, makes, significant, contact, with, another, culture, that, has, and, that, makes, some, record, of, major, historical, events, at, this, point, ancient, art, begins, for, the, older, literate, cultures, the, end, date, for, what, is, covered, by, the, term, thus, varies, greatly, between, different, parts, of, the, world, the, earliest, human, artifacts, showing, evidence, of, workmanship, with, an, artistic, purpose, are, the, subject, of, some, debate, it, is, clear, that, such, workmanship, existed, 40, 000, years, ago, in, the, upper, paleolithic, era, although, it, is, quite, possible, that, it, began, earlier, in, september, 2018, scientists, reported, the, discovery, of, the, earliest, known, drawing, by, homo, sapiens, which, is, estimated, to, be, 73, 000, years, old, much, earlier, than, the, 43, 000, years, old, artifacts, understood, to, be, the, earliest, known, modern, human, drawings, found, previously, engraved, shells, created, by, homo, erectus, dating, as, far, back, as, 500, 000, years, ago, have, been, found, although, experts, disagree, on, whether, these, engravings, can, be, properly, classified, as, art, from, the, upper, paleolithic, through, to, the, mesolithic, cave, paintings, and, portable, art, such, as, figurines, and, beads, predominated, with, decorative, figured, workings, also, seen, on, some, utilitarian, objects, in, the, neolithic, evidence, of, early, pottery, appeared, as, did, sculpture, and, the, construction, of, megaliths, early, rock, art, also, first, appeared, during, this, period, the, advent, of, metalworking, in, the, bronze, age, brought, additional, media, available, for, use, in, making, art, an, increase, in, stylistic, diversity, and, the, creation, of, objects, that, did, not, have, any, obvious, function, other, than, art, it, also, saw, the, development, in, some, areas, of, artisans, a, class, of, people, specializing, in, the, production, of, art, as, well, as, early, writing, systems, by, the, iron, age, civilizations, with, writing, had, arisen, from, ancient, egypt, to, ancient, china, many, indigenous, peoples, from, around, the, world, continued, to, produce, artistic, works, distinctive, to, their, geographic, area, and, culture, until, exploration, and, commerce, brought, record, keeping, methods, to, them, some, cultures, notably, the, maya, civilization, independently, developed, writing, during, the, time, they, flourished, which, was, then, later, lost, these, cultures, may, be, classified, as, prehistoric, especially, if, their, writing, systems, have, not, been, deciphered, the, earliest, undisputed, art, originated, with, the, homo, sapiens, aurignacian, archaeological, culture, in, the, upper, paleolithic, however, there, is, some, evidence, that, the, preference, for, the, aesthetic, emerged, in, the, middle, paleolithic, from, 100, 000, to, 50, 000, years, ago, some, archaeologists, have, interpreted, certain, middle, paleolithic, artifacts, as, early, examples, of, artistic, expression, the, symmetry, of, artifacts, evidence, of, attention, to, the, detail, of, tool, shape, has, led, some, investigators, to, conceive, of, acheulean, hand, axes, and, especially, laurel, points, as, having, been, produced, with, a, degree, of, artistic, expression, similarly, a, zigzag, engraving, supposedly, made, with, a, shark, tooth, on, a, freshwater, pseudodon, shell, dub1006, fl, around, 500, 000, years, ago, i, e, well, into, the, lower, paleolithic, associated, with, homo, erectus, could, be, the, earliest, evidence, of, artistic, activity, but, the, actual, intent, behind, this, geometric, ornament, is, not, known, there, are, other, claims, of, middle, paleolithic, sculpture, dubbed, the, venus, of, tan, tan, before, 300, kya, and, the, venus, of, berekhat, ram, 250, kya, in, 2002, in, blombos, cave, situated, in, south, africa, stones, were, discovered, engraved, with, grid, or, cross, hatch, patterns, dated, to, some, 70, 000, years, ago, this, suggested, to, some, researchers, that, early, homo, sapiens, were, capable, of, abstraction, and, production, of, abstract, art, or, symbolic, art, several, archaeologists, including, richard, klein, are, hesitant, to, accept, the, blombos, caves, as, the, first, example, of, actual, art, in, september, 2018, the, discovery, in, south, africa, of, the, earliest, known, drawing, by, homo, sapiens, was, announced, which, is, estimated, to, be, 73, 000, years, old, much, earlier, than, the, 43, 000, years, old, artifacts, understood, to, be, the, earliest, known, modern, human, drawings, found, previously, the, drawing, shows, a, crosshatched, pattern, made, up, of, nine, fine, lines, the, sudden, termination, of, all, of, the, lines, on, the, fragment, edges, indicate, that, the, pattern, originally, extended, over, a, larger, surface, it, is, also, estimated, that, the, pattern, was, most, likely, more, complex, and, structured, in, its, entirety, than, shown, on, the, discovered, area, initially, when, this, drawing, was, found, there, was, much, debate, to, prove, that, this, drawing, was, created, by, homo, sapiens, french, team, members, who, specialized, in, chemical, analysis, of, pigments, reproduced, the, same, lines, using, a, variety, of, techniques, they, concluded, that, the, lines, making, up, the, drawing, were, intentional, and, were, most, likely, made, with, ocher, this, discovery, adds, further, dimensions, to, understanding, the, behavior, and, cognition, of, early, homo, sapiens, neanderthals, may, have, made, art, painted, designs, in, the, caves, of, la, pasiega, cantabria, a, hand, stencil, in, maltravieso, extremadura, and, red, painted, speleothems, in, ardales, andalusia, are, dated, to, 64, 800, years, ago, predating, by, at, least, 20, 000, years, the, arrival, of, modern, humans, in, europe, in, july, 2021, scientists, reported, the, discovery, of, a, bone, carving, one, of, the, world, s, oldest, works, of, art, made, by, neanderthals, about, 51, 000, years, ago, in, november, 2018, scientists, reported, the, discovery, of, the, oldest, known, figurative, art, painting, over, 40, 000, perhaps, as, old, as, 52, 000, years, old, of, an, unknown, animal, in, the, cave, of, lubang, jeriji, sal, h, on, the, indonesian, island, of, borneo, while, in, 2020, a, megaloceros, bone, was, found, in, the, harz, mountains, in, germany, on, which, specimens, of, homo, neanderthalensis, carved, ornaments, 51, 000, years, ago, the, oldest, undisputed, works, of, figurative, art, were, found, in, the, schw, bische, alb, baden, w, rttemberg, germany, the, earliest, of, these, the, venus, figurine, known, as, the, venus, of, hohle, fels, and, the, lion, man, figurine, date, to, some, 40, 000, years, ago, further, depictional, art, from, the, upper, palaeolithic, period, broadly, 40, 000, to, 10, 000, years, ago, includes, cave, painting, e, g, those, at, chauvet, altamira, pech, merle, arcy, sur, cure, and, lascaux, and, portable, art, venus, figurines, like,

paintings, in, pettakere, cave, on, the, indonesian, island, of, sulawesi, are, up, to, 40, 000, years, old, a, similar, date, to, the, oldest, european, cave, art, which, may, suggest, an, older, common, origin, for, this, type, of, art, perhaps, in, africa, monumental, open, air, art, in, europe, from, this, period, includes, the, rock, art, at, c, a, valley, and, mazouco, in, portugal, domingo, garc, a, and, siega, verde, in, spain, and, rocher, grav, de, fornols, in, france, a, cave, at, turobong, in, south, korea, containing, human, remains, has, been, found, to, contain, carved, deer, bones, and, depictions, of, deer, that, may, be, as, much, as, 40, 000, years, old, petroglyphs, of, deer, or, reindeer, found, at, sokchang, ri, may, also, date, to, the, upper, paleolithic, potsherds, in, a, style, reminiscent, of, early, japanese, work, have, been, found, at, kosan, ri, on, jeju, island, which, due, to, lower, sea, levels, at, the, time, would, have, been, accessible, from, japan, the, oldest, petroglyphs, are, dated, to, approximately, the, mesolithic, and, late, upper, paleolithic, boundary, about, 10, 000, to, 12, 000, years, ago, the, earliest, undisputed, african, rock, art, dates, back, about, 10, 000, years, the, first, naturalistic, paintings, of, humans, found, in, africa, date, back, about, 8, 000, years, apparently, originating, in, the, nile, river, valley, spread, as, far, west, as, mali, about, 10, 000, years, ago, noted, sites, containing, early, art, include, tassili, n, ajjer, in, southern, algeria, tadrart, acacus, in, libya, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, and, the, tibesti, mountains, in, northern, chad, rock, carvings, at, the, wonderwerk, cave, in, south, africa, have, been, dated, to, this, age, contentious, dates, as, far, back, as, 29, 000, years, have, been, obtained, at, a, site, in, tanzania, a, site, at, the, apollo, 11, cave, complex, in, namibia, has, been, dated, to, 27, 000, years, g, bekli, tepe, in,

abstract, enigmatic, pictograms, and, carved, animal, reliefs, asia, was, the, cradle, for, several, significant, civilizations, most, notably, those, of, china, and, south, asia, the, prehistory, of, eastern, asia, is, especially, interesting, as, the, relatively, early, introduction, of, writing, and, historical, record, keeping, in, china, has, a, notable, impact, on, the, immediately, surrounding, cultures, and, geographic, areas, little, of, the, very, rich, traditions, of, the, art, of, mesopotamia, counts, as, prehistoric, as, writing, was, introduced, so, early, there, but, neighbouring, cultures, such, as, urartu, luristan, and, persia, had, significant, and, complex, artistic, traditions, the, earliest, indian, paintings, were, the, rock, paintings, of, prehistoric, times, the, petroglyphs, as, found, in, places, like, the, rock, shelters, of, bhimbetka, and, some, of, them, are, dated, to, c, 8, 000, bc, the, indus, valley, civilization, produced, fine, small, stamp, seals, and, sculptures, and, may, have, been, literate, but, after, its, collapse, there, are, relatively, few, artistic, remains, until, the, literate, period, probably, as, perishable, materials, were, used, the, gobustan, national, park, reserve, located, at, the, south, east, of, the, greater, caucasus, mountains, in, azerbaijan, 60, km, away, from, baku, date, back, more, than,

to, viking, ships, gobustan, is, also, characterized, by, its, natural, musical, stone, called, gavaldash, tambourine, stone, prehistoric, artwork, such, as, painted, pottery, in, neolithic, china, can, be, traced, back, to, the, yangshao, culture, and, longshan, culture, of, the, yellow, river, valley, during, china, s, bronze, age, chinese, of, the, ancient, shang, dynasty, and, zhou, dynasty, produced, multitudes, of, chinese, ritual, bronzes, which, are, elaborate, versions, of, ordinary, vessels, and, other, objects, used, in, rituals, of, ancestor, veneration, decorated, with, taotie, motifs, and, by, the, late, shang, chinese, bronze, inscriptions, discoveries, in, 1987, in, sanxingdui, in, central, china, revealed, a, previously, unknown, pre, literate, bronze, age, culture, whose, artefacts, included, spectacular, very, large, bronze, figures, example, left, and, which, appeared, culturally, very, different, from, the, contemporary, late, shang, which, has, always, formed, part, of, the, account, of, the, continuous, tradition, of, chinese, culture, according, to, archeological, evidence, the, j, mon, people, in, ancient, japan, were, among, the, first, to, develop, pottery, dated, from, the, 11th, millennium, bce, with, growing, sophistication, the, j, mon, created, patterns, by, impressing, the, wet, clay, with, braided, or, unbraided, cord, and, sticks, the, earliest, examples, of, korean, art, consist, of, stone, age, works, dating, from, 3000, bce, these, mainly, consist, of, votive, sculptures, although, petroglyphs, have, also, been, recently, rediscovered, rock, arts, elaborate, stone, tools, and, potteries, were, also, prevalent, this, early, period, was, followed, by, the, art, styles, of, various, korean, kingdoms, and, dynasties, in, these, periods, artists, often, adopted, chinese, style, in, their, artworks, however, koreans, not, only, adopted, but, also, modified, chinese, culture, with, a, native, preference, for, simple, elegance, purity, of, nature, and, spontaneity, this, filtering, of, chinese, styles, later, influenced, japanese, artistic, traditions, due, to, cultural, and, geographical, circumstances, the, prehistory, of, korea, ends, with, the, founding, of, the, three, kingdoms, of, korea, which, are, documented, in, the, samguk, sagi, a, 12th, century, ce, text, written, in, classical, chinese, the, written, language, of, the, literati, in, traditional, korea, as, beginning, in, the, 1st, century, bce, some, mention, of, earlier, history, is, also, made, in, chinese, texts, like, the, 3rd, century, ce, sanguo, zhi, clearer, evidence, of, culture, emerges, in, the, late, neolithic, known, in, korea, as, the, jeulmun, pottery, period, with, pottery, similar, to, that, found, in, the, adjacent, regions, of, china, decorated, with, z, shaped, patterns, the, earliest, neolithic, sites, with, pottery, remains, for, example, osan, ri, date, to, 6000, 4500, bce, this, pottery, is, characterized, by, comb, patterning, with, the, pot, frequently, having, a, pointed, base, ornaments, from, this, time, include, masks, made, of, shell, with, notable, finds, at, tongsam, dong, osan, ri, and, sinam, ri, hand, shaped, clay, figurines, have, been, found, at, nongpo, dong, during, the, mumun, pottery, period, roughly, between, 1500, bce, and, 300, bce, agriculture, expanded, and, evidence, of, larger, scale, political, structures, became, apparent, as, villages, grew, and, some, burials, became, more, elaborate, megalithic, tombs, and, dolmens, throughout, korea, date, to, this, time, the, pottery, of, the, time, is, in, a, distinctive, undecorated, style, many, of, these, changes, in, style, may, have, occurred, due, to, immigration, of, new, peoples, from, the, north, although, this, is, a, subject, of, debate, at, a, number, of, sites, in, southern, korea, there, are, rock, art, panels, that, are, thought, to, date, from, this, period, mainly, for, stylistic, reasons, while, the, exact, date, of, the, introduction, of, bronzework, into, korea, is, also, a, matter, of, debate, it, is, clear, that, bronze, was, being, worked, by, about, 700, bce, finds, include, stylistically, distinctive, daggers, mirrors, and, belt, buckles, with, evidence, by, the, 1st, century, bce, of, a, widespread, locally, distinctive, bronzeworking, culture, the, time, between, 300, bce, and, the, founding, and, stabilization, of, the, three, kingdoms, around, 300, ce, is, characterized, artistically, and, archaeologically, by, increasing, trade, with, china, and, japan, something, that, chinese, histories, of, the, time, corroborate, the, expansionist, chinese, invaded, and, established, commanderies, in, northern, korea, as, early, as, the, 1st, century, bce, they, were, driven, out, by, the, 4th, century, ce, the, remains, of, some, of, these, especially, that, of, lelang, near, modern, pyongyang, have, yielded, many, artifacts, in, a, typical, han, style, chinese, histories, also, record, the, beginnings, of, iron, works, in, korea, in, the, 1st, century, bce, stoneware, and, kiln, fired, pottery, also, appears, to, date, from, this, time, although, there, is, controversy, over, the, dates, pottery, of, distinctly, japanese, origin, is, found, in, korea, and, metalwork, of, korean, origin, is, found, in, northeastern, china, superb, samples, of, steppes, art, mostly, golden, jewellery, and, trappings, for, horse, are, found, over, a, vast, expanses, of, land, stretching, from, hungary, to, mongolia, dating, from, the, period, between, the, 7th, and, 3rd, centuries, bce, the, objects, are, usually, diminutive, as, may, be, expected, from, nomadic, people, always, on, the, move, art, of, the, steppes, is, primarily, an, animal, art, i, e, combat, scenes, involving, several, animals, real, or, imaginary, or, single, animal, figures, such, as, golden, stags, predominate, the, best, known, of, the, various, peoples, involved, are, the, scythians, at, the, european, end, of, the, steppe, who, were, especially, likely, to, bury, gold, items, among, the, most, famous, finds, was, made, in, 1947, when, the, soviet, archaeologist, sergei, rudenko, discovered, a, royal, burial, at, pazyryk, altay, mountains, which, featured, among, many, other, important, objects, the, most, ancient, extant, pile, rug, probably, made, in, persia, unusually, for, prehistoric, burials, those, in, the, northern, parts, of, the, area, may, preserve, organic, materials, such, as, wood, and, textiles, that, normally, would, decay, steppes, people, both, gave, and, took, influences, from, neighbouring, cultures, from, europe, to, china, and, later, scythian, pieces, are, heavily, influenced, by, ancient, greek, style, and, probably, often, made, by, greeks, in, scythia, the, ain, sakhri, lovers, from, modern, israel, is, a, small, natufian, carving, in, calcite, from, about, 9, 000, bce, around, the, same, time, the, extraordinary, site, of, g, bekli, tepe, in, eastern, turkey, was, begun, during, the, first, phase, belonging, to, the, pre, pottery, neolithic, a, ppna,

surfaces, of, the, pillars, there, are, reliefs, of, animals, abstract, patterns, and, some, human, figures, by, convention, prehistory, in, the, near, east, is, taken, to, continue, until, the, rise, of, the, achaemenid, empire, in, the, 6th, century, bce, although, writing, existed, in, the, region, from, nearly, 2, 000, years, earlier, on, that, basis, the, very, rich, and, long, tradition, of, the, art, of, mesopotamia, as, well, as, assyrian, sculpture, hittite, art, and, many, other, traditions, such, as, the, luristan, bronzes, all, fall, under, prehistoric, art, even, if, covered, with,

been, suggested, including, depictions, of, the, local, valley, and, the, oldest, known, image, of, the, moon, many, of, these, monuments, were, megalithic, tombs, and, archaeologists, speculate, that, most, have, religious, significance, knowth, is, reputed, to, have, approximately, one, third, of, all, megalithic, art, in, western, europe, in, the, central, alps, the, camunni, made, some,

bordeaux, and, the, university, of, the, witwatersrand, together, reported, the, discovery, of, the, earliest, known, drawing, by, homo, sapiens, at, blombos, cave, south, africa, which, is, estimated, to, be, 73, 000, years, old, much, earlier, than, the, 43, 000, years, old, artifacts, understood, to, be, the, earliest, known, modern, human, drawings, found, previously, there, is, a, significant, body, of, rock, painting, in, the, region, around, matobo, national, park, of, zimbabwe, dating, from, as, early, as, 6000, bce, to, 500, ce, significant, san, rock, paintings, exist, in, the, waterberg, area, above, the, palala, river, and, around, drakensberg, in, south, africa, some, of, which, are, considered, to, derive, from, the, period, 8000, bce, these, images, are, very,

made, from, twisted, plant, fibers, the, initial, period, in, central, andean, cultures, lasted, roughly, from, 1800, bce, to, 900, bce, textiles, from, this, time, found, at, huaca, prieta, are, of, astonishing, complexity, including, images, such, as, crabs, whose, claws, transform, into, snakes, and, double, headed, birds, many, of, these, images, are, similar, to, optical, illusions, where, which, image, dominates, depends, in, part, on, which, the, viewer, chooses, to, see, other, portable, artwork, from, this, time, includes, decorated, mirrors, bone, and, shell, jewelry, and, unfired, clay, female, effigies, public, architecture, including, works, estimated, to, require, the, movement, of, more, than, 100, 000, tons, of, stone, are, to, be, found, at, sites, like, kotosh, el, para, so, peru, and, la, galgada, archaeological, site, kotosh, a, site, in, the, andean, highlands, is, especially, noted, as, the, site, of, the, temple, of, the, crossed, hands, in, which, there, are,

n, culture, the, chav, n, culture, dominated, the, central, andes, during, the, first, horizon, beginning, around, 900, bce, and, is, generally, divided, into, two, stages, the, first, running, until, about, 500, bce, represented, a, significant, cultural, unification, of, the, highland, and, coastal, cultures, of, the, time, imagery, in, all, manner, of, art, textiles, ceramics, jewelry, and, architectural, included, sometimes, fantastic, imagery, such, as, jaguars, snakes, and, human, animal, composites, much, of, it, seemingly, inspired, by, the, jungles, to, the, east, the, later, stage, of, the, chav, n, culture, is, primarily, represented, by, a, significant, architectural, expansion, of, the, chav, n, de, huantar, site, around, 500, bce, accompanied, by, a, set, of, stylistic, changes, this, expansion, included, among, other, changes, over, forty, large, stone, heads, whose, reconstructed, positions, represent, a, transformation, from, human, to, supernatural, animal, visages, much, of, the, other, art, at, the, complex, from, this, time, contains, such, supernatural, imagery, the, portable, art, associated, with, this, time, included, sophisticated, metalworking, including, alloying, of, metals, and, soldering, textiles, found, at, sites, like, karwa, clearly, depict, chav, n, cultural, influences, and, the, cupisnique, style, of, pottery, disseminated, by, the, chav, n, would, set, standards, all, across, the, region, for, later, cultures, the, vessel, pictured, at, the, top, of, this, article, while, from, the, later, moche, culture, is, representative, of, the, stirrup, spouted, vessels, of, the, chav, n, the, early, intermediate, period, lasted, from, about, 200, bce, to, 600, ce, late, in, the, first, horizon, the, chav, n, culture, began, to, decline, and, other, cultures, predominantly, in, the, coastal, areas, began, to, develop, the, earliest, of, these, was, the, paracas, culture, centered, on, the, paracas, peninsula, of, central, peru, active, from, 600, bce, to, 175, bce, their, early, work, clearly, shows, chav, n, influence, but, a, locally, distinctive, style, and, technique, developed, it, was, characterized, by, technical, and, time, consuming, detail, work, visually, colorful, and, a, profusion, visual, elements, distinctive, technical, differences, include, painting, on, clay, after, firing, and, embroidery, on, textiles, one, notable, find, is, a, mantle, that, was, clearly, used, for, training, purposes, it, shows, obvious, indications, of, experts, doing, some, of, the, weaving, interspersed, with, less, technically, proficient, trainee, work, the, nazca, culture, of, southern, peru, which, is, widely, known, for, the, enormous, figures, traced, on, the, ground, by, the, nazca, lines, in, southern, peru, shared, some, similarities, with, the, paracas, culture, but, techniques, and, scale, differed, the, nazca, painted, their, ceramics, with, slip, and, also, painted, their, textiles, nazca, ceramics, featured, a, wide, variety, of, subjects, from, the, mundane, to, the, fantastic, including, utilitarian, vessels, and, effigy, figures, the, nazca, also, excelled, at, goldsmithing, and, made, pan, pipes, from, clay, in, a, style, not, unlike, the, pipes, heard, in, music, of, the, andes, today, the, famous, nazca, lines, are, accompanied, by, temple, like, constructions, showing, no, sign, of, permanent, habitation, and, open, plazas, that, presumably, had, ritual, purposes, related, to, the, lines, the, lines, themselves, are, laid, out, on, a, sort, of, natural, blackboard, where, a, thin, layer, of, dark, stone, covers, lighter, stone, the, lines, were, thus, created, by, simply, removing, the, top, layer, where, desired, after, using, surveying, techniques, to, lay, out, the, design, in, the, north, of, peru, the, moche, culture, dominated, during, this, time, also, known, as, mochica, or, early, chim, this, warlike, culture, dominated, the, area, until, about, 500, ce, apparently, using, conquest, to, gain, access, to, critical, resources, along, the, desert, coast, arable, land, and, water, moche, art, is, again, notably, distinctive, expressive, and, dynamic, in, a, way, that, many, other, andean, cultures, were, not, knowledge, of, the, period, has, been, notably, expanded, by, finds, like, the, pristine, royal, tombs, at, sip, n, the, moche, very, obviously, absorbed, some, elements, of, the, chav, n, culture, but, also, absorbed, ideas, from, smaller, nearby, cultures, that, they, assimilated, such, as, the, recuay, culture, and, the, vic, s, they, made, fully, sculpted, ceramic, animal, figures, worked, gold, and, wove, textiles, the, art, often, featured, everyday, images, but, seemingly, always, with, a, ritual, intent, in, its, later, years, the, moche, came, under, the, influence, of, the, expanding, huari, empire, the, cerro, blanco, site, of, huaca, del, sol, appears, to, have, been, the, moche, capital, largely, destroyed, by, natural, events, around, 600, ce, it, was, further, damaged, by, spanish, conquistadors, searching, for, gold, and, continues, with, modern, looters, the, middle, horizon, lasted, from, 600, ce, to, 1000, ce, and, was, dominated, by, two, cultures, the, huari, and, the, tiwanaku, the, tiwanaku, also, spelled, tiahuanaco, culture, arose, near, lake, titicaca, on, the, modern, border, between, peru, and, bolivia, while, the, wari, culture, arose, in, the, southern, highlands, of, peru, both, cultures, appear, to, have, been, influenced, by, the, pukara, culture, which, was, active, during, the, early, intermediate, in, between, the, primary, centers, of, the, wari, and, tiwanaku, these, cultures, both, had, wide, ranging, influence, and, shared, some, common, features, in, their, portable, art, but, their, monumental, arts, were, somewhat, distinctive, the, monumental, art, of, the, tiwanaku, demonstrated, technical, prowess, in, stonework, including, fine, detailed, reliefs, and, monoliths, such, as, the, ponce, monolith, photo, to, the, left, and, the, sun, gate, both, in, the, main, tiwanaku, site, the, portable, art, featured, portrait, vessels, with, figured, heads, on, ceramic, vessels, as, well, as, natural, imagery, like, jaguars, and, raptors, a, full, range, of, materials, from, ceramics, to, textiles, to, wood, bone, and, shell, were, used, in, creative, endeavours, textiles, with, a, weave, of, 300, threads, per, inch, 80, threads, per, cm, have, been, found, at, tiwanaku, sites, the, wari, dominated, an, area, from, northern, to, central, peru, with, their, main, center, near, ayacucho, their, art, is, distinguished, from, the, tiwanaku, style, by, the, use, of, bolder, colors, and, patterns, notable, among, wari, finds, are, tapestry, garments, presumed, to, be, made, for, priests, or, rulers, to, wear, often, bearing, abstract, geometric, designs, of, significant, complexity, but, also, bearing, images, of, animals, and, figures, wari, ceramics, also, of, high, technical, quality, are, similar, in, many, ways, to, those, of, the, preceding, cultures, where, local, influences, from, fallen, cultures, like, the, moche, are, still, somewhat, evident, metalwork, while, rarely, found, due, to, its, desirability, by, looters, shows, elegant, simplicity, and, once, more, a, high, level, of, workmanship, following, the, decline, of, the, wari, and, tiwanaku, the, northern, and, central, coastal, areas, were, somewhat, dominated, by, the, chim, culture, which, included, notable, subcultures, like, the, lambayeque, or, sic, n, and, chancay, cultures, to, the, south, coastal, cultures, dominated, in, the, ica, region, and, there, was, a, significant, cultural, crossroads, at, pachacamac, near, lima, these, cultures, would, dominate, from, about, 1000, ce, until, the, 1460s, and, 1470s, as, the, inca, empire, began, to, take, shape, and, eventually, absorbed, the, geographically, smaller, nearby, cultures, chim, and, sic, n, cultures, the, chim, culture, in, particular, was, responsible, for, an, extremely, large, number, of, artworks, its, capital, city, chan, chan, appears, to, have, contained, building, that, appeared, to, function, as, museums, they, seem, to, have, been, used, for, displaying, and, preserving, artwork, much, of, the, artwork, from, chan, chan, in, particular, has, been, looted, some, by, the, spanish, after, the, spanish, conquest, the, art, from, this, time, at, times, displays, amazing, complexity, with, multimedia, works, that, require, artists, working, together, in, a, diversity, of, media, including, materials, believed, to, have, come, from, as, far, away, as, central, america, items, of, increasing, splendor, or, value, were, produced, apparently, as, the, society, became, increasing, stratified, at, the, same, the, quality, of, some, of, the, work, declined, as, demand, for, pieces, pushed, production, rates, up, and, values, down, the, sic, n, culture, flourished, from, 700, ce, to, about, 1400, ce, although, it, came, under, political, domination, of, the, chim, around, 1100, ce, at, which, time, many, of, its, artists, may, have, moved, to, chan, chan, there, was, significant, copperworking, by, the, sic, n, including, what, seems, to, be, a, sort, of, currency, based, on, copper, objects, that, look, like, axes, artwork, includes, burial, masks, beakers, and, metal, vessels, that, previous, cultures, traditionally, made, of, clay, the, metalwork, of, the, sic, n, was, particularly, sophisticated, with, innovations, including, repouss, and, shell, inlay, sheet, metal, was, also, often, used, to, cover, other, works, prominent, in, sic, n, iconography, is, the, sic, n, deity, which, appears, on, all, manner, of, work, from, the, portable, to, the, monumental, other, imagery, includes, geometric, and, wave, patterns, as, well, as, scenes, of, fishing, and, shell, diving,

was, uneven, ceramics, are, generally, black, on, white, and, often, suffer, from, flaws, like, poor, firing, and, drips, of, the, slip, used, for, color, however, fine, examples, exist, textiles, are, overall, of, a, higher, quality, including, the, use, of, painted, weaves, and, tapestry, techniques, and, were, produced, in, large, quantities, the, color, palette, of, the, chancay, was, not, overly, bold, golds, browns, white, and, scarlet, predominate, pachacamac, pachacamac, is, a, temple, site, south, of, lima, peru, that, was, an, important, pilgrimage, center, into, spanish, colonial, times, the, site, boasts, temple, constructions, from, several, periods, culminating, in, inca, constructions, that, are, still, in, relatively, good, condition, the, temples, were, painted, with, murals, depicting, plants, and, animals, the, main, temple, contained, a, carved, wooden, sculpture, akin, to, a, totem, pole, ica, culture, the, ica, region, which, had, been, dominated, by, the, nazca, was, fragmented, into, several, smaller, political, and, culture, groups, the, pottery, produced, in, this, region, was, of, the, highest, quality, at, the, time, and, its, aesthetics, would, be, adopted, by, the, inca, when, they, conquered, the, area, this, time, period, represents, the, era, in, which, the, culture, of, the, central, andes, is, almost, completely, dominated, by, the, inca, empire, which, began, its, expansion, in, 1438, it, lasted, until, the, spanish, conquest, in, 1533, the, inca, absorbed, much, technical, skill, from, the, cultures, they, conquered, and,
