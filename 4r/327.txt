by, mallets, like, the, glockenspiel, which, uses, metal, bars, the, xylophone, essentially, consists, of, a, set, of, tuned, wooden, keys, arranged, in, the, fashion, of, the, keyboard, of, a, piano, each, bar, is, an, idiophone, tuned, to, a, pitch, of, a, musical, scale, whether, pentatonic, or, heptatonic, in, the, case, of, many, african, and, asian, instruments, diatonic, in, many, western, children, s, instruments, or, chromatic, for, orchestral, use, the, term, xylophone, may, be, used, generally, to, include, all, such, instruments, such, as, the, marimba, balafon, and, even, the, semantron, however, in, the, orchestra, the, term, xylophone, refers, specifically, to, a, chromatic, instrument, of, somewhat, higher, pitch, range, and, drier, timbre, than, the, marimba, and, these, two, instruments, should, not, be, confused, a, person, who, plays, the, xylophone, is, known, as, a, xylophonist, or, simply, a, xylophone, player, the, term, is, also, popularly, used, to, refer, to, similar, instruments, of, the, lithophone, and, metallophone, types, for, example, the, pixiphone, and, many, similar, toys, described, by, the, makers, as, xylophones, have, bars, of, metal, rather, than, of, wood, and, so, are, in, organology, regarded, as, glockenspiels, rather, than, as, xylophones, the, modern, western, xylophone, has, bars, of, rosewood, padauk, cocobolo, or, various, synthetic, materials, such, as, fiberglass, or, fiberglass, reinforced, plastic, which, allows, a, louder, sound, some, can, be, as, small, a, range, as, 2, 1, 2, octaves, but, concert, xylophones, are, typically, 3, 1, 2, or, 4, octaves, like, the, glockenspiel, the, xylophone, is, a, transposing, instrument, its, parts, are, written, one, octave, below, the, sounding, notes, concert, xylophones, have, tube, resonators, below, the, bars, to, enhance, the, tone, and, sustain, frames, are, made, of, wood, or, cheap, steel, tubing, more, expensive, xylophones, feature, height, adjustment, and, more, stability, in, the, stand, in, other, music, cultures, some, versions, have, gourds, that, act, as, helmholtz, resonators, others, are, trough, xylophones, with, a, single, hollow, body, that, acts, as, a, resonator, for, all, the, bars, old, methods, consisted, of, arranging, the, bars, on, tied, bundles, of, straw, and, is, still, practiced, today, placing, the, bars, adjacent, to, each, other, in, a, ladder, like, layout, ancient, mallets, were, made, of, willow, wood, with, spoon, like, bowls, on, the, beaten, ends, xylophones, should, be, played, with, very, hard, rubber, polyball, or, acrylic, mallets, sometimes, medium, to, hard, rubber, mallets, very, hard, core, or, yarn, mallets, are, used, for, softer, effects, lighter, tones, can, be, created, on, xylophones, by, using, wooden, headed, mallets, made, from, rosewood, ebony, birch, or, other, hard, woods, the, instrument, has, obscure, ancient, origins, nettl, proposed, that, it, originated, in, southeast, asia, and, came, to, africa, c, ad, 500, when, a, group, of, malayo, polynesian, speaking, peoples, migrated, to, africa, and, compared, east, african, xylophone, orchestras, and, javanese, and, balinese, gamelan, orchestras, 18, 19, 100, this, was, more, recently, challenged, by, ethnomusicologist, and, linguist, roger, blench, who, posits, an, independent, origin, in, of, the, xylophone, in, africa, citing, among, the, evidence, for, local, invention, distinct, features, of, african, xylophones, and, the, greater, variety, of, xylophone, types, and, proto, xylophone, like, instruments, in, africa, the, earliest, evidence, of, a, true, xylophone, is, from, the, 9th, century, in, southeast, asia, while, a, similar, hanging, wood, instrument, a,
