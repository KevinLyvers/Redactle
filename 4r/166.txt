tartuffe, or, the, impostor, or, the, hypocrite, t, r, t, f, t, u, f, french, tartuffe, ou, l, imposteur, pronounced, first, performed, in, 1664, is, a, theatrical, comedy, by, moli, re, the, characters, of, tartuffe, elmire, and, orgon, are, considered, among, the, greatest, classical, theatre, roles, moli, re, performed, his, first, version, of, tartuffe, in, 1664, almost, immediately, following, its, performance, that, same, year, at, versailles, grand, f, tes, the, party, of, the, delights, of, the, enchanted, island, les, f, tes, des, plaisirs, de, l, ile, enchant, e, king, louis, xiv, suppressed, it, probably, under, the, influence, of, the, archbishop, of, paris, paul, philippe, hardouin, de, beaumont, de, p, r, fixe, the, king, s, confessor, and, former, tutor, while, the, king, had, little, personal, interest, in, suppressing, the, play, he, did, so, because, as, stated, in, the, official, account, of, the, f, te, although, it, was, found, to, be, extremely, diverting, the, king, recognized, so, much, conformity, between, those, that, a, true, devotion, leads, on, the, path, to, heaven, and, those, that, a, vain, ostentation, of, some, good, works, does, not, prevent, from, committing, some, bad, ones, that, his, extreme, delicacy, to, religious, matters, can, not, suffer, this, resemblance, of, vice, to, virtue, which, could, be, mistaken, for, each, other, although, one, does, not, doubt, the, good, intentions, of, the, author, even, so, he, forbids, it, in, public, and, deprived, himself, of, this, pleasure, in, order, not, to, allow, it, to, be, abused, by, others, less, capable, of, making, a, just, discernment, of, it, 76, as, a, result, of, moli, re, s, play, contemporary, french, and, english, both, use, the, word, tartuffe, to, designate, a, hypocrite, who, ostensibly, and, exaggeratedly, feigns, virtue, especially, religious, virtue, the, play, is, written, entirely, in, twelve, syllable, lines, alexandrines, of, rhyming, couplets, 1, 962, lines, total, orgon, s, family, is, up, in, arms, because, orgon, and, his, mother, have, fallen, under, the, influence, of, tartuffe, a, pious, fraud, and, a, vagrant, prior, to, orgon, s, help, tartuffe, pretends, to, be, pious, and, to, speak, with, divine, authority, and, orgon, and, his, mother, no, longer, take, any, action, without, first, consulting, him, tartuffe, s, antics, do, not, fool, the, rest, of, the, family, or, their, friends, they, detest, him, orgon, raises, the, stakes, when, he, announces, that, tartuffe, will, marry, orgon, s, daughter, mariane, who, is, already, engaged, to, val, re, mariane, becomes, very, upset, at, this, news, and, the, rest, of, the, family, realizes, how, deeply, tartuffe, has, embedded, himself, into, the, family, in, an, effort, to, show, orgon, how, awful, tartuffe, really, is, the, family, devises, a, scheme, to, trap, tartuffe, into, confessing, to, elmire, orgon, s, wife, his, desire, for, her, as, a, pious, man, and, a, guest, he, should, have, no, such, feelings, for, the, lady, of, the, house, and, the, family, hopes, that, after, such, a, confession, orgon, will, throw, tartuffe, out, of, the, house, indeed, tartuffe, does, try, to, seduce, elmire, but, their, interview, is, interrupted, when, orgon, s, son, damis, who, has, been, eavesdropping, is, no, longer, able, to, control, his, boiling, indignation, and, jumps, out, of, his, hiding, place, to, denounce, tartuffe, tartuffe, is, at, first, shocked, but, recovers, very, well, when, orgon, enters, the, room, and, damis, triumphantly, tells, him, what, happened, tartuffe, uses, reverse, psychology, and, accuses, himself, of, being, the, worst, sinner, oui, mon, fr, re, je, suis, un, m, chant, un, coupable, un, malheureux, p, cheur, tout, plein, d, iniquit, yes, my, brother, i, am, wicked, guilty, a, miserable, sinner, just, full, of, iniquity, orgon, is, convinced, that, damis, was, lying, and, banishes, him, from, the, house, tartuffe, even, convinces, orgon, to, order, that, to, teach, damis, a, lesson, tartuffe, should, be, around, elmire, more, than, ever, as, a, gift, to, tartuffe, and, further, punishment, to, damis, and, the, rest, of, his, family, orgon, signs, over, all, his, worldly, possessions, to, tartuffe, in, a, later, scene, elmire, challenges, orgon, to, be, witness, to, a, meeting, between, her, and, tartuffe, orgon, ever, easily, convinced, decides, to, hide, under, a, table, in, the, same, room, confident, that, elmire, is, wrong, he, overhears, elmire, resisting, tartuffe, s, very, forward, advances, when, tartuffe, has, incriminated, himself, definitively, and, is, dangerously, close, to, violating, elmire, orgon, comes, out, from, under, the, table, and, orders, tartuffe, out, of, his, house, the, wily, guest, means, to, stay, and, tartuffe, finally, shows, his, hand, it, turns, out, that, earlier, before, the, events, of, the, play, orgon, had, admitted, to, tartuffe, that, he, had, possession, of, a, box, of, incriminating, letters, written, by, a, friend, not, by, him, tartuffe, had, taken, charge, and, possession, of, this, box, and, now, tells, orgon, that, he, orgon, will, be, the, one, to, leave, tartuffe, takes, his, temporary, leave, orgon, s, family, tries, to, decide, what, to, do, very, soon, monsieur, loyal, shows, up, with, a, message, from, tartuffe, and, the, court, itself, they, must, exit, the, house, because, it, now, belongs, to, tartuffe, dorine, makes, fun, of, monsieur, loyal, s, name, mocking, his, fake, loyalty, even, madame, pernelle, who, had, refused, to, believe, any, ill, about, tartuffe, even, in, the, face, of, her, son, s, actually, witnessing, it, has, become, convinced, of, tartuffe, s, duplicity, no, sooner, does, monsieur, loyal, leave, than, val, re, rushes, in, with, the, news, that, tartuffe, has, denounced, orgon, for, aiding, and, assisting, a, traitor, by, keeping, the, incriminating, letters, and, that, orgon, is, about, to, be, arrested, before, orgon, can, flee, tartuffe, arrives, with, an, officer, but, to, his, surprise, the, officer, arrests, him, instead, the, officer, explains, that, the, enlightened, king, louis, xiv, who, is, not, mentioned, by, name, has, heard, of, the, injustices, happening, in, the, house, and, appalled, by, tartuffe, s, treachery, towards, orgon, has, ordered, tartuffe, s, arrest, instead, it, is, revealed, that, tartuffe, has, a, long, criminal, history, and, has, often, changed, his, name, to, avoid, being, caught, as, a, reward, for, orgon, s, previous, good, services, the, king, not, only, forgives, him, for, keeping, the, letters, but, also, invalidates, the, deed, that, gave, tartuffe, possession, of, orgon, s, house, and, possessions, the, entire, family, is, thankful, that, it, has, escaped, the, mortification, of, both, orgon, s, potential, disgrace, and, their, dispossession, the, drama, ends, well, and, orgon, announces, the, upcoming, wedding, of, val, re, and, mariane, the, surprise, twist, ending, in, which, everything, is, set, right, by, the, unexpected, benevolent, intervention, of, the, heretofore, unseen, king, is, considered, a, notable, modern, day, example, of, the, classical, theatrical, plot, device, deus, ex, machina, though, tartuffe, was, received, well, by, the, public, and, even, by, louis, xiv, it, immediately, sparked, conflict, amongst, many, different, groups, who, were, offended, by, the, play, s, portrayal, of, someone, who, was, outwardly, pious, but, fundamentally, mercenary, lecherous, and, deceitful, and, who, uses, their, profession, of, piety, to, prey, on, others, the, factions, opposed, to, moli, re, s, work, included, part, of, the, hierarchy, of, the, french, roman, catholic, church, members, of, upper, class, french, society, and, the, illegal, underground, organization, called, the, compagnie, du, saint, sacrement, tartuffe, s, popularity, was, cut, short, when, the, archbishop, of, paris, p, r, fixe, issued, an, edict, threatening, excommunication, for, anyone, who, watched, performed, in, or, read, the, play, moli, re, attempted, to, assuage, church, officials, by, rewriting, his, play, to, seem, more, secular, and, less, critical, of, religion, but, the, archbishop, and, other, leading, officials, would, not, budge, the, revised, second, version, of, the, play, was, called, l, imposteur, and, had, a, main, character, named, panulphe, instead, of, tartuffe, the, only, performance, of, which, occurred, in, the, palais, royal, theatre, on, 5, august, 1667, immediately, the, following, day, on, 6, august, as, the, king, was, away, from, paris, guillaume, de, lamoignon, first, president, of, the, paris, parlement, censored, public, performances, even, throughout, moli, re, s, conflict, with, the, church, louis, xiv, continued, to, support, the, playwright, it, is, possible, that, without, the, king, s, support, moli, re, might, have, been, excommunicated, although, public, performances, of, the, play, were, banned, private, performances, for, the, french, aristocracy, did, occur, in, 1669, after, moli, re, s, detractors, lost, much, of, their, influence, he, was, finally, allowed, to, perform, the, final, version, of, his, play, however, due, to, all, the, controversy, surrounding, tartuffe, moli, re, mostly, refrained, from, writing, such, incisive, plays, as, this, one, again, an, ally, of, moli, re, believed, by, robert, mcbride, to, be, fran, ois, de, la, mothe, le, vayer, but, a, hotly, debated, point, responded, to, criticism, of, tartuffe, in, 1667, with, a, lettre, sur, la, com, die, de, l, imposteur, the, anonymous, author, sought, to, defend, the, play, to, the, public, by, describing, the, plot, in, detail, and, then, rebutting, two, common, arguments, made, for, why, the, play, was, banned, the, first, being, that, theatrical, works, should, not, discuss, religion, at, all, the, second, being, that, tartuffe, s, actions, on, stage, followed, by, his, pious, speech, would, make, the, audience, think, that, they, were, to, act, as, tartuffe, did, this, section, of, letter, contradicts, the, latter, by, describing, how, tartuffe, s, actions, are, worthy, of, ridicule, in, essence, comic, and, therefore, by, no, means, an, endorsement, the, comic, is, the, outward, and, visible, form, that, nature, s, bounty, has, attached, to, everything, unreasonable, so, that, we, should, see, and, avoid, it, to, know, the, comic, we, must, know, the, rational, of, which, it, denotes, the, absence, and, we, must, see, wherein, the, rational, consists, incongruity, is, the, heart, of, the, comic, it, follows, that, all, lying, disguise, cheating, dissimulation, all, outward, show, different, from, the, reality, all, contradiction, in, fact, between, actions, that, proceed, from, a, single, source, all, this, is, in, essence, comic, centuries, later, when, the, satirical, anticlerical, magazine, la, calotte, started, publication, in, 1906, its, first, editorial, asserted, that, laughter, is, the, only, weapon, feared, by, the, soldiers, of, tartuffe, the, new, magazine, proposed, to, effectively, deploy, that, weapon, with, articles, and, cartoons, mercilessly, lampooning, the, catholic, church, and, its, clergy, the, original, version, of, the, play, was, in, three, acts, and, was, first, staged, on, 12, may, 1664, at, the, palace, of, versailles, cour, de, marbre, as, part, of, festivities, known, as, les, plaisirs, de, l, le, enchant, e, because, of, the, attacks, on, the, play, and, the, ban, that, was, placed, on, it, this, version, was, never, published, and, no, text, has, survived, giving, rise, to, much, speculation, as, to, whether, it, was, a, work, in, progress, or, a, finished, piece, many, writers, believe, it, consisted, of, the, first, three, acts, of, the, final, version, while, john, cairncross, has, proposed, that, acts, 1, 3, and, 4, were, performed, although, the, original, version, could, not, be, played, publicly, it, could, be, given, privately, and, it, was, seen, on, 25, september, 1664, in, villers, cotter, ts, for, louis, brother, philippe, i, duke, of, orl, ans, aka, monsieur, and, 29, november, 1664, at, the, ch, teau, du, raincy, for, the, veteran, of, the, fronde, armand, de, bourbon, prince, of, conti, the, second, version, l, imposteur, was, in, five, acts, and, performed, only, once, on, 5, august, 1667, in, the, th, tre, du, palais, royal, on, 11, august, before, any, additional, performances, the, archbishop, of, paris, p, r, fixe, banned, this, version, also, the, largely, final, revised, third, version, in, five, acts, under, the, title, tartuffe, ou, l, imposteur, appeared, on, 5, february, 1669, at, the, palais, royal, theatre, and, was, highly, successful, this, version, was, published, and, is, the, one, that, is, generally, performed, today, since, moli, re, s, time, tartuffe, has, stayed, on, the, repertoire, of, the, com, die, fran, aise, where, it, is, its, most, performed, play, the, russian, theatre, practitioner, constantin, stanislavski, was, working, on, a, production,
