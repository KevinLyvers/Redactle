icelanders, which, feature, viking, voyages, migration, to, iceland, and, feuds, between, icelandic, families, however, sagas, subject, matter, is, diverse, including, pre, christian, scandinavian, legends, saints, and, bishops, both, from, scandinavia, and, elsewhere, scandinavian, kings, and, contemporary, icelandic, politics, and, chivalric, romances, either, translated, from, continental, european, languages, or, composed, locally, sagas, originated, in, the, middle, ages, but, continued, to, be, composed, in, the, ensuing, centuries, whereas, the, dominant, language, of, history, writing, in, medieval, europe, was, latin, sagas, were, composed, in, the, vernacular, old, norse, and, its, later, descendants, primarily, icelandic, while, sagas, are, written, in, prose, they, share, some, similarities, with, epic, poetry, and, often, include, stanzas, or, whole, poems, in, alliterative, verse, embedded, in, the, text, the, main, meanings, of, the, old, norse, word, saga, plural, s, gur, are, what, is, said, utterance, oral, account, notification, and, the, sense, used, in, this, article, structured, narrative, story, about, somebody, it, is, cognate, with, the, english, words, say, and, saw, in, the, sense, a, saying, as, in, old, saw, and, the, german, sage, but, the, modern, english, term, saga, was, borrowed, directly, into, english, from, old, norse, by, scholars, in, the, eighteenth, century, to, refer, to, old, norse, prose, narratives, the, word, continues, to, be, used, in, this, sense, in, the, modern, scandinavian, languages, icelandic, saga, plural, s, gur, faroese, s, ga, plural, s, gur, norwegian, soge, plural, soger, danish, saga, plural, sagaer, and, swedish, saga, plural, sagor, it, usually, also, has, wider, meanings, such, as, history, tale, and, story, it, can, also, be, used, of, a, genre, of, novels, telling, stories, spanning, multiple, generations, or, to, refer, to, saga, inspired, fantasy, fiction, swedish, folksaga, means, folk, tale, or, fairy, tale, while, konstsaga, is, the, swedish, term, for, a, fairy, tale, by, a, known, author, such, as, hans, christian, andersen, in, swedish, historiography, the, term, sagokung, saga, king, is, intended, to, be, ambiguous, as, it, describes, the, semi, legendary, kings, of, sweden, who, are, known, only, from, unreliable, sources, norse, sagas, are, generally, classified, as, follows, kings, sagas, konungas, gur, are, of, the, lives, of, scandinavian, kings, they, were, composed, in, the, twelfth, to, fourteenth, centuries, a, pre, eminent, example, is, heimskringla, probably, compiled, and, composed, by, snorri, sturluson, these, sagas, frequently, quote, verse, invariably, occasional, and, praise, poetry, in, the, form, of, skaldic, verse, the, icelanders, sagas, slendingas, gur, sometimes, also, called, family, sagas, in, english, are, purportedly, and, sometimes, actually, stories, of, real, events, which, usually, take, place, from, around, the, settlement, of, iceland, in, the, 870s, to, the, generation, or, two, following, the, conversion, of, iceland, to, christianity, in, 1000, they, are, noted, for, frequently, exhibiting, a, realistic, style, 101, 105, 7, it, seems, that, stories, from, these, times, were, passed, on, in, oral, form, until, they, eventually, were, recorded, in, writing, as, slendingas, gur, whose, form, was, influenced, both, by, these, oral, stories, and, by, literary, models, in, both, old, norse, and, other, languages, 112, 14, the, majority, perhaps, two, thirds, of, the, medieval, corpus, seem, to, have, been, composed, in, the, thirteenth, century, with, the, remainder, in, the, fourteenth, and, fifteenth, centuries, 102, these, sagas, usually, span, multiple, generations, and, often, feature, everyday, people, e, g, bandamanna, saga, and, larger, than, life, characters, e, g, egils, saga, 107, 12, key, works, of, this, genre, have, been, viewed, in, modern, scholarship, as, the, highest, quality, saga, writing, while, primarily, set, in, iceland, the, sagas, follow, their, characters, adventures, abroad, for, example, in, other, nordic, countries, the, british, isles, northern, france, and, north, america, 101, some, well, known, examples, include, nj, ls, saga, laxd, la, saga, and, grettis, saga, the, material, of, the, short, tales, of, icelanders, ttir, or, slendinga, ttir, is, similar, to, slendinga, s, gur, in, shorter, form, often, preserved, as, episodes, about, icelanders, in, the, kings, sagas, like, kings, sagas, when, sagas, of, icelanders, quote, verse, as, they, often, do, it, is, almost, invariably, skaldic, verse, contemporary, sagas, samt, ars, gur, or, samt, mas, gur, are, set, in, twelfth, and, thirteenth, century, iceland, and, were, written, soon, after, the, events, they, describe, most, are, preserved, in, the, compilation, sturlunga, saga, from, around, 1270, 80, though, some, such, as, arons, saga, hj, rleifssonar, are, preserved, separately, the, verse, quoted, in, contemporary, sagas, is, skaldic, verse, according, to, historian, j, n, vi, ar, sigur, sson, scholars, generally, agree, that, the, contemporary, sagas, are, rather, reliable, sources, based, on, the, short, time, between, the, events, and, the, recording, of, the, sagas, normally, twenty, to, seventy, years, the, main, argument, for, this, view, on, the, reliability, of, these, sources, is, that, the, audience, would, have, noticed, if, the, saga, authors, were, slandering, and, not, faithfully, portraying, the, past, legendary, sagas, fornaldars, gur, blend, remote, history, set, on, the, continent, before, the, settlement, of, iceland, with, myth, or, legend, their, aim, is, usually, to, offer, a, lively, narrative, and, entertainment, they, often, portray, scandinavia, s, pagan, past, as, a, proud, and, heroic, history, some, legendary, sagas, quote, verse, particularly, v, lsunga, saga, and, hei, reks, saga, and, when, they, do, it, is, invariably, eddaic, verse, some, legendary, sagas, overlap, generically, with, the, next, category, chivalric, sagas, 191, chivalric, sagas, riddaras, gur, are, translations, of, latin, pseudo, historical, works, and, french, chansons, de, geste, as, well, as, icelandic, compositions, in, the, same, style, norse, translations, of, continental, romances, seem, to, have, begun, in, the, first, half, of, the, thirteenth, century, 375, icelandic, writers, seem, to, have, begun, producing, their, own, romances, in, the, late, thirteenth, century, with, production, peaking, in, the, fourteenth, century, and, continuing, into, the, nineteenth, while, often, translated, from, verse, sagas, in, this, genre, almost, never, quote, verse, and, when, they, do, it, is, often, unusual, in, form, for, example, jarlmanns, saga, ok, hermanns, contains, the, first, recorded, quotation, of, a, refrain, from, an, icelandic, dance, song, and, a, metrically, irregular, riddle, in, jalar, j, ns, saga, saints, sagas, heilagra, manna, s, gur, and, bishops, sagas, biskupa, s, gur, are, vernacular, icelandic, translations, and, compositions, to, a, greater, or, lesser, extent, influenced, by, saga, style, in, the, widespread, genres, of, hagiography, and, episcopal, biographies, the, genre, seems, to, have, begun, in, the, mid, twelfth, century, icelandic, sagas, are, based, on, oral, traditions, and, much, research, has, focused, on, what, is, real, and, what, is, fiction, within, each, tale, the, accuracy, of, the, sagas, is, often, hotly, disputed, most, of, the, medieval, manuscripts, which, are, the, earliest, surviving, witnesses, to, the, sagas, were, taken, to, denmark, and, sweden, in, the, seventeenth, century, but, later, returned, to, iceland, classical, sagas, were, composed, in, the, thirteenth, century, scholars, once, believed, that, these, sagas, were, transmitted, orally, from, generation, to, generation, until, scribes, wrote, them, down, in, the, thirteenth, century, however, most, scholars, now, believe, the, sagas, were, conscious, artistic, creations, based, on, both, oral, and, written, tradition, a, study, focusing, on, the, description, of, the, items, of, clothing, mentioned, in, the, sagas, concludes, that, the, authors, attempted, to, create, a, historic, feel, to, the, story, by, dressing, the, characters, in, what, was, at, the, time, thought, to, be, old, fashioned, clothing, however, this, clothing, is, not, contemporary, with, the, events, of, the, saga, as, it, is, a, closer, match, to, the, clothing, worn, in, the, 12th, century, it, was, only, recently, start, of, 20th, century, that, the, tales, of, the, voyages, to, north, america, modern, day, canada, were, authenticated, most, sagas, of, icelanders, take, place, in, the, period, 930, 1030, which, is, called, s, gu, ld, age, of, the, sagas, in, icelandic, history, the, sagas, of, kings, bishops, contemporary, sagas, have, their, own, time, frame, most, were, written, down, between, 1190, and, 1320, sometimes, existing, as, oral, traditions, long, before, others, are, pure, fiction, and, for, some, we, do, know, the, sources, the, author, of, king, sverrir, s, saga, had, met, the, king, and, used, him, as, a, source, while, sagas, are, generally, anonymous, a, distinctive, literary, movement, in, the, 14th, century, involves, sagas, mostly, on, religious, topics, with, identifiable, authors, and, a, distinctive, latinate, style, associated, with, iceland, s, northern, diocese, of, h, lar, this, movement, is, known, as, the, north, icelandic, benedictine, school, nor, lenski, benediktsk, linn, the, vast, majority, of, texts, referred, to, today, as, sagas, were, composed, in, iceland, one, exception, is, i, reks, saga, translated, composed, in, norway, another, is, hjalmars, och, hramers, saga, a, post, medieval, forgery, composed, in, sweden, while, the, term, saga, is, usually, associated, with, medieval, texts, sagas, particularly, in, the, legendary, and, chivalric, saga, genres, continued, to, be, composed, in, iceland, on, the, pattern, of, medieval, texts, into, the, nineteenth, century, 193, 94, icelanders, produced, a, high, volume, of, literature, relative, to, the, size, of, the, population, historians, have, proposed, various, theories, for, the, high, volume, of, saga, writing, early, nationalist, historians, argued, that, the, ethnic, characteristics, of, the, icelanders, were, conducive, to, a, literary, culture, but, these, types, of, explanations, have, fallen, out, of, favor, with, academics, in, modern, times, it, has, also, been, proposed, that, the, icelandic, settlers, were, so, prolific, at, writing, in, order, to, capture, their, settler, history, historian, gunnar, karlsson, does, not, find, that, explanation, reasonable, though, given, that, other, settler, communities, have, not, been, as, prolific, as, the, early, icelanders, were, pragmatic, explanations, were, once, also, favoured, it, has, been, argued, that, a, combination, of, readily, available, parchment, due, to, extensive, cattle, farming, and, the, necessity, of, culling, before, winter, and, long, winters, encouraged, icelanders, to, take, up, writing, more, recently, icelandic, saga, production, has, been, seen, as, motivated, more, by, social, and, political, factors, the, unique, nature, of, the, political, system, of, the, icelandic, commonwealth, created, incentives, for, aristocrats, to, produce, literature, offering, a, way, for, chieftains, to, create, and, maintain, social, differentiation, between, them, and, the, rest, of, the, population, gunnar, karlsson, and, jesse, byock, argued, that, the, icelanders, wrote, the, sagas, as, a, way, to, establish, commonly, agreed, norms, and, rules, in, the, decentralized, icelandic, commonwealth, by, documenting, past, feuds, while, iceland, s, peripheral, location, put, it, out, of, reach, of, the, continental, kings, of, europe, and, that, those, kings, could, therefore, not, ban, subversive, forms, of, literature, because, new, principalities, lacked, internal, cohesion, a, leader, typically, produced, sagas, to, create, or, enhance, amongst, his, subjects, or, followers, a, feeling, of, solidarity, and, common, identity, by, emphasizing, their, common, history, and, legends, leaders, from, old, and, established, principalities, did, not, produce, any, sagas, as, they, were, already, cohesive, political, units, later, late, thirteenth, and, fourteenth, century, saga, writing, was, motivated, by, the, desire, of, the, icelandic, aristocracy, to, maintain, or, reconnect, links, with, the, nordic, countries, by, tracing, the, ancestry, of, icelandic, aristocrats, to, well, known, kings, and, heroes, to, which, the, contemporary, nordic, kings, could, also, trace, their, origins, the, corpus, of, old, norse, sagas, is, gradually, being, edited, in, the, slenzk, fornrit, series, which, covers, all, the, slendingas, gur, and, a, growing, range, of, other, ones, where, available, the, slenzk, fornrit, edition, is, usually, the, standard, one, 117, the, standard, edition, of, most, of, the, chivalric, sagas, composed, in, iceland, is, by, agnete, loth, 192, a, list, intended, to, be, comprehensive, of, translations, of, icelandic, sagas, is, provided, by, the, national, library, of, iceland, s, bibliography, of, saga, translations, many, modern, artists, working, in, different, creative, fields, have, drawn, inspiration, from, the, sagas, among, some, well, known, writers, for, example, who, adapted, saga, narratives, in, their, works, are, poul, anderson, laurent, binet, margaret, elphinstone, friedrich, de, la, motte, fouqu, gunnar, gunnarsson, henrik, ibsen,
