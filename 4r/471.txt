anger, are, communicated, through, words, music, movement, and, technical, aspects, of, the, entertainment, as, an, integrated, whole, although, musical, theatre, overlaps, with, other, theatrical, forms, like, opera, and, dance, it, may, be, distinguished, by, the, equal, importance, given, to, the, music, as, compared, with, the, dialogue, movement, and, other, elements, since, the, early, 20th, century, musical, theatre, stage, works, have, generally, been, called, simply, musicals, although, music, has, been, a, part, of, dramatic, presentations, since, ancient, times, modern, western, musical, theatre, emerged, during, the, 19th, century, with, many, structural, elements, established, by, the, light, opera, works, of, jacques, offenbach, in, france, gilbert, and, sullivan, in, britain, and, the, works, of, harrigan, and, hart, in, america, these, were, followed, by, edwardian, musical, comedies, which, emerged, in, britain, and, the, musical, theatre, works, of, american, creators, like, george, m, cohan, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, the, princess, theatre, musicals, 1915, 1918, were, artistic, steps, forward, beyond, the, revues, and, other, frothy, entertainments, of, the, early, 20th, century, and, led, to, such, groundbreaking, works, as, show, boat, 1927, of, thee, i, sing, 1931, and, oklahoma, 1943, some, of, the, most, famous, musicals, through, the, decades, that, followed, include, my, fair, lady, 1956, the, fantasticks, 1960, hair, 1967, a, chorus, line, 1975, les, mis, rables, 1985, the, phantom, of, the, opera, 1986, rent, 1996, wicked, 2003, and, hamilton, 2015, musicals, are, performed, around, the, world, they, may, be, presented, in, large, venues, such, as, big, budget, broadway, or, west, end, productions, in, new, york, city, or, london, alternatively, musicals, may, be, staged, in, smaller, venues, such, as, off, broadway, off, off, broadway, regional, theatre, fringe, theatre, or, community, theatre, productions, or, on, tour, musicals, are, often, presented, by, amateur, and, school, groups, in, churches, schools, and, other, performance, spaces, in, addition, to, the, united, states, and, britain, there, are, vibrant, musical, theatre, scenes, in, continental, europe, asia, australasia, canada, and, latin, america, since, the, 20th, century, the, book, musical, has, been, defined, as, a, musical, play, where, songs, and, dances, are, fully, integrated, into, a, well, made, story, with, serious, dramatic, goals, and, which, is, able, to, evoke, genuine, emotions, other, than, laughter, the, three, main, components, of, a, book, musical, are, its, music, lyrics, and, book, the, book, or, script, of, a, musical, refers, to, the, story, character, development, and, dramatic, structure, including, the, spoken, dialogue, and, stage, directions, but, it, can, also, refer, to, the, dialogue, and, lyrics, together, which, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, libretto, italian, for, small, book, the, music, and, lyrics, together, form, the, score, of, a, musical, and, include, songs, incidental, music, and, musical, scenes, which, are, theatrical, sequence, set, to, music, often, combining, song, with, spoken, dialogue, the, interpretation, of, a, musical, is, the, responsibility, of, its, creative, team, which, includes, a, director, a, musical, director, usually, a, choreographer, and, sometimes, an, orchestrator, a, musical, s, production, is, also, creatively, characterized, by, technical, aspects, such, as, set, design, costumes, stage, properties, props, lighting, and, sound, the, creative, team, designs, and, interpretations, generally, change, from, the, original, production, to, succeeding, productions, some, production, elements, however, may, be, retained, from, the, original, production, for, example, bob, fosse, s, choreography, in, chicago, there, is, no, fixed, length, for, a, musical, while, it, can, range, from, a, short, one, act, entertainment, to, several, acts, and, several, hours, in, length, or, even, a, multi, evening, presentation, most, musicals, range, from, one, and, a, half, to, three, hours, musicals, are, usually, presented, in, two, acts, with, one, short, intermission, and, the, first, act, is, frequently, longer, than, the, second, the, first, act, generally, introduces, nearly, all, of, the, characters, and, most, of, the, music, and, often, ends, with, the, introduction, of, a, dramatic, conflict, or, plot, complication, while, the, second, act, may, introduce, a, few, new, songs, but, usually, contains, reprises, of, important, musical, themes, and, resolves, the, conflict, or, complication, a, book, musical, is, usually, built, around, four, to, six, main, theme, tunes, that, are, reprised, later, in, the, show, although, it, sometimes, consists, of, a, series, of, songs, not, directly, musically, related, spoken, dialogue, is, generally, interspersed, between, musical, numbers, although, sung, dialogue, or, recitative, may, be, used, especially, in, so, called, sung, through, musicals, such, as, jesus, christ, superstar, falsettos, les, mis, rables, evita, and, hamilton, several, shorter, musicals, on, broadway, and, in, the, west, end, in, the, 21st, century, have, been, presented, in, one, act, moments, of, greatest, dramatic, intensity, in, a, book, musical, are, often, performed, in, song, proverbially, when, the, emotion, becomes, too, strong, for, speech, you, sing, when, it, becomes, too, strong, for, song, you, dance, in, a, book, musical, a, song, is, ideally, crafted, to, suit, the, character, or, characters, and, their, situation, within, the, story, although, there, have, been, times, in, the, history, of, the, musical, e, g, from, the, 1890s, to, the, 1920s, when, this, integration, between, music, and, story, has, been, tenuous, as, the, new, york, times, critic, ben, brantley, described, the, ideal, of, song, in, theatre, when, reviewing, the, 2008, revival, of, gypsy, there, is, no, separation, at, all, between, song, and, character, which, is, what, happens, in, those, uncommon, moments, when, musicals, reach, upward, to, achieve, their, ideal, reasons, to, be, typically, many, fewer, words, are, sung, in, a, five, minute, song, than, are, spoken, in, a, five, minute, block, of, dialogue, therefore, there, is, less, time, to, develop, drama, in, a, musical, than, in, a, straight, play, of, equivalent, length, since, a, musical, usually, devotes, more, time, to, music, than, to, dialogue, within, the, compressed, nature, of, a, musical, the, writers, must, develop, the, characters, and, the, plot, the, material, presented, in, a, musical, may, be, original, or, it, may, be, adapted, from, novels, wicked, and, man, of, la, mancha, plays, hello, dolly, and, carousel, classic, legends, camelot, historical, events, evita, and, hamilton, or, films, the, producers, and, billy, elliot, on, the, other, hand, many, successful, musical, theatre, works, have, been, adapted, for, musical, films, such, as, west, side, story, my, fair, lady, the, sound, of, music, oliver, and, chicago, musical, theatre, is, closely, related, to, the, theatrical, form, of, opera, but, the, two, are, usually, distinguished, by, weighing, a, number, of, factors, first, musicals, generally, have, a, greater, focus, on, spoken, dialogue, some, musicals, however, are, entirely, accompanied, and, sung, through, while, some, operas, such, as, die, zauberfl, te, and, most, operettas, have, some, unaccompanied, dialogue, second, musicals, usually, include, more, dancing, as, an, essential, part, of, the, storytelling, particularly, by, the, principal, performers, as, well, as, the, chorus, third, musicals, often, use, various, genres, of, popular, music, or, at, least, popular, singing, and, musical, styles, finally, musicals, usually, avoid, certain, operatic, conventions, in, particular, a, musical, is, almost, always, performed, in, the, language, of, its, audience, musicals, produced, on, broadway, or, in, the, west, end, for, instance, are, invariably, sung, in, english, even, if, they, were, originally, written, in, another, language, while, an, opera, singer, is, primarily, a, singer, and, only, secondarily, an, actor, and, rarely, needs, to, dance, a, musical, theatre, performer, is, often, an, actor, first, but, must, also, be, a, singer, and, dancer, someone, who, is, equally, accomplished, at, all, three, is, referred, to, as, a, triple, threat, composers, of, music, for, musicals, often, consider, the, vocal, demands, of, roles, with, musical, theatre, performers, in, mind, today, large, theatres, that, stage, musicals, generally, use, microphones, and, amplification, of, the, actors, singing, voices, in, a, way, that, would, generally, be, disapproved, of, in, an, operatic, context, some, works, including, those, by, george, gershwin, leonard, bernstein, and, stephen, sondheim, have, been, made, into, both, musical, theatre, and, operatic, productions, similarly, some, older, operettas, or, light, operas, such, as, the, pirates, of, penzance, by, gilbert, and, sullivan, have, been, produced, in, modern, adaptations, that, treat, them, as, musicals, for, some, works, production, styles, are, almost, as, important, as, the, work, s, musical, or, dramatic, content, in, defining, into, which, art, form, the, piece, falls, sondheim, said, i, really, think, that, when, something, plays, broadway, it, s, a, musical, and, when, it, plays, in, an, opera, house, it, s, opera, that, s, it, it, s, the, terrain, the, countryside, the, expectations, of, the, audience, that, make, it, one, thing, or, another, there, remains, an, overlap, in, form, between, lighter, operatic, forms, and, more, musically, complex, or, ambitious, musicals, in, practice, it, is, often, difficult, to, distinguish, among, the, various, kinds, of, musical, theatre, including, musical, play, musical, comedy, operetta, and, light, opera, like, opera, the, singing, in, musical, theatre, is, generally, accompanied, by, an, instrumental, ensemble, called, a, pit, orchestra, located, in, a, lowered, area, in, front, of, the, stage, while, opera, typically, uses, a, conventional, symphony, orchestra, musicals, are, generally, orchestrated, for, ensembles, ranging, from, 27, players, down, to, only, a, few, players, rock, musicals, usually, employ, a, small, group, of, mostly, rock, instruments, and, some, musicals, may, call, for, only, a, piano, or, two, instruments, the, music, in, musicals, uses, a, range, of, styles, and, influences, including, operetta, classical, techniques, folk, music, jazz, local, or, historical, styles, are, appropriate, to, the, setting, musicals, may, begin, with, an, overture, played, by, the, orchestra, that, weav, together, excerpts, of, the, score, s, famous, melodies, there, are, various, eastern, traditions, of, theatre, that, include, music, such, as, chinese, opera, taiwanese, opera, japanese, noh, and, indian, musical, theatre, including, sanskrit, drama, indian, classical, dance, parsi, theatre, and, yakshagana, india, has, since, the, 20th, century, produced, numerous, musical, films, referred, to, as, bollywood, musicals, and, in, japan, a, series, of, 2, 5d, musicals, based, on, popular, anime, and, manga, comics, has, developed, in, recent, decades, shorter, or, simplified, junior, versions, of, many, musicals, are, available, for, schools, and, youth, groups, and, very, short, works, created, or, adapted, for, performance, by, children, are, sometimes, called, minimusicals, the, antecedents, of, musical, theatre, in, europe, can, be, traced, back, to, the, theatre, of, ancient, greece, where, music, and, dance, were, included, in, stage, comedies, and, tragedies, during, the, 5th, century, bce, the, music, from, the, ancient, forms, is, lost, however, and, they, had, little, influence, on, later, development, of, musical, theatre, in, the, 12th, and, 13th, centuries, religious, dramas, taught, the, liturgy, groups, of, actors, would, use, outdoor, pageant, wagons, stages, on, wheels, to, tell, each, part, of, the, story, poetic, forms, sometimes, alternated, with, the, prose, dialogues, and, liturgical, chants, gave, way, to, new, melodies, the, european, renaissance, saw, older, forms, evolve, into, two, antecedents, of, musical, theatre, commedia, dell, arte, where, raucous, clowns, improvised, familiar, stories, and, later, opera, buffa, in, england, elizabethan, and, jacobean, plays, frequently, included, music, and, short, musical, plays, began, to, be, included, in, an, evenings, dramatic, entertainments, court, masques, developed, during, the, tudor, period, that, involved, music, dancing, singing, and, acting, often, with, expensive, costumes, and, a, complex, stage, design, these, developed, into, sung, plays, that, are, recognizable, as, english, operas, the, first, usually, being, thought, of, as, the, siege, of, rhodes, 1656, in, france, meanwhile, moli, re, turned, several, of, his, farcical, comedies, into, musical, entertainments, with, songs, music, provided, by, jean, baptiste, lully, and, dance, in, the, late, 17th, century, these, influenced, a, brief, period, of, english, opera, by, composers, such, as, john, blow, and, henry, purcell, from, the, 18th, century, the, most, popular, forms, of, musical, theatre, in, britain, were, ballad, operas, like, john, gay, s, the, beggar, s, opera, that, included, lyrics, written, to, the, tunes, of, popular, songs, of, the, day, often, spoofing, opera, and, later, pantomime, which, developed, from, commedia, dell, arte, and, comic, opera, with, mostly, romantic, plot, lines, like, michael, balfe, s, the, bohemian, girl, 1845, meanwhile, on, the, continent, singspiel, com, die, en, vaudeville, op, ra, comique, zarzuela, and, other, forms, of, light, musical, entertainment, were, emerging, the, beggar, s, opera, was, the, first, recorded, long, running, play, of, any, kind, running, for, 62, successive, performances, in, 1728, it, would, take, almost, a, century, afterwards, before, any, play, broke, 100, performances, but, the, record, soon, reached, 150, in, the, late, 1820s, other, musical, theatre, forms, developed, in, england, by, the, 19th, century, such, as, music, hall, melodrama, and, burletta, which, were, popularized, partly, because, most, london, theatres, were, licensed, only, as, music, halls, and, not, allowed, to, present, plays, without, music, colonial, america, did, not, have, a, significant, theatre, presence, until, 1752, when, london, entrepreneur, william, hallam, sent, a, company, of, actors, to, the, colonies, managed, by, his, brother, lewis, in, new, york, in, the, summer, of, 1753, they, performed, ballad, operas, such, as, the, beggar, s, opera, and, ballad, farces, by, the, 1840s, p, t,

autobiographical, film, 8, became, maury, yeston, s, nine, at, the, end, of, the, decade, evita, and, sweeney, todd, were, precursors, of, the, darker, big, budget, musicals, of, the, 1980s, that, depended, on, dramatic, stories, sweeping, scores, and, spectacular, effects, at, the, same, time, old, fashioned, values, were, still, embraced, in, such, hits, as, annie, 42nd, street, my, one, and, only, and, popular, revivals, of, no, no, nanette, and, irene, although, many, film, versions, of, musicals, were, made, in, the, 1970s, few, were, critical, or, box, office, successes, with, the, notable, exceptions, of, fiddler, on, the, roof, cabaret, and, grease, the, 1980s, saw, the, influence, of, european, megamusicals, on, broadway, in, the, west, end, and, elsewhere, these, typically, feature, a, pop, influenced, score, large, casts, and, spectacular, sets, and, special, effects, a, falling, chandelier, in, the, phantom, of, the, opera, a, helicopter, landing, on, stage, in, miss, saigon, and, big, budgets, some, were, based, on, novels, or, other, works, of, literature, the, british, team, of, composer, andrew, lloyd, webber, and, producer, cameron, mackintosh, started, the, megamusical, phenomenon, with, their, 1981, musical, cats, based, on, the, poems, of, t, s, eliot, which, overtook, a, chorus, line, to, become, the, longest, running, broadway, show, lloyd, webber, followed, up, with, starlight, express, 1984, performed, on, roller, skates, the, phantom, of, the, opera, 1986, also, with, mackintosh, derived, from, the, novel, of, the, same, name, and, sunset, boulevard, 1993, from, the, 1950, film, of, the, same, name, phantom, would, surpass, cats, to, become, the, longest, running, show, in, broadway, history, a, record, it, still, holds, the, french, team, of, claude, michel, sch, nberg, and, alain, boublil, wrote, les, mis, rables, based, on, the, novel, of, the, same, name, whose, 1985, london, production, was, produced, by, mackintosh, and, became, and, still, is, the, longest, running, musical, in, west, end, and, broadway, history, the, team, produced, another, hit, with, miss, saigon, 1989, which, was, inspired, by, the, puccini, opera, madama, butterfly, the, megamusicals, huge, budgets, redefined, expectations, for, financial, success, on, broadway, and, in, the, west, end, in, earlier, years, it, was, possible, for, a, show, to, be, considered, a, hit, after, a, run, of, several, hundred, performances, but, with, multimillion, dollar, production, costs, a, show, must, run, for, years, simply, to, turn, a, profit, megamusicals, were, also, reproduced, in, productions, around, the, world, multiplying, their, profit, potential, while, expanding, the, global, audience, for, musical, theatre, in, the, 1990s, a, new, generation, of, theatrical, composers, emerged, including, jason, robert, brown, and, michael, john, lachiusa, who, began, with, productions, off, broadway, the, most, conspicuous, success, of, these, artists, was, jonathan, larson, s, show, rent, 1996, a, rock, musical, based, on, the, opera, la, boh, me, about, a, struggling, community, of, artists, in, manhattan, while, the, cost, of, tickets, to, broadway, and, west, end, musicals, was, escalating, beyond, the, budget, of, many, theatregoers, rent, was, marketed, to, increase, the, popularity, of, musicals, among, a, younger, audience, it, featured, a, young, cast, and, a, heavily, rock, influenced, score, the, musical, became, a, hit, its, young, fans, many, of, them, students, calling, themselves, rentheads, camped, out, at, the, nederlander, theatre, in, hopes, of, winning, the, lottery, for, 20, front, row, tickets, and, some, saw, the, show, dozens, of, times, other, shows, on, broadway, followed, rent, s, lead, by, offering, heavily, discounted, day, of, performance, or, standing, room, tickets, although, often, the, discounts, are, offered, only, to, students, the, 1990s, also, saw, the, influence, of, large, corporations, on, the, production, of, musicals, the, most, important, has, been, disney, theatrical, productions, which, began, adapting, some, of, disney, s, animated, film, musicals, for, the, stage, starting, with, beauty, and, the, beast, 1994, the, lion, king, 1997, and, aida, 2000, the, latter, two, with, music, by, elton, john, the, lion, king, is, the, highest, grossing, musical, in, broadway, history, the, who, s, tommy, 1993, a, theatrical, adaptation, of, the, rock, opera, tommy, achieved, a, healthy, run, of, 899, performances, but, was, criticized, for, sanitizing, the, story, and, musical, theatre, izing, the, rock, music, despite, the, growing, number, of, large, scale, musicals, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, a, number, of, lower, budget, smaller, scale, musicals, managed, to, find, critical, and, financial, success, such, as, falsettoland, little, shop, of, horrors, bat, boy, the, musical, and, blood, brothers, which, ran, for, 10, 013, performances, the, topics, of, these, pieces, vary, widely, and, the, music, ranges, from, rock, to, pop, but, they, often, are, produced, off, broadway, or, for, smaller, london, theatres, and, some, of, these, stagings, have, been, regarded, as, imaginative, and, innovative, in, the, new, century, familiarity, has, been, embraced, by, producers, and, investors, anxious, to, guarantee, that, they, recoup, their, considerable, investments, some, took, usually, modest, budget, chances, on, new, and, creative, material, such, as, urinetown, 2001, avenue, q, 2003, the, light, in, the, piazza, 2005, spring, awakening, 2006, in, the, heights, 2008, next, to, normal, 2009, american, idiot, 2010, and, the, book, of, mormon, 2011, hamilton, 2015, transformed, under, dramatized, american, history, into, an, unusual, hip, hop, inflected, hit, in, 2011, sondheim, argued, that, of, all, forms, of, contemporary, pop, music, rap, was, the, closest, to, traditional, musical, theatre, and, was, one, pathway, to, the, future, however, most, major, market, 21st, century, productions, have, taken, a, safe, route, with, revivals, of, familiar, fare, such, as, fiddler, on, the, roof, a, chorus, line, south, pacific, gypsy, hair, west, side, story, and, grease, or, with, adaptations, of, other, proven, material, such, as, literature, the, scarlet, pimpernel, wicked, and, fun, home, hoping, that, the, shows, would, have, a, built, in, audience, as, a, result, this, trend, is, especially, persistent, with, film, adaptations, including, the, producers, spamalot, hairspray, legally, blonde, the, color, purple, xanadu, billy, elliot, shrek, waitress, and, groundhog, day, some, critics, have, argued, that, the, reuse, of, film, plots, especially, those, from, disney, such, as, mary, poppins, and, the, little, mermaid, equate, the, broadway, and, west, end, musical, to, a, tourist, attraction, rather, than, a, creative, outlet, today, it, is, less, likely, that, a, sole, producer, such, as, david, merrick, or, cameron, mackintosh, backs, a, production, corporate, sponsors, dominate, broadway, and, often, alliances, are, formed, to, stage, musicals, which, require, an, investment, of, 10, million, or, more, in, 2002, the, credits, for, thoroughly, modern, millie, listed, ten, producers, and, among, those, names, were, entities, composed, of, several, individuals, typically, off, broadway, and, regional, theatres, tend, to, produce, smaller, and, therefore, less, expensive, musicals, and, development, of, new, musicals, has, increasingly, taken, place, outside, of, new, york, and, london, or, in, smaller, venues, for, example, spring, awakening, fun, home, and, hamilton, were, developed, off, broadway, before, being, launched, on, broadway, several, musicals, returned, to, the, spectacle, format, that, was, so, successful, in, the, 1980s, recalling, extravaganzas, that, have, been, presented, at, times, throughout, theatre, history, since, the, ancient, romans, staged, mock, sea, battles, examples, include, the, musical, adaptations, of, lord, of, the, rings, 2007, gone, with, the, wind, 2008, and, spider, man, turn, off, the, dark, 2011, these, musicals, involved, songwriters, with, little, theatrical, experience, and, the, expensive, productions, generally, lost, money, conversely, the, drowsy, chaperone, avenue, q, the, 25th, annual, putnam, county, spelling, bee, xanadu, and, fun, home, among, others, have, been, presented, in, smaller, scale, productions, mostly, uninterrupted, by, an, intermission, with, short, running, times, and, enjoyed, financial, success, in, 2013, time, magazine, reported, that, a, trend, off, broadway, has, been, immersive, theatre, citing, shows, such, as, natasha, pierre, the, great, comet, of, 1812, 2012, and, here, lies,

although, work, by, male, songwriters, continues, to, be, produced, more, often, another, trend, has, been, to, create, a, minimal, plot, to, fit, a, collection, of, songs, that, have, already, been,
