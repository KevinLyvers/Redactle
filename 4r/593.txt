animation, is, a, filmmaking, technique, by, which, still, images, are, manipulated, to, create, moving, images, in, traditional, animation, images, are, drawn, or, painted, by, hand, on, transparent, celluloid, sheets, cels, to, be, photographed, and, exhibited, on, film, animation, has, been, recognized, as, an, artistic, medium, specifically, within, the, entertainment, industry, many, animations, are, computer, animations, made, with, computer, generated, imagery, cgi, stop, motion, animation, in, particular, claymation, has, continued, to, exist, alongside, these, other, forms, animation, is, contrasted, with, live, action, film, although, the, two, do, not, exist, in, isolation, many, moviemakers, have, produced, films, that, are, a, hybrid, of, the, two, as, cgi, increasingly, approximates, photographic, imagery, filmmakers, can, easily, composite, 3d, animations, into, their, film, rather, than, using, practical, effects, for, showy, visual, effects, vfx, computer, animation, can, be, very, detailed, 3d, animation, while, 2d, computer, animation, which, may, have, the, look, of, traditional, animation, can, be, used, for, stylistic, reasons, low, bandwidth, or, faster, real, time, renderings, other, common, animation, methods, apply, a, stop, motion, technique, to, two, and, three, dimensional, objects, like, paper, cutouts, puppets, or, clay, figures, a, cartoon, is, an, animated, film, usually, short, featuring, an, exaggerated, visual, style, the, style, takes, inspiration, from, comic, strips, often, featuring, anthropomorphic, animals, superheroes, or, the, adventures, of, human, protagonists, especially, with, animals, that, form, a, natural, predator, prey, relationship, e, g, cats, and, mice, coyotes, and, birds, the, action, often, centers, on, violent, pratfalls, such, as, falls, collisions, and, explosions, that, would, be, lethal, in, real, life, the, illusion, of, animation, as, in, motion, pictures, in, general, has, traditionally, been, attributed, to, the, persistence, of, vision, and, later, to, the, phi, phenomenon, and, beta, movement, but, the, exact, neurological, causes, are, still, uncertain, the, illusion, of, motion, caused, by, a, rapid, succession, of, images, that, minimally, differ, from, each, other, with, unnoticeable, interruptions, is, a, stroboscopic, effect, while, animators, traditionally, used, to, draw, each, part, of, the, movements, and, changes, of, figures, on, transparent, cels, that, could, be, moved, over, a, separate, background, computer, animation, is, usually, based, on, programming, paths, between, key, frames, to, maneuver, digitally, created, figures, throughout, a, digitally, created, environment, analog, mechanical, animation, media, that, rely, on, the, rapid, display, of, sequential, images, include, the, ph, nakisticope, zoetrope, flip, book, praxinoscope, and, film, television, and, video, are, popular, electronic, animation, media, that, originally, were, analog, and, now, operate, digitally, for, display, on, computers, technology, such, as, the, animated, gif, and, flash, animation, were, developed, in, addition, to, short, films, feature, films, television, series, animated, gifs, and, other, media, dedicated, to, the, display, of, moving, images, animation, is, also, prevalent, in, video, games, motion, graphics, user, interfaces, and, visual, effects, the, physical, movement, of, image, parts, through, simple, mechanics, for, instance, moving, images, in, magic, lantern, shows, can, also, be, considered, animation, the, mechanical, manipulation, of, three, dimensional, puppets, and, objects, to, emulate, living, beings, has, a, very, long, history, in, automata, electronic, automata, were, popularized, by, disney, as, animatronics, the, word, animation, stems, from, the, latin, anim, ti, n, stem, of, anim, ti, meaning, a, bestowing, of, life, the, earlier, meaning, of, the, english, word, is, liveliness, and, has, been, in, use, much, longer, than, the, meaning, of, moving, image, medium, long, before, modern, animation, began, audiences, around, the, world, were, captivated, by, the, magic, of, moving, characters, for, centuries, master, artists, and, craftsmen, have, brought, puppets, automatons, shadow, puppets, and, fantastical, lanterns, to, life, inspiring, the, imagination, through, physically, manipulated, wonders, in, 1833, the, stroboscopic, disc, better, known, as, the, ph, nakisticope, introduced, the, principle, of, modern, animation, which, would, also, be, applied, in, the, zoetrope, introduced, in, 1866, the, flip, book, 1868, the, praxinoscope, 1877, and, film, when, cinematography, eventually, broke, through, in, the, 1890s, the, wonder, of, the, realistic, details, in, the, new, medium, was, seen, as, its, biggest, accomplishment, it, took, years, before, animation, found, its, way, to, the, cinemas, the, successful, short, the, haunted, hotel, 1907, by, j, stuart, blackton, popularized, stop, motion, and, reportedly, inspired, mile, cohl, to, create, fantasmagorie, 1908, regarded, as, the, oldest, known, example, of, a, complete, traditional, hand, drawn, animation, on, standard, cinematographic, film, other, great, artistic, and, very, influential, short, films, were, created, by, ladislas, starevich, with, his, puppet, animations, since, 1910, and, by, winsor, mccay, with, detailed, hand, drawn, animation, in, films, such, as, little, nemo, 1911, and, gertie, the, dinosaur, 1914, during, the, 1910s, the, production, of, animated, cartoons, became, an, industry, in, the, us, successful, producer, john, randolph, bray, and, animator, earl, hurd, patented, the, cel, animation, process, that, dominated, the, animation, industry, for, the, rest, of, the, century, felix, the, cat, who, debuted, in, 1919, became, the, first, fully, realized, animal, character, in, the, history, of, american, animation, in, 1928, steamboat, willie, featuring, mickey, mouse, and, minnie, mouse, popularized, film, with, synchronized, sound, and, put, walt, disney, s, studio, at, the, forefront, of, the, animation, industry, although, disney, animation, s, actual, output, relative, to, total, global, animation, output, has, always, been, very, small, the, studio, has, overwhelmingly, dominated, the, aesthetic, norms, of, animation, ever, since, the, enormous, success, of, mickey, mouse, is, seen, as, the, start, of, the, golden, age, of, american, animation, that, would, last, until, the, 1960s, the, united, states, dominated, the, world, market, of, animation, with, a, plethora, of, cel, animated, theatrical, shorts, several, studios, would, introduce, characters, that, would, become, very, popular, and, would, have, long, lasting, careers, including, walt, disney, productions, goofy, 1932, and, donald, duck, 1934, fleischer, studios, paramount, cartoon, studios, out, of, the, inkwell,

in, 1918, but, one, day, after, its, premiere, the, film, was, confiscated, by, the, government, after, working, on, it, for, three, years, lotte, reiniger, released, the, german, feature, length, silhouette, animation, die, abenteuer, des, prinzen, achmed, in, 1926, the, oldest, extant, animated, feature, in, 1937, walt, disney, studios, premiered, their, first, animated, feature, using, the, rotoscope, technique, invented, by, max, fleischer, in, 1915, snow, white, and, the, seven, dwarfs, still, one, of, the, highest, grossing, traditional, animation, features, as, of, may, 2020, the, fleischer, studios, followed, this, example, in, 1939, with, gulliver, s, travels, with, some, success, partly, due, to, foreign, markets, being, cut, off, by, the, second, world, war, disney, s, next, features, pinocchio, fantasia, both, 1940, fleischer, studios, second, animated, feature, mr, bug, goes, to, town, 1941, 1942, and, disney, s, feature, films, cinderella, 1950, alice, in, wonderland, 1951, and, lady, and, the, tramp, 1955, failed, at, the, box, office, for, decades, afterward, disney, would, be, the, only, american, studio, to, regularly, produce, animated, features, until, ralph, bakshi, became, the, first, to, also, release, more, than, a, handful, features, sullivan, bluth, studios, began, to, regularly, produce, animated, features, starting, with, an, american, tail, in, 1986, although, relatively, few, titles, became, as, successful, as, disney, s, features, other, countries, developed, their, own, animation, industries, that, produced, both, short, and, feature, theatrical, animations, in, a, wide, variety, of, styles, relatively, often, including, stop, motion, and, cutout, animation, techniques, soviet, soyuzmultfilm, animation, studio, founded, in, 1936, produced, 20, films, including, shorts, per, year, on, average, and, reached, 1, 582, titles, in, 2018, china, czechoslovakia, czech, republic, italy, france, and, belgium, were, other, countries, that, more, than, occasionally, released, feature, films, while, japan, became, a, true, powerhouse, of, animation, production, with, its, own, recognizable, and, influential, anime, style, of, effective, limited, animation, animation, became, very, popular, on, television, since, the, 1950s, when, television, sets, started, to, become, common, in, most, developed, countries, cartoons, were, mainly, programmed, for, children, on, convenient, time, slots, and, especially, us, youth, spent, many, hours, watching, saturday, morning, cartoons, many, classic, cartoons, found, a, new, life, on, the, small, screen, and, by, the, end, of, the, 1950s, the, production, of, new, animated, cartoons, started, to, shift, from, theatrical, releases, to, tv, series, hanna, barbera, productions, was, especially, prolific, and, had, huge, hit, series, such, as, the, flintstones, 1960, 1966, the, first, prime, time, animated, series, scooby, doo, since, 1969, and, belgian, co, production, the, smurfs, 1981, 1989, the, constraints, of, american, television, programming, and, the, demand, for, an, enormous, quantity, resulted, in, cheaper, and, quicker, limited, animation, methods, and, much, more, formulaic, scripts, quality, dwindled, until, more, daring, animation, surfaced, in, the, late, 1980s, and, in, the, early, 1990s, with, hit, series, the, first, cartoon, of, the, simpsons, 1987, which, later, developed, into, its, own, show, in, 1989, and, spongebob, squarepants, since, 1999, as, part, of, a, renaissance, of, american, animation, while, us, animated, series, also, spawned, successes, internationally, many, other, countries, produced, their, own, child, oriented, programming, relatively, often, preferring, stop, motion, and, puppetry, over, cel, animation, japanese, anime, tv, series, became, very, successful, internationally, since, the, 1960s, and, european, producers, looking, for, affordable, cel, animators, relatively, often, started, co, productions, with, japanese, studios, resulting, in, hit, series, such, as, barbapapa, the, netherlands, japan, france, 1973, 1977, wickie, und, die, starken, m, nner, vicky, the, viking, austria, germany, japan, 1974, maya, the, bee, japan, germany, 1975, and, the, jungle, book, italy, japan, 1989, computer, animation, was, gradually, developed, since, the, 1940s, 3d, wireframe, animation, started, popping, up, in, the, mainstream, in, the, 1970s, with, an, early, short, appearance, in, the, sci, fi, thriller, futureworld, 1976, the, rescuers, down, under, was, the, first, feature, film, to, be, completely, created, digitally, without, a, camera, it, was, produced, using, the, computer, animation, production, system, caps, developed, by, pixar, in, collaboration, with, the, walt, disney, company, in, the, late, 1980s, in, a, style, similar, to, traditional, cel, animation, the, so, called, 3d, style, more, often, associated, with, computer, animation, became, the, dominant, technique, following, the, success, of, pixar, s, toy, story, 1995, the, first, computer, animated, feature, in, this, style, most, of, the, cel, animation, studios, switched, to, producing, mostly, computer, animated, films, around, the, 1990s, as, it, proved, cheaper, and, more, profitable, not, only, the, very, popular, 3d, animation, style, was, generated, with, computers, but, also, most, of, the, films, and, series, with, a, more, traditional, hand, crafted, appearance, in, which, the, charming, characteristics, of, cel, animation, could, be, emulated, with, software, while, new, digital, tools, helped, developing, new, styles, and, effects, in, 2010, the, animation, market, was, estimated, to, be, worth, circa, us, 80, billion, by, 2020, the, value, had, increased, to, an, estimated, us, 270, billion, animated, feature, length, films, returned, the, highest, gross, margins, around, 52, of, all, film, genres, between, 2004, and, 2013, animation, as, an, art, and, industry, continues, to, thrive, as, of, the, early, 2020s, the, clarity, of, animation, makes, it, a, powerful, tool, for, instruction, while, its, total, malleability, also, allows, exaggeration, that, can, be, employed, to, convey, strong, emotions, and, to, thwart, reality, it, has, therefore, been, widely, used, for, other, purposes, than, mere, entertainment, during, world, war, ii, animation, was, widely, exploited, for, propaganda, many, american, studios, including, warner, bros, and, disney, lent, their, talents, and, their, cartoon, characters, to, convey, to, the, public, certain, war, values, some, countries, including, china, japan, and, the, united, kingdom, produced, their, first, feature, length, animation, for, their, war, efforts, animation, has, been, very, popular, in, television, commercials, both, due, to, its, graphic, appeal, and, the, humour, it, can, provide, some, animated, characters, in, commercials, have, survived, for, decades, such, as, snap, crackle, and, pop, in, advertisements, for, kellogg, s, cereals, tex, avery, was, the, producer, of, the, first, raid, kills, bugs, dead, commercials, in, 1966, which, were, very, successful, for, the, company, apart, from, their, success, in, movie, theaters, and, television, series, many, cartoon, characters, would, also, prove, lucrative, when, licensed, for, all, kinds, of, merchandise, and, for, other, media, animation, has, traditionally, been, very, closely, related, to, comic, books, while, many, comic, book, characters, found, their, way, to, the, screen, which, is, often, the, case, in, japan, where, many, manga, are, adapted, into, anime, original, animated, characters, also, commonly, appear, in, comic, books, and, magazines, somewhat, similarly, characters, and, plots, for, video, games, an, interactive, form, of, animation, that, became, its, own, medium, have, been, derived, from, films, and, vice, versa, some, of, the, original, content, produced, for, the, screen, can, be, used, and, marketed, in, other, media, stories, and, images, can, easily, be, adapted, into, children, s, books, and, other, printed, media, songs, and, music, have, appeared, on, records, and, as, streaming, media, while, very, many, animation, companies, commercially, exploit, their, creations, outside, moving, image, media, the, walt, disney, company, is, the, best, known, and, most, extreme, example, since, first, being, licensed, for, a, children, s, writing, tablet, in, 1929, their, mickey, mouse, mascot, has, been, depicted, on, an, enormous, amount, of, products, as, have, many, other, disney, characters, this, may, have, influenced, some, pejorative, use, of, mickey, s, name, but, licensed, disney, products, sell, well, and, the, so, called, disneyana, has, many, avid, collectors, and, even, a, dedicated, disneyana, fan, club, since, 1984, disneyland, opened, in, 1955, and, features, many, attractions, that, were, based, on, disney, s, cartoon, characters, its, enormous, success, spawned, several, other, disney, theme, parks, and, resorts, disney, s, earnings, from, the, theme, parks, have, relatively, often, been, higher, than, those, from, their, movies, as, with, any, other, form, of, media, animation, has, instituted, awards, for, excellence, in, the, field, many, are, part, of, general, or, regional, film, award, programs, like, the, china, s, golden, rooster, award, for, best, animation, since, 1981, awards, programs, dedicated, to, animation, with, many, categories, include, asifa, hollywood, s, annie, awards, the, emile, awards, in, europe, and, the, anima, mundi, awards, in, brazil, apart, from, academy, awards, for, best, animated, short, film, since, 1932, and, best, animated, feature, since, 2002, animated, movies, have, been, nominated, and, rewarded, in, other, categories, relatively, often, for, best, original, song, and, best, original, score, beauty, and, the, beast, was, the, first, animated, film, nominated, for, best, picture, in, 1991, up, 2009, and, toy, story, 3, 2010, also, received, best, picture, nominations, after, the, academy, expanded, the, number, of, nominees, from, five, to, ten, the, creation, of, non, trivial, animation, works, i, e, longer, than, a, few, seconds, has, developed, as, a, form, of, filmmaking, with, certain, unique, aspects, traits, common, to, both, live, action, and, animated, feature, length, films, are, labor, intensity, and, high, production, costs, the, most, important, difference, is, that, once, a, film, is, in, the, production, phase, the, marginal, cost, of, one, more, shot, is, higher, for, animated, films, than, live, action, films, it, is, relatively, easy, for, a, director, to, ask, for, one, more, take, during, principal, photography, of, a, live, action, film, but, every, take, on, an, animated, film, must, be, manually, rendered, by, animators, although, the, task, of, rendering, slightly, different, takes, has, been, made, less, tedious, by, modern, computer, animation, it, is, pointless, for, a, studio, to, pay, the, salaries, of, dozens, of, animators, to, spend, weeks, creating, a, visually, dazzling, five, minute, scene, if, that, scene, fails, to, effectively, advance, the, plot, of, the, film, thus, animation, studios, starting, with, disney, began, the, practice, in, the, 1930s, of, maintaining, story, departments, where, storyboard, artists, develop, every, single, scene, through, storyboards, then, handing, the, film, over, to, the, animators, only, after, the, production, team, is, satisfied, that, all, the, scenes, make, sense, as, a, whole, while, live, action, films, are, now, also, storyboarded, they, enjoy, more, latitude, to, depart, from, storyboards, i, e, real, time, improvisation, another, problem, unique, to, animation, is, the, requirement, to, maintain, a, film, s, consistency, from, start, to, finish, even, as, films, have, grown, longer, and, teams, have, grown, larger, animators, like, all, artists, necessarily, have, individual, styles, but, must, subordinate, their, individuality, in, a, consistent, way, to, whatever, style, is, employed, on, a, particular, film, since, the, early, 1980s, teams, of, about, 500, to, 600, people, of, whom, 50, to, 70, are, animators, typically, have, created, feature, length, animated, films, it, is, relatively, easy, for, two, or, three, artists, to, match, their, styles, synchronizing, those, of, dozens, of, artists, is, more, difficult, this, problem, is, usually, solved, by, having, a, separate, group, of, visual, development, artists, develop, an, overall, look, and, palette, for, each, film, before, the, animation, begins, character, designers, on, the, visual, development, team, draw, model, sheets, to, show, how, each, character, should, look, like, with, different, facial, expressions, posed, in, different, positions, and, viewed, from, different, angles, on, traditionally, animated, projects, maquettes, were, often, sculpted, to, further, help, the, animators, see, how, characters, would, look, from, different, angles, unlike, live, action, films, animated, films, were, traditionally, developed, beyond, the, synopsis, stage, through, the, storyboard, format, the, storyboard, artists, would, then, receive, credit, for, writing, the, film, in, the, early, 1960s, animation, studios, began, hiring, professional, screenwriters, to, write, screenplays, while, also, continuing, to, use, story, departments, and, screenplays, had, become, commonplace, for, animated, films, by, the, late, 1980s, traditional, animation, also, called, cel, animation, or, hand, drawn, animation, was, the, process, used, for, most, animated, films, of, the, 20th, century, the, individual, frames, of, a, traditionally, animated, film, are, photographs, of, drawings, first, drawn, on, paper, to, create, the, illusion, of, movement, each, drawing, differs, slightly, from, the, one, before, it, the, animators, drawings, are, traced, or, photocopied, onto, transparent, acetate, sheets, called, cels, which, are, filled, in, with, paints, in, assigned, colors, or, tones, on, the, side, opposite, the, line, drawings, the, completed, character, cels, are, photographed, one, by, one, against, a, painted, background, by, a, rostrum, camera, onto, motion, picture, film, the, traditional, cel, animation, process, became, obsolete, by, the, beginning, of, the, 21st, century, today, animators, drawings, and, the, backgrounds, are, either, scanned, into, or, drawn, directly, into, a, computer, system, various, software, programs, are, used, to, color, the, drawings, and, simulate, camera, movement, and, effects, the, final, animated, piece, is, output, to, one, of, several, delivery, media, including, traditional, 35, mm, film, and, newer, media, with, digital, video, the, look, of, traditional, cel, animation, is, still, preserved, and, the, character, animators, work, has, remained, essentially, the, same, over, the, past, 90, years, some, animation, producers, have, used, the, term, tradigital, a, play, on, the, words, traditional, and, digital, to, describe, cel, animation, that, uses, significant, computer, technology, examples, of, traditionally, animated, feature, films, include, pinocchio, united, states, 1940, animal, farm, united, kingdom, 1954, lucky, and, zorba, italy, 1998, and, the, illusionist, british, french, 2010, traditionally, animated, films, produced, with, the, aid, of, computer, technology, include, the, lion, king, us, 1994, the, prince, of, egypt, us, 1998, akira, japan, 1988, spirited, away, japan, 2001, the, triplets, of, belleville, france, 2003, and, the, secret, of, kells, irish, french, belgian, 2009, full, animation, is, the, process, of, producing, high, quality, traditionally, animated, films, that, regularly, use, detailed, drawings, and, plausible, movement, having, a, smooth, animation, fully, animated, films, can, be, made, in, a, variety, of, styles, from, more, realistically, animated, works, like, those, produced, by, the, walt, disney, studio, the, little, mermaid, beauty, and, the, beast, aladdin, the, lion, king, to, the, more, cartoon, styles, of, the, warner, bros, animation, studio, many, of, the, disney, animated, features, are, examples, of, full, animation, as, are, non, disney, works, the, secret, of, nimh, us, 1982, the, iron, giant, us, 1999, and, nocturna, spain, 2007, fully, animated, films, are, often, animated, on, twos, sometimes, on, ones, which, means, that, 12, to, 24, drawings, are, required, for, a, single, second, of, film, limited, animation, involves, the, use, of, less, detailed, or, more, stylized, drawings, and, methods, of, movement, usually, a, choppy, or, skippy, movement, animation, limited, animation, uses, fewer, drawings, per, second, thereby, limiting, the, fluidity, of, the, animation, this, is, a, more, economic, technique, pioneered, by, the, artists, at, the, american, studio, united, productions, of, america, limited, animation, can, be, used, as, a, method, of, stylized, artistic, expression, as, in, gerald, mcboing, boing, us, 1951, yellow, submarine, uk, 1968, and, certain, anime, produced, in, japan, its, primary, use, however, has, been, in, producing, cost, effective, animated, content, for, media, for, television, the, work, of, hanna, barbera, filmation, and, other, tv, animation, studios, and, later, the, internet, web, cartoons, rotoscoping, is, a, technique, patented, by, max, fleischer, in, 1917, where, animators, trace, live, action, movement, frame, by, frame, the, source, film, can, be, directly, copied, from, actors, outlines, into, animated, drawings, as, in, the, lord, of, the, rings, us, 1978, or, used, in, a, stylized, and, expressive, manner, as, in, waking, life, us, 2001, and, a, scanner, darkly, us, 2006, some, other, examples, are, fire, and, ice, us, 1983, heavy, metal, 1981, and, aku, no, hana, japan, 2013, live, action, animation, is, a, technique, combining, hand, drawn, characters, into, live, action, shots, or, live, action, actors, into, animated, shots, one, of, the, earlier, uses, was, in, koko, the, clown, when, koko, was, drawn, over, live, action, footage, walt, disney, and, ub, iwerks, created, a, series, of, alice, comedies, 1923, 1927, in, which, a, live, action, girl, enters, an, animated, world, other, examples, include, allegro, non, troppo, italy, 1976, who, framed, roger, rabbit, us, 1988, volere, volare, italy, 1991, space, jam, us, 1996, and, osmosis, jones, us, 2001, stop, motion, is, used, to, describe, animation, created, by, physically, manipulating, real, world, objects, and, photographing, them, one, frame, of, film, at, a, time, to, create, the, illusion, of, movement, there, are, many, different, types, of, stop, motion, animation, usually, named, after, the, materials, used, to, create, the, animation, computer, software, is, widely, available, to, create, this, type, of, animation, traditional, stop, motion, animation, is, usually, less, expensive, but, more, time, consuming, to, produce, than, current, computer, animation, computer, animation, encompasses, a, variety, of, techniques, the, unifying, factor, being, that, the, animation, is, created, digitally, on, a, computer, 2d, animation, techniques, tend, to, focus, on, image, manipulation, while, 3d, techniques, usually, build, virtual, worlds, in, which, characters, and, objects, move, and, interact, 3d, animation, can, create, images, that, seem, real, to, the, viewer, 2d, animation, figures, are, created, or, edited, on, the, computer, using, 2d, bitmap, graphics, and, 2d, vector, graphics, this, includes, automated, computerized, versions, of, traditional, animation, techniques, interpolated, morphing, onion, skinning, and, interpolated, rotoscoping, 2d, animation, has, many, applications, including, after, effects, animation, analog, computer, animation, flash, animation, and, powerpoint, animation, cinemagraphs, are, still, photographs, in, the, form, of, an, animated, gif, file, of, which, part, is, animated, final, line, advection, animation, is, a, technique, used, in, 2d, animation, to, give, artists, and, animators, more, influence, and, control, over, the, final, product, as, everything, is, done, within, the, same, department, speaking, about, using, this, approach, in, paperman, john, kahrs, said, that, our, animators, can, change, things, actually, erase, away, the, cg, underlayer, if, they, want, and, change, the, profile, of, the, arm, 3d, animation, is, digitally, modeled, and, manipulated, by, an, animator, the, 3d, model, maker, usually, starts, by, creating, a, 3d, polygon, mesh, for, the, animator, to, manipulate, a, mesh, typically, includes, many, vertices, that, are, connected, by, edges, and, faces, which, give, the, visual, appearance, of, form, to, a, 3d, object, or, 3d, environment, sometimes, the, mesh, is, given, an, internal, digital, skeletal, structure, called, an, armature, that, can, be, used, to, control, the, mesh, by, weighting, the, vertices, this, process, is, called, rigging, and, can, be, used, in, conjunction, with, key, frames, to, create, movement, other, techniques, can, be, applied, mathematical, functions, e, g, gravity, particle, simulations, simulated, fur, or, hair, and, effects, fire, and, water, simulations, these, techniques, fall, under, the, category, of, 3d, dynamics
