https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Corpus
the, hippocratic, corpus, latin, corpus, hippocraticum, or, hippocratic, collection, is, a, collection, of, around, 60, early, ancient, greek, medical, works, strongly, associated, with, the, physician, hippocrates, and, his, teachings, the, hippocratic, corpus, covers, many, diverse, aspects, of, medicine, from, hippocrates, medical, theories, to, what, he, devised, to, be, ethical, means, of, medical, practice, to, addressing, various, illnesses, even, though, it, is, considered, a, singular, corpus, that, represents, hippocratic, medicine, they, vary, sometimes, significantly, in, content, age, style, methods, and, views, practiced, therefore, authorship, is, largely, unknown, hippocrates, began, western, society, s, development, of, medicine, through, a, delicate, blending, of, the, art, of, healing, and, scientific, observations, what, hippocrates, was, sharing, from, within, his, collection, of, works, was, not, only, how, to, identify, symptoms, of, disease, and, proper, diagnostic, practices, but, more, essentially, he, was, alluding, to, his, personable, form, of, art, the, art, of, true, living, and, the, art, of, fine, medicine, combined, the, hippocratic, corpus, became, the, foundation, upon, which, western, medical, practice, was, built, hippocrates, was, born, c, 460, bce, on, the, greek, island, of, kos, the, verifiable, details, of, his, life, are, few, despite, centuries, of, hagiographic, accounts, according, to, tradition, hippocrates, was, born, into, a, hereditary, order, of, priest, like, physicians, known, as, asclepiads, at, the, time, the, practice, of, medicine, involved, spiritual, and, supernatural, elements, corresponding, to, the, prevailing, belief, that, health, and, illness, were, conferred, by, the, gods, hippocrates, did, not, share, this, view, for, example, according, to, works, later, ascribed, to, him, he, was, the, first, to, describe, epilepsy, as, an, inheritable, brain, disease, rather, than, an, infliction, from, the, divine, in, addition, to, his, rejection, of, purely, divine, causes, of, illness, hippocrates, rejected, the, idea, that, medicine, could, only, be, practiced, by, those, born, into, the, priestly, asclepiad, class, like, himself, he, went, on, to, establish, a, medical, school, at, kos, and, opened, it, to, those, born, outside, of, the, asclepiad, class, known, as, the, father, of, medicine, hippocrates, was, an, admirable, physician, and, teacher, during, his, time, when, considered, among, fellow, ancient, greek, philosophers, and, physicians, hippocrates, was, considered, the, most, influential, in, the, evolution, of, medicine, as, a, science, he, focused, on, a, natural, approach, to, medicine, expressing, that, there, had, to, be, a, comprehensive, understanding, of, the, patient, s, health, as, well, as, harmony, between, nature, and, the, individual, hippocrates, focal, point, for, medicine, stemmed, from, the, practice, of, scientific, discipline, to, enforce, scientific, discipline, hippocrates, based, his, medical, principles, on, natural, sciences, diagnosing, treating, and, preventing, medical, diseases, in, addition, to, a, focus, on, natural, approaches, he, also, began, to, look, into, anatomical, and, physiological, relationships, in, the, body, he, also, heavily, believed, in, the, study, of, anatomy, and, the, nervous, system, by, understanding, the, anatomy, of, the, human, body, hippocrates, was, able, to, recognize, symptoms, holistically, when, diagnosing, a, patient, to, align, completely, with, his, emphasis, on, the, physical, observation, of, the, human, body, hippocrates, eliminated, any, religious, element, from, his, account, of, medicine, in, the, hippocratic, text, on, flesh, on, regimen, on, diseases, i, on, winds, relevant, works, from, the, hippocratic, corpus, he, firmly, established, the, limited, focus, he, planned, to, employ, with, his, medical, concerns, that, is, he, had, determined, that, he, would, only, entertain, natural, phenomena, that, are, relevant, to, the, medical, issue, at, hand, another, contribution, hippocrates, had, to, medicine, was, evidence, based, knowledge, hippocrates, was, the, first, to, ever, establish, the, belief, that, by, simply, observing, a, patient, a, physician, would, recognize, symptoms, and, determine, the, disease, hippocrates, insisted, that, he, must, keep, careful, notes, and, follow, the, patient, from, the, start, of, the, disease, to, the, end, no, matter, what, that, might, have, looked, like, so, he, could, compile, different, symptoms, and, treatments, the, ideal, of, evidence, based, knowledge, is, still, implemented, in, the, medical, field, and, has, set, the, standards, for, physicians, today, according, to, hippocrates, medicine, was, dependent, on, detailed, observation, of, symptoms, and, health, prognosis, treatment, of, the, patient, and, reason, to, establish, diagnosis, while, the, hippocratic, corpus, was, not, written, by, hippocrates, himself, the, compiled, work, of, medical, professionals, all, follow, the, same, guidelines, imposed, by, hippocratic, medicine, hippocrates, laid, the, foundation, for, modern, medicine, as, his, protocols, and, guidelines, for, the, classification, of, diseases, are, being, utilized, by, physicians, today, his, principles, for, the, diagnosis, treatment, and, prevention, of, diseases, have, been, preserved, in, the, hippocratic, corpus, and, are, the, standard, for, medical, ethics, today, of, the, texts, in, the, corpus, none, is, proven, to, be, by, hippocrates, himself, the, works, of, the, corpus, range, from, hippocrates, time, and, school, to, many, centuries, later, and, rival, points, of, view, franz, zacharias, ermerins, identifies, the, hands, of, at, least, nineteen, authors, in, the, hippocratic, corpus, however, the, varied, works, of, the, corpus, have, gone, under, hippocrates, name, since, antiquity, according, to, howard, clark, kee, its, a, haphazard, collection, of, anonymous, authors, the, corpus, may, be, the, remains, of, a, library, of, cos, or, a, collection, compiled, in, the, third, century, bc, in, alexandria, however, the, corpus, includes, works, beyond, those, of, the, coan, school, of, ancient, greek, medicine, works, from, the, cnidian, school, are, included, as, well, only, a, fraction, of, the, hippocratic, writings, have, survived, the, lost, medical, literature, is, sometimes, referred, to, in, the, surviving, treatises, as, at, the, beginning, of, regimen, some, hippocratic, works, are, known, only, in, translation, from, their, original, greek, to, other, languages, given, that, the, quality, and, accuracy, of, a, translation, without, a, surviving, original, cannot, be, known, it, is, difficult, to, identify, the, author, with, certainty, hippocratic, texts, survive, in, arabic, hebrew, syriac, and, latin, the, majority, of, the, works, in, the, hippocratic, corpus, date, from, the, classical, period, the, last, decades, of, the, 5th, century, bc, and, the, first, half, of, the, 4th, century, bc, among, the, later, works, the, law, on, the, heart, on, the, physician, and, on, sevens, are, all, hellenistic, while, precepts, and, on, decorum, are, from, the, 1st, and, 2nd, centuries, ad, some, of, the, earliest, works, of, the, corpus, mid, fifth, century, are, connected, to, the, cnidian, school, on, diseases, ii, iii, and, the, early, layer, within, on, the, diseases, of, women, i, ii, and, on, sterile, women, prorrhetics, i, is, also, mid, fifth, century, in, the, second, half, of, the, fifth, century, a, single, author, likely, produced, the, treatises, on, airs, waters, places, prognostics, prorrhetics, ii, and, on, the, sacred, disease, other, fifth, century, works, include, on, fleshes, epidemics, i, and, iii, c, 410, bc, on, ancient, medicine, on, regimen, in, acute, diseases, and, polybus, on, the, nature, of, man, regimen, in, health, 410, 400, bc, at, the, end, of, the, fifth, or, the, beginning, of, the, fourth, century, one, author, likely, wrote, epidemics, ii, iv, vi, and, on, the, humors, the, coherent, group, of, surgical, treatises, on, fractures, on, joints, on, injuries, of, the, head, surgery, mochlicon, is, of, similar, date, the, gynecological, treatises, on, the, nature, of, the, woman, on, the, diseases, of, women, generation, on, the, nature, of, the, child, and, on, sterile, women, constitute, a, closely, related, group, hermann, grensemann, identified, five, layers, of, material, in, this, group, from, the, mid, fifth, century, to, the, mid, fourth, century, the, oldest, stratum, is, found, in, on, the, nature, of, the, woman, and, on, the, diseases, of, women, ii, generation, and, on, the, nature, of, the, child, constitute, a, single, work, by, a, late, fifth, century, author, who, may, also, be, identified, as, the, author, of, on, diseases, iv, and, of, sections, of, on, the, diseases, of, women, i, the, latest, layer, is, on, sterile, women, which, was, composed, after, the, other, gynecological, treatises, were, in, existence, a, single, fourth, century, author, probably, wrote, on, fistulae, and, on, hemorrhoids, author, susan, wise, bauer, writes, that, because, it, explains, disease, without, blaming, or, invoking, the, gods, the, corpus, is, the, first, surviving, book, of, science, the, hippocratic, corpus, contains, textbooks, lectures, research, notes, and, philosophical, essays, on, various, subjects, in, medicine, in, no, particular, order, these, works, were, written, for, different, audiences, both, specialists, and, laymen, and, were, sometimes, written, from, opposing, view, points, significant, contradictions, can, be, found, between, works, in, the, corpus, one, significant, portion, of, the, corpus, is, made, up, of, case, histories, books, i, and, iii, of, epidemics, contain, forty, two, case, histories, of, which, 60, 25, ended, in, the, patient, s, death, nearly, all, of, the, diseases, described, in, the, corpus, are, endemic, diseases, colds, consumption, pneumonia, etc, in, several, texts, of, the, corpus, the, ancient, physicians, develop, theories, of, illness, sometimes, grappling, with, the, methodological, difficulties, that, lie, in, the, way, of, effective, and, consistent, diagnosis, and, treatment, as, scholar, jacques, jouanna, writes, one, of, the, great, merits, of, the, physicians, of, the, hippocratic, corpus, is, that, they, are, not, content, to, practice, medicine, and, to, commit, their, experience, to, writing, but, that, they, have, reflected, on, their, own, activity, while, the, approaches, range, from, empiricism, to, a, rationalism, reminiscent, of, the, physical, theories, of, the, pre, socratic, philosophers, these, two, tendencies, can, exist, side, by, side, the, close, association, between, knowledge, and, experience, is, characteristic, of, the, hippocratics, despite, the, platonic, attempt, to, drive, a, wedge, between, the, two, the, author, of, on, ancient, medicine, launches, immediately, into, a, critique, of, opponents, who, posit, a, single, cause, in, all, cases, of, disease, having, laid, down, as, a, hypothesis, for, their, account, hot, or, cold, or, wet, or, dry, or, anything, else, they, want, the, method, put, forward, in, this, treatise, could, certainly, be, characterized, as, an, empirical, one, preferring, the, effects, of, diet, as, observed, by, the, senses, to, cosmological, speculations, and, it, was, seized, upon, by, hellenistic, empiricist, doctors, for, this, reason, however, unlike, the, empiricists, the, author, does, not, claim, that, the, doctor, s, knowledge, is, limited, to, what, can, be, observed, by, the, senses, on, the, contrary, he, requires, the, doctor, to, have, quite, extensive, knowledge, of, aspects, of, the, human, constitution, that, cannot, be, observed, directly, such, as, the, state, of, the, patient, s, humors, and, internal, organs, the, author, of, the, art, is, at, pains, to, defend, the, status, of, medicine, as, an, art, techne, against, opponents, who, perhaps, following, protagoras, critique, of, expert, knowledge, claim, it, produces, no, better, results, against, disease, than, chance, an, attack, served, by, the, fact, that, doctors, refused, to, treat, the, serious, and, difficult, cases, they, judged, to, be, incurable, by, their, art, the, treatise, may, be, considered, the, first, attempt, at, general, epistemology, bequeathed, to, us, by, antiquity, although, this, may, only, be, because, we, have, lost, fifth, century, rhetorical, works, that, took, a, similar, approach, for, this, writer, as, for, the, author, of, on, the, places, in, man, the, art, of, medicine, has, been, wholly, discovered, while, for, the, author, of, on, the, places, in, man, the, principles, discovered, in, it, clearly, have, very, little, need, of, good, luck, the, author, of, the, art, acknowledges, the, practical, limitations, that, arise, in, the, therapeutic, application, of, these, principles, likewise, for, the, author, of, on, regimen, the, knowledge, and, discernment, of, the, nature, of, man, in, general, knowledge, of, its, primary, constituents, and, discernment, of, the, components, by, which, it, is, controlled, may, be, completely, worked, out, and, yet, in, practice, it, is, difficult, to, determine, and, apply, the, correct, and, proportionate, diet, and, exercise, to, the, individual, patient, the, hippocratic, corpus, explains, diseases, using, the, four, humours, in, which, are, described, a, phlegm, yellow, bile, blood, and, black, bile, these, medical, writings, associated, each, of, the, humours, with, a, specific, organ, which, goes, as, follows, blood, with, the, heart, yellow, bile, with, the, liver, black, bile, with, the, spleen, and, phlegm, with, the, brain, with, each, humour, there, were, specific, properties, that, applied, to, changes, in, the, fluids, such, as, blood, is, hot, and, moist, phlegm, is, cold, and, moist, yellow, bile, is, hot, and, dry, and, black, bile, is, cold, and, dry, the, authors, of, the, hippocratic, corpus, described, that, these, four, humors, play, a, very, important, role, in, our, health, as, when, there, is, a, little, or, too, much, of, one, of, the, humours, a, disease, might, occur, the, most, controversial, elements, of, health, and, disease, during, the, bc, time, was, the, issue, of, mental, illnesses, as, it, was, always, related, to, a, higher, power, punishment, or, demonic, nature, the, hippocratic, corpus, employed, many, new, vocabulary, words, to, describe, mental, ailments, that, coincided, with, intensity, duration, or, severity, and, used, these, terms, to, scale, from, mildest, to, the, strongest, form, whatever, their, disagreements, the, hippocratic, writers, agree, in, rejecting, divine, and, religious, causes, and, remedies, of, disease, in, favor, of, natural, mechanisms, hippocratic, medicine, had, been, formulated, to, hold, true, to, the, belief, that, medicine, should, be, practiced, as, a, scientific, discipline, based, on, the, natural, sciences, diagnosing, and, preventing, disease, as, well, as, treating, them, this, not, only, influenced, the, relevance, of, heaven, in, medicine, and, the, church, s, influence, on, the, practice, of, medicine, but, also, the, relevance, of, astronomy, and, cosmology, in, medicine, as, a, science, greek, tragedy, encouraged, the, spread, of, false, knowledge, about, the, divine, origin, of, human, diseases, greek, gods, were, placed, on, a, pedestal, and, seen, as, healers, as, a, result, to, combat, this, view, of, diseases, hippocratic, physicians, restricted, their, diagnoses, to, rational, causes, and, rejected, anthropomorphic, intervention, as, the, cause, and, solution, of, medical, issues, in, addition, to, greek, poetry, and, tragedy, magicians, charlatans, and, purifiers, can, also, be, considered, responsible, for, the, widespread, of, sacred, explanations, doing, this, allowed, them, to, step, in, and, provide, inefficacious, remedies, that, could, convince, the, gods, to, intervene, and, fix, these, sacred, issues, experienced, by, individuals, thus, on, the, sacred, disease, considers, that, epilepsy, the, so, called, sacred, disease, has, a, natural, cause, and, its, supposed, divine, origin, is, due, to, men, s, inexperience, and, to, their, wonder, at, its, peculiar, character, an, exception, to, this, rule, is, found, in, dreams, regime, iv, in, which, prayers, to, the, gods, are, prescribed, alongside, more, typically, hippocratic, interventions, though, materialistic, determinism, goes, back, in, greek, thought, at, least, to, leucippus, one, of, the, greatest, virtues, of, the, physicians, of, the, hippocratic, collection, is, to, have, stated, in, its, most, universal, form, what, was, later, to, be, called, the, principle, of, determinism, all, that, occurs, has, a, cause, it, is, in, the, treatise, of, the, art, that, the, most, theoretical, statement, of, this, principle, is, to, be, found, indeed, under, a, close, examination, spontaneity, disappears, for, everything, that, occurs, will, be, found, to, do, so, through, something, in, a, famous, passage, of, on, ancient, medicine, the, author, insists, on, the, importance, of, knowledge, of, causal, explanations, it, is, not, sufficient, to, learn, simply, that, cheese, is, a, bad, food, as, it, gives, a, pain, to, one, who, eats, a, surfeit, of, it, we, must, know, what, the, pain, is, the, reasons, for, it, and, which, constituent, of, man, is, harmfully, affected, the, writers, of, the, treatises, in, the, hippocratic, corpus, emphasized, a, natural, approach, to, health, and, wellness, during, the, asclepius, paradigm, hippocrates, used, a, natural, way, to, treat, disease, these, natural, approaches, emphasized, the, importance, of, the, harmony, between, the, human, body, and, the, environment, in, which, we, live, in, writings, in, the, hippocratic, corpus, also, emphasized, the, importance, of, realizing, how, the, environment, might, cause, diseases, treating, diseases, with, a, natural, approach, is, also, a, topic, that, can, be, found, in, the, hippocratic, corpus, hippocratic, tradition, also, found, that, it, is, important, to, understand, the, causes, of, physiological, factors, and, how, these, physiological, factors, hold, a, therapeutic, significance, to, add, to, the, natural, approach, of, health, and, wellness, hippocratic, tradition, also, emphasized, that, the, mind, body, and, spirit, were, all, independent, of, one, another, health, promotion, was, another, topic, found, in, the, treatises, of, the, hippocratic, corpus, to, promote, the, well, being, of, students, and, their, physical, and, mental, health, in, schools, physical, activity, was, conducted, as, a, necessary, activity, that, allowed, the, student, s, physical, health, to, be, the, best, it, could, be, an, example, of, health, promotion, being, used, can, be, found, during, the, olympic, games, one, example, of, health, promotion, being, used, during, the, olympic, games, was, olive, oil, being, used, to, warm, up, athletes, body, temperatures, so, that, they, could, perform, to, the, best, of, their, abilities, ancient, greeks, believed, that, it, was, essential, to, have, a, harmony, between, the, body, and, the, mind, this, led, to, the, idea, of, a, healthy, mind, in, a, healthy, body, which, is, a, common, phrase, that, people, might, hear, food, was, another, topic, of, health, promotion, in, the, hippocratic, corpus, these, writings, discussed, that, in, order, for, food, to, be, beneficial, to, the, health, of, one, the, source, should, be, adapted, to, human, nature, and, food, is, defined, as, more, forceful, or, less, forceful, properties, it, was, explained, in, the, hippocratic, corpus, that, to, avoid, a, diet, that, was, too, forceful, we, must, implement, cooking, and, mixing, as, this, was, already, a, type, of, medicine, that, can, help, ease, the, cause, of, suffering, illness, and, death, it, has, been, discovered, that, during, the, olympic, games, figs, and, other, fruits, were, given, to, the, athletes, so, that, the, high, concentration, of, glucose, in, the, food, would, give, them, the, energy, they, needed, to, compete, to, the, best, of, their, ability, the, duties, of, the, physician, are, an, object, of, the, hippocratic, writers, attention, the, series, of, texts, composing, the, corpus, educates, readers, on, the, practices, of, identifying, symptoms, in, patients, diagnosis, prognosis, treatments, ethics, and, bedside, manner, in, ancient, greece, being, a, man, of, high, morals, went, hand, in, hand, with, being, a, morally, just, physician, a, famous, maxim, epidemics, i, 11, advises, as, to, diseases, make, a, habit, of, two, things, to, help, or, at, least, to, do, no, harm, the, most, famous, work, in, the, hippocratic, corpus, is, the, hippocratic, oath, a, landmark, declaration, of, medical, ethics, the, hippocratic, oath, is, both, philosophical, and, practical, it, not, only, deals, with, abstract, principles, but, practical, matters, such, as, removing, stones, and, aiding, one, s, teacher, financially, it, is, a, complex, and, probably, not, the, work, of, one, man, it, remains, in, use, though, rarely, in, its, original, form, the, preamble, of, on, the, physician, offers, a, physical, and, moral, portrait, of, the, ideal, physician, and, the, precepts, also, concern, the, physician, s, conduct, treatises, such, as, on, joints, and, epidemics, vi, are, concerned, with, the, provision, of, such, courtesies, as, providing, a, patient, with, cushions, during, a, procedure, and, decorum, includes, advice, on, good, manners, to, be, observed, in, the, doctor, s, office, or, when, visiting, patients, with, many, books, incorporating, different, urology, practices, and, observations, and, nearly, 30, works, in, the, hippocratic, book, collection, entitled, aphorism, seemingly, solely, dedicated, to, urology, in, general, urology, was, one, subject, that, was, thoroughly, investigated, seemingly, the, main, and, most, problematic, topic, covered, in, urology, was, that, of, bladder, disease, in, patients, especially, when, urinary, tract, stones, that, is, stones, within, either, the, kidneys, or, the, bladder, were, present, urinary, tract, stones, in, general, have, been, seen, within, records, all, throughout, history, even, as, far, back, as, the, ancient, days, of, egypt, theorizing, how, these, urinary, tract, stones, formed, how, to, detect, them, and, other, bladder, issues, and, the, controversy, on, how, to, treat, them, were, all, major, investigating, points, to, the, authors, of, the, hippocratic, corpus, throughout, the, books, of, the, hippocratic, corpus, there, are, varying, hypotheses, as, to, reasons, why, and, exactly, how, urinary, tract, stones, actually, formed, it, is, noted, that, these, hypotheses, were, all, based, on, the, use, of, uroscopy, and, observation, of, patients, by, doctors, of, the, time, the, main, mechanism, of, detecting, bladder, disease, s, symptoms, including, inflammation, and, urinary, tract, stone, formations, is, through, the, appearance, of, the, urine, itself, and, the, changes, that, occur, with, the, urine, over, time, in, aphorism, it, was, simply, stated, that, as, the, appearance, of, urine, diverges, more, and, more, from, the, appearance, of, healthy, urine, the, more, likely, it, is, to, be, diseased, and, the, worse, the, disease, becomes, in, aphorism, works, it, was, noted, that, urine, lacking, color, could, indicate, diseases, of, the, brain, some, today, think, that, this, author, who, made, this, statement, was, meaning, to, refer, to, chronic, renal, failure, or, even, diabetes, it, was, also, suggested, that, the, appearance, of, blood, within, urine, could, indicate, vessels, of, the, kidney, to, have, burst, potentially, due, to, necrosis, of, blood, arteries, or, vessels, furthermore, doctors, noted, that, if, bubbles, formed, on, top, of, urine, the, kidneys, were, diseased, and, showed, the, potential, of, long, lasting, disease, when, it, comes, to, the, treatment, of, urinary, tract, stones, many, solutions, were, suggested, including, drinking, a, lot, of, a, water, wine, mixture, taking, strong, medication, or, trying, different, positions, when, trying, to, flush, them, out, extracting, the, urinary, tract, stones, was, another, option, however, this, method, was, not, utilized, very, often, due, to, its, serious, risks, and, possible, complications, of, cutting, into, the, bladder, other, than, leakage, of, urine, into, the, body, cavity, another, common, complication, was, that, of, the, cells, of, the, testes, dying, due, to, the, spermatic, cord, inadvertently, being, cut, during, the, procedure, in, fact, due, to, these, and, other, complications, and, the, lack, of, antiseptics, and, pain, medicines, the, hippocratic, oath, opted, for, the, avoidance, of, surgery, unless, absolutely, necessary, especially, when, concerning, surgeries, that, dealt, with, the, urinary, tract, and, more, so, when, stone, removal, was, the, intent, although, the, urinary, tract, stone, removal, was, not, a, necessary, surgery, and, it, appeared, to, be, avoided, in, most, cases, some, argue, that, the, hippocratic, oath, only, wards, of, these, procedures, if, the, doctor, holding, the, knife, is, inexperienced, in, that, area, this, idea, puts, forth, the, development, of, medical, specialties, that, is, doctors, focusing, on, one, particular, area, of, medicine, versus, studying, the, wide, array, of, material, that, is, medicine, the, doctors, whom, have, become, experts, in, the, urinary, tract, whom, we, would, call, urologists, today, are, those, that, could, perform, the, heightened, risk, procedure, of, stone, removal, with, this, reliance, on, specialized, doctors, of, the, urinary, tract, some, believe, that, urology, itself, was, the, first, definable, expertise, of, medical, history, references, to, wine, can, be, found, throughout, greek, antiquity, in, both, dramas, and, medical, texts, the, hippocratic, texts, describe, wine, as, a, powerful, substance, that, when, consumed, in, excess, can, cause, physical, disorders, today, known, as, intoxication, although, the, negative, effects, of, wine, on, the, human, body, are, documented, within, the, hippocratic, corpus, the, author, authors, maintain, an, objective, attitude, towards, wine, during, this, time, those, studying, medicine, were, interested, in, the, physical, effects, of, wine, therefore, no, medical, text, condemned, the, use, of, wine, in, excess, according, to, the, hippocratic, text, the, consumption, of, wine, significantly, affects, two, regions, of, the, body, the, head, and, the, lower, body, cavity, excessive, drinking, can, cause, heaviness, of, the, head, and, pain, in, the, head, in, addition, to, disturbances, in, thought, in, the, lower, body, cavity, excess, wine, ingestion, can, have, a, purging, effect, it, can, be, the, source, of, stomach, pain, diarrhea, and, vomiting, this, stomach, pain, was, more, common, among, athletes, because, of, their, intense, diets, composed, mainly, of, meat, and, wine, an, overall, effect, of, wine, that, all, greek, doctors, of, the, time, have, observed, and, agree, on, is, its, warming, property, therefore, wine, s, properties, are, described, as, hot, and, dry, as, documented, in, the, hippocratic, texts, extreme, use, of, wine, can, result, in, death, physicians, tried, to, study, the, human, body, with, pure, objectivity, to, give, the, most, accurate, explanation, for, the, effects, of, external, substances, that, could, be, given, for, the, time, during, this, period, physicians, believed, not, all, wines, were, equally, potent, in, producing, a, range, of, perilous, symptoms, according, to, the, hippocratic, texts, physicians, carefully, categorized, wine, by, properties, such, as, color, taste, viscosity, smell, and, age, according, to, hippocrates, a, more, concentrated, wine, leads, to, a, heavy, head, and, difficulty, thinking, and, a, soft, wine, inflames, the, spleen, and, liver, and, produces, wind, in, the, intestine, other, observations, of, the, ingestion, of, wine, included, the, varying, levels, of, tolerance, within, the, population, being, observed, this, observation, led, to, the, belief, that, the, size, of, one, s, body, and, one, s, environment, had, an, influence, on, ability, to, handle, wine, because, of, this, different, people, would, require, different, concentrations, and, dilutions, of, wine, for, medicinal, use, after, observation, men, with, larger, bodies, were, able, to, consume, more, than, men, with, smaller, bodies, and, the, same, effects, could, be, observed, between, them, physician, s, also, hypothesized, that, gender, contributed, to, the, effects, of, wine, on, the, body, women, were, noted, to, have, a, cold, and, wet, nature, which, encouraged, hippocratic, doctors, to, prescribe, them, undiluted, wine, this, differed, from, men, who, typically, were, hotter, by, nature, it, was, not, common, practice, between, physicians, of, the, time, to, recommend, the, consumption, of, wine, for, children, physicians, collectively, believed, that, there, was, no, purpose, for, children, to, drink, wine, however, in, rare, circumstances, there, are, records, of, some, doctors, recommending, wine, for, children, only, if, heavily, diluted, with, water, to, warm, the, child, or, to, ease, hunger, pains, mostly, doctors, prohibited, wine, consumption, for, people, under, eighteen, greek, physicians, were, very, interested, in, observing, and, recording, the, effects, of, wine, and, intoxication, the, excessive, use, of, wine, was, well, known, to, be, harmful, however, it, was, also, documented, as, a, useful, remedy, several, of, the, hippocratic, texts, list, the, properties, and, use, of, foods, consumed, during, 5th, century, bc, wine, was, first, defined, as, a, food, by, all, doctors, directions, for, consumption, varied, based, on, gender, season, and, other, events, in, daily, life, men, were, encouraged, to, consume, dark, undiluted, wine, before, copulation, not, to, the, point, of, intoxication, however, enough, to, provide, power, and, guarantee, strength, to, the, fetus, because, of, wine, s, visual, similarity, to, blood, physicians, had, assumed, a, relationship, between, the, two, substances, for, this, reason, men, with, cardiac, illness, lack, of, strength, or, pale, complexion, were, encouraged, to, consume, dark, undiluted, wine, multiple, texts, within, the, hippocratic, corpus, advise, the, use, of, wine, in, accordance, with, the, seasons, during, the, winter, wine, must, be, undiluted, to, counter, the, cold, and, wet, because, wine, s, properties, are, dry, and, hot, during, fall, and, spring, wine, should, be, moderately, diluted, and, during, the, summer, wine, should, be, diluted, as, much, as, possible, with, water, because, of, the, hot, temperatures, the, practice, of, mixing, wine, and, diluting, wine, is, also, seen, in, prescription, form, however, the, dosage, and, quantities, are, left, to, the, doctor, the, prescription, of, wine, as, a, treatment, was, prohibited, with, diseases, that, affected, the, head, brain, and, those, accompanied, by, a, fever, wine, could, also, be, used, as, an, external, remedy, by, mixing, it, with, other, substances, such, as, honey, milk, water, or, oil, to, make, salves, or, soaks, patients, with, pneumonia, like, illnesses, would, soak, in, a, wine, mixture, and, breath, in, the, vapors, with, the, intent, to, expel, the, pus, from, their, lungs, wine, was, frequently, prescribed, as, a, topical, remedy, for, sores, because, of, its, drying, effect, epidemics, 1, begins, by, describing, each, season, s, characteristics, it, states, that, autumn, has, strong, south, winds, and, many, rainy, days, winter, had, south, winds, with, the, occasional, north, wind, and, droughts, spring, was, southerly, and, cold, with, slight, rain, summer, was, cloudy, and, did, not, rain, it, then, described, diseases, associated, with, each, season, for, example, in, spring, many, people, began, having, mild, fevers, which, in, some, cases, caused, hemorrhage, the, hemorrhage, was, rarely, fatal, swelling, next, to, both, ears, was, also, common, coughs, and, sore, throats, accompanied, the, other, symptoms, based, on, modern, knowledge, this, disease, was, mumps, which, causes, salivary, glands, under, the, ears, to, swell, it, is, remarkable, that, this, ancient, work, describes, symptoms, so, vividly, that, modern, doctors, can, diagnose, the, cause, a, thousand, years, later, this, section, of, the, hippocratic, corpus, assumes, that, when, looking, at, human, disease, and, the, health, of, humans, you, must, look, at, the, seasons, winds, and, orientation, of, places, the, nature, of, the, water, the, nature, of, the, soil, and, the, lifestyle, of, the, inhabitants, of, a, particular, city, epidemics, 1, goes, on, to, describe, the, climate, on, two, occasions, and, the, diseases, associated, with, them, called, constitutions, the, symptoms, described, include, more, serious, sometimes, lethal, fevers, eye, infections, and, dysentery, jaundice, is, a, disease, that, is, mentioned, numerous, times, throughout, and, is, described, as, occurring, in, five, ways, jaundice, is, when, the, skin, or, eyes, turn, yellow, the, greek, physicians, thought, of, jaundice, to, be, a, disease, itself, rather, than, what, medical, professionals, know, now, to, be, a, symptom, of, various, other, diseases, the, greeks, also, believed, that, there, were, five, kinds, of, jaundice, that, can, occur, and, report, the, differences, between, them, the, first, kind, can, quickly, turn, fatal, the, skin, appears, to, be, green, the, analogy, made, in, the, text, is, that, the, skin, is, greener, than, a, green, lizard, the, patient, will, have, fevers, shiver, and, the, skin, becomes, very, sensitive, in, the, mornings, sharp, pains, occur, in, the, abdominal, region, if, the, patient, survives, more, than, two, weeks, they, have, a, chance, of, recovery, the, treatments, suggest, drinking, a, mixture, of, milk, and, other, nuts, and, plants, in, the, morning, and, at, night, the, second, form, develops, only, during, the, summer, because, it, was, believed, the, heat, of, the, sun, causes, bile, a, dark, green, fluid, produced, by, the, liver, to, rest, underneath, the, skin, this, causes, a, yellowish, color, to, the, skin, and, pale, eyes, and, urine, the, scalp, also, develops, a, crusty, substance, the, treatment, calls, for, several, baths, a, day, on, top, of, the, mixture, mentioned, in, the, first, remedy, surviving, past, two, weeks, with, this, form, of, jaundice, was, rare, in, two, other, forms, of, this, disease, occurring, during, the, winter, set, in, due, to, drunkenness, chills, and, the, excess, production, of, phlegm, the, last, form, is, the, least, fatal, and, most, common, it, is, associated, with, eating, and, drinking, too, much, the, symptoms, include, yellow, eyes, and, skin, fever, headache, and, weakness, the, treatment, however, it, very, different, from, the, rest, the, physician, will, draw, blood, from, the, elbows, and, advise, to, take, hot, baths, drink, cucumber, juice, and, induce, vomiting, to, clear, the, bowels, if, the, treatment, is, followed, a, full, recovery, is, possible, the, several, forms, of, jaundice, that, the, greek, physicians, proclaimed, might, be, because, jaundice, occurs, due, to, varying, sicknesses, like, hepatitis, gallstones, and, tumors, the, diverse, set, of, symptoms, were, probably, the, effects, of, the, sicknesses, rather, than, the, jaundice, itself, an, empyema, is, a, greek, word, derived, from, the, word, empyein, which, means, pus, producing, according, to, the, hippocratic, corpus, they, can, occur, in, the, thorax, the, uterus, the, bladder, the, ear, and, other, parts, of, the, body, however, the, writings, indicate, that, the, thorax, was, the, most, common, and, provided, more, description, physicians, at, the, time, thought, that, the, cause, of, an, empyema, was, by, orally, ingesting, some, form, of, foreign, body, where, it, will, enter, the, lungs, this, could, be, done, by, inhaling, or, drinking, the, foreign, body, the, physicians, also, thought, that, empyemas, could, occur, after, parapneumonic, infections, or, pleurisy, because, the, chest, has, not, recovered, from, those, illnesses, parapneumonic, infections, can, be, tied, to, modern, pneumonia, which, can, still, be, fatal, there, are, many, symptoms, associated, with, an, empyema, ranging, from, mild, to, severe, the, most, common, ones, are, fever, thoracic, pain, sweating, heaviness, in, the, chest, and, a, cough, treating, an, empyema, was, primarily, done, using, herbal, remedies, or, non, invasive, treatments, mostly, mixtures, of, plants, and, organic, matter, were, drunk, or, bathed, in, there, are, a, few, extreme, cases, in, which, invasive, procedures, were, performed, and, mentioned, in, detail, one, of, these, treatments, included, the, patient, behind, held, down, in, a, chair, while, the, physician, cut, between, the, ribs, with, a, scalpel, and, inserted, a, drainage, tube, which, would, remove, all, of, the, pus, the, research, and, descriptions, that, the, greek, physicians, performed, were, so, accurate, that, they, were, the, foundation, of, what, we, know, about, empyemas, today, the, hippocratic, corpus, provides, valuable, guidance, for, dermatology, and, the, diagnosis, of, skin, diseases, or, infections, hippocrates, described, multiple, dermatologic, diseases, specifically, in, neonatal, and, pediatrics, these, diseases, included, intertrigo, lichenoid, eruptions, vitiligo, furuncle, leprosy, papulosquamous, disease, skin, reactions, to, specific, medications, skin, reactions, to, mosquito, bites, warts, scabies, and, impetigo, along, with, the, variety, of, skin, diseases, described, in, the, hippocratic, corpus, is, the, suggest, treatment, these, treatments, stem, from, the, belief, that, dermatologic, diseases, were, a, result, of, imbalance, in, body, humors, for, relief, from, various, dermatologic, conditions, the, hippocratic, text, recommends, spring, water, or, seawater, baths, and, topical, application, of, a, fatty, substance, as, a, form, of, treatment, for, intertrigo, or, infant, chafing, myrrh, oil, and, litharge, were, powerful, astringent, compounds, that, were, recommended, as, a, form, of, treatment, for, lichenoid, skin, conditions, vinegar, steam, baths, pumice, stones, and, manna, sugar, substance, derived, from, mica, thuris, plant, were, recommended, to, treat, this, skin, disease, the, hippocratic, text, also, offers, sulfur, as, a, treatment, for, lichenoid, which, has, a, strong, antibacterial, effect, that, is, still, prescribed, in, dermatologic, medications, today, for, leprosy, and, vitiligo, lime, water, and, concentrated, vinegar, are, recommended, by, the, hippocratic, corpus, to, treat, these, conditions, many, of, these, forms, of, treatment, proposed, in, the, hippocratic, corpus, are, utilized, today, for, dermatologic, infections, modern, medicine, makes, use, of, sulfur, as, an, antibacterial, compound, spring, water, has, shown, effective, benefits, when, treating, skin, diseases, and, oil, based, products, such, as, myrrh, oil, and, litharge, are, used, as, ointments, to, treat, intertrigo, eczemas, and, skin, lesions, when, reflecting, on, the, treatments, of, skin, diseases, and, infections, in, the, hippocratic, corpus, it, is, evident, that, some, of, the, approaches, when, applied, to, modern, dermatology, are, still, valid, the, hippocratic, corpus, contains, many, contributions, from, across, the, medical, field, including, notes, on, conception, some, of, these, contributions, were, put, into, two, sections, of, the, corpus, called, diseases, of, women, i, and, diseases, of, women, ii, the, sections, go, into, detail, on, concepts, such, as, abortion, obstetrical, notes, and, early, forms, of, gynecology, the, diseases, of, women, details, that, an, infertile, woman, with, a, low, menstruation, rate, may, have, a, bent, cervix, that, essentially, blocks, the, pathway, it, offers, a, few, treatments, in, the, way, of, treating, a, bent, cervix, depending, on, how, the, generating, seed, is, washed, down, and, the, length, of, time, it, takes, for, that, to, happen, options, are, offered, for, treating, the, uterus, head, and, body, depending, on, the, observation, of, the, seed, menses, is, another, way, of, wording, menstruation, or, blood, flow, discharge, from, the, uterus, there, are, multiple, sections, within, the, works, dedicated, to, different, types, of, menses, along, with, their, understood, meanings, of, the, time, there, is, a, large, portion, dedicated, to, what, a, doctor, should, expect, of, standard, menses, along, with, some, slight, variations, within, the, diseases, of, women, i, the, average, amount, of, menses, for, healthy, women, should, be, somewhere, around, a, half, pint, for, around, two, three, days, the, flow, itself, is, considered, to, require, the, viewers, judgment, but, does, go, on, to, say, that, it, should, flow, like, a, blood, from, a, sacrificial, lamb, indicating, the, timeframe, of, the, work, and, that, the, blood, should, coagulate, readily, the, health, of, an, individual, or, even, their, likelihood, of, pregnancy, was, remarked, upon, by, evaluating, the, length, of, the, menstruation, a, menstruation, period, longer, than, four, days, was, thought, to, be, an, indicator, of, more, delicate, embryos, less, than, three, days, is, said, to, indicate, robust, and, healthy, individuals, but, would, lead, to, likely, infertility, the, lochia, and, its, presence, is, noted, along, with, other, possible, complications, after, childbirth, uterus, sensitivity, lower, back, pain, aches, across, the, body, swelling, and, chills, are, all, noted, to, be, expected, fever, is, the, outlier, that, have, different, treatments, based, on, the, treaty, bathing, with, oils, along, with, lily, oil, rubbed, on, the, woman, s, head, is, recommended, oil, should, also, be, applied, to, her, uterus, vapor, baths, in, general, are, the, main, focus, for, treatment, after, childbirth, the, change, with, a, fever, is, to, avoid, bathing, vapor, treatment, with, an, application, using, a, hot, towel, is, recommended, on, her, lower, stomach, and, back, a, diet, of, boiled, meal, with, rue, or, barley, gruel, is, recommended, seemingly, for, with, or, without, a, fever, a, paragraph, is, dedicated, to, the, experience, in, childbirth, of, the, woman, in, question, affecting, the, post, childbirth, reactions, women, are, noted, to, not, have, an, understanding, of, what, sickness, they, may, have, or, the, pride, of, the, woman, causing, her, to, not, discuss, their, symptoms, the, paragraph, pleads, for, doctors, themselves, to, be, well, versed, in, the, possible, post, birth, diseases, that, women, may, have, and, know, how, to, spot, it, themselves, the, writing, style, of, the, corpus, has, been, remarked, upon, for, centuries, being, described, by, some, as, clear, precise, and, simple, it, is, often, praised, for, its, objectivity, and, conciseness, yet, some, have, criticized, it, as, being, grave, and, austere, francis, adams, a, translator, of, the, corpus, goes, further, and, calls, it, sometimes, obscure, of, course, not, all, of, the, corpus, is, of, this, laconic, style, though, most, of, it, is, it, was, hippocratic, practice, to, write, in, this, style, the, whole, corpus, is, written, in, ionic, greek, though, the, island, of, cos, was, in, a, region, that, spoke, doric, greek, the, art, and, on, breaths, show, the, influence, of, sophistic, rhetoric, they, are, characterized, by, long, introductions, and, conclusions, antitheses, anaphoras, and, sound, effects, typical, of, gorgianic, style, other, works, also, have, rhetorical, elements, in, general, it, can, be, said, that, the, hippocratic, physician, was, also, an, orator, with, his, role, including, public, speeches, and, verbal, wrestling, matches, the, entire, hippocratic, corpus, was, first, printed, as, a, unit, in, 1525, this, edition, was, in, latin, and, was, edited, by, marcus, fabius, calvus, in, rome, the, first, complete, greek, edition, followed, the, next, year, from, the, aldine, press, in, venice, a, significant, edition, was, that, of, mile, littr, who, spent, twenty, two, years, 1839, 1861, working, diligently, on, a, complete, greek, edition, and, french, translation, of, the, hippocratic, corpus, this, was, scholarly, yet, sometimes, inaccurate, and, awkward, another, edition, of, note, was, that, of, franz, zacharias, ermerins, published, in, utrecht, between, 1859, and, 1864, k, hlewein, s, teubner, edition, 1894, 1902, mark, a, distinct, advance, beginning, in, 1967, an, important, modern, edition, by, jacques, jouanna, and, others, began, to, appear, with, greek, text, french, translation, and, commentary, in, the, collection, bud, other, important, bilingual, annotated, editions, with, translation, in, german, or, french, continue, to, appear, in, the, corpus, medicorum, graecorum, published, by, the, berlin, brandenburgische, akademie, der, wissenschaften, the, first, english, translation, from, the, hippocratic, corpus, peter, lowe, s, chirurgerie, surgery, was, published, in, 1597, but, a, complete, english, translation, of, a, dozen, and, a, half, genuine, works, was, not, offered, in, english, until, francis, adams, publication, of, 1849, other, works, of, the, corpus, remained, untranslated, into, english, until, the, resumed, publication, of, the, loeb, classical, library, edition, beginning, in, 1988, the, first, four, loeb, volumes, were, published, in, 1923, 1931, and, seven, further, volumes, between, 1988, and, 2012, ordering, from, adams, 1891, pp, 40, 105, lcl, vols, of, the, loeb, classical, library, edition
