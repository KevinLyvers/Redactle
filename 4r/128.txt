troiae, in, his, poetry, guido, was, an, imitator, of, the, proven, als, but, in, this, book, he, converted, beno, t, de, sainte, maure, s, french, romance, into, what, sounded, like, serious, latin, history, much, the, same, thing, occurred, with, other, great, legends, quilichino, of, spoleto, wrote, couplets, about, the, legend, of, alexander, the, great, europe, was, full, of, the, legend, of,

renaissance, at, the, same, time, epic, poetry, was, written, in, a, mixed, language, a, dialect, of, italian, based, on, french, hybrid, words, exhibited, a, treatment, of, sounds, according, to, the, rules, of, both, languages, had, french, roots, with, italian, endings, and, were, pronounced, according, to, italian, or, latin, rules, examples, include, the, chansons, de, geste, macaire, the, entr, e, d, espagne, written, by, anonymous, of, padua, the, prise, de, pampelune, written, by, niccol, of, verona, and, others, all, this, preceded, the, appearance, of, purely, italian, literature, the, french, and, occitan, languages, gradually, gave, way, to, the, native, italian, hybridism, recurred, but, it, no, longer, predominated, in, the, bovo, d, antona, and, the, rainaldo, e, lesengrino, venetian, is, clearly, felt, although, the, language, is, influenced, by, french, forms, these, writings, which, graziadio, isaia, ascoli, has, called, miste, mixed, immediately, preceded, the, appearance, of, purely, italian, works, there, is, evidence, that, a, type, of, literature, already, existed, before, the, 13th, century, the, ritmo, cassinese, ritmo, di, sant, alessio, laudes, creaturarum, ritmo, lucchese, ritmo, laurenziano, ritmo, bellunese, are, classified, by, cesare, segre, et, al, as, archaic, works, componimenti, arcaici, such, are, labelled, the, first, literary, works, in, the, italian, vernacular, their, dates, ranging, from, the, last, decades, of, the, 12th, century, to, the, early, decades, of, the, 13th, however, as, he, points, out, such, early, literature, does, not, yet, present, any, uniform, stylistic, or, linguistic, traits, this, early, development, however, was, simultaneous, in, the, whole, peninsula, varying, only, in, the, subject, matter, of, the, art, in, the, north, the, poems, of, giacomino, da, verona, and, bonvesin, da, la, riva, were, written, in, a, dialect, of, lombard, and, venetian, this, sort, of, composition, may, have, been, encouraged, by, the, old, custom, in, the, north, of, italy, of, listening, to, the, songs, of, the, jongleurs, the, year, 1230, marked, the, beginning, of, the, sicilian, school, and, of, literature, showing, more, uniform, traits, its, importance, lies, more, in, the, language, the, creation, of, the, first, standard, italian, than, its, subject, a, love, song, partly, modelled, on, the, proven, al, poetry, imported, to, the, south, by, the, normans, and, the, svevs, under, frederick, ii, this, poetry, differs, from, the, french, equivalent, in, its, treatment, of, the, woman, less, erotic, and, more, platonic, a, vein, further, developed, by, dolce, stil, novo, in, later, 13th, century, bologna, and, florence, the, customary, repertoire, of, chivalry, terms, is, adapted, to, italian, phonotactics, creating, new, italian, vocabulary, these, were, adopted, by, dante, and, his, contemporaries, and, handed, on, to, future, generations, of, italian, writers, to, the, sicilian, school, belonged, enzio, king, of, sardinia, pietro, della, vigna, inghilfredi, guido, and, odo, delle, colonne, jacopo, d, aquino, ruggieri, apugliese, giacomo, da, lentini, arrigo, testa, and, others, most, famous, is, io, m, aggio, posto, in, core, by, giacomo, da, lentini, the, head, of, the, movement, but, there, is, also, poetry, written, by, frederick, himself, giacomo, da, lentini, is, also, credited, with, inventing, the, sonnet, a, form, later, perfected, by, dante, petrarch, and, boccaccio, the, censorship, imposed, by, frederick, meant, that, no, political, matter, entered, literary, debate, in, this, respect, the, poetry, of, the, north, still, divided, into, communes, or, city, states, with, relatively, democratic, governments, provided, new, ideas, these, new, ideas, are, shown, in, the, sirventese, genre, and, later, dante, s, commedia, full, of, invectives, against, contemporary, political, leaders, and, popes, though, the, conventional, love, song, prevailed, at, frederick, s, and, later, manfred, s, court, more, spontaneous, poetry, existed, in, the, contrasto, attributed, to, cielo, d, alcamo, the, contrasto, is, probably, a, scholarly, re, elaboration, of, a, lost, popular, rhyme, and, is, the, closest, to, a, type, of, poetry, that, perished, or, was, smothered, by, the, ancient, sicilian, literature, the, poems, of, the, sicilian, school, were, written, in, the, first, known, standard, italian, this, was, elaborated, by, these, poets, under, the, direction, of, frederick, ii, and, combines, many, traits, typical, of, the, sicilian, and, to, a, lesser, extent, apulian, dialects, and, other, southern, dialects, with, many, words, of, latin, and, french, origin, dante, s, styles, illustre, cardinale, aulico, curiale, were, developed, from, his, linguistic, study, of, the, sicilian, school, whose, technical, features, had, been, imported, by, guittone, d, arezzo, in, tuscany, the, standard, changed, slightly, in, tuscany, because, tuscan, scriveners, perceived, the, five, vowel, system, used, by, southern, italians, as, a, seven, vowel, one, as, a, consequence, the, texts, that, italian, students, read, in, their, anthology, contain, lines, that, appear, not, to, rhyme, a, feature, known, as, sicilian, rhyme, rima, siciliana, which, was, widely, used, later, by, poets, such, as, dante, or, petrarch, the, earliest, preserved, sermons, in, the, italian, language, are, from, jordan, of, pisa, a, dominican, francis, of, assisi, the, founder, of, the, franciscans, also, wrote, poetry, according, to, legend, francis, dictated, the, hymn, cantico, del, sole, in, the, eighteenth, year, of, his, penance, it, was, the, first, great, poetical, work, of, northern, italy, written, in, a, type, of, verse, marked, by, assonance, a, poetic, device, more, widespread, in, northern, europe, jacopone, da, todi, was, a, poet, who, represented, the, religious, feeling, that, had, made, special, progress, in, umbria, jacopone, was, possessed, by, st, francis, s, mysticism, but, was, also, a, satirist, who, mocked, the, corruption, and, hypocrisy, of, the, church, the, religious, movement, in, umbria, was, followed, by, another, literary, phenomenon, the, religious, drama, in, 1258, a, hermit, raniero, fasani, represented, himself, as, sent, by, god, to, disclose, mysterious, visions, and, to, announce, to, the, world, terrible, visitations, fasani, s, pronouncements, stimulated, the, formation, of, the, compagnie, di, disciplinanti, who, for, a, penance, scourged, themselves, until, they, drew, blood, and, sang, laudi, in, dialogue, in, their, confraternities, these, laudi, closely, connected, with, the, liturgy, were, the, first, example, of, drama, in, the, vernacular, tongue, of, italy, they, were, written, in, the, umbrian, dialect, in, verses, of, eight, syllables, as, early, as, the, end, of, the, 13th, century, the, devozioni, del, giovedi, e, venerdi, santo, appeared, mixing, liturgy, and, drama, later, di, un, monaco, che, and, al, servizio, di, dio, of, a, monk, who, entered, the, service, of, god, approached, the, definite, form, the, religious, drama, would, assume, in, the, following, centuries, 13th, century, tuscans, spoke, a, dialect, that, closely, resembled, latin, and, afterwards, became, almost, exclusively, the, language, of, literature, and, which, was, already, regarded, at, the, end, of, the, 13th, century, as, surpassing, other, dialects, in, tuscany, too, popular, love, poetry, existed, a, school, of, imitators, of, the, sicilians, was, led, by, dante, da, majano, but, its, literary, originality, took, another, line, that, of, humorous, and, satirical, poetry, the, entirely, democratic, form, of, government, created, a, style, of, poetry, that, stood, strongly, against, the, medieval, mystic, and, chivalrous, style, the, sonnets, of, rustico, di, filippo, are, half, fun, and, half, satire, as, is, the, work, of, cecco, angiolieri, of, siena, the, oldest, known, humorist, another, type, of, poetry, also, began, in, tuscany, guittone, d, arezzo, made, art, quit, chivalry, and, proven, al, forms, for, national, motives, and, latin, forms, he, attempted, political, poetry, and, prepared, the, way, for, the, bolognese, school, bologna, was, the, city, of, science, and, philosophical, poetry, appeared, there, guido, guinizelli,

one, in, particular, al, cor, gentil, to, a, kind, heart, is, considered, the, manifesto, of, the, new, movement, that, bloomed, in, florence, under, cavalcanti, dante, and, their, followers, he, marks, a, great, development, in, the, history, of, italian, art, especially, because, of, his, close, connection, with, dante, s, lyric, poetry, in, the, 13th, century, there, were, several, major, allegorical, poems, one, of, these, is, by, brunetto, latini, his, tesoretto, is, a, short, poem, in, seven, syllable, verses, rhyming, in, couplets, in, which, the, author, is, lost, in, a,

guittone, viewed, his, style, as, very, artistic, but, later, scholars, view, it, as, extravagant, and, grotesque, with, the, school, of, lapo, gianni, guido, cavalcanti, cino, da, pistoia, and, dante, alighieri, lyric, poetry, became, exclusively, tuscan, the, whole, novelty, and, poetic, power, of, this, school, consisted, in, according, to, dante, quando, amore, spira, noto, ed, a, quel, niodo, ch, ei, detta, dentro, vo, significando, that, is, in, a, power, of, expressing, the, feelings, of, the, soul, in, the, way, in, which, love, inspires, them, in, an, appropriate, and, graceful, manner, fitting, form, to, matter, and, by, art, fusing, one, with, the, other, this, a, neo, platonic, approach, widely, endorsed, by, dolce, stil, novo, and, although, in, cavalcanti, s, case, it, can, be, upsetting, and, even, destructive, it, is, nonetheless, a, metaphysical, experience, able, to, lift, man, onto, a, higher, spiritual, dimension, gianni, s, new, style, was, still, influenced, by, the, siculo, proven, al, school, cavalcanti, s, poems, fall, into, two, classes, those, that, portray, the, philosopher, il, sottilissimo, dialettico, as, lorenzo, the, magnificent, called, him, and, those, more, directly, the, product, of, his, poetic, nature, imbued, with, mysticism, and, metaphysics, to, the, first, set, belongs, the, famous, poem, sulla, natura, d, amore, which, in, fact, is, a, treatise, on, amorous, metaphysics, and, was, annotated, later, in, a, learned, way, by, renowned, platonic, philosophers, of, the, 15th, century, such, as, marsilius, ficinus, and, others, on, the, other, hand, in, his, ballate, he, pours, himself, out, ingenuously, but, with, a, consciousness, of, his, art, the, greatest, of, these, is, considered, to, be, the, ballata, composed, by, cavalcanti, when, he, was, banished, from, florence, with, the, party, of, the, bianchi, in, 1300, and, took, refuge, at, sarzana, dante, alighieri, one, of, the, greatest, of, italian, poets, also,

everything, is, sensual, aerial, and, heavenly, and, the, real, beatrice, is, supplanted, by, an, idealized, vision, of, her, losing, her, human, nature, and, becoming, a, representation, of, the,

supreme, end, which, is, god, the, merit, of, the, poem, lies, is, the, individual, art, of, the, poet, the, classic, art, transfused, for, the, first, time, into, a, romance, form, whether, he, describes, nature, analyses, passions, curses, the, vices, or, sings, hymns, to, the, virtues, dante, is, notable, for, the, grandeur, and, delicacy, of, his, art, he, took, the, materials, for, his, poem, from, theology, philosophy, history, and, mythology, but, especially, from, his, own, passions, from, hatred, and, love, the, divine, comedy, ranks, among, the, finest, works, of, world, literature, petrarch, was, the, first, humanist, and, he, was, at, the, same, time, the, first, modern, lyric, poet, his, career, was, long, and, tempestuous, he, lived, for, many, years, at, avignon, cursing, the, corruption, of, the, papal, court, he, travelled, through, nearly, the, whole, of, europe, he, corresponded, with, emperors, and, popes, and, he, was, considered, the, most, important, writer, of, his, time, petrarch, s, lyric, verse, is, quite, different, not, only, from, that, of, the, proven, al, troubadours, and, the, italian, poets, before, him, but, also, from, the, lyrics, of, dante, petrarch, is, a, psychological, poet, who, examines, all, his, feelings, and, renders, them, with, an, art, of, exquisite, sweetness, the, lyrics, of, petrarch, are, no, longer, transcendental, like, dante, s, but, keep, entirely, within, human, limits, the, canzoniere, includes, a, few, political, poems, one, supposed, to, be, addressed, to, cola, di, rienzi, and, several, sonnets, against, the, court, of, avignon, these, are, remarkable, for, their, vigour, of, feeling, and, also, for, showing, that, compared, to, dante, petrarch, had, a, sense, of, a, broader, italian, consciousness, giovanni, boccaccio, had, the, same, enthusiastic, love, of, antiquity, and, the, same, worship, for, the, new, italian, literature, as, petrarch, he, was, the, first, to, put, together, a, latin, translation, of, the, iliad, and, in, 1375, the, odyssey, his, classical, learning, was, shown, in, the, work, de, genealogia, deorum, as, a, h, heeren, said, it, is, an, encyclopaedia, of, mythological, knowledge, and, it, was, the, precursor, of, the, humanist, movement, of, the, 15th, century, boccaccio, was, also, the, first, historian, of, women, in, his, de, mulieribus, claris, and, the, first, to, tell, the, story, of, the, great, unfortunates, in, his, de, casibus, virorum, illustrium, he, continued, and, perfected, former, geographical, investigations, in, his, de, montibus, silvis, fontibus, lacubus, fluminibus, stagnis, et, paludibus, et, de, nominibus, maris, for, which, he, made, use, of, vibius, sequester, he, did, not, invent, the, octave, stanza, but, was, the, first, to, use, it, in, a, work, of, length, and, artistic, merit, his, teseide, the, oldest, italian, romantic, poem, the, filostrato, relates, the, loves, of, troiolo, and, griseida, troilus, and, cressida, the, ninfale, fiesolano, tells, the, love, story, of, the, nymph, mesola, and, the, shepherd, africo, the, amorosa, visione, a, poem, in, triplets, doubtless, owed, its, origin, to, the, divine, comedy, the, ameto, is, a, mixture, of, prose, and, poetry, and, is, the, first, italian, pastoral, romance, boccaccio, became, famous, principally, for, the, italian, work, decamerone, a, collection, of, a, hundred, novels, related, by, a, party, of, men, and, women, who, retired, to, a, villa, near, florence, to, escape, the, plague, in, 1348, novel, writing, so, abundant, in, the, preceding, centuries, especially, in, france, now, for, the, first, time, assumed, an, artistic, shape, the, style, of, boccaccio, tends, to, the, imitation, of, latin, but, in, him, prose, first, took, the, form, of, elaborated, art, over, and, above, this, in, the, decamerone, boccaccio, is, a, delineator, of, character, and, an, observer, of, passions, much, has, been, written, about, the, sources, of, the, novels, of, the, decamerone, probably, boccaccio, made, use, both, of, written, and, of, oral, sources, fazio, degli, uberti, and, federico, frezzi, were, imitators, of, the, divine, comedy, but, only, in, its, external, form, giovanni, fiorentino, wrote, under, the, title, of, pecorone, a, collection, of, tales, which, are, supposed, to, have, been, related, by, a, monk, and, a, nun, in, the, parlour, of, the, monastery, novelists, of, forli, he, closely, imitated, boccaccio, and, drew, on, villani, s, chronicle, for, his, historical, stories, franco, sacchetti, wrote, tales, too, for, the, most, part, on, subjects, taken, from, florentine, history, the, subjects, are, almost, always, improper, but, it, is, evident, that, sacchetti, collected, these, anecdotes, so, he, could, draw, his, own, conclusions, and, moral, reflections, which, he, puts, at, the, end, of, each, story, from, this, point, of, view, sacchetti, s, work, comes, near, to, the, monalisaliones, of, the, middle, ages, a, third, novelist, was, giovanni, sercambi, of, lucca, who, after, 1374, wrote, a, book, in, imitation, of, boccaccio, about, a, party, of, people, who, were, supposed, to, fly, from, a, plague, and, to, go, travelling, about, in, different, italian, cities, stopping, here, and, there, telling, stories, later, but, important, names, are, those, of, masuccio, salernitano, tommaso, guardato, who, wrote, the, novellino, and, antonio, cornazzano, whose, proverbii, became, extremely, popular, chronicles, formerly, believed, to, have, been, of, the, 13th, century, are, now, mainly, regarded, as, forgeries, at, the, end, of, the, 13th, century, there, is, a, chronicle, by, dino, compagni, probably, authentic, giovanni, villani, born, in, 1300, was, more, of, a, chronicler, than, a, historian, he, relates, the, events, up, to, 1347, the, journeys, that, he, made, in, italy, and, france, and, the, information, thus, acquired, mean, that, his, chronicle, the, historie, fiorentine, covers, events, all, over, europe, matteo, was, the, brother, of, giovanni, villani, and, continued, the, chronicle, up, to, 1363, it, was, again, continued, by, filippo, villani, st, catherine, of, siena, s, mysticism, was, political, she, aspired, to, bring, back, the, church, of, rome, to, evangelical, virtue, and, left, a, collection, of, letters, written, to, all, types, of, people, including, popes, another, sienese, giovanni, colombini, founder, of, the, order, of, jesuati, preached, poverty, by, precept, and, example, going, back, to, the, religious, idea, of, st, francis, of, assisi, his, letters, are, among, the, most, remarkable, in, the, category, of, ascetic, works, in, the, 14th, century, bianco, da, siena, wrote, several, religiously, inspired, poems, lauda, that, were, popular, in, the, middle, ages, jacopo, passavanti, in, his, specchio, della, vera, penitenza, attached, instruction, to, narrative, domenico, cavalca, translated, from, the, latin, the, vite, de, santi, padri, rivalta, left, behind, him, many, sermons, and, franco, sacchetti, the, famous, novelist, many, discourses, on, the, whole, there, is, no, doubt, that, one, of, the, most, important, productions, of, the, italian, spirit, of, the, 14th, century, was, religious, literature, humorous, poetry, largely, developed, in, the, 13th, century, was, carried, on, in, the, 14th, by, bindo, bonichi, arrigo, di, castruccio, cecco, nuccoli, andrea, orcagna, lippo, pasci, de, bardi, adriano, de, rossi, antonio, pucci, and, other, lesser, writers, orcagna, was, especially, comic, bonichi, was, comic, with, a, satirical, and, moral, purpose, pucci, was, superior, to, all, of, them, for, the, variety, of, his, production, many, poets, of, the, 14th, century, produced, political, works, fazio, degli, uberti, the, author, of, dittamondo, who, wrote, a, serventese, to, the, lords, and, people, of, italy, a, poem, on, rome, and, a, fierce, invective, against, charles, iv, deserves, notice, as, do, francesco, di, vannozzo, frate, stoppa, de, bostichi, and, matteo, frescobaldi, it, may, be, said, in, general, that, following, the, example, of, petrarch, many, writers, devoted, themselves, to, patriotic, poetry, from, this, period, also, dates, that, literary, phenomenon, known, under, the, name, of, petrarchism, the, petrarchists, or, those, who, sang, of, love, imitating, petrarch, s, manner, were, found, already, in, the, 14th, century, but, others, treated, the, same, subject, with, more, originality, in, a, manner, that, might, be, called, semi, popular, such, were, the, ballate, of, ser, giovanni, fiorentino, of, franco, sacchetti, of, niccol, soldanieri, and, of, guido, and, bindo, donati, ballate, were, poems, sung, to, dancing, and, we, have, very, many, songs, for, the, music, of, the, 14th, century, we, have, already, stated, that, antonio, pucci, versified, villani, s, chronicle, it, is, enough, to, notice, a, chronicle, of, arezzo, in, terza, rima, by, bartolomeo, sinigardi, and, the, history, also, in, terza, rima, of, the, journey, of, pope, alexander, iii, to, venice, by, pier, de, natali, besides, this, every, type, of, subject, whether, history, tragedy, or, husbandry, was, treated, in, verse, neri, di, landocio, wrote, a, life, of, st, catherine, jacopo, gradenigo, called, il, belletto, put, the, gospels, into, triplets, renaissance, humanism, developed, during, the, 14th, and, the, beginning, of, the, 15th, centuries, and, was, a, response, to, the, challenge, of, medi, val, scholastic, education, emphasizing, practical, pre, professional, and, scientific, studies, scholasticism, focused, on, preparing, men, to, be, doctors, lawyers, or, professional, theologians, and, was, taught, from, approved, textbooks, in, logic, natural, philosophy, medicine, law, and, theology, the, main, centers, of, humanism, were, florence, and, naples, rather, than, train, professionals, in, jargon, and, strict, practice, humanists, sought, to, create, a, citizenry, including, sometimes, women, able, to, speak, and, write, with, eloquence, and, clarity, this, was, to, be, accomplished, through, the, study, of, the, studia, humanitatis, today, known, as, the, humanities, grammar, rhetoric, history, poetry, and, moral, philosophy, early, humanists, such, as, petrarch, coluccio, salutati, and, leonardo, bruni, were, great, collectors, of, antique, manuscripts, in, italy, the, humanist, educational, program, won, rapid, acceptance, and, by, the, mid, 15th, century, many, of, the, upper, classes, had, received, humanist, educations, there, were, five, 15th, century, humanist, popes, one, of, whom, aeneas, silvius, piccolomini, pius, ii, was, a, prolific, author, and, wrote, a, treatise, on, the, education, of, boys, leone, battista, alberti, the, learned, greek, and, latin, scholar, wrote, in, the, vernacular, and, vespasiano, da, bisticci, while, he, was, constantly, absorbed, in, greek, and, latin, manuscripts, wrote, the, vite, di, uomini, illustri, valuable, for, their, historical, contents, and, rivalling, the, best, works, of, the, 14th, century, in, their, candour, and, simplicity, andrea, da, barberino, wrote, the, beautiful, prose, of, the, reali, di, francia, giving, a, coloring, of, romanit, to, the, chivalrous, romances, belcari, and, girolamo, benivieni, returned, to, the, mystic, idealism, of, earlier, times, but, it, is, in, cosimo, de, medici, and, lorenzo, de, medici, from, 1430, to, 1492, that, the, influence, of, florence, on, the, renaissance, is, particularly, seen, lorenzo, de, medici, gave, to, his, poetry, the, colors, of, the, most, pronounced, realism, as, well, as, of, the, loftiest, idealism, who, passes, from, the, platonic, sonnet, to, the, impassioned, triplets, of, the, amori, di, venere, from, the, grandiosity, of, the, salve, to, nencia, and, to, beoni, from, the, canto, carnascialesco, to, the, lauda, next, to, lorenzo, comes, poliziano, who, also, united, and, with, greater, art, the, ancient, and, the, modern, the, popular, and, the, classical, style, in, his, rispetti, and, in, his, ballate, the, freshness, of, imagery, and, the, plasticity, of, form, are, inimitable, a, great, greek, scholar, poliziano, wrote, italian, verses, with, dazzling, colours, the, purest, elegance, of, the, greek, sources, pervaded, his, art, in, all, its, varieties, in, the, orfeo, as, well, as, the, stanze, per, la, giostra, a, completely, new, style, of, poetry, arose, the, canto, carnascialesco, these, were, a, type, of, choral, songs, which, were, accompanied, by, symbolic, masquerades, common, in, florence, at, the, carnival, they, were, written, in, a, metre, like, that, of, the, ballate, and, for, the, most, part, they, were, put, into, the, mouth, of, a, party, of, workmen, and, tradesmen, who, with, not, very, chaste, allusions, sang, the, praises, of, their, art, these, triumphs, and, masquerades, were, directed, by, lorenzo, himself, in, the, evening, there, set, out, into, the, city, large, companies, on, horseback, playing, and, singing, these, songs, there, are, some, by, lorenzo, himself, which, surpass, all, the, others, in, their, mastery, of, art, that, entitled, bacco, ed, arianna, is, the, most, famous, italy, did, not, yet, have, true, epic, poetry, but, had, however, many, poems, called, cantari, because, they, contained, stories, that, were, sung, to, the, people, and, besides, there, were, romantic, poems, such, as, the, buovo, d, antona, the, regina, ancroja, and, others, but, the, first, to, introduce, life, into, this, style, was, luigi, pulci, who, wrote, the, morgante, maggiore, the, material, of, the, morgante, is, almost, completely, taken, from, an, obscure, chivalrous, poem, of, the, 15th, century, rediscovered, by, pio, rajna, pulci, erected, a, structure, of, his, own, often, turning, the, subject, into, ridicule, burlesquing, the, characters, and, introducing, many, digressions, now, capricious, now, scientific, now, theological, pulci, raised, the, romantic, epic, into, a, work, of, art, and, united, the, serious, and, the, comic, with, a, more, serious, intention, matteo, boiardo, count, of, scandiano, wrote, his, orlando, innamorato, in, which, he, seems, to, have, aspired, to, embrace, the, whole, range, of, carolingian, legends, but, he, did, not, complete, his, task, a, third, romantic, poem, of, the, 15th, century, was, the, mambriano, by, francesco, bello, cieco, of, ferrara, he, drew, from, the, carolingian, cycle, from, the, romances, of, the, round, table, and, from, classical, antiquity, gioviano, pontano, wrote, the, history, of, naples, leonardo, bruni, of, arezzo,

florence, and, attached, itself, to, certain, popular, festivities, that, were, usually, held, in, honor, of, st, john, the, baptist, patron, saint, of, the, city, the, sacra, rappresentazione, is, the, development, of, the, medieval, mistero, mystery, play, although, it, belonged, to, popular, poetry, some, of, its, authors, were, literary, men, from, the, 15th, century, some, element, of, the, comic, profane, found, its, way, into, the, sacra, rappresentazione, from, its, biblical, and, legendary, conventionalism, poliziano, emancipated, himself, in, his, orfeo, which, although, in, its, exterior, form, belonging, to, the, sacred, representations, yet, substantially, detaches, itself, from, them, in, its, contents, and, in, the, artistic, element, introduced, the, fundamental, characteristic, of, the, literary, epoch, following, that, of, the, renaissance, is, that, it, perfected, itself, in, every, type, of, art, in, particular, uniting, the, essentially, italian, character, of, its, language, with, the, classicism, of, style, this, period, lasted, from, about, 1494, to, about, 1560, 1494, being, when, charles, viii, descended, into, italy, marking, the, beginning, of, italy, s, foreign, domination, and, political, decadence, literary, activity, that, appeared, from, the, end, of, the, 15th, century, to, the, middle, of, the, 16th, century, was, the, product, of, the, political, and, social, conditions, of, an, earlier, age, baldassare, castiglione, wrote, il, cortegiano, or, the, book, of, the, courtier, a, courtesy, book, dealing, with, questions, of, the, etiquette, and, morality, of, the, courtier, published, in, 1528, it, was, very, influential, in, 16th, century, european, court, circles, the, book, of, the, courtier, is, a, lengthy, philosophical, dialogue, on, the, topic, of, what, constitutes, an, ideal, courtier, or, in, the, third, chapter, court, lady, worthy, to, befriend, and, advise, a, prince, or, political, leader, inspired, by, the, spanish, court, during, his, time, as, ambassador, of, the, holy, see, 1524, 1529, castiglione, set, the, narrative, of, the, book, in, his, years, as, a, courtier, in, his, native, duchy, of, urbino, the, book, quickly, became, enormously, popular, and, was, assimilated, by, its, readers, into, the, genre, of, prescriptive, courtesy, books, or, books, of, manners, dealing, with, issues, of, etiquette, self, presentation, and, morals, particularly, at, princely, or, royal, courts, books, such, as, giovanni, della, casa, s, galateo, 1558, and, stefano, guazzo, s, the, civil, conversation, 1574, the, book, of, the, courtier, was, much, more, than, that, however, having, the, character, of, a, drama, an, open, ended, philosophical, discussion, and, an, essay, it, has, also, been, seen, as, a, veiled, political, allegory, niccol, machiavelli, and, francesco, guicciardini, were, the, chief, originators, of, the, science, of, history, machiavelli, s, principal, works, are, the, istorie, fiorentine, the, discorsi, sulla, prima, deca, di, tito, livio, the, arte, della, guerra, and, the, principe, his, merit, consists, in, having, emphasized, the, experimental, side, of, the, study, of, political, action, by, having, observed, facts, studied, histories, and, drawn, principles, from, them, his, history, is, sometimes, inexact, in, facts, it, is, rather, a, political, than, a, historical, work, guicciardini, was, very, observant, and, endeavoured, to, reduce, his, observations, to, a, science, his, storia, d, italia, which, extends, from, the, death, of, lorenzo, de, medici, to, 1534, is, full, of, political, wisdom, is, skillfully, arranged, in, its, parts, gives, a, lively, picture, of, the, character, of, the, persons, it, treats, of, and, is, written, in, a, grand, style, machiavelli, and, guicciardini, may, be, considered, distinguished, historians, as, well, as, originators, of, the, science, of, history, founded, on, observation, inferior, to, them, were, jacopo, nardi, a, just, and, faithful, historian, and, a, virtuous, man, who, defended, the, rights, of, florence, against, the, medici, before, charles, v, benedetto, varchi, giambattista, adriani, bernardo, segni, and, outside, tuscany, camillo, porzio, who, related, the, congiura, de, baroni, and, the, history, of, italy, from, 1547, to, 1552, angelo, di, costanzo, pietro, bembo, paolo, paruta, and, others, ludovico, ariosto, s, orlando, furioso, was, a, continuation, of, boiardo, s, innamorato, his, characteristic, is, that, he, assimilated, the, romance, of, chivalry, into, the, style, and, models, of, classicism, romantic, ariosto, was, an, artist, only, for, the, love, of, his, art, his, epic, pietro, bembo, was, an, influential, figure, in, the, development, of, the, italian, language, specifically, tuscan, as, a, literary, medium, and, his, writings, assisted, in, the, 16th, century, revival, of, interest, in, the, works, of, petrarch, as, a, writer, bembo, attempted, to, restore, some, of, the, legendary, effect, that, ancient, greek, had, on, its, hearers, but, in, tuscan, italian, instead, he, held, as, his, model, and, as, the, highest, example, of, poetic, expression, ever, achieved, in, italian, the, work, of, petrarch, and, boccaccio, two, 14th, century, writers, he, assisted, in, bringing, back, into, fashion, in, the, prose, della, volgar, lingua, he, set, petrarch, up, as, the, perfect, model, and, discussed, verse, composition, in, detail, the, historians, of, italian, literature, are, in, doubt, whether, torquato, tasso, should, be, placed, in, the, period, of, the, highest, development, of, the, renaissance, or, whether, he, should, form, a, period, by, himself, intermediate, between, that, and, the, one, following, in, rinaldo, he, tried, to, reconcile, the, aristotelian, rules, with, the, variety, of, ariosto, he, later, wrote, the, aminta, a, pastoral, drama, he, explains, his, intentions, in, the, three, discorsi, written, while, he, composed, the, gerusalemme, he, would, choose, a, great, and, wonderful, subject, not, so, ancient, as, to, have, lost, all, interest, nor, so, recent, as, to, prevent, the, poet, from, embellishing, it, with, invented, circumstances, he, would, treat, it, rigorously, according, to, the, rules, of, the, unity, of, action, observed, in, greek, and, latin, poems, but, with, a, far, greater, variety, and, splendour, of, episodes, the, gerusalemme, is, the, best, heroic, poem, of, italy, as, regards, the, style, however, although, tasso, studiously, endeavoured, to, keep, close, to, the, classical, models, he, makes, excessive, use, of, metaphor, of, antithesis, of, far, fetched, conceits, and, it, is, especially, from, this, point, of, view, that, some, historians, have, placed, tasso, in, the, literary, period, generally, known, under, the, name, of, secentismo, and, that, others, more, moderate, in, their, criticism, have, said, that, he, prepared, the, way, for, it, meanwhile, there, was, an, attempt, at, the, historical, epic, gian, giorgio, trissino, of, vicenza, composed, a, poem, called, italia, liberata, dai, goti, on, the, campaigns, of, belisarius, he, said, that, he, had, forced, himself, to, observe, all, the, rules, of, aristotle, and, that, he, had, imitated, homer, monsignore, giovanni, guidiccioni, of, lucca, in, sonnets, expressed, his, grief, for, the, sad, state, of, his, country, other, lyric, poets, of, the, period, include, francesco, molza, giovanni, della, casa, and, pietro, bembo, and, women, vittoria, colonna, veronica, gambara, tullia, d, aragona, and, giulia, gonzaga, isabella, di, morra, is, a, singular, example, of, female, poetry, of, the, time, many, tragedies, were, written, in, the, 16th, century, but, they, are, all, weak, the, first, to, occupy, the, tragic, stage, was, trissino, with, his, sofonisba, the, oreste, and, the, rosmunda, of, giovanni, di, bernardo, rucellai, were, no, better, nor, luigi, alamanni, s, translation, of, antigone, sperone, speroni, in, his, canace, and, giraldi, cintio, in, his, orbecche, tried, to, become, innovators, in, tragic, literature, but, provoked, criticisms, of, grotesquerie, and, debate, over, the, role, of, decorum, they, were, often, seen, as, inferior, to, the, torrismondo, of, torquato, tasso, especially, remarkable, for, the, choruses, reminiscent, of, the, greek, tragedies, the, italian, comedy, of, the, 16th, century, was, almost, entirely, modelled, on, latin, comedy, they, were, almost, always, alike, in, the, plot, thus, the, lucidi, of, agnolo, firenzuola, and, the, vecchio, amoroso, of, donato, giannotti, were, modelled, on, comedies, by, plautus, as, were, the, sporta, by, giambattista, gelli, the, marito, by, lodovico, dolce, and, others, the, best, comedy, writers, were, machiavelli, ariosto, and, giovanni, maria, cecchi, and, possibly, pietro, aretino, the, 15th, century, included, humorous, poetry, antonio, cammelli, surnamed, the, pistoian, is, especially, deserving, of, notice, because, of, his, pungent, bonhomie, as, sainte, beuve, called, it, but, it, was, francesco, berni, who, and, satire, carried, this, type, of, literature, to, perfection, in, the, 16th, century, from, him, the, style, has, been, called, bernesque, poetry, bernesque, poetry, is, the, clearest, reflection, of, that, religious, and, moral, scepticism, that, was, a, characteristic, of, italian, social, life, in, the, 16th, century, and, that, showed, itself, in, most, of, the, works, of, that, period, a, scepticism, that, stopped, the, religious, reformation, in, italy, and, which, in, its, turn, was, an, effect, of, historical, conditions, pure, satirists, on, the, other, hand, were, antonio, vinciguerra, lodovico, alamanni, and, ariosto, the, last, superior, to, the, others, for, the, attic, elegance, of, his, style, in, the, 16th, century, there, were, not, a, few, didactic, works, in, his, poem, le, api, giovanni, di, bernardo, rucellai, approaches, the, perfection, of, virgil, the, most, important, didactic, work, however, is, castiglione, s, cortigiano, in, which, he, imagines, a, discussion, in, the, palace, of, the, dukes, of, urbino, between, knights, and, ladies, as, to, what, gifts, a, perfect, courtier, requires, this, book, is, valuable, as, an, illustration, of, the, intellectual, and, moral, state, of, the, highest, italian, society, in, the, first, half, of, the, 16th, century, of, the, novelists, of, the, 16th, century, the, two, most, important, were, grazzini, and, matteo, bandello, bandello, was, a, dominican, friar, and, a, bishop, but, that, notwithstanding, his, novels, were, very, loose, in, subject, and, he, often, held, up, the, ecclesiastics, of, his, time, to, ridicule, among, the, very, numerous, translations, of, the, time, those, of, the, aeneid, and, of, the, pastorals, of, longus, the, sophist, by, annibale, caro, are, still, famous, as, are, also, the, translations, of, ovid, s, metamorphoses, by, giovanni, andrea, dell, anguillara, of, apuleius, s, the, golden, ass, by, firenzuola, and, of, plutarch, s, lives, and, moralia, by, marcello, adriani, the, treaty, of, cateau, cambr, sis, in, 1559, ushered, in, centuries, of, foreign, domination, over, italy, this, period, is, known, in, the, history, of, italian, literature, as, the, secentismo, its, writers, deployed, complex, far, fetched, comparisons, paradoxes, and, paralogical, statements, acutezze, in, order, to, exhibit, the, writer, s, genius, and, ingenuity, ingegno, and, provoke, wonder, meraviglia, in, the, reader, the, main, theorist, of, italian, secentismo, was, the, philosopher, emanuele, tesauro, his, main, work, was, il, cannocchiale, aristotelico, first, published, in, 1654, and, reprinted, at, least, ten, times, in, the, 17th, century, developing, ideas, adumbrated, in, renaissance, poetics, and, using, the, aristotle, of, the, rhetoric, rather, than, of, the, poetics, tesauro, builds, up, a, vast, theory, of, metaphor, and, concettismo, his, theory, depends, on, a, distinction, between, intelletto, and, ingegno, intelletto, apprehends, facts, and, communicates, them, via, literal, signs, directly, and, unadorned, to, the, mind, ingegno, apprehends, facts, and, transforms, them, through, processes, of, analogy, and, lateral, thinking, into, pleasing, witty, rhetorical, conceits, tesauro, is, conscious, of, the, dangers, of, slippage, between, truth, and, language, but, he, appreciates, the, sensuous, and, intellectual, pleasure, and, wonder, that, non, literal, non, transparent, words, and, signs, can, create, for, him, all, language, is, inherently, metaphorical, in, that, it, involves, transference, from, thought, to, the, senses, the, role, of, ingegno, is, to, investigate, the, hidden, connection, between, all, things, treating, the, world, as, a, storehouse, of, potentially, marvellous, analogies, metaphor, is, central, to, this, metamorphosing, process, and, tesauro, shows, how, in, kaleidoscopic, fashion, one, metaphor, can, generate, an, infinite, number, of, others, in, such, a, way, that, the, scope, of, poetic, and, rhetorical, analogy, is, extended, in, theory, as, never, before, in, this, way, he, subverts, aristotle, while, paying, lip, service, to, him, and, opens, up, a, new, literary, world, which, is, akin, to, the, new, scientific, and, geographical, worlds, of, the, early, 17th, century, at, the, head, of, the, school, of, the, secentisti, was, giambattista, marino, especially, known, for, his, epic, poem, l, adone, marino, himself, as, he, declared, in, the, preface, to, la, lira, wished, to, be, a, new, leader, and, model, for, other, poets, second, he, wished, to, surprise, and, shock, the, reader, through, the, marvellous, meraviglioso, and, the, unusual, peregrino, the, qualities, he, and, his, followers, most, valued, were, ingegno, and, acutezza, as, demonstrated, through, far, fetched, metaphors, and, conceits, often, ones, that, would, assault, the, reader, s, senses, this, meant, being, ready, in, fact, eager, to, break, literary, rules, and, precepts, marino, and, his, followers, mixed, tradition, and, innovation, they, worked, with, existing, poetic, forms, notably, the, sonnet, the, sestina, the, canzone, the, madrigal, and, less, frequently, the, ottava, rima, but, developed, new, more, fluid, structures, and, line, lengths, they, also, treated, hallowed, themes, love, woman, nature, but, they, made, the, senses, and, sensuality, the, dominant, element, the, passions, which, had, attracted, the, attention, of, paduan, writers, and, theorists, in, the, mid, 16th, century, as, well, as, of, tasso, take, centre, stage, and, are, depicted, in, extreme, forms, in, representations, of, subjects, such, as, martyrdom, sacrifice, heroic, grandeur, and, abysmal, existential, fear, the, marinists, also, take, up, new, themes, notably, the, visual, and, musical, arts, and, indoor, scenes, with, a, new, repertoire, of, references, embracing, modern, scientific, advances, other, specialized, branches, of, knowledge, and, exotic, locations, and, animals, there, are, similarities, with, tasso, but, the, balance, between, form, and, content, in, tasso, is, deliberately, unbalanced, by, marino, and, his, followers, who, very, often, forget, all, concerns, about, unity, in, their, poems, witness, the, adone, the, most, striking, difference, however, is, the, intensified, role, of, metaphor, marino, and, his, followers, looked, for, metaphors, that, would, arrest, the, reader, by, suggesting, a, likeness, between, two, apparently, disparate, things, thus, producing, startling, metamorphoses, conceits, concetti, and, far, fetched, images, that, send, sparks, flying, as, they, create, a, friction, between, two, apparently, diverse, objects, the, extent, to, which, this, new, metaphorical, freedom, reveals, a, new, world, is, still, open, to, critical, debate, in, some, ways, it, seems, to, make, poetry, a, form, of, intellectual, game, or, puzzle, in, others, it, suggests, new, ways, of, perceiving, and, describing, reality, parallel, to, the, mathematical, measures, emloyed, by, galileo, and, his, followers, in, the, experimental, sciences, almost, all, the, poets, of, the, 17th, century, were, more, or, less, influenced, by, marinism, many, secentisti, felt, the, influence, of, another, poet, gabriello, chiabrera, enamoured, of, the, greeks, he, made, new, metres, especially, in, imitation, of, pindar, treating, of, religious, moral, historical, and, amatory, subjects, carlo, alessandro, guidi, was, the, chief, representative, of, an, early, pindarizing, current, based, on, imitation, of, chiabrera, as, second, only, to, petrarch, in, italian, poetry, he, was, extolled, by, both, gravina, and, crescimbeni, who, edited, his, poetry, 1726, and, imitated, by, parini, alfieri, attributed, his, own, self, discovery, to, the, power, of, guidi, s, verse, fulvio, testi, was, another, major, exponent, of, the, hellenizing, strand, of, baroque, classicism, combining, horatianism, with, the, imitation, of, anacreon, and, pindar, his, most, important, and, interesting, writings, are, not, however, his, lyrics, only, collected, in, 1653, but, his, extensive, correspondence, which, is, a, major, document, of, baroque, politics, and, letters, marino, s, work, with, its, sensual, metaphorical, language, and, its, non, epic, structure, and, morality, stirred, up, a, debate, over, the, rival, claims, of, classical, purity, and, sobriety, on, the, one, hand, and, the, excesses, of, marinism, on, the, other, the, debate, went, on, until, it, was, finally, decided, in, favour, of, the, classical, by, the, accademia, dell, arcadia, whose, view, of, the, matter, prevailed, in, italian, criticism, well, into, the, 20th, century, the, accademia, dell, arcadia, was, founded, by, giovanni, mario, crescimbeni, and, gian, vincenzo, gravina, in, 1690, the, arcadia, was, so, called, because, its, chief, aim, was, to, imitate, the, simplicity, of, the, ancient, shepherds, who, were, supposed, to, have, lived, in, arcadia, in, the, golden, age, the, poems, of, the, arcadians, are, made, up, of, sonnets, madrigals, canzonette, and, blank, verse, the, one, who, most, distinguished, himself, among, the, sonneteers, was, felice, zappi, among, the, authors, of, songs, paolo, rolli, was, illustrious, carlo, innocenzo, frugoni, was, the, best, known, the, members, of, the, arcadia, were, almost, exclusively, men, but, at, least, one, woman, maria, antonia, scalera, stellini, was, elected, on, poetical, merits, vincenzo, da, filicaja, had, a, lyric, talent, particularly, in, the, songs, about, vienna, besieged, by, the, turks, during, the, 17th, century, italy, witnessed, the, development, of, the, baroque, novel, which, alberto, asor, rosa, has, suggested, came, about, through, the, secularization, of, chivalric, poetry, and, the, increasingly, literary, character, of, the, novella, there, were, a, few, developments, in, other, directions, giovanni, ambrogio, marini, presented, an, idealization, of, aristocratic, life, in, his, highly, successful, calloandro, fedele, 1640, 1, and, in,

reworked, in, i, giuochi, di, fortuna, 1655, pace, pasini, s, l, historia, del, cavalier, perduto, 1644, which, combines, chivalric, picaresque, and, political, themes, was, likely, a, source, for,

neapolitan, italian, painter, and, poet, salvator, rosa, whose, seven, long, satires, follow, in, the, footsteps, of, ariosto, arcadians, such, as, gian, vincenzo, gravina, and, paolo, rolli, used,

ushered, in, a, genre, continued, by, the, sienese, playwright, girolamo, gigli, the, philosopher, theologian, astrologer, and, poet, tommaso, campanella, is, an, interesting, albeit, isolated, figure, in, 17th, century, italian, literature, his, poesie, published, in, 1622, consist, of, eighty, nine, poems, in, various, metrical, forms, some, are, autobiographical, but, all, are, stamped, with, a, seriousness, and, directness, which, bypasses, the, literary, fashions, of, his, day, he, wrote, in, latin, on, dialectics, rhetoric, poetics, and, historiography, as, well, as, the, italian, del, senso, delle, cose, e, della, magia, composed, in, 1604, and, published, in, 1620, in, this, fascinating, work, influenced, by, the, teachings, of, bernardino, telesio, campanella, imagines, the, world, as, a, living, statue, of, god, in, which, all, aspects, of, reality, have, meaning, and, sense, with, its, animism, and, sensuality, this, vision, foreshadows, in, many, ways, the, views, of, daniello, bartoli, and, tesauro, campanella, s, theological, work, closely, connected, with, his, philosophical, writings, includes, the, atheismus, triumphatus, and, the, thirty, volume, theologia, 1613, 24, his, most, famous, work, and, the, one, that, brings, together, all, his, interests, is, la, citt, del, sole, first, drafted, in, 1602, in, italian, and, then, later, translated, into, latin, in, 1613, and, 1631, in, it, a, genoese, sailor, from, christopher, columbus, crew, describes, the, ideal, state, of, the, city, of, the, sun, ruled, over, in, both, temporal, and, spiritual,

are, links, here, with, the, burgeoning, modernism, of, the, querelle, des, anciens, et, des, modernes, and, with, the, methods, and, scientific, aspirations, of, galileo, whom, campanella, defended, in, writing, in, 1616, the, lyncean, academy, the, first, and, most, famous, of, the, scientific, academies, in, italy, was, founded, in, 1603, in, rome, by, federico, cesi, the, academy, dedicated, its, activities, to, the, study, of, the, natural, and, mathematical, sciences, and, to, the, use, of, the, experimental, method, associated, with, galileo, the, european, dimension, of, the, academy, was, characteristic, of, the, founders, foresight, and, perspective, elections, were, made, of, foreign, corresponding, members, a, practice, that, continues, to, this, day, members, included,

publishing, of, scientific, results, based, on, direct, observation, including, galileo, s, work, on, the, moon, s, surface, 1610, and, his, assayer, 1623, the, academy, defended, galileo, at, his, trial, in, 1616, and, played, a, crucial, role, in, the, early, diffusion, and, promotion, of, his, method, the, successor, of, the, lynceans, was, the, accademia, del, cimento, founded, in, florence, in, 1657, never, as, organized, as, the, lynceans, had, been, it, began, as, a, meeting, of, disciples, of, galileo, all, of, whom, were, interested, in, the, progress, of, the, experimental, sciences, official, status, came, in, 1657, when, cardinal, leopoldo, de, medici, sponsored, the, academy, s, foundation, with, the, motto, provando, e, riprovando, the, members, including, carlo, roberto, dati, lorenzo, magalotti, and, vincenzo, viviani, set, seriously, about, their, work, unlike, galileo, who, tackled, large, scale, issues, the, cimento, worked, on, a, smaller, scale, one, of, the, legacies, of, the, cimento, is, the, elegant, italian, prose, capable, of, describing, things, accurately, that, characterizes, the, saggi, di, naturali, esperienze, edited, by, magalotti, and, published, in, 1667, galileo, occupied, a, conspicuous, place, in, the, history, of, letters, a, devoted, student, of, ariosto, he, seemed, to, transfuse, into, his, prose, the, qualities, of, that, great, poet, clear, and, frank, freedom, of, expression, precision, and, ease, and, at, the, same, time, elegance, paganino, bonafede, in, the, tesoro, dei, rustici, gave, many, precepts, in,

translated, and, adapted, internationally, numerous, times, the, leading, figure, of, the, literary, revival, of, the, 18th, century, was, giuseppe, parini, in, a, collection, of, poems, he, published, at, twenty, three, years, of, age, under, the, name, of, ripano, eupilino, the, poet, shows, his, faculty, of, taking, his, scenes, from, real, life, and, in, his, satirical, pieces, he, exhibits, a, spirit, of, outspoken, opposition, to, his, own, times, improving, on, the, poems, of, his, youth, he, showed, himself, an, innovator, in, his, lyrics, rejecting, at, once, petrarchism, secentismo, and, arcadia, in, the, odi, the, satirical, note, is, already, heard, but, it, comes, out, more, strongly, in, del, giorno, which, assumes, major, social, and, historical, value, as, an,

a, little, hard, and, broken, as, a, protest, against, the, arcadian, monotony, in, the, second, half, of, the, 18th, century, the, italian, language, was, especially, full, of, french, expressions, a, question, arose, about, purism, of, language, prose, needed, to, be, restored, for, the, sake, of, national, dignity, and, it, was, believed, that, this, could, not, be, done, except, by, going, back, to, the, writers, of, the, 14th, century, to, the, aurei, trecentisti, as, they, were, called, or, else, to, the, classics, of, italian, literature, one, of, the, promoters, of, the, new, school, was, antonio, cesari, who, republished, ancient, authors, and, brought, out, a, new, edition, with, additions, of, the, vocabolario, della, crusca, he, wrote, a, dissertation, sopra, lo, stato, presente, della, lingua, italiana, and, endeavoured, to, establish, the, supremacy, of, tuscan, and, of, dante, petrarch, and, boccaccio, to, this, tuscan, supremacy, proclaimed, and, upheld, by, cesari, there, was, opposed, a, lombard, school, which, with, dante, s, de, vulgari, eloquentia, returned, to, the, idea, of, the, lingua, illustre, at, the, head, of, the, lombard, school, were, monti, and, his, son, in, law, count, giulio, perticari, this, caused, vincenzo, monti, to, write, proposta, di, alcune, correzioni, ed, aggiunte, al, vocabolario, della, crusca, in, which, he, attacked, the, tuscanism, of, the, accademia, della, crusca, the, dispute, about, language, took, its, place, beside, literary, and, political, disputes, and, all, italy, took, part, in, it, basilio,

aeschylus, as, well, as, in, writing, the, discorsi, sulla, tragedia, greca, and, the, sublime, michelangelo, niccolini, displayed, his, devotion, to, ancient, literature, in, his, tragedies, he, set, himself, free, from, the, excessive, rigidity, of, alfieri, and, partly, approached, the, english, and, german, tragic, authors, he, nearly, always, chose, political, subjects, such, are, nabucco, antonio, foscarini, giovanni, da, procida, lodovico, il, moro, and, others, he, assailed, papal, rome, in, arnaldo, da, brescia, niccolini, s, tragedies, show, a, rich, lyric, vein, rather, than, dramatic, genius, he, has, the, merit, of, having, vindicated, liberal, ideas, and, of, having, opened, a, new, path, to, italian, tragedy, carlo, botta, wrote, a, history, of, italy, from, 1789, to, 1814, and, later, continued, guicciardini, s, history, up, to, 1789, close, to, botta, comes, pietro, colletta, he, also, in, his, storia, del, reame, di, napoli, dal, 1734, al, 1825, had, the, idea, of, defending, the, independence, and, liberty, of, italy, in, a, style, borrowed, from, tacitus, lazzaro, papi, of, lucca, author, of, the, commentari, della, rivoluzione, francese, dal, 1789, al, 1814, was, not, altogether, unlike, botta, and, colletta, he, also, was, a, historian, in, the, classical, style, and, treats, his, subject, with, patriotic, feeling, but, as, an, artist, he, perhaps, excels, in, the, other, two, alberto, fortis, started, the, morlachist, literary, movement, in, italian, and, venetian, literature, with, his, 1774, work, viaggio, in, dalmazia, journey, to, dalmatia, the, ideas, behind, the, french, revolution, of, 1789, gave, a, special, direction, to, italian, literature, in, the, second, half, of, the, 18th, century, love, of, liberty, and, desire, for, equality, created, a, literature, aimed, at, national, objects, seeking, to, improve, the, condition, of, the, country, by, freeing, it, from, the, double, yoke, of, political, and, religious, despotism, the, italians, who, aspired, to, political, redemption, believed, it, inseparable, from, an, intellectual, revival, and, thought, that, this, could, only, be, effected, by, a, reunion, with, ancient, classicism, this, was, a, repetition, of, what, had, occurred, in, the, first, half, of, the, 15th, century, patriotism, and, classicism, were, the, two, principles, that, inspired, the, literature, that, began, with, vittorio, alfieri, he, worshipped, the, greek, and, roman, idea, of, popular, liberty, in, arms, against, tyranny, he, took, the, subjects, of, his, tragedies, from, the, history, of, these, nations, and, made, his, ancient, characters, talk, like, revolutionists, of, his, time, the, arcadian, school, with, its, verbosity, and, triviality, was, rejected, his, aim, was, to, be, brief, concise, strong, and, bitter, to, aim, at, the, sublime, as, opposed, to, the, lowly, and, pastoral, he, saved, literature, from, arcadian, vacuities, leading, it, towards, a, national, end, and, armed, himself, with, patriotism, and, classicism, it, is, to, his, dramas, that, alfieri, is, chiefly, indebted, for, the, high, reputation, he, has, attained, the, appearance, of, the, tragedies, of, alfieri, was, perhaps, the, most, important, literary, event, that, occurred, in, italy, during, the, 18th, century, vincenzo, monti, was, a, patriot, too, and, wrote, the, pellegrino, apostolico, the, bassvilliana, and, the, feroniade, napoleon, s, victories, caused, him, to, write, the, prometeo, and, the, musagonia, in, his, fanatismo, and, his, superstizione, he, attacked, the, papacy, afterwards, he, sang, the, praises, of, the, austrians, knowing, little, greek, he, succeeded, in, translating, the, iliad, in, a, way, remarkable, for, its, homeric, feeling, and, in, his, bassvilliana, he, is, on, a, level, with, dante, in, him, classical, poetry, seemed, to, revive, in, all, its, florid, grandeur, ugo, foscolo, was, an, eager, patriot, inspired, by, classical, models, the, lettere, di, jacopo, ortis, inspired, by, goethe, s, the, sorrows, of, young, werther, are, a, love, story, with, a, mixture, of, patriotism, they, contain, a, violent, protest, against, the, treaty, of, campo, formio, and, an, outburst, from, foscolo, s, own, heart, about, an, unhappy, love, affair, of, his, his, passions, were, sudden, and, violent, to, one, of, these, passions, ortis, owed, its, origin, and, it, is, perhaps, the, best, and, most, sincere, of, all, his, writings, the, sepolcri, which, is, his, best, poem, was, prompted, by, high, feeling, and, the, mastery, of, versification, shows, wonderful, art, among, his, prose, works, a, high, place, belongs, to, his, translation, of, the, sentimental, journey, of, laurence, sterne, a, writer, by, whom, foscolo, was, deeply, affected, he, wrote, for, english, readers, some, essays, on, petrarch, and, on, the, texts, of, the, decamerone, and, of, dante, which, are, remarkable, for, when, they, were, written, and, which, may, have, initiated, a, new, type, of, literary, criticism, in, italy, the, men, who, made, the, revolution, of, 1848, were, brought, up, in, his, work, the, romantic, school, had, as, its, organ, the, conciliatore, established, in, 1818, at, milan, on, the, staff, of, which, were, silvio, pellico, ludovico, di, breme, giovile, scalvini, tommaso, grossi, giovanni, berchet, samuele, biava, and, alessandro, manzoni, all, were, influenced, by, the, ideas, that, especially, in, germany, constituted, the, movement, called, romanticism, in, italy, the, course, of, literary, reform, took, another, direction, the, main, instigator, of, the, reform, was, alessandro, manzoni, he, formulated, the, objects, of, the, new, school, saying, that, it, aspired, to, try, to, discover, and, express, il, vero, storico, and, il, vero, morale, not, only, as, an, end, but, as, the, widest, and, eternal, source, of, the, beautiful, it, is, realism, in, art, that, characterizes, italian, literature, from, manzoni, onwards, the, promessi, sposi, the, betrothed, is, the, work, that, has, made, him, immortal, the, promessi, sposi, is, generally, ranked, among, the, masterpieces, of, world, literature, the, novel, is, also, a, symbol, of, the, italian, risorgimento, both, for, its, patriotic, message, and, because, it, was, a, fundamental, milestone, in, the, development, of, the, modern, unified, italian, language, the, great, poet, of, the, age, was, giacomo, leopardi, he, was, also, an, admirable, prose, writer, in, his, operette, morali, dialogues, and, discourses, marked, by, a, cold, and, bitter, smile, at, human, destinies, that, freezes, the, reader, the, clearness, of, style, the, simplicity, of, language, and, the, depth, of, conception, are, such, that, perhaps, he, is, not, only, the, greatest, lyrical, poet, since, dante, but, also, one, of, the, most, perfect, writers, of, prose, that, italian, literature, has, had, he, is, widely, seen, as, one, of, the, most, radical, and, challenging, thinkers, of, the, 19th, century, but, routinely, compared, by, italian, critics, to, his, older, contemporary, alessandro, manzoni, despite, expressing, diametrically, opposite, positions, the, strongly, lyrical, quality, of, his, poetry, made, him, a, central, figure, on, the, european, and, international, literary, and, cultural, landscape, as, realism, in, art, gained, ground, the, positive, method, in, criticism, kept, pace, with, it, history, returned, to, its, spirit, of, learned, research, as, is, shown, in, such, works, as, the, archivio, storico, italiano, established, at, florence, by, giovan, pietro, vieusseux, the, storia, d, italia, nel, medio, evo, by, carlo, troya, a, remarkable, treatise, by, manzoni, himself, sopra, alcuni, punti, della, storia, longobardica, in, italia, and, the, very, fine, history, of, the, vespri, siciliani, by, michele, amari, alongside, the, great, artists, leopardi, and, manzoni, alongside, the, learned, scholars, there, was, also, in, the, 19th, century, patriotic, literature, vieusseux, had, a, distinct, political, object, when, in, 1820, he, established, the, monthly, review, antologia, his, archivio, storico, italiano, 1842, was, under, a, different, form, a, continuation, of, the, antologia, which, was, suppressed, in, 1833, owing, to, the, action, of, the, russian, government, the, literary, movement, that, preceded, and, was, contemporary, with, the, political, revolution, of, 1848, may, be, said, to, be, represented, by, four, writers, giuseppe, giusti, francesco, domenico, guerrazzi, vincenzo, gioberti, and, cesare, balbo, giusti, wrote, epigrammatic, satires, in, popular, language, guerrazzi, had, a, great, reputation, and, great, influence, but, his, historical, novels, though, avidly, read, before, 1848, were, soon, forgotten, gioberti, was, a, powerful, polemical, writer, the, primato, morale, e, civile, degli, italiani, will, last, as, an, important, document, of, the, times, and, the, gesuita, moderno, is, the, most, tremendous, indictment, of, the, jesuits, ever, written, in, italy, balbo, was, an, earnest, student, of, history, like, gioberti, in, his, first, period, balbo, was, zealous, for, the, civil, papacy, and, for, a, federation, of, the, italian, states, presided, over, by, it, his, sommario, della, storia, d, italia, is, an, excellent, epitome, after, the, risorgimento, political, literature, became, less, important, the, first, part, of, this, period, is, characterized, by, two, divergent, trends, of, literature, that, both, opposed, romanticism, the, first, trend, is, the, scapigliatura, that, attempted, to, rejuvenate, italian, culture, through, foreign, influences, notably, from, the, poetry, of, charles, baudelaire, and, the, works, of, american, writer, edgar, allan, poe, the, second, trend, is, represented, by, giosu, carducci, a, dominant, figure, of, this, period, fiery, opponent, of, the, romantics, and, restorer, of, the, ancient, metres, and, spirit, who, great, as, a, poet, was, scarcely, less, distinguished, as, a, literary, critic, and, historian, the, influence, of, mile, zola, is, evident, in, the, verismo, luigi, capuana, but, most, notably, giovanni, verga, and, were, its, main, exponents, and, the, authors, of, a, verismo, manifesto,

original, work, in, poetry, drama, and, fiction, of, extraordinary, originality, he, began, with, some, lyrics, distinguished, no, less, by, their, exquisite, beauty, of, form, than, by, their,
