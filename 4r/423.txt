musical, adaptation, of, romeo, and, juliet, he, proposed, that, the, plot, focus, on, the, conflict, between, an, irish, catholic, family, and, a, jewish, family, living, on, the, lower, east, side, of, manhattan, during, the, easter, passover, season, the, girl, has, survived, the, holocaust, and, emigrated, from, israel, the, conflict, was, to, be, centered, on, antisemitism, of, the, catholic, jets, towards, the, jewish, emeralds, a, name, that, made, its, way, into, the, script, as, a, reference, eager, to, write, his, first, musical, laurents, immediately, agreed, bernstein, wanted, to, present, the, material, in, operatic, form, but, robbins, and, laurents, resisted, the, suggestion, they, described, the, project, as, lyric, theater, and, laurents, wrote, a, first, draft, he, called, east, side, story, only, after, he, completed, it, did, the, group, realize, it, was, little, more, than, a, musicalization, of, themes, that, had, already, been, covered, in, plays, like, abie, s, irish, rose, when, robbins, opted, to, drop, out, the, three, men, went, their, separate, ways, and, the, piece, was, shelved, for, almost, five, years, in, 1955, theatrical, producer, martin, gabel, was, working, on, a, stage, adaptation, of, the, james, m, cain, novel, serenade, about, an, opera, singer, who, comes, to, the, realization, he, is, homosexual, and, he, invited, laurents, to, write, the, book, laurents, accepted, and, suggested, bernstein, and, robbins, join, the, creative, team, robbins, felt, if, the, three, were, going, to, join, forces, they, should, return, to, east, side, story, and, bernstein, agreed, laurents, however, was, committed, to, gabel, who, introduced, him, to, the, young, composer, lyricist, stephen, sondheim, sondheim, auditioned, by, playing, the, score, for, saturday, night, his, musical, that, was, scheduled, to, open, in, the, fall, laurents, liked, the, lyrics, but, was, not, impressed, with, the, music, sondheim, did, not, care, for, laurents, opinion, serenade, ultimately, was, shelved, laurents, was, soon, hired, to, write, the, screenplay, for, a, remake, of, the, 1934, greta, garbo, film, the, painted, veil, for, ava, gardner, while, in, hollywood, he, contacted, bernstein, who, was, in, town, conducting, at, the, hollywood, bowl, the, two, met, at, the, beverly, hills, hotel, and, the, conversation, turned, to, juvenile, delinquent, gangs, a, fairly, recent, social, phenomenon, that, had, received, major, coverage, on, the, front, pages, of, the, morning, newspapers, due, to, a, chicano, turf, war, bernstein, suggested, they, rework, east, side, story, and, set, it, in, los, angeles, but, laurents, felt, he, was, more, familiar, with, puerto, ricans, in, the, united, states, and, harlem, than, he, was, with, mexican, americans, and, olvera, street, the, two, contacted, robbins, who, was, enthusiastic, about, a, musical, with, a, latin, beat, he, arrived, in, hollywood, to, choreograph, the, dance, sequences, for, the, 1956, film, the, king, and, i, and, he, and, laurents, began, developing, the, musical, while, working, on, their, respective, projects, keeping, in, touch, with, bernstein, who, had, returned, to, new, york, when, the, producer, of, the, painted, veil, replaced, gardner, with, eleanor, parker, and, asked, laurents, to, revise, his, script, with, her, in, mind, he, backed, out, of, the, film, freeing, him, to, devote, all, his, time, to, the, stage, musical, bernstein, and, laurents, who, had, been, blacklisted, for, alleged, communist, activities, worked, with, robbins, even, though, he, had, cooperated, with, the, house, un, american, activities, committee, in, new, york, city, laurents, went, to, the, opening, night, party, for, a, new, play, by, ugo, betti, there, he, met, sondheim, who, had, heard, that, east, side, story, now, retitled, west, side, story, was, back, on, track, bernstein, had, decided, he, needed, to, concentrate, solely, on, the, music, and, he, and, robbins, had, invited, betty, comden, and, adolph, green, to, write, the, lyrics, but, the, team, opted, to, work, on, peter, pan, instead, laurents, asked, sondheim, if, he, would, be, interested, in, tackling, the, task, initially, he, resisted, because, he, was, determined, to, write, the, full, score, for, his, next, project, saturday, night, had, been, scrapped, but, oscar, hammerstein, convinced, him, that, he, would, benefit, from, the, experience, and, he, accepted, meanwhile, laurents, had, written, a, new, draft, of, the, book, changing, the, characters, backgrounds, the, male, lead, once, an, irish, american, was, now, of, polish, and, irish, descent, and, the, formerly, jewish, female, lead, had, become, puerto, rican, the, original, book, laurents, wrote, closely, adhered, to, romeo, and, juliet, but, the, characters, based, on, shakespeare, s, rosaline, and, the, parents, of, the, doomed, lovers, were, eliminated, early, on, later, the, scenes, related, to, juliet, s, faking, her, death, and, committing, suicide, also, were, deleted, language, posed, a, problem, profanity, was, uncommon, in, the, theater, at, the, time, and, slang, expressions, were, avoided, for, fear, they, would, be, dated, by, the, time, the, production, opened, laurents, ultimately, invented, what, sounded, like, real, street, talk, but, actually, was, not, cut, the, frabba, jabba, for, example, sondheim, converted, long, passages, of, dialogue, and, sometimes, just, a, simple, phrase, like, a, boy, like, that, would, kill, your, brother, into, lyrics, with, the, help, of, oscar, hammerstein, laurents, convinced, bernstein, and, sondheim, to, move, one, hand, one, heart, which, he, considered, too, pristine, for, the, balcony, scene, to, the, scene, set, in, the, bridal, shop, and, as, a, result, tonight, was, written, to, replace, it, laurents, felt, that, the, building, tension, needed, to, be, alleviated, in, order, to, increase, the, impact, of, the, play, s, tragic, outcome, so, comic, relief, in, the, form, of, officer, krupke, was, added, to, the, second, act, he, was, outvoted, on, other, issues, he, felt, the, lyrics, to, america, and, i, feel, pretty, were, too, witty, for, the, characters, singing, them, but, they, stayed, in, the, score, and, proved, to, be, audience, favorites, another, song, kid, stuff, was, added, and, quickly, removed, during, the, washington, d, c, tryout, when, laurents, convinced, the, others, it, was, helping, tip, the, balance, of, the, show, into, typical, musical, comedy, bernstein, composed, west, side, story, and, candide, concurrently, which, led, to, some, switches, of, material, between, the, two, works, tony, and, maria, s, duet, one, hand, one, heart, was, originally, intended, for, cunegonde, in, candide, the, music, of, gee, officer, krupke, was, pulled, from, the, venice, scene, in, candide, laurents, explained, the, style, that, the, creative, team, finally, decided, on, just, as, tony, and, maria, our, romeo, and, juliet, set, themselves, apart, from, the, other, kids, by, their, love, so, we, have, tried, to, set, them, even, further, apart, by, their, language, their, songs, their, movement, wherever, possible, in, the, show, we, have, tried, to, heighten, emotion, or, to, articulate, inarticulate, adolescence, through, music, song, or, dance, the, show, was, nearly, complete, in, the, fall, of, 1956, but, almost, everyone, on, the, creative, team, needed, to, fulfill, other, commitments, first, robbins, was, involved, with, bells, are, ringing, then, bernstein, with, candide, and, in, january, 1957, a, clearing, in, the, woods, laurents, latest, play, opened, and, quickly, closed, when, a, backers, audition, failed, to, raise, any, money, for, west, side, story, late, in, the, spring, of, 1957, only, two, months, before, the, show, was, to, begin, rehearsals, producer, cheryl, crawford, pulled, out, of, the, project, every, other, producer, had, already, turned, down, the, show, deeming, it, too, dark, and, depressing, bernstein, was, despondent, but, sondheim, convinced, his, friend, hal, prince, who, was, in, boston, overseeing, the, out, of, town, tryout, of, the, new, george, abbott, musical, new, girl, in, town, to, read, the, script, he, liked, it, but, decided, to, ask, abbott, his, longtime, mentor, for, his, opinion, and, abbott, advised, him, to, turn, it, down, prince, aware, that, abbott, was, the, primary, reason, new, girl, was, in, trouble, decided, to, ignore, him, and, he, and, his, producing, partner, robert, e, griffith, flew, to, new, york, to, hear, the, score, in, his, memoirs, prince, recalled, sondheim, and, bernstein, sat, at, the, piano, playing, through, the, music, and, soon, i, was, singing, along, with, them, prince, began, cutting, the, budget, and, raising, money, robbins, then, announced, he, did, not, want, to, choreograph, the, show, but, changed, his, mind, when, prince, agreed, to, an, eight, week, dance, rehearsal, period, instead, of, the, customary, four, since, there, was, to, be, more, dancing, in, west, side, story, than, in, any, previous, broadway, show, and, allowed, robbins, to, hire, peter, gennaro, as, his, assistant, originally, when, considering, the, cast, laurents, wanted, james, dean, for, the, lead, role, of, tony, but, the, actor, soon, died, sondheim, found, larry, kert, and, chita, rivera, who, created, the, roles, of, tony, and, anita, respectively, getting, the, work, on, stage, was, still, not, easy, bernstein, said, everyone, told, us, that, was, an, impossible, project, and, we, were, told, no, one, was, going, to, be, able, to, sing, augmented, fourths, as, with, ma, ri, a, also, they, said, the, score, was, too, rangy, for, pop, music, besides, who, wanted, to, see, a, show, in, which, the, first, act, curtain, comes, down, on, two, dead, bodies, lying, on, the, stage, and, then, we, had, the, really, tough, problem, of, casting, it, because, the, characters, had, to, be, able, not, only, to, sing, but, dance, and, act, and, be, taken, for, teenagers, ultimately, some, of, the, cast, were, teenagers, some, were, 21, some, were, 30, but, looked, 16, some, were, wonderful, singers, but, couldn, t, dance, very, well, or, vice, versa, and, if, they, could, do, both, they, couldn, t, act, throughout, the, rehearsal, period, the, new, york, newspapers, were, filled, with, articles, about, gang, warfare, keeping, the, show, s, plot, timely, robbins, kept, the, cast, members, playing, the, sharks, and, the, jets, separate, in, order, to, discourage, them, from, socializing, with, each, other, and, reminded, everyone, of, the, reality, of, gang, violence, by, posting, news, stories, on, the, bulletin, board, backstage, robbins, wanted, a, gritty, realism, from, his, sneaker, and, jeans, clad, cast, he, gave, the, ensemble, more, freedom, than, broadway, dancers, had, previously, been, given, to, interpret, their, roles, and, the, dancers, were, thrilled, to, be, treated, like, actors, instead, of, just, choreographed, bodies, as, the, rehearsals, wore, on, bernstein, fought, to, keep, his, score, together, as, other, members, of, the, team, called, on, him, to, cut, out, more, and, more, of, the, sweeping, or, complex, operatic, passages, columbia, records, initially, declined, to, record, the, cast, album, saying, the, score, was, too, depressing, and, too, difficult, there, were, problems, with, oliver, smith, s, designs, his, painted, backdrops, were, stunning, but, the, sets, were, for, the, most, part, either, shabby, looking, or, too, stylized, prince, refused, to, spend, money, on, new, construction, and, smith, was, obliged, to, improve, what, he, had, as, best, he, could, with, very, little, money, to, do, it, the, pre, broadway, run, in, washington, d, c, was, a, critical, and, commercial, success, although, none, of, the, reviews, mentioned, sondheim, listed, as, co, lyricist, who, was, overshadowed, by, the, better, known, bernstein, bernstein, magnanimously, removed, his, name, as, co, author, of, the, lyrics, although, sondheim, was, uncertain, he, wanted, to, receive, sole, credit, for, what, he, considered, to, be, overly, florid, contributions, by, bernstein, robbins, demanded, and, received, a, conceived, by, credit, and, used, it, to, justify, his, making, major, decisions, regarding, changes, in, the, show, without, consulting, the, others, as, a, result, by, opening, night, on, broadway, none, of, his, collaborators, were, talking, to, him, it, has, been, rumored, that, while, bernstein, was, off, trying, to, fix, the, musical, candide, sondheim, wrote, some, of, the, music, for, west, side, story, and, that, bernstein, s, co, lyricist, billing, mysteriously, disappeared, from, the, credits, of, west, side, story, during, the, tryout, presumably, as, a, trade, off, however, steven, suskin, writes, in, show, tunes, that, as, the, writing, progressed, and, the, extent, of, bernstein, s, lyric, contributions, became, less, the, composer, agreed, to, rescind, his, credit, contrary, to, rumor, sondheim, did, not, write, music, for, the, show, his, only, contribution, came, on, something, s, coming, where, he, developed, the, main, strain, of, the, chorus, from, music, bernstein, wrote, for, the, verse, two, rival, teenage, gangs, the, jets, white, americans, and, the, sharks, puerto, ricans, struggle, for, control, of, their, neighborhood, on, the, upper, west,
