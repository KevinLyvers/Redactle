for, reinforcing, pillars, and, columns, perret, was, also, a, pioneer, in, covering, the, concrete, with, ceramic, tiles, both, for, protection, and, decoration, the, architect, le, corbusier, first, learned, the, uses, of, reinforced, concrete, working, as, a, draftsman, in, perret, s, studio, other, new, technologies, that, were, important, to, art, deco, were, new, methods, in, producing, plate, glass, which, was, less, expensive, and, allowed, much, larger, and, stronger, windows, and, for, mass, producing, aluminium, which, was, used, for, building, and, window, frames, and, later,

systematically, explored, the, decorative, ornamental, aspects, of, geometric, elements, forms, motifs, and, their, variations, in, contrast, with, and, as, a, departure, from, the, undulating, art, nouveau, style, of, hector, guimard, so, popular, in, paris, a, few, years, earlier, grasset, stressed, the, principle, that, various, simple, geometric, shapes, like, triangles, and, squares, are, the, basis, of, all, compositional, arrangements, the, reinforced, concrete, buildings, of, auguste, perret, and, henri, sauvage, and, particularly, the, th, tre, des, champs, lys, es, offered, a, new, form, of, construction, and, decoration, which, was, copied, worldwide, in, decoration, many, different, styles, were, borrowed, and, used, by, art, deco, they, included, pre, modern, art, from, around, the, world, and, observable, at, the, mus, e, du, louvre, mus, e, de, l, homme, and, the, mus, e, national, des, arts, d, afrique, et, d, oc, anie, there, was, also, popular, interest, in,

derain, inspired, the, designs, of, art, deco, textiles, wallpaper, and, painted, ceramics, it, took, ideas, from, the, high, fashion, vocabulary, of, the, period, which, featured, geometric, designs, chevrons, zigzags, and, stylized, bouquets, of, flowers, it, was, influenced, by, discoveries, in, egyptology, and, growing, interest, in, the, orient, and, in, african, art, from, 1925, onwards, it, was, often, inspired, by, a, passion, for, new, machines, such, as, airships, automobiles, and, ocean, liners, and, by, 1930, this, influence, resulted, in, the, style, called, streamline, moderne, the, event, that, marked, the, zenith, of, the, style, and, gave, it, its, name, was, the, international, exhibition, of, modern, decorative, and, industrial, arts, which, took, place, in, paris, from, april, to, october, in, 1925, this, was, officially, sponsored, by, the, french, government, and, covered, a, site, in, paris, of, 55, acres, running, from, the, grand, palais, on, the, right, bank, to, les, invalides, on, the, left, bank, and, along, the, banks, of, the, seine, the, grand, palais, the, largest, hall, in, the, city, was, filled, with, exhibits, of, decorative, arts, from,

exhibit, declined, to, participate, the, event, was, visited, by, sixteen, million, people, during, its, seven, month, run, the, rules, of, the, exhibition, required, that, all, work, be, modern, no, historical, styles, were, allowed, the, main, purpose, of, the, exhibit, was, to, promote, the, french, manufacturers, of, luxury, furniture, porcelain, glass, metalwork, textiles, and, other, decorative, products, to, further, promote, the, products, all, the, major, paris, department, stores, and, major, designers, had, their, own, pavilions, the, exposition, had, a, secondary, purpose, in, promoting, products, from, french, colonies, in, africa, and, asia, including, ivory, and, exotic, woods, the, h, tel, du, collectionneur, was, a, popular, attraction, at, the, exposition, it, displayed, the, new, furniture, designs, of, emile, jacques, ruhlmann, as, well, as, art, deco, fabrics, carpets, and, a, painting, by, jean, dupas, the, interior, design, followed, the, same, principles, of, symmetry, and, geometric, forms, which, set, it, apart, from, art, nouveau, and, bright, colours, fine, craftsmanship, rare, and, expensive, materials, which, set, it, apart, from, the, strict, functionality, of, the, modernist, style, while, most, of, the, pavilions, were, lavishly, decorated, and, filled, with, hand, made, luxury, furniture, two, pavilions, those, of, the, soviet, union, and, pavilion, de, l, esprit, nouveau, built, by, the, magazine, of, that, name, run, by, le, corbusier, were, built, in, an, austere, style, with, plain, white, walls, and, no, decoration, they, were, among, the, earliest, examples, of, modernist, architecture, in, 1925, two, different, competing, schools, coexisted, within, art, deco, the, traditionalists, who, had, founded, the, society, of, decorative, artists, included, the, furniture, designer, emile, jacques, ruhlmann, jean, dunand, the, sculptor, antoine, bourdelle, and, designer, paul, poiret, they, combined, modern, forms, with, traditional, craftsmanship, and, expensive, materials, on, the, other, side, were, the, modernists, who, increasingly, rejected, the, past, and, wanted, a, style, based, upon, advances, in, new, technologies, simplicity, a, lack, of, decoration, inexpensive, materials, and, mass, production, the, modernists, founded, their, own, organisation, the, french, union, of, modern, artists, in, 1929, its, members, included, architects, pierre, chareau, francis, jourdain, robert, mallet, stevens, corbusier, and, in, the, soviet, union, konstantin, melnikov, the, irish, designer, eileen, gray, the, french, designer, sonia, delaunay, and, the, jewellers, georges, fouquet, and, jean, puiforcat, they, fiercely, attacked, the, traditional, art, deco, style, which, they, said, was, created, only, for, the, wealthy, and, insisted, that, well, constructed, buildings, should, be, available, to, everyone, and, that, form, should, follow, function, the, beauty, of, an, object, or, building, resided, in, whether, it, was, perfectly, fit, to, fulfil, its, function, modern, industrial, methods, meant, that, furniture, and, buildings, could, be, mass, produced, not, made, by, hand, the, art, deco, interior, designer, paul, follot, defended, art, deco, in, this, way, we, know, that, man, is, never, content, with, the, indispensable, and, that, the, superfluous, is, always, needed, if, not, we, would, have, to, get, rid, of, music, flowers, and, perfumes, however, le, corbusier, was, a, brilliant, publicist, for, modernist, architecture, he, stated, that, a, house, was, simply, a, machine, to, live, in, and, tirelessly, promoted, the, idea, that, art, deco, was, the, past, and, modernism, was, the, future, le, corbusier, s, ideas, were, gradually, adopted, by, architecture, schools, and, the, aesthetics, of, art, deco, were, abandoned, the, same, features, that, made, art, deco, popular, in, the, beginning, its, craftsmanship, rich, materials, and, ornament, led, to, its, decline, the, great, depression, that, began, in, the, united, states, in, 1929, and, reached, europe, shortly, afterwards, greatly, reduced, the, number, of, wealthy, clients, who, could, pay, for, the, furnishings, and, art, objects, in, the, depression, economic, climate, few, companies, were, ready, to, build, new, skyscrapers, even, the, ruhlmann, firm, resorted, to, producing, pieces, of, furniture, in, series, rather, than, individual, hand, made, items, the, last, buildings, built, in, paris, in, the, new, style, were, the, museum, of, public, works, by, auguste, perret, now, the, french, economic, social, and, environmental, council, the, palais, de, chaillot, by, louis, hippolyte, boileau, jacques, carlu, and, l, on, az, ma, and, the,
