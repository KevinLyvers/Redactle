effect, on, attitudes, toward, african, americans, and, slavery, in, the, u, s, and, is, said, to, have, helped, lay, the, groundwork, for, the, civil, war, stowe, a, connecticut, born, teacher, at, the, hartford, female, seminary, was, part, of, the, religious, beecher, family, and, an, active, abolitionist, she, wrote, the, sentimental, novel, to, depict, the, reality, of, slavery, while, also, asserting, that, christian, love, could, overcome, slavery, the, novel, focuses, on, the, character, of, uncle, tom, a, long, suffering, black, slave, around, whom, the, stories, of, the, other,

credited, with, helping, fuel, the, abolitionist, cause, in, the, 1850s, the, influence, attributed, to, the, book, was, so, great, that, a, likely, apocryphal, story, arose, of, abraham, lincoln, meeting, stowe, at, the, start, of, the, civil, war, and, declaring, so, this, is, the, little, lady, who, started, this, great, war, the, book, and, the, plays, it, inspired, helped, popularize, a, number, of, negative, stereotypes, about, black, people, including, that, of, the, namesake, character, uncle, tom, the, term, came, to, be, associated, with, an, excessively, subservient, person, these, later, associations, with, uncle, tom, s, cabin, have, to, an, extent, overshadowed, the, historical, effects, of, the, book, as, a, vital, antislavery, tool, nonetheless, the, novel, remains, a, landmark, in, protest, literature, with, later, books, such, as, the, jungle, by, upton, sinclair, and, silent, spring, by, rachel, carson, owing, a, large, debt, to, it, stowe, a, connecticut, born, teacher, at, the, hartford, female, seminary, and, an, active, abolitionist, wrote, the, novel, as, a, response, to, the, passage, in, 1850, of, the, second, fugitive, slave, act, much, of, the, book, was, composed, at, her, house, in, brunswick, maine, where, her, husband, calvin, ellis, stowe, taught, at, his, alma, mater, bowdoin, college, stowe, was, partly, inspired, to, create, uncle, tom, s, cabin, by, the, slave, narrative, the, life, of, josiah, henson, formerly, a, slave, now, an, inhabitant, of, canada, as, narrated, by, himself, 1849, henson, a, formerly, enslaved, black, man, had, lived, and, worked, on, a, 3, 700, acre, 15, km, 2, plantation, in, north, bethesda, maryland, owned, by, isaac, riley, henson, escaped, slavery, in, 1830, by, fleeing, to, the, province, of, upper, canada, now, ontario, where, he, helped, other, fugitive, slaves, settle, and, become, self, sufficient, stowe, was, also, inspired, by, the, posthumous, biography, of, phebe, ann, jacobs, a, devout, congregationalist, of, brunswick, maine, born, on, a, slave, plantation, in, lake, hiawatha, new, jersey, jacobs, was, enslaved, for, most, of, her, life, including, by, the, president, of, bowdoin, college, in, her, final, years, jacobs, lived, as, a, free, woman, laundering, clothes, for, bowdoin, students, she, achieved, respect, from, her, community, due, to, her, devout, religious, beliefs, and, her, funeral, was, widely, attended, another, source, stowe, used, as, research, for, uncle, tom, s, cabin, was, american, slavery, as, it, is, testimony, of, a, thousand, witnesses, a, volume, co, authored, by, theodore, dwight, weld, and, the, grimk, sisters, stowe, also, conducted, interviews, with, people, who, escaped, slavery, stowe, mentioned, a, number, of, these, inspirations, and, sources, in, a, key, to, uncle, tom, s, cabin, 1853, this, non, fiction, book, was, intended, to, not, only, verify, stowe, s, claims, about, slavery, but, also, point, readers, to,

starting, with, the, june, 5, 1851, issue, it, was, originally, intended, as, a, shorter, narrative, that, would, run, for, only, a, few, weeks, stowe, expanded, the, story, significantly, however, and, it, was, instantly, popular, such, that, protests, were, sent, to, the, era, office, when, she, missed, an, issue, the, final, installment, was, released, in, the, april, 1, 1852, issue, of, era,

farm, because, of, debts, even, though, he, and, his, wife, emily, shelby, believe, that, they, have, a, benevolent, relationship, with, their, slaves, shelby, decides, to, raise, the, needed, funds, by, selling, two, of, them, uncle, tom, a, middle, aged, man, with, a, wife, and, children, and, harry, the, son, of, emily, shelby, s, maid, eliza, to, mr, haley, a, coarse, slave, trader, emily,

family, to, their, home, in, new, orleans, tom, and, eva, begin, to, relate, to, one, another, because, of, the, deep, christian, faith, they, both, share, during, eliza, s, escape, she, meets, up, with, her, husband, george, harris, who, had, run, away, previously, they, decide, to, attempt, to, reach, canada, but, are, tracked, by, tom, loker, a, slave, hunter, hired, by, mr, haley,

prejudiced, against, black, people, st, clare, however, believes, he, is, not, biased, even, though, he, is, a, slave, owner, in, an, attempt, to, show, ophelia, that, her, prejudiced, views, against,

plantation, owner, named, simon, legree, tom, is, taken, to, rural, louisiana, with, other, new, slaves, including, emmeline, whom, simon, legree, has, purchased, to, use, as, a, sex, slave, legree, begins, to, hate, tom, when, tom, refuses, legree, s, order, to, whip, his, fellow, slave, legree, beats, tom, viciously, and, resolves, to, crush, his, new, slave, s, faith, in, god, despite, legree, s, cruelty, tom, refuses, to, stop, reading, his, bible, and, comforting, the, other, slaves, as, best, he, can, while, at, the, plantation, tom, meets, cassy, another, slave, whom, legree, used, as, a, sex, slave, cassy, tells, her, story, to, tom, she, was, previously, separated, from, her, son, and, daughter, when, they, were, sold, she, became, pregnant, again, but, killed, the, child, because, she, could, not, tolerate, having, another, child, separated, from, her, tom, loker, changed, after, being, healed, by, the, quakers, returns, to, the, story, he, has, helped, george, eliza,

father, s, death, he, frees, all, his, slaves, george, shelby, urges, them, to, remember, tom, s, sacrifice, every, time, they, look, at, his, cabin, he, decides, to, lead, a, pious, christian, life, just, as, uncle, tom, did, uncle, tom, s, cabin, is, dominated, by, a, single, theme, the, evil, and, immorality, of, slavery, while, stowe, weaves, other, subthemes, throughout, her, text, such, as, the, moral, authority, of, motherhood, and, the, power, of, christian, love, she, emphasizes, the, connections, between, these, and, the, horrors, of, slavery, stowe, sometimes, changed, the, story, s, voice, so, she, could, give, a, homily, on, the, destructive, nature, of, slavery, such, as, when, a, white, woman, on, the, steamboat, carrying, tom, further, south, states, the, most, dreadful, part, of, slavery, to, my, mind, is, its, outrages, of, feelings, and, affections, the, separating, of, families, for, example, one, way, stowe, showed, the, evil, of, slavery, was, how, this, peculiar, institution, forcibly, separated, families, from, each, other, one, of, the, subthemes, presented, in, the, novel, is, temperance, stowe, made, it, somewhat, subtle, and, in, some, cases, she, wove, it, into, events, that, would, also, support, the, dominant, theme, one, example, of, this, is, when, augustine, st, clare, is, killed, he, attempted, to, stop, a, brawl, between, two, inebriated, men, in, a, cafe, and, was, stabbed, another, example, is, the, death, of, prue, who, was, whipped, to, death, for, being, drunk, on, a, consistent, basis, however, her, reasons, for, doing, so, is, due, to, the, loss, of, her, baby, in, the, opening, of, the, novel, the, fates, of, eliza, and, her, son, are, being, discussed, between, slave, owners, over, wine, considering, that, stowe, intended, this, to, be, a, subtheme, this, scene, could, foreshadow, future, events, that, put, alcohol, in, a, bad, light, because, stowe, saw, motherhood, as, the, ethical, and, structural, model, for, all, of, american, life, and, also, believed, that, only, women, had, the, moral, authority, to, save, the, united, states, from, the, demon, of, slavery, another, major, theme, of, uncle, tom, s, cabin, is, the, moral, power, and, sanctity, of, women, through, characters, like, eliza, who, escapes, from, slavery, to, save, her, young, son, and, eventually, reunites, her, entire, family, or, eva, who, is, seen, as, the, ideal, christian, stowe, shows, how, she, believed, women, could, save, those, around, them, from, even, the, worst, injustices, though, later, critics, have, noted, that, stowe, s, female, characters, are, often, domestic, clich, s, instead, of, realistic, women, stowe, s, novel, reaffirmed, the, importance, of, women, s, influence, and, helped, pave, the, way, for, the, women, s, rights, movement, in, the, following, decades, stowe, s, puritanical, religious, beliefs, show, up, in, the, novel, s, final, overarching, theme, the, exploration, of, the, nature, of, christian, love, and, how, she, feels, christian, theology, is, fundamentally, incompatible, with, slavery, this, theme, is, most, evident, when, tom, urges, st, clare, to, look, away, to, jesus, after, the, death, of, st, clare, s, beloved, daughter, eva, after, tom, dies, george, shelby, eulogizes, tom, by, saying, what, a, thing, it, is, to, be, a, christian, because, christian, themes, play, such, a, large, role, in, uncle, tom, s, cabin, and, because, of, stowe, s, frequent, use, of, direct, authorial, interjections, on, religion, and, faith, the, novel, often, takes, the, form, of, a, sermon, over, the, years, scholars, have, postulated, a, number, of, theories, about, what, stowe, was, trying, to, say, with, the, novel, aside, from, the, major, theme, of, condemning, slavery, for, example, as, an, ardent, christian, and, active, abolitionist, stowe, placed, many, of, her, religious, beliefs, into, the, novel, some, scholars, have, stated, that, stowe, saw, her, novel, as, offering, a, solution, to, the, moral, and, political, dilemma, that, troubled, many, slavery, opponents, whether, engaging, in, prohibited, behavior, was, justified, in, opposing, evil, was, the, use, of, violence, to, oppose, the, violence, of, slavery, and, the, breaking, of, proslavery, laws, morally, defensible, which, of, stowe, s, characters, should, be, emulated, the, passive, uncle, tom, or, the, defiant, george, harris, stowe, s, solution, was, similar, to, ralph, waldo, emerson, s, god, s, will, would, be, followed, if, each, person, sincerely, examined, his, principles, and, acted, on, them, scholars, have, also, seen, the, novel, as, expressing, the, values, and, ideas, of, the, free, will, movement, in, this, view, the, character, of, george, harris, embodies, the, principles, of, free, labor, and, the, complex, character, of, ophelia, represents, those, northerners, who, condoned, compromise, with, slavery, in, contrast, to, ophelia, is, dinah, who, operates, on, passion, during, the, course, of, the, novel, ophelia, is, transformed, just, as, the, republican, party, three, years, later, proclaimed, that, the, north, must, transform, itself, and, stand, up, for, its, antislavery, principles, feminist, theory, can, also, be, seen, at, play, in, stowe, s, book, with, the, novel, as, a, critique, of, the, patriarchal, nature, of, slavery, for, stowe, blood, relations, rather, than, paternalistic, relations, between, masters, and, slaves, formed, the, basis, of, families, moreover, stowe, viewed, national, solidarity, as, an, extension, of, a, person, s, family, thus, feelings, of, nationality, stemmed, from, possessing, a, shared, race, consequently, she, advocated, african, colonization, for, freed, slaves, and, not, amalgamation, into, american, society, the, book, has, also, been, seen, as, an, attempt, to, redefine, masculinity, as, a, necessary, step, toward, the, abolition, of, slavery, in, this, view, abolitionists, had, begun, to, resist, the, vision, of, aggressive, and, dominant, men, that, the, conquest, and, colonization, of, the, early, 19th, century, had, fostered, to, change, the, notion, of, manhood, so, that, men, could, oppose, slavery, without, jeopardizing, their, self, image, or, their, standing, in, society, some, abolitionists, drew, on, principles, of, women, s, suffrage, and, christianity, as, well, as, passivism, and, praised, men, for, cooperation, compassion, and, civic, spirit, others, within, the, abolitionist, movement, argued, for, conventional, aggressive, masculine, action, all, the, men, in, stowe, s, novel, are, representations, of, either, one, kind, of, man, or, the, other, uncle, tom, s, cabin, is, written, in, the, sentimental, and, melodramatic, style, common, to, 19th, century, sentimental, novels, and, domestic, fiction, also, called, women, s, fiction, these, genres, were, the, most, popular, novels, of, stowe, s, time, and, were, written, by, for, and, about, women, along, with, featuring, a, writing, style, that, evoked, a, reader, s, sympathy, and, emotion, uncle, tom, s, cabin, has, been, called, a, representative, example, of, a, sentimental, novel, the, power, in, this, type, of, writing, can, be, seen, in, the, reaction, of, contemporary, readers, georgiana, may, a, friend, of, stowe, s, wrote, a, letter, to, the, author, saying, i, was, up, last, night, long, after, one, o, clock, reading, and, finishing, uncle, tom, s, cabin, i, could, not, leave, it, any, more, than, i, could, have, left, a, dying, child, another, reader, is, described, as, obsessing, on, the, book, at, all, hours, and, having, considered, renaming, her, daughter, eva, evidently, the, death, of, little, eva, affected, a, lot, of, people, at, that, time, because, in, 1852, 300, baby, girls, in, boston, alone, were, given, that, name, despite, this, positive, reaction, from, readers, for, decades, literary, critics, dismissed, the, style, found, in, uncle, tom, s, cabin, and, other, sentimental, novels, because, these, books, were, written, by, women, and, so, prominently, featured, what, one, critic, called, women, s, sloppy, emotions, another, literary, critic, said, that, had, the, novel, not, been, about, slavery, it, would, be, just, another, sentimental, novel, and, another, described, the, book, as, primarily, a, derivative, piece, of, hack, work, in, the, literary, history, of, the, united, states, george, f, whicher, called, uncle, tom, s, cabin, sunday, school, fiction, full, of, broadly, conceived, melodrama, humor, and, pathos, in, 1985, jane, tompkins, expressed, a, different, view, with, her, famous, defense, of, the, book, in, sentimental, power, uncle, tom, s, cabin, and, the, politics, of, literary, history, tompkins, praised, the, style, so, many, other, critics, had, dismissed, writing, that, sentimental, novels, showed, how, women, s, emotions, had, the, power, to, change, the, world, for, the, better, she, also, said, that, the, popular, domestic, novels, of, the, 19th, century, including, uncle, tom, s, cabin, were, remarkable, for, their, intellectual, complexity, ambition, and, resourcefulness, and, that, uncle, tom, s, cabin, offers, a, critique, of, american, society, far, more, devastating, than, any, delivered, by, better, known, critics, such, as, hawthorne, and, melville, uncle, tom, s, cabin, has, exerted, an, influence, equaled, by, few, other, novels, in, history, upon, publication, uncle, tom, s, cabin, ignited, a, firestorm, of, protest, from, defenders, of, slavery, who, created, a, number, of, books, in, response, to, the, novel, while, the, book, elicited, praise, from, abolitionists, the, novel, is, considered, an, influential, landmark, of, protest, literature, uncle, tom, s, cabin, had, an, incalculable, impact, on, the, 19th, century, world, and, captured, the, imagination, of, many, americans, in, a, likely, apocryphal, story, that, alludes, to, the, novel, s, impact, when, abraham, lincoln, met, stowe, in, 1862, he, supposedly, commented, so, this, is, the, little, lady, who, started, this, great, war, historians, are, undecided, if, lincoln, actually, said, this, line, and, in, a, letter, that, stowe, wrote, to, her, husband, a, few, hours, after, meeting, with, lincoln, no, mention, of, this, comment, was, made, many, writers, have, also, credited, the, novel, with, focusing, northern, anger, at, the, injustices, of, slavery, and, the, fugitive, slave, law, and, helping, to, fuel, the, abolitionist, movement, union, general, and, politician, james, baird, weaver, said, that, the, book, convinced, him, to, become, active, in, the, abolitionist, movement, frederick, douglass, was, convinced, both, of, the, social, uses, of, the, novel, and, of, stowe, s, humanitarianism, and, heavily, promoted, the, novel, in, his, newspaper, during, the, book, s, initial, release, though, douglass, said, uncle, tom, s, cabin, was, a, work, of, marvelous, depth, and, power, he, also, published, criticism, of, the, novel, most, prominently, by, martin, delany, in, a, series, of, letters, in, the, paper, delany, accused, stowe, of, borrowing, and, thus, profiting, from, the, work, of, black, writers, to, compose, her, novel, and, chastised, stowe, for, her, apparent, support, of, black, colonization, to, africa, martin, was, one, of, the, most, out, spoken, black, critics, of, uncle, tom, s, cabin, at, the, time, and, later, wrote, blake, or, the, huts, of, america, a, novel, where, an, african, american, chooses, violent, rebellion, over, tom, s, resignation, white, people, in, the, american, south, were, outraged, at, the, novel, s, release, with, the, book, also, roundly, criticized, by, slavery, supporters, southern, novelist, william, gilmore, simms, declared, the, work, utterly, false, while, also, calling, it, slanderous, reactions, ranged, from, a, bookseller, in, mobile, alabama, being, forced, to, leave, town, for, selling, the, novel, to, threatening, letters, sent, to, stowe, including, a, package, containing, a, slave, s, severed, ear, many, southern, writers, like, simms, soon, wrote, their, own, books, in, opposition, to, stowe, s, novel, some, critics, highlighted, stowe, s, paucity, of, life, experience, relating, to, southern, life, saying, that, it, led, her, to, create, inaccurate, descriptions, of, the, region, for, instance, she, had, never, been, to, a, southern, plantation, stowe, always, said, she, based, the, characters, of, her, book, on, stories, she, was, told, by, runaway, slaves, in, cincinnati, it, is, reported, that, she, observed, firsthand, several, incidents, which, galvanized, her, to, write, famous, anti, slavery, novel, scenes, she, observed, on, the, ohio, river, including, seeing, a, husband, and, wife, being, sold, apart, as, well, as, newspaper, and, magazine, accounts, and, interviews, contributed, material, to, the, emerging, plot, in, response, to, these, criticisms, in, 1853, stowe, published, a, key, to, uncle, tom, s, cabin, an, attempt, to, document, the, veracity, of, the, novel, s, depiction, of, slavery, in, the, book, stowe, discusses, each, of, the, major, characters, in, uncle, tom, s, cabin, and, cites, real, life, equivalents, to, them, while, also, mounting, a, more, aggressive, attack, on, slavery, in, the, south, than, the, novel, itself, had, like, the, novel, a, key, to, uncle, tom, s, cabin, was, a, best, seller, but, although, stowe, claimed, a, key, to, uncle, tom, s, cabin, documented, her, previously, consulted, sources, she, actually, read, many, of, the, cited, works, only, after, the, publication, of, her, novel, uncle, tom, s, cabin, also, created, great, interest, in, the, united, kingdom, the, first, london, edition, appeared, in, may, 1852, and, sold, 200, 000, copies, some, of, this, interest, was, due, to, anti, americanism, in, britain, as, english, lawyer, nassau, william, senior, argued, the, evil, passions, which, uncle, tom, gratified, in, england, were, not, hatred, or, vengeance, but, national, jealousy, and, national, vanity, we, have, long, been, smarting, under, the, conceit, of, america, we, are, tired, of, hearing, her, boast, that, she, is, the, freest, and, the, most, enlightened, country, that, the, world, has, ever, seen, our, clergy, hate, her, voluntary, system, our, tories, hate, her, democrats, our, whigs, hate, her, parvenus, our, radicals, hate, her, litigiousness, her, insolence, and, her, ambition, all, parties, hailed, mrs, stowe, as, a, revolter, from, the, enemy, she, taught, us, how, to, prove, that, democrats, may, be, tyrants, that, an, aristocracy, of, caste, is, more, oppressive, than, an, aristocracy, of, station, our, pity, for, the, victim, is, swallowed, up, by, our, hatred, of, the, tyrant, stowe, sent, a, copy, of, the, book, to, charles, dickens, who, wrote, her, in, response, i, have, read, your, book, with, the, deepest, interest, and, sympathy, and, admire, more, than, i, can, express, to, you, both, the, generous, feeling, which, inspired, it, and, the, admirable, power, with, which, it, is, executed, the, historian, and, politician, thomas, babington, macaulay, wrote, in, 1852, that, it, is, the, most, valuable, addition, that, america, has, made, to, english, literature, charles, francis, adams, sr, the, american, ambassador, to, britain, during, the, civil, war, argued, later, that, uncle, tom, s, cabin, or, life, among, the, lowly, published, in, 1852, exercised, largely, from, fortuitous, circumstances, a, more, immediate, considerable, and, dramatic, world, influence, than, any, other, book, ever, printed, leo, tolstoy, claimed, that, uncle, tom, s, cabin, was, a, greater, work, than, any, play, written, by, shakespeare, because, it, flowed, from, the, love, of, god, and, man, in, the, 20th, century, a, number, of, writers, attacked, uncle, tom, s, cabin, not, only, for, the, stereotypes, the, novel, had, created, about, african, americans, but, also, because, of, the, utter, disdain, of, the, tom, character, by, the, black, community, these, writers, included, richard, wright, with, his, collection, uncle, tom, s, children, 1938, and, chester, himes, with, his, 1943, short, story, heaven, has, changed, ralph, ellison, also, critiqued, the, book, with, his, 1952, novel, invisible, man, with, ellison, figuratively, killing, uncle, tom, in, the, opening, chapter, in, 1945, james, baldwin, published, his, influential, and, infamous, critical, essay, everbody, s, protest, novel, in, the, essay, baldwin, described, uncle, tom, s, cabin, as, a, bad, novel, having, in, its, self, righteousness, virtuous, sentimentality, he, argued, that, the, novel, lacked, psychological, depth, and, that, stowe, was, not, so, much, a, novelist, as, an, impassioned, pamphleteer, edward, rothstein, has, claimed, that, baldwin, missed, the, point, and, that, the, purpose, of, the, novel, was, to, treat, slavery, not, as, a, political, issue, but, as, an, individually, human, one, and, ultimately, a, challenge, to, christianity, itself, george, orwell, in, his, essay, good, bad, books, first, published, in, tribune, in, november, 1945, claims, that, perhaps, the, supreme, example, of, the, good, bad, book, is, uncle, tom, s, cabin, it, is, an, unintentionally, ludicrous, book, full, of, preposterous, melodramatic, incidents, it, is, also, deeply, moving, and, essentially, true, it, is, hard, to, say, which, quality, outweighs, the, other, but, he, concludes, i, would, back, uncle, tom, s, cabin, to, outlive, the, complete, works, of, virginia, woolf, or, george, moore, though, i, know, of, no, strictly, literary, test, which, would, show, where, the, superiority, lies, the, negative, associations, related, to, uncle, tom, s, cabin, in, particular, how, the, novel, and, associated, plays, created, and, popularized, racial, stereotypes, have, to, some, extent, obscured, the, book, s, historical, impact, as, a, vital, antislavery, tool, after, the, turn, of, the, millennium, scholars, such, as, henry, louis, gates, jr, and, hollis, robbins, have, re, examined, uncle, tom, s, cabin, in, what, has, been, called, a, serious, attempt, to, resurrect, it, as, both, a, central, document, in, american, race, relations, and, a, significant, moral, and, political, exploration, of, the, character, of, those, relations, in, china, uncle, tom, s, cabin, experienced, a, revival, of, interest, in, the, early, 1960s, 55, in, the, chinese, communist, view, of, the, book, uncle, tom, was, interpreted, as, having, been, betrayed, by, his, christian, consciousness, 55, in, 1961, sun, weishi, directed, a, stage, play, adaptation, of, the, book, 55, the, revival, of, interest, in, uncle, tom, s, cabin, intersected, with, the, translation, and, popularization, of, works, by, w, e, b, du, bois, who, was, viewed, as, having, developed, a, new, spirit, of, black, resistance, 54, 55, generally, recognized, as, the, first, best, selling, novel, uncle, tom, s, cabin, greatly, influenced, development, of, not, only, american, literature, but, also, protest, literature, in, general, later, books, that, owe, a, large, debt, to, uncle, tom, s, cabin, include, the, jungle, by, upton, sinclair, and, silent, spring, by, rachel, carson, despite, this, undisputed, significance, uncle, tom, s, cabin, has, been, called, a, blend, of, children, s, fable, and, propaganda, the, novel, has, also, been, dismissed, by, several, literary, critics, as, merely, a, sentimental, novel, critic, george, whicher, stated, in, his, literary, history, of, the, united, states, that, nothing, attributable, to, mrs, stowe, or, her, handiwork, can, account, for, the, novel, s, enormous, vogue, its, author, s, resources, as, a, purveyor, of, sunday, school, fiction, were, not, remarkable, she, had, at, most, a, ready, command, of, broadly, conceived, melodrama, humor, and, pathos, and, of, these, popular, sentiments, she, compounded, her, book, other, critics, though, have, praised, the, novel, edmund, wilson, stated, that, to, expose, oneself, in, maturity, to, uncle, tom, s, cabin, may, therefore, prove, a, startling, experience, it, is, a, much, more, impressive, work, than, one, has, ever, been, allowed, to, suspect, jane, tompkins, stated, that, the, novel, is, one, of, the, classics, of, american, literature, and, wonders, if, many, literary, critics, dismiss, the, book, because, it, was, simply, too, popular, during, its, day, many, modern, scholars, and, readers, have, criticized, the, book, for, condescending, racist, descriptions, of, the, black, characters, appearances, speech, and, behavior, as, well, as, the, passive, nature, of, uncle, tom, in, accepting, his, fate, the, novel, s, creation, and, use, of, common, stereotypes, about, african, americans, is, significant, because, uncle, tom, s, cabin, was, the, best, selling, novel, in, the, world, during, the, 19th, century, as, a, result, the, book, along, with, illustrations, from, the, book, and, associated, stage, productions, played, a, major, role, in, perpetuating, and, solidifying, such, stereotypes, into, the, american, psyche, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, the, black, power, and, black, arts, movements, attacked, the, novel, claiming, that, the, character, of, uncle, tom, engaged, in, race, betrayal, and, that, tom, made, slaves, out, to, be, worse, than, slave, owners, among, the, stereotypes, of, blacks, in, uncle, tom, s, cabin, are, the, happy, darky, in, the, lazy, carefree, character, of, sam, the, light, skinned, tragic, mulatto, as, a, sex, object, in, the, characters, of, eliza, cassy, and, emmeline, the, affectionate, dark, skinned, female, mammy, through, several, characters, including, mammy, a, cook, at, the, st, clare, plantation, the, pickaninny, stereotype, of, black, children, in, the, character, of, topsy, the, uncle, tom, an, african, american, who, is, too, eager, to, please, white, people, stowe, intended, tom, to, be, a, noble, hero, and, a, christ, like, figure, who, like, jesus, at, his, crucifixion, forgives, the, people, responsible, for, his, death, the, false, stereotype, of, tom, as, a, subservient, fool, who, bows, down, to, the, white, man, and, the, resulting, derogatory, term, uncle, tom, resulted, from, staged, tom, shows, which, sometimes, replaced, tom, s, grim, death, with, an, upbeat, ending, where, tom, causes, his, oppressors, to, see, the, error, of, their, ways, and, they, all, reconcile, happily, stowe, had, no, control, over, these, shows, and, their, alteration, of, her, story, in, response, to, uncle, tom, s, cabin, writers, in, the, southern, united, states, produced, a, number, of, books, to, rebut, stowe, s, novel, this, so, called, anti, tom, literature, generally, took, a, pro, slavery, viewpoint, arguing, that, the, issues, of, slavery, as, depicted, in, stowe, s, book, were, overblown, and, incorrect, the, novels, in, this, genre, tended, to, feature, a, benign, white, patriarchal, master, and, a, pure, wife, both, of, whom, presided, over, childlike, slaves, in, a, benevolent, extended, family, style, plantation, the, novels, either, implied, or, directly, stated, that, african, americans, were, a, childlike, people, unable, to, live, their, lives, without, being, directly, overseen, by, white, people, among, the, most, famous, anti, tom, books, are, the, sword, and, the, distaff, by, william, gilmore, simms, aunt, phillis, s, cabin, by, mary, henderson, eastman, and, the, planter, s, northern, bride, by, caroline, lee, hentz, with, the, last, author, having, been, a, close, personal, friend, of, stowe, s, when, the, two, lived, in, cincinnati, simms, book, was, published, a, few, months, after, stowe, s, novel, and, it, contains, a, number, of, sections, and, discussions, disputing, stowe, s, book, and, her, view, of, slavery, hentz, s, 1854, novel, widely, read, at, the, time, but, now, largely, forgotten, offers, a, defense, of, slavery, as, seen, through, the, eyes, of, a, northern, woman, the, daughter, of, an, abolitionist, no, less, who, marries, a, southern, slave, owner, in, the, decade, between, the, publication, of, uncle, tom, s, cabin, and, the, start, of, the, american, civil, war, between, twenty, and, thirty, anti, tom, books, were, published, although, others, continued, to, be, published, after, the, war, including, the, leopard, s, spots, in, 1902, by, professional, racist, thomas, dixon, jr, more, than, half, of, these, anti, tom, books, were, written, by, white, women, simms, commenting, at, one, point, about, the, seemingly, poetic, justice, of, having, the, northern, woman, stowe, answered, by, a, southern, woman, even, though, uncle, tom, s, cabin, was, the, best, selling, novel, of, the, 19th, century, far, more, americans, of, that, time, saw, the, story, as, a, stage, play, or, musical, than, read, the, book, historian, eric, lott, estimated, that, for, every, one, of, the, three, hundred, thousand, who, bought, the, novel, in, its, first, year, many, more, eventually, saw, the, play, in, 1902, it, was, reported, that, by, a, quarter, million, of, these, presentations, had, already, been, performed, in, the, united, states, given, the, lax, copyright, laws, of, the, time, stage, plays, based, on, uncle, tom, s, cabin, tom, shows, began, to, appear, while, the, novel, was, still, being, serialized, stowe, refused, to, authorize, dramatization, of, her, work, because, of, her, distrust, of, drama, although, she, did, eventually, go, to, see, george, l, aiken, s, version, and, according, to, francis, underwood, was, delighted, by, caroline, howard, s, portrayal, of, topsy, aiken, s, stage, production, was, the, most, popular, play, in, the, u, s, and, britain, for, 75, years, stowe, s, refusal, to, authorize, a, particular, dramatic, version, left, the, field, clear, for, any, number, of, adaptations, some, launched, for, various, political, reasons, and, others, as, simply, commercial, theatrical, ventures, no, international, copyright, laws, existed, at, the, time, the, book, and, plays, were, translated, into, several, languages, stowe, received, no, money, which, could, have, meant, as, much, as, three, fourths, of, her, just, and, legitimate, wages, all, the, tom, shows, appear, to, have, incorporated, elements, of, melodrama, and, blackface, minstrelsy, these, plays, varied, tremendously, in, their, politics, some, faithfully, reflected, stowe, s, sentimentalized, antislavery, politics, while, others, were, more, moderate, or, even, pro, slavery, many, of, the, productions, featured, demeaning, racial, caricatures, of, black, people, some, productions, also, featured, songs, by, stephen, foster, including, my, old, kentucky, home, old, folks, at, home, and, massa, s, in, the, cold, ground, the, best, known, tom, shows, were, those, of, george, aiken, and, h, j, conway, the, many, stage, variants, of, uncle, tom, s, cabin, dominated, northern, popular, culture, for, several, years, during, the, 19th, century, and, the, plays, were, still, being, performed, in, the, early, 20th, century, uncle, tom, s, cabin, has, been, adapted, several, times, as, a, film, most, of, these, movies, were, created, during, the, silent, film, era, uncle, tom, s, cabin, was, the, most, filmed, book, of, that, time, period, because, of, the, continuing, popularity, of, both, the, book, and, tom, shows, audiences, were, already, familiar, with, the, characters, and, the, plot, making, it, easier, for, the, film, to, be, understood, without, spoken, words, the, first, film, version, of, uncle, tom, s, cabin, was, one, of, the, earliest, full, length, movies, although, full, length, at, that, time, meant, between, 10, and, 14, minutes, this, 1903, film, directed, by, edwin, s, porter, used, white, actors, in, blackface, in, the, major, roles, and, black, performers, only, as, extras, this, version, was, evidently, similar, to, many, of, the, tom, shows, of, earlier, decades, and, featured, several, stereotypes, about, blacks, such, as, having, the, slaves, dance, in, almost, any, context, including, at, a, slave, auction, in, 1910, a, three, reel, vitagraph, company, of, america, production, was, directed, by, j, stuart, blackton, and, adapted, by, eugene, mullin, according, to, the, dramatic, mirror, this, film, was, a, decided, innovation, in, motion, pictures, and, the, first, time, an, american, company, released, a, dramatic, film, in, three, reels, until, then, full, length, movies, of, the, time, were, 15, minutes, long, and, contained, only, one, reel, of, film, the, movie, starred, florence, turner, mary, fuller, edwin, r, phillips, flora, finch, genevieve, tobin, and, carlyle, blackwell, sr, at, least, four, more, movie, adaptations, were, created, in, the, next, two, decades, the, last, silent, film, version, was, released, in, 1927, directed, by, harry, a, pollard, who, played, uncle, tom, in, a, 1913, release, of, uncle, tom, s, cabin, this, two, hour, movie, was, more, than, a, year, in, production, and, was, the, third, most, expensive, picture, of, the, silent, era, at, a, cost, of, 1, 8, million, the, black, actor, charles, gilpin, was, originally, cast, in, the, title, role, but, he, was, fired, after, the, studio, decided, his, portrayal, was, too, aggressive, for, several, decades, after, the, end, of, the, silent, film, era, the, subject, matter, of, stowe, s, novel, was, judged, too, sensitive, for, further, film, interpretation, in, 1946, metro, goldwyn, mayer, considered, filming, the, story, but, ceased, production, after, protests, led, by, the, national, association, for, the, advancement, of, colored, people, film, versions, were, created, overseas, in, the, following, decades, including, a, 1965, german, language, version, and, a, tv, soap, opera, in, brazil, called, a, cabana, do, pai, tom, s, which, ran, for, 205, episodes, from, july, 1969, to, march, 1970, the, final, film, version, was, a, television, broadcast, in, 1987, directed, by, stan, lathan, and, adapted, by, john, gay, it, starred, avery, brooks, phylicia, rashad, edward, woodward, jenny, lewis, samuel, l, jackson, and, endyia, kinney, in, addition, to, film, adaptations, versions, of, uncle, tom, s, cabin, have, been, produced, in, other, formats, including, a, number, of, animated, cartoons, uncle, tom, s, cabin, also, influenced, movies, including, the, birth, of, a, nation, this, controversial, 1915, film, set, the, dramatic, climax, in, a, slave, cabin, similar, to, that, of, uncle, tom, where, several, white, southerners, unite, with, their, former, enemy, yankee, soldiers, to, defend, according, to, the, film, s, caption, their, aryan, birthright, according, to, scholars, this, reuse, of, such, a, familiar, image, of, a, slave, cabin, would, have, resonated, with, and, been, understood, by, audiences, of, the, time
