classical, music, generally, refers, to, the, art, music, of, the, western, world, considered, to, be, distinct, from, western, folk, music, or, popular, music, traditions, it, is, sometimes, distinguished, as, western, classical, music, as, the, term, classical, music, can, also, be, applied, to, non, western, art, musics, classical, music, is, often, characterized, by, formality, and, complexity, in, its, musical, form, and, harmonic, organization, particularly, with, the, use, of, polyphony, since, at, least, the, ninth, century, it, has, been, primarily, a, written, tradition, spawning, a, sophisticated, notational, system, as, well, as, accompanying, literature, in, analytical, critical, historiographical, musicological, and, philosophical, practices, a, foundational, component, of, western, culture, classical, music, is, frequently, seen, from, the, perspective, of, individual, or, groups, of, composers, whose, compositions, personalities, and, beliefs, have, fundamentally, shaped, its, history, rooted, in, the, patronage, of, churches, and, royal, courts, in, western, europe, surviving, early, medieval, music, is, chiefly, religious, monophonic, and, vocal, with, the, music, of, ancient, greece, and, rome, influencing, its, thought, and, theory, the, earliest, extant, music, manuscripts, date, from, the, carolingian, empire, 800, 888, around, the, time, which, western, plainchant, gradually, unified, into, what, is, termed, gregorian, chant, musical, centers, existed, at, the, abbey, of, saint, gall, the, abbey, of, saint, martial, and, saint, emmeram, s, abbey, while, the, 11th, century, saw, the, development, of, staff, notation, and, increasing, output, from, medieval, music, theorists, by, the, mid, 12th, century, france, became, the, major, european, musical, center, the, religious, notre, dame, school, first, fully, explored, organized, rhythms, and, polyphony, while, secular, music, flourished, with, the, troubadour, and, trouv, re, traditions, led, by, poet, musician, nobles, this, culminated, in, the, court, sponsored, french, ars, nova, and, italian, trecento, which, evolved, into, ars, subtilior, a, stylistic, movement, of, extreme, rhythmic, diversity, beginning, in, the, early, 15th, century, renaissance, composers, of, the, influential, franco, flemish, school, built, off, the, harmonic, principles, in, the, english, contenance, angloise, bringing, choral, music, to, new, standards, particularly, the, mass, and, motet, northern, italy, soon, emerged, as, the, central, musical, region, where, the, roman, school, engaged, in, highly, sophisticated, methods, of, polyphony, in, genres, such, as, the, madrigal, which, inspired, the, brief, english, madrigal, school, the, baroque, period, 1580, 1750, saw, the, relative, standardization, of, common, practice, tonality, as, well, as, the, increasing, importance, of, musical, instruments, which, grew, into, ensembles, of, considerable, size, italy, remained, dominant, being, the, birthplace, of, opera, the, soloist, centered, concerto, genre, the, organized, sonata, form, as, well, as, the, large, scale, vocal, centered, genres, of, oratorio, and, cantata, the, fugue, technique, championed, by, johann, sebastian, bach, exemplified, the, baroque, tendency, for, complexity, and, as, a, reaction, the, simpler, and, song, like, galant, music, and, empfindsamkeit, styles, were, developed, in, the, shorter, but, pivotal, classical, period, 1730, 1820, composers, such, as, wolfgang, amadeus, mozart, joseph, haydn, and, ludwig, van, beethoven, created, widely, admired, representatives, of, absolute, music, including, symphonies, string, quartets, and, concertos, the, subsequent, romantic, music, 1800, 1910, focused, instead, on, programmatic, music, for, which, the, art, song, symphonic, poem, and, various, piano, genres, were, important, vessels, during, this, time, virtuosity, was, celebrated, immensity, was, encouraged, while, philosophy, and, nationalism, were, embedded, all, aspects, that, converged, in, the, operas, of, richard, wagner, by, the, 20th, century, stylistic, unification, gradually, dissipated, while, the, prominence, of, popular, music, greatly, increased, many, composers, actively, avoided, past, techniques, and, genres, in, the, lens, of, modernism, with, some, abandoning, tonality, in, place, of, serialism, while, others, found, new, inspiration, in, folk, melodies, or, impressionist, sentiments, after, world, war, ii, for, the, first, time, audience, members, valued, older, music, over, contemporary, works, a, preference, which, has, been, catered, to, by, the, emergence, and, widespread, availability, of, commercial, recordings, trends, of, the, mid, 20th, century, to, the, present, day, include, new, simplicity, new, complexity, minimalism, spectral, music, and, more, recently, postmodern, music, and, postminimalism, increasingly, global, practitioners, from, the, americas, africa, and, asia, have, obtained, crucial, roles, while, symphony, orchestras, and, opera, houses, now, appear, across, the, world, both, the, english, term, classical, and, the, german, equivalent, klassik, developed, from, the, french, classique, itself, derived, from, the, latin, word, classicus, which, originally, referred, to, the, highest, class, of, ancient, roman, citizens, in, roman, usage, the, term, later, became, a, means, to, distinguish, revered, literary, figures, the, roman, author, aulus, gellius, commended, writers, such, as, demosthenes, and, virgil, as, classicus, by, the, renaissance, the, adjective, had, acquired, a, more, general, meaning, an, entry, in, randle, cotgrave, s, 1611, a, dictionarie, of, the, french, and, english, tongues, is, among, the, earliest, extant, definitions, translating, classique, as, classical, formall, orderlie, in, due, or, fit, ranke, also, approved, authenticall, chiefe, principall, the, musicologist, daniel, heartz, summarizes, this, into, two, definitions, 1, a, formal, discipline, and, 2, a, model, of, excellence, like, gellius, later, renaissance, scholars, who, wrote, in, latin, used, classicus, in, reference, to, writers, of, classical, antiquity, however, this, meaning, only, gradually, developed, and, was, for, a, while, subordinate, to, the, broader, classical, ideals, of, formality, and, excellence, literature, and, visual, arts, for, which, substantial, ancient, greek, and, roman, examples, existed, did, eventually, adopt, the, term, classical, as, relating, to, classical, antiquity, but, virtually, no, music, of, that, time, was, available, to, renaissance, musicians, limiting, the, connection, between, classical, music, and, the, greco, roman, world, it, was, in, 18th, century, england, that, the, term, classical, first, came, to, stand, for, a, particular, canon, of, works, in, performance, london, had, developed, a, prominent, public, concert, music, scene, unprecedented, and, unmatched, by, other, european, cities, the, royal, court, had, gradually, lost, its, monopoly, on, music, in, large, part, from, instability, that, the, commonwealth, of, england, s, dissolution, and, the, glorious, revolution, enacted, on, court, musicians, in, 1672, the, former, court, musician, john, banister, began, giving, popular, public, concerts, at, a, london, tavern, his, popularity, rapidly, inaugurated, the, prominence, of, public, concerts, in, the, london, the, conception, of, classical, or, more, often, ancient, music, emerged, which, was, still, built, on, the, principles, of, formality, and, excellence, and, according, to, heartz, civic, ritual, religion, and, moral, activism, figured, significantly, in, this, novel, construction, of, musical, taste, the, performance, of, such, music, was, specialized, by, the, academy, of, ancient, music, and, later, at, the, concerts, of, antient, music, series, where, the, work, of, select, 16th, and, 17th, composers, was, featured, especially, george, frideric, handel, in, france, the, reign, of, louis, xiv, r, 1638, 1715, saw, a, cultural, renaissance, by, the, end, of, which, writers, such, as, moli, re, jean, de, la, fontaine, and, jean, racine, were, considered, to, have, surpassed, the, achievements, of, classical, antiquity, they, were, thus, characterized, as, classical, as, was, the, music, of, jean, baptiste, lully, and, later, christoph, willibald, gluck, being, designated, as, l, op, ra, fran, aise, classique, in, the, rest, of, continental, europe, the, abandonment, of, defining, classical, as, analogous, to, the, greco, roman, world, was, slower, primarily, because, the, formation, of, canonical, repertoires, was, either, minimal, or, exclusive, to, the, upper, classes, many, european, commentators, of, the, early, 19th, century, found, new, unification, in, their, definition, of, classical, music, to, juxtapose, the, older, composers, wolfgang, amadeus, mozart, joseph, haydn, and, excluding, some, of, his, later, works, ludwig, van, beethoven, as, classical, against, the, emerging, style, of, romantic, music, these, three, composers, in, particular, were, grouped, into, the, first, viennese, school, sometimes, called, the, viennese, classics, a, coupling, that, remains, problematic, by, reason, of, none, of, the, three, being, born, in, vienna, and, the, minimal, time, haydn, and, mozart, spent, in, the, city, while, this, was, an, often, expressed, characterization, it, was, not, a, strict, one, in, 1879, the, composer, charles, kensington, salaman, defined, the, following, composers, as, classical, bach, handel, haydn, mozart, beethoven, weber, spohr, and, mendelssohn, more, broadly, some, writers, used, the, term, classical, to, generally, praise, well, regarded, outputs, from, various, composers, particularly, those, who, produced, many, works, in, an, established, genre, the, contemporary, understanding, of, the, term, classical, music, remains, vague, and, multifaceted, other, terms, such, as, art, music, canonic, music, cultivated, music, and, serious, music, are, largely, synonymous, the, term, classical, music, is, often, indicated, or, implied, to, concern, solely, the, western, world, and, conversely, in, many, academic, histories, the, term, western, music, excludes, non, classical, western, music, another, complication, lies, in, that, classical, music, is, sometimes, used, to, describe, non, western, art, music, exhibiting, similar, long, lasting, and, complex, characteristics, examples, include, indian, classical, music, i, e, carnatic, music, hindustani, music, and, odissi, music, gamelan, music, and, various, styles, of, the, court, of, imperial, china, see, yayue, for, instance, thus, in, the, later, 20th, century, terms, such, as, western, classical, music, and, western, art, music, came, in, use, to, address, this, the, musicologist, ralph, p, locke, notes, that, neither, term, is, ideal, as, they, create, an, intriguing, complication, when, considering, certain, practitioners, of, western, art, music, genres, who, come, from, non, western, cultures, complexity, in, musical, form, and, harmonic, organization, are, typical, traits, of, classical, music, the, oxford, english, dictionary, oed, offers, three, definitions, for, the, word, classical, in, relation, to, music, the, last, definition, concerns, what, is, now, termed, the, classical, period, a, specific, stylistic, era, of, european, music, from, the, second, half, of, the, 18th, century, to, the, beginning, of, the, 19th, century, the, western, classical, tradition, formally, begins, with, music, created, by, and, for, the, early, christian, church, it, is, probable, that, the, early, church, wished, to, disassociate, itself, from, the, predominant, music, of, ancient, greece, and, rome, as, it, was, a, reminder, of, the, pagan, religion, it, had, persecuted, and, by, which, it, had, been, persecuted, as, such, it, remains, unclear, as, to, what, extent, the, music, of, the, christian, church, and, thus, western, classical, music, as, a, whole, was, influenced, by, preceding, ancient, music, the, general, attitude, towards, music, was, adopted, from, the, ancient, greek, and, roman, music, theorists, and, commentators, just, as, in, greco, roman, society, music, was, considered, central, to, education, along, with, arithmetic, geometry, and, astronomy, music, was, included, in, the, quadrivium, the, four, subjects, of, the, upper, division, of, a, standard, liberal, arts, education, in, the, middle, ages, this, high, regard, for, music, was, first, promoted, by, the, scholars, cassiodorus, isidore, of, seville, and, particularly, boethius, whose, transmission, and, expansion, on, the, perspectives, of, music, from, pythagoras, aristotle, and, plato, were, crucial, in, the, development, of, medieval, musical, thought, however, scholars, medieval, music, theorists, and, composers, regularly, misinterpreted, or, misunderstood, the, writings, of, their, greek, and, roman, predecessors, this, was, due, to, the, complete, absence, of, surviving, greco, roman, musical, works, available, to, medieval, musicians, to, the, extent, that, isidore, of, seville, c, 559, 636, stated, unless, sounds, are, remembered, by, man, they, perish, for, they, cannot, be, written, down, unaware, of, the, systematic, notational, practices, of, ancient, greece, centuries, before, the, musicologist, gustave, reese, notes, however, that, many, greco, roman, texts, can, still, be, credited, as, influential, to, western, classical, music, since, medieval, musicians, regularly, read, their, works, regardless, of, whether, they, were, doing, so, correctly, however, there, are, some, indisputable, musical, continuations, from, the, ancient, world, basic, aspects, such, as, monophony, improvisation, and, the, dominance, of, text, in, musical, settings, are, prominent, in, both, early, medieval, and, music, of, nearly, all, ancient, civilizations, greek, influences, in, particular, include, the, church, modes, which, were, descendants, of, developments, by, aristoxenus, and, pythagoras, basic, acoustical, theory, from, pythagorean, tuning, as, well, as, the, central, function, of, tetrachords, ancient, greek, instruments, such, as, the, aulos, a, reed, instrument, and, the, lyre, a, stringed, instrument, similar, to, a, small, harp, eventually, led, to, several, modern, day, instruments, of, a, symphonic, orchestra, however, donald, jay, grout, notes, that, attempting, to, create, a, direct, evolutionary, connection, from, the, ancient, music, to, early, medieval, is, baseless, as, it, was, almost, solely, influenced, by, greco, roman, music, theory, not, performance, or, practice, medieval, music, includes, western, european, music, from, after, the, fall, of, the, western, roman, empire, by, 476, to, about, 1400, monophonic, chant, also, called, plainsong, or, gregorian, chant, was, the, dominant, form, until, about, 1100, christian, monks, developed, the, first, forms, of, european, musical, notation, in, order, to, standardize, liturgy, throughout, the, church, polyphonic, multi, voiced, music, developed, from, monophonic, chant, throughout, the, late, middle, ages, and, into, the, renaissance, including, the, more, complex, voicings, of, motets, during, the, earlier, medieval, period, the, vocal, music, from, the, liturgical, genre, predominantly, gregorian, chant, was, monophonic, using, a, single, unaccompanied, vocal, melody, line, polyphonic, vocal, genres, which, used, multiple, independent, vocal, melodies, began, to, develop, during, the, high, medieval, era, becoming, prevalent, by, the, later, 13th, and, early, 14th, century, notable, medieval, composers, include, hildegard, of, bingen, l, onin, p, rotin, philippe, de, vitry, guillaume, de, machaut, francesco, landini, and, johannes, ciconia, many, medieval, musical, instruments, still, exist, but, in, different, forms, medieval, instruments, included, the, flute, the, recorder, and, plucked, string, instruments, like, the, lute, as, well, early, versions, of, the, organ, and, fiddle, or, vielle, existed, medieval, instruments, in, europe, had, most, commonly, been, used, singly, often, self, accompanied, with, a, drone, note, or, occasionally, in, parts, from, at, least, as, early, as, the, 13th, century, through, the, 15th, century, there, was, a, division, of, instruments, into, haut, loud, shrill, outdoor, instruments, and, bas, quieter, more, intimate, instruments, a, number, of, instrument, have, roots, in, eastern, predecessors, that, were, adopted, from, the, medieval, islamic, world, for, example, the, arabic, rebab, is, the, ancestor, of, all, european, bowed, string, instruments, including, the, lira, rebec, and, violin, the, musical, renaissance, era, lasted, from, 1400, to, 1600, it, was, characterized, by, greater, use, of, instrumentation, multiple, interweaving, melodic, lines, and, the, use, of, earlier, forms, of, bass, instruments, social, dancing, became, more, widespread, so, musical, forms, appropriate, to, accompanying, dance, began, to, standardize, it, is, in, this, time, that, the, notation, of, music, on, a, staff, and, other, elements, of, musical, notation, began, to, take, shape, this, invention, made, possible, the, separation, of, the, composition, of, a, piece, of, music, from, its, transmission, without, written, music, transmission, was, oral, and, subject, to, change, every, time, it, was, transmitted, with, a, musical, score, a, work, of, music, could, be, performed, without, the, composer, s, presence, the, invention, of, the, movable, type, printing, press, in, the, 15th, century, had, far, reaching, consequences, on, the, preservation, and, transmission, of, music, many, instruments, originated, during, the, renaissance, others, were, variations, of, or, improvements, upon, instruments, that, had, existed, previously, some, have, survived, to, the, present, day, others, have, disappeared, only, to, be, re, created, in, order, to, perform, music, on, period, instruments, as, in, the, modern, day, instruments, may, be, classified, as, brass, strings, percussion, and, woodwind, brass, instruments, in, the, renaissance, were, traditionally, played, by, professionals, who, were, members, of, guilds, and, they, included, the, slide, trumpet, the, wooden, cornet, the, valveless, trumpet, and, the, sackbut, stringed, instruments, included, the, viol, the, rebec, the, harp, like, lyre, the, hurdy, gurdy, the, lute, the, guitar, the, cittern, the, bandora, and, the, orpharion, keyboard, instruments, with, strings, included, the, harpsichord, and, the, clavichord, percussion, instruments, include, the, triangle, the, jew, s, harp, the, tambourine, the, bells, the, rumble, pot, and, various, kinds, of, drums, woodwind, instruments, included, the, double, reed, shawm, an, early, member, of, the, oboe, family, the, reed, pipe, the, bagpipe, the, transverse, flute, the, recorder, the, dulcian, and, the, crumhorn, simple, pipe, organs, existed, but, were, largely, confined, to, churches, although, there, were, portable, varieties, printing, enabled, the, standardization, of, descriptions, and, specifications, of, instruments, as, well, as, instruction, in, their, use, vocal, music, in, the, renaissance, is, noted, for, the, flourishing, of, an, increasingly, elaborate, polyphonic, style, the, principal, liturgical, forms, which, endured, throughout, the, entire, renaissance, period, were, masses, and, motets, with, some, other, developments, towards, the, end, especially, as, composers, of, sacred, music, began, to, adopt, secular, forms, such, as, the, madrigal, for, their, own, designs, towards, the, end, of, the, period, the, early, dramatic, precursors, of, opera, such, as, monody, the, madrigal, comedy, and, the, intermedio, are, seen, around, 1597, italian, composer, jacopo, peri, wrote, dafne, the, first, work, to, be, called, an, opera, today, he, also, composed, euridice, the, first, opera, to, have, survived, to, the, present, day, notable, renaissance, composers, include, josquin, des, prez, giovanni, pierluigi, da, palestrina, john, dunstaple, johannes, ockeghem,

cipriano, de, rore, the, common, practice, period, is, typically, defined, as, the, era, between, the, formation, and, the, dissolution, of, common, practice, tonality, the, term, usually, spans, roughly, two, and, a, half, centuries, encompassing, the, baroque, classical, and, romantic, periods, baroque, music, is, characterized, by, the, use, of, complex, tonal, counterpoint, and, the, use, of, a, basso, continuo, a, continuous, bass, line, music, became, more, complex, in, comparison, with, the, simple, songs, of, all, previous, periods, the, beginnings, of, the, sonata, form, took, shape, in, the, canzona, as, did, a, more, formalized, notion, of, theme, and, variations, the, tonalities, of, major, and, minor, as, means, for, managing, dissonance, and, chromaticism, in, music, took, full, shape, during, the, baroque, era, keyboard, music, played, on, the, harpsichord, and, pipe, organ, became, increasingly, popular, and, the, violin, family, of, stringed, instruments, took, the, form, generally, seen, today, opera, as, a, staged, musical, drama, began, to, differentiate, itself, from, earlier, musical, and, dramatic, forms, and, vocal, forms, like, the, cantata, and, oratorio, became, more, common, for, the, first, time, vocalists, began, adding, ornamentals, to, the, music, the, theories, surrounding, equal, temperament, began, to, be, put, in, wider, practice, as, it, enabled, a, wider, range, of, chromatic, possibilities, in, hard, to, tune, keyboard, instruments, although, j, s, bach, did, not, use, equal, temperament, changes, in, the, temperaments, from, the, then, common, meantone, system, to, various, temperaments, that, made, modulation, between, all, keys, musically, acceptable, made, possible, his, well, tempered, clavier, baroque,

baroque, ensembles, were, much, less, standardized, a, baroque, ensemble, could, include, one, of, several, different, types, of, keyboard, instruments, e, g, pipe, organ, or, harpsichord, additional,

which, was, the, precursor, of, the, tuba, and, the, natural, horn, wind, instruments, became, more, refined, in, the, classical, era, while, double, reed, instruments, like, the, oboe, and, bassoon, became, somewhat, standardized, in, the, baroque, the, clarinet, family, of, single, reeds, was, not, widely, used, until, mozart, expanded, its, role, in, orchestral, chamber, and, concerto, settings, the, music, of, the, romantic, era, from, roughly, the, first, decade, of, the, 19th, century, to, the, early, 20th, century, was, characterized, by, increased, attention, to, an, extended, melodic, line, as, well, as, expressive, and, emotional, elements, paralleling, romanticism, in, other, art, forms, musical, forms, began, to, break, from, the, classical, era, forms, even, as, those, were, being, codified, with, free, form, pieces, like, nocturnes, fantasias, and, preludes, being, written, where, accepted, ideas, about, the, exposition, and, development, of, themes, were, ignored, or, minimized, the, music, became, more, chromatic, dissonant, and, tonally, colorful, with, tensions, with, respect, to, accepted, norms, of, the, older, forms, about, key, signatures, increasing, the, art, song, or, lied, came, to, maturity, in, this, era, as, did, the, epic, scales, of, grand, opera, ultimately, transcended, by, richard, wagner, s, ring, cycle, in, the, 19th, century, musical, institutions, emerged, from, the, control, of, wealthy, patrons, as, composers, and, musicians, could, construct, lives, independent, of, the, nobility, increasing, interest, in, music, by, the, growing, middle, classes, throughout, western, europe, spurred, the, creation, of, organizations, for, the, teaching, performance, and, preservation, of, music, the, piano, which, achieved, its, modern, construction, in, this, era, in, part, due, to, industrial, advances, in, metallurgy, became, widely, popular, with, the, middle, class, whose, demands, for, the, instrument, spurred, many, piano, builders, many, symphony, orchestras, date, their, founding, to, this, era, some, musicians, and, composers, were, the, stars, of, the, day, some, like, franz, liszt, and, niccol, paganini, fulfilled, both, roles, european, cultural, ideas, and, institutions, began, to, follow, colonial, expansion, into, other, parts, of, the, world, there, was, also, a, rise, especially, toward, the, end, of, the, era, of, nationalism, in, music, echoing, in, some, cases, political, sentiments, of, the, time, as, composers, such, as, edvard, grieg, nikolai, rimsky, korsakov, and, anton, n, dvo, k, echoed, traditional, music, of, their, homelands, in, their, compositions, in, the, romantic, era, the, modern, piano, with, a, more, powerful, sustained, tone, and, a, wider, range, took, over, from, the, more, delicate, sounding, fortepiano, in, the, orchestra, the, existing, classical, instruments, and, sections, were, retained, string, section, woodwinds, brass, and, percussion, but, these, sections, were, typically, expanded, to, make, a, fuller, bigger, sound, for, example, while, a, baroque, orchestra, may, have, had, two, double, bass, players, a, romantic, orchestra, could, have, as, many, as, ten, as, music, grew, more, expressive, the, standard, orchestral, palette, just, wasn, t, rich, enough, for, many, romantic, composers, the, families, of, instruments, used, especially, in, orchestras, grew, larger, a, process, that, climaxed, in, the, early, 20th, century, with, very, large, orchestras, used, by, late, romantic, and, modernist, composers, a, wider, array, of, percussion, instruments, began, to, appear, brass, instruments, took, on, larger, roles, as, the, introduction, of, rotary, valves, made, it, possible, for, them, to, play, a, wider, range, of, notes, the, size, of, the, orchestra, typically, around, 40, in, the, classical, era, grew, to, be, over, 100, gustav, mahler, s, 1906, symphony, no, 8, for, example, has, been, performed, with, over, 150, instrumentalists, and, choirs, of, over, 400, new, woodwind, instruments, were, added, such, as, the, contrabassoon, bass, clarinet, and, piccolo, and, new, percussion, instruments, were, added, including, xylophones, snare, drums, celestas, a, bell, like, keyboard, instrument, bells, and, triangles, large, orchestral, harps, and, even, wind, machines, for, sound, effects, saxophones, appear, in, some, scores, from, the, late, 19th, century, onwards, usually, featured, as, a, solo, instrument, rather, than, as, in, integral, part, of, the, orchestra, the, wagner, tuba, a, modified, member, of, the, horn, family, appears, in, richard, wagner, s, cycle, der, ring, des, nibelungen, it, also, has, a, prominent, role, in, anton, bruckner, s, symphony, no, 7, in, e, major, and, is, also, used, in, several, late, romantic, and, modernist, works, by, richard, strauss, b, la, bart, k, and, others, cornets, appear, regularly, in, 19th, century, scores, alongside, trumpets, which, were, regarded, as, less, agile, at, least, until, the, end, of, the, century, prominent, composers, of, this, era, include, ludwig, van, beethoven, pyotr, ilyich, tchaikovsky, fr, d, ric, chopin, hector, berlioz, franz, schubert, robert, schumann, felix, mendelssohn, franz, liszt, giuseppe, verdi, richard, wagner, johannes, brahms, alexander, scriabin, nikolai, medtner, edvard, grieg, and, johann, strauss, ii, gustav, mahler, and, richard, strauss, are, commonly, regarded, as, transitional, composers, whose, music, combines, both, late, romantic, and, early, modernist, elements, at, the, turn, of, the, century, music, was, characteristically, late, romantic, in, style, with, its, expressive, melodies, complex, harmonies, and, expansive, forms, this, era, was, marked, by, the, works, of, several, composers, who, pushed, forward, post, romantic, symphonic, writing, composers, such, as, gustav, mahler, and, richard, strauss, continued, to, develop, the, western, classical, tradition, with, expansive, symphonies, and, operas, while, the, likes, of, jean, sibelius, and, vaughan, williams, infused, their, compositions, with, nationalistic, elements, and, influences, from, folk, songs, sergei, prokofiev, began, in, this, tradition, but, soon, ventured, into, modernist, territories, at, the, same, time, the, impressionist, movement, spearheaded, by, claude, debussy, was, being, developed, in, france, with, maurice, ravel, as, another, notable, pioneer, modernist, classical, music, encompasses, many, styles, of, composition, that, can, be, characterised, as, post, romantic, impressionist, expressionist, and, neoclassical, modernism, marked, an, era, when, many, composers, rejected, certain, values, of, the, common, practice, period, such, as, traditional, tonality, melody, instrumentation, and, structure, some, music, historians, regard, musical, modernism, as, an, era, extending, from, about, 1890, to, 1930, others, consider, that, modernism, ended, with, one, or, the, other, of, the, two, world, wars, still, other, authorities, claim, that, modernism, is, not, associated, with, any, historical, era, but, rather, is, an, attitude, of, the, composer, a, living, construct, that, can, evolve, with, the, times, despite, its, decline, in, the, last, third, of, the, 20th, century, there, remained, at, the, end, of, the, century, an, active, core, of, composers, who, continued, to, advance, the, ideas, and, forms, of, modernism, such, as, pierre, boulez, pauline, oliveros, toru, takemitsu, george, benjamin, jacob, druckman, brian, ferneyhough, george, perle, wolfgang, rihm, richard, wernick, richard, wilson, and, ralph, shapey, two, musical, movements, that, were, dominant, during, this, time, were, the, impressionist, beginning, around, 1890, and, the, expressionist, that, started, around, 1908, it, was, a, period, of, diverse, reactions, in, challenging, and, reinterpreting, older, categories, of, music, innovations, that, lead, to, new, ways, of, organizing, and, approaching, harmonic, melodic, sonic, and, rhythmic, aspects, of, music, and, changes, in, aesthetic, worldviews, in, close, relation, to, the, larger, identifiable, period, of, modernism, in, the, arts, of, the, time, the, operative, word, most, associated, with, it, is, innovation, its, leading, feature, is, a, linguistic, plurality, which, is, to, say, that, no, single, music, genre, ever, assumed, a, dominant, position, the, orchestra, continued, to, grow, during, the, early, years, modernist, era, peaking, in, the, first, two, decades, of, the, 20th, century, saxophones, that, appeared, only, rarely, during, the, 19th, century, became, more, commonly, used, as, supplementary, instruments, but, never, became, core, members, of, the, orchestra, while, appearing, only, as, featured, solo, instruments, in, some, works, for, example, maurice, ravel, s, orchestration, of, modest, mussorgsky, s, pictures, at, an, exhibition, and, sergei, rachmaninoff, s, symphonic, dances, the, saxophone, is, included, in, other, works, such, as, sergei, prokofiev, s, romeo, and, juliet, suites, 1, and, 2, and, many, other, works, as, a, member, of, the, orchestral, ensemble, in, some, compositions, such, as, ravel, s, bol, ro, two, or, more, saxophones, of, different, sizes, are, used, to, create, an, entire, section, like, the, other, sections, of, the, orchestra, the, euphonium, is, featured, in, a, few, late, romantic, and, 20th, century, works, usually, playing, parts, marked, tenor, tuba, including, gustav, holst, s, the, planets, and, richard, strauss, s, ein, heldenleben, prominent, composers, of, the, early, 20th, century, include, igor, stravinsky, claude, debussy, sergei, rachmaninoff, sergei, prokofiev, arnold, schoenberg, nikos, skalkottas, heitor, villa, lobos, karol, szymanowski, anton, webern, alban, berg, c, cile, chaminade, paul, hindemith, aram, khachaturian, george, gershwin, amy, beach, b, la, bart, k, and, dmitri, shostakovich, along, with, the, aforementioned, mahler, and, strauss, as, transitional, figures, who, carried, over, from, the, 19th, century, postmodern, music, is, a, period, of, music, that, began, as, early, as, 1930, according, to, some, authorities, it, shares, characteristics, with, postmodernist, art, that, is, art, that, comes, after, and, reacts, against, modernism, some, other, authorities, have, more, or, less, equated, postmodern, music, with, the, contemporary, music, composed, well, after, 1930, from, the, late, 20th, century, through, to, the, early, 21st, century, some, of, the, diverse, movements, of, the, postmodern, contemporary, era, include, the, neoromantic, neomedieval, minimalist, and, post, minimalist, contemporary, classical, music, at, the, beginning, of, the, 21st, century, was, often, considered, to, include, all, post, 1945, musical, forms, a, generation, later, this, term, now, properly, refers, to, the, music, of, today, written, by, composers, who, are, still, alive, music, that, came, into, prominence, in, the, mid, 1970s, it, includes, different, variations, of, modernist, postmodern, neoromantic, and, pluralist, music, performers, who, have, studied, classical, music, extensively, are, said, to, be, classically, trained, this, training, may, come, from, private, lessons, from, instrument, or, voice, teachers, or, from, completion, of, a, formal, program, offered, by, a, conservatory, college, or, university, such, as, a, bachelor, of, music, or, master, of, music, degree, which, includes, individual, lessons, from, professors, in, classical, music, extensive, formal, music, education, and, training, often, to, postgraduate, level, is, required, performance, of, classical, music, repertoire, requires, a, proficiency, in, sight, reading, and, ensemble, playing, harmonic, principles, strong, ear, training, to, correct, and, adjust, pitches, by, ear, knowledge, of, performance, practice, e, g, baroque, ornamentation, and, a, familiarity, with, the, style, musical, idiom, expected, for, a, given, composer, or, musical, work, e, g, a, brahms, symphony, or, a, mozart, concerto, the, key, characteristic, of, european, classical, music, that, distinguishes, it, from, popular, music, folk, music, and, some, other, classical, music, traditions, such, as, indian, classical, music, is, that, the, repertoire, tends, to, be, written, down, in, musical, notation, creating, a, musical, part, or, score, this, score, typically, determines, details, of, rhythm, pitch, and, where, two, or, more, musicians, whether, singers, or, instrumentalists, are, involved, how, the, various, parts, are, coordinated, the, written, quality, of, the, music, has, enabled, a, high, level, of, complexity, within, them, fugues, for, instance, achieve, a, remarkable, marriage, of, boldly, distinctive, melodic, lines, weaving, in, counterpoint, yet, creating, a, coherent, harmonic, logic, the, use, of, written, notation, also, preserves, a, record, of, the, works, and, enables, classical, musicians, to, perform, music, from, many, centuries, ago, although, classical, music, in, the, 2000s, has, lost, most, of, its, tradition, for, musical, improvisation, from, the, baroque, era, to, the, romantic, era, there, are, examples, of, performers, who, could, improvise, in, the, style, of, their, era, in, the, baroque, era, organ, performers, would, improvise, preludes, keyboard, performers, playing, harpsichord, would, improvise, chords, from, the, figured, bass, symbols, beneath, the, bass, notes, of, the, basso, continuo, part, and, both, vocal, and, instrumental, performers, would, improvise, musical, ornaments, johann, sebastian, bach, was, particularly, noted, for, his, complex, improvisations, during, the, classical, era, the, composer, performer, wolfgang, amadeus, mozart, was, noted, for, his, ability, to, improvise, melodies, in, different, styles, during, the, classical, era, some, virtuoso, soloists, would, improvise, the, cadenza, sections, of, a, concerto, during, the, romantic, era, ludwig, van, beethoven, would, improvise, at, the, piano, almost, all, of, the, composers, who, are, described, in, music, textbooks, on, classical, music, and, whose, works, are, widely, performed, as, part, of, the, standard, concert, repertoire, are, male, composers, even, though, there, have, been, a, large, number, of, women, composers, throughout, the, history, of, classical, music, musicologist, marcia, citron, has, asked, hy, is, music, composed, by, women, so, marginal, to, the, standard, classical, repertoire, citron, examines, the, practices, and, attitudes, that, have, led, to, the, exclusion, of, women, composers, from, the, received, canon, of, performed, musical, works, she, argues, that, in, the, 1800s, women, composers, typically, wrote, art, songs, for, performance, in, small, recitals, rather, than, symphonies, intended, for, performance, with, an, orchestra, in, a, large, hall, with, the, latter, works, being, seen, as, the, most, important, genre, for, composers, since, women, composers, did, not, write, many, symphonies, they, were, deemed, not, to, be, notable, as, composers, in, the, concise, oxford, history, of, music, clara, s, humann, is, one, of, the, only, female, composers, mentioned, abbey, philips, states, that, uring, the, 20th, century, the, women, who, were, composing, playing, gained, far, less, attention, than, their, male, counterparts, historically, major, professional, orchestras, have, been, mostly, or, entirely, composed, of, musicians, who, are, men, some, of, the, earliest, cases, of, women, being, hired, in, professional, orchestras, was, in, the, position, of, harpist, the, vienna, philharmonic, for, example, did, not, accept, women, to, permanent, membership, until, 1997, far, later, than, the, other, orchestras, ranked, among, the, world, s, top, five,

gradually, shift, classical, music, has, often, incorporated, elements, or, material, from, popular, music, of, the, composer, s, time, examples, include, occasional, music, such, as, brahms, use, of, student, drinking, songs, in, his, academic, festival, overture, genres, exemplified, by, kurt, weill, s, the, threepenny, opera, and, the, influence, of, jazz, on, early, and, mid, 20th, century,
