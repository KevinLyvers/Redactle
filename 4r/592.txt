a, film, british, english, also, called, a, movie, american, english, motion, picture, moving, picture, picture, photoplay, or, flick, is, a, work, of, visual, art, that, simulates, experiences, and, otherwise, communicates, ideas, stories, perceptions, emotions, or, atmosphere, through, the, use, of, moving, images, that, are, generally, accompanied, by, sound, and, less, commonly, other, sensory, stimulations, the, word, cinema, is, a, shortening, of, the, word, cinematography, and, is, used, to, refer, to, either, filmmaking, the, film, industry, the, overall, art, form, or, a, movie, theater, the, moving, images, of, a, film, are, created, by, photographing, actual, scenes, with, a, motion, picture, camera, by, photographing, drawings, or, miniature, models, using, traditional, animation, techniques, by, means, of, cgi, and, computer, animation, or, by, a, combination, of, some, or, all, of, these, techniques, and, other, visual, effects, before, the, introduction, of, digital, production, a, series, of, still, images, were, recorded, on, a, strip, of, chemically, sensitized, celluloid, photographic, film, stock, usually, at, a, rate, of, 24, frames, per, second, the, images, are, transmitted, through, a, movie, projector, at, the, same, rate, as, they, were, recorded, with, a, geneva, drive, ensuring, that, each, frame, remains, still, during, its, short, projection, time, a, rotating, shutter, causes, stroboscopic, intervals, of, darkness, but, the, viewer, does, not, notice, the, interruptions, due, to, flicker, fusion, the, apparent, motion, on, the, screen, is, the, result, of, the, fact, that, the, visual, sense, cannot, discern, the, individual, images, at, high, speeds, so, the, impressions, of, the, images, blend, with, the, dark, intervals, and, are, thus, linked, together, to, produce, the, illusion, of, one, moving, image, an, analogous, optical, soundtrack, a, graphic, recording, of, the, spoken, words, music, and, other, sounds, runs, along, a, portion, of, the, film, exclusively, reserved, for, it, and, was, not, projected, contemporary, films, are, usually, fully, digital, through, the, entire, process, of, production, distribution, and, exhibition, the, name, film, originally, referred, to, the, thin, layer, of, photochemical, emulsion, on, the, celluloid, strip, that, used, to, be, the, actual, medium, for, recording, and, displaying, motion, pictures, many, other, terms, exist, for, an, individual, motion, picture, including, picture, picture, show, moving, picture, photoplay, and, flick, the, most, common, term, in, the, united, states, is, movie, while, in, europe, film, is, preferred, archaic, terms, include, animated, pictures, and, animated, photography, flick, is, in, general, a, slang, term, first, recorded, in, 1926, it, originates, in, the, verb, flicker, owing, to, the, flickering, appearance, of, early, films, common, terms, for, the, field, in, general, include, the, big, screen, the, movies, the, silver, screen, and, cinema, the, last, of, these, is, commonly, used, as, an, overarching, term, in, scholarly, texts, and, critical, essays, in, the, early, years, the, word, sheet, was, sometimes, used, instead, of, screen, the, art, of, film, has, drawn, on, several, earlier, traditions, in, fields, such, as, oral, storytelling, literature, theatre, and, visual, arts, forms, of, art, and, entertainment, that, had, already, featured, moving, or, projected, images, include, the, stroboscopic, animation, principle, was, introduced, in, 1833, with, the, stroboscopic, disc, better, known, as, the, ph, nakisticope, and, later, applied, in, the, zoetrope, since, 1866, the, flip, book, since, 1868, and, the, praxinoscope, since, 1877, before, it, became, the, basic, principle, for, cinematography, experiments, with, early, ph, nakisticope, based, animation, projectors, were, made, at, least, as, early, as, 1843, and, publicly, screened, in, 1847, jules, duboscq, marketed, ph, nakisticope, projection, systems, in, france, from, c, 1853, until, the, 1890s, photography, was, introduced, in, 1839, but, initially, photographic, emulsions, needed, such, long, exposures, that, the, recording, of, moving, subjects, seemed, impossible, at, least, as, early, as, 1844, photographic, series, of, subjects, posed, in, different, positions, were, created, to, either, suggest, a, motion, sequence, or, document, a, range, of, different, viewing, angles, the, advent, of, stereoscopic, photography, with, early, experiments, in, the, 1840s, and, commercial, success, since, the, early, 1850s, raised, interest, in, completing, the, photographic, medium, with, the, addition, of, means, to, capture, colour, and, motion, in, 1849, joseph, plateau, published, about, the, idea, to, combine, his, invention, of, the, ph, nakisticope, with, the, stereoscope, as, suggested, to, him, by, stereoscope, inventor, charles, wheatstone, and, to, use, photographs, of, plaster, sculptures, in, different, positions, to, be, animated, in, the, combined, device, in, 1852, jules, duboscq, patented, such, an, instrument, as, the, st, r, oscope, fantascope, ou, b, oscope, but, he, only, marketed, it, very, briefly, without, success, one, b, oscope, disc, with, stereoscopic, photographs, of, a, machine, is, in, the, plateau, collection, of, ghent, university, but, no, instruments, or, other, discs, have, yet, been, found, by, the, late, 1850s, the, first, examples, of, instantaneous, photography, came, about, and, provided, hope, that, motion, photography, would, soon, be, possible, but, it, took, a, few, decades, before, it, was, successfully, combined, with, a, method, to, record, series, of, sequential, images, in, real, time, in, 1878, eadweard, muybridge, eventually, managed, to, take, a, series, of, photographs, of, a, running, horse, with, a, battery, of, cameras, in, a, line, along, the, track, and, published, the, results, as, the, horse, in, motion, on, cabinet, cards, muybridge, as, well, as, tienne, jules, marey, ottomar, ansch, tz, and, many, others, would, create, many, more, chronophotography, studies, muybridge, had, the, contours, of, dozens, of, his, chronophotographic, series, traced, onto, glass, discs, and, projected, them, with, his, zoopraxiscope, in, his, lectures, from, 1880, to, 1895, ansch, tz, made, his, first, instantaneous, photographs, in, 1881, he, developed, a, portable, camera, that, allowed, shutter, speeds, as, short, as, 1, 1000, of, a, second, in, 1882, the, quality, of, his, pictures, was, generally, regarded, as, much, higher, than, that, of, the, chronophotography, works, of, muybridge, and, tienne, jules, marey, in, 1886, ansch, tz, developed, the, electrotachyscope, an, early, device, that, displayed, short, motion, picture, loops, with, 24, glass, plate, photographs, on, a, 1, 5, meter, wide, rotating, wheel, that, was, hand, cranked, to, a, speed, of, circa, 30, frames, per, second, different, versions, were, shown, at, many, international, exhibitions, fairs, conventions, and, arcades, from, 1887, until, at, least, 1894, starting, in, 1891, some, 152, examples, of, a, coin, operated, peep, box, electrotachyscope, model, were, manufactured, by, siemens, halske, in, berlin, and, sold, internationally, nearly, 34, 000, people, paid, to, see, it, at, the, berlin, exhibition, park, in, the, summer, of, 1892, others, saw, it, in, london, or, at, the, 1893, chicago, world, s, fair, on, 25, november, 1894, ansch, tz, introduced, a, electrotachyscope, projector, with, a, 6x8, meter, screening, in, berlin, between, 22, february, and, 30, march, 1895, a, total, of, circa, 7, 000, paying, customers, came, to, view, a, 1, 5, hour, show, of, some, 40, scenes, at, a, 300, seat, hall, in, the, old, reichstag, building, in, berlin, mile, reynaud, already, mentioned, the, possibility, of, projecting, the, images, of, the, praxinoscope, in, his, 1877, patent, application, he, presented, a, praxinoscope, projection, device, at, the, soci, t, fran, aise, de, photographie, on, 4, june, 1880, but, did, not, market, his, praxinoscope, a, projection, before, 1882, he, then, further, developed, the, device, into, the, th, tre, optique, which, could, project, longer, sequences, with, separate, backgrounds, patented, in, 1888, he, created, several, movies, for, the, machine, by, painting, images, on, hundreds, of, gelatin, plates, that, were, mounted, into, cardboard, frames, and, attached, to, a, cloth, band, from, 28, october, 1892, to, march, 1900, reynaud, gave, over, 12, 800, shows, to, a, total, of, over, 500, 000, visitors, at, the, mus, e, gr, vin, in, paris, by, the, end, of, the, 1880s, the, introduction, of, lengths, of, celluloid, photographic, film, and, the, invention, of, motion, picture, cameras, which, could, photograph, a, rapid, sequence, of, images, using, only, one, lens, allowed, action, to, be, captured, and, stored, on, a, single, compact, reel, of, film, movies, were, initially, shown, publicly, to, one, person, at, a, time, through, peep, show, devices, such, as, the, electrotachyscope, kinetoscope, and, the, mutoscope, not, much, later, exhibitors, managed, to, project, films, on, large, screens, for, theatre, audiences, the, first, public, screenings, of, films, at, which, admission, was, charged, were, made, in, 1895, by, the, american, woodville, latham, and, his, sons, using, films, produced, by, their, eidoloscope, company, by, the, skladanowsky, brothers, and, by, the, arguably, better, known, french, brothers, auguste, and, louis, lumi, re, with, ten, of, their, own, productions, private, screenings, had, preceded, these, by, several, months, with, latham, s, slightly, predating, the, otherss, the, earliest, films, were, simply, one, static, shot, that, showed, an, event, or, action, with, no, editing, or, other, cinematic, techniques, typical, films, showed, employees, leaving, a, factory, gate, people, walking, in, the, street, and, the, view, from, the, front, of, a, trolley, as, it, traveled, a, city, s, main, street, according, to, legend, when, a, film, showed, a, locomotive, at, high, speed, approaching, the, audience, the, audience, panicked, and, ran, from, the, theater, around, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, films, started, stringing, several, scenes, together, to, tell, a, story, the, filmmakers, who, first, put, several, shots, or, scenes, discovered, that, when, one, shot, follows, another, that, act, establishes, a, relationship, between, the, content, in, the, separate, shots, in, the, minds, of, the, viewer, it, is, this, relationship, that, makes, all, film, storytelling, possible, in, a, simple, example, if, a, person, is, shown, looking, out, a, window, whatever, the, next, shot, shows, it, will, be, regarded, as, the, view, the, person, was, seeing, each, scene, was, a, single, stationary, shot, with, the, action, occurring, before, it, the, scenes, were, later, broken, up, into, multiple, shots, photographed, from, different, distances, and, angles, other, techniques, such, as, camera, movement, were, developed, as, effective, ways, to, tell, a, story, with, film, until, sound, film, became, commercially, practical, in, the, late, 1920s, motion, pictures, were, a, purely, visual, art, but, these, innovative, silent, films, had, gained, a, hold, on, the, public, imagination, rather, than, leave, audiences, with, only, the, noise, of, the, projector, as, an, accompaniment, theater, owners, hired, a, pianist, or, organist, or, in, large, urban, theaters, a, full, orchestra, to, play, music, that, fit, the, mood, of, the, film, at, any, given, moment, by, the, early, 1920s, most, films, came, with, a, prepared, list, of, sheet, music, to, be, used, for, this, purpose, and, complete, film, scores, were, composed, for, major, productions, the, rise, of, european, cinema, was, interrupted, by, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, while, the, film, industry, in, the, united, states, flourished, with, the, rise, of, hollywood, typified, most, prominently, by, the, innovative, work, of, d, w, griffith, in, the, birth, of, a, nation, 1915, and, intolerance, 1916, however, in, the, 1920s, european, filmmakers, such, as, eisenstein, f, w, murnau, and, fritz, lang, in, many, ways, inspired, by, the, meteoric, wartime, progress, of, film, through, griffith, along, with, the, contributions, of, charles, chaplin, buster, keaton, and, others, quickly, caught, up, with, american, film, making, and, continued, to, further, advance, the, medium, in, the, 1920s, the, development, of, electronic, sound, recording, technologies, made, it, practical, to, incorporate, a, soundtrack, of, speech, music, and, sound, effects, synchronized, with, the, action, on, the, screen, the, resulting, sound, films, were, initially, distinguished, from, the, usual, silent, moving, pictures, or, movies, by, calling, them, talking, pictures, or, talkies, the, revolution, they, wrought, was, swift, by, 1930, silent, film, was, practically, extinct, in, the, us, and, already, being, referred, to, as, the, old, medium, the, evolution, of, sound, in, cinema, began, with, the, idea, of, combining, moving, images, with, existing, phonograph, sound, technology, early, sound, film, systems, such, as, thomas, edison, s, kinetoscope, and, the, vitaphone, used, by, warner, bros, laid, the, groundwork, for, synchronized, sound, in, film, the, vitaphone, system, produced, alongside, bell, telephone, company, and, western, electric, faced, initial, resistance, due, to, expensive, equipping, costs, but, sound, in, cinema, gained, acceptance, with, movies, like, don, juan, 1926, and, the, jazz, singer, 1927, american, film, studios, while, europe, standardized, on, tobis, klangfilm, and, tri, ergon, systems, this, new, technology, allowed, for, greater, fluidity, in, film, giving, rise, to, more, complex, and, epic, movies, like, king, kong, 1933, as, the, television, threat, emerged, in, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, the, film, industry, needed, to, innovate, to, attract, audiences, in, terms, of, sound, technology, this, meant, the, development, of, surround, sound, and, more, sophisticated, audio, systems, such, as, cinerama, s, seven, channel, system, however, these, advances, required, a, large, number, of, personnel, to, operate, the, equipment, and, maintain, the, sound, experience, in, theaters, in, 1966, dolby, laboratories, introduced, the, dolby, a, noise, reduction, system, which, became, a, standard, in, the, recording, industry, and, eliminated, the, hissing, sound, associated, with, earlier, standardization, efforts, dolby, stereo, a, revolutionary, surround, sound, system, followed, and, allowed, cinema, designers, to, take, acoustics, into, consideration, when, designing, theaters, this, innovation, enabled, audiences, in, smaller, venues, to, enjoy, comparable, audio, experiences, to, those, in, larger, city, theaters, today, the, future, of, sound, in, film, remains, uncertain, with, potential, influences, from, artificial, intelligence, remastered, audio, and, personal, viewing, experiences, shaping, its, development, however, it, is, clear, that, the, evolution, of, sound, in, cinema, has, been, marked, by, continuous, innovation, and, a, desire, to, create, more, immersive, and, engaging, experiences, for, audiences, a, significant, technological, advancement, in, film, was, the, introduction, of, natural, color, where, color, was, captured, directly, from, nature, through, photography, as, opposed, to, being, manually, added, to, black, and, white, prints, using, techniques, like, hand, coloring, or, stencil, coloring, early, color, processes, often, produced, colors, that, appeared, far, from, natural, unlike, the, rapid, transition, from, silent, films, to, sound, films, color, s, replacement, of, black, and, white, happened, more, gradually, the, crucial, innovation, was, the, three, strip, version, of, the, technicolor, process, first, used, in, animated, cartoons, in, 1932, the, process, was, later, applied, to, live, action, short, films, specific, sequences, in, feature, films, and, finally, for, an, entire, feature, film, becky, sharp, in, 1935, although, the, process, was, expensive, the, positive, public, response, as, evidenced, by, increased, box, office, revenue, generally, justified, the, additional, cost, consequently, the, number, of, films, made, in, color, gradually, increased, year, after, year, in, the, early, 1950s, the, proliferation, of, black, and, white, television, started, seriously, depressing, north, american, theater, attendance, in, an, attempt, to, lure, audiences, back, into, theaters, bigger, screens, were, installed, widescreen, processes, polarized, 3d, projection, and, stereophonic, sound, were, introduced, and, more, films, were, made, in, color, which, soon, became, the, rule, rather, than, the, exception, some, important, mainstream, hollywood, films, were, still, being, made, in, black, and, white, as, late, as, the, mid, 1960s, but, they, marked, the, end, of, an, era, color, television, receivers, had, been, available, in, the, us, since, the, mid, 1950s, but, at, first, they, were, very, expensive, and, few, broadcasts, were, in, color, during, the, 1960s, prices, gradually, came, down, color, broadcasts, became, common, and, sales, boomed, the, overwhelming, public, verdict, in, favor, of, color, was, clear, after, the, final, flurry, of, black, and, white, films, had, been, released, in, mid, decade, all, hollywood, studio, productions, were, filmed, in, color, with, the, usual, exceptions, made, only, at, the, insistence, of, star, filmmakers, such, as, peter, bogdanovich, and, martin, scorsese, the, decades, following, the, decline, of, the, studio, system, in, the, 1960s, saw, changes, in, the, production, and, style, of, film, various, new, wave, movements, including, the, french, new, wave, new, german, cinema, wave, indian, new, wave, japanese, new, wave, new, hollywood, and, egyptian, new, wave, and, the, rise, of, film, school, educated, independent, filmmakers, contributed, to, the, changes, the, medium, experienced, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 20th, century, digital, technology, has, been, the, driving, force, for, change, throughout, the, 1990s, and, into, the, 2000s, digital, 3d, projection, largely, replaced, earlier, problem, prone, 3d, film, systems, and, has, become, popular, in, the, early, 2010s, film, theory, seeks, to, develop, concise, and, systematic, concepts, that, apply, to, the, study, of, film, as, art, the, concept, of, film, as, an, art, form, began, in, 1911, with, ricciotto, canudo, s, manifest, the, birth, of, the, sixth, art, the, moscow, film, school, the, oldest, film, school, in, the, world, was, founded, in, 1919, in, order, to, teach, about, and, research, film, theory, formalist, film, theory, led, by, rudolf, arnheim, b, la, bal, zs, and, siegfried, kracauer, emphasized, how, film, differed, from, reality, and, thus, could, be, considered, a, valid, fine, art, andr, bazin, reacted, against, this, theory, by, arguing, that, film, s, artistic, essence, lay, in, its, ability, to, mechanically, reproduce, reality, not, in, its, differences, from, reality, and, this, gave, rise, to, realist, theory, more, recent, analysis, spurred, by, jacques, lacan, s, psychoanalysis, and, ferdinand, de, saussure, s, semiotics, among, other, things, has, given, rise, to, psychoanalytic, film, theory, structuralist, film, theory, feminist, film, theory, and, others, on, the, other, hand, critics, from, the, analytical, philosophy, tradition, influenced, by, wittgenstein, try, to, clarify, misconceptions, used, in, theoretical, studies, and, produce, analysis, of, a, film, s, vocabulary, and, its, link, to, a, form, of, life, film, is, considered, to, have, its, own, language, james, monaco, wrote, a, classic, text, on, film, theory, titled, how, to, read, a, film, that, addresses, this, director, ingmar, bergman, famously, said, andrei, tarkovsky, for, me, is, the, greatest, director, the, one, who, invented, a, new, language, true, to, the, nature, of, film, as, it, captures, life, as, a, reflection, life, as, a, dream, an, example, of, the, language, is, a, sequence, of, back, and, forth, images, of, one, speaking, actor, s, left, profile, followed, by, another, speaking, actor, s, right, profile, then, a, repetition, of, this, which, is, a, language, understood, by, the, audience, to, indicate, a, conversation, this, describes, another, theory, of, film, the, 180, degree, rule, as, a, visual, story, telling, device, with, an, ability, to, place, a, viewer, in, a, context, of, being, psychologically, present, through, the, use, of, visual, composition, and, editing, the, hollywood, style, includes, this, narrative, theory, due, to, the, overwhelming, practice, of, the, rule, by, movie, studios, based, in, hollywood, california, during, film, s, classical, era, another, example, of, cinematic, language, is, having, a, shot, that, zooms, in, on, the, forehead, of, an, actor, with, an, expression, of, silent, reflection, that, cuts, to, a, shot, of, a, younger, actor, who, vaguely, resembles, the, first, actor, indicating, that, the, first, person, is, remembering, a, past, self, an, edit, of, compositions, that, causes, a, time, transition, montage, is, a, film, editing, technique, in, which, separate, pieces, of, film, are, selected, edited, and, assembled, to, create, a, new, section, or, sequence, within, a, film, this, technique, can, be, used, to, convey, a, narrative, or, to, create, an, emotional, or, intellectual, effect, by, juxtaposing, different, shots, often, for, the, purpose, of, condensing, time, space, or, information, montage, can, involve, flashbacks, parallel, action, or, the, interplay, of, various, visual, elements, to, enhance, the, storytelling, or, create, symbolic, meaning, the, concept, of, montage, emerged, in, the, 1920s, with, pioneering, soviet, filmmakers, such, as, sergei, eisenstein, and, lev, kuleshov, developing, the, theory, of, montage, eisenstein, s, film, battleship, potemkin, 1925, is, a, prime, example, of, the, innovative, use, of, montage, where, he, employed, complex, juxtapositions, of, images, to, create, a, visceral, impact, on, the, audience, as, the, art, of, montage, evolved, filmmakers, began, incorporating, musical, and, visual, counterpoint, to, create, a, more, dynamic, and, engaging, experience, for, the, viewer, the, development, of, scene, construction, through, mise, en, sc, ne, editing, and, special, effects, led, to, more, sophisticated, techniques, that, can, be, compared, to, those, utilized, in, opera, and, ballet, the, french, new, wave, movement, of, the, late, 1950s, and, 1960s, also, embraced, the, montage, technique, with, filmmakers, such, as, jean, luc, godard, and, fran, ois, truffaut, using, montage, to, create, distinctive, and, innovative, films, this, approach, continues, to, be, influential, in, contemporary, cinema, with, directors, employing, montage, to, create, memorable, sequences, in, their, films, in, contemporary, cinema, montage, continues, to, play, an, essential, role, in, shaping, narratives, and, creating, emotional, resonance, filmmakers, have, adapted, the, traditional, montage, technique, to, suit, the, evolving, aesthetics, and, storytelling, styles, of, modern, cinema, as, the, medium, of, film, continues, to, evolve, montage, remains, an, integral, aspect, of, visual, storytelling, with, filmmakers, finding, new, and, innovative, ways, to, employ, this, powerful, technique, if, a, movie, can, illuminate, the, lives, of, other, people, who, share, this, planet, with, us, and, show, us, not, only, how, different, they, are, but, how, even, so, they, share, the, same, dreams, and, hurts, then, it, deserves, to, be, called, great, roger, ebert, 1986, film, criticism, is, the, analysis, and, evaluation, of, films, in, general, these, works, can, be, divided, into, two, categories, academic, criticism, by, film, scholars, and, journalistic, film, criticism, that, appears, regularly, in, newspapers, and, other, media, film, critics, working, for, newspapers, magazines, and, broadcast, media, mainly, review, new, releases, normally, they, only, see, any, given, film, once, and, have, only, a, day, or, two, to, formulate, their, opinions, despite, this, critics, have, an, important, impact, on, the, audience, response, and, attendance, at, films, especially, those, of, certain, genres, mass, marketed, action, horror, and, comedy, films, tend, not, to, be, greatly, affected, by, a, critic, s, overall, judgment, of, a, film, the, plot, summary, and, description, of, a, film, and, the, assessment, of, the, director, s, and, screenwriters, work, that, makes, up, the, majority, of, most, film, reviews, can, still, have, an, important, impact, on, whether, people, decide, to, see, a, film, for, prestige, films, such, as, most, dramas, and, art, films, the, influence, of, reviews, is, important, poor, reviews, from, leading, critics, at, major, papers, and, magazines, will, often, reduce, audience, interest, and, attendance, the, impact, of, a, reviewer, on, a, given, film, s, box, office, performance, is, a, matter, of, debate, some, observers, claim, that, movie, marketing, in, the, 2000s, is, so, intense, well, coordinated, and, well, financed, that, reviewers, cannot, prevent, a, poorly, written, or, filmed, blockbuster, from, attaining, market, success, however, the, cataclysmic, failure, of, some, heavily, promoted, films, which, were, harshly, reviewed, as, well, as, the, unexpected, success, of, critically, praised, independent, films, indicates, that, extreme, critical, reactions, can, have, considerable, influence, other, observers, note, that, positive, film, reviews, have, been, shown, to, spark, interest, in, little, known, films, conversely, there, have, been, several, films, in, which, film, companies, have, so, little, confidence, that, they, refuse, to, give, reviewers, an, advanced, viewing, to, avoid, widespread, panning, of, the, film, however, this, usually, backfires, as, reviewers, are, wise, to, the, tactic, and, warn, the, public, that, the, film, may, not, be, worth, seeing, and, the, films, often, do, poorly, as, a, result, journalist, film, critics, are, sometimes, called, film, reviewers, critics, who, take, a, more, academic, approach, to, films, through, publishing, in, film, journals, and, writing, books, about, films, using, film, theory, or, film, studies, approaches, study, how, film, and, filming, techniques, work, and, what, effect, they, have, on, people, rather, than, having, their, reviews, published, in, newspapers, or, appearing, on, television, their, articles, are, published, in, scholarly, journals, or, up, market, magazines, they, also, tend, to, be, affiliated, with, colleges, or, universities, as, professors, or, instructors, the, making, and, showing, of, motion,

the, lumi, res, quickly, set, about, touring, the, continent, to, exhibit, the, first, films, privately, to, royalty, and, publicly, to, the, masses, in, each, country, they, would, normally, add, new, local, scenes, to, their, catalogue, and, quickly, enough, found, local, entrepreneurs, in, the, various, countries, of, europe, to, buy, their, equipment, and, photograph, export, import, and, screen, additional, product, commercially, the, oberammergau, passion, play, of, 1898, was, the, first, commercial, motion, picture, ever, produced, other, pictures, soon, followed, and, motion, pictures, became, a, separate, industry, that, overshadowed, the, vaudeville, world, dedicated, theaters, and, companies, formed, specifically, to, produce, and, distribute, films, while, motion, picture, actors, became, major, celebrities, and, commanded, huge, fees, for, their, performances, by, 1917, charlie, chaplin, had, a, contract, that, called, for, an, annual, salary, of, one,

force, in, the, industry, due, to, the, costly, and, risky, nature, of, filmmaking, many, films, have, large, cost, overruns, an, example, being, kevin, costner, s, waterworld, yet, many, filmmakers, strive, to, create, works, of, lasting, social, significance, the, academy, awards, also, known, as, the, oscars, are, the, most, prominent, film, awards, in, the, united, states, providing, recognition, each, year, to, films, based, on, their, artistic, merits, there, is, also, a, large, industry, for, educational, and, instructional, films, made, in, lieu, of, or, in, addition, to, lectures, and, texts, revenue, in, the, industry, is, sometimes, volatile, due, to, the, reliance, on, blockbuster, films, released, in, movie, theaters, the, rise, of, alternative, home, entertainment, has, raised, questions, about, the, future, of, the, cinema, industry, and, hollywood, employment, has, become, less, reliable, particularly, for, medium, and, low, budget, films, derivative, academic, fields, of, study, may, both, interact, with, and, develop, independently, of, filmmaking, as, in, film, theory, and, analysis, fields, of, academic, study, have, been, created, that, are, derivative, or, dependent, on, the, existence, of, film, such, as, film, criticism, film, history, divisions, of, film, propaganda, in, authoritarian, governments, or, psychological, on, subliminal, effects, e, g, of, a, flashing, soda, can, during, a, screening, these, fields, may, further, create, derivative, fields, such, as, a, movie, review, section, in, a, newspaper, or, a, television, guide, sub, industries, can, spin, off, from, film, such, as, popcorn, makers, and, film, related, toys, e, g, star, wars, figures, sub, industries, of, pre, existing, industries, may, deal, specifically, with, film, such, as, product, placement, and, other, advertising, within, films, the, terminology, used, for, describing, motion, pictures, varies, considerably, between, british, and, american, english, in, british, usage, the, name, of, the, medium, is, film, the, word, movie, is, understood, but, seldom, used, additionally, the, pictures, plural, is, used, somewhat,

place, where, movies, are, exhibited, may, be, called, a, cinema, or, movie, theatre, by, contrast, in, the, united, states, movie, is, the, predominant, term, for, the, medium, although, the, words, film, and, movie, are, sometimes, used, interchangeably, film, is, more, often, used, when, considering, artistic, theoretical, or, technical, aspects, the, term, movies, more, often, refers, to, entertainment, or, commercial, aspects, as, where, to, go, for, fun, evening, on, a, date, for, example, a, book, titled, how, to, understand, a, film, would, probably, be, about, the, aesthetics, or,

reel, have, had, a, rich, history, though, most, large, commercial, films, are, still, shot, on, and, distributed, to, theaters, as, 35, mm, prints, originally, moving, picture, film, was, shot, and, projected, at, various, speeds, using, hand, cranked, cameras, and, projectors, though, 1000, frames, per, minute, 16, 2, 3, frame, s, is, generally, cited, as, a, standard, silent, speed, research, indicates, most, films, were, shot, between, 16, frame, s, and, 23, frame, s, and, projected, from, 18, frame, s, on, up, often, reels, included, instructions, on, how, fast, each, scene, should, be, shown, when, synchronized, sound, film, was, introduced, in, the, late, 1920s, a, constant, speed, was, required, for, the, sound, head, 24, frames, per, second, were, chosen, because, it, was, the, slowest, and, thus, cheapest, speed, which, allowed, for, sufficient, sound, quality, the, standard, was, set, with, warner, bros, s, the, jazz, singer, and, their, vitaphone, system, in, 1927, improvements, since, the, late, 19th, century, include, the, mechanization, of, cameras, allowing, them, to, record, at, a, consistent, speed, quiet, camera, design, allowing, sound, recorded, on, set, to, be, usable, without, requiring, large, blimps, to, encase, the, camera, the, invention, of, more, sophisticated, filmstocks, and, lenses, allowing, directors, to, film, in, increasingly, dim, conditions, and, the, development, of, synchronized, sound, allowing, sound, to, be, recorded, at, exactly, the, same, speed, as, its, corresponding, action, the, soundtrack, can, be, recorded, separately, from, shooting, the, film, but, for, live, action, pictures, many, parts, of, the, soundtrack, are, usually, recorded, simultaneously, as, a, medium, film, is, not, limited, to, motion,

also, been, incorporated, into, multimedia, presentations, and, often, has, importance, as, primary, historical, documentation, however, historic, films, have, problems, in, terms, of, preservation, and, storage, and, the, motion, picture, industry, is, exploring, many, alternatives, most, films, on, cellulose, nitrate, base, have, been, copied, onto, modern, safety, films, some, studios, save, color, films, through, the, use, of, separation, masters, three, b, w, negatives, each, exposed, through, red, green, or, blue, filters, essentially, a, reverse, of, the, technicolor, process, digital, methods, have, also, been, used, to, restore, films, although, their, continued, obsolescence, cycle, makes, them, as, of, 2006, a, poor, choice, for, long, term, preservation, film, preservation, of, decaying, film, stock, is, a, matter, of, concern, to, both, film, historians, and, archivists, and, to, companies, interested, in, preserving, their, existing, products, in, order, to, make, them, available, to, future, generations, and, thereby, increase, revenue, preservation, is, generally, a, higher, concern, for, nitrate, and, single, strip, color, films, due, to, their, high, decay, rates, black, and, white, films, on, safety, bases, and, color, films, preserved, on, technicolor, imbibition, prints, tend, to, keep, up, much, better, assuming, proper, handling, and, storage, some, films, in, recent, decades, have, been, recorded, using, analog, video, technology, similar, to, that, used, in, television, production, modern, digital, video, cameras, and, digital, projectors, are, gaining, ground, as, well, these, approaches, are, preferred, by, some, film, makers, especially, because, footage, shot, with, digital, cinema, can, be, evaluated, and, edited, with, non, linear, editing, systems, nle, without, waiting, for, the, film, stock, to, be, processed, the, migration, was, gradual, and, as, of, 2005, most, major, motion, pictures, were, still, shot, on, film, independent, filmmaking, often, takes, place, outside, hollywood, or, other, major, studio, systems, an, independent, film, or, indie, film, is, a, film, initially, produced, without, financing, or, distribution, from, a, major, film, studio, creative, business, and, technological, reasons, have, all, contributed, to, the, growth, of, the, indie, film, scene, in, the, late, 20th, and, early, 21st, century, on, the, business, side, the, costs, of, big, budget, studio, films, also, lead, to, conservative, choices, in, cast, and, crew, there, is, a, trend, in, hollywood, towards, co, financing, over, two, thirds, of, the, films, put, out, by, warner, bros, in, 2000, were, joint, ventures, up, from, 10, in, 1987, a, hopeful, director, is, almost, never, given, the, opportunity, to, get, a, job, on, a, big, budget, studio, film, unless, he, or, she, has, significant, industry, experience, in, film, or, television, also, the, studios, rarely, produce, films, with, unknown, actors, particularly, in, lead, roles, before, the, advent, of, digital, alternatives, the, cost, of, professional, film, equipment, and, stock, was, also, a, hurdle, to, being, able, to, produce, direct, or, star, in, a, traditional, studio, film, but, the, advent, of, consumer, camcorders, in, 1985, and, more, importantly, the, arrival, of, high, resolution, digital, video, in, the, early, 1990s, have, lowered, the, technology, barrier, to, film, production, significantly, both, production, and, post, production, costs, have, been, significantly, lowered, in, the, 2000s, the, hardware, and, software, for, post, production, can, be, installed, in, a, commodity, based, personal, computer, technologies, such, as, dvds, firewire, connections, and, a, wide, variety, of, professional, and, consumer, grade, video, editing, software, make, film, making, relatively, affordable, since, the, introduction, of, digital, video, dv, technology, the, means, of, production, have, become, more, democratized, filmmakers, can, conceivably, shoot, a, film, with, a, digital, video, camera, and, edit, the, film, create, and, edit, the, sound, and, music, and, mix, the, final, cut, on, a, high, end, home, computer, however, while, the, means, of, production, may, be, democratized, financing, distribution, and, marketing, remain, difficult, to, accomplish, outside, the, traditional, system, most, independent, filmmakers, rely, on, film, festivals, to, get, their, films, noticed, and, sold, for, distribution, the, arrival, of, internet, based, video, websites, such, as, youtube, and, veoh, has, further, changed, the, filmmaking, landscape, enabling, indie, filmmakers, to, make, their, films, available, to, the, public, an, open, content, film, is, much, like, an, independent, film, but, it, is, produced, through, open, collaborations, its, source, material, is, available, under, a, license, which, is, permissive, enough, to, allow, other, parties, to, create, fan, fiction, or, derivative, works, rather, than, a, traditional, copyright, like, independent, filmmaking, open, source, filmmaking, takes, place, outside, hollywood, and, other, major, studio, systems, for, example, the, film, balloon, was, based, on, the, real, event, during, the, cold, war, a, fan, film, is, a, film, or, video, inspired, by, a, film, television, program, comic, book, or, a, similar, source, created, by, fans, rather, than, by, the, source, s, copyright, holders, or, creators, fan, filmmakers, have, traditionally, been, amateurs, but, some, of, the, most, notable, films, have, actually, been, produced, by, professional, filmmakers, as, film, school, class, projects, or, as, demonstration, reels, fan, films, vary, tremendously, in, length, from, short, faux, teaser, trailers, for, non, existent, motion, pictures, to, rarer, full, length, motion, pictures, film, distribution, is, the, process, through, which, a, film, is, made, available, for, viewing, by, an, audience, this, is, normally, the, task, of, a, professional, film, distributor, who, would, determine, the, marketing, strategy, of, the, film, the, media, by, which, a, film, is, to, be, exhibited, or, made, available, for, viewing, and, may, set, the, release, date, and, other, matters, the, film, may, be, exhibited, directly, to, the, public, either, through, a, movie, theater, historically, the, main, way, films, were, distributed, or, television, for, personal, home, viewing, including, on, dvd, video, or, blu, ray, disc, video, on, demand, online, downloading, television, programs, through, broadcast, syndication, etc, other, ways, of, distributing, a, film, include, rental, or, personal, purchase, of, the, film, in, a, variety, of, media, and, formats, such, as, vhs, tape, or, dvd, or, internet, downloading, or, streaming, using, a, computer, animation, is, a, technique, in, which, each, frame, of, a, film, is, produced, individually, whether, generated, as, a, computer, graphic, or, by, photographing, a, drawn, image, or, by, repeatedly, making, small, changes, to, a, model, unit, see, claymation, and, stop, motion, and, then, photographing, the, result, with, a, special, animation, camera, when, the, frames, are, strung, together, and, the, resulting, film, is, viewed, at, a, speed, of, 16, or, more, frames, per, second, there, is, an, illusion, of, continuous, movement, due, to, the, phi, phenomenon, generating, such, a, film, is, very, labor, intensive, and, tedious, though, the, development, of, computer, animation, has, greatly, sped, up, the, process, because, animation, is, very, time, consuming, and, often, very, expensive, to, produce, the, majority, of, animation, for, tv, and, films, comes, from, professional, animation, studios, however, the, field, of, independent, animation, has, existed, at, least, since, the, 1950s, with, animation, being, produced, by, independent, studios, and, sometimes, by, a, single, person, several, independent, animation, producers, have, gone, on, to, enter, the, professional, animation, industry, limited, animation, is, a, way, of, increasing, production, and, decreasing, costs, of, animation, by, using, short, cuts, in, the, animation, process, this, method, was, pioneered, by, upa, and, popularized, by, hanna, barbera, in, the, united, states, and, by, osamu, tezuka, in, japan, and, adapted, by, other, studios, as, cartoons, moved, from, movie, theaters, to, television, although, most, animation, studios, are, now, using, digital, technologies, in, their, productions, there, is, a, specific, style, of, animation, that, depends, on, film, camera, less, animation, made, famous, by, film, makers, like, norman, mclaren, len, lye, and, stan, brakhage, is, painted, and, drawn, directly, onto, pieces, of, film, and, then, run, through, a, projector
