the, 1937, american, film, make, way, for, tomorrow, directed, by, leo, mccarey, which, it, loosely, adapts, to, the, japanese, context, and, ozu, s, style, noda, a, long, time, collaborator, of, ozu, initially, suggested, the, plot, of, the, older, film, to, ozu, who, had, not, seen, it, noda, remembered, it, from, its, initial, release, in, japan, both, films, depict, an, elderly, couple, their, problems, with, family, and, travelling, to, visit, their, children, differences, include, the, older, film, taking, place, in, depression, era, us, with, the, couple, s, problem, being, economical, and, tokyo, story, taking, place, in, post, war, japan, where, the, problems, are, cultural, and, emotional, the, films, end, differently, david, bordwell, wrote, that, ozu, re, cast, the, original, film, instead, of, adapting, it, the, script, was, developed, by, ozu, and, noda, over, a, period, of, 103, days, in, a, ryokan, called, chigasakikan, in, chigasaki, kanagawa, ozu, noda, and, cinematographer, y, haru, atsuta, scouted, locations, in, tokyo, and, onomichi, for, another, month, before, shooting, started, shooting, and, editing, took, place, from, july, to, october, 1953,

same, film, crew, and, actors, he, had, worked, with, for, many, years, actor, chish, ry, said, ozu, was, always, happiest, when, finishing, the, final, draft, of, a, script, and, there, were, never, any, changes, to, the, final, draft, like, all, of, ozu, s, sound, films, tokyo, story, s, pacing, is, slow, though, ozu, called, it, his, film, that, tends, most, strongly, to, melodrama, in, his, narrative, storytelling, ozu, often, had, certain, key, scenes, take, place, off, camera, with, the, viewer, only, learning, about, them, through, the, characters, dialogue, for, example, the, train, journeys, to, and, from, tokyo, are, not, depicted, the, audience, never, sees, sh, kichi, and, tomi, visit, their, son, keiz, and, tomi, s, illness, begins, off, screen, ozu, favored, a, stationary, camera, and, believed, strongly, in, minimalism, a, distinctive, camera, style, is, used, in, which, the, camera, height, is, low, and, almost, never, moves, film, critic, roger, ebert, noted, that, the, camera, moves, once, in, the, film, which, is, more, than, usual, for, an, ozu, film, the, low, camera, positions, are, reminiscent, of, sitting, on, a, traditional, japanese, tatami, mat, ozu, rarely, shot, master, shots, and, often, broke, the, 180, degree, rule, of, filmmaking, and, screen, direction, characters, who, often, sit, side, by, side, in, scenes, often, appear, to, be, facing, the, same, direction, when, speaking, to, each, other, such, as, in, the, first, scene, with, sh, kichi, and, tomi, during, some, transitions, characters, exit, a, scene, screen, right, and, then, enter, the, next, scene, screen, right, david, desser, has, compared, the, film, s, style, and, de, emphasized, plot, to, zen, buddhism, and, the, modern, world, s, fascination, with, surface, value, and, materialism, many, of, the, transitional, shots, are, still, lifes, of, non, human, subjects, such, as, smokestacks, and, landscapes, themes, in, the, film, include, the, break, up, and, westernization, of, the, traditional, japanese, family, after, world, war, ii, and, the, inevitability, of, children, growing, apart, from, their, parents, it, contrasts, the, urban, life, of, the, children, in, tokyo, with, the, rural, life, of, their, parents, the, film, takes, place, in, 1953, post, war, japan, a, few, years, after, the, new, civil, code, of, 1948, stimulated, the, country, s, rapid, re, growth, and, embraced, western, capitalist, ideals, while, simultaneously, destroying, older, traditions, such, as, the, japanese, family, and, its, values, ozu, was, very, close, to,
