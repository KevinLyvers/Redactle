the, night, before, the, premiere, 29, october, the, opera, was, rapturously, received, as, was, often, true, of, mozart, s, work, in, prague, the, prager, oberpostamtzeitung, reported, connoisseurs, and, musicians, say, that, prague, has, never, heard, the, like, and, the, opera, is, extremely, difficult, to, perform, the, provincialnachrichten, of, vienna, reported, herr, mozart, conducted, in, person, and, was, welcomed, joyously, and, jubilantly, by, the, numerous, gathering, the, score, calls, for, double, woodwinds, two, horns, two, trumpets, three, trombones, alto, tenor, bass, timpani, basso, continuo, for, the, recitatives, and, the, usual, string, section, the, composer, also, specified, occasional, special, musical, effects, for, the, ballroom, scene, at, the, end, of, the, first, act, mozart, calls, for, two, onstage, ensembles, to, play, separate, dance, music, in, synchronization, with, the, pit, orchestra, each, of, the, three, groups, playing, in, its, own, metre, a, 3, 4, minuet, a, 2, 4, contradanse, and, a, fast, 3, 8, peasant, dance, accompanying, the, dancing, of, the, principal, characters, in, act, 2, giovanni, is, seen, to, play, the, mandolin,

accompanied, by, a, wind, chorale, of, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, and, trombones, with, cellos, and, basses, playing, from, the, string, section, mozart, also, supervised, the, vienna, premiere, of, the, work, which, took, place, on, 7, may, 1788, for, this, production, he, wrote, two, new, arias, with, corresponding, recitatives, don, ottavio, s, aria, dalla, sua, pace, k, 540a, composed, on, 24, april, for, the, tenor, francesco, morella, elvira, s, aria, in, quali, eccessi, mi, trad, quell, alma, ingrata, k, 540c, composed, on, 30, april, for, the, soprano, caterina, cavalieri, and, the, duet, between, leporello, and, zerlina, per, queste, tue, manine, k, 540b, composed, on, 28, april, he, also, made, some, cuts, in, the, finale, in, order, to, make, it, shorter, and, more, incisive, the, most, important, of, which, is, the, section, where, anna, and, ottavio, elvira, zerlina, and, masetto, leporello, reveal, their, plans, for, the, future, or, che, tutti, o, mio, tesoro, in, order, to, connect, ah, certo, l, ombra, che, l, incontr, it, must, have, been, the, ghost, she, met, directly, to, the, moral, of, the, story, questo, il, fin, di, chi, fa, mal, this, is, the, end, which, befalls, to, evildoers, mozart, composed, a, different, version, of, resti, dunque, quel, birbon, fra, proserpina, e, pluton, so, the, wretch, can, stay, down, there, with, proserpina, and, pluto, these, cuts, are, very, seldom, performed, in, theatres, or, recordings, the, opera, s, final, ensemble, was, generally, omitted, until, the, early, 20th, century, a, tradition, that, apparently, began, very, early, on, according, to, the, 19th, century, bohemian, memoirist, wilhelm, kuhe, the, final, ensemble, was, only, presented, at, the, first, performance, in, prague, then, never, heard, again, during, the, original, run, it, does, not, appear, in, the, viennese, libretto, of, 1788, thus, the, ending, of, the, first, performance, in, vienna, without, the, ensemble, as, depicted, in, the, film, amadeus, may, be, an, accurate, portrayal, nonetheless, the, final, ensemble, is, almost, invariably, performed, in, full, today, modern, productions, sometimes, include, both, the, original, aria, for, don, ottavio, il, mio, tesoro, and, its, replacement, from, the, first, production, in, vienna, that, was, crafted, to, suit, the, capabilities, of, the, tenor, francesco, morella, dalla, sua, pace, elvira, s, in, quali, eccessi, o, numi, mi, trad, quell, alma, ingrata, is, usually, retained, as, well, the, duet, per, queste, tue, manine, and, the, whole,
