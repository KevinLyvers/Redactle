the, bass, guitar, electric, bass, or, simply, bass, b, e, s, is, the, lowest, pitched, member, of, the, guitar, family, it, is, a, plucked, string, instrument, similar, in, appearance, and, construction, to, an, electric, or, acoustic, guitar, but, with, a, longer, neck, and, scale, length, the, bass, guitar, most, commonly, has, four, strings, though, five, and, six, stringed, models, are, also, relatively, popular, and, bass, guitars, with, even, more, or, fewer, strings, or, courses, have, been, built, since, the, mid, 1950s, the, bass, guitar, has, largely, come, to, replace, the, double, bass, in, popular, music, due, to, its, lighter, weight, the, inclusion, of, frets, for, easier, intonation, in, most, models, and, most, importantly, its, design, for, electric, amplification, this, is, also, because, the, double, bass, is, acoustically, compromised, for, its, range, like, the, viola, in, that, it, is, scaled, down, from, the, optimal, size, that, would, be, appropriate, for, those, low, notes, the, four, string, bass, guitar, is, usually, tuned, the, same, as, the, double, bass, which, corresponds, to, pitches, one, octave, lower, than, the, four, lowest, pitched, strings, of, a, guitar, typically, e, a, d, and, g, it, is, played, primarily, with, the, fingers, or, thumb, or, with, a, pick, the, electric, bass, guitar, is, acoustically, a, relatively, quiet, instrument, so, to, be, heard, at, a, practical, performance, volume, it, requires, external, amplification, it, can, also, be, used, in, conjunction, with, direct, input, boxes, audio, interfaces, mixing, consoles, computers, or, bass, effects, processors, that, offer, headphone, jacks, the, majority, of, bass, pickup, systems, are, electromagnetic, in, nature, according, to, the, new, grove, dictionary, of, music, and, musicians, an, electric, bass, guitar, usually, with, four, heavy, strings, tuned, e, 1, a, 1, d, 2, g, 2, it, also, defines, bass, as, bass, iv, a, contraction, of, double, bass, or, electric, bass, guitar, according, to, some, authors, the, proper, term, is, electric, bass, common, names, for, the, instrument, are, bass, guitar, electric, bass, guitar, and, electric, bass, and, some, authors, claim, that, they, are, historically, accurate, a, bass, guitar, whose, neck, lacks, frets, is, termed, a, fretless, bass, the, scale, of, a, bass, is, defined, as, the, length, of, the, freely, oscillating, strings, between, the, nut, and, the, bridge, saddles, on, a, modern, 4, string, bass, guitar, 30, 76, cm, or, less, is, considered, short, scale, 32, 81, cm, medium, scale, 34, 86, cm, standard, or, long, scale, and, 35, 89, cm, extra, long, scale, bass, pickups, are, generally, attached, to, the, body, of, the, guitar, and, located, beneath, the, strings, they, are, responsible, for, converting, the, vibrations, of, the, strings, into, analogous, electrical, signals, which, are, in, turn, passed, as, input, to, an, instrument, amplifier, bass, guitar, strings, are, composed, of, a, core, and, winding, the, core, is, a, wire, which, runs, through, the, center, of, the, string, and, is, generally, made, of, steel, nickel, or, an, alloy, the, winding, is, an, additional, wire, wrapped, around, the, core, bass, guitar, strings, vary, by, the, material, and, cross, sectional, shape, of, the, winding, common, variants, include, roundwound, flatwound, halfwound, groundwound, coated, tapewound, and, taperwound, not, to, be, confused, with, tapewound, strings, roundwound, and, flatwound, strings, feature, windings, with, circular, and, rounded, square, cross, sections, respectively, with, halfround, also, referred, to, as, halfwound, ground, wound, pressure, wound, strings, being, a, hybrid, between, the, two, coated, strings, have, their, surface, coated, with, a, synthetic, layer, while, tapewound, strings, feature, a, metal, core, with, a, non, metallic, winding, taperwound, strings, have, a, tapered, end, where, the, exposed, core, sits, on, the, bridge, saddle, without, windings, the, choice, of, winding, has, considerable, impact, on, the, sound, of, the, instrument, with, certain, winding, styles, often, being, preferred, for, certain, musical, genres, in, the, 1930s, musician, and, inventor, paul, tutmarc, of, seattle, washington, developed, the, first, electric, bass, guitar, in, its, modern, form, a, fretted, instrument, designed, to, be, played, horizontally, the, 1935, sales, catalog, for, tutmarc, s, company, audiovox, featured, his, model, 736, bass, fiddle, a, solid, bodied, electric, bass, guitar, with, four, strings, a, 30, 1, 2, inch, 775, millimetre, scale, length, and, a, single, pickup, around, 100, were, made, during, this, period, audiovox, also, sold, their, model, 236, bass, amplifier, in, the, 1950s, leo, fender, and, george, fullerton, developed, the, first, mass, produced, electric, bass, guitar, the, fender, electric, instrument, manufacturing, company, began, producing, the, precision, bass, or, p, bass, in, october, 1951, the, design, featured, a, simple, uncontoured, slab, body, design, and, a, single, coil, pickup, similar, to, that, of, a, telecaster, by, 1957, the, precision, more, closely, resembled, the, fender, stratocaster, with, the, body, edges, beveled, for, comfort, and, the, pickup, was, changed, to, a, split, coil, design, the, fender, bass, was, a, revolutionary, instrument, for, gigging, musicians, in, comparison, with, the, large, heavy, upright, bass, which, had, been, the, main, bass, instrument, in, popular, music, from, the, early, 20th, century, to, the, 1940s, the, bass, guitar, could, be, easily, transported, to, shows, when, amplified, the, bass, guitar, was, also, less, prone, than, acoustic, basses, to, unwanted, audio, feedback, the, addition, of, frets, enabled, bassists, to, play, in, tune, more, easily, than, on, fretless, acoustic, or, electric, upright, basses, and, allowed, guitarists, to, more, easily, transition, to, the, instrument, in, 1953, monk, montgomery, became, the, first, bassist, to, tour, with, the, fender, bass, in, lionel, hampton, s, postwar, big, band, montgomery, was, also, possibly, the, first, to, record, with, the, electric, bass, on, july, 2, 1953, with, the, art, farmer, septet, roy, johnson, with, lionel, hampton, and, shifty, henry, with, louis, jordan, and, his, tympany, five, were, other, early, fender, bass, pioneers, bill, black, who, played, with, elvis, presley, switched, from, upright, bass, to, the, fender, precision, bass, around, 1957, the, bass, guitar, was, intended, to, appeal, to, guitarists, as, well, as, upright, bass, players, and, many, early, pioneers, of, the, instrument, such, as, carol, kaye, joe, osborn, and, paul, mccartney, were, originally, guitarists, also, in, 1953, gibson, released, the, first, short, scale, violin, shaped, electric, bass, the, eb, 1, with, an, extendable, end, pin, so, a, bassist, could, play, it, upright, or, horizontally, in, 1958, gibson, released, the, maple, arched, top, eb, 2, described, in, the, gibson, catalog, as, a, hollow, body, electric, bass, that, features, a, bass, baritone, pushbutton, for, two, different, tonal, characteristics, in, 1959, these, were, followed, by, the, more, conventional, looking, eb, 0, bass, the, eb, 0, was, very, similar, to, a, gibson, sg, in, appearance, although, the, earliest, examples, have, a, slab, sided, body, shape, closer, to, that, of, the, double, cutaway, les, paul, special, the, fender, and,
