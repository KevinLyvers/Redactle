modern, architecture, also, called, modernist, architecture, was, an, architectural, movement, and, style, that, was, prominent, in, the, 20th, century, between, the, earlier, art, deco, and, later, postmodern, movements, modern, architecture, was, based, upon, new, and, innovative, technologies, of, construction, particularly, the, use, of, glass, steel, and, concrete, the, principle, functionalism, i, e, that, form, should, follow, function, an, embrace, of, minimalism, and, a, rejection, of, ornament, according, to, le, corbusier, the, roots, of, the, movement, were, to, be, found, in, the, works, of, eug, ne, viollet, le, duc, while, mies, van, der, rohe, was, heavily, inspired, by, karl, friedrich, schinkel, the, movement, emerged, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, and, became, dominant, after, world, war, ii, until, the, 1980s, when, it, was, gradually, replaced, as, the, principal, style, for, institutional, and, corporate, buildings, by, postmodern, architecture, modern, architecture, emerged, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, from, revolutions, in, technology, engineering, and, building, materials, and, from, a, desire, to, break, away, from, historical, architectural, styles, and, invent, something, that, was, purely, functional, and, new, the, revolution, in, materials, came, first, with, the, use, of, cast, iron, drywall, plate, glass, and, reinforced, concrete, to, build, structures, that, were, stronger, lighter, and, taller, the, cast, plate, glass, process, was, invented, in, 1848, allowing, the, manufacture, of, very, large, windows, the, crystal, palace, by, joseph, paxton, at, the, great, exhibition, of, 1851, was, an, early, example, of, iron, and, plate, glass, construction, followed, in, 1864, by, the, first, glass, and, metal, curtain, wall, these, developments, together, led, to, the, first, steel, framed, skyscraper, the, ten, story, home, insurance, building, in, chicago, built, in, 1884, by, william, le, baron, jenney, and, based, on, the, works, of, viollet, le, duc, french, industrialist, fran, ois, coignet, was, the, first, to, use, iron, reinforced, concrete, that, is, concrete, strengthened, with, iron, bars, as, a, technique, for, constructing, buildings, in, 1853, coignet, built, the, first, iron, reinforced, concrete, structure, a, four, storey, house, in, the, suburbs, of, paris, a, further, important, step, forward, was, the, invention, of, the, safety, elevator, by, elisha, otis, first, demonstrated, at, the, new, york, crystal, palace, exposition, in, 1854, which, made, tall, office, and, apartment, buildings, practical, another, important, technology, for, the, new, architecture, was, electric, light, which, greatly, reduced, the, inherent, danger, of, fires, caused, by, gas, in, the, 19th, century, the, debut, of, new, materials, and, techniques, inspired, architects, to, break, away, from, the, neoclassical, and, eclectic, models, that, dominated, european, and, american, architecture, in, the, late, 19th, century, most, notably, eclecticism, victorian, and, edwardian, architecture, and, the, beaux, arts, architectural, style, this, break, with, the, past, was, particularly, urged, by, the, architectural, theorist, and, historian, eug, ne, viollet, le, duc, in, his, 1872, book, entretiens, sur, l, architecture, he, urged, use, the, means, and, knowledge, given, to, us, by, our, times, without, the, intervening, traditions, which, are, no, longer, viable, today, and, in, that, way, we, can, inaugurate, a, new, architecture, for, each, function, its, material, for, each, material, its, form, and, its, ornament, this, book, influenced, a, generation, of, architects, including, louis, sullivan, victor, horta, hector, guimard, and, antoni, gaud, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, a, few, architects, began, to, challenge, the, traditional, beaux, arts, and, neoclassical, styles, that, dominated, architecture, in, europe, and, the, united, states, the, glasgow, school, of, art, 1896, 99, designed, by, charles, rennie, mackintosh, had, a, fa, ade, dominated, by, large, vertical, bays, of, windows, the, art, nouveau, style, was, launched, in, the, 1890s, by, victor, horta, in, belgium, and, hector, guimard, in, france, it, introduced, new, styles, of, decoration, based, on, vegetal, and, floral, forms, in, barcelona, antonio, gaudi, conceived, architecture, as, a, form, of, sculpture, the, fa, ade, of, the, casa, batll, in, barcelona, 1904, 1907, had, no, straight, lines, it, was, encrusted, with, colorful, mosaics, of, stone, and, ceramic, tiles, architects, also, began, to, experiment, with, new, materials, and, techniques, which, gave, them, greater, freedom, to, create, new, forms, in, 1903, 1904, in, paris, auguste, perret, and, henri, sauvage, began, to, use, reinforced, concrete, previously, only, used, for, industrial, structures, to, build, apartment, buildings, reinforced, concrete, which, could, be, molded, into, any, shape, and, which, could, create, enormous, spaces, without, the, need, of, supporting, pillars, replaced, stone, and, brick, as, the, primary, material, for, modernist, architects, the, first, concrete, apartment, buildings, by, perret, and, sauvage, were, covered, with, ceramic, tiles, but, in, 1905, perret, built, the, first, concrete, parking, garage, on, 51, rue, de, ponthieu, in, paris, here, the, concrete, was, left, bare, and, the, space, between, the, concrete, was, filled, with, glass, windows, henri, sauvage, added, another, construction, innovation, in, an, apartment, building, on, rue, vavin, in, paris, 1912, 1914, the, reinforced, concrete, building, was, in, steps, with, each, floor, set, back, from, the, floor, below, creating, a, series, of, terraces, between, 1910, and, 1913, auguste, perret, built, the, th, tre, des, champs, lys, es, a, masterpiece, of, reinforced, concrete, construction, with, art, deco, sculptural, bas, reliefs, on, the, fa, ade, by, antoine, bourdelle, because, of, the, concrete, construction, no, columns, blocked, the, spectator, s, view, of, the, stage, otto, wagner, in, vienna, was, another, pioneer, of, the, new, style, in, his, book, moderne, architektur, 1895, he, had, called, for, a, more, rationalist, style, of, architecture, based, on, modern, life, he, designed, a, stylized, ornamental, metro, station, at, karlsplatz, in, vienna, 1888, 89, then, an, ornamental, art, nouveau, residence, majolika, house, 1898, before, moving, to, a, much, more, geometric, and, simplified, style, without, ornament, in, the, austrian, postal, savings, bank, 1904, 1906, wagner, declared, his, intention, to, express, the, function, of, the, building, in, its, exterior, the, reinforced, concrete, exterior, was, covered, with, plaques, of, marble, attached, with, bolts, of, polished, aluminum, the, interior, was, purely, functional, and, spare, a, large, open, space, of, steel, glass, and, concrete, where, the, only, decoration, was, the, structure, itself, the, viennese, architect, adolf, loos, also, began, removing, any, ornament, from, his, buildings, his, steiner, house, in, vienna, 1910, was, an, example, of, what, he, called, rationalist, architecture, it, had, a, simple, stucco, rectangular, fa, ade, with, square, windows, and, no, ornament, the, fame, of, the, new, movement, which, became, known, as, the, vienna, secession, spread, beyond, austria, josef, hoffmann, a, student, of, wagner, constructed, a, landmark, of, early, modernist, architecture, the, palais, stoclet, in, brussels, in, 1906, 1911, this, residence, built, of, brick, covered, with, norwegian, marble, was, composed, of, geometric, blocks, wings, and, a, tower, a, large, pool, in, front, of, the, house, reflected, its, cubic, forms, the, interior, was, decorated, with, paintings, by, gustav, klimt, and, other, artists, and, the, architect, even, designed, clothing, for, the, family, to, match, the, architecture, in, germany, a, modernist, industrial, movement, deutscher, werkbund, german, work, federation, had, been, created, in, munich, in, 1907, by, hermann, muthesius, a, prominent, architectural, commentator, its, goal, was, to, bring, together, designers, and, industrialists, to, turn, out, well, designed, high, quality, products, and, in, the, process, to, invent, a, new, type, of, architecture, the, organization, originally, included, twelve, architects, and, twelve, business, firms, but, quickly, expanded, the, architects, include, peter, behrens, theodor, fischer, who, served, as, its, first, president, josef, hoffmann, and, richard, riemerschmid, in, 1909, behrens, designed, one, of, the, earliest, and, most, influential, industrial, buildings, in, the, modernist, style, the, aeg, turbine, factory, a, functional, monument, of, steel, and, concrete, in, 1911, 1913, adolf, meyer, and, walter, gropius, who, had, both, worked, for, behrens, built, another, revolutionary, industrial, plant, the, fagus, factory, in, alfeld, an, der, laine, a, building, without, ornament, where, every, construction, element, was, on, display, the, werkbund, organized, a, major, exposition, of, modernist, design, in, cologne, just, a, few, weeks, before, the, outbreak, of, the, first, world, war, in, august, 1914, for, the, 1914, cologne, exhibition, bruno, taut, built, a, revolutionary, glass, pavilion, frank, lloyd, wright, was, a, highly, original, and, independent, american, architect, who, refused, to, be, categorized, in, any, one, architectural, movement, like, le, corbusier, and, ludwig, mies, van, der, rohe, he, had, no, formal, architectural, training, from, 1887, to, 1893, he, worked, in, the, chicago, office, of, louis, sullivan, who, pioneered, the, first, tall, steel, frame, office, buildings, in, chicago, and, who, famously, stated, form, follows, function, wright, set, out, to, break, all, the, traditional, rules, he, was, particularly, famous, for, his, prairie, houses, including, the, winslow, house, in, river, forest, illinois, 1893, 94, arthur, heurtley, house, 1902, and, robie, house, 1909, sprawling, geometric, residences, without, decoration, with, strong, horizontal, lines, which, seemed, to, grow, out, of, the, earth, and, which, echoed, the, wide, flat, spaces, of, the, american, prairie, his, larkin, building, 1904, 1906, in, buffalo, new, york, unity, temple, 1905, in, oak, park, illinois, and, unity, temple, had, highly, original, forms, and, no, connection, with, historical, precedents, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, the, first, skyscrapers, began, to, appear, in, the, united, states, they, were, a, response, to, the, shortage, of, land, and, high, cost, of, real, estate, in, the, center, of, the, fast, growing, american, cities, and, the, availability, of, new, technologies, including, fireproof, steel, frames, and, improvements, in, the, safety, elevator, invented, by, elisha, otis, in, 1852, the, first, steel, framed, skyscraper, the, home, insurance, building, in, chicago, was, ten, stories, high, it, was, designed, by, william, le, baron, jenney, in, 1883, and, was, briefly, the, tallest, building, in, the, world, louis, sullivan, built, another, monumental, new, structure, the, carson, pirie, scott, and, company, building, in, the, heart, of, chicago, in, 1904, 1906, while, these, buildings, were, revolutionary, in, their, steel, frames, and, height, their, decoration, was, borrowed, from, neo, renaissance, neo, gothic, and, beaux, arts, architecture, the, woolworth, building, designed, by, cass, gilbert, was, completed, in, 1912, and, was, the, tallest, building, in, the, world, until, the, completion, of, the, chrysler, building, in, 1929, the, structure, was, purely, modern, but, its, exterior, was, decorated, with, neo, gothic, ornament, complete, with, decorative, buttresses, arches, and, spires, which, caused, it, to, be, nicknamed, the, cathedral, of, commerce, after, the, first, world, war, a, prolonged, struggle, began, between, architects, who, favored, the, more, traditional, styles, of, neo, classicism, and, the, beaux, arts, architecture, style, and, the, modernists, led, by, le, corbusier, and, robert, mallet, stevens, in, france, walter, gropius, and, ludwig, mies, van, der, rohe, in, germany, and, konstantin, melnikov, in, the, new, soviet, union, who, wanted, only, pure, forms, and, the, elimination, of, any, decoration, louis, sullivan, popularized, the, axiom, form, follows, function, to, emphasize, the, importance, of, utilitarian, simplicity, in, modern, architecture, art, deco, architects, such, as, auguste, perret, and, henri, sauvage, often, made, a, compromise, between, the, two, combining, modernist, forms, and, stylized, decoration, the, dominant, figure, in, the, rise, of, modernism, in, france, was, charles, douard, jeanerette, a, swiss, french, architect, who, in, 1920, took, the, name, le, corbusier, in, 1920, he, co, founded, a, journal, called, l, espirit, nouveau, and, energetically, promoted, architecture, that, was, functional, pure, and, free, of, any, decoration, or, historical, associations, he, was, also, a, passionate, advocate, of, a, new, urbanism, based, on, planned, cities, in, 1922, he, presented, a, design, of, a, city, for, three, million, people, whose, inhabitants, lived, in, identical, sixty, story, tall, skyscrapers, surrounded, by, open, parkland, he, designed, modular, houses, which, would, be, mass, produced, on, the, same, plan, and, assembled, into, apartment, blocks, neighborhoods, and, cities, in, 1923, he, published, toward, an, architecture, with, his, famous, slogan, a, house, is, a, machine, for, living, in, he, tirelessly, promoted, his, ideas, through, slogans, articles, books, conferences, and, participation, in, expositions, to, illustrate, his, ideas, in, the, 1920s, he, built, a, series, of, houses, and, villas, in, and, around, paris, they, were, all, built, according, to, a, common, system, based, upon, the, use, of, reinforced, concrete, and, of, reinforced, concrete, pylons, in, the, interior, which, supported, the, structure, allowing, glass, curtain, walls, on, the, fa, ade, and, open, floor, plans, independent, of, the, structure, they, were, always, white, and, had, no, ornament, or, decoration, on, the, outside, or, inside, the, best, known, of, these, houses, was, the, villa, savoye, built, in, 1928, 1931, in, the, paris, suburb, of, poissy, an, elegant, white, box, wrapped, with, a, ribbon, of, glass, windows, around, on, the, fa, ade, with, living, space, that, opened, upon, an, interior, garden, and, countryside, around, raised, up, by, a, row, of, white, pylons, in, the, center, of, a, large, lawn, it, became, an, icon, of, modernist, architecture, in, germany, two, important, modernist, movements, appeared, after, the, first, world, war, the, bauhaus, was, a, school, founded, in, weimar, in, 1919, under, the, direction, of, walter, gropius, gropius, was, the, son, of, the, official, state, architect, of, berlin, who, studied, before, the, war, with, peter, behrens, and, designed, the, modernist, fagus, turbine, factory, the, bauhaus, was, a, fusion, of, the, prewar, academy, of, arts, and, the, school, of, technology, in, 1926, it, was, transferred, from, weimar, to, dessau, gropius, designed, the, new, school, and, student, dormitories, in, the, new, purely, functional, modernist, style, he, was, encouraging, the, school, brought, together, modernists, in, all, fields, the, faculty, included, the, modernist, painters, vasily, kandinsky, joseph, albers, and, paul, klee, and, the, designer, marcel, breuer, gropius, became, an, important, theorist, of, modernism, writing, the, idea, and, construction, in, 1923, he, was, an, advocate, of, standardization, in, architecture, and, the, mass, construction, of, rationally, designed, apartment, blocks, for, factory, workers, in, 1928, he, was, commissioned, by, the, siemens, company, to, build, apartment, for, workers, in, the, suburbs, of, berlin, and, in, 1929, he, proposed, the, construction, of, clusters, of, slender, eight, to, ten, story, high, rise, apartment, towers, for, workers, while, gropius, was, active, at, the, bauhaus, ludwig, mies, van, der, rohe, led, the, modernist, architectural, movement, in, berlin, inspired, by, the, de, stijl, movement, in, the, netherlands, he, built, clusters, of, concrete, summer, houses, and, proposed, a, project, for, a, glass, office, tower, he, became, the, vice, president, of, the, german, werkbund, and, became, the, head, of, the, bauhaus, from, 1930, to, 1933, proposing, a, wide, variety, of, modernist, plans, for, urban, reconstruction, his, most, famous, modernist, work, was, the, german, pavilion, for, the, 1929, international, exposition, in, barcelona, it, was, a, work, of, pure, modernism, with, glass, and, concrete, walls, and, clean, horizontal, lines, though, it, was, only, a, temporary, structure, and, was, torn, down, in, 1930, it, became, along, with, le, corbusier, s, villa, savoye, one, of, the, best, known, landmarks, of, modernist, architecture, a, reconstructed, version, now, stands, on, the, original, site, in, barcelona, when, the, nazis, came, to, power, in, germany, they, viewed, the, bauhaus, as, a, training, ground, for, communists, and, closed, the, school, in, 1933, gropius, left, germany, and, went, to, england, then, to, the, united, states, where, he, and, marcel, breuer, both, joined, the, faculty, of, the, harvard, graduate, school, of, design, and, became, the, teachers, of, a, generation, of, american, postwar, architects, in, 1937, mies, van, der, rohe, also, moved, to, the, united, states, he, became, one, of, the, most, famous, designers, of, postwar, american, skyscrapers, expressionism, which, appeared, in, germany, between, 1910, and, 1925, was, a, counter, movement, against, the, strictly, functional, architecture, of, the, bauhaus, and, werkbund, its, advocates, including, bruno, taut, hans, poelzig, fritz, hoger, and, erich, mendelsohn, wanted, to, create, architecture, that, was, poetic, expressive, and, optimistic, many, expressionist, architects, had, fought, in, world, war, i, and, their, experiences, combined, with, the, political, turmoil, and, social, upheaval, that, followed, the, german, revolution, of, 1919, resulted, in, a, utopian, outlook, and, a, romantic, socialist, agenda, economic, conditions, severely, limited, the, number, of, built, commissions, between, 1914, and, the, mid, 1920s, as, result, many, of, the, most, innovative, expressionist, projects, including, bruno, taut, s, alpine, architecture, and, hermann, finsterlin, s, formspiels, remained, on, paper, scenography, for, theatre, and, films, provided, another, outlet, for, the, expressionist, imagination, and, provided, supplemental, incomes, for, designers, attempting, to, challenge, conventions, in, a, harsh, economic, climate, a, particular, type, using, bricks, to, create, its, forms, rather, than, concrete, is, known, as, brick, expressionism, erich, mendelsohn, who, disliked, the, term, expressionism, for, his, work, began, his, career, designing, churches, silos, and, factories, which, were, highly, imaginative, but, for, lack, of, resources, were, never, built, in, 1920, he, finally, was, able, to, construct, one, of, his, works, in, the, city, of, potsdam, an, observatory, and, research, center, called, the, einsteinium, named, in, tribute, to, albert, einstein, it, was, supposed, to, be, built, of, reinforced, concrete, but, because, of, technical, problems, it, was, finally, built, of, traditional, materials, covered, with, plaster, his, sculptural, form, very, different, from, the, austere, rectangular, forms, of, the, bauhaus, first, won, him, commissions, to, build, movie, theaters, and, retail, stores, in, stuttgart, nuremberg, and, berlin, his, mossehaus, in, berlin, was, an, early, model, for, the, streamline, moderne, style, his, columbushaus, on, potsdamer, platz, in, berlin, 1931, was, a, prototype, for, the, modernist, office, buildings, that, followed, it, was, torn, down, in, 1957, because, it, stood, in, the, zone, between, east, and, west, berlin, where, the, berlin, wall, was, constructed, following, the, rise, of, the, nazis, to, power, he, moved, to, england, 1933, then, to, the, united, states, 1941, fritz, h, ger, was, another, notable, expressionist, architect, of, the, period, his, chilehaus, was, built, as, the, headquarters, of, a, shipping, company, and, was, modeled, after, a, giant, steamship, a, triangular, building, with, a, sharply, pointed, bow, it, was, constructed, of, dark, brick, and, used, external, piers, to, express, its, vertical, structure, its, external, decoration, borrowed, from, gothic, cathedrals, as, did, its, internal, arcades, hans, poelzig, was, another, notable, expressionist, architect, in, 1919, he, built, the, gro, es, schauspielhaus, an, immense, theater, in, berlin, seating, five, thousand, spectators, for, theater, impresario, max, reinhardt, it, featured, elongated, shapes, like, stalagmites, hanging, down, from, its, gigantic, dome, and, lights, on, massive, columns, in, its, foyer, he, also, constructed, the, ig, farben, building, a, massive, corporate, headquarters, now, the, main, building, of, goethe, university, in, frankfurt, bruno, taut, specialized, in, building, large, scale, apartment, complexes, for, working, class, berliners, he, built, twelve, thousand, individual, units, sometimes, in, buildings, with, unusual, shapes, such, as, a, giant, horseshoe, unlike, most, other, modernists, he, used, bright, exterior, colors, to, give, his, buildings, more, life, the, use, of, dark, brick, in, the, german, projects, gave, that, particular, style, a, name, brick, expressionism, the, austrian, philosopher, architect, and, social, critic, rudolf, steiner, also, departed, as, far, as, possible, from, traditional, architectural, forms, his, second, goetheanum, built, from, 1926, near, basel, switzerland, and, mendelsohn, s, einsteinturm, in, potsdam, germany, were, based, on, no, traditional, models, and, had, entirely, original, shapes, after, the, russian, revolution, of, 1917, russian, avant, garde, artists, and, architects, began, searching, for, a, new, soviet, style, which, could, replace, traditional, neoclassicism, the, new, architectural, movements, were, closely, tied, with, the, literary, and, artistic, movements, of, the, period, the, futurism, of, poet, vladimir, mayakovskiy, the, suprematism, of, painter, kasimir, malevich, and, the, colorful, rayonism, of, painter, mikhail, larionov, the, most, startling, design, that, emerged, was, the, tower, proposed, by, painter, and, sculptor, vladimir, tatlin, for, the, moscow, meeting, of, the, third, communist, international, in, 1920, he, proposed, two, interlaced, towers, of, metal, four, hundred, meters, high, with, four, geometric, volumes, suspended, from, cables, the, movement, of, russian, constructivist, architecture, was, launched, in, 1921, by, a, group, of, artists, led, by, aleksandr, rodchenko, their, manifesto, proclaimed, that, their, goal, was, to, find, the, communist, expression, of, material, structures, soviet, architects, began, to, construct, workers, clubs, communal, apartment, houses, and, communal, kitchens, for, feeding, whole, neighborhoods, one, of, the, first, prominent, constructivist, architects, to, emerge, in, moscow, was, konstantin, melnikov, the, number, of, working, clubs, including, rusakov, workers, club, 1928, and, his, own, living, house, melnikov, house, 1929, near, arbat, street, in, moscow, melnikov, traveled, to, paris, in, 1925, where, he, built, the, soviet, pavilion, for, the, international, exhibition, of, modern, decorative, and, industrial, arts, in, paris, in, 1925, it, was, a, highly, geometric, vertical, construction, of, glass, and, steel, crossed, by, a, diagonal, stairway, and, crowned, with, a, hammer, and, sickle, the, leading, group, of, constructivist, architects, led, by, vesnin, brothers, and, moisei, ginzburg, was, publishing, the, contemporary, architecture, journal, this, group, created, several, major, constructivist, projects, in, the, wake, of, the, first, five, year, plan, including, colossal, dnieper, hydroelectric, station, 1932, and, made, an, attempt, to, start, the, standardization, of, living, blocks, with, ginzburg, s, narkomfin, building, a, number, of, architects, from, the, pre, soviet, period, also, took, up, the, constructivist, style, the, most, famous, example, was, lenin, s, mausoleum, in, moscow, 1924, by, alexey, shchusev, 1924, the, main, centers, of, constructivist, architecture, were, moscow, and, leningrad, however, during, the, industrialization, many, constructivist, buildings, were, erected, in, provincial, cities, the, regional, industrial, centers, including, ekaterinburg, kharkiv, or, ivanovo, were, rebuilt, in, the, constructivist, manner, some, cities, like, magnitogorsk, or, zaporizhzhia, were, constructed, anew, the, so, called, socgorod, or, socialist, city, the, style, fell, markedly, out, of, favor, in, the, 1930s, replaced, by, the, more, grandiose, nationalist, styles, that, stalin, favored, constructivist, architects, and, even, le, corbusier, projects, for, the, new, palace, of, the, soviets,

built, for, the, paris, world, exhibition, 1937, where, it, faced, the, pavilion, of, nazi, germany, by, hitler, s, architect, albert, speer, the, new, objectivity, in, german, neue, sachlichkeit, sometimes, also, translated, as, new, sobriety, is, a, name, often, given, to, the, modern, architecture, that, emerged, in, europe, primarily, german, speaking, europe, in, the, 1920s, and, 30s, it, is, also, frequently, called, neues, bauen, new, building, the, new, objectivity, took, place, in, many, german, cities, in, that, period, for, example, in, frankfurt, with, its, neues, frankfurt, project, by, the, late, 1920s, modernism, had, become, an, important, movement, in, europe, architecture, which, previously, had, been, predominantly, national, began, to, become, international, the, architects, traveled, met, each, other, and, shared, ideas, several, modernists, including, le, corbusier, had, participated, in, the, competition, for, the, headquarters, of, the, league, of, nations, in, 1927, in, the, same, year, the, german, werkbund, organized, an, architectural, exposition, at, the, weissenhof, estate, stuttgart, seventeen, leading, modernist, architects, in, europe, were, invited, to, design, twenty, one, houses, le, corbusier, and, ludwig, mies, van, der, rohe, played, a, major, part, in, 1927, le, corbusier, pierre, chareau, and, others, proposed, the, foundation, of, an, international, conference, to, establish, the, basis, for, a, common, style, the, first, meeting, of, the, congr, s, internationaux, d, architecture, moderne, or, international, congresses, of, modern, architects, ciam, was, held, in, a, chateau, on, lake, leman, in, switzerland, 26, 28, june, 1928, those, attending, included, le, corbusier, robert, mallet, stevens, auguste,

organized, in, 1930, in, brussels, by, victor, bourgeois, on, the, topic, rational, methods, for, groups, of, habitations, a, third, meeting, on, the, functional, city, was, scheduled, for, moscow, in, 1932, but, was, cancelled, at, the, last, minute, instead, the, delegates, held, their, meeting, on, a, cruise, ship, traveling, between, marseille, and, athens, on, board, they, together, drafted, a, text, on, how, modern, cities, should, be, organized, the, text, called, the, athens, charter, after, considerable, editing, by, corbusier, and, others, was, finally, published, in, 1957, and, became, an, influential, text, for, city, planners, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, the, group, met, once, more, in, paris, in, 1937, to, discuss, public, housing, and, was, scheduled, to, meet, in, the, united, states, in, 1939, but, the, meeting, was, cancelled, because, of, the, war, the, legacy, of, the, ciam, was, a, roughly, common, style, and, doctrine, which, helped, define, modern, architecture, in, europe, and, the, united, states, after, world, war, ii, the, art, deco, architectural, style, called, style, moderne, in, france, was, modern, but, it, was, not, modernist, it, had, many, features, of, modernism, including, the, use, of, reinforced, concrete, glass, steel, chrome, and, it, rejected, traditional, historical, models, such, as, the, beaux, arts, style, and, neo, classicism, but, unlike, the, modernist, styles, of, le, corbusier, and, mies, van, der, rohe, it, made, lavish, use, of, decoration, and, color, it, reveled, in, the, symbols, of, modernity, lightning, flashes, sunrises, and, zig, zags, art, deco, had, begun, in, france, before, world, war, i, and, spread, through, europe, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, it, became, a, highly, popular, style, in, the, united, states, south, america, india, china, australia, and, japan, in, europe, art, deco, was, particularly, popular, for, department, stores, and, movie, theaters, the, style, reached, its, peak, in, europe, at, the, international, exhibition, of, modern, decorative, and, industrial, arts, in, 1925, which, featured, art, deco, pavilions, and, decoration, from, twenty, countries, only, two, pavilions, were, purely, modernist, the, esprit, nouveau, pavilion, of, le, corbusier, which, represented, his, idea, for, a, mass, produced, housing, unit, and, the, pavilion, of, the, ussr, by, konstantin, melnikov, in, a, flamboyantly, futurist, style, later, french, landmarks, in, the, art, deco, style, included, the, grand, rex, movie, theater, in, paris, la, samaritaine, department, store, by, henri, sauvage, 1926, 28, and, the, social, and, economic, council, building, in, paris, 1937, 38, by, auguste, perret, and, the, palais, de, tokyo, and, palais, de, chaillot, both, built, by, collectives, of, architects, for, the, 1937, paris, exposition, internationale, des, arts, et, techniques, dans, la, vie, moderne, in, the, late, 1920s, and, early, 1930s, an, exuberant, american, variant, of, art, deco, appeared, in, the, chrysler, building, empire, state, building, and, rockefeller, center, in, new, york, city, and, guardian, building, in, detroit, the, first, skyscrapers, in, chicago, and, new, york, had, been, designed, in, a, neo, gothic, or, neoclassical, style, but, these, buildings, were, very, different, they, combined, modern, materials, and, technology, stainless, steel, concrete, aluminum, chrome, plated, steel, with, art, deco, geometry, stylized, zig, zags, lightning, flashes, fountains, sunrises, and, at, the, top, of, the, chrysler, building, art, deco, gargoyles, in, the, form, of, stainless, steel, radiator, ornaments, the, interiors, of, these, new, buildings, sometimes, termed, cathedrals, of, commerce, were, lavishly, decorated, in, bright, contrasting, colors, with, geometric, patterns, variously, influenced, by, egyptian, and, mayan, pyramids, african, textile, patterns, and, european, cathedrals, frank, lloyd, wright, himself, experimented, with, mayan, revival, in, the, concrete, cube, based, ennis, house, of, 1924, in, los, angeles, the, style, appeared, in, the, late, 1920s, and, 1930s, in, all, major, american, cities, the, style, was, used, most, often, in, office, buildings, but, it, also, appeared, in, the, enormous, movie, palaces, that, were, built, in, large, cities, when, sound, films, were, introduced, the, beginning, of, the, great, depression, in, 1929, brought, an, end, to, lavishly, decorated, art, deco, architecture, and, a, temporary, halt, to, the, construction, of, new, skyscrapers, it, also, brought, in, a, new, style, called, streamline, moderne, or, sometimes, just, streamline, this, style, sometimes, modeled, after, for, the, form, of, ocean, liners, featured, rounded, corners, strong, horizontal, lines, and, often, nautical, features, such, as, superstructures, and, steel, railings, it, was, associated, with, modernity, and, especially, with, transportation, the, style, was, often, used, for, new, airport, terminals, train, and, bus, stations, and, for, gas, stations, and, diners, built, along, the, growing, american, highway, system, in, the, 1930s, the, style, was, used, not, only, in, buildings, but, in, railroad, locomotives, and, even, refrigerators, and, vacuum, cleaners, it, both, borrowed, from, industrial, design, and, influenced, it, in, the, united, states, the, great, depression, led, to, a, new, style, for, government, buildings, sometimes, called, pwa, moderne, for, the, public, works, administration, which, launched, gigantic, construction, programs, in, the, u, s, to, stimulate, employment, it, was, essentially, classical, architecture, stripped, of, ornament, and, was, employed, in, state, and, federal, buildings, from, post, offices, to, the, largest, office, building, in, the, world, at, that, time, pentagon, 1941, 43, begun, just, before, the, united, states, entered, the, second, world, war, during, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, frank, lloyd, wright, resolutely, refused, to, associate, himself, with, any, architectural, movements, he, considered, his, architecture, to, be, entirely, unique, and, his, own, between, 1916, and, 1922, he, broke, away, from, his, earlier, prairie, house, style, and, worked, instead, on, houses, decorated, with, textured, blocks, of, cement, this, became, known, as, his, mayan, style, after, the, pyramids, of, the, ancient, mayan, civilization, he, experimented, for, a, time, with, modular, mass, produced, housing, he, identified, his, architecture, as, usonian, a, combination, of, usa, utopian, and, organic, social, order, his, business, was, severely, affected, by, the, beginning, of, the, great, depression, that, began, in, 1929, he, had, fewer, wealthy, clients, who, wanted, to, experiment, between, 1928, and, 1935, he, built, only, two, buildings, a, hotel, near, chandler, arizona, and, the, most, famous, of, all, his, residences, fallingwater, 1934, 37, a, vacation, house, in, pennsylvania, for, edgar, j, kaufman, fallingwater, is, a, remarkable, structure, of, concrete, slabs, suspended, over, a, waterfall, perfectly, uniting, architecture, and, nature, the, austrian, architect, rudolph, schindler, designed, what, could, be, called, the, first, house, in, the, modern, style, in, 1922, the, schindler, house, schindler, also, contributed, to, american, modernism, with, his, design, for, the, lovell, beach, house, in, newport, beach, the, austrian, architect, richard, neutra, moved, to, the, united, states, in, 1923, worked, for, a, short, time, with, frank, lloyd, wright, also, quickly, became, a, force, in, american, architecture, through, his, modernist, design, for, the, same, client, the, lovell, health, house, in, los, angeles, neutra, s, most, notable, architectural, work, was, the, kaufmann, desert, house, in, 1946, and, he, designed, hundreds, of, further, projects, the, 1937, paris, international, exposition, in, paris, effectively, marked, the, end, of, the, art, deco, and, of, pre, war, architectural, styles, most, of, the, pavilions, were, in, a, neoclassical, deco, style, with, colonnades, and, sculptural, decoration, the, pavilions, of, nazi, germany, designed, by, albert, speer, in, a, german, neoclassical, style, topped, by, eagle, and, swastika, faced, the, pavilion, of, the, soviet, union, topped, by, enormous, statues, of, a, worker, and, a, peasant, carrying, a, hammer, and, sickle, as, to, the, modernists, le, corbusier, was, practically, but, not, quite, invisible, at, the, exposition, he, participated, in, the, pavilion, des, temps, nouveaux, but, focused, mainly, on, his, painting, the, one, modernist, who, did, attract, attention, was, a, collaborator, of, le, corbusier, josep, lluis, sert, the, spanish, architect, whose, pavilion, of, the, second, spanish, republic, was, pure, modernist, glass, and, steel, box, inside, it, displayed, the, most, modernist, work, of, the, exposition, the, painting, guernica, by, pablo, picasso, the, original, building, was, destroyed, after, the, exposition, but, it, was, recreated, in, 1992, in, barcelona, the, rise, of, nationalism, in, the, 1930s, was, reflected, in, the, fascist, architecture, of, italy, and, nazi, architecture, of, germany, based, on, classical, styles, and, designed, to, express, power, and, grandeur, the, nazi, architecture, much, of, it, designed, by, albert, speer, was, intended, to, awe, the, spectators, by, its, huge, scale, adolf, hitler, intended, to, turn, berlin, into, the, capital, of, europe, grander, than, rome, or, paris, the, nazis, closed, the, bauhaus, and, the, most, prominent, modern, architects, soon, departed, for, britain, or, the, united, states, in, italy, benito, mussolini, wished, to, present, himself, as, the, heir, to, the, glory, and, empire, of, ancient, rome, mussolini, s, government, was, not, as, hostile, to, modernism, as, the, nazis, the, spirit, of, italian, rationalism, of, the, 1920s, continued, with, the, work, of, architect, giuseppe, terragni, his, casa, del, fascio, in, como, headquarters, of, the, local, fascist, party, was, a, perfectly, modernist, building, with, geometric, proportions, 33, 2, meters, long, by, 16, 6, meters, high, a, clean, fa, ade, of, marble, and, a, renaissance, inspired, interior, courtyard, opposed, to, terragni, was, marcello, piacitini, a, proponent, of, monumental, fascist, architecture, who, rebuilt, the, university, of, rome, and, designed, the, italian, pavilion, at, the, 1937, paris, exposition, and, planned, a, grand, reconstruction, of, rome, on, the, fascist, model, the, 1939, new, york, world, s, fair, marked, a, turning, point, in, architecture, between, art, deco, and, modern, architecture, the, theme, of, the, fair, was, the, world, of, tomorrow, and, its, symbols, were, the, purely, geometric, trylon, and, periphery, sculpture, it, had, many, monuments, to, art, deco, such, as, the, ford, pavilion, in, the, streamline, moderne, style, but, also, included, the, new, international, style, that, would, replace, art, deco, as, the, dominant, style, after, the, war, the, pavilions, of, finland, by, alvar, aalto, of, sweden, by, sven, markelius, and, of, brazil, by, oscar, niemeyer, and, l, cio, costa, looked, forward, to, a, new, style, they, became, leaders, in, the, postwar, modernist, movement, world, war, ii, 1939, 1945, and, its, aftermath, was, a, major, factor, in, driving, innovation, in, building, technology, and, in, turn, architectural, possibilities, the, wartime, industrial, demands, resulted, in, shortages, of, steel, and, other, building, materials, leading, to, the, adoption, of, new, materials, such, as, aluminum, the, war, and, postwar, period, brought, greatly, expanded, use, of, prefabricated, building, largely, for, the, military, and, government, the, semi, circular, metal, nissen, hut, of, world, war, i, was, revived, as, the, quonset, hut, the, years, immediately, after, the, war, saw, the, development, of, radical, experimental, houses, including, the, enameled, steel, lustron, house, 1947, 1950, and, buckminster, fuller, s, experimental, aluminum, dymaxion, house, the, unprecedented, destruction, caused, by, the, war, was, another, factor, in, the, rise, of, modern, architecture, large, parts, of, major, cities, from, berlin, tokyo, and, dresden, to, rotterdam, and, east, london, all, the, port, cities, of, france, particularly, le, havre, brest, marseille, cherbourg, had, been, destroyed, by, bombing, in, the, united, states, little, civilian, construction, had, been, done, since, the, 1920s, housing, was, needed, for, millions, of, american, soldiers, returning, from, the, war, the, postwar, housing, shortages, in, europe, and, the, united, states, led, to, the, design, and, construction, of, enormous, government, financed, housing, projects, usually, in, run, down, center, of, american, cities, and, in, the, suburbs, of, paris, and, other, european, cities, where, land, was, available, one, of, the, largest, reconstruction, projects, was, that, of, the, city, center, of, le, havre, destroyed, by, the, germans, and, by, allied, bombing, in, 1944, 133, hectares, of, buildings, in, the, center, were, flattened, destroying, 12, 500, buildings, and, leaving, 40, 000, persons, homeless, the, architect, auguste, perret, a, pioneer, in, the, use, of, reinforced, concrete, and, prefabricated, materials, designed, and, built, an, entirely, new, center, to, the, city, with, apartment, blocks, cultural, commercial, and, government, buildings, he, restored, historic, monuments, when, possible, and, built, a, new, church, st, joseph, with, a, lighthouse, like, tower, in, the, center, to, inspire, hope, his, rebuilt, city, was, declared, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, in, 2005, shortly, after, the, war, the, french, architect, le, corbusier, who, was, nearly, sixty, years, old, and, had, not, constructed, a, building, in, ten, years, was, commissioned, by, the, french, government, to, construct, a, new, apartment, block, in, marseille, he, called, it, unit, d, habitation, in, marseille, but, it, more, popularly, took, the, name, of, the, cit, radieuse, and, later, cit, du, fada, city, of, the, crazy, one, in, marseille, french, after, his, book, about, futuristic, urban, planning, following, his, doctrines, of, design, the, building, had, a, concrete, frame, raised, up, above, the, street, on, pylons, it, contained, 337, duplex, apartment, units, fit, into, the, framework, like, pieces, of, a, puzzle, each, unit, had, two, levels, and, a, small, terrace, interior, streets, had, shops, a, nursery, school, and, other, serves, and, the, flat, terrace, roof, had, a, running, track, ventilation, ducts, and, a, small, theater, le, corbusier, designed, furniture, carpets, and, lamps, to, go, with, the, building, all, purely, functional, the, only, decoration, was, a, choice, of, interior, colors, that, le, corbusier, gave, to, residents, unit, d, habitation, became, a, prototype, for, similar, buildings, in, other, cities, both, in, france, and, germany, combined, with, his, equally, radical, organic, design, for, the, chapel, of, notre, dame, du, haut, at, ronchamp, this, work, propelled, corbusier, in, the, first, rank, of, postwar, modern, architects, in, the, early, 1950s, michel, cochard, director, of, urban, planning, under, the, french, protectorate, in, morocco, commissioned, gamma, groupe, des, architectes, modernes, marocains, which, initially, included, the, architects, elie, azagury, george, candillis, alexis, josic, and, shadrach, woods, to, design, housing, in, the, hay, mohammedi, neighborhood, of, casablanca, that, provided, a, culturally, specific, living, tissue, for, laborers, and, migrants, from, the, countryside, s, miramis, nid, d, abeille, honeycomb, and, carri, res, centrales, were, some, of, the, first, examples, of, this, vernacular, modernism, at, the, 1953, congr, s, internationaux, d, architecture, moderne, ciam, atbat, afrique, the, africa, branch, of, atelier, des, b, tisseurs, founded, in, 1947, by, figures, including, le, corbusier, vladimir, bodiansky, and, andr, wogenscky, prepared, a, study, of, casablanca, s, bidonvilles, entitled, habitat, for, the, greatest, number, the, presenters, georges, candilis, and, michel, ecochard, argued, against, doctrine, that, architects, must, consider, local, culture, and, climate, in, their, designs, this, generated, great, debate, among, modernist, architects, around, the, world, and, eventually, provoked, a, schism, and, the, creation, of, team, 10, ecochard, s, 8x8, meter, model, at, carri, res, centrales, earned, him, recognition, as, a, pioneer, in, the, architecture, of, collective, housing, though, his, moroccan, colleague, elie, azagury, was, critical, of, him, for, serving, as, a, tool, of, the, french, colonial, regime, and, for, ignoring, the, economic, and, social, necessity, that, moroccans, live, in, higher, density, vertical, housing, late, modernist, architecture, is, generally, understood, to, include, buildings, designed, 1968, 1980, with, exceptions, modernist, architecture, includes, the, buildings, designed, between, 1945, and, the, 1960s, the, late, modernist, style, is, characterized, by, bold, shapes, and, sharp, corners, slightly, more, defined, than, brutalist, architecture, the, international, style, of, architecture, had, appeared, in, europe, particularly, in, the, bauhaus, movement, in, the, late, 1920s, in, 1932, it, was, recognized, and, given, a, name, at, an, exhibition, at, the, museum, of, modern, art, in, new, york, city, organized, by, architect, philip, johnson, and, architectural, critic, henry, russell, hitchcock, between, 1937, and, 1941, following, the, rise, hitler, and, the, nazis, in, germany, most, of, the, leaders, of, the, german, bauhaus, movement, found, a, new, home, in, the, united, states, and, played, an, important, part, in, the, development, of, american, modern, architecture, frank, lloyd, wright, was, eighty, years, old, in, 1947, he, had, been, present, at, the, beginning, of, american, modernism, and, though, he, refused, to, accept, that, he, belonged, to, any, movement, continued, to, play, a, leading, role, almost, to, its, end, one, of, his, most, original, late, projects, was, the, campus, of, florida, southern, college, in, lakeland, florida, begun, in, 1941, and, completed, in, 1943, he, designed, nine, new, buildings, in, a, style, that, he, described, as, the, child, of, the, sun, he, wrote, that, he, wanted, the, campus, to, grow, out, of, the, ground, and, into, the, light, a, child, of, the, sun, he, completed, several, notable, projects, in, the, 1940s, including, the, johnson, wax, headquarters, and, the, price, tower, in, bartlesville, oklahoma, 1956, the, building, is, unusual, that, it, is, supported, by, its, central, core, of, four, elevator, shafts, the, rest, of, the, building, is, cantilevered, to, this, core, like, the, branches, of, a, tree, wright, originally, planned, the, structure, for, an, apartment, building, in, new, york, city, that, project, was, cancelled, because, of, the, great, depression, and, he, adapted, the, design, for, an, oil, pipeline, and, equipment, company, in, oklahoma, he, wrote, that, in, new, york, city, his, building, would, have, been, lost, in, a, forest, of, tall, buildings, but, that, in, oklahoma, it, stood, alone, the, design, is, asymmetrical, each, side, is, different, in, 1943, he, was, commissioned, by, the, art, collector, solomon, r, guggenheim, to, design, a, museum, for, his, collection, of, modern, art, his, design, was, entirely, original, a, bowl, shaped, building, with, a, spiral, ramp, inside, that, led, museum, visitors, on, an, upward, tour, of, the, art, of, the, 20th, century, work, began, in, 1946, but, it, was, not, completed, until, 1959, the, year, that, he, died, walter, gropius, the, founder, of, the, bauhaus, moved, to, england, in, 1934, and, spent, three, years, there, before, being, invited, to, the, united, states, by, walter, hudnut, of, the, harvard, graduate, school, of, design, gropius, became, the, head, of, the, architecture, faculty, marcel, breuer, who, had, worked, with, him, at, the, bauhaus, joined, him, and, opened, an, office, in, cambridge, the, fame, of, gropius, and, breuer, attracted, many, students, who, themselves, became, famous, architects, including, ieoh, ming, pei, and, philip, johnson, they, did, not, receive, an, important, commission, until, 1941, when, they, designed, housing, for, workers, in, kensington, pennsylvania, near, pittsburgh, in, 1945, gropius, and, breuer, associated, with, a, group, of, younger, architects, under, the, name, tac, the, architects,

structure, the, roof, is, connected, with, the, ground, by, curtain, walls, of, glass, all, of, the, details, inside, the, building, including, the, benches, counters, escalators, and, clocks, were,

winds, the, doors, could, not, be, opened, pei, was, forced, to, construct, a, tunnel, so, visitors, could, enter, the, building, during, high, winds, between, 1963, and, 1967, pei, designed, the, mesa, laboratory, for, the, national, center, for, atmospheric, research, outside, boulder, colorado, in, an, open, area, at, the, foothills, of, the, rocky, mountains, the, project, differed, from, pei, s, earlier, urban, work, it, would, rest, in, an, open, area, in, the, foothills, of, the, rocky, mountains, his, design, was, a, striking, departure, from, traditional, modernism, it, looked, as, if, it, were, carved, out, of, the, side, of, the, mountain, in, the, late, modernist, area, art, museums, bypassed, skyscrapers, as, the, most, prestigious, architectural, projects, they, offered, greater, possibilities, for, innovation, in, form, and, more, visibility, pei, established, himself, with, his, design, for, the, herbert, f, johnson, museum, of, art, at, cornell, university, in, ithaca, new, york, 1973, which, was, praised, for, its, imaginative, use, of, a, small, space, and, its, respect, for, the, landscape, and, other, buildings, around, it, this, led, to, the, commission, for, one, of, the, most, important, museum, projects, of, the, period, the, new, east, wing, of, the, national, gallery, of, art, in, washington, completed, in, 1978, and, to, another, of, pei, s, most, famous, projects, the, pyramid, at, the, entrance, of, louvre, museum, in, paris, 1983, 89, pei, chose, the, pyramid, as, the, form, that, best, harmonized, with, the, renaissance, and, neoclassical, forms, of, the, historic, louvre, as, well, as, for, its, associations, with, napoleon, and, the, battle, of, the, pyramids, each, face, of, the, pyramid, is, supported, by, 128, beams, of, stainless, steel, supporting, 675, panels, of, glass, each, 2, 9, by, 1, 9, meters, 9, ft, 6, in, by, 6, ft, 3, in, in, 1955, employed, by, the, architectural, firm, skidmore, owings, merrill, som, he, began, working, in, chicago, he, was, made, a, partner, in, 1966, he, worked, the, rest, of, his, life, side, by, side, with, architect, bruce, graham, khan, introduced, design, methods, and, concepts, for, efficient, use, of, material, in, building, architecture, his, first, building, to, employ, the, tube, structure, was, the, chestnut, de, witt, apartment, building, during, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, he, became, noted, for, his, designs, for, chicago, s, 100, story, john, hancock, center, which, was, the, first, building, to, use, the, trussed, tube, design, and, 110, story, sears, tower, since, renamed, willis, tower, the, tallest, building, in, the, world, from, 1973, until, 1998, which, was, the, first, building, to, use, the, framed, tube, design, he, believed, that, engineers, needed, a, broader, perspective, on, life, saying, the, technical, man, must, not, be, lost, in, his, own, technology, he, must, be, able, to, appreciate, life, and, life, is, art, drama, music, and, most, importantly, people, khan, s, personal, papers, most, of, which, were, in, his, office, at, the, time, of, his, death, are, held, by, the, ryerson, burnham, libraries, at, the, art, institute, of, chicago, the, fazlur, khan, collection, includes, manuscripts, sketches, audio, cassette, tapes, slides, and, other, materials, regarding, his, work, khan, s, seminal, work, of, developing, tall, building, structural, systems, are, still, used, today, as, the, starting, point, when, considering, design, options, for, tall, buildings, tube, structures, have, since, been, used, in, many, skyscrapers, including, the, construction, of, the, world, trade, center, aon, centre, petronas, towers, jin, mao, building, bank, of, china, tower, and, most, other, buildings, in, excess, of, 40, stories, constructed, since, the, 1960s, the, strong, influence, of, tube, structure, design, is, also, evident, in, the, world, s, current, tallest, skyscraper, the, burj, khalifa, in, dubai, according, to, stephen, bayley, of, the, daily, telegraph, khan, invented, a, new, way, of, building, tall, so, fazlur, khan, created, the, unconventional, skyscraper, reversing, the, logic, of, the, steel, frame, he, decided, that, the, building, s, external, envelope, could, given, enough, trussing, framing, and, bracing, be, the, structure, itself, this, made, buildings, even, lighter, the, bundled, tube, meant, buildings, no, longer, need, be, boxlike, in, appearance, they, could, become, sculpture, khan, s, amazing, insight, he, was, name, checked, by, obama, in, his, cairo, university, speech, last, year, changed, both, the, economics, and, the, morphology, of, supertall, buildings, and, it, made, burj, khalifa, possible, proportionately, burj, employs, perhaps, half, the, steel, that, conservatively, supports, the, empire, state, building, burj, khalifa, is, the, ultimate, expression, of, his, audacious, lightweight, design, philosophy, in, the, united, states, minoru, yamasaki, found, major, independent, success, in, implementing, unique, engineering, solutions, to, then, complicated, problems, including, the, space, that, elevator, shafts, took, up, on, each, floor, and, dealing, with, his, personal, fear, of, heights, during, this, period, he, created, a, number, of, office, buildings, which, led, to, his, innovative, design, of, the, 1, 360, ft, 410, m, towers, of, the, world, trade, center, in, 1964, which, began, construction, 21, march, 1966, the, first, of, the, towers, was, finished, in, 1970, many, of, his, buildings, feature, superficial, details, inspired, by, the, pointed, arches, of, gothic, architecture, and, make, use, of, extremely, narrow, vertical, windows, this, narrow, windowed, style, arose, from, his, own, personal, fear, of, heights, one, particular, design, challenge, of, the, world, trade, center, s, design, related, to, the, efficacy, of, the, elevator, system, which, was, unique, in, the, world, yamasaki, integrated, the, fastest, elevators, at, the, time, running, at, 1, 700, feet, per, minute, instead, of, placing, a, large, traditional, elevator, shaft, in, the, core, of, each, tower, yamasaki, created, the, twin, towers, skylobby, system, the, skylobby, design, created, three, separate, connected, elevator, systems, which, would, serve, different, segments, of, the, building, depending, on, which, floor, was, chosen, saving, approximately, 70, of, the, space, used, for, a, traditional, shaft, the, space, saved, was, then, used, for, office, space, in, addition, to, these, accomplishments, he, had, also, designed, the, pruitt, igoe, housing, project, the, largest, ever, housing, project, built, in, the, united, states, which, was, fully, torn, down, in, 1976, due, to, bad, market, conditions, and, the, decrepit, state, of, the, buildings, themselves, separately, he, had, also, designed, the, century, plaza, towers, and, one, woodward, avenue, among, 63, other, projects, he, had, developed, during, his, career, in, france, le, corbusier, remained, the, most, prominent, architect, though, he, built, few, buildings, there,
