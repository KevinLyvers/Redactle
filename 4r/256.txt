the, gutenberg, bible, also, known, as, the, 42, line, bible, the, mazarin, bible, or, the, b42, was, the, earliest, major, book, printed, in, europe, using, mass, produced, metal, movable, type, it, marked, the, start, of, the, gutenberg, revolution, and, the, age, of, printed, books, in, the, west, the, book, is, valued, and, revered, for, its, high, aesthetic, and, artistic, qualities, and, its, historical, significance, the, gutenberg, bible, is, an, edition, of, the, latin, vulgate, printed, in, the, 1450s, by, johannes, gutenberg, in, mainz, in, present, day, germany, forty, nine, copies, or, substantial, portions, of, copies, have, survived, they, are, thought, to, be, among, the, world, s, most, valuable, books, although, no, complete, copy, has, been, sold, since, 1978, in, march, 1455, the, future, pope, pius, ii, wrote, that, he, had, seen, pages, from, the, gutenberg, bible, displayed, in, frankfurt, to, promote, the, edition, and, that, either, 158, or, 180, copies, had, been, printed, the, 36, line, bible, said, to, be, the, second, printed, bible, is, also, sometimes, referred, to, as, a, gutenberg, bible, but, may, be, the, work, of, another, printer, the, gutenberg, bible, an, edition, of, the, vulgate, contains, the, latin, version, of, the, hebrew, old, testament, and, the, greek, new, testament, it, is, mainly, the, work, of, st, jerome, who, began, his, work, on, the, translation, in, ad, 380, with, emendations, from, the, parisian, bible, tradition, and, further, divergences, while, it, is, unlikely, that, any, of, gutenberg, s, early, publications, would, bear, his, name, the, initial, expense, of, press, equipment, and, materials, and, of, the, work, to, be, done, before, the, bible, was, ready, for, sale, suggests, that, he, may, have, started, with, more, lucrative, texts, including, several, religious, documents, a, german, poem, and, some, editions, of, aelius, donatus, s, ars, minor, a, popular, latin, grammar, school, book, preparation, of, the, bible, probably, began, soon, after, 1450, and, the, first, finished, copies, were, available, in, 1454, or, 1455, it, is, not, known, exactly, how, long, the, bible, took, to, print, the, first, precisely, datable, printing, is, gutenberg, s, 31, line, indulgence, which, certainly, existed, by, 22, october, 1454, gutenberg, made, three, significant, changes, during, the, printing, process, some, time, later, after, more, sheets, had, been, printed, the, number, of, lines, per, page, was, increased, from, 40, to, 42, presumably, to, save, paper, therefore, pages, 1, to, 9, and, pages, 256, to, 265, presumably, the, first, ones, printed, have, 40, lines, each, page, 10, has, 41, and, from, there, on, the, 42, lines, appear, the, increase, in, line, number, was, achieved, by, decreasing, the, interline, spacing, rather, than, increasing, the, printed, area, of, the, page, finally, the, print, run, was, increased, necessitating, resetting, those, pages, which, had, already, been, printed, the, new, sheets, were, all, reset, to, 42, lines, per, page, consequently, there, are, two, distinct, settings, in, folios, 1, 32, and, 129, 158, of, volume, i, and, folios, 1, 16, and, 162, of, volume, ii, the, most, reliable, information, about, the, bible, s, date, comes, from, a, letter, in, march, 1455, the, future, pope, pius, ii, wrote, that, he, had, seen, pages, from, the, gutenberg, bible, being, displayed, to, promote, the, edition, in, frankfurt, it, is, not, known, how, many, copies, were, printed, with, the, 1455, letter, citing, sources, for, both, 158, and, 180, copies, scholars, today, think, that, examination, of, surviving, copies, suggests, that, somewhere, between, 160, and, 185, copies, were, printed, with, about, three, quarters, on, paper, and, the, others, on, vellum, in, a, legal, paper, written, after, completion, of, the, bible, johannes, gutenberg, refers, to, the, process, as, das, werk, der, b, cher, the, work, of, the, books, he, had, introduced, the, printing, press, to, europe, and, created, the, technology, to, make, printing, with, movable, types, finally, efficient, enough, to, facilitate, the, mass, production, of, entire, books, many, book, lovers, have, commented, on, the, high, standards, achieved, in, the, production, of, the, gutenberg, bible, some, describing, it, as, one, of, the, most, beautiful, books, ever, printed, the, quality, of, both, the, ink, and, other, materials, and, the, printing, itself, have, been, noted, the, paper, size, is, double, folio, with, two, pages, printed, on, each, side, four, pages, per, sheet, after, printing, the, paper, was, folded, once, to, the, size, of, a, single, page, typically, five, of, these, folded, sheets, ten, leaves, or, twenty, printed, pages, were, combined, to, a, single, physical, section, called, a, quinternion, that, could, then, be, bound, into, a, book, some, sections, however, had, as, few, as, four, leaves, or, as, many, as, twelve, leaves, the, 42, line, bible, was, printed, on, the, size, of, paper, known, as, royal, a, full, sheet, of, royal, paper, measures, 42, cm, 60, cm, 17, in, 24, in, and, a, single, untrimmed, folio, leaf, measures, 42, cm, 30, cm, 17, in, 12, in, there, have, been, attempts, to, claim, that, the, book, was, printed, on, larger, paper, measuring, 44, 5, cm, 30, 7, cm, 17, 5, in, 12, 1, in, but, this, assertion, is, contradicted, by, the, dimensions, of, existing, copies, for, example, the, leaves, of, the, copy, in, the, bodleian, library, oxford, measure, 40, cm, 28, 6, cm, 15, 7, in, 11, 3, in, this, is, typical, of, other, folio, bibles, printed, on, royal, paper, in, the, fifteenth, century, most, fifteenth, century, printing, papers, have, a, width, to, height, ratio, of, 1, 1, 4, e, g, 30, 42, cm, which, mathematically, is, a, ratio, of, 1, to, the, square, root, of, 2, or, simply, 2, textstyle, sqrt, 2, many, suggest, that, this, ratio, was, chosen, to, match, the, so, called, golden, ratio, 1, 5, 2, textstyle, tfrac, 1, sqrt, 5, 2, of, 1, 1, 6, in, fact, the, ratios, are, plainly, not, at, all, similar, equating, to, a, difference, of, about, 12, per, cent, the, ratio, of, 1, 1, 4, was, a, long, established, one, for, medieval, paper, sizes, a, single, complete, copy, of, the, gutenberg, bible, has, 1, 288, pages, 4, 322, 1288, usually, bound, in, two, volumes, with, four, pages, per, folio, sheet, 322, sheets, of, paper, are, required, per, copy, the, bible, s, paper, consists, of, linen, fibers, and, is, thought, to, have, been, imported, from, caselle, in, piedmont, italy, based, on, the, watermarks, present, throughout, the, volume, in, gutenberg, s, time, inks, used, by, scribes, to, produce, manuscripts, were, water, based, gutenberg, developed, an, oil, based, ink, that, would, better, adhere, to, his, metal, type, his, ink, was, primarily, carbon, but, also, had, a, high, metallic, content, with, copper, lead, and, titanium, predominating, head, of, collections, at, the, british, library, kristian, jensen, described, it, thus, if, you, look, closely, you, will, see, this, is, a, very, shiny, surface, when, you, write, you, use, a, water, based, ink, you, put, your, pen, into, it, and, it, runs, off, now, if, you, print, that, s, exactly, what, you, don, t, want, one, of, gutenberg, s, inventions, was, an, ink, which, wasn, t, ink, it, s, a, varnish, so, what, we, call, printer, s, ink, is, actually, a, varnish, and, that, means, it, sticks, to, its, surface, each, unique, character, requires, a, piece, of, master, type, in, order, to, be, replicated, given, that, each, letter, has, uppercase, and, lowercase, forms, and, the, number, of, various, punctuation, marks, and, ligatures, e, g, for, the, letter, sequence, fi, commonly, used, in, writing, the, gutenberg, bible, needed, a, set, of, 290, master, characters, it, seems, probable, that, six, pages, containing, 15, 600, characters, altogether, would, be, set, at, any, one, moment, the, gutenberg, bible, is, printed, in, the, blackletter, type, styles, that, would, become, known, as, textualis, textura, and, schwabacher, the, name, textura, refers, to, the, texture, of, the, printed, page, straight, vertical, strokes, combined, with, horizontal, lines, giving, the, impression, of, a, woven, structure, gutenberg, already, used, the, technique, of, justification, that, is, creating, a, vertical, not, indented, alignment, at, the, left, and, right, hand, sides, of, the, column, to, do, this, he, used, various, methods, including, using, characters, of, narrower, widths, adding, extra, spaces, around, punctuation, and, varying, the, widths, of, spaces, around, words, initially, the, rubrics, the, headings, before, each, book, of, the, bible, were, printed, but, this, practice, was, quickly, abandoned, at, an, unknown, date, and, gaps, were, left, for, rubrication, to, be, added, by, hand, a, guide, of, the, text, to, be, added, to, each, page, printed, for, use, by, rubricators, survives, the, spacious, margin, allowed, illuminated, decoration, to, be, added, by, hand, the, amount, of, decoration, presumably, depended, on, how, much, each, buyer, could, or, would, pay, some, copies, were, never, decorated, the, place, of, decoration, can, be, known, or, inferred, for, about, 30, of, the, surviving, copies, it, is, possible, that, 13, of, these, copies, received, their, decoration, in, mainz, but, others, were, worked, on, as, far, away, as, london, the, vellum, bibles, were, more, expensive, and, perhaps, for, this, reason, tend, to, be, more, highly, decorated, although, the, vellum, copy, in, the, british, library, is, completely, undecorated, there, has, been, speculation, that, the, master, of, the, playing, cards, an, unidentified, engraver, who, has, been, called, the, first, personality, in, the, history, of, engraving, was, partly, responsible, for, the, illumination, of, the, copy, held, by, the, princeton, university, library, however, all, that, can, be, said, for, certain, is, that, the, same, model, book, was, used, for, some, of, the, illustrations, in, this, copy, and, for, some, of, the, master, s, illustrated, playing, cards, although, many, gutenberg, bibles, have, been, rebound, over, the, years, nine, copies, retain, fifteenth, century, bindings, most, of, these, copies, were, bound, in, either, mainz, or, erfurt, most, copies, were, divided, into, two, volumes, the, first, volume, ending, with, the, book, of, psalms, copies, on, vellum, were, heavier, and, for, this, reason, were, sometimes, bound, in, three, or, four, volumes, the, bible, seems, to, have, sold, out, immediately, with, some, initial, purchases, as, far, away, as, england, and, possibly, sweden, and, hungary, at, least, some, copies, are, known, to, have, sold, for, 30, florins, equivalent, to, about, 100, grams, or, 3, 5, ounces, of, gold, which, was, about, three, years, wages, for, a, clerk, although, this, made, them, significantly, cheaper, than, manuscript, bibles, most, students, priests, or, other, people, of, moderate, income, would, not, have, been, able, to, afford, them, it, is, assumed, that, most, were, sold, to, monasteries, universities, and, particularly, wealthy, individuals, at, present, only, one, copy, is, known, to, have, been, privately, owned, in, the, fifteenth, century, some, are, known, to, have, been, used, for, communal, readings, in, monastery, refectories, others, may, have, been, for, display, rather, than, use, and, a, few, were, certainly, used, for, study, kristian, jensen, suggests, that, many, copies, were, bought, by, wealthy, and, pious, laymen, for, donation, to, religious, institutions, the, gutenberg, bible, had, a, profound, effect, on, the, history, of, the, printed, book, textually, it, also, had, an, influence, on, future, editions, of, the, bible, it, provided, the, model, for, several, later, editions, including, the, 36, line, bible, mentelin, s, latin, bible, and, the, first, and, third, eggestein, bibles, the, third, eggestein, bible, was, set, from, the, copy, of, the, gutenberg, bible, now, in, cambridge, university, library, the, gutenberg, bible, also, had, an, influence, on, the, clementine, edition, of, the, vulgate, commissioned, by, the, papacy, in, the, late, sixteenth, century, joseph, martini, a, new, york, book, dealer, found, that, the, gutenberg, bible, held, by, the, library, of, the, general, theological, seminary, in, new, york, had, a, forged, leaf, carrying, part, of, chapter, 14, all, of, chapter, 15, and, part, of, chapter, 16, of, the, book, of, ezekiel, it, was, impossible, to, tell, when, the, leaf, had, been, inserted, into, the, volume, it, was, replaced, in, the, fall, of, 1953, when, a, patron, donated, the, corresponding, leaf, from, a, defective, gutenberg, second, volume, which, was, being, broken, up, and, sold, in, parts, this, made, it, the, first, imperfect, gutenberg, bible, ever, restored, to, completeness, in, 1978, this, copy, was, sold, for, us, 2, 2, million, to, the, w, rttembergische, landesbibliothek, in, stuttgart, germany, as, of, 2009, 49, gutenberg, bibles, are, known, to, exist, but, of, these, only, 21, are, complete, others, have, pages, or, even, whole, volumes, missing, in, addition, there, are, a, substantial, number, of, fragments, some, as, small, as, individual, leaves, which, are, likely, to, represent, about, another, 16, copies, many, of, these, fragments, have, survived, because, they, were, used, as, part, of, the, binding, of, later, books, today, few, copies, remain, in, religious, institutions, with, most, now, owned, by, university, libraries, and, other, major, scholarly, institutions, after, centuries, in, which, all, copies, seem, to, have, remained, in, europe, the, first, gutenberg, bible, reached, north, america, in, 1847, it, is, now, in, the, new, york, public, library, in, the, last, hundred, years, several, long, lost, copies, have, come, to, light, considerably, improving, the, understanding, of, how, the, bible, was, produced, and, distributed, in, 1921, a, new, york, rare, book, dealer, gabriel, wells, bought, a, damaged, paper, copy, dismantled, the, book, and, sold, sections, and, individual, leaves, to, book, collectors, and, libraries, the, leaves, were, sold, in, a, portfolio, case, with, an, essay, written, by, a, edward, newton, and, were, referred, to, as, noble, fragments, in, 1953, charles, scribner, s, sons, also, book, dealers, in, new, york, dismembered, a, damaged, paper, copy, of, volume, ii, the, largest, portion, of, this, the, new, testament, is,
