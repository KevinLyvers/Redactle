emerged, in, its, modern, form, in, the, 1950s, with, the, popularity, of, rock, and, roll, it, was, also, greatly, influenced, by, the, sounds, of, electric, blues, guitarists, the, sound, of, an, electric, guitar, in, rock, music, is, typically, supported, by, an, electric, bass, guitar, which, pioneered, jazz, music, in, the, same, era, and, by, percussion, produced, from, a, drum, kit, that, combines, drums, and, cymbals, this, trio, of, instruments, has, often, been, complemented, by, the, inclusion, of, other, instruments, particularly, keyboards, such, as, the, piano, the, hammond,

stylistic, diversity, of, rock, because, of, its, complex, history, and, its, tendency, to, borrow, from, other, musical, and, cultural, forms, it, has, been, argued, that, it, is, impossible, to, bind, rock, music, to, a, rigidly, delineated, musical, definition, in, the, opinion, of, music, journalist, robert, christgau, the, best, rock, jolts, folk, art, virtues, directness, utility, natural, audience, into, the, present, with, shots, of, modern, technology, and, modernist, dissociation, rock, and, roll, was, conceived, as, an, outlet, for, adolescent, yearnings, to, make, rock, and, roll, is, also, an, ideal, way, to, explore, intersections, of, sex, love, violence, and, fun, to, broadcast, the, delights, and, limitations, of, the, regional, and, to, deal, with, the, depredations, and, benefits, of, mass, culture, itself, robert, christgau, in, christgau, s, record, guide, 1981, unlike, many, earlier, styles, of, popular, music, rock, lyrics, have, dealt, with, a, wide, range, of, themes, including, romantic, love, sex, rebellion, against, the, establishment, social, concerns, and, life, styles, these, themes, were, inherited, from, a, variety, of, sources, such, as, the, tin, pan, alley, pop, tradition, folk, music, and, rhythm, and, blues, christgau, characterizes, rock, lyrics, as, a, cool, medium, with, simple, diction, and, repeated, refrains, and, asserts, that, rock, s, primary, function, pertains, to, music, or, more, generally, noise, the, predominance, of, white, male, and, often, middle, class, musicians, in, rock, music, has, often, been, noted, and, rock, has, been, seen, as, an, appropriation, of, black, musical, forms, for, a, young, white, and, largely, male, audience, as, a, result, it, has, also, been, seen, to, articulate, the, concerns, of, this, group, in, both, style, and, lyrics, christgau, writing, in, 1972, said, in, spite, of, some, exceptions, rock, and, roll, usually, implies, an, identification, of, male, sexuality, and, aggression, since, the, term, rock, started, being, used, in, preference, to, rock, and, roll, from, the, late, 1960s, it, has, usually, been, contrasted, with, pop, music, with, which, it, has, shared, many, characteristics, but, from, which, it, is, often, distanced, by, an, emphasis, on, musicianship, live, performance, and, a, focus, on, serious, and, progressive, themes, as, part, of, an, ideology, of, authenticity, that, is, frequently, combined, with, an, awareness, of, the, genre, s, history, and, development, according, to, simon, frith, rock, was, something, more, than, pop, something, more, than, rock, and, roll, and, ock, musicians, combined, an, emphasis, on, skill, and, technique, with, the, romantic, concept, of, art, as, artistic, expression, original, and, sincere, in, the, new, millennium, the, term, rock, has, occasionally, been, used, as, a, blanket, term, including, forms, like, pop, music, reggae, music, soul, music, and, even, hip, hop, which, it, has, been, influenced, with, but, often, contrasted, through, much, of, its, history, christgau, has, used, the, term, broadly, to, refer, to, popular, and, semipopular, music, that, caters, to, his, sensibility, as, a, rock, and, roller, including, a, fondness, for, a, good, beat, a, meaningful, lyric, with, some, wit, and, the, theme, of, youth, which, holds, an, eternal, attraction, so, objective, that, all, youth, music, partakes, of, sociology, and, the, field, report, writing, in, christgau, s, record, guide, the, 80s, 1990, he, said, this, sensibility, is, evident, in, the, music, of, folk, singer, songwriter, michelle, shocked, rapper, ll, cool, j, and, synth, pop, duo, pet, shop, boys, all, kids, working, out, their, identities, as, much, as, it, is, in, the, music, of, chuck, berry, the, ramones, and, the, replacements, the, foundations, of, rock, music, are, in, rock, and, roll, which, originated, in, the, united, states, during, the, late, 1940s, and, early, 1950s, and, quickly, spread, to, much, of, the, rest, of, the, world, its, immediate, origins, lay, in, a, melding, of, various, black, musical, genres, of, the, time, including, rhythm, and, blues, and, gospel, music, with, country, and, western, debate, surrounds, the, many, recordings, which, have, been, suggested, as, the, first, rock, and, roll, record, contenders,

rock, and, roll, has, been, seen, as, leading, to, a, number, of, distinct, subgenres, including, rockabilly, combining, rock, and, roll, with, hillbilly, country, music, which, was, usually, played, and, recorded, in, the, mid, 1950s, by, white, singers, such, as, carl, perkins, jerry, lee, lewis, buddy, holly, and, with, the, greatest, commercial, success, elvis, presley, hispanic, and, latino,

swing, guitarists, such, as, junior, barnard, and, eldon, shamblin, was, popularized, by, chuck, berry, in, the, mid, 1950s, the, use, of, power, chords, pioneered, by, francisco, t, rrega, and, heitor, villa, lobos, in, the, 19th, century, and, later, on, by, willie, johnson, and, pat, hare, in, the, early, 1950s, was, popularized, by, link, wray, in, the, late, 1950s, commentators, have, traditionally, perceived, a, decline, of, rock, and, roll, in, the, late, 1950s, and, early, 1960s, by, 1959, the, death, of, buddy, holly, the, big, bopper, and, ritchie, valens, in, a, plane, crash,

in, the, uk, visiting, with, successful, tours, lonnie, donegan, s, 1955, hit, rock, island, line, was, a, major, influence, and, helped, to, develop, the, trend, of, skiffle, music, groups, throughout, the, country, many, of, which, including, john, lennon, s, quarrymen, later, the, beatles, moved, on, to, play, rock, and, roll, while, former, rock, and, roll, market, in, the, us, was,

were, starting, to, play, with, an, intensity, and, drive, seldom, found, in, white, american, acts, this, influence, would, go, on, to, shape, the, future, of, rock, music, through, the, british, invasion, the, first, four, years, of, the, 1960s, has, traditionally, been, seen, as, an, era, of, hiatus, for, rock, and, roll, more, recently, some, authors, have, emphasised, important, innovations, and, trends, in, this, period, without, which, future, developments, would, not, have, been, possible, while, early, rock, and, roll, particularly, through, the, advent, of, rockabilly, saw, the, greatest, commercial, success, for, male, and, white, performers, in, this, era, the, genre, was, dominated, by, black, and, female, artists, rock, and, roll, had, not, disappeared, entirely, from, music, at, the, end, of, the, 1950s, and, some, of, its, energy, can, be, seen, in, the, various, dance, crazes, of, the, early, 1960s, started, by, chubby, checker, s, record, the, twist, 1960, some, music, historians, have, also, pointed, to, important, and, innovative, technical, developments, that, built, on, rock, and, roll, in, this, period, including, the, electronic, treatment, of, sound, by, such, innovators, as, joe, meek, and, the, elaborate, production, methods, of, the, wall, of, sound, pursued, by, phil, spector, the, instrumental, rock, and, roll, of, performers, such, as, duane, eddy, link, wray, and, the, ventures, was, further, developed, by, dick, dale, who, added, distinctive, wet, reverb, rapid, alternate, picking, and, middle, eastern, and, mexican, influences, he, produced, the, regional, hit, let, s, go, trippin, in, 1961, and, launched, the, surf, music, craze, following, up, with, songs, like, misirlou, 1962, like, dale, and, his, del, tones, most, early, surf, bands, were, formed, in, southern, california, including, the, bel, airs, the, challengers, and, eddie, the, showmen, the, chantays, scored, a, top, ten, national, hit,

and, helped, make, the, surf, music, craze, a, national, phenomenon, it, is, often, argued, that, the, surf, music, craze, and, the, careers, of, almost, all, surf, acts, was, effectively, ended, by, the, arrival, of, the, british, invasion, from, 1964, because, most, surf, music, hits, were, recorded, and, released, between, 1960, and, 1965, by, the, end, of, 1962, what, would, become, the, british, rock, scene, had, started, with, beat, groups, like, the, beatles, gerry, the, pacemakers, and, the, searchers, from, liverpool, and, freddie, and, the, dreamers, herman, s, hermits, and,

standard, american, tunes, and, playing, for, dancers, bands, like, the, animals, from, newcastle, and, them, from, belfast, and, particularly, those, from, london, like, the, rolling, stones, and, the, yardbirds, were, much, more, directly, influenced, by, rhythm, and, blues, and, later, blues, music, soon, these, groups, were, composing, their, own, material, combining, us, forms, of, music, and, infusing, it, with, a, high, energy, beat, beat, bands, tended, towards, bouncy, irresistible, melodies, while, early, british, blues, acts, tended, towards, less, sexually, innocent, more, aggressive, songs, often, adopting, an, anti, establishment, stance, there, was, however, particularly, in, the, early, stages, considerable, musical, crossover, between, the, two, tendencies, by, 1963, led, by, the, beatles, beat, groups, had, begun, to, achieve, national, success, in, britain, soon, to, be, followed, into, the, charts, by, the, more, rhythm, and, blues, focused, acts, i,

of, high, school, life, with, songs, about, lying, girls, and, unfair, social, circumstances, being, particularly, common, the, lyrics, and, delivery, tended, to, be, more, aggressive, than, was, common, at, the, time, often, with, growled, or, shouted, vocals, that, dissolved, into, incoherent, screaming, they, ranged, from, crude, one, chord, music, like, the, seeds, to, near, studio,

garage, bands, were, extant, in, the, united, states, and, canada, during, the, era, and, hundreds, produced, regional, hits, despite, scores, of, bands, being, signed, to, major, or, large, regional, labels, most, were, commercial, failures, it, is, generally, agreed, that, garage, rock, peaked, both, commercially, and, artistically, around, 1966, by, 1968, the, style, largely, disappeared, from, the, national, charts, and, at, the, local, level, as, amateur, musicians, faced, college, work, or, the, draft, new, styles, had, evolved, to, replace, garage, rock, although, the, first, impact, of, the, british, invasion, on, american, popular, music, was, through, beat, and, r, b, based, acts, the, impetus, was, soon, taken, up, by, a, second, wave, of, bands, that, drew, their, inspiration, more, directly, from, american, blues, including, the, rolling, stones, and, the, yardbirds, british, blues, musicians, of, the, late, 1950s, and, early, 1960s, had, been, inspired, by, the, acoustic, playing, of, figures, such, as, lead, belly, who, was, a, major, influence, on, the, skiffle, craze, and, robert, johnson, increasingly, they, adopted, a, loud, amplified, sound, often, centered, on, the, electric, guitar, based, on, the, chicago, blues, particularly, after, the, tour, of, britain, by, muddy, waters, in, 1958, which, prompted, cyril, davies, and, guitarist, alexis, korner, to, form, the, band, blues, incorporated, the, band, involved, and, inspired, many, of, the, figures, of, the, subsequent, british, blues, boom, including, members, of, the, rolling, stones, and, cream,

considered, one, of, the, seminal, british, blues, recordings, and, the, sound, of, which, was, much, emulated, in, both, britain, and, the, united, states, eric, clapton, went, on, to, form, supergroups, cream, blind, faith, and, derek, and, the, dominos, followed, by, an, extensive, solo, career, that, helped, bring, blues, rock, into, the, mainstream, green, along, with, the, bluesbreaker, s, rhythm, section, mick, fleetwood, and, john, mcvie, formed, peter, green, s, fleetwood, mac, who, enjoyed, some, of, the, greatest, commercial, success, in, the, genre, in, the, late, 1960s, jeff, beck, also, an, alumnus, of, the, yardbirds, moved, blues, rock, in, the, direction, of, heavy, rock, with, his, band, the, jeff, beck, group, the, last, yardbirds, guitarist, was, jimmy,

expansions, on, traditional, blues, songs, in, america, blues, rock, had, been, pioneered, in, the, early, 1960s, by, guitarist, lonnie, mack, but, the, genre, began, to, take, off, in, the, mid, 1960s, as, acts, developed, a, sound, similar, to, british, blues, musicians, key, acts, included, paul, butterfield, whose, band, acted, like, mayall, s, bluesbreakers, in, britain, as, a, starting, point, for, many, successful, musicians, canned, heat, the, early, jefferson, airplane, janis, joplin, johnny, winter, the, j, geils, band, and, jimi, hendrix, with, his, power, trios, the, jimi,

of, the, decade, blues, rock, bands, from, the, southern, states, like, the, allman, brothers, band, lynyrd, skynyrd, and, zz, top, incorporated, country, elements, into, their, style, to, produce, the, distinctive, genre, southern, rock, early, blues, rock, bands, often, emulated, jazz, playing, long, involved, improvisations, which, would, later, be, a, major, element, of, progressive, rock, from, about, 1967, bands, like, cream, and, the, jimi, hendrix, experience, had, moved, away, from, purely, blues, based, music, into, psychedelia, by, the, 1970s, blues, rock, had, become, heavier, and, more, riff, based, exemplified, by, the, work, of, led, zeppelin, and, deep, purple, and, the, lines, between, blues, rock, and, hard, rock, were, barely, visible, as, bands, began, recording, rock, style, albums, the, genre, was, continued, in, the, 1970s, by, figures, such, as, george, thorogood, and, pat, travers, but, particularly, on, the, british, scene, except, perhaps, for, the, advent, of, groups, such, as, status, quo, and, foghat, who, moved, towards, a, form, of, high, energy, and, repetitive, boogie, rock, bands, became, focused, on, heavy, metal, innovation, and, blues, rock, began, to, slip, out, of, the, mainstream, by, the, 1960s, the, scene, that, had, developed, out, of, the, american, folk, music, revival, had, grown, to, a, major, movement, using, traditional, music, and, new, compositions, in, a, traditional, style, usually, on, acoustic, instruments, in, america, the, genre, was, pioneered, by, figures, such, as, woody, guthrie, and, pete, seeger, and, often, identified, with, progressive, or, labor, politics, in, the, early, sixties, figures, such, as, joan, baez, and, bob, dylan, had, come, to, the, fore, in, this, movement, as, singer, songwriters, dylan, had, begun, to, reach, a, mainstream, audience, with, hits, including, blowin, in, the, wind, 1963, and, masters, of, war, 1963, which, brought, protest, songs, to, a, wider, public, but, although, beginning, to, influence, each, other, rock, and, folk, music, had, remained, largely, separate, genres, often, with, mutually, exclusive, audiences, early, attempts, to, combine, elements, of, folk, and, rock, included, the, animals, house, of, the, rising, sun, 1964, which, was, the, first, commercially, successful, folk, song, to, be, recorded, with, rock, and, roll, instrumentation, and, the, beatles, i, m, a, loser, 1964, arguably, the, first, beatles, song, to, be, influenced, directly, by, dylan, the, folk, rock, movement, is, usually, thought, to, have, taken, off, with, the, byrds, recording, of, dylan, s, mr, tambourine, man, which, topped, the, charts, in, 1965, with, members, who, had, been, part, of, the, caf, based, folk, scene, in, los, angeles, the, byrds, adopted, rock, instrumentation, including, drums, and, 12, string, rickenbacker, guitars, which, became, a, major, element, in, the, sound, of, the, genre, later, that, year, dylan, adopted, electric, instruments, much, to, the, outrage, of, many, folk, purists, with, his, like, a, rolling, stone, becoming, a, us, hit, single, according, to, ritchie, unterberger, dylan, even, before, his, adoption, of, electric, instruments, influenced, rock, musicians, like, the, beatles, demonstrating, to, the, rock, generation, in, general, that, an, album, could, be, a, major, standalone, statement, without, hit, singles, such, as, on, the, freewheelin, bob, dylan, 1963, folk, rock, particularly, took, off, in, california, where, it, led, acts, like, the, mamas, the, papas, and, crosby, stills, and, nash, to, move, to, electric, instrumentation, and, in, new, york, where, it, spawned, performers, including, the, lovin, spoonful, and, simon, and, garfunkel, with, the, latter, s, acoustic, the, sounds, of, silence, 1965, being, remixed, with, rock, instruments, to, be, the, first, of, many, hits, these, acts, directly, influenced, british, performers, like, donovan, and, fairport, convention, in, 1969, fairport, convention, abandoned, their, mixture, of, american, covers, and, dylan, influenced, songs, to, play, traditional, english, folk, music, on, electric, instruments, this, british, folk, rock, was, taken, up, by, bands, including, pentangle, steeleye, span, and, the, albion, band, which, in, turn, prompted, irish, groups, like, horslips, and, scottish, acts, like, the, jsd, band, spencer, s, feat, and, later, five, hand, reel, to, use, their, traditional, music, to, create, a, brand, of, celtic, rock, in, the, early, 1970s, folk, rock, reached, its, peak, of, commercial, popularity, in, the, period, 1967, 68, before, many, acts, moved, off, in, a, variety, of, directions, including, dylan, and, the, byrds, who, began, to, develop, country, rock, however, the, hybridization, of, folk, and, rock, has, been, seen, as, having, a, major, influence, on, the, development, of, rock, music, bringing, in, elements, of, psychedelia, and,

on, tight, spare, instrumentation, and, song, composition, its, referents, are, 50s, rock, country, music, and, rhythm, and, blues, and, its, key, inspiration, is, the, band, in, 1968, gram, parsons,

southern, rock, are, usually, thought, to, be, the, allman, brothers, band, who, developed, a, distinctive, sound, largely, derived, from, blues, rock, but, incorporating, elements, of, boogie, soul, and, country, in, the, early, 1970s, the, most, successful, act, to, follow, them, were, lynyrd, skynyrd, who, helped, establish, the, good, ol, boy, image, of, the, subgenre, and, the, general, shape, of, 1970s, guitar, rock, their, successors, included, the, fusion, progressive, instrumentalists, dixie, dregs, the, more, country, influenced, outlaws, funk, r, b, leaning, wet, willie, and, incorporating, elements, of, r, b, and, gospel, the, ozark, mountain, daredevils, after, the, loss, of, original, members, of, the, allmans, and, lynyrd, skynyrd, the, genre, began, to, fade, in, popularity, in, the, late, 1970s, but, was, sustained, the, 1980s, with, acts, like, 38, special, molly, hatchet, and, the, marshall, tucker, band, glam, rock, emerged, from, the, english, psychedelic, and, art, rock, scenes, of, the, late, 1960s, and, can, be, seen, as, both, an, extension, of, and, reaction, against, those, trends, musically, diverse, varying, between, the, simple, rock, and, roll, revivalism, of, figures, like, alvin, stardust, to, the, complex, art, rock, of, roxy, music, and, can, be, seen, as, much, as, a, fashion, as, a, musical, subgenre, visually, it, was, a, mesh, of, various, styles, ranging, from, 1930s, hollywood, glamor, through, 1950s, pin, up, sex, appeal, pre, war, cabaret, theatrics, victorian, literary, and, symbolist, styles, science, fiction, to, ancient, and, occult, mysticism, and, mythology, manifesting, itself, in, outrageous, clothes, makeup, hairstyles, and, platform, soled, boots, glam, is, most, noted, for, its, sexual, and, gender, ambiguity, and, representations, of, androgyny, beside, extensive, use, of, theatrics, it, was, prefigured, by, the, showmanship, and, gender, identity, manipulation, of, american, acts, such, as, the, cockettes, and, alice, cooper, the, origins, of, glam, rock, are, associated, with, marc, bolan, who, had, renamed, his, folk, duo, to, t, rex, and, taken, up, electric, instruments, by, the, end, of, the, 1960s, often, cited, as, the, moment, of, inception, is, his, appearance, on, the, bbc, music, show, top, of, the, pops, in, march, 1971, wearing, glitter, and, satins, to, perform, what, would, be, his, second, uk, top, 10, hit, and, first, uk, number, 1, hit, hot, love, from, 1971, already, a, minor, star, david, bowie, developed, his, ziggy, stardust, persona, incorporating, elements, of, professional, make, up, mime, and, performance, into, his, act, these, performers, were, soon, followed, in, the, style, by, acts, including, roxy, music, sweet, slade, mott, the, hoople, mud, and, alvin, stardust, while, highly, successful, in, the, single, charts, in, the, united, kingdom, very, few, of, these, musicians, were, able, to, make, a, serious, impact, in, the, united, states, bowie, was, the, major, exception, becoming, an, international, superstar, and, prompting, the, adoption, of, glam, styles, among, acts, like, lou, reed, iggy, pop, new, york, dolls, and, jobriath, often, known, as, glitter, rock, and, with, a, darker, lyrical, content, than, their, british, counterparts, in, the, uk, the, term, glitter, rock, was, most, often, used, to, refer, to, the, extreme, version, of, glam, pursued, by, gary, glitter, and, his, support, musicians, the, glitter, band, who, between, them, achieved, eighteen, top, ten, singles, in, the, uk, between, 1972, and, 1976, a, second, wave, of, glam, rock, acts, including, suzi, quatro, roy, wood, s, wizzard, and, sparks, dominated, the, british, single, charts, from, about, 1974, to, 1976, existing, acts, some, not, usually, considered, central, to, the, genre, also, adopted, glam, styles, including, rod, stewart, elton, john, queen, and, for, a, time, even, the, rolling, stones, it, was, also, a, direct, influence, on, acts, that, rose, to, prominence, later, including, kiss, and, adam, ant, and, less, directly, on, the, formation, of, gothic, rock, and, glam, metal, as, well, as, on, punk, rock, which, helped, end, the, fashion, for, glam, from, about, 1976, glam, has, since, enjoyed, sporadic, modest, revivals, through, bands, such, as, chainsaw, kittens, the, darkness, and, in, r, b, crossover, act, prince, after, the, early, successes, of, latin, rock, in, the, 1960s, chicano, musicians, like, carlos, santana, and, al, hurricane, continued, to, have, successful, careers, throughout, the, 1970s, santana, opened, the, decade, with, success, in, his, 1970, single, black, magic, woman, on, the, abraxas, album, his, third, album, santana, iii, yielded, the, single, no, one, to, depend, on, and, his, fourth, album, caravanserai, experimented, with, his, sound, to, mixed, reception, he, later, released, a, series, of, four, albums, that, all, achieved, gold, status, welcome, borboletta, amigos, and, festiv, l, al, hurricane, continued, to, mix, his, rock, music, with, new, mexico, music, though, he, was, also, experimenting, more, heavily, with, jazz, music, which, led, to, several, successful, singles, especially, on, his, vestido, mojado, album, including, the, eponymous, vestido, mojado, as, well, as, por, una, mujer, casada, and, pu, o, de, tierra, his, brothers, had, successful, new, mexico, music, singles, in, la, del, mo, o, colorado, by, tiny, morrie, and, la, cumbia, de, san, antone, by, baby, gaby, al, hurricane, jr, also, began, his, successful, rock, infused, new, mexico, music, recording, career, in, the, 1970s, with, his, 1976, rendition, of, flor, de, las, flores, los, lobos, gained, popularity, at, this, time, with, their, first, album, los, lobos, del, este, de, los, angeles, in, 1977, a, strange, time, 1971, although, rock, s, balkanization, into, genres, was, well, underway, it, was, often, hard, to, tell, one, catch, phrase, from, the, next, art, rock, could, mean, anything, from, the, velvets, to, the, moody, blues, and, although, led, zeppelin, was, launched, and, black, sabbath, celebrated, heavy, metal, remained, an, amorphous, concept, robert, christgau, from, the, late, 1960s, it, became, common, to, divide, mainstream, rock, music, into, soft, and, hard, rock, soft, rock, was, often, derived, from, folk, rock, using, acoustic, instruments, and, putting, more, emphasis, on, melody, and, harmonies, major, artists, included, carole, king, cat, stevens, and, james, taylor, it, reached, its, commercial, peak, in, the, mid, to, late, 1970s, with, acts, like, billy, joel, america, and, the, reformed, fleetwood, mac, whose, rumours, 1977, was, the, best, selling, album, of, the, decade, in, contrast, hard, rock, was, more, often, derived, from, blues, rock, and, was, played, louder, and, with, more, intensity, it, often, emphasised, the, electric, guitar, both, as, a, rhythm, instrument, using, simple, repetitive, riffs, and, as, a, solo, lead, instrument, and, was, more, likely, to, be, used, with, distortion, and, other, effects, key, acts, included, british, invasion, bands, like, the, kinks, as, well, as, psychedelic, era, performers, like, cream, jimi, hendrix, and, the, jeff, beck, group, hard, rock, influenced, bands, that, enjoyed, international, success, in, the, later, 1970s, included, queen, thin, lizzy, aerosmith, ac, dc, and, van, halen, from, the, late, 1960s, the, term, heavy, metal, began, to, be, used, to, describe, some, hard, rock, played, with, even, more, volume, and, intensity, first, as, an, adjective, and, by, the, early, 1970s, as, a, noun, the, term, was, first, used, in, music, in, steppenwolf, s, born, to, be, wild, 1967, and, began, to, be, associated, with, pioneer, bands, like, san, francisco, s, blue, cheer, cleveland, s, james, gang, and, michigan, s, grand, funk, railroad, by, 1970, three, key, british, bands, had, developed, the, characteristic, sounds, and, styles, which, would, help, shape, the, subgenre, led, zeppelin, added, elements, of, fantasy, to, their, riff, laden, blues, rock, deep, purple, brought, in, symphonic, and, medieval, interests, from, their, progressive, rock, phase, and, black, sabbath, introduced, facets, of, the, gothic, and, modal, harmony, helping, to, produce, a, darker, sound, these, elements, were, taken, up, by, a, second, generation, of, heavy, metal, bands, into, the, late, 1970s, including, judas, priest, ufo, mot, rhead, and, rainbow, from, britain, kiss, ted, nugent, and, blue, yster, cult, from, the, us, rush, from, canada, and, scorpions, from, germany, all, marking, the, expansion, in, popularity, of, the, subgenre, despite, a, lack, of, airplay, and, very, little, presence, on, the, singles, charts, late, 1970s, heavy, metal, built, a, considerable, following, particularly, among, adolescent, working, class, males, in, north, america, and, europe, in, the, 1980s, bands, such, as, bon, jovi, guns, n, roses, skid, row, and, def, leppard, saw, mainstream, success, with, hard, rock, and, a, fusion, of, hard, rock, with, pop, during, the, 1990s, hard, rock, saw, a, slight, decline, in, popularity, save, for, some, major, hits, like, guns, n, roses, november, rain, but, in, the, early, 2000s, bon, jovi, s, it, s, my, life, saw, a, huge, increase, in, popularity, of, rock, and, pop, rock, and, helped, introduce, the, genres, to, a, newer, fanbase, rock, mostly, the, heavy, metal, genre, has, been, criticized, by, some, christian, leaders, who, have, condemned, it, as, immoral, anti, christian, and, even, satanic, however, christian, rock, began, to, develop, in, the, late, 1960s, particularly, out, of, the, jesus, movement, beginning, in, southern, california, and, emerged, as, a, subgenre, in, the, 1970s, with, artists, like, larry, norman, usually, seen, as, the, first, major, star, of, christian, rock, the, genre, was, mostly, a, phenomenon, in, the, united, states, many, christian, rock, performers, have, ties, to, the, contemporary, christian, music, scene, starting, in, the, 1980s, christian, pop, performers, have, had, some, mainstream, success, while, these, artists, were, largely, acceptable, in, christian, communities, the, adoption, of, heavy, rock, and, glam, metal, styles, by, bands, like, stryper, who, achieved, considerable, mainstream, success, in, the, 1980s, was, more, controversial, from, the, 1990s, there, were, increasing, numbers, of, acts, who, attempted, to, avoid, the, christian, band, label, preferring, to, be, seen, as, groups, who, were, also, christians, including, p, o, d, american, working, class, oriented, heartland, rock, characterized, by, a, straightforward, musical, style, and, a, concern, with, the, lives, of, ordinary, blue, collar, american, people, developed, in, the, second, half, of, the, 1970s, the, term, heartland, rock, was, first, used, to, describe, midwestern, arena, rock, groups, like, kansas, reo, speedwagon, and, styx, but, which, came, to, be, associated, with, a, more, socially, concerned, form, of, roots, rock, more, directly, influenced, by, folk, country, and, rock, and, roll, it, has, been, seen, as, an, american, midwest, and, rust, belt, counterpart, to, west, coast, country, rock, and, the, southern, rock, of, the, american, south, led, by, figures, who, had, initially, been, identified, with, punk, and, new, wave, it, was, most, strongly, influenced, by, acts, such, as, bob, dylan, the, byrds, creedence, clearwater, revival, and, van, morrison, and, the, basic, rock, of, 1960s, garage, and, the, rolling, stones, exemplified, by, the, commercial, success, of, singer, songwriters, bruce, springsteen, bob, seger, and, tom, petty, along, with, less, widely, known, acts, such, as, southside, johnny, and, the, asbury, jukes, and, joe, grushecky, and, the, houserockers, it, was, partly, a, reaction, to, post, industrial, urban, decline, in, the, east, and, mid, west, often, dwelling, on, issues, of, social, disintegration, and, isolation, beside, a, form, of, good, time, rock, and, roll, revivalism, the, genre, reached, its, commercial, artistic, and, influential, peak, in, the, mid, 1980s, with, springsteen, s, born, in, the, usa, 1984, topping, the, charts, worldwide, and, spawning, a, series, of, top, ten, singles, together, with, the, arrival, of, artists, including, john, mellencamp, steve, earle, and, more, gentle, singer, songwriters, such, as, bruce, hornsby, it, can, also, be, heard, as, an, influence, on, artists, as, diverse, as, billy, joel, kid, rock, and, the, killers, heartland, rock, faded, away, as, a, recognized, genre, by, the, early, 1990s, as, rock, music, in, general, and, blue, collar, and, white, working, class, themes, in, particular, lost, influence, with, younger, audiences, and, as, heartland, s, artists, turned, to, more, personal, works, many, heartland, rock, artists, continued, to, record, with, critical, and, commercial, success, most, notably, bruce, springsteen, tom, petty, and, john, mellencamp, although, their, output, became, more, personal, and, experimental, no, longer, fitting, a, specific, genre, punk, rock, was, developed, between, 1974, and, 1976, in, the, united, states, and, the, united, kingdom, rooted, in, garage, rock, and, other, forms, of, what, is, now, known, as, protopunk, music, punk, rock, bands, eschewed, the, perceived, excesses, of, mainstream, 1970s, rock, they, created, fast, hard, edged, music, typically, with, short, songs, stripped, down, instrumentation, and, often, political, anti, establishment, lyrics, punk, embraces, a, diy, do, it, yourself, ethic, with, many, bands, self, producing, their, recordings, and, distributing, them, through, informal, channels, by, late, 1976, acts, such, as, the, ramones, and, patti, smith, in, new, york, city, and, the, sex, pistols, and, the, clash, in, london, were, recognized, as, the, vanguard, of, a, new, musical, movement, the, following, year, saw, punk, rock, spreading, around, the, world, punk, quickly, became, a, major, cultural, phenomenon, in, the, uk, the, sex, pistols, live, tv, skirmish, with, bill, grundy, on, 1, december, 1976, was, the, watershed, moment, in, british, punk, s, transformation, into, a, major, media, phenomenon, even, as, some, stores, refused, to, stock, the, records, and, radio, airplay, was, hard, to, come, by, in, may, 1977, the, sex, pistols, achieved, new, heights, of, controversy, and, number, two, on, the, singles, chart, with, a, song, that, referenced, queen, elizabeth, ii, god, save, the, queen, during, her, silver, jubilee, for, the, most, part, punk, took, root, in, local, scenes, that, tended, to, reject, association, with, the, mainstream, an, associated, punk, subculture, emerged, expressing, youthful, rebellion, and, characterized, by, distinctive, clothing, styles, and, a, variety, of, anti, authoritarian, ideologies, by, the, beginning, of, the, 1980s, faster, more, aggressive, styles, such, as, hardcore, and, oi, had, become, the, predominant, mode, of, punk, rock, this, has, resulted, in, several, evolved, strains, of, hardcore, punk, such, as, d, beat, a, distortion, heavy, subgenre, influenced, by, the, uk, band, discharge, anarcho, punk, such, as, crass, grindcore, such, as, napalm, death, and, crust, punk, musicians, identifying, with, or, inspired, by, punk, also, pursued, a, broad, range, of, other, variations, giving, rise, to, new, wave, post, punk, and, the, alternative, rock, movement, although, punk, rock, was, a, significant, social, and, musical, phenomenon, it, achieved, less, in, the, way, of, record, sales, being, distributed, by, small, specialty, labels, such, as, stiff, records, or, american, radio, airplay, as, the, radio, scene, continued, to, be, dominated, by, mainstream, formats, such, as, disco, and, album, oriented, rock, punk, rock, had, attracted, devotees, from, the, art, and, collegiate, world, and, soon, bands, sporting, a, more, literate, arty, approach, such, as, talking, heads, and, devo, began, to, infiltrate, the, punk, scene, in, some, quarters, the, description, new, wave, began, to, be, used, to, differentiate, these, less, overtly, punk, bands, record, executives, who, had, been, mostly, mystified, by, the, punk, movement, recognized, the, potential, of, the, more, accessible, new, wave, acts, and, began, aggressively, signing, and, marketing, any, band, that, could, claim, a, remote, connection, to, punk, or, new, wave, many, of, these, bands, such, as, the, cars, and, the, go, go, s, can, be, seen, as, pop, bands, marketed, as, new, wave, other, existing, acts, including, the, police, the, pretenders, and, elvis, costello, used, the, new, wave, movement, as, the, springboard, for, relatively, long, and, critically, successful, careers, while, skinny, tie, bands, exemplified, by, the, knack, or, the, photogenic, blondie, began, as, punk, acts, and, moved, into, more, commercial, territory, between, 1979, and, 1985, influenced, by, kraftwerk, yellow, magic, orchestra, david, bowie, and, gary, numan, british, new, wave, went, in, the, direction, of, such, new, romantics, as, spandau, ballet, ultravox, japan, duran, duran, a, flock, of, seagulls, culture, club, talk, talk, and, the, eurythmics, sometimes, using, the, synthesizer, to, replace, all, other, instruments, this, period, coincided, with, the, rise, of, mtv, and, led, to, a, great, deal, of, exposure, for, this, brand, of, synth, pop, creating, what, has, been, characterised, as, a, second, british, invasion, some, more, traditional, rock, bands, adapted, to, the, video, age, and, profited, from, mtv, s, airplay, most, obviously, dire, straits, whose, money, for, nothing, gently, poked, fun, at, the, station, despite, the, fact, that, it, had, helped, make, them, international, stars, but, in, general, guitar, oriented, rock, was, commercially, eclipsed, if, hardcore, most, directly, pursued, the, stripped, down, aesthetic, of, punk, and, new, wave, came, to, represent, its, commercial, wing, post, punk, emerged, in, the, later, 1970s, and, early, 1980s, as, its, more, artistic, and, challenging, side, major, influences, beside, punk, bands, were, the, velvet, underground, frank, zappa, and, captain, beefheart, and, the, new, york, based, no, wave, scene, which, placed, an, emphasis, on, performance, including, bands, such, as, james, chance, and, the, contortions, dna, and, sonic, youth, early, contributors, to, the, genre, included, the, us, bands, pere, ubu, devo, the, residents, and, talking, heads, the, first, wave, of, british, post, punk, included, gang, of, four, siouxsie, and, the, banshees, and, joy, division, who, placed, less, emphasis, on, art, than, their, us, counterparts, and, more, on, the, dark, emotional, qualities, of, their, music, bands, like, siouxsie, and, the, banshees, bauhaus, the, cure, and, the, sisters, of, mercy, moved, increasingly, in, this, direction, to, found, gothic, rock, which, had, become, the, basis, of, a, major, sub, culture, by, the, early, 1980s, similar, emotional, territory, was, pursued, by, australian, acts, like, the, birthday, party, and, nick, cave, members, of, bauhaus, and, joy, division, explored, new, stylistic, territory, as, love, and, rockets, and, new, order, respectively, another, early, post, punk, movement, was, the, industrial, music, developed, by, british, bands, throbbing, gristle, and, cabaret, voltaire, and, new, york, based, suicide, using, a, variety, of, electronic, and, sampling, techniques, that, emulated, the, sound, of, industrial, production, and, which, would, develop, into, a, variety, of, forms, of, post, industrial, music, in, the, 1980s, the, second, generation, of, british, post, punk, bands, that, broke, through, in, the, early, 1980s, including, the, fall, the, pop, group, the, mekons, echo, and, the, bunnymen, and, the, teardrop, explodes, tended, to, move, away, from, dark, sonic, landscapes, arguably, the, most, successful, band, to, emerge, from, post, punk, was, ireland, s, u2, who, incorporated, elements, of, religious, imagery, together, with, political, commentary, into, their, often, anthemic, music, and, by, the, late, 1980s, had, become, one, of, the, biggest, bands, in, the, world, although, many, post, punk, bands, continued, to, record, and, perform, it, declined, as, a, movement, in, the, mid, 1980s, as, acts, disbanded, or, moved, off, to, explore, other, musical, areas, but, it, has, continued, to, influence, the, development, of, rock, music, and, has, been, seen, as, a, major, element, in, the, creation, of, the, alternative, rock, movement, the, term, alternative, rock, was, coined, in, the, early, 1980s, to, describe, rock, artists, who, did, not, fit, into, the, mainstream, genres, of, the, time, bands, dubbed, alternative, had, no, unified, style, but, were, all, seen, as, distinct, from, mainstream, music, alternative, bands, were, linked, by, their, collective, debt, to, punk, rock, through, hardcore, new, wave, or, the, post, punk, movements, important, alternative, rock, bands, of, the, 1980s, in, the, us, included, r, e, m, h, sker, d, jane, s, addiction, sonic, youth, and, the, pixies, and, in, the, uk, the, cure, new, order, the, jesus, and, mary, chain, and, the, smiths, artists, were, largely, confined, to, independent, record, labels, building, an, extensive, underground, music, scene, based, on, college, radio, fanzines, touring, and, word, of, mouth, they, rejected, the, dominant, synth, pop, of, the, early, 1980s, marking, a, return, to, group, based, guitar, rock, few, of, these, early, bands, achieved, mainstream, success, although, exceptions, to, this, rule, include, r, e, m, the, smiths, and, the, cure, despite, a, general, lack, of, spectacular, album, sales, the, original, alternative, rock, bands, exerted, a, considerable, influence, on, the, generation, of, musicians, who, came, of, age, in, the, 1980s, and, ended, up, breaking, through, to, mainstream, success, in, the, 1990s, styles, of, alternative, rock, in, the, us, during, the, 1980s, included, jangle, pop, associated, with, the, early, recordings, of, r, e, m, which, incorporated, the, ringing, guitars, of, mid, 1960s, pop, and, rock, and, college, rock, used, to, describe, alternative, bands, that, began, in, the, college, circuit, and, college, radio, including, acts, such, as, 10, 000, maniacs, and, the, feelies, in, the, uk, gothic, rock, was, dominant, in, the, early, 1980s, but, by, the, end, of, the, decade, indie, or, dream, pop, like, primal, scream, bogshed, half, man, half, biscuit, and, the, wedding, present, and, what, were, dubbed, shoegaze, bands, like, my, bloody, valentine, slowdive, ride, and, lush, entered, particularly, vibrant, was, the, madchester, scene, producing, such, bands, as, happy, mondays, inspiral, carpets, and, the, stone, roses, the, next, decade, would, see, the, success, of, grunge, in, the, us, and, britpop, in, the, uk, bringing, alternative, rock, into, the, mainstream, disaffected, by, commercialized, and, highly, produced, pop, and, rock, in, the, mid, 1980s, bands, in, washington, state, particularly, in, the, seattle, area, formed, a, new, style, of, rock, which, sharply, contrasted, with, the, mainstream, music, of, the, time, the, developing, genre, came, to, be, known, as, grunge, a, term, descriptive, of, the, dirty, sound, of, the, music, and, the, unkempt, appearance, of, most, musicians, who, actively, rebelled, against, the, over, groomed, images, of, other, artists, grunge, fused, elements, of, hardcore, punk, and, heavy, metal, into, a, single, sound, and, made, heavy, use, of, guitar, distortion, fuzz, and, feedback, the, lyrics, were, typically, apathetic, and, angst, filled, and, often, concerned, themes, such, as, social, alienation, and, entrapment, although, it, was, also, known, for, its, dark, humor, and, parodies, of, commercial, rock, bands, such, as, green, river, soundgarden, melvins, and, skin, yard, pioneered, the, genre, with, mudhoney, becoming, the, most, successful, by, the, end, of, the, decade, grunge, remained, largely, a, local, phenomenon, until, 1991, when, nirvana, s, album, nevermind, became, a, huge, success, containing, the, anthemic, song, smells, like, teen, spirit, nevermind, was, more, melodic, than, its, predecessors, by, signing, to, geffen, records, the, band, was, one, of, the, first, to, employ, traditional, corporate, promotion, and, marketing, mechanisms, such, as, an, mtv, video, in, store, displays, and, the, use, of, radio, consultants, who, promoted, airplay, at, major, mainstream, rock, stations, during, 1991, and, 1992, other, grunge, albums, such, as, pearl, jam,

like, los, angeles, audioslave, and, georgia, s, collective, soul, and, beyond, the, us, to, australia, s, silverchair, and, britain, s, bush, who, all, cemented, post, grunge, as, one, of, the, most,

conventional, hard, rock, heavy, metal, or, electronic, music, sound, from, about, 1997, as, dissatisfaction, grew, with, the, concept, of, cool, britannia, and, britpop, as, a, movement, began, to, dissolve, emerging, bands, began, to, avoid, the, britpop, label, while, still, producing, music, derived, from, it, many, of, these, bands, tended, to, mix, elements, of, british, traditional, rock, or, british, trad, rock, particularly, the, beatles, rolling, stones, and, small, faces, with, american, influences, including, post, grunge, drawn, from, across, the, united, kingdom, with, several, important, bands, emerging, from, the, north, of, england, scotland, wales, and, northern, ireland, the, themes, of, their, music, tended, to, be, less, parochially, centered, on, british, english, and, london, life, and, more, introspective, than, had, been, the, case, with, britpop, at, its, height, this, beside, a, greater, willingness, to, engage, with, the, american, press, and, fans, may, have, helped, some, of, them, in, achieving, international, success, several, alternative, bands, that, had, enjoyed, some, success, during, the, mid, 1990s, but, did, not, find, major, commercial, success, until, the, late, 1990s, included, the, verve, and, radiohead, after, the, decline, of, britpop, they, began, to, gain, more, critical, and, popular, attention, the, verve, s, album, urban,

2000, post, britpop, bands, have, been, seen, as, presenting, the, image, of, the, rock, star, as, an, ordinary, person, and, their, increasingly, melodic, music, was, criticised, for, being, bland,

commercially, successful, acts, of, the, late, 1990s, and, early, 2000s, arguably, providing, a, launchpad, for, the, subsequent, garage, rock, revival, and, post, punk, revival, which, has, also, been, seen, as, a, reaction, to, their, introspective, brand, of, rock, post, hardcore, developed, in, the, us, particularly, in, the, chicago, and, washington, dc, areas, in, the, early, to, mid, 1980s, with, bands, that, were, inspired, by, the, do, it, yourself, ethics, and, guitar, heavy, music, of, hardcore, punk, but, influenced, by, post, punk, adopting, longer, song, formats, more,

greater, appeal, amongst, adolescents, than, its, earlier, incarnations, at, the, same, time, use, of, the, term, emo, expanded, beyond, the, musical, genre, becoming, associated, with, fashion, a, hairstyle, and, any, music, that, expressed, emotion, by, 2003, post, hardcore, bands, had, also, caught, the, attention, of, major, labels, and, began, to, enjoy, mainstream, success, in, the, album,

played, a, stripped, down, and, back, to, basics, version, of, guitar, rock, emerged, into, the, mainstream, they, were, variously, characterised, as, part, of, a, garage, rock, post, punk, or, new,

the, vines, from, australia, with, highly, evolved, 2002, they, were, christened, by, the, media, as, the, the, bands, and, dubbed, the, saviours, of, rock, n, roll, leading, to, accusations, of,
