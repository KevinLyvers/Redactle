a, portrait, is, a, painting, photograph, sculpture, or, other, artistic, representation, of, a, person, in, which, the, face, is, always, predominant, in, arts, a, portrait, can, be, represented, as, half, body, and, even, full, body, if, the, subject, in, full, body, better, represents, personality, and, mood, this, type, of, presentation, can, be, chosen, the, intent, is, to, display, the, likeness, personality, and, even, the, mood, of, the, person, for, this, reason, in, photography, a, portrait, is, generally, not, a, snapshot, but, a, composed, image, of, a, person, in, a, still, position, a, portrait, often, shows, a, person, looking, directly, at, the, painter, or, photographer, to, most, successfully, engage, the, subject, with, the, viewer, but, portrait, can, be, represented, as, a, profile, from, aside, and, 3, 4, plastered, human, skulls, were, reconstructed, human, skulls, that, were, made, in, the, ancient, levant, between, 9000, and, 6000, bc, in, the, pre, pottery, neolithic, b, period, they, represent, some, of, the, oldest, forms, of, art, in, the, middle, east, and, demonstrate, that, the, prehistoric, population, took, great, care, in, burying, their, ancestors, below, their, homes, the, skulls, denote, some, of, the, earliest, sculptural, examples, of, portraiture, in, the, history, of, art, most, early, representations, that, are, clearly, intended, to, show, an, individual, are, of, rulers, and, tend, to, follow, idealizing, artistic, conventions, rather, than, the, individual, features, of, the, subject, s, body, though, when, there, is, no, other, evidence, as, to, the, ruler, s, appearance, the, degree, of, idealization, can, be, hard, to, assess, nonetheless, many, subjects, such, as, akhenaten, and, some, other, egyptian, pharaohs, can, be, recognised, by, their, distinctive, features, the, 28, surviving, rather, small, statues, of, gudea, ruler, of, lagash, in, sumer, between, c, 2144, 2124, bc, show, a, consistent, appearance, with, some, individuality, although, it, is, sometimes, disputed, that, these, count, as, portraits, some, of, the, earliest, surviving, painted, portraits, of, people, who, were, not, rulers, are, the, greco, roman, funeral, portraits, that, survived, in, the, dry, climate, of, egypt, s, faiyum, district, these, are, almost, the, only, paintings, from, the, classical, world, that, have, survived, apart, from, frescos, though, many, sculptures, and, portraits, on, coins, have, fared, better, although, the, appearance, of, the, figures, differs, considerably, they, are, considerably, idealized, and, all, show, relatively, young, people, making, it, uncertain, whether, they, were, painted, from, life, the, art, of, the, portrait, flourished, in, ancient, greek, and, especially, roman, sculpture, where, sitters, demanded, individualized, and, realistic, portraits, even, unflattering, ones, during, the, 4th, century, the, portrait, began, to, retreat, in, favor, of, an, idealized, symbol, of, what, that, person, looked, like, compare, the, portraits, of, roman, emperors, constantine, i, and, theodosius, i, at, their, entries, in, the, europe, of, the, early, middle, ages, representations, of, individuals, are, mostly, generalized, true, portraits, of, the, outward, appearance, of, individuals, re, emerged, in, the, late, middle, ages, in, tomb, monuments, donor, portraits, miniatures, in, illuminated, manuscripts, and, then, panel, paintings, moche, culture, of, peru, was, one, of, the, few, ancient, civilizations, which, produced, portraits, these, works, accurately, represent, anatomical, features, in, great, detail, the, individuals, portrayed, would, have, been, recognizable, without, the, need, for, other, symbols, or, a, written, reference, to, their, names, the, individuals, portrayed, were, members, of, the, ruling, elite, priests, warriors, and, even, distinguished, artisans, they, were, represented, during, several, stages, of, their, lives, the, faces, of, gods, were, also, depicted, to, date, no, portraits, of, women, have, been, found, there, is, particular, emphasis, on, the, representation, of, the, details, of, headdresses, hairstyles, body, adornment, and, face, painting, one, of, the, best, known, portraits, in, the, western, world, is, leonardo, da, vinci, s, painting, titled, mona, lisa, which, is, a, painting, of, lisa, del, giocondo, what, has, been, claimed, as, the, world, s, oldest, known, portrait, was, found, in, 2006, in, the, vilhonneur, grotto, near, angoul, me, and, is, thought, to, be, 27, 000, years, old, when, the, artist, creates, a, portrait, of, himself, or, herself, it, is, called, a, self, portrait, identifiable, examples, become, numerous, in, the, late, middle, ages, but, if, the, definition, is, extended, the, first, was, by, the, egyptian, pharaoh, akhenaten, s, sculptor, bak, who, carved, a, representation, of, himself, and, his, wife, taheri, c, 1365, bc, however, it, seems, likely, that, self, portraits, go, back, to, the, cave, paintings, the, earliest, representational, art, and, literature, records, several, classical, examples, that, are, now, lost, official, portraits, are, photographs, of, important, personalities, such, as, kings, politicians, or, business, executives, the, portrait, is, usually, decorated, with, official, colors, and, symbols, such, as, a, flag, presidential, stripes, or, a, coat, of, arms, belonging, to, a, country, state, or, municipality, the, image, may, be, used, during, events, or, meetings, or, on, products, a, well, known, example, is, the, portraying, of, presidents, of, the, united, states, a, tradition, that, has, existed, since, the, country, s, founding, portrait, photography, is, a, popular, commercial, industry, all, over, the, world, many, people, enjoy, having, professionally, made, family, portraits, to, hang, in, their, homes, or, special, portraits, to, commemorate, certain, events, such, as, graduations, or, weddings, since, the, dawn, of, photography, people, have, made, portraits, the, popularity, of, the, daguerreotype, in, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, was, due, in, large, part, to, the, demand, for, inexpensive, portraiture, studios, sprang, up, in, cities, around, the, world, some, cranking, out, more, than, 500, plates, a, day, the, style, of, these, early, works, reflected, the, technical, challenges, associated, with, 30, second, exposure, times, and, the, painterly, aesthetic, of, the, time, subjects, were, generally, seated, against, plain, backgrounds, and, lit, with, the, soft, light, of, an, overhead, window, and, whatever, else, could, be, reflected, with, mirrors, as, photographic, techniques, developed, an, intrepid, group, of, photographers, took, their, talents, out, of, the, studio, and, onto, battlefields, across, oceans, and, into, remote, wilderness, william, shew, s, daguerreotype, saloon, roger, fenton, s, photographic, van, and, mathew, brady, s, what, is, it, wagon, set, the, standards, for, making, portraits, and, other, photographs, in, the, field, some, photographers, took, the, technique, to, other, countries, augustus, washington, moved, to, monrovia, liberia, from, hartford, connecticut, and, created, daguerreotype, portraits, for, many, political, leaders, for, the, country, in, politics, portraits, of, the, leader, are, often, used, as, a, symbol, of, the, state, in, most, countries, it, is, common, protocol, for, a, portrait, of, the, head, of, state, to, appear, in, important, government, buildings, in, literature, the, term, portrait, refers, to, a, written, description, or, analysis, of, a, person, or, thing, a, written, portrait, often, gives, deep, insight, and, offers, an, analysis, that, goes, far, beyond, the, superficial, for, example, the, american, author, patricia, cornwell, wrote, a, best, selling, 2002, book, entitled, portrait, of, a, killer, about, the, personality, background, and, possible, motivations, of, jack, the, ripper, as, well, as, the, media, coverage, of, his, murders, and, the, subsequent, police, investigation, of, his, crimes, however, in, literature, a, portrait, of, a, character, is, a, subtle, combination, of, fact, and, fiction, exploring, the, individual, psychology, of, the, character, in, the, wider, context, of, their, environment, when, the, subject, of, the, narrative, is, a, historical, figure, then, the, writer, is, free, to, create, a, compelling, and, dramatic, portrait, of, the, person, that, draws, on, imaginative, invention, for, verisimilitude, an, example, is, hilary, mantel, s, wolf, hall, 2009, which, while, acknowledging, the, work, of, the, historian, mary, robertson, for, background, information, imagines, an, intimate, portrait, of, thomas, cromwell, and, his, intense, relationship, with, henry, viii, at, a, critical, time, in, english, history, it, could, be, argued, that, in, literature, any, portrait, is, a, discreet, assembly, of, facts, anecdotes, and, author, s, insights, plutarch, s, parallel, lives, written, in, the, 2nd, century, ad, offer, a, prime, example, of, historical, literary, portraits, as, a, source, of, information, about, the, individuals, and, their, times, painted, portraits, can, also, play, a, role, in, literature, these, can, be, fictional, portraits, such, as, that, of, dorian, gray, in, the, eponymous, 1891, novel, by, oscar, wilde, but, sometimes, also, real, portraits, feature, in, literature, an, example, is, the, portrait, of, richard, iii, that, plays, a, role, in, josephine, tey, s, 1951, novel, the, daughter, of, time
