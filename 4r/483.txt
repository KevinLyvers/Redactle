mannerism, is, a, style, in, european, art, that, emerged, in, the, later, years, of, the, italian, high, renaissance, around, 1520, spreading, by, about, 1530, and, lasting, until, about, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, in, italy, when, the, baroque, style, largely, replaced, it, northern, mannerism, continued, into, the, early, 17th, century, mannerism, encompasses, a, variety, of, approaches, influenced, by, and, reacting, to, the, harmonious, ideals, associated, with, artists, such, as, leonardo, da, vinci, raphael, vasari, and, early, michelangelo, where, high, renaissance, art, emphasizes, proportion, balance, and, ideal, beauty, mannerism, exaggerates, such, qualities, often, resulting, in, compositions, that, are, asymmetrical, or, unnaturally, elegant, notable, for, its, artificial, as, opposed, to, naturalistic, qualities, this, artistic, style, privileges, compositional, tension, and, instability, rather, than, the, balance, and, clarity, of, earlier, renaissance, painting, mannerism, in, literature, and, music, is, notable, for, its, highly, florid, style, and, intellectual, sophistication, the, definition, of, mannerism, and, the, phases, within, it, continue, to, be, a, subject, of, debate, among, art, historians, for, example, some, scholars, have, applied, the, label, to, certain, early, modern, forms, of, literature, especially, poetry, and, music, of, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, the, term, is, also, used, to, refer, to, some, late, gothic, painters, working, in, northern, europe, from, about, 1500, to, 1530, especially, the, antwerp, mannerists, a, group, unrelated, to, the, italian, movement, mannerism, has, also, been, applied, by, analogy, to, the, silver, age, of, latin, literature, the, word, mannerism, derives, from, the, italian, maniera, meaning, style, or, manner, like, the, english, word, style, maniera, can, either, indicate, a, specific, type, of, style, a, beautiful, style, an, abrasive, style, or, indicate, an, absolute, that, needs, no, qualification, someone, has, style, in, the, second, edition, of, his, lives, of, the, most, excellent, painters, sculptors, and, architects, 1568, giorgio, vasari, used, maniera, in, three, different, contexts, to, discuss, an, artist, s, manner, or, method, of, working, to, describe, a, personal, or, group, style, such, as, the, term, maniera, greca, to, refer, to, the, medieval, italo, byzantine, style, or, simply, to, the, maniera, of, michelangelo, and, to, affirm, a, positive, judgment, of, artistic, quality, vasari, was, also, a, mannerist, artist, and, he, described, the, period, in, which, he, worked, as, la, maniera, moderna, or, the, modern, style, james, v, mirollo, describes, how, bella, maniera, poets, attempted, to, surpass, in, virtuosity, the, sonnets, of, petrarch, this, notion, of, bella, maniera, suggests, that, artists, who, were, thus, inspired, looked, to, copying, and, bettering, their, predecessors, rather, than, confronting, nature, directly, in, essence, bella, maniera, utilized, the, best, from, several, source, materials, synthesizing, it, into, something, new, as, a, stylistic, label, mannerism, is, not, easily, defined, it, was, used, by, swiss, historian, jacob, burckhardt, and, popularized, by, german, art, historians, in, the, early, 20th, century, to, categorize, the, seemingly, uncategorizable, art, of, the, italian, 16th, century, art, that, was, no, longer, found, to, exhibit, the, harmonious, and, rational, approaches, associated, with, the, high, renaissance, high, renaissance, connoted, a, period, distinguished, by, harmony, grandeur, and, the, revival, of, classical, antiquity, the, term, mannerist, was, redefined, in, 1967, by, john, shearman, following, the, exhibition, of, mannerist, paintings, organised, by, fritz, grossmann, at, manchester, city, art, gallery, in, 1965, yet, historians, differ, as, to, whether, mannerism, is, a, style, a, movement, or, a, period, some, authors, have, called, it, the, late, renaissance, although, the, term, remains, controversial, it, is, still, commonly, used, to, identify, european, art, and, culture, in, the, 16th, century, by, the, end, of, the, high, renaissance, young, artists, experienced, a, crisis, it, seemed, that, everything, that, could, be, achieved, was, already, achieved, no, more, difficulties, technical, or, otherwise, remained, to, be, solved, the, detailed, knowledge, of, anatomy, light, physiognomy, and, how, humans, register, emotion, in, expression, and, gesture, the, innovative, use, of, the, human, form, in, figurative, composition, and, the, use, of, the, subtle, gradation, of, tone, all, had, reached, near, perfection, the, young, artists, needed, to, find, a, new, goal, and, they, sought, new, approaches, at, this, point, mannerism, started, to, emerge, the, new, style, developed, between, 1510, and, 1520, either, in, florence, or, in, rome, or, both, cities, simultaneously, this, period, has, been, described, as, a, natural, extension, of, the, art, of, andrea, del, sarto, michelangelo, and, raphael, michelangelo, developed, his, style, at, an, early, age, a, deeply, original, one, that, was, greatly, admired, at, first, then, often, copied, and, imitated, by, other, artists, of, the, era, one, of, the, qualities, most, admired, by, his, contemporaries, was, his, terribilit, a, sense, of, awe, inspiring, grandeur, and, subsequent, artists, attempted, to, imitate, it, other, artists, learned, michelangelo, s, impassioned, and, highly, personal, style, by, copying, the, works, of, the, master, a, standard, way, that, students, learned, to, paint, and, sculpt, his, sistine, chapel, ceiling, provided, examples, for, them, to, follow, in, particular, his, representation, of, collected, figures, often, called, ignudi, and, of, the, libyan, sibyl, his, vestibule, to, the, laurentian, library, the, figures, on, his, medici, tombs, and, above, all, his, last, judgment, the, later, michelangelo, was, one, of, the, great, models, of, mannerism, young, artists, broke, into, his, house, and, stole, drawings, from, him, in, his, book, lives, of, the, most, eminent, painters, sculptors, and, architects, giorgio, vasari, noted, that, michelangelo, stated, once, those, who, are, followers, can, never, pass, by, whom, they, follow, the, competitive, spirit, was, cultivated, by, patrons, who, encouraged, sponsored, artists, to, emphasize, virtuosic, technique, and, to, compete, with, one, another, for, commissions, it, drove, artists, to, look, for, new, approaches, and, dramatically, illuminated, scenes, elaborate, clothes, and, compositions, elongated, proportions, highly, stylized, poses, and, a, lack, of, clear, perspective, leonardo, da, vinci, and, michelangelo, were, each, given, a, commission, by, gonfaloniere, piero, soderini, to, decorate, a, wall, in, the, hall, of, five, hundred, in, florence, these, two, artists, were, set, to, paint, side, by, side, and, compete, against, each, other, fueling, the, incentive, to, be, as, innovative, as, possible, the, early, mannerists, in, florence, especially, the, students, of, andrea, del, sarto, such, as, jacopo, da, pontormo, and, rosso, fiorentino, are, notable, for, elongated, forms, precariously, balanced, poses, a, collapsed, perspective, irrational, settings, and, theatrical, lighting, parmigianino, a, student, of, correggio, and, giulio, romano, raphael, s, head, assistant, were, moving, in, similarly, stylized, aesthetic, directions, in, rome, these, artists, had, matured, under, the, influence, of, the, high, renaissance, and, their, style, has, been, characterized, as, a, reaction, to, or, exaggerated, extension, of, it, instead, of, studying, nature, directly, younger, artists, began, studying, hellenistic, sculpture, and, paintings, of, masters, past, therefore, this, style, is, often, identified, as, anti, classical, yet, at, the, time, it, was, considered, a, natural, progression, from, the, high, renaissance, the, earliest, experimental, phase, of, mannerism, known, for, its, anti, classical, forms, lasted, until, about, 1540, or, 1550, marcia, b, hall, professor, of, art, history, at, temple, university, notes, in, her, book, after, raphael, that, raphael, s, premature, death, marked, the, beginning, of, mannerism, in, rome, in, past, analyses, it, has, been, noted, that, mannerism, arose, in, the, early, 16th, century, contemporaneously, with, a, number, of, other, social, scientific, religious, and, political, movements, such, as, the, copernican, heliocentrism, the, sack, of, rome, in, 1527, and, the, protestant, reformation, s, increasing, challenge, to, the, power, of, the, catholic, church, because, of, this, the, style, s, elongated, forms, and, distorted, forms, were, once, interpreted, as, a, reaction, to, the, idealized, compositions, prevalent, in, high, renaissance, art, this, explanation, for, the, radical, stylistic, shift, c, 1520, has, fallen, out, of, scholarly, favor, though, early, mannerist, art, is, still, sharply, contrasted, with, high, renaissance, conventions, the, accessibility, and, balance, achieved, by, raphael, s, school, of, athens, no, longer, seemed, to, interest, young, artists, the, second, period, of, mannerism, is, commonly, differentiated, from, the, earlier, so, called, anti, classical, phase, subsequent, mannerists, stressed, intellectual, conceits, and, artistic, virtuosity, features, that, have, led, later, critics, to, accuse, them, of, working, in, an, unnatural, and, affected, manner, maniera, maniera, artists, looked, to, their, older, contemporary, michelangelo, as, their, principal, model, theirs, was, an, art, imitating, art, rather, than, an, art, imitating, nature, art, historian, sydney, joseph, freedberg, argues, that, the, intellectualizing, aspect, of, maniera, art, involves, expecting, its, audience, to, notice, and, appreciate, this, visual, reference, a, familiar, figure, in, an, unfamiliar, setting, enclosed, between, unseen, but, felt, quotation, marks, the, height, of, artifice, is, the, maniera, painter, s, penchant, for, deliberately, misappropriating, a, quotation, agnolo, bronzino, and, giorgio, vasari, exemplify, this, strain, of, maniera, that, lasted, from, about, 1530, to, 1580, based, largely, at, courts, and, in, intellectual, circles, around, europe, maniera, art, couples, exaggerated, elegance, with, exquisite, attention, to, surface, and, detail, porcelain, skinned, figures, recline, in, an, even, tempered, light, acknowledging, the, viewer, with, a, cool, glance, if, they, make, eye, contact, at, all, the, maniera, subject, rarely, displays, much, emotion, and, for, this, reason, works, exemplifying, this, trend, are, often, called, cold, or, aloof, this, is, typical, of, the, so, called, stylish, style, or, maniera, in, its, maturity, the, cities, rome, florence, and, mantua, were, mannerist, centers, in, italy, venetian, painting, pursued, a, different, course, represented, by, titian, in, his, long, career, a, number, of, the, earliest, mannerist, artists, who, had, been, working, in, rome, during, the, 1520s, fled, the, city, after, the, sack, of, rome, in, 1527, as, they, spread, out, across, the, continent, in, search, of, employment, their, style, was, disseminated, throughout, italy, and, northern, europe, the, result, was, the, first, international, artistic, style, since, the, gothic, other, parts, of, northern, europe, did, not, have, the, advantage, of, such, direct, contact, with, italian, artists, but, the, mannerist, style, made, its, presence, felt, through, prints, and, illustrated, books, european, rulers, among, others, purchased, italian, works, while, northern, european, artists, continued, to, travel, to, italy, helping, to, spread, the, mannerist, style, individual, italian, artists, working, in, the, north, gave, birth, to, a, movement, known, as, the, northern, mannerism, francis, i, of, france, for, example, was, presented, with, bronzino, s, venus, cupid, folly, and, time, the, style, waned, in, italy, after, 1580, as, a, new, generation, of, artists, including, the, carracci, brothers, caravaggio, and, cigoli, revived, naturalism, walter, friedlaender, identified, this, period, as, anti, mannerism, just, as, the, early, mannerists, were, anti, classical, in, their, reaction, away, from, the, aesthetic, values, of, the, high, renaissance, 14, and, today, the, carracci, brothers, and, caravaggio, are, agreed, to, have, begun, the, transition, to, baroque, style, painting, which, was, dominant, by, 1600, outside, of, italy, however, mannerism, continued, into, the, 17th, century, in, france, where, rosso, traveled, to, work, for, the, court, at, fontainebleau, it, is, known, as, the, henry, ii, style, and, had, a, particular, impact, on, architecture, other, important, continental, centers, of, northern, mannerism, include, the, court, of, rudolf, ii, in, prague, as, well, as, haarlem, and, antwerp, mannerism, as, a, stylistic, category, is, less, frequently, applied, to, english, visual, and, decorative, arts, where, native, labels, such, as, elizabethan, and, jacobean, are, more, commonly, applied, seventeenth, century, artisan, mannerism, is, one, exception, applied, to, architecture, that, relies, on, pattern, books, rather, than, on, existing, precedents, in, continental, europe, of, particular, note, is, the, flemish, influence, at, fontainebleau, that, combined, the, eroticism, of, the, french, style, with, an, early, version, of, the, vanitas, tradition, that, would, dominate, seventeenth, century, dutch, and, flemish, painting, prevalent, at, this, time, was, the, pittore, vago, a, description, of, painters, from, the, north, who, entered, the, workshops, in, france, and, italy, to, create, a, truly, international, style, as, in, painting, early, italian, mannerist, sculpture, was, very, largely, an, attempt, to, find, an, original, style, that, would, top, the, achievement, of, the, high, renaissance, which, in, sculpture, essentially, meant, michelangelo, and, much, of, the, struggle, to, achieve, this, was, played, out, in, commissions, to, fill, other, places, in, the, piazza, della, signoria, in, florence, next, to, michelangelo, s, david, baccio, bandinelli, took, over, the, project, of, hercules, and, cacus, from, the, master, himself, but, it, was, little, more, popular, then, than, it, is, now, and, maliciously, compared, by, benvenuto, cellini, to, a, sack, of, melons, though, it, had, a, long, lasting, effect, in, apparently, introducing, relief, panels, on, the, pedestal, of, statues, like, other, works, of, his, and, other, mannerists, it, removes, far, more, of, the, original, block, than, michelangelo, would, have, done, cellini, s, bronze, perseus, with, the, head, of, medusa, is, certainly, a, masterpiece, designed, with, eight, angles, of, view, another, mannerist, characteristic, and, artificially, stylized, in, comparison, with, the, david, s, of, michelangelo, and, donatello, originally, a, goldsmith, his, famous, gold, and, enamel, salt, cellar, 1543, was, his, first, sculpture, and, shows, his, talent, at, its, best, small, bronze, figures, for, collector, s, cabinets, often, mythological, subjects, with, nudes, were, a, popular, renaissance, form, at, which, giambologna, originally, flemish, but, based, in, florence, excelled, in, the, later, part, of, the, century, he, also, created, life, size, sculptures, of, which, two, entered, the, collection, in, the, piazza, della, signoria, he, and, his, followers, devised, elegant, elongated, examples, of, the, figura, serpentinata, often, of, two, intertwined, figures, that, were, interesting, from, all, angles, giorgio, vasari, s, opinions, about, the, art, of, painting, emerge, in, the, praise, he, bestows, on, fellow, artists, in, his, multi, volume, lives, of, the, artists, he, believed, that, excellence, in, painting, demanded, refinement, richness, of, invention, invenzione, expressed, through, virtuoso, technique, maniera, and, wit, and, study, that, appeared, in, the, finished, work, all, criteria, that, emphasized, the, artist, s, intellect, and, the, patron, s, sensibility, the, artist, was, now, no, longer, just, a, trained, member, of, a, local, guild, of, st, luke, now, he, took, his, place, at, court, alongside, scholars, poets, and, humanists, in, a, climate, that, fostered, an, appreciation, for, elegance, and, complexity, the, coat, of, arms, of, vasari, s, medici, patrons, appears, at, the, top, of, his, portrait, quite, as, if, it, were, the, artist, s, own, the, framing, of, the, woodcut, image, of, vasari, s, lives, would, be, called, jacobean, in, an, english, speaking, milieu, in, it, michelangelo, s, medici, tombs, inspire, the, anti, architectural, architectural, features, at, the, top, the, papery, pierced, frame, the, satyr, nudes, at, the, base, as, a, mere, frame, it, is, extravagant, mannerist, in, short, another, literary, figure, from, the, period, is, gian, paolo, lomazzo, who, produced, two, works, one, practical, and, one, metaphysical, that, helped, define, the, mannerist, artist, s, self, conscious, relation, to, his, art, his, trattato, dell, arte, della, pittura, scoltura, et, architettura, milan, 1584, is, in, part, a, guide, to, contemporary, concepts, of, decorum, which, the, renaissance, inherited, in, part, from, antiquity, but, mannerism, elaborated, upon, lomazzo, s, systematic, codification, of, aesthetics, which, typifies, the, more, formalized, and, academic, approaches, typical, of, the, later, 16th, century, emphasized, a, consonance, between, the, functions, of, interiors, and, the, kinds, of, painted, and, sculpted, decors, that, would, be, suitable, iconography, often, convoluted, and, abstruse, is, a, more, prominent, element, in, the, mannerist, styles, his, less, practical, and, more, metaphysical, idea, del, tempio, della, pittura, the, ideal, temple, of, painting, milan, 1590, offers, a, description, along, the, lines, of, the, four, temperaments, theory, of, human, nature, and, personality, defining, the, role, of, individuality, in, judgment, and, artistic, invention, mannerism, was, an, anti, classical, movement, which, differed, greatly, from, the, aesthetic, ideologies, of, the, renaissance, though, mannerism, was, initially, accepted, with, positivity, based, on, the, writings, of, vasari, it, was, later, regarded, in, a, negative, light, because, it, solely, view, as, an, alteration, of, natural, truth, and, a, trite, repetition, of, natural, formulas, as, an, artistic, moment, mannerism, involves, many, characteristics, that, are, unique, and, specific, to, experimentation, of, how, art, is, perceived, below, is, a, list, of, many, specific, characteristics, that, mannerist, artists, would, employ, in, their, artworks, jacopo, da, pontormo, s, work, is, one, of, the, most, important, contributions, to, mannerism, he, often, drew, his, subject, matter, from, religious, narratives, heavily, influenced, by, the, works, of, michelangelo, he, frequently, alludes, to, or, uses, sculptural, forms, as, models, for, his, compositions, a, well, known, element, of, his, work, is, the, rendering, of, gazes, by, various, figures, which, often, pierce, out, at, the, viewer, in, various, directions, dedicated, to, his, work, pontormo, often, expressed, anxiety, about, its, quality, and, was, known, to, work, slowly, and, methodically, his, legacy, is, highly, regarded, as, he, influenced, artists, such, as, agnolo, bronzino, and, the, aesthetic, ideals, of, late, mannerism, pontormo, s, joseph, in, egypt, painted, in, 1517, portrays, a, running, narrative, of, four, biblical, scenes, in, which, joseph, reconnects, with, his, family, on, the, left, side, of, the, composition, pontomoro, depicts, a, scene, of, joseph, introducing, his, family, to, the, pharaoh, of, egypt, on, the, right, joseph, is, riding, on, a, rolling, bench, as, cherubs, fill, the, composition, around, him, in, addition, to, other, figures, and, large, rocks, on, a, path, in, the, distance, above, these, scenes, is, a, spiral, staircase, which, joseph, guides, one, his, sons, to, their, mother, at, the, top, the, final, scene, on, the, right, is, the, final, stage, of, jacob, s, death, as, his, sons, watch, nearby, pontormo, s, joseph, in, egypt, features, many, mannerist, elements, one, element, is, utilization, of, incongruous, colors, such, as, various, shades, of, pinks, and, blues, which, make, up, a, majority, of, the, canvas, an, additional, element, of, mannerism, is, the, incoherent, handling, of, time, about, the, story, of, joseph, through, various, scenes, and, use, of, space, through, the, inclusion, of, the, four, different, narratives, ponotormo, creates, a, cluttered, composition, and, overall, sense, of, busyness, rosso, fiorentino, who, had, been, a, fellow, pupil, of, pontormo, in, the, studio, of, andrea, del, sarto, in, 1530, brought, florentine, mannerism, to, fontainebleau, where, he, became, one, of, the, founders, of, french, 16th, century, mannerism, popularly, known, as, the, school, of, fontainebleau, the, examples, of, a, rich, and, hectic, decorative, style, at, fontainebleau, further, disseminated, the, italian, style, through, the, medium, of, engravings, to, antwerp, and, from, there, throughout, northern, europe, from, london, to, poland, mannerist, design, was, extended, to, luxury, goods, like, silver, and, carved, furniture, a, sense, of, tense, controlled, emotion, expressed, in, elaborate, symbolism, and, allegory, and, an, ideal, of, female, beauty, characterized, by, elongated, proportions, are, features, of, this, style, agnolo, bronzino, was, a, pupil, of, pontormo, whose, style, was, very, influential, and, often, confusing, in, terms, of, figuring, out, the, attribution, of, many, artworks, during, his, career, bronzino, also, collaborated, with, vasari, as, a, set, designer, for, the, production, comedy, of, magicians, where, he, painted, many, portraits, bronzino, s, work, was, sought, after, and, he, enjoyed, great, success, when, he, became, a, court, painter, for, the, medici, family, in, 1539, a, unique, mannerist, characteristic, of, bronzino, s, work, was, the, rendering, of, milky, complexions, in, the, painting, venus, cupid, folly, and, time, bronzino, portrays, an, erotic, scene, that, leaves, the, viewer, with, more, questions, than, answers, in, the, foreground, cupid, and, venus, are, nearly, engaged, in, a, kiss, but, pause, as, if, caught, in, the, act, above, the, pair, are, mythological, figures, father, time, on, the, right, who, pulls, a, curtain, to, reveal, the, pair, and, the, representation, of, the, goddess, of, the, night, on, the, left, the, composition, also, involves, a, grouping, of, masks, a, hybrid, creature, composed, of, features, of, a, girl, and, a, serpent, and, a, man, depicted, in, agonizing, pain, many, theories, are, available, for, the, painting, such, as, it, conveying, the, dangers, of, syphilis, or, that, the, painting, functioned, as, a, court, game, mannerist, portraits, by, bronzino, are, distinguished, by, a, serene, elegance, and, meticulous, attention, to, detail, as, a, result, bronzino, s, sitters, have, been, said, to, project, an, aloofness, and, marked, emotional, distance, from, the, viewer, there, is, also, a, virtuosic, concentration, on, capturing, the, precise, pattern, and, sheen, of, rich, textiles, specifically, within, the, venus, cupid, folly, and, time, bronzino, utilizes, the, tactics, of, mannerist, movement, attention, to, detail, color, and, sculptural, forms, evidence, of, mannerist, movement, is, apparent, in, the, awkward, movements, of, cupid, and, venus, as, they, contort, their, bodies, to, partly, embrace, particularly, bronzino, paints, the, complexion, with, the, many, forms, as, a, perfect, porcelain, white, with, a, smooth, effacement, of, their, muscles, which, provides, a, reference, to, the, smoothness, of, sculpture, alessandro, allori, s, 1535, 1607, susanna, and, the, elders, below, is, distinguished, by, latent, eroticism, and, consciously, brilliant, still, life, detail, in, a, crowded, contorted, composition, jacopo, tintoretto, has, been, known, for, his, vastly, different, contributions, to, venetian, painting, after, the, legacy, of, titian, his, work, which, differed, greatly, from, his, predecessors, had, been, criticized, by, vasari, for, its, fantastical, extravagant, bizarre, style, within, his, work, tintoretto, adopted, mannerist, elements, that, have, distanced, him, from, the, classical, notion, of, venetian, painting, as, he, often, created, artworks, which, contained, elements, of, fantasy, and, retained, naturalism, other, unique, elements, of, tintoretto, s, work, include, his, attention, to, color, through, the, regular, utilization, of, rough, brushstrokes, and, experimentation, with, pigment, to, create, illusion, an, artwork, that, is, associated, with, mannerist, characteristics, is, the, last, supper, it, was, commissioned, by, michele, alabardi, for, the, san, giorgio, maggiore, in, 1591, in, tintoretto, s, last, supper, the, scene, is, portrayed, from, the, angle, of, group, of, people, along, the, right, side, of, the, composition, on, the, left, side, of, the, painting, christ, and, the, apostles, occupy, one, side, of, the, table, and, single, out, judas, within, the, dark, space, there, are, few, sources, of, light, one, source, is, emitted, by, christ, s, halo, and, hanging, torch, above, the, table, in, its, distinct, composition, the, last, supper, portrays, mannerist, characteristics, one, characteristic, that, tintoretto, utilizes, is, a, black, background, though, the, painting, gives, some, indication, of, an, interior, space, through, the, use, of, perspective, the, edges, of, the, composition, are, mostly, shrouded, in, shadow, which, provides, drama, for, the, central, scene, of, the, last, supper, additionally, tintoretto, utilizes, the, spotlight, effects, with, light, especially, with, the, halo, of, christ, and, the, hanging, torch, above, the, table, a, third, mannerist, characteristic, that, tintoretto, employs, are, the,

composition, and, message, one, element, is, the, flat, black, background, which, arcimboldo, utilizes, to, emphasize, the, status, and, identity, of, the, emperor, as, well, as, highlighting, the, fantasy, of, his, reign, in, the, portrait, of, rudolf, ii, arcimboldo, also, strays, away, from, the, naturalistic, representation, of, the, renaissance, and, explores, the, construction, of, composition, by, rendering, him, from, a, jumble, of, fruits, vegetables, plants, and, flowers, another, element, of, mannerism, which, the, painting, portrays, is, the, dual, narrative, of, a, joke, and, serious, message, humor, wasn, t, normally, utilized, in, renaissance, artworks, mannerist, architecture, was, characterized, by, visual, trickery, and, unexpected, elements, that, challenged, the, renaissance, norms, flemish, artists, many, of, whom, had, traveled, to, italy, and, were, influenced, by, mannerist, developments, there, were, responsible, for, the, spread, of, mannerist, trends, into, europe, north, of, the, alps, including, into, the, realm, of, architecture, during, the, period, architects, experimented, with, using, architectural, forms, to, emphasize, solid, and, spatial, relationships, the, renaissance, ideal, of, harmony, gave, way, to, freer, and, more, imaginative, rhythms, the, best, known, architect, associated, with, the, mannerist, style, and, a, pioneer, at, the, laurentian, library, was, michelangelo, 1475, 1564, he, is, credited, with, inventing, the, giant, order, a, large, pilaster, or, column, that, stretches, from, the, bottom, to, the, top, of, a, multi, storey, fa, ade, he, used, this, in, his, design, for, the, piazza, del, campidoglio, in, rome, the, herrerian, style, spanish, estilo, herreriano, or, arquitectura, herreriana, of, architecture, was, developed, in, spain, during, the, last, third, of, the, 16th, century, under, the, reign, of, philip, ii, 1556, 1598, and, continued, in, force, in, the, 17th, century, but, transformed, by, the, baroque, style, of, the, time, it, corresponds, to, the, third, and, final, stage, of, the, spanish, renaissance, architecture, which, evolved, into, a, progressive, purification, ornamental, from, the, initial, plateresque, to, classical, purism, of, the, second, third, of, the, 16th, century, and, total, nudity, decorative, that, introduced, the, herrerian, style, prior, to, the, 20th, century, the, term, mannerism, had, negative, connotations, but, it, is, now, used, to, describe, the, historical, period, in, more, general, non, judgmental, terms, mannerist, architecture, has, also, been, used, to, describe, a, trend, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, that, involved, breaking, the, norms, of, modernist, architecture, while, at, the, same, time, recognizing, their, existence, defining, mannerism, in, this, context, architect, and, author, robert, venturi, wrote, mannerism, for, architecture, of, our, time, that, acknowledges, conventional, order, rather, than, original, expression, but, breaks, the, conventional, order, to, accommodate, complexity, and, contradiction, and, thereby, engages, ambiguity, unambiguously, an, example, of, mannerist, architecture, is, the, villa, farnese, at, caprarola, in, the, rugged, countryside, outside, of, rome, the, proliferation, of, engravers, during, the, 16th, century, spread, mannerist, styles, more, quickly, than, any, previous, styles, dense, with, ornament, of, roman, detailing, the, display, doorway, at, colditz, castle, exemplifies, the, northern, style, characteristically, applied, as, an, isolated, set, piece, against, unpretentious, vernacular, walling, from, the, late, 1560s, onwards, many, buildings, in, valletta, the, new, capital, city, of, malta, were, designed, by, the, architect, girolamo, cassar, in, the, mannerist, style, such, buildings, include, st, john, s, co, cathedral, the, grandmaster, s, palace, and, the, seven, original, auberges, many, of, cassar, s, buildings, were, modified, over, the, years, especially, in, the, baroque, period, however, a, few, buildings, such, as, auberge, d, aragon, and, the, exterior, of, st, john, s, co, cathedral, retain, most, of, cassar, s, original, mannerist, design, while, many, architectural, styles, explore, harmonious, ideals, mannerism, wants, to, take, style, a, step, further, and, explores, the, aesthetics, of, hyperbole, and, exaggeration, mannerism, is, notable, for, its, intellectual, sophistication, as, well, as, its, artificial, as, opposed, to, naturalistic, qualities, mannerism, favours, compositional, tension, and, instability, rather, than, balance, and, clarity, the, definition, of, mannerism, and, the, phases, within, it, continues, to, be, the, subject, of, debate, among, art, historians, northern, or, antwerp, mannerism, predates, and, is, distinct, from, italian, mannerism, antwerp, during, its, 16th, century, boom, produced, a, style, that, was, the, last, phase, of, early, netherlandish, painting, with, early, renaissance, elements, through, antwerp, renaissance, and, mannerist, styles, were, widely, introduced, in, england, germany, and, northern, and, eastern, europe, in, general, literary, mannerism, involved, such, figures, as, michelangelo, cl, ment, marot, giovanni, della, casa, giovanni, battista, guarini, torquato, tasso, veronica, franco, miguel, de, cervantes, and, others, in, english, literature, mannerism, is, commonly, identified, with, the, qualities, of, the, metaphysical, poets, of, whom, the, most, famous, is, john, donne, the, witty, sally, of, a, baroque, writer, john, dryden, against, the, verse, of, donne, in, the, previous, generation, affords, a, concise, contrast, between, baroque, and, mannerist, aims, in, the, arts, he, affects, the, metaphysics, not, only, in, his, satires, but, in, his, amorous, verses, where, nature, only, should, reign, and, perplexes, the, minds, of, the, fair, sex,

the, poetry, of, the, late, 16th, and, early, 17th, centuries, provided, an, attractive, basis, for, the, madrigal, which, quickly, rose, to, prominence, as, the, pre, eminent, musical, form, in, italian, musical, culture, as, discussed, by, tim, carter, the, madrigal, particularly, in, its, aristocratic, guise, was, obviously, a, vehicle, for, the, stylish, style, of, mannerism, with, poets, and, musicians, revelling, in, witty, conceits, and, other, visual, verbal, and, musical, tricks, to, delight, the, connoisseur, the, word, mannerism, has, also, been, used, to, describe, the, style, of, highly, florid, and, contrapuntally, complex, polyphonic, music, made, in, france, in, the, late, 14th, century, this, period, is, now, usually, referred, to, as, the, ars, subtilior, the, early,

the, style, was, heavily, influenced, by, both, the, jewish, community, as, well, as, the, african, american, community, leading, to, the, beauty, of, the, ghetto, exhibition, between, 1972, and, 1979, the, exhibition, toured, major, american, cities, and, was, hosted, by, dignitaries, professional, athletes, and, celebrities, when, the, exhibition, was, on, view, in, 1974, at, the, museum,
