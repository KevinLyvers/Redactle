social, and, technological, innovations, or, as, an, outlet, to, anticipate, future, scientific, and, technological, innovations, besides, providing, entertainment, it, can, also, criticize, present,

deal, with, some, form, of, speculative, science, based, conceit, such, as, a, society, on, earth, or, another, planet, that, has, developed, in, wholly, different, ways, from, our, own, part, of, the, reason, that, it, is, so, difficult, to, pin, down, an, agreed, definition, of, science, fiction, is, because, there, is, a, tendency, among, science, fiction, enthusiasts, to, act, as, their,

insufficient, for, certain, types, of, works, in, this, genre, and, suggested, the, term, speculative, fiction, to, be, used, instead, for, those, that, are, more, serious, or, thoughtful, some,
