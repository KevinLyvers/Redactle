ancient, egyptian, literature, was, written, with, the, egyptian, language, from, ancient, egypt, s, pharaonic, period, until, the, end, of, roman, domination, it, represents, the, oldest, corpus, of, egyptian, literature, along, with, sumerian, literature, it, is, considered, the, world, s, earliest, literature, writing, in, ancient, egypt, both, hieroglyphic, and, hieratic, first, appeared, in, the, late, 4th, millennium, bc, during, the, late, phase, of, predynastic, egypt, by, the, old, kingdom, 26th, century, bc, to, 22nd, century, bc, literary, works, included, funerary, texts, epistles, and, letters, hymns, and, poems, and, commemorative, autobiographical, texts, recounting, the, careers, of, prominent, administrative, officials, it, was, not, until, the, early, middle, kingdom, 21st, century, bc, to, 17th, century, bc, that, a, narrative, egyptian, literature, was, created, this, was, a, media, revolution, which, according, to, richard, b, parkinson, was, the, result, of, the, rise, of, an, intellectual, class, of, scribes, new, cultural, sensibilities, about, individuality, unprecedented, levels, of, literacy, and, mainstream, access, to, written, materials, the, creation, of, literature, was, thus, an, elite, exercise, monopolized, by, a, scribal, class, attached, to, government, offices, and, the, royal, court, of, the, ruling, pharaoh, however, there, is, no, full, consensus, among, modern, scholars, concerning, the, dependence, of, ancient, egyptian, literature, on, the, sociopolitical, order, of, the, royal, courts, middle, egyptian, the, spoken, language, of, the, middle, kingdom, became, a, classical, language, during, the, new, kingdom, 16th, century, bc, to, 11th, century, bc, when, the, vernacular, language, known, as, late, egyptian, first, appeared, in, writing, scribes, of, the, new, kingdom, canonized, and, copied, many, literary, texts, written, in, middle, egyptian, which, remained, the, language, used, for, oral, readings, of, sacred, hieroglyphic, texts, some, genres, of, middle, kingdom, literature, such, as, teachings, and, fictional, tales, remained, popular, in, the, new, kingdom, although, the, genre, of, prophetic, texts, was, not, revived, until, the, ptolemaic, period, 4th, century, bc, to, 1st, century, bc, popular, tales, included, the, story, of, sinuhe, and, the, eloquent, peasant, while, important, teaching, texts, include, the, instructions, of, amenemhat, and, the, loyalist, teaching, by, the, new, kingdom, period, the, writing, of, commemorative, graffiti, on, sacred, temple, and, tomb, walls, flourished, as, a, unique, genre, of, literature, yet, it, employed, formulaic, phrases, similar, to, other, genres, the, acknowledgment, of, rightful, authorship, remained, important, only, in, a, few, genres, while, texts, of, the, teaching, genre, were, pseudonymous, and, falsely, attributed, to, prominent, historical, figures, ancient, egyptian, literature, has, been, preserved, on, a, wide, variety, of, media, this, includes, papyrus, scrolls, and, packets, limestone, or, ceramic, ostraca, wooden, writing, boards, monumental, stone, edifices, and, coffins, texts, preserved, and, unearthed, by, modern, archaeologists, represent, a, small, fraction, of, ancient, egyptian, literary, material, the, area, of, the, floodplain, of, the, nile, is, under, represented, because, the, moist, environment, is, unsuitable, for, the, preservation, of, papyri, and, ink, inscriptions, on, the, other, hand, hidden, caches, of, literature, buried, for, thousands, of, years, have, been, discovered, in, settlements, on, the, dry, desert, margins, of, egyptian, civilization, by, the, early, dynastic, period, in, the, late, 4th, millennium, bc, egyptian, hieroglyphs, and, their, cursive, form, hieratic, were, well, established, written, scripts, egyptian, hieroglyphs, are, small, artistic, pictures, of, natural, objects, for, example, the, hieroglyph, for, door, bolt, pronounced, se, produced, the, s, sound, combined, with, another, or, multiple, hieroglyphs, one, could, thus, spell, out, the, sound, of, words, for, more, abstract, concepts, like, sorrow, happiness, beauty, and, evil, the, narmer, palette, dated, c, 3100, bc, during, the, last, phase, of, predynastic, egypt, combines, the, hieroglyphs, for, catfish, and, chisel, to, produce, the, name, of, king, narmer, the, egyptians, called, their, hieroglyphs, words, of, god, and, reserved, their, use, for, exalted, purposes, such, as, communicating, with, divinities, and, spirits, of, the, dead, through, funerary, texts, each, hieroglyphic, word, represented, both, a, specific, object, and, embodied, the, essence, of, that, object, recognizing, it, as, divinely, made, and, belonging, within, the, greater, cosmos, through, acts, of, priestly, ritual, like, burning, incense, the, priest, allowed, spirits, and, deities, to, read, the, hieroglyphs, decorating, the, surfaces, of, temples, in, funerary, texts, beginning, in, and, following, the, twelfth, dynasty, the, egyptians, believed, that, disfiguring, and, even, omitting, certain, hieroglyphs, brought, consequences, either, good, or, bad, for, a, deceased, tomb, occupant, whose, spirit, relied, on, the, texts, as, a, source, of, nourishment, in, the, afterlife, mutilating, the, hieroglyph, of, a, venomous, snake, or, other, dangerous, animal, removed, a, potential, threat, however, removing, every, instance, of, the, hieroglyphs, representing, a, deceased, person, s, name, would, deprive, his, or, her, soul, of, the, ability, to, read, the, funerary, texts, and, condemn, that, soul, to, an, inanimate, existence, hieratic, is, a, simplified, cursive, form, of, egyptian, hieroglyphs, like, hieroglyphs, hieratic, was, used, in, sacred, and, religious, texts, by, the, 1st, millennium, bc, calligraphic, hieratic, became, the, script, predominantly, used, in, funerary, papyri, and, temple, rolls, whereas, the, writing, of, hieroglyphs, required, the, utmost, precision, and, care, cursive, hieratic, could, be, written, much, more, quickly, and, was, therefore, more, practical, for, scribal, record, keeping, its, primary, purpose, was, to, serve, as, a, shorthand, script, for, non, royal, non, monumental, and, less, formal, writings, such, as, private, letters, legal, documents, poems, tax, records, medical, texts, mathematical, treatises, and, instructional, guides, hieratic, could, be, written, in, two, different, styles, one, was, more, calligraphic, and, usually, reserved, for, government, records, and, literary, manuscripts, the, other, was, used, for, informal, accounts, and, letters, by, the, mid, 1st, millennium, bc, hieroglyphs, and, hieratic, were, still, used, for, royal, monumental, religious, and, funerary, writings, while, a, new, even, more, cursive, script, was, used, for, informal, day, to, day, writing, demotic, the, final, script, adopted, by, the, ancient, egyptians, was, the, coptic, alphabet, a, revised, version, of, the, greek, alphabet, coptic, became, the, standard, in, the, 4th, century, ad, when, christianity, became, the, state, religion, throughout, the, roman, empire, hieroglyphs, were, discarded, as, idolatrous, images, of, a, pagan, tradition, unfit, for, writing, the, biblical, canon, egyptian, literature, was, produced, on, a, variety, of, media, along, with, the, chisel, necessary, for, making, inscriptions, on, stone, the, chief, writing, tool, of, ancient, egypt, was, the, reed, pen, a, reed, fashioned, into, a, stem, with, a, bruised, brush, like, end, with, pigments, of, carbon, black, and, red, ochre, the, reed, pen, was, used, to, write, on, scrolls, of, papyrus, a, thin, material, made, from, beating, together, strips, of, pith, from, the, cyperus, papyrus, plant, as, well, as, on, small, ceramic, or, limestone, potsherds, known, as, ostraca, it, is, thought, that, papyrus, rolls, were, moderately, expensive, commercial, items, since, many, are, palimpsests, manuscripts, that, have, had, their, original, contents, erased, or, scraped, off, to, make, room, for, new, written, works, this, along, with, the, practice, of, tearing, pieces, off, of, larger, papyrus, documents, to, make, smaller, letters, suggests, that, there, were, seasonal, shortages, caused, by, the, limited, growing, season, of, cyperus, papyrus, it, also, explains, the, frequent, use, of, ostraca, and, limestone, flakes, as, writing, media, for, shorter, written, works, in, addition, to, stone, ceramic, ostraca, and, papyrus, writing, media, also, included, wood, ivory, and, plaster, by, the, roman, period, of, egypt, the, traditional, egyptian, reed, pen, had, been, replaced, by, the, chief, writing, tool, of, the, greco, roman, world, a, shorter, thicker, reed, pen, with, a, cut, nib, likewise, the, original, egyptian, pigments, were, discarded, in, favor, of, greek, lead, based, inks, the, adoption, of, greco, roman, writing, tools, influenced, egyptian, handwriting, as, hieratic, signs, became, more, spaced, had, rounder, flourishes, and, greater, angular, precision, underground, egyptian, tombs, built, in, the, desert, provide, possibly, the, most, protective, environment, for, the, preservation, of, papyrus, documents, for, example, there, are, many, well, preserved, book, of, the, dead, funerary, papyri, placed, in, tombs, to, act, as, afterlife, guides, for, the, souls, of, the, deceased, tomb, occupants, however, it, was, only, customary, during, the, late, middle, kingdom, and, first, half, of, the, new, kingdom, to, place, non, religious, papyri, in, burial, chambers, thus, the, majority, of, well, preserved, literary, papyri, are, dated, to, this, period, most, settlements, in, ancient, egypt, were, situated, on, the, alluvium, of, the, nile, floodplain, this, moist, environment, was, unfavorable, for, long, term, preservation, of, papyrus, documents, archaeologists, have, discovered, a, larger, quantity, of, papyrus, documents, in, desert, settlements, on, land, elevated, above, the, floodplain, and, in, settlements, that, lacked, irrigation, works, such, as, elephantine, el, lahun, and, el, hiba, writings, on, more, permanent, media, have, also, been, lost, in, several, ways, stones, with, inscriptions, were, frequently, re, used, as, building, materials, and, ceramic, ostraca, require, a, dry, environment, to, ensure, the, preservation, of, the, ink, on, their, surfaces, whereas, papyrus, rolls, and, packets, were, usually, stored, in, boxes, for, safekeeping, ostraca, were, routinely, discarded, in, waste, pits, one, such, pit, was, discovered, by, chance, at, the, ramesside, era, village, of, deir, el, medina, and, has, yielded, the, majority, of, known, private, letters, on, ostraca, documents, found, at, this, site, include, letters, hymns, fictional, narratives, recipes, business, receipts, and, wills, and, testaments, penelope, wilson, describes, this, archaeological, find, as, the, equivalent, of, sifting, through, a, modern, landfill, or, waste, container, she, notes, that, the, inhabitants, of, deir, el, medina, were, incredibly, literate, by, ancient, egyptian, standards, and, cautions, that, such, finds, only, come, in, rarefied, circumstances, and, in, particular, conditions, john, w, tait, stresses, egyptian, material, survives, in, a, very, uneven, fashion, the, unevenness, of, survival, comprises, both, time, and, space, for, instance, there, is, a, dearth, of, written, material, from, all, periods, from, the, nile, delta, but, an, abundance, at, western, thebes, dating, from, its, heyday, he, notes, that, while, some, texts, were, copied, numerous, times, others, survive, from, a, single, copy, for, example, there, is, only, one, complete, surviving, copy, of, the, tale, of, the, shipwrecked, sailor, from, the, middle, kingdom, however, tale, of, the, shipwrecked, sailor, also, appears, in, fragments, of, texts, on, ostraca, from, the, new, kingdom, many, other, literary, works, survive, only, in, fragments, or, through, incomplete, copies, of, lost, originals, although, writing, first, appeared, during, the, very, late, 4th, millennium, bc, it, was, only, used, to, convey, short, names, and, labels, connected, strings, of, text, did, not, appear, until, about, 2600, bc, at, the, beginning, of, the, old, kingdom, this, development, marked, the, beginning, of, the, first, known, phase, of, the, egyptian, language, old, egyptian, old, egyptian, remained, a, spoken, language, until, about, 2100, bc, when, during, the, beginning, of, the, middle, kingdom, it, evolved, into, middle, egyptian, while, middle, egyptian, was, closely, related, to, old, egyptian, late, egyptian, was, significantly, different, in, grammatical, structure, late, egyptian, possibly, appeared, as, a, vernacular, language, as, early, as, 1600, bc, but, was, not, used, as, a, written, language, until, c, 1300, bc, during, the, amarna, period, of, the, new, kingdom, late, egyptian, evolved, into, demotic, by, the, 7th, century, bc, and, although, demotic, remained, a, spoken, language, until, the, 5th, century, ad, it, was, gradually, evolved, into, coptic, beginning, in, the, 1st, century, ad, hieratic, was, used, alongside, hieroglyphs, for, writing, in, old, and, middle, egyptian, becoming, the, dominant, form, of, writing, in, late, egyptian, by, the, new, kingdom, and, throughout, the, rest, of, ancient, egyptian, history, middle, egyptian, became, a, classical, language, that, was, usually, reserved, for, reading, and, writing, in, hieroglyphs, and, the, spoken, language, for, more, exalted, forms, of, literature, such, as, historical, records, commemorative, autobiographies, hymns, and, funerary, spells, however, middle, kingdom, literature, written, in, middle, egyptian, was, also, rewritten, in, hieratic, during, later, periods, throughout, ancient, egyptian, history, the, ability, to, read, and, write, were, the, main, requirements, for, serving, in, public, office, although, government, officials, were, assisted, in, their, day, to, day, work, by, an, elite, literate, social, group, known, as, scribes, as, evidenced, by, papyrus, anastasi, i, of, the, ramesside, period, scribes, could, even, be, expected, according, to, wilson, to, organize, the, excavation, of, a, lake, and, the, building, of, a, brick, ramp, to, establish, the, number, of, men, needed, to, transport, an, obelisk, and, to, arrange, the, provisioning, of, a, military, mission, besides, government, employment, scribal, services, in, drafting, letters, sales, documents, and, legal, documents, would, have, been, frequently, sought, by, illiterate, people, prevalence, and, percentage, of, literacy, in, egyptian, society, remains, difficult, to, determine, literate, people, are, thought, to, have, comprised, 1, 15, of, the, population, based, on, very, limited, evidence, the, percentage, varied, by, period, and, region, the, remainder, being, illiterate, farmers, herdsmen, artisans, and, other, laborers, as, well, as, merchants, who, required, the, assistance, of, scribal, secretaries, the, privileged, status, of, the, scribe, over, illiterate, manual, laborers, was, the, subject, of, a, popular, ramesside, period, instructional, text, the, satire, of, the, trades, where, lowly, undesirable, occupations, for, example, potter, fisherman, laundry, man, and, soldier, were, mocked, and, the, scribal, profession, praised, a, similar, demeaning, attitude, towards, the, illiterate, is, expressed, in, the, middle, kingdom, teaching, of, khety, which, is, used, to, reinforce, the, scribes, elevated, position, within, the, social, hierarchy, the, scribal, class, was, the, social, group, responsible, for, maintaining, transmitting, and, canonizing, literary, classics, and, writing, new, compositions, classic, works, such, as, the, story, of, sinuhe, and, instructions, of, amenemhat, were, copied, by, schoolboys, as, pedagogical, exercises, in, writing, and, to, instill, the, required, ethical, and, moral, values, that, distinguished, the, scribal, social, class, wisdom, texts, of, the, teaching, genre, represent, the, majority, of, pedagogical, texts, written, on, ostraca, during, the, middle, kingdom, narrative, tales, such, as, sinuhe, and, king, neferkare, and, general, sasenet, were, rarely, copied, for, school, exercises, until, the, new, kingdom, william, kelly, simpson, describes, narrative, tales, such, as, sinuhe, and, the, shipwrecked, sailor, as, instructions, or, teachings, in, the, guise, of, narratives, since, the, main, protagonists, of, such, stories, embodied, the, accepted, virtues, of, the, day, such, as, love, of, home, or, self, reliance, there, are, some, known, instances, where, those, outside, the, scribal, profession, were, literate, and, had, access, to, classical, literature, menena, a, draughtsman, working, at, deir, el, medina, during, the, twentieth, dynasty, of, egypt, quoted, passages, from, the, middle, kingdom, narratives, eloquent, peasant, and, tale, of, the, shipwrecked, sailor, in, an, instructional, letter, reprimanding, his, disobedient, son, menena, s, ramesside, contemporary, hori, the, scribal, author, of, the, satirical, letter, in, papyrus, anastasi, i, admonished, his, addressee, for, quoting, the, instruction, of, hardjedef, in, the, unbecoming, manner, of, a, non, scribal, semi, educated, person, hans, werner, fischer, elfert, further, explains, this, perceived, amateur, affront, to, orthodox, literature, what, may, be, revealed, by, hori, s, attack, on, the, way, in, which, some, ramesside, scribes, felt, obliged, to, demonstrate, their, greater, or, lesser, acquaintance, with, ancient, literature, is, the, conception, that, these, venerable, works, were, meant, to, be, known, in, full, and, not, to, be, misused, as, quarries, for, popular, sayings, mined, deliberately, from, the, past, the, classics, of, the, time, were, to, be, memorized, completely, and, comprehended, thoroughly, before, being, cited, there, is, limited, but, solid, evidence, in, egyptian, literature, and, art, for, the, practice, of, oral, reading, of, texts, to, audiences, the, oral, performance, word, to, recite, dj, was, usually, associated, with, biographies, letters, and, spells, singing, sj, was, meant, for, praise, songs, love, songs, funerary, laments, and, certain, spells, discourses, such, as, the, prophecy, of, neferti, suggest, that, compositions, were, meant, for, oral, reading, among, elite, gatherings, in, the, 1st, millennium, bc, demotic, short, story, cycle, centered, on, the, deeds, of, petiese, the, stories, begin, with, the, phrase, the, voice, which, is, before, pharaoh, which, indicates, that, an, oral, speaker, and, audience, was, involved, in, the, reading, of, the, text, a, fictional, audience, of, high, government, officials, and, members, of, the, royal, court, are, mentioned, in, some, texts, but, a, wider, non, literate, audience, may, have, been, involved, for, example, a, funerary, stela, of, senusret, i, r, 1971, 1926, bc, explicitly, mentions, people, who, will, gather, and, listen, to, a, scribe, who, recites, the, stela, inscriptions, out, loud, literature, also, served, religious, purposes, beginning, with, the, pyramid, texts, of, the, old, kingdom, works, of, funerary, literature, written, on, tomb, walls, and, later, on, coffins, and, papyri, placed, within, tombs, were, designed, to, protect, and, nurture, souls, in, their, afterlife, this, included, the, use, of, magical, spells, incantations, and, lyrical, hymns, copies, of, non, funerary, literary, texts, found, in, non, royal, tombs, suggest, that, the, dead, could, entertain, themselves, in, the, afterlife, by, reading, these, teaching, texts, and, narrative, tales, although, the, creation, of, literature, was, predominantly, a, male, scribal, pursuit, some, works, are, thought, to, have, been, written, by, women, for, example, several, references, to, women, writing, letters, and, surviving, private, letters, sent, and, received, by, women, have, been, found, however, edward, f, wente, asserts, that, even, with, explicit, references, to, women, reading, letters, it, is, possible, that, women, employed, others, to, write, documents, richard, b, parkinson, and, ludwig, d, morenz, write, that, ancient, egyptian, literature, narrowly, defined, as, belles, lettres, beautiful, writing, was, not, recorded, in, written, form, until, the, early, twelfth, dynasty, of, the, middle, kingdom, old, kingdom, texts, served, mainly, to, maintain, the, divine, cults, preserve, souls, in, the, afterlife, and, document, accounts, for, practical, uses, in, daily, life, it, was, not, until, the, middle, kingdom, that, texts, were, written, for, the, purpose, of, entertainment, and, intellectual, curiosity, parkinson, and, morenz, also, speculate, that, written, works, of, the, middle, kingdom, were, transcriptions, of, the, oral, literature, of, the, old, kingdom, it, is, known, that, some, oral, poetry, was, preserved, in, later, writing, for, example, litter, bearers, songs, were, preserved, as, written, verses, in, tomb, inscriptions, of, the, old, kingdom, dating, texts, by, methods, of, palaeography, the, study, of, handwriting, is, problematic, because, of, differing, styles, of, hieratic, script, the, use, of, orthography, the, study, of, writing, systems, and, symbol, usage, is, also, problematic, since, some, texts, authors, may, have, copied, the, characteristic, style, of, an, older, archetype, fictional, accounts, were, often, set, in, remote, historical, settings, the, use, of, contemporary, settings, in, fiction, being, a, relatively, recent, phenomenon, the, style, of, a, text, provides, little, help, in, determining, an, exact, date, for, its, composition, as, genre, and, authorial, choice, might, be, more, concerned, with, the, mood, of, a, text, than, the, era, in, which, it, was, written, for, example, authors, of, the, middle, kingdom, could, set, fictional, wisdom, texts, in, the, golden, age, of, the, old, kingdom, e, g, kagemni, ptahhotep, and, the, prologue, of, neferti, or, they, could, write, fictional, accounts, placed, in, a, chaotic, age, resembling, more, the, problematic, life, of, the, first, intermediate, period, e, g, merykare, and, the, eloquent, peasant, other, fictional, texts, are, set, in, illo, tempore, in, an, indeterminable, era, and, usually, contain, timeless, themes, parkinson, writes, that, nearly, all, literary, texts, were, pseudonymous, and, frequently, falsely, attributed, to, well, known, male, protagonists, of, earlier, history, such, as, kings, and, viziers, only, the, literary, genres, of, teaching, and, laments, discourses, contain, works, attributed, to, historical, authors, texts, in, genres, such, as, narrative, tales, were, never, attributed, to, a, well, known, historical, person, tait, asserts, that, during, the, classical, period, of, egypt, egyptian, scribes, constructed, their, own, view, of, the, history, of, the, role, of, scribes, and, of, the, authorship, of, texts, but, during, the, late, period, this, role, was, instead, maintained, by, the, religious, elite, attached, to, the, temples, there, are, a, few, exceptions, to, the, rule, of, pseudonymity, the, real, authors, of, some, ramesside, period, teaching, texts, were, acknowledged, but, these, cases, are, rare, localized, and, do, not, typify, mainstream, works, those, who, wrote, private, and, sometimes, model, letters, were, acknowledged, as, the, original, authors, private, letters, could, be, used, in, courts, of, law, as, testimony, since, a, person, s, unique, handwriting, could, be, identified, as, authentic, private, letters, received, or, written, by, the, pharaoh, were, sometimes, inscribed, in, hieroglyphics, on, stone, monuments, to, celebrate, kingship, while, kings, decrees, inscribed, on, stone, stelas, were, often, made, public, modern, egyptologists, categorize, egyptian, texts, into, genres, for, example, laments, discourses, and, narrative, tales, the, only, genre, of, literature, named, as, such, by, the, ancient, egyptians, was, the, teaching, or, sebayt, genre, parkinson, states, that, the, titles, of, a, work, its, opening, statement, or, key, words, found, in, the, body, of, text, should, be, used, as, indicators, of, its, particular, genre, only, the, genre, of, narrative, tales, employed, prose, yet, many, of, the, works, of, that, genre, as, well, as, those, of, other, genres, were, written, in, verse, most, ancient, egyptian, verses, were, written, in, couplet, form, but, sometimes, triplets, and, quatrains, were, used, the, instructions, or, teaching, genre, as, well, as, the, genre, of, reflective, discourses, can, be, grouped, in, the, larger, corpus, of, wisdom, literature, found, in, the, ancient, near, east, the, genre, is, didactic, in, nature, and, is, thought, to, have, formed, part, of, the, middle, kingdom, scribal, education, syllabus, however, teaching, texts, often, incorporate, narrative, elements, that, can, instruct, as, well, as, entertain, parkinson, asserts, that, there, is, evidence, that, teaching, texts, were, not, created, primarily, for, use, in, scribal, education, but, for, ideological, purposes, for, example, adolf, erman, 1854, 1937, writes, that, the, fictional, instruction, given, by, amenemhat, i, r, 1991, 1962, bc, to, his, sons, far, exceeds, the, bounds, of, school, philosophy, and, there, is, nothing, whatever, to, do, with, school, in, a, great, warning, his, children, to, be, loyal, to, the, king, while, narrative, literature, embodied, in, works, such, as, the, eloquent, peasant, emphasize, the, individual, hero, who, challenges, society, and, its, accepted, ideologies, the, teaching, texts, instead, stress, the, need, to, comply, with, society, s, accepted, dogmas, key, words, found, in, teaching, texts, include, to, know, r, and, to, teach, sb, these, texts, usually, adopt, the, formulaic, title, structure, of, the, instruction, of, x, made, for, y, where, x, can, be, represented, by, an, authoritative, figure, such, as, a, vizier, or, king, providing, moral, guidance, to, his, son, s, it, is, sometimes, difficult, to, determine, how, many, fictional, addressees, are, involved, in, these, teachings, since, some, texts, switch, between, singular, and, plural, when, referring, to, their, audiences, examples, of, the, teaching, genre, include, the, maxims, of, ptahhotep, instructions, of, kagemni, teaching, for, king, merykare, instructions, of, amenemhat, instruction, of, hardjedef, loyalist, teaching, and, instructions, of, amenemope, teaching, texts, that, have,

for, an, army, and, the, geography, of, western, asia, moreover, wente, calls, this, a, polemical, tractate, that, counsels, against, the, rote, mechanical, learning, of, terms, for, places, professions, and, things, for, example, it, is, not, acceptable, to, know, just, the, place, names, of, western, asia, but, also, important, details, about, its, topography, and, routes, to, enhance, the, teaching, the, text, employs, sarcasm, and, irony, catherine, parke, professor, emerita, of, english, and, women, s, studies, at, the, university, of, missouri, in, columbia, missouri, writes, that, the, earliest, commemorative, inscriptions, belong, to, ancient, egypt, and, date, to, the, 3rd, millennium, bc, she, writes, in, ancient, egypt, the, formulaic, accounts, of, pharaoh, s, lives, praised, the, continuity, of, dynastic, power, although, typically, written, in, the, first, person, these, pronouncements, are, public, general, testimonials, not, personal, utterances, she, adds, that, as, in, these, ancient, inscriptions, the, human, urge, to, celebrate, commemorate, and, immortalize, the, impulse, of, life, against, death, is, the, aim, of, biographies, written, today, olivier, perdu, a, professor, of, egyptology, at, the, coll, ge, de, france, states, that, biographies, did, not, exist, in, ancient, egypt, and, that, commemorative, writing, should, be, considered, autobiographical, edward, l, greenstein, professor, of, bible, at, the, tel, aviv, university, and, bar, ilan, university, disagrees, with, perdu, s, terminology, stating, that, the, ancient, world, produced, no, autobiographies, in, the, modern, sense, and, these, should, be, distinguished, from, autobiographical, texts, of, the, ancient, world, however, both, perdu, and, greenstein, assert, that, autobiographies, of, the, ancient, near, east, should, not, be, equated, with, the, modern, concept, of, autobiography, in, her, discussion, of, the, ecclesiastes, of, the, hebrew, bible, jennifer, koosed, associate, professor, of, religion, at, albright, college, explains, that, there, is, no, solid, consensus, among, scholars, as, to, whether, true, biographies, or, autobiographies, existed, in, the, ancient, world, one, of, the, major, scholarly, arguments, against, this, theory, is, that, the, concept, of, individuality, did, not, exist, until, the, european, renaissance, prompting, koosed, to, write, thus, autobiography, is, made, a, product, of, european, civilization, augustine, begat, rosseau, begat, henry, adams, and, so, on, koosed, asserts, that, the, use, of, first, person, i, in, ancient, egyptian, commemorative, funerary, texts, should, not, be, taken, literally, since, the, supposed, author, is, already, dead, funerary, texts, should, be, considered, biographical, instead, of, autobiographical, koosed, cautions, that, the, term, biography, applied, to, such, texts, is, problematic, since, they, also, usually, describe, the, deceased, person, s, experiences, of, journeying, through, the, afterlife, beginning, with, the, funerary, stelas, for, officials, of, the, late, third, dynasty, small, amounts, of, biographical, detail, were, added, next, to, the, deceased, men, s, titles, however, it, was, not, until, the, sixth, dynasty, that, narratives, of, the, lives, and, careers, of, government, officials, were, inscribed, tomb, biographies, became, more, detailed, during, the, middle, kingdom, and, included, information, about, the, deceased, person, s, family, the, vast, majority, of, autobiographical, texts, are, dedicated, to, scribal, bureaucrats, but, during, the, new, kingdom, some, were, dedicated, to, military, officers, and, soldiers, autobiographical, texts, of, the, late, period, place, a, greater, stress, upon, seeking, help, from, deities, than, acting, righteously, to, succeed, in, life, whereas, earlier, autobiographical, texts, exclusively, dealt, with, celebrating, successful, lives, late, period, autobiographical, texts, include, laments, for, premature, death, similar, to, the, epitaphs, of, ancient, greece, modern, historians, consider, that, some, biographical, or, autobiographical, texts, are, important, historical, documents, for, example, the, biographical, stelas, of, military, generals, in, tomb, chapels, built, under, thutmose, iii, provide, much, of, the, information, known, about, the, wars, in, syria, and, canaan, however, the, annals, of, thutmose, iii, carved, into, the, walls, of, several, monuments, built, during, his, reign, such, as, those, at, karnak, also, preserve, information, about, these, campaigns, the, annals, of, ramesses, ii, r, 1279, 1213, bc, recounting, the, battle, of, kadesh, against, the, hittites, include, for, the, first, time, in, egyptian, literature, a, narrative, epic, poem, distinguished, from, all, earlier, poetry, that, served, to, celebrate, and, instruct, other, documents, useful, for, investigating, egyptian, history, are, ancient, lists, of, kings, found, in, terse, chronicles, such, as, the, fifth, dynasty, palermo, stone, these, documents, legitimated, the, contemporary, pharaoh, s, claim, to, sovereignty, throughout, ancient, egyptian, history, royal, decrees, recounted, the, deeds, of, ruling, pharaohs, for, example, the, nubian, pharaoh, piye, r, 752, 721, bc, founder, of, the, twenty, fifth, dynasty, had, a, stela, erected, and, written, in, classical, middle, egyptian, that, describes, with, unusual, nuances, and, vivid, imagery, his, successful, military, campaigns, an, egyptian, historian, known, by, his, greek, name, as, manetho, c, 3rd, century, bc, was, the, first, to, compile, a, comprehensive, history, of, egypt, manetho, was, active, during, the, reign, of, ptolemy, ii, r, 283, 246, bc, and, used, the, histories, by, the, greek, herodotus, c, 484, bc, c, 425, bc, as, his, main, source, of, inspiration, for, a, history, of, egypt, written, in, greek, however, the, primary, sources, for, manetho, s, work, were, the, king, list, chronicles, of, previous, egyptian, dynasties, fischer, elfert, distinguishes, ancient, egyptian, graffiti, writing, as, a, literary, genre, during, the, new, kingdom, scribes, who, traveled, to, ancient, sites, often, left, graffiti, messages, on, the, walls, of, sacred, mortuary, temples, and, pyramids, usually, in, commemoration, of, these, structures, modern, scholars, do, not, consider, these, scribes, to, have, been, mere, tourists, but, pilgrims, visiting, sacred, sites, where, the, extinct, cult, centers, could, be, used, for, communicating, with, the, gods, there, is, evidence, from, an, educational, ostracon, found, in, the, tomb, of, senenmut, tt71, that, formulaic, graffiti, writing, was, practiced, in, scribal, schools, in, one, graffiti, message, left, at, the, mortuary, temple, of, thutmose, iii, at, deir, el, bahri, a, modified, saying, from, the, maxims, of, ptahhotep, is, incorporated, into, a, prayer, written, on, the, temple, wall, scribes, usually, wrote, their, graffiti, in, separate, clusters, to, distinguish, their, graffiti, from, others, this, led, to, competition, among, scribes, who, would, sometimes, denigrate, the, quality, of, graffiti, inscribed, by, others, even, ancestors, from, the, scribal, profession, after, the, copts, converted, to, christianity, in, the, first, centuries, ad, their, coptic, literature, became, separated, from, the, pharaonic, and, hellenistic, literary, traditions, nevertheless, scholars, speculate, that, ancient, egyptian, literature, perhaps, in, oral, form, influenced, greek, and, arabic, literature, parallels, are, drawn, between, the, egyptian, soldiers, sneaking, into, jaffa, hidden, in, baskets, to, capture, the, city, in, the, story, the, taking, of, joppa, and, the, mycenaean, greeks, sneaking, into, troy, inside, the, trojan, horse, the, taking, of, joppa, has, also, been, compared, to, the, arabic, story, of, ali, baba, in, one, thousand, and, one, nights, it, has, been, conjectured, that, sinbad, the, sailor, may, have, been, inspired, by, the, pharaonic, tale, of, the, shipwrecked, sailor, some, egyptian, literature, was, commented, on, by, scholars, of, the, ancient, world, for, example, the, jewish, roman, historian, josephus, 37, c, 100, ad, quoted, and, provided, commentary, on, manetho, s, historical, texts, the, most, recently, carved, hieroglyphic, inscription, of, ancient, egypt, known, today, is, found, in, a, temple, of, philae, dated, precisely, to, 394, ad, during, the, reign, of, theodosius, i, r, 379, 395, ad, in, the, 4th, century, ad, the, hellenized, egyptian, horapollo, compiled, a, survey, of, almost, two, hundred, egyptian, hieroglyphs, and, provided, his, interpretation, of, their, meanings, although, his, understanding, was, limited, and, he, was, unaware, of, the, phonetic, uses, of, each, hieroglyph, this, survey, was, apparently, lost, until, 1415, when, the, italian, cristoforo, buondelmonti, acquired, it, at, the, island, of, andros, athanasius, kircher, 1601, 1680, was, the, first, in, europe, to, realize, that, coptic, was, a, direct, linguistic, descendant, of, ancient, egyptian, in, his, oedipus, aegyptiacus, he, made, the, first, concerted, european, effort, to, interpret, the, meaning, of, egyptian, hieroglyphs, albeit, based, on, symbolic, inferences, it, was, not, until, 1799, with, the, napoleonic, discovery, of, a, trilingual, i, e, hieroglyphic, demotic, greek, stela, inscription, on, the, rosetta, stone, that, modern, scholars, had, the, resources, to, decipher, egyptian, texts, the, key, breakthroughs, were, made, more, than, twenty, years, later, in, the, work, of, jean, fran, ois, champollion, in, deciphering, hieroglyphs, and, thomas, young, in, deciphering, demotic, by, the, time, of, champollion, s, death, in, 1832, it, was, possible, to, discern, the, general, sense, of, egyptian, texts, the, first, scholar, able, to, read, an, egyptian, text, in, full, was, emmanuel, de, roug, who, published, the, first, translations, of, egyptian, literary, texts, in, 1856, before, the, 1970s, scholarly, consensus, was, that, ancient, egyptian, literature, although, sharing, similarities, with, modern, literary, categories, was, not, an, independent, discourse, uninfluenced, by, the, ancient, sociopolitical, order, however, from, the, 1970s, onwards, a, growing, number, of, historians, and, literary, scholars, have, questioned, this, theory, while, scholars, before, the, 1970s, treated, ancient, egyptian, literary, works, as, viable, historical, sources, that, accurately, reflected, the, conditions, of, this, ancient, society, scholars, now, caution, against, this, approach, scholars, are, increasingly, using, a, multifaceted, hermeneutic, approach, to, the, study, of, individual, literary, works, in, which, not, only, the, style, and, content, but, also, the, cultural, social, and, historical, context, of, the, work, are, taken, into, account, individual, works, can, then, be, used, as, case, studies, for, reconstructing, the, main, features, of, ancient, egyptian, literary, discourse
