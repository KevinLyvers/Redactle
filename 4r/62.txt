first, decade, of, motion, pictures, the, demand, for, movies, the, amount, of, new, productions, and, the, average, runtime, of, movies, kept, increasing, and, at, some, stage, it, was, viable, to, have, theaters, that, would, no, longer, program, live, acts, but, only, movies, the, first, building, built, for, the, dedicated, purpose, of, showing, motion, pictures, was, built, to, demonstrate, the, phantoscope, a, device, created, by, jenkins, armat, as, part, of, the, cotton, state, exposition, on, september, 25, 1895, in, atlanta, ga, this, is, arguably, the, first, cinema, in, the, world, claimants, for, the, title, of, the, earliest, movie, theatre, include, the, eden, theater, in, la, ciotat, where, l, arriv, e, d, un, train, en, gare, de, la, ciotat, was, screened, on, 21,

in, front, of, the, stage, and, adding, a, projector, this, conversion, may, be, permanent, or, temporary, for, purposes, such, as, showing, arthouse, fare, to, an, audience, accustomed, to, plays, the, familiar, characteristics, of, relatively, low, admission, and, open, seating, can, be, traced, to, samuel, roxy, rothafel, an, early, movie, theater, impresario, many, of, these, early, theaters, contain, a, balcony, an, elevated, level, across, the, auditorium, above, the, theater, s, rearmost, seats, the, rearward, main, floor, loge, seats, were, sometimes, larger, softer, and, more, widely, spaced, and, sold, for, a, higher, price, in, conventional, low, pitch, viewing, floors, the, preferred, seating, arrangement, is, to, use, staggered, rows, while, a, less, efficient, use, of, floor, space, this, allows, a, somewhat, improved, sight, line, between, the, patrons, seated, in, the, next, row, toward, the, screen, provided, they, do, not, lean, toward, one, another, stadium, seating, popular, in, modern, multiplexes, actually, dates, back, to, the, 1920s, the, 1922, princess, theatre, in, honolulu, hawaii, featured, stadium, seating, sharply, raked, rows, of, seats, extending, from, in, front, of, the, screen, back, towards, the, ceiling, it, gives, patrons, a, clear, sight, line, over, the, heads, of, those, seated, in, front, of, them, modern, stadium, seating, was, utilized, in, imax, theaters, which, have, very, tall, screens, beginning, in, the, early, 1970s, rows, of, seats, are, divided, by, one, or, more, aisles, so, that, there, are, seldom, more, than, 20, seats, in, a, row, this, allows, easier, access, to, seating, as, the, space, between, rows, is, very, narrow, depending, on, the, angle, of, rake, of, the, seats, the, aisles, have, steps, in, older, theaters, aisle, lights, were, often, built, into, the, end, seats, of, each, row, to, help, patrons, find, their, way, in, the, dark, since, the, advent, of, stadium, theaters, with, stepped, aisles, each, step, in, the, aisles, may, be, outlined, with, small, lights, to, prevent, patrons, from, tripping, in, the, darkened, theater, in, movie, theaters, the, auditorium, may, also, have, lights, that, go, to, a, low, level, when, the, movie, is, going, to, begin, theaters, often, have, booster, seats, for, children, and, other, people, of, short, stature, to, place, on, the, seats, to, allow, them, to, sit, higher, for, a, better, view, many, modern, theaters, have, accessible, seating, areas, for, patrons, in, wheelchairs, see, also, luxury, screens, below, canada, was, the, first, country, in, the, world, to, have, a, two, screen, theater, the, elgin, theatre, in, ottawa, ontario, became, the, first, venue, to, offer, two, film, programs, on, different, screens, in, 1957, when, canadian, theater, owner, nat, taylor, converted, the, dual, screen, theater, into, one, capable, of, showing, two, different, movies, simultaneously, taylor, is, credited, by, canadian, sources, as, the, inventor, of, the, multiplex, or, cineplex, he, later, founded, the, cineplex, odeon, corporation, opening, the, 18, screen, toronto, eaton, centre, cineplex, the, world, s, largest, at, the, time, in, toronto, ontario, in, the, united, states, stanley, durwood, of, american, multi, cinema, now, amc, theatres, is, credited, as, pioneering, the, multiplex, in, 1963, after, realizing, that, he, could, operate, several, attached, auditoriums, with, the, same, staff, needed, for, one, through, careful, management, of, the, start, times, for, each, movie, ward,

venues, have, been, retrofitted, so, that, they, have, multiple, auditoriums, a, single, foyer, area, is, shared, among, them, in, the, 1970s, many, large, 1920s, movie, palaces, were, converted, into, multiple, screen, venues, by, dividing, their, large, auditoriums, and, sometimes, even, the, stage, space, into, smaller, theaters, because, of, their, size, and, amenities, like, plush, seating, and, extensive, food, beverage, service, multiplexes, and, megaplexes, draw, from, a, larger, geographic, area, than, smaller, theaters, as, a, rule, of, thumb, they, pull, audiences, from, an, eight, to, 12, mile, radius, versus, a, three, to, five, mile, radius, for, smaller, theaters, though, the, size, of, this, radius, depends, on, population, density, as, a, result, the, customer, geography, area, of, multiplexes, and, megaplexes, typically, overlaps, with, smaller, theaters, which, face, threat, of, having, their, audience, siphoned, by, bigger, theaters, that, cut, a, wider, swath, in, the, movie, going, landscape, in, most, markets, nearly, all, single, screen, theaters, sometimes, referred, to, as, a, uniplex, have, gone, out, of, business, the, ones, remaining, are, generally, used, for, arthouse, films, e, g, the, crest, theatre, in, downtown, sacramento, california, small, scale, productions, film, festivals, or, other, presentations, because, of, the, late, development, of, multiplexes, the, term, cinema, or, theater, may, refer, either, to, the, whole, complex, or, a, single, auditorium, and, sometimes, screen, is, used, to, refer, to, an, auditorium, a, popular, film, may, be, shown, on, multiple, screens, at, the, same, multiplex, which, reduces, the, choice, of, other, films, but, offers, more, choice, of, viewing, times, or, a, greater, number, of, seats, to, accommodate, patrons, two, or, three, screens, may, be, created, by, dividing, up, an, existing, cinema, as, durwood, did, with, his, roxy, in, 1964, but, newly, built, multiplexes, usually, have, at, least, six, to, eight, screens, and, often, as, many, as, twelve, fourteen, sixteen, or, even, eighteen, although, definitions, vary, a, large, multiplex, with, 20, or, more, screens, is, usually, called, a, megaplex, however, in, the, united, kingdom, this, was, a, brand, name, for, virgin, cinema, later, ugc, the, first, megaplex, is, generally, considered, to, be, the,

long, films, there, may, also, be, a, break, between, the, introductory, material, and, the, feature, some, countries, such, as, the, netherlands, have, a, tradition, of, incorporating, an, intermission, in, regular, feature, presentations, though, many, theaters, have, now, abandoned, that, tradition, while, in, north, america, this, is, very, rare, and, usually, limited, to, special, circumstances, involving, extremely, long, movies, during, the, closing, credits, many, people, leave, but, some, stay, until, the, end, usually, the, lights, are, switched, on, after, the, credits,

trailers, then, be, fully, drawn, to, reveal, the, full, width, of, the, screen, for, the, main, feature, some, theaters, lacking, a, curtain, filled, the, screen, with, slides, of, some, form, of,

entrance, to, regular, showings, cinemas, in, thailand, have, a, restriction, of, one, viewing, per, movie, the, increasing, number, of, 3d, movies, for, which, an, additional, fee, is, required,

theater, may, either, not, be, allowed, to, program, an, unrated, film, or, voluntarily, refrain, from, that, movie, studios, film, distributors, in, the, us, traditionally, drive, hard, bargains, entitling, them, to, as, much, as, 100, of, the, gross, ticket, revenue, during, the, first, weeks, and, then, the, balance, changes, in, 10, increments, in, favor, of, exhibitors, at, intervals, that, vary, from, film, to, film, film, exhibition, has, seen, a, rise, in, its, development, with, video, consolidation, as, well, as, dvd, sales, which, over, the, past, two, decades, is, the, biggest, earner, in, revenue, according, to, the, contemporary, hollywood, film, industry, philip, drake, states, that, box, office, takings, currently, account, for, less, than, a, quarter, of, total, revenues, and, have, become, increasingly, front, loaded, earning, the, majority, of, receipts, in, the, opening, two, weeks, of, exhibition, meaning, that, films, need, to, make, an, almost, instant, impact, in, order, to, avoid, being, dropped, from, screens, by, exhibitors, essentially, if, the, film, does, not, succeed, in, the, first, few, weeks, of, its, inception, it, will, most, likely, fail, in, its, attempt, to, gain, a, sustainable, amount, of, revenue, and, thus, being, taken, out, from, movie, theaters, furthermore, higher, budget, films, on, the, opening, weekend, or, the, three, days, friday, to, sunday, can, signify, how, much, revenue, it, will, bring, in, not, only, to, america, but, as, well, as, overseas, it, may, also, determine, the, price, in, distribution, windows, through, home, video, and, television, in, canada, the, total, operating, revenue, in, the, movie, theater, industry, was, 1, 7, billion, in, 2012, an, 8, 4, increase, from, 2010, this, increase, was, mainly, the, result, of, growth, in, box, office, and, concession, revenue, combined, these, accounted, for, 91, 9, of, total, industry, operating, revenue, in, the, us, the, number, of, tickets, sold, fell, nearly, 11, between, 2004, and, 2013, according, to, the, report, while, box, office, revenue, increased, 17, due, to, increased, ticket, prices, one, reason, for, the, decline, in, ticket, sales, in, the, 2000s, is, that, home, entertainment, options, improving, all, the, time, whether, streamed, movies, and, television, video, games, or, mobile, apps, and, studios, releasing, fewer, movies, which, means, that, people, are, less, likely, to, head, to, their, local, multiplex, this, decline, is, not, something, that, is, recent, it, has, been, observed, since, the, 1950s, when, television, became, widespread, among, working, class, homes, as, the, years, went, on, home, media, became, more, popular, and, the, decline, continued, this, decline, continues, until, this, day, a, pew, media, survey, from, 2006, found, that, the, relationship, between, movies, watched, at, home, versus, at, the, movie, theater, was, in, a, five, to, one, ratio, and, 75, of, respondents, said, their, preferred, way, of, watching, a, movie, was, at, home, versus, 21, who, said, they, preferred, to, go, to, a, theater, in, 2014, it, was, reported, that, the, practice, of, releasing, a, film, in, theaters, and, via, on, demand, streaming, on, the, same, day, for, selected, films, and, the, rise, in, popularity, of, the, netflix, streaming, service, has, led, to, concerns, in, the, movie, theater, industry, another, source, of, competition, is, television, which, has, stolen, a, lot, of, cinema, s, best, tricks, like, good, production, values, and, top, tier, actors, and, brought, them, into, people, s, living, rooms, since, the, 2010s, one, of, the, increasing, sources, of, competition, for, movie, theaters, is, the, increasing, ownership, by, people, of, home, theater, systems, which, can, display, high, resolution, blu, ray, disks, of, movies, on, large, widescreen, flat, screen, tvs, with, 5, 1, surround, sound, and, a, powerful, subwoofer, for, low, pitched, sounds, the, relatively, strong, uniformity, of, movie, ticket, prices, particularly, in, the, u, s, is, a, common, economics, puzzle, because, conventional, supply, and, demand, theory, would, suggest, higher, prices, for, more, popular, and, more, expensive, movies, and, lower, prices, for, an, unpopular, bomb, or, for, a, documentary, with, less, audience, appeal, unlike, seemingly, similar, forms, of, entertainment, such, as, rock, concerts, in, which, a, popular, performer, s, tickets, cost, much, more, than, an, unpopular, performer, s, tickets, the, demand, for, movies, is, very, difficult, to, predict, ahead, of, time, indeed, some, films, with, major, stars, such, as, gigli, which, starred, the, then, supercouple, of, ben, affleck, and, jennifer, lopez, have, turned, out, to, be, box, office, bombs, while, low, budget, films, with, unknown, actors, have, become, smash, hits, e, g, the, blair, witch, project, the, demand, for, films, is, usually, determined, from, ticket, sale, statistics, after, the, movie, is, already, out, uniform, pricing, is, therefore, a, strategy, to, cope, with, unpredictable, demand, historical, and, cultural, factors, are, sometimes, also, cited, in, some, movie, theater, complexes, the, theaters, are, arranged, such, that, tickets, are, checked, at, the, entrance, into, the, entire, plaza, rather, than, before, each, theater, at, a, theater, with, a, sold, out, show, there, is, often, an, additional, ticket, check, to, make, sure, that, everybody, with, a, ticket, for, that, show, can, find, a, seat, the, lobby, may, be, before, or, after, the, ticket, check, in, africa, ster, kinekor, has, the, largest, market, share, in, south, africa, nu, metro, cinemas, is, another, cinema,
