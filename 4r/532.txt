the, decorative, arts, are, arts, or, crafts, whose, aim, is, the, design, and, manufacture, of, objects, that, are, both, beautiful, and, functional, this, includes, most, of, the, objects, for, the, interiors, of, buildings, as, well, as, interior, design, but, typically, excludes, architecture, ceramic, art, metalwork, furniture, jewellery, fashion, various, forms, of, the, textile, arts, and, glassware, are, major, groupings, applied, arts, largely, overlap, with, the, decorative, arts, and, in, modern, parlance, they, are, both, often, placed, under, the, umbrella, category, of, design, the, decorative, arts, are, often, categorized, in, distinction, to, the, fine, arts, namely, painting, drawing, photography, and, large, scale, sculpture, which, generally, produce, objects, solely, for, their, aesthetic, quality, and, capacity, to, stimulate, the, intellect, the, distinction, between, the, decorative, and, fine, arts, essentially, arose, from, the, post, renaissance, art, of, the, west, where, the, distinction, is, for, the, most, part, meaningful, this, distinction, is, much, less, meaningful, when, considering, the, art, of, other, cultures, and, periods, where, the, most, valued, works, or, even, all, works, include, those, in, decorative, media, for, example, islamic, art, in, many, periods, and, places, consists, entirely, of, the, decorative, arts, often, using, geometric, and, plant, forms, as, does, the, art, of, many, traditional, cultures, the, distinction, between, decorative, and, fine, arts, is, not, very, useful, for, appreciating, chinese, art, and, neither, is, it, for, understanding, early, medieval, art, in, europe, during, that, period, in, europe, fine, arts, such, as, manuscript, illumination, and, monumental, sculpture, existed, but, the, most, prestigious, works, tended, to, be, in, goldsmith, work, in, cast, metals, such, as, bronze, or, in, other, techniques, such, as, ivory, carving, large, scale, wall, paintings, were, much, less, regarded, crudely, executed, and, rarely, mentioned, in, contemporary, sources, they, were, probably, seen, as, an, inferior, substitute, for, mosaic, which, for, the, period, must, be, considered, a, fine, art, though, in, recent, centuries, mosaics, have, tended, to, be, considered, decorative, a, similar, fate, has, befallen, tapestry, which, late, medieval, and, renaissance, royalty, regarded, as, the, most, magnificent, artform, and, was, certainly, the, most, expensive, the, term, ars, sacra, sacred, arts, is, sometimes, used, for, medieval, christian, art, executed, in, metal, ivory, textiles, and, other, more, valuable, materials, but, not, for, rare, secular, works, from, that, period, the, view, of, decoration, as, a, lesser, art, was, formally, challenged, in, the, 1970s, by, writers, and, art, historians, like, amy, goldin, and, anne, swartz, the, argument, for, a, singular, narrative, in, art, had, lost, traction, by, the, close, of, the, 20th, century, through, post, modernist, irony, and, increasing, curatorial, interest, in, street, art, and, in, ethnic, decorative, traditions, the, pattern, and, decoration, movement, in, new, york, galleries, in, the, 1980s, though, short, lived, opened, the, way, to, a, more, inclusive, evaluation, of, the, value, of, art, objects, modern, understanding, of, the, art, of, many, cultures, tends, to, be, distorted, by, the, modern, privileging, of, fine, visual, arts, media, over, others, as, well, as, the, very, different, survival, rates, of, works, in, different, media, works, in, metal, above, all, in, precious, metals, are, liable, to, be, recycled, as, soon, as, they, fall, from, fashion, and, were, often, used, by, owners, as, repositories, of, wealth, to, be, melted, down, when, extra, money, was, needed, illuminated, manuscripts, have, a, much, higher, survival, rate, especially, in, the, hands, of, the, church, as, there, was, little, value, in, the, materials, and, they, were, easy, to, store, the, promotion, of, the, fine, arts, over, the, decorative, in, european, thought, can, largely, be, traced, to, the, renaissance, when, italian, theorists, such, as, vasari, promoted, artistic, values, exemplified, by, the, artists, of, the, high, renaissance, that, placed, little, value, on, the, cost, of, materials, or, the, amount, of, skilled, work, required, to, produce, a, work, but, instead, valued, artistic, imagination, and, the, individual, touch, of, the, hand, of, a, supremely, gifted, master, such, as, michelangelo, raphael, or, leonardo, da, vinci, reviving, to, some, extent, the, approach, of, antiquity, most, european, art, during, the, middle, ages, had, been, produced, under, a, very, different, set, of, values, where, both, expensive, materials, and, virtuoso, displays, in, difficult, techniques, had, been, highly, valued, in, china, both, approaches, had, co, existed, for, many, centuries, ink, wash, painting, mostly, of, landscapes, was, to, a, large, extent, produced, by, and, for, the, scholar, bureaucrats, or, literati, and, was, intended, as, an, expression, of, the, artist, s, imagination, above, all, while, other, major, fields, of, art, including, the, very, important, chinese, ceramics, produced, in, effectively, industrial, conditions, were, produced, according, to, a, completely, different, set, of, artistic, values, the, lower, status, given, to, works, of, decorative, art, in, contrast, to, fine, art, narrowed, with, the, rise, of, the, arts, and, crafts, movement, this, aesthetic, movement, of, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, was, born, in, england, and, inspired, by, the, writings, of, thomas, carlyle, john, ruskin, and, william, morris, the, movement, represented, the, beginning, of, a, greater, appreciation, of, the, decorative, arts, throughout, europe, the, appeal, of, the, arts, and, crafts, movement, to, a, new, generation, led, the, english, architect, and, designer, arthur, heygate, mackmurdo, to, organize, the, century, guild, for, craftsmen, in, 1882, championing, the, idea, that, there, was, no, meaningful, difference, between, the, fine, and, decorative, arts, many, converts, both, from, professional, artists, ranks, and, from, among, the, intellectual, class, as, a, whole, helped, spread, the, ideas, of, the, movement, the, influence, of, the, arts, and, crafts, movement, led, to, the, decorative, arts, being, given, a, greater, appreciation, and, status, in, society, and, this, was, soon, reflected, by, changes, in, the, law, until, the, enactment, of, the, copyright, act, 1911, only, works, of, fine, art, had, been, protected, from, unauthorized, copying, the, 1911, act, extended, the, definition, of, an, artistic, work, to, include, works, of, artistic, craftsmanship, in, the, context, of, mass, production, and, consumerism, some, individuals, will, attempt, to, create, or, maintain, their, lifestyle, or, to, construct, their, identity, when, forced, to, accept, mass, produced, identical, objects, in, their, life, according, to, colin, campbell, in, his, piece, the, craft, consumer, this, is, done, by, selecting, goods, with, specific, intentions, in, mind, to, alter, them, instead, of, accepting, a, foreign, object, for, what, it, is, the, foreign, object, is, incorporated, and, changed, to, fit, one, s, lifestyle, and, choices, or, customized, one, way, to, achieve, a, customized, look, and, feel, to, common, objects, is, to, change, their, external, appearance, by, applying, decorative, techniques, as, in, decoupage, art, cars, truck, art, in, south, asia, and, ikea, hacking
