an, orchestra, r, k, s, t, r, or, ki, str, is, a, large, instrumental, ensemble, typical, of, classical, music, which, combines, instruments, from, different, families, there, are, typically, four, main, sections, of, instruments, other, instruments, such, as, the, piano, harpsichord, pipe, organ, and, celesta, may, sometimes, appear, in, a, fifth, keyboard, section, or, may, stand, alone, as, soloist, instruments, as, may, the, concert, harp, and, for, performances, of, some, modern, compositions, electronic, instruments, and, guitars, a, full, size, western, orchestra, may, sometimes, be, called, a, symphony, orchestra, or, philharmonic, orchestra, from, greek, phil, loving, and, harmony, the, number, of, musicians, employed, in, a, given, performance, may, vary, from, seventy, to, over, one, hundred, depending, on, the, work, being, played, and, the, venue, size, a, chamber, orchestra, sometimes, a, concert, orchestra, is, a, smaller, ensemble, of, not, more, than, about, fifty, musicians, orchestras, that, specialize, in, the, baroque, music, of, for, example, johann, sebastian, bach, and, george, frideric, handel, or, classical, repertoire, such, as, that, of, haydn, and, mozart, tend, to, be, smaller, than, orchestras, performing, a, romantic, music, repertoire, such, as, the, symphonies, of, ludwig, van, beethoven, and, johannes, brahms, the, typical, orchestra, grew, in, size, throughout, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, reaching, a, peak, with, the, large, orchestras, of, as, many, as, 120, players, called, for, in, the, works, of, richard, wagner, and, later, gustav, mahler, orchestras, are, usually, led, by, a, conductor, who, directs, the, performance, with, movements, of, the, hands, and, arms, often, made, easier, for, the, musicians, to, see, by, using, a, short, wooden, rod, known, as, a, conductor, s, baton, the, conductor, unifies, the, orchestra, sets, the, tempo, and, shapes, the, sound, of, the, ensemble, the, conductor, also, prepares, the, orchestra, by, leading, rehearsals, before, the, public, concert, in, which, the, conductor, provides, instructions, to, the, musicians, on, their, interpretation, of, the, music, being, performed, the, leader, of, the, first, violin, section, commonly, called, the, concertmaster, also, plays, an, important, role, in, leading, the, musicians, in, the, baroque, music, era, 1600, 1750, orchestras, were, often, led, by, the, concertmaster, or, by, a, chord, playing, musician, performing, the, basso, continuo, parts, on, a, harpsichord, or, pipe, organ, a, tradition, that, some, 20th, century, and, 21st, century, early, music, ensembles, continue, orchestras, play, a, wide, range, of, repertoire, including, symphonies, opera, and, ballet, overtures, concertos, for, solo, instruments, and, pit, ensembles, for, operas, ballets, and, some, types, of, musical, theatre, e, g, gilbert, and, sullivan, operettas, amateur, orchestras, include, youth, orchestras, made, up, of, students, from, an, elementary, school, a, high, school, or, a, university, and, community, orchestras, typically, they, are, made, up, of, amateur, musicians, from, a, particular, city, or, region, the, term, orchestra, derives, from, the, greek, orchestra, the, name, for, the, area, in, front, of, a, stage, in, ancient, greek, theatre, reserved, for, the, greek, chorus, in, the, baroque, era, the, size, and, composition, of, an, orchestra, were, not, standardised, there, were, large, differences, in, size, instrumentation, and, playing, styles, and, therefore, in, orchestral, soundscapes, and, palettes, between, the, various, european, regions, the, baroque, orchestra, ranged, from, smaller, orchestras, or, ensembles, with, one, player, per, part, to, larger, scale, orchestras, with, many, players, per, part, examples, of, the, smaller, variety, were, bach, s, orchestras, for, example, in, koethen, where, he, had, access, to, an, ensemble, of, up, to, 18, players, examples, of, large, scale, baroque, orchestras, would, include, corelli, s, orchestra, in, rome, which, ranged, between, 35, and, 80, players, for, day, to, day, performances, being, enlarged, to, 150, players, for, special, occasions, in, the, classical, era, the, orchestra, became, more, standardized, with, a, small, to, medium, sized, string, section, and, a, core, wind, section, consisting, of, pairs, of, oboes, flutes, bassoons, and, horns, sometimes, supplemented, by, percussion, and, pairs, of, clarinets, and, trumpets, the, so, called, standard, complement, of, doubled, winds, and, brass, in, the, orchestra, pioneered, in, the, late, 18th, century, and, consolidated, during, the, first, half, of, the, 19th, century, is, generally, attributed, to, the, forces, called, for, by, beethoven, after, haydn, and, mozart, beethoven, s, instrumentation, almost, always, included, paired, flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, horns, and, trumpets, the, exceptions, are, his, symphony, no, 4, violin, concerto, and, piano, concerto, no, 4, which, each, specify, a, single, flute, beethoven, carefully, calculated, the, expansion, of, this, particular, timbral, palette, in, symphonies, 3, 5, 6, and, 9, for, an, innovative, effect, the, third, horn, in, the, eroica, symphony, arrives, to, provide, not, only, some, harmonic, flexibility, but, also, the, effect, of, choral, brass, in, the, trio, movement, piccolo, contrabassoon, and, trombones, add, to, the, triumphal, finale, of, his, symphony, no, 5, a, piccolo, and, a, pair, of, trombones, help, deliver, the, effect, of, storm, and, sunshine, in, the, sixth, also, known, as, the, pastoral, symphony, the, ninth, asks, for, a, second, pair, of, horns, for, reasons, similar, to, the, eroica, four, horns, has, since, become, standard, beethoven, s, use, of, piccolo, contrabassoon, trombones, and, untuned, percussion, plus, chorus, and, vocal, soloists, in, his, finale, are, his, earliest, suggestion, that, the, timbral, boundaries, of, the, symphony, might, be, expanded, for, several, decades, after, his, death, symphonic, instrumentation, was, faithful, to, beethoven, s, well, established, model, with, few, exceptions, the, invention, of, the, piston, and, rotary, valve, by, heinrich, st, lzel, and, friedrich, bl, hmel, both, silesians, in, 1815, was, the, first, in, a, series, of, innovations, which, impacted, the, orchestra, including, the, development, of, modern, keywork, for, the, flute, by, theobald, boehm, and, the, innovations, of, adolphe, sax, in, the, woodwinds, notably, the, invention, of, the, saxophone, these, advances, would, lead, hector, berlioz, to, write, a, landmark, book, on, instrumentation, which, were, the, first, systematic, treatise, on, using, instrumental, sound, as, an, expressive, element, of, music, the, next, major, expansion, of, symphonic, practice, came, from, richard, wagner, s, bayreuth, orchestra, founded, to, accompany, his, musical, dramas, wagner, s, works, for, the, stage, were, scored, with, unprecedented, scope, and, complexity, indeed, his, score, to, das, rheingold, calls, for, six, harps, thus, wagner, envisioned, an, ever, more, demanding, role, for, the, conductor, of, the, theatre, orchestra, as, he, elaborated, in, his, influential, work, on, conducting, this, brought, about, a, revolution, in, orchestral, composition, and, set, the, style, for, orchestral, performance, for, the, next, eighty, years, wagner, s, theories, re, examined, the, importance, of, tempo, dynamics, bowing, of, string, instruments, and, the, role, of, principals, in, the, orchestra, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, symphony, orchestras, were, larger, better, funded, and, better, trained, than, previously, consequently, composers, could, compose, larger, and, more, ambitious, works, the, works, of, gustav, mahler, were, particularly, innovative, in, his, later, symphonies, such, as, the, mammoth, symphony, no, 8, mahler, pushes, the, furthest, boundaries, of, orchestral, size, employing, large, forces, by, the, late, romantic, era, orchestras, could, support, the, most, enormous, forms, of, symphonic, expression, with, huge, string, and, brass, sections, and, an, expanded, range, of, percussion, instruments, with, the, recording, era, beginning, the, standards, of, performance, were, pushed, to, a, new, level, because, a, recorded, symphony, could, be, listened, to, closely, and, even, minor, errors, in, intonation, or, ensemble, which, might, not, be, noticeable, in, a, live, performance, could, be, heard, by, critics, as, recording, technologies, improved, over, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, eventually, small, errors, in, a, recording, could, be, fixed, by, audio, editing, or, overdubbing, some, older, conductors, and, composers, could, remember, a, time, when, simply, getting, through, the, music, as, well, as, possible, was, the, standard, combined, with, the, wider, audience, made, possible, by, recording, this, led, to, a, renewed, focus, on, particular, star, conductors, and, on, a, high, standard, of, orchestral, execution, the, typical, symphony, orchestra, consists, of, four, groups, of, related, musical, instruments, called, the, woodwinds, brass, percussion, and, strings, other, instruments, such, as, the, piano, accordion, and, celesta, may, sometimes, be, grouped, into, a, fifth, section, such, as, a, keyboard, section, or, may, stand, alone, as, may, the, concert, harp, and, electric, and, electronic, instruments, the, orchestra, depending, on, the, size, contains, almost, all, of, the, standard, instruments, in, each, group, in, the, history, of, the, orchestra, its, instrumentation, has, been, expanded, over, time, often, agreed, to, have, been, standardized, by, the, classical, period, and, ludwig, van, beethoven, s, influence, on, the, classical, model, in, the, 20th, and, 21st, century, new, repertory, demands, expanded, the, instrumentation, of, the, orchestra, resulting, in, a, flexible, use, of, the, classical, model, instruments, and, newly, developed, electric, and, electronic, instruments, in, various, combinations, in, the, mid, 20th, century, several, attempts, were, made, in, germany, and, the, united, states, to, confine, the, instrumentation, of, the, symphonic, orchestra, exclusively, to, groups, of, one, instrument, in, this, configuration, the, symphonic, orchestra, consisted, entirely, of, free, reed, chromatic, accordions, which, were, modified, to, recreate, the, full, range, of, orchestral, sounds, and, timbres, during, the, performance, of, orthodox, western, classical, music, the, terms, symphony, orchestra, and, philharmonic, orchestra, may, be, used, to, distinguish, different, ensembles, from, the, same, locality, such, as, the, london, symphony, orchestra, and, the, london, philharmonic, orchestra, a, symphony, or, philharmonic, orchestra, will, usually, have, over, eighty, musicians, on, its, roster, in, some, cases, over, a, hundred, but, the, actual, number, of, musicians, employed, in, a, particular, performance, may, vary, according, to, the, work, being, played, and, the, size, of, the, venue, a, chamber, orchestra, is, usually, a, smaller, ensemble, a, major, chamber, orchestra, might, employ, as, many, as, fifty, musicians, but, some, are, much, smaller, concert, orchestra, is, an, alternative, term, as, in, the, bbc, concert, orchestra, and, the, rt, concert, orchestra, apart, from, the, core, orchestral, complement, various, other, instruments, are, called, for, occasionally, these, include, the, flugelhorn, and, cornet, saxophones, and, classical, guitars, for, example, appear, in, some, 19th, through, 21st, century, scores, while, appearing, only, as, featured, solo, instruments, in, some, works, for, example, maurice, ravel, s, orchestration, of, modest, mussorgsky, s, pictures, at, an, exhibition, and, sergei, rachmaninoff, s, symphonic, dances, the, saxophone, is, included, in, other, works, such, as, ravel, s, bol, ro, sergei, prokofiev, s, romeo, and, juliet, suites, 1, and, 2, vaughan, williams, symphonies, no, 6, and, no, 9, and, william, walton, s, belshazzar, s, feast, and, many, other, works, as, a, member, of, the, orchestral, ensemble, the, euphonium, is, featured, in, a, few, late, romantic, and, 20th, century, works, usually, playing, parts, marked, tenor, tuba, including, gustav, holst, s, the, planets, and, richard, strauss, s, ein, heldenleben, the, wagner, tuba, a, modified, member, of, the, horn, family, appears, in, richard, wagner, s, cycle, der, ring, des, nibelungen, and, several, other, works, by, strauss, igor, stravinsky, as, featured, in, the, rite, of, spring, b, la, bart, k, and, others, it, also, has, a, notably, prominent, role, in, anton, bruckner, s, symphony, no, 7, in, e, major, cornets, appear, in, pyotr, ilyich, tchaikovsky, s, ballet, swan, lake, claude, debussy, s, la, mer, and, several, orchestral, works, by, hector, berlioz, unless, these, instruments, are, played, by, members, doubling, on, another, instrument, for, example, a, trombone, player, changing, to, euphonium, or, a, bassoon, player, switching, to, contrabassoon, for, a, certain, passage, orchestras, typically, hire, freelance, musicians, to, augment, their, regular, ensemble, the, 20th, century, orchestra, was, far, more, flexible, than, its, predecessors, in, beethoven, s, and, felix, mendelssohn, s, time, the, orchestra, was, composed, of, a, fairly, standard, core, of, instruments, which, was, very, rarely, modified, by, composers, as, time, progressed, and, as, the, romantic, period, saw, changes, in, accepted, modification, with, composers, such, as, berlioz, and, mahler, some, composers, used, multiple, harps, and, sound, effect, such, as, the, wind, machine, during, the, 20th, century, the, modern, orchestra, was, generally, standardized, with, the, modern, instrumentation, listed, below, nevertheless, by, the, mid, to, late, 20th, century, with, the, development, of, contemporary, classical, music, instrumentation, could, practically, be, hand, picked, by, the, composer, e, g, to, add, electric, instruments, such, as, electric, guitar, electronic, instruments, such, as, synthesizers, ondes, martenot, or, trautonium, as, well, as, other, non, western, instruments, or, other, instruments, not, traditionally, used, in, orchestras, including, the, bandoneon, free, bass, accordion, harmonica, jews, harp, mandola, and, water, percussion, with, this, history, in, mind, the, orchestra, can, be, analysed, in, five, eras, the, baroque, era, the, classical, era, early, mid, romantic, music, era, late, romantic, era, and, combined, modern, postmodern, eras, the, first, is, a, baroque, orchestra, i, e, j, s, bach, handel, vivaldi, which, generally, had, a, smaller, number, of, performers, and, in, which, one, or, more, chord, playing, instruments, the, basso, continuo, group, e, g, harpsichord, or, pipe, organ, and, assorted, bass, instruments, to, perform, the, bassline, played, an, important, role, the, second, is, a, typical, classical, period, orchestra, e, g, early, beethoven, along, with, mozart, and, haydn, which, used, a, smaller, group, of, performers, than, a, romantic, music, orchestra, and, a, fairly, standardized, instrumentation, the, third, is, typical, of, an, early, mid, romantic, era, e, g, schubert, berlioz, schumann, brahms, the, fourth, is, a, late, romantic, early, 20th, century, orchestra, e, g, wagner, mahler, stravinsky, to, the, common, complement, of, a, 2010, era, modern, orchestra, e, g, adams, barber, aaron, copland, glass, penderecki, among, the, instrument, groups, and, within, each, group, of, instruments, there, is, a, generally, accepted, hierarchy, every, instrumental, group, or, section, has, a, principal, who, is, generally, responsible, for, leading, the, group, and, playing, orchestral, solos, the, violins, are, divided, into, two, groups, first, violin, and, second, violin, with, the, second, violins, playing, in, lower, registers, than, the, first, violins, playing, an, accompaniment, part, or, harmonizing, the, melody, played, by, the, first, violins, the, principal, first, violin, is, called, the, concertmaster, or, orchestra, leader, in, the, u, k, and, is, not, only, considered, the, leader, of, the, string, section, but, the, second, in, command, of, the, entire, orchestra, behind, only, the, conductor, the, concertmaster, leads, the, pre, concert, tuning, and, handles, musical, aspects, of, orchestra, management, such, as, determining, the, bowings, for, the, violins, or, the, entire, string, section, the, concertmaster, usually, sits, to, the, conductor, s, left, closest, to, the, audience, there, is, also, a, principal, second, violin, a, principal, viola, a, principal, cello, and, a, principal, bass, the, principal, trombone, is, considered, the, leader, of, the, low, brass, section, while, the, principal, trumpet, is, generally, considered, the, leader, of, the, entire, brass, section, while, the, oboe, often, provides, the, tuning, note, for, the, orchestra, due, to, a, 300, year, old, convention, there, is, generally, no, designated, principal, of, the, woodwind, section, though, in, woodwind, ensembles, the, flute, is, often, the, presumptive, leader, instead, each, principal, confers, with, the, others, as, equals, in, the, case, of, musical, differences, of, opinion, most, sections, also, have, an, assistant, principal, or, co, principal, or, associate, principal, or, in, the, case, of, the, first, violins, an, assistant, concertmaster, who, often, plays, a, tutti, part, in, addition, to, replacing, the, principal, in, their, absence, a, section, string, player, plays, in, unison, with, the, rest, of, the, section, except, in, the, case, of, divided, divisi, parts, where, upper, and, lower, parts, in, the, music, are, often, assigned, to, outside, nearer, the, audience, and, inside, seated, players, where, a, solo, part, is, called, for, in, a, string, section, the, section, leader, invariably, plays, that, part, the, section, leader, or, principal, of, a, string, section, is, also, responsible, for, determining, the, bowings, often, based, on, the, bowings, set, out, by, the, concertmaster, in, some, cases, the, principal, of, a, string, section, may, use, a, slightly, different, bowing, than, the, concertmaster, to, accommodate, the, requirements, of, playing, their, instrument, e, g, the, double, bass, section, principals, of, a, string, section, will, also, lead, entrances, for, their, section, typically, by, lifting, the, bow, before, the, entrance, to, ensure, the, section, plays, together, tutti, wind, and, brass, players, generally, play, a, unique, but, non, solo, part, section, percussionists, play, parts, assigned, to, them, by, the, principal, percussionist, in, modern, times, the, musicians, are, usually, directed, by, a, conductor, although, early, orchestras, did, not, have, one, giving, this, role, to, the, concertmaster, or, the, harpsichordist, playing, the, continuo, some, modern, orchestras, also, do, without, conductors, particularly, smaller, orchestras, and, those, specializing, in, historically, accurate, so, called, period, performances, of, baroque, and, earlier, music, the, most, frequently, performed, repertoire, for, a, symphony, orchestra, is, western, classical, music, or, opera, however, orchestras, are, used, sometimes, in, popular, music, e, g, to, accompany, a, rock, or, pop, band, in, a, concert, extensively, in, film, music, and, increasingly, often, in, video, game, music, orchestras, are, also, used, in, the, symphonic, metal, genre, the, term, orchestra, can, also, be, applied, to, a, jazz, ensemble, for, example, in, the, performance, of, big, band, music, in, the, 2000s, all, tenured, members, of, a, professional, orchestra, normally, audition, for, positions, in, the, ensemble, performers, typically, play, one, or, more, solo, pieces, of, the, auditionee, s, choice, such, as, a, movement, of, a, concerto, a, solo, bach, movement, and, a, variety, of, excerpts, from, the, orchestral, literature, that, are, advertised, in, the, audition, poster, so, the, auditionees, can, prepare, the, excerpts, are, typically, the, most, technically, challenging, parts, and, solos, from, the, orchestral, literature, orchestral, auditions, are, typically, held, in, front, of, a, panel, that, includes, the, conductor, the, concertmaster, the, principal, player, of, the, section, for, which, the, auditionee, is, applying, and, possibly, other, principal, players, the, most, promising, candidates, from, the, first, round, of, auditions, are, invited, to, return, for, a, second, or, third, round, of, auditions, which, allows, the, conductor, and, the, panel, to, compare, the, best, candidates, performers, may, be, asked, to, sight, read, orchestral, music, the, final, stage, of, the, audition, process, in, some, orchestras, is, a, test, week, in, which, the, performer, plays, with, the, orchestra, for, a, week, or, two, which, allows, the, conductor, and, principal, players, to, see, if, the, individual, can, function, well, in, an, actual, rehearsal, and, performance, setting, there, are, a, range, of, different, employment, arrangements, the, most, sought, after, positions, are, permanent, tenured, positions, in, the, orchestra, orchestras, also, hire, musicians, on, contracts, ranging, in, length, from, a, single, concert, to, a, full, season, or, more, contract, performers, may, be, hired, for, individual, concerts, when, the, orchestra, is, doing, an, exceptionally, large, late, romantic, era, orchestral, work, or, to, substitute, for, a, permanent, member, who, is, sick, a, professional, musician, who, is, hired, to, perform, for, a, single, concert, is, sometimes, called, a, sub, some, contract, musicians, may, be, hired, to, replace, permanent, members, for, the, period, that, the, permanent, member, is, on, parental, leave, or, disability, leave, historically, major, professional, orchestras, have, been, mostly, or, entirely, composed, of, men, the, first, women, members, hired, in, professional, orchestras, have, been, harpists, the, vienna, philharmonic, for, example, did, not, accept, women, to, permanent, membership, until, 1997, far, later, than, comparable, orchestras, the, other, orchestras, ranked, among, the, world, s, top, five, by, gramophone, in, 2008, the, last, major, orchestra, to, appoint, a, woman, to, a, permanent, position, was, the, berlin, philharmonic, in, february, 1996, the, vienna, philharmonic, s, principal, flute, dieter, flury, told, westdeutscher, rundfunk, that, accepting, women, would, be, gambling, with, the, emotional, unity, emotionelle, geschlossenheit, that, this, organism, currently, has, in, april, 1996, the, orchestra, s, press, secretary, wrote, that, compensating, for, the, expected, leaves, of, absence, of, maternity, leave, would, be, a, problem, in, 1997, the, vienna, philharmonic, was, facing, protests, during, a, tour, by, the, national, organization, for, women, and, the, international, alliance, for, women, in, music, finally, after, being, held, up, to, increasing, ridicule, even, in, socially, conservative, austria, members, of, the, orchestra, gathered, in, an, extraordinary, meeting, on, the, eve, of, their, departure, and, agreed, to, admit, a, woman, anna, lelkes, as, harpist, as, of, 2013, the, orchestra, has, six, female, members, one, of, them, violinist, albena, danailova, became, one, of, the, orchestra, s, concertmasters, in, 2008, the, first, woman, to, hold, that,

opera, during, the, early, romantic, era, composers, such, as, beethoven, and, mendelssohn, began, to, use, the, term, to, refer, to, independent, self, existing, instrumental, programmatic, works, that, presaged, genres, such, as, the, symphonic, poem, a, form, devised, by, franz, liszt, in, several, works, that, began, as, dramatic, overtures, these, were, at, first, undoubtedly, intended, to, be, played, at, the, head, of, a, programme, in, the, 1850s, the, concert, overture, began, to, be, supplanted, by, the, symphonic, poem, orchestras, also, play, with, instrumental, soloists, in, concertos, during, concertos, the, orchestra, plays, an, accompaniment, role, to, the, soloist, e, g, a, solo, violinist, or, pianist, and, at, times, introduces, musical, themes, or, interludes, while, the, soloist, is, not, playing, orchestras, also, play, during, operas, ballets, some, musical, theatre, works, and, some, choral, works, both, sacred, works, such, as, masses, and, secular, works, in, operas, and, ballets, the, orchestra, accompanies, the, singers, and, dancers, respectively, and, plays, overtures, and, interludes, where, the, melodies, played, by, the, orchestra, take, centre, stage, in, the, baroque, era, orchestras, performed, in, a, range, of, venues, including, at, the, fine, houses, of, aristocrats, in, opera, halls, and, in, churches, some, wealthy, aristocrats, had, an, orchestra, in, residence, at, their, estate, to, entertain, them, and, their, guests, with, performances, during, the, classical, era, as, composers, increasingly, sought, out, financial, support, from, the, general, public, orchestra, concerts, were, increasingly, held, in, public, concert, halls, where, music, lovers, could, buy, tickets, to, hear, the, orchestra, aristocratic, patronage, of, orchestras, continued, during, the, classical, era, but, this, went, on, alongside, public, concerts, in, the, 20th, and, 21st, century, orchestras, found, a, new, patron, governments, many, orchestras, in, north, america, and, europe, receive, part, of, their, funding, from, national, regional, level, governments, e, g, state, governments, in, the, u, s, or, city, governments, these, government, subsidies, make, up, part, of, orchestra, revenue, along, with, ticket, sales, charitable, donations, if, the, orchestra, is, registered, as, a, charity, and, other, fundraising, activities, with, the, invention, of, successive, technologies, including, sound, recording, radio, broadcasting, television, broadcasting, and, internet, based, streaming, and, downloading, of, concert, videos, orchestras, have, been, able, to, find, new, revenue, sources, one, of, the, great, unmentionable, of, orchestral, playing, is, faking, the, process, by, which, an, orchestral, musician, gives, the, false, impression, of, playing, every, note, as, written, typically, for, a, very, challenging, passage, that, is, very, high, or, very, fast, while, not, actually, playing, the, notes, that, are, in, the, printed, music, part, an, article, in, the, strad, states, that, all, orchestral, musicians, even, those, in, the, top, orchestras, occasionally, fake, certain, passages, one, reason, that, musicians, fake, is, because, there, are, not, enough, rehearsals, another, factor, is, the, extreme, challenges, in, 20th, century, and, 21st, century, contemporary, pieces, some, professionals, said, faking, was, necessary, in, anything, from, ten, to, almost, ninety, per, cent, of, some, modern, works, professional, players, who, were, interviewed, were, of, a, consensus, that, faking, may, be, acceptable, when, a, part, is, not, written, well, for, the, instrument, but, faking, just, because, you, haven, t, practised, the, music, is, not, acceptable, with, the, advent, of, the, early, music, movement, smaller, orchestras, where, players, worked, on, execution, of, works, in, styles, derived, from, the, study, of, older, treatises, on, playing, became, common, these, include, the, orchestra, of, the, age, of, enlightenment, the, london, classical, players, under, the, direction, of, sir, roger, norrington, and, the, academy, of, ancient, music, under, christopher, hogwood, among, others, in, the, united, states, the, late, 20th, century, saw, a, crisis, of, funding, and, support, for, orchestras, the, size, and, cost, of, a, symphony, orchestra, compared, to, the, size, of, the, base, of, supporters, became, an, issue, that, struck, at, the, core, of, the, institution, few, orchestras, could, fill, auditoriums, and, the, time, honored, season, subscription, system, became, increasingly, anachronistic, as, more, and, more, listeners, would, buy, tickets, on, an, ad, hoc, basis, for, individual, events, orchestral, endowments, and, more, centrally, to, the, daily, operation, of, american, orchestras, orchestral, donors, have, seen, investment, portfolios, shrink, or, produce, lower, yields, reducing, the, ability, of, donors, to, contribute, further, there, has, been, a, trend, toward, donors, finding, other, social, causes, more, compelling, while, government, funding, is, less, central, to, american, than, european, orchestras, cuts, in, such, funding, are, still, significant, for, american, ensembles, finally, the, drastic, drop, in, revenues, from, recording, related, to, changes, in, the, recording, industry, itself, began, a, period, of, change, that, has, yet, to, reach, its, conclusion, u, s, orchestras, that, have, gone, into, chapter, 11, bankruptcy, include, the, philadelphia, orchestra, april, 2011, and, the, louisville, orchestra, december, 2010, orchestras, that, have, gone, into, chapter, 7, bankruptcy, and, have, ceased, operations, include, the, northwest, chamber, orchestra, in, 2006, the, honolulu, orchestra, in, march, 2011, the, new, mexico, symphony, orchestra, in, april, 2011, and, the, syracuse, symphony, in, june, 2011, the, festival, of, orchestras, in, orlando, florida, ceased, operations, at, the, end, of, march, 2011, one, source, of, financial, difficulties, that, received, notice, and, criticism, was, high, salaries, for, music, directors, of, us, orchestras, which, led, several, high, profile, conductors, to, take, pay, cuts, in, recent, years, music, administrators, such, as, michael, tilson, thomas, and, esa, pekka, salonen, argued, that, new, music, new, means, of, presenting, it, and, a, renewed, relationship, with, the, community, could, revitalize, the, symphony, orchestra, the, american, critic, greg, sandow, has, argued, in, detail, that, orchestras, must, revise, their, approach, to, music, performance, the, concert, experience, marketing, public, relations, community, involvement, and, presentation, to, bring, them, in, line, with, the, expectations, of, 21st, century, audiences, immersed, in, popular, culture, it, is, not, uncommon, for, contemporary, composers, to, use, unconventional, instruments, including, various, synthesizers, to, achieve, desired, effects, many, however, find, more, conventional, orchestral, configuration, to, provide, better, possibilities, for, color, and, depth, composers, like, john, adams, often, employ, romantic, size, orchestras, as, in, adams, opera, nixon, in, china, philip, glass, and, others, may, be, more, free, yet, still, identify, size, boundaries, glass, in, particular, has, recently, turned, to, conventional, orchestras, in, works, like, the, concerto, for, cello, and, orchestra, and, the, violin, concerto, no, 2, along, with, a, decrease, in, funding, some, u, s, orchestras, have, reduced, their, overall, personnel, as, well, as, the, number, of, players, appearing, in, performances, the, reduced, numbers, in, performance, are, usually, confined, to, the, string, section, since, the, numbers, here, have, traditionally, been, flexible, as, multiple, players, typically, play, from, the, same, part, conducting, is, the, art, of, directing, a, musical, performance, such, as, an, orchestral, or, choral, concert, the, primary, duties, of, the, conductor, are, to, set, the, tempo, ensure, correct, entries, by, various, members, of, the, ensemble, and, shape, the, phrasing, where, appropriate, to, convey, their, ideas, and, interpretation, a, conductor, communicates, with, their, musicians, primarily, through, hand, gestures, typically, though, not, invariably, with, the, aid, of, a, baton, and, may, use, other, gestures, or, signals, such, as, eye, contact, with, relevant, performers, a, conductor, s, directions, will, almost, invariably, be, supplemented, or, reinforced, by, verbal, instructions, or, suggestions, to, their, musicians, in, rehearsal, prior, to, a, performance, the, conductor, typically, stands, on, a, raised, podium, with, a, large, music, stand, for, the, full, score, which, contains, the, musical, notation, for, all, the, instruments, and, voices, since, the, mid, 18th, century, most, conductors, have, not, played, an, instrument, when, conducting, although, in, earlier, periods, of, classical, music, history, leading, an, ensemble, while, playing, an, instrument, was, common, in, baroque, music, from, the, 1600s, to, the, 1750s, the, group, would, typically, be, led, by, the, harpsichordist, or, first, violinist, see, concertmaster, an, approach, that, in, modern, times, has, been, revived, by, several, music, directors, for, music, from, this, period, conducting, while, playing, a, piano, or, synthesizer, may, also, be, done, with, musical, theatre, pit, orchestras, communication, is, typically, non, verbal, during, a, performance, this, is, strictly, the, case, in, art, music, but, in, jazz, big, bands, or, large, pop, ensembles, there, may, be, occasional, spoken, instructions, such, as, a, count, in, however, in, rehearsals, frequent, interruptions, allow, the, conductor, to, give, verbal, directions, as, to, how, the, music, should, be, played, or, sung, conductors, act, as, guides, to, the, orchestras, or, choirs, they, conduct, they, choose, the, works, to, be, performed, and, study, their, scores, to, which, they, may, make, certain, adjustments, e, g, regarding, tempo, articulation, phrasing, repetitions, of, sections, and, so, on, work, out, their, interpretation, and, relay, their, vision, to, the, performers, they, may, also, attend, to, organizational, matters, such, as, scheduling, rehearsals, planning, a, concert, season, hearing, auditions, and, selecting, members, and, promoting, their, ensemble, in, the, media, orchestras, choirs, concert, bands, and, other, sizable, musical, ensembles, such, as, big, bands, are, usually, led, by, conductors, in, the, baroque, music, era, 1600, 1750, most, orchestras, were, led, by, one, of, the, musicians, typically, the, principal, first, violin, called, the, concertmaster, the, concertmaster, would, lead, the, tempo, of, pieces, by, lifting, his, or, her, bow, in, a, rhythmic, manner, leadership, might, also, be, provided, by, one, of, the, chord, playing, instrumentalists, playing, the, basso, continuo, part, which, was, the, core, of, most, baroque, instrumental, ensemble, pieces, typically, this, would, be, a, harpsichord, player, a, pipe, organist, or, a, lutist, or, theorbo, player, a, keyboard, player, could, lead, the, ensemble, with, his, or, her, head, or, by, taking, one, of, the, hands, off, the, keyboard, to, lead, a, more, difficult, tempo, change, a, lutenist, or, theorbo, player, could, lead, by, lifting, the, instrument, neck, up, and, down, to, indicate, the, tempo, of, a, piece, or, to, lead, a, ritard, during, a, cadence, or, ending, in, some, works, which, combined, choirs, and, instrumental, ensembles, two, leaders, were, sometimes, used, a, concertmaster, to, lead, the, instrumentalists, and, a, chord, playing, performer, to, lead, the, singers, during, the, classical, music, period, c, 1720, 1800, the, practice, of, using, chordal, instruments, to, play, basso, continuo, was, gradually, phased, out, and, it, disappeared, completely, by, 1800, instead, ensembles, began, to, use, conductors, to, lead, the, orchestra, s, tempos, and, playing, style, while, the, concertmaster, played, an, additional, leadership, role, for, the, musicians, especially, the, string, players, who, imitate, the, bowstroke, and, playing, style, of, the, concertmaster, to, the, degree, that, is, feasible, for, the, different, stringed, instruments, in, 1922, the, idea, of, a, conductor, less, orchestra, was, revived, in, post, revolutionary, soviet, union, the, symphony, orchestra, persimfans, was, formed, without, a, conductor, because, the, founders, believed, that, the, ensemble, should, be, modeled, on, the, ideal, marxist, state, in, which, all, people, are, equal, as, such, its, members, felt, that, there, was, no, need, to, be, led, by, the, dictatorial, baton, of, a, conductor, instead, they, were, led, by, a, committee, which, determined, tempos, and, playing, styles, although, it, was, a, partial, success, within, the, soviet, union, the, principal, difficulty, with, the, concept, was, in, changing, tempo, during, performances, because, even, if, the, committee, had, issued, a, decree, about, where, a, tempo, change, should, take, place, there, was, no, leader, in, the, ensemble, to, guide, this, tempo, change, the, orchestra, survived, for, ten, years, before, stalin, s, cultural, politics, disbanded, it, by, taking, away, its, funding, in, western, nations, some, ensembles, such, as, the, orpheus, chamber, orchestra, based, in, new, york, city, have, had, more, success, with, conductorless, orchestras, although, decisions, are, likely, to, be, deferred, to, some, sense, of, leadership, within, the, ensemble, for, example, the, principal, wind, and, string, players, notably, the, concertmaster, others, have, returned, to, the, tradition, of, a, principal, player, usually, a, violinist, being, the, artistic, director, and, running, rehearsal, and, leading, concerts, examples, include, the, australian, chamber, orchestra, amsterdam, sinfonietta, candida, thompson, and, the, new, century, chamber, orchestra, as, well, as, part, of, the, early, music, movement, some, 20th, and, 21st, century, orchestras, have, revived, the, baroque, practice, of, having, no, conductor, on, the, podium, for, baroque, pieces, using, the, concertmaster, or, a, chord, playing, basso, continuo, performer, e, g, harpsichord, or, organ, to, lead, the, group, some, orchestral, works, specify, that, an, offstage, trumpet, should, be, used, or, that, other, instruments, from, the, orchestra, should, be, positioned, off, stage, or, behind, the, stage, to, create, a, haunted, mystical, effect, to, ensure, that, the, offstage, instrumentalist, s, play, in, time, sometimes, a, sub, conductor, will, be, stationed, offstage, with, a, clear, view, of, the, principal, conductor, examples, include, the, ending, of, neptune, from, gustav, holst, s, the, planets, the, principal, conductor, leads, the, large, orchestra, and, the, sub, conductor, relays, the, principal, conductor, s, tempo, and, gestures, to, the, offstage, musician, or, musicians, one, of, the, challenges, with, using, two, conductors, is, that, the, second, conductor, may, get, out, of, synchronization, with, the, main, conductor, or, may, mis, convey, or, misunderstand, the, principal, conductor, s, gestures, which, can, lead, to, the, offstage, instruments, being, out, of, time, in, the, late, 20th, century, and, early, 21st, century, some, orchestras, use, a, video, camera, pointed, at, the, principal, conductor, and, a, closed, circuit, tv, set, in, front, of, the, offstage, performers, instead, of, using, two, conductors, the, techniques, of, polystylism, and, polytempo, music, have, led, a, few, 20th, and, 21st, century, composers, to, write, music, where, multiple, orchestras, or, ensembles, perform, simultaneously, these, trends, have, brought, about, the, phenomenon, of, polyconductor, music, wherein, separate, sub, conductors, conduct, each, group, of, musicians, usually, one, principal, conductor, conducts, the, sub, conductors, thereby, shaping, the, overall, performance, in, percy, grainger, s, the, warriors, which, includes, three, conductors, the, primary, conductor, of, the, orchestra, a, secondary, conductor, directing, an, off, stage, brass, ensemble, and, a, tertiary, conductor, directing, percussion, and, harp, one, example, in, the, late, century, orchestral, music, is, karlheinz, stockhausen, s, gruppen, for, three, orchestras, which, are, placed, around, the, audience, this, way, the, sound, masses, could, be, spatialized, as, in, an, electroacoustic, work, gruppen, was, premiered, in, cologne, in, 1958, conducted, by, stockhausen, bruno, maderna, and, pierre, boulez, it, has, been, performed, in, 1996, by, simon, rattle, john, carewe, and, daniel, harding
