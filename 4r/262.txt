the, prince, italian, il, principe, latin, de, principatibus, is, a, 16th, century, political, treatise, written, by, the, italian, diplomat, philosopher, and, political, theorist, niccol, machiavelli, in, the, form, of, a, realistic, instruction, guide, for, new, princes, as, a, remarkable, general, theme, the, prince, appears, to, take, it, for, granted, that, immoral, acts, are, justified, if, they, can, help, achieve, political, glory, from, machiavelli, s, correspondence, a, version, was, apparently, being, written, in, 1513, using, a, latin, title, de, principatibus, of, principalities, however, the, printed, version, was, not, published, until, 1532, five, years, after, machiavelli, s, death, this, was, carried, out, with, the, permission, of, the, medici, pope, clement, vii, but, long, before, then, in, fact, since, the, first, appearance, of, the, prince, in, manuscript, controversy, had, swirled, about, his, writings, although, the, prince, was, written, as, if, it, were, a, traditional, work, in, the, mirrors, for, princes, style, it, was, generally, agreed, as, being, especially, innovative, this, is, partly, because, it, was, written, in, the, vernacular, italian, rather, than, latin, a, practice, that, had, become, increasingly, popular, since, the, publication, of, dante, s, divine, comedy, and, other, works, of, renaissance, literature, machiavelli, illustrates, his, reasoning, using, remarkable, comparisons, of, classical, biblical, and, medieval, events, including, many, seemingly, positive, references, to, the, murderous, career, of, cesare, borgia, which, occurred, during, machiavelli, s, own, diplomatic, career, the, prince, is, sometimes, claimed, to, be, one, of, the, first, works, of, modern, philosophy, especially, modern, political, philosophy, in, which, practical, effect, is, taken, to, be, more, important, than, any, abstract, ideal, its, world, view, came, in, direct, conflict, with, the, dominant, catholic, and, scholastic, doctrines, of, the, time, particularly, those, on, politics, and, ethics, this, short, treatise, is, the, most, remembered, of, machiavelli, s, works, and, the, most, responsible, for, the, later, pejorative, use, of, the, word, machiavellian, it, even, contributed, to, the, modern, negative, connotations, of, the, words, politics, and, politician, in, western, countries, in, subject, matter, it, overlaps, with, the, much, longer, discourses, on, livy, which, was, written, a, few, years, later, in, its, use, of, near, contemporary, italians, as, examples, of, people, who, perpetrated, criminal, deeds, for, political, ends, another, lesser, known, work, by, machiavelli, to, which, the, prince, has, been, compared, is, the, life, of, castruccio, castracani, each, part, of, the, prince, has, attracted, extensive, commentary, over, centuries, machiavelli, s, writings, continue, to, provoke, examination, of, leadership, and, government, posing, age, old, issues, regarding, the, nature, of, power, and, the, decisions, that, rulers, must, make, to, preserve, it, machiavelli, prefaces, his, work, with, an, introductory, letter, to, lorenzo, de, medici, duke, of, urbino, the, recipient, of, his, work, the, prince, starts, by, describing, its, subject, in, the, first, sentence, machiavelli, uses, the, word, state, italian, stato, which, could, also, mean, status, to, cover, in, neutral, terms, all, forms, of, organization, of, supreme, political, power, whether, republican, or, princely, how, the, word, state, acquired, its, modern, meaning, during, the, renaissance, has, been, the, subject, of, much, academic, debate, with, this, sentence, and, similar, ones, in, the, works, of, machiavelli, being, considered, particularly, important, machiavelli, explained, here, that, the, prince, is, about, princedoms, indicating, that, he, has, written, about, republics, elsewhere, which, is, a, reference, to, the, discourses, on, livy, commentators, note, that, in, fact, he, mixes, discussion, of, republics, into, this, work, in, many, places, effectively, treating, republics, as, a, type, of, princedom, with, many, strengths, more, importantly, and, less, traditionally, he, distinguishes, new, princedoms, from, established, hereditary, princedoms, he, deals, with, hereditary, princedoms, quickly, in, chapter, 2, saying, that, they, are, much, easier, to, rule, for, such, a, prince, unless, extraordinary, vices, cause, him, to, be, hated, it, is, reasonable, to, expect, that, his, subjects, will, be, naturally, well, disposed, towards, him, gilbert, 1938, 19, 23, comparing, this, claim, to, traditional, presentations, of, advice, for, princes, wrote, that, the, novelty, in, chapters, 1, and, 2, is, the, deliberate, purpose, of, dealing, with, a, new, ruler, who, will, need, to, establish, himself, in, defiance, of, custom, normally, these, types, of, works, were, addressed, only, to, hereditary, princes, he, thinks, machiavelli, may, have, been, influenced, by, tacitus, as, well, as, his, own, experience, this, categorization, of, regime, types, is, also, un, aristotelian, and, apparently, simpler, than, the, traditional, one, found, for, example, in, aristotle, s, politics, which, divides, regimes, into, those, ruled, by, a, single, monarch, an, oligarchy, or, by, the, people, in, a, democracy, machiavelli, also, ignores, the, classical, distinctions, between, the, good, and, corrupt, forms, for, example, between, monarchy, and, tyranny, new, princedoms, are, either, totally, new, or, they, are, mixed, meaning, that, they, are, new, parts, of, an, older, state, already, belonging, to, that, prince, machiavelli, generalizes, that, there, were, several, virtuous, roman, ways, to, hold, a, newly, acquired, province, using, a, republic, as, an, example, of, how, new, princes, can, act, more, generally, machiavelli, emphasizes, that, one, should, have, regard, not, only, for, present, problems, but, also, for, the, future, ones, one, should, not, enjoy, the, benefit, of, time, but, rather, the, benefit, of, one, s, virtue, and, prudence, because, time, can, bring, evil, as, well, as, good, machiavelli, notes, in, this, chapter, on, the, natural, and, ordinary, desire, to, acquire, and, as, such, those, who, act, on, this, desire, can, be, praised, or, blamed, depending, on, the, success, of, their, acquisitions, he, then, goes, into, detail, about, how, the, king, of, france, failed, in, his, conquest, of, italy, even, saying, how, he, could, have, succeeded, machiavelli, views, doing, harm, to, enemies, as, a, necessity, stating, if, an, injury, is, to, be, done, to, a, man, it, should, be, so, severe, that, the, prince, is, not, in, fear, of, revenge, in, some, cases, the, old, king, of, the, conquered, kingdom, depended, on, his, lords, 16th, century, france, or, in, other, words, france, as, it, was, at, the, time, of, writing, of, the, prince, is, given, by, machiavelli, as, an, example, of, such, a, kingdom, these, are, easy, to, enter, but, difficult, to, hold, when, the, kingdom, revolves, around, the, king, with, everyone, else, his, servant, then, it, is, difficult, to, enter, but, easy, to, hold, the, solution, is, to, eliminate, the, old, bloodline, of, the, prince, machiavelli, used, the, persian, empire, of, darius, iii, conquered, by, alexander, the, great, to, illustrate, this, point, and, then, noted, that, the, medici, if, they, think, about, it, will, find, this, historical, example, similar, to, the, kingdom, of, the, turk, ottoman, empire, in, their, time, making, this, a, potentially, easier, conquest, to, hold, than, france, would, be, gilbert, 1938, 34, notes, that, this, chapter, is, quite, atypical, of, any, previous, books, for, princes, gilbert, supposed, the, need, to, discuss, conquering, free, republics, is, linked, to, machiavelli, s, project, to, unite, italy, which, contained, some, free, republics, as, he, also, notes, the, chapter, in, any, case, makes, it, clear, that, holding, such, a, state, is, highly, difficult, for, a, prince, machiavelli, gives, three, options, machiavelli, advises, the, ruler, to, go, the, first, route, stating, that, if, a, prince, does, not, destroy, a, city, he, can, expect, to, be, destroyed, by, it, princes, who, rise, to, power, through, their, own, skill, and, resources, their, virtue, rather, than, luck, tend, to, have, a, hard, time, rising, to, the, top, but, once, they, reach, the, top, they, are, very, secure, in, their, position, this, is, because, they, effectively, crush, their, opponents, and, earn, great, respect, from, everyone, else, because, they, are, strong, and, more, self, sufficient, they, have, to, make, fewer, compromises, with, their, allies, machiavelli, writes, that, reforming, an, existing, order, is, one, of, the, most, dangerous, and, difficult, things, a, prince, can, do, part, of, the, reason, is, that, people, are, naturally, resistant, to, change, and, reform, those, who, benefited, from, the, old, order, will, resist, change, very, fiercely, and, those, who, may, stand, to, benefit, from, the, new, order, will, be, less, enthusiastic, in, their, support, because, the, new, order, is, unfamiliar, and, they, are, not, certain, it, will, live, up, to, its, promises, moreover, it, is, impossible, for, the, prince, to, satisfy, everybody, s, expectations, inevitably, he, will, disappoint, some, of, his, followers, therefore, a, prince, must, have, the, means, to, force, his, supporters, to, keep, supporting, him, even, when, they, start, having, second, thoughts, otherwise, he, will, lose, his, power, only, armed, prophets, like, moses, succeed, in, bringing, lasting, change, machiavelli, claims, that, moses, killed, uncountable, numbers, of, his, own, people, in, order, to, enforce, his, will, machiavelli, was, not, the, first, thinker, to, notice, this, pattern, allan, gilbert, wrote, in, wishing, new, laws, and, yet, seeing, danger, in, them, machiavelli, was, not, himself, an, innovator, because, this, idea, was, traditional, and, could, be, found, in, aristotle, s, writings, but, machiavelli, went, much, further, than, any, other, author, in, his, emphasis, on, this, aim, and, gilbert, associates, machiavelli, s, emphasis, upon, such, drastic, aims, with, the, level, of, corruption, to, be, found, in, italy, according, to, machiavelli, when, a, prince, comes, to, power, through, luck, or, the, blessings, of, powerful, figures, within, the, regime, he, typically, has, an, easy, time, gaining, power, but, a, hard, time, keeping, it, thereafter, because, his, power, is, dependent, on, his, benefactors, goodwill, he, does, not, command, the, loyalty, of, the, armies, and, officials, that, maintain, his, authority, and, these, can, be, withdrawn, from, him, at, a, whim, having, risen, the, easy, way, it, is, not, even, certain, such, a, prince, has, the, skill, and, strength, to, stand, on, his, own, feet, this, is, not, necessarily, true, in, every, case, machiavelli, cites, cesare, borgia, as, an, example, of, a, lucky, prince, who, escaped, this, pattern, through, cunning, political, maneuvers, he, managed, to, secure, his, power, base, cesare, was, made, commander, of, the, papal, armies, by, his, father, pope, alexander, vi, but, was, also, heavily, dependent, on, mercenary, armies, loyal, to, the, orsini, brothers, and, the, support, of, the, french, king, borgia, won, over, the, allegiance, of, the, orsini, brothers, followers, with, better, pay, and, prestigious, government, posts, to, pacify, the, romagna, he, sent, in, his, henchman, remirro, de, orco, to, commit, acts, of, violence, when, remirro, started, to, become, hated, for, his, actions, borgia, responded, by, ordering, him, to, be, cut, in, two, to, show, the, people, that, the, cruelty, was, not, from, him, although, it, was, when, some, of, his, mercenary, captains, started, to, plot, against, him, he, had, them, captured, and, executed, when, it, looked, as, though, the, king, of, france, would, abandon, him, borgia, sought, new, alliances, finally, machiavelli, makes, a, point, that, bringing, new, benefits, to, a, conquered, people, will, not, be, enough, to, cancel, the, memory, of, old, injuries, an, idea, allan, gilbert, said, can, be, found, in, tacitus, and, seneca, the, younger, conquests, by, criminal, virtue, are, ones, in, which, the, new, prince, secures, his, power, through, cruel, immoral, deeds, such, as, the, elimination, of, political, rivals, machiavelli, s, offers, two, rulers, to, imitate, agathocles, of, syracuse, and, oliverotto, euffreducci, after, agathocles, became, praetor, of, syracuse, he, called, a, meeting, of, the, city, s, elite, at, his, signal, his, soldiers, killed, all, the, senators, and, the, wealthiest, citizens, completely, destroying, the, old, oligarchy, he, declared, himself, ruler, with, no, opposition, so, secure, was, his, power, that, he, could, afford, to, absent, himself, to, go, off, on, military, campaigns, in, africa, machiavelli, then, states, that, the, behavior, of, agathocles, is, not, simply, virtue, as, he, says, yet, one, cannot, call, it, virtue, to, kill, one, s, citizens, betray, one, s, friends, to, be, without, faith, without, mercy, without, religion, these, modes, can, enable, one, to, acquire, empire, but, not, glory, nonetheless, his, savage, cruelty, and, inhumanity, together, with, his, infinite, crimes, do, not, permit, him, to, be, celebrated, among, the, most, excellent, men, thus, one, cannot, attribute, to, fortune, or, virtue, what, he, achieved, without, either, machiavelli, then, goes, to, his, next, example, oliverotto, de, fermo, an, italian, condottiero, who, recently, came, to, power, by, killing, all, his, enemies, including, his, uncle, giovanni, fogliani, at, a, banquet, after, he, laid, siege, to, the, governing, council, and, terrified, the, citizenry, he, had, then, set, up, a, government, with, himself, as, absolute, ruler, however, in, an, ironic, twist, oliverotto, was, killed, the, same, way, his, opponents, were, as, cesare, borgia, had, him, strangled, after, he, invited, oliverotto, and, vitellozzo, vitelli, to, a, friendly, setting, machiavelli, advises, that, a, prince, should, carefully, calculate, all, the, wicked, deeds, he, needs, to, do, to, secure, his, power, and, then, execute, them, all, in, one, stroke, in, this, way, his, subjects, will, slowly, forget, his, cruel, deeds, and, the, prince, can, better, align, himself, with, his, subjects, princes, who, fail, to, do, this, who, hesitate, in, their, ruthlessness, will, have, to, keep, a, knife, by, his, side, and, protect, himself, at, all, costs, as, he, can, never, trust, himself, amongst, his, subjects, gilbert, 1938, 51, 55, remarks, that, this, chapter, is, even, less, traditional, than, those, it, follows, not, only, in, its, treatment, of, criminal, behavior, but, also, in, the, advice, to, take, power, from, people, at, a, stroke, noting, that, precisely, the, opposite, had, been, advised, by, aristotle, in, his, politics, 5, 11, 1315a13, on, the, other, hand, gilbert, shows, that, another, piece, of, advice, in, this, chapter, to, give, benefits, when, it, will, not, appear, forced, was, traditional, a, civil, principality, is, one, in, which, a, citizen, comes, to, power, not, through, crime, or, other, intolerable, violence, but, by, the, support, of, his, fellow, citizens, this, he, says, does, not, require, extreme, virtue, or, fortune, only, fortunate, astuteness, for, this, is, one, of, the, four, means, of, coming, about, a, principality, the, other, three, being, by, virtue, fortune, and, criminality, machiavelli, makes, an, important, distinction, between, two, groups, that, are, present, in, every, city, and, have, very, different, appetites, driving, them, the, great, and, the, people, the, great, wish, to, oppress, and, rule, the, people, while, the, people, wish, not, to, be, ruled, or, oppressed, a, principality, is, not, the, only, outcome, possible, from, these, appetites, because, it, can, also, lead, to, either, liberty, or, license, a, principality, is, put, into, place, either, by, the, great, or, the, people, when, they, have, the, opportunity, to, take, power, but, find, resistance, from, the, other, side, they, assign, a, leader, who, can, be, popular, to, the, people, while, the, great, benefit, or, a, strong, authority, defending, the, people, against, the, great, machiavelli, goes, on, to, say, that, a, prince, who, obtains, power, through, the, support, of, the, nobles, has, a, harder, time, staying, in, power, than, someone, who, is, chosen, by, the, common, people, since, the, former, finds, himself, surrounded, by, people, who, consider, themselves, his, equals, he, has, to, resort, to, malevolent, measures, to, satisfy, the, nobles, one, cannot, by, fair, dealing, and, without, injury, to, others, satisfy, the, nobles, but, you, can, satisfy, the, people, for, their, object, is, more, righteous, than, that, of, the, nobles, the, latter, wishing, to, oppress, while, the, former, only, desire, not, to, be, oppressed, also, a, prince, cannot, afford, to, keep, the, common, people, hostile, as, they, are, larger, in, number, while, the, nobles, smaller, therefore, the, great, should, be, made, and, unmade, every, day, two, types, of, great, people, might, be, encountered, how, to, win, over, people, depends, on, circumstances, machiavelli, advises, the, way, to, judge, the, strength, of, a, princedom, is, to, see, whether, it, can, defend, itself, or, whether, it, needs, to, depend, on, allies, this, does, not, just, mean, that, the, cities, should, be, prepared, and, the, people, trained, a, prince, who, is, hated, is, also, exposed, this, type, of, principality, refers, explicitly, to, the, catholic, church, as, an, example, which, is, of, course, not, traditionally, thought, of, as, a, principality, according, to, machiavelli, these, are, relatively, easy, to, maintain, once, founded, they, do, not, need, to, defend, themselves, militarily, nor, to, govern, their, subjects, machiavelli, discusses, the, recent, history, of, the, church, as, if, it, were, a, princedom, that, was, in, competition, to, conquer, italy, against, other, princes, he, points, to, factionalism, as, a, historical, weak, point, in, the, church, and, points, to, the, recent, example, of, the, borgia, family, as, a, better, strategy, which, almost, worked, he, then, explicitly, proposes, that, the, medici, are, now, in, a, position, to, try, the, same, thing, having, discussed, the, various, types, of, principalities, machiavelli, turns, to, the, ways, a, state, can, attack, other, territories, or, defend, itself, the, two, most, essential, foundations, for, any, state, whether, old, or, new, are, sound, laws, and, strong, military, forces, a, self, sufficient, prince, is, one, who, can, meet, any, enemy, on, the, battlefield, he, should, be, armed, with, his, own, arms, however, a, prince, that, relies, solely, on, fortifications, or, on, the, help, of, others, and, stands, on, the, defensive, is, not, self, sufficient, if, he, cannot, raise, a, formidable, army, but, must, rely, on, defense, he, must, fortify, his, city, a, well, fortified, city, is, unlikely, to, be, attacked, and, if, it, is, most, armies, cannot, endure, an, extended, siege, however, during, a, siege, a, virtuous, prince, will, keep, the, morale, of, his, subjects, high, while, removing, all, dissenters, thus, as, long, as, the, city, is, properly, defended, and, has, enough, supplies, a, wise, prince, can, withstand, any, siege, machiavelli, stands, strongly, against, the, use, of, mercenaries, and, in, this, he, was, innovative, and, he, also, had, personal, experience, in, florence, he, believes, they, are, useless, to, a, ruler, because, they, are, undisciplined, cowardly, and, without, any, loyalty, being, motivated, only, by, money, machiavelli, attributes, the, italian, city, states, weakness, to, their, reliance, on, mercenary, armies, machiavelli, also, warns, against, using, auxiliary, forces, troops, borrowed, from, an, ally, because, if, they, win, the, employer, is, under, their, favor, and, if, they, lose, he, is, ruined, auxiliary, forces, are, more, dangerous, than, mercenary, forces, because, they, are, united, and, controlled, by, capable, leaders, who, may, turn, against, the, employer, the, main, concern, for, a, prince, should, be, war, or, the, preparation, thereof, not, books, through, war, a, hereditary, prince, maintains, his, power, or, a, private, citizen, rises, to, power, machiavelli, advises, that, a, prince, must, frequently, hunt, in, order, to, keep, his, body, fit, and, learn, the, landscape, surrounding, his, kingdom, through, this, he, can, best, learn, how, to, protect, his, territory, and, advance, upon, others, for, intellectual, strength, he, is, advised, to, study, great, military, men, so, he, may, imitate, their, successes, and, avoid, their, mistakes, a, prince, who, is, diligent, in, times, of, peace, will, be, ready, in, times, of, adversity, machiavelli, writes, thus, when, fortune, turns, against, him, he, will, be, prepared, to, resist, it, each, of, the, following, chapters, presents, a, discussion, about, a, particular, virtue, or, vice, that, a, prince, might, have, and, is, therefore, structured, in, a, way, which, appears, like, traditional, advice, for, a, prince, however, the, advice, is, far, from, traditional, machiavelli, believes, that, a, prince, s, main, focus, should, be, on, perfecting, the, art, of, war, he, believes, that, by, taking, this, profession, an, aspiring, prince, will, be, able, to, acquire, a, state, and, will, be, able, to, maintain, what, he, has, gained, he, claims, that, being, disarmed, makes, you, despised, he, believes, that, the, only, way, to, ensure, loyalty, from, one, s, soldiers, is, to, understand, military, matters, the, two, activities, machiavelli, recommends, practicing, to, prepare, for, war, are, physical, and, mental, physically, he, believes, rulers, should, learn, the, landscape, of, their, territories, mentally, he, encouraged, the, study, of, past, military, events, he, also, warns, against, idleness, because, says, machiavelli, he, wants, to, write, something, useful, to, those, who, understand, he, thought, it, more, fitting, to, go, directly, to, the, effectual, truth, verit, effettuale, of, the, thing, than, to, the, imagination, of, it, this, section, is, one, where, machiavelli, s, pragmatic, ideal, can, be, seen, most, clearly, machiavelli, reasons, that, since, princes, come, across, men, who, are, evil, he, should, learn, how, to, be, equally, evil, himself, and, use, this, ability, or, not, according, to, necessity, concerning, the, behavior, of, a, prince, toward, his, subjects, machiavelli, announces, that, he, will, depart, from, what, other, writers, say, and, writes, men, have, imagined, republics, and, principalities, that, never, really, existed, at, all, yet, the, way, men, live, is, so, far, removed, from, the, way, they, ought, to, live, that, anyone, who, abandons, what, is, for, what, should, be, pursues, his, downfall, rather, than, his, preservation, for, a, man, who, strives, after, goodness, in, all, his, acts, is, sure, to, come, to, ruin, since, there, are, so, many, men, who, are, not, good, since, there, are, many, possible, qualities, that, a, prince, can, be, said, to, possess, he, must, not, be, overly, concerned, about, having, all, the, good, ones, also, a, prince, may, be, perceived, to, be, merciful, faithful, humane, frank, and, religious, but, most, important, is, only, to, seem, to, have, these, qualities, a, prince, cannot, truly, have, these, qualities, because, at, times, it, is, necessary, to, act, against, them, although, a, bad, reputation, should, be, avoided, it, is, sometimes, necessary, to, have, one, in, fact, he, must, sometimes, deliberately, choose, evil, he, who, neglects, what, is, done, for, what, ought, to, be, done, sooner, effects, his, ruin, than, his, preservation, if, a, prince, is, overly, generous, to, his, subjects, machiavelli, asserts, he, will, not, be, appreciated, and, will, only, cause, greed, for, more, additionally, being, overly, generous, is, not, economical, because, eventually, all, resources, will, be, exhausted, this, results, in, higher, taxes, and, will, bring, grief, upon, the, prince, then, if, he, decides, to, discontinue, or, limit, his, generosity, he, will, be, labeled, as, a, miser, thus, machiavelli, summarizes, that, guarding, against, the, people, s, hatred, is, more, important, than, building, up, a, reputation, for, generosity, a, wise, prince, should, be, willing, to, be, more, reputed, a, miser, than, be, hated, for, trying, to, be, too, generous, on, the, other, hand, of, what, is, not, yours, or, your, subjects, one, can, be, a, bigger, giver, as, were, cyrus, caesar, and, alexander, because, spending, what, is, someone, else, s, does, not, take, reputation, from, you, but, adds, it, to, you, only, spending, your, own, hurts, you, machiavelli, begins, this, chapter, by, addressing, how, mercy, can, be, misused, which, will, harm, the, prince, and, his, dominion, he, ends, by, stating, that, a, prince, should, not, shrink, from, being, cruel, if, it, means, that, it, will, keep, his, subjects, in, line, after, all, it, will, help, him, maintain, his, rule, he, gives, the, example, of, cesare, borgia, whose, cruelty, protected, him, from, rebellions, he, does, not, contrast, this, example, with, the, leaders, of, florence, who, through, too, much, mercy, allowed, disorders, to, plague, their, city, in, addressing, the, question, of, whether, it, is, better, to, be, loved, or, feared, machiavelli, writes, the, answer, is, that, one, would, like, to, be, both, the, one, and, the, other, but, because, it, is, difficult, to, combine, them, it, is, far, safer, to, be, feared, than, loved, if, you, cannot, be, both, as, machiavelli, asserts, commitments, made, in, peace, are, not, always, kept, in, adversity, however, commitments, made, in, fear, are, kept, out, of, fear, yet, a, prince, must, ensure, that, he, is, not, feared, to, the, point, of, hatred, which, is, very, possible, this, chapter, is, possibly, the, most, well, known, of, the, work, and, it, is, important, because, of, the, reasoning, behind, machiavelli, s, famous, idea, that, it, is, better, to, be, feared, than, loved, his, justification, is, purely, pragmatic, as, he, notes, men, worry, less, about, doing, an, injury, to, one, who, makes, himself, loved, than, to, one, who, makes, himself, feared, fear, is, used, as, a, means, to, ensure, obedience, from, his, subjects, and, security, for, the, prince, above, all, machiavelli, argues, a, prince, should, not, interfere, with, the, property, of, their, subjects, or, their, women, and, if, they, should, try, to, kill, someone, they, should, do, it, with, a, convenient, justification, regarding, the, troops, of, the, prince, fear, is, absolutely, necessary, to, keep, a, large, garrison, united, and, a, prince, should, not, mind, the, thought, of, cruelty, in, that, regard, for, a, prince, who, leads, his, own, army, it, is, imperative, for, him, to, observe, cruelty, because, that, is, the, only, way, he, can, command, his, soldiers, absolute, respect, machiavelli, compares, two, great, military, leaders, hannibal, and, scipio, africanus, although, hannibal, s, army, consisted, of, men, of, various, races, they, were, never, rebellious, because, they, feared, their, leader, machiavelli, says, this, required, inhuman, cruelty, which, he, refers, to, as, a, virtue, scipio, s, men, on, the, other, hand, were, known, for, their, mutiny, and, dissension, due, to, scipio, s, excessive, mercy, which, was, however, a, source, of, glory, because, he, lived, in, a, republic, machiavelli, notes, that, a, prince, is, praised, for, keeping, his, word, however, he, also, notes, that, in, reality, the, most, cunning, princes, succeed, politically, a, prince, therefore, should, only, keep, his, word, when, it, suits, his, purposes, but, do, his, utmost, to, maintain, the, illusion, that, he, does, keep, his, word, and, that, he, is, reliable, in, that, regard, machiavelli, advises, the, ruler, to, become, a, great, liar, and, deceiver, and, that, men, are, so, easy, to, deceive, that, the, ruler, won, t, have, an, issue, with, lying, to, others, he, justifies, this, by, saying, that, men, are, wicked, and, never, keep, their, words, therefore, the, ruler, doesn, t, have, to, keep, his, as, machiavelli, notes, he, should, appear, to, be, compassionate, faithful, to, his, word, guileless, and, devout, and, indeed, he, should, be, so, but, his, disposition, should, be, such, that, if, he, needs, to, be, the, opposite, he, knows, how, as, noted, in, chapter, 15, the, prince, must, appear, to, be, virtuous, in, order, to, hide, his, actions, and, he, should, be, able, to, be, otherwise, when, the, time, calls, for, it, that, includes, being, able, to, lie, though, however, much, he, lies, he, should, always, keep, the, appearance, of, being, truthful, in, this, chapter, machiavelli, uses, beasts, as, a, metaphor, for, unscrupulous, behavior, he, states, that, while, lawful, conduct, is, part, of, the, nature, of, men, a, prince, should, learn, how, to, use, the, nature, of, both, men, and, beasts, wisely, to, ensure, the, stability, of, his, regime, in, this, chapter, however, his, focus, is, solely, on, the, beastly, natures, in, particular, he, compares, the, use, of, force, to, the, lion, and, the, use, of, deception, to, the, fox, and, advises, the, prince, to, study, them, both, in, employing, this, metaphor, machiavelli, apparently, references, de, officiis, by, the, roman, orator, and, statesman, cicero, and, subverts, its, conclusion, arguing, instead, that, dishonorable, behavior, is, sometimes, politically, necessary, machiavelli, divides, the, fears, which, monarchs, should, have, into, internal, domestic, and, external, foreign, fears, internal, fears, exist, inside, his, kingdom, and, focus, on, his, subjects, machiavelli, warns, to, be, suspicious, of, everyone, when, hostile, attitudes, emerge, machiavelli, observes, that, the, majority, of, men, are, content, as, long, as, they, are, not, deprived, of, their, property, and, women, and, only, a, minority, of, men, are, ambitious, enough, to, be, a, concern, a, prince, should, command, respect, through, his, conduct, because, a, prince, who, raises, no, contempt, of, the, nobles, and, maintains, the, satisfaction, of, the, people, machiavelli, assures, should, have, no, fear, of, conspirators, working, with, external, powers, conspiracy, is, very, difficult, and, risky, in, such, a, situation, machiavelli, apparently, seems, to, go, back, on, his, rule, that, a, prince, can, evade, hate, as, he, says, that, he, will, eventually, be, hated, by, someone, so, he, should, seek, to, avoid, being, hated, by, the, commonfolk, roman, emperors, on, the, other, hand, had, not, only, the, majority, and, ambitious, minority, but, also, a, cruel, and, greedy, military, who, created, extra, problems, as, they, demanded, iniquity, while, a, prince, should, avoid, being, hated, he, will, eventually, be, hated, by, someone, so, he, must, at, least, avoid, the, hatred, of, the, most, powerful, and, for, the, roman, emperors, this, included, the, military, who, demanded, iniquity, against, the, people, out, of, their, own, greed, he, uses, septimius, severus, as, a, model, for, new, rulers, to, emulate, as, he, embodied, both, the, fox, and, the, lion, severus, outwitted, and, killed, his, military, rivals, and, although, he, oppressed, the, people, machiavelli, says, that, he, kept, the, common, people, satisfied, and, stupified, machiavelli, notes, that, in, his, time, only, the, turkish, empire, had, the, problem, of, the, romans, because, in, other, lands, the, people, had, become, more, powerful, than, the, military, machiavelli, mentions, that, placing, fortresses, in, conquered, territories, although, it, sometimes, works, often, fails, using, fortresses, can, be, a, good, plan, but, machiavelli, says, he, shall, blame, anyone, who, trusting, in, fortresses, thinks, little, of, being, hated, by, the, people, he, cited, caterina, sforza, who, used, a, fortress, to, defend, herself, but, was, eventually, betrayed, by, her, people, a, prince, truly, earns, honour, by, completing, great, feats, king, ferdinand, of, spain, is, cited, by, machiavelli, as, an, example, of, a, monarch, who, gained, esteem, by, showing, his, ability, through, great, feats, and, who, in, the, name, of, religion, conquered, many, territories, and, kept, his, subjects, occupied, so, that, they, had, no, chance, to, rebel, regarding, two, warring, states, machiavelli, asserts, it, is, always, wiser, to, choose, a, side, rather, than, to, be, neutral, machiavelli, then, provides, the, following, reasons, why, machiavelli, also, notes, that, it, is, wise, for, a, prince, not, to, ally, with, a, stronger, force, unless, compelled, to, do, so, in, conclusion, the, most, important, virtue, is, having, the, wisdom, to, discern, what, ventures, will, come, with, the, most, reward, and, then, pursuing, them, courageously, the, selection, of, good, servants, is, reflected, directly, upon, the, prince, s, intelligence, so, if, they, are, loyal, the, prince, is, considered, wise, however, when, they, are, otherwise, the, prince, is, open, to, adverse, criticism, machiavelli, asserts, that, there, are, three, types, of, intelligence, if, the, prince, does, not, have, the, first, type, of, intelligence, he, should, at, the, very, least, have, the, second, type, for, as, machiavelli, states, a, prince, needs, to, have, the, discernment, to, recognize, the, good, or, bad, in, what, another, says, or, does, even, though, he, has, no, acumen, himself, this, chapter, displays, a, low, opinion, of, flatterers, machiavelli, notes, that, men, are, so, happily, absorbed, in, their, own, affairs, and, indulge, in, such, self, deception, that, it, is, difficult, for, them, not, to, fall, victim, to, this, plague, and, some, efforts, to, protect, oneself, from, flatterers, involve, the, risk, of, becoming, despised, flatterers, were, seen, as, a, great, danger, to, a, prince, because, their, flattery, could, cause, him, to, avoid, wise, counsel, in, favor, of, rash, action, but, avoiding, all, advice, flattery, or, otherwise, was, equally, bad, a, middle, road, had, to, be, taken, a, prudent, prince, should, have, a, select, group, of, wise, counselors, to, advise, him, truthfully, on, matters, all, the, time, all, their, opinions, should, be, taken, into, account, ultimately, the, decision, should, be, made, by, the, prince, and, carried, out, absolutely, if, a, prince, is, given, to, changing, his, mind, his, reputation, will, suffer, a, prince, must, have, the, wisdom, to, recognize, good, advice, from, bad, machiavelli, gives, a, negative, example, in, emperor, maximilian, i, maximilian, who, was, secretive, never, consulted, others, but, once, he, ordered, his, plans, and, met, dissent, he, immediately, changed, them, after, first, mentioning, that, a, new, prince, can, quickly, become, as, respected, as, a, hereditary, one, machiavelli, says, princes, in, italy, who, had, longstanding, power, and, lost, it, cannot, blame, bad, luck, but, should, blame, their, own, indolence, one, should, never, fall, in, the, belief, that, you, can, find, someone, to, pick, you, up, they, all, showed, a, defect, of, arms, already, discussed, and, either, had, a, hostile, populace, or, did, not, know, to, secure, themselves, against, the, great, as, pointed, out, by, gilbert, 1938, 206, it, was, traditional, in, the, genre, of, mirrors, of, princes, to, mention, fortune, but, fortune, pervades, the, prince, as, she, does, no, other, similar, work, machiavelli, argues, that, fortune, is, only, the, judge, of, half, of, our, actions, and, that, we, have, control, over, the, other, half, with, sweat, prudence, and, virtue, even, more, unusual, rather, than, simply, suggesting, caution, as, a, prudent, way, to, try, to, avoid, the, worst, of, bad, luck, machiavelli, holds, that, the, greatest, princes, in, history, tend, to, be, ones, who, take, more, risks, and, rise, to, power, through, their, own, labour, virtue, prudence, and, particularly, by, their, ability, to, adapt, to, changing, circumstances, machiavelli, even, encourages, risk, taking, as, a, reaction, to, risk, in, a, well, known, metaphor, machiavelli, writes, that, it, is, better, to, be, impetuous, than, cautious, because, fortune, is, a, woman, and, it, is, necessary, if, one, wants, to, hold, her, down, to, beat, her, and, strike, her, down, gilbert, p, 217, points, out, that, machiavelli, s, friend, the, historian, and, diplomat, francesco, guicciardini, expressed, similar, ideas, about, fortune, machiavelli, compares, fortune, to, a, torrential, river, that, cannot, be, easily, controlled, during, flooding, season, in, periods, of, calm, however, people, can, erect, dams, and, levees, in, order, to, minimize, its, impact, fortune, machiavelli, argues, seems, to, strike, at, the, places, where, no, resistance, is, offered, as, had, recently, been, the, case, in, italy, as, de, alvarez, 1999, 125, 30, points, out, that, what, machiavelli, actually, says, is, that, italians, in, his, time, leave, things, not, just, to, fortune, but, to, fortune, and, god, machiavelli, is, indicating, in, this, passage, as, in, some, others, in, his, works, that, christianity, itself, was, making, italians, helpless, and, lazy, concerning, their, own, politics, as, if, they, would, leave, dangerous, rivers, uncontrolled, pope, leo, x, was, pope, at, the, time, the, book, was, written, and, a, member, of, the, medici, family, this, chapter, directly, appeals, to, the, medici, to, use, what, has, been, summarized, in, order, to, conquer, italy, using, italian, armies, following, the, advice, in, the, book, gilbert, 1938, 222, 30, showed, that, including, such, exhortation, was, not, unusual, in, the, genre, of, books, full, of, advice, for, princes, but, it, is, unusual, that, the, medici, family, s, position, of, papal, power, is, openly, named, as, something, that, should, be, used, as, a, personal, power, base, as, a, tool, of, secular, politics, indeed, one, example, is, the, borgia, family, s, recent, and, controversial, attempts, to, use, church, power, in, secular, politics, often, brutally, executed, this, continues, a, controversial, theme, throughout, the, book, as, shown, by, his, letter, of, dedication, machiavelli, s, work, eventually, came, to, be, dedicated, to, lorenzo, di, piero, de, medici, grandson, of, lorenzo, the, magnificent, and, a, member, of, the, ruling, florentine, medici, family, whose, uncle, giovanni, became, pope, leo, x, in, 1513, it, is, known, from, his, personal, correspondence, that, it, was, written, during, 1513, the, year, after, the, medici, regained, control, of, florence, and, a, few, months, after, machiavelli, s, arrest, torture, and, banishment, by, the, in, coming, medici, regime, it, was, discussed, for, a, long, time, with, francesco, vettori, a, friend, of, machiavelli, whom, he, wanted, to, pass, it, and, commend, it, to, the, medici, the, book, had, originally, been, intended, for, giuliano, di, lorenzo, de, medici, young, lorenzo, s, uncle, who, however, died, in, 1516, it, is, not, certain, that, the, work, was, ever, read, by, any, of, the, medici, before, it, was, printed, machiavelli, describes, the, contents, as, being, an, un, embellished, summary, of, his, knowledge, about, the, nature, of, princes, and, the, actions, of, great, men, based, not, only, on, reading, but, also, unusually, on, real, experience, the, types, of, political, behavior, which, are, discussed, with, apparent, approval, by, machiavelli, in, the, prince, were, regarded, as, shocking, by, contemporaries, and, its, immorality, is, still, a, subject, of, serious, discussion, although, the, work, advises, princes, how, to, tyrannize, machiavelli, is, generally, thought, to, have, preferred, some, form, of, republican, government, some, commentators, justify, his, acceptance, of, immoral, and, criminal, actions, by, leaders, by, arguing, that, he, lived, during, a, time, of, continuous, political, conflict, and, instability, in, italy, and, that, his, influence, has, increased, the, pleasures, equality, and, freedom, of, many, people, loosening, the, grip, of, medieval, catholicism, s, classical, teleology, which, disregarded, not, only, the, needs, of, individuals, and, the, wants, of, the, common, man, but, stifled, innovation, enterprise, and, enquiry, into, cause, and, effect, relationships, that, now, allow, us, to, control, nature, on, the, other, hand, strauss, 1958, 11, notes, that, even, if, we, were, forced, to, grant, that, machiavelli, was, essentially, a, patriot, or, a, scientist, we, would, not, be, forced, to, deny, that, he, was, a, teacher, of, evil, furthermore, machiavelli, was, too, thoughtful, not, to, know, what, he, was, doing, and, too, generous, not, to, admit, it, to, his, reasonable, friends, machiavelli, emphasized, the, need, for, looking, at, the, effectual, truth, verita, effetuale, as, opposed, to, relying, on, imagined, republics, and, principalities, he, states, the, difference, between, honorable, behavior, and, criminal, behavior, by, using, the, metaphor, of, animals, saying, that, there, are, two, ways, of, contending, one, in, accordance, with, the, laws, the, other, by, force, the, first, of, which, is, proper, to, men, the, second, to, beast, in, the, prince, he, does, not, explain, what, he, thinks, the, best, ethical, or, political, goals, are, except, the, control, of, one, s, own, fortune, as, opposed, to, waiting, to, see, what, chance, brings, machiavelli, took, it, for, granted, that, would, be, leaders, naturally, aim, at, glory, or, honour, he, associated, these, goals, with, a, need, for, virtue, and, prudence, in, a, leader, and, saw, such, virtues, as, essential, to, good, politics, that, great, men, should, develop, and, use, their, virtue, and, prudence, was, a, traditional, theme, of, advice, to, christian, princes, and, that, more, virtue, meant, less, reliance, on, chance, was, a, classically, influenced, humanist, commonplace, in, machiavelli, s, time, as, fischer, 2000, 75, says, even, if, it, was, somewhat, controversial, however, machiavelli, went, far, beyond, other, authors, in, his, time, who, in, his, opinion, left, things, to, fortune, and, therefore, to, bad, rulers, because, of, their, christian, beliefs, he, used, the, words, virtue, and, prudence, to, refer, to, glory, seeking, and, spirited, excellence, of, character, in, strong, contrast, to, the, traditional, christian, uses, of, those, terms, but, more, keeping, with, the, original, pre, christian, greek, and, roman, concepts, from, which, they, derived, he, encouraged, ambition, and, risk, taking, so, in, another, break, with, tradition, he, treated, not, only, stability, but, also, radical, innovation, as, possible, aims, of, a, prince, in, a, political, community, managing, major, reforms, can, show, off, a, prince, s, virtue, and, give, him, glory, he, clearly, felt, italy, needed, major, reform, in, his, time, and, this, opinion, of, his, time, is, widely, shared, machiavelli, s, descriptions, encourage, leaders, to, attempt, to, control, their, fortune, gloriously, to, the, extreme, extent, that, some, situations, may, call, for, a, fresh, founding, or, re, founding, of, the, modes, and, orders, that, define, a, community, despite, the, danger, and, necessary, evil, and, lawlessness, of, such, a, project, founding, a, wholly, new, state, or, even, a, new, religion, using, injustice, and, immorality, has, even, been, called, the, chief, theme, of, the, prince, machiavelli, justifies, this, position, by, explaining, how, if, a, prince, did, not, win, love, he, may, escape, hate, by, personifying, injustice, and, immorality, therefore, he, will, never, loosen, his, grip, since, fear, is, held, by, the, apprehension, of, punishment, and, never, diminishes, as, time, goes, by, for, a, political, theorist, to, do, this, in, public, was, one, of, machiavelli, s, clearest, breaks, not, just, with, medieval, scholasticism, but, with, the, classical, tradition, of, political, philosophy, especially, the, favorite, philosopher, of, catholicism, at, the, time, aristotle, this, is, one, of, machiavelli, s, most, lasting, influences, upon, modernity, nevertheless, machiavelli, was, heavily, influenced, by, classical, pre, christian, political, philosophy, according, to, strauss, 1958, 291, machiavelli, refers, to, xenophon, more, than, plato, aristotle, and, cicero, put, together, xenophon, wrote, one, of, the, classic, mirrors, of, princes, the, education, of, cyrus, gilbert, 1938, 236, wrote, the, cyrus, of, xenophon, was, a, hero, to, many, a, literary, man, of, the, sixteenth, century, but, for, machiavelli, he, lived, xenophon, also, as, strauss, pointed, out, wrote, a, dialogue, hiero, which, showed, a, wise, man, dealing, sympathetically, with, a, tyrant, coming, close, to, what, machiavelli, would, do, in, uprooting, the, ideal, of, the, imagined, prince, xenophon, however, like, plato, and, aristotle, was, a, follower, of, socrates, and, his, works, show, approval, of, a, teleological, argument, while, machiavelli, rejected, such, arguments, on, this, matter, strauss, 1958, 222, 23, gives, evidence, that, machiavelli, may, have, seen, himself, as, having, learned, something, from, democritus, epicurus, and, classical, materialism, which, was, however, not, associated, with, political, realism, or, even, any, interest, in, politics, on, the, topic, of, rhetoric, machiavelli, in, his, introduction, stated, that, i, have, not, embellished, or, crammed, this, book, with, rounded, periods, or, big, impressive, words, or, with, any, blandishment, or, superfluous, decoration, of, the, kind, which, many, are, in, the, habit, of, using, to, describe, or, adorn, what, they, have, produced, this, has, been, interpreted, as, showing, a, distancing, from, traditional, rhetoric, styles, but, there, are, echoes, of, classical, rhetoric, in, several, areas, in, chapter, 18, for, example, he, uses, a, metaphor, of, a, lion, and, a, fox, examples, of, force, and, cunning, according, to, zerba, 2004, 217, the, roman, author, from, whom, machiavelli, in, all, likelihood, drew, the, simile, of, the, lion, and, the, fox, was, cicero, the, rhetorica, ad, herennium, a, work, which, was, believed, during, machiavelli, s, time, to, have, been, written, by, cicero, was, used, widely, to, teach, rhetoric, and, it, is, likely, that, machiavelli, was, familiar, with, it, unlike, cicero, s, more, widely, accepted, works, however, according, to, cox, 1997, 1122, ad, herennium, offers, a, model, of, an, ethical, system, that, not, only, condones, the, practice, of, force, and, deception, but, appears, to, regard, them, as, habitual, and, indeed, germane, to, political, activity, this, makes, it, an, ideal, text, for, machiavelli, to, have, used, to, quote, bireley, 1990, 14, there, were, in, circulation, approximately, fifteen, editions, of, the, prince, and, nineteen, of, the, discourses, and, french, translations, of, each, before, they, were, placed, on, the, index, of, paul, iv, in, 1559, a, measure, which, nearly, stopped, publication, in, catholic, areas, except, in, france, three, principal, writers, took, the, field, against, machiavelli, between, the, publication, of, his, works, and, their, condemnation, in, 1559, and, again, by, the, tridentine, index, in, 1564, these, were, the, english, cardinal, reginald, pole, and, the, portuguese, bishop, jer, nimo, os, rio, both, of, whom, lived, for, many, years, in, italy, and, the, italian, humanist, and, later, bishop, ambrogio, caterino, politi, machiavelli, s, ideas, on, how, to, accrue, honour, and, power, as, a, leader, had, a, profound, impact, on, political, leaders, throughout, the, modern, west, helped, by, the, new, technology, of, the, printing, press, pole, reported, that, it, was, spoken, of, highly, by, his, enemy, thomas, cromwell, in, england, and, had, influenced, henry, viii, in, his, turn, towards, protestantism, and, in, his, tactics, for, example, during, the, pilgrimage, of, grace, a, copy, was, also, possessed, by, the, catholic, king, and, emperor, charles, v, in, france, after, an, initially, mixed, reaction, machiavelli, came, to, be, associated, with, catherine, de, medici, and, the, st, bartholomew, s, day, massacre, as, bireley, 1990, 17, reports, in, the, 16th, century, catholic, writers, associated, machiavelli, with, the, protestants, whereas, protestant, authors, saw, him, as, italian, and, catholic, in, fact, he, was, apparently, influencing, both, catholic, and, protestant, kings, one, of, the, most, important, early, works, dedicated, to, criticism, of, machiavelli, especially, the, prince, was, that, of, the, huguenot, innocent, gentillet, discourse, against, machiavelli, commonly, also, referred, to, as, anti, machiavel, published, in, geneva, in, 1576, he, accused, machiavelli, of, being, an, atheist, and, accused, politicians, of, his, time, by, saying, that, they, treated, his, works, as, the, koran, of, the, courtiers, another, theme, of, gentillet, was, more, in, the, spirit, of, machiavelli, himself, he, questioned, the, effectiveness, of, immoral, strategies, just, as, machiavelli, had, himself, done, despite, also, explaining, how, they, could, sometimes, work, this, became, the, theme, of, much, future, political, discourse, in, europe, during, the, 17th, century, this, includes, the, catholic, counter, reformation, writers, summarised, by, bireley, giovanni, botero, justus, lipsius, carlo, scribani, adam, contzen, pedro, de, ribadeneira, and, diego, de, saavedra, fajardo, these, authors, criticized, machiavelli, but, also, followed, him, in, many, ways, they, accepted, the, need, for, a, prince, to, be, concerned, with, reputation, and, even, a, need, for, cunning, and, deceit, but, compared, to, machiavelli, and, like, later, modernist, writers, they, emphasized, economic, progress, much, more, than, the, riskier, ventures, of, war, these, authors, tended, to, cite, tacitus, as, their, source, for, realist, political, advice, rather, than, machiavelli, and, this, pretense, came, to, be, known, as, tacitism, modern, materialist, philosophy, developed, in, the, 16th, 17th, and, 18th, century, starting, in, the, generations, after, machiavelli, the, importance, of, machiavelli, s, realism, was, noted, by, many, important, figures, in, this, endeavor, for, example, jean, bodin, francis, bacon, harrington, john, milton, spinoza, rousseau, hume, edward, gibbon, and, adam, smith, although, he, was, not, always, mentioned, by, name, as, an, inspiration, due, to, his, controversy, he, is, also, thought, to, have, been, an, influence, for, other, major, philosophers, such, as, montaigne, descartes, hobbes, locke, and, montesquieu, in, literature, amongst, later, political, leaders, 20th, century, italian, american, mobsters, were, influenced, by, the, prince, john, gotti, and, roy, demeo, would, regularly, quote, the, prince, and, consider, it, to, be, the, mafia, bible, rapper, tupac, shakur, studied, in, depth, the, teachings, of, the, prince, while, in, prison, recovering, from, an, attempt, on, his, life, and, was, so, inspired, by, it, that, once, released, from, prison, he, changed, his, stage, name, to, a, pseudonym, makaveli, stating, like, machiavelli, my, name, is, not, machiavelli, my, name, is, makaveli, i, took, it, that, s, mine, he, gave, me, that, and, i, don, t, feel, no, guilt, that, s, what, got, me, here, my, reading, it, s, not, like, i, idolize, this, one, guy, machiavelli, i, idolize, that, type, of, thinking, where, you, do, whatever, s, gonna, make, you, achieve, your, goal, only, eight, weeks, after, tupac, shakur, died, from, gunshot, wounds, death, row, records, released, the, don, killuminati, the, 7, day, theory, the, posthumous, album, under, the, name, of, makaveli, this, interpretation, was, famously, put, forth, by, scholar, garrett, mattingly, 1958, who, stated, that, in, some, ways, machiavelli, s, little, treatise, was, just, like, all, the, other, mirrors, of, princes, in, other, ways, it, was, a, diabolical, burlesque, of, all, of, them, like, a, political, black, mass, this, position, was, taken, up, previously, by, some, of, the, more, prominent, enlightenment, philosophes, diderot, speculated, that, it, was, a, work, designed, not, to, mock, but, to, secretly, expose, corrupt, princely, rule, and, in, his, the, social, contract, the, french, philosopher, jean, jacques, rousseau, said, machiavelli, was, a, proper, man, and, a, good, citizen, but, being, attached, to, the, court, of, the, medici, he, could, not, help, veiling, his, love, of, liberty, in, the, midst, of, his, country, s, oppression, the, choice, of, his, detestable, hero, cesare, borgia, clearly, enough, shows, his, hidden, aim, and, the, contradiction, between, the, teaching, of, the, prince, and, that, of, the, discourses, on, livy, and, the, history, of, florence, shows, that, this, profound, political, thinker, has, so, far, been, studied, only, by, superficial, or, corrupt, readers, the, court, of, rome, sternly, prohibited, his, book, i, can, well, believe, it, for, it, is, that, court, it, most, clearly, portrays, whether, or, not, the, word, satire, is, the, best, choice, the, interpretation, is, very, rare, amongst, those, who, study, machiavelli, s, works, for, example, isaiah, berlin, states, that, he, cannot, find, anything, other, than, machiavelli, s, work, that, reads, less, like, a, satirical, piece, mary, dietz, in, her, essay, trapping, the, prince, writes, that, machiavelli, s, agenda, was, not, to, be, satirical, as, rousseau, had, argued, but, instead, was, offering, carefully, crafted, advice, such, as, arming, the, people, designed, to, undo, the, ruler, if, taken, seriously, and, followed, by, this, account, the, aim, was, to, reestablish, the, republic, in, florence, she, focuses, on, three, categories, in, which, machiavelli, gives, paradoxical, advice, according, to, dietz, the, trap, never, succeeded, because, lorenzo, a, suspicious, prince, apparently, never, read, the, work, of, the, former, republican, the, italian, marxist, philosopher, antonio, gramsci, argued, that, machiavelli, s, audience, for, this, work, was, not, the, classes, who, already, rule, or, have, hegemony, over, the, common, people, but, the, common, people, themselves, trying, to, establish, a, new, hegemony, and, making, machiavelli, the, first, italian, jacobin, hans, baron, is, one, of, the, few, major, commentators, who, argues, that, machiavelli, must, have, changed, his, mind, dramatically, in, favour, of, free, republics, after, having, written,
