and, misfortune, that, the, buend, a, family, s, generations, lived, through, as, aureliano, reads, the, manuscript, he, feels, a, windstorm, starting, around, him, and, he, reads, in, the, document, that, the, buend, a, family, is, doomed, to, be, wiped, from, the, face, of, the, earth, because, of, it, in, the, last, sentence, of, the, book, the, narrator, describes, aureliano, reading, this, last, line, just, as, the, entire, town, of, macondo, is, scoured, from, existence, a, dominant, theme, in, one, hundred, years, of, solitude, is, the, inevitable, and, inescapable, repetition, of, history, in, macondo, the, protagonists, are, controlled, by, their, pasts, and, the, complexity, of, time, throughout, the, novel, the, characters, are, visited, by, ghosts, the, ghosts, are, symbols, of, the, past, and, the, haunting, nature, it, has, over, macondo, the, ghosts, and, the, displaced, repetition, that, they, evoke, are, in, fact, firmly, grounded, in, the, particular, development, of, latin, american, history, writes, daniel, erickson, ideological, transfiguration, ensured, that, macondo, and, the, buend, as, always, were, ghosts, to, some, extent, alienated, and, estranged, from, their, own, history, not, only, victims, of, the, harsh, reality, of, dependence, and, underdevelopment, but, also, of, the, ideological, illusions, that, haunt, and, reinforce, such, social, conditions, the, fate, of, macondo, is, both, doomed, and, predetermined, from, its, very, existence, fatalism, is, a, metaphor, for, the, particular, part, that, ideology, has, played, in, maintaining, historical, dependence, by, locking, the, interpretation, of, latin, american, history, into, certain, patterns, that, deny, alternative, possibilities, the, narrative, seemingly, confirms, fatalism, in, order, to, illustrate, the, feeling, of, entrapment, that, ideology, can, performatively, create, garc, a, m, rquez, uses, colours, as, symbols, yellow, and, gold, are, the, most, frequently, used, and, symbolize, imperialism, and, the, spanish, siglo, de, oro, gold, signifies, a, search, for, economic, wealth, whereas, yellow, represents, death, change, and, destruction, the, glass, city, is, an, image, that, comes, to, jos, arcadio, buend, a, in, a, dream, it, is, the, reason, for, macondo, s, location, but, also, a, symbol, of, its, fate, higgins, writes, by, the, final, page, however, the, city, of, mirrors, has, become, a, city, of, mirages, macondo, thus, represents, the, dream, of, a, brave, new, world, that, america, seemed, to, promise, and, that, was, cruelly, proved, illusory, by, the, subsequent, course, of, history, images, such, as, the, glass, city, and, the, ice, factory, represent, how, latin, america, already, has, its, history, outlined, and, is, therefore, fated, for, destruction, there, is, an, underlying, pattern, of, latin, american, history, in, one, hundred, years, of, solitude, it, has, been, said, that, the, novel, is, one, of, a, number, of, texts, that, latin, american, culture, has, created, to, understand, itself, in, this, sense, the, novel, can, be, conceived, as, a, linear, archive, that, narrates, the, story, of, a, latin, america, discovered, by, european, explorers, which, had, its, historical, entity, developed, by, the, printing, press, the, archive, is, a, symbol, of, the, literature, that, is, the, foundation, of, latin, american, history, and, also, a, decoding, instrument, melqu, ades, the, keeper, of, the, archive, represents, both, the, whimsical, and, the, literary, finally, the, world, of, one, hundred, years, of, solitude, is, a, place, where, beliefs, and, metaphors, become, forms, of, fact, and, where, more, ordinary, facts, become, uncertain, the, use, of, particular, historic, events, and, characters, renders, one, hundred, years, of, solitude, an, exemplary, work, of, magical, realism, wherein, the, novel, compresses, decades, of, cause, and, effect, whilst, telling, an, interesting, story, jos, arcadio, buend, a, is, the, patriarch, of, the, buend, a, family, and, the, founder, of, macondo, buend, a, leaves, his, hometown, in, riohacha, municipality, colombia, along,

gerineldo, m, rquez, he, and, aureliano, babilonia, are, close, friends, because, they, know, the, history, of, the, town, which, no, one, else, believes, he, leaves, for, paris, after, winning, a, contest, and, decides, to, stay, there, selling, old, newspapers, and, empty, bottles, he, is, one, of, the, few, who, is, able, to, leave, macondo, before, the, town, is, wiped, out, entirely, the, rise, and, fall, birth, and, death, of, the, mythical, but, intensely, real, macondo, and, the, glories, and, disasters, of, the, wonderful, buend, a, family, make, up, an, intensely, brilliant, chronicle, of, humankind, s, comedies, and, tragedies, all, the, many, varieties, of, life, are, captured, here, inventively, amusingly, magnetically, sadly, humorously, luminously, truthfully, critics, often, cite, certain, works, by, garc, a, m, rquez, such, as, a, very, old, man, with, enormous, wings, and, one, hundred, years, of, solitude, as, exemplary, of, magic, realism, a, style, of, writing, in, which, the, supernatural, is, presented, as, mundane, and, the, mundane, as, supernatural, or, extraordinary, the, term, was, coined, by, german, art, critic, franz, roh, in, 1925, the, novel, presents, a, fictional, story, in, a, fictional, setting, the, extraordinary, events, and, characters, are, fabricated, yet, garc, a, m, rquez, uses, his, fantastic, story, as, an, expression, of, reality, in, one, hundred, years, of, solitude, myth, and, history, overlap, the, myth, acts, as, a, vehicle, to, transmit, history, to, the, reader, garc, a, m, rquez, s, novel, could, also, be, referred, to, as, anthropology, where, truth, is, found, in, language, and, myth, the, real, and, the, fiction, are, indistinguishable, there, are, three, main, mythical, elements, of, the, novel, classical, stories, alluding, to, foundations, and, origins, characters, resembling, mythical, heroes, and, supernatural, elements, magic, realism, is, achieved, by, the, constant, intertwining, of, the, ordinary, with, the, extraordinary, this, magic, realism, strikes, at, one, s, traditional, sense, of, naturalistic, fiction, there, is, something, clearly, magical, about, the, world, of, macondo, it, is, a, state, of, mind, as, much, as, or, more, than, a, geographical, place, for, example, one, learns, very, little, about, its, actual, physical, layout, furthermore, once, in, it, the, reader, must, be, prepared, to, meet, whatever, the, imagination, of, the, author, presents, to, them, garc, a, m, rquez, blends, the, real, with, the, magical, through, the, use, of, tone, and, narration, by, maintaining, the, same, tone, throughout, the, novel, garc, a, m, rquez, makes, the, extraordinary, blend, with, the, ordinary, his, condensation, of, events, and, lackadaisical, manner, in, describing, them, causes, the, extraordinary, to, seem, less, remarkable, than, it, actually, is, further, blending, the, real, with, the, magical, reinforcing, this, effect, is, the, unastonished, tone, in, which, the, book, is, written, this, tone, restricts, the, ability, of, the, reader, to, question, the, events, of, the, novel, however, it, also, causes, the, reader, to, call, into, question, the, limits, of, reality, furthermore, maintaining, the, same, narrator, throughout, the, novel, familiarizes, the, reader, with, his, voice, and, causes, them, to, become, accustomed, to, the, extraordinary, events, in, the, novel, throughout, the, novel, garc, a, m, rquez, is, said, to, have, a, gift, for, blending, the, everyday, with, the, miraculous, the, historical, with, the, fabulous, and, psychological, realism, with, surreal, flights, of, fancy, it, is, a, revolutionary, novel, that, provides, a, looking, glass, into, the, thoughts, and, beliefs, of, its, author, who, chose, to, give, a, literary, voice, to, latin, america, a, latin, america, which, neither, wants, nor, has, any, reason, to, be, a, pawn, without, a, will, of, its, own, nor, is, it, merely, wishful, thinking, that, its, quest, for, independence, and, originality, should, become, a, western, aspiration, although, we, are, faced, with, a, very, convoluted, narrative, garc, a, m, rquez, is, able, to, define, clear, themes, while, maintaining, individual, character, identities, and, using, different, narrative, techniques, such, as, third, person, narrators, specific, point, of, view, narrators, and, streams, of, consciousness, cinematographic, techniques, are, also, employed, in, the, novel, with, the, idea, of, the, montage, and, the, close, up, which, effectively, combine, the, comic, and, grotesque, with, the, dramatic, and, tragic, furthermore, political, and, historical, realities, are, combined, with, the, mythical, and, magical, latin, american, world, lastly, through, human, comedy, the, problems, of, a, family, a, town, and, a, country, are, unveiled, this, is, all, presented, through, garc, a, m, rquez, s, unique, form, of, narration, which, causes, the, novel, to, never, cease, being, at, its, most, interesting, point, perhaps, the, most, dominant, theme, in, the, book, is, that, of, solitude, macondo, was, founded, in, the, remote, jungles, of, the, colombian, rainforest, the, solitude, of, the, town, is, representative, of, the, colonial, period, in, latin, american, history, where, outposts, and, colonies, were, for, all, intents, and, purposes, not, interconnected, isolated, from, the, rest, of, the, world, the, buend, as, grow, to, be, increasingly, solitary, and, selfish, with, every, member, of, the, family, living, only, for, him, or, her, self, the, buend, as, become, representative, of, the, aristocratic, land, owning, elite, who, came, to, dominate, latin, america, in, keeping, with, the, sense, of, latin, american, history, symbolized, in, the, novel, this, egocentricity, is, embodied, especially, in, the, characters, of, aureliano, who, lives, in, a, private, world, of, his, own, and, remedios, the, beauty, who, innocently, destroys, the, lives, of, four, men, enamored, by, her, unbelievable, beauty, because, she, is, living, in, a, different, reality, due, to, what, some, see, as, autism, throughout, the, novel, it, seems, as, if, no, character, can, find, true, love, or, escape, the, destructiveness, of, their, own, egocentricity, the, selfishness, of, the, buend, a, family, is, eventually, broken, by, the, once, superficial, aureliano, segundo, and, petra, cotes, who, discover, a, sense, of, mutual, solidarity, and, the, joy, of, helping, others, in, need, during, macondo, s, economic, crisis, the, pair, even, find, love, and, their, pattern, is, repeated, by, aureliano, babilonia, and, amaranta, rsula, eventually, aureliano, and, amaranta, rsula, have, a, child, and, the, latter, is, convinced, that, it, will, represent, a, fresh, start, for, the, once, conceited, buend, a, family, however, the, child, turns, out, to, be, the, perpetually, feared, monster, with, the, pig, s, tail, nonetheless, the, appearance, of, love, represents, a, shift, in, macondo, albeit, one, that, leads, to, its, destruction, the, emergence, of, love, in, the, novel, to, displace, the, traditional, egoism, of, the, buend, as, reflects, the, emergence, of, socialist, values, as, a, political, force, in, latin, america, a, force, that, will, sweep, away, the, buend, as, and, the, order, they, represent, the, ending, to, one, hundred, years, of, solitude, could, be, a, wishful, prediction, by, garc, a, m, rquez, a, well, known, socialist, regarding, the, future, of, latin, america, one, hundred, years, of, solitude, contains, several, ideas, concerning, time, although, the, story, can, be, read, as, a, linear, progression, of, events, both, when, considering, individual, lives, and, macondo, s, history, garc, a, m, rquez, allows, room, for, several, other, interpretations, of, time, a, recurring, theme, in, one, hundred, years, of, solitude, is, the, buend, a, family, s, propensity, towards, incest, the, patriarch, of, the, family, jose, arcadio, buend, a, is, the, first, of, numerous, buend, as, to, intermarry, when, he, marries, his, first, cousin, rsula, furthermore, the, fact, that, throughout, the, novel, the, family, is, haunted, by, the, fear, of, punishment, in, the, form, of, the, birth, of, a, monstrous, child, with, a, pig, s, tail, can, be, attributed, to, this, initial, act, and, the, recurring, acts, of, incest, among, the, buend, as, a, theme, throughout, one, hundred, years, of, solitude, is, the, elitism, of, the, buend, a, family, gabriel, garc, a, m, rquez, shows, his, criticism, of, the, latin, american, elite, through, the, stories, of, the, members, of, a, high, status, family, who, are, essentially, in, love, with, themselves, to, the, point, of, being, unable, to, understand, the, mistakes, of, their, past, and, learn, from, them, the, buend, a, family, s, literal, loving, of, themselves, through, incest, not, only, shows, how, elites, consider, themselves, to, be, above, the, law, but, also, reveals, how, little, they, learn, from, their, history, jos, arcadio, buend, a, and, ursula, fear, that, since, their, relationship, is, incestuous, their, child, will, have, animalistic, features, even, though, theirs, does, not, the, final, child, of, the, buend, a, line, aureliano, of, aureliano, and, amaranta, ursula, has, the, tail, of, a, pig, and, because, they, do, not, know, their, history, they, do, not, know, that, this, fear, has, materialized, before, nor, do, they, know, that, had, the, child, lived, removing, the, tail, would, have, resulted, in, his, death, this, speaks, to, how, elites, in, latin, america, do, not, pass, down, history, that, remembers, them, in, a, negative, manner, the, buend, a, family, further, cannot, move, beyond, giving, tribute, to, themselves, in, the, form, of, naming, their, children, the, same, names, over, and, over, again, jos, arcadio, appears, four, times, in, the, family, tree, aureliano, appears, 22, times, remedios, appears, three, times, and, amaranta, and, ursula, appear, twice, the, continual, references, to, the, sprawling, buend, a, house, call, to, mind, the, idea, of, a, big, house, or, hacienda, a, large, land, holding, in, which, elite, families, lived, and, managed, their, lands, and, laborers, in, colombia, where, the, novel, takes, place, a, big, house, was, known, for, being, a, grand, one, story, dwelling, with, many, bedrooms, parlors, a, kitchen, a, pantry, and, a, veranda, all, areas, of, the, buend, a, household, mentioned, throughout, the, book, the, book, focuses, squarely, on, one, family, in, the, midst, of, the, many, residents, of, macondo, as, a, representation, of, how, the, poorest, of, latin, american, villages, have, been, subjugated, and, forgotten, throughout, the, course, of, latin, american, history, one, hundred, years, of, solitude, is, the, first, piece, of, literature, since, the, book, of, genesis, that, should, be, required, reading, for, the, entire, human, race, mr, garc, a, m, rquez, has, done, nothing, less, than, to, create, in, the, reader, a, sense, of, all, that, is, profound, meaningful, and, meaningless, in, life, one, hundred, years, of, solitude, has, received, universal, recognition, the, novel, has, been, awarded, italy, s, chianciano, award, france, s, prix, de, meilleur, livre, etranger, venezuela, s, r, mulo, gallegos, prize, and, the, united, states, books, abroad, neustadt, international, prize, for, literature,

the, novel, topped, the, list, of, books, that, have, most, shaped, world, literature, over, the, last, 25, years, according, to, a, survey, of, international, writers, commissioned, by, the, global, literary, journal, wasafiri, as, a, part, of, its, 25, th, anniversary, celebration, the, superlatives, from, reviewers, and, readers, alike, display, the, resounding, praise, which, the, novel, has, received, chilean, poet, and, nobel, laureate, pablo, neruda, called, it, the, greatest, revelation, in, the, spanish, language, since, don, quixote, of, cervantes, while, john, leonard, in, the, new, york, times, wrote, that, with, a, single, bound, gabriel, garc, a, m, rquez, leaps, onto, the, stage, with, g, nter, grass, and, vladimir, nabokov, according, to, antonio, sacoto, professor, at, the, city, college, of, the, city, university, of, new, york, one, hundred, years, of, solitude, is, considered, one, of, the, five, key, novels, in, hispanic, american, literature, together, with, el, se, or, presidente, pedro, p, ramo, la, muerte, de, artemio, cruz, and, la, ciudad, y, los, perros, these, novels, are, often, considered, representative, of, the, boom, that, allowed, hispanic, american, literature, to, reach, the, quality, of, north, american, and, european, literature, in, terms, of, technical, quality, rich, themes, and, linguistic, innovations, among, other, attributes, in, his, nobel, prize, acceptance, speech, garc, a, m, rquez, addressed, the, significance, of, his, writing, and, proposed, its, role, to, be, more, than, just, literary, expression, i, dare, to, think, that, it, is, this, outsized, reality, and, not, just, its, literary, expression, that, has, deserved, the, attention, of, the, swedish, academy, of, letters, a, reality, not, of, paper, but, one, that, lives, within, us, and, determines, each, instant, of, our, countless, daily, deaths, and, that, nourishes, a, source, of, insatiable, creativity, full, of, sorrow, and, beauty, of, which, this, roving, and, nostalgic, colombian, is, but, one, cipher, more, singled, out, by, fortune, poets, and, beggars, musicians, and, prophets, warriors, and, scoundrels, all, creatures, of, that, unbridled, reality, we, have, had, to, ask, but, little, of, imagination, for, our, crucial, problem, has, been, a, lack, of, conventional, means, to, render, our, lives, believable, this, my, friends, is, the, crux, of, our, solitude, harold, bloom, remarked, my, primary, impression, in, the, act, of, rereading, one, hundred, years, of, solitude, is, a, kind, of, aesthetic, battle, fatigue, since, every, page, is, rammed, full, of, life, beyond, the, capacity, of, any, single, reader, to, absorb, there, are, no, wasted, sentences, no, mere, transitions, in, this, novel, and, you, must, notice, everything, at, the, moment, you, read, it, david, haberly, has, argued, that, garc, a, m, rquez, may, have, borrowed, themes, from, several, works, such, as, william, faulkner, s, yoknapatawpha, county, virginia, woolf, s, orlando, a, biography, defoe, s, a, journal, of, the, plague, year, and, chateaubriand, s, atala, in, an, example, of, intertextuality, in, 2017, chilean, artist, luisa,

is, estimated, that, 8, 000, roma, live, in, colombia, today, however, most, south, american, history, books, exclude, the, presence, of, the, roma, one, hundred, years, of, solitude, differs, from, this, tendency, by, including, the, traveling, roma, throughout, the, story, led, by, a, man, named, melqu, ades, the, roma, bring, new, discoveries, and, technology, to, the, isolated, village, of,

and, afterward, aureliano, now, colonel, aureliano, buend, a, decides, to, continue, fighting, he, departs, macondo, with, the, band, of, people, who, helped, him, oust, the, conservative, army, to, go, continue, fighting, elsewhere, for, the, liberal, side, because, macondo, is, a, fictional, town, created, by, gabriel, garc, a, m, rquez, the, exact, events, of, the, thousand, days, war, as, they, occurred, in, the, book, are, fictional, however, these, events, are, widely, considered, to, be, metaphorical, for, the, thousand, days, war, as, experienced, by, the, entire, country, of, colombia, the, banana, massacre, occurred, december, 5, 6, 1928, in, ci, naga, near, santa, marta, colombia, banana, plantation, workers, had, been, striking, against, the, united, fruit, company, to,

with, relative, accuracy, minus, a, false, sense, of, certainty, about, the, specific, facts, surrounding, the, events, for, instance, although, garcia, m, rquez, writes, that, there, must, have, been, three, thousand, dead, the, true, number, of, victims, is, unknown, however, the, number, likely, was, not, far, off, because, it, is, considered, that, the, number, of, killings, was, over, a, thousand, according, to, dr, jorge, enrique, elias, caro, and, dr, antonino, vidal, ortega, the, lack, of, information, surrounding, the, banana, massacre, is, thought, to, be, largely, due, to, the, manipulation, of, the, information, as, registered, by, the, colombian, government, and, the, united, fruit, company, in, the, novel, s, account, of, the, civil, war, and, subsequent, peace, there, are, numerous, mentions, of, the, pensions, not, arriving, for, the, veterans, a, reference, to, one, of, garc, a, m, rquez, s, earlier, works, el, coronel, no, tiene, quien, le, escriba, in, the,
