gregorian, chant, is, the, central, tradition, of, western, plainchant, a, form, of, monophonic, unaccompanied, sacred, song, in, latin, and, occasionally, greek, of, the, roman, catholic, church, gregorian, chant, developed, mainly, in, western, and, central, europe, during, the, 9th, and, 10th, centuries, with, later, additions, and, redactions, although, popular, legend, credits, pope, gregory, i, with, inventing, gregorian, chant, scholars, believe, that, it, arose, from, a, later, carolingian, synthesis, of, the, old, roman, chant, and, gallican, chant, gregorian, chants, were, organized, initially, into, four, then, eight, and, finally, 12, modes, typical, melodic, features, include, a, characteristic, ambitus, and, also, characteristic, intervallic, patterns, relative, to, a, referential, mode, final, incipits, and, cadences, the, use, of, reciting, tones, at, a, particular, distance, from, the, final, around, which, the, other, notes, of, the, melody, revolve, and, a, vocabulary, of, musical, motifs, woven, together, through, a, process, called, centonization, to, create, families, of, related, chants, the, scale, patterns, are, organized, against, a, background, pattern, formed, of, conjunct, and, disjunct, tetrachords, producing, a, larger, pitch, system, called, the, gamut, the, chants, can, be, sung, by, using, six, note, patterns, called, hexachords, gregorian, melodies, are, traditionally, written, using, neumes, an, early, form, of, musical, notation, from, which, the, modern, four, line, and, five, line, staff, developed, multi, voice, elaborations, of, gregorian, chant, known, as, organum, were, an, early, stage, in, the, development, of, western, polyphony, gregorian, chant, was, traditionally, sung, by, choirs, of, men, and, boys, in, churches, or, by, men, and, women, of, religious, orders, in, their, chapels, it, is, the, music, of, the, roman, rite, performed, in, the, mass, and, the, monastic, office, although, gregorian, chant, supplanted, or, marginalized, the, other, indigenous, plainchant, traditions, of, the, christian, west, to, become, the, official, music, of, the, christian, liturgy, ambrosian, chant, still, continues, in, use, in, milan, and, there, are, musicologists, exploring, both, that, and, the, mozarabic, chant, of, christian, spain, although, gregorian, chant, is, no, longer, obligatory, the, roman, catholic, church, still, officially, considers, it, the, music, most, suitable, for, worship, singing, has, been, part, of, the, christian, liturgy, since, the, earliest, days, of, the, church, it, is, widely, accepted, that, the, psalmody, of, ancient, jewish, worship, significantly, influenced, and, contributed, to, early, christian, ritual, and, chant, christians, read, scriptures, and, sang, chants, as, their, jewish, predecessors, had, done, although, new, christian, liturgy, was, developed, the, source, of, much, of, this, christian, liturgy, was, jewish, psalmody, the, source, materials, for, newly, emergent, christian, chants, were, originally, transmitted, by, jews, in, sung, form, early, christian, rites, also, incorporated, elements, of, jewish, worship, that, survived, in, later, chant, tradition, canonical, hours, have, their, roots, in, jewish, prayer, hours, amen, and, alleluia, come, from, hebrew, and, the, threefold, sanctus, derives, from, the, threefold, kadosh, of, the, kedushah, the, new, testament, mentions, singing, hymns, during, the, last, supper, when, they, had, sung, the, hymn, they, went, out, to, the, mount, of, olives, matthew, 26, 30, other, ancient, witnesses, such, as, pope, clement, i, tertullian, st, athanasius, and, egeria, confirm, the, practice, although, in, poetic, or, obscure, ways, that, shed, little, light, on, how, music, sounded, during, this, period, musical, elements, that, would, later, be, used, in, the, roman, rite, began, to, appear, in, the, 3rd, century, the, apostolic, tradition, attributed, to, the, theologian, hippolytus, attests, the, singing, of, hallel, jewish, psalms, with, alleluia, as, the, refrain, in, early, christian, agape, feasts, chants, of, the, office, sung, during, the, canonical, hours, have, their, roots, in, the, early, 4th, century, when, desert, monks, following, st, anthony, introduced, the, practice, of, continuous, psalmody, singing, the, complete, cycle, of, 150, psalms, each, week, around, 375, antiphonal, psalmody, became, popular, in, the, christian, east, in, 386, st, ambrose, introduced, this, practice, to, the, west, in, the, fifth, century, a, singing, school, the, schola, cantorum, was, founded, at, rome, to, provide, training, in, church, musicianship, scholars, are, still, debating, how, plainchant, developed, during, the, 5th, through, the, 9th, centuries, as, information, from, this, period, is, scarce, around, 410, st, augustine, described, the, responsorial, singing, of, a, gradual, psalm, at, mass, at, c, 520, benedict, of, nursia, established, what, is, called, the, rule, of, st, benedict, in, which, the, protocol, of, the, divine, office, for, monastic, use, was, laid, down, around, 678, roman, chant, was, taught, at, york, distinctive, regional, traditions, of, western, plainchant, arose, during, this, period, notably, in, the, british, isles, celtic, chant, spain, mozarabic, gaul, gallican, and, italy, old, roman, ambrosian, and, beneventan, these, traditions, may, have, evolved, from, a, hypothetical, year, round, repertory, of, 5th, century, plainchant, after, the, western, roman, empire, collapsed, john, the, deacon, biographer, c, 872, of, pope, gregory, i, modestly, claimed, that, the, saint, compiled, a, patchwork, antiphonary, unsurprisingly, given, his, considerable, work, with, liturgical, development, he, reorganized, the, schola, cantorum, and, established, a, more, uniform, standard, in, church, services, gathering, chants, from, among, the, regional, traditions, as, widely, as, he, could, manage, of, those, he, retained, what, he, could, revised, where, necessary, and, assigned, particular, chants, to, the, various, services, according, to, donald, jay, grout, his, goal, was, to, organize, the, bodies, of, chants, from, diverse, traditions, into, a, uniform, and, orderly, whole, for, use, by, the, entire, western, region, of, the, church, his, renowned, love, for, music, was, recorded, only, 34, years, after, his, death, the, epitaph, of, honorius, testified, that, comparison, to, gregory, was, already, considered, the, highest, praise, for, a, music, loving, pope, while, later, legends, magnified, his, real, achievements, these, significant, steps, may, account, for, why, his, name, came, to, be, attached, to, gregorian, chant, the, gregorian, repertory, was, further, systematized, for, use, in, the, roman, rite, and, scholars, weigh, the, relative, influences, of, roman, and, carolingian, practices, upon, the, development, of, plainchant, the, late, 8th, century, saw, a, steadily, increasing, influence, of, the, carolingian, monarchs, over, the, popes, during, a, visit, to, gaul, in, 752, 753, pope, stephen, ii, celebrated, mass, using, roman, chant, according, to, charlemagne, his, father, pepin, abolished, the, local, gallican, rites, in, favor, of, the, roman, use, to, strengthen, ties, with, rome, thirty, years, later, 785, 786, at, charlemagne, s, request, pope, adrian, i, sent, a, papal, sacramentary, with, roman, chants, to, the, carolingian, court, according, to, james, mckinnon, over, a, brief, period, in, the, 8th, century, a, project, overseen, by, chrodegang, of, metz, in, the, favorable, atmosphere, of, the, carolingian, monarchs, also, compiled, the, core, liturgy, of, the, roman, mass, and, promoted, its, use, in, francia, and, throughout, gaul, willi, apel, and, robert, snow, assert, a, scholarly, consensus, that, gregorian, chant, developed, around, 750, from, a, synthesis, of, roman, and, gallican, chants, and, was, commissioned, by, the, carolingian, rulers, in, france, andreas, pfisterer, and, peter, jeffery, have, shown, that, older, melodic, essentials, from, roman, chant, are, clear, in, the, synthesized, chant, repertory, there, were, other, developments, as, well, chants, were, modified, influenced, by, local, styles, and, gallican, chant, and, fitted, into, the, theory, of, the, ancient, greek, octoechos, system, of, modes, in, a, manner, that, created, what, later, came, to, be, known, as, the, western, system, of, the, eight, church, modes, the, metz, project, also, invented, an, innovative, musical, notation, using, freeform, neumes, to, show, the, shape, of, a, remembered, melody, this, notation, was, further, developed, over, time, culminating, in, the, introduction, of, staff, lines, attributed, to, guido, d, arezzo, in, the, early, 11th, century, what, we, know, today, as, plainchant, notation, the, whole, body, of, frankish, roman, carolingian, chant, augmented, with, new, chants, to, complete, the, liturgical, year, coalesced, into, a, single, body, of, chant, that, was, called, gregorian, the, changes, made, in, the, new, system, of, chants, were, so, significant, that, they, have, led, some, scholars, to, speculate, that, it, was, named, in, honor, of, the, contemporary, pope, gregory, ii, nevertheless, the, lore, surrounding, pope, gregory, i, was, sufficient, to, culminate, in, his, portrayal, as, the, actual, author, of, gregorian, chant, he, was, often, depicted, as, receiving, the, dictation, of, plainchant, from, a, dove, representing, the, holy, spirit, thus, giving, gregorian, chant, the, stamp, of, being, divinely, inspired, scholars, agree, that, the, melodic, content, of, much, gregorian, chant, did, not, exist, in, that, form, in, gregory, i, s, day, in, addition, it, is, known, definitively, that, the, familiar, neumatic, system, for, notating, plainchant, had, not, been, established, in, his, time, nevertheless, gregory, s, authorship, is, popularly, accepted, by, some, as, fact, to, this, day, gregorian, chant, appeared, in, a, remarkably, uniform, state, across, europe, within, a, short, time, charlemagne, once, elevated, to, holy, roman, emperor, aggressively, spread, gregorian, chant, throughout, his, empire, to, consolidate, religious, and, secular, power, requiring, the, clergy, to, use, the, new, repertory, on, pain, of, death, from, english, and, german, sources, gregorian, chant, spread, north, to, scandinavia, iceland, and, finland, in, 885, pope, stephen, v, banned, the, slavonic, liturgy, leading, to, the, ascendancy, of, gregorian, chant, in, eastern, catholic, lands, including, poland, moravia, and, slovakia, the, other, plainchant, repertories, of, the, christian, west, faced, severe, competition, from, the, new, gregorian, chant, charlemagne, continued, his, father, s, policy, of, favoring, the, roman, rite, over, the, local, gallican, traditions, by, the, 9th, century, the, gallican, rite, and, chant, had, effectively, been, eliminated, although, not, without, local, resistance, the, gregorian, chant, of, the, sarum, rite, displaced, celtic, chant, gregorian, coexisted, with, beneventan, chant, for, over, a, century, before, beneventan, chant, was, abolished, by, papal, decree, 1058, mozarabic, chant, survived, the, influx, of, the, visigoths, and, moors, but, not, the, roman, backed, prelates, newly, installed, in, spain, during, the, reconquista, restricted, to, a, handful, of, dedicated, chapels, modern, mozarabic, chant, is, highly, gregorianized, and, bears, no, musical, resemblance, to, its, original, form, ambrosian, chant, alone, survived, to, the, present, day, preserved, in, milan, due, to, the, musical, reputation, and, ecclesiastical, authority, of, st, ambrose, gregorian, chant, eventually, replaced, the, local, chant, tradition, of, rome, itself, which, is, now, known, as, old, roman, chant, in, the, 10th, century, virtually, no, musical, manuscripts, were, being, notated, in, italy, instead, roman, popes, imported, gregorian, chant, from, german, holy, roman, emperors, during, the, 10th, and, 11th, centuries, for, example, the, credo, was, added, to, the, roman, rite, at, the, behest, of, the, emperor, henry, ii, in, 1014, reinforced, by, the, legend, of, pope, gregory, gregorian, chant, was, taken, to, be, the, authentic, original, chant, of, rome, a, misconception, that, continues, to, this, day, by, the, 12th, and, 13th, centuries, gregorian, chant, had, supplanted, or, marginalized, all, the, other, western, plainchant, traditions, later, sources, of, these, other, chant, traditions, show, an, increasing, gregorian, influence, such, as, occasional, efforts, to, categorize, their, chants, into, the, gregorian, modes, similarly, the, gregorian, repertory, incorporated, elements, of, these, lost, plainchant, traditions, which, can, be, identified, by, careful, stylistic, and, historical, analysis, for, example, the, improperia, of, good, friday, are, believed, to, be, a, remnant, of, the, gallican, repertory, the, first, extant, sources, with, musical, notation, were, written, around, 930, graduale, laon, before, this, plainchant, had, been, transmitted, orally, most, scholars, of, gregorian, chant, agree, that, the, development, of, music, notation, assisted, the, dissemination, of, chant, across, europe, the, earlier, notated, manuscripts, are, primarily, from, regensburg, in, germany, st, gall, in, switzerland, laon, and, st, martial, in, france, gregorian, chant, has, in, its, long, history, been, subjected, to, a, series, of, redactions, to, bring, it, up, to, changing, contemporary, tastes, and, practice, the, more, recent, redaction, undertaken, in, the, benedictine, abbey, of, st, pierre, solesmes, has, turned, into, a, huge, undertaking, to, restore, the, allegedly, corrupted, chant, to, a, hypothetical, original, state, early, gregorian, chant, was, revised, to, conform, to, the, theoretical, structure, of, the, modes, in, 1562, 63, the, council, of, trent, banned, most, sequences, guidette, s, directorium, chori, published, in, 1582, and, the, editio, medicea, published, in, 1614, drastically, revised, what, was, perceived, as, corrupt, and, flawed, barbarism, by, making, the, chants, conform, to, contemporary, aesthetic, standards, in, 1811, the, french, musicologist, alexandre, tienne, choron, as, part, of, a, conservative, backlash, following, the, liberal, catholic, orders, inefficacy, during, the, french, revolution, called, for, returning, to, the, purer, gregorian, chant, of, rome, over, french, corruptions, in, the, late, 19th, century, early, liturgical, and, musical, manuscripts, were, unearthed, and, edited, earlier, dom, prosper, gu, ranger, revived, the, monastic, tradition, in, solesmes, re, establishing, the, divine, office, was, among, his, priorities, but, no, proper, chantbooks, existed, many, monks, were, sent, out, to, libraries, throughout, europe, to, find, relevant, chant, manuscripts, in, 1871, however, the, old, medicea, edition, was, reprinted, pustet, regensburg, which, pope, pius, ix, declared, the, only, official, version, in, their, firm, belief, that, they, were, on, the, right, way, solesmes, increased, its, efforts, in, 1889, after, decades, of, research, the, monks, of, solesmes, released, the, first, book, in, a, planned, series, the, pal, ographie, musicale, the, incentive, of, its, publication, was, to, demonstrate, the, corruption, of, the, medicea, by, presenting, photographed, notations, originating, from, a, great, variety, of, manuscripts, of, one, single, chant, which, solesmes, called, forth, as, witnesses, to, assert, their, own, reforms, the, monks, of, solesmes, brought, in, their, heaviest, artillery, in, this, battle, as, indeed, the, academically, sound, paleo, was, intended, to, be, a, war, tank, meant, to, abolish, once, and, for, all, the, corrupted, pustet, edition, on, the, evidence, of, congruence, throughout, various, manuscripts, which, were, duly, published, in, facsimile, editions, with, ample, editorial, introductions, solesmes, was, able, to, work, out, a, practical, reconstruction, this, reconstructed, chant, was, academically, praised, but, rejected, by, rome, until, 1903, when, pope, leo, xiii, died, his, successor, pope, pius, x, promptly, accepted, the, solesmes, chant, now, compiled, as, the, liber, usualis, as, authoritative, in, 1904, the, vatican, edition, of, the, solesmes, chant, was, commissioned, serious, academic, debates, arose, primarily, owing, to, stylistic, liberties, taken, by, the, solesmes, editors, to, impose, their, controversial, interpretation, of, rhythm, the, solesmes, editions, insert, phrasing, marks, and, note, lengthening, episema, and, mora, marks, not, found, in, the, original, sources, conversely, they, omit, significative, letters, found, in, the, original, sources, which, give, instructions, for, rhythm, and, articulation, such, as, speeding, up, or, slowing, down, these, editorial, practices, have, placed, the, historical, authenticity, of, the, solesmes, interpretation, in, doubt, ever, since, restoration, of, chant, was, taken, up, in, solesmes, there, have, been, lengthy, discussions, of, exactly, what, course, was, to, be, taken, some, favored, a, strict, academic, rigour, and, wanted, to, postpone, publications, while, others, concentrated, on, practical, matters, and, wanted, to, supplant, the, corrupted, tradition, as, soon, as, possible, roughly, a, century, later, there, still, exists, a, breach, between, a, strict, musicological, approach, and, the, practical, needs, of, church, choirs, thus, the, performance, tradition, officially, promulgated, since, the, onset, of, the, solesmes, restoration, is, substantially, at, odds, with, musicological, evidence, in, his, motu, proprio, tra, le, sollecitudini, pius, x, mandated, the, use, of, gregorian, chant, encouraging, the, faithful, to, sing, the, ordinary, of, the, mass, although, he, reserved, the, singing, of, the, propers, for, males, while, this, custom, is, maintained, in, traditionalist, catholic, communities, most, of, which, allow, all, female, scholas, as, well, though, the, catholic, church, no, longer, persists, with, this, ban, vatican, ii, officially, allowed, worshipers, to, substitute, other, music, particularly, sacred, polyphony, in, place, of, gregorian, chant, although, it, did, reaffirm, that, gregorian, chant, was, still, the, official, music, of, the, roman, rite, of, the, catholic, church, and, the, music, most, suitable, for, worship, in, the, roman, liturgy, gregorian, chant, is, as, chant, implies, vocal, music, the, text, the, phrases, words, and, eventually, the, syllables, can, be, sung, in, various, ways, the, most, straightforward, is, recitation, on, the, same, tone, which, is, called, syllabic, as, each, syllable, is, sung, to, a, single, tone, likewise, simple, chants, are, often, syllabic, throughout, with, only, a, few, instances, where, two, or, more, notes, are, sung, on, one, syllable, neumatic, chants, are, more, embellished, and, ligatures, a, connected, group, of, notes, written, as, a, single, compound, neume, abound, in, the, text, melismatic, chants, are, the, most, ornate, chants, in, which, elaborate, melodies, are, sung, on, long, sustained, vowels, as, in, the, alleluia, ranging, from, five, or, six, notes, per, syllable, to, over, sixty, in, the, more, prolix, melismata, gregorian, chants, fall, into, two, broad, categories, of, melody, recitatives, and, free, melodies, the, simplest, kind, of, melody, is, the, liturgical, recitative, recitative, melodies, are, dominated, by, a, single, pitch, called, the, reciting, tone, other, pitches, appear, in, melodic, formulae, for, incipits, partial, cadences, and, full, cadences, these, chants, are, primarily, syllabic, for, example, the, collect, for, easter, consists, of, 127, syllables, sung, to, 131, pitches, with, 108, of, these, pitches, being, the, reciting, note, a, and, the, other, 23, pitches, flexing, down, to, g, liturgical, recitatives, are, commonly, found, in, the, accentus, chants, of, the, liturgy, such, as, the, intonations, of, the, collect, epistle, and, gospel, during, the, mass, and, in, the, direct, psalmody, of, the, office, psalmodic, chants, which, intone, psalms, include, both, recitatives, and, free, melodies, psalmodic, chants, include, direct, psalmody, antiphonal, chants, and, responsorial, chants, in, direct, psalmody, psalm, verses, are, sung, without, refrains, to, simple, formulaic, tones, most, psalmodic, chants, are, antiphonal, and, responsorial, sung, to, free, melodies, of, varying, complexity, antiphonal, chants, such, as, the, introit, and, communion, originally, referred, to, chants, in, which, two, choirs, sang, in, alternation, one, choir, singing, verses, of, a, psalm, the, other, singing, a, refrain, called, an, antiphon, over, time, the, verses, were, reduced, in, number, usually, to, just, one, psalm, verse, and, the, doxology, or, even, omitted, entirely, antiphonal, chants, reflect, their, ancient, origins, as, elaborate, recitatives, through, the, reciting, tones, in, their, melodies, ordinary, chants, such, as, the, kyrie, and, gloria, are, not, considered, antiphonal, chants, although, they, are, often, performed, in, antiphonal, style, responsorial, chants, such, as, the, gradual, alleluia, offertory, and, the, office, responsories, originally, consisted, of, a, refrain, called, a, respond, sung, by, a, choir, alternating, with, psalm, verses, sung, by, a, soloist, responsorial, chants, are, often, composed, of, an, amalgamation, of, various, stock, musical, phrases, pieced, together, in, a, practice, called, centonization, tracts, are, melismatic, settings, of, psalm, verses, and, use, frequent, recurring, cadences, and, they, are, strongly, centonized, gregorian, chant, evolved, to, fulfill, various, functions, in, the, roman, catholic, liturgy, broadly, speaking, liturgical, recitatives, are, used, for, texts, intoned, by, deacons, or, priests, antiphonal, chants, accompany, liturgical, actions, the, entrance, of, the, officiant, the, collection, of, offerings, and, the, distribution, of, the, eucharist, responsorial, chants, expand, on, readings, and, lessons, the, non, psalmodic, chants, including, the, ordinary, of, the, mass, sequences, and, hymns, were, originally, intended, for, congregational, singing, the, structure, of, their, texts, largely, defines, their, musical, style, in, sequences, the, same, melodic, phrase, is, repeated, in, each, couplet, the, strophic, texts, of, hymns, use, the, same, syllabic, melody, for, each, stanza, early, plainchant, like, much, of, western, music, is, believed, to, have, been, distinguished, by, the, use, of, the, diatonic, scale, modal, theory, which, postdates, the, composition, of, the, core, chant, repertory, arises, from, a, synthesis, of, two, very, different, traditions, the, speculative, tradition, of, numerical, ratios, and, species, inherited, from, ancient, greece, and, a, second, tradition, rooted, in, the, practical, art, of, cantus, the, earliest, writings, that, deal, with, both, theory, and, practice, include, the, enchiriadis, group, of, treatises, which, circulated, in, the, late, ninth, century, and, possibly, have, their, roots, in, an, earlier, oral, tradition, in, contrast, to, the, ancient, greek, system, of, tetrachords, a, collection, of, four, continuous, notes, that, descend, by, two, tones, and, a, semitone, the, enchiriadis, writings, base, their, tone, system, on, a, tetrachord, that, corresponds, to, the, four, finals, of, chant, d, e, f, and, g, the, disjunct, tetrachords, in, the, enchiriadis, system, have, been, the, subject, of, much, speculation, because, they, do, not, correspond, to, the, diatonic, framework, that, became, the, standard, medieval, scale, for, example, there, is, a, high, f, a, note, not, recognized, by, later, medieval, writers, a, diatonic, scale, with, a, chromatically, alterable, b, b, flat, was, first, described, by, hucbald, who, adopted, the, tetrachord, of, the, finals, d, e, f, g, and, constructed, the, rest, of, the, system, following, the, model, of, the, greek, greater, and, lesser, perfect, systems, these, were, the, first, steps, in, forging, a, theoretical, tradition, that, corresponded, to, chant, around, 1025, guido, d, arezzo, revolutionized, western, music, with, the, development, of, the, gamut, in, which, pitches, in, the, singing, range, were, organized, into, overlapping, hexachords, hexachords, could, be, built, on, c, the, natural, hexachord, c, d, e, f, g, a, f, the, soft, hexachord, using, a, b, flat, f, g, a, b, c, d, or, g, the, hard, hexachord, using, a, b, natural, g, a, b, c, d, e, the, b, flat, was, an, integral, part, of, the, system, of, hexachords, rather, than, an, accidental, the, use, of, notes, outside, of, this, collection, was, described, as, musica, ficta, gregorian, chant, was, categorized, into, eight, modes, influenced, by, the, eightfold, division, of, byzantine, chants, called, the, oktoechos, each, mode, is, distinguished, by, its, final, dominant, and, ambitus, the, final, is, the, ending, note, which, is, usually, an, important, note, in, the, overall, structure, of, the, melody, the, dominant, is, a, secondary, pitch, that, usually, serves, as, a, reciting, tone, in, the, melody, ambitus, refers, to, the, range, of, pitches, used, in, the, melody, melodies, whose, final, is, in, the, middle, of, the, ambitus, or, which, have, only, a, limited, ambitus, are, categorized, as, plagal, while, melodies, whose, final, is, in, the, lower, end, of, the, ambitus, and, have, a, range, of, over, five, or, six, notes, are, categorized, as, authentic, although, corresponding, plagal, and, authentic, modes, have, the, same, final, they, have, different, dominants, the, existent, pseudo, greek, names, of, the, modes, rarely, used, in, medieval, times, derive, from, a, misunderstanding, of, the, ancient, greek, modes, the, prefix, hypo, under, gr, indicates, a, plagal, mode, where, the, melody, moves, below, the, final, in, contemporary, latin, manuscripts, the, modes, are, simply, called, protus, authentus, plagalis, deuterus, tritus, and, tetrardus, the, 1st, mode, authentic, or, plagal, the, 2nd, mode, etc, in, the, roman, chantbooks, the, modes, are, indicated, by, roman, numerals, although, the, modes, with, melodies, ending, on, a, b, and, c, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, aeolian, locrian, and, ionian, these, are, not, considered, distinct, modes, and, are, treated, as, transpositions, of, whichever, mode, uses, the, same, set, of, hexachords, the, actual, pitch, of, the, gregorian, chant, is, not, fixed, so, the, piece, can, be, sung, in, whichever, range, is, most, comfortable, certain, classes, of, gregorian, chant, have, a, separate, musical, formula, for, each, mode, allowing, one, section, of, the, chant, to, transition, smoothly, into, the, next, section, such, as, the, psalm, verses, that, are, sung, between, the, repetition, of, antiphons, or, the, gloria, patri, thus, we, find, models, for, the, recitation, of, psalmverses, alleluia, and, gloria, patri, for, all, eight, modes, not, every, gregorian, chant, fits, neatly, into, guido, s, hexachords, or, into, the, system, of, eight, modes, for, example, there, are, chants, especially, from, german, sources, whose, neumes, suggest, a, warbling, of, pitches, between, the, notes, e, and, f, outside, the, hexachord, system, or, in, other, words, employing, a, form, of, chromaticism, early, gregorian, chant, like, ambrosian, and, old, roman, chant, whose, melodies, are, most, closely, related, to, gregorian, did, not, use, the, modal, system, the, great, need, for, a, system, of, organizing, chants, lies, in, the, need, to, link, antiphons, with, standard, tones, as, in, for, example, the, psalmody, at, the, office, using, psalm, tone, i, with, an, antiphon, in, mode, 1, makes, for, a, smooth, transition, between, the, end, of, the, antiphon, and, the, intonation, of, the, tone, and, the, ending, of, the, tone, can, then, be, chosen, to, provide, a, smooth, transition, back, to, the, antiphon, as, the, modal, system, gained, acceptance, gregorian, chants, were, edited, to, conform, to, the, modes, especially, during, 12th, century, cistercian, reforms, finals, were, altered, melodic, ranges, reduced, melismata, trimmed, b, flats, eliminated, and, repeated, words, removed, despite, these, attempts, to, impose, modal, consistency, some, chants, notably, communions, defy, simple, modal, assignment, for, example, in, four, medieval, manuscripts, the, communion, circuibo, was, transcribed, using, a, different, mode, in, each, several, features, besides, modality, contribute, to, the, musical, idiom, of, gregorian, chant, giving, it, a, distinctive, musical, flavor, melodic, motion, is, primarily, stepwise, skips, of, a, third, are, common, and, larger, skips, far, more, common, than, in, other, plainchant, repertories, such, as, ambrosian, chant, or, beneventan, chant, gregorian, melodies, are, more, likely, to, traverse, a, seventh, than, a, full, octave, so, that, melodies, rarely, travel, from, d, up, to, the, d, an, octave, higher, but, often, travel, from, d, to, the, c, a, seventh, higher, using, such, patterns, as, d, f, g, a, c, gregorian, melodies, often, explore, chains, of, pitches, such, as, f, a, c, around, which, the, other, notes, of, the, chant, gravitate, within, each, mode, certain, incipits, and, cadences, are, preferred, which, the, modal, theory, alone, does, not, explain, chants, often, display, complex, internal, structures, that, combine, and, repeat, musical, subphrases, this, occurs, notably, in, the, offertories, in, chants, with, shorter, repeating, texts, such, as, the, kyrie, and, agnus, dei, and, in, longer, chants, with, clear, textual, divisions, such, as, the, great, responsories, the, gloria, and, the, credo, chants, sometimes, fall, into, melodically, related, groups, the, musical, phrases, centonized, to, create, graduals, and, tracts, follow, a, musical, grammar, of, sorts, certain, phrases, are, used, only, at, the, beginnings, of, chants, or, only, at, the, end, or, only, in, certain, combinations, creating, musical, families, of, chants, such, as, the, iustus, ut, palma, family, of, graduals, several, introits, in, mode, 3, including, loquetur, dominus, above, exhibit, melodic, similarities, mode, iii, e, authentic, chants, have, c, as, a, dominant, so, c, is, the, expected, reciting, tone, these, mode, iii, introits, however, use, both, g, and, c, as, reciting, tones, and, often, begin, with, a, decorated, leap, from, g, to, c, to, establish, this, tonality, similar, examples, exist, throughout, the, repertory, the, earliest, notated, sources, of, gregorian, chant, written, c, 950, used, symbols, called, neumes, gr, sign, of, the, hand, to, indicate, tone, movements, and, relative, duration, within, each, syllable, a, sort, of, musical, stenography, that, seems, to, focus, on, gestures, and, tone, movements, but, not, the, specific, pitches, of, individual, notes, nor, the, relative, starting, pitches, of, each, neume, given, the, fact, that, chant, was, learned, in, an, oral, tradition, in, which, the, texts, and, melodies, were, sung, from, memory, this, was, obviously, not, necessary, the, neumatic, manuscripts, display, great, sophistication, and, precision, in, notation, and, a, wealth, of, graphic, signs, to, indicate, the, musical, gesture, and, proper, pronunciation, of, the, text, scholars, postulate, that, this, practice, may, have, been, derived, from, cheironomic, hand, gestures, the, ekphonetic, notation, of, byzantine, chant, punctuation, marks, or, diacritical, accents, later, adaptations, and, innovations, included, the, use, of, a, dry, scratched, line, or, an, inked, line, or, two, lines, marked, c, or, f, showing, the, relative, pitches, between, neumes, consistent, relative, heightening, first, developed, in, the, aquitaine, region, particularly, at, st, martial, de, limoges, in, the, first, half, of, the, eleventh, century, many, german, speaking, areas, however, continued, to, use, unpitched, neumes, into, the, twelfth, century, additional, symbols, developed, such, as, the, custos, placed, at, the, end, of, a, system, to, show, the, next, pitch, other, symbols, indicated, changes, in, articulation, duration, or, tempo, such, as, a, letter, t, to, indicate, a, tenuto, another, form, of, early, notation, used, a, system, of, letters, corresponding, to, different, pitches, much, as, shaker, music, is, notated, by, the, 13th, century, the, neumes, of, gregorian, chant, were, usually, written, in, square, notation, on, a, four, line, staff, with, a, clef, as, in, the, graduale, aboense, pictured, above, in, square, notation, small, groups, of, ascending, notes, on, a, syllable, are, shown, as, stacked, squares, read, from, bottom, to, top, while, descending, notes, are, written, with, diamonds, read, from, left, to, right, when, a, syllable, has, a, large, number, of, notes, a, series, of, smaller, such, groups, of, neumes, are, written, in, succession, read, from, left, to, right, the, oriscus, quilisma, and, liquescent, neumes, indicate, special, vocal, treatments, that, have, been, largely, neglected, due, to, uncertainty, as, to, how, to, sing, them, since, the, 1970s, with, the, influential, insights, of, dom, eug, ne, cardine, see, below, under, rhythm, ornamental, neumes, have, received, more, attention, from, both, researchers, and, performers, b, flat, is, indicated, by, a, b, mollum, lat, soft, a, rounded, undercaste, b, placed, to, the, left, of, the, entire, neume, in, which, the, note, occurs, as, shown, in, the, kyrie, to, the, right, when, necessary, a, b, durum, lat, hard, written, squarely, indicates, b, natural, and, serves, to, cancel, the, b, mollum, this, system, of, square, notation, is, standard, in, modern, chantbooks, gregorian, chant, was, originally, used, for, singing, the, office, by, male, and, female, religious, and, for, singing, the, parts, of, the, mass, pertaining, to, the, lay, faithful, male, and, female, the, celebrant, priest, always, male, and, the, choir, composed, of, male, ordained, clergy, except, in, convents, outside, the, larger, cities, the, number, of, available, clergy, dropped, and, lay, men, started, singing, these, parts, the, choir, was, considered, an, official, liturgical, duty, reserved, to, clergy, so, women, were, not, allowed, to, sing, in, the, schola, cantorum, or, other, choirs, except, in, convents, where, women, were, permitted, to, sing, the, office, and, the, parts, of, the, mass, pertaining, to, the, choir, as, a, function, of, their, consecrated, life, chant, was, normally, sung, in, unison, later, innovations, included, tropes, which, is, a, new, text, sung, to, the, same, melodic, phrases, in, a, melismatic, chant, repeating, an, entire, alleluia, melody, on, a, new, text, for, instance, or, repeating, a, full, phrase, with, a, new, text, that, comments, on, the, previously, sung, text, and, various, forms, of, organum, improvised, harmonic, embellishment, of, chant, melodies, focusing, on, octaves, fifths, fourths, and, later, thirds, neither, tropes, nor, organum, however, belong, to, the, chant, repertory, proper, the, main, exception, to, this, is, the, sequence, whose, origins, lay, in, troping, the, extended, melisma, of, alleluia, chants, known, as, the, jubilus, but, the, sequences, like, the, tropes, were, later, officially, suppressed, the, council, of, trent, struck, sequences, from, the, gregorian, corpus, except, those, for, easter, pentecost, corpus, christi, and, all, souls, day, not, much, is, known, about, the, particular, vocal, stylings, or, performance, practices, used, for, gregorian, chant, in, the, middle, ages, on, occasion, the, clergy, was, urged, to, have, their, singers, perform, with, more, restraint, and, piety, this, suggests, that, virtuosic, performances, occurred, contrary, to, the, modern, stereotype, of, gregorian, chant, as, slow, moving, mood, music, this, tension, between, musicality, and, piety, goes, far, back, gregory, the, great, himself, criticized, the, practice, of, promoting, clerics, based, on, their, charming, singing, rather, than, their, preaching, however, odo, of, cluny, a, renowned, monastic, reformer, praised, the, intellectual, and, musical, virtuosity, to, be, found, in, chant, for, in, these, there, are, the, most, varied, kinds, of, ascent, descent, repeat, delight, for, the, cognoscenti, difficulty, for, the, beginners, and, an, admirable, organization, that, widely, differs, from, other, chants, they, are, not, so, much, made, according, to, the, rules, of, music, but, rather, evince, the, authority, and, validity, of, music, true, antiphonal, performance, by, two, alternating, choruses, still, occurs, as, in, certain, german, monasteries, however, antiphonal, chants, are, generally, performed, in, responsorial, style, by, a, solo, cantor, alternating, with, a, chorus, this, practice, appears, to, have, begun, in, the, middle, ages, another, medieval, innovation, had, the, solo, cantor, sing, the, opening, words, of, responsorial, chants, with, the, full, chorus, finishing, the, end, of, the, opening, phrase, this, innovation, allowed, the, soloist, to, fix, the, pitch, of, the, chant, for, the, chorus, and, to, cue, the, choral, entrance, given, the, oral, teaching, tradition, of, gregorian, chant, modern, reconstruction, of, intended, rhythm, from, the, written, notation, of, gregorian, chant, has, always, been, a, source, of, debate, among, modern, scholars, to, complicate, matters, further, many, ornamental, neumes, used, in, the, earliest, manuscripts, pose, difficulties, on, the, interpretation, of, rhythm, certain, neumes, such, as, the, pressus, pes, quassus, strophic, neumes, may, indicate, repeated, notes, lengthening, by, repercussion, in, some, cases, with, added, ornaments, by, the, 13th, century, with, the, widespread, use, of, square, notation, most, chant, was, sung, with, an, approximately, equal, duration, allotted, to, each, note, although, jerome, of, moravia, cites, exceptions, in, which, certain, notes, such, as, the, final, notes, of, a, chant, are, lengthened, while, the, standard, repertory, of, gregorian, chant, was, partly, being, supplanted, by, new, forms, of, polyphony, the, earlier, melo, rhythmic, refinements, of, monophonic, chant, seem, to, have, fallen, into, disuse, later, redactions, such, as, the, editio, medicaea, of, 1614, rewrote, chant, so, that, melismata, with, their, melodic, accent, fell, on, accented, syllables, this, aesthetic, held, sway, until, the, re, examination, of, chant, in, the, late, 19th, century, by, such, scholars, as, peter, wagner, pothier, and, mocquereau, who, fell, into, two, camps, one, school, of, thought, including, wagner, jammers, and, lipphardt, advocated, imposing, rhythmic, meters, on, chants, although, they, disagreed, on, how, that, should, be, done, an, opposing, interpretation, represented, by, pothier, and, mocquereau, supported, a, free, rhythm, of, equal, note, values, although, some, notes, are, lengthened, for, textual, emphasis, or, musical, effect, the, modern, solesmes, editions, of, gregorian, chant, follow, this, interpretation, mocquereau, divided, melodies, into, two, and, three, note, phrases, each, beginning, with, an, ictus, akin, to, a, beat, notated, in, chantbooks, as, a, small, vertical, mark, these, basic, melodic, units, combined, into, larger, phrases, through, a, complex, system, expressed, by, cheironomic, hand, gestures, this, approach, prevailed, during, the, twentieth, century, propagated, by, justine, ward, s, program, of, music, education, for, children, until, the, liturgical, role, of, chant, was, diminished, after, the, liturgical, reforms, of, pope, paul, vi, and, new, scholarship, essentially, discredited, mocquereau, s, rhythmic, theories, common, modern, practice, favors, performing, gregorian, chant, with, no, beat, or, regular, metric, accent, largely, for, aesthetic, reasons, the, text, determines, the, accent, while, the, melodic, contour, determines, the, phrasing, the, note, lengthenings, recommended, by, the, solesmes, school, remain, influential, though, not, prescriptive, dom, eug, ne, cardine, 1905, 1988, a, monk, from, solesmes, published, his, semiologie, gregorienne, in, 1970, in, which, he, clearly, explains, the, musical, significance, of, the, neumes, of, the, early, chant, manuscripts, cardine, shows, the, great, diversity, of, neumes, and, graphic, variations, of, the, basic, shape, of, a, particular, neume, which, can, not, be, expressed, in, the, square, notation, this, variety, in, notation, must, have, served, a, practical, purpose, and, therefore, a, musical, significance, nine, years, later, the, graduale, triplex, was, published, in, which, the, roman, gradual, containing, all, the, chants, for, mass, in, a, year, s, cycle, appeared, with, the, neumes, of, the, two, most, important, manuscripts, copied, under, and, over, the, 4, line, staff, of, the, square, notation, the, graduale, triplex, made, widely, accessible, the, original, notation, of, sankt, gallen, and, laon, compiled, after, 930, ad, in, a, single, chantbook, and, was, a, huge, step, forward, dom, cardine, had, many, students, who, have, each, in, their, own, way, continued, their, semiological, studies, some, of, whom, also, started, experimenting, in, applying, the, newly, understood, principles, in, performance, practice, the, studies, of, cardine, and, his, students, godehard, joppich, luigi, augustoni, johannes, b, g, schl, marie, no, l, colette, rupert, fischer, marie, claire, billecocq, alexander, m, schweitzer, to, name, a, few, have, clearly, demonstrated, that, rhythm, in, gregorian, chant, as, notated, in, the, 10th, century, rhythmic, manuscripts, notably, sankt, gallen, and, laon, manifest, such, rhythmic, diversity, and, melodic, rhythmic, ornamentations, for, which, there, is, hardly, a, living, performance, tradition, in, the, western, world, contemporary, groups, that, endeavour, to, sing, according, to, the, manuscript, traditions, have, evolved, after, 1975, some, practising, researchers, favour, a, closer, look, at, non, western, liturgical, traditions, in, such, cultures, where, the, tradition, of, modal, monophony, was, never, abandoned, another, group, with, different, views, are, the, mensuralists, or, the, proportionalists, who, maintain, that, rhythm, has, to, be, interpreted, proportionately, where, shorts, are, exactly, half, the, longs, this, school, of, interpretation, claims, the, support, of, historical, authorities, such, as, st, augustine, remigius, guido, and, aribo, this, view, is, advocated, by, john, blackley, and, his, schola, antiqua, new, york, recent, research, in, the, netherlands, by, dr, dirk, van, kampen, has, indicated, that, the, authentic, rhythm, of, gregorian, chant, in, the, 10th, century, includes, both, proportional, elements, and, elements, that, are, in, agreement, with, semiology, starting, with, the, expectation, that, the, rhythm, of, gregorian, chant, and, thus, the, duration, of, the, individual, notes, anyway, adds, to, the, expressivity, of, the, sacred, latin, texts, several, word, related, variables, were, studied, for, their, relationship, with, several, neume, related, variables, exploring, these, relationships, in, a, sample, of, introit, chants, using, such, statistical, methods, as, correlational, analysis, and, multiple, regression, analysis, beside, the, length, of, the, syllables, measured, in, tenths, of, seconds, each, text, syllable, was, evaluated, in, terms, of, its, position, within, the, word, to, which, it, belongs, defining, such, variables, as, the, syllable, has, or, has, not, the, main, accent, the, syllable, is, or, is, not, at, the, end, of, a, word, etc, and, in, terms, of, the, particular, sounds, produced, for, instance, the, syllable, contains, the, vowel, i, the, various, neume, elements, were, evaluated, by, attaching, different, duration, values, to, them, both, in, terms, of, semiological, propositions, nuanced, durations, according, to, the, manner, of, neume, writing, in, chris, hakkennes, graduale, lagal, and, in, terms, of, fixed, duration, values, that, were, based, on, mensuralistic, notions, however, with, ratios, between, short, and, long, notes, ranging, from, 1, 1, via, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, etc, to, 1, 3, to, distinguish, short, and, long, notes, tables, were, consulted, that, were, established, by, van, kampen, in, an, unpublished, comparative, study, regarding, the, neume, notations, according, to, sankt, gallen, and, laon, codices, with, some, exceptions, these, tables, confirm, the, short, vs, long, distinctions, in, cardine, s, semiologie, gregorienne, the, lengths, of, the, neumes, were, given, values, by, adding, up, the, duration, values, for, the, separate, neume, elements, each, time, following, a, particular, hypothesis, concerning, the, rhythm, of, gregoriant, chant, both, the, syllable, lengths, and, the, neume, lengths, were, also, expressed, in, relation, to, the, total, duration, of, the, syllables, resp, neumes, for, a, word, contextual, variables, correlating, the, various, word, and, neume, variables, substantial, correlations, were, found, for, the, word, variables, accented, syllable, and, contextual, syllable, duration, moreover, it, could, be, established, that, the, multiple, correlation, r, between, the, two, types, of, variables, reaches, its, maximum, r, is, about, 0, 80, if, the, neumatic, elements, are, evaluated, according, to, the, following, rules, of, duration, a, neume, elements, that, represent, short, notes, in, neumes, consisting, of, at, least, two, notes, have, duration, values, of, 1, time, b, neume, elements, that, represent, long, notes, in, neumes, consisting, of, at, least, two, notes, have, duration, values, of, 2, times, c, neumes, consisting, of, only, one, note, are, characterized, by, flexible, duration, values, with, an, average, value, of, 2, times, which, take, over, the, duration, values, of, the, syllables, to, match, the, distinction, between, the, first, two, rules, and, the, latter, rule, can, also, be, found, in, early, treatises, on, music, introducing, the, terms, metrum, and, rhythmus, as, it, could, also, be, demonstrated, by, van, kampen, that, melodic, peaks, often, coincide, with, the, word, accent, see, also, the, conclusion, seems, warranted, that, the, gregorian, melodies, enhance, the, expressiveness, of, the, latin, words, by, mimicking, to, some, extent, both, the, accentuation, of, the, sacred, words, pitch, differences, between, neumes, and, the, relative, duration, of, the, word, syllables, by, paying, attention, to, well, defined, length, differences, between, the, individual, notes, of, a, neume, during, the, seventeenth, through, nineteenth, centuries, in, france, the, system, of, rhythmic, notation, became, standardized, with, printers, and, editors, of, chant, books, employing, only, four, rhythmic, values, recent, research, by, christopher, holman, indicates, that, chants, whose, texts, are, in, a, regular, meter, could, even, be, altered, to, be, performed, in, time, signatures, recent, developments, involve, an, intensifying, of, the, semiological, approach, according, to, dom, cardine, which, also, gave, a, new, impetus, to, the, research, into, melodic, variants, in, various, manuscripts, of, chant, on, the, basis, of, this, ongoing, research, it, has, become, obvious, that, the, graduale, and, other, chantbooks, contain, many, melodic, errors, some, very, consistently, the, mis, interpretation, of, third, and, eighth, mode, necessitating, a, new, edition, of, the, graduale, according, to, state, of, the, art, melodic, restitutions, since, the, 1970, a, melodic, restitution, group, of, aiscgre, international, society, for, the, study, of, gregorian, chant, has, worked, on, an, editio, magis, critica, as, requested, by, the, 2, vatican, council, constitution, sacrosanctum, concilium, as, a, response, to, this, need, and, following, the, holy, see, s, invitation, to, edit, a, more, critical, edition, in, 2011, the, first, volume, de, dominicis, et, festis, of, the, graduale, novum, editio, magis, critica, iuxta, sc, 117, was, published, by, libreria, editrice, vatican, and, conbrio, verlagsgesellschaft, regensburg, in, this, approach, the, so, called, earlier, rhythmic, manuscripts, of, unheightened, neumes, that, carry, a, wealth, of, melo, rhythmic, information, but, not, of, exact, pitches, are, compared, in, large, tables, of, comparison, with, relevant, later, melodic, manuscripts, that, are, written, on, lines, or, use, double, alphabetic, and, neumes, notation, over, the, text, but, as, a, rule, have, less, rhythmic, refinement, compared, to, the, earlier, group, however, the, comparison, between, the, two, groups, has, made, it, possible, to, correct, what, are, obvious, mistakes, in, other, instances, it, is, not, so, easy, to, find, a, consensus, in, 1984, chris, hakkennes, published, his, own, transcription, of, the, graduale, triplex, he, devised, a, new, graphic, adaptation, of, square, notation, simplex, in, which, he, integrated, the, rhythmic, indications, of, the, two, most, relevant, sources, that, of, laon, and, sankt, gallen, referring, to, these, manuscripts, he, called, his, own, transcription, gradual, lagal, furthermore, while, making, the, transcription, he, cross, checked, with, the, melodic, manuscripts, to, correct, modal, errors, or, other, melodic, errors, found, in, the, graduale, romanum, his, intention, was, to, provide, a, corrected, melody, in, rhythmic, notation, but, above, all, he, was, also, a, choirmaster, suited, for, practical, use, therefore, a, simplex, integrated, notation, although, fully, admitting, the, importance, of, hakkennes, melodic, revisions, the, rhythmical, solution, suggested, in, the, graduale, lagal, was, actually, found, by, van, kampen, see, above, to, be, rather, modestly, related, to, the, text, of, the, chant, gregorian, chant, is, sung, in, the, office, during, the, canonical, hours, and, in, the, liturgy, of, the, mass, texts, known, as, accentus, are, intoned, by, bishops, priests, and, deacons, mostly, on, a, single, reciting, tone, with, simple, melodic, formulae, at, certain, places, in, each, sentence, more, complex, chants, are, sung, by, trained, soloists, and, choirs, the, graduale, romanum, contains, the, proper, chants, of, the, mass, i, e, introit, gradual, alleluia, tract, offertory, communion, and, the, complete, kyriale, the, collection, of, mass, ordinary, settings, the, liber, usualis, contains, the, chants, for, the, graduale, romanum, and, the, most, commonly, used, office, chants, the, introit, gradual, alleluia, tract, sequence, offertory, and, communion, chants, are, part, of, the, proper, of, the, mass, proprium, missae, in, latin, refers, to, the, chants, of, the, mass, that, have, their, proper, individual, texts, for, each, sunday, throughout, the, annual, cycle, as, opposed, to, ordinarium, missae, which, have, fixed, texts, but, various, melodies, kyrie, sanctus, benedictus, agnus, dei, introits, cover, the, procession, of, the, officiants, introits, are, antiphonal, chants, typically, consisting, of, an, antiphon, a, psalm, verse, a, repeat, of, the, antiphon, an, intonation, of, the, gloria, patri, doxology, and, a, final, repeat, of, the, antiphon, reciting, tones, often, dominate, their, melodic, structures, graduals, are, responsorial, chants, that, follow, the, reading, of, the, epistle, graduals, usually, result, from, centonization, stock, musical, phrases, are, assembled, like,
