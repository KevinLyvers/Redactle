during, the, events, in, question, while, younger, fifth, generation, directors, such, as, tian, tended, to, focus, on, less, controversial, subjects, of, the, immediate, present, or, the, distant, past, official, enthusiasm, for, scar, dramas, waned, by, the, 1990s, when, younger, filmmakers, began, to, confront, negative, aspects, of, the, mao, era, the, blue, kite, though, sharing, a, similar, subject, as, the, earlier, scar, dramas, was, more, realistic, in, style, and, was, made, only, through, obfuscating, its, real, script, shown, abroad, it, was, banned, from, release, in, mainland, china, while, tian, himself, was, banned, from, making, any, films, for, nearly, a, decade, afterward, after, the, 1989, tiananmen, square, protests, and, massacre, few, if, any, scar,

tian, zhuangzhuang, chen, kaige, zhang, junzhao, li, shaohong, wu, ziniu, and, others, these, graduates, constituted, the, first, group, of, filmmakers, to, graduate, since, the, cultural, revolution, and, they, soon, jettisoned, traditional, methods, of, storytelling, and, opted, for, a, more, free, and, unorthodox, symbolic, approach, after, the, so, called, scar, literature, in, fiction, had, paved, the, way, for, frank, discussion, zhang, junzhao, s, one, and, eight, 1983, and, chen, kaige, s, yellow, earth, 1984, in, particular, were, taken, to, mark, the, beginnings, of, the, fifth,

such, as, martin, scorsese, it, was, during, this, period, that, chinese, cinema, began, reaping, the, rewards, of, international, attention, including, the, 1988, golden, bear, for, red, sorghum, the, 1992, golden, lion, for, the, story, of, qiu, ju, the, 1993, palme, d, or, for, farewell, my, concubine, and, three, best, foreign, language, film, nominations, from, the, academy, awards, all,

the, drama, of, ordinary, people, s, daily, lives, they, also, retained, political, edge, but, aimed, at, exploring, issues, rather, than, recycling, approved, policy, while, cultural, revolution, films, used, character, the, younger, directors, favored, psychological, depth, along, the, lines, of, european, cinema, they, adopted, complex, plots, ambiguous, symbolism, and, evocative, imagery, some, of, their, bolder, works, with, political, overtones, were, banned, by, chinese, authorities, these, films, came, with, a, creative, genres, of, stories, new, style, of, shooting, as, well, directors, utilized, extensive, color, and, long, shots, to, present, and, explore, history, and, structure, of, national, culture, as, a, result, of, the, new, films, being, so, intricate, the, films, were, for, more, educated, audiences, than, anything, the, new, style, was, profitable, for, some, and, helped, filmmakers, to, make, strides, in, the, business, it, allowed, directors, to, get, away, from, reality, and, show, their, artistic, sense, the, fourth, generation, also, returned, to, prominence, given, their, label, after, the, rise, of, the, fifth, generation, these, were, directors, whose, careers, were, stalled, by, the, cultural, revolution, and, who, were, professionally, trained, prior, to, 1966, wu, tianming, in, particular, made, outstanding, contributions, by,
