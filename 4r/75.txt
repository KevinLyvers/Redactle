the, national, gallery, is, an, art, museum, in, trafalgar, square, in, the, city, of, westminster, in, central, london, england, founded, in, 1824, it, houses, a, collection, of, more, than, 2, 300, paintings, dating, from, the, mid, 13th, century, to, 1900, the, current, director, of, the, national, gallery, is, gabriele, finaldi, the, national, gallery, is, an, exempt, charity, and, a, non, departmental, public, body, of, the, department, for, culture, media, and, sport, its, collection, belongs, to, the, government, on, behalf, of, the, british, public, and, entry, to, the, main, collection, is, free, of, charge, unlike, comparable, museums, in, continental, europe, the, national, gallery, was, not, formed, by, nationalising, an, existing, royal, or, princely, art, collection, it, came, into, being, when, the, british, government, bought, 38, paintings, from, the, heirs, of, john, julius, angerstein, in, 1824, after, that, initial, purchase, the, gallery, was, shaped, mainly, by, its, early, directors, especially, charles, lock, eastlake, and, by, private, donations, which, now, account, for, two, thirds, of, the, collection, the, collection, is, smaller, than, many, european, national, galleries, but, encyclopaedic, in, scope, most, major, developments, in, western, painting, from, giotto, to, c, zanne, are, represented, with, important, works, it, used, to, be, claimed, that, this, was, one, of, the, few, national, galleries, that, had, all, its, works, on, permanent, exhibition, but, this, is, no, longer, the, case, the, present, building, the, third, site, to, house, the, national, gallery, was, designed, by, william, wilkins, building, began, in, 1832, and, it, opened, to, the, public, in, 1838, only, the, fa, ade, onto, trafalgar, square, remains, essentially, unchanged, from, this, time, as, the, building, has, been, expanded, piecemeal, throughout, its, history, wilkins, s, building, was, often, criticised, for, the, perceived, weaknesses, of, its, design, and, for, its, lack, of, space, the, latter, problem, led, to, the, establishment, of, the, tate, gallery, for, british, art, in, 1897, the, sainsbury, wing, a, 1991, extension, to, the, west, by, robert, venturi, and, denise, scott, brown, is, a, significant, example, of, postmodernist, architecture, in, britain, the, late, 18th, century, saw, the, nationalisation, of, royal, or, princely, art, collections, across, mainland, europe, the, bavarian, royal, collection, now, in, the, alte, pinakothek, munich, opened, to, the, public, in, 1779, that, of, the, medici, in, florence, around, 1789, as, the, uffizi, gallery, and, the, museum, fran, ais, at, the, louvre, was, formed, out, of, the, former, french, royal, collection, in, 1793, great, britain, however, did, not, follow, other, european, countries, and, the, british, royal, collection, still, remains, in, the, sovereign, s, possession, in, 1777, the, british, government, had, the, opportunity, to, buy, an, art, collection, of, international, stature, when, the, descendants, of, sir, robert, walpole, put, his, collection, up, for, sale, the, mp, john, wilkes, argued, for, the, government, to, buy, this, invaluable, treasure, and, suggested, that, it, be, housed, in, a, noble, gallery, to, be, built, in, the, spacious, garden, of, the, british, museum, nothing, came, of, wilkes, s, appeal, and, 20, years, later, the, collection, was, bought, in, its, entirety, by, catherine, the, great, it, is, now, to, be, found, in, the, state, hermitage, museum, in, saint, petersburg, a, plan, to, acquire, 150, paintings, from, the, orl, ans, collection, which, had, been, brought, to, london, for, sale, in, 1798, also, failed, despite, the, interest, of, both, the, king, and, the, prime, minister, pitt, the, younger, the, twenty, five, paintings, from, that, collection, now, in, the, gallery, including, ng1, arrived, later, by, a, variety, of, routes, in, 1799, the, dealer, no, l, desenfans, offered, a, ready, made, national, collection, to, the, british, government, he, and, his, partner, sir, francis, bourgeois, had, assembled, it, for, the, king, of, poland, before, the, third, partition, in, 1795, abolished, polish, independence, this, offer, was, declined, and, bourgeois, bequeathed, the, collection, to, his, old, school, dulwich, college, on, his, death, the, collection, opened, in, 1814, in, britain, s, first, purpose, built, public, gallery, the, dulwich, picture, gallery, the, scottish, dealer, william, buchanan, and, the, collector, joseph, count, truchsess, both, formed, art, collections, expressly, as, the, basis, for, a, future, national, collection, but, their, respective, offers, both, made, in, 1803, were, also, declined, following, the, walpole, sale, many, artists, including, james, barry, and, john, flaxman, had, made, renewed, calls, for, the, establishment, of, a, national, gallery, arguing, that, a, british, school, of, painting, could, only, flourish, if, it, had, access, to, the, canon, of, european, painting, the, british, institution, founded, in, 1805, by, a, group, of, aristocratic, connoisseurs, attempted, to, address, this, situation, the, members, lent, works, to, exhibitions, that, changed, annually, while, an, art, school, was, held, in, the, summer, months, however, as, the, paintings, that, were, lent, were, often, mediocre, some, artists, resented, the, institution, and, saw, it, as, a, racket, for, the, gentry, to, increase, the, sale, prices, of, their, old, master, paintings, one, of, the, institution, s, founding, members, sir, george, beaumont, bt, would, eventually, play, a, major, role, in, the, national, gallery, s, foundation, by, offering, a, gift, of, 16, paintings, in, 1823, another, major, art, collection, came, on, the, market, which, had, been, assembled, by, the, recently, deceased, john, julius, angerstein, angerstein, was, a, russian, born, migr, banker, based, in, london, his, collection, numbered, 38, paintings, including, works, by, raphael, and, hogarth, s, marriage, a, la, mode, series, on, 1, july, 1823, george, agar, ellis, a, whig, politician, proposed, to, the, house, of, commons, that, it, purchase, the, collection, the, appeal, was, given, added, impetus, by, beaumont, s, offer, which, came, with, two, conditions, that, the, government, buy, the, angerstein, collection, and, that, a, suitable, building, was, to, be, found, the, unexpected, repayment, of, a, war, debt, by, austria, finally, moved, the, government, to, buy, angerstein, s, collection, for, 57, 000, the, national, gallery, opened, in, 1824, in, angerstein, s, former, townhouse, at, no, 100, pall, mall, angerstein, s, paintings, were, joined, in, 1826, by, those, from, beaumont, s, collection, and, in, 1831, by, the, reverend, william, holwell, carr, s, bequest, of, 35, paintings, initially, the, keeper, of, paintings, william, seguier, bore, the, burden, of, managing, the, gallery, but, in, july, 1824, some, of, this, responsibility, fell, to, the, newly, formed, board, of, trustees, the, national, gallery, at, pall, mall, was, frequently, overcrowded, and, hot, and, its, diminutive, size, in, comparison, with, the, louvre, in, paris, was, a, cause, of, national, embarrassment, but, agar, ellis, by, then, a, trustee, of, the, gallery, appraised, the, site, for, being, in, the, very, gangway, of, london, this, was, seen, as, necessary, for, the, gallery, to, fulfil, its, social, purpose, subsidence, in, no, 100, caused, the, gallery, to, move, briefly, to, no, 105, pall, mall, which, the, novelist, anthony, trollope, described, as, a, dingy, dull, narrow, house, ill, adapted, for, the, exhibition, of, the, treasures, it, held, this, in, turn, had, to, be, demolished, for, the, opening, of, a, road, to, carlton, house, terrace, in, 1832, construction, began, on, a, new, building, by, william, wilkins, on, the, northern, half, of, the, site, of, the, old, royal, mews, in, charing, cross, after, the, transformation, of, its, southern, half, into, trafalgar, square, in, the, late, 1820s, the, location, was, a, significant, one, between, the, wealthy, west, end, and, poorer, areas, to, the, east, the, argument, that, the, collection, could, be, accessed, by, people, of, all, social, classes, outstripped, other, concerns, such, as, the, pollution, of, central, london, or, the, failings, of, wilkins, s, building, when, the, prospect, of, a, move, to, south, kensington, was, mooted, in, the, 1850s, according, to, the, parliamentary, commission, of, 1857, the, existence, of, the, pictures, is, not, the, end, purpose, of, the, collection, but, the, means, only, to, give, the, people, an, ennobling, enjoyment, 15th, and, 16th, century, italian, paintings, were, at, the, core, of, the, national, gallery, and, for, the, first, 30, years, of, its, existence, the, trustees, independent, acquisitions, were, mainly, limited, to, works, by, high, renaissance, masters, their, conservative, tastes, resulted, in, several, missed, opportunities, and, the, management, of, the, gallery, later, fell, into, complete, disarray, with, no, acquisitions, being, made, between, 1847, and, 1850, a, critical, house, of, commons, report, in, 1851, called, for, the, appointment, of, a, director, whose, authority, would, surpass, that, of, the, trustees, many, thought, the, position, would, go, to, the, german, art, historian, gustav, friedrich, waagen, whom, the, gallery, had, consulted, on, previous, occasions, about, the, lighting, and, display, of, the, collections, however, the, man, preferred, for, the, job, by, queen, victoria, prince, albert, and, the, prime, minister, lord, russell, was, the, keeper, of, paintings, at, the, gallery, sir, charles, lock, eastlake, eastlake, who, was, president, of, the, royal, academy, played, an, essential, role, in, the, foundation, of, the, arundel, society, and, knew, most, of, london, s, leading, art, experts, the, new, director, s, taste, was, for, the, northern, and, early, italian, renaissance, masters, or, primitives, who, had, been, neglected, by, the, gallery, s, acquisitions, policy, but, were, slowly, gaining, recognition, from, connoisseurs, he, made, annual, tours, to, the, continent, and, to, italy, in, particular, seeking, out, appropriate, paintings, to, buy, for, the, gallery, in, all, he, bought, 148, pictures, abroad, and, 46, in, britain, among, the, former, such, seminal, works, as, paolo, uccello, s, battle, of, san, romano, eastlake, also, amassed, a, private, art, collection, during, this, period, consisting, of, paintings, that, he, knew, did, not, interest, the, trustees, his, ultimate, aim, however, was, for, them, to, enter, the, national, gallery, this, was, duly, arranged, upon, his, death, by, his, friend, and, successor, as, director, william, boxall, and, his, widow, lady, eastlake, one, of, the, most, persistent, criticisms, of, the, national, gallery, other, than, of, the, perceived, inadequacies, of, the, building, has, been, of, its, conservation, policy, the, gallery, s, detractors, have, accused, it, of, having, had, an, over, zealous, approach, to, restoration, the, first, cleaning, operation, at, the, national, gallery, began, in, 1844, after, eastlake, s, appointment, as, keeper, and, was, the, subject, of, attacks, in, the, press, after, the, first, three, paintings, to, receive, the, treatment, a, rubens, a, cuyp, and, a, vel, zquez, were, unveiled, to, the, public, in, 1846, the, gallery, s, most, virulent, critic, was, j, morris, moore, who, wrote, a, series, of, letters, to, the, times, under, the, pseudonym, verax, savaging, the, institution, s, cleanings, while, an, 1853, parliamentary, select, committee, set, up, to, investigate, the, matter, cleared, the, gallery, of, any, wrongdoing, criticism, of, its, methods, has, been, erupting, sporadically, ever, since, from, some, in, the, art, establishment, the, gallery, s, lack, of, space, remained, acute, in, this, period, in, 1845, a, large, bequest, of, british, paintings, was, made, by, robert, vernon, there, was, insufficient, room, in, the, wilkins, building, so, they, were, displayed, first, in, vernon, s, town, house, at, no, 50, pall, mall, and, then, at, marlborough, house, the, gallery, was, even, less, well, equipped, for, its, next, major, bequest, as, j, m, w, turner, was, to, bequeath, the, entire, contents, of, his, studio, excepting, unfinished, works, to, the, nation, upon, his, death, in, 1851, the, first, 20, of, these, were, displayed, off, site, in, marlborough, house, in, 1856, ralph, nicholson, wornum, the, gallery, s, keeper, and, secretary, worked, with, john, ruskin, to, bring, the, bequest, together, the, stipulation, in, turner, s, will, that, two, of, his, paintings, be, displayed, alongside, works, by, claude, is, still, honoured, as, of, 2024, but, his, bequest, has, never, been, adequately, displayed, in, its, entirety, today, the, works, are, divided, between, trafalgar, square, and, the, clore, gallery, a, small, purpose, built, extension, to, tate, britain, completed, in, 1985, the, third, director, sir, frederic, william, burton, laid, the, foundations, of, the, collection, of, 18th, century, art, and, made, several, outstanding, purchases, from, english, private, collections, the, acquisition, in, 1885, of, two, paintings, from, blenheim, palace, raphael, s, ansidei, madonna, and, van, dyck, s, equestrian, portrait, of, charles, i, with, a, record, setting, grant, of, 87, 500, from, the, treasury, brought, the, gallery, s, golden, age, of, collecting, to, an, end, as, its, annual, purchase, grant, was, suspended, for, several, years, thereafter, when, the, gallery, purchased, holbein, s, ambassadors, from, the, earl, of, radnor, in, 1890, it, did, so, with, the, aid, of, private, individuals, for, the, first, time, in, its, history, in, 1897, the, formation, of, the, national, gallery, of, british, art, known, unofficially, from, early, in, its, history, as, the, tate, gallery, allowed, some, british, works, to, be, moved, off, site, following, the, precedent, set, by, the, vernon, collection, and, the, turner, bequest, works, by, artists, born, after, 1790, were, moved, to, the, new, gallery, on, millbank, which, allowed, hogarth, turner, and, constable, to, remain, in, trafalgar, square, the, agricultural, crisis, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, caused, many, aristocratic, families, to, sell, their, paintings, but, the, british, national, collections, were, priced, out, of, the, market, by, american, plutocrats, this, prompted, the, foundation, of, the, national, art, collections, fund, a, society, of, subscribers, dedicated, to, stemming, the, flow, of, artworks, to, the, united, states, their, first, acquisition, for, the, national, gallery, was, vel, zquez, s, rokeby, venus, in, 1906, followed, by, holbein, s, portrait, of, christina, of, denmark, in, 1909, however, despite, the, crisis, in, aristocratic, fortunes, the, following, decade, was, one, of, several, great, bequests, from, private, collectors, in, 1909, the, industrialist, ludwig, mond, gave, 42, italian, renaissance, paintings, including, the, mond, crucifixion, by, raphael, to, the, gallery, other, bequests, of, note, were, those, of, george, salting, in, 1910, austen, henry, layard, in, 1916, and, sir, hugh, lane, in, 1917, the, initial, reception, of, impressionist, art, at, the, gallery, was, exceptionally, controversial, in, 1906, sir, hugh, lane, promised, 39, paintings, including, renoir, s, umbrellas, to, the, national, gallery, on, his, death, unless, a, suitable, building, could, be, built, in, dublin, although, eagerly, accepted, by, the, director, charles, holroyd, they, were, received, with, extreme, hostility, by, the, trustees, lord, redesdale, wrote, that, i, would, as, soon, expect, to, hear, of, a, mormon, service, being, conducted, in, st, paul, s, cathedral, as, to, see, the, exhibition, of, the, works, of, the, modern, french, art, rebels, in, the, sacred, precincts, of, trafalgar, square, perhaps, as, a, result, of, such, attitudes, lane, amended, his, will, with, a, codicil, that, the, works, should, only, go, to, ireland, but, crucially, this, was, never, witnessed, lane, died, on, board, the, rms, lusitania, in, 1915, and, a, dispute, began, which, was, not, resolved, until, 1959, part, of, the, collection, is, now, on, permanent, loan, to, dublin, city, gallery, the, hugh, lane, and, other, works, rotate, between, london, and, dublin, every, few, years, a, fund, for, the, purchase, of, modern, paintings, established, by, samuel, courtauld, in, 1923, bought, seurat, s, bathers, at, asni, res, and, other, modern, works, for, the, nation, in, 1934, many, of, these, were, transferred, to, the, national, gallery, from, the, tate, the, director, kenneth, clark, s, decision, in, 1939, to, label, a, group, of, venetian, paintings, scenes, from, tebaldeo, s, eclogues, as, works, by, giorgione, was, controversial, at, the, time, and, the, panels, were, soon, identified, as, works, by, andrea, previtali, by, a, junior, curator, clark, had, appointed, shortly, before, the, outbreak, of, the, second, world, war, the, paintings, were, evacuated, to, locations, in, wales, including, penrhyn, castle, and, the, university, colleges, of, bangor, and, aberystwyth, in, 1940, during, the, battle, of, france, a, more, secure, home, was, sought, and, there, were, discussions, about, moving, the, paintings, to, canada, this, idea, was, firmly, rejected, by, winston, churchill, who, wrote, in, a, telegram, to, kenneth, clark, bury, them, in, caves, or, in, cellars, but, not, a, picture, shall, leave, these, islands, instead, a, slate, quarry, at, manod, near, blaenau, ffestiniog, in, north, wales, was, requisitioned, for, the, gallery, s, use, in, the, seclusion, afforded, by, the, paintings, new, location, the, keeper, and, future, director, martin, davies, began, to, compile, scholarly, catalogues, on, the, collection, with, assistance, of, the, gallery, s, library, which, was, also, stored, in, the, quarry, the, move, to, manod, confirmed, the, importance, of, storing, paintings, at, a, constant, temperature, and, humidity, something, the, gallery, s, conservators, had, long, suspected, but, had, hitherto, been, unable, to, prove, this, eventually, resulted, in, the, first, air, conditioned, gallery, opening, in, 1949, for, the, course, of, the, war, myra, hess, and, other, musicians, such, as, moura, lympany, gave, daily, lunch, time, recitals, in, the, empty, building, in, trafalgar, square, to, raise, public, morale, as, every, concert, hall, in, london, was, closed, art, exhibitions, were, held, at, the, gallery, as, a, complement, to, the, recitals, the, first, of, these, was, british, painting, since, whistler, in, 1940, organised, by, lillian, browse, who, also, mounted, the, major, joint, retrospective, exhibition, of, paintings, by, sir, william, nicholson, and, jack, b, yeats, held, from, 1, january, to, 15, march, 1942, which, was, seen, by, 10, 518, visitors, exhibitions, of, work, by, war, artists, including, paul, nash, henry, moore, and, stanley, spencer, were, also, held, the, war, artists, advisory, committee, had, been, set, up, by, clark, in, order, to, keep, artists, at, work, on, any, pretext, in, 1941, a, request, from, an, artist, to, see, rembrandt, s, portrait, of, margaretha, de, geer, a, new, acquisition, resulted, in, the, picture, of, the, month, scheme, in, which, a, single, painting, was, removed, from, manod, and, exhibited, to, the, general, public, in, the, national, gallery, each, month, the, art, critic, herbert, read, writing, that, year, called, the, national, gallery, a, defiant, outpost, of, culture, right, in, the, middle, of, a, bombed, and, shattered, metropolis, the, paintings, returned, to, trafalgar, square, in, 1945, the, last, major, outcry, against, the, use, of, radical, conservation, techniques, at, the, national, gallery, was, in, the, immediate, post, war, years, following, a, restoration, campaign, by, the, gallery, s, chief, restorer, helmut, ruhemann, while, the, paintings, were, in, manod, quarry, when, the, cleaned, pictures, were, exhibited, to, the, public, in, 1946, there, followed, a, furore, with, parallels, to, that, of, a, century, earlier, the, principal, criticism, was, that, the, extensive, removal, of, varnish, which, was, used, in, the, 19th, century, to, protect, the, surface, of, paintings, but, which, darkened, and, discoloured, over, time, may, have, resulted, in, the, loss, of, harmonising, glazes, added, to, the, paintings, by, the, artists, themselves, the, opposition, to, ruhemann, s, techniques, was, led, by, ernst, gombrich, a, professor, at, the, warburg, institute, who, in, later, correspondence, with, a, restorer, described, being, treated, with, offensive, superciliousness, by, the, national, gallery, a, 1947, commission, concluded, that, no, damage, had, been, done, in, the, recent, cleanings, in, the, post, war, years, acquisitions, have, become, increasingly, difficult, for, the, national, gallery, as, the, prices, for, old, masters, and, even, more, so, for, the, impressionists, and, post, impressionists, have, risen, beyond, its, means, some, of, the, gallery, s, most, significant, purchases, in, this, period, would, have, been, impossible, without, the, major, public, appeals, backing, them, including, leonardo, da, vinci, s, cartoon, of, the, virgin, and, child, with, saint, anne, and, saint, john, the, baptist, bought, in, 1962, and, titian, s, death, of, actaeon, bought, in, 1972, the, gallery, s, purchase, grant, from, the, government, was, frozen, in, 1985, but, later, that, year, it, received, an, endowment, of, 50, million, from, sir, paul, getty, enabling, many, major, purchases, to, be, made, in, april, 1985, lord, sainsbury, of, preston, candover, and, his, brothers, the, hon, simon, sainsbury, and, sir, timothy, sainsbury, had, made, a, donation, that, would, enable, the, construction, of, the, sainsbury, wing, the, directorship, of, neil, macgregor, saw, a, major, rehang, at, the, gallery, dispensing, with, the, classification, of, paintings, by, national, school, that, had, been, introduced, by, eastlake, the, new, chronological, hang, sought, to, emphasise, the, interaction, between, cultures, rather, than, fixed, national, characteristics, reflecting, the, change, in, art, historical, values, since, the, 19th, century, in, other, respects, however, victorian, tastes, were, rehabilitated, the, building, s, interiors, were, no, longer, considered, an, embarrassment, and, were, restored, and, in, 1999, the, gallery, accepted, a, bequest, of, 26, italian, baroque, paintings, from, sir, denis, mahon, earlier, in, the, 20th, century, many, considered, the, baroque, to, be, beyond, the, pale, in, 1945, the, gallery, s, trustees, declined, to, buy, a, guercino, from, mahon, s, collection, for, 200, the, same, painting, was, valued, at, 4, million, in, 2003, mahon, s, bequest, was, made, on, the, condition, that, the, gallery, would, never, deaccession, any, of, its, paintings, or, charge, for, admission, jock, mcfadyen, was, the, first, artist, in, residence, in, 1981, since, 1989, the, gallery, has, run, an, associate, artist, scheme, that, gives, a, studio, to, contemporary, artists, to, create, work, based, on, the, permanent, collection, they, usually, hold, the, position, of, associate, artist, for, two, years, and, are, given, an, exhibition, in, the, national, gallery, at, the, end, of, their, tenure, the, respective, remits, of, the, national, and, tate, galleries, which, had, long, been, contested, by, the, two, institutions, were, more, clearly, defined, in, 1996, 1900, was, established, as, the, cut, off, point, for, paintings, in, the, national, gallery, and, in, 1997, more, than, 60, post, 1900, paintings, from, the, collection, were, given, to, the, tate, on, a, long, term, loan, in, return, for, works, by, gauguin, and, others, however, future, expansion, of, the, national, gallery, may, yet, see, the, return, of, 20th, century, paintings, to, its, walls, in, the, 21st, century, there, have, been, three, large, fundraising, campaigns, at, the, gallery, in, 2004, to, buy, raphael, s, madonna, of, the, pinks, in, 2008, for, titian, s, diana, and, actaeon, and, in, 2012, titian, s, diana, and, callisto, both, titians, were, bought, in, tandem, with, the, national, gallery, of, scotland, for, 95, m, both, of, these, major, works, were, sold, from, the, collection, of, the, duke, of, sutherland, the, national, gallery, is, now, largely, priced, out, of, the, market, for, old, master, paintings, and, can, only, make, such, acquisitions, with, the, backing, of, major, public, appeals, the, departing, director, charles, saumarez, smith, expressed, his, frustration, at, this, situation, in, 2007, the, national, gallery, was, sponsored, by, the, italian, arms, manufacturer, finmeccanica, between, october, 2011, and, october, 2012, the, sponsorship, deal, allowed, the, company, to, use, gallery, spaces, for, gatherings, and, the, gallery, was, used, to, host, delegates, during, the, dsei, arms, fair, and, the, farnborough, airshow, the, sponsorship, deal, was, ended, a, year, early, after, protests, in, february, 2014, the, gallery, purchased, men, of, the, docks, by, the, american, artist, george, bellows, for, 25, 5, million, 15, 6, million, it, was, the, first, major, american, painting, to, be, purchased, by, the, gallery, the, director, nicholas, penny, termed, the, painting, a, new, direction, for, the, gallery, a, non, european, painting, in, a, european, style, its, sale, was, controversial, in, the, united, states, in, 2018, the, national, gallery, was, one, of, the, first, public, galleries, in, london, to, charge, more, than, 20, for, admission, to, a, special, exhibition, the, exhibition, in, question, being, of, works, by, claude, monet, in, february, 2019, an, employment, tribunal, ruled, that, the, gallery, had, incorrectly, classed, its, team, of, educators, as, self, employed, contractors, the, educators, were, awarded, the, status, of, workers, following, legal, action, brought, by, 27, claimants, the, case, received, considerable, press, and, media, coverage, in, 2024, the, national, gallery, celebrated, its, 200th, anniversary, with, a, range, of, programmes, events, and, collaborations, the, first, suggestion, for, a, national, gallery, on, trafalgar, square, came, from, john, nash, who, envisaged, it, on, the, site, of, the, king, s, mews, while, a, parthenon, like, building, for, the, royal, academy, would, occupy, the, centre, of, the, square, economic, recession, prevented, this, scheme, from, being, built, but, a, competition, for, the, mews, site, was, eventually, held, in, 1831, for, which, nash, submitted, a, design, with, c, r, cockerell, as, his, co, architect, nash, s, popularity, was, waning, by, this, time, however, and, the, commission, was, awarded, to, william, wilkins, who, was, involved, in, the, selection, of, the, site, and, submitted, some, drawings, at, the, last, moment, wilkins, had, hoped, to, build, a, temple, of, the, arts, nurturing, contemporary, art, through, historical, example, but, the, commission, was, blighted, by, parsimony, and, compromise, and, the, resulting, building, which, opened, to, the, public, on, 9, april, 1838, was, deemed, a, failure, on, almost, all, counts, the, site, only, allowed, for, the, building, to, be, one, room, deep, as, a, workhouse, and, a, barracks, lay, immediately, behind, to, exacerbate, matters, there, was, a, public, right, of, way, through, the, site, to, these, buildings, which, accounts, for, the, access, porticoes, on, the, eastern, and, western, sides, of, the, fa, ade, these, had, to, incorporate, columns, from, the, demolished, carlton, house, and, their, relative, shortness, resulted, in, an, elevation, that, was, deemed, excessively, low, thus, failing, to, provide, trafalgar, square, with, its, desired, commanding, focal, point, to, the, north, also, recycled, are, the, sculptures, on, the, fa, ade, originally, intended, for, nash, s, marble, arch, but, abandoned, due, to, his, financial, problems, the, eastern, half, of, the, building, housed, the, royal, academy, until, 1868, which, further, diminished, the, space, afforded, to, the, national, gallery, the, building, was, the, object, of, public, ridicule, before, it, had, even, been, completed, as, a, version, of, the, design, had, been, leaked, to, the, literary, gazette, in, 1833, two, years, before, completion, its, infamous, pepperpot, elevation, appeared, on, the, frontispiece, of, contrasts, 1836, an, influential, tract, by, the, gothicist, a, w, n, pugin, as, an, example, of, the, degeneracy, of, the, classical, style, even, william, iv, in, his, last, recorded, utterance, thought, the, building, a, nasty, little, pokey, hole, while, william, makepeace, thackeray, called, it, a, little, gin, shop, of, a, building, the, twentieth, century, architectural, historian, sir, john, summerson, echoed, these, early, criticisms, when, he, compared, the, arrangement, of, a, dome, and, two, diminutive, turrets, on, the, roofline, to, the, clock, and, vases, on, a, mantelpiece, only, less, useful, sir, charles, barry, s, landscaping, of, trafalgar, square, from, 1840, included, a, north, terrace, so, that, the, building, would, appear, to, be, raised, thus, addressing, one, of, the, points, of, complaint, opinion, on, the, building, had, mellowed, considerably, by, 1984, when, prince, charles, called, the, wilkins, fa, ade, a, much, loved, and, elegant, friend, in, contrast, to, a, proposed, extension, see, below, the, first, significant, alteration, made, to, the, building, was, the, single, long, gallery, added, by, sir, james, pennethorne, in, 1860, 1861, ornately, decorated, in, comparison, with, the, rooms, by, wilkins, it, nonetheless, worsened, the, cramped, conditions, inside, the, building, as, it, was, built, over, the, original, entrance, hall, unsurprisingly, several, attempts, were, made, either, to, completely, remodel, the, national, gallery, as, suggested, by, sir, charles, barry, in, 1853, or, to, move, it, to, more, capacious, premises, in, kensington, where, the, air, was, also, cleaner, in, 1867, barry, s, son, edward, middleton, barry, proposed, to, replace, the, wilkins, building, with, a, massive, classical, building, with, four, domes, the, scheme, was, a, failure, and, contemporary, critics, denounced, the, exterior, as, a, strong, plagiarism, upon, st, paul, s, cathedral, with, the, demolition, of, the, workhouse, however, barry, was, able, to, build, the, gallery, s, first, sequence, of, grand, architectural, spaces, from, 1872, to, 1876, built, to, a, polychrome, neo, renaissance, design, the, barry, rooms, were, arranged, on, a, greek, cross, plan, around, a, huge, central, octagon, though, it, compensated, for, the, underwhelming, architecture, of, the, wilkins, building, barry, s, new, wing, was, disliked, by, gallery, staff, who, considered, its, monumental, aspect, to, be, in, conflict, with, its, function, as, exhibition, space, also, the, decorative, programme, of, the, rooms, did, not, take, their, intended, contents, into, account, the, ceiling, of, the, 15th, and, 16th, century, italian, gallery, for, instance, was, inscribed, with, the, names, of, british, artists, of, the, 19th, century, however, despite, these, failures, the, barry, rooms, provided, the, gallery, with, a, strong, axial, groundplan, this, was, to, be, followed, by, all, subsequent, additions, to, the, gallery, for, a, century, resulting, in, a, building, of, clear, symmetry, pennethorne, s, gallery, was, demolished, for, the, next, phase, of, building, a, scheme, by, sir, john, taylor, extending, northwards, of, the, main, entrance, its, glass, domed, entrance, vestibule, had, painted, ceiling, decorations, by, the, crace, family, firm, who, had, also, worked, on, the, barry, rooms, a, fresco, intended, for, the, south, wall, was, never, realised, later, additions, to, the, west, came, more, steadily, but, maintained, the, coherence, of, the, building, by, mirroring, barry, s, cross, axis, plan, to, the, east, the, use, of, dark, marble, for, doorcases, was, also, continued, giving, the, extensions, a, degree, of, internal, consistency, with, the, older, rooms, the, classical, style, was, still, in, use, at, the, national, gallery, in, 1929, when, a, beaux, arts, style, gallery, was, built, funded, by, the, art, dealer, and, trustee, lord, duveen, however, it, was, not, long, before, the, 20th, century, reaction, against, victorian, attitudes, became, manifest, at, the, gallery, from, 1928, to, 1952, the, landing, floors, of, taylor, s, entrance, hall, were, relaid, with, a, new, series, of, mosaics, by, boris, anrep, who, was, friendly, with, the, bloomsbury, group, these, mosaics, can, be, read, as, a, satire, on, 19th, century, conventions, for, the, decoration, of, public, buildings, as, typified, by, the, albert, memorial, s, frieze, of, parnassus, the, central, mosaic, depicting, the, awakening, of, the, muses, includes, portraits, of, virginia, woolf, and, greta, garbo, subverting, the, high, moral, tone, of, its, victorian, forebears, in, place, of, christianity, s, seven, virtues, anrep, offered, his, own, set, of, modern, virtues, including, humour, and, open, mind, the, allegorical, figures, are, again, portraits, of, his, contemporaries, including, winston, churchill, bertrand, russell, and, t, s, eliot, in, the, 20th, century, the, gallery, s, late, victorian, interiors, fell, out, of, fashion, the, crace, ceiling, decorations, in, the, entrance, hall, were, not, to, the, taste, of, the, director, charles, holmes, and, were, obliterated, by, white, paint, the, north, galleries, which, opened, to, the, public, in, 1975, marked, the, arrival, of, modernist, architecture, at, the, national, gallery, in, the, older, rooms, the, original, classical, details, were, effaced, by, partitions, daises, and, suspended, ceilings, the, aim, being, to, create, neutral, settings, which, did, not, distract, from, contemplation, of, the, paintings, but, the, gallery, s, commitment, to, modernism, was, short, lived, by, the, 1980s, victorian, style, was, no, longer, considered, anathema, and, a, restoration, programme, began, to, restore, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, interiors, to, their, purported, original, appearance, this, began, with, the, refurbishment, of, the, barry, rooms, in, 1985, 1986, from, 1996, to, 1999, even, the, north, galleries, by, then, considered, to, lack, a, positive, architectural, character, were, remodelled, in, a, classical, style, albeit, a, simplified, one, the, most, important, addition, to, the, building, in, the, late, 20th, century, was, the, sainsbury, wing, designed, by, the, postmodernist, architects, robert, venturi, and, denise, scott, brown, to, house, the, collection, of, renaissance, paintings, and, built, in, 1991, the, building, occupies, the, hampton, s, site, to, the, west, of, the, main, building, where, a, department, store, of, the, same, name, had, stood, until, its, destruction, in, the, blitz, the, gallery, had, long, sought, expansion, into, this, space, and, in, 1982, a, competition, was, held, to, find, a, suitable, architect, the, shortlist, included, a, radical, high, tech, proposal, by, richard, rogers, among, others, the, design, that, won, the, most, votes, was, by, the, firm, ahrends, burton, and, koralek, who, then, modified, their, proposal, to, include, a, tower, similar, to, that, of, the, rogers, scheme, the, proposal, was, dropped, after, the, prince, of, wales, compared, the, design, to, a, monstrous, carbuncle, on, the, face, of, a, much, loved, and, elegant, friend, the, term, monstrous, carbuncle, for, a, modern, building, that, clashes, with, its, surroundings, has, since, become, commonplace, one, of, the, conditions, of, the, 1982, competition, was, that, the, new, wing, had, to, include, commercial, offices, as, well, as, public, gallery, space, however, in, 1985, it, became, possible, to, devote, the, extension, entirely, to, the, gallery, s, uses, due, to, a, donation, of, almost, 50, million, from, lord, sainsbury, and, his, brothers, simon, and, sir, tim, sainsbury, a, closed, competition, was, held, and, the, schemes, produced, were, noticeably, more, restrained, than, in, the, earlier, competition, in, contrast, with, the, rich, ornamentation, of, the, main, building, the, galleries, in, the, sainsbury, wing, are, pared, down, and, intimate, to, suit, the, smaller, scale, of, many, of, the, paintings, the, main, inspirations, for, these, rooms, are, sir, john, soane, s, toplit, galleries, for, the, dulwich, picture, gallery, and, the, church, interiors, of, filippo, brunelleschi, the, stone, dressing, is, in, pietra, serena, the, grey, stone, local, to, florence, the, northernmost, galleries, align, with, barry, s, central, axis, so, that, there, is, a, single, vista, down, the, whole, length, of, the, gallery, this, axis, is, exaggerated, by, the, use, of, false, perspective, as, the, columns, flanking, each, opening, gradually, diminish, in, size, until, the, visitor, reaches, the, focal, point, as, of, 2009, an, altarpiece, by, cima, of, the, incredulity, of, saint, thomas, venturi, s, postmodernist, approach, to, architecture, is, in, full, evidence, at, the, sainsbury, wing, with, its, stylistic, quotations, from, buildings, as, disparate, as, the, clubhouses, on, pall, mall, the, scala, regia, in, the, vatican, victorian, warehouses, and, ancient, egyptian, temples, following, the, pedestrianisation, of, trafalgar, square, the, gallery, is, currently, engaged, in, a, masterplan, to, convert, the, vacated, office, space, on, the, ground, floor, into, public, space, the, plan, will, also, fill, in, disused, courtyards, and, make, use, of, land, acquired, from, the, adjoining, national, portrait, gallery, in, st, martin, s, place, which, it, gave, to, the, national, gallery, in, exchange, for, land, for, its, 2000, extension, the, first, phase, the, east, wing, project, designed, by, jeremy, dixon, and, edward, jones, opened, to, the, public, in, 2004, this, provided, a, new, ground, level, entrance, from, trafalgar, square, named, in, honour, of, sir, paul, getty, the, main, entrance, was, also, refurbished, and, reopened, in, september, 2005, possible, future, projects, include, a, west, wing, project, roughly, symmetrical, with, the, east, wing, project, which, would, provide, a, future, ground, level, entrance, and, the, public, opening, of, some, small, rooms, at, the, far, eastern, end, of, the, building, acquired, as, part, of, the, swap, with, the, national, portrait, gallery, this, might, include, a, new, public, staircase, in, the, bow, on, the, eastern, fa, ade, no, timetable, has, been, announced, for, these, additional, projects, in, april, 2021, a, jury, short, listed, six, firms, of, architects, caruso, st, john, david, chipperfield, architects, asif, kahn, david, kohn, architects, selldorf, architects, and, witherford, watson, mann, architects, in, a, competition, for, design, proposals, to, upgrade, the, sainsbury, wing, a, letter, written, in, 1990, by, one, of, the, donors, john, sainsbury, was, discovered, in, 2023, during, the, demolition, of, two, false, columns, in, which, he, argued, that, the, false, columns, are, a, mistake, of, the, architect, and, that, we, would, live, to, regret, our, accepting, this, detail, of, his, design, in, 2024, excavations, for, the, sainsbury, wing, extension, at, jubilee, walk, uncovered, evidence, that, the, anglo, saxon, settlement, of, lundenwic, extended,

1961, an, unemployed, bus, driver, kempton, bunton, stole, goya, s, portrait, of, the, duke, of, wellington, in, what, remains, the, only, successful, theft, from, the, gallery, four, years, later, bunton, returned, the, painting, voluntarily, following, a, high, profile, trial, he, was, found, not, guilty, of, stealing, the, painting, but, guilty, of, stealing, the, frame, in, july, 1987, a,
