plucked, the, clarinet, is, a, single, reed, musical, instrument, in, the, woodwind, family, with, a, nearly, cylindrical, bore, and, a, flared, bell, clarinets, comprise, a, family, of, instruments, of, differing, sizes, and, pitches, the, clarinet, family, is, the, largest, woodwind, family, ranging, from, the, bb, contrabass, to, the, e, soprano, the, b, soprano, clarinet, is, the, most, common, type, and, is, the, instrument, usually, indicated, by, the, word, clarinet, german, instrument, maker, johann, christoph, denner, is, generally, credited, with, inventing, the, clarinet, sometime, around, 1700, by, adding, a, register, key, to, the, chalumeau, an, earlier, single, reed, instrument, over, time, additional, keywork, and, airtight, pads, were, added, to, improve, the, tone, and, playability, today, the, clarinet, is, a, standard, fixture, of, the, orchestra, and, concert, band, and, is, used, in, classical, music, military, bands, klezmer, jazz, and, other, styles, the, word, clarinet, may, have, entered, the, english, language, via, the, french, clarinette, the, feminine, diminutive, of, old, french, clarin, or, from, proven, al, clarin, oboe, originating, from, the, latin, root, clarus, clear, the, word, is, related, to, middle, english, clarion, a, type, of, trumpet, the, name, of, which, derives, from, the, same, root, the, earliest, mention, of, the, word, clarinette, being, used, for, the, instrument, dates, to, a, 1710, order, placed, by, the, duke, of, gronsfeld, for, two, instruments, made, by, jacob, denner, the, english, form, clarinet, is, found, as, early, as, 1733, and, the, now, archaic, clarionet, appears, from, 1784, until, the, early, 20th, century, a, person, who, plays, the, clarinet, is, called, a, clarinetist, in, north, american, english, a, clarinettist, in, british, english, or, simply, a, clarinet, player, the, clarinet, s, cylindrical, bore, is, the, main, reason, for, its, distinctive, timbre, which, varies, between, the, three, main, registers, the, chalumeau, clarion, and, altissimo, the, a, and, b, clarinets, have, nearly, the, same, bore, and, nearly, identical, tonal, quality, although, the, a, typically, has, a, slightly, warmer, sound, the, tone, of, the, e, clarinet, is, brighter, and, can, be, heard, through, loud, orchestral, textures, the, bass, clarinet, has, a, characteristically, deep, mellow, sound, and, the, alto, clarinet, sounds, similar, to, the, bass, though, not, as, dark, clarinets, have, the, largest, pitch, range, of, common, woodwinds, nearly, all, soprano, and, piccolo, clarinets, have, keywork, enabling, them, to, play, the, e, below, middle, c, as, their, lowest, written, note, the, concert, pitch, that, sounds, depends, on, the, individual, instrument, s, transposition, this, low, e, sounds, as, a, concert, d, 3, on, a, b, soprano, clarinet, a, whole, tone, lower, than, the, written, note, some, b, clarinets, go, to, a, written, e, 3, to, match, the, range, of, the, a, clarinet, bass, clarinets, have, keywork, extending, the, low, range, to, a, written, e, and, some, have, additional, keys, to, enable, a, written, c, 3, among, the, less, common, members, of, the, clarinet, family, contrabass, clarinets, may, have, keywork, to, written, d, 3, c, 3, or, b, 2, the, basset, clarinet, and, basset, horn, generally, go, to, low, c, 3, defining, the, top, end, of, a, clarinet, s, range, is, difficult, since, many, advanced, players, can, produce, notes, well, above, the, highest, notes, commonly, found, in, method, books, g, 6, is, usually, the, highest, note, encountered, in, classical, repertoire, but, fingerings, as, high, as, a, 7, exist, the, range, of, a, clarinet, can, be, divided, into, three, distinct, registers, the, three, registers, have, characteristically, different, sounds, the, chalumeau, is, rich, and, dark, the, clarion, is, brighter, and, sweet, like, a, trumpet, heard, from, afar, and, the, altissimo, can, be, piercing, and, sometimes, shrill, the, production, of, sound, by, a, clarinet, follows, these, steps, in, addition, to, this, primary, compression, wave, other, waves, known, as, harmonics, are, created, harmonics, are, caused, by, factors, including, the, imperfect, wobbling, and, shaking, of, the, reed, the, reed, sealing, the, mouthpiece, opening, for, part, of, the, wave, cycle, which, creates, a, flattened, section, of, the, sound, wave, and, imperfections, bumps, and, holes, in, the, bore, a, wide, variety, of, compression, waves, are, created, but, only, some, primarily, the, odd, harmonics, are, reinforced, this, in, combination, with, the, cut, off, frequency, where, a, significant, drop, in, resonance, occurs, results, in, the, characteristic, tone, of, the, clarinet, the, bore, is, cylindrical, for, most, of, the, tube, with, an, inner, bore, diameter, between, 0, 575, and, 0, 585, inches, 14, 6, and, 14, 9, mm, but, there, is, a, subtle, hourglass, shape, with, the, thinnest, part, below, the, junction, between, the, upper, and, lower, joint, this, hourglass, shape, although, invisible, to, the, naked, eye, helps, to, correct, the, pitch, and, responsiveness, of, the, instrument, the, diameter, of, the, bore, affects, the, instrument, s, sound, characteristics, the, bell, at, the, bottom, of, the, clarinet, flares, out, to, improve, the, tone, and, tuning, of, the, lowest, notes, the, fixed, reed, and, fairly, uniform, diameter, of, the, clarinet, result, in, an, acoustical, performance, approximating, that, of, a, cylindrical, stopped, pipe, recorders, use, a, tapered, internal, bore, to, overblow, at, the, octave, when, the, thumb, register, hole, is, pinched, open, while, the, clarinet, with, its, cylindrical, bore, overblows, at, the, twelfth, most, modern, clarinets, have, undercut, tone, holes, that, improve, intonation, and, sound, undercutting, means, chamfering, the, bottom, edge, of, tone, holes, inside, the, bore, acoustically, this, makes, the, tone, hole, function, as, if, it, were, larger, but, its, main, function, is, to, allow, the, air, column, to, follow, the, curve, up, through, the, tone, hole, surface, tension, instead, of, blowing, past, it, under, the, increasingly, directional, frequencies, of, the, upper, registers, covering, or, uncovering, the, tone, holes, varies, the, length, of, the, pipe, changing, the, resonant, frequencies, of, the, enclosed, air, column, and, hence, the, pitch, the, player, moves, between, the, chalumeau, and, clarion, registers, through, use, of, the, register, key, the, open, register, key, stops, the, fundamental, frequency, from, being, reinforced, making, the, reed, vibrate, at, three, times, the, frequency, which, produces, a, note, a, twelfth, above, the, original, note, most, woodwind, instruments, have, a, second, register, that, begins, an, octave, above, the, first, with, notes, at, twice, the, frequency, of, the, lower, notes, with, the, aid, of, an, octave, or, register, key, the, notes, sound, an, octave, higher, as, the, fingering, pattern, repeats, these, instruments, are, said, to, overblow, at, the, octave, the, clarinet, differs, since, it, acts, as, a, closed, pipe, system, the, low, chalumeau, register, plays, fundamentals, but, the, clarion, second, register, plays, the, third, harmonics, a, perfect, twelfth, higher, than, the, fundamentals, the, clarinet, is, therefore, said, to, overblow, at, the, twelfth, the, first, several, notes, of, the, altissimo, third, range, aided, by, the, register, key, and, venting, with, the, first, left, hand, hole, play, the, fifth, harmonics, a, perfect, twelfth, plus, a, major, sixth, above, the, fundamentals, the, fifth, and, seventh, harmonics, are, also, available, sounding, a, further, sixth, and, fourth, a, flat, diminished, fifth, higher, respectively, these, are, the, notes, of, the, altissimo, register, the, lip, position, and, pressure, shaping, of, the, vocal, tract, choice, of, reed, and, mouthpiece, amount, of, air, pressure, created, and, evenness, of, the, airflow, account, for, most, of, the, player, s, ability, to, control, the, tone, of, a, clarinet, their, vocal, tract, will, be, shaped, to, resonate, at, frequencies, associated, with, the, tone, being, produced, vibrato, a, pulsating, change, of, pitch, is, rare, in, classical, literature, however, certain, performers, such, as, richard, stoltzman, use, vibrato, in, classical, music, special, fingerings, and, lip, bending, may, be, used, to, play, microtonal, intervals, there, have, also, been, efforts, to, create, a, quarter, tone, clarinet, clarinet, bodies, have, been, made, from, a, variety, of, materials, including, wood, plastic, hard, rubber, or, ebonite, metal, and, ivory, the, vast, majority, of, wooden, clarinets, are, made, from, african, blackwood, grenadilla, or, more, uncommonly, honduran, rosewood, or, cocobolo, historically, other, woods, particularly, boxwood, and, ebony, were, used, since, the, mid, 20th, century, clarinets, particularly, student, or, band, models, are, also, made, from, plastics, such, as, acrylonitrile, butadiene, styrene, abs, one, of, the, first, such, blends, of, plastic, was, resonite, a, term, originally, trademarked, by, selmer, the, greenline, model, by, buffet, crampon, is, made, from, a, composite, of, resin, and, the, african, blackwood, powder, left, over, from, the, manufacture, of, wooden, clarinets, metal, soprano, clarinets, were, popular, in, the, late, 19th, century, particularly, for, military, use, metal, is, still, used, for, the, bodies, of, some, contra, alto, and, contrabass, clarinets, and, the, necks, and, bells, of, nearly, all, alto, and, larger, clarinets, mouthpieces, are, generally, made, of, hard, rubber, although, some, inexpensive, mouthpieces, may, be, made, of, plastic, other, materials, such, as, glass, wood, ivory, and, metal, have, also, been, used, ligatures, are, often, made, of, metal, and, tightened, using, one, or, more, adjustment, screws, other, materials, include, plastic, string, or, fabric, the, clarinet, uses, a, single, reed, made, from, the, cane, of, arundo, donax, reeds, may, also, be, manufactured, from, synthetic, materials, the, ligature, fastens, the, reed, to, the, mouthpiece, when, air, is, blown, through, the, opening, between, the, reed, and, the, mouthpiece, facing, the, reed, vibrates, and, produces, the, clarinet, s, sound, most, players, buy, manufactured, reeds, although, many, make, adjustments, to, these, reeds, and, some, make, their, own, reeds, from, cane, blanks, reeds, come, in, varying, degrees, of, hardness, generally, indicated, on, a, scale, from, one, soft, through, five, hard, this, numbering, system, is, not, standardized, reeds, with, the, same, number, often, vary, in, hardness, across, manufacturers, and, models, reed, and, mouthpiece, characteristics, work, together, to, determine, ease, of, playability, and, tonal, characteristics, the, reed, is, attached, to, the, mouthpiece, by, the, ligature, and, the, top, half, inch, or, so, of, this, assembly, is, held, in, the, player, s, mouth, in, the, past, string, was, used, to, bind, the, reed, to, the, mouthpiece, the, formation, of, the, mouth, around, the, mouthpiece, and, reed, is, called, the, embouchure, the, reed, is, on, the, underside, of, the, mouthpiece, pressing, against, the, player, s, lower, lip, while, the, top, teeth, normally, contact, the, top, of, the, mouthpiece, some, players, roll, the, upper, lip, under, the, top, teeth, to, form, what, is, called, a, double, lip, embouchure, adjustments, in, the, strength, and, shape, of, the, embouchure, change, the, tone, and, intonation, players, sometimes, relieve, the, pressure, on, the, upper, teeth, and, inner, lower, lip, by, attaching, a, pad, to, the, top, of, the, mouthpiece, or, putting, temporary, cushioning, on, the, lower, teeth, the, mouthpiece, attaches, to, the, barrel, tuning, can, be, adjusted, by, using, barrels, of, varying, lengths, or, by, pulling, out, the, barrel, to, increase, the, instrument, s, length, on, basset, horns, and, lower, clarinets, there, is, a, curved, metal, neck, instead, of, a, barrel, the, main, body, of, most, clarinets, has, an, upper, joint, whose, mechanism, is, mostly, operated, by, the, left, hand, and, a, lower, joint, mostly, operated, by, the, right, hand, some, clarinets, have, a, one, piece, body, the, modern, soprano, clarinet, has, numerous, tone, holes, seven, are, covered, with, the, fingertips, and, the, rest, are, operated, using, a, set, of, 17, keys, the, most, common, system, of, keys, was, named, the, boehm, system, by, its, designer, hyacinthe, klos, after, flute, designer, theobald, boehm, but, it, is, not, the, same, as, the, boehm, system, used, on, flutes, the, other, main, key, system, is, the, oehler, system, which, is, used, mostly, in, germany, and, austria, the, related, albert, system, is, used, by, some, jazz, klezmer, and, eastern, european, folk, musicians, the, albert, and, oehler, systems, are, both, based, on, the, early, mueller, system, the, cluster, of, keys, at, the, bottom, of, the, upper, joint, protruding, slightly, beyond, the, cork, of, the, joint, are, known, as, the, trill, keys, and, are, operated, by, the, right, hand, the, entire, weight, of, the, smaller, clarinets, is, supported, by, the, right, thumb, behind, the, lower, joint, on, what, is, called, the, thumb, rest, larger, clarinets, are, supported, with, a, neck, strap, or, a, floor, peg, below, the, main, body, is, a, flared, end, known, as, the, bell, the, bell, does, not, amplify, the, sound, but, improves, the, uniformity, of, the, instrument, s, tone, for, the, lowest, notes, in, each, register, for, the, other, notes, the, sound, is, produced, almost, entirely, at, the, tone, holes, and, the, bell, is, irrelevant, on, basset, horns, and, larger, clarinets, the, bell, curves, up, and, forward, and, is, usually, made, of, metal, the, clarinet, has, its, roots, in, early, single, reed, instruments, used, in, ancient, greece, and, ancient, egypt, the, modern, clarinet, developed, from, a, baroque, instrument, called, the, chalumeau, this, instrument, was, similar, to, a, recorder, but, with, a, single, reed, mouthpiece, and, a, cylindrical, bore, lacking, a, register, key, it, was, played, mainly, in, its, fundamental, register, with, a, limited, range, of, about, one, and, a, half, octaves, it, had, eight, finger, holes, like, a, recorder, and, a, written, pitch, range, from, f, 3, to, g, 4, at, this, time, contrary, to, modern, practice, the, reed, was, placed, in, contact, with, the, upper, lip, around, the, beginning, of, the, 18th, century, the, german, instrument, maker, johann, christoph, denner, or, possibly, his, son, jacob, denner, equipped, a, chalumeau, in, the, alto, register, with, two, keys, one, of, which, enabled, access, to, a, higher, register, this, second, register, did, not, begin, an, octave, above, the, first, as, with, other, woodwind, instruments, but, started, an, octave, and, a, perfect, fifth, higher, than, the, first, a, second, key, at, the, top, extended, the, range, of, the, first, register, to, a, 4, and, together, with, the, register, key, to, b, 4, later, denner, lengthened, the, bell, and, provided, it, with, a, third, key, to, extend, the, pitch, range, down, to, e, 3, after, denner, s, innovations, other, makers, added, keys, to, improve, tuning, and, facilitate, fingerings, and, the, chalumeau, fell, into, disuse, the, clarinet, of, the, classical, period, as, used, by, mozart, typically, had, five, keys, mozart, suggested, extending, the, clarinet, downwards, by, four, semitones, to, c, 3, which, resulted, in, the, basset, clarinet, that, was, about, 18, centimetres, 7, 1, in, longer, made, first, by, theodor, lotz, in, 1791, mozart, composed, the, concerto, for, clarinet, and, orchestra, in, a, major, for, this, instrument, with, passages, ranging, down, to, c, 3, by, the, time, of, beethoven, c, 1780, 1820, the, clarinet, was, a, fixed, member, in, the, orchestra, the, number, of, keys, was, limited, because, their, felt, pads, did, not, seal, tightly, baltic, german, clarinetist, and, master, clarinet, maker, iwan, m, ller, remedied, this, by, countersinking, the, tone, holes, for, the, keys, and, covering, the, pads, with, soft, leather, these, leather, pads, sealed, the, holes, better, than, felt, making, it, possible, to, equip, the, instrument, with, considerably, more, keys, in, 1812, m, ller, presented, a, clarinet, with, seven, finger, holes, and, thirteen, keys, which, he, called, clarinet, omnitonic, since, it, was, capable, of, playing, in, all, keys, it, was, no, longer, necessary, to, use, differently, tuned, clarinets, for, a, different, keys, m, ller, is, also, considered, the, inventor, of, the, metal, ligature, and, the, thumb, rest, during, this, period, the, typical, embouchure, also, changed, orienting, the, mouthpiece, with, the, reed, facing, downward, this, was, first, recommended, in, 1782, and, became, standard, by, the, 1830s, in, the, late, 1830s, german, flute, maker, theobald, b, hm, invented, a, ring, and, axle, key, system, for, the, flute, this, key, system, was, first, used, on, the, clarinet, between, 1839, and, 1843, by, french, clarinetist, hyacinthe, klos, in, collaboration, with, instrument, maker, louis, auguste, buffet, their, design, introduced, needle, springs, for, the, axles, and, the, ring, keys, simplified, some, complicated, fingering, patterns, the, inventors, called, this, the, boehm, clarinet, although, b, hm, was, not, involved, in, its, development, and, the, system, differed, from, the, one, used, on, the, flute, other, key, systems, have, been, developed, many, built, around, modifications, to, the, basic, boehm, system, including, the, full, boehm, mazzeo, mcintyre, the, benade, nx, and, the, reform, boehm, system, which, combined, boehm, system, keywork, with, a, german, mouthpiece, and, bore, the, albert, clarinet, was, developed, by, eug, ne, albert, in, 1848, this, model, was, based, on, the, m, ller, clarinet, with, some, changes, to, keywork, and, was, also, known, as, the, simple, system, it, included, a, spectacle, key, patented, by, adolphe, sax, and, rollers, to, improve, little, finger, movement, after, 1861, a, patent, c, sharp, key, developed, by, joseph, tyler, was, added, to, other, clarinet, models, improved, versions, of, albert, clarinets, were, built, in, belgium, and, france, for, export, to, the, uk, and, the, us, around, 1860, clarinettist, carl, baermann, and, instrument, maker, georg, ottensteiner, developed, the, patented, baermann, ottensteiner, clarinet, this, instrument, had, new, connecting, levers, allowing, multiple, fingering, options, to, operate, some, of, the, pads, the, brahms, clarinetist, richard, m, hlfeld, used, this, clarinet, and, the, american, clarinet, soloist, charles, neidich, has, used, a, baermann, ottensteiner, instrument, for, playing, compositions, by, brahms, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, german, clarinetist, and, clarinet, maker, oskar, oehler, presented, a, clarinet, using, similar, fingerings, to, the, baermann, instrument, with, significantly, more, toneholes, than, the, b, hm, model, the, new, clarinet, was, called, the, oehler, system, clarinet, or, german, clarinet, while, the, b, hm, clarinet, has, since, been, called, the, french, clarinet, the, french, clarinet, differs, from, the, german, not, only, in, fingering, but, also, in, sound, richard, strauss, noted, that, french, clarinets, have, a, flat, nasal, tone, while, german, ones, approximate, the, singing, voice, among, modern, instruments, the, difference, is, smaller, although, intonation, differences, persist, the, use, of, oehler, clarinets, has, continued, in, german, and, austrian, orchestras, today, the, boehm, system, is, standard, everywhere, except, in, germany, and, austria, where, the, oehler, clarinet, is, still, used, some, contemporary, dixieland, players, continue, to, use, albert, system, clarinets, the, reform, boehm, system, is, also, popular, in, the, netherlands, the, modern, orchestral, standard, of, using, soprano, clarinets, in, b, and, a, has, to, do, partly, with, the, history, of, the, instrument, and, partly, with, acoustics, aesthetics, and, economics, before, about, 1800, due, to, the, lack, of, airtight, pads, practical, woodwinds, could, have, only, a, few, keys, to, control, accidentals, notes, outside, their, diatonic, home, scales, the, low, chalumeau, register, of, the, clarinet, spans, a, twelfth, an, octave, plus, a, perfect, fifth, before, overblowing, so, the, clarinet, needs, keys, holes, to, produce, all, nineteen, notes, in, this, range, this, involves, more, keywork, than, on, instruments, that, overblow, at, the, octave, oboes, flutes, bassoons, and, saxophones, need, only, twelve, notes, before, overblowing, since, clarinets, with, few, keys, cannot, play, chromatically, they, are, limited, to, playing, in, closely, related, keys, for, example, an, eighteenth, century, clarinet, in, c, could, play, music, in, f, c, and, g, and, their, relative, minors, with, good, intonation, but, with, progressive, difficulty, and, poorer, intonation, as, the, key, moved, away, from, this, range, with, the, advent, of, airtight, pads, and, improved, key, technology, more, keys, were, added, to, woodwinds, and, the, need, for, clarinets, in, multiple, keys, was, reduced, the, use, of, instruments, in, c, b, and, a, persisted, with, each, used, as, specified, by, the, composer, the, lower, pitched, clarinets, sound, mellower, less, bright, and, the, c, clarinet, the, highest, and, brightest, sounding, of, these, three, fell, out, of, favor, as, the, other, two, could, cover, its, range, and, their, sound, was, considered, better, while, the, clarinet, in, c, began, to, fall, out, of, general, use, around, 1850, some, composers, continued, to, write, c, parts, e, g, bizet, s, symphony, in, c, 1855, tchaikovsky, s, symphony, no, 2, 1872, smetana, s, overture, to, the, bartered, bride, 1866, and, m, vlast, 1874, dvo, k, s, slavonic, dance, op, 46, no, 1, 1878, brahms, symphony, no, 4, 1885, mahler, s, symphony, no, 6, 1906, and, strauss, der, rosenkavalier, 1911, while, technical, improvements, and, an, equal, tempered, scale, reduced, the, need, for, two, clarinets, the, technical, difficulty, of, playing, in, remote, keys, persisted, and, the, a, has, remained, a, standard, orchestral, instrument, by, the, late, 19th, century, the, orchestral, clarinet, repertoire, contained, so, much, music, for, clarinet, in, a, that, it, has, remained, in, use, the, orchestra, frequently, includes, two, clarinetists, each, usually, equipped, with, a, b, and, an, a, clarinet, and, clarinet, parts, commonly, alternate, between, the, instruments, in, the, 20th, century, igor, stravinsky, richard, strauss, and, gustav, mahler, employed, many, different, clarinets, including, the, e, or, d, soprano, clarinets, basset, horn, bass, clarinet, and, or, contrabass, clarinet, the, practice, of, using, different, clarinets, to, achieve, tonal, variety, was, common, in, 20th, century, classical, music, the, e, clarinet, b, clarinet, alto, clarinet, bass, clarinet, and, contra, alto, contrabass, clarinet, are, commonly, used, in, concert, bands, which, generally, have, multiple, b, clarinets, there, are, commonly, three, or, even, four, b, clarinet, parts, with, two, to, three, players, per, part, the, clarinet, is, widely, used, as, a, solo, instrument, the, clarinet, evolved, later, than, other, orchestral, woodwind, instruments, leaving, solo, repertoire, from, the, classical, period, onward, but, few, works, from, the, baroque, era, many, clarinet, concertos, and, clarinet, sonatas, have, been, written, to, showcase, the, instrument, for, example, those, by, mozart, and, weber, many, works, of, chamber, music, have, been, written, for, the, clarinet, common, combinations, are, groups, of, clarinets, playing, together, have, become, increasingly, popular, among, clarinet, enthusiasts, in, recent, years, common, forms, are, the, clarinet, was, a, central, instrument, in, jazz, beginning, with, early, jazz, players, in, the, 1910s, it, remained, a, signature, instrument, of, the, genre, through, much, of, the, big, band, era, into, the, 1940s, american, players, alphonse, picou, larry, shields, jimmie, noone, johnny, dodds, and, sidney, bechet, were, all, prominent, early, jazz, clarinet, players, swing, performers, such, as, benny, goodman, and, artie, shaw, rose, to, prominence, in, the, late, 1930s, beginning, in, the, 1940s, the, clarinet, faded, from, its, prominent, position, in, jazz, by, that, time, an, interest, in, dixieland, a, revival, of, traditional, new, orleans, jazz, had, begun, pete, fountain, was,
