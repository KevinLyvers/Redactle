stature, as, a, scholarly, work, helped, recruit, eminent, contributors, and, the, 9th, 1875, 1889, and, 11th, editions, 1911, are, landmark, encyclopaedias, for, scholarship, and, literary, style, starting, with, the, 11th, edition, and, following, its, acquisition, by, an, american, firm, the, britannica, shortened, and, simplified, articles, to, broaden, its, appeal, to, the, north, american, market, in, 1933, the, britannica, became, the, first, encyclopaedia, to, adopt, continuous, revision, in, which, the, encyclopaedia, is, continually, reprinted, with, every, article, updated, on, a, schedule, in, the, 21st, century, the, britannica, suffered, first, from, competition, with, the, digital, multimedia, encyclopaedia, microsoft, encarta, and, later, with, the, online, peer, produced, encyclopaedia, wikipedia, in, march, 2012, it, announced, it, would, no, longer, publish, printed, editions, and, would, focus, instead, on, the, online, version, britannica, has, been, assessed, as, being, more, politically, centrist, compared, to, wikipedia, which, is, considered, to, have, a, more, left, leaning, orientation, the, 15th, edition, 1974, 2010, has, a, three, part, structure, a, 12, volume, microp, dia, of, short, articles, generally, fewer, than, 750, words, a, 17, volume, macrop, dia, of, long, articles, two, to, 310, pages, and, a, single, prop, dia, volume, to, give, a, hierarchical, outline, of, knowledge, the, microp, dia, was, meant, for, quick, fact, checking, and, as, a, guide, to, the, macrop, dia, readers, are, advised, to, study, the, prop, dia, outline, to, understand, a, subject, s, context, and, to, find, more, detailed, articles, over, 70, years, the, size, of, the, britannica, has, remained, steady, with, about, 40, million, words, on, half, a, million, topics, though, published, in, the, united, states, since, 1901, the, britannica, has, for, the, most, part, maintained, british, english, spelling, from, 1985, the, britannica, consisted, of, four, parts, the, microp, dia, the, macrop, dia, the, prop, dia, and, a, two, volume, index, the, britannica, s, articles, are, contained, in, the, micro, and, macrop, dia, which, encompass, 12, and, 17, volumes, respectively, each, volume, having, roughly, one, thousand, pages, the, 2007, macrop, dia, has, 699, in, depth, articles, ranging, in, length, from, two, pages, to, 310, pages, with, references, and, named, contributors, in, contrast, the, 2007, microp, dia, has, roughly, 65, 000, articles, the, vast, majority, about, 97, of, which, contain, fewer, than, 750, words, no, references, and, no, named, contributors, the, microp, dia, articles, are, intended, for, quick, fact, checking, and, to, help, in, finding, more, thorough, information, in, the, macrop, dia, the, macrop, dia, articles, are, meant, as, authoritative, well, written, commentaries, on, their, subjects, as, well, as, storehouses, of, information, not, covered, elsewhere, the, longest, article, 310, pages, is, on, the, subject, of, the, united, states, and, it, resulted, from, merging, separate, articles, on, the, individual, us, states, a, 2013, global, edition, of, britannica, contained, approximately, 40, 000, articles, information, can, be, found, in, the, britannica, by, following, the, cross, references, in, the, microp, dia, and, macrop, dia, these, are, sparse, however, averaging, one, cross, reference, per, page, readers, are, instead, recommended, to, consult, the, alphabetical, index, or, the, prop, dia, which, organizes, the, britannica, s, contents, by, topic, the, core, of, the, prop, dia, is, its, outline, of, knowledge, which, aims, to, provide, a, logical, framework, for, all, human, knowledge, accordingly, the, outline, is, consulted, by, the, britannica, s, editors, to, decide, which, articles, should, be, included, in, the, micro, and, macrop, dia, the, outline, can, also, be, used, as, a, study, guide, as, it, puts, subjects, in, their, proper, perspective, and, suggests, a, series, of, britannica, articles, for, the, student, wishing, to, learn, a, topic, in, depth, however, libraries, have, found, that, it, is, scarcely, used, for, this, purpose, and, reviewers, have, recommended, that, it, be, dropped, from, the, encyclopaedia, the, prop, dia, contains, color, transparencies, of, human, anatomy, and, several, appendices, listing, the, staff, members, advisors, and, contributors, to, all, three, parts, of, the, britannica, taken, together, the, microp, dia, and, macrop, dia, comprise, roughly, 40, million, words, and, 24, 000, images, the, two, volume, index, has, 2, 350, pages, listing, the, 228, 274, topics, covered, in, the, britannica, together, with, 474, 675, subentries, under, those, topics, the, britannica, generally, prefers, british, spelling, over, american, for, example, it, uses, colour, not, color, centre, not, center, and, encyclopaedia, not, encyclopedia, there, are, some, exceptions, to, this, rule, such, as, defense, rather, than, defence, common, alternative, spellings, are, provided, with, cross, references, such, as, color, see, colour, since, 1936, the, britannica, has, been, revised, on, a, regular, schedule, with, at, least, 10, of, the, articles, considered, for, revision, each, year, according, to, one, britannica, website, 46, of, the, articles, in, the, 2007, edition, were, revised, over, the, preceding, three, years, however, according, to, another, britannica, website, only, 35, of, the, articles, were, revised, over, the, same, period, the, alphabetization, of, articles, in, the, microp, dia, and, macrop, dia, follows, strict, rules, diacritical, marks, and, non, english, letters, are, ignored, while, numerical, entries, such, as, 1812, war, of, are, alphabetized, as, if, the, number, had, been, written, out, eighteen, twelve, war, of, articles, with, identical, names, are, ordered, first, by, persons, then, by, places, then, by, things, rulers, with, identical, names, are, organized, first, alphabetically, by, country, and, then, by, chronology, thus, charles, iii, of, france, precedes, charles, i, of, england, listed, in, britannica, as, the, ruler, of, great, britain, and, ireland, that, is, they, are, alphabetized, as, if, their, titles, were, charles, france, 3, and, charles, great, britain, and, ireland, 1, similarly, places, that, share, names, are, organized, alphabetically, by, country, then, by, ever, smaller, political, divisions, in, march, 2012, the, company, announced, that, the, 2010, edition, would, be, the,

educational, technology, and, supplemental, curriculum, krishnan, aimed, at, providing, more, useful, and, relevant, solutions, to, customer, needs, extending, and, renewing, britannica, s, historical, emphasis, on, utility, which, had, been, the, watchword, of, its, first, edition, in, 1768, as, the, britannica, is, a, general, encyclopaedia, it, does, not, seek, to, compete, with, specialized, encyclopaedias, such, as, the, encyclopaedia, of, mathematics, or, the, dictionary, of, the, middle, ages, which, can, devote, much, more, space, to, their, chosen, topics, in, its, first, years, the, britannica, s, main, competitor, was, the, general, encyclopaedia, of, ephraim, chambers, and, soon, thereafter, rees, s, cyclop, dia, and, coleridge, s, encyclop, dia, metropolitana, in, the, 20th, century, successful, competitors, included, collier, s, encyclopedia, the, encyclopedia, americana, and, the, world, book, encyclopedia, nevertheless, from, the, 9th, edition, onwards, the, britannica, was, widely, considered, to, have, the, greatest, authority, of, any, general, english, language, encyclopaedia, especially, because, of, its, broad, coverage, and, eminent, authors, the, print, version, of, the, britannica, was, significantly, more, expensive, than, its, competitors, since, the, early, 1990s, the, britannica, has, faced, new, challenges, from, digital, information, sources, the, internet, facilitated, by, the, development, of, search, engines, has, grown, into, a, common, source, of, information, for, many, people, and, provides, easy, access, to, reliable, original, sources, and, expert, opinions, thanks, in, part, to, initiatives, such, as, google, books, mit, s, release, of, its, educational, materials, and, the, open, pubmed, central, library, of, the, national, library, of, medicine, the, internet, tends, to, provide, more, current, coverage, than, print, media, due, to, the, ease, with, which, material, on, the, internet, can, be, updated, in, rapidly, changing, fields, such, as, science, technology, politics, culture, and, modern, history, the, britannica, has, struggled, to, stay, up, to, date, a, problem, first, analysed, systematically, by, its, former, editor, walter, yust, eventually, the, britannica, turned, to, focus, more, on, its, online, edition, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, has, been,

comparison, of, the, 1993, britannica, with, two, comparable, encyclopaedias, collier, s, encyclopedia, and, the, encyclopedia, americana, for, the, quantitative, analysis, ten, articles, were,

f, were, awarded, in, four, categories, coverage, accuracy, clarity, and, recency, in, all, four, categories, and, for, all, three, encyclopaedias, the, four, average, grades, fell, between, b, and, b, chiefly, because, none, of, the, encyclopaedias, had, an, article, on, sexual, harassment, in, 1994, in, the, accuracy, category, the, britannica, received, one, d, and, seven, a, s, encyclopedia, americana, received, eight, a, s, and, collier, s, received, one, d, and, seven, a, s, thus, britannica, received, an, average, score, of, 92, for, accuracy, to, americana, s, 95, and, collier, s, 92, in, the, timeliness, category, britannica, averaged, an, 86, to, americana, s, 90, and, collier, s, 85, in, 2013, the, president, of, encyclop, dia, britannica, announced, that, after, 244, years, the, encyclopaedia, would, cease, print, production, and, all, future, editions, would, be, entirely, digital, the, most, notable, competitor, of, the, britannica, among, cd, dvd, rom, digital, encyclopaedias, was, encarta, now, discontinued, a, modern, multimedia, encyclopaedia, that, incorporated, three, print, encyclopaedias, funk, wagnalls, collier, s, and, the, new, merit, scholar, s, encyclopedia, encarta, was, the, top, selling, multimedia, encyclopaedia, based, on, total, us, retail, sales, from, january, 2000, to, february, 2006, both, occupied, the, same, price, range, with,

browser, interactive, maps, math, language, and, homework, tools, a, us, and, uk, dictionary, and, a, youth, edition, like, encarta, the, digital, britannica, has, been, criticized, for, being, biased, towards, united, states, audiences, the, united, kingdom, related, articles, are, updated, less, often, maps, of, the, united, states, are, more, detailed, than, those, of, other, countries, and, it, lacks, a, uk, dictionary, like, the, britannica, encarta, was, available, online, by, subscription, although, some, content, could, be, accessed, free, the, main, online, alternative, to, britannica, is, wikipedia, the, key, differences, between, the, two, lie, in, accessibility, the, model, of, participation, they, bring, to, an, encyclopedic, project, their, respective, style, sheets, and, editorial, policies, relative, ages, the, number, of, subjects, treated, the, number, of, languages, in, which, articles, are, written, and, made, available, and, their, underlying, economic, models, unlike, britannica, wikipedia, is, a, not, for, profit, does, not, carry, advertising, on, its, site, and, is, not, connected, with, traditional, profit, and, contract, based, publishing, distribution, networks, britannica, s, articles, either, have, known, authorship, or, a, set, of, possible, authors, the, editorial, staff, with, the, exception, of, the, editorial, staff, most, of, britannica, s, contributors, are, experts, in, their, field, some, are, nobel, laureates, by, contrast, the, articles, of, wikipedia, are, written, by, people, of, unknown, degrees, of, expertise, most, do, not, claim, any, particular, expertise, and, of, those, who, do, many, are, anonymous, and, have, no, verifiable, credentials, it, is, for, this, lack, of, institutional, vetting, or, certification, that, former, britannica, editor, in, chief, robert, mchenry, noted, his, belief, in, 2004, that, wikipedia, could, not, hope, to, rival, the, britannica, in, accuracy, in, 2005, the, journal, nature, chose, articles, from, both, websites, in, a, wide, range, of, science, topics, and, sent, them, to, what, it, called, relevant, field, experts, for, peer, review, the, experts, then, compared, the, competing, articles, one, from, each, site, on, a, given, topic, side, by, side, but, were, not, told, which, article, came, from, which, site, nature, got, back, 42, usable, reviews, the, journal, found, just, eight, serious, errors, such, as, general, misunderstandings, of, vital, concepts, four, from, each, site, it, also, discovered, many, factual, errors, omissions, or, misleading, statements, 162, in, wikipedia, and, 123, in, britannica, an, average, of, 3, 86, mistakes, per, article, for, wikipedia, and, 2, 92, for, britannica, although, britannica, was, revealed, as, the, more, accurate, encyclopaedia, with, fewer, errors, in, its, rebuttal, called, nature, s, study, flawed, and, misleading, and, called, for, a, prompt, retraction, it, noted, that, two, of, the, articles, in, the, study, were, taken, from, a, britannica, yearbook, and, not, the, encyclopaedia, and, another, two, were, from, compton, s, encyclopedia, called, the, britannica, student, encyclopedia, on, the, company, s, website, nature, defended, its, story, and, declined, to, retract, stating, that, as, it, was, comparing, wikipedia, with, the, web, version, of, britannica, it, used, whatever, relevant, material, was, available, on, britannica, s, website, interviewed, in, february, 2009, the, managing, director, of, britannica, uk, said, wikipedia, is, a, fun, site, to, use, and, has, a, lot, of, interesting, entries, on, there, but, their, approach, wouldn, t, work, for, encyclop, dia, britannica, my, job, is, to, create, more, awareness, of, our, very, different, approaches, to, publishing, in, the, public, mind, they, re, a, chisel, we, re, a, drill, and, you, need, to, have, the, correct, tool, for, the, job, for, the, 15th, anniversary, of, wikipedia, the, telegraph, published, two, opinion, pieces, which, compared, wikipedia, to, britannica, and, falsely, claimed, that, britannica, had, gone, bankrupt, in, 1996, in, a, january, 2016, press, release, britannica, responded, by, calling, wikipedia, an, impressive, achievement, but, argued, that, critics, should, avoid, false, comparisons, to, britannica, in, terms, of, differing, models, and, purposes, since, the, 3rd, edition, the, britannica, has, enjoyed, a, popular, and, critical, reputation, for, general, excellence, the, 3rd, and, 9th, editions, were, pirated, for, sale, in, the, united, states, beginning, with, dobson, s, encyclop, dia, on, the, release, of, the, 14th, edition, time, magazine, dubbed, the, britannica, the, patriarch, of, the, library, in, a, related, advertisement, naturalist, william, beebe, was, quoted, as, saying, that, the, britannica, was, beyond, comparison, because, there, is, no, competitor, references, to, the, britannica, can, be, found, throughout, english, literature, most, notably, in, one, of, sir, arthur, conan, doyle, s, favourite, sherlock, holmes, stories, the, red, headed, league, the, tale, was, highlighted, by, the, lord, mayor, of, london, gilbert, inglefield, at, the, bicentennial, of, the, britannica, the, britannica, has, a, reputation, for, summarizing, knowledge, to, further, their, education, some, people, have, devoted, themselves, to, reading, the, entire, britannica, taking, anywhere, from, three, to, 22, years, to, do, so, when, fat, h, ali, became, the, shah, of, persia, in, 1797, he, was, given, a, set, of, the, britannica, s, 3rd, edition, after, reading, the, complete, set, he, extended, his, royal, title, to, include, most, formidable, lord, and, master, of, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, writer, george, bernard, shaw, claimed, to, have, read, the, complete, 9th, edition, except, for, the, science, articles, richard, evelyn, byrd, took, the, britannica, as, reading, material, for, his, five, month, stay, at, the, south, pole, in, 1934, and, philip, beaver, read, it, during, a, sailing, expedition, more, recently, a, j, jacobs, an, editor, at, esquire, magazine, read, the, entire, 2002,

suite, received, the, 2004, distinguished, achievement, award, from, the, association, of, educational, publishers, on, 15, july, 2009, encyclop, dia, britannica, was, awarded, a, spot, as, one, of, top, ten, superbrands, in, the, uk, by, a, panel, of, more, than, 2, 000, independent, reviewers, as, reported, by, the, bbc, topics, are, chosen, in, part, by, reference, to, the, prop, dia, outline, of, knowledge, the, bulk, of, the, britannica, is, devoted, to, geography, 26, of, the, macrop, dia, biography, 14, biology, and, medicine, 11, literature, 7, physics, and, astronomy, 6, religion, 5, art, 4, western, philosophy, 4, and, law, 3, a, complementary, study, of, the, microp, dia, found, that, geography, accounted, for, 25, of, articles, science, 18, social, sciences, 17, biography, 17, and, all, other, humanities, 25, writing, in, 1992, one, reviewer, judged, that, the, range, depth, and, catholicity, of, coverage, are, unsurpassed, by, any, other, general, encyclopaedia, the, britannica, does, not, cover, topics, in, equal, detail, for, example, the, whole, of, buddhism, and, most, other, religions, is, covered, in, a, single, macrop, dia, article, whereas, 14, articles, are, devoted, to, christianity, comprising, nearly, half, of, all, religion, articles, the, britannica, covers, 50, 479, biographies, 5, 999, of, them, about, women, with, 11, 87, being, british, citizens, and, 25, 51, us, citizens, however, the, britannica, has, been, lauded, as, the, least, biased, of, general, encyclopaedias, marketed, to, western, readers, and, praised, for, its, biographies, of, important, women, of, all, eras, it, can, be, stated, without, fear, of, contradiction, that, the, 15th, edition, of, the, britannica, accords, non, western, cultural, social, and, scientific, developments, more, notice, than, any, general, english, language, encyclopedia, currently, on, the, market, on, rare, occasions, the, britannica, has, been, criticized, for, its, editorial, choices, given, its, roughly, constant, size, the, encyclopaedia, has, needed, to, reduce, or, eliminate, some, topics, to, accommodate, others, resulting, in, controversial, decisions, the, initial, 15th, edition, 1974, 1985, was, faulted, for, having, reduced, or, eliminated, coverage, of, children, s, literature, military, decorations, and, the, french, poet, joachim, du, bellay, editorial, mistakes, were, also, alleged, such, as, inconsistent, sorting, of, japanese, biographies, its, elimination, of, the, index, was, condemned, as, was, the, apparently, arbitrary, division, of, articles, into, the, microp, dia, and, macrop, dia, summing, up, one, critic, called, the, initial, 15th, edition, a, qualified, failure, cares, more, for, juggling, its, format, than, for, preserving, more, recently, reviewers, from, the, american, library, association, were, surprised, to, find, that, most, educational, articles, had, been, eliminated, from, the, 1992, macrop, dia, along, with, the, article, on, psychology, some, very, few, britannica, appointed, contributors, are, mistaken, a, notorious, instance, from, the, britannica, s, early, years, is, the, rejection, of, newtonian, gravity, by, george, gleig, the, chief, editor, of, the, 3rd, edition, 1788, 1797, who, wrote, that, gravity, was, caused, by, the, classical, element, of, fire, the, britannica, has, also, staunchly, defended, a, scientific, approach, to, cultural, topics, as, it, did, with, william, robertson, smith, s, articles, on, religion, in, the, 9th, edition, particularly, his, article, stating, that, the, bible, was, not, historically, accurate, 1875, the, britannica, has, received, criticism, particularly, as, editions, become, outdated, it, is, expensive, to, produce, a, completely, new, edition, of, the, britannica, and, its, editors, delay, for, as, long, as, fiscally, sensible, usually, about, 25, years, for, example, despite, continuous, revision, the, 14th, edition, became, outdated, after, 35, years, 1929, 1964, when, american, physicist, harvey, einbinder, detailed, its, failings, in, his, 1964, book, the, myth, of, the, britannica, the, encyclopaedia, was, provoked, to, produce, the, 15th, edition, which, required, 10, years, of, work, editors, have, struggled, at, times, to, keep, the, britannica, current, one, 1994, critic, writes, it, is, not, difficult, to, find, articles, that, are, out, of, date, or, in, need, of, revision, noting, that, the, longer, macrop, dia, articles, are, more, likely, to, be, outdated, than, the, shorter, microp, dia, articles, information, in, the, microp, dia, is, sometimes, inconsistent, with, the, corresponding, macrop, dia, article, s, mainly, because, of, the, failure, to, update, one, or, the, other, the, bibliographies, of, the, macrop, dia, articles, have, been, criticized, for, being, more, out, of, date, than, the, articles, themselves, in, 2005, a, 12, year, old, schoolboy, in, britain, found, several, inaccuracies, in, the, britannica, s, entries, on, poland, and, wildlife, in, eastern, europe, in, 2010, an, entry, about, the, irish, civil, war, which, incorrectly, described, it, as, having, been, fought, between, the, north, and, south, of, ireland, was, discussed, in, the, irish, press, following, a, decision, by, the, department, of, education, and, science, to, pay, for, online, access, writing, about, the, 3rd, edition, 1788, 1797, britannica, s, chief, editor, george, gleig, observed, that, perfection, seems, to, be, incompatible, with, the, nature, of, works, constructed, on, such, a, plan, and, embracing, such, a, variety, of, subjects, in, march, 2006, the, britannica, wrote, we, in, no, way, mean, to, imply, that, britannica, is, error, free, we, have, never, made, such, a, claim, however, the, britannica, sales, department, had, previously, made, a, well, known, claim, in, 1962, regarding, the, 14th, edition, that, t, is, truth, it, is, unquestionable, fact, the, sentiment, of, the, 2006, statement, was, also, reflected, in, the, introduction, to, the, first, edition, of, the, britannica, written, by, its, original, editor, william, smellie, with, regard, to, errors, in, general, whether, falling, under, the, denomination, of, mental, typographical, or, accidental, we, are, conscious, of, being, able, to, point, out, a, greater, number, than, any, critic, whatever, men, who, are, acquainted, with, the, innumerable, difficulties, attending, the, execution, of, a, work, of, such, an, extensive, nature, will, make, proper, allowances, to, these, we, appeal, and, shall, rest, satisfied, with, the, judgment, they, pronounce, past, owners, have, included, in, chronological, order, the, edinburgh, scotland, based, printers,

printings, of, each, were, entirely, different, from, early, ones, throughout, history, the, britannica, has, had, two, aims, to, be, an, excellent, reference, book, and, to, provide, educational, material, in, 1974, the, 15th, edition, adopted, a, third, goal, to, systematize, all, human, knowledge, the, history, of, the, britannica, can, be, divided, into, five, eras, punctuated, by, changes, in, management, or, reorganization, of, the, dictionary, in, the, first, era, 1st, 6th, editions, 1768, 1826, the, britannica, was, managed, and, published, by, its, founders, colin, macfarquhar, and,

enterprise, and, it, is, one, of, the, most, enduring, legacies, of, the, scottish, enlightenment, in, this, era, the, britannica, moved, from, being, a, three, volume, set, 1st, edition, compiled, by, one, young, editor, william, smellie, to, a, 20, volume, set, written, by, numerous, authorities, several, other, encyclopaedias, competed, throughout, this, period, among, them, editions, of,

napier, others, were, attracted, by, the, britannica, s, reputation, the, contributors, often, came, from, other, countries, and, included, the, world, s, most, respected, authorities, in, their, fields, a, general, index, of, all, articles, was, included, for, the, first, time, in, the, 7th, edition, a, practice, maintained, until, 1974, production, of, the, 9th, edition, was, overseen, by, thomas, spencer, baynes, the, first, english, born, editor, in, chief, dubbed, the, scholar, s, edition, the, 9th, edition, is, the, most, scholarly, of, all, britannicas, after, 1880, baynes, was,

close, of, the, 19th, century, the, 9th, edition, was, outdated, and, the, britannica, faced, financial, difficulties, in, the, third, era, 10th, 14th, editions, 1901, 1973, the, britannica, was, managed, by, american, businessmen, who, introduced, direct, marketing, and, door, to, door, sales, the, american, owners, gradually, simplified, articles, making, them, less, scholarly, for, a, mass, market, the, 10th, edition, was, an, eleven, volume, supplement, including, one, each, of, maps, and, an, index, to, the, 9th, numbered, as, volumes, 25, 35, but, the, 11th, edition, was, a,

1936, he, began, the, policy, of, continuous, revision, this, was, a, departure, from, earlier, practice, in, which, the, articles, were, not, changed, until, a, new, edition, was, produced, at, roughly, 25, year, intervals, some, articles, unchanged, from, earlier, editions, powell, developed, new, educational, products, that, built, upon, the, britannica, s, reputation, in, 1943, sears,

of, editorial, planning, for, the, 15th, edition, of, britannica, from, 1965, the, britannica, sought, not, only, to, be, a, good, reference, work, and, educational, tool, but, to, systematize, all, human, knowledge, the, absence, of, a, separate, index, and, the, grouping, of, articles, into, parallel, encyclopaedias, the, micro, and, macrop, dia, provoked, a, firestorm, of, criticism, of, the,
