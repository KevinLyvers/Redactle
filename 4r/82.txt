that, it, represents, 1450a12, he, understands, character, not, to, denote, a, fictional, person, but, the, quality, of, the, person, acting, in, the, story, and, reacting, to, its, situations, 1450a5, he, defines, character, as, that, which, reveals, decision, of, whatever, sort, 1450b8, it, is, possible, therefore, to, have, stories, that, do, not, contain, characters, in, aristotle, s, sense, of, the, word, since, character, necessarily, involves, making, the, ethical, dispositions, of, those, performing, the, action, clear, if, in, speeches, the, speaker, decides, or, avoids, nothing, at, all, then, those, speeches, do, not, have, character, 1450b9, 11, aristotle, argues, for, the, primacy, of, plot, mythos, over, character, ethos, he, writes, but, the, most, important, of, these, is, the, structure, of, the, incidents, for, i, tragedy, is, a, representation, not, of, human, beings, but, of, action, and, life, happiness, and, unhappiness, lie, in, action, and, the, end, is, a, sort, of, action, not, a, quality, people, are, of, a, certain, sort, according, to, their, characters, but, happy, or, the, opposite, according, to, their, actions, so, do, not, act, in, order, to, represent, the, characters, but, they, include, the, characters, for, the, sake, of, their, actions, 1450a15, 23, aristotle, suggests, that, works, were, distinguished, in, the, first, instance, according, to, the, nature, of, the, person, who, created, them, the, grander, people, represented, fine, actions, i, e, those, of, fine, persons, by, producing, hymns, and, praise, poems, while, ordinary, people, represented, those, of, inferior, ones, by, composing, invectives, 1448b20, 1449a5, on, this, basis, a, distinction, between, the, individuals, represented, in, tragedy, and, in, comedy, arose, tragedy, along, with, epic, poetry, is, a, representation, of, serious, people, 1449b9, 10, while, comedy, is, a, representation, of, people, who, are, rather, inferior, 1449a32,
