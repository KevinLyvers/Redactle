during, his, final, years, in, macedonia, at, the, court, of, archelaus, i, of, macedon, it, premiered, posthumously, at, the, theatre, of, dionysus, in, 405, bc, as, part, of, a, tetralogy, that, also, included, iphigeneia, at, aulis, and, alcmaeon, in, corinth, and, which, euripides, son, or, nephew, is, assumed, to, have, directed, it, won, first, prize, in, the, city, dionysia, festival, competition, the, tragedy, is, based, on, the, greek, myth, of, king, pentheus, of, thebes, and, his, mother, agave, and, their, punishment, by, the, god, dionysus, who, is, pentheus, s, cousin, the, god, dionysus, appears, at, the, beginning, of, the, play, and, proclaims, that, he, has, arrived, in, thebes, to, avenge, the, slander, which, has, been, repeated, by, his, aunts, that, he, is, not, the, son, of, zeus, in, response, he, intends, to, introduce, dionysian, rites, into, the, city, and, he, intends, to, demonstrate, to, the, king, pentheus, and, to, thebes, that, he, was, indeed, born, a, god, at, the, end, of, the, play, pentheus, is, torn, apart, by, the, women, of, thebes, and, his, mother, agave, bears, his, head, on, a, thyrsus, to, her, father, cadmus, the, bacchae, is, considered, to, be, not, only, one, of, euripides, s, greatest, tragedies, but, also, one, of, the, greatest, ever, written, modern, or, ancient, the, bacchae, is, distinctive, in, that, the, chorus, is, integrated, into, the, plot, and, the, god, is, not, a, distant, presence, but, a, character, in, the, play, indeed, the, protagonist, the, bacchae, has, been, the, subject, of, widely, varying, interpretations, regarding, what, the, play, as, a, whole, means, or, even, indeed, whether, there, is, a, moral, to, the, story, hans, oranje, calls, such, questions, the, riddle, of, the, bacchae, and, says, that, the, play, concerns, itself, with, wisdom, cleverness, and, soundness, of, mind, the, extraordinary, beauty, and, passion, of, the, poetic, choral, descriptions, indicate, that, the, author, certainly, knew, what, attracted, those, who, followed, dionysus, the, vivid, gruesomeness, of, the, punishment, of, pentheus, suggests, that, he, could, also, understand, those, who, were, troubled, by, religion, at, one, time, the, interpretation, that, prevailed, was, that, the, play, was, an, expression, of, euripides, religious, devotion, as, though, after, a, life, of, being, critical, of, the, greek, gods, and, their, followers, the, author, finally, repented, of, his, cynicism, and, wrote, a, play, that, honors, dionysus, and, that, carries, a, dire, warning, to, nonbelievers, then, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, the, opposite, idea, began, to, take, hold, it, was, thought, that, euripides, was, doing, with, the, bacchae, what, he, had, always, done, pointing, out, the, inadequacy, of, the, greek, gods, and, religions, the, dionysus, in, euripides, tale, is, a, young, god, angry, that, his, mortal, family, the, royal, house, of, cadmus, has, denied, him, a, place, of, honor, as, a, deity, his, mortal, mother, semele, was, a, mistress, of, zeus, and, while, pregnant, was, tricked, by, a, jealous, hera, to, request, zeus, to, come, to, her, in, his, true, form, being, only, a, mortal, she, was, struck, down, by, zeus, thunderbolts, while, in, his, presence, and, was, killed, zeus, then, saved, dionysus, who, was, in, semele, s, womb, by, sewing, him, into, a, cavity, in, his, thigh, when, semele, died, her, sisters, said, it, was, zeus, will, and, accused, her, of, lying, they, also, accused, their, father, cadmus, of, claiming, semele, was, pregnant, by, zeus, to, cover, up, an, affair, with, a, mortal, man, most, of, semele, s, family, refused, to, believe, dionysus, was, the, son, of, zeus, and, the, young, god, was, spurned, by, his, household, he, traveled, throughout, asia, and, other, foreign, lands, gathering, a, cult, of, female, worshipers, the, maenads, at, the, start, of, the, play, dionysus, returns, to,

clean, dionysus, still, in, disguise, persuades, pentheus, to, forgo, his, plan, to, defeat, and, massacre, the, women, with, an, armed, force, he, says, it, would, be, better, first, to, spy, on, them, while, disguised, as, a, female, maenad, to, avoid, detection, dressing, pentheus, in, this, fashion, giving, him, a, thyrsus, and, fawn, skins, dionysus, leads, him, out, of, the, house, at, this, point, pentheus, seems, already, crazed, by, the, god, s, power, as, he, thinks, he, sees, two, suns, in, the, sky, and, believes, he, now, has, the, strength, to, rip, up, mountains, with, his,

and, place, the, king, in, its, highest, branches, then, dionysus, revealing, himself, called, out, to, his, followers, and, pointed, out, the, man, in, the, tree, this, drove, the, maenads, wild, led, by, agave, his, mother, they, forced, the, trapped, pentheus, down, from, the, tree, top, ripped, off, his, limbs, and, his, head, and, tore, his, body, into, pieces, after, the, messenger, has,
