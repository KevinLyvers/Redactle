indian, writers, rushdie, s, innovative, use, of, magic, realism, allowed, him, to, employ, the, nation, as, family, allegory, and, at, the, same, time, confound, it, with, an, impossible, telepathy, among, a, multitude, of, children, from, a, multitude, of, languages, cultures, regions, and, religions, no, one, genre, dominates, the, entire, novel, however, it, encompasses, the, comic, and, the,
