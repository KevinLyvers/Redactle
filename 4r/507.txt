brotherhood, prb, later, known, as, the, pre, raphaelites, was, a, group, of, english, painters, poets, and, art, critics, founded, in, 1848, by, william, holman, hunt, john, everett, millais, dante, gabriel, rossetti, william, michael, rossetti, james, collinson, frederic, george, stephens, and, thomas, woolner, who, formed, a, seven, member, brotherhood, partly, modelled, on, the, nazarene, movement, the, brotherhood, was, only, ever, a, loose, association, and, their, principles, were, shared, by, other, artists, of, the, time, including, ford, madox, brown, arthur, hughes, and, marie, spartali, stillman, later, followers, of, the, principles, of, the, brotherhood, included, edward, burne, jones, william, morris, and, john, william, waterhouse, the, group, sought, a, return, to, the, abundant, detail, intense, colours, and, complex, compositions, of, quattrocento, italian, art, they, rejected, what, they, regarded, as, the, mechanistic, approach, first, adopted, by, mannerist, artists, who, succeeded, raphael, and, michelangelo, the, brotherhood, believed, the, classical, poses, and, elegant, compositions, of, raphael, in, particular, had, been, a, corrupting, influence, on, the, academic, teaching, of, art, hence, the, name, pre, raphaelite, in, particular, the, group, objected, to, the, influence, of, sir, joshua, reynolds, founder, of, the, english, royal, academy, of, arts, whom, they, called, sir, sloshua, to, the, pre, raphaelites, according, to, william, michael, rossetti, sloshy, meant, anything, lax, or, scamped, in, the, process, of, painting, and, hence, any, thing, or, person, of, a, commonplace, or, conventional, kind, the, group, associated, their, work, with, john, ruskin, an, english, critic, whose, influences, were, driven, by, his, religious, background, christian, themes, were, abundant, the, group, continued, to, accept, the, concepts, of, history, painting, and, mimesis, imitation, of, nature, as, central, to, the, purpose, of, art, the, pre, raphaelites, defined, themselves, as, a, reform, movement, created, a, distinct, name, for, their, form, of, art, and, published, a, periodical, the, germ, to, promote, their, ideas, the, group, s, debates, were, recorded, in, the, pre, raphaelite, journal, the, brotherhood, separated, after, almost, five, years, the, pre, raphaelite, brotherhood, was, founded, in, john, millais, s, parents, house, on, gower, street, london, in, 1848, at, the, first, meeting, the, painters, john, everett, millais, dante, gabriel, rossetti, and, william, holman, hunt, were, present, hunt, and, millais, were, students, at, the, royal, academy, of, arts, and, had, met, in, another, loose, association, the, cyclographic, club, a, sketching, society, at, his, own, request, rossetti, became, a, pupil, of, ford, madox, brown, in, 1848, at, that, date, rossetti, and, hunt, shared, lodgings, in, cleveland, street, fitzrovia, central, london, hunt, had, started, painting, the, eve, of, st, agnes, based, on, keats, s, poem, of, the, same, name, but, it, was, not, completed, until, 1867, as, an, aspiring, poet, rossetti, wished, to, develop, the, links, between, romantic, poetry, and, art, by, autumn, four, more, members, painters, james, collinson, and, frederic, george, stephens, rossetti, s, brother, poet, and, critic, william, michael, rossetti, and, sculptor, thomas, woolner, had, joined, to, form, a, seven, member, strong, brotherhood, ford, madox, brown, was, invited, to, join, but, the, more, senior, artist, remained, independent, but, supported, the, group, throughout, the, prb, period, of, pre, raphaelitism, and, contributed, to, the, germ, other, young, painters, and, sculptors, became, close, associates, including, charles, allston, collins, and, alexander, munro, the, prb, intended, to, keep, the, existence, of, the, brotherhood, secret, from, members, of, the, royal, academy, the, brotherhood, s, early, doctrines, as, defined, by, william, michael, rossetti, were, expressed, in, four, declarations, the, principles, were, deliberately, non, dogmatic, since, the, brotherhood, wished, to, emphasise, the, personal, responsibility, of, individual, artists, to, determine, their, own, ideas, and, methods, of, depiction, influenced, by, romanticism, the, members, thought, freedom, and, responsibility, were, inseparable, nevertheless, they, were, particularly, fascinated, by, medieval, culture, believing, it, to, possess, a, spiritual, and, creative, integrity, that, had, been, lost, in, later, eras, the, emphasis, on, medieval, culture, clashed, with, principles, of, realism, which, stress, the, independent, observation, of, nature, in, its, early, stages, the, pre, raphaelite, brotherhood, believed, its, two, interests, were, consistent, with, one, another, but, in, later, years, the, movement, divided, and, moved, in, two, directions, the, realists, were, led, by, hunt, and, millais, while, the, medievalists, were, led, by, rossetti, and, his, followers, edward, burne, jones, and, william, morris, the, split, was, never, absolute, since, both, factions, believed, that, art, was, essentially, spiritual, in, character, opposing, their, idealism, to, the, materialist, realism, associated, with, courbet, and, impressionism, the, pre, raphaelite, brotherhood, was, greatly, influenced, by, nature, and, its, members, used, great, detail, to, show, the, natural, world, using, bright, and, sharp, focus, techniques, on, a, white, canvas, in, attempts, to, revive, the, brilliance, of, colour, found, in, quattrocento, art, hunt, and, millais, developed, a, technique, of, painting, in, thin, glazes, of, pigment, over, a, wet, white, ground, in, the, hope, that, the, colours, would, retain, jewel, like, transparency, and, clarity, their, emphasis, on, brilliance, of, colour, was, a, reaction, to, the, excessive, use, of, bitumen, by, earlier, british, artists, such, as, reynolds, david, wilkie, and, benjamin, robert, haydon, bitumen, produces, unstable, areas, of, muddy, darkness, an, effect, the, pre, raphaelites, despised, in, 1848, rossetti, and, hunt, made, a, list, of, immortals, artistic, heroes, whom, they, admired, especially, from, literature, some, of, whose, work, would, form, subjects, for, prb, paintings, notably, including, keats, and, tennyson, the, first, exhibitions, of, pre, raphaelite, work, occurred, in, 1849, both, millais, s, isabella, 1848, 1849, and, holman, hunt, s, rienzi, 1848, 1849, were, exhibited, at, the, royal, academy, rossetti, s, the, girlhood, of, mary, virgin, was, shown, at, a, free, exhibition, on, hyde, park, corner, as, agreed, all, members, of, the, brotherhood, signed, their, work, with, their, name, and, the, initials, prb, between, january, and, april, 1850, the, group, published, a, literary, magazine, the, germ, edited, by, william, rossetti, which, published, poetry, by, the, rossettis, woolner, and, collinson, and, essays, on, art, and, literature, by, associates, of, the, brotherhood, such, as, coventry, patmore, as, the, short, run, time, implies, the, magazine, did, not, manage, to, achieve, sustained, momentum, daly, 1989, in, 1850, the, pre, raphaelite, brotherhood, became, the, subject, of, controversy, after, the, exhibition, of, millais, painting, christ, in, the, house, of, his, parents, was, considered, to, be, blasphemous, by, many, reviewers, notably, charles, dickens, dickens, considered, millais, s, mary, to, be, ugly, millais, had, used, his, sister, in, law, mary, hodgkinson, as, the, model, for, mary, in, his, painting, the, brotherhood, s, medievalism, was, attacked, as, backward, looking, and, its, extreme, devotion, to, detail, was, condemned, as, ugly, and, jarring, to, the, eye, according, to, dickens, millais, made, the, holy, family, look, like, alcoholics, and, slum, dwellers, adopting, contorted, and, absurd, medieval, poses, after, the, controversy, james, collinson, resigned, from, the, brotherhood, due, to, his, belief, that, it, was, bringing, the, christian, religion, into, disrepute, the, remaining, members, met, to, discuss, whether, he, should, be, replaced, by, charles, allston, collins, or, walter, howell, deverell, but, were, unable, to, make, a, decision, from, that, point, the, group, disbanded, though, its, influence, continued, artists, who, had, worked, in, the, style, initially, continued, but, no, longer, signed, works, prb, the, brotherhood, found, support, from, the, critic, john, ruskin, who, praised, its, devotion, to, nature, and, rejection, of, conventional, methods, of, composition, the, pre, raphaelites, were, influenced, by, ruskin, s, theories, he, wrote, to, the, times, defending, their, work, and, subsequently, met, them, initially, he, favoured, millais, who, travelled, to, scotland, in, the, summer, of, 1853, with, ruskin, and, ruskin, s, wife, euphemia, chalmers, ruskin, n, e, gray, now, best, known, as, effie, gray, the, main, object, of, the, journey, was, to, paint, ruskin, s, portrait, effie, became, increasingly, attached, to, millais, creating, a, crisis, in, subsequent, annulment, proceedings, ruskin, himself, made, a, statement, to, his, lawyer, to, the, effect, that, his, marriage, had, been, unconsummated, the, marriage, was, annulled, on, grounds, of, non, consummation, leaving, effie, free, to, marry, millais, but, causing, a, public, scandal, millais, began, to, move, away, from, the, pre, raphaelite, style, after, his, marriage, and, ruskin, ultimately, attacked, his, later, works, ruskin, continued, to, support, hunt, and, rossetti, and, provided, funds, to, encourage, the, art, of, elizabeth, siddall, rossetti, s, wife, by, 1853, the, original, prb, had, virtually, dissolved, with, only, holman, hunt, remaining, true, to, its, stated, aims, but, the, term, pre, raphaelite, stuck, to, rossetti, and, others, including, william, morris, and, edward, burne, jones, with, whom, he, became, involved, in, oxford, in, 1857, hence, the, term, pre, raphaelite, is, associated, with, a, much, wider, and, long, lived, art, movement, artists, influenced, by, the, brotherhood, include, john, brett, philip, calderon, arthur, hughes, gustave, moreau, evelyn, de, morgan, frederic, sandys, who, entered, the, pre, raphaelite, circle, in, 1857, and, john, william, waterhouse, ford, madox, brown, who, was, associated, with, them, from, the, beginning, is, often, seen, as, most, closely, adopting, the, pre, raphaelite, principles, one, follower, who, developed, his, own, distinct, style, was, aubrey, beardsley, who, was, pre, eminently, influenced, by, burne, jones, after, 1856, dante, gabriel, rossetti, became, an, inspiration, for, the, medievalising, strand, of, the, movement, he, was, the, link, between, the, two, types, of, pre, raphaelite, painting, nature, and, romance, after, the, prb, became, lost, in, the, later, decades, of, the, century, rossetti, although, the, least, committed, to, the, brotherhood, continued, the, name, and, changed, its, style, he, began, painting, versions, of, femme, fatales, using, models, including, jane, morris, in, paintings, such, as, proserpine, the, day, dream, and, la, pia, de, tolomei, his, work, influenced, his, friend, william, morris, in, whose, firm, morris, marshall, faulkner, co, he, became, a, partner, and, with, whose, wife, jane, he, may, have, had, an, affair, ford, madox, brown, and, edward, burne, jones, also, became, partners, in, the, firm, through, morris, s, company, the, ideals, of, the, pre, raphaelite, brotherhood, influenced, many, interior, designers, and, architects, arousing, interest, in, medieval, designs, and, other, crafts, leading, to, the, arts, and, crafts, movement, headed, by, william, morris, holman, hunt, was, involved, with, the, movement, to, reform, design, through, the, della, robbia, pottery, company, after, 1850, hunt, and, millais, moved, away, from, direct, imitation, of, medieval, art, they, stressed, the, realist, and, scientific, aspects, of, the, movement, though, hunt, continued, to, emphasise, the, spiritual, significance, of, art, seeking, to, reconcile, religion, and, science, by, making, accurate, observations, and, studies, of, locations, in, egypt, and, palestine, for, his, paintings, on, biblical, subjects, in, contrast, millais, abandoned, pre, raphaelitism, after, 1860, adopting, a, much, broader, and, looser, style, influenced, by, reynolds, william, morris, and, others, condemned, his, reversal, of, principles, pre, raphaelitism, had, a, significant, impact, in, scotland, and, on, scottish, artists, the, figure, in, scottish, art, most, associated, with, the, pre, raphaelites, was, the, aberdeen, born, william, dyce, 1806, 1864, dyce, befriended, the, young, pre, raphaelites, in, london, and, introduced, their, work, to, ruskin, his, later, work, was, pre, raphaelite, in, its, spirituality, as, can, be, seen, in, his, the, man, of, sorrows, and, david, in, the, wilderness, both, 1860, which, contain, a, pre, raphaelite, attention, to, detail, joseph, noel, paton, 1821, 1901, studied, at, the, royal, academy, schools, in, london, where, he, became, a, friend, of, millais, and, he, subsequently, followed, him, into, pre, raphaelitism, producing, pictures, that, stressed, detail, and, melodrama, such, as, the, bludie, tryst, 1855, his, later, paintings, like, those, of, millais, have, been, criticised, for, descending, into, popular, sentimentality, also, influenced, by, millais, was, james, archer, 1823, 1904, whose, work, includes, summertime, gloucestershire, 1860, and, who, from, 1861, began, a, series, of, arthurian, based, paintings, including, la, morte, d, arthur, and, sir, lancelot, and, queen, guinevere, pre, raphaelism, also, inspired, painters, like, lawrence, alma, tadema, the, movement, influenced, many, later, british, artists, into, the, 20th, century, rossetti, came, to, be, seen, as, a, precursor, of, the, wider, european, symbolist, movement, there, is, evidence, to, suggest, that, a, number, of, paintings, by, the, german, artist, paula, modersohn, becker, were, influenced, by, rossetti, birmingham, museum, art, gallery, has, a, world, renowned, collection, of, works, by, burne, jones, and, the, pre, raphaelites, that, some, claim, strongly, influenced, the, young, j, r, r, tolkien, who, wrote, the, hobbit, and, the, lord, of, the, rings, with, influences, taken, from, the, same, mythological, scenes, portrayed, by, the, pre, raphaelites, tolkien, considered, his, own, group, of, school, friends, and, artistic, associates, the, so, called, tcbs, as, a, group, in, the, vein, of, the, pre, raphaelites, in, the, 20th, century, artistic, ideals, changed, and, art, moved, away, from, representing, reality, after, the, first, world, war, pre, raphaelite, art, was, devalued, for, its, literary, qualities, and, was, scorned, by, critics, as, sentimental, and, concocted, artistic, bric, a, brac, in, the, 1960s, there, was, a, major, revival, of, pre, raphaelitism, exhibitions, and, catalogues, of, works, culminating, in, a, 1984, exhibition, in, london, s, tate, gallery, re, established, a, canon, of, pre, raphaelite, work, among, many, other, exhibitions, there, was, another, large, show, at, tate, britain, in, 2012, 13, in, the, late, 20th, century, the, brotherhood, of, ruralists, based, its, aims, on, pre, raphaelitism, while, the, stuckists, and, the, birmingham, group, have, also, derived, inspiration, from, it, many, members, of, the, inner, pre, raphaelite, circle, dante, gabriel, rossetti, john, everett, millais, william, holman, hunt, ford, madox, brown, edward, burne, jones, and, outer, circle, frederick, sandys, arthur, hughes, simeon, solomon, henry, hugh, armstead, joseph, noel, paton, frederic, shields, matthew, james, lawless, were, working, concurrently, in, painting, illustration, and, sometimes, poetry, victorian, morality, judged, literature, as, superior, to, painting, because, of, its, noble, grounds, for, noble, emotion, robert, buchanan, a, writer, and, opponent, of, the, pre, raphaelite, brotherhood, felt, so, strongly, about, this, artistic, hierarchy, that, he, wrote, the, truth, is, that, literature, and, more, particularly, poetry, is, in, a, very, bad, way, when, one, art, gets, hold, of, another, and, imposes, upon, it, its, conditions, and, limitations, this, was, the, hostile, environment, in, which, pre, raphaelites, were, defiantly, working, in, various, media, the, pre, raphaelites, attempted, to, revitalize, subject, painting, which, had, been, dismissed, as, artificial, their, belief, that, each, picture, should, tell, a, story, was, an, important, step, for, the, unification, of, painting, and, literature, eventually, deemed, the, sister, arts, or, at, least, a, break, in, the, rigid, hierarchy, promoted, by, writers, like, robert, buchanan, the, pre, raphaelite, desire, for, more, extensive, affiliation, between, painting, and, literature, also, manifested, in, illustration, illustration, is, a, more, direct, unification, of, these, media, and, like, subject, painting, can, assert, a, narrative, of, its, own, for, the, pre, raphaelites, and, dante, gabriel, rossetti, specifically, there, was, anxiety, about, the, constraints, of, illustration, in, 1855, rossetti, wrote, to, william, allingham, about, the, independence, of, illustration, i, have, not, begun, even, designing, for, them, yet, but, fancy, i, shall, try, the, vision, of, sin, and, palace, of, art, etc, those, where, one, can, allegorize, on, one, s, own, hook, without, killing, for, oneself, and, everyone, a, distinct, idea, of, the, poet, s, this, passage, makes, apparent, rossetti, s, desire, to, not, just, support, the, poet, s, narrative, but, to, create, an, allegorical, illustration, that, functions, separately, from, the, text, as, well, in, this, respect, pre, raphaelite, illustrations, go, beyond, depicting, an, episode, from, a, poem, but, rather, function, like, subject, paintings, within, a, text, there, are, major, collections, of, pre, raphaelite, work, in, united, kingdom, museums, such, as, the, birmingham, museum, and, art, gallery, the, tate, gallery, victoria, and, albert, museum, manchester, art, gallery, lady, lever, art, gallery, and, liverpool, s, walker, art, gallery, the, art, gallery, of, south, australia, and, the, delaware,

everett, millais, dante, gabriel, rossetti, and, frederic, sandys, the, ger, eenens, collection, the, netherlands, includes, a, work, by, john, collier, circe, signed, and, dated, 1885, that, was, exhibited, at, the, chicago, world, fair, 1893, the, british, exhibit, occupied, 14, rooms, showcased, a, theme, familiar, with, the, fair, s, outlook, hence, they, had, a, sizeable, exhibit, of, pre,
