romanesque, art, is, the, art, of, europe, from, approximately, 1000, ad, to, the, rise, of, the, gothic, style, in, the, 12th, century, or, later, depending, on, region, the, preceding, period, is, known, as, the, pre, romanesque, period, the, term, was, invented, by, 19th, century, art, historians, especially, for, romanesque, architecture, which, retained, many, basic, features, of, roman, architectural, style, most, notably, round, headed, arches, but, also, barrel, vaults, apses, and, acanthus, leaf, decoration, but, had, also, developed, many, very, different, characteristics, in, southern, france, spain, and, italy, there, was, an, architectural, continuity, with, the, late, antique, but, the, romanesque, style, was, the, first, style, to, spread, across, the, whole, of, catholic, europe, from, sicily, to, scandinavia, romanesque, art, was, also, greatly, influenced, by, byzantine, art, especially, in, painting, and, by, the, anti, classical, energy, of, the, decoration, of, the, insular, art, of, the, british, isles, from, these, elements, was, forged, a, highly, innovative, and, coherent, style, outside, romanesque, architecture, the, art, of, the, period, was, characterised, by, a, vigorous, style, in, both, sculpture, and, painting, the, latter, continued, to, follow, essentially, byzantine, iconographic, models, for, the, most, common, subjects, in, churches, which, remained, christ, in, majesty, the, last, judgment, and, scenes, from, the, life, of, christ, in, illuminated, manuscripts, more, originality, is, seen, as, new, scenes, needed, to, be, depicted, the, most, lavishly, decorated, manuscripts, of, this, period, were, bibles, and, psalters, the, same, originality, applied, to, the, capitals, of, columns, which, were, often, carved, with, complete, scenes, with, several, figures, the, large, wooden, crucifix, was, a, german, innovation, at, the, very, start, of, the, period, as, were, free, standing, statues, of, the, enthroned, madonna, high, relief, was, the, dominant, sculptural, mode, of, the, period, colours, were, very, striking, and, mostly, primary, presently, these, colours, can, typically, only, be, seen, in, their, original, vividness, in, samples, of, stained, glass, and, well, preserved, manuscripts, stained, glass, became, widely, used, although, few, survive, today, in, an, invention, of, the, period, the, tympanums, of, important, church, portals, were, carved, with, monumental, schemes, often, christ, in, majesty, or, the, last, judgement, but, treated, with, more, freedom, than, painted, versions, as, there, were, no, equivalent, byzantine, models, compositions, usually, had, little, depth, and, needed, to, be, flexible, to, be, fit, into, the, shapes, of, historiated, initials, column, capitals, and, church, tympanums, the, tension, between, a, tightly, enclosing, frame, from, which, the, composition, sometimes, escapes, is, a, recurrent, theme, in, romanesque, art, figures, often, varied, in, size, in, relation, to, their, importance, landscape, backgrounds, if, employed, at, all, were, closer, to, abstract, decorations, than, realism, as, in, the, trees, in, the, morgan, leaf, portraiture, hardly, existed, during, this, period, europe, grew, steadily, more, prosperous, and, art, of, the, highest, quality, was, no, longer, confined, as, it, largely, was, in, the, carolingian, and, ottonian, periods, to, the, royal, court, and, a, small, circle, of, monasteries, monasteries, continued, to, be, extremely, important, especially, those, of, the, expansionist, new, orders, of, the, period, the, cistercian, cluniac, and, carthusian, which, spread, across, europe, but, city, churches, those, on, pilgrimage, routes, and, many, churches, in, small, towns, and, villages, were, elaborately, decorated, to, a, very, high, standard, these, are, often, the, structures, to, have, survived, when, cathedrals, and, city, churches, have, been, rebuilt, no, romanesque, royal, palace, has, really, survived, the, lay, artist, was, becoming, a, valued, figure, nicholas, of, verdun, seems, to, have, been, known, across, the, continent, most, masons, and, goldsmiths, were, now, lay, and, lay, painters, such, as, master, hugo, seem, to, have, been, in, the, majority, at, least, of, those, doing, the, best, work, by, the, end, of, the, period, the, iconography, of, their, church, work, was, no, doubt, arrived, at, in, consultation, with, clerical, advisors, precious, objects, in, these, media, had, a, very, high, status, in, the, period, probably, much, more, so, than, paintings, the, names, of, more, makers, of, these, objects, are, known, than, those, of, contemporary, painters, illuminators, or, architect, masons, metalwork, including, decoration, in, enamel, became, very, sophisticated, many, spectacular, shrines, made, to, hold, relics, have, survived, of, which, the, best, known, is, the, shrine, of, the, three, kings, at, cologne, cathedral, by, nicholas, of, verdun, and, others, c, 1180, 1225, the, stavelot, triptych, and, reliquary, of, st, maurus, are, other, examples, of, mosan, enamelwork, large, reliquaries, and, altar, frontals, were, built, around, a, wooden, frame, but, smaller, caskets, were, all, metal, and, enamel, a, few, secular, pieces, such, as, mirror, cases, jewellery, and, clasps, have, survived, but, these, no, doubt, under, represent, the, amount, of, fine, metalwork, owned, by, the, nobility, the, bronze, gloucester, candlestick, and, the, brass, font, of, 1108, 1117, now, in, li, ge, are, superb, examples, very, different, in, style, of, metal, casting, the, former, is, highly, intricate, and, energetic, drawing, on, manuscript, painting, while, the, font, shows, the, mosan, style, at, its, most, classical, and, majestic, the, bronze, doors, a, triumphal, column, and, other, fittings, at, hildesheim, cathedral, the, gniezno, doors, and, the, doors, of, the, basilica, di, san, zeno, in, verona, are, other, substantial, survivals, the, aquamanile, a, container, for, water, to, wash, with, appears, to, have, been, introduced, to, europe, in, the, 11th, century, artisans, often, gave, the, pieces, fantastic, zoomorphic, forms, surviving, examples, are, mostly, in, brass, many, wax, impressions, from, impressive, seals, survive, on, charters, and, documents, although, romanesque, coins, are, generally, not, of, great, aesthetic, interest, the, cloisters, cross, is, an, unusually, large, ivory, crucifix, with, complex, carving, including, many, figures, of, prophets, and, others, which, has, been, attributed, to, one, of, the, relatively, few, artists, whose, name, is, known, master, hugo, who, also, illuminated, manuscripts, like, many, pieces, it, was, originally, partly, coloured, the, lewis, chessmen, are, well, preserved, examples, of, small, ivories, of, which, many, pieces, or, fragments, remain, from, croziers, plaques, pectoral, crosses, and, similar, objects, with, the, fall, of, the, western, roman, empire, the, tradition, of, carving, large, works, in, stone, and, sculpting, figures, in, bronze, died, out, as, it, effectively, did, for, religious, reasons, in, the, byzantine, eastern, roman, world, some, life, size, sculpture, was, evidently, done, in, stucco, or, plaster, but, surviving, examples, are, understandably, rare, the, best, known, surviving, large, sculptural, work, of, proto, romanesque, europe, is, the, life, size, wooden, crucifix, commissioned, by, archbishop, gero, of, cologne, in, about, 960, 965, apparently, the, prototype, of, what, became, a, popular, form, these, were, later, set, up, on, a, beam, below, the, chancel, arch, known, in, english, as, a, rood, from, the, twelfth, century, accompanied, by, figures, of, the, virgin, mary, and, john, the, evangelist, to, the, sides, during, the, 11th, and, 12th, centuries, figurative, sculpture, strongly, revived, and, architectural, reliefs, are, a, hallmark, of, the, later, romanesque, period, figurative, sculpture, was, based, on, two, other, sources, in, particular, manuscript, illumination, and, small, scale, sculpture, in, ivory, and, metal, the, extensive, friezes, sculpted, on, armenian, and, syriac, churches, have, been, proposed, as, another, likely, influence, these, sources, together, produced, a, distinct, style, which, can, be, recognised, across, europe, although, the, most, spectacular, sculptural, projects, are, concentrated, in, south, western, france, northern, spain, and, italy, images, that, occurred, in, metalwork, were, frequently, embossed, the, resultant, surface, had, two, main, planes, and, details, that, were, usually, incised, this, treatment, was, adapted, to, stone, carving, and, is, seen, particularly, in, the, tympanum, above, the, portal, where, the, imagery, of, christ, in, majesty, with, the, symbols, of, the, four, evangelists, is, drawn, directly, from, the, gilt, covers, of, medieval, gospel, books, this, style, of, doorway, occurs, in, many, places, and, continued, into, the, gothic, period, a, rare, survival, in, england, is, that, of, the, prior, s, door, at, ely, cathedral, in, south, western, france, many, have, survived, with, impressive, examples, at, saint, pierre, moissac, souillac, and, la, madeleine, v, zelay, all, daughter, houses, of, cluny, with, extensive, other, sculpture, remaining, in, cloisters, and, other, buildings, nearby, autun, cathedral, has, a, last, judgement, of, great, rarity, in, that, it, has, uniquely, been, signed, by, its, creator, giselbertus, a, feature, of, the, figures, in, manuscript, illumination, is, that, they, often, occupy, confined, spaces, and, are, contorted, to, fit, the, custom, of, artists, to, make, the, figure, fit, the, available, space, lent, itself, to, a, facility, in, designing, figures, to, ornament, door, posts, and, lintels, and, other, such, architectural, surfaces, the, robes, of, painted, figures, were, commonly, treated, in, a, flat, and, decorative, style, that, bore, little, resemblance, to, the, weight, and, fall, of, actual, cloth, this, feature, was, also, adapted, for, sculpture, among, the, many, examples, that, exist, one, of, the, finest, is, the, figure, of, the, prophet, jeremiah, from, the, pillar, of, the, portal, of, the, abbey, of, saint, pierre, moissac, france, from, about, 1130, one, of, the, most, significant, motifs, of, romanesque, design, occurring, in, both, figurative, and, non, figurative, sculpture, is, the, spiral, one, of, the, sources, may, be, ionic, capitals, scrolling, vines, were, a, common, motif, of, both, byzantine, and, roman, design, and, may, be, seen, in, mosaic, on, the, vaults, of, the, 4th, century, church, of, santa, costanza, rome, manuscripts, and, architectural, carvings, of, the, 12th, century, have, very, similar, scrolling, vine, motifs, another, source, of, the, spiral, is, clearly, the, illuminated, manuscripts, of, the, 7th, to, 9th, centuries, particularly, irish, manuscripts, such, as, the, st, gall, gospel, book, spread, into, europe, by, the, hiberno, scottish, mission, in, these, illuminations, the, use, of, the, spiral, has, nothing, to, do, with, vines, or, other, plant, forms, the, motif, is, abstract, and, mathematical, the, style, was, then, picked, up, in, carolingian, art, and, given, a, more, botanical, character, it, is, in, an, adaptation, of, this, form, that, the, spiral, occurs, in, the, draperies, of, both, sculpture, and, stained, glass, windows, of, all, the, many, examples, that, occur, on, romanesque, portals, one, of, the, most, outstanding, is, that, of, the, central, figure, of, christ, at, la, madeleine, vezelay, another, influence, from, insular, art, are, engaged, and, entwined, animals, often, used, to, superb, effect, in, capitals, as, at, silos, and, sometimes, on, a, column, itself, as, at, moissac, much, of, the, treatment, of, paired, confronted, and, entwined, animals, in, romanesque, decoration, has, similar, insular, origins, as, do, animals, whose, bodies, tail, into, purely, decorative, shapes, despite, the, adoption, of, hiberno, saxon, traditions, into, romanesque, styles, in, england, and, on, the, continent, the, influence, was, primarily, one, way, irish, art, during, this, period, remained, isolated, developing, a, unique, amalgam, of, native, irish, and, viking, styles, which, would, be, slowly, extinguished, and, replaced, by, mainstream, romanesque, style, in, the, early, 13th, century, following, the, anglo, norman, invasion, of, ireland, most, romanesque, sculpture, is, pictorial, and, biblical, in, subject, a, great, variety, of, themes, are, found, on, capitals, and, include, scenes, of, creation, and, the, fall, of, man, episodes, from, the, life, of, christ, and, those, old, testament, scenes, which, prefigure, his, death, and, resurrection, such, as, jonah, and, the, whale, and, daniel, in, the, lions, den, many, nativity, scenes, occur, the, theme, of, the, three, kings, being, particularly, popular, the, cloisters, of, santo, domingo, de, silos, abbey, in, northern, spain, and, moissac, are, fine, examples, surviving, complete, as, are, the, relief, sculptures, on, the, many, tournai, fonts, found, in, churches, in, southern, england, france, and, belgium, a, feature, of, some, romanesque, churches, is, the, extensive, sculptural, scheme, which, covers, the, area, surrounding, the, portal, or, in, some, case, much, of, the, facade, angouleme, cathedral, in, france, has, a, highly, elaborate, scheme, of, sculpture, set, within, the, broad, niches, created, by, the, arcading, of, the, facade, in, the, spanish, region, of, catalonia, an, elaborate, pictorial, scheme, in, low, relief, surrounds, the, door, of, the, church, of, santa, maria, at, ripoll, the, purpose, of, the, sculptural, schemes, was, to, convey, a, message, that, the, christian, believer, should, recognize, wrongdoing, repent, and, be, redeemed, the, last, judgement, reminds, the, believer, to, repent, the, carved, or, painted, crucifix, displayed, prominently, within, the, church, reminds, the, sinner, of, redemption, often, the, sculpture, is, alarming, in, form, and, in, subject, matter, these, works, are, found, on, capitals, corbels, and, bosses, or, entwined, in, the, foliage, on, door, mouldings, they, represent, forms, that, are, not, easily, recognizable, today, common, motifs, include, sheela, na, gig, fearsome, demons, ouroboros, or, dragons, swallowing, their, tails, and, many, other, mythical, creatures, with, obscure, meaning, spirals, and, paired, motifs, originally, had, special, significance, in, oral, tradition, that, has, been, lost, or, rejected, by, modern, scholars, the, seven, deadly, sins, including, lust, gluttony, and, avarice, are, also, frequently, represented, the, appearance, of, many, figures, with, oversized, genitals, can, be, equated, with, carnal, sin, and, so, can, the, numerous, figures, shown, with, protruding, tongues, which, are, a, feature, of, the, doorway, of, lincoln, cathedral, pulling, one, s, beard, was, a, symbol, of, masturbation, and, pulling, one, s, mouth, wide, open, was, also, a, sign, of, lewdness, a, common, theme, found, on, capitals, of, this, period, is, a, tongue, poker, or, beard, stroker, being, beaten, by, his, wife, or, seized, by, demons, demons, fighting, over, the, soul, of, a, wrongdoer, such, as, a, miser, is, another, popular, subject, gothic, architecture, is, usually, considered, to, begin, with, the, design, of, the, choir, at, the, abbey, of, saint, denis, north, of, paris, by, the, abbot, suger, consecrated, 1144, the, beginning, of, gothic, sculpture, is, usually, dated, a, little, later, with, the, carving, of, the, figures, around, the, royal, portal, at, chartres, cathedral, france, 1150, 1155, the, style, of, sculpture, spread, rapidly, from, chartres, overtaking, the, new, gothic, architecture, in, fact, many, churches, of, the, late, romanesque, period, post, date, the, building, at, saint, denis, the, sculptural, style, based, more, upon, observation, and, naturalism, than, on, formalised, design, developed, rapidly, it, is, thought, that, one, reason, for, the, rapid, development, of, naturalistic, form, was, a, growing, awareness, of, classical, remains, in, places, where, they, were, most, numerous, and, a, deliberate, imitation, of, their, style, the, consequence, is, that, there, are, doorways, which, are, romanesque, in, form, and, yet, show, a, naturalism, associated, with, early, gothic, sculpture, one, of, these, is, the, p, rtico, da, gloria, dating, from, 1180, at, santiago, de, compostela, this, portal, is, internal, and, is, particularly, well, preserved, even, retaining, colour, on, the, figures, and, indicating, the, gaudy, appearance, of, much, architectural, decoration, which, is, now, perceived, as, monochrome, around, the, doorway, are, figures, who, are, integrated, with, the, colonnettes, that, make, the, mouldings, of, the, doors, they, are, three, dimensional, but, slightly, flattened, they, are, highly, individualised, not, only, in, appearance, but, also, expression, and, bear, quite, strong, resemblance, to, those, around, the, north, porch, of, the, abbey, of, st, denis, dating, from, 1170, beneath, the, tympanum, there, is, a, realistically, carved, row, of, figures, playing, a, range, of, different, and, easily, identifiable, musical, instruments, a, number, of, regional, schools, converged, in, the, early, romanesque, illuminated, manuscript, the, channel, school, of, england, and, northern, france, was, heavily, influenced, by, late, anglo, saxon, art, whereas, in, southern, france, the, style, depended, more, on, iberian, influence, and, in, germany, and, the, low, countries, ottonian, styles, continued, to, develop, and, also, along, with, byzantine, styles, influenced, italy, by, the, 12th, century, there, had, been, reciprocal, influences, between, all, these, although, naturally, regional, distinctiveness, remained, the, typical, foci, of, romanesque, illumination, were, the, bible, where, each, book, could, be, prefaced, by, a, large, historiated, initial, and, the, psalter, where, major, initials, were, similarly, illuminated, in, both, cases, more, lavish, examples, might, have, cycles, of, scenes, in, fully, illuminated, pages, sometimes, with, several, scenes, per, page, in, compartments, the, bibles, in, particular, often, had, a, and, might, be, bound, into, more, than, one, volume, examples, include, the, st, albans, psalter, hunterian, psalter, winchester, bible, the, morgan, leaf, shown, above, f, camp, bible, stavelot, bible, and, parc, abbey, bible, by, the, end, of, the, period, lay, commercial, workshops, of, artists, and, scribes, were, becoming, significant, and, illumination, and, books, generally, became, more, widely, available, to, both, laity, and, clergy, the, large, wall, surfaces, and, plain, curving, vaults, of, the, romanesque, period, lent, themselves, to, mural, decoration, unfortunately, many, of, these, early, wall, paintings, have, been, destroyed, by, damp, or, the, walls, have, been, replastered, and, painted, over, in, england, france, and, the, netherlands, such, pictures, were, systematically, destroyed, or, whitewashed, in, bouts, of, reformation, iconoclasm, murals, in, denmark, as, well, as, in, sweden, and, elsewhere, many, have, since, been, restored, in, catalonia, spain, there, was, a, campaign, to, save, such, murals, in, the, early, 20th, century, as, of, 1907, by, removing, them, and, transferring, them, to, safekeeping, in, barcelona, resulting, in, the, spectacular, collection, at, the, national, art, museum, of, catalonia, in, other, countries, they, have, suffered, from, war, neglect, and, changing, fashion, a, classic, scheme, for, the, full, painted, decoration, of, a, church, derived, from, earlier, examples, often, in, mosaic, had, as, its, focal, point, in, the, semi, dome, of, the, apse, christ, in, majesty, or, christ, the, redeemer, enthroned, within, a, mandorla, and, framed, by, the, four, winged, beasts, symbols, of, the, four, evangelists, comparing, directly, with, examples, from, the, gilt, covers, or, the, illuminations, of, gospel, books, of, the, period, if, the, virgin, mary, was, the, dedicatee, of, the, church, she, might, replace, christ, here, on, the, apse, walls, below, would, be, saints, and, apostles, perhaps, including, narrative, scenes, for, example, of, the, saint, to, whom, the, church, was, dedicated, on, the, sanctuary, arch, were, figures, of, apostles, prophets, or, the, twenty, four, elders, of, the, apocalypse, looking, in, towards, a, bust, of, christ, or, his, symbol, the, lamb, at, the, top, of, the, arch, the, north, wall, of, the, nave, would, contain, narrative, scenes, from, the, old, testament, and, the, south, wall, from, the, new, testament, on, the, rear, west, wall, would, be, a, last, judgement, with, an, enthroned, and, judging, christ, at, the, top, one, of, the, most, intact, schemes, to, exist, is, that, at, saint, savin, sur, gartempe, in, france, the, long, barrel, vault, of, the, nave, provides, an, excellent, surface, for, fresco, and, is, decorated, with, scenes, of, the, old, testament, showing, the, creation, the, fall, of, man, and, other, stories, including, a, lively, depiction, of, noah, s, ark, complete, with, a, fearsome, figurehead, and, numerous, windows, through, which, can, be, seen, noah, and, his, family, on, the, upper, deck, birds, on, the, middle, deck, while, on, the, lower, are, the, pairs, of, animals, another, scene, shows, with, great, vigour, the, swamping, of, pharaoh, s, army, by, the, red, sea, the, scheme, extends, to, other, parts, of, the, church, with, the, martyrdom, of, the, local, saints, shown, in, the, crypt, and, apocalypse, in, the, narthex, and, christ, in, majesty, the, range, of, colours, employed, is, limited, to, light, blue, green, yellow, ochre, reddish, brown, and, black, similar, paintings, exist, in, serbia, spain, germany, italy, and, elsewhere, in, france, the, now, dispersed, paintings, from, arlanza, in, the, province, of, burgos, spain, though, from, a, monastery, are, secular, in, subject, matter, showing, huge, and, vigorous, mythical, beasts, above, a, frieze, in, black, and, white, with, other, creatures, they, give, a, rare, idea, of, what, decorated, romanesque, palaces, would, have, contained, in, england, and, france, the, romanesque, period, saw, the, rise, of, pigaches, scorpion, tail, or, ram, s, horn, shoes, much, assailed, by, the, clergy, at, the, time, orderic, vitalis, in, particular, blamed, them, for, the, supposed, rise, in, sodomy, and, homosexuality, of, the, era, the, shoes, are, now, principally, remembered, as, precursors, to, the, much, more, extravagant, poulaines, that, became, popular, following, the, black, death, romanesque, embroidery, is, best, known, from, the, bayeux, tapestry, in, bayeux, france, or, the, tapestry, of, creation, in, girona, spain, but, many, more, closely, worked, pieces, of, opus, anglicanum, english, work, considered, the, finest, in, the, west, and, other, styles, have, survived, mostly, as, church, vestments, the, oldest, known, fragments, of, medieval, pictorial, stained, glass, appear, to, date, from, the, 10th, century, the, earliest, intact, figures, are, five, prophet, windows, at, augsburg, dating, from, the, late, 11th, century, the, figures, though, stiff, and, formalised, demonstrate, considerable, proficiency, in, design, both, pictorially, and, in, the, functional, use, of, the, glass, indicating, that, their, maker, was, well, accustomed, to, the, medium, at, le, mans, canterbury, and, chartres, cathedrals, and, saint, denis, a, number, of, panels, of, the, 12th, century, have, survived, at, canterbury, these, include, a, figure, of, adam, digging, and, another, of, his, son, seth, from, a, series, of, ancestors, of, christ, adam, represents, a, highly, naturalistic, and, lively, portrayal, while, in, the, figure, of, seth, the, robes, have, been, used, to, great, decorative, effect, similar, to, the, best, stone, carving, of, the, period, glass, craftsmen, were, slower, than, architects, to, change, their, style, and, much, glass, from, at, least, the, first, part, of, the, 13th, century, can, be, considered, as, essentially, romanesque, especially, fine, are, large, figures, of, 1200, from, strasbourg, cathedral, some, now, removed, to, the, museum, and, of, about, 1220, from, saint, kunibert, s, church, in, cologne, most, of, the, magnificent, stained, glass, of, france, including, the, famous, windows, of, chartres, date, from, the, 13th, century, far, fewer, large, windows, remain, intact, from, the, 12th, century, one, such, is, the, crucifixion, of, poitiers, a, remarkable, composition, which, rises, through, three, stages, the, lowest, with, a, quatrefoil, depicting, the, martyrdom, of, st, peter, the, largest, central, stage, dominated, by, the, crucifixion, and, the, upper, stage, showing, the, ascension, of, christ, in, a, mandorla, the, figure, of, the, crucified, christ, is, already, showing, the, gothic, curve, the, window, is, described, by, george, seddon, as, being, of, unforgettable, beauty, many, detached, fragments, are, in, museums, and, a, window, at, twycross, church, in, england, is, made, up, of, important, french, panels, rescued, from, the, french, revolution, glass, was, both, expensive, and, fairly, flexible, in, that, it, could, be, added, to, or, re, arranged, and, seems, to, have, been, often, re, used, when, churches, were, rebuilt, in, the, gothic, style, the, earliest, datable, english, glass, a, panel, in, york, minster, from, a, tree, of, jesse, probably, of, before, 1154, has, been, recycled, in, this, way
