the, communist, manifesto, german, das, kommunistische, manifest, originally, the, manifesto, of, the, communist, party, manifest, der, kommunistischen, partei, is, a, political, pamphlet, written, by, karl, marx, and, friedrich, engels, commissioned, by, the, communist, league, and, originally, published, in, london, in, 1848, the, text, is, the, first, and, most, systematic, attempt, by, marx, and, engels, to, codify, for, wide, consumption, the, historical, materialist, idea, that, the, history, of, all, hitherto, existing, society, is, the, history, of, class, struggles, in, which, social, classes, are, defined, by, the, relationship, of, people, to, the, means, of, production, published, amid, the, revolutions, of, 1848, in, europe, the, manifesto, remains, one, of, the, world, s, most, influential, political, documents, marx, and, engels, combine, philosophical, materialism, with, the, hegelian, dialectical, method, in, order, to, analyze, the, development, of, european, society, through, its, modes, of, production, including, primitive, communism, antiquity, feudalism, and, capitalism, noting, the, emergence, of, a, new, dominant, class, at, each, stage, the, text, outlines, the, relationship, between, the, means, of, production, relations, of, production, forces, of, production, and, the, mode, of, production, and, posits, that, changes, in, society, s, economic, base, affect, changes, in, its, superstructure, marx, and, engels, assert, that, capitalism, is, marked, by, the, exploitation, of, the, proletariat, working, class, of, wage, labourers, by, the, ruling, bourgeoisie, which, is, constantly, revolutionising, the, instruments, relations, of, production, and, with, them, the, whole, relations, of, society, they, argue, that, capital, s, need, for, a, flexible, labour, force, dissolves, the, old, relations, and, that, its, global, expansion, in, search, of, new, markets, creates, a, world, after, its, own, image, the, manifesto, concludes, that, capitalism, does, not, offer, humanity, the, possibility, of, self, realization, instead, ensuring, that, humans, are, perpetually, stunted, and, alienated, it, theorizes, that, capitalism, will, bring, about, its, own, destruction, by, polarizing, and, unifying, the, proletariat, and, predicts, that, a, revolution, will, lead, to, the, emergence, of, communism, a, classless, society, in, which, the, free, development, of, each, is, the, condition, for, the, free, development, of, all, marx, and, engels, propose, the, following, transitional, policies, the, abolition, of, private, property, in, land, and, inheritance, introduction, of, a, progressive, income, tax, confiscation, of, rebels, property, nationalisation, of, credit, communication, and, transport, expansion, and, integration, of, industry, and, agriculture, enforcement, of, universal, obligation, of, labour, and, provision, of, universal, education, and, abolition, of, child, labour, the, text, ends, with, three, decisive, sentences, reworked, and, popularized, into, the, famous, call, for, solidarity, the, slogan, workers, of, the, world, unite, you, have, nothing, to, lose, but, your, chains, the, communist, manifesto, is, divided, into, a, preamble, and, four, sections, the, introduction, begins, a, spectre, is, haunting, europe, the, spectre, of, communism, pointing, out, that, it, was, widespread, for, politicians, both, those, in, government, and, those, in, the, opposition, to, label, their, opponents, as, communists, the, authors, infer, that, those, in, power, acknowledge, communism, to, be, a, power, in, itself, subsequently, the, introduction, exhorts, communists, to, openly, publish, their, views, and, aims, which, is, the, very, function, of, the, manifesto, the, first, section, of, the, manifesto, bourgeois, and, proletarians, outlines, historical, materialism, and, states, that, the, history, of, all, hitherto, existing, society, is, the, history, of, class, struggles, according, to, the, authors, all, societies, in, history, had, taken, the, form, of, an, oppressed, majority, exploited, by, an, oppressive, minority, in, marx, and, engels, time, they, say, that, under, capitalism, the, industrial, working, class, or, proletariat, engages, in, class, struggle, against, the, owners, of, the, means, of, production, the, bourgeoisie, the, bourgeoisie, through, the, constant, revolutionising, of, production, uninterrupted, disturbance, of, all, social, conditions, have, emerged, as, the, supreme, class, in, society, displacing, all, the, old, powers, of, feudalism, the, bourgeoisie, constantly, exploits, the, proletariat, for, its, labour, power, creating, profit, for, themselves, and, accumulating, capital, in, doing, so, however, marx, and, engels, describe, the, bourgeoisie, as, serving, as, its, own, grave, diggers, as, they, believe, the, proletariat, will, inevitably, become, conscious, of, their, own, potential, and, rise, to, power, through, revolution, overthrowing, the, bourgeoisie, proletarians, and, communists, the, second, section, starts, by, stating, the, relationship, of, conscious, communists, i, e, those, who, identify, as, communists, to, the, rest, of, the, working, class, the, communists, party, will, not, oppose, other, working, class, parties, but, unlike, them, it, will, express, the, general, will, and, defend, the, common, interests, of, the, world, s, proletariat, as, a, whole, independent, of, all, nationalities, the, section, goes, on, to, defend, communism, from, various, objections, including, claims, that, it, advocates, communal, prostitution, or, disincentivises, people, from, working, the, section, ends, by, outlining, a, set, of, short, term, demands, among, them, a, progressive, income, tax, abolition, of, inheritances, and, private, property, abolition, of, child, labour, free, public, education, nationalisation, of, the, means, of, transport, and, communication, centralisation, of, credit, via, a, national, bank, expansion, of, publicly, owned, land, etc, the, implementation, of, which, is, argued, would, result, in, the, precursor, to, a, stateless, and, classless, society, the, third, section, socialist, and, communist, literature, distinguishes, communism, from, other, socialist, doctrines, prevalent, at, the, time, these, being, broadly, categorised, as, reactionary, socialism, conservative, or, bourgeois, socialism, and, critical, utopian, socialism, and, communism, while, the, degree, of, reproach, toward, rival, perspectives, varies, all, are, dismissed, for, advocating, reformism, and, failing, to, recognise, the, pre, eminent, revolutionary, role, of, the, working, class, position, of, the, communists, in, relation, to, the, various, opposition, parties, the, concluding, section, of, the, manifesto, briefly, discusses, the, communist, position, on, struggles, in, specific, countries, in, the, mid, nineteenth, century, such, as, in, france, switzerland, poland, and, lastly, germany, which, is, said, to, be, on, the, eve, of, a, bourgeois, revolution, and, predicts, that, a, world, revolution, will, soon, follow, it, ends, by, declaring, an, alliance, with, the, democratic, socialists, boldly, supporting, other, communist, revolutions, and, calling, for, united, international, proletarian, action, working, men, of, all, countries, unite, in, spring, 1847, marx, and, engels, joined, the, league, of, the, just, who, were, quickly, convinced, by, the, duo, s, ideas, of, critical, communism, at, its, first, congress, in, 2, 9, june, the, league, tasked, engels, with, drafting, a, profession, of, faith, but, such, a, document, was, later, deemed, inappropriate, for, an, open, non, confrontational, organisation, engels, nevertheless, wrote, the, draft, of, a, communist, confession, of, faith, detailing, the, league, s, programme, a, few, months, later, in, october, engels, arrived, at, the, league, s, paris, branch, to, find, that, moses, hess, had, written, an, inadequate, manifesto, for, the, group, now, called, the, league, of, communists, in, hess, s, absence, engels, severely, criticised, this, manifesto, and, convinced, the, rest, of, the, league, to, entrust, him, with, drafting, a, new, one, this, became, the, draft, principles, of, communism, described, as, less, of, a, credo, and, more, of, an, exam, paper, on, 23, november, just, before, the, communist, league, s, second, congress, 29, november, 8, december, 1847, engels, wrote, to, marx, expressing, his, desire, to, eschew, the, catechism, format, in, favour, of, the, manifesto, because, he, felt, it, must, contain, some, history, on, the, 28th, marx, and, engels, met, at, ostend, in, belgium, and, a, few, days, later, gathered, at, the, soho, london, headquarters, of, the, german, workers, education, association, to, attend, the, congress, over, the, next, ten, days, intense, debate, raged, between, league, functionaries, marx, eventually, dominated, the, others, and, overcoming, stiff, and, prolonged, opposition, in, harold, laski, s, words, secured, a, majority, for, his, programme, the, league, thus, unanimously, adopted, a, far, more, combative, resolution, than, that, at, the, first, congress, in, june, marx, especially, and, engels, were, subsequently, commissioned, to, draw, up, a, manifesto, for, the, league, upon, returning, to, brussels, marx, engaged, in, ceaseless, procrastination, according, to, his, biographer, francis, wheen, working, only, intermittently, on, the, manifesto, he, spent, much, of, his, time, delivering, lectures, on, political, economy, at, the, german, workers, education, association, writing, articles, for, the, deutsche, br, sseler, zeitung, and, giving, a, long, speech, on, free, trade, following, this, he, even, spent, a, week, 17, 26, january, 1848, in, ghent, to, establish, a, branch, of, the, democratic, association, there, subsequently, having, not, heard, from, marx, for, nearly, two, months, the, central, committee, of, the, communist, league, sent, him, an, ultimatum, on, 24, or, 26, january, demanding, he, submit, the, completed, manuscript, by, 1, february, this, imposition, spurred, marx, on, who, struggled, to, work, without, a, deadline, and, he, seems, to, have, rushed, to, finish, the, job, in, time, for, evidence, of, this, historian, eric, hobsbawm, points, to, the, absence, of, rough, drafts, only, one, page, of, which, survives, in, all, the, manifesto, was, written, over, 6, 7, weeks, although, engels, is, credited, as, co, writer, the, final, draft, was, penned, exclusively, by, marx, from, the, 26, january, letter, laski, infers, that, even, the, communist, league, considered, marx, to, be, the, sole, draftsman, and, that, he, was, merely, their, agent, imminently, replaceable, further, engels, himself, wrote, in, 1883, the, basic, thought, running, through, the, manifesto, belongs, solely, and, exclusively, to, marx, although, laski, does, not, disagree, he, suggests, that, engels, underplays, his, own, contribution, with, characteristic, modesty, and, points, out, the, close, resemblance, between, its, substance, and, that, of, the, laski, argues, that, while, writing, the, manifesto, marx, drew, from, the, joint, stock, of, ideas, he, developed, with, engels, a, kind, of, intellectual, bank, account, upon, which, either, could, draw, freely, in, late, february, 1848, the, manifesto, was, anonymously, published, by, the, workers, educational, association, kommunistischer, arbeiterbildungsverein, based, at, 46, liverpool, street, in, the, bishopsgate, without, area, of, the, city, of, london, written, in, german, the, 23, page, pamphlet, was, titled, manifest, der, kommunistischen, partei, and, had, a, dark, green, cover, it, was, reprinted, three, times, and, serialised, in, the, deutsche, londoner, zeitung, a, newspaper, for, german, migr, s, on, 4, march, one, day, after, the, serialisation, in, the, zeitung, began, marx, was, expelled, by, belgian, police, two, weeks, later, around, 20, march, a, thousand, copies, of, the, manifesto, reached, paris, and, from, there, to, germany, in, early, april, in, april, may, the, text, was, corrected, for, printing, and, punctuation, mistakes, marx, and, engels, would, use, this, 30, page, version, as, the, basis, for, future, editions, of, the, manifesto, although, the, manifesto, s, prelude, announced, that, it, was, to, be, published, in, the, english, french, german, italian, flemish, and, danish, languages, the, initial, printings, were, only, in, german, polish, and, danish, translations, soon, followed, the, german, original, in, london, and, by, the, end, of, 1848, a, swedish, translation, was, published, with, a, new, title, the, voice, of, communism, declaration, of, the, communist, party, in, november, 1850, the, manifesto, of, the, communist, party, was, published, in, english, for, the, first, time, when, george, julian, harney, serialised, helen, macfarlane, s, translation, in, his, chartist, newspaper, the, red, republican, her, version, begins, a, frightful, hobgoblin, stalks, throughout, europe, we, are, haunted, by, a, ghost, the, ghost, of, communism, for, her, translation, the, lancashire, based, macfarlane, probably, consulted, engels, who, had, abandoned, his, own, english, translation, half, way, harney, s, introduction, revealed, the, manifesto, s, hitherto, anonymous, authors, identities, for, the, first, time, a, french, translation, of, the, manifesto, was, published, just, before, the, working, class, june, days, uprising, was, crushed, its, influence, in, the, europe, wide, revolutions, of, 1848, was, restricted, to, germany, where, the, cologne, based, communist, league, and, its, newspaper, neue, rheinische, zeitung, edited, by, marx, played, an, important, role, within, a, year, of, its, establishment, in, may, 1849, the, zeitung, was, suppressed, marx, was, expelled, from, germany, and, had, to, seek, lifelong, refuge, in, london, in, 1851, members, of, the, communist, league, s, central, board, were, arrested, by, the, prussian, secret, police, at, their, trial, in, cologne, 18, months, later, in, late, 1852, they, were, sentenced, to, 3, 6, years, imprisonment, for, engels, the, revolution, was, forced, into, the, background, by, the, reaction, that, began, with, the, defeat, of, the, paris, workers, in, june, 1848, and, was, finally, excommunicated, by, law, in, the, conviction, of, the, cologne, communists, in, november, 1852, after, the, defeat, of, the, 1848, revolutions, the, manifesto, fell, into, obscurity, where, it, remained, throughout, the, 1850s, and, 1860s, hobsbawm, says, that, by, november, 1850, the, manifesto, had, become, sufficiently, scarce, for, marx, to, think, it, worth, reprinting, section, iii, in, the, last, issue, of, his, london, magazine, over, the, next, two, decades, only, a, few, new, editions, were, published, these, include, an, unauthorised, and, occasionally, inaccurate, 1869, russian, translation, by, mikhail, bakunin, in, geneva, and, an, 1866, edition, in, berlin, the, first, time, the, manifesto, was, published, in, germany, according, to, hobsbawm, by, the, middle, 1860s, virtually, nothing, that, marx, had, written, in, the, past, was, any, longer, in, print, however, john, cowell, stepney, did, publish, an, abridged, version, in, the, social, economist, in, august, september, 1869, in, time, for, the, basle, congress, in, the, early, 1870s, the, manifesto, and, its, authors, experienced, a, revival, in, fortunes, hobsbawm, identifies, three, reasons, for, this, the, first, is, the, leadership, role, marx, played, in, the, international, workingmen, s, association, aka, the, first, international, secondly, marx, also, came, into, much, prominence, among, socialists, and, equal, notoriety, among, the, authorities, for, his, support, of, the, paris, commune, of, 1871, elucidated, in, the, civil, war, in, france, lastly, and, perhaps, most, significantly, in, the, popularisation, of, the, manifesto, was, the, treason, trial, of, the, social, democratic, workers, party, of, germany, sdap, leaders, during, the, trial, prosecutors, read, the, manifesto, out, loud, as, evidence, this, meant, that, the, pamphlet, could, legally, be, published, in, germany, thus, in, 1872, marx, and, engels, rushed, out, a, new, german, language, edition, writing, a, preface, that, identified, that, several, portions, that, became, outdated, in, the, quarter, century, since, its, original, publication, this, edition, was, also, the, first, time, the, title, was, shortened, to, the, communist, manifesto, das, kommunistische, manifest, and, it, became, the, version, the, authors, based, future, editions, upon, between, 1871, and, 1873, the, manifesto, was, published, in, over, nine, editions, in, six, languages, on, 30, december, 1871, it, was, published, in, the, united, states, for, the, first, time, in, woodhull, claflin, s, weekly, of, new, york, city, however, by, the, mid, 1870s, the, communist, manifesto, remained, marx, and, engels, only, work, to, be, even, moderately, well, known, over, the, next, forty, years, as, social, democratic, parties, rose, across, europe, and, parts, of, the, world, so, did, the, publication, of, the, manifesto, alongside, them, in, hundreds, of, editions, in, thirty, languages, marx, and, engels, wrote, a, new, preface, for, the, 1882, russian, edition, translated, by, georgi, plekhanov, in, geneva, in, it, they, wondered, if, russia, could, directly, become, a, communist, society, or, if, she, would, become, capitalist, first, like, other, european, countries, after, marx, s, death, in, 1883, engels, provided, the, prefaces, for, five, editions, between, 1888, and, 1893, among, these, is, the, 1888, english, edition, translated, by, samuel, moore, and, approved, by, engels, who, also, provided, notes, throughout, the, text, it, has, been, the, standard, english, language, edition, ever, since, the, principal, region, of, its, influence, in, terms, of, editions, published, was, in, the, central, belt, of, europe, from, russia, in, the, east, to, france, in, the, west, in, comparison, the, pamphlet, had, little, impact, on, politics, in, southwest, and, southeast, europe, and, moderate, presence, in, the, north, outside, europe, chinese, and, japanese, translations, were, published, as, were, spanish, editions, in, latin, america, the, first, chinese, edition, of, the, book, was, translated, by, zhu, zhixin, after, the, 1905, russian, revolution, in, a, tongmenghui, newspaper, along, with, articles, on, socialist, movements, in, europe, north, america, and, japan, this, uneven, geographical, spread, in, the, manifesto, s, popularity, reflected, the, development, of, socialist, movements, in, a, particular, region, as, well, as, the, popularity, of, marxist, variety, of, socialism, there, there, was, not, always, a, strong, correlation, between, a, social, democratic, party, s, strength, and, the, manifesto, s, popularity, in, that, country, for, instance, the, german, spd, printed, only, a, few, thousand, copies, of, the, communist, manifesto, every, year, but, a, few, hundred, thousand, copies, of, the, erfurt, programme, further, the, mass, based, social, democratic, parties, of, the, second, international, did, not, require, their, rank, and, file, to, be, well, versed, in, theory, marxist, works, such, as, the, manifesto, or, das, kapital, were, read, primarily, by, party, theoreticians, on, the, other, hand, small, dedicated, militant, parties, and, marxist, sects, in, the, west, took, pride, in, knowing, the, theory, hobsbawm, says, this, was, the, milieu, in, which, the, clearness, of, a, comrade, could, be, gauged, invariably, from, the, number, of, earmarks, on, his, manifesto, following, the, october, revolution, of, 1917, that, swept, the, vladimir, lenin, led, bolsheviks, to, power, in, russia, the, world, s, first, socialist, state, was, founded, explicitly, along, marxist, lines, the, soviet, union, which, bolshevik, russia, would, become, a, part, of, was, a, one, party, state, under, the, rule, of, the, communist, party, of, the, soviet, union, cpsu, unlike, their, mass, based, counterparts, of, the, second, international, the, cpsu, and, other, leninist, parties, like, it, in, the, third, international, expected, their, members, to, know, the, classic, works, of, marx, engels, and, lenin, further, party, leaders, were, expected, to, base, their, policy, decisions, on, marxist, leninist, ideology, therefore, works, such, as, the, manifesto, were, required, reading, for, the, party, rank, and, file, therefore, the, widespread, dissemination, of, marx, and, engels, works, became, an, important, policy, objective, backed, by, a, sovereign, state, the, cpsu, had, relatively, inexhaustible, resources, for, this, purpose, works, by, marx, engels, and, lenin, were, published, on, a, very, large, scale, and, cheap, editions, of, their, works, were, available, in, several, languages, across, the, world, these, publications, were, either, shorter, writings, or, they, were, compendia, such, as, the, various, editions, of, marx, and, engels, selected, works, or, their, collected, works, this, affected, the, destiny, of, the, manifesto, in, several, ways, firstly, in, terms, of, circulation, in, 1932, the, american, and, british, communist, parties, printed, several, hundred, thousand, copies, of, a, cheap, edition, for, probably, the, largest, mass, edition, ever, issued, in, english, secondly, the, work, entered, political, science, syllabuses, in, universities, which, would, only, expand, after, the, second, world, war, for, its, centenary, in, 1948, its, publication, was, no, longer, the, exclusive, domain, of, marxists, and, academicians, general, publishers, too, printed, the, manifesto, in, large, numbers, in, short, it, was, no, longer, only, a, classic, marxist, document, hobsbawm, noted, it, had, become, a, political, classic, tout, court, total, sales, have, been, estimated, at, 500, million, and, one, of, the, four, best, selling, books, of, all, time, even, after, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, bloc, in, the, 1990s, the, communist, manifesto, remains, ubiquitous, hobsbawm, says, that, in, states, without, censorship, almost, certainly, anyone, within, reach, of, a, good, bookshop, and, certainly, anyone, within, reach, of, a, good, library, not, to, mention, the, internet, can, have, access, to, it, the, 150th, anniversary, once, again, brought, a, deluge, of, attention, in, the, press, and, the, academia, as, well, as, new, editions, of, the, book, fronted, by, introductions, to, the, text, by, academics, one, of, these, the, communist, manifesto, a, modern, edition, by, verso, was, touted, by, a, critic, in, the, london, review, of, books, as, being, a, stylish, red, ribboned, edition, of, the, work, it, is, designed, as, a, sweet, keepsake, an, exquisite, collector, s, item, in, manhattan, a, prominent, fifth, avenue, store, put, copies, of, this, choice, new, edition, in,

20th, and, 21st, century, writers, have, commented, on, the, communist, manifesto, s, continuing, relevance, in, a, special, issue, of, the, socialist, register, commemorating, the, manifesto, s, 150th, anniversary, peter, osborne, argued, that, it, was, the, single, most, influential, text, written, in, the, nineteenth, century, academic, john, raines, in, 2002, noted, in, our, day, this,

there, is, still, a, compulsive, quality, to, its, prose, as, it, provides, insight, after, insight, into, the, society, in, which, we, live, where, it, comes, from, and, where, it, s, going, to, it,

demonization, of, the, working, class, and, jason, barker, s, documentary, marx, reloaded, in, contrast, critics, such, as, revisionist, marxist, and, reformist, socialist, eduard, bernstein, distinguished, between, immature, early, marxism, as, exemplified, by, the, communist, manifesto, written, by, marx, and, engels, in, their, youth, that, he, opposed, for, its, violent, blanquist, tendencies, and, later, mature, marxism, that, he, supported, this, latter, form, refers, to, marx, in, his, later, life, seemingly, claiming, that, socialism, under, certain, circumstances, could, be, achieved, through, peaceful, means, through, legislative, reform, in, democratic, societies, bernstein, declared, that, the, massive, and, homogeneous, working, class, claimed, in, the, communist, manifesto, did, not, exist, and, that, contrary, to, claims, of, a, proletarian, majority, emerging, the, middle, class, was, growing, under, capitalism, and, not, disappearing, as, marx, had, claimed, marx, himself, later, in, his, life, acknowledged, that, the, petite, bourgeoisie, was, not, disappearing, in, his, work, theories, of, surplus, value, 1863, the, obscurity, of, the, later, work, means, that, marx, s, acknowledgement, of, this, error, is, not, well, known, george, boyer, described, the, manifesto, as, very, much, a, period, piece, a, document, of, what, was, called, the, hungry, 1840s, hal, draper, rejected, bernstein, s, arguments, about, the, middle, class, stating, that, the, manifesto, actually, notes, that, although, individual, members, of, this, class, are, being, constantly, proletarianized, the, class, limps, on, in, a, more, and, more, ruined, state, many, have, drawn, attention, to, the, passage, in, the, manifesto, that, seems, to, sneer, at, the, stupidity, of, the, rustic, the, bourgeoisie, draws, all, nations, into, civilisation, it, has, created, enormous, cities, and, thus, rescued, a, considerable, part, of, the, population, from, the, idiocy, of, rural, life, however, as, eric, hobsbawm, noted, hile, there, is, no, doubt, that, marx, at, this, time, shared, the, usual, townsman, s, contempt, for, as, well, as, ignorance, of, the, peasant, milieu, the, actual, and, analytically, more, interesting, german, phrase, dem, idiotismus, des, landlebens, entrissen, referred, not, to, stupidity, but, to, the, narrow, horizons, or, the, isolation, from, the, wider, society, in, which, people, in, the, countryside, lived, it, echoed, the, original, meaning, of, the, greek, term, idiotes, from, which, the, current, meaning, of, idiot, or, idiocy, is, derived, namely, a, person, concerned, only, with, his, own, private, affairs, and, not, with, those, of, the, wider, community, in, the, course, of, the, decades, since, the, 1840s, and, in, movements, whose, members, unlike, marx, were, not, classically, educated, the, original, sense, was, lost, and, was, misread, in, 2013, the, communist, manifesto, was, registered, to, unesco, s, memory, of, the, world, programme, along, with, marx, s, capital, volume, i, marx, and, engels, political, influences, were, wide, ranging, reacting, to, and, taking, inspiration, from, german, idealist, philosophy, french, socialism, and, english, and, scottish, political, economy, the, communist, manifesto, also, takes, influence, from, literature, in, jacques, derrida, s, work, specters, of, marx, the, state, of, the, debt, the, work, of, mourning, and, the, new, international, he, uses, william, shakespeare, s, hamlet, to, frame, a, discussion, of, the, history, of, the, international, showing, in, the, process, the, influence, that, shakespeare, s, work, had, on, marx, and, engels, writing, in, his, essay, big, leagues, specters, of, milton, and, republican, international, justice, between, shakespeare, and, marx, christopher, n, warren, makes, the, case, that, english, poet, john, milton, also, had, a, substantial, influence, on, marx, and, engels, work, historians, of, 19th, century, reading, habits, have, confirmed, that, marx, and, engels, would, have, read, these, authors, and, it, is, known, that, marx, loved, shakespeare, in, particular, milton, warren, argues, also, shows, a, notable, influence, on, the, communist, manifesto, saying, looking, back, on, milton, s, era, marx, saw, a, historical, dialectic, founded, on, inspiration, in, which, freedom, of, the, press, republicanism, and, revolution, were, closely, joined, milton, s, republicanism, warren, continues, served, as, a, useful, if, unlikely, bridge, as, marx, and, engels, sought, to, forge, a, revolutionary, international, coalition, the, manifesto, also, makes, reference, to, the, revolutionary, antibourgeois, social, criticism, of, thomas, carlyle, whom, engels, had, read, as, early, as, may, 1843
