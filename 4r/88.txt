children, s, literature, or, juvenile, literature, includes, stories, books, magazines, and, poems, that, are, created, for, children, modern, children, s, literature, is, classified, in, two, different, ways, genre, or, the, intended, age, of, the, reader, from, picture, books, for, the, very, young, to, young, adult, fiction, children, s, literature, can, be, traced, to, traditional, stories, like, fairy, tales, that, have, only, been, identified, as, children, s, literature, in, the, eighteenth, century, and, songs, part, of, a, wider, oral, tradition, that, adults, shared, with, children, before, publishing, existed, the, development, of, early, children, s, literature, before, printing, was, invented, is, difficult, to, trace, even, after, printing, became, widespread, many, classic, children, s, tales, were, originally, created, for, adults, and, later, adapted, for, a, younger, audience, since, the, fifteenth, century, much, literature, has, been, aimed, specifically, at, children, often, with, a, moral, or, religious, message, children, s, literature, has, been, shaped, by, religious, sources, like, puritan, traditions, or, by, more, philosophical, and, scientific, standpoints, with, the, influences, of, charles, darwin, and, john, locke, the, late, nineteenth, and, early, twentieth, centuries, are, known, as, the, golden, age, of, children, s, literature, because, many, classic, children, s, books, were, published, then, there, is, no, single, or, widely, used, definition, of, children, s, literature, 15, 17, it, can, be, broadly, defined, as, the, body, of, written, works, and, accompanying, illustrations, produced, in, order, to, entertain, or, instruct, young, people, the, genre, encompasses, a, wide, range, of, works, including, acknowledged, classics, of, world, literature, picture, books, and, easy, to, read, stories, written, exclusively, for, children, and, fairy, tales, lullabies, fables, folk, songs, and, other, primarily, orally, transmitted, materials, or, more, specifically, defined, as, fiction, non, fiction, poetry, or, drama, intended, for, and, used, by, children, and, young, people, xvii, one, writer, on, children, s, literature, defines, it, as, all, books, written, for, children, excluding, works, such, as, comic, books, joke, books, cartoon, books, and, non, fiction, works, that, are, not, intended, to, be, read, from, front, to, back, such, as, dictionaries, encyclopedias, and, other, reference, materials, however, others, would, argue, that, children, s, comics, should, also, be, included, children, s, literature, studies, has, traditionally, treated, comics, fitfully, and, superficially, despite, the, importance, of, comics, as, a, global, phenomenon, associated, with, children, the, international, companion, encyclopedia, of, children, s, literature, notes, that, the, boundaries, of, genre, are, not, fixed, but, blurred, 4, sometimes, no, agreement, can, be, reached, about, whether, a, given, work, is, best, categorized, as, literature, for, adults, or, children, some, works, defy, easy, categorization, j, k, rowling, s, harry, potter, series, was, written, and, marketed, for, children, but, it, is, also, popular, among, adults, the, series, extreme, popularity, led, the, new, york, times, to, create, a, separate, bestseller, list, for, children, s, books, despite, the, widespread, association, of, children, s, literature, with, picture, books, spoken, narratives, existed, before, printing, and, the, root, of, many, children, s, tales, go, back, to, ancient, storytellers, 30, seth, lerer, in, the, opening, of, children, s, literature, a, reader, s, history, from, aesop, to, harry, potter, says, this, book, presents, a, history, of, what, children, have, heard, and, read, the, history, i, write, of, is, a, history, of, reception, 2, early, children, s, literature, consisted, of, spoken, stories, songs, and, poems, used, to, educate, instruct, and, entertain, children, it, was, only, in, the, eighteenth, century, with, the, development, of, the, concept, of, childhood, that, a, separate, genre, of, children, s, literature, began, to, emerge, with, its, own, divisions, expectations, and, canon, x, xi, the, earliest, of, these, books, were, educational, books, books, on, conduct, and, simple, abcs, often, decorated, with, animals, plants, and, anthropomorphic, letters, in, 1962, french, historian, philippe, ari, s, argues, in, his, book, centuries, of, childhood, that, the, modern, concept, of, childhood, only, emerged, in, recent, times, he, explains, that, children, were, in, the, past, not, considered, as, greatly, different, from, adults, and, were, not, given, significantly, different, treatment, 5, as, evidence, for, this, position, he, notes, that, apart, from, instructional, and, didactic, texts, for, children, written, by, clerics, like, the, venerable, bede, and, lfric, of, eynsham, there, was, a, lack, of, any, genuine, literature, aimed, specifically, at, children, before, the, 18th, century, 11, other, scholars, have, qualified, this, viewpoint, by, noting, that, there, was, a, literature, designed, to, convey, the, values, attitudes, and, information, necessary, for, children, within, their, cultures, such, as, the, play, of, daniel, from, the, twelfth, century, 46, 4, pre, modern, children, s, literature, therefore, tended, to, be, of, a, didactic, and, moralistic, nature, with, the, purpose, of, conveying, conduct, related, educational, and, religious, lessons, 6, 8, during, the, seventeenth, century, the, concept, of, childhood, began, to, emerge, in, europe, adults, saw, children, as, separate, beings, innocent, and, in, need, of, protection, and, training, by, the, adults, around, them, 6, 7, 9, the, english, philosopher, john, locke, developed, his, theory, of, the, tabula, rasa, in, his, 1690, an, essay, concerning, human, understanding, in, locke, s, philosophy, tabula, rasa, was, the, theory, that, the, human, mind, is, at, birth, a, blank, slate, without, rules, for, processing, data, and, that, data, is, added, and, rules, for, processing, are, formed, solely, by, one, s, sensory, experiences, a, corollary, of, this, doctrine, was, that, the, mind, of, the, child, was, born, blank, and, that, it, was, the, duty, of, the, parents, to, imbue, the, child, with, correct, notions, locke, himself, emphasized, the, importance, of, providing, children, with, easy, pleasant, books, to, develop, their, minds, rather, than, using, force, to, compel, them, children, may, be, cozen, d, into, a, knowledge, of, the, letters, be, taught, to, read, without, perceiving, it, to, be, anything, but, a, sport, and, play, themselves, into, that, which, others, are, whipp, d, for, he, also, suggested, that, picture, books, be, created, for, children, in, the, nineteenth, century, a, few, children, s, titles, became, famous, as, classroom, reading, texts, among, these, were, the, fables, of, aesop, and, jean, de, la, fontaine, and, charles, perraults, s, 1697, tales, of, mother, goose, the, popularity, of, these, texts, led, to, the, creation, of, a, number, of, nineteenth, century, fantasy, and, fairy, tales, for, children, which, featured, magic, objects, and, talking, animals, another, influence, on, this, shift, in, attitudes, came, from, puritanism, which, stressed, the, importance, of, individual, salvation, puritans, were, concerned, with, the, spiritual, welfare, of, their, children, and, there, was, a, large, growth, in, the, publication, of, good, godly, books, aimed, squarely, at, children, some, of, the, most, popular, works, were, by, james, janeway, but, the, most, enduring, book, from, this, movement, still, read, today, especially, in, modernised, versions, is, the, pilgrim, s, progress, 1678, by, john, bunyan, chapbooks, pocket, sized, pamphlets, that, were, often, folded, instead, of, being, stitched, 32, were, published, in, britain, illustrated, by, woodblock, printing, these, inexpensive, booklets, reprinted, popular, ballads, historical, re, tellings, and, folk, tales, though, not, specifically, published, for, children, at, this, time, young, people, enjoyed, the, booklets, as, well, 8, johanna, bradley, says, in, from, chapbooks, to, plum, cake, that, chapbooks, kept, imaginative, stories, from, being, lost, to, readers, under, the, strict, puritan, influence, of, the, time, 17, hornbooks, also, appeared, in, england, during, this, time, teaching,

class, and, the, influence, of, lockean, theories, of, childhood, innocence, combined, to, create, the, beginnings, of, childhood, as, a, concept, in, an, article, for, the, british, library, professor, mo, grenby, writes, in, the, 1740s, a, cluster, of, london, publishers, began, to, produce, new, books, designed, to, instruct, and, delight, young, readers, thomas, boreman, was, one, another, was, mary, cooper, whose, two, volume, tommy, thumb, s, pretty, song, book, 1744, is, the, first, known, nursery, rhyme, collection, but, the, most, celebrated, of, these, pioneers, is, john, newbery, whose, first, book, for, the, entertainment, of, children, was, a, little, pretty, pocket, book, widely, considered, the, first, modern, children, s, book, a, little, pretty, pocket, book, was, the, first, children, s, publication, aimed, at, giving, enjoyment, to, children, containing, a, mixture, of, rhymes, picture, stories, and, games, for, pleasure, newbery, believed, that, play, was, a, better, enticement, to, children, s, good, behavior, than, physical, discipline, and, the, child, was, to, record, his, or, her, behaviour, daily, the, book, was, child, sized, with, a, brightly, colored, cover, that, appealed, to, children, something, new, in, the, publishing, industry, known, as, gift, books, these, early, books, became, the, precursors, to, the, toy, books, popular, in, the, nineteenth, century, newbery, was, also, adept, at, marketing, this, new, genre, according, to, the, journal, the, lion, and, the, unicorn, newbery, s, genius, was, in, developing, the, fairly, new, product, category, children, s, books, through, his, frequent, advertisements, and, his, clever, ploy, of, introducing, additional, titles, and, products, into, the, body, of, his, children, s, books, professor, grenby, writes, newbery, has, become, known, as, the, father, of, children, s, literature, chiefly, because, he, was, able, to, show, that, publishing, children, s, books, could, be, a, commercial, success, the, improvement, in, the, quality, of, books, for, children, and, the, diversity, of, topics, he, published, helped, make, newbery, the, leading, producer, of, children, s, books, in, his, time, he, published, his, own, books, as, well, as, those, by, authors, such, as, samuel, johnson, and, oliver, goldsmith, 36, the, latter, may, have, written, the, history, of, little, goody, two, shoes, newbery, s, most, popular, book, another, philosopher, who, influenced, the, development, of, children, s, literature, was, jean, jacques, rousseau, who, argued, that, children, should, be, allowed, to, develop, naturally, and, joyously, his, idea, of, appealing, to, a, children, s, natural, interests, took, hold, among, writers, for, children, 41, popular, examples, included, thomas, day, s, the, history, of, sandford, and, merton, four, volumes, that, embody, rousseau, s, theories, furthermore, maria, and, richard, lovell, edgeworth, s, practical, education, the, history, of, harry, and, lucy, 1780, urged, children, to, teach, themselves, rousseau, s, ideas, also, had, great, influence, in, germany, especially, on, german, philanthropism, a, movement, concerned, with, reforming, both, education, and, literature, for, children, its, founder, johann, bernhard, basedow, authored, elementarwerk, as, a, popular, textbook, for, children, that, included, many, illustrations, by, daniel, chodowiecki, another, follower, joachim, heinrich, campe, created, an, adaptation, of, robinson, crusoe, that, went, into, over, 100, printings, he, became, germany, s, outstanding, and, most, modern, 736, writer, for, children, according, to, hans, heino, ewers, in, the, international, companion, encyclopedia, of, children, s, literature, it, can, be, argued, that, from, this, time, the, history, of, european, children, s, literature, was, largely, written, in, germany, 737, the, brothers, grimm, preserved, and, published, the, traditional, tales, told, in, germany, 184, they, were, so, popular, in, their, home, country, that, modern, realistic, children, s, literature, began, to, be, looked, down, on, there, this, dislike, of, non, traditional, stories, continued, there, until, the, beginning, of, the, next, century, 739, 740, in, addition, to, their, collection, of, stories, the, grimm, brothers, also, contributed, to, children, s, literature, through, their, academic, pursuits, as, professors, they, had, a, scholarly, interest, in, the, stories, striving, to, preserve, them, and, their, variations, accurately, recording, their, sources, 259, a, similar, project, was, carried, out, by, the, norwegian, scholars, peter, christen, asbj, rnsen, and, j, rgen, moe, who, collected, norwegian, fairy, tales, and, published, them, as, norwegian, folktales, often, referred, to, as, asbj, rnsen, and, moe, by, compiling, these, stories, they, preserved, norway, s, literary, heritage, and, helped, create, the, norwegian, written, language, 260, danish, author, and, poet, hans, christian, andersen, traveled, through, europe, and, gathered, many, well, known, fairy, tales, and, created, new,

to, introduce, bizarre, odd, and, grotesque, elements, in, children, s, literature, and, thereby, anticipates, lewis, carroll, s, tale, alice, s, adventures, in, wonderland, there, are, not, only, parallels, concerning, the, content, the, weird, adventures, of, a, young, girl, in, a, fantasy, land, but, also, the, origin, of, the, tales, as, both, are, dedicated, and, given, to, a, daughter, of, the, author, s, friends, the, shift, to, a, modern, genre, of, children, s, literature, occurred, in, the, mid, 19th, century, didacticism, of, a, previous, age, began, to, make, way, for, more, humorous, child, oriented, books, more, attuned, to, the, child, s, imagination, the, availability, of, children, s, literature, greatly, increased, as, well, as, paper, and, printing, became, widely,

change, in, writing, style, for, children, to, an, imaginative, and, empathetic, one, regarded, as, the, first, english, masterpiece, written, for, children, 44, and, as, a, founding, book, in, the,

disciplinary, fields, literary, studies, cultural, studies, literature, and, language, departments, and, humanities, library, and, information, science, and, education, wolf, et, al, 2011, typically, children, s, literature, scholars, from, literature, departments, in, universities, english, german, spanish, etc, departments, cultural, studies, or, in, the, humanities, conduct, literary, analysis, of, books, this, literary, criticism, may, focus, on, an, author, a, thematic, or, topical, concern, genre, period, or, literary, device, and, may, address, issues, from, a, variety, of, critical, stances, poststructural, postcolonial, new, criticism, psychoanalytic, new, historicism, etc, results, of, this, type, of, research, are, typically, published, as, books, or, as, articles, in, scholarly, journals, the, field, of, library, and, information, science, has, a, long, history, of, conducting, research, related, to, children, s, literature, most, educational, researchers, studying, children, s, literature, explore, issues, related, to, the, use, of, children, s, literature, in, classroom, settings, they, may, also, study, topics, such, as, home, use, children, s, out, of, school, reading, or, parents, use, of, children, s, books, teachers, typically, use, children, s, literature, to, augment, classroom, instruction, translation, of, children, s, literature, can, emerge, in, various, forms, and, necessitates, to, have, a, comprehension, of, the, children, s, inner, worlds, and, developmental, factors, hollindale, in, 1997, takes, the, attention, on, the, experimental, dynamic, imaginative, interactive, and, unstable, nature, of, childness, considering, that, the, translation, is, carried, out, for, children, consequently, requires, to, the, necessities, of, the, youngest, readers, and, thus, the, target, text, can, be, expected, to, involve, considering, effective, content, creativity, the, simplest, of, expression, and, linguistic, playfulness, beyond, age, considerations, in, the, translation, of, children, s, literature, the, translators, are, supposed, to, comprehend, the, changing, status, and, essence, of, youth, cultures, this, arises, from, the, phenomena, that, works, translated, for, children, can, be, fictions, fundamentally, produced, both, for, adults, and, children, consisting, of, genres, such, as, romances, fables, and, fairytales, besides, adults, might, be, present, in, literary, works, for, children, as, the, disguise, of, a, didactic, narrator, or, ironic, asides, this, can, have, the, power, to, change, the, implicit, adult, child, relationship, in, the, source, text, the, visuals, play, an, important, role, in, children, s, literature, for, younger, audience, and, these, visuals, might, consist, of, comics, graphic, novels, and, picture, books, therefore, the, translators, are, required, to, have, an, understanding, of, typography, visual, coding, and, stylization, accordingly, comprehending, the, multi, medial, nature, of, children, s, literature, and, grasping, how, to, compose, text, and, images, for, promoting, active, child, readers, are, fundamental, for, translators, to, produce, effective, target, texts, scholars, such, as, oittinen, suggests, that, translators, of, children, s, literature, would, benefit, from, having, a, specialized, training, in, arts, along, with, translation, studies, puurtinen, and, kreller, highlights, other, aspects, such, as, of, sound, narrative, structure, syntactic, alterations, and, textual, elements, like, repetition, and, rhyme, and, they, suggest, these, components, possess, crucial, roles, in, translating, children, s, literature, it, can, be, said, that, these, suggestions, are, being, further, on, through, critical, developments, such, as, edited, volumes, reviews, and, collections, in, the, field, opening, the, path, for, future, research, directions, the, us, reported, revenue, of, us, 4, 7, billion, from, children, s, books, in, 2020, followed, by, germany, us, 2, billion, the, uk, us, 508, million, spain, us, 427, million, and, france, us, 406, million, controversies, often, emerge, around, the, content, and, characters, of, prominent, children, s, books, well, known, classics, that, remain, popular, throughout, decades, commonly, become, criticized, by, critics, and, readers, as, the, values, of, contemporary, culture, change, critical, analysis, of, children, s, literature, is, common, through, children, s, literary, journals, as, well, as, published, collections, of, essays, contributed, to, by, psychoanalysts, scholars, and, various, literary, critics, such, as, peter, hunt, a, widely, discussed, and, debated, topic, by, critics, and, publishers, in, the, children, s, book, industry, is, whether, outdated, and, offensive, content, specifically, racial, stereotypes, should, be, changed, in, new, editions, others, argue, instead, that, original, content, should, remain, but, that, publishers, should, add, information, to, guide, parents, in, conversations, with, their, children, about, the, problematic, elements, of, the, particular, story, some, see, racist, stereotypes, as, cultural, artifacts, that, should, be, preserved, in, the, children, s, culture, reader, scholar, henry, jenkins, references, herbert, r, kohl, s, essay, should, we, burn, babar, which, raises, the, debate, whether, children, should, be, educated, on, how, to, think, critically, towards, oppressive, ideologies, rather, than, ignore, historical, mistakes, jenkins, suggests, that, parents, and, educators, should, trust, children, to, make, responsible, judgments, some, books, have, been, altered, in, newer, editions, and, significant, changes, can, be, seen, such, as, illustrator, richard, scarry, s, book, best, word, book, ever, and, roald, dahl, s, book, charlie, and, the, chocolate, factory, in, other, cases, classics, have, been, rewritten, into, updated,

was, a, simple, technique, in, deceiving, those, who, only, relied, on, stories, and, secondary, resources, resulting, in, a, new, age, of, books, which, put, a, gloss, on, imperialism, and, its, teachings, at, the, time, thus, encouraging, the, idea, that, the, colonies, who, were, part, of, the, african, continent, were, perceived, as, animals, savages, and, inhuman, like, therefore,
