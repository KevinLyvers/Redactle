this, section, is, told, from, an, omniscient, point, of, view, and, occasionally, from, mrs, mcnab, s, point, of, view, mrs, mcnab, worked, in, the, ramsays, house, from, the, beginning, and, provides, a, view, of, how, things, have, changed, while, the, summer, home, has, been, unoccupied, in, this, final, section, some, of, the, remaining, ramsays, and, other, guests, return, to, their, summer, home, ten, years, after, the, events, of, part, i, mr, ramsay, plans, to, make, the, long, delayed, visit, to, the, lighthouse, with, his, daughter, cam, illa, and, his, son, james, his, other, four, surviving, children, are, virtually, unmentioned, in, the, final, section, the, visit, almost, does, not, happen, as, cam, and, james, are, not, ready, but, they, eventually, set, off, as, they, travel, the, children, are, silent, in, protest, at, their, father, for, forcing, them, to, come, along, however, james, keeps, the, sailing, boat, steady, and, rather, than, receiving, the, harsh, words, he, has, come, to, expect, from, his, father, he, hears, praise, providing, a, rare, moment, of, empathy, between, father, and, son, cam, s, attitude, towards, her, father, changes, from, resentment, to, eventual, admiration, they, are, accompanied, by, the, sailor, macalister, and, his, son, who, catches, fish, during, the, journey, while, they, set, sail, for, the, lighthouse, lily, attempts, to, complete, the, painting, she, has, held, in, her, mind, since, the, start, of, the, novel, she, reconsiders, her, memories, of, mrs, and, mr, ramsay, balancing, the, multitude, of, impressions, from, ten, years, ago, in, an, effort, to, reach, the, objective, truth, about, mrs, ramsay, and, about, life, itself, upon, finishing, the, painting, just, as, the, sailing, party, reaches, the, lighthouse, and, seeing, that, it, satisfies, her, she, realises, that, the, execution, of, her, vision, is, more, important, to, her, than, the, idea, of, leaving, some, sort, of, legacy, large, parts, of, woolf, s, novel, do, not, concern, themselves, with, the, objects, of, vision, but, rather, investigate, the, means, of, perception, attempting, to, understand, people, in, the, act, of, looking, to, be, able, to, understand, thought, woolf, s, diaries, reveal, that, the, author, would, spend, considerable, time, listening, to, herself, think, observing, how, and, which, words, and, emotions, arose, in, her, own, mind, in, response, to, what, she, saw, this, examination, of, perception, is, not, however, limited, to, isolated, inner, dialogues, but, also, analysed, in, the, context, of, human, relationships, and, the, tumultuous, emotional, spaces, crossed, to, truly, reach, another, human, being, two, sections, of, the, book, stand, out, as, excellent, snapshots, of, fumbling, attempts, at, this, crossing, the, silent, interchange, between, mr, and, mrs, ramsay, as, they, pass, the, time, alone, together, at, the, end, of, section, 1, and, lily, briscoe, s, struggle, to, fulfill, mr, ramsay, s, desire, for, sympathy, and, attention, as, the, novel, closes, the, novel, maintains, an, unusual, form, of, omniscient, narrator, the, plot, unfolds, through, shifting, perspectives, of, each, character, s, consciousness, shifts, can, occur, even, mid, sentence, and, in, some, sense, they, resemble, the, rotating, beam, of, the, lighthouse, itself, unlike, james, joyce, s, stream, of, consciousness, technique, however, woolf, does, not, tend, to, use, abrupt, fragments, to, represent, characters, thought, processes, her, method, is, more, one, of, lyrical, paraphrases, the, unique, presentation, of, omniscient, narration, means, that, throughout, the, novel, readers, are, challenged, to, formulate, their, own, understanding, and, views, from, the, subtle, shifts, in, character, development, as, much, of, the, story, is, presented, in, ambiguous, or, even, contradictory, descriptions, whereas, in, part, i, the, novel, is, concerned, with, illustrating, the, relationship, between, the, character, s, experiences, and, the, actual, experience, and, surroundings, part, ii, time, passes, having, no, characters, to, relate, to, presents, events, differently, instead, woolf, wrote, the, section, from, the, perspective, of, a, displaced, narrator, unrelated, to, any, people, intending, that, events, be, seen, in, relation, to, time, for, that, reason, the, narrating, voice, is, unfocused, and, distorted, providing, an, example, of, what, woolf, called, life, as, it, is, when, we, have, no, part, in, it, major, events, like, deaths, of, mrs, ramsay, prue, andrew, are, related, parenthetically, which, makes, the, narration, a, kind, of, journal, entry, it, is, also, possible, that, the, house, itself, is, the, inanimate, narrator, of, these, events, woolf, began, writing, to, the, lighthouse, partly, as, a, way, of, understanding, and, dealing, with, unresolved, issues, concerning, both, her, parents, and, indeed, there, are, many, similarities, between, the, plot, and, her, own, life, her, visits, with, her, parents, and, family, to, st, ives, cornwall, where, her, father, rented, a, house, were, perhaps, the, happiest, times, of, woolf, s, life, but, when, she, was, thirteen, her, mother, died, and, like, mr, ramsay, her, father, leslie, stephen, plunged, into, gloom, and, self, pity, woolf, s, sister, vanessa, bell, wrote, that, reading, the, sections, of, the, novel, that, describe, mrs, ramsay, was, like, seeing, her, mother, raised, from, the, dead, their, brother, adrian, was, not, allowed, to, go, on, an, expedition, to, godrevy, lighthouse, just, as, in, the, novel, james, looks, forward, to, visiting, the, lighthouse, and, is, disappointed, when, the, trip, is, cancelled, lily, briscoe, s, meditations, on, painting, are, a, way, for, woolf, to, explore, her, own, creative, process, and, also, that, of, her, painter, sister, since, woolf, thought, of, writing, in, the, same, way, that, lily, thought, of, painting, woolf, s, father, began, renting, talland, house, in, st, ives, in, 1882, shortly, after, woolf, s, birth, the, house, was, used, by, the, family, as, a, family, retreat, during, the, summer, for, the, next, ten, years, the, location, of, the, main, story, in, to, the, lighthouse, the, house, on, the, hebridean, island, was, formed, by, woolf, in, imitation, of, talland, house, many, actual, features, from, st, ives, bay, are, carried, into, the, story, including, the, gardens, leading, down, to, the, sea, the, sea, itself, and, the, lighthouse, although, in, the, novel, the, ramsays, return, to, the, house, on, skye, after, the, war, the, stephens, had, given, up, talland, house, by, that, time, after, the, war, virginia, woolf, visited, talland, house, under, its, new, ownership, with, her, sister, vanessa, and, woolf, repeated, the, journey, later, long, after, her, parents, were, dead, upon, completing, the, draft, of, this, her, most, autobiographical, novel, woolf, described, it, as, easily, the, best, of, my, books, and, her, husband, leonard, thought, it, a, masterpiece, entirely, new, a, psychological, poem, they, published, it, together, at, their, hogarth, press, in, london, in, 1927, the, first, impression, of, 3000, copies, of, 320, pages, measuring, 7, 1, 2, by, 5, inches, 191, by, 127, mm, was, bound, in, blue, cloth, the, book, outsold, all, woolf, s, previous, novels, and, the, royalties, enabled, the, woolfs, to, buy, a, car
