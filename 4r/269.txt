of, intellectuals, in, london, and, unconnected, to, oxford, university, 103, 104, 112, richard, chenevix, trench, herbert, coleridge, and, frederick, furnivall, who, were, dissatisfied, with, the, existing, english, dictionaries, the, society, expressed, interest, in, compiling, a, new, dictionary, as, early, as, 1844, but, it, was, not, until, june, 1857, that, they, began, by, forming, an, unregistered, words, committee, to, search, for, words, that, were, unlisted, or, poorly, defined, in, current, dictionaries, in, november, trench, s, report, was, not, a, list, of, unregistered, words, instead, it, was, the, study, on, some, deficiencies, in, our, english, dictionaries, which, identified, seven, distinct, shortcomings, in, contemporary, dictionaries, the, society, ultimately, realized, that, the, number, of, unlisted, words, would, be, far, more, than, the, number, of, words, in, the, english, dictionaries, of, the, 19th, century, and, shifted, their, idea, from, covering, only, words, that, were, not, already, in, english, dictionaries, to, a, larger, project, trench, suggested, that, a, new, truly, comprehensive, dictionary, was, needed, on, 7, january, 1858, the, society, formally, adopted, the, idea, of, a, comprehensive, new, dictionary, 107, 108, volunteer, readers, would, be, assigned, particular, books, copying, passages, illustrating, word, usage, onto, quotation, slips, later, the, same, year, the, society, agreed, to, the, project, in, principle, with, the, title, a, new, english, dictionary, on, historical, principles, ned, ix, x, richard, chenevix, trench, 1807, 1886, played, the, key, role, in, the, project, s, first, months, but, his, appointment, as, dean, of, westminster, meant, that, he, could, not, give, the, dictionary, project, the, time, that, it, required, he, withdrew, and, herbert, coleridge, became, the, first, editor, 8, 9, on, 12, may, 1860, coleridge, s, dictionary, plan, was, published, and, research, was, started, his, house, was, the, first, editorial, office, he, arrayed, 100, 000, quotation, slips, in, a, 54, pigeon, hole, grid, 9, in, april, 1861, the, group, published, the, first, sample, pages, later, that, month, coleridge, died, of, tuberculosis, aged, 30, x, thereupon, furnivall, became, editor, he, was, enthusiastic, and, knowledgeable, but, temperamentally, ill, suited, for, the, work, 110, many, volunteer, readers, eventually, lost, interest, in, the, project, as, furnivall, failed, to, keep, them, motivated, furthermore, many, of, the, slips, were, misplaced, furnivall, believed, that, since, many, printed, texts, from, earlier, centuries, were, not, readily, available, it, would, be, impossible, for, volunteers, to, efficiently, locate, the, quotations, that, the, dictionary, needed, as, a, result, he, founded, the, early, english, text, society, in, 1864, and, the, chaucer, society, in, 1868, to, publish, old, manuscripts, xii, furnivall, s, preparatory, efforts, lasted, 21, years, and, provided, numerous, texts, for, the, use, and, enjoyment, of, the, general, public, as, well, as, crucial, sources, for, lexicographers, but, they, did, not, actually, involve, compiling, a, dictionary, furnivall, recruited, more, than, 800, volunteers, to, read, these, texts, and, record, quotations, while, enthusiastic, the, volunteers, were, not, well, trained, and, often, made, inconsistent, and, arbitrary, selections, ultimately, furnivall, handed, over, nearly, two, tons, of, quotation, slips, and, other, materials, to, his, successor, in, the, 1870s, furnivall, unsuccessfully, attempted, to, recruit, both, henry, sweet, and, henry, nicol, to, succeed, him, he, then, approached, james, murray, who, accepted, the, post, of, editor, in, the, late, 1870s, furnivall, and, murray, met, with, several, publishers, about, publishing, the, dictionary, in, 1878, oxford, university, press, agreed, with, murray, to, proceed, with, the, massive, project, the, agreement, was, formalized, the, following, year, 111, 112, 20, years, after, its, conception, the, dictionary, project, finally, had, a, publisher, it, would, take, another, 50, years, to, complete, late, in, his, editorship, murray, learned, that, one, especially, prolific, reader, w, c, minor, was, confined, to, a, mental, hospital, for, in, modern, terminology, schizophrenia, xiii, minor, was, a, yale, university, trained, surgeon, and, a, military, officer, in, the, american, civil, war, who, had, been, confined, to, broadmoor, asylum, for, the, criminally, insane, after, killing, a, man, in, london, he, invented, his, own, quotation, tracking, system, allowing, him, to, submit, slips, on, specific, words, in, response, to, editors, requests, the, story, of, how, murray, and, minor, worked, together, to, advance, the, oed, was, retold, in, the, 1998, book, the, surgeon, of, crowthorne, us, title, the, professor, and, the, madman, which, was, the, basis, for, a, 2019, film, the, professor, and, the, madman, starring, mel, gibson, and, sean, penn, during, the, 1870s, the, philological, society, was, concerned, with, the, process, of, publishing, a, dictionary, with, such, an, immense, scope, they, had, pages, printed, by, publishers, but, no, publication, agreement, was, reached, both, the, cambridge, university, press, and, the, oxford, university, press, were, approached, the, oup, finally, agreed, in, 1879, after, two, years, of, negotiating, by, sweet, furnivall, and, murray, to, publish, the, dictionary, and, to, pay, murray, who, was, both, the, editor, and, the, philological, society, president, the, dictionary, was, to, be, published, as, interval, fascicles, with, the, final, form, in, four, volumes, totalling, 6, 400, pages, they, hoped, to, finish, the, project, in, ten, years, 1, murray, started, the, project, working, in, a, corrugated, iron, outbuilding, called, the, scriptorium, which, was, lined, with, wooden, planks, bookshelves, and, 1, 029, pigeon, holes, for, the, quotation, slips, xiii, he, tracked, and, regathered, furnivall, s, collection, of, quotation, slips, which, were, found, to, concentrate, on, rare, interesting, words, rather, than, common, usages, for, instance, there, were, ten, times, as, many, quotations, for, abusion, as, for, abuse, he, appealed, through, newspapers, distributed, to, bookshops, and, libraries, for, readers, who, would, report, as, many, quotations, as, you, can, for, ordinary, words, and, for, words, that, were, rare, obsolete, old, fashioned, new, peculiar, or, used, in, a, peculiar, way, murray, had, american, philologist, and, liberal, arts, college, professor, francis, march, manage, the, collection, in, north, america, 1, 000, quotation, slips, arrived, daily, to, the, scriptorium, and, by, 1880, there, were, 2, 500, 000, 15, the, first, dictionary, fascicle, was, published, on, 1, february, 1884, twenty, three, years, after, coleridge, s, sample, pages, the, full, title, was, a, new, english, dictionary, on, historical, principles, founded, mainly, on, the, materials, collected, by, the, philological, society, the, 352, page, volume, words, from, a, to, ant, cost, 12, s, 6, d, 251, equivalent, to, 82, in, 2023, the, total, sales, were, only, 4, 000, copies, 169, the, oup, saw, that, it, would, take, too, long, to, complete, the, work, with, unrevised, editorial, arrangements, accordingly, new, assistants, were, hired, and, two, new, demands, were, made, on, murray, 32, 33, the, first, was, that, he, move, from, mill, hill, to, oxford, to, work, full, time, on, the, project, which, he, did, in, 1885, murray, had, his, scriptorium, re, erected, in, the, back, garden, of, his, new, property, xvii, murray, resisted, the, second, demand, that, if, he, could, not, meet, schedule, he, must, hire, a, second, senior, editor, to, work, in, parallel, to, him, outside, his, supervision, on, words, from, elsewhere, in, the, alphabet, murray, did, not, want, to, share, the, work, feeling, that, he, would, accelerate, his, work, pace, with, experience, that, turned, out, not, to, be, so, and, philip, gell, of, the, oup, forced, the, promotion, of, murray, s, assistant, henry, bradley, hired, by, murray, in, 1884, who, worked, independently, in, the, british, museum, in, london, beginning, in, 1888, in, 1896, bradley, moved, to, oxford, university, gell, continued, harassing, murray, and, bradley, with, his, business, concerns, containing, costs, and, speeding, production, to, the, point, where, the, project, s, collapse, seemed, likely, newspapers, reported, the, harassment, particularly, the, saturday, review, and, public, opinion, backed, the, editors, 182, 83, gell, was, fired, and, the, university, reversed, his, cost, policies, if, the, editors, felt, that, the, dictionary, would, have, to, grow, larger, it, would, it, was, an, important, work, and, worth, the, time, and, money, to, properly, finish, neither, murray, nor, bradley, lived, to, see, it, murray, died, in, 1915, having, been, responsible, for, words, starting, with, a, d, h, k, o, p, and, t, nearly, half, the, finished, dictionary, bradley, died, in, 1923, having, completed, e, g, l, m, s, sh, st, and, w, we, by, then, two, additional, editors, had, been, promoted, from, assistant, work, to, independent, work, continuing, without, much, trouble, william, craigie, started, in, 1901, and, was, responsible, for, n, q, r, si, sq, u, v, and, wo, wy, xix, the, oup, had, previously, thought, london, too, far, from, oxford, but, after, 1925, craigie, worked, on, the, dictionary, in, chicago, where, he, was, a, professor, xix, the, fourth, editor, was, charles, talbut, onions, who, compiled, the, remaining, ranges, starting, in, 1914, su, sz, wh, wo, and, x, z, in, 1919, 1920, j, r, r, tolkien, was, employed, by, the, oed, researching, etymologies, of, the, waggle, to, warlock,

published, or, about, one, per, year, four, for, a, b, five, for, c, and, two, for, e, of, these, eight, were, 352, pages, long, while, the, last, one, in, each, group, was, shorter, to, end, at, the, letter, break, which, eventually, became, a, volume, break, at, this, point, it, was, decided, to, publish, the, work, in, smaller, and, more, frequent, instalments, once, every, three, months, beginning, in, 1895, there, would, be, a, fascicle, of, 64, pages, priced, at, 2s, 6d, if, enough, material, was, ready, 128, or, even, 192, pages, would, be, published, together, this, pace, was, maintained, until, world, war, i, forced, reductions, in, staff, xx, each, time, enough, consecutive, pages, were, available, the, same, material, was, also, published, in, the, original, larger, fascicles, xx, also, in, 1895, the, title, oxford, english, dictionary, was, first, used, it, then, appeared, only, on, the, outer, covers, of, the, fascicles, the, original, title, was, still, the, official, one, and, was, used, everywhere, else, xx, the, 125th, and, last, fascicle, covered, words, from, wise, to, the, end, of, w, and, was, published, on, 19, april, 1928, and, the, full, dictionary, in, bound, volumes, followed, immediately, xx, william, shakespeare, is, the, most, quoted, writer, in, the, completed, dictionary, with, hamlet, his, most, quoted, work, george, eliot, mary, ann, evans, is, the, most, quoted, female, writer, collectively, the, bible, is, the, most, quoted, work, in, many, translations, the, most, quoted, single, work, is, cursor, mundi, additional, material, for, a, given, letter, range, continued, to, be, gathered, after, the, corresponding, fascicle, was, printed, with, a, view, towards, inclusion, in, a, supplement, or, revised, edition, a, one, volume, supplement, of, such, material, was, published, in, 1933, with, entries, weighted, towards, the, start, of, the, alphabet, where, the, fascicles, were, decades, old, the, supplement, included, at, least, one, word, bondmaid, accidentally, omitted, when, its, slips, were, misplaced, many, words, and, senses, newly, coined, famously, appendicitis, coined, in, 1886, and, missing, from, the, 1885, fascicle, which, came, to, prominence, when, edward, vii, s, 1902, appendicitis, postponed, his, coronation, and, some, previously, excluded, as, too, obscure, notoriously, radium, omitted, in, 1903, months, before, its, discoverers, pierre, and, marie, curie, won, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, also, in, 1933, the, original, fascicles, of, the, entire, dictionary, were, re, issued, bound, into, 12, volumes, under, the, title, the, oxford, english, dictionary, this, edition, of, 13, volumes, including, the, supplement, was, subsequently, reprinted, in, 1961, and, 1970, in, 1933, oxford, had, finally, put, the, dictionary, to, rest, all, work, ended, and, the, quotation, slips, went, into, storage, however, the, english, language, continued, to, change, and, by, the, time, 20, years, had, passed, the, dictionary, was, outdated, there, were, three, possible, ways, to, update, it, the, cheapest, would, have, been, to, leave, the, existing, work, alone, and, simply, compile, a, new, supplement, of, perhaps, one, or, two, volumes, but, then, anyone, looking, for, a, word, or, sense, and, unsure, of, its, age, would, have, to, look, in, three, different, places, the, most, convenient, choice, for, the, user, would, have, been, for, the, entire, dictionary, to, be, re, edited, and, retypeset, with, each, change, included, in, its, proper, alphabetical, place, but, this, would, have, been, the, most, expensive, option, with, perhaps, 15, volumes, required, to, be, produced, the, oup, chose, a, middle, approach, combining, the, new, material, with, the, existing, supplement, to, form, a, larger, replacement, supplement, robert, burchfield, was, hired, in, 1957, to, edit, the, second, supplement, charles, talbut, onions, turned, 84, that, year, but, was, still, able, to, make, some, contributions, as, well, the, work, on, the, supplement, was, expected, to, take, about, seven, years, it, actually, took, 29, years, by, which, time, the, new, supplement, oeds, had, grown, to, four, volumes, starting, with, a, h, o, and, sea, they, were, published, in, 1972, 1976, 1982, and, 1986, respectively, bringing, the, complete, dictionary, to, 16, volumes, or, 17, counting, the, first, supplement, burchfield, emphasized, the, inclusion, of, modern, day, language, and, through, the, supplement, the, dictionary, was, expanded, to, include, a, wealth, of, new, words, from, the, burgeoning, fields, of, science, and, technology, as, well, as, popular, culture, and, colloquial, speech, burchfield, said, that, he, broadened, the, scope, to, include, developments, of, the, language, in, english, speaking, regions, beyond, the, united, kingdom, including, north, america, australia, new, zealand, south, africa, india, pakistan, and, the, caribbean, burchfield, also, removed, for, unknown, reasons, many, entries, that, had, been, added, to, the, 1933, supplement, in, 2012, an, analysis, by, lexicographer, sarah, ogilvie, revealed, that, many, of, these, entries, were, in, fact, foreign, loanwords, despite, burchfield, s, claim, that, he, included, more, such, words, the, proportion, was, estimated, from, a, sample, calculation, to, amount, to, 17, of, the, foreign, loan, words, and, words, from, regional, forms, of, english, some, of, these, had, only, a, single, recorded, usage, but, many, had, multiple, recorded, citations, and, it, ran, against, what, was, thought, to, be, the, established, oed, editorial, practice, and, a, perception, that, he, had, opened, up, the, dictionary, to, world, english, by, the, time, the, new, supplement, was, completed, it, was, clear, that, the, full, text, of, the, dictionary, would, need, to, be, computerized, achieving, this, would, require, retyping, it, once, but, thereafter, it, would, always, be, accessible, for, computer, searching, as, well, as, for, whatever, new, editions, of, the, dictionary, might, be, desired, starting, with, an, integration, of, the, supplementary, volumes, and, the, main, text, preparation, for, this, process, began, in, 1983, and, editorial, work, started, the, following, year, under, the, administrative, direction, of, timothy, j, benbow, with, john, a, simpson, and, edmund, s, c, weiner, as, co, editors, in, 2016, simpson, published, his, memoir, chronicling, his, years, at, the, oed, the, word, detective, searching, for, the, meaning, of, it, all, at, the, oxford, english, dictionary, a, memoir, new, york, basic, books, thus, began, the, new, oxford, english, dictionary, noed, project, in, the, united, states, more, than, 120, typists, of, the, international, computaprint, corporation, now, reed, tech, started, keying, in, over, 350, 000, 000, characters, their, work, checked, by, 55, proof, readers, in, england, retyping, the, text, alone, was, not, sufficient, all, the, information, represented, by, the, complex, typography, of, the, original, dictionary, had, to, be, retained, which, was, done, by, marking, up, the, content, in, sgml, a, specialized, search, engine, and, display, software, were, also, needed, to, access, it, under, a, 1985, agreement, some, of, this, software, work, was, done, at, the, university, of, waterloo, canada, at, the, centre, for, the, new, oxford, english, dictionary, led, by, frank, tompa, and, gaston, gonnet, this, search, technology, went, on, to, become, the, basis, for, the, open, text, corporation, computer, hardware, database, and, other, software, development, managers, and, programmers, for, the, project, were, donated, by, the, british, subsidiary, of, ibm, the, colour, syntax, directed, editor, for, the, project, lexx, was, written, by, mike, cowlishaw, of, ibm, the, university, of, waterloo, in, canada, volunteered, to, design, the, database, a, walton, litz, an, english, professor, at, princeton, university, who, served, on, the, oxford, university, press, advisory, council, was, quoted, in, time, as, saying, i, ve, never, been, associated, with, a, project, i, ve, never, even, heard, of, a, project, that, was, so, incredibly, complicated, and, that, met, every, deadline, by, 1989, the, noed, project, had, achieved, its, primary, goals, and, the, editors, working, online, had, successfully, combined, the, original, text, burchfield, s, supplement, and, a, small, amount, of, newer, material, into, a, single, unified, dictionary, the, word, new, was, again, dropped, from, the, name, and, the, second, edition, of, the, oed, or, the, oed2, was, published, the, first, edition, retronymically, became, the, oed1, the, oxford, english, dictionary, 2, was, printed, in, 20, volumes, up, to, a, very, late, stage, all, the, volumes, of, the, first, edition, were, started, on, letter, boundaries, for, the, second, edition, there, was, no, attempt, to, start, them, on, letter, boundaries, and, they, were, made, roughly, equal, in, size, the, 20, volumes, started, with, a, b, b, c, cham, creel, dvandva, follow, hat, interval, look, moul, ow, poise, quemadero, rob, ser, soot, su, thru, unemancipated, and, wave, the, content, of, the, oed2, is, mostly, just, a, reorganization, of, the, earlier, corpus, but, the, retypesetting, provided, an, opportunity, for, two, long, needed, format, changes, the, headword, of, each, entry, was, no, longer, capitalized, allowing, the, user, to, readily, see, those, words, that, actually, require, a, capital, letter, murray, had, devised, his, own, notation, for, pronunciation, there, being, no, standard, available, at, the, time, whereas, the, oed2, adopted, the, modern, international, phonetic, alphabet, unlike, the, earlier, edition, all, foreign, alphabets, except, greek, were, transliterated, following, page, 832, of, volume, xx, wave, zyxt, there, s, a, 143, page, separately, paginated, bibliography, a, conflation, of, the, oed, 1st, edition, s, published, with, the, 1933, supplement, and, that, in, volume, iv, of, the, supplement, published, in, 1986, the, british, quiz, show, countdown, awarded, the, leather, bound, complete, version, to, the, champions, of, each, series, between, its, inception, in, 1982, and, series, 63, in, 2010, the, prize, was, axed, after, series, 83, completed, in, june, 2021, due, to, being, considered, out, of, date, when, the, print, version, of, the, second, edition, was, published, in, 1989, the, response, was, enthusiastic, author, anthony, burgess, declared, it, the, greatest, publishing, event, of, the, century, as, quoted, by, the, los, angeles, times, time, dubbed, the, book, a, scholarly, everest, and, richard, boston, writing, for, the, guardian, called, it, one, of, the, wonders, of, the, world, the, supplements, and, their, integration, into, the, second, edition, were, a, great, improvement, to, the, oed, as, a, whole, but, it, was, recognized, that, most, of, the, entries, were, still, fundamentally, unaltered, from, the, first, edition, much, of, the, information, in, the, dictionary, published, in, 1989, was, already, decades, out, of, date, though, the, supplements, had, made, good, progress, towards, incorporating, new, vocabulary, yet, many, definitions, contained, disproven, scientific, theories, outdated, historical, information, and, moral, values, that, were, no, longer, widely, accepted, furthermore, the, supplements, had, failed, to, recognize, many, words, in, the, existing, volumes, as, obsolete, by, the, time, of, the, second, edition, s, publication, meaning, that, thousands, of, words, were, marked, as, current, despite, no, recent, evidence, of, their, use, accordingly, it, was, recognized, that, work, on, a, third, edition, would, have, to, begin, to, rectify, these, problems, the, first, attempt, to, produce, a, new, edition, came, with, the, oxford, english, dictionary, additions, series, a, new, set, of, supplements, to, complement, the, oed2, with, the, intention, of, producing, a, third, edition, from, them, the, previous, supplements, appeared, in, alphabetical, instalments, whereas, the, new, series, had, a, full, a, z, range, of, entries, within, each, individual, volume, with, a, complete, alphabetical, index, at, the, end, of, all, words, revised, so, far, each, listed, with, the, volume, number, which, contained, the, revised, entry, however, in, the, end, only, three, additions, volumes, were, published, this, way, two, in, 1993, and, one, in, 1997, each, containing, about, 3, 000, new, definitions, the, possibilities, of, the, world, wide, web, and, new, computer, technology, in, general, meant, that, the, processes, of, researching, the, dictionary, and, of, publishing, new, and, revised, entries, could, be, vastly, improved, new, text, search, databases, offered, vastly, more, material, for, the, editors, of, the, dictionary, to, work, with, and, with, publication, on, the, web, as, a, possibility, the, editors, could, publish, revised, entries, much, more, quickly, and, easily, than, ever, before, a, new, approach, was, called, for, and, for, this, reason, it, was, decided, to, embark, on, a, new, complete, revision, of, the, dictionary, beginning, with, the, launch, of, the, first, oed, online, site, in, 2000, the, editors, of, the, dictionary, began, a, major, revision, project, to, create, a, completely, revised, third, edition, of, the, dictionary, oed3, expected, to, be, completed, in, 2037, at, a, projected, cost, of, about, 34, million, revisions, were, started, at, the, letter, m, with, new, material, appearing, every, three, months, on, the, oed, online, website, the, editors, chose, to, start, the, revision, project, from, the, middle, of, the, dictionary, in, order, that, the, overall, quality, of, entries, be, made, more, even, since, the, later, entries, in, the, oed1, generally, tended, to, be, better, than, the, earlier, ones, however, in, march, 2008, the, editors, announced, that, they, would, alternate, each, quarter, between, moving, forward, in, the, alphabet, as, before, and, updating, key, english, words, from, across, the, alphabet, along, with, the, other, words, which, make, up, the, alphabetical, cluster, surrounding, them, with, the, relaunch, of, the, oed, online, website, in, december, 2010, alphabetical, revision, was, abandoned, altogether, the, revision, is, expected, roughly, to, double, the, dictionary, in, size, apart, from, general, updates, to, include, information, on, new, words, and, other, changes, in, the, language, the, third, edition, brings, many, other, improvements, including, changes, in, formatting, and, stylistic, conventions, for, easier, reading, and, computerized, searching, more, etymological, information, and, a, general, change, of, focus, away, from, individual, words, towards, more, general, coverage, of, the, language, as, a, whole, while, the, original, text, drew, its, quotations, mainly, from, literary, sources, such, as, novels, plays, and, poetry, with, additional, material, from, newspapers, and, academic, journals, the, new, edition, will, reference, more, kinds, of, material, that, were, unavailable, to, the, editors, of, previous, editions, such, as, wills, inventories, account, books, diaries, journals, and, letters, john, simpson, was, the, first, chief, editor, of, the, oed3, he, retired, in, 2013, and, was, replaced, by, michael, proffitt, who, is, the, eighth, chief, editor, of, the, dictionary, the, production, of, the, new, edition, exploits, computer, technology, particularly, since, the, inauguration, in, june, 2005, of, the,

the, numbering, of, definitions, this, system, has, also, simplified, the, use, of, the, quotations, database, and, enabled, staff, in, new, york, to, work, directly, on, the, dictionary, in, the, same, way, as, their, oxford, based, counterparts, other, important, computer, uses, include, internet, searches, for, evidence, of, current, usage, and, email, submissions, of, quotations, by, readers, and, the, general, public, wordhunt, was, a, 2005, appeal, to, the, general, public, for, help, in, providing, citations, for, 50, selected, recent, words, and, produced, antedatings, for,

are, directly, related, to, the, oed, itself, the, shorter, oxford, english, dictionary, originally, started, in, 1902, and, completed, in, 1933, is, an, abridgement, of, the, full, work, that, retains, the, historical, focus, but, does, not, include, any, words, which, were, obsolete, before, 1700, except, those, used, by, shakespeare, milton, spenser, and, the, king, james, bible, a, completely, new, edition, was, produced, from, the, oed2, and, published, in, 1993, with, revisions, in, 2002, and, 2007, the, concise, oxford, dictionary, is, a, different, work, which, aims, to, cover, current, english, only, without, the, historical, focus, the, original, edition, mostly, based, on, the, oed1, was, edited, by, francis, george, fowler, and, henry, watson, fowler, and, published, in, 1911, before, the, main, work, was, completed, revised, editions, appeared, throughout, the, twentieth, century, to, keep, it, up, to, date, with, changes, in, english, usage, the, pocket, oxford, dictionary, of, current, english, was, originally, conceived, by, f, g, fowler, and, h, w, fowler, to, be, compressed, compact, and, concise, its, primary, source, is, the, oxford, english, dictionary, and, it, is, nominally, an, abridgement, of, the, concise, oxford, dictionary, it, was, first, published, in, 1924, in, 1998, the, new, oxford, dictionary, of, english, node, was, published, while, also, aiming, to, cover, current, english, node, was, not, based, on, the, oed, instead, it, was, an, entirely, new, dictionary, produced, with, the, aid, of, corpus, linguistics, once, node, was, published, a, similarly, brand, new, edition, of, the, concise, oxford, dictionary, followed, this, time, based, on, an, abridgement, of, node, rather, than, the, oed, node, under, the, new, title, of, the, oxford, dictionary, of, english, or, ode, continues, to, be, principal, source, for, oxford, s, product, line, of, current, english, dictionaries, including, the, new, oxford, american, dictionary, with, the, oed, now, only, serving, as, the, basis, for, scholarly, historical, dictionaries, the, oed, lists, british, headword, spellings, e, g, labour, centre, with, variants, following, labor, center, etc, for, the, suffix, more, commonly, spelt, ise, in, british, english, oup, policy, dictates, a, preference, for, the, spelling, ize, e, g, realize, vs, realise, and, globalization, vs, globalisation, the, rationale, is, etymological, in, that, the, english, suffix, is, mainly, derived, from, the, greek, suffix, izein, or, the, latin, iz, re, however, ze, is, also, sometimes, treated, as, an, americanism, insofar, as, the, ze, suffix, has, crept, into, words, where, it, did, not, originally, belong, as, with, analyse, british, english, which, is, spelt, analyze, in, american, english, british, prime, minister, stanley, baldwin, described, the, oed, as, a, national, treasure, author, anu, garg, founder, of, wordsmith, org, has, called, it, a, lex, icon, tim, bray, co, creator, of, extensible, markup, language, xml, credits, the, oed, as, the, developing, inspiration, of, that, markup, language, however, despite, its, claims, of, authority, the, dictionary, has, been, criticized, since, the, 1960s, because, of, its, scope, its, claims, to, authority, its, british, centredness, and, relative, neglect, of, world, englishes, its, implied, but, unacknowledged, focus, on, literary, language, and, above, all, its, influence, the, oed, as, a, commercial, product, has, always, had, to, steer, a, line, between, scholarship, and, marketing, in, his, review, of, the, 1982, supplement, university, of, oxford, linguist, roy, harris, writes, that, criticizing, the, oed, is, extremely, difficult, because, one, is, dealing, not, just, with, a, dictionary, but, with, a, national, institution, one, that, has, become, like, the, english, monarchy, virtually, immune, from, criticism, in, principle, he, further, notes, that, neologisms, from, respected, literary, authors, such, as, samuel, beckett, and, virginia, woolf, are, included, whereas, usage, of, words, in, newspapers, or, other, less, respectable, sources, hold, less, sway, even, though, they, may, be, commonly, used, he, writes, that, the, oed, s, lack, and, white, lexicography, is, also, black, and, white, in, that, it, takes, upon, itself, to, pronounce, authoritatively, on, the, rights, and, wrongs, of, usage, faulting, the, dictionary, s, prescriptive, rather, than, descriptive, usage, to, harris, this, prescriptive, classification, of, certain, usages, as, erroneous, and, the, complete, omission, of, various, forms, and, usages, cumulatively, represent, the, social, bias, of, the, presumably, well, educated, and, wealthy, compilers, however, the, guide, to, the, third, edition, of, the, oed, has, stated, that, oxford, english, dictionary, is, not, an, arbiter, of, proper, usage, despite, its, widespread, reputation, to, the, contrary, and, that, the, dictionary, is, intended, to, be, descriptive, not, prescriptive, the, identification, of, erroneous, and, catachrestic, usages, is, being, removed, from, third, edition, entries, sometimes, in, favour, of, usage, notes, describing, the, attitudes, to, language, which, have, previously, led, to, these, classifications, another, avenue, of, criticism, is, the, dictionary, s, non, inclusion, of, etymologies, for, words, of, aave, or, african, language, origin, such, as, jazz, dig, or, badmouth, the, latter, two, are, possibly, of, wolof, and, mandinka, languages, respectively, as, of, 2022, oup, is, preparing, a, specialized, oxford, dictionary, of, african, american, english, in, collaboration, with, harvard, university, s, hutchins, center, for, african, and, african, american, research, with, literary, critic, henry, louis, gates, jr, being, the, project, s, editor, in, chief, harris, also, faults, the, editors, donnish, conservatism, and, their, adherence, to, prudish, victorian, morals, citing, as, an, example, the, non, inclusion, of, various, centuries, old, four, letter, words, until, 1972, however, no, english, dictionary, included, such, profanity, for, fear, of, possible, prosecution, under, british, obscenity, laws, until, after, the, conclusion, of, the, lady, chatterley, s, lover, obscenity, trial, in, 1960, the, penguin, english, dictionary, of, 1965, was, the, first, dictionary, that, included, the, word, fuck, joseph, wright, s, english, dialect, dictionary, had, included, shit, in, 1905, the, oed, s, claims, of, authority, have, also, been, questioned, by, linguists, such, as, pius, ten, hacken, who, notes, that, the, dictionary, actively, strives, toward, definitiveness, and, authority, but, can, only, achieve, those, goals, in, a, limited, sense, given, the, difficulties, of, defining, the, scope, of, what, it, includes, founding, editor, james, murray, was, also, reluctant, to, include, scientific, terms, despite, their, documentation, unless, he, felt, that, they, were, widely, enough, used, in, 1902, he, declined, to, add, the, word, radium, to, the, dictionary, the, oed, has, been, used, to, support, research, in, fields, such, as, linguistics, psycholinguistics, and, psychology, examples, include, the, extension, of, word, meanings, via, metaphor, the, evolution, of, measurement, terms, like, foot, from, concrete, to, abstract, meanings, and, the, identification, of, systematic, patterns, in, word, blends, e, g, brunch, from, a, blend, of, breakfast, and, lunch
