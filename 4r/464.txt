a, parody, is, a, creative, work, designed, to, imitate, comment, on, and, or, mock, its, subject, by, means, of, satirical, or, ironic, imitation, often, its, subject, is, an, original, work, or, some, aspect, of, it, theme, content, author, style, etc, but, a, parody, can, also, be, about, a, real, life, person, e, g, a, politician, event, or, movement, e, g, the, french, revolution, or, 1960s, counterculture, literary, scholar, professor, simon, dentith, defines, parody, as, any, cultural, practice, which, provides, a, relatively, polemical, allusive, imitation, of, another, cultural, production, or, practice, the, literary, theorist, linda, hutcheon, said, parody, is, imitation, not, always, at, the, expense, of, the, parodied, text, parody, may, be, found, in, art, or, culture, including, literature, music, theater, television, and, film, animation, and, gaming, some, parody, is, practiced, in, theater, the, writer, and, critic, john, gross, observes, in, his, oxford, book, of, parodies, that, parody, seems, to, flourish, on, territory, somewhere, between, pastiche, a, composition, in, another, artist, s, manner, without, satirical, intent, and, burlesque, which, fools, around, with, the, material, of, high, literature, and, adapts, it, to, low, ends, meanwhile, the, encyclop, die, of, denis, diderot, distinguishes, between, the, parody, and, the, burlesque, a, good, parody, is, a, fine, amusement, capable, of, amusing, and, instructing, the, most, sensible, and, polished, minds, the, burlesque, is, a, miserable, buffoonery, which, can, only, please, the, populace, historically, when, a, formula, grows, tired, as, in, the, case, of, the, moralistic, melodramas, in, the, 1910s, it, retains, value, only, as, a, parody, as, demonstrated, by, the, buster, keaton, shorts, that, mocked, that, genre, a, parody, may, also, be, known, as, a, spoof, a, satire, a, send, up, a, take, off, a, lampoon, a, play, on, something, or, a, caricature, according, to, aristotle, poetics, ii, 5, hegemon, of, thasos, was, the, inventor, of, a, kind, of, parody, by, slightly, altering, the, wording, in, well, known, poems, he, transformed, the, sublime, into, the, ridiculous, in, ancient, greek, literature, a, parodia, was, a, narrative, poem, imitating, the, style, and, prosody, of, epics, but, treating, light, satirical, or, mock, heroic, subjects, indeed, the, components, of, the, greek, word, are, para, beside, counter, against, and, oide, song, thus, the, original, greek, word, parodia, has, sometimes, been, taken, to, mean, counter, song, an, imitation, that, is, set, against, the, original, the, oxford, english, dictionary, for, example, defines, parody, as, imitation, turned, as, to, produce, a, ridiculous, effect, because, par, also, has, the, non, antagonistic, meaning, of, beside, there, is, nothing, in, parodia, to, necessitate, the, inclusion, of, a, concept, of, ridicule, in, greek, old, comedy, even, the, gods, could, be, made, fun, of, the, frogs, portrays, the, hero, turned, god, heracles, as, a, glutton, and, the, god, of, drama, dionysus, as, cowardly, and, unintelligent, the, traditional, trip, to, the, underworld, story, is, parodied, as, dionysus, dresses, as, heracles, to, go, to, the, underworld, in, an, attempt, to, bring, back, a, poet, to, save, athens, the, ancient, greeks, created, satyr, plays, which, parodied, tragic, plays, often, with, performers, dressed, like, satyrs, parody, was, used, in, early, greek, philosophical, texts, to, make, philosophical, points, such, texts, are, known, as, spoudaiogeloion, a, famous, example, of, which, is, the, silloi, by, pyrrhonist, philosopher, timon, of, phlius, which, parodied, philosophers, living, and, dead, the, style, was, a, rhetorical, mainstay, of, the, cynics, and, was, the, most, common, tone, of, the, works, made, by, menippus, and, meleager, of, gadara, in, the, 2nd, century, ce, lucian, of, samosata, created, a, parody, of, travel, texts, such, as, indica, and, the, odyssey, he, described, the, authors, of, such, accounts, as, liars, who, had, never, traveled, nor, ever, talked, to, any, credible, person, who, had, in, his, ironically, named, book, true, history, lucian, delivers, a, story, which, exaggerates, the, hyperbole, and, improbable, claims, of, those, stories, sometimes, described, as, the, first, science, fiction, the, characters, travel, to, the, moon, engage, in, interplanetary, war, with, the, help, of, aliens, they, meet, there, and, then, return, to, earth, to, experience, civilization, inside, a, 200, mile, long, creature, generally, interpreted, as, being, a, whale, this, is, a, parody, of, ctesias, claims, that, india, has, a, one, legged, race, of, humans, with, a, single, foot, so, huge, it, can, be, used, as, an, umbrella, homer, s, stories, of, one, eyed, giants, and, so, on, parody, exists, in, the, following, related, genres, satire, travesty, pastiche, skit, burlesque, satires, and, parodies, are, both, derivative, works, that, exaggerate, their, source, material, s, in, humorous, ways, however, a, satire, is, meant, to, make, fun, of, the, real, world, whereas, a, parody, is, a, derivative, of, a, specific, work, specific, parody, or, a, general, genre, general, parody, or, spoof, furthermore, satires, are, provocative, and, critical, as, they, point, to, a, specific, vice, associated, with, an, individual, or, a, group, of, people, to, mock, them, into, correction, or, as, a, form, of, punishment, in, contrast, parodies, are, more, focused, on, producing, playful, humor, and, do, not, always, attack, or, criticize, its, targeted, work, and, or, genre, of, course, it, is, possible, for, a, parody, to, maintain, satiric, elements, without, crossing, into, satire, itself, as, long, as, its, light, verse, with, modest, aspirations, ultimately, dominates, the, work, a, travesty, imitates, and, transforms, a, work, but, focuses, more, on, the, satirization, of, it, because, satire, is, meant, to, attack, someone, or, something, the, harmless, playfulness, of, parody, is, lost, a, pastiche, imitates, a, work, as, a, parody, does, but, unlike, a, parody, pastiche, is, neither, transformative, of, the, original, work, nor, is, it, humorous, literary, critic, fredric, jameson, has, referred, to, the, pastiche, as, a, blank, parody, or, parody, that, has, lost, its, sense, of, humor, skits, imitate, works, in, a, satirical, regime, but, unlike, travesties, skits, do, not, transform, the, source, material, the, burlesque, primarily, targets, heroic, poems, and, theater, to, degrade, popular, heroes, and, gods, as, well, as, mock, the, common, tropes, within, the, genre, simon, dentith, has, described, this, type, of, parody, as, parodic, anti, heroic, drama, a, parody, imitates, and, mocks, a, specific, recognizable, work, e, g, a, book, movie, etc, or, the, characteristic, style, of, a, particular, author, a, spoof, mocks, an, entire, genre, by, exaggerating, its, conventions, and, cliches, for, humorous, effect, in, classical, music, as, a, technical, term, parody, refers, to, a, reworking, of, one, kind, of, composition, into, another, for, example, a, motet, into, a, keyboard, work, as, girolamo, cavazzoni, antonio, de, cabez, n, and, alonso, mudarra, all, did, to, josquin, des, prez, motets, more, commonly, a, parody, mass, missa, parodia, or, an, oratorio, used, extensive, quotation, from, other, vocal, works, such, as, motets, or, cantatas, victoria, palestrina, lassus, and, other, composers, of, the, 16th, century, used, this, technique, the, term, is, also, sometimes, applied, to, procedures, common, in, the, baroque, period, such, as, when, bach, reworks, music, from, cantatas, in, his, christmas, oratorio, the, musicological, definition, of, the, term, parody, has, now, generally, been, supplanted, by, a, more, general, meaning, of, the, word, in, its, more, contemporary, usage, musical, parody, usually, has, humorous, even, satirical, intent, in, which, familiar, musical, ideas, or, lyrics, are, lifted, into, a, different, often, incongruous, context, musical, parodies, may, imitate, or, refer, to, the, peculiar, style, of, a, composer, or, artist, or, even, a, general, style, of, music, for, example, the, ritz, roll, and, rock, a, song, and, dance, number, performed, by, fred, astaire, in, the, movie, silk, stockings, parodies, the, rock, and, roll, genre, conversely, while, the, best, known, work, of, weird, al, yankovic, is, based, on, particular, popular, songs, it, also, often, utilises, wildly, incongruous, elements, of, pop, culture, for, comedic, effect, the, first, usage, of, the, word, parody, in, english, cited, in, the, oxford, english, dictionary, is, in, ben, jonson, in, every, man, in, his, humour, in, 1598, a, parodie, a, parodie, to, make, it, absurder, than, it, was, the, next, citation, comes, from, john, dryden, in, 1693, who, also, appended, an, explanation, suggesting, that, the, word, was, in, common, use, meaning, to, make, fun, of, or, re, create, what, you, are, doing, since, the, 20th, century, parody, has, been, heightened, as, the, central, and, most, representative, artistic, device, the, catalysing, agent, of, artistic, creation, and, innovation, this, most, prominently, happened, in, the, second, half, of, the, century, with, postmodernism, but, earlier, modernism, and, russian, formalism, had, anticipated, this, perspective, for, the, russian, formalists, parody, was, a, way, of, liberation, from, the, background, text, that, enables, to, produce, new, and, autonomous, artistic, forms, historian, christopher, rea, writes, that, in, the, 1910s, and, 1920s, writers, in, china, s, entertainment, market, parodied, anything, and, everything, they, parodied, speeches, advertisements, confessions, petitions, orders, handbills, notices, policies, regulations, resolutions, discourses, explications, sutras, memorials, to, the, throne, and, conference, minutes, we, have, an, exchange, of, letters, between, the, queue, and, the, beard, and, eyebrows, we, have, a, eulogy, for, a, chamber, pot, we, have, research, on, why, men, have, beards, and, women, don, t, a, telegram, from, the, thunder, god, to, his, mother, resigning, his, post, and, a, public, notice, from, the, king, of, whoring, prohibiting, playboys, from, skipping, debts, jorge, luis, borges, s, 1939, short, story, pierre, menard, author, of, the, quixote, is, often, regarded, as, predicting, postmodernism, and, conceiving, the, ideal, of, the, ultimate, parody, in, the, broader, sense, of, greek, parodia, parody, can, occur, when, whole, elements, of, one, work, are, lifted, out, of, their, context, and, reused, not, necessarily, to, be, ridiculed, traditional, definitions, of, parody, usually, only, discuss, parody, in, the, stricter, sense, of, something, intended, to, ridicule, the, text, it, parodies, there, is, also, a, broader, extended, sense, of, parody, that, may, not, include, ridicule, and, may, be, based, on, many, other, uses, and, intentions, the, broader, sense, of, parody, parody, done, with, intent, other, than, ridicule, has, become, prevalent, in, the, modern, parody, of, the, 20th, century, in, the, extended, sense, the, modern, parody, does, not, target, the, parodied, text, but, instead, uses, it, as, a, weapon, to, target, something, else, the, reason, for, the, prevalence, of, the, extended, recontextualizing, type, of, parody, in, the, 20th, century, is, that, artists, have, sought, to, connect, with, the, past, while, registering, differences, brought, by, modernity, major, modernist, examples, of, this, recontextualizing, parody, include, james, joyce, s, ulysses, which, incorporates, elements, of, homer, s, odyssey, in, a, 20th, century, irish, context, and, t, s, eliot, s, the, waste, land, which, incorporates, and, recontextualizes, elements, of, a, vast, range, of, prior, texts, including, dante, s, the, inferno, the, work, of, andy, warhol, is, another, prominent, example, of, the, modern, recontextualizing, parody, according, to, french, literary, theorist, g, rard, genette, the, most, rigorous, and, elegant, form, of, parody, is, also, the, most, economical, that, is, a, minimal, parody, the, one, that, literally, reprises, a, known, text, and, gives, it, a, new, meaning, blank, parody, in, which, an, artist, takes, the, skeletal, form, of, an, art, work, and, places, it, in, a, new, context, without, ridiculing, it, is, common, pastiche, is, a, closely, related, genre, and, parody, can, also, occur, when, characters, or, settings, belonging, to, one, work, are, used, in, a, humorous, or, ironic, way, in, another, such, as, the, transformation, of, minor, characters, rosencrantz, and, guildenstern, from, shakespeare, s, drama, hamlet, into, the, principal, characters, in, a, comedic, perspective, on, the, same, events, in, the, play, and, film, rosencrantz, and, guildenstern, are, dead, similarly, mishu, hilmy, s, trapped, in, the, netflix, uses, parody, to, deconstruct, contemporary, netflix, shows, like, mad, men, providing, commentary, through, popular, characters, don, draper, mansplaining, about, mansplaining, luke, danes, monologizing, about, a, lack, of, independence, while, embracing, codependency, in, flann, o, brien, s, novel, at, swim, two, birds, for, example, mad, king, sweeney, finn, maccool, a, pookah, and, an, assortment, of, cowboys, all, assemble, in, an, inn, in, dublin, the, mixture, of, mythic, characters, characters, from, genre, fiction, and, a, quotidian, setting, combine, for, a, humor, that, is, not, directed, at, any, of, the, characters, or, their, authors, this, combination, of, established, and, identifiable, characters, in, a, new, setting, is, not, the, same, as, the, post, modernist, trope, of, using, historical, characters, in, fiction, out, of, context, to, provide, a, metaphoric, element, sometimes, the, reputation, of, a, parody, outlasts, the, reputation, of, what, is, being, parodied, for, example, don, quixote, which, mocks, the, traditional, knight, errant, tales, is, much, better, known, than, the, novel, that, inspired, it, amadis, de, gaula, although, amadis, is, mentioned, in, the, book, another, case, is, the, novel, shamela, by, henry, fielding, 1742, which, was, a, parody, of, the, gloomy, epistolary, novel, pamela, or, virtue, rewarded, 1740, by, samuel, richardson, many, of, lewis, carroll, s, parodies, of, victorian, didactic, verse, for, children, such, as, you, are, old, father, william, are, much, better, known, than, the, largely, forgotten, originals, stella, gibbons, s, comic, novel, cold, comfort, farm, has, eclipsed, the, pastoral, novels, of, mary, webb, which, largely, inspired, it, in, more, recent, times, the, television, sitcom, allo, allo, is, perhaps, better, known, than, the, drama, secret, army, which, it, parodies, some, artists, carve, out, careers, by, making, parodies, one, of, the, best, known, examples, is, that, of, weird, al, yankovic, his, career, of, parodying, other, musical, acts, and, their, songs, has, outlasted, many, of, the, artists, or, bands, he, has, parodied, yankovic, is, not, required, under, law, to, get, permission, to, parody, as, a, personal, rule, however, he, does, seek, permission, to, parody, a, person, s, song, before, recording, it, several, artists, such, as, rapper, chamillionaire, and, seattle, based, grunge, band, nirvana, stated, that, yankovic, s, parodies, of, their, respective, songs, were, excellent, and, many, artists, have, considered, being, parodied, by, him, to, be, a, badge, of, honor, in, the, us, legal, system, the, point, that, in, most, cases, a, parody, of, a, work, constitutes, fair, use, was, upheld, in, the, case, of, rick, dees, who, decided, to, use, 29, seconds, of, the, music, from, the, song, when, sonny, gets, blue, to, parody, johnny, mathis, singing, style, even, after, being, refused, permission, an, appeals, court, upheld, the, trial, court, s, decision, that, this, type, of, parody, represents, fair, use, fisher, v, dees, 794, f, 2d, 432, 9th, cir, 1986, some, genre, theorists, following, bakhtin, see, parody, as, a, natural, development, in, the, life, cycle, of, any, genre, this, idea, has, proven, especially, fruitful, for, genre, film, theorists, such, theorists, note, that, western, movies, for, example, after, the, classic, stage, defined, the, conventions, of, the, genre, underwent, a, parody, stage, in, which, those, same, conventions, were, ridiculed, and, critiqued, because, audiences, had, seen, these, classic, westerns, they, had, expectations, for, any, new, westerns, and, when, these, expectations, were, inverted, the, audience, laughed, an, early, parody, film, was, the, 1922, movie, mud, and, sand, a, stan, laurel, film, that, made, fun, of, rudolph, valentino, s, film, blood, and, sand, laurel, specialized, in, parodies, in, the, mid, 1920s, writing, and, acting, in, a, number, of, them, some, were, send, ups, of, popular, films, such, as, dr, jekyll, and, mr, hyde, parodied, in, the, comic, dr, pyckle, and, mr, pryde, 1926, others, were, spoofs, of, broadway, plays, such, as, no, no, nanette, 1925, parodied, as, yes, yes, nanette, 1925, in, 1940, charlie, chaplin, created, a, satirical, comedy, about, adolf, hitler, with, the, film, the, great, dictator, following, the, first, ever, hollywood, parody, of, the, nazis, the, three, stooges, short, subject, you, nazty, spy, about, 20, years, later, mel, brooks, started, his, career, with, a, hitler, parody, as, well, after, his, 1967, film, the, producers, won, both, an, academy, award, and, a, writers, guild, of, america, award, for, best, original, screenplay, brooks, became, one, of, the, most, famous, film, parodists, and, created, spoofs, in, multiple, film, genres, blazing, saddles, 1974, is, a, parody, of, western, films, history, of, the, world, part, i, 1981, is, a, historical, parody, robin, hood, men, in, tights, 1993, is, brooks, take, on, the, classic, robin, hood, tale, and, his, spoofs, in, the, horror, sci, fi, and, adventure, genres, include, young, frankenstein, 1974, and, spaceballs, 1987, a, star, wars, spoof, the, british, comedy, group, monty, python, is, also, famous, for, its, parodies, for, example, the, king, arthur, spoof, monty, python, and, the, holy, grail, 1974, and, the, jesus, satire, life, of, brian, 1979, in, the, 1980s, the, team, of, david, zucker, jim, abrahams, and, jerry, zucker, parodied, well, established, genres, such, as, disaster, war, and, police, movies, with, the, airplane, hot, shots, and, naked, gun, series, respectively, there, is, a, 1989, film, parody, from, spain, of, the, tv, series, the, a, team, called, el, equipo, aahhgg, directed, by, jos, truchado, more, recently, parodies, have, taken, on, whole, film, genres, at, once, one, of, the, first, was, don, t, be, a, menace, to, south, central, while, drinking, your, juice, in, the, hood, and, the, scary, movie, franchise, other, recent,

vampires, suck, and, the, 41, year, old, virgin, who, knocked, up, sarah, marshall, and, felt, superbad, about, it, all, of, which, have, been, critically, panned, many, parody, films, have, as, their, target, out, of, copyright, or, non, copyrighted, subjects, such, as, frankenstein, or, robin, hood, whilst, others, settle, for, imitation, which, does, not, infringe, copyright, but, is, clearly, aimed, at, a, popular, and, usually, lucrative, subject, the, spy, film, craze, of, the, 1960s, fuelled, by, the, popularity, of, james, bond, is, such, an, example, in, this, genre, a, rare, and, possibly, unique, example, of, a, parody, film, taking, aim, at, a, non, comedic, subject, over, which, it, actually, holds, copyright, is, the, 1967, james, bond, spoof, casino, royale, in, this, case, producer, charles, k, feldman, initially, intended, to, make, a, serious, film, but, decided, that, it, would, not, be, able, to, compete, with, the, established, series, of, bond, films, hence, he, decided, to, parody, the, series, kenneth, baker, considered, poetic, parody, to, take, five, main, forms, a, further, more, constructive, form, of, poetic, parody, is, one, that, links, the, contemporary, poet, with, past, forms, and, past, masters, through, affectionate, parodying, thus, sharing, poetic, codes, while, avoiding, some, of, the, anxiety, of, influence, more, aggressive, in, tone, are, playground, poetry, parodies, often, attacking, authority, values, and, culture, itself, in, a, carnivalesque, rebellion, twinkle, twinkle, little, star, who, the, hell, do, you, think, you, are, a, subset, of, parody, is, self, parody, in, which, artists, parody, their, own, work, as, in, ricky, gervais, s, extras, although, a, parody, can, be, considered, a, derivative, work, of, a, pre, existing, copyrighted, work, some, countries, have, ruled, that, parodies, can, fall, under, copyright, limitations, such, as, fair, dealing, or, otherwise, have, fair, dealing, laws, that, include, parody, in, their, scope, parodies, are, protected, under, the, fair, use, doctrine, of, united, states, copyright, law, but, the, defense, is, more, successful, if, the, usage, of, an, existing, copyrighted, work, is, transformative, in, nature, such, as, being, a, critique, or, commentary, upon, it, in, campbell, v, acuff, rose, music, inc, the, supreme, court, ruled, that, a, rap, parody, of, oh, pretty, woman, by, 2, live, crew, was, fair, use, as, the, parody, was, a, distinctive, transformative, work, designed, to, ridicule, the, original, song, and, that, even, if, 2, live, crew, s, copying, of, the, original, s, first, line, of, lyrics, and, characteristic, opening, bass, riff, may, be, said, to, go, to, the, original, s, heart, that, heart, is, what, most, readily, conjures, up, the, song, for, parody, and, it, is, the, heart, at, which, parody, takes, aim, in, 2001, the, eleventh, circuit, court, of, appeals, in, suntrust, v, houghton, mifflin, upheld, the, right, of, alice, randall, to, publish, a, parody, of, gone, with, the, wind, called, the, wind, done, gone, which, told, the, same, story, from, the, point, of, view, of, scarlett, o, hara, s, slaves, who, were, glad, to, be, rid, of, her, in, 2007, the, ninth, circuit, court, of, appeals, denied, a, fair, use, defense, in, the, dr, seuss, enterprises, v, penguin, books, case, citing, the, campbell, v, acuff, rose, decision, they, found, that, a, satire, of, the, o, j, simpson, murder, trial, and, parody, of, the, cat, in, the, hat, had, infringed, upon, the, children, s, book, because, it, did, not, provide, a, commentary, function, upon, that, work, under, canadian, law, although, there, is, protection, for, fair, dealing, there, is, no, explicit, protection, for, parody, and, satire, in, canwest, v, horizon, the, publisher, of, the, vancouver, sun, launched, a, lawsuit, against, a, group, which, had, published, a, pro, palestinian, parody, of, the, paper, alan, donaldson, the, judge, in, the, case, ruled, that, parody, is, not, a, defence, to, a, copyright, claim, as, of, the, implementation, of, the, copyright, modernization, act, 2012, fair, dealing, for, the, purpose, of, research, private, study, education, parody, or, satire, does, not, infringe, copyright, in, 2006, the, gowers, review, of, intellectual, property, recommended, that, the, uk, should, create, an, exception, to, copyright, for, the, purpose, of, caricature, parody, or, pastiche, by, 2008, following, the, first, stage, of, a, two, part, public, consultation, the, intellectual, property, office, reported, that, the, information, received, was, not, sufficient, to, persuade, us, that, the, advantages, of, a, new, parody, exception, were, sufficient, to, override, the, disadvantages, to, the, creators, and, owners, of, the, underlying, work, there, is, therefore, no, proposal, to, change, the, current, approach, to, parody, caricature, and, pastiche, in, the, uk, however, following, the, hargreaves, review, in, may, 2011, which, made, similar, proposals, to, the, gowers, review, the, government, broadly, accepted, these, proposals, the, current, law, effective, from, 1, october, 2014, namely, section, 30a, of, the, copyright, designs, and, patents, act, 1988, now, provides, an, exception, to, infringement, where, there, is, fair, dealing, of, the, original, work, for, the, purpose, of, parody, or, alternatively, for, the, purpose, of, caricature, or, pastiche, the, legislation, does, not, define, what, is, meant, by, parody, but, the, uk, ipo,
