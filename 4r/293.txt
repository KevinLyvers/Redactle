the, duino, elegies, german, duineser, elegien, are, a, collection, of, ten, elegies, written, by, the, bohemian, austrian, poet, rainer, maria, rilke, he, was, then, widely, recognized, as, one, of, the, most, lyrically, intense, german, language, poets, and, began, the, elegies, in, 1912, while, a, guest, of, princess, marie, von, thurn, und, taxis, at, duino, castle, on, the, adriatic, sea, the, poems, were, dedicated, to, the, princess, upon, their, publication, in, 1923, during, this, ten, year, period, the, elegies, languished, incomplete, for, long, stretches, of, time, as, rilke, had, frequent, bouts, with, severe, depression, some, of, which, were, related, to, the, events, of, world, war, i, and, being, conscripted, into, military, service, aside, from, brief, periods, of, writing, in, 1913, and, 1915, he, did, not, return, to, the, work, until, a, few, years, after, the, war, ended, with, a, sudden, renewed, burst, of, frantic, writing, which, he, described, as, a, boundless, storm, a, hurricane, of, the, spirit, he, completed, the, collection, in, february, 1922, while, staying, at, ch, teau, de, muzot, in, veyras, switzerland, after, their, publication, in, 1923, the, duino, elegies, were, soon, recognized, as, his, most, important, work, the, duino, elegies, are, intensely, religious, mystical, poems, that, employ, the, symbolism, of, angels, and, salvation, but, in, a, manner, atypical, of, christian, interpretations, rilke, begins, the, first, elegy, in, an, invocation, of, philosophical, despair, asking, who, if, i, cried, out, would, hear, me, among, the, angelic, orders, wer, wenn, ich, schriee, h, rte, mich, denn, aus, der, engel, ordnungen, and, later, declares, that, each, single, angel, is, terrifying, jeder, engel, ist, schrecklich, while, labelling, of, these, poems, as, elegies, would, typically, imply, melancholy, and, lamentation, many, passages, are, marked, by, their, positive, energy, together, the, duino, elegies, are, described, as, a, metamorphosis, of, rilke, s, ontological, torment, and, an, impassioned, monologue, about, coming, to, terms, with, human, existence, discussing, themes, of, the, limitations, and, insufficiency, of, the, human, condition, and, fractured, human, consciousness, man, s, loneliness, the, perfection, of, the, angels, life, and, death, love, and, lovers, and, the, task, of, the, poet, rilke, s, poetry, and, the, duino, elegies, in, particular, influenced, many, of, the, poets, and, writers, of, the, twentieth, century, in, popular, culture, his, work, is, frequently, quoted, on, the, subject, of, love, or, of, angels, and, referenced, in, television, programs, motion, pictures, music, and, other, artistic, works, in, new, age, philosophy, and, theology, and, in, self, help, books, in, 1910, rilke, completed, the, loosely, autobiographical, novel, die, aufzeichnungen, des, malte, laurids, brigge, the, notebooks, of, malte, laurids, brigge, in, which, a, young, poet, is, terrified, by, the, fragmentation, and, chaos, of, modern, urban, life, after, he, experienced, a, psychological, crisis, accompanied, by, severe, depression, rilke, was, invited, in, late, 1911, to, duino, castle, by, princess, marie, von, thurn, und, taxis, whom, he, had, met, a, few, years, earlier, rilke, and, marie, collaborated, on, a, translation, of, dante, s, la, vita, nuova, the, new, life, while, at, duino, after, the, princess, left, to, join, her, husband, at, their, lautschin, estate, rilke, spent, the, next, few, weeks, alone, to, focus, on, his, work, while, writing, das, marien, leben, the, life, of, mary, in, january, 1912, rilke, claimed, that, he, heard, a, voice, calling, in, the, roar, of, the, wind, while, walking, along, the, cliffs, near, the, castle, speaking, the, words, that, would, become, the, first, lines, of, the, duino, elegies, wer, wenn, ich, schriee, h, rte, mich, denn, aus, der, engel, ordnungen, who, if, i, cried, out, would, hear, me, among, the, hierarchies, of, angels, he, quickly, wrote, them, in, his, notebook, and, completed, the, draft, of, the, first, elegy, that, night, within, days, he, drafted, the, second, elegy, and, composed, passages, and, fragments, that, would, later, be, incorporated, into, later, elegies, including, the, opening, passage, of, the, tenth, elegy, in, the, following, years, rilke, worked, sporadically, on, the, elegies, while, staying, at, ronda, spain, in, 1913, he, wrote, part, of, what, would, become, the, sixth, elegy, he, moved, to, paris, later, that, year, where, he, continued, work, on, the, sixth, elegy, and, completed, the, third, elegy, during, world, war, i, rilke, wrote, the, fourth, elegy, completing, it, the, day, before, he, was, conscripted, into, the, austro, hungarian, army, in, november, 1915, after, rilke, was, discharged, in, 1916, he, returned, to, munich, for, the, duration, of, the, war, but, wrote, very, little, poetry, during, that, time, it, wasn, t, until, 1920, that, rilke, began, to, focus, on, completing, the, duino, elegies, rilke, who, had, become, romantically, involved, with, baladine, klossowska, journeyed, to, switzerland, looking, to, find, a, place, to, live, near, geneva, where, he, could, immerse, himself, in, french, culture, rilke, and, klossowska, wanted, to, move, into, the, ch, teau, de, muzot, a, 13th, century, manor, house, that, lacked, gas, and, electricity, near, veyras, in, the, rhone, valley, but, they, had, trouble, negotiating, the, lease, at, rilke, s, suggestion, werner, reinhart, a, swiss, merchant, who, used, his, wealth, to, support, composers, and, writers, leased, the, property, on, their, behalf, in, july, 1921, rilke, and, klossowska, had, moved, in, later, reinhart, bought, the, property, and, turned, it, over, to, rilke, for, life, during, the, summer, of, 1921, rilke, s, daughter, ruth, became, engaged, in, december, he, sent, a, letter, to, gertrud, ouckama, knoop, widow, of, his, deceased, friend, gerhard, ouckama, knoop, and, mother, of, the, dancer, wera, ouckama, knoop, who, was, once, a, friend, of, ruth, s, announcing, the, engagement, in, turn, gertrud, sent, an, account, of, wera, s, death, at, age, 19, that, moved, rilke, to, compose, the, sonnets, to, orpheus, and, complete, the, duino, elegies, rilke, wrote, that, wera, s, image, dominates, and, moves, the, sonnets, they, frequently, refer, to, her, directly, addressing, her, by, name, and, indirectly, through, allusions, to, a, dancer, or, the, mythical, eurydice, rilke, composed, in, a, rush, of, inspiration, writing, nearly, all, the, poems, of, part, i, of, the, sonnets, between, 2, 5, february, 1922, completing, the, duino, elegies, between, 7, 15, february, and, completing, the, remaining, poems, of, sonnets, between, 16, 22, february, rilke, saw, the, creation, of, the, sonnets, and, elegies, as, a, twin, birth, in, the, midst, of, his, writing, rilke, wrote, klossowska, that, which, weighed, upon, and, tortured, me, is, accomplished, but, never, within, my, heart, and, mind, have, i, borne, such, a, hurricane, i, am, still, trembling, from, it, and, i, went, out, to, caress, this, old, muzot, just, now, in, the, moonlight, immediately, after, completing, the, elegies, he, wrote, lou, andreas, salom, that, he, had, finished, all, in, a, few, days, it, was, a, hurricane, as, at, duino, that, time, all, that, was, fiber, fabric, in, me, framework, cracked, and, bent, duino, elegies, which, are, 859, lines, long, was, published, by, insel, verlag, in, leipzig, in, 1923, prominent, critics, praised, the, work, and, compared, its, merits, to, the, works, of, h, lderlin, and, goethe, during, the, 1920s, many, of, the, younger, generation, of, poets, and, writers, did, not, like, duino, elegies, because, of, the, poems, obscure, symbols, and, philosophy, the, poet, albrecht, schaeffer, who, is, associated, with, the, literary, circle, of, stefan, george, dismissed, the, poems, as, mystical, blather, and, described, their, secular, theology, as, impotent, gossip, novelist, hermann, hesse, describes, rilke, as, evolving, into, his, best, poetry, with, the, duino, elegies, that, at, each, stage, now, and, again, the, miracle, occurs, his, delicate, hesitant, anxiety, prone, person, withdraws, and, through, him, resounds, the, music, of, the, universe, like, the, basin, of, a, fountain, he, becomes, at, once, instrument, and, ear, in, 1935, critic, hans, rudolf, m, ller, argued, that, rilke, could, be, seen, as, a, mystic, and, the, poems, could, be, treated, as, mystical, literature, whereas, more, recent, critics, believe, the, poems, should, be, seen, as, a, study, of, mysticism, itself, theodor, w, adorno, wrote, but, the, fact, that, the, neoromantic, lyric, sometimes, behaves, like, the, jargon, or, at, least, timidly, readies, the, way, for, it, should, not, lead, us, to, look, for, the, evil, of, the, poetry, simply, in, its, form, it, is, not, simply, grounded, as, a, much, too, innocent, view, might, maintain, in, the, mixture, of, poetry, and, prose, the, evil, in, the, neoromantic, lyric, consists, in, the, fitting, out, of, the, words, with, a, theological, overtone, which, is, belied, by, the, condition, of, the, lonely, and, secular, subject, who, is, speaking, there, religion, as, ornament, adorno, further, believed, the, poems, reinforced, the, german, value, of, commitment, that, supported, a, cultural, attraction, towards, the, principles, of, nazism, throughout, the, duino, elegies, rilke, explored, themes, of, the, limitations, and, insufficiency, of, the, human, condition, and, fractured, human, consciousness, mankind, s, loneliness, the, perfection, of, the, angels, life, and, death, love, and, lovers, and, the, task, of, the, poet, philosopher, martin, heidegger, remarked, that, the, long, way, leading, to, the, poetry, is, itself, one, that, inquires, poetically, and, that, rilke, comes, to, realize, the, destitution, of, the, time, more, clearly, the, time, remains, destitute, not, only, because, god, is, dead, but, because, mortals, are, hardly, aware, and, capable, even, of, their, own, mortality, rilke, explores, the, nature, of, mankind, s, contact, with, beauty, and, its, transience, noting, that, humanity, is, forever, only, getting, a, brief, momentary, glimpse, of, an, inconceivable, beauty, and, that, it, is, terrifying, at, the, onset, of, the, first, elegy, rilke, describes, this, frightened, experience, defining, beauty, as, nothing, but, beginning, of, terror, we, re, still, just, able, to, bear, and, why, we, adore, it, so, is, because, it, serenely, disdains, to, destroy, us, rilke, depicted, this, infinite, transcendental, beauty, with, the, symbol, of, angels, however, he, did, not, use, the, traditional, christian, interpretation, of, angels, he, sought, to, utilize, a, symbol, of, the, angel, that, was, secular, divorced, from, religious, doctrine, and, embodied, a, tremendous, transcendental, beauty, in, this, however, rilke, commented, that, he, was, greatly, influenced, by, the, depiction, of, angels, found, in, islam, for, rilke, the, symbol, of, the, angel, represents, a, perfection, that, is, beyond, human, contradictions, and, limitations, in, a, higher, level, of, reality, in, the, invisible, where, there, is, incongruity, that, adds, to, mankind, s, despair, and, anxiety, is, due, to, human, nature, keeping, us, clinging, to, the, visible, and, the, familiar, as, mankind, encounters, the, invisible, and, unknown, higher, levels, represented, by, these, angels, the, experience, of, the, invisible, will, be, terrifying, in, german, schrecklich, as, mankind, came, in, contact, with, the, terrifying, beauty, represented, by, these, angels, rilke, was, concerned, with, the, experience, of, existential, angst, in, trying, to, come, to, terms, with, the, coexistence, of, the, spiritual, and, earthly, he, portrayed, human, beings, as, alone, in, a, universe, where, god, is, abstract, and, possibly, non, existent, where, memory, and, patterns, of, intuition, raise, the, sensitive, consciousness, to, a, realization, of, solitude, rilke, depicted, the, alternative, a, spiritually, fulfilling, possibility, beyond, human, limitations, in, the, form, of, angels, beginning, with, the, first, line, of, the, collection, rilke, s, despairing, speaker, calls, upon, the, angels, to, notice, human, suffering, and, to, intervene, there, is, a, deeply, felt, despair, and, unresolvable, tension, in, that, no, matter, man, s, striving, the, limitation, of, human, and, earthly, existence, renders, humanity, unable, to, reach, out, to, the, angels, the, narrative, voice, rilke, employed, in, the, duino, elegies, strives, to, achieve, in, human, consciousness, the, angel, s, presumed, plenitude, of, being, i, e, being, or, existence, in, german, dasein, rilke, used, the, images, of, love, and, of, lovers, as, a, way, of, showing, mankind, s, potential, and, humanity, s, failures, in, achieving, the, transcendent, understanding, embodied, by, the, angels, in, the, second, elegy, rilke, wrote, lovers, if, angels, could, understand, them, might, utter, strange, things, in, the, midnight, air, he, depicted, the, inadequacy, of, ordinary, lovers, and, contrasted, a, feminine, form, of, sublime, love, and, a, masculine, blind, animal, passion, at, the, time, the, first, elegies, were, written, rilke, often, expressed, a, longing, for, human, companionship, and, affection, and, then, often, immediately, afterwards, asking, whether, he, could, really, respond, to, such, companionship, if, it, were, offered, to, him, he, noticed, a, decline, in, the, lives, of, lovers, when, they, began, to, receive, they, also, began, to, lose, the, power, of, giving, later, during, world, war, i, he, would, lament, that, the, world, has, fallen, into, the, hands, of, men, in, the, face, of, death, life, and, love, are, not, cheap, and, meaningless, and, rilke, asserted, that, great, lovers, are, able, to, recognize, all, three, life, love, and, death, as, part, of, a, unity, in, a, 1923, letter, to, nanny, von, escher, rilke, confided, two, inmost, experiences, were, decisive, for, their, production, the, resolve, that, grew, up, more, and, more, in, my, spirit, to, hold, life, open, toward, death, and, on, the, other, side, the, spiritual, need, to, situate, the, transformation, of, love, in, this, wider, whole, differently, than, was, possible, in, the, narrower, orbit, of, life, which, simply, shut, out, death, as, the, other, the, fifth, elegy, is, largely, inspired, by, pablo, picasso, s, 1905, rose, period, painting, les, saltimbanques, the, acrobats, also, known, as, the, family, of, saltimbanques, in, which, picasso, depicts, six, figures, pictured, in, the, middle, of, a, desert, landscape, and, it, is, impossible, to, say, whether, they, are, arriving, or, departing, beginning, or, ending, their, performance, rilke, depicted, the, six, artists, about, to, begin, their, performance, and, that, they, were, used, as, a, symbol, of, human, activity, always, travelling, and, with, no, fixed, abode, they, are, even, a, shade, more, fleeting, than, the, rest, of, us, whose, fleetingness, was, lamented, further, rilke, in, the, poem, described, these, figures, as, standing, on, a, threadbare, carpet, to, suggest, the, ultimate, loneliness, and, isolation, of, man, in, this, incomprehensible, world, practicing, their, profession, from, childhood, to, death, as, playthings, of, an, unknown, will, before, their, pure, too, little, had, passed, into, empty, too, much, because, of, the, profound, impact, that, the, war, had, on, him, rilke, expressed, hope, that, the, task, of, the, intellectual, in, a, post, war, world, would, be, to, render, the, world, right, preparing, people, for, those, gentle, transformations, that, lead, to, a, more, serene, future, he, envisioned, the, duino, elegies, and, the, sonnets, to, orpheus, as, part, of, his, contribution, the, earliest, published, translation, of, the, duino, elegies, was, by, edward, and, vita, sackville, west, it, was, published, in, 1931, by, hogarth, press, in, england, and, titled, duineser, elegien, elegies, from, the, castle, of, duino, as, of, 2014, at, least, 24, english, language, translations, had, been, published, rilke, is, often, seen, as, a, spiritual, guide, in, popular, culture, in, the, united, states, his, poetry, has, been, read, as, wisdom, literature, and, has, been, compared, to, the, thirteenth, century, sufi, muslim, mystic, rumi, 1207, 1273, and, 20th, century, lebanese, american, poet, kahlil, gibran, 1883, 1931, in, popular, culture, rilke, is, frequently, quoted, or, referenced, in, television, programs, motion, pictures, music, and, other, works, when, these, works, discuss, the, subject, of, love, or, angels, rilke, s, works, have, also, been, appropriated, for, use, by, the, new, age, community, and, in, self, help, books, and, he, has, been, reinterpreted, as, a, master, who, can, lead, us, to, a, more, fulfilled, and, less, anxious, life, rilke, s, work, and, specifically, the, duino, elegies, have, influenced, many, poets, including, galway, kinnell, sidney, keyes, john, ashbery, and, w, h, auden, the, novelist, thomas, pynchon, novel, gravity, s, rainbow, shows, echoes, of, rilke, its, first, lines, mirror, the,

could, be, read, as, a, serio, comic, variation, on, rilke, s, duino, elegies, and, their, german, romantic, echoes, in, nazi, culture, rilke, s, duino, elegies, influenced, hans, georg, gadamer, s, theories, of, hermeneutics, understanding, how, an, observer, i, e, reader, listener, or, viewer, interprets, cultural, artifacts, i, e, works, of, literature, music, or, art, as, a, series, of, distinct, encounters, gadamer, saw, rilke, as, a, philosophical, poet, whose, work, reveals, the, limits, of, human, comprehension, he, argues, that, the, alienation, of, the, contemporary, world, stands, as, an, obstacle, to, making, sense, of, such, encounters, according, to, gadamer, rilke, s, point, toward, how, to, approach, those, limits, by, making, these, part, of, ourselves,
