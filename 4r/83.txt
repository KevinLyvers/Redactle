literary, theory, which, is, the, philosophical, analysis, of, literature, s, goals, and, methods, although, the, two, activities, are, closely, related, literary, critics, are, not, always, and, have, not, always, been, theorists, whether, or, not, literary, criticism, should, be, considered, a, separate, field, of, inquiry, from, literary, theory, is, a, matter, of, some, controversy, for, example, the, johns, hopkins, guide, to, literary, theory, and, criticism, draws, no, distinction, between, literary, theory, and, literary, criticism, and, almost, always, uses, the, terms, together, to, describe, the, same, concept, some, critics, consider, literary, criticism, a, practical, application, of, literary, theory, because, criticism, always, deals, directly, with, particular, literary, works, while, theory, may, be, more, general, or, abstract, literary, criticism, is, often, published, in, essay, or, book, form, academic, literary, critics, teach, in, literature, departments, and, publish, in, academic, journals, and, more, popular, critics, publish, their, reviews, in, broadly, circulating, periodicals, such, as, the, times, literary, supplement, the, new, york, times, book, review, the, new, york, review, of, books, the, london, review, of, books, the, dublin, review, of, books, the, nation, bookforum, and, the, new, yorker, literary, criticism, is, thought, to, have, existed, as, far, back, as, the, classical, period, in, the, 4th, century, bc, aristotle, wrote, the, poetics, a, typology, and, description, of, literary, forms, with, many, specific, criticisms, of, contemporary, works, of, art, poetics, developed, for, the, first, time, the, concepts, of, mimesis, and, catharsis, which, are, still, crucial, in, literary, studies, plato, s, attacks, on, poetry, as, imitative, secondary, and, false, were, formative, as, well, the, sanskrit, natya, shastra, includes, literary, criticism, on, ancient, indian, literature, and, sanskrit, drama, later, classical, and, medieval, criticism, often, focused, on, religious, texts, and, the, several, long, religious, traditions, of, hermeneutics, and, textual, exegesis, have, had, a, profound, influence, on, the, study, of, secular, texts, this, was, particularly, the, case, for, the, literary, traditions, of, the, three, abrahamic, religions, jewish, literature, christian, literature, and, islamic, literature, literary, criticism, was, also, employed, in, other, forms, of, medieval, arabic, literature, and, arabic, poetry, from, the, 9th, century, notably, by, al, jahiz, in, his, al, bayan, wa, l, tabyin, and, al, hayawan, and, by, abdullah, ibn, al, mu, tazz, in, his, kitab, al, badi, the, literary, criticism, of, the, renaissance, developed, classical, ideas, of, unity, of, form, and, content, into, literary, neoclassicism, proclaiming, literature, as, central, to, culture, entrusting, the, poet, and, the, author, with, preservation, of, a, long, literary, tradition, the, birth, of, renaissance, criticism, was, in, 1498, with, the, recovery, of, classic, texts, most, notably, giorgio, valla, s, latin, translation, of, aristotle, s, poetics, the, work, of, aristotle, especially, poetics, was, the, most, important, influence, upon, literary, criticism, until, the, late, eighteenth, century, lodovico, castelvetro, was, one, of, the, most, influential, renaissance, critics, who, wrote, commentaries, on, aristotle, s, poetics, in, 1570, the, seventeenth, century, witnessed, the, first, full, fledged, crisis, in, modernity, of, the, core, critical, aesthetic, principles, inherited, from, classical, antiquity, such, as, proportion, harmony, unity, decorum, that, had, long, governed, guaranteed, and, stabilized, western, thinking, about, artworks, although, classicism, was, very, far, from, spent, as, a, cultural, force, it, was, to, be, gradually, challenged, by, a, rival, movement, namely, baroque, that, favoured, the, transgressive, and, the, extreme, without, laying, claim, to, the, unity, harmony, or, decorum, that, supposedly, distinguished, both, nature, and, its, greatest, imitator, namely, ancient, art, the, key, concepts, of, the, baroque, aesthetic, such, as, conceit, concetto, wit, acutezza, ingegno, and, wonder, meraviglia, were, not, fully, developed, in, literary, theory, until, the, publication, of, emanuele, tesauro, s, il, cannocchiale, aristotelico, the, aristotelian, telescope, in, 1654, this, seminal, treatise, inspired, by, giambattista, marino, s, epic, adone, and, the, work, of, the, spanish, jesuit, philosopher, baltasar, graci, n, developed, a, theory, of, metaphor, as, a, universal, language, of, images, and, as, a, supreme, intellectual, act, at, once, an, artifice, and, an, epistemologically, privileged, mode, of, access, to, truth, in, the, enlightenment, period, 1700s, 1800s, literary, criticism, became, more, popular, during, this, time, literacy, rates, started, to, rise, in, the, public, no, longer, was, reading, exclusive, for, the, wealthy, or, scholarly, with, the, rise, of, the, literate, public, the, swiftness, of, printing, and, commercialization, of, literature, criticism, arose, too, reading, was, no, longer, viewed, solely, as, educational, or, as, a, sacred, source, of, religion, it, was, a, form, of, entertainment, literary, criticism, was, influenced, by, the, values, and, stylistic, writing, including, clear, bold, precise, writing, and, the, more, controversial, criteria, of, the, author, s, religious, beliefs, these, critical, reviews, were, published, in, many, magazines, newspapers, and, journals, the, commercialization, of, literature, and, its, mass, production, had, its, downside, the, emergent, literary, market, which, was, expected, to, educate, the, public, and, keep, them, away, from, superstition, and, prejudice, increasingly, diverged, from, the, idealistic, control, of, the, enlightenment, theoreticians, so, that, the, business, of, enlightenment, became, a, business, with, the, enlightenment, this, development, particularly, of, emergence, of, entertainment, literature, was, addressed, through, an, intensification, of, criticism, many, works, of, jonathan, swift, for, instance, were, criticized, including, his, book, gulliver, s, travels, which, one, critic, described, as, the, detestable, story, of, the, yahoos, the, british, romantic, movement, of, the, early, nineteenth, century, introduced, new, aesthetic, ideas, to, literary, studies, including, the, idea, that, the, object, of, literature, need, not, always, be, beautiful, noble, or, perfect, but, that, literature, itself, could, elevate, a, common, subject, to, the, level, of, the, sublime, german, romanticism, which, followed, closely, after, the, late, development, of, german, classicism, emphasized, an, aesthetic, of, fragmentation, that, can, appear, startlingly, modern, to, the, reader, of, english, literature, and, valued, witz, that, is, wit, or, humor, of, a, certain, sort, more, highly, than, the, serious, anglophone, romanticism, the, late, nineteenth, century, brought, renown, to, authors, known, more, for, their, literary, criticism, than, for, their, own, literary, work, such, as, matthew, arnold, however, important, all, of, these, aesthetic, movements, were, as, antecedents, current, ideas, about, literary, criticism, derive, almost, entirely, from, the, new, direction, taken, in, the, early, twentieth, century, early, in, the, century, the, school, of, criticism, known, as, russian, formalism, and, slightly, later, the, new, criticism, in, britain, and, in, the, united, states, came, to, dominate, the, study, and, discussion, of, literature, in, the, english, speaking, world, both, schools, emphasized, the, close, reading, of, texts, elevating, it, far, above, generalizing, discussion, and, speculation, about, either, authorial, intention, to, say, nothing, of, the, author, s, psychology, or, biography, which, became, almost, taboo, subjects, or, reader, response, this, emphasis, on, form, and, precise, attention, to, the, words, themselves, has, persisted, after, the, decline, of, these, critical, doctrines, themselves, in, 1957, northrop, frye, published, the, influential, anatomy, of, criticism, in, his, works, frye, noted, that, some, critics, tend, to, embrace, an, ideology, and, to, judge, literary, pieces, on, the, basis, of, their, adherence, to, such, ideology, this, has, been, a, highly, influential, viewpoint, among, modern, conservative, thinkers, e, michael, jones, for, example, argues, in, his, degenerate, moderns, that, stanley, fish, was, influenced, by, his, own, adulterous, affairs, to, reject, classic, literature, that, condemned, adultery, j, rgen, habermas, in, erkenntnis, und, interesse, knowledge, and, human, interests, described, literary, critical, theory, in, literary, studies, as, a, form, of, hermeneutics, knowledge, via, interpretation, to, understand, the, meaning, of, human, texts, and, symbolic, expressions, including, the, interpretation, of, texts, which, themselves, interpret, other, texts, in, the, british, and, american, literary, establishment, the, new, criticism, was, more, or, less, dominant, until, the, late, 1960s, around, that, time, anglo, american, university, literature, departments, began, to, witness, a, rise, of, a, more, explicitly, philosophical, literary, theory, influenced, by, structuralism, then, post, structuralism, and, other, kinds, of, continental, philosophy, it, continued, until, the, mid, 1980s, when, interest, in, theory, peaked, many, later, critics, though, undoubtedly, still, influenced, by, theoretical, work, have, been, comfortable, simply, interpreting, literature, rather, than, writing, explicitly, about, methodology, and, philosophical, presumptions, today, approaches, based, in, literary, theory, and, continental, philosophy, largely, coexist, in, university, literature, departments, while, conventional, methods, some, informed, by, the, new, critics, also, remain, active, disagreements, over, the, goals, and, methods, of, literary, criticism, which, characterized, both, sides, taken, by, critics, during, the, rise, of, theory, have, declined, some, critics, work, largely, with, theoretical, texts, while, others, read, traditional, literature, interest, in, the, literary, canon, is, still, great, but, many, critics, are, also, interested, in, nontraditional, texts, and, women, s, literature, as, elaborated, on, by, certain, academic, journals, such, as, contemporary, women, s, writing, while, some, critics, influenced, by, cultural, studies, read, popular, texts, like, comic, books, or, pulp, genre, fiction, ecocritics, have, drawn, connections, between, literature, and, the, natural, sciences, darwinian, literary, studies, studies, literature, in, the, context, of, evolutionary, influences, on, human, nature, and, postcritique, has, sought, to, develop, new, ways, of, reading, and, responding, to, literary, texts, that, go, beyond, the, interpretive, methods, of, critique, many, literary, critics, also, work, in, film, criticism, or, media, studies, related, to, other, forms, of, literary, criticism, the, history, of, the, book, is, a, field, of, interdisciplinary, inquiry, drawing, on, the, methods, of, bibliography, cultural, history, history, of, literature, and, media, theory, principally, concerned, with, the, production, circulation, and, reception, of, texts, and, their, material, forms, book, history, seeks, to, connect, forms, of, textuality, with, their, material, aspects, among, the, issues, within, the, history, of, literature, with, which, book, history, can, be, seen, to, intersect, are, the, development, of, authorship, as, a, profession, the, formation, of, reading, audiences, the, constraints, of, censorship, and, copyright, and, the, economics, of, literary, form
