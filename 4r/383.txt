blues, is, a, music, genre, and, musical, form, that, originated, amongst, african, americans, in, the, deep, south, of, the, united, states, around, the, 1860s, blues, has, incorporated, spirituals, work, songs, field, hollers, shouts, chants, and, rhymed, simple, narrative, ballads, from, the, african, american, culture, the, blues, form, is, ubiquitous, in, jazz, rhythm, and, blues, and, rock, and, roll, and, is, characterized, by, the, call, and, response, pattern, the, blues, scale, and, specific, chord, progressions, of, which, the, twelve, bar, blues, is, the, most, common, blue, notes, or, worried, notes, usually, thirds, fifths, or, sevenths, flattened, in, pitch, are, also, an, essential, part, of, the, sound, blues, shuffles, or, walking, bass, reinforce, the, trance, like, rhythm, and, form, a, repetitive, effect, known, as, the, groove, blues, music, is, characterized, by, its, lyrics, bass, lines, and, instrumentation, early, traditional, blues, verses, consisted, of, a, single, line, repeated, four, times, it, was, only, in, the, first, decades, of, the, 20th, century, that, the, most, common, current, structure, became, standard, the, aab, pattern, consisting, of, a, line, sung, over, the, four, first, bars, its, repetition, over, the, next, four, and, then, a, longer, concluding, line, over, the, last, bars, early, blues, frequently, took, the, form, of, a, loose, narrative, often, relating, the, racial, discrimination, and, other, challenges, experienced, by, african, americans, many, elements, such, as, the, call, and, response, format, and, the, use, of, blue, notes, can, be, traced, back, to, the, music, of, africa, the, origins, of, the, blues, are, also, closely, related, to, the, religious, music, of, the, african, american, community, the, spirituals, the, first, appearance, of, the, blues, is, often, dated, to, after, the, ending, of, slavery, with, the, development, of, juke, joints, occurring, later, it, is, associated, with, the, newly, acquired, freedom, of, the, former, slaves, chroniclers, began, to, report, about, blues, music, at, the, dawn, of, the, 20th, century, the, first, publication, of, blues, sheet, music, was, in, 1908, blues, has, since, evolved, from, unaccompanied, vocal, music, and, oral, traditions, of, slaves, into, a, wide, variety, of, styles, and, subgenres, blues, subgenres, include, country, blues, delta, blues, and, piedmont, blues, as, well, as, urban, blues, styles, such, as, chicago, blues, and, west, coast, blues, world, war, ii, marked, the, transition, from, acoustic, to, electric, blues, and, the, progressive, opening, of, blues, music, to, a, wider, audience, especially, white, listeners, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, a, hybrid, form, called, blues, rock, developed, which, blended, blues, styles, with, rock, music, the, term, blues, may, have, originated, from, blue, devils, meaning, melancholy, and, sadness, an, early, use, of, the, term, in, this, sense, is, in, george, colman, s, one, act, farce, blue, devils, 1798, the, phrase, blue, devils, may, also, have, been, derived, from, a, british, usage, of, the, 1600s, referring, to, the, intense, visual, hallucinations, that, can, accompany, severe, alcohol, withdrawal, as, time, went, on, the, phrase, lost, the, reference, to, devils, and, came, to, mean, a, state, of, agitation, or, depression, by, the, 1800s, in, the, united, states, the, term, blues, was, associated, with, drinking, alcohol, a, meaning, which, survives, in, the, phrase, blue, law, which, prohibits, the, sale, of, alcohol, on, sunday, in, 1827, it, was, in, the, sense, of, a, sad, state, of, mind, that, john, james, audubon, wrote, to, his, wife, that, he, had, the, blues, in, henry, david, thoreau, s, book, walden, he, mentions, the, blues, in, the, chapter, reflecting, on, his, time, in, solitude, he, wrote, his, account, of, his, personal, quest, in, 1845, although, it, was, not, published, until, 1854, the, phrase, the, blues, was, written, by, charlotte, forten, then, aged, 25, in, her, diary, on, december, 14, 1862, she, was, a, free, born, black, woman, from, pennsylvania, who, was, working, as, a, schoolteacher, in, south, carolina, instructing, both, slaves, and, freedmen, and, wrote, that, she, came, home, with, the, blues, because, she, felt, lonesome, and, pitied, herself, she, overcame, her, depression, and, later, noted, a, number, of, songs, such, as, poor, rosy, that, were, popular, among, the, slaves, although, she, admitted, being, unable, to, describe, the, manner, of, singing, she, heard, forten, wrote, that, the, songs, can, t, be, sung, without, a, full, heart, and, a, troubled, spirit, conditions, that, have, inspired, countless, blues, songs, though, the, use, of, the, phrase, in, african, american, music, may, be, older, it, has, been, attested, to, in, print, since, 1912, when, hart, wand, s, dallas, blues, became, the, first, copyrighted, blues, composition, in, lyrics, the, phrase, is, often, used, to, describe, a, depressed, mood, early, traditional, blues, verses, often, consisted, of, a, single, line, repeated, four, times, however, the, most, common, structure, of, blues, lyrics, today, was, established, in, the, first, few, decades, of, the, 20th, century, known, as, the, aab, pattern, this, structure, consists, of, a, line, sung, over, the, first, four, bars, its, repetition, over, the, next, four, and, a, longer, concluding, line, over, the, last, bars, this, pattern, can, be, heard, in, some, of, the, first, published, blues, songs, such, as, dallas, blues, 1912, and, saint, louis, blues, 1914, according, to, w, c, handy, the, aab, pattern, was, adopted, to, avoid, the, monotony, of, lines, repeated, three, times, the, lyrics, are, often, sung, in, a, rhythmic, talk, style, rather, than, a, melody, resembling, a, form, of, talking, blues, early, blues, frequently, took, the, form, of, a, loose, narrative, african, american, singers, voiced, their, personal, woes, in, a, world, of, harsh, reality, a, lost, love, the, cruelty, of, police, officers, oppression, at, the, hands, of, white, folk, hard, times, this, melancholy, has, led, to, the, suggestion, of, an, igbo, origin, for, blues, because, of, the, reputation, the, igbo, had, throughout, plantations, in, the, americas, for, their, melancholic, music, and, outlook, on, life, when, they, were, enslaved, other, historians, have, argued, that, there, is, little, evidence, of, sub, sahelian, influence, in, the, blues, as, elaborate, polyrhythm, percussion, on, african, drums, as, opposed, to, european, drums, collective, participation, which, are, characteristic, of, west, central, african, music, below, the, savannah, are, conspicuously, absent, according, to, the, historian, paul, oliver, the, roots, of, the, blues, were, not, to, be, found, in, the, coastal, and, forest, regions, of, africa, rather, the, blues, was, rooted, in, the, savanna, hinterland, from, senegambia, through, mali, burkina, faso, northern, ghana, niger, and, northern, nigeria, additionally, ethnomusicologist, john, storm, roberts, has, argued, that, the, parallels, between, african, savanna, belt, string, playing, and, the, techniques, of, many, blues, guitarists, are, remarkable, the, big, kora, of, senegal, and, guinea, are, played, in, a, rhythmic, melodic, style, that, uses, constantly, changing, rhythms, often, providing, a, ground, bass, overlaid, with, complex, treble, patterns, while, vocal, supplies, a, third, rhythmic, layer, similar, techniques, can, be, found, in, hundreds, of, blues, records, the, lyrics, often, relate, troubles, experienced, within, african, american, society, for, instance, blind, lemon, jefferson, s, rising, high, water, blues, 1927, tells, of, the, great, mississippi, flood, of, 1927, backwater, rising, southern, peoples, can, t, make, no, time, i, said, backwater, rising, southern, peoples, can, t, make, no, time, and, i, can, t, get, no, hearing, from, that, memphis, girl, of, mine, although, the, blues, gained, an, association, with, misery, and, oppression, the, lyrics, could, also, be, humorous, and, raunchy, rebecca, rebecca, get, your, big, legs, off, of, me, rebecca, rebecca, get, your, big, legs, off, of, me, it, may, be, sending, you, baby, but, it, s, worrying, the, hell, out, of, me, hokum, blues, celebrated, both, comedic, lyrical, content, and, a, boisterous, farcical, performance, style, tampa, red, and, georgia, tom, s, it, s, tight, like, that, 1928, is, a, sly, wordplay, with, the, double, meaning, of, being, tight, with, someone, coupled, with, a, more, salacious, physical, familiarity, blues, songs, with, sexually, explicit, lyrics, were, known, as, dirty, blues, the, lyrical, content, became, slightly, simpler, in, postwar, blues, which, tended, to, focus, on, relationship, woes, or, sexual, worries, lyrical, themes, that, frequently, appeared, in, prewar, blues, such, as, economic, depression, farming, devils, gambling, magic, floods, and, drought, were, less, common, in, postwar, blues, the, writer, ed, morales, claimed, that, yoruba, mythology, played, a, part, in, early, blues, citing, robert, johnson, s, cross, road, blues, as, a, thinly, veiled, reference, to, eleggua, the, orisha, in, charge, of, the, crossroads, however, the, christian, influence, was, far, more, obvious, the, repertoires, of, many, seminal, blues, artists, such, as, charley, patton, and, skip, james, included, religious, songs, or, spirituals, reverend, gary, davis, and, blind, willie, johnson, are, examples, of, artists, often, categorized, as, blues, musicians, for, their, music, although, their, lyrics, clearly, belong, to, spirituals, the, blues, form, is, a, cyclic, musical, form, in, which, a, repeating, progression, of, chords, mirrors, the, call, and, response, scheme, commonly, found, in, african, and, african, american, music, during, the, first, decades, of, the, 20th, century, blues, music, was, not, clearly, defined, in, terms, of, a, particular, chord, progression, with, the, popularity, of, early, performers, such, as, bessie, smith, use, of, the, twelve, bar, blues, spread, across, the, music, industry, during, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, other, chord, progressions, such, as, 8, bar, forms, are, still, considered, blues, examples, include, how, long, blues, trouble, in, mind, and, big, bill, broonzy, s, key, to, the, highway, there, are, also, 16, bar, blues, such, as, ray, charles, s, instrumental, sweet, 16, bars, and, herbie, hancock, s, watermelon, man, idiosyncratic, numbers, of, bars, are, occasionally, used, such, as, the, 9, bar, progression, in, sitting, on, top, of, the, world, by, walter, vinson, the, basic, 12, bar, lyric, framework, of, many, blues, compositions, is, reflected, by, a, standard, harmonic, progression, of, 12, bars, in, a, 4, 4, time, signature, the, blues, chords, associated, to, a, twelve, bar, blues, are, typically, a, set, of, three, different, chords, played, over, a, 12, bar, scheme, they, are, labeled, by, roman, numbers, referring, to, the, degrees, of, the, progression, for, instance, for, a, blues, in, the, key, of, c, c, is, the, tonic, chord, i, and, f, is, the, subdominant, iv, the, last, chord, is, the, dominant, v, turnaround, marking, the, transition, to, the, beginning, of, the, next, progression, the, lyrics, generally, end, on, the, last, beat, of, the, tenth, bar, or, the, first, beat, of, the, 11th, bar, and, the, final, two, bars, are, given, to, the, instrumentalist, as, a, break, the, harmony, of, this, two, bar, break, the, turnaround, can, be, extremely, complex, sometimes, consisting, of, single, notes, that, defy, analysis, in, terms, of, chords, much, of, the, time, some, or, all, of, these, chords, are, played, in, the, harmonic, seventh, 7th, form, the, use, of, the, harmonic, seventh, interval, is, characteristic, of, blues, and, is, popularly, called, the, blues, seven, blues, seven, chords, add, to, the, harmonic, chord, a, note, with, a, frequency, in, a, 7, 4, ratio, to, the, fundamental, note, at, a, 7, 4, ratio, it, is, not, close, to, any, interval, on, the, conventional, western, diatonic, scale, for, convenience, or, by, necessity, it, is, often, approximated, by, a, minor, seventh, interval, or, a, dominant, seventh, chord, in, melody, blues, is, distinguished, by, the, use, of, the, flattened, third, fifth, and, seventh, of, the, associated, major, scale, blues, shuffles, or, walking, bass, reinforce, the, trance, like, rhythm, and, call, and, response, and, they, form, a, repetitive, effect, called, a, groove, characteristic, of, the, blues, since, its, afro, american, origins, the, shuffles, played, a, central, role, in, swing, music, the, simplest, shuffles, which, were, the, clearest, signature, of, the, r, b, wave, that, started, in, the, mid, 1940s, were, a, three, note, riff, on, the, bass, strings, of, the, guitar, when, this, riff, was, played, over, the, bass, and, the, drums, the, groove, feel, was, created, shuffle, rhythm, is, often, vocalized, as, dow, da, dow, da, dow, da, or, dump, da, dump, da, dump, da, it, consists, of, uneven, or, swung, eighth, notes, on, a, guitar, this, may, be, played, as, a, simple, steady, bass, or, it, may, add, to, that, stepwise, quarter, note, motion, from, the, fifth, to, the, sixth, of, the, chord, and, back, hart, wand, s, dallas, blues, was, published, in, 1912, w, c, handy, s, the, memphis, blues, followed, in, the, same, year, the, first, recording, by, an, african, american, singer, was, mamie, smith, s, 1920, rendition, of, perry, bradford, s, crazy, blues, but, the, origins, of, the, blues, were, some, decades, earlier, probably, around, 1890, this, music, is, poorly, documented, partly, because, of, racial, discrimination, in, u, s, society, including, academic, circles, and, partly, because, of, the, low, rate, of, literacy, among, rural, african, americans, at, the, time, reports, of, blues, music, in, southern, texas, and, the, deep, south, were, written, at, the, dawn, of, the, 20th, century, charles, peabody, mentioned, the, appearance, of, blues, music, at, clarksdale, mississippi, and, gate, thomas, reported, similar, songs, in, southern, texas, around, 1901, 1902, these, observations, coincide, more, or, less, with, the, recollections, of, jelly, roll, morton, who, said, he, first, heard, blues, music, in, new, orleans, in, 1902, ma, rainey, who, remembered, first, hearing, the, blues, in, the, same, year, in, missouri, and, w, c, handy, who, first, heard, the, blues, in, tutwiler, mississippi, in, 1903, the, first, extensive, research, in, the, field, was, performed, by, howard, w, odum, who, published, an, anthology, of, folk, songs, from, lafayette, county, mississippi, and, newton, county, georgia, between, 1905, and, 1908, the, first, non, commercial, recordings, of, blues, music, termed, proto, blues, by, paul, oliver, were, made, by, odum, for, research, purposes, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, they, are, now, lost, other, recordings, that, are, still, available, were, made, in, 1924, by, lawrence, gellert, later, several, recordings, were, made, by, robert, w, gordon, who, became, head, of, the, archive, of, american, folk, songs, of, the, library, of, congress, gordon, s, successor, at, the, library, was, john, lomax, in, the, 1930s, lomax, and, his, son, alan, made, a, large, number, of, non, commercial, blues, recordings, that, testify, to, the, huge, variety, of, proto, blues, styles, such, as, field, hollers, and, ring, shouts, a, record, of, blues, music, as, it, existed, before, 1920, can, also, be, found, in, the, recordings, of, artists, such, as, lead, belly, and, henry, thomas, all, these, sources, show, the, existence, of, many, different, structures, distinct, from, twelve, eight, or, sixteen, bar, the, social, and, economic, reasons, for, the, appearance, of, the, blues, are, not, fully, known, the, first, appearance, of, the, blues, is, usually, dated, after, the, emancipation, act, of, 1863, between, 1860s, and, 1890s, a, period, that, coincides, with, post, emancipation, and, later, the, establishment, of, juke, joints, as, places, where, african, americans, went, to, listen, to, music, dance, or, gamble, after, a, hard, day, s, work, this, period, corresponds, to, the, transition, from, slavery, to, sharecropping, small, scale, agricultural, production, and, the, expansion, of, railroads, in, the, southern, united, states, several, scholars, characterize, the, development, of, blues, music, in, the, early, 1900s, as, a, move, from, group, performance, to, individualized, performance, they, argue, that, the, development, of, the, blues, is, associated, with, the, newly, acquired, freedom, of, the, enslaved, people, according, to, lawrence, levine, there, was, a, direct, relationship, between, the, national, ideological, emphasis, upon, the, individual, the, popularity, of, booker, t, washington, s, teachings, and, the, rise, of, the, blues, levine, stated, that, psychologically, socially, and, economically, african, americans, were, being, acculturated, in, a, way, that, would, have, been, impossible, during, slavery, and, it, is, hardly, surprising, that, their, secular, music, reflected, this, as, much, as, their, religious, music, did, there, are, few, characteristics, common, to, all, blues, music, because, the, genre, took, its, shape, from, the, idiosyncrasies, of, individual, performers, however, there, are, some, characteristics, that, were, present, long, before, the, creation, of, the, modern, blues, call, and, response, shouts, were, an, early, form, of, blues, like, music, they, were, a, functional, expression, style, without, accompaniment, or, harmony, and, unbounded, by, the, formality, of, any, particular, musical, structure, a, form, of, this, pre, blues, was, heard, in, slave, ring, shouts, and, field, hollers, expanded, into, simple, solo, songs, laden, with, emotional, content, blues, has, evolved, from, the, unaccompanied, vocal, music, and, oral, traditions, of, slaves, imported, from, west, africa, and, rural, blacks, into, a, wide, variety, of, styles, and, subgenres, with, regional, variations, across, the, united, states, although, blues, as, it, is, now, known, can, be, seen, as, a, musical, style, based, on, both, european, harmonic, structure, and, the, african, call, and, response, tradition, that, transformed, into, an, interplay, of, voice, and, guitar, the, blues, form, itself, bears, no, resemblance, to, the, melodic, styles, of, the, west, african, griots, additionally, there, are, theories, that, the, four, beats, per, measure, structure, of, the, blues, might, have, its, origins, in, the, native, american, tradition, of, pow, wow, drumming, some, scholars, identify, strong, influences, on, the, blues, from, the, melodic, structures, of, certain, west, african, musical, styles, of, the, savanna, and, sahel, lucy, durran, finds, similarities, with, the, melodies, of, the, bambara, people, and, to, a, lesser, degree, the, soninke, people, and, wolof, people, but, not, as, much, of, the, mandinka, people, gerard, kubik, finds, similarities, to, the, melodic, styles, of, both, the, west, african, savanna, and, central, africa, both, of, which, were, sources, of, enslaved, people, no, specific, african, musical, form, can, be, identified, as, the, single, direct, ancestor, of, the, blues, however, the, call, and, response, format, can, be, traced, back, to, the, music, of, africa, that, blue, notes, predate, their, use, in, blues, and, have, an, african, origin, is, attested, to, by, a, negro, love, song, by, the, english, composer, samuel, coleridge, taylor, from, his, african, suite, for, piano, written, in, 1898, which, contains, blue, third, and, seventh, notes, the, diddley, bow, a, homemade, one, stringed, instrument, found, in, parts, of, the, american, south, sometimes, referred, to, as, a, jitterbug, or, a, one, string, in, the, early, twentieth, century, and, the, banjo, are, african, derived, instruments, that, may, have, helped, in, the, transfer, of, african, performance, techniques, into, the, early, blues, instrumental, vocabulary, the, banjo, seems, to, be, directly, imported, from, west, african, music, it, is, similar, to, the, musical, instrument, that, griots, and, other, africans, such, as, the, igbo, played, called, halam, or, akonting, by, african, peoples, such, as, the, wolof, fula, and, mandinka, however, in, the, 1920s, when, country, blues, began, to, be, recorded, the, use, of, the, banjo, in, blues, music, was, quite, marginal, and, limited, to, individuals, such, as, papa, charlie, jackson, and, later, gus, cannon, blues, music, also, adopted, elements, from, the, ethiopian, airs, minstrel, shows, and, negro, spirituals, including, instrumental, and, harmonic, accompaniment, the, style, also, was, closely, related, to, ragtime, which, developed, at, about, the, same, time, though, the, blues, better, preserved, the, original, melodic, patterns, of, african, music, the, musical, forms, and, styles, that, are, now, considered, the, blues, as, well, as, modern, country, music, arose, in, the, same, regions, of, the, southern, united, states, during, the, 19th, century, recorded, blues, and, country, music, can, be, found, as, far, back, as, the, 1920s, when, the, record, industry, created, the, marketing, categories, race, music, and, hillbilly, music, to, sell, music, by, blacks, for, blacks, and, by, whites, for, whites, respectively, at, the, time, there, was, no, clear, musical, division, between, blues, and, country, except, for, the, ethnicity, of, the, performer, and, even, that, was, sometimes, documented, incorrectly, by, record, companies, though, musicologists, can, now, attempt, to, define, the, blues, narrowly, in, terms, of, certain, chord, structures, and, lyric, forms, thought, to, have, originated, in, west, africa, audiences, originally, heard, the, music, in, a, far, more, general, way, it, was, simply, the, music, of, the, rural, south, notably, the, mississippi, delta, black, and, white, musicians, shared, the, same, repertoire, and, thought, of, themselves, as, songsters, rather, than, blues, musicians, the, notion, of, blues, as, a, separate, genre, arose, during, the, black, migration, from, the, countryside, to, urban, areas, in, the, 1920s, and, the, simultaneous, development, of, the, recording, industry, blues, became, a, code, word, for, a, record, designed, to, sell, to, black, listeners, the, origins, of, the, blues, are, closely, related, to, the, religious, music, of, afro, american, community, the, spirituals, the, origins, of, spirituals, go, back, much, further, than, the, blues, usually, dating, back, to, the, middle, of, the, 18th, century, when, the, slaves, were, christianized, and, began, to, sing, and, play, christian, hymns, in, particular, those, of, isaac, watts, which, were, very, popular, before, the, blues, gained, its, formal, definition, in, terms, of, chord, progressions, it, was, defined, as, the, secular, counterpart, of, spirituals, it, was, the, low, down, music, played, by, rural, blacks, depending, on, the, religious, community, a, musician, belonged, to, it, was, more, or, less, considered, a, sin, to, play, this, low, down, music, blues, was, the, devil, s, music, musicians, were, therefore, segregated, into, two, categories, gospel, singers, and, blues, singers, guitar, preachers, and, songsters, however, when, rural, black, music, began, to, be, recorded, in, the, 1920s, both, categories, of, musicians, used, similar, techniques, call, and, response, patterns, blue, notes, and, slide, guitars, gospel, music, was, nevertheless, using, musical, forms, that, were, compatible, with, christian, hymns, and, therefore, less, marked, by, the, blues, form, than, its, secular, counterpart, the, american, sheet, music, publishing, industry, produced, a, great, deal, of, ragtime, music, by, 1912, the, sheet, music, industry, had, published, three, popular, blues, like, compositions, precipitating, the, tin, pan, alley, adoption, of, blues, elements, baby, seals, blues, by, baby, franklin, seals, arranged, by, artie, matthews, dallas, blues, by, hart, wand, and, the, memphis, blues, by, w, c, handy, handy, was, a, formally, trained, musician, composer, and, arranger, who, helped, to, popularize, the, blues, by, transcribing, and, orchestrating, blues, in, an, almost, symphonic, style, with, bands, and, singers, he, became, a, popular, and, prolific, composer, and, billed, himself, as, the, father, of, the, blues, however, his, compositions, can, be, described, as, a, fusion, of, blues, with, ragtime, and, jazz, a, merger, facilitated, using, the, cuban, habanera, rhythm, that, had, long, been, a, part, of, ragtime, handy, s, signature, work, was, the, saint, louis, blues, in, the, 1920s, the, blues, became, a, major, element, of, african, american, and, american, popular, music, also, reaching, white, audiences, via, handy, s, arrangements, and, the, classic, female, blues, performers, these, female, performers, became, perhaps, the,
