was, living, in, paris, on, rue, des, grands, augustins, he, was, commissioned, by, the, spanish, republican, government, to, create, a, large, mural, for, the, spanish, pavilion, at, the, 1937, paris, world, s, fair, this, piece, was, to, help, raise, awareness, of, the, war, and, raise, necessary, funds, picasso, who, had, last, visited, spain, in, 1934, and, would, never, return, was, the, honorary, director, in, exile, of, the, prado, museum, picasso, worked, somewhat, dispassionately, from, january, until, late, april, on, the, project, s, initial, sketches, which, depicted, his, perennial, theme, of, an, artist, s, studio, then, immediately, upon, hearing, reports, of, the, 26, april, bombing, of, guernica, poet, juan, larrea, visited, picasso, s, home, to, urge, him, to, make, the, bombing, his, subject, days, later, on, 1, may, picasso, read, george, steer, s, eyewitness, account, of, the, attack, which, originally, had, been, published, in, both, the, times, and, the, new, york, times, on, 28, april, and, abandoned, his, initial, idea, acting, on, larrea, s, suggestion, picasso, began, sketching, a, series, of, preliminary, drawings, for, guernica, during, the, spanish, civil, war, the, republican, forces, made, up, of, communists, socialists, anarchists, and, others, with, differing, goals, united, in, their, opposition, to, the, nationalists, led, by, general, francisco, franco, who, sought, to, establish, a, fascist, dictatorship, the, nationalists, perceived, guernica, a, quiet, village, in, the, province, of, biscay, in, basque, country, as, the, northern, bastion, of, the, republican, resistance, movement, and, the, center, of, basque, culture, on, monday, 26, april, 1937, warplanes, of, the, nazi, germany, condor, legion, commanded, by, colonel, wolfram, von, richthofen, bombed, guernica, for, about, two, hours, in, his, 30, april, 1937, journal, entry, von, richthofen, noted, that, when, the, squadron, arrived, there, was, smoke, everywhere, from, the, attack, by, three, aircraft, and, since, nobody, could, see, the, roads, bridges, and, suburbs, they, just, dropped, everything, right, into, the, center, the, 250s, toppled, a, number, of, houses, and, destroyed, the, water, mains, the, incendiaries, now, could, spread, and, become, effective, the, materials, of, the, houses, tile, roofs, wooden, porches, and, half, timbering, resulted, in, complete, annihilation, monday, was, guernica, s, market, day, and, many, of, its, inhabitants, were, congregated, in, the, center, of, town, when, the, main, bombardment, began, the, roads, were, already, full, of, debris, and, the, bridges, leading, out, of, town, destroyed, and, they, were, unable, to, escape, guernica, the, capital, of, biscay, was, 10, kilometers, from, the, front, lines, and, in, between, the, front, lines, and, bilbao, a, republican, retreat, towards, bilbao, or, an, advance, towards, it, had, to, pass, through, it, richthofen, s, 26, april, 1937, diary, entry, states, guernica, was, targeted, to, halt, and, disrupt, the, red, withdrawal, which, has, to, pass, through, here, the, following, day, richthofen, wrote, in, his, diary, guernica, burning, the, nearest, actual, military, target, a, war, product, factory, on, the, village, s, outskirts, went, through, the, attack, unscathed, so, the, attack, was, widely, condemned, as, a, terror, bombing, most, of, guernica, s, men, were, away, fighting, on, behalf, of, the, republicans, and, at, the, time, of, the, bombing, the, town, was, populated, mostly, by, women, and, children, as, reflected, in, picasso, s, painting, art, theorist, rudolf, arnheim, writes, the, women, and, children, make, guernica, the, image, of, innocent, defenseless, humanity, victimized, also, women, and, children, have, often, been, presented, by, picasso, as, the, very, perfection, of, mankind, an, assault, on, women, and, children, is, in, picasso, s, view, directed, at, the, core, of, mankind, the, times, journalist, george, steer, propelled, this, event, onto, the, international, scene, and, brought, it, to, pablo, picasso, s, attention, in, an, eyewitness, account, published, on, 28, april, in, both, the, times, and, the, new, york, times, on, the, 29th, it, appeared, in, l, humanit, steer, wrote, guernica, the, most, ancient, town, of, the, basques, and, the, centre, of, their, cultural, tradition, was, completely, destroyed, yesterday, afternoon, by, insurgent, air, raiders, the, bombardment, of, this, open, town, far, behind, the, lines, occupied, precisely, three, hours, and, a, quarter, during, which, a, powerful, fleet, of, aeroplanes, consisting, of, three, types, of, german, types, junkers, and, heinkel, bombers, did, not, cease, unloading, on, the, town, bombs, weighing, from, 1, 000, lbs, downwards, and, it, is, calculated, more, than, 3, 000, two, pounder, aluminium, incendiary, projectiles, the, fighters, meanwhile, plunged, low, from, above, the, centre, of, the, town, to, machinegun, those, of, the, civilian, population, who, had, taken, refuge, in, the, fields, picasso, lived, in, paris, during, its, world, war, ii, german, occupation, a, widely, repeated, story, is, that, a, german, officer, saw, a, photo, of, guernica, in, picasso, s, apartment, and, asked, did, you, do, that, and, picasso, responded, no, you, did, on, 11, may, the, canvas, is, ready, and, immediately, the, composition, is, laid, down, as, a, linear, structure, that, covers, the, whole, surface, work, on, the, mural, is, accompanied, by, more, than, thirty, studies, for, the, details, the, rough, plan, exists, from, the, beginning, but, it, takes, three, weeks, before, the, picture, receives, its, final, form, the, bull, s, head, remains, where, it, was, first, put, but, the, body, is, turned, around, to, the, left, on, 20, may, the, horse, lifts, its, head, the, body, of, the, soldier, stretched, on, the, floor, from, left, to, right, changes, position, on, 4, june, then, head, and, hand, take, on, their, finished, shape, at, the, last, moment, the, artist, makes, one, decisive, adjustment, the, drama, first, took, place, on, a, street, with, burning, houses, in, the, background, now, suddenly, the, diagonals, are, accentuated, and, thereby, space, becomes, ambiguous, unreal, inside, and, outside, at, the, same, time, the, lamp, is, hung, over, the, horse, s, head, looking, on, the, dreadful, scene, like, a, wide, open, eye, the, construction, is, strengthened, the, mural, more, strongly, integrated, within, sert, s, architecture, into, the, hand, of, the, dying, soldier, next, to, the, broken, sword, picasso, puts, the, little, flower, of, hope, the, picture, was, finished, about, mid, june, hundreds, of, thousands, of, exhibition, goers, wandered, by, looking, on, it, as, a, wall, decoration, just, as, europe, wandered, by, the, human, drama, of, the, spanish, civil, war, as, if, it, were, a, matter, concerning, only, the, inhabitants, of, the, peninsula, they, disregarded, the, warning, did, not, understand, that, democracy, on, the, whole, continent, was, at, stake, w, j, h, b, sandberg, daedalus, 1960, dora, maar, found, a, large, enough, studio, for, picasso, to, paint, guernica, in, through, her, connections, in, the, left, wing, community, she, gained, access, to, a, space, on, rue, des, grands, augustins, near, notre, dame, this, building, had, previously, served, as, the, headquarters, of, the, contre, attaque, group, of, which, maar, was, a, dedicated, member, having, listened, to, anti, fascist, speeches, there, she, recognized, it, as, the, ideal, location, for, picasso, s, monumental, protest, artwork, not, only, did, she, find, the, studio, large, enough, for, picasso, to, paint, guernica, in, she, also, had, exclusive, access, to, photograph, the, work, in, progress, maar, s, practice, of, photography, influenced, the, art, of, picasso, she, had, a, great, influence, on, his, work, said, antoine, romand, a, dora, maar, expert, she, contested, him, she, pushed, him, to, do, something, new, and, to, be, more, creative, politically, at, picasso, s, request, maar, painted, part, of, the, dying, horse, in, guernica, maar, accompanied, picasso, in, the, studio, giving, her, the, opportunity, to, observe, each, phase, of, guernica, s, creation, over, 36, days, while, picasso, painted, she, took, photographs, turning, picasso, into, her, photographic, subject, scholars, and, art, critics, argue, that, the, black, and, white, photographic, style, of, the, painting, can, be, attributed, to, maar, s, own, black, and, white, photographs, in, stark, contrast, to, picasso, s, usual, colorful, style, guernica, was, painted, using, a, matte, house, paint, specially, formulated, at, picasso, s, request, to, have, the, least, possible, gloss, american, artist, john, ferren, assisted, him, in, preparing, the, monumental, canvas, and, photographer, dora, maar, who, had, been, working, with, picasso, since, mid, 1936, photographing, his, studio, and, teaching, him, the, technique, of, cameraless, photography, documented, its, creation, apart, from, their, documentary, and, publicity, value, maar, s, photographs, helped, picasso, to, eschew, color, and, give, the, work, the, black, and, white, immediacy, of, a, photograph, according, to, art, historian, john, richardson, picasso, who, rarely, allowed, strangers, into, his, studio, to, watch, him, work, admitted, influential, visitors, to, observe, his, progress, on, guernica, believing, that, the, publicity, would, help, the, antifascist, cause, as, his, work, on, the, mural, progressed, picasso, explained, the, spanish, struggle, is, the, fight, of, reaction, against, the, people, against, freedom, my, whole, life, as, an, artist, has, been, nothing, more, than, a, continuous, struggle, against, reaction, and, the, death, of, art, how, could, anybody, think, for, a, moment, that, i, could, be, in, agreement, with, reaction, and, death, in, the, panel, on, which, i, am, working, which, i, shall, call, guernica, and, in, all, my, recent, works, of, art, i, clearly, express, my, abhorrence, of, the, military, caste, which, has, sunk, spain, in, an, ocean, of, pain, and, death, picasso, worked, on, the, painting, for, 35, days, and, finished, it, on, 4, june, 1937, the, scene, occurs, within, a, large, room, on, the, left, a, wide, eyed, bull, with, a, tail, suggesting, rising, flame, and, smoke, as, if, seen, through, a, window, stands, over,

marks, arranged, in, rows, a, dead, and, dismembered, soldier, lies, under, the, horse, the, hand, of, his, severed, right, arm, grasps, a, shattered, sword, from, which, a, flower, grows, the, open, palm, of, his, left, hand, contains, a, stigma, a, symbol, of, martyrdom, derived, from, the, stigmata, of, christ, a, bare, light, bulb, in, the, shape, of, an, all, seeing, eye, blazes, over, the, suffering, horse, s, head, to, the, horse, s, upper, right, a, frightened, woman, s, head, and, extended, right, arm, reach, through, a, window, as, she, witnesses, the, scene, she, carries, a, flame, lit, lamp, in, her, right, hand, and, holds, it, near, the, bare, bulb, below, her, a, woman, in, shock, staggers, from, the, right, towards, the, center, while, looking, into, the, blazing, light, bulb, with, a, blank, stare, daggers, that, suggest, screaming, have, replaced, the, tongues, of, the, horse, the, bull, and, the, grieving, woman, to, the, bull, s, right, a, dove, appears, on, a, cracked, wall, through, which, bright, light, from, the, outside, shines, on, the, far, right, of, the, room, there, is, a, fourth, woman, her, arms, raised, in, terror, her, wide, open, mouth, and,

leg, which, has, the, knee, on, the, ground, the, leg, s, knee, cap, forms, the, head, s, nose, a, horn, appears, within, the, horse, s, breast, interpretations, of, guernica, vary, widely, and, contradict, one, another, this, extends, for, example, to, the, mural, s, two, dominant, elements, the, bull, and, the, horse, art, historian, patricia, failing, said, the, bull, and, the, horse, are, important, characters, in, spanish, culture, picasso, himself, certainly, used, these, characters, to, play, many, different, roles, over, time, this, has, made, the, task, of, interpreting, the, specific, meaning, of, the, bull, and, the, horse, very, tough, their, relationship, is, a, kind, of, ballet, that, was, conceived, in, a, variety, of, ways, throughout, picasso, s, career, when, pressed, to, explain, the, elements, in, guernica, picasso, said, this, bull, is, a, bull, and, this, horse, is, a, horse, if, you, give, a, meaning, to, certain, things, in, my, paintings, it, may, be, very, true, but, it, is, not, my, idea, to, give, this, meaning, what, ideas, and, conclusions, you, have, got, i, obtained, too, but, instinctively, unconsciously, i, make, the, painting, for, the, painting, i, paint, the, objects, for, what, they, are, in, the, dream, and, lie, of, franco, a, series, of, narrative, sketches, picasso, also, created, for, the, world, s, fair, franco, is, depicted, as, a, monster, that, first, devours, his, own, horse, and, later, does, battle, with, an, angry, bull, work, on, these, illustrations, began, before, the, bombing, of, guernica, and, four, additional, panels, were, added, three, of, which, relate, directly, to, the, guernica, mural, according, to, scholar, beverly, ray, the, following, list, of, interpretations, reflects, the, general, consensus, of, historians, the, shape, and, posture, of, the, bodies, express, protest, picasso, uses, black, white, and, grey, paint, to, set, a, somber, mood, and, express, pain, and, chaos, flaming, buildings, and, crumbling, walls, not, only, express, the, destruction, of, guernica, but, reflect, the, destructive, power, of, civil, war, the, newspaper, print, used, in, the, painting, reflects, how, picasso, learned, of, the, massacre, the, light, bulb, in, the, painting, represents, the, sun, and, the, broken, sword, near, the, bottom, of, the, painting, symbolizes, the, defeat, of, the, people, at, the, hand, of, their, tormentors, alejandro, escalona, said, the, chaos, unfolding, seems, to, happen, in, closed, quarters, provoking, an, intense, feeling, of, oppression, there, is, no, way, out, of, the, nightmarish, cityscape, the, absence, of, color, makes, the, violent, scene, developing, right, before, your, eyes, even, more, horrifying, the, blacks, whites, and, grays, startle, you, especially, because, you, are, used, to, see, war, images, broadcast, live, and, in, high, definition, right, to, your, living, room, in, drawing, attention, to, a, number, of, preliminary, studies, the, so, called, primary, project, that, show, an, atelier, installation, incorporating, the, central, triangular, shape, which, reappears, in, the, final, version, of, guernica, becht, j, rdens, and, wehmeier, interpret, the, painting, as, a, self, referential, composition, in, the, tradition, of, atelier, paintings, such, as, las, meninas, by, diego, vel, zquez, in, his, chef, d, oeuvre, picasso, seems, to, be, trying, to, define, his, role, and, his, power, as, an, artist, in, the, face, of, political, power, and, violence, but, far, from, being, a, mere, political, painting, guernica, should, be, seen, as, picasso, s, comment, on, what, art, can, actually, contribute, towards, the, self, assertion, that, liberates, every, human, being, and, protects, the, individual, against, overwhelming, forces, such, as, political, crime, war, violence, and, death, guernica, was, unveiled, and, initially, exhibited, in, july, 1937, at, the, spanish, pavilion, at, the, paris, international, exposition, where, nazi, germany, and, the, soviet, union, had, huge, pavilions, the, pavilion, which, was, financed, by, the, spanish, republican, government, at, the, time, of, civil, war, was, built, to, exhibit, the, spanish, government, s, struggle, for, existence, contrary, to, the, exposition, s, technology, theme, the, pavilion, s, entrance, presented, an, enormous, photographic, mural, of, republican, soldiers, accompanied, by, the, slogan, the, display, of, guernica, was, accompanied, by, a, poem, by, paul, luard, and, the, pavilion, displayed, the, reaper, by, joan, mir, and, mercury, fountain, by, alexander, calder, both, of, whom, were, sympathetic, to, the, republican, cause, at, guernica, s, paris, exhibition, unveiling, it, garnered, little, attention, the, public, s, reaction, to, the, painting, was, mixed, max, aub, one, of, the, officials, in, charge, of, the, spanish, pavilion, was, compelled, to, defend, the, work, against, a, group, of, spanish, officials, who, objected, to, the, mural, s, modernist, style, and, sought, to, replace, it, with, a, more, traditional, painting, that, was, also, commissioned, for, the, exhibition, madrid, 1937, black, aeroplanes, by, horacio, ferrer, de, morgado, some, marxist, groups, criticized, picasso, s, painting, as, lacking, in, political, commitment, and, faulted, it, for, not, offering, a, vision, of, a, better, future, in, contrast, morgado, s, painting, was, a, great, success, with, spanish, communists, and, with, the, public, the, art, critic, clement, greenberg, was, also, critical, of, guernica, and, in, a, later, essay, he, termed, the, painting, jerky, and, too, compressed, for, its, size, and, compared, it, unfavorably, to, the, magnificently, lyrical, the, charnel, house, 1944, 1948, a, later, antiwar, painting, by, picasso, among, the, painting, s, admirers, were, art, critic, jean, cassou, and, poet, jos, bergam, n, both, of, whom, praised, the, painting, as, quintessentially, spanish, michel, leiris, perceived, in, guernica, a, foreshadowing, on, a, black, and, white, canvas, that, depicts, ancient, tragedy, picasso, also, writes, our, letter, of, doom, all, that, we, love, is, going, to, be, lost, jean, cocteau, also, praised, the, painting, and, declared, it, a, cross, that, franco, would, always, carry, on, his, shoulder, possibly, as, a, riposte, to, picasso, s, painting, the, nazis, in, june, or, july, 1937, commissioned, their, official, war, artist, claus, bergen, to, produce, a, patriotic, painting, of, the, bombardment, of, almeria, by, the, admiral, scheer, national, maritime, museum, london, the, work, done, in, a, realistic, style, was, completed, quickly, for, display, in, the, great, german, art, exhibition, in, munich, 1937, guernica, for, which, picasso, was, paid, 150, 000, francs, for, his, costs, by, the, spanish, republican, government, was, one, of, the, few, major, paintings, that, picasso, did, not, sell, directly, to, his, exclusive, contracted, art, dealer, and, friend, paul, rosenberg, however, after, its, exhibition, rosenberg, organised, a, four, man, extravaganza, scandinavian, tour, of, 118, works, by, picasso, matisse, braque, and, henri, laurens, the, tour, s, main, attraction, was, guernica, from, january, to, april, 1938, the, tour, visited, oslo, copenhagen, stockholm, and, g, teborg, starting, in, late, september, guernica, was, exhibited, in, london, s, whitechapel, art, gallery, this, stop, was, organized, by, sir, roland, penrose, with,

france, italy, and, germany, it, then, travelled, to, leeds, liverpool, and, in, early, 1939, manchester, there, manchester, foodship, for, spain, a, group, of, artists, and, activists, engaged, in, sending, aid, to, the, people, of, spain, exhibited, the, painting, in, the, he, nunn, co, ford, automobile, showroom, for, two, weeks, guernica, then, returned, briefly, to, france, after, francisco, franco, s, victory, in, spain, guernica, was, sent, to, the, united, states, to, raise, funds, and, support, for, spanish, refugees, it, was, first, shown, at, the, valentine, gallery, in, new, york, city, in, may, 1939, the, san, francisco, museum, of, art, later, renamed, the, san, francisco, museum, of, modern, art, gave, the, work, its, first, museum, appearance, in, the, united, states, from, 27, august, to, 19, september, 1939, new, york, s, museum, of, modern, art, moma, then, mounted, an, exhibition, from, 15, november, until, 7, january, 1940, entitled, picasso, 40, years, of, his,

studies, at, picasso, s, request, the, safekeeping, of, guernica, was, then, entrusted, to, the, museum, of, modern, art, and, it, was, his, expressed, desire, that, the, painting, should, not, be, delivered, to, spain, until, liberty, and, democracy, had, been, established, in, the, country, between, 1939, and, 1952, guernica, traveled, extensively, in, the, united, states, between, 1941, and,

then, in, numerous, other, major, european, cities, before, returning, to, moma, for, a, retrospective, celebrating, picasso, s, 75th, birthday, it, then, went, to, chicago, and, philadelphia, by, this, time, concern, for, the, state, of, the, painting, resulted, in, a, decision, to, keep, it, in, one, place, a, room, on, moma, s, third, floor, where, it, was, accompanied, by, several, of, picasso, s, preliminary, studies, and, some, of, dora, maar, s, photographs, of, the, work, in, progress, the, studies, and, photos, were, often, loaned, for, other, exhibitions, but, until, 1981, guernica, itself, remained, at, moma, during, the, vietnam, war, the, room, containing, the, painting, became, the, site, of, occasional, anti, war, vigils, these, were, usually, peaceful, and, uneventful, but, on, 28, february, 1974, tony, shafrazi, ostensibly, protesting, second, lieutenant, william, calley, s, petition, for, habeas, corpus, following, his, indictment, and, sentencing,
