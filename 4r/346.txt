plucked, the, tuba, uk, tj, u, b, us, t, u, b, is, the, largest, and, lowest, pitched, musical, instrument, in, the, brass, family, as, with, all, brass, instruments, the, sound, is, produced, by, lip, vibration, a, buzz, into, a, mouthpiece, it, first, appeared, in, the, mid, 19th, century, making, it, one, of, the, newer, instruments, in, the, modern, orchestra, and, concert, band, and, largely, replaced, the, ophicleide, tuba, is, latin, for, trumpet, a, person, who, plays, the, tuba, is, called, a, tubaist, a, tubist, or, simply, a, tuba, player, in, a, british, brass, band, or, military, band, they, are, known, as, bass, players, prussian, patent, no, 19, was, granted, to, wilhelm, friedrich, wieprecht, and, johann, gottfried, moritz, on, 12, september, 1835, for, a, bass, tuba, in, f1, the, original, wieprecht, and, moritz, instrument, used, five, valves, of, the, berlinerpumpen, type, that, was, the, forerunner, of, the, modern, piston, valve, the, first, tenor, tuba, was, invented, in, 1838, by, moritz, s, son, carl, wilhelm, moritz, the, addition, of, valves, made, it, possible, to, play, low, in, the, harmonic, series, of, the, instrument, and, still, have, a, complete, selection, of, notes, prior, to, the, invention, of, valves, brass, instruments, were, limited, to, notes, in, the, harmonic, series, and, were, thus, generally, played, very, high, with, respect, to, their, fundamental, pitch, harmonics, starting, three, octaves, above, the, fundamental, pitch, are, about, a, whole, step, apart, making, a, useful, variety, of, notes, possible, the, ophicleide, used, a, bowl, shaped, brass, instrument, mouthpiece, but, had, keys, and, tone, holes, similar, to, those, of, a, modern, saxophone, another, forerunner, to, the, tuba, the, serpent, was, a, bass, instrument, shaped, in, a, wavy, form, to, make, the, tone, holes, accessible, to, the, player, tone, holes, change, the, pitch, by, providing, an, intentional, leak, in, the, bugle, of, the, instrument, but, this, system, has, a, pronounced, effect, on, the, timbre, by, using, valves, instead, the, tuba, could, produce, a, smoother, tone, which, led, to, its, popularity, tubas, were, mostly, used, by, french, composers, especially, hector, berlioz, who, famously, used, the, ophicleide, in, his, compositions, symphonie, fantastique, and, benvenuto, cellini, these, pieces, are, now, normally, performed, on, f, or, cc, tuba, adolphe, sax, like, wieprecht, was, interested, in, marketing, families, of, instruments, ranging, from, soprano, to, bass, and, developed, a, series, of, brass, instruments, known, as, saxhorns, the, instruments, developed, by, sax, were, generally, pitched, in, e, and, b, while, the, wieprecht, basstuba, and, the, subsequent, erven, contrabass, tuba, were, pitched, in, f, and, c, see, below, on, pitch, systems, sax, s, instruments, gained, dominance, in, france, and, later, in, britain, and, america, as, a, result, of, the, movements, of, popular, instrument, makers, such, as, gustave, auguste, besson, who, moved, from, france, to, britain, and, henry, distin, who, eventually, found, his, way, to, america, the, cimbasso, is, also, seen, instead, of, a, tuba, in, the, orchestral, repertoire, the, name, is, translated, from, corno, in, basso, in, german, the, original, design, was, inspired, by, the, ophicleide, and, the, bassoon, the, cimbasso, is, rare, today, but, it, is, sometimes, used, in, historically, accurate, performances, an, orchestra, usually, has, a, single, tuba, though, an, additional, tuba, may, be, requested, it, serves, as, the, bass, of, the, orchestral, brass, section, and, it, can, reinforce, the, bass, voices, of, the, strings, and, woodwinds, it, provides, the, bass, of, brass, quintets, and, choirs, though, many, small, brass, ensembles, will, use, the, euphonium, or, bass, trombone, as, the, lowest, voice, it, is, the, principal, bass, instrument, in, concert, bands, brass, bands, and, military, bands, and, those, ensembles, generally, have, two, to, four, tubas, it, is, also, a, solo, instrument, tubas, are, used, in, marching, bands, drum, and, bugle, corps, and, in, many, jazz, bands, see, below, in, british, style, brass, bands, two, e, and, two, b, tubas, are, used, and, are, referred, to, as, basses, well, known, and, influential, parts, for, the, tuba, include, concertos, have, been, written, for, the, tuba, by, many, notable, composers, including, ralph, vaughan, williams, tuba, concerto, edward, gregson, john, williams, alexander, arutiunian, eric, ewazen, james, barnes, joseph, hallman, martin, ellerby, philip, sparke, kalevi, aho, josef, tal, bruce, broughton, tuba, concerto, john, golland, roger, steptoe, david, carlson, jennifer, higdon, tuba, concerto, and, marcus, paus, tuba, mirum, tubas, are, found, in, various, pitches, most, commonly, in, f, e, c, or, b, the, key, of, a, tuba, depends, on, the, fundamental, pitch, of, the, instrument, or, fundamental, note, in, the, series, of, overtones, also, called, partials, available, without, any, valves, being, pressed, tubas, in, different, keys, use, different, lengths, of, tubing, the, main, tube, of, a, b, tuba, is, approximately, 18, feet, 5, 5, m, long, while, that, of, a, c, tuba, is, 16, feet, 4, 9, m, of, an, e, tuba, 13, feet, 4, 0, m, and, of, an, f, tuba, 12, feet, 3, 7, m, the, instrument, has, a, conical, bore, meaning, the, bore, diameter, increases, as, a, function, of, the, tubing, length, from, the, mouthpiece, to, the, bell, the, conical, bore, causes, the, instrument, to, produce, a, preponderance, of, even, order, harmonics, a, tuba, with, its, tubing, wrapped, for, placing, the, instrument, on, the, player, s, lap, is, usually, called, a, concert, tuba, or, simply, a, tuba, tubas, with, the, bell, pointing, forward, pavillon, tournant, instead, of, upward, are, often, called, recording, tubas, because, of, their, popularity, in, the, early, days, of, recorded, music, as, their, sound, could, more, easily, be, directed, at, the, recording, microphone, when, wrapped, to, surround, the, body, for, cavalry, bands, on, horseback, or, marching, it, is, traditionally, known, as, a, helicon, the, modern, sousaphone, named, after, american, bandmaster, john, philip, sousa, resembles, a, helicon, with, the, bell, pointed, up, in, the, original, models, as, the, j, w, pepper, prototype, and, sousa, s, concert, instruments, and, then, curved, to, point, forward, as, developed, by, conn, and, others, some, ancestors, of, the, tuba, such, as, the, military, bombardon, had, unusual, valve, and, bore, arrangements, compared, to, modern, tubas, during, the, american, civil, war, most, brass, bands, used, a, branch, of, the, brass, family, known, as, saxhorns, which, by, today, s, standards, have, a, narrower, bore, taper, than, tuba, the, same, as, true, cornets, and, baritones, but, distinct, from, trumpets, euphoniums, and, others, with, different, tapers, or, no, taper, around, the, start, of, the, civil, war, saxhorns, manufactured, for, military, use, in, the, usa, were, commonly, wrapped, with, the, bell, pointing, backwards, over, the, player, s, shoulder, and, these, were, known, as, over, the, shoulder, saxhorns, and, came, in, sizes, from, cornets, down, to, e, basses, however, the, e, bass, even, though, it, shared, the, same, tube, length, as, a, modern, e, tuba, has, a, narrower, bore, and, as, such, cannot, be, called, by, the, name, tuba, except, as, a, convenience, when, comparing, it, to, other, sizes, of, the, saxhorn, most, music, for, the, tuba, is, written, in, bass, clef, in, concert, pitch, so, tuba, players, must, know, the, correct, fingerings, for, their, specific, instruments, traditional, british, style, brass, band, parts, for, the, tuba, are, usually, written, in, treble, clef, with, the, b, tuba, sounding, two, octaves, and, one, step, below, and, the, e, tuba, sounding, one, octave, and, a, major, sixth, below, the, written, pitch, this, allows, musicians, to, change, instruments, without, learning, new, fingerings, for, the, same, written, music, consequently, when, its, music, is, written, in, treble, clef, the, tuba, is, a, transposing, instrument, but, not, when, the, music, is, in, bass, clef, the, lowest, pitched, tubas, are, the, contrabass, tubas, pitched, in, c, or, b, referred, to, as, cc, and, bb, tubas, respectively, based, on, a, traditional, distortion, of, a, now, obsolete, octave, naming, convention, the, fundamental, pitch, of, a, cc, tuba, is, 32, hz, and, for, a, bb, tuba, 29, hz, the, cc, tuba, is, used, as, an, orchestral, and, concert, band, instrument, in, the, u, s, but, bb, tubas, are, the, contrabass, tuba, of, choice, in, german, austrian, and, russian, orchestras, in, the, united, states, the, bb, tuba, is, the, most, common, in, schools, largely, due, to, the, use, of, bb, sousaphones, in, high, school, marching, bands, and, for, adult, amateurs, many, professionals, in, the, u, s, play, cc, tubas, with, bb, also, common, and, many, train, in, the, use, of, all, four, pitches, of, tubas, the, next, smaller, tubas, are, the, bass, tubas, pitched, in, f, or, e, a, fourth, above, the, contrabass, tubas, the, e, tuba, often, plays, an, octave, above, the, contrabass, tubas, in, brass, bands, and, the, f, tuba, is, commonly, used, by, professional, players, as, a, solo, instrument, and, in, america, to, play, higher, parts, in, the, classical, repertoire, or, parts, that, were, originally, written, for, the, f, tuba, as, is, the, case, with, berlioz, in, most, of, europe, the, f, tuba, is, the, standard, orchestral, instrument, supplemented, by, the, cc, or, bb, only, when, the, extra, weight, is, desired, wagner, for, example, specifically, notates, the, low, tuba, parts, for, kontrabasstuba, which, are, played, on, cc, or, bb, tubas, in, most, regions, in, the, united, kingdom, the, e, is, the, standard, orchestral, tuba, the, euphonium, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, a, tenor, tuba, and, is, pitched, in, b, one, octave, higher, than, the, bb, contrabass, tuba, the, term, tenor, tuba, is, often, used, more, specifically, to, refer, to, b, rotary, valved, tubas, pitched, in, the, same, octave, as, euphoniums, the, small, swiss, tuba, in, c, is, a, tenor, tuba, pitched, in, c, and, provided, with, 6, valves, to, make, the, lower, notes, in, the, orchestral, repertoire, possible, the, french, c, tuba, was, the, standard, instrument, in, french, orchestras, until, overtaken, by, f, and, c, tubas, since, the, second, world, war, one, popular, example, of, the, use, of, the, french, c, tuba, is, the, byd, o, movement, in, ravel, s, orchestration, of, mussorgsky, s, pictures, at, an, exhibition, though, the, rest, of, the, work, is, scored, for, this, instrument, as, well, larger, bbb, subcontrabass, tubas, exist, but, are, extremely, rare, there, are, at, least, four, known, examples, the, first, two, were, built, by, gustave, besson, in, bbb, one, octave, below, the, bb, contrabass, tuba, on, the, suggestion, of, john, philip, sousa, the, monster, instruments, were, not, completed, until, just, after, sousa, s, death, later, in, the, 1950s, british, musician, gerard, hoffnung, commissioned, the, london, firm, of, paxman, to, create, a, subcontrabass, tuba, in, eee, for, use, in, his, comedic, music, festivals, also, a, tuba, pitched, in, fff, was, made, in, kraslice, by, bohland, fuchs, probably, during, 1910, or, 1911, and, was, destined, for, the, world, exhibition, in, new, york, in, 1913, two, players, are, needed, one, to, operate, the, valves, and, one, to, blow, into, the, mouthpiece, in, addition, to, the, length, of, the, instrument, which, dictates, the, fundamental, pitch, tubas, also, vary, in, overall, width, of, the, tubing, sections, tuba, sizes, are, usually, denoted, by, a, quarter, system, with, 4, 4, designating, a, normal, full, size, tuba, larger, rotary, instruments, are, known, as, kaisertubas, and, are, often, denoted, 5, 4, larger, piston, tubas, particularly, those, with, front, action, are, sometimes, known, as, grand, orchestral, tubas, examples, the, conn, 36j, orchestra, grand, bass, from, the, 1930s, and, the, current, model, hirsbrunner, hb, 50, grand, orchestral, which, is, a, replica, of, the, large, york, tubas, owned, by, the, chicago, symphony, orchestra, grand, orchestral, tubas, are, generally, described, as, 6, 4, tubas, smaller, instruments, may, be, described, as, 3, 4, instruments, no, standards, exist, for, these, designations, and, their, use, is, up, to, manufacturers, who, usually, use, them, to, distinguish, among, the, instruments, in, their, own, product, line, the, size, designation, is, related, to, the, larger, outer, branches, and, not, to, the, bore, of, the, tubing, at, the, valves, though, the, bore, is, usually, reported, in, instrument, specifications, the, quarter, system, is, also, not, directly, related, to, bell, size, though, there, is, typically, a, correlation, 3, 4, tubas, are, common, in, american, grade, schools, for, use, by, young, tuba, players, for, whom, a, full, size, instrument, might, be, too, cumbersome, though, smaller, and, lighter, they, are, tuned, and, keyed, identically, to, full, size, tubas, of, the, same, pitch, although, they, usually, have, 3, rather, than, 4, or, 5, valves, tubas, are, made, with, either, piston, or, rotary, valves, rotary, valves, invented, by, joseph, riedl, are, based, on, a, design, included, in, the, original, valve, patents, by, friedrich, bl, hmel, and, heinrich, st, lzel, in, 1818, erven, of, graslitz, was, the, first, to, use, true, rotary, valves, starting, in, the, 1840s, or, 1850s, modern, piston, valves, were, developed, by, fran, ois, p, rinet, for, the, saxhorn, family, of, instruments, promoted, by, adolphe, sax, around, the, same, time, pistons, may, either, be, oriented, to, point, to, the, top, of, the, instrument, top, action, or, out, the, front, of, the, instrument, front, action, or, side, action, piston, valves, require, more, maintenance, than, rotary, valves, they, require, regular, oiling, to, keep, them, freely, operating, while, rotary, valves, are, sealed, and, seldom, require, oiling, piston, valves, are, easy, to, disassemble, and, re, assemble, while, rotary, valve, disassembly, and, re, assembly, is, much, more, difficult, and, is, generally, left, to, qualified, instrument, repair, persons, tubas, generally, have, from, three, to, six, valves, though, some, rare, exceptions, exist, three, valve, tubas, are, generally, the, least, expensive, and, are, almost, exclusively, used, by, amateurs, and, the, sousaphone, a, marching, version, of, a, bb, tuba, usually, has, three, valves, among, advanced, players, four, and, five, valve, tubas, are, by, far, the, most, common, choices, with, six, valve, tubas, being, relatively, rare, except, among, f, tubas, which, mostly, have, five, or, six, valves, the, valves, add, tubing, to, the, main, tube, of, the, instrument, thus, lowering, its, fundamental, pitch, the, first, valve, lowers, the, pitch, by, a, whole, step, two, semitones, the, second, valve, by, a, semitone, and, the, third, valve, by, three, semitones, used, in, combination, the, valve, tubing, is, too, short, and, the, resulting, pitch, tends, to, be, sharp, for, example, a, bb, tuba, becomes, in, effect, an, a, tuba, when, the, first, valve, is, depressed, the, third, valve, is, long, enough, to, lower, the, pitch, of, a, bb, tuba, by, three, semitones, but, it, is, not, long, enough, to, lower, the, pitch, of, an, a, tuba, by, three, semitones, thus, the, first, and, third, valves, used, in, combination, lower, the, pitch, by, something, just, short, of, five, semitones, and, the, first, three, valves, used, in, combination, are, nearly, a, quarter, tone, sharp, the, fourth, valve, is, used, in, place, of, combinations, of, the, first, and, third, valves, and, the, second, and, fourth, used, in, combination, are, used, in, place, of, the, first, three, valves, in, combination, the, fourth, valve, can, be, tuned, to, lower, the, pitch, of, the, main, tube, accurately, by, five, semitones, and, thus, its, use, corrects, the, main, problem, of, combinations, being, too, sharp, by, using, the, fourth, valve, by, itself, to, replace, the, first, and, third, combination, or, the, fourth, and, second, valves, in, place, of, the, first, second, and, third, valve, combinations, the, notes, requiring, these, fingerings, are, more, in, tune, the, fourth, valve, used, in, combination, with, rather, than, instead, of, the, first, three, valves, fills, in, the, missing, notes, in, the, bottom, octave, allowing, the, player, to, play, chromatically, down, to, the, fundamental, pitch, of, the, instrument, for, the, reason, given, in, the, preceding, paragraph, some, of, these, notes, will, tend, to, be, sharp, and, must, by, lipped, into, tune, by, the, player, a, fifth, and, sixth, valve, if, fitted, are, used, to, provide, alternative, fingering, possibilities, to, improve, intonation, and, are, also, used, to, reach, into, the, low, register, of, the, instrument, where, all, the, valves, will, be, used, in, combination, to, fill, the, first, octave, between, the, fundamental, pitch, and, the, next, available, note, on, the, open, tube, the, fifth, and, sixth, valves, also, give, the, musician, the, ability, to, trill, more, smoothly, or, to, use, alternative, fingerings, for, ease, of, playing, this, type, of, tuba, is, what, is, most, found, in, orchestras, and, wind, bands, around, the, world, the, bass, tuba, in, f, is, pitched, a, fifth, above, the, bb, tuba, and, a, fourth, above, the, cc, tuba, so, it, needs, additional, tubing, length, beyond, that, provided, by, four, valves, to, play, securely, down, to, a, low, f, as, required, in, much, tuba, music, the, fifth, valve, is, commonly, tuned, to, a, flat, whole, step, so, that, when, used, with, the, fourth, valve, it, gives, an, in, tune, low, b, the, sixth, valve, is, commonly, tuned, as, a, flat, half, step, allowing, the, f, tuba, to, play, low, g, as, 1, 4, 5, 6, and, low, g, as, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, in, cc, tubas, with, five, valves, the, fifth, valve, may, be, tuned, as, a, flat, whole, step, or, as, a, minor, third, depending, on, the, instrument, some, tubas, have, a, compensating, system, to, allow, accurate, tuning, when, using, several, valves, in, combination, simplifying, fingering, and, removing, the, need, to, constantly, adjust, slide, positions, the, most, popular, of, the, automatic, compensation, systems, was, invented, by, blaikley, bevan, 1874, and, was, patented, by, boosey, later, boosey, and, hawkes, which, also, later, still, produced, besson, instruments, the, patent, on, the, system, limited, its, application, outside, of, britain, and, to, this, day, tubas, with, compensating, valves, are, primarily, popular, in, the, united, kingdom, and, countries, of, the, former, british, empire, the, blaikley, design, plumbs, the, instrument, so, that, if, the, fourth, valve, is, used, the, air, is, sent, back, through, a, second, set, of, branches, in, the, first, three, valves, to, compensate, for, the, combination, of, valves, this, does, have, the, disadvantage, of, making, the, instrument, significantly, more, stuffy, or, resistant, to, air, flow, when, compared, to, a, non, compensating, tuba, this, is, due, to, the, need, for, the, air, to, flow, through, the, valves, twice, it, also, makes, the, instrument, heavier, but, many, prefer, this, approach, to, having, additional, valves, or, to, the, manipulation, of, tuning, slides, while, playing, to, achieve, improved, intonation, within, an, ensemble, most, modern, professional, grade, euphoniums, also, now, feature, blaikley, style, compensating, valves, some, tubas, have, a, strong, and, useful, resonance, that, is, not, in, the, well, known, harmonic, series, for, example, most, large, b, tubas, have, a, strong, resonance, at, low, e, e, 1, 39, hz, which, is, between, the, fundamental, and, the, second, harmonic, an, octave, higher, than, the, fundamental, these, alternative, resonances, are, often, known, as, false, tones, or, privileged, tones, adding, the, six, semitones, provided, by, the, three, valves, these, alternative, resonances, let, the, instrument, play, chromatically, down, to, the, fundamental, of, the, open, bugle, which, is, a, 29, hz, b, 0, the, addition, of, valves, below, that, note, can, lower, the, instrument, a, further, six, semitones, to, a, 20, hz, e, 0, thus, even, three, valved, instruments, with, good, alternative, resonances, can, produce, very, low, sounds, in, the, hands, of, skilled, players, instruments, with, four, valves, can, play, even, lower, the, lowest, note, in, the, widely, known, repertoire, is, a, 16, hz, double, pedal, c, 0, in, the, william, kraft, piece, encounters, ii, which, is, often, played, using, a, timed, flutter, tongue, rather, than, by, buzzing, the, lips, the, fundamental, of, this, pitch, borders, on, infrasound, and, its, overtones, define, the, pitch, in, the, listener, s, ear, the, tuba, is, generally, constructed, of, brass, which, is, either, unfinished, lacquered, or, electro, plated, with, nickel, gold, or, silver, unfinished, brass, will, eventually, tarnish, and, thus, must, be, periodically, polished, to, maintain, its, appearance, there, are, many, types, of, tubas, that, are, manufactured, in, europe, the, united, states, and, asia, in, europe, the, predominant, models, that, are, professionally, used, are, meinl, weston, germany, and, miraphone, germany, asian, brands, include, the, yamaha, corporation, japan, and, jupiter, instruments, taiwan, holton, instrument, company, and, king, musical, instruments, are, some, of, the, most, well, known, brands, from, the, united, states, some, tubas, are, capable, of, being, converted, into, a, marching, style, known, as, marching, tubas, a, leadpipe, can, be, manually, screwed, on, next, to, the, valves, the, tuba, is, then, usually, rested, on, the, left, shoulder, although, some, tubas, allow, use, of, the, right, shoulder, with, the, bell, facing, directly, in, front, of, the, player, some, marching, tubas, are, made, only, for, marching, and, cannot, be, converted, into, a, concert, model, most, marching, bands, opt, for, the, sousaphone, an, instrument, that, is, easier, to, carry, since, it, was, invented, specifically, for, this, and, almost, always, cheaper, than, a, true, marching, tuba, the, earlier, helicon, is, still, used, by, bands, in, europe, and, other, parts, of, the, world, drum, and, bugle, corps, players, however, generally, use, marching, tubas, or, contrabass, bugles, standard, tubas, can, also, be, played, whilst, standing, and, marching, which, is, the, usual, practice, in, british, brass, bands, and, military, bands, with, the, comfort, of, the, player, in, mind, companies, have, provided, harnesses, that, sometimes, use, a, strap, joined, to, the, tuba, with, two, rings, a, sack, to, hold, the, bottom, of, the, tuba, or, numerous, straps, holding, the, larger, parts, of, tubing, on, the, tuba, the, strap, s, goes, over, the, shoulder, like, a, sash, or, sit, at, the, waist, so, the, musician, can, play, the, instrument, in, the, same, position, as, when, sitting, the, tuba, has, been, used, in, jazz, since, the, genre, s, inception, in, the, earliest, years, bands, often, used, a, tuba, for, outdoor, playing, and, a, double, bass, for, indoor, performances, in, this, context, the, tuba, was, sometimes, called, brass, bass, as, opposed, to, the, double, bass, string, bass, many, musicians, played, both, instruments, this, practice, was, mostly, used, in, the, new, orleans, jazz, scene, the, tuba, was, used, most, frequently, with, the, louis, armstrong, groups, and, prominent, in, the, album, hot, five, in, modern, jazz, it, is, not, unknown, for, their, players, to, take, solos, new, orleans, style, brass, bands, like, the, dirty, dozen, brass, band, and, the, rebirth, brass, band, use, a, sousaphone, as, the, bass, instrument, bill, barber, played, tuba, on, several, miles, davis, albums, including, the, sessions, compiled, as, the, birth, of, the, cool, and, miles, ahead, new, york, city, based, tubist, marcus, rojas, performed, frequently, with, henry, threadgill, starting, in, 1955, stan, kenton, made, his, fifth, trombonist, double, on, tuba, namely, on, ballads, to, make, use, of, the, tuba, s, distinct, warm, enveloping, sound
