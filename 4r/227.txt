of, the, ten, thousand, an, army, of, greek, mercenaries, hired, by, cyrus, the, younger, to, help, him, seize, the, throne, of, persia, from, his, brother, artaxerxes, ii, in, 401, bc, the, seven, books, making, up, the, anabasis, were, composed, c, 370, bc, although, as, an, ancient, greek, vocabulary, word, means, embarkation, ascent, or, mounting, up, the, title, anabasis, has, been, rendered, by, some, translators, as, the, march, up, country, or, as, the, march, of, the, ten, thousand, the, story, of, the, army, s, journey, across, asia, minor, and, mesopotamia, is, xenophon, s, best, known, work, and, one, of, the, great, adventures, in, human, history, xenophon, in, his, hellenica, did, not, cover, the, retreat, of, cyrus, but, instead, referred, the, reader, to, the, anabasis, by, themistogenes, of, syracuse, the, tenth, century, suda, also, describes, anabasis, as, being, the, work, of, themistogenes, preserved, among, the, works, of, xenophon, in, the, entry, j, s, watson, in, his, remarks, on, the, authorship, of, anabasis, refers, to, the, various, interpretations, of, the, word, which, give, rise, to, different, interpretations, and, different, problems, aside, from, these, two, references, there, is, no, authority, for, there, being, a, contemporary, anabasis, written, by, themistogenes, of, syracuse, and, no, mention, of, such, a, person, in, any, other, context, by, the, end, of, the, 1st, century, plutarch, had, said, in, his, glory, of, the, athenians, that, xenophon, had, attributed, anabasis, to, a, third, party, to, distance, himself, as, a, subject, from, himself, as, a, writer, while, the, attribution, to, themistogenes, has, been, raised, many, times, the, view, of, most, scholars, aligns, substantially, with, that, of, plutarch, and, certainly, that, all, the, volumes, were, written, by, xenophon, himself, xenophon, accompanied, the, ten, thousand, words, that, xenophon, does, not, use, a, large, army, of, greek, mercenaries, hired, by, cyrus, the, younger, who, intended, to, seize, the, throne, of, persia, from, his, brother, artaxerxes, ii, although, cyrus, mixed, army, fought, to, a, tactical, victory, at, cunaxa, in,

account, of, the, exploit, resounded, through, greece, where, two, generations, later, some, surmise, it, may, have, inspired, philip, of, macedon, to, believe, that, a, lean, and, disciplined,
