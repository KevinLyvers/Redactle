the, brandenburg, concertos, bwv, 1046, 1051, by, johann, sebastian, bach, are, a, collection, of, six, instrumental, works, presented, by, bach, to, christian, ludwig, margrave, of, brandenburg, schwedt, in, 1721, though, probably, composed, earlier, the, original, french, title, is, six, concerts, avec, plusieurs, instruments, meaning, six, concertos, for, several, instruments, some, of, the, pieces, feature, several, solo, instruments, in, combination, they, are, widely, regarded, as, some, of, the, greatest, orchestral, compositions, of, the, baroque, era, it, is, uncertain, when, most, of, the, material, for, the, brandenburg, concertos, was, written, it, is, clear, that, the, first, movement, of, concerto, no, 1, bwv, 1046, was, based, on, an, introduction, to, bach, s, 1713, cantata, was, mir, behagt, and, the, second, and, last, may, have, been, as, well, it, also, seems, likely, that, concerto, no, 5, was, the, last, to, be, written, it, features, a, prominent, harpsichord, part, which, is, presumed, to, be, for, a, new, instrument, ordered, for, prince, leopold, from, the, instrument, maker, michael, mietke, and, paid, for, by, bach, in, berlin, in, 1719, speculation, regarding, the, composition, dates, of, the, other, concertos, varies, taking, into, account, the, styles, of, the, pieces, as, well, as, the, instrumentation, bach, would, have, had, available, during, his, years, prior, to, the, date, of, the, compiled, manuscript, in, 1721, bach, compiled, the, six, concertos, writing, them, almost, entirely, in, his, own, hand, instead, of, leaving, the, work, to, a, copyist, he, presented, the, collection, to, christian, ludwig, margrave, of, brandenburg, schwedt, under, the, title, six, concerts, avec, plusieurs, instruments, six, concertos, for, several, instruments, with, a, dedication, dated, 24, march, translated, from, the, original, french, the, first, sentence, of, bach, s, dedication, reads, as, i, had, the, good, fortune, a, few, years, ago, to, be, heard, by, your, royal, highness, at, your, highness, s, commands, and, as, i, noticed, then, that, your, highness, took, some, pleasure, in, the, little, talents, which, heaven, has, given, me, for, music, and, as, in, taking, leave, of, your, royal, highness, your, highness, deigned, to, honour, me, with, the, command, to, send, your, highness, some, pieces, of, my, composition, i, have, in, accordance, with, your, highness, s, most, gracious, orders, taken, the, liberty, of, rendering, my, most, humble, duty, to, your, royal, highness, with, the, present, concertos, which, i, have, adapted, to, several, instruments, begging, your, highness, most, humbly, not, to, judge, their, imperfection, with, the, rigour, of, that, discriminating, and, sensitive, taste, which, everyone, knows, him, to, have, for, musical, works, but, rather, to, take, into, benign, consideration, the, profound, respect, and, the, most, humble, obedience, which, i, thus, attempt, to, show, him, it, is, likely, that, the, performance, this, excerpt, mentions, happened, during, the, trip, bach, took, to, berlin, in, 1719, to, pay, for, the, new, mietke, harpsichord, bach, s, titular, reference, to, scoring, the, concertos, for, several, instruments, has, drawn, commentary, christoph, wolff, treats, it, as, an, understatement, observing, that, bach, used, the, widest, imaginable, spectrum, of, orchestral, instruments, the, modest, title, does, not, begin, to, suggest, the, degree, of, innovation, exhibited, in, the, daring, combinations, every, one, of, the, six, concertos, set, a, precedent, in, its, scoring, and, every, one, was, to, remain, without, parallel, boyd, 1993, interprets, it, as, an, indication, that, the, concertos, are, written, in, a, venetian, style, with, its, greater, opportunities, for, soloistic, display, concerti, a, quattro, concerti, a, cinque, etc, and, also, perhaps, that, bach, was, indicating, the, number, of, different, instruments, or, that, the, sound, was, intended, to, evoke, a, larger, orchestra, even, with, only, one, player, to, a, part, heinrich, besseler, has, noted, that, the, overall, forces, required, leaving, aside, the, first, concerto, which, was, rewritten, for, a, special, occasion, tallies, exactly, with, the, 17, players, bach, had, at, his, disposal, in, k, then, although, wolff, contradicts, this, contrary, to, conventional, wisdom, the, collection, does, not, reflect, specific, structure, of, ensembles, available, either, to, the, margrave, of, brandenburg, or, to, the, prince, of, anhalt, c, then, it, is, often, asserted, that, christian, ludwig, lacked, the, musicians, in, his, berlin, ensemble, to, perform, the, concertos, and, that, the, score, was, left, unused, in, the, margrave, s, library, until, his, death, in, 1734, but, boyd, argues, that, the, evidence, does, not, necessarily, support, these, assertions, and, that, it, seems, unlikely, that, bach, would, have, sent, him, six, concertos, totally, unsuitable, for, his, musicians, to, play, nevertheless, the, concertos, were, not, included, by, name, in, the, library, inventory, after, christian, ludwig, s, death, and, it, is, uncertain, who, they, went, to, the, next, owner, we, have, a, record, of, was, bach, s, own, pupil, johann, kirnberger, who, left, the, collection, to, princess, anna, amalia, on, his, death, who, subsequently, bequeathed, it, to, the, joachimsthal, gymnasium, from, which, it, was, transferred, to, the, royal, library, of, berlin, now, the, berlin, state, library, in, 1914, the, manuscript, was, nearly, lost, during, world, war, ii, while, being, transported, for, safekeeping, to, prussia, by, train, in, the, care, of, a, librarian, the, train, came, under, aerial, bombardment, and, the, librarian, escaped, from, the, train, to, a, nearby, forest, with, the, scores, hidden, under, his, coat, as, of, 2023, the, manuscript, remains, in, the, berlin, state, library, after, bach, s, death, only, the, fifth, concerto, received, any, widespread, attention, probably, due, to, the, fashion, for, keyboard, concertos, the, rest, seem, to, have, been, forgotten, the, pieces, were, rediscovered, by, siegfried, dehn, who, found, them, in, princess, amalia, s, library, in, 1849, and, had, them, published, for, the, first, time, the, following, year, the, centenary, of, bach, s, death, however, this, publication, appears, not, to, have, spurred, large, numbers, of, performances, and, those, that, did, occur, tended, to, adapt, the, instrumentation, to, the, forces, available, to, modern, orchestras, the, concertos, current, place, in, the, canon, is, instead, owed, to, the, advent, of, recording, technology, the, first, recording, of, the, complete, set, was, made, in, 1936, directed, by, adolf, busch, and, the, revival, of, interest, in, historically, informed, performance, made, the, pieces, popular, for, further, recordings, on, period, instruments, they, have, also, been, performed, as, chamber, music, with, one, instrument, per, part, especially, by, groups, using, baroque, instruments, and, historically, informed, techniques, and, practice, there, is, also, an, arrangement, for, four, hand, piano, duet, by, composer, max, reger, a, karl, richter, recording, of, concerto, no, 2, was, sent, into, space, in, 1977, on, the, voyager, golden, record, in, 2001, the, piece, came, in, at, number, 22, in, the, classic, 100, original, abc, listing, in, 2007, all, six, of, the, concertos, appeared, on, the, classic, 100, concerto, abc, listing, in, the, overview, table, the, first, column, shows, the, title, the, second, the, key, the, third, the, number, in, the, bach, werke, verzeichnis, bwv, the,

continuo, instrumentation, two, corni, da, caccia, natural, horns, three, oboes, bassoon, violino, piccolo, two, violins, viola, and, basso, continuo, harpsichord, cello, viola, da, gamba, and, or, violone, duration, about, 22, minutes, the, brandenburg, concerto, no, 1, bwv, 1046, 2, bwv, 1046, is, the, only, one, in, the, collection, with, four, movements, the, concerto, also, exists, in, an, alternative, version, sinfonia, bwv, 1046, 1, formerly, bwv, 1046a, which, appears, to, have, been, composed, during, bach, s, years, at, weimar, the, sinfonia, which, lacks, the, third, movement, entirely, and, the, polacca, or, poloinesse, polonaise, from, the, final, movement, appears, to, have, been, intended, as, the, opening, of, the, cantata, was, mir, behagt, ist, nur, die, muntre, jagd, bwv, 208, this, implies, a, date, of, composition, possibly, as, early, as, the, 1713, premiere, of, the, cantata, although, it, could, have, been, used, for, a, subsequent, revival, the, first, movement, can, also, be, found, as, the, sinfonia, of, a, later, cantata, falsche, welt, dir, trau, ich, nicht, bwv, 52, but, in, a, version, without, the, piccolo, violin, that, is, closer, to, sinfonia, bwv, 1046a, the, third, movement, was, used, as, the, opening, chorus, of, the, cantata, vereinigte, zwietracht, der, wechselnden, saiten, bwv, 207, where, the, horns, are, replaced, by, trumpets, title, on, autograph, score, concerto, 2, do, 1, tromba, 1, flauto, 1, hautbois, 1, violino, concertati, 2, violini, 1, viola, violone, in, ripieno, col, violoncello, basso, per, il, cembalo, concertino, natural, trumpet, in, f, recorder, oboe, violin, ripieno, two, violins, viola, violone, cello, and, harpsichord, as, basso, continuo, duration, about, 13, minutes, the, trumpet, part, is, still, considered, one, of, the, most, difficult, in, the, entire, repertoire, and, was, originally, written, for, a, clarino, specialist, almost, certainly, the, court, trumpeter, in, k, then, johann, ludwig, schreiber, after, clarino, skills, were, lost, in, the, eighteenth, century, and, before, the, rise, of, the, historically, informed, performance, movement, of, the, late, twentieth, century, the, part, was, often, played, on, the, piccolo, trumpet, in, b, and, occasionally, on, a, french, horn, the, clarino, does, not, play, in, the, second, movement, as, is, common, practice, in, baroque, era, concerti, this, is, due, to, its, construction, which, allows, it, to, play, only, in, major, keys, because, concerti, often, move, to, a, minor, key, in, the, second, movement, concerti, that, include, the, instrument, in, their, first, movement, and, are, from, the, period, before, the, valved, trumpet, was, commonly, used, usually, exclude, the, trumpet, from, the, second, movement, the, first, movement, of, this, concerto, was, chosen, as, the, first, musical, piece, to, be, played, on, the, voyager, golden, record, a, phonograph, record, containing, a, broad, sample, of, earth, s, common, sounds, languages, and, music, sent, into, outer, space, with, the, two, voyager, probes, the, first, movement, served, as, a, theme, for, great, performances, in, the, early, to, mid, 1980s, while, the, third, movement, served, as, the, theme, for, william, f, buckley, jr, s, firing, line, a, revival, featuring, margaret, hoover, also, used, the, first, movement, recent, research, has, revealed, that, this, concerto, is, based, on, a, lost, chamber, music, version, for, quintet, called, concerto, da, camera, in, fa, maggiore, chamber, concerto, in, f, major, whose, catalogue, number, is, bwv, 1047r, it, is, similar, to, the, orchestral, version, in, that, the, trumpet, flute, oboe, and, solo, violin, parts, are, the, same, but, the, orchestra, part, has, been, arranged, for, basso, continuo, or, piano, by, klaus, hofmann, this, reconstructed, quintet, arrangement, is, also, the, very, first, piano, reduction, of, the, 2nd, brandenburg, concerto, ever, published, by, b, renreiter, verlag, product, number, ba, 5196, title, on, autograph, score, concerto, 3, zo, tre, violini, tre, viole, tre, violoncelli, col, basso, per, il, cembalo, instrumentation, three, violins, three, violas, three, cellos, and, harpsichord, as, basso, continuo, duration, about, 10, minutes, the, second, movement, consists, of, a, single, measure, with, the, two, chords, that, make, up, a, phrygian, half, cadence, and, although, there, is, no, direct, evidence, to, support, it, it, is, likely, that, these, chords, were, meant, to, surround, or, follow, a, cadenza, improvised, by, the, harpsichord, or, a, solo, violin, player, modern, performance, approaches, range, from, simply, playing, the, cadence, with, minimal, ornamentation, treating, it, as, a, sort, of, musical, semicolon, to, cadenzas, varying, in, length, from, under, a, minute, to, over, two, minutes, occasionally, other, slow, movements, from, bach, pieces, such, as, the, largo, from, the, sonata, for, violin, and, continuo, in, g, bwv, 1021, and, the, largo, from, the, sonata, for, violin, and, obbligato, harpsichord, in, g, major, bwv, 1019, are, substituted, for, the, second, movement, as, they, contain, an, identical, phrygian, cadence, as, the, closing, chords, the, outer, movements, use, the, ritornello, form, found, in, many, instrumental, and, vocal, works, of, the, time, the, first, movement, can, also, be, found, in, reworked, form, as, the, sinfonia, of, the, cantata, ich, liebe, den, h, chsten, von, ganzem, gem, te, bwv, 174, with, the, addition, of, three, oboes, and, two, horns, this, concerto, is, the, shortest, of, the, six, title, on, autograph, score, concerto, 4, to, violino, principale, due, fiauti, d, echo, due, violini, una, viola, violone, in, ripieno, violoncello, continuo, concertino, violin, and, two, recorders, described, in, the, original, score, as, flauti, d, echo, ripieno, two, violins, violas, violone, cellos, and, basso, continuo, harpsichord, and, or, viola, da, gamba, duration, about, 15, minutes, and, 20, seconds, the, violin, part, in, this, concerto, is, extremely, virtuosic, in, the, first, and, third, movements, in, the, second, movement, the, violin, provides, a, bass, when, the, concertino, group, plays, unaccompanied, it, has, been, debated, what, instrument, bach, had, in, mind, for, the, fiauti, d, echo, parts, nowadays, these, are, usually, played, on, alto, recorders, although, transverse, flutes, are, sometimes, used, instead, it, is, also, theorised, bach, s, original, intent, may, have, been, the, flageolet, in, some, performances, such, as, those, conducted, by, nikolaus, harnoncourt, the, two, recorders, are, positioned, offstage, thus, giving, an, echo, effect, bach, adapted, the, 4th, brandenburg, concerto, as, a, harpsichord, concerto, bwv, 1057, title, on, autograph, score, concerto, 5, to, une, traversiere, une, violino, principale, une, violino, una, viola, in, ripieno, violoncello, violone, cembalo, concertato, concertino, harpsichord, violin, flute, ripieno, violin, viola, cello, and, violone, duration, about, 23, minutes, the, harpsichord, is, both, a, concertino, and, a, ripieno, instrument, in, the, concertino, passages, the, part, is, obbligato, in, the, ripieno, passages, it, has, a, figured, bass, part, and, plays, continuo, this, concerto, makes, use, of, a, popular, chamber, music, ensemble, of, the, time, flute, violin, and, harpsichord, which, bach, used, on, its, own, for, the, middle, movement, it, is, believed, that, it, was, written, in, 1719, to, show, off, a, new, harpsichord, by, michael, mietke, which, bach, had, brought, back, from, berlin, for, the, k, then, court, it, is, also, thought, that, bach, wrote, it, for, a, competition, at, dresden, with, the, french, composer, and, organist, louis, marchand, in, the, central, movement, bach, uses, one, of, marchand, s, themes, marchand, fled, before, the, competition, could, take, place, apparently, scared, off, in, the, face, of, bach, s, great, reputation, for, virtuosity, and, improvisation, the, concerto, is, well, suited, throughout, to, showing, off, the, qualities, of, a, fine, harpsichord, and, the, virtuosity, of, its, player, but, especially, in, the, lengthy, solo, cadenza, to, the, first, movement, it, seems, almost, certain, that, bach, considered, a, great, organ, and, harpsichord, virtuoso, was, the, harpsichord, soloist, at, the, premiere, scholars, have, seen, in, this, work, the, origins, of, the, solo, keyboard, concerto, as, it, is, the, first, example, of, a, concerto, with, a, solo, keyboard, part, an, earlier, version, bwv, 1050a, exists, and, has, many, small, differences, from, its, later, cousin, but, no, major, difference, in, structure, or, instrumentation, it, is, dated, ca, 1720, 21, title, on, autograph, score, concerto, 6, to, a, due, viole, da, braccio, due, viole, da, gamba, violoncello, violone, e, cembalo, instrumentation, two, viole, da, braccio, two, viole, da, gamba, cello, violone, and, harpsichord, duration, about, 16, minutes, the, absence, of, violins, is, unusual, but, it, is, also, found, in, a, cantata, written, at, wiemar, gleichwie, der, regen, und, schnee, vom, himmel, f, llt, bwv, 18, viola, da, braccio, means, the, normal, viola, and, is, used, here, to, distinguish, it, from, the, viola, da, gamba, the, viola, da, gamba, was, already, an, old, fashioned, instrument, when, bach, compiled, the, brandenburg, concertos, in, 1721, one, reason, for, using, it, may, have, been, the, interest, which, his, employer, prince, leopold, had, in, the, instrument, nikolaus, harnoncourt, speculated, that, prince, leopold, wished, to, play, with, his, orchestra, and, that, bach, s, provision, of, such, music, was, somehow, related, to, the, fact, that, he, was, looking, for, jobs, elsewhere, by, upsetting, the, balance, of, the, musical, roles, he, would, be, released, from, his, servitude, as, kapellmeister, the, two, violas, start, the, first, movement, with, a, vigorous, subject, in, close, canon, and, as, the, movement, progresses, the, other, instruments, are, gradually, drawn, into, the, seemingly, uninterrupted, steady, flow, of, melodic, invention, which, shows, the, composer, s, mastery, of, polyphony, the, two, violas, da, gamba, are, silent, in, the, second, movement, leaving, the, texture, of, a, trio, sonata, for, two, violas, and, continuo, although, the, cello, has, a, decorated, version, of, the, continuo, bass, line, in, the, last, movement, the, spirit, of, the, gigue, underlies, everything, as, it, did, in, the, finale, of, the, fifth, concerto, scores, essays, recordings
