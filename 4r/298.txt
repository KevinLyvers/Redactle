common, use, for, mp3, players, cd, players, and, smartphones, the, modern, english, word, music, came, into, use, in, the, 1630s, it, is, derived, from, a, long, line, of, successive, precursors, the, old, english, musike, of, the, mid, 13th, century, the, old, french, musique, of, the, 12th, century, and, the, latin, m, sica, the, latin, word, itself, derives, from, the, ancient, greek, mousik, techn, literally, meaning, art, of, the, muses, the, muses, were, nine, deities, in, ancient, greek, mythology, who, presided, over, the, arts, and, sciences, they, were, included, in, tales, by, the, earliest, western, authors, homer, and, hesiod, and, eventually, came, to, be, associated, with, music, specifically, over, time, polyhymnia, would, reside, over, music, more, prominently, than, the, other, muses, the, latin, word, musica, was, also, the, originator, for, both, the, spanish, m, sica, and, french, musique, via, spelling, and, linguistic, adjustment, though, other, european, terms, were, probably, loanwords, including, the, italian, musica, german, musik, dutch, muziek, norwegian, musikk, polish, muzyka, and, russian, muz, ka, the, modern, western, world, usually, defines, music, as, an, all, encompassing, term, used, to, describe, diverse, genres, styles, and, traditions, this, is, not, the, case, worldwide, and, languages, such, as, modern, indonesian, musik, and, shona, musakazo, have, recently, adopted, words, to, reflect, this, universal, conception, as, they, did, not, have, words, that, fit, exactly, the, western, scope, before, western, contact, in, east, asia, neither, japan, nor, china, had, a, single, word, that, encompasses, music, in, a, broad, sense, but, culturally, they, often, regarded, music, in, such, a, fashion, the, closest, word, to, mean, music, in, chinese, yue, shares, a, character, with, le, meaning, joy, and, originally, referred, to, all, the, arts, before, narrowing, in, meaning, africa, is, too, diverse, to, make, firm, generalizations, but, the, musicologist, j, h, kwabena, nketia, has, emphasized, african, music, s, often, inseparable, connection, to, dance, and, speech, in, general, some, african, cultures, such, as, the, songye, people, of, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, and, the, tiv, people, of, nigeria, have, a, strong, and, broad, conception, of, music, but, no, corresponding, word, in, their, native, languages, other, words, commonly, translated, as, music, often, have, more, specific, meanings, in, their, respective, cultures, the, hindi, word, for, music, sangita, properly, refers, to, art, music, while, the, many, indigenous, languages, of, the, americas, have, words, for, music, that, refer, specifically, to, song, but, describe, instrumental, music, regardless, though, the, arabic, musiqi, can, refer, to, all, music, it, is, usually, used, for, instrumental, and, metric, music, while, khandan, identifies, vocal, and, improvised, music, it, is, often, debated, to, what, extent, the, origins, of, music, will, ever, be, understood, and, there, are, competing, theories, that, aim, to, explain, it, many, scholars, highlight, a, relationship, between, the, origin, of, music, and, the, origin, of, language, and, there, is, disagreement, surrounding, whether, music, developed, before, after, or, simultaneously, with, language, a, similar, source, of, contention, surrounds, whether, music, was, the, intentional, result, of, natural, selection, or, was, a, byproduct, spandrel, of, evolution, the, earliest, influential, theory, was, proposed, by, charles, darwin, in, 1871, who, stated, that, music, arose, as, a, form, of, sexual, selection, perhaps, via, mating, calls, darwin, s, original, perspective, has, been, heavily, criticized, for, its, inconsistencies, with, other, sexual, selection, methods, though, many, scholars, in, the, 21st, century, have, developed, and, promoted, the, theory, other, theories, include, that, music, arose, to, assist, in, organizing, labor, improving, long, distance, communication, benefiting, communication, with, the, divine, assisting, in, community, cohesion, or, as, a, defense, to, scare, off, predators, prehistoric, music, can, only, be, theorized, based, on, findings, from, paleolithic, archaeology, sites, the, disputed, divje, babe, flute, a, perforated, cave, bear,

electronic, drum, machines, such, as, the, tr, 808, and, synth, bass, devices, such, as, the, tb, 303, or, synth, bass, keyboards, in, the, 1990s, an, increasingly, large, range, of, computerized, hardware, musical, devices, and, instruments, and, software, e, g, digital, audio, workstations, were, used, in, the, 2020s, soft, synths, and, computer, music, apps, make, it, possible, for, bedroom, producers, to, create, and, record, types, of, music, such, as, electronic, dance, music, in, their, home, adding, sampled, and, digital, instruments, and, editing, the, recording, digitally, in, the, 1990s, bands, in, genres, such, as, nu, metal, began, including, djs, in, their, bands, djs, create, music, by, manipulating, recorded, music, using, a, dj, mixer, composition, is, the, act, or, practice, of, creating, a, song, an, instrumental, music, piece, a, work, with, both, singing, and, instruments, or, another, type, of, music, in, many, cultures, including, western, classical, music, the, act, of, composing, also, includes, the, creation, of, music, notation, such, as, a, sheet, music, score, which, is, then, performed, by, the, composer, or, by, other, singers, or, musicians, in, popular, music, and, traditional, music, the, act, of, composing, which, is, typically, called, songwriting, may, involve, the, creation, of, a, basic, outline, of, the, song, called, the, lead, sheet, which, sets, out, the, melody, lyrics, and, chord, progression, in, classical, music, the, composer, typically, orchestrates, his, or, her, own, compositions, but, in, musical, theatre, and, in, pop, music, songwriters, may, hire, an, arranger, to, do, the, orchestration, in, some, cases, a, songwriter, may, not, use, notation, at, all, and, instead, compose, the, song, in, her, mind, and, then, play, or, record, it, from, memory, in, jazz, and, popular, music, notable, recordings, by, influential, performers, are, given, the, weight, that, written, scores, play, in, classical, music, even, when, music, is, notated, relatively, precisely, as, in, classical, music, there, are, many, decisions, that, a, performer, has, to, make, because, notation, does, not, specify, all, of, the, elements, of, music, precisely, the, process, of, deciding, how, to, perform, music, that, has, been, previously, composed, and, notated, is, termed, interpretation, different, performers, interpretations, of, the, same, work, of, music, can, vary, widely, in, terms, of, the, tempos, that, are, chosen, and, the, playing, or, singing, style, or, phrasing, of, the, melodies, composers, and, songwriters, who, present, their, own, music, are, interpreting, their, songs, just, as, much, as, those, who, perform, the, music, of, others, the, standard, body, of, choices, and, techniques, present, at, a, given, time, and, a, given, place, is, referred, to, as, performance, practice, whereas, interpretation, is, generally, used, to, mean, the, individual, choices, of, a, performer, although, a, musical, composition, often, uses, musical, notation, and, has, a, single, author, this, is, not, always, the, case, a, work, of, music, can, have, multiple, composers, which, often, occurs, in, popular, music, when, a, band, collaborates, to, write, a, song, or, in, musical, theatre, when, one, person, writes, the, melodies, a, second, person, writes, the, lyrics, and, a, third, person, orchestrates, the, songs, in, some, styles, of, music, such, as, the, blues, a, composer, songwriter, may, create, perform, and, record, new, songs, or, pieces, without, ever, writing, them, down, in, music, notation, a, piece, of, music, can, also, be, composed, with, words, images, or, computer, programs, that, explain, or, notate, how, the, singer, or, musician, should, create, musical, sounds, examples, range, from, avant, garde, music, that, uses, graphic, notation, to, text, compositions, such, as, aus, den, sieben, tagen, to, computer, programs, that, select, sounds, for, musical, pieces, music, that, makes, heavy, use, of, randomness, and, chance, is, called, aleatoric, music, and, is, associated, with, contemporary, composers, active, in, the, 20th, century, such, as, john, cage, morton, feldman, and, witold, lutos, awski, a, commonly, known, example, of, chance, based, music, is, the, sound, of, wind, chimes, jingling, in, a, breeze, the, study, of, composition, has, traditionally, been, dominated, by, examination, of, methods, and, practice, of, western, classical, music, but, the, definition, of, composition, is, broad, enough, to, include, the, creation, of, popular, music, and, traditional, music, songs, and, instrumental, pieces, as, well, as, spontaneously, improvised, works, like, those, of, free, jazz, performers, and, african, percussionists, such, as, ewe, drummers, performance, is, the, physical, expression, of, music, which, occurs, when, a, song, is, sung, or, piano, piece, guitar, melody, symphony, drum, beat, or, other, musical, part, is, played, in, classical, music, a, work, is, written, in, music, notation, by, a, composer, and, then, performed, once, the, composer, is, satisfied, with, its, structure, and, instrumentation, however, as, it, gets, performed, the, interpretation, of, a, song, or, piece, can, evolve, and, change, in, classical, music, instrumental, performers, singers, or, conductors, may, gradually, make, changes, to, the, phrasing, or, tempo, of, a, piece, in, popular, and, traditional, music, the, performers, have, more, freedom, to, make, changes, to, the, form, of, a, song, or, piece, as, such, in, popular, and, traditional, music, styles, even, when, a, band, plays, a, cover, song, they, can, make, changes, such, as, adding, a, guitar, solo, or, inserting, an, introduction, a, performance, can, either, be, planned, out, and, rehearsed, practiced, which, is, the, norm, in, classical, music, jazz, big, bands, and, many, popular, music, styles, or, improvised, over, a, chord, progression, a, sequence, of, chords, which, is, the, norm, in, small, jazz, and, blues, groups, rehearsals, of, orchestras, concert, bands, and, choirs, are, led, by, a, conductor, rock, blues, and, jazz, bands, are, usually, led, by, the, bandleader, a, rehearsal, is, a, structured, repetition, of, a, song, or, piece, by, the, performers, until, it, can, be, sung, or, played, correctly, and, if, it, is, a, song, or, piece, for, more, than, one, musician, until, the, parts, are, together, from, a, rhythmic, and, tuning, perspective, many, cultures, have, strong, traditions, of, solo, performance, in, which, one, singer, or, instrumentalist, performs, such, as, in, indian, classical, music, and, in, the, western, art, music, tradition, other, cultures, such, as, in, bali, include, strong, traditions, of, group, performance, all, cultures, include, a, mixture, of, both, and, performance, may, range, from, improvised, solo, playing, to, highly, planned, and, organized, performances, such, as, the, modern, classical, concert, religious, processions, classical, music, festivals, or, music, competitions, chamber, music, which, is, music, for, a, small, ensemble, with, only, one, or, a, few, of, each, type, of, instrument, is, often, seen, as, more, intimate, than, large, symphonic, works, musical, improvisation, is, the, creation, of, spontaneous, music, often, within, or, based, on, a, pre, existing, harmonic, framework, chord, progression, or, riffs, improvisers, use, the, notes, of, the, chord, various, scales, that, are, associated, with, each, chord, and, chromatic, ornaments, and, passing, tones, which, may, be, neither, chord, tones, nor, from, the, typical, scales, associated, with, a, chord, musical, improvisation, can, be, done, with, or, without, preparation, improvisation, is, a, major, part, of, some, types, of, music, such, as, blues, jazz, and, jazz, fusion, in, which, instrumental, performers, improvise, solos, melody, lines, and, accompaniment, parts, in, the, western, art, music, tradition, improvisation, was, an, important, skill, during, the, baroque, era, and, during, the, classical, era, in, the, baroque, era, performers, improvised, ornaments, and, basso, continuo, keyboard, players, improvised, chord, voicings, based, on, figured, bass, notation, as, well, the, top, soloists, were, expected, to, be, able, to, improvise, pieces, such, as, preludes, in, the, classical, era, solo, performers, and, singers, improvised, virtuoso, cadenzas, during, concerts, however, in, the, 20th, and, early, 21st, century, as, common, practice, western, art, music, performance, became, institutionalized, in, symphony, orchestras, opera, houses, and, ballets, improvisation, has, played, a, smaller, role, as, more, and, more, music, was, notated, in, scores, and, parts, for, musicians, to, play, at, the, same, time, some, 20th, and, 21st, century, art, music, composers, have, increasingly, included, improvisation, in, their, creative, work, in, indian, classical, music, improvisation, is, a, core, component, and, an, essential, criterion, of, performances, music, is, composed, and, performed, for, many, purposes, ranging, from, aesthetic, pleasure, religious, or, ceremonial, purposes, or, as, an, entertainment, product, for, the, marketplace, when, music, was, only, available, through, sheet, music, scores, such, as, during, the, classical, and, romantic, eras, music, lovers, would, buy, the, sheet, music, of, their, favourite, pieces, and, songs, so, that, they, could, perform, them, at, home, on, the, piano, with, the, advent, of, the, phonograph, records, of, popular, songs, rather, than, sheet, music, became, the, dominant, way, that, music, lovers, would, enjoy, their, favourite, songs, with, the, advent, of, home, tape, recorders, in, the, 1980s, and, digital, music, in, the, 1990s, music, lovers, could, make, tapes, or, playlists, of, favourite, songs, and, take, them, with, them, on, a, portable, cassette, player, or, mp3, player, some, music, lovers, create, mix, tapes, of, favourite, songs, which, serve, as, a, self, portrait, a, gesture, of, friendship, prescription, for, an, ideal, party, an, environment, consisting, solely, of, what, is, most, ardently, loved, amateur, musicians, can, compose, or, perform, music, for, their, own, pleasure, and, derive, income, elsewhere, professional, musicians, are, employed, by, institutions, and, organisations, including, armed, forces, in, marching, bands, concert, bands, and, popular, music, groups, religious, institutions, symphony, orchestras, broadcasting, or, film, production, companies, and, music, schools, professional, musicians, sometimes, work, as, freelancers, or, session, musicians, seeking, contracts, and, engagements, in, a, variety, of, settings, there, are, often, many, links, between, amateur, and, professional, musicians, beginning, amateur, musicians, take, lessons, with, professional, musicians, in, community, settings, advanced, amateur, musicians, perform, with, professional, musicians, in, a, variety, of, ensembles, such, as, community, concert, bands, and, community, orchestras, a, distinction, is, often, made, between, music, performed, for, a, live, audience, and, music, that, is, performed, in, a, studio, so, that, it, can, be, recorded, and, distributed, through, the, music, retail, system, or, the, broadcasting, system, however, there, are, also, many, cases, where, a, live, performance, in, front, of, an, audience, is, also, recorded, and, distributed, live, concert, recordings, are, popular, in, both, classical, music, and, in, popular, music, forms, such, as, rock, where, illegally, taped, live, concerts, are, prized, by, music, lovers, in, the, jam, band, scene, live, improvised, jam, sessions, are, preferred, to, studio, recordings, music, notation, typically, means, the, written, expression, of, music, notes, and, rhythms, on, paper, using, symbols, when, music, is, written, down, the, pitches, and, rhythm, of, the, music, such, as, the, notes, of, a, melody, are, notated, music, notation, often, provides, instructions, on, how, to, perform, the, music, for, example, the, sheet, music, for, a, song, may, state, the, song, is, a, slow, blues, or, a, fast, swing, which, indicates, the, tempo, and, the, genre, to, read, notation, a, person, must, have, an, understanding, of, music, theory, harmony, and, the, performance, practice, associated, with, a, particular, song, or, piece, s, genre, written, notation, varies, with, the, style, and, period, of, music, nowadays, notated, music, is, produced, as, sheet, music, or, for, individuals, with, computer, scorewriter, programs, as, an, image, on, a, computer, screen, in, ancient, times, music, notation, was, put, onto, stone, or, clay, tablets, to, perform, music, from, notation, a, singer, or, instrumentalist, requires, an, understanding, of, the, rhythmic, and, pitch, elements, embodied, in, the, symbols, and, the, performance, practice, that, is, associated, with, a, piece, of, music, or, genre, in, genres, requiring, musical, improvisation, the, performer, often, plays, from, music, where, only, the, chord, changes, and, form, of, the, song, are, written, requiring, the, performer, to, have, a, great, understanding, of, the, music, s, structure, harmony, and, the, styles, of, a, particular, genre, e, g, jazz, or, country, music, in, western, art, music, the, most, common, types, of, written, notation, are, scores, which, include, all, the, music, parts, of, an, ensemble, piece, and, parts, which, are, the, music, notation, for, the, individual, performers, or, singers, in, popular, music, jazz, and, blues, the, standard, musical, notation, is, the, lead, sheet, which, notates, the, melody, chords, lyrics, if, it, is, a, vocal, piece, and, structure, of, the, music, fake, books, are, also, used, in, jazz, they, may, consist, of, lead, sheets, or, simply, chord, charts, which, permit, rhythm, section, members, to, improvise, an, accompaniment, part, to, jazz, songs, scores, and, parts, are, also, used, in, popular, music, and, jazz, particularly, in, large, ensembles, such, as, jazz, big, bands, in, popular, music, guitarists, and, electric, bass, players, often, read, music, notated, in, tablature, often, abbreviated, as, tab, which, indicates, the, location, of, the, notes, to, be, played, on, the, instrument, using, a, diagram, of, the, guitar, or, bass, fingerboard, tablature, was, used, in, the, baroque, era, to, notate, music, for, the, lute, a, stringed, fretted, instrument, many, types, of, music, such, as, traditional, blues, and, folk, music, were, not, written, down, in, sheet, music, instead, they, were, originally, preserved, in, the, memory, of, performers, and, the, songs, were, handed, down, orally, from, one, musician, or, singer, to, another, or, aurally, in, which, a, performer, learns, a, song, by, ear, when, the, composer, of, a, song, or, piece, is, no, longer, known, this, music, is, often, classified, as, traditional, or, as, a, folk, song, different, musical, traditions, have, different, attitudes, towards, how, and, where, to, make, changes, to, the, original, source, material, from, quite, strict, to, those, that, demand, improvisation, or, modification, to, the, music, a, culture, s, history, and, stories, may, also, be, passed, on, by, ear, through, song, music, has, many, different, fundamentals, or, elements, depending, on, the, definition, of, element, being, used, these, can, include, pitch, beat, or, pulse, tempo, rhythm, melody, harmony, texture, style, allocation, of, voices, timbre, or, color, dynamics, expression, articulation, form, and, structure, the, elements, of, music, feature, prominently, in, the, music, curriculums, of, australia, the, uk, and, the, us, all, three, curriculums, identify, pitch, dynamics, timbre, and, texture, as, elements, but, the, other, identified, elements, of, music, are, far, from, universally, agreed, upon, below, is, a, list, of, the, three, official, versions, of, the, elements, of, music, in, relation, to, the, uk, curriculum, in, 2013, the, term, appropriate, musical, notations, was, added, to, their, list, of, elements, and, the, title, of, the, list, was, changed, from, the, elements, of, music, to, the, inter, related, dimensions, of, music, the, inter, related, dimensions, of, music, are, listed, as, pitch, duration, dynamics, tempo, timbre, texture, structure, and, appropriate, musical, notations, the, phrase, the, elements, of, music, is, used, in, a, number, of, different, contexts, the, two, most, common, contexts, can, be, differentiated, by, describing, them, as, the, rudimentary, elements, of, music, and, the, perceptual, elements, of, music, pitch, is, an, aspect, of, a, sound, that, we, can, hear, reflecting, whether, one, musical, sound, note, or, tone, is, higher, or, lower, than, another, musical, sound, note, or, tone, we, can, talk, about, the, highness, or, lowness, of, pitch, in, the, more, general, sense, such, as, the, way, a, listener, hears, a, piercingly, high, piccolo, note, or, whistling, tone, as, higher, in, pitch, than, a, deep, thump, of, a, bass, drum, we, also, talk, about, pitch, in, the, precise, sense, associated, with, musical, melodies, basslines, and, chords, precise, pitch, can, only, be, determined, in, sounds, that, have, a, frequency, that, is, clear, and, stable, enough, to, distinguish, from, noise, for, example, it, is, much, easier, for, listeners, to, discern, the, pitch, of, a, single, note, played, on, a, piano, than, to, try, to, discern, the, pitch, of, a, crash, cymbal, that, is, struck, a, melody, also, called, a, tune, is, a, series, of, pitches, notes, sounding, in, succession, one, after, the, other, often, in, a, rising, and, falling, pattern, the, notes, of, a, melody, are, typically, created, using, pitch, systems, such, as, scales, or, modes, melodies, also, often, contain, notes, from, the, chords, used, in, the, song, the, melodies, in, simple, folk, songs, and, traditional, songs, may, use, only, the, notes, of, a, single, scale, the, scale, associated, with, the, tonic, note, or, key, of, a, given, song, for, example, a, folk, song, in, the, key, of, c, also, referred, to, as, c, major, may, have, a, melody, that, uses, only, the, notes, of, the, c, major, scale, the, individual, notes, c, d, e, f, g, a, b, and, c, these, are, the, white, notes, on, a, piano, keyboard, on, the, other, hand, bebop, era, jazz, from, the, 1940s, and, contemporary, music, from, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, may, use, melodies, with, many, chromatic, notes, i, e, notes, in, addition, to, the, notes, of, the, major, scale, on, a, piano, a, chromatic, scale, would, include, all, the, notes, on, the, keyboard, including, the, white, notes, and, black, notes, and, unusual, scales, such, as, the, whole, tone, scale, a, whole, tone, scale, in, the, key, of, c, would, contain, the, notes, c, d, e, f, g, and, a, a, low, musical, line, played, by, bass, instruments, such, as, double, bass, electric, bass, or, tuba, is, called, a, bassline, harmony, refers, to, the, vertical, sounds, of, pitches, in, music, which, means, pitches, that, are, played, or, sung, together, at, the, same, time, to, create, a, chord, usually, this, means, the, notes, are, played, at, the, same, time, although, harmony, may, also, be, implied, by, a, melody, that, outlines, a, harmonic, structure, i, e, by, using, melody, notes, that, are, played, one, after, the, other, outlining, the, notes, of, a, chord, in, music, written, using, the, system, of, major, minor, tonality, keys, which, includes, most, classical, music, written, from, 1600, to, 1900, and, most, western, pop, rock, and, traditional, music, the, key, of, a, piece, determines, the, home, note, or, tonic, to, which, the, piece, generally, resolves, and, the, character, e, g, major, or, minor, of, the, scale, in, use, simple, classical, pieces, and, many, pop, and, traditional, music, songs, are, written, so, that, all, the, music, is, in, a, single, key, more, complex, classical, pop, and, traditional, music, songs, and, pieces, may, have, two, keys, and, in, some, cases, three, or, more, keys, classical, music, from, the, romantic, era, written, from, about, 1820, 1900, often, contains, multiple, keys, as, does, jazz, especially, bebop, jazz, from, the, 1940s, in, which, the, key, or, home, note, of, a, song, may, change, every, four, bars, or, even, every, two, bars, rhythm, is, the, arrangement, of, sounds, and, silences, in, time, meter, animates, time, in, regular, pulse, groupings, called, measures, or, bars, which, in, western, classical, popular, and, traditional, music, often, group, notes, in, sets, of, two, e, g, 2, 4, time, three, e, g, 3, 4, time, also, known, as, waltz, time, or, 3, 8, time, or, four, e, g, 4, 4, time, meters, are, made, easier, to, hear, because, songs, and, pieces, often, but, not, always, place, an, emphasis, on, the, first, beat, of, each, grouping, notable, exceptions, exist, such, as, the, backbeat, used, in, much, western, pop, and, rock, in, which, a, song, that, uses, a, measure, that, consists, of, four, beats, called, 4, 4, time, or, common, time, will, have, accents, on, beats, two, and, four, which, are, typically, performed, by, the, drummer, on, the, snare, drum, a, loud, and, distinctive, sounding, percussion, instrument, in, pop, and, rock, the, rhythm, parts, of, a, song, are, played, by, the, rhythm, section, which, includes, chord, playing, instruments, e, g, electric, guitar, acoustic, guitar, piano, or, other, keyboard, instruments, a, bass, instrument, typically, electric, bass, or, for, some, styles, such, as, jazz, and, bluegrass, double, bass, and, a, drum, kit, player, musical, texture, is, the, overall, sound, of, a, piece, of, music, or, song, the, texture, of, a, piece, or, song, is, determined, by, how, the, melodic, rhythmic, and, harmonic, materials, are, combined, in, a, composition, thus, determining, the, overall, nature, of, the, sound, in, a, piece, texture, is, often, described, in, regard, to, the, density, or, thickness, and, range, or, width, between, lowest, and, highest, pitches, in, relative, terms, as, well, as, more, specifically, distinguished, according, to, the, number, of, voices, or, parts, and, the, relationship, between, these, voices, see, common, types, below, for, example, a, thick, texture, contains, many, layers, of, instruments, one, layer, can, be, a, string, section, or, another, brass, the, thickness, is, affected, by, the, amount, and, the, richness, of, the, instruments, texture, is, commonly, described, according, to, the, number, of, and, relationship, between, parts, or, lines, of, music, music, that, contains, a, large, number, of, independent, parts, e, g, a, double, concerto, accompanied, by, 100, orchestral, instruments, with, many, interweaving, melodic, lines, is, generally, said, to, have, a, thicker, or, denser, texture, than, a, work, with, few, parts, e, g, a, solo, flute, melody, accompanied, by, a, single, cello, timbre, sometimes, called, color, or, tone, color, is, the, quality, or, sound, of, a, voice, or, instrument, timbre, is, what, makes, a, particular, musical, sound, different, from, another, even, when, they, have, the, same, pitch, and, loudness, for, example, a, 440, hz, a, note, sounds, different, when, it, is, played, on, oboe, piano, violin, or, electric, guitar, even, if, different, players, of, the, same, instrument, play, the, same, note, their, notes, might, sound, different, due, to, differences, in, instrumental, technique, e, g, different, embouchures, different, types, of, accessories, e, g, mouthpieces, for, brass, players, reeds, for, oboe, and, bassoon, players, or, strings, made, out, of, different, materials, for, string, players, e, g, gut, strings, versus, steel, strings, even, two, instrumentalists, playing, the, same, note, on, the, same, instrument, one, after, the, other, may, sound, different, due, to, different, ways, of, playing, the, instrument, e, g, two, string, players, might, hold, the, bow, differently, the, physical, characteristics, of, sound, that, determine, the, perception, of, timbre, include, the, spectrum, envelope, and, overtones, of, a, note, or, musical, sound, for, electric, instruments, developed, in, the, 20th, century, such, as, electric, guitar, electric, bass, and, electric, piano, the, performer, can, also, change, the, tone, by, adjusting, equalizer, controls, tone, controls, on, the, instrument, and, by, using, electronic, effects, units, such, as, distortion, pedals, the, tone, of, the, electric, hammond, organ, is, controlled, by, adjusting, drawbars, expressive, qualities, are, those, elements, in, music, that, create, change, in, music, without, changing, the, main, pitches, or, substantially, changing, the, rhythms, of, the, melody, and, its, accompaniment, performers, including, singers, and, instrumentalists, can, add, musical, expression, to, a, song, or, piece, by, adding, phrasing, by, adding, effects, such, as, vibrato, with, voice, and, some, instruments, such, as, guitar, violin, brass, instruments, and, woodwinds, dynamics, the, loudness, or, softness, of, piece, or, a, section, of, it, tempo, fluctuations, e, g, ritardando, or, accelerando, which, are, respectively, slowing, down, and, speeding, up, the, tempo, by, adding, pauses, or, fermatas, on, a, cadence, and, by, changing, the, articulation, of, the, notes, e, g, making, notes, more, pronounced, or, accented, by, making, notes, more, legato, which, means, smoothly, connected, or, by, making, notes, shorter, expression, is, achieved, through, the, manipulation, of, pitch, such, as, inflection, vibrato, slides, etc, volume, dynamics, accent, tremolo, etc, duration, tempo, fluctuations, rhythmic, changes, changing, note, duration, such, as, with, legato, and, staccato, etc, timbre, e, g, changing, vocal, timbre, from, a, light, to, a, resonant, voice, and, sometimes, even, texture, e, g, doubling, the, bass, note, for, a, richer, effect, in, a, piano, piece, expression, therefore, can, be, seen, as, a, manipulation, of, all, elements, to, convey, an, indication, of, mood, spirit, character, etc, and, as, such, cannot, be, included, as, a, unique, perceptual, element, of, music, although, it, can, be, considered, an, important, rudimentary, element, of, music, in, music, form, describes, the, overall, structure, or, plan, of, a, song, or, piece, of, music, and, it, describes, the, layout, of, a, composition, as, divided, into, sections, in, the, early, 20th, century, tin, pan, alley, songs, and, broadway, musical, songs, were, often, in, aaba, thirty, two, bar, form, in, which, the, a, sections, repeated, the, same, eight, bar, melody, with, variation, and, the, b, section, provided, a, contrasting, melody, or, harmony, for, eight, bars, from, the, 1960s, onward, western, pop, and, rock, songs, are, often, in, verse, chorus, form, which, comprises, a, sequence, of, verse, and, chorus, refrain, sections, with, new, lyrics, for, most, verses, and, repeating, lyrics, for, the, choruses, popular, music, often, makes, use, of, strophic, form, sometimes, in, conjunction, with, the, twelve, bar, blues, in, the, tenth, edition, of, the, oxford, companion, to, music, percy, scholes, defines, musical, form, as, a, series, of, strategies, designed, to, find, a, successful, mean, between, the, opposite, extremes, of, unrelieved, repetition, and, unrelieved, alteration, examples, of, common, forms, of, western, music, include, the, fugue, the, invention, sonata, allegro, canon, strophic, theme, and, variations, and, rondo, scholes, states, that, european, classical, music, had, only, six, stand, alone, forms, simple, binary, simple, ternary, compound, binary, rondo, air, with, variations, and, fugue, although, musicologist, alfred, mann, emphasized, that, the, fugue, is, primarily, a, method, of, composition, that, has, sometimes, taken, on, certain, structural, conventions, where, a, piece, cannot, readily, be, broken, into, sectional, units, though, it, might, borrow, some, form, from, a, poem, story, or, programme, it, is, said, to, be, through, composed, such, is, often, the, case, with, a, fantasia, prelude, rhapsody, etude, or, study, symphonic, poem, bagatelle, impromptu, or, similar, composition, professor, charles, keil, classified, forms, and, formal, detail, as, sectional, developmental, or, variational, the, philosophy, of, music, is, the, study, of, fundamental, questions, regarding, music, and, has, connections, with, questions, in, metaphysics, and, aesthetics, questions, include, in, ancient, times, such, as, with, the, ancient, greeks, the, aesthetics, of, music, explored, the, mathematical, and, cosmological, dimensions, of, rhythmic, and, harmonic, organization, in, the, 18th, century, focus, shifted, to, the, experience, of, hearing, music, and, thus, to, questions, about, its, beauty, and, human, enjoyment, plaisir, and, jouissance, of, music, the, origin, of, this, philosophic, shift, is, sometimes, attributed, to, alexander, gottlieb, baumgarten, in, the, 18th, century, followed, by, immanuel, kant, through, their, writing, the, ancient, term, aesthetics, meaning, sensory, perception, received, its, present, day, connotation, in, the, 2000s, philosophers, have, tended, to, emphasize, issues, besides, beauty, and, enjoyment, for, example, music, s, capacity, to, express, emotion, has, been, foregrounded, in, the, 20th, century, important, contributions, were, made, by, peter, kivy, jerrold, levinson, roger, scruton, and, stephen, davies, however, many, musicians, music, critics, and, other, non, philosophers, have, contributed, to, the, aesthetics, of, music, in, the, 19th, century, a, significant, debate, arose, between, eduard, hanslick, a, music, critic, and, musicologist, and, composer, richard, wagner, regarding, whether, music, can, express, meaning, harry, partch, and, some, other, musicologists, such, as, kyle, gann, have, studied, and, tried, to, popularize, microtonal, music, and, the, usage, of, alternate, musical, scales, modern, composers, like, la, monte, young, rhys, chatham, and, glenn, branca, paid, much, attention, to, a, scale, called, just, intonation, it, is, often, thought, that, music, has, the, ability, to, affect, our, emotions, intellect, and, psychology, it, can, assuage, our, loneliness, or, incite, our, passions, the, philosopher, plato, suggests, in, the, republic, that, music, has, a, direct, effect, on, the, soul, therefore, he, proposes, that, in, the, ideal, regime, music, would, be, closely, regulated, by, the, state, book, vii, in, ancient, china, the, philosopher, confucius, believed, that, music, and, rituals, or, rites, are, interconnected, and, harmonious, with, nature, he, stated, that, music, was, the, harmonization, of, heaven, and, earth, while, the, order, was, brought, by, the, rites, order, making, them, extremely, crucial, functions, in, society, modern, music, psychology, aims, to, explain, and, understand, musical, behavior, and, experience, research, in, this, field, and, its, subfields, are, primarily, empirical, their, knowledge, tends, to, advance, on, the, basis, of, interpretations, of, data, collected, by, systematic, observation, of, and, interaction, with, human, participants, in, addition, to, its, focus, on, fundamental, perceptions, and, cognitive, processes, music, psychology, is, a, field, of, research, with, practical, relevance, for, many, areas, including, music, performance, composition, education, criticism, and, therapy, as, well, as, investigations, of, human, aptitude, skill, intelligence, creativity, and, social, behavior, cognitive, neuroscience, of, music, is, the, scientific, study, of, brain, based, mechanisms, involved, in, the, cognitive, processes, underlying, music, these, behaviours, include, music, listening, performing, composing, reading, writing, and, ancillary, activities, it, also, is, increasingly, concerned, with, the, brain, basis, for, musical, aesthetics, and, musical, emotion, the, field, is, distinguished, by, its, reliance, on, direct, observations, of, the, brain, using, such, techniques, as, functional, magnetic, resonance, imaging, fmri, transcranial, magnetic, stimulation, tms, magnetoencephalography, meg, electroencephalography, eeg, and, positron, emission, tomography, pet, cognitive, musicology, is, a, branch, of, cognitive, science, concerned, with, computationally, modeling, musical, knowledge, with, the, goal, of, understanding, both, music, and, cognition, the, use, of, computer, models, provides, an, exacting, interactive, medium, in, which, to, formulate, and, test, theories, and, has, roots, in, artificial, intelligence, and, cognitive, science, this, interdisciplinary, field, investigates, topics, such, as, the, parallels, between, language, and, music, in, the, brain, biologically, inspired, models, of, computation, are, often, included, in, research, such, as, neural, networks, and, evolutionary, programs, this, field, seeks, to, model, how, musical, knowledge, is, represented, stored, perceived, performed, and, generated, by, using, a, well, structured, computer, environment, the, systematic, structures, of, these, cognitive, phenomena, can, be, investigated, psychoacoustics, is, the, scientific, study, of, sound, perception, more, specifically, it, is, the, branch, of, science, studying, the, psychological, and, physiological, responses, associated, with, sound, including, speech, and, music, it, can, be, further, categorized, as, a, branch, of, psychophysics, evolutionary, musicology, concerns, the, origins, of, music, the, question, of, animal, song, selection, pressures, underlying, music, evolution, and, music, evolution, and, human, evolution, it, seeks, to, understand, music, perception, and, activity, in, the, context, of, evolutionary, theory, charles, darwin, speculated, that, music, may, have, held, an, adaptive, advantage, and, functioned, as, a, protolanguage, a, view, which, has, spawned, several, competing, theories, of, music, evolution, an, alternate, view, sees, music, as, a, by, product, of, linguistic, evolution, a, type, of, auditory, cheesecake, that, pleases, the, senses, without, providing, any, adaptive, function, this, view, has, been, directly, countered, by, numerous, music, researchers, an, individual, s, culture, or, ethnicity, plays, a, role, in, their, music, cognition, including, their, preferences, emotional, reaction, and, musical, memory, musical, preferences, are, biased, toward, culturally, familiar, musical, traditions, beginning, in, infancy, and, adults, classification, of, the, emotion, of, a, musical, piece, depends, on, both, culturally, specific, and, universal, structural, features, additionally, individuals, musical, memory, abilities, are, greater, for, culturally, familiar, music, than, for, culturally, unfamiliar, music, since, the, emergence, of, the, study, of, psychoacoustics, in, the, 1930s, most, lists, of, elements, of, music, have, related, more, to, how, we, hear, music, than, how, we, learn, to, play, it, or, study, it, c, e, seashore, in, his, book, psychology, of, music, identified, four, psychological, attributes, of, sound, these, were, pitch, loudness, time, and, timbre, p, 3, he, did, not, call, them, the, elements, of, music, but, referred, to, them, as, elemental, components, p, 2, nonetheless, these, elemental, components, link, precisely, with, four, of, the, most, common, musical, elements, pitch, and, timbre, match, exactly, loudness, links, with, dynamics, and, time, links, with, the, time, based, elements, of, rhythm, duration, and, tempo, this, usage, of, the, phrase, the, elements, of, music, links, more, closely, with, webster, s, new, 20th, century, dictionary, definition, of, an, element, as, a, substance, which, cannot, be, divided, into, a, simpler, form, by, known, methods, and, educational, institutions, lists, of, elements, generally, align, with, this, definition, as, well, although, writers, of, lists, of, rudimentary, elements, of, music, can, vary, their, lists, depending, on, their, personal, or, institutional, priorities, the, perceptual, elements, of, music, should, consist, of, an, established, or, proven, list, of, discrete, elements, which, can, be, independently, manipulated, to, achieve, an, intended, musical, effect, it, seems, at, this, stage, that, there, is, still, research, to, be, done, in, this, area, a, slightly, different, way, of, approaching, the, identification, of, the, elements, of, music, is, to, identify, the, elements, of, sound, as, pitch, duration, loudness, timbre, sonic, texture, and, spatial, location, and, then, to, define, the, elements, of, music, as, sound, structure, and, artistic, intent, ethnographic, studies, demonstrate, that, music, is, a, participatory, community, based, activity, music, is, experienced, by, individuals, in, a, range, of, social, settings, from, being, alone, to, attending, a, large, concert, forming, a, music, community, which, cannot, be, understood, as, a, function, of, individual, will, or, accident, it, includes, both, commercial, and, non, commercial, participants, with, a, shared, set, of, common, values, musical, performances, take, different, forms, in, different, cultures, and, socioeconomic, milieus, in, europe, and, north, america, there, was, a, divide, between, what, types, of, music, were, viewed, as, high, culture, and, low, culture, high, culture, included, baroque, classical, romantic, and, modern, era, symphonies, concertos, and, solo, works, and, are, typically, heard, in, formal, concerts, in, concert, halls, and, churches, with, the, audience, sitting, quietly, other, types, of, music, including, jazz, blues, soul, and, country, are, often, performed, in, bars, nightclubs, and, theatres, where, the, audience, may, drink, dance, and, cheer, until, the, 20th, century, the, division, between, high, and, low, musical, forms, was, accepted, as, a, valid, distinction, that, separated, out, art, music, from, popular, music, heard, in, bars, and, dance, halls, musicologists, such, as, david, brackett, note, a, redrawing, of, high, low, cultural, aesthetic, boundaries, in, the, 20th, century, and, when, industry, and, public, discourses, link, categories, of, music, with, categories, of, people, they, tend, to, conflate, stereotypes, with, actual, listening, communities, stereotypes, can, be, based, on, socioeconomic, standing, or, social, class, of, the, performers, or, audience, of, the, different, types, of, music, when, composers, introduce, styles, of, music, that, break, with, convention, there, can, be, strong, resistance, from, academics, and, others, late, period, beethoven, string, quartets, stravinsky, ballet, scores, serialism, bebop, hip, hop, punk, rock, and, electronica, were, controversial, and, criticised, when, they, were, first, introduced, such, themes, are, examined, in, the, sociology, of, music, sometimes, called, sociomusicology, which, is, pursued, in, departments, of, sociology, media, studies, or, music, and, is, closely, related, to, ethnomusicology, women, have, played, a, major, role, in, music, throughout, history, as, composers, songwriters, instrumental, performers, singers, conductors, music, scholars, music, educators, music, critics, music, journalists, and, other, musical, professions, in, the, 2010s, while, women, comprise, a, significant, proportion, of, popular, music, and, classical, music, singers, and, a, significant, proportion, of, songwriters, many, of, them, being, singer, songwriters, there, are, few, women, record, producers, rock, critics, and, rock, instrumentalists, although, there, have, been, a, huge, number, of, women, composers, in, classical, music, from, the, medieval, period, to, the, present, day, women, composers, are, significantly, underrepresented, in, the, commonly, performed, classical, music, repertoire, music, history, textbooks, and, music, encyclopedias, for, example, in, the, concise, oxford, history, of, music, clara, schumann, is, one, of, the, few, female, composers, who, is, mentioned, women, comprise, a, significant, proportion, of, instrumental, soloists, in, classical, music, and, the, percentage, of, women, in, orchestras, is, increasing, a, 2015, article, on, concerto, soloists, in, major, canadian, orchestras, however, indicated, that, 84, of, the, soloists, with, the, montreal, symphony, orchestra, were, men, in, 2012, women, still, made, up, just, 6, of, the, top, ranked, vienna, philharmonic, orchestra, women, are, less, common, as, instrumental, players, in, popular, music, genres, such, as, rock, and, heavy, metal, although, there, have, been, a, number, of, notable, female, instrumentalists, and, all, female, bands, women, are, particularly, underrepresented, in, extreme, metal, genres, in, the, 1960s, pop, music, scene, ike, most, aspects, of, the, music, business, songwriting, was, a, male, dominated, field, though, there, were, plenty, of, female, singers, on, the, radio, women, were, primarily, seen, as, consumers, singing, was, sometimes, an, acceptable, pastime, for, a, girl, but, playing, an, instrument, writing, songs, or, producing, records, simply, wasn, t, done, young, women, were, not, socialized, to, see, themselves, as, people, who, create, women, are, also, underrepresented, in, orchestral, conducting, music, criticism, music, journalism, music, producing, and, sound, engineering, while, women, were, discouraged, from, composing, in, the, 19th, century, and, there, are, few, women, musicologists, women, became, involved, in, music, education, to, such, a, degree, that, women, dominated, during, the, later, half, of, the, 19th, century, and, well, into, the, 20th, century, according, to, jessica, duchen, a, music, writer, for, london, s, the, independent, women, musicians, in, classical, music, are, too, often, judged, for, their, appearances, rather, than, their, talent, and, they, face, pressure, to, look, sexy, onstage, and, in, photos, duchen, states, that, while, here, are, women, musicians, who, refuse, to, play, on, their, looks, the, ones, who, do, tend, to, be, more, materially, successful, according, to, the, uk, s, radio, 3, editor, edwina, wolstencroft, the, music, industry, has, long, been, open, to, having, women, in, performance, or, entertainment, roles, but, women, are, much, less, likely, to, have, positions, of, authority, such, as, being, the, conductor, of, an, orchestra, in, popular, music, while, there, are, many, women, singers, recording, songs, there, are, very, few, women, behind, the, audio, console, acting, as, music, producers, the, individuals, who, direct, and, manage, the, recording, process, one, of, the, most, recorded, artists, is, asha, bhosle, an, indian, singer, best, known, as, a, playback, singer, in, hindi, cinema, since, the, 20th, century, live, music, can, be, broadcast, over, the, radio,

performers, can, follow, the, lyrics, as, they, sing, over, the, instrumental, tracks, the, advent, of, the, internet, and, widespread, high, speed, broadband, access, has, transformed, the, experience, of, music, partly, through, the, increased, ease, of, access, to, recordings, of, music, via, streaming, video, and, vastly, increased, choice, of, music, for, consumers, another, effect, of, the, internet, arose, with, online, communities, and, social, media, websites, like, youtube, and, facebook, a, social, networking, service, these, sites, make, it, easier, for, aspiring, singers, and, amateur, bands, to, distribute, videos, of, their, songs, connect, with, other, musicians, and, gain, audience, interest, professional, musicians, also, use, youtube, as, a, free, publisher, of, promotional, material, youtube, users, for, example, no, longer, only, download, and, listen, to, mp3s, but, also, actively, create, their, own, according, to, don, tapscott, and, anthony, d, williams, in, their, book, wikinomics, there, has, been, a, shift, from, a, traditional, consumer, role, to, what, they, call, a, prosumer, role, a, consumer, who, both, creates, content, and, consumes, manifestations, of, this, in, music, include, the, production, of, mashes, remixes, and, music, videos, by, fans, the, incorporation, of, music, into, general, education, from, preschool, to, post, secondary, education, is, common, in, north, america, and, europe, involvement, in, playing, and, singing, music, is, thought, to, teach, basic, skills, such, as, concentration, counting, listening, and, cooperation, while, also, promoting, understanding, of, language, improving, the, ability, to, recall, information, and, creating, an, environment, more, conducive, to, learning, in, other, areas, in, elementary, schools, children, often, learn, to, play, instruments, such, as, the, recorder, sing, in, small, choirs, and, learn, about, the, history, of, western, art, music, and, traditional, music, some, elementary, school, children, also, learn, about, popular, music, styles, in, religious, schools, children, sing, hymns, and, other, religious, music, in, secondary, schools, and, less, commonly, in, elementary, schools, students, may, have, the, opportunity, to, perform, in, some, types, of, musical, ensembles, such, as, choirs, a, group, of, singers, marching, bands,

school, with, a, singing, teacher, or, instrument, teacher, amateur, musicians, typically, learn, basic, musical, rudiments, e, g, learning, about, musical, notation, for, musical, scales, and, rhythms, and, beginner, to, intermediate, level, singing, or, instrument, playing, techniques, at, the, university, level, students, in, most, arts, and, humanities, programs, can, receive, credit, for, taking, a, few, music, courses, which, typically, take, the, form, of, an, overview, course, on, the, history, of, music, or, a, music, appreciation, course, that, focuses, on, listening, to, music, and, learning, about, different, musical, styles, in, addition, most, north, american, and, european, universities, have, some, types, of, musical, ensembles, that, students, in, arts, and, humanities, are, able, to, participate, in, such, as, choirs, marching, bands, concert, bands, or, orchestras, the, study, of, western, art, music, is, increasingly, common, outside, of, north, america, and, europe, such, as, the, indonesian, institute, of, the, arts, in, yogyakarta, indonesia, or, the, classical, music, programs, that, are, available, in, asian, countries, such, as, south, korea, japan, and, china, at, the, same, time, western, universities, and, colleges, are, widening, their, curriculum, to, include, music, of, non, western, cultures, such, as, the, music, of, africa,

in, amateur, bands, cover, bands, and, tribute, bands, studying, recordings, on, dvd, and, the, internet, and, working, with, already, established, professionals, in, their, style, of, music, either, through, informal, mentoring, or, regular, music, lessons, since, the, 2000s, the, increasing, popularity, and, availability, of, internet, forums, and, youtube, how, to, videos, have, enabled,

musicology, the, academic, study, of, music, is, studied, in, universities, and, music, conservatories, the, earliest, definitions, from, the, 19th, century, defined, three, sub, disciplines, of, musicology, systematic, musicology, historical, musicology, and, comparative, musicology, or, ethnomusicology, in, 2010, era, scholarship, one, is, more, likely, to, encounter, a, division, into, music, theory, music, history, and, ethnomusicology, research, in, musicology, has, often, been, enriched, by, cross, disciplinary, work, for, example, in, the, field, of, psychoacoustics, the, study, of, music, of, non, western, cultures, and, cultural, study, of, music, is, called, ethnomusicology, students, can, pursue, study, of, musicology, ethnomusicology, music, history, and, music, theory, through, different, types, of, degrees, including, bachelor, s, master, s, and, phd, music, theory, is, the, study, of, music, generally, in, a, highly, technical, manner, outside, of, other, disciplines, more, broadly, it, refers, to, any, study, of, music, usually, related, in, some, form, with, compositional, concerns, and, may, include, mathematics, physics, and, anthropology, what, is, most, commonly, taught, in, beginning, music, theory, classes, are, guidelines, to, write, in, the, style, of, the, common, practice, period, or, tonal, music, theory, even, of, music, of, the, common, practice, period, may, take, other, forms, musical, set, theory, is, the, application, of, mathematical, set, theory, to, music, first, applied, to, atonal, music, speculative, music, theory, contrasted, with, analytic, music, theory, is, devoted, to, the, analysis, and, synthesis, of, music, materials, for, example, tuning, systems, generally, as, preparation, for, composition,
