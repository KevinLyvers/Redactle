in, modern, times, with, johnstone, exploring, improvisation, as, an, alternative, to, scripted, theatre, and, spolin, and, her, successors, exploring, improvisation, principally, as, a, tool, for, developing, dramatic, work, or, skills, or, as, a, form, for, situational, comedy, spolin, also, became, interested, in, how, the, process, of, learning, improvisation, was, applicable, to, the, development, of, human, potential, spolin, s, son, paul, sills, popularized, improvisational, theatre, as, a, theatrical, art, form, when, he, founded, as, its, first, director, the, second, city, in, chicago, having, been, an, important, part, of, human, culture, for, more, than, 2, 500, years, theatre, has, evolved, a, wide, range, of, different, theories, and, practices, some, are, related, to, political, or, spiritual, ideologies, while, others, are, based, purely, on, artistic, concerns, some, processes, focus, on, a, story, some, on, theatre, as, event, and, some, on, theatre, as, catalyst, for, social, change, the, classical, greek, philosopher, aristotle, in, his, seminal, treatise, poetics, c, 335, bce, is, the, earliest, surviving, example, and, its, arguments, have, influenced, theories, of, theatre, ever, since, in, it, he, offers, an, account, of, what, he, calls, poetry, a, term, which, in, greek, literally, means, making, and, in, this, context, includes, drama, comedy, tragedy, and, the, satyr, play, as, well, as, lyric, poetry, epic, poetry, and, the, dithyramb, he, examines, its, first, principles, and, identifies, its, genres, and, basic, elements, his, analysis, of, tragedy, constitutes, the, core, of, the, discussion, aristotle, argues, that, tragedy, consists, of, six, qualitative, parts, which, are, in, order, of, importance, mythos, or, plot, ethos, or, character, dianoia, or, thought, lexis, or, diction, melos, or, song, and, opsis, or, spectacle, although, aristotle, s, poetics, is, universally, acknowledged, in, the, western, critical, tradition, marvin, carlson, explains, almost, every, detail, about, his, seminal, work, has, aroused, divergent, opinions, important, theatre, practitioners, of, the, 20th, century, include, konstantin, stanislavski, vsevolod, meyerhold, jacques, copeau, edward, gordon, craig, bertolt, brecht, antonin, artaud, joan, littlewood, peter, brook, jerzy, grotowski, augusto, boal, eugenio,

the, playwright, s, contribution, should, be, respected, as, that, of, only, one, of, an, ensemble, of, creative, artists, his, innovative, contribution, to, modern, acting, theory, has, remained, at, the, core, of, mainstream, western, performance, training, for, much, of, the, last, century, that, many, of, the, precepts, of, his, system, of, actor, training, seem, to, be, common, sense, and, self, evident, testifies, to, its, hegemonic, success, actors, frequently, employ, his, basic, concepts, without, knowing, they, do, so, thanks, to, its, promotion, and, elaboration, by, acting, teachers, who, were, former, students, and, the, many, translations, of, his, theoretical, writings, stanislavski, s, system, acquired, an, unprecedented, ability, to, cross, cultural, boundaries, and, developed, an, international, reach, dominating, debates, about, acting, in, europe, and, the, united, states, many, actors, routinely, equate, his, system, with, the, north, american, method, although, the, latter, s, exclusively, psychological, techniques, contrast, sharply, with, stanislavski, s, multivariant, holistic, and, psychophysical, approach, which, explores, character, and, action, both, from, the, inside, out, and, the, outside, in, and, treats, the, actor, s, mind, and, body, as, parts, of, a, continuum, theatre, presupposes, collaborative, modes, of, production, and, a, collective, form, of, reception, the, structure, of, dramatic, texts, unlike, other, forms, of, literature, is, directly, influenced, by, this, collaborative, production, and, collective, reception, the, production, of, plays, usually, involves, contributions, from, a, playwright, director, a, cast, of, actors, and, a, technical, production, team, that, includes, a, scenic, or, set, designer, lighting, designer, costume, designer, sound, designer, stage, manager, production, manager, and, technical, director, depending, on, the, production, this, team, may, also, include, a, composer, dramaturg, video, designer, or, fight, director, stagecraft, is, a, generic, term, referring, to, the, technical, aspects, of, theatrical, film, and, video, production, it, includes, but, is, not, limited, to, constructing, and, rigging, scenery, hanging, and, focusing, of, lighting, design, and, procurement, of, costumes, makeup, procurement, of, props, stage, management, and, recording, and, mixing, of, sound, stagecraft, is, distinct, from, the, wider, umbrella, term, of, scenography, considered, a, technical, rather, than, an, artistic, field, it, relates, primarily, to, the, practical, implementation, of, a, designer, s, artistic, vision, in, its, most, basic, form, stagecraft, is, managed, by, a, single, person, often, the, stage, manager, of, a, smaller, production, who, arranges, all, scenery, costumes, lighting, and, sound, and, organizes, the, cast, at, a, more, professional, level, for, example, in, modern, broadway, houses, stagecraft, is, managed, by, hundreds, of, skilled, carpenters, painters, electricians, stagehands, stitchers, wigmakers, and, the, like, this, modern, form, of, stagecraft, is, highly, technical, and, specialized, it, comprises, many, subdisciplines, and, a, vast, trove, of, history, and, tradition, the, majority, of, stagecraft, lies, between, these, two, extremes, regional, theatres, and, larger, community, theatres, will, generally, have, a, technical, director, and, a, complement, of, designers, each, of, whom, has, a, direct, hand, in, their, respective, designs, there, are, many, modern, theatre, movements, which, produce, theatre, in, a, variety, of, ways, theatrical, enterprises, vary, enormously, in, sophistication, and, purpose, people, who, are, involved, vary, from, novices, and, hobbyists, in, community, theatre, to, professionals, in, broadway, and, similar, productions, theatre, can, be, performed, with, a, shoestring, budget, or, on, a, grand, scale, with, multimillion, dollar, budgets, this, diversity, manifests, in, the, abundance, of, theatre, subcategories, which, include, while, most, modern, theatre, companies, rehearse, one, piece, of, theatre, at, a, time, perform, that, piece, for, a, set, run, retire, the, piece, and, begin, rehearsing, a, new, show, repertory, companies, rehearse, multiple, shows, at, one, time, these, companies, are, able, to, perform, these, various, pieces, upon, request, and, often, perform, works, for, years, before, retiring, them, most, dance, companies, operate, on, this, repertory, system, the, royal, national, theatre, in, london, performs, on, a, repertory, system, repertory, theatre, generally, involves, a, group, of, similarly, accomplished, actors, and, relies, more, on, the, reputation, of, the, group, than, on, an, individual, star, actor, it, also, typically, relies, less, on, strict, control, by, a, director, and, less, on, adherence, to, theatrical, conventions, since, actors, who, have, worked, together, in, multiple, productions, can, respond, to, each, other, without, relying, as, much, on, convention, or, external, direction, a, theatre, company, is, an, organisation, that, produces, theatrical, performances, as, distinct, from, a, theatre, troupe, or, acting, company, which, is, a, group, of, theatrical, performers, working, together, a, touring, company, is, an, independent, theatre, or, dance, company, that, travels, often, internationally, being, presented, at, a, different, theatre, venue, in, each, city, in, order, to, put, on, a, piece, of, theatre, both, a, theatre, company, and, a, theatre, venue, are, needed, when, a, theatre, company, is, the, sole, company, in, residence, at, a, theatre, venue, this, theatre, and, its, corresponding, theatre, company, are, called, a, resident, theatre, or, a, producing, theatre, because, the, venue, produces, its, own, work, other, theatre, companies, as, well, as, dance, companies, who, do, not, have, their, own, theatre, venue, perform, at, rental, theatres, or, at, presenting, theatres, both, rental, and, presenting, theatres, have, no, full, time, resident, companies, they, do, however, sometimes, have, one, or, more, part, time, resident, companies, in, addition, to, other, independent, partner, companies, who, arrange, to, use, the, space, when, available, a, rental, theatre, allows, the, independent, companies, to, seek, out, the, space, while, a, presenting, theatre, seeks, out, the, independent, companies, to, support, their, work, by, presenting, them, on, their, stage, some, performance, groups, perform, in, non, theatrical, spaces, such, performances, can, take, place, outside, or, inside, in, a, non, traditional, performance, space, and, include, street, theatre, and,
