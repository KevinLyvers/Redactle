the, tempest, is, a, play, by, william, shakespeare, probably, written, in, 1610, 1611, and, thought, to, be, one, of, the, last, plays, that, he, wrote, alone, after, the, first, scene, which, takes, place, on, a, ship, at, sea, during, a, tempest, the, rest, of, the, story, is, set, on, a, remote, island, where, prospero, a, wizard, lives, with, his, daughter, miranda, and, his, two, servants, caliban, a, savage, monster, figure, and, ariel, an, airy, spirit, the, play, contains, music, and, songs, that, evoke, the, spirit, of, enchantment, on, the, island, it, explores, many, themes, including, magic, betrayal, revenge, and, family, in, act, iv, a, wedding, masque, serves, as, a, play, within, a, play, and, contributes, spectacle, allegory, and, elevated, language, although, the, tempest, is, listed, in, the, first, folio, as, the, first, of, shakespeare, s, comedies, it, deals, with, both, tragic, and, comic, themes, and, modern, criticism, has, created, a, category, of, romance, for, this, and, others, of, shakespeare, s, late, plays, the, tempest, has, been, put, to, varied, interpretations, from, those, that, see, it, as, a, fable, of, art, and, creation, with, prospero, representing, shakespeare, and, prospero, s, renunciation, of, magic, signaling, shakespeare, s, farewell, to, the, stage, to, interpretations, that, consider, it, an, allegory, of, europeans, colonizing, foreign, lands, twelve, years, before, the, action, of, the, play, prospero, formerly, duke, of, milan, and, a, gifted, sorcerer, had, been, usurped, by, his, treacherous, brother, antonio, with, the, aid, of, alonso, king, of, naples, escaping, by, boat, with, his, infant, daughter, miranda, prospero, flees, to, a, remote, island, where, he, has, been, living, ever, since, using, his, magic, to, force, the, island, s, only, inhabitant, caliban, to, protect, him, and, miranda, he, also, frees, the, spirit, ariel, and, binds, them, into, servitude, when, a, ship, carrying, his, brother, antonio, passes, nearby, prospero, conjures, up, a, storm, with, help, from, ariel, and, the, ship, is, destroyed, antonio, is, shipwrecked, along, with, alonso, ferdinand, alonso, s, son, and, heir, to, the, throne, sebastian, alonso, s, brother, gonzalo, prospero, s, trustworthy, minister, adrian, and, other, court, members, prospero, enacts, a, sophisticated, plan, to, take, revenge, on, his, usurpers, and, regain, his, dukedom, using, magic, he, separates, the, shipwreck, survivors, into, groups, on, the, island, prospero, intends, that, miranda, now, aged, 15, will, marry, ferdinand, and, he, instructs, ariel, to, bring, some, other, spirits, and, produce, a, masque, the, masque, will, feature, classical, goddesses, juno, ceres, and, iris, and, will, bless, and, celebrate, the, betrothal, the, masque, will, also, instruct, the, young, couple, on, marriage, and, on, the, value, of, chastity, until, then, the, masque, is, suddenly, interrupted, when, prospero, realises, he, had, forgotten, the, plot, against, his, life, once, ferdinand, and, miranda, are, gone, prospero, orders, ariel, to, deal, with, the, nobles, plot, caliban, trinculo, and, stephano, are, then, chased, off, into, the, swamps, by, goblins, in, the, shape, of, hounds, prospero, vows, that, once, he, achieves, his, goals, he, will, set, ariel, free, and, abandon, his, magic, saying, i, ll, break, my, staff, bury, it, certain, fathoms, in, the, earth, and, deeper, than, did, ever, plummet, sound, i, ll, drown, my, book, ariel, brings, on, alonso, antonio, and, sebastian, prospero, forgives, all, three, prospero, s, former, title, duke, of, milan, is, restored, ariel, fetches, the, sailors, from, the, ship, and, then, caliban, trinculo, and, stephano, caliban, seemingly, filled, with, regret, promises, to, be, good, stephano, and, trinculo, are, ridiculed, and, sent, away, in, shame, by, prospero, before, the, reunited, group, all, the, noble, characters, plus, miranda, and, prospero, leave, the, island, ariel, is, instructed, to, provide, good, weather, to, guide, the, king, s, ship, back, to, the, royal, fleet, and, then, to, naples, where, ferdinand, and, miranda, will, be, married, after, this, ariel, is, set, free, in, an, epilogue, prospero, requests, that, the, audience, set, him, free, with, their, applause, the, tempest, begins, with, the, spectacle, of, a, storm, tossed, ship, at, sea, and, later, there, is, a, second, spectacle, the, masque, a, masque, in, renaissance, england, was, a, festive, courtly, entertainment, that, offered, music, dance, elaborate, sets, costumes, and, drama, often, a, masque, would, begin, with, an, anti, masque, that, showed, a, disordered, scene, of, satyrs, for, example, singing, and, dancing, wildly, the, anti, masque, would, then, be, dramatically, dispersed, by, the, spectacular, arrival, of, the, masque, proper, in, a, demonstration, of, chaos, and, vice, being, swept, away, by, glorious, civilisation, in, shakespeare, s, play, the, storm, in, scene, one, functions, as, the, anti, masque, for, the, masque, proper, in, act, four, the, masque, in, the, tempest, is, not, an, actual, masque, rather, it, is, an, analogous, scene, intended, to, mimic, and, evoke, a, masque, while, serving, the, narrative, of, the, drama, that, contains, it, the, masque, is, a, culmination, of, the, primary, action, in, the, tempest, prospero, s, intention, to, not, only, seek, revenge, on, his, usurpers, but, to, regain, his, rightful, position, as, duke, of, milan, most, important, to, his, plot, to, regain, his, power, and, position, is, to, marry, miranda, to, ferdinand, heir, to, the, king, of, naples, this, marriage, will, secure, prospero, s, position, by, securing, his, legacy, the, chastity, of, the, bride, is, considered, essential, and, greatly, valued, in, royal, lineages, this, is, true, not, only, in, prospero, s, plot, but, also, notably, in, the, court, of, the, virgin, queen, elizabeth, sir, walter, raleigh, had, in, fact, named, one, of, the, new, world, colonies, virginia, after, his, monarch, s, chastity, it, was, also, understood, by, james, king, when, the, tempest, was, first, produced, as, he, arranged, political, marriages, for, his, grandchildren, what, could, possibly, go, wrong, with, prospero, s, plans, for, his, daughter, is, nature, the, fact, that, miranda, is, a, young, woman, who, has, just, arrived, at, a, time, in, her, life, when, natural, attractions, among, young, people, become, powerful, one, threat, is, the, 24, year, old, caliban, who, has, spoken, of, his, desire, to, rape, miranda, and, people, this, isle, with, calibans, and, who, has, also, offered, miranda, s, body, to, a, drunken, stephano, another, threat, is, represented, by, the, young, couple, themselves, who, might, succumb, to, each, other, prematurely, prospero, says, look, though, be, true, do, not, give, dalliance, too, much, the, rein, the, strongest, oaths, are, straw, to, th, fire, i, th, blood, be, more, abstemious, or, else, good, night, your, vow, prospero, keenly, aware, of, all, this, feels, the, need, to, teach, miranda, an, intention, he, first, stated, in, act, one, the, need, to, teach, miranda, is, what, inspires, prospero, in, act, four, to, create, the, masque, and, the, value, of, chastity, is, a, primary, lesson, being, taught, by, the, masque, along, with, having, a, happy, marriage, it, is, not, known, for, certain, exactly, when, the, tempest, was, written, but, evidence, supports, the, idea, that, it, was, probably, composed, sometime, between, late, 1610, to, mid, 1611, it, is, considered, one, of, the, last, plays, that, shakespeare, wrote, alone, evidence, supports, composition, perhaps, occurring, before, after, or, at, the, same, time, as, the, winter, s, tale, edward, blount, entered, the, tempest, into, the, stationers, register, on, 8, november, 1623, it, was, one, of, 16, shakespeare, plays, that, blount, registered, on, that, date, there, is, no, obvious, single, origin, for, the, plot, of, the, tempest, it, appears, to, have, been, created, with, several, sources, contributing, chiefly, william, strachey, s, letter, to, an, excellent, lady, since, source, scholarship, began, in, the, eighteenth, century, researchers, have, suggested, passages, from, naufragium, the, shipwreck, one, of, the, colloquies, in, erasmus, s, colloquia, familiaria, 1518, and, richard, eden, s, 1555, translation, of, peter, martyr, s, de, orbo, novo, 1530, william, strachey, s, a, true, reportory, of, the, wracke, and, redemption, of, sir, thomas, gates, knight, an, eyewitness, report, of, the, real, life, shipwreck, of, the, sea, venture, in, 1609, on, the, island, of, bermuda, while, sailing, toward, virginia, may, be, considered, a, primary, source, for, the, opening, scene, as, well, as, a, few, other, references, in, the, play, to, conspiracies, and, retributions, although, not, published, until, 1625, strachey, s, report, was, first, recounted, in, his, letter, to, an, excellent, lady, a, private, letter, describing, the, incident, and, the, earliest, account, of, all, the, letter, was, dated, 15, july, 1610, and, it, is, thought, that, shakespeare, may, have, seen, the, original, sometime, during, that, year, e, k, chambers, identified, the, true, reportory, as, shakespeare, s, main, authority, for, the, tempest, despite, the, fact, that, it, was, published, in, 1625, regarding, the, influence, of, strachey, in, the, play, kenneth, muir, says, that, although, here, is, little, doubt, that, shakespeare, had, read, william, strachey, s, true, reportory, and, other, accounts, he, extent, of, the, verbal, echoes, of, pamphlets, has, i, think, been, exaggerated, there, is, hardly, a, shipwreck, in, history, or, fiction, which, does, not, mention, splitting, in, which, the, ship, is, not, lightened, of, its, cargo, in, which, the, passengers, do, not, give, themselves, up, for, lost, in, which, north, winds, are, not, sharp, and, in, which, no, one, gets, to, shore, by, clinging, to, wreckage, and, goes, on, to, say, that, strachey, s, account, of, the, shipwreck, is, blended, with, memories, of, saint, paul, s, in, which, too, not, a, hair, perished, and, with, erasmus, colloquy, shakespeare, almost, certainly, read, strachey, s, account, from, the, original, source, according, to, charles, mills, gayley, gayley, posits, that, shakespeare, had, access, to, strachey, s, original, letter, to, an, excellent, lady, brought, to, england, by, sir, thomas, gates, the, summer, of, 1610, the, letter, was, entrusted, by, this, lady, to, certain, members, of, the, council, and, one, of, them, probably, sir, edwin, sandys, incorporated, from, it, such, portions, as, were, fitting, for, the, true, declaration, issued, to, the, public, the, letter, was, always, in, the, keeping, of, those, vitally, concerned, until, purchas, got, hold, of, it, that, shakespeare, was, allowed, to, read, it, and, to, use, certain, of, its, materials, for, a, play, as, with, just, discrimination, and, due, discretion, as, he, did, is, illustrative, of, the, closeness, of, his, intimacy, with, the, patriot, leaders, of, the, virginia, enterprise, the, character, of, stephano, has, been, identified, with, stephen, hopkins, who, later, signed, the, mayflower, compact, another, sea, venture, survivor, silvester, jourdain, published, his, account, a, discovery, of, the, barmudas, dated, 13, october, 1610, edmond, malone, argues, for, the, 1610, 11, date, on, the, account, by, jourdain, and, the, virginia, council, of, london, s, a, true, declaration, of, the, estate, of, the, colonie, in, virginia, dated, 8, november, 1610, michel, de, montaigne, s, essay, of, the, caniballes, is, considered, a, source, for, gonzalo, s, utopian, speculations, in, act, ii, scene, 1, and, possibly, for, other, lines, that, refer, to, differences, between, cultures, a, poem, entitled, pimlyco, or, runne, red, cap, was, published, as, a, pamphlet, in, 1609, it, was, written, in, praise, of, a, tavern, in, hoxton, the, poem, includes, extensive, quotations, of, an, earlier, 1568, poem, the, tunning, of, elynor, rymming, by, john, skelton, the, pamphlet, contains, a, pastoral, story, of, a, voyage, to, an, island, there, is, no, evidence, that, shakespeare, read, this, pamphlet, was, aware, of, it, or, had, used, it, however, the, poem, may, be, useful, as, a, source, to, researchers, regarding, how, such, themes, and, stories, were, being, interpreted, and, told, in, london, near, to, the, time, the, tempest, was, written, the, tempest, may, take, its, overall, structure, from, traditional, italian, commedia, dell, arte, which, sometimes, featured, a, magus, and, his, daughter, their, supernatural, attendants, and, a, number, of, rustics, the, commedia, often, featured, a, clown, known, as, arlecchino, or, his, predecessor, zanni, and, his, partner, brighella, who, bear, a, striking, resemblance, to, stephano, and, trinculo, a, lecherous, neapolitan, hunchback, who, corresponds, to, caliban, and, the, clever, and, beautiful, isabella, whose, wealthy, and, manipulative, father, pantalone, constantly, seeks, a, suitor, for, her, thus, mirroring, the, relationship, between, miranda, and, prospero,

plays, entitled, mr, william, shakespeare, s, comedies, histories, tragedies, published, according, to, the, true, and, original, copies, which, is, known, as, the, first, folio, the, plays, including, the, tempest, were, gathered, and, edited, by, john, heminges, and, henry, condell, a, handwritten, manuscript, of, the, tempest, was, prepared, by, ralph, crane, a, scrivener, employed, by, the, king, s, men, a, scrivener, is, one, who, has, a, talent, and, is, practiced, at, using, a, quill, pen, and, ink, to, create, legible, manuscripts, crane, probably, copied, from, shakespeare, s, rough, draft, and, based, his, style, on, ben, jonson, s, folio, of, 1616, crane, is, thought, to, have, neatened, texts, edited, the, divisions, of, acts, and, scenes, and, sometimes, added, his, own, improvements, he, was, fond, of, joining, words, with, hyphens, and, using, elisions, with, apostrophes, for, example, by, changing, with, the, king, to, read, w, th, king, the, elaborate, stage, directions, in, the, tempest, may, have, been, due, to, crane, they, provide, evidence, regarding, how, the, play, was, staged, by, the, king, s, company, the, entire, first, folio, project, was, delivered, to, the, blind, printer, william, jaggard, and, printing, began, in, 1622, the, tempest, is, the, first, play, in, the, publication, it, was, proofread, and, printed, with, special, care, it, is, the, most, well, printed, and, the, cleanest, text, of, the, thirty, six, plays, to, do, the, work, of, setting, the, type, in, the, printing, press, three, compositors, were, used, for, the, tempest, in, the, 1960s, a, landmark, bibliographic, study, of, the, first, folio, was, accomplished, by, charlton, hinman, based, on, distinctive, quirks, in, the, printed, words, on, the, page, the, study, was, able, to, individuate, the, compositors, and, reveal, that, three, compositors, worked, on, the, tempest, who, are, known, as, compositor, b, c, and, f, compositor, b, worked, on, the, tempest, s, first, page, as, well, as, six, other, pages, he, was, an, experienced, journeyman, in, jaggard, s, printshop, who, occasionally, could, be, careless, he, also, was, fond, of, dashes, and, colons, where, modern, editions, use, commas, in, his, role, he, may, have, had, a, responsibility, for, the, entire, first, folio, the, other, two, compositors, c, and, f, worked, full, time, and, were, experienced, printers, at, the, time, spelling, and, punctuation, was, not, standardized, and, will, vary, from, page, to, page, because, each, compositor, had, their, individual, preferences, and, styles, there, is, evidence, that, the, press, run, was, stopped, at, least, four, times, which, allowed, proofreading, and, corrections, however, a, page, with, an, error, would, not, be, discarded, so, pages, late, in, any, given, press, run, would, be, the, most, accurate, and, each, of, the, final, printed, folios, may, vary, in, this, regard, this, is, the, common, practice, at, the, time, there, is, also, an, instance, of, a, letter, a, metal, sort, or, a, type, being, damaged, possibly, during, the, course, of, a, run, and, changing, the, meaning, of, a, word, after, the, masque, ferdinand, says, let, me, live, here, ever, so, rare, a, wondered, father, and, a, wise, makes, this, place, paradise, 4, 1, 122, 124, the, word, wise, at, the, end, of, line, 123, was, printed, with, the, traditional, long, s, that, resembles, an, f, but, in, 1978, it, was, suggested, that, during, the, press, run, a, small, piece, of, the, crossbar, on, the, type, had, broken, off, and, the, word, should, be, wife, modern, editors, have, not, come, to, an, agreement, oxford, says, wife, arden, says, wise, our, revels, now, are, ended, these, our, actors, as, i, foretold, you, were, all, spirits, and, are, melted, into, air, into, thin, air, and, like, the, baseless, fabric, of, this, vision, the, cloud, capped, towers, the, gorgeous, palaces, the, solemn, temples, the, great, globe, itself, yea, all, which, it, inherit, shall, dissolve, and, like, this, insubstantial, pageant, faded, leave, not, a, rack, behind, we, are, such, stuff, as, dreams, are, made, on, and, our, little, life, is, rounded, with, a, sleep, prospero, act, 4, scene, 1, the, tempest, is, explicitly, concerned, with, its, own, nature, as, a, play, frequently, drawing, links, between, prospero, s, art, and, theatrical, illusion, the, shipwreck, was, a, spectacle, that, ariel, performed, while, antonio, and, sebastian, are, cast, in, a, troupe, to, act, prospero, may, even, refer, to, the, globe, theatre, when, he, describes, the, whole, world, as, an, illusion, the, great, globe, shall, dissolve, like, this, insubstantial, pageant, ariel, frequently, disguises, himself, as, figures, from, classical, mythology, for, example, a, nymph, a, harpy, and, ceres, acting, as, the, latter, in, a, masque, and, anti, masque, that, prospero, creates, thomas, campbell, in, 1838, was, the, first, to, consider, that, prospero, was, meant, to, partially, represent, shakespeare, but, then, abandoned, that, idea, when, he, came, to, believe, that, the, tempest, was, an, early, play, as, it, was, shakespeare, s, last, solo, play, the, tempest, has, often, been, seen, as, a, valedictory, for, his, career, specifically, in, prospero, s, final, speech, in, which, he, tells, the, audience, let, your, indulgence, set, me, free, asking, to, be, released, from, the, stage, one, last, time, before, retiring, prospero, is, a, magician, whose, magic, is, a, beneficial, white, magic, prospero, learned, his, magic, by, studying, in, his, books, about, nature, and, he, uses, magic, to, achieve, what, he, considers, positive, outcomes, shakespeare, uses, caliban, to, indicate, the, opposite, evil, black, magic, caliban, s, mother, sycorax, who, does, not, appear, represents, the, horrors, that, were, stirring, at, this, time, in, england, and, elsewhere, regarding, witchcraft, and, black, magic, magic, was, taken, seriously, and, studied, by, serious, philosophers, notably, the, german, henricus, cornelius, agrippa, who, in, 1533, published, in, three, volumes, his, de, occulta, philosophia, which, summarized, work, done, by, italian, scholars, on, the, topic, of, magic, agrippa, s, work, influenced, john, dee, 1527, 1608, an, englishman, who, like, prospero, had, a, large, collection, of, books, on, the, occult, as, well, as, on, science, and, philosophy, it, was, a, dangerous, time, to, philosophize, about, magic, giordano, bruno, for, example, was, burned, at, the, stake, in, italy, in, 1600, just, a, few, years, before, the, tempest, was, written, prospero, uses, magic, grounded, in, science, and, reality, the, kind, that, was, studied, by, agrippa, and, dee, prospero, studied, and, gradually, was, able, to, develop, the, kind, of, power, represented, by, ariel, which, extended, his, abilities, sycorax, s, magic, was, not, capable, of, something, like, ariel, ariel, is, a, spirit, too, delicate, to, act, her, earthy, and, abhored, commands, prospero, s, rational, goodness, enables, him, to, control, ariel, where, sycorax, can, only, trap, him, in, a, tree, sycorax, s, magic, is, described, as, destructive, and, terrible, where, prospero, s, is, said, to, be, wondrous, and, beautiful, prospero, seeks, to, set, things, right, in, his, world, through, his, magic, and, once, that, is, done, he, renounces, it, setting, ariel, free, what, prospero, is, trying, to, do, with, magic, is, essential, to, the, tempest, it, is, the, unity, of, action, it, is, referred, to, as, prospero, s, project, in, act, two, when, ariel, stops, an, attempted, assassination, my, master, through, his, art, foresees, the, danger, that, you, his, friend, are, in, and, sends, me, forth, for, else, his, project, dies, to, keep, them, living, at, the, start, of, act, five, prospero, says, prospero, seems, to, know, precisely, what, he, wants, beginning, with, the, tempest, at, the, top, of, the, play, his, project, is, laid, out, in, a, series, of, steps, bountiful, fortune, has, given, him, a, chance, to, affect, his, destiny, and, that, of, his, county, and, family, his, plan, is, to, do, all, he, can, to, reverse, what, was, done, twelve, years, ago, when, he, was, usurped, first, he, will, use, a, tempest, to, cause, certain, persons, to, fear, his, great, powers, then, when, all, survived, unscathed, he, will, separate, those, who, lived, through, the, tempest, into, different, groups, these, separations, will, let, him, deal, with, each, group, differently, then, prospero, s, plan, is, to, lead, ferdinand, to, miranda, having, prepared, them, both, for, their, meeting, what, is, beyond, his, magical, powers, is, to, cause, them, to, fall, in, love, but, yet, they, do, the, next, stages, for, the, couple, will, be, a, testing, to, help, things, along, he, magically, makes, the, others, fall, into, a, sleep, the, masque, which, is, to, educate, and, prepare, the, couple, is, next, but, then, his, plans, begin, to, go, off, the, tracks, when, the, masque, is, interrupted, next, prospero, confronts, those, who, usurped, him,

sebastian, and, antonio, who, are, not, penitent, prospero, then, deals, with, antonio, not, with, magic, but, with, something, more, mundane, blackmail, this, failure, of, magic, is, significant, and, critics, disagree, regarding, what, it, means, jan, kott, considers, it, a, disillusionment, for, both, prospero, and, for, the, author, e, m, w, tillyard, plays, it, down, as, a, minor, disappointment, some, critics, consider, sebastian, and, antonio, clownish, and, not, a, real, threat, stephen, orgel, blames, prospero, for, causing, the, problem, by, forgetting, about, sebastian, and, antonio, which, may, introduce, a, theme, of, prospero, s, encroaching, dotage, david, hirst, suggests, that, the, failure, of, prospero, s, magic, may, have, a, deeper, explanation, he, suggests, that, prospero, s, magic, has, had, no, effect, at, all, on, certain, things, like, caliban, that, prospero, is, idealistic, and, not, realistic, and, that, his, magic, makes, prospero, like, a, god, but, it, also, makes, him, other, than, human, which, explains, why, prospero, seems, impatient, and, ill, suited, to, deal, with, his, daughter, for, example, when, issues, call, on, his, humanity, not, his, magic, it, explains, his, dissatisfaction, with, the, real, world, which, is, what, cost, him, his, dukedom, for, example, in, the, first, place, in, the, end, prospero, is, learning, the, value, of, being, human, romance, shakespeare, s, romantic, narrative, appears, in, the, characters, themselves, and, the, island, setting, often, romances, involve, exotic, and, remote, locations, like, this, island, in, the, tempest, the, environment, is, the, home, for, prospero, and, miranda, it, is, also, the, setting, where, one, of, the, shipwrecked, characters, ferdinand, falls, in, love, with, miranda, however, they, are, part, of, a, knight, and, a, princess, situation, romance, will, use, the, theme, of, a, knight, trying, to, win, the, love, of, the, princess, ferdinand, is, an, example, of, fitting, such, a, role, since, he, has, to, work, for, prospero, to, win, respect, and, love, him, to, marry, his, daughter, miranda, comedy, the, tempest, was, initially, presented, as, a, form, of, tragic, comedy, in, the, first, folio, by, john, fletcher, of, shakespeare, s, plays, another, form, of, comedy, that, the, tempest, creates, is, the, concept, of, greek, and, latin, new, comedy, lester, e, barber, s, article, the, tempest, and, new, comedy, suggests, that, the, new, comedy, has, to, do, in, part, with, the, narrative, of, slaves, with, the, characters, of, ariel, and, caliban, both, characters, are, considered, comedic, slaves, because, their, goal, is, to, be, free, from, prospero, s, hold, here, both, characters, differ, in, how, they, present, themselves, as, slaves, arguably, caliban, is, sometimes, considered, a, character, who, is, not, a, part, of, new, comedy, since, he, is, regarded, as, a, convent, vehicle, lester, e, barber, suggests, a, convent, vehicle, is, a, slave, who, does, vile, and, unintelligent, things, that, cause, them, to, fail, miserably, and, be, humiliated, and, punished, caliban, fits, this, through, his, hatred, and, disobedience, to, prospero, ariel, as, a, slave, carries, a, different, approach, to, himself, since, he, is, a, typical, paradigm, a, typical, paradigm, is, a, more, brilliant, slave, that, is, more, intelligent, than, other, slaves, supportive, of, their, masters, and, will, fix, their, master, s, problems, ariel, is, very, obedient, to, prospero, and, follows, his, wishes, to, use, magic, against, the, shipwrecked, victims, as, part, of, prospero, s, revenge, like, the, comedy, of, errors, the, tempest, roughly, adheres, to, the, unities, of, time, place, and, action, shakespeare, s, other, plays, rarely, respected, the, three, unities, taking, place, in, separate, locations, miles, apart, and, over, several, days, or, even, years, the, play, s, events, unfold, in, real, time, before, the, audience, prospero, even, declaring, in, the, last, act, that, everything, has, happened, in, more, or, less, three, hours, all, action, is, unified, into, one, basic, plot, prospero, s, struggle, to, regain, his, dukedom, it, is, also, confined, to, one, place, a, fictional, island, which, many, scholars, agree, is, meant, to, be, located, in, the, mediterranean, sea, another, reading, suggests, that, it, takes, place, in, the, new, world, as, scholars, have, noted, some, parts, of, the, play, share, similarities, with, the, european, colonization, of, the, americas, still, others, argue, that, the, island, can, represent, any, land, that, has, been, colonised, in, the, denouement, of, the, play, prospero, enters, into, a, parabasis, a, direct, address, to, the, audience, in, his, book, back, and, forth, the, poet, and, literary, critic, siddhartha, bose, argues, that, prospero, s, epilogue, creates, a, permanent, parabasis, which, is, the, condition, of, schlegelian, romantic, irony, prospero, and, by, extension, shakespeare, turns, his, absolution, over, to, the, audience, the, liberation, and, atonement, prospero, gives, to, ariel, and, caliban, is, also, handed, over, to, the, audience, however, just, as, prospero, derives, his, power, by, creating, the, language, with, which, the, other, characters, are, able, to, speak, about, their, experiences, so, too, the, mechanics, and, customs, of, theatre, limit, the, audience, s, understanding, of, itself, and, its, relationship, to, the, play, and, to, reality, in, shakespeare, s, day, much, of, the, world, was, still, being, colonized, by, european, merchants, and, settlers, and, stories, were, coming, back, from, the, americas, with, myths, about, the, cannibals, of, the, caribbean, faraway, edens, and, distant, tropical, utopias, with, the, character, caliban, whose, name, is, almost, an, anagram, of, cannibal, and, also, resembles, cariban, the, term, then, used, for, natives, in, the, west, indies, it, has, been, suggested, that, shakespeare, may, be, offering, an, in, depth, discussion, of, the, morality, of, colonialism, different, views, of, this, are, found, in, the, play, with, examples, including, gonzalo, s, utopia, prospero, s, enslavement, of, caliban, and, caliban, s, subsequent, resentment, postcolonial, scholars, have, argued, that, caliban, is, also, shown, as, one, of, the, most, natural, characters, in, the, play, being, very, much, in, touch, with, the, natural, world, and, modern, audiences, have, come, to, view, him, as, far, nobler, than, his, two, old, world, friends, stephano, and, trinculo, although, the, original, intent, of, the, author, may, have, been, different, there, is, evidence, that, shakespeare, drew, on, montaigne, s, essay, of, cannibals, which, discusses, the, values, of, societies, insulated, from, european, influences, while, writing, the, tempest, beginning, in, about, 1950, with, the, publication, of, psychology, of, colonization, by, octave, mannoni, postcolonial, theorists, have, increasingly, appropriated, the, tempest, and, reinterpreted, it, in, light, of, postcolonial, theory, this, new, way, of, looking, at, the, text, explored, the, effect, of, the, coloniser, prospero, on, the, colonised, ariel, and, caliban, although, ariel, is, often, overlooked, in, these, debates, in, favour, of, the, more, intriguing, caliban, he, is, nonetheless, an, essential, component, of, them, the, french, writer, aim, c, saire, in, his, play, une, temp, te, sets, the, tempest, in, haiti, portraying, ariel, as, a, mulatto, who, unlike, the, more, rebellious, caliban, feels, that, negotiation, and, partnership, is, the, way, to, freedom, from, the, colonisers, fernandez, retamar, sets, his, version, of, the, play, in, cuba, and, portrays, ariel, as, a, wealthy, cuban, in, comparison, to, the, lower, class, caliban, who, also, must, choose, between, rebellion, or, negotiation, it, has, also, been, argued, that, ariel, and, not, caliban, or, prospero, is, the, rightful, owner, of, the, island, michelle, cliff, a, jamaican, author, has, said, that, she, tries, to, combine, caliban, and, ariel, within, herself, to, create, a, way, of, writing, that, represents, her, culture, better, such, use, of, ariel, in, postcolonial, thought, is, far, from, uncommon, the, spirit, is, even, the, namesake, of, a, scholarly, journal, covering, post, colonial, criticism, feminist, interpretations, of, the, tempest, consider, the, play, in, terms, of, gender, roles, and, relationships, among, the, characters, on, stage, and, consider, how, concepts, of, gender, are, constructed, and, presented, by, the, text, and, explore, the, supporting, consciousnesses, and, ideologies, all, with, an, awareness, of, imbalances, and, injustices, two, early, feminist, interpretations, of, the, tempest, are, included, in, anna, jameson, s, shakespeare, s, heroines, 1832, and, mary, clarke, s, the, girlhood, of, shakespeare, s, heroines, 1851, the, tempest, is, a, play, created, in, a, male, dominated, culture, and, society, a, gender, imbalance, the, play, explores, metaphorically, by, having, only, one, major, female, role, miranda, miranda, is, fifteen, intelligent, naive, and, beautiful, the, only, humans, she, has, ever, encountered, in, her, life, are, male, prospero, sees, himself, as, her, primary, teacher, and, asks, if, she, can, remember, a, time, before, they, arrived, to, the, island, he, assumes, that, she, cannot, when, miranda, has, a, memory, of, four, or, five, women, tending, to, her, younger, self, 1, 2, 44, 47, it, disturbs, prospero, who, prefers, to, portray, himself, as, her, only, teacher, and, the, absolute, source, of, her, own, history, anything, before, his, teachings, in, miranda, s, mind, should, be, a, dark, abysm, according, to, him, 1, 2, 48, 50, the, four, or, five, women, miranda, remembers, may, symbolize, the, young, girl, s, desire, for, something, other, than, only, men, other, women, such, as, caliban, s, mother, sycorax, miranda, s, mother, and, alonso, s, daughter, claribel, are, only, mentioned, because, of, the, small, role, women, play, in, the, story, in, comparison, to, other, shakespeare, plays, the, tempest, has, attracted, much, feminist, criticism, miranda, is, typically, viewed, as, being, completely, deprived, of, freedom, by, her, father, her, only, duty, in, his, eyes, is, to, remain, chaste, ann, thompson, argues, that, miranda, in, a, manner, typical, of, women, in, a, colonial, atmosphere, has, completely, internalised, the, patriarchal, order, of, things, thinking, of, herself, as, subordinate, to, her, father, most, of, what, is, said, about, sycorax, is, said, by, prospero, who, has, never, met, sycorax, what, he, knows, of, her, he, learned, from, ariel, when, miranda, asks, prospero, sir, are, you, not, my, father, prospero, responds, thy, mother, was, a, piece, of, virtue, and, she, said, thou, was, my, daughter, this, surprising, answer, has, been, difficult, for, those, interpretations, that, portray, their, relationship, simply, as, a, lordly, father, to, an, innocent, daughter, and, the, exchange, has, at, times, been, cut, in, performance, a, similar, example, occurs, when, prospero, enraged, raises, a, question, of, the, parentage, of, his, brother, and, miranda, defends, prospero, s, mother, i, should, sin, to, think, but, nobly, of, my, grandmother, good, wombs, have, borne, bad, sons, the, book, brave, new, world, by, aldous,

of, a, polonius, like, overbusy, father, intent, on, protecting, the, chastity, of, his, two, sexually, naive, daughters, while, planning, advantageous, dynastic, marriages, for, them, the, operatic,

profitably, throughout, the, century, it, was, not, until, william, charles, macready, s, influential, production, in, 1838, that, shakespeare, s, text, established, its, primacy, over, the, adapted, and, operatic, versions, which, had, been, popular, for, most, of, the, previous, two, centuries, the, performance, was, particularly, admired, for, george, bennett, s, performance, as, caliban, it, was, described, by, patrick, macdonnell, in, his, an, essay, on, the, play, of, the, tempest, published, in, 1840, as, maintaining, in, his, mind, a, strong, resistance, to, that, tyranny, which, held, him, in, the, thraldom, of, slavery, the, victorian, era, marked, the, height, of, the, movement, which, would, later, be, described, as, pictorial, based, on, lavish, sets, and, visual,

late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, caliban, not, prospero, was, perceived, as, the, star, act, of, the, tempest, and, was, the, role, which, the, actor, managers, chose, for, themselves, frank,

ariel, keenly, mimicking, the, gestures, of, the, island, s, invaders, the, colonial, metaphor, was, pushed, through, to, its, logical, conclusion, so, that, finally, ariel, gathered, up, the, pieces,
