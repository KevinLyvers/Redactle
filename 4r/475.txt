academic, art, academicism, or, academism, is, a, style, of, painting, and, sculpture, produced, under, the, influence, of, european, academies, of, art, this, method, extended, its, influence, throughout, the, western, world, over, several, centuries, from, its, origins, in, italy, in, the, mid, 16th, century, until, its, dissipation, in, the, early, 20th, century, it, reached, its, apogee, in, the, 19th, century, after, the, end, of, the, napoleonic, wars, in, 1815, in, this, period, the, standards, of, the, french, acad, mie, des, beaux, arts, were, very, influential, combining, elements, of, neoclassicism, and, romanticism, with, jean, auguste, dominique, ingres, a, key, figure, in, the, formation, of, the, style, in, painting, the, success, of, the, french, model, led, to, the, founding, of, countless, other, art, academies, in, several, countries, later, painters, who, tried, to, continue, the, synthesis, included, william, adolphe, bouguereau, thomas, couture, and, hans, makart, among, many, others, in, sculpture, academic, art, is, characterized, by, a, tendency, towards, monumentality, as, in, the, works, of, auguste, bartholdi, and, daniel, chester, french, the, academies, were, established, to, replace, medieval, artists, guilds, and, aimed, to, systematize, the, teaching, of, art, they, emphasized, the, emulation, of, established, masters, and, the, classical, tradition, downplaying, the, importance, of, individual, creativity, valuing, instead, collective, aesthetic, and, ethical, concepts, by, helping, raise, the, professional, status, of, artists, the, academies, distanced, them, from, artisans, and, brought, them, closer, to, intellectuals, they, also, played, a, crucial, role, in, organizing, the, art, world, controlling, cultural, ideology, taste, criticism, the, art, market, as, well, as, the, exhibition, and, dissemination, of, art, they, wielded, significant, influence, due, to, their, association, with, state, power, often, acting, as, conduits, for, the, dissemination, of, artistic, political, and, social, ideals, by, deciding, what, was, considered, official, art, as, a, result, they, faced, criticism, and, controversy, from, artists, and, others, on, the, margins, of, these, academic, circles, and, their, restrictive, and, universalist, regulations, are, sometimes, considered, a, reflection, of, absolutism, overall, academicism, has, had, a, significant, impact, on, the, development, of, art, education, and, artistic, styles, its, artists, rarely, showed, interest, in, depicting, the, everyday, or, profane, thus, academic, art, is, predominantly, idealistic, rather, than, realistic, aiming, to, create, highly, polished, works, through, the, mastery, of, color, and, form, although, smaller, works, such, as, portraits, landscapes, and, still, lifes, were, also, produced, the, movement, and, the, contemporary, public, and, critics, most, valued, large, history, paintings, showing, moments, from, narratives, that, were, very, often, taken, from, ancient, or, exotic, areas, of, history, and, mythology, though, less, often, the, traditional, religious, narratives, orientalist, art, was, a, major, branch, with, many, specialist, painters, as, were, scenes, from, classical, antiquity, and, the, middle, ages, academic, art, is, also, closely, related, to, beaux, arts, architecture, as, well, as, classical, music, and, dance, which, developed, simultaneously, and, hold, to, a, similar, classicizing, ideal, although, production, of, academic, art, continued, into, the, 20th, century, the, style, had, become, vacuous, and, was, strongly, rejected, by, the, artists, of, set, of, new, art, movements, of, which, realism, and, impressionism, were, some, of, the, first, in, this, context, the, style, is, often, called, eclecticism, art, pompier, pejoratively, and, sometimes, linked, with, historicism, and, syncretism, by, world, war, i, it, had, fallen, from, favor, almost, completely, with, critics, and, buyers, before, regaining, some, appreciation, since, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, the, first, academy, of, art, was, founded, in, florence, by, cosimo, i, de, medici, on, 13, january, 1563, under, the, influence, of, the, architect, giorgio, vasari, who, called, it, the, accademia, e, compagnia, delle, arti, del, disegno, academy, and, company, for, the, arts, of, drawing, as, it, was, divided, in, two, different, operative, branches, while, the, company, was, a, kind, of, corporation, that, every, working, artist, in, tuscany, could, join, the, academy, comprised, only, the, most, eminent, artists, of, cosimo, s, court, and, had, the, task, of, overseeing, all, florentine, artistic, activities, including, teaching, and, safeguarding, local, cultural, traditions, among, the, founding, members, were, michelangelo, bartolomeo, ammannati, agnolo, bronzino, and, francesco, da, sangallo, in, this, institution, students, learned, the, arti, del, disegno, a, term, coined, by, vasari, and, heard, lectures, on, anatomy, and, geometry, the, accademia, s, fame, spread, quickly, to, the, point, that, within, just, five, months, of, its, founding, important, venetian, artists, such, as, titian, salviati, tintoretto, and, palladio, applied, for, admission, and, in, 1567, king, philip, ii, of, spain, consulted, it, about, plans, for, el, escorial, another, academy, the, accademia, de, i, pittori, e, scultori, di, roma, academy, of, painters, and, sculptors, of, rome, better, known, as, the, accademia, di, san, luca, named, after, the, patron, saint, of, painters, st, luke, was, founded, about, a, decade, later, in, rome, it, served, an, educational, function, and, was, more, concerned, with, art, theory, than, the, florentine, one, attaching, great, importance, to, attending, theoretical, lectures, debates, and, drawing, classes, twelve, academics, were, immediately, appointed, as, teachers, establishing, a, series, of, disciplinary, measures, for, studies, and, instituting, a, system, of, awards, for, the, most, capable, students, in, 1582, the, painter, and, art, instructor, annibale, carracci, opened, his, very, influential, accademia, dei, desiderosi, academy, of, the, desirous, in, bologna, without, official, support, in, some, ways, this, was, more, like, a, traditional, artist, s, studio, but, that, he, felt, the, need, to, label, it, as, an, academy, demonstrates, the, attraction, of, the, idea, at, the, time, the, emergence, of, art, academies, in, the, 16th, century, was, due, to, the, need, to, respond, to, new, social, demands, several, states, which, were, moving, towards, absolutism, realized, that, it, was, necessary, to, create, an, art, that, specifically, identified, them, and, served, as, a, symbol, of, civic, unity, and, was, also, capable, of, symbolically, consolidating, the, status, of, their, rulers, in, this, process, the, catholic, church, then, the, greatest, political, force, and, social, unifier, in, europe, began, to, lose, some, of, its, influence, as, a, result, of, the, greater, secularization, of, societies, sacred, art, by, far, the, largest, field, of, artistic, expression, throughout, the, middle, ages, came, to, coexist, with, an, expanding, profane, art, derived, from, classical, sources, which, had, been, experiencing, a, slow, revival, since, the, 12th, century, and, which, by, the, time, of, the, renaissance, had, been, established, as, the, most, prestigious, cultural, reference, and, model, of, quality, this, re, emergence, of, classicism, required, artists, to, become, more, cultured, in, order, to, competently, transpose, this, reference, to, the, visual, arts, at, the, same, time, the, old, system, of, artistic, production, organized, by, guilds, class, associations, of, an, artisanal, nature, linked, more, to, mechanical, crafts, than, to, intellectual, erudition, began, to, be, seen, as, outdated, and, socially, unworthy, as, artists, began, to, desire, equality, with, the, intellectual, versed, in, the, liberal, arts, since, art, itself, began, to, be, seen, not, only, as, a, technical, task, as, it, had, been, for, centuries, but, mainly, as, a, way, of, acquiring, and, transmitting, knowledge, in, this, new, context, painting, and, sculpture, began, to, be, seen, as, theorizable, just, as, other, arts, such, as, literature, and, especially, poetry, were, already, however, if, on, the, one, hand, the, artists, did, rise, socially, on, the, other, they, lost, the, security, of, market, insertion, that, the, guild, system, provided, having, to, live, in, the, uncertain, expectation, of, individual, protection, by, some, patron, if, italy, was, to, be, credited, with, founding, this, new, type, of, institution, france, was, responsible, for, taking, the, model, to, a, first, stage, of, great, order, and, stability, the, country, s, first, attempts, to, establish, academies, like, the, italian, ones, also, took, place, in, the, 16th, century, during, the, reign, of, king, henry, iii, especially, through, the, work, of, the, poet, jean, antoine, de, ba, f, who, founded, an, academy, linked, to, the, french, crown, like, its, italian, counterparts, it, was, primarily, philological, philosophical, in, nature, but, it, also, worked, on, concepts, relating, to, the, arts, and, sciences, although, it, developed, intense, activity, with, regular, debates, and, theoretical, production, defending, classical, principles, it, lacked, an, educational, structure, and, had, a, brief, existence, the, accademia, di, san, luca, later, served, as, the, model, for, the, french, acad, mie, royale, de, peinture, et, de, sculpture, royal, academy, of, painting, and, sculpture, founded, in, 1648, by, a, group, of, artists, led, by, charles, le, brun, and, which, later, became, the, acad, mie, des, beaux, arts, academy, of, fine, arts, its, objective, was, similar, to, the, italian, one, to, honor, artists, who, were, gentlemen, practicing, a, liberal, art, from, craftsmen, who, were, engaged, in, manual, labor, this, emphasis, on, the, intellectual, component, of, artmaking, had, a, considerable, impact, on, the, subjects, and, styles, of, academic, art, after, an, ineffective, start, the, acad, mie, royale, was, reorganized, in, 1661, by, king, louis, xiv, whose, aim, was, to, control, all, the, country, s, artistic, activity, and, in, 1671, it, came, under, the, control, of, first, minister, of, state, jean, baptiste, colbert, who, confirmed, le, brun, as, director, together, they, made, it, the, main, executive, arm, of, a, program, to, glorify, the, king, s, absolutist, monarchy, definitively, establishing, the, school, s, association, with, the, state, and, thereby, vesting, it, with, enormous, directive, power, over, the, entire, national, art, system, which, contributed, to, making, france, the, new, european, cultural, center, displacing, the, hitherto, italian, supremacy, but, while, for, the, italian, renaissance, art, was, also, a, survey, of, the, natural, world, for, le, brun, it, was, above, all, the, product, of, an, acquired, culture, inherited, forms, and, an, established, tradition, during, this, period, academic, doctrine, reached, the, peak, of, its, rigor, comprehensiveness, uniformity, formalism, and, explicitness, and, according, to, art, historian, moshe, barasch, at, no, other, time, in, the, history, of, art, theory, has, the, idea, of, perfection, been, more, intensely, cultivated, as, the, artist, s, highest, goal, with, the, production, of, the, italian, high, renaissance, as, the, ultimate, model, thus, italy, continued, to, be, an, invaluable, reference, so, much, so, that, a, branch, was, established, in, rome, in, 1666, the, french, academy, with, charles, errard, as, its, first, director, at, the, same, time, a, controversy, occurred, among, the, members, of, the, acad, mie, which, would, come, to, dominate, artistic, attitudes, for, the, rest, of, the, century, this, battle, of, styles, was, a, conflict, over, whether, peter, paul, rubens, or, nicolas, poussin, was, a, suitable, model, to, follow, followers, of, poussin, called, poussinistes, argued, that, line, disegno, should, dominate, art, because, of, its, appeal, to, the, intellect, while, followers, of, rubens, called, rubenistes, argued, that, color, colore, should, be, the, dominant, feature, because, of, its, appeal, to, emotion, the, debate, was, revived, in, the, early, 19th, century, under, the, movements, of, neoclassicism, typified, by, the, art, of, jean, auguste, dominique, ingres, and, romanticism, typified, by, the, artwork, of, eug, ne, delacroix, debates, also, occurred, over, whether, it, was, better, to, learn, art, by, looking, at, nature, or, at, the, artistic, masters, of, the, past, at, the, end, of, louis, xiv, s, reign, the, academic, style, and, teachings, strongly, associated, with, his, monarchy, began, to, spread, throughout, europe, accompanying, the, growth, of, the, urban, nobility, a, series, of, other, important, academies, were, formed, across, the, continent, inspired, by, the, success, of, the, french, acad, mie, the, akademie, der, bildenden, k, nste, in, nuremberg, 1662, the, akademie, der, k, nste, in, berlin, 1696, the, akademie, der, bildenden, k, nste, in, vienna, 1698, the, royal, drawing, academy, in, stockholm, 1735, the, real, academia, de, bellas, artes, de, san, fernando, in, madrid, 1752, the, imperial, academy, of, arts, in, saint, petersburg, 1757, and, the, accademia, di, belle, arti, di, brera, in, milan, 1776, to, name, a, few, in, england, this, was, the, royal, academy, of, arts, which, was, founded, in, 1768, with, a, mission, to, establish, a, school, or, academy, of, design, for, the, use, of, students, in, the, arts, the, royal, danish, academy, of, fine, arts, in, copenhagen, founded, in, 1754, may, be, taken, as, a, successful, example, in, a, smaller, country, which, achieved, its, aim, of, producing, a, national, school, and, reducing, the, reliance, on, imported, artists, the, painters, of, the, danish, golden, age, of, roughly, 1800, 1850, were, nearly, all, trained, there, and, drawing, on, italian, and, dutch, golden, age, paintings, as, examples, many, returned, to, teach, locally, the, history, of, danish, art, is, much, less, marked, by, tension, between, academic, art, and, other, styles, than, is, the, case, in, other, countries, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, the, model, expanded, to, america, with, the, academy, of, san, carlos, in, mexico, being, founded, in, 1783, the, pennsylvania, academy, of, fine, arts, in, the, united, states, in, 1805, and, the, imperial, academy, of, fine, arts, in, brazil, in, 1826, meanwhile, back, in, italy, another, major, center, of, irradiation, appeared, venice, launching, the, tradition, of, urban, views, and, capriccios, fantasy, landscape, scenes, populated, by, ancient, ruins, which, became, favorites, of, noble, travelers, on, the, grand, tour, even, with, its, wide, spread, the, academic, system, began, to, be, seriously, challenged, through, the, actions, of, intellectuals, linked, to, the, enlightenment, for, them, academicism, had, become, an, outdated, model, excessively, rigid, and, dogmatic, they, criticized, the, methodology, which, they, believed, produced, an, art, that, was, merely, servile, to, ancient, examples, and, condemned, the, institutional, administration, which, they, considered, corrupt, and, despotic, however, an, important, enlightenment, figure, like, diderot, subscribed, to, much, of, the, academic, ideal, supported, the, hierarchy, of, genres, see, below, and, said, that, the, imagination, creates, nothing, at, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, following, the, turmoil, of, the, french, revolution, a, real, campaign, was, mounted, against, the, teaching, of, the, academy, which, was, identified, as, a, symbol, of, the, ancien, r, gime, in, 1793, the, painter, jacques, louis, david, closely, linked, to, the, revolutionaries, took, over, the, direction, of, the, artistic, affairs, of, the, new, republic, and, after, complying, with, the, request, of, numerous, artists, dissatisfied, with, the, institution, s, bureaucracy, and, system, of, privileges, dissolved, the, parisian, academies, and, all, the, other, royal, academies, in, the, countryside, however, the, extinction, of, the, old, schools, was, temporary, as, a, committee, for, the, arts, was, subsequently, organized, which, led, to, the, founding, in, 1795, of, a, new, institution, the, institut, de, france, which, included, an, artistic, section, and, was, responsible, for, reorganizing, the, national, arts, system, the, challenges, to, academicism, in, france, however, were, more, nominal, than, real, art, courses, returned, to, operating, in, broadly, the, same, way, as, before, the, hierarchy, of, genres, was, resurrected, the, awards, and, salons, were, maintained, the, branch, in, rome, remained, active, and, the, state, continued, to, be, the, biggest, sponsor, of, art, quatrem, re, de, quincy, the, secretary, of, the, new, institut, which, had, been, born, as, an, apparatus, of, revolutionary, renewal, paradoxically, believed, that, art, schools, served, to, preserve, traditions, not, to, found, new, ones, the, greatest, innovations, he, introduced, were, the, idea, of, reunifying, the, arts, under, an, atmosphere, of, egalitarianism, eliminating, honorary, titles, for, members, and, some, other, privileges, and, his, attempt, to, make, administration, more, transparent, eminently, public, and, functional, in, reinterpreting, the, platonic, theory, that, the, arts, are, questionable, because, they, are, imperfect, imitations, of, an, abstract, ideal, reality, he, considered, this, idea, only, in, a, moral, sphere, politicized, and, republicanized, it, relating, the, truth, of, the, arts, to, that, of, social, institutions, he, also, claimed, that, the, political, reality, of, the, republic, was, a, reflection, of, the, republic, of, the, arts, that, he, sought, to, establish, but, beyond, the, ideas, in, practice, authoritarianism, which, was, one, of, the, reasons, given, for, the, extinction, of, the, royal, academies, continued, to, be, practiced, in, the, republican, administration, another, attack, on, the, academic, model, came, from, the, early, romantics, at, the, turn, of, 18th, to, 19th, centuries, who, preached, a, practice, centered, on, individual, originality, and, independence, around, 1816, the, painter, th, odore, g, ricault, one, of, the, exponents, of, french, romanticism, stated, these, schools, keep, their, pupils, in, a, state, of, constant, emulation, i, note, with, sadness, that, since, the, establishment, of, these, schools, there, has, been, a, great, effect, they, have, given, service, to, thousands, of, mediocre, talents, painters, enter, there, too, young, and, therefore, the, traces, of, individuality, that, survive, the, academy, are, imperceptible, one, can, see, with, real, chagrin, about, ten, or, twelve, compositions, every, year, that, are, practically, identical, in, execution, because, in, their, quest, for, perfection, they, lose, their, originality, one, way, of, drawing, one, type, of, color, one, arrangement, for, all, systems, since, the, onset, of, the, poussiniste, rubeniste, debate, many, artists, worked, between, the, two, styles, in, the, 19th, century, in, the, revived, form, of, the, debate, the, attention, and, the, aims, of, the, art, world, became, to, synthesize, the, line, of, neoclassicism, with, the, color, of, romanticism, one, artist, after, another, was, claimed, by, critics, to, have, achieved, the, synthesis, among, them, th, odore, chass, riau, ary, scheffer, francesco, hayez, alexandre, gabriel, decamps, and, thomas, couture, william, adolphe, bouguereau, a, later, academic, artist, commented, that, the, trick, to, being, a, good, painter, is, seeing, color, and, line, as, the, same, thing, thomas, couture, promoted, the, same, idea, in, a, book, he, authored, on, art, method, arguing, that, whenever, one, said, a, painting, had, better, color, or, better, line, it, was, nonsense, because, whenever, color, appeared, brilliant, it, depended, on, line, to, convey, it, and, vice, versa, and, that, color, was, really, a, way, to, talk, about, the, value, of, form, another, development, during, this, period, called, historicism, included, adopting, historic, styles, or, imitating, the, work, of, historic, artists, and, artisans, in, order, to, show, the, era, in, history, that, the, painting, depicted, in, the, history, of, art, after, neoclassicism, which, in, the, romantic, era, could, itself, be, considered, a, historicist, movement, the, 19th, century, included, a, new, historicist, phase, characterized, by, an, interpretation, not, only, of, greek, and, roman, classicism, but, also, of, succeeding, stylistic, eras, which, were, increasingly, respected, this, is, best, seen, in, the, work, of, baron, jan, august, hendrik, leys, a, later, influence, on, james, tissot, it, is, also, seen, in, the, development, of, the, neo, grec, style, historicism, is, also, meant, to, refer, to, the, belief, and, practice, associated, with, academic, art, that, one, should, incorporate, and, conciliate, the, innovations, of, different, traditions, of, art, from, the, past, the, art, world, also, grew, to, give, increasing, focus, on, allegory, in, art, theories, of, the, importance, of, both, line, and, color, asserted, that, through, these, elements, an, artist, exerts, control, over, the, medium, to, create, psychological, effects, in, which, themes, emotions, and, ideas, can, be, represented, as, artists, attempted, to, synthesize, these, theories, in, practice, the, attention, on, the, artwork, as, an, allegorical, or, figurative, vehicle, was, emphasized, it, was, held, that, the, representations, in, painting, and, sculpture, should, evoke, platonic, forms, or, ideals, where, behind, ordinary, depictions, one, would, glimpse, something, abstract, some, eternal, truth, hence, keats, famous, musing, beauty, is, truth, truth, beauty, the, paintings, were, desired, to, be, an, id, e, a, full, and, complete, idea, bouguereau, is, known, to, have, said, that, he, would, not, paint, a, war, but, would, paint, war, many, paintings, by, academic, artists, are, simple, nature, allegories, with, titles, like, dawn, dusk, seeing, and, tasting, where, these, ideas, are, personified, by, a, single, nude, figure, composed, in, such, a, way, as, to, bring, out, the, essence, of, the, idea, stylistically, academic, art, cultivated, the, ideal, of, perfection, and, at, the, same, time, selective, imitation, of, reality, mimesis, which, had, existed, since, aristotle, with, perfect, mastery, of, color, light, and, shadow, forms, were, created, in, a, quasi, photorealistic, manner, some, paintings, have, a, polished, finish, where, no, brushstroke, can, be, recognized, on, the, finished, work, after, the, oil, sketch, the, artist, would, produce, the, final, painting, with, the, academic, fini, changing, the, painting, to, meet, stylistic, standards, and, attempting, to, idealize, the, images, and, add, perfect, detail, similarly, perspective, was, constructed, geometrically, on, a, flat, surface, and, was, not, really, the, product, of, sight, the, trend, in, art, was, also, towards, greater, idealism, which, is, contrary, to, realism, in, that, the, figures, depicted, were, made, simpler, and, more, abstract, idealized, in, order, to, be, able, to, represent, the, ideals, they, stood, in, for, this, would, involve, both, generalizing, forms, seen, in, nature, and, subordinating, them, to, the, unity, and, theme, of, the, artwork, the, representation, of, the, various, emotions, was, codified, in, detail, by, academicism, and, the, artistic, genres, themselves, were, subjected, to, a, scale, of, prestige, because, history, and, mythology, were, considered, plays, or, dialectics, of, ideas, a, fertile, ground, for, important, allegory, using, themes, from, these, subjects, was, regarded, as, the, most, serious, form, of, painting, this, hierarchy, of, genres, originally, created, in, the, 17th, century, was, highly, valued, where, history, painting, also, known, as, the, grande, genre, classical, religious, mythological, literary, and, allegorical, subjects, was, placed, at, the, top, followed, by, minor, genres, portraiture, genre, painting, landscapes, and, still, lifes, the, historical, genre, the, most, appreciated, included, works, that, conveyed, themes, of, an, inspirational, and, ennobling, nature, essentially, with, an, ethical, background, consistent, with, the, tradition, founded, by, masters, such, as, michelangelo, raphael, and, leonardo, da, vinci, paul, delaroche, is, a, typifying, example, of, french, history, painting, and, benjamin, west, of, the, british, american, vogue, for, painting, scenes, from, recent, history, paintings, by, hans, makart, are, often, larger, than, life, historical, dramas, and, he, combined, this, with, a, historicism, in, decoration, to, dominate, the, style, of, 19th, century, vienna, culture, portraits, included, large, format, depictions, of, people, suitable, for, their, public, glorification, but, also, smaller, pieces, for, private, use, everyday, scenes, also, known, as, genre, scenes, portrayed, common, life, in, a, symbolic, manner, landscapes, offered, perspectives, of, idealized, virgin, nature, or, city, panoramas, and, still, lifes, consisted, of, groupings, of, diverse, objects, in, formal, compositions, the, justification, for, this, hierarchization, lay, in, the, idea, that, each, genre, had, an, inherent, and, specific, moral, force, thus, an, artist, could, convey, a, moral, principle, with, much, more, power, and, ease, through, a, historical, scene, than, for, example, through, a, still, life, furthermore, following, greek, concepts, it, was, believed, that, the, highest, form, of, art, was, the, ideal, representation, of, the, human, body, hence, landscapes, and, still, lifes, in, which, man, did, not, appear, had, little, prestige, finally, with, a, primarily, social, and, didactic, function, academic, art, favored, large, works, and, large, format, portraits, more, suitable, for, viewing, by, large, groups, of, spectators, and, better, suited, to, decorating, public, spaces, all, of, these, trends, were, influenced, by, the, theories, of, the, german, philosopher, hegel, who, held, that, history, was, a, dialectic, of, competing, ideas, which, eventually, resolved, in, synthesis, napoleon, was, the, swan, song, of, the, concept, of, art, as, a, vehicle, of, moral, values, and, a, mirror, of, virtue, he, actively, patronized, and, employed, artists, to, portray, his, personal, glory, that, of, his, empire, and, of, his, political, and, military, conquests, after, him, the, fragmentation, and, weakening, of, ideals, began, to, become, visible, and, irreversible, with, the, cooling, of, the, libertarian, ardor, of, the, first, romantics, with, the, final, failure, of, napoleon, s, imperialist, project, and, with, the, popularization, of, an, eclectic, style, that, blended, romanticism, and, neoclassicism, adapting, them, to, the, purposes, of, the, bourgeoisie, which, became, one, of, the, greatest, sponsors, of, the, arts, the, emergence, of, a, general, feeling, of, resignation, appeared, as, well, as, a, growing, prevalence, of, individual, bourgeois, taste, against, idealistic, collective, systems, soon, the, preferences, of, this, social, class, now, so, influential, penetrated, higher, education, and, became, worthy, objects, of, representation, changing, the, hierarchy, of, genres, and, proliferating, portraits, and, all, the, so, called, minor, genres, such, as, everyday, scenes, and, still, lifes, which, became, more, pronounced, as, the, century, progressed, the, bourgeoisie, s, support, for, academies, was, a, way, of, demonstrating, education, and, acquiring, social, prestige, bringing, them, closer, to, the, cultural, and, political, elites, finally, neo, gothic, revivalism, the, development, of, a, taste, for, the, picturesque, as, an, autonomous, aesthetic, criterion, the, revival, of, hellenistic, eclecticism, the, progress, of, medievalist, orientalist, and, folkloric, studies, the, growing, participation, of, women, in, art, production, the, valorisation, of, handicrafts, and, applied, arts, opened, up, other, fronts, of, appreciation, for, the, visual, arts, finding, other, truths, worthy, of, appreciation, that, had, previously, been, neglected, and, relegated, to, the, margins, of, official, culture, as, a, result, of, this, great, cultural, transformation, the, academic, educational, model, in, order, to, survive, had, to, incorporate, some, of, these, innovations, but, it, broadly, maintained, the, established, tradition, and, managed, to, become, even, more, influential, continuing, to, inspire, not, only, europe, but, also, america, and, other, countries, colonized, by, europeans, throughout, the, 19th, century, another, factor, in, this, academic, revival, even, in, the, face, of, a, profoundly, changing, scenario, was, the, reiteration, of, the, idea, of, art, as, an, instrument, of, political, affirmation, by, nationalist, movements, in, several, countries, the, 19th, century, was, the, heyday, of, the, academies, in, the, sense, that, their, output, became, extremely, well, accepted, among, a, much, wider, but, often, less, cultured, and, less, demanding, public, giving, academic, art, a, popularity, as, great, as, that, enjoyed, today, by, cinema, and, with, an, equally, popular, theme, covering, everything, from, traditional, historical, subjects, to, comic, vignettes, from, sweet, and, sentimental, portraits, to, medievalist, or, picturesque, scenes, from, exotic, eastern, countries, something, unthinkable, during, the, ancien, r, gime, by, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, academic, art, had, saturated, european, society, exhibitions, were, held, often, with, the, most, popular, exhibition, being, the, paris, salon, and, beginning, in, 1903, the, salon, d, automne, these, salons, were, large, scale, events, that, attracted, crowds, of, visitors, both, native, and, foreign, as, much, a, social, affair, as, an, artistic, one, 50, 000, people, might, visit, on, a, single, sunday, and, as, many, as, 500, 000, could, see, the, exhibition, during, its, two, month, run, thousands, of, paintings, were, displayed, hung, from, just, below, eye, level, all, the, way, up, to, the, ceiling, in, a, manner, now, known, as, salon, style, a, successful, showing, at, the, salon, was, a, seal, of, approval, for, an, artist, making, his, work, saleable, to, the, growing, ranks, of, private, collectors, bouguereau, alexandre, cabanel, and, jean, l, on, g, r, me, were, leading, figures, of, this, art, world, during, the, reign, of, academic, art, the, paintings, of, the, rococo, era, previously, held, in, low, favor, were, revived, to, popularity, and, themes, often, used, in, rococo, art, such, as, eros, and, psyche, were, popular, again, the, academic, art, world, also, admired, raphael, for, the, idealism, of, his, work, in, fact, preferring, him, over, michelangelo, in, england, the, influence, of, the, royal, academy, grew, as, its, association, with, the, state, consolidated, in, the, first, half, of, the, 19th, century, the, royal, academy, already, exercised, direct, or, indirect, control, over, a, vast, network, of, galleries, museums, exhibitions, and, other, artistic, societies, and, over, a, complex, of, administrative, agencies, that, included, the, crown, parliament, and, other, state, departments, which, found, their, cultural, expression, through, their, relations, with, the, academic, institution, the, royal, academy, summer, exhibition, gained, momentum, at, the, time, and, has, been, staged, annually, without, interruption, to, the, present, day, as, the, century, progressed, challenges, to, this, primacy, began, to, emerge, demanding, that, its, relations, with, the, government, be, clarified, and, the, institution, began, to, pay, more, attention, to, market, aspects, in, a, society, that, was, becoming, more, heterogeneous, and, cultivating, multiple, aesthetic, tendencies, subsidiary, schools, were, also, opened, in, various, cities, to, meet, regional, demands, by, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, the, royal, academy, had, already, lost, control, over, british, artistic, production, faced, with, the, multiplication, of, independent, creators, and, associations, but, continued, facing, internal, tensions, to, try, to, preserve, it, around, 1860, it, was, again, stabilized, through, new, strategies, of, monopolizing, power, incorporating, new, trends, into, its, orbit, such, as, promoting, the, previously, ignored, technique, of, watercolor, which, had, become, vastly, popular, accepting, the, admission, of, women, requiring, new, members, in, an, enlarged, membership, to, renounce, their, affiliation, to, other, societies, and, reforming, its, administrative, structure, to, appear, as, a, private, institution, but, imbued, with, a, civic, purpose, and, a, public, character, in, this, way, it, managed, to, administer, a, significant, part, of, the, british, artistic, universe, throughout, the, 19th, century, and, despite, the, opposition, of, societies, and, groups, of, artists, such, as, the, pre, raphaelites, it, managed, to, remain, a, disciplinary, educational, and, consecrating, agency, of, the, greatest, importance, able, to, largely, accompany, the, progress, of, modernism, contradicting, a, common, view, that, academies, are, invariably, reactionary, in, germany, the, academic, spirit, initially, encountered, some, resistance, to, its, full, implementation, already, at, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, theorists, such, as, baumgarten, schiller, and, kant, had, promoted, the, autonomy, of, aesthetics, through, the, concept, of, art, for, art, s, sake, and, had, emphasized, the, importance, of, the, artist, s, self, education, against, the, massification, imposed, by, civilization, and, its, institutions, seeing, the, collectivizing, structure, and, impersonal, nature, of, academia, as, a, threat, to, their, desires, for, creative, freedom, individualistic, inspiration, and, absolute, originality, in, this, vein, art, criticism, began, to, take, on, distinctly, sociological, colors, part, of, this, reaction, was, due, to, the, activity, of, the, nazarenes, a, group, of, painters, who, sought, a, return, to, a, renaissance, style, and, medieval, practices, in, a, spirit, of, austerity, and, fraternity, under, their, influence, masterclasses, were, introduced, paradoxically, within, the, academies, themselves, which, sought, to, group, promising, students, around, a, master, who, was, responsible, for, their, instruction, but, with, much, more, concentrated, attention, and, care, than, in, the, more, generalist, french, system, based, on, the, assumption, that, such, more, individualized, treatment, could, provide, a, stronger, and, deeper, education, this, method, was, first, instituted, at, the, dusseldorf, academy, and, progressed, slowly, but, over, the, course, of, the, 19th, century, it, became, common, to, all, german, academies, and, was, also, imitated, in, other, northern, european, countries, interesting, results, of, the, masterclasses, were, the, beginning, of, a, tradition, of, large, scale, mural, painting, and, the, steering, of, the, local, avant, garde, along, less, iconoclastic, lines, than, the, parisian, ones, the, influence, of, the, royal, academy, extended, across, the, ocean, and, strongly, determined, the, foundation, and, direction, of, american, art, from, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, until, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, when, the, country, began, to, establish, its, cultural, independence, some, of, the, leading, local, artists, studied, in, london, under, the, guidance, of, the, royal, academy, and, others, who, settled, in, england, continued, to, exert, influence, in, their, home, country, through, regular, submissions, of, works, of, art, this, was, the, case, with, john, singleton, copley, the, dominant, influence, in, his, country, until, the, beginning, of, the, 19th, century, and, also, with, benjamin, west, who, became, one, of, the, leaders, of, the, english, neoclassical, romantic, movement, and, one, of, the, main, european, names, of, his, generation, in, the, field, of, history, painting, he, made, a, number, of, fellow, disciples, such, as, charles, willson, peale, gilbert, stuart, and, john, trumbull, and, his, influence, was, similar, to, that, of, copley, on, american, painting, the, first, academy, to, be, created, in, the, united, states, was, the, pennsylvania, academy, of, the, fine, arts, founded, in, 1805, and, still, active, today, the, initiative, came, from, the, painter, charles, peale, and, the, sculptor, william, rush, along, with, other, artists, and, traders, its, progress, was, slow, and, its, peak, was, only, reached, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, when, it, began, to, receive, significant, financial, support, opened, a, gallery, and, formed, its, own, collection, becoming, an, anti, modernist, bastion, the, most, decisive, step, toward, the, formation, of, an, american, academic, culture, was, taken, when, the, national, academy, of, design, was, founded, in, 1826, by, samuel, f, b, morse, asher, b, durand, thomas, cole, and, other, artists, dissatisfied, with, the, orientation, of, the, pennsylvania, academy, it, soon, became, the, most, respected, artistic, institution, in, the, country, its, method, followed, the, traditional, academic, model, focusing, on, drawing, from, classical, and, live, models, in, addition, to, offering, lectures, on, anatomy, perspective, history, and, mythology, among, other, subjects, cole, and, durand, were, also, the, founders, of, the, hudson, river, school, an, aesthetic, movement, that, began, a, great, painting, tradition, lasting, for, three, generations, with, a, remarkable, unity, of, principles, and, which, presented, the, national, landscape, in, an, epic, idealistic, and, sometimes, fanciful, light, its, members, included, albert, bierstadt, and, frederic, edwin, church, the, most, celebrated, landscape, painters, of, their, generation, in, the, field, of, sculpture, however, the, greatest, influence, came, from, the, italian, academies, especially, through, the, example, of, antonio, canova, who, was, the, main, figure, of, european, neoclassicism, educated, in, part, at, the, venice, academy, and, in, rome, italy, offered, a, historical, and, cultural, backdrop, of, irresistible, interest, to, sculptors, with, priceless, monuments, ruins, and, collections, and, working, conditions, were, infinitely, superior, to, those, of, the, new, world, where, there, was, a, shortage, of, both, marble, and, capable, assistants, to, help, the, artist, in, the, complex, and, laborious, art, of, stone, carving, and, bronze, casting, horatio, greenough, was, just, the, first, in, a, large, wave, of, americans, to, settle, between, rome, and, florence, the, most, notable, of, these, was, william, wetmore, story, who, after, 1857, assumed, leadership, of, the, american, colony, that, had, been, created, in, rome, becoming, a, reference, for, all, newcomers, despite, their, stay, in, italy, the, group, continued, to, be, celebrated, in, their, country, and, their, artistic, achievements, received, continuous, press, coverage, until, the, neoclassical, vogue, dissipated, in, north, america, from, the, 1870s, onwards, by, this, time, the, united, states, had, already, established, its, culture, and, created, the, general, conditions, to, promote, consistent, and, high, level, local, sculptural, production, adopting, an, eclectic, synthesis, of, styles, these, sculptors, also, strongly, absorbed, the, influence, of, the, french, acad, mie, several, of, them, were, educated, there, and, their, production, populated, most, public, spaces, and, the, facades, of, major, american, buildings, with, works, of, strong, civic, and, great, formalism, that, became, icons, of, local, culture, such, as, the, statue, of, abraham, lincoln, by, daniel, chester, french, and, the, memorial, to, robert, gould, shaw, by, augustus, saint, gaudens, in, 1875, the, art, students, league, took, over, as, the, leading, american, art, academy, founded, by, students, inspired, by, the, model, of, the, french, acad, mie, establishing, the, guidelines, for, national, art, education, until, world, war, ii, while, also, opening, its, classes, to, women, offering, better, working, conditions, than, its, parisian, model, the, league, was, created, by, artists, who, saw, in, the, french, academic, environment, an, appeal, to, culture, and, civilization, and, believed, that, this, model, would, discipline, the, national, democratic, impulse, transcending, regionalisms, and, social, differences, refine, the, taste, of, capitalists, and, contribute, to, elevating, society, and, improving, its, culture, academic, art, not, only, held, influence, in, western, europe, and, the, united, states, but, also, extended, its, influence, to, other, countries, the, artistic, environment, of, greece, for, instance, was, dominated, by, techniques, from, western, academies, from, the, 17th, century, onward, this, was, first, evident, in, the, activities, of, the, ionian, school, and, later, became, especially, pronounced, with, the, dawn, of, the, munich, school, this, was, also, true, for, latin, american, nations, which, because, their, revolutions, were, modeled, on, the, french, revolution, sought, to, emulate, french, culture, an, example, of, a, latin, american, academic, artist, is, ngel, z, rraga, of, mexico, academic, art, in, poland, flourished, under, jan, matejko, who, established, the, krak, w, academy, of, fine, arts, many, of, these, works, can, be, seen, in, the, gallery, of, 19th, century, polish, art, at, sukiennice, in, krak, w, the, academies, had, as, a, basic, assumption, the, idea, that, art, could, be, taught, through, its, systematization, into, a, fully, communicable, body, of, theory, and, practice, minimizing, the, importance, of, creativity, as, an, entirely, original, and, individual, contribution, instead, they, valued, the, emulation, of, established, masters, venerating, the, classical, tradition, and, adopted, collectively, formulated, concepts, that, had, not, only, an, aesthetic, character, but, also, an, ethical, origin, and, purpose, young, artists, spent, four, years, in, rigorous, training, in, france, only, students, who, passed, an, exam, and, carried, a, letter, of, reference, from, a, noted, professor, of, art, were, accepted, at, the, academy, s, school, the, cole, des, beaux, arts, school, of, fine, arts, drawings, and, paintings, of, the, nude, called, acad, mies, were, the, basic, building, blocks, of, academic, art, and, the, procedure, for, learning, to, make, them, was, clearly, defined, first, students, copied, prints, after, classical, sculptures, becoming, familiar, with, the, principles, of, contour, light, and, shade, the, copy, was, believed, crucial, to, the, academic, education, from, copying, works, of, past, artists, one, would, assimilate, their, methods, of, artmaking, to, advance, to, the, next, step, and, every, successive, one, students, presented, drawings, for, evaluation, if, approved, they, would, then, draw, from, plaster, casts, of, famous, classical, sculptures, only, after, acquiring, these, skills, were, artists, permitted, entrance, to, classes, in, which, a, live, model, posed, painting, was, not, taught, at, the, cole, des, beaux, arts, until, after, 1863, to, learn, to, paint, with, a, brush, the, student, first, had, to, demonstrate, proficiency, in, drawing, which, was, considered, the, foundation, of, academic, painting, only, then, could, the, pupil, join, the, studio, of, an, academician, and, learn, how, to, paint, throughout, the, entire, process, competitions, with, a, predetermined, subject, and, a, specific, allotted, period, of, time, measured, each, student, s, progress, the, most, famous, art, competition, for, students, was, the, prix, de, rome, whose, winner, was, awarded, a, fellowship, to, study, at, the, acad, mie, fran, aise, s, school, at, the, villa, medici, in, rome, for, up, to, five, years, to, compete, an, artist, had, to, be, of, french, nationality, male, under, 30, years, of, age, and, single, he, had, to, have, met, the, entrance, requirements, of, the, cole, des, beaux, arts, and, have, the, support, of, a, well, known, art, teacher, the, competition, was, grueling, involving, several, stages, before, the, final, one, in, which, 10, competitors, were, sequestered, in, studios, for, 72, days, to, paint, their, final, history, paintings, the, winner, was, essentially, assured, a, successful, professional, career, as, noted, a, successful, showing, at, the, salon, the, exhibition, of, work, founded, by, the, cole, des, beaux, arts, was, a, seal, of, approval, for, an, artist, artists, petitioned, the, hanging, committee, for, optimal, placement, on, the, line, or, at, eye, level, after, the, exhibition, opened, artists, complained, if, their, works, were, skyed, or, hung, too, high, the, ultimate, achievement, for, the, professional, artist, was, election, to, membership, in, the, acad, mie, fran, aise, and, the, right, to, be, known, as, an, academician, this, depended, on, his, consistency, in, exhibitions, at, the, salons, and, the, permanence, of, his, production, at, a, level, of, excellence, one, effect, of, the, move, to, academies, was, to, make, training, more, difficult, for, women, artists, who, were, excluded, from, most, academies, until, the, last, half, of, the, 19th, century, this, was, partly, because, of, concerns, over, the, perceived, impropriety, presented, by, nudity, during, training, in, france, for, example, the, powerful, cole, des, beaux, arts, had, 450, members, between, the, 17th, century, and, the, french, revolution, of, which, only, 15, were, women, of, those, most, were, daughters, or, wives, of, members, in, the, late, 18th, century, the, french, academy, resolved, not, to, admit, any, women, at, all, as, a, result, there, are, no, extant, large, scale, history, paintings, by, women, from, this, period, though, some, women, like, marie, denise, villers, and, constance, mayer, made, their, name, in, other, genres, such, as, portraiture, in, spite, of, this, there, were, important, steps, forward, for, female, artists, in, paris, the, salon, became, open, to, non, academic, painters, in, 1791, allowing, women, to, showcase, their, work, in, the, prestigious, annual, exhibition, additionally, women, were, more, frequently, being, accepted, as, students, by, famous, artists, such, as, jacques, louis, david, and, jean, baptiste, greuze, the, emphasis, in, academic, art, on, studies, of, the, nude, remained, a, considerable, barrier, for, women, studying, art, until, the, 20th, century, both, in, terms, of, actual, access, to, the, classes, and, in, terms, of, family, and, social, attitudes, to, middle, class, women, becoming, artists, academic, art, was, first, criticized, for, its, use, of, idealism, by, realist, artists, such, as, gustave, courbet, as, being, based, on, idealistic, clich, s, and, representing, mythical, and, legendary, motives, while, contemporary, social, concerns, were, being, ignored, another, criticism, by, realists, was, the, false, surface, of, paintings, the, objects, depicted, looked, smooth, slick, and, idealized, showing, no, real, texture, the, realist, th, odule, ribot, worked, against, this, by, experimenting, with, rough, unfinished, textures, in, his, painting, stylistically, the, impressionists, who, advocated, quickly, painting, outdoors, exactly, what, the, eye, sees, and, the, hand, puts, down, criticized, the, finished, and, idealized, painting, style, although, academic, painters, began, a, painting, by, first, making, drawings, and, then, painting, oil, sketches, of, their, subject, the, high, polish, they, gave, to, their, drawings, seemed, to, the, impressionists, tantamount, to, a, lie, who, disavowed, the, devotion, to, mechanical, techniques, realists, and, impressionists, also, defied, the, placement, of, still, life, and, landscape, at, the, bottom, of, the, hierarchy, of, genres, most, realists, and, impressionists, and, others, among, the, early, avant, garde, who, rebelled, against, academism, were, originally, students, in, academic, ateliers, claude, monet, gustave, courbet, douard, manet, and, even, henri, matisse, were, students, under, academic, artists, other, artists, such, as, the, symbolist, painters, and, some, of, the, surrealists, were, kinder, to, the, tradition, as, painters, who, sought, to, bring, imaginary, vistas, to, life, these, artists, were, more, willing, to, learn, from, a, strongly, representational, tradition, once, the, tradition, had, come, to, be, looked, on, as, old, fashioned, the, allegorical, nudes, and, theatrically, posed, figures, struck, some, viewers, as, bizarre, and, dreamlike, as, modern, art, and, its, avant, garde, gained, more, power, academic, art, was, further, denigrated, and, seen, as, sentimental, clich, d, conservative, non, innovative, bourgeois, and, styleless, the, french, referred, derisively, to, the, style, of, academic, art, as, l, art, pompier, pompier, means, fireman, alluding, to, the, paintings, of, jacques, louis, david, who, was, held, in, esteem, by, the, academy, which, often, depicted, soldiers, wearing, fireman, like, helmets, it, also, suggests, half, puns, in, french, with, pomp, ien, from, pompeii, and, pompeux, pompous, the, paintings, were, called, grandes, machines, which, were, said, to, have, manufactured, false, emotion, through, contrivances, and, tricks, faced, with, the, dissatisfaction, of, a, growing, number, of, artists, excluded, from, the, official, salons, of, the, french, academy, in, 1863, emperor, napoleon, iii, established, the, salon, des, refus, s, salon, of, the, refused, which, is, considered, one, of, the, initial, milestones, of, modernism, even, with, this, concession, the, public, reaction, was, negative, and, an, anonymous, review, published, at, the, time, summarizes, the, general, attitude, this, exhibition, is, sad, and, grotesque, save, for, one, or, two, questionable, exceptions, there, is, not, a, single, work, that, deserves, the, honor, of, being, shown, in, the, official, galleries, there, is, even, something, cruel, about, this, exhibition, people, laugh, as, if, everything, was, nothing, more, than, a, farce, following, the, example, of, courbet, who, in, 1855, had, opened, a, solo, exhibition, he, called, the, pavillon, du, r, alisme, pavilion, of, realism, in, 1867, manet, rejected, from, the, official, salon, exhibited, independently, and, six, years, later, a, group, of, impressionists, founded, the, salon, des, ind, pendants, salon, of, independents, as, a, result, of, these, initiatives, the, art, market, began, to, open, up, to, alternative, schools, while, dealers, for, new, creators, and, private, societies, began, aggressive, campaigns, to, publicize, their, own, artists, opening, up, various, exhibition, spaces, to, capture, the, interest, of, the, bourgeois, consumer, public, independent, critics, and, literati, also, played, an, important, role, in, shifting, the, economic, and, social, center, of, gravity, of, the, art, system, protecting, and, promoting, various, non, academic, artists, and, providing, a, kind, of, informal, public, education, through, the, publication, of, articles, in, the, press, which, became, a, major, forum, for, artistic, debate, and, one, with, a, wide, reach, in, this, process, the, official, institution, of, the, academy, by, then, renamed, the, cole, des, beaux, arts, and, having, severed, its, connection, with, the, government, began, to, lose, ground, rapidly, beginning, its, decline, as, a, consecrating, and, educational, institution, british, art, critic, clive, bell, linked, to, the, bloomsbury, group, of, english, modernism, stated, in, 1914, that, by, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, art, had, died, losing, all, its, aesthetic, interest, and, even, tradition, had, ceased, to, exist, this, denigration, of, academic, art, reached, its, peak, through, the, writings, of, american, art, critic, clement, greenberg, who, stated, in, 1939, that, all, academic, art, is, kitsch, in, the, sense, of, banal, commercialist, and, tried, to, associate, academicism, with, the, problems, of, industrial, capitalism, in, addition, to, linking, a, new, concept, of, good, taste, with, the, ethics, of, left, wing, anti, bourgeois, political, radicalism, for, him, the, avant, garde, was, positive, because, it, was, an, affective, expression, of, a, libertarian, social, conscience, and, was, therefore, truer, and, freer, which, was, repeated, ad, infinitum, afterwards, following, the, logic, academic, reactionary, bad, versus, avant, garde, radical, good, several, other, influential, critics, such, as, herbert, read, and, ernst, gombrich, devoted, great, efforts, to, breaking, away, from, traditional, academic, standards, in, all, matters, of, teaching, not, just, in, art, teaching, great, importance, was, given, to, creativity, as, the, starting, point, for, the, learning, process, preaching, the, abandonment, of, rules, and, formalisms, and, aligning, themselves, with, the, proposals, of, educators, and, educational, philosophers, such, as, maria, montessori, and, jean, ovide, decroly, even, several, of, the, most, important, modern, artists, such, as, kandinsky, klee, malevich, and, moholy, nagy, dedicated, themselves, to, creating, schools, and, formulating, new, theories, for, art, education, based, on, these, ideas, most, notably, the, bauhaus, founded, in, weimar, germany, in, 1919, by, walter, gropius, for, modernists, creativity, was, an, innate, faculty, of, perception, and, imagination, possessed, by, all, people, and, the, less, it, was, influenced, by, theories, and, norms, the, richer, and, more, fertile, it, would, be, in, this, context, art, education, simply, aimed, to, provide, the, means, for, this, free, creativity, guided, by, feelings, and, emotions, to, be, expressed, materially, as, a, work, of, art, a, unique, and, original, form, that, had, its, own, syntax, and, did, not, depend, on, previous, references, mannerist, baroque, rococo, and, neoclassical, academic, production, managed, to, pass, relatively, unscathed, by, modernist, criticism, and, secure, its, place, in, history, but, eclectic, academic, trends, of, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, were, ridiculed, and, devalued, to, the, point, that, throughout, the, 20th, century, most, of, these, works, were, discarded, from, private, collections, saw, their, market, prices, plummet, and, were, removed, from, display, in, museums, relegated, to, oblivion, in, their, storerooms, by, the, 1950s, all, the, last, practitioners, of, the, old, academicism, had, been, cast, into, obscurity, more, than, that, pure, opposition, to, academicism, had, become, one, of, the, main, cohesive, forces, of, the, modern, movement, and, the, only, thing, that, interested, critics, linked, to, the, avant, garde, was, the, avant, garde, itself, despite, the, widespread, discredit, into, which, academicism, fell, several, researchers, throughout, the, 20th, century, undertook, the, study, of, the, academic, phenomenon, art, historian, paul, barlow, stated, that, despite, the, wide, dissemination, of, modernism, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, the, theoretical, bases, of, its, rejection, of, academicism, were, surprisingly, little, explored, by, its, proponents, forming, above, all, a, kind, of, anti, academic, myth, more, than, a, consistent, critique, of, all, those, engaged, in, this, study, nikolaus, pevsner, was, perhaps, the, most, important, describing, in, the, 1940s, the, history, of, academies, on, an, epic, scale, but, focusing, on, the, institutional, and, organizational, aspects, disconnecting, them, from, the, aesthetic, and, geographical, ones, many, authors, agree, that, the, birth, of, modernism, can, be, described, as, the, end, of, collective, values, and, the, denial, of, art, as, essentially, a, vehicle, for, moral, principles, it, is, true, that, moralizing, and, historical, works, continued, to, be, produced, throughout, the, 20th, century, but, with, a, completely, different, impact, when, in, the, victorian, period, morality, had, come, to, mean, above, all, chastity, modernism, has, also, been, described, as, responsible, for, a, process, of, pulverizing, hierarchies, and, for, the, beginning, of, the, reign, of, individualism, and, subjectivity, in, art, in, a, much, deeper, way, than, had, already, been, suggested, by, the, romantics, or, even, by, the, mannerists, much, earlier, creating, a, multiplicity, of, personal, aesthetics, that, were, not, consolidated, into, a, common, and, uniform, language, with, little, or, no, concern, for, inserting, production, into, an, organized, system, or, creating, socially, engaged, art, they, are, even, accused, of, having, practiced, their, own, version, of, the, elitist, dictatorship, that, they, condemned, in, academicism, with, the, goals, of, postmodernism, in, giving, a, fuller, more, sociological, and, pluralistic, account, of, history, academic, art, has, been, brought, back, into, history, books, and, discussion, since, the, early, 1990s, the, creation, of, academic, art, has, even, experienced, a, limited, resurgence, through, the, classical, realist, atelier, movement, in, museums, and, art, galleries, l, art, pompier, a, term, supporters, mostly, avoid, has, also, enjoyed, something, of, a, critical, revival, partly, caused, by, the, mus, e, d, orsay, in, paris, where, it, is, displayed, on, more, equal, terms, with, the, impressionists, and, realist, painters, of, the, period, the, opening, of, this, museum, in, 1986, did, not, go, without, heated, debate, in, france, as, it, was, seen, by, some, critics, as, a, rehabilitation, of, academicism, or, even, revisionism, the, art, historian, andr, chastel, however, considered, as, early, as, 1973, that, there, were, nothing, but, advantages, in, replacing, a, global, judgment, of, disapproval, the, legacy, of, old, battles, with, a, quiet, and, objective, curiosity, some, other, institutional, agents, of, this, rescue, are, the, dahesh, museum, of, art, in, the, united, states, which, specializes, in, academic, art, of, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, as, well, as, the, art, renewal, center, also, based, in, the, united, states, and, dedicated, to, promoting, academicism, as, a, basis, for, the, qualified, training, of, future, masters, additionally, the, art, is, gaining, a, broader, appreciation, by, the, public, at, large, and, whereas, academic, paintings, once, would, only, fetch, a, few, hundreds, of, dollars, in, auctions, some, now, fetch, millions
