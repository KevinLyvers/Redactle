javanese, buddhist, architecture, which, blends, the, indonesian, indigenous, tradition, of, ancestor, worship, and, the, buddhist, concept, of, attaining, nirv, a, the, monument, is, a, shrine, to, the, buddha, and, a, place, for, buddhist, pilgrimage, evidence, suggests, that, borobudur, was, constructed, in, the, 8th, century, and, subsequently, abandoned, following, the, 14th, century, decline, of, hindu, kingdoms, in, java, and, the, javanese, conversion, to, islam, worldwide, knowledge, of, its, existence, was, sparked, in, 1814, by, sir, thomas, stamford, raffles, then, the, british, ruler, of, java, who, was, advised, of, its, location, by, native, indonesians, borobudur, has, since, been, preserved, through, several, restorations, the, largest, restoration, project, was, completed, at, 1983, by, the, indonesian, government, and, unesco, followed, by, the, monument, s, listing, as, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, borobudur, is, the, largest, buddhist, temple, in, the, world, and, ranks, with, bagan, in, myanmar, and, angkor, wat, in, cambodia, as, one, of, the, great, archeological, sites, of, southeast, asia, borobudur, remains, popular, for, pilgrimage, with, buddhists, in, indonesia, celebrating, vesak, day, at, the, monument, among, indonesia, s, tourist, attractions, borobudur, is, the, most, visited, monument, in, indonesian, ancient, temples, are, referred, to, as, candi, thus, locals, refer, to, borobudur, temple, as, candi, borobudur, the, term, candi, also, loosely, describes, ancient, structures, for, example, gates, and, baths, the, origins, of, name, borobudur, is, derived, from, boro, for, big, and, budur, for, buddha, dutch, scholar, j, l, moens, says, the, court, poet, mpu, prapanca, referred, to, a, holy, sanctuary, at, budur, in, 1365, stamford, raffles, mentioned, b, ro, b, do, and, described, the, temple, in, his, 1817, book, on, javan, history, in, a, footnote, raffles, says, b, ro, is, the, name, of, the, district, and, b, do, means, ancient, most, candi, are, named, after, a, nearby, village, if, it, followed, javanese, language, conventions, and, was, named, after, the, nearby, village, of, bore, the, monument, should, have, been, named, budurboro, soekmono, says, raffles, thought, that, budur, might, correspond, to, the, modern, javanese, word, buda, ancient, i, e, ancient, boro, he, also, suggested, that, the, name, might, derive, from, boro, meaning, great, or, honorable, and, budur, for, buddha, however, another, archaeologist, suggests, the, second, component, of, the, name, budur, comes, from, javanese, term, bhudhara, mountain, another, possible, etymology, by, dutch, archaeologist, a, j, bernet, kempers, suggests, that, borobudur, is, a, corrupted, simplified, local, javanese, pronunciation, of, biara, beduhur, written, in, sanskrit, as, vihara, buddha, uhr, the, term, buddha, uhr, could, mean, the, city, of, buddhas, while, another, possible, term, beduhur, is, probably, an, old, javanese, term, still, surviving, today, in, balinese, vocabulary, which, means, a, high, place, constructed, from, the, stem, word, dhuhur, or, luhur, high, this, suggests, that, borobudur, means, vihara, of, buddha, located, on, a, high, place, or, on, a, hill, the, construction, and, inauguration, of, a, sacred, buddhist, building, possibly, a, reference, to, borobudur, was, mentioned, in, two, inscriptions, both, discovered, in, kedu, temanggung, regency, the, karangtengah, inscription, dated, 824, mentioned, a, sacred, building, named, jinalaya, the, realm, of, those, who, have, conquered, worldly, desire, and, reached, enlightenment, inaugurated, by, pramodhawardhani, daughter, of, samaratungga, the, tri, tepusan, inscription, dated, 842, is, mentioned, in, the, sima, the, tax, free, lands, awarded, by, r, kahulunnan, pramodhawardhani, to, ensure, the, funding, and, maintenance, of, a, kam, l, n, called, bh, misambh, ra, kam, l, n, is, from, the, word, mula, which, means, the, place, of, origin, a, sacred, building, to, honor, the, ancestors, probably, those, of, the, sailendras, johannes, gijsbertus, de, casparis, suggested, that, bh, mi, sambh, ra, bhudh, ra, sanskrit, for, a, mountain, of, combined, virtues, after, the, ten, stages, of, boddhisattvahood, was, the, original, name, of, borobudur, approximately, 40, kilometres, 25, mi, northwest, of, yogyakarta, and, 86, kilometres, 53, mi, west, of, surakarta, borobudur, is, located, in, an, elevated, area, between, twin, volcanoes, sundoro, sumbing, and, merbabu, merapi, and, two, rivers, the, progo, and, the, elo, according, to, local, myth, the, area, known, as, kedu, plain, is, a, javanese, sacred, place, and, has, been, dubbed, the, garden, of, java, due, to, its, high, agricultural, fertility, during, the, restoration, in, the, early, 20th, century, theodoor, van, erp, discovered, that, three, buddhist, temples, in, the, region, borobudur, pawon, and, mendut, are, positioned, along, a, straight, line, a, ritual, relationship, between, the, three, temples, must, have, existed, although, the, exact, ritual, process, is, unknown, speculation, about, a, surrounding, lake, s, existence, was, the, subject, of, intense, discussion, among, archaeologists, in, the, 20th, century, and, while, the, idea, was, explored, experts, concluded, that, a, lake, was, not, present, or, never, surrounded, the, temple, advancing, the, lake, hypothesis, in, 1931, dutch, painter, w, o, j, nieuwenkamp, thought, borobudur, represented, a, lotus, flower, floating, on, a, lake, in, what, is, now, the, kedu, plain, in, 2004, others, claimed, that, borobudur, was, built, above, the, floor, of, a, dried, out, paleolake, examining, samples, from, excavations, in, 1974, and, 1977, ganapathi, thanikaimoni, could, not, find, any, pollen, or, spores, that, would, indicate, vegetation, endemic, to, a, water, environment, jacques, dumar, ay, published, this, work, in, 1977, as, did, thanikaimoni, in, 1983, caesar, vo, te, and, j, j, nossin, made, field, studies, in, 1985, 86, that, confirmed, the, absence, of, a, lake, around, borobudur, when, it, was, built, hindu, clerics, appealed, to, the, people, of, java, for, generations, a, fact, that, architect, and, author, jacques, dumar, ay, finds, first, mentioned, in, 450, ad, influence, of, the, sailendra, and, sanjaya, dynasties, followed, dumar, ay, says, that, de, casparis, concluded, that, sanjaya, and, sailendra, shared, power, in, central, java, for, a, century, and, a, half, and, that, de, casparis, traced, alternating, succession, from, 732, until, 882, during, this, time, many, hindu, and, buddhist, monuments, were, built, on, the, plains, and, mountains, around, the, kedu, plain, buddhist, monuments, including, borobudur, were, erected, around, the, same, period, as, the, hindu, prambanan, temple, compound, in, 732, ad, king, sanjaya, commissioned, a, shivalinga, sanctuary, to, be, built, on, the, wukir, hill, only, 10, km, 6, 2, mi, east, of, borobudur, there, are, no, known, records, of, construction, or, the, intended, purpose, of, borobudur, the, duration, of, construction, has, been, estimated, by, comparison, of, carved, reliefs, on, the, temple, s, hidden, foot, and, the, inscriptions, commonly, used, in, royal, charters, during, the, 8th, and, 9th, centuries, comparison, of, an, indian, architectural, process, across, temples, and, acknowledgment, of, who, was, in, power, enabled, dumar, ay, to, approximately, date, the, construction, of, borobudur, in, five, stages, loosely, the, sailendra, began, c, 780, and, continued, stages, two, and, three, c, 792, through, to, an, unremarkable, fourth, stage, during, their, decline, c, 824, the, sanjaya, completed, borobudur, s, fifth, stage, c, 833, construction, of, buddhist, temples, including, borobudur, at, that, time, was, possible, because, sanjaya, s, immediate, successor, rakai, panangkaran, granted, his, permission, to, the, buddhist, followers, to, build, such, temples, in, fact, to, show, his, respect, panangkaran, gave, the, village, of, kalasan, to, the, buddhist, community, as, is, written, in, the, kalasan, charter, dated, 779, ad, this, has, led, some, archaeologists, to, believe, that, there, was, never, serious, conflict, concerning, religion, in, java, as, it, was, possible, for, a, hindu, king, to, patronize, the, establishment, of, a, buddhist, monument, or, for, a, buddhist, king, to, act, likewise, the, 856, battle, on, the, ratubaka, plateau, was, much, after, and, was, a, political, battle, there, was, a, climate, of, peaceful, coexistence, where, sailendra, involvement, existed, in, prambanan, borobudur, lay, hidden, for, centuries, under, layers, of, volcanic, ash, and, jungle, growth, the, facts, behind, its, abandonment, remain, a, mystery, it, is, not, known, when, active, use, of, the, monument, and, buddhist, pilgrimage, to, it, ceased, sometime, between, 928, and, 1006, king, mpu, sindok, moved, the, capital, of, the, mataram, kingdom, to, the, region, of, east, java, after, a, series, of, volcanic, eruptions, it, is, not, certain, whether, this, influenced, the, abandonment, but, several, sources, mention, this, as, the, most, likely, period, of, abandonment, the, monument, is, mentioned, vaguely, as, late, as, c, 1365, in, mpu, prapanca, s, nagarakretagama, written, during, the, majapahit, era, and, mentioning, the, vihara, in, budur, raden, soekmono, mentioned, the, assumption, of, the, temple, abandonment, which, occurred, after, the, population, had, converted, to, islam, in, the, 15th, century, the, monument, was, not, forgotten, completely, and, folk, stories, gradually, became, superstitious, beliefs, associated, with, bad, luck, and, misery, which, soekmono, relates, according, to, the, babad, tanah, jawi, or, the, history, of, java, the, monument, was, a, fatal, factor, for, a, rebel, who, revolted, against, the, king, of, mataram, in, 1709, the, insurgent, was, defeated, and, sentenced, to, death, in, the, babad, mataram, or, the, history, of, the, mataram, kingdom, the, monument, was, associated, with, the, misfortune, of, the, crown, prince, of, the, yogyakarta, sultanate, in, 1757, in, spite, of, a, taboo, against, visiting, the, monument, the, prince, took, such, pity, on, the, knight, who, was, captured, in, a, cage, i, e, the, statue, in, one, of, the, perforated, stupas, that, he, could, not, help, coming, to, see, his, unfortunate, friend, upon, returning, to, his, palace, the, prince, fell, ill, and, died, one, day, later, following, its, capture, java, was, under, british, administration, from, 1811, to, 1816, britain, s, representative, and, governor, general, was, stamford, raffles, who, took, great, interest, in, the, history, of, java, he, collected, javanese, antiques, and, made, notes, through, contacts, with, local, inhabitants, during, his, tour, throughout, the, island, on, an, inspection, tour, to, semarang, in, 1814, he, was, informed, about, a, big, monument, deep, in, a, jungle, near, the, village, of, bumisegoro, he, sent, hermann, cornelius, a, dutch, engineer, who, among, other, antiquity, explorations, had, uncovered, the, sewu, complex, in, 1806, 07, to, investigate, in, two, months, cornelius, and, his, 200, men, cut, down, trees, burned, down, vegetation, and, dug, away, the, earth, to, reveal, the, monument, due, to, the, danger, of, collapse, he, could, not, unearth, all, galleries, cornelius, reported, his, findings, to, raffles, including, various, drawings, although, raffles, mentioned, the, discovery, in, only, a, few, sentences, in, his, book, and, did, not, visit, the, site, himself, he, has, been, credited, with, the, monument, s, rediscovery, as, the, one, who, had, brought, it, to, the, world, s, attention, christiaan, lodewijk, hartmann, the, resident, of, the, kedu, region, continued, cornelius, s, work, and, in, 1835, the, whole, complex, was, finally, unearthed, his, interest, in, borobudur, was, more, personal, than, official, hartmann, did, not, write, any, reports, of, his, activities, in, particular, the, alleged, story, that, he, discovered, the, large, statue, of, buddha, in, the, main, stupa, in, 1842, hartmann, investigated, the, main, dome,

in, 1859, the, government, intended, to, publish, an, article, based, on, brumund, s, study, supplemented, by, wilsen, s, drawings, but, brumund, refused, to, cooperate, the, government, then,

sciences, to, undertake, a, thorough, investigation, of, the, site, and, to, assess, the, actual, condition, of, the, complex, his, report, found, that, these, fears, were, unjustified, and, recommended, it, be, left, intact, borobudur, was, considered, as, the, source, of, souvenirs, and, parts, of, its, sculptures, were, looted, some, even, with, colonial, government, consent, in, 1896,

of, 34, 600, guilders, equivalent, to, 875, 176, in, 2022, the, restoration, was, completed, in, 1911, and, at, first, glance, borobudur, had, been, restored, to, its, old, glory, van, erp, went, further, by, carefully, reconstructing, the, chattra, three, tiered, parasol, pinnacle, on, top, of, the, main, stupa, however, he, later, dismantled, the, chattra, citing, that, there, were, not, enough, original, stones, used, in, reconstructing, the, pinnacle, which, means, that, the, original, design, of, borobudur, s, pinnacle, is, actually, unknown, the, dismantled, chattra, now, is, stored, in, karmawibhangga, museum, a, few, hundred, meters, north, from, borobudur, due, to, the, limited, budget, the, restoration, had, been, primarily, focused, on, cleaning, the, sculptures, and,

one, million, stones, were, dismantled, and, removed, during, the, restoration, and, set, aside, like, pieces, of, a, massive, jig, saw, puzzle, to, be, individually, identified, catalogued, cleaned, and, treated, for, preservation, borobudur, became, a, testing, ground, for, new, conservation, techniques, including, new, procedures, to, battle, the, microorganisms, attacking, the, stone, the, attempt, was, made, to, restore, the, structure, as, much, as, possible, using, reassembled, original, materials, anastylosis, method, with, new, andesite, stone, blocks, used, sparingly, to, replaces, some, missing, stones, only, to, ensure, structural, integrity, the, foundation, was, stabilized, and, all, 1, 460, panels, were, cleaned, the, restoration, involved, the, dismantling, of,

government, is, aiming, to, increase, the, number, of, tourists, to, 2, million, per, year, the, archaeological, excavation, into, borobudur, during, reconstruction, suggests, that, adherents, of, hinduism, or, a, pre, indic, faith, had, already, begun, to, erect, a, large, structure, on, borobudur, s, hill, before, the, site, was, appropriated, by, buddhists, the, foundations, are, unlike, any, hindu, or, buddhist, shrine, structures, and, therefore, the, initial, structure, is, considered, more, indigenous, javanese, than, hindu, or, buddhist, borobudur, is, built, as, a, single, large, stupa, and, when, viewed, from, above, takes, the, form, of, a, giant, tantric, buddhist, mandala, simultaneously, representing, the, buddhist, cosmology, and, the, nature, of, mind, some, scholars, reject, the, idea, that, it, is, a, mandala, because, in, their, view, no, evidence, is, present, to, suggest, that, the, shailendras, were, followers, of, tantric, or, vajrayana, buddhism, moreover, the, buddhas, of, the, borobudur, do, not, identify, as, the, five, tathagatas, the, original, foundation, is, a, square, approximately, 118, metres, 387, ft, on, each, side, it, has, nine, platforms, of, which, the, lower, six, are, square, and, the, upper, three, are, circular, the, upper, platform, contains, seventy, two, small, stupas, surrounding, one, large, central, stupa, each, stupa, is, bell, shaped, and, pierced, by, numerous, decorative, openings, statues, of, the, buddha, sit, inside, the, pierced, enclosures, the, design, of, borobudur, took, the, form, of, a, step, pyramid, previously, the, prehistoric, austronesian, megalithic, culture, in, indonesia, had, constructed, several, earth, mounds, and, stone, step, pyramid, structures, called, punden, berundak, as, discovered, in, pangguyangan, site, near, cisolok, and, in, cipari, near, kuningan, the, construction, of, stone, pyramids, is, based, on, native, beliefs, that, mountains, and, high, places, are, the, abode, of, ancestral, spirits, or, hyangs, the, monument, s, three, divisions, symbolize, the, three, realms, of, buddhist, cosmology, namely, kamadhatu, the, world, of, desires, rupadhatu, the, world, of, forms, and, finally, arupadhatu, the, formless, world, ordinary, sentient, beings, live, out, their, lives, on, the, lowest, level, the, realm, of, desire, those, who, have, burnt, out, all, desire, for, continued, existence, leave, the, world, of, desire, and, live, in, the, world, on, the, level, of, form, alone, they, see, forms, but, are, not, drawn, to, them, finally, full, buddhas, go, beyond, even, form, and, experience, reality, at, its, purest, most, fundamental, level, the, formless, ocean, of, nirv, a, the, liberation, from, the, cycle, of, sa, s, ra, where, the, enlightened, seeker, is, no, longer, attached, to, worldly, form, corresponds, to, the, concept, of, s, nyat, the, complete, voidness, or, the, nonexistence, of, the, self, k, madh, tu, is, represented, by, the, base, rupadhatu, by, the, five, square, platforms, the, body, and, arupadhatu, by, the, three, circular, platforms, and, the, large, topmost, stupa, the, architectural, features, between, the, three, stages, have, metaphorical, differences, for, instance, square, and, detailed, decorations, in, the, rupadhatu, disappear, into, plain, circular, platforms, in, the, arupadhatu, to, represent, how, the, world, of, forms, where, men, are, still, attached, with, forms, and, names, changes, into, the, world, of, the, formless, congregational, worship, in, borobudur, is, performed, in, a, walking, pilgrimage, pilgrims, are, guided, by, the, system, of, staircases, and, corridors, ascending, to, the, top, platform, each, platform, represents, one, stage, of, enlightenment, the, path, that, guides, pilgrims, was, designed, to, symbolize, buddhist, cosmology, in, 1885, a, hidden, structure, under, the, base, was, accidentally, discovered, the, hidden, footing, contains, reliefs, 160, of, which, depict, narratives, describing, the, world, of, desires, the, remaining, reliefs, are, panels, with, short, inscriptions, that, apparently, provide, instructions, for, the, sculptors, illustrating, the, scenes, to, be, carved, the, real, base, is, hidden, by, an, encasement, base, the, purpose, of, which, remains, a, mystery, it, was, first, thought, that, the, real, base, had, to, be, covered, to, prevent, a, disastrous, subsidence, of, the, monument, into, the, hill, there, is, another, theory, that, the, encasement, base, was, added, because, the, original, hidden, footing, was, incorrectly, designed, according, to, vastu, shastra, the, indian, ancient, book, about, architecture, and, town, planning, regardless, of, why, it, was, commissioned, the, encasement, base, was, built, with, detailed, and, meticulous, design, and, with, aesthetic, and, religious, consideration, there, are, quite, a, few, design, similarities, between, the, borobudur, and, kesaria, sites, both, sites, have, mandalas, and, life, like, buddhas, facing, the, sections, of, the, universe, both, sites, have, hill, like, mandala, structures, filled, with, buddhist, statues, this, hints, at, the, travel, of, ritualistic, texts, and, ideas, between, the, pala, and, srivijaya, domains, approximately, 55, 000, cubic, metres, 72, 000, cu, yd, of, andesite, stones, were, taken, from, neighbouring, stone, quarries, or, from, the, bed, of, the, progo, river, to, build, the, monument, the, stone, was, cut, to, size, transported, to, the, site, and, laid, without, mortar, knobs, indentations, and, dovetails, were, used, to, form, joints, between, stones, the, roof, of, stupas, niches, and, arched, gateways, were, constructed, in, corbelling, method, reliefs, were, created, in, situ, after, the, building, had, been, completed, the, monument, is, equipped, with, a, good, drainage, system, to, cater, to, the, area, s, high, stormwater, run, off, to, prevent, flooding, 100, spouts, are, installed, at, the, corners, each, with, a, unique, carved, gargoyle, in, the, shape, of, a, giant, or, makara, borobudur, differs, markedly, from, the, general, design, of, other, structures, built, for, this, purpose, instead, of, being, built, on, a, flat, surface, borobudur, is, built, on, a, natural, hill, however, construction, technique, is, similar, to, other, temples, in, java, without, the, inner, spaces, seen, in, other, temples, and, with, a, general, design, similar, to, the, shape, of, pyramid, borobudur, was, first, thought, more, likely, to, have, served, as, a, stupa, instead, of, a, temple, a, stupa, is, intended, as, a, shrine, for, the, buddha, sometimes, stupas, were, built, only, as, devotional, symbols, of, buddhism, a, temple, on, the, other, hand, is, used, as, a, house, of, worship, the, meticulous, complexity, of, the, monument, s, design, suggests, that, borobudur, is, in, fact, a, temple, little, is, known, about, gunadharma, the, architect, of, the, complex, his, name, is, recounted, from, javanese, folk, tales, rather, than, from, written, inscriptions, the, basic, unit, of, measurement, used, during, construction, was, the, tala, defined, as, the, length, of, a, human, face, from, the, forehead, s, hairline, to, the, tip, of, the, chin, or, the, distance, from, the, tip, of, the, thumb, to, the, tip, of, the, middle, finger, when, both, fingers, are, stretched, at, their, maximum, distance, the, unit, is, thus, relative, from, one, individual, to, the, next, but, the, monument, has, exact, measurements, a, survey, conducted, in, 1977, revealed, frequent, findings, of, a, ratio, of, 4, 6, 9, around, the, monument, the, architect, had, used, the, formula, to, lay, out, the, precise, dimensions, of, the, fractal, and, self, similar, geometry, in, borobudur, s, design, this, ratio, is, also, found, in, the, designs, of, pawon, and, mendut, nearby, buddhist, temples, archeologists, have, conjectured, that, the, 4, 6, 9, ratio, and, the, tala, have, calendrical, astronomical, and, cosmological, significance, as, is, the, case, with, the, temple, of, angkor, wat, in, cambodia, the, main, structure, can, be, divided, into, three, components, base, body, and, top, the, base, is, 123, m, 123, m, 404, ft, 404, ft, in, size, with, 4, metres, 13, ft, walls, the, body, is, composed, of, five, square, platforms, each, of, diminishing, height, the, first, terrace, is, set, back, 7, metres, 23, ft, from, the, edge, of, the, base, each, subsequent, terrace, is, set, back, 2, metres, 6, 6, ft, leaving, a, narrow, corridor, at, each, stage, the, top, consists, of, three, circular, platforms, with, each, stage, supporting, a, row, of, perforated, stupas, arranged, in, concentric, circles, there, is, one, main, dome, at, the, center, the, top, of, which, is, the, highest, point, of, the, monument, 35, metres, 115, ft, above, ground, level, stairways, at, the, center, of, each, of, the, four, sides, give, access, to, the, top, with, a, number, of, arched, gates, overlooked, by, 32, lion, statues, the, gates, are, adorned, with, kala, s, head, carved, on, top, of, each, and, makaras, projecting, from, each, side, this, kala, makara, motif, is, commonly, found, on, the, gates, of, javanese, temples, the, main, entrance, is, on, the, eastern, side, the, location, of, the, first, narrative, reliefs, stairways, on, the, slopes, of, the, hill, also, link, the, monument, to, the, low, lying, plain, borobudur, is, constructed, in, such, a, way, that, it, reveals, various, levels, of, terraces, showing, intricate, architecture, that, goes, from, being, heavily, ornamented, with, bas, reliefs, to, being, plain, in, arupadhatu, circular, terraces, the, first, four, terrace, walls, are, showcases, for, bas, relief, sculptures, these, are, considered, to, be, among, the, finest, works, of, art, in, the, buddhist, world, the, bas, reliefs, in, borobudur, depicted, many, scenes, of, daily, life, in, 8th, century, ancient, java, from, the, courtly, palace, life, hermit, in, the, forest, to, those, of, commoners, in, the, village, it, also,
