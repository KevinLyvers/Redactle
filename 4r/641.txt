an, adaptation, by, dudley, nichols, of, the, stage, to, lordsburg, a, short, story, by, ernest, haycox, the, film, rights, to, the, work, were, bought, by, john, ford, soon, after, it, was, published, in, collier, s, magazine, on, april, 10, 1937, according, to, thomas, schatz, ford, claimed, that, his, inspiration, in, expanding, stagecoach, beyond, the, bare, bones, plot, created, by, haycox, was, his, familiarity, with, another, short, story, boule, de, suif, by, guy, de, maupassant, although, schatz, believes, this, scarcely, holds, up, to, scrutiny, ford, s, statement, also, seems, to, be, the, basis, for, the, claim, that, haycox, himself, relied, upon, guy, de, maupassant, s, story, however, according, to, a, haycox, biographer, there, is, no, direct, evidence, of, haycox, being, familiar, with, maupassant, s, tale, especially, as, he, was, documented, as, going, out, of, his, way, to, avoid, reading, the, work, of, others, that, might, unconsciously, influence, his, writing, and, he, focused, his, personal, reading, in, the, area, of, history, before, production, ford, shopped, the, project, around, to, several, hollywood, studios, all, of, which, turned, him, down, because, big, budget, westerns, had, been, out, of, vogue, since, the, silents, and, because, ford, insisted, on, using, then, b, movie, actor, john, wayne, in, the, key, role, in, the, film, independent, producer, david, o, selznick, finally, agreed, to, produce, it, but, was, frustrated, by, ford, s, indecision, about, when, shooting, would, begin, and, had, his, own, doubts, over, the, casting, ford, withdrew, the, film, from, selznick, s, company, and, approached, independent, producer, walter, wanger, about, the, project, wanger, had, the, same, reservations, about, producing, an, a, western, and, even, more, about, one, starring, john, wayne, ford, had, not, directed, a, western, since, the, silent, days, wanger, said, he, would, not, risk, his, money, unless, ford, replaced, john, wayne, with, gary, cooper, and, brought, in, marlene, dietrich, to, play, dallas, ford, refused, to, budge, it, would, be, wayne, or, no, one, eventually, the, pair, compromised, with, wanger, putting, up, 250, 000, a, little, more, than, half, of, what, ford, had, been, seeking, and, ford, would, give, top, billing, to, claire, trevor, better, known, than, john, wayne, at, the, time, the, members, of, the, production, crew, were, billeted, in, kayenta, in, northeastern, arizona, in, an, old, ccc, camp, conditions, were, spartan, production, hours, long, and, weather, conditions, at, the, 5, 700, ft, 1, 700, m, elevation, were, extreme, with, constant, strong, winds, and, low, temperatures, nonetheless, director, john, ford, was, satisfied, with, the, crew, s, location, work, which, took, place, near, goulding, s, trading, post, on, the, utah, border, about, 25, miles, from, kayenta, additional, scenes, were, filmed, in, monument, valley, locations, as, well, as, the, iverson, movie, ranch, and, the, rko, encino, ranch, stagecoach, was, the, first, of, many, westerns, that, ford, shot, using, monument, valley, as, a, location, many, of, which, also, starred, john, wayne, anatopic, incongruencies, of, landscape, and, vegetation, are, thus, evident, throughout, the, film, up, to, the, closing, scene, of, ringo, and, dallas, departing, lordsburg, in, the, chihuahuan, desert, of, southwestern, new, mexico, by, way, of, the, unmistakable, topography, of, monument, valley, s, colorado, plateau, location, the, film, was, released, on, 2, march, 1939, and, met, with, immediate, critical, and, trade, paper, praise, the, picture, cemented, john, wayne, s, standing, as, an, a, list, leading, man, and, made, a, profit, of, 297, 690, cast, member, louise, platt, in, a, letter, recounting, the, experience, of, the, film, s, production, quoted, ford, on, saying, of, wayne, s, future, in, film, he, ll, be, the, biggest, star, ever, because, he, is, the, perfect, everyman, on, rotten, tomatoes, the, film, holds, an, approval, rating, of, 100, based, on, 47, reviews, with, an, average, rating, of, 9, 3, 10, the, site, s, consensus, reads, typifying, the, best, that, the, western, genre, has, to, offer, stagecoach, is, a, rip, roaring, adventure, given, dramatic, heft, by, john, ford, s, dynamic, direction, and, john, wayne, s, mesmerizing, star, turn, stagecoach, has, been, lauded, as, one, of, the, most, influential, films, ever, made, orson, welles, argued, that, it, was, a, perfect, textbook, of, filmmaking, and, claimed, to, have, watched, it, more, than, 40, times, in, preparation, for, the, making, of, citizen, kane, in, 1995, the, film, was, deemed, culturally, historically, or, aesthetically, significant, by, the, united, states, library, of, congress, and, selected, for, preservation, in, their, national, film, registry, the, film, has, been, recognized, as, transcending, the, western, genre, robert, b, pippin, has, observed, that, both, the, collection, of, characters, and, their, journey, are, archetypal, rather, than, merely, individual, and, that, the, film, is, a, mythic, representation, of, the, american, aspiration, toward, a, form, of, politically, meaningful, equality, nevertheless, its, depiction, of, native, americans, is, not, above, criticism, writing, in, 2011, roger, ebert, noted, the, film, s, attitudes, toward, native, americans, are, unenlightened, the, apaches, are, seen, simply, as, murderous, savages, there, is, no, suggestion, the, white, men, have, invaded, their, land, the, film, was, originally, released, through, united, artists, but, under, the, terms, of, its, seven, year, rights, rule, the, company, surrendered, distribution, rights, to, producer, walter, wanger, in, 1946, numerous, companies, have, held, the, rights, to, the, picture, in, the, years, since, the, film, s, copyright, originally, by, walter, wanger, productions, was, renewed, by, 20th, century, fox, which, produced, a, later, 1966, remake, of, stagecoach, the, rights, to, the, original, 1939, film, were, subsequently, acquired, by, time, life, films, during, the, 1970s, the, copyright, has, since, been, reassigned, to, wanger, productions, through, the, late, producer, s, family, under, the, caidin, trust, caidin, film, company, the, ancillary, rights, holder, however, distribution, rights, are, now, held, by, shout, factory, which, in, 2014, acquired, jumer, productions, westchester, films, which, in, turn, had, bought, the, caidin, film, holdings, after, the, folding, of, former, distributor, castle, hill, productions, warner, bros, pictures, handles, sales, and, additional, distribution, the, original, negative, of, stagecoach, was, either, lost, or, destroyed, wayne, had, one, unscreened, positive, print, that, director, peter, bogdanovich, noticed, in, wayne, s, garage, while, visiting, in, 1970, wayne, allowed, it, to, be, used, to, produce, a, new, negative, often, seen, at, film, festivals, ucla, fully, restored, the, film, in, 1996, from, surviving, elements, and, premiered, it, on, cable, s, american, movie, classics, network, the, previous, dvd, releases, by, warner, home, video, did, not, contain, the, restored, print, but, rather, a, video, print, held, in, the, castle, hill, caidin, trust, library, a, digitally, restored,

which, played, august, 22, 1945, most, main, characters, in, the, movie, had, a, counter, part, in, the, radio, play, the, plot, of, the, radio, play, paralleled, that, of, the, movie, quite, closely, in, spite, of, the, character, changes, with, exception, of, the, lone, ranger, and, tonto, heroically, saving, the, stagecoach, occupants, from, geronimo, s, warriors, the, radio, play, run, time, was, only, about, 22, minutes, less, than, one, quarter, of, the, movie, s, 96, consequently, character, and, plot, development, had, to, be, accelerated, which, resulted, in, weakening, the,
