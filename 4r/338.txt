the, viola, v, i, o, l, vee, oh, l, italian, is, a, string, instrument, of, the, violin, family, and, is, usually, bowed, when, played, violas, are, slightly, larger, than, a, violin, it, has, a, lower, and, deeper, sound, since, the, 18th, century, it, has, been, the, middle, or, alto, voice, of, the, violin, family, between, the, violin, which, is, tuned, a, perfect, fifth, higher, and, the, cello, which, is, tuned, an, octave, lower, the, strings, from, low, to, high, are, typically, tuned, to, c, 3, g, 3, d, 4, and, a, 4, in, the, past, the, viola, varied, in, size, and, style, as, did, its, names, the, word, viola, originates, from, the, italian, language, the, italians, often, used, the, term, viola, da, braccio, meaning, literally, of, the, arm, brazzo, was, another, italian, word, for, the, viola, which, the, germans, adopted, as, bratsche, the, french, had, their, own, names, cinquiesme, was, a, small, viola, haute, contre, was, a, large, viola, and, taile, was, a, tenor, today, the, french, use, the, term, alto, a, reference, to, its, range, the, viola, was, popular, in, the, heyday, of, five, part, harmony, up, until, the, eighteenth, century, taking, three, lines, of, the, harmony, and, occasionally, playing, the, melody, line, music, for, the, viola, differs, from, most, other, instruments, in, that, it, primarily, uses, the, alto, clef, when, viola, music, has, substantial, sections, in, a, higher, register, it, switches, to, the, treble, clef, to, make, it, easier, to, read, the, viola, often, plays, the, inner, voices, in, string, quartets, and, symphonic, writing, and, it, is, more, likely, than, the, first, violin, to, play, accompaniment, parts, the, viola, occasionally, plays, a, major, soloistic, role, in, orchestral, or, chamber, music, examples, include, the, symphonic, poem, don, quixote, by, richard, strauss, the, 13th, quartet, by, dmitri, shostakovich, and, a, symphony, with, a, main, viola, line, harold, en, italie, by, hector, berlioz, in, the, earlier, part, of, the, 20th, century, more, composers, began, to, write, for, the, viola, encouraged, by, the, emergence, of, specialized, soloists, such, as, lionel, tertis, and, william, primrose, english, composers, arthur, bliss, edwin, york, bowen, benjamin, dale, frank, bridge, benjamin, britten, rebecca, clarke, and, ralph, vaughan, williams, all, wrote, substantial, chamber, and, concert, works, many, of, these, pieces, were, commissioned, by, or, written, for, tertis, william, walton, bohuslav, martin, t, ru, takemitsu, tibor, serly, alfred, schnittke, and, b, la, bart, k, have, written, well, known, viola, concertos, the, concerti, by, bart, k, paul, hindemith, carl, stamitz, georg, philipp, telemann, and, walton, are, considered, major, works, of, the, viola, repertoire, hindemith, who, was, a, violist, wrote, a, substantial, amount, of, music, for, viola, including, the, concerto, der, schwanendreher, the, viola, is, similar, in, material, and, construction, to, the, violin, a, full, size, viola, s, body, is, between, 25, and, 100, mm, 1, and, 4, in, longer, than, the, body, of, a, full, size, violin, i, e, between, 38, and, 46, cm, with, an, average, length, of, 41, cm, 16, in, small, violas, typically, made, for, children, typically, start, at, 30, cm, 12, in, which, is, equivalent, to, a, half, size, violin, for, a, child, who, needs, a, smaller, size, a, fractional, sized, violin, is, often, strung, with, the, strings, of, a, viola, unlike, the, violin, the, viola, does, not, have, a, standard, full, size, the, body, of, a, viola, would, need, to, measure, about, 51, cm, 20, in, long, to, match, the, acoustics, of, a, violin, however, it, can, only, be, played, vertically, like, a, cello, hence, the, name, vertical, viola, for, centuries, viola, makers, have, experimented, with, the, size, and, shape, of, the, viola, often, adjusting, proportions, or, shape, to, make, a, lighter, instrument, with, shorter, string, lengths, but, with, a, large, enough, sound, box, to, retain, the, viola, sound, prior, to, the, eighteenth, century, violas, had, no, uniform, size, large, violas, tenors, were, designed, to, play, the, lower, register, viola, lines, or, second, viola, in, five, part, harmony, depending, on, instrumentation, a, smaller, viola, nearer, the, size, of, the, violin, was, called, an, alto, viola, it, was, more, suited, to, higher, register, writing, as, in, the, viola, 1, parts, as, their, sound, was, usually, richer, in, the, upper, register, its, size, was, not, as, conducive, to, a, full, tone, in, the, lower, register, several, experiments, have, intended, to, increase, the, size, of, the, viola, to, improve, its, sound, and, harmony, hermann, ritter, s, viola, alta, which, measured, about, 48, cm, 19, in, was, intended, for, use, in, wagner, s, operas, the, tertis, model, viola, which, has, wider, bouts, and, deeper, ribs, to, promote, a, better, tone, is, another, slightly, nonstandard, shape, that, allows, the, player, to, use, a, larger, instrument, many, experiments, with, the, acoustics, of, a, viola, particularly, increasing, the, size, of, the, body, have, resulted, in, a, much, deeper, tone, making, it, resemble, the, tone, of, a, cello, since, many, composers, wrote, for, a, traditional, sized, viola, particularly, in, orchestral, music, changes, in, the, tone, of, a, viola, can, have, unintended, consequences, upon, the, balance, in, ensembles, one, of, the, most, notable, makers, of, violas, of, the, twentieth, century, was, englishman, a, e, smith, whose, violas, are, sought, after, and, highly, valued, many, of, his, violas, remain, in, australia, his, country, of, residence, where, during, some, decades, the, violists, of, the, sydney, symphony, orchestra, had, a, dozen, of, them, in, their, section, more, recent, and, more, radically, shaped, innovations, have, addressed, the, ergonomic, problems, associated, with, playing, the, viola, by, making, it, shorter, and, lighter, while, finding, ways, to, keep, the, traditional, sound, these, include, the, otto, erdesz, cutaway, viola, which, has, one, shoulder, cut, out, to, make, shifting, easier, the, oak, leaf, viola, which, has, two, extra, bouts, viol, shaped, violas, such, as, joseph, curtin, s, evia, model, which, also, uses, a, moveable, neck, and, maple, veneered, carbon, fibre, back, to, reduce, weight, violas, played, in, the, same, manner, as, cellos, see, vertical, viola, and, the, eye, catching, dal, esque, shapes, of, both, bernard, sabatier, s, violas, in, fractional, sizes, which, appear, to, have, melted, and, david, rivinus, pellegrina, model, violas, other, experiments, that, deal, with, the, ergonomics, vs, sound, problem, have, appeared, the, american, composer, harry, partch, fitted, a, viola, with, a, cello, neck, to, allow, the, use, of, his, 43, tone, scale, called, the, adapted, viola, luthiers, have, also, created, five, stringed, violas, which, allow, a, greater, playing, range, a, person, who, plays, the, viola, is, called, a, violist, or, a, viola, player, the, technique, required, for, playing, a, viola, has, certain, differences, compared, with, that, of, a, violin, partly, because, of, its, larger, size, the, notes, are, spread, out, farther, along, the, fingerboard, and, often, require, different, fingerings, the, viola, s, less, responsive, strings, and, the, heavier, bow, warrant, a, somewhat, different, bowing, technique, and, a, violist, has, to, lean, more, intensely, on, the, strings, the, viola, is, held, in, the, same, manner, as, the, violin, however, due, to, its, larger, size, some, adjustments, must, be, made, to, accommodate, the, viola, just, like, the, violin, is, placed, on, top, of, the, left, shoulder, between, the, shoulder, and, the, left, side, of, the, face, chin, because, of, the, viola, s, size, violists, with, short, arms, tend, to, use, smaller, sized, instruments, for, easier, playing, the, most, immediately, noticeable, adjustments, that, a, player, accustomed, to, playing, the, violin, has, to, make, are, to, use, wider, spaced, fingerings, it, is, common, for, some, players, to, use, a, wider, and, more, intense, vibrato, in, the, left, hand, facilitated, by, employing, the, fleshier, pad, of, the, finger, rather, than, the, tip, and, to, hold, the, bow, and, right, arm, farther, away, from, the, player, s, body, a, violist, must, bring, the, left, elbow, farther, forward, or, around, so, as, to, reach, the, lowest, string, which, allows, the, fingers, to, press, firmly, and, so, create, a, clearer, tone, different, positions, are, often, used, including, half, position, the, viola, is, strung, with, thicker, gauge, strings, than, the, violin, this, combined, with, its, larger, size, and, lower, pitch, range, results, in, a, deeper, and, mellower, tone, however, the, thicker, strings, also, mean, that, the, viola, responds, to, changes, in, bowing, more, slowly, practically, speaking, if, a, violist, and, violinist, are, playing, together, the, violist, must, begin, moving, the, bow, a, fraction, of, a, second, sooner, than, the, violinist, the, thicker, strings, also, mean, that, more, weight, must, be, applied, with, the, bow, to, make, them, vibrate, the, viola, s, bow, has, a, wider, band, of, horsehair, than, a, violin, s, bow, which, is, particularly, noticeable, near, the, frog, or, heel, in, the, uk, viola, bows, at, 70, 74, g, 2, 5, 2, 6, oz, are, heavier, than, violin, bows, 58, 61, g, the, profile, of, the, rectangular, outside, corner, of, a, viola, bow, frog, generally, is, more, rounded, than, on, violin, bows, the, viola, s, four, strings, are, normally, tuned, in, fifths, the, lowest, string, is, c, an, octave, below, middle, c, with, g, d, and, a, above, it, this, tuning, is, exactly, one, fifth, below, the, violin, so, that, they, have, three, strings, in, common, g, d, and, a, and, is, one, octave, above, the, cello, each, string, of, a, viola, is, wrapped, around, a, peg, near, the, scroll, and, is, tuned, by, turning, the, peg, tightening, the, string, raises, the, pitch, loosening, the, string, lowers, the, pitch, the, a, string, is, normally, tuned, first, to, the, pitch, of, the, ensemble, generally, 400, 442, hz, the, other, strings, are, then, tuned, to, it, in, intervals, of, fifths, usually, by, bowing, two, strings, simultaneously, most, violas, also, have, adjusters, fine, tuners, particularly, on, the, a, string, that, make, finer, changes, these, adjust, the, tension, of, the, string, via, rotating, a, small, knob, above, the, tailpiece, such, tuning, is, generally, easier, to, learn, than, using, the, pegs, and, adjusters, are, usually, recommended, for, younger, players, and, put, on, smaller, violas, though, pegs, and, adjusters, are, usually, used, together, some, violists, reverse, the, stringing, of, the, c, and, g, pegs, so, that, the, thicker, c, string, does, not, turn, so, severe, an, angle, over, the, nut, although, this, is, uncommon, small, temporary, tuning, adjustments, can, also, be, made, by, stretching, a, string, with, the, hand, a, string, may, be, tuned, down, by, pulling, it, above, the, fingerboard, or, tuned, up, by, pressing, the, part, of, the, string, in, the, pegbox, these, techniques, may, be, useful, in, performance, reducing, the, ill, effects, of, an, out, of, tune, string, until, an, opportunity, to, tune, properly, the, tuning, c, g, d, a, is, used, for, the, great, majority, of, all, viola, music, however, other, tunings, are, occasionally, employed, both, in, classical, music, where, the, technique, is, known, as, scordatura, and, in, some, folk, styles, mozart, in, his, sinfonia, concertante, for, violin, viola, and, orchestra, in, e, wrote, the, viola, part, in, d, major, and, specified, that, the, violist, raises, the, strings, in, pitch, by, a, semitone, he, probably, intended, to, give, the, viola, a, brighter, tone, so, the, rest, of, the, ensemble, would, not, overpower, it, tertis, in, his, transcription, of, the, elgar, cello, concerto, wrote, the, slow, movement, with, the, c, string, tuned, down, to, b, enabling, the, viola, to, play, one, passage, an, octave, lower, a, renewal, of, interest, in, the, viola, by, performers, and, composers, in, the, twentieth, century, led, to, increased, research, devoted, to, the, instrument, paul, hindemith, and, vadim, borisovsky, made, an, early, attempt, at, an, organization, in, 1927, with, the, violists, world, union, but, it, was, not, until, 1968, with, the, creation, of, the, viola, forschungsgesellschaft, now, the, international, viola, society, ivs, that, a, lasting, organization, took, hold, the, ivs, now, consists, of, twelve, chapters, around, the, world, the, largest, being, the, american, viola, society, avs, which, publishes, the, journal, of, the, american, viola, society, in, addition, to, the, journal, the, avs, sponsors, the, david, dalton, research, competition, and, the, primrose, international, viola, competition, the, 1960s, also, saw, the, beginning, of, several, research, publications, devoted, to, the, viola, beginning, with, franz, zeyringer, s, literatur, f, r, viola, which, has, undergone, several, versions, the, most, recent, being, in, 1985, in, 1980, maurice, riley, produced, the, first, attempt, at, a, comprehensive, history, of, the, viola, in, his, history, of, the, viola, which, was, followed, with, the, second, volume, in, 1991, the, ivs, published, the, multi, language, viola, yearbook, from, 1979, to, 1994, during, which, several, other, national, chapters, of, the, ivs, published, respective, newsletters, the, primrose, international, viola, archive, at, brigham, young, university, houses, the, greatest, amount, of, material, related, to, the, viola, including, scores, recordings, instruments, and, archival, materials, from, some, of, the, world, s, greatest, violists, music, that, is, written, for, the, viola, primarily, uses, the, alto, clef, which, is, otherwise, rarely, used, viola, music, employs, the, treble, clef, when, there, are, substantial, sections, of, music, written, in, a, higher, register, the, alto, clef, is, defined, by, the, placement, of, c, 4, on, the, middle, line, of, the, staff, as, the, viola, is, tuned, exactly, one, octave, above, the, cello, music, that, is, notated, for, the, cello, can, be, easily, transcribed, for, alto, clef, without, any, changes, in, key, for, example, there, are, numerous, editions, of, bach, s, cello, suites, transcribed, for, viola, the, viola, also, has, the, advantage, of, smaller, scale, length, which, means, that, the, stretches, needed, by, cellists, to, play, the, piece, are, easier, to, achieve, on, the, viola, however, occasional, changes, must, be, made, due, to, differences, in, the, ways, that, the, two, instruments, are, played, as, well, as, their, differences, in, range, in, early, orchestral, music, the, viola, part, was, usually, limited, to, filling, in, harmonies, with, very, little, melodic, material, assigned, to, it, when, the, viola, was, given, a, melodic, part, it, was, often, duplicated, or, was, in, unison, with, the, melody, played, by, other, strings, the, concerti, grossi, brandenburg, concertos, composed, by, j, s, bach, were, unusual, in, their, use, of, viola, the, third, concerto, grosso, scored, for, three, violins, three, violas, three, cellos, and, basso, continuo, requires, virtuosity, from, the, violists, indeed, viola, i, has, a, solo, in, the, last, movement, which, is, commonly, found, in, orchestral, auditions, the, sixth, concerto, grosso, brandenburg, concerto, no, 6, which, was, scored, for, 2, violas, concertino, cello, 2, violas, da, gamba, and, continuo, had, the, two, violas, playing, the, primary, melodic, role, he, also, used, this, unusual, ensemble, in, his, cantata, gleichwie, der, regen, und, schnee, vom, himmel, f, llt, bwv, 18, and, in, mein, herze, schwimmt, im, blut, bwv, 199, the, chorale, is, accompanied, by, an, obbligato, viola, there, are, a, few, baroque, and, classical, concerti, such, as, those, by, georg, philipp, telemann, one, for, solo, viola, being, one, of, the, earliest, viola, concertos, known, and, one, for, two, violas, alessandro, rolla, franz, anton, hoffmeister, and, carl, stamitz, the, viola, plays, an, important, role, in, chamber, music, mozart, used, the, viola, in, more, creative, ways, when, he, wrote, his, six, string, quintets, the, viola, quintets, use, two, violas, which, frees, them, especially, the, first, viola, for, solo, passages, and, increases, the, variety, of, writing, that, is, possible, for, the, ensemble, mozart, also, wrote, for, the, viola, in, his, sinfonia, concertante, a, set, of, two, duets, for, violin, and, viola, and, the, kegelstatt, trio, for, viola, clarinet, and, piano, the, young, felix, mendelssohn, wrote, a, little, known, viola, sonata, in, c, minor, without, opus, number, but, dating, from, 1824, robert, schumann, wrote, his, m, rchenbilder, for, viola, and, piano, he, also, wrote, a, set, of, four, pieces, for, clarinet, viola, and, piano, m, rchenerz, hlungen, max, bruch, wrote, a, romance, for, viola, and, orchestra, his, op, 85, which, explores, the, emotive, capabilities, of, the, viola, s, timbre, in, addition, his, eight, pieces, for, clarinet, viola, and, piano, op, 83, features, the, viola, in, a, very, prominent, solo, aspect, throughout, his, concerto, for, clarinet, viola, and, orchestra, op, 88, has, been, quite, prominent, in, the, repertoire, and, has, been, recorded, by, prominent, violists, throughout, the, 20th, century, from, his, earliest, works, brahms, wrote, music, that, prominently, featured, the, viola, among, his, first, published, pieces, of, chamber, music, the, sextets, for, strings, op, 18, and, op, 36, contain, what, amounts, to, solo, parts, for, both, violas, late, in, life, he, wrote, two, greatly, admired, sonatas, for, clarinet, and, piano, his, op, 120, 1894, he, later, transcribed, these, works, for, the, viola, the, solo, part, in, his, horn, trio, is, also, available, in, a, transcription, for, viola, brahms, also, wrote, two, songs, for, voice, viola, and, piano, op, 91, gestillte, sehnsucht, satisfied, longing, and, geistliches, wiegenlied, spiritual, lullaby, as, presents, for, the, famous, violinist, joseph, joachim, and, his, wife, amalie, dvo, k, played, the, viola, and, apparently, said, that, it, was, his, favorite, instrument, his, chamber, music, is, rich, in, important, parts, for, the, viola, two, czech, composers, bed, ich, smetana, and, leo, jan, ek, included, significant, viola, parts, originally, written, for, viola, d, amore, in, their, quartets, from, my, life, and, intimate, letters, respectively, the, quartets, begin, with, an, impassioned, statement, by, the, viola, this, is, similar, to, bach, mozart, and, beethoven, all, occasionally, played, the, viola, part, in, chamber, music, the, viola, occasionally, has, a, major, role, in, orchestral, music, a, prominent, example, being, richard, strauss, tone, poem, don, quixote, for, solo, cello, and, viola, and, orchestra, other, examples, are, the, ysobel, variation, of, edward, elgar, s, enigma, variations, and, the, solo, in, his, work, in, the, south, alassio, the, pas, de, deux, scene, from, act, 2, of, adolphe, adam, s, giselle, and, the, la, paix, movement, of, l, o, delibes, s, ballet, copp, lia, which, features, a, lengthy, viola, solo, gabriel, faur, s, requiem, was, originally, scored, in, 1888, with, divided, viola, sections, lacking, the, usual, violin, sections, having, only, a, solo, violin, for, the, sanctus, it, was, later, scored, for, orchestra, with, violin, sections, and, published, in, 1901, recordings, of, the, older, scoring, with, violas, are, available, while, the, viola, repertoire, is, quite, large, the, amount, written, by, well, known, pre, 20th, century, composers, is, relatively, small, there, are, many, transcriptions, of, works, for, other, instruments, for, the, viola, and, the, large, number, of, 20th, century, compositions, is, very, diverse, see, the, viola, project, at, the, san, francisco, conservatory, of, music, where, professor, of, viola, jodi, levitz, has, paired, a, composer, with, each, of, her, students, resulting, in, a, recital, of, brand, new, works, played, for, the, very, first, time, in, the, earlier, part, of, the, 20th, century, more, composers, began, to, write, for, the, viola, encouraged, by, the, emergence, of, specialized, soloists, such, as, tertis, englishmen, arthur, bliss, edwin, york, bowen, benjamin, dale, and, ralph, vaughan, williams, all, wrote, chamber, and, concert, works, for, tertis, william, walton, bohuslav, martin, and, b, la, bart, k, wrote, well, known, viola, concertos, hindemith, wrote, a, substantial, amount, of, music, for, the, viola, being, himself, a, violist, he, often, performed, his, own, works, claude, debussy, s, sonata, for, flute, viola, and, harp, has, inspired, a, significant, number, of, other, composers, to, write, for, this, combination, charles, wuorinen, composed, his, virtuosic, viola, variations, in, 2008, for, lois, martin, elliott, carter, also, wrote, several, works, for, viola, including, his, elegy, 1943, for, viola, and, piano, it, was, subsequently, transcribed, for, clarinet, ernest, bloch, a, swiss, born, american, composer, best, known, for, his, compositions, inspired, by, jewish, music, wrote, two, famous, works, for, viola, the, suite, 1919, and, the, suite, h, bra, que, for, solo, viola, and, orchestra, rebecca, clarke, was, a, 20th, century, composer, and, violist, who, also, wrote, extensively, for, the, viola, lionel, tertis, records, that, elgar, whose, cello, concerto, tertis, transcribed, for, viola, with, the, slow, movement, in, scordatura, alexander, glazunov, who, wrote, an, elegy, op, 44, for, viola, and, piano, and, maurice, ravel, all, promised, concertos, for, viola, yet, all, three, died, before, doing, any, substantial, work, on, them, in, the, latter, part, of, the, 20th, century, a, substantial, repertoire, was, produced, for, the, viola, many, composers, including, mikl, s, r, zsa, revol, bunin, alfred, schnittke, sofia, gubaidulina, giya, kancheli, and, krzysztof, penderecki, have, written, viola, concertos, the, american, composer, morton, feldman, wrote, a, series, of, works, entitled, the, viola, in, my, life, which, feature, concertante, viola, parts, in, spectral, music, the, viola, has, been, sought, after, because, of, its, lower, overtone, partials, that, are, more, easily, heard, than, on, the, violin, spectral, composers, like, g, rard, grisey, tristan, murail, and, hora, iu, r, dulescu, have, written, solo, works, for, viola, neo, romantic, post, modern, composers, have, also, written, significant, works, for, viola, including, robin, holloway, viola, concerto, op, 56, and, sonata, op, 87, peter, seabourne, a, large, five, movement, work, with, piano, piet, airat, ichmouratov, viola, concerto, no, 1, op, 7, and, three, romances, for, viola, strings, and, harp, op, 22, the, viola, is, sometimes, used, in, contemporary, popular, music, mostly, in, the, avant, garde, john, cale, of, the, velvet, underground, used, the, viola, as, do, some, modern, groups, such, as, alternative, rock, band, 10, 000, maniacs, imagine, dragons, folk, duo, john, mary, british, sea, power, the, airborne, toxic, event, marillion, and, others, often, with, instruments, in, a, chamber, setting, jazz, music, has, also, seen, its, share, of, violists, from, those, used, in, string, sections, in, the, early, 1900s, to, a, handful, of, quartets, and, soloists, emerging, from, the, 1960s, onward, it, is, quite, unusual, though, to, use, individual, bowed, string, instruments, in, contemporary, popular, music, there, are, few, well, known, viola, virtuoso, soloists, perhaps, because, little, virtuoso, viola, music, was, written, before, the, twentieth, century, pre, twentieth, century, viola, players, of, note, include, stamitz, rolla, antonio, rolla, chr, tien, urhan, casimir, ney, louis, van, waefelghem, and, ritter, important, viola, pioneers, from, the, twentieth, century, were, tertis, william, primrose, hindemith, th, ophile, laforge, cecil, aronowitz, maurice, vieux,
