story, idea, or, commission, production, then, continues, through, screenwriting, casting, pre, production, shooting, sound, recording, post, production, and, screening, the, finished, product, before, an, audience, which, may, result, in, a, film, release, and, exhibition, the, process, is, nonlinear, as, the, director, typically, shoots, the, script, out, of, sequence, repeats, shots, as, needed, and, puts, them, together, through, editing, later, filmmaking, occurs, in, a, variety, of, economic, social, and, political, contexts, around, the, world, and, uses, a, variety, of, technologies, and, cinematic, techniques, to, make, theatrical, films, episodic, films, for, television, and, streaming, platforms, music, videos, and, promotional, and, educational, films, although, filmmaking, originally, involved, the, use, of, film, most, film, productions, are, now, digital, today, filmmaking, refers, to, the, process, of, crafting, an, audio, visual, story, commercially, for, distribution, or, broadcast, film, production, consists, of, five, major, stages, the, development, stage, contains, both, general, and, specific, components, each, film, studio, has, a, yearly, retreat, where, their, top, creative, executives, meet, and, interact, on, a, variety, of, areas, and, topics, they, wish, to, explore, through, collaborations, with, producers, and, screenwriters, and, then, ultimately, directors, actors, and, actresses, they, choose, trending, topics, from, the, media, and, real, life, as, well, as, many, other, sources, to, determine, their, yearly, agenda, for, example, in, a, year, when, action, is, popular, they, may, wish, to, explore, that, topic, in, one, or, more, movies, sometimes, they, purchase, the, rights, to, articles, bestselling, novels, plays, the, remaking, of, older, films, stories, with, some, basis, in, real, life, through, a, person, or, event, a, video, game, fairy, tale, comic, book, graphic, novel, likewise, research, through, surveys, may, inform, their, decisions, they, may, have, had, blockbusters, from, their, previous, year, and, wish, to, explore, a, sequel, they, will, additionally, acquire, a, completed, and, independently, financed, and, produced, film, such, notable, examples, are, little, miss, sunshine, the, english, patient, and, roma, studios, hold, general, meetings, with, producers, and, screenwriters, about, original, story, ideas, in, my, decade, working, as, a, writer, i, knew, of, only, a, few, that, were, sold, and, fewer, that, made, it, to, the, screen, relays, writer, wayne, powers, alan, watt, writer, director, and, founder, of, the, la, writer, s, lab, confirmed, that, completed, original, screenplays, referred, to, as, specs, make, big, news, when, they, sell, but, these, make, up, a, very, small, portion, of, movies, that, are, ultimately, given, the, green, light, to, be, produced, by, the, president, of, a, studio, the, executives, return, from, the, retreat, with, fairly, well, established, instructions, they, spread, these, concepts, through, the, industry, community, especially, to, producers, they, have, deals, with, traditional, studios, will, have, those, producers, in, offices, on, their, lots, also, agents, for, screenwriters, are, made, aware, this, results, in, a, pairing, of, producers, with, writers, where, they, develop, a, take, a, basic, story, idea, that, utilizes, the, concept, given, by, studio, executives, often, it, is, a, competition, with, several, pairings, meeting, with, studio, executives, and, pitching, their, take, very, few, writing, jobs, are, from, original, ideas, brought, to, studios, by, producers, or, writers, perhaps, one, movie, a, year, will, be, a, spec, script, that, was, purchased, once, the, producer, and, writer, have, sold, their, approach, to, the, desired, subject, matter, they, begin, to, work, however, many, writers, and, producers, usually, pass, before, a, particular, concept, is, realized, in, a, way, that, is, awarded, a, green, light, to, production, production, of, unforgiven, which, earned, oscars, for, its, director, star, clint, eastwood, as, well, as, its, screenwriter, david, webb, peoples, required, fifteen, years, powers, related, that, the, italian, job, took, approximately, eight, years, from, concept, to, screen, which, as, powers, added, is, average, and, most, concepts, turned, into, paid, screenplays, wind, up, gathering, dust, on, some, executive, s, shelf, never, to, see, production, writers, have, different, styles, and, creative, processes, some, have, stronger, track, records, than, others, because, of, this, how, the, development, process, proceeds, from, there, and, how, much, detail, a, writer, returns, to, the, studio, to, divulge, before, beginning, writing, can, vary, greatly, screenwriters, are, often, protected, by, the, union, the, writers, guild, of, america, or, wga, the, wga, allows, a, screenwriter, to, contract, for, one, draft, one, revision, and, one, polish, bob, eisle, writer, and, member, of, the, guild, board, states, additional, writing, requires, an, extension, of, contracts, and, payment, for, additional, work, they, are, paid, 80, of, their, fee, after, the, first, draft, preliminary, discussions, are, minimal, with, studio, executives, but, might, be, quite, detailed, with, the, producer, next, a, screenwriter, writes, a, screenplay, over, a, period, of, several, months, or, however, long, it, takes, deadlines, are, in, their, contracts, but, there, is, no, pressure, to, adhere, to, them, again, every, writer, s, process, and, speed, vary, the, screenwriter, may, rewrite, the, script, several, times, to, improve, dramatization, clarity, structure, characters, dialogue, and, overall, style, script, coverage, a, freelance, job, held, by, recent, university, graduates, does, not, feed, scripts, into, the, system, that, are, ready, for, production, nor, already, produced, coverage, is, a, way, for, young, screenwriters, to, be, read, and, their, ideas, might, make, their, way, up, to, an, executive, or, famous, producer, and, result, in, meet, and, greets, where, relations, with, up, and, comers, can, be, formed, but, it, has, not, historically, yielded, ideas, studios, pursue, into, production, the, studio, is, the, film, distributor, who, at, an, early, stage, attempts, to, choose, a, slate, of, concepts, that, are, likely, to, have, market, appeal, and, find, potential, financial, success, hollywood, distributors, consider, factors, such, as, the, film, genre, the, target, audience, and, assumed, audience, the, historical, success, of, similar, films, the, actors, who, might, appear, in, the, film, and, potential, directors, all, these, factors, imply, a, certain, appeal, of, the, film, to, a, possible, audience, not, all, films, make, a, profit, from, the, theatrical, release, alone, however, the, studio, mainly, targets, the, opening, weekend, and, the, second, weekend, to, make, most, domestic, profits, occasionally, a, film, called, a, word, of, mouth, film, does, not, market, strongly, but, its, success, spreads, by, word, of, mouth, it, slowly, gains, its, audience, these, are, special, circumstances, and, these, films, may, remain, in, theaters, for, 5, months, while, a, typical, film, run, is, closer, to, 5, weekends, further, earnings, result, from, pay, television, purchases, foreign, market, purchases, and, dvd, sales, to, establish, worldwide, distribution, gross, of, a, film, once, a, screenplay, is, green, lit, directors, and, actors, are, attached, and, the, film, proceeds, into, the, pre, production, stage, although, sometimes, development, and, pre, production, stages, will, overlap, projects, which, fail, to, obtain, a, green, light, may, have, protracted, difficulties, in, making, the, transition, to, pre, production, and, enter, a, phase, referred, to, as, developmental, hell, for, extended, period, of, time, or, until, developmental, turnaround, analogous, to, almost, any, business, venture, financing, of, a, film, project, deals, with, the, study, of, filmmaking, as, the, management, and, procurement, of, investments, it, includes, the, dynamics, of, assets, that, are, required, to, fund, the, filmmaking, and, liabilities, incurred, during, the, filmmaking, over, the, time, period, from, early, development, through, the, management, of, profits, and, losses, after, distribution, under, conditions, of, different, degrees, of, uncertainty, and, risk, the, practical, aspects, of, filmmaking, finance, can, also, be, defined, as, the, science, of, the, money, management, of, all, phases, involved, in, filmmaking, film, finance, aims, to, price, assets, based, on, their, risk, level, and, their, expected, rate, of, return, based, upon, anticipated, profits, and, protection, against, losses, in, pre, production, every, step, of, actually, creating, the, film, is, carefully, designed, and, planned, this, is, the, phase, where, one, would, narrow, down, all, the, options, of, the, production, it, is, where, all, the, planning, takes, place, before, the, camera, rolls, and, sets, the, overall, vision, of, the, project, the, production, company, is, created, and, a, production, office, established, the, film, is, pre, visualized, by, the, director, and, may, be, storyboarded, with, the, help, of, illustrators, and, concept, artists, a, production, budget, is, drawn, up, to, plan, expenditures, for, the, film, for, major, productions, insurance, is, procured, to, protect, against, accidents, pre, production, also, includes, working, out, the, shoot, location, and, casting, process, the, producer, hires, a, line, manager, or, a, production, manager, to, create, the, schedule, and, budget, for, the, film, the, nature, of, the, film, and, the, budget, determine, the, size, and, type, of, crew, used, during, filmmaking, many, hollywood, blockbusters, employ, a, cast, and, crew, of, hundreds, while, a, low, budget, independent, film, may, be, made, by, a, skeleton, crew, of, eight, or, nine, or, fewer, these, are, typical, crew, positions, in, production, the, film, is, created, and, shot, in, this, phase, it, is, key, to, keep, planning, ahead, of, the, daily, shoot, the, primary, aim, is, to, stick, to, the, budget, and, schedule, which, requires, constant, vigilance, more, crew, will, be, recruited, at, this, stage, such, as, the, property, master, script, supervisor, assistant, directors, stills, photographer, picture, editor, and, sound, editors, these, are, the, most, common, roles, in, filmmaking, the, production, office, will, be, free, to, create, any, unique, blend, of, roles, to, suit, the, various, responsibilities, needed, during, the, production, of, a, film, communication, is, key, between, the, location, set, office, production, company, distributors, and, all, other, parties, involved, a, typical, day, shooting, begins, with, the, crew, arriving, on, the, set, location, by, their, call, time, actors, usually, have, their, own, separate, call, times, since, set, construction, dressing, and, lighting, can, take, many, hours, or, even, days, they, are, often, set, up, in, advance, the, grip, electric, and, production, design, crews, are, typically, a, step, ahead, of, the, camera, and, sound, departments, for, efficiency, s, sake, while, a, scene, is, being, filmed, they, are, already, preparing, the, next, one, while, the, crew, prepares, their, equipment, the, actors, do, their, costumes, and, attend, the, hair, and, make, up, departments, the, actors, rehearse, the, script, and, blocking, with, the, director, and, the, camera, and, sound, crews, rehearse, with, them, and, make, final, tweaks, finally, the, action, is, shot, in, as, many, takes, as, the, director, wishes, most, american, productions, follow, a, specific, procedure, the, assistant, director, ad, calls, picture, is, up, to, inform, everyone, that, a, take, is, about, to, be, recorded, and, then, quiet, everyone, once, everyone, is, ready, to, shoot, the, ad, calls, roll, sound, if, the, take, involves, sound, and, the, production, sound, mixer, will, start, their, equipment, record, a, verbal, slate, of, the, take, s, information, and, announce, sound, speed, or, just, speed, when, they, are, ready, the, ad, follows, with, roll, camera, answered, by, speed, by, the, camera, operator, once, the, camera, is, recording, the, clapper, loader, who, is, already, in, front, of, the, camera, with, the, clapperboard, calls, marker, and, slaps, it, shut, if, the, take, involves, extras, or, background, action, the, ad, will, cue, them, action, background, and, last, is, the, director, telling, the, actors, action, the, ad, may, echo, action, louder, on, large, sets, a, take, is, over, when, the, director, calls, cut, and, the, camera, and, sound, stop, recording, the, script, supervisor, will, note, any, continuity, issues, and, the, sound, and, camera, teams, log, technical, notes, for, the, take, on, their, respective, report, sheets, if, the, director, decides, additional, takes, are, required, the, whole, process, repeats, once, satisfied, the, crew, moves, on, to, the, next, camera, angle, or, setup, until, the, whole, scene, is, covered, when, shooting, is, finished, for, the, scene, the, assistant, director, declares, a, wrap, or, moving, on, and, the, crew, will, strike, or, dismantle, the, set, for, that, scene, at, the, end, of, the, day, the, director, approves, the, next, day, s, shooting, schedule, and, a, daily, progress, report, is, sent, to, the, production, office, this, includes, the, report, sheets, from, continuity, sound, and, camera, teams, call, sheets, are, distributed, to, the, cast, and, crew, to, tell, them, when, and, where, to, turn, up, the, next, shooting, day, later, on, the, director, producer, other, department, heads, and, sometimes, the, cast, may, gather, to, watch, that, day, or, yesterday, s, footage, called, dailies, and, review, their, work, with, workdays, often, lasting, fourteen, or, eighteen, hours, in, remote, locations, film, production, tends, to, create, a, team, spirit, when, the, entire, film, is, in, the, can, or, in, the, completion, of, the, production, phase, it, is, customary, for, the, production, office, to, arrange, a, wrap, party, to, thank, all, the, cast, and, crew, for, their, efforts, for, the, production, phase, on, live, action, films, synchronizing, work, schedules, of, key, cast, and, crew, members, is, very, important, for, many, scenes, several, cast, members, and, many, crew, members, must, be, physically, present, at, the, same, place, at, the, same, time, and, bankable, stars, may, need, to, rush, from, one, project, to, another, animated, films, have, different, workflow, at, the, production, phase, in, that, voice, actors, can, record, their, takes, in, the, recording, studio, at, different, times, and, may, not, see, one, another, until, the, film, s, premiere, animated, films, also, have, different, crew, since, most, physical, live, action, tasks, are, either, unnecessary, or, are, simulated, by, various, types, of, animators, this, stage, is, usually, thought, of, as, starting, when, principal, photography, ends, but, they, may, overlap, the, bulk, of, post, production, consists, of, the, film, editor, reviewing, the, footage, with, the, director, and, assembling, the, film, out, of, selected, takes, the, production, sound, dialogue, is, also, edited, music, tracks, and, songs, are, composed, and, recorded, if, a, film, is, intended, to, have, a, score, sound, effects, are, designed, and, recorded, any, computer, generated, visual, effects, are, digitally, added, by, an, artist, finally, all, sound, elements, are, mixed, down, into, stems, which, are, synchronized, to, the, images, on, the, screen, and, the, film, is, fully, completed, locked, distribution, is, the, last, stage, where, the, film, is, released, to, movie, theaters, or, occasionally, directly, to, consumer, media, vhs, vcd, dvd, blu, ray, or, direct, download, from, a, digital, media, provider, the, film, is, duplicated, as, required, either, onto, film, or, hard, disk, drives, and, distributed, to, cinemas, for, exhibition, screening, press, kits, posters, and, other, advertising, materials, are, published, and, the, film, is, advertised, and, promoted, a, b, roll, clip, may, be, released, to, the, press, based, on, raw, footage, shot, for, a, making, of, documentary, which, may, include, making, of, clips, as, well, as, on, set, interviews, separate, from, those, of, the, production, company, or, distributor, for, major, films, key, personnel, are, often, contractually, required, to, participate, in, promotional, tours, in, which, they, appear, at, premieres, and, festivals, and, sit, for, interviews, with, many, tv, print, and, online, journalists, the, largest, productions, may, require, more, than, one, promotional, tour, in, order, to, rejuvenate, audience, demand, at, each, release, window, since, the, advent, of, home, video, in, the, late, 1970s, most, major, films, have, followed, a, pattern, of, having, several, distinct, release, windows, a, film, may, first, be, released, to, a, few, select, cinemas, or, if, it, tests, well, enough, may, go, directly, into, wide, release, next, it, is, released, normally, at, different, times, several, weeks, or, months, apart, into, different, market, segments, like, rental, retail, pay, per, view, in, flight, entertainment, cable, television, satellite, television, or, free, to, air, broadcast, television, the, distribution, rights, for, the, film, are, also, usually, sold, for, worldwide, distribution, the, distributor, and, the, production, company, share, profits, and, manage, losses, filmmaking, also, takes, place, outside, of, the, mainstream, and, is, commonly, called, independent, filmmaking, since, the, introduction, of, dv, technology, the, means, of, production, have, become, more, democratized, and, economically, viable, filmmakers, can, conceivably, shoot, and, edit, a, film, create, and, edit, the, sound, and, music, and, mix, the, final, cut, on, a, home, computer, however, while, the, means, of, production, may, be, democratized, financing, traditional, distribution, and, marketing, remain, difficult, to, accomplish, outside, the, traditional, system, in, the, past, most, independent, filmmakers, have, relied, on, film, festivals, such, as, sundance, film, festival, venice, film, festival, cannes, film, festival, and, toronto, international, film, festivals, to, get, their, films, noticed, and, sold, for, distribution, and, production, however, the, internet, has, allowed, for, the, relatively, inexpensive, distribution, of, independent, films, on, websites, such, as, youtube, as, a, result, several, companies, have, emerged, to, assist, filmmakers, in, getting, independent, movies, seen, and, sold, via, mainstream, internet, marketplaces, often, adjacent, to, popular, hollywood, titles, with, internet, movie, distribution, independent, filmmakers, who, choose, to, forego, a, traditional, distribution, deal, now, have, the, ability, to, reach, global, audiences
