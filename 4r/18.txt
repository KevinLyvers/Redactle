islamic, architecture, comprises, the, architectural, styles, of, buildings, associated, with, islam, it, encompasses, both, secular, and, religious, styles, from, the, early, history, of, islam, to, the, present, day, the, islamic, world, encompasses, a, wide, geographic, area, historically, ranging, from, western, africa, and, europe, to, eastern, asia, certain, commonalities, are, shared, by, islamic, architectural, styles, across, all, these, regions, but, over, time, different, regions, developed, their, own, styles, according, to, local, materials, and, techniques, local, dynasties, and, patrons, different, regional, centers, of, artistic, production, and, sometimes, different, religious, affiliations, early, islamic, architecture, was, influenced, by, roman, byzantine, iranian, and, mesopotamian, architecture, and, all, other, lands, which, the, early, muslim, conquests, conquered, in, the, seventh, and, eighth, centuries, later, it, developed, distinct, characteristics, in, the, form, of, buildings, and, in, the, decoration, of, surfaces, with, islamic, calligraphy, arabesques, and, geometric, motifs, new, architectural, elements, like, minarets, muqarnas, and, multifoil, arches, were, invented, common, or, important, types, of, buildings, in, islamic, architecture, include, mosques, madrasas, tombs, palaces, hammams, public, baths, sufi, hospices, e, g, khanqahs, or, zawiyas, fountains, and, sabils, commercial, buildings, e, g, caravanserais, and, bazaars, and, military, fortifications, the, islamic, era, began, with, the, formation, of, islam, under, the, leadership, of, muhammad, in, early, 7th, century, arabia, the, first, mosque, was, a, structure, built, by, muhammad, in, medina, in, 622, right, after, his, hijrah, migration, from, mecca, which, corresponds, to, the, site, of, the, present, day, mosque, of, the, prophet, al, masjid, an, nabawi, it, is, usually, described, as, his, house, but, may, have, been, designed, to, serve, as, a, community, center, from, the, beginning, it, consisted, of, a, simple, courtyard, structure, built, in, unbaked, brick, with, a, rectangular, almost, square, floor, plan, measuring, about, 53, by, 56, meters, a, shaded, portico, supported, by, palm, trunks, stood, on, the, north, side, of, the, courtyard, in, the, direction, of, prayer, the, qibla, which, was, initially, towards, jerusalem, when, the, qibla, was, changed, to, face, towards, mecca, in, 624, a, similar, portico, was, added, on, the, south, side, facing, towards, that, city, muhammad, and, his, family, lived, in, separate, rooms, attached, to, the, mosque, and, muhammad, himself, was, buried, in, one, of, these, rooms, upon, his, death, in, 632, over, the, rest, of, the, 7th, century, and, in, the, 8th, century, the, mosque, was, repeatedly, expanded, to, include, a, large, flat, roofed, prayer, hall, supported, by, columns, a, hypostyle, hall, with, a, central, courtyard, it, became, one, of, the, main, models, for, the, early, mosques, built, elsewhere, scholars, generally, agree, that, aside, from, muhammad, s, mosque, house, the, architecture, of, the, arabian, peninsula, seems, to, have, had, only, a, limited, role, in, the, formulation, of, later, islamic, architecture, prior, to, the, start, of, the, arab, muslim, conquests, of, the, 7th, century, the, two, major, powers, in, the, middle, east, and, the, eastern, mediterranean, world, were, the, byzantine, eastern, roman, empire, and, the, sasanian, empire, these, two, empires, both, cultivated, their, own, major, architectural, traditions, occupying, the, borderlands, between, these, two, empires, in, the, desert, and, steppe, regions, of, syria, palestine, mesopotamia, and, northern, arabia, were, two, arab, tribal, client, states, the, lakhmids, who, were, clients, of, the, sasanians, and, had, their, capital, at, al, hira, in, present, day, iraq, and, the, ghassanids, who, were, clients, of, the, byzantines, and, protected, their, eastern, borders, these, two, arab, dynasties, were, significant, patrons, of, architecture, in, their, respective, regions, their, architecture, is, not, well, understood, due, to, the, scarcity, of, identifiable, remains, today, but, they, borrowed, and, adapted, the, architecture, of, their, byzantine, and, sasanian, suzerains, some, of, their, buildings, are, known, from, archeology, or, historical, texts, such, as, the, lakhmid, palaces, of, khawarnaq, and, al, sadir, in, al, hira, a, ghassanid, church, with, mosaic, decoration, at, nitil, near, madaba, and, a, ghassanid, audience, hall, incorporated, into, the, later, umayyad, rural, residence, at, ar, rusafa, the, culture, and, architecture, of, the, lakhmids, and, ghassanids, probably, played, a, subsequent, role, in, transmitting, and, filtering, the, architectural, traditions, of, the, sasanian, and, the, byzantine, roman, worlds, to, the, later, arab, islamic, dynasties, who, established, their, political, centers, in, the, same, regions, when, the, early, arab, muslim, conquests, spread, out, from, the, arabian, peninsula, in, the, 7th, century, and, advanced, across, the, middle, east, and, north, africa, new, garrison, cities, were, established, in, the, conquered, territories, such, as, fustat, in, egypt, and, kufa, in, present, day, iraq, the, central, congregational, mosques, of, these, cities, were, built, in, the, hypostyle, format, in, other, cities, especially, in, syria, new, mosques, were, established, by, converting, or, occupying, parts, of, existing, churches, in, existing, cities, as, for, example, in, damascus, and, hama, these, early, mosques, had, no, minaret, although, small, shelters, may, have, been, constructed, on, the, roofs, to, protect, the, muezzin, while, issuing, the, call, to, prayer, the, umayyad, caliphate, 661, 750, combined, elements, of, byzantine, architecture, and, sasanian, architecture, but, umayyad, architecture, introduced, new, combinations, of, these, styles, the, reuse, of, elements, from, classical, roman, and, byzantine, art, was, still, widely, evident, because, political, power, and, patronage, was, centered, in, syria, a, former, roman, byzantine, province, some, former, ghassanid, structures, also, appear, to, have, been, reused, and, modified, during, this, period, however, a, significant, amount, of, experimentation, occurred, as, umayyad, patrons, recruited, craftsmen, from, across, the, empire, and, architects, were, allowed, or, even, encouraged, to, mix, elements, from, different, artistic, traditions, and, to, disregard, traditional, conventions, and, restraints, partly, as, a, result, of, this, umayyad, architecture, is, distinguished, by, the, extent, and, variety, of, decoration, including, mosaics, wall, painting, sculpture, and, carved, reliefs, while, figural, scenes, were, notably, present, in, monuments, like, qusayr, amra, non, figural, decoration, and, more, abstract, scenes, became, highly, favoured, especially, in, religious, architecture, the, umayyad, period, thus, played, a, crucial, role, in, transforming, and, enriching, existing, architectural, traditions, during, the, formation, of, early, islamic, society, s, visual, culture, the, umayyads, were, the, first, to, add, the, mihrab, to, mosque, design, a, concave, niche, in, the, qibla, wall, of, the, mosque, the, first, mihrab, reportedly, appeared, at, muhammad, s, mosque, in, medina, when, it, was, rebuilt, by, al, walid, i, in, 707, it, seems, to, have, represented, the, place, where, the, prophet, stood, when, leading, prayer, this, almost, immediately, became, a, standard, feature, of, all, mosques, several, major, early, monuments, of, islamic, architecture, built, under, the, umayyads, include, the, dome, of, the, rock, in, jerusalem, built, by, caliph, abd, al, malik, and, the, great, mosque, of, damascus, built, by, al, walid, i, the, al, aqsa, mosque, on, the, al, aqsa, compound, also, in, jerusalem, was, also, rebuilt, by, al, walid, i, replacing, an, earlier, simple, structure, built, around, 670, a, number, of, palaces, from, this, period, have, also, partially, survived, or, have, been, excavated, in, modern, times, the, horseshoe, arch, appears, for, the, first, time, in, umayyad, architecture, later, to, evolve, to, its, most, advanced, form, in, al, andalus, iberian, peninsula, the, dome, of, the, rock, has, a, centralized, floor, plan, with, an, octagonal, layout, this, was, most, likely, modeled, on, earlier, byzantine, martyria, in, the, region, that, had, a, similar, form, such, as, the, church, of, the, kathisma, despite, the, religious, and, historical, importance, of, the, dome, of, the, rock, its, layout, did, not, frequently, serve, as, a, model, for, major, islamic, monuments, after, it, in, hypostyle, mosques, the, umayyads, introduced, the, tradition, of, making, the, nave, or, aisle, in, front, of, the, mihrab, wider, than, the, others, dividing, the, prayer, room, along, its, central, axis, this, innovation, was, probably, inspired, by, the, layout, of, existing, christian, basilicas, in, the, region, both, the, al, aqsa, mosque, and, the, great, mosque, of, damascus, feature, a, hypostyle, hall, in, this, fashion, with, a, dome, above, the, space, in, front, of, the, mihrab, and, both, were, influential, in, the, design, of, later, mosques, elsewhere, the, dome, of, the, rock, and, the, umayyad, mosque, are, also, notable, for, their, extensive, program, of, mosaic, decoration, that, drew, on, late, antique, motifs, and, craftsmanship, however, mosaic, decoration, eventually, fell, out, of, fashion, in, islamic, architecture, the, abbasid, architecture, of, the, abbasid, caliphate, 750, 1513, was, particularly, influenced, by, sasanian, architecture, which, in, turn, featured, elements, present, since, ancient, mesopotamia, other, influences, such, as, ancient, soghdian, architecture, in, central, asia, have, also, been, noted, this, was, partly, a, result, of, the, caliphate, s, political, center, shifting, further, east, to, the, new, capital, of, baghdad, in, present, day, iraq, the, abbasids, also, built, other, capital, cities, such, as, samarra, in, the, 9th, century, which, is, now, a, major, archeological, site, that, has, provided, numerous, insights, into, the, evolution, of, islamic, art, and, architecture, during, this, time, during, the, abbasid, caliphate, s, golden, years, in, the, 8th, and, 9th, centuries, its, great, power, and, unity, allowed, architectural, fashions, and, innovations, to, spread, quickly, to, other, areas, of, the, islamic, world, under, its, influence, features, from, the, late, umayyad, period, such, as, vaulting, carved, stucco, and, painted, wall, decoration, were, continued, and, elaborated, in, the, abbasid, period, the, four, centred, arch, a, more, sophisticated, form, of, the, pointed, arch, is, first, attested, during, the, abbasid, period, in, monuments, at, samarra, such, as, the, qasr, al, ashiq, palace, and, became, widely, used, in, some, regions, at, later, periods, samarra, also, saw, the, appearance, of, new, decorative, styles, particularly, in, stucco, and, plasterwork, which, rendered, the, earlier, vegetal, motifs, of, late, antique, traditions, into, more, abstract, and, stylized, forms, as, exemplified, by, the, so, called, beveled, style, these, decorative, techniques, quickly, spread, to, other, regions, where, stucco, decoration, played, a, prominent, role, abbasid, mosques, all, followed, the, courtyard, plan, with, hypostyle, halls, the, earliest, was, the, mosque, that, caliph, al, mansur, built, in, baghdad, since, destroyed, the, great, mosque, of, samarra, built, by, al, mutawakkil, measured, 256, by, 139, metres, 840, by, 456, ft, had, a, flat, wooden, roof, supported, by, columns, and, was, decorated, with, marble, panels, and, glass, mosaics, the, prayer, hall, of, the, abu, dulaf, mosque, at, samarra, had, arcades, on, rectangular, brick, piers, running, at, right, angles, to, the, qibla, wall, both, of, the, samarra, mosques, have, spiral, minarets, the, only, examples, in, iraq, a, mosque, at, balkh, in, what, is, now, afghanistan, was, about, 20, by, 20, metres, 66, by, 66, ft, square, with, three, rows, of, three, square, bays, supporting, nine, vaulted, domes, while, the, origins, of, the, minaret, are, uncertain, it, is, believed, that, the, first, true, minarets, appeared, in, this, period, several, of, the, abbasid, mosques, built, in, the, early, ninth, century, had, minaret, towers, which, stood, at, the, northern, ends, of, the, building, opposite, the, central, mihrab, among, the, most, famous, of, these, is, the, malwiyya, minaret, a, stand, alone, tower, with, a, spiral, form, built, for, the, great, mosque, of, samarra, after, the, overthrow, of, the, umayyad, caliphate, in, 750, by, the, abbasids, a, new, branch, of, the, umayyad, dynasty, succeeded, in, taking, control, of, al, andalus, in, 756, creating, the, emirate, of, c, rdoba, and, reaching, the, apogee, of, its, power, during, the, caliphate, of, c, rdoba, in, the, 10th, century, the, great, mosque, of, c, rdoba, built, in, 785, 786, marks, the, earliest, major, monument, of, moorish, architecture, in, the, iberian, peninsula, al, andalus, this, style, of, architecture, established, in, al, andalus, was, also, largely, shared, with, the, architecture, of, western, north, africa, the, maghreb, from, which, later, empires, in, the, region, would, also, emerge, and, contribute, to, its, artistic, evolution, the, original, great, mosque, of, cordoba, was, noted, for, its, unique, hypostyle, hall, with, rows, of, double, tiered, two, coloured, arches, which, were, repeated, and, maintained, in, later, extensions, of, the, building, the, mosque, was, expanded, multiple, times, with, the, expansion, by, al, hakam, ii, r, 961, 976, introducing, important, aesthetic, innovations, such, as, interlacing, arches, and, ribbed, domes, which, were, imitated, and, elaborated, in, later, monuments, in, the, region, the, construction, of, madinat, al, zahra, a, new, capital, and, monumental, palace, city, in, the, 10th, century, also, created, an, important, complex, of, royal, architecture, and, patronage, smaller, monuments, such, as, the, bab, al, mardum, mosque, in, toledo, and, the, minarets, added, to, the, qarawiyyin, and, andalusiyyin, mosques, in, fez, present, day, morocco, demonstrate, the, prevalence, of, the, same, stylistic, elements, across, the, region, after, its, initial, apogee, of, power, the, abbasid, caliphate, became, partly, fragmented, into, regional, states, in, the, 9th, century, which, were, formally, obedient, to, the, caliphs, in, baghdad, but, were, de, facto, independent, the, aghlabids, in, ifriqiya, roughly, modern, day, tunisia, were, notable, patrons, of, architecture, themselves, responsible, for, rebuilding, both, the, great, mosque, of, kairouan, originally, founded, by, uqba, ibn, nafi, in, 670, and, the, zaytuna, mosque, of, tunis, in, much, of, their, current, forms, as, well, as, for, building, numerous, other, structures, in, the, region, in, egypt, ahmad, ibn, tulun, established, a, short, lived, dynasty, the, tulunids, and, built, himself, a, new, capital, al, qata, i, and, a, new, congregational, mosque, known, as, the, ibn, tulun, mosque, which, was, completed, in, 879, it, was, strongly, influenced, by, abbasid, architecture, in, samarra, and, remains, one, of, the, most, notable, and, best, preserved, examples, of, 9th, century, architecture, from, the, abbasid, caliphate, in, iran, and, central, asia, a, number, of, other, local, and, regional, dynasties, held, sway, prior, to, the, arrival, of, the, seljuks, in, the, 11th, century, by, the, 10th, century, central, iran, and, the, abbasid, heartland, of, iraq, were, under, the, de, facto, rule, of, the, buyid, dynasty, northern, iran, was, ruled, by, the, bawandids, and, ziyarids, and, the, northeastern, regions, of, khurasan, and, transoxiana, were, ruled, by, the, samanids, it, is, around, this, period, that, many, of, the, distinctive, features, of, subsequent, iranian, and, central, asian, architecture, first, emerged, including, the, use, of, baked, brick, for, both, construction, and, decoration, the, use, of, glazed, tile, for, surface, decoration, and, the, development, of, muqarnas, from, squinches, hypostyle, mosques, continued, to, be, built, and, there, is, also, evidence, of, multi, domed, mosques, though, most, were, modified, or, rebuilt, in, later, eras, the, jameh, mosque, of, na, in, one, of, the, oldest, surviving, congregational, mosques, in, iran, contains, some, of, the, best, preserved, features, from, this, period, including, decorative, brickwork, kufic, inscriptions, and, rich, stucco, decoration, featuring, vine, scrolls, and, acanthus, leaves, that, draw, from, the, earlier, styles, of, samarra, another, important, architectural, trend, to, arise, in, the, 10th, to, 11th, centuries, is, the, development, of, mausolea, which, took, on, monumental, forms, for, the, first, time, one, type, of, mausoleum, was, the, tomb, tower, such, as, the, gunbad, i, qabus, circa, 1006, 7, while, the, other, main, type, was, the, domed, square, such, as, the, tomb, of, the, samanids, in, bukhara, before, 943, in, the, 10th, century, the, fatimid, caliphate, rose, to, power, in, ifriqiya, where, it, built, a, new, fortified, capital, at, mahdia, in, 970, the, fatimids, moved, their, center, of, power, to, egypt, and, founded, another, capital, cairo, fatimid, architecture, in, egypt, followed, tulunid, techniques, and, used, similar, materials, but, also, developed, its, own, features, the, first, fatimid, congregational, mosque, in, cairo, was, al, azhar, mosque, founded, at, the, same, time, as, the, city, 970, which, became, the, spiritual, center, for, the, ismaili, shi, a, branch, of, islam, other, notable, monuments, include, the, large, mosque, of, al, hakim, founded, in, 990, under, al, aziz, but, completed, around, 1013, under, al, hakim, the, small, aqmar, mosque, 1125, with, its, richly, decorated, street, fa, ade, and, the, domed, mashhad, of, sayyida, ruqayya, 1133, notable, for, its, mihrab, of, elaborately, carved, stucco, under, the, powerful, vizier, badr, al, jamali, r, 1073, 1094, the, city, walls, were, rebuilt, in, stone, along, with, several, monumental, gates, three, of, which, have, survived, to, the, present, day, bab, al, futuh, bab, al, nasr, and, bab, zuweila, in, the, architecture, of, the, muslim, world, courtyards, are, found, in, secular, and, religious, structures, a, hypostyle, i, e, an, open, hall, supported, by, columns, is, considered, to, be, derived, from, architectural, traditions, of, achaemenid, period, persian, assembly, halls, apadana, this, type, of, building, originated, from, the, roman, style, basilica, with, an, adjacent, courtyard, surrounded, by, colonnades, like, trajan, s, forum, in, rome, the, roman, type, of, building, has, developed, out, of, the, greek, agora, in, islamic, architecture, the, hypostyle, hall, is, the, main, feature, of, the, hypostyle, mosque, one, of, the, earliest, hypostyle, mosques, is, the, tarikhaneh, mosque, in, iran, dating, back, to, the, eighth, century, some, scholars, refer, to, the, early, hypostyle, mosque, with, courtyard, as, the, arab, plan, or, arab, type, mosque, such, mosques, were, constructed, mostly, under, the, umayyad, and, abbasid, dynasties, subsequently, however, the, simplicity, of, this, type, of, plan, limited, the, opportunities, for, further, development, and, as, a, result, these, mosques, gradually, fell, out, of, popularity, in, some, regions, in, islamic, buildings, vaulting, follows, two, distinct, architectural, styles, while, umayyad, architecture, in, the, west, continues, syrian, traditions, of, the, sixth, and, seventh, century, eastern, islamic, architecture, was, mainly, influenced, by, sasanian, styles, and, forms, in, their, vaulting, structures, umayyad, period, buildings, show, a, mixture, of, ancient, roman, and, persian, architectural, traditions, diaphragm, arches, with, lintelled, ceilings, made, of, wood, or, stone, beams, or, alternatively, with, barrel, vaults, were, known, in, the, levant, since, the, classical, and, nabatean, period, they, were, mainly, used, to, cover, houses, and, cisterns, the, architectural, form, of, covering, diaphragm, arches, with, barrel, vaults, however, was, likely, newly, introduced, from, iranian, architecture, as, similar, vaulting, was, not, known, in, bilad, al, sham, before, the, arrival, of, the, umayyads, however, this, form, was, well, known, in, iran, from, early, parthian, times, as, exemplified, in, the, parthian, buildings, of, a, ur, the, earliest, known, example, for, barrel, vaults, resting, on, diaphragm, arches, from, umayyad, architecture, is, known, from, qasr, harane, in, syria, during, the, early, period, the, diaphragm, arches, are, built, from, coarsely, cut, limestone, slabs, without, using, supporting, falsework, which, were, connected, by, gypsum, mortar, later, period, vaults, were, erected, using, pre, formed, lateral, ribs, modelled, from, gypsum, which, served, as, a, temporal, formwork, to, guide, and, center, the, vault, these, ribs, which, were, left, in, the, structure, afterwards, do, not, carry, any, load, the, ribs, were, cast, in, advance, on, strips, of, cloth, the, impression, of, which, can, still, be, seen, in, the, ribs, today, similar, structures, are, known, from, sasanian, architecture, for, example, from, the, palace, of, firuzabad, umayyad, period, vaults, of, this, type, were, found, in, amman, citadel, and, in, qasr, amra, an, iwan, is, a, hall, that, is, walled, on, three, sides, and, open, on, one, side, it, is, typically, covered, by, a, vault, although, this, can, vary, this, feature, was, present, in, sasanian, architecture, though, its, exact, origins, are, older, and, still, debated, it, was, later, incorporated, into, islamic, architecture, its, usage, became, more, common, and, widespread, under, the, seljuks, in, the, 10th, century, iwans, were, used, in, a, variety, of, ways, and, arranged, in, varying, positions, in, relation, to, the, rest, of, the, building, they, are, found, in, many, types, of, buildings, including, mosques, madrasas, palaces, and, caravanserais, a, common, layout, is, the, four, iwan, plan, the, related, persian, term, pishtaq, means, the, entrance, portal, sometimes, an, iwan, projecting, from, the, fa, ade, of, a, building, often, decorated, with, calligraphy, bands, glazed, tilework, and, geometric, designs, because, of, its, long, history, of, building, and, re, building, spanning, the, time, from, the, abbasids, to, the, qajar, dynasty, and, its, excellent, state, of, conservation, the, jameh, mosque, of, isfahan, provides, an, overview, over, the, experiments, islamic, architects, conducted, with, complicated, vaulting, structures, the, system, of, squinches, which, is, a, construction, filling, in, the, upper, angles, of, a, square, room, so, as, to, form, a, base, to, receive, an, octagonal, or, spherical, dome, was, already, known, in, sasanian, architecture, the, spherical, triangles, of, the, squinches, were, split, up, into, further, subdivisions, or, systems, of, niches, resulting, in, a, complex, interplay, of, supporting, structures, forming, an, ornamental, spatial, pattern, which, hides, the, weight, of, the, structure, the, tradition, of, double, shelled, brick, domes, in, iran, has, been, traced, back, to, the, 11th, century, at, the, beginning, of, the, 15th, century, major, timurid, monuments, like, the, gur, i, amir, mausoleum, and, the, bibi, khanum, mosque, both, completed, around, 1404, were, notable, in, their, use, of, large, double, shelled, domes, these, domes, were, composed, of, an, inner, shell, which, was, visible, from, the, interior, and, a, larger, outer, shell, visible, from, the, exterior, and, often, of, a, slightly, different, shape, the, gur, i, amir, mausoleum, s, dome, the, oldest, one, to, have, survived, to, the, present, day, features, an, exterior, ribbed, profile, with, a, band, of, muqarnas, around, its, drum, however, domes, of, this, shape, and, style, were, likely, constructed, earlier, as, evidenced, by, the, sultaniyya, mausoleum, in, cairo, which, was, built, earlier, in, the, 1350s, and, appears, to, have, copied, this, same, design, from, the, iranian, tradition, the, non, radial, rib, vault, an, architectural, form, of, ribbed, vaults, with, a, superimposed, spherical, dome, is, the, characteristic, architectural, vault, form, of, the, islamic, east, from, its, beginnings, in, the, jameh, mosque, of, isfahan, this, form, of, vault, was, used, in, a, sequence, of, important, buildings, up, to, the, period, of, safavid, architecture, its, main, characteristics, are, while, intersecting, pairs, of, ribs, from, the, main, decorative, feature, of, seljuk, architecture, the, ribs, were, hidden, behind, additional, architectural, elements, in, later, periods, as, exemplified, in, the, dome, of, the, tomb, of, ahmed, sanjar, in, merv, until, they, finally, disappeared, completely, behind, the, double, shell, of, a, stucco, dome, as, seen, in, the, dome, of, l, q, p, in, isfahan, the, use, of, domes, in, south, asia, started, with, the, establishment, of, delhi, sultanate, in, 1204, ce, unlike, ottoman, domes, and, even, more, so, than, persian, domes, domes, in, south, asia, tend, to, be, more, bulbous, many, monumental, mughal, domes, were, also, double, shelled, and, derived, from, the, iranian, tradition, the, design, of, the, tomb, of, humayun, completed, around, 1571, 72, including, its, double, shelled, dome, suggests, that, its, architects, were, familiar, with, timurid, monuments, in, samarqand, the, central, dome, of, the, taj, mahal, likewise, features, a, bulbous, profile, and, a, double, shelled, construction, the, great, mosque, of, c, rdoba, in, al, andalus, was, initially, built, with, a, system, of, double, arched, arcades, supporting, the, flat, timberwork, ceiling, the, columns, of, the, arcades, are, connected, by, horseshoe, arches, which, support, brick, pillars, which, are, in, turn, interconnected, by, semicircular, arches, 40, 42, this, arcade, system, was, copied, during, the, mosque, s, subsequent, expansions, but, the, expansion, by, al, hakam, ii, after, 961, also, introduced, a, series, of, ornate, ribbed, domes, three, domes, span, the, vaults, in, front, of, the, mihrab, wall, while, another, one, covers, an, area, now, known, by, its, spanish, name, the, capilla, de, villaviciosa, located, several, bays, before, the, mihrab, in, sections, which, now, supporting, these, domes, additional, supporting, structures, were, needed, to, bear, the, thrust, of, the, cupolas, the, architects, solved, this, problem, by, the, construction, of, intersecting, arches, the, domes, themselves, are, built, with, eight, intersecting, stone, ribs, rather, than, meeting, in, the, centre, of, the, dome, the, ribs, intersect, one, another, off, center, leaving, the, central, space, to, be, occupied, by, a, smaller, cupola, for, the, domes, in, front, of, the, mihrab, the, ribs, form, an, eight, pointed, star, and, an, octagonal, cupola, in, the, centre, for, the, dome, over, the, capilla, de, villaviciosa, the, ribs, leave, a, central, square, space, between, them, with, an, octagonal, cupola, added, over, this, the, ribbed, domes, of, the, mosque, cathedral, of, c, rdoba, served, as, models, for, later, mosque, buildings, in, the, islamic, west, of, al, andalus, and, the, maghreb, at, around, 1000, ad, the, bab, al, mardum, mosque, in, toledo, was, constructed, with, a, similar, eight, ribbed, dome, surrounded, by, eight, other, ribbed, domes, of, varying, design, similar, domes, are, also, seen, in, the, mosque, building, of, the, aljafer, a, of, zaragoza, the, architectural, form, of, the, ribbed, dome, was, further, developed, in, the, maghreb, the, central, dome, of, the, great, mosque, of, tlemcen, a, masterpiece, of, the, almoravids, founded, in, 1082, has, twelve, slender, ribs, the, shell, between, the, ribs, is, filled, with, filigree, stucco, work, based, on, the, model, of, pre, existing, byzantine, domes, ottoman, architecture, developed, a, specific, form, of, monumental, representative, building, wide, central, domes, with, huge, diameters, were, erected, on, top, of, a, centre, plan, building, despite, their, enormous, weight, the, domes, appear, virtually, weightless, some, of, the, most, elaborate, domed, buildings, have, been, constructed, by, the, ottoman, architect, mimar, sinan, when, the, ottomans, had, conquered, constantinople, they, found, a, variety, of, byzantine, christian, churches, the, largest, and, most, prominent, amongst, them, was, the, hagia, sophia, the, brickwork, and, mortar, ribs, and, the, spherical, shell, of, the, central, dome, of, the, hagia, sophia, were, built, simultaneously, as, a, self, supporting, structure, without, any, wooden, centring, in, the, early, byzantine, church, of, hagia, irene, the, ribs, of, the, dome, vault, are, fully, integrated, into, the, shell, similar, to, western, roman, domes, and, thus, are, not, visible, from, within, the, building, in, the, dome, of, the, hagia, sophia, the, ribs, and, shell, of, the, dome, unite, in, a, central, medallion, at, the, apex, of, the, dome, the, upper, ends, of, the, ribs, being, integrated, into, the, shell, shell, and, ribs, form, one, single, structural, entity, in, later, byzantine, buildings, like, the, kalenderhane, mosque, the, eski, imaret, mosque, formerly, the, monastery, of, christ, pantepoptes, or, the, pantokrator, monastery, today, zeyrek, mosque, the, central, medallion, of, the, apex, and, the, ribs, of, the, dome, became, separate, structural, elements, the, ribs, are, more, pronounced, and, connect, to, the, central, medallion, which, also, stands, out, more, pronouncedly, so, that, the, entire, construction, gives, the, impression, as, if, ribs, and, medallion, are, separate, from, and, underpin, the, proper, shell, of, the, dome, elaborately, decorated, ceilings, and, dome, interiors, draw, influence, from, near, eastern, and, mediterranean, architectural, decoration, while, also, serving, as, explicit, and, symbolic, representations, of, the, heavens, these, dome, shaped, architectural, features, could, be, seen, at, the, early, islamic, palaces, such, as, qusayr, amra, c, 712, 15, and, khirbat, al, mafjar, c, 724, 43, mimar, sinan, solved, the, structural, issues, of, the, hagia, sophia, dome, by, constructing, a, system, of, centrally, symmetric, pillars, with, flanking, semi, domes, as, exemplified, by, the, design, of, the, s, leymaniye, mosque, four, pillars, with, two, flanking, shield, walls, and, two, semi, domes, 1550, 1557, the, r, stem, pasha, mosque, eight, pillars, with, four, diagonal, semi, domes, 1561, 1563, and, the, selimiye, mosque, in, edirne, eight, pillars, with, four, diagonal, semi, domes, 1567, 8, 1574, 5, in, the, history, of, architecture, the, structure, of, the, selimiye, mosque, has, no, precedent, all, elements, of, the, building, are, subordinate, to, its, great, dome, gardens, and, water, have, for, many, centuries, played, an, essential, role, in, islamic, culture, and, are, often, compared, to, the, garden, of, paradise, the, comparison, originates, from, the, achaemenid, empire, in, his, dialogue, oeconomicus, xenophon, has, socrates, relate, the, story, of, the, spartan, general, lysander, s, visit, to, the, persian, prince, cyrus, the, younger, who, shows, the, greek, his, paradise, at, sardis, the, classical, form, of, the, persian, paradise, garden, or, the, charbagh, comprises, a, rectangular, irrigated, space, with, elevated, pathways, which, divide, the, garden, into, four, sections, of, equal, size, one, of, the, hallmarks, of, persian, gardens, is, the, four, part, garden, laid, out, with, axial, paths, that, intersect, at, the, garden, s, centre, this, highly, structured, geometrical, scheme, called, the, chahar, bagh, became, a, powerful, metaphor, for, the, organization, and, domestication, of, the, landscape, itself, a, symbol, of, political, territory, a, charbagh, from, achaemenid, time, has, been, identified, in, the, archaeological, excavations, at, pasargadae, the, gardens, of, chehel, sotoun, isfahan, fin, garden, kashan, eram, garden, shiraz, shazdeh, garden, mahan, dowlatabad, garden, yazd, abbasabad, garden, abbasabad, akbarieh, garden, south, khorasan, province, pahlevanpour, garden, all, in, iran, form, part, of, the, unesco, world, heritage, large, paradise, gardens, are, also, found, at, the, taj, mahal, agra, and, at, humayun, s, tomb, new, delhi, in, india, the, shalimar, gardens, lahore, pakistan, or, at, the, alhambra, and, generalife, in, granada, spain, as, a, common, feature, islamic, architecture, makes, use, of, specific, ornamental, forms, including, mathematically, complicated, elaborate, geometric, patterns, floral, motifs, like, the, arabesque, and, elaborate, calligraphic, inscriptions, the, geometric, or, floral, interlaced, forms, taken, together, constitute, an, infinitely, repeated, pattern, that, extends, beyond, the, visible, material, world, figural, motifs, such, as, animals, humans, and, imaginary, creatures, have, a, rich, tradition, in, islamic, art, though, they, generally, more, stylized, than, naturalistic, however, because, of, the, religious, taboo, on, figural, representations, non, figural, decoration, remained, more, dominant, overall, and, figural, motifs, were, generally, excluded, from, religious, buildings, entirely, the, importance, of, the, written, word, in, islam, ensured, that, epigraphic, or, calligraphic, decoration, played, a, prominent, role, in, architecture, epigraphic, decoration, can, also, indicate, further, political, or, religious, messages, through, the, selection, of, a, textual, program, of, inscriptions, for, example, the, calligraphic, inscriptions, adorning, the, dome, of, the, rock, include, quotations, from, the, qur, an, that, reference, the, miracle, of, jesus, and, his, human, nature, e, g, quran, 19, 33, 35, the, oneness, of, god, e, g, qur, an, 112, and, the, role, of, muhammad, as, the, seal, of, the, prophets, which, have, been, interpreted, as, an, attempt, to, announce, the, rejection, of, the, christian, concept, of, the, holy, trinity, and, to, proclaim, the, triumph, of, islam, over, christianity, and, judaism, additionally, foundation, inscriptions, on, buildings, commonly, indicate, its, founder, or, patron, the, date, of, its, construction, the, name, of, the, reigning, sovereign, and, other, information, these, decorative, motifs, are, expressed, in, a, range, of, mediums, including, stone, carving, brickwork, carved, stucco, tilework, paint, glass, mosaics, marble, or, stone, paneling, and, stained, glass, windows, capitals, the, upper, part, or, crowing, feature, of, a, column, serve, as, a, transition, piece, and, are, often, decoratively, carved, they, range, greatly, in, design, and, shape, in, islamic, architecture, early, islamic, buildings, in, iran, featured, persian, type, capitals, which, included, designs, of, bulls, heads, while, mediterranean, structures, displayed, a, more, classical, influence, muqarnas, is, a, three, dimensional, sculpted, motif, created, by, the, geometric, subdivision, of, a, vaulting, structure, into, miniature, superimposed, pointed, arch, substructures, or, niches, also, known, as, honeycomb, or, stalactite, vaults, they, can, be, made, from, different, materials, like, stone, brick, wood, or, stucco, the, earliest, monuments, to, make, use, of, this, feature, date, from, the, 11th, century, and, are, found, in, iraq, north, africa, iran, central, asia, and, upper, egypt, this, apparently, near, simultaneous, development, in, distant, regions, of, the, islamic, world, has, led, to, multiple, scholarly, theories, about, their, origin, and, spread, with, one, current, theory, proposing, that, they, originated, in, one, region, at, least, a, century, earlier, and, then, spread, from, there, some, of, the, earliest, surviving, examples, preserved, in, situ, are, tripartite, squinches, used, as, transitional, elements, for, domes, and, semi, domes, such, as, at, the, arab, ata, mausoleum, 977, 978, in, tim, uzbekistan, the, gunbad, i, qabus, 1006, 1007, in, northeastern, iran, and, the, duvazdah, imam, mausoleum, 1037, 1038, in, yazd, from, the, 12th, century, onward, its, usage, became, common, across, the, islamic, world, and, different, local, styles, developed, over, time, in, addition, to, serving, as, squinches, and, pendentives, muqarnas, was, also, employed, to, decorate, cornices, portals, mihrabs, windows, arches, and, entire, domes, balconies, are, a, common, feature, of, islamic, domestic, architecture, due, to, the, warm, climates, in, most, countries, one, of, the, mosque, recognizable, types, is, the, mashrabiya, a, wooden, lattice, screen, which, projects, from, the, side, of, a, building, and, which, protected, privacy, by, allowed, those, inside, to, look, outside, without, being, visible, from, outside, another, type, of, lattice, screen, not, restricted, to, balconies, is, the, jali, which, is, common, to, indo, islamic, architecture, and, is, made, of, perforated, stone, other, examples, of, balconies, and, related, structures, include, the, jharokha, in, rajasthani, and, indo, islamic, architecture, and, the, mirador, a, spanish, term, applied, to, a, balcony, or, lookout, pavilion, in, andalusi, palaces, like, the, alhambra, balconies, also, became, an, architectural, element, inside, some, mosques, such, as, the, h, nk, r, mahfili, in, ottoman, mosques, a, separate, and, protected, space, where, the, sultan, could, perform, his, prayers, similar, to, a, maqsura, a, similar, feature, is, also, found, in, the, bara, gunbad, complex, late, 15th, century, in, delhi, the, qiblah, is, the, direction, in, which, mecca, is, from, any, given, location, towards, which, muslims, face, during, prayers, within, islamic, architecture, it, is, a, major, component, of, both, the, features, and, the, orientation, of, the, building, itself, mosques, and, religious, structures, are, built, to, have, one, side, aligned, with, this, direction, usually, marked, by, a, visual, feature, called, a, mihrab, the, layout, of, some, muslim, cities, may, have, also, been, influenced, by, this, orientation, in, practice, however, the, qibla, alignments, of, mosques, built, in, different, periods, and, locations, do, not, all, point, to, the, same, place, this, is, due, to, discrepancies, in, the, calculations, of, the, islamic, scientists, in, the, past, who, determined, where, mecca, was, from, their, individual, locations, scholars, note, that, these, differences, come, about, for, a, multitude, of, reasons, such, as, some, misunderstanding, the, meaning, of, qibla, itself, the, fact, that, the, geographic, coordinates, of, the, past, do, not, line, up, with, the, coordinates, of, today, and, that, the, determination, of, this, direction, was, more, an, astronomical, calculation, rather, than, a, mathematical, one, early, mosques, were, constructed, according, to, either, the, calculations, of, what, direction, qibla, was, approximately, or, with, the, mihrab, facing, south, as, that, was, the, direction, that, muhammad, was, facing, when, he, prayed, in, medina, which, is, a, city, directly, north, of, mecca, the, mihrab, is, a, niche, or, alcove, typically, concave, set, into, the, qibla, wall, the, wall, standing, in, the, direction, of, prayer, of, a, mosque, or, other, prayer, space, it, symbolized, and, indicated, the, direction, of, the, qibla, to, worshippers, it, also, acquired, ritual, and, ceremonial, importance, over, time, and, its, shape, was, even, used, as, a, symbol, on, some, coinage, the, very, first, mosques, did, not, have, mihrabs, the, first, known, concave, mihrab, niche, was, the, one, added, to, the, prophet, s, mosque, in, medina, by, caliph, al, walid, i, in, 706, or, 707, in, later, mosques, the, mihrab, evolved, to, become, the, usual, focus, of, architectural, decoration, in, the, building, the, details, of, its, shape, and, materials, varied, from, region, to, region, in, congregational, mosques, the, mihrab, was, usually, flanked, by, a, minbar, pulpit, and, some, historical, mosques, also, included, a, nearby, maqsura, a, protected, space, for, the, ruler, during, prayers, the, minaret, is, a, tower, that, traditionally, accompanies, a, mosque, building, its, formal, function, is, to, provide, a, vantage, point, from, which, the, call, to, prayer, or, adh, n, is, made, the, call, to, prayer, is, issued, five, times, each, day, dawn, noon, mid, afternoon, sunset, and, night, in, most, modern, mosques, the, adh, n, is, made, directly, from, the, prayer, hall, and, broadcast, via, microphone, to, a, speaker, system, on, the, minaret, the, origin, of, the, minaret, and, its, initial, functions, are, not, clearly, known, and, have, long, been, a, topic, of, scholarly, discussion, the, earliest, mosques, lacked, minarets, and, the, call, to, prayer, was, often, performed, from, smaller, tower, structures, the, early, muslim, community, of, medina, gave, the, call, to, prayer, from, the, doorway, or, the, roof, of, the, house, of, muhammad, which, doubled, as, a, place, for, prayer, the, first, confirmed, minarets, in, the, form, of, towers, date, from, the, early, 9th, century, under, abbasid, rule, and, they, did, not, become, a, standard, feature, of, mosques, until, the, 11th, century, these, first, minaret, towers, were, placed, in, the, middle, of, the, wall, opposite, the, qibla, wall, among, them, the, minaret, of, the, great, mosque, of, kairouan, in, tunisia, dating, from, 836, is, one, of, the, oldest, surviving, minarets, in, the, world, and, the, oldest, in, north, africa, it, has, the, shape, of, a, massive, tower, with, a, square, base, three, levels, of, decreasing, widths, and, a, total, height, of, 31, 5, meters, minarets, have, had, various, forms, in, general, round, squared, spiral, or, octagonal, depending, on, the, period, and, architectural, tradition, the, number, of, minarets, by, mosques, is, not, fixed, originally, one, minaret, would, accompany, each, mosque, but, some, architectural, styles, can, include, multiple, minarets, in, the, newly, conquered, areas, of, the, early, muslim, expansion, military, settlements, were, often, founded, known, individually, as, a, misr, arabic, pl, am, r, this, policy, continued, up, to, the, umayyad, period, like, frontier, colonies, these, towns, served, as, bases, for, further, conquests, initially, they, appear, to, have, been, modest, settlements, consisting, of, an, agglomeration, of, tents, perhaps, similar, to, ancient, roman, legionary, camps, they, were, established, outside, existing, non, muslim, cities, they, were, often, unfortified, and, the, residents, were, organized, according, to, tribal, origins, rather, than, maintaining, their, original, purpose, to, serve, as, a, military, base, many, am, r, developed, into, urbanized, administrative, and, commercial, centers, in, particular, this, happened, in, the, case, of, the, iraqi, cities, of, kufa, and, basra, which, became, known, as, al, mi, r, n, the, two, forts, as, well, as, fustat, and, kairouan, in, north, africa, basic, facilities, like, a, mosque, a, governor, s, residence, d, r, al, im, ra, and, a, market, were, likely, the, first, major, constructions, to, appear, located, at, the, center, of, the, town, more, often, than, founding, new, cities, the, new, islamic, rulers, took, over, existing, towns, most, of, the, new, arab, settlers, nonetheless, settled, into, previously, existing, urban, centers, throughout, the, conquered, territories, these, cities, were, transformed, according, to, the, needs, of, the, new, islamic, society, and, islamic, facilities, were, inserted, into, the, existing, urban, fabric, after, the, conquest, in, the, case, of, damascus, and, aleppo, for, example, the, cities, were, largely, of, roman, byzantine, heritage, and, their, topography, changed, slowly, the, islamic, presence, was, signaled, at, first, only, by, the, presence, of, a, mosque, and, in, damascus, the, royal, palace, this, transformation, which, resulted, in, what, is, often, regarded, as, the, traditional, islamic, city, occurred, over, a, long, period, and, was, shaped, by, multiple, social, and, economic, causes, that, varied, according, to, region, and, period, the, arrival, of, islamic, rule, was, only, one, stage, in, a, process, that, had, already, begun, by, the, 6th, century, the, principle, of, arranging, buildings, is, known, as, horizontal, spread, residencies, and, public, buildings, as, well, as, private, housing, tend, to, be, laid, out, separately, and, are, not, directly, related, to, each, other, architectonically, archaeological, excavations, at, the, city, of, jerash, the, gerasa, of, antiquity, have, revealed, how, the, umayyads, have, transformed, the, city, plan, the, antique, concept, of, the, architecture, of, a, metropolis, is, based, on, a, structure, of, main, and, smaller, roads, running, through, the, entire, city, and, dividing, it, into, quarters, the, streets, are, oriented, towards, public, buildings, like, a, palace, temple, or, a, public, square, two, main, roads, cardo, and, decumanus, cross, each, other, at, right, angles, in, the, center, of, the, city, a, few, cities, were, founded, during, the, early, islamic, umayyad, caliphate, the, outlines, of, which, were, based, on, the, ancient, roman, concept, of, the, ideal, city, an, example, of, a, city, planned, according, to, such, concepts, was, excavated, at, anjar, in, lebanon, donald, whitcomb, argues, that, the, early, muslim, conquests, initiated, a, conscious, attempt, to, recreate, specific, morphological, features, characteristic, of, earlier, western, and, southwestern, arabian, cities, the, arab, elite, of, the, early, islam, were, city, dwellers, of, mecca, medina, ta, if, and, the, highly, urbanized, society, of, yemen, whose, arabian, traditions, contributed, to, the, urban, development, of, the, early, islamic, cities, outside, arabia, the, early, military, encampments, of, kufa, basra, fustat, and, kairouan, were, rapidly, transformed, into, permanent, foundations, and, planned, cities, one, of, the, traditions, contributing, to, the, early, islamic, city, was, the, south, arabian, city, such, as, sana, a, to, which, type, mecca, and, fustat, belonged, two, urban, types, based, on, social, organization, have, been, proposed, by, walter, dostal, the, first, is, called, the, san, a, formation, developed, from, a, market, center, and, inhabited, by, groups, of, the, same, tribe, with, social, differentiation, based, on, his, farmer, craftsman, technological, specializations, the, second, urban, type, is, the, tarim, formation, in, which, quarter, organization, reflects, the, social, structure, of, a, multi, tribal, settlement, the, architecture, of, the, oriental, islamic, town, is, based, on, cultural, and, sociological, concepts, which, differ, from, those, of, european, cities, in, both, cultures, a, distinction, is, made, between, the, areas, used, by, the, rulers, and, their, government, and, administration, public, places, of, everyday, common, life, and, the, areas, of, private, life, while, the, structures, and, concepts, of, european, towns, originated, from, a, sociological, struggle, to, gain, basic, rights, of, freedom, or, town, privileges, from, political, or, religious, authorities, during, the, middle, ages, an, islamic, town, or, city, is, fundamentally, influenced, by, the, preservation, of, the, unity, of, secular, and, religious, life, throughout, time, in, a, muslim, city, palaces, and, residences, as, well, as, public, places, like, charitable, or, religious, complexes, mosques, madrasas, and, hospitals, and, private, living, spaces, rather, coexist, alongside, each, other, the, buildings, tend, to, be, more, inwardly, oriented, and, are, separated, from, the, surrounding, outside, either, by, walls, or, by, the, hierarchical, ordering, of, the, streets, or, both, streets, tend, to, lead, from, public, main, roads, to, cul, de, sac, byroads, and, onwards, into, more, private, plots, and, then, end, there, there, are, no, or, very, few, internal, connections, between, different, quarters, of, the, city, in, order, to, move, from, one, quarter, to, the, next, one, has, to, go, back, to, the, main, road, again, within, a, city, quarter, byroads, lead, towards, individual, building, complexes, or, clusters, of, houses, the, individual, house, is, frequently, also, oriented, towards, an, inner, atrium, and, enclosed, by, walls, which, mostly, are, unadorned, unlike, european, outward, oriented, representative, fa, ades, thus, the, spatial, structure, of, a, muslim, city, essentially, reflects, the, ancient, nomadic, tradition, of, living, in, a, family, group, or, tribe, held, together, by, asabiyyah, bond, of, cohesion, or, family, loyalty, strictly, separated, from, the, outside, in, general, the, morphology, of, an, islamic, city, is, granting, or, denying, access, according, to, the, basic, concept, of, hierarchical, degrees, of, privacy, the, inhabitants, move, from, public, space, to, the, living, quarters, of, their, tribe, and, onwards, to, their, family, home, within, a, family, house, there, are, again, to, be, found, common, and, separate, spaces, the, latter, and, most, private, usually, reserved, for, women, and, children, in, the, end, only, the, family, heads, have, free, and, unlimited, access, to, all, rooms, and, areas, of, their, private, home, as, opposed, to, the, more, european, concept, of, interconnecting, different, spaces, for, free, and, easy, access, the, hierarchy, of, privacy, thus, guides, and, structures, the, entire, social, life, in, a, city, from, the, ruler, to, the, commoner, from, the, town, to, the, house, early, islamic, architecture, was, influenced, by, two, different, ancient, traditions, the, transition, process, between, late, antiquity, or, post, classical, and, islamic, architecture, is, exemplified, by, archaeologic, findings, in, north, syria, and, palestine, the, bilad, al, sham, levant, region, of, the, umayyad, and, abbasid, caliphates, in, this, region, late, antique, or, christian, architectural, traditions, merged, with, the, pre, islamic, arabian, heritage, of, the, conquerors, references, on, islamic, architecture, generally, agree, that, pre, islamic, architecture, in, the, arabian, peninsula, had, only, limited, influence, on, the, development, of, islamic, architecture, at, least, by, comparison, with, the, influences, of, existing, architectural, traditions, in, the, conquered, territories, beyond, the, peninsula, in, western, scholarship, a, traditional, assumption, was, that, the, arabs, of, the, early, 7th, century, at, the, time, of, muhammad, were, nomadic, pastoralists, who, did, not, have, strong, architectural, traditions, thanks, to, more, recent, studies, and, archeological, investigations, this, view, has, since, been, revised, and, is, now, considered, obsolete, according, to, scholar, beatrice, saint, laurent, early, academic, investigations, into, the, history, of, islamic, monumental, architecture, led, to, the, flawed, view, that, saw, the, roots, of, an, early, islamic, monumental, architecture, and, art, solely, in, the, traditions, of, the, conquered, regions, scholars, now, agree, that, a, rich, architectural, tradition, also, preceded, the, appearance, of, islam, in, arabia, and, the, first, islamic, monuments, the, major, architectural, contribution, that, took, place, in, arabia, during, the, early, islamic, period, was, the, development, of, a, distinctive, muslim, mosque, the, hypostyle, mosque, constructed, by, muhammad, in, medina, served, as, a, model, for, early, mosque, design, throughout, the, islamic, world, umayyad, religious, architecture, was, the, earliest, expression, of, islamic, art, on, a, grand, scale, and, the, umayyad, mosque, of, damascus, reproduced, the, hypostyle, model, at, a, monumental, scale, moreover, the, umayyads, did, not, come, from, a, cultural, void, and, were, aware, of, their, own, arabian, cultural, history, some, scholars, suggest, they, sought, to, continue, the, pre, islamic, arabian, architectural, tradition, of, building, tall, palaces, to, symbolize, the, ruler, s, power, turkic, peoples, began, moving, into, the, middle, east, from, the, 8th, century, onward, and, after, converting, to, islam, became, major, political, and, military, forces, in, the, region, the, first, major, turkic, dynasty, was, the, ghaznavids, who, ruled, from, ghazna, in, present, day, afghanistan, and, adopted, a, persianate, culture, in, the, second, half, of, the, 12th, century, the, ghurids, of, uncertain, ethnic, origin, replaced, them, as, the, major, power, in, the, region, from, northern, india, to, the, edge, of, the, caspian, sea, among, the, most, remarkable, monuments, of, these, two, dynasties, are, a, number, of, ornate, brick, towers, and, minarets, that, have, survived, as, stand, alone, structures, and, whose, exact, functions, are, unclear, they, include, the, tower, of, mas, ud, iii, near, ghazna, early, 12th, century, and, the, minaret, of, jam, built, by, the, ghurids, late, 12th, century, around, the, same, time, between, the, late, 10th, century, and, the, early, 13th, century, the, turkic, qarakhanids, ruled, in, transoxiana, this, period, is, regarded, as, a, classical, age, of, central, asian, architecture, with, many, constructions, taking, place, in, bukhara, and, samarkand, these, include, a, great, congregational, mosque, in, bukhara, of, which, only, the, kalyan, minaret, survives, c, 1127, the, nearby, minaret, of, vabkent, 1141, and, several, qarakhanid, mausoleums, with, monumental, fa, ades, such, as, those, in, uzgen, present, day, kyrgyzstan, from, the, second, half, of, the, 12th, century, more, significant, was, the, arrival, of, the, seljuk, turks, and, the, formation, of, the, great, seljuk, empire, in, the, 11th, century, which, conquered, all, of, iran, and, other, extensive, territories, in, central, asia, and, the, middle, east, the, most, important, religious, monument, from, the, great, seljuk, period, is, the, jameh, mosque, of, isfahan, which, was, expanded, and, modified, by, various, seljuk, patrons, in, the, late, 11th, century, and, early, 12th, century, two, major, and, innovative, domed, chambers, were, added, to, it, in, the, late, 11th, century, four, large, iwans, were, then, erected, around, the, courtyard, around, the, early, 12th, century, giving, rise, to, the, four, iwan, plan, the, four, iwan, plan, revolutionised, the, form, and, function, of, the, mosques, in, the, region, and, introduced, new, types, of, buildings, involving, madrasas, and, caravanserais, which, spread, through, iran, anatolia, and, syria, large, caravanserais, were, built, as, a, way, to, foster, trade, and, assert, seljuk, authority, in, the, countryside, they, typically, consisted, of, a, building, with, a, fortified, exterior, appearance, monumental, entrance, portal, and, interior, courtyard, surrounded, by, various, halls, including, iwans, some, notable, examples, only, partly, preserved, are, the, caravanserais, of, ribat, i, malik, c, 1068, 1080, and, ribat, i, sharaf, 12th, century, in, transoxiana, and, khorasan, respectively, the, seljuks, also, continued, to, build, tower, tombs, an, iranian, building, type, from, earlier, periods, such, as, the, toghrul, tower, built, in, rayy, south, of, present, day, tehran, in, 1139, more, innovative, however, was, the, introduction, of, mausoleums, with, a, square, or, polygonal, floor, plan, which, later, became, a, common, form, of, monumental, tombs, early, examples, of, this, are, the, two, kharraqan, mausoleums, 1068, and, 1093, near, qazvin, northern, iran, which, have, octagonal, forms, and, the, large, mausoleum, of, sanjar, c, 1127, in, merv, present, day, turkmenistan, which, has, a, square, base, after, the, decline, of, the, great, seljuks, in, the, late, 12th, century, various, turkic, dynasties, formed, smaller, states, and, empires, a, branch, of, the, seljuk, dynasty, ruled, a, sultanate, in, anatolia, also, known, as, the, anatolian, seljuks, the, zengids, and, artuqids, ruled, in, northern, mesopotomia, known, as, the, jazira, and, nearby, regions, and, the, khwarazmian, empire, ruled, over, iran, and, central, asia, until, the, mongol, invasions, of, the, 13th, century, starting, in, the, 10th, century, and, especially, during, the, period, of, seljuk, domination, the, eastern, islamic, world, including, iran, and, central, asia, generally, shared, a, common, architectural, style, this, style, was, characterized, by, the, prominent, use, of, brick, as, both, construction, material, and, decoration, extensive, arcades, glazed, tile, decoration, on, the, outside, of, buildings, the, privileged, use, of, domes, and, vaulting, and, the, increasing, use, of, muqarnas, under, the, seljuks, the, iranian, plan, or, four, iwan, plan, of, mosque, construction, with, four, axial, iwans, appeared, for, the, first, time, lodging, places, kh, n, or, caravanserai, for, travellers, and, their, animals, generally, displayed, utilitarian, rather, than, ornamental, architecture, with, rubble, masonry, strong, fortifications, and, minimal, comfort, the, decline, of, the, seljuks, was, followed, by, the, rise, of, the, khwarazmian, empire, in, central, asia, the, former, khwarazmian, capital, kunya, urgench, in, present, day, turkmenistan, has, preserved, several, structures, from, the, khwarazmian, period, late, 12th, and, early, 13th, century, including, the, so, called, mausoleum, of, fakhr, al, din, razi, possibly, the, tomb, of, il, arslan, and, the, mausoleum, of, sultan, tekesh, iran, and, central, asia, were, conquered, by, the, mongols, in, the, 13th, century, which, led, to, the, establishment, of, the, ilkhanate, the, ilkhanate, period, provided, several, innovations, to, dome, building, that, eventually, enabled, the, persians, to, construct, much, taller, structures, these, changes, later, paved, the, way, for, safavid, architecture, the, pinnacle, of, ilkhanate, architecture, was, reached, with, the, construction, of, uljaytu, s, mausoleum, 1302, 1312, in, soltaniyeh, iran, which, measures, 50, m, in, height, and, 25, m, in, diameter, making, it, the, 3rd, largest, and, the, tallest, masonry, dome, ever, erected, the, thin, double, shelled, dome, was, reinforced, by, arches, between, the, layers, iranian, architecture, and, city, planning, also, reached, an, apogee, under, the, timurids, the, dynasty, founded, by, timur, r, 1370, 1405, timurid, architecture, is, marked, by, its, grand, scale, prominent, double, shelled, domes, extensive, use, of, ceramic, tiles, on, the, outside, and, elaborate, geometric, vaulting, on, the, inside, it, drew, on, the, previous, developments, of, ilkhanid, architecture, and, refined, them, developing, an, imperial, style, that, was, influential, beyond, its, original, borders, such, as, in, the, early, ottoman, empire, to, the, west, and, the, mughal, empire, on, the, indian, subcontinent, the, monuments, erected, by, timur, and, his, successors, are, found, across, the, region, but, concentrated, especially, in, samarkand, and, herat, the, main, capitals, one, of, the, earliest, monuments, is, the, sanctuary, of, ahmed, yasawi, in, present, day, kazakhstan, while, most, of, the, major, monuments, from, timur, s, reign, are, in, samarkand, including, the, gur, e, amir, mausoleum, timur, s, mausoleum, the, shah, i, zinda, necropolis, and, the, bibi, khanum, mosque, after, timur, one, of, the, most, important, patrons, of, architecture, was, gawhar, shad, the, wife, of, sultan, shah, rukh, who, commissioned, the, gawhar, shad, mosque, in, mashhad, and, her, own, mausoleum, in, herat, the, renaissance, in, persian, mosque, and, dome, building, came, during, the, safavid, dynasty, when, shah, abbas, in, 1598, initiated, the, reconstruction, of, isfahan, with, the, naqsh, e, jahan, square, as, the, centerpiece, of, his, new, capital, the, distinct, feature, of, persian, domes, which, separates, them, from, those, domes, created, in, the, christian, world, or, the, ottoman, and, mughal, empires, was, the, colorful, tiles, with, which, they, covered, the, exterior, of, their, domes, as, they, would, on, the, interior, these, domes, soon, numbered, dozens, in, isfahan, and, the, distinct, blue, colored, shape, came, to, dominate, the, skyline, of, the, city, this, distinct, style, of, architecture, was, perfected, during, the, safavid, period, which, saw, the, advent, of, the, haft, rangi, or, seven, colour, style, of, tile, burning, a, process, that, enabled, them, to, apply, more, colours, to, each, tile, creating, richer, patterns, sweeter, to, the, eye, the, colours, that, the, persians, favoured, were, golden, white, and, turquoise, patterns, on, a, dark, blue, background, the, extensive, inscription, bands, of, calligraphy, and, arabesque, on, most, of, the, major, buildings, where, carefully, planned, and, executed, by, ali, reza, abbasi, who, was, appointed, head, of, the, royal, library, and, master, calligrapher, at, the, shah, s, court, in, 1598, while, shaykh, bahai, oversaw, the, construction, projects, reaching, 53, meters, in, height, the, dome, of, the, shah, mosque, would, become, the, tallest, in, the, city, when, it, was, finished, in, 1629, it, was, built, as, a, double, shelled, dome, with, 14, m, spanning, between, the, two, layers, and, resting, on, an, octagonal, dome, chamber, under, zengid, and, artuqid, rule, cities, like, mosul, diyarbakir, hasankeyf, and, mardin, in, upper, mesopotamia, or, al, jazira, in, arabic, became, important, centers, of, architectural, development, that, had, a, long, term, influence, in, the, wider, region, one, of, the, most, notable, monuments, is, the, great, mosque, of, diyarbakir, founded, in, the, 7th, century, but, rebuilt, under, the, seljuks, and, the, artuqids, in, the, 12th, century, it, is, similar, in, form, to, the, umayyad, mosque, of, damascus, and, has, ornate, classical, like, elements, on, its, courtyard, fa, ade, the, city, walls, of, diyarbakir, also, feature, several, towers, built, by, the, artuqids, and, decorated, with, a, mix, of, calligraphic, inscriptions, and, figurative, images, of, animals, and, mythological, creatures, carved, in, stone, one, of, the, culminations, of, later, artuqid, architecture, is, the, zinciriye, or, sultan, isa, madrasa, in, mardin, dating, from, 1385, in, mosul, the, zengid, ruler, nur, al, din, built, the, al, nuri, mosque, 1148, and, 1170, 1172, of, which, only, the, original, minaret, was, preserved, up, to, modern, times, the, minaret, and, the, rebuilt, mosque, were, recently, destroyed, in, the, battle, of, mosul, damascus, regained, some, prominence, after, it, came, under, nur, al, din, s, control, in, 1154, that, same, year, nur, al, din, founded, a, hospital, complex, the, maristan, al, nuri, or, bimaristan, of, nur, al, din, which, was, highly, influential, in, the, islamic, world, and, is, notable, for, the, muqarnas, vaulting, of, its, entrance, portal, and, a, muqarnas, dome, of, mesopotamian, influence, over, the, vestibule, the, zengids, and, their, successors, the, kurdish, ayyubid, dynasty, built, many, more, madrasas, fortifications, hammams, and, other, charitable, buildings, in, the, cities, of, syria, unlike, seljuk, and, iranian, madrasas, the, syrian, madrasas, are, smaller, and, more, diverse, in, their, layouts, adapted, to, the, dense, urban, fabric, of, cities, like, damascus, and, aleppo, e, g, adiliya, madrasa, in, damascus, and, firdaws, madrasa, in, aleppo, the, anatolian, seljuks, ruled, a, territory, that, was, multi, ethnic, and, only, newly, settled, by, muslims, as, a, result, their, architecture, was, eclectic, and, incorporated, influences, from, other, cultures, such, as, iranian, armenian, and, local, byzantine, architecture, in, contrast, with, seljuk, constructions, further, east, anatolian, architecture, was, largely, built, of, stone, the, golden, age, of, their, anatolian, empire, with, its, capital, at, konya, was, in, the, early, 13th, century, seljuk, authority, declined, after, their, defeat, by, the, mongols, in, 1243, the, mongol, ilkhanids, then, ruled, eastern, anatolia, indirectly, through, seljuk, vassals, until, 1308, when, they, took, direct, control, smaller, principalities, and, local, emirates, known, collectively, as, the, beyliks, progressively, emerged, despite, this, decline, the, seljuk, tradition, of, architecture, largely, persisted, and, continued, to, evolve, under, these, new, rulers, decoration, in, anatolian, seljuk, architecture, was, concentrated, on, entrance, portals, windows, and, mihrabs, stone, carving, was, one, of, the, most, accomplished, techniques, with, motifs, ranging, from, earlier, iranian, stucco, motifs, to, local, byzantine, and, armenian, motifs, the, madrasas, of, sivas, and, the, ince, minareli, medrese, c, 1265, in, konya, are, among, the, most, notable, examples, while, the, great, mosque, and, hospital, complex, of, divri, i, is, distinguished, by, some, of, the, most, eclectic, and, extravagant, stone, carving, in, the, region, syrian, style, ablaq, striped, marble, also, appears, on, some, entrance, portals, in, konya, anatolian, architecture, innovated, further, in, the, use, of, tile, revetments, to, cover, entire, surfaces, independently, of, other, forms, of, decoration, as, seen, in, the, karatay, medrese, 1251, 1252, in, konya, and, evidenced, by, the, mosaic, tiles, recovered, from, the, kubadabad, palace, c, 1236, or, early, 13th, century, anatolian, seljuk, mosques, included, more, conservative, hypostyle, constructions, alongside, less, traditional, floor, plans, an, important, hypostyle, example, is, the, alaeddin, mosque, of, konya, built, between, 1156, and, 1235, with, later, additions, mosques, in, the, later, beylik, period, were, more, diverse, in, form, such, as, the, saruhanid, congregational, mosque, in, manisa, 1371, the, isa, bey, mosque, in, sel, uk, 1374, and, the, lyas, bey, mosque, in, miletus, 1304, madrasas, were, typically, centered, around, either, a, traditional, open, courtyard, bordered, by, a, varying, number, of, iwans, e, g, ifte, minareli, medrese, in, erzurum, and, the, g, k, medrese, in, sivas, or, a, central, court, covered, by, a, dome, e, g, the, karatay, and, ince, minareli, madrasas, in, konya, monumental, caravanserais, were, also, built, along, trade, routes, typically, with, a, fortified, exterior, appearance, a, tall, entrance, portal, decorated, with, carved, stone, and, an, interior, courtyard, that, sometimes, contained, a, cubic, prayer, room, elevated, in, the, center, e, g, the, sultan, han, southwest, of, aksaray, and, another, sultan, han, northeast, of, kayseri, the, mamluks, were, a, military, corps, recruited, from, slaves, that, served, under, the, ayyubid, dynasty, and, eventually, took, over, from, that, dynasty, in, 1250, ruling, over, egypt, the, levant, and, the, hijaz, until, the, ottoman, conquest, of, 1517, despite, their, often, tumultuous, and, violent, internal, politics, the, mamluk, sultans, were, prolific, patrons, of, architecture, and, contributed, enormously, to, the, repertoire, of, monuments, in, historic, cairo, their, capital, some, long, reigning, sultans, such, as, al, nasir, muhammad, r, 1293, 1341, with, interruptions, and, qaytbay, r, 1468, 1496, were, especially, prolific, while, cairo, was, the, main, center, of, patronage, mamluk, architecture, also, appears, in, other, cities, of, their, realm, such, as, damascus, jerusalem, aleppo, and, medina, mamluk, architecture, is, distinguished, in, part, by, the, construction, of, multi, functional, buildings, whose, floor, plans, became, increasingly, creative, and, complex, due, to, the, limited, available, space, in, the, city, and, the, desire, to, make, monuments, visually, dominant, in, their, urban, surroundings, patrons, including, sultans, and, high, ranking, emirs, typically, set, out, to, build, mausoleums, for, themselves, but, attached, to, them, various, charitable, structures, such, as, madrasas, khanqahs, sabils, or, mosques, the, revenues, and, expenses, of, these, charitable, complexes, were, governed, by, inalienable, waqf, agreements, that, also, served, the, secondary, purpose, of, ensuring, some, form, of, income, or, property, for, the, patrons, descendants, the, cruciform, or, four, iwan, floor, plan, was, adopted, for, madrasas, and, became, more, common, for, new, monumental, complexes, than, the, traditional, hypostyle, mosque, although, the, vaulted, iwans, of, the, early, period, were, replaced, with, flat, roofed, iwans, in, the, later, period, the, decoration, of, monuments, also, became, more, elaborate, over, time, with, stone, carving, and, colored, marble, paneling, and, mosaics, including, ablaq, replacing, stucco, as, the, most, dominant, architectural, decoration, monumental, decorated, entrance, portals, became, common, compared, to, earlier, periods, often, carved, with, muqarnas, influences, from, the, syrian, region, ilkhanid, iran, and, possibly, even, venice, were, evident, in, these, trends, minarets, which, were, also, elaborate, usually, consisted, of, three, tiers, separated, by, balconies, with, each, tier, having, a, different, design, than, the, others, late, mamluk, minarets, for, example, most, typically, had, an, octagonal, shaft, for, the, first, tier, a, round, shaft, on, the, second, and, a, lantern, structure, with, finial, on, the, third, level, domes, also, transitioned, from, wooden, or, brick, structures, sometimes, of, bulbous, shape, to, pointed, stone, domes, with, complex, geometric, or, arabesque, motifs, carved, into, their, outer, surfaces, the, peak, of, this, stone, dome, architecture, was, achieved, under, the, reign, of, qaytbay, in, the, late, 15th, century, after, the, ottoman, conquest, of, 1517, new, ottoman, style, buildings, were, introduced, however, the, mamluk, style, continued, to, be, repeated, or, combined, with, ottoman, elements, in, many, subsequent, monuments, some, building, types, from, the, late, mamluk, period, such, as, sabil, kuttabs, a, combination, of, sabil, and, kuttab, and, multi, storied, caravanserais, wikala, s, or, khan, s, actually, grew, in, number, during, the, ottoman, period, in, modern, times, from, the, late, 19th, century, onwards, a, neo, mamluk, style, was, also, used, partly, as, a, nationalist, response, against, ottoman, and, european, styles, in, an, effort, to, promote, local, egyptian, styles, though, the, architects, were, sometimes, europeans, examples, of, this, style, are, the, museum, of, islamic, arts, in, cairo, the, al, rifa, i, mosque, the, abu, al, abbas, al, mursi, mosque, in, alexandria, and, numerous, private, and, public, buildings, such, as, those, of, heliopolis, the, architecture, of, the, ottoman, empire, developed, from, earlier, seljuk, architecture, with, influences, from, byzantine, and, iranian, architecture, along, with, architectural, traditions, of, the, balkans, and, other, parts, of, middle, east, the, classical, architecture, of, the, ottoman, empire, was, a, mixture, of, native, turkish, tradition, and, influences, from, hagia, sophia, one, of, the, best, representatives, of, this, period, is, mimar, sinan, whose, works, include, the, s, leymaniye, mosque, in, istanbul, and, the, selimiye, mosque, in, edirne, beginning, in, the, 18th, century, ottoman, architecture, was, influenced, by, the, baroque, architecture, in, western, europe, nuruosmaniye, mosque, is, one, of, the, surviving, examples, from, this, period, the, last, ottoman, period, saw, more, influences, from, western, europe, brought, in, by, architects, such, those, from, the, balyan, family, this, period, also, saw, the, development, of, a, new, architectural, style, called, neo, ottoman, or, ottoman, revivalism, also, known, as, the, first, national, architectural, movement, by, architects, such, as, mimar, kemaleddin, and, vedat, tek, while, istanbul, was, the, main, site, of, imperial, patronage, for, most, of, the, empire, s, history, the, early, capitals, of, bursa, and, edirne, also, contain, a, concentration, of, ottoman, monuments, ottoman, architecture, is, also, found, across, the, empire, s, provinces, ranging, from, eastern, europe, to, the, middle, east, to, north, africa, major, religious, monuments, such, as, those, sponsored, by, sultan, and, his, family, were, typically, architectural, complexes, known, as, a, k, lliye, which, had, multiple, elements, providing, various, charitable, services, these, complexes, were, governed, and, managed, with, the, help, of, a, vakif, agreement, arabic, waqf, for, example, the, fatih, mosque, in, istanbul, was, part, of, a, very, large, k, lliye, founded, by, mehmed, ii, built, between, 1463, and, 1470, which, also, included, a, tabhane, guesthouse, for, travelers, an, imaret, charitable, kitchen, a, dar, ifa, hospital, a, caravanserai, a, mektep, primary, school, a, library, a, hammam, bathhouse, a, cemetery, with, the, founder, s, mausoleum, and, eight, madrasas, along, with, their, annexes, the, buildings, were, arranged, in, a, regular, partly, symmetrical, layout, with, the, monumental, mosque, at, its, center, although, not, all, the, structures, have, survived, to, the, present, day, the, architectural, style, which, developed, in, the, westernmost, territories, of, the, historic, muslim, world, is, often, referred, to, as, moorish, architecture, the, term, moorish, comes, from, the, european, designation, of, the, muslim, inhabitants, of, these, regions, as, moors, scholars, sometimes, use, western, islamic, architecture, or, architecture, of, the, islamic, west, as, a, more, precise, term, for, this, subject, this, architectural, style, developed, primarily, in, al, andalus, present, day, spain, between, 711, and, 1492, and, portugal, between, 711, and, 1249, and, in, western, north, africa, including, morocco, algeria, and, tunisia, part, of, the, maghreb, it, blended, influences, from, berber, amazigh, culture, in, north, africa, pre, islamic, spain, roman, byzantine, and, visigothic, and, contemporary, artistic, currents, in, the, islamic, middle, east, to, elaborate, a, unique, style, over, centuries, with, recognizable, features, such, as, the, moorish, arch, riad, gardens, symmetrically, divided, courtyard, gardens, and, elaborate, geometric, and, arabesque, motifs, in, wood, stucco, and, tilework, notably, zellij, major, centers, of, this, artistic, development, included, the, main, capitals, of, the, empires, and, muslim, states, in, the, region, s, history, such, as, cordoba, kairouan, fes, marrakesh, seville, granada, and, tlemcen, among, the, best, known, monuments, from, these, areas, are, the, great, mosque, of, kairouan, the, great, mosque, of, cordoba, the, palace, city, of, madinat, al, zahra, near, cordoba, the, qarawiyyin, mosque, in, fes, the, great, mosque, of, tlemcen, the, kutubiyya, mosque, marrakesh, the, giralda, tower, seville, and, the, fortified, palace, complex, of, the, alhambra, granada, even, after, the, christian, conquests, of, al, andalus, the, legacy, of, moorish, architecture, was, still, carried, on, in, the, mud, jar, style, in, spain, which, made, use, of, moorish, techniques, and, designs, and, adapted, them, to, christian, patrons, in, north, africa, the, medieval, moorish, style, was, perpetuated, in, moroccan, architecture, with, relatively, few, changes, while, in, algeria, and, tunisia, it, became, blended, with, ottoman, architecture, after, the, ottoman, conquest, of, the, region, in, the, 16th, century, much, later, particularly, in, the, 19th, century, the, moorish, style, was, frequently, imitated, or, emulated, in, the, neo, moorish, or, moorish, revival, style, which, emerged, in, europe, and, america, as, part, of, the, romanticist, interest, in, the, orient, and, also, notably, as, a, recurring, choice, for, new, jewish, synagogue, architecture, in, addition, to, the, general, moorish, style, some, styles, and, structures, in, north, africa, are, distinctively, associated, with, areas, that, have, maintained, strong, berber, populations, and, cultures, including, but, not, limited, to, the, atlas, mountain, regions, of, morocco, the, aur, s, and, m, zab, regions, of, algeria, and, southern, tunisia, they, do, not, form, one, single, style, but, rather, a, diverse, variety, of, local, vernacular, styles, in, morocco, the, largely, berber, inhabited, rural, valleys, and, oases, of, the, atlas, and, the, south, are, marked, by, numerous, kasbahs, fortresses, and, ksour, fortified, villages, typically, flat, roofed, structures, made, of, rammed, earth, and, decorated, with, local, geometric, motifs, as, with, the, famous, example, of, ait, benhaddou, likewise, southern, tunisia, is, dotted, with, hilltop, ksour, and, multi, story, fortified, granaries, ghorfa, such, as, the, examples, in, medenine, and, ksar, ouled, soltane, typically, built, with, loose, stone, bound, by, a, mortar, of, clay, the, island, of, jerba, in, tunisia, has, a, traditional, mosque, architecture, featuring, low, lying, structures, built, in, stone, and, covered, in, whitewash, their, prayer, halls, are, domed, and, they, have, short, round, minarets, the, m, zab, region, of, algeria, e, g, gharda, a, also, has, distinctive, mosques, and, houses, that, are, completely, whitewashed, but, built, in, rammed, earth, its, structures, also, make, frequent, use, of, domes, and, barrel, vaults, unlike, jerba, the, distinctive, minarets, here, are, tall, and, have, a, square, base, tapering, towards, the, end, and, crowned, with, horn, like, corners, yemeni, architecture, can, be, characterized, as, conservative, as, it, combines, both, pre, islamic, and, islamic, features, in, antiquity, yemen, was, home, to, several, wealthy, city, states, and, an, indigenous, tradition, of, south, arabian, architecture, by, the, 5th, century, ad, there, is, evidence, that, the, indigenous, styles, were, being, influenced, by, byzantine, and, late, antique, mediterranean, art, yemen, was, islamized, in, the, 7th, century, but, few, buildings, from, the, early, islamic, period, have, been, preserved, intact, today, it, is, only, from, the, 10th, century, onward, that, distinctive, islamic, architectural, styles, can, be, documented, one, type, of, mosque, attested, during, the, early, period, of, sulayhid, and, rasulid, rule, consisted, of, a, large, cubic, chamber, with, one, entrance, which, had, antecedents, in, the, pre, islamic, temple, architecture, of, the, region, another, type, consisted, of, a, rectangular, chamber, with, a, transverse, orientation, with, multiple, entrances, and, supporting, columns, inside, sometimes, preceded, by, a, courtyard, the, hypostyle, mosque, with, courtyard, common, elsewhere, was, comparatively, rare, in, early, islamic, yemen, the, great, mosque, of, sanaa, origiinally, commissioned, by, the, umayyad, caliph, al, walid, r, 705, 15, and, reconstructed, at, later, times, was, one, of, the, few, mosques, of, this, type, in, the, region, the, mosque, s, decoration, reflects, yemeni, techniques, of, carved, and, painted, wood, carved, stone, and, carved, stucco, the, ayyubids, introduced, domed, mosque, types, as, well, as, sunni, syle, madrasas, to, the, region, but, none, of, their, buildings, in, yemen, have, survived, the, rasulids, who, followed, them, 13th, 15th, centuries, were, prolific, patrons, of, architecture, and, perpetuated, these, new, building, types, influenced, by, their, political, links, with, egypt, during, the, same, period, the, zaydi, imams, in, northern, yemen, were, buried, in, richly, decorated, domed, tombs, with, the, advent, of, ottoman, rule, in, yemen, after, 1538, rasulid, style, architecture, continued, to, be, the, local, norm, in, sunni, controlled, areas, but, elements, of, ottoman, architecture, began, to, be, introduced, in, the, late, 16th, century, yemen, is, also, notable, for, its, historic, tower, houses, built, on, two, or, more, floors, these, houses, vary, in, form, and, materials, from, region, to, region, they, are, typically, built, of, mud, rammed, earth, or, sun, dried, mud, brick, stone, or, a, combination, of, both, with, timber, used, for, roofs, and, floors, while, these, structures, are, repaired, and, restored, over, time, this, architectural, style, has, remained, generally, unchanged, for, hundreds, of, years, the, old, city, of, sanaa, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, today, contains, many, examples, some, villages, and, towns, such, as, rada, a, were, built, around, a, fortified, citadel, e, g, the, citadel, of, rada, a, others, were, encircled, by, a, high, mud, brick, wall, e, g, shibam, and, some, were, built, so, that, the, houses, themselves, formed, an, outer, wall, along, the, perimeter, e, g, khawlan, indo, islamic, architecture, on, the, indian, subcontinent, began, in, sindh, in, the, 8th, century, where, remains, of, a, congregational, mosque, at, banbhore, dating, to, 725, have, been, uncovered, the, ghurids, laid, the, foundations, of, the, delhi, sultanate, and, built, monuments, in, northern, india, in, the, 12th, and, 13th, centuries, the, most, notable, monument, of, this, period, is, the, quwwat, al, islam, mosque, complex, and, the, qutb, minar, which, were, begun, in, the, 1190s, by, sultan, qutb, al, din, aybak, the, mosque, s, initial, construction, reused, spolia, from, hindu, and, jain, temples, and, the, complex, became, a, prototype, for, many, mosques, built, in, the, region, afterwards, the, progress, of, islamization, in, the, region, during, the, 14th, and, 15th, centuries, resulted, in, the, emergence, of, a, more, distinctive, indo, islamic, style, around, this, time, as, exemplified, by, the, monuments, built, under, the, tughluq, dynasty, and, other, local, states, among, other, features, this, style, made, increased, use, of, arches, vaulted, spaces, domes, and, water, features, while, also, integrating, them, with, indigenous, indian, architectural, elements, in, the, northwestern, part, of, the, subcontinent, some, notable, examples, from, this, period, include, the, tomb, of, rukn, i, alam, in, multan, and, the, congregational, mosque, of, ahmedabad, 1423, the, latter, of, which, is, a, particularly, harmonious, example, of, islamic, and, indigenous, indian, elements, combined, in, one, building, the, best, known, style, of, indo, islamic, architecture, is, mughal, architecture, mostly, built, between, about, 1560, and, 1720, early, mughal, architecture, developed, from, existing, indo, islamic, architecture, but, also, followed, the, model, of, timurid, architecture, due, in, part, to, the, timurid, ancestry, of, the, mughal, dynasty, s, founder, babur, mughal, architecture, s, most, prominent, examples, are, the, series, of, imperial, mausolea, which, started, with, the, pivotal, tomb, of, humayun, the, most, famous, is, the, taj, mahal, in, agra, completed, in, 1648, by, emperor, shah, jahan, in, memory, of, his, wife, mumtaz, mahal, who, died, while, giving, birth, to, their, 14th, child, the, taj, mahal, is, completely, symmetrical, except, for, shah, jahan, s, sarcophagus, which, is, placed, off, center, in, the, crypt, room, below, the, main, floor, this, symmetry, extended, to, the, building, of, an, entire, mirror, mosque, in, black, marble, to, complement, the, mecca, facing, mosque, placed, to, the, west, of, the, main, structure, another, slightly, later, imperial, mausoleum, is, the, bibi, ka, maqbara, in, aurangabad, 1678, which, was, commissioned, by, the, sixth, mughal, emperor, aurangzeb, in, memory, of, his, wife, the, mughals, also, built, monumental, palaces, and, mosques, a, famous, example, of, the, charbagh, style, of, mughal, garden, is, the, shalimar, gardens, in, lahore, where, the, domeless, tomb, of, jahangir, is, also, located, the, red, fort, in, delhi, and, the, agra, fort, are, huge, castle, like, fortified, palaces, and, the, abandoned, city, of, fatehpur, sikri, 26, miles, 42, km, west, of, agra, was, built, for, akbar, in, the, late, 16th, century, major, mosques, built, by, mughal, emperors, and, their, family, include, the, jama, masjid, friday, mosque, in, delhi, the, badshahi, mosque, in, lahore, and, other, mosques, of, similar, form, which, were, often, built, near, or, within, other, imperial, complexes, even, the, mughal, nobility, were, able, to, build, relatively, major, monuments, as, with, the, example, of, the, wazir, khan, mosque, in, lahore, 1635, built, by, wazir, khan, when, he, was, governor, of, the, punjab, under, shah, jahan, in, the, later, mughal, period, some, local, governors, became, semi, autonomous, prompting, them, to, build, their, own, monuments, and, embellish, their, own, regional, capitals, with, highly, creative, local, styles, of, architecture, the, bara, imambara, complex, c, 1780, built, by, asaf, al, dawla, in, lucknow, is, an, example, of, this, the, deccan, sultanates, in, the, southern, regions, of, the, indian, subcontinent, also, developed, their, local, indo, islamic, deccani, architectural, styles, exemplified, by, monuments, such, as, the, charminar, in, hyderabad, 1591, and, gol, gumbaz, in, bijapur, 1656, in, the, eastern, part, of, the, indian, subcontinent, the, bengali, region, developed, a, distinct, regional, style, under, the, independent, bengal, sultanate, which, flourished, between, the, 14th, and, 16th, centuries, it, incorporated, influences, from, persia, byzantium, and, north, india, which, were, with, blended, indigenous, bengali, elements, such, as, curved, roofs, corner, towers, and, complex, terracotta, ornamentation, one, feature, in, the, sultanate, was, the, relative, absence, of, minarets, many, small, and, medium, sized, medieval, mosques, with, multiple, domes, and, artistic, niche, mihrabs, were, constructed, throughout, the, region, the, grand, mosque, of, bengal, was, the, adina, mosque, 1374, 75, the, largest, mosque, in, the, indian, subcontinent, though, partially, ruined, today, built, of, stone, demolished, from, temples, it, featured, a, monumental, ribbed, barrel, vault, over, the, central, nave, the, first, such, giant, vault, used, anywhere, in, the, subcontinent, the, mosque, was, modeled, on, the, imperial, sasanian, style, of, persia, another, exceptional, example, which, survives, in, present, day, bangladesh, is, the, sat, gumbaz, sixty, dome, mosque, in, bagerhat, c, 1450, later, a, provincial, style, influenced, by, north, india, evolved, in, mughal, bengal, during, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, the, mughals, also, copied, the, bengali, do, chala, roof, tradition, for, mausoleums, in, north, india, islam, spread, gradually, in, the, malay, indonesia, archipelago, from, the, 12th, century, onwards, and, especially, during, the, 15th, century, as, the, sultanate, of, malacca, dominated, the, region, the, introduction, of, islam, was, slow, and, gradual, the, advent, of, islam, did, not, lead, to, the, introduction, of, a, new, building, tradition, but, saw, the, appropriation, of, existing, architectural, forms, which, were, reinterpreted, to, suit, muslim, requirements, existing, architectural, features, in, malay, indonesia, such, as, the, candi, bentar, gate, paduraksa, normally, marks, the, entrance, to, the, most, sacred, precincts, balai, nobat, a, tower, supposedly, used, to, store, royal, musical, instruments, and, the, sacred, pyramidal, roof, was, used, for, islamic, architecture, for, centuries, malay, indonesian, mosques, lacked, domes, or, minarets, both, considered, of, middle, eastern, origin, malay, indonesian, original, mosques, feature, multi, layered, pyramidal, roofs, and, no, minaret, prayer, is, called, by, striking, a, prayer, s, drum, known, as, beduk, the, minaret, of, the, menara, kudus, mosque, is, a, great, example, of, malay, indonesian, architecture, malay, indonesian, mosque, architecture, also, features, strong, influence, from, the, middle, eastern, architecture, styles, this, style, of, architecture, can, be, found, on, the, design, of, mosques, in, brunei, indonesia, malaysia, singapore, the, philippines, and, thailand, today, with, increasing, muslim, pilgrimage, to, mecca, malay, indonesian, mosques, are, developing, a, more, standard, international, style, with, a, dome, and, minaret, the, oldest, surviving, mosque, in, indonesia, is, the, great, mosque, of, demak, which, is, the, royal, mosque, of, the, sultanate, of, demak, although, this, is, not, the, oldest, islamic, structure, the, oldest, islamic, structure, in, indonesia, are, parts, of, the, royal, palace, in, sultanate, of, cirebon, cirebon, the, palace, complex, contains, a, chronogram, which, can, be, read, as, the, saka, equivalent, of, 1454, ce, early, islamic, palaces, retain, many, features, of, pre, islamic, architecture, which, is, apparent, in, the, gates, or, drum, towers, the, kasepuhan, palace, was, probably, begun, in, the, late, pre, islamic, period, and, continued, to, grow, during, the, hinduism, to, islam, transitional, period, the, complex, contains, clues, to, the, stages, of, the, process, of, the, gradual, changes, as, islam, become, incorporated, into, indonesian, architecture, two, of, the, hindu, features, adopted, into, islam, in, the, palace, is, the, two, types, of, gateways, the, split, portal, candi, bentar, which, provides, access, to, the, public, audience, pavilion, and, the, lintel, gate, paduraksa, which, leads, to, the, frontcourt, the, original, mosque, in, malaysia, had, a, basic, architectural, style, and, structure, with, four, pillars, for, the, foundation, and, palm, fronds, for, the, roof, in, malacca, the, architectural, design, is, a, cross, between, local, malay, indian, and, chinese, architecture, traditionally, the, minaret, resembles, a, pagoda, with, the, style, of, balai, nobat, an, ancient, cemetery, also, usually, lies, next, to, the, mosque, is, where, some, notable, preachers, and, missionaries, are, buried, as, in, other, regions, chinese, islamic, architecture, reflects, local, architecture, in, its, style, some, chinese, mosques, especially, in, eastern, china, resemble, traditional, chinese, temples, with, flared, buddhist, style, roofs, and, minarets, resembling, pagodas, in, western, china, mosques, resemble, those, of, the, middle, east, with, slender, minarets, arches, and, domed, roofs, in, northwest, china, the, chinese, hui, built, their, mosques, in, a, combination, of, eastern, and, western, styles, the, mosques, are, set, in, walled, courtyards, entered, through, archways, and, they, feature, flared, roofs, miniature, domes, and, minarets, the, first, chinese, mosque, was, established, in, the, seventh, century, during, the, tang, dynasty, in, xi, an, the, great, mosque, of, xi, an, whose, current, buildings, date, from, the, ming, dynasty, does, not, replicate, many, of, the, features, often, associated, with, traditional, mosques, instead, it, follows, traditional, chinese, architecture, tatar, architecture, has, evolved, through, the, periods, of, the, golden, horde, the, tatar, khanates, and, under, the, rule, of, the, russian, empire, many, traditional, tatar, mosques, built, by, the, volga, tatars, have, a, gabled, roof, and, a, minaret, placed, in, the, center, of, the, mosque, above, the, roof, rather, than, at, the, side, or, corner, of, the, building, examples, of, such, mosques, survive, from, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, and, were, restored, in, modern, times, this, style, is, also, found, among, the, wooden, mosques, of, the, lithuanian, tatars, whose, mosque, architecture, was, influenced, by, the, kazan, volga, tatars, another, type, of, mosque, with, a, domed, roof, and, a, minaret, standing, above, the, entrance, appeared, in, the, mid, 19th, century, in, west, africa, muslim, merchants, played, a, vital, role, in, the, western, sahel, region, since, the, 9th, century, through, trans, saharan, trade, networks, while, the, islamic, architecture, of, this, region, shares, a, certain, style, a, wide, variety, of, materials, and, local, styles, are, evident, across, this, wide, geographic, range, in, the, more, arid, western, sahara, and, northern, sahel, regions, stone, predominates, as, a, building, material, and, is, often, associated, with, berber, cultures, in, the, southern, sahel, and, savannah, regions, mud, brick, and, rammed, earth, are, the, main, material, and, is, now, associated, with, the, most, monumental, examples, of, west, african, islamic, architecture, in, some, places, like, timbuktu, and, oualata, both, building, materials, are, used, together, with, stone, constructions, either, covered, or, bound, with, a, mud, plaster, the, earliest, mosques, discovered, in, sub, saharan, africa, are, at, kumbi, saleh, in, present, day, southern, mauritania, the, former, capital, of, the, ghana, empire, here, a, mosque, has, been, discovered, which, consisted, of, a, courtyard, a, prayer, hall, and, a, square, minaret, built, in, dry, stone, covered, in, red, mud, used, as, plaster, on, both, the, exterior, and, interior, of, the, mosque, this, plaster, was, painted, with, floral, geometric, and, epigraphic, motifs, a, similar, stone, mosque, from, the, same, period, has, been, found, at, awdaghust, both, mosques, are, dated, generally, between, the, 9th, and, 14th, centuries, at, kumbi, saleh, locals, lived, in, domed, shaped, dwellings, in, the, king, s, section, of, the, city, surrounded, by, a, great, enclosure, traders, lived, in, stone, houses, in, a, section, which, possessed, 12, mosques, as, described, by, al, bakri, one, centered, on, friday, prayer, as, islamization, progressed, across, the, region, more, variations, developed, in, mosque, architecture, including, the, adoption, of, traditional, local, forms, not, previously, associated, with, islamic, architecture, under, songhai, influence, minarets, took, on, a, more, pyramidal, appearance, and, became, stepped, or, tiered, on, three, levels, as, exemplified, by, the, tower, of, the, mosque, tomb, of, askia, al, hajj, muhammad, in, gao, present, day, mali, in, timbuktu, the, sankor, mosque, established, in, the, 14th, 15th, centuries, and, rebuilt, in, the, 16th, century, with, later, additions, had, a, tapering, minaret, and, a, prayer, hall, with, rows, of, arches, the, presence, of, tapering, minarets, may, also, reflect, cultural, contacts, with, m, zab, region, to, the, north, while, decoration, found, at, timbuktu, may, reflect, contacts, with, berber, communities, in, what, is, now, mauritania, in, the, earthen, mud, architecture, of, the, region, scholar, andrew, petersen, distinguishes, two, main, styles, a, western, style, that, may, have, its, roots, in, djenn, present, day, mali, and, an, eastern, style, associated, with, hausa, architecture, that, may, have, its, roots, in, kano, present, day, nigeria, the, eastern, or, hausa, style, is, generally, more, plain, on, the, exterior, of, buildings, but, is, characterized, by, diverse, interior, decoration, and, the, much, greater, use, of, wood, mosques, often, have, prayer, halls, with, pillars, supporting, flat, or, slightly, domed, roofs, of, wood, and, mud, an, exceptional, example, is, the, 19th, century, great, mosque, of, zaria, present, day, nigeria, which, has, parabolic, arches, and, a, roof, of, shallow, domes, the, western, or, sudan, style, is, characterized, by, more, elaborate, and, decorated, exterior, fa, ades, whose, compositions, emphasize, verticality, they, have, tapering, buttresses, with, cone, shaped, summits, mosques, have, a, large, tower, over, the, mihrab, and, wooden, stakes, toron, are, often, embedded, in, the, walls, used, for, scaffolding, but, possibly, also, for, some, symbolic, purpose, more, hybrid, styles, also, arose, further, south, and, on, the, edge, of, islamized, areas, in, the, fouta, djallon, region, in, the, guinea, highlands, mosques, were, built, with, a, traditional, rectangular, or, square, layout, but, then, covered, by, a, huge, conical, thatched, roof, which, protects, from, the, rain, this, type, of, roof, was, an, existing, feature, of, the, traditional, circular, huts, inhabited, by, the, locals, re, adapted, to, cover, new, rectangular, mosques, when, the, mostly, muslim, fula, people, settled, the, region, in, the, 18th, century, a, good, example, is, the, friday, mosque, of, dinguiraye, in, guinea, built, in, 1850, with, later, restorations, many, others, are, attested, in, the, same, region, overlapping, with, southern, senegal, western, mali, and, burkina, faso, during, the, french, colonial, occupation, of, the, sahel, french, engineers, and, architects, had, a, role, in, popularizing, a, neo, sudanese, style, based, on, local, traditional, architecture, but, emphasizing, symmetry, and, monumentality, the, great, mosque, of, djenn, which, was, previously, established, in, the, 14th, century, but, demolished, in, the, early, 19th, century, was, rebuilt, in, 1906, 1907, under, the, direction, of, ismaila, traor, and, with, guidance, from, french, engineers, now, the, largest, earthen, building, in, sub, saharan, africa, it, served, as, a, model, for, the, new, style, and, for, other, mosques, in, the, region, including, the, grand, mosque, of, mopti, built, by, the, french, administration, in, 1935, other, 20th, century, and, more, recent, mosques, in, west, africa, have, tended, to, replicate, a, more, generic, style, similar, to, that, of, modern, egypt, east, african, architecture, lacks, some, features, typical, of, islamic, architecture, such, as, the, construction, of, hammams, historic, mosques, were, generally, rectangular, in, plan, lacked, courtyards, and, featured, side, rooms, along, the, east, african, coast, common, construction, materials, included, coral, stone, sundried, bricks, and, limestone, in, the, somali, coastal, towns, local, architecture, reflected, a, certain, degree, of, influence, from, islamic, architecture, in, other, regions, new, buildings, were, often, built, on, the, ruins, of, older, structures, a, practice, that, continued, for, centuries, the, oldest, known, mosques, in, the, region, were, excavated, at, shanga, in, present, day, kenya, where, a, succession, of, mosques, on, one, site, were, built, and, rebuilt, from, the, 9th, to, 14th, centuries, other, early, mosques, include, the, great, mosque, of, kilwa, described, below, the, kizimkazi, mosque, in, zanzibar, rebuilt, in, the, 18th, century, over, 12th, foundations, and, three, 13th,

architecturally, sophisticated, mosque, in, east, africa, it, consists, of, a, courtyard, leading, to, a, square, hypostyle, prayer, of, nine, bays, with, a, dome, over, the, central, bay, which, resembles, the, conical, domes, of, anatolian, seljuk, architecture, the, mihrab, is, carved, from, marble, from, northern, india, it, also, features, the, oldest, known, minaret, in, east, africa, a, feature, which, did, not, become, common, in, the, region, until, the, 19th, century, kilwa, off, the, coast, of, tanzania, hosts, the, remains, of, multiple, historic, mosques, and, palaces, the, great, mosque, is, most, impressive, the, largest, in, east, africa, before, the, 19th, century, it, was, built, and, modified, in, multiple, phases, with, the, oldest, surviving, section, dating, possibly, to, the, 11th, century, to, which, was, later, added, a, courtyard, with, porticos, of, coral, stone, columns, and, a, side, chamber, with, the, largest, historic, dome, on, the, east, african, coast, 5, meters, in, diameter, the, courtyard, is, the, only, known, medieval, example, of, its, kind, in, the, region, though, it, was, rebuilt, and, covered, with, domes, and, barrel, vaults, in, the, 15th, century, apart, from, mosques, the, most, common, type, of, historic, building, to, have, survived, even, if, only, partially, are, palaces, monumental, palaces, have, been, excavated, at, shanga, and, at, manda, which, date, from, before, 1000, ce, the, largest, pre, 19th, century, palace, along, the, coastal, region, is, husuni, kubwa, at, kilwa, dating, possibly, to, the, 13th, century, which, has, an, imposing, entrance, and, multiple, sections, arranged, around, internal, courtyards, starting, in, the, early, 19th, century, the, omanis, introduced, a, new, type, of, palace, with, multiple, stories, in, modern, times, the, architecture, of, islamic, buildings, not, just, religious, ones, has, gone, through, some, changes, the, new, architectural, style, doesn, t, stick, with, the, same, fundamental, aspects, that, were, seen, in, the, past, but, mosques, for, the, most, part, still, feature, the, same, parts, the, mi, r, b, the, minarets, four, iwan, plan, and, the, pishtaq, a, difference, to, note, is, the, appearance, of, mosques, without, domes, as, in, the, past, mosques, for, the, most, part, all, had, them, but, these, new, dome, less, mosques, seem, to, follow, a, function, over, form, design, and, are, created, by, those, not, of, the, islamic, faith, in, most, cases, the, influence, of, islam, still, pervades, the, style, of, creation, itself, and, provides, a, conceptual, framework, for, the, making, of, a, building, that, exemplifies, the, styles, and, beliefs, of, islam, it, has, also, been, influenced, by, the, now, meeting, of, many, different, cultures, such, as, european, styles, meeting, islamic, styles, leading, to, islamic, architects, incorporating, features, of, other, architectural, and, cultural, styles, urban, design, and, the, tradition, of, islamic, styled, architecture, have, begun, to, combine, to, form, a, new, neo, islamic, style, where, the, efficiency, of, the, urban, style, meshes, with, the, spirituality, and, aesthetic, characteristics, of, islamic, styles, islamic, architecture, in, itself, is, a, style, that, showcases, the, values, and, the, culture, of, islam, but, in, modern, times, sticking, to, tradition, is, falling, out, of, practice, so, a, combination, style, formed, examples, showing, this, are, places, such, as, the, marrakesh, menara, airport, the, islamic, cultural, center, and, museum, of, tolerance, masjid, permata, qolbu, the, concept, for, the, vanishing, mosque, and, the, mazar, e, quaid, all, of, these, buildings, show, the, influence, of, islam, over, them, but, also, the, movements, of, things, like, minimalism, which, are, rising, to, popularity, in, the, architectural, field, designers, that, use, the, aspects, of, both, modern, styles, and, the, islamic, styles, found, a, way, to, have, the, western, inspired, modernism, with, the, classical, cultural, aspects, of, islamic, architecture, this, concept, though, brings, up, the, controversy, of, the, identity, of, the, islamic, community, of, the, traditional, islamic, community, within, a, space, that, doesn, t, follow, the, way, they, knew, it, there, are, some, who, also, debate, whether, islamic, architecture, can, truly, be, called, a, style, as, the, religious, aspect, is, seen, as, separate, and, having, no, bearing, on, the, architectural, style, while, on, the, other, side, people, also, argue, that, the, newfound, trend, and, divergence, from, the, style, of, old, islamic, architecture, is, what, is, causing, the, style, to, lose, its, status, there, are, scholars, that, also, believe, that, the, distinguishing, features, of, the, islamic, architecture, style, were, not, necessarily, found, within, the, architecture, but, were, rather, environmental, markers, such, as, the, sounds, of, prayer, the, city, around, it, the, events, that, occurred, there, the, example, given, is, that, we, can, only, truly, know, that, a, building, is, a, mosque, by, what, happens, there, rather, than, by, visual, cues, specific, features, that, are, notably, related, to, islamic, architecture, the, mihrab, the, minaret, and, the, gate, are, seen, in, multiple, locations, and, do, not, always, serve, the, same, use, and, symbolism, for, being, islamic, in, nature, is, seen, to, be, demonstrated, more, culturally, than, it, is, architecturally, islamic, architecture, is, also, sometimes, referred, to, as, a, hidden, architecture, one, that, doesn, t, necessarily, show, the, physical, traits, of, the, style, rather, it, is, something, that, is, experienced, islamic, architecture, is, a, neglected, subject, within, historical, studies, of, world, architecture, many, scholars, that, study, historical, architecture, often, gloss, over, if, not, completely, ignore, islamic, structures, this, is, caused, by, multiple, elements, one, being, that, there, are, little, historic, literary, works, that, express, an, islamic, architect, s, motives, with, their, structures, due, to, the, wide, geographic, range, of, the, islamic, religion, there, is, a, large, variation, between, thousands, of, existing, mosques, with, little, consistency, between, them, lastly, since, it, is, against, the, islamic, faith, to, idolize, earthly, beings, any, depictions, of, earthly, beings, lack, religious, connection, these, characteristics, combine, to, make, it, difficult, for, historians, to, form, symbolic, connections, from, architecture, in, islamic, places, of, worship, some, authors, have, attempted, to, ascribe, mystical, or, mathematical, symbolisms, to, various, aspects, islamic, architecture, however, while, these, symbolic, meanings, may, be, plausible, for, certain, specific, buildings, they, are, not, necessarily, applicable, to, the, rest, of, islamic, architecture, unlike, christianity, islamic, art, tends, to, not, depict, living, beings, because, it, is, viewed, as, a, conflict, with, the, qur, an, from, an, islamic, viewpoint, anything, created, by, god, is, under, his, order, and, thus, should, not, be, idolized, this, leaves, typical, religious, western, symbols, out, of, the, picture, and, replaces, them, with, an, emphasis, on, complex, geometrical, shapes, and, patterns, there, are, several, aspects, of, islamic, architecture, that, to, modern, knowledge, lack, a, symbolic, religious, meaning, but, there, are, connections, that, do, exist, a, repeated, and, significant, motif, in, mosques, is, calligraphy, calligraphy, plays, a, huge, role, in, delivering, religious, connections, through, artistic, design, calligraphy, in, a, mosque, setting, is, specifically, used, to, reference, excerpts, from, both, the, qur, an, and, muhammad, s, teachings, these, references, are, one, of, the, few, religious, connections, architects, include, within, their, work, islamic, architecture, varies, vastly, across, the, world, specifically, some, mosques, have, different, goals, and, intentions, than, others, these, intentions, often, highlighted, religious, and, social, hierarchies, within, the, mosque, mosques, are, designed, to, have, the, least, significant, portions, of, the, layout, closest, to, the, entrance, as, people, move, deeper, into, the, building, more, significant, religious, areas, are, revealed, hierarchy, is, also, present, because, certain, islamic, architects, are, tasked, to, design, specifically, for, the, presence, of, royalty, although, in, islamic, belief, all, muslims, in, the, mosque, are, equal, designated, locations, had, been, carefully, chosen, in, the, mosque, to, highlight, an, individual, s, position, in, society, this, emphasis, could, be, made, by, being, within, view, to, all, attendees, by, being, placed, in, the, focal, point, of, artistry, or, with, a, maqsurah, maintaining, a, sociological, hierarchy, within, a, mosque, would, typically, represent, a, recognition, by, a, higher, being, aware, of, a, delegation, of, power, this, hierarchy, does, exist, but, not, with, any, sort, of, religious, message, as, hillenbrand, points, out, in, neither, case, is, this, hierarchy, employed, for, especially, portentous, ends, hierarchy, exists, in, the, church, in, different, forms, but, is, meant, for, purely, functional, purposes, deeper, meanings, in, islamic, architecture, often, take, form, as, functional, purposes, for, example, mosques, are, built, around, the, idea, that, it, should, not, just, be, a, place, of, mesmerizing, aesthetics, but, a, place, where, the, aesthetics, fluidity, guide, the, person, into, proper, worship, a, key, feature, of, the, mosque, is, the, mihrab, a, universal, part, of, any, islamic, place, of, worship, the, mihrab, is, easily, identifiable, through, a, receding, wall, and, a, gable, overhead, often, consisting, of, intricate, patterns, upon, entering, the, most, crucial, religious, function, the, architecture, of, the, mosque, serves, to, deliver, is, the, qibla, the, qibla, is, necessary, for, proper, islamic, worship, and, is, revealed, through, architectural, means
