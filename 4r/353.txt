the, recorder, is, a, family, of, woodwind, musical, instruments, in, the, group, known, as, internal, duct, flutes, flutes, with, a, whistle, mouthpiece, also, known, as, fipple, flutes, although, this, is, an, archaic, term, a, recorder, can, be, distinguished, from, other, duct, flutes, by, the, presence, of, a, thumb, hole, for, the, upper, hand, and, seven, finger, holes, three, for, the, upper, hand, and, four, for, the, lower, it, is, the, most, prominent, duct, flute, in, the, western, classical, tradition, recorders, are, made, in, various, sizes, with, names, and, compasses, roughly, corresponding, to, various, vocal, ranges, the, sizes, most, commonly, in, use, today, are, the, soprano, also, known, as, descant, lowest, note, c, 5, alto, also, known, as, treble, lowest, note, f, 4, tenor, lowest, note, c, 4, and, bass, lowest, note, f, 3, recorders, were, traditionally, constructed, from, wood, or, ivory, modern, professional, instruments, are, almost, invariably, of, wood, often, boxwood, student, and, scholastic, recorders, are, commonly, of, moulded, plastic, the, recorders, internal, and, external, proportions, vary, but, the, bore, is, generally, reverse, conical, i, e, tapering, towards, the, foot, to, cylindrical, and, all, recorder, fingering, systems, make, extensive, use, of, forked, fingerings, the, recorder, is, first, documented, in, europe, in, the, middle, ages, and, continued, to, enjoy, wide, popularity, in, the, renaissance, and, baroque, periods, but, was, little, used, in, the, classical, and, romantic, periods, it, was, revived, in, the, twentieth, century, as, part, of, the, historically, informed, performance, movement, and, became, a, popular, amateur, and, educational, instrument, composers, who, have, written, for, the, recorder, include, monteverdi, lully, purcell, handel, vivaldi, telemann, bach, hindemith, and, berio, there, are, many, professional, recorder, players, who, demonstrate, the, full, solo, range, of, the, instrument, and, a, large, community, of, amateurs, the, sound, of, the, recorder, is, often, described, as, clear, and, sweet, and, has, historically, been, associated, with, birds, and, shepherds, it, is, notable, for, its, quick, response, and, its, corresponding, ability, to, produce, a, wide, variety, of, articulations, this, ability, coupled, with, its, open, finger, holes, allow, it, to, produce, a, wide, variety, of, tone, colours, and, special, effects, acoustically, its, tone, is, relatively, pure, and, when, the, edge, is, positioned, in, the, center, of, the, airjet, odd, harmonics, predominate, in, its, sound, when, the, edge, is, decidedly, off, center, an, even, distribution, of, harmonics, occurs, the, instrument, has, been, known, by, its, modern, english, name, at, least, since, the, fourteenth, century, david, lasocki, reports, the, earliest, use, of, recorder, in, the, household, accounts, of, the, earl, of, derby, later, king, henry, iv, in, 1388, which, register, i, fistula, nomine, recordour, one, pipe, called, recordour, by, the, fifteenth, century, the, name, had, appeared, in, english, literature, the, earliest, references, are, in, john, lydgate, s, temple, of, glas, c, 1430, these, lytylle, herdegromys, floutyn, al, the, longe, day, in, here, smale, recorderys, in, floutys, these, little, shepherds, fluting, all, day, long, on, these, small, recorders, on, flutes, and, in, lydgate, s, fall, of, princes, c, 1431, 1438, pan, god, off, kynde, with, his, pipes, seuene, off, recorderis, fond, first, the, melodies, pan, god, of, nature, with, his, pipes, seven, of, recorders, found, first, the, melodies, the, instrument, name, recorder, derives, from, the, latin, record, r, to, call, to, mind, remember, recollect, by, way, of, middle, french, recorder, before, 1349, to, remember, to, learn, by, heart, repeat, relate, recite, play, music, and, its, derivative, recordeur, c, 1395, one, who, retells, a, minstrel, the, association, between, the, various, seemingly, disparate, meanings, of, recorder, can, be, attributed, to, the, role, of, the, medieval, jongleur, in, learning, poems, by, heart, and, later, reciting, them, sometimes, with, musical, accompaniment, the, english, verb, record, from, middle, french, recorder, early, thirteenth, century, meant, to, learn, by, heart, to, commit, to, memory, to, go, over, in, one, s, mind, to, recite, but, it, was, not, used, in, english, to, refer, to, playing, music, until, the, sixteenth, century, when, it, gained, the, meaning, silently, practicing, a, tune, or, sing, or, render, in, song, both, almost, exclusively, referring, to, songbirds, long, after, the, recorder, had, been, named, the, name, of, the, instrument, is, also, uniquely, english, in, middle, french, there, is, no, equivalent, noun, sense, of, recorder, referring, to, a, musical, instrument, partridge, indicates, that, the, use, of, the, instrument, by, jongleurs, led, to, its, association, with, the, verb, recorder, the, minstrel, s, action, a, recorder, the, minstrel, s, tool, the, reason, this, instrument, is, known, as, the, recorder, but, not, one, of, the, other, instruments, played, by, the, jongleurs, is, uncertain, the, introduction, of, the, baroque, recorder, to, england, by, a, group, of, french, professionals, in, 1673, popularised, the, french, name, for, the, instrument, flute, douce, or, simply, flute, a, name, previously, and, subsequently, reserved, for, the, transverse, instrument, until, about, 1695, the, names, recorder, and, flute, overlapped, but, from, 1673, to, the, late, 1720s, in, england, the, word, flute, always, meant, recorder, in, the, 1720s, as, the, transverse, flute, overtook, the, recorder, in, popularity, english, adopted, the, convention, already, present, in, other, european, languages, of, qualifying, the, word, flute, calling, the, recorder, variously, the, common, flute, common, english, flute, or, simply, english, flute, while, the, transverse, instrument, was, distinguished, as, the, german, flute, or, simply, flute, until, at, least, 1765, some, writers, still, used, flute, to, mean, recorder, until, the, mid, eighteenth, century, musical, scores, written, in, italian, refer, to, the, instrument, as, flauto, whereas, the, transverse, instrument, was, called, flauto, traverso, this, distinction, like, the, english, switch, from, recorder, to, flute, has, caused, confusion, among, modern, editors, writers, and, performers, indeed, in, most, european, languages, the, first, term, for, the, recorder, was, the, word, for, flute, alone, in, the, present, day, cognates, of, the, word, flute, when, used, without, qualifiers, remain, ambiguous, and, may, refer, to, either, the, recorder, the, modern, concert, flute, or, other, non, western, flutes, starting, in, the, 1530s, these, languages, began, to, add, qualifiers, to, specify, this, particular, flute, since, the, fifteenth, century, a, variety, of, sizes, of, recorder, have, been, documented, but, a, consistent, terminology, and, notation, for, the, different, sizes, was, not, formulated, until, the, twentieth, century, today, recorder, sizes, are, named, after, the, different, vocal, ranges, this, is, not, however, a, reflection, of, sounding, pitch, and, serves, primarily, to, denote, the, pitch, relationships, between, the, different, instruments, groups, of, recorders, played, together, are, referred, to, as, consorts, recorders, are, also, often, referred, to, by, their, lowest, sounding, note, recorder, in, f, refers, to, a, recorder, with, lowest, note, f, in, any, octave, the, table, in, this, section, shows, the, standard, names, of, modern, recorders, in, f, and, c, and, their, respective, ranges, music, composed, after, the, modern, revival, of, the, recorder, most, frequently, uses, soprano, alto, tenor, and, bass, recorders, although, sopranino, and, great, bass, are, also, fairly, common, consorts, of, recorders, are, often, referred, to, using, the, terminology, of, organ, registers, 8, 8, foot, pitch, referring, to, a, consort, sounding, as, written, 4, pitch, a, consort, sounding, an, octave, above, written, and, 16, a, consort, sounding, an, octave, below, written, the, combination, of, these, consorts, is, also, possible, as, a, rule, of, thumb, the, tessitura, of, a, baroque, recorder, lies, approximately, one, octave, above, the, tessitura, of, the, human, voice, type, after, which, it, is, named, for, example, the, tessitura, of, a, soprano, voice, is, roughly, c, 4, c, 6, while, the, tessitura, of, a, soprano, recorder, is, c, 5, c, 7, modern, variations, include, standard, british, terminology, due, to, arnold, dolmetsch, which, refers, to, the, recorder, in, c, 5, soprano, as, the, descant, and, the, recorder, in, f, 4, alto, as, the, treble, as, conventions, and, instruments, vary, especially, for, larger, and, more, uncommon, instruments, it, is, often, practical, to, state, the, recorder, s, lowest, note, along, with, its, name, to, avoid, confusion, modern, recorder, parts, are, notated, in, the, key, they, sound, in, parts, for, alto, tenor, and, contrabass, recorders, are, notated, at, pitch, while, parts, for, sopranino, soprano, bass, and, great, bass, are, typically, notated, an, octave, below, their, sounding, pitch, as, a, result, soprano, and, tenor, recorders, are, notated, identically, alto, and, sopranino, are, notated, identically, and, bass, and, contrabass, recorders, are, notated, identically, octave, clefs, may, be, used, to, indicate, the, sounding, pitch, but, usage, is, inconsistent, rare, sizes, and, notations, include, the, garklein, flutlein, which, may, be, notated, two, octaves, below, its, sounding, pitch, and, the, sub, contrabass, which, may, be, notated, an, octave, above, its, sounding, pitch, the, earliest, known, document, mentioning, a, pipe, called, recordour, dates, from, 1388, historically, recorders, were, used, to, play, vocal, music, and, parts, written, for, other, instruments, or, for, a, general, instrument, as, a, result, it, was, frequently, the, performers, responsibility, to, read, parts, not, specifically, intended, for, the, instrument, and, to, choose, appropriate, instruments, when, such, consorts, consisted, only, of, recorders, the, pitch, relationships, between, the, parts, were, typically, preserved, but, when, recorders, were, combined, with, other, instruments, octave, discrepancies, were, often, ignored, recorder, consorts, in, the, sixteenth, century, were, tuned, in, fifths, and, only, occasionally, employed, tuning, by, octaves, as, seen, in, the, modern, c, f, recorder, consort, this, means, that, consorts, could, be, composed, of, instruments, nominally, in, b, f, c, g, d, a, and, even, e, although, typically, only, three, or, four, distinct, sizes, were, used, simultaneously, to, use, modern, terminology, these, recorders, were, treated, as, transposing, instruments, consorts, would, be, read, identically, to, a, consort, made, up, of, f, 3, c, 4, and, g, 4, instruments, this, is, made, possible, by, the, fact, that, adjacent, sizes, are, separated, by, fifths, with, few, exceptions, these, parts, would, be, written, using, chiavi, naturali, allowing, the, parts, to, roughly, fit, in, the, range, of, a, single, staff, and, also, in, the, range, of, the, recorders, of, the, period, see, renaissance, structure, transpositions, registers, such, as, c, 3, g, 3, d, 4, g, 3, d, 4, a, 4, or, b, 2, f, 3, c, 4, all, read, as, f, 3, c, 4, g, 4, instruments, were, possible, as, described, by, praetorius, in, his, syntagma, musicum, three, sizes, of, instruments, could, be, used, to, play, four, part, music, by, doubling, the, middle, size, e, g, f, 3, c, 4, c, 4, g, 4, or, play, six, part, music, by, doubling, the, upper, size, and, tripling, the, middle, size, e, g, f, 3, c, 4, c, 4, c, 4, g, 4, g, 4, modern, nomenclature, for, such, recorders, refers, to, the, instruments, relationship, to, the, other, members, of, consort, rather, than, their, absolute, pitch, which, may, vary, the, instruments, from, lowest, to, highest, are, called, great, bass, bass, basset, tenor, alto, and, soprano, potential, sizes, include, great, bass, in, f, 2, bass, in, b, 2, or, c, 3, basset, in, f, 3, or, g, 3, tenor, in, b, 3, c, 4, or, d, 4, alto, in, f, 4, g, 4, or, a, 4, and, soprano, in, c, 5, or, d, 5, the, alto, in, f, 4, is, the, standard, recorder, of, the, baroque, although, there, is, a, small, repertoire, written, for, other, sizes, in, seventeenth, century, england, smaller, recorders, were, named, for, their, relationship, to, the, alto, and, notated, as, transposing, instruments, with, respect, to, it, third, flute, a, 4, fifth, flute, soprano, c, 5, sixth, flute, d, 5, and, octave, flute, sopranino, f, 5, the, term, flute, du, quart, or, fourth, flute, b, 4, was, used, by, charles, dieupart, although, curiously, he, treated, it, as, a, transposing, instrument, in, relation, to, the, soprano, rather, than, the, alto, in, germanic, countries, the, equivalent, of, the, same, term, quartfl, te, was, applied, both, to, the, tenor, in, c, 4, the, interval, being, measured, down, from, the, alto, in, f, 4, and, to, a, recorder, in, c, 5, soprano, the, interval, of, a, fourth, apparently, being, measured, up, from, an, alto, in, g, 4, recorder, parts, in, the, baroque, were, typically, notated, using, the, treble, clef, although, they, may, also, be, notated, in, french, violin, clef, g, clef, on, the, bottom, line, of, the, staff, in, modern, usage, recorders, not, in, c, or, f, are, alternatively, referred, to, using, the, name, of, the, closest, instrument, in, c, or, f, followed, by, the, lowest, note, for, example, a, recorder, with, lowest, note, g, 4, may, be, known, as, a, g, alto, or, alto, in, g, a, recorder, with, lowest, note, d, 5, also, sixth, flute, as, a, d, soprano, or, soprano, in, d, and, a, recorder, in, g, 3, as, a, g, bass, or, g, basset, this, usage, is, not, totally, consistent, notably, the, baroque, recorder, in, d, 4, is, not, commonly, referred, to, as, a, d, tenor, nor, a, d, alto, it, is, most, commonly, referred, to, using, the, historical, name, voice, flute, recorders, have, historically, been, constructed, from, hardwoods, and, ivory, sometimes, with, metal, keys, since, the, modern, revival, of, the, recorder, plastics, have, been, used, in, the, mass, manufacture, of, recorders, as, well, as, by, a, few, individual, makers, today, a, wide, variety, of, hardwoods, are, used, to, make, recorder, bodies, relatively, fewer, varieties, of, wood, are, used, to, make, recorder, blocks, which, are, often, made, of, red, cedar, chosen, because, of, its, rot, resistance, ability, to, absorb, water, and, low, expansion, when, wet, a, recent, innovation, is, the, use, of, synthetic, ceramics, in, the, manufacture, of, recorder, blocks, some, recorders, have, tone, holes, too, far, apart, for, a, player, s, hands, to, reach, or, too, large, to, cover, with, the, pads, of, the, fingers, in, either, case, more, ergonomically, placed, keys, can, be, used, to, cover, the, tone, holes, keys, also, allow, the, design, of, longer, instruments, with, larger, tone, holes, keys, are, most, common, in, recorders, larger, than, the, alto, instruments, larger, than, the, tenor, need, at, least, one, key, so, the, player, can, cover, all, eight, holes, keys, are, sometimes, also, used, on, smaller, recorders, to, allow, for, comfortable, hand, stretch, and, acoustically, improved, hole, placement, and, size, when, playing, a, larger, recorder, a, player, may, not, be, able, to, simultaneously, reach, the, keys, or, tone, holes, with, the, fingers, and, reach, the, windway, with, the, mouth, in, this, case, a, bocal, may, be, used, to, allow, the, player, to, blow, into, the, recorder, while, maintaining, a, comfortable, hand, position, alternatively, some, recorders, have, a, bent, bore, that, positions, the, windway, closer, to, the, keys, or, finger, holes, so, the, player, can, comfortably, reach, both, instruments, with, a, single, bend, are, known, as, knick, or, bent, neck, recorders, some, newer, designs, of, recorder, are, now, being, produced, recorders, with, a, square, cross, section, may, be, produced, more, cheaply, and, in, larger, sizes, than, comparable, recorders, manufactured, by, turning, another, area, is, the, development, of, instruments, with, a, greater, dynamic, range, and, more, powerful, bottom, notes, these, modern, designs, make, it, easier, to, be, heard, in, concertos, finally, recorders, with, a, downward, extension, of, a, semitone, are, becoming, available, such, instruments, can, play, a, full, three, octaves, in, tune, in, the, early, twentieth, century, peter, harlan, developed, a, recorder, with, apparently, simpler, fingering, called, german, fingering, a, recorder, designed, for, german, fingering, has, a, hole, five, that, is, smaller, than, hole, four, whereas, baroque, and, neo, baroque, recorders, have, a, hole, four, that, is, smaller, than, hole, five, the, immediate, difference, in, fingering, is, for, f, soprano, or, b, alto, which, on, a, neo, baroque, instrument, must, be, fingered, 0, 123, 4, 67, with, german, fingering, this, becomes, a, simpler, 0, 123, 4, unfortunately, however, this, makes, many, other, chromatic, notes, too, out, of, tune, to, be, usable, german, fingering, became, popular, in, europe, especially, germany, in, the, 1930s, but, rapidly, became, obsolete, in, the, 1950s, as, people, began, to, treat, the, recorder, more, seriously, and, the, limitations, of, german, fingering, became, more, widely, appreciated, recorders, with, german, fingering, are, today, manufactured, exclusively, for, educational, purposes, modern, recorders, are, most, commonly, pitched, at, a, 440, hz, but, among, serious, amateurs, and, professionals, other, pitch, standards, are, often, found, for, the, performance, of, baroque, music, a, 415, hz, is, the, de, facto, standard, while, pre, baroque, music, is, often, performed, at, a, 440, hz, or, a, 466, hz, these, pitch, standards, are, intended, to, reflect, the, broad, variation, in, pitch, standards, throughout, the, history, of, the, recorder, in, various, regions, contexts, and, time, periods, pitch, standards, have, varied, from, a, 392, hz, to, a, 520, hz, the, pitches, a, 415, hz, and, a, 466, hz, a, semitone, lower, and, a, semitone, higher, than, a, 440, hz, respectively, were, chosen, because, they, may, be, used, with, harpsichords, or, chamber, organs, that, transpose, up, or, down, a, semitone, from, a, 440, these, pitch, standards, allow, recorder, players, to, collaborate, with, other, instrumentalists, at, a, pitch, other, than, a, 440, hz, some, recorder, makers, produce, instruments, at, pitches, other, than, the, three, standard, pitches, above, and, recorders, with, interchangeable, bodies, at, different, pitches, the, recorder, produces, sound, in, the, manner, of, a, whistle, or, an, organ, flue, pipe, in, normal, play, the, player, blows, into, the, windway, b, a, narrow, channel, in, the, head, joint, which, directs, a, stream, of, air, across, a, gap, called, the, window, at, a, sharp, edge, called, the, labium, c, the, air, stream, alternately, travels, above, and, below, the, labium, exciting, standing, waves, in, the, bore, of, the, recorder, and, producing, sound, waves, that, emanate, away, from, the, window, feedback, from, the, resonance, of, the, tube, regulates, the, pitch, of, the, sound, in, recorders, as, in, all, woodwind, instruments, the, air, column, inside, the, instrument, behaves, like, a, vibrating, string, to, use, a, musical, analogy, and, has, multiple, modes, of, vibration, these, waves, produced, inside, the, instrument, are, not, travelling, waves, like, those, the, ear, perceives, as, sound, but, rather, stationary, standing, waves, consisting, of, areas, of, high, pressure, and, low, pressure, inside, the, tube, called, nodes, the, perceived, pitch, is, the, lowest, and, typically, loudest, mode, of, vibration, in, the, air, column, the, other, pitches, are, harmonics, or, overtones, players, typically, describe, recorder, pitches, by, the, number, of, nodes, in, the, air, column, notes, with, a, single, node, are, in, the, first, register, notes, with, two, nodes, in, the, second, register, etc, as, the, number, of, nodes, in, the, tube, increases, the, number, of, notes, a, player, can, produce, in, a, given, register, decreases, because, of, the, physical, constraint, of, the, spacing, of, the, nodes, in, the, bore, on, a, baroque, recorder, the, first, second, and, third, registers, span, about, a, major, ninth, a, major, sixth, and, a, minor, third, respectively, the, recorder, sound, for, the, most, part, lacks, high, harmonics, and, odd, harmonics, predominate, in, its, sound, with, the, even, harmonics, being, almost, entirely, absent, although, the, harmonic, profile, of, the, recorder, sound, varies, from, recorder, to, recorder, and, from, fingering, to, fingering, as, a, result, of, the, lack, of, high, harmonics, writers, since, praetorius, have, remarked, that, it, is, difficult, for, the, human, ear, to, perceive, correctly, the, sounding, octave, of, the, recorder, as, in, organ, flue, pipes, the, sounding, pitch, of, duct, type, whistles, is, affected, by, the, velocity, of, the, air, stream, as, it, impinges, upon, the, labium, the, pitch, generally, increases, with, velocity, of, the, airstream, up, to, a, point, air, speed, can, also, be, used, to, influence, the, number, of, pressure, nodes, in, a, process, called, over, blowing, at, higher, airstream, velocities, lower, modes, of, vibration, of, the, air, column, become, unstable, resulting, in, a, change, of, register, the, air, stream, is, affected, by, the, shaping, of, the, surfaces, in, the, head, of, the, recorder, the, voicing, and, the, way, the, player, blows, air, into, the, windway, recorder, voicing, is, determined, by, physical, parameters, such, as, the, proportions, and, curvature, of, the, windway, along, both, the, longitudinal, and, latitudinal, axes, the, bevelled, edges, chamfers, of, the, windway, facing, towards, the, labium, the, length, of, the, window, the, sharpness, of, the, labium, i, e, the, steepness, of, the, ramp, among, other, parameters, the, player, is, able, to, control, the, speed, and, turbulence, of, the, airstream, using, the, diaphragm, and, vocal, tract, the, finger, holes, used, in, combination, or, partially, covered, affect, the, sounding, pitch, of, the, instrument, at, the, most, basic, level, the, sequential, uncovering, of, finger, holes, increases, the, sounding, pitch, of, the, instrument, by, decreasing, the, effective, sounding, length, of, the, instrument, and, vice, versa, for, the, sequential, covering, of, holes, in, the, fingering, 01234567, only, the, bell, of, the, instrument, is, open, resulting, in, a, low, pressure, node, at, the, bell, end, of, the, instrument, the, fingering, 0123456, sounds, at, a, higher, pitch, because, the, seventh, hole, and, the, bell, both, release, air, creating, a, low, pressure, node, at, the, seventh, hole, besides, sequential, uncovering, recorders, can, use, forked, fingering, to, produce, tones, other, than, those, produced, by, simple, sequential, lifting, of, fingers, in, the, fingering, 0123, air, leaks, from, the, open, holes, 4, 5, 6, and, 7, the, pressure, inside, the, bore, is, higher, at, the, fourth, hole, than, at, the, fifth, and, decreases, further, at, the, 6th, and, 7th, holes, consequently, the, most, air, leaks, from, the, fourth, hole, and, the, least, air, leaks, from, the, seventh, hole, as, a, result, covering, the, fourth, hole, affects, the, pitch, more, than, covering, any, of, the, holes, below, it, thus, at, the, same, air, pressure, the, fingering, 01235, produces, a, pitch, between, 0123, and, 01234, forked, fingerings, allow, recorder, players, to, obtain, fine, gradations, in, pitch, and, timbre, a, recorder, s, pitch, is, also, affected, by, the, partial, covering, of, holes, this, technique, is, an, important, tool, for, intonation, and, is, related, to, the, fixed, process, of, tuning, a, recorder, which, involves, the, adjustment, of, the, size, and, shape, of, the, finger, holes, through, carving, and, the, application, of, wax, one, essential, use, of, partial, covering, is, in, leaking, or, partially, covering, the, thumb, hole, to, destabilise, low, harmonics, this, allows, higher, harmonics, to, sound, at, lower, air, pressures, than, by, over, blowing, alone, as, on, simple, whistles, the, player, may, also, leak, other, holes, to, destabilise, lower, harmonics, in, place, of, the, thumb, hole, hole, 0, this, technique, is, demonstrated, in, the, fingering, tables, of, ganassi, s, fontegara, 1535, which, illustrate, the, simultaneous, leaking, of, holes, 0, 2, and, 5, to, produce, some, high, notes, for, example, ganassi, s, table, produces, the, 15th, third, octave, tonic, as, the, fourth, harmonic, of, the, tonic, leaking, holes, 0, 2, and, 5, and, produces, the, 16th, as, the, third, harmonic, of, the, fifth, leaking, holes, 0, and, 2, on, some, baroque, recorders, the, 17th, can, be, produced, as, the, third, harmonic, of, the, sixth, leaking, hole, 0, as, well, as, hole, 1, 2, or, both, although, the, design, of, the, recorder, has, changed, over, its, 700, year, history, notably, in, fingering, and, bore, profile, see, history, the, technique, of, playing, recorders, of, different, sizes, and, periods, is, much, the, same, indeed, much, of, what, is, known, about, the, technique, of, playing, the, recorder, is, derived, from, historical, treatises, and, manuals, dating, from, the, sixteenth, to, eighteenth, centuries, the, following, describes, the, commonalities, of, recorder, technique, across, all, time, periods, in, normal, playing, position, the, recorder, is, held, with, both, hands, covering, the, fingerholes, or, depressing, the, keys, with, the, pads, of, the, fingers, four, fingers, on, the, lower, hand, and, the, index, middle, and, ring, fingers, and, thumb, on, the, upper, hand, in, standard, modern, practice, the, right, hand, is, the, lower, hand, while, the, left, hand, is, the, upper, hand, although, this, was, not, standardised, before, the, modern, revival, of, the, recorder, the, recorder, is, supported, by, the, lips, which, loosely, seal, around, the, beak, of, the, instrument, the, thumb, of, the, lower, hand, and, depending, on, the, note, fingered, by, the, other, fingers, and, the, upper, thumb, a, practice, documented, in, many, historical, fingering, charts, is, the, use, of, finger, seven, or, eight, to, support, the, recorder, when, playing, notes, for, which, the, coverage, of, this, hole, negligibly, affects, the, sounding, pitch, e, g, notes, with, many, holes, uncovered, larger, recorders, may, have, a, thumb, rest, or, a, neck, strap, for, extra, support, and, may, use, a, bocal, to, direct, air, from, the, player, s, mouth, to, the, windway, recorders, are, typically, held, at, an, angle, between, vertical, and, horizontal, the, attitude, depending, on, the, size, and, weight, of, the, recorder, and, personal, preference, pitches, are, produced, on, the, recorder, by, covering, the, holes, while, blowing, into, the, instrument, modern, terminology, refers, to, the, holes, on, the, front, of, the, instrument, using, the, numbers, 1, through, 7, starting, with, the, hole, closest, to, the, beak, with, the, thumbhole, numbered, hole, 0, at, the, most, basic, level, the, fingering, technique, of, the, recorder, involves, the, sequential, uncovering, of, the, holes, from, lowest, to, highest, i, e, uncovering, 7, then, uncovering, 7, and, 6, then, uncovering, 7, 6, and, 5, etc, producing, even, higher, pitches, in, practice, however, the, uncovering, of, the, holes, is, not, strictly, sequential, and, the, half, covering, or, uncovering, of, holes, is, an, essential, part, of, recorder, technique, a, forked, fingering, is, a, fingering, in, which, an, open, hole, has, covered, holes, below, it, fingerings, for, which, the, uncovering, of, the, holes, is, not, sequential, for, example, the, fingering, 0123, g, 5, is, not, a, forked, fingering, while, 0123, 56, f, 5, is, a, forked, fingering, because, the, open, hole, 4, has, holes, covered, below, it, holes, 5, and, 6, forked, fingerings, allow, for, smaller, adjustments, in, pitch, than, the, sequential, uncovering, of, holes, alone, would, allow, for, example, at, the, same, air, speed, the, fingering, 0123, 5, sounds, higher, than, 01234, but, lower, than, 0123, many, standard, recorder, fingerings, are, forked, fingerings, forked, fingerings, may, also, be, used, to, produce, microtonal, variations, in, pitch, forked, fingerings, have, a, different, harmonic, profile, from, non, forked, fingerings, and, are, generally, regarded, as, having, a, weaker, sound, forked, fingerings, that, have, a, different, tone, color, or, are, slightly, sharp, or, flat, can, provide, so, called, alternate, fingerings, for, example, the, fingering, 0123, has, a, slightly, sharper, forked, variant, 012, 4567, partial, covering, of, the, holes, is, an, essential, part, of, the, playing, technique, of, all, recorders, this, is, variously, known, as, leaking, shading, half, holing, and, in, the, context, of, the, thumb, hole, pinching, the, primary, function, of, the, thumbhole, is, to, serve, as, an, octaving, vent, when, it, is, leaked, the, first, mode, of, vibration, of, the, air, column, becomes, unstable, i, e, the, register, changes, in, most, recorders, this, is, required, for, the, playing, of, every, note, higher, than, a, ninth, above, the, lowest, note, the, player, must, adjust, the, position, of, the, thumb, for, these, notes, to, sound, stable, and, in, tune, the, partial, opening, of, the, thumbhole, may, be, achieved, by, sliding, or, rolling, the, thumb, off, the, hole, or, by, bending, the, thumb, at, the, first, knuckle, to, partially, uncover, a, covered, hole, the, player, may, slide, the, finger, off, the, hole, bend, or, roll, the, finger, away, from, the, hole, gently, lift, the, finger, from, the, hole, or, a, combination, of, these, to, partially, cover, an, open, hole, the, reverse, is, possible, generally, speaking, the, partial, opening, of, covered, fingerholes, raises, the, pitch, of, the, sounding, note, while, the, partial, closure, of, open, fingerholes, lowers, the, pitch, on, most, baroque, modelled, modern, recorders, the, lower, two, fingers, of, the, lower, hand, actually, cover, two, holes, each, called, double, holes, whereas, on, the, vast, majority, of, baroque, recorders, and, all, earlier, recorders, these, two, fingers, covered, a, single, hole, single, holes, double, holes, have, become, standard, for, baroque, modelled, modern, recorders, by, covering, one, or, both, of, these, two, smaller, holes, a, recorder, player, can, play, the, notes, a, semitone, above, the, lowest, note, and, a, minor, third, above, the, lowest, note, notes, that, are, possible, on, single, holed, recorders, only, through, the, partial, covering, of, those, holes, or, the, covering, of, the, bell, the, open, end, of, the, bore, facing, away, from, the, player, the, bell, may, be, covered, to, produce, extra, notes, or, effects, because, both, hands, are, typically, engaged, in, holding, the, recorder, or, covering, the, finger, holes, the, covering, of, the, bell, is, normally, achieved, by, bringing, the, end, of, the, recorder, in, contact, with, the, leg, or, knee, typically, achieved, through, a, combination, of, bending, of, the, torso, and, or, raising, of, the, knee, alternatively, in, rare, cases, instruments, may, be, equipped, with, a, key, designed, to, cover, the, bell, bell, key, operated, by, one, of, the, fingers, typically, the, pinky, finger, of, the, upper, hand, which, is, not, normally, used, to, cover, a, hole, fingerings, with, a, covered, bell, extend, the, recorder, s, chromatic, playable, range, above, and, below, the, nominal, fingered, range, the, pitch, and, volume, of, the, recorder, sound, are, influenced, by, the, speed, of, the, air, travelling, through, the, windway, which, may, be, controlled, by, varying, the, breath, pressure, and, the, shape, of, the, vocal, tract, the, sound, is, also, affected, by, the, turbulence, of, the, air, entering, the, recorder, generally, speaking, faster, air, in, the, windway, produces, a, higher, pitch, thus, blowing, harder, causes, a, note, to, sound, sharp, whereas, blowing, the, note, gently, causes, it, to, sound, flat, knowledge, of, this, fact, and, the, recorder, s, individual, tonal, differences, over, its, full, range, will, help, recorders, play, in, tune, with, other, instruments, by, knowing, which, notes, will, need, slightly, more, or, less, air, to, stay, in, tune, as, mentioned, above, at, harmonic, profile, blowing, much, harder, can, result, in, overblowing, the, technique, of, inhalation, and, exhalation, for, the, recorder, differs, from, that, of, many, other, wind, instruments, in, that, the, recorder, requires, very, little, air, pressure, to, produce, a, sound, unlike, reed, or, brasswind, instruments, thus, it, is, often, necessary, for, a, recorder, player, to, produce, long, controlled, streams, of, air, at, a, very, low, pressure, recorder, breathing, technique, focuses, on, the, controlled, release, of, air, rather, than, on, maintaining, diaphragmatic, pressure, the, use, of, the, tongue, to, stop, and, start, the, air, is, called, articulation, in, this, capacity, the, tongue, has, two, basic, functions, to, control, the, start, of, the, note, the, attack, and, the, end, or, the, length, of, the, note, legato, staccato, articulations, are, roughly, analogous, to, consonants, practically, any, consonant, that, may, be, produced, with, the, tongue, mouth, and, throat, may, be, used, to, articulate, on, the, recorder, transliterations, of, common, articulation, patterns, include, du, du, du, du, using, the, tip, of, the, tongue, single, tonguing, du, gu, du, gu, alternating, between, the, tip, and, the, back, of, the, tongue, double, tonguing, and, du, g, ll, du, g, ll, articulation, with, the, tip, and, the, sides, of, the, tongue, triple, tonguing, the, attack, of, the, note, is, governed, by, such, factors, as, the, pressure, buildup, behind, the, tongue, and, shape, of, the, articulant, while, the, length, of, the, note, governed, by, the, stoppage, of, the, air, by, the, tongue, each, articulation, pattern, has, a, different, natural, pattern, of, attack, and, length, and, recorder, technique, seeks, to, produce, a, wide, variety, of, lengths, and, attacks, using, these, articulation, patterns, patterns, such, as, these, have, been, used, since, at, least, the, time, of, ganassi, 1535, mouth, and, throat, shapes, are, roughly, analogous, to, vowels, the, shape, of, the, vocal, tract, affects, the, velocity, and, turbulence, of, the, air, entering, the, recorder, the, shape, of, the, mouth, and, vocal, tract, is, closely, related, to, the, consonant, used, to, articulate, the, player, must, coordinate, fingers, and, tongue, to, align, articulations, with, finger, movements, in, normal, play, articulated, attacks, should, align, with, the, proper, fingering, even, in, legato, passages, or, in, difficult, finger, transitions, and, the, fingers, move, in, the, brief, silence, between, the, notes, silence, d, articulation, created, by, the, stoppage, of, the, air, by, the, tongue, both, fingers, and, the, breath, can, be, used, to, control, the, pitch, of, the, recorder, coordinating, the, two, is, essential, to, playing, the, recorder, in, tune, and, with, a, variety, of, dynamics, and, timbres, on, an, elementary, level, breath, pressure, and, fingerings, must, accord, with, each, other, to, provide, an, in, tune, pitch, as, an, example, of, a, more, advanced, form, of, coordination, a, gradual, increase, in, breath, pressure, combined, with, the, shading, of, holes, when, properly, coordinated, results, in, an, increase, in, volume, and, change, in, tone, color, without, a, change, in, pitch, the, reverse, is, possible, decreasing, breath, pressure, and, gradually, lifting, fingers, means, to, cover, the, hole, means, to, uncover, the, hole, means, half, cover, the, range, of, a, modern, baroque, model, recorder, is, usually, considered, two, octaves, and, a, tone, see, the, table, above, for, english, fingerings, for, the, standard, range, the, numbers, at, the, top, correspond, to, the, fingers, and, the, holes, on, the, recorder, the, vast, majority, of, recorders, manufactured, today, are, designed, to, play, using, these, fingerings, with, slight, variations, nonetheless, recorder, fingerings, vary, widely, between, models, and, are, mutable, even, for, a, single, recorder, recorder, players, may, use, three, or, more, fingerings, for, the, same, note, along, with, partial, covering, of, the, holes, to, achieve, proper, intonation, in, coordination, with, the, breath, or, in, faster, passages, where, some, fingerings, are, unavailable, this, chart, is, a, general, guide, but, by, no, means, a, definitive, or, complete, fingering, chart, for, the, recorder, an, impossible, task, rather, it, is, the, basis, for, a, much, more, complex, fingering, system, which, is, still, being, added, to, today, some, fonts, show, miniature, glyphs, of, complete, recorder, fingering, charts, in, truetype, format, because, there, are, no, unicode, values, for, complete, recorder, fingering, charts, these, fonts, are, custom, encoded, the, earliest, extant, duct, flutes, date, to, the, neolithic, they, are, found, in, almost, every, musical, tradition, around, the, world, recorders, are, distinguished, from, other, duct, flutes, primarily, by, the, thumb, hole, which, is, used, as, an, octaving, vent, and, the, presence, of, seven, finger, holes, although, classification, of, early, instruments, has, proved, controversial, the, performing, practice, of, the, recorder, in, its, earliest, history, is, not, well, documented, owing, to, the, lack, of, surviving, records, from, the, time, our, present, knowledge, of, the, structure, of, recorders, in, the, middle, ages, is, based, on, a, small, number, of, instruments, preserved, and, artworks, or, iconography, from, the, period, surviving, instruments, from, the, middle, ages, are, heterogeneous, the, first, medieval, recorder, discovered, was, a, fruitwood, instrument, dordrecht, recorder, excavated, in, 1940, from, a, well, not, a, moat, in, the, ruin, of, the, huis, te, merwede, house, on, the, merwede, near, the, town, of, dordrecht, in, the, netherlands, the, house, was, only, inhabited, from, 1335, to, 1418, as, the, area, was, not, disturbed, until, the, modern, excavation, the, recorder, has, been, dated, to, the, period, of, occupation, the, instrument, has, a, cylindrical, bore, about, 11, mm, 0, 43, in, in, diameter, and, is, about, 300, mm, 12, in, long, with, a, vibrating, air, column, of, about, 270, mm, 11, in, the, block, has, survived, but, the, labium, is, damaged, making, the, instrument, unplayable, the, instrument, has, tenons, on, both, ends, of, the, instrument, suggesting, the, presence, of, now, lost, ferrules, or, turnings, uncertainty, regarding, the, nature, of, these, fittings, has, hindered, reconstruction, of, the, instrument, s, original, state, a, second, structurally, different, instrument, g, ttingen, recorder, was, discovered, in, 1987, in, an, archaeological, excavation, of, the, latrine, of, a, medieval, house, in, g, ttingen, germany, it, has, been, dated, to, between, 1246, and, 1322, it, is, fruitwood, in, one, piece, with, turnings, measuring, about, 256, mm, 10, 1, in, long, it, has, a, cylindrical, bore, about, 13, 6, mm, 0, 54, in, at, the, highest, measurable, point, narrowing, to, 13, 2, mm, 0, 52, in, between, the, first, and, second, finger, holes, to, 12, 7, to, 12, 8, mm, 0, 50, 0, 50, in, between, the, second, and, third, finger, holes, and, contracting, to, 11, 5, mm, 0, 45, in, at, the, seventh, hole, the, bore, expands, to, 14, 5, mm, 0, 57, in, at, the, bottom, of, the, instrument, which, has, a, bulbous, foot, unusually, the, finger, holes, taper, conically, outwards, the, opposite, of, the, undercutting, found, in, baroque, recorders, the, top, of, the, instrument, is, damaged, only, a, cut, side, of, the, windway, survives, and, the, block, has, been, lost, a, reconstruction, by, hans, reiners, has, a, strident, penetrating, sound, rich, in, overtones, and, has, a, range, of, two, octaves, with, the, thumb, hole, and, the, first, three, finger, holes, covered, the, reconstruction, produces, a, pitch, ca, 450, hz, in, the, 21st, century, a, number, of, other, instruments, and, fragments, dated, to, the, medieval, period, have, come, to, light, these, include, a, fourteenth, century, fragment, of, a, headjoint, excavated, in, esslingen, germany, esslingen, fragment, a, birch, instrument, dated, to, the, second, half, of, the, fourteenth, century, unearthed, in, tartu, estonia, tartu, recorder, and, a, fruitwood, instrument, dated, to, the, fifteenth, century, found, in, elbl, g, poland, elbl, g, recorder, common, features, of, the, surviving, instruments, include, a, narrow, cylindrical, bore, except, the, g, ttingen, recorder, a, doubled, seventh, hole, for, the, little, finger, of, the, lower, hand, to, allow, for, right, or, left, handed, playing, except, the, tartu, recorder, a, seventh, hole, that, produces, a, semitone, instead, of, a, tone, and, a, flat, or, truncated, head, instead, of, the, narrow, beak, found, on, later, instruments, additionally, the, esslingen, fragment, has, turnings, similar, to, the, g, ttingen, recorder, no, complete, instruments, larger, than, 300, mm, 12, in, have, survived, although, the, esslingen, fragment, may, represent, a, larger, recorder, the, widely, spaced, doubled, seventh, hole, persisted, in, later, instruments, according, to, virdung, 1511, the, hole, that, was, not, used, was, plugged, with, wax, it, was, not, until, the, baroque, period, when, instruments, with, adjustable, footjoints, were, developed, that, widely, spaced, double, holes, became, obsolete, the, classification, of, these, instruments, is, primarily, complicated, by, the, fact, that, the, seventh, hole, produces, a, semitone, instead, of, a, tone, as, a, result, chromatic, fingerings, are, difficult, and, require, extensive, half, holing, these, instruments, share, similarities, with, the, six, holed, flageolet, which, used, three, fingers, on, each, hand, and, had, no, thumb, hole, anthony, rowland, jones, has, suggested, that, the, thumb, hole, on, these, early, flutes, was, an, improvement, upon, the, flageolet, to, provide, a, stronger, fingering, for, the, note, an, octave, above, the, tonic, while, the, seventh, finger, hole, provided, a, leading, tone, to, the, tonic, as, a, result, he, has, suggested, that, these, flutes, should, be, described, as, improved, flageolets, and, has, proposed, the, condition, that, true, recorders, produce, a, tone, rather, than, a, semitone, when, the, seventh, finger, is, lifted, controversy, aside, there, is, little, question, that, these, instruments, are, at, least, precursors, to, later, instruments, that, are, indisputably, recorders, because, there, is, sparse, documentary, evidence, from, the, earliest, history, of, the, instrument, such, questions, may, never, be, resolved, indeed, historically, there, was, no, need, for, an, all, inclusive, definition, that, encompassed, every, form, of, the, instrument, past, and, present, recorders, with, a, cylindrical, profile, are, depicted, in, many, medieval, paintings, however, their, appearance, does, not, easily, correspond, to, the, surviving, instruments, and, may, be, stylised, the, earliest, depictions, of, the, recorder, are, probably, in, the, mocking, of, christ, from, the, monastery, church, of, st, george, in, staro, nagori, ano, near, kumanovo, macedonia, the, painting, of, the, church, began, in, 1315, in, which, a, man, plays, a, cylindrical, recorder, and, the, center, panel, of, the, virgin, and, child, attributed, to, pedro, pere, serra, c, 1390, painted, for, the, church, of, s, clara, tortosa, now, in, the, museu, nacional, d, art, de, catalunya, barcelona, in, which, a, group, of, angels, play, musical, instruments, around, the, virgin, mary, one, of, them, playing, a, cylindrical, recorder, starting, in, the, middle, ages, angels, have, frequently, been, depicted, playing, one, or, more, recorders, often, grouped, around, the, virgin, and, in, several, notable, paintings, trios, of, angels, play, recorders, this, is, perhaps, a, sign, of, the, trinity, although, the, music, must, have, often, been, in, three, parts, no, music, marked, for, the, recorder, survives, from, prior, to, 1500, groups, of, recorder, players, or, recorder, playing, angels, particularly, trios, are, depicted, in, paintings, from, the, fifteenth, century, indicating, the, recorder, was, used, in, these, configurations, as, well, as, with, other, instruments, some, of, the, earliest, music, must, have, been, vocal, repertory, modern, recorder, players, have, taken, up, the, practice, of, playing, instrumental, music, from, the, period, perhaps, anachronistically, such, as, the, monophonic, estampies, from, the, chansonnier, du, roi, thirteenth, century, add, ms, 29987, fourteenth, or, fifteenth, or, the, codex, faenza, fifteenth, and, have, arranged, keyboard, music, such, as, the, estampies, from, the, robertsbridge, codex, fourteenth, or, the, vocal, works, of, composers, such, as, guillaume, de, machaut, and, johannes, ciconia, for, recorder, ensembles, in, the, sixteenth, century, the, structure, repertoire, and, performing, practice, of, the, recorder, is, better, documented, than, in, prior, epochs, the, recorder, was, one, of, the, most, important, wind, instruments, of, the, renaissance, and, many, instruments, dating, to, the, sixteenth, century, survive, including, some, matched, consorts, this, period, also, produced, the, first, extant, books, describing, the, recorder, including, the, treatises, of, virdung, 1511, agricola, 1529, ganassi, 1535, cardano, c, 1546, jambe, de, fer, 1556, and, praetorius, 1619, nonetheless, understanding, of, the, instrument, and, its, practice, in, this, period, is, still, developing, in, the, sixteenth, century, the, recorder, saw, important, developments, in, its, structure, as, in, the, recorders, of, the, middle, ages, the, etiology, of, these, changes, remains, uncertain, development, was, regional, and, multiple, types, of, recorder, existed, simultaneously, our, knowledge, is, based, on, documentary, sources, and, surviving, instruments, far, more, recorders, survive, from, the, renaissance, than, from, the, middle, ages, most, of, the, surviving, instruments, from, the, period, have, a, wide, cylindrical, bore, from, the, blockline, to, the, uppermost, fingerhole, an, inverted, conical, portion, down, to, around, the, lowest, finger, hole, the, choke, then, a, slight, flare, to, the, bell, externally, they, have, a, curved, shape, similar, to, the, bore, with, a, profile, like, a, stretched, hourglass, their, sound, is, warm, rich, in, harmonics, and, somewhat, introverted, surviving, consorts, of, this, type, identified, by, their, makers, marks, include, those, marked, hier, s, or, hie, s, found, in, vienna, sibiu, and, verona, and, those, marked, with, variations, on, a, rabbit, s, footprint, designated, by, adrian, brown, which, are, dispersed, among, various, museums, the, pitch, of, these, recorders, is, often, generally, grouped, around, a, 466, hz, however, little, pitch, standardisation, existed, in, the, period, this, type, of, recorder, is, described, by, praetorius, in, de, organographia, 1619, a, surviving, consort, by, follows, the, exact, size, configuration, suggested, by, praetorius, stacked, fifths, up, from, the, basset, in, f, 3, and, down, a, fifth, then, a, fourth, to, bass, in, b, 2, and, great, bass, in, f, 2, instruments, marked, hier, s, or, hie, s, are, in, stacked, fifths, from, great, bass, in, f, 2, to, soprano, in, e, 5, many, of, these, instruments, are, pitched, around, a, 440, hz, or, a, 466, hz, although, pitch, varied, regionally, and, between, consorts, the, range, of, this, type, is, normally, an, octave, plus, a, minor, 7th, but, as, remarked, by, praetorius, 1619, and, demonstrated, in, the, fingering, tables, of, ganassi, s, fontegara, 1535, experienced, players, on, particular, instruments, were, capable, of, playing, up, to, a, fourth, or, even, a, seventh, higher, see, documentary, evidence, treatises, their, range, is, more, suitable, for, the, performance, of, vocal, music, rather, than, purely, instrumental, music, this, type, is, the, recorder, typically, referred, to, as, the, normal, renaissance, recorder, however, this, modern, appellation, does, not, fully, capture, the, heterogeneity, of, instruments, of, the, sixteenth, century, another, surviving, renaissance, type, has, a, narrow, cylindrical, bore, and, cylindrical, profile, like, the, medieval, exemplars, but, a, choke, at, the, last, hole, the, earliest, surviving, recorders, of, this, type, were, made, by, the, rafi, family, instrument, makers, active, in, lyons, in, southern, france, in, the, early, sixteenth, century, two, recorders, marked, c, rafi, were, acquired, by, the, accademia, filarmonica, bologna, in, 1546, where, they, remain, today, a, consort, of, recorders,

notably, a, pair, in, brussels, it, is, possible, that, grece, worked, in, the, rafi, workshop, or, was, a, member, of, the, rafi, family, the, pitch, of, the, rafi, grece, instruments, is, around, a, 440, hz, they, have, a, relatively, quiet, sound, with, good, pitch, stability, favouring, dynamic, expression, in, 1556, french, author, philibert, jambe, de, fer, gave, a, set, of, fingerings, for, hybrid, instruments, such, as, the, rafi, and, grece, instruments, that, give, a, range, of, two, octaves, here, the, 15th, was, now, produced, as, on, most, later, recorders, as, a, variant, of, the, 14th, instead, of, as, the, fourth, harmonic, of, the, tonic, as, in, ganassi, s, tables, the, first, two, treatises, of, the, sixteenth, century, show, recorders, that, differ, from, the, surviving, instruments, dating, to, the, century, these, are, sebastian, virdung, s, b, 1465, musica, getutscht, 1511, and, martin, agricola, s, 1486, 1556, similar, musica, instrumentalis, deudsch, 1529, published, in, basel, and, saxony, respectively, musica, getutscht, the, earliest, printed, treatise, on, western, musical, instruments, is, an, extract, of, an, earlier, now, lost, manuscript, treatise, by, virdung, a, chaplain, singer, and, itinerant, musician, the, printed, version, was, written, in, a, vernacular, form, of, early, new, high, german, and, was, aimed, at, wealthy, urban, amateur, musicians, the, title, translates, briefly, as, music, translated, into, german, everything, there, is, to, know, about, made, simple, when, a, topic, become, too, complex, for, virdung, to, discuss, briefly, he, refers, the, reader, to, his, lost, larger, work, an, unhelpful, practice, for, modern, readers, while, the, illustrations, have, been, called, maddeningly, inaccurate, and, his, perspectives, quirky, virdung, s, treatise, gives, us, an, important, source, on, the, structure, and, performing, practice, of, the, recorder, in, northern, europe, in, the, late, fifteenth, and, early, sixteenth, centuries, the, recorders, described, by, virdung, have, cylindrical, profiles, with, flat, heads, narrow, windows, and, long, ramps, ring, like, turnings, on, the, feet, and, a, slight, external, flare, at, the, bell, above, far, left, and, middle, left, virdung, depicts, four, recorders, together, a, ba, contra, or, bassus, basset, in, f, 3, with, an, anchor, shaped, key, and, a, perforated, fontanelle, two, tenors, in, c, 4, and, a, discantus, alto, in, g, 4, according, to, virdung, the, configurations, f, c, c, g, or, f, c, g, g, should, be, used, for, four, part, music, depending, on, the, range, of, the, bass, part, as, previously, mentioned, the, accuracy, of, these, woodcuts, cannot, be, verified, as, no, recorders, fitting, this, description, survive, virdung, also, provides, the, first, ever, fingering, chart, for, a, recorder, with, a, range, of, an, octave, and, a, seventh, though, he, says, that, the, bass, had, a, range, of, only, an, octave, and, sixth, in, his, fingering, chart, he, numbers, which, fingers, to, lift, rather, than, those, to, put, down, and, unlike, in, later, charts, numbers, them, from, bottom, 1, to, top, 8, his, only, other, technical, instruction, is, that, the, player, must, blow, into, the, instrument, and, learn, how, to, coordinate, the, articulations, with, the, fingers, martin, agricola, s, musica, instrumentalis, deudsch, a, german, instrumental, music, in, which, is, contained, how, to, learn, to, play, all, kinds, of, instruments, written, in, rhyming, german, verse, ostensibly, to, improve, the, understanding, and, retention, of, its, contents, provides, a, similar, account, and, copies, most, of, its, woodcuts, directly, from, getutscht, agricola, also, calls, the, tenor, altus, mistakenly, depicting, it, as, a, little, smaller, than, the, tenor, in, the, woodcut, above, middle, right, like, virdung, agricola, takes, it, for, granted, that, recorders, should, be, played, in, four, part, consorts, unlike, getutscht, which, provides, a, single, condensed, fingering, chart, agricola, provides, separate, slightly, differing, fingering, charts, for, each, instrument, leading, some, to, suppose, that, agricola, experimented, on, three, different, instruments, rather, than, copying, the, fingerings, from, one, size, to, the, other, two, agricola, adds, that, graces, mordanten, which, make, the, melody, subtil, must, be, learned, from, a, professional, pfeiffer, and, that, the, manner, of, ornamentation, coloratur, of, the, organist, is, best, of, all, a, substantial, 1545, revision, of, musica, instrumentalis, approvingly, mentions, the, use, of, vibrato, zitterndem, wind, for, woodwind, instruments, and, includes, an, account, of, articulation, recommending, the, syllables, de, for, semiminims, and, larger, di, ri, for, semiminims, and, smaller, and, the, articulation, tell, ell, ell, ell, el, le, which, he, calls, the, flutter, tongue, flitter, zunge, for, the, smallest, of, note, values, found, in, passagi, colorirn, the, next, treatise, comes, from, venice, silvestro, ganassi, dal, fontego, s, 1492, mid, 1500s, opera, intitulata, fontegara, 1535, which, is, the, first, work, to, focus, specifically, on, the, technique, of, playing, the, recorder, and, perhaps, the, only, historical, treatise, ever, published, that, approaches, a, description, of, a, professional, or, virtuoso, playing, technique, ganassi, was, a, musician, employed, by, the, doge, and, at, the, basilica, di, san, marco, at, the, time, of, the, work, s, publication, an, indication, of, his, high, level, of, accomplishment, and, later, wrote, two, works, on, the, playing, the, viol, and, the, violone, although, he, does, not, mention, being, employed, by, the, doge, after, fontegara, fontegara, can, be, broadly, divided, into, two, parts, the, first, concerns, the, technique, of, playing, the, recorder, the, second, demonstrated, divisions, regole, passagi, ornaments, some, of, great, complexity, which, the, player, may, use, to, ornament, a, melody, or, literally, divide, it, into, smaller, notes, in, all, aspects, ganassi, emphasises, the, importance, of, imitating, the, human, voice, declaring, that, the, aim, of, the, recorder, player, is, to, imitate, as, closely, as, possible, all, the, capabilities, of, the, human, voice, maintaining, that, the, recorder, is, indeed, able, to, do, this, for, ganassi, imitation, of, the, voice, has, three, aspects, a, certain, artistic, proficiency, which, seems, to, be, the, ability, to, perceive, the, nature, of, the, music, prontezza, dexterity, or, fluency, achieved, by, varying, the, pressure, of, the, breath, and, shading, the, tone, by, means, of, suitable, fingering, and, galanteria, elegance, or, grace, achieved, by, articulation, and, by, the, use, of, ornaments, the, simplest, ingredient, of, them, being, the, trill, which, varies, according, to, the, expression, ganassi, gives, fingering, tables, for, a, range, of, an, octave, and, a, seventh, the, standard, range, also, remarked, by, praetorius, then, tells, the, reader, that, he, has, discovered, through, long, experimentation, more, notes, not, known, to, other, players, due, to, their, lack, of, perseverance, extending, the, range, to, two, octaves, and, a, sixth, ganassi, gives, fingerings, for, three, recorders, with, different, makers, marks, and, advises, the, reader, to, experiment, with, different, fingerings, as, recorders, vary, in, their, bore, the, maker, s, mark, of, one, of, the, recorders, in, the, form, of, a, stylised, letter, a, has, been, associated, with, the, schnitzer, family, of, instrument, makers, in, germany, leading, hermann, moeck, to, suppose, that, ganassi, s, recorder, might, have, been, northern, european, in, origin, see, also, note, on, ganassi, recorders, ganassi, uses, three, basic, kinds, of, syllables, te, che, te, re, and, le, re, and, also, varies, the, vowel, used, with, the, syllable, suggesting, the, effect, of, mouth, shape, on, the, sound, of, the, recorder, he, gives, many, combinations, of, these, syllables, and, vowels, and, suggests, the, choice, of, the, syllables, according, to, their, smoothness, te, che, being, least, smooth, and, le, re, being, most, so, he, does, not, however, demonstrate, how, the, syllables, should, be, used, to, music, most, of, the, treatise, consists, of, tables, of, diminutions, of, intervals, small, melodies, and, cadences, categorised, by, their, meter, these, several, hundred, divisions, use, quintuplets, septuplets, note, values, from, whole, notes, to, 32nd, notes, in, modern, notation, and, demonstrate, immense, variety, and, complexity, the, frontispiece, to, fontegara, shows, three, recorder, players, play, together, with, two, singers, like, agricola, and, virdung, ganassi, takes, for, granted, that, recorders, should, be, played, in, groups, of, four, and, come, in, three, sizes, f, 3, c, 4, and, g, 4, he, makes, a, distinction, between, solo, playing, and, ensemble, playing, noting, that, what, he, has, said, is, for, solo, players, and, that, when, playing, with, others, it, is, most, important, to, match, them, unfortunately, ganassi, gives, only, a, few, ornamented, examples, with, little, context, for, their, use, nonetheless, ganassi, offers, a, tantalising, glimpse, at, a, highly, developed, professional, culture, and, technique, of, woodwind, playing, that, modern, players, can, scarcely, be, said, to, have, improved, upon, gerolamo, cardano, s, de, musica, was, written, around, 1546, but, not, published, until, 1663, when, it, was, published, along, with, other, works, by, cardan, who, was, an, eminent, philosopher, mathematician, and, physician, as, well, as, a, keen, amateur, recorder, player, who, learned, from, a, professional, teacher, leo, oglonus, as, a, child, in, milan, his, account, corroborates, that, of, ganassi, using, the, same, three, basic, syllables, and, emphasising, the, importance, of, breath, control, and, ornamentation, in, recorder, playing, but, also, documents, several, aspects, of, recorder, technique, otherwise, undocumented, until, the, twentieth, century, these, include, multiple, techniques, using, the, partial, closing, of, the, bell, to, produce, a, tone, or, semitone, below, the, tonic, and, to, change, semitones, into, dieses, half, semitones, which, he, says, can, also, be, produced, by, repercussively, bending, back, the, tongue, he, also, adds, that, the, position, of, the, tongue, either, extended, or, turned, up, towards, the, palate, can, be, used, to, improve, vary, and, color, notes, he, is, the, first, to, differentiate, between, the, amount, of, the, breath, full, shallow, or, moderate, and, the, force, relaxed, or, slow, intense, and, the, median, between, them, as, well, as, the, different, amount, of, air, required, for, each, instrument, and, describes, a, trill, or, vibrato, called, a, vox, tremula, in, which, a, tremulous, quality, in, the, breath, is, combined, with, a, trilling, of, the, fingers, to, vary, the, interval, from, anything, between, a, major, third, and, a, diesis, he, is, also, the, first, writer, to, mention, the, recorder, in, d, 5, discantus, which, he, leaves, unnamed, composer, and, singer, philibert, jambe, de, fer, c, 1515, c, 1566, was, the, only, french, author, of, the, sixteenth, century, to, write, about, the, recorder, in, his, epitome, musical, he, complains, of, the, french, name, for, the, instrument, fleutte, neuf, trouz, flute, with, nine, holes, as, in, practice, one, of, the, lowermost, holes, must, be, plugged, leaving, only, eight, open, holes, he, prefers, fleute, d, italien, or, the, italian, flauto, his, fingering, chart, is, notable, for, two, reasons, first, for, describing, fingerings, with, the, 15th, produced, as, a, variant, on, the, 14th, and, for, using, the, third, finger, of, the, lower, hand, as, a, buttress, finger, although, only, for, three, notes, in, the, lower, octave, see, also, renaissance, structure, aurelio, virgiliano, s, il, dolcimelo, c, 1600, presents, ricercars, intended, for, or, playable, on, the, recorder, a, description, of, other, musical, instruments, and, a, fingering, chart, for, a, recorder, in, g, 4, similar, to, jambe, de, fer, s, the, syntagma, musicum, 1614, 20, of, michael, praetorius, 1571, 1621, in, three, volumes, a, fourth, was, intended, but, never, finished, is, an, encyclopaedic, survey, of, music, and, musical, instruments, volume, ii, de, organographia, 1619, is, of, particular, interest, for, its, description, of, no, fewer, than, eight, sizes, of, recorder, klein, fl, tlein, or, exilent, in, g, 5, discant, in, c, 5, or, d, 5, alt, in, g, 4, tenor, in, c, 4, basset, in, f, 3, bass, in, b, 2, and, grossbass, in, f, 2, as, well, as, the, four, holed, gar, kleine, plockfl, tlein, praetorius, was, the, first, author, to, explain, that, recorders, can, confuse, the, ear, into, believing, that, they, sound, an, octave, lower, than, pitch, which, phenomenon, has, more, recently, been, explained, in, relation, to, the, recorder, s, lack, of, high, harmonics, he, also, shows, the, different, registers, of, consort, possible, 2, discant, alt, and, tenor, 4, alt, tenor, and, basset, and, 8, tenor, basset, and, bass, see, also, nomenclature, additionally, he, proposed, cutting, the, recorder, between, the, beak, and, the, first, finger, hole, to, allow, for, a, kind, of, tuning, slide, to, raise, or, lower, its, pitch, similar, to, the, baroque, practice, of, adjusting, a, recorder, s, pitch, by, pulling, out, the, top, joint, of, the, recorder, the, recorders, described, in, praetorius, are, of, the, stretched, hourglass, profile, see, above, far, right, he, gives, fingerings, like, those, of, ganassi, and, remarks, that, they, normally, have, a, range, of, an, octave, and, a, sixth, although, exceptional, players, could, extend, that, range, by, a, fourth, some, paintings, from, the, fourteenth, and, fifteenth, centuries, depict, musicians, playing, what, appear, to, be, two, end, blown, flutes, simultaneously, in, some, cases, the, two, flutes, are, evidently, disjoint, separate, flutes, of, similar, make, played, angled, away, from, each, other, one, pipe, in, each, hand, in, others, flutes, of, the, same, length, have, differing, hand, positions, in, a, final, case, the, pipes, are, parallel, in, contact, with, each, other, and, differ, in, length, while, the, iconographic, criteria, for, a, recorder, are, typically, a, clearly, recognisable, labium, and, a, double, handed, vertical, playing, technique, such, criteria, are, not, prescriptive, and, it, is, uncertain, whether, any, of, these, depictions, should, be, considered, a, single, instrument, or, constitute, a, kind, of, recorder, the, identification, of, the, instrument, depicted, is, further, complicated, by, the, symbolism, of, the, aulos, a, double, piped, instrument, associated, with, the, satyr, marsyas, of, greek, mythology, an, instrument, consisting, of, two, attached, parallel, end, blown, flutes, of, differing, length, dating, to, the, fifteenth, or, sixteenth, century, was, found, in, poor, condition, near, all, souls, college, in, oxford, the, instrument, has, four, holes, finger, holes, and, a, thumb, hole, for, each, hand, the, pipes, have, an, inverted, conical, choke, bore, see, renaissance, structure, bob, marvin, has, estimated, that, the, pipes, played, a, fifth, apart, at, approximately, c, 5, and, g, 5, the, instrument, is, sui, generis, although, the, instrument, s, pipes, have, thumb, holes, the, lack, of, organological, precedent, makes, classification, of, the, instrument, difficult, marvin, has, used, the, terms, double, recorder, and, the, categorisation, agnostic, flauto, doppio, double, flute, to, describe, the, oxford, instrument, marvin, has, designed, a, flauto, doppio, based, on, the, oxford, instrument, scaled, to, play, at, f, 4, and, c, 5, italian, recorder, maker, francesco, livirghi, has, designed, a, double, recorder, or, flauto, doppio, with, connected, angled, pipes, of, the, same, length, but, played, with, different, hand, positions, based, on, iconographic, sources, its, pipes, play, at, f, 4, and, b, 4, both, instruments, use, fingerings, of, the, makers, design, in, the, 1970s, when, recorder, makers, began, to, make, the, first, models, of, recorders, from, the, sixteenth, and, seventeenth, centuries, such, models, were, not, always, representative, of, the, playing, characteristics, of, the, original, instruments, especially, notable, is, fred, morgan, s, much, copied, ganassi, model, based, loosely, on, an, instrument, in, the, vienna, kunsthistorisches, museum, inventory, number, sam, 135, which, was, designed, to, use, the, fingerings, for, the, highest, notes, in, ganassi, s, tables, in, fontegara, as, morgan, knew, these, notes, were, not, in, standard, use, indeed, ganassi, uses, them, in, only, a, few, of, the, hundreds, of, diminutions, contained, in, fontegara, historically, such, recorders, did, not, exist, as, a, distinct, type, and, the, fingerings, given, by, ganassi, were, those, of, a, skilled, player, particularly, familiar, with, his, instruments, when, modern, music, is, written, for, ganassi, recorders, it, means, this, type, of, recorder, recorders, were, probably, first, used, to, play, vocal, music, later, adding, purely, instrumental, forms, such, as, dance, music, to, their, repertoire, much, of, the, vocal, music, of, the, fifteenth, sixteenth, and, seventeenth, centuries, can, be, played, on, recorder, consorts, and, as, illustrated, in, treatises, from, virdung, to, praetorius, the, choice, appropriate, instruments, and, transpositions, to, play, vocal, music, was, common, practice, in, the, renaissance, additionally, some, collections, such, as, those, of, pierre, attaingnant, and, anthony, holborne, indicate, that, their, instrumental, music, was, suitable, for, recorder, consorts, this, section, first, discusses, repertoire, marked, for, the, recorder, then, briefly, other, repertoire, played, on, recorder, in, 1505, giovanni, alvise, a, venetian, wind, player, offered, francesco, gonzaga,

bassano, family, from, venice, to, form, a, consort, expanded, to, six, members, in, 1550, forming, a, group, that, maintained, an, exceptional, focus, on, the, recorder, until, at, least, 1630, when, the, recorder, consort, was, combined, with, the, other, wind, groups, most, wind, bands, consisted, of, players, playing, sackbutts, shawms, and, other, loud, instruments, doubling, on, recorder, some, music, probably, intended, for, this, group, survives, including, dance, music, by, augustine, and, geronimo, bassano, from, the, third, quarter, of, the, sixteenth, century, and, the, more, elaborate, fantasias, of, jeronimo, bassano, c, 1580, four, in, five, parts, and, one, in, six, parts, additionally, the, fitzwilliam, wind, manuscript, gb, cfm, 734, contains, wordless, motets, madrigals, and, dance, pieces, including, some, by, the, bassano, family, probably, intended, for, a, recorder, consort, in, six, parts, the, english, members, of, the, bassano, family, having, originated, in, venice, were, also, probably, familiar, with, the, vocal, style, advanced, technique, and, complex, improvised, ornamentation, described, in, ganassi, s, fontegara, and, they, were, probably, among, the, recorder, players, whom, ganassi, reports, having, worked, and, studied, with, when, they, were, brought, to, england, they, were, regarded, as, some, of, the, best, wind, players, in, venice, while, most, of, the, music, attributed, to, the, consort, uses, only, a, range, of, a, thirteenth, it, is, possible, that, the, bassano, s, were, familiar, with, ganassi, s, extended, range, recorders, were, also, played, with, other, instruments, especially, in, england, where, it, was, called, a, mixed, consort, or, broken, consort, other, sixteenth, century, composers,

paintings, from, the, sixteenth, century, show, aristocracy, of, both, sexes, playing, the, recorder, however, many, gentlemen, found, it, unbecoming, to, play, because, it, uses, the, mouth, preferring, the, lute, and, later, the, viol, shakespeare, mentions, the, recorder, in, hamlet, written, at, the, turn, of, the, seventeenth, century, as, does, milton, in, paradise, lost, published, in, 1667, in, which, fallen, angels, in, hell, move, in, perfect, phalanx, to, the, dorian, mood, of, flutes, and, soft, recorders, several, changes, in, the, construction, of, recorders, took, place, in, the, seventeenth, century, resulting, in, the, type, of, instrument, generally, referred, to, as, baroque, recorders, as, opposed, to, the, earlier, renaissance, recorders, these, innovations, allowed, baroque, recorders, to, possess, a, tone, regarded, as, sweeter, than, that, of, the, earlier, instruments, at, the, expense, of, a, reduction, in, volume, particularly, in, the, lowest, notes, the, evolution, of, the, renaissance, recorder, into, the, baroque, instrument, is, generally, attributed, to, the, hotteterre, family, in, france, they, developed, the, ideas, of, a, more, tapered, bore, bringing, the, finger, holes, of, the, lowermost, hand, closer, together, allowing, greater, range, and, enabling, the, construction, of, instruments, in, several, jointed, sections, the, last, innovation, allowed, more, accurate, shaping, of, each, section, and, also, offered, the, player, minor, tuning, adjustments, by, slightly, pulling, out, one, of, the, sections, to, lengthen, the, instrument, the, french, innovations, were, taken, to, london, by, pierre, bressan, a, set, of, whose, instruments, survive, in, the, grosvenor, museum, chester, as, do, other, examples, in, various, american, european, and, japanese, museums, and, private, collections, bressan, s, contemporary, thomas, stanesby, was, born, in, derbyshire, but, became, an, instrument, maker, in, london, he, and, his, son, thomas, stanesby, junior, were, the, other, important, british, based, recorder, makers, of, the, early, eighteenth, century, in, continental, europe, the, denner, family, of, nuremberg, were, the, most, celebrated, makers, of, this, period, the, baroque, recorder, produces, a, most, brilliant, and, projecting, sound, in, the, second, octave, which, is, more, facile, and, extended, than, that, of, earlier, recorders, while, the, lowest, notes, in, its, range, are, relatively, weak, composers, such, as, bach, telemann, and, vivaldi, exploit, this, property, in, their, concertos, for, the, instrument, measured, from, its, lowest, to, its, highest, playable, note, the, baroque, alto, recorder, has, a, range, of, at, most, two, octaves, and, a, fifth, with, many, instruments, having, a, smaller, range, even, the, most, developed, instruments, of, the, period, however, cannot, produce, the, augmented, tonic, third, and, fourth, of, the, third, octave, notably, georg, philipp, telemann, s, concerto, twv, 51, f1, makes, use, some, of, these, notes, in, the, third, octave, posing, significant, technical, challenges, to, the, player, perhaps, requiring, the, covering, of, the, bell, or, other, unusual, techniques, during, the, baroque, period, the, recorder, was, traditionally, associated, with, pastoral, scenes, miraculous, events, funerals, marriages, and, amorous, scenes, images, of, recorders, can, be, found, in, literature, and, artwork, associated, with, all, of, these, purcell, j, s, bach, telemann, and, vivaldi, used, the, recorder, to, suggest, shepherds, and, imitate, birds, in, their, music, although, the, recorder, achieved, a, greater, level, of, standardisation, in, the, baroque, than, in, previous, periods, indeed, it, is, the, first, period, in, which, there, was, a, standard, size, of, recorder, ambiguous, nomenclature, and, uncertain, organological, evidence, have, led, to, controversy, regarding, which, instruments, should, be, used, in, some, flute, parts, from, the, period, the, concertino, group, of, bach, s, fourth, brandenburg, concerto, in, g, major, bwv, 1049, consists, of, a, violono, principale, and, due, fiauti, d, echo, with, ripieno, strings, his, later, harpsichord, transcription, of, this, concerto, bwv, 1057, lowers, the, key, by, a, tone, as, in, all, of, bach, s, harpsichord, transcriptions, and, is, scored, for, solo, harpsichord, two, fiauti, bec, and, ripieno, strings, the, desired, instrument, for, the, fiauti, d, echo, parts, in, bwv, 1049, has, been, a, matter, of, perennial, musicological, and, organological, debate, for, two, primary, reasons, first, the, term, fiauto, d, echo, is, not, mentioned, in, dictionaries, or, tutors, of, the, period, and, second, the, first, fiauto, part, uses, f, 6, a, note, which, is, difficult, to, produce, on, a, baroque, alto, recorder, in, f4, the, instrumentation, of, bwv, 1057, is, uncontroversial, fiauti, bec, unambiguously, specifies, recorders, and, both, parts, have, been, modified, to, fit, comfortably, on, altos, in, f4, avoiding, for, example, an, unplayable, eb4, in, the, second, fiauto, that, would, have, resulted, from, a, simple, transposition, of, a, tone, for, the, first, and, last, movements, of, the, concerto, two, opinions, predominate, first, that, both, recorder, parts, should, be, played, on, alto, recorders, in, f4, and, second, that, the, first, part, should, be, played, on, an, alto, recorder, in, g, and, the, second, part, on, an, alto, in, f, tushaar, power, has, argued, for, the, alto, in, g4, on, the, basis, that, bach, uses, the, high, f, 6, which, can, be, easily, played, on, an, alto, in, g4, but, not, the, low, f4, a, note, not, playable, on, the, alto, in, g4, he, corroborates, this, with, other, alto, recorder, parts, in, bach, s, cantatas, michael, marissen, reads, the, repertoire, differently, demonstrating, that, in, other, recorder, parts, bach, used, both, the, low, f4, and, f, 6, as, well, as, higher, notes, marissen, argues, that, bach, was, not, as, consistent, as, power, asserts, and, that, bach, would, have, almost, certainly, had, access, to, only, altos, in, f, he, corroborates, this, with, examinations, of, pitch, standards, and, notation, in, bach, s, cantatas, in, which, the, recorder, parts, are, sometimes, written, as, transposing, instruments, to, play, with, organs, that, sounded, as, much, as, a, minor, third, above, written, pitch, marissen, also, reads, bach, s, revisions, to, the, recorder, parts, in, bwv, 1057, as, indicative, of, his, avoidance, of, f, 6, in, bwv, 1049, a, sign, that, he, only, used, the, difficult, note, when, necessary, in, designing, the, part, for, an, alto, recorder, in, f4, he, posits, that, bach, avoided, f, 6, in, bwv, 1049, at, the, cost, of, inferior, counterpoint, reinstating, them, as, e6, in, bwv, 1057, in, the, second, movement, breaking, of, beaming, in, the, fiauto, parts, markings, of, f, and, p, the, fermata, over, the, final, double, bar, of, the, first, movement, and, the, 21, bars, of, rest, at, the, beginning, of, the, third, have, led, some, musicologists, to, argue, that, bach, intended, the, use, of, echo, flutes, distinct, from, normal, recorders, in, the, second, movement, in, particular, the, breaking, of, beaming, could, be, an, indication, of, changes, in, register, or, tonal, quality, the, rests, introduced, to, allow, the, players, time, to, change, instruments, and, the, markings, of, f, and, p, further, indicative, of, register, or, sound, changes, marissen, has, demonstrated, that, the, f, and, p, markings, probably, indicated, tutti, and, solo, sections, rather, than, loud, and, soft, ones, a, number, of, instruments, other, than, normal, recorders, have, been, suggested, for, the, fiauto, d, echo, one, of, the, earliest, proposed, alternatives, by, thurston, dart, was, the, use, of, double, flageolets, a, suggestion, since, revealed, to, be, founded, on, unsteady, musicological, grounds, dart, did, however, bring, to, light, numerous, newspaper, references, to, paisible, s, performance, on, an, echo, flute, between, 1713, and, 1718, another, contemporary, reference, to, the, echo, flute, is, in, etienne, louli, s, elements, ou, principes, de, musique, amsterdam, 1696, les, sons, de, deux, flutes, d, echo, sont, differents, parce, que, l, un, est, fort, que, l, autre, est, foible, the, sounds, of, two, echo, flutes, are, different, because, one, is, strong, and, the, other, is, weak, louli, is, unclear, on, why, one, would, need, two, echo, flutes, to, play, strongly, and, weakly, and, on, why, it, is, that, echo, flutes, differ, perhaps, the, echo, flute, was, composed, in, two, halves, one, which, plays, strongly, the, other, weakly, on, this, we, can, only, speculate, surviving, instruments, which, are, candidates, for, echo, flutes, include, an, instrument, in, leipzig, which, consists, of, two, recorders, of, different, tonal, characteristics, joined, at, the, head, and, footjoints, by, brass, flanges, there, is, also, evidence, of, double, recorders, tuned, in, thirds, but, these, are, not, candidates, for, the, fiauto, parts, in, bwv, 1049, vivaldi, wrote, three, concertos, for, the, flautino, possibly, for, performance, by, students, at, the, ospedale, della, piet, in, venice, where, he, taught, and, composed, in, the, early, eighteenth, century, they, feature, virtuosic, solo, writing, and, along, with, his, concerto, rv, 441, and, trio, sonata, rv, 86, are, his, most, virtuosic, recorder, works, they, each, survive, a, single, hastily, written, manuscript, copy, each, titled, con, to, per, flautino, concerto, for, little, flute, with, the, additional, note, gl, istrom, ti, trasportati, alla, 4a, the, instruments, transpose, by, a, fourth, in, rv, 443, and, gl, istrom, ti, alla, 4ta, bassa, the, instruments, lower, by, a, fourth, in, rv, 445, the, three, concertos, rv, 443, 444, and, 445, are, notated, in, c, major, c, major, and, a, minor, respectively, also, of, note, is, the, occasional, use, of, notes, outside, the, normal, two, octave, compass, of, the, recorder, the, range, of, the, solo, sections, is, two, octaves, from, notated, f4, to, notated, f6, however, there, is, a, single, notated, c4, in, the, first, movement, of, rv, 444, a, notated, e4, in, a, tutti, section, in, the, first, movement, of, rv, 443, and, low, e4, in, multiple, tutti, sections, of, rv, 445, a, number, of, possible, flautini, have, been, proposed, as, the, instrument, intended, for, the, performance, of, these, concertos, the, first, suggestion, was, the, use, of, the, one, keyed, piccolo, or, another, small, transverse, flute, however, such, instruments, had, fallen, out, of, use, in, venice, by, the, generally, accepted, time, of, composition, of, these, concertos, in, the, 1720s, and, this, opinion, is, no, longer, considered, well, supported, another, suggestion, first, proposed, by, peter, thalheimer, is, the, french, flageolet, see, flageolets, below, in, g5, which, was, notated, in, d4, appearing, a, fourth, lower, possibly, explaining, the, note, in, the, margins, of, rv, 443, and, rv, 445, gl, istromti, transportati, alla, 4a, and, supported, by, bismantova, 1677, rev, 1694, and, bonanni, 1722, which, equate, flautino, to, the, flageolet, however, this, suggestion, has, been, opposed, by, the, presence, of, notated, f, 4, and, f, 4, which, are, not, within, the, typical, compass, of, the, flageolet, although, they, may, be, produced, through, the, covering, of, the, bell, sometimes, combined, with, underblowing, as, attested, by, theorists, as, early, as, cardano, c, 1546, and, as, late, as, bellay, c, 1800, two, instruments, are, conventionally, accepted, today, for, the, performance, of, these, concertos, the, sopranino, recorder, notated, like, an, alto, but, sounding, an, octave, higher, and, the, soprano, recorder, following, the, instruction, to, transpose, the, parts, down, by, a, fourth, winfried, michel, was, first, to, argue, in, favour, of, the, soprano, recorder, in, 1983, when, he, proposed, to, take, vivaldi, at, his, word, and, transpose, the, string, parts, down, a, fourth, and, play, the, flautino, part, on, a, soprano, recorder, in, c5, also, fifth, flute, using, the, english, practice, of, notating, such, flutes, as, transposing, instruments, using, the, fingerings, of, an, alto, recorder, michel, notes, that, this, transposition, allows, for, the, use, of, the, violins, and, viola, s, lowest, strings, in, sections, where, they, provide, the, accompaniment, without, bass, and, the, lowest, two, notes, of, the, cello, he, attributes, the, presence, of, notes, not, in, the, recorder, s, normal, compass, to, vivaldi, s, haste, noting, that, these, notes, do, not, appear, in, the, solo, sections, he, has, edited, editions, of, rv, 443, and, rv, 445, for, soprano, recorder, in, g, major, and, e, minor, respectively, federico, maria, sardelli, concurs, with, michel, in, supposing, that, the, margin, note, was, intended, to, allow, the, performance, of, the, concertos, on, the, soprano, recorder, on, a, specific, occasion, however, concludes, that, they, were, probably, written, for, the, sopranino, recorder, in, f5, noting, that, small, transverse, flutes, had, fallen, out, of, use, in, italy, by, vivaldi, s, time, the, paucity, of, flageolets, in, italy, the, range, of, the, parts, and, uses, of, the, flautino, in, vocal, arias, the, recorder, was, little, used, in, art, music, of, the, classical, and, romantic, periods, researchers, have, long, debated, why, this, change, occurred, and, to, what, extent, the, recorder, remained, use, in, the, late, eighteenth, century, and, later, the, nineteenth, century, a, significant, question, in, this, debate, is, which, if, any, duct, flutes, of, this, period, are, recorders, or, successors, to, recorders, the, recorder, work, of, the, latter, half, of, the, eighteenth, century, most, known, today, is, probably, a, trio, sonata, by, c, p, e, bach, wq, 163, composed, in, 1755, an, arrangement, of, a, trio, sonata, for, two, violins, and, continuo, scored, for, the, unusual, ensemble, of, viola, bass, recorder, and, continuo, this, work, is, also, notable, for, being, perhaps, the, only, significant, surviving, historical, solo, work, for, bass, recorder, also, of, note, are, the, works, of, johann, christoph, schultze, c, 1733, 1813, who, wrote, two, concertos, for, the, instrument, one, in, g, major, and, another, in, b, major, written, around, 1740, the, last, occurrences, of, the, recorder, in, art, music, are, apparently, by, carl, maria, von, weber, in, peter, schmoll, und, seine, nachbarn, 1801, and, kleiner, tusch, 1806, hector, berlioz, may, have, intended, la, fuite, en, egypte, from, l, enfance, du, christ, 1853, for, the, instrument, donizetti, owned, three, recorders, many, reasons, supporting, the, conventional, view, that, the, recorder, declined, have, been, proposed, the, first, significant, explanation, for, the, recorder, s, decline, was, proposed, by, waitzman, 1967, who, proposed, six, reasons, in, the, baroque, the, majority, of, professional, recorder, players, were, primarily, oboists, or, string, players, for, this, reason, the, number, of, professional, exponents, of, the, recorder, was, smaller, than, that, of, other, woodwinds, others, attribute, the, decline, of, the, recorder, in, part, to, the, flute, innovators, of, the, time, such, as, grenser, and, tromlitz, who, extended, the, transverse, flute, s, range, and, evened, out, its, tonal, consistency, through, the, addition, of, keys, or, to, the, supposedly, greater, dynamic, range, and, volume, of, the, flute, similar, developments, occurring, in, many, other, orchestral, instruments, to, make, them, louder, increase, their, range, and, increase, their, tonal, consistency, did, not, simultaneously, occur, in, the, case, of, the, recorder, a, complementary, view, recently, advanced, by, nikolaj, tarasov, is, that, the, recorder, rather, than, totally, disappearing, evolved, in, similar, ways, to, other, wind, instruments, through, the, addition, of, keys, and, other, devices, and, remained, in, use, throughout, the, nineteenth, century, with, its, direct, descendant, s, popularity, overlapping, with, the, late, nineteenth, and, early, twentieth, century, recorder, revival, support, for, this, view, rests, on, the, organological, classification, of, some, nineteenth, century, duct, flutes, as, recorders, for, more, on, this, question, see, other, duct, flutes, duct, flutes, remained, popular, even, as, the, recorder, waned, in, the, eighteenth, century, as, in, the, instrument, s, earliest, history, questions, of, the, instrument, s, quiddity, are, at, the, forefront, of, modern, debate, the, modification, and, renaming, of, recorders, in, the, eighteenth, century, in, order, to, prolong, their, use, and, the, uncertainty, of, the, extent, of, the, recorder, s, use, the, late, eighteenth, and, early, nineteenth, centuries, have, fuelled, these, debates, some, recent, researchers, contend, that, some, nineteenth, century, duct, flutes, are, actually, recorders, this, article, briefly, discusses, the, duct, flutes, presented, as, successors, to, the, recorder, the, english, flageolet, and, the, csakan, which, were, popular, among, amateurs, in, the, second, half, of, the, eighteenth, century, and, the, whole, of, the, nineteenth, the, word, flageolet, has, been, used, since, the, sixteenth, century, to, refer, to, small, duct, flutes, and, the, instrument, is, sometimes, designated, using, general, terms, such, as, flautino, and, flauto, piccolo, complicating, identification, of, its, earliest, form, it, was, first, described, by, mersenne, in, harmonie, universelle, 1636, as, having, four, fingers, holes, on, the, front, and, two, thumb, holes, on, the, back, with, a, lowest, note, c6, and, a, compass, of, two, octaves, like, the, recorder, the, upper, thumb, hole, is, used, as, an, octaving, vent, flageolets, were, generally, small, flutes, however, their, lowest, note, varies, they, were, initially, popular, in, france, and, it, is, from, there, that, the, flageolet, first, arrived, in, england, in, the, seventeenth, century, becoming, a, popular, amateur, instrument, as, the, recorder, later, did, indeed, when, the, recorder, was, introduced, to, england, it, was, presented, as, an, easy, instrument, for, those, who, already, played, the, flageolet, and, the, earliest, english, recorder, tutors, are, notated, in, the, flageolet, tablature, of, the, time, called, dot, way, notably, the, diarist, and, naval, administrator, samuel, pepys, 1633, 1703, and, his, wife, were, both, amateur, players, of, the, flageolet, and, pepys, was, later, an, amateur, recorder, player, starting, in, the, early, 1800s, a, number, of, innovations, were, introduced, to, the, flageolet, including, the, addition, of, keys, to, extend, its, range, and, allow, it, to, more, easily, play, accidentals, they, also, included, solutions, to, the, problem, of, condensation, most, commonly, a, sea, sponge, was, placed, inside, the, wind, chamber, the, conical, chamber, above, the, windway, to, soak, up, moisture, more, novel, solutions, such, as, the, insertion, of, a, thin, wooden, wedge, into, the, windway, the, drilling, of, little, holes, in, the, side, of, the, block, to, drain, condensation, and, a, complex, system, for, draining, condensation, through, a, hollowed, out, block, were, also, developed, around, 1800, in, england, the, recorder, english, flute, see, name, came, to, be, called, an, english, flageolet, appropriating, the, name, of, the, more, fashionable, instrument, from, at, least, this, time, to, the, present, the, flageolet, in, its, first, form, has, been, called, the, french, flageolet, to, differentiate, it, from, the, so, called, english, flageolet, from, around, 1803, when, the, london, instrument, maker, william, bainbridge, obtained, a, number, of, patents, for, improvements, to, the, english, flageolet, instruments, were, often, referred, as, improved, or, patent, flageolets, with, little, reference, to, how, they, actually, differed, from, their, predecessors, in, this, period, the, instrument, had, six, finger, holes, and, single, thumb, hole, and, had, as, many, as, six, keys, tarasov, reports, that, the, english, flageolets, of, the, late, eighteenth, century, had, six, finger, holes, and, no, thumb, hole, and, later, regained, the, thumb, hole, and, seventh, finger, hole, see, above, right, the, english, flageolet, never, reached, the, level, of, popularity, that, the, french, flageolet, enjoyed, in, the, nineteenth, century, possibly, because, the, latter, instrument, was, louder, both, remained, popular, until, the, beginning, of, the, twentieth, century, a, significant, amount, of, music, was, written, for, the, flageolet, in, the, nineteenth, century, such, as, the, etudes, of, narcisse, bousquet, although, much, of, it, was, directed, at, amateurs, english, flageolets, that, may, qualify, as, recorders, are, of, two, types, those, early, instruments, called, english, flageolets, which, were, actually, recorders, and, nineteenth, century, instruments, with, seven, finger, holes, and, a, thumb, hole, these, instruments, are, not, typically, regarded, as, recorders, however, tarasov, has, argued, for, their, inclusion, in, the, family, the, csakan, from, hung, cs, k, ny, pickaxe, also, known, by, the, recorder, s, old, french, name, flute, douce, was, a, duct, flute, in, the, shape, of, a, walking, stick, or, oboe, popular, in, vienna, from, about, 1800, to, the, 1840s, the, csakan, was, played, using, the, fingerings, of, a, recorder, in, c, and, was, typically, pitched, in, a, or, g, and, played, as, a, transposing, instrument, the, first, documented, appearance, of, the, csakan, was, at, a, concert, in, budapest, on, 18, february, 1807, in, a, performance, by, its, billed, inventor, anton, heberle, fl, 1806, 16, tarasov, has, contested, heberle, s, status, as, the, inventor, of, the, instrument, and, has, argued, that, the, csakan, grew, out, of, a, hungarian, war, hammer, of, the, same, name, which, was, converted, into, a, recorder, perhaps, for, playing, military, music, around, 1800, it, was, highly, fashionable, for, make, walking, sticks, with, additional, functions, e, g, umbrellas, swords, flutes, oboes, clarinets, horns, although, the, csakan, was, the, most, popular, of, these, and, the, only, one, that, became, a, musical, instrument, in, its, own, right, the, earliest, instruments, were, shaped, like, a, walking, stick, with, a, mouthpiece, in, the, handle, and, had, no, keys, although, they, could, eventually, have, up, to, thirteen, keys, along, with, a, tuning, slide, and, a, device, for, narrowing, the, thumb, hole, in, the, 1820s, a, csakan, in, the, pleasing, shape, of, an, oboe, was, introduced, in, a, simple, form, with, a, single, key, and, a, complex, form, with, up, to, twelve, keys, like, those, found, on, contemporaneous, flutes, well, known, makers, of, the, csakan, included, johann, ziegler, and, stephan, koch, in, vienna, and, franz, sch, llnast, in, pressburg, according, to, accounts, left, by, sch, llnast, the, csakan, was, primarily, an, amateur, instrument, purchased, by, those, who, wanted, something, simple, and, inexpensive, however, there, were, also, accomplished, professionals, such, as, viennese, court, oboist, ernst, kr, hmer, 1795, 1837, who, toured, as, far, afield, as, russia, playing, the, csakan, with, acclaimed, virtuosity, around, 400, works, for, the, csakan, were, published, in, the, first, half, of, the, nineteenth, century, mainly, for, csakan, solo, csakan, duet, or, csakan, with, guitar, or, piano, the, csakan, s, repertoire, has, not, yet, been, fully, explored, notable, composers, for, the, instrument, include, heberle, and, kr, hmer, and, tarasov, notes, that, piano, works, by, beethoven, were, arranged, for, csakan, and, guitar, beethoven, is, reported, to, have, owned, a, walking, stick, csakan, modern, recorder, makers, such, as, bernhard, mollenhauer, and, martin, wenner, have, made, csakan, copies, similarities, in, fingering, and, design, make, the, csakan, at, least, a, close, relative, of, the, recorder, accounts, of, kr, hmer, s, playing, which, report, his, diminishing, and, swelling, the, notes, up, to, an, almost, unbelievable, loudness, imply, a, developed, technique, using, shading, and, alternate, fingerings, far, beyond, a, purely, amateur, culture, of, house, music, additionally, tarasov, reports, that, some, recorders, by, baroque, makers, were, modified, around, 1800, through, the, addition, of, keys, including, a, j, c, denner, 1655, 1707, basset, recorder, in, budapest, and, an, alto, by, nikolaus, staub, 1664, 1734, with, added, g, keys, like, the, d, key, on, a, baroque, two, key, flute, another, modification, is, the, narrowing, of, the, thumb, hole, by, way, of, an, ivory, plug, on, the, j, c, denner, basset, and, an, alto, by, benedikt, gahn, 1674, 1711, to, allow, it, to, serve, purely, as, an, octaving, vent, as, found, on, many, flageolets, and, csakans, these, changes, may, be, archetypal, to, those, found, on, csakans, and, flageolets, and, constitute, an, inchoate, justification, for, the, continuous, development, of, the, baroque, recorder, into, its, nineteenth, century, relatives, the, concept, of, a, recorder, revival, must, be, considered, in, the, context, of, the, decline, of, the, recorder, in, the, eighteenth, and, nineteenth, centuries, the, craft, of, recorder, making, was, continued, in, some, form, by, a, number, of, families, such, as, the, berchtesgaden, fleitl, produced, by, the, oeggle, family, which, traces, its, lineage, to, the, walch, family, of, recorder, makers, the, careers, of, the, schlosser, family, of, zwota, heinrich, oskar, schlosser, 1875, 1947, made, instruments, sold, by, the, firm, of, moeck, in, celle, and, helped, to, design, their, tuju, series, of, recorders, the, firm, mollenhauer, currently, headed, by, bernhard, mollenhauer, can, trace, its, origins, to, historical, instrument, makers, the, recorder, if, it, did, persist, through, the, nineteenth, century, did, so, in, a, manner, quite, unlike, the, success, it, enjoyed, in, previous, centuries, or, that, it, would, enjoy, in, the, century, to, come, in, among, the, earliest, ensembles, to, begin, use, of, recorders, in, the, twentieth, century, was, the, bogenhauser, k, nstlerkapelle, bogenhausen, artists, band, which, from, 1890, to, 1939, used, antique, recorders, and, other, instruments, to, play, music, of, all, ages, including, arrangements, of, classical, and, romantic, music, nonetheless, the, recorder, was, considered, primarily, an, instrument, of, historical, interest, the, eventual, success, of, the, recorder, in, the, modern, era, is, often, attributed, to, arnold, dolmetsch, while, he, was, responsible, for, broadening, interest, in, the, united, kingdom, beyond, the, small, group, of, early, music, specialists, dolmetsch, was, not, solely, responsible, for, the, recorder, s, broader, revival, on, the, continent, his, efforts, were, preceded, by, those, of, musicians, at, the, brussels, conservatoire, where, dolmetsch, received, his, training, and, by, the, german, bogenhauser, k, nstlerkapelle, also, in, germany, the, work, of, willibald, gurlitt, werner, danckerts, and, gustav, scheck, proceeded, quite, independently, of, the, dolmetsches, carl, dolmetsch, the, son, of, arnold, dolmetsch, became, one, of, the, first, virtuoso, recorder, players, in, the, 1920s, but, more, importantly, he, began, to, commission, recorder, works, from, leading, composers, of, his, day, especially, for, performance, at, the, haslemere, festival, which, his, father, ran, initially, as, a, result, of, this, and, later, as, a, result, of, the, development, of, a, dutch, school, of, recorder, playing, led, by, kees, otten, the, recorder, was, introduced, to, serious, musicians, as, a, virtuoso, solo, instrument, both, in, britain, and, in, northern, europe, among, the, influential, virtuosos, who, figure, in, the, revival, of, the, recorder, as, a, serious, concert, instrument, in, the, latter, part, of, the, twentieth, century, are, ferdinand, conrad, kees, otten, frans, br, ggen, roger, cotte, hans, martin, linde, bernard, krainis, and, david, munrow, br, ggen, recorded, most, of, the, landmarks, of, the, historical, repertoire, and, commissioned, a, substantial, number, of, new, works, for, the, recorder, munrow, s,

remarkable, mixtures, of, historical, and, contemporary, repertoire, soloists, such, as, piers, adams, dan, laurin, and, dorothee, oberlinger, michala, petri, maurice, steger, in, the, 2012, charlotte, barbour, condini, became, the, first, recorder, player, to, reach, the, final, of, the, biennial, bbc, young, musician, of, the, year, competition, recorder, player, sophie, westbrooke, was, a, finalist, in, the, 2014, competition, the, first, recorders, to, be, played, in, the, modern, period, were, antique, instruments, from, previous, periods, anecdotally, arnold, dolmetsch, was, motivated, to, make, his, own, recorders, after, losing, a, bag, containing, his, antique, instruments, recorders, made, in, the, early, twentieth, century, were, imitative, of, baroque, models, in, their, exterior, form, but, differed, significantly, in, their, structure, dolmetsch, introduced, english, fingering, the, now, standard, fingering, for, baroque, model, instruments, and, standardised, the, doubled, 6th, and, 7th, holes, found, on, a, handful, of, antique, instruments, by, the, english, makers, stanesby, and, bressan, dolmetsch, instruments, generally, had, a, large, rectangular, windway, unlike, the, curved, windways, of, all, historical, instruments, and, played, at, modern, pitch, nearly, twice, as, many, pieces, have, been, written, for, the, recorder, since, its, modern, revival, as, were, written, in, all, previous, epochs, many, of, these, were, composed, by, avant, garde, composers, of, the, latter, half, of, the, twentieth, century, who, used, the, recorder, for, the, variety, of, extended, techniques, which, are, possible, using, its, open, holes, and, its, sensitivity, to, articulation, modern, composers, of, great, stature, have, written, for, the, recorder, including, paul, hindemith, luciano, berio, j, rg, baur, markus, zahnhausen, josef, tal, john, tavener, michael, tippett, benjamin, britten, leonard, bernstein, gordon, jacob, malcolm, arnold, steven, stucky, sean, hickey, and, edmund, rubbra, owing, to, its, ubiquity, as, a, teaching, instrument, and, the, relative, ease, of, sound, production, the, recorder, has, occasionally, been, used, in, popular, music, by, groups, such, as, the, beatles, the, rolling, stones, see, for, example, ruby, tuesday, yes, for, example, in, the, song, i, ve, seen, all, good,

duct, flutes, manufactured, in, the, nineteenth, and, late, eighteenth, centuries, were, intended, for, amateur, or, educational, use, and, were, not, constructed, to, the, high, standard, of, earlier, epochs, arnold, dolmetsch, the, first, to, achieve, commercial, production, in, the, twentieth, century, began, to, build, recorders, in, 1919, while, these, early, recorders, played, at, a, low, pitch, like, that, of, the, available, originals, he, did, not, strive, for, exactitude, in, reproduction, and, by, the, 1930s, the, dolmetsch, family, firm, then, under, the, direction, of, arnold, s, son, carl, dolmetsch, was, mass, producing, recorders, at, modern, pitch, with, wide, straight, windways, and, began, to, produce, bakelite, recorders, shortly, after, the, second, world, war, nonetheless, the, dolmetsch, models, were, innovative, for, their, time, and, proved, influential, particularly, in, standardising, the, english, fingering, system, now, standard, for, modern, baroque, style, instruments, and, doubled, 6th, and, 7th, holes, which, are, rare, on, antique, instruments, in, germany, peter, harlan, began, to, manufacture, recorders, in, the, 1920s, primarily, for, educational, use, in, the, youth, movement, following, harlan, s, success, numerous, makers, such, as, adler, and, mollenhauer, began, commercial, production, of, recorders, fuelling, an, explosion, in, the, instrument, s, popularity, in, germany, these, recorders, shared, little, in, common, with, antiques, with, large, straight, windways, anachronistically, pitched, consorts, modified, fingering, systems, and, other, innovations, in, the, latter, half, of, the, twentieth, century, historically, informed, performance, practice, was, on, the, rise, and, recorder, makers, increasingly, sought, to, imitate, the, sound, and, character, of, antiques, the, german, american, maker, friedrich, von, huene, was, among, the, first, to, research, recorders, held, in, european, collections, and, produce, instruments, intended, to, reproduce, the, qualities, of, the, antiques, von, huene, and, his, australian, colleague, frederick, morgan, sought, to, connect, the, tradition, of, the, historical, wind, makers, to, the, modern, day, with, the, understanding, that, doing, so, creates, the, best, instruments, and, those, most, suited, to, ancient, music, virtually, all, recorders, manufactured, today, claim, ascendancy, to, an, antique, model, and, most, makers, active, today, can, trace, their, trade, directly, to, one, of, these, pioneering, makers, today, makers, maintaining, individual, workshops, include, ammann, blezinger, bolton, boudreau, breukink, brown, coomber, cranmore, de, paolis, ehlert, holmblat, meyer, musch, netsch, prescott, rohmer, takeyama, von, huene, and, wenner, french, maker, philippe, bolton, created, an, electroacoustic, recorder, and, is, among, the, last, to, offer, mounted, bell, keys, and, double, bell, keys, for, both, tenor, and, alto, recorders, those, bell, keys, extend, easily, the, range, of, the, instrument, to, more, than, three, octaves, invented, by, carl, dolmetsch, in, 1957, he, first, used, the, bell, key, system, publicly, in, 1958, in, the, twentieth, century, carl, orff, used, the, recorder, as, part, of, his, orff, schulwerk, didactic, approach, his, five, volume, musik, f, r, kinder, published, between, 1950, and, 1954, contains, pieces, for, recorders, often, in, combination, with, other, instruments, manufacturers, have, made, recorders, out, of, bakelite, and, other, more, modern, plastics, they, are, thus, easy, to, produce, hence, inexpensive, because, of, this, recorders, are, popular, in, schools, as, they, are, one, of, the, cheapest, instruments, to, buy, in, bulk, they, are, also, relatively, easy, to, play, at, a, basic, level, because, sound, production, needs, only, breath, and, pitch, is, primarily, determined, by, fingering, though, excessive, breath, pressure, will, tend, to, drive, the, pitch, sharp, most, japanese, students, are, taught, to, play, the, recorder, the, recorder, is, a, very, social, instrument, many, recorder, players, participate, in, large, groups, or, in, one, to, a, part, chamber, groups, and, there, is, a, wide, variety, of, music, for, such, groupings, including, many, modern, works, groups, of, different, sized, instruments, help, to, compensate, for, the, limited, note, range, of, the, individual, instruments, four, part, arrangements, with, a, soprano, alto, tenor, and, bass, part, played, on, the, corresponding, recorders, are, common, although, more, complex, arrangements, with, multiple, parts, for, each, instrument, and, parts, for, lower, and, higher, instruments, may, also, be, regularly, encountered
