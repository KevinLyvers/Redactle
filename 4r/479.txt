dutch, golden, age, painting, is, the, painting, of, the, dutch, golden, age, a, period, in, dutch, history, roughly, spanning, the, 17th, century, during, and, after, the, later, part, of, the, eighty, years, war, 1568, 1648, for, dutch, independence, the, new, dutch, republic, was, the, most, prosperous, nation, in, europe, and, led, european, trade, science, and, art, the, northern, netherlandish, provinces, that, made, up, the, new, state, had, traditionally, been, less, important, artistic, centres, than, cities, in, flanders, in, the, south, the, upheavals, and, large, scale, transfers, of, population, of, the, war, and, the, sharp, break, with, the, old, monarchist, and, catholic, cultural, traditions, meant, that, dutch, art, had, to, reinvent, itself, almost, entirely, a, task, in, which, it, was, very, largely, successful, the, painting, of, religious, subjects, declined, very, sharply, but, a, large, new, market, for, all, kinds, of, secular, subjects, grew, up, although, dutch, painting, of, the, golden, age, is, included, in, the, general, european, period, of, baroque, painting, and, often, shows, many, of, its, characteristics, most, lacks, the, idealization, and, love, of, splendour, typical, of, much, baroque, work, including, that, of, neighbouring, flanders, most, work, including, that, for, which, the, period, is, best, known, reflects, the, traditions, of, detailed, realism, inherited, from, early, netherlandish, painting, a, distinctive, feature, of, the, period, is, the, proliferation, of, distinct, genres, of, paintings, with, the, majority, of, artists, producing, the, bulk, of, their, work, within, one, of, these, the, full, development, of, this, specialization, is, seen, from, the, late, 1620s, and, the, period, from, then, until, the, french, invasion, of, 1672, is, the, core, of, golden, age, painting, artists, would, spend, most, of, their, careers, painting, only, portraits, genre, scenes, landscapes, seascapes, and, ships, or, still, lifes, and, often, a, particular, sub, type, within, these, categories, many, of, these, types, of, subjects, were, new, in, western, painting, and, the, way, the, dutch, painted, them, in, this, period, was, decisive, for, their, future, development, a, distinctive, feature, of, the, period, compared, to, earlier, european, painting, was, the, small, amount, of, religious, painting, dutch, calvinism, forbade, religious, painting, in, churches, and, though, biblical, subjects, were, acceptable, in, private, homes, relatively, few, were, produced, the, other, traditional, classes, of, history, and, portrait, painting, were, present, but, the, period, is, more, notable, for, a, huge, variety, of, other, genres, sub, divided, into, numerous, specialized, categories, such, as, scenes, of, peasant, life, landscapes, townscapes, landscapes, with, animals, maritime, paintings, flower, paintings, and, still, lifes, of, various, types, the, development, of, many, of, these, types, of, painting, was, decisively, influenced, by, 17th, century, dutch, artists, the, widely, held, theory, of, the, hierarchy, of, genres, in, painting, whereby, some, types, were, regarded, as, more, prestigious, than, others, led, many, painters, to, want, to, produce, history, painting, however, this, was, the, hardest, to, sell, as, even, rembrandt, found, many, were, forced, to, produce, portraits, or, genre, scenes, which, sold, much, more, easily, in, descending, order, of, status, the, categories, in, the, hierarchy, were, the, dutch, concentrated, heavily, on, the, lower, categories, but, by, no, means, rejected, the, concept, of, the, hierarchy, most, paintings, were, relatively, small, the, only, common, type, of, really, large, paintings, were, group, portraits, painting, directly, onto, walls, hardly, existed, when, a, wall, space, in, a, public, building, needed, decorating, fitted, framed, canvas, was, normally, used, for, the, extra, precision, possible, on, a, hard, surface, many, painters, continued, to, use, wooden, panels, sometime, after, the, rest, of, western, europe, had, abandoned, them, some, used, copper, plates, usually, recycling, plates, from, printmaking, in, turn, the, number, of, surviving, golden, age, paintings, was, reduced, by, them, being, overpainted, with, new, works, by, artists, throughout, the, 18th, and, 19th, century, poor, ones, were, usually, cheaper, than, a, new, canvas, stretcher, and, frame, there, was, very, little, dutch, sculpture, during, the, period, it, is, mostly, found, in, tomb, monuments, and, attached, to, public, buildings, and, small, sculptures, for, houses, are, a, noticeable, gap, their, place, taken, by, silverware, and, ceramics, painted, delftware, tiles, were, very, cheap, and, common, if, rarely, of, really, high, quality, but, silver, especially, in, the, auricular, style, led, europe, with, this, exception, the, best, artistic, efforts, were, concentrated, on, painting, and, printmaking, foreigners, remarked, on, the, enormous, quantities, of, art, produced, and, the, large, fairs, where, many, paintings, were, sold, it, has, been, roughly, estimated, that, over, 1, 3, million, dutch, pictures, were, painted, in, the, 20, years, after, 1640, alone, the, volume, of, production, meant, that, prices, were, fairly, low, except, for, the, best, known, artists, as, in, most, subsequent, periods, there, was, a, steep, price, gradient, for, more, fashionable, artists, those, without, a, strong, contemporary, reputation, or, who, had, fallen, out, of, fashion, including, many, now, considered, among, the, greatest, of, the, period, such, as, vermeer, frans, hals, and, rembrandt, in, his, last, years, had, considerable, problems, earning, a, living, and, died, poor, many, artists, had, other, jobs, or, abandoned, art, entirely, in, particular, the, french, invasion, of, 1672, the, rampjaar, or, year, of, disaster, brought, a, severe, depression, to, the, art, market, which, never, quite, returned, to, earlier, heights, the, distribution, of, pictures, was, very, wide, yea, many, tymes, blacksmithes, cobblers, etts, will, have, some, picture, or, other, by, their, forge, and, in, their, stalle, such, is, the, generall, notion, enclination, and, delight, that, these, countrie, native, have, to, painting, reported, an, english, traveller, in, 1640, there, were, for, virtually, the, first, time, many, professional, art, dealers, several, also, significant, artists, like, vermeer, and, his, father, jan, van, goyen, and, willem, kalf, rembrandt, s, dealer, hendrick, van, uylenburgh, and, his, son, gerrit, were, among, the, most, important, landscapes, were, the, easiest, uncommissioned, works, to, sell, and, their, painters, were, the, common, footmen, in, the, army, of, art, according, to, samuel, van, hoogstraten, the, technical, quality, of, dutch, artists, was, generally, high, still, mostly, following, the, old, medieval, system, of, training, by, apprenticeship, with, a, master, typically, workshops, were, smaller, than, in, flanders, or, italy, with, only, one, or, two, apprentices, at, a, time, the, number, often, being, restricted, by, guild, regulations, the, turmoil, of, the, early, years, of, the, republic, with, displaced, artists, from, the, south, moving, north, and, the, loss, of, traditional, markets, in, the, court, and, church, led, to, a, resurgence, of, artists, guilds, often, still, called, the, guild, of, saint, luke, in, many, cases, these, involved, the, artists, extricating, themselves, from, medieval, groupings, where, they, shared, a, guild, with, several, other, trades, such, as, housepainting, several, new, guilds, were, established, in, the, period, amsterdam, in, 1579, haarlem, in, 1590, and, gouda, rotterdam, utrecht, and, delft, between, 1609, and, 1611, the, leiden, authorities, distrusted, guilds, and, did, not, allow, one, until, 1648, later, in, the, century, it, began, to, become, clear, to, all, involved, that, the, old, idea, of, a, guild, controlling, both, training, and, sales, no, longer, worked, well, and, gradually, the, guilds, were, replaced, with, academies, often, only, concerned, with, the, training, of, artists, the, hague, with, the, court, was, an, early, example, where, artists, split, into, two, groups, in, 1656, with, the, founding, of, the, confrerie, pictura, with, the, obvious, exception, of, portraits, many, more, dutch, paintings, were, done, speculatively, without, a, specific, commission, than, was, then, the, case, in, other, countries, one, of, many, ways, in, which, the, dutch, art, market, showed, the, future, there, were, many, dynasties, of, artists, and, many, married, the, daughters, of, their, masters, or, other, artists, many, artists, came, from, well, off, families, who, paid, fees, for, their, apprenticeships, and, they, often, married, into, property, rembrandt, and, jan, steen, were, both, enrolled, at, the, university, of, leiden, for, a, while, several, cities, had, distinct, styles, and, specialities, by, subject, but, amsterdam, was, the, largest, artistic, centre, because, of, its, great, wealth, cities, such, as, haarlem, and, utrecht, were, more, important, in, the, first, half, of, the, century, with, leiden, and, other, cities, emerging, after, 1648, and, above, all, amsterdam, which, increasingly, drew, to, it, artists, from, the, rest, of, the, netherlands, as, well, as, flanders, and, germany, dutch, artists, were, strikingly, less, concerned, about, artistic, theory, than, those, of, many, nations, and, less, given, to, discussing, their, art, it, appears, that, there, was, also, much, less, interest, in, artistic, theory, in, general, intellectual, circles, and, among, the, wider, public, than, was, by, then, common, in, italy, as, nearly, all, commissions, and, sales, were, private, and, between, bourgeois, individuals, whose, accounts, have, not, been, preserved, these, are, also, less, well, documented, than, elsewhere, but, dutch, art, was, a, source, of, national, pride, and, the, major, biographers, are, crucial, sources, of, information, these, are, karel, van, mander, het, schilderboeck, 1604, who, essentially, covers, the, previous, century, and, arnold, houbraken, de, groote, schouburgh, der, nederlantsche, konstschilders, en, schilderessen, the, great, theatre, of, dutch, painters, 1718, 21, both, followed, and, indeed, exceeded, vasari, in, including, a, great, number, of, short, lives, of, artists, over, 500, in, houbraken, s, case, and, both, are, considered, generally, accurate, on, factual, matters, the, german, artist, joachim, von, sandrart, 1606, 1688, had, worked, for, periods, in, holland, and, his, deutsche, akademie, in, the, same, format, covers, many, dutch, artists, he, knew, houbraken, s, master, and, rembrandt, s, pupil, was, samuel, van, hoogstraten, 1627, 1678, whose, zichtbare, wereld, and, inleyding, tot, de, hooge, schoole, der, schilderkonst, 1678, contain, more, critical, than, biographical, information, and, are, among, the, most, important, treatises, on, painting, of, the, period, like, other, dutch, works, on, the, theory, of, art, they, expound, many, commonplaces, of, renaissance, theory, and, do, not, entirely, reflect, contemporary, dutch, art, still, often, concentrating, on, history, painting, this, category, comprises, not, only, paintings, that, depicted, historical, events, of, the, past, but, also, paintings, that, showed, biblical, mythological, literary, and, allegorical, scenes, recent, historical, events, essentially, fell, out, of, the, category, and, were, treated, in, a, realist, fashion, as, the, appropriate, combination, of, portraits, with, marine, townscape, or, landscape, subjects, large, dramatic, historical, or, biblical, scenes, were, produced, less, frequently, than, in, other, countries, as, there, was, no, local, market, for, church, art, and, few, large, aristocratic, baroque, houses, to, fill, more, than, that, the, protestant, population, of, major, cities, had, been, exposed, to, some, remarkably, hypocritical, uses, of, mannerist, allegory, in, unsuccessful, habsburg, propaganda, during, the, dutch, revolt, which, had, produced, a, strong, reaction, towards, realism, and, a, distrust, of, grandiose, visual, rhetoric, history, painting, was, now, a, minority, art, although, to, an, extent, this, was, redressed, by, a, relatively, keen, interest, in, print, versions, of, history, subjects, more, than, in, other, types, of, painting, dutch, history, painters, continued, to, be, influenced, by, italian, painting, prints, and, copies, of, italian, masterpieces, circulated, and, suggested, certain, compositional, schemes, the, growing, dutch, skill, in, the, depiction, of, light, was, brought, to, bear, on, styles, derived, from, italy, notably, that, of, caravaggio, some, dutch, painters, also, travelled, to, italy, though, this, was, less, common, than, with, their, flemish, contemporaries, as, can, be, seen, from, the, membership, of, the, bentvueghels, club, in, rome, in, the, early, part, of, the, century, many, northern, mannerist, artists, with, styles, formed, in, the, previous, century, continued, to, work, until, the, 1630s, in, the, cases, of, abraham, bloemaert, and, joachim, wtewael, many, history, paintings, were, small, in, scale, with, the, german, painter, based, in, rome, adam, elsheimer, as, much, an, influence, as, caravaggio, both, died, in, 1610, on, dutch, painters, like, pieter, lastman, rembrandt, s, master, and, jan, and, jacob, pynas, compared, to, baroque, history, painting, from, other, countries, they, shared, the, dutch, emphasis, on, realism, and, narrative, directness, and, are, sometimes, known, as, the, pre, rembrandtists, as, rembrandt, s, early, paintings, were, in, this, style, utrecht, caravaggism, describes, a, group, of, artists, who, produced, both, history, painting, and, generally, large, genre, scenes, in, an, italian, influenced, style, often, making, heavy, use, of, chiaroscuro, utrecht, before, the, revolt, the, most, important, city, in, the, new, dutch, territory, was, an, unusual, dutch, city, still, about, 40, catholic, in, the, mid, century, even, more, among, the, elite, groups, who, included, many, rural, nobility, and, gentry, with, town, houses, there, the, leading, artists, were, hendrick, ter, brugghen, gerard, van, honthorst, and, dirck, van, baburen, and, the, school, was, active, about, 1630, although, van, honthorst, continued, until, the, 1650s, as, a, successful, court, painter, to, the, english, dutch, and, danish, courts, in, a, more, classical, style, rembrandt, began, as, a, history, painter, before, finding, financial, success, as, a, portraitist, and, he, never, relinquished, his, ambitions, in, this, area, a, great, number, of, his, etchings, are, of, narrative, religious, scenes, and, the, story, of, his, last, history, commission, the, conspiracy, of, claudius, civilis, 1661, illustrates, both, his, commitment, to, the, form, and, the, difficulties, he, had, in, finding, an, audience, several, artists, many, his, pupils, attempted, with, some, success, to, continue, his, very, personal, style, govaert, flinck, was, the, most, successful, gerard, de, lairesse, 1640, 1711, was, another, of, these, before, falling, under, heavy, influence, from, french, classicism, and, becoming, its, leading, dutch, proponent, as, both, artist, and, theoretician, nudity, was, effectively, the, preserve, of, the, history, painter, although, many, portraitists, dressed, up, their, occasional, nudes, nearly, always, female, with, a, classical, title, as, rembrandt, did, for, all, their, uninhibited, suggestiveness, genre, painters, rarely, revealed, more, than, a, generous, cleavage, or, stretch, of, thigh, usually, when, painting, prostitutes, or, italian, peasants, portrait, painting, thrived, in, the, netherlands, in, the, 17th, century, as, there, was, a, large, mercantile, class, who, were, far, more, ready, to, commission, portraits, than, their, equivalents, in, other, countries, a, summary, of, various, estimates, of, total, production, arrives, at, between, 750, 000, and, 1, 100, 000, portraits, rembrandt, enjoyed, his, greatest, period, of, financial, success, as, a, young, amsterdam, portraitist, but, like, other, artists, grew, rather, bored, with, painting, commissioned, portraits, of, burghers, artists, travel, along, this, road, without, delight, according, to, van, mander, while, dutch, portrait, painting, avoids, the, swagger, and, excessive, rhetoric, of, the, aristocratic, baroque, portraiture, current, in, the, rest, of, 17th, century, europe, the, sombre, clothing, of, male, and, in, many, cases, female, sitters, and, the, calvinist, feeling, that, the, inclusion, of, props, possessions, or, views, of, land, in, the, background, would, show, the, sin, of, pride, leads, to, an, undeniable, sameness, in, many, dutch, portraits, for, all, their, technical, quality, even, a, standing, pose, is, usually, avoided, as, a, full, length, might, also, show, pride, poses, are, undemonstrative, especially, for, women, though, children, may, be, allowed, more, freedom, the, classic, moment, for, having, a, portrait, painted, was, upon, marriage, when, the, new, husband, and, wife, more, often, than, not, occupied, separate, frames, in, a, pair, of, paintings, rembrandt, s, later, portraits, compel, by, force, of, characterization, and, sometimes, a, narrative, element, but, even, his, early, portraits, can, be, dispiriting, en, masse, as, in, the, roomful, of, starter, rembrandts, donated, to, the, metropolitan, museum, of, art, in, new, york, the, other, great, portraitist, of, the, period, is, frans, hals, whose, famously, lively, brushwork, and, ability, to, show, sitters, looking, relaxed, and, cheerful, adds, excitement, to, even, the, most, unpromising, subjects, the, extremely, nonchalant, pose, of, his, portrait, of, willem, heythuijsen, is, exceptional, no, other, portrait, from, this, period, is, so, informal, the, sitter, was, a, wealthy, textile, merchant, who, had, already, commissioned, hals, only, individual, life, sized, full, length, portrait, ten, years, before, in, this, much, smaller, work, for, a, private, chamber, he, wears, riding, clothes, jan, de, bray, encouraged, his, sitters, to, pose, costumed, as, figures, from, classical, history, but, many, of, his, works, are, of, his, own, family, thomas, de, keyser, bartholomeus, van, der, helst, ferdinand, bol, and, others, including, many, mentioned, below, as, history, or, genre, painters, did, their, best, to, enliven, more, conventional, works, portraiture, less, affected, by, fashion, than, other, types, of, painting, remained, the, safe, fallback, for, dutch, artists, from, what, little, we, know, of, the, studio, procedures, of, artists, it, seems, that, as, elsewhere, in, europe, the, face, was, probably, drawn, and, perhaps, painted, at, an, initial, sitting, or, two, the, typical, number, of, further, sittings, is, unclear, between, zero, for, a, rembrandt, full, length, and, 50, appear, documented, the, clothes, were, left, at, the, studio, and, might, well, be, painted, by, assistants, or, a, brought, in, specialist, master, although, or, because, they, were, regarded, as, a, very, important, part, of, the, painting, married, and, never, married, women, can, be, distinguished, by, their, dress, highlighting, how, few, single, women, were, painted, except, in, family, groups, as, elsewhere, the, accuracy, of, the, clothes, shown, is, variable, striped, and, patterned, clothes, were, worn, but, artists, rarely, show, them, understandably, avoiding, the, extra, work, lace, and, ruff, collars, were, unavoidable, and, presented, a, formidable, challenge, to, painters, intent, on, realism, rembrandt, evolved, a, more, effective, way, of, painting, patterned, lace, laying, in, broad, white, stokes, and, then, painting, lightly, in, black, to, show, the, pattern, another, way, of, doing, this, was, to, paint, in, white, over, a, black, layer, and, scratch, off, the, white, with, the, end, of, the, brush, to, show, the, pattern, at, the, end, of, the, century, there, was, a, fashion, for, showing, sitters, in, a, semi, fancy, dress, begun, in, england, by, van, dyck, in, the, 1630s, known, as, picturesque, or, roman, dress, aristocratic, and, militia, sitters, allowed, themselves, more, freedom, in, bright, dress, and, expansive, settings, than, burghers, and, religious, affiliations, probably, affected, many, depictions, by, the, end, of, the, century, aristocratic, or, french, values, were, spreading, among, the, burghers, and, depictions, were, allowed, more, freedom, and, display, a, distinctive, type, of, painting, combining, elements, of, the, portrait, history, and, genre, painting, was, the, tronie, this, was, usually, a, half, length, of, a, single, figure, which, concentrated, on, capturing, an, unusual, mood, or, expression, the, actual, identity, of, the, model, was, not, supposed, to, be, important, but, they, might, represent, a, historical, figure, and, be, in, exotic, or, historic, costume, jan, lievens, and, rembrandt, many, of, whose, self, portraits, are, also, tronies, especially, his, etched, ones, were, among, those, who, developed, the, genre, family, portraits, tended, as, in, flanders, to, be, set, outdoors, in, gardens, but, without, an, extensive, view, as, later, in, england, and, to, be, relatively, informal, in, dress, and, mood, group, portraits, largely, a, dutch, invention, were, popular, among, the, large, numbers, of, civic, associations, that, were, a, notable, part, of, dutch, life, such, as, the, officers, of, a, city, s, schutterij, or, militia, guards, boards, of, trustees, and, regents, of, guilds, and, charitable, foundations, and, the, like, especially, in, the, first, half, of, the, century, portraits, were, very, formal, and, stiff, in, composition, groups, were, often, seated, around, a, table, each, person, looking, at, the, viewer, much, attention, was, paid, to, fine, details, in, clothing, and, where, applicable, to, furniture, and, other, signs, of, a, person, s, position, in, society, later, in, the, century, groups, became, livelier, and, colours, brighter, rembrandt, s, syndics, of, the, drapers, guild, is, a, subtle, treatment, of, a, group, round, a, table, scientists, often, posed, with, instruments, and, objects, of, their, study, around, them, physicians, sometimes, posed, together, around, a, cadaver, a, so, called, anatomical, lesson, the, most, famous, one, being, rembrandt, s, anatomy, lesson, of, dr, nicolaes, tulp, 1632, mauritshuis, the, hague, boards, of, trustees, in, their, regentenstuk, portraits, preferred, an, image, of, austerity, and, humility, posing, in, dark, clothing, which, by, its, refinement, testified, to, their, prominent, standing, in, society, often, seated, around, a, table, with, solemn, expressions, on, their, faces, most, militia, group, portraits, were, commissioned, in, haarlem, and, amsterdam, and, were, much, more, flamboyant, and, relaxed, or, even, boisterous, than, other, types, of, portraits, as, well, as, much, larger, early, examples, showed, them, dining, but, later, groups, showed, most, figures, standing, for, a, more, dynamic, composition, rembrandt, s, famous, the, militia, company, of, captain, frans, banning, cocq, better, known, as, the, night, watch, 1642, was, an, ambitious, and, not, entirely, successful, attempt, to, show, a, group, in, action, setting, out, for, a, patrol, or, parade, also, innovative, in, avoiding, the, typical, very, wide, format, of, such, works, the, cost, of, group, portraits, was, usually, shared, by, the, subjects, often, not, equally, the, amount, paid, might, determine, each, person, s, place, in, the, picture, either, head, to, toe, in, full, regalia, in, the, foreground, or, face, only, in, the, back, of, the, group, sometimes, all, group, members, paid, an, equal, sum, which, was, likely, to, lead, to, quarrels, when, some, members, gained, a, more, prominent, place, in, the, picture, than, others, in, amsterdam, most, of, these, paintings, would, ultimately, end, up, in, the, possession, of, the, city, council, and, many, are, now, on, display, in, the, amsterdams, historisch, museum, there, are, no, significant, examples, outside, the, netherlands, scenes, of, everyday, life, now, called, genre, paintings, prominently, feature, figures, to, whom, no, specific, identity, can, be, attached, they, are, not, portraits, or, intended, as, historical, figures, but, rather, snapshots, of, quotidian, life, together, with, landscape, painting, the, development, and, enormous, popularity, of, genre, painting, is, the, most, distinctive, feature, of, dutch, painting, in, this, period, although, in, this, case, they, were, also, very, popular, in, flemish, painting, many, are, single, figures, such, as, vermeer, s, the, milkmaid, others, may, show, large, groups, at, some, social, occasion, or, crowds, seventeenth, century, holland, produced, more, and, better, artists, dedicated, to, genre, painting, with, and, without, messages, than, any, other, nation, there, were, a, large, number, of, sub, types, within, the, genre, single, figures, peasant, families, tavern, scenes, merry, company, parties, women, at, work, about, the, house, scenes, of, village, or, town, festivities, though, these, were, still, more, common, in, flemish, painting, market, scenes, barracks, scenes, scenes, with, horses, or, farm, animals, in, snow, by, moonlight, and, many, more, in, fact, most, of, these, had, specific, terms, in, dutch, but, there, was, no, overall, dutch, term, equivalent, to, genre, painting, until, the, late, 18th, century, the, english, often, called, them, drolleries, some, artists, worked, mostly, within, one, of, these, sub, types, especially, after, about, 1625, over, the, course, of, the, century, genre, paintings, tended, to, reduce, in, size, though, genre, paintings, provide, many, insights, into, the, daily, life, of, 17th, century, citizens, of, all, classes, their, accuracy, cannot, always, be, taken, for, granted, typically, they, show, what, art, historians, term, a, reality, effect, rather, than, an, actual, realist, depiction, the, degree, to, which, this, is, the, case, varies, between, artists, many, paintings, which, seem, only, to, depict, everyday, scenes, actually, illustrated, dutch, proverbs, and, sayings, or, conveyed, a, moralistic, message, the, meaning, of, which, may, now, need, to, be, deciphered, by, art, historians, though, some, are, clear, enough, many, artists, and, no, doubt, purchasers, certainly, tried, to, have, things, both, ways, enjoying, the, depiction, of, disorderly, households, or, brothel, scenes, while, providing, a, moral, interpretation, the, works, of, jan, steen, whose, other, profession, was, as, an, innkeeper, are, an, example, the, balance, between, these, elements, is, still, debated, by, art, historians, today, the, titles, given, later, to, paintings, often, distinguish, between, taverns, or, inns, and, brothels, but, in, practice, these, were, very, often, the, same, establishments, as, many, taverns, had, rooms, above, or, behind, set, aside, for, sexual, purposes, inn, in, front, brothel, behind, was, a, dutch, proverb, the, steen, above, is, very, clearly, an, exemplum, and, though, each, of, the, individual, components, of, it, is, realistically, depicted, the, overall, scene, is, not, a, plausible, depiction, of, a, real, moment, typically, of, genre, painting, it, is, a, situation, that, is, depicted, and, satirized, the, renaissance, tradition, of, recondite, emblem, books, had, in, the, hands, of, the, 17th, century, dutch, almost, universally, literate, in, the, vernacular, but, mostly, without, education, in, the, classics, turned, into, the, popularist, and, highly, moralistic, works, of, jacob, cats, roemer, visscher, and, others, often, based, in, popular, proverbs, the, illustrations, to, these, are, often, quoted, directly, in, paintings, and, since, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, art, historians, have, attached, proverbs, sayings, and, mottoes, to, a, great, number, of, genre, works, another, popular, source, of, meaning, is, visual, puns, using, the, great, number, of, dutch, slang, terms, in, the, sexual, area, the, vagina, could, be, represented, by, a, lute, luit, or, stocking, kous, and, sex, by, a, bird, vogelen, among, many, other, options, and, purely, visual, symbols, such, as, shoes, spouts, and, jugs, and, flagons, on, their, side, the, same, painters, often, painted, works, in, a, very, different, spirit, of, housewives, or, other, women, at, rest, in, the, home, or, at, work, they, massively, outnumber, similar, treatments, of, men, in, fact, working, class, men, going, about, their, jobs, are, notably, absent, from, dutch, golden, age, art, with, landscapes, populated, by, travellers, and, idlers, but, rarely, tillers, of, the, soil, despite, the, dutch, republic, being, the, most, important, nation, in, international, trade, in, europe, and, the, abundance, of, marine, paintings, scenes, of, dock, workers, and, other, commercial, activities, are, very, rare, this, group, of, subjects, was, a, dutch, invention, reflecting, the, cultural, preoccupations, of, the, age, and, was, to, be, adopted, by, artists, from, other, countries, especially, france, in, the, two, centuries, following, the, tradition, developed, from, the, realism, and, detailed, background, activity, of, early, netherlandish, painting, which, hieronymus, bosch, and, pieter, bruegel, the, elder, were, among, the, first, to, turn, into, their, principal, subjects, also, making, use, of, proverbs, the, haarlem, painters, willem, pieterszoon, buytewech, frans, hals, and, esaias, van, de, velde, were, important, painters, early, in, the, period, buytewech, painted, merry, companies, of, finely, dressed, young, people, with, moralistic, significance, lurking, in, the, detail, van, de, velde, was, also, important, as, a, landscapist, whose, scenes, included, unglamorous, figures, very, different, from, those, in, his, genre, paintings, which, were, typically, set, at, garden, parties, in, country, houses, hals, was, principally, a, portraitist, but, also, painted, genre, figures, of, a, portrait, size, early, in, his, career, a, stay, in, haarlem, by, the, flemish, master, of, peasant, tavern, scenes, adriaen, brouwer, from, 1625, or, 1626, gave, adriaen, van, ostade, his, lifelong, subject, though, he, often, took, a, more, sentimental, approach, before, brouwer, peasants, had, normally, been, depicted, outdoors, he, usually, shows, them, in, a, plain, and, dim, interior, though, van, ostade, s, sometimes, occupy, ostentatiously, decrepit, farmhouses, of, enormous, size, van, ostade, was, as, likely, to, paint, a, single, figure, as, a, group, as, were, the, utrecht, caravaggisti, in, their, genre, works, and, the, single, figure, or, small, groups, of, two, or, three, became, increasingly, common, especially, those, including, women, and, children, the, most, notable, woman, artist, of, the, period, judith, leyster, 1609, 1660, specialized, in, these, before, her, husband, jan, miense, molenaer, prevailed, on, her, to, give, up, painting, the, leiden, school, of, fijnschilder, fine, painters, were, renowned, for, small, and, highly, finished, paintings, many, of, this, type, leading, artists, included, gerard, dou, gabriel, metsu, frans, van, mieris, the, elder, and, later, his, son, willem, van, mieris, godfried, schalcken, and, adriaen, van, der, werff, this, later, generation, whose, work, now, seems, over, refined, compared, to, their, predecessors, also, painted, portraits, and, histories, and, were, the, most, highly, regarded, and, rewarded, dutch, painters, by, the, end, of, the, period, whose, works, were, sought, after, all, over, europe, genre, paintings, reflected, the, increasing, prosperity, of, dutch, society, and, settings, grew, steadily, more, comfortable, opulent, and, carefully, depicted, as, the, century, progressed, artists, not, part, of, the, leiden, group, whose, common, subjects, also, were, more, intimate, genre, groups, included, nicolaes, maes, gerard, ter, borch, and, pieter, de, hooch, whose, interest, in, light, in, interior, scenes, was, shared, with, jan, vermeer, long, a, very, obscure, figure, but, now, the, most, highly, regarded, genre, painter, of, all, landscape, painting, was, a, major, genre, in, the, 17th, century, flemish, landscapes, particularly, from, antwerp, of, the, 16th, century, first, served, as, an, example, these, had, been, not, particularly, realistic, having, been, painted, mostly, in, the, studio, partly, from, imagination, and, often, still, using, the, semi, aerial, view, from, above, typical, of, earlier, netherlandish, landscape, painting, in, the, world, landscape, tradition, of, joachim, patinir, herri, met, de, bles, and, the, early, pieter, bruegel, the, elder, a, more, realistic, dutch, landscape, style, developed, seen, from, ground, level, often, based, on, drawings, made, outdoors, with, lower, horizons, which, made, it, possible, to, emphasize, the, often, impressive, cloud, formations, that, were, and, are, so, typical, in, the, climate, of, the, region, and, which, cast, a, particular, light, favourite, subjects, were, the, dunes, along, the, western, seacoast, rivers, with, their, broad, adjoining, meadows, where, cattle, grazed, often, with, the, silhouette, of, a, city, in, the, distance, winter, landscapes, with, frozen, canals, and, creeks, also, abounded, the, sea, was, a, favourite, topic, as, well, since, the, low, countries, depended, on, it, for, trade, battled, with, it, for, new, land, and, battled, on, it, with, competing, nations, important, early, figures, in, the, move, to, realism, were, esaias, van, de, velde, 1587, 1630, and, hendrick, avercamp, 1585, 1634, both, also, mentioned, above, as, genre, painters, in, avercamp, s, case, the, same, paintings, deserve, mention, in, each, category, from, the, late, 1620s, the, tonal, phase, of, landscape, painting, started, as, artists, softened, or, blurred, their, outlines, and, concentrated, on, an, atmospheric, effect, with, great, prominence, given, to, the, sky, and, human, figures, usually, either, absent, or, small, and, distant, compositions, based, on, a, diagonal, across, the, picture, space, became, popular, and, water, often, featured, the, leading, artists, were, jan, van, goyen, 1596, 1656, salomon, van, ruysdael, 1602, 1670, pieter, de, molyn, 1595, 1661, and, in, marine, painting, simon, de, vlieger, 1601, 1653, with, a, host, of, minor, figures, a, recent, study, lists, over, 75, artists, who, worked, in, van, goyen, s, manner, for, at, least, a, period, including, cuyp, from, the, 1650s, the, classical, phase, began, retaining, the, atmospheric, quality, but, with, more, expressive, compositions, and, stronger, contrasts, of, light, and, colour, compositions, are, often, anchored, by, a, single, heroic, tree, windmill, or, tower, or, ship, in, marine, works, the, leading, artist, was, jacob, van, ruisdael, 1628, 1682, who, produced, a, great, quantity, and, variety, of, work, using, every, typical, dutch, subject, except, the, italianate, landscape, below, instead, he, produced, nordic, landscapes, of, dark, and, dramatic, mountain, pine, forests, with, rushing, torrents, and, waterfalls, his, pupil, was, meindert, hobbema, 1638, 1709, best, known, for, his, atypical, avenue, at, middelharnis, 1689, london, a, departure, from, his, usual, scenes, of, watermills, and, roads, through, woods, two, other, artists, with, more, personal, styles, whose, best, work, included, larger, pictures, up, to, a, metre, or, more, across, were, aelbert, cuyp, 1620, 1691, and, philips, koninck, 1619, 1688, cuyp, took, golden, italian, light, and, used, it, in, evening, scenes, with, a, group, of, figures, in, the, foreground, and, behind, them, a, river, and, wide, landscape, koninck, s, best, works, are, panoramic, views, as, from, a, hill, over, wide, flat, farmlands, with, a, huge, sky, a, different, type, of, landscape, produced, throughout, the, tonal, and, classical, phases, was, the, romantic, italianate, landscape, typically, in, more, mountainous, settings, than, are, found, in, the, netherlands, with, golden, light, and, sometimes, picturesque, mediterranean, staffage, and, ruins, not, all, the, artists, who, specialized, in, these, had, visited, italy, jan, both, d, 1652, who, had, been, to, rome, and, worked, with, claude, lorrain, was, a, leading, developer, of, the, subgenre, which, influenced, the, work, of, many, painters, of, landscapes, with, dutch, settings, such, as, aelbert, cuyp, other, artists, who, consistently, worked, in, the, style, were, nicolaes, berchem, 1620, 1683, and, adam, pijnacker, italianate, landscapes, were, popular, as, prints, and, more, paintings, by, berchem, were, reproduced, in, engravings, during, the, period, itself, than, those, of, any, other, artist, a, number, of, other, artists, do, not, fit, in, any, of, these, groups, above, all, rembrandt, whose, relatively, few, painted, landscapes, show, various, influences, including, some, from, hercules, seghers, c, 1589, c, 1638, his, very, rare, large, mountain, valley, landscapes, were, a, very, personal, development, of, 16th, century, styles, aert, van, der, neer, d, 1677, painted, very, small, scenes, of, rivers, at, night, or, under, ice, and, snow, landscapes, with, animals, in, the, foreground, were, a, distinct, sub, type, and, were, painted, by, cuyp, paulus, potter, 1625, 1654, albert, jansz, klomp, 1625, 1688, adriaen, van, de, velde, 1636, 1672, and, karel, dujardin, 1626, 1678, farm, animals, with, philips, wouwerman, painting, horses, and, riders, in, various, settings, the, cow, was, a, symbol, of, prosperity, to, the, dutch, hitherto, overlooked, in, art, and, apart, from, the, horse, by, far, the, most, commonly, shown, animal, goats, were, used, to, indicate, italy, potter, s, the, young, bull, is, an, enormous, and, famous, portrait, which, napoleon, took, to, paris, it, later, returned, though, livestock, analysts, have, noted, from, the, depiction, of, the, various, parts, of, the, anatomy, that, it, appears, to, be, a, composite, of, studies, of, six, different, animals, of, widely, different, ages, architecture, also, fascinated, the, dutch, churches, in, particular, at, the, start, of, the, period, the, main, tradition, was, of, fanciful, palaces, and, city, views, of, invented, northern, mannerist, architecture, which, flemish, painting, continued, to, develop, and, in, holland, was, represented, by, dirck, van, delen, a, greater, realism, began, to, appear, and, the, exteriors, and, interiors, of, actual, buildings, were, reproduced, though, not, always, faithfully, during, the, century, understanding, of, the, proper, rendering, of, perspective, grew, and, were, enthusiastically, applied, several, artists, specialized, in, church, interiors, pieter, jansz, saenredam, whose, father, jan, saenredam, engraved, sensuous, nude, mannerist, goddesses, painted, unpeopled, views, of, now, whitewashed, gothic, city, churches, his, emphasis, on, even, light, and, geometry, with, little, depiction, of, surface, textures, is, brought, out, by, comparing, his, works, with, those, of, emanuel, de, witte, who, left, in, the, people, uneven, floors, contrasts, of, light, and, such, clutter, of, church, furniture, as, remained, in, calvinist, churches, all, usually, ignored, by, saenredam, gerard, houckgeest, followed, by, van, witte, and, hendrick, van, vliet, had, supplemented, the, traditional, view, along, a, main, axis, of, the, church, with, diagonal, views, that, added, drama, and, interest, gerrit, berckheyde, specialized, in, lightly, populated, views, of, main, city, streets, squares, and, major, public, buildings, jan, van, der, heyden, preferred, more, intimate, scenes, of, quieter, amsterdam, streets, often, with, trees, and, canals, these, were, real, views, but, he, did, not, hesitate, to, adjust, them, for, compositional, effect, the, dutch, republic, relied, on, trade, by, sea, for, its, exceptional, wealth, had, naval, wars, with, britain, and, other, nations, during, the, period, and, was, criss, crossed, by, rivers, and, canals, it, is, therefore, no, surprise, that, the, genre, of, maritime, painting, was, enormously, popular, and, taken, to, new, heights, in, the, period, by, dutch, artists, as, with, landscapes, the, move, from, the, artificial, elevated, view, typical, of, earlier, marine, painting, was, a, crucial, step, pictures, of, sea, battles, told, the, stories, of, a, dutch, navy, at, the, peak, of, its, glory, though, today, it, is, usually, the, more, tranquil, scenes, that, are, highly, estimated, ships, are, normally, at, sea, and, dock, scenes, surprisingly, absent, more, often, than, not, even, small, ships, fly, the, dutch, tricolour, and, many, vessels, can, be, identified, as, naval, or, one, of, the, many, other, government, ships, many, pictures, included, some, land, with, a, beach, or, harbour, viewpoint, or, a, view, across, an, estuary, other, artists, specialized, in, river, scenes, from, the, small, pictures, of, salomon, van, ruysdael, with, little, boats, and, reed, banks, to, the, large, italianate, landscapes, of, aelbert, cuyp, where, the, sun, is, usually, setting, over, a, wide, river, the, genre, naturally, shares, much, with, landscape, painting, and, in, developing, the, depiction, of, the, sky, the, two, went, together, many, landscape, artists, also, painted, beach, and, river, scenes, artists, included, jan, porcellis, simon, de, vlieger, jan, van, de, cappelle, hendrick, dubbels, and, abraham, storck, willem, van, de, velde, the, elder, and, his, son, are, the, leading, masters, of, the, later, decades, tending, as, at, the, beginning, of, the, century, to, make, the, ship, the, subject, whereas, in, tonal, works, of, earlier, decades, the, emphasis, had, been, on, the, sea, and, the, weather, they, left, for, london, in, 1672, leaving, the, master, of, heavy, seas, the, german, born, ludolf, bakhuizen, as, the, leading, artist, still, lifes, were, a, great, opportunity, to, display, skill, in, painting, textures, and, surfaces, in, great, detail, and, with, realistic, light, effects, food, of, all, kinds, laid, out, on, a, table, silver, cutlery, intricate, patterns, and, subtle, folds, in, tablecloths, and, flowers, all, challenged, painters, dutch, painters, produced, still, lifes, in, great, numbers, revealing, the, dutch, love, of, domestic, culture, the, english, term, derives, from, the, dutch, word, stilleven, which, came, into, use, about, 1650, several, types, of, subject, were, recognised, banketje, were, banquet, pieces, ontbijtjes, simpler, breakfast, pieces, virtually, all, still, lifes, had, a, moralistic, message, usually, concerning, the, brevity, of, life, this, is, known, as, the, vanitas, theme, implicit, even, in, the, absence, of, an, obvious, symbol, like, a, skull, or, less, obvious, one, such, as, a, half, peeled, lemon, like, life, sweet, in, appearance, but, bitter, to, taste, flowers, wilt, and, food, decays, and, silver, is, of, no, use, to, the, soul, nevertheless, the, force, of, this, message, seems, less, powerful, in, the, more, elaborate, pieces, of, the, second, half, of, the, century, initially, the, objects, shown, were, nearly, always, mundane, however, from, the, mid, century, pronkstillevens, ostentatious, still, lifes, which, depicted, expensive, and, exotic, objects, and, had, been, developed, as, a, subgenre, in, the, 1640s, in, antwerp, by, flemish, artists, such, as, frans, snyders, and, adriaen, van, utrecht, became, more, popular, the, early, realist, tonal, and, classical, phases, of, landscape, painting, had, counterparts, in, still, life, painting, willem, claeszoon, heda, 1595, c, 1680, and, willem, kalf, 1619, 1693, led, the, change, to, the, pronkstilleven, while, pieter, claesz, d, 1660, preferred, to, paint, simpler, ontbijt, breakfast, pieces, or, explicit, vanitas, pieces, in, all, these, painters, colours, are, often, very, muted, with, browns, dominating, especially, in, the, middle, of, the, century, this, is, less, true, of, the, works, of, jan, davidsz, de, heem, 1606, 1684, an, important, figure, who, spent, much, of, his, career, based, over, the, border, in, antwerp, here, his, displays, began, to, sprawl, sideways, to, form, wide, oblong, pictures, unusual, in, the, north, although, heda, sometimes, painted, taller, vertical, compositions, still, life, painters, were, especially, prone, to, form, dynasties, it, seems, there, were, many, de, heems, and, bosschaerts, heda, s, son, continued, in, his, father, s, style, and, claesz, was, the, father, of, nicholaes, berchem, flower, paintings, formed, a, sub, group, with, its, own, specialists, and, were, occasionally, the, speciality, of, the, few, women, artists, such, as, maria, van, oosterwyck, and, rachel, ruysch, the, dutch, also, led, the, world, in, botanical, and, other, scientific, drawings, prints, and, book, illustrations, despite, the, intense, realism, of, individual, flowers, paintings, were, composed, from, individual, studies, or, even, book, illustrations, and, blooms, from, very, different, seasons, were, routinely, included, in, the, same, composition, and, the, same, flowers, reappear, in, different, works, just, as, pieces, of, tableware, do, there, was, also, a, fundamental, unreality, in, that, bouquets, of, flowers, in, vases, were, not, in, fact, at, all, common, in, houses, at, the, time, even, the, very, rich, displayed, flowers, one, by, one, in, delftware, tulip, holders, the, dutch, tradition, was, largely, begun, by, ambrosius, bosschaert, 1573, 1621, a, flemish, born, flower, painter, who, had, settled, in, the, north, by, the, beginning, of, the, period, and, founded, a, dynasty, his, brother, in, law, balthasar, van, der, ast, d, 1657, pioneered, still, lifes, of, shells, as, well, as, painting, flowers, these, early, works, were, relatively, brightly, lit, with, the, bouquets, of, flowers, arranged, in, a, relatively, simple, way, from, the, mid, century, arrangements, that, can, fairly, be, called, baroque, usually, against, a, dark, background, became, more, popular, exemplified, by, the, works, of, willem, van, aelst, 1627, 1683, painters, from, leiden, the, hague, and, amsterdam, particularly, excelled, in, the, genre, dead, game, and, birds, painted, live, but, studied, from, the, dead, were, another, subgenre, as, were, dead, fish, a, staple, of, the, dutch, diet, abraham, van, beijeren, did, many, of, these, the, dutch, were, less, given, to, the, flemish, style, of, combining, large, still, life, elements, with, other, types, of, painting, they, would, have, been, considered, prideful, in, portraits, and, the, flemish, habit, of, specialist, painters, collaborating, on, the, different, elements, in, the, same, work, but, this, sometimes, did, happen, philips, wouwerman, was, occasionally, used, to, add, men, and, horses, to, turn, a, landscape, into, a, hunting, or, skirmish, scene, berchem, or, adriaen, van, de, velde, to, add, people, or, farm, animals, for, dutch, artists, karel, van, mander, s, schilderboeck, was, meant, not, only, as, a, list, of, biographies, but, also, a, source, of, advice, for, young, artists, it, quickly, became, a, classic, standard, work, for, generations, of, young, dutch, and, flemish, artists, in, the, 17th, century, the, book, advised, artists, to, travel, and, see, the, sights, of, florence, and, rome, and, after, 1604, many, did, so, however, it, is, noticeable, that, the, most, important, dutch, artists, in, all, fields, figures, such, as, rembrandt, vermeer, hals, steen, jacob, van, ruisdael, and, others, had, not, made, the, voyage, many, dutch, and, flemish, painters, worked, abroad, or, exported, their, work, printmaking, was, also, an, important, export, market, by, which, rembrandt, became, known, across, europe, the, dutch, gift, to, charles, ii, of, england, was, a, diplomatic, gift, which, included, four, contemporary, dutch, paintings, english, painting, was, heavily, reliant, on, dutch, painters, with, sir, peter, lely, followed, by, sir, godfrey, kneller, developing, the, english, portrait, style, established, by, the, flemish, anthony, van, dyck, before, the, english, civil, war, the, marine, painters, van, der, velde, father, and, son, were, among, several, artists, who, left, holland, at, the, french, invasion, of, 1672, which, brought, a, collapse, in, the, art, market, they, also, moved, to, london, and, the, beginnings, of, english, landscape, painting, were, established, by, several, less, distinguished, dutch, painters, such, as, hendrick, danckerts, the, bamboccianti, were, a, colony, of, dutch, artists, who, introduced, the, genre, scene, to, italy, jan, weenix, and, melchior, d, hondecoeter, specialized, in, game, and, birds, dead, or, alive, and, were, in, demand, for, country, house, and, shooting, lodge, overdoors, across, northern, europe, although, the, dutch, control, of, the, northeast, sugar, producing, region, of, dutch, brazil, turned, out, to, be, brief, 1630, 54, governor, johan, maurits, van, nassau, siegen, invited, dutch, artists, to, paint, scenes, which, are, valuable, in, showing, the, seventeenth, century, landscape, and, peoples, of, the, region, the, two, most, well, known, of, these, artists, were, frans, post, a, landscapist, and, a, still, life, painter, albert, eckhout, who, produced, ethnographic, paintings, of, brazil, s, population, these, were, originally, displayed, in, the, great, hall, of, the, vrijburg, palace, in, recife, there, was, a, market, in, amsterdam, for, such, paintings, and, post, continued, to, produce, brazilian, scenes, for, years, after, his, return, to, the, netherlands, the, dutch, east, indies, were, covered, much, less, well, artistically, the, enormous, success, of, 17th, century, dutch, painting, overpowered, the, work, of, subsequent, generations, and, no, dutch, painter, of, the, 18th, century, nor, arguably, a, 19th, century, one, before, van, gogh, is, well, known, outside, the, netherlands, already, by, the, end, of, the, period, artists, were, complaining, that, buyers, were, more, interested, in, dead, than, living, artists, if, only, because, of, the, enormous, quantities, produced, dutch, golden, age, painting, has, always, formed, a, significant, part, of, collections, of, old, master, paintings, itself, a, term, invented, in, the, 18th, century, to, describe, dutch, golden, age, artists, taking, only, wouwerman, paintings, in, old, royal, collections, there, are, more, than, 60, in, dresden,
