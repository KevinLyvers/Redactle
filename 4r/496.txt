the, arts, and, crafts, movement, was, an, international, trend, in, the, decorative, and, fine, arts, that, developed, earliest, and, most, fully, in, the, british, isles, and, subsequently, spread, across, the, british, empire, and, to, the, rest, of, europe, and, america, initiated, in, reaction, against, the, perceived, impoverishment, of, the, decorative, arts, and, the, conditions, in, which, they, were, produced, the, movement, flourished, in, europe, and, north, america, between, about, 1880, and, 1920, some, consider, that, it, is, the, root, of, the, modern, style, a, british, expression, of, what, later, came, to, be, called, the, art, nouveau, movement, others, consider, that, it, is, the, incarnation, of, art, nouveau, in, england, others, consider, art, and, crafts, to, be, in, opposition, to, art, nouveau, arts, and, crafts, indeed, criticized, art, nouveau, for, its, use, of, industrial, materials, such, as, iron, and, as, for, art, nouveau, artists, the, arts, and, crafts, utopia, was, intrinsically, contradictory, the, paradoxical, confinement, of, the, arts, crafts, movement, in, an, artisanal, practice, was, completely, out, of, step, with, the, evolution, of, the, status, of, the, artist, decorator, but, also, with, the, democratic, will, of, an, art, for, the, people, and, by, the, people, proclaimed, by, william, morris, for, example, while, henry, van, de, velde, understood, the, social, discourse, of, arts, and, crafts, he, was, not, an, unconditional, disciple, of, the, movement, and, ended, up, turning, away, from, it, considering, it, as, anachronistic, and, tinged, with, quixotism, in, japan, it, emerged, in, the, 1920s, as, the, mingei, movement, it, stood, for, traditional, craftsmanship, and, often, used, medieval, romantic, or, folk, styles, of, decoration, it, advocated, economic, and, social, reform, and, was, anti, industrial, in, its, orientation, it, had, a, strong, influence, on, the, arts, in, europe, until, it, was, displaced, by, modernism, in, the, 1930s, and, its, influence, continued, among, craft, makers, designers, and, town, planners, long, afterwards, the, term, was, first, used, by, t, j, cobden, sanderson, at, a, meeting, of, the, arts, and, crafts, exhibition, society, in, 1887, although, the, principles, and, style, on, which, it, was, based, had, been, developing, in, england, for, at, least, 20, years, it, was, inspired, by, the, ideas, of, historian, thomas, carlyle, art, critic, john, ruskin, and, designer, william, morris, in, scotland, it, is, associated, with, key, figures, such, as, charles, rennie, mackintosh, viollet, le, duc, s, books, on, nature, and, gothique, art, also, play, an, essential, part, in, the, esthetics, of, the, arts, and, crafts, movement, the, arts, and, crafts, movement, emerged, from, the, attempt, to, reform, design, and, decoration, in, mid, 19th, century, britain, it, was, a, reaction, against, a, perceived, decline, in, standards, that, the, reformers, associated, with, machinery, and, factory, production, their, critique, was, sharpened, by, the, items, that, they, saw, in, the, great, exhibition, of, 1851, which, they, considered, to, be, excessively, ornate, artificial, and, ignorant, of, the, qualities, of, the, materials, used, art, historian, nikolaus, pevsner, writes, that, the, exhibits, showed, ignorance, of, that, basic, need, in, creating, patterns, the, integrity, of, the, surface, as, well, as, displaying, vulgarity, in, detail, design, reform, began, with, exhibition, organizers, henry, cole, 1808, 1882, owen, jones, 1809, 1874, matthew, digby, wyatt, 1820, 1877, and, richard, redgrave, 1804, 1888, all, of, whom, deprecated, excessive, ornament, and, impractical, or, badly, made, things, the, organizers, were, unanimous, in, their, condemnation, of, the, exhibits, owen, jones, for, example, complained, that, the, architect, the, upholsterer, the, paper, stainer, the, weaver, the, calico, printer, and, the, potter, produced, novelty, without, beauty, or, beauty, without, intelligence, from, these, criticisms, of, manufactured, goods, emerged, several, publications, that, set, out, what, the, writers, considered, to, be, the, correct, principles, of, design, richard, redgrave, s, supplementary, report, on, design, 1852, analysed, the, principles, of, design, and, ornament, and, pleaded, for, more, logic, in, the, application, of, decoration, other, works, followed, in, a, similar, vein, such, as, wyatt, s, industrial, arts, of, the, nineteenth, century, 1853, gottfried, semper, s, wissenschaft, industrie, und, kunst, science, industry, and, art, 1852, ralph, wornum, s, analysis, of, ornament, 1856, redgrave, s, manual, of, design, 1876, and, jones, s, grammar, of, ornament, 1856, the, grammar, of, ornament, was, particularly, influential, liberally, distributed, as, a, student, prize, and, running, into, nine, reprints, by, 1910, jones, declared, that, ornament, must, be, secondary, to, the, thing, decorated, that, there, must, be, fitness, in, the, ornament, to, the, thing, ornamented, and, that, wallpapers, and, carpets, must, not, have, any, patterns, suggestive, of, anything, but, a, level, or, plain, a, fabric, or, wallpaper, in, the, great, exhibition, might, be, decorated, with, a, natural, motif, made, to, look, as, real, as, possible, whereas, these, writers, advocated, flat, and, simplified, natural, motifs, redgrave, insisted, that, style, demanded, sound, construction, before, ornamentation, and, a, proper, awareness, of, the, quality, of, materials, used, utility, must, have, precedence, over, ornamentation, however, the, design, reformers, of, the, mid, 19th, century, did, not, go, as, far, as, the, designers, of, the, arts, and, crafts, movement, they, were, more, concerned, with, ornamentation, than, construction, they, had, an, incomplete, understanding, of, methods, of, manufacture, and, they, did, not, criticise, industrial, methods, as, such, by, contrast, the, arts, and, crafts, movement, was, as, much, a, movement, of, social, reform, as, design, reform, and, its, leading, practitioners, did, not, separate, the, two, some, of, the, ideas, of, the, movement, were, anticipated, by, augustus, pugin, 1812, 1852, a, leader, in, the, gothic, revival, in, architecture, for, example, he, advocated, truth, to, material, structure, and, function, as, did, the, arts, and, crafts, artists, pugin, articulated, the, tendency, of, social, critics, to, compare, the, faults, of, modern, society, with, the, middle, ages, such, as, the, sprawling, growth, of, cities, and, the, treatment, of, the, poor, a, tendency, that, became, routine, with, ruskin, morris, and, the, arts, and, crafts, movement, his, book, contrasts, 1836, drew, examples, of, bad, modern, buildings, and, town, planning, in, contrast, with, good, medieval, examples, and, his, biographer, rosemary, hill, notes, that, he, reached, conclusions, almost, in, passing, about, the, importance, of, craftsmanship, and, tradition, in, architecture, that, it, would, take, the, rest, of, the, century, and, the, combined, efforts, of, ruskin, and, morris, to, work, out, in, detail, she, describes, the, spare, furnishings, which, he, specified, for, a, building, in, 1841, rush, chairs, oak, tables, as, the, arts, and, crafts, interior, in, embryo, the, arts, and, crafts, philosophy, was, derived, in, large, measure, from, john, ruskin, s, social, criticism, deeply, influenced, by, the, work, of, thomas, carlyle, ruskin, related, the, moral, and, social, health, of, a, nation, to, the, qualities, of, its, architecture, and, to, the, nature, of, its, work, ruskin, considered, the, sort, of, mechanized, production, and, division, of, labour, that, had, been, created, in, the, industrial, revolution, to, be, servile, labour, and, he, thought, that, a, healthy, and, moral, society, required, independent, workers, who, designed, the, things, that, they, made, he, believed, factory, made, works, to, be, dishonest, and, that, handwork, and, craftsmanship, merged, dignity, with, labour, on, the, artistic, side, ruskin, was, influenced, by, his, contemporary, viollet, le, duc, whom, he, taught, to, all, of, his, pupils, in, a, letter, to, one, of, his, pupils, ruskin, writes, there, is, only, one, book, of, any, value, and, that, is, the, dictionnary, of, viollet, le, duc, everyone, should, learn, french, and, according, to, some, ruskin, s, influence, on, arts, and, crafts, was, supplanted, in, 1860, by, that, of, viollet, le, duc, his, followers, favoured, craft, production, over, industrial, manufacture, and, were, concerned, about, the, loss, of, traditional, skills, but, they, were, more, troubled, by, the, effects, of, the, factory, system, than, by, machinery, itself, william, morris, s, idea, of, handicraft, was, essentially, work, without, any, division, of, labour, rather, than, work, without, any, sort, of, machinery, morris, admired, ruskin, s, the, seven, lamps, of, architecture, and, the, stones, of, venice, but, was, uninterested, in, his, writings, on, painting, such, as, modern, painters, on, his, side, ruskin, dissented, firmly, from, the, idea, that, became, arts, and, crafts, orthodoxy, that, decoration, should, be, flat, and, should, not, represent, three, dimensional, forms, william, morris, 1834, 1896, was, the, towering, figure, in, late, 19th, century, design, and, the, main, influence, on, the, arts, and, crafts, movement, the, aesthetic, and, social, vision, of, the, movement, grew, out, of, ideas, that, he, developed, in, the, 1850s, with, the, birmingham, set, a, group, of, students, at, the, university, of, oxford, including, edward, burne, jones, who, combined, a, love, of, romantic, literature, with, a, commitment, to, social, reform, john, william, mackail, notes, that, carlyle, s, past, and, present, stood, alongside, of, modern, painters, as, inspired, and, absolute, truth, the, medievalism, of, malory, s, morte, d, arthur, set, the, standard, for, their, early, style, in, burne, jones, words, they, intended, to, wage, holy, warfare, against, the, age, morris, began, experimenting, with, various, crafts, and, designing, furniture, and, interiors, he, was, personally, involved, in, manufacture, as, well, as, design, which, was, the, hallmark, of, the, arts, and, crafts, movement, ruskin, had, argued, that, the, separation, of, the, intellectual, act, of, design, from, the, manual, act, of, physical, creation, was, both, socially, and, aesthetically, damaging, morris, further, developed, this, idea, insisting, that, no, work, should, be, carried, out, in, his, workshops, before, he, had, personally, mastered, the, appropriate, techniques, and, materials, arguing, that, without, dignified, creative, human, occupation, people, became, disconnected, from, life, in, 1861, morris, began, making, furniture, and, decorative, objects, commercially, modelling, his, designs, on, medieval, styles, and, using, bold, forms, and, strong, colours, his, patterns, were, based, on, flora, and, fauna, and, his, products, were, inspired, by, the, vernacular, or, domestic, traditions, of, the, british, countryside, some, were, deliberately, left, unfinished, in, order, to, display, the, beauty, of, the, materials, and, the, work, of, the, craftsman, thus, creating, a, rustic, appearance, morris, strove, to, unite, all, the, arts, within, the, decoration, of, the, home, emphasizing, nature, and, simplicity, of, form, unlike, their, counterparts, in, the, united, states, most, arts, and, crafts, practitioners, in, britain, had, strong, slightly, incoherent, negative, feelings, about, machinery, they, thought, of, the, craftsman, as, free, creative, and, working, with, his, hands, the, machine, as, soulless, repetitive, and, inhuman, these, contrasting, images, derive, in, part, from, john, ruskin, s, 1819, 1900, the, stones, of, venice, an, architectural, history, of, venice, that, contains, a, powerful, denunciation, of, modern, industrialism, to, which, arts, and, crafts, designers, returned, again, and, again, distrust, for, the, machine, lay, behind, the, many, little, workshops, that, turned, their, backs, on, the, industrial, world, around, 1900, using, preindustrial, techniques, to, create, what, they, called, crafts, alan, crawford, w, a, s, benson, machinery, and, the, arts, and, crafts, movement, in, britain, william, morris, shared, ruskin, s, critique, of, industrial, society, and, at, one, time, or, another, attacked, the, modern, factory, the, use, of, machinery, the, division, of, labor, capitalism, and, the, loss, of, traditional, craft, methods, but, his, attitude, to, machinery, was, inconsistent, he, said, at, one, point, that, production, by, machinery, was, altogether, an, evil, but, at, others, times, he, was, willing, to, commission, work, from, manufacturers, who, were, able, to, meet, his, standards, with, the, aid, of, machines, morris, said, that, in, a, true, society, where, neither, luxuries, nor, cheap, trash, were, made, machinery, could, be, improved, and, used, to, reduce, the, hours, of, labor, the, 19th, century, cultural, historian, fiona, mccarthy, said, of, morris, that, unlike, later, zealots, like, gandhi, william, morris, had, no, practical, objections, to, the, use, of, machinery, per, se, so, long, as, the, machines, produced, the, quality, he, needed, morris, insisted, that, the, artist, should, be, a, craftsman, designer, working, by, hand, and, advocated, a, society, of, free, craftspeople, such, as, he, believed, had, existed, during, the, middle, ages, because, craftsmen, took, pleasure, in, their, work, he, wrote, the, middle, ages, was, a, period, of, greatness, in, the, art, of, the, common, people, the, treasures, in, our, museums, now, are, only, the, common, utensils, used, in, households, of, that, age, when, hundreds, of, medieval, churches, each, one, a, masterpiece, were, built, by, unsophisticated, peasants, medieval, art, was, the, model, for, much, of, arts, and, crafts, design, and, medieval, life, literature, and, building, was, idealized, by, the, movement, morris, s, followers, also, had, differing, views, about, machinery, and, the, factory, system, for, example, c, r, ashbee, a, central, figure, in, the, arts, and, crafts, movement, said, in, 1888, that, we, do, not, reject, the, machine, we, welcome, it, but, we, would, desire, to, see, it, mastered, after, unsuccessfully, pitting, his, guild, and, school, of, handicraft, guild, against, modern, methods, of, manufacture, he, acknowledged, that, modern, civilisation, rests, on, machinery, but, he, continued, to, criticise, the, deleterious, effects, of, what, he, called, mechanism, saying, that, the, production, of, certain, mechanical, commodities, is, as, bad, for, the, national, health, as, is, the, production, of, slave, grown, cane, or, child, sweated, wares, william, arthur, smith, benson, on, the, other, hand, had, no, qualms, about, adapting, the, arts, and, crafts, style, to, metalwork, produced, under, industrial, conditions, see, quotation, box, morris, and, his, followers, believed, the, division, of, labour, on, which, modern, industry, depended, was, undesirable, but, the, extent, to, which, every, design, should, be, carried, out, by, the, designer, was, a, matter, for, debate, and, disagreement, not, all, arts, and, crafts, artists, carried, out, every, stage, in, the, making, of, goods, themselves, and, it, was, only, in, the, twentieth, century, that, that, became, essential, to, the, definition, of, craftsmanship, although, morris, was, famous, for, getting, hands, on, experience, himself, of, many, crafts, including, weaving, dying, printing, calligraphy, and, embroidery, he, did, not, regard, the, separation, of, designer, and, executant, in, his, factory, as, problematic, walter, crane, a, close, political, associate, of, morris, s, took, an, unsympathetic, view, of, the, division, of, labour, on, both, moral, and, artistic, grounds, and, strongly, advocated, that, designing, and, making, should, come, from, the, same, hand, lewis, foreman, day, a, friend, and, contemporary, of, crane, s, as, unstinting, as, crane, in, his, admiration, of, morris, disagreed, strongly, with, crane, he, thought, that, the, separation, of, design, and, execution, was, not, only, inevitable, in, the, modern, world, but, also, that, only, that, sort, of, specialisation, allowed, the, best, in, design, and, the, best, in, making, few, of, the, founders, of, the, arts, and, crafts, exhibition, society, insisted, that, the, designer, should, also, be, the, maker, peter, floud, writing, in, the, 1950s, said, that, the, founders, of, the, society, never, executed, their, own, designs, but, invariably, turned, them, over, to, commercial, firms, the, idea, that, the, designer, should, be, the, maker, and, the, maker, the, designer, derived, not, from, morris, or, early, arts, and, crafts, teaching, but, rather, from, the, second, generation, elaboration, doctrine, worked, out, in, the, first, decade, of, century, by, men, such, as, w, r, lethaby, many, of, the, arts, and, crafts, movement, designers, were, socialists, including, morris, t, j, cobden, sanderson, walter, crane, c, r, ashbee, philip, webb, charles, faulkner, and, a, h, mackmurdo, in, the, early, 1880s, morris, was, spending, more, of, his, time, on, promoting, socialism, than, on, designing, and, making, ashbee, established, a, community, of, craftsmen, called, the, guild, of, handicraft, in, east, london, later, moving, to, chipping, campden, those, adherents, who, were, not, socialists, such, as, alfred, hoare, powell, advocated, a, more, humane, and, personal, relationship, between, employer, and, employee, lewis, foreman, day, was, another, successful, and, influential, arts, and, crafts, designer, who, was, not, a, socialist, despite, his, long, friendship, with, crane, in, britain, the, movement, was, associated, with, dress, reform, ruralism, the, garden, city, movement, and, the, folk, song, revival, all, were, linked, in, some, degree, by, the, ideal, of, the, simple, life, in, continental, europe, the, movement, was, associated, with, the, preservation, of, national, traditions, in, building, the, applied, arts, domestic, design, and, costume, morris, s, designs, quickly, became, popular, attracting, interest, when, his, company, s, work, was, exhibited, at, the, 1862, international, exhibition, in, london, much, of, this, work, is, directly, inspired, from, the, dictionnaire, of, viollet, le, duc, most, of, morris, co, s, early, work, was, for, churches, and, morris, won, important, interior, design, commissions, at, st, james, s, palace, and, the, south, kensington, museum, now, the, victoria, and, albert, museum, later, his, work, became, popular, with, the, middle, and, upper, classes, despite, his, wish, to, create, a, democratic, art, and, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, arts, and, crafts, design, in, houses, and, domestic, interiors, was, the, dominant, style, in, britain, copied, in, products, made, by, conventional, industrial, methods, the, spread, of, arts, and, crafts, ideas, during, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, resulted, in, the, establishment, of, many, associations, and, craft, communities, although, morris, had, little, to, do, with, them, because, of, his, preoccupation, with, socialism, at, the, time, a, hundred, and, thirty, arts, and, crafts, organisations, were, formed, in, britain, most, between, 1895, and, 1905, in, 1881, eglantyne, louisa, jebb, mary, fraser, tytler, and, others, initiated, the, home, arts, and, industries, association, to, encourage, the, working, classes, especially, those, in, rural, areas, to, take, up, handicrafts, under, supervision, not, for, profit, but, in, order, to, provide, them, with, useful, occupations, and, to, improve, their, taste, by, 1889, it, had, 450, classes, 1, 000, teachers, and, 5, 000, students, in, 1882, architect, a, h, mackmurdo, formed, the, century, guild, a, partnership, of, designers, including, selwyn, image, herbert, horne, clement, heaton, and, benjamin, creswick, in, 1884, the, art, workers, guild, was, initiated, by, five, young, architects, william, lethaby, edward, prior, ernest, newton, mervyn, macartney, and, gerald, c, horsley, with, the, goal, of, bringing, together, fine, and, applied, arts, and, raising, the, status, of, the, latter, it, was, directed, originally, by, george, blackall, simonds, by, 1890, the, guild, had, 150, members, representing, the, increasing, number, of, practitioners, of, the, arts, and, crafts, style, it, still, exists, the, london, department, store, liberty, co, founded, in, 1875, was, a, prominent, retailer, of, goods, in, the, style, and, of, the, artistic, dress, favoured, by, followers, of, the, arts, and, crafts, movement, in, 1887, the, arts, and, crafts, exhibition, society, which, gave, its, name, to, the, movement, was, formed, with, walter, crane, as, president, holding, its, first, exhibition, in, the, new, gallery, london, in, november, 1888, it, was, the, first, show, of, contemporary, decorative, arts, in, london, since, the, grosvenor, gallery, s, winter, exhibition, of, 1881, morris, co, was, well, represented, in, the, exhibition, with, furniture, fabrics, carpets, and, embroideries, edward, burne, jones, observed, here, for, the, first, time, one, can, measure, a, bit, the, change, that, has, happened, in, the, last, twenty, years, the, society, still, exists, as, the, society, of, designer, craftsmen, in, 1888, c, r, ashbee, a, major, late, practitioner, of, the, style, in, england, founded, the, guild, and, school, of, handicraft, in, the, east, end, of, london, the, guild, was, a, craft, co, operative, modelled, on, the, medieval, guilds, and, intended, to, give, working, men, satisfaction, in, their, craftsmanship, skilled, craftsmen, working, on, the, principles, of, ruskin, and, morris, were, to, produce, hand, crafted, goods, and, manage, a, school, for, apprentices, the, idea, was, greeted, with, enthusiasm, by, almost, everyone, except, morris, who, was, by, now, involved, with, promoting, socialism, and, thought, ashbee, s, scheme, trivial, from, 1888, to, 1902, the, guild, prospered, employing, about, 50, men, in, 1902, ashbee, relocated, the, guild, out, of, london, to, begin, an, experimental, community, in, chipping, campden, in, the, cotswolds, the, guild, s, work, is, characterised, by, plain, surfaces, of, hammered, silver, flowing, wirework, and, colored, stones, in, simple, settings, ashbee, designed, jewellery, and, silver, tableware, the, guild, flourished, at, chipping, camden, but, did, not, prosper, and, was, liquidated, in, 1908, some, craftsmen, stayed, contributing, to, the, tradition, of, modern, craftsmanship, in, the, area, c, f, a, voysey, 1857, 1941, was, an, arts, and, crafts, architect, who, also, designed, fabrics, tiles, ceramics, furniture, and, metalwork, his, style, combined, simplicity, with, sophistication, his, wallpapers, and, textiles, featuring, stylised, bird, and, plant, forms, in, bold, outlines, with, flat, colors, were, used, widely, morris, s, thought, influenced, the, distributism, of, g, k, chesterton, and, hilaire, belloc, by, the, end, of, the, nineteenth, century, arts, and, crafts, ideals, had, influenced, architecture, painting, sculpture, graphics, illustration, book, making, and, photography, domestic, design, and, the, decorative, arts, including, furniture, and, woodwork, stained, glass, leatherwork, lacemaking, embroidery, rug, making, and, weaving, jewelry, and, metalwork, enameling, and, ceramics, by, 1910, there, was, a, fashion, for, arts, and, crafts, and, all, things, hand, made, there, was, a, proliferation, of, amateur, handicrafts, of, variable, quality, and, of, incompetent, imitators, who, caused, the, public, to, regard, arts, and, crafts, as, something, less, instead, of, more, competent, and, fit, for, purpose, than, an, ordinary, mass, produced, article, the, arts, and, crafts, exhibition, society, held, eleven, exhibitions, between, 1888, and, 1916, by, the, outbreak, of, war, in, 1914, it, was, in, decline, and, faced, a, crisis, its, 1912, exhibition, had, been, a, financial, failure, while, designers, in, continental, europe, were, making, innovations, in, design, and, alliances, with, industry, through, initiatives, such, as, the, deutsche, werkbund, and, new, initiatives, were, being, taken, in, britain, by, the, omega, workshops, and, the, design, in, industries, association, the, arts, and, crafts, exhibition, society, now, under, the, control, of, an, old, guard, was, withdrawing, from, commerce, and, collaboration, with, manufacturers, into, purist, handwork, and, what, tania, harrod, describes, as, decommoditisation, its, rejection, of, a, commercial, role, has, been, seen, as, a, turning, point, in, its, fortunes, nikolaus, pevsner, in, his, book, pioneers, of, modern, design, presents, the, arts, and, crafts, movement, as, design, radicals, who, influenced, the, modern, movement, but, failed, to, change, and, were, eventually, superseded, by, it, the, british, artist, potter, bernard, leach, brought, to, england, many, ideas, he, had, developed, in, japan, with, the, social, critic, yanagi, soetsu, about, the, moral, and, social, value, of, simple, crafts, both, were, enthusiastic, readers, of, ruskin, leach, was, an, active, propagandist, for, these, ideas, which, struck, a, chord, with, practitioners, of, the, crafts, in, the, inter, war, years, and, he, expounded, them, in, a, potter, s,
