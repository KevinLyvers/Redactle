the, arnolfini, portrait, or, the, arnolfini, wedding, the, arnolfini, marriage, the, portrait, of, giovanni, arnolfini, and, his, wife, or, other, titles, is, an, oil, painting, on, oak, panel, by, the, early, netherlandish, painter, jan, van, eyck, dated, 1434, and, now, in, the, national, gallery, london, it, is, a, full, length, double, portrait, believed, to, depict, the, italian, merchant, giovanni, di, nicolao, arnolfini, and, his, wife, presumably, in, their, residence, at, the, flemish, city, of, bruges, it, is, considered, one, of, the, most, original, and, complex, paintings, in, western, art, because, of, its, beauty, complex, iconography, geometric, orthogonal, perspective, and, expansion, of, the, picture, space, with, the, use, of, a, mirror, according, to, ernst, gombrich, in, its, own, way, it, was, as, new, and, revolutionary, as, donatello, s, or, masaccio, s, work, in, italy, a, simple, corner, of, the, real, world, had, suddenly, been, fixed, on, to, a, panel, as, if, by, magic, for, the, first, time, in, history, the, artist, became, the, perfect, eye, witness, in, the, truest, sense, of, the, term, the, portrait, has, been, considered, by, erwin, panofsky, and, some, other, art, historians, as, a, unique, form, of, marriage, contract, recorded, as, a, painting, signed, and, dated, by, van, eyck, in, 1434, it, is, with, the, ghent, altarpiece, by, the, same, artist, and, his, brother, hubert, the, oldest, very, famous, panel, painting, to, have, been, executed, in, oils, rather, than, in, tempera, the, painting, was, bought, by, the, national, gallery, in, london, in, 1842, van, eyck, used, the, technique, of, applying, several, layers, of, thin, translucent, glazes, to, create, a, painting, with, an, intensity, of, both, tone, and, colour, the, glowing, colours, also, help, to, highlight, the, realism, and, to, show, the, material, wealth, and, opulence, of, arnolfini, s, world, van, eyck, took, advantage, of, the, longer, drying, time, of, oil, paint, compared, to, tempera, to, blend, colours, by, painting, wet, in, wet, to, achieve, subtle, variations, in, light, and, shade, to, heighten, the, illusion, of, three, dimensional, forms, the, wet, in, wet, wet, on, wet, technique, also, known, as, alla, prima, was, highly, utilized, by, renaissance, painters, including, jan, van, eyck, the, medium, of, oil, paint, also, permitted, van, eyck, to, capture, surface, appearance, and, distinguish, textures, precisely, he, also, rendered, the, effects, of, both, direct, and, diffuse, light, by, showing, the, light, from, the, window, on, the, left, reflected, by, various, surfaces, it, has, been, suggested, that, he, used, a, magnifying, glass, in, order, to, paint, the, minute, details, such, as, the, individual, highlights, on, each, of, the, amber, beads, hanging, beside, the, mirror, the, illusionism, of, the, painting, was, remarkable, for, its, time, in, part, for, the, rendering, of, detail, but, particularly, for, the, use, of, light, to, evoke, space, in, an, interior, for, its, utterly, convincing, depiction, of, a, room, as, well, of, the, people, who, inhabit, it, whatever, meaning, is, given, to, the, scene, and, its, details, and, there, has, been, much, debate, on, this, according, to, craig, harbison, the, painting, is, the, only, fifteenth, century, northern, panel, to, survive, in, which, the, artist, s, contemporaries, are, shown, engaged, in, some, sort, of, action, in, a, contemporary, interior, it, is, indeed, tempting, to, call, this, the, first, genre, painting, a, painting, of, everyday, life, of, modern, times, jan, van, eyck, s, characteristic, early, netherlandish, style, depicts, the, scene, with, a, high, level, of, detail, the, painting, is, generally, in, very, good, condition, though, with, small, losses, of, original, paint, and, damage, which, have, mostly, been, retouched, infrared, reflectograms, of, the, painting, show, many, small, alterations, or, pentimenti, in, the, underdrawing, to, both, faces, to, the, mirror, and, to, other, elements, the, couple, is, shown, in, an, upstairs, room, with, a, chest, and, a, bed, in, it, during, early, summer, as, indicated, by, the, fruits, on, the, cherry, tree, outside, the, window, the, room, probably, functioned, as, a, reception, room, as, it, was, the, fashion, in, france, and, burgundy, where, beds, in, reception, rooms, were, used, for, seating, except, for, example, when, a, mother, with, a, new, baby, received, visitors, the, window, has, six, interior, wooden, shutters, but, only, the, top, opening, has, glass, with, clear, bulls, eye, pieces, set, in, blue, red, and, green, stained, glass, the, two, figures, are, very, richly, dressed, despite, the, season, both, their, outer, garments, his, tabard, and, her, dress, are, trimmed, and, fully, lined, with, fur, the, furs, may, be, the, especially, expensive, sable, for, him, and, ermine, or, miniver, for, her, he, wears, a, hat, of, plaited, straw, dyed, black, as, often, worn, in, the, summer, at, the, time, his, tabard, was, more, purple, than, it, appears, now, as, the, pigments, have, faded, over, time, and, may, be, intended, to, be, silk, velvet, another, very, expensive, item, underneath, he, wears, a, doublet, of, patterned, material, probably, silk, damask, her, dress, has, elaborate, dagging, cloth, folded, and, sewn, together, then, cut, and, frayed, decoratively, on, the, sleeves, and, a, long, train, her, blue, underdress, is, also, trimmed, with, white, fur, although, the, woman, s, plain, gold, necklace, and, the, rings, that, both, wear, are, the, only, jewellery, visible, both, outfits, would, have, been, enormously, expensive, and, appreciated, as, such, by, a, contemporary, viewer, there, may, be, an, element, of, restraint, in, their, clothes, especially, the, man, befitting, their, merchant, status, portraits, of, aristocrats, tend, to, show, gold, chains, and, more, decorated, cloth, although, the, restrained, colours, of, the, man, s, clothing, correspond, to, those, favoured, by, duke, philip, of, burgundy, the, interior, of, the, room, has, other, signs, of, wealth, the, brass, chandelier, is, large, and, elaborate, by, contemporary, standards, and, would, have, been, very, expensive, it, would, probably, have, had, a, mechanism, with, pulley, and, chains, above, to, lower, it, for, managing, the, candles, possibly, omitted, from, the, painting, for, lack, of, room, the, convex, mirror, at, the, back, in, a, wooden, frame, with, scenes, of, the, passion, painted, behind, glass, is, shown, larger, than, such, mirrors, could, actually, be, made, at, this, date, another, discreet, departure, from, realism, by, van, eyck, there, is, also, no, sign, of, a, fireplace, including, in, the, mirror, nor, anywhere, obvious, to, put, one, even, the, oranges, casually, placed, to, the, left, are, a, sign, of, wealth, they, were, very, expensive, in, burgundy, and, may, have, been, one, of, the, items, dealt, in, by, arnolfini, further, signs, of, luxury, are, the, elaborate, bed, hangings, and, the, carvings, on, the, chair, and, bench, against, the, back, wall, to, the, right, partly, hidden, by, the, bed, also, the, small, oriental, carpet, on, the, floor, by, the, bed, many, owners, of, such, expensive, objects, placed, them, on, tables, as, they, still, do, in, the, netherlands, there, existed, a, friendship, between, giovanni, arnolfini, and, philip, the, good, who, sent, his, court, painter, jan, van, eyck, to, portray, arnolfini, double, the, relation, possibly, began, with, a, tapestry, order, including, the, images, of, notre, dame, cathedral, in, return, of, a, good, payment, the, view, in, the, mirror, shows, two, figures, just, inside, the, door, that, the, couple, are, facing, the, second, figure, wearing, red, is, presumably, the, artist, although, unlike, vel, zquez, in, las, meninas, he, does, not, seem, to, be, painting, scholars, have, made, this, assumption, based, on, the, appearance, of, figures, wearing, red, head, dresses, in, some, other, van, eyck, works, e, g, the, portrait, of, a, man, self, portrait, and, the, figure, in, the, background, of, the, madonna, with, chancellor, rolin, a, dog, is, an, early, form, of, the, breed, now, known, as, the, affenpinscher, the, painting, is, signed, inscribed, and, dated, on, the, wall, above, the, mirror, johannes, de, eyck, fuit, hic, 1434, jan, van, eyck, was, here, 1434, the, inscription, looks, as, if, it, were, painted, in, large, letters, on, the, wall, as, was, done, with, proverbs, and, other, phrases, at, this, period, other, surviving, van, eyck, signatures, are, painted, in, trompe, l, il, on, the, wooden, frame, of, his, paintings, so, that, they, appear, to, have, been, carved, in, the, wood, in, their, book, published, in, 1857, crowe, and, cavalcaselle, were, the, first, to, link, the, double, portrait, with, the, early, 16th, century, inventories, of, margaret, of, austria, they, suggested, that, the, painting, showed, portraits, of, giovanni, arnolfini, and, his, wife, four, years, later, james, weale, published, a, book, in, which, he, agreed, with, this, analysis, and, identified, giovanni, s, wife, as, jeanne, or, giovanna, cenami, for, the, next, century, most, art, historians, accepted, that, the, painting, was, a, double, portrait, of, giovanni, di, arrigo, arnolfini, and, his, wife, jeanne, cenami, but, a, chance, discovery, published, in, 1997, established, that, they, were, married, in, 1447, thirteen, years, after, the, date, on, the, painting, and, six, years, after, van, eyck, s, death, it, is, now, believed, that, the, subject, is, either, giovanni, di, arrigo, or, his, cousin, giovanni, di, nicolao, arnolfini, and, a, wife, of, either, one, of, them, this, is, either, an, undocumented, first, wife, of, giovanni, di, arrigo, or, a, second, wife, of, giovanni, di, nicolao, or, according, to, a, recent, proposal, giovanni, di, nicolao, s, first, wife, costanza, trenta, who, had, died, perhaps, in, childbirth, by, february, 1433, in, the, latter, case, this, would, make, the, painting, partly, an, unusual, memorial, portrait, showing, one, living, and, one, dead, person, details, such, as, the, snuffed, candle, above, the, woman, the, scenes, after, christ, s, death, on, her, side, of, the, background, roundel, and, the, black, garb, of, the, man, support, this, view, both, giovanni, di, arrigo, and, giovanni, di, nicolao, arnolfini, were, italian, merchants, originally, from, lucca, but, resident, in, bruges, since, at, least, 1419, the, man, in, this, painting, is, the, subject, of, a, further, portrait, by, van, eyck, in, the, gem, ldegalerie, berlin, leading, to, speculation, he, was, a, friend, of, the, artist, in, 1934, erwin, panofsky, published, an, article, entitled, jan, van, eyck, s, arnolfini, portrait, in, the, burlington, magazine, arguing, that, the, elaborate, signature, on, the, back, wall, and, other, factors, showed, that, it, was, painted, as, a, legal, record, of, the, occasion, of, the, marriage, of, the, couple, complete, with, witnesses, and, a, witness, signature, panofsky, also, argues, that, the, many, details, of, domestic, items, in, the, painting, each, have, a, disguised, symbolism, attached, to, their, appearance, while, panofsky, s, claim, that, the, painting, formed, a, kind, of, certificate, of, marriage, is, not, accepted, by, all, art, historians, his, analysis, of, the, symbolic, function, of, the, details, is, broadly, agreed, and, has, been, applied, to, many, other, early, netherlandish, paintings, especially, a, number, of, depictions, of, the, annunciation, set, in, richly, detailed, interiors, a, tradition, for, which, the, arnolfini, portrait, and, the, m, rode, altarpiece, by, robert, campin, represent, the, start, in, terms, of, surviving, works, at, least, since, then, there, has, been, considerable, scholarly, argument, among, art, historians, on, the, occasion, represented, edwin, hall, considers, that, the, painting, depicts, a, betrothal, not, a, marriage, margaret, d, carroll, argues, that, the, painting, is, a, portrait, of, a, married, couple, that, alludes, also, to, the, husband, s, grant, of, legal, authority, to, his, wife, carroll, also, proposes, that, the, portrait, was, meant, to, affirm, giovanni, arnolfini, s, good, character, as, a, merchant, and, aspiring, member, of, the, burgundian, court, she, argues, that, the, painting, depicts, a, couple, already, married, now, formalizing, a, subsequent, legal, arrangement, a, mandate, by, which, the, husband, hands, over, to, his, wife, the, legal, authority, to, conduct, business, on, her, own, or, his, behalf, similar, to, a, power, of, attorney, the, claim, is, not, that, the, painting, had, any, legal, force, but, that, van, eyck, played, upon, the, imagery, of, legal, contract, as, a, pictorial, conceit, while, the, two, figures, in, the, mirror, could, be, thought, of, as, witnesses, to, the, oath, taking, the, artist, himself, provides, witty, authentication, with, his, notarial, signature, on, the, wall, jan, baptist, bedaux, agrees, somewhat, with, panofsky, that, this, is, a, marriage, contract, portrait, in, his, 1986, article, the, reality, of, symbols, the, question, of, disguised, symbolism, in, jan, van, eyck, s, arnolfini, portrait, however, he, disagrees, with, panofsky, s, idea, of, items, in, the, portrait, having, hidden, meanings, bedaux, argues, if, the, symbols, are, disguised, to, such, an, extent, that, they, do, not, clash, with, reality, as, conceived, at, the, time, there, will, be, no, means, of, proving, that, the, painter, actually, intended, such, symbolism, he, also, conjectures, that, if, these, disguised, symbols, were, normal, parts, of, the, marriage, ritual, then, one, could, not, say, for, sure, whether, the, items, were, part, of, a, disguised, symbolism, or, just, social, reality, craig, harbison, takes, the, middle, ground, between, panofsky, and, bedaux, in, their, debate, about, disguised, symbolism, and, realism, harbison, argues, that, jan, van, eyck, is, there, as, storyteller, must, have, been, able, to, understand, that, within, the, context, of, people, s, lives, objects, could, have, multiple, associations, and, that, there, are, many, possible, purposes, for, the, portrait, and, ways, it, can, be, interpreted, he, maintains, that, this, portrait, cannot, be, fully, interpreted, until, scholars, accept, the, notion, that, objects, can, have, multiple, associations, harbison, urges, the, notion, that, one, needs, to, conduct, a, multivalent, reading, of, the, painting, that, includes, references, to, the, secular, and, sexual, context, of, the, burgundian, court, as, well, as, religious, and, sacramental, references, to, marriage, lorne, campbell, in, the, national, gallery, catalogue, sees, no, need, to, find, a, special, meaning, in, the, painting, there, seems, little, reason, to, believe, that, the, portrait, has, any, significant, narrative, content, only, the, unnecessary, lighted, candle, and, the, strange, signature, provoke, speculation, he, suggests, that, the, double, portrait, was, very, possibly, made, to, commemorate, a, marriage, but, not, a, legal, record, and, cites, examples, of, miniatures, from, manuscripts, showing, similarly, elaborate, inscriptions, on, walls, as, a, normal, form, of, decoration, at, the, time, another, portrait, in, the, national, gallery, by, van, eyck, portrait, of, a, man, leal, souvenir, has, a, legalistic, form, of, signature, margaret, koster, s, new, suggestion, discussed, above, and, below, that, the, portrait, is, a, memorial, one, of, a, wife, already, dead, for, a, year, or, so, would, displace, these, theories, art, historian, maximiliaan, martens, has, suggested, that, the, painting, was, meant, as, a, gift, for, the, arnolfini, family, in, italy, it, had, the, purpose, of, showing, the, prosperity, and, wealth, of, the, couple, depicted, he, feels, this, might, explain, oddities, in, the, painting, for, example, why, the, couple, are, standing, in, typical, winter, clothing, while, a, cherry, tree, is, in, fruit, outside, and, why, the, phrase, johannes, de, eyck, fuit, hic, 1434, is, featured, so, large, in, the, centre, of, the, painting, herman, colenbrander, has, proposed, that, the, painting, may, depict, an, old, german, custom, of, a, husband, promising, a, gift, to, his, bride, on, the, morning, after, their, wedding, night, he, has, also, suggested, that, the, painting, may, have, been, a, present, from, the, artist, to, his, friend, in, 2016, french, physician, jean, philippe, postel, in, his, book, l, affaire, arnolfini, agreed, with, koster, that, the, woman, is, dead, but, he, suggested, that, she, is, appearing, to, the, man, as, a, spectre, asking, him, to, pray, for, her, soul, it, is, thought, that, the, couple, are, already, married, because, of, the, woman, s, headdress, a, non, married, woman, would, have, her, hair, down, according, to, margaret, carroll, the, placement, of, the, two, figures, suggests, conventional, 15th, century, views, of, marriage, and, gender, roles, the, woman, stands, near, the, bed, and, well, into, the, room, symbolic, of, her, role, as, the, caretaker, of, the, house, and, solidifying, her, in, a, domestic, role, whereas, giovanni, stands, near, the, open, window, symbolic, of, his, role, in, the, outside, world, arnolfini, looks, directly, out, at, the, viewer, his, wife, gazes, obediently, at, her, husband, his, hand, is, vertically, raised, representing, his, commanding, position, of, authority, whilst, she, has, her, hand, in, a, lower, horizontal, more, submissive, pose, however, her, gaze, at, her, husband, can, also, show, her, equality, to, him, because, she, is, not, looking, down, at, the, floor, as, lower, class, women, would, they, are, part, of, the, burgundian, court, life, and, in, that, system, she, is, his, equal, not, his, lowly, subordinate, the, symbolism, behind, the, action, of, the, couple, s, joined, hands, has, also, been, debated, among, scholars, many, point, to, this, gesture, as, proof, of, the, painting, s, purpose, is, it, a, marriage, contract, or, something, else, panofsky, interprets, the, gesture, as, an, act, of, fides, latin, for, marital, oath, he, calls, the, representation, of, the, couple, qui, desponsari, videbantur, per, fidem, which, means, who, were, contracting, their, marriage, by, marital, oath, the, man, is, grasping, the, woman, s, right, hand, with, his, left, which, is, the, basis, for, the, controversy, some, scholars, like, jan, baptist, bedaux, and, peter, schabacker, argue, that, if, this, painting, does, show, a, marriage, ceremony, then, the, use, of, the, left, hand, points, to, the, marriage, being, morganatic, and, not, clandestine, a, marriage, is, said, to, be, morganatic, if, a, man, marries, a, woman, of, unequal, rank, however, the, subjects, originally, thought, by, most, scholars, to, be, represented, in, this, painting, giovanni, arnolfini, and, giovanna, cenami, were, of, equal, status, and, rank, in, the, courtly, system, so, the, theory, would, not, hold, true, on, the, opposite, side, of, the, debate, are, scholars, like, margaret, carroll, she, suggests, that, the, painting, deploys, the, imagery, of, a, contract, between, an, already, married, couple, giving, the, wife, the, authority, to, act, on, her, husband, s, behalf, in, business, dealings, carroll, identifies, arnolfini, s, raised, right, hand, as, a, gesture, of, oath, taking, known, as, fidem, levare, and, his, joining, hands, with, his, wife, as, a, gesture, of, consent, known, as, fides, manualis, although, many, viewers, assume, the, wife, to, be, pregnant, this, is, not, believed, to, be, so, art, historians, point, to, numerous, paintings, of, female, virgin, saints, similarly, dressed, and, believe, that, this, look, was, fashionable, for, women, s, dresses, at, the, time, fashion, would, have, been, important, to, arnolfini, especially, since, he, was, a, cloth, merchant, the, more, cloth, a, person, wore, the, more, wealthy, he, or, she, was, assumed, to, be, another, indication, that, the, woman, is, not, pregnant, is, that, giovanna, cenami, the, identification, of, the, woman, according, to, most, earlier, scholars, died, childless, as, did, costanza, trenta, a, possible, identification, according, to, recent, archival, evidence, whether, a, hypothetical, unsuccessful, pregnancy, would, have, been, left, recorded, in, a, portrait, is, questionable, although, if, it, is, indeed, costanza, trenta, as, koster, proposed, and, she, died, in, childbirth, then, the, oblique, reference, to, pregnancy, gains, strength, moreover, the, beauty, ideal, embodied, in, contemporary, female, portraits, and, clothing, rest, in, the, first, place, on, the, high, valuation, on, the, ability, of, women, to, bear, children, harbison, maintains, her, gesture, is, merely, an, indication, of, the, extreme, desire, of, the, couple, shown, for, fertility, and, progeny, there, is, a, carved, figure, as, a, finial, on, the, bedpost, probably, of, saint, margaret, patron, saint, of, pregnancy, and, childbirth, who, was, invoked, to, assist, women, in, labor, and, to, cure, infertility, or, possibly, representing, saint, martha, the, patroness, of, housewives, from, the, bedpost, hangs, a, brush, symbolic, of, domestic, duties, furthermore, the, brush, and, the, rock, crystal, prayer, beads, a, popular, engagement, present, from, the, future, bridegroom, appearing, together, on, either, side, of, the, mirror, may, also, allude, to, the, dual, christian, injunctions, ora, et, labora, pray, and, work, according, to, jan, baptist, bedaux, the, broom, could, also, symbolize, proverbial, chastity, it, sweeps, out, impurities, the, small, medallions, set, into, the, frame, of, the, convex, mirror, at, the, back, of, the, room, show, tiny, scenes, from, the, passion, of, christ, and, may, represent, god, s, promise, of, salvation, for, the, figures, reflected, on, the, mirror, s, convex, surface, furthering, the, memorial, theory, all, the, scenes, on, the, wife, s, side, are, of, christ, s, death, and, resurrection, those, on, the, husband, s, side, concern, christ, s, life, the, mirror, itself, may, represent, the, eye, of, god, observing, the, vows, of, the, wedding, a, spotless, mirror, was, also, an, established, symbol, of, mary, referring, to, the, holy, virgin, s, immaculate, conception, and, purity, the, mirror, reflects, two, figures, in, the, doorway, one, of, whom, may, be, the, painter, himself, in, panofsky, s, controversial, view, the, figures, are, shown, to, prove, that, the, two, witnesses, required, to, make, a, wedding, legal, were, present, and, van, eyck, s, signature, on, the, wall, acts, as, some, form, of, actual, documentation, of, an, event, at, which, he, was, himself, present, according, to, one, author, the, painting, is, often, referenced, for, its, immaculate, depiction, of, non, euclidean, geometry, referring, to, the, image, on, the, convex, mirror, assuming, a, spherical, mirror, the, distortion, has, been, correctly, portrayed, except, for, the, leftmost, part, of, the, window, frame, the, near, edge, of, the, table, and, the, hem, of, the, dress, the, little, dog, may, symbolize, fidelity, fido, loyalty, or, alternatively, lust, signifying, the, couple, s, desire, to, have, a, child, unlike, the, couple, he, looks, out, to, meet, the, gaze, of, the, viewer, the, dog, could, be, simply, a, lap, dog, a, gift, from, husband, to, wife, many, wealthy, women, in, the, court, had, lap, dogs, as, companions, reflecting, the, wealth, of, the, couple, and, their, position, in, courtly, life, the, dog, appears, to, be, a, griffon, terrier, or, perhaps, an, affenpinscher, the, green, of, the, woman, s, dress, symbolizes, hope, possibly, the, hope, of, becoming, a, mother, its, intense, brightness, also, indicates, wealth, since, dyeing, fabric, such, a, shade, was, difficult, and, expensive, her, white, cap, could, signify, purity, or, her, status, as, married, behind, the, pair, the, curtains, of, the, marriage, bed, have, been, opened, the, red, curtains, might, allude, to, the, physical, act, of, love, the, single, candle, in, the, left, front, holder, of, the, ornate, six, branched, chandelier, is, possibly, the, candle, used, in, traditional, flemish, marriage, customs, lit, in, full, daylight, like, the, sanctuary, lamp, in, a, church, the, candle, may, allude, to, the, presence, of, the, holy, ghost, or, the, ever, present, eye, of, god, alternatively, margaret, koster, posits, that, the, painting, is, a, memorial, portrait, as, the, single, lit, candle, on, giovanni, s, side, contrasts, with, the, burnt, out, candle, whose, wax, stub, can, just, be, seen, on, his, wife, s, side, in, a, visual, play,
