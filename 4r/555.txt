wood, carving, is, a, form, of, woodworking, by, means, of, a, cutting, tool, knife, in, one, hand, or, a, chisel, by, two, hands, or, with, one, hand, on, a, chisel, and, one, hand, on, a, mallet, resulting, in, a, wooden, figure, or, figurine, or, in, the, sculptural, ornamentation, of, a, wooden, object, the, phrase, may, also, refer, to, the, finished, product, from, individual, sculptures, to, hand, worked, mouldings, composing, part, of, a, tracery, the, making, of, sculpture, in, wood, has, been, extremely, widely, practised, but, does, not, survive, undamaged, as, well, as, the, other, main, materials, like, stone, and, bronze, as, it, is, vulnerable, to, decay, insect, damage, and, fire, therefore, it, forms, an, important, hidden, element, in, the, art, history, of, many, cultures, outdoor, wood, sculptures, do, not, last, long, in, most, parts, of, the, world, so, it, is, still, unknown, how, the, totem, pole, tradition, developed, many, of, the, most, important, sculptures, of, china, and, japan, in, particular, are, in, wood, and, so, are, the, great, majority, of, african, sculpture, and, that, of, oceania, and, other, regions, wood, is, light, and, can, take, very, fine, detail, so, it, is, highly, suitable, for, masks, and, other, sculpture, intended, to, be, worn, or, carried, it, is, also, much, easier, to, work, on, than, stone, and, can, be, carved, more, thinly, and, precisely, due, to, its, fibrous, strength, some, of, the, finest, extant, examples, of, early, european, wood, carving, are, from, the, middle, ages, in, germany, russia, italy, and, france, where, the, typical, themes, of, that, era, were, christian, iconography, in, england, many, complete, examples, remain, from, the, 16th, and, 17th, century, where, oak, was, the, preferred, medium, the, oldest, wood, carved, sculpture, the, shigir, idol, carved, from, larch, is, around, 12, 000, years, old, pattern, blocking, detailing, surfacing, and, smoothening, the, nature, of, the, wood, being, carved, limits, the, scope, of, the, carver, in, that, wood, is, not, equally, strong, in, all, directions, it, is, an, anisotropic, material, the, direction, in, which, wood, is, strongest, is, called, grain, grain, may, be, straight, interlocked, wavy, or, fiddleback, etc, it, is, smart, to, arrange, the, more, delicate, parts, of, a, design, along, the, grain, instead, of, across, it, often, however, a, line, of, best, fit, is, instead, employed, since, a, design, may, have, multiple, weak, points, in, different, directions, or, orientation, of, these, along, the, grain, would, necessitate, carving, detail, on, end, grain, which, is, considerably, more, difficult, carving, blanks, are, also, sometimes, assembled, as, with, carousel, horses, out, of, many, smaller, boards, and, in, this, way, one, can, orient, different, areas, of, a, carving, in, the, most, logical, way, both, for, the, carving, process, and, for, durability, less, commonly, this, same, principle, is, used, in, solid, pieces, of, wood, where, the, fork, of, two, branches, is, utilized, for, its, divergent, grain, or, a, branch, off, of, a, larger, log, is, carved, into, a, beak, this, was, the, technique, employed, for, traditional, welsh, shepherd, s, crooks, and, some, native, american, adze, handles, the, failure, to, appreciate, these, primary, rules, may, constantly, be, seen, in, damaged, work, when, it, will, be, noticed, that, whereas, tendrils, tips, of, birds, beaks, etc, arranged, across, the, grain, have, been, broken, away, similar, details, designed, more, in, harmony, with, the, growth, of, the, wood, and, not, too, deeply, undercut, remain, intact, probably, the, two, most, common, woods, used, for, carving, in, north, america, are, basswood, aka, tilia, or, lime, and, tupelo, both, are, hardwoods, that, are, relatively, easy, to, work, with, chestnut, butternut, oak, american, walnut, mahogany, and, teak, are, also, very, good, woods, while, for, fine, work, italian, walnut, sycamore, maple, apple, pear, box, or, plum, are, usually, chosen, decoration, that, is, to, be, painted, and, of, not, too, delicate, a, nature, is, often, carved, in, pine, which, is, relatively, soft, and, inexpensive, a, wood, carver, begins, a, new, carving, by, selecting, a, chunk, of, wood, the, approximate, size, and, shape, of, the, figure, he, or, she, wishes, to, create, or, if, the, carving, is, to, be, large, several, pieces, of, wood, may, be, laminated, together, to, create, the, required, size, the, type, of, wood, is, important, hardwoods, are, more, difficult, to, shape, but, have, greater, luster, and, longevity, softer, woods, may, be, easier, to, carve, but, are, more, prone, to, damage, any, wood, can, be, carved, but, they, all, have, different, qualities, and, characteristics, the, choice, will, depend, on, the, requirements, of, carving, being, done, for, example, a, detailed, figure, would, need, a, wood, with, a, fine, grain, and, very, little, figure, as, a, strong, figure, can, interfere, with, reading, fine, detail, once, the, sculptor, has, selected, their, wood, he, or, she, begins, a, general, shaping, process, using, gouges, of, various, sizes, the, gouge, is, a, curved, blade, that, can, remove, large, portions, of, wood, smoothly, for, harder, woods, the, sculptor, may, use, gouges, sharpened, with, stronger, bevels, about, 35, degrees, and, a, mallet, similar, to, a, stone, carver, s, the, terms, gouge, and, chisel, are, open, to, confusion, correctly, a, gouge, is, a, tool, with, a, curved, cross, section, and, a, chisel, is, a, tool, with, a, flat, cross, section, however, professional, carvers, tend, to, refer, to, them, all, as, chisels, smaller, sculptures, may, require, the, woodcarver, to, use, a, knife, and, larger, pieces, might, require, the, use, of, a, saw, no, matter, what, wood, is, selected, or, tool, used, the, wood, sculptor, must, always, carve, either, across, or, with, the, grain, of, the, wood, never, against, the, grain, once, the, general, shape, is, made, the, carver, may, use, a, variety, of, tools, for, creating, details, for, example, a, veiner, or, fluter, can, be, used, to, make, deep, gouges, into, the, surface, or, a, v, tool, for, making, fine, lines, or, decorative, cuts, once, the, finer, details, have, been, added, the, woodcarver, finishes, the, surface, the, method, chosen, depends, on, the, required, quality, of, the, surface, finish, the, texture, left, by, shallow, gouges, gives, life, to, the, carving, s, surface, and, many, carvers, prefer, this, tooled, finish, if, a, completely, smooth, surface, is, required, general, smoothing, can, be, done, with, tools, such, as, rasps, which, are, flat, bladed, tools, with, a, surface, of, pointed, teeth, rifflers, are, similar, to, rasps, but, smaller, usually, double, ended, and, of, various, shapes, for, working, in, folds, or, crevasses, the, finer, polishing, is, done, with, abrasive, paper, large, grained, paper, with, a, rougher, surface, is, used, first, with, the, sculptor, then, using, finer, grained, paper, that, can, make, the, surface, of, the, sculpture, slick, to, the, touch, after, the, carving, and, finishing, is, completed, the, artist, may, seal, colour, the, wood, with, a, variety, of, natural, oils, such, as, walnut, or, linseed, oil, which, protects, the, wood, from, dirt, and, moisture, oil, also, imparts, a, sheen, to, the, wood, which, by, reflecting, light, helps, the, observer, read, the, form, carvers, seldom, use, gloss, varnish, as, it, creates, too, shiny, a, surface, which, reflects, so, much, light, it, can, confuse, the, form, carvers, refer, to, this, as, the, toffee, apple, effect, objects, made, of, wood, are, frequently, finished, with, a, layer, of, wax, which, protects, the, wood, and, gives, a, soft, lustrous, sheen, a, wax, finish, e, g, shoe, polish, is, comparatively, fragile, though, and, only, suitable, for, indoor, carvings
