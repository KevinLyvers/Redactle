stonehenge, is, a, prehistoric, megalithic, structure, on, salisbury, plain, in, wiltshire, england, two, miles, 3, km, west, of, amesbury, it, consists, of, an, outer, ring, of, vertical, sarsen, standing, stones, each, around, 13, feet, 4, 0, m, high, seven, feet, 2, 1, m, wide, and, weighing, around, 25, tons, topped, by, connecting, horizontal, lintel, stones, held, in, place, with, mortise, and, tenon, joints, a, feature, unique, among, contemporary, monuments, inside, is, a, ring, of, smaller, bluestones, inside, these, are, free, standing, trilithons, two, bulkier, vertical, sarsens, joined, by, one, lintel, the, whole, monument, now, ruinous, is, aligned, towards, the, sunrise, on, the, summer, solstice, and, sunset, on, the, winter, solstice, the, stones, are, set, within, earthworks, in, the, middle, of, the, densest, complex, of, neolithic, and, bronze, age, monuments, in, england, including, several, hundred, tumuli, burial, mounds, stonehenge, was, constructed, in, several, phases, beginning, about, 3100, bc, and, continuing, until, about, 1600, bc, the, famous, circle, of, large, sarsen, stones, were, placed, between, 2600, bc, and, 2400, bc, the, surrounding, circular, earth, bank, and, ditch, which, constitute, the, earliest, phase, of, the, monument, have, been, dated, to, about, 3100, bc, radiocarbon, dating, suggests, that, the, bluestones, were, given, their, current, positions, between, 2400, and, 2200, bc, although, they, may, have, been, at, the, site, as, early, as, 3000, bc, one, of, the, most, famous, landmarks, in, the, united, kingdom, stonehenge, is, regarded, as, a, british, cultural, icon, it, has, been, a, legally, protected, scheduled, monument, since, 1882, when, the, ancient, monuments, protection, act, was, passed, in, the, uk, the, site, and, its, surroundings, were, added, to, unesco, s, list, of, world, heritage, sites, in, 1986, stonehenge, is, owned, by, the, crown, and, managed, by, english, heritage, the, surrounding, land, is, owned, by, the, national, trust, stonehenge, could, have, been, a, burial, ground, from, its, earliest, beginnings, deposits, containing, human, bone, date, from, as, early, as, 3000, bc, when, the, ditch, and, bank, were, first, dug, and, continued, for, at, least, another, 500, years, the, oxford, english, dictionary, cites, lfric, s, 10th, century, glossary, in, which, henge, cliff, is, given, the, meaning, precipice, or, stone, thus, the, stanenges, or, stanheng, not, far, from, salisbury, recorded, by, 11th, century, writers, are, stones, supported, in, the, air, in, 1740, william, stukeley, notes, pendulous, rocks, are, now, called, henges, in, yorkshire, i, doubt, not, stonehenge, in, saxon, signifies, the, hanging, stones, christopher, chippindale, s, stonehenge, complete, gives, the, derivation, of, the, name, stonehenge, as, coming, from, the, old, english, words, st, n, stone, and, either, hencg, hinge, because, the, stone, lintels, hinge, on, the, upright, stones, or, hen, c, en, to, hang, or, gallows, or, instrument, of, torture, though, elsewhere, in, his, book, chippindale, cites, the, suspended, stones, etymology, the, henge, portion, has, given, its, name, to, a, class, of, monuments, known, as, henges, archaeologists, define, henges, as, earthworks, consisting, of, a, circular, banked, enclosure, with, an, internal, ditch, as, often, happens, in, archaeological, terminology, this, is, a, holdover, from, antiquarian, use, mike, parker, pearson, leader, of, the, stonehenge, riverside, project, based, around, durrington, walls, noted, that, stonehenge, appears, to, have, been, associated, with, burial, from, the, earliest, period, of, its, existence, stonehenge, was, a, place, of, burial, from, its, beginning, to, its, zenith, in, the, mid, third, millennium, b, c, the, cremation, burial, dating, to, stonehenge, s, sarsen, stones, phase, is, likely, just, one, of, many, from, this, later, period, of, the, monument, s, use, and, demonstrates, that, it, was, still, very, much, a, domain, of, the, dead, stonehenge, evolved, in, several, construction, phases, spanning, at, least, 1500, years, there, is, evidence, of, large, scale, construction, on, and, around, the, monument, that, perhaps, extends, the, landscape, s, time, frame, to, 6500, years, dating, and, understanding, the, various, phases, of, activity, are, complicated, by, disturbance, of, the, natural, chalk, by, periglacial, effects, and, animal, burrowing, poor, quality, early, excavation, records, and, a, lack, of, accurate, scientifically, verified, dates, the, modern, phasing, most, generally, agreed, to, by, archaeologists, is, detailed, below, features, mentioned, in, the, text, are, numbered, and, shown, on, the, plan, right, archaeologists, have, found, four, or, possibly, five, large, mesolithic, postholes, one, may, have, been, a, natural, tree, throw, which, date, to, around, 8000, bc, beneath, the, nearby, old, tourist, car, park, in, use, until, 2013, these, held, pine, posts, around, two, feet, six, inches, 0, 75, m, in, diameter, which, were, erected, and, eventually, rotted, in, place, three, of, the, posts, and, possibly, four, were, in, an, east, west, alignment, which, may, have, had, ritual, significance, another, mesolithic, astronomical, site, in, britain, is, warren, field, in, aberdeenshire, which, is, considered, the, world, s, oldest, lunisolar, calendar, corrected, yearly, by, observing, the, midwinter, solstice, similar, but, later, sites, have, been, found, in, scandinavia, a, settlement, that, may, have, been, contemporaneous, with, the, posts, has, been, found, at, blick, mead, a, reliable, year, round, spring, one, mile, 1, 6, km, from, stonehenge, salisbury, plain, was, then, still, wooded, but, 4, 000, years, later, during, the, earlier, neolithic, people, built, a, causewayed, enclosure, at, robin, hood, s, ball, and, long, barrow, tombs, in, the, surrounding, landscape, in, approximately, 3500, bc, a, stonehenge, cursus, was, built, 2, 300, feet, 700, m, north, of, the, site, as, the, first, farmers, began, to, clear, the, trees, and, develop, the, area, other, previously, overlooked, stone, or, wooden, structures, and, burial, mounds, may, date, as, far, back, as, 4000, bc, charcoal, from, the, blick, mead, camp, 1, 5, miles, 2, 4, km, from, stonehenge, near, the, vespasian, s, camp, site, has, been, dated, to, 4000, bc, the, university, of, buckingham, s, humanities, research, institute, believes, that, the, community, who, built, stonehenge, lived, here, for, several, millennia, making, it, potentially, one, of, the, pivotal, places, in, the, history, of, the, stonehenge, landscape, the, first, monument, consisted, of, a, circular, bank, and, ditch, enclosure, made, of, late, cretaceous, santonian, age, seaford, chalk, measuring, about, 360, feet, 110, m, in, diameter, with, a, large, entrance, to, the, north, east, and, a, smaller, one, to, the, south, it, stood, in, open, grassland, on, a, slightly, sloping, spot, the, builders, placed, the, bones, of, deer, and, oxen, in, the, bottom, of, the, ditch, as, well, as, some, worked, flint, tools, the, bones, were, considerably, older, than, the, antler, picks, used, to, dig, the, ditch, and, the, people, who, buried, them, had, looked, after, them, for, some, time, prior, to, burial, the, ditch, was, continuous, but, had, been, dug, in, sections, like, the, ditches, of, the, earlier, causewayed, enclosures, in, the, area, the, chalk, dug, from, the, ditch, was, piled, up, to, form, the, bank, this, first, stage, is, dated, to, around, 3100, bc, after, which, the, ditch, began, to, silt, up, naturally, within, the, outer, edge, of, the, enclosed, area, is, a, circle, of, 56, pits, each, about, 3, 3, feet, 1, m, in, diameter, known, as, the, aubrey, holes, after, john, aubrey, the, 17th, century, antiquarian, who, was, thought, to, have, first, identified, them, these, pits, and, the, bank, and, ditch, together, are, known, as, the, palisade, or, gate, ditch, the, pits, may, have, contained, standing, timbers, creating, a, timber, circle, although, there, is, no, excavated, evidence, of, them, a, recent, excavation, has, suggested, that, the, aubrey, holes, may, have, originally, been, used, to, erect, a, bluestone, circle, if, this, were, the, case, it, would, advance, the, earliest, known, stone, structure, at, the, monument, by, some, 500, years, in, 2013, a, team, of, archaeologists, led, by, mike, parker, pearson, excavated, more, than, 50, 000, cremated, bone, fragments, from, 63, individuals, buried, at, stonehenge, these, remains, were, originally, buried, individually, in, the, aubrey, holes, but, were, exhumed, in, 1920, during, an, excavation, by, william, hawley, who, considered, them, unimportant, and, in, 1935, re, buried, them, together, in, one, hole, aubrey, hole, 7, physical, and, chemical, analysis, of, the, remains, has, shown, that, the, cremated, were, almost, equally, men, and, women, and, included, some, children, there, is, evidence, that, the, underlying, chalk, beneath, the, graves, was, crushed, by, substantial, weight, so, the, team, concluded, that, the, first, bluestones, brought, from, wales, were, probably, used, as, grave, markers, radiocarbon, dating, of, the, remains, has, put, the, date, of, the, site, 500, years, earlier, than, previously, estimated, to, around, 3000, bc, a, 2018, study, of, the, strontium, content, of, the, bones, found, that, many, of, the, individuals, buried, there, around, the, time, of, construction, had, probably, come, from, near, the, source, of, the, bluestone, in, wales, and, had, not, extensively, lived, in, the, area, of, stonehenge, before, death, between, 2017, and, 2021, studies, by, professor, parker, pearson, ucl, and, his, team, suggested, that, the, bluestones, used, in, stonehenge, had, been, moved, there, following, dismantling, of, a, stone, circle, of, identical, size, to, the, first, known, stonehenge, circle, 110m, at, the, welsh, site, of, waun, mawn, in, the, preseli, hills, it, had, contained, bluestones, one, of, which, showed, evidence, of, having, been, reused, in, stonehenge, the, stone, was, identified, by, its, unusual, pentagonal, shape, and, by, luminescence, soil, dating, from, the, filled, in, sockets, which, showed, the, circle, had, been, erected, around, 3400, 3200, bc, and, dismantled, around, 300, 400, years, later, consistent, with, the, dates, attributed, to, the, creation, of, stonehenge, the, cessation, of, human, activity, in, that, area, at, the, same, time, suggested, migration, as, a, reason, but, it, is, believed, that, other, stones, may, have, come, from, other, sources, the, second, phase, of, construction, occurred, approximately, between, 2900, and, 2600, bc, the, number, of, postholes, dating, to, the, early, third, millennium, bc, suggests, that, some, form, of, timber, structure, was, built, within, the, enclosure, during, this, period, further, standing, timbers, were, placed, at, the, northeast, entrance, and, a, parallel, alignment, of, posts, ran, inwards, from, the, southern, entrance, the, postholes, are, smaller, than, the, aubrey, holes, being, only, around, 16, inches, 0, 4, m, in, diameter, and, are, much, less, regularly, spaced, the, bank, was, purposely, reduced, in, height, and, the, ditch, continued, to, silt, up, at, least, twenty, five, of, the, aubrey, holes, are, known, to, have, contained, later, intrusive, cremation, burials, dating, to, the, two, centuries, after, the, monument, s, inception, it, seems, that, whatever, the, holes, initial, function, it, changed, to, become, a, funerary, one, during, phase, two, thirty, further, cremations, were, placed, in, the, enclosure, s, ditch, and, at, other, points, within, the, monument, mostly, in, the, eastern, half, stonehenge, is, therefore, interpreted, as, functioning, as, an, enclosed, cremation, cemetery, at, this, time, the, earliest, known, cremation, cemetery, in, the, british, isles, fragments, of, unburnt, human, bone, have, also, been, found, in, the, ditch, fill, dating, evidence, is, provided, by, the, late, neolithic, grooved, ware, pottery, that, has, been, found, in, connection, with, the, features, from, this, phase, archaeological, excavation, has, indicated, that, around, 2600, bc, the, builders, abandoned, timber, in, favour, of, stone, and, dug, two, concentric, arrays, of, holes, the, q, and, r, holes, in, the, centre, of, the, site, these, stone, sockets, are, only, partly, known, hence, on, present, evidence, are, sometimes, described, as, forming, crescents, however, they, could, be, the, remains, of, a, double, ring, again, there, is, little, firm, dating, evidence, for, this, phase, the, holes, held, up, to, 80, standing, stones, shown, blue, on, the, plan, only, 43, of, which, can, be, traced, today, it, is, generally, accepted, that, the, bluestones, some, of, which, are, made, of, dolerite, an, igneous, rock, were, transported, by, the, builders, from, the, preseli, hills, 150, miles, 240, km, away, in, modern, day, pembrokeshire, in, wales, another, theory, is, that, they, were, brought, much, nearer, to, the, site, as, glacial, erratics, by, the, irish, sea, glacier, although, there, is, no, evidence, of, glacial, deposition, within, southern, central, england, a, 2019, publication, announced, that, evidence, of, megalithic, quarrying, had, been, found, at, quarries, in, wales, identified, as, a, source, of, stonehenge, s, bluestone, indicating, that, the, bluestone, was, quarried, by, human, agency, and, not, transported, by, glacial, action, the, long, distance, human, transport, theory, was, bolstered, in, 2011, by, the, discovery, of, a, megalithic, bluestone, quarry, at, craig, rhos, y, felin, near, crymych, in, pembrokeshire, which, is, the, most, likely, place, for, some, of, the, stones, to, have, been, obtained, other, standing, stones, may, well, have, been, small, sarsens, sandstone, used, later, as, lintels, the, stones, which, weighed, about, two, tons, could, have, been, moved, by, lifting, and, carrying, them, on, rows, of, poles, and, rectangular, frameworks, of, poles, as, recorded, in, china, japan, and, india, it, is, not, known, whether, the, stones, were, taken, directly, from, their, quarries, to, salisbury, plain, or, were, the, result, of, the, removal, of, a, venerated, stone, circle, from, preseli, to, salisbury, plain, to, merge, two, sacred, centres, into, one, to, unify, two, politically, separate, regions, or, to, legitimise, the, ancestral, identity, of, migrants, moving, from, one, region, to, another, evidence, of, a, 110, metre, 360, ft, stone, circle, at, waun, mawn, near, preseli, which, could, have, contained, some, or, all, of, the, stones, in, stonehenge, has, been, found, including, a, hole, from, a, rock, that, matches, the, unusual, cross, section, of, a, stonehenge, bluestone, like, a, key, in, a, lock, each, monolith, measures, around, 6, 6, feet, 2, m, in, height, between, 3, 3, and, 4, 9, ft, 1, and, 1, 5, m, wide, and, around, 2, 6, feet, 0, 8, m, thick, what, was, to, become, known, as, the, altar, stone, was, believed, to, have, been, derived, from, the, senni, beds, perhaps, from, 50, miles, 80, kilometres, east, of, the, preseli, hills, in, the, brecon, beacons, work, announced, in, 2024, by, a, team, from, curtin, university, who, analysed, the, chemical, composition, of, fragments, of, rock, that, had, fallen, off, the, altar, stone, and, dated, them, found, that, the, best, match, was, with, rocks, in, the, orcadian, basin, which, includes, caithness, orkney, and, the, moray, firth, regions, of, north, eastern, scotland, the, researchers, stated, that, this, implies, the, stone, was, transported, some, 430, miles, 690, km, and, thus, demonstrates, cultural, links, between, southern, england, and, northern, scotland, the, north, eastern, entrance, was, widened, at, this, time, with, the, result, that, it, precisely, matched, the, direction, of, the, midsummer, sunrise, and, midwinter, sunset, of, the, period, this, phase, of, the, monument, was, abandoned, unfinished, however, the, small, standing, stones, were, apparently, removed, and, the, q, and, r, holes, purposefully, backfilled, the, heel, stone, a, tertiary, sandstone, may, also, have, been, erected, outside, the, north, eastern, entrance, during, this, period, it, cannot, be, accurately, dated, and, may, have, been, installed, at, any, time, during, phase, 3, at, first, it, was, accompanied, by, a, second, stone, which, is, no, longer, visible, two, or, possibly, three, large, portal, stones, were, set, up, just, inside, the, north, eastern, entrance, of, which, only, one, the, fallen, slaughter, stone, 16, feet, 4, 9, m, long, now, remains, other, features, loosely, dated, to, phase, 3, include, the, four, station, stones, two, of, which, stood, atop, mounds, the, mounds, are, known, as, barrows, although, they, do, not, contain, burials, stonehenge, avenue, a, parallel, pair, of, ditches, and, banks, leading, two, miles, 3, km, to, the, river, avon, was, also, added, during, the, next, major, phase, of, activity, 30, enormous, oligocene, miocene, sarsen, stones, shown, grey, on, the, plan, were, brought, to, the, site, they, came, from, a, quarry, around, 16, miles, 26, km, north, of, stonehenge, in, west, woods, wiltshire, the, stones, were, dressed, and, fashioned, with, mortise, and, tenon, joints, before, 30, sarsens, were, erected, in, a, circle, of, standing, stones, approximately, 98, feet, 30, m, in, diameter, with, a, ring, of, 30, lintel, stones, resting, on, top, the, lintels, were, fitted, to, one, another, using, tongue, and, groove, joints, a, woodworking, method, again, each, standing, stone, was, around, 13, 5, feet, 4, 11, m, high, 7, 0, feet, 2, 13, m, wide, and, 3, 5, feet, 1, 06, m, deep, weighing, around, 26, tons, each, had, clearly, been, worked, with, the, final, visual, effect, in, mind, the, orthostats, widen, slightly, towards, the, top, in, order, that, their, perspective, remains, constant, when, viewed, from, the, ground, while, the, lintel, stones, curve, slightly, to, continue, the, circular, appearance, of, the, earlier, monument, the, inward, facing, surfaces, of, the, stones, are, smoother, and, more, finely, worked, than, the, outer, surfaces, the, average, thickness, of, the, stones, is, 3, 6, feet, 1, 1, m, and, the, average, distance, between, them, is, 3, 3, feet, 1, m, a, total, of, 75, stones, would, have, been, needed, to, complete, the, circle, 60, stones, and, the, trilithon, horseshoe, 15, stones, it, was, thought, the, ring, might, have, been, left, incomplete, but, an, exceptionally, dry, summer, in, 2013, revealed, patches, of, parched, grass, which, may, correspond, to, the, location, of, missing, sarsens, the, lintel, stones, are, each, around, 10, feet, 3, 2, m, long, 3, 3, feet, 1, m, wide, and, 2, 6, feet, 0, 8, m, thick, the, tops, of, the, lintels, are, 16, feet, 4, 9, m, above, the, ground, within, this, circle, stood, five, trilithons, of, dressed, sarsen, stone, arranged, in, a, horseshoe, shape, 45, feet, 13, 7, m, across, with, its, open, end, facing, northeast, these, huge, stones, ten, uprights, and, five, lintels, weigh, up, to, 50, tons, each, they, were, linked, using, complex, jointing, they, are, arranged, symmetrically, the, smallest, pair, of, trilithons, were, around, 20, feet, 6, m, tall, the, next, pair, a, little, higher, and, the, largest, single, trilithon, in, the, south, west, corner, would, have, been, 24, feet, 7, 3, m, tall, only, one, upright, from, the, great, trilithon, still, stands, of, which, 22, feet, 6, 7, m, is, visible, and, a, further, 7, 9, feet, 2, 4, m, is, below, ground, the, images, of, a, dagger, and, 14, axeheads, have, been, carved, on, one, of, the, sarsens, known, as, stone, 53, further, carvings, of, axeheads, have, been, seen, on, the, outer, faces, of, stones, 3, 4, and, 5, the, carvings, are, difficult, to, date, but, are, morphologically, similar, to, late, bronze, age, weapons, early, 21st, century, laser, scanning, of, the, carvings, supports, this, interpretation, the, pair, of, trilithons, in, the, north, east, are, smallest, measuring, around, 20, feet, 6, m, in, height, the, largest, which, is, in, the, south, west, of, the, horseshoe, is, almost, 25, feet, 7, 5, m, tall, this, ambitious, phase, has, been, radiocarbon, dated, to, between, 2600, and, 2400, bc, slightly, earlier, than, the, stonehenge, archer, discovered, in, the, outer, ditch, of, the, monument, in, 1978, and, the, two, sets, of, burials, known, as, the, amesbury, archer, and, the, boscombe, bowmen, discovered, three, miles, 5, km, to, the, west, analysis, of, animal, teeth, found, two, miles, 3, km, away, at, durrington, walls, thought, by, parker, pearson, to, be, the, builders, camp, suggests, that, during, some, period, between, 2600, and, 2400, bc, as, many, as, 4, 000, people, gathered, at, the, site, for, the, mid, winter, and, mid, summer, festivals, the, evidence, showed, that, the, animals, had, been, slaughtered, around, nine, months, or, 15, months, after, their, spring, birth, strontium, isotope, analysis, of, the, animal, teeth, showed, that, some, had, been, brought, from, as, far, afield, as, the, scottish, highlands, for, the, celebrations, at, about, the, same, time, a, large, timber, circle, and, a, second, avenue, were, constructed, at, durrington, walls, overlooking, the, river, avon, the, timber, circle, was, orientated, towards, the, rising, sun, on, the, midwinter, solstice, opposing, the, solar, alignments, at, stonehenge, the, avenue, was, aligned, with, the, setting, sun, on, the, summer, solstice, and, led, from, the, river, to, the, timber, circle, evidence, of, huge, fires, on, the, banks, of, the, avon, between, the, two, avenues, also, suggests, that, both, circles, were, linked, they, were, perhaps, used, as, a, procession, route, on, the, longest, and, shortest, days, of, the, year, parker, pearson, speculates, that, the, wooden, circle, at, durrington, walls, was, the, centre, of, a, land, of, the, living, whilst, the, stone, circle, represented, a, land, of, the, dead, with, the, avon, serving, as, a, journey, between, the, two, later, in, the, bronze, age, although, the, exact, details, of, activities, during, this, period, are, still, unclear, the, bluestones, appear, to, have, been, re, erected, they, were, placed, within, the, outer, sarsen, circle, and, may, have, been, trimmed, in, some, way, like, the, sarsens, a, few, have, timber, working, style, cuts, in, them, suggesting, that, during, this, phase, they, may, have, been, linked, with, lintels, and, were, part, of, a, larger, structure, this, phase, saw, further, rearrangement, of, the, bluestones, they, were, arranged, in, a, circle, between, the, two, rings, of, sarsens, and, in, an, oval, at, the, centre, of, the, inner, ring, some, archaeologists, argue, that, some, of, these, bluestones, were, from, a, second, group, brought, from, wales, all, the, stones, formed, well, spaced, uprights, without, any, of, the, linking, lintels, inferred, in, stonehenge, 3, iii, the, altar, stone, may, have, been, moved, within, the, oval, at, this, time, and, re, erected, vertically, although, this, would, seem, the, most, impressive, phase, of, work, stonehenge, 3, iv, was, rather, shabbily, built, compared, to, its, immediate, predecessors, as, the, newly, re, installed, bluestones, were, not, well, founded, and, began, to, fall, over, however, only, minor, changes, were, made, after, this, phase, soon, afterwards, the, northeastern, section, of, the, phase, 3, iv, bluestone, circle, was, removed, creating, a, horseshoe, shaped, setting, the, bluestone, horseshoe, which, mirrored, the, shape, of, the, central, sarsen, trilithons, this, phase, is, contemporary, with, the, seahenge, site, in, norfolk, the, y, and, z, holes, are, the, last, known, construction, at, stonehenge, built, about, 1600, bc, and, the, last, usage, of, it, was, probably, during, the, iron, age, roman, coins, and, medieval, artefacts, have, all, been, found, in, or, around, the, monument, but, it, is, unknown, if, the, monument, was, in, continuous, use, throughout, british, prehistory, and, beyond, or, exactly, how, it, would, have, been, used, notable, is, the, massive, iron, age, hillfort, known, as, vespasian, s, camp, despite, its, name, not, a, roman, site, built, alongside, the, avenue, near, the, avon, a, decapitated, seventh, century, saxon, man, was, excavated, from, stonehenge, in, 1923, the, site, was, known, to, scholars, during, the, middle, ages, and, since, then, it, has, been, studied, and, adopted, by, numerous, groups, stonehenge, was, produced, by, a, culture, that, left, no, written, records, many, aspects, of, stonehenge, such, as, how, it, was, built, and, for, what, purposes, it, was, used, remain, subject, to, debate, a, number, of, myths, surround, the, stones, the, site, specifically, the, great, trilithon, the, encompassing, horseshoe, arrangement, of, the, five, central, trilithons, the, heel, stone, and, the, embanked, avenue, are, aligned, to, the, sunset, of, the, winter, solstice, and, the, opposing, sunrise, of, the, summer, solstice, a, natural, landform, at, the, monument, s, location, followed, this, line, and, may, have, inspired, its, construction, it, has, been, conjectured, that, the, design, of, the, monument, included, a, celestial, observatory, function, which, might, allow, prediction, of, eclipse, solstice, equinox, and, other, celestial, events, important, to, the, builders, belief, system, the, excavated, remains, of, culled, animal, bones, suggest, that, people, may, have, gathered, at, the, site, for, the, winter, rather, than, the, summer, there, is, little, or, no, direct, evidence, revealing, the, construction, techniques, used, by, the, stonehenge, builders, over, the, years, various, authors, have, suggested, that, supernatural, or, anachronistic, methods, were, used, usually, asserting, that, the, stones, were, impossible, to, move, otherwise, due, to, their, massive, size, however, conventional, techniques, using, neolithic, technology, as, basic, as, shear, legs, have, been, demonstrably, effective, at, moving, and, placing, stones, of, a, similar, size, the, most, common, theory, of, how, prehistoric, people, moved, megaliths, has, them, creating, a, track, of, logs, which, the, large, stones, were, rolled, along, another, megalith, transport, theory, involves, the, use, of, a, type, of, sleigh, running, on, a, track, greased, with, animal, fat, an, experiment, with, a, sleigh, carrying, a, 40, ton, slab, of, stone, was, successfully, conducted, near, stonehenge, in, 1995, a, team, of, more, than, 100, workers, managed, to, push, and, pull, the, slab, along, the, 18, mile, 29, km, journey, from, the, marlborough, downs, proposed, functions, for, the, site, include, usage, as, an, astronomical, observatory, or, as, a, religious, site, in, the, 1960s, gerald, hawkins, described, in, detail, how, the, site, was, apparently, set, out, to, observe, the, sun, and, moon, over, a, recurring, 56, year, cycle, more, recently, two, major, new, theories, have, been, proposed, geoffrey, wainwright, president, of, the, society, of, antiquaries, of, london, and, timothy, darvill, of, bournemouth, university, have, suggested, that, stonehenge, was, a, place, of, healing, the, primeval, equivalent, of, lourdes, they, argue, that, this, accounts, for, the, high, number, of, burials, in, the, area, and, for, the, evidence, of, trauma, deformity, in, some, of, the, graves, however, they, do, concede, that, the, site, was, probably, multifunctional, and, used, for, ancestor, worship, as, well, isotope, analysis, indicates, that, some, of, the, buried, individuals, were, from, other, regions, a, teenage, boy, buried, approximately, 1550, bc, was, raised, near, the, mediterranean, sea, a, metal, worker, from, 2300, bc, dubbed, the, amesbury, archer, grew, up, near, the, alpine, foothills, of, germany, and, the, boscombe, bowmen, probably, arrived, from, wales, or, brittany, france, on, the, other, hand, mike, parker, pearson, of, sheffield, university, has, suggested, that, stonehenge, was, part, of, a, ritual, landscape, and, was, joined, to, durrington, walls, by, their, corresponding, avenues, and, the, river, avon, he, suggests, that, the, area, around, durrington, walls, henge, was, a, place, of, the, living, whilst, stonehenge, was, a, domain, of, the, dead, a, journey, along, the, avon, to, reach, stonehenge, was, part, of, a, ritual, passage, from, life, to, death, to, celebrate, past, ancestors, and, the, recently, deceased, both, explanations, were, first, mooted, in, the, twelfth, century, by, geoffrey, of, monmouth, who, extolled, the, curative, properties, of, the, stones, and, was, also, the, first, to, advance, the, idea, that, stonehenge, was, constructed, as, a, funerary, monument, there, are, other, hypotheses, and, theories, according, to, a, team, of, british, researchers, led, by, mike, parker, pearson, of, the, university, of, sheffield, stonehenge, may, have, been, built, as, a, symbol, of, peace, and, unity, indicated, in, part, by, the, fact, that, at, the, time, of, its, construction, britain, s, neolithic, people, were, experiencing, a, period, of, cultural, unification, stonehenge, megaliths, include, smaller, bluestones, and, larger, sarsens, a, term, for, silicified, sandstone, boulders, found, in, the, chalk, downs, of, southern, england, the, bluestones, are, composed, of, dolerite, tuff, rhyolite, or, sandstone, the, igneous, bluestones, appear, to, have, originated, in, the, preseli, hills, of, southwestern, wales, about, 140, miles, 230, km, from, the, monument, the, sandstone, altar, stone, may, have, originated, in, east, wales, analysis, published, in, 2020, indicates, the, sarsens, came, from, west, woods, about, 16, miles, 26, km, from, the, monument, researchers, from, the, royal, college, of, art, in, london, have, discovered, that, the, monument, s, igneous, bluestones, possess, unusual, acoustic, properties, when, struck, they, respond, with, a, loud, clanging, noise, rocks, with, such, acoustic, properties, are, frequent, in, the, carn, melyn, ridge, of, presili, the, presili, village, of, maenclochog, welsh, for, bell, or, ringing, stones, used, local, bluestones, as, church, bells, until, the, 18th, century, according, to, the, team, these, acoustic, properties, could, explain, why, certain, bluestones, were, hauled, such, a, long, distance, a, major, technical, accomplishment, at, the, time, in, certain, ancient, cultures, rocks, that, ring, out, known, as, lithophonic, rocks, were, believed, to, contain, mystic, or, healing, powers, and, stonehenge, has, a, history, of, association, with, rituals, the, presence, of, these, ringing, rocks, seems, to, support, the, hypothesis, that, stonehenge, was, a, place, for, healing, put, forward, by, darvill, who, consulted, with, the, researchers, there, is, evidence, to, suggest, that, despite, the, introduction, of, farming, in, the, british, isles, the, practice, of, cereal, cultivation, fell, out, of, favor, between, 3300, and, 1500, bc, with, much, of, the, population, reverting, to, a, pastoralist, subsistence, pattern, focused, on, hazelnut, gathering, and, pig, and, cattle, rearing, a, majority, of, the, major, phases, of, stonehenge, s, construction, took, place, during, such, a, period, where, evidence, of, large, scale, agriculture, is, equivocal, similar, associations, between, non, cereal, farming, subsistence, patterns, and, monumental, construction, are, also, seen, at, poverty, point, and, sannai, maruyama, researchers, studying, dna, extracted, from, neolithic, human, remains, across, britain, determined, that, the, people, who, built, stonehenge, i, and, ii, were, closely, related, to, iberian, and, central, european, early, and, middle, neolithic, populations, modelled, as, having, about, 75, ancestry, from, early, european, farmers, who, came, from, the, eastern, mediterranean, travelling, west, from, there, and, 25, ancestry, coming, from, western, hunter, gatherers, from, western, europe, these, farmers, moved, to, iberia, before, heading, north, reaching, britain, in, about, 4, 000, bc, most, of, the, ancestry, of, british, neolithic, farmers, came, from, the, people, who, followed, this, route, with, a, minor, contribution, from, groups, who, followed, the, danube, into, central, and, western, europe, their, agricultural, techniques, seem, to, have, come, originally, from, anatolia, and, their, mixture, appears, to, have, happened, primarily, on, the, continent, before, the, neolithic, farmers, migrated, to, britain, at, the, time, of, their, arrival, britain, was, inhabited, by, groups, of, hunter, gatherers, who, were, the, first, inhabitants, of, the, island, after, the, last, ice, age, ended, about, 11, 700, years, ago, the, farmers, replaced, most, of, the, hunter, gatherer, population, in, the, british, isles, without, mixing, much, with, them, despite, their, mostly, aegean, ancestry, the, paternal, y, dna, lineages, of, neolithic, farmers, in, britain, were, almost, exclusively, of, western, hunter, gatherer, origin, this, was, also, the, case, among, other, megalithic, building, populations, in, northwest, europe, meaning, that, these, populations, were, descended, from, a, mixture, of, hunter, gatherer, males, and, farmer, females, the, dominance, of, western, hunter, gatherer, male, lineages, in, britain, and, northwest, europe, is, also, reflected, in, a, general, resurgence, of, hunter, gatherer, ancestry, predominantly, from, males, across, western, and, central, europe, in, the, middle, neolithic, at, the, time, the, megalithic, stonehenge, 3, ii, was, constructed, 2600, 2400, bc, by, neolithic, people, the, bell, beaker, people, arrived, around, 2, 500, bc, migrating, from, mainland, europe, they, lived, side, by, side, for, ca, 500, years, with, the, bell, beaker, people, probably, incorporating, the, henge, structures, into, their, belief, system, the, earliest, british, individuals, associated, with, the, beaker, culture, most, likely, speakers, of, indo, european, languages, whose, ancestors, migrated, from, the, pontic, caspian, steppe, were, similar, to, those, from, the, rhine, eventually, there, was, again, a, large, population, replacement, in, britain, more, than, 90, of, britain, s, neolithic, gene, pool, was, replaced, with, the, arrival, of, the, bell, beaker, people, who, had, approximately, 50, wsh, ancestry, the, heel, stone, lies, northeast, of, the, sarsen, circle, beside, the, end, portion, of, stonehenge, avenue, it, is, a, rough, stone, 16, feet, 4, 9, m, above, ground, leaning, inwards, towards, the, stone, circle, it, has, been, known, by, many, names, in, the, past, including, friar, s, heel, and, sun, stone, at, the, summer, solstice, an, observer, standing, within, the, stone, circle, looking, northeast, through, the, entrance, would, see, the, sun, rise, in, the, approximate, direction, of, the, heel, stone, and, the, sun, has, often, been, photographed, over, it, a, folk, tale, relates, the, origin, of, the, friar, s, heel, reference, the, devil, bought, the, stones, from, a, woman, in, ireland, wrapped, them, up, and, brought, them, to, salisbury, plain, one, of, the, stones, fell, into, the, avon, the, rest, were, carried, to, the, plain, the, devil, then, cried, out, no, one, will, ever, find, out, how, these, stones, came, here, a, friar, replied, that, s, what, you, think, whereupon, the, devil, threw, one, of, the, stones, at, him, and, struck, him, on, the, heel, the, stone, stuck, in, the, ground, and, is, still, there, brewer, s, dictionary, of, phrase, and, fable, attributes, this, tale, to, geoffrey, of, monmouth, but, though, book, eight, of, geoffrey, s, historia, regum, britanniae, does, describe, how, stonehenge, was, built, the, two, stories, are, entirely, different, the, name, is, not, unique, there, was, a, monolith, with, the, same, name, recorded, in, the, nineteenth, century, by, antiquarian, charles, warne, at, long, bredy, in, dorset, the, twelfth, century, historia, regum, britanniae, history, of, the, kings, of, britain, by, geoffrey, of, monmouth, includes, a, legend, of, stonehenge, s, origin, describing, how, stonehenge, was, brought, from, ireland, with, the, help, of, the, wizard, merlin, geoffrey, s, story, spread, widely, with, variations, of, it, appearing, in, adaptations, of, his, work, such, as, wace, s, norman, french, roman, de, brut, layamon, s, middle, english, brut, and, the, welsh, brut, y, brenhinedd, according, to, the, tale, the, stones, of, stonehenge, were, healing, stones, which, giants, had, brought, from, africa, to, ireland, they, had, been, raised, on, mount, killaraus, to, form, a, stone, circle, known, as, the, giant, s, ring, or, giant, s, round, the, fifth, century, king, aurelius, ambrosius, wished, to, build, a, great, memorial, to, the, british, celtic, nobles, slain, by, the, saxons, at, salisbury, merlin, advised, him, to, use, the, giant, s, ring, the, king, sent, merlin, and, uther, pendragon, king, arthur, s, father, with, 15, 000, men, to, bring, it, from, ireland, they, defeated, an, irish, army, led, by, gillomanius, but, were, unable, to, move, the, huge, stones, with, merlin, s, help, they, transported, the, stones, to, britain, and, re, erected, them, as, they, had, stood, mount, killaraus, may, refer, to, the, hill, of, uisneach, although, the, tale, is, fiction, archaeologist, mike, parker, pearson, suggests, it, may, hold, a, grain, of, truth, as, evidence, suggests, the, stonehenge, bluestones, were, brought, from, the, waun, mawn, stone, circle, on, the, irish, sea, coast, of, wales, another, legend, tells, how, the, invading, saxon, king, hengist, invited, british, celtic, warriors, to, a, feast, but, treacherously, ordered, his, men, to, massacre, the, guests, killing, 420, of, them, hengist, erected, stonehenge, on, the, site, to, show, his, remorse, for, the, deed, stonehenge, has, changed, ownership, several, times, since, king, henry, viii, acquired, amesbury, abbey, and, its, surrounding, lands, in, 1540, henry, gave, the, estate, to, the, earl, of, hertford, it, subsequently, passed, to, lord, carleton, and, then, the, marquess, of, queensberry, the, antrobus, family, of, cheshire, bought, the, estate, in, 1824, stonehenge, was, one, of, several, lots, put, up, for, auction, in, 1915, by, sir, cosmo, gordon, antrobus, soon, after, he, had, inherited, the, estate, from, his, brother, the, auction, by, knight, frank, rutley, estate, agents, in, salisbury, was, held, on, 21, september, 1915, and, included, lot, 15, stonehenge, with, about, 30, acres, 2, rods, 37, perches, of, adjoining, downland, cecil, chubb, bought, the, site, for, 6, 600, 668, 000, in, 2024, and, gave, it, to, the, nation, three, years, later, with, certain, conditions, attached, although, it, has, been, speculated, that, he, purchased, it, at, the, suggestion, of, or, even, as, a, present, for, his, wife, in, fact, he, bought, it, on, a, whim, as, he, believed, a, local, man, should, be, the, new, owner, the, plot, bought, by, chubb, and, gifted, to, the, nation, was, only, 30, acres, 12, ha, in, size, and, various, buildings, stood, within, clear, sight, of, the, monument, the, most, prominent, being, stonehenge, aerodrome, some, 300, metres, 980, ft, from, the, stones, the, aerodrome, was, built, during, the, first, world, war, for, the, royal, flying, corps, and, its, large, stone, and, brick, hangars, dominated, the, skyline, in, the, dry, valley, at, stonehenge, bottom, a, main, road, junction, was, built, between, what, would, later, be, designated, as, the, a303, and, a344, roads, along, with, several, cottages, and, a, cafe, in, 1927, the, land, around, stonehenge, was, put, up, for, auction, in, three, plots, plot, a, lay, immediately, west, of, the, monument, and, included, the, by, now, disused, stonehenge, aerodrome, plot, b, was, to, the, south, on, the, other, side, of, the, main, road, and, plot, c, on, the, north, side, included, part, of, the, stonehenge, cursus, there, was, interest, from, developers, and, in, august, 1927, a, subscription, fund, was, launched, in, order, to, save, the, skyline, of, the, monument, the, subscription, made, rapid, progress, with, george, v, as, the, lead, subscriber, and, by, october, 1927, 8, 000, had, been, raised, which, was, enough, to, purchase, plot, a, and, start, the, demolition, of, the, aerodrome, the, fund, continued, for, a, number, of, years, to, secure, the, remaining, land, around, the, henge, for, the, nation, with, fundraising, for, plot, c, continuing, through, 1929, the, land, was, taken, into, the, management, of, the, national, trust, to, preserve, the, last, large, aircraft, hangar, was, removed, in, 1930, and, by, the, middle, of, the, 1930s, the, aerodrome, site, was, cleared, more, recently, the, land, has, been, part, of, a, grassland, reversion, scheme, returning, the, surrounding, fields, to, native, chalk, grassland, during, the, twentieth, century, stonehenge, began, to, revive, as, a, place, of, religious, significance, this, time, by, adherents, of, neopaganism, and, new, age, beliefs, particularly, the, neo, druids, the, historian, ronald, hutton, would, later, remark, that, it, was, a, great, and, potentially, uncomfortable, irony, that, modern, druids, had, arrived, at, stonehenge, just, as, archaeologists, were, evicting, the, ancient, druids, from, it, the, first, such, neo, druidic, group, to, make, use, of, the, megalithic, monument, was, the, ancient, order, of, druids, who, performed, a, mass, initiation, ceremony, there, in, august, 1905, in, which, they, admitted, 259, new, members, into, their, organisation, this, assembly, was, largely, ridiculed, in, the, press, who, mocked, the, fact, that, the, neo, druids, were, dressed, up, in, costumes, consisting, of, white, robes, and, fake, beards, the, earlier, rituals, were, complemented, by, the, stonehenge, free, festival, loosely, organised, by, the, polytantric, circle, held, between, 1972, and, 1984, during, which, time, the, number, of, midsummer, visitors, had, risen, to, around, 30, 000, however, in, 1985, the, site, was, closed, to, festivalgoers, by, a, high, court, injunction, a, consequence, of, the, end, of, the, festival, in, 1985, was, the, violent, confrontation, between, the, police, and, new, age, travellers, that, became, known, as, the, battle, of, the, beanfield, when, police, blockaded, a, convoy, of, travellers, to, prevent, them, from, approaching, stonehenge, beginning, in, 1985, the, year, of, the, battle, no, access, was, allowed, into, the, stones, at, stonehenge, for, any, religious, reason, this, exclusion, zone, policy, continued, for, almost, fifteen, years, until, just, before, the, arrival, of, the, twenty, first, century, visitors, were, not, allowed, to, go, into, the, stones, at, times, of, religious, significance, the, winter, and, summer, solstices, and, the, vernal, and, autumnal, equinoxes, however, following, a, european, court, of, human, rights, ruling, obtained, by, campaigners, such, as, arthur, uther, pendragon, the, restrictions, were, lifted, the, ruling, recognized, that, members, of, any, genuine, religion, have, a, right, to, worship, in, their, own, church, and, stonehenge, is, a, place, of, worship, to, neo, druids, pagans, and, other, earth, based, or, old, religions, meetings, were, organised, by, the, national, trust, and, others, to, discuss, the, arrangements, in, 1998, a, party, of, 100, people, was, allowed, access, and, these, included, astronomers, archaeologists, druids, locals, pagans, and, travellers, in, 2000, an, open, summer, solstice, event, was, held, and, about, seven, thousand, people, attended, in, 2001, the, numbers, increased, to, about, 10, 000, when, stonehenge, was, first, opened, to, the, public, it, was, possible, to, walk, among, and, even, climb, on, the, stones, but, the, stones, were, roped, off, in, 1977, as, a, result, of, serious, erosion, visitors, are, no, longer, permitted, to, touch, the, stones, but, are, able, to, walk, around, the, monument, from, a, short, distance, away, english, heritage, does, however, permit, access, during, the, summer, and, winter, solstice, and, the, spring, and, autumn, equinox, additionally, visitors, can, make, special, bookings, to, access, the, stones, throughout, the, year, approximately, 30, 000, local, residents, are, entitled, to, free, admission, to, stonehenge, under, an, agreement, dating, back, to, 1921, the, access, situation, and, the, proximity, of, the, two, roads, have, drawn, widespread, criticism, highlighted, by, a, 2006, national, geographic, survey, in, the, survey, of, conditions, at, 94, leading, world, heritage, sites, 400, conservation, and, tourism, experts, ranked, stonehenge, 75th, in, the, list, of, destinations, declaring, it, to, be, in, moderate, trouble, as, motorised, traffic, increased, the, setting, of, the, monument, began, to, be, affected, by, the, proximity, of, the, two, roads, on, either, side, the, a344, to, shrewton, on, the, north, side, and, the, a303, to, winterbourne, stoke, to, the, south, plans, to, upgrade, the, a303, and, close, the, a344, to, restore, the, vista, from, the, stones, have, been, considered, since, the, monument, became, a, world, heritage, site, however, the, controversy, surrounding, expensive, re, routing, of, the, roads, has, led, to, the, scheme, being, cancelled, on, multiple, occasions, on, 6, december, 2007, it, was, announced, that, extensive, plans, to, build, stonehenge, road, tunnel, under, the, landscape, and, create, a, permanent, visitors, centre, had, been, cancelled, on, 13, may, 2009, the, government, gave, approval, for, a, 25, million, scheme, to, create, a, smaller, visitors, centre, and, close, the, a344, although, this, was, dependent, on, funding, and, local, authority, planning, consent, on, 20, january, 2010, wiltshire, council, granted, planning, permission, for, a, centre, 1, 5, mi, 2, 4, kilometres, to, the, west, and, english, heritage, confirmed, that, funds, to, build, it, would, be, available, supported, by, a, 10m, grant, from, the, heritage, lottery, fund, on, 23, june, 2013, the, a344, was, closed, to, begin, the, work, of, removing, the, section, of, road, and, replacing, it, with, grass, the, centre, designed, by, denton, corker, marshall, opened, to, the, public, on, 18, december, 2013, throughout, recorded, history, stonehenge, and, its, surrounding, monuments, have, attracted, attention, from, antiquarians, and, archaeologists, john, aubrey, was, one, of, the, first, to, examine, the, site, with, a, scientific, eye, in, 1666, and, in, his, plan, of, the, monument, he, recorded, the, pits, that, now, bear, his, name, the, aubrey, holes, william, stukeley, continued, aubrey, s, work, in, the, early, eighteenth, century, but, took, an, interest, in, the, surrounding, monuments, as, well, identifying, somewhat, incorrectly, the, cursus, and, the, avenue, he, also, began, the, excavation, of, many, of, the, barrows, in, the, area, and, it, was, his, interpretation, of, the, landscape, that, associated, it, with, the, druids, stukeley, was, so, fascinated, with, druids, that, he, originally, named, disc, barrows, as, druids, barrows, the, most, accurate, early, plan, of, stonehenge, was, that, made, by, bath, architect, john, wood, in, 1740, his, original, annotated, survey, has, now, been, computer, redrawn, and, published, 195, importantly, wood, s, plan, was, made, before, the, collapse, of, the, southwest, trilithon, which, fell, in, 1797, and, was, restored, in, 1958, william, cunnington, was, the, next, to, tackle, the, area, in, the, early, nineteenth, century, he, excavated, some, 24, barrows, before, digging, in, and, around, the, stones, and, discovered, charred, wood, animal, bones, pottery, and, urns, he, also, identified, the, hole, in, which, the, slaughter, stone, once, stood, richard, colt, hoare, supported, cunnington, s, work, and, excavated, some, 379, barrows, on, salisbury, plain, including, on, some, 200, in, the, area, around, the, stones, some, excavated, in, conjunction, with, william, coxe, to, alert, future, diggers, to, their, work, they, were, careful, to, leave, initialled, metal, tokens, in, each, barrow, they, opened, cunnington, s, finds, are, displayed, at, the, wiltshire, museum, in, 1877, charles, darwin, dabbled, in, archaeology, at, the, stones, experimenting, with, the, rate, at, which, remains, sink, into, the, earth, for, his, book, the, formation, of, vegetable, mould, through, the, action, of, worms, stone, 22, fell, during, a, fierce, storm, on, 31, december, 1900, william, gowland, oversaw, the, first, major, restoration, of, the, monument, in, 1901, which, involved, the, straightening, and, concrete, setting, of, sarsen, stone, number, 56, which, was, in, danger, of, falling, in, straightening, the, stone, he, moved, it, about, half, a, metre, from, its, original, position, gowland, also, took, the, opportunity, to, further, excavate, the, monument, in, what, was, the, most, scientific, dig, to, date, revealing, more, about, the, erection, of, the, stones, than, the, previous, 100, years, of, work, had, done, during, the, 1920, restoration, william, hawley, who, had, excavated, nearby, old, sarum, excavated, the, base, of, six, stones, and, the, outer, ditch, he, also, located, a, bottle, of, port, in, the, slaughter, stone, socket, left, by, cunnington, helped, to, rediscover, aubrey, s, pits, inside, the, bank, and, located, the, concentric, circular, holes, outside, the, sarsen, circle, called, the, y, and, z, holes, richard, atkinson, stuart, piggott, and, john, f, s, stone, re, excavated, much, of, hawley, s, work, in, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, and, discovered, the, carved, axes, and, daggers, on, the, sarsen, stones, atkinson, s, work, was, instrumental, in, furthering, the, understanding, of, the, three, major, phases, of, the, monument, s, construction, in, 1958, the, stones, were, restored, again, when, three, of, the, standing, sarsens, were, re, erected, and, set, in, concrete, bases, the, last, restoration, was, carried, out, in, 1963, after, stone, 23, of, the, sarsen, circle, fell, over, it, was, again, re, erected, and, the, opportunity, was, taken, to, concrete, three, more, stones, later, archaeologists, including, christopher, chippindale, of, the, museum, of, archaeology, and, anthropology, university, of, cambridge, and, brian, edwards, of, the, university, of, the, west, of, england, campaigned, to, give, the, public, more, knowledge, of, the, various, restorations, and, in, 2004, english, heritage, included, pictures, of, the, work, in, progress, in, its, book, stonehenge, a, history, in, photographs, in, 1966, and, 1967, in, advance, of, a, new, car, park, being, built, at, the, site, the, area, of, land, immediately, northwest, of, the, stones, was, excavated, by, faith, and, lance, vatcher, they, discovered, the, mesolithic, postholes, dating, from, between, 7000, and, 8000, bc, as, well, as, a, 10, metre, 33, ft, length, of, a, palisade, ditch, a, v, cut, ditch, into, which, timber, posts, had, been, inserted, that, remained, there, until, they, rotted, away, subsequent, aerial, archaeology, suggests, that, this, ditch, runs, from, the, west, to, the, north, of, stonehenge, near, the, avenue, excavations, were, once, again, carried, out, in, 1978, by, atkinson, and, john, evans, during, which, they, discovered, the, remains, of, the, stonehenge, archer, in, the, outer, ditch, and, in, 1979, rescue, archaeology, was, needed, alongside, the, heel, stone, after, a, cable, laying, ditch, was, mistakenly, dug, on, the, roadside, revealing, a, new, stone, hole, next, to, the, heel, stone, in, the, early, 1980s, julian, c, richards, led, the, stonehenge, environs, project, a, detailed, study, of, the, surrounding, landscape, the, project, was, able, to, successfully, date, such, features, as, the, lesser, cursus, coneybury, henge, and, several, other, smaller, features, in, 1993, the, way, that, stonehenge, was, presented, to, the, public, was, called, a, national, disgrace, by, the, house, of, commons, public, accounts, committee, part, of, english, heritage, s, response, to, this, criticism, was, to, commission, research, to, collate, and, bring, together, all, the, archaeological, work, conducted, at, the, monument, up, to, this, date, this, two, year, research, project, resulted, in, the, publication, in, 1995, of, the, monograph, stonehenge, in, its, landscape, which, was, the, first, publication, presenting, the, complex, stratigraphy, and, the, finds, recovered, from, the, site, it, presented, a, rephasing, of, the, monument, more, recent, excavations, include, a, series, of, digs, held, between, 2003, and, 2008, known, as, the, stonehenge, riverside, project, led, by, mike, parker, pearson, this, project, mainly, investigated, other, monuments, in, the, landscape, and, their, relationship, to, the, stones, notably, durrington, walls, where, another, avenue, leading, to, the, river, avon, was, discovered, the, point, where, the, stonehenge, avenue, meets, the, river, was, also, excavated, and, revealed, a, previously, unknown, circular, area, which, probably, housed, four, further, stones, most, likely, as, a, marker, for, the, starting, point, of, the, avenue, in, april, 2008, tim, darvill, of, the, university, of, bournemouth, and, geoff, wainwright, of, the, society, of, antiquaries, began, another, dig, inside, the, stone, circle, to, retrieve, datable, fragments, of, the, original, bluestone, pillars, they, were, able, to, date, the, erection, of, some, bluestones, to, 2300, bc, although, this, may, not, reflect, the, earliest, erection, of, stones, at, stonehenge, they, also, discovered, organic, material, from, 7000, bc, which, along, with, the, mesolithic, postholes, adds, support, for, the, site, having, been, in, use, at, least, 4, 000, years, before, stonehenge, was, started, in, august, and, september, 2008, as, part, of, the, riverside, project, julian, c, richards, and, mike, pitts, excavated, aubrey, hole, 7, removing, the, cremated, remains, from, several, aubrey, holes, that, had, been, excavated, by, hawley, in, the, 1920s, and, re, interred, in, 1935, a, licence, for, the, removal, of, human, remains, at, stonehenge, had, been, granted, by, the, ministry, of, justice, in, may, 2008, in, accordance, with, the, statement, on, burial, law, and, archaeology, issued, in, may, 2008, one, of, the, conditions, of, the, licence, was, that, the, remains, should, be, reinterred, within, two, years, and, that, in, the, intervening, period, they, should, be, kept, safely, privately, and, decently, a, new, landscape, investigation, was, conducted, in, april, 2009, a, shallow, mound, rising, to, about, 16, in, 40, centimetres, was, identified, between, stones, 54, inner, circle, and, 10, outer, circle, clearly, separated, from, the, natural, slope, it, has, not, been, dated, but, speculation, that, it, represents, careless, backfilling, following, earlier, excavations, seems, disproved, by, its, representation, in, eighteenth, and, nineteenth, century, illustrations, there, is, some, evidence, that, as, an, uncommon, geological, feature, it, could, have, been, deliberately, incorporated, into, the, monument, at, the, outset, a, circular, shallow, bank, little, more, than, four, inches, 10, cm, high, was, found, between, the, y, and, z, hole, circles, with, a, further, bank, lying, inside, the, z, circle, these, are, interpreted, as, the, spread, of, spoil, from, the, original, y, and, z, holes, or, more, speculatively, as, hedge, banks, from, vegetation, deliberately, planted, to, screen, the, activities, within, in, 2010, the, stonehenge, hidden, landscape, project, discovered, a, henge, like, monument, less, than, 0, 62, mi, 1, km, away, from, the, main, site, this, new, hengiform, monument, was, subsequently, revealed, to, be, located, at, the, site, of, amesbury, 50, a, round, barrow, in, the, cursus, barrows, group, in, november, 2011, archaeologists, from, university, of, birmingham, announced, the, discovery, of, evidence, of, two, huge, pits, positioned, within, the, stonehenge, cursus, pathway, aligned, in, celestial, position, towards, midsummer, sunrise, and, sunset, when, viewed, from, the, heel, stone, the, new, discovery, was, made, as, part, of, the, stonehenge, hidden, landscape, project, which, began, in, the, summer, of, 2010, the, project, uses, non, invasive, geophysical, imaging, technique, to, reveal, and, visually, recreate, the, landscape, according, to, team, leader, vince, gaffney, this, discovery, may, provide, a, direct, link, between, the, rituals, and, astronomical, events, to, activities, within, the, cursus, at, stonehenge, in, december, 2011, geologists, from, university, of, leicester, and, the, national, museum, of, wales, announced, the, discovery, of, the, source, of, some, of, the, rhyolite, fragments, found, in, the, stonehenge, debitage, these, fragments, do, not, seem, to, match, any, of, the, standing, stones, or, bluestone, stumps, the, researchers, have, identified, the, source, as, a, 230, foot, 70, m, long, rock, outcrop, called, craig, rhos, y, felin, 51, 59, 30, n, 4, 44, 41, w, 51, 99167, n, 4, 74472, w, 51, 99167, 4, 74472, craig, rhos, y, felin, near, pont, saeson, in, north, pembrokeshire, located, 140, miles, 220, km, from, stonehenge, in, 2014, the, university, of, birmingham, announced, findings, including, evidence, of, adjacent, stone, and, wooden, structures, and, burial, mounds, near, durrington, overlooked, previously, that, may, date, as, far, back, as, 4000, bc, an, area, extending, to, 4, 6, square, miles, 12, km, 2, was, studied, to, a, depth, of, three, metres, with, ground, penetrating, radar, equipment, as, many, as, seventeen, new, monuments, revealed, nearby, may, be, late, neolithic, monuments, that, resemble, stonehenge, the, interpretation, suggests, a, complex, of, numerous, related, monuments, also, included, in, the, discovery, is, that, the, cursus, track, is, terminated, by, two, 16, foot, 5, m, wide, extremely, deep, pits, whose, purpose, is, still, a, mystery, an, announcement, in, november, 2020, stated, that, a, plan, to, construct, a, four, lane, tunnel, for, traffic, below, the, site, had, been, approved, this, was, intended, to, eliminate, the, section, of, the, a303, that, runs, close, to, the, circle, the, plan, had, received, opposition, from, a, group, of, archaeologists, environmentalists, and, modern, day, druids, according, to, national, geographic, but, was, supported, by, others, who, wanted, to, restore, the, landscape, to, its, original, setting, and, improve, the, experience, for, visitors, opponents, of, the, plan, were, concerned, that, artifacts, that, are, underground, in, the, area, would, be, lost, or, that, excavation, in, the, area, could, de, stabilize, the, stones, leading, to, their, sinking, shifting, or, perhaps, falling, in, february, 2021, archaeologists, announced, the, discovery, of, vast, troves, of, neolithic, and, bronze, age, artifacts, while, conducting, excavations, for, the, proposed, highway, tunnel, near, stonehenge, the, find, included, bronze, age, graves, late, neolithic, pottery, and, c, shaped, enclosure, on, the, intended, site, of, the, stonehenge, road, tunnel, remains, also, contained, a, shale, object, in, one, of, the, graves, burnt, flint, in, c, shaped, enclosure, and, the, final, resting, place, of, a, baby, in, january, 2022, archaeologists, announced, the, discovery, of, thousands, of, prehistoric, pits, during, an, electromagnetic, induction, field, survey, around, stonehenge, based, on, the, shape, of, the, pits, and, the, artifacts, found, inside, the, study, s, lead, author, philippe, de, smedt, assumed, that, six, of, the, 9, large, pits, excavated, were, made, by, prehistoric, humans, one, of, the, oldest, was, about, 10000, years, old, and, contained, hunting, tools, on, 14, july, 2023, the, department, for, transport, announced, that, despite, the, original, planning, application, having, been, overturned, by, the, high, court, in, 2021, the, transport, secretary, mark, harper, had, approved, plans, for, a, 2, mi, 3, 2, km, road, tunnel, on, 19, february, 2024, the, high, court, in, london, rejected, a, fresh, bid, by, campaigners, to, stop, the, road, tunnel, construction, a, further, legal, challenge, was, made, in, the, high, court, in, july, 2024, on, 19, june, 2024, environmental, activists, from, just, stop, oil, marked, three, standing, stones, by, spraying, them, with, orange, powder, paint, the, paint, was, removed, the, following, day, with, an, air, blower, to, avoid, damaging, the, stones, in, july, 2020, a, study, led, by, david, nash, of, the, university, of, brighton, concluded, that, the, large, sarsen, stones, were, a, direct, chemical, match, to, those, found, at, west, woods, near, marlborough, wiltshire, some, 15, miles, 25, km, north, of, stonehenge, a, core, sample, originally, extracted, in, 1958, had, recently, been, returned, first, the, fifty, two, sarsens, were, analysed, using, methods, including, x, ray, fluorescence, spectrometry, to, determine, their, chemical, composition, which, revealed, they, were, mostly, similar, then, the, core, was, destructively, analysed, and, compared, with, stone, samples, from, various, locations, in, southern, britain, fifty, of, the, fifty, two, megaliths, were, found, to, match, sarsens, in, west, woods, thereby, identifying, the, probable, origin, of, the, stones, during, 2017, and, 2018, excavations, by, professor, parker, pearson, s, team, at, waun, mawn, a, large, stone, circle, site, in, the, preseli, hills, suggested, that, the, site, had, originally, housed, a, 110, metre, 360, ft, diameter, stone, circle, of, the, same, size, as, stonehenge, s, original, bluestone, circle, also, orientated, towards, the, midsummer, solstice, the, circle, at, waun, mawn, also, contained, a, hole, from, one, stone, which, had, a, distinctive, pentagonal, shape, very, closely, matching, the, one, pentagonal, stone, at, stonehenge, stonehole, 91, at, waun, mawn, stone, 62, at, stonehenge, soil, dating, of, the, sediments, within, the, revealed, stone, holes, via, optically, stimulated, luminescence, osl, suggested, the, absent, stones, at, waun, mawn, had, been, erected, around, 3400, 3200, bc, and, removed, around, 300, 400, years, later, a, date, consistent, with, theories, that, the, same, stones, were, moved, and, used, at, stonehenge, before, later, being, reorganised, into, their, present, locations, and, supplemented, with, local, sarsens, as, was, already, understood, human, activity, at, waun, mawn, ceased, around, the, same, time, which, has, suggested, that, some, people, may, have, migrated, to, stonehenge, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, stones, from, other, sources, may, have, been, added, to, stonehenge, perhaps, from, other, dismantled, circles, in, the, region, further, work, in, 2021, by, parker, pearson, s, team, concluded, that, the, waun, mawn, circle, had, never, been, completed, and, of, the, stones, which, might, once, have, stood, at, the, site, no, more, than, 13, had, been, removed, in, antiquity, in, august, 2024, the, journal, nature, published, research, from, a, team, at, curtin, university, in, australia, identifying, the, origin, of, the, altar, stone, which, is, partially, buried, by, a, collapsed, sarsen, stone, as, having, come, from, the, orcadian, basin, in, northeast, scotland, some, 700, km, away, the, site, has, suffered, vandalism, intermittently, for, centuries, until, the, 17th, century, stones, disappeared, from, the, site, to, be, employed, at, building, sites, in, the, 19th, century, tourists, employed, chisels, to, cut, rock, chips, off, the, megaliths, as, souvenirs, although, the, first, years, of, the, free, festival, annual, from, 1975, onwards, saw, very, little, vandalism, stonehenge, had, to, be, fenced, off, from, 1978, onwards, later, repeated, vandalism, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, led, the, authorities, to, deploy, up, to, hundreds, of, police, erect, barriers, around, stonehenge, and, impose, exclusion, zones, up, to, six, kilometres, from, the, archaeological, monument, the, vandalism, of, 1984, included, defacing, the, monument, with, purple, spray, paint, the, government, went, so, far, as, to, close, stonehenge, to, protect, it, from, vandalism, but, in, the, face, of, public, outcry, the, government, opted, to, re, open, it, in, 2008, two, men, tore, a, small, slab, from, one, of, stonehenge, s, megaliths, in, what, authorities, described, as, the, first, vandalism, in, decades, in, 2020, the, british, transport, minister, was, accused, of, vandalism, when, he, decided, that, the, road, through, the, stonehenge, area, would, be, converted, into, a, tunnel, that, would, pass, in, the, immediate, vicinity, the, project, was, decades, old, but, had, always, been, delayed, because, of, its, cost, or, because, it, was, considered, archaeological, vandalism, the, historian, tom, holland, opined, that, to, inflict, this, act, of, vandalism, on, this, landscape, seems, unbelievable, tunnel, opponents, considered, it, state, sponsored, vandalism, even, as, their, case, was, defeated, in, court, in, 2024, on, 19, june, 2024, climate, protesters, from, just, stop, oil, vandalised, three, of, the, standing, stones, by, spraying, orange, cornflour, powder, paint, onto, them, wiltshire, police, arrested, student, niamh, lynch, from, oxford, and, rajan, naidu, from, birmingham, prime, minister, rishi, sunak, called, it, a, disgraceful, act, of, vandalism, to, one, of, the, uk, s, and, the, world, s, oldest, and, most, significant, monuments, and, called, on, anyone, associated, with, just, stop, oil, or, who, donated, to, them, to, condemn, the, act, leader, of, the, labour, party, sir, keir, starmer, called, the, vandalism, outrageous, while, deeming, just, stop, oil, as, pathetic, demanding, that, the, activists, and, anyone, else, involved, with, the, act, face, the, full, force, of, the, law, the, archaeologist, mike, pitts, said, the, impact, of, the, protest, was, potentially, quite, concerning, and, said, that, the, megaliths, were, fenced, off, and, guarded, to, protect, their, surfaces, which, were, entirely, covered, in, prehistoric, markings, that, have, not, been, fully, analysed, he, also, expressed, concern, about, possible, damage, to, the, diverse, lichen, patterns, on, the, megalith, surfaces, english, heritage, called, the, defacement, extremely, upsetting, and, began, an, investigation, to, assess, the, damage, caused, by, the, paint, before, removing, it, with, blown, air, and, reporting, that, there, was, no, visible, damage, to, the, stones, the, english, heritage, webpage, for, stonehenge, calls, for, visitors, to, respect, the, stones, since, they, form, a, world, heritage, site, a, scheduled, ancient, monument, and, a, place, sacred, to, many, conversely, sarah, kerr, a, lecturer, in, archaeology, at, university, college, cork, noted, that, the, effects, of, climate, change, pose, a, much, greater, threat, to, stonehenge, and, other, british, heritage, sites, than, just, stop, oil, s, protest, which, was, washed, away, without, causing, damage, historical, context, other, monuments, in, the, stonehenge, ritual, landscape, about, stonehenge, and, replicas, of,
