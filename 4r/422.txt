cats, and, song, and, dance, to, propose, a, new, musical, he, was, aiming, for, a, romantic, and, tragic, piece, and, suggested, gaston, leroux, s, book, the, phantom, of, the, opera, as, a, basis, they, screened, both, the, 1925, lon, chaney, and, the, 1943, claude, rains, motion, picture, versions, but, neither, saw, any, effective, way, to, make, the, leap, from, film, to, stage, later, in, new, york, lloyd, webber, found, a, second, hand, copy, of, the, original, long, out, of, print, leroux, novel, which, supplied, the, necessary, inspiration, to, develop, a, musical, said, lloyd, webber, i, was, actually, writing, something, else, at, the, time, and, i, realised, that, the, reason, i, was, hung, up, was, because, i, was, trying, to, write, a, major, romantic, story, and, i, had, been, trying, to, do, that, ever, since, i, started, my, career, then, with, the, phantom, it, was, there, lloyd, webber, first, approached, jim, steinman, to, write, the, lyrics, because, of, his, dark, obsessive, side, but, he, declined, in, order, to, fulfill, his, commitments, on, a, bonnie, tyler, album, alan, jay, lerner, 1918, 1986, was, then, recruited, but, he, became, seriously, ill, after, joining, the, project, and, was, forced, to, withdraw, none, of, his, contributions, mostly, involving, the, song, masquerade, are, credited, in, the, show, richard, stilgoe, the, lyricist, for, starlight, express, was, then, hired, and, wrote, most, of, the, original, lyrics, for, the, show, however, charles, hart, a, young, and, then, relatively, unknown, lyricist, later, rewrote, many, of, the, lyrics, along, with, original, lyrics, for, think, of, me, some, of, stilgoe, s, original, contributions, are, still, present, in, the, final, version, nevertheless, inspired, in, part, by, an, earlier, musical, version, of, the, same, story, by, ken, hill, lloyd, webber, s, score, is, sometimes, operatic, in, style, but, maintains, the, form, and, structure, of, a, musical, throughout, the, full, fledged, operatic, passages, are, reserved, principally, for, subsidiary, characters, such, as, andr, and, firmin, carlotta, and, piangi, they, are, also, used, to, provide, the, content, of, the, fictional, operas, that, are, taking, place, within, the, show, itself, viz, hannibal, il, muto, and, the, phantom, s, masterwork, don, juan, triumphant, here, lloyd, webber, pastiched, various, styles, from, the, grand, operas, of, meyerbeer, through, to, mozart, and, even, gilbert, and, sullivan, these, pieces, are, often, presented, as, musical, fragments, interrupted, by, dialogue, or, action, sequences, in, order, to, clearly, define, the, musical, s, show, within, a, show, format, the, musical, extracts, from, the, phantom, s, opera, don, juan, triumphant, heard, during, the, latter, stages, of, the, show, are, dissonant, and, modern, suggesting, perhaps, that, the, phantom, is, ahead, of, his, time, artistically, in, the, musical, s, title, song, the, signature, chromatic, five, note, descending, eighth, note, run, from, the, major, root, to, the, flat, 6th, below, is, directly, similar, to, a, riff, created, by, pink, floyd, for, the, track, echoes, on, their, 1971, album, meddle, something, noted, with, indignation, by, pink, floyd, s, roger, waters, in, a, 1992, interview, maria, bj, rnson, designed, the, sets, and, over, 200,
