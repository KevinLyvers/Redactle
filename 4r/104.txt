of, great, human, beings, were, essential, to, understanding, society, and, its, institutions, while, the, historical, impulse, would, remain, a, strong, element, in, early, american, biography, american, writers, carved, out, a, distinct, approach, what, emerged, was, a, rather, didactic, form, of, biography, which, sought, to, shape, the, individual, character, of, a, reader, in, the, process, of, defining, national, character, the, first, modern, biography, and, a, work, that, exerted, considerable, influence, on, the, evolution, of, the, genre, was, james, boswell, s, the, life, of, samuel, johnson, a, biography, of, lexicographer, and, man, of, letters, samuel, johnson, published, in, 1791, while, boswell, s, personal, acquaintance, with, his, subject, only, began, in, 1763, when, johnson, was, 54, years, old, boswell, covered, the, entirety, of, johnson, s, life, by, means, of, additional, research, itself, an, important, stage, in, the, development, of, the, modern, genre, of, biography, it, has, been, claimed, to, be, the, greatest, biography, written, in, the, english, language, boswell, s, work, was, unique, in, its, level, of, research, which, involved, archival, study, eye, witness, accounts, and, interviews, its, robust, and, attractive, narrative, and, its, honest, depiction, of, all, aspects, of, johnson, s, life, and, character, a, formula, which, serves, as, the, basis, of, biographical, literature, to, this, day, biographical, writing, generally, stagnated, during, the, 19th, century, in, many, cases, there, was, a, reversal, to, the, more, familiar, hagiographical, method, of, eulogizing, the, dead, similar, to, the, biographies, of, saints, produced, in, medieval, times, a, distinction, between, mass, biography, and, literary, biography, began, to, form, by, the, middle, of, the, century, reflecting, a, breach, between, high, culture, and, middle, class, culture, however, the, number, of, biographies, in, print, experienced, a, rapid, growth, thanks, to, an, expanding, reading, public, this, revolution, in, publishing, made, books, available, to, a, larger, audience, of, readers, in, addition, affordable, paperback, editions, of, popular, biographies, were, published, for, the, first, time, periodicals, began, publishing, a, sequence, of, biographical, sketches, autobiographies, became, more, popular, as, with, the, rise, of, education, and, cheap, printing, modern, concepts, of, fame, and, celebrity, began, to, develop, autobiographies, were, written, by, authors, such, as, charles, dickens, who, incorporated, autobiographical, elements, in, his, novels, and, anthony, trollope, his, autobiography, appeared, posthumously, quickly, becoming, a, bestseller, in, london, philosophers, such, as, john, stuart, mill, churchmen, john, henry, newman, and, entertainers, p, t, barnum, the, sciences, of, psychology, and, sociology, were, ascendant, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, and, would, heavily, influence, the, new, century, s, biographies, the, demise, of, the, great, man, theory, of, history, was, indicative, of, the, emerging, mindset, human, behavior, would, be, explained, through, darwinian, theories, sociological, biographies, conceived, of, their, subjects, actions, as, the, result, of, the, environment, and, tended, to, downplay, individuality, the, development, of, psychoanalysis, led, to, a, more, penetrating, and, comprehensive, understanding, of, the, biographical, subject, and, induced, biographers, to, give, more, emphasis, to, childhood, and, adolescence, clearly, these, psychological, ideas, were, changing, the, way, biographies, were, written, as, a, culture, of, autobiography, developed, in, which, the, telling, of, one, s, own, story, became, a, form, of, therapy, the, conventional, concept, of, heroes, and, narratives, of, success, disappeared, in, the, obsession, with, psychological, explorations, of, personality, british, critic, lytton, strachey, revolutionized, the, art, of, biographical, writing, with, his, 1918, work, eminent, victorians, consisting, of, biographies, of, four, leading, figures, from, the, victorian, era, cardinal, manning, florence, nightingale, thomas, arnold, and, general, gordon, strachey, set, out, to, breathe, life, into, the, victorian, era, for, future, generations, to, read, up, until, this, point, as, strachey, remarked, in, the, preface, victorian, biographies, had, been, as, familiar, as, the, cort, ge, of, the, undertaker, and, wore, the, same, air, of, slow, funereal, barbarism, strachey, defied, the, tradition, of, two, fat, volumes, of, undigested, masses, of, material, and, took, aim, at, the, four, iconic, figures, his, narrative, demolished, the, myths, that, had, built, up, around, these, cherished, national, heroes, whom, he, regarded, as, no, better, than, a, set, of, mouth, bungled, hypocrites, the, book, achieved, worldwide, fame, due, to, its, irreverent, and, witty, style, its, concise, and, factually, accurate, nature, and, its, artistic, prose, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, biographical, writers, sought, to, capitalize, on, strachey, s, popularity, by, imitating, his, style, this, new, school, featured, iconoclasts, scientific, analysts, and, fictional, biographers, and, included, gamaliel, bradford, andr, maurois, and, emil, ludwig, among, others, robert, graves, i, claudius, 1934, stood, out, among, those, following, strachey, s, model, of, debunking, biographies, the, trend, in, literary, biography, was, accompanied, in, popular, biography, by, a, sort, of, celebrity, voyeurism, in, the, early, decades, of, the, century, this, latter, form, s, appeal, to, readers, was, based, on, curiosity, more, than, morality, or, patriotism, by, world, war, i, cheap, hard, cover, reprints, had, become, popular, the, decades, of, the, 1920s, witnessed, a, biographical, boom, american, professional, historiography, gives, a, limited, role, to, biography, preferring, instead, to, emphasize, deeper, social, and, cultural, influences, political, biographers, historically, incorporated, moralizing, judgments, into, their, work, with, scholarly, biography, being, an, uncommon, genre, before, the, mid, 1920s, allan, nevins, was, a, major, contributor, in, the, 1930s, to, the, multivolume, dictionary, of, american, biography, nevins, also, sponsored, a, series, of, long, political, biographies, later, biographers, sought, to, show, how, political, figures, balanced, power, and, responsibility, however, many, biographers, found, that, their, subjects, were, not, as, morally, pure, as, they, originally, thought, and, young, historians, after, 1960, tended, to, be, more, critical, the, exception, is, robert, remini, whose, books, on, andrew, jackson, idolize, its, hero, and, fends, off, criticisms, the, study, of, decision, making, in, politics, is, important, for, scholarly, political, biographers, who, can, take, different, approaches, such, as, focusing, on, psychology, personality, bureaucracy, interests, fundamental, ideas, or, societal, forces, however, most, documentation, favors, the, first, approach, which, emphasizes, personalities, biographers, often, neglect, the, voting, blocs, and, legislative, positions, of, politicians, and, the, organizational, structures, of, bureaucracies, a, more, promising, approach, is, to, locate, a, person, s, ideas, through, intellectual, history, but, this, has, become, more, difficult, with, the, philosophical, shallowness, of, political, figures, in, recent, times, political, biography, can, be, frustrating, and, challenging, to, integrate, with, other, fields, of, political, history, the, feminist, scholar, carolyn, heilbrun, observed, that, women, s, biographies, and, autobiographies, began, to, change, character, during, the, second, wave, of, feminist, activism, she, cited, nancy, milford, s, 1970, biography, zelda, as, the, beginning, of, a, new, period, of, women, s, biography, because, in, 1970, were, we, ready, to, read, not, that, zelda, had, destroyed, fitzgerald, but, fitzgerald, her, he, had, usurped, her, narrative, heilbrun, named, 1973, as, the, turning, point, in, women, s, autobiography, with, the, publication, of, may, sarton, s, journal, of, a, solitude, for, that, was, the, first, instance, where, a, woman, told, her, life, story, not, as, finding, beauty, even, in, pain, and, transforming, rage, into, spiritual, acceptance, but, acknowledging, what, had, previously, been, forbidden, to, women, their, pain, their, rage, and, their, open, admission, of, the, desire, for, power, and, control, over, one, s, life, in, recent, years, multimedia, biography, has, become, more, popular, than, traditional, literary, forms, along, with, documentary, biographical, films, hollywood, produced, numerous, commercial, films, based, on, the, lives, of, famous, people, the, popularity, of, these, forms, of, biography, have, led, to, the, proliferation, of, tv, channels, dedicated, to, biography, including, a, e, the, biography, channel, and, the, history, channel, cd, rom, and, online, biographies, have, also, appeared, unlike, books, and, films, they, often, do, not, tell, a, chronological, narrative, instead, they, are, archives, of, many, discrete, media, elements, related, to, an, individual, person, including, video, clips, photographs, and, text, articles, biography, portraits, were, created, in, 2001, by, the, german, artist, ralph, ueltzhoeffer, media, scholar, lev, manovich, says, that, such, archives, exemplify, the, database, form, allowing, users, to, navigate, the, materials, in, many, ways, general, life, writing, techniques, are, a, subject, of, scholarly, study, in, recent, years, debates, have, arisen, as, to, whether, all, biographies, are, fiction, especially, when, authors, are, writing, about, figures, from, the, past, president, of, wolfson, college, at, oxford, university, hermione, lee, argues, that, all, history, is, seen, through, a, perspective, that, is, the, product, of, one, s, contemporary, society, and, as, a, result, biographical, truths, are, constantly, shifting, so, the, history, biographers, write, about, will, not, be, the, way, that, it, happened, it, will, be, the, way, they, remembered, it, debates, have, also, arisen, concerning, the, importance, of, space, in, life, writing, daniel, r, meister, in, 2017, argued, that, biographical, research, is, defined, by, miller, as, a, research, method, that, collects, and, analyses, a, person, s, whole, life, or, portion, of, a, life, through, the, in, depth, and, unstructured, interview, or, sometimes, reinforced, by, semi, structured, interview, or, personal, documents, it, is, a, way, of, viewing, social, life, in, procedural, terms, rather, than, static, terms, the, information, can, come, from, oral, history, personal, narrative, biography, and, autobiography, or, diaries, letters, memoranda, and, other, materials, the, central, aim, of, biographical, research, is, to, produce, rich, descriptions, of, persons, or, conceptualise, structural, types, of, actions, which, means, to, understand, the, action, logics, or, how, persons, and, structures, are, interlinked, this, method, can, be, used, to, understand, an, individual, s, life, within, its, social, context, or, understand, the, cultural, phenomena, there, are, many, largely, unacknowledged, pitfalls, to, writing, good, biographies, and, these, largely, concern, the, relation, between, firstly, the, individual, and, the, context, and, secondly, the, private, and, public, paul, james, writes, the, problems, with, such, conventional, biographies, are, manifold, biographies, usually, treat, the, public, as, a, reflection, of, the, private, with, the, private, realm, being, assumed, to, be, foundational, this, is, strange, given, that, biographies, are, most, often, written, about, public, people, who, project, a, persona, that, is, for, such, subjects, the, dominant, passages, of, the, presentation, of, themselves, in, everyday, life, are, already, formed, by, what, might, be, called, a, self, biofication, process, several, countries, offer, an, annual, prize, for, writing, a, biography, such, as, the
