an, electronic, musical, instrument, or, electrophone, is, a, musical, instrument, that, produces, sound, using, electronic, circuitry, such, an, instrument, sounds, by, outputting, an, electrical, electronic, or, digital, audio, signal, that, ultimately, is, plugged, into, a, power, amplifier, which, drives, a, loudspeaker, creating, the, sound, heard, by, the, performer, and, listener, an, electronic, instrument, might, include, a, user, interface, for, controlling, its, sound, often, by, adjusting, the, pitch, frequency, or, duration, of, each, note, a, common, user, interface, is, the, musical, keyboard, which, functions, similarly, to, the, keyboard, on, an, acoustic, piano, where, the, keys, are, each, linked, mechanically, to, swinging, string, hammers, whereas, with, an, electronic, keyboard, the, keyboard, interface, is, linked, to, a, synth, module, computer, or, other, electronic, or, digital, sound, generator, which, then, creates, a, sound, however, it, is, increasingly, common, to, separate, user, interface, and, sound, generating, functions, into, a, music, controller, input, device, and, a, music, synthesizer, respectively, with, the, two, devices, communicating, through, a, musical, performance, description, language, such, as, midi, or, open, sound, control, the, solid, state, nature, of, electronic, keyboards, also, offers, differing, feel, and, response, offering, a, novel, experience, in, playing, relative, to, operating, a, mechanically, linked, piano, keyboard, all, electronic, musical, instruments, can, be, viewed, as, a, subset, of, audio, signal, processing, applications, simple, electronic, musical, instruments, are, sometimes, called, sound, effects, the, border, between, sound, effects, and, actual, musical, instruments, is, often, unclear, in, the, 21st, century, electronic, musical, instruments, are, now, widely, used, in, most, styles, of, music, in, popular, music, styles, such, as, electronic, dance, music, almost, all, of, the, instrument, sounds, used, in, recordings, are, electronic, instruments, e, g, bass, synth, synthesizer, drum, machine, development, of, new, electronic, musical, instruments, controllers, and, synthesizers, continues, to, be, a, highly, active, and, interdisciplinary, field, of, research, specialized, conferences, such, as, the, international, conference, on, new, interfaces, for, musical, expression, have, organized, to, report, cutting, edge, work, as, well, as, to, provide, a, showcase, for, artists, who, perform, or, create, music, with, new, electronic, music, instruments, controllers, and, synthesizers, in, musicology, electronic, musical, instruments, are, known, as, electrophones, electrophones, are, the, fifth, category, of, musical, instrument, under, the, hornbostel, sachs, system, musicologists, typically, only, classify, music, as, electrophones, if, the, sound, is, initially, produced, by, electricity, excluding, electronically, controlled, acoustic, instruments, such, as, pipe, organs, and, amplified, instruments, such, as, electric, guitars, the, category, was, added, to, the, hornbostel, sachs, musical, instrument, classification, system, by, sachs, in, 1940, in, his, 1940, book, the, history, of, musical, instruments, the, original, 1914, version, of, the, system, did, not, include, it, sachs, divided, electrophones, into, three, subcategories, the, last, category, included, instruments, such, as, theremins, or, synthesizers, which, he, called, radioelectric, instruments, francis, william, galpin, provided, such, a, group, in, his, own, classification, system, which, is, closer, to, mahillon, than, sachs, hornbostel, for, example, in, galpin, s, 1937, book, a, textbook, of, european, musical, instruments, he, lists, electrophones, with, three, second, level, divisions, for, sound, generation, by, oscillation, electro, magnetic, and, electro, static, as, well, as, third, level, and, fourth, level, categories, based, on, the, control, method, present, day, ethnomusicologists, such, as, margaret, kartomi, and, terry, ellingson, suggest, that, in, keeping, with, the, spirit, of, the, original, hornbostel, sachs, classification, scheme, if, one, categorizes, instruments, by, what, first, produces, the, initial, sound, in, the, instrument, that, only, subcategory, 53, should, remain, in, the, electrophones, category, thus, it, has, been, more, recently, proposed, for, example, that, the, pipe, organ, even, if, it, uses, electric, key, action, to, control, solenoid, valves, remain, in, the, aerophones, category, and, that, the, electric, guitar, remain, in, the, chordophones, category, and, so, on, in, the, 18th, century, musicians, and, composers, adapted, a, number, of, acoustic, instruments, to, exploit, the, novelty, of, electricity, thus, in, the, broadest, sense, the, first, electrified, musical, instrument, was, the, denis, d, or, keyboard, dating, from, 1753, followed, shortly, by, the, clavecin, lectrique, by, the, frenchman, jean, baptiste, de, laborde, in, 1761, the, denis, d, or, consisted, of, a, keyboard, instrument, of, over, 700, strings, electrified, temporarily, to, enhance, sonic, qualities, the, clavecin, lectrique, was, a, keyboard, instrument, with, plectra, picks, activated, electrically, however, neither, instrument, used, electricity, as, a, sound, source, the, first, electric, synthesizer, was, invented, in, 1876, by, elisha, gray, the, musical, telegraph, was, a, chance, by, product, of, his, telephone, technology, when, gray, discovered, that, he, could, control, sound, from, a, self, vibrating, electromagnetic, circuit, and, so, invented, a, basic, oscillator, the, musical, telegraph, used, steel, reeds, oscillated, by, electromagnets, and, transmitted, over, a, telephone, line, gray, also, built, a, simple, loudspeaker, device, into, later, models, which, consisted, of, a, diaphragm, vibrating, in, a, magnetic, field, a, significant, invention, which, later, had, a, profound, effect, on, electronic, music, was, the, audion, in, 1906, this, was, the, first, thermionic, valve, or, vacuum, tube, and, which, led, to, the, generation, and, amplification, of, electrical, signals, radio, broadcasting, and, electronic, computation, among, other, things, other, early, synthesizers, included, the, telharmonium, 1897, the, theremin, 1919, j, rg, mager, s, spharophon, 1924, and, partiturophone, taubmann, s, similar, electronde, 1933, maurice, martenot, s, ondes, martenot, martenot, waves, 1928, trautwein, s, trautonium, 1930, the, mellertion, 1933, used, a, non, standard, scale, bertrand, s, dynaphone, could, produce, octaves, and, perfect, fifths, while, the, emicon, was, an, american, keyboard, controlled, instrument, constructed, in, 1930, and, the, german, hellertion, combined, four, instruments, to, produce, chords, three, russian, instruments, also, appeared, oubouhof, s, croix, sonore, 1934, ivor, darreg, s, microtonal, electronic, keyboard, oboe, 1937, and, the, ans, synthesizer, constructed, by, the, russian, scientist, evgeny, murzin, from, 1937, to, 1958, only, two, models, of, this, latter, were, built, and, the, only, surviving, example, is, currently, stored, at, the, lomonosov, university, in, moscow, it, has, been, used, in, many, russian, movies, like, solaris, to, produce, unusual, cosmic, sounds, hugh, le, caine, john, hanert, raymond, scott, composer, percy, grainger, with, burnett, cross, and, others, built, a, variety, of, automated, electronic, music, controllers, during, the, late, 1940s, and, 1950s, in, 1959, daphne, oram, produced, a, novel, method, of, synthesis, her, oramics, technique, driven, by, drawings, on, a, 35, mm, film, strip, it, was, used, for, a, number, of, years, at, the, bbc, radiophonic, workshop, this, workshop, was, also, responsible, for, the, theme, to, the, tv, series, doctor, who, a, piece, largely, created, by, delia, derbyshire, that, more, than, any, other, ensured, the, popularity, of, electronic, music, in, the, uk, in, 1897, thaddeus, cahill, patented, an, instrument, called, the, telharmonium, or, teleharmonium, also, known, as, the, dynamaphone, using, tonewheels, to, generate, musical, sounds, as, electrical, signals, by, additive, synthesis, it, was, capable, of, producing, any, combination, of, notes, and, overtones, at, any, dynamic, level, this, technology, was, later, used, to, design, the, hammond, organ, between, 1901, and, 1910, cahill, had, three, progressively, larger, and, more, complex, versions, made, the, first, weighing, seven, tons, the, last, in, excess, of, 200, tons, portability, was, managed, only, by, rail, and, with, the, use, of, thirty, boxcars, by, 1912, public, interest, had, waned, and, cahill, s, enterprise, was, bankrupt, another, development, which, aroused, the, interest, of, many, composers, occurred, in, 1919, 1920, in, leningrad, leon, theremin, built, and, demonstrated, his, etherophone, which, was, later, renamed, the, theremin, this, led, to, the, first, compositions, for, electronic, instruments, as, opposed, to, noisemakers, and, re, purposed, machines, the, theremin, was, notable, for, being, the, first, musical, instrument, played, without, touching, it, in, 1929, joseph, schillinger, composed, first, airphonic, suite, for, theremin, and, orchestra, premi, red, with, the, cleveland, orchestra, with, leon, theremin, as, soloist, the, next, year, henry, cowell, commissioned, theremin, to, create, the, first, electronic, rhythm, machine, called, the, rhythmicon, cowell, wrote, some, compositions, for, it, which, he, and, schillinger, premiered, in, 1932, the, ondes, martenot, is, played, with, a, keyboard, or, by, moving, a, ring, along, a, wire, creating, wavering, sounds, similar, to, a, theremin, it, was, invented, in, 1928, by, the, french, cellist, maurice, martenot, who, was, inspired, by, the, accidental, overlaps, of, tones, between, military, radio, oscillators, and, wanted, to, create, an, instrument, with, the, expressiveness, of, the, cello, the, french, composer, olivier, messiaen, used, the, ondes, martenot, in, pieces, such, as, his, 1949, symphony, turangal, la, symphonie, and, his, sister, in, law, jeanne, loriod, was, a, celebrated, player, it, appears, in, numerous, film, and, television, soundtracks, particularly, science, fiction, and, horror, films, contemporary, users, of, the, ondes, martenot, include, tom, waits, daft, punk, and, the, radiohead, guitarist, jonny, greenwood, the, trautonium, was, invented, in, 1928, it, was, based, on, the, subharmonic, scale, and, the, resulting, sounds, were, often, used, to, emulate, bell, or, gong, sounds, as, in, the, 1950s, bayreuth, productions, of, parsifal, in, 1942, richard, strauss, used, it, for, the, bell, and, gong, part, in, the, dresden, premi, re, of, his, japanese, festival, music, this, new, class, of, instruments, microtonal, by, nature, was, only, adopted, slowly, by, composers, at, first, but, by, the, early, 1930s, there, was, a, burst, of, new, works, incorporating, these, and, other, electronic, instruments, in, 1929, laurens, hammond, established, his, company, for, the, manufacture, of, electronic, instruments, he, went, on, to, produce, the, hammond, organ, which, was, based, on, the, principles, of, the, telharmonium, along, with, other, developments, including, early, reverberation, units, the, hammond, organ, is, an, electromechanical, instrument, as, it, used, both, mechanical, elements, and, electronic, parts, a, hammond, organ, used, spinning, metal, tonewheels, to, produce, different, sounds, a, magnetic, pickup, similar, in, design, to, the, pickups, in, an, electric, guitar, is, used, to, transmit, the, pitches, in, the, tonewheels, to, an, amplifier, and, speaker, enclosure, while, the, hammond, organ, was, designed, to, be, a, lower, cost, alternative, to, a, pipe, organ, for, church, music, musicians, soon, discovered, that, the, hammond, was, an, excellent, instrument, for, blues, and, jazz, indeed, an, entire, genre, of, music, developed, built, around, this, instrument, known, as, the, organ, trio, typically, hammond, organ, drums, and, a, third, instrument, either, saxophone, or, guitar, the, first, commercially, manufactured, synthesizer, was, the, novachord, built, by, the, hammond, organ, company, from, 1938, to, 1942, which, offered, 72, note, polyphony, using, 12, oscillators, driving, monostable, based, divide, down, circuits, basic, envelope, control, and, resonant, low, pass, filters, the, instrument, featured, 163, vacuum, tubes, and, weighed, 500, pounds, the, instrument, s, use, of, envelope, control, is, significant, since, this, is, perhaps, the, most, significant, distinction, between, the, modern, synthesizer, and, other, electronic, instruments, the, most, commonly, used, electronic, instruments, are, synthesizers, so, called, because, they, artificially, generate, sound, using, a, variety, of, techniques, all, early, circuit, based, synthesis, involved, the, use, of, analogue, circuitry, particularly, voltage, controlled, amplifiers, oscillators, and, filters, an, important, technological, development, was, the, invention, of, the, clavivox, synthesizer, in, 1956, by, raymond, scott, with, subassembly, by, robert, moog, french, composer, and, engineer, edgard, var, se, created, a, variety, of, compositions, using, electronic, horns, whistles, and, tape, most, notably, he, wrote, po, me, lectronique, for, the, philips, pavilion, at, the, brussels, world, fair, in, 1958, rca, produced, experimental, devices, to, synthesize, voice, and, music, in, the, 1950s, the, mark, ii, music, synthesizer, housed, at, the, columbia, princeton, electronic, music, center, in, new, york, city, designed, by, herbert, belar, and, harry, olson, at, rca, with, contributions, from, vladimir, ussachevsky, and, peter, mauzey, it, was, installed, at, columbia, university, in, 1957, consisting, of, a, room, sized, array, of, interconnected, sound, synthesis, components, it, was, only, capable, of, producing, music, by, programming, using, a, paper, tape, sequencer, punched, with, holes, to, control, pitch, sources, and, filters, similar, to, a, mechanical, player, piano, but, capable, of, generating, a, wide, variety, of, sounds, the, vacuum, tube, system, had, to, be, patched, to, create, timbres, in, the, 1960s, synthesizers, were, still, usually, confined, to, studios, due, to, their, size, they, were, usually, modular, in, design, their, stand, alone, signal, sources, and, processors, connected, with, patch, cords, or, by, other, means, and, controlled, by, a, common, controlling, device, harald, bode, don, buchla, hugh, le, caine, raymond, scott, and, paul, ketoff, were, among, the, first, to, build, such, instruments, in, the, late, 1950s, and, early, 1960s, buchla, later, produced, a, commercial, modular, synthesizer, the, buchla, music, easel, robert, moog, who, had, been, a, student, of, peter, mauzey, and, one, of, the, rca, mark, ii, engineers, created, a, synthesizer, that, could, reasonably, be, used, by, musicians, designing, the, circuits, while, he, was, at, columbia, princeton, the, moog, synthesizer, was, first, displayed, at, the, audio, engineering, society, convention, in, 1964, it, required, experience, to, set, up, sounds, but, was, smaller, and, more, intuitive, than, what, had, come, before, less, like, a, machine, and, more, like, a, musical, instrument, moog, established, standards, for, control, interfacing, using, a, logarithmic, 1, volt, per, octave, for, pitch, control, and, a, separate, triggering, signal, this, standardization, allowed, synthesizers, from, different, manufacturers, to, operate, simultaneously, pitch, control, was, usually, performed, either, with, an, organ, style, keyboard, or, a, music, sequencer, producing, a, timed, series, of, control, voltages, during, the, late, 1960s, hundreds, of, popular, recordings, used, moog, synthesizers, other, early, commercial, synthesizer, manufacturers, included, arp, who, also, started, with, modular, synthesizers, before, producing, all, in, one, instruments, and, british, firm, ems, in, 1970, moog, designed, the, minimoog, a, non, modular, synthesizer, with, a, built, in, keyboard, the, analogue, circuits, were, interconnected, with, switches, in, a, simplified, arrangement, called, normalization, though, less, flexible, than, a, modular, design, normalization, made, the, instrument, more, portable, and, easier, to, use, the, minimoog, sold, 12, 000, units, further, standardized, the, design, of, subsequent, synthesizers, with, its, integrated, keyboard, pitch, and, modulation, wheels, and, vco, vcf, vca, signal, flow, it, has, become, celebrated, for, its, fat, sound, and, its, tuning, problems, miniaturized, solid, state, components, allowed, synthesizers, to, become, self, contained, portable, instruments, that, soon, appeared, in, live, performance, and, quickly, became, widely, used, in, popular, music, and, electronic, art, music, many, early, analog, synthesizers, were, monophonic, producing, only, one, tone, at, a, time, popular, monophonic, synthesizers, include, the, moog, minimoog, a, few, such, as, the, moog, sonic, six, arp, odyssey, and, eml, 101, could, produce, two, different, pitches, at, a, time, when, two, keys, were, pressed, polyphony, multiple, simultaneous, tones, which, enables, chords, was, only, obtainable, with, electronic, organ, designs, at, first, popular, electronic, keyboards, combining, organ, circuits, with, synthesizer, processing, included, the, arp, omni, and, moog, s, polymoog, and, opus, 3, by, 1976, affordable, polyphonic, synthesizers, began, to, appear, such, as, the, yamaha, cs, 50, cs, 60, and, cs, 80, the, sequential, circuits, prophet, 5, and, the, oberheim, four, voice, these, remained, complex, heavy, and, relatively, costly, the, recording, of, settings, in, digital, memory, allowed, storage, and, recall, of, sounds, the, first, practical, polyphonic, synth, and, the, first, to, use, a, microprocessor, as, a, controller, was, the, sequential, circuits, prophet, 5, introduced, in, late, 1977, for, the, first, time, musicians, had, a, practical, polyphonic, synthesizer, that, could, save, all, knob, settings, in, computer, memory, and, recall, them, at, the, touch, of, a, button, the, prophet, 5, s, design, paradigm, became, a, new, standard, slowly, pushing, out, more, complex, and, recondite, modular, designs, in, 1935, another, significant, development, was, made, in, germany, allgemeine, elektricit, ts, gesellschaft, aeg, demonstrated, the, first, commercially, produced, magnetic, tape, recorder, called, the, magnetophon, audio, tape, which, had, the, advantage, of, being, fairly, light, as, well, as, having, good, audio, fidelity, ultimately, replaced, the, bulkier, wire, recorders, the, term, electronic, music, which, first, came, into, use, during, the, 1930s, came, to, include, the, tape, recorder, as, an, essential, element, electronically, produced, sounds, recorded, on, tape, and, arranged, by, the, composer, to, form, a, musical, composition, it, was, also, indispensable, to, musique, concr, te, tape, also, gave, rise, to, the, first, analogue, sample, playback, keyboards, the, chamberlin, and, its, more, famous, successor, the, mellotron, an, electro, mechanical, polyphonic, keyboard, originally, developed, and, built, in, birmingham, england, in, the, early, 1960s, during, the, 1940s, 1960s, raymond, scott, an, american, composer, of, electronic, music, invented, various, kind, of, music, sequencers, for, his, electric, compositions, step, sequencers, played, rigid, patterns, of, notes, using, a, grid, of, usually, 16, buttons, or, steps, each, step, being, 1, 16, of, a, measure, these, patterns, of, notes, were, then, chained, together, to, form, longer, compositions, software, sequencers, were, continuously, utilized, since, the, 1950s, in, the, context, of, computer, music, including, computer, played, music, software, sequencer, computer, composed, music, music, synthesis, and, computer, sound, generation, sound, synthesis, the, first, digital, synthesizers, were, academic, experiments, in, sound, synthesis, using, digital, computers, fm, synthesis, was, developed, for, this, purpose, as, a, way, of, generating, complex, sounds, digitally, with, the, smallest, number, of, computational, operations, per, sound, sample, in, 1983, yamaha, introduced, the, first, stand, alone, digital, synthesizer, the, dx, 7, it, used, frequency, modulation, synthesis, fm, synthesis, first, developed, by, john, chowning, at, stanford, university, during, the, late, sixties, chowning, exclusively, licensed, his, fm, synthesis, patent, to, yamaha, in, 1975, yamaha, subsequently, released, their, first, fm, synthesizers, the, gs, 1, and, gs, 2, which, were, costly, and, heavy, there, followed, a, pair, of, smaller, preset, versions, the, ce20, and, ce25, combo, ensembles, targeted, primarily, at, the, home, organ, market, and, featuring, four, octave, keyboards, yamaha, s, third, generation, of, digital, synthesizers, was, a, commercial, success, it, consisted, of, the, dx7, and, dx9, 1983, both, models, were, compact, reasonably, priced, and, dependent, on, custom, digital, integrated, circuits, to, produce, fm, tonalities, the, dx7, was, the, first, mass, market, all, digital, synthesizer, it, became, indispensable, to, many, music, artists, of, the, 1980s, and, demand, soon, exceeded, supply, the, dx7, sold, over, 200, 000, units, within, three, years, the, dx, series, was, not, easy, to, program, but, offered, a, detailed, percussive, sound, that, led, to, the, demise, of, the, electro, mechanical, rhodes, piano, which, was, heavier, and, larger, than, a, dx, synth, following, the, success, of, fm, synthesis, yamaha, signed, a, contract, with, stanford, university, in, 1989, to, develop, digital, waveguide, synthesis, leading, to, the, first, commercial, physical, modeling, synthesizer, yamaha, s, vl, 1, in, 1994, the, dx, 7, was, affordable, enough, for, amateurs, and, young, bands, to, buy, unlike, the, costly, synthesizers, of, previous, generations, which, were, mainly, used, by, top, professionals, the, fairlight, cmi, computer, musical, instrument, the, first, polyphonic, digital, sampler, was, the, harbinger, of, sample, based, synthesizers, designed, in, 1978, by, peter, vogel, and, kim, ryrie, and, based, on, a, dual, microprocessor, computer, designed, by, tony, furse, in, sydney, australia, the, fairlight, cmi, gave, musicians, the, ability, to, modify, volume, attack, decay, and, use, special, effects, like, vibrato, sample, waveforms, could, be, displayed, on, screen, and, modified, using, a, light, pen, the, synclavier, from, new, england, digital, was, a, similar, system, jon, appleton, with, jones, and, alonso, invented, the, dartmouth, digital, synthesizer, later, to, become, the, new, england, digital, corp, s, synclavier, the, kurzweil, k250, first, produced, in, 1983, was, also, a, successful, polyphonic, digital, music, synthesizer, noted, for, its, ability, to, reproduce, several, instruments, synchronously, and, having, a, velocity, sensitive, keyboard, an, important, new, development, was, the, advent, of, computers, for, the, purpose, of, composing, music, as, opposed, to, manipulating, or, creating, sounds, iannis, xenakis, began, what, is, called, musique, stochastique, or, stochastic, music, which, is, a, method, of, composing, that, employs, mathematical, probability, systems, different, probability, algorithms, were, used, to, create, a, piece, under, a, set, of, parameters, xenakis, used, graph, paper, and, a, ruler, to, aid, in, calculating, the, velocity, trajectories, of, glissando, for, his, orchestral, composition, metastasis, 1953, 54, but, later, turned, to, the, use, of, computers, to, compose, pieces, like, st, 4, for, string, quartet, and, st, 48, for, orchestra, both, 1962, the, impact, of, computers, continued, in, 1956, lejaren, hiller, and, leonard, issacson, composed, illiac, suite, for, string, quartet, the, first, complete, work, of, computer, assisted, composition, using, algorithmic, composition, in, 1957, max, mathews, at, bell, lab, wrote, music, n, series, a, first, computer, program, family, for, generating, digital, audio, waveforms, through, direct, synthesis, then, barry, vercoe, wrote, music, 11, based, on, music, iv, bf, a, next, generation, music, synthesis, program, later, evolving, into, csound, which, is, still, widely, used, in, mid, 80s, miller, puckette, at, ircam, developed, graphic, signal, processing, software, for, 4x, called, max, after, max, mathews, and, later, ported, it, to, macintosh, with, dave, zicarelli, extending, it, for, opcode, for, real, time, midi, control, bringing, algorithmic, composition, availability, to, most, composers, with, modest, computer, programming, background, in, 1980, a, group, of, musicians, and, music, merchants, met, to, standardize, an, interface, by, which, new, instruments, could, communicate, control, instructions, with, other, instruments, and, the, prevalent, microcomputer, this, standard, was, dubbed, midi, musical, instrument, digital, interface, a, paper, was, authored, by, dave, smith, of, sequential, circuits, and, proposed, to, the, audio, engineering, society, in, 1981, then, in, august, 1983, the, midi, specification, 1, 0, was, finalized, the, advent, of, midi, technology, allows, a, single, keystroke, control, wheel, motion, pedal, movement, or, command, from, a, microcomputer, to, activate, every, device, in, the, studio, remotely, and, in, synchrony, with, each, device, responding, according, to, conditions, predetermined, by, the, composer, midi, instruments, and, software, made, powerful, control, of, sophisticated, instruments, easily, affordable, by, many, studios, and, individuals, acoustic, sounds, became, reintegrated, into, studios, via, sampling, and, sampled, rom, based, instruments, the, increasing, power, and, decreasing, cost, of, sound, generating, electronics, and, especially, of, the, personal, computer, combined, with, the, standardization, of, the, midi, and, open, sound, control, musical, performance, description, languages, has, facilitated, the, separation, of, musical, instruments, into, music, controllers, and, music, synthesizers, by, far, the, most, common, musical, controller, is, the, musical, keyboard, other, controllers, include, the, radiodrum, akai, s, ewi, and, yamaha, s, wx, wind, controllers, the, guitar, like, synthaxe, the, bodysynth, the, buchla, thunder, the, continuum, fingerboard, the, roland, octapad, various, isomorphic, keyboards, including, the, thummer, and, kaossilator, pro, and, kits, like, i, cubex, the, reactable, is, a, round, translucent, table, with, a, backlit, interactive, display, by, placing, and, manipulating, blocks, called, tangibles, on, the, table, surface, while, interacting, with, the, visual, display, via, finger, gestures, a, virtual, modular, synthesizer, is, operated, creating, music, or, sound, effects, audiocubes, are, autonomous, wireless, cubes, powered, by, an, internal, computer, system, and, rechargeable, battery, they, have, internal, rgb, lighting, and, are, capable, of, detecting, each, other, s, location, orientation, and, distance, the, cubes, can, also, detect, distances, to, the, user, s, hands, and, fingers, through, interaction, with, the, cubes, a, variety, of, music, and, sound, software, can, be, operated, audiocubes, have, applications, in, sound, design, music, production, djing, and, live, performance, the, kaossilator, and, kaossilator, pro, are, compact, instruments, where, the, position, of, a, finger, on, the, touch, pad, controls, two, note, characteristics, usually, the, pitch, is, changed, with, a, left, right, motion, and, the, tonal, property, filter, or, other, parameter, changes, with, an, up, down, motion, the, touch, pad, can, be, set, to, different, musical, scales, and, keys, the, instrument, can, record, a, repeating, loop, of, adjustable, length, set, to, any, tempo, and, new, loops, of, sound, can, be, layered, on, top, of, existing, ones, this, lends, itself, to, electronic, dance, music, but, is, more, limited, for, controlled, sequences, of, notes, as, the, pad, on, a, regular, kaossilator, is, featureless, the, eigenharp, is, a, large, instrument, resembling, a, bassoon, which, can, be, interacted, with, through, big, buttons, a, drum, sequencer, and, a, mouthpiece, the, sound, processing, is, done, on, a, separate, computer, the, alphasphere, is, a, spherical, instrument, that, consists, of, 48, tactile, pads, that, respond, to, pressure, as, well, as, touch, custom, software, allows, the, pads, to, be, indefinitely, programmed, individually, or, by, groups, in, terms, of, function, note, and, pressure, parameter, among, many, other, settings, the, primary, concept, of, the, alphasphere, is, to, increase, the, level, of, expression, available, to, electronic, musicians, by, allowing, for, the, playing, style, of, a, musical, instrument, chiptune, chipmusic, or, chip, music, is, music, written, in, sound, formats, where, many, of, the, sound, textures, are, synthesized, or, sequenced, in, real, time, by, a, computer, or, video, game, console, sound, chip, sometimes, including, sample, based, synthesis, and, low, bit, sample, playback, many, chip, music, devices, featured, synthesizers, in, tandem, with, low, rate, sample, playback, during, the, late, 1970s, and, early, 1980s, do, it, yourself, designs, were, published, in, hobby, electronics, magazines, such, the, formant, modular, synth, a, diy, clone, of, the, moog, system, published, by, elektor, and, kits, were, supplied, by, companies, such, as, paia, in, the, us, and, maplin, electronics, in, the, uk, in, 1966, reed, ghazala, discovered, and, began, to, teach, math, circuit, bending, the, application, of, the, creative, short, circuit, a, process, of, chance, short, circuiting, creating, experimental, electronic, instruments, exploring, sonic, elements, mainly, of, timbre, and, with, less, regard, to, pitch, or, rhythm, and, influenced, by, john, cage, s, aleatoric, music, concept, much, of, this, manipulation, of, circuits, directly, especially, to, the, point, of, destruction, was, pioneered, by, louis, and, bebe, barron, in, the, early, 1950s, such, as, their, work, with, john, cage, on, the, williams, mix, and, especially, in, the, soundtrack, to, forbidden, planet, modern, circuit, bending, is, the, creative, customization, of, the, circuits, within, electronic, devices, such, as, low, voltage, battery, powered, guitar, effects, children, s, toys, and, small, digital, synthesizers, to, create, new, musical, or, visual, instruments, and, sound, generators, emphasizing, spontaneity, and, randomness, the, techniques, of, circuit, bending, have, been, commonly, associated, with, noise, music, though, many, more, conventional, contemporary, musicians, and, musical, groups, have, been, known, to, experiment, with, bent, instruments, circuit, bending, usually, involves, dismantling, the, machine, and, adding, components, such, as, switches, and, potentiometers, that, alter, the, circuit, with, the, revived, interest, for, analogue, synthesizer, circuit, bending, became, a, cheap, solution, for, many, experimental, musicians, to, create, their, own, individual, analogue, sound, generators, nowadays, many, schematics, can, be, found, to, build, noise, generators, such, as, the, atari, punk, console, or, the, dub, siren, as, well, as, simple, modifications, for, children, toys, such, as, the, speak, spell, that, are, often, modified, by, circuit, benders, the, modular, synthesizer, is, a, type, of, synthesizer, consisting, of, separate, interchangeable, modules, these, are, also, available, as, kits, for, hobbyist, diy, constructors, many, hobbyist, designers, also, make, available, bare, pcb, boards, and, front, panels, for, sale, to, other, hobbyists, technologies, instrument, families, individual, instruments, historical, individual, instruments, modern, in, indian, and, asian, traditional, music
