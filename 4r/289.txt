paradise, lost, is, an, epic, poem, in, blank, verse, by, the, 17th, century, english, poet, john, milton, 1608, 1674, the, first, version, published, in, 1667, consists, of, ten, books, with, over, ten, thousand, lines, of, verse, a, second, edition, followed, in, 1674, arranged, into, twelve, books, in, the, manner, of, virgil, s, aeneid, with, minor, revisions, throughout, it, is, considered, to, be, milton, s, masterpiece, and, it, helped, solidify, his, reputation, as, one, of, the, greatest, english, poets, of, all, time, the, poem, concerns, the, biblical, story, of, the, fall, of, man, the, temptation, of, adam, and, eve, by, the, fallen, angel, satan, and, their, expulsion, from, the, garden, of, eden, the, poem, follows, the, epic, tradition, of, starting, in, medias, res, lit, in, the, midst, of, things, the, background, story, being, recounted, later, milton, s, story, has, two, narrative, arcs, one, about, satan, lucifer, and, the, other, about, adam, and, eve, it, begins, after, satan, and, the, other, fallen, angels, have, been, defeated, and, banished, to, hell, or, as, it, is, also, called, in, the, poem, tartarus, in, pand, monium, the, capital, city, of, hell, satan, employs, his, rhetorical, skill, to, organise, his, followers, he, is, aided, by, mammon, and, beelzebub, belial, chemosh, and, moloch, are, also, present, at, the, end, of, the, debate, satan, volunteers, to, corrupt, the, newly, created, earth, and, god, s, new, and, most, favoured, creation, mankind, he, braves, the, dangers, of, the, abyss, alone, in, a, manner, reminiscent, of, odysseus, or, aeneas, after, an, arduous, traversal, of, the, chaos, outside, hell, he, enters, god, s, new, material, world, and, later, the, garden, of, eden, at, several, points, in, the, poem, an, angelic, war, over, heaven, is, recounted, from, different, perspectives, satan, s, rebellion, follows, the, epic, convention, of, large, scale, warfare, the, battles, between, the, faithful, angels, and, satan, s, forces, take, place, over, three, days, at, the, final, battle, the, son, of, god, single, handedly, defeats, the, entire, legion, of, angelic, rebels, and, banishes, them, from, heaven, following, this, purge, god, creates, the, world, culminating, in, his, creation, of, adam, and, eve, while, god, gave, adam, and, eve, total, freedom, and, power, to, rule, over, all, creation, he, gave, them, one, explicit, command, not, to, eat, from, the, tree, of, the, knowledge, of, good, and, evil, on, penalty, of, death, adam, and, eve, are, presented, as, having, a, romantic, and, sexual, relationship, while, still, being, without, sin, they, have, passions, and, distinct, personalities, satan, disguised, in, the, form, of, a, serpent, successfully, tempts, eve, to, eat, from, the, tree, by, preying, on, her, vanity, and, tricking, her, with, rhetoric, adam, learning, that, eve, has, sinned, knowingly, commits, the, same, sin, he, declares, to, eve, that, since, she, was, made, from, his, flesh, they, are, bound, to, one, another, if, she, dies, he, must, also, die, in, this, manner, milton, portrays, adam, as, a, heroic, figure, but, also, as, a, greater, sinner, than, eve, as, he, is, aware, that, what, he, is, doing, is, wrong, after, eating, the, fruit, adam, and, eve, experience, lust, for, the, first, time, which, renders, their, next, sexual, encounter, with, one, another, unpleasant, at, first, adam, is, convinced, that, eve, was, right, in, thinking, that, eating, the, fruit, would, be, beneficial, however, they, soon, fall, asleep, and, have, terrible, nightmares, and, after, they, awake, they, experience, guilt, and, shame, for, the, first, time, realising, that, they, have, committed, a, terrible, act, against, god, they, engage, in, mutual, recrimination, meanwhile, satan, returns, triumphantly, to, hell, amid, the, praise, of, his, fellow, fallen, angels, he, tells, them, about, how, their, scheme, worked, and, mankind, has, fallen, giving, them, complete, dominion, over, paradise, as, he, finishes, his, speech, however, the, fallen, angels, around, him, become, hideous, snakes, and, soon, enough, satan, himself, turns, into, a, snake, deprived, of, limbs, and, unable, to, talk, thus, they, share, the, same, punishment, as, they, shared, the, same, guilt, eve, appeals, to, adam, for, reconciliation, of, their, actions, her, encouragement, enables, them, to, approach, god, and, plead, for, forgiveness, in, a, vision, shown, to, him, by, the, archangel, michael, adam, witnesses, everything, that, will, happen, to, mankind, until, the, great, flood, adam, is, very, upset, by, this, vision, of, the, future, so, michael, also, tells, him, about, mankind, s, potential, redemption, from, original, sin, through, jesus, christ, whom, michael, calls, king, messiah, adam, and, eve, are, cast, out, of, eden, and, michael, says, that, adam, may, find, a, paradise, within, thee, happier, far, adam, and, eve, now, have, a, more, distant, relationship, with, god, who, is, omnipresent, but, invisible, unlike, the, tangible, father, in, the, garden, of, eden, it, is, uncertain, when, milton, composed, paradise, lost, john, aubrey, 1626, 1697, milton, s, contemporary, and, biographer, says, that, it, was, written, between, 1658, and, 1663, however, parts, of, the, poem, had, likely, been, in, development, since, milton, was, young, having, gone, blind, in, 1652, milton, wrote, paradise, lost, entirely, through, dictation, with, the, help, of, amanuenses, and, friends, he, was, often, ill, suffering, from, gout, and, suffering, emotionally, after, the, early, death, of, his, second, wife, katherine, woodcock, in, 1658, and, their, infant, daughter, the, image, of, milton, dictating, the, poem, to, his, daughters, became, a, popular, subject, for, paintings, especially, in, the, romantic, period, the, milton, scholar, john, leonard, also, notes, that, milton, did, not, at, first, plan, to, write, a, biblical, epic, since, epics, were, typically, written, about, heroic, kings, and, queens, and, with, pagan, gods, milton, originally, envisioned, his, epic, to, be, based, on, a, legendary, saxon, or, british, king, like, the, legend, of, king, arthur, leonard, speculates, that, the, english, civil, war, interrupted, milton, s, earliest, attempts, to, start, his, epic, that, would, encompass, all, space, and, time, in, the, 1667, version, of, paradise, lost, the, poem, was, divided, into, ten, books, however, in, the, 1674, edition, the, text, was, reorganized, into, twelve, books, in, later, printing, arguments, brief, summaries, were, inserted, at, the, beginning, of, each, book, milton, s, previous, work, had, been, printed, by, matthew, simmons, who, was, favoured, by, radical, writers, however, he, died, in, 1654, and, the, business, was, then, run, by, mary, simmons, milton, had, not, published, work, with, the, simmons, printing, business, for, twenty, years, mary, was, increasingly, relying, on, her, son, samuel, to, help, her, manage, the, business, and, the, first, book, that, samuel, simmons, registered, for, publication, in, his, name, was, paradise, lost, in, 1667, key, to, the, ambitions, of, paradise, lost, as, a, poem, is, the, creation, of, a, new, kind, of, epic, one, suitable, for, english, christian, morality, rather, than, polytheistic, greek, or, roman, antiquity, this, intention, is, indicated, from, the, very, beginning, of, the, poem, when, milton, uses, the, classical, epic, poetic, device, of, an, invocation, for, poetic, inspiration, rather, than, invoking, the, classical, muses, however, milton, addresses, the, christian, god, as, his, heav, nly, muse, 1, 1, other, classical, epic, conventions, include, an, in, medias, res, opening, a, journey, in, the, underworld, large, scale, battles, and, an, elevated, poetic, style, in, particular, the, poem, often, uses, homeric, similes, milton, repurposes, these, epic, conventions, to, create, a, new, biblical, epic, promoting, a, different, kind, of, hero, classical, epic, heroes, like, achilles, odysseus, and, aeneas, were, presented, in, the, iliad, odyssey, and, aeneid, as, heroes, for, their, military, strength, and, guile, which, might, go, hand, in, hand, with, wrath, pride, or, lust, milton, attributes, these, traits, instead, to, satan, and, depicts, the, son, as, heroic, for, his, love, mercy, humility, and, self, sacrifice, the, poem, itself, therefore, presents, the, value, system, of, classical, heroism, as, one, which, has, been, superseded, by, christian, virtue, the, poem, is, written, in, blank, verse, meaning, the, lines, are, metrically, regular, iambic, pentameter, but, they, do, not, rhyme, milton, used, the, flexibility, of, blank, verse, to, support, a, high, level, of, syntactic, complexity, although, milton, was, not, the, first, to, use, blank, verse, his, use, of, it, was, very, influential, and, he, became, known, for, the, style, blank, verse, was, not, much, used, in, the, non, dramatic, poetry, of, the, 17th, century, until, paradise, lost, milton, also, wrote, paradise, regained, 1671, and, parts, of, samson, agonistes, 1671, in, blank, verse, miltonic, blank, verse, became, the, standard, for, those, attempting, to, write, english, epics, for, centuries, following, the, publication, of, paradise, lost, and, his, later, poetry, when, miltonic, verse, became, popular, samuel, johnson, mocked, milton, for, inspiring, bad, blank, verse, imitators, alexander, pope, s, final, incomplete, work, was, intended, to, be, written, in, the, form, and, john, keats, who, complained, that, he, relied, too, heavily, on, milton, adopted, and, picked, up, various, aspects, of, his, poetry, milton, used, a, number, of, acrostics, in, the, poem, in, book, 9, a, verse, describing, the, serpent, which, tempted, eve, to, eat, the, forbidden, fruit, in, the, garden, of, eden, spells, out, satan, 9, 510, while, elsewhere, in, the, same, book, milton, spells, out, ffaall, and, fall, 9, 333, respectively, these, probably, represent, the, double, fall, of, humanity, embodied, in, adam, and, eve, as, well, as, satan, s, fall, from, heaven, satan, formerly, called, lucifer, is, the, first, major, character, introduced, in, the, poem, he, is, a, tragic, figure, who, famously, declares, better, to, reign, in, hell, than, serve, in, heaven, 1, 263, following, his, vain, rebellion, against, god, he, is, cast, out, from, heaven, and, condemned, to, hell, the, rebellion, stems, from, satan, s, pride, and, envy, 5, 660ff, opinions, on, the, character, are, often, sharply, divided, milton, presents, satan, as, the, origin, of, all, evil, but, some, readers, have, struggled, with, accepting, this, interpretation, romanticist, critics, in, particular, among, them, william, blake, lord, byron, percy, bysshe, shelley, and, william, hazlitt, are, known, for, interpreting, satan, as, a, hero, of, paradise, lost, this, has, led, other, critics, such, as, c, s, lewis, and, charles, williams, both, of, whom, were, devout, christians, to, argue, against, reading, satan, as, a, sympathetic, heroic, figure, despite, blake, thinking, that, milton, intended, for, satan, to, have, a, heroic, role, in, the, poem, blake, himself, described, satan, as, the, state, of, error, and, as, beyond, salvation, john, carey, argues, that, this, conflict, cannot, be, solved, because, the, character, of, satan, exists, in, more, modes, and, greater, depth, than, the, other, characters, of, paradise, lost, in, this, way, milton, has, created, an, ambivalent, character, and, any, pro, satan, or, anti, satan, argument, is, by, its, nature, discarding, half, the, evidence, satan, s, ambivalence, carey, says, is, a, precondition, of, the, poem, s, success, a, major, factor, in, the, attention, it, has, aroused, however, in, lewis, s, book, a, preface, to, paradise, lost, he, notes, that, it, is, important, to, remember, what, society, was, like, when, milton, wrote, the, poem, in, particular, during, that, time, period, there, were, certain, stock, responses, to, elements, that, milton, would, have, expected, every, reader, to, have, as, examples, lewis, lists, love, is, sweet, death, bitter, virtue, lovely, and, children, or, gardens, delightful, milton, would, have, expected, readers, to, not, view, satan, as, a, hero, at, all, lewis, says, readers, far, in, the, future, romanticizing, milton, s, intentions, is, not, accurate, because, the, first, qualification, for, judging, any, piece, of, workmanship, from, a, corkscrew, to, a, cathedral, is, to, know, what, it, is, what, it, was, intended, to, do, and, how, it, is, meant, to, be, used, after, that, has, been, discovered, the, temperance, reformer, may, decide, that, the, corkscrew, was, made, for, a, bad, purpose, and, the, communist, may, think, the, same, about, the, cathedral, but, such, questions, come, later, the, first, thing, is, to, understand, the, object, before, you, as, long, as, you, think, the, corkscrew, was, meant, for, opening, tins, or, the, cathedral, for, entertaining, tourists, you, can, say, nothing, to, the, purpose, about, them, lewis, goes, on, to, note, that, regarding, paradise, lost, the, first, thing, we, need, know, is, what, milton, meant, it, to, be, a, need, which, he, argues, is, specially, urgent, in, the, present, age, because, the, kind, of, poem, milton, meant, to, write, is, unfamiliar, to, many, readers, later, in, the, book, lewis, details, the, character, of, satan, in, paradise, lost, and, why, he, was, not, someone, milton, would, have, considered, a, hero, or, someone, to, take, pleasure, in, adam, is, the, first, human, created, by, god, adam, requests, a, companion, from, god, of, fellowship, i, speak, such, as, i, seek, fit, to, participate, all, rational, delight, wherein, the, brute, cannot, be, human, consort, 8, 389, 392, god, approves, his, request, then, creates, eve, god, appoints, adam, and, eve, to, rule, over, all, the, creatures, of, the, world, and, to, reside, in, the, garden, of, eden, adam, is, more, gregarious, than, eve, and, yearns, for, her, company, he, is, completely, infatuated, with, her, raphael, advises, him, to, take, heed, lest, passion, sway, thy, judgment, 5, 635, 636, but, adam, s, great, love, for, eve, contributes, to, his, disobedience, to, god, unlike, the, biblical, adam, before, milton, s, adam, leaves, paradise, he, is, given, a, glimpse, of, the, future, of, mankind, by, the, archangel, michael, which, includes, stories, from, the, old, and, new, testaments, eve, is, the, second, human, created, by, god, god, takes, one, of, adam, s, ribs, and, shapes, it, into, eve, whether, eve, is, actually, inferior, to, adam, is, a, vexed, point, she, is, often, unwilling, to, be, submissive, eve, may, be, the, more, intelligent, of, the, two, when, she, first, met, adam, she, turned, away, more, interested, in, herself, she, had, been, looking, at, her, reflection, in, a, lake, before, being, led, invisibly, to, adam, recounting, this, to, adam, she, confesses, that, she, found, him, less, enticing, than, her, reflection, 4, 477, 480, eve, delivers, an, autobiography, in, book, 4, in, book, 9, milton, stages, a, domestic, drama, between, adam, and, eve, which, results, in, eve, convincing, adam, to, separate, for, a, time, to, work, in, different, parts, of, the, garden, this, allows, satan, to, deceive, her, while, she, is, alone, to, tempt, her, to, eat, the, forbidden, fruit, satan, tells, a, story, about, how, he, ate, it, using, the, language, of, renaissance, love, poetry, he, overcomes, her, reason, she, eats, the, fruit, the, son, of, god, is, the, spirit, who, will, become, incarnate, as, jesus, christ, though, he, is, never, named, explicitly, because, he, has, not, yet, entered, human, form, milton, believed, in, a, subordinationist, doctrine, of, christology, that, regarded, the, son, as, secondary, to, the, father, and, as, god, s, great, vice, regent, 5, 609, milton, s, god, in, paradise, lost, refers, to, the, son, as, my, word, my, wisdom, and, effectual, might, 3, 170, the, poem, is, not, explicitly, anti, trinitarian, but, it, is, consistent, with, milton, s, convictions, the, son, is, the, ultimate, hero, of, the, epic, and, is, infinitely, powerful, he, single, handedly, defeats, satan, and, his, followers, and, drives, them, into, hell, after, their, fall, the, son, of, god, tells, adam, and, eve, about, god, s, judgment, before, their, fall, the, father, foretells, their, treason, 3, 207, and, that, man, with, his, whole, posteritie, must, dye, dye, hee, or, justice, must, unless, for, him, som, other, able, and, as, willing, pay, the, rigid, satisfaction, death, for, death, 3, 210, 212, the, father, then, asks, whether, there, dwels, in, all, heaven, charitie, so, deare, 3, 216, and, the, son, volunteers, himself, in, the, final, book, a, vision, of, salvation, through, the, son, is, revealed, to, adam, by, michael, the, name, jesus, of, nazareth, and, the, details, of, jesus, story, are, not, depicted, in, the, poem, though, they, are, alluded, to, michael, explains, that, joshua, whom, the, gentiles, jesus, call, prefigures, the, son, of, god, his, name, and, office, bearing, to, quell, the, adversarie, serpent, and, bring, back, long, wander, d, man, safe, to, eternal, paradise, of, rest, god, the, father, is, the, creator, of, heaven, hell, the, world, of, everyone, and, everything, there, is, through, the, agency, of, his, son, milton, presents, god, as, all, powerful, and, all, knowing, as, an, infinitely, great, being, who, cannot, be, overthrown, by, even, the, great, army, of, angels, satan, incites, against, him, milton, portrays, god, as, often, conversing, about, his, plans, and, his, motives, for, his, actions, with, the, son, of, god, the, poem, shows, god, creating, the, world, in, the, way, milton, believed, it, was, done, that, is, god, created, heaven, earth, hell, and, all, the, creatures, that, inhabit, these, separate, planes, from, part, of, himself, not, out, of, nothing, thus, according, to, milton, the, ultimate, authority, of, god, over, all, things, that, happen, derives, from, his, being, the, author, of, all, creation, satan, tries, to, justify, his, rebellion, by, denying, this, aspect, of, god, and, claiming, self, creation, but, he, admits, to, himself, the, truth, otherwise, and, that, god, deserved, no, such, return, from, me, whom, he, created, what, i, was, raphael, is, an, archangel, who, is, sent, by, god, to, eden, in, order, to, strengthen, adam, and, eve, against, satan, he, tells, a, heroic, tale, about, the, war, in, heaven, that, takes, up, most, of, book, 6, of, paradise, lost, ultimately, the, story, told, by, raphael, in, which, satan, is, portrayed, as, bold, and, decisive, does, not, prepare, adam, and, eve, to, counter, satan, s, subtle, temptations, and, may, even, have, caused, the, fall, in, the, first, place, michael, is, an, archangel, who, is, preeminent, in, military, prowess, he, leads, in, battle, and, uses, a, sword, which, was, giv, n, him, temperd, so, that, neither, keen, nor, solid, might, resist, that, edge, 6, 322, 323, god, sends, michael, to, eden, charging, him, from, the, paradise, of, god, without, remorse, drive, out, the, sinful, pair, from, hallowd, ground, th, unholie, and, denounce, to, them, and, to, thir, progenie, from, thence, perpetual, banishment, if, patiently, thy, bidding, they, obey, dismiss, them, not, disconsolate, reveale, to, adam, what, shall, come, in, future, dayes, as, i, shall, thee, enlighten, intermix, my, cov, nant, in, the, womans, seed, renewd, so, send, them, forth, though, sorrowing, yet, in, peace, 11, 103, 117, he, is, also, charged, with, establishing, a, guard, for, paradise, when, adam, sees, him, coming, he, describes, him, to, eve, as, not, terrible, that, i, should, fear, nor, sociably, mild, as, raphael, that, i, should, much, confide, but, solemn, and, sublime, whom, not, to, offend, with, reverence, i, must, meet, and, thou, retire, 11, 233, 237, milton, first, presented, adam, and, eve, in, book, iv, with, impartiality, the, relationship, between, adam, and, eve, is, one, of, mutual, dependence, not, a, relation, of, domination, or, hierarchy, while, the, author, placed, adam, above, eve, in, his, intellectual, knowledge, and, in, turn, his, relation, to, god, he, granted, eve, the, benefit, of, knowledge, through, experience, hermine, van, nuis, clarifies, that, although, there, was, stringency, specified, for, the, roles, of, male, and, female, adam, and, eve, unreservedly, accept, their, designated, roles, rather, than, viewing, these, roles, as, forced, upon, them, each, uses, their, assignment, as, an, asset, in, their, relationship, with, each, other, these, distinctions, can, be, interpreted, as, milton, s, view, on, the, importance, of, mutuality, between, husband, and, wife, when, examining, the, relationship, between, adam, and, eve, some, critics, apply, either, an, adam, centered, or, eve, centered, view, of, hierarchy, and, importance, to, god, david, mikics, argues, by, contrast, these, positions, overstate, the, independence, of, the, characters, stances, and, therefore, miss, the, way, in, which, adam, and, eve, are, entwined, with, each, other, milton, s, narrative, depicts, a, relationship, where, the, husband, and, wife, here, adam, and, eve, depend, on, each, other, and, through, each, other, s, differences, thrive, still, there, are, several, instances, where, adam, communicates, directly, with, god, while, eve, must, go, through, adam, to, god, thus, some, have, described, adam, as, her, guide, although, milton, does, not, directly, mention, divorce, critics, posit, theories, on, milton, s, view, of, divorce, based, upon, their, inferences, from, the, poem, and, from, his, tracts, on, divorce, written, earlier, in, his, life, other, works, by, milton, suggest, he, viewed, marriage, as, an, entity, separate, from, the, church, discussing, paradise, lost, biberman, entertains, the, idea, that, marriage, is, a, contract, made, by, both, the, man, and, the, woman, these, ideas, imply, milton, may, have, favored, that, both, man, and, woman, have, equal, access, to, marriage, and, to, divorce, milton, s, 17th, century, contemporaries, by, and, large, criticised, his, ideas, and, considered, him, a, radical, mostly, because, of, his, republican, political, views, and, heterodox, theological, opinions, one, of, milton, s, most, controversial, arguments, centred, on, his, concept, of, what, is, idolatrous, a, subject, which, is, deeply, embedded, in, paradise, lost, milton, s, first, criticism, of, idolatry, focused, on, the, constructing, of, temples, and, other, buildings, to, serve, as, places, of, worship, in, book, xi, of, paradise, lost, adam, tries, to, atone, for, his, sins, by, offering, to, build, altars, to, worship, god, in, response, the, angel, michael, explains, that, adam, does, not, need, to, build, physical, objects, to, experience, the, presence, of, god, joseph, lyle, points, to, this, example, explaining, when, milton, objects, to, architecture, it, is, not, a, quality, inherent, in, buildings, themselves, he, finds, offensive, but, rather, their, tendency, to, act, as, convenient, loci, to, which, idolatry, over, time, will, inevitably, adhere, even, if, the, idea, is, pure, in, nature, milton, thought, it, would, unavoidably, lead, to, idolatry, simply, because, of, the, nature, of, humans, that, is, instead, of, directing, their, thoughts, towards, god, humans, will, turn, to, erected, objects, and, falsely, invest, their, faith, there, while, adam, attempts, to, build, an, altar, to, god, critics, note, eve, is, similarly, guilty, of, idolatry, but, in, a, different, manner, harding, believes, eve, s, narcissism, and, obsession, with, herself, constitutes, idolatry, specifically, harding, claims, that, under, the, serpent, s, influence, eve, s, idolatry, and, self, deification, foreshadow, the, errors, into, which, her, sons, will, stray, much, like, adam, eve, falsely, places, her, faith, in, herself, the, tree, of, knowledge, and, to, some, extent, the, serpent, all, of, which, do, not, compare, to, the, ideal, nature, of, god, milton, made, his, views, on, idolatry, more, explicit, with, the, creation, of, pand, monium, and, his, allusion, to, solomon, s, temple, in, the, beginning, of, paradise, lost, and, throughout, the, poem, there, are, several, references, to, the, rise, and, eventual, fall, of, solomon, s, temple, critics, elucidate, that, solomon, s, temple, provides, an, explicit, demonstration, of, how, an, artefact, moves, from, its, genesis, in, devotional, practice, to, an, idolatrous, end, this, example, out, of, the, many, presented, distinctly, conveys, milton, s, views, on, the, dangers, of, idolatry, even, if, one, builds, a, structure, in, the, name, of, god, the, best, of, intentions, can, become, immoral, in, idolatry, the, majority, of, these, similarities, revolve, around, a, structural, likeness, but, as, lyle, explains, they, play, a, greater, role, by, linking, saint, peter, s, basilica, and, the, pantheon, to, pandemonium, an, ideally, false, structure, the, two, famous, buildings, take, on, a, false, meaning, this, comparison, best, represents, milton, s, protestant, views, as, it, rejects, both, the, purely, catholic, perspective, and, the, pagan, perspective, in, addition, to, rejecting, catholicism, milton, revolted, against, the, idea, of, a, monarch, ruling, by, divine, right, he, saw, the, practice, as, idolatrous, barbara, lewalski, concludes, that, the, theme, of, idolatry, in, paradise, lost, is, an, exaggerated, version, of, the, idolatry, milton, had, long, associated, with, the, stuart, ideology, of, divine, kingship, in, the, opinion, of, milton, any, object, human, or, non, human, that, receives, special, attention, befitting, of, god, is, considered, idolatrous, although, satan, s, army, inevitably, loses, the, war, against, god, satan, achieves, a, position, of, power, and, begins, his, reign, in, hell, with, his, band, of, loyal, followers, composed, of, fallen, angels, which, is, described, to, be, a, third, of, heaven, similar, to, milton, s, republican, sentiments, of, overthrowing, the, king, of, england, for, both, better, representation, and, parliamentary, power, satan, argues, that, his, shared, rebellion, with, the, fallen, angels, is, an, effort, to, explain, the, hypocrisy, of, god, and, in, doing, so, they, will, be, treated, with, the, respect, and, acknowledgement, that, they, deserve, as, wayne, rebhorn, argues, satan, insists, that, he, and, his, fellow, revolutionaries, held, their, places, by, right, and, even, leading, him, to, claim, that, they, were, self, created, and, self, sustained, and, thus, satan, s, position, in, the, rebellion, is, much, like, that, of, his, own, real, world, creator, milton, scholar, john, leonard, interpreted, the, impious, war, between, heaven, and, hell, as, civil, war, paradise, lost, is, among, other, things, a, poem, about, civil, war, satan, raises, impious, war, in, heav, n, i, 43, by, leading, a, third, of, the, angels, in, revolt, against, god, the, term, impious, war, implies, that, civil, war, is, impious, but, milton, applauded, the, english, people, for, having, the, courage, to, depose, and, execute, king, charles, i, in, his, poem, however, he, takes, the, side, of, heav, n, s, awful, monarch, iv, 960, critics, have, long, wrestled, with, the, question, of, why, an, antimonarchist, and, defender, of, regicide, should, have, chosen, a, subject, that, obliged, him, to, defend, monarchical, authority, the, editors, at, the, poetry, foundation, argue, that, milton, s, criticism, of, the, english, monarchy, was, being, directed, specifically, at, the, stuart, monarchy, and, not, at, the, monarchical, system, of, govenment, in, general, in, a, similar, vein, c, s, lewis, argued, that, there, was, no, contradiction, in, milton, s, position, in, the, poem, since, milton, believed, that, god, was, his, natural, superior, and, that, charles, stuart, was, not, the, critic, william, empson, claimed, the, poem, was, morally, ambiguous, with, milton, s, complex, characterization, of, satan, playing, a, large, part, in, empson, s, claim, of, moral, ambiguity, for, context, the, second, volume, of, empson, s, authorized, biography, was, titled, william, empson, against, the, christians, in, it, his, authorized, biographer, describes, empson, s, visceral, loathing, of, christianity, he, spent, a, large, amount, of, his, career, attacking, christianity, demonizing, it, as, wickedness, and, claiming, that, milton, s, god, was, sickeningly, bad, for, example, empson, portrays, milton, s, god, as, akin, to, a, stalinist, tyrant, who, enslaves, his, human, creations, to, serve, his, own, narcissism, from, there, empson, gives, fake, praise, that, is, really, an, attack, saying, that, milton, deserves, credit, for, making, god, wicked, since, the, god, of, christianity, is, a, wicked, god, john, leonard, states, that, empson, never, denies, that, satan, s, plan, is, wicked, what, he, does, deny, is, that, god, is, innocent, of, its, wickedness, milton, steadily, drives, home, that, the, inmost, counsel, of, god, was, the, fortunate, fall, of, man, however, wicked, satan, s, plan, may, be, it, is, god, s, plan, too, leonard, notes, that, this, interpretation, was, challenged, by, dennis, danielson, in, his, book, milton, s, good, god, 1982, alexandra, kapelos, peters, explains, that, as, danielson, logically, asserts, foreknowledge, is, not, commensurate, with, culpability, although, god, knew, that, adam, and, eve, would, eat, the, forbidden, fruit, of, knowledge, he, neither, commanded, them, to, do, so, nor, influenced, their, decision, moreover, god, gives, humans, free, will, to, choose, to, do, good, or, evil, while, a, tyrant, would, do, the, very, opposite, and, deny, free, will, by, controlling, his, subjects, actions, like, a, puppet, master, she, says, danielson, and, milton, demonstrate, one, crucial, point, the, presence, of, sin, in, the, world, is, attributable, to, human, agency, and, free, will, danielson, argues, that, free, will, is, crucial, because, without, it, humanity, would, have, only, been, serving, necessity, and, not, participating, in, a, free, love, act, with, the, divine, she, notes, that, in, paradise, lost, god, says, they, trespass, authors, to, themselves, in, all, both, what, they, judge, and, what, they, choose, for, so, i, formd, them, free, and, free, they, must, remain, kapelos, peters, adds, milton, demonstrates, that, far, from, being, a, tyrannical, lord, god, and, the, son, function, as, a, collaborative, team, that, desire, nothing, but, the, return, of, man, to, his, pre, fallen, state, furthermore, god, is, not, even, able, to, dominate, in, this, aspect, because, human, agency, and, free, will, are, not, abandoned, not, only, will, the, son, sacrifice, himself, pre, emptively, in, book, 3, for, the, not, yet, occurred, fall, of, man, but, man, himself, will, have, a, role, in, his, own, salvation, to, successfully, navigate, atonement, humanity, will, have, to, admit, and, repent, of, their, former, disobedience, c, s, lewis, also, rebutted, the, approach, of, people, like, empson, super, imposing, their, own, interpretations, with, an, agenda, onto, the, poem, long, after, it, was, written, lewis, wrote, the, first, qualification, for, judging, any, piece, of, workmanship, from, a, corkscrew, to, a, cathedral, is, to, know, what, it, is, what, it, was, intended, to, do, and, how, it, is, meant, to, be, used, lewis, said, the, poem, was, a, genuine, christian, morality, tale, in, lewis, s, book, a, preface, to, paradise, lost, he, discusses, the, theological, similarities, between, paradise, lost, and, st, augustine, and, says, that, the, fall, is, simply, and, solely, disobedience, doing, what, you, have, been, told, not, to, do, and, it, results, from, pride, from, being, too, big, for, your, boots, forgetting, your, place, thinking, that, you, are, god, the, writer, and, critic, samuel, johnson, wrote, that, paradise, lost, shows, off, milton, s, peculiar, power, to, astonish, and, that, milton, seems, to, have, been, well, acquainted, with, his, own, genius, and, to, know, what, it, was, that, nature, had, bestowed, upon, him, more, bountifully, than, upon, others, the, power, of, displaying, the, vast, illuminating, the, splendid, enforcing, the, awful, darkening, the, gloomy, and, aggravating, the, dreadful, william, blake, famously, wrote, in, the, marriage, of, heaven, and, hell, the, reason, milton, wrote, in, fetters, when, he, wrote, of, angels, god, and, at, liberty, when, of, devils, hell, is, because, he, was, a, true, poet, and, of, the, devil, s, party, without, knowing, it, this, quotation, succinctly, represents, the, way, in, which, some, 18th, and, 19th, century, english, romantic, poets, viewed, milton, tobias, gregory, wrote, that, milton, was, the, most, theologically, learned, among, early, modern, epic, poets, he, was, moreover, a, theologian, of, great, independence, of, mind, and, one, who, developed, his, talents, within, a, society, where, the, problem, of, divine, justice, was, debated, with, particular, intensity, gregory, says, that, milton, is, able, to, establish, divine, action, and, his, divine, characters, in, a, superior, way, to, other, renaissance, epic, poets, including, ludovico, ariosto, or, torquato, tasso, in, paradise, lost, milton, also, ignores, the, traditional, epic, format, of, a, plot, based, on, a, mortal, conflict, between, opposing, armies, with, deities, watching, over, and, occasionally, interfering, with, the, action, instead, both, divinity, and, humanity, are, involved, in, a, conflict, that, while, momentarily, ending, in, tragedy, offers, a, future, salvation, in, both, paradise, lost, and, paradise, regained, milton, incorporates, aspects, of, lucan, s, epic, model, the, epic, from, the, view, of, the, defeated, although, he, does, not, accept, the, model, completely, within, paradise, regained, he, incorporates, the, anti, virgilian, anti, imperial, epic, tradition, of, lucan, milton, goes, further, than, lucan, in, this, belief, and, paradise, lost, and, paradise, regained, carry, further, too, the, movement, toward, and, valorization, of, romance, that, lucan, s, tradition, had, begun, to, the, point, where, milton, s, poems, effectively, create, their, own, new, genre, the, church, reacted, by, banning, the, poem, and, placing, it, on, the, index, librorum, prohibitorum, the, first, illustrations, to, accompany, the, text, of, paradise, lost, were, added, to, the, fourth, edition, of, 1688, with, one, engraving, prefacing, each, book, of, which, up, to, eight, of, the, twelve, were, by, sir, john, baptist, medina, one, by, bernard, lens, ii, and, perhaps, up, to, four, including, books, i, and, xii, perhaps, the, most, memorable, by, another, hand, the, engraver, was, michael, burghers, given, as, burgesse, in, some, sources, by, 1730, the, same, images, had, been, re, engraved, on, a, smaller, scale, by, paul, fourdrinier, some, of, the, most, notable, illustrators, of, paradise, lost, included, william, blake, gustave, dor, and, henry, fuseli, however, the, epic, s, illustrators, also, include, john, martin, edward, francis, burney, richard, westall, francis, hayman, and, many, others, outside, of, book, illustrations, the, epic, has, also, inspired, other, visual, works, by, well, known, painters, like, salvador, dal, who, executed, a, set, of, ten, colour, engravings, in, 1974, milton, s, achievement, in, writing, paradise, lost, while, blind, he, dictated, to, helpers, inspired, loosely, biographical, paintings, by, both, fuseli, and, eug, ne, delacroix
