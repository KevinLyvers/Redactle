to, music, and, every, dance, would, have, had, a, piece, of, music, associated, with, it, the, most, important, set, of, music, of, the, period, was, the, six, dynasty, music, dance, performed, in, rituals, in, the, royal, court, music, in, the, zhou, dynasty, was, conceived, as, a, cosmological, manifestation, of, the, sound, of, nature, integrated, into, the, binary, universal, order, of, yin, and, yang, and, this, concept, has, had, an, enduring, influence, over, later, chinese, thinking, on, music, correct, music, according, to, zhou, concept, would, involve, instruments, correlating, to, the, five, elements, of, nature, and, would, bring, harmony, to, nature, around, or, before, the, 7th, century, bc, a, system, of, pitch, generation, and, pentatonic, scale, was, derived, from, a,

individual, and, the, confucian, system, considers, the, formal, music, yayue, to, be, morally, uplifting, and, the, symbol, of, a, good, ruler, and, stable, government, some, popular, forms, of, music, however, were, considered, corrupting, in, the, confucian, view, mozi, on, the, other, hand, condemned, making, music, and, argued, in, against, music, that, music, is, an, extravagance, and, indulgence, that, serves, no, useful, purpose, and, may, be, harmful, according, to, mencius, a, powerful, ruler, once, asked, him, whether, it, was, moral, if, he, preferred, popular, music, to, the, classics, the, answer, was, that, it, only, mattered, that, the, ruler, loved, his, subjects, in, ancient, china, the, social, status, of, musicians, was, much, lower, than, that, of, painters, though, music, was, seen, as, central, to, the, harmony, and, longevity, of, the, state, almost, every, emperor, took, folk, songs, seriously, sending, officers, to, collect, songs, to, record, the, popular, culture, one, of, the, confucianist, classics, the, classic, of, poetry, contained, many, folk, songs, dating, from, 800, bc, to, about, 400, bc, the, imperial, music, bureau, first,

determining, what, folk, music, would, be, officially, recognized, in, subsequent, dynasties, the, development, of, chinese, music, was, influenced, by, the, musical, traditions, of, central, asia, which, also, introduced, elements, of, indian, music, instruments, of, central, asian, origin, such, as, pipa, were, adopted, in, china, the, indian, heptatonic, scale, was, introduced, in, the, 6th, century, by, a, musician, from, kucha, named, sujiva, although, the, heptatonic, scale, was, later, abandoned, the, oldest, extant, written, chinese, music, is, youlan, or, the, solitary, orchid,

tang, dynasty, 618, 907ad, though, the, qin, is, known, to, have, been, played, since, before, the, han, dynasty, this, is, based, on, the, conjecture, that, because, the, recorded, examples, of, chinese, music, are, ceremonial, and, the, ceremonies, in, which, they, were, employed, are, thought, to, have, existed, perhaps, more, than, one, thousand, years, before, christ, the, musical, compositions, themselves, were, performed, even, in, 1000, bc, in, precisely, the, manner, prescribed, by, the, sources, that, were, written, down, in, the, seventh, century, ad, it, is, based, on,

as, part, of, the, new, culture, movement, much, of, what, westerners, and, even, chinese, now, consider, to, be, music, in, the, traditional, chinese, style, can, be, dated, to, this, period, and, is, in, fact, less, than, 100, years, old, the, modernization, of, chinese, music, involved, the, adoption, of, some, aspects, of, western, forms, and, values, such, as, the, use, of, western, conservatory, system, of, teaching, and, changes, to, the, instruments, and, their, tuning, the, composition, the, orchestration, of, music, the, notation, system, and, performance, style, some, forms, of, chinese, music, however, remained, traditional, and, are, little, changed, the, term, guoyue, or, national, music, became, popular, in, the, early, 20th, century, and, was, used, loosely, to, include, all, music, written, for, chinese, instruments, in, response, to, a, particular, nationalistic, consciousness, the, term, however, may, have, a, slightly, different, meaning, when, used, by, different, chinese, communities, it, was, originally, used, only, to, refer, to, the, music, of, the, han, chinese, it, later, began, to, include, music, of, various, ethnic, minorities, in, china, in, the, republic, of, china, in, taiwan, guoyue, emphasized, music, of, the, mainland, china, over, the, taiwanese, local, traditions, in, mainland, china, a, new, term, minyue, short, for, minzu, yinyue, or, people, s, music, was, coined, post, 1949, in, place, of, guoyue, to, encompass, all, compositions, and, genres, for, traditional, instruments, in, other, chinese, communities, it, may, also, be, referred, to, as, huayue, for, example, in, singapore, or, zhongyue, in, hong, kong, there, was, a, tradition, of, massed, instruments, in, the, ritual, court, music, form, known, as, yayue, since, the, zhou, dynasty, this, music, may, be, played, by, a, handful, of, musicians, or, there, may, be, more, than, 200, for, example, during, the, song, dynasty, during, the, tang, dynasty, there, were, also, large, scale, presentations, of, banquet, music, called, yanyue, in, the, court, the, tang, imperial, court, may, have, up, to, ten, different, orchestras, each, performing, a, different, kind, of, music, it, also, had, a, large, outdoor, band, of, nearly, 1, 400, performers, the, modern, chinese, orchestra, however, was, created, in, the, 20th, century, modeled, on, western, symphony, orchestra, using, chinese, instruments, in, the, traditional, yanyue, a, single, dominant, melodic, line, was, favored, but, the, new, music, and, arrangements, of, traditional, melodies, created, for, this, modern, orchestra, is, more, polyphonic, in, nature, many, traditional, instruments, underwent, changes, in, the, early, to, mid, 20th, century, which, has, a, profound, effect, on, the, performance, and, sound, of, chinese, music, and, a, western, equal, temperament, is, now, used, to, tune, most, traditional, instruments, which, to, modern, ears, seem, less, harsh, and, more, harmonious, but, which, also, robs, the, instruments, of, their, traditional, voices, to, ears, now, used, to, hearing, modern, tunings, even, chinese, ones, traditional, tunings, can, sound, out, of, tune, and, discordant, in, order, to, accommodate, western, system, changes, were, made, to, the, instruments, for, example, in, the, pipa, the, number, of, frets, was, increased, to, 24, based, on, the, 12, tone, equal, temperament, scale, with, all, the, intervals, being, semitones, there, is, also, a, need, to, standardize, the, tuning, when, the, instruments, are, played, in, an, orchestra, which, in, turn, may, also, affect, how, the, instrument, is, made, for, example, traditionally, dizi, is, made, by, using, a, solid, piece, of, bamboo, which, made, it, impossible, to, change, the, fundamental, tuning, once, the, bamboo, is, cut, this, issue, was, resolved, in, the, 1920s, by, the, insertion, of, a, copper, joint, to, connect, two, pieces, of, shorter, bamboo, which, allows, the, length, of, the, bamboo, to, be, modified, so, that, minute, adjustment, to, its, fundamental, pitch, can, be, made, the, xindi, new, flute, is, a, 1930s, redesign, of, the, chinese, flute, incorporating, western, influences, on, the, basis, of, equal, temperament, in, order, to, achieve, a, greater, vibrancy, and, loudness, with, instruments, not, to, mention, longevity, many, string, instruments, are, no, longer, strung, with, silk, but, with, steel, or, nylon, for, example, metal, strings, began, to, be, used, in, place, of, the, traditional, silk, ones, in, the, 1950s, for, pipa, resulting, in, a, change, in, the, sound, of, the, pipa, which, became, brighter, and, stronger, before, the, 20th, century, chinese, used, the, gongche, notation, system, in, modern, times, the, jianpu, system, is, common, western, staff, notation, however, is, also, used, in, common, with, the, music, traditions, of, other, asian, cultures, such, as, persia, and, india, one, strand, of, traditional, chinese, music, consists, of, a, repertoire, of, traditional, melodies, together, known, as, qupai, in, which, tempo, and, ornamentation, vary, according, to, the, mood, of, the, instrumentalist, the, audience, and, their, reaction, to, what, is, being, played, the, same, melody, can, be, used, to, serve, many, different, roles, be, it, merry, melancholic, or, martial, this, can, be, glimpsed, in, the, love, theme, of, the, butterfly, lovers, violin, concerto, where, the, same, melody, at, different, points, in, the, lover, s, story, reflects, elation, turbulence, and, dejection, many, modern, performers, now, play, pieces, by, following, a, score, in, a, standard, way, rather, than, in, the, changeable, reflective, individual, way, of, tradition, this, can, at, times, lead, to, the, feeling, that, a, performance, has, been, rushed, chinese, popular, music, found, its, beginnings, in, the, shidaiqu, genre, the, shidaiqu, genre, was, founded, by, li, jinhui, in, mainland, china, and, was, influenced, by, western, jazz, artists, like, buck, clayton, after, the, chinese, communist, revolution, popular, music, were,
