a, wind, instrument, is, a, musical, instrument, that, contains, some, type, of, resonator, usually, a, tube, in, which, a, column, of, air, is, set, into, vibration, by, the, player, blowing, into, or, over, a, mouthpiece, set, at, or, near, the, end, of, the, resonator, the, pitch, of, the, vibration, is, determined, by, the, length, of, the, tube, and, by, manual, modifications, of, the, effective, length, of, the, vibrating, column, of, air, in, the, case, of, some, wind, instruments, sound, is, produced, by, blowing, through, a, reed, others, require, buzzing, into, a, metal, mouthpiece, while, yet, others, require, the, player, to, blow, into, a, hole, at, an, edge, which, splits, the, air, column, and, creates, the, sound, almost, all, wind, instruments, use, the, last, method, often, in, combination, with, one, of, the, others, to, extend, their, register, wind, instruments, are, typically, grouped, into, two, families, woodwind, instruments, were, originally, made, of, wood, just, as, brass, instruments, were, made, of, brass, but, instruments, are, categorized, based, on, how, the, sound, is, produced, not, by, the, material, used, to, construct, them, for, example, saxophones, are, typically, made, of, brass, but, are, woodwind, instruments, because, they, produce, sound, with, a, vibrating, reed, on, the, other, hand, the, didgeridoo, the, wooden, cornett, not, to, be, confused, with, the, cornet, and, the, serpent, are, all, made, of, wood, or, sometimes, plastic, and, the, olifant, is, made, from, ivory, but, all, of, them, belong, to, the, family, of, brass, instruments, because, the, vibration, is, initiated, by, the, player, s, lips, in, the, hornbostel, sachs, scheme, of, musical, instrument, classification, wind, instruments, are, classed, as, aerophones, sound, production, in, all, wind, instruments, depends, on, the, entry, of, air, into, a, flow, control, valve, attached, to, a, resonant, chamber, resonator, the, resonator, is, typically, a, long, cylindrical, or, conical, tube, open, at, the, far, end, a, pulse, of, high, pressure, from, the, valve, will, travel, down, the, tube, at, the, speed, of, sound, it, will, be, reflected, from, the, open, end, as, a, return, pulse, of, low, pressure, under, suitable, conditions, the, valve, will, reflect, the, pulse, back, with, increased, energy, until, a, standing, wave, forms, in, the, tube, reed, instruments, such, as, the, clarinet, or, oboe, have, a, flexible, reed, or, reeds, at, the, mouthpiece, forming, a, pressure, controlled, valve, an, increase, in, pressure, inside, the, chamber, will, decrease, the, pressure, differential, across, the, reed, the, reed, will, open, more, increasing, the, flow, of, air, the, increased, flow, of, air, will, increase, the, internal, pressure, further, so, a, pulse, of, high, pressure, arriving, at, the, mouthpiece, will, reflect, as, a, higher, pressure, pulse, back, down, the, tube, standing, waves, inside, the, tube, will, be, odd, multiples, of, a, quarter, wavelength, with, a, pressure, anti, node, at, the, mouthpiece, and, a, pressure, node, at, the, open, end, the, reed, vibrates, at, a, rate, determined, by, the, resonator, for, lip, reed, brass, instruments, the, players, control, the, tension, in, their, lips, so, that, they, vibrate, under, the, influence, of, the, air, flowing, through, them, they, adjust, the, vibration, so, that, the, lips, are, most, closed, and, the, air, flow, is, lowest, when, a, low, pressure, pulse, arrives, at, the, mouthpiece, to, reflect, a, low, pressure, pulse, back, down, the, tube, standing, waves, inside, the, tube, will, be, odd, multiples, of, a, quarter, wavelength, with, a, pressure, anti, node, at, the, mouthpiece, and, a, pressure, node, at, the, open, end, for, air, reed, flute, and, fipple, flute, instruments, the, thin, grazing, air, sheet, planar, jet, flowing, across, an, opening, mouth, in, the, pipe, interacts, with, a, sharp, edge, labium, to, generate, sound, the, jet, is, generated, by, the, player, when, blowing, through, a, thin, slit, flue, for, recorders, and, flue, organ, pipes, this, slit, is, manufactured, by, the, instrument, maker, and, has, a, fixed, geometry, in, a, transverse, flute, or, a, pan, flute, the, slit, is, formed, by, the, musicians, between, their, lips, due, to, acoustic, oscillation, of, the, pipe, the, air, in, the, pipe, is, alternatively, compressed, and, expanded, this, results, in, an, alternating, flow, of, air, into, and, out, of, the, pipe, through, the, pipe, mouth, the, interaction, of, this, transversal, acoustic, flow, with, the, planar, air, jet, induces, at, the, flue, exit, origin, of, the, jet, a, localised, perturbation, of, the, velocity, profile, of, the, jet, this, perturbation, is, strongly, amplified, by, the, intrinsic, instability, of, the, jet, as, the, fluid, travels, towards, the, labium, this, results, into, a, global, transversal, motion, of, the, jet, at, the, labium, the, amplification, of, perturbations, of, a, jet, by, its, intrinsic, instability, can, be, observed, when, looking, at, a, plume, of, cigarette, smoke, any, small, amplitude, motion, of, the, hand, holding, the, cigarette, results, into, an, oscillation, of, the, plume, increasing, with, distance, upwards, and, eventually, a, chaotic, motion, turbulence, the, same, jet, oscillation, can, be, triggered, by, gentle, air, flow, in, the, room, which, can, be, verified, by, waving, with, the, other, hand, the, oscillation, of, the, jet, around, the, labium, results, into, a, fluctuating, force, of, the, airflow, on, the, labium, following, the, third, law, of, newton, the, labium, exerts, an, opposite, reaction, force, on, the, flow, one, can, demonstrate, that, this, reaction, force, is, the, source, of, sound, that, drives, the, acoustic, oscillation, of, the, pipe, a, quantitative, demonstration, of, the, nature, of, this, type, of, sound, source, has, been, provided, by, alan, powell, when, studying, a, planar, jet, interacting, with, a, sharp, edge, in, the, absence, of, pipe, so, called, edgetone, the, sound, radiated, from, the, edgetone, can, be, predicted, from, a, measurement, of, the, unsteady, force, induced, by, the, jet, flow, on, the, sharp, edge, labium, the, sound, production, by, the, reaction, of, the, wall, to, an, unsteady, force, of, the, flow, around, an, object, is, also, producing, the, aeolian, sound, of, a, cylinder, placed, normal, to, an, air, flow, singing, wire, phenomenon, in, all, these, cases, flute, edgetone, aeolian, tone, the, sound, production, does, not, involve, a, vibration, of, the, wall, hence, the, material, in, which, the, flute, is, made, is, not, relevant, for, the, principle, of, the, sound, production, there, is, no, essential, difference, between, a, golden, or, a, silver, flute, the, sound, production, in, a, flute, can, be, described, by, a, lumped, element, model, in, which, the, pipe, acts, as, an, acoustic, swing, mass, spring, system, resonator, that, preferentially, oscillates, at, a, natural, frequency, determined, by, the, length, of, the, tube, the, instability, of, the, jet, acts, as, an, amplifier, transferring, energy, from, the, steady, jet, flow, at, the, flue, exit, to, the, oscillating, flow, around, the, labium, the, pipe, forms, with, the, jet, a, feedback, loop, these, two, elements, are, coupled, at, the, flue, exit, and, at, the, labium, at, the, flue, exit, the, transversal, acoustic, flow, of, the, pipe, perturbs, the, jet, at, the, labium, the, jet, oscillation, results, in, a, generation, of, acoustic, waves, which, maintain, the, pipe, oscillation, the, acoustic, flow, in, the, pipe, can, for, a, steady, oscillation, be, described, in, terms, of, standing, waves, these, waves, have, a, pressure, node, at, the, mouth, opening, and, another, pressure, node, at, the, opposite, open, pipe, termination, standing, waves, inside, such, an, open, open, tube, will, be, multiples, of, a, half, wavelength, to, a, rough, approximation, a, tube, of, about, 40, cm, will, exhibit, resonances, near, the, following, points, in, practice, however, obtaining, a, range, of, musically, useful, tones, from, a, wind, instrument, depends, to, a, great, extent, on, careful, instrument, design, and, playing, technique, the, frequency, of, the, vibrational, modes, depends, on, the, speed, of, sound, in, air, which, varies, with, air, density, a, change, in, temperature, and, only, to, a, much, smaller, degree, also, a, change, in, humidity, influences, the, air, density, and, thus, the, speed, of, sound, and, therefore, affects, the, tuning, of, wind, instruments, the, effect, of, thermal, expansion, of, a, wind, instrument, even, of, a, brass, instrument, is, negligible, compared, to, the, thermal, effect, on, the, air, the, bell, of, a, wind, instrument, is, the, round, flared, opening, opposite, the, mouthpiece, it, is, found, on, clarinets, saxophones, oboes, horns, trumpets, and, many, other, kinds, of, instruments, on, brass, instruments, the, acoustical, coupling, from, the, bore, to, the, outside, air, occurs, at, the, bell, for, all, notes, and, the, shape, of, the, bell, optimizes, this, coupling, it, also, plays, a, major, role, in, transforming, the, resonances, of, the, instrument, on, woodwinds, most, notes, vent, at, the, uppermost, open, tone, holes, only, the, lowest, notes, of, each, register, vent, fully, or, partly, at, the, bell, and, the, bell, s, function, in, this, case, is, to, improve, the, consistency, in, tone, between, these, notes, and, the, others, playing, some, wind, instruments, in, particular, those, involving, high, breath, pressure, resistance, produce, increases, in, intraocular, pressure, which, has, been, linked, to, glaucoma, as, a, potential, health, risk, one, 2011, study, focused, on, brass, and, woodwind, instruments, observed, temporary, and, sometimes, dramatic, elevations, and, fluctuations, in, iop, another, study, found, that, the, magnitude, of, increase, in, intraocular, pressure, correlates, with, the, intraoral, resistance, associated, with, the, instrument, and, linked, intermittent, elevation, of, intraocular, pressure, from, playing, high, resistance, wind, instruments, to, incidence, of, visual, field, loss, the, range, of, intraoral, pressure, involved, in, various, classes, of, ethnic, wind, instruments, such, as, native, american, flutes, has, been, shown, to, be, generally, lower, than, western, classical, wind, instruments
