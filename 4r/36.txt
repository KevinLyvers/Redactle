pennsylvania, about, 70, miles, 110, km, southeast, of, pittsburgh, in, the, united, states, it, is, built, partly, over, a, waterfall, on, the, bear, run, river, the, house, was, designed, to, serve, as, a, weekend, retreat, for, liliane, and, edgar, j, kaufmann, the, owner, of, pittsburgh, s, kaufmann, s, department, store, after, its, completion, time, called, fallingwater, wright, s, most, beautiful, job, and, it, is, listed, among, smithsonian, s, life, list, of, 28, places, to, see, before, you, die, the, house, was, designated, a, national, historic, landmark, on, may, 11, 1976, in, 1991, members, of, the, american, institute, of, architects, named, fallingwater, the, best, all, time, work, of, american, architecture, and, in, 2007, ranked, fallingwater, 29th, on, its, america, s, favorite, architecture, list, in, 2019, the, house, and, seven, other, wright, constructions, were, inscribed, as, world, heritage, sites, under, the, title, the, 20th, century, architecture, of, frank, lloyd, wright, at, age, 67, frank, lloyd, wright, was, given, the, opportunity, to, design, and, construct, three, buildings, with, his, three, works, of, the, late, 1930s, fallingwater, the, johnson, wax, building, in, racine, wisconsin, and, the, herbert, jacobs, house, in, madison, wisconsin, wright, regained, his, prominence, in, the, architectural, community, edgar, j, kaufmann, was, a, pittsburgh, businessman, and, president, of, kaufmann, s, department, store, liliane, kaufmann, like, her, husband, was, a, keen, outdoors, person, she, enjoyed, both, hiking, and, horseback, riding, she, had, a, strong, aesthetic, sensibility, which, is, reflected, in, the, house, s, design, edgar, and, liliane, s, only, child, edgar, kaufmann, jr, became, the, catalyst, for, his, father, s, relationship, with, frank, lloyd, wright, in, the, summer, of, 1934, kaufmann, read, frank, lloyd, wright, s, an, autobiography, 1932, and, traveled, to, meet, him, at, his, home, in, wisconsin, in, late, september, within, three, weeks, he, began, an, apprenticeship, at, the, taliesin, fellowship, a, communal, architecture, program, established, in, 1932, by, wright, and, his, wife, olgivanna, it, was, during, a, visit, with, their, son, at, taliesin, in, november, 1934, that, edgar, and, liliane, kaufmann, first, met, wright, the, kaufmanns, lived, in, la, tourelle, a, french, norman, estate, in, fox, chapel, designed, in, 1923, by, pittsburgh, architect, benno, janssen, however, the, family, also, owned, a, remote, property, outside, pittsburgh, a, small, cabin, near, a, waterfall, which, was, used, as, a, summer, retreat, when, these, cabins, deteriorated, kaufmann, contacted, wright, on, december, 18, 1934, wright, visited, bear, run, and, asked, for, a, survey, of, the, area, around, the, waterfall, one, was, prepared, by, fayette, engineering, company, of, uniontown, pennsylvania, including, all, the, site, s, boulders, trees, and, topography, and, forwarded, to, wright, in, march, 1935, as, reported, by, frank, lloyd, wright, s, apprentices, at, taliesin, kaufmann, was, in, milwaukee, on, september, 22, nine, months, after, their, initial, meeting, and, called, wright, at, home, early, sunday, morning, to, surprise, him, with, the, news, that, he, would, be, visiting, him, that, day, wright, had, told, kaufmann, in, earlier, communications, that, he, had, been, making, progress, on, the, plans, but, in, actuality, he, had, not, done, anything, after, breakfast, amid, a, group, of, very, nervous, apprentices, wright, calmly, drew, the, plans, in, the, two, hours, in, which, it, took, kaufmann, to, drive, to, taliesin, witnesses, edgar, tafel, and, robert, mosher, taliesin, apprentices, at, the, time, later, stated, that, when, wright, was, designing, the, plans, he, spoke, of, how, the, spaces, would, be, used, directly, linking, form, to, function, wright, designed, the, home, above, the, waterfall, kaufmann, had, expected, it, to, be, below, the, falls, to, afford, a, view, of, the, cascades, it, has, been, said, that, he, was, initially, very, upset, with, this, change, the, kaufmanns, planned, to, entertain, large, groups, so, the, house, needed, to, be, larger, than, the, original, plot, allowed, they, also, requested, separate, bedrooms, as, well, as, a, bedroom, for, their, adult, son, and, an, additional, guest, room, a, cantilevered, structure, was, used, to, address, these, requests, the, structural, design, for, fallingwater, was, undertaken, by, wright, in, association, with, staff, engineers, mendel, glickman, and, william, wesley, peters, who, had, been, responsible, for, the, columns, in, wright, s, revolutionary, design, for, the, johnson, wax, headquarters, preliminary, plans, were, issued, to, kaufmann, for, approval, on, october, 15, 1935, after, which, wright, made, an, additional, visit, to, the, site, to, generate, a, cost, estimate, for, the, job, in, december, 1935, an, old, rock, quarry, was, reopened, to, the, west, of, the, site, to, provide, the, stones, needed, for, the, house, s, walls, wright, visited, only, periodically, during, construction, assigning, his, apprentice, robert, mosher, as, his, permanent, on, site, representative, the, final, drawings, were, issued, by, wright, in, march, 1936, with, work, beginning, on, the, bridge, and, main, house, in, april, the, construction, was, plagued, by, conflicts, between, wright, kaufmann, and, the, contractor, uncomfortable, with, what, he, saw, as, wright, s, insufficient, experience, using, reinforced, concrete, kaufmann, had, the, architect, s, daring, cantilever, design, reviewed, by, a, firm, of, consulting, engineers, upon, receiving, their, report, wright, took, offense, immediately, requesting, that, kaufmann, return, his, drawings, and, indicating, that, he, was, withdrawing, from, the, project, kaufmann, relented, to, wright, s, gambit, and, the, engineer, s, report, was, subsequently, buried, within, a, stone, wall, of, the, house, for, the, cantilevered, floors, wright, and, his, team, used, upside, down, t, shaped, beams, integrated, into, a, monolithic, concrete, slab, which, formed, both, the, ceiling, of, the, space, below, and, provided, resistance, against, compression, the, contractor, walter, hall, also, an, engineer, produced, independent, computations, and, argued, for, increasing, the, reinforcing, steel, in, the, first, floor, s, slab, wright, refused, the, suggestion, there, was, speculation, over, the, years, that, the, contractor, quietly, doubled, the, amount, of, reinforcement, versus, kaufmann, s, consulting, engineers, doubling, the, amount, of, steel, specified, by, wright, during, the, process, of, restoration, begun, in, 1995, it, was, confirmed, that, additional, concrete, reinforcement, had, been, added, in, addition, the, contractor, did, not, build, in, a, slight, upward, incline, in, the, formwork, for, the, cantilever, to, compensate, for, its, settling, and, deflection, once, the, formwork, was, removed, the, cantilever, developed, a, noticeable, sag, upon, learning, of, the, unapproved, steel, addition, wright, recalled, mosher, with, kaufmann, s, approval, the, consulting, engineers, had, a, supporting, wall, installed, under, the, main, supporting, beam, for, the, west, terrace, when, wright, discovered, it, on, a, site, visit, he, had, mosher, discreetly, remove, the, top, course, of, stones, when, kaufmann, later, confessed, to, what, had, been, done, wright, showed, him, what, mosher, had, done, and, pointed, out, that, the, cantilever, had, held, up, for, the, past, month, under, test, loads, without, the, wall, s, support, the, main, house, was, completed, in, 1938, and, the, guest, house, was, completed, the, following, year, the, original, estimated, cost, for, building, fallingwater, was, 35, 000, the, final, cost, for, the, home, and, guest, house, was, 155, 000, which, included, 75, 000, for, the, house, 22, 000, for, finishings, and, furnishings, 50, 000, for, the, guest, house, garage, and, servants, quarters, and, an, 8, 000, architect, s, fee, from, 1938, through, 1941, more, than, 22, 000, was, spent, on, additional, details, and, for, changes, in, the, hardware, and, lighting, the, total, cost, of, 155, 000, adjusted, for, inflation, is, equivalent, to, about, 3, 4, million, in, 2023, the, cost, of, the, house, s, restoration, in, 2001, was, estimated, to, be, 11, 5, million, approximately, 19, 8, million, in, 2023, fallingwater, was, the, kaufmann, family, s, weekend, home, from, 1937, until, 1963, when, edgar, kaufmann, jr, donated, the, property, to, the, western, pennsylvania, conservancy, the, family, retreated, to, fallingwater, on, weekends, to, escape, the, heat, and, smoke, of, industrial, pittsburgh, liliane, enjoyed, swimming, in, the, nude, and, collecting, modern, art, especially, the, works, of, diego, rivera, who, was, a, guest, at, the, country, house, understood, that, people, were, creatures, of, nature, hence, an, architecture, which, conformed, to, nature, would, conform, to, what, was, basic, in, people, for, example, although, all, of, falling, water, is, opened, by, broad, bands, of, windows, people, inside, are, sheltered, as, in, a, deep, cave, secure, in, the, sense, of, the, hill, behind, them, the, fallingwater, name, originated, with, wright, in, late, 1937, when, he, wrote, the, text, that, accompanied, a, feature, article, on, wright, s, career, in, the, january, 1938, architectural, forum, until, that, time, it, had, been, referred, to, on, wright, s, drawings, and, in, correspondence, as, the, e, j, kaufmann, residence, or, e, j, kaufmann, house, the, names, used, in, publications, covering, the, house, s, construction, the, new, name, immediately, became, popular, and, was, amplified, by, a, 1938, exhibition, at, the, museum, of, modern, art, and, in, henry, luce, s, popular, magazines, time, and, life, the, name, was, apparently, disliked, by, e, j, and, liliane, kaufmann, who, did, not, use, it, fallingwater, has, been, described, as, an, architectural, tour, de, force, of, wright, s, organic, architecture, the, building, includes, japanese, architectural, details, because, of, wright, s, love, of, japanese, architecture, contemporary, japanese, architect, tadao, ando, has, said, of, the, house, i, think, wright, learned, the, most, important, aspect, of, architecture, the, treatment, of, space, from, japanese, architecture, when, i, visited, fallingwater, in, pennsylvania, i, found, that, same, sensibility, of, space, but, there, was, the, additional, sounds, of, nature, that, appealed, to, me, the, private, residence, was, intended, to, be, a, nature, retreat, for, its, owners, it, is, built, on, top, of, an, active, waterfall, that, flows, beneath, the, house, wright, had, initially, planned, to, have, the, house, blend, into, its, natural, settings, in, rural, pennsylvania, in, doing, so, he, limited, his, palette, to, two, colors, a, light, ocher, for, the, concrete, and, his, signature, cherokee, red, for, the, steel, the, stone, walls, made, of, stone, from, local, quarries, and, cantilevered, terraces, were, intended, to, resemble, the, nearby, rock, formations, while, the, windows, and, balconies, extended, into, their, surroundings, in, conformance, with, wright, s, views, the, main, entry, door, is, away, from, the, falls, the, fireplace, hearth, in, the, living, room, integrates, boulders, found, on, the, site, upon, which, the, house, was, built, a, ledge, rock, which, protrudes, up, to, a, foot, through, the, living, room, floor, was, left, in, place, to, link, the, outside, with, the, inside, wright, had, initially, intended, that, the, ledge, be, cut, flush, with, the, floor, but, this, had, been, one, of, the, family, s, favorite, sunning, spots, so, kaufmann, suggested, that, it, be, left, as, it, was, the, stone, floors, are, waxed, while, the, hearth, is, left, plain, giving, the, impression, of, dry, rocks, protruding, from, a, stream, even, with, smaller, details, wright, tried, to, integrate, the, exterior, and, interior, designs, where, glass, meets, stone, walls, the, glass, and, its, horizontal, dividers, were, run, into, a, caulked, recess, in, the, stonework, so, that, the, stone, walls, appear, uninterrupted, by, glazing, from, the, cantilevered, living, room, a, stairway, leads, directly, down, to, an, isolated, platform, at, the, stream, below, a, connecting, space, which, connects, the, main, house, with, the, guest, and, servant, level, a, natural, spring, drips, water, inside, which, is, then, channeled, back, out, bedrooms, are, small, some, with, low, ceilings, this, was, intended, to, encourage, people, outward, toward, the, open, social, areas, decks, and, outdoors, on, the, hillside, above, the, main, house, stands, a, four, bay, carport, servants, quarters, and, a, guest, house, these, attached, outbuildings, were, built, two, years, later, using, the, same, quality, of, materials, and, attention, to, detail, as, the, main, house, the, guest, quarters, feature, a, spring, fed, swimming, pool, which, overflows, and, drains, into, the, river, below, after, fallingwater, was, deeded, to, the, public, three, carport, bays, were, enclosed, at, the, direction, of, kaufmann, jr, to, be, used, by, museum, visitors, for, the, viewing, of, a, presentation, at, the, end, of, their, guided, tours, on, the, western, pennsylvania, conservancy, to, which, the, home, was, entrusted, kaufmann, jr, designed, its, interior, himself, according, to, specifications, found, in, other, fallingwater, interiors, by, wright, a, model, of, the, house, was, featured, at, the, museum, of, modern, art, in, 2009, after, his, father, s, death, in, 1955, kaufmann, jr, inherited, fallingwater, continuing, to, use, it, as, a, weekend, retreat, until, the, early, 1960s, increasingly, concerned, with, ensuring, fallingwater, s, preservation, and, following, his, father, s, wishes, he, entrusted, the, home, and, approximately, 1, 500, acres, of, land, to, the, western, pennsylvania, conservancy, in, tribute, to, his, parents, he, guided, the, organization, s, thinking, about, fallingwater, s, administration, care, and, educational, programming, and, was, a, frequent, visitor, as, guided, tours, began, in, 1964, kaufmann, s, partner, architect, and, designer, paul, may, n, also, contributed, to, the, legacy, of, fallingwater, with, a, design, for, the, visitor, center, completed, in, 1981, the, house, attracts, more, than, 160, 000, visitors, from, around, the, world, each, year, fallingwater, had, shown, signs, of, deterioration, over, the, past, 80, years, due, in, large, part, to, its, exposure, to, humidity, and, sunlight, the, severe, freeze, thaw, conditions, of, southwest, pennsylvania, and, water, infiltration, also, affected, the, structural, materials, because, of, these, conditions, a, thorough, cleaning, of, the, exterior, stone, walls, is, performed, periodically, fallingwater, s, six, bathrooms, are, lined, with, cork, tiles, when, used, as, a, flooring, material, the, cork, tiles, were, hand, waxed, giving, them, a, shiny, finish, that, supplemented, their, natural, ability, to, repel, water, over, time, the, cork, has, begun, to, show, water, damage, requiring, the, conservancy, to, make, frequent, repairs, in, addition, fallingwater, s, structural, system, includes, a, series, of, very, bold, reinforced, concrete, cantilevered, balconies, pronounced, deflection, of, the, concrete, cantilevers, was, noticed, as, soon, as, the, formwork, was, removed, during, construction, this, deflection, increased, over, time, eventually, reaching, 7, inches, 180, mm, over, a, 15, foot, 4, 6, m, span, in, 1995, the, western, pennsylvania, conservancy, commissioned, a, study, of, the, site, s, structural, integrity, structural, engineers, analyzed, the, movement, of, the, cantilevers, over, time, and, conducted, radar, analysis, to, locate, and, quantify, the, reinforcement, the, data, proved, the, contractor, had, indeed, added, reinforcement, over, wright, s, plan, nevertheless, the, cantilevers, were, still, insufficiently, reinforced, both, the, concrete, and, its, steel, reinforcement, were, close, to, their, failure, limits, an, architectural, firm, was, hired, to, fix, the, problem, beginning, with, the, installation, of, temporary, girders, in, 1997, in, 2002, the, structure, was, repaired, permanently, using, post, tensioning, the, living, room, flagstone, floor, blocks, were, individually, tagged, and, removed, blocks, were, joined, to, the, concrete, cantilever, beams, and, floor, joists, high, strength, steel, cables, were, fed, through, the, blocks, and, exterior, concrete, walls, and, tightened, using, jacks, the, floors, and, walls, were, then, restored, leaving, fallingwater, s, interior, and, exterior, appearance, unchanged, as, of, 2011, the, cantilevers, have, sufficient, support, and, the, deflection, has, stopped, the, conservancy, continues, to, monitor, movement, in, the, cantilevers
