the, four, seasons, italian, le, quattro, stagioni, is, a, group, of, four, violin, concerti, by, italian, composer, antonio, vivaldi, each, of, which, gives, musical, expression, to, a, season, of, the, year, these, were, composed, around, 1718, 1720, when, vivaldi, was, the, court, chapel, master, in, mantua, they, were, published, in, 1725, in, amsterdam, together, with, eight, additional, concerti, as, il, cimento, dell, armonia, e, dell, inventione, the, contest, between, harmony, and, invention, the, four, seasons, is, the, best, known, of, vivaldi, s, works, though, three, of, the, concerti, are, wholly, original, the, first, spring, borrows, patterns, from, a, sinfonia, in, the, first, act, of, vivaldi, s, contemporaneous, opera, il, giustino, the, inspiration, for, the, concertos, is, not, the, countryside, around, mantua, as, initially, supposed, where, vivaldi, was, living, at, the, time, since, according, to, karl, heller, they, could, have, been, written, as, early, as, 1716, 1717, while, vivaldi, was, engaged, with, the, court, of, mantua, only, in, 1718, they, were, a, revolution, in, musical, conception, vivaldi, represented, flowing, creeks, singing, birds, of, different, species, each, specifically, characterized, a, shepherd, and, his, barking, dog, buzzing, flies, storms, drunken, dancers, hunting, parties, from, both, the, hunters, and, the, prey, s, point, of, view, frozen, landscapes, and, warm, winter, fires, unusually, for, the, period, vivaldi, published, the, concerti, with, accompanying, sonnets, possibly, written, by, the, composer, himself, that, elucidated, what, it, was, in, the, spirit, of, each, season, that, his, music, was, intended, to, evoke, the, concerti, therefore, stand, as, one, of, the, earliest, and, most, detailed, examples, of, what, would, come, to, be, called, program, music, in, other, words, music, with, a, narrative, element, vivaldi, took, great, pains, to, relate, his, music, to, the, texts, of, the, poems, translating, the, poetic, lines, themselves, directly, into, the, music, on, the, page, for, example, in, the, middle, section, of, spring, when, the, goatherd, sleeps, his, barking, dog, can, be, heard, in, the, viola, section, the, music, is, elsewhere, similarly, evocative, of, other, natural, sounds, vivaldi, divided, each, concerto, into, three, movements, fast, slow, fast, and, likewise, each, linked, sonnet, into, three, sections, vivaldi, s, arrangement, is, as, follows, a, performance, of, all, four, concerti, may, take, about, 40, 43, minutes, approximate, timings, of, the, individual, concerti, there, is, some, debate, as, to, whether, the, four, concertos, were, written, to, accompany, four, sonnets, or, vice, versa, though, it, is, not, known, who, wrote, the, accompanying, sonnets, the, theory, that, vivaldi, wrote, them, is, supported, by, the, fact, that, each, sonnet, is, broken, into, three, sections, each, neatly, corresponding, to, a, movement, in, the, concerto, regardless, of, the, sonnets, authorship, the, four, seasons, can, be, classified, as, program, music, instrumental, music, intended, to, evoke, something, extra, musical, and, an, art, form, which, vivaldi, was, determined, to, prove, sophisticated, enough, to, be, taken, seriously, in, addition, to, these, sonnets, vivaldi, provided, instructions, such, as, the, barking, dog, in, the, second, movement, of, spring, languor, caused, by, the, heat, in, the, first, movement, of, summer, and, the, drunkards, have, fallen, asleep, in, the, second, movement, of, autumn, a, new, translation, of, the, sonnets, into, english, by, armand, d, angour, was, published, in, 2019, allegro, giunt, la, primavera, e, festosetti, la, salutan, gl,

the, first, recording, of, the, four, seasons, are, disputed, there, is, a, compact, disc, of, a, recording, made, by, the, violinist, alfredo, campoli, taken, from, acetates, of, a, french, radio, broadcast, these, are, thought, to, date, from, early, in, 1939, the, first, proper, electrical, recording, was, made, in, 1942, by, bernardino, molinari, though, his, is, a, somewhat, different, interpretation, from, modern, performances, it, is, clearly, recognisable, as, the, four, seasons, molinari, s, recording, was, made, for, cetra, and, was, issued, in, italy, and, subsequently, in, the, united, states, on, six, double, sided, 78s, in, the, 1940s, it, was, then, reissued, on, long, playing, album, in, 1950, and, later, on, compact, disc, the, first, american, recording, was, made, in, the, final, week, of, 1947, by, the, violinist, louis, kaufman, the, recording, was, made, at, carnegie, hall, in, advance, of, a, scheduled, recording, ban, effective, 1, january, 1948, the, performers, were, the, concert, hall, chamber, orchestra, under, henry, swoboda, edith, weiss, mann, harpsichord, and, edouard, nies, berger, organ, this, recording, helped, the, re, popularisation, of, vivaldi, s, music, in, the, mainstream, repertoire, of, europe, and, america, following, on, the, work, done, by, molinari, and, others, in, italy, it, won, the, french, grand, prix, du, disque, in, 1950, was, elected, to, the, grammy, hall, of, fame, in, 2002, and, was, selected, the, following, year, for, the, national, recording, registry, in, the, library, of, congress, kaufman, intrigued, to, learn, that, the, four, concertos, were, in, fact, part, of, a, set, of, twelve, set, about, finding, a, full, score, and, eventually, recorded, the, other, eight, concertos, in, z, rich, in, 1950, making, his, the, first, recording, of, vivaldi, s, complete, op, 8, the, ensemble, i, musici, has, recorded, the, four, seasons, probably, more, often, than, any, other, established, musical, group, to, date, the, debut, recording, in, 1955, with, felix, ayo, again, with, ayo, in, 1959, this, time, in, stereo, the, very, first, stereo, recording, of, the, work, subsequent, recordings, featuring, roberto, michelucci, 1969, the, highly, acclaimed, 1982, recording, with, pina, carmirelli, federico, agostini, 1988, mariana, s, rbu, 1995, antonio, anselmi, 2012, and, marco, fiorini, 2021, there, is, also, a, video, recording, of, the, four, seasons, performed, by, i, musici, in, antonio, vivaldi, s, hometown, of, venice, filmed, by, anton, van, munster, in, 1988, the, 1969, argo, recording, by, the, academy, of, st, martin, in, the, fields, conducted, by, neville, marriner, and, featuring, the, soloist, alan, loveday, sold, over, half, a, million, copies, it, became, the, ensemble, s, first, gold, record, i, solisti, di, zagreb, under, the, baton, of, antonio, janigro, with, jan, tomasow, as, violin, soloist, and, anton, heiller, on, harpsichord, followed, in, 1957, on, the, vanguard, label, further, reissued, under, the, philips, and, other, labels, wilfrid, mellers, an, english, music, critic, musicologist, and, composer, wrote, of, this, performance, the, soloists, phrase, their, lyricism, beautifully, john, thornton, wrote, about, this, recording, here, is, matchless, ensemble, playing, topped, by, tomasow, s, secure, playing, janigro, reveals, his, talent, for, conducting, which, competes, with, his, considerable, talent, for, cello, playing, ivan, supek, wrote, of, this, recording, i, will, attempt, to, convey, to, you, how, much, this, performance, means, to, me, and, might, mean, to, you, as, well, my, first, encounter, with, the, records, took, place, almost, thirty, years, ago, when, our, antonio, revealed, to, me, the, true, significance, of, the, piece, of, another, great, antonio, his, famous, namesake, whose, le, quattro, staggioni, i, could, hardly, listen, any, more, because, of, the, grand, actually, too, grand, performances, usual, at, that, time, let, alone, enjoy, them, what, a, change, it, was, a, window, into, a, new, world, music, is, fast, precise, and, true, to, life, the, intonation, is, correct, the, continuo, appropriate, and, the, violin, of, beautiful, sound, in, fitting, correlation, with, the, zagreb, soloists, the, self, assured, and, fine, tone, of, jan, tomasow, s, solo, violin, relates, perfectly, with, the, soloists, the, entire, performance, is, impregnated, with, the, spirit, of, janigro, s, perfectionism, leaving, the, music, and, its, soul, fully, exposed, it, had, been, for, a, long, time, the, only, performance, i, could, listen, to, only, during, last, decade, some, new, kids, playing, authentic, instruments, have, offered, to, me, similar, pleasure, and, insights, into, the, music, of, antonio, vivaldi, and, to, my, great, pleasure, janigro, s, performance, is, no, longer, the, only, choice, for, me, in, my, opinion, this, also, shows, how, janigro, s, performance, in, cooperation, with, the, zagreb, soloists, was, far, ahead, its, time, as, corroborated, by, igor, stravinsky, who, claimed, that, it, was, the, most, beautiful, performance, of, le, quattro, staggioni, he, had, ever, heard, a, statement, which, i, only, recently, learned, about, no, wonder, since, such, bareness, and, precision, of, janigro, s, interpretation, must, have, appealed, to, him, it, was, much, later, that, i, discovered, the, excellence, of, the, recording, as, well, at, that, time, the, zagreb, soloists, were, recording, for, vanguard, mostly, in, vienna, at, various, locations, and, this, particular, recording, was, made, in, 1957, at, rotenturmstrassaal, recording, was, produced, by, seymour, solomon, chief, producer, of, the, entire, edition, who, would, personally, come, from, the, usa, to, oversee, every, recording, to, be, made, by, the, zagreb, soloists, whereas, the, vanguard, branch, in, vienna, amadeo, was, in, charge, of, the, organisation, my, gratitude, to, one, of, the, founders, of, the, zagreb, soloists, mr, stjepan, aranjo, for, providing, me, with, some, important, insights, janigro, was, a, perfectionist, often, rather, merciless, not, only, in, matters, of, music, but, also, in, terms, of, the, sound, so, he, participated, directly, and, intensely, in, recording, process, which, was, quite, uncommon, at, that, time, all, that, great, care, by, all, participants, in, the, project, is, amply, reflected, in, the, recording, itself, resulting, in, an, airy, performance, of, appropriate, spaciousness, and, extension, with, only, occasional, congestion, of, high, tones, in, forte, sections, paul, shoemaker, wrote, about, this, recording, nothing, i, have, heard, changes, my, view, that, the, best, seasons, ever, was, performed, by, jan, tomasow, and, i, solisti, di, zagreb, and, beautifully, recorded, by, vanguard, at, the, very, beginning, of, the, stereo, era, if, you, have, almost, every, other, version, of, the, seasons, you, ll, want, this, one, too, if, money, and, space, are, no, obstacle, it, might, be, worth, having, nigel, kennedy, s, 1989, recording, of, the, four, seasons, with, the, english, chamber, orchestra, sold, over, three, million, copies, worldwide, becoming, one, of, the, best, selling, classical, works, ever, the, marketing, of, kennedy, s, record, was, described, as, the, first, time, that, a, classical, artist, had, been, given, the, full, pop, marketing, treatment, with, a, promotional, single, and, advertisements, on, billboards, tv, and, radio, gil, shaham, and, the, orpheus, chamber, orchestra, recorded, the, four, seasons, as, well, as, a, music, video, for, the, first, movement, of, winter, that, was, featured, regularly, on, the, weather, channel, in, the, mid, 1990s, surround, sound, versions, of, the, piece, have, been, issued, on, super, audio, cd, by, richard, tognetti, pinchas, zukerman, jonathan, carney, and, rachel, podger, the, world, s, encyclopedia, of, recorded, music, in, 1952, cites, only, two, recordings, of, the, four, seasons, by, molinari, and, kaufman, by, 2011, approximately, 1, 000, recorded, versions, have, been, made, since, campoli, s, in, 1939, in, 2009, all, four, concertos, were, arranged, for, piano, by, pianist, jeffrey, biegel, classical, musicians, have, sought, to, distinguish, their, recordings, of, the, four, seasons, with, historically, informed, performances, and, embellishments, to, the, point, of, varying, the, instruments, and, tempi, or, playing, notes, differently, from, the, listener, s, expectation, whether, specified, by, the, composer, or, not, it, is, said, that, vivaldi, s, work, presents, such, opportunities, for, improvisation, many, period, based, ensembles, have, recorded, the, four, seasons, including, la, serenissima, under, the, direction, of, adrian, chandler, who, recorded, the, manchester, version, of, the, four, seasons, the, english, concert, under, the, direction, of, trevor, pinnock, the, academy, of, ancient, music, under, the, direction, of, christopher, hogwood, and, europa, galante, under, the, direction, of, fabio, biondi, the, four, seasons, was, voted, 67, in, the, classic, fm, hall, of, fame, three, of, the, four, concerti, were, included, in, the, classic, 100, concerto, listing, derivative, works, of, these, concerti, include, arrangements, transcriptions, covers, remixes, samples, and, parodies, in, music, themes, in, theater, and, opera, soundtracks, in, films, or, video, games, and, choreography, in, ballet, along, with, contemporary, dance, figure, skating, rhythmic, gymnastics, synchronized, swimming, etc, either, in, their, entirety, single, movements, or, medleys, antonio, vivaldi, appears, to, have, started, this, trend, of, adapting, music, from, the, four, seasons, and, since, then, it, has, expanded, into, many, aspects, of, the, performing, arts, as, have, other, instrumental, vocal, works, by, the, composer, this, contest, between, harmony, and, invention, as, it, were, now, involves, various, genres, around, the, world
