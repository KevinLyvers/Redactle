de, revolutionibus, orbium, coelestium, english, translation, on, the, revolutions, of, the, heavenly, spheres, is, the, seminal, work, on, the, heliocentric, theory, of, the, astronomer, nicolaus, copernicus, 1473, 1543, of, the, polish, renaissance, the, book, first, printed, in, 1543, in, nuremberg, holy, roman, empire, offered, an, alternative, model, of, the, universe, to, ptolemy, s, geocentric, system, which, had, been, widely, accepted, since, ancient, times, copernicus, initially, outlined, his, system, in, a, short, untitled, anonymous, manuscript, that, he, distributed, to, several, friends, referred, to, as, the, commentariolus, a, physician, s, library, list, dating, to, 1514, includes, a, manuscript, whose, description, matches, the, commentariolus, so, copernicus, must, have, begun, work, on, his, new, system, by, that, time, most, historians, believe, that, he, wrote, the, commentariolus, after, his, return, from, italy, possibly, only, after, 1510, at, this, time, copernicus, anticipated, that, he, could, reconcile, the, motion, of, the, earth, with, the, perceived, motions, of, the, planets, easily, with, fewer, motions, than, were, necessary, in, the, version, of, the, ptolemaic, system, current, at, the, time, among, other, techniques, the, heliocentric, copernican, model, made, use, of, the, urdi, lemma, developed, in, the, 13th, century, by, the, arab, astronomer, mu, ayyad, al, din, al, urdi, the, first, of, the, maragha, astronomers, to, develop, a, geocentric, but, non, ptolemaic, model, of, planetary, motion, observations, of, mercury, by, bernhard, walther, 1430, 1504, of, nuremberg, a, pupil, of, regiomontanus, were, made, available, to, copernicus, by, johannes, sch, ner, 45, observations, in, total, 14, of, them, with, longitude, and, latitude, copernicus, used, three, of, them, in, de, revolutionibus, giving, only, longitudes, and, erroneously, attributing, them, to, sch, ner, copernicus, values, differed, slightly, from, the, ones, published, by, sch, ner, in, 1544, in, observationes, xxx, annorum, a, i, regiomontano, et, b, walthero, norimbergae, habitae, a, manuscript, of, de, revolutionibus, in, copernicus, own, hand, has, survived, after, his, death, it, was, given, to, his, pupil, rheticus, who, for, publication, had, only, been, given, a, copy, without, annotations, via, heidelberg, it, ended, up, in, prague, where, it, was, rediscovered, and, studied, in, the, 19th, century, close, examination, of, the, manuscript, including, the, different, types, of, paper, used, helped, scholars, construct, an, approximate, timetable, for, its, composition, apparently, copernicus, began, by, making, a, few, astronomical, observations, to, provide, new, data, to, perfect, his, models, he, may, have, begun, writing, the, book, while, still, engaged, in, observations, by, the, 1530s, a, substantial, part, of, the, book, was, complete, but, copernicus, hesitated, to, publish, in, 1536, cardinal, nikolaus, von, sch, nberg, wrote, to, copernicus, and, urged, him, to, publish, his, manuscript, in, 1539, georg, joachim, rheticus, a, young, mathematician, from, wittenberg, arrived, in, frauenburg, frombork, to, study, with, him, rheticus, read, copernicus, manuscript, and, immediately, wrote, a, non, technical, summary, of, its, main, theories, in, the, form, of, an, open, letter, addressed, to, sch, ner, his, astrology, teacher, in, n, rnberg, he, published, this, letter, as, the, narratio, prima, in, danzig, in, 1540, rheticus, friend, and, mentor, achilles, gasser, published, a, second, edition, of, the, narratio, in, basel, in, 1541, due, to, its, friendly, reception, copernicus, finally, agreed, to, publication, of, more, of, his, main, work, in, 1542, a, treatise, on, trigonometry, which, was, taken, from, the, second, book, of, the, still, unpublished, de, revolutionibus, rheticus, published, it, in, copernicus, name, under, strong, pressure, from, rheticus, and, having, seen, that, the, first, general, reception, of, his, work, had, not, been, unfavorable, copernicus, finally, agreed, to, give, the, book, to, his, close, friend, bishop, tiedemann, giese, to, be, delivered, to, rheticus, in, wittenberg, for, printing, by, johannes, petreius, at, n, rnberg, nuremberg, it, was, published, just, before, copernicus, death, in, 1543, copernicus, kept, a, copy, of, his, manuscript, which, sometime, after, his, death, was, sent, to, rheticus, in, the, attempt, to, produce, an, authentic, unaltered, version, of, the, book, the, plan, failed, but, the, copy, was, found, during, the, 18th, century, and, was, published, later, it, is, kept, at, the, jagiellonian, university, library, in, krak, w, where, it, remains, bearing, the, library, number, bj, 10, 000, from, the, first, edition, copernicus, book, was, prefixed, with, an, anonymous, preface, which, argues, that, the, following, is, a, calculus, consistent, with, the, observations, and, cannot, resolve, philosophical, truths, only, later, was, this, revealed, to, be, the, unauthorized, interjection, by, lutheran, preacher, andreas, osiander, who, lived, in, nuremberg, when, the, first, edition, was, printed, there, this, is, followed, by, copernicus, own, preface, where, he, dedicates, his, work, to, pope, paul, iii, and, appeals, to, the, latter, s, skill, as, a, mathematician, to, recognize, the, truth, of, copernicus, hypothesis, de, revolutionibus, is, divided, into, six, books, sections, or, parts, following, closely, the, layout, of, ptolemy, s, almagest, which, it, updated, and, replaced, copernicus, argued, that, the, universe, comprised, eight, spheres, the, outermost, consisted, of, motionless, fixed, stars, with, the, sun, motionless, at, the, center, the, known, planets, revolved, about, the, sun, each, in, its, own, sphere, in, the, order, mercury, venus, earth, mars, jupiter, saturn, the, moon, however, revolved, in, its, sphere, around, the, earth, what, appeared, to, be, the, daily, revolution, of, the, sun, and, fixed, stars, around, the, earth, was, actually, the, earth, s, daily, rotation, on, its, own, axis, copernicus, adhered, to, one, of, the, standard, beliefs, of, his, time, namely, that, the, motions, of, celestial, bodies, must, be, composed, of, uniform, circular, motions, for, this, reason, he, was, unable, to, account, for, the, observed, apparent, motion, of, the, planets, without, retaining, a, complex, system, of, epicycles, similar, to, those, of, the, ptolemaic, system, despite, copernicus, adherence, to, this, aspect, of, ancient, astronomy, his, radical, shift, from, a, geocentric, to, a, heliocentric, cosmology, was, a, serious, blow, to, aristotle, s, science, and, helped, usher, in, the, scientific, revolution, rheticus, left, n, rnberg, to, take, up, his, post, as, professor, in, leipzig, andreas, osiander, had, taken, over, the, task, of, supervising, the, printing, and, publication, in, an, effort, to, reduce, the, controversial, impact, of, the, book, osiander, added, his, own, unsigned, letter, ad, lectorem, de, hypothesibus, huius, operis, to, the, reader, concerning, the, hypotheses, of, this, work, printed, in, front, of, copernicus, preface, which, was, a, dedicatory, letter, to, pope, paul, iii, and, which, kept, the, title, praefatio, authoris, to, acknowledge, that, the, unsigned, letter, was, not, by, the, book, s, author, osiander, s, letter, stated, that, copernicus, system, was, mathematics, intended, to, aid, computation, and, not, an, attempt, to, declare, literal, truth, it, is, the, duty, of, an, astronomer, to, compose, the, history, of, the, celestial, motions, through, careful, and, expert, study, then, he, must, conceive, and, devise, the, causes, of, these, motions, or, hypotheses, about, them, since, he, cannot, in, any, way, attain, to, the, true, causes, he, will, adopt, whatever, suppositions, enable, the, motions, to, be, computed, correctly, the, present, author, has, performed, both, these, duties, excellently, for, these, hypotheses, need, not, be, true, nor, even, probable, on, the, contrary, if, they, provide, a, calculus, consistent, with, the, observations, that, alone, is, enough, for, this, art, it, is, quite, clear, is, completely, and, absolutely, ignorant, of, the, causes, of, the, apparent, and, if, any, causes, are, devised, by, the, imagination, as, indeed, very, many, are, they, are, not, put, forward, to, convince, anyone, that, they, are, true, but, merely, to, provide, a, reliable, basis, for, computation, however, since, different, hypotheses, are, sometimes, offered, for, one, and, the, same, the, astronomer, will, take, as, his, first, choice, that, hypothesis, which, is, the, easiest, to, grasp, the, philosopher, will, perhaps, rather, seek, the, semblance, of, the, truth, but, neither, of, them, will, understand, or, state, anything, certain, unless, it, has, been, divinely, revealed, to, him, let, no, one, expect, anything, certain, from, astronomy, which, cannot, furnish, it, lest, he, accept, as, the, truth, ideas, conceived, for, another, purpose, and, depart, this, study, a, greater, fool, than, when, he, entered, as, even, osiander, s, defenders, point, out, the, ad, lectorem, expresses, views, on, the, aim, and, nature, of, scientific, theories, at, variance, with, copernicus, claims, for, his, own, theory, many, view, osiander, s, letter, as, a, betrayal, of, science, and, copernicus, and, an, attempt, to, pass, his, own, thoughts, off, as, those, of, the, book, s, author, an, example, of, this, type, of, claim, can, be, seen, in, the, catholic, encyclopedia, which, states, fortunately, for, him, he, could, not, see, what, osiander, had, done, this, reformer, knowing, the, attitude, of, luther, and, melanchthon, against, the, heliocentric, system, without, adding, his, own, name, replaced, the, preface, of, copernicus, by, another, strongly, contrasting, in, spirit, with, that, of, copernicus, while, osiander, s, motives, behind, the, letter, have, been, questioned, by, many, he, has, been, defended, by, historian, bruce, wrightsman, who, points, out, he, was, not, an, enemy, of, science, osiander, had, many, scientific, connections, including, johannes, schoner, rheticus, s, teacher, whom, osiander, recommended, for, his, post, at, the, nurnberg, gymnasium, peter, apian, of, ingolstadt, university, hieronymous, schreiber, joachim, camerarius, erasmus, reinhold, joachim, rheticus, and, finally, hieronymous, cardan, the, historian, wrightsman, put, forward, that, osiander, did, not, sign, the, letter, because, he, was, such, a, notorious, reformer, whose, name, was, well, known, and, infamous, among, catholics, so, that, signing, would, have, likely, caused, negative, scrutiny, of, the, work, of, copernicus, a, loyal, catholic, canon, and, scholar, copernicus, himself, had, communicated, to, osiander, his, own, fears, that, his, work, would, be, scrutinized, and, criticized, by, the, peripatetics, and, theologians, and, he, had, already, been, in, trouble, with, his, bishop, johannes, dantiscus, on, account, of, his, former, relationship, with, his, mistress, and, friendship, with, dantiscus, s, enemy, and, suspected, heretic, alexander, scultetus, it, was, also, possible, that, protestant, nurnberg, could, fall, to, the, forces, of, the, holy, roman, emperor, and, since, the, books, of, hostile, theologians, could, be, burned, why, not, scientific, works, with, the, names, of, hated, theologians, affixed, to, them, wrightsman, also, holds, that, this, is, why, copernicus, did, not, mention, his, top, student, rheticus, a, lutheran, in, the, book, s, dedication, to, the, pope, osiander, s, interest, in, astronomy, was, theological, hoping, for, improving, the, chronology, of, historical, events, and, thus, providing, more, accurate, apocalyptic, interpretations, of, the, bible, the, general, awareness, that, the, calendar, was, not, in, agreement, with, astronomical, movement, and, therefore, needed, to, be, corrected, by, devising, better, models, on, which, to, base, calculations, in, an, era, before, the, telescope, osiander, like, most, of, the, era, s, mathematical, astronomers, attempted, to, bridge, the, fundamental, incompatibility, between, ptolemaic, astronomy, and, aristotlian, physics, and, the, need, to, preserve, both, by, taking, an, instrumentalist, position, only, the, handful, of, philosophical, purists, like, the, averroists, demanded, physical, consistency, and, thus, sought, for, realist, models, copernicus, was, hampered, by, his, insistence, on, preserving, the, idea, that, celestial, bodies, had, to, travel, in, perfect, circles, he, was, still, attached, to, classical, ideas, of, circular, motion, around, deferents, and, epicycles, and, spheres, this, was, particularly, troubling, concerning, the, earth, because, he, attached, the, earth, s, axis, rigidly, to, a, sun, centered, sphere, the, unfortunate, consequence, was, that, the, terrestrial, rotation, axis, then, maintained, the, same, inclination, with, respect, to, the, sun, as, the, sphere, turned, eliminating, the, seasons, to, explain, the, seasons, he, had, to, propose, a, third, motion, an, annual, contrary, conical, sweep, of, the, terrestrial, axis, it, was, not, until, the, great, comet, of, 1577, which, moved, as, if, there, were, no, spheres, to, crash, through, that, the, idea, was, challenged, in, 1609, johannes, kepler, fixed, copernicus, theory, by, stating, that, the, planets, orbit, the, sun, not, in, circles, but, ellipses, only, after, kepler, s, refinement, of, copernicus, theory, was, the, need, for, deferents, and, epicycles, abolished, in, his, work, copernicus, used, conventional, hypothetical, devices, like, epicycles, as, all, astronomers, had, done, since, antiquity, hypothetical, constructs, solely, designed, to, save, the, phenomena, and, aid, computation, ptolemy, s, theory, contained, a, hypothesis, about, the, epicycle, of, venus, that, was, viewed, as, absurd, if, seen, as, anything, other, than, a, geometrical, device, its, brightness, and, distance, should, have, varied, greatly, but, they, don, t, in, spite, of, this, defect, in, ptolemy, s, theory, copernicus, hypothesis, predicts, approximately, the, same, variations, because, of, the, use, of, similar, terms, and, similar, deficiencies, osiander, could, see, little, technical, or, physical, truth, gain, between, one, system, and, the, other, it, was, this, attitude, towards, technical, astronomy, that, had, allowed, it, to, function, since, antiquity, despite, its, inconsistencies, with, the, principles, of, physics, and, the, philosophical, objections, of, averroists, writing, ad, lectorem, osiander, was, influenced, by, pico, della, mirandola, s, idea, that, humanity, orders, cosmos, out, of, the, chaos, of, opinions, from, pico, s, writings, osiander, learned, to, extract, and, synthesize, insights, from, many, sources, without, becoming, the, slavish, follower, of, any, of, them, the, effect, of, pico, on, osiander, was, tempered, by, the, influence, of, nicholas, of, cusa, and, his, idea, of, coincidentia, oppositorum, rather, than, having, pico, s, focus, on, human, effort, osiander, followed, cusa, s, idea, that, understanding, the, universe, and, its, creator, only, came, from, divine, inspiration, rather, than, intellectual, organization, from, these, influences, osiander, held, that, in, the, area, of, philosophical, speculation, and, scientific, hypothesis, there, are, no, heretics, of, the, intellect, but, when, one, gets, past, speculation, into, truth, claims, the, bible, is, the, ultimate, measure, by, holding, that, copernicianism, was, mathematical, speculation, osiander, held, that, it, would, be, silly, to, hold, it, up, against, the, accounts, of, the, bible, pico, s, influence, on, osiander, did, not, escape, rheticus, who, reacted, strongly, against, the, ad, lectorem, as, historian, robert, s, westman, puts, it, the, more, profound, source, of, rheticus, s, ire, however, was, osiander, s, view, of, astronomy, as, a, disciple, fundamentally, incapable, of, knowing, anything, with, certainty, for, rheticus, this, extreme, position, surely, must, have, resonated, uncomfortably, with, pico, della, mirandola, s, attack, on, the, foundations, of, divinatory, astrology, in, his, disputations, pico, had, made, a, devastating, attack, on, astrology, because, those, who, were, making, astrological, predictions, relied, on, astronomers, to, tell, them, where, the, planets, were, they, also, became, a, target, pico, held, that, since, astronomers, who, calculate, planetary, positions, could, not, agree, among, themselves, how, were, they, to, be, held, as, reliable, while, pico, could, bring, into, concordance, writers, like, aristotle, plato, plotinus, averroes, avicenna, and, aquinas, the, lack, of, consensus, he, saw, in, astronomy, was, a, proof, to, him, of, its, fallibility, alongside, astrology, pico, pointed, out, that, the, astronomers, instruments, were, imprecise, and, any, imperfection, of, even, a, degree, made, them, worthless, for, astrology, people, should, not, trust, astrologists, because, they, should, not, trust, the, numbers, from, astronomers, pico, pointed, out, that, astronomers, couldn, t, even, tell, where, the, sun, appeared, in, the, order, of, the, planets, as, they, orbited, the, earth, some, put, it, close, to, the, moon, others, among, the, planets, how, pico, asked, could, astrologists, possibly, claim, they, could, read, what, was, going, on, when, the, astronomers, they, relied, on, could, offer, no, precision, on, even, basic, questions, as, westman, points, out, to, rheticus, it, would, seem, that, osiander, now, offered, new, grounds, for, endorsing, pico, s, conclusions, not, merely, was, the, disagreement, among, astronomers, grounds, for, mistrusting, the, sort, of, knowledge, that, they, produced, but, now, osiander, proclaimed, that, astronomers, might, construct, a, world, deduced, from, possibly, false, premises, thus, the, conflict, between, piconian, skepticism, and, secure, principles, for, the, science, of, the, stars, was, built, right, into, the, complex, dedicatory, apparatus, of, de, revolutionibus, itself, according, to, the, notes, of, michael, maestlin, rheticus, became, embroiled, in, a, very, bitter, wrangle, with, the, printer, rheticus, suspected, osiander, had, prefaced, the, work, if, he, knew, this, for, certain, he, declared, he, would, rough, up, the, fellow, so, violently, that, in, future, he, would, mind, his, own, business, objecting, to, the, ad, lectorem, tiedemann, giese, urged, the, nuremberg, city, council, to, issue, a, correction, but, this, was, not, done, and, the, matter, was, forgotten, jan, broscius, a, supporter, of, copernicus, also, despaired, of, the, ad, lectorem, writing, ptolemy, s, hypothesis, is, the, earth, rests, copernicus, hypothesis, is, that, the, earth, is, in, motion, can, either, therefore, be, true, indeed, osiander, deceives, much, with, that, preface, of, his, hence, someone, may, well, ask, how, is, one, to, know, which, hypothesis, is, truer, the, ptolemaic, or, the, copernican, petreius, had, sent, a, copy, to, hieronymus, schreiber, an, astronomer, from, n, rnberg, who, had, substituted, for, rheticus, as, professor, of, mathematics, in, wittenberg, while, rheticus, was, in, n, rnberg, supervising, the, printing, schreiber, who, died, in, 1547, left, in, his, copy, of, the, book, a, note, about, osiander, s, authorship, via, michael, m, stlin, this, copy, came, to, johannes, kepler, who, discovered, what, osiander, had, done, and, methodically, demonstrated, that, osiander, had, indeed, added, the, foreword, the, most, knowledgeable, astronomers, of, the, time, had, realized, that, the, foreword, was, osiander, s, doing, owen, gingerich, gives, a, slightly, different, version, kepler, knew, of, osiander, s, authorship, since, he, had, read, about, it, in, one, of, schreiber, s, annotations, in, his, copy, of, de, revolutionibus, maestlin, learned, of, the, fact, from, kepler, indeed, maestlin, perused, kepler, s, book, up, to, the, point, of, leaving, a, few, annotations, in, it, however, maestlin, already, suspected, osiander, because, he, had, bought, his, de, revolutionibus, from, the, widow, of, philipp, apian, examining, his, books, he, had, found, a, note, attributing, the, introduction, to, osiander, johannes, praetorius, 1537, 1616, who, learned, of, osiander, s, authorship, from, rheticus, during, a, visit, to, him, in, krak, w, wrote, osiander, s, name, in, the, margin, of, the, foreword, in, his, copy, of, de, revolutionibus, all, three, early, editions, of, de, revolutionibus, included, osiander, s, foreword, even, before, the, 1543, publication, of, de, revolutionibus, rumors, circulated, about, its, central, theses, in, one, of, his, tischreden, table, talks, martin, luther, is, quoted, as, saying, in, 1539, people, gave, ear, to, an, upstart, astrologer, who, strove, to, show, that, the, earth, revolves, not, the, heavens, or, the, firmament, the, sun, and, the, moon, this, fool, wishes, to, reverse, the, entire, science, of, astronomy, but, sacred, scripture, tells, us, that, joshua, commanded, the, sun, to, stand, still, and, not, the, earth, when, the, book, was, finally, published, demand, was, low, with, an, initial, print, run, of, 400, failing, to, sell, out, copernicus, had, made, the, book, extremely, technical, unreadable, to, all, but, the, most, advanced, astronomers, of, the, day, allowing, it, to, disseminate, into, their, ranks, before, stirring, great, controversy, and, like, osiander, contemporary, mathematicians, and, astronomers, encouraged, its, audience, to, view, it, as, a, useful, mathematical, model, without, necessarily, being, true, about, causes, thereby, somewhat, shielding, it, from, accusations, of, blasphemy, among, some, astronomers, the, book, at, once, took, its, place, as, a, worthy, successor, to, the, almagest, of, ptolemy, which, had, hitherto, been, the, alpha, and, omega, of, astronomers, erasmus, reinhold, hailed, the, work, in, 1542, and, by, 1551, had, developed, the, prutenic, tables, prussian, tables, latin, tabulae, prutenicae, german, preu, ische, tafeln, using, copernicus, methods, the, prutenic, tables, published, in, 1551, were, used, as, a, basis, for, the, calendar, reform, instituted, in, 1582, by, pope, gregory, xiii, they, were, also, used, by, sailors, and, maritime, explorers, whose, 15th, century, predecessors, had, used, regiomontanus, table, of, the, stars, in, england, robert, recorde, john, dee, thomas, digges, and, william, gilbert, were, among, those, who, adopted, his, position, in, germany, christian, wurstisen, christoph, rothmann, and, michael, m, stlin, the, teacher, of, johannes, kepler, in, italy, giambattista, benedetti, and, giordano, bruno, whilst, franciscus, patricius, accepted, the, rotation, of, the, earth, in, spain, rules, published, in, 1561, for, the, curriculum, of, the, university, of, salamanca, gave, students, the, choice, between, studying, ptolemy, or, copernicus, one, of, those, students, diego, de, z, iga, published, an, acceptance, of, copernican, theory, in, 1584, very, soon, nevertheless, copernicus, theory, was, attacked, with, scripture, and, with, the, common, aristotelian, proofs, in, 1549, melanchthon, luther, s, principal, lieutenant, wrote, against, copernicus, pointing, to, the, theory, s, apparent, conflict, with, scripture, and, advocating, that, severe, measures, be, taken, to, restrain, the, impiety, of, copernicans, the, works, of, copernicus, and, z, iga, the, latter, for, asserting, that, de, revolutionibus, was, compatible, with, catholic, faith, were, placed, on, the, index, of, forbidden, books, by, a, decree, of, the, sacred, congregation, of, march, 5, 1616, more, than, 70, years, after, copernicus, publication, this, holy, congregation, has, also, learned, about, the, spreading, and, acceptance, by, many, of, the, false, pythagorean, doctrine, altogether, contrary, to, the, holy, scripture, that, the, earth, moves, and, the, sun, is, motionless, which, is, also, taught, by, nicholaus, copernicus, de, revolutionibus, orbium, coelestium, and, by, diego, de, z, iga, s, in, job, therefore, in, order, that, this, opinion, may, not, creep, any, further, to, the, prejudice, of, catholic, truth, the, congregation, has, decided, that, the, books, by, nicolaus, copernicus, and, diego, de, z, iga, be, suspended, until, corrected, de, revolutionibus, was, not, formally, banned, but, merely, withdrawn, from, circulation, pending, corrections, that, would, clarify, the, theory, s, status, as, hypothesis, nine, sentences, that, represented, the, heliocentric, system, as, certain, were, to, be, omitted, or, changed, after, these, corrections, were, prepared, and, formally, approved, in, 1620, the, reading, of, the, book, was, permitted, but, the, book, was, never, reprinted, with, the, changes, and, was, available, in, catholic, jurisdictions, only, to, suitably, qualified, scholars, by, special, request, it, remained, on, the, index, until, 1758, when, pope, benedict, xiv, 1740,
