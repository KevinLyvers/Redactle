the, septuagint, s, p, tj, u, d, n, t, sep, tew, jint, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, greek, old, testament, or, the, translation, of, the, seventy, ancient, greek, romanized, h, met, phrasis, t, n, hebdom, konta, and, often, abbreviated, as, lxx, is, the, earliest, extant, greek, translation, of, the, hebrew, bible, from, the, original, hebrew, the, full, greek, title, derives, from, the, story, recorded, in, the, letter, of, aristeas, to, philocrates, that, the, laws, of, the, jews, were, translated, into, the, greek, language, at, the, request, of, ptolemy, ii, philadelphus, 285, 247, bce, by, seventy, two, hebrew, translators, six, from, each, of, the, twelve, tribes, of, israel, biblical, scholars, agree, that, the, first, five, books, of, the, hebrew, bible, were, translated, from, biblical, hebrew, into, koine, greek, by, jews, living, in, the, ptolemaic, kingdom, centred, on, the, large, community, in, alexandria, probably, in, the, early, or, middle, part, of, the, third, century, bce, the, remaining, books, were, presumably, translated, in, the, 2nd, century, bce, some, targums, translating, or, paraphrasing, the, bible, into, aramaic, were, also, made, during, the, second, temple, period, few, people, could, speak, and, even, fewer, could, read, in, the, hebrew, language, during, the, second, temple, period, koine, greek, and, aramaic, were, the, most, widely, spoken, languages, at, that, time, among, the, jewish, community, the, septuagint, therefore, satisfied, a, need, in, the, jewish, community, the, term, septuagint, is, derived, from, the, latin, phrase, vetus, testamentum, ex, versione, septuaginta, interpretum, the, old, testament, from, the, version, of, the, seventy, translators, this, phrase, in, turn, was, derived, from, the, ancient, greek, romanized, h, met, phrasis, t, n, hebdom, konta, lit, the, translation, of, the, seventy, it, was, not, until, the, time, of, augustine, of, hippo, 354, 430, ce, that, the, greek, translation, of, the, jewish, scriptures, was, called, by, the, latin, term, septuaginta, the, roman, numeral, lxx, seventy, is, commonly, used, as, an, abbreviation, in, addition, to, g, displaystyle, mathfrak, g, or, g, according, to, tradition, ptolemy, ii, philadelphus, the, greek, pharaoh, of, egypt, sent, seventy, two, hebrew, translators, six, from, each, of, the, twelve, tribes, of, israel, from, jerusalem, to, alexandria, to, translate, the, tanakh, from, biblical, hebrew, into, koine, greek, for, inclusion, in, his, library, this, narrative, is, found, in, the, possibly, pseudepigraphic, letter, of, aristeas, to, his, brother, philocrates, and, is, repeated, by, philo, of, alexandria, josephus, in, antiquities, of, the, jews, and, by, later, sources, including, augustine, of, hippo, it, is, also, found, in, the, tractate, megillah, of, the, babylonian, talmud, king, ptolemy, once, gathered, 72, elders, he, placed, them, in, 72, chambers, each, of, them, in, a, separate, one, without, revealing, to, them, why, they, were, summoned, he, entered, each, one, s, room, and, said, write, for, me, the, torah, of, moshe, your, teacher, god, put, it, in, the, heart, of, each, one, to, translate, identically, as, all, the, others, did, philo, of, alexandria, writes, that, the, number, of, scholars, was, chosen, by, selecting, six, scholars, from, each, of, the, twelve, tribes, of, israel, caution, is, needed, here, regarding, the, accuracy, of, this, statement, by, philo, of, alexandria, as, it, implies, that, the, twelve, tribes, were, still, in, existence, during, king, ptolemy, s, reign, and, that, the, ten, lost, tribes, of, the, twelve, tribes, had, not, been, forcibly, resettled, by, assyria, almost, 500, years, previously, although, not, all, the, people, of, the, ten, tribes, were, scattered, many, peoples, of, the, ten, tribes, sought, refuge, in, jerusalem, and, survived, preserving, a, remnant, of, each, tribe, and, their, lineages, jerusalem, swelled, to, five, times, its, prior, population, due, to, the, influx, of, refugees, according, to, later, rabbinic, tradition, which, considered, the, greek, translation, as, a, distortion, of, sacred, text, and, unsuitable, for, use, in, the, synagogue, the, septuagint, was, given, to, ptolemy, two, days, before, the, annual, tenth, of, tevet, fast, according, to, aristobulus, of, alexandria, s, fragment, 3, portions, of, the, law, were, translated, from, hebrew, into, greek, long, before, the, well, known, septuagint, version, he, stated, that, plato, and, pythagoras, knew, the, jewish, law, and, borrowed, from, it, in, the, preface, to, his, 1844, translation, of, the, septuagint, lancelot, charles, lee, brenton, acknowledges, that, the, jews, of, alexandria, were, likely, to, have, been, the, writers, of, the, septuagint, but, dismisses, aristeas, account, as, a, pious, fiction, instead, he, asserts, that, the, real, origin, of, the, name, septuagint, pertains, to, the, fact, that, the, earliest, version, was, forwarded, by, the, authors, to, the, jewish, sanhedrin, at, alexandria, for, editing, and, approval, the, jews, of, alexandria, celebrated, the, translation, with, an, annual, festival, on, the, island, of, pharos, where, the, lighthouse, of, alexandria, stood, the, location, where, the, translation, was, said, to, have, taken, place, during, the, festival, a, large, gathering, of, jews, along, with, some, non, jewish, visitors, would, assemble, on, the, beach, for, a, grand, picnic, the, 3rd, century, bce, is, supported, for, the, translation, of, the, pentateuch, by, a, number, of, factors, including, its, greek, being, representative, of, early, koine, greek, citations, beginning, as, early, as, the, 2nd, century, bce, and, early, manuscripts, datable, to, the, 2nd, century, bce, after, the, torah, other, books, were, translated, over, the, next, two, to, three, centuries, it, is, unclear, which, was, translated, when, or, where, some, may, have, been, translated, twice, into, different, versions, and, then, revised, the, quality, and, style, of, the, translators, varied, considerably, from, book, to, book, from, a, literal, translation, to, paraphrasing, to, an, interpretative, style, the, translation, process, of, the, septuagint, and, from, the, septuagint, into, other, versions, can, be, divided, into, several, stages, the, greek, text, was, produced, within, the, social, environment, of, hellenistic, judaism, and, completed, by, 132, bce, with, the, spread, of, early, christianity, this, septuagint, in, turn, was, rendered, into, latin, in, a, variety, of, versions, and, the, latter, collectively, known, as, the, vetus, latina, were, also, referred, to, as, the, septuagint, initially, in, alexandria, but, elsewhere, as, well, the, septuagint, also, formed, the, basis, for, the, slavonic, syriac, old, armenian, old, georgian, and, coptic, versions, of, the, christian, old, testament, the, septuagint, is, written, in, koine, greek, some, sections, contain, semiticisms, which, are, idioms, and, phrases, based, on, semitic, languages, such, as, hebrew, and, aramaic, other, books, such, as, daniel, and, proverbs, have, a, stronger, greek, influence, the, septuagint, may, also, clarify, pronunciation, of, pre, masoretic, hebrew, many, proper, nouns, are, spelled, with, greek, vowels, in, the, translation, but, contemporary, hebrew, texts, lacked, vowel, pointing, however, it, is, unlikely, that, all, biblical, hebrew, sounds, had, precise, greek, equivalents, the, septuagint, does, not, consist, of, a, single, unified, corpus, rather, it, is, a, collection, of, ancient, translations, of, the, tanakh, along, with, other, jewish, texts, that, are, now, commonly, referred, to, as, apocrypha, importantly, the, canon, of, the, hebrew, bible, was, evolving, over, the, century, or, so, in, which, the, septuagint, was, being, written, also, the, texts, were, translated, by, many, different, people, in, different, locations, at, different, times, for, different, purposes, and, often, from, different, original, hebrew, manuscripts, the, hebrew, bible, also, called, the, tanakh, has, three, parts, the, torah, law, the, nevi, im, prophets, and, the, ketuvim, writings, the, septuagint, has, four, law, history, poetry, and, prophets, the, books, of, the, apocrypha, were, inserted, at, appropriate, locations, extant, copies, of, the, septuagint, which, date, from, the, 4th, century, ce, contain, books, and, additions, not, present, in, the, hebrew, bible, as, established, in, the, jewish, canon, and, are, not, uniform, in, their, contents, according, to, some, scholars, there, is, no, evidence, that, the, septuagint, included, these, additional, books, these, copies, of, the, septuagint, include, books, known, as, anagignoskomena, in, greek, and, in, english, as, deuterocanon, derived, from, the, greek, words, for, second, canon, books, not, included, in, the, jewish, canon, these, books, are, estimated, to, have, been, written, between, 200, bce, and, 50, ce, among, them, are, the, first, two, books, of, maccabees, tobit, judith, the, wisdom, of, solomon, sirach, baruch, including, the, letter, of, jeremiah, and, additions, to, esther, and, daniel, the, septuagint, version, of, some, books, such, as, daniel, and, esther, are, longer, than, those, in, the, masoretic, text, which, were, affirmed, as, canonical, in, rabbinic, judaism, the, septuagint, book, of, jeremiah, is, shorter, than, the, masoretic, text, the, psalms, of, solomon, 1, esdras, 3, maccabees, 4, maccabees, the, letter, of, jeremiah, the, book, of, odes, the, prayer, of, manasseh, and, psalm, 151, are, included, in, some, copies, of, the, septuagint, the, septuagint, has, been, rejected, as, scriptural, by, mainstream, rabbinic, judaism, for, a, couple, of, reasons, first, the, septuagint, differs, from, the, hebrew, source, texts, in, many, cases, particularly, in, the, book, of, job, second, the, translations, appear, at, times, to, demonstrate, an, ignorance, of, hebrew, idiomatic, usage, a, particularly, noteworthy, example, of, this, phenomenon, is, found, in, isaiah, 7, 14, in, which, the, hebrew, word, alm, h, which, translates, into, english, as, young, woman, is, translated, into, the, koine, greek, as, parthenos, which, translates, into, english, as, virgin, the, septuagint, became, synonymous, with, the, greek, old, testament, a, christian, canon, incorporating, the, books, of, the, hebrew, canon, with, additional, texts, although, the, catholic, church, and, the, eastern, orthodox, church, include, most, of, the, books, in, the, septuagint, in, their, canons, protestant, churches, usually, do, not, after, the, reformation, many, protestant, bibles, began, to, follow, the, jewish, canon, and, exclude, the, additional, texts, which, came, to, be, called, the, apocrypha, as, noncanonical, the, apocrypha, are, included, under, a, separate, heading, in, the, king, james, version, of, the, bible, all, the, books, in, western, old, testament, biblical, canons, are, found, in, the, septuagint, although, the, order, does, not, always, coincide, with, the, western, book, order, the, septuagint, order, is, evident, in, the, earliest, christian, bibles, which, were, written, during, the, fourth, century, some, books, which, are, set, apart, in, the, masoretic, text, are, grouped, together, the, books, of, samuel, and, the, books, of, kings, are, one, four, part, book, entitled, of, reigns, in, the, septuagint, the, books, of, chronicles, known, collectively, as, of, things, left, out, supplement, reigns, the, septuagint, organizes, the, minor, prophets, in, its, twelve, part, book, of, twelve, some, ancient, scriptures, are, found, in, the, septuagint, but, not, in, the, hebrew, bible, the, books, are, tobit, judith, the, wisdom, of, solomon, wisdom, of, jesus, son, of, sirach, baruch, and, the, letter, of, jeremiah, which, became, chapter, six, of, baruch, in, the, vulgate, the, additions, to, daniel, the, prayer, of, azarias, the, song, of, the, three, children, susanna, and, bel, and, the, dragon, the, additions, to, esther, 1, maccabees, 2, maccabees, 3, maccabees, 4, maccabees, 1, esdras, odes, including, the, prayer, of, manasseh, the, psalms, of, solomon, and, psalm, 151, fragments, of, deuterocanonical, books, in, hebrew, are, among, the, dead, sea, scrolls, found, at, qumran, sirach, whose, text, in, hebrew, was, already, known, from, the, cairo, geniza, has, been, found, in, two, scrolls, 2qsir, or, 2q18, 11qps, a, or, 11q5, in, hebrew, another, hebrew, scroll, of, sirach, has, been, found, in, masada, massir, 597, five, fragments, from, the, book, of, tobit, have, been, found, in, qumran, four, written, in, aramaic, and, one, written, in, hebrew, papyri, 4q, nos, 196, 200, 636, psalm, 151, appears, with, a, number, of, canonical, and, non, canonical, psalms, in, the, dead, sea, scroll, 11qps, a, also, known, as, 11q5, a, first, century, ce, scroll, discovered, in, 1956, the, scroll, contains, two, short, hebrew, psalms, which, scholars, agree, were, the, basis, for, psalm, 151, 585, 586, the, canonical, acceptance, of, these, books, varies, by, christian, tradition, it, is, unclear, to, what, extent, alexandrian, jews, accepted, the, authority, of, the, septuagint, manuscripts, of, the, septuagint, have, been, found, among, the, dead, sea, scrolls, and, were, thought, to, have, been, in, use, among, various, jewish, sects, at, the, time, several, factors, led, most, jews, to, abandon, the, septuagint, around, the, second, century, ce, the, earliest, gentile, christians, used, the, septuagint, out, of, necessity, since, it, was, the, only, greek, version, of, the, bible, and, most, if, not, all, of, these, early, non, jewish, christians, could, not, read, hebrew, the, association, of, the, septuagint, with, a, rival, religion, may, have, made, it, suspect, in, the, eyes, of, the, newer, generation, of, jews, and, jewish, scholars, jews, instead, used, hebrew, or, aramaic, targum, manuscripts, later, compiled, by, the, masoretes, and, authoritative, aramaic, translations, such, as, those, of, onkelos, and, rabbi, yonathan, ben, uziel, perhaps, most, significant, for, the, septuagint, as, distinct, from, other, greek, versions, was, that, the, septuagint, began, to, lose, jewish, sanction, after, differences, between, it, and, contemporary, hebrew, scriptures, were, discovered, even, greek, speaking, jews, tended, to, prefer, other, jewish, versions, in, greek, such, as, the, translation, by, aquila, which, seemed, to, be, more, concordant, with, contemporary, hebrew, texts, the, early, christian, church, used, the, greek, texts, since, greek, was, a, lingua, franca, of, the, eastern, parts, of, the, roman, empire, at, the, time, and, the, language, of, the, greco, roman, church, while, aramaic, was, the, language, of, syriac, christianity, the, relationship, between, the, apostolic, use, of, the, septuagint, and, the, hebrew, texts, is, complicated, although, the, septuagint, seems, to, have, been, a, major, source, for, the, apostles, it, is, not, the, only, one, st, jerome, offered, for, example, matthew, 2, 15, and, 2, 23, john, 19, 37, john, 7, 38, and, 1, corinthians, 2, 9, as, examples, found, in, hebrew, texts, but, not, in, the, septuagint, matthew, 2, 23, is, not, present, in, current, masoretic, tradition, either, according, to, jerome, however, it, was, in, isaiah, 11, 1, the, new, testament, writers, freely, used, the, greek, translation, when, citing, the, jewish, scriptures, or, quoting, jesus, doing, so, implying, that, jesus, his, apostles, and, their, followers, considered, it, reliable, in, the, early, christian, church, the, presumption, that, the, septuagint, was, translated, by, jews, before, the, time, of, christ, and, that, it, lends, itself, more, to, a, christological, interpretation, than, 2nd, century, hebrew, texts, in, certain, places, was, taken, as, evidence, that, jews, had, changed, the, hebrew, text, in, a, way, that, made, it, less, christological, irenaeus, writes, about, isaiah, 7, 14, that, the, septuagint, clearly, identifies, a, virgin, greek, bethulah, in, hebrew, who, would, conceive, the, word, almah, in, the, hebrew, text, was, according, to, irenaeus, interpreted, by, theodotion, and, aquila, jewish, converts, as, a, young, woman, who, would, conceive, again, according, to, irenaeus, the, ebionites, used, this, to, claim, that, joseph, was, the, biological, father, of, jesus, to, him, that, was, heresy, facilitated, by, late, anti, christian, alterations, of, the, scripture, in, hebrew, as, evident, by, the, older, pre, christian, septuagint, jerome, broke, with, church, tradition, translating, most, of, the, old, testament, of, his, vulgate, from, hebrew, rather, than, greek, his, choice, was, sharply, criticized, by, augustine, his, contemporary, although, jerome, argued, for, the, superiority, of, the, hebrew, texts, in, correcting, the, septuagint, on, philological, and, theological, grounds, because, he, was, accused, of, heresy, he, also, acknowledged, the, septuagint, texts, acceptance, of, jerome, s, version, increased, and, it, displaced, the, septuagint, s, old, latin, translations, the, eastern, orthodox, church, prefers, to, use, the, septuagint, as, the, basis, for, translating, the, old, testament, into, other, languages, and, uses, the, untranslated, septuagint, where, greek, is, the, liturgical, language, critical, translations, of, the, old, testament, which, use, the, masoretic, text, as, their, basis, consult, the, septuagint, and, other, versions, to, reconstruct, the, meaning, of, the, hebrew, text, when, it, is, unclear, corrupted, or, ambiguous, according, to, the, new, jerusalem, bible, foreword, only, when, this, the, masoretic, text, presents, insuperable, difficulties, have, emendations, or, other, versions, such, as, the, lxx, been, used, the, translator, s, preface, to, the, new, international, version, reads, the, translators, also, consulted, the, more, important, early, versions, including, the, septuagint, readings, from, these, versions, were, occasionally, followed, where, the, mt, seemed, doubtful, modern, scholarship, holds, that, the, septuagint, was, written, from, the, 3rd, through, the, 1st, centuries, bce, but, nearly, all, attempts, at, dating, specific, books, except, for, the, pentateuch, early, to, mid, 3rd, century, bce, are, tentative, later, jewish, revisions, and, recensions, of, the, greek, against, the, hebrew, are, well, attested, the, best, known, are, aquila, 128, ce, symmachus, and, theodotion, these, three, to, varying, degrees, are, more, literal, renderings, of, their, contemporary, hebrew, scriptures, compared, to, the, old, greek, the, original, septuagint, modern, scholars, consider, one, or, more, of, the, three, to, be, new, greek, versions, of, the, hebrew, bible, although, much, of, origen, s, hexapla, a, six, version, critical, edition, of, the, hebrew, bible, is, lost, several, compilations, of, fragments, are, available, origen, kept, a, column, for, the, old, greek, the, septuagint, which, included, readings, from, all, the, greek, versions, in, a, critical, apparatus, with, diacritical, marks, indicating, to, which, version, each, line, gr, belonged, perhaps, the, hexapla, was, never, copied, in, its, entirety, but, origen, s, combined, text, was, copied, frequently, eventually, without, the, editing, marks, and, the, older, uncombined, text, of, the, septuagint, was, neglected, the, combined, text, was, the, first, major, christian, recension, of, the, septuagint, often, called, the, hexaplar, recension, two, other, major, recensions, were, identified, in, the, century, following, origen, by, jerome, who, attributed, these, to, lucian, the, lucianic, or, antiochene, recension, and, hesychius, the, hesychian, or, alexandrian, recension, the, oldest, manuscripts, of, the, septuagint, include, 2nd, century, bce, fragments, of, leviticus, and, deuteronomy, rahlfs, nos, 801, 819, and, 957, and, 1st, century, bce, fragments, of, genesis, exodus, leviticus, numbers, deuteronomy, and, the, twelve, minor, prophets, alfred, rahlfs, nos, 802, 803, 805, 848, 942, and, 943, relatively, complete, manuscripts, of, the, septuagint, postdate, the, hexaplar, recension, and, include, the, fourth, century, ce, codex, vaticanus, and, the, fifth, century, codex, alexandrinus, these, are, the, oldest, surviving, nearly, complete, manuscripts, of, the, old, testament, in, any, language, the, oldest, extant, complete, hebrew, texts, date, to, about, 600, years, later, from, the, first, half, of, the, 10th, century, the, 4th, century, codex, sinaiticus, also, partially, survives, with, many, old, testament, texts, 73, 198, the, jewish, and, later, christian, revisions, and, recensions, are, largely, responsible, for, the, divergence, of, the, codices, the, codex, marchalianus, is, another, notable, manuscript, the, text, of, the, septuagint, is, generally, close, to, that, of, the, masoretes, and, vulgate, genesis, 4, 1, 6, is, identical, in, the, septuagint, vulgate, and, the, masoretic, text, and, genesis, 4, 8, to, the, end, of, the, chapter, is, the, same, there, is, only, one, noticeable, difference, in, that, chapter, at, 4, 7, the, differences, between, the, septuagint, and, the, mt, fall, into, four, categories, the, biblical, manuscripts, found, in, qumran, commonly, known, as, the, dead, sea, scrolls, dss, have, prompted, comparisons, of, the, texts, associated, with, the, hebrew, bible, including, the, septuagint, emanuel, tov, editor, of, the, translated, scrolls, identifies, five, broad, variants, of, dss, texts, the, textual, sources, present, a, variety, of, readings, bastiaan, van, elderen, compares, three, variations, of, deuteronomy, 32, 43, the, song, of, moses, the, text, of, all, print, editions, is, derived, from, the, recensions, of, origen, lucian, or, hesychius, one, of, the, main, challenges, faced, by, translators, during, their, work, emanated, from, the, need, to, implement, appropriate, greek, forms, for, various, onomastic, terms, used, in, the, hebrew, bible, most, onomastic, terms, toponyms, anthroponyms, of, the, hebrew, bible, were, rendered, by, corresponding, greek, terms, that, were, similar, in, form, and, sounding, with, some, notable, exceptions, one, of, those, exceptions, was, related, to, a, specific, group, of, onomastic, terms, for, the, region, of, aram, and, ancient, arameans, influenced, by, greek, onomastic, terminology, translators, decided, to, adopt, greek, custom, of, using, syrian, labels, as, designations, for, arameans, their, lands, and, language, thus, abandoning, endonymic, native, terms, that, were, used, in, the, hebrew, bible, in, the, greek, translation, the, region, of, aram, was, commonly, labeled, as, syria, while, arameans, were, labeled, as, syrians, such, adoption, and, implementation, of, terms, that, were, foreign, exonymic, had, far, reaching, influence, on, later, terminology, related, to, arameans, and, their, lands, since, the, same, terminology, was, reflected, in, later, latin, and, other, translations, of, the, septuagint, including, the, english, translation, reflecting, on, those, problems, american, orientalist, robert, w, rogers, d, 1930, noted, in, 1921, it, is, most, unfortunate, that, syria, and, syrians, ever, came, into, the, english, versions, it, should, always, be, aram, and, the, aramaeans, the, first, english, translation, which, excluded, the, apocrypha, was, charles, thomson, s, in, 1808, which, was, revised, and, enlarged, by, c, a, muses, in, 1954, and, published, by, the, falcon, s, wing, press, the, septuagint, with, apocrypha, greek, and, english, was, translated, by, lancelot, brenton, in, 1854, it, is, the, traditional, translation, and, most, of, the, time, since, its, publication, it, has, been, the, only, one, readily, available, it, has, also, been, continually, in, print, the, translation, based, on, the, codex, vaticanus, contains, the, greek, and, english, texts, in, parallel,
