the, analects, also, known, as, the, sayings, of, confucius, is, an, ancient, chinese, philosophical, text, composed, of, sayings, and, ideas, attributed, to, confucius, and, his, contemporaries, traditionally, believed, to, have, been, compiled, by, his, followers, the, consensus, among, scholars, is, that, large, portions, of, the, text, were, composed, during, the, warring, states, period, 475, 221, bc, and, that, the, work, achieved, its, final, form, during, the, mid, han, dynasty, 206, bc, 220, ad, during, the, early, han, the, analects, was, merely, considered, to, be, a, commentary, on, the, five, classics, however, by, the, dynasty, s, end, the, status, of, the, analects, had, grown, to, being, among, the, central, texts, of, confucianism, during, the, late, song, dynasty, 960, 1279, ad, the, importance, of, the, analects, as, a, chinese, philosophy, work, was, raised, above, that, of, the, older, five, classics, and, it, was, recognized, as, one, of, the, four, books, the, analects, has, been, one, of, the, most, widely, read, and, studied, books, in, china, for, more, than, two, millennia, its, ideas, continue, to, have, a, substantial, influence, on, east, asian, thought, and, values, confucius, believed, that, the, welfare, of, a, country, depended, on, the, moral, cultivation, of, its, people, beginning, from, the, nation, s, leadership, he, believed, that, individuals, could, begin, to, cultivate, an, all, encompassing, sense, of, virtue, through, ren, and, that, the, most, basic, step, to, cultivating, ren, was, filial, piety, primarily, the, devotion, to, one, s, parents, and, older, siblings, he, taught, that, one, s, individual, desires, do, not, need, to, be, suppressed, but, that, people, should, be, educated, to, reconcile, their, desires, via, li, rituals, and, forms, of, propriety, through, which, people, could, demonstrate, their, respect, for, others, and, their, responsible, roles, in, society, confucius, also, believed, that, a, ruler, s, sense, of, de, or, virtue, was, his, primary, prerequisite, for, leadership, his, primary, goal, in, educating, his, students, was, to, produce, ethically, well, cultivated, men, who, would, carry, themselves, with, gravity, speak, correctly, and, demonstrate, consummate, integrity, in, all, things, according, to, ban, gu, writing, in, the, book, of, han, the, analects, originated, as, individual, records, kept, by, confucius, s, disciples, of, conversations, between, the, master, and, them, which, were, then, collected, and, jointly, edited, by, the, disciples, after, confucius, death, in, 479, bc, the, work, was, titled, lunyu, during, the, han, dynasty, in, this, context, the, character, for, lun, means, discuss, or, dispute, while, yu, means, speech, or, sayings, lunyu, therefore, may, mean, edited, conversations, or, selected, speeches, thus, analects, this, broadly, forms, the, traditional, account, of, the, genesis, of, the, work, accepted, by, later, generations, of, scholars, for, example, the, song, dynasty, neo, confucian, scholar, zhu, xi, stated, that, analects, is, the, records, of, confucius, s, first, and, second, generation, pupils, this, traditional, view, has, been, challenged, by, chinese, japanese, and, western, scholars, the, qing, dynasty, philologist, cui, shu, argued, on, linguistic, ground, that, the, last, five, books, were, produced, much, later, than, the, rest, of, the, work, it, jinsai, claimed, that, because, of, differences, he, saw, in, patterns, of, language, and, content, in, the, analects, a, distinction, in, authorship, should, be, made, between, the, upper, analects, books, 1, 10, and, lower, analects, books, 11, 20, arthur, waley, speculated, that, books, 3, 9, represent, the, earliest, parts, of, the, book, e, bruce, brooks, and, a, taeko, brooks, reviewed, previous, theories, of, the, chapters, creation, and, produced, a, four, stratum, theory, of, the, text, s, creation, many, modern, scholars, now, believe, that, the, work, was, compiled, over, a, period, of, around, two, hundred, years, some, time, during, the, warring, states, period, 476, 221, bc, with, some, questioning, the, authenticity, of, some, of, the, sayings, because, no, manuscript, dated, earlier, than, c, 70, bc, has, been, discovered, and, because, the, analects, was, not, referred, to, by, name, in, any, existing, source, before, the, early, han, dynasty, some, scholars, have, proposed, dates, as, late, as, 140, bc, for, the, text, s, final, compilation, regardless, of, how, early, the, text, of, the, analects, existed, most, analects, scholars, believe, that, by, the, early, han, dynasty, 206, bc, 220, ad, the, book, was, widely, known, and, transmitted, throughout, china, in, a, mostly, complete, form, and, that, the, book, acquired, its, final, complete, form, during, the, han, dynasty, however, han, dynasty, writer, wang, chong, claimed, that, all, copies, of, the, analects, that, existed, during, the, han, dynasty, were, incomplete, and, formed, only, a, part, of, a, much, larger, work, this, is, supported, by, the, fact, that, a, larger, collection, of, confucius, s, teachings, did, exist, in, the, warring, states, period, than, has, been, preserved, directly, in, the, analects, 75, of, confucius, s, sayings, cited, by, his, second, generation, student, mencius, do, not, exist, in, the, received, text, of, the, analects, according, to, the, han, dynasty, scholar, liu, xiang, there, were, two, versions, of, the, analects, that, existed, at, the, beginning, of, the, han, dynasty, the, lu, version, and, the, qi, version, the, lu, version, contained, twenty, chapters, and, the, qi, version, contained, twenty, two, chapters, including, two, chapters, not, found, in, the, lu, version, of, the, twenty, chapters, that, both, versions, had, in, common, the, lu, version, had, more, passages, each, version, had, its, own, masters, schools, and, transmitters, in, the, reign, of, emperor, jing, of, han, r, 157, 141, bc, a, third, old, text, version, was, discovered, hidden, in, a, wall, of, the, home, believed, at, the, time, to, have, been, confucius, s, when, the, home, was, in, the, process, of, being, destroyed, by, king, gong, of, lu, r, 153, 128, bc, in, order, to, expand, the, king, s, palace, the, new, version, did, not, contain, the, two, extra, chapters, found, in, the, qi, version, but, it, split, one, chapter, found, in, the, lu, and, qi, versions, in, two, so, it, had, twenty, one, chapters, and, the, order, of, the, chapters, was, different, the, old, text, version, got, its, name, because, it, was, written, in, characters, not, used, since, the, earlier, warring, states, period, before, 221, bc, when, it, was, assumed, to, have, been, hidden, according, to, the, han, dynasty, scholar, huan, tan, the, old, text, version, had, four, hundred, characters, different, from, the, lu, version, from, which, the, received, text, is, mostly, based, and, it, seriously, differed, from, the, lu, version, in, 27, places, of, these, twenty, seven, differences, the, received, text, only, agrees, with, the, old, text, version, in, two, places, over, a, century, later, zhang, yu, the, tutor, of, the, analects, to, emperor, cheng, of, han, d, 5, bc, synthesized, the, lu, and, qi, versions, by, taking, the, lu, version, as, authoritative, and, selectively, adding, sections, from, the, qi, version, and, produced, a, composite, text, of, the, analects, known, as, the, zhang, hou, lun, this, text, was, recognized, by, zhang, yu, s, contemporaries, and, by, subsequent, han, scholars, as, superior, to, either, individual, version, and, is, the, text, that, is, recognized, as, the, analects, today, no, complete, copies, of, either, the, lu, version, or, the, old, text, version, of, the, analects, exist, today, though, fragments, of, the, old, text, version, were, discovered, at, dunhuang, the, qi, version, was, lost, for, about, 1, 800, years, but, was, rediscovered, during, the, excavation, of, the, tomb, of, marquis, of, haihun, in, 2011, before, the, late, twentieth, century, the, oldest, existing, copy, of, the, analects, known, to, scholars, was, found, in, the, stone, classics, of, the, xinping, era, a, copy, of, the, confucian, classics, written, in, stone, in, the, old, eastern, capital, of, luoyang, c, 175, ad, archaeologists, have, since, discovered, two, handwritten, copies, of, the, analects, that, were, written, c, 50, bc, during, the, western, han, dynasty, they, are, known, as, the, dingzhou, analects, and, the, pyongyang, analects, after, the, location, of, the, tombs, in, which, they, were, found, the, dingzhou, analects, was, discovered, in, 1973, but, no, transcription, of, its, contents, was, published, until, 1997, the, pyongyang, analects, was, discovered, in, 1992, academic, access, to, the, pyongyang, analects, has, been, highly, restricted, and, no, academic, study, on, it, was, published, until, 2009, the, dingzhou, analects, was, damaged, in, a, fire, shortly, after, it, was, entombed, in, the, han, dynasty, it, was, further, damaged, in, an, earthquake, shortly, after, it, was, recovered, and, the, surviving, text, is, just, under, half, the, size, of, the, received, text, of, the, analects, of, the, sections, that, survive, the, dingzhou, analects, is, shorter, than, the, received, analects, implying, that, the, text, of, the, analects, was, still, in, the, process, of, expansion, when, the, dingzhou, analects, was, entombed, there, was, evidence, that, additions, may, have, been, made, to, the, manuscript, after, it, had, been, completed, indicating, that, the, writer, may, have, become, aware, of, at, least, one, other, version, of, the, analects, and, included, extra, material, for, the, sake, of, completeness, the, content, of, the, pyongyang, analects, is, similar, to, the, dingzhou, analects, because, of, the, secrecy, and, isolationism, of, the, north, korean, government, only, a, very, cursory, study, of, it, has, been, made, available, to, international, scholars, and, its, contents, are, not, completely, known, outside, of, north, korea, scholars, do, not, agree, about, whether, either, the, dingzhou, analects, or, the, pyongyang, analects, represent, the, lu, version, the, qi, version, the, old, text, version, or, a, different, version, that, was, independent, of, these, three, traditions, to, date, the, oldest, extant, manuscript, of, the, analects, are, the, discovered, texts, found, in, the, haihunhou, tomb, in, 2011, the, haihunhou, analects, circulated, at, least, seventeen, years, before, the, dingzhou, and, pyongyang, ones, during, most, of, the, han, period, the, analects, was, not, considered, one, of, the, principal, texts, of, confucianism, during, the, reign, of, han, wudi, 141, 87, bc, when, the, chinese, government, began, promoting, confucian, studies, only, the, five, classics, were, considered, by, the, government, to, be, canonical, jing, they, were, considered, confucian, because, confucius, was, assumed, to, have, partially, written, edited, and, or, transmitted, them, the, analects, was, considered, secondary, as, it, was, thought, to, be, merely, a, collection, of, confucius, s, oral, commentary, zhuan, on, the, five, classics, the, political, importance, and, popularity, of, confucius, and, confucianism, grew, throughout, the, han, dynasty, and, by, the, eastern, han, the, analects, was, widely, read, by, schoolchildren, and, anyone, aspiring, to, literacy, and, often, read, before, the, five, classics, themselves, during, the, eastern, han, the, heir, apparent, was, provided, a, tutor, specifically, to, teach, him, the, analects, the, growing, importance, of, the, analects, was, recognized, when, the, five, classics, was, expanded, to, the, seven, classics, the, five, classics, plus, the, analects, and, the, classic, of, filial, piety, and, its, status, as, one, of, the, central, texts, of, confucianism, continued, to, grow, until, the, late, song, dynasty, 960, 1279, when, it, was, identified, and, promoted, as, one, of, the, four, books, by, zhu, xi, and, generally, accepted, as, being, more, insightful, than, the, older, five, classics, the, writing, style, of, the, analects, also, inspired, future, confucian, writers, for, example, the, sui, dynasty, writer, wang, tong, s, explanation, of, the, mean, was, purposely, written, to, emulate, the, style, of, the, analects, a, practice, praised, by, the, ming, dynasty, philosopher, wang, yangming, since, the, han, dynasty, chinese, readers, have, interpreted, the, analects, by, reading, scholars, commentaries, on, the, book, there, have, been, many, commentaries, on, the, analects, since, the, han, dynasty, but, the, two, which, have, been, most, influential, have, been, the, collected, explanations, of, the, analects, lunyu, jijie, by, he, yan, c, 195, 249, and, several, colleagues, and, the, collected, commentaries, of, the, analects, lunyu, jizhu, by, zhu, xi, 1130, 1200, in, his, work, he, yan, collected, selected, summarized, and, rationalized, what, he, believed, to, be, the, most, insightful, of, all, preceding, commentaries, on, the, analects, which, had, been, produced, by, earlier, han, and, wei, dynasty, 220, 265, ad, scholars, he, yan, s, personal, interpretation, of, the, lunyu, was, guided, by, his, belief, that, daoism, and, confucianism, complemented, each, other, so, that, by, studying, both, in, a, correct, manner, a, scholar, could, arrive, at, a, single, unified, truth, arguing, for, the, ultimate, compatibility, of, daoist, and, confucian, teachings, he, argued, that, laozi, was, in, agreement, with, the, sage, sic, the, explanations, that, was, written, in, 248, ad, was, quickly, recognized, as, authoritative, and, remained, the, standard, guide, to, interpreting, the, analects, for, nearly, 1, 000, years, until, the, early, yuan, dynasty, 1271, 1368, it, is, the, oldest, complete, commentary, on, the, analects, that, still, exists, he, yan, s, commentary, was, eventually, displaced, as, the, definitive, standard, commentary, by, zhu, xi, s, commentary, zhu, xi, s, work, also, brought, together, the, commentaries, of, earlier, scholars, mostly, from, the, song, dynasty, along, with, his, own, interpretations, zhu, s, work, took, part, in, the, context, of, a, period, of, renewed, interest, in, confucian, studies, in, which, chinese, scholars, were, interested, in, producing, a, single, correct, intellectual, orthodoxy, that, would, save, chinese, traditions, and, protect, them, from, foreign, influences, and, in, which, scholars, were, increasingly, interested, in, metaphysical, speculation, in, his, commentary, zhu, made, a, great, effort, to, interpret, the, analects, by, using, theories, elaborated, in, the, other, four, books, something, that, he, yan, had, not, done, zhu, attempted, to, give, an, added, coherence, and, unity, to, the, message, of, the, analects, demonstrating, that, the, individual, books, of, the, confucian, canon, gave, meaning, to, the, whole, just, as, the, whole, of, the, canon, gave, meaning, to, its, parts, in, his, preface, zhu, xi, stated, he, analects, and, the, mencius, are, the, most, important, works, for, students, pursuing, the, way, the, words, of, the, analects, are, all, inclusive, what, they, teach, is, nothing, but, the, essentials, of, preserving, the, mind, and, cultivating, nature, from, the, first, publication, of, the, commentaries, zhu, continued, to, refine, his, interpretation, for, the, last, thirty, years, of, his, life, in, the, fourteenth, century, the, ming, state, endorsed, zhu, s, commentary, until, 1905, it, was, read, and, memorized, along, with, the, analects, by, all, chinese, aspiring, to, literacy, and, employment, as, government, officials, very, few, reliable, sources, about, confucius, exist, besides, that, of, the, analects, the, principal, biography, available, to, historians, is, included, in, sima, qian, s, records, of, the, grand, historian, but, because, the, history, contains, a, significant, amount, of, material, unverifiable, in, other, sources, and, possibly, legendary, the, biographical, material, on, confucius, found, in, the, analects, makes, the, analects, arguably, the, most, reliable, source, of, biographical, information, about, confucius, confucius, viewed, himself, as, a, transmitter, of, social, and, political, traditions, originating, in, the, early, zhou, dynasty, c, 1000, 800, bc, and, claimed, not, to, have, originated, anything, 7, 1, but, confucius, s, social, and, political, ideals, were, not, popular, in, his, time, confucius, discussions, on, the, nature, of, the, supernatural, 3, 12, 6, 20, 11, 11, indicate, his, belief, that, while, ghosts, and, spirits, should, be, respected, they, are, best, kept, at, a, distance, instead, human, beings, should, base, their, values, and, social, ideals, on, moral, philosophy, tradition, and, a, natural, love, for, others, confucius, social, philosophy, largely, depended, on, the, cultivation, of, ren, by, every, individual, in, a, community, later, confucian, philosophers, explained, ren, as, the, quality, of, having, a, kind, manner, similar, to, the, english, words, humane, altruistic, or, benevolent, but, of, the, sixty, instances, in, which, confucius, discusses, ren, in, the, analects, very, few, have, these, later, meanings, confucius, instead, used, the, term, ren, to, describe, an, extremely, general, and, all, encompassing, state, of, virtue, one, which, no, living, person, had, attained, completely, this, use, of, the, term, ren, is, peculiar, to, the, analects, throughout, the, analects, confucius, s, students, frequently, request, that, confucius, define, ren, and, give, examples, of, people, who, embody, it, but, confucius, generally, responds, indirectly, to, his, students, questions, instead, offering, illustrations, and, examples, of, behaviours, that, are, associated, with, ren, and, explaining, how, a, person, could, achieve, it, according, to, confucius, a, person, with, a, well, cultivated, sense, of, ren, would, speak, carefully, and, modestly, 12, 3, be, resolute, and, firm, 12, 20, courageous, 14, 4, free, from, worry, unhappiness, and, insecurity, 9, 28, 6, 21, moderate, their, desires, and, return, to, propriety, 12, 1, be, respectful, tolerant, diligent, trustworthy, and, kind, 17, 6, and, love, others, 12, 22, confucius, recognized, his, followers, disappointment, that, he, would, not, give, them, a, more, comprehensive, definition, of, ren, but, assured, them, that, he, was, sharing, all, that, he, could, 7, 24, to, confucius, the, cultivation, of, ren, involved, depreciating, oneself, through, modesty, while, avoiding, artful, speech, and, ingratiating, manners, that, would, create, a, false, impression, of, one, s, own, character, 1, 3, confucius, said, that, those, who, had, cultivated, ren, could, be, distinguished, by, their, being, simple, in, manner, and, slow, of, speech, he, believed, that, people, could, cultivate, their, sense, of, ren, through, exercising, the, inverted, golden, rule, do, not, do, to, others, what, you, would, not, like, done, to, yourself, a, man, with, ren, desiring, to, establish, himself, helps, others, establish, themselves, desiring, to, succeed, himself, helps, others, to, succeed, 12, 2, 6, 28, confucius, taught, that, the, ability, of, people, to, imagine, and, project, themselves, into, the, places, of, others, was, a, crucial, quality, for, the, pursuit, of, moral, self, cultivation, 4, 15, see, also, 5, 12, 6, 30, 15, 24, confucius, regarded, the, exercise, of, devotion, to, one, s, parents, and, older, siblings, as, the, simplest, most, basic, way, to, cultivate, ren, 1, 2, confucius, believed, that, ren, could, best, be, cultivated, by, those, who, had, already, learned, self, discipline, and, that, self, discipline, was, best, learned, by, practicing, and, cultivating, one, s, understanding, of, li, rituals, and, forms, of, propriety, through, which, people, demonstrate, their, respect, for, others, and, their, responsible, roles, in, society, 3, 3, confucius, said, that, one, s, understanding, of, li, should, inform, everything, that, one, says, and, does, 12, 1, he, believed, that, subjecting, oneself, to, li, did, not, mean, suppressing, one, s, desires, but, learning, to, reconcile, them, with, the, needs, of, one, s, family, and, broader, community, by, leading, individuals, to, express, their, desires, within, the, context, of, social, responsibility, confucius, and, his, followers, taught, that, the, public, cultivation, of, li, was, the, basis, of, a, well, ordered, society, 2, 3, confucius, taught, his, students, that, an, important, aspect, of, li, was, observing, the, practical, social, differences, that, exist, between, people, in, daily, life, in, confucian, philosophy, these, five, relationships, include, ruler, to, ruled, father, to, son, husband, to, wife, elder, brother, to, younger, brother, and, friend, to, friend, ren, and, li, have, a, special, relationship, in, the, analects, li, manages, one, s, relationship, with, one, s, family, and, close, community, while, ren, is, practiced, broadly, and, informs, one, s, interactions, with, all, people, confucius, did, not, believe, that, ethical, self, cultivation, meant, unquestioned, loyalty, to, an, evil, ruler, he, argued, that, the, demands, of, ren, and, li, meant, that, rulers, could, oppress, their, subjects, only, at, their, own, peril, you, may, rob, the, three, armies, of, their, commander, but, you, cannot, deprive, the, humblest, peasant, of, his, opinion, 9, 26, confucius, said, that, a, morally, well, cultivated, individual, would, regard, his, devotion, to, loving, others, as, a, mission, for, which, he, would, be, willing, to, die, 15, 8, confucius, political, beliefs, were, rooted, in, his, belief, that, a, good, ruler, would, be, self, disciplined, would, govern, his, subjects, through, education, and, by, his, own, example, and, would, seek, to, correct, his, subjects, with, love, and, concern, rather, than, punishment, and, coercion, if, the, people, be, led, by, laws, and, uniformity, among, them, be, sought, by, punishments, they, will, try, to, escape, punishment, and, have, no, sense, of, shame, if, they, are, led, by, virtue, and, uniformity, sought, among, them, through, the, practice, of, ritual, propriety, they, will, possess, a, sense, of, shame, and, come, to, you, of, their, own, accord, 2, 3, see, also, 13, 6, confucius, political, theories, were, directly, contradictory, to, the, legalistic, political, orientations, of, china, s, rulers, and, he, failed, to, popularize, his, ideals, among, china, s, leaders, within, his, own, lifetime, confucius, believed, that, the, social, chaos, of, his, time, was, largely, due, to, china, s, ruling, elite, aspiring, to, and, claiming, titles, of, which, they, were, unworthy, when, the, ruler, of, the, large, state, of, qi, asked, confucius, about, the, principles, of, good, government, confucius, responded, good, government, consists, in, the, ruler, being, a, ruler, the, minister, being, a, minister, the, father, being, a, father, and, the, son, being, a, son, 12, 11, the, analysis, of, the, need, to, raise, officials, behavior, to, reflect, the, way, that, they, identify, and, describe, themselves, is, known, as, the, rectification, of, names, and, he, stated, that, the, rectification, of, names, should, be, the, first, responsibility, of, a, ruler, upon, taking, office, 13, 3, confucius, believed, that, because, the, ruler, was, the, model, for, all, who, were, under, him, in, society, the, rectification, of, names, had, to, begin, with, the, ruler, and, that, afterwards, others, would, change, to, imitate, him, 12, 19, confucius, judged, a, good, ruler, by, his, possession, of, de, virtue, a, sort, of, moral, force, that, allows, those, in, power, to, rule, and, gain, the, loyalty, of, others, without, the, need, for, physical, coercion, 2, 1, confucius, said, that, one, of, the, most, important, ways, that, a, ruler, cultivates, his, sense, of, de, is, through, a, devotion, to, the, correct, practices, of, li, examples, of, rituals, identified, by, confucius, as, important, to, cultivate, a, ruler, s, de, include, sacrificial, rites, held, at, ancestral, temples, to, express, thankfulness, and, humility, ceremonies, of, enfeoffment, toasting, and, gift, exchanges, that, bound, nobility, in, complex, hierarchical, relationships, of, obligation, and, indebtedness, and, acts, of, formal, politeness, and, decorum, i, e, bowing, and, yielding, that, identify, the, performers, as, morally, well, cultivated, the, importance, of, education, and, study, is, a, fundamental, theme, of, the, analects, for, confucius, a, good, student, respects, and, learns, from, the, words, and, deeds, of, his, teacher, and, a,
