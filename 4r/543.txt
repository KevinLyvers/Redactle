whole, objects, painting, is, an, important, form, of, visual, art, bringing, in, elements, such, as, drawing, composition, gesture, narration, and, abstraction, paintings, can, be, naturalistic, and, representational, as, in, still, life, and, landscape, painting, photographic, abstract, narrative, symbolistic, as, in, symbolist, art, emotive, as, in, expressionism, or, political, in, nature, as, in, artivism, a, portion, of, the, history, of, painting, in, both, eastern, and, western, art, is, dominated, by, religious, art, examples, of, this, kind, of, painting, range, from, artwork, depicting, mythological, figures, on, pottery, to, biblical, scenes, on, the, sistine, chapel, ceiling, to, scenes, from, the, life, of, buddha, or, other, images, of, eastern, religious, origin, the, oldest, known, paintings, are, approximately, 40, 000, years, old, found, in, both, the, franco, cantabrian, region, in, western, europe, and, in, the, caves, in, the, district, of, maros, sulawesi, indonesia, in, november, 2018, however, scientists, reported, the, discovery, of, the, then, oldest, known, figurative, art, painting, over, 40, 000, perhaps, as, old, as, 52, 000, years, old, of, an, unknown, animal, in, the, cave, of, lubang, jeriji, sal, h, on, the, indonesian, island, of, borneo, kalimantan, in, december, 2019, figurative, cave, paintings, depicting, pig, hunting, in, the, maros, pangkep, karst, in, sulawesi, were, estimated, to, be, even, older, at, at, least, 43, 900, years, old, the, finding, was, noted, to, be, the, oldest, pictorial, record, of, storytelling, and, the, earliest, figurative, artwork, in, the, world, more, recently, in, 2021, cave, art, of, a, pig, found, in, an, indonesian, island, and, dated, to, over, 45, 500, years, has, been, reported, however, the, earliest, evidence, of, the, act, of, painting, has, been, discovered, in, two, rock, shelters, in, arnhem, land, in, northern, australia, in, the, lowest, layer, of, material, at, these, sites, there, are, used, pieces, of, ochre, estimated, to, be, 60, 000, years, old, archaeologists, have, also, found, a, fragment, of, rock, painting, preserved, in, a, limestone, rock, shelter, in, the, kimberley, region, of, north, western, australia, that, is, dated, to, 40, 000, years, old, there, are, examples, of, cave, paintings, all, over, the, world, in, indonesia, france, spain, portugal, italy, china, india, australia, mexico, etc, in, western, cultures, oil, painting, and, watercolor, painting, have, rich, and, complex, traditions, in, style, and, subject, matter, in, the, east, ink, and, color, ink, historically, predominated, the, choice, of, media, with, equally, rich, and, complex, traditions, the, invention, of, photography, had, a, major, impact, on, painting, in, the, decades, after, the, first, photograph, was, produced, in, 1829, photographic, processes, improved, and, became, more, widely, practiced, depriving, painting, of, much, of, its, historic, purpose, to, provide, an, accurate, record, of, the, observable, world, a, series, of, art, movements, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, notably, impressionism, post, impressionism, fauvism, expressionism, cubism, and, dadaism, challenged, the, renaissance, view, of, the, world, eastern, and, african, painting, however, continued, a, long, history, of, stylization, and, did, not, undergo, an, equivalent, transformation, at, the, same, time, modern, and, contemporary, art, has, moved, away, from, the, historic, value, of, craft, and, documentation, in, favour, of, concept, this, has, not, deterred, the, majority, of, living, painters, from, continuing, to, practice, painting, either, as, a, whole, or, part, of, their, work, the, vitality, and, versatility, of, painting, in, the, 21st, century, defy, the, previous, declarations, of, its, demise, in, an, epoch, characterized, by, the, idea, of, pluralism, there, is, no, consensus, as, to, a, representative, style, of, the, age, artists, continue, to, make, important, works, of, art, in, a, wide, variety, of, styles, and, aesthetic, temperaments, their, merits, are, left, to, the, public, and, the, marketplace, to, judge, the, feminist, art, movement, began, in, the, 1960s, during, the, second, wave, of, feminism, the, movement, sought, to, gain, equal, rights, and, equal, opportunities, for, female, artists, internationally, color, made, up, of, hue, saturation, and, value, dispersed, over, a, surface, is, the, essence, of, painting, just, as, pitch, and, rhythm, are, the, essence, of, music, color, is, highly, subjective, but, has, observable, psychological, effects, although, these, can, differ, from, one, culture, to, the, next, black, is, associated, with, mourning, in, the, west, but, in, the, east, white, is, some, painters, theoreticians, writers, and, scientists, including, goethe, kandinsky, and, newton, have, written, their, own, color, theory, moreover, the, use, of, language, is, only, an, abstraction, for, a, color, equivalent, the, word, red, for, example, can, cover, a, wide, range, of, variations, from, the, pure, red, of, the, visible, spectrum, of, light, there, is, not, a, formalized, register, of, different, colors, in, the, way, that, there, is, agreement, on, different, notes, in, music, such, as, f, or, c, for, a, painter, color, is, not, simply, divided, into, basic, primary, and, derived, complementary, or, mixed, colors, like, red, blue, green, brown, etc, painters, deal, practically, with, pigments, so, blue, for, a, painter, can, be, any, of, the, blues, phthalocyanine, blue, prussian, blue, indigo, cobalt, blue, ultramarine, and, so, on, psychological, and, symbolical, meanings, of, color, are, not, strictly, speaking, means, of, painting, colors, only, add, to, the, potential, derived, context, of, meanings, and, because, of, this, the, perception, of, a, painting, is, highly, subjective, the, analogy, with, music, is, quite, clear, sound, in, music, like, a, c, note, is, analogous, to, light, in, painting, shades, to, dynamics, and, coloration, is, to, painting, as, the, specific, timbre, of, musical, instruments, is, to, music, these, elements, do, not, necessarily, form, a, melody, in, music, of, themselves, rather, they, can, add, different, contexts, to, it, modern, artists, have, extended, the, practice, of, painting, considerably, to, include, as, one, example, collage, which, began, with, cubism, and, is, not, painting, in, the, strict, sense, some, modern, painters, incorporate, different, materials, such, as, metal, plastic, sand, cement, straw, leaves, or, wood, for, their, texture, examples, of, this, are, the, works, of, jean, dubuffet, and, anselm, kiefer, there, is, a, growing, community, of, artists, who, use, computers, to, paint, color, onto, a, digital, canvas, using, programs, such, as, adobe, photoshop, corel, painter, and, many, others, these, images, can, be, printed, onto, traditional, canvas, if, required, jean, metzinger, s, mosaic, like, divisionist, technique, had, its, parallel, in, literature, a, characteristic, of, the, alliance, between, symbolist, writers, and, neo, impressionist, artists, i, ask, of, divided, brushwork, not, the, objective, rendering, of, light, but, iridescences, and, certain, aspects, of, color, still, foreign, to, painting, i, make, a, kind, of, chromatic, versification, and, for, syllables, i, use, strokes, which, variable, in, quantity, cannot, differ, in, dimension, without, modifying, the, rhythm, of, a, pictorial, phraseology, destined, to, translate, the, diverse, emotions, aroused, by, nature, jean, metzinger, c, 1907, rhythm, for, artists, such, as, piet, mondrian, is, important, in, painting, as, it, is, in, music, if, one, defines, rhythm, as, a, pause, incorporated, into, a, sequence, then, there, can, be, rhythm, in, paintings, these, pauses, allow, creative, force, to, intervene, and, add, new, creations, form, melody, coloration, the, distribution, of, form, or, any, kind, of, information, is, of, crucial, importance, in, the, given, work, of, art, and, it, directly, affects, the, aesthetic, value, of, that, work, this, is, because, the, aesthetic, value, is, functionality, dependent, i, e, the, freedom, of, movement, of, perception, is, perceived, as, beauty, free, flow, of, energy, in, art, as, well, as, in, other, forms, of, techne, directly, contributes, to, the, aesthetic, value, music, was, important, to, the, birth, of, abstract, art, since, music, is, abstract, by, nature, it, does, not, try, to, represent, the, exterior, world, but, expresses, in, an, immediate, way, the, inner, feelings, of, the, soul, wassily, kandinsky, often, used, musical, terms, to, identify, his, works, he, called, his, most, spontaneous, paintings, improvisations, and, described, more, elaborate, works, as, compositions, kandinsky, theorized, that, music, is, the, ultimate, teacher, and, subsequently, embarked, upon, the, first, seven, of, his, ten, compositions, hearing, tones, and, chords, as, he, painted, kandinsky, theorized, that, for, example, yellow, is, the, color, of, middle, c, on, a, brassy, trumpet, black, is, the, color, of, closure, and, the, end, of, things, and, that, combinations, of, colors, produce, vibrational, frequencies, akin, to, chords, played, on, a, piano, in, 1871, the, young, kandinsky, learned, to, play, the, piano, and, cello, kandinsky, s, stage, design, for, a, performance, of, mussorgsky, s, pictures, at, an, exhibition, illustrates, his, synaesthetic, concept, of, a, universal, correspondence, of, forms, colors, and, musical, sounds, music, defines, much, of, modernist, abstract, painting, jackson, pollock, underscores, that, interest, with, his, 1950, painting, autumn, rhythm, number, 30, aesthetics, is, the, study, of, art, and, beauty, it, was, an, important, issue, for, 18th, and, 19th, century, philosophers, such, as, kant, and, hegel, classical, philosophers, like, plato, and, aristotle, also, theorized, about, art, and, painting, in, particular, plato, disregarded, painters, as, well, as, sculptors, in, his, philosophical, system, he, maintained, that, painting, cannot, depict, the, truth, it, is, a, copy, of, reality, a, shadow, of, the, world, of, ideas, and, is, nothing, but, a, craft, similar, to, shoemaking, or, iron, casting, by, the, time, of, leonardo, painting, had, become, a, closer, representation, of, the, truth, than, painting, was, in, ancient, greece, leonardo, da, vinci, on, the, contrary, said, that, italian, la, pittura, cosa, mentale, english, painting, is, a, thing, of, the, mind, kant, distinguished, between, beauty, and, the, sublime, in, terms, that, clearly, gave, priority, to, the, former, although, he, did, not, refer, to, painting, in, particular, this, concept, was, taken, up, by, painters, such, as, j, m, w, turner, and, caspar, david, friedrich, hegel, recognized, the, failure, of, attaining, a, universal, concept, of, beauty, and, in, his, aesthetic, essay, wrote, that, painting, is, one, of, the, three, romantic, arts, along, with, poetry, and, music, for, its, symbolic, highly, intellectual, purpose, painters, who, have, written, theoretical, works, on, painting, include, kandinsky, and, paul, klee, in, his, essay, kandinsky, maintains, that, painting, has, a, spiritual, value, and, he, attaches, primary, colors, to, essential, feelings, or, concepts, something, that, goethe, and, other, writers, had, already, tried, to, do, iconography, is, the, study, of, the, content, of, paintings, rather, than, their, style, erwin, panofsky, and, other, art, historians, first, seek, to, understand, the, things, depicted, before, looking, at, their, meaning, for, the, viewer, at, the, time, and, finally, analyzing, their, wider, cultural, religious, and, social, meaning, in, 1890, the, parisian, painter, maurice, denis, famously, asserted, remember, that, a, painting, before, being, a, warhorse, a, naked, woman, or, some, story, or, other, is, essentially, a, flat, surface, covered, with, colors, assembled, in, a, certain, order, thus, many, 20th, century, developments, in, painting, such, as, cubism, were, reflections, on, the, means, of, painting, rather, than, on, the, external, world, nature, which, had, previously, been, its, core, subject, recent, contributions, to, thinking, about, painting, have, been, offered, by, the, painter, and, writer, julian, bell, in, his, book, what, is, painting, bell, discusses, the, development, through, history, of, the, notion, that, paintings, can, express, feelings, and, ideas, in, mirror, of, the, world, bell, writes, a, work, of, art, seeks, to, hold, your, attention, and, keep, it, fixed, a, history, of, art, urges, it, onwards, bulldozing, a, highway, through, the, homes, of, the, imagination, different, types, of, paint, are, usually, identified, by, the, medium, that, the, pigment, is, suspended, or, embedded, in, which, determines, the, general, working, characteristics, of, the, paint, such, as, viscosity, miscibility, solubility, drying, time, etc, encaustic, painting, also, known, as, hot, wax, painting, involves, using, heated, beeswax, to, which, colored, pigments, are, added, the, liquid, paste, is, then, applied, to, a, surface, usually, prepared, wood, though, canvas, and, other, materials, are, often, used, the, simplest, encaustic, mixture, can, be, made, from, adding, pigments, to, beeswax, but, there, are, several, other, recipes, that, can, be, used, some, containing, other, types, of, waxes, damar, resin, linseed, oil, or, other, ingredients, pure, powdered, pigments, can, be, purchased, and, used, though, some, mixtures, use, oil, paints, or, other, forms, of, pigment, metal, tools, and, special, brushes, can, be, used, to, shape, the, paint, before, it, cools, or, heated, metal, tools, can, be, used, to, manipulate, the, wax, once, it, has, cooled, onto, the, surface, other, materials, can, be, encased, or, collaged, into, the, surface, or, layered, using, the, encaustic, medium, to, adhere, it, to, the, surface, the, technique, was, the, normal, one, for, ancient, greek, and, roman, panel, paintings, and, remained, in, use, in, the, eastern, orthodox, icon, tradition, watercolor, is, a, painting, method, in, which, the, paints, are, made, of, pigments, suspended, in, a, water, soluble, vehicle, the, traditional, and, most, common, support, for, watercolor, paintings, is, paper, other, supports, include, papyrus, bark, papers, plastics, vellum, or, leather, fabric, wood, and, canvas, in, east, asia, watercolor, painting, with, inks, is, referred, to, as, brush, painting, or, scroll, painting, in, chinese, korean, and, japanese, painting, it, has, been, the, dominant, medium, often, in, monochrome, black, or, browns, india, ethiopia, and, other, countries, also, have, long, traditions, finger, painting, with, watercolor, paints, originated, in, china, there, are, various, types, of, watercolors, used, by, artists, some, examples, are, pan, watercolors, liquid, watercolors, watercolor, brush, pens, and, watercolor, pencils, watercolor, pencils, water, soluble, color, pencils, may, be, used, either, wet, or, dry, gouache, is, a, water, based, paint, consisting, of, pigment, and, other, materials, designed, to, be, used, in, an, opaque, painting, method, gouache, differs, from, watercolor, in, that, the, particles, are, larger, the, ratio, of, pigment, to, water, is, much, higher, and, an, additional, inert, white, pigment, such, as, chalk, is, also, present, this, makes, gouache, heavier, and, more, opaque, with, greater, reflective, qualities, like, all, water, media, it, is, diluted, with, water, gouache, was, a, popular, paint, utilized, by, egyptians, painters, such, as, francois, boucher, used, this, medium, this, paint, is, best, applied, with, sable, brushes, ceramic, glaze, glazing, is, commonly, known, as, a, premelted, liquid, glass, this, glaze, can, be, dipped, or, brushed, on, this, glaze, appears, chalky, and, there, is, a, vast, difference, between, the, beginning, and, finished, result, to, be, activated, glazed, pottery, must, be, placed, in, a, kiln, to, be, fired, this, melts, the, silica, glass, in, the, glaze, and, transforms, it, into, a, vibrant, glossy, version, of, itself, ink, paintings, are, done, with, a, liquid, that, contains, pigments, or, dyes, and, is, used, to, color, a, surface, to, produce, an, image, text, or, design, ink, is, used, for, drawing, with, a, pen, brush, or, quill, ink, can, be, a, complex, medium, composed, of, solvents, pigments, dyes, resins, lubricants, solubilizers, surfactants, particulate, matter, fluorescers, and, other, materials, the, components, of, inks, serve, many, purposes, the, ink, s, carrier, colorants, and, other, additives, control, flow, and, thickness, of, the, ink, and, its, appearance, when, dry, enamels, are, made, by, painting, a, substrate, typically, metal, with, powdered, glass, minerals, called, color, oxides, provide, coloration, after, firing, at, a, temperature, of, 750, 850, degrees, celsius, 1380, 1560, degrees, fahrenheit, the, result, is, a, fused, lamination, of, glass, and, metal, unlike, most, painted, techniques, the, surface, can, be, handled, and, wetted, enamels, have, traditionally, been, used, for, decoration, of, precious, objects, but, have, also, been, used, for, other, purposes, limoges, enamel, was, the, leading, centre, of, renaissance, enamel, painting, with, small, religious, and, mythological, scenes, in, decorated, surrounds, on, plaques, or, objects, such, as, salts, or, caskets, in, the, 18th, century, enamel, painting, enjoyed, a, vogue, in, europe, especially, as, a, medium, for, portrait, miniatures, in, the, late, 20th, century, the, technique, of, porcelain, enamel, on, metal, has, been, used, as, a, durable, medium, for, outdoor, murals, tempera, also, known, as, egg, tempera, is, a, permanent, fast, drying, painting, medium, consisting, of, colored, pigment, mixed, with, a, water, soluble, binder, medium, usually, a, glutinous, material, such, as, egg, yolk, or, some, other, size, tempera, also, refers, to, the, paintings, done, in, this, medium, tempera, paintings, are, very, long, lasting, and, examples, from, the, first, centuries, ce, still, exist, egg, tempera, was, a, primary, method, of, painting, until, after, 1500, when, it, was, superseded, by, the, invention, of, oil, painting, a, paint, commonly, called, tempera, though, it, is, not, consisting, of, pigment, and, glue, size, is, commonly, used, and, referred, to, by, some, manufacturers, in, america, as, poster, paint, fresco, is, any, of, several, related, mural, painting, types, done, on, plaster, on, walls, or, ceilings, the, word, fresco, comes, from, the, italian, word, affresco, which, derives, from, the, latin, word, for, fresh, frescoes, were, often, made, during, the, renaissance, and, other, early, time, periods, buon, fresco, technique, consists, of, painting, in, pigment, mixed, with, water, on, a, thin, layer, of, wet, fresh, lime, mortar, or, plaster, for, which, the, italian, word, for, plaster, intonaco, is, used, a, secco, painting, in, contrast, is, done, on, dry, plaster, secco, is, dry, in, italian, the, pigments, require, a, binding, medium, such, as, egg, tempera, glue, or, oil, to, attach, the, pigment, to, the, wall, oil, painting, is, the, process, of, painting, with, pigments, that, are, bound, with, a, medium, of, drying, oil, such, as, linseed, oil, poppyseed, oil, which, was, widely, used, in, early, modern, europe, often, the, oil, was, boiled, with, a, resin, such, as, pine, resin, or, even, frankincense, these, were, called, varnishes, and, were, prized, for, their, body, and, gloss, oil, paint, eventually, became, the, principal, medium, used, for, creating, artworks, as, its, advantages, became, widely, known, the, transition, began, with, early, netherlandish, painting, in, northern, europe, and, by, the, height, of, the, renaissance, oil, painting, techniques, had, almost, completely, replaced, tempera, paints, in, the, majority, of, europe, pastel, is, a, painting, medium, in, the, form, of, a, stick, consisting, of, pure, powdered, pigment, and, a, binder, the, pigments, used, in, pastels, are, the, same, as, those, used, to, produce, all, colored, art, media, including, oil, paints, the, binder, is, of, a, neutral, hue, and, low, saturation, the, color, effect, of, pastels, is, closer, to, the, natural, dry, pigments, than, that, of, any, other, process, because, the, surface, of, a, pastel, painting, is, fragile, and, easily, smudged, its, preservation, requires, protective, measures, such, as, framing, under, glass, it, may, also, be, sprayed, with, a, fixative, nonetheless, when, made, with, permanent, pigments, and, properly, cared, for, a, pastel, painting, may, endure, unchanged, for, centuries, pastels, are, not, susceptible, as, are, paintings, made, with, a, fluid, medium, to, the, cracking, and, discoloration, that, result, from, changes, in, the, color, opacity, or, dimensions, of, the, medium, as, it, dries, acrylic, paint, is, fast, drying, paint, containing, pigment, suspension, in, acrylic, polymer, emulsion, acrylic, paints, can, be, diluted, with, water, but, become, water, resistant, when, dry, depending, on, how, much, the, paint, is, diluted, with, water, or, modified, with, acrylic, gels, media, or, pastes, the, finished, acrylic, painting, can, resemble, a, watercolor, or, an, oil, painting, or, have, its, own, unique, characteristics, not, attainable, with, other, media, the, main, practical, difference, between, most, acrylics, and, oil, paints, is, the, inherent, drying, time, oils, allow, for, more, time, to, blend, colors, and, apply, even, glazes, over, under, paintings, this, slow, drying, aspect, of, oil, can, be, seen, as, an, advantage, for, certain, techniques, but, may, also, impede, the, artist, s, ability, to, work, quickly, another, difference, is, that, watercolors, must, be, painted, onto, a, porous, surface, primarily, watercolor, paper, acrylic, paints, can, be, used, on, many, different, surfaces, both, acrylic, and, watercolor, are, easy, to, clean, up, with, water, acrylic, paint, should, be, cleaned, with, soap, and, water, immediately, following, use, watercolor, paint, can, be, cleaned, with, just, water, between, 1946, and, 1949, leonard, bocour, and, sam, golden, invented, a, solution, acrylic, paint, under, the, brand, magna, paint, these, were, mineral, spirit, based, paints, water, based, acrylic, paints, were, subsequently, sold, as, latex, house, paints, in, 1963, george, rowney, part, of, daler, rowney, since, 1983, was, the, first, manufacturer, to, introduce, artists, acrylic, paints, in, europe, under, the, brand, name, cryla, acrylics, are, the, most, common, paints, used, in, grattage, a, surrealist, technique, that, began, to, be, used, with, the, advent, of, this, type, of, paint, acrylics, are, used, for, this, purpose, because, they, easily, scrape, or, peel, from, a, surface, aerosol, paint, also, called, spray, paint, is, a, type, of, paint, that, comes, in, a, sealed, pressurized, container, and, is, released, in, a, fine, spray, mist, when, depressing, a, valve, button, a, form, of, spray, painting, aerosol, paint, leaves, a, smooth, evenly, coated, surface, standard, sized, cans, are, portable, inexpensive, and, easy, to, store, aerosol, primer, can, be, applied, directly, to, bare, metal, and, many, plastics, speed, portability, and, permanence, also, make, aerosol, paint, a, common, graffiti, medium, in, the, late, 1970s, street, graffiti, writers, signatures, and, murals, became, more, elaborate, and, a, unique, style, developed, as, a, factor, of, the, aerosol, medium, and, the, speed, required, for, illicit, work, many, now, recognize, graffiti, and, street, art, as, a, unique, art, form, and, specifically, manufactured, aerosol, paints, are, made, for, the, graffiti, artist, a, stencil, protects, a, surface, except, the, specific, shape, to, be, painted, stencils, can, be, purchased, as, movable, letters, ordered, as, professionally, cut, logos, or, hand, cut, by, artists, water, miscible, oil, paints, also, called, water, soluble, or, water, mixable, is, a, modern, variety, of, oil, paint, engineered, to, be, thinned, and, cleaned, up, with, water, rather, than, having, to, use, chemicals, such, as, turpentine, it, can, be, mixed, and, applied, using, the, same, techniques, as, traditional, oil, based, paint, but, while, still, wet, it, can, be, effectively, removed, from, brushes, palettes, and, rags, with, ordinary, soap, and, water, its, water, solubility, comes, from, the, use, of, an, oil, medium, in, which, one, end, of, the, molecule, has, been, altered, to, bind, loosely, to, water, molecules, as, in, a, solution, sandpainting, is, the, art, of, pouring, coloured, sands, and, powdered, pigments, from, minerals, or, crystals, or, pigments, from, other, natural, or, synthetic, sources, onto, a, surface, to, make, a, fixed, or, unfixed, sand, painting, digital, painting, is, a, method, of, creating, an, art, object, painting, digitally, or, a, technique, for, making, digital, art, on, the,
