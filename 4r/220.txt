to, find, that, there, were, few, written, records, of, russian, domestic, life, from, that, time, and, tried, to, rectify, these, omissions, in, early, drafts, of, the, novel, the, first, half, of, the, book, was, named, 1805, during, the, writing, of, the, second, half, he, read, widely, and, acknowledged, schopenhauer, as, one, of, his, main, inspirations, tolstoy, wrote, in, a, letter, to, afanasy, fet, that, what, he, had, written, in, war, and, peace, is, also, said, by, schopenhauer, in, the, world, as, will, and, representation, however, tolstoy, approaches, it, from, the, other, side, the, first, draft, of, the, novel, was, completed, in, 1863, in, 1865, the, periodical, russkiy, vestnik, the, russian, messenger, published, the, first, part, of, this, draft, under, the, title, 1805, and, published, more, the, following, year, tolstoy, was, dissatisfied, with, this, version, although, he, allowed, several, parts, of, it, to, be, published, with, a, different, ending, in, 1867, he, heavily, rewrote, the, entire, novel, between, 1866, and, 1869, tolstoy, s, wife, sophia, tolstaya, copied, as, many, as, seven, separate, complete, manuscripts, before, tolstoy,

and, peace, in, 1869, russians, who, had, read, the, serialized, version, were, eager, to, buy, the, complete, novel, and, it, sold, out, almost, immediately, the, novel, was, quickly, translated, after, publication, into, many, other, languages, it, is, unknown, why, tolstoy, changed, the, name, of, the, work, to, war, and, peace, in, reformed, orthography, and, in, pre, reform, orthography, pronounced, voyna, i, mir, he, may, have, borrowed, the, title, from, the, 1861, work, of, pierre, joseph, proudhon, la, guerre, et, la, paix, war, and, peace, in, french, the, title, may, also, be, a, reference, to, the, roman, emperor, titus, who, reigned, from, 79, to, 81, ad, and, was, described, as, being, a, master, of, war, and, peace, in, the, twelve, caesars, written, by, suetonius, in, 119, the, 1805, manuscript, was, re, edited, and, annotated, in, russia, in, 1893, and, has, been, since, translated, into, english, german, french, spanish, dutch, swedish, finnish, albanian, korean, and, czech, tolstoy, was, instrumental, in, bringing, a, new, kind, of, consciousness, to, the, novel, his, narrative, structure, is, noted, not, only, for, its, god, s, eye, point, of, view, over, and, within, events, but, also, in, the, way, it, swiftly, and, seamlessly, portrayed, an, individual, character, s, viewpoint, his, use, of, visual, detail, is, often, comparable, to, cinema, using, literary, techniques, that, resemble, panning, wide, shots, and, close, ups, these, devices, while, not, exclusive, to, tolstoy, are, part, of, the, new, style, of, the, novel, that, arose, in, the, mid, 19th, century, and, of, which, tolstoy, proved, himself, a, master, the, standard, russian, text, of, war, and, peace, is, divided, into, four, volumes, comprising, fifteen, books, and, an, epilogue, split, into, two, parts, roughly, the, first, half, is, concerned, strictly, with, the, fictional, characters, whereas, the, latter, parts, as, well, as, the, second, part, of, the, epilogue, increasingly, consist, of, essays, about, the, nature, of, war, power, history, and, historiography, tolstoy, interspersed, these, essays, into, the, story, in, a, way, that, defies, previous, fictional, convention, certain, abridged, versions, remove, these, essays, entirely, while, others, published, even, during, tolstoy, s, life, simply, moved, these, essays, into, an, appendix, the, plot, novel, is, set, 60, years, before, tolstoy, wrote, it, but, he, had, spoken, with, people, who, lived, through, the, 1812, french, invasion, of, russia, he, read, all, the, standard, histories, available, in, russian, and, french, about, the, napoleonic, wars, as, well, as, letters, journals, autobiographies, and, biographies, of, napoleon, and, other, key, players, of, that, era, there, are, approximately, 160, real, persons, named, or, referred, to, in, war, and, peace, he, worked, from, primary, source, materials, such, as, interviews, and, other, documents, as, well, as, from, history, books, philosophy, texts, and, other, historical, novels, tolstoy, used, a, great, deal, of, his, own, experience, in, the, crimean, war, to, bring, vivid, detail, and, first, hand, accounts, of, how, the, imperial, russian, army, was, structured, tolstoy, was, critical, of, standard, history, especially, military, history, in, war, and, peace, he, explains, at, the, start, of, the, novel, s, third, volume, his, own, views, on, how, history, ought, to, be, written, although, the, book, is, mainly, in, russian, significant, portions, of, dialogue, are, in, french, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, use, of, french, is, a, deliberate, literary, device, to, portray, artifice, while, russian, emerges, as, a, language, of, sincerity, honesty, and, seriousness, it, could, however, also, simply, represent, another, element, of, the, realistic, style, in, which, the, book, is, written, since, french, was, the, common, language, of, the, russian, aristocracy, and, more, generally, the, aristocracies, of, continental, europe, at, the, time, in, fact, the, russian, nobility, often, knew, only, enough, russian, to, command, their, servants, julie, karagina, a,

suggested, that, this, is, to, demonstrate, russia, freeing, itself, from, foreign, cultural, domination, and, to, show, that, a, once, friendly, nation, has, turned, into, an, enemy, by, midway,

the, closing, chapters, that, the, idealistic, boyish, nikolenka, and, pierre, would, both, become, part, of, the, decembrist, uprising, the, first, epilogue, concludes, with, nikolenka, promising, he, would, do, something, with, which, even, his, late, father, would, be, satisfied, presumably, as, a, revolutionary, in, the, decembrist, revolt, the, second, part, of, the, epilogue, contains, tolstoy, s, critique, of, all, existing, forms, of, mainstream, history, the, 19th, century, great, man, theory, claims, that, historical, events, are, the, result, of, the, actions, of, heroes, and, other, great, individuals, tolstoy, argues, that, this, is, impossible, because, of, how, rarely, these, actions, result, in, great, historical, events, rather, he, argues, great, historical, events, are, the, result, of, many, smaller, events, driven, by, the, thousands, of, individuals, involved, a, summation, which, he, earlier, in, part, iii, chapter, 1, compared, to, calculus, and, the, sum, of, infinitesimals, he, then, goes, on, to, argue, that, these, smaller, events, are, the, result, of, an, inverse, relationship, between, necessity, and, free, will, necessity, being, based, on, reason, and, therefore, explicable, through, historical, analysis, and, free, will, being, based, on, consciousness, and, therefore, inherently, unpredictable, tolstoy, also, ridicules, newly, emerging, darwinism, as, overly, simplistic, comparing, it, to, plasterers, covering, over, the, windows, icons, and, scaffolding, with, plaster, impressed, with, the, smooth, result, he, wrestles, with, the, tension, between, our, consciousness, of, freedom, and, the, apparent, need, for, necessity, to, develop, laws, of, science, and, history, saying, at, times, that, the, first, is, as, real, as, the, second, and, yet, that, its, reality, would, destroy, the, second, he, concludes, that, just, as, astronomy, had, to, adopt, the, copernican, hypothesis, of, the, earth, s, movement, not, because, it, fits, our, immediate, perceptions, but, to, avoid, absurdities, so, too, must, historical, science, accept, some, conception, of, necessary, laws, of, human, action, even, though, we, feel, free, in, our, ordinary, lives, in, an, appendix, he, tries, to, further, resolve, the, tension, with, the, suggestion, that, we, are, most, free, or, feel, most, free, in, arbitrary, acts, affecting, us, alone, but, less, free, in, acts, affecting, other, people, where, moral, or, other, principles, force, or, forbid, certain, responses, war, and, peace, is, tolstoy, s, longest, work, consisting, of, 361, chapters, of, those, 24, are, philosophical, chapters, with, the, author, s, comments, and, views, rather, than, narrative, these, chapters, discuss, historical, events, but, do, not, touch, on, the, fictional, plot, of, the, novel, the, novel, that, made, its, author, the, true, lion, of, the, russian, literature, according, to, ivan, goncharov, enjoyed, great, success, with, the, reading, public, upon, its, publication, and, spawned, dozens, of, reviews, and, analytical, essays, some, of, which, by, dmitry, pisarev, pavel, annenkov, dragomirov, and, strakhov, formed, the, basis, for, the, research, of, later, tolstoy, scholars, yet, the, russian, press, s, initial, response, to, the, novel, was, muted, with, most, critics, unable, to, decide, how, to, classify, it, the, liberal, newspaper, golos, the, voice, april, 3, 93, 1865, was, one, of, the, first, to, react, its, anonymous, reviewer, posed, a, question, later, repeated, by, many, others, what, could, this, possibly, be, what, kind, of, genre, are, we, supposed, to, file, it, to, where, is, fiction, in, it, and, where, is, real, history, writer, and, critic, nikolai, akhsharumov, writing, in, vsemirny, trud, 6, 1867, suggested, that, war, and, peace, was, neither, a, chronicle, nor, a, historical, novel, but, a, genre, merger, this, ambiguity, never, undermining, its, immense, value, annenkov, who, praised, the, novel, too, was, equally, vague, when, trying, to, classify, it, the, cultural, history, of, one, large, section, of, our, society, the, political, and, social, panorama, of, it, in, the, beginning, of, the, current, century, was, his, suggestion, it, is, the, epic, the, history, novel, and, the, vast, picture, of, the, whole, nation, s, life, wrote, ivan, turgenev, in, his, bid, to, define, war, and, peace, in, the, foreword, for, his, french, translation, of, the, two, hussars, published, in, paris, by, le, temps, in, 1875, in, general, the, literary, left, received, the, novel, coldly, they, saw, it, as, devoid, of, social, critique, and, keen, on, the, idea, of, national, unity, they, saw, its, major, fault, as, the, author, s, inability, to, portray, a, new, kind, of, revolutionary, intelligentsia, in, his, novel, as, critic, varfolomey, zaytsev, put, it, articles, by, d, minayev, vasily, bervi, flerovsky, and, n, shelgunov, in, delo, magazine, characterized, the, novel, as, lacking, realism, showing, its, characters, as, cruel, and, rough, mentally, stoned, morally, depraved, and, promoting, the, philosophy, of, stagnation, still, mikhail, saltykov, schedrin, who, never, expressed, his, opinion, of, the, novel, publicly, in, private, conversation, was, reported, to, have, expressed, delight, with, how, strongly, this, count, has, stung, our, higher, society, dmitry, pisarev, in, his, unfinished, article, russian, gentry, of, old, staroye, barstvo, otechestvennye, zapiski, 2, 1868, while, praising, tolstoy, s, realism, in, portraying, members, of, high, society, was, still, unhappy, with, the, way, the, author, as, he, saw, it, idealized, the, old, nobility, expressing, unconscious, and, quite, natural, tenderness, towards, the, russian, dvoryanstvo, on, the, opposite, front, the, conservative, press, and, patriotic, authors, a, s, norov, and, p, a, vyazemsky, among, them, were, accusing, tolstoy, of, consciously, distorting, 1812, history, desecrating, the, patriotic, feelings, of, our, fathers, and, ridiculing, dvoryanstvo, one, of, the, first, comprehensive, articles, on, the, novel, was, that, of, pavel, annenkov, published, in, 2, 1868, issue, of, vestnik, evropy, the, critic, praised, tolstoy, s, masterful, portrayal, of, man, at, war, marveled, at, the, complexity, of, the, whole, composition, organically, merging, historical, facts, and, fiction, the, dazzling, side, of, the, novel, according, to, annenkov, was, the, natural, simplicity, with, which, transports, the, worldly, affairs, and, big, social, events, down, to, the, level, of, a, character, who, witnesses, them, annekov, thought, the, historical, gallery, of, the, novel, was, incomplete, with, the, two, great, raznotchintsys, speransky, and, arakcheyev, and, deplored, the, fact, that, the, author, stopped, at, introducing, to, the, novel, this, relatively, rough, but, original, element, in, the, end, the, critic, called, the, novel, the, whole, epoch, in, the, russian, fiction, slavophiles, declared, tolstoy, their, bogatyr, and, pronounced, war, and, peace, the, bible, of, the, new, national, idea, several, articles, on, war, and, peace, were, published, in, 1869, 70, in, zarya, magazine, by, nikolay, strakhov, war, and, peace, is, the, work, of, genius, equal, to, everything, that, the, russian, literature, has, produced, before, he, pronounced, in, the, first, smaller, essay, it, is, now, quite, clear, that, from, 1868, when, the, war, and, peace, was, published, the, very, essence, of, what, we, call, russian, literature, has, become, quite, different, acquired, the, new, form, and, meaning, the, critic, continued, later, strakhov, was, the, first, critic, in, russia, who, declared, tolstoy, s, novel, to, be, a, masterpiece, of, a, level, previously, unknown, in, russian, literature, still, being, a, true, slavophile, he, could, not, fail, to, see, the, novel, as, promoting, the, major, slavophiliac, ideas, of, meek, russian, character, s, supremacy, over, the, rapacious, european, kind, using, apollon, grigoryev, s, formula, years, later, in, 1878, discussing, strakhov, s, own, book, the, world, as, a, whole, tolstoy, criticized, both, grigoriev, s, concept, of, russian, meekness, vs, western, bestiality, and, strakhov, s, interpretation, of, it, among, the, reviewers, were, military, men, and, authors, specializing, in, war, literature, most, assessed, highly, the, artfulness, and, realism, of, tolstoy, s, battle, scenes, n, lachinov, a, member, of, the, russky, invalid, newspaper, staff, 69, april, 10, 1868, called, the, battle, of, sch, ngrabern, scenes, bearing, the, highest, degree, of, historical, and, artistic, truthfulness, and, totally, agreed, with, the, author, s, view, on, the, battle, of, borodino, which, some, of, his, opponents, disputed, the, army, general, and, respected, military, writer, mikhail, dragomirov, in, an, article, published, in, oruzheiny, sbornik, the, military, almanac, 1868, 70, while, disputing, some, of, tolstoy, s, ideas, concerning, the, spontaneity, of, wars, and, the, role, of, commander, in, battles, advised, all, the, russian, army, officers, to, use, war, and, peace, as, their, desk, book, describing, its, battle, scenes, as, incomparable, and, serving, for, an, ideal, manual, to, every, textbook, on, theories, of, military, art, unlike, professional, literary, critics, most, prominent, russian, writers, of, the, time, supported, the, novel, wholeheartedly, goncharov, turgenev, leskov, dostoevsky, and, fet, have, all, gone, on, record, as, declaring, war, and, peace, the, masterpiece, of, russian, literature, ivan, goncharov, in, a, july, 17, 1878, letter, to, pyotr, ganzen, advised, him, to, choose, for, translating, into, danish, war, and, peace, adding, this, is, positively, what, might, be, called, a, russian, iliad, embracing, the, whole, epoch, it, is, the, grandiose, literary, event, showcasing, the, gallery, of, great, men, painted, by, a, lively, brush, of, the, great, master, this, is, one, of, the, most, if, not, the, most, profound, literary, work, ever, in, 1879, unhappy, with, ganzen, having, chosen, anna, karenina, to, start, with, goncharov, insisted, war, and, peace, is, the, extraordinary, poem, of, a, novel, both, in, content, and, execution, it, also, serves, as, a, monument, to, russian, history, s, glorious, epoch, when, whatever, figure, you, take, is, a, colossus, a, statue, in, bronze, even, minor, characters, carry, all, the, characteristic, features, of, the, russian, people, and, its, life, in, 1885, expressing, satisfaction, with, the, fact, that, tolstoy, s, works, had, by, then, been, translated, into, danish, goncharov, again, stressed, the, immense, importance, of, war, and, peace, count, tolstoy, really, mounts, over, everybody, else, here, he, remarked, fyodor, dostoevsky, in, a, may, 30, 1871, letter, to, strakhov, described, war, and, peace, as, the, last, word, of, the, landlord, s, literature, and, the, brilliant, one, at, that, in, a, draft, version, of, the, raw, youth, he, described, tolstoy, as, a, historiograph, of, the, dvoryanstvo, or, rather, its, cultural, elite, the, objectivity, and, realism, impart, wonderful, charm, to, all, scenes, and, alongside, people, of, talent, honour, and, duty, he, exposes, numerous, scoundrels, worthless, goons, and, fools, he, added, in, 1876, dostoevsky, wrote, my, strong, conviction, is, that, a, writer, of, fiction, has, to, have, most, profound, knowledge, not, only, of, the, poetic, side, of, his, art, but, also, the, reality, he, deals, with, in, its, historical, as, well, as, contemporary, context, here, as, far, as, i, see, it, only, one, writer, excels, in, this, count, lev, tolstoy, nikolai, leskov, then, an, anonymous, reviewer, in, birzhevy, vestnik, the, stock, exchange, herald, wrote, several, articles, praising, highly, war, and, peace, calling, it, the, best, ever, russian, historical, novel, and, the, pride, of, the, contemporary, literature, marveling, at, the, realism, and, factual, truthfulness, of, tolstoy, s, book, leskov, thought, the, author, deserved, the, special, credit, for, having, lifted, up, the, people, s, spirit, upon, the, high, pedestal, it, deserved, while, working, most, elaborately, upon, individual, characters, the, author, apparently, has, been, studying, most, diligently, the, character, of, the, nation, as, a, whole, the, life, of, people, whose, moral, strength, came, to, be, concentrated, in, the, army, that, came, up, to, fight, mighty, napoleon, in, this, respect, the, novel, of, count, tolstoy, could, be, seen, as, an, epic, of, the, great, national, war, which, up, until, now, has, had, its, historians, but, never, had, its, singers, leskov, wrote, afanasy, fet, in, a, january, 1, 1870, letter, to, tolstoy, expressed, his, great, delight, with, the, novel, you, ve, managed, to, show, us, in, great, detail, the, other, mundane, side, of, life, and, explain, how, organically, does, it, feed, the, outer, heroic, side, of, it, he, added, ivan, turgenev, gradually, re, considered, his, initial, skepticism, as, to, the, novel, s, historical, aspect, and, also, the, style, of, tolstoy, s, psychological, analysis, in, his, 1880, article, written, in, the, form, of, a, letter, addressed, to, edmond, abou, the, editor, of, the, french, newspaper, le, xix, e, si, cle, turgenev, described, tolstoy, as, the, most, popular, russian, writer, and, war, and, peace, as, one, of, the, most, remarkable, books, of, our, age, this, vast, work, has, the, spirit, of, an, epic, where, the, life, of, russia, of, the, beginning, of, our, century, in, general, and, in, details, has, been, recreated, by, the, hand, of, a, true, master, the, manner, in, which, count, tolstoy, conducts, his, treatise, is, innovative, and, original, this, is, the, great, work, of, a, great, writer, and, in, it, there, s, true, real, russia, turgenev, wrote, it, was, largely, due, to, turgenev, s, efforts, that, the, novel, started, to, gain, popularity, with, the, european, readership, the, first, french, edition, of, the, war, and, peace, 1879, paved, the, way, for, the, worldwide, success, of, leo, tolstoy, and, his, works, since, then, many, world, famous, authors, have, praised, war, and, peace, as, a, masterpiece, of, world, literature, gustave, flaubert, expressed, his, delight, in, a, january, 1880, letter, to, turgenev, writing, this, is, the, first, class, work, what, an, artist, and, what, a, psychologist, the, first, two, volumes, are, exquisite, i, used, to, utter, shrieks, of, delight, while, reading, this, is, powerful, very, powerful, indeed, later, john, galsworthy, called, war, and, peace, the, best, novel, that, had, ever, been, written, romain, rolland, remembering, his, reading, the, novel, as, a, student, wrote, this, work, like, life, itself, has, no, beginning, no, end, it, is, life, itself, in, its, eternal, movement, thomas, mann, thought, war, and, peace, to, be, the, greatest, ever, war, novel, in, the, history, of, literature, when, virginia, woolf, finished, the, book, she, declared, there, remains, the, greatest, of, all, novelists, for, what, else, can, we, call, the, author, of, war, and, peace, ernest, hemingway, confessed, that, it, was, from, tolstoy, that, he, had, been, taking, lessons, on, how, to, write, about, war, in, the, most, straightforward, honest, objective, and, stark, way, i, don, t, know, anybody, who, could, write, about, war, better, than, tolstoy, did, hemingway, asserted, in, his, 1955, men, at, war, the, best, war, stories, of, all, time, anthology, isaac, babel, said, after, reading, war, and, peace, if, the, world, could, write, by, itself, it, would, write, like, tolstoy, tolstoy, gives, us, a, unique, combination, of, the, naive, objectivity, of, the, oral, narrator, with, the, interest, in, detail, characteristic, of, realism, this, is, the, reason, for, our, trust, in, his, presentation, war, and, peace, has, been, translated, into, many, languages, it, has, been, translated, into, english, on, several, occasions, starting, with, clara, bell, working, from, a, french, translation, the, translators, constance, garnett, and, aylmer, and, louise, maude, knew, tolstoy, personally, translations, have, to, deal, with, tolstoy, s, often, peculiar, syntax, and, his, fondness, for, repetitions, only, about, two, percent, of, war, and, peace, is, in, french, tolstoy, removed, the, french, in, a, revised, 1873, edition, only, to, restore, it, later, most, translators, follow, garnett, retaining, some, french, briggs, and, shubin, use, no, french, while, pevear, volokhonsky, s, and, amy, mandelker, s, revisions, of, the, maude, translation, both, retain, the, french, fully, translators, listed, full, translations, abridged, translation, translation, of, draft, of, 1863, in, the, encyclopedia, of, literary, translation, into, english, academic, zoja, pavlovskis, petit, has, this, to, say, about, the, translations, of, war, and, peace, available, in, 2000, of, all, the, translations, of, war, and, peace, dunnigan, s, 1968, is, the, best, unlike, the, other, translators, dunnigan, even, succeeds, with, many, characteristically, russian, folk, expressions, and, proverbs, she, is, faithful, to, the, text, and, does, not, hesitate, to, render, conscientiously, those, details, that, the, uninitiated, may, find, bewildering, for, instance, the, statement, that, boris, s, mother, pronounced, his, name, with, a, stress, on, the, o, an, indication, to, the, russian, reader, of, the, old, lady, s, affectation, on, the, garnett, translation, pavlovskis, petit, writes, her, war, and, peace, is, frequently, inexact, and, contains, too, many, anglicisms, her, style, is, awkward, and, turgid, very, unsuitable, for, tolstoi, on, the, maudes, translation, she, comments, this, should, have, been, the, best, translation, but, the, maudes, lack, of, adroitness, in, dealing, with, russian, folk, idiom, and, their, style, in, general, place, this, version, below, dunnigan, s, she, further, comments, on, edmonds, s, revised, translation, formerly, on, penguin, is, the, work, of, a, sound, scholar, but, not, the, best, possible, translator, it, frequently, lacks, resourcefulness, and, imagination, in, its, use, of, english, a, respectable, translation, but, not, on, the, level, of, dunnigan, or, maude
