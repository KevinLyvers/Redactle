abstract, art, uses, visual, language, of, shape, form, color, and, line, to, create, a, composition, which, may, exist, with, a, degree, of, independence, from, visual, references, in, the, world, western, art, had, been, from, the, renaissance, up, to, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, underpinned, by, the, logic, of, perspective, and, an, attempt, to, reproduce, an, illusion, of, visible, reality, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, many, artists, felt, a, need, to, create, a, new, kind, of, art, which, would, encompass, the, fundamental, changes, taking, place, in, technology, science, and, philosophy, the, sources, from, which, individual, artists, drew, their, theoretical, arguments, were, diverse, and, reflected, the, social, and, intellectual, preoccupations, in, all, areas, of, western, culture, at, that, time, abstract, art, non, figurative, art, non, objective, art, and, non, representational, art, are, all, closely, related, terms, they, have, similar, but, perhaps, not, identical, meanings, abstraction, indicates, a, departure, from, reality, in, depiction, of, imagery, in, art, this, departure, from, accurate, representation, can, be, slight, partial, or, complete, abstraction, exists, along, a, continuum, even, art, that, aims, for, verisimilitude, of, the, highest, degree, can, be, said, to, be, abstract, at, least, theoretically, since, perfect, representation, is, impossible, artwork, which, takes, liberties, e, g, altering, color, or, form, in, ways, that, are, conspicuous, can, be, said, to, be, partially, abstract, total, abstraction, bears, no, trace, of, any, reference, to, anything, recognizable, in, geometric, abstraction, for, instance, one, is, unlikely, to, find, references, to, naturalistic, entities, figurative, art, and, total, abstraction, are, almost, mutually, exclusive, but, figurative, and, representational, or, realistic, art, often, contain, partial, abstraction, both, geometric, abstraction, and, lyrical, abstraction, are, often, totally, abstract, among, the, very, numerous, art, movements, that, embody, partial, abstraction, would, be, for, instance, fauvism, in, which, color, is, conspicuously, and, deliberately, altered, vis, a, vis, reality, and, cubism, which, alters, the, forms, of, the, real, life, entities, depicted, patronage, from, the, church, diminished, and, private, patronage, from, the, public, became, more, capable, of, providing, a, livelihood, for, artists, three, art, movements, which, contributed, to, the, development, of, abstract, art, were, romanticism, impressionism, and, expressionism, artistic, independence, for, artists, was, advanced, during, the, 19th, century, an, objective, interest, in, what, is, seen, can, be, discerned, from, the, paintings, of, john, constable, j, m, w, turner, camille, corot, and, from, them, to, the, impressionists, who, continued, the, plein, air, painting, of, the, barbizon, school, early, intimations, of, a, new, art, had, been, made, by, james, mcneill, whistler, who, in, his, painting, nocturne, in, black, and, gold, the, falling, rocket, 1872, placed, greater, emphasis, on, visual, sensation, than, the, depiction, of, objects, even, earlier, than, that, with, her, spirit, drawings, georgiana, houghton, s, choice, to, work, with, abstract, shapes, correlate, with, the, unnatural, nature, of, her, subject, in, a, time, when, abstraction, isn, t, yet, a, concept, she, organized, an, exhibit, in, 1871, expressionist, painters, explored, the, bold, use, of, paint, surface, drawing, distortions, and, exaggerations, and, intense, color, expressionists, produced, emotionally, charged, paintings, that, were, reactions, to, and, perceptions, of, contemporary, experience, and, reactions, to, impressionism, and, other, more, conservative, directions, of, late, 19th, century, painting, the, expressionists, drastically, changed, the, emphasis, on, subject, matter, in, favor, of, the, portrayal, of, psychological, states, of, being, although, artists, like, edvard, munch, and, james, ensor, drew, influences, principally, from, the, work, of, the, post, impressionists, they, were, instrumental, to, the, advent, of, abstraction, in, the, 20th, century, paul, c, zanne, had, begun, as, an, impressionist, but, his, aim, to, make, a, logical, construction, of, reality, based, on, a, view, from, a, single, point, with, modulated, color, in, flat, areas, became, the, basis, of, a, new, visual, art, later, to, be, developed, into, cubism, additionally, in, the, late, 19th, century, in, eastern, europe, mysticism, and, early, modernist, religious, philosophy, as, expressed, by, theosophist, mme, blavatsky, had, a, profound, impact, on, pioneer, geometric, artists, like, hilma, af, klint, and, wassily, kandinsky, the, mystical, teaching, of, georges, gurdjieff, and, p, d, ouspensky, also, had, an, important, influence, on, the, early, formations, of, the, geometric, abstract, styles, of, piet, mondrian, and, his, colleagues, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, spiritualism, also, inspired, the, abstract, art, of, kasimir, malevich, and, franti, ek, kupka, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, henri, matisse, and, several, other, young, artists, including, the, pre, cubist, georges, braque, andr, derain, raoul, dufy, and, jean, metzinger, revolutionized, the, paris, art, world, with, wild, multi, colored, expressive, landscapes, and, figure, paintings, that, the, critics, called, fauvism, the, raw, language, of, color, as, developed, by, the, fauves, directly, influenced, another, pioneer, of, abstraction, wassily, kandinsky, cubism, based, on, c, zanne, s, idea, that, all, depiction, of, nature, can, be, reduced, to, cube, sphere, and, cone, became, along, with, fauvism, the, art, movement, that, directly, opened, the, door, to, abstraction, in, the, early, 20th, century, during, the, 1912, salon, de, la, section, d, or, where, franti, ek, kupka, exhibited, his, abstract, painting, amorpha, fugue, en, deux, couleurs, fugue, in, two, colors, 1912, the, poet, guillaume, apollinaire, named, the, work, of, several, artists, including, robert, delaunay, orphism, he, defined, it, as, the, art, of, painting, new, structures, out, of, elements, that, have, not, been, borrowed, from, the, visual, sphere, but, had, been, created, entirely, by, the, artist, it, is, a, pure, art, since, the, turn, of, the, century, cultural, connections, between, artists, of, the, major, european, cities, had, become, extremely, active, as, they, strove, to, create, an, art, form, equal, to, the, high, aspirations, of, modernism, ideas, were, able, to, cross, fertilize, by, means, of, artist, s, books, exhibitions, and, manifestos, so, that, many, sources, were, open, to, experimentation, and, discussion, and, formed, a, basis, for, a, diversity, of, modes, of, abstraction, the, following, extract, from, the, world, backwards, gives, some, impression, of, the, inter, connectedness, of, culture, at, the, time, david, burliuk, s, knowledge, of, modern, art, movements, must, have, been, extremely, up, to, date, for,

from, the, printers, while, he, was, in, germany, from, 1909, to, 1913, many, experimental, works, in, the, search, for, this, pure, art, had, been, created, by, a, number, of, artists, francis,

plasticism, was, the, aesthetic, which, mondrian, theo, van, doesburg, and, other, in, the, group, de, stijl, intended, to, reshape, the, environment, of, the, future, many, of, the, abstract, artists, in, russia, became, constructivists, believing, that, art, was, no, longer, something, remote, but, life, itself, the, artist, must, become, a, technician, learning, to, use, the, tools, and, materials, of, modern, production, art, into, life, was, vladimir, tatlin, s, slogan, and, that, of, all, the, future, constructivists, varvara, stepanova, and, alexandre, exter, and, others, abandoned, easel, painting, and, diverted, their, energies, to, theatre, design, and, graphic, works, on, the, other, side, stood, kazimir, malevich, anton, pevsner, and, naum, gabo, they, argued, that, art, was, essentially, a, spiritual, activity, to, create, the, individual, s, place, in, the, world, not, to, organize, life, in, a, practical, materialistic, sense, during, that, time, representatives, of, the, russian, avant, garde, collaborated, with, other, eastern, european, constructivist, artists, including, w, adys, aw, strzemi, ski, katarzyna, kobro, and, henryk, sta, ewski, many, of, those, who, were, hostile, to, the, materialist, production, idea, of, art, left, russia, anton, pevsner, went, to, france, gabo, went, first, to, berlin, then, to, england, and, finally, to, america, kandinsky, studied, in, moscow, then, left, for, the, bauhaus, by, the, mid, 1920s, the, revolutionary, period, 1917, to, 1921, when, artists, had, been, free, to, experiment, was, over, and, by, the, 1930s, only, socialist, realism, was, allowed, as, visual, art, becomes, more, abstract, it, develops, some, characteristics, of, music, an, art, form, which, uses, the, abstract, elements, of, sound, and, divisions, of, time, wassily, kandinsky, himself, an, amateur, musician, was, inspired, by, the, possibility, of, marks, and, associative, color, resounding, in, the, soul, the, idea, had, been, put, forward, by, charles, baudelaire, that, all, our, senses, respond, to, various, stimuli, but, the, senses, are, connected, at, a, deeper, aesthetic, level, closely, related, to, this, is, the, idea, that, art, has, the, spiritual, dimension, and, can, transcend, every, day, experience, reaching, a, spiritual, plane, the, theosophical, society, popularized, the, ancient, wisdom, of, the, sacred, books, of, india, and, china, in, the, early, years, of, the, century, it, was, in, this, context, that, piet, mondrian, wassily, kandinsky, hilma, af, klint, and, other, artists, working, towards, an, objectless, state, became, interested, in, the, occult, as, a, way, of, creating, an, inner, object, the, universal, and, timeless, shapes, found, in, geometry, the, circle, square, and, triangle, become, the, spatial, elements, in, abstract, art, they, are, like, color, fundamental, systems, underlying, visible, reality, the, bauhaus, at, weimar, germany, was, founded, in, 1919, by, walter, gropius, the, philosophy, underlying, the, teaching, program, was, unity, of, all, the, visual, and, plastic, arts, from, architecture, and, painting, to, weaving, and, stained, glass, this, philosophy, had, grown, from, the, ideas, of, the, arts, and, crafts, movement, in, england, and, the, deutscher, werkbund, among, the, teachers, were, paul, klee, wassily, kandinsky, johannes, itten, josef, albers, anni, albers, and, l, szl, moholy, nagy, in, 1925, the, school, was, moved, to, dessau, and, as, the, nazi, party, gained, control, in, 1932, the, bauhaus, was, closed, in, 1937, an, exhibition, of, degenerate, art, entartete, kunst, contained, all, types, of, avant, garde, art, disapproved, of, by, the, nazi, party, then, the, exodus, began, not, just, from, the, bauhaus, but, from, europe, in, general, to, paris, london, and, america, paul, klee, went, to, switzerland, but, many, of, the, artists, at, the, bauhaus, went, to, america, during, the, 1930s, paris, became, the, host, to, artists, from, russia, germany, the, netherlands, and, other, european, countries, affected, by, the, rise, of, totalitarianism, sophie, tauber, and, jean, arp, collaborated, on, paintings, and, sculpture, using, organic, geometric, forms, the, polish, katarzyna, kobro, applied, mathematically, based, ideas, to, sculpture, the, many, types, of, abstraction, now, in, close, proximity, led, to, attempts, by, artists, to, analyse, the, various, conceptual, and, aesthetic, groupings, an, exhibition, by, forty, six, members, of, the, cercle, et, carr, group, organized, by, joaqu, n, torres, garc, a, assisted, by, michel, seuphor, contained, work, by, the, neo, plasticists, as, well, as, abstractionists, as, varied, as, kandinsky, anton, pevsner, and, kurt, schwitters, criticized, by, theo, van, doesburg, to, be, too, indefinite, a, collection, he, published, the, journal, art, concret, setting, out, a, manifesto, defining, an, abstract, art, in, which, the, line, color, and, surface, only, are, the, concrete, reality, abstraction, cr, ation, founded, in, 1931, as, a, more, open, group, provided, a, point, of, reference, for, abstract, artists, as, the, political, situation, worsened, in, 1935, and, artists, again, regrouped, many, in, london, the, first, exhibition, of, british, abstract, art, was, held, in, england, in, 1935, the, following, year, the, more, international, abstract, and, concrete, exhibition, was, organized, by, nicolete, gray, including, work, by, piet, mondrian, joan, mir, barbara, hepworth, and, ben, nicholson, hepworth, nicholson, and, gabo, moved, to, the, st, ives, in, cornwall, to, continue, their, constructivist, work, during, the, nazi, rise, to, power, in, the, 1930s, many, artists, fled, europe, to, the, united, states, by, the, early, 1940s, the, main, movements, in, modern, art, expressionism, cubism, abstraction, surrealism, and, dada, were, represented, in, new, york, marcel, duchamp, fernand, l, ger, piet, mondrian, jacques, lipchitz, andr, masson, max, ernst, and, andr, breton, were, just, a, few, of, the, exiled, europeans, who, arrived, in, new, york, the, rich, cultural, influences, brought, by, the, european, artists, were, distilled, and, built, upon, by, local, new, york, painters, the, climate, of, freedom, in, new, york, allowed, all, of, these, influences, to, flourish, the, art, galleries, that, primarily, had, focused, on, european, art, began, to, notice, the, local, art, community, and, the, work, of, younger, american, artists, who, had, begun, to, mature, certain, artists, at, this, time, became, distinctly, abstract, in, their, mature, work, during, this, period, piet, mondrian, s, painting, composition, no, 10, 1939, 1942, characterized, by, primary, colors, white, ground, and, black, grid, lines, clearly, defined, his, radical, but, classical, approach, to, the, rectangle, and, abstract, art, in, general, some, artists, of, the, period, defied, categorization, such, as, georgia, o, keeffe, who, while, a, modernist, abstractionist, was, a, pure, maverick, in, that, she, painted, highly, abstract, forms, while, not, joining, any, specific, group, of, the, period, eventually, american, artists, who, were, working, in, a, great, diversity, of, styles, began, to, coalesce, into, cohesive, stylistic, groups, the, best, known, group, of, american, artists, became, known, as, the, abstract, expressionists, and, the, new, york, school, in, new, york, city, there, was, an, atmosphere, which, encouraged, discussion, and, there, was, a, new, opportunity, for, learning, and, growing, artists, and, teachers, john, d, graham, and, hans, hofmann, became, important, bridge, figures, between, the, newly, arrived, european, modernists, and, the, younger, american, artists, coming, of, age, mark, rothko, born, in, russia, began, with, strongly, surrealist, imagery, which, later, dissolved, into, his, powerful, color, compositions, of, the, early, 1950s, the, expressionistic, gesture, and, the, act, of, painting, itself, became, of, primary, importance, to, jackson, pollock, robert, motherwell, and, franz, kline, while, during, the, 1940s, arshile, gorky, s, and, willem, de, kooning, s, figurative, work, evolved, into, abstraction, by, the, end, of, the, decade, new, york, city, became, the, center, and, artists, worldwide, gravitated, towards, it, from, other, places, in, america, as, well, digital, art, hard, edge, painting, geometric, abstraction, minimalism, lyrical, abstraction, op, art, abstract, expressionism, color, field, painting, monochrome, painting, assemblage, neo, dada, shaped, canvas, painting, are, a, few, directions, relating, to, abstraction, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, in, the, united, states, art, as, object, as, seen, in, the, minimalist, sculpture, of, donald, judd, and, the, paintings, of, frank, stella, are, seen, today, as, newer, permutations, other, examples, include, lyrical, abstraction, and, the, sensuous, use, of, color, seen, in, the, work, of, painters, as, diverse, as, robert, motherwell, patrick, heron, kenneth, noland, sam, francis, cy, twombly, richard, diebenkorn, helen, frankenthaler, joan, mitchell, and, veronica, ruiz, de, velasco, one, socio, historical, explanation, that, has, been, offered, for, the, growing, prevalence, of, the, abstract, in, modern, art, an, explanation, linked, to, the, name, of, theodor, w, adorno, is, that, such, abstraction, is, a, response, to, and, a, reflection, of, the, growing, abstraction, of, social, relations, in, industrial, society, frederic, jameson, similarly, sees, modernist, abstraction, as, a, function, of, the, abstract, power, of, money, equating, all, things, equally, as, exchange, values, the, social, content, of, abstract, art, is, then, precisely, the, abstract, nature, of, social, existence, legal, formalities, bureaucratic, impersonalization, information, power, in, the, world, of, late, modernity, by, contrast, post, jungians, would, see, the, quantum, theories, with, their, disintegration, of, conventional, ideas, of, form, and, matter, as, underlying, the, divorce, of, the, concrete, and, the, abstract, in, modern, art
