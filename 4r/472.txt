mask, covers, an, actor, s, facial, expressions, the, use, of, the, mask, in, noh, is, not, an, abandonment, of, facial, expressions, altogether, rather, its, intent, is, to, stylize, and, codify, the, facial, expressions, through, the, use, of, the, mask, and, to, stimulate, the, imagination, of, the, audience, by, using, masks, actors, are, able, to, convey, emotions, in, a, more, controlled,

konparu, school, the, mask, was, carved, by, the, legendary, regent, prince, sh, toku, 572, 622, over, a, thousand, years, ago, while, the, historical, accuracy, of, the, legend, of, prince, sh, toku, s, mask, may, be, contested, the, legend, itself, is, ancient, as, it, is, first, recorded, in, zeami, s, style, and, the, flower, written, in, the, 14th, century, 11, some, of, the, masks, of, the, konparu, school, belong, to, the, tokyo, national, museum, and, are, exhibited, there, frequently, the, traditional, noh, stage, butai, has, complete, openness, that, provides, a, shared, experience, between, the, performers, and, the, audience, throughout, the, performance, without, any, proscenium, or, curtains, to, obstruct, the, view, the, audience, sees, each, actor, even, during, the, moments, before, they, enter, and, after, they, exit, the, central, stage, honbutai, main, stage, the, theatre, itself, is, considered, symbolic, and, treated, with, reverence, both, by, the, performers, and, the, audience, one, of, the, most, recognizable, characteristic, of, noh, stage, is, its, independent, roof, that, hangs, over, the, stage, even, in, indoor, theatres, supported, by, four, columns, the, roof, symbolizes, the, sanctity, of, the, stage, with, its, architectural, design, derived, from, the, worship, pavilion, haiden, or, sacred, dance, pavilion, kagura, den, of, shinto, shrines, the, roof, also, unifies, the, theatre, space, and, defines, the, stage, as, an, architectural, entity, the, pillars, supporting, the, roof, are, named, shitebashira, principal, character, s, pillar, metsukebashira, gazing, pillar, wakibashira, secondary, character, s, pillar, and, fuebashira, flute, pillar, clockwise, from, upstage, right, respectively, each, pillar, is, associated, with, the, performers, and, their, actions, the, stage, is, made, entirely, of, unfinished, hinoki, japanese, cypress, with, almost, no, decorative, elements, the, poet, and, novelist, t, son, shimazaki, writes, that, on, the, stage, of, the, noh, theatre, there, are, no, sets, that, change, with, each, piece, neither, is, there, a, curtain, there, is, only, a, simple, panel, kagami, ita, with, a, painting, of, a, green, pine, tree, this, creates, the, impression, that, anything, that, could, provide, any, shading, has, been, banished, to, break, such, monotony, and, make, something, happen, is, no, easy, thing, another, unique, feature, of, the, stage, is, the, hashigakari, a, narrow, bridge, at, upstage, right, used, by, actors, to, enter, the, stage, hashigakari, means, suspension, bridge, signifying, something, aerial, that, connects, two, separate, worlds, on, a, same, level, the, bridge, symbolizes, the, mythic, nature, of, noh, plays, in, which, otherworldly, ghosts, and, spirits, frequently, appear, in, contrast, hanamichi, in, kabuki, theatres, is, literally, a, path, michi, that, connects, two, spaces, in, a, single, world, thus, has, a, completely, different, significance, noh, actors, wear, silk, costumes, called, shozoku, robes, along, with, wigs, hats, and, props, such, as, the, fan, with, striking, colors, elaborate, texture, and, intricate, weave, and, embroidery, noh, robes, are, truly, works, of, art, in, their, own, right, costumes, for, the, shite, in, particular, are, extravagant, shimmering, silk, brocades, but, are, progressively, less, sumptuous, for, the, tsure, the, wakizure, and, the, aiky, gen, for, centuries, in, accordance, with, the, vision, of, zeami, noh, costumes, emulated, the, clothing, that, the, characters, would, genuinely, wear, such, as, the, formal, robes, for, a, courtier, and, the, street, clothing, for, a, peasant, or, commoner, but, in, the, late, sixteenth, century, the, costumes, became, stylized, with, certain, symbolic, and, stylistic, conventions, during, the, edo, tokugawa, period, the, elaborate, robes, given, to, actors, by, noblemen, and, samurai, in, the, muromachi, period, were, developed, as, costumes, the, musicians, and, chorus, typically, wear, formal, montsuki, kimono, black, and, adorned, with, five, family, crests, accompanied, by, either, hakama, a, skirt, like, garment, or, kami, shimo, a, combination, of, hakama, and, a, waist, coat, with, exaggerated, shoulders, finally, the, stage, attendants, are, garbed, in, virtually, unadorned, black, garments, much, in, the, same, way, as, stagehands, in, contemporary, western, theatre, the, use, of, props, in, noh, is, minimalistic, and, stylized, the, most, commonly, used, prop, in, noh, is, the, fan, as, it, is, carried, by, all, performers, regardless, of, role, chorus, singers, and, musicians, may, carry, their, fan, in, hand, when, entering, the, stage, or, carry, it, tucked, into, the, obi, the, sash, the, fan, is, usually, placed, at, the, performer, s, side, when, he, or, she, takes, position, and, is, often, not, taken, up, again, until, leaving, the, stage, during, dance, sequences, the, fan, is, typically, used, to, represent, any, and, all, hand, held, props, such, as, a, sword, wine, jug, flute, or, writing, brush, the, fan, may, represent, various, objects, over, the, course, of, a, single, play, when, hand, props, other, than, fans, are, used, they, are, usually, introduced, or, retrieved, by, kuroko, who, fulfill, a, similar, role, to, stage, crew, in, contemporary, theatre, like, their, western, counterparts, stage, attendants, for, noh, traditionally, dress, in, black, but, unlike, in, western, theatre, they, may, appear, on, stage, during, a, scene, or, may, remain, on, stage, during, an, entire, performance, in, both, cases, in, plain, view, of, the, audience, the, all, black, costume, of, kuroko, implies, they, are, not, part, of, the, action, on, stage, and, are, effectively, invisible, set, pieces, in, noh, such, as, the, boats, wells, altars, and, bells, are, typically, carried, onto, the, stage, before, the, beginning, of, the, act, in, which, they, are, needed, these, props, normally, are, only, outlines, to, suggest, actual, objects, although, the, great, bell, a, perennial, exception, to, most, noh, rules, for, props, is, designed, to, conceal, the, actor, and, to, allow, a, costume, change, during, the, ky, gen, interlude, noh, theatre, is, accompanied, by, a, chorus, and, a, hayashi, ensemble, noh, bayashi, noh, is, a, chanted, drama, and, a, few, commentators, have, dubbed, it, japanese, opera, however, the, singing, in, noh, involves, a, limited, tonal, range, with, lengthy, repetitive, passages, in, a, narrow, dynamic, range, texts, are, poetic, relying, heavily, on, the, japanese, seven, five, rhythm, common, to, nearly, all, forms, of, japanese, poetry, with, an, economy, of, expression, and, an, abundance, of, allusion, the, singing, parts, of, noh, are, called, utai, and, the, speaking, parts, kataru, the, music, has, many, blank, spaces, ma, in, between, the, actual, sounds, and, these, negative, blank, spaces, are, in, fact, considered, the, heart, of, the, music, in, addition, to, utai, noh, hayashi, ensemble, consists, of, four, musicians, also, known, as, the, hayashi, kata, including, three, drummers, which, play, the, shime, daiko, tsuzumi, hip, drum, and, kotsuzumi, shoulder, drum, respectively, and, a, nohkan, flutist, the, chant, is, not, always, performed, in, character, that, is, sometimes, the, actor, will, speak, lines, or, describe, events, from, the, perspective, of, another, character, or, even, a, disinterested, narrator, far, from, breaking, the, rhythm, of, the, performance, this, is, actually, in, keeping, with, the, otherworldly, feel, of, many, noh, plays, especially, in, those, characterized, as, mugen, of, the, roughly, 2000, plays, created, for, noh, that, are, known, today, about, 240, make, up, the, current, repertoire, performed, by, the, five, existing, noh, schools, the, current, repertoire, is, heavily, influenced, by, the, taste, of, aristocratic, class, in, tokugawa, period, and, does, not, necessarily, reflect, popularity, among, the, commoners, there, are, several, ways, to, classify, noh, plays, all, noh, plays, can, be, classified, into, three, broad, categories, while, genzai, noh, utilizes, internal, and, external, conflicts, to, drive, storylines, and, bring, out, emotions, mugen, noh, focuses, on, utilizing, flashbacks, of, the, past, and, the, deceased, to, invoke, emotions, additionally, all, noh, plays, may, be, categorized, by, their, style, all, noh, plays, are, divided, by, their, themes, into, the, following, five, categories, this, classification, is, considered, the, most, practical, and, is, still, used, in, formal, programming, choices, today, traditionally, a, formal, 5, play, program, is, composed, of, a, selection, from, each, of, the, groups, in, addition, to, the, above, five, okina, or, kamiuta, is, frequently, performed, at, the, very, beginning, of, the, program, especially, at, new, year, holidays, and, other, special, occasions, combining, dance, with, shinto, ritual, it, is, considered, the, oldest, type, of, noh, play, the, following, categorization, is, that, of, the, kanze, school, many, western, artists, have, been, influenced, by, noh, zeami, and, zenchiku, describe, a, number, of, distinct, qualities, that, are, thought, to, be, essential, to, the, proper, understanding, of, noh, as, an, art, form, noh, is, still, regularly, performed, today, in, public, theatres, as, well, as, private, theatres, mostly, located, in, major, cities, there,

companies, and, local, amateur, companies, in, some, regions, unique, regional, noh, such, as, ogisai, kurokawa, noh, have, developed, to, form, schools, independent, from, five, traditional, schools,
