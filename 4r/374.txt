the, classical, period, was, an, era, of, classical, music, between, roughly, 1750, and, 1820, the, classical, period, falls, between, the, baroque, and, romantic, periods, classical, music, has, a, lighter, clearer, texture, than, baroque, music, but, a, more, varying, use, of, musical, form, which, is, in, simpler, terms, the, rhythm, and, organization, of, any, given, piece, of, music, it, is, mainly, homophonic, using, a, clear, melody, line, over, a, subordinate, chordal, accompaniment, but, counterpoint, was, by, no, means, forgotten, especially, in, liturgical, vocal, music, and, later, in, the, period, secular, instrumental, music, it, also, makes, use, of, style, galant, which, emphasizes, light, elegance, in, place, of, the, baroque, s, dignified, seriousness, and, impressive, grandeur, variety, and, contrast, within, a, piece, became, more, pronounced, than, before, and, the, orchestra, increased, in, size, range, and, power, the, harpsichord, was, replaced, as, the, main, keyboard, instrument, by, the, piano, or, fortepiano, unlike, the, harpsichord, which, plucks, strings, with, quills, pianos, strike, the, strings, with, leather, covered, hammers, when, the, keys, are, pressed, which, enables, the, performer, to, play, louder, or, softer, hence, the, original, name, fortepiano, literally, loud, soft, and, play, with, more, expression, in, contrast, the, force, with, which, a, performer, plays, the, harpsichord, keys, does, not, change, the, sound, instrumental, music, was, considered, important, by, classical, period, composers, the, main, kinds, of, instrumental, music, were, the, sonata, trio, string, quartet, quintet, symphony, performed, by, an, orchestra, and, the, solo, concerto, which, featured, a, virtuoso, solo, performer, playing, a, solo, work, for, violin, piano, flute, or, another, instrument, accompanied, by, an, orchestra, vocal, music, such, as, songs, for, a, singer, and, piano, notably, the, work, of, schubert, choral, works, and, opera, a, staged, dramatic, work, for, singers, and, orchestra, was, also, important, during, this, period, the, best, known, composers, from, this, period, are, joseph, haydn, wolfgang, amadeus, mozart, ludwig, van, beethoven, and, franz, schubert, other, names, in, this, period, include, carl, philipp, emanuel, bach, johann, christian, bach, luigi, boccherini, domenico, cimarosa, joseph, martin, kraus, muzio, clementi, christoph, willibald, gluck, carl, ditters, von, dittersdorf, andr, gr, try, pierre, alexandre, monsigny, leopold, mozart, michael, haydn, giovanni, paisiello, johann, baptist, wanhal, fran, ois, andr, danican, philidor, niccol, piccinni, antonio, salieri, etienne, nicolas, mehul, georg, christoph, wagenseil, johann, simon, mayr, georg, matthias, monn, johann, gottlieb, graun, carl, heinrich, graun, franz, benda, georg, anton, benda, johann, georg, albrechtsberger, mauro, giuliani, christian, cannabich, and, the, chevalier, de, saint, georges, beethoven, is, regarded, either, as, a, romantic, composer, or, a, classical, period, composer, who, was, part, of, the, transition, to, the, romantic, era, schubert, is, also, a, transitional, figure, as, were, johann, nepomuk, hummel, luigi, cherubini, gaspare, spontini, gioachino, rossini, carl, maria, von, weber, jan, ladislav, dussek, and, niccol, paganini, the, period, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, era, of, viennese, classicism, german, wiener, klassik, since, gluck, haydn, salieri, mozart, beethoven, and, schubert, all, worked, in, vienna, in, the, middle, of, the, 18th, century, europe, began, to, move, toward, a, new, style, in, architecture, literature, and, the, arts, generally, known, as, neoclassicism, this, style, sought, to, emulate, the, ideals, of, classical, antiquity, especially, those, of, classical, greece, classical, music, used, formality, and, emphasis, on, order, and, hierarchy, and, a, clearer, cleaner, style, that, used, clearer, divisions, between, parts, notably, a, clear, single, melody, accompanied, by, chords, brighter, contrasts, and, tone, colors, achieved, by, the, use, of, dynamic, changes, and, modulations, to, more, keys, in, contrast, with, the, richly, layered, music, of, the, baroque, era, classical, music, moved, towards, simplicity, rather, than, complexity, in, addition, the, typical, size, of, orchestras, began, to, increase, giving, orchestras, a, more, powerful, sound, the, remarkable, development, of, ideas, in, natural, philosophy, had, already, established, itself, in, the, public, consciousness, in, particular, newton, s, physics, was, taken, as, a, paradigm, structures, should, be, well, founded, in, axioms, and, be, both, well, articulated, and, orderly, this, taste, for, structural, clarity, began, to, affect, music, which, moved, away, from, the, layered, polyphony, of, the, baroque, period, toward, a, style, known, as, homophony, in, which, the, melody, is, played, over, a, subordinate, harmony, this, move, meant, that, chords, became, a, much, more, prevalent, feature, of, music, even, if, they, interrupted, the, melodic, smoothness, of, a, single, part, as, a, result, the, tonal, structure, of, a, piece, of, music, became, more, audible, the, new, style, was, also, encouraged, by, changes, in, the, economic, order, and, social, structure, as, the, 18th, century, progressed, well, the, nobility, became, the, primary, patrons, of, instrumental, music, while, public, taste, increasingly, preferred, lighter, funny, comic, operas, this, led, to, changes, in, the, way, music, was, performed, the, most, crucial, of, which, was, the, move, to, standard, instrumental, groups, and, the, reduction, in, the, importance, of, the, continuo, the, rhythmic, and, harmonic, groundwork, of, a, piece, of, music, typically, played, by, a, keyboard, harpsichord, or, organ, and, usually, accompanied, by, a, varied, group, of, bass, instruments, including, cello, double, bass, bass, viol, and, theorbo, one, way, to, trace, the, decline, of, the, continuo, and, its, figured, chords, is, to, examine, the, disappearance, of, the, term, obbligato, meaning, a, mandatory, instrumental, part, in, a, work, of, chamber, music, in, baroque, compositions, additional, instruments, could, be, added, to, the, continuo, group, according, to, the, group, or, leader, s, preference, in, classical, compositions, all, parts, were, specifically, noted, though, not, always, notated, so, the, term, obbligato, became, redundant, by, 1800, basso, continuo, was, practically, extinct, except, for, the, occasional, use, of, a, pipe, organ, continuo, part, in, a, religious, mass, in, the, early, 1800s, economic, changes, also, had, the, effect, of, altering, the, balance, of, availability, and, quality, of, musicians, while, in, the, late, baroque, a, major, composer, would, have, the, entire, musical, resources, of, a, town, to, draw, on, the, musical, forces, available, at, an, aristocratic, hunting, lodge, or, small, court, were, smaller, and, more, fixed, in, their, level, of, ability, this, was, a, spur, to, having, simpler, parts, for, ensemble, musicians, to, play, and, in, the, case, of, a, resident, virtuoso, group, a, spur, to, writing, spectacular, idiomatic, parts, for, certain, instruments, as, in, the, case, of, the, mannheim, orchestra, or, virtuoso, solo, parts, for, particularly, skilled, violinists, or, flutists, in, addition, the, appetite, by, audiences, for, a, continual, supply, of, new, music, carried, over, from, the, baroque, this, meant, that, works, had, to, be, performable, with, at, best, one, or, two, rehearsals, even, after, 1790, mozart, writes, about, the, rehearsal, with, the, implication, that, his, concerts, would, have, only, one, rehearsal, since, there, was, a, greater, emphasis, on, a, single, melodic, line, there, was, greater, emphasis, on, notating, that, line, for, dynamics, and, phrasing, this, contrasts, with, the, baroque, era, when, melodies, were, typically, written, with, no, dynamics, phrasing, marks, ornaments, as, it, was, assumed, that, the, performer, would, improvise, these, elements, on, the, spot, in, the, classical, era, it, became, more, common, for, composers, to, indicate, where, they, wanted, performers, to, play, ornaments, such, as, trills, or, turns, the, simplification, of, texture, made, such, instrumental, detail, more, important, and, alit, so, made, the, use, of, characteristic, rhythms, such, as, attention, getting, opening, fanfares, the, funeral, march, rhythm, or, the, minuet, genre, more, important, in, establishing, and, unifying, the, tone, of, a, single, movement, the, classical, period, also, saw, the, gradual, development, of, sonata, form, a, set, of, structural, principles, for, music, that, reconciled, the, classical, preference, for, melodic, material, with, harmonic, development, which, could, be, applied, across, musical, genres, the, sonata, itself, continued, to, be, the, principal, form, for, solo, and, chamber, music, while, later, in, the, classical, period, the, string, quartet, became, a, prominent, genre, the, symphony, form, for, orchestra, was, created, in, this, period, this, is, popularly, attributed, to, joseph, haydn, the, concerto, grosso, a, concerto, for, more, than, one, musician, a, very, popular, form, in, the, baroque, era, began, to, be, replaced, by, the, solo, concerto, featuring, only, one, soloist, composers, began, to, place, more, importance, on, the, particular, soloist, s, ability, to, show, off, virtuoso, skills, with, challenging, fast, scale, and, arpeggio, runs, nonetheless, some, concerti, grossi, remained, the, most, famous, of, which, was, mozart, s, sinfonia, concertante, for, violin, and, viola, in, e, flat, major, in, the, classical, period, the, theme, consists, of, phrases, with, contrasting, melodic, figures, and, rhythms, these, phrases, are, relatively, brief, typically, four, bars, in, length, and, can, occasionally, seem, sparse, or, terse, the, texture, is, mainly, homophonic, with, a, clear, melody, above, a, subordinate, chordal, accompaniment, for, instance, an, alberti, bass, this, contrasts, with, the, practice, in, baroque, music, where, a, piece, or, movement, would, typically, have, only, one, musical, subject, which, would, then, be, worked, out, in, a, number, of, voices, according, to, the, principles, of, counterpoint, while, maintaining, a, consistent, rhythm, or, metre, throughout, as, a, result, classical, music, tends, to, have, a, lighter, clearer, texture, than, the, baroque, the, classical, style, draws, on, the, style, galant, a, musical, style, which, emphasized, light, elegance, in, place, of, the, baroque, s, dignified, seriousness, and, impressive, grandeur, structurally, classical, music, generally, has, a, clear, musical, form, with, a, well, defined, contrast, between, tonic, and, dominant, introduced, by, clear, cadences, dynamics, are, used, to, highlight, the, structural, characteristics, of, the, piece, in, particular, sonata, form, and, its, variants, were, developed, during, the, early, classical, period, and, was, frequently, used, the, classical, approach, to, structure, again, contrasts, with, the, baroque, where, a, composition, would, normally, move, between, tonic, and, dominant, and, back, again, but, through, a, continual, progress, of, chord, changes, and, without, a, sense, of, arrival, at, the, new, key, while, counterpoint, was, less, emphasised, in, the, classical, period, it, was, by, no, means, forgotten, especially, later, in, the, period, and, composers, still, used, counterpoint, in, serious, works, such, as, symphonies, and, string, quartets, as, well, as, religious, pieces, such, as, masses, the, classical, musical, style, was, supported, by, technical, developments, in, instruments, the, widespread, adoption, of, equal, temperament, made, classical, musical, structure, possible, by, ensuring, that, cadences, in, all, keys, sounded, similar, the, fortepiano, and, then, the, pianoforte, replaced, the, harpsichord, enabling, more, dynamic, contrast, and, more, sustained, melodies, over, the, classical, period, keyboard, instruments, became, richer, more, sonorous, and, more, powerful, the, orchestra, increased, in, size, and, range, and, became, more, standardised, the, harpsichord, or, pipe, organ, basso, continuo, role, in, orchestra, fell, out, of, use, between, 1750, and, 1775, leaving, the, string, section, woodwinds, became, a, self, contained, section, consisting, of, clarinets, oboes, flutes, and, bassoons, while, vocal, music, such, as, comic, opera, was, popular, great, importance, was, given, to, instrumental, music, the, main, kinds, of, instrumental, music, were, the, sonata, trio, string, quartet, quintet, symphony, concerto, usually, for, a, virtuoso, solo, instrument, accompanied, by, orchestra, and, light, pieces, such, as, serenades, and, divertimentos, sonata, form, developed, and, became, the, most, important, form, it, was, used, to, build, up, the, first, movement, of, most, large, scale, works, in, symphonies, and, string, quartets, sonata, form, was, also, used, in, other, movements, and, in, single, standalone, pieces, such, as, overtures, in, his, book, the, classical, style, author, and, pianist, charles, rosen, claims, that, from, 1755, to, 1775, composers, groped, for, a, new, style, that, was, more, effectively, dramatic, in, the, high, baroque, period, dramatic, expression, was, limited, to, the, representation, of, individual, affects, the, doctrine, of, affections, or, what, rosen, terms, dramatic, sentiment, for, example, in, handel, s, oratorio, jephtha, the, composer, renders, four, emotions, separately, one, for, each, character, in, the, quartet, o, spare, your, daughter, eventually, this, depiction, of, individual, emotions, came, to, be, seen, as, simplistic, and, unrealistic, composers, sought, to, portray, multiple, emotions, simultaneously, or, progressively, within, a, single, character, or, movement, dramatic, action, thus, in, the, finale, of, act, 2, of, mozart, s, die, entf, hrung, aus, dem, serail, the, lovers, move, from, joy, through, suspicion, and, outrage, to, final, reconciliation, musically, speaking, this, dramatic, action, required, more, musical, variety, whereas, baroque, music, was, characterized, by, seamless, flow, within, individual, movements, and, largely, uniform, textures, composers, after, the, high, baroque, sought, to, interrupt, this, flow, with, abrupt, changes, in, texture, dynamic, harmony, or, tempo, among, the, stylistic, developments, which, followed, the, high, baroque, the, most, dramatic, came, to, be, called, empfindsamkeit, roughly, sensitive, style, and, its, best, known, practitioner, was, carl, philipp, emanuel, bach, composers, of, this, style, employed, the, above, discussed, interruptions, in, the, most, abrupt, manner, and, the, music, can, sound, illogical, at, times, the, italian, composer, domenico, scarlatti, took, these, developments, further, his, more, than, five, hundred, single, movement, keyboard, sonatas, also, contain, abrupt, changes, of, texture, but, these, changes, are, organized, into, periods, balanced, phrases, that, became, a, hallmark, of, the, classical, style, however, scarlatti, s, changes, in, texture, still, sound, sudden, and, unprepared, the, outstanding, achievement, of, the, great, classical, composers, haydn, mozart, and, beethoven, was, their, ability, to, make, these, dramatic, surprises, sound, logically, motivated, so, that, the, expressive, and, the, elegant, could, join, hands, between, the, death, of, j, s, bach, and, the, maturity, of, haydn, and, mozart, roughly, 1750, 1770, composers, experimented, with, these, new, ideas, which, can, be, seen, in, the, music, of, bach, s, sons, johann, christian, developed, a, style, which, we, now, call, roccoco, comprising, simpler, textures, and, harmonies, and, which, was, charming, undramatic, and, a, little, empty, as, mentioned, previously, carl, philipp, emmanuel, sought, to, increase, drama, and, his, music, was, violent, expressive, brilliant, continuously, surprising, and, often, incoherent, and, finally, wilhelm, friedemann, j, s, bach, s, eldest, son, extended, baroque, traditions, in, an, idiomatic, unconventional, way, at, first, the, new, style, took, over, baroque, forms, the, ternary, da, capo, aria, the, sinfonia, and, the, concerto, but, composed, with, simpler, parts, more, notated, ornamentation, rather, than, the, improvised, ornaments, that, were, common, in, the, baroque, era, and, more, emphatic, division, of, pieces, into, sections, however, over, time, the, new, aesthetic, caused, radical, changes, in, how, pieces, were, put, together, and, the, basic, formal, layouts, changed, composers, from, this, period, sought, dramatic, effects, striking, melodies, and, clearer, textures, one, of, the, big, textural, changes, was, a, shift, away, from, the, complex, dense, polyphonic, style, of, the, baroque, in, which, multiple, interweaving, melodic, lines, were, played, simultaneously, and, towards, homophony, a, lighter, texture, which, uses, a, clear, single, melody, line, accompanied, by, chords, baroque, music, generally, uses, many, harmonic, fantasies, and, polyphonic, sections, that, focus, less, on, the, structure, of, the, musical, piece, and, there, was, less, emphasis, on, clear, musical, phrases, in, the, classical, period, the, harmonies, became, simpler, however, the, structure, of, the, piece, the, phrases, and, small, melodic, or, rhythmic, motives, became, much, more, important, than, in, the, baroque, period, another, important, break, with, the, past, was, the, radical, overhaul, of, opera, by, christoph, willibald, gluck, who, cut, away, a, great, deal, of, the, layering, and, improvisational, ornaments, and, focused, on, the, points, of, modulation, and, transition, by, making, these, moments, where, the, harmony, changes, more, of, a, focus, he, enabled, powerful, dramatic, shifts, in, the, emotional, color, of, the, music, to, highlight, these, transitions, he, used, changes, in, instrumentation, orchestration, melody, and, mode, among, the, most, successful, composers, of, his, time, gluck, spawned, many, emulators, including, antonio, salieri, their, emphasis, on, accessibility, brought, huge, successes, in, opera, and, in, other, vocal, music, such, as, songs, oratorios, and, choruses, these, were, considered, the, most, important, kinds, of, music, for, performance, and, hence, enjoyed, greatest, public, success, the, phase, between, the, baroque, and, the, rise, of, the, classical, around, 1730, was, home, to, various, competing, musical, styles, the, diversity, of, artistic, paths, are, represented, in, the, sons, of, johann, sebastian, bach, wilhelm, friedemann, bach, who, continued, the, baroque, tradition, in, a, personal, way, johann, christian, bach, who, simplified, textures, of, the, baroque, and, most, clearly, influenced, mozart, and, carl, philipp, emanuel, bach, who, composed, passionate, and, sometimes, violently, eccentric, music, of, the, empfindsamkeit, movement, musical, culture, was, caught, at, a, crossroads, the, masters, of, the, older, style, had, the, technique, but, the, public, hungered, for, the, new, this, is, one, of, the, reasons, c, p, e, bach, was, held, in, such, high, regard, he, understood, the, older, forms, quite, well, and, knew, how, to, present, them, in, new, garb, with, an, enhanced, variety, of, form, by, the, late, 1750s, there, were, flourishing, centers, of, the, new, style, in, italy, vienna, mannheim, and, paris, dozens, of, symphonies, were, composed, and, there, were, bands, of, players, associated, with, musical, theatres, opera, or, other, vocal, music, accompanied, by, orchestra, was, the, feature, of, most, musical, events, with, concertos, and, symphonies, arising, from, the, overture, serving, as, instrumental, interludes, and, introductions, for, operas, and, church, services, over, the, course, of, the, classical, period, symphonies, and, concertos, developed, and, were, presented, independently, of, vocal, music, the, normal, orchestra, ensemble, a, body, of, strings, supplemented, by, winds, and, movements, of, particular, rhythmic, character, were, established, by, the, late, 1750s, in, vienna, however, the, length, and, weight, of, pieces, was, still, set, with, some, baroque, characteristics, individual, movements, still, focused, on, one, affect, musical, mood, or, had, only, one, sharply, contrasting, middle, section, and, their, length, was, not, significantly, greater, than, baroque, movements, there, was, not, yet, a, clearly, enunciated, theory, of, how, to, compose, in, the, new, style, it, was, a, moment, ripe, for, a, breakthrough, the, first, great, master, of, the, style, was, the, composer, joseph, haydn, in, the, late, 1750s, he, began, composing, symphonies, and, by, 1761, he, had, composed, a, triptych, morning, noon, and, evening, solidly, in, the, contemporary, mode, as, a, vice, kapellmeister, and, later, kapellmeister, his, output, expanded, he, composed, over, forty, symphonies, in, the, 1760s, alone, and, while, his, fame, grew, as, his, orchestra, was, expanded, and, his, compositions, were, copied, and, disseminated, his, voice, was, only, one, among, many, while, some, scholars, suggest, that, haydn, was, later, overshadowed, by, mozart, and, beethoven, it, would, be, difficult, to, overstate, haydn, s, centrality, to, the, new, style, and, therefore, to, the, future, of, western, art, music, as, a, whole, at, the, time, before, the, pre, eminence, of, mozart, or, beethoven, and, with, johann, sebastian, bach, known, primarily, to, connoisseurs, of, keyboard, music, haydn, reached, a, place, in, music, that, set, him, above, all, other, composers, except, perhaps, the, baroque, era, s, george, frideric, handel, haydn, took, existing, ideas, and, radically, altered, how, they, functioned, earning, him, the, titles, father, of, the, symphony, and, father, of, the, string, quartet, one, of, the, forces, that, worked, as, an, impetus, for, his, pressing, forward, was, the, first, stirring, of, what, would, later, be, called, romanticism, the, sturm, und, drang, or, storm, and, stress, phase, in, the, arts, a, short, period, where, obvious, and, dramatic, emotionalism, was, a, stylistic, preference, haydn, accordingly, wanted, more, dramatic, contrast, and, more, emotionally, appealing, melodies, with, sharpened, character, and, individuality, in, his, pieces, this, period, faded, away, in, music, and, literature, however, it, influenced, what, came, afterward, and, would, eventually, be, a, component, of, aesthetic, taste, in, later, decades, the, farewell, symphony, no, 45, in, f, minor, exemplifies, haydn, s, integration, of, the, differing, demands, of, the, new, style, with, surprising, sharp, turns, and, a, long, slow, adagio, to, end, the, work, in, 1772, haydn, completed, his, opus, 20, set, of, six, string, quartets, in, which, he, deployed, the, polyphonic, techniques, he, had, gathered, from, the, previous, baroque, era, to, provide, structural, coherence, capable, of, holding, together, his, melodic, ideas, for, some, this, marks, the, beginning, of, the, mature, classical, style, a, transitional, period, in, which, reaction, against, late, baroque, complexity, yielded, to, integration, of, baroque, and, classical, elements, haydn, having, worked, for, over, a, decade, as, the, music, director, for, a, prince, had, far, more, resources, and, scope, for, composing, than, most, other, composers, his, position, also, gave, him, the, ability, to, shape, the, forces, that, would, play, his, music, as, he, could, select, skilled, musicians, this, opportunity, was, not, wasted, as, haydn, beginning, quite, early, on, his, career, sought, to, press, forward, the, technique, of, building, and, developing, ideas, in, his, music, his, next, important, breakthrough, was, in, the, opus, 33, string, quartets, 1781, in, which, the, melodic, and, the, harmonic, roles, segue, among, the, instruments, it, is, often, momentarily, unclear, what, is, melody, and, what, is, harmony, this, changes, the, way, the, ensemble, works, its, way, between, dramatic, moments, of, transition, and, climactic, sections, the, music, flows, smoothly, and, without, obvious, interruption, he, then, took, this, integrated, style, and, began, applying, it, to, orchestral, and, vocal, music, haydn, s, gift, to, music, was, a, way, of, composing, a, way, of, structuring, works, which, was, at, the, same, time, in, accord, with, the, governing, aesthetic, of, the, new, style, however, a, younger, contemporary, wolfgang, amadeus, mozart, brought, his, genius, to, haydn, s, ideas, and, applied, them, to, two, of, the, major, genres, of, the, day, opera, and, the, virtuoso, concerto, whereas, haydn, spent, much, of, his, working, life, as, a, court, composer, mozart, wanted, public, success, in, the, concert, life, of, cities, playing, for, the, general, public, this, meant, he, needed, to, write, operas, and, write, and, perform, virtuoso, pieces, haydn, was, not, a, virtuoso, at, the, international, touring, level, nor, was, he, seeking, to, create, operatic, works, that, could, play, for, many, nights, in, front, of, a, large, audience, mozart, wanted, to, achieve, both, moreover, mozart, also, had, a, taste, for, more, chromatic, chords, and, greater, contrasts, in, harmonic, language, generally, a, greater, love, for, creating, a, welter, of, melodies, in, a, single, work, and, a, more, italianate, sensibility, in, music, as, a, whole, he, found, in, haydn, s, music, and, later, in, his, study, of, the, polyphony, of, j, s, bach, the, means, to, discipline, and, enrich, his, artistic, gifts, mozart, rapidly, came, to, the, attention, of, haydn, who, hailed, the, new, composer, studied, his, works, and, considered, the, younger, man, his, only, true, peer, in, music, in, mozart, haydn, found, a, greater, range, of, instrumentation, dramatic, effect, and, melodic, resource, the, learning, relationship, moved, in, both, directions, mozart, also, had, a, great, respect, for, the, older, more, experienced, composer, and, sought, to, learn, from, him, mozart, s, arrival, in, vienna, in, 1780, brought, an, acceleration, in, the, development, of, the, classical, style, there, mozart, absorbed, the, fusion, of, italianate, brilliance, and, germanic, cohesiveness, that, had, been, brewing, for, the, previous, 20, years, his, own, taste, for, flashy, brilliances, rhythmically, complex, melodies, and, figures, long, cantilena, melodies, and, virtuoso, flourishes, was, merged, with, an, appreciation, for, formal, coherence, and, internal, connectedness, it, is, at, this, point, that, war, and, economic, inflation, halted, a, trend, to, larger, orchestras, and, forced, the, disbanding, or, reduction, of, many, theater, orchestras, this, pressed, the, classical, style, inwards, toward, seeking, greater, ensemble, and, technical, challenges, for, example, scattering, the, melody, across, woodwinds, or, using, a, melody, harmonized, in, thirds, this, process, placed, a, premium, on, small, ensemble, music, called, chamber, music, it, also, led, to, a, trend, for, more, public, performance, giving, a, further, boost, to, the, string, quartet, and, other, small, ensemble, groupings, it, was, during, this, decade, that, public, taste, began, increasingly, to, recognize, that, haydn, and, mozart, had, reached, a, high, standard, of, composition, by, the, time, mozart, arrived, at, age, 25, in, 1781, the, dominant, styles, of, vienna, were, recognizably, connected, to, the, emergence, in, the, 1750s, of, the, early, classical, style, by, the, end, of, the, 1780s, changes, in, performance, practice, the, relative, standing, of, instrumental, and, vocal, music, technical, demands, on, musicians, and, stylistic, unity, had, become, established, in, the, composers, who, imitated, mozart, and, haydn, during, this, decade, mozart, composed, his, most, famous, operas, his, six, late, symphonies, that, helped, to, redefine, the, genre, and, a, string, of, piano, concerti, that, still, stand, at, the, pinnacle, of, these, forms, one, composer, who, was, influential, in, spreading, the, more, serious, style, that, mozart, and, haydn, had, formed, is, muzio, clementi, a, gifted, virtuoso, pianist, who, tied, with, mozart, in, a, musical, duel, before, the, emperor, in, which, they, each, improvised, on, the, piano, and, performed, their, compositions, clementi, s, sonatas, for, the, piano, circulated, widely, and, he, became, the, most, successful, composer, in, london, during, the, 1780s, also, in, london, at, this, time, was, jan, ladislav, dussek, who, like, clementi, encouraged, piano, makers, to, extend, the, range, and, other, features, of, their, instruments, and, then, fully, exploited, the, newly, opened, up, possibilities, the, importance, of, london, in, the, classical, period, is, often, overlooked, but, it, served, as, the, home, to, the, broadwood, s, factory, for, piano, manufacturing, and, as, the, base, for, composers, who, while, less, notable, than, the, vienna, school, had, a, decisive, influence, on, what, came, later, they, were, composers, of, many, fine, works, notable, in, their, own, right, london, s, taste, for, virtuosity, may, well, have, encouraged, the, complex, passage, work, and, extended, statements, on, tonic, and, dominant, when, haydn, and, mozart, began, composing, symphonies, were, played, as, single, movements, before, between, or, as, interludes, within, other, works, and, many, of, them, lasted, only, ten, or, twelve, minutes, instrumental, groups, had, varying, standards, of, playing, and, the, continuo, was, a, central, part, of, music, making, in, the, intervening, years, the, social, world, of, music, had, seen, dramatic, changes, international, publication, and, touring, had, grown, explosively, and, concert, societies, formed, notation, became, more, specific, more, descriptive, and, schematics, for, works, had, been, simplified, yet, became, more, varied, in, their, exact, working, out, in, 1790, just, before, mozart, s, death, with, his, reputation, spreading, rapidly, haydn, was, poised, for, a, series, of, successes, notably, his, late, oratorios, and, london, symphonies, composers, in, paris, rome, and, all, over, germany, turned, to, haydn, and, mozart, for, their, ideas, on, form, in, the, 1790s, a, new, generation, of, composers, born, around, 1770, emerged, while, they, had, grown, up, with, the, earlier, styles, they, heard, in, the, recent, works, of, haydn, and, mozart, a, vehicle, for, greater, expression, in, 1788, luigi, cherubini, settled, in, paris, and, in, 1791, composed, lodoiska, an, opera, that, raised, him, to, fame, its, style, is, clearly, reflective, of, the, mature, haydn, and, mozart, and, its, instrumentation, gave, it, a, weight, that, had, not, yet, been, felt, in, the, grand, opera, his, contemporary, tienne, m, hul, extended, instrumental, effects, with, his, 1790, opera, euphrosine, et, coradin, from, which, followed, a, series, of, successes, the, final, push, towards, change, came, from, gaspare, spontini, who, was, deeply, admired, by, future, romantic, composers, such, as, weber, berlioz, and, wagner, the, innovative, harmonic, language, of, his, operas, their, refined, instrumentation, and, their, enchained, closed, numbers, a, structural, pattern, which, was, later, adopted, by, weber, in, euryanthe, and, from, him, handed, down, through, marschner, to, wagner, formed, the, basis, from, which, french, and, german, romantic, opera, had, its, beginnings, the, most, fateful, of, the, new, generation, was, ludwig, van, beethoven, who, launched, his, numbered, works, in, 1794, with, a, set, of, three, piano, trios, which, remain, in, the, repertoire, somewhat, younger, than, the, others, though, equally, accomplished, because, of, his, youthful, study, under, mozart, and, his, native, virtuosity, was, johann, nepomuk, hummel, hummel, studied, under, haydn, as, well, he, was, a, friend, to, beethoven, and, franz, schubert, he, concentrated, more, on, the, piano, than, any, other, instrument, and, his, time, in, london, in, 1791, and, 1792, generated, the, composition, and, publication, in, 1793, of, three, piano, sonatas, opus, 2, which, idiomatically, used, mozart, s, techniques, of, avoiding, the, expected, cadence, and, clementi, s, sometimes, modally, uncertain, virtuoso, figuration, taken, together, these, composers, can, be, seen, as, the, vanguard, of, a, broad, change, in, style, and, the, center, of, music, they, studied, one, another, s, works, copied, one, another, s, gestures, in, music, and, on, occasion, behaved, like, quarrelsome, rivals, the, crucial, differences, with, the, previous, wave, can, be, seen, in, the, downward, shift, in, melodies, increasing, durations, of, movements, the, acceptance, of, mozart, and, haydn, as, paradigmatic, the, greater, use, of, keyboard, resources, the, shift, from, vocal, writing, to, pianistic, writing, the, growing, pull, of, the, minor, and, of, modal, ambiguity, and, the, increasing, importance, of, varying, accompanying, figures, to, bring, texture, forward, as, an, element, in, music, in, short, the, late, classical, was, seeking, music, that, was, internally, more, complex, the, growth, of, concert, societies, and, amateur, orchestras, marking, the, importance, of, music, as, part, of, middle, class, life, contributed, to, a, booming, market, for, pianos, piano, music, and, virtuosi, to, serve, as, exemplars, hummel, beethoven, and, clementi, were, all, renowned, for, their, improvising, the, direct, influence, of, the, baroque, continued, to, fade, the, figured, bass, grew, less, prominent, as, a, means, of, holding, performance, together, the, performance, practices, of, the, mid, 18th, century, continued, to, die, out, however, at, the, same, time, complete, editions, of, baroque, masters, began, to, become, available, and, the, influence, of, baroque, style, continued, to, grow, particularly, in, the, ever, more, expansive, use, of, brass, another, feature, of, the, period, is, the, growing, number, of, performances, where, the, composer, was, not, present, this, led, to, increased, detail, and, specificity, in, notation, for, example, there, were, fewer, optional, parts, that, stood, separately, from, the, main, score, the, force, of, these, shifts, became, apparent, with, beethoven, s, 3rd, symphony, given, the, name, eroica, which, is, italian, for, heroic, by, the, composer, as, with, stravinsky, s, the, rite, of, spring, it, may, not, have, been, the, first, in, all, of, its, innovations, but, its, aggressive, use, of, every, part, of, the, classical, style, set, it, apart, from, its, contemporary, works, in, length, ambition, and, harmonic, resources, as, well, making, it, the, first, symphony, of, the, romantic, era, the, first, viennese, school, is, a, name, mostly, used, to, refer, to, three, composers, of, the, classical, period, in, late, 18th, century, vienna, haydn, mozart, and, beethoven, franz, schubert, is, occasionally, added, to, the, list, in, german, speaking, countries, the, term, wiener, klassik, lit, viennese, classical, era, art, is, used, that, term, is, often, more, broadly, applied, to, the, classical, era, in, music, as, a, whole, as, a, means, to, distinguish, it, from, other, periods, that, are, colloquially, referred, to, as, classical, namely, baroque, and, romantic, music, the, term, viennese, school, was, first, used, by, austrian, musicologist, raphael, georg, kiesewetter, in, 1834, although, he, only, counted, haydn, and, mozart, as, members, of, the, school, other, writers, followed, suit, and, eventually, beethoven, was, added, to, the, list, the, designation, first, is, added, today, to, avoid, confusion, with, the, second, viennese, school, whilst, schubert, apart, these, composers, certainly, knew, each, other, with, haydn, and, mozart, even, being, occasional, chamber, music, partners, there, is, no, sense, in, which, they, were, engaged, in, a, collaborative, effort, in, the, sense, that, one, would, associate, with, 20th, century, schools, such, as, the, second, viennese, school, or, les, six, nor, is, there, any, significant, sense, in, which, one, composer, was, schooled, by, another, in, the, way, that, berg, and, webern, were, taught, by, schoenberg, though, it, is, true, that, beethoven, for, a, time, received, lessons, from, haydn, attempts, to, extend, the, first, viennese, school, to, include, such, later, figures, as, anton, bruckner, johannes, brahms, and, gustav, mahler, are, merely, journalistic, and, never, encountered, in, academic, musicology, according, to, scholar, james, f, daugherty, the, classical, period, itself, from, approximately, 1775, to, 1825, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, viennese, classic, period, musical, eras, and, their, prevalent, styles, forms, and, instruments, seldom, disappear, at, once, instead, features, are, replaced, over, time, until, the, old, approach, is, simply, felt, as, old, fashioned, the, classical, style, did, not, die, suddenly, rather, it, gradually, got, phased, out, under, the, weight, of, changes, to, give, just, one, example, while, it, is, generally, stated, that, the, classical, era, stopped, using, the, harpsichord, in, orchestras, this, did, not, happen, all, of, a, sudden, at, the, start, of, the, classical, era, in, 1750, rather, orchestras, slowly, stopped, using, the, harpsichord, to, play, basso, continuo, until, the, practice, was, discontinued, by, the, end, of, the, 1700s, one, crucial, change, was, the, shift, towards, harmonies, centering, on, flatward, keys, shifts, in, the, subdominant, direction, in, the, classical, style, major, key, was, far, more, common, than, minor, chromaticism, being, moderated, through, the, use, of, sharpward, modulation, e, g, a, piece, in, c, major, modulating, to, g, major, d, major, or, a, major, all, of, which, are, keys, with, more, sharps, as, well, sections, in, the, minor, mode, were, often, used, for, contrast, beginning, with, mozart, and, clementi, there, began, a, creeping, colonization, of, the, subdominant, region, the, ii, or, iv, chord, which, in, the, key, of, c, major, would, be, the, keys, of, d, minor, or, f, major, with, schubert, subdominant, modulations, flourished, after, being, introduced, in, contexts, in, which, earlier, composers, would, have, confined, themselves, to, dominant, shifts, modulations, to, the, dominant, chord, e, g, in, the, key, of, c, major, modulating, to, g, major, this, introduced, darker, colors, to, music, strengthened, the, minor, mode, and, made, structure, harder, to, maintain, beethoven, contributed, to, this, by, his, increasing, use, of, the, fourth, as, a, consonance, and, modal, ambiguity, for, example, the, opening, of, the, symphony, no, 9, in, d, minor, ludwig, van, beethoven, franz, schubert, carl, maria, von, weber, johann, nepomuk, hummel, and, john, field, are, among, the, most, prominent, in, this, generation, of, proto, romantics, along, with, the, young, felix, mendelssohn, their, sense, of, form, was, strongly, influenced, by, the, classical, style, while, they, were, not, yet, learned, composers, imitating, rules, which, were, codified, by, others, they, directly, responded, to, works, by, haydn, mozart, clementi, and, others, as, they, encountered, them, the, instrumental, forces, at, their, disposal, in, orchestras, were, also, quite, classical, in, number, and, variety, permitting, similarity, with, classical, works, however, the, forces, destined, to, end, the, hold, of, the, classical, style, gathered, strength, in, the, works, of, many, of, the, above, composers, particularly, beethoven, the, most, commonly, cited, one, is, harmonic, innovation, also, important, is, the, increasing, focus, on, having, a, continuous, and, rhythmically, uniform, accompanying, figuration, beethoven, s, moonlight, sonata, was, the, model, for, hundreds, of, later, pieces, where, the, shifting, movement, of, a, rhythmic, figure, provides, much, of, the, drama, and, interest, of, the, work, while, a, melody, drifts, above, it, greater, knowledge, of, works, greater, instrumental, expertise, increasing, variety, of, instruments, the, growth, of, concert, societies, and, the, unstoppable, domination, of, the, increasingly, more, powerful, piano, which, was, given, a, bolder, louder, tone, by, technological, developments, such, as, the, use, of, steel, strings, heavy, cast, iron, frames, and, sympathetically, vibrating, strings, all, created, a, huge, audience, for, sophisticated, music, all, of, these, trends, contributed, to, the, shift, to, the, romantic, style, drawing, the, line, between, these, two, styles, is, very, difficult, some, sections, of, mozart, s, later, works, taken, alone, are, indistinguishable, in, harmony, and, orchestration, from, music, written, 80, years, later, and, some, composers, continued, to, write, in, normative, classical, styles, into, the, early, 20th, century, even, before, beethoven, s, death, composers, such, as, louis, spohr, were, self, described, romantics, incorporating, for, example, more, extravagant, chromaticism, in, their, works, e, g, using, chromatic, harmonies, in, a, piece, s, chord, progression, conversely, works, such, as, schubert, s, symphony, no, 5, written, during, the, chronological, end, of, the, classical, era, and, dawn, of, the, romantic, era, exhibit, a, deliberately, anachronistic, artistic, paradigm, harking, back, to, the, compositional, style, of, several, decades, before, however, vienna, s, fall, as, the, most, important, musical, center, for, orchestral, composition, during, the, late, 1820s, precipitated, by, the, deaths, of, beethoven, and, schubert, marked, the, classical, style, s, final, eclipse, and, the, end, of, its, continuous, organic, development, of, one, composer, learning, in, close, proximity, to, others, franz, liszt, and, fr, d, ric, chopin, visited, vienna, when, they, were, young, but, they, then, moved, on, to, other, cities, composers, such, as, carl, czerny, while, deeply, influenced, by, beethoven, also, searched, for, new, ideas, and, new, forms, to, contain, the, larger, world, of, musical, expression, and, performance, in, which, they, lived, renewed, interest, in, the, formal, balance, and, restraint, of, 18th, century, classical, music, led, in, the, early, 20th, century, to, the, development, of, so, called, neoclassical, style, which, numbered, stravinsky, and, prokofiev, among, its, proponents, at, least, at, certain, times, in, their, careers, the, baroque, guitar, with, four, or, five, sets, of, double, strings, or, courses, and, elaborately, decorated, soundhole, was, a, very, different, instrument, from, the, early, classical, guitar, which, more, closely, resembles, the, modern, instrument, with, the, standard, six, strings, judging, by, the, number, of, instructional, manuals, published, for, the, instrument, over, three, hundred, texts, were, published, by, over, two, hundred, authors, between, 1760, and, 1860, the, classical, period, marked, a, golden, age, for, guitar, in, the, baroque, era, there, was, more, variety, in, the, bowed, stringed, instruments, used, in, ensembles, with, instruments, such, as, the, viola, d, amore, and, a, range, of, fretted, viols, being, used, ranging, from, small, viols, to, large, bass, viols, in, the, classical, period, the, string, section, of, the, orchestra, was, standardized, as, just, four, instruments, in, the, baroque, era, the, double, bass, players, were, not, usually, given, a, separate, part, instead, they, typically, played, the, same, basso, continuo, bassline, that, the, cellos, and, other, low, pitched, instruments, e, g, theorbo, serpent, wind, instrument, viols, albeit, an, octave, below, the, cellos, because, the, double, bass, is, a, transposing, instrument, that, sounds, one, octave, lower, than, it, is, written, in, the, classical, era, some, composers, continued, to, write, only, one, bass, part, for, their, symphony, labeled, bassi, this, bass, part, was, played, by, cellists, and, double, bassists, during, the, classical, era, some, composers, began, to, give, the, double, basses, their, own, part, it, was, commonplace, for, all, orchestras, to, have, at, least, 2, winds, usually, oboes, flutes, clarinets, or, sometimes, english, horns, see, symphony, no, 22, haydn, patrons, also, usually, employed, an, ensemble, of, entirely, winds, called, the, harmonie, which, would, be, employed, for, certain, events, the, harmonie, would, sometimes, join, the, larger, string, orchestra, to, serve, as, the, wind, section
