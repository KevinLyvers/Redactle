baba, yaga, appears, on, a, variety, of, lubki, singular, lubok, wood, block, prints, popular, in, late, 17th, and, early, 18th, century, russia, in, some, instances, baba, yaga, appears, astride, a, pig, going, to, battle, against, a, reptilian, entity, referred, to, as, crocodile, dmitry, rovinsky, interpreted, this, scene, as, a, political, parody, peter, the, great, persecuted, old, believers, who, in, turn, referred, to, him, as, a, crocodile, rovinsky, notices, that, some, lubki, feature, a, ship, below, the, crocodile, interpreted, as, a, hint, to, the, rule, of, peter, the, great, while, baba, yaga, dressed, in, a, finnish, dress, chukhonka, dress, is, a, hint, to, peter, the, great, s, wife, catherine, i, sometimes, derisively, referred, to, as, the, chukhonka, finnish, woman, a, lubok, that, features, baba, yaga, dancing, with, a, bagpipe, playing, bald, man, has, been, identified, as, a, merrier, depiction, of, the, home, life, of, peter, and, catherine, some, other, scholars, have, interpreted, these, lubki, motifs, as, reflecting, a, concept, of, baba, yaga, as, a, shaman, the, crocodile, would, in, this, case, represent, a, monster, who, fights, witches, and, the, print, would, be, something, of, a, cultural, m, lange, that, demonstrate, an, interest, in, shamanism, at, the, time, according, to, andreas, johns, neither, of, these, two, interpretations, significantly, changes, the, image, of, baba, yaga, familiar, from, folktales, either, she, can, be, seen, as, a, literal, evil, witch, treated, somewhat, humorously, in, these, prints, or, as, a, figurative, witch, an, unpopular, foreign, empress, both, literal, and, figurative, understandings, of, baba, yaga, are, documented, in, the, nineteenth, century, and, were, probably, present, at, the, time, these, prints, were, made, je, ibaba, a, figure, closely, related, to, baba, yaga, occurs, in, the, folklore, of, the, west, slavic, peoples, the, two, figures, may, originate, from, a,

questions, linger, regarding, the, limited, slavic, area, east, slavic, nations, slovakia, and, the, czech, lands, in, which, references, to, je, ibaba, are, recorded, j, dza, another, figure, related, to, baba, yaga, appears, in, polish, folklore, similarities, between, baba, yaga, and, other, beings, in, folklore, may, be, due, to, either, direct, relation, or, cultural, contact, between, the, eastern, slavs, and, other, surrounding, peoples, in, central, and, eastern, europe, these, figures, include, the, bulgarian, gorska, maika, forest, mother, also, the, name, of, a, flower, the,
