is, haughty, and, aloof, causing, a, decided, dislike, of, him, he, declines, to, dance, with, elizabeth, the, second, eldest, bennet, daughter, as, she, is, not, handsome, enough, although, she, jokes, about, it, with, her, friend, elizabeth, is, deeply, offended, despite, this, first, impression, mr, darcy, secretly, begins, to, find, himself, drawn, to, elizabeth, as, they, continue, to,

social, connections, she, is, shocked, as, she, was, unaware, of, mr, darcy, s, interest, and, rejects, him, angrily, saying, that, he, is, the, last, person, she, would, ever, marry, and, that, she, could, never, love, a, man, who, caused, her, sister, such, unhappiness, she, further, accuses, him, of, treating, wickham, unjustly, mr, darcy, brags, about, his, success, in, separating, bingley, and, jane, and, sarcastically, dismisses, the, accusation, regarding, wickham, without, addressing, it, the, next, day, mr, darcy, gives, elizabeth, a, letter, explaining, that, wickham, the, son, of, his, late, father, s, steward, had, refused, the, living, his, father, had, arranged, for, him, and, was, instead, given, money, for, it, wickham, quickly, squandered, the, money, and, tried, to, elope, with, darcy, s, 15, year, old, sister, georgiana, for, her, considerable, dowry, mr, darcy, also, writes, that, he, separated, jane, and, bingley, because, he, believed, her, to, be, indifferent, to, bingley, and, because, of, the, lack, of, propriety, displayed, by, her, family, elizabeth, is, ashamed, by, her, family, s, behaviour, and, her, own, prejudice, against, mr, darcy, months, later, elizabeth, accompanies, the, gardiners, on, a, tour, of, derbyshire, they, visit, pemberley, darcy, s, estate, when, mr, darcy, returns, unexpectedly, he, is, exceedingly, gracious, with, elizabeth, and, the, gardiners, elizabeth, is, surprised, by, darcy, s, behaviour, and, grows, fond, of, him, even, coming, to, regret, rejecting, his, proposal, she, receives, news, that, her, sister, lydia, has, run, off, with, wickham, she, tells, mr, darcy, then, departs, in, haste, after, an, agonising, interim, wickham, agrees, to, marry, lydia, lydia, and, wickham, visit, the, bennet, family, at, longbourn, where, lydia, tells, elizabeth, that, mr, darcy, was, at, her, wedding, though, mr, darcy, had, sworn, everyone, involved, to, secrecy, mrs, gardiner, now, feels, obliged, to, inform, elizabeth, that, he, secured, the, match, at, great, expense, and, trouble, to, himself, mr, bingley, and, mr, darcy, return, to, netherfield, jane, accepts, mr, bingley, s, proposal, lady, catherine, having, heard, rumours, that, elizabeth, intends, to, marry, mr, darcy, visits, her, and, demands, she, promise, never, to, accept, mr, darcy, s, proposal, as, she, and, darcy, s, late, mother, had, already, planned, his, marriage, to, her, daughter, anne, elizabeth, refuses, and, asks, the, outraged, lady, catherine, to, leave, darcy, heartened, by, his, aunt, s, indignant, relaying, of, elizabeth, s, response, again, proposes, to, her, and, is, accepted, many, critics, take, the, title, as, the, start, when, analysing, the, themes, of, pride, and, prejudice, but, robert, fox, cautions, against, reading, too, much, into, the, title, which, was, initially, first, impressions, because, commercial, factors, may, have, played, a, role, in, its, selection, after, the, success, of, sense, and, sensibility, nothing, would, have, seemed, more, natural, than, to, bring, out, another, novel, of, the, same, author, using, again, the, formula, of, antithesis, and, alliteration, for, the, title, the, qualities, of, the, title, are, not, exclusively, assigned, to, one, or, the, other, of, the, protagonists, both, elizabeth, and, darcy, display, pride, and, prejudice, the, phrase, pride, and, prejudice, had, been, used, over, the, preceding, two, centuries, by, joseph, hall, jeremy, taylor, joseph, addison, and, samuel, johnson, austen, is, thought, to, have, taken, her, title, from, a, passage, in, fanny, burney, s, cecilia, 1782, a, novel, she, is, known, to, have, admired, the, whole, of, this, unfortunate, business, said, dr, lyster, has, been, the, result, of, pride, and, prejudice, if, to, pride, and, prejudice, you, owe, your, miseries, so, wonderfully, is, good, and, evil, balanced, that, to, pride, and, prejudice, you, will, also, owe, their, termination, capitalisation, as, in, the, original, a, theme, in, much, of, austen, s, work, is, the, importance, of, environment, and, upbringing, in, developing, young, people, s, character, and, morality, social, standing, and, wealth, are, not, necessarily, advantages, in, her, works, and, a, further, theme, common, to, austen, s, work, is, ineffectual, parents, in, pride, and, prejudice, the, failure, of, mr, and, mrs, bennet, as, parents, is, blamed, for, lydia, s, lack, of, moral, judgment, darcy, has, been, taught, to, be, principled, and, scrupulously, honourable, but, he, is, also, proud, and, overbearing, kitty, rescued, from, lydia, s, bad, influence, and, spending, more, time, with, her, older, sisters, after, they, marry, is, said, to, improve, greatly, in, their, superior, society, the, american, novelist, anna, quindlen, observed, in, an, introduction, to, an, edition, of, austen, s, novel, in, 1995, pride, and, prejudice, is, also, about, that, thing, that, all, great, novels, consider, the, search, for, self, and, it, is, the, first, great, novel, that, teaches, us, this, search, is, as, surely, undertaken, in, the, drawing, room, making, small, talk, as, in, the, pursuit, of, a, great, white, whale, or, the, public, punishment, of, adultery, the, opening, line, of, the, novel, announces, it, is, a, truth, universally, acknowledged, that, a, single, man, in, possession, of, a, good, fortune, must, be, in, want, of, a, wife, this, sets, marriage, as, a, motif, and, a, problem, in, the, novel, readers, are, poised, to, question, whether, or, not, these, single, men, need, a, wife, or, if, the, need, is, dictated, by, the, neighbourhood, families, and, their, daughters, who, require, a, good, fortune, marriage, is, a, complex, social, activity, that, takes, political, and, financial, economy, into, account, in, the, case, of, charlotte, lucas, the, seeming, success, of, her, marriage, lies, in, the, comfortable, financial, circumstances, of, their, household, while, the, relationship, between, mr, and, mrs, bennet, serves, to, illustrate, bad, marriages, based, on, an, initial, attraction, and, surface, over, substance, economic, and, psychological, the, bennets, marriage, is, an, example, that, the, youngest, bennet, lydia, re, enacts, with, wickham, and, the, results, are, far, from, felicitous, although, the, central, characters, elizabeth, and, darcy, begin, the, novel, as, hostile, acquaintances, and, unlikely, friends, they, eventually, work, toward, a, better, understanding, of, themselves, and, each, other, which, frees, them, to, truly, fall, in, love, this, does, not, eliminate, the, challenges, of, the, real, differences, in, their, technically, equivalent, social, status, as, gentry, and, their, female, relations, it, does, however, provide, them, with, a, better, understanding, of, each, other, s, point, of, view, from, the, different, ends, of, the, rather, wide, scale, of, differences, within, that, category, when, elizabeth, rejects, darcy, s, first, proposal, the, argument, of, marrying, for, love, is, introduced, elizabeth, only, accepts, darcy, s, proposal, when, she, is, certain, she, loves, him, and, her, feelings, are, reciprocated, austen, s, complex, sketching, of, different, marriages, ultimately, allows, readers, to, question, what, forms, of, alliance, are, desirable, especially, when, it, comes, to, privileging, economic, sexual, or, companionate, attraction, money, plays, a, fundamental, role, in, the, marriage, market, for, the, young, ladies, seeking, a, well, off, husband, and, for, men, who, wish, to, marry, a, woman, of, means, george, wickham, tries, to, elope, with, georgiana, darcy, and, colonel, fitzwilliam, states, that, he, will, marry, someone, with, wealth, marrying, a, woman, of, a, rich, family, also, ensured, a, linkage, to, a, higher, class, family, as, is, visible, in, the, desires, of, bingley, s, sisters, to, have, their, brother, married, to, georgiana, darcy, mrs, bennet, is, frequently, seen, encouraging, her, daughters, to, marry, a, wealthy, man, of, high, social, class, in, chapter, 1, when, mr, bingley, arrives, she, declares, i, am, thinking, of, his, marrying, one, of, them, inheritance, was, by, descent, but, could, be, further, restricted, by, entailment, which, in, the, case, of, the, longbourn, estate, restricted, inheritance, to, male, heirs, only, in, the, case, of, the, bennet, family, mr, collins, was, to, inherit, the, family, estate, upon, mr, bennet, s, death, in, the, absence, of, any, closer, male, heirs, and, his, proposal, to, elizabeth, would, have, ensured, her, security, but, she, refuses, his, offer, inheritance, laws, benefited, males, because, married, women, did, not, have, independent, legal, rights, until, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, for, the, upper, middle, and, aristocratic, classes, marriage, to, a, man, with, a, reliable, income, was, almost, the, only, route, to, security, for, the, woman, and, the, children, she, was, to, have, the, irony, of, the, opening, line, is, that, generally, within, this, society, it, would, be, a, woman, who, would, be, looking, for, a, wealthy, husband, to, have, a, prosperous, life, austen, might, be, known, now, for, her, romances, but, the, marriages, in, her, novels, engage, with, economics, and, class, distinction, pride, and, prejudice, is, hardly, the, exception, when, darcy, proposes, to, elizabeth, he, cites, their, economic, and, social, differences, as, an, obstacle, his, excessive, love, has, had, to, overcome, though, he, still, anxiously, harps, on, the, problems, it, poses, for, him, within, his, social, circle, his, aunt, lady, catherine, later, characterises, these, differences, in, particularly, harsh, terms, when, she, conveys, what, elizabeth, s, marriage, to, darcy, will, become, will, the, shades, of, pemberley, be, thus, polluted, although, elizabeth, responds, to, lady, catherine, s, accusations, that, hers, is, a, potentially, contaminating, economic, and, social, position, elizabeth, even, insists, she, and, darcy, as, gentleman, s, daughter, and, gentleman, are, equals, lady, catherine, refuses, to, accept, the, possibility, of, darcy, s, marriage, to, elizabeth, however, as, the, novel, closes, through, curiosity, to, see, how, his, wife, conducted, herself, lady, catherine, condescends, to, visit, them, at, pemberley, the, bingleys, present, a, particular, problem, for, navigating, class, though, caroline, bingley, and, mrs, hurst, behave, and, speak, of, others, as, if, they, have, always, belonged, in, the, upper, echelons, of, society, austen, makes, it, clear, that, the, bingley, fortunes, stem, from, trade, the, fact, that, bingley, rents, netherfield, hall, it, is, after, all, to, let, distinguishes, him, significantly, from, darcy, whose, estate, belonged, to, his, father, s, family, and, who, through, his, mother, is, the, grandson, and, nephew, of, an, earl, bingley, unlike, darcy, does, not, own, his, property, but, has, portable, and, growing, wealth, that, makes, him, a, good, catch, on, the, marriage, market, for, poorer, daughters, of, the, gentry, like, jane, bennet, or, of, ambitious, merchants, class, plays, a, central, role, in, the, evolution, of, the, characters, and, jane, austen, s, radical, approach, to, class, is, seen, as, the, plot, unfolds, an, undercurrent, of, the, old, anglo, norman, upper, class, is, hinted, at, in, the, story, as, suggested, by, the, names, of, fitzwilliam, darcy, and, his, aunt, lady, catherine, de, bourgh, fitzwilliam, d, arcy, de, bourgh, burke, and, even, bennet, are, traditional, norman, surnames, through, their, interactions, and, their, critiques, of, each, other, darcy, and, elizabeth, come, to, recognise, their, faults, and, work, to, correct, them, elizabeth, meditates, on, her, own, mistakes, thoroughly, in, chapter, 36, how, despicably, have, i, acted, she, cried, i, who, have, prided, myself, on, my, discernment, i, who, have, valued, myself, on, my, abilities, who, have, often, disdained, the, generous, candour, of, my, sister, and, gratified, my, vanity, in, useless, or, blameable, distrust, how, humiliating, is, this, discovery, yet, how, just, a, humiliation, had, i, been, in, love, i, could, not, have, been, more, wretchedly, blind, but, vanity, not, love, has, been, my, folly, pleased, with, the, preference, of, one, and, offended, by, the, neglect, of, the, other, on, the, very, beginning, of, our, acquaintance, i, have, courted, prepossession, and, ignorance, and, driven, reason, away, where, either, were, concerned, till, this, moment, i, never, knew, myself, other, characters, rarely, exhibit, this, depth, of, understanding, or, at, least, are, not, given, the, space, within, the, novel, for, this, sort, of, development, tanner, writes, that, mrs, bennet, in, particular, has, a, very, limited, view, of, the, requirements, of, that, performance, lacking, any, introspective, tendencies, she, is, incapable, of, appreciating, the, feelings, of, others, and, is, only, aware, of, material, objects, mrs, bennet, s, behaviour, reflects, the, society, in, which, she, lives, as, she, knows, that, her, daughters, will, not, succeed, if, they, do, not, get, married, the, business, of, her, life, was, to, get, her, daughters, married, its, solace, was, visiting, and, news, this, shows, that, mrs, bennet, is, only, aware, of, material, objects, and, not, of, her, feelings, and, emotions, a, notable, exception, is, charlotte, lucas, elizabeth, bennet, s, close, friend, and, confidant, she, accepts, mr, collins, s, proposal, of, marriage, once, lizzie, rejects, him, not, out, of, sentiment, but, acute, awareness, of, her, circumstances, as, one, of, a, large, family, charlotte, s, decision, is, reflective, of, her, prudent, nature, and, awareness, pride, and, prejudice, like, most, of, austen, s, works, employs, the, narrative, technique, of, free, indirect, speech, which, has, been, defined, as, the, free, representation, of, a, character, s, speech, by, which, one, means, not, words, actually, spoken, by, a, character, but, the, words, that, typify, the, character, s, thoughts, or, the, way, the, character, would, think, or, speak, if, she, thought, or, spoke, austen, creates, her, characters, with, fully, developed, personalities, and, unique, voices, though, darcy, and, elizabeth, are, very, alike, they, are, also, considerably, different, by, using, narrative, that, adopts, the, tone, and, vocabulary, of, a, particular, character, in, this, case, elizabeth, austen, invites, the, reader, to, follow, events, from, elizabeth, s, viewpoint, sharing, her, prejudices, and, misapprehensions, the, learning, curve, while, undergone, by, both, protagonists, is, disclosed, to, us, solely, through, elizabeth, s, point, of, view, and, her, free, indirect, speech, is, essential, for, it, is, through, it, that, we, remain, caught, if, not, stuck, within, elizabeth, s, misprisions, the, few, times, the, reader, is, allowed, to, gain, further, knowledge, of, another, character, s, feelings, is, through, the, letters, exchanged, in, this, novel, darcy, s, first, letter, to, elizabeth, is, an, example, of, this, as, through, his, letter, the, reader, and, elizabeth, are, both, given, knowledge, of, wickham, s, true, character, austen, is, known, to, use, irony, throughout, the, novel, especially, from, viewpoint, of, the, character, of, elizabeth, bennet, she, conveys, the, oppressive, rules, of, femininity, that, actually, dominate, her, life, and, work, and, are, covered, by, her, beautifully, carved, trojan, horse, of, ironic, distance, beginning, with, a, historical, investigation, of, the, development, of, a, particular, literary, form, and, then, transitioning, into, empirical, verifications, it, reveals, free, indirect, discourse, as, a, tool, that, emerged, over, time, as, practical, means, for, addressing, the, physical, distinctness, of, minds, seen, in, this, way, free, indirect, discourse, is, a, distinctly, literary, response, to, an, environmental, concern, providing, a, scientific, justification, that, does, not, reduce, literature, to, a, mechanical, extension, of, biology, but, takes, its, value, to, be, its, own, original, form, austen, began, writing, the, novel, after, staying, at, goodnestone, park, in, kent, with, her, brother, edward, and, his, wife, in, 1796, it, was, originally, titled, first, impressions, and, was, written, between, october, 1796, and, august, 1797, on, 1, november, 1797, austen, s, father, sent, a, letter, to, london, bookseller, thomas, cadell, to, ask, if, he, had, any, interest, in, seeing, the, manuscript, but, the, offer, was, declined, by, return, post, the, militia, were, mobilised, after, the, french, declaration, of, war, on, britain, in, february, 1793, and, there, was, initially, a, lack, of, barracks, for, all, the, militia, regiments, requiring, the, militia, to, set, up, huge, camps, in, the, countryside, which, the, novel, refers, to, several, times, 57, the, brighton, camp, for, which, the, militia, regiment, leaves, in, may, after, spending, the, winter, in, meryton, was, opened, in, august, 1793, and, the, barracks, for, all, the, regiments, of, the, militia, were, completed, by, 1796, placing, the, events, of, the, novel, between, 1793, and, 1795, 56, 57, austen, made, significant, revisions, to, the, manuscript, for, first, impressions, between, 1811, and, 1812, as, nothing, remains, of, the, original, manuscript, study, of, the, first, drafts, of, the, novel, is, reduced, to, conjecture, from, the, large, number, of, letters, in, the, final, novel, it, is, assumed, that, first, impressions, was, an, epistolary, novel, she, later, renamed, the, story, pride, and, prejudice, around, 1811, 1812, when, she, sold, the, rights, to, publish, the, manuscript, to, thomas, egerton, for, 110, equivalent, to, 9, 300, in, 2023, in, renaming, the, novel, austen, probably, had, in, mind, the, sufferings, and, oppositions, summarised, in, the, final, chapter, of, fanny, burney, s, cecilia, called, pride, and, prejudice, where, the, phrase, appears, three, times, in, block, capitals, it, is, possible, that, the, novel, s, original, title, was, altered, to, avoid, confusion, with, other, works, in, the, years, between, the, completion, of, first, impressions, and, its, revision, into, pride, and, prejudice, two, other, works, had, been, published, under, that, name, a, novel, by, margaret, holford, and, a, comedy, by, horace, smith, austen, sold, the, copyright, for, the, novel, to, thomas, egerton, from, the, military, library, whitehall, in, exchange, for, 110, austen, had, asked, for, 150, this, proved, a, costly, decision, austen, had, published, sense, and, sensibility, on, a, commission, basis, whereby, she, indemnified, the, publisher, against, any, losses, and, received, any, profits, less, costs, and, the, publisher, s, commission, unaware, that, sense, and, sensibility, would, sell, out, its, edition, making, her, 140, she, passed, the, copyright, to, egerton, for, a, one, off, payment, meaning, that, all, the, risk, and, all, the, profits, would, be, his, jan, fergus, has, calculated, that, egerton, subsequently, made, around, 450, from, just, the, first, two, editions, of, the, book, egerton, published, the, first, edition, of, pride, and, prejudice, in, three, hardcover, volumes, on, 28, january, 1813, it, was, advertised, in, the, morning, chronicle, priced, at, 18s, favourable, reviews, saw, this, edition, sold, out, with, a, second, edition, published, in, october, that, year, a, third, edition, was, published, in, 1817, foreign, language, translations, first, appeared, in, 1813, in, french, subsequent, translations, were, published, in, german, danish, and, swedish, pride, and, prejudice, was, first, published, in, the, united, states, in, august, 1832, as, elizabeth, bennet, or, pride, and, prejudice, the, novel, was, also, included, in, richard, bentley, s, standard, novel, series, in, 1833, r, w, chapman, s, scholarly, edition, of, pride, and, prejudice, first, published, in, 1923, has, become, the, standard, edition, on, which, many, modern, published, versions, of, the, novel, are, based, the, novel, was, originally, published, anonymously, as, were, all, of, austen, s, novels, however, whereas, her, first, published, novel, sense, and, sensibility, was, presented, as, being, written, by, a, lady, pride, and, prejudice, was, attributed, to, the, author, of, sense, and, sensibility, this, began,
