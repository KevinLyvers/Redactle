come, glam, rock, in, the, uk, and, the, new, york, dolls, from, new, york, have, also, been, cited, as, key, influences, between, 1974, and, 1976, when, the, genre, that, became, known, as, punk, was, developing, prominent, acts, included, television, patti, smith, and, the, ramones, in, new, york, city, the, saints, in, brisbane, the, sex, pistols, the, clash, and, the, damned, in, london, and, the, buzzcocks, in, manchester, by, late, 1976, punk, had, become, a, major, cultural, phenomenon, in, the, uk, it, gave, rise, to, a, punk, subculture, that, expressed, youthful, rebellion,

s, m, clothes, in, 1977, the, influence, of, the, music, and, subculture, spread, worldwide, it, took, root, in, a, wide, range, of, local, scenes, that, often, rejected, affiliation, with, the, mainstream, in, the, late, 1970s, punk, experienced, a, second, wave, when, new, acts, that, had, not, been, active, during, its, formative, years, adopted, the, style, by, the, early, 1980s, faster, and, more, aggressive, subgenres, such, as, hardcore, punk, e, g, minor, threat, oi, e, g, sham, 69, street, punk, e, g, the, exploited, and, anarcho, punk, e, g, crass, became, some, of, the, predominant, modes, of, punk, rock, while, bands, more, similar, in, form, to, the, first, wave, e, g, x, the, adicts, also, flourished, many, musicians, who, identified, with, punk, or, were, inspired, by, it, went, on, to, pursue, other, musical, directions, giving, rise, to, movements, such, as, post, punk, new, wave, thrash, metal, and, alternative, rock, following, alternative, rock, s, mainstream, breakthrough, in, the, 1990s, with, nirvana, punk, rock, saw, renewed, major, label, interest, and, mainstream, appeal, exemplified, by, the, rise, of, the, california, bands, green,

drummer, tommy, ramone, in, its, initial, form, a, lot, of, 1960s, stuff, was, innovative, and, exciting, unfortunately, what, happens, is, that, people, who, could, not, hold, a, candle, to, the, likes, of, hendrix, started, noodling, away, soon, you, had, endless, solos, that, went, nowhere, by, 1973, i, knew, that, what, was, needed, was, some, pure, stripped, down, no, bullshit, rock, n, roll, john, holmstrom, founding, editor, of, punk, magazine, recalls, feeling, punk, rock, had, to, come, along, because, the, rock, scene, had, become, so, tame, that, like, billy, joel, and, simon, and, garfunkel, were, being, called, rock, and, roll, when, to, me, and, other, fans, rock, and, roll, meant, this, wild, and, rebellious, music, according, to, robert, christgau, punk, scornfully, rejected, the, political, idealism, and, californian, flower, power, silliness, of, hippie, myth, hippies, were, rainbow, extremists, punks, are, romantics, of, black, and, white, hippies, forced,

contributed, to, the, emergence, of, punk, rock, by, developing, a, network, of, small, venues, such, as, pubs, where, non, mainstream, bands, could, play, pub, rock, also, introduced, the, idea, of, independent, record, labels, such, as, stiff, records, which, put, out, basic, low, cost, records, pub, rock, bands, organized, their, own, small, venue, tours, and, put, out, small, pressings, of, their, records, in, the, early, days, of, punk, rock, this, diy, ethic, stood, in, marked, contrast, to, what, those, in, the, scene, regarded, as, the, ostentatious, musical, effects, and, technological, demands, of, many, mainstream, rock, bands, musical, virtuosity, was, often, looked, on, with, suspicion, according, to, holmstrom, punk, rock, was, rock, and, roll, by, people, who, didn, t, have, very, many, skills, as, musicians, but, still, felt, the, need, to, express, themselves, through, music, in, december, 1976, the, english, fanzine, sideburns, published, a, now, famous,

britain, became, a, musical, and, a, cultural, year, zero, as, nostalgia, was, discarded, many, in, the, scene, adopted, a, nihilistic, attitude, summed, up, by, the, sex, pistols, slogan, no, future, in, the, later, words, of, one, observer, amid, the, unemployment, and, social, unrest, in, 1977, punk, s, nihilistic, swagger, was, the, most, thrilling, thing, in, england, while, self, imposed, alienation, was, common, among, drunk, punks, and, gutter, punks, there, was, always, a, tension, between, their, nihilistic, outlook, and, the, radical, leftist, utopianism, of, bands, such, as, crass, who, found, positive, liberating, meaning, in, the, movement, as, a, clash, associate, describes, singer, joe, strummer, s, outlook, punk, rock, is, meant, to, be, our, freedom, we, re, meant, to, be, able, to, do, what, we, want, to, do, authenticity, has, always, been, important, in, the, punk, subculture, the, pejorative, term, poseur, is, applied, to, those, who, adopt, its, stylistic, attributes, but, do, not, actually, share, or, understand, its, underlying, values, and, philosophy, scholar, daniel, s, traber, argues, that, attaining, authenticity, in, the, punk, identity, can, be, difficult, as, the, punk, scene, matured, he, observes, eventually, everyone, got, called, a, poseur, the, early, punk, bands, emulated, the, minimal, musical, arrangements, of, 1960s, garage, rock, typical, punk, rock, instrumentation, is, stripped, down, to, one, or, two, guitars, bass, drums, and, vocals, songs, tend, to, be, shorter, than, those, of, other, rock, genres, and, played, at, fast, tempos, most, early, punk, rock, songs, retained, a, traditional, rock, n, roll, verse, chorus, form, and, 4, 4, time, signature, however, later, bands, often, broke, from, this, format, the, vocals, are, sometimes, nasal, and, the, lyrics, often, shouted, in, an, arrogant, snarl, rather, than, conventionally, sung, complicated, guitar, solos, were, considered, self, indulgent, although, basic, guitar, breaks, were, common, guitar, parts, tend, to, include, highly, distorted, power, chords, or, barre, chords, creating, a, characteristic, sound, described, by, christgau, as, a, buzzsaw, drone, some, punk, rock, bands, take, a, surf, rock, approach, with, a, lighter, twangier, guitar, tone, others, such, as, robert, quine, lead, guitarist, of, the, voidoids, have, employed, a, wild, gonzo, attack, a, style, that, stretches, back, through, the, velvet, underground, to, the, 1950s, recordings, of, ike, turner, bass, guitar, lines, are, often, uncomplicated, the, quintessential, approach, is, a, relentless, repetitive, forced, rhythm, although, some, punk, rock, bass, players, such, as, mike, watt, of, the, minutemen, and, firehose, emphasize, more, technical, bass, lines, bassists, often, use, a, pick, due, to, the, rapid, succession, of, notes, making, fingerpicking, impractical, drums, typically, sound, heavy, and, dry, and, often, have, a, minimal, set,

laid, down, on, home, tape, recorders, or, four, track, portastudios, punk, rock, lyrics, are, typically, blunt, and, confrontational, compared, to, the, lyrics, of, other, popular, music, genres, they, often, focus, on, social, and, political, issues, trend, setting, songs, such, as, the, clash, s, career, opportunities, and, chelsea, s, right, to, work, deal, with, unemployment, and, the, grim, realities, of, urban, life, especially, in, early, british, punk, a, central, goal, was, to, outrage, and, shock, the, mainstream, the, sex, pistols, anarchy, in, the, u, k, and, god, save, the,

theme, the, controversial, content, of, punk, lyrics, has, frequently, led, to, certain, punk, records, being, banned, by, radio, stations, and, refused, shelf, space, in, major, chain, stores, christgau, said, that, punk, is, so, tied, up, with, the, disillusions, of, growing, up, that, punks, do, often, age, poorly, the, classic, punk, rock, look, among, male, american, musicians, harkens, back, to, the, t, shirt, motorcycle, jacket, and, jeans, ensemble, favored, by, american, greasers, of, the, 1950s, associated, with, the, rockabilly, scene, and, by, british, rockers, of, the, 1960s, in, addition, to, the, t, shirt, and, leather, jackets, they, wore, ripped, jeans, and, boots, typically, doc, martens, the, punk, look, was, inspired, to, shock, people, richard, hell, s, more, androgynous, ragamuffin, look, and, reputed, invention, of, the, safety, pin, aesthetic, was, a, major, influence, on, sex, pistols, impresario, malcolm, mclaren, and, in, turn, british, punk, style,

following, punk, could, afford, to, buy, mclaren, and, westwood, s, designs, so, famously, worn, by, the, pistols, so, they, made, their, own, diversifying, the, look, with, various, different,
