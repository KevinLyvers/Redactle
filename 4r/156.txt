wrote, to, his, son, august, that, coleridge, was, translating, faust, however, this, attribution, is, controversial, roger, paulin, william, st, clair, and, elinor, shaffer, provide, a, lengthy, rebuttal, to, burwick, and, mckusick, offering, evidence, including, coleridge, s, repeated, denials, that, he, had, ever, translated, faustus, and, arguing, that, goethe, s, letter, to, his, son, was, based, on, misinformation, from, a, third, party, coleridge, s, fellow, romantic, percy, bysshe, shelley, produced, admired, fragments, of, a, translation, first, publishing, part, one, scene,

translator, clearly, distorts, goethe, s, ideas, in, order, to, defend, the, reactionary, theory, of, pure, art, he, introduces, an, aesthetic, and, individualist, flavor, into, the, text, attributes, a, reactionary, idea, to, goethe, distorts, the, social, and, philosophical, meaning, in, response, pasternak, wrote, to, ariadna, fron, the, exiled, daughter, of, marina, tsvetaeva, there, was, some, alarm, when, my, faust, was, torn, to, pieces, in, novy, mir, on, the, basis, that, supposedly, the, gods, angels, witches, spirits, the, madness, of, poor, gretchen, and, everything, irrational, was, rendered, too, well, whereas, goethe, s, progressive, ideas, which, ones, were, left, in, the, shade, and, unattended
