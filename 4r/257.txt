the, history, of, the, decline, and, fall, of, the, roman, empire, sometimes, shortened, to, decline, and, fall, of, the, roman, empire, is, a, six, volume, work, by, the, english, historian, edward, gibbon, the, six, volumes, cover, from, 98, to, 1590, the, peak, of, the, roman, empire, the, history, of, early, christianity, and, its, emergence, as, the, roman, state, religion, the, fall, of, the, western, roman, empire, the, rise, of, genghis, khan, and, tamerlane, and, the, fall, of, byzantium, as, well, as, discussions, on, the, ruins, of, ancient, rome, volume, i, was, published, in, 1776, and, went, through, six, printings, volumes, ii, and, iii, were, published, in, 1781, volumes, iv, v, and, vi, in, 1788, 1789, the, original, volumes, were, published, in, quarto, sections, a, common, publishing, practice, of, the, time, gibbon, s, initial, plan, was, to, write, a, history, of, the, decline, and, fall, of, the, city, of, rome, and, only, later, expanded, his, scope, to, the, whole, roman, empire, although, he, published, other, books, gibbon, devoted, much, of, his, life, to, this, one, work, 1772, 1789, his, autobiography, memoirs, of, my, life, and, writings, is, devoted, largely, to, his, reflections, on, how, the, book, virtually, became, his, life, he, compared, the, publication, of, each, succeeding, volume, to, a, newborn, child, as, for, sources, more, recent, than, the, ancients, gibbon, drew, on, montesquieu, s, considerations, on, the, causes, of, the, greatness, of, the, romans, and, their, decline, 1734, voltaire, s, essay, on, universal, history, 1756, and, bossuet, s, discourse, on, universal, history, 1681, gibbon, offers, an, explanation, for, the, fall, of, the, roman, empire, a, task, made, difficult, by, a, lack, of, comprehensive, written, sources, according, to, gibbon, the, roman, empire, succumbed, to, barbarian, invasions, in, large, part, due, to, the, gradual, loss, of, civic, virtue, among, its, citizens, he, began, an, ongoing, controversy, about, the, role, of, christianity, but, he, gave, great, weight, to, other, causes, of, internal, decline, and, to, attacks, from, outside, the, empire, like, other, enlightenment, thinkers, and, british, citizens, of, the, age, steeped, in, institutional, anti, catholicism, gibbon, held, in, contempt, the, middle, ages, as, a, priest, ridden, superstitious, dark, age, it, was, not, until, his, own, era, the, age, of, reason, with, its, emphasis, on, rational, thought, he, believed, that, human, history, could, resume, its, progress, gibbon, s, tone, was, detached, dispassionate, and, yet, critical, he, was, noted, as, occasionally, lapsing, into, moralisation, and, aphorism, gibbon, continued, to, revise, and, change, his, work, even, after, publication, the, complexities, of, the, problem, are, addressed, in, womersley, s, introduction, and, appendices, to, his, complete, edition, numerous, tracts, were, published, criticising, his, work, in, response, gibbon, defended, his, work, with, the, 1779, publication, of, a, vindication, of, the, decline, and, fall, of, the, roman, empire, edward, gibbon, s, central, thesis, in, his, explanation, of, how, the, roman, empire, fell, that, it, was, due, to, embracing, christianity, is, not, widely, accepted, by, scholars, today, gibbon, argued, that, with, the, empire, s, new, christian, character, large, sums, of, wealth, that, would, have, otherwise, been, used, in, secular, affairs, in, promoting, the, state, were, transferred, to, promoting, the, activities, of, the, church, however, the, pre, christian, empire, also, spent, large, financial, sums, on, religion, and, it, is, unclear, whether, or, not, the, change, of, religion, increased, the, amount, of, resources, the, empire, spent, on, it, gibbon, further, argued, that, new, attitudes, in, christianity, caused, many, christians, of, wealth, to, renounce, their, lifestyles, and, enter, a, monastic, lifestyle, and, so, stop, participating, in, the, support, of, the, empire, however, while, many, christians, of, wealth, did, become, monastics, this, paled, in, comparison, to, the, participants, in, the, imperial, bureaucracy, although, gibbon, further, pointed, out, that, the, importance, christianity, placed, on, peace, caused, a, decline, in, the, number, of, people, serving, the, military, the, decline, was, so, small, as, to, be, negligible, for, the, army, s, effectiveness, john, julius, norwich, despite, his, admiration, for, gibbon, s, furthering, of, historical, methodology, considered, his, hostile, views, on, the, byzantine, empire, flawed, and, blamed, him, somewhat, for, the, lack, of, interest, shown, in, the, subject, throughout, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, gibbon, prefaced, subsequent, editions, to, note, that, discussion, of, byzantium, was, not, his, interest, in, writing, the, book, however, the, yugoslavian, historian, george, ostrogorsky, wrote, gibbon, and, lebeau, were, genuine, historians, and, gibbon, a, very, great, one, and, their, works, in, spite, of, factual, inadequacy, rank, high, for, their, presentation, of, their, material, gibbon, challenged, church, history, by, estimating, far, smaller, numbers, of, christian, martyrs, than, had, been, traditionally, accepted, the, church, s, version, of, its, early, history, had, rarely, been, questioned, before, gibbon, however, said, that, modern, church, writings, were, secondary, sources, and, he, shunned, them, in, favour, of, primary, sources, historian, s, p, foster, says, that, gibbon, blamed, the, otherworldly, preoccupations, of, christianity, for, the, decline, of, the, roman, empire, heaped, scorn, and, abuse, on, the, church, and, sneered, at, the, entirety, of, monasticism, as, a, dreary, superstition, ridden, enterprise, gibbon, s, work, was, originally, published, in, sections, as, was, common, for, large, works, at, the, time, the, first, two, volumes, were, well, received, and, widely, praised, but, with, the, publication, of, volume, 3, gibbon, was, attacked, by, some, as, a, paganist, because, he, argued, that, christianity, or, at, least, the, abuse, of, it, by, some, of, the, clergy, and, its, followers, had, hastened, the, fall, of, the, roman, empire, voltaire, was, deemed, to, have, influenced, gibbon, s, claim, that, christianity, was, a, contributor, to, the, fall, of, the, roman, empire, gibbon, has, been, criticized, for, his, portrayal, of, paganism, as, tolerant, and, christianity, as, intolerant, many, writers, have, used, variations, on, the, series, title, including, using, rise, and, fall, in, place, of, decline, and, fall, especially, when, dealing, with, a, large, polity, that, has, imperial, characteristics, notable, examples, include, jefferson, davis, the, rise, and, fall, of, the, confederate, government, william, shirer, s, the, rise, and, fall, of, the, third, reich, and, david, bowie, s, the, rise, and, fall, of, ziggy, stardust, and, the, spiders, from, mars, the, title, and, author, have, also, been, referenced, in, poems, such, as, no, l, coward, s, i, went, to, a, marvellous, party, if, you, have, any, mind, at, all, gibbon, s, divine, decline, and, fall, seems, pretty, flimsy, no, more, than, a, whimsy, and, isaac, asimov, s, the, foundation, of, s, f, success, in, which, asimov, admits, his, foundation, series, about, the, fall, and, rebuilding, of, a, galactic, empire, was, written, with, a, tiny, bit, of, cribbin, from, the, works, of, edward, gibbon, piers, brendon, who, wrote, the, decline, and, fall, of, the, british, empire, 1781, 1997, claimed, that, gibbon, s, work, became, the, essential, guide, for, britons, anxious, to, plot,
