symbolism, was, a, late, 19th, century, art, movement, of, french, and, belgian, origin, in, poetry, and, other, arts, seeking, to, represent, absolute, truths, symbolically, through, language, and, metaphorical, images, mainly, as, a, reaction, against, naturalism, and, realism, in, literature, the, style, originates, with, the, 1857, publication, of, charles, baudelaire, s, les, fleurs, du, mal, the, works, of, edgar, allan, poe, which, baudelaire, admired, greatly, and, translated, into, french, were, a, significant, influence, and, the, source, of, many, stock, tropes, and, images, the, aesthetic, was, developed, by, st, phane, mallarm, and, paul, verlaine, during, the, 1860s, and, 1870s, in, the, 1880s, the, aesthetic, was, articulated, by, a, series, of, manifestos, and, attracted, a, generation, of, writers, the, term, symbolist, was, first, applied, by, the, critic, jean, mor, as, who, invented, the, term, to, distinguish, the, symbolists, from, the, related, decadents, of, literature, and, art, the, term, symbolism, is, derived, from, the, word, symbol, which, derives, from, the, latin, symbolum, a, symbol, of, faith, and, symbolus, a, sign, of, recognition, in, turn, from, classical, greek, symbolon, an, object, cut, in, half, constituting, a, sign, of, recognition, when, the, carriers, were, able, to, reassemble, the, two, halves, in, ancient, greece, the, symbolon, was, a, shard, of, pottery, which, was, inscribed, and, then, broken, into, two, pieces, which, were, given, to, the, ambassadors, from, two, allied, city, states, as, a, record, of, the, alliance, symbolism, was, largely, a, reaction, against, naturalism, and, realism, anti, idealistic, styles, which, were, attempts, to, represent, reality, in, its, gritty, particularity, and, to, elevate, the, humble, and, the, ordinary, over, the, ideal, symbolism, was, a, reaction, in, favour, of, spirituality, imagination, and, dreams, some, writers, such, as, joris, karl, huysmans, began, as, naturalists, before, becoming, symbolists, for, huysmans, this, change, represented, his, increasing, interest, in, religion, and, spirituality, certain, of, the, characteristic, subjects, of, the, decadents, represent, naturalist, interest, in, sexuality, and, taboo, topics, but, in, their, case, this, was, mixed, with, byronic, romanticism, and, the, world, weariness, characteristic, of, the, fin, de, si, cle, period, the, symbolist, poets, have, a, more, complex, relationship, with, parnassianism, a, french, literary, style, that, immediately, preceded, it, while, being, influenced, by, hermeticism, allowing, freer, versification, and, rejecting, parnassian, clarity, and, objectivity, it, retained, parnassianism, s, love, of, word, play, and, concern, for, the, musical, qualities, of, verse, the, symbolists, continued, to, admire, th, ophile, gautier, s, motto, of, art, for, art, s, sake, and, retained, and, modified, parnassianism, s, mood, of, ironic, detachment, many, symbolist, poets, including, st, phane, mallarm, and, paul, verlaine, published, early, works, in, le, parnasse, contemporain, the, poetry, anthologies, that, gave, parnassianism, its, name, but, arthur, rimbaud, publicly, mocked, prominent, parnassians, and, published, scatological, parodies, of, some, of, their, main, authors, including, fran, ois, copp, e, misattributed, to, copp, e, himself, in, l, album, zutique, one, of, symbolism, s, most, colourful, promoters, in, paris, was, art, and, literary, critic, and, occultist, jos, phin, p, ladan, who, established, the, salon, de, la, rose, croix, the, salon, hosted, a, series, of, six, presentations, of, avant, garde, art, writing, and, music, during, the, 1890s, to, give, a, presentation, space, for, artists, embracing, spiritualism, mysticism, and, idealism, in, their, work, a, number, of, symbolists, were, associated, with, the, salon, jean, mor, as, published, the, symbolist, manifesto, le, symbolisme, in, le, figaro, on, 18, september, 1886, see, 1886, in, poetry, the, symbolist, manifesto, names, charles, baudelaire, st, phane, mallarm, and, paul, verlaine, as, the, three, leading, poets, of, the, movement, mor, as, announced, that, symbolism, was, hostile, to, plain, meanings, declamations, false, sentimentality, and, matter, of, fact, description, and, that, its, goal, instead, was, to, clothe, the, ideal, in, a, perceptible, form, whose, goal, was, not, in, itself, but, whose, sole, purpose, was, to, express, the, ideal, in, a, nutshell, as, mallarm, writes, in, a, letter, to, his, friend, henri, cazalis, to, depict, not, the, thing, but, the, effect, it, produces, in, 1891, mallarm, defined, symbolism, as, follows, to, name, an, object, is, to, suppress, three, quarters, of, the, delight, of, the, poem, which, consists, in, the, pleasure, of, guessing, little, by, little, to, suggest, is, that, is, the, dream, it, is, the, perfect, use, of, this, mystery, that, constitutes, the, symbol, to, evoke, an, object, gradually, in, order, to, reveal, a, state, of, the, soul, or, inversely, to, choose, an, object, and, from, it, identify, a, state, of, the, soul, by, a, series, of, deciphering, operations, there, must, always, be, enigma, in, poetry, while, describing, the, pre, world, war, i, friendship, which, defied, the, pervasive, anti, german, sentiment, and, revanchism, of, the, belle, poque, between, french, symbolists, paul, verlaine, and, st, phane, mallarm, and, young, and, aspiring, german, symbolist, poet, stefan, george, michael, and, erika, metzger, have, written, for, the, symbolists, the, pursuit, of, art, for, art, s, sake, was, a, highly, serious, nearly, a, sacred, function, since, beauty, in, and, of, itself, stood, for, a, higher, meaning, beyond, itself, in, their, ultimate, higher, striving, the, french, symbolists, are, not, far, from, the, platonic, ideals, of, the, good, the, true, and, the, beautiful, and, this, idealistic, aspect, was, undoubtedly, what, appealed, to, george, far, more, than, the, estheticism, the, bohemianism, and, the, apparent, nihilism, so, often, superficially, associated, with, this, group, the, symbolist, poets, wished, to, liberate, techniques, of, versification, in, order, to, allow, greater, room, for, fluidity, and, as, such, were, sympathetic, with, the, trend, toward, free, verse, as, evident, in, the, poems, of, gustave, kahn, and, ezra, pound, symbolist, poems, were, attempts, to, evoke, rather, than, primarily, to, describe, symbolic, imagery, was, used, to, signify, the, state, of, the, poet, s, soul, t, s, eliot, was, influenced, by, the, poets, jules, laforgue, paul, val, ry, and, arthur, rimbaud, who, used, the, techniques, of, the, symbolist, school, though, it, has, also, been, said, that, imagism, was, the, style, to, which, both, pound, and, eliot, subscribed, see, pound, s, des, imagistes, synesthesia, was, a, prized, experience, poets, sought, to, identify, and, confound, the, separate, senses, of, scent, sound, and, colour, in, baudelaire, s, poem, correspondences, which, mentions, for, ts, de, symboles, forests, of, symbols, and, is, considered, the, touchstone, of, french, symbolism, and, rimbaud, s, poem, voyelles, both, poets, seek, to, identify, one, sense, experience, with, another, the, earlier, romanticism, of, poetry, used, symbols, but, these, symbols, were, unique, and, privileged, objects, the, symbolists, were, more, extreme, investing, all, things, even, vowels, and, perfumes, with, potential, symbolic, value, the, physical, universe, then, is, a, kind, of, language, that, invites, a, privileged, spectator, to, decipher, it, although, this, does, not, yield, a, single, message, so, much, as, a, superior, network, of, associations, symbolist, symbols, are, not, allegories, intended, to, represent, they, are, instead, intended, to, evoke, particular, states, of, mind, the, nominal, subject, of, mallarm, s, le, cygne, the, swan, is, of, a, swan, trapped, in, a, frozen, lake, significantly, in, french, cygne, is, a, homophone, of, signe, a, sign, the, overall, effect, is, of, overwhelming, whiteness, and, the, presentation, of, the, narrative, elements, of, the, description, is, quite, indirect, of, the, several, attempts, at, defining, the, essence, of, symbolism, perhaps, none, was, more, influential, than, paul, verlaine, s, 1884, publication, of, a, series, of, essays, on, tristan, corbi, re, arthur, rimbaud, st, phane, mallarm, marceline, desbordes, valmore, g, rard, de, nerval, and, pauvre, lelian, poor, lelian, an, anagram, of, paul, verlaine, s, own, name, each, of, whom, verlaine, numbered, among, the, po, tes, maudits, accursed, poets, verlaine, argued, that, in, their, individual, and, very, different, ways, each, of, these, hitherto, neglected, poets, found, genius, a, curse, it, isolated, them, from, their, contemporaries, and, as, a, result, these, poets, were, not, at, all, concerned, to, avoid, hermeticism, and, idiosyncratic, writing, styles, they, were, also, portrayed, as, at, odds, with, society, having, tragic, lives, and, often, given, to, self, destructive, tendencies, these, traits, were, not, hindrances, but, consequences, of, their, literary, gifts, verlaine, s, concept, of, the, po, te, maudit, in, turn, borrows, from, baudelaire, who, opened, his, collection, les, fleurs, du, mal, with, the, poem, b, n, diction, which, describes, a, poet, whose, internal, serenity, remains, undisturbed, by, the, contempt, of, the, people, surrounding, him, in, this, conception, of, genius, and, the, role, of, the, poet, verlaine, referred, indirectly, to, the, aesthetics, of, arthur, schopenhauer, the, philosopher, of, pessimism, who, maintained, that, the, purpose, of, art, was, to, provide, a, temporary, refuge, from, the, world, of, strife, of, the, will, schopenhauer, s, aesthetics, represented, shared, concerns, with, the, symbolist, programme, they, both, tended, to, consider, art, as, a, contemplative, refuge, from, the, world, of, strife, and, will, as, a, result, of, this, desire, for, an, artistic, refuge, the, symbolists, used, characteristic, themes, of, mysticism, and, otherworldliness, a, keen, sense, of, mortality, and, a, sense, of, the, malign, power, of, sexuality, which, albert, samain, termed, a, fruit, of, death, upon, the, tree, of, life, mallarm, s, poem, les, fen, tres, expresses, all, of, these, themes, clearly, a, dying, man, in, a, hospital, bed, seeking, escape, from, the, pain, and, dreariness, of, his, physical, surroundings, turns, toward, his, window, but, then, turns, away, in, disgust, from, and, in, contrast, he, turns, his, back, on, life, tourne, l, paule, la, vie, and, he, exclaims, the, symbolist, style, has, frequently, been, confused, with, the, decadent, movement, the, name, derived, from, french, literary, critics, in, the, 1880s, suggesting, the, writers, were, self, indulgent, and, obsessed, with, taboo, subjects, while, a, few, writers, embraced, the, term, most, avoided, it, jean, mor, as, manifesto, was, largely, a, response, to, this, polemic, by, the, late, 1880s, the, terms, symbolism, and, decadence, were, understood, to, be, almost, synonymous, though, the, aesthetics, of, the, styles, can, be, considered, similar, in, some, ways, the, two, remain, distinct, the, symbolists, were, those, artists, who, emphasized, dreams, and, ideals, the, decadents, cultivated, pr, cieux, ornamented, or, hermetic, styles, and, morbid, subject, matters, the, subject, of, the, decadence, of, the, roman, empire, was, a, frequent, source, of, literary, images, and, appears, in, the, works, of, many, poets, of, the, period, regardless, of, which, name, they, chose, for, their, style, as, in, verlaine, s, langueur, a, number, of, important, literary, publications, were, founded, by, symbolists, or, became, associated, with, the, style, the, first, was, la, vogue, initiated, in, april, 1886, in, october, of, that, same, year, jean, mor, as, gustave, kahn, and, paul, adam, began, the, periodical, le, symboliste, one, of, the, most, important, symbolist, journals, was, mercure, de, france, edited, by, alfred, vallette, which, succeeded, la, pl, iade, founded, in, 1890, this, periodical, endured, until, 1965, pierre, lou, s, initiated, la,

literature, is, distinct, from, symbolism, in, art, although, the, two, were, similar, in, many, aspects, in, painting, symbolism, can, be, seen, as, a, revival, of, some, mystical, tendencies, in, the, romantic, tradition, and, was, close, to, the, self, consciously, morbid, and, private, decadent, movement, there, were, several, rather, dissimilar, groups, of, symbolist, painters, and, visual, artists, which, included, paul, gauguin, gustave, moreau, gustav, klimt, mikalojus, konstantinas, iurlionis, jacek, malczewski, odilon, redon, pierre, puvis, de, chavannes, henri, fantin, latour,
