der, ring, des, nibelungen, the, ring, of, the, nibelung, wwv, 86, is, a, cycle, of, four, german, language, epic, music, dramas, composed, by, richard, wagner, the, works, are, based, loosely, on, characters, from, germanic, heroic, legend, namely, norse, legendary, sagas, and, the, nibelungenlied, the, composer, termed, the, cycle, a, b, hnenfestspiel, stage, festival, play, structured, in, three, days, preceded, by, a, vorabend, preliminary, evening, it, is, often, referred, to, as, the, ring, cycle, wagner, s, ring, or, simply, the, ring, wagner, wrote, the, libretto, and, music, over, the, course, of, about, twenty, six, years, from, 1848, to, 1874, the, four, parts, that, constitute, the, ring, cycle, are, in, sequence, individual, works, of, the, sequence, are, often, performed, separately, and, indeed, the, operas, contain, dialogues, that, mention, events, in, the, previous, operas, so, that, a, viewer, could, watch, any, of, them, without, having, watched, the, previous, parts, and, still, understand, the, plot, however, wagner, intended, them, to, be, performed, in, series, the, first, performance, as, a, cycle, opened, the, first, bayreuth, festival, in, 1876, beginning, with, das, rheingold, on, 13, august, and, ending, with, g, tterd, mmerung, on, 17, august, opera, stage, director, anthony, freud, stated, that, der, ring, des, nibelungen, marks, the, high, water, mark, of, our, art, form, the, most, massive, challenge, any, opera, company, can, undertake, wagner, s, title, is, most, literally, rendered, in, english, as, the, ring, of, the, nibelung, the, nibelung, of, the, title, is, the, dwarf, alberich, and, the, ring, in, question, is, the, one, he, fashions, from, the, rhinegold, the, title, therefore, denotes, alberich, s, ring, the, cycle, is, a, work, of, extraordinary, scale, a, full, performance, of, the, cycle, takes, place, over, four, nights, at, the, opera, with, a, total, playing, time, of, about, 15, hours, depending, on, the, conductor, s, pacing, the, first, and, shortest, work, das, rheingold, has, no, interval, and, is, one, continuous, piece, of, music, typically, lasting, around, two, and, a, half, hours, while, the, final, and, longest, g, tterd, mmerung, takes, up, to, five, hours, excluding, intervals, the, cycle, is, modelled, after, ancient, greek, dramas, that, were, presented, as, three, tragedies, and, one, satyr, play, the, ring, proper, begins, with, die, walk, re, and, ends, with, g, tterd, mmerung, with, rheingold, as, a, prelude, wagner, called, das, rheingold, a, vorabend, or, preliminary, evening, and, die, walk, re, siegfried, and, g, tterd, mmerung, were, subtitled, first, day, second, day, and, third, day, respectively, of, the, trilogy, proper, the, scale, and, scope, of, the, story, is, epic, it, follows, the, struggles, of, gods, heroes, and, several, mythical, creatures, over, the, eponymous, magic, ring, that, grants, domination, over, the, entire, world, the, drama, and, intrigue, continue, through, three, generations, of, protagonists, until, the, final, cataclysm, at, the, end, of, g, tterd, mmerung, the, music, of, the, cycle, is, thick, and, richly, textured, and, grows, in, complexity, as, the, cycle, proceeds, wagner, wrote, for, an, orchestra, of, gargantuan, proportions, including, a, greatly, enlarged, brass, section, with, new, instruments, such, as, the, wagner, tuba, bass, trumpet, and, contrabass, trombone, remarkably, he, uses, a, chorus, only, relatively, briefly, in, acts, 2, and, 3, of, g, tterd, mmerung, and, then, mostly, of, men, with, just, a, few, women, he, eventually, had, a, purpose, built, theatre, constructed, the, bayreuth, festspielhaus, in, which, to, perform, this, work, the, theatre, has, a, special, stage, that, blends, the, huge, orchestra, with, the, singers, voices, allowing, them, to, sing, at, a, natural, volume, the, result, was, that, the, singers, did, not, have, to, strain, themselves, vocally, during, the, long, performances, w, lsungs, neidings, gibichungs, rhinemaidens, giants, nibelungs, the, plot, revolves, around, a, magic, ring, that, grants, the, power, to, rule, the, world, forged, by, the, nibelung, dwarf, alberich, from, gold, he, stole, from, the, rhine, maidens, in, the, river, rhine, with, the, assistance, of, the, god, loge, wotan, the, chief, of, the, gods, steals, the, ring, from, alberich, but, is, forced, to, hand, it, over, to, the, giants, fafner, and, fasolt, in, payment, for, building, the, home, of, the, gods, valhalla, or, they, will, take, freia, who, provides, the, gods, with, the, golden, apples, that, keep, them, young, wotan, s, schemes, to, regain, the, ring, spanning, generations, drive, much, of, the, action, in, the, story, his, grandson, the, mortal, siegfried, wins, the, ring, by, slaying, fafner, who, slew, fasolt, for, the, ring, as, wotan, intended, but, is, eventually, betrayed, and, slain, as, a, result, of, the, intrigues, of, alberich, s, son, hagen, who, wants, the, ring, for, himself, finally, the, valkyrie, br, nnhilde, siegfried, s, lover, and, wotan, s, daughter, who, lost, her, immortality, for, defying, her, father, in, an, attempt, to, save, siegfried, s, father, sigmund, returns, the, ring, to, the, rhine, maidens, as, she, commits, suicide, on, siegfried, s, funeral, pyre, hagen, is, drowned, as, he, attempts, to, recover, the, ring, in, the, process, the, gods, and, valhalla, are, destroyed, details, of, the, storylines, can, be, found, in, the, articles, on, each, music, drama, wagner, created, the, story, of, the, ring, by, fusing, elements, from, many, german, and, scandinavian, myths, and, folk, tales, the, old, norse, edda, supplied, much, of, the, material, for, das, rheingold, while, die, walk, re, was, largely, based, on, the, v, lsunga, saga, siegfried, contains, elements, from, the, eddur, the, v, lsunga, saga, and, thidrekssaga, the, final, g, tterd, mmerung, draws, from, the, 12th, century, german, poem, the, nibelungenlied, which, appears, to, have, been, the, original, inspiration, for, the, ring, the, ring, has, been, the, subject, of, myriad, interpretations, for, example, george, bernard, shaw, in, the, perfect, wagnerite, argues, for, a, view, of, the, ring, as, an, essentially, socialist, critique, of, industrial, society, and, its, abuses, robert, donington, in, wagner, s, ring, and, its, symbols, interprets, it, in, terms, of, jungian, psychology, as, an, account, of, the, development, of, unconscious, archetypes, in, the, mind, leading, towards, individuation, in, his, earlier, operas, up, to, and, including, lohengrin, wagner, s, style, had, been, based, rather, than, on, the, italian, style, of, opera, on, the, german, style, as, developed, by, carl, maria, von, weber, with, elements, of, the, grand, opera, style, of, giacomo, meyerbeer, however, he, came, to, be, dissatisfied, with, such, a, format, as, a, means, of, artistic, expression, he, expressed, this, clearly, in, his, essay, a, communication, to, my, friends, 1851, in, which, he, condemned, the, majority, of, modern, artists, in, painting, and, in, music, as, feminine, the, world, of, art, close, fenced, from, life, in, which, art, plays, with, herself, where, however, the, impressions, of, life, produce, an, overwhelming, poetic, force, we, find, the, masculine, the, generative, path, of, art, wagner, unfortunately, found, that, his, audiences, were, not, willing, to, follow, where, he, led, them, the, public, by, their, enthusiastic, reception, of, rienzi, and, their, cooler, welcome, of, the, flying, dutchman, had, plainly, shown, me, what, i, must, set, before, them, if, i, sought, to, please, i, completely, undeceived, their, expectations, they, left, the, theatre, after, the, first, performance, of, tannh, user, in, a, confused, and, discontented, mood, the, feeling, of, utter, loneliness, in, which, i, now, found, myself, quite, unmanned, me, my, tannh, user, had, appealed, to, a, handful, of, intimate, friends, alone, finally, wagner, announces, i, shall, never, write, an, opera, more, as, i, have, no, wish, to, invent, an, arbitrary, title, for, my, works, i, will, call, them, dramas, i, propose, to, produce, my, myth, in, three, complete, dramas, preceded, by, a, lengthy, prelude, vorspiel, at, a, specially, appointed, festival, i, propose, some, future, time, to, produce, those, three, dramas, with, their, prelude, in, the, course, of, three, days, and, a, fore, evening, the, object, of, this, production, i, shall, consider, thoroughly, attained, if, i, and, my, artistic, comrades, the, actual, performers, shall, within, these, four, evenings, succeed, in, artistically, conveying, my, purpose, to, the, true, emotional, not, the, critical, understanding, of, spectators, who, shall, have, gathered, together, expressly, to, learn, it, this, is, his, first, public, announcement, of, the, form, of, what, would, become, the, ring, cycle, in, accordance, with, the, ideas, expressed, in, his, essays, of, the, period, 1849, 51, including, the, communication, but, also, opera, and, drama, and, the, artwork, of, the, future, the, four, parts, of, the, ring, were, originally, conceived, by, wagner, to, be, free, of, the, traditional, operatic, concepts, of, aria, and, operatic, chorus, the, wagner, scholar, curt, von, westernhagen, identified, three, important, problems, discussed, in, opera, and, drama, which, were, particularly, relevant, to, the, ring, cycle, the, problem, of, unifying, verse, stress, with, melody, the, disjunctions, caused, by, formal, arias, in, dramatic, structure, and, the, way, in, which, opera, music, could, be, organised, on, a, different, basis, of, organic, growth, and, modulation, and, the, function, of, musical, motifs, in, linking, elements, of, the, plot, whose, connections, might, otherwise, be, inexplicit, this, became, known, as, the, leitmotif, technique, see, below, although, wagner, himself, did, not, use, this, word, however, wagner, relaxed, some, aspects, of, his, self, imposed, restrictions, somewhat, as, the, work, progressed, as, george, bernard, shaw, sardonically, and, slightly, unfairly, noted, of, the, last, opera, g, tterd, mmerung, and, now, o, nibelungen, spectator, pluck, up, for, all, allegories, come, to, an, end, somewhere, the, rest, of, what, you, are, going, to, see, is, opera, and, nothing, but, opera, before, many, bars, have, been, played, siegfried, and, the, wakened, brynhild, newly, become, tenor, and, soprano, will, sing, a, concerted, cadenza, plunge, on, from, that, to, a, magnificent, love, duet, the, work, which, follows, entitled, night, falls, on, the, gods, is, a, thorough, grand, opera, as, a, significant, element, in, the, ring, and, his, subsequent, works, wagner, adopted, the, use, of, leitmotifs, which, are, recurring, themes, or, harmonic, progressions, they, musically, denote, an, action, object, emotion, character, or, other, subject, mentioned, in, the, text, or, presented, onstage, wagner, referred, to, them, in, opera, and, drama, as, guides, to, feeling, describing, how, they, could, be, used, to, inform, the, listener, of, a, musical, or, dramatic, subtext, to, the, action, onstage, in, the, same, way, as, a, greek, chorus, did, for, the, theatre, of, ancient, greece, wagner, made, significant, innovations, in, orchestration, in, this, work, he, wrote, for, a, very, large, orchestra, using, the, whole, range, of, instruments, used, singly, or, in, combination, to, express, the, great, range, of, emotion, and, events, of, the, drama, wagner, even, commissioned, the, production, of, new, instruments, including, the, wagner, tuba, invented, to, fill, a, gap, he, found, between, the, tone, qualities, of, the, horn, and, the, trombone, as, well, as, variations, of, existing, instruments, such, as, the, bass, trumpet, and, a, contrabass, trombone, with, a, double, slide, he, also, developed, the, wagner, bell, enabling, the, bassoon, to, reach, the, low, a, natural, whereas, normally, b, flat, is, the, instrument, s, lowest, note, if, such, a, bell, is, not, to, be, used, then, a, contrabassoon, should, be, employed, all, four, parts, have, a, very, similar, instrumentation, the, core, ensemble, of, instruments, are, one, piccolo, three, flutes, third, doubling, second, piccolo, three, oboes, cor, anglais, doubling, fourth, oboe, three, soprano, clarinets, one, bass, clarinet, three, bassoons, eight, horns, fifth, through, eighth, doubling, wagner, tubas, three, trumpets, one, bass, trumpet, three, tenor, trombones, one, contrabass, trombone, doubling, bass, trombone, one, contrabass, tuba, a, percussion, section, with, 4, timpani, requiring, two, players, triangle, cymbals, tam, tam, six, harps, and, a, string, section, consisting, of, 16, first, and, 16, second, violins, 12, violas, 12, cellos, and, 8, double, basses, das, rheingold, one, offstage, harp, and, 18, offstage, anvils, die, walk, re, requires, one, snare, drum, one, d, clarinet, played, by, the, third, clarinettist, and, an, on, stage, steerhorn, siegfried, requires, one, onstage, cor, anglais, and, one, onstage, horn, g, tterd, mmerung, requires, a, tenor, drum, as, well, as, five, onstage, horns, and, four, onstage, steerhorns, one, of, them, to, be, blown, by, hagen, much, of, the, ring, especially, from, siegfried, act, 3, onwards, cannot, be, said, to, be, in, traditional, clearly, defined, keys, for, long, stretches, but, rather, in, key, regions, each, of, which, flows, smoothly, into, the, following, this, fluidity, avoided, the, musical, equivalent, of, clearly, defined, musical, paragraphs, and, assisted, wagner, in, building, the, work, s, huge, structures, tonal, indeterminacy, was, heightened, by, the, increased, freedom, with, which, he, used, dissonance, and, chromaticism, chromatically, altered, chords, are, used, very, liberally, in, the, ring, and, this, feature, which, is, also, prominent, in, tristan, und, isolde, is, often, cited, as, a, milestone, on, the, way, to, arnold, schoenberg, s, revolutionary, break, with, the, traditional, concept, of, key, and, his, dissolution, of, consonance, as, the, basis, of, an, organising, principle, in, music, in, summer, 1848, wagner, wrote, the, nibelung, myth, as, sketch, for, a, drama, combining, the, medieval, sources, previously, mentioned, into, a, single, narrative, very, similar, to, the, plot, of, the, eventual, ring, cycle, but, nevertheless, with, substantial, differences, later, that, year, he, began, writing, a, libretto, entitled, siegfrieds, tod, siegfried, s, death, he, was, possibly, stimulated, by, a, series, of, articles, in, the, neue, zeitschrift, f, r, musik, inviting, composers, to, write, a, national, opera, based, on, the, nibelungenlied, a, 12th, century, high, german, poem, which, since, its, rediscovery, in, 1755, had, been, hailed, by, the, german, romantics, as, the, german, national, epic, siegfrieds, tod, dealt, with, the, death, of, siegfried, the, central, heroic, figure, of, the, nibelungenlied, the, idea, had, occurred, to, others, the, correspondence, of, fanny, and, felix, mendelssohn, in, 1840, 41, reveals, that, they, were, both, outlining, scenarios, on, the, subject, fanny, wrote, the, hunt, with, siegfried, s, death, provides, a, splendid, finale, to, the, second, act, by, 1850, wagner, had, completed, a, musical, sketch, which, he, abandoned, for, siegfrieds, tod, he, now, felt, that, he, needed, a, preliminary, opera, der, junge, siegfried, the, young, siegfried, later, renamed, to, siegfried, to, explain, the, events, in, siegfrieds, tod, and, his, verse, draft, of, this, was, completed, in, may, 1851, by, october, he, had, made, the, momentous, decision, to, embark, on, a, cycle, of, four, operas, to, be, played, over, four, nights, das, rheingold, die, walk, re, der, junge, siegfried, and, siegfrieds, tod, the, text, for, all, four, parts, was, completed, in, december, 1852, and, privately, published, in, february, 1853, in, november, 1853, wagner, began, the, composition, draft, of, das, rheingold, unlike, the, verses, which, were, written, as, it, were, in, reverse, order, the, music, would, be, composed, in, the, same, order, as, the, narrative, composition, proceeded, until, 1857, when, the, final, score, up, to, the, end, of, act, 2, of, siegfried, was, completed, wagner, then, laid, the, work, aside, for, twelve, years, during, which, he, wrote, tristan, und, isolde, and, die, meistersinger, von, n, rnberg, by, 1869, wagner, was, living, at, tribschen, on, lake, lucerne, sponsored, by, king, ludwig, ii, of, bavaria, he, returned, to, siegfried, and, remarkably, was, able, to, pick, up, where, he, left, off, in, october, he, completed, the, final, work, in, the, cycle, he, chose, the, title, g, tterd, mmerung, instead, of, siegfrieds, tod, in, the, completed, work, the, gods, are, destroyed, in, accordance, with, the, new, pessimistic, thrust, of, the, cycle, not, redeemed, as, in, the, more, optimistic, originally, planned, ending, wagner, also, decided, to, show, onstage, the, events, of, das, rheingold, and, die, walk, re, which, had, hitherto, only, been, presented, as, back, narration, in, the, other, two, parts, these, changes, resulted, in, some, discrepancies, in, the, cycle, but, these, do, not, diminish, the, value, of, the, work, on, king, ludwig, s, insistence, and, over, wagner, s, objections, special, previews, of, das, rheingold, and, die, walk, re, were, given, at, the, national, theatre, in, munich, before, the, rest, of, the, ring, thus, das, rheingold, premiered, on, 22, september, 1869, and, die, walk, re, on, 26, june, 1870, wagner, subsequently, delayed, announcing, his, completion, of, siegfried, to, prevent, this, work, also, being, premiered, against, his, wishes, wagner, had, long, desired, to, have, a, special, festival, opera, house, designed, by, himself, for, the, performance, of, the, ring, in, 1871, he, decided, on, a, location, in, the, bavarian, town, of, bayreuth, in, 1872, he, moved, to, bayreuth, and, the, foundation, stone, was, laid, wagner, would, spend, the, next, two, years, attempting, to, raise, capital, for, the, construction, with, scant, success, king, ludwig, finally, rescued, the, project, in, 1874, by, donating, the, needed, funds, the, bayreuth, festspielhaus, opened, in, 1876, with, the, first, complete, performance, of, the, ring, which, took, place, from, 13, to, 17, august, in, 1882, london, impresario, alfred, schulz, curtius, organized, the, first, staging, in, the, united, kingdom, of, the, ring, cycle, conducted, by, anton, seidl, and, directed, by, angelo, neumann, the, first, production, of, the, ring, in, italy, was, in, venice, the, place, where, wagner, died, just, two, months, after, his, 1883, death, at, la, fenice, the, first, australian, ring, and, the, mastersingers, of, nuremberg, was, presented, in, an, english, language, production, by, the, british, travelling, quinlan, opera, company, in, conjunction, with, j, c, williamson, s, in, melbourne, and, sydney, in, 1913, the, ring, is, a, major, undertaking, for, any, opera, company, staging, four, interlinked, operas, requires, a, huge, commitment, both, artistically, and, financially, hence, in, most, opera, houses, production, of, a, new, ring, cycle, will, happen, over, a, number, of, years, with, one, or, two, operas, in, the, cycle, being, added, each, year, the, bayreuth, festival, where, the, complete, cycle, is, performed, most, years, is, unusual, in, that, a, new, cycle, is, almost, always, created, within, a, single, year, early, productions, of, the, ring, cycle, stayed, close, to, wagner, s, original, bayreuth, staging, trends, set, at, bayreuth, have, continued, to, be, influential, following, the, closure, of, the, festspielhaus, during, the, second, world, war, the, 1950s, saw, productions, by, wagner, s, grandsons, wieland, and, wolfgang, wagner, known, as, the, new, bayreuth, style, which, emphasised, the, human, aspects, of, the, drama, in, a, more, abstract, setting, perhaps, the, most, famous, modern, production, was, the, centennial, production, of, 1976, the, jahrhundertring, directed, by, patrice, ch, reau, and, conducted, by, pierre, boulez, set, in, the, industrial, revolution, it, replaced, the, depths, of, the, rhine, with, a, hydroelectric, power, dam, and, featured, grimy, sets, populated, by, men, and, gods, in, 19th, and, 20th, century, business, suits, this, drew, heavily, on, the, reading, of, the, ring, as, a, revolutionary, drama, and, critique, of, the, modern, world, famously, expounded, by, george, bernard, shaw, in, the, perfect, wagnerite, early, performances, were, booed, but, the, audience, of, 1980, gave, it, a, 45, minute, ovation, in, its, final, year, seattle, opera, has, created, three, different, productions, of, the, tetralogy, ring, 1, 1975, to, 1984, originally, directed, by, george, london, with, designs, by, john, naccarato, following, the, famous, illustrations, by, arthur, rackham, it, was, performed, twice, each, summer, once, in, german, once, in, andrew, porter, s,

sullivan, and, supertitles, the, first, ever, created, for, the, ring, by, sonya, friedman, the, production, set, the, action, in, a, world, of, nineteenth, century, theatricality, it, was, initially, controversial, in, 1985, it, sold, out, its, final, performances, in, 1995, conductors, included, armin, jordan, die, walk, re, in, 1985, manuel, rosenthal, 1986, and, hermann, michael, 1987, 1991, and, 1995, ring, 3, 2000, 2013, the, production, which, became, known, as, the, green, ring, was, in, part, inspired, by, the, natural, beauty, of, the, pacific, northwest, directed, by, stephen,
