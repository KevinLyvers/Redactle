one, of, the, plastic, arts, ceramic, art, is, a, visual, art, while, some, ceramics, are, considered, fine, art, such, as, pottery, or, sculpture, most, are, considered, to, be, decorative, industrial, or, applied, art, objects, ceramic, art, can, be, created, by, one, person, or, by, a, group, in, a, pottery, or, a, ceramic, factory, with, a, group, designing, and, manufacturing, the, artware, in, britain, and, the, united, states, modern, ceramics, as, an, art, took, its, inspiration, in, the, early, twentieth, century, from, the, arts, and, crafts, movement, leading, to, the, revival, of, pottery, considered, as, a, specifically, modern, craft, such, crafts, emphasized, traditional, non, industrial, production, techniques, faithfulness, to, the, material, the, skills, of, the, individual, maker, attention, to, utility, and, an, absence, of, excessive, decoration, that, was, typical, to, the, victorian, era, the, word, ceramics, comes, from, the, greek, keramikos, meaning, pottery, which, in, turn, comes, from, keramos, meaning, potter, s, clay, most, traditional, ceramic, products, were, made, from, clay, or, clay, mixed, with, other, materials, shaped, and, subjected, to, heat, and, tableware, and, decorative, ceramics, are, generally, still, made, this, way, in, modern, ceramic, engineering, usage, ceramics, is, the, art, and, science, of, making, objects, from, inorganic, non, metallic, materials, by, the, action, of, heat, it, excludes, glass, and, mosaic, made, from, glass, tesserae, there, is, a, long, history, of, ceramic, art, in, almost, all, developed, cultures, and, often, ceramic, objects, are, all, the, artistic, evidence, left, from, vanished, cultures, like, that, of, the, nok, in, africa, over, 2, 000, years, ago, cultures, especially, noted, for, ceramics, include, the, chinese, cretan, greek, persian, mayan, japanese, and, korean, cultures, as, well, as, the, modern, western, cultures, elements, of, ceramic, art, upon, which, different, degrees, of, emphasis, have, been, placed, at, different, times, are, the, shape, of, the, object, its, decoration, by, painting, carving, and, other, methods, and, the, glazing, found, on, most, ceramics, different, types, of, clay, when, used, with, different, minerals, and, firing, conditions, are, used, to, produce, different, types, of, ceramic, including, earthenware, stoneware, porcelain, and, bone, china, earthenware, is, pottery, that, has, not, been, fired, to, vitrification, and, is, thus, permeable, to, water, many, types, of, pottery, have, been, made, from, it, from, the, earliest, times, and, until, the, 18th, century, it, was, the, most, common, type, of, pottery, outside, the, far, east, earthenware, is, often, made, from, clay, quartz, and, feldspar, terracotta, a, type, of, earthenware, is, a, clay, based, unglazed, or, glazed, ceramic, where, the, fired, body, is, porous, its, uses, include, vessels, notably, flower, pots, water, and, waste, water, pipes, bricks, and, surface, embellishment, in, building, construction, terracotta, has, been, a, common, medium, for, ceramic, art, see, below, stoneware, is, a, vitreous, or, semi, vitreous, ceramic, made, primarily, from, stoneware, clay, or, non, refractory, fire, clay, stoneware, is, fired, at, high, temperatures, vitrified, or, not, it, is, nonporous, it, may, or, may, not, be, glazed, one, widely, recognised, definition, is, from, the, combined, nomenclature, of, the, european, communities, a, european, industry, standard, states, stoneware, which, though, dense, impermeable, and, hard, enough, to, resist, scratching, by, a, steel, point, differs, from, porcelain, because, it, is, more, opaque, and, normally, only, partially, vitrified, it, may, be, vitreous, or, semi, vitreous, it, is, usually, coloured, grey, or, brownish, because, of, impurities, in, the, clay, used, for, its, manufacture, and, is, normally, glazed, porcelain, is, a, ceramic, material, made, by, heating, materials, generally, including, kaolin, in, a, kiln, to, temperatures, between, 1, 200, and, 1, 400, c, 2, 200, and, 2, 600, f, the, toughness, strength, and, translucence, of, porcelain, relative, to, other, types, of, pottery, arises, mainly, from, vitrification, and, the, formation, of, the, mineral, mullite, within, the, body, at, these, high, temperatures, properties, associated, with, porcelain, include, low, permeability, and, elasticity, considerable, strength, hardness, toughness, whiteness, translucency, and, resonance, and, a, high, resistance, to, chemical, attack, and, thermal, shock, porcelain, has, been, described, as, being, completely, vitrified, hard, impermeable, even, before, glazing, white, or, artificially, coloured, translucent, except, when, of, considerable, thickness, and, resonant, however, the, term, porcelain, lacks, a, universal, definition, and, has, been, applied, in, a, very, unsystematic, fashion, to, substances, of, diverse, kinds, which, have, only, certain, surface, qualities, in, common, bone, china, is, a, type, of, soft, paste, porcelain, that, is, composed, of, bone, ash, feldspathic, material, and, kaolin, it, has, been, defined, as, ware, with, a, translucent, body, containing, a, minimum, of, 30, of, phosphate, derived, from, animal, bone, and, calculated, calcium, phosphate, developed, by, english, potter, josiah, spode, bone, china, is, known, for, its, high, levels, of, whiteness, and, translucency, and, very, high, mechanical, strength, and, chip, resistance, its, high, strength, allows, it, to, be, produced, in, thinner, cross, sections, than, other, types, of, porcelain, like, stoneware, it, is, vitrified, but, is, translucent, due, to, differing, mineral, properties, from, its, initial, development, and, up, to, the, later, part, of, the, twentieth, century, bone, china, was, almost, exclusively, an, english, product, with, production, being, effectively, localised, in, stoke, on, trent, most, major, english, firms, made, or, still, make, it, including, mintons, coalport, spode, royal, crown, derby, royal, doulton, wedgwood, and, worcester, in, the, uk, references, to, china,

in, 18th, century, europe, the, broader, term, ceramic, painting, includes, painted, decoration, on, lead, glazed, earthenware, such, as, creamware, or, tin, glazed, pottery, such, as, maiolica, or, faience, typically, the, body, is, first, fired, in, a, kiln, to, convert, it, into, a, hard, porous, biscuit, underglaze, decoration, may, then, be, applied, followed, by, ceramic, glaze, which, is, fired, so, it, bonds, to, the, body, the, glazed, porcelain, may, then, be, decorated, with, overglaze, painting, and, fired, again, at, a, lower, temperature, to, bond, the, paint, with, the, glaze, decoration, may, be, applied, by, brush, or, by, stenciling, transfer, printing, lithography, and, screen, printing, slipware, is, a, type, of, pottery, identified, by, its, primary, decorating, process, where, slip, is, placed, onto, the, leather, hard, clay, body, surface, before, firing, by, dipping, painting, or, splashing, slip, is, an, aqueous, suspension, of, a, clay, body, which, is, a, mixture, of, clays, and, other, minerals, such, as, quartz, feldspar, and, mica, a, coating, of, white, or, coloured, slip, known, as, an, engobe, can, be, applied, to, the, article, to, improve,

layers, of, slip, and, or, sgraffito, can, be, done, while, the, pot, is, still, in, an, unfired, state, one, colour, of, slip, can, be, fired, before, a, second, is, applied, and, prior, to, the, scratching, or, incising, decoration, this, is, particularly, useful, if, the, base, body, is, not, of, the, desired, colour, or, texture, in, sharp, contrast, to, the, archaeological, usage, in, which, the, term, terra, sigillata, refers, to, a, whole, class, of, pottery, in, contemporary, ceramic, art, terra, sigillata, describes, only, a, watery, refined, slip, used, to, facilitate, the,

the, town, buildings, of, victorian, birmingham, england, there, is, a, long, history, of, ceramic, art, in, almost, all, developed, cultures, and, often, ceramic, objects, are, all, the, artistic, evidence, left, from, vanished, cultures, like, that, of, the, nok, in, africa, over, 3, 000, years, ago, cultures, especially, noted, for, ceramics, include, the, chinese, cretan, greek, persian, mayan, japanese, and, korean, cultures, as, well, as, the, modern, western, cultures, there, is, evidence, that, pottery, was, independently, invented, in, several, regions, of, the, world, including, east, asia, sub, saharan, africa, the, near, east, and, the, americas, although, pottery, figurines, are, found, from, earlier, periods, in, europe, the, oldest, pottery, vessels, come, from, east, asia, with, finds, in, china, and, japan, then, still, linked, by, a, land, bridge, and, some, in, what, is, now, the, russian, far, east, providing, several, from, 20, 000, to, 10, 000, bce, although, the, vessels, were, simple, utilitarian, objects, xianrendong, cave, in, jiangxi, province, contained, pottery, fragments, that, date, back, to, 20, 000, years, ago, these, early, pottery, containers, were, made, well, before, the, invention, of, agriculture, by, mobile, foragers, who, hunted, and, gathered, their, food, during, the, late, glacial, maximum, many, of, the, pottery, fragments, had, scorch, marks, suggesting, that, the, pottery, was, used, for, cooking, many, remarkable, containers, were, made, from, stone, before, the, invention, of, pottery, in, western, asia, which, occurred, around, 7, 000, bc, and, before, the, invention, of, agriculture, the, natufian, culture, created, elegant, stone, mortars, during, the, period, between, 12, 000, and, 9, 500, bc, around, 8000, bc, several, early, settlements, became, experts, in, crafting, beautiful, and, highly, sophisticated, containers, from, stone, using, materials, such, as, alabaster, or, granite, and, employing, sand, to, shape, and, polish, artisans, used, the, veins, in, the, material, to, maximize, visual, effect, such, object, have, been, found, in, abundance, on, the, upper, euphrates, river, in, what, is, today, eastern, syria, especially, at, the, site, of, bouqras, these, form, the, early, stages, of, the, development, of, the, art, of, mesopotamia, early, pots, were, made, by, what, is, known, as, the, coiling, method, which, worked, the, clay, into, a, long, string, that, wound, to, form, a, shape, that, later, made, smooth, walls, the, potter, s, wheel, was, probably, invented, in, mesopotamia, by, the, 4th, millennium, bce, but, spread, across, nearly, all, eurasia, and, much, of, africa, though, it, remained, unknown, in, the, new, world, until, the, arrival, of, europeans, decoration, of, the, clay, by, incising, and, painting, is, found, very, widely, and, was, initially, geometric, but, often, included, figurative, designs, from, very, early, on, so, important, is, pottery, to, the, archaeology, of, prehistoric, cultures, that, many, are, known, by, names, taken, from, their, distinctive, and, often, very, fine, pottery, such, as, the, linear, pottery, culture, beaker, culture, globular, amphora, culture, corded, ware, culture, and, funnelbeaker, culture, to, take, examples, only, from, neolithic, europe, approximately, 7000, 1800, bce, ceramic, art, has, generated, many, styles, from, its, own, tradition, but, is, often, closely, related, to, contemporary, sculpture, and, metalwork, many, times, in, its, history, styles, from, the, usually, more, prestigious, and, expensive, art, of, metalworking, have, been, copied, in, ceramics, this, can, be, seen, in, early, chinese, ceramics, such, as, pottery, and, ceramic, wares, of, the, shang, dynasty, in, ancient, roman, and, iranian, pottery, and, rococo, european, styles, copying, contemporary, silverware, shapes, a, common, use, of, ceramics, is, for, pots, containers, such, as, bowls, vases, and, amphorae, as, well, as, other, tableware, but, figurines, have, been, very, widely, made, the, earliest, evidence, of, glazed, brick, is, the, discovery, of, glazed, bricks, in, the, elamite, temple, at, chogha, zanbil, dated, to, the, 13th, century, bce, glazed, and, coloured, bricks, were, used, to, make, low, reliefs, in, ancient, mesopotamia, most, famously, the, ishtar, gate, of, babylon, c, 575, bce, now, partly, reconstructed, in, berlin, with, sections, elsewhere, mesopotamian, craftsmen, were, imported, for, the, palaces, of, the, persian, empire, such, as, persepolis, the, tradition, continued, and, after, the, islamic, conquest, of, persia, coloured, and, often, painted, glazed, bricks, or, tiles, became, an, important, element, in, persian, architecture, and, from, there, spread, to, much, of, the, islamic, world, notably, the, znik, pottery, of, turkey, under, the, ottoman, empire, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, using, the, lusterware, technology, one, of, the, finest, examples, of, medieval, islamic, use, of, ceramics, as, wall, decoration, can, be, seen, in, the, mosque, of, uqba, also, known, as, the, great, mosque, of, kairouan, in, tunisia, the, upper, part, of, the, mihrab, wall, is, adorned, with, polychrome, and, monochrome, lusterware, tiles, dating, from, 862, to, 863, these, tiles, were, most, probably, imported, from, mesopotamia, transmitted, via, islamic, iberia, a, new, tradition, of, azulejos, developed, in, spain, and, especially, portugal, which, by, the, baroque, period, produced, extremely, large, painted, scenes, on, tiles, usually, in, blue, and, white, delftware, tiles, typically, with, a, painted, design, covering, only, one, rather, small, tile, were, ubiquitous, in, the, netherlands, and, widely, exported, over, northern, europe, from, the, 16th, century, on, several, 18th, century, royal, palaces, had, porcelain, rooms, with, the, walls, entirely, covered, in, porcelain, surviving, examples, include, ones, at, capodimonte, naples, the, royal, palace, of, madrid, and, the, nearby, royal, palace, of, aranjuez, elaborate, cocklestoves, were, a, feature, of, rooms, of, the, middle, and, upper, classes, in, northern, europe, from, the, 17th, to, 19th, centuries, there, are, several, other, types, of, traditional, tiles, that, remain, in, manufacture, for, example, the, small, almost, mosaic, brightly, coloured, zellige, tiles, of, morocco, with, exceptions, notably, the, porcelain, tower, of, nanjing, tiles, or, glazed, bricks, do, not, feature, largely, in, east, asian, ceramics, although, pottery, figurines, are, found, from, earlier, periods, in, europe, the, oldest, pottery, vessels, come, from, east, asia, with, finds, in, china, and, japan, then, still, linked, by, a, land, bridge, and, some, in, what, is, now, the, russian, far, east, providing, several, from, between, 20, 000, and, 10, 000, bce, although, the, vessels, were, simple, utilitarian, objects, xianrendong, cave, in, jiangxi, province, contained, pottery, fragments, that, date, back, to, 20, 000, years, ago, recent, archaeological, excavations, at, angkor, borei, in, southern, cambodia, have, recovered, a, large, number, of, ceramics, some, of, which, probably, date, back, to, the, prehistoric, period, most, of, the, pottery, however, dates, to, the, pre, angkorian, period, and, consists, mainly, of, pinkish, terracotta, pots, which, were, either, hand, made, or, thrown, on, a, wheel, and, then, decorated, with, incised, patterns, glazed, wares, first, appear, in, the, archaeological, record, at, the, end, of, the, 9th, century, at, the, roluos, temple, group, in, the, angkor, region, where, green, glazed, pot, shards, have, been, found, a, brown, glaze, became, popular, at, the, beginning, of, the, 11th, century, and, brown, glazed, wares, have, been, found, in, abundance, at, khmer, sites, in, northeast, thailand, decorating, pottery, with, animal, forms, was, a, popular, style, from, the, 11th, to, 13th, century, archaeological, excavations, in, the, angkor, region, have, revealed, that, towards, the, end, of, angkor, period, production, of, indigenous, pottery, declined, while, there, was, a, dramatic, increase, in, chinese, ceramic, imports, direct, evidence, of, the, shapes, of, vessels, is, provided, by, scenes, depicted, on, bas, reliefs, at, khmer, temples, which, also, offer, insight, into, domestic, and, ritualistic, uses, of, the, wares, the, wide, range, of, utilitarian, shapes, suggest, the, khmers, used, ceramics, in, their, daily, life, for, cooking, food, preservation, carrying, and, storing, liquids, as, containers, for, medicinal, herbs, perfumes, and, cosmetics, there, is, chinese, porcelain, from, the, late, eastern, han, period, 100, 200, ce, the, three, kingdoms, period, 220, 280, ce, the, six, dynasties, period, 220, 589, ce, and, thereafter, china, in, particular, has, had, a, continuous, history, of, large, scale, production, with, the, imperial, factories, usually, producing, the, best, work, the, tang, dynasty, 618, to, 906, ce, is, especially, noted, for, grave, goods, figures, of, humans, animals, and, model, houses, boats, and, other, goods, excavated, usually, illegally, from, graves, in, large, numbers, some, experts, believe, the, first, true, porcelain, was, made, in, the, province, of, zhejiang, in, china, during, the, eastern, han, period, shards, recovered, from, archaeological, eastern, han, kiln, sites, estimated, firing, temperature, ranged, from, 1, 260, to, 1, 300, c, 2, 300, to, 2, 370, f, as, far, back, as, 1000, bce, the, so, called, porcelaneous, wares, or, proto, porcelain, wares, were, made, using, at, least, some, kaolin, fired, at, high, temperatures, the, dividing, line, between, the, two, and, true, porcelain, wares, is, not, a, clear, one, archaeological, finds, have, pushed, the, dates, to, as, early, as, the, han, dynasty, 206, bce, 220, ce, the, imperial, porcelain, of, the, song, dynasty, 960, 1279, featuring, very, subtle, decoration, shallowly, carved, by, knife, in, the, clay, is, regarded, by, many, authorities, as, the, peak, of, chinese, ceramics, though, the, large, and, more, exuberantly, painted, ceramics, of, the, ming, dynasty, 1368, 1644, have, a, wider, reputation, chinese, emperors, gave, ceramics, as, diplomatic, gifts, on, a, lavish, scale, and, the, presence, of, chinese, ceramics, no, doubt, aided, the, development, of, related, traditions, of, ceramics, in, japan, and, korea, in, particular, until, the, 16th, century, small, quantities, of, expensive, chinese, porcelain, were, imported, into, europe, from, the, 16th, century, onwards, attempts, were, made, to, imitate, it, in, europe, including, soft, paste, and, the, medici, porcelain, made, in, florence, none, was, successful, until, a, recipe, for, hard, paste, porcelain, was, devised, at, the, meissen, factory, in, dresden, in, 1710, within, a, few, years, porcelain, factories, sprung, up, at, nymphenburg, in, bavaria, 1754, and, capodimonte, in, naples, 1743, and, many, other, places, often, financed, by, a, local, ruler, the, earliest, japanese, pottery, was, made, around, the, 11th, millennium, bce, j, mon, ware, emerged, in, the, 6th, millennium, bce, and, the, plainer, yayoi, style, in, about, the, 4th, century, bce, this, early, pottery, was, soft, earthenware, fired, at, low, temperatures, the, potter, s, wheel, and, a, kiln, capable, of, reaching, higher, temperatures, and,

picasso, who, produced, pottery, using, tin, glazes, until, the, 16th, century, small, quantities, of, expensive, chinese, porcelain, were, imported, into, europe, from, the, 16th, century, onwards, attempts, were, made, to, imitate, it, in, europe, including, soft, paste, and, the, medici, porcelain, made, in, florence, in, 1712, many, of, the, elaborate, chinese, porcelain, manufacturing, secrets, were, revealed, throughout, europe, by, the, french, jesuit, father, francois, xavier, d, entrecolles, and, soon, published, in, the, lettres, difiantes, et, curieuses, de, chine, par, des, missionnaires, j, suites, after, much, experimentation, a, recipe, for, hard, paste, porcelain, was, devised, at, the, meissen, porcelain, factory, in, dresden, soon, after, 1710, and, was, on, sale, by, 1713, within, a, few, decades, porcelain, factories, sprung, up, at, nymphenburg, in, bavaria, 1754, and, capodimonte, in, naples, 1743, and, many, other, places, often, financed, by, a, local, ruler, soft, paste, porcelain, was, made, at, rouen, in, the, 1680s, but, the, first, important, production, was, at, st, cloud, letters, patent, being, granted, in, 1702, the, duc, de, bourbon, established, a, soft, paste, factory, the, chantilly, porcelain, in, the, grounds, of, his, ch, teau, de, chantilly, in, 1730, a, soft, paste, factory, was, opened, at, mennecy, and, the, vincennes, factory, was, set, up, by, workers, from, chantilly, in, 1740, moving, to, larger, premises, at, s, vres, in, 1756, the, superior, soft, paste, made, at, s, vres, put, it, in, the, leading, position, in, europe, in, the, second, half, of, the, 18th, century, the, first, soft, paste, in, england, was, demonstrated, in, 1742, apparently, based, on, the, saint, cloud, formula, in, 1749, a, patent, was, taken, out, on, the, first, bone, china, subsequently, perfected, by, josiah, spode, the, main, english, porcelain, makers, in, the, 18th, century, were, at, chelsea, bow, st, james, s, bristol, derby, and, lowestoft, porcelain, was, ideally, suited, to, the, energetic, rococo, curves, of, the, day, the, products, of, these, early, decades, of, european, porcelain, are, generally, the, most, highly, regarded, and, expensive, the, meissen, modeler, johann, joachim, kaendler, and, franz, anton, bustelli, of, nymphenburg, are, perhaps, the, most, outstanding, ceramic, artists, of, the, period, like, other, leading, modelers, they, trained, as, sculptors, and, produced, models, from, which, moulds, were, taken, by, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, owning, porcelain, tableware, and, decorative, objects, had, become, obligatory, among, the, prosperous, middle, classes, of, europe, and, there, were, factories, in, most, countries, many, of, which, are, still, producing, as, well, as, tableware, early, european, porcelain, revived, the, taste, for, purely, decorative, figures, of, people, or, animals, which, had, also, been, a, feature, of, several, ancient, cultures, often, as, grave, goods, these, were, still, being, produced, in, china, as, blanc, de, chine, religious, figures, many, of, which, had, reached, europe, european, figures, were, almost, entirely, secular, and, soon, brightly, and, brilliantly, painted, often, in, groups, with, a, modelled, setting, and, a, strong, narrative, element, see, picture, from, the, 17th, century, stoke, on, trent, in, north, staffordshire, emerged, as, a, major, centre, of, pottery, making, important, contributions, to, the, development, of, the, industry, were, made, by, the, firms, of, wedgwood, spode, royal, doulton, and, minton, the, local, presence, of, abundant, supplies, of, coal, and, suitable, clay, for, earthenware, production, led, to, the, early, but, at, first, limited, development, of, the, local, pottery, industry, the, construction, of, the, trent, and, mersey, canal, allowed, the, easy, transportation, of, china, clay, from, cornwall, together, with, other, materials, and, facilitated, the, production, of, creamware, and, bone, china, other, production, centres, had, a, lead, in, the, production, of, high, quality, wares, but, the, preeminence, of, north, staffordshire, was, brought, about, by, methodical, and, detailed, research, and, a, willingness, to, experiment, carried, out, over, many, years, initially, by, one, man, josiah, wedgwood, his, lead, was, followed, by, other, local, potters, scientists, and, engineers, wedgwood, is, credited, with, the, industrialization, of, the, manufacture, of, pottery, his, work, was, of, very, high, quality, when, visiting, his, workshop, if, he, saw, an, offending, vessel, that, failed, to, meet, with, his, standards, he, would, smash, it, with, his, stick, exclaiming, this, will, not, do, for, josiah, wedgwood, he, was, keenly, interested, in, the, scientific, advances, of, his, day, and, it, was, this, interest, that, underpinned, his, adoption, of, its, approach, and, methods, to, revolutionize, the, quality, of, his, pottery, his, unique, glazes, began, to, distinguish, his, wares, from, anything, else, on, the, market, his, matt, finish, jasperware, in, two, colours, was, highly, suitable, for, the, neoclassicism, of, the, end, of, the, century, imitating, the, effects, of, ancient, roman, carved, gemstone, cameos, like, the, gemma, augustea, or, the, cameo, glass, portland, vase, of, which, wedgwood, produced, copies, he, also, is, credited, with, perfecting, transfer, printing, first, developed, in, england, about, 1750, by, the, end, of, the, century, this, had, largely, replaced, hand, painting, for, complex, designs, except, at, the, luxury, end, of, the, market, and, the, vast, majority, of, the, world, s, decorated, pottery, uses, versions, of, the, technique, to, the, present, day, the, perfecting, of, underglaze, transfer, printing, is, widely, credited, to, josiah, spode, the, first, the, process, had, been, used, as, a, development, from, the, processes, used, in, book, printing, and, early, paper, quality, made, a, very, refined, detail, in, the, design, incapable, of, reproduction, so, early, print, patterns, were, rather, lacking, in, subtlety, of, tonal, variation, the, development, of, machine, made, thinner, printing, papers, around, 1804, allowed, the, engravers, to, use, a, much, wider, variety, of, tonal, techniques, which, became, capable, of, being, reproduced, on, the, ware, much, more, successfully, far, from, perfecting, underglaze, print, wedgwood, was, persuaded, by, his, painters, not, to, adopt, underglaze, printing, until, it, became, evident, that, mr, spode, was, taking, away, his, business, through, competitive, pricing, for, a, much, more, heavily, decorated, high, quality, product, stoke, on, trent, s, supremacy, in, pottery, manufacture, nurtured, and, attracted, a, large, number, of, ceramic, artists, including, clarice, cliff, susie, cooper, lorna, bailey, charlotte, rhead, frederick, hurten,

dora, billington, lucie, rie, and, hans, coper, bernard, leach, 1887, 1979, established, a, style, of, pottery, influenced, by, far, eastern, and, medieval, english, forms, after, briefly, experimenting, with, earthenware, he, turned, to, stoneware, fired, to, high, temperatures, in, large, oil, or, wood, burning, kilns, this, style, dominated, british, studio, pottery, in, the, mid, 20th, century, the, austrian, refugee, lucie, rie, 1902, 1995, has, been, regarded, as, essentially, a, modernist, who, experimented, with, new, glaze, effects, on, often, brightly, coloured, bowls, and, bottles, hans, coper, 1920, 1981, produced, non, functional, sculptural, and, unglazed, pieces, after, the, second, world, war, studio, pottery, in, britain, was, encouraged, by, the, wartime, ban, on, decorating, manufactured, pottery, and, the, modernist, spirit, of, the, festival, of, britain, the, simple, functional, designs, chimed, in, with, the, modernist, ethos, several, potteries, were, formed, in, response, to, this, fifties, boom, and, this, style, of, studio, pottery, remained, popular, into, the, nineteen, seventies, elizabeth, fritsch, 1940, took, up, ceramics, working, under, hans, coper, at, the, royal, college, of, art, 1968, 1971, fritsch, was, one, of, a, group, of, outstanding, ceramicists, who, emerged, from, the, royal, college, of, art, at, that, time,
