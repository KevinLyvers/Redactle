folk, mythological, religious, and, classical, references, poe, claimed, to, have, written, the, poem, logically, and, methodically, with, the, intention, to, create, a, poem, that, would, appeal, to, both, critical, and, popular, tastes, as, he, explained, in, his, 1846, follow, up, essay, the, philosophy, of, composition, the, poem, was, inspired, in, part, by, a, talking, raven, in, the, novel,

poe, popular, in, his, lifetime, although, it, did, not, bring, him, much, financial, success, the, poem, was, soon, reprinted, parodied, and, illustrated, critical, opinion, is, divided, as, to, the, poem, s, literary, status, but, it, nevertheless, remains, one, of, the, most, famous, poems, ever, written, once, upon, a, midnight, dreary, while, i, pondered, weak, and, weary, over, many, a, quaint, and, curious, volume, of, forgotten, lore, while, i, nodded, nearly, napping, suddenly, there, came, a, tapping, as, of, some, one, gently, rapping, rapping, at, my, chamber, door, tis, some, visiter, i, muttered, tapping, at, my, chamber, door, only, this, and, nothing, more, ah, distinctly, i, remember, it, was, in, the, bleak, december, and, each, separate, dying, ember, wrought, its, ghost, upon, the, floor, eagerly, i, wished, the, morrow, vainly, i, had, sought, to, borrow, from, my, books, surcease, of, sorrow, sorrow, for, the, lost, lenore, for, the, rare, and, radiant, maiden, whom, the, angels, name, lenore, nameless, here, for, evermore, and, the, silken, sad, uncertain, rustling, of, each, purple, curtain, thrilled, me, filled, me, with, fantastic, terrors, never, felt, before, so, that, now, to, still, the, beating, of, my, heart, i, stood, repeating, tis, some, visiter, entreating, entrance, at, my, chamber, door, some, late, visiter, entreating, entrance, at, my, chamber, door, this, it, is, and, nothing, more, presently, my, soul, grew, stronger, hesitating, then, no, longer, sir, said, i, or, madam, truly, your, forgiveness, i, implore, but, the, fact, is, i, was, napping, and, so, gently, you, came, rapping, and, so, faintly, you, came, tapping, tapping, at, my, chamber, door, that, i, scarce, was, sure, i, heard, you, here, i, opened, wide, the, door, darkness, there, and, nothing, more, deep, into, that, darkness, peering, long, i, stood, there, wondering, fearing, doubting, dreaming, dreams, no, mortal, ever, dared, to, dream, before, but, the, silence, was, unbroken, and, the, stillness, gave, no, token, and, the, only, word, there, spoken, was, the, whispered, word, lenore, this, i, whispered, and, an, echo, murmured, back, the, word, lenore, merely, this, and, nothing, more, back, into, the, chamber, turning, all, my, soul, within, me, burning, soon, again, i, heard, a, tapping, somewhat, louder, than, before, surely, said, i, surely, that, is, something, at, my, window, lattice, let, me, see, then, what, thereat, is, and, this, mystery, explore, let, my, heart, be, still, a, moment, and, this, mystery, explore, tis, the, wind, and, nothing, more, open, here, i, flung, the, shutter, when, with, many, a, flirt, and, flutter, in, there, stepped, a, stately, raven, of, the, saintly, days, of, yore, not, the, least, obeisance, made, he, not, a, minute, stopped, or, stayed, he, but, with, mien, of, lord, or, lady, perched, above, my, chamber, door, perched, upon, a, bust, of, pallas, just, above, my, chamber, door, perched, and, sat, and, nothing, more, then, this, ebony, bird, beguiling, my, sad, fancy, into, smiling, by, the, grave, and, stern, decorum, of, the, countenance, it, wore, though, thy, crest, be, shorn, and, shaven, thou, i, said, art, sure, no, craven, ghastly, grim, and, ancient, raven, wandering, from, the, nightly, shore, tell, me, what, thy, lordly, name, is, on, the, night, s, plutonian, shore, quoth, the, raven, nevermore, much, i, marvelled, this, ungainly, fowl, to, hear, discourse, so, plainly, though, its, answer, little, meaning, little, relevancy, bore, for, we, cannot, help, agreeing, that, no, living, human, being, ever, yet, was, blessed, with, seeing, bird, above, his, chamber, door, bird, or, beast, upon, the, sculptured, bust, above, his, chamber, door, with, such, name, as, nevermore, but, the, raven, sitting, lonely, on, the, placid, bust, spoke, only, that, one, word, as, if, his, soul, in, that, one, word, he, did, outpour, nothing, farther, then, he, uttered, not, a, feather, then, he, fluttered, till, i, scarcely, more, than, muttered, other, friends, have, flown, before, on, the, morrow, he, will, leave, me, as, my, hopes, have, flown, before, then, the, bird, said, nevermore, startled, at, the, stillness, broken, by, reply, so, aptly, spoken, doubtless, said, i, what, it, utters, is, its, only, stock, and, store, caught, from, some, unhappy, master, whom, unmerciful, disaster, followed, fast, and, followed, faster, till, his, songs, one, burden, bore, till, the, dirges, of, his, hope, that, melancholy, burden, bore, of, never, nevermore, but, the, raven, still, beguiling, my, sad, fancy, into, smiling, straight, i, wheeled, a, cushioned, seat, in, front, of, bird, and, bust, and, door, then, upon, the, velvet, sinking, i, betook, myself, to, linking, fancy, unto, fancy, thinking, what, this, ominous, bird, of, yore, what, this, grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and, ominous, bird, of, yore, meant, in, croaking, nevermore, this, i, sat, engaged, in, guessing, but, no, syllable, expressing, to, the, fowl, whose, fiery, eyes, now, burned, into, my, bosom, s, core, this, and, more, i, sat, divining, with, my, head, at, ease, reclining, on, the, cushion, s, velvet, lining, that, the, lamp, light, gloated, o, er, but, whose, velvet, violet, lining, with, the, lamp, light, gloating, o, er, she, shall, press, ah, nevermore, then, methought, the, air, grew, denser, perfumed, from, an, unseen, censer, swung, by, seraphim, whose, foot, falls, tinkled, on, the, tufted, floor, wretch, i, cried, thy, god, hath, lent, thee, by, these, angels, he, hath, sent, thee, respite, respite, and, nepenthe, from, thy, memories, of, lenore, quaff, oh, quaff, this, kind, nepenthe, and, forget, this, lost, lenore, quoth, the, raven, nevermore, prophet, said, i, thing, of, evil, prophet, still, if, bird, or, devil, whether, tempter, sent, or, whether, tempest, tossed, thee, here, ashore, desolate, yet, all, undaunted, on, this, desert, land, enchanted, on, this, home, by, horror, haunted, tell, me, truly, i, implore, is, there, is, there, balm, in, gilead, tell, me, tell, me, i, implore, quoth, the, raven, nevermore, prophet, said, i, thing, of, evil, prophet, still, if, bird, or, devil, by, that, heaven, that, bends, above, us, by, that, god, we, both, adore, tell, this, soul, with, sorrow, laden, if, within, the, distant, aidenn, it, shall, clasp, a, sainted, maiden, whom, the, angels, name, lenore, clasp, a, rare, and, radiant, maiden, whom, the, angels, name, lenore, quoth, the, raven, nevermore, be, that, word, our, sign, of, parting, bird, or, fiend, i, shrieked, upstarting, get, thee, back, into, the, tempest, and, the, night, s, plutonian, shore, leave, no, black, plume, as, a, token, of, that, lie, thy, soul, hath, spoken, leave, my, loneliness, unbroken, quit, the, bust, above, my, door, take, thy, beak, from, out, my, heart, and, take, thy, form, from, off, my, door, quoth, the, raven, nevermore, and, the, raven, never, flitting, still, is, sitting, still, is, sitting, on, the, pallid, bust, of, pallas, just, above, my, chamber, door, and, his, eyes, have, all, the, seeming, of, a, demon, s, that, is, dreaming, and, the, lamp, light, o, er, him, streaming, throws, his, shadow, on, the, floor, and, my, soul, from, out, that, shadow, that, lies, floating, on, the, floor, shall, be, lifted, nevermore, edgar, allan, poe, the, raven, follows, an, unnamed, narrator, on, a, dreary, night, in, december, who, sits, reading, forgotten, lore, by, the, remains, of, a, fire, as, a, way, to, forget, the, death, of, his, beloved, lenore, a, tapping, at, chamber, door, reveals, nothing, but, excites, his, soul, to, burning, the, tapping, is, repeated, slightly, louder, and, he, realizes, it, is, coming, from, his, window, when, he, goes, to, investigate, a, raven, flutters, into, his, chamber, paying, no, attention, to, the, man, the, raven, perches, on, a, bust, of, pallas, above, the, door, amused, by, the, raven, s, comically, serious, disposition, the, man, asks, that, the, bird, tell, him, its, name, the, raven, s, only, answer, is, nevermore, the, narrator, is, surprised, that, the, raven, can, talk, though, at, this, point, it, has, said, nothing, further, the, narrator, remarks, to, himself, that, his, friend, the, raven, will, soon, fly, out, of, his, life, just, as, other, friends, have, flown, before, along, with, his, previous, hopes, as, if, answering, the, raven, responds, again, with, nevermore, the, narrator, reasons, that, the, bird, learned, the, word, nevermore, from, some, unhappy, master, and, that, it, is, the, only, word, it, knows, even, so, the, narrator, pulls, his, chair, directly, in, front, of, the, raven, determined, to, learn, more, about, it, he, thinks, for, a, moment, in, silence, and, his, mind, wanders, back, to, his, lost, lenore, he, thinks, the, air, grows, denser, and, feels, the, presence, of, angels, and, wonders, if, god, is, sending, him, a, sign, that, he, is, to, forget, lenore, the, bird, again, replies, in, the, negative, suggesting, that, he, can, never, be, free, of, his, memories, the, narrator, becomes, angry, calling, the, raven, a, thing, of, evil, and, a, prophet, finally, he, asks, the, raven, whether, he, will, be, reunited, with, lenore, in, heaven, when, the, raven, responds, with, its, typical, nevermore, he, is, enraged, and, calling, the, bird, a, liar, commands, it, to, return, to, the, plutonian, shore, but, it, does, not, move, at, the, time, of, the, poem, s, narration, the, raven, still, is, sitting, on, the, bust, of, pallas, the, raven, casts, a, shadow, on, the, chamber, floor, and, the, despondent, narrator, laments, that, out, of, this, shadow, his, soul, shall, be, lifted, nevermore, poe, wrote, the, poem, as, a, narrative, without, intentional, allegory, or, didacticism, the, main, theme, of, the, poem, is, one, of, undying, devotion, the, narrator, experiences, a, perverse, conflict, between, desire, to, forget, and, desire, to, remember, he, seems, to, get, some, pleasure, from, focusing, on, loss, the, narrator, assumes, that, the, word, nevermore, is, the, raven, s, only, stock, and, store, and, yet, he, continues, to, ask, it, questions, knowing, what, the, answer, will, be, his, questions, then, are, purposely, self, deprecating, and, further, incite, his, feelings, of, loss, poe, leaves, it, unclear, whether, the, raven, actually, knows, what, it, is, saying, or, whether, it, really, intends, to, cause, a, reaction, in, the, poem, s, narrator, the, narrator, begins, as, weak, and, weary, becomes, regretful, and, grief, stricken, before, passing, into, a, frenzy, and, finally, madness, christopher, f, s, maligec, suggests, the, poem, is, a, type, of, elegiac, paraclausithyron, an, ancient, greek, and, roman, poetic, form, consisting, of, the, lament, of, an, excluded, locked, out, lover, at, the, sealed, door, of, his, beloved, poe, says, that, the, narrator, is, a, young, scholar, though, this, is, not, explicitly, stated, in, the, poem, it, is, mentioned, in, the, philosophy, of, composition, it, is, also, suggested, by, the, narrator, reading, books, of, lore, as, well, as, by, the, bust, of, pallas, athena, greek, goddess, of, wisdom, he, is, reading, in, the, late, night, hours, from, many, a, quaint, and, curious, volume, of, forgotten, lore, similar, to, the, studies, suggested, in, poe, s, short, story, ligeia, this, lore, may, be, about, the, occult, or, black, magic, this, is, also, emphasized, in, the, author, s, choice, to, set, the, poem, in, december, a, month, which, is, traditionally, associated, with, the, forces, of, darkness, the, use, of, the, raven, the, devil, bird, also, suggests, this, this, devil, image, is, emphasized, by, the, narrator, s, belief, that, the, raven, is, from, the, night, s, plutonian, shore, or, a, messenger, from, the, afterlife, referring, to, pluto, the, roman, god, of, the, underworld, poe, chose, a, raven, as, the, central, symbol, in, the, story, because, he, wanted, a, non, reasoning, creature, capable, of, speech, he, decided, on, a, raven, which, he, considered, equally, capable, of, speech, as, a, parrot, because, it, matched, the, intended, tone, of, the, poem, poe, said, the, raven, is, meant, to, symbolize, mournful, and, never, ending, remembrance, he, was, also, inspired, by, grip, the, raven, in, barnaby, rudge, a, tale, of, the, riots, of, eighty, by, charles, dickens, one, scene, in, particular, bears, a, resemblance, to, the, raven, at, the, end, of, the, fifth, chapter, of, dickens, s, novel, grip, makes, a, noise, and, someone, says, what, was, that, him, tapping, at, the, door, the, response, is, tis, someone, knocking, softly, at, the, shutter, dickens, s, raven, could, speak, many, words, and, had, many, comic, turns, including, the, popping, of, a, champagne, cork, but, poe, emphasized, the, bird, s, more, dramatic, qualities, poe, had, written, a, review, of, barnaby, rudge, for, graham, s, magazine, saying, among, other, things, that, the, raven, should, have, served, a, more, symbolic, prophetic, purpose, the, similarity, did, not, go, unnoticed, james, russell, lowell, in, his, a, fable, for, critics, wrote, the, verse, here, comes, poe, with, his, raven, like, barnaby, rudge, three, fifths, of, him, genius, and, two, fifths, sheer, fudge, the, free, library, of, philadelphia, has, on, display, a, taxidermied, raven, that, is, reputed, to, be, the, very, one, that, dickens, owned, and, that, helped, inspire, poe, s, poem, poe, may, also, have, been, drawing, upon, various, references, to, ravens, in, mythology, and, folklore, in, norse, mythology, odin, possessed, two, ravens, named, huginn, and, muninn, representing, thought, and, memory, according, to, hebrew, folklore, noah, sends, a, white, raven, to, check, conditions, while, on, the, ark, it, learns, that, the, floodwaters, are, beginning, to, dissipate, but, it, does, not, immediately, return, with, the, news, it, is, punished, by, being, turned, black, and, being, forced, to, feed, on, carrion, forever, in, ovid, s, metamorphoses, a, raven, also, begins, as, white, before, apollo, punishes, it, by, turning, it, black, for, delivering, a, message, of, a, lover, s, unfaithfulness, the, raven, s, role, as, a, messenger, in, poe, s, poem, may, draw, from, those, stories, poe, mentions, the, balm, of, gilead, a, reference, to, the, book, of, jeremiah, 8, 22, in, the, bible, is, there, no, balm, in, gilead, is, there, no, physician, there, why, then, is, not, the, health, of, the, daughter, of, my, people, recovered, in, that, context, the, balm, of, gilead, is, a, resin, used, for, medicinal, purposes, suggesting, perhaps, that, the, narrator, needs, to, be, healed, after, the, loss, of, lenore, in, 1, kings, 17, 1, 5, elijah, is, said, to, be, from, gilead, and, to, have, been, fed, by, ravens, during, a, period, of, drought, the, poem, is, made, up, of, 18, stanzas, of, six, lines, each, generally, the, meter, is, trochaic, octameter, eight, trochaic, feet, per, line, each, foot, having, one, stressed, syllable, followed, by, one, unstressed, syllable, the, first, line, for, example, with, marking, stressed, syllables, and, marking, unstressed, poe, however, claimed, the, poem, was, a, combination, of, octameter, acatalectic, heptameter, catalectic, and, tetrameter, catalectic, the, rhyme, scheme, is, abcbbb, or, aa, b, cc, cb, b, b, when, accounting, for, internal, rhyme, in, every, stanza, the, b, lines, rhyme, with, the, word, nevermore, and, are, catalectic, placing, extra, emphasis, on, the, final, syllable, the, poem, also, makes, heavy, use, of, alliteration, doubting, dreaming, dreams, twentieth, century, american, poet, daniel, hoffman, suggested, that, the, poem, s, structure, and, meter, is, so, formulaic, that, it, is, artificial, though, its, mesmeric, quality, overrides, that, poe, based, the, structure, of, the, raven, on, the, complicated, rhyme, and, rhythm, of, elizabeth, barrett, s, poem, lady, geraldine, s, courtship, poe, had, reviewed, barrett, s, work, in, the, january, 1845, issue, of, the, broadway, journal, and, said, that, her, poetic, inspiration, is, the, highest, we, can, conceive, of, nothing, more, august, her, sense, of, art, is, pure, in, itself, as, is, typical, with, poe, his, review, also, criticizes, her, lack, of, originality, and, what, he, considers, the, repetitive, nature, of, some, of, her, poetry, about, lady, geraldine, s, courtship, he, said, i, have, never, read, a, poem, combining, so, much, of, the, fiercest, passion, with, so, much, of, the, most, delicate, imagination, poe, first, brought, the, raven, to, his, friend, and, former, employer, george, rex, graham, of, graham, s, magazine, in, philadelphia, graham, declined, the, poem, which, may, not, have, been, in, its, final, version, though, he, gave, poe, 15, equivalent, to, 491, in, 2023, as, charity, poe, then, sold, the, poem, to, the, american, review, which, paid, him, 9, equivalent, to, 294, in, 2023, for, it, and, printed, the, raven, in, its, february, 1845, issue, under, the, pseudonym, quarles, a, reference, to, the, english, poet, francis, quarles, the, poem, s, first, publication, with, poe, s, name, was, in, the, evening, mirror, on, january, 29, 1845, as, an, advance, copy, nathaniel, parker, willis, editor, of, the, mirror, introduced, it, as, unsurpassed, in, english, poetry, for, subtle, conception, masterly, ingenuity, of, versification, and, consistent, sustaining, of, imaginative, lift, it, will, stick, to, the, memory, of, everybody, who, reads, it, following, this, publication, the, poem, appeared, in, periodicals, across, the, united, states, including, the, new, york, tribune, february, 4, 1845, broadway, journal,

altered, without, his, permission, as, they, made, the, rounds, of, the, press, later, publications, of, the, raven, included, artwork, by, well, known, illustrators, notably, in, 1858, the, raven,

raven, by, following, it, up, with, his, essay, the, philosophy, of, composition, 1846, in, which, he, detailed, the, poem, s, creation, his, description, of, its, writing, is, probably, exaggerated, though, the, essay, serves, as, an, important, overview, of, poe, s, literary, theory, he, explains, that, every, component, of, the, poem, is, based, on, logic, the, raven, enters, the, chamber, to, avoid, a, storm, the, midnight, dreary, in, the, bleak, december, and, its, perch, on, a, pallid, white, bust, was, to, create, visual, contrast, against, the, dark, black, bird, no, aspect, of, the, poem, was, an, accident, he, claims, but, is, based, on, total, control, by, the, author, even, the, term, nevermore, he, says, is, used, because, of, the, effect, created, by, the, long, vowel, sounds, though, poe, may, have, been, inspired, to, use, the, word, by, the, works, of, lord, byron, or, henry, wadsworth, longfellow, poe, had, experimented, with, the, long, o, sound, throughout, many, other, poems, no, more, in, silence, evermore, in, the, conqueror, worm, the, topic, itself, poe, says, was, chosen, because, the, death, of, a, beautiful, woman, is, unquestionably, the, most, poetical, topic, in, the, world, told, from, the, lips, of, a, bereaved, lover, is, best, suited, to, achieve, the, desired, effect, beyond, the, poetics, of, it, the, lost, lenore, may, have, been, inspired, by, events, in, poe, s, own, life, as, well, either, to, the, early, loss, of, his, mother, eliza, poe, or, the, long, illness, endured, by, his, wife, virginia, ultimately, poe, considered, the, raven, an, experiment, to, suit, at, once, the, popular, and, critical, taste, accessible, to, both, the, mainstream, and, high, literary, worlds, it, is, unknown, how, long, poe, worked, on, the, raven, speculation, ranges, from, a, single, day, to, ten, years, poe, recited, a, poem, believed, to, be, an, early, version, with, an, alternate, ending, of, the, raven, in, 1843, in, saratoga, new, york, an, early, draft, may, have, featured, an, owl, in, the, summer, of, 1844, when, the, poem, was, likely, written, poe, his, wife, and, mother, in, law, were, boarding, at, the, farmhouse, of, patrick, brennan, the, location, of, the, house, which, was, demolished, in, 1888, has, been, a, disputed, point, and, while, there, are, two, different, plaques, marking, its, supposed, location, on, west, 84th, street, it, most, likely, stood, where, 206, west, 84th, street, is, now, in, part, due, to, its, dual, printing, the, raven, made, edgar, allan, poe, a, household, name, almost, immediately, and, turned, poe, into, a, national, celebrity, readers, began, to, identify, poem, with, poet, earning, poe, the, nickname, the, raven, the, poem, was, soon, widely, reprinted, imitated,
