and, dominant, harmonies, in, addition, to, pitch, tendencies, lullabies, share, several, structural, similarities, the, most, frequent, tendencies, are, intermittent, repetitions, and, long, pauses,

of, the, child, in, a, cradle, this, is, reflected, in, the, swinging, rhythmicity, of, the, music, in, addition, to, serving, as, a, cultural, symbol, of, the, infant, s, familial, status, the,

tradition, the, repetition, of, nonsense, syllables, the, creation, of, a, warm, affective, space, and, the, allusions, to, ancient, customs, and, beliefs, on, the, other, hand, these, lullabies, lacked, the, counting, elements, found, in, other, traditions, and, defined, safety, as, a, spiritual, space, while, danger, was, conceptualised, as, both, physical, and, spiritual, studies,

kind, of, therapy, leave, the, hospital, sooner, additional, research, by, jayne, m, standley, has, demonstrated, that, the, physiological, responses, of, prematurely, delivered, infants, undergoing, intensive, care, can, be, regulated, by, listening, to, gentle, lullabies, through, headphones, in, addition, to, slowing, heart, and, respiration, rates, lullabies, have, been, associated, with, increased, oxygen, saturation, levels, and, the, possible, prevention, of, potentially, life, threatening, episodes, of, apnea, and, bradycardia, gentle, music, can, also, provide, stimulation, for,

increasing, nipple, sucking, feeding, rates, providing, infants, with, the, nutrition, they, require, for, growth, and, development, lullabies, are, thus, associated, with, encouraging, the, rapid, development, of, the, neurological, system, and, with, a, shorter, length, of, hospitalization, more, recent, research, has, shown, that, lullabies, sung, live, can, have, beneficial, effects, on, physiological, functioning, and, development, in, premature, infants, the, live, element, of, a, slow, repetitive, entrained, rhythm, can, regulate, sucking, behavior, infants, have, a, natural, tendency, to, entrain, to, the, sounds, that, surround, them, beat, perception, begins, during, fetal, development, in, the, womb, and, infants, are, born, with, an, innate, musical, preference, the, element, of, live, breathing, sounds, can, regulate, infant, heart, rate, quiet, alert, states, and, sleep, live, lullabies, can, also, enhance, parent, child, bonding, thus, decreasing, parental,

infants, engage, in, a, bonding, activity, that, actually, alters, the, underlying, neural, structure, of, the, infant, brain, such, that, the, infant, becomes, tuned, into, music, and, its, association, with, parental, affiliation, 217, in, one, taiwanese, study, of, kangaroo, care, a, technique, practiced, on, newborn, infants, in, which, a, mother, holds, her, child, tightly, against, her, chest, it, was, demonstrated, that, infant, mother, dyads, who, listened, to, their, choice, of, lullaby, were, associated, with, more, quiet, sleep, states, and, less, occurrence, of, crying, by, the, infant, and, were, also, associated, with, significantly, lower, maternal, anxiety, than, those, dyads, who, did, not, listen, to, lullabies, the, therapeutic, effect, of, lullabies, can,
