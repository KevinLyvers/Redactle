the, king, james, version, kjv, also, the, king, james, bible, kjb, and, the, authorized, version, av, is, an, early, modern, english, translation, of, the, christian, bible, for, the, church, of, england, which, was, commissioned, in, 1604, and, published, in, 1611, by, sponsorship, of, king, james, vi, and, i, the, 80, books, of, the, king, james, version, include, 39, books, of, the, old, testament, 14, books, of, apocrypha, and, the, 27, books, of, the, new, testament, noted, for, its, majesty, of, style, the, king, james, version, has, been, described, as, one, of, the, most, important, books, in, english, culture, and, a, driving, force, in, the, shaping, of, the, english, speaking, world, the, king, james, version, remains, the, preferred, translation, of, many, christian, fundamentalists, and, religious, movements, and, it, is, considered, one, of, the, important, literary, accomplishments, of, early, modern, england, the, kjv, was, the, third, translation, into, english, approved, by, the, english, church, authorities, the, first, had, been, the, great, bible, 1535, and, the, second, had, been, the, bishops, bible, 1568, in, switzerland, the, first, generation, of, protestant, reformers, had, produced, the, geneva, bible, which, was, published, in, 1560, having, referred, to, the, original, hebrew, and, greek, scriptures, which, was, influential, in, the, writing, of, the, authorized, king, james, version, the, english, church, initially, used, the, officially, sanctioned, bishops, bible, which, was, hardly, used, by, the, population, more, popular, was, the, named, geneva, bible, which, was, created, on, the, basis, of, the, tyndale, translation, in, geneva, under, the, direct, successor, of, the, reformer, john, calvin, for, his, english, followers, however, their, footnotes, represented, a, calvinistic, puritanism, that, was, too, radical, for, james, the, translators, of, the, geneva, bible, had, translated, the, word, king, as, tyrant, about, four, hundred, times, the, word, tyrant, does, not, appear, once, in, the, kjv, because, of, this, it, has, been, assumed, king, james, purposely, had, the, translators, of, the, kjv, translate, the, word, tyrant, as, either, troubling, oppressor, or, some, other, word, to, avoid, people, being, critical, of, his, monarchy, james, convened, the, hampton, court, conference, in, january, 1604, where, a, new, english, version, was, conceived, in, response, to, the, problems, of, the, earlier, translations, perceived, by, the, puritans, a, faction, of, the, church, of, england, james, gave, translators, instructions, intended, to, ensure, the, new, version, would, conform, to, the, ecclesiology, and, reflect, the, episcopal, structure, of, the, church, of, england, and, its, belief, in, an, ordained, clergy, in, common, with, most, other, translations, of, the, period, the, new, testament, was, translated, from, greek, the, old, testament, from, hebrew, and, aramaic, and, the, apocrypha, from, greek, and, latin, in, the, 1662, book, of, common, prayer, the, text, of, the, authorized, version, replaced, the, text, of, the, great, bible, for, epistle, and, gospel, readings, and, as, such, was, authorized, by, an, act, of, parliament, by, the, first, half, of, the, 18th, century, the, authorized, version, had, become, effectively, unchallenged, as, the, only, english, translation, used, in, anglican, and, other, english, protestant, churches, except, for, the, psalms, and, some, short, passages, in, the, book, of, common, prayer, of, the, church, of, england, over, the, 18th, century, the, authorized, version, supplanted, the, latin, vulgate, as, the, standard, version, of, scripture, for, english, speaking, scholars, with, the, development, of, stereotype, printing, at, the, beginning, of, the, 19th, century, this, version, of, the, bible, had, become, the, most, widely, printed, book, in, history, almost, all, such, printings, presenting, the, standard, text, of, 1769, and, nearly, always, omitting, the, books, of, the, apocrypha, today, the, unqualified, title, king, james, version, usually, indicates, this, oxford, standard, text, the, title, of, the, first, edition, of, the, translation, in, early, modern, english, was, the, holy, bible, conteyning, the, old, te, tament, and, the, new, newly, tran, lated, out, of, the, originall, tongues, with, the, former, tran, lations, diligently, compared, and, reui, ed, by, his, maiesties, peciall, c, mandement, the, title, page, carries, the, words, appointed, to, be, read, in, churches, and, f, f, bruce, suggests, it, was, probably, authorised, by, order, in, council, but, no, record, of, the, authorisation, survives, because, the, privy, council, registers, from, 1600, to, 1613, were, destroyed, by, fire, in, january, 1618, 19, for, many, years, it, was, common, not, to, give, the, translation, any, specific, name, in, his, leviathan, of, 1651, thomas, hobbes, referred, to, it, as, the, english, translation, made, in, the, beginning, of, the, reign, of, king, james, a, 1761, brief, account, of, the, various, translations, of, the, bible, into, english, refers, to, the, 1611, version, merely, as, a, new, compleat, and, more, accurate, translation, despite, referring, to, the, great, bible, by, its, name, and, despite, using, the, name, rhemish, testament, for, the, douay, rheims, bible, version, similarly, a, history, of, england, whose, fifth, edition, was, published, in, 1775, writes, merely, that, new, translation, of, the, bible, viz, that, now, in, use, was, begun, in, 1607, and, published, in, 1611, king, james, s, bible, is, used, as, the, name, for, the, 1611, translation, on, a, par, with, the, genevan, bible, or, the, rhemish, testament, in, charles, butler, s, horae, biblicae, first, published, 1797, other, works, from, the, early, 19th, century, confirm, the, widespread, use, of, this, name, on, both, sides, of, the, atlantic, it, is, found, both, in, a, historical, sketch, of, the, english, translations, of, the, bible, published, in, massachusetts, in, 1815, and, in, an, english, publication, from, 1818, which, explicitly, states, that, the, 1611, version, is, generally, known, by, the, name, of, king, james, s, bible, this, name, was, also, found, as, king, james, bible, without, the, final, s, for, example, in, a, book, review, from, 1811, the, phrase, king, james, s, bible, is, used, as, far, back, as, 1715, although, in, this, case, it, is, not, clear, whether, this, is, a, name, or, merely, a, description, the, use, of, authorized, version, capitalized, and, used, as, a, name, is, found, as, early, as, 1814, for, some, time, before, this, descriptive, phrases, such, as, our, present, and, only, publicly, authorised, version, 1783, our, authorized, version, 1731, 1792, and, the, authorized, version, 1801, uncapitalized, are, found, a, more, common, appellation, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, was, our, english, translation, or, our, english, version, as, can, be, seen, by, searching, one, or, other, of, the, major, online, archives, of, printed, books, in, britain, the, 1611, translation, is, generally, known, as, the, authorized, version, today, the, term, is, somewhat, of, a, misnomer, because, the, text, itself, was, never, formally, authorized, nor, were, english, parish, churches, ever, ordered, to, procure, copies, of, it, king, james, version, evidently, a, descriptive, phrase, is, found, being, used, as, early, as, 1814, the, king, james, version, is, found, unequivocally, used, as, a, name, in, a, letter, from, 1855, the, next, year, king, james, bible, with, no, possessive, appears, as, a, name, in, a, scottish, source, in, the, united, states, the, 1611, translation, actually, editions, following, the, standard, text, of, 1769, see, below, is, generally, known, as, the, king, james, version, today, the, followers, of, john, wycliffe, undertook, the, first, complete, english, translations, of, the, christian, scriptures, in, the, 14th, century, these, translations, were, banned, in, 1409, due, to, their, association, with, the, lollards, the, wycliffe, bible, pre, dated, the, printing, press, but, it, was, circulated, very, widely, in, manuscript, form, often, inscribed, with, a, date, which, was, earlier, than, 1409, in, order, to, avoid, the, legal, ban, because, the, text, of, the, various, versions, of, the, wycliffe, bible, was, translated, from, the, latin, vulgate, and, because, it, also, contained, no, heterodox, readings, the, ecclesiastical, authorities, had, no, practical, way, to, distinguish, the, banned, version, consequently, many, catholic, commentators, of, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, such, as, thomas, more, took, these, manuscripts, of, english, bibles, and, claimed, that, they, represented, an, anonymous, earlier, orthodox, translation, in, 1525, william, tyndale, an, english, contemporary, of, martin, luther, undertook, a, translation, of, the, new, testament, tyndale, s, translation, was, the, first, printed, bible, in, english, over, the, next, ten, years, tyndale, revised, his, new, testament, in, the, light, of, rapidly, advancing, biblical, scholarship, and, embarked, on, a, translation, of, the, old, testament, despite, some, controversial, translation, choices, and, in, spite, of, tyndale, s, execution, on, charges, of, heresy, for, having, made, the, translated, bible, the, merits, of, tyndale, s, work, and, prose, style, made, his, translation, the, ultimate, basis, for, all, subsequent, renditions, into, early, modern, english, with, these, translations, lightly, edited, and, adapted, by, myles, coverdale, in, 1539, tyndale, s, new, testament, and, his, incomplete, work, on, the, old, testament, became, the, basis, for, the, great, bible, this, was, the, first, authorised, version, issued, by, the, church, of, england, during, the, reign, of, king, henry, viii, when, mary, i, succeeded, to, the, throne, in, 1553, she, returned, the, church, of, england, to, the, communion, of, the, catholic, faith, and, many, english, religious, reformers, fled, the, country, some, establishing, an, english, speaking, community, in, the, protestant, city, of, geneva, under, the, leadership, of, john, calvin, geneva, became, the, chief, international, centre, of, reformed, protestantism, and, latin, biblical, scholarship, these, english, expatriates, undertook, a, translation, that, became, known, as, the, geneva, bible, this, translation, dated, to, 1560, was, a, revision, of, tyndale, s, bible, and, the, great, bible, on, the, basis, of, the, original, languages, soon, after, elizabeth, i, took, the, throne, in, 1558, problems, with, both, the, great, and, geneva, bibles, namely, that, the, latter, did, not, conform, to, the, ecclesiology, and, reflect, the, episcopal, structure, of, the, church, of, england, and, its, beliefs, about, an, ordained, clergy, became, apparent, to, church, authorities, in, 1568, the, church, of, england, responded, with, the, bishops, bible, a, revision, of, the, great, bible, in, the, light, of, the, geneva, version, while, officially, approved, this, new, version, failed, to, displace, the, geneva, translation, as, the, most, popular, english, bible, of, the, age, in, part, because, the, full, bible, was, printed, only, in, lectern, editions, of, prodigious, size, and, at, a, cost, of, several, pounds, accordingly, elizabethan, lay, people, overwhelmingly, read, the, bible, in, the, geneva, version, as, small, editions, were, available, at, a, relatively, low, cost, at, the, same, time, there, was, a, substantial, clandestine, importation, of, the, rival, douay, rheims, new, testament, of, 1582, undertaken, by, exiled, catholics, this, translation, though, still, derived, from, tyndale, claimed, to, represent, the, text, of, the, latin, vulgate, in, may, 1601, king, james, vi, of, scotland, attended, the, general, assembly, of, the, church, of, scotland, at, saint, columba, s, church, in, burntisland, fife, at, which, proposals, were, put, forward, for, a, new, translation, of, the, bible, into, english, two, years, later, he, ascended, to, the, throne, of, england, as, james, i, the, newly, crowned, king, james, convened, the, hampton, court, conference, in, 1604, that, gathering, proposed, a, new, english, version, in, response, to, the, perceived, problems, of, earlier, translations, as, detected, by, the, puritan, faction, of, the, church, of, england, here, are, three, examples, of, problems, the, puritans, perceived, with, the, bishops, and, great, bibles, first, galatians, iv, 25, from, the, bishops, bible, the, greek, word, susoichei, is, not, well, translated, as, now, it, is, bordereth, neither, expressing, the, force, of, the, word, nor, the, apostle, s, sense, nor, the, situation, of, the, place, secondly, psalm, cv, 28, from, the, great, bible, they, were, not, obedient, the, original, being, they, were, not, disobedient, thirdly, psalm, cvi, 30, also, from, the, great, bible, then, stood, up, phinees, and, prayed, the, hebrew, hath, executed, judgment, instructions, were, given, to, the, translators, that, were, intended, to, use, formal, equivalence, and, limit, the, puritan, influence, on, this, new, translation, the, bishop, of, london, added, a, qualification, that, the, translators, would, add, no, marginal, notes, which, had, been, an, issue, in, the, geneva, bible, king, james, cited, two, passages, in, the, geneva, translation, where, he, found, the, marginal, notes, offensive, to, the, principles, of, divinely, ordained, royal, supremacy, exodus, 1, 19, where, the, geneva, bible, notes, had, commended, the, example, of, civil, disobedience, to, the, egyptian, pharaoh, showed, by, the, hebrew, midwives, and, also, ii, chronicles, 15, 16, where, the, geneva, bible, had, criticized, king, asa, for, not, having, executed, his, idolatrous, mother, queen, maachah, maachah, had, actually, been, asa, s, grandmother, but, james, considered, the, geneva, bible, reference, as, sanctioning, the, execution, of, his, own, mother, mary, queen, of, scots, further, the, king, gave, the, translators, instructions, designed, to, guarantee, that, the, new, version, would, conform, to, the, ecclesiology, of, the, church, of, england, certain, greek, and, hebrew, words, were, to, be, translated, in, a, manner, that, reflected, the, traditional, usage, of, the, church, for, example, old, ecclesiastical, words, such, as, the, word, church, were, to, be, retained, and, not, to, be, translated, as, congregation, the, new, translation, would, reflect, the, episcopal, structure, of, the, church, of, england, and, traditional, beliefs, about, ordained, clergy, the, source, material, for, the, translation, of, the, new, testament, was, the, textus, receptus, version, of, the, greek, compiled, by, erasmus, for, the, old, testament, the, masoretic, text, of, the, hebrew, was, used, for, some, of, the, apocrypha, the, septuagint, greek, text, was, used, or, for, apocrypha, for, which, the, greek, was, unavailable, the, vulgate, latin, james, instructions, included, several, requirements, that, kept, the, new, translation, familiar, to, its, listeners, and, readers, the, text, of, the, bishops, bible, would, serve, as, the, primary, guide, for, the, translators, and, the, familiar, proper, names, of, the, biblical, characters, would, all, be, retained, if, the, bishops, bible, was, deemed, problematic, in, any, situation, the, translators, were, permitted, to, consult, other, translations, from, a, pre, approved, list, the, tyndale, bible, the, coverdale, bible, matthew, s, bible, the, great, bible, and, the, geneva, bible, in, addition, later, scholars, have, detected, an, influence, on, the, authorized, version, from, the, translations, of, taverner, s, bible, and, the, new, testament, of, the, douay, rheims, bible, it, is, for, this, reason, that, the, flyleaf, of, most, printings, of, the, authorized, version, observes, that, the, text, had, been, translated, out, of, the, original, tongues, and, with, the, former, translations, diligently, compared, and, revised, by, his, majesty, s, special, commandment, as, the, work, proceeded, more, detailed, rules, were, adopted, as, to, how, variant, and, uncertain, readings, in, the, hebrew, and, greek, source, texts, should, be, indicated, including, the, requirement, that, words, supplied, in, english, to, complete, the, meaning, of, the, originals, should, be, printed, in, a, different, type, face, the, task, of, translation, was, undertaken, by, 47, scholars, although, 54, were, originally, approved, all, were, members, of, the, church, of, england, and, all, except, sir, henry, savile, were, clergy, the, scholars, worked, in, six, committees, two, based, in, each, of, the, university, of, oxford, the, university, of, cambridge, and, westminster, the, committees, included, scholars, with, puritan, sympathies, as, well, as, high, churchmen, forty, unbound, copies, of, the, 1602, edition, of, the, bishops, bible, were, specially, printed, so, that, the, agreed, changes, of, each, committee, could, be, recorded, in, the, margins, the, committees, worked, on, certain, parts, separately, and, the, drafts, produced, by, each, committee, were, then, compared, and, revised, for, harmony, with, each, other, the, scholars, were, not, paid, directly, for, their, translation, work, instead, a, circular, letter, was, sent, to, bishops, encouraging, them, to, consider, the, translators, for, appointment, to, well, paid, livings, as, these, fell, vacant, several, were, supported, by, the, various, colleges, at, oxford, and, cambridge, while, others, were, promoted, to, bishoprics, deaneries, and, prebends, through, royal, patronage, on, 22, july, 1604, king, james, vi, and, i, sent, a, letter, to, archbishop, bancroft, asking, him, to, contact, all, english, churchmen, requesting, that, they, make, donations, to, his, project, right, trusty, and, well, beloved, we, greet, you, well, whereas, we, have, appointed, certain, learned, men, to, the, number, of, 4, and, 50, for, the, translating, of, the, bible, and, in, this, number, divers, of, them, have, either, no, ecclesiastical, preferment, at, all, or, else, so, very, small, as, the, same, is, far, unmeet, for, men, of, their, deserts, and, yet, we, in, ourself, in, any, convenient, time, cannot, well, remedy, it, therefor, we, do, hereby, require, you, that, presently, you, write, in, our, name, as, well, to, the, archbishop, of, york, as, to, the, rest, of, the, bishops, of, the, province, of, cant, signifying, unto, them, that, we, do, well, and, straitly, charge, everyone, of, them, that, all, excuses, set, apart, when, a, prebend, or, parsonage, shall, next, upon, any, occasion, happen, to, be, void, we, may, commend, for, the, same, some, such, of, the, learned, men, as, we, shall, think, fit, to, be, preferred, unto, it, given, unto, our, signet, at, our, palace, of, west, on, 2, and, 20, july, in, the, 2nd, year, of, our, reign, of, england, france, and, of, ireland, and, of, scotland, xxxvii, the, six, committees, started, work, towards, the, end, of, 1604, the, apocrypha, committee, finishing, first, and, all, six, completed, their, sections, by, 1608, from, january, 1609, a, general, committee, of, review, met, at, stationers, hall, london, to, review, the, completed, marked, texts, from, each, of, the, committees, and, were, paid, for, their, attendance, by, the, stationers, company, the, general, committee, included, john, bois, andrew, downes, john, harmar, and, others, known, only, by, their, initials, including, al, who, may, be, arthur, lake, john, bois, prepared, a, note, of, their, deliberations, in, latin, which, has, partly, survived, in, two, later, transcripts, also, surviving, of, the, translators, working, papers, are, a, bound, set, of, marked, up, corrections, to, one, of, the, forty, bishops, bibles, covering, the, old, testament, and, gospels, and, also, a, manuscript, translation, of, the, text, of, the, epistles, excepting, those, verses, where, no, change, was, being, recommended, to, the, readings, in, the, bishops, bible, archbishop, bancroft, insisted, on, having, a, final, say, making, fourteen, further, changes, of, which, one, was, the, term, bishopricke, at, acts, 1, 20, the, original, printing, of, the, authorized, version, was, published, by, robert, barker, the, king, s, printer, in, 1611, as, a, complete, folio, bible, it, was, sold, looseleaf, for, ten, shillings, or, bound, for, twelve, robert, barker, s, father, christopher, had, in, 1589, been, granted, by, elizabeth, i, the, title, of, royal, printer, with, the, perpetual, royal, privilege, to, print, bibles, in, england, robert, barker, invested, very, large, sums, in, printing, the, new, edition, and, consequently, ran, into, serious, debt, such, that, he, was, compelled, to, sub, lease, the, privilege, to, two, rival, london, printers, bonham, norton, and, john, bill, it, appears, that, it, was, initially, intended, that, each, printer, would, print, a, portion, of, the, text, share, printed, sheets, with, the, others, and, split, the, proceeds, bitter, financial, disputes, broke, out, as, barker, accused, norton, and, bill, of, concealing, their, profits, while, norton, and, bill, accused, barker, of, selling, sheets, properly, due, to, them, as, partial, bibles, for, ready, money, there, followed, decades, of, continual, litigation, and, consequent, imprisonment, for, debt, for, members, of, the, barker, and, norton, printing, dynasties, while, each, issued, rival, editions, of, the, whole, bible, in, 1629, the, universities, of, oxford, and, cambridge, successfully, managed, to, assert, separate, and, prior, royal, licences, for, bible, printing, for, their, own, university, presses, and, cambridge, university, took, the, opportunity, to, print, revised, editions, of, the, authorized, version, in, 1629, and, 1638, the, editors, of, these, editions, included, john, bois, and, john, ward, from, the, original, translators, this, did, not, however, impede, the, commercial, rivalries, of, the, london, printers, especially, as, the, barker, family, refused, to, allow, any, other, printers, access, to, the, authoritative, manuscript, of, the, authorized, version, two, editions, of, the, whole, bible, are, recognized, as, having, been, produced, in, 1611, which, may, be, distinguished, by, their, rendering, of, ruth, 3, 15, the, first, edition, reading, he, went, into, the, city, where, the, second, reads, she, went, into, the, city, these, are, known, colloquially, as, the, he, and, she, bibles, the, original, printing, was, made, before, english, spelling, was, standardized, and, when, printers, as, a, matter, of, course, expanded, and, contracted, the, spelling, of, the, same, words, in, different, places, so, as, to, achieve, an, even, column, of, text, they, set, v, for, initial, u, and, v, and, u, for, u, and, v, everywhere, else, they, used, the, long, s, for, non, final, s, the, letter, or, glyph, j, occurs, only, after, i, as, in, the, final, letter, in, a, roman, numeral, such, as, xiij, punctuation, was, relatively, heavy, frequent, and, differed, from, modern, practice, when, space, needed, to, be, saved, the, printers, sometimes, used, ye, for, the, replacing, the, middle, english, thorn, with, the, continental, y, set, for, an, or, am, in, the, style, of, scribe, s, shorthand, and, set, for, and, in, contrast, on, a, few, occasions, they, appear, to, have, inserted, these, words, when, they, thought, a, line, needed, to, be, padded, later, printings, regularized, these, spellings, the, punctuation, has, also, been, standardized, but, still, varies, from, current, usage, as, can, be, seen, in, the, example, page, on, the, left, the, first, printing, used, a, blackletter, typeface, instead, of, a, roman, typeface, which, itself, made, a, political, and, a, religious, statement, like, the, great, bible, and, the, bishops, bible, the, authorized, version, was, appointed, to, be, read, in, churches, it, was, a, large, folio, volume, meant, for, public, use, not, private, devotion, the, weight, of, the, type, blackletter, type, was, heavy, physically, as, well, as, visually, mirrored, the, weight, of, establishment, authority, behind, it, however, smaller, editions, and, roman, type, editions, followed, rapidly, e, g, quarto, roman, type, editions, of, the, bible, in, 1612, this, contrasted, with, the, geneva, bible, which, was, the, first, english, bible, printed, in, a, roman, typeface, although, black, letter, editions, particularly, in, folio, format, were, issued, later, in, contrast, to, the, geneva, bible, and, the, bishops, bible, which, had, both, been, extensively, illustrated, there, were, no, illustrations, in, the, 1611, edition, of, the, authorized, version, the, main, form, of, decoration, being, the, historiated, initial, letters, provided, for, books, and, chapters, together, with, the, decorative, title, pages, to, the, bible, itself, and, to, the, new, testament, in, the, great, bible, readings, derived, from, the, vulgate, but, not, found, in, published, hebrew, and, greek, texts, had, been, distinguished, by, being, printed, in, smaller, roman, type, in, the, geneva, bible, a, distinct, typeface, had, instead, been, applied, to, distinguish, text, supplied, by, translators, or, thought, needful, for, english, grammar, but, not, present, in, the, greek, or, hebrew, and, the, original, printing, of, the, authorized, version, used, roman, type, for, this, purpose, albeit, sparsely, and, inconsistently, this, results, in, perhaps, the, most, significant, difference, between, the, original, printed, text, of, the, king, james, bible, and, the, current, text, when, from, the, later, 17th, century, onwards, the, authorized, version, began, to, be, printed, in, roman, type, the, typeface, for, supplied, words, was, changed, to, italics, this, application, being, regularized, and, greatly, expanded, this, was, intended, to, de, emphasize, the, words, the, original, printing, contained, two, prefatory, texts, the, first, was, a, formal, epistle, dedicatory, to, the, most, high, and, mighty, prince, king, james, many, british, printings, reproduce, this, while, most, non, british, printings, do, not, the, second, preface, was, called, translators, to, the, reader, a, long, and, learned, essay, that, defends, the, undertaking, of, the, new, version, it, observes, the, translators, stated, goal, that, they, never, thought, from, the, beginning, that, should, need, to, make, a, new, translation, nor, yet, to, make, of, a, bad, one, a, good, one, but, to, make, a, good, one, better, or, out, of, many, good, ones, one, principal, good, one, not, justly, to, be, excepted, against, that, hath, been, our, endeavour, that, our, mark, they, also, give, their, opinion, of, previous, english, bible, translations, stating, we, do, not, deny, nay, we, affirm, and, avow, that, the, very, meanest, translation, of, the, bible, in, english, set, forth, by, men, of, our, profession, for, we, have, seen, none, of, theirs, of, the, whole, bible, as, yet, containeth, the, word, of, god, nay, is, the, word, of, god, as, with, the, first, preface, some, british, printings, reproduce, this, while, most, non, british, printings, do, not, almost, every, printing, that, includes, the, second, preface, also, includes, the, first, the, first, printing, contained, a, number, of, other, apparatus, including, a, table, for, the, reading, of, the, psalms, at, matins, and, evensong, and, a, calendar, an, almanac, and, a, table, of, holy, days, and, observances, much, of, this, material, became, obsolete, with, the, adoption, of, the, gregorian, calendar, by, britain, and, its, colonies, in, 1752, and, thus, modern, editions, invariably, omit, it, so, as, to, make, it, easier, to, know, a, particular, passage, each, chapter, was, headed, by, a, brief, pr, cis, of, its, contents, with, verse, numbers, later, editors, freely, substituted, their, own, chapter, summaries, or, omitted, such, material, entirely, pilcrow, marks, are, used, to, indicate, the, beginnings, of, paragraphs, except, after, the, book, of, acts, the, authorized, version, was, meant, to, replace, the, bishops, bible, as, the, official, version, for, readings, in, the, church, of, england, no, record, of, its, authorization, exists, it, was, probably, effected, by, an, order, of, the, privy, council, but, the, records, for, the, years, 1600, to, 1613, were, destroyed, by, fire, in, january, 1618, 19, and, it, is, commonly, known, as, the, authorized, version, in, the, united, kingdom, the, king, s, printer, issued, no, further, editions, of, the, bishops, bible, so, necessarily, the, authorized, version, replaced, it, as, the, standard, lectern, bible, in, parish, church, use, in, england, in, the, 1662, book, of, common, prayer, the, text, of, the, authorized, version, finally, supplanted, that, of, the, great, bible, in, the, epistle, and, gospel, readings, though, the, prayer, book, psalter, nevertheless, continues, in, the, great, bible, version, the, case, was, different, in, scotland, where, the, geneva, bible, had, long, been, the, standard, church, bible, it, was, not, until, 1633, that, a, scottish, edition, of, the, authorized, version, was, printed, in, conjunction, with, the, scots, coronation, in, that, year, of, charles, i, the, inclusion, of, illustrations, in, the, edition, raised, accusations, of, popery, from, opponents, of, the, religious, policies, of, charles, and, william, laud, archbishop, of, canterbury, however, official, policy, favoured, the, authorized, version, and, this, favour, returned, during, the, commonwealth, as, london, printers, succeeded, in, re, asserting, their, monopoly, on, bible, printing, with, support, from, oliver, cromwell, and, the, new, translation, was, the, only, edition, on, the, market, f, f, bruce, reports, that, the, last, recorded, instance, of, a, scots, parish, continuing, to, use, the, old, translation, i, e, geneva, as, being, in, 1674, the, authorized, version, s, acceptance, by, the, general, public, took, longer, the, geneva, bible, continued, to, be, popular, and, large, numbers, were, imported, from, amsterdam, where, printing, continued, up, to, 1644, in, editions, carrying, a, false, london, imprint, however, few, if, any, genuine, geneva, editions, appear, to, have, been, printed, in, london, after, 1616, and, in, 1637, archbishop, laud, prohibited, their, printing, or, importation, in, the, period, of, the, english, civil, war, soldiers, of, the, new, model, army, were, issued, a, book, of, geneva, selections, called, the, soldiers, bible, in, the, first, half, of, the, 17th, century, the, authorized, version, is, most, commonly, referred, to, as, the, bible, without, notes, thereby, distinguishing, it, from, the, geneva, bible, with, notes, there, were, several, printings, of, the, authorized, version, in, amsterdam, one, as, late, as, 1715, which, combined, the, authorized, version, translation, text, with, the, geneva, marginal, notes, one, such, edition, was, printed, in, london, in, 1649, during, the, commonwealth, a, commission, was, established, by, parliament, to, recommend, a, revision, of, the, authorized, version, with, acceptably, protestant, explanatory, notes, but, the, project, was, abandoned, when, it, became, clear, that, these, would, nearly, double, the, bulk, of, the, bible, text, after, the, english, restoration, the, geneva, bible, was, held, to, be, politically, suspect, and, a, reminder, of, the, repudiated, puritan, era, furthermore, disputes, over, the, lucrative, rights, to, print, the, authorized, version, dragged, on, through, the, 17th, century, so, none, of, the, printers, involved, saw, any, commercial, advantage, in, marketing, a, rival, translation, the, authorized, version, became, the, only, then, current, version, circulating, among, english, speaking, people, a, small, minority, of, critical, scholars, were, slow, to, accept, the, latest, translation, hugh, broughton, who, was, the, most, highly, regarded, english, hebraist, of, his, time, but, had, been, excluded, from, the, panel, of, translators, because, of, his, utterly, uncongenial, temperament, issued, in, 1611, a, total, condemnation, of, the, new, version, he, especially, criticized, the, translators, rejection, of, word, for, word, equivalence, and, stated, that, he, would, rather, be, torn, in, pieces, by, wild, horses, than, that, this, abominable, translation, kjv, should, ever, be, foisted, upon, the, english, people, walton, s, london, polyglot, of, 1657, disregards, the, authorized, version, and, indeed, the, english, language, entirely, walton, s, reference, text, throughout, is, the, vulgate, the, vulgate, latin, is, also, found, as, the, standard, text, of, scripture, in, thomas, hobbes, s, leviathan, of, 1651, hobbes, gives, vulgate, chapter, and, verse, numbers, e, g, job, 41, 24, not, job, 41, 33, for, his, head, text, in, chapter, 35, the, signification, in, scripture, of, kingdom, of, god, hobbes, discusses, exodus, 19, 5, first, in, his, own, translation, of, the, vulgar, latin, and, then, subsequently, as, found, in, the, versions, he, terms, the, english, translation, made, in, the, beginning, of, the, reign, of, king, james, and, the, geneva, french, i, e, oliv, tan, hobbes, advances, detailed, critical, arguments, why, the, vulgate, rendering, is, to, be, preferred, for, most, of, the, 17th, century, the, assumption, remained, that, while, it, had, been, of, vital, importance, to, provide, the, scriptures, in, the, vernacular, for, ordinary, people, nevertheless, for, those, with, sufficient, education, to, do, so, biblical, study, was, best, undertaken, within, the, international, common, medium, of, latin, it, was, only, in, 1700, that, modern, bilingual, bibles, appeared, in, which, the, authorized, version, was, compared, with, counterpart, dutch, and, french, protestant, vernacular, bibles, in, consequence, of, the, continual, disputes, over, printing, privileges, successive, printings, of, the, authorized, version, were, notably, less, careful, than, the, 1611, edition, had, been, compositors, freely, varying, spelling, capitalization, and, punctuation, and, also, over, the, years, introducing, about, 1, 500, misprints, some, of, which, like, the, omission, of, not, from, the, commandment, thou, shalt, not, commit, adultery, in, the, wicked, bible, became, notorious, the, two, cambridge, editions, of, 1629, and, 1638, attempted, to, restore, the, proper, text, while, introducing, over, 200, revisions, of, the, original, translators, work, chiefly, by, incorporating, into, the, main, text, a, more, literal, reading, originally, presented, as, a, marginal, note, a, more, thoroughly, corrected, edition, was, proposed, following, the, restoration, in, conjunction, with, the, revised, 1662, book, of, common, prayer, but, parliament, then, decided, against, it, by, the, first, half, of, the, 18th, century, the, authorized, version, was, effectively, unchallenged, as, the, sole, english, translation, in, then, current, use, in, protestant, churches, and, was, so, dominant, that, the, catholic, church, in, england, issued, in, 1750, a, revision, of, the, 1610, douay, rheims, bible, by, richard, challoner, that, was, much, closer, to, the, authorized, version, than, to, the, original, however, general, standards, of, spelling, punctuation, typesetting, capitalization, and, grammar, had, changed, radically, in, the, 100, years, since, the, first, edition, of, the, authorized, version, and, all, printers, in, the, market, were, introducing, continual, piecemeal, changes, to, their, bible, texts, to, bring, them, into, line, with, then, current, practice, and, with, public, expectations, of, standardized, spelling, and, grammatical, construction, over, the, course, of, the, 18th, century, the, authorized, version, supplanted, the, hebrew, greek, and, the, latin, vulgate, as, the, standard, version, of, scripture, for, english, speaking, scholars, and, divines, and, indeed, came, to, be, regarded, by, some, as, an, inspired, text, in, itself, so, much, so, that, any, challenge, to, its, readings, or, textual, base, came, to, be, regarded, by, many, as, an, assault, on, holy, scripture, in, the, 18th, century, there, was, a, serious, shortage, of, bibles, in, the, american, colonies, to, meet, the, demand, various, printers, beginning, with, samuel, kneeland, in, 1752, printed, the, king, james, bible, without, authorization, from, the, crown, to, avert, prosecution, and, detection, of, an, unauthorized, printing, they, would, include, the, royal, insignia, on, the, title, page, using, the, same, materials, in, its, printing, as, the, authorized, version, was, produced, from, which, were, imported, from, england, by, the, mid, 18th, century, the, wide, variation, in, the, various, modernized, printed, texts, of, the, authorized, version, combined, with, the, notorious, accumulation, of, misprints, had, reached, the, proportion, of, a, scandal, and, the, universities, of, oxford, and, cambridge, both, sought, to, produce, an, updated, standard, text, first, of, the, two, was, the, cambridge, edition, of, 1760, the, culmination, of, 20, years, work, by, francis, sawyer, parris, who, died, in, may, of, that, year, this, 1760, edition, was, reprinted, without, change, in, 1762, and, in, john, baskerville, s, folio, edition, of, 1763, this, was, effectively, superseded, by, the, 1769, oxford, edition, edited, by, benjamin, blayney, though, with, comparatively, few, changes, from, parris, s, edition, but, which, became, the, oxford, standard, text, and, is, reproduced, almost, unchanged, in, most, current, printings, parris, and, blayney, sought, consistently, to, remove, those, elements, of, the, 1611, and, subsequent, editions, that, they, believed, were, due, to, the, vagaries, of, printers, while, incorporating, most, of, the, revised, readings, of, the, cambridge, editions, of, 1629, and, 1638, and, each, also, introducing, a, few, improved, readings, of, their, own, they, undertook, the, mammoth, task, of, standardizing, the, wide, variation, in, punctuation, and, spelling, of, the, original, making, many, thousands, of, minor, changes, to, the, text, in, addition, blayney, and, parris, thoroughly, revised, and, greatly, extended, the, italicization, of, supplied, words, not, found, in, the, original, languages, by, cross, checking, against, the, presumed, source, texts, blayney, seems, to, have, worked, from, the, 1550, stephanus, edition, of, the, textus, receptus, rather, than, the, later, editions, of, theodore, beza, that, the, translators, of, the, 1611, new, testament, had, favoured, accordingly, the, current, oxford, standard, text, alters, around, a, dozen, italicizations, where, beza, and, stephanus, differ, like, the, 1611, edition, the, 1769, oxford, edition, included, the, apocrypha, although, blayney, tended, to, remove, cross, references, to, the, books, of, the, apocrypha, from, the, margins, of, their, old, and, new, testaments, wherever, these, had, been, provided, by, the, original, translators, it, also, includes, both, prefaces, from, the, 1611, edition, altogether, the, standardization, of, spelling, and, punctuation, caused, blayney, s, 1769, text, to, differ, from, the, 1611, text, in, around, 24, 000, places, the, 1611, and, 1769, texts, of, the, first, three, verses, from, i, corinthians, 13, are, given, below, 1, though, i, speake, with, the, tongues, of, men, of, angels, and, haue, not, charity, i, am, become, as, sounding, brasse, or, a, tinkling, cymbal, 2, and, though, i, haue, the, gift, of, prophesie, and, vnderstand, all, mysteries, and, all, knowledge, and, though, i, haue, all, faith, so, that, i, could, remooue, mountaines, and, haue, no, charitie, i, am, nothing, 3, and, though, i, bestowe, all, my, goods, to, feede, the, poore, and, though, i, giue, my, body, to, bee, burned, and, haue, not, charitie, it, profiteth, me, nothing, 1, though, i, speak, with, the, tongues, of, men, and, of, angels, and, have, not, charity, i, am, become, as, sounding, brass, or, a, tinkling, cymbal, 2, and, though, i, have, the, gift, of, prophecy, and, understand, all, mysteries, and, all, knowledge, and, though, i, have, all, faith, so, that, i, could, remove, mountains, and, have, not, charity, i, am, nothing, 3, and, though, i, bestow, all, my, goods, to, feed, the, poor, and, though, i, give, my, body, to, be, burned, and, have, not, charity, it, profiteth, me, nothing, there, are, a, number, of, superficial, edits, in, these, three, verses, 11, changes, of, spelling, 16, changes, of, typesetting, including, the, changed, conventions, for, the, use, of, u, and, v, three, changes, of, punctuation, and, one, variant, text, where, not, charity, is, substituted, for, no, charity, in, verse, two, in, the, belief, that, the, original, reading, was, a, misprint, a, particular, verse, for, which, blayney, s, 1769, text, differs, from, parris, s, 1760, version, is, matthew, 5, 13, where, parris, 1760, has, ye, are, the, salt, of, the, earth, but, if, the, salt, have, lost, his, savour, wherewith, shall, it, be, salted, it, is, thenceforth, good, for, nothing, but, to, be, cast, out, and, to, be, troden, under, foot, of, men, blayney, 1769, changes, lost, his, savour, to, lost, its, savour, and, troden, to, trodden, for, a, period, cambridge, continued, to, issue, bibles, using, the, parris, text, but, the, market, demand, for, absolute, standardization, was, now, such, that, they, eventually, adapted, blayney, s, work, but, omitted, some, of, the, idiosyncratic, oxford, spellings, by, the, mid, 19th, century, almost, all, printings, of, the, authorized, version, were, derived, from, the, 1769, oxford, text, increasingly, without, blayney, s, variant, notes, and, cross, references, and, commonly, excluding, the, apocrypha, one, exception, to, this, was, a, scrupulous, original, spelling, page, for, page, and, line, for, line, reprint, of, the, 1611, edition, including, all, chapter, headings, marginalia, and, original, italicization, but, with, roman, type, substituted, for, the, black, letter, of, the, original, published, by, oxford, in, 1833, another, important, exception, was, the, 1873, cambridge, paragraph, bible, thoroughly, revised, modernized, and, re, edited, by, f, h, a, scrivener, who, for, the, first, time, consistently, identified, the, source, texts, underlying, the, 1611, translation, and, its, marginal, notes, scrivener, like, blayney, opted, to, revise, the, translation, where, he, considered, the, judgement, of, the, 1611, translators, had, been, faulty, in, 2005, cambridge, university, press, released, its, new, cambridge, paragraph, bible, with, apocrypha, edited, by, david, norton, which, followed, in, the, spirit, of, scrivener, s, work, attempting, to, bring, spelling, to, present, day, standards, norton, also, innovated, with, the, introduction, of, quotation, marks, while, returning, to, a, hypothetical, 1611, text, so, far, as, possible, to, the, wording, used, by, its, translators, especially, in, the, light, of, the, re, emphasis, on, some, of, their, draft, documents, this, text, has, been, issued, in, paperback, by, penguin, books, from, the, early, 19th, century, the, authorized, version, has, remained, almost, completely, unchanged, and, since, due, to, advances, in, printing, technology, it, could, now, be, produced, in, very, large, editions, for, mass, sale, it, established, complete, dominance, in, public, and, ecclesiastical, use, in, the, english, speaking, protestant, world, academic, debate, through, that, century, however, increasingly, reflected, concerns, about, the, authorized, version, shared, by, some, scholars, a, that, subsequent, study, in, oriental, languages, suggested, a, need, to, revise, the, translation, of, the, hebrew, bible, both, in, terms, of, specific, vocabulary, and, also, in, distinguishing, descriptive, terms, from, proper, names, b, that, the, authorized, version, was, unsatisfactory, in, translating, the, same, greek, words, and, phrases, into, different, english, especially, where, parallel, passages, are, found, in, the, synoptic, gospels, and, c, in, the, light, of, subsequent, ancient, manuscript, discoveries, the, new, testament, translation, base, of, the, greek, textus, receptus, could, no, longer, be, considered, to, be, the, best, representation, of, the, original, text, responding, to, these, concerns, the, convocation, of, canterbury, resolved, in, 1870, to, undertake, a, revision, of, the, text, of, the, authorized, version, intending, to, retain, the, original, text, except, where, in, the, judgement, of, competent, scholars, such, a, change, is, necessary, the, resulting, revision, was, issued, as, the, revised, version, in, 1881, new, testament, 1885, old, testament, and, 1894, apocrypha, but, although, it, sold, widely, the, revision, did, not, find, popular, favour, and, it, was, only, reluctantly, in, 1899, that, convocation, approved, it, for, reading, in, churches, by, the, early, 20th, century, editing, had, been, completed, in, cambridge, s, text, with, at, least, 6, new, changes, since, 1769, and, the, reversing, of, at, least, 30, of, the, standard, oxford, readings, the, distinct, cambridge, text, was, printed, in, the, millions, and, after, the, second, world, war, the, unchanging, steadiness, of, the, kjb, was, a, huge, asset, f, h, a, scrivener, and, d, norton, have, both, written, in, detail, on, editorial, variations, which, have, occurred, through, the, history, of, the, publishing, of, the, authorized, version, from, 1611, to, 1769, in, the, 19th, century, there, were, effectively, three, main, guardians, of, the, text, norton, identified, five, variations, among, the, oxford, cambridge, and, london, eyre, and, spottiswoode, texts, of, 1857, such, as, the, spelling, of, farther, or, further, at, matthew, 26, 39, in, the, 20th, century, variation, between, the, editions, was, reduced, to, comparing, the, cambridge, to, the, oxford, distinctly, identified, cambridge, readings, included, or, sheba, sin, clifts, vapour, flieth, further, and, a, number, of, other, references, in, effect, the, cambridge, was, considered, the, current, text, in, comparison, to, the, oxford, these, are, instances, where, both, oxford, and, cambridge, have, now, diverged, from, blayney, s, 1769, edition, the, distinctions, between, the, oxford, and, cambridge, editions, have, been, a, major, point, in, the, bible, version, debate, and, a, potential, theological, issue, particularly, in, regard, to, the, identification, of, the, pure, cambridge, edition, cambridge, university, press, introduced, a, change, at, 1, john, 5, 8, in, 1985, reversing, its, longstanding, tradition, of, printing, the, word, spirit, in, lower, case, by, using, a, capital, letter, s, a, rev, hardin, of, bedford, pennsylvania, wrote, a, letter, to, cambridge, inquiring, about, this, verse, and, received, a, reply, on, 3, june, 1985, from, the, bible, director, jerry, l, hooper, claiming, that, it, was, a, matter, of, some, embarrassment, regarding, the, lower, case, s, in, spirit, in, obedience, to, their, instructions, the, translators, provided, no, marginal, interpretation, of, the, text, but, in, some, 8, 500, places, a, marginal, note, offers, an, alternative, english, wording, the, majority, of, these, notes, offer, a, more, literal, rendering, of, the, original, introduced, as, heb, chal, chaldee, referring, to, aramaic, gr, or, lat, others, indicate, a, variant, reading, of, the, source, text, introduced, by, or, some, of, the, annotated, variants, derive, from, alternative, editions, in, the, original, languages, or, from, variant, forms, quoted, in, the, fathers, more, commonly, though, they, indicate, a, difference, between, the, literal, original, language, reading, and, that, in, the, translators, preferred, recent, latin, versions, tremellius, for, the, old, testament, junius, for, the, apocrypha, and, beza, for, the, new, testament, at, thirteen, places, in, the, new, testament, a, marginal, note, records, a, variant, reading, found, in, some, greek, manuscript, copies, in, almost, all, cases, reproducing, a, counterpart, textual, note, at, the, same, place, in, beza, s, editions, a, few, more, extensive, notes, clarify, biblical, names, and, units, of, measurement, or, currency, modern, reprintings, rarely, reproduce, these, annotated, variants, although, they, are, to, be, found, in, the, new, cambridge, paragraph, bible, in, addition, there, were, originally, some, 9, 000, scriptural, cross, references, in, which, one, text, was, related, to, another, such, cross, references, had, long, been, common, in, latin, bibles, and, most, of, those, in, the, authorized, version, were, copied, unaltered, from, this, latin, tradition, consequently, the, early, editions, of, the, kjv, retain, many, vulgate, verse, references, e, g, in, the, numbering, of, the, psalms, at, the, head, of, each, chapter, the, translators, provided, a, short, pr, cis, of, its, contents, with, verse, numbers, these, are, rarely, included, in, complete, form, in, modern, editions, also, in, obedience, to, their, instructions, the, translators, indicated, supplied, words, in, a, different, typeface, but, there, was, no, attempt, to, regularize, the, instances, where, this, practice, had, been, applied, across, the, different, companies, and, especially, in, the, new, testament, it, was, used, much, less, frequently, in, the, 1611, edition, than, would, later, be, the, case, in, one, verse, 1, john, 2, 23, an, entire, clause, was, printed, in, roman, type, as, it, had, also, been, in, the, great, bible, and, bishop, s, bible, indicating, a, reading, then, primarily, derived, from, the, vulgate, albeit, one, for, which, the, later, editions, of, beza, had, provided, a, greek, text, in, the, old, testament, the, translators, render, the, tetragrammaton, yhwh, by, the, lord, in, later, editions, in, small, capitals, as, l, ord, or, the, lord, god, for, yhwh, elohim, except, in, four, places, by, iehovah, however, if, the, tetragrammaton, occurs, with, the, hebrew, word, adonai, lord, then, it, is, rendered, not, as, the, lord, lord, but, as, the, lord, god, in, later, editions, it, appears, as, lord, god, with, god, in, small, capitals, indicating, to, the, reader, that, god, s, name, appears, in, the, original, hebrew, for, the, old, testament, the, translators, used, a, text, originating, in, the, editions, of, the, hebrew, rabbinic, bible, by, daniel, bomberg, 1524, 5, but, adjusted, this, to, conform, to, the, greek, lxx, or, latin, vulgate, in, passages, to, which, christian, tradition, had, attached, a, christological, interpretation, for, example, the, septuagint, reading, they, pierced, my, hands, and, my, feet, was, used, in, psalm, 22, 16, vs, the, masoretes, reading, of, the, hebrew, like, lions, my, hands, and, feet, otherwise, however, the, authorized, version, is, closer, to, the, hebrew, tradition, than, any, previous, english, translation, especially, in, making, use, of, the, rabbinic, commentaries, such, as, kimhi, in, elucidating, obscure, passages, in, the, masoretic, text, earlier, versions, had, been, more, likely, to, adopt, lxx, or, vulgate, readings, in, such, places, following, the, practice, of, the, geneva, bible, the, books, of, 1, esdras, and, 2, esdras, in, the, medieval, vulgate, old, testament, were, renamed, ezra, and, nehemiah, 3, esdras, and, 4, esdras, in, the, apocrypha, being, renamed, 1, esdras, and, 2, esdras, for, the, new, testament, the, translators, chiefly, used, the, 1598, and, 1588, 89, greek, editions, of, theodore, beza, which, also, present, beza, s, latin, version, of, the, greek, and, stephanus, s, edition, of, the, latin, vulgate, both, of, these, versions, were, extensively, referred, to, as, the, translators, conducted, all, discussions, amongst, themselves, in, latin, f, h, a, scrivener, identifies, 190, readings, where, the, authorized, version, translators, depart, from, beza, s, greek, text, generally, in, maintaining, the, wording, of, the, bishops, bible, and, other, earlier, english, translations, in, about, half, of, these, instances, the, authorized, version, translators, appear, to, follow, the, earlier, 1550, greek, textus, receptus, of, stephanus, for, the, other, half, scrivener, was, usually, able, to, find, corresponding, greek, readings, in, the, editions, of, erasmus, or, in, the, complutensian, polyglot, however, in, several, dozen, readings, he, notes, that, no, printed, greek, text, corresponds, to, the, english, of, the, authorized, version, which, in, these, places, derives, directly, from, the, vulgate, for, example, at, john, 10, 16, the, authorized, version, reads, one, fold, as, did, the, bishops, bible, and, the, 16th, century, vernacular, versions, produced, in, geneva, following, the, latin, vulgate, unum, ovile, whereas, tyndale, had, agreed, more, closely, with, the, greek, one, flocke, the, authorized, version, new, testament, owes, much, more, to, the, vulgate, than, does, the, old, testament, still, at, least, 80, of, the, text, is, unaltered, from, tyndale, s, translation, unlike, the, rest, of, the, bible, the, translators, of, the, apocrypha, identified, their, source, texts, in, their, marginal, notes, from, these, it, can, be, determined, that, the, books, of, the, apocrypha, were, translated, from, the, septuagint, primarily, from, the, greek, old, testament, column, in, the, antwerp, polyglot, but, with, extensive, reference, to, the, counterpart, latin, vulgate, text, and, to, junius, s, latin, translation, the, translators, record, references, to, the, sixtine, septuagint, of, 1587, which, is, substantially, a, printing, of, the, old, testament, text, from, the, codex, vaticanus, graecus, 1209, and, also, to, the, 1518, greek, septuagint, edition, of, aldus, manutius, they, had, however, no, greek, texts, for, 2, esdras, or, for, the, prayer, of, manasses, and, scrivener, found, that, they, here, used, an, unidentified, latin, manuscript, the, translators, appear, to, have, otherwise, made, no, first, hand, study, of, ancient, manuscript, sources, even, those, that, like, the, codex, bezae, would, have, been, readily, available, to, them, in, addition, to, all, previous, english, versions, including, and, contrary, to, their, instructions, the, rheimish, new, testament, which, in, their, preface, they, criticized, they, made, wide, and, eclectic, use, of, all, printed, editions, in, the, original, languages, then, available, including, the, ancient, syriac, new, testament, printed, with, an, interlinear, latin, gloss, in, the, antwerp, polyglot, of, 1573, in, the, preface, the, translators, acknowledge, consulting, translations, and, commentaries, in, chaldee, hebrew, syrian, greek, latin, spanish, french, italian, and, german, the, translators, took, the, bishops, bible, as, their, source, text, and, where, they, departed, from, that, in, favour, of, another, translation, this, was, most, commonly, the, geneva, bible, however, the, degree, to, which, readings, from, the, bishops, bible, survived, into, final, text, of, the, king, james, bible, varies, greatly, from, company, to, company, as, did, the, propensity, of, the, king, james, translators, to, coin, phrases, of, their, own, john, bois, s, notes, of, the, general, committee, of, review, show, that, they, discussed, readings, derived, from, a, wide, variety, of, versions, and, patristic, sources, including, explicitly, both, henry, savile, s, 1610, edition, of, the, works, of, john, chrysostom, and, the, rheims, new, testament, which, was, the, primary, source, for, many, of, the, literal, alternative, readings, provided, for, the, marginal, notes, a, number, of, bible, verses, in, the, king, james, version, of, the, new, testament, are, not, found, in, more, recent, bible, translations, where, these, are, based, on, modern, critical, texts, in, the, early, seventeenth, century, the, source, greek, texts, of, the, new, testament, which, were, used, to, produce, protestant, bible, versions, were, mainly, dependent, on, manuscripts, of, the, late, byzantine, text, type, and, they, also, contained, minor, variations, which, became, known, as, the, textus, receptus, with, the, subsequent, identification, of, much, earlier, manuscripts, most, modern, textual, scholars, value, the, evidence, of, manuscripts, which, belong, to, the, alexandrian, family, as, better, witnesses, to, the, original, text, of, the, biblical, authors, without, giving, it, or, any, family, automatic, preference, a, primary, concern, of, the, translators, was, to, produce, an, appropriate, bible, dignified, and, resonant, in, public, reading, although, the, authorized, version, s, written, style, is, an, important, part, of, its, influence, on, english, research, has, found, only, one, verse, hebrews, 13, 8, for, which, translators, debated, the, wording, s, literary, merits, while, they, stated, in, the, preface, that, they, used, stylistic, variation, finding, multiple, english, words, or, verbal, forms, in, places, where, the, original, language, employed, repetition, in, practice, they, also, did, the, opposite, for, example, 14, different, hebrew, words, were, translated, into, the, single, english, word, prince, in, a, period, of, rapid, linguistic, change, the, translators, avoided, contemporary, idioms, tending, instead, towards, forms, that, were, already, slightly, archaic, like, verily, and, it, came, to, pass, the, pronouns, thou, thee, and, ye, you, are, consistently, used, as, singular, and, plural, respectively, even, though, by, this, time, you, was, often, found, as, the, singular, in, general, english, usage, especially, when, addressing, a, social, superior, as, is, evidenced, for, example, in, shakespeare, for, the, possessive, of, the, third, person, pronoun, the, word, its, first, recorded, in, the, oxford, english, dictionary, in, 1598, is, avoided, the, older, his, is, usually, employed, as, for, example, at, matthew, 5, 13, if, the, salt, have, lost, his, savour, wherewith, shall, it, be, salted, in, other, places, of, it, thereof, or, bare, it, are, found, another, sign, of, linguistic, conservatism, is, the, invariable, use, of, eth, for, the, third, person, singular, present, form, of, the, verb, as, at, matthew, 2, 13, the, angel, of, the, lord, appear, eth, to, joseph, in, a, dreame, the, rival, ending, e, s, as, found, in, present, day, english, was, already, widely, used, by, this, time, for, example, it, predominates, over, eth, in, the, plays, of, shakespeare, and, marlowe, furthermore, the, translators, preferred, which, to, who, or, whom, as, the, relative, pronoun, for, persons, as, in, genesis, 13, 5, and, lot, also, which, went, with, abram, had, flocks, and, heards, tents, although, who, m, is, also, found, the, authorized, version, is, notably, more, latinate, than, previous, english, versions, especially, the, geneva, bible, this, results, in, part, from, the, academic, stylistic, preferences, of, a, number, of, the, translators, several, of, whom, admitted, to, being, more, comfortable, writing, in, latin, than, in, english, but, was, also, in, part, a, consequence, of, the, royal, proscription, against, explanatory, notes, hence, where, the, geneva, bible, might, use, a, common, english, word, and, gloss, its, particular, application, in, a, marginal, note, the, authorized, version, tends, rather, to, prefer, a, technical, term, frequently, in, anglicized, latin, consequently, although, the, king, had, instructed, the, translators, to, use, the, bishops, bible, as, a, base, text, the, new, testament, in, particular, owes, much, stylistically, to, the, catholic, rheims, new, testament, whose, translators, had, also, been, concerned, to, find, english, equivalents, for, latin, terminology, in, addition, the, translators, of, the, new, testament, books, transliterate, names, found, in, the, old, testament, in, their, greek, forms, rather, than, in, the, forms, closer, to, the, old, testament, hebrew, e, g, elias, and, noe, for, elijah, and, noah, respectively, while, the, authorized, version, remains, among, the, most, widely, sold, modern, critical, new, testament, translations, differ, substantially, from, it, in, a, number, of, passages, primarily, because, they, rely, on, source, manuscripts, not, then, accessible, to, or, not, then, highly, regarded, by, early, 17th, century, biblical, scholarship, in, the, old, testament, there, are, also, many, differences, from, modern, translations, that, are, based, not, on, manuscript, differences, but, on, a, different, understanding, of, ancient, hebrew, vocabulary, or, grammar, by, the, translators, for, example, in, modern, translations, it, is, clear, that, job, 28, 1, 11, is, referring, throughout, to, mining, operations, which, is, not, at, all, apparent, from, the, text, of, the, authorized, version, the, king, james, version, contains, several, alleged, mistranslations, especially, in, the, old, testament, where, the, knowledge, of, hebrew, and, cognate, languages, was, uncertain, at, the, time, among, the, most, commonly, cited, errors, is, in, the, hebrew, of, job, and, deuteronomy, where, hebrew, romanized, re, em, with, the, probable, meaning, of, wild, ox, aurochs, is, translated, in, the, kjv, as, unicorn, following, in, this, the, vulgate, unicornis, and, several, medieval, rabbinic, commentators, the, translators, of, the, kjv, note, the, alternative, rendering, rhinocerots, in, the, margin, at, isaiah, 34, 7, on, a, similar, note, martin, luther, s, german, translation, had, also, relied, on, the, latin, vulgate, on, this, point, consistently, translating, using, the, german, word, for, unicorn, einhorn, otherwise, the, translators, are, accused, on, several, occasions, to, have, mistakenly, interpreted, a, hebrew, descriptive, phrase, as, a, proper, name, or, vice, versa, as, at, 2, samuel, 1, 18, where, the, book, of, jasher, hebrew, romanized, sepher, ha, yasher, properly, refers, not, to, a, work, by, an, author, of, that, name, but, should, rather, be, rendered, as, the, book, of, the, upright, which, was, proposed, as, an, alternative, reading, in, a, marginal, note, to, the, kjv, text, despite, royal, patronage, and, encouragement, there, was, never, any, overt, mandate, to, use, the, new, translation, it, was, not, until, 1661, that, the, authorized, version, replaced, the, bishops, bible, in, the, epistle, and, gospel, lessons, of, the, book, of, common, prayer, and, it, never, did, replace, the, older, translation, in, the, psalter, in, 1763, the, critical, review, complained, that, many, false, interpretations, ambiguous, phrases, obsolete, words, and, indelicate, expressions, excite, the, derision, of, the, scorner, blayney, s, 1769, version, with, its, revised, spelling, and, punctuation, helped, change, the, public, perception, of, the, authorized, version, to, a, masterpiece, of, the, english, language, by, the, 19th, century, f, w, faber, could, say, of, the, translation, it, lives, on, the, ear, like, music, that, can, never, be, forgotten, like, the, sound, of, church, bells, which, the, convert, hardly, knows, how, he, can, forego, geddes, macgregor, called, the, authorized, version, the, most, influential, version, of, the, most, influential, book, in, the, world, in, what, is, now, its, most, influential, language, the, most, important, book, in, english, religion, and, culture, and, the, most, celebrated, book, in, the, english, speaking, world, david, crystal, has, estimated, that, it, is, responsible, for, 257, idioms, in, english, examples, include, feet, of, clay, and, reap, the, whirlwind, furthermore, prominent, atheist, figures, such, as, christopher, hitchens, and, richard, dawkins, have, praised, the, king, james, version, as, being, a, giant, step, in, the, maturing, of, english, literature, and, a, great, work, of, literature, respectively, with, dawkins, then, adding, a, native, speaker, of, english, who, has, never, read, a, word, of, the, king, james, bible, is, verging, on, the, barbarian, the, king, james, version, is, one, of, the, versions, authorized, to, be, used, in, the, services, of, the, episcopal, church, and, other, parts, of, the, anglican, communion, as, it, is, the, historical, bible, of, this, church, it, was, presented, to, king, charles, iii, at, his, coronation, service, other, christian, denominations, have, also, accepted, the, king, james, version, the, king, james, version, is, used, by, english, speaking, conservative, anabaptists, along, with, methodists, of, the, conservative, holiness, movement, in, addition, to, certain, baptists, in, the, orthodox, church, in, america, it, is, used, liturgically, and, was, made, the, official, translation, for, a, whole, generation, of, american, orthodox, the, later, service, book, of, the, antiochian, archdiocese, in, vogue, today, also, uses, the, king, james, version, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, continues, to, use, its, own, edition, of, the, authorized, version, as, its, official, english, bible, although, the, authorized, version, s, preeminence, in, the, english, speaking, world, has, diminished, for, example, the, church, of, england, recommends, six, other, versions, in, addition, to, it, it, is, still, the, most, used, translation, in, the, united, states, especially, as, the, scofield, reference, bible, for, evangelicals, however, over, the, past, forty, years, it, has, been, gradually, overtaken, by, modern, versions, principally, the, new, international, version, 1973, the, new, revised, standard, version, 1989, and, the, english, standard, version, 2001, the, latter, of, which, is, seen, as, a, successor, to, the, king, james, version, the, king, james, only, movement, advocates, the, belief, that, the, king, james, version, is, superior, to, all, other, english, translations, of, the, bible, most, adherents, of, the, movement, believe, that, the, textus, receptus, is, very, close, if, not, identical, to, the, original, autographs, thereby, making, it, the, ideal, greek, source, for, the, translation, they, argue, that, manuscripts, such, as, the, codex, sinaiticus, and, codex, vaticanus, on, which, most, modern, english, translations, are, based, are, corrupted, new, testament, texts, one, of, them, perry, demopoulos, was, a, director, of, the, translation, of, the, king, james, bible, into, russian, in, 2010, the, russian, translation, of, the, kjv, of, the, new,

used, translations, of, the, books, of, the, biblical, apocrypha, were, necessary, for, the, king, james, version, as, readings, from, these, books, were, included, in, the, daily, old, testament, lectionary, of, the, book, of, common, prayer, protestant, bibles, in, the, 16th, century, included, the, books, of, the, apocrypha, generally, following, the, luther, bible, in, a, separate, section, between, the, old, and, new, testaments, to, indicate, they, were, not, considered, part, of, the, old, testament, text, and, there, is, evidence, that, these, were, widely, read, as, popular, literature, especially, in, puritan, circles, the, apocrypha, of, the, king, james, version, has, the, same, 14, books, as, had, been, found, in, the, apocrypha, of, the, bishops, bible, however, following, the, practice, of, the, geneva, bible, the, first, two, books, of, the, apocrypha, were, renamed, 1, esdras, and, 2, esdras, as, compared, to, the, names, in, the, thirty, nine, articles, with, the, corresponding, old, testament, books, being, renamed, ezra, and, nehemiah, starting, in, 1630, volumes, of, the, geneva, bible, were, occasionally, bound, with, the, pages, of, the, apocrypha, section, excluded, in, 1644, the, long, parliament, forbade, the, reading, of, the, apocrypha, in, churches, and, in, 1666, the, first, editions, of, the, king, james, bible, without, the, apocrypha, were, bound, the, standardization, of, the, text, of, the, authorized, version, after, 1769, together, with, the, technological, development, of, stereotype, printing, made, it, possible, to, produce, bibles, in, large, print, runs, at, very, low, unit, prices, for, commercial, and, charitable, publishers, editions, of, the, authorized, version, without, the, apocrypha, reduced, the, cost, while, having, increased, market, appeal, to, non, anglican, protestant, readers, with, the, rise, of, the, bible, societies, most, editions, have, omitted, the, whole, section, of, apocryphal, books, the, british, and, foreign, bible, society, withdrew, subsidies, for, bible, printing, and, dissemination, in, 1826, under, the, following, resolution, that, the, funds, of, the, society, be, applied, to, the, printing, and, circulation, of, the, canonical, books, of, scripture, to, the, exclusion, of, those, books, and, parts, of, books, usually, termed, apocryphal, the, american, bible, society, adopted, a, similar, policy, both, societies, eventually, reversed, these, policies, in, light, of, 20th, century, ecumenical, efforts, on, translations, the, abs, doing, so, in, 1964, and, the, bfbs, in, 1966, the, translators, that, produced, the, king, james, version, relied, mainly, it, seems, on, the, later, editions, of, beza, s, greek, new, testament, especially, his, 4th, edition, 1588, 9, but, also, they, frequently, consulted, the, editions, of, erasmus, and, stephanus, and, the, complutensian, polyglot, according, to, scrivener, 1884, 51, out, of, the, 252, passages, in, which, these, sources, differ, sufficiently, to, affect, the, english, rendering, the, king, james, version, agrees, with, beza, against, stephanus, 113, times, with, stephanus, against, beza, 59, times, and, 80, times, with, erasmus, or, the, complutensian, or, the, latin, vulgate, against, beza, and, stephanus, hence, the, king, james, version, ought, to, be, regarded, not, merely, as, a, translation, of, the, textus, receptus, but, also, as, an, independent, variety, of, the, textus, receptus, chronological, order, of, publication, newest, first
