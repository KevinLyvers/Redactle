within, the, oresteia, trilogy, it, details, the, homecoming, of, agamemnon, king, of, mycenae, from, the, trojan, war, after, ten, years, of, warfare, troy, had, fallen, and, all, of, greece, could,

play, opens, with, a, watchman, looking, down, and, over, the, sea, reporting, that, he, has, been, lying, restless, like, a, dog, for, a, year, waiting, to, see, some, sort, of, signal, confirming, a, greek, victory, in, troy, he, laments, the, fortunes, of, the, house, but, promises, to, keep, silent, a, huge, ox, has, stepped, onto, my, tongue, the, watchman, sees, a, light, far, off, in, the, distance, a, bonfire, signaling, troy, s, fall, and, is, overjoyed, at, the, victory, and, hopes, for, the, hasty, return, of, his, king, as, the, house, has, wallowed, in, his, absence, clytemnestra, is, introduced, to, the, audience, and, she, declares, that, there, will, be, celebrations, and, sacrifices, throughout, the, city, as, agamemnon, and, his, army, return, upon, the, return, of, agamemnon, his, wife, laments, in, full, view, of, argos, how, horrible, the, wait, for, her, husband, and, king, has, been, after, her, soliloquy, clytemnestra, pleads, with, and, persuades, agamemnon, to, walk, on, the, robes, laid, out, for, him, this, is, a, very, ominous, moment, in, the, play, as, loyalties, and, motives, are, questioned, the, king, s, new, concubine, cassandra, is, now, introduced, and, this, immediately, spawns, hatred, from, the, queen, clytemnestra, cassandra, is, ordered, out, of, her, chariot, and, to, the, altar, where, once, she, is, alone, she, begins, predicting, the, death, of, agamemnon, and, her, own, shared, fate, inside, the, house, a, cry, is, heard, agamemnon, has, been, stabbed, in, the, bathtub, the, chorus, separates, from, one, another, and, rambles, to, themselves, proving, their, cowardice, when, another, final, cry, is, heard, when, the, doors, are, finally, opened, clytemnestra, is, seen, standing, over, the, dead, bodies, of, agamemnon, and, cassandra, clytemnestra, describes, the, murder, in, detail, to, the, chorus, showing, no, sign, of, remorse, or, regret, suddenly, the, exiled, lover, of, clytemnestra, aegisthus, bursts, into, the, palace, to, take, his, place, next, to, her, aegisthus, proudly, states, that, he, devised, the, plan, to, murder, agamemnon, and, claim, revenge, for, his, father, the, father, of, aegisthus, thyestes, was, tricked, into, eating, two, of, his, sons, by, his, brother, atreus, the, father, of, agamemnon, clytemnestra, claims, that, she, and, aegisthus, now, have, all, the, power, and, they, re, enter, the, palace, with, the, doors, closing, behind, them, like, most, greek, tragedies, agamemnon, is, a, morally, complex, play, agamemnon, may, be, an, admired, veteran, of, the, trojan, war, but, it, is, made, clear, that, many, do, not, approve, of, the, way, he, sacrificed, his, daughter, iphigenia, many, citizens, resent, agamemnon, because, they, lost, their, sons, and, husbands, in, the, war, he, initiated, similarly, clytemnestra, is, both, her, husband, s, murderer, and, her, daughter, s, avenger, aeschylus, continues, to, explore, the, fundamental, moral, quandary, of, vengeance, and, justified, bloodshed, in, the, libation, bearers, and, the, eumenides, in, the, libation, bearers, cho, ph, roi, the, second, play, of, aeschylus, oresteia, trilogy, many, years, after, the, murder, of, agamemnon, his, son, orestes, returns, to, argos, with, his, cousin, pylades, to, exact, vengeance, on, clytemnestra, as, an, order, from, apollo, for, killing, agamemnon, upon, arriving, orestes, reunites, with, his, sister, electra, at, agamemnon, s, grave, while, she, was, there, bringing, libations, to, agamemnon, in, an, attempt, to, stop, clytemnestra, s, bad, dreams, shortly, after, the, reunion, both, orestes, and, electra, influenced, by, the, chorus, come, up, with, a, plan, to, kill, both, clytemnestra, and, aegisthus, orestes, then, goes, to, the, palace, door, where, he, is, greeted, by, clytemnestra, he, pretends, he, is, a, stranger, and, tells, clytemnestra, that, he, orestes, is, dead, causing, her, to, send, for, aegisthus, unrecognized, orestes, is, then, able, to, enter, the, palace, where, he, then, kills, aegisthus, who, was, without, a, guard, due, to, the, intervention, of, the, chorus, in, relaying, clytemnestra, s, message, clytemnestra, then, enters, the, room, orestes, hesitates, to, kill, her, but, pylades, reminds, him, of, apollo, s, orders, and, he, eventually, follows, through, consequently, after, committing, the, matricide, orestes, is, now, the, target, of, the, furies, merciless, wrath, and, has, no, choice, but, to, flee, from, the, palace, the, chorus, in, the, libation, bearers, is, distinctly, different, than, the, one, in, agamemnon, from, agamemnon, to, the, libation, bearers, the, chorus, switches, from, a, collection, of, old, argive, men, to, foreign, slave, women, p, 46, 48, furthermore, the, chorus, in, agamemnon, possessed, a, fearful, voice, characterized, by, their, critical, commentary, on, the, events, and, characters, of, the, play, despite, this, they, play, a, passive, role, and, do, not, influence, the, plot, p, 47, 48, in, contrast, the, libation, bearers, chorus, desire, vengeance, and, influence, both, electra, s, and, orestes, actions, shepherding, orestes, towards, revenge, p, 48, 52, the, final, play, of, the, oresteia, called, the, eumenides, eumen, des, illustrates, how, the, sequence, of, events, in, the, trilogy, ends, up, in, the, development, of, social, order, or, a, proper, judicial, system, in, athenian, society, in, this, play, orestes, is, hunted, and, tormented, by, the, furies, a, trio, of, goddesses, known, to, be, the, instruments, of, justice, who, are, also, referred, to, as, the, gracious, ones, eumenides, they, relentlessly, pursue, orestes, for, the, killing, of, his, mother, through, the, intervention, of, apollo, orestes, is, able, to, escape, them, for, a, brief, moment, while, they, are, asleep, and, escape, to, athens, under, the, protection, of, hermes, seeing, the, furies, asleep, clytemnestra, s, ghost, comes, to, wake, them, up, to, obtain, justice, on, her, son, orestes, for, killing, her, after, waking, up, the, furies, hunt, orestes, again, and, when, they, find, him, orestes, pleads, to, the, goddess, athena, for, help, she, responds, by, setting, up, a, trial, for, him, in, athens, on, the, areopagus, this, trial, is, made, up, of, a, group, of, twelve, athenian, citizens, and, is, supervised, by, athena, here, orestes, is, used, as, a, trial, dummy, by, athena, to, set, up, the, first, courtroom, trial, he, is, also, the, object, of, the, furies, apollo, and, athena, after, the, trial, comes, to, an, end, the, votes, are, tied, athena, casts, the, deciding, vote, and, determines, that, orestes, will, not, be, killed, this, does, not, sit, well, with, the, furies, but, athena, eventually, persuades, them, to, accept, the, decision, instead, of, violently, retaliating, against, wrongdoers, become, a, constructive, force, of, vigilance, in, athens, she, then, changes, their, names, from, the, furies, to, the, eumenides, which, means, the, gracious, ones, athena, then, ultimately, rules, that, all, trials, must, henceforth, be, settled, in, court, rather, than, being, carried, out, personally, proteus, pr, teus, the, satyr, play, which, originally, followed, the, first, three, plays, of, the, oresteia, is, lost, except, for, a, two, line, fragment, preserved, by, athenaeus, it, is, widely, believed, to, have, been, based, on, the, story, told, in, book, iv, of, homer, s, odyssey, where, menelaus, agamemnon, s, brother, tries, to, return, home, from, troy, and, finds, himself, on, an, island, off, egypt, whither, he, seems, to, have, been, carried, by, the, storm, described, in, agam, 674, the, title, character, the, deathless, egyptian, proteus, the, old, man, of, the, sea, is, described, in, homer, as, having, been, visited, by, menelaus, who, sought, to, learn, his, future, proteus, tells, menelaus, of, the, death, of, agamemnon, at, the, hands, of, aegisthus, and, the, fates, of, ajax, the, lesser, and, odysseus, at, sea, proteus, is, compelled, to, tell, menelaus, how, to, reach, home, from, the, island, of, pharos, the, satyrs, who, may, have, found, themselves, on, the, island, as, a, result, of, shipwreck, perhaps, gave, assistance, to, menelaus, and, escaped, with, him, though, he, may, have, had, difficulty, in, ensuring, that, they, keep, their, hands, off, helen, the, only, extant, fragment, that, has, been, definitively, attributed, to, proteus, was, translated, by, herbert, weir, smyth, a, wretched, piteous, dove, in, quest, of, food, dashed, amid, the, winnowing, fans, its, breast, broken, in, twain, in, 2002, theatre, kingston, mounted, a, production, of, the, oresteia, and, included, a, new, reconstruction, of, proteus, based, on, the, episode, in, the, odyssey, and, loosely, arranged, according, to, the, structure, of, extant, satyr, plays, retaliation, is, seen, in, the, oresteia, to, cascade, in, agamemnon, it, is, mentioned, that, agamemnon, had, to, sacrifice, his, innocent, daughter, iphigenia, to, shift, the, wind, for, his, voyage, to, troy, this, caused, clytemnestra, to, plot, revenge, on, agamemnon, she, found, a, new, lover, aegisthus, and, when, agamemnon, returned, to, argos, from, the, trojan, war, clytemnestra, killed, him, by, stabbing, him, in, the, bathtub, and, went, on, to, inherit, his, throne, the, death, of, agamemnon, thus, sparks, anger, in, orestes, and, electra, they, plot, matricide, the, death, of, their, mother, clytemnestra, in, the, next, play, libation, bearers, through, much, pressure, from, electra, and, his, cousin, pylades, orestes, kills, clytemnestra, and, her, lover, aegisthus, consequently, orestes, is, hunted, down, by, the, furies, in, the, third, play, the, eumenides, even, after, he, escapes, clytemnestra, s, spirit, comes, back, to, rally, them, again, so, that, they, can, kill, orestes, and, obtain, vengeance, for, her, however, this, cycle, of, retaliation, comes, to, a, stop, near, the, end, of, the, eumenides, when, athena, decides, to, introduce, a, new, legal, system, for, dealing, out, justice, justice, through, the, law, is, achieved, in, the, eumenides, after, orestes, begged, athena, for, deliverance, from, the, furies, she, granted, him, his, request, in, the, form, of, a, trial, rather, than, forgiving, orestes, directly, athena, put, him, to, trial, to, find, a, just, answer, to, the, question, of, his, innocence, this, is, the, first, example, of, proper, litigation, in, the, trilogy, and, illuminates, the, change, from, emotional, retaliation, to, civilized, decisions, regarding, alleged, crimes, instead, of, allowing, the, furies, to, torture, orestes, she, decided, that, she, would, have, both, the, furies, and, orestes, plead, their, case, before, she, decided, on, the, verdict, in, addition, athena, set, up, how, the, verdict, would, be, decided, by, creating, this, blueprint, the, future, of, revenge, killings, and, the, merciless, hunting, of, the, furies, would, be, eliminated, from, greece, the, trial, sets, the, foundation, for, future, litigation, aeschylus, through, his, jury, trial, was, able, to, create, and, maintain, a, social, commentary, about, the, limitations, of, revenge, crimes, and, reiterate, the, importance, of, trials, the, oresteia, as, a, whole, stands, as, a, representation, of, the, evolution, of, justice, in, ancient, greece, revenge, is, a, principal, motivator, for, most, characters, in, oresteia, the, theme, starts, in, agamemnon, with, clytemnestra, who, murders, her, husband, agamemnon, in, order, to, obtain, vengeance, for, his, sacrificing, of, their, daughter, iphigenia, the, death, of, cassandra, the, princess, of, troy, taken, captive, by, agamemnon, in, order, to, fill, a, place, as, a, concubine, can, also, be, seen, as, an, act, of, revenge, for, taking, another, woman, as, well, as, the, life, of, iphigenia, later, on, in, the, libation, bearers, orestes, and, electra, siblings, and, remaining, children, of, agamemnon, and, clytemnestra, succeed, in, killing, their, mother, to, avenge, their, father, s, death, in, the, eumenides, the, furies, goddesses, of, vengeance, seek, to, take, revenge, on, orestes, for, the, murder, of, his, mother, it, is, also, discovered, that, the, god, apollo, played, a, part, in, the, act, of, vengeance, toward, clytemnestra, through, orestes, the, cycle, of, revenge, is, seen, to, be, broken, when, orestes, is, not, killed, by, the, furies, but, is, instead, given, his, freedom, and, deemed, innocent, by, the, goddess, athena, to, the, anthropologist, johann, jakob, bachofen, das, mutterrecht, 1861, the, oresteia, shows, ancient, greece, s, transition, from, hetaerism, polyamory, to, monogamy, and, from, mother, right, matriarchal, lineage, to, father, right, patriarchal, lineage, according, to, bachofen, religious, laws, changed, in, this, period, the, apollo, and, athena, of, the, eumenides, present, the, patriarchal, view, the, furies, contrast, what, they, call, gods, of, new, descent, with, the, view, that, matricide, is, more, serious, than, the, killing, of, men, with, athena, acquitting, orestes, and, the, furies, working, for, the, new, gods, the, eumenides, shows, the, newfound, dominance, of, father, right, over, mother, right, bachofen, s, interpretation, was, influential, among, marxists, and, feminists, feminist, simone, de, beauvoir, wrote, in, the, second, sex, 1949, that, the, tribunal, saw, orestes, as, son, of, agamemnon, before, being, son, of, clytemnestra, in, the, origin, of, the, family, private, property, and, the, state, 1884, marxist, friedrich, engels, praises, bachofen, s, correct, interpretation, nonetheless, he, sees, it, as, pure, mysticism, by, bachofen, to, see, the, change, in, divine, perspectives, as, the, cause, of, the, change, in, greek, society, instead, engels, considers, economic, factors, the, creation, of, private, property, and, the, natural, sexual, behaviour, of, men, and, women, for, the, feminist, kate, millett, the, latter, factor, is, mistaken, and, the, eumenides, is, important, in, documenting, the, state, s, arguments, for, repression, of, women, electra, s, role, in, the, murder, of, her, mother, has, been, hotly, contested, by, scholars, throughout, time, many, view, electra, s, by, proxy, killing, of, her, mother, as, a, representation, of, daughter, inflicted, matricide, psychoanalyst, carl, jung, attributes, her, behavior, to, what, he, coined, as, the, electra, complex, the, jealousy, of, the, daughter, towards, the, mother, for, her, sexual, engagement, with, the, father, sigmund, freud, disagreed, with, this, claim, noting, that, the, oedipus, complex, cannot, be, applied, directly, to, the, female, sex, since, daughters, do, not, undergo, the, same, penis, envy, as, sons, many, contemporary, scholars, have, theorized, what, this, matricide, means, in, the, context, of, womanhood, dana, tor, invokes, lacan, to, argue, that, electra, s, scheming, represents, a, ravage, between, mother, and, daughter, doris, bernstein, sees, the, murder, as, a, step, on, the, path, towards, electra, s, individuation, and, melanie, klein, views, it, as, emblematic, of, the, dual, power, of, the, psyche, to, split, of, the, mother, into, a, good, object, and, a, bad, one, serena, heller, recalls, ronald, britton, s, idea, of, the, athene, antigone, complex, to, explain, electra, s, hatred, of, her, mother, deriving, from, an, intense, idolization, of, her, father, and, thus, a, compulsion, to, exonerate, herself, from, the, restraints, of, feminity, and, the, female, body, once, the, girl, recognizes, her, gendered, difference, in, the, world, she, must, undergo, re, cognition, deciding, whether, to, mourn, the, maleness, that, she, does, not, possess, or, engage, in, a, choice, which, frees, them, from, their, gendered, bind, athene, antigone, and, electra, all, have, a, desire, for, female, castration, that, dictates, their, choices, in, their, patriarchal, societies, amber, jacobs, also, claims, that, the, matricide, in, the, oresteia, ultimately, embodies, a, societal, repulsion, towards, the, female, gender, as, athena, s, motherless, status, allows, zeus, to, argue, that, the, father, is, more, important, than, the, mother, and, absolve, orestes, of, his, crimes, tor, ultimately, claims, that, the, convergence, of, both, orestes, and, electra, s, motivations, for, revenge, are, two, fold, both, a, repayment, for, the, debt, of, desire, and, a, symbol, of, feminine, jouissance, they, must, repay, their, freudian, or, jungian, debts, from, the, guilt, of, want, their, jouissance, in, her, death, arises, from, a, pre, genital, dichotomy, of, love, and, hatred, from, the, son, and, the, daughter, towards, the, mother, professor, of, philosophical, and, historical, anthropology, elizabeth, von, samsonow, notes, the, intense, debate, over, electra, s, relevance, in, the, murder, of, clymenestra, sophocles, for, example, viewed, her, as, a, key, component, of, the, killing, while, aeschylus, sees, her, as, incidental, but, refutes, the, tendency, to, shoehorn, her, motivations, into, freud, s, model, she, asks, for, scholars, to, reconsider, electra, as, undergoing, vagina, envy, resulting, from, the, woman, s, powerful, and, sexually, active, position, in, pre, hellenic, society, by, liberating, electra, from, the, male, centric, complexes, and, histories, that, restrict, her, motivations, study, of, mother, daughter, relations, can, evolve, into, an, outline, of, a, future, world, in, another, of, her, works, jacobs, too, writes, on, the, untheorized, state, of, matricide, in, literature, and, asks, for, an, expansion, of, symbolism, beyond, the, classic, oedipean, model, the, house, of, atreus, began, with, tantalus, son, of, zeus, who, murdered, his, son, pelops, and, attempted, to, feed, him, to, the, gods, the, gods, however, were, not, tricked, and, banished, tantalus, to, the, underworld, and, brought, his, son, back, to, life, later, in, life, pelops, and, his, family, line, were, cursed, by, myrtilus, a, son, of, hermes, catalyzing, the, curse, of, the, house, of, atreus, pelops, had, two, children, atreus, and, thyestes, who, are, said, to, have, killed, their, half, brother, chrysippus, and, were, therefore, banished, thyestes, and, aerope, atreus, wife, were, found, out, to, be, having, an, affair, and, in, an, act, of, vengeance, atreus, murdered, his, brother, s, sons, cooked, them, and, then, fed, them, to, thyestes, thyestes, had, a, son, with, his, daughter, and, named, him, aegisthus, who, went, on, to, kill, atreus, atreus, children, were, agamemnon, menelaus, and, anaxibia, leading, up, to, here, we, can, see, that, the, curse, of, the, house, of, atreus, was, one, forged, from, murder, incest, and, deceit, and, continued, in, this, way, for, generations, through, the, family, line, to, put, it, simply, the, curse, demands, blood, for, blood, a, never, ending, cycle, of, murder, within, the, family, those, who, join, the, family, seem, to, play, a, part, in, the, curse, as, well, as, seen, in, clytemnestra, when, she, murders, her, husband, agamemnon, in, revenge, for, sacrificing, their, daughter, iphigenia, orestes, goaded, by, his, sister, electra, murders, clytemnestra, in, order, to, exact, revenge, for, her, killing, his, father, orestes, is, said, to, be, the, end, of, the, curse, of, the, house, of, atreus, the, curse, holds, a, major, part, in, the, oresteia, and, is, mentioned, in, it, multiple, times, showing, that, many, of, the, characters, are, very, aware, of, the, curse, s, existence, aeschylus, was, able, to, use, the, curse, in, his, play, as, an, ideal, formulation, of, tragedy, in, his, writing, some, scholars, believe, that, the, trilogy, is, influenced, by, contemporary, political, developments, in, athens, a, few, years, previously, legislation, sponsored, by, the, democratic, reformer, ephialtes, had, stripped, the, court, of, the, areopagus, hitherto, one, of, the, most, powerful, vehicles, of, upper, class, political, power, of, all, of, its, functions, except, some, minor, religious, duties, and, the, authority, to, try, homicide, cases, by, having, his, story, being, resolved, by, a, judgement, of, the, areopagus, aeschylus, may, be, expressing, his, approval, of, this, reform, it, may, also, be, significant, that, aeschylus, makes, agamemnon, lord, of, argos, where, homer, puts, his, house, instead, of, his, nearby, capitol, mycenae, since, about, this, time, athens, had, entered, into, an, alliance, with, argos, in, 1981, sir, peter, hall, directed, tony, harrison, s, adaptation, of, the, trilogy, in, masks, in, london,
