fr, d, ric, chopin, wrote, 21, nocturnes, for, solo, piano, between, 1827, and, 1846, they, are, generally, considered, among, the, finest, short, solo, works, for, the, instrument, and, hold, an, important, place, in, contemporary, concert, repertoire, although, chopin, did, not, invent, the, nocturne, he, popularized, and, expanded, on, it, building, on, the, form, developed, by, irish, composer, john, field, chopin, s, nocturnes, numbered, 1, to, 18, were, published, during, his, lifetime, in, twos, or, threes, in, the, order, of, composition, however, numbers, 19, and, 20, were, actually, written, first, prior, to, chopin, s, departure, from, poland, but, published, posthumously, number, 21, was, not, originally, entitled, nocturne, at, all, but, since, its, publication, in, 1938, as, such, it, is, generally, included, with, publications, and, recordings, of, the, set, by, the, time, of, chopin, s, birth, in, 1810, john, field, was, already, an, accomplished, composer, eventually, the, young, chopin, became, a, great, admirer, of, field, taking, some, influence, from, the, irish, composer, s, playing, and, composing, technique, chopin, had, composed, five, of, his, nocturnes, before, meeting, field, for, the, first, time, in, his, youth, chopin, was, often, told, that, he, sounded, like, field, who, in, turn, was, later, described, as, sounding, chopinesque, the, composer, friedrich, kalkbrenner, one, of, chopin, s, early, influences, once, inquired, as, to, whether, chopin, was, a, student, of, field, while, chopin, held, field, in, high, respect, and, considered, him, one, of, his, primary, influences, field, had, a, rather, negative, view, of, chopin, s, work, upon, meeting, chopin, and, hearing, his, nocturnes, in, 1832, field, is, said, to, have, described, the, composer, as, a, sickroom, talent, nonetheless, chopin, still, admired, field, and, his, work, and, continued, to, take, inspiration, throughout, his, life, chopin, s, nocturnes, carry, many, similarities, with, those, of, field, while, at, the, same, time, retaining, a, distinct, unique, sound, of, their, own, one, aspect, of, the, nocturne, that, chopin, continued, from, field, is, the, use, of, a, song, like, melody, in, the, right, hand, this, is, one, of, the, most, if, not, the, most, important, features, to, the, nocturne, as, a, whole, the, use, of, the, melody, as, vocals, bestowed, a, greater, emotional, depth, to, the, piece, drawing, the, listener, in, to, a, greater, extent, along, with, the, right, hand, melody, chopin, continued, the, use, of, another, nocturne, necessity, that, of, playing, broken, chords, on, the, left, hand, to, act, as, the, rhythm, under, his, right, handed, vocal, melody, another, technique, used, by, field, and, continued, by, chopin, was, the, more, extensive, use, of, the, pedal, by, using, the, pedal, more, the, music, gains, more, emotional, expression, through, sustained, notes, giving, the, piece, an, aura, of, drama, with, these, main, attributes, of, the, field, nocturne, chopin, was, inspired, and, expanded, upon, them, to, develop, the, chopin, nocturne, one, of, the, greatest, innovations, made, by, chopin, to, the, nocturne, was, his, use, of, a, more, freely, flowing, rhythm, a, technique, based, on, the, classical, music, style, also, chopin, further, developed, the, structure, of, the, nocturne, taking, inspiration, from, the, italian, and, french, opera, arias, as, well, as, the, sonata, form, composer, franz, liszt, even, insisted, that, chopin, s, nocturnes, were, influenced, by, vincenzo, bellini, s, bel, canto, arias, a, statement, affirmed, and, echoed, by, many, in, the, music, world, a, further, innovation, of, chopin, s, was, his, use, of, counterpoint, to, create, tension, in, the, nocturnes, a, method, that, even, further, expanded, the, dramatic, tone, and, feel, of, the, piece, itself, it, was, mainly, through, these, themes, of, operatic, influence, freer, rhythms, and, an, expansion, into, more, complex, structures, and, melodic, playing, that, chopin, made, his, mark, on, the, nocturne, many, think, of, the, chopin, nocturne, as, a, mix, between, the, form, and, structure, of, field, and, the, sound, of, mozart, displaying, a, classic, romantic, influenced, theme, within, the, music, when, first, published, chopin, s, nocturnes, were, met, with, mixed, reactions, from, critics, however, through, time, many, who, had, initially, been, displeased, with, the, nocturnes, found, themselves, retracting, previous, criticisms, holding, the, compositions, in, high, regard, while, the, popularity, of, individual, nocturnes, has, varied, considerably, since, chopin, s, death, they, have, retained, a, significant, position, in, piano, repertoire, with, the, op, 9, no, 2, in, e, major, and, the, op, 27, no, 2, in, d, major, perhaps, the, most, enduringly, popular, various, composers, from, both, chopin, s, lifetime, and, later, have, expressed, their, influences, from, his, work, with, nocturnes, such, artists, as, johannes, brahms, and, richard, wagner, display, similar, melodic, techniques, and, styles, in, their, music, to, those, of, chopin, other, composers, such, as, mendelssohn, schumann, and, liszt, described, the, genius, that, lay, within, chopin, s, nocturnes, it, is, clear, that, these, piano, compositions, made, a, noticeable, and, lasting, impact, on, music, and, composition, during, the, romantic, period, the, most, important, later, composer, of, nocturnes, was, gabriel, faur, who, greatly, admired, chopin, and, composed, thirteen, works, in, this, genre, other, later, composers, who, have, written, solo, piano, nocturnes, include, georges, bizet, erik, satie, alexander, scriabin, francis, poulenc, samuel, barber, sergei, rachmaninoff, and, lowell, liebermann
