the, western, concert, flute, is, a, family, of, transverse, side, blown, woodwind, instruments, made, of, metal, or, wood, it, is, the, most, common, variant, of, the, flute, a, musician, who, plays, the, flute, is, called, a, flautist, in, british, english, and, a, flutist, in, american, english, this, type, of, flute, is, used, in, many, ensembles, including, concert, bands, military, bands, marching, bands, orchestras, flute, ensembles, and, occasionally, jazz, bands, and, big, bands, other, flutes, in, this, family, include, the, piccolo, the, alto, flute, and, the, bass, flute, a, large, repertory, of, works, has, been, composed, for, flute, the, flute, is, one, of, the, oldest, and, most, widely, used, wind, instruments, the, precursors, of, the, modern, concert, flute, were, keyless, wooden, transverse, flutes, similar, to, modern, fifes, these, were, later, modified, to, include, between, one, and, eight, keys, for, chromatic, notes, six, finger, d, is, the, most, common, pitch, for, keyless, wooden, transverse, flutes, which, continue, to, be, used, today, particularly, in, irish, traditional, music, and, historically, informed, performances, of, early, music, including, baroque, during, the, baroque, era, the, traditional, transverse, flute, was, redesigned, and, eventually, developed, as, the, modern, traverso, throughout, the, 11th, 12th, and, 13th, centuries, transverse, flutes, were, very, uncommon, in, europe, with, the, recorder, being, more, prominent, the, transverse, flute, arrived, in, europe, from, asia, via, the, byzantine, empire, where, it, migrated, to, germany, and, france, these, flutes, became, known, as, german, flutes, to, distinguish, them, from, others, such, as, the, recorder, the, flute, became, used, in, court, music, along, with, the, viol, and, was, used, in, secular, music, although, only, in, france, and, germany, it, would, not, spread, to, the, rest, of, europe, for, nearly, a, century, the, first, literary, appearance, of, the, transverse, flute, was, made, in, 1285, by, adenet, le, roi, in, a, list, of, instruments, he, played, after, this, a, period, of, 70, years, follows, in, which, few, references, to, the, flute, are, found, beginning, in, the, 1470s, a, military, revival, in, europe, led, to, a, revival, in, the, flute, the, swiss, army, used, flutes, for, signalling, and, this, helped, the, flute, spread, to, all, of, europe, in, the, late, 16th, century, flutes, began, to, appear, in, court, and, theatre, music, predecessors, of, the, orchestra, and, the, first, flute, solos, following, the, 16th, century, court, music, flutes, began, appearing, in, chamber, ensembles, these, flutes, were, often, used, as, the, tenor, voice, however, flutes, varied, greatly, in, size, and, range, this, made, transposition, necessary, which, led, flautists, to, use, guidonian, hexachords, used, by, singers, and, other, musicians, since, their, introduction, in, the, 11th, century, to, transpose, music, more, easily, during, the, 16th, and, early, 17th, centuries, in, europe, the, transverse, flute, was, available, in, several, sizes, in, effect, forming, a, consort, in, much, the, same, way, recorders, and, other, instruments, were, used, in, consorts, at, this, stage, the, transverse, flute, was, usually, made, in, one, section, or, two, for, the, larger, sizes, and, had, a, cylindrical, bore, as, a, result, this, flute, had, a, rather, soft, sound, and, was, used, primarily, in, the, soft, consort, during, the, baroque, period, the, transverse, flute, was, redesigned, now, often, called, the, traverso, from, the, italian, it, was, made, in, three, or, four, sections, or, joints, the, head, upper, body, lower, body, and, foot, joint, additionally, the, traverso, was, made, with, a, conical, bore, from, the, head, joint, down, this, conical, bore, design, gave, the, flute, a, wider, range, and, more, penetrating, sound, without, sacrificing, the, softer, expressive, qualities, the, head, joint, of, the, traverso, contains, one, embouchure, hole, across, which, air, is, blown, additionally, the, two, body, pieces, upper, body, and, lower, body, each, contain, three, equally, sized, finger, holes, there, is, one, key, on, the, baroque, flute, and, it, is, on, the, foot, joint, this, key, is, usually, made, out, of, metal, the, traverso, was, made, with, a, variety, of, materials, including, various, types, of, wood, most, often, boxwood, as, well, as, ivory, and, metal, while, very, few, flutes, remain, from, the, renaissance, and, medieval, eras, many, baroque, flutes, have, been, preserved, the, role, of, the, flute, began, to, change, as, well, during, the, renaissance, and, medieval, eras, the, flute, was, often, only, used, in, ensembles, and, group, performances, with, the, onset, of, the, baroque, era, the, traverso, began, to, take, on, a, role, as, a, soloist, in, the, baroque, era, composers, began, to, write, more, music, for, the, flute, such, as, operas, ballets, chamber, music, and, even, solos, the, first, written, work, for, the, solo, traverso, was, a, piece, written, by, michael, de, la, barre, entitled, pi, ces, pour, la, flute, traversiere, avec, la, basse, continue, in, 1702, other, notable, baroque, flute, composers, include, praetorius, sch, tz, rebill, quantz, j, s, bach, telemann, blavet, vivaldi, hotteterre, handel, and, frederick, the, great, aside, from, the, composition, of, new, music, several, books, were, published, during, this, time, that, dove, into, the, study, of, the, baroque, flute, in, 1707, jacques, martin, hotteterre, wrote, the, first, method, book, on, playing, the, flute, principes, de, la, fl, te, traversi, re, the, 1730s, brought, an, increase, in, operatic, and, chamber, music, feature, of, flutes, the, end, of, this, era, found, the, publication, of, essay, of, a, method, of, playing, the, transverse, flute, by, quantz, when, compared, to, the, modern, flute, the, baroque, flute, requires, less, airflow, and, produces, much, softer, mellower, sounds, often, blending, in, with, other, instruments, in, the, orchestra, additionally, when, compared, to, the, modern, flute, the, baroque, flute, requires, the, player, to, adjust, with, each, note, in, order, to, make, sure, it, is, in, tune, more, adjustments, are, needed, when, playing, notes, outside, of, the, d, major, scale, the, flutist, can, change, this, pitch, through, small, adjustments, in, the, mouth, and, by, turning, the, flute, towards, or, away, from, the, player, this, need, for, continued, adjustment, was, alleviated, with, the, creation, of, more, modern, flutes, with, the, onset, of, the, romantic, era, flutes, began, to, lose, favor, symphony, orchestras, rather, featured, brass, and, strings, however, the, 21st, century, has, brought, a, rise, in, the, popularity, of, the, baroque, flute, most, notably, led, by, flutist, barthold, kuijken, and, others, such, as, frans, bruggen, emi, ferguson, peter, holtslag, these, baroque, flutists, perform, in, popular, baroque, orchestras, that, travel, the, world, playing, music, using, baroque, instruments, and, performance, techniques, in, the, nineteenth, century, the, great, flautist, composer, acoustician, and, silversmith, theobald, boehm, began, to, make, flutes, keys, were, added, to, the, flute, and, the, taper, was, changed, to, strengthen, its, lower, register, the, dimensions, and, key, system, of, the, modern, western, concert, flute, and, its, close, relatives, are, strongly, influenced, by, boehm, s, design, which, he, patented, in, 1847, minor, additions, to, and, variations, on, his, key, system, are, common, but, the, acoustical, structure, of, the, tube, remains, almost, exactly, as, he, designed, it, major, innovations, were, the, change, to, metal, instead, of, wood, large, straight, tube, bore, parabolic, tapered, headjoint, bore, very, large, tone, holes, covered, by, keys, and, the, linked, key, system, which, simplified, fingering, somewhat, the, most, substantial, departures, from, boehm, s, original, description, are, the, universal, elimination, of, the, crutch, for, the, left, hand, and, almost, universal, adoption, of, briccialdi, s, thumb, key, mechanism, and, a, closed, standing, g, key, over, an, additional, g, tone, hole, boehm, s, key, system, with, minor, variations, remains, regarded, as, the, most, effective, system, of, any, modern, woodwind, allowing, trained, instrumentalists, to, perform, with, facility, and, extraordinary, velocity, and, brilliance, in, all, keys, the, modern, flute, has, three, octaves, plus, c, 7, c, 7, d, 7, in, the, fourth, octave, many, modern, composers, used, the, high, d, 7, and, while, such, extremes, are, not, commonly, used, the, modern, flute, can, produce, even, higher, notes, the, meyer, flute, was, a, popular, flute, in, the, mid, 19th, century, including, and, derived, from, the, instruments, built, by, h, f, meyer, from, 1850, to, the, late, 1890s, it, could, have, up, to, 12, keys, and, was, built, with, head, joints, of, either, metal, lined, ivory, or, wood, the, final, form, was, a, combination, of, a, traditional, keyed, flute, and, the, viennese, flute, and, became, the, most, common, throughout, europe, and, america, this, form, had, 12, keys, a, body, of, wood, a, head, joint, of, metal, and, ivory, and, was, common, at, the, end, of, the, century, quite, at, the, opposite, end, of, the, spectrum, in, terms, of, the, complexity, of, the, key, system, developed, by, boehm, was, the, giorgi, flute, an, advanced, form, of, the, ancient, holed, flute, patented, in, 1897, the, giorgi, flute, was, designed, without, any, mechanical, keys, though, the, patent, allows, for, the, addition, of, keys, as, options, giorgi, enabled, the, performer, to, play, equally, true, in, all, musical, keys, as, does, the, boehm, system, giorgi, flutes, are, now, rarities, found, in, museums, and, private, collections, the, underlying, principles, of, both, flute, patterns, are, virtually, identical, with, tone, holes, spaced, as, required, to, produce, a, fully, chromatic, scale, the, player, by, opening, and, closing, holes, adjusts, the, effective, length, of, the, tube, and, thus, the, rate, of, oscillation, which, defines, the, audible, pitch, in, the, 1950s, albert, cooper, modified, the, boehm, flute, to, make, playing, modern, music, easier, the, flute, was, tuned, to, a440, and, the, embouchure, hole, was, cut, in, a, new, way, to, change, the, timbre, these, flutes, became, the, most, used, flutes, by, professionals, and, amateurs, in, the, 1980s, johan, br, gger, modified, the, boehm, flute, by, fixing, two, major, problems, that, had, existed, for, nearly, 150, years, maladjustment, between, certain, keys, and, problems, between, the, g, and, b, keys, the, result, was, non, rotating, shafts, which, gave, a, quieter, sound, and, less, friction, on, moving, parts, also, the, modifications, allowed, for, springs, to, be, adjusted, individually, and, the, flute, was, strengthened, the, br, gger, flute, is, only, made, by, the, brannen, brothers, and, miyazawa, flutes, the, flute, is, a, transverse, or, side, blown, woodwind, instrument, that, is, closed, at, the, blown, end, it, is, played, by, blowing, a, stream, of, air, over, the, embouchure, hole, the, pitch, is, changed, by, opening, or, closing, keys, that, cover, circular, tone, holes, there, are, typically, 16, tone, holes, opening, and, closing, the, holes, produces, higher, and, lower, pitches, higher, pitches, can, also, be, achieved, through, over, blowing, like, most, other, woodwind, instruments, the, direction, and, intensity, of, the, airstream, also, affects, the, pitch, timbre, and, dynamics, the, piccolo, is, also, commonly, used, in, western, orchestras, and, bands, alto, flutes, pitched, a, fourth, below, the, standard, flute, and, bass, flutes, an, octave, below, are, also, used, occasionally, the, standard, concert, flute, also, called, c, flute, boehm, flute, silver, flute, or, simply, flute, is, pitched, in, c, and, has, a, potential, range, of, three, and, a, half, octaves, starting, from, the, note, c, 4, middle, c, the, flute, s, highest, pitch, is, usually, given, as, c, 7, or, in, more, modern, flute, literature, d, 7, more, experienced, flautists, are, able, to, reach, up, to, f, 7, but, notes, above, d, 7, are, difficult, to, produce, modern, flutes, may, have, a, longer, foot, joint, a, b, footjoint, with, an, extra, key, to, reach, b, 3, from, high, to, low, the, members, of, the, concert, flute, family, include, the, following, each, of, the, above, instruments, has, its, own, range, the, piccolo, reads, music, in, c, like, the, standard, flute, but, sounds, one, octave, higher, the, alto, flute, is, in, the, key, of, g, and, the, low, register, extends, to, the, g, below, middle, c, its, highest, note, is, a, high, g, 4, ledger, lines, above, the, treble, staff, the, bass, flute, is, an, octave, lower, than, the, concert, flute, and, the, contrabass, flute, is, an, octave, lower, than, the, bass, flute, less, commonly, seen, flutes, include, the, treble, flute, in, g, pitched, one, octave, higher, than, the, alto, flute, soprano, flute, between, the, treble, and, concert, and, tenor, flute, or, fl, te, d, amour, in, b, a, or, a, pitched, between, the, concert, and, alto, flutes, pitched, lower, than, the, bass, flute, were, developed, in, the, 20th, century, these, include, the, contra, alto, flute, pitched, in, g, one, octave, below, the, alto, the, subcontrabass, flute, pitched, in, g, two, octaves, below, the, alto, and, the, double, contrabass, flute, pitched, in, c, one, octave, below, the, contrabass, the, flute, sizes, other, than, the, concert, flute, and, piccolo, are, sometimes, called, harmony, flutes, concert, flutes, have, three, parts, the, headjoint, body, and, foot, joint, the, headjoint, is, sealed, by, a, cork, or, plug, that, may, be, made, out, of, various, plastics, metals, or, less, commonly, woods, it, is, possible, to, make, fine, adjustments, to, tuning, by, adjusting, the, headjoint, cork, but, usually, it, is, left, in, the, factory, recommended, position, around, 17, 3, mm, 0, 68, in, from, the, centre, of, the, embouchure, hole, for, best, scale, gross, temporary, adjustments, of, pitch, are, made, by, moving, the, headjoint, in, and, out, of, the, headjoint, tenon, the, flautist, makes, fine, or, rapid, adjustments, of, pitch, and, timbre, by, adjusting, the, embouchure, and, or, position, of, the, flute, in, relation, to, himself, or, herself, i, e, side, and, out, the, head, joint, tube, is, tapered, slightly, towards, the, closed, end, theobald, boehm, described, the, shape, of, the, taper, as, parabolic, examination, of, his, flutes, did, not, reveal, a, true, parabolic, curve, but, the, taper, is, more, complex, than, a, truncated, cone, the, head, joint, is, the, most, difficult, part, to, construct, because, the, lip, plate, and, tone, hole, have, critical, dimensions, edges, and, angles, that, vary, slightly, between, manufacturers, and, in, individual, flutes, especially, where, they, are, handmade, head, joint, geometry, appears, particularly, critical, to, acoustic, performance, and, tone, but, there, is, no, clear, consensus, on, a, particular, shape, amongst, manufacturers, acoustic, impedance, of, the, embouchure, hole, appears, to, be, the, most, critical, parameter, critical, variables, affecting, this, acoustic, impedance, include, chimney, length, the, hole, between, lip, plate, and, head, tube, chimney, diameter, and, radiuses, or, curvature, of, the, ends, of, the, chimney, generally, the, shorter, the, hole, the, more, quickly, a, flute, can, be, played, the, longer, the, hole, the, more, complex, the, tone, finding, a, particularly, good, example, of, a, flute, is, dependent, on, play, testing, head, joint, upgrades, are, usually, suggested, as, a, way, to, improve, the, tone, of, an, instrument, cheaper, student, models, may, be, purchased, with, a, curved, head, to, allow, younger, children, with, shorter, arms, to, play, them, less, expensive, flutes, are, usually, constructed, of, brass, polished, and, then, silver, plated, and, lacquered, to, prevent, corrosion, or, silver, plated, nickel, silver, nickel, bronze, bell, metal, 63, cu, 29, zn, 5, 5, ni, 1, 25, ag, 75, pb, alloyed, as, sb, fe, sn, flutes, that, are, more, expensive, are, usually, made, of, more, precious, metals, most, commonly, solid, sterling, silver, 92, 5, silver, and, other, alloys, including, french, silver, 95, silver, 5, copper, coin, silver, 90, silver, or, britannia, silver, 95, 8, silver, it, is, reported, that, old, louis, lot, french, flutes, have, a, particular, sound, by, nature, of, their, specific, silver, alloy, gold, silver, flutes, are, even, more, expensive, they, can, be, either, gold, on, the, inside, and, silver, on, the, outside, or, vice, versa, all, gold, and, all, platinum, flutes, also, exist, flutes, can, also, be, made, out, of, wood, with, african, blackwood, grenadilla, or, dalbergia, melanoxylon, being, the, most, common, today, cocuswood, was, formerly, used, but, this, is, hard, to, obtain, today, wooden, flutes, were, far, more, common, before, the, early, 20th, century, the, silver, flute, was, introduced, by, boehm, in, 1847, but, did, not, become, common, until, later, in, the, 20th, century, william, s, haynes, a, flute, manufacturer, in, boston, massachusetts, united, states, told, georges, barr, re, that, in, 1905, he, made, one, silver, flute, to, every, 100, wooden, flutes, but, in, the, 1930s, he, made, one, wooden, flute, to, every, 100, silver, flutes, unusual, tubing, materials, include, glass, carbon, fiber, and, palladium, professionals, tend, to, play, more, expensive, flutes, however, the, idea, that, different, materials, can, significantly, affect, sound, quality, is, under, some, contention, and, some, argue, that, different, metals, make, less, difference, in, sound, quality, than, different, flautists, playing, the, same, flute, even, verne, q, powell, a, flute, maker, admitted, in, needed, a, gold, flute, or, a, gold, lip, that, as, far, as, tone, is, concerned, i, contend, that, 90, percent, of, it, is, the, man, behind, the, flute, most, metal, flutes, are, made, of, alloys, that, contain, significant, amounts, of, copper, or, silver, these, alloys, are, biostatic, because, of, the, oligodynamic, effect, and, thus, suppress, growth, of, unpleasant, molds, fungi, and, bacteria, good, quality, flutes, are, designed, to, prevent, or, reduce, galvanic, corrosion, between, the, tube, and, key, mechanism, tone, holes, are, stopped, by, pads, constructed, of, fish, skin, gold, beater, s, skin, over, felt, or, silicone, rubber, on, some, very, low, cost, or, ruggedized, flutes, accurate, shimming, of, pads, on, professional, flutes, to, ensure, pad, sealing, is, very, demanding, of, technician, time, in, the, traditional, method, pads, are, seated, on, paper, shims, sealed, with, shellac, a, recent, development, is, precision, pads, fitted, by, a, factory, trained, technician, student, flutes, are, more, likely, to, have, pads, bedded, in, thicker, materials, like, wax, or, hot, melt, glue, larger, sized, closed, hole, pads, are, also, held, in, with, screws, and, washers, synthetic, pads, appear, more, water, resistant, but, may, be, susceptible, to, mechanical, failure, cracking, the, keys, can, be, made, of, the, same, or, different, metals, as, the, tubing, nickel, silver, keys, with, silver, tubing, for, example, flute, key, axles, or, steels, are, typically, made, of, drill, rod, or, stainless, steel, these, mechanisms, need, periodic, disassembly, cleaning, and, relubrication, typically, performed, by, a, trained, technician, for, optimal, performance, james, phelan, a, flute, maker, and, engineer, recommends, single, weight, motor, oil, sae, 20, or, 30, as, a, key, lubricant, demonstrating, superior, performance, and, reduced, wear, in, preference, to, commercial, key, oils, the, keywork, is, constructed, by, lost, wax, castings, and, machining, with, mounting, posts, and, ribs, silver, soldered, to, the, tube, on, the, best, flutes, the, castings, are, forged, to, increase, their, strength, most, keys, have, needle, springs, made, of, phosphor, bronze, stainless, steel, beryllium, copper, or, a, gold, alloy, the, b, thumb, keys, typically, have, flat, springs, phosphor, bronze, is, by, far, the, most, common, material, for, needle, springs, because, it, is, relatively, inexpensive, makes, a, good, spring, and, is, resistant, to, corrosion, unfortunately, it, is, prone, to, metal, fatigue, stainless, steel, also, makes, a, good, spring, and, is, resistant, to, corrosion, gold, springs, are, found, mostly, in, high, end, flutes, because, of, gold, s, cost, an, early, version, of, antonio, vivaldi, s, la, tempesta, di, mare, flute, concerto, was, possibly, written, around, 1713, 1716, and, would, thus, have, been, the, first, concerto, for, the, instrument, as, well, as, the, earliest, scoring, of, a, high, f, 6, a, problematic, note, for, the, baroque, flute, of, that, period, flutes, were, rarely, used, in, early, jazz, drummer, and, bandleader, chick, webb, was, among, the, first, to, use, flutes, in, jazz, beginning, in, the, late, 1930s, frank, wess, was, among, the, first, noteworthy, flautists, in, jazz, in, the, 1940s, since, theobald, boehm, s, fingering, is, used, in, saxophones, as, well, as, in, concert, flutes, many, flute, players, double, on, saxophone, for, jazz, and, small, ensembles, and, vice, versa, since, 1950, a, number, of, notable, performers, have, used, flutes, in, jazz, frank, foster, and, frank, wess, basie, band, jerome, richardson, jones, lewis, big, band, and, lew, tabackin, akiyoshi, tabackin, big, band, used, flutes, in, big, band, contexts, in, small, band, contexts, notable, performers, included, bud, shank, herbie, mann, yusef, lateef, m, lanie, de, biasio, joe, farrell, rahsaan, roland, kirk, charles, lloyd, hubert, laws, and, moe, koffman, several, modal, jazz, and, avant, garde, jazz, performers, have, utilized, the, flute, including, eric, dolphy, sam, rivers, and, james, spaulding, jethro, tull, is, probably, the, best, known, rock, group, to, make, regular, use, of, the, flute, which, is, played, by, its, frontman, ian, anderson, an, alto, flute, is, briefly, heard, in, the, beatles, song, you, ve, got, to, hide, your, love, away, played, by, john, scott, the, beatles, would, later, feature, a, flute, more, prominently, in, their, single, penny, lane, other, groups, that, have, used, the, flute, in, pop, and, rock, songs, include, the, moody, blues, chicago, australian, groups, men, at, work, and, king, gizzard, the, lizard, wizard, the, canadian, progressive, rock, group, harmonium, dutch, bands, focus, and, early, golden, earring, and,
