web, design, encompasses, many, different, skills, and, disciplines, in, the, production, and, maintenance, of, websites, the, different, areas, of, web, design, include, web, graphic, design, user, interface, design, ui, design, authoring, including, standardised, code, and, proprietary, software, user, experience, design, ux, design, and, search, engine, optimization, often, many, individuals, will, work, in, teams, covering, different, aspects, of, the, design, process, although, some, designers, will, cover, them, all, the, term, web, design, is, normally, used, to, describe, the, design, process, relating, to, the, front, end, client, side, design, of, a, website, including, writing, markup, web, design, partially, overlaps, web, engineering, in, the, broader, scope, of, web, development, web, designers, are, expected, to, have, an, awareness, of, usability, and, be, up, to, date, with, web, accessibility, guidelines, although, web, design, has, a, fairly, recent, history, it, can, be, linked, to, other, areas, such, as, graphic, design, user, experience, and, multimedia, arts, but, is, more, aptly, seen, from, a, technological, standpoint, it, has, become, a, large, part, of, people, s, everyday, lives, it, is, hard, to, imagine, the, internet, without, animated, graphics, different, styles, of, typography, backgrounds, videos, and, music, the, web, was, announced, on, august, 6, 1991, in, november, 1992, cern, was, the, first, website, to, go, live, on, the, world, wide, web, during, this, period, websites, were, structured, by, using, the, table, tag, which, created, numbers, on, the, website, eventually, web, designers, were, able, to, find, their, way, around, it, to, create, more, structures, and, formats, in, early, history, the, structure, of, the, websites, was, fragile, and, hard, to, contain, so, it, became, very, difficult, to, use, them, in, november, 1993, aliweb, was, the, first, ever, search, engine, to, be, created, archie, like, indexing, for, the, web, in, 1989, whilst, working, at, cern, tim, berners, lee, proposed, to, create, a, global, hypertext, project, which, later, became, known, as, the, world, wide, web, from, 1991, to, 1993, the, world, wide, web, was, born, text, only, html, pages, could, be, viewed, using, a, simple, line, mode, web, browser, in, 1993, marc, andreessen, and, eric, bina, created, the, mosaic, browser, at, the, time, there, were, multiple, browsers, however, the, majority, of, them, were, unix, based, and, naturally, text, heavy, there, had, been, no, integrated, approach, to, graphic, design, elements, such, as, images, or, sounds, the, mosaic, browser, broke, this, mould, the, w3c, was, created, in, october, 1994, to, lead, the, world, wide, web, to, its, full, potential, by, developing, common, protocols, that, promote, its, evolution, and, ensure, its, interoperability, this, discouraged, any, one, company, from, monopolizing, a, proprietary, browser, and, programming, language, which, could, have, altered, the, effect, of, the, world, wide, web, as, a, whole, the, w3c, continues, to, set, standards, which, can, today, be, seen, with, javascript, and, other, languages, in, 1994, andreessen, formed, mosaic, communications, corp, that, later, became, known, as, netscape, communications, the, netscape, 0, 9, browser, netscape, created, its, html, tags, without, regard, to, the, traditional, standards, process, for, example, netscape, 1, 1, included, tags, for, changing, background, colours, and, formatting, text, with, tables, on, web, pages, from, 1996, to, 1999, the, browser, wars, began, as, microsoft, and, netscape, fought, for, ultimate, browser, dominance, during, this, time, there, were, many, new, technologies, in, the, field, notably, cascading, style, sheets, javascript, and, dynamic, html, on, the, whole, the, browser, competition, did, lead, to, many, positive, creations, and, helped, web, design, evolve, at, a, rapid, pace, in, 1996, microsoft, released, its, first, competitive, browser, which, was, complete, with, its, features, and, html, tags, it, was, also, the, first, browser, to, support, style, sheets, which, at, the, time, was, seen, as, an, obscure, authoring, technique, and, is, today, an, important, aspect, of, web, design, the, html, markup, for, tables, was, originally, intended, for, displaying, tabular, data, however, designers, quickly, realized, the, potential, of, using, html, tables, for, creating, complex, multi, column, layouts, that, were, otherwise, not, possible, at, this, time, as, design, and, good, aesthetics, seemed, to, take, precedence, over, good, markup, structure, little, attention, was, paid, to, semantics, and, web, accessibility, html, sites, were, limited, in, their, design, options, even, more, so, with, earlier, versions, of, html, to, create, complex, designs, many, web, designers, had, to, use, complicated, table, structures, or, even, use, blank, spacer, gif, images, to, stop, empty, table, cells, from, collapsing, css, was, introduced, in, december, 1996, by, the, w3c, to, support, presentation, and, layout, this, allowed, html, code, to, be, semantic, rather, than, both, semantic, and, presentational, and, improved, web, accessibility, see, tableless, web, design, in, 1996, flash, originally, known, as, futuresplash, was, developed, at, the, time, the, flash, content, development, tool, was, relatively, simple, compared, to, now, using, basic, layout, and, drawing, tools, a, limited, precursor, to, actionscript, and, a, timeline, but, it, enabled, web, designers, to, go, beyond, the, point, of, html, animated, gifs, and, javascript, however, because, flash, required, a, plug, in, many, web, developers, avoided, using, it, for, fear, of, limiting, their, market, share, due, to, lack, of, compatibility, instead, designers, reverted, to, gif, animations, if, they, did, not, forego, using, motion, graphics, altogether, and, javascript, for, widgets, but, the, benefits, of, flash, made, it, popular, enough, among, specific, target, markets, to, eventually, work, its, way, to, the, vast, majority, of, browsers, and, powerful, enough, to, be, used, to, develop, entire, sites, in, 1998, netscape, released, netscape, communicator, code, under, an, open, source, licence, enabling, thousands, of, developers, to, participate, in, improving, the, software, however, these, developers, decided, to, start, a, standard, for, the, web, from, scratch, which, guided, the, development, of, the, open, source, browser, and, soon, expanded, to, a, complete, application, platform, the, web, standards, project, was, formed, and, promoted, browser, compliance, with, html, and, css, standards, programs, like, acid1, acid2, and, acid3, were, created, in, order, to, test, browsers, for, compliance, with, web, standards, in, 2000, internet, explorer, was, released, for, mac, which, was, the, first, browser, that, fully, supported, html, 4, 01, and, css, 1, it, was, also, the, first, browser, to, fully, support, the, png, image, format, by, 2001, after, a, campaign, by, microsoft, to, popularize, internet, explorer, internet, explorer, had, reached, 96, of, web, browser, usage, share, which, signified, the, end, of, the, first, browser, wars, as, internet, explorer, had, no, real, competition, since, the, start, of, the, 21st, century, the, web, has, become, more, and, more, integrated, into, people, s, lives, as, this, has, happened, the, technology, of, the, web, has, also, moved, on, there, have, also, been, significant, changes, in, the, way, people, use, and, access, the, web, and, this, has, changed, how, sites, are, designed, since, the, end, of, the, browsers, wars, new, browsers, have, been, released, many, of, these, are, open, source, meaning, that, they, tend, to, have, faster, development, and, are, more, supportive, of, new, standards, the, new, options, are, considered, by, many, to, be, better, than, microsoft, s, internet, explorer, the, w3c, has, released, new, standards, for, html, html5, and, css, css3, as, well, as, new, javascript, api, s, each, as, a, new, but, individual, standard, while, the, term, html5, is, only, used, to, refer, to, the, new, version, of, html, and, some, of, the, javascript, apis, it, has, become, common, to, use, it, to, refer, to, the, entire, suite, of, new, standards, html5, css3, and, javascript, with, the, advancements, in, 3g, and, lte, internet, coverage, a, significant, portion, of, website, traffic, shifted, to, mobile, devices, this, shift, influenced, the, web, design, industry, steering, it, towards, a, minimalist, lighter, and, more, simplistic, style, the, mobile, first, approach, emerged, as, a, result, emphasizing, the, creation, of, website, designs, that, prioritize, mobile, oriented, layouts, first, before, adapting, them, to, larger, screen, dimensions, web, designers, use, a, variety, of, different, tools, depending, on, what, part, of, the, production, process, they, are, involved, in, these, tools, are, updated, over, time, by, newer, standards, and, software, but, the, principles, behind, them, remain, the, same, web, designers, use, both, vector, and, raster, graphics, editors, to, create, web, formatted, imagery, or, design, prototypes, a, website, can, be, created, using, wysiwyg, website, builder, software, or, content, management, system, or, the, individual, web, pages, can, be, hand, coded, in, just, the, same, manner, as, the, first, web, pages, were, created, other, tools, web, designers, might, use, include, markup, validators, and, other, testing, tools, for, usability, and, accessibility, to, ensure, their, websites, meet, web, accessibility, guidelines, one, popular, tool, in, web, design, is, ux, design, it, is, a, type, of, art, that, designs, products, to, perform, an, accurate, user, background, ux, design, is, very, deep, ux, is, more, than, the, web, it, is, very, independent, and, its, fundamentals, can, be, applied, to, many, other, browsers, or, apps, web, design, is, mostly, based, on, web, based, things, ux, can, overlap, both, web, design, and, design, ux, design, mostly, focuses, on, products, that, are, less, web, based, marketing, and, communication, design, on, a, website, may, identify, what, works, for, its, target, market, this, can, be, an, age, group, or, particular, strand, of, culture, thus, the, designer, may, understand, the, trends, of, its, audience, designers, may, also, understand, the, type, of, website, they, are, designing, meaning, for, example, that, b2b, business, to, business, website, design, considerations, might, differ, greatly, from, a, consumer, targeted, website, such, as, a, retail, or, entertainment, website, careful, consideration, might, be, made, to, ensure, that, the, aesthetics, or, overall, design, of, a, site, do, not, clash, with, the, clarity, and, accuracy, of, the, content, or, the, ease, of, web, navigation, especially, on, a, b2b, website, designers, may, also, consider, the, reputation, of, the, owner, or, business, the, site, is, representing, to, make, sure, they, are, portrayed, favorably, web, designers, normally, oversee, all, the, websites, that, are, made, on, how, they, work, or, operate, on, things, they, constantly, are, updating, and, changing, everything, on, websites, behind, the, scenes, all, the, elements, they, do, are, text, photos, graphics, and, layout, of, the, web, before, beginning, work, on, a, website, web, designers, normally, set, an, appointment, with, their, clients, to, discuss, layout, colour, graphics, and, design, web, designers, spend, the, majority, of, their, time, designing, websites, and, making, sure, the, speed, is, right, web, designers, typically, engage, in, testing, and, working, marketing, and, communicating, with, other, designers, about, laying, out, the, websites, and, finding, the, right, elements, for, the, websites, user, understanding, of, the, content, of, a, website, often, depends, on, user, understanding, of, how, the, website, works, this, is, part, of, the, user, experience, design, user, experience, is, related, to, layout, clear, instructions, and, labeling, on, a, website, how, well, a, user, understands, how, they, can, interact, on, a, site, may, also, depend, on, the, interactive, design, of, the, site, if, a, user, perceives, the, usefulness, of, the, website, they, are, more, likely, to, continue, using, it, users, who, are, skilled, and, well, versed, in, website, use, may, find, a, more, distinctive, yet, less, intuitive, or, less, user, friendly, website, interface, useful, nonetheless, however, users, with, less, experience, are, less, likely, to, see, the, advantages, or, usefulness, of, a, less, intuitive, website, interface, this, drives, the, trend, for, a, more, universal, user, experience, and, ease, of, access, to, accommodate, as, many, users, as, possible, regardless, of, user, skill, much, of, the, user, experience, design, and, interactive, design, are, considered, in, the, user, interface, design, advanced, interactive, functions, may, require, plug, ins, if, not, advanced, coding, language, skills, choosing, whether, or, not, to, use, interactivity, that, requires, plug, ins, is, a, critical, decision, in, user, experience, design, if, the, plug, in, doesn, t, come, pre, installed, with, most, browsers, there, s, a, risk, that, the, user, will, have, neither, the, know, how, nor, the, patience, to, install, a, plug, in, just, to, access, the, content, if, the, function, requires, advanced, coding, language, skills, it, may, be, too, costly, in, either, time, or, money, to, code, compared, to, the, amount, of, enhancement, the, function, will, add, to, the, user, experience, there, s, also, a, risk, that, advanced, interactivity, may, be, incompatible, with, older, browsers, or, hardware, configurations, publishing, a, function, that, doesn, t, work, reliably, is, potentially, worse, for, the, user, experience, than, making, no, attempt, it, depends, on, the, target, audience, if, it, s, likely, to, be, needed, or, worth, any, risks, progressive, enhancement, is, a, strategy, in, web, design, that, puts, emphasis, on, web, content, first, allowing, everyone, to, access, the, basic, content, and, functionality, of, a, web, page, whilst, users, with, additional, browser, features, or, faster, internet, access, receive, the, enhanced, version, instead, in, practice, this, means, serving, content, through, html, and, applying, styling, and, animation, through, css, to, the, technically, possible, extent, then, applying, further, enhancements, through, javascript, pages, text, is, loaded, immediately, through, the, html, source, code, rather, than, having, to, wait, for, javascript, to, initiate, and, load, the, content, subsequently, which, allows, content, to, be, readable, with, minimum, loading, time, and, bandwidth, and, through, text, based, browsers, and, maximizes, backwards, compatibility, as, an, example, mediawiki, based, sites, including, wikipedia, use, progressive, enhancement, as, they, remain, usable, while, javascript, and, even, css, is, deactivated, as, pages, content, is, included, in, the, page, s, html, source, code, whereas, counter, example, everipedia, relies, on, javascript, to, load, pages, content, subsequently, a, blank, page, appears, with, javascript, deactivated, part, of, the, user, interface, design, is, affected, by, the, quality, of, the, page, layout, for, example, a, designer, may, consider, whether, the, site, s, page, layout, should, remain, consistent, on, different, pages, when, designing, the, layout, page, pixel, width, may, also, be, considered, vital, for, aligning, objects, in, the, layout, design, the, most, popular, fixed, width, websites, generally, have, the, same, set, width, to, match, the, current, most, popular, browser, window, at, the, current, most, popular, screen, resolution, on, the, current, most, popular, monitor, size, most, pages, are, also, center, aligned, for, concerns, of, aesthetics, on, larger, screens, fluid, layouts, increased, in, popularity, around, 2000, to, allow, the, browser, to, make, user, specific, layout, adjustments, to, fluid, layouts, based, on, the, details, of, the, reader, s, screen, window, size, font, size, relative, to, window, etc, they, grew, as, an, alternative, to, html, table, based, layouts, and, grid, based, design, in, both, page, layout, design, principles, and, in, coding, technique, but, were, very, slow, to, be, adopted, this, was, due, to, considerations, of, screen, reading, devices, and, varying, windows, sizes, which, designers, have, no, control, over, accordingly, a, design, may, be, broken, down, into, units, sidebars, content, blocks, embedded, advertising, areas, navigation, areas, that, are, sent, to, the, browser, and, which, will, be, fitted, into, the, display, window, by, the, browser, as, best, it, can, although, such, a, display, may, often, change, the, relative, position, of, major, content, units, sidebars, may, be, displaced, below, body, text, rather, than, to, the, side, of, it, this, is, a, more, flexible, display, than, a, hard, coded, grid, based, layout, that, doesn, t, fit, the, device, window, in, particular, the, relative, position, of, content, blocks, may, change, while, leaving, the, content, within, the, block, unaffected, this, also, minimizes, the, user, s, need, to, horizontally, scroll, the, page, responsive, web, design, is, a, newer, approach, based, on, css3, and, a, deeper, level, of, per, device, specification, within, the, page, s, style, sheet, through, an, enhanced, use, of, the, css, media, rule, in, march, 2018, google, announced, they, would, be, rolling, out, mobile, first, indexing, sites, using, responsive, design, are, well, placed, to, ensure, they, meet, this, new, approach, web, designers, may, choose, to, limit, the, variety, of, website, typefaces, to, only, a, few, which, are, of, a, similar, style, instead, of, using, a, wide, range, of, typefaces, or, type, styles, most, browsers, recognize, a, specific, number, of, safe, fonts, which, designers, mainly, use, in, order, to, avoid, complications, font, downloading, was, later, included, in, the, css3, fonts, module, and, has, since, been, implemented, in, safari, 3, 1, opera, 10, and, mozilla, firefox, 3, 5, this, has, subsequently, increased, interest, in, web, typography, as, well, as, the, usage, of, font, downloading, most, site, layouts, incorporate, negative, space, to, break, the, text, up, into, paragraphs, and, also, avoid, center, aligned, text, the, page, layout, and, user, interface, may, also, be, affected, by, the, use, of, motion, graphics, the, choice, of, whether, or, not, to, use, motion, graphics, may, depend, on, the, target, market, for, the, website, motion, graphics, may, be, expected, or, at, least, better, received, with, an, entertainment, oriented, website, however, a, website, target, audience, with, a, more, serious, or, formal, interest, such, as, business, community, or, government, might, find, animations, unnecessary, and, distracting, if, only, for, entertainment, or, decoration, purposes, this, doesn, t, mean, that, more, serious, content, couldn, t, be, enhanced, with, animated, or, video, presentations, that, is, relevant, to, the, content, in, either, case, motion, graphic, design, may, make, the, difference, between, more, effective, visuals, or, distracting, visuals, motion, graphics, that, are, not, initiated, by, the, site, visitor, can, produce, accessibility, issues, the, world, wide, web, consortium, accessibility, standards, require, that, site, visitors, be, able, to, disable, the, animations, website, designers, may, consider, it, to, be, good, practice, to, conform, to, standards, this, is, usually, done, via, a, description, specifying, what, the, element, is, doing, failure, to, conform, to, standards, may, not, make, a, website, unusable, or, error, prone, but, standards, can, relate, to, the, correct, layout, of, pages, for, readability, as, well, as, making, sure, coded, elements, are, closed, appropriately, this, includes, errors, in, code, a, more, organized, layout, for, code, and, making, sure, ids, and, classes, are, identified, properly, poorly, coded, pages, are, sometimes, colloquially, called, tag, soup, validating, via, w3c, can, only, be, done, when, a, correct, doctype, declaration, is, made, which, is, used, to, highlight, errors, in, code, the, system, identifies, the, errors, and, areas, that, do, not, conform, to, web, design, standards, this, information, can, then, be, corrected, by, the, user, there, are, two, ways, websites, are, generated, statically, or, dynamically, a, static, website, stores, a, unique, file, for, every, page, of, a, static, website, each, time, that, page, is, requested, the, same, content, is, returned, this, content, is, created, once, during, the, design, of, the, website, it, is, usually, manually, authored, although, some, sites, use, an, automated, creation, process, similar, to, a, dynamic, website, whose, results, are, stored, long, term, as, completed, pages, these, automatically, created, static, sites, became, more, popular, around, 2015, with, generators, such, as, jekyll, and, adobe, muse, the, benefits, of, a, static, website, are, that, they, were, simpler, to, host, as, their, server, only, needed, to, serve, static, content, not, execute, server, side, scripts, this, required, less, server, administration, and, had, less, chance, of, exposing, security, holes, they, could, also, serve, pages, more, quickly, on, low, cost, server, hardware, this, advantage, became, less, important, as, cheap, web, hosting, expanded, to, also, offer, dynamic, features, and, virtual, servers, offered, high, performance, for, short, intervals, at, low, cost, almost, all, websites, have, some, static, content, as, supporting, assets, such, as, images, and, style, sheets, are, usually, static, even, on, a, website, with, highly, dynamic, pages, dynamic, websites, are, generated, on, the, fly, and, use, server, side, technology, to, generate, web, pages, they, typically, extract, their, content, from, one, or, more, back, end, databases, some, are, database, queries, across, a, relational, database, to, query, a, catalog, or, to, summarise, numeric, information, and, others, may, use, a, document, database, such, as, mongodb, or, nosql, to, store, larger, units, of, content, such, as, blog, posts, or, wiki, articles, in, the, design, process, dynamic, pages, are, often, mocked, up, or, wireframed, using, static, pages, the, skillset, needed, to, develop, dynamic, web, pages, is, much, broader, than, for, a, static, page, involving, server, side, and, database, coding, as, well, as, client, side, interface, design, even, medium, sized, dynamic, projects, are, thus, almost, always, a, team, effort, when, dynamic, web, pages, first, developed, they, were, typically, coded, directly, in, languages, such, as, perl, php, or, asp, some, of, these, notably, php, and, asp, used, a, template, approach, where, a, server, side, page, resembled, the, structure, of, the, completed, client, side, page, and, data, was, inserted, into, places, defined, by, tags, this, was, a, quicker, means, of, development, than, coding, in, a, purely, procedural, coding, language, such, as, perl, both, of, these, approaches, have, now, been, supplanted, for, many, websites, by, higher, level, application, focused, tools, such, as, content, management, systems, these, build, on, top, of, general, purpose, coding, platforms, and, assume, that, a, website, exists, to, offer, content, according, to, one, of, several, well, recognised, models, such, as, a, time, sequenced, blog, a, thematic, magazine, or, news, site, a, wiki, or, a, user, forum, these, tools, make, the, implementation, of, such, a, site, very, easy, and, a, purely, organizational, and, design, based, task, without, requiring, any, coding, editing, the, content, itself, as, well, as, the, template, page, can, be, done, both, by, means, of, the, site, itself, and, with, the, use, of, third, party, software, the, ability, to, edit, all, pages, is, provided, only, to, a, specific, category, of, users, for, example, administrators, or, registered, users, in, some, cases, anonymous, users, are, allowed, to, edit, certain, web, content, which, is, less, frequent, for, example, on, forums, adding, messages, an, example, of, a, site, with, an, anonymous, change, is, wikipedia, the, authors, of, a, research, paper, delve, into, what, makes, technical, communication, effective, they, introduce, a, measurement, method, called, the, communication, coefficient, which, gauges, how, well, complex, technical, concepts, are, communicated, they, specifically, state, three, philosophies, that, they, believe, lead, to, good, technical, communication, the, authors, do, not, give, clear, indication, of, specific, application, however, they, give, a, clear, and, concise, framework, for, effective, technical, communication, in, an, additional, study, regarding, privacy, policies, the, authors, present, an, alternative, to, the, privacy, agreement, they, propose, a, more, visual, user, based, approach, as, opposed, to, the, classic, long, worded, privacy, agreements, such, an, approach, involves, privacy, ratings, that, pertain, to, categories, and, are, clearly, hierarchically, represented, such, a, representation, makes, it, clear, what, information, is, being, shared, and, how, secure, a, website, is, in, a, more, user, friendly, manner, their, results, show, a, generally, positive, response, from, their, sample, group, and, outline, the, usefulness, of, such, a, structure, in, website, design, usability, experts, including, jakob, nielsen, and, kyle, soucy, have, often, emphasised, homepage, design, for, website, success, and, asserted, that, the, homepage, is, the, most, important, page, on, a, website, nielsen, jakob, tahir, marie, october, 2001, homepage, usability, 50, websites, deconstructed, new, riders, publishing, isbn, 978, 0, 7357, 1102, 0, however, practitioners, into, the, 2000s, were, starting, to, find, that, a, growing, number, of, website, traffic, was, bypassing, the, homepage, going, directly, to, internal, content, pages, through, search, engines, e, newsletters, and, rss, feeds, leading, many, practitioners, to, argue, that,
