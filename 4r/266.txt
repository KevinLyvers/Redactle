the, golden, bough, a, study, in, comparative, religion, retitled, the, golden, bough, a, study, in, magic, and, religion, in, its, second, edition, is, a, wide, ranging, comparative, study, of, mythology, and, religion, written, by, the, scottish, anthropologist, sir, james, george, frazer, the, golden, bough, was, first, published, in, two, volumes, in, 1890, in, three, volumes, in, 1900, and, in, twelve, volumes, in, the, third, edition, published, 1906, 1915, it, has, also, been, published, in, several, different, one, volume, abridgments, the, work, was, for, a, wide, literate, audience, raised, on, tales, as, told, in, such, publications, as, thomas, bulfinch, s, the, age, of, fable, or, stories, of, gods, and, heroes, 1855, the, influence, of, the, golden, bough, on, contemporary, european, literature, and, thought, has, been, substantial, frazer, attempted, to, define, the, shared, elements, of, religious, belief, and, scientific, thought, discussing, fertility, rites, human, sacrifice, the, dying, god, the, scapegoat, and, many, other, symbols, and, practices, whose, influences, had, extended, into, 20th, century, culture, his, thesis, is, that, the, most, ancient, religions, were, fertility, cults, that, revolved, around, the, worship, and, periodic, sacrifice, of, a, sacred, king, in, accordance, with, the, cycle, of, the, seasons, frazer, proposed, that, mankind, s, understanding, of, the, natural, world, progresses, from, magic, through, religious, belief, to, scientific, thought, frazer, s, thesis, was, developed, in, relation, to, an, incident, in, virgil, s, aeneid, in, which, aeneas, and, the, sibyl, present, the, golden, bough, taken, from, a, sacred, grove, to, the, gatekeeper, of, hades, to, gain, admission, the, incident, was, illustrated, by, j, m, w, turner, s, 1834, painting, the, golden, bough, frazer, mistakenly, states, that, the, painting, depicts, the, lake, at, nemi, though, it, is, actually, lake, avernus, the, lake, of, nemi, also, known, as, diana, s, mirror, was, a, place, where, religious, ceremonies, and, the, fulfillment, of, vows, of, priests, and, kings, were, held, frazer, based, his, thesis, on, the, pre, roman, priest, king, rex, nemorensis, a, priest, of, diana, at, lake, nemi, who, was, ritually, murdered, by, his, successor, the, king, was, the, incarnation, of, a, dying, and, reviving, god, a, solar, deity, who, underwent, a, mystic, marriage, to, a, goddess, of, the, earth, died, at, the, harvest, and, was, reincarnated, in, the, spring, frazer, claims, that, this, legend, of, rebirth, was, central, to, almost, all, of, the, world, s, mythologies, frazer, wrote, in, a, preface, to, the, third, edition, of, the, golden, bough, that, while, he, had, never, studied, georg, wilhelm, friedrich, hegel, his, friend, james, ward, and, the, philosopher, j, m, e, mctaggart, had, both, suggested, to, him, that, hegel, had, anticipated, his, view, of, the, nature, and, historical, relations, of, magic, and, religion, frazer, saw, the, resemblance, as, being, that, we, both, hold, that, in, the, mental, evolution, of, humanity, an, age, of, magic, preceded, an, age, of, religion, and, that, the, characteristic, difference, between, magic, and, religion, is, that, whereas, magic, aims, at, controlling, nature, directly, religion, aims, at, controlling, it, indirectly, through, the, mediation, of, a, powerful, supernatural, being, or, beings, to, whom, man, appeals, for, help, and, protection, frazer, included, an, extract, from, hegel, s, lectures, on, the, philosophy, of, religion, 1832, the, golden, bough, scandalized, the, british, public, when, first, published, as, it, included, the, christian, story, of, the, resurrection, of, jesus, in, its, comparative, study, critics, thought, this, treatment, invited, an, agnostic, reading, of, the, lamb, of, god, as, a, relic, of, a, pagan, religion, for, the, third, edition, frazer, placed, his, analysis, of, the, crucifixion, in, a, speculative, appendix, while, discussion, of, christianity, was, excluded, from, the, single, volume, abridged, edition, frazer, himself, accepted, that, his, theories, were, speculative, and, that, the, associations, he, made, were, circumstantial, and, usually, based, only, on, resemblance, he, wrote, books, like, mine, merely, speculation, will, be, superseded, sooner, or, later, the, sooner, the, better, for, the, sake, of, truth, by, better, induction, based, on, fuller, knowledge, in, 1922, at, the, inauguration, of, the, frazer, lectureship, in, anthropology, he, said, it, is, my, earnest, wish, that, the, lectureship, should, be, used, solely, for, the, disinterested, pursuit, of, truth, and, not, for, the, dissemination, and, propagation, of, any, theories, or, opinions, of, mine, godfrey, lienhardt, notes, that, even, during, frazer, s, lifetime, social, anthropologists, had, for, the, most, part, distanced, themselves, from, his, theories, and, opinions, and, that, the, lasting, influence, of, the, golden, bough, and, frazer, s, wider, body, of, work, has, been, in, the, literary, rather, than, the, academic, world, robert, ackerman, writes, that, for, british, social, anthropologists, frazer, is, still, an, embarrassment, for, being, the, most, famous, of, them, all, even, as, the, field, now, rejects, most, of, his, ideas, while, the, golden, bough, achieved, wide, popular, appeal, and, exerted, a, disproportionate, influence, on, so, many, creative, writers, frazer, s, ideas, played, a, much, smaller, part, in, the, history, of, academic, social, anthropology, lienhardt, himself, dismissed, frazer, s, interpretations, of, primitive, religion, as, little, more, than, plausible, constructs, of, own, victorian, rationalism, while, ludwig, wittgenstein, in, his, remarks, on, frazer, s, golden, bough, published, in, 1967, wrote, frazer, is, much, more, savage, than, most, of, his, savages, his, explanations, of, observances, are, much, cruder, than, the, sense, of, the, observances, themselves, r, g, collingwood, shared, wittgenstein, s, criticism, initially, the, book, s, influence, on, the, emerging, discipline, of, anthropology, was, pervasive, polish, anthropologist, bronis, aw, malinowski, said, of, the, golden, bough, no, sooner, had, i, read, this, great, work, than, i, became, immersed, in, it, and, enslaved, by, it, i, realized, then, that, anthropology, as, presented, by, sir, james, frazer, is, a, great, science, worthy, of, as, much, devotion, as, any, of, her, elder, and, more, exact, studies, and, i, became, bound, to, the, service, of, frazerian, anthropology, however, by, the, 1920s, frazer, s, ideas, already, began, to, belong, to, the, past, according, to, godfrey, lienhardt, the, central, theme, or, as, he, thought, theory, of, the, golden, bough, that, all, mankind, had, evolved, intellectually, and, psychologically, from, a, superstitious, belief, in, magicians, through, a, superstitious, belief, in, priests, and, gods, to, enlightened, belief, in, scientists, had, little, or, no, relevance, to, the, conduct, of, life, in, an, andamanese, camp, or, a, melanesian, village, and, the, whole, supposedly, scientific, basis, of, frazer, s, anthropology, was, seen, as, a, misapplication, of, darwin, s, theory, of, biological, evolution, to, human, history, and, psychology, edmund, leach, one, of, the, most, impatient, critics, of, frazer, s, overblown, prose, and, literary, embellishment, of, his, sources, for, dramatic, effect, scathingly, criticized, what, he, saw, as, the, artistic, license, exercised, by, frazer, in, the, golden, bough, frazer, used, his, ethnographic, evidence, which, he, culled, from, here, there, and, everywhere, to, illustrate, propositions, which, he, had, arrived, at, in, advance, by, a, priori, reasoning, but, to, a, degree, which, is, often, quite, startling, whenever, the, evidence, did, not, fit, he, simply, altered, the, evidence, ren, girard, a, french, historian, literary, critic, and, philosopher, of, social, science, grudgingly, praised, frazer, for, recognising, kingly, sacrifice, as, a, key, primitive, ritual, but, described, his, interpretation, of, the, ritual, as, a, grave, injustice, to, ethnology, girard, s, criticisms, against, the, golden, bough, were, numerous, particularly, concerning, frazer, s, assertion, that, christianity, was, merely, a, perpetuation, of, primitive, myth, ritualism, and, that, the, new, testament, gospels, were, just, further, myths, of, the, death, and, resurrection, of, the, king, who, embodies, the, god, of, vegetation, girard, himself, considered, the, gospels, to, be, revelatory, texts, rather, than, myths, or, the, remains, of, ignorant, superstition, and, rejected, frazer, s, idea, that, the, death, of, jesus, was, a, sacrifice, whatever, definition, we, may, give, for, that, sacrifice, despite, the, controversy, generated, by, the, work, and, its, critical, reception, amongst, other, scholars, the, golden, bough, inspired, much, of, the, creative, literature, of, the, period, the, poet, robert, graves, adapted, frazer, s, concept, of, the, dying, king, sacrificed, for, the, good, of, the, kingdom, to, the, romantic, idea, of, the, poet, s, suffering, for, the, sake, of, his, muse, goddess, as, reflected, in, his, book, on, poetry, rituals, and, myths, the, white, goddess, 1948, william, butler, yeats, refers, to, frazer, s, thesis, in, his, poem, sailing, to, byzantium, the, horror, writer, h, p, lovecraft, s, understanding, of, religion, was, influenced, by, the, golden, bough, and, lovecraft, mentions, the, book, in, his, short, story, the, call, of, cthulhu, t, s, eliot, acknowledged, indebtedness, to, frazer, in, his, first, note, to, his, poem, the, waste, land, william, carlos, williams, refers, to, the, golden, bough, in, book, two, part, two, of, paterson, frazer, also, influenced, novelists, james, joyce, ernest, hemingway, william, gaddis, and, d, h, lawrence, the, lyrics, of, the, song, not, to, touch, the, earth, by, the, doors, were, influenced, by, the, golden, bough, with, the, title, and, opening, lines, being, taken, from, its, table, of, contents, francis, ford, coppola, s, film, apocalypse, now, shows, the, antagonist, kurtz, with, the, book, in, his, lair, and, his, death, is, depicted, as, a, ritual, sacrifice, the, mythologist, joseph, campbell, drew, on, the, golden, bough, in, the, hero, with, a, thousand, faces, 1949, in, which, he, accepted, frazer, s, view, that, mythology, is, a, primitive, attempt, to, explain, the, world, of, nature, though, considering, it, only, one, among, a, number, of, valid, explanations, of, mythology, campbell, later, described, frazer, s, work, as, monumental, the, anthropologist, weston, la, barre, described, frazer, as, the, last, of, the, scholastics, in, the, human, animal, 1955, the, philosopher, ludwig, wittgenstein, s, commentaries, on, the, golden, bough, have, been, compiled, as, remarks, on, frazer, s, golden, bough, edited, by, rush, rhees, originally, published, in, 1967, the, english, edition, followed, in, 1979, robert, ackerman, in, his, the, myth, and, ritual, school, j, g, frazer, and, the, cambridge, ritualists, 1991, sets, frazer, in, the, broader, context, of, the, history, of, ideas, the, myth, and, ritual, school, includes, scholars, jane, harrison, gilbert, murray, f, m, cornford, and, a, b, cook, who, were, connecting, the, new, discipline, of, myth, theory, and, anthropology, with, traditional, literary, classics, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, influencing, modernist, literature, the, golden, bough, influenced, sigmund, freud, s, work, totem, and, taboo, 1913, as, well, as, the, work, of, freud, s, student, carl, jung, the, critic, camille, paglia, has, identified, the, golden, bough, as, one, of, the, most, important, influences, on, her, book, sexual, personae, 1990, in, sexual, personae, paglia, described, frazer, s, most, brilliant, perception, in, the, golden, bough, as, his, analogy, between, jesus, and, the, dying, gods, though, she, noted, that, it, was, muted, by, prudence, in, salon, she, has, described, the, work, as, a, model, of, intriguing, specificity, wed, to, speculative, imagination, paglia, acknowledged, that, many, details, in, frazer, have, been, contradicted, or, superseded, but, maintained, that, the, work, of, frazer, s, cambridge, school, of, classical, anthropology, will, remain, inspirational, for, enterprising, students, seeking, escape, from, today, s, sterile, academic, climate, paglia, has, also, commented, however, that, the, one, volume, abridgement, of, the, golden, bough, is, bland, and, should, be, avoided, like, the, plague
