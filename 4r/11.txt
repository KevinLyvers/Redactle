ancient, roman, architecture, adopted, the, external, language, of, classical, ancient, greek, architecture, for, the, purposes, of, the, ancient, romans, but, was, different, from, greek, buildings, becoming, a, new, architectural, style, the, two, styles, are, often, considered, one, body, of, classical, architecture, roman, architecture, flourished, in, the, roman, republic, and, to, an, even, greater, extent, under, the, empire, when, the, great, majority, of, surviving, buildings, were, constructed, it, used, new, materials, particularly, roman, concrete, and, newer, technologies, such, as, the, arch, and, the, dome, to, make, buildings, that, were, typically, strong, and, well, engineered, large, numbers, remain, in, some, form, across, the, former, empire, sometimes, complete, and, still, in, use, today, roman, architecture, covers, the, period, from, the, establishment, of, the, roman, republic, in, 509, bc, to, about, the, 4th, century, ad, after, which, it, becomes, reclassified, as, late, antique, or, byzantine, architecture, few, substantial, examples, survive, from, before, about, 100, bc, and, most, of, the, major, survivals, are, from, the, later, empire, after, about, 100, ad, roman, architectural, style, continued, to, influence, building, in, the, former, empire, for, many, centuries, and, the, style, used, in, western, europe, beginning, about, 1000, is, called, romanesque, architecture, to, reflect, this, dependence, on, basic, roman, forms, the, romans, only, began, to, achieve, significant, originality, in, architecture, around, the, beginning, of, the, imperial, period, after, they, had, combined, aspects, of, their, originally, etruscan, architecture, with, others, taken, from, greece, including, most, elements, of, the, style, we, now, call, classical, architecture, they, moved, from, trabeated, construction, mostly, based, on, columns, and, lintels, to, one, based, on, massive, walls, punctuated, by, arches, and, later, domes, both, of, which, greatly, developed, under, the, romans, the, classical, orders, now, became, largely, decorative, rather, than, structural, except, in, colonnades, stylistic, developments, included, the, tuscan, and, composite, orders, the, first, being, a, shortened, simplified, variant, on, the, doric, order, and, the, composite, being, a, tall, order, with, the, floral, decoration, of, the, corinthian, and, the, scrolls, of, the, ionic, the, period, from, roughly, 40, bc, to, about, 230, ad, saw, most, of, the, greatest, achievements, before, the, crisis, of, the, third, century, and, later, troubles, reduced, the, wealth, and, organizing, power, of, the, central, governments, the, romans, produced, massive, public, buildings, and, works, of, civil, engineering, and, were, responsible, for, significant, developments, in, housing, and, public, hygiene, for, example, their, public, and, private, baths, and, latrines, under, floor, heating, in, the, form, of, the, hypocaust, mica, glazing, examples, in, ostia, antica, and, piped, hot, and, cold, water, examples, in, pompeii, and, ostia, despite, the, technical, developments, of, the, romans, which, took, their, buildings, far, away, from, the, basic, greek, conception, where, columns, were, needed, to, support, heavy, beams, and, roofs, they, were, reluctant, to, abandon, the, classical, orders, in, formal, public, buildings, even, though, these, had, become, essentially, decorative, however, they, did, not, feel, entirely, restricted, by, greek, aesthetic, concerns, and, treated, the, orders, with, considerable, freedom, innovation, started, in, the, 3rd, or, 2nd, century, bc, with, the, development, of, roman, concrete, as, a, readily, available, adjunct, to, or, substitute, for, stone, and, brick, more, daring, buildings, soon, followed, with, great, pillars, supporting, broad, arches, and, domes, the, freedom, of, concrete, also, inspired, the, colonnade, screen, a, row, of, purely, decorative, columns, in, front, of, a, load, bearing, wall, in, smaller, scale, architecture, concrete, s, strength, freed, the, floor, plan, from, rectangular, cells, to, a, more, free, flowing, environment, factors, such, as, wealth, and, high, population, densities, in, cities, forced, the, ancient, romans, to, discover, new, architectural, solutions, of, their, own, the, use, of, vaults, and, arches, together, with, a, sound, knowledge, of, building, materials, enabled, them, to, achieve, unprecedented, successes, in, the, construction, of, imposing, infrastructure, for, public, use, examples, include, the, aqueducts, of, rome, the, baths, of, diocletian, and, the, baths, of, caracalla, the, basilicas, and, colosseum, these, were, reproduced, at, a, smaller, scale, in, the, most, important, towns, and, cities, in, the, empire, some, surviving, structures, are, almost, complete, such, as, the, town, walls, of, lugo, in, hispania, tarraconensis, now, northern, spain, the, administrative, structure, and, wealth, of, the, empire, made, possible, very, large, projects, even, in, locations, remote, from, the, main, centers, as, did, the, use, of, slave, labor, both, skilled, and, unskilled, especially, under, the, empire, architecture, often, served, a, political, function, demonstrating, the, power, of, the, roman, state, in, general, and, of, specific, individuals, responsible, for, building, roman, architecture, perhaps, reached, its, peak, in, the, reign, of, hadrian, whose, many, achievements, include, rebuilding, the, pantheon, in, its, current, form, and, leaving, his, mark, on, the, landscape, of, northern, britain, with, hadrian, s, wall, while, borrowing, much, from, the, preceding, etruscan, architecture, such, as, the, use, of, hydraulics, and, the, construction, of, arches, roman, prestige, architecture, remained, firmly, under, the, spell, of, ancient, greek, architecture, and, the, classical, orders, this, came, initially, from, magna, graecia, the, greek, colonies, in, southern, italy, and, indirectly, from, greek, influence, on, the, etruscans, but, after, the, roman, conquest, of, greece, directly, from, the, best, classical, and, hellenistic, examples, in, the, greek, world, the, influence, is, evident, in, many, ways, for, example, in, the, introduction, and, use, of, the, triclinium, in, roman, villas, as, a, place, and, manner, of, dining, roman, builders, employed, greeks, in, many, capacities, especially, in, the, great, boom, in, construction, in, the, early, empire, the, roman, architectural, revolution, also, known, as, the, concrete, revolution, was, the, widespread, use, in, roman, architecture, of, the, previously, little, used, architectural, forms, of, the, arch, vault, and, dome, for, the, first, time, in, history, their, potential, was, fully, exploited, in, the, construction, of, a, wide, range, of, civil, engineering, structures, public, buildings, and, military, facilities, these, included, amphitheatres, aqueducts, baths, bridges, circuses, dams, domes, harbours, temples, and, theatres, according, to, gottfried, semper, roman, architecture, was, the, idea, of, world, domination, expressed, in, stone, a, crucial, factor, in, this, development, which, saw, a, trend, toward, monumental, architecture, was, the, invention, of, roman, concrete, opus, caementicium, which, led, to, the, liberation, of, shapes, from, the, dictates, of, the, traditional, materials, of, stone, and, brick, these, enabled, the, building, of, the, many, aqueducts, throughout, the, roman, empire, such, as, the, aqueduct, of, segovia, the, pont, du, gard, and, the, eleven, aqueducts, of, rome, the, same, concepts, produced, numerous, bridges, some, of, which, are, still, in, daily, use, for, example, the, puente, romano, at, m, rida, in, spain, and, the, pont, julien, and, the, bridge, at, vaison, la, romaine, both, in, provence, france, the, dome, permitted, the, construction, of, vaulted, ceilings, without, crossbeams, and, made, possible, large, covered, public, spaces, such, as, public, baths, and, basilicas, such, as, hadrian, s, pantheon, the, baths, of, diocletian, and, the, baths, of, caracalla, all, in, rome, the, romans, first, adopted, the, arch, from, the, etruscans, and, implemented, it, in, their, own, building, the, use, of, arches, that, spring, directly, from, the, tops, of, columns, was, a, roman, development, seen, from, the, 1st, century, ad, that, was, very, widely, adopted, in, medieval, western, byzantine, and, islamic, architecture, the, romans, were, the, first, builders, in, the, history, of, architecture, to, realize, the, potential, of, domes, for, the, creation, of, large, and, well, defined, interior, spaces, domes, were, introduced, in, a, number, of, roman, building, types, such, as, temples, thermae, palaces, mausolea, and, later, also, churches, half, domes, also, became, a, favored, architectural, element, and, were, adopted, as, apses, in, christian, sacred, architecture, monumental, domes, began, to, appear, in, the, 1st, century, bc, in, rome, and, the, provinces, around, the, mediterranean, sea, along, with, vaults, they, gradually, replaced, the, traditional, post, and, lintel, construction, which, makes, use, of, the, column, and, architrave, the, construction, of, domes, was, greatly, facilitated, by, the, invention, of, concrete, a, process, which, has, been, termed, the, roman, architectural, revolution, their, enormous, dimensions, remained, unsurpassed, until, the, introduction, of, structural, steel, frames, in, the, late, 19th, century, see, list, of, the, world, s, largest, domes, roman, architecture, supplied, the, basic, vocabulary, of, pre, romanesque, and, romanesque, architecture, and, spread, across, christian, europe, well, beyond, the, old, frontiers, of, the, empire, to, ireland, and, scandinavia, for, example, in, the, east, byzantine, architecture, developed, new, styles, of, churches, but, most, other, buildings, remained, very, close, to, late, roman, forms, the, same, can, be, said, in, turn, of, islamic, architecture, where, roman, forms, long, continued, especially, in, private, buildings, such, as, houses, and, the, bathhouse, and, civil, engineering, such, as, fortifications, and, bridges, in, europe, the, italian, renaissance, saw, a, conscious, revival, of, correct, classical, styles, initially, purely, based, on, roman, examples, vitruvius, was, respectfully, reinterpreted, by, a, series, of, architectural, writers, and, the, tuscan, and, composite, orders, formalized, for, the, first, time, to, give, five, rather, than, three, orders, after, the, flamboyance, of, baroque, architecture, the, neoclassical, architecture, of, the, 18th, century, revived, purer, versions, of, classical, style, and, for, the, first, time, added, direct, influence, from, the, greek, world, numerous, local, classical, styles, developed, such, as, palladian, architecture, georgian, architecture, and, regency, architecture, in, the, english, speaking, world, federal, architecture, in, the, united, states, and, later, stripped, classicism, and, pwa, moderne, roman, influences, may, be, found, around, us, today, in, banks, government, buildings, great, houses, and, even, small, houses, perhaps, in, the, form, of, a, porch, with, doric, columns, and, a, pediment, or, in, a, fireplace, or, a, mosaic, shower, floor, derived, from, a, roman, original, often, from, pompeii, or, herculaneum, the, mighty, pillars, domes, and, arches, of, rome, echo, in, the, new, world, too, where, in, washington, d, c, stand, the, capitol, building, the, white, house, the, lincoln, memorial, and, other, government, buildings, all, across, the, us, the, seats, of, regional, government, were, normally, built, in, the, grand, traditions, of, rome, with, vast, flights, of, stone, steps, sweeping, up, to, towering, pillared, porticoes, with, huge, domes, gilded, or, decorated, inside, with, the, same, or, similar, themes, that, were, popular, in, rome, in, britain, a, similar, enthusiasm, has, seen, the, construction, of, thousands, of, neoclassical, buildings, over, the, last, five, centuries, both, civic, and, domestic, and, many, of, the, grandest, country, houses, and, mansions, are, purely, classical, in, style, an, obvious, example, being, buckingham, palace, marble, is, not, found, especially, close, to, rome, and, was, only, rarely, used, there, before, augustus, who, famously, boasted, that, he, had, found, rome, made, of, brick, and, left, it, made, of, marble, though, this, was, mainly, as, a, facing, for, brick, or, concrete, the, temple, of, hercules, victor, of, the, late, 2nd, century, bc, is, the, earliest, surviving, exception, in, rome, from, augustus, reign, the, quarries, at, carrara, were, extensively, developed, for, the, capital, and, other, sources, around, the, empire, exploited, especially, the, prestigious, greek, marbles, like, parian, travertine, limestone, was, found, much, closer, around, tivoli, and, was, used, from, the, end, of, the, republic, the, colosseum, is, mainly, built, of, this, stone, which, has, good, load, bearing, capacity, with, a, brick, core, other, more, or, less, local, stones, were, used, around, the, empire, the, romans, were, fond, of, luxury, imported, coloured, marbles, with, fancy, veining, and, the, interiors, of, the, most, important, buildings, were, often, faced, with, slabs, of, these, which, have, usually, now, been, removed, even, where, the, building, survives, imports, from, greece, for, this, purpose, began, in, the, 2nd, century, bc, the, romans, made, fired, clay, bricks, from, about, the, beginning, of, the, empire, replacing, earlier, sun, dried, mudbrick, roman, brick, was, almost, invariably, of, a, lesser, height, than, modern, brick, but, was, made, in, a, variety, of, different, shapes, and, sizes, shapes, included, square, rectangular, triangular, and, round, and, the, largest, bricks, found, have, measured, over, three, feet, in, length, ancient, roman, bricks, had, a, general, size, of, 1, roman, feet, by, 1, roman, foot, but, common, variations, up, to, 15, inches, existed, other, brick, sizes, in, ancient, rome, included, 24, x, 12, x, 4, and, 15, x, 8, x, 10, ancient, roman, bricks, found, in, france, measured, 8, x, 8, x, 3, the, constantine, basilica, in, trier, is, constructed, from, roman, bricks, 15, square, by, 1, thick, there, is, often, little, obvious, difference, particularly, when, only, fragments, survive, between, roman, bricks, used, for, walls, on, the, one, hand, and, tiles, used, for, roofing, or, flooring, on, the, other, so, archaeologists, sometimes, prefer, to, employ, the, generic, term, ceramic, building, material, or, cbm, the, romans, perfected, brick, making, during, the, first, century, of, their, empire, and, used, it, ubiquitously, in, public, and, private, construction, alike, they, took, their, brickmaking, skills, everywhere, they, went, introducing, the, craft, to, the, local, populations, the, roman, legions, which, operated, their, own, kilns, introduced, bricks, to, many, parts, of, the, empire, bricks, are, often, stamped, with, the, mark, of, the, legion, that, supervised, their, production, the, use, of, bricks, in, southern, and, western, germany, for, example, can, be, traced, to, traditions, already, described, by, the, roman, architect, vitruvius, in, the, british, isles, the, introduction, of, roman, brick, by, the, ancient, romans, was, followed, by, a, 600, 700, year, gap, in, major, brick, production, concrete, quickly, supplanted, brick, as, the, primary, building, material, and, more, daring, buildings, soon, followed, with, great, pillars, supporting, broad, arches, and, domes, rather, than, dense, lines, of, columns, suspending, flat, architraves, the, freedom, of, concrete, also, inspired, the, colonnade, screen, a, row, of, purely, decorative, columns, in, front, of, a, load, bearing, wall, in, smaller, scale, architecture, concrete, s, strength, freed, the, floor, plan, from, rectangular, cells, to, a, more, free, flowing, environment, most, of, these, developments, are, described, by, vitruvius, writing, in, the, first, century, bc, in, his, work, de, architectura, although, concrete, had, been, used, on, a, minor, scale, in, mesopotamia, roman, architects, perfected, roman, concrete, and, used, it, in, buildings, where, it, could, stand, on, its, own, and, support, a, great, deal, of, weight, the, first, use, of, concrete, by, the, romans, was, in, the, town, of, cosa, sometime, after, 273, bc, ancient, roman, concrete, was, a, mixture, of, lime, mortar, aggregate, pozzolana, water, and, stones, and, was, stronger, than, previously, used, concretes, the, ancient, builders, placed, these, ingredients, in, wooden, frames, where, they, hardened, and, bonded, to, a, facing, of, stones, or, more, frequently, bricks, the, aggregates, used, were, often, much, larger, than, in, modern, concrete, amounting, to, rubble, when, the, framework, was, removed, the, new, wall, was, very, strong, with, a, rough, surface, of, bricks, or, stones, this, surface, could, be, smoothed, and, faced, with, an, attractive, stucco, or, thin, panels, of, marble, or, other, coloured, stones, called, a, revetment, concrete, construction, proved, to, be, more, flexible, and, less, costly, than, building, solid, stone, buildings, the, materials, were, readily, available, and, not, difficult, to, transport, the, wooden, frames, could, be, used, more, than, once, allowing, builders, to, work, quickly, and, efficiently, concrete, is, arguably, the, roman, contribution, most, relevant, to, modern, architecture, the, amphitheatre, was, with, the, triumphal, arch, and, basilica, the, only, major, new, type, of, building, developed, by, the, romans, some, of, the, most, impressive, secular, buildings, are, the, amphitheatres, over, 200, being, known, and, many, of, which, are, well, preserved, such, as, that, at, arles, as, well, as, its, progenitor, the, colosseum, in, rome, they, were, used, for, gladiatorial, contests, public, displays, public, meetings, and, bullfights, the, tradition, of, which, still, survives, in, spain, and, portugal, their, typical, shape, functions, and, name, distinguish, them, from, roman, theatres, which, are, more, or, less, semicircular, in, shape, from, the, circuses, akin, to, hippodromes, whose, much, longer, circuits, were, designed, mainly, for, horse, or, chariot, racing, events, and, from, the, smaller, stadia, which, were, primarily, designed, for, athletics, and, footraces, the, earliest, roman, amphitheatres, date, from, the, middle, of, the, first, century, bc, but, most, were, built, under, imperial, rule, from, the, augustan, period, 27, bc, 14, ad, onwards, imperial, amphitheatres, were, built, throughout, the, roman, empire, the, largest, could, accommodate, 40, 000, 60, 000, spectators, and, the, most, elaborate, featured, multi, storeyed, arcaded, fa, ades, and, were, elaborately, decorated, with, marble, stucco, and, statuary, after, the, end, of, gladiatorial, games, in, the, 5th, century, and, of, animal, killings, in, the, 6th, most, amphitheatres, fell, into, disrepair, and, their, materials, were, mined, or, recycled, some, were, razed, and, others, converted, into, fortifications, a, few, continued, as, convenient, open, meeting, places, in, some, of, these, churches, were, sited, architecturally, they, are, typically, an, example, of, the, roman, use, of, the, classical, orders, to, decorate, large, concrete, walls, pierced, at, intervals, where, the, columns, have, nothing, to, support, aesthetically, however, the, formula, is, successful, the, roman, basilica, was, a, large, public, building, where, business, or, legal, matters, could, be, transacted, they, were, normally, where, the, magistrates, held, court, and, used, for, other, official, ceremonies, having, many, of, the, functions, of, the, modern, town, hall, the, first, basilicas, had, no, religious, function, as, early, as, the, time, of, augustus, a, public, basilica, for, transacting, business, had, been, part, of, any, settlement, that, considered, itself, a, city, used, in, the, same, way, as, the, late, medieval, covered, market, houses, of, northern, europe, where, the, meeting, room, for, lack, of, urban, space, was, set, above, the, arcades, although, their, form, was, variable, basilicas, often, contained, interior, colonnades, that, divided, the, space, giving, aisles, or, arcaded, spaces, on, one, or, both, sides, with, an, apse, at, one, end, or, less, often, at, each, end, where, the, magistrates, sat, often, on, a, slightly, raised, dais, the, central, aisle, tended, to, be, wide, and, was, higher, than, the, flanking, aisles, so, that, light, could, penetrate, through, the, clerestory, windows, the, oldest, known, basilica, the, basilica, porcia, was, built, in, rome, in, 184, bc, by, cato, the, elder, during, the, time, he, was, censor, other, early, examples, include, the, basilica, at, pompeii, late, 2nd, century, bc, after, christianity, became, the, official, religion, the, basilica, shape, was, found, appropriate, for, the, first, large, public, churches, with, the, attraction, of, avoiding, reminiscences, of, the, greco, roman, temple, form, the, roman, circus, was, a, large, open, air, venue, used, for, public, events, in, the, ancient, roman, empire, the, circuses, were, similar, to, the, ancient, greek, hippodromes, although, circuses, served, varying, purposes, and, differed, in, design, and, construction, along, with, theatres, and, amphitheatres, circuses, were, one, of, the, main, entertainment, sites, of, the, time, circuses, were, venues, for, chariot, racing, horse, races, and, performances, that, commemorated, important, events, of, the, empire, were, performed, there, for, events, that, involved, re, enactments, of, naval, battles, the, circus, was, flooded, with, water, the, performance, space, of, the, roman, circus, was, normally, despite, its, name, an, oblong, rectangle, of, two, linear, sections, of, race, track, separated, by, a, median, strip, running, along, the, length, of, about, two, thirds, the, track, joined, at, one, end, with, a, semicircular, section, and, at, the, other, end, with, an, undivided, section, of, track, closed, in, most, cases, by, a, distinctive, starting, gate, known, as, the, carceres, thereby, creating, a, circuit, for, the, races, during, the, years, of, the, republic, augustus, claimed, he, found, the, city, in, brick, and, left, it, in, marble, while, chances, are, high, that, this, was, an, exaggeration, there, is, something, to, be, said, for, the, influx, of, marble, use, in, roman, forum, from, 63, bc, onwards, during, augustus, reign, the, forum, was, described, to, have, been, a, larger, freer, space, than, was, the, forum, of, imperial, times, the, forum, began, to, take, on, even, more, changes, upon, the, arrival, of, julius, caesar, who, drew, out, extensive, plans, for, the, market, hub, while, caesar, s, death, came, prematurely, his, ideas, as, well, as, augustus, in, regards, to, the, forum, proved, to, be, the, most, influential, for, years, to, come, according, to, walter, dennison, s, the, roman, forum, as, cicero, saw, it, the, author, writes, that, the, diverting, of, public, business, to, the, larger, and, splendid, imperial, fora, erected, in, the, vicinity, resulted, in, leaving, the, general, design, of, the, forum, romanum, every, city, had, at, least, one, forum, of, varying, size, in, addition, to, its, standard, function, as, a, marketplace, a, forum, was, a, gathering, place, of, great, social, significance, and, often, the, scene, of, diverse, activities, including, political, discussions, and, debates, rendezvous, meetings, etc, the, best, known, example, is, the, roman, forum, the, earliest, of, several, in, rome, in, new, roman, towns, the, forum, was, usually, located, at, or, just, off, the, intersection, of, the, main, north, south, and, east, west, streets, the, cardo, and, decumanus, all, forums, would, have, a, temple, of, jupiter, at, the, north, end, and, would, also, contain, other, temples, as, well, as, the, basilica, a, public, weights, and, measures, table, so, customers, at, the, market, could, ensure, they, were, not, being, sold, short, measures, and, would, often, have, the, baths, nearby, a, horreum, was, a, type, of, public, warehouse, used, during, the, ancient, roman, period, although, the, latin, term, is, often, used, to, refer, to, granaries, roman, horrea, were, used, to, store, many, other, types, of, consumables, the, giant, horrea, galbae, in, rome, were, used, not, only, to, store, grain, but, also, olive, oil, wine, foodstuffs, clothing, and, even, marble, by, the, end, of, the, imperial, period, the, city, of, rome, had, nearly, 300, horrea, to, supply, its, demands, the, biggest, were, enormous, even, by, modern, standards, the, horrea, galbae, contained, 140, rooms, on, the, ground, floor, alone, covering, an, area, of, some, 225, 000, square, feet, 20, 900, square, metres, the, first, horrea, were, built, in, rome, towards, the, end, of, the, 2nd, century, bc, with, the, first, known, public, horreum, being, constructed, by, the, ill, fated, tribune, gaius, gracchus, in, 123, bc, the, word, came, to, be, applied, to, any, place, designated, for, the, preservation, of, goods, thus, it, was, often, used, to, refer, to, cellars, horrea, subterranea, but, it, could, also, be, applied, to, a, place, where, artworks, were, stored, or, even, to, a, library, some, public, horrea, functioned, somewhat, like, banks, where, valuables, could, be, stored, but, the, most, important, class, of, horrea, were, those, where, foodstuffs, such, as, grain, and, olive, oil, were, stored, and, distributed, by, the, state, the, word, itself, is, thought, to, have, linguist, roots, tied, to, the, word, hordeum, which, in, latin, means, barley, in, the, johns, hopkins, university, press, the, classical,

survive, in, any, sort, of, complete, state, their, construction, and, maintenance, was, a, major, part, of, ancient, roman, religion, and, all, towns, of, any, importance, had, at, least, one, main, temple, as, well, as, smaller, shrines, the, main, room, cella, housed, the, cult, image, of, the, deity, to, whom, the, temple, was, dedicated, and, often, a, small, altar, for, incense, or, libations, behind, the, cella, was, a, room, or, rooms, used, by, temple, attendants, for, storage, of, equipment, and, offerings, remains, of, many, roman, temples, survive, above, all, in, rome, itself, but, the, relatively, few, near, complete, examples, were, nearly, all, converted, to, christian, churches, usually, a, considerable, time, after, the, initial, triumph, of, christianity, under, constantine, the, decline, of, roman, religion, was, relatively, slow, and, the, temples, themselves, were, not, appropriated, by, the, government, until, a, decree, of, the, emperor, honorius, in, 415, some, of, the, oldest, surviving, temples, include, the, temple, of, hercules, victor, mid, 2nd, century, bc, and, temple, of, portunus, 120, 80, bc, both, standing, within, the, forum,

model, but, using, greek, styles, roman, temples, emphasised, the, front, of, the, building, which, followed, greek, temple, models, and, typically, consisted, of, wide, steps, leading, to, a, portico, with, columns, a, pronaos, and, usually, a, triangular, pediment, above, which, was, filled, with, statuary, in, the, most, grand, examples, this, was, as, often, in, terracotta, as, stone, and, no, examples, have, survived, except, as, fragments, however, unlike, the, greek, models, which, generally, gave, equal, treatment, to, all, sides, of, the, temple, which, could, be, viewed, and, approached, from, all, directions, the, sides, and, rear, of, roman, temples, might, be, largely, undecorated, as, in, the, pantheon, rome, and, temple, of, vic, inaccessible, by, steps, as, in, the, maison, carr, e, and, vic, and, even, back, on, to, other, buildings, as, in, the, maison, carr, e, columns, at, the, side, might, be, engaged, columns, emerging, from, engaged, with, in, architectural, terminology, the, wall, the, platform, on, which, the, temple, sat, was, typically, raised, higher, in, roman, examples, than, greek, with, up, ten, or, twelve, or, more, steps, rather, than, the, three, typical, in, greek, temples, the, temple, of, claudius, was, raised, twenty, steps, these, steps, were, normally, only, at, the, front, and, typically, not, the, whole, width, of, that, the, greek, classical, orders, in, all, their, details, were, closely, followed, in, the, fa, ades, of, temples, as, in, other, prestigious, buildings, however, the, idealized, proportions, between, the, different, elements, set, out, by, the, only, significant, roman, writer, on, architecture, to, survive, vitruvius, and, subsequent, italian, renaissance, writers, do, not, reflect, actual, roman, practice, which, could, be, very, variable, though, always, aiming, at, balance, and, harmony, following, a, hellenistic, trend, the, corinthian, order, and, its, variant, the, composite, order, were, most, common, in, surviving, roman, temples, but, for, small, temples, like, that, at, alc, ntara, a, simple, tuscan, order, could, be, used, there, was, considerable, local, variation, in, style, as, roman, architects, often, tried, to, incorporate, elements, the, population, expected, in, its, sacred, architecture, this, was, especially, the, case, in, egypt, and, the, near, east, where, different, traditions, of, large, stone, temples, were, already, millennia, old, the, romano, celtic, temple, was, a, simple, style, for, small, temples, found, in, the, western, empire, and, by, far, the, most, common, type, in, roman, britain, it, often, lacked, any, of, the, distinctive, classical, features, and, may, have, had, considerable, continuity, with, pre, roman, temples, of, the, celtic, religion, roman, theatres, were, built, in, all, areas, of, the, empire, from, spain, to, the, middle, east, because, of, the, romans, ability, to, influence, local, architecture, numerous, theatres, were, built, around, the, world, with, uniquely, roman, attributes, these, buildings, were, semi, circular, and, possessed, certain, inherent, architectural, structures, with, minor, differences, depending, on, the, region, in, which, they, were, constructed, the, scaenae, frons, was, a, high, back, wall, of, the, stage, floor, supported, by, columns, the, proscaenium, was, a, wall, that, supported, the, front, edge, of, the, stage, with, ornately, decorated, niches, to, the, sides, the, hellenistic, influence, is, seen, through, the, use, of, the, proscaenium, the, roman, theatre, also, had, a, podium, which, sometimes, supported, the, columns, of, the, scaenae, frons, the, scaenae, was, originally, not, part, of, the, building, itself, constructed, only, to, provide, sufficient, background, for, the, actors, eventually, it, became, a, part, of, the, edifice, itself, made, out, of, concrete, the, theatre, itself, was, divided, into, the, stage, orchestra, and, the, seating, section, auditorium, vomitoria, or, entrances, and, exits, were, made, available, to, the, audience, a, roman, villa, was, a, country, house, built, for, the, upper, class, while, a, domus, was, a, wealthy, family, s, house, in, a, town, the, empire, contained, many, kinds, of, villas, not, all, of, them, lavishly, appointed, with, mosaic, floors, and,

overlooking, the, bay, of, naples, some, villas, were, more, like, the, country, houses, of, england, the, visible, seat, of, power, of, a, local, magnate, such, as, the, famous, palace, rediscovered, at, fishbourne, in, sussex, suburban, villas, on, the, edge, of, cities, were, also, known, such, as, the, middle, and, late, republican, villas, that, encroached, on, the, campus, martius, at, that, time, on, the, edge, of, rome, and, which, can, be, also, seen, outside, the, city, walls, of, pompeii, including, the, villa, of, the, mysteries, known, for, its, frescos, these, early, suburban, villas, such, as, the, one, at, rome, s, auditorium, site, or, at, grottarossa, in, rome, demonstrate, the, antiquity, and, heritage, of, the, villa, suburbana, in, central, italy, it, is, possible, that, these, early, suburban, villas, were, also, in, fact, the, seats, of, power, maybe, even, palaces, of, regional, strongmen, or, heads, of, important, families, gentes, a, third, type, of, villa, provided, the, organizational, center, of, the, large, farming, estates, called, latifundia, such, villas, might, be, lacking, in, luxuries, by, the, 4th, century, villa, could, simply, mean, an,

different, types, of, watermills, were, introduced, these, include, all, three, variants, of, the, vertical, water, wheel, as, well, as, the, horizontal, water, wheel, apart, from, its, main, use, in, grinding, flour, water, power, was, also, applied, to, pounding, grain, crushing, ore, sawing, stones, and, possibly, fulling, and, bellows, for, iron, furnaces, in, architecture, a, monolith, is, a,

round, topped, arch, and, a, square, entablature, had, long, been, in, use, as, separate, architectural, elements, in, ancient, greece, the, innovation, of, the, romans, was, to, use, these, elements, in, a, single, free, standing, structure, the, columns, became, purely, decorative, elements, on, the, outer, face, of, the, arch, while, the, entablature, liberated, from, its, role, as, a, building,

generals, who, were, granted, a, triumph, were, termed, triumphators, and, would, erect, fornices, or, honorific, arches, bearing, statues, to, commemorate, their, victories, roman, triumphal, practices, changed, significantly, at, the, start, of, the, imperial, period, when, the, first, roman, emperor, augustus, decreed, that, only, emperors, would, be, granted, triumphs, the, triumphal, arch, changed, from, being, a, personal, monument, to, being, an, essentially, propagandistic, one, serving, to, announce, and, promote, the, presence, of, the, ruler, and, the, laws, of, the, state, arches, were, not, necessarily, built, as, entrances, but, unlike, many, modern, triumphal, arches, they, were, often, erected, across, roads, and, were, intended, to, be, passed, through, not, round, most, roman, triumphal, arches, were, built, during, the, imperial, period, by, the, fourth, century, ad, there, were, 36, such, arches, in, rome, of, which, three, have, survived, the, arch, of,

common, but, many, triple, arches, were, also, built, of, which, the, triumphal, arch, of, orange, c, ad, 21, is, the, earliest, surviving, example, from, the, 2nd, century, ad, many, examples, of, the, arcus, quadrifrons, a, square, triumphal, arch, erected, over, a, crossroads, with, arched, openings, on, all, four, sides, were, built, especially, in, north, africa, arch, building, in, rome,

were, segmental, such, as, alcon, tar, bridge, a, segmental, arch, is, an, arch, that, is, less, than, a, semicircle, the, advantages, of, the, segmental, arch, bridge, were, that, it, allowed, great, amounts, of, flood, water, to, pass, under, it, which, would, prevent, the, bridge, from, being, swept, away, during, floods, and, the, bridge, itself, could, be, more, lightweight, generally, roman,

called, opus, caementicium, the, outside, was, usually, covered, with, brick, or, ashlar, as, in, the, alc, ntara, bridge, the, romans, also, introduced, segmental, arch, bridges, into, bridge,

flat, profile, unsurpassed, for, more, than, a, millennium, trajan, s, bridge, over, the, danube, featured, open, spandrel, segmental, arches, made, of, wood, standing, on, 40, m, high, concrete, piers, this, was, to, be, the, longest, arch, bridge, for, a, thousand, years, both, in, terms, of, overall, and, individual, span, length, while, the, longest, extant, roman, bridge, is, the, 790, m, long, puente, romano, at, m, rida, roman, canals, were, typically, multi, purpose, structures, intended, for, irrigation, drainage, land, reclamation, flood, control, and, navigation, where, feasible, some, navigational, canals, were, recorded, by, ancient, geographers, and, are, still, traceable, by, modern, archaeology, channels, which, served, the, needs, of, urban, water, supply, are, covered, at, the, list, of, aqueducts, in, the, roman, empire, freshwater, reservoirs, were, commonly, set, up, at, the, termini, of, aqueducts, and, their, branch, lines, supplying, urban, households, agricultural, estates, imperial, palaces, thermae, or, naval, bases, of, the, roman, navy, roman, dam, construction, began, in, earnest, in, the, early, imperial, period, for, the, most, part, it, concentrated, on, the, semi, arid, fringe, of, the, empire, namely, the, provinces, of, north, africa, the, near, east, and, hispania, the, relative, abundance, of, spanish, dams, below, is, due, partly, to, more, intensive, field, work, there, for, italy, only, the, subiaco, dams, created, by, emperor, nero, 54, 68, ad, for, recreational, purposes, are, attested, these, dams, are, noteworthy, though, for, their, extraordinary, height, which, remained, unsurpassed, anywhere, in, the, world, until, the, late, middle, ages, the, most, frequent, dam, types, were, earth, or, rock, filled, embankment, dams, and, masonry, gravity, dams, these, served, a, wide, array, of, purposes, such, as, irrigation, flood, control, river, diversion, soil, retention, or, a, combination, of, these, functions, the, impermeability, of, roman, dams, was, increased, by, the, introduction, of, waterproof, hydraulic, mortar, and, especially, opus, caementicium, in, the, concrete, revolution, these, materials, also, allowed, for, bigger, structures, to, be, built, like, the, lake, homs, dam, possibly, the, largest, water, barrier, today, and, the, sturdy, harbaqa, dam, both, of, which, consist, of, a, concrete, core, roman, builders, were, the, first, to, realize, the, stabilizing, effect, of, arches, and, buttresses, which, they, integrated, into, their, dam, designs, previously, unknown, dam, types, introduced, by, the, romans, include, arch, gravity, dams, arch, dams, buttress, dams, and, multiple, arch, buttress, dams, the, romans, generally, fortified, cities, rather, than, fortresses, but, there, are, some, fortified, camps, such, as, the, saxon, shore, forts, like, porchester, castle, in, england, city, walls, were, already, significant, in, etruscan, architecture, and, in, the, struggle, for, control, of, italy, under, the, early, republic, many, more, were, built, using, different, techniques, these, included, tightly, fitting, massive, irregular, polygonal, blocks, shaped, to, fit, exactly, in, a, way, reminiscent, of, later, inca, work, the, romans, called, a, simple, rampart, wall, an, agger, at, this, date, great, height, was, not, necessary, the, servian, wall, around, rome, was, an, ambitious, project, of, the, early, 4th, century, bc, the, wall, was, up, to, 10, metres, 33, feet, in, height, in, places, 3, 6, metres, 12, feet, wide, at, its, base, 11, km, 6, 8, mi, long, and, is, believed, to, have, had, 16, main, gates, though, many, of, these, are, mentioned, only, from, writings, with, no, other, known, remains, some, of, it, had, a, fossa, or, ditch, in, front, and, an, agger, behind, and, it, was, enough, to, deter, hannibal, later, the, aurelian, wall, replaced, it, enclosing, an, expanded, city, and, using, more, sophisticated, designs, with, small, forts, at, intervals, the, romans, walled, major, cities, and, towns, in, areas, they, saw, as, vulnerable, and, parts, of, many, walls, remain, incorporated, in, later, defensive, fortifications, as, at, c, rdoba, 2nd, century, bc, chester, earth, and, wood, in, the, 70s, ad, stone, from, c, 100, and, york, from, 70s, ad, strategic, walls, across, open, country, were, far, rarer, and, hadrian, s, wall, from, 122, and, the, antonine, wall, from, 142, abandoned, only, 8, years, after, completion, are, the, most, significant, examples, both, on, the, pictish, frontier, of, roman, britain, on, his, return, from, campaigns, in, greece, the, general, sulla, brought, back, what, is, probably, the, best, known, element, of, the, early, imperial, period, the, mosaic, a, decoration, made, of, colourful, chips, of, stone, inserted, into, cement, this, tiling, method, took, the, empire, by, storm, in, the, late, first, century, and, the, second, century, and, in, the, roman, home, joined, the, well, known, mural, in, decorating, floors, walls, and, grottoes, with, geometric, and, pictorial, designs, there, were, two, main, techniques, in, greco, roman, mosaic, opus, vermiculatum, used, tiny, tesserae, typically, cubes, of, 4, millimeters, or, less, and, was, produced, in, workshops, in, relatively, small, panels, which, were, transported, to, the, site, glued, to, some, temporary, support, the, tiny, tesserae, allowed, very, fine, detail, and, an, approach, to, the, illusionism, of, painting, often, small, panels, called, emblemata, were, inserted, into, walls, or, as, the, highlights, of, larger, floor, mosaics, in, coarser, work, the, normal, technique, however, was, opus, tessellatum, using, larger, tesserae, which, were, laid, on, site, there, was, a, distinct, native, italian, style, using, black, on, a, white, background, which, was, no, doubt, cheaper, than, fully, coloured, work, a, specific, genre, of, roman, mosaic, obtained, the, name, asaroton, greek, unswept, floor, it, represented, an, optical, illusion, of, the, leftovers, from, a, feast, on, the, floor, of, rich, houses, a, hypocaust, was, an, ancient, roman, system, of, underfloor, heating, used, to, heat, buildings, with, hot, air, the, roman, architect, vitruvius, writing, about, the, end, of, the, 1st, century, bc, attributes, their, invention, to, sergius, orata, many, remains, of, roman, hypocausts, have, survived, throughout, europe, western, asia, and, northern, africa, the, hypocaust, was, an, invention, which, improved, the, hygiene, and, living, conditions, of, citizens, and, was, a, forerunner, of, modern, central, heating, hypocausts, were, used, for, heating, hot, baths, thermae, houses, and, other, buildings, whether, public, or, private, the, floor, was, raised, above, the, ground, by, pillars, called, pilae, stacks, with, a, layer, of, tiles, then, a, layer, of, concrete, then, another, of, tiles, on, top, and, spaces, were, left, inside, the, walls, so, that, hot, air, and, smoke, from, the, furnace, would, pass, through, these, enclosed, areas, and, out, of, flues, in, the, roof, thereby, heating, but, not, polluting, the, interior, of, the, room, in, magna, graecia, truss, roofs, presumably, appeared, as, early, as, 550, bc, their, potential, was, fully, realized, in, the, roman, period, which, saw, trussed, roofs, over, 30, meters, wide, spanning, the, rectangular, spaces, of, monumental, public, buildings, such, as, temples, basilicas, and, later, churches, such, spans, were, three, times, as, wide, as, the, widest, prop, and, lintel, roofs, and, only, surpassed, by, the, largest, roman, domes, the, largest, truss, roof, by, span, of, ancient, rome, covered, the, aula, regia, throne, room, built, for, emperor, domitian, 81, 96, ad, on, the, palatine, hill, rome, the, timber, truss, roof, had, a, width, of, 31, 67, m, slightly, surpassing, the, postulated, limit, of, 30, m, for, roman, roof, constructions, tie, beam, trusses, allowed, for, much, larger, spans, than, the, older, prop, and, lintel, system, and, even, concrete, vaulting, nine, out, of, the, ten, largest, rectangular, spaces, in, roman, architecture, were, bridged, this, way, the, only, exception, being, the, groin, vaulted, basilica, of, maxentius, the, spiral, stair, is, a, type, of, stairway, which, due, to, its, complex, helical, structure, was, introduced, relatively, late, into, architecture, although, the, oldest, example, dates, to, the, 5th, century, bc, it, was, only, in, the, wake, of, the, influential, design, of, trajan, s, column, that, this, space, saving, new, type, permanently, caught, hold, in, roman, architecture, apart, from, the, triumphal, columns, in, the, imperial, cities, of, rome, and, constantinople, other, types, of, buildings, such, as, temples, thermae, basilicas, and, tombs, were, also, fitted, with, spiral, stairways, their, notable, absence, in, the, towers, of, the, aurelian, wall, indicates, that, although, used, in, medieval, castles, they, did, not, yet, figure, prominently, in, roman, military, engineering, by, late, antiquity, separate, stair, towers, were, constructed, adjacent, to, the, main, buildings, as, in, the, basilica, of, san, vitale, the, construction, of, spiral, stairs, passed, on, both, to, christian, and, islamic, architecture, the, ancient, romans, employed, regular, orthogonal, structures, on, which, they, molded, their, colonies, they, probably, were, inspired, by, greek, and, hellenic, examples, as, well, as, by, regularly, planned, cities, that, were, built, by, the, etruscans, in, italy, see, marzabotto, the, romans, used, a, consolidated, scheme, for, city, planning, developed, for, military, defense, and, civil, convenience, the, basic, plan, consisted, of, a, central, forum, with, city, services, surrounded, by, a, compact, rectilinear, grid, of, streets, and, wrapped, in, a, wall, for, defense, to, reduce, travel, times, two, diagonal, streets, crossed, the, square, grid, passing, through, the, central, square, a, river, usually, flowed, through, the, city, providing, water, transport, and, sewage, disposal, hundreds, of, towns, and, cities, were, built, by, the, romans, throughout, their, empire, many, european, towns, such, as, turin, preserve, the, remains, of, these, schemes, which, show, the, very, logical, way, the, romans, designed, their, cities, they, would, lay, out, the, streets, at, right, angles, in, the, form, of, a, square, grid, all, roads, were, equal, in, width, and, length, except, for, two, which, were, slightly, wider, than, the, others, one, of, these, ran, east, west, the, other, north, south, and, they, intersected, in, the, middle, to, form, the, center, of, the, grid, all, roads, were, made, of, carefully, fitted, flagstones, and, filled, in, with, smaller, hard, packed, rocks, and, pebbles, bridges, were, constructed, where, needed, each, square, marked, off, by, four, roads, was, called, an, insula, the, roman, equivalent, of, a, modern, city, block, each, insula, was, 80, yards, 73, m, square, with, the, land, within, it, divided, as, the, city, developed, each, insula, would, eventually, be, filled, with, buildings, of, various, shapes, and, sizes, and, crisscrossed, with, back, roads, and, alleys, most, insulae, were, given, to, the, first, settlers, of, a, roman, city, but, each, person, had, to, pay, to, construct, his, own, house, the, city, was, surrounded, by, a, wall, to, protect, it, from, invaders, and, to, mark, the, city, limits, areas, outside, city, limits, were, left, open, as, farmland, at, the, end, of, each, main, road, was, a, large, gateway, with, watchtowers, a, portcullis, covered, the, opening, when, the, city, was, under, siege, and, additional, watchtowers, were, constructed, along, the, city, walls, an, aqueduct, was, built, outside, the, city, walls, the, development, of, greek, and, roman, urbanization, is, well, known, as, there, are, relatively, many, written, sources, and, there, has, been, much, attention, to, the, subject, since, the, romans, and, greeks, are, generally, regarded, as, the, main, ancestors, of, modern, western, culture, it, should, not, be, forgotten, though, that, the, etruscans, had, many, considerable, towns, and, there, were, also, other, cultures, with, more, or, less, urban, settlements, in, europe, primarily, of, celtic, origin
