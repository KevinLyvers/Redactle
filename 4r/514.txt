united, states, but, that, also, includes, examples, from, many, countries, as, a, trend, land, art, expanded, boundaries, of, art, by, the, materials, used, and, the, siting, of, the, works, the, materials, used, were, often, the, materials, of, the, earth, including, the, soil, rocks, vegetation, and, water, found, on, site, and, the, sites, of, the, works, were, often, distant, from, population, centers, though, sometimes, fairly, inaccessible, photo, documentation, was, commonly, brought, back, to, the, urban, art, gallery, concerns, of, the, art, movement, centered, around, rejection, of, the, commercialization, of, art, making, and, enthusiasm, with, an, emergent, ecological, movement, the, art, movement, coincided, with, the, popularity, of, the, rejection, of, urban, living, and, its, counterpart, an, enthusiasm, for, that, which, is, rural, included, in, these, inclinations, were, spiritual, yearnings, concerning, the, planet, earth, as, home, to, humanity, the, art, form, gained, traction, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, as, land, art, was, not, something, that, could, easily, be, turned, into, a, commodity, unlike, the, mass, produced, cultural, debris, of, the, time, during, this, period, proponents, of, land, art, rejected, the, museum, or, gallery, as, the, setting, of, artistic, activity, and, developed, monumental, landscape, projects, which, were, beyond, the, reach, of, traditional, transportable, sculpture, and, the, commercial, art, market, although, photographic, documentation, was, often, presented, in, normal, gallery, spaces, land, art, was, inspired, by, minimal, art, and, conceptual, art, but, also, by, modern, movements, such, as, de, stijl, cubism, minimalism, and, the, work, of, constantin, br, ncu, i, and, joseph, beuys, one, of, the, first, earthworks, artists, was, herbert, bayer, who, created, grass, mound, in, aspen, colorado, in, 1955, many, of, the, artists, associated, with, land, art, had, been, involved, with, minimal, art, and, conceptual, art, isamu, noguchi, s, 1941, design, for, contoured, playground, in, new, york, city, is, sometimes, interpreted, as, an, important, early, piece, of, land, art, even, though, the, artist, himself, never, called, his, work, land, art, but, simply, sculpture, his, influence, on, contemporary, land, art, landscape, architecture, and, environmental, sculpture, is, evident, in, many, works, today, alan, sonfist, used, an, alternative, approach, to, working, with, nature, and, culture, by, bringing, historical, nature, and, sustainable, art, back, into, new, york, city, his, most, inspirational, work, is, time, landscape, an, indigenous, forest, he, planted, in, new, york, city, he, created, several, other, time, landscapes, around, the, world, such, as, circles, of, time, in, florence, italy, documenting, the, historical, usage, of, the, land, and, at, the, decordova, sculpture, park, and, museum, outside, boston, according, to, critic, barbara, rose, writing, in, artforum, in, 1969, he, had, become, disillusioned, with, the, commodification, and, insularity, of, gallery, bound, art, in, 1967, the, art, critic, grace, glueck, writing, in, the, new, york, times, declared, the, first, earthwork, to, be, done, by, douglas, leichter, and, richard, saba, at, the, skowhegan, school, of, painting, and, sculpture, the, sudden, appearance, of, land, art, in, 1968, can, be, located, as, a, response, by, a, generation, of, artists, mostly, in, their, late, twenties, to, the, heightened, political, activism, of, the, year, and, the, emerging, environmental, and, women, s, liberation, movements, one, example, of, land, art, in, the, 20th, century, was, a, group, exhibition, called, earthworks, created, in, 1968, at, the, dwan, gallery, in, new, york, in, february, 1969, willoughby, sharp, curated, the, earth, art, exhibition, at, the, andrew, dickson, white, museum, of, art, at, cornell, university, ithaca, new, york, the, artists,

the, exhibition, was, directed, by, thomas, w, leavitt, gordon, matta, clark, who, lived, in, ithaca, at, the, time, was, invited, by, sharp, to, help, the, artists, in, earth, art, with, the, on, site, execution, of, their, works, for, the, exhibition, perhaps, the, best, known, artist, who, worked, in, this, genre, was, robert, smithson, whose, 1968, essay, the, sedimentation, of, the, mind, earth, projects, provided, a, critical, framework, for, the, movement, as, a, reaction, to, the, disengagement, of, modernism, from, social, issues, as, represented, by, the, critic, clement, greenberg, his, best, known, piece, and, probably, the, most, famous, piece, of, all, land, art, is, the, spiral, jetty, 1970, for, which, smithson, arranged, rock, earth, and, algae, so, as, to, form, a, long, 1500, ft, spiral, shape, jetty, protruding, into, great, salt, lake, in, northern, utah, u, s, how, much, of, the, work, if, any, is, visible, is, dependent, on, the, fluctuating, water, levels, since, its, creation, the, work, has, been, completely, covered, and, then, uncovered, again, by, water, a, steward, of, the, artwork, in, conjunction, with, the, dia, foundation, the, utah, museum, of, fine, arts, regularly, curates, programming, around, the, spiral, jetty, including, a, family, backpacks, program, smithson, s, gravel, mirror, with, cracks, and, dust, 1968, is, an, example, of, land, art, existing, in, a, gallery, space, rather, than, in, the, natural, environment, it, consists, of, a, pile, of, gravel, by, the, side, of, a, partially, mirrored, gallery, wall, in, its, simplicity, of, form, and, concentration, on, the, materials, themselves, this, and, other, pieces, of, land, art, have, an, affinity, with, minimalism, there, is, also, a, relationship, to, arte, povera, in, the, use, of, materials, traditionally, considered, unartistic, or, worthless, the, italian, germano, celant, founder, of, arte, povera, was, one, of, the, first, curators, to, promote, land, art, land, artists, have, tended, to, be, american, with, other, prominent, artists, in, this, field, being, carl, andre, alice, aycock, walter, de, maria, hans, haacke, michael,

piece, of, land, art, thus, far, reshaping, the, earth, surrounding, the, extinct, roden, crater, volcano, in, arizona, perhaps, the, most, prominent, non, american, land, artists, are, the, british,

for, the, nature, to, create, art, some, projects, by, the, artists, christo, and, jeanne, claude, who, are, famous, for, wrapping, monuments, buildings, and, landscapes, in, fabric, have, also, been, considered, land, art, by, some, though, the, artists, themselves, consider, this, incorrect, joseph, beuys, s, concept, of, social, sculpture, influenced, land, art, and, his, 7000, eichen, project,

up, to, three, geoglyphs, ranging, in, size, up, to, 40, 000, sq, m, 430, 560, sq, ft, are, located, in, each, site, land, artists, in, america, relied, mostly, on, wealthy, patrons, and, private, foundations, to, fund, their, often, costly, projects, with, the, sudden, economic, downturn, of, the, mid, 1970s, funds, from, these, sources, largely, stopped, with, the, death, of, robert, smithson, in, a, plane, crash, in, 1973, the, movement, lost, one, of, its, most, important, figureheads, and, faded, out, charles, ross, continues, to, work, on, the, star, axis, project, which, he, began, in, 1971, michael, heizer, in, 2022, completed, his, work, on, city, and, james, turrell, continues, to, work, on, the, roden, crater, project, in, most, respects, land, art, has, become, part, of, mainstream, public, art, and, in, many, cases, the, term, land, art, is, misused, to, label, any, kind, of, art, in, nature, even, though, conceptually, not, related, to, the, avant, garde, works, by, the, pioneers, of, land, art, the, earth, art, of, the, 1960s, were, sometimes, reminiscent, of, much, older, land, works, such, as, stonehenge, the, pyramids, native, american, mounds, the, nazca, lines, in, peru, carnac, stones, and, native, american, burial, grounds, and, often, evoked, the, spirituality, of, such, archeological, sites
