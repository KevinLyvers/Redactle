departed, from, edo, modern, day, tokyo, for, the, northerly, interior, region, known, as, oku, propelled, mostly, by, a, desire, to, see, the, places, about, which, the, old, poets, wrote, in, an, effort, to, renew, his, own, art, specifically, he, was, emulating, saigy, whom, bash, praised, as, the, greatest, waka, poet, bash, made, a, point, of, visiting, all, the, sites, mentioned, in, saigy, s, verse, travel, in, those, days, was, very, dangerous, but, bash, was, committed, to, a, kind, of, poetic, ideal, of, wandering, he, traveled, for, about, 156, days, altogether, covering, almost, 1, 500, miles, 2, 400, km, mostly, on, foot, of, all, of, bash, s, works, this, is, the, best, known, this, poetic, diary, is, in, the, form, known, as, haibun, a, combination, of, prose, and,

reworking, the, poems, and, prose, of, oku, no, hosomichi, before, publishing, it, based, on, differences, between, draft, versions, of, the, account, sora, s, diary, and, the, final, version, it, is, clear, that, bash, took, a, number, of, artistic, liberties, in, the, writing, an, example, of, this, is, that, in, the, senj, shu, selection, of, tales, attributed, to, saigy, the, narrator, is, passing, through, eguchi, when, he, is, driven, by, a, storm, to, seek, shelter, in, the, nearby, cottage, of, a, prostitute, this, leads, to, an, exchange, of, poems, after, which, he, spends, the, night, there, bash, similarly, includes, in, oku, no, hosomichi, a, tale, of, him, having, an, exchange, with, prostitutes, staying, in, the, same, inn, but, sora, mentions, nothing, nobuyuki, yuasa, notes, that, bash, studied, zen, meditation, under, the, guidance, of, the, priest, buccho, though, it, is, uncertain, whether, bash, ever, attained, enlightenment, the, japanese, zen, scholar, d, t, suzuki, has, described, bash, s, philosophy, in, writing, poetry, as, one, requiring, that, both, subject, and, object, were, entirely, annihilated, in, meditative, experience, yuasa, likewise, writes, bash, had, been, casting, away, his, earthly, attachments, one, by, one, in, the, years, preceding, the, journey, and, now, he, had, nothing, else, to, cast, away, but, his, own, self, which, was, in, him, as, well, as, around, him, he, had, to, cast, this, self, away, for, otherwise, he, was, not, able, to, restore, his, true, identity, what, he, calls, the, everlasting, self, which, is, poetry, yuasa, notes, the, narrow, road, to, the, deep, north, is, bash, s, study, in, eternity, and, in, so, far, as, he, has, succeeded, in, this, attempt, it, is, also, a, monument, he, has, set, up, against, the, flow, of, time
