innovative, in, the, 1950s, its, humor, is, psychologically, complex, and, driven, by, the, characters, interactions, and, relationships, the, comic, strip, has, been, adapted, in, animation, and, theater, schulz, drew, the, strip, for, nearly, 50, years, with, no, assistants, even, in, the, lettering, and, coloring, process, peanuts, was, originally, sold, under, the, title, of, li, l, folks, but, that, had, been, used, before, so, they, said, we, have, to, think, of, another, title, i, couldn, t, think, of, one, and, somebody, at, united, features, came, up, with, the, miserable, title, peanuts, which, i, hate, and, have, always, hated, it, has, no, dignity, and, it, s, not, descriptive, what, could, i, do, here, i, was, an, unknown, kid, from, st, paul, i, couldn, t, think, of, anything, else, i, said, why, don, t, we, call, it, charlie, brown, and, the, president, said, well, we, can, t, copyright, a, name, like, that, i, didn, t, ask, them, about, nancy, or, steve, canyon, i, was, in, no, position, to, argue, charles, schulz, in, a, 1987, interview, with, frank, pauer, in, dayton, daily, news, and, journal, herald, magazine, peanuts, had, its, origin, in, li, l, folks, a, weekly, panel, cartoon, that, appeared, in, schulz, s, hometown, newspaper, the, st, paul, pioneer, press, from, 1947, to, 1950, elementary, details, of, the, cartoon, shared, similarities, to, peanuts, the, name, charlie, brown, was, first, used, there, the, series, also, had, a, dog, that, looked, much, like, the, early, 1950s, version, of, snoopy, schulz, submitted, his, li, l, folks, cartoons, to, united, features, syndicate, ufs, who, responded, with, interest, he, visited, the, syndicate, in, new, york, city, and, presented, a, package, of, new, comic, strips, he, had, worked, on, rather, than, the, panel, cartoons, he, submitted, ufs, found, they, preferred, the, comic, strip, when, ufs, was, preparing, to, syndicate, the, comic, strip, as, li, l, folk, tack, knight, who, authored, the, retired, 1930s, comic, strip, little, folks, sought, to, claim, exclusive, rights, to, the, title, being, used, schulz, argued, in, a, letter, to, knight, that, the, contraction, of, little, to, li, l, was, intended, to, avoid, this, conflict, but, conceded, that, the, final, decision, would, be, for, the, syndicate, a, different, name, for, the, comic, strip, became, necessary, after, legal, advice, confirmed, that, little, folks, was, a, registered, trademark, meanwhile, the, production, manager, of, ufs, noted, the, popularity, of, the, children, s, program, howdy, doody, the, show, featured, an, audience, of, children, who, were, seated, in, the, peanut, gallery, and, were, referred, to, as, peanuts, this, inspired, the, decided, title, that, was, forced, upon, schulz, to, his, consternation, schulz, hated, the, title, peanuts, which, remained, a, source, of, irritation, to, him, throughout, his, life, he, accused, the, production, manager, at, ufs, of, not, having, even, seen, the, comic, strip, before, giving, it, a, title, and, he, said, that, the, title, would, only, make, sense, if, there, was, a, character, named, peanuts, on, the, day, it, was, syndicated, schulz, s, friend, visited, a, news, stand, in, uptown, minneapolis, and, asked, if, there, were, any, newspapers, that, carried, peanuts, to, which, the, newsdealer, replied, no, and, we, don, t, have, any, with, popcorn, either, which, confirmed, schulz, s, fears, concerning, the, title, whenever, schulz, was, asked, what, he, did, for, a, living, he, would, evade, mentioning, the, title, and, say, i, draw, that, comic, strip, with, snoopy, in, it, charlie, brown, and, his, dog, in, 1997, schulz, said, that, he, had, discussed, changing, the, title, to, charlie, brown, on, multiple, occasions, in, the, past, but, found, that, it, would, ultimately, cause, problems, with, licensees, who, already, incorporated, the, existing, title, into, their, products, with, unnecessary, expenses, involved, for, all, downstream, licensees, to, change, it, the, strip, began, as, a, daily, strip, on, october, 2, 1950, in, seven, newspapers, the, minneapolis, star, a, hometown, newspaper, of, schulz, page, 37, along, with, a, short, article, the, washington, post, chicago, tribune, the, denver, post, the, seattle, times, and, two, newspapers, in, pennsylvania, evening, chronicle, allentown, and, globe, times, bethlehem, the, first, strip, was, four, panels, long, and, showed, charlie, brown, walking, by, two, other, young, children, shermy, and, patty, shermy, lauds, charlie, brown, as, he, walks, by, but, then, tells, patty, how, he, hates, him, in, the, final, panel, snoopy, was, also, an, early, character, in, the, strip, first, appearing, in, the, third, strip, which, ran, on, october, 4, its, first, sunday, strip, appeared, january, 6, 1952, in, the, half, page, format, which, was, the, only, complete, format, for, the, entire, life, of, the, sunday, strip, most, of, the, other, characters, that, eventually, became, regulars, of, the, strip, did, not, appear, until, later, violet, february, 1951, schroeder, may, 1951, lucy, march, 1952, linus, september, 1952, pig, pen, july, 1954, sally, august, 1959, frieda, march, 1961, peppermint, patty, august, 1966, franklin, july, 1968, woodstock, introduced, march, 1966, officially, named, june, 1970, marcie, july, 1971, and, rerun, march, 1973, schulz, decided, to, produce, all, aspects, of, the, strip, himself, from, the, script, to, the, finished, art, and, lettering, schulz, did, however, hire, help, to, produce, the, comic, book, adaptations, of, peanuts, thus, the, strip, was, able, to, be, presented, with, a, unified, tone, and, schulz, was, able, to, employ, a, minimalistic, style, backgrounds, were, generally, not, used, and, when, they, were, schulz, s, frazzled, lines, imbued, them, with, a, fraught, psychological, appearance, this, style, has, been, described, by, art, critic, john, carlin, as, forcing, its, readers, to, focus, on, subtle, nuances, rather, than, broad, actions, or, sharp, transitions, schulz, held, this, belief, all, his, life, reaffirming, in, 1994, the, importance, of, crafting, the, strip, himself, this, is, not, a, crazy, business, about, slinging, ink, this, is, a, deadly, serious, business, while, the, strip, in, its, early, years, resembles, its, later, form, there, are, significant, differences, the, art, was, cleaner, sleeker, and, simpler, with, thicker, lines, and, short, squat, characters, for, example, in, these, early, strips, charlie, brown, s, famous, round, head, is, closer, to, the, shape, of, an, american, football, or, rugby, football, most, of, the, kids, were, initially, fairly, round, headed, as, another, example, all, the, characters, except, charlie, brown, had, their, mouths, longer, and, had, smaller, eyes, when, they, looked, sideways, the, 1960s, is, generally, considered, to, be, the, golden, age, for, peanuts, during, this, period, some, of, the, strip, s, best, known, themes, and, characters, appeared, including, peppermint, patty, snoopy, as, the, world, war, one, flying, ace, frieda, and, her, naturally, curly, hair, and, franklin, peanuts, is, remarkable, for, its, deft, social, commentary, especially, compared, with, other, strips, appearing, in, the, 1950s, and, early, 1960s, schulz, did, not, explicitly, address, racial, and, gender, equality, issues, so, much, as, assume, them, to, be, self, evident, peppermint, patty, s, athletic, skill, and, self, confidence, are, simply, taken, for, granted, for, example, as, is, franklin, s, presence, in, a, racially, integrated, school, and, neighborhood, franklin, s, creation, occurred, at, least, in, part, as, a, result, of, schulz, s, 1968, correspondence, with, a, socially, progressive, fan, the, fact, that, charlie, brown, s, baseball, team, had, three, girls, on, it, was, also, at, least, ten, years, ahead, of, its, time, the, 1966, prime, time, television, special, charlie, brown, s, all, stars, dealt, with, charlie, brown, refusing, sponsorship, of, his, team, on, the, condition, he, fire, the, girls, and, snoopy, because, the, league, does, not, allow, girls, or, dogs, to, play, schulz, threw, satirical, barbs, at, any, number, of, topics, when, he, chose, his, child, and, animal, characters, satirized, the, adult, world, over, the, years, he, tackled, everything, from, the, vietnam, war, to, school, dress, codes, to, new, math, the, may, 20, 1962, strip, featured, an, icon, that, stated, defend, freedom, buy, u, s, savings, bonds, in, 1963, he, added, a, little, boy, named, 5, to, the, cast, whose, sisters, were, named, 3, and, 4, and, whose, father, had, changed, their, family, name, to, their, zip, code, giving, in, to, the, way, numbers, were, taking, over, people, s, identities, also, in, 1963, one, strip, showed, sally, being, secretive, about, school, prayer, in, reference, to, the, supreme, court, decisions, on, it, that, year, in, 1958, a, strip, in, which, snoopy, tossed, linus, into, the, air, and, boasted, that, he, was, the, first, dog, ever, to, launch, a, human, parodied, the, hype, associated, with, sputnik, 2, s, launch, of, laika, the, dog, into, space, earlier, that, year, another, sequence, lampooned, little, leagues, and, organized, play, when, all, the, neighborhood, kids, join, snowman, building, leagues, and, criticize, charlie, brown, when, he, insists, on, building, his, own, snowmen, without, leagues, or, coaches, peanuts, touched, on, religious, themes, on, many, occasions, especially, during, the, 1960s, the, classic, television, special, a, charlie, brown, christmas, from, 1965, features, the, character, linus, van, pelt, quoting, the, king, james, version, of, the, bible, luke, 2, 8, 14, to, explain, to, charlie, brown, what, christmas, is, all, about, in, personal, interviews, schulz, mentioned, that, linus, represented, his, spiritual, side, because, of, the, explicit, religious, material, in, a, charlie, brown, christmas, many, have, interpreted, schulz, s, work, as, having, a, distinct, christian, theme, though, the, popular, perspective, has, been, to, view, the, franchise, through, a, secular, lens, during, the, week, of, july, 29, 1968, schulz, debuted, the, african, american, character, franklin, to, the, strip, at, the, urging, of, white, jewish, los, angeles, schoolteacher, harriet, glickman, though, schulz, feared, that, adding, a, black, character, would, be, seen, as, patronizing, to, the, african, american, community, glickman, convinced, him, that, the, addition, of, black, characters, could, help, normalize, the, idea, of, friendships, between, children, of, different, ethnicities, franklin, appeared, in, a, trio, of, strips, set, at, a, beach, in, which, he, first, gets, charlie, brown, s, beach, ball, from, the, water, and, subsequently, helps, him, build, a, sand, castle, during, which, he, mentions, that, his, father, is, in, vietnam, in, 1975, the, panel, format, was, shortened, slightly, horizontally, and, shortly, thereafter, the, lettering, became, larger, to, compensate, previously, the, daily, peanuts, strips, were, formatted, in, a, four, panel, space, saving, format, beginning, in, the, 1950s, with, a, few, very, rare, eight, panel, strips, that, still, fit, into, the, four, panel, mold, beginning, on, leap, day, in, 1988, schulz, abandoned, the, four, panel, format, in, favor, of, three, panel, dailies, and, occasionally, used, the, entire, length, of, the, strip, as, one, panel, partly, for, experimentation, but, also, to, combat, the, dwindling, size, of, the, comics, page, in, the, late, 1970s, during, schulz, s, negotiations, with, united, feature, syndicate, over, a, new, contract, syndicate, president, william, c, payette, hired, superhero, comic, artist, al, plastino, to, draw, a, backlog, of, peanuts, strips, to, hold, in, reserve, in, case, schulz, left, the, strip, when, schulz, and, the, syndicate, reached, a, successful, agreement, united, media, stored, these, unpublished, strips, the, existence, of, which, eventually, became, public, plastino, himself, also, claimed, to, have, ghostwritten, for, schulz, while, schulz, underwent, heart, surgery, in, 1983, in, the, 1980s, and, the, 1990s, the, strip, remained, the, most, popular, comic, in, history, even, though, other, comics, such, as, garfield, and, calvin, and, hobbes, rivaled, peanuts, in, popularity, schulz, continued, to, write, the, strip, until, announcing, his, retirement, on, december, 14, 1999, due, to, his, failing, health, the, last, three, peanuts, strips, were, run, from, saturday, january, 1, 2000, through, monday, january, 3, 2000, the, saturday, strip, showed, a, snowball, fight, between, peppermint, patty, and, marcie, and, charlie, brown, and, linus, with, snoopy, sitting, behind, the, fight, trying, to, figure, out, how, to, throw, a, snowball, the, strip, was, notable, because, in, addition, to, it, being, the, last, daily, strip, with, a, story, schulz, s, health, had, deteriorated, to, the, point, where, the, lettering, in, the, strip, had, to, be, done, by, computer, the, sunday, strip, featured, the, last, appearances, of, peppermint, patty, and, marcie, with, peppermint, patty, playing, a, game, of, football, in, the, rain, by, herself, marcie, comes, up, carrying, an, umbrella, and, remarking, that, everyone, has, gone, home, peppermint, patty, laments, that, they, never, shook, hands, and, said, good, game, the, january, 3, strip, consisted, of, a, drawing, of, snoopy, sitting, atop, his, doghouse, with, his, typewriter, as, he, had, done, many, times, over, the, course, of, the, strip, s, lifespan, the, drawing, was, accompanied, by, a, printed, note, from, schulz, which, officially, announced, his, retirement, from, drawing, and, thanking, his, readers, for, their, support, although, a, series, of, reruns, of, older, strips, would, begin, on, january, 4, 2000, there, were, still, six, unpublished, sunday, strips, that, schulz, had, completed, the, first, of, these, ran, on, january, 9, featuring, rerun, and, snoopy, playing, in, the, snow, the, second, featured, the, last, appearance, of, woodstock, as, he, and, snoopy, in, one, last, fantasy, sequence, are, called, upon, by, george, washington, to, chop, firewood, rerun, makes, his, final, appearance, in, the, fourth, trying, to, paint, something, other, than, flowers, in, art, class, and, sally, makes, her, last, appearance, in, the, fifth, conversing, with, charlie, brown, about, love, letters, the, final, peanuts, strip, as, shown, here, ran, on, february, 13, 2000, the, night, after, schulz, died, from, a, heart, attack, it, consisted, of, two, small, panels, across, the, top, and, a, large, panel, at, the, bottom, the, title, panel, shows, charlie, brown, talking, to, someone, on, the, telephone, who, is, apparently, asking, to, speak, to, snoopy, charlie, brown, responds, by, telling, the, caller, no, i, think, he, s, writing, the, second, panel, shows, snoopy, sitting, atop, his, doghouse, typing, on, his, typewriter, as, he, had, many, times, before, while, the, words, dear, friends, appeared, above, his, head, the, larger, panel, at, the, bottom, consisted, of, a, larger, scale, drawing, of, the, final, daily, strip, with, snoopy, against, a, blue, sky, background, above, his, head, several, panels, from, past, strips, were, overlaid, underneath, these, panels, the, full, note, that, schulz, had, written, to, his, fans, was, printed, part, of, it, had, been, omitted, in, the, final, daily, strip, it, read, as, follows, dear, friends, i, have, been, fortunate, to, draw, charlie, brown, and, his, friends, for, almost, fifty, years, it, has, been, the, fulfillment, of, my, childhood, ambition, unfortunately, i, am, no, longer, able, to, maintain, the, schedule, demanded, by, a, daily, comic, strip, my, family, does, not, wish, peanuts, to, be, continued, by, anyone, else, therefore, i, am, announcing, my, retirement, i, have, been, grateful, over, the, years, for, the, loyalty, of, our, editors, and, the, wonderful, support, and, love, expressed, to, me, by, fans, of, the, comic, strip, charlie, brown, snoopy, linus, lucy, how, can, i, ever, forget, them, many, other, cartoonists, paid, tribute, to, peanuts, and, schulz, by, homages, in, their, own, strips, appearing, on, february, 13, 2000, or, in, the, week, beforehand, the, comic, was, reprinted, the, day, after, that, but, only, had, the, farewell, letter, after, peanuts, ended, united, feature, syndicate, began, offering, the, newspapers, that, ran, it, a, package, of, reprinted, strips, under, the, title, classic, peanuts, the, syndicate, limited, the, choices, to, either, strips, from, the, 1960s, or, from, the, 1990s, although, a, newspaper, was, also, given, the, option, to, carry, both, reprint, packages, if, it, desired, all, sunday, strips, in, the, package, however, come, from, the, 1960s, peanuts, continues, to, be, prevalent, in, multiple, media, through, widespread, syndication, the, publication, of, the, complete, peanuts, the, release, of, several, new, television, specials, all, of, which, schulz, had, worked, on, but, had, not, finished, before, his, death, and, peanuts, motion, comics, additionally, boom, studios, has, published, a, series, of, comic, books, that, feature, new, material, by, new, writers, and, artists, although, some, of, it, is, based, on, classic, schulz, stories, from, decades, past, as, well, as, including, some, classic, strips, by, schulz, mostly, sunday, color, strips, in, early, 2011, united, media, the, parent, of, united, feature, syndicate, struck, a, distribution, deal, with, universal, uclick, now, known, as, andrews, mcmeel, syndication, for, syndication, of, the, company, s, 150, comic, strip, and, news, features, including, peanuts, on, january, 5, 2015, universal, uclick, s, website, gocomics, announced, on, that, it, would, be, launching, peanuts, begins, a, feature, rerunning, the, entire, history, of, the, strip, from, the, beginning, in, colorized, form, this, was, done, to, honor, the, 65th, anniversary, of, the, strip, s, debut, charlie, brown, is, a, young, boy, he, is, the, main, character, acting, as, the, center, of, the, strip, s, world, and, serving, as, an, everyman, while, seen, as, decent, considerate, and, reflective, he, is, also, awkward, deeply, sensitive, and, said, to, suffer, from, an, inferiority, complex, charlie, brown, is, a, constant, failure, he, can, never, win, a, ballgame, he, can, never, successfully, fly, a, kite, his, sense, of, determination, regardless, of, the, certainty, of, failure, can, be, interpreted, as, either, self, defeating, stubbornness, or, admirable, persistence, when, he, fails, however, he, experiences, pain, and, anguish, through, self, pity, the, journalist, christopher, caldwell, observed, this, tension, between, charlie, brown, s, negative, and, positive, attitudes, stating, what, makes, charlie, brown, such, a, rich, character, is, that, he, s, not, purely, a, loser, the, self, loathing, that, causes, him, so, much, anguish, is, decidedly, not, self, effacement, charlie, brown, is, optimistic, enough, to, think, he, can, earn, a, sense, of, self, worth, schulz, named, charlie, brown, after, a, colleague, of, his, while, working, at, art, instruction, whose, full, name, was, charlie, francis, brown, readers, and, critics, have, explored, the, question, as, to, whether, schulz, based, charlie, brown, on, himself, this, question, often, carried, the, suggestion, that, the, emotionally, sensitive, and, depressed, behavior, of, charlie, brown, drew, from, schulz, s, own, life, or, childhood, experiences, commenting, on, the, tendency, of, these, conclusions, being, drawn, schulz, said, in, a, 1968, interview, i, think, of, myself, as, charles, schulz, but, if, someone, wants, to, believe, i, m, really, charlie, brown, well, it, makes, a, good, story, he, explained, in, another, interview, that, the, comic, strip, as, a, whole, is, a, personal, expression, and, so, it, is, impossible, to, avoid, all, the, characters, presenting, aspects, of, his, personality, biographer, david, michaelis, made, a, similar, conclusion, describing, charlie, brown, as, simply, representing, schulz, s, wishy, washiness, and, determination, regardless, some, profiles, of, schulz, confidently, held, that, charlie, brown, was, based, on, him, snoopy, is, a, dog, who, later, in, the, development, of, the, strip, would, be, described, as, a, beagle, while, generally, behaving, like, a, real, dog, and, having, a, non, speaking, role, he, connects, to, readers, through, having, human, thoughts, despite, acting, like, a, real, dog, some, of, the, time, snoopy, possesses, many, different, anthropomorphic, traits, most, notably, he, frequently, walks, on, his, hind, legs, and, is, able, to, use, tools, including, his, typewriter, he, introduces, fantasy, elements, to, the, strip, by, extending, his, identity, through, various, alter, egos, many, of, these, alter, egos, such, as, a, world, famous, attorney, surgeon, or, secret, agent, were, seen, only, once, or, twice, his, character, is, a, mixture, of, innocence, and, egotism, he, possesses, childlike, joy, while, on, occasion, being, somewhat, selfish, he, has, an, arrogant, commitment, to, his, independence, but, is, often, shown, to, be, dependent, on, humans, schulz, was, careful, in, balancing, snoopy, s, life, between, that, of, a, real, dog, and, that, of, a, fantastical, character, while, the, interior, of, snoopy, s, small, doghouse, is, described, in, the, strip, as, having, such, things, as, a, library, and, a, pool, table, and, being, adorned, with, paintings, of, wyeth, and, van, gogh, it, was, never, shown, it, would, have, demanded, an, inappropriate, kind, of, suspension, of, disbelief, from, readers, linus, and, lucy, are, siblings, linus, is, the, younger, brother, and, lucy, is, the, older, sister, lucy, is, bossy, selfish, and, opinionated, and, she, often, delivers, commentary, in, an, honest, albeit, offensive, and, sarcastic, way, schulz, described, lucy, as, full, of, misdirected, confidence, but, having, the, virtue, of, being, capable, of, cutting, right, down, to, the, truth, he, said, that, lucy, is, mean, because, it, is, funny, particularly, because, she, is, a, girl, he, posited, that, a, boy, being, mean, to, girls, would, not, be, funny, at, all, describing, a, pattern, in, comic, strip, writing, where, it, is, comical, when, supposedly, weak, characters, dominate, supposedly, strong, characters, lucy, at, times, acts, as, a, psychiatrist, and, charges, five, cents, for, psychiatric, advice, to, other, characters, usually, charlie, brown, from, her, psychiatric, booth, a, booth, parodying, the, setup, of, a, lemonade, stand, lucy, s, role, as, a, psychiatrist, has, attracted, attention, from, real, life, individuals, in, the, field, of, psychology, the, psychiatrist, athar, yawar, playfully, identified, various, moments, in, the, strip, where, her, activities, could, be, characterized, as, pursuing, medical, and, scientific, interests, commenting, that, lucy, is, very, much, the, modern, doctor, linus, is, charlie, brown, s, most, loyal, and, uplifting, friend, and, introduces, intellectual, spiritual, and, reflective, elements, to, the, strip, he, offers, opinions, on, topics, such, as, literature, art, science, politics, and, theology, he, possesses, a, sense, of, morality, and, ethical, judgment, that, enables, him, to, navigate, topics, such, as, faith, intolerance, and, depression, schulz, enjoyed, the, adaptability, of, his, character, remarking, he, can, be, very, smart, as, well, as, dumb, he, has, a, tendency, of, expressing, lofty, or, pompous, ideas, that, are, quickly, rebuked, he, finds, psychological, security, from, thumb, sucking, and, holding, a, blanket, for, comfort, the, idea, of, his, security, blanket, originated, from, schulz, s, own, observation, of, his, first, three, children, who, carried, around, blankets, schulz, described, linus, s, blanket, as, probably, the, single, best, thing, that, i, ever, thought, of, he, was, proud, of, its, versatility, for, visual, humor, in, the, strip, and, with, how, the, phrase, security, blanket, entered, the, dictionary, peppermint, patty, and, marcie, are, two, girls, who, are, friends, they, attend, a, different, school, than, charlie, brown, on, the, other, side, of, town, and, so, represent, a, slightly, different, social, circle, from, the, other, characters, peppermint, patty, is, a, tomboy, who, is, forthright, and, loyal, and, has, what, schulz, described, as, a, devastating, singleness, of, purpose, she, frequently, misunderstands, things, to, the, extent, that, her, confusion, serves, as, the, premise, of, many, individual, strips, and, stories, in, one, story, she, prepares, for, a, skating, competition, only, to, learn, with, disastrous, results, that, it, is, for, roller, skating, and, not, ice, skating, she, struggles, at, school, and, with, her, homework, and, often, falls, asleep, in, school, the, wife, of, charles, schulz, jean, schulz, suggested, that, this, is, the, consequence, of, how, peppermint, patty, s, single, father, works, late, she, stays, awake, at, night, waiting, for, him, in, general, charles, schulz, imagined, that, some, of, her, problems, were, from, having, an, absent, mother, marcie, is, bookish, and, a, good, student, schulz, described, her, as, relatively, perceptive, compared, to, other, characters, stating, that, she, sees, the, truth, in, things, although, she, perpetually, addresses, peppermint, patty, as, sir, the, writer, laura, bradley, identified, her, role, as, the, unassuming, one, with, sage, like, insights, in, addition, to, the, core, cast, other, characters, appeared, regularly, for, a, majority, of, the, strip, s, duration, several, early, characters, faded, out, of, prominence, during, the, strip, s, run, for, example, shermy, patty, and, violet, were, core, characters, during, the, initial, years, of, the, strip, by, 1956, patty, and, violet, s, roles, were, described, only, as, an, extension, to, lucy, s, and, shermy, who, was, initially, charlie, brown, s, closest, friend, was, then, described, merely, as, an, extra, little, boy, in, 1954, schulz, attempted, to, introduce, charlotte, braun, who, was, essentially, a, female, version, of, charlie, brown, but, with, an, excessively, loud, voice, poor, reaction, to, her, humorless, personality, led, to, schulz, killing, her, off, in, a, tongue, in, cheek, letter, to, a, fan, in, 1955, similarly, frieda, a, girl, with, naturally, curly, hair, was, introduced, in, 1962, but, was, already, being, phased, out, by, the, late, 1960s, after, her, comic, value, had, seemed, to, have, rapidly, run, its, course, and, after, 1975, she, made, only, background, appearances, conversely, rerun, the, youngest, brother, of, linus, and, lucy, had, only, limited, visibility, after, his, introduction, in, 1973, but, became, a, foreground, character, by, the, middle, of, the, 1990s, schulz, received, the, national, cartoonists, society, humor, comic, strip, award, for, peanuts, in, 1962, the, reuben, award, in, 1955, and, 1964, the, first, cartoonist, to, receive, the, honor, twice, the, elzie, segar, award, in, 1980, and, the, milton, caniff, lifetime, achievement, award, in, 1999, a, charlie, brown,

star, on, the, hollywood, walk, of, fame, as, does, snoopy, and, a, place, in, the, william, randolph, hearst, cartoon, hall, of, fame, peanuts, was, featured, on, the, cover, of, time, on, april, 9, 1965, with, the, accompanying, article, calling, it, the, leader, of, a, refreshing, new, breed, that, takes, an, unprecedented, interest, in, the, basics, of, life, the, strip, was, declared, second, in, a, list, of, the, greatest, comics, of, the, 20th, century, commissioned, by, the, comics, journal, in, 1999, the, top, ranked, comic, was, george, herriman, s, krazy, kat, a, strip, schulz, admired, and, in, fact, was, among, his, biggest, inspirations, and, he, accepted, the, ranking, in, good, grace, to, the, point, of, agreeing, with, it, in, 2002, tv, guide, declared, snoopy, and, charlie, brown, tied, for, 8th, in, its, list, of, the, top, 50, greatest, cartoon, characters, of, all, time, published, to, commemorate, its, 50th, anniversary, schulz, was, included, in, the, touring, exhibition, masters, of, american, comics, his, work, was, described, as, psychologically, complex, and, his, style, as, perfectly, in, keeping, with, the, style, of, its, times, despite, the, widespread, acclaim, peanuts, has, received, some, critics, have, alleged, a, decline, in, quality, in, the, later, years, of, its, run, as, schulz, frequently, digressed, from, the, more, cerebral, socio, psychological, themes, that, characterized, his, earlier, work, in, favor, of, lighter, more, whimsical, fare, for, example, in, an, essay, published, in, the, new, york, press, at, the, time, of, the, final, daily, strip, in, january, 2000, against, snoopy, christopher, caldwell, argued, that, snoopy, and, the, strip, s, increased, focus, on, him, in, the, 1970s, went, from, being, the, strip, s, besetting, artistic, weakness, to, ruining, it, altogether, many, cartoonists, who, came, after, schulz, have, cited, his, work, as, an, influence, including, lynn, johnston, patrick, mcdonnell, and, cathy, guisewite, the, latter, of, whom, stated, a, comic, strip, like, mine, would, never, have, existed, if, charles, schulz, hadn, t, paved, the, way, the, december, 1997,

peanuts, just, beneath, the, cheerful, surface, were, vulnerabilities, and, anxieties, that, we, all, experienced, but, were, reluctant, to, acknowledge, by, sharing, those, feelings, with, us, schulz, showed, us, a, vital, aspect, of, our, common, humanity, which, is, it, seems, to, me, the, ultimate, goal, of, great, art, cartoon, tributes, have, appeared, in, other, comic, strips, since, schulz, s, death, in, 2000, and, are, now, displayed, at, the, charles, schulz, museum, on, may, 27, 2000, many, cartoonists, collaborated, to, include, references, to, peanuts, in, their, strips,

the, ford, campaign, as, the, first, time, where, licensing, the, characters, earned, a, lot, of, money, however, he, expressed, a, dislike, of, illustrating, the, adverts, describing, it, as, hard, work, and, would, have, preferred, to, dedicate, equivalent, effort, to, drawing, the, sunday, format, strips, some, licensing, relationships, were, maintained, long, term, hallmark, began, printing, greetings, cards, and, party, goods, featuring, the, characters, in, 1960, in, the, late, 1960s, sanrio, held, the, licensing, rights, in, japan, for, snoopy, sanrio, is, best, known, for, hello,

company, with, the, intention, to, make, the, business, more, friendly, and, approachable, schulz, justified, the, licensing, relationship, with, metlife, as, necessary, to, financially, support, his, philanthropic, work, although, refused, to, openly, describe, the, exact, details, of, the, work, he, was, financing, in, 2016, the, 31, year, licensing, relationship, with, metlife, ended, the, relationship, resumed, in, 2023, with, snoopy, returning, as, a, mascot, for, pet, insurance, in, 1999, it, was, estimated, that, there, were, 20, 000, different, new, products, each, year, adorning, a, variety, of, licensed, items, such, as, clothing, plush, toys, of, snoopy, thermos, bottles, lunch, boxes, picture, frames, and, music, boxes, the, familiarity, of, the, characters, also, proved, lucrative, for, advertising, material, in, both, print, and, television, appearing, on, products, such, as, dolly, madison, snack, cakes, chex, mix, snacks, bounty, paper, towels, kraft, macaroni, cheese, and, a, w, root, beer, the, sheer, extent, to, which, the, characters, are, used, in, licensed, material, is, a, subject, of, criticism, against, schulz, los, angeles, times, pointed, out, that, some, critics, schulz, was, distracted, by, marketing, demands, and, his, characters, had, become, caricatures, of, themselves, by, shilling, for, metropolitan, life, insurance, dolly, madison, cupcakes, and, others, schulz, reasoned, that, his, approach, to, licensing, was, in, fact, modest, stating, our, program, is, built, upon, characters, who, are, figuratively, alive, and, we, re, not,
