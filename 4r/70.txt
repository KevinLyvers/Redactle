all, fields, of, knowledge, in, 2023, the, museum, received, 5, 820, 860, visitors, an, increase, of, 42, from, 2022, it, was, the, most, popular, attraction, in, the, united, kingdom, according, to,

sloane, it, first, opened, to, the, public, in, 1759, in, montagu, house, on, the, site, of, the, current, building, the, museum, s, expansion, over, the, following, 250, years, was, largely, a, result, of, british, colonisation, and, resulted, in, the, creation, of, several, branch, institutions, or, independent, spin, offs, the, first, being, the, natural, history, museum, in, 1881, the, right, to, ownership, of, some, of, its, most, well, known, acquisitions, notably, the, greek, elgin, marbles, and, the, egyptian, rosetta, stone, is, subject, to, long, term, disputes, and, repatriation, claims, in, 1973, the, british, library, act, 1972, detached, the, library, department, from, the, british, museum, but, it, continued, to, host, the, now, separated, british, library,

as, with, all, national, museums, in, the, uk, it, charges, no, admission, fee, except, for, loan, exhibitions, although, today, principally, a, museum, of, cultural, art, objects, and, antiquities, the, british, museum, was, founded, as, a, universal, museum, its, foundations, lie, in, the, will, of, the, anglo, irish, physician, and, naturalist, sir, hans, sloane, 1660, 1753, a, london, based, doctor, and, scientist, from, ulster, during, the, course, of, his, lifetime, and, particularly, after, he, married, the, widow, of, a, wealthy, jamaican, planter, sloane, gathered, a, large, collection, of, curiosities, and, not, wishing, to, see, his, collection, broken, up, after, death, he, bequeathed, it, to, king, george, ii, for, the, nation, for, a, sum, of, 20, 000, at, that, time, sloane, s, collection, consisted, of, around, 71, 000, objects, of, all, kinds, including, some, 40, 000, printed, books, 7, 000, manuscripts, extensive, natural, history, specimens, including, 337, volumes, of, dried, plants, prints, and, drawings, including, those, by, albrecht, d, rer, and, antiquities, from, sudan, egypt, greece, rome, the, ancient, near, and, far, east, and, the,

other, libraries, to, the, sloane, collection, namely, the, cottonian, library, assembled, by, sir, robert, cotton, dating, back, to, elizabethan, times, and, the, harleian, library, the, collection, of, the, earls, of, oxford, they, were, joined, in, 1757, by, the, old, royal, library, now, the, royal, manuscripts, assembled, by, various, british, monarchs, together, these, four, foundation, collections, included, many, of, the, most, treasured, books, now, in, the, british, library, including, the, lindisfarne, gospels, and, the, sole, surviving, manuscript, of, beowulf, the, british, museum, was, the, first, of, a, new, kind, of, museum, national, belonging, to, neither, church, nor, king, freely, open, to, the, public, and, aiming, to, collect, everything, sloane, s, collection, while, including, a, vast, miscellany, of, objects, tended, to, reflect, his, scientific, interests, the, addition, of, the, cotton, and, harley, manuscripts, introduced, a, literary, and, antiquarian, element, and, meant, that, the, british, museum, now, became, both, national, museum, and, library, the, body, of, trustees, decided, on, a, converted, 17th, century, mansion, montagu, house, as, a, location, for, the, museum, which, it, bought, from, the, montagu, family, for, 20, 000, the, trustees, rejected, buckingham, house, which, was, later, converted, into, the, present, day, buckingham, palace, on, the, grounds, of, cost, and, the, unsuitability, of, its, location, with, the, acquisition, of, montagu, house, the, first, exhibition, galleries, and, reading, room, for, scholars, opened, on, 15, january, 1759, at, this, time, the, largest, parts, of, collection, were, the, library, which, took, up, the, majority, of, the, rooms, on, the, ground, floor, of, montagu, house, and, the, natural, history, objects, which, took, up, an, entire, wing, on, the, second, state, storey, of, the, building, in, 1763, the, trustees, of, the, british, museum, under, the, influence, of, peter, collinson, and, william, watson, employed, the, former, student, of, carl, linnaeus, daniel, solander, to, reclassify, the, natural, history, collection, according, to, the, linnaean, system, thereby, making, the, museum, a, public, centre, of, learning, accessible, to, the, full, range, of, european, natural, historians, in, 1823, king, george, iv, gave, the, king, s, library, assembled, by, george, iii, and, parliament, gave, the, right, to, a, copy, of, every, book, published, in, the, country, thereby, ensuring, that, the, museum, s, library, would, expand, indefinitely, during, the, few, years, after, its, foundation, the, british, museum, received, several, further, gifts, including, the, thomason, collection, of, civil, war, tracts, and, david, garrick, s, library, of, 1, 000, printed, plays, the, predominance, of, natural, history, books, and, manuscripts, began, to, lessen, when, in, 1772, the, museum, acquired, for, 8, 410, its, first, significant, antiquities, in, sir, william, hamilton, s, first, collection, of, greek, vases, from, 1778, a, display, of, objects, from, the, south, seas, brought, back, from, the, round, the, world, voyages, of, captain, james, cook, and, the, travels, of, other, explorers, fascinated, visitors, with, a, glimpse, of, previously, unknown, lands, the, bequest, of, a, collection, of, books, engraved, gems, coins, prints, and, drawings, by, clayton, mordaunt, cracherode, in, 1800, did, much, to, raise, the, museum, s, reputation, but, montagu, house, became, increasingly, crowded, and, decrepit, and, it, was, apparent, that, it, would, be, unable, to, cope, with, further, expansion, the, museum, s, first, notable, addition, towards, its, collection, of, antiquities, since, its, foundation, was, by, sir, william, hamilton, 1730, 1803, british, ambassador, to, naples, who, sold, his, collection, of, greek, and, roman, artefacts, to, the, museum, in, 1784, together, with, a, number, of, other, antiquities, and, natural, history, specimens, a, list, of, donations, to, the, museum, dated, 31, january, 1784, refers, to, the, hamilton, bequest, of, a, colossal, foot, of, an, apollo, in, marble, it, was, one, of, two, antiquities, of, hamilton, s, collection, drawn, for, him, by, francesco, progenie, a, pupil, of, pietro, fabris, who, also, contributed, a, number, of, drawings, of, mount, vesuvius, sent, by, hamilton, to, the, royal, society, in, london, in, the, early, 19th, century, the, foundations, for, the, extensive, collection, of, sculpture, began, to, be, laid, and, greek, roman, and, egyptian, artefacts, dominated, the, antiquities, displays, after, the, defeat, of, the, french, campaign, in, the, battle, of, the, nile, in, 1801, the, british, museum, acquired, more, egyptian, sculptures, and, in, 1802, king, george, iii, presented, the, rosetta, stone, key, to, the, deciphering, of, hieroglyphs, gifts, and, purchases, from, henry, salt, british, consul, general, in, egypt, beginning, with, the, colossal, bust, of, ramesses, ii, in, 1818, laid, the, foundations, of, the, collection, of, egyptian, monumental, sculpture, many, greek, sculptures, followed, notably, the, first, purpose, built, exhibition, space, the, charles, towneley, collection, much, of, it, roman, sculpture, in, 1805, in, 1806, thomas, bruce, 7th, earl, of, elgin, ambassador, to, the, ottoman, empire, from, 1799, to, 1803, removed, the, large, collection, of, marble, sculptures, from, the, parthenon, on, the, acropolis, in, athens, and, transferred, them, to, the, uk, in, 1816, these, masterpieces, of, western, art, were, acquired, by, the, british, museum, by, act, of, parliament, and, deposited, in, the, museum, thereafter, the, collections, were, supplemented, by, the, bassae, frieze, from, phigaleia, greece, in, 1815, the, ancient, near, eastern, collection, also, had, its, beginnings, in, 1825, with, the, purchase, of, assyrian, and, babylonian, antiquities, from, the, widow, of, claudius, james, rich, in, 1802, a, buildings, committee, was, set, up, to, plan, for, expansion, of, the, museum, and, further, highlighted, by, the, donation, in, 1822, of, the, king, s, library, personal, library, of, king, george, iii, s, comprising, 65, 000, volumes, 19, 000, pamphlets, maps, charts, and, topographical, drawings, the, neoclassical, architect, sir, robert, smirke, was, asked, to, draw, up, plans, for, an, eastern, extension, to, the, museum, for, the, reception, of, the, royal, library, and, a, picture, gallery, over, it, and, put, forward, plans, for, today, s, quadrangular, building, much, of, which, can, be, seen, today, the, dilapidated, old, montagu, house, was, demolished, and, work, on, the, king, s, library, gallery, began, in, 1823, the, extension, the, east, wing, was, completed, by, 1831, however, following, the, founding, of, the, national, gallery, london, in, 1824, the, proposed, picture, gallery, was, no, longer, needed, and, the, space, on, the, upper, floor, was, given, over, to, the, natural, history, collections, the, first, synopsis, of, the, british, museum, was, published, in, 1808, this, described, the, contents, of, the, museum, and, the, display, of, objects, room, by, room, and, updated, editions, were, published, every, few, years, as, sir, robert, smirke, s, grand, neo, classical, building, gradually, arose, the, museum, became, a, construction, site, the, king, s, library, on, the, ground, floor, of, the, east, wing, was, handed, over, in, 1827, and, was, described, as, one, of, the, finest, rooms, in, london, although, it, was, not, fully, open, to, the, general, public, until, 1857, special, openings, were, arranged, during, the, great, exhibition, of, 1851, in, 1840, the, museum, became, involved, in, its, first, overseas, excavations, charles, fellows, s, expedition, to, xanthos, in, asia, minor, whence, came, remains, of, the, tombs, of, the, rulers, of, ancient, lycia, among, them, the, nereid, and, payava, monuments, in, 1857, charles, newton, was, to, discover, the, 4th, century, bc, mausoleum, of, halikarnassos, one, of, the, seven, wonders, of, the, ancient, world, in, the, 1840s, and, 1850s, the, museum, supported, excavations, in, assyria, by, a, h, layard, and, others, at, sites, such, as, nimrud, and, nineveh, of, particular, interest, to, curators, was, the, eventual, discovery, of, ashurbanipal, s, great, library, of, cuneiform, tablets, which, helped, to, make, the, museum, a, focus, for, assyrian, studies, sir, thomas, grenville, 1755, 1846, a, trustee, of, the, british, museum, from, 1830, assembled, a, library, of, 20, 240, volumes, which, he, left, to, the, museum, in, his, will, the, books, arrived, in, january, 1847, in, twenty, one, horse, drawn, vans, the, only, vacant, space, for, this, large, library, was, a, room, originally, intended, for, manuscripts, between, the, front, entrance, hall, and, the, manuscript, saloon, the, books, remained, here, until, the, british, library, moved, to, st, pancras, in, 1998, the, opening, of, the, forecourt, in, 1852, marked, the, completion, of, robert, smirke, s, 1823, plan, but, already, adjustments, were, having, to, be, made, to, cope, with, the, unforeseen, growth, of, the, collections, infill, galleries, were, constructed, for, assyrian, sculptures, and, sydney, smirke, s, round, reading, room, with, space, for, a, million, books, opened, in, 1857, because, of, continued, pressure, on, space, the, decision, was, taken, to, move, natural, history, to, a, new, building, in, south, kensington, which, would, later, become, the, british, museum, of, natural, history, roughly, contemporary, with, the, construction, of, the, new, building, was, the, career, of, a, man, sometimes, called, the, second, founder, of, the, british, museum, the, italian, librarian, anthony, panizzi, under, his, supervision, the, british, museum, library, now, part, of, the, british, library, quintupled, in, size, and, became, a, well, organised, institution, worthy, of, being, called, a, national, library, the, largest, library, in, the, world, after, the, national, library, of, paris, the, quadrangle, at, the, centre, of, smirke, s, design, proved, to, be, a, waste, of, valuable, space, and, was, filled, at, panizzi, s, request, by, a, circular, reading, room, of, cast, iron, designed, by, smirke, s, brother, sydney, smirke, until, the, mid, 19th, century, the, museum, s, collections, were, relatively, circumscribed, but, in, 1851, with, the, appointment, to, the, staff, of, augustus, wollaston, franks, to, curate, the, collections, the, museum, began, for, the, first, time, to, collect, british, and, european, medieval, antiquities, prehistory, branching, out, into, asia, and, diversifying, its, holdings, of, ethnography, a, real, coup, for, the, museum, was, the, purchase, in, 1867, over, french, objections, of, the, duke, of, blacas, s, wide, ranging, and, valuable, collection, of, antiquities, overseas, excavations, continued, and, john, turtle, wood, discovered, the, remains, of, the, 4th, century, bc, temple, of, artemis, at, ephesos, another, wonder, of, the, ancient, world, the, natural, history, collections, were, an, integral, part, of, the, british, museum, until, their, removal, to, the, new, british, museum, of, natural, history, in, 1887, nowadays, the, natural, history, museum, in, south, kensington, with, the, departure, and, the, completion, of, the, new, white, wing, fronting, montague, street, in, 1884, more, space, was, available, for, antiquities, and, ethnography, and, the, library, could, further, expand, this, was, a, time, of, innovation, as, electric, lighting, was, introduced, in, the, reading, room, and, exhibition, galleries, the, william, burges, collection, of, armoury, was, bequeathed, to, the, museum, in, 1881, in, 1882, the, museum, was, involved, in, the, establishment, of, the, independent, egypt, exploration, fund, now, society, the, first, british, body, to, carry, out, research, in, egypt, a, bequest, from, miss, emma, turner, in, 1892, financed, excavations, in, cyprus, in, 1897, the, death, of, the, great, collector, and, curator, a, w, franks, was, followed, by, an, immense, bequest, of, 3, 300, finger, rings, 153, drinking, vessels, 512, pieces, of, continental, porcelain, 1, 500, netsuke, 850, inro, over, 30, 000, bookplates, and, miscellaneous, items, of, jewellery, and, plate, among, them, the, oxus, treasure, in,

of, objets, d, art, et, de, vertu, which, included, exquisite, examples, of, jewellery, plate, enamel, carvings, glass, and, maiolica, among, them, the, holy, thorn, reliquary, probably, created, in, the, 1390s, in, paris, for, john, duke, of, berry, the, collection, was, in, the, tradition, of, a, schatzkammer, such, as, those, formed, by, the, renaissance, princes, of, europe, baron, ferdinand, s, will, was, most, specific, and, failure, to, observe, the, terms, would, make, it, void, the, collection, should, be, placed, in, a, special, room, to, be, called, the, waddesdon, bequest, room, separate, and, apart, from, the, other, contents, of, the, museum, and, thenceforth, for, ever, thereafter, keep, the, same, in, such, room, or, in, some, other, room, to, be, substituted, for, it, these, terms, are, still, observed, and, the, collection, occupies, room, 2a, by, the, last, years, of, the, 19th, century, the, british, museum, s, collections, had, increased, to, the, extent, that, its, building, was, no, longer, large, enough, in, 1895, the, trustees, purchased, the, 69, houses, surrounding, the, museum, with, the, intention, of, demolishing, them, and, building, around, the, west, north, and, east, sides, of, the, museum, the, first, stage, was, the, construction, of, the, northern, wing, beginning, 1906, all, the, while, the, collections, kept, growing, emil, torday, collected, in, central, africa, aurel, stein, in, central, asia, d, g, hogarth, leonard, woolley, and, t, e, lawrence, excavated, at, carchemish, around, this, time, the, american, collector, and, philanthropist, j, pierpont, morgan, donated, a, substantial, number, of, objects, to, the, museum, including, william, greenwell, s, collection, of, prehistoric, artefacts, from, across, europe, which, he, had, purchased, for, 10, 000, in, 1908, morgan, had, also, acquired, a, major, part, of, sir, john, evans, s, coin, collection, which, was, later, sold, to, the, museum, by, his, son, j, p, morgan, jr, in, 1915, in, 1918, because, of, the, threat, of, wartime, bombing, some, objects, were, evacuated, via, the, london, post, office, railway, to, holborn, the, national, library, of, wales, aberystwyth, and, a, country, house, near, malvern, on, the, return, of, antiquities, from, wartime, storage, in, 1919, some, objects, were, found, to, have, deteriorated, a, conservation, laboratory, was, set, up, in, may, 1920, and, became, a, permanent, department, in, 1931, it, is, today, the, oldest, in, continuous, existence, in, 1923, the, british, museum, welcomed, over, one, million, visitors, new, mezzanine, floors, were, constructed, and, book, stacks, rebuilt, in, an, attempt, to, cope, with, the, flood, of, books, in, 1931, the, art, dealer, sir, joseph, duveen, offered, funds, to, build, a, gallery, for, the, parthenon, sculptures, designed, by, the, american, architect, john, russell, pope, it, was, completed, in, 1938, the, appearance, of, the, exhibition, galleries, began, to, change, as, dark, victorian, reds, gave, way, to, modern, pastel, shades, following, the, retirement, of, george, francis, hill, as, director, and, principal, librarian, in, 1936, he, was, succeeded, by, john, forsdyke, as, tensions, with, nazi, germany, developed, and, it, appeared, that, war, may, be, imminent, forsdyke, came, to, the, view, that, with, the, likelihood, of, far, worse, air, raids, than, that, experienced, in, world, war, i, that, the, museum, had, to, make, preparations, to, remove, its, most, valuable, items, to, secure, locations, following, the, munich, crisis, forsdyke, ordered, 3, 300, no, nail, boxes, and, stored, them, in, the, basement, of, duveen, gallery, at, the, same, time, he, began, identifying, and, securing, suitable, locations, as, a, result, the, museum, was, able, to, quickly, commence, relocating, selected, items, on, 24, august, 1939, a, mere, day, after, the, home, secretary, advised, them, to, do, so, to, secure, basements, country, houses, aldwych, underground, station, and, the, national, library, of, wales, many, items, were, relocated, in, early, 1942, from, their, initial, dispersal, locations, to, a, newly, developed, facility, at, westwood, quarry, in, wiltshire, the, evacuation, was, timely, for, in, 1940, the, duveen, gallery, was, severely, damaged, by, bombing, meanwhile, prior, to, the, war, the, nazis, had, sent, a, researcher, to, the, british, museum, for, several, years, with, the, aim, of, compiling, an, anti, semitic, history, of, anglo, jewry, after, the, war, the, museum, continued, to, collect, from, all, countries, and, all, centuries, among, the, most, spectacular, additions, were, the, 2600, bc, mesopotamian, treasure, from, ur, discovered, during, leonard, woolley, s, 1922, 34, excavations, gold, silver, and, garnet, grave, goods, from, the, anglo, saxon, ship, burial, at, sutton, hoo, 1939, and, late, roman, silver, tableware, from, mildenhall,

began, on, restoring, the, damaged, duveen, gallery, in, 1953, the, museum, celebrated, its, bicentenary, many, changes, followed, the, first, full, time, in, house, designer, and, publications, officer, were, appointed, in, 1964, the, friends, organisation, was, set, up, in, 1968, an, education, service, established, in, 1970, and, publishing, house, in, 1973, in, 1963, a, new, act, of, parliament, introduced, administrative, reforms, it, became, easier, to, lend, objects, the, constitution, of, the, board, of, trustees, changed, and, the, natural, history, museum, became, fully, independent, by, 1959, the, coins, and, medals, office, suite, completely, destroyed, during, the, war, was, rebuilt, and, re, opened, attention, turned, towards, the, gallery, work, with, new, tastes, in, design, leading, to, the, remodelling, of, robert, smirke, s, classical, and, near, eastern, galleries, in, 1962, the, duveen, gallery, was, finally, restored, and, the, parthenon, sculptures, were, moved, back, into, it, once, again, at, the, heart, of, the, museum, by, the, 1970s, the, museum, was, again, expanding, more, services, for, the, public, were, introduced, visitor, numbers, soared, with, the, temporary, exhibition, treasures, of, tutankhamun, in, 1972, attracting, 1, 694, 117, visitors, the, most, successful, in, british, history, in, the, same, year, the, act, of, parliament, establishing, the, british, library, was, passed, separating, the, collection, of, manuscripts, and, printed, books, from, the, british, museum, this, left, the, museum, with, antiquities, coins, medals, and, paper, money, prints, and, drawings, and, ethnography, a, pressing, problem, was, finding, space, for, additions, to, the, library, which, now, required, an, extra, 1, 1, 4, miles, 2, 0, km, of, shelving, each, year, the, government, suggested, a, site, at, st, pancras, for, the, new, british, library, but, the, books, did, not, leave, the, museum, until, 1997, the, departure, of, the, british, library, to, a, new, site, at, st, pancras, finally, achieved, in, 1998, provided, the, space, needed, for, the, books, it, also, created, the, opportunity, to, redevelop, the, vacant, space, in, robert, smirke, s, 19th, century, central, quadrangle, into, the, queen, elizabeth, ii, great, court, the, largest, covered, square, in, europe, which, opened, in, 2000, the, ethnography, collections, which, had, been, housed, in, the, short, lived, museum, of, mankind, at, 6, burlington, gardens, from, 1970, were, returned, to, new, purpose, built, galleries, in, the, museum, in, 2000, the, museum, again, readjusted, its, collecting, policies, as, interest, in, modern, objects, prints, drawings, medals, and, the, decorative, arts, reawakened, ethnographical, fieldwork, was, carried, out, in, places, as, diverse, as, new, guinea, madagascar, romania, guatemala, and, indonesia, and, there, were, excavations, in, the, near, east, egypt, sudan, and, the, uk, the, weston, gallery, of, roman, britain, opened, in, 1997, displayed, a, number, of, recently, discovered, hoards, which, demonstrated, the, richness, of, what, had, been, considered, an, unimportant, part, of, the, roman, empire, the, museum, turned, increasingly, towards, private, funds, for, buildings, acquisitions, and, other, purposes, in, 2000, the, british, museum, was, awarded,

gallery, was, painted, a, deep, terracotta, red, which, though, in, some, ways, satisfactory, diminished, its, apparent, size, and, was, apt, to, produce, a, depressing, effect, on, the, visitor, it, was, decided, to, experiment, with, lighter, colours, and, the, walls, of, the, large, room, were, painted, with, what, was, at, its, first, application, a, pure, cold, white, but, which, after, a, year, s, exposure, had, unfortunately, yellowed, the, small, elgin, room, was, painted, with, pure, white, tinted, with, prussian, blue, and, the, room, of, the, metopes, was, painted, with, pure, white, tinted, with, cobalt, blue, and, black, it, was, necessary, for, practical, reasons, to, colour, all, the, dadoes, a, darker, colour, it, is, i, suppose, not, positively, bad, but, it, could, have, been, infinitely, better, it, is, pretentious, in, that, it, uses, the, ancient, marbles, to, decorate, itself, this, is, a, long, outmoded, idea, and, the, exact, opposite, of, what, a, sculpture, gallery, should, do, and, although, it, incorporates, them, it, is, out, of, scale, and, tends, to, dwarf, them, with, its, bogus, doric, features, including, those, columns, supporting, almost, nothing, which, would, have, made, an, ancient, greek, artist, architect, wince, the, source, of, daylight, is, too, high, above, the, sculptures, a, fault, that, is, only, concealed, by, the, amount, of, reflection, from, the, pinkish, marble, walls, these, are, too, similar, in, colour, to, the, marbles, these, half, dozen, elementary, errors, were, pointed, out, by, everyone, in, the,
