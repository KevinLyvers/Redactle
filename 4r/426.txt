like, a, rolling, stone, is, a, song, by, the, american, singer, songwriter, bob, dylan, released, on, july, 20, 1965, by, columbia, records, its, confrontational, lyrics, originated, in, an, extended, piece, of, verse, dylan, wrote, in, june, 1965, when, he, returned, exhausted, from, a, grueling, tour, of, england, dylan, distilled, this, draft, into, four, verses, and, a, chorus, like, a, rolling, stone, was, recorded, a, few, weeks, later, as, part, of, the, sessions, for, the, forthcoming, album, highway, 61, revisited, during, a, difficult, two, day, preproduction, dylan, struggled, to, find, the, essence, of, the, song, which, was, demoed, without, success, in, 3, 4, time, a, breakthrough, was, made, when, it, was, tried, in, a, rock, music, format, and, rookie, session, musician, al, kooper, improvised, the, hammond, b2, organ, riff, for, which, the, track, is, known, columbia, records, was, unhappy, with, both, the, song, s, length, at, over, six, minutes, and, its, heavy, electric, sound, and, was, hesitant, to, release, it, it, was, only, when, a, month, later, a, copy, was, leaked, to, a, new, popular, music, club, and, heard, by, influential, djs, that, the, song, was, put, out, as, a, single, although, radio, stations, were, reluctant, to, play, such, a, long, track, like, a, rolling, stone, reached, no, 2, in, the, us, billboard, charts, no, 1, in, cashbox, and, became, a, worldwide, hit, critics, have, described, like, a, rolling, stone, as, revolutionary, in, its, combination, of, musical, elements, the, youthful, cynical, sound, of, dylan, s, voice, and, the, directness, of, the, question, how, does, it, feel, it, completed, the, transformation, of, dylan, s, image, from, folk, singer, to, rock, star, and, is, considered, one, of, the, most, influential, compositions, in, postwar, popular, music, rolling, stone, magazine, listed, it, at, no, 1, on, their, 2004, and, 2010, 500, greatest, songs, of, all, time, lists, it, has, been, covered, by, many, artists, from, the, jimi, hendrix, experience, and, the, rolling, stones, to, the, wailers, cat, power, titus, andronicus, and, green, day, at, an, auction, in, 2014, dylan, s, handwritten, lyrics, to, the, song, fetched, 2, million, a, world, record, for, a, popular, music, manuscript, in, early, 1965, after, returning, from, the, tour, of, england, documented, in, the, film, dont, look, back, dylan, was, unhappy, with, the, public, s, expectations, of, him, and, the, direction, his, career, was, taking, and, considered, quitting, the, music, business, he, said, in, a, 1966, playboy, interview, last, spring, i, guess, i, was, going, to, quit, singing, i, was, very, drained, and, the, way, things, were, going, it, was, a, very, draggy, situation, but, like, a, rolling, stone, changed, it, all, i, mean, it, was, something, that, i, myself, could, dig, it, s, very, tiring, having, other, people, tell, you, how, much, they, dig, you, if, you, yourself, don, t, dig, you, the, song, grew, out, of, an, extended, piece, of, verse, in, 1966, dylan, described, its, genesis, to, journalist, jules, siegel, it, was, ten, pages, long, it, wasn, t, called, anything, just, a, rhythm, thing, on, paper, all, about, my, steady, hatred, directed, at, some, point, that, was, honest, in, the, end, it, wasn, t, hatred, it, was, telling, someone, something, they, didn, t, know, telling, them, they, were, lucky, revenge, that, s, a, better, word, i, had, never, thought, of, it, as, a, song, until, one, day, i, was, at, the, piano, and, on, the, paper, it, was, singing, how, does, it, feel, in, a, slow, motion, pace, in, the, utmost, of, slow, motion, following, something, during, 1965, dylan, composed, prose, poems, and, songs, by, typing, incessantly, footage, in, dont, look, back, of, dylan, in, his, suite, at, london, s, savoy, hotel, captures, this, process, however, dylan, told, two, interviewers, that, like, a, rolling, stone, began, as, a, long, piece, of, vomit, 10, pages, long, according, to, one, account, 20, according, to, another, that, later, acquired, musical, form, dylan, has, never, publicly, spoken, of, writing, any, other, major, composition, in, this, way, in, an, interview, with, cbc, radio, in, montreal, dylan, called, the, creation, of, the, song, a, breakthrough, explaining, that, it, changed, his, perception, of, where, he, was, going, in, his, career, he, said, that, he, found, himself, writing, this, long, piece, of, vomit, 20, pages, long, and, out, of, it, i, took, like, a, rolling, stone, and, made, it, as, a, single, and, i, d, never, written, anything, like, that, before, and, it, suddenly, came, to, me, that, was, what, i, should, do, after, writing, that, i, wasn, t, interested, in, writing, a, novel, or, a, play, i, just, had, too, much, i, want, to, write, songs, from, the, extended, version, on, paper, dylan, crafted, four, verses, and, the, chorus, in, woodstock, new, york, in, 2014, when, the, handwritten, lyrics, were, put, up, for, auction, the, four, page, manuscript, revealed, that, the, full, refrain, of, the, chorus, does, not, appear, until, the, fourth, page, a, rejected, third, line, like, a, dog, without, a, bone, gives, way, to, now, you, re, unknown, earlier, dylan, had, considered, working, the, name, al, capone, into, the, rhyme, scheme, and, he, attempted, to, construct, a, rhyme, scheme, for, how, does, it, feel, penciling, in, it, feels, real, does, it, feel, real, shut, up, and, deal, get, down, and, kneel, and, raw, deal, the, song, was, written, on, an, upright, piano, in, the, key, of, d, flat, and, was, changed, to, c, on, the, guitar, in, the, recording, studio, dylan, invited, chicago, blues, guitarist, mike, bloomfield, to, his, woodstock, home, for, the, weekend, to, learn, new, material, bloomfield, recalled, the, first, thing, i, heard, was, like, a, rolling, stone, i, figured, he, wanted, blues, string, bending, because, that, s, what, i, do, he, said, hey, man, i, don, t, want, any, of, that, b, b, king, stuff, so, ok, i, really, fell, apart, what, the, heck, does, he, want, we, messed, around, with, the, song, i, played, the, way, that, he, dug, and, he, said, it, was, groovy, the, recording, sessions, were, produced, by, tom, wilson, on, june, 15, 16, 1965, in, studio, a, of, columbia, records, 799, seventh, avenue, in, new, york, city, this, would, be, the, last, song, wilson, would, produce, for, dylan, in, addition, to, bloomfield, the, musicians, enlisted, were, paul, griffin, on, piano, joe, macho, jr, on, bass, bobby, gregg, on, drums, and, bruce, langhorne, on, tambourine, all, booked, by, wilson, gregg, griffin, and, langhorne, had, previously, worked, with, dylan, and, wilson, on, bringing, it, all, back, home, in, the, first, session, on, june, 15, five, takes, of, the, song, were, recorded, in, a, markedly, different, style, 3, 4, waltz, time, with, dylan, on, piano, from, the, eventual, release, the, lack, of, sheet, music, meant, the, song, had, to, be, played, by, ear, however, its, essence, was, discovered, in, the, course, of, the, chaotic, session, the, musicians, did, not, reach, the, first, chorus, until, the, fourth, take, but, after, the, following, harmonica, fill, dylan, interrupted, saying, my, voice, is, gone, man, you, wanna, try, it, again, the, session, ended, shortly, afterward, the, take, was, released, on, the, 1991, compilation, the, bootleg, series, volumes, 1, 3, rare, unreleased, 1961, 1991, when, the, musicians, reconvened, the, following, day, june, 16, al, kooper, joined, the, proceedings, kooper, at, that, time, a, 21, year, old, session, guitarist, was, not, originally, supposed, to, play, but, was, present, in, the, studio, as, wilson, s, guest, when, wilson, stepped, out, kooper, sat, down, with, his, guitar, with, the, other, musicians, hoping, to, take, part, in, the, recording, session, by, the, time, wilson, returned, kooper, who, had, been, intimidated, by, bloomfield, s, guitar, playing, was, back, in, the, control, room, after, a, couple, of, rehearsal, takes, wilson, moved, griffin, from, hammond, organ, to, piano, kooper, approached, wilson, and, told, him, he, had, a, good, part, for, the, organ, wilson, belittled, kooper, s, organ, skills, but, did, not, forbid, him, to, play, as, kooper, later, put, it, he, just, sort, of, scoffed, at, me, he, didn, t, say, no, so, i, went, out, there, wilson, was, surprised, to, see, kooper, at, the, organ, but, allowed, him, to, play, on, the, track, when, dylan, heard, a, playback, of, the, song, he, insisted, that, the, organ, be, turned, up, in, the, mix, despite, wilson, s, protestations, that, kooper, was, not, an, organ, player, there, were, 15, recorded, takes, on, june, 16, by, now, the, song, had, evolved, into, its, familiar, form, in, 4, 4, time, with, dylan, on, electric, guitar, after, the, fourth, take, the, master, take, that, was, released, as, a, single, wilson, happily, commented, that, sounds, good, to, me, despite, this, dylan, and, the, band, recorded, the, song, 11, more, times, the, complete, recording, sessions, that, produced, like, a, rolling, stone, including, all, 20, takes, and, the, individual, stems, that, comprise, the, four, track, master, were, released, in, november, 2015, on, the, 6, disc, and, 18, disc, versions, of, the, bootleg, series, vol, 12, the, cutting, edge, 1965, 1966, unlike, conventional, chart, hits, of, the, time, like, a, rolling, stone, featured, lyrics, that, were, interpreted, as, expressions, of, resentment, rather, than, love, author, oliver, trager, characterizes, the, lyrics, as, dylan, s, sneer, at, a, woman, who, has, fallen, from, grace, and, is, reduced, to, fending, for, herself, in, a, hostile, unfamiliar, world, the, song, s, subject, miss, lonely, previously, opted, for, easy, options, in, life, she, attended, the, finest, schools, and, enjoyed, high, placed, friends, but, now, that, her, situation, has, become, difficult, it, appears, that, she, has, no, meaningful, experiences, to, define, her, character, the, opening, lines, of, the, song, establish, the, character, s, former, condition, once, upon, a, time, you, dressed, so, fine, threw, the, bums, a, dime, in, your, prime, didn, t, you, and, the, first, verse, ends, with, lines, that, seemingly, deride, her, current, condition, now, you, don, t, talk, so, loud, now, you, don, t, seem, so, proud, about, having, to, be, scrounging, your, next, meal, despite, the, obvious, vitriol, the, song, s, narrator, also, seems, to, show, compassion, for, miss, lonely, and, expresses, joy, for, her, in, the, freedom, in, losing, everything, jann, wenner, commented, everything, has, been, stripped, away, you, re, on, your, own, you, re, free, now, you, re, so, helpless, and, now, you, ve, got, nothing, left, and, you, re, invisible, you, ve, got, no, secrets, that, s, so, liberating, you, ve, nothing, to, fear, anymore, the, final, verse, ends, with, the, lines, when, you, ain, t, got, nothing, you, got, nothing, to, lose, you, re, invisible, now, you, got, no, secrets, to, conceal, the, refrain, seems, to, emphasize, these, themes, how, does, it, feel, how, does, it, feel, to, be, on, your, own, with, no, direction, home, like, a, complete, unknown, like, a, rolling, stone, dylan, biographer, robert, shelton, gave, this, interpretation, a, song, that, seems, to, hail, the, dropout, life, for, those, who, can, take, it, segues, into, compassion, for, those, who, have, dropped, out, of, bourgeois, surroundings, rolling, stone, is, about, the, loss, of, innocence, and, the, harshness, of, experience, myths, props, and, old, beliefs, fall, away, to, reveal, a, very, taxing, reality, dylan, humorously, commented, on, the, song, s, moral, perspective, at, a, press, conference, at, kqed, television, studio, on, december, 3, 1965, when, a, reporter, suggesting, that, the, song, adopted, a, harsh, perspective, on, a, girl, asked, dylan, are, you, hard, on, because, you, want, to, torment, them, or, to, change, their, lives, and, make, them, know, themselves, dylan, replied, while, laughing, i, want, to, needle, them, commentators, attempted, to, tie, the, characters, in, the, song, to, specific, people, in, dylan, s, personal, life, in, 1965, in, his, book, popism, the, warhol, 60s, andy, warhol, recalled, that, some, people, in, his, circle, believed, that, like, a, rolling, stone, contained, hostile, references, to, him, he, was, told, listen, to, like, a, rolling, stone, i, think, you, re, the, diplomat, on, the, chrome, horse, man, the, reason, behind, dylan, s, alleged, hostility, to, warhol, was, supposedly, warhol, s, treatment, of, actress, and, model, edie, sedgwick, it, has, been, suggested, that, sedgwick, is, the, basis, of, the, miss, lonely, character, sedgwick, was, briefly, involved, with, dylan, in, late, 1965, and, early, 1966, around, which, time, there, was, some, discussion, of, the, two, making, a, movie, together, according, to, warhol, s, collaborator, paul, morrissey, sedgwick, may, have, been, in, love, with, dylan, and, was, shocked, when, she, found, out, that, dylan, had, secretly, married, sara, lownds, in, november, 1965, however, in, the, bob, dylan, encyclopedia, michael, gray, argues, that, sedgwick, had, no, connection, with, like, a, rolling, stone, but, states, there, s, no, doubt, that, the, ghost, of, edie, sedgwick, hangs, around, blonde, on, blonde, greil, marcus, alluded, to, a, suggestion, by, art, historian, thomas, e, crow, that, dylan, had, written, the, song, as, a, comment, on, warhol, s, scene, i, heard, a, lecture, by, thomas, crow, about, like, a, rolling, stone, being, about, edie, sedgwick, within, andy, warhol, s, circle, as, something, that, dylan, saw, from, the, outside, not, being, personally, involved, with, either, of, them, but, as, something, he, saw, and, was, scared, by, and, saw, disaster, looming, and, wrote, a, song, as, a, warning, and, it, was, compelling, joan, baez, marianne, faithfull, and, bob, neuwirth, have, also, been, suggested, as, possible, targets, of, dylan, s, scorn, dylan, s, biographer, howard, sounes, warned, against, reducing, the, song, to, the, biography, of, one, person, and, suggested, it, is, more, likely, that, the, song, was, aimed, generally, at, those, perceived, as, being, phony, sounes, adds, there, is, some, irony, in, the, fact, that, one, of, the, most, famous, songs, of, the, folk, rock, era, an, era, associated, primarily, with, ideals, of, peace, and, harmony, is, one, of, vengeance, mike, marqusee, has, written, at, length, on, the, conflicts, in, dylan, s, life, during, this, time, with, its, deepening, alienation, from, his, old, folk, revival, audience, and, clear, cut, leftist, causes, he, suggests, that, the, song, is, probably, self, referential, the, song, only, attains, full, poignancy, when, one, realises, it, is, sung, at, least, in, part, to, the, singer, himself, he, s, the, one, with, no, direction, home, dylan, himself, has, noted, that, after, his, motorcycle, accident, in, 1966, he, realized, that, when, i, used, words, like, he, and, it, and, they, and, talking, about, other, people, i, was, really, talking, about, nobody, but, me, the, song, is, also, notable, for, the, amazing, characters, that, surround, the, heroine, andy, gill, recalls, the, strangeness, contained, in, the, lyrics, who, fascinated, fans, debated, was, miss, lonely, napoleon, in, rags, and, most, bizarre, of, all, the, diplomat, who, rode, a, chrome, horse, while, balancing, a, siamese, cat, upon, his, shoulder, what, on, earth, was, going, on, here, the, diplomat, in, question, in, the, third, verse, you, used, to, ride, on, the, chrome, horse, with, your, diplomat, who, carried, on, his, shoulder, a, siamese, cat, ain, t, it, hard, when, you, discover, that, he, really, wasn, t, where, it, s, at, after, he, took, from, you, everything, he, could, steal, one, interpretation, was, formulated, in, jean, michel, buizard, s, 2021, essay, like, a, rolling, stone, revisited, une, relecture, de, dylan, which, sheds, new, light, on, the, possible, identity, of, miss, lonely, and, company, the, central, idea, is, that, in, 1965, the, young, dylan, remained, secretly, haunted, by, the, country, blues, which, formed, the, framework, of, his, first, album, bob, dylan, 1962, and, of, which, he, would, say, in, 2004, in, his, chronicles, it, was, a, counterpart, of, myself, the, song, is, then, conceived, as, a, half, historical, half, imaginary, tale, in, which, the, old, blues, once, sovereign, in, the, southern, countryside, surrounded, by, its, servants, the, bluesmen, finds, itself, alone, and, abandoned, in, the, 1940s, when, these, same, bluesmen, following, the, great, wave, of, migration, of, the, black, population, left, for, the, cities, of, the, north, and, founded, there, a, modern, blues, electrified, and, emptied, of, its, roots, miss, lonely, is, thus, an, allegory, of, country, blues, muddy, waters, author, in, 1950, of, a, well, known, blues, entitled, rollin, stone, is, emblematic, of, this, great, history, of, the, blues, he, is, the, one, we, find, as, a, diplomat, shouldering, his, guitar, the, siamese, cat, on, the, train, the, chrome, horse, that, took, him, to, chicago, in, 1943, where, he, transformed, the, blues, of, his, childhood, into, the, city, blues, that, made, him, famous, he, took, from, you, everything, he, could, steal, other, legendary, bluesmen, appear, in, the, song, presumably, blind, lemon, jefferson, as, the, mystery, tramp, in, the, second, verse, and, robert, johnson, napoleon, in, rags, in, the, final, one, according, to, shaun, considine, release, coordinator, for, columbia, records, in, 1965, like, a, rolling, stone, was, first, relegated, to, the, graveyard, of, canceled, releases, because, of, concerns, from, the, sales, and, marketing, departments, over, its, unprecedented, six, minute, length, and, raucous, rock, sound, in, the, days, following, the, rejection, considine, took, a, discarded, acetate, of, the, song, to, the, new, york, club, arthur, a, newly, opened, disco, popular, with, celebrities, and, the, media, and, asked, a, dj, to, play, it, at, the, crowd, s, insistence, the, demo, was, played, repeatedly, until, finally, it, wore, out, the, next, morning, a, disc, jockey, and, a, programming, director, from, the, city, s, leading, top, 40, stations, called, columbia, and, demanded, copies, shortly, afterward, on, july, 20, 1965, like, a, rolling, stone, was, released, as, a, single, with, gates, of, eden, as, its, b, side, despite, its, length, the, song, is, dylan, s, most, commercially, successful, release, remaining, in, the, us, charts, for, 12, weeks, where, it, reached, number, 2, the, song, that, held, it, from, the, top, spot, was, the, beatles, help, the, promotional, copies, released, to, disc, jockeys, on, july, 15, had, the, first, two, verses, and, two, refrains, on, one, side, of, the, disk, and, the, remainder, of, the, song, on, the, other, djs, wishing, to, play, the, entire, song, would, simply, flip, the, vinyl, over, while, many, radio, stations, were, reluctant, to, play, like, a, rolling, stone, in, its, entirety, public, demand, eventually, forced, them, to, air, it, in, full, this, helped, the, single, reach, its, number, 2, peak, several, weeks, after, its, release, it, was, a, top,

they, started, to, play, the, track, an, audience, member, yelled, judas, apparently, referring, to, dylan, s, supposed, betrayal, of, folk, music, dylan, responded, i, don, t, believe, you, you, re, a, liar, with, that, he, turned, to, the, band, ordering, them, to, play, it, fucking, loud, since, then, like, a, rolling, stone, has, remained, a, staple, in, dylan, s, concerts, often, with,

dylan, a, pop, icon, as, paul, williams, notes, dylan, had, been, famous, had, been, the, center, of, attention, for, a, long, time, but, now, the, ante, was, being, upped, again, he, d, become, a, pop, star, as, well, as, a, folk, star, and, was, even, more, than, the, beatles, a, public, symbol, of, the, vast, cultural, political, generational, changes, taking, place, in, the, united, states, and, europe, he, was, perceived, as, and, in, many, ways, functioned, as, a, leader, paul, rothchild, producer, of, the, doors, first, five, albums, recalled, the, elation, that, an, american, musician, had, made, a, record, that, successfully, challenged, the, primacy, of, the, british, invasion, groups, he, said, what, i, realized, when, i, was, sitting, there, is, that, one, of, us, one, of, the, so, called, village, hipsters, was, making, music, that, could, compete, with, them, the, beatles, and, the, stones, and, the, dave, clark, five, without, sacrificing, any, of, the, integrity, of, folk, music, or, the, power, of, rock, n, roll, the, song, had, a, huge, impact, on, bruce, springsteen, who, was, 15, years, old, when, he, first, heard, it, springsteen, described, the, moment, during, his, speech, inducting, dylan, into, the, rock, and, roll, hall, of, fame, in, 1988, and, also, assessed, the, long, term, significance, of, like, a, rolling, stone, the, first, time, i, heard, bob, dylan, i, was, in, the, car, with, my, mother, listening, to, wmca, and, on, came, that, snare, shot, that, sounded, like, somebody, d, kicked, open, the, door, to, your, mind, the, way, that, elvis, freed, your, body, dylan, freed, your, mind, and, showed, us, that, because, the, music, was, physical, did, not, mean, it, was, anti, intellect, he, had, the, vision, and, talent, to, make, a, pop, song, so, that, it, contained, the, whole, world, he, invented, a, new, way, a, pop, singer, could, sound, broke, through, the, limitations, of, what, a, recording, could, achieve, and, he, changed, the, face, of, rock, n, roll, for, ever, and, ever, dylan, s, contemporaries, in, 1965, were, both, startled, and, challenged, by, the, single, paul, mccartney, remembered, going, around, to, john, lennon, s, house, in, weybridge, to, hear, the, song, according, to, mccartney, it, seemed, to, go, on, and, on, forever, it, was, just, beautiful, he, showed, all, of, us, that, it, was, possible, to, go, a, little, further, frank, zappa, had, a, more, extreme, reaction, when, i, heard, like, a, rolling, stone, i, wanted, to, quit, the, music, business, because, i, felt, if, this, wins, and, it, does, what, it, s, supposed, to, do, i, don, t, need, to, do, anything, else, but, it, didn, t, do, anything, it, sold, but, nobody, responded, to, it, in, the, way, that, they, should, have, nearly, forty, years, later, in, 2003, elvis, costello, commented, on, the, innovative, quality, of, the, single, what, a, shocking, thing, to, live, in, a, world, where, there, was, manfred, mann, and, the, supremes, and, engelbert, humperdinck, and, here, comes, like, a, rolling, stone, although, cbs, tried, to, make, the, record, more, radio, friendly, by, cutting, it, in, half, and, spreading, it, over, both, sides, of, the, vinyl, both, dylan, and, fans, demanded, that, the, full, duration, of, the, recording, should, be, placed, on, one, side, and, that, radio, stations, play, the, song, in, its, entirety, the, success, of, like, a, rolling, stone, was, influential, in, changing, the, music, business, convention, regarding, the, length, of, singles, whereby, they, were, restricted, to, durations, of, less, than, three, minutes, in, the, words, of, the, magazine, rolling, stone, which, took, its, name, from, the, song, and, the, 1950s, blues, song, rollin, stone, no, other, pop, song, has, so, thoroughly, challenged, and, transformed, the, commercial, laws, and, artistic, conventions, of, its, time, for, all, time, richard, austin, of, sotheby, s, auction, house, said, before, the, release, of, like, a, rolling, stone, music, charts, were, overrun, with, short, and, sweet, love, songs, many, clocking, in, at, three, minutes, or, less, by, defying, convention, with, six, and, a, half, minutes, of, dark, brooding, poetry, dylan, rewrote, the, rules, for, pop, music, in, 1966, dylan, told, ralph, gleason, rolling, stone, s, the, best, song, i, wrote, in, 2004, speaking, to, robert, hilburn, dylan, still, felt, that, the, song, had, a, special, place, in, his, work, it, s, like, a, ghost, is, writing, a, song, like, that, it, gives, you, the, song, and, it, goes, away, you, don, t, know, what, it, means, except, that, the, ghost, picked, me, to, write, the, song, more, than, 50, years, since, its, release, like, a, rolling, stone, remains, highly, regarded, among, commentators, james, gerard, writing, for, allmusic, characterized, the, song, as, one, of, the, most, self, righteous, and, eloquent, indictments, ever, committed, to, wax, and, declared, it, significant, for, beginning, a, new, phase, in, dylan, s, career, as, a, songwriter, and, performer, in, an, analysis, of, dylan, s, vocal, performance, in, like, a, rolling, stone, published, in, far, out, sam, kemp, highlighted, the, ironic, quality, his, delivery, lent, the, song, while, also, praising, the, ambiguity, of, the, lyrics, like, a,

mojo, both, rated, it, as, dylan, s, number, one, song, as, for, his, personal, views, on, such, polls, dylan, told, ed, bradley, in, a, 2004, interview, on, 60, minutes, that, he, never, pays, attention, to, them, because, they, change, frequently, dylan, s, point, was, illustrated, in, the, 100, greatest, songs, of, all, time, poll, by, mojo, in, 2000, which, included, two, dylan, singles,
