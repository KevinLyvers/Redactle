the, violin, sometimes, referred, as, a, fiddle, is, a, wooden, chordophone, and, is, the, smallest, and, thus, highest, pitched, instrument, soprano, in, regular, use, in, the, violin, family, smaller, violin, type, instruments, exist, including, the, violino, piccolo, and, the, pochette, but, these, are, virtually, unused, most, violins, have, a, hollow, wooden, body, and, commonly, have, four, strings, sometimes, five, usually, tuned, in, perfect, fifths, with, notes, g3, d4, a4, e5, and, are, most, commonly, played, by, drawing, a, bow, across, the, strings, the, violin, can, also, be, played, by, plucking, the, strings, with, the, fingers, pizzicato, and, in, specialized, cases, by, striking, the, strings, with, the, wooden, side, of, the, bow, col, legno, violins, are, important, instruments, in, a, wide, variety, of, musical, genres, they, are, most, prominent, in, the, western, classical, tradition, both, in, ensembles, from, chamber, music, to, orchestras, and, as, solo, instruments, violins, are, also, important, in, many, varieties, of, folk, music, including, country, music, bluegrass, music, and, in, jazz, electric, violins, with, solid, bodies, and, piezoelectric, pickups, are, used, in, some, forms, of, rock, music, and, jazz, fusion, with, the, pickups, plugged, into, instrument, amplifiers, and, speakers, to, produce, sound, the, violin, has, come, to, be, incorporated, in, many, non, western, music, cultures, including, indian, music, and, iranian, music, the, name, fiddle, is, often, used, regardless, of, the, type, of, music, played, on, it, the, violin, was, first, known, in, 16th, century, italy, with, some, further, modifications, occurring, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, to, give, the, instrument, a, more, powerful, sound, and, projection, in, europe, it, served, as, the, basis, for, the, development, of, other, stringed, instruments, used, in, western, classical, music, such, as, the, viola, violinists, and, collectors, particularly, prize, the, fine, historical, instruments, made, by, the, stradivari, guarneri, guadagnini, and, amati, families, from, the, 16th, to, the, 18th, century, in, brescia, and, cremona, italy, and, by, jacob, stainer, in, austria, according, to, their, reputation, the, quality, of, their, sound, has, defied, attempts, to, explain, or, equal, it, though, this, belief, is, disputed, great, numbers, of, instruments, have, come, from, the, hands, of, less, famous, makers, as, well, as, still, greater, numbers, of, mass, produced, commercial, trade, violins, coming, from, cottage, industries, in, places, such, as, saxony, bohemia, and, mirecourt, many, of, these, trade, instruments, were, formerly, sold, by, sears, roebuck, and, co, and, other, mass, merchandisers, the, components, of, a, violin, are, usually, made, from, different, types, of, wood, violins, can, be, strung, with, gut, perlon, or, other, synthetic, or, steel, strings, a, person, who, makes, or, repairs, violins, is, called, a, luthier, or, violinmaker, one, who, makes, or, repairs, bows, is, called, an, archetier, or, bowmaker, the, word, violin, was, first, used, in, english, in, the, 1570s, the, word, violin, comes, from, italian, violino, diminutive, of, viola, the, term, viola, comes, from, the, expression, for, tenor, violin, in, 1797, from, italian, and, old, proven, al, viola, medieval, latin, vitula, as, a, term, which, means, stringed, instrument, perhaps, from, vitula, roman, goddess, of, joy, or, from, related, latin, verb, vitulari, to, cry, out, in, joy, or, exaltation, the, related, term, viola, da, gamba, meaning, bass, viol, 1724, is, from, italian, literally, a, viola, for, the, leg, i, e, to, hold, between, the, legs, a, violin, is, the, modern, form, of, the, smaller, medieval, viola, da, braccio, arm, viola, the, violin, is, often, called, a, fiddle, fiddle, can, be, used, as, the, instrument, s, customary, name, in, folk, music, or, as, an, informal, name, for, the, instrument, in, other, styles, of, music, the, word, fiddle, was, first, used, in, english, in, the, late, 14th, century, the, word, fiddle, comes, from, fedele, fydyll, fidel, earlier, fithele, from, old, english, fi, ele, fiddle, which, is, related, to, old, norse, fi, la, middle, dutch, vedele, dutch, vedel, old, high, german, fidula, german, fiedel, a, fiddle, all, of, uncertain, origin, as, to, the, origin, of, the, word, fiddle, the, usual, suggestion, based, on, resemblance, in, sound, and, sense, is, that, it, is, from, medieval, latin, vitula, the, earliest, stringed, instruments, were, mostly, plucked, for, example, the, greek, lyre, two, stringed, bowed, instruments, played, upright, and, strung, and, bowed, with, horsehair, may, have, originated, in, the, nomadic, equestrian, cultures, of, central, asia, in, forms, closely, resembling, the, modern, day, mongolian, morin, huur, and, the, kazakh, kobyz, similar, and, variant, types, were, probably, disseminated, along, east, west, trading, routes, from, asia, into, the, middle, east, and, the, byzantine, empire, according, to, encyclop, dia, britannica, the, direct, ancestor, of, all, european, bowed, instruments, is, the, arabic, rebab, which, developed, into, the, byzantine, lyra, developed, by, the, 9th, century, and, later, the, european, rebec, several, sources, suggest, alternative, possibilities, for, the, violin, s, origins, such, as, northern, or, western, europe, the, first, makers, of, violins, probably, borrowed, from, various, developments, of, the, byzantine, lyra, these, included, the, vielle, also, known, as, the, fidel, or, viuola, and, the, lira, da, braccio, the, violin, in, its, present, form, emerged, in, early, 16th, century, northern, italy, the, earliest, pictures, of, violins, albeit, with, three, strings, are, seen, in, northern, italy, around, 1530, at, around, the, same, time, as, the, words, violino, and, vyollon, are, seen, in, italian, and, french, documents, one, of, the, earliest, explicit, descriptions, of, the, instrument, including, its, tuning, is, from, the, epitome, musical, by, jambe, de, fer, published, in, lyon, in, 1556, by, this, time, the, violin, had, already, begun, to, spread, throughout, europe, the, violin, proved, very, popular, both, among, street, musicians, and, the, nobility, the, french, king, charles, ix, ordered, andrea, amati, to, construct, 24, violins, for, him, in, 1560, one, of, these, noble, instruments, the, charles, ix, is, the, oldest, surviving, violin, the, finest, renaissance, carved, and, decorated, violin, in, the, world, is, the, gasparo, da, sal, c, 1574, owned, by, ferdinand, ii, archduke, of, austria, and, later, from, 1841, by, the, norwegian, virtuoso, ole, bull, who, used, it, for, forty, years, and, thousands, of, concerts, for, its, very, powerful, and, beautiful, tone, similar, to, that, of, a, guarneri, the, messiah, or, le, messie, also, known, as, the, salabue, made, by, antonio, stradivari, in, 1716, remains, pristine, it, is, now, located, in, the, ashmolean, museum, of, oxford, the, most, famous, violin, makers, luthiers, between, the, 16th, century, and, the, 18th, century, include, significant, changes, occurred, in, the, construction, of, the, violin, in, the, 18th, century, particularly, a, longer, neck, which, is, angled, more, toward, the, back, of, the, instrument, than, in, earlier, examples, heavier, strings, and, a, heavier, bass, bar, the, majority, of, old, instruments, have, undergone, these, modifications, and, hence, are, in, a, significantly, different, state, than, when, they, left, the, hands, of, their, makers, doubtless, with, differences, in, sound, and, response, but, it, is, in, their, present, modified, condition, that, these, instruments, have, set, the, standard, for, perfection, in, violin, craftsmanship, and, sound, and, violin, makers, all, over, the, world, try, to, come, as, close, to, this, ideal, as, possible, to, this, day, instruments, from, the, so, called, golden, age, of, violin, making, especially, those, made, by, stradivari, guarneri, del, ges, and, montagnana, are, the, most, sought, after, instruments, by, both, collectors, and, performers, the, current, record, amount, paid, for, a, stradivari, violin, is, 9, 8, million, us, 15, 9, million, at, that, time, when, the, instrument, known, as, the, lady, blunt, was, sold, by, tarisio, auctions, in, an, online, auction, on, june, 20, 2011, a, violin, generally, consists, of, a, spruce, top, the, soundboard, also, known, as, the, top, plate, table, or, belly, maple, ribs, and, back, two, endblocks, a, neck, a, bridge, a, soundpost, four, strings, and, various, fittings, optionally, including, a, chinrest, which, may, attach, directly, over, or, to, the, left, of, the, tailpiece, a, distinctive, feature, of, a, violin, body, is, its, hourglass, like, shape, and, the, arching, of, its, top, and, back, the, hourglass, shape, comprises, two, upper, bouts, two, lower, bouts, and, two, concave, c, bouts, at, the, waist, providing, clearance, for, the, bow, the, voice, or, sound, of, a, violin, depends, on, its, shape, the, wood, it, is, made, from, the, graduation, the, thickness, profile, of, both, the, top, and, back, the, varnish, that, coats, its, outside, surface, and, the, skill, of, the, luthier, in, doing, all, of, these, steps, the, varnish, and, especially, the, wood, continue, to, improve, with, age, making, the, fixed, supply, of, old, well, made, violins, built, by, famous, luthiers, much, sought, after, the, majority, of, glued, joints, in, the, instrument, use, animal, hide, glue, rather, than, common, white, glue, for, a, number, of, reasons, hide, glue, is, capable, of, making, a, thinner, joint, than, most, other, glues, it, is, reversible, brittle, enough, to, crack, with, carefully, applied, force, and, removable, with, hot, water, when, disassembly, is, needed, since, fresh, hide, glue, sticks, to, old, hide, glue, more, original, wood, can, be, preserved, when, repairing, a, joint, more, modern, glues, must, be, cleaned, off, entirely, for, the, new, joint, to, be, sound, which, generally, involves, scraping, off, some, wood, along, with, the, old, glue, weaker, diluted, glue, is, usually, used, to, fasten, the, top, to, the, ribs, and, the, nut, to, the, fingerboard, since, common, repairs, involve, removing, these, parts, the, purfling, running, around, the, edge, of, the, spruce, top, provides, some, protection, against, cracks, originating, at, the, edge, it, also, allows, the, top, to, flex, more, independently, of, the, rib, structure, painted, on, faux, purfling, on, the, top, is, usually, a, sign, of, an, inferior, instrument, the, back, and, ribs, are, typically, made, of, maple, most, often, with, a, matching, striped, figure, referred, to, as, flame, fiddleback, or, tiger, stripe, the, neck, is, usually, maple, with, a, flamed, figure, compatible, with, that, of, the, ribs, and, back, it, carries, the, fingerboard, typically, made, of, ebony, but, often, some, other, wood, stained, or, painted, black, on, cheaper, instruments, ebony, is, the, preferred, material, because, of, its, hardness, beauty, and, superior, resistance, to, wear, fingerboards, are, dressed, to, a, particular, transverse, curve, and, have, a, small, lengthwise, scoop, or, concavity, slightly, more, pronounced, on, the, lower, strings, especially, when, meant, for, gut, or, synthetic, strings, some, old, violins, and, some, made, to, appear, old, have, a, grafted, scroll, evidenced, by, a, glue, joint, between, the, pegbox, and, neck, many, authentic, old, instruments, have, had, their, necks, reset, to, a, slightly, increased, angle, and, lengthened, by, about, a, centimeter, the, neck, graft, allows, the, original, scroll, to, be, kept, with, a, baroque, violin, when, bringing, its, neck, into, conformance, with, modern, standards, the, bridge, is, a, precisely, cut, piece, of, maple, that, forms, the, lower, anchor, point, of, the, vibrating, length, of, the, strings, and, transmits, the, vibration, of, the, strings, to, the, body, of, the, instrument, its, top, curve, holds, the, strings, at, the, proper, height, from, the, fingerboard, in, an, arc, allowing, each, to, be, sounded, separately, by, the, bow, the, sound, post, or, soul, post, fits, precisely, inside, the, instrument, between, the, back, and, top, at, a, carefully, chosen, spot, near, the, treble, foot, of, the, bridge, which, it, helps, support, it, also, influences, the, modes, of, vibration, of, the, top, and, the, back, of, the, instrument, the, tailpiece, anchors, the, strings, to, the, lower, bout, of, the, violin, by, means, of, the, tailgut, which, loops, around, an, ebony, button, called, the, tailpin, sometimes, confusingly, called, the, endpin, like, the, cello, s, spike, which, fits, into, a, tapered, hole, in, the, bottom, block, the, e, string, will, often, have, a, fine, tuning, lever, worked, by, a, small, screw, turned, by, the, fingers, fine, tuners, may, also, be, applied, to, the, other, strings, especially, on, a, student, instrument, and, are, sometimes, built, into, the, tailpiece, the, fine, tuners, enable, the, performer, to, make, small, changes, in, the, pitch, of, a, string, at, the, scroll, end, the, strings, wind, around, the, wooden, tuning, pegs, in, the, pegbox, the, tuning, pegs, are, tapered, and, fit, into, holes, in, the, peg, box, the, tuning, pegs, are, held, in, place, by, the, friction, of, wood, on, wood, strings, may, be, made, of, metal, or, less, commonly, gut, or, gut, wrapped, in, metal, strings, usually, have, a, colored, silk, wrapping, at, both, ends, for, identification, of, the, string, e, g, g, string, d, string, a, string, or, e, string, and, to, provide, friction, against, the, pegs, the, tapered, pegs, allow, friction, to, be, increased, or, decreased, by, the, player, applying, appropriate, pressure, along, the, axis, of, the, peg, while, turning, it, strings, were, first, made, of, sheep, gut, commonly, known, as, catgut, which, despite, the, name, did, not, come, from, cats, or, simply, gut, which, was, stretched, dried, and, twisted, in, the, early, years, of, the, 20th, century, strings, were, made, of, either, gut, or, steel, modern, strings, may, be, gut, solid, steel, stranded, steel, or, various, synthetic, materials, such, as, perlon, wound, with, various, metals, and, sometimes, plated, with, silver, most, e, strings, are, unwound, either, plain, or, plated, steel, gut, strings, are, not, as, common, as, they, once, were, but, many, performers, use, them, to, achieve, a, specific, sound, especially, in, historically, informed, performance, of, baroque, music, strings, have, a, limited, lifetime, eventually, when, oil, dirt, corrosion, and, rosin, accumulate, the, mass, of, the, string, can, become, uneven, along, its, length, apart, from, obvious, things, such, as, the, winding, of, a, string, coming, undone, from, wear, players, generally, change, a, string, when, it, no, longer, plays, true, with, good, intonation, on, the, harmonics, losing, the, desired, tone, brilliance, and, intonation, string, longevity, depends, on, string, quality, and, playing, intensity, a, violin, is, tuned, in, fifths, in, the, notes, g, 3, d, 4, a, 4, e, 5, the, lowest, note, of, a, violin, tuned, normally, is, g, 3, or, g, below, middle, c, c4, on, rare, occasions, the, lowest, string, may, be, tuned, down, by, as, much, as, a, fourth, to, d, 3, the, highest, note, playable, is, less, well, defined, e, 7, the, e, two, octaves, above, the, open, string, which, is, tuned, to, e, 5, may, be, considered, a, practical, limit, for, orchestral, violin, parts, but, it, is, often, possible, to, play, higher, depending, on, the, length, of, the, fingerboard, and, the, skill, of, the, violinist, yet, higher, notes, up, to, c, 8, can, be, sounded, by, stopping, the, string, reaching, the, limit, of, the, fingerboard, and, or, by, using, artificial, harmonics, the, arched, shape, the, thickness, of, the, wood, and, its, physical, qualities, govern, the, sound, of, a, violin, patterns, of, the, node, made, by, sand, or, glitter, sprinkled, on, the, plates, with, the, plate, vibrated, at, certain, frequencies, called, chladni, patterns, are, occasionally, used, by, luthiers, to, verify, their, work, before, assembling, the, instrument, apart, from, the, standard, full, 4, 4, size, violins, are, also, made, in, so, called, fractional, sizes, of, 7, 8, 3, 4, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 8, 1, 10, 1, 16, 1, 32, and, even, 1, 64, these, smaller, instruments, are, commonly, used, by, young, players, whose, fingers, are, not, long, enough, to, reach, the, correct, positions, on, full, sized, instruments, while, related, in, some, sense, to, the, dimensions, of, the, instruments, the, fractional, sizes, are, not, intended, to, be, literal, descriptions, of, relative, proportions, for, example, a, 3, 4, sized, instrument, is, not, three, quarters, the, length, of, a, full, size, instrument, the, body, length, not, including, the, neck, of, a, full, size, or, 4, 4, violin, is, 356, mm, 14, 0, in, smaller, in, some, 17th, century, models, a, 3, 4, violin, s, body, length, is, 335, mm, 13, 2, in, and, a, 1, 2, size, is, 310, mm, 12, 2, in, with, the, violin, s, closest, family, member, the, viola, size, is, specified, as, body, length, in, inches, or, centimeters, rather, than, fractional, sizes, a, full, size, viola, averages, 40, cm, 16, in, however, each, individual, adult, will, determine, which, size, of, viola, to, use, occasionally, an, adult, with, a, small, frame, may, use, a, so, called, 7, 8, size, violin, instead, of, a, full, size, instrument, sometimes, called, a, lady, s, violin, these, instruments, are, slightly, shorter, than, a, full, size, violin, but, tend, to, be, high, quality, instruments, capable, of, producing, a, sound, comparable, to, that, of, fine, full, size, violins, the, sizes, of, 5, string, violins, may, differ, from, the, normal, 4, string, the, instrument, which, corresponds, to, the, violin, in, the, violin, octet, is, the, mezzo, violin, tuned, the, same, as, a, violin, but, with, a, slightly, longer, body, the, strings, of, the, mezzo, violin, are, the, same, length, as, those, of, the, standard, violin, this, instrument, is, not, in, common, use, violins, are, tuned, by, turning, the, pegs, in, the, pegbox, under, the, scroll, or, by, adjusting, the, fine, tuner, screws, at, the, tailpiece, all, violins, have, pegs, fine, tuners, also, called, fine, adjusters, are, optional, most, fine, tuners, consist, of, a, metal, screw, that, moves, a, lever, attached, to, the, string, end, they, permit, very, small, pitch, adjustments, much, more, easily, than, the, pegs, turning, a, fine, tuner, clockwise, causes, the, pitch, to, become, sharper, as, the, string, is, under, more, tension, and, turning, it, counterclockwise, the, pitch, becomes, flatter, as, the, string, is, under, less, tension, fine, tuners, on, all, four, of, the, strings, are, very, helpful, when, using, those, with, a, steel, core, and, some, players, use, them, with, synthetic, strings, since, modern, e, strings, are, steel, a, fine, tuner, is, nearly, always, fitted, for, that, string, fine, tuners, are, not, used, with, gut, strings, which, are, more, elastic, than, steel, or, synthetic, core, strings, and, do, not, respond, adequately, to, the, very, small, movements, of, fine, tuners, to, tune, a, violin, the, a, string, is, first, tuned, to, a, standard, pitch, usually, a, 440, hz, when, accompanying, or, playing, with, a, fixed, pitch, instrument, such, as, a, piano, or, accordion, the, violin, tunes, to, the, corresponding, note, on, that, instrument, rather, than, to, any, other, tuning, reference, the, oboe, is, generally, the, instrument, used, to, tune, orchestras, where, violins, are, present, since, its, sound, is, penetrating, and, can, be, heard, over, the, other, woodwinds, the, other, strings, are, then, tuned, against, each, other, in, intervals, of, perfect, fifths, by, bowing, them, in, pairs, a, minutely, higher, tuning, is, sometimes, employed, for, solo, playing, to, give, the, instrument, a, brighter, sound, conversely, baroque, music, is, sometimes, played, using, lower, tunings, to, make, the, violin, s, sound, more, gentle, after, tuning, the, instrument, s, bridge, may, be, examined, to, ensure, that, it, is, standing, straight, and, centered, between, the, inner, nicks, of, the, f, holes, a, crooked, bridge, may, significantly, affect, the, sound, of, an, otherwise, well, made, violin, after, extensive, playing, the, tuning, pegs, and, their, holes, can, become, worn, making, the, pegs, more, likely, to, slip, under, tension, a, slipping, peg, leads, to, the, pitch, of, the, string, dropping, somewhat, or, if, the, peg, becomes, completely, loose, to, the, string, completely, losing, tension, a, violin, in, which, the, tuning, pegs, are, slipping, needs, to, be, repaired, by, a, luthier, or, violin, repairperson, peg, dope, or, peg, compound, used, regularly, can, delay, the, onset, of, such, wear, while, allowing, the, pegs, to, turn, smoothly, the, tuning, g, d, a, e, is, used, for, most, violin, music, including, classical, music, jazz, and, folk, music, other, tunings, are, occasionally, employed, the, g, string, for, example, can, be, tuned, up, to, a, the, use, of, nonstandard, tunings, in, classical, music, is, known, as, scordatura, in, some, folk, styles, it, is, called, cross, tuning, one, famous, example, of, scordatura, in, classical, music, is, camille, saint, sa, ns, danse, macabre, where, the, solo, violin, s, e, string, is, tuned, down, to, e, to, impart, an, eerie, dissonance, to, the, composition, other, examples, are, the, third, movement, of, contrasts, by, b, la, bart, k, where, the, e, string, is, tuned, down, to, e, and, the, g, tuned, to, a, g, niccol, paganini, s, first, violin, concerto, where, all, four, strings, are, designated, to, be, tuned, a, semitone, higher, and, the, mystery, sonatas, by, biber, in, which, each, movement, has, different, scordatura, tuning, in, indian, classical, music, and, indian, light, music, the, violin, is, likely, to, be, tuned, to, d, a, d, a, in, the, south, indian, style, as, there, is, no, concept, of, absolute, pitch, in, indian, classical, music, musicians, can, use, any, convenient, tuning, to, maintain, these, relative, pitch, intervals, between, the, strings, another, prevalent, tuning, with, these, intervals, is, b, f, b, f, which, corresponds, to, sa, pa, sa, pa, in, the, indian, carnatic, classical, music, style, in, the, north, indian, hindustani, style, the, tuning, is, usually, pa, sa, pa, sa, instead, of, sa, pa, sa, pa, this, could, correspond, to, f, b, f, b, for, instance, in, iranian, classical, music, and, iranian, light, music, the, violin, has, different, tunings, in, each, dastgah, it, is, likely, to, be, tuned, e, a, e, a, in, dastgah, h, esfahan, or, in, dastg, h, e, ur, is, e, a, d, e, and, e, a, e, e, in, dastg, h, e, m, hur, is, e, a, d, a, in, arabic, classical, music, the, a, and, e, strings, are, lowered, by, a, whole, step, i, e, g, d, g, d, this, is, to, ease, playing, arabic, maqams, especially, those, containing, quarter, tones, while, most, violins, have, four, strings, there, are, violins, with, additional, strings, some, with, as, many, as, seven, seven, is, generally, thought, to, be, the, maximum, number, of, strings, practical, on, a, bowed, string, instrument, with, more, than, seven, strings, it, would, be, impossible, to, play, any, particular, inner, string, individually, with, the, bow, violins, with, seven, strings, are, very, rare, the, extra, strings, on, such, violins, typically, are, lower, in, pitch, than, the, g, string, these, strings, are, usually, tuned, going, from, the, highest, added, string, to, the, lowest, to, c, f, and, b, if, the, instrument, s, playing, length, or, string, length, from, nut, to, bridge, is, equal, to, that, of, an, ordinary, full, scale, violin, i, e, a, bit, less, than, 13, inches, 33, cm, then, it, may, be, properly, termed, a, violin, some, such, instruments, are, somewhat, longer, and, should, be, regarded, as, violas, violins, with, five, strings, or, more, are, typically, used, in, jazz, or, folk, music, some, custom, made, instruments, have, extra, strings, which, are, not, bowed, but, which, sound, sympathetically, due, to, the, vibrations, of, the, bowed, strings, a, violin, is, usually, played, using, a, bow, consisting, of, a, stick, with, a, ribbon, of, horsehair, strung, between, the, tip, and, frog, or, nut, or, heel, at, opposite, ends, a, typical, violin, bow, may, be, 75, cm, 30, in, overall, and, weigh, about, 60, g, 2, 1, oz, viola, bows, may, be, about, 5, mm, 0, 20, in, shorter, and, 10, g, 0, 35, oz, heavier, at, the, frog, end, a, screw, adjuster, tightens, or, loosens, the, hair, just, forward, of, the, frog, a, leather, thumb, cushion, called, the, grip, and, a, winding, protect, the, stick, and, provide, a, secure, hold, for, the, player, s, hand, traditional, windings, are, of, wire, often, silver, or, plated, silver, silk, or, baleen, whalebone, now, substituted, by, alternating, strips, of, tan, and, black, plastic, some, fiberglass, student, bows, employ, a, plastic, sleeve, as, both, grip, and, winding, bow, hair, traditionally, comes, from, the, tail, of, a, grey, male, horse, which, has, predominantly, white, hair, some, cheaper, bows, use, synthetic, fiber, solid, rosin, is, rubbed, onto, the, hair, to, render, it, slightly, sticky, when, the, bow, is, drawn, across, a, string, the, friction, between, them, makes, the, string, vibrate, traditional, materials, for, the, more, costly, bow, sticks, include, snakewood, and, brazilwood, which, is, also, known, as, pernambuco, wood, some, recent, bow, design, innovations, use, carbon, fiber, codabows, for, the, stick, at, all, levels, of, craftsmanship, inexpensive, bows, for, students, are, made, of, less, costly, timbers, or, from, fiberglass, glasser, the, violin, is, played, either, seated, or, standing, up, solo, players, whether, playing, alone, with, a, piano, or, with, an, orchestra, play, mostly, standing, up, unless, prevented, by, a, physical, disability, such, as, in, the, case, of, itzhak, perlman, in, contrast, in, the, orchestra, and, in, chamber, music, it, is, usually, played, seated, in, the, 2000s, and, 2010s, some, orchestras, performing, baroque, music, such, as, the, freiburg, baroque, orchestra, have, had, all, of, their, violins, and, violas, solo, and, ensemble, perform, standing, up, the, standard, way, of, holding, the, violin, is, with, the, left, side, of, the, jaw, resting, on, the, chinrest, of, the, violin, and, supported, by, the, left, shoulder, often, assisted, by, a, shoulder, rest, or, a, sponge, and, an, elastic, band, for, younger, players, who, struggle, with, shoulder, rests, the, jaw, and, the, shoulder, must, hold, the, violin, firmly, enough, to, allow, it, to, remain, stable, when, the, left, hand, goes, from, a, high, position, a, high, pitched, note, far, up, on, the, fingerboard, to, a, low, one, nearer, to, the, pegbox, in, the, indian, posture, the, stability, of, the, violin, is, guaranteed, by, its, scroll, resting, on, the, side, of, the, foot, while, teachers, point, out, the, vital, importance, of, good, posture, both, for, the, sake, of, the, quality, of, the, playing, and, to, reduce, the, chance, of, repetitive, strain, injury, advice, as, to, what, good, posture, is, and, how, to, achieve, it, differs, in, details, however, all, insist, on, the, importance, of, a, natural, relaxed, position, without, tension, or, rigidity, things, which, are, almost, universally, recommended, are, keeping, the, left, wrist, straight, or, very, nearly, so, to, allow, the, fingers, of, the, left, hand, to, move, freely, and, to, reduce, the, chance, of, injury, and, keeping, either, shoulder, in, a, natural, relaxed, position, and, avoiding, raising, either, of, them, in, an, exaggerated, manner, this, like, any, other, unwarranted, tension, would, limit, freedom, of, motion, and, increase, the, risk, of, injury, hunching, can, hamper, good, playing, because, it, throws, the, body, off, balance, and, makes, the, shoulders, rise, another, sign, that, comes, from, unhealthy, tension, is, pain, in, the, left, hand, which, indicates, too, much, pressure, when, holding, the, violin, the, left, hand, determines, the, sounding, length, of, the, string, and, thus, the, pitch, of, the, string, by, stopping, it, pressing, it, against, the, fingerboard, with, the, fingertips, producing, different, pitches, as, the, violin, has, no, frets, to, stop, the, strings, as, is, usual, with, the, guitar, the, player, must, know, exactly, where, to, place, the, fingers, on, the, strings, to, play, with, good, intonation, tuning, beginning, violinists, play, open, strings, and, the, lowest, position, nearest, to, the, nut, students, often, start, with, relatively, easy, keys, such, as, a, major, and, g, major, students, are, taught, scales, and, simple, melodies, through, practice, of, scales, and, arpeggios, and, ear, training, the, violinist, s, left, hand, eventually, finds, the, notes, intuitively, by, muscle, memory, beginners, sometimes, rely, on, tapes, placed, on, the, fingerboard, for, proper, left, hand, finger, placement, but, usually, abandon, the, tapes, quickly, as, they, advance, another, commonly, used, marking, technique, uses, dots, of, white, out, on, the, fingerboard, which, wear, off, in, a, few, weeks, of, regular, practice, this, practice, unfortunately, is, used, sometimes, in, lieu, of, adequate, ear, training, guiding, the, placement, of, fingers, by, eye, and, not, by, ear, especially, in, the, early, stages, of, learning, to, play, the, so, called, ringing, tones, are, useful, there, are, nine, such, notes, in, first, position, where, a, stopped, note, sounds, a, unison, or, octave, with, another, open, string, causing, it, to, resonate, sympathetically, students, often, use, these, ringing, tones, to, check, the, intonation, of, the, stopped, note, by, seeing, if, it, is, harmonious, with, the, open, string, for, example, when, playing, the, stopped, pitch, a, on, the, g, string, the, violinist, could, play, the, open, d, string, at, the, same, time, to, check, the, intonation, of, the, stopped, a, if, the, a, is, in, tune, the, a, and, the, open, d, string, should, produce, a, harmonious, perfect, fourth, violins, are, tuned, in, perfect, fifths, like, all, the, orchestral, strings, violin, viola, cello, except, the, double, bass, which, is, tuned, in, perfect, fourths, each, subsequent, note, is, stopped, at, a, pitch, the, player, perceives, as, the, most, harmonious, when, unaccompanied, does, not, play, consistently, in, either, the, tempered, or, the, natural, scale, but, tends, on, the, whole, to, conform, with, the, pythagorean, scale, when, violinists, are, playing, in, a, string, quartet, or, a, string, orchestra, the, strings, typically, sweeten, their, tuning, to, suit, the, key, they, are, playing, in, when, playing, with, an, instrument, tuned, to, equal, temperament, such, as, a, piano, skilled, violinists, adjust, their, tuning, to, match, the, equal, temperament, of, the, piano, to, avoid, discordant, notes, the, fingers, are, conventionally, numbered, 1, index, through, 4, little, finger, in, music, notation, such, as, sheet, music, and, etude, books, especially, in, instructional, editions, of, violin, music, numbers, over, the, notes, may, indicate, which, finger, to, use, with, 0, or, o, indicating, an, open, string, the, chart, to, the, right, shows, the, arrangement, of, notes, reachable, in, first, position, not, shown, on, this, chart, is, the, way, the, spacing, between, note, positions, becomes, closer, as, the, fingers, move, up, in, pitch, from, the, nut, the, bars, at, the, sides, of, the, chart, represent, the, usual, possibilities, for, beginners, tape, placements, at, 1st, high, 2nd, 3rd, and, 4th, fingers, the, placement, of, the, left, hand, on, the, fingerboard, is, characterized, by, positions, first, position, where, most, beginners, start, although, some, methods, start, in, third, position, is, the, most, commonly, used, position, in, string, music, music, composed, for, beginning, youth, orchestras, is, often, mostly, in, first, position, the, lowest, note, available, in, this, position, in, standard, tuning, is, an, open, g3, the, highest, note, in, first, position, is, played, with, the, fourth, finger, on, the, e, string, sounding, a, b5, moving, the, hand, up, the, neck, the, first, finger, takes, the, place, of, the, second, finger, bringing, the, player, into, second, position, letting, the, first, finger, take, the, first, position, place, of, the, third, finger, brings, the, player, to, third, position, and, so, on, a, change, of, positions, with, its, associated, movement, of, the, hand, is, referred, to, as, a, shift, and, effective, shifting, maintaining, accurate, intonation, and, a, smooth, legato, connected, sound, is, a, key, element, of, technique, at, all, levels, often, a, guide, finger, is, used, the, last, finger, to, play, a, note, in, the, old, position, continuously, lightly, touches, the, string, during, the, course, of, the, shift, to, end, up, on, its, correct, place, in, the, new, position, in, elementary, shifting, exercises, the, guide, finger, is, often, voiced, while, gliding, up, or, down, the, string, so, the, player, can, establish, correct, placement, by, ear, outside, of, these, exercises, it, should, rarely, be, audible, unless, the, performer, is, consciously, applying, a, portamento, effect, for, expressive, reasons, in, the, course, of, a, shift, in, low, positions, the, thumb, of, the, left, hand, moves, up, or, down, the, neck, of, the, instrument, so, as, to, remain, in, the, same, position, relative, to, the, fingers, though, the, movement, of, the, thumb, may, occur, slightly, before, or, slightly, after, the, movement, of, the, fingers, in, such, positions, the, thumb, is, often, thought, of, as, an, anchor, whose, location, defines, what, position, the, player, is, in, in, very, high, positions, the, thumb, is, unable, to, move, with, the, fingers, as, the, body, of, the, instrument, gets, in, the, way, instead, the, thumb, works, around, the, neck, of, the, instrument, to, sit, at, the, point, at, which, the, neck, meets, the, right, bout, of, the, body, and, remains, there, while, the, fingers, move, between, the, high, positions, a, note, played, outside, of, the, normal, compass, of, a, position, without, any, shift, is, referred, to, as, an, extension, for, instance, in, third, position, on, the, a, string, the, hand, naturally, sits, with, the, first, finger, on, d, and, the, fourth, on, either, g, or, g, stretching, the, first, finger, back, down, to, a, c, or, the, fourth, finger, up, to, an, a, forms, an, extension, extensions, are, commonly, used, where, one, or, two, notes, are, slightly, out, of, an, otherwise, solid, position, and, give, the, benefit, of, being, less, intrusive, than, a, shift, or, string, crossing, the, lowest, position, on, the, violin, is, referred, to, as, half, position, in, this, position, the, first, finger, is, on, a, low, first, position, note, e, g, b, on, the, a, string, and, the, fourth, finger, is, in, a, downward, extension, from, its, regular, position, e, g, d, on, the, a, string, with, the, other, two, fingers, placed, in, between, as, required, as, the, position, of, the, thumb, is, typically, the, same, in, half, position, as, in, first, position, it, is, better, thought, of, as, a, backwards, extension, of, the, whole, hand, than, as, a, genuine, position, the, upper, limit, of, the, violin, s, range, is, largely, determined, by, the, skill, of, the, player, who, may, easily, play, more, than, two, octaves, on, a, single, string, and, four, octaves, on, the, instrument, as, a, whole, position, names, are, mostly, used, for, the, lower, positions, and, in, method, books, and, etudes, for, this, reason, it, is, uncommon, to, hear, references, to, anything, higher, than, seventh, position, the, highest, position, practically, speaking, is, 13th, position, very, high, positions, are, a, particular, technical, challenge, for, two, reasons, firstly, the, difference, in, location, of, different, notes, becomes, much, narrower, in, high, positions, making, the, notes, more, challenging, to, locate, and, in, some, cases, to, distinguish, by, ear, secondly, the, much, shorter, sounding, length, of, the, string, in, very, high, positions, is, a, challenge, for, the, right, arm, and, bow, in, sounding, the, instrument, effectively, the, finer, and, more, expensive, an, instrument, the, better, able, it, is, to, sustain, good, tone, right, to, the, top, of, the, fingerboard, at, the, highest, pitches, on, the, e, string, all, notes, except, those, below, the, open, d, can, be, played, on, more, than, one, string, this, is, a, standard, design, feature, of, stringed, instruments, however, it, differs, from, the, piano, which, has, only, one, location, for, each, of, its, 88, notes, for, instance, the, note, of, open, a, on, the, violin, can, be, played, as, the, open, a, or, on, the, d, string, in, first, to, fourth, positions, or, even, on, the, g, string, very, high, up, in, sixth, to, ninth, positions, each, string, has, a, different, tone, quality, because, of, the, different, weights, thicknesses, of, the, strings, and, because, of, the, resonances, of, other, open, strings, for, instance, the, g, string, is, often, regarded, as, having, a, very, full, sonorous, sound, which, is, particularly, appropriate, to, late, romantic, music, this, is, often, indicated, in, the, music, by, the, marking, for, example, sul, g, or, iv, a, roman, numeral, indicating, to, play, on, the, fourth, string, by, convention, the, strings, are, numbered, from, thinnest, highest, pitch, i, to, the, lowest, pitch, iv, even, without, an, explicit, instructions, in, the, score, an, advanced, violinist, will, use, her, his, discretion, and, artistic, sensibility, to, select, which, string, to, play, specific, notes, or, passages, if, a, string, is, bowed, or, plucked, without, any, finger, stopping, it, it, is, said, to, be, an, open, string, this, gives, a, different, sound, from, a, stopped, string, since, the, string, vibrates, more, freely, at, the, nut, than, under, a, finger, further, it, is, impossible, to, use, vibrato, fully, on, an, open, string, though, a, partial, effect, can, be, achieved, by, stopping, a, note, an, octave, up, on, an, adjacent, string, and, vibrating, that, which, introduces, an, element, of, vibrato, into, the, overtones, in, the, classical, tradition, violinists, will, often, use, a, string, crossing, or, shift, of, position, to, allow, them, to, avoid, the, change, of, timbre, introduced, by, an, open, string, unless, indicated, by, the, composer, this, is, particularly, true, for, the, open, e, which, is, often, regarded, as, having, a, harsh, sound, however, there, are, also, situations, where, an, open, string, may, be, specifically, chosen, for, artistic, effect, this, is, seen, in, classical, music, which, is, imitating, the, drone, of, an, organ, j, s, bach, in, his, partita, in, e, for, solo, violin, achieved, this, fiddling, e, g, hoedown, or, where, taking, steps, to, avoid, the, open, string, is, musically, inappropriate, for, instance, in, baroque, music, where, shifting, position, was, less, common, in, quick, passages, of, scales, or, arpeggios, an, open, e, string, may, simply, be, used, for, convenience, if, the, note, does, not, have, time, to, ring, and, develop, a, harsh, timbre, in, folk, music, fiddling, and, other, traditional, music, genres, open, strings, are, commonly, used, for, their, resonant, timbre, playing, an, open, string, simultaneously, with, a, stopped, note, on, an, adjacent, string, produces, a, bagpipe, like, drone, often, used, by, composers, in, imitation, of, folk, music, sometimes, the, two, notes, are, identical, for, instance, playing, a, fingered, a, on, the, d, string, against, the, open, a, string, giving, a, ringing, sort, of, fiddling, sound, playing, an, open, string, simultaneously, with, an, identical, stopped, note, can, also, be, called, for, when, more, volume, is, required, especially, in, orchestral, playing, some, classical, violin, parts, have, notes, for, which, the, composer, requests, the, violinist, to, play, an, open, string, because, of, the, specific, sonority, created, by, an, open, string, double, stopping, is, when, two, separate, strings, are, stopped, by, the, fingers, and, bowed, simultaneously, producing, two, continuous, tones, typical, intervals, include, 3rds, 4ths, 5ths, 6ths, and, octaves, double, stops, can, be, indicated, in, any, position, though, the, widest, interval, that, can, be, double, stopped, naturally, in, one, position, is, an, octave, with, the, index, finger, on, the, lower, string, and, the, pinky, finger, on, the, higher, string, nonetheless, intervals, of, tenths, or, even, more, are, sometimes, required, to, be, double, stopped, in, advanced, repertoire, resulting, in, a, stretched, left, hand, position, with, the, fingers, extended, the, term, double, stop, is, often, used, to, encompass, sounding, an, open, string, alongside, a, fingered, note, as, well, even, though, only, one, finger, stops, the, string, where, three, or, four, simultaneous, notes, are, indicated, the, violinist, will, typically, split, the, chord, choosing, the, lower, one, or, two, notes, to, play, first, before, immediately, continuing, onto, the, upper, one, or, two, notes, with, the, natural, resonance, of, the, instrument, producing, an, effect, similar, to, if, all, four, notes, had, been, voiced, simultaneously, in, some, circumstances, a, triple, stop, is, possible, where, three, notes, across, three, strings, can, be, voiced, simultaneously, the, bow, will, not, naturally, strike, three, strings, at, once, but, if, there, is, sufficient, bow, speed, and, pressure, when, the, violinist, breaks, sounds, a, three, note, chord, the, bow, hair, can, be, bent, temporarily, onto, three, strings, allowing, each, to, sound, simultaneously, this, is, accomplished, with, a, heavy, stroke, typically, near, the, frog, and, produces, a, loud, and, aggressive, tone, double, stops, in, orchestra, are, occasionally, marked, divisi, and, divided, between, the, players, with, some, division, of, the, musicians, playing, the, lower, note, and, some, division, playing, the, higher, note, double, stops, and, divisi, are, common, in, orchestral, repertoire, when, the, violins, play, accompaniment, and, another, instrument, or, section, plays, melodically, in, some, genres, of, historically, informed, performance, usually, of, baroque, music, and, earlier, neither, split, chord, nor, triple, stop, chords, are, thought, to, be, appropriate, some, violinists, will, arpeggiate, all, chords, including, regular, double, stops, playing, all, or, most, notes, individually, as, if, they, had, been, written, as, a, slurred, figure, however, with, the, development, of, modern, violins, triple, stopping, has, become, more, natural, due, to, the, bridge, being, less, curved, in, some, musical, styles, a, sustained, open, string, drone, can, be, played, during, a, passage, mainly, written, on, an, adjacent, string, to, provide, a, basic, accompaniment, this, is, more, often, seen, in, folk, traditions, than, in, classical, music, vibrato, is, a, technique, of, the, left, hand, and, arm, in, which, the, pitch, of, a, note, varies, subtly, in, a, pulsating, rhythm, while, various, parts, of, the, hand, or, arm, may, be, involved, in, the, motion, the, result, is, a, movement, of, the, fingertip, bringing, about, a, slight, change, in, vibrating, string, length, which, causes, an, undulation, in, pitch, most, violinists, oscillate, below, the, note, or, lower, in, pitch, from, the, actual, note, when, using, vibrato, since, it, is, believed, that, perception, favors, the, highest, pitch, in, a, varying, sound, vibrato, does, little, if, anything, to, disguise, an, out, of, tune, note, in, other, words, misapplied, vibrato, is, a, poor, substitute, for, good, intonation, scales, and, other, exercises, meant, to, work, on, intonation, are, typically, played, without, vibrato, to, make, the, work, easier, and, more, effective, music, students, are, often, taught, that, unless, otherwise, marked, in, music, vibrato, is, assumed, however, it, has, to, be, noted, that, this, is, only, a, trend, there, is, nothing, on, the, sheet, music, that, compels, violinists, to, add, vibrato, this, can, be, an, obstacle, to, a, classically, trained, violinist, wishing, to, play, in, a, style, that, uses, little, or, no, vibrato, at, all, such, as, baroque, music, played, in, period, style, and, many, traditional, fiddling, styles, vibrato, can, be, produced, by, a, proper, combination, of, finger, wrist, and, arm, motions, one, method, called, hand, vibrato, or, wrist, vibrato, involves, rocking, the, hand, back, at, the, wrist, to, achieve, oscillation, in, contrast, another, method, arm, vibrato, modulates, the, pitch, by, movement, at, the, elbow, a, combination, of, these, techniques, allows, a, player, to, produce, a, large, variety, of, tonal, effects, the, when, and, what, for, and, how, much, of, violin, vibrato, are, artistic, matters, of, style, and, taste, with, different, teachers, music, schools, and, styles, of, music, favouring, different, styles, of, vibrato, for, example, overdone, vibrato, may, become, distracting, in, acoustic, terms, the, interest, that, vibrato, adds, to, the, sound, has, to, do, with, the, way, that, the, overtone, mix, or, tone, color, or, timbre, and, the, directional, pattern, of, sound, projection, change, with, changes, in, pitch, by, pointing, the, sound, at, different, parts, of, the, room, in, a, rhythmic, way, vibrato, adds, a, shimmer, or, liveliness, to, the, sound, of, a, well, made, violin, vibrato, is, in, a, large, part, left, to, the, discretion, of, the, violinist, different, types, of, vibrato, will, bring, different, moods, to, the, piece, and, the, varying, degrees, and, styles, of, vibrato, are, often, characteristics, that, stand, out, in, well, known, violinists, a, vibrato, like, motion, can, sometimes, be, used, to, create, a, fast, trill, effect, to, execute, this, effect, the, finger, above, the, finger, stopping, the, note, is, placed, very, slightly, off, the, string, firmly, pressed, against, the, finger, stopping, the, string, and, a, vibrato, motion, is, implemented, the, second, finger, will, lightly, touch, the, string, above, the, lower, finger, with, each, oscillation, causing, the, pitch, to, oscillate, in, a, fashion, that, sounds, like, a, mix, between, wide, vibrato, and, a, very, fast, trill, this, gives, a, less, defined, transition, between, the, higher, and, lower, note, and, is, usually, implemented, by, interpretative, choice, this, trill, technique, only, works, well, for, semi, tonal, trills, or, trills, in, high, positions, where, the, distance, between, notes, is, lessened, as, it, requires, the, trilling, finger, and, the, finger, below, it, to, be, touching, limiting, the, distance, that, can, be, trilled, in, very, high, positions, where, the, trilled, distance, is, less, than, the, width, of, the, finger, a, vibrato, trill, may, be, the, only, option, for, trill, effects, a, major, scale, arco, and, pizzicato, beginning, of, an, a, major, scale, with, vibrato, a, major, scale, played, col, legno, natural, harmonics, of, an, a, e, and, an, a, artificial, false, harmonic, of, a, 7, lightly, touching, the, string, with, a, fingertip, at, a, harmonic, node, but, without, fully, pressing, the, string, and, then, plucking, or, bowing, the, string, creates, harmonics, instead, of, the, normal, tone, a, higher, pitched, note, sounds, each, node, is, at, an, integer, division, of, the, string, for, example, half, way, or, one, third, along, the, length, of, the, string, a, responsive, instrument, will, sound, numerous, possible, harmonic, nodes, along, the, length, of, the, string, harmonics, are, marked, in, music, either, with, a, little, circle, above, the, note, that, determines, the, pitch, of, the, harmonic, or, by, diamond, shaped, note, heads, there, are, two, types, of, harmonics, natural, harmonics, and, artificial, harmonics, also, known, as, false, harmonics, natural, harmonics, are, played, on, an, open, string, the, pitch, of, the, open, string, when, it, is, plucked, or, bowed, is, called, the, fundamental, frequency, harmonics, are, also, called, overtones, or, partials, they, occur, at, whole, number, multiples, of, the, fundamental, which, is, called, the, first, harmonic, the, second, harmonic, is, the, first, overtone, the, octave, above, the, open, string, the, third, harmonic, is, the, second, overtone, and, so, on, the, second, harmonic, is, in, the, middle, of, the, string, and, sounds, an, octave, higher, than, the, string, s, pitch, the, third, harmonic, breaks, the, string, into, thirds, and, sounds, an, octave, and, a, fifth, above, the, fundamental, and, the, fourth, harmonic, breaks, the, string, into, quarters, sounding, two, octaves, above, the, first, the, sound, of, the, second, harmonic, is, the, clearest, of, them, all, because, it, is, a, common, node, with, all, the, succeeding, even, numbered, harmonics, 4th, 6th, etc, the, third, and, succeeding, odd, numbered, harmonics, are, harder, to, play, because, they, break, the, string, into, an, odd, number, of, vibrating, parts, and, do, not, share, as, many, nodes, with, other, harmonics, artificial, harmonics, are, more, difficult, to, produce, than, natural, harmonics, as, they, involve, both, stopping, the, string, and, playing, a, harmonic, on, the, stopped, note, using, the, octave, frame, the, normal, distance, between, the, first, and, fourth, fingers, in, any, given, position, with, the, fourth, finger, just, touching, the, string, a, fourth, higher, than, the, stopped, note, produces, the, fourth, harmonic, two, octaves, above, the, stopped, note, finger, placement, and, pressure, as, well, as, bow, speed, pressure, and, sounding, point, are, all, essential, in, getting, the, desired, harmonic, to, sound, and, to, add, to, the, challenge, in, passages, with, different, notes, played, as, false, harmonics, the, distance, between, stopping, finger, and, harmonic, finger, must, constantly, change, since, the, spacing, between, notes, changes, along, the, length, of, the, string, the, harmonic, finger, can, also, touch, at, a, major, third, above, the, pressed, note, the, fifth, harmonic, or, a, fifth, higher, a, third, harmonic, these, harmonics, are, less, commonly, used, in, the, case, of, the, major, third, both, the, stopped, note, and, touched, note, must, be, played, slightly, sharp, otherwise, the, harmonic, does, not, speak, as, readily, in, the, case, of, the, fifth, the, stretch, is, greater, than, is, comfortable, for, many, violinists, in, the, general, repertoire, fractions, smaller, than, a, sixth, are, not, used, however, divisions, up, to, an, eighth, are, sometimes, used, and, given, a, good, instrument, and, a, skilled, player, divisions, as, small, as, a, twelfth, are, possible, there, are, a, few, books, dedicated, solely, to, the, study, of, violin, harmonics, two, comprehensive, works, are, henryk, heller, s, seven, volume, theory, of, harmonics, published, by, simrock, in, 1928, and, michelangelo, abbado, s, five, volume, tecnica, dei, suoni, armonici, published, by, ricordi, in, 1934, elaborate, passages, in, artificial, harmonics, can, be, found, in, virtuoso, violin, literature, especially, of, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, two, notable, examples, of, this, are, an, entire, section, of, vittorio, monti, s, cs, rd, s, and, a, passage, towards, the, middle, of, the, third, movement, of, pyotr, ilyich, tchaikovsky, s, violin, concerto, a, section, of, the, third, movement, of, paganini, s, violin, concerto, no, 1, consists, of, double, stopped, thirds, in, harmonics, when, strings, are, worn, dirty, and, old, the, harmonics, may, no, longer, be, accurate, in, pitch, for, this, reason, violinists, change, their, strings, regularly, the, strings, may, be, sounded, by, drawing, the, hair, of, the, bow, held, by, the, right, hand, across, them, arco, or, by, plucking, them, pizzicato, most, often, with, the, right, hand, in, some, cases, the, violinist, will, pluck, strings, with, the, left, hand, this, is, done, to, facilitate, transitions, from, pizzicato, to, arco, playing, it, is, also, used, in, some, virtuoso, showpieces, left, hand, pizzicato, is, usually, done, on, open, strings, pizzicato, is, used, on, all, of, the, violin, family, instruments, however, the, systematic, study, of, advanced, pizzicato, techniques, is, most, developed, in, jazz, bass, a, style, in, which, the, instrument, is, almost, exclusively, plucked, the, right, arm, hand, and, bow, and, the, bow, speed, are, responsible, for, tone, quality, rhythm, dynamics, articulation, and, most, but, not, all, changes, in, timbre, the, player, draws, the, bow, over, the, string, causing, the, string, to, vibrate, and, produce, a, sustained, tone, the, bow, is, a, wooden, stick, with, tensioned, horsetail, hair, which, has, been, rosined, with, a, bar, of, rosin, the, natural, texture, of, the, horsehair, and, the, stickiness, of, the, rosin, help, the, bow, to, grip, the, string, and, thus, when, the, bow, is, drawn, over, the, string, the, bow, causes, the, string, to, sound, a, pitch, bowing, can, be, used, to, produce, long, sustained, notes, or, melodies, with, a, string, section, if, the, players, in, a, section, change, their, bows, at, different, times, a, note, can, seem, to, be, endlessly, sustainable, as, well, the, bow, can, be, used, to, play, short, crisp, little, notes, such, as, repeated, notes, scales, and, arpeggios, which, provide, a, propulsive, rhythm, in, many, styles, of, music, the, most, essential, part, of, bowing, technique, is, the, bow, grip, it, is, usually, with, the, thumb, bent, in, the, small, area, between, the, frog, and, the, winding, of, the, bow, the, other, fingers, are, spread, somewhat, evenly, across, the, top, part, of, the, bow, the, pinky, finger, is, curled, with, the, tip, of, the, finger, placed, on, the, wood, next, to, the, screw, the, violin, produces, louder, notes, with, greater, bow, speed, or, more, weight, on, the, string, the, two, methods, are, not, equivalent, because, they, produce, different, timbres, pressing, down, on, the, string, tends, to, produce, a, harsher, more, intense, sound, one, can, also, achieve, a, louder, sound, by, placing, the, bow, closer, to, the, bridge, the, sounding, point, where, the, bow, intersects, the, string, also, influences, timbre, or, tone, colour, playing, close, to, the, bridge, sul, ponticello, gives, a, more, intense, sound, than, usual, emphasizing, the, higher, harmonics, and, playing, with, the, bow, over, the, end, of, the, fingerboard, sul, tasto, makes, for, a, delicate, ethereal, sound, emphasizing, the, fundamental, frequency, shinichi, suzuki, referred, to, the, sounding, point, as, the, kreisler, highway, one, may, think, of, different, sounding, points, as, lanes, in, the, highway, various, methods, of, attack, with, the, bow, produce, different, articulations, there, are, many, bowing, techniques, that, allow, for, every, range, of, playing, style, many, teachers, players, and, orchestras, spend, a, lot, of, time, developing, techniques, and, creating, a, unified, technique, within, the, group, these, techniques, include, legato, style, bowing, a, smooth, connected, sustained, sound, suitable, for, melodies, coll, and, a, variety, of, bowings, which, produce, shorter, notes, including, ricochet, sautill, martel, spiccato, and, staccato, a, note, marked, pizz, abbreviation, for, pizzicato, in, the, written, music, is, to, be, played, by, plucking, the, string, with, a, finger, of, the, right, hand, rather, than, by, bowing, the, index, finger, is, most, commonly, used, here, sometimes, in, orchestra, parts, or, virtuoso, solo, music, where, the, bow, hand, is, occupied, or, for, show, off, effect, left, hand, pizzicato, will, be, indicated, by, a, plus, sign, below, or, above, the, note, in, left, hand, pizzicato, two, fingers, are, put, on, the, string, one, usually, the, index, or, middle, finger, is, put, on, the, correct, note, and, the, other, usually, the, ring, finger, or, little, finger, is, put, above, the, note, the, higher, finger, then, plucks, the, string, while, the, lower, one, stays, on, thus, producing, the, correct, pitch, by, increasing, the, force, of, the, pluck, one, can, increase, the, volume, of, the, note, that, the, string, is, producing, pizzicato, is, used, in, orchestral, works, and, in, solo, showpieces, in, orchestral, parts, violinists, often, have, to, make, very, quick, shifts, from, arco, to, pizzicato, and, vice, versa, a, marking, of, col, legno, italian, for, with, the, wood, in, the, written, music, calls, for, striking, the, string, s, with, the, stick, of, the, bow, rather, than, by, drawing, the, hair, of, the, bow, across, the, strings, this, bowing, technique, is, somewhat, rarely, used, and, results, in, a, muted, percussive, sound, the, eerie, quality, of, a, violin, section, playing, col, legno, is, exploited, in, some, symphonic, pieces, notably, the, witches, dance, of, the, last, movement, of, berlioz, s, symphonie, fantastique, saint, sa, ns, s, symphonic, poem, danse, macabre, includes, the, string, section, using, the, col, legno, technique, to, imitate, the, sound, of, dancing, skeletons, mars, from, gustav, holst, s, the, planets, uses, col, legno, to, play, a, repeated, rhythm, in, 5, 4, time, signature, benjamin, britten, s, the, young, person, s, guide, to, the, orchestra, demands, its, use, in, the, percussion, variation, dmitri, shostakovich, uses, it, in, his, fourteenth, symphony, in, the, movement, at, the, sante, jail, some, violinists, however, object, to, this, style, of, playing, as, it, can, damage, the, finish, and, impair, the, value, of, a, fine, bow, but, most, of, such, will, compromise, by, using, a, cheap, bow, for, at, least, the, duration, of, the, passage, in, question, a, smooth, and, even, stroke, during, which, bow, speed, and, weight, are, the, same, from, beginning, of, the, stroke, to, the, end, literally, hammered, a, strongly, accented, effect, produced, by, releasing, each, bowstroke, forcefully, and, suddenly, martel, can, be, played, in, any, part, of, the, bow, it, is, sometimes, indicated, in, written, music, by, an, arrowhead, tremolo, is, the, very, rapid, repetition, typically, of, a, single, note, but, occasionally, of, multiple, notes, usually, played, at, the, tip, of, the, bow, tremolo, is, marked, with, three, short, slanted, lines, across, the, stem, of, the, note, tremolo, is, often, used, as, a, sound, effect, in, orchestral, music, particularly, in, the, romantic, music, era, 1800, 1910, and, in, opera, music, attaching, a, small, metal, rubber, leather, or, wooden, device, called, a, mute, or, sordino, to, the, bridge, of, the, violin, gives, a, softer, more, mellow, tone, with, fewer, audible, overtones, the, sound, of, an, entire, orchestral, string, section, playing, with, mutes, has, a, hushed, quality, the, mute, changes, both, the, loudness, and, the, timbre, tone, colour, of, a, violin, the, conventional, italian, markings, for, mute, usage, are, con, sord, or, con, sordino, meaning, with, mute, and, senza, sord, meaning, without, mute, or, via, sord, meaning, mute, off, larger, metal, rubber, or, wooden, mutes, are, widely, available, known, as, practice, mutes, or, hotel, mutes, such, mutes, are, generally, not, used, in, performance, but, are, used, to, deaden, the, sound, of, the, violin, in, practice, areas, such, as, hotel, rooms, for, practicing, purposes, there, is, also, the, mute, violin, a, violin, without, a, sound, box, some, composers, have, used, practice, mutes, for, special, effect, for, example, at, the, end, of, luciano, berio, s, sequenza, viii, for, solo, violin, since, the, baroque, era, the, violin, has, been, one, of, the, most, important, of, all, instruments, in, classical, music, for, several, reasons, the, tone, of, the, violin, stands, out, above, other, instruments, making, it, appropriate, for, playing, a, melody, line, in, the, hands, of, a, good, player, the, violin, is, extremely, agile, and, can, execute, rapid, and, difficult, sequences, of, notes, violins, make, up, a, large, part, of, an, orchestra, and, are, usually, divided, into, two, sections, known, as, the, first, and, second, violins, composers, often, assign, the, melody, to, the, first, violins, typically, a, more, difficult, part, using, higher, positions, in, contrast, second, violins, play, harmony, accompaniment, patterns, or, the, melody, an, octave, lower, than, the, first, violins, a, string, quartet, similarly, has, parts, for, first, and, second, violins, as, well, as, a, viola, part, and, a, bass, instrument, such, as, the, cello, or, rarely, the, double, bass, the, earliest, references, to, jazz, performance, using, the, violin, as, a, solo, instrument, are, documented, during, the, first, decades, of, the, 20th, century, joe, venuti, one, of, the, first, jazz, violinists, is, known, for, his, work, with, guitarist, eddie, lang, during, the, 1920s, since, that, time, there, have, been, many, improvising, violinists, including, st, phane, grappelli, stuff, smith, eddie, south, regina, carter, johnny, frigo, john, blake, adam, taubitz, leroy, jenkins, and, jean, luc, ponty, while, not, primarily, jazz, violinists, darol, anger, and, mark, o, connor, have, spent, significant, parts, of, their, careers, playing, jazz, the, swiss, cuban, violinist, yilian, ca, izares, mixes, jazz, with, cuban, music, violins, also, appear, in, ensembles, supplying, orchestral, backgrounds, to, many, jazz, recordings, the, indian, violin, while, essentially, the, same, instrument, as, that, used, in, western, music, is, different, in, some, senses, the, instrument, is, tuned, so, that, the, iv, and, iii, strings, g, and, d, on, a, western, tuned, violin, and, the, ii, and, i, a, and, e, strings, are, sa, pa, do, sol, pairs, and, sound, the, same, but, are, offset, by, an, octave, resembling, common, scordatura, or, fiddle, cross, tunings, such, as, g3, d4, g4, d5, or, a3, e4, a4, e5, the, tonic, sa, do, is, not, fixed, but, variably, tuned, to, accommodate, the, vocalist, or, lead, player, the, way, the, musician, holds, the, instrument, varies, from, western, to, indian, music, in, indian, music, the, musician, sits, on, the, floor, cross, legged, with, the, right, foot, out, in, front, of, them, the, scroll, of, the, instrument, rests, on, the, foot, this, position, is, essential, to, playing, well, due, to, the, nature, of, indian, music, the, hand, can, move, all, over, the, fingerboard, and, there, is, no, set, position, for, the, left, hand, so, it, is, important, for, the, violin, to, be, in, a, steady, unmoving, position, up, through, at, least, the, 1970s, most, types, of, popular, music, used, bowed, string, sections, they, were, extensively, used, in, popular, music, throughout, the, 1920s, and, early, 1930s, with, the, rise, of, swing, music, however, from, 1935, to, 1945, the, string, sound, was, often, used, to, add, to, the, fullness, of, big, band, music, following, the, swing, era, from, the, late, 1940s, to, the, mid, 1950s, strings, began, to, be, revived, in, traditional, pop, music, this, trend, accelerated, in, the, late, 1960s, with, a, significant, revival, of, the, use, of, strings, especially, in, soul, music, popular, motown, recordings, of, the, late, 1960s, and, 1970s, relied, heavily, on, strings, as, part, of, their, trademark, texture, with, the, rise, of, electronically, created, music, in, the, 1980s, violins, declined, in, use, as, synthesized, string, sounds, played, by, a, keyboardist, with, a, synthesizer, took, their, place, however, while, the, violin, has, had, very, little, usage, in, mainstream, rock, music, it, has, some, history, in, progressive, rock, e, g, electric, light, orchestra, king, crimson, kansas, gentle, giant, the, instrument, has, a, stronger, place, in, modern, jazz, fusion, bands, notably, the, corrs, the, popularity, of, crossover, music, beginning, in, the, last, years, of, the, 20th, century, has, brought, the, violin, back, into, the, popular, music, arena, with, both, electric, and, acoustic, violins, being, used, by, popular, bands, dave, matthews, band, features, violinist, boyd, tinsley, the, flock, featured, violinist, jerry, goodman, who, later, joined, the, jazz, rock, fusion, band, the, mahavishnu, orchestra, james, saul, davies, who, is, also, a, guitarist, was, enlisted, by, the, band, as, a, violinist, the, folk, metal, band, ithilien, use, violin, extensively, along, their, discography, progressive, metal, band, ne, obliviscaris, feature, a, violin, player, tim, charles, in, their, line, up, independent, artists, such, as, owen, pallett, the, shondes, and, andrew, bird, have, also, spurred, increased, interest, in, the, instrument, indie, bands, have, often, embraced, new, and, unusual, arrangements, allowing, them, more, freedom, to, feature, the, violin, than, many, mainstream, musical, artists, lindsey, stirling, plays, the, violin, in, conjunction, with, electronic, dubstep, trance, rifts, and, beats, eric, stanley, improvises, on, the, violin, with, hip, hop, music, pop, classical, elements, and, instrumental, beats, the, successful, indie, rock, and, baroque, pop, band, arcade, fire, use, violins, extensively, in, their, arrangements, like, many, other, instruments, used, in, classical, music, the, violin, descends, from, remote, ancestors, that, were, used, for, folk, music, following, a, stage, of, intensive, development, in, the, late, renaissance, largely, in, italy, the, violin, had, improved, in, volume, tone, and, agility, to, the, point, that, it, not, only, became, a, very, important, instrument, in, art, music, but, proved, highly, appealing, to, folk, musicians, as, well, ultimately, spreading, very, widely, sometimes, displacing, earlier, bowed, instruments, ethnomusicologists, have, observed, its, widespread, use, in, europe, asia, and, the, americas, when, played, as, a, folk, instrument, the, violin, is, usually, referred, to, in, english, as, a, fiddle, although, the, term, fiddle, can, be, used, informally, no, matter, what, the, genre, of, music, worldwide, there, are, various, stringed, instruments, such, as, the, wheel, fiddle, and, apache, fiddle, that, are, also, called, fiddles, fiddle, music, differs, from, classical, in, that, the, tunes, are, generally, considered, dance, music, and, various, techniques, such, as, droning, shuffling, and, ornamentation, specific, to, particular, styles, are, used, in, many, traditions, of, folk, music, the, tunes, are, not, written, but, are, memorized, by, successive, generations, of, musicians, and, passed, on, in, what, is, known, as, the, oral, tradition, many, old, time, pieces, call, for, cross, tuning, or, using, tunings, other, than, standard, gdae, some, players, of, american, styles, of, folk, fiddling, such, as, bluegrass, or, old, time, have, their, bridge, s, top, edge, cut, to, a, slightly, flatter, curve, making, techniques, such, as, a, double, shuffle, less, taxing, on, the, bow, arm, as, it, reduces, the, range, of, motion, needed, for, alternating, between, double, stops, on, different, string, pairs, fiddlers, who, use, solid, steel, core, strings, may, prefer, to, use, a, tailpiece, with, fine, tuners, on, all, four, strings, instead, of, the, single, fine, tuner, on, the, e, string, used, by, many, classical, players, as, well, as, the, arabic, rababah, the, violin, has, been, used, in, arabic, music, electric, violins, have, a, magnetic, or, piezoelectric, pickup, that, converts, string, vibration, to, an, electric, signal, a, patch, cable, or, wireless, transmitter, sends, the, signal, to, an, amplifier, of, a, pa, system, electric, violins, are, usually, constructed, as, such, but, a, pickup, can, be, added, to, a, conventional, acoustic, violin, an, electric, violin, with, a, resonating, body, that, produces, listening, level, sound, independently, of, the, electric, elements, can, be, called, an, electro, acoustic, violin, to, be, effective, as, an, acoustic, violin, electro, acoustic, violins, retain, much, of, the, resonating, body, of, the, violin, and, often, resemble, an, acoustic, violin, or, fiddle, the, body, may, be, finished, in, bright, colors, and, made, from, alternative, materials, to, wood, these, violins, may, need, to, be, hooked, up, to, an, instrument, amplifier, or, pa, system, some, types, come, with, a, silent, option, that, allows, the, player, to, use, headphones, that, are, hooked, up, to, the, violin, the, first, specially, built, electric, violins, date, back, to, 1928, and, were, made, by, victor, pfeil, oskar, vierling, george, eisenberg, benjamin, miessner, george, beauchamp, hugo, benioff, and, fredray, kislingbury, these, violins, can, be, plugged, into, effect, units, just, like, an, electric, guitar, including, distortion, wah, wah, pedal, and, reverb, since, electric, violins, do, not, rely, on, string, tension, and, resonance, to, amplify, their, sound, they, can, have, more, strings, for, example, five, stringed, electric, violins, are, available, from, several, manufacturers, and, a, seven, string, electric, violin, with, three, lower, strings, encompassing, the, cello, s, range, is, also, available, the, majority, of, the, first, electric, violinists, were, musicians, playing, jazz, fusion, e, g, jean, luc, ponty, and, popular, music, violin, authentication, is, the, process, of, determining, the, maker, and, manufacture, date, of, a, violin, this, can, be, an, important, process, as, significant, value, may, be, attached, to, violins, made, either, by, specific, makers, or, at, specific, times, and, locations, analysis, on, design, model, wood, characteristics, and, varnish, texture, can, be, used, to, authenticate, a, violin, forgery, and, other, methods, of, fraudulent, misrepresentation, can, be, used, to, inflate, the, value, of, an, instrument
