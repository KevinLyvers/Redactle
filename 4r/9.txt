spanning, over, three, thousand, years, ancient, egypt, was, not, one, stable, civilization, but, in, constant, change, and, upheaval, commonly, split, into, periods, by, historians, likewise, ancient, egyptian, architecture, is, not, one, style, but, a, set, of, styles, differing, over, time, but, with, some, commonalities, the, best, known, example, of, ancient, egyptian, architecture, are, the, egyptian, pyramids, and, sphinx, while, excavated, temples, palaces, tombs, and, fortresses, have, also, been, studied, most, buildings, were, built, of, locally, available, mud, brick, and, limestone, by, paid, laborers, and, craftsmen, monumental, buildings, were, built, using, the, post, and, lintel, method, of, construction, many, buildings, were, aligned, astronomically, columns, were, typically, adorned, with, capitals, decorated, to, resemble, plants, important, to, egyptian, civilization, such, as, the, papyrus, plant, ancient, egyptian, architectural, motifs, have, influenced, architecture, elsewhere, reaching, the, wider, world, first, during, the, orientalizing, period, and, again, during, the, nineteenth, century, egyptomania, due, to, the, scarcity, of, wood, the, two, predominant, building, materials, used, in, ancient, egypt, were, sun, baked, mud, brick, and, stone, mainly, limestone, but, also, sandstone, and, granite, in, considerable, quantities, from, the, old, kingdom, onward, stone, was, generally, reserved, for, tombs, and, temples, while, bricks, were, used, even, for, royal, palaces, fortresses, the, walls, of, temple, precincts, and, towns, and, for, subsidiary, buildings, in, temple, complexes, the, core, of, the, pyramids, consisted, of, locally, quarried, stone, mud, bricks, sand, or, gravel, for, the, casing, stones, were, used, that, had, to, be, transported, from, farther, away, predominantly, white, limestone, from, tura, and, red, granite, from, upper, egypt, ancient, egyptian, houses, were, made, out, of, mud, collected, from, the, damp, banks, of, the, nile, river, it, was, placed, in, moulds, and, left, to, dry, in, the, hot, sun, to, harden, for, use, in, construction, if, the, bricks, were, intended, to, be, used, in, a, royal, tomb, like, a, pyramid, the, exterior, bricks, would, also, be, finely, chiselled, and, polished, many, egyptian, towns, have, disappeared, because, they, were, situated, near, the, cultivated, area, of, the, nile, valley, and, were, flooded, as, the, river, bed, slowly, rose, during, the, millennia, or, the, mud, bricks, and, sun, dried, brick, of, which, they, were, built, were, used, by, peasants, as, fertilizer, others, are, inaccessible, new, buildings, having, been, erected, on, ancient, ones, however, the, dry, hot, climate, of, egypt, preserved, some, mud, brick, structures, examples, include, the, village, deir, al, madinah, the, middle, kingdom, town, at, kahun, and, the, fortresses, at, buhen, and, mirgissa, also, many, temples, and, tombs, have, survived, because, they, were, built, on, high, ground, unaffected, by, the, nile, flood, and, were, constructed, of, stone, thus, our, understanding, of, ancient, egyptian, architecture, is, based, mainly, on, religious, monuments, massive, structures, characterized, by, thick, sloping, walls, with, few, openings, possibly, echoing, a, method, of, construction, used, to, obtain, stability, in, mud, walls, in, a, similar, manner, the, incised, and, flatly, modeled, surface, adornment, of, the, stone, buildings, may, have, derived, from, mud, wall, ornamentation, although, the, use, of, the, arch, was, developed, during, the, fourth, dynasty, all, monumental, buildings, are, post, and, lintel, constructions, with, flat, roofs, constructed, of, huge, stone, blocks, supported, by, the, external, walls, and, the, closely, spaced, columns, exterior, and, interior, walls, as, well, as, the, columns, and, piers, were, covered, with, hieroglyphic, and, pictorial, frescoes, and, carvings, painted, in, brilliant, colors, many, motifs, of, egyptian, ornamentation, are, symbolic, such, as, the, scarab, or, sacred, beetle, the, solar, disk, and, the, vulture, other, common, motifs, include, palm, leaves, the, papyrus, plant, and, the, buds, and, flowers, of, the, lotus, hieroglyphs, were, inscribed, for, decorative, purposes, as, well, as, to, record, historic, events, or, spells, in, addition, these, pictorial, frescoes, and, carvings, allow, us, to, understand, how, the, ancient, egyptians, lived, statuses, wars, that, were, fought, and, their, beliefs, this, was, especially, true, in, recent, years, when, exploring, the, tombs, of, ancient, egyptian, officials, ancient, egyptian, temples, were, aligned, with, astronomically, significant, events, such, as, solstices, and, equinoxes, requiring, precise, measurements, at, the, moment, of, the, particular, event, measurements, at, the, most, significant, temples, may, have, been, ceremonially, undertaken, by, the, pharaoh, himself, as, early, as, 2600, bc, the, architect, imhotep, made, use, of, stone, columns, whose, surface, was, carved, to, reflect, the, organic, form, of, bundled, reeds, like, papyrus, lotus, and, palm, in, later, egyptian, architecture, faceted, cylinders, were, also, common, their, form, is, thought, to, derive, from, archaic, reed, built, shrines, carved, from, stone, the, columns, were, highly, decorated, with, carved, and, painted, hieroglyphs, texts, ritual, imagery, and, natural, motifs, egyptian, columns, are, famously, present, in, the, great, hypostyle, hall, of, karnak, c, 1224, bc, where, 134, columns, are, lined, up, in, 16, rows, with, some, columns, reaching, heights, of, 24, metres, one, of, the, most, important, type, are, the, papyriform, columns, the, origin, of, these, columns, goes, back, to, the, 5th, dynasty, they, are, composed, of, lotus, papyrus, stems, which, are, drawn, together, into, a, bundle, decorated, with, bands, the, capital, instead, of, opening, out, into, the, shape, of, a, bellflower, swells, out, and, then, narrows, again, like, a, flower, in, bud, the, base, which, tapers, to, take, the, shape, of, a, half, sphere, like, the, stem, of, the, lotus, has, a, continuously, recurring, decoration, of, stipules, at, the, luxor, temple, the, columns, are, reminiscent, of, papyrus, bundles, perhaps, symbolic, of, the, marsh, from, which, the, ancient, egyptians, believed, the, creation, of, the, world, to, have, unfolded, three, types, of, gardens, are, attested, from, ancient, egypt, temple, gardens, private, gardens, and, vegetable, gardens, some, temples, such, as, those, at, deir, el, bahri, were, provided, with, groves, and, trees, especially, the, sacred, ished, tree, persea, private, pleasure, gardens, are, known, from, an, 11th, dynasty, tomb, model, of, meketra, and, from, tomb, decoration, of, the, new, kingdom, they, were, typically, surrounded, by, a, high, wall, planted, with, trees, and, flowers, and, provided, with, shady, areas, plants, were, cultivated, for, fruits, and, fragrance, flowers, included, cornflowers, poppies, and, daisies, while, the, pomegranate, introduced, in, the, new, kingdom, became, a, popular, shrub, the, gardens, of, wealthier, individuals, were, arranged, around, an, ornamental, pool, for, fish, waterfowl, and, water, lilies, vegetable, plots, whether, privately, owned, or, belonging, to, temples, were, laid, out, in, squares, divided, by, water, channels, and, located, close, to, the, nile, they, were, irrigated, by, hand, or, from, the, late, 18th, dynasty, by, means, of, the, shaduf, mastabas, are, burial, tombs, that, hold, royal, significance, as, chosen, by, egyptian, rulers, many, of, the, tombs, found, throughout, time, were, located, along, the, nile, river, the, structural, exterior, regarding, mastabas, varies, throughout, history, but, there, is, a, noticeable, evolution, in, successive, egyptian, dynasties, the, mastabas, of, the, first, egyptian, dynasty, would, be, created, through, the, use, of, stepped, bricks, the, design, evolved, so, that, by, the, time, of, the, fourth, dynasty, the, structural, exterior, had, been, changed, from, brick, to, stone, the, reasoning, behind, the, stepped, designs, of, mastabas, is, connected, to, the, idea, of, accession, lateral, penetration, was, a, concern, in, when, constructing, tombs, in, order, to, prevent, damage, to, the, structure, brickwork, layers, were, placed, around, the, base, of, structure, mastabas, from, the, old, empire, took, on, a, pyramidal, design, structure, this, design, was, largely, reserved, for, rulers, such, as, the, king, and, his, family, as, a, means, for, burial, other, design, characteristics, regarding, mastabas, from, the, old, kingdom, include, having, rectangular, outlines, walls, that, were, slanted, the, use, of, stone, and, brick, materials, and, having, the, axis, of, the, structure, run, north, south, multiple, elements, make, up, the, interior, of, a, mastaba, such, as, an, offering, chamber, statues, for, the, dead, and, a, vault, beneath, which, held, the, sarcophagus, by, the, end, of, the, old, kingdom, the, use, of, these, tombs, had, been, abandoned, the, oldest, monumental, stone, structure, of, egypt, is, the, stepped, pyramid, of, djoser, at, saqqara, c, 2650, bc, attributed, to, the, architect, imhotep, this, funerary, monument, marks, the, origin, of, pyramid, tombs, and, is, the, earliest, form, of, monumental, architecture, in, history, its, design, transformed, the, simple, flat, mastaba, tomb, into, an, elevated, structure, by, replicating, it, in, additional, levels, stacked, one, on, top, of, the, other, each, smaller, than, the, one, below, resulting, in, a, stepped, profile, this, achievement, also, marked, the, new, importance, of, worked, stone, as, a, building, material, the, main, period, of, pyramid, construction, began, around, 2640, bc, with, the, reign, of, snefru, who, initiated, the, construction, of, multiple, pyramids, that, experimented, with, new, designs, his, first, two, pyramids, at, meidum, were, of, the, stepped, kind, with, its, roots, in, the, earlier, third, dynasty, period, and, saqqara, this, was, followed, by, a, major, innovation, the, creation, of, the, first, true, pyramid, with, straight, surfaces, instead, of, stepped, levels, forming, a, pure, geometric, form, the, first, attempt, was, what, later, became, known, as, the, bent, pyramid, so, called, because, part, way, through, its, construction, the, angle, of, its, sides, was, reduced, when, the, structure, s, weight, threatened, its, collapse, the, second, successful, attempt, was, what, became, known, as, the, red, pyramid, both, are, located, at, dahshur, in, addition, to, the, form, of, the, pyramid, this, period, also, saw, innovations, in, the, layout, of, tomb, chambers, and, refinements, in, decorative, techniques, the, giza, necropolis, stands, on, the, giza, plateau, on, the, outskirts, of, cairo, egypt, this, complex, of, ancient, monuments, is, located, some, 8, kilometers, 5, 0, miles, inland, into, the, desert, from, the, old, town, of, giza, on, the, nile, some, 20, kilometers, 12, miles, southwest, of, cairo, city, center, this, ancient, egyptian, necropolis, consists, of, the, pyramid, of, khufu, also, known, as, the, great, pyramid, or, the, pyramid, of, cheops, the, somewhat, smaller, pyramid, of, khafre, or, kephren, chefren, and, the, relatively, modest, sized, pyramid, of, menkaure, or, mykerinus, mycerinus, along, with, a, number, of, smaller, satellite, edifices, known, as, queens, pyramids, the, great, sphinx, as, well, as, a, few, hundred, mastabas, and, chapels, the, pyramids, which, were, built, in, the, fourth, dynasty, testify, to, the, power, of, the, pharaonic, religion, and, state, they, were, built, to, serve, both, as, grave, sites, and, also, as, a, way, to, make, their, names, last, forever, the, size, and, simple, design, show, the, high, skill, level, of, egyptian, design, and, engineering, on, a, large, scale, the, great, pyramid, of, giza, which, was, probably, completed, c, 2580, bc, is, the, oldest, of, the, giza, pyramids, and, the, largest, pyramid, in, the, world, and, is, the, only, surviving, monument, of, the, seven, wonders, of, the, ancient, world, the, pyramid, of, khafre, is, believed, to, have, been, completed, around, 2532, bc, at, the, end, of, khafre, s, reign, khafre, ambitiously, placed, his, pyramid, next, to, his, father, s, it, is, not, as, tall, as, his, father, s, pyramid, but, he, was, able, to, give, it, the, impression, of, appearing, taller, by, building, it, on, a, site, with, a, foundation, 33, feet, 10, m, higher, than, his, father, s, along, with, building, his, pyramid, chefren, commissioned, the, sculpting, of, the, giant, sphinx, as, guardian, over, his, tomb, the, face, of, a, human, possibly, a, depiction, of, the, pharaoh, on, a, lion, s, body, was, seen, as, a, symbol, of, divinity, among, the, greeks, fifteen, hundred, years, later, the, great, sphinx, is, carved, out, of, the, limestone, bedrock, and, stands, about, 65, feet, 20, m, tall, menkaure, s, pyramid, dates, to, circa, 2490, bc, and, stands, 213, feet, 65, m, high, making, it, the, smallest, of, the, great, pyramids, popular, culture, leads, people, to, believe, that, pyramids, are, highly, confusing, with, many, tunnels, within, the, pyramid, to, create, confusion, for, grave, robbers, this, is, not, true, the, shafts, of, pyramids, are, quite, simple, mostly, leading, directly, to, the, tomb, the, immense, size, of, the, pyramids, attracted, robbers, to, the, wealth, that, lay, inside, which, caused, the, tombs, to, be, robbed, relatively, soon, after, they, were, sealed, in, some, cases, the, luxor, temple, is, a, huge, ancient, egyptian, temple, complex, located, on, the, east, bank, of, the, river, nile, in, the, city, today, known, as, luxor, ancient, thebes, construction, work, on, the, temple, began, during, the, reign, of, amenhotep, iii, in, the, 14th, century, bc, during, the, new, kingdom, horemheb, and, tutankhamun, added, columns, statues, and, friezes, and, akhenaten, had, earlier, obliterated, his, father, s, cartouches, and, installed, a, shrine, to, the, aten, but, the, only, major, expansion, effort, took, place, under, ramesses, ii, some, 100, years, after, the, first, stones, were, put, in, place, luxor, is, thus, unique, among, the, main, egyptian, temple, complexes, in, having, only, two, pharaohs, leave, their, mark, on, its, architectural, structure, the, temple, proper, begins, with, the, 24, m, 79, ft, high, first, pylon, built, by, ramesses, ii, the, pylon, was, decorated, with, scenes, of, ramesses, s, military, triumphs, particularly, the, battle, of, qadesh, later, pharaohs, particularly, those, of, the, kushite, dynasty, also, recorded, their, victories, there, this, main, entrance, to, the, temple, complex, was, originally, flanked, by, six, colossal, statues, of, ramesses, four, seated, and, two, standing, but, only, two, both, seated, have, survived, modern, visitors, can, also, see, a, 25, m, 82, ft, tall, pink, granite, obelisk, this, one, of, a, matching, pair, until, 1835, when, the, other, one, was, taken, to, paris, where, it, now, stands, in, the, centre, of, the, place, de, la, concorde, through, the, pylon, gateway, leads, into, a, peristyle, courtyard, also, built, by, ramesses, ii, this, area, and, the, pylon, were, built, at, an, oblique, angle, to, the, rest, of, the, temple, presumably, to, accommodate, the, three, pre, existing, barque, shrines, located, in, the, northwest, corner, after, the, peristyle, courtyard, comes, the, processional, colonnade, built, by, amenhotep, iii, a, 100, m, 330, ft, corridor, lined, by, 14, papyrus, capital, columns, friezes, on, the, wall, describe, the, stages, in, the, opet, festival, from, sacrifices, at, karnak, at, the, top, left, through, amun, s, arrival, at, luxor, at, the, end, of, that, wall, and, concluding, with, his, return, on, the, opposite, side, the, decorations, were, put, in, place, by, tutankhamun, the, boy, pharaoh, is, depicted, but, his, names, have, been, replaced, with, those, of, horemheb, beyond, the, colonnade, is, a, peristyle, courtyard, which, also, dates, back, to, amenhotep, s, original, construction, the, best, preserved, columns, are, on, the, eastern, side, where, some, traces, of, original, color, can, be, seen, the, southern, side, of, this, courtyard, is, made, up, of, a, 36, column, hypostyle, court, i, e, a, roofed, space, supported, by, columns, that, leads, into, the, dark, inner, rooms, of, the, temple, the, temple, complex, of, karnak, is, located, on, the, banks, of, the, nile, river, some, 2, 5, kilometers, 1, 6, miles, north, of, luxor, it, consists, of, four, main, parts, precinct, of, amon, re, the, precinct, of, montu, the, precinct, of, mut, and, the, temple, of, amenhotep, iv, dismantled, as, well, as, a, few, smaller, temples, and, sanctuaries, located, outside, the, enclosing, walls, of, the, four, main, parts, and, several, avenues, of, ram, headed, sphinxes, connecting, the, precinct, of, mut, the, precinct, of, amon, re, and, luxor, temple, this, temple, complex, is, particularly, significant, for, many, rulers, notably, every, ruler, of, the, new, kingdom, have, added, to, it, the, site, covers, over, 80, hectares, 200, acres, and, consists, of, a, series, of, pylons, leading, into, courtyards, halls, chapels, obelisks, and, smaller, temples, the, key, difference, between, karnak, and, most, of, the, other, temples, and, sites, in, egypt, is, the, length, of, time, over, which, it, was, developed, and, used, construction, work, began, in, the, 16th, century, bc, and, was, originally, quite, modest, in, size, but, eventually, in, the, main, precinct, alone, as, many, as, twenty, temples, and, chapels, would, be, constructed, approximately, 30, pharaohs, contributed, to, the, buildings, enabling, it, to, reach, a, size, complexity, and, diversity, not, seen, elsewhere, few, of, the, individual, features, of, karnak, are, unique, but, the, size, and, number, of, those, features, are, overwhelming, one, of, the, greatest, temples, in, egyptian, history, is, that, of, amun, ra, at, karnak, as, with, many, other, temples, in, egypt, this, one, honors, the, gods, and, details, the, feats, of, the, past, including, thousands, of, years, of, history, depicted, by, inscriptions, on, many, of, the, walls, and, columns, found, on, site, often, modified, or, completely, erased, and, redone, by, following, rulers, the, temple, of, amun, re, was, constructed, in, three, sections, the, third, being, constructed, by, late, new, kingdom, pharaohs, in, canon, with, the, traditional, style, of, egyptian, architecture, many, of, the, architectural, features, such, as, the, inner, sanctum, of, the, complex, were, aligned, with, the, sunset, of, the, summer, solstice, one, of, the, architectural, features, present, at, the, site, is, the, 5, 000, sq, m, 50, 000, sq, ft, hypostyle, hall, built, during, the, ramesside, period, the, hall, is, supported, by, approximately, 139, sandstone, and, mud, brick, columns, with, 12, central, columns, 25, meters, 82, feet, tall, that, would, have, all, been, brightly, painted, ramesses, ii, a, 19th, dynasty, pharaoh, ruled, egypt, from, around, 1279, to, 1213, bce, among, his, many, accomplishments, such, as, the, expansion, of, egypt, s, borders, he, constructed, a, massive, temple, called, the, ramesseum, located, near, thebes, then, the, capital, of, the, new, kingdom, the, ramesseum, was, a, magnificent, temple, complete, with, monumental, statues, to, guard, its, entrance, the, most, impressive, was, a, statue, of, ramses, himself, originally, 19, metres, 62, ft, tall, and, approximately, 1, 000, tons, the, base, and, torso, are, all, that, remain, of, this, impressive, statue, of, the, enthroned, pharaoh, the, temple, features, impressive, reliefs, many, detailing, a, number, of, ramses, military, victories, such, as, the, battle, of, kadesh, ca, 1274, bce, and, the, pillaging, of, the, city, of, shalem, the, ramesseum, was, built, to, be, a, place, of, worship, for, ramesses, ii, although, there, are, only, traces, left, of, its, former, structure, the, ramesseum, was, not, only, a, temple, but, it, included, a, palace, too, the, ramesseum, was, more, than, those, however, not, only, was, it, a, place, of, worship, but, it, also, had, other, rooms, used, for, catering, to, the, needs, of, the, people, such, as, bakeries, kitchens, and, supply, rooms, which, were, found, in, the, southern, part, of, the, temple, during, an, excavation, there, was, also, a, school, where, boys, were, taught, to, become, scribes, which, was, located, in, the, area, between, the, kitchen, and, palace, there, were, other, burials, that, were, built, in, the, ramesseum, after, it, was, ruined, as, well, the, ramesseum, was, originally, built, for, ramesses, ii, but, after, it, was, ruined, the, ramesseum, was, given, to, certain, families, of, the, 22nd, dynasty, who, then, placed, the, second, burials, in, the, chambers, and, used, it, as, a, cemetery, of, sort, there, have, been, many, restorations, done, to, the, ramesseum, as, well, with, one, being, the, installation, of, a, ramesses, ii, s, colossus, head, on, a, plinth, and, bracing, it, after, it, was, found, lying, on, the, ground, another, was, for, areas, that, were, made, out, of, mud, bricks, these, areas, were, restored, by, covering, them, with, modern, bricks, that, were, made, of, the, same, material, but, are, stronger, than, the, mud, bricks, so, they, would, be, able, to, hold, against, natural, elements, such, as, torrential, rain, under, the, tenure, of, amenhotep, iii, workers, constructed, over, 250, buildings, and, monuments, one, of, the, most, impressive, building, projects, was, the, temple, complex, of, malkata, known, among, the, ancient, egyptians, as, the, house, of, rejoicing, was, constructed, to, serve, his, royal, residence, on, the, west, bank, of, thebes, just, south, of, the, theban, necropolis, the, site, is, approximately, 226, 000, square, meters, or, 2, 432, 643, square, feet, given, the, immense, size, of, the, site, along, with, its, many, buildings, courts, parade, grounds, and, housing, it, is, considered, to, have, served, not, just, as, a, temple, and, dwelling, of, the, pharaoh, but, a, town, the, central, area, of, the, complex, consisted, in, the, pharaoh, s, apartments, that, were, made, up, of, a, number, of, rooms, and, courts, all, of, which, were, oriented, around, a, columned, banquet, hall, accompanying, the, apartments, that, presumably, housed, the, royal, cohort, and, foreign, guests, was, a, large, throne, room, connected, to, smaller, chambers, for, storage, waiting, and, smaller, audiences, the, greater, elements, of, this, area, of, the, complex, are, what, have, been, come, to, be, called, the, west, villas, just, west, of, the, king, s, palace, the, north, palace, and, village, and, temple, the, temple, s, external, dimensions, are, approximately, 183, 5, by, 110, 5, m, and, consists, of, two, parts, the, large, forecourt, and, the, temple, proper, the, large, front, court, is, 131, 5, by, 105, 5, m, oriented, on, the, east, west, axis, and, occupies, the, east, part, of, the, temple, complex, the, western, part, of, the, court, is, on, a, higher, level, and, is, divided, from, the, rest, of, the, court, by, a, low, retaining, wall, the, lower, court, is, almost, square, whereas, the, upper, terrace, was, rectangular, in, shape, the, upper, section, of, the, court, was, paved, with, mud, bricks, and, has, a, 4, m, wide, entrance, to, it, from, the, lower, part, of, the, fore, court, connecting, the, base, to, the, upper, landing, was, a, ramp, enclosed, by, walls, this, ramp, and, entrance, were, both, at, the, center, of, the, temple, with, the, same, orientation, as, the, front, court, entrance, and, the, temple, proper, the, temple, proper, might, be, seen, as, divided, in, to, three, distinct, parts, central, north, and, south, the, central, part, is, indicated, by, a, small, rectangular, anteroom, 6, 5, by, 3, 5, m, many, of, the, door, jambs, including, those, of, the, antechamber, include, inscriptions, such, as, given, life, like, ra, forever, a, 12, 5, by, 14, 5, m, hall, follows, the, anteroom, from, which, is, entered, via, a, 3, 5, m, wide, door, in, the, center, of, the, front, wall, of, the, hall, there, is, evidence, the, ceiling, of, this, chamber, was, decorated, with, yellow, stars, on, blue, background, whereas, the, walls, today, show, only, the, appearance, of, a, white, stucco, over, mud, plaster, notwithstanding, we, might, speculate, given, the, numerous, decorative, plaster, fragments, found, within, the, room, s, deposit, that, these, too, were, ornately, decorated, with, various, images, and, patterns, supporting, the, ceiling, are, six, columns, arranged, in, two, rows, with, east, west, axis, only, small, fragments, of, the, column, bases, have, survived, though, they, suggest, the, diameter, of, these, columns, to, have, been, about, 2, 25, m, the, columns, are, placed, 2, 5, m, away, from, the, walls, and, in, each, row, the, columns, are, approximately, 1, 4, m, away, from, the, next, while, the, space, between, the, two, rows, is, 3, m, a, second, hall, 12, 5, by, 10, m, is, accessed, by, a, 3, m, door, at, the, center, of, the, back, wall, of, the, first, the, second, hall, is, similar, to, the, first, first, its, ceiling, seems, to, have, been, decorated, with, similar, if, not, identical, patterns, and, images, as, the, first, second, in, the, same, way, the, ceiling, is, supported, by, columns, four, to, be, precise, ordered, in, two, rows, on, the, same, axis, as, those, of, the, first, hall, with, a, 3, m, wide, space, between, them, in, hall, two, at, least, one, of, the, rooms, appears, to, have, been, dedicated, to, the, cult, of, maat, which, suggests, the, other, three, in, this, area, might, have, likewise, served, such, a, religious, purpose, the, southern, part, of, the, temple, may, be, divided, into, two, sections, western, and, southern, the, western, section, consists, of, 6, rooms, whereas, the, southern, area, given, its, size, 19, 5, by, 17, 2, m, suggests, it, might, have, served, as, another, open, court, in, many, of, these, rooms, were, found, blue, ceramic, tiles, inlaid, with, gold, around, their, edge, the, northern, part, of, the, temple, proper, consists, of, ten, rooms, similar, in, style, to, those, of, the, southern, the, temple, itself, seems, to, have, been, dedicated, to, the, egyptian, deity, amun, given, the, number, of, bricks, stamped, with, various, inscriptions, such, as, the, temple, of, amun, in, the, house, of, rejoicing, or, nebmaarta, in, the, temple, of, amun, in, the, house, of, rejoicing, overall, the, temple, of, malakata, shares, many, with, other, cult, temples, of, the, new, kingdom, with, magnificent, halls, and, religiously, oriented, rooms, with, many, others, more, closely, resemble, store, rooms, while, the, new, kingdom, continued, the, tradition, of, establishing, a, funerary, cult, for, deceased, pharaohs, in, dedicated, monumental, temples, the, pharaohs, themselves, were, no, longer, buried, in, large, highly, visible, monuments, like, the, ancient, pyramids, both, the, old, kingdom, and, middle, kingdom, funerary, monuments, were, plundered, and, thus, had, failed, to, protect, the, bodies, of, the, pharaohs, in, their, afterlife, starting, with, the, eighteenth, dynasty, the, pharaohs, were, instead, buried, in, hidden, underground, tombs, inside, the, valley, of, the, kings, near, thebes, these, tombs, were, excavated, directly, into, the, rock, of, the, valley, slopes, their, precise, layouts, varied, over, time, but, they, generally, involved, a, corridor, organized, into, multiple, sections, leading, to, a, tomb, chamber, initially, only, the, burial, chamber, was, decorated, but, eventually, the, walls, of, the, entire, tomb, were, richly, decorated, with, illustrations, and, texts, during, the, greco, roman, period, of, egypt, 332, bc, 395, ad, when, egypt, was, ruled, by, the, greek, ptolemaic, dynasty, and, then, the, roman, empire, egyptian, architecture, underwent, significant, changes, due, to, the, influence, of, greek, architecture, although, the, rulers, were, new, they, maintained, a, strong, respect, for, native, egyptian, religion, and, built, many, new, temples, or, expanded, old, ones, the, capital, of, the, country, was, moved, to, the, recently, founded, city, of, alexandria, on, the, shores, of, the, mediterranean, its, plan, was, largely, that, of, a, greek, city, with, local, elements, mixed, in, most, of, the, city, has, disappeared, under, the, water, or, under, the, modern, city, today, but, it, was, known, from, descriptions, to, contain, many, great, buildings, including, a, royal, palace, the, musaeum, the, library, of, alexandria, and, the, famous, pharos, lighthouse, many, well, preserved, temples, in, upper, egypt, date, from, this, era, such, as, the, temple, of, edfu, the, temple, of, kom, ombo, and, the, philae, temple, complex, while, temple, architecture, remained, more, traditionally, egyptian, new, greco, roman, influences, are, evident, such, as, the, appearance, of, composite, capitals, egyptian, motifs, also, made, their, way, into, wider, greek, and, roman, architecture, much, of, the, period, s, funerary, architecture, has, not, survived, though, some, of, alexandria, s, underground, catacombs, shared, by, the, city, s, inhabitants, to, bury, their, dead, have, been, preserved, they, feature, a, hybrid, architectural, style, in, which, both, classical, and, egyptian, decoration, are, mixed, together, the, catacombs, of, kom, el, shoqafa, begun, in, the, 1st, century, ad, and, continuously, enlarged, until, the, 3rd, century, are, one, notable, example, and, can, be, visited, today, fortifications, within, ancient, egypt, were, built, in, times, of, conflict, between, rival, principalities, out, of, all, fortresses, analyzed, within, this, time, frame, most, if, not, all, were, built, of, the, same, materials, the, only, exception, to, the, rule, were, some, fortresses, from, the, old, kingdom, as, fortresses, such, as, the, fort, of, buhen, utilized, stone, with, the, creation, of, its, walls, the, main, walls, were, mainly, built, with, mud, brick, but, were, reinforced, with, other, materials, such, as, timber, rocks, were, also, utilized, to, not, only, preserve, them, from, erosion, as, well, as, paving, secondary, walls, would, be, built, outside, of, fortresses, main, walls, and, were, relatively, close, to, one, another, as, a, result, this, would, prove, to, be, a, challenge, to, invaders, as, they, were, forced, to, destroy, this, fortification, before, they, could, reach, the, main, walls, of, the, fort, another, strategy, was, utilized, if, the, enemy, managed, to, break, through, the, first, barrier, upon, making, it, to, the, main, wall, a, ditch, would, be, constructed, that, would, be, positioned, between, the, secondary, and, first, walls, the, purpose, of, this, was, to, place, the, enemy, in, a, position, that, would, leave, them, exposed, to, the, enemy, making, the, invaders, susceptible, to, arrow, fire, the, position, of, this, ditch, walls, within, the, interior, of, fortresses, would, become, demilitarized, during, times, of, unity, leading, to, them, being, demolished, the, parts, that, were, used, to, construct, said, walls, could, then, be, reused, making, the, overall, design, extremely, beneficial, fortresses, within, ancient, egypt, held, multiple, functions, during, the, middle, kingdom, period, the, twelfth, dynasty, of, egypt, would, establish, means, of, control, throughout, the, nubian, riverside, by, creating, fortified, stations, the, location, of, egyptian, fortresses, were, not, exclusive, to, just, the, riverside, sites, within, both, egypt, and, nubia, would, be, placed, on, terrain, that, was, either, rocky, or, sandy, the, purpose, behind, this, method, was, to, spread, its, influence, throughout, the, region, as, well, as, discourage, rival, groups, from, raiding, the, sites, inspections, of, these, forts, in, nubia, have, led, to, the, discovery, of, copper, smelting, materials, which, suggest, a, relationship, with, miners, in, the, region, the, occupation, of, these, nubian, forts, suggests, a, trade, relationship, between, the, two, parties, miners, would, collect, the, materials, and, would, transfer, them, to, these, forts, in, exchange, for, food, and, water, up, until, the, thirteenth, dynasty, egypt, would, maintain, control, of, nubia, through, the, use, of, these, fortresses, the, pelusium, fortress, served, as, means, of, protection, for, the, nile, delta, from, invaders, while, the, site, served, this, role, for, more, than, a, millennium, pelusium, was, also, known, for, being, a, center, of, trade, both, land, and, maritime, trade, was, primarily, conducted, between, egypt, and, the, levant, while, information, is, not, concrete, in, terms, of, the, fortress, s, establishment, it, is, suggested, that, pelusium, was, erected, during, either, the, middle, kingdom, period, or, during, the, saite, and, persian, periods, from, the, 8th, to, 6th, century, bc, pelusium, is, also, seen, as, an, integral, part, of, the, nile, as, other, ruins, were, found, outside, its, borders, indicating, that, the, area, was, large, in, occupation, architecturally, structures, of, pelusium, such, as, its, gates, and, towers, appear, to, be, built, from, limestone, a, metallurgy, industry, is, also, indicated, to, have, taken, place, at, this, site, due, to, the, discovery, of, copper, ore, excavations, of, the, site, have, also, discovered, older, materials, that, date, back, to, some, of, the, early, dynasties, and, include, basalt, granite, diorite, marble, and, quartzite, these, materials, may, however, have, been, of, more, recent, origin, the, fortress, was, constructed, in, close, proximity, to, the, nile, river, and, was, largely, surrounded, by, both, dunes, and, coastlines, there, are, multiple, reasons, that, caused, the, decline, of, the, pelusium, fortress, during, its, existence, events, such, as, the, bubonic, plague, appeared, in, the, mediterranean, for, the, first, time, and, multiple, fires, within, the, fortress, occurred, conquest, by, the, persians, as, well, as, a, decrease, in, trade, also, may, have, led, to, an, increase, in, abandonment, officially, natural, reasons, are, what, led, to, pelusium, falling, apart, such, as, tectonic, motions, the, official, desertion, of, the, site, is, attributed, to, the, time, of, the, crusades, jaffa, fortress, was, prominent, during, the, new, kingdom, period, of, egypt, it, served, as, both, a, fortress, and, a, port, on, the, mediterranean, coast, to, this, day, jaffa, serves, as, a, primary, israeli, port, originally, under, the, control, of, the, canaanites, the, site, fell, under, the, control, of, the, egyptian, empire, during, the, late, bronze, age, the, site, was, successfully, used, as, a, base, for, campaigns, of, 18th, dynasty, pharaohs, in, terms, of, its, functions, the, site, held, multiple, roles, it, is, suggested, that, jaffa, s, primary, function, was, to, serve, as, a, granary, for, the, egyptian, army, rameses, gate, which, is, dated, to, the, late, bronze, age, serves, as, a, connection, to, the, fortress, ramparts, were, also, discovered, with, the, fortress, upon, excavation, the, site, hosted, multiple, items, such, as, bowls, imported, jars, pot, stands, and, beer, and, bread, which, further, emphasizes, the, importance, of, these, items, to, the, area, the, discovery, of, these, objects, show, a, close, connection, between, the, storing, of, food, and, the, creation, of, ceramic, items, after, the, advent, of, roman, rule, some, temples, were, also, repurposed, for, new, uses, the, luxor, temple, for, example, became, the, center, of, a, roman, military, camp, and, parts, of, the, temple, were, dedicated, to, the, worship, of, the, divine, emperor, the, southern, part, of, the, temple, was, later, transformed, into, a, christian, church, and, the, mosque, of, abu, haggag, was, attached, to, the, east, side, of, the, temple, during, the, islamic, period, stones, and, architectural, elements, from, ancient, egyptian, monuments, were, often, used, as, spolia, for, later, constructions, a, number, of, medieval, mosques, for, example, incorporate, ancient, stone, blocks, with, still, visible, hieroglyphic, carvings, as, early, as, the, roman, period, and, as, late, as, the, 19th, century, many, ancient, egyptian, obelisks, were, also, reappropriated, and, transported, to, other, countries, where, they, were, often, re, erected, as, prized, monuments, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, egyptian, architectural, motifs, were, used, for, modern, architecture, giving, rise, to, egyptian, revival, architecture, and, later, particularly, egyptian, theater, cinemas, and, other, themed, entertainment, places
