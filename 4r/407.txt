https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messiah_(Handel)
messiah, hwv, 56, is, an, english, language, oratorio, composed, in, 1741, by, george, frideric, handel, the, text, was, compiled, from, the, king, james, bible, and, the, coverdale, psalter, by, charles, jennens, it, was, first, performed, in, dublin, on, 13, april, 1742, and, received, its, london, premiere, a, year, later, after, an, initially, modest, public, reception, the, oratorio, gained, in, popularity, eventually, becoming, one, of, the, best, known, and, most, frequently, performed, choral, works, in, western, music, handel, s, reputation, in, england, where, he, had, lived, since, 1712, had, been, established, through, his, compositions, of, italian, opera, he, turned, to, english, oratorio, in, the, 1730s, in, response, to, changes, in, public, taste, messiah, was, his, sixth, work, in, this, genre, although, its, structure, resembles, that, of, opera, it, is, not, in, dramatic, form, there, are, no, impersonations, of, characters, and, no, direct, speech, instead, jennens, s, text, is, an, extended, reflection, on, jesus, as, the, messiah, called, christ, the, text, begins, in, part, i, with, prophecies, by, isaiah, and, others, and, moves, to, the, annunciation, to, the, shepherds, the, only, scene, taken, from, the, gospels, in, part, ii, handel, concentrates, on, the, passion, of, jesus, and, ends, with, the, hallelujah, chorus, in, part, iii, he, covers, paul, s, teachings, on, the, resurrection, of, the, dead, and, christ, s, glorification, in, heaven, handel, wrote, messiah, for, modest, vocal, and, instrumental, forces, with, optional, alternate, settings, for, many, of, the, individual, numbers, in, the, years, after, his, death, the, work, was, adapted, for, performance, on, a, much, larger, scale, with, giant, orchestras, and, choirs, in, other, efforts, to, update, it, its, orchestration, was, revised, and, amplified, such, as, mozart, s, der, messias, in, the, late, 20th, and, early, 21st, centuries, the, trend, has, been, towards, reproducing, a, greater, fidelity, to, handel, s, original, intentions, although, big, messiah, productions, continue, to, be, mounted, a, near, complete, version, was, issued, on, 78, rpm, discs, in, 1928, since, then, the, work, has, been, recorded, many, times, the, autograph, manuscript, of, the, oratorio, is, preserved, in, the, british, library, the, composer, george, frideric, handel, born, in, halle, in, brandenburg, prussia, modern, germany, in, 1685, took, up, permanent, residence, in, london, in, 1712, and, became, a, naturalised, british, subject, in, 1727, by, 1741, his, pre, eminence, in, british, music, was, evident, from, the, honours, he, had, accumulated, including, a, pension, from, the, court, of, king, george, ii, the, office, of, composer, of, musick, for, the, chapel, royal, and, most, unusually, for, a, living, person, a, statue, erected, in, his, honour, in, vauxhall, gardens, within, a, large, and, varied, musical, output, handel, was, a, vigorous, champion, of, italian, opera, which, he, had, introduced, to, london, in, 1711, with, rinaldo, he, subsequently, wrote, and, presented, more, than, 40, such, operas, in, london, s, theatres, by, the, early, 1730s, public, taste, for, italian, opera, was, beginning, to, fade, the, popular, success, of, john, gay, and, johann, christoph, pepusch, s, the, beggar, s, opera, first, performed, in, 1728, had, heralded, a, spate, of, english, language, ballad, operas, that, mocked, the, pretensions, of, italian, opera, with, box, office, receipts, falling, handel, s, productions, were, increasingly, reliant, on, private, subsidies, from, the, nobility, such, funding, became, harder, to, obtain, after, the, launch, in, 1730, of, the, opera, of, the, nobility, a, rival, company, to, his, own, handel, overcame, this, challenge, but, he, spent, large, sums, of, his, own, money, in, doing, so, although, prospects, for, italian, opera, were, declining, handel, remained, committed, to, the, genre, but, as, alternatives, to, his, staged, works, he, began, to, introduce, english, language, oratorios, in, rome, in, 1707, 08, he, had, written, two, italian, oratorios, at, a, time, when, opera, performances, in, the, city, were, temporarily, forbidden, under, papal, decree, his, first, venture, into, english, oratorio, had, been, esther, which, was, written, and, performed, for, a, private, patron, in, about, 1718, in, 1732, handel, brought, a, revised, and, expanded, version, of, esther, to, the, king, s, theatre, haymarket, where, members, of, the, royal, family, attended, a, glittering, premiere, on, 6, may, its, success, encouraged, handel, to, write, two, more, oratorios, deborah, and, athalia, all, three, oratorios, were, performed, to, large, and, appreciative, audiences, at, the, sheldonian, theatre, in, oxford, in, mid, 1733, undergraduates, reportedly, sold, their, furniture, to, raise, the, money, for, the, five, shilling, tickets, in, 1735, handel, received, the, text, for, a, new, oratorio, named, saul, from, its, librettist, charles, jennens, a, wealthy, landowner, with, musical, and, literary, interests, because, handel, s, main, creative, concern, was, still, with, opera, he, did, not, write, the, music, for, saul, until, 1738, in, preparation, for, his, 1738, 39, theatrical, season, the, work, after, opening, at, the, king, s, theatre, in, january, 1739, to, a, warm, reception, was, quickly, followed, by, the, less, successful, oratorio, israel, in, egypt, which, may, also, have, come, from, jennens, although, handel, continued, to, write, operas, the, trend, towards, english, language, productions, became, irresistible, as, the, decade, ended, after, three, performances, of, his, last, italian, opera, deidamia, in, january, and, february, 1741, he, abandoned, the, genre, in, july, 1741, jennens, sent, him, a, new, libretto, for, an, oratorio, in, a, letter, dated, 10, july, to, his, friend, edward, holdsworth, jennens, wrote, i, hope, will, lay, out, his, whole, genius, skill, upon, it, that, the, composition, may, excell, all, his, former, compositions, as, the, subject, excells, every, other, subject, the, subject, is, messiah, in, christian, theology, the, messiah, is, the, saviour, of, humankind, the, messiah, m, a, is, an, old, testament, hebrew, word, meaning, the, anointed, one, which, in, new, testament, greek, is, christ, a, title, given, to, jesus, of, nazareth, known, by, his, followers, as, jesus, christ, handel, s, messiah, has, been, described, by, the, early, music, scholar, richard, luckett, as, a, commentary, on, nativity, passion, resurrection, and, ascension, beginning, with, god, s, promises, as, spoken, by, the, prophets, and, ending, with, christ, s, glorification, in, heaven, in, contrast, with, most, of, handel, s, oratorios, the, singers, in, messiah, do, not, assume, dramatic, roles, there, is, no, single, dominant, narrative, voice, and, very, little, use, is, made, of, quoted, speech, in, his, libretto, jennens, s, intention, was, not, to, dramatise, the, life, and, teachings, of, jesus, but, to, acclaim, the, mystery, of, godliness, using, a, compilation, of, extracts, from, the, authorized, king, james, version, of, the, bible, and, from, the, psalms, included, in, the, 1662, book, of, common, prayer, the, three, part, structure, of, the, work, approximates, to, that, of, handel, s, three, act, operas, with, the, parts, subdivided, by, jennens, into, scenes, each, scene, is, a, collection, of, individual, numbers, or, movements, which, take, the, form, of, recitatives, arias, and, choruses, there, are, two, instrumental, numbers, the, opening, sinfony, in, the, style, of, a, french, overture, and, the, pastoral, pifa, often, called, the, pastoral, symphony, at, the, mid, point, of, part, i, in, part, i, the, messiah, s, coming, and, the, virgin, birth, are, predicted, by, the, old, testament, prophets, the, annunciation, to, the, shepherds, of, the, birth, of, the, christ, is, represented, in, the, words, of, luke, s, gospel, part, ii, covers, christ, s, passion, and, his, death, his, resurrection, and, ascension, the, first, spreading, of, the, gospel, through, the, world, and, a, definitive, statement, of, god, s, glory, summarised, in, the, hallelujah, part, iii, begins, with, the, promise, of, redemption, followed, by, a, prediction, of, the, day, of, judgment, and, the, general, resurrection, ending, with, the, final, victory, over, sin, and, death, and, the, acclamation, of, christ, according, to, the, musicologist, donald, burrows, much, of, the, text, is, so, allusive, as, to, be, largely, incomprehensible, to, those, ignorant, of, the, biblical, accounts, for, the, benefit, of, his, audiences, jennens, printed, and, issued, a, pamphlet, explaining, the, reasons, for, his, choices, of, scriptural, selections, charles, jennens, was, born, around, 1700, into, a, prosperous, landowning, family, whose, lands, and, properties, in, warwickshire, and, leicestershire, he, eventually, inherited, his, religious, and, political, views, he, opposed, the, act, of, settlement, of, 1701, which, secured, the, accession, to, the, british, throne, for, the, house, of, hanover, prevented, him, from, receiving, his, degree, from, balliol, college, oxford, or, from, pursuing, any, form, of, public, career, his, family, s, wealth, enabled, him, to, live, a, life, of, leisure, while, devoting, himself, to, his, literary, and, musical, interests, although, musicologist, watkins, shaw, dismisses, jennens, as, a, conceited, figure, of, no, special, ability, burrows, has, written, of, jennens, s, musical, literacy, there, can, be, no, doubt, he, was, certainly, devoted, to, handel, s, music, having, helped, to, finance, the, publication, of, every, handel, score, since, rodelinda, in, 1725, by, 1741, after, their, collaboration, on, saul, a, warm, friendship, had, developed, between, the, two, and, handel, was, a, frequent, visitor, to, the, jennens, family, estate, at, gopsall, jennens, s, letter, to, holdsworth, of, 10, july, 1741, in, which, he, first, mentions, messiah, suggests, that, the, text, was, a, recent, work, probably, assembled, earlier, that, summer, as, a, devout, anglican, and, believer, in, scriptural, authority, jennens, intended, to, challenge, advocates, of, deism, who, rejected, the, doctrine, of, divine, intervention, in, human, affairs, shaw, describes, the, text, as, a, meditation, of, our, lord, as, messiah, in, christian, thought, and, belief, and, despite, his, reservations, on, jennens, s, character, concedes, that, the, finished, wordbook, amounts, to, little, short, of, a, work, of, genius, there, is, no, evidence, that, handel, played, any, active, role, in, the, selection, or, preparation, of, the, text, such, as, he, did, in, the, case, of, saul, it, seems, rather, that, he, saw, no, need, to, make, any, significant, amendment, to, jennens, s, work, the, music, for, messiah, was, completed, in, 24, days, of, swift, composition, having, received, jennens, s, text, some, time, after, 10, july, 1741, handel, began, work, on, it, on, 22, august, his, records, show, that, he, had, completed, part, i, in, outline, by, 28, august, part, ii, by, 6, september, and, part, iii, by, 12, september, followed, by, two, days, of, filling, up, to, produce, the, finished, work, on, 14, september, this, rapid, pace, was, seen, by, jennens, not, as, a, sign, of, ecstatic, energy, but, rather, as, careless, negligence, and, the, relations, between, the, two, men, would, remain, strained, since, jennens, urged, handel, to, make, improvements, while, the, composer, stubbornly, refused, the, autograph, score, s, 259, pages, show, some, signs, of, haste, such, as, blots, scratchings, out, unfilled, bars, and, other, uncorrected, errors, but, according, to, the, music, scholar, richard, luckett, the, number, of, errors, is, remarkably, small, in, a, document, of, this, length, the, original, manuscript, for, messiah, is, now, held, in, the, british, library, s, music, collection, it, is, scored, for, two, trumpets, timpani, two, oboes, two, violins, viola, and, basso, continuo, at, the, end, of, his, manuscript, handel, wrote, the, letters, sdg, soli, deo, gloria, to, god, alone, the, glory, this, inscription, taken, with, the, speed, of, composition, has, encouraged, belief, in, the, apocryphal, story, that, handel, wrote, the, music, in, a, fervour, of, divine, inspiration, in, which, as, he, wrote, the, hallelujah, chorus, he, saw, all, heaven, before, him, burrows, points, out, that, many, of, handel, s, operas, of, comparable, length, and, structure, to, messiah, were, composed, within, similar, timescales, between, theatrical, seasons, the, effort, of, writing, so, much, music, in, so, short, a, time, was, not, unusual, for, handel, and, his, contemporaries, handel, commenced, his, next, oratorio, samson, within, a, week, of, finishing, messiah, and, completed, his, draft, of, this, new, work, in, a, month, in, accordance, with, his, practice, when, writing, new, works, handel, adapted, existing, compositions, for, use, in, messiah, in, this, case, drawing, on, two, recently, completed, italian, duets, and, one, written, twenty, years, previously, thus, se, tu, non, lasci, amore, hwv, 193, from, 1722, became, the, basis, of, o, death, where, is, thy, sting, his, yoke, is, easy, and, and, he, shall, purify, were, drawn, from, quel, fior, che, all, alba, ride, hwv, 192, july, 1741, unto, us, a, child, is, born, and, all, we, like, sheep, from, n, di, voi, non, vo, fidarmi, hwv, 189, july, 1741, handel, s, instrumentation, in, the, score, is, often, imprecise, again, in, line, with, contemporary, convention, where, the, use, of, certain, instruments, and, combinations, was, assumed, and, did, not, need, to, be, written, down, by, the, composer, later, copyists, would, fill, in, the, details, before, the, first, performance, handel, made, numerous, revisions, to, his, manuscript, score, in, part, to, match, the, forces, available, for, the, 1742, dublin, premiere, it, is, probable, that, his, work, was, not, performed, as, originally, conceived, in, his, lifetime, between, 1742, and, 1754, he, continued, to, revise, and, recompose, individual, movements, sometimes, to, suit, the, requirements, of, particular, singers, the, first, published, score, of, messiah, was, issued, in, 1767, eight, years, after, handel, s, death, though, this, was, based, on, relatively, early, manuscripts, and, included, none, of, handel, s, later, revisions, handel, s, decision, to, give, a, season, of, concerts, in, dublin, in, the, winter, of, 1741, 42, arose, from, an, invitation, from, the, duke, of, devonshire, then, serving, as, lord, lieutenant, of, ireland, a, violinist, friend, of, handel, s, matthew, dubourg, was, in, dublin, as, the, lord, lieutenant, s, bandmaster, he, would, look, after, the, tour, s, orchestral, requirements, whether, handel, originally, intended, to, perform, messiah, in, dublin, is, uncertain, he, did, not, inform, jennens, of, any, such, plan, for, the, latter, wrote, to, holdsworth, on, 2, december, 1741, it, was, some, mortification, to, me, to, hear, that, instead, of, performing, messiah, here, he, has, gone, into, ireland, with, it, after, arriving, in, dublin, on, 18, november, 1741, handel, arranged, a, subscription, series, of, six, concerts, to, be, held, between, december, 1741, and, february, 1742, at, the, great, music, hall, fishamble, street, the, venue, had, been, built, in, 1741, specifically, to, accommodate, concerts, for, the, benefit, of, the, charitable, and, musical, society, for, the, release, of, imprisoned, debtors, a, charity, for, whom, handel, had, agreed, to, perform, one, benefit, performance, these, concerts, were, so, popular, that, a, second, series, was, quickly, arranged, messiah, figured, in, neither, series, in, early, march, handel, began, discussions, with, the, appropriate, committees, for, a, charity, concert, to, be, given, in, april, at, which, he, intended, to, present, messiah, he, sought, and, was, given, permission, from, st, patrick, s, and, christ, church, cathedrals, to, use, their, choirs, for, this, occasion, these, forces, amounted, to, sixteen, men, and, sixteen, boy, choristers, several, of, the, men, were, allocated, solo, parts, the, women, soloists, were, christina, maria, avoglio, who, had, sung, the, main, soprano, roles, in, the, two, subscription, series, and, susannah, cibber, an, established, stage, actress, and, contralto, who, had, sung, in, the, second, series, to, accommodate, cibber, s, vocal, range, the, recitative, then, shall, the, eyes, of, the, blind, and, the, aria, he, shall, feed, his, flock, were, transposed, down, to, f, major, the, performance, also, in, the, fishamble, street, hall, was, originally, announced, for, 12, april, but, was, deferred, for, a, day, at, the, request, of, persons, of, distinction, the, orchestra, in, dublin, comprised, strings, two, trumpets, and, timpani, the, number, of, players, is, unknown, handel, had, his, own, organ, shipped, to, ireland, for, the, performances, a, harpsichord, was, probably, also, used, the, three, charities, that, were, to, benefit, were, prisoners, debt, relief, the, mercer, s, hospital, and, the, charitable, infirmary, in, its, report, on, a, public, rehearsal, the, dublin, news, letter, described, the, oratorio, as, far, surpass, anything, of, that, nature, which, has, been, performed, in, this, or, any, other, kingdom, seven, hundred, people, attended, the, premiere, on, 13, april, so, that, the, largest, possible, audience, could, be, admitted, to, the, concert, gentlemen, were, requested, to, remove, their, swords, and, ladies, were, asked, not, to, wear, hoops, in, their, dresses, the, performance, earned, unanimous, praise, from, the, assembled, press, words, are, wanting, to, express, the, exquisite, delight, it, afforded, to, the, admiring, and, crouded, audience, a, dublin, clergyman, rev, delaney, was, so, overcome, by, susanna, cibber, s, rendering, of, he, was, despised, that, reportedly, he, leapt, to, his, feet, and, cried, woman, for, this, be, all, thy, sins, forgiven, thee, the, takings, amounted, to, around, 400, providing, about, 127, to, each, of, the, three, nominated, charities, and, securing, the, release, of, 142, indebted, prisoners, handel, remained, in, dublin, for, four, months, after, the, premi, re, he, organised, a, second, performance, of, messiah, on, 3, june, which, was, announced, as, the, last, performance, of, mr, handel, s, during, his, stay, in, this, kingdom, in, this, second, messiah, which, was, for, handel, s, private, financial, benefit, cibber, reprised, her, role, from, the, first, performance, though, avoglio, may, have, been, replaced, by, a, mrs, maclaine, details, of, other, performers, are, not, recorded, the, warm, reception, accorded, to, messiah, in, dublin, was, not, repeated, in, london, indeed, even, the, announcement, of, the, performance, as, a, new, sacred, oratorio, drew, an, anonymous, commentator, to, ask, if, the, playhouse, is, a, fit, temple, to, perform, it, handel, introduced, the, work, at, the, covent, garden, theatre, on, 23, march, 1743, avoglio, and, cibber, were, again, the, chief, soloists, they, were, joined, by, the, tenor, john, beard, a, veteran, of, handel, s, operas, the, bass, thomas, rheinhold, and, two, other, sopranos, kitty, clive, and, miss, edwards, the, first, performance, was, overshadowed, by, views, expressed, in, the, press, that, the, work, s, subject, matter, was, too, exalted, to, be, performed, in, a, theatre, particularly, by, secular, singer, actresses, such, as, cibber, and, clive, in, an, attempt, to, deflect, such, sensibilities, in, london, handel, had, avoided, the, name, messiah, and, presented, the, work, as, the, new, sacred, oratorio, as, was, his, custom, handel, rearranged, the, music, to, suit, his, singers, he, wrote, a, new, setting, of, and, lo, the, angel, of, the, lord, for, clive, never, used, subsequently, he, added, a, tenor, song, for, beard, their, sound, is, gone, out, which, had, appeared, in, jennens, s, original, libretto, but, had, not, been, in, the, dublin, performances, the, custom, of, standing, for, the, hallelujah, chorus, originates, from, a, popular, belief, that, at, the, london, premiere, king, george, ii, did, so, which, would, have, obliged, all, to, stand, there, is, no, convincing, evidence, that, the, king, was, present, or, that, he, attended, any, subsequent, performance, of, messiah, the, first, reference, to, the, practice, of, standing, appears, in, a, letter, dated, 1756, three, years, prior, to, handel, s, death, london, s, initially, cool, reception, of, messiah, led, handel, to, reduce, the, season, s, planned, six, performances, to, three, and, not, to, present, the, work, at, all, in, 1744, to, the, considerable, annoyance, of, jennens, whose, relations, with, the, composer, temporarily, soured, at, jennens, s, request, handel, made, several, changes, in, the, music, for, the, 1745, revival, their, sound, is, gone, out, became, a, choral, piece, the, soprano, song, rejoice, greatly, was, recomposed, in, shortened, form, and, the, transpositions, for, cibber, s, voice, were, restored, to, their, original, soprano, range, jennens, wrote, to, holdsworth, on, 30, august, 1745, has, made, a, fine, entertainment, of, it, though, not, near, so, good, as, he, might, ought, to, have, done, i, have, with, great, difficulty, made, him, correct, some, of, the, grosser, faults, in, the, composition, handel, directed, two, performances, at, covent, garden, in, 1745, on, 9, and, 11, april, and, then, set, the, work, aside, for, four, years, the, 1749, revival, at, covent, garden, under, the, proper, title, of, messiah, saw, the, appearance, of, two, female, soloists, who, were, henceforth, closely, associated, with, handel, s, music, giulia, frasi, and, caterina, galli, in, the, following, year, these, were, joined, by, the, male, alto, gaetano, guadagni, for, whom, handel, composed, new, versions, of, but, who, may, abide, and, thou, art, gone, up, on, high, the, year, 1750, also, saw, the, institution, of, the, annual, charity, performances, of, messiah, at, london, s, foundling, hospital, which, continued, until, handel, s, death, and, beyond, the, 1754, performance, at, the, hospital, is, the, first, for, which, full, details, of, the, orchestral, and, vocal, forces, survive, the, orchestra, included, fifteen, violins, five, violas, three, cellos, two, double, basses, four, bassoons, four, oboes, two, trumpets, two, horns, and, drums, in, the, chorus, of, nineteen, were, six, trebles, from, the, chapel, royal, the, remainder, all, men, were, altos, tenors, and, basses, frasi, galli, and, beard, led, the, five, soloists, who, were, required, to, assist, the, chorus, for, this, performance, the, transposed, guadagni, arias, were, restored, to, the, soprano, voice, by, 1754, handel, was, severely, afflicted, by, the, onset, of, blindness, and, in, 1755, he, turned, over, the, direction, of, the, messiah, hospital, performance, to, his, pupil, j, c, smith, he, apparently, resumed, his, duties, in, 1757, and, may, have, continued, thereafter, the, final, performance, of, the, work, at, which, handel, was, present, was, at, covent, garden, on, 6, april, 1759, eight, days, before, his, death, during, the, 1750s, messiah, was, performed, increasingly, at, festivals, and, cathedrals, throughout, the, country, individual, choruses, and, arias, were, occasionally, extracted, for, use, as, anthems, or, motets, in, church, services, or, as, concert, pieces, a, practice, that, grew, in, the, 19th, century, and, has, continued, ever, since, after, handel, s, death, performances, were, given, in, florence, 1768, new, york, excerpts, 1770, hamburg, 1772, and, mannheim, 1777, where, mozart, first, heard, it, for, the, performances, in, handel, s, lifetime, and, in, the, decades, following, his, death, the, musical, forces, used, in, the, foundling, hospital, performance, of, 1754, are, thought, by, burrows, to, be, typical, a, fashion, for, large, scale, performances, began,

the, band, consisting, of, dxxv, vocal, instrumental, performers, was, conducted, by, joah, bates, esqr, in, a, 1955, article, sir, malcolm, sargent, a, proponent, of, large, scale, performances,

and, three, pairs, of, timpani, some, made, especially, large, in, 1787, further, performances, were, given, at, the, abbey, advertisements, promised, the, band, will, consist, of, eight, hundred, performers, in, continental, europe, performances, of, messiah, were, departing, from, handel, s, practices, in, a, different, way, his, score, was, being, drastically, reorchestrated, to, suit, contemporary, tastes, in, 1786, johann, adam, hiller, presented, messiah, with, updated, scoring, in, berlin, cathedral, in, 1788, hiller, presented, a, performance, of, his, revision, with, a, choir, of, 259, and, an, orchestra, of, 87, strings, 10, bassoons, 11, oboes, 8, flutes, 8, horns, 4, clarinets, 4, trombones, 7, trumpets, timpani, harpsichord, and, organ, in, 1789, mozart, was, commissioned, by, baron, gottfried, van, swieten, and, the, gesellschaft, der, associierten, to, re, orchestrate, several, works, by, handel, including, messiah, der, messias, writing, for, a, small, scale, performance, he, eliminated, the, organ, continuo, added, parts, for, flutes, clarinets, trombones, and, horns, recomposed, some, passages, and, rearranged, others, the, performance, took, place, on, 6, march, 1789, in, the, rooms, of, count, johann, esterh, zy, with, four, soloists, and, a, choir, of, 12, mozart, s, arrangement, with, minor, amendments, from, hiller, was, published, in, 1803, after, his, death, the, musical, scholar, moritz, hauptmann, described, the, mozart, additions, as, stucco, ornaments, on, a, marble, temple, mozart, himself, was, reportedly, circumspect, about, his, changes, insisting, that, any, alterations, to, handel, s, score, should, not, be, interpreted, as, an, effort, to, improve, the, music, elements, of, this, version, later, became, familiar, to, british, audiences, incorporated, into, editions, of, the, score, by, editors, including, ebenezer, prout, in, the, 19th, century, approaches, to, handel, in, german, and, english, speaking, countries, diverged, further, in, leipzig, in, 1856, the, musicologist, friedrich, chrysander, and, the, literary, historian, georg, gottfried, gervinus, founded, the, deutsche, h, ndel, gesellschaft, with, the, aim, of, publishing, authentic, editions, of, all, handel, s, works, at, the, same, time, performances, in, britain, and, the, united, states, moved, away, from, handel, s, performance, practice, with, increasingly, grandiose, renditions, messiah, was, presented, in, new, york, in, 1853, with, a, chorus, of, 300, and, in, boston, in, 1865, with, more, than, 600, in, britain, a, great, handel, festival, was, held, at, the, crystal, palace, in, 1857, performing, messiah, and, other, handel, oratorios, with, a, chorus, of, 2, 000, singers, and, an, orchestra, of, 500, in, the, 1860s, and, 1870s, ever, larger, forces, were, assembled, bernard, shaw, in, his, role, as, a, music, critic, commented, the, stale, wonderment, which, the, great, chorus, never, fails, to, elicit, has, already, been, exhausted, he, later, wrote, why, instead, of, wasting, huge, sums, on, the, multitudinous, dullness, of, a, handel, festival, does, not, somebody, set, up, a, thoroughly, rehearsed, and, exhaustively, studied, performance, of, the, messiah, in, st, james, s, hall, with, a, chorus, of, twenty, capable, artists, most, of, us, would, be, glad, to, hear, the, work, seriously, performed, once, before, we, die, the, employment, of, huge, forces, necessitated, considerable, augmentation, of, the, orchestral, parts, many, admirers, of, handel, believed, that, the, composer, would, have, made, such, additions, had, the, appropriate, instruments, been, available, in, his, day, shaw, argued, largely, unheeded, that, the, composer, may, be, spared, from, his, friends, and, the, function, of, writing, or, selecting, additional, orchestral, accompaniments, exercised, with, due, discretion, one, reason, for, the, popularity, of, huge, scale, performances, was, the, ubiquity, of, amateur, choral, societies, the, conductor, sir, thomas, beecham, wrote, that, for, 200, years, the, chorus, was, the, national, medium, of, musical, utterance, in, britain, however, after, the, heyday, of, victorian, choral, societies, he, noted, a, rapid, and, violent, reaction, against, monumental, performances, an, appeal, from, several, quarters, that, handel, should, be, played, and, heard, as, in, the, days, between, 1700, and, 1750, at, the, end, of, the, century, sir, frederick, bridge, and, t, w, bourne, pioneered, revivals, of, messiah, in, handel, s, orchestration, and, bourne, s, work, was, the, basis, for, further, scholarly, versions, in, the, early, 20th, century, although, the, huge, scale, oratorio, tradition, was, perpetuated, by, such, large, ensembles, as, the, royal, choral, society, the, tabernacle, choir, and, the, huddersfield, choral, society, in, the, 20th, century, there, were, increasing, calls, for, performances, more, faithful, to, handel, s, conception, at, the, turn, of, the, century, the, musical, times, wrote, of, the, additional, accompaniments, of, mozart, and, others, is, it, not, time, that, some, of, these, hangers, on, of, handel, s, score, were, sent, about, their, business, in, 1902, prout, produced, a, new, edition, of, the, score, working, from, handel, s, original, manuscripts, rather, than, from, corrupt, printed, versions, with, errors, accumulated, from, one, edition, to, another, however, prout, started, from, the, assumption, that, a, faithful, reproduction, of, handel, s, original, score, would, not, be, practical, he, attempts, made, from, time, to, time, by, our, musical, societies, to, give, handel, s, music, as, he, meant, it, to, be, given, must, however, earnest, the, intention, and, however, careful, the, preparation, be, foredoomed, to, failure, from, the, very, nature, of, the, case, with, our, large, choral, societies, additional, accompaniments, of, some, kind, are, a, necessity, for, an, effective, performance, and, the, question, is, not, so, much, whether, as, how, they, are, to, be, written, prout, continued, the, practice, of, adding, flutes, clarinets, and, trombones, to, handel, s, orchestration, but, he, restored, handel, s, high, trumpet, parts, which, mozart, had, omitted, evidently, because, playing, them, was, a, lost, art, by, 1789, there, was, little, dissent, from, prout, s, approach, and, when, chrysander, s, scholarly, edition, was, published, in, the, same, year, it, was, received, respectfully, as, a, volume, for, the, study, rather, than, a, performing, edition, being, an, edited, reproduction, of, various, of, handel, s, manuscript, versions, an, authentic, performance, was, thought, impossible, the, musical, times, correspondent, wrote, handel, s, orchestral, instruments, were, all, excepting, the, trumpet, of, a, coarser, quality, than, those, at, present, in, use, his, harpsichords, are, gone, for, ever, the, places, in, which, he, performed, the, messiah, were, mere, drawing, rooms, when, compared, with, the, albert, hall, the, queen, s, hall, and, the, crystal, palace, in, australia, the, register, protested, at, the, prospect, of, performances, by, trumpery, little, church, choirs, of, 20, voices, or, so, in, germany, messiah, was, not, so, often, performed, as, in, britain, when, it, was, given, medium, sized, forces, were, the, norm, at, the, handel, festival, held, in, 1922, in, handel, s, native, town, halle, his, choral, works, were, given, by, a, choir, of, 163, and, an, orchestra, of, 64, in, britain, innovative, broadcasting, and, recording, contributed, to, reconsideration, of, handelian, performance, for, example, in, 1928, beecham, conducted, a, recording, of, messiah, with, modestly, sized, forces, and, controversially, brisk, tempi, although, the, orchestration, remained, far, from, authentic, in, 1934, and, 1935, the, bbc, broadcast, performances, of, messiah, conducted, by, adrian, boult, with, a, faithful, adherence, to, handel, s, clear, scoring, a, performance, with, authentic, scoring, was, given, in, worcester, cathedral, as, part, of, the, three, choirs, festival, in, 1935, in, 1950, john, tobin, conducted, a, performance, of, messiah, in, st, paul, s, cathedral, with, the, orchestral, forces, specified, by, the, composer, a, choir, of, 60, a, countertenor, alto, soloist, and, modest, attempts, at, vocal, elaboration, of, the, printed, notes, in, the, manner, of, handel, s, day, the, prout, version, sung, with, many, voices, remained, popular, with, british, choral, societies, but, at, the, same, time, increasingly, frequent, performances, were, given, by, small, professional, ensembles, in, suitably, sized, venues, using, authentic, scoring, recordings, on, lp, and, cd, were, preponderantly, of, the, latter, type, and, the, large, scale, messiah, came, to, seem, old, fashioned, the, cause, of, authentic, performance, was, advanced, in, 1965, by, the, publication, of, a, new, edition, of, the, score, edited, by, watkins, shaw, in, the, grove, dictionary, of, music, and, musicians, david, scott, writes, the, edition, at, first, aroused, suspicion, on, account, of, its, attempts, in, several, directions, to, break, the, crust, of, convention, surrounding, the, work, in, the, british, isles, by, the, time, of, shaw, s, death, in, 1996, the, times, described, his, edition, as, now, in, universal, use, messiah, remains, handel, s, best, known, work, with, performances, particularly, popular, during, the, advent, season, writing, in, december, 1993, the, music, critic, alex, ross, refers, to, that, month, s, 21, performances, in, new, york, alone, as, numbing, repetition, against, the, general, trend, towards, authenticity, the, work, has, been, staged, in, opera, houses, both, in, london, 2009, and, in, paris, 2011, the, mozart, score, is, revived, from, time, to, time, and, in, anglophone, countries, singalong, performances, with, many, hundreds, of, performers, are, popular, although, performances, striving, for, authenticity, are, now, usual, it, is, generally, agreed, that, there, can, never, be, a, definitive, version, of, messiah, the, surviving, manuscripts, contain, radically, different, settings, of, many, numbers, and, vocal, and, instrumental, ornamentation, of, the, written, notes, is, a, matter, of, personal, judgment, even, for, the, most, historically, informed, performers, the, handel, scholar, winton, dean, has, written, here, is, still, plenty, for, scholars, to, fight, over, and, more, than, ever, for, conductors, to, decide, for, themselves, indeed, if, they, are, not, prepared, to, grapple, with, the, problems, presented, by, the, score, they, ought, not, to, conduct, it, this, applies, not, only, to, the, choice, of, versions, but, to, every, aspect, of, baroque, practice, and, of, course, there, are, often, no, final, answers, the, numbering, of, the, movements, shown, here, is, in, accordance, with, the, novello, vocal, score, 1959, edited, by, watkins, shaw, which, adapts, the, numbering, earlier, devised, by, ebenezer, prout, other, editions, count, the, movements, slightly, differently, the, b, renreiter, edition, of, 1965, for, example, does, not, number, all, the, recitatives, and, runs, from, 1, to, 47, the, division, into, parts, and, scenes, is, based, upon, the, 1743, word, book, prepared, for, the, first, london, performance, the, scene, headings, are, given, as, burrows, summarised, the, scene, headings, by, jennens, scene, 1, isaiah, s, prophecy, of, salvation, scene, 2, the, coming, judgment, scene, 3, the, prophecy, of, christ, s, birth, scene, 4, the, annunciation, to, the, shepherds, scene, 5,

judgment, scene, 3, the, final, conquest, of, sin, scene, 4, the, acclamation, of, the, messiah, handel, s, music, for, messiah, is, distinguished, from, most, of, his, other, oratorios, by, an, orchestral, restraint, a, quality, which, the, musicologist, percy, m, young, observes, was, not, adopted, by, mozart, and, other, later, arrangers, of, the, music, the, work, begins, quietly, with, instrumental, and, solo, movements, preceding, the, first, appearance, of, the, chorus, whose, entry, in, the, low, alto, register, is, muted, a, particular, aspect, of, handel, s, restraint, is, his, limited, use, of, trumpets, throughout, the, work, after, their, introduction, in, the, part, i, chorus, glory, to, god, apart, from, the, solo, in, the, trumpet, shall, sound, they, are, heard, only, in, hallelujah, and, the, final, chorus, worthy, is, the, lamb, it, is, this, rarity, says, young, that, makes, these, brass, interpolations, particularly, effective, increase, them, and, the, thrill, is, diminished, in, glory, to, god, handel, marked, the, entry, of, the, trumpets, as, da, lontano, e, un, poco, piano, meaning, quietly, from, afar, his, original, intention, had, been, to, place, the, brass, offstage, in, disparte, at, this, point, to, highlight, the, effect, of, distance, in, this, initial, appearance, the, trumpets, lack, the, expected, drum, accompaniment, a, deliberate, withholding, of, effect, leaving, something, in, reserve, for, parts, ii, and, iii, according, to, luckett, although, messiah, is, not, in, any, particular, key, handel, s, tonal, scheme, has, been, summarised, by, the, musicologist, anthony, hicks, as, an, aspiration, towards, d, major, the, key, musically, associated, with, light, and, glory, as, the, oratorio, moves, forward, with, various, shifts, in, key, to, reflect, changes, in, mood, d, major, emerges, at, significant, points, primarily, the, trumpet, movements, with, their, uplifting, messages, it, is, the, key, in, which, the, work, reaches, its, triumphant, ending, in, the, absence, of, a, predominant, key, other, integrating, elements, have, been, proposed, for, example, the, musicologist, rudolf, steglich, has, suggested, that, handel, used, the, device, of, the, ascending, fourth, as, a, unifying, motif, this, device, most, noticeably, occurs, in, the, first, two, notes, of, i, know, that, my, redeemer, liveth, and, on, numerous, other, occasions, nevertheless, luckett, finds, this, thesis, implausible, and, asserts, that, the, unity, of, messiah, is, a, consequence, of, nothing, more, arcane, than, the, quality, of, handel, s, attention, to, his, text, and, the, consistency, of, his, musical, imagination, allan, kozinn, the, new, york, times, music, critic, finds, a, model, marriage, of, music, and, text, from, the, gentle, falling, melody, assigned, to, the, opening, words, comfort, ye, to, the, sheer, ebullience, of, the, hallelujah, chorus, and, the, ornate, celebratory, counterpoint, that, supports, the, closing, amen, hardly, a, line, of, text, goes, by, that, handel, does, not, amplify, the, opening, sinfony, is, composed, in, e, minor, for, strings, and, is, handel, s, first, use, in, oratorio, of, the, french, overture, form, jennens, commented, that, the, sinfony, contains, passages, far, unworthy, of, handel, but, much, more, unworthy, of, the, messiah, handel, s, early, biographer, charles, burney, merely, found, it, dry, and, uninteresting, a, change, of, key, to, e, major, leads, to, the, first, prophecy, delivered, by, the, tenor, whose, vocal, line, in, the, opening, recitative, comfort, ye, is, entirely, independent, of, the, strings, accompaniment, the, music, proceeds, through, various, key, changes, as, the, prophecies, unfold, culminating, in, the, g, major, chorus, for, unto, us, a, child, is, born, in, which, the, choral, exclamations, which, include, an, ascending, fourth, in, the, mighty, god, are, imposed, on, material, drawn, from, handel, s, italian, cantata, n, di, voi, non, vo, fidarmi, such, passages, says, the, music, historian, donald, jay, grout, reveal, handel, the, dramatist, the, unerring, master, of, dramatic, effect, the, pastoral, interlude, that, follows, begins, with, the, short, instrumental, movement, the, pifa, which, takes, its, name, from, the, shepherd, bagpipers, or, pifferari, who, played, their, pipes, in, the, streets, of, rome, at, christmas, time, handel, wrote, the, movement, in, both, 11, bar, and, extended, 32, bar, forms, according, to, burrows, either, will, work, in, performance, the, group, of, four, short, recitatives, which, follow, it, introduce, the, soprano, soloist, although, often, the, earlier, aria, but, who, may, abide, is, sung, by, the, soprano, in, its, transposed, g, minor, form, the, final, recitative, of, this, section, is, in, d, major, and, heralds, the, affirmative, chorus, glory, to, god, the, remainder, of, part, i, is, largely, carried, by, the, soprano, in, b, flat, in, what, burrows, terms, a, rare, instance, of, tonal, stability, the, aria, he, shall, feed, his, flock, underwent, several, transformations, by, handel, appearing, at, different, times, as, a, recitative, an, alto, aria, and, a, duet, for, alto, and, soprano, before, the, original, soprano, version, was, restored, in, 1754, the, appropriateness, of, the, italian, source, material, for, the, setting, of, the, solemn, concluding, chorus, his, yoke, is, easy, has, been, questioned, by, the, music, scholar, sedley, taylor, who, calls, it, a, piece, of, word, painting, grievously, out, of, place, though, he, concedes, that, the, four, part, choral, conclusion, is, a, stroke, of, genius, that, combines, beauty, with, dignity, the, second, part, begins, in, g, minor, a, key, which, in, hogwood, s, phrase, brings, a, mood, of, tragic, presentiment, to, the, long, sequence, of, passion, numbers, which, follows, the, declamatory, opening, chorus, behold, the, lamb, of, god, in, fugal, form, is, followed, by, the, alto, solo, he, was, despised, in, e, flat, major, the, longest, single, item, in, the, oratorio, in, which, some, phrases, are, sung, unaccompanied, to, emphasise, christ, s, abandonment, luckett, records, burney, s, description, of, this, number, as, the, highest, idea, of, excellence, in, pathetic, expression, of, any, english, song, the, subsequent, series, of, mainly, short, choral, movements, cover, christ, s, passion, crucifixion, death, and, resurrection, at, first, in, f, minor, with, a, brief, f, major, respite, in, all, we, like, sheep, here, handel, s, use, of, n, di, voi, non, vo, fidarmi, has, sedley, taylor, s, unqualified, approval, bids, the, voices, enter, in, solemn, canonical, sequence, and, his, chorus, ends, with, a, combination, of, grandeur, and, depth, of, feeling, such, as, is, at, the, command, of, consummate, genius, only, the, sense, of, desolation, returns, in, what, hogwood, calls, the, remote, and, barbarous, key, of, b, flat, minor, for, the, tenor, recitative, all, they, that, see, him, the, sombre, sequence, finally, ends, with, the, ascension, chorus, lift, up, your, heads, which, handel, initially, divides, between, two, choral, groups, the, altos, serving, both, as, the, bass, line, to, a, soprano, choir, and, the, treble, line, to, the, tenors, and, basses, for, the, 1754, foundling, hospital, performance, handel, added, two, horns, which, join, in, when, the, chorus, unites, towards, the, end, of, the, number, after, the, celebratory, tone, of, christ, s, reception, into, heaven, marked, by, the, choir, s, d, major, acclamation, let, all, the, angels, of, god, worship, him, the, whitsun, section, proceeds, through, a, series, of, contrasting, moods, serene, and, pastoral, in, how, beautiful, are, the, feet, theatrically, operatic, in, why, do, the, nations, so, furiously, rage, towards, the, part, ii, culmination, of, hallelujah, the, hallelujah, chorus, as, young, points, out, is, not, the, climactic, chorus, of, the, work, although, one, cannot, escape, its, contagious, enthusiasm, it, builds, from, a, deceptively, light, orchestral, opening, through, a, short, unison, cantus, firmus, passage, on, the, words, for, the, lord, god, omnipotent, reigneth, the, theme, based, on, the, fugue, theme, from, corelli, s, fuga, a, quattro, voci, to, the, reappearance, of, the, long, silent, trumpets, at, and, he, shall, reign, for, ever, and, ever, commentators, have, noted, that, the, musical, line, for, this, third, subject, is, based, on, wachet, auf, philipp, nicolai, s, popular, lutheran, chorale, the, opening, soprano, solo, in, e, major, i, know, that, my, redeemer, liveth, is, one, of, the, few, numbers, in, the, oratorio, that, has, remained, unrevised, from, its, original, form, its, simple, unison, violin, accompaniment, and, its, consoling, rhythms, apparently, brought, tears, to, burney, s, eyes, it, is, followed, by, a, quiet, chorus, that, leads, to, the, bass, s, declamation, in, d, major, behold, i, tell, you, a, mystery, then, the, long, aria, the, trumpet, shall, sound, marked, pomposo, ma, non, allegro, dignified, but, not, fast, handel, originally, wrote, this, in, da, capo, form, but, shortened, it, to, dal, segno, probably, before, the, first, performance, the, extended, characteristic, trumpet, tune, that, precedes, and, accompanies, the, voice, is, the, only, significant, instrumental, solo, in, the, entire, oratorio, handel, s, awkward, repeated, stressing, of, the, fourth, syllable, of, incorruptible, may, have, been, the, source, of, the, 18th, century, poet, william, shenstone, s, comment, that, he, could, observe, some, parts, in, messiah, wherein, handel, s, judgements, failed, him, where, the, music, was, not, equal, or, was, even, opposite, to, what, the, words, required, after, a, brief, solo, recitative, the, alto, is, joined, by, the, tenor, for, the, only, duet, in, handel, s, final, version, of, the, music, o, death, where, is, thy, sting, the, melody, is, adapted, from, handel, s, 1722, cantata, se, tu, non, lasci, amore, and, is, in, luckett, s, view, the, most, successful, of, the, italian, borrowings, the, duet, runs, straight, into, the, chorus, but, thanks, be, to, god, the, reflective, soprano, solo, if, god, be, for, us, originally, written, for, alto, quotes, luther, s, chorale, aus, tiefer, not, it, ushers, in, the, d, major, choral, finale, worthy, is, the, lamb, leading, to, the, apocalyptic, amen, in, which, says, hogwood, the, entry, of, the, trumpets, marks, the, final, storming, of, heaven, handel, s, first, biographer, john, mainwaring, wrote, in, 1760, that, this, conclusion, revealed, the, composer, rising, still, higher, than, in, that, vast, effort, of, genius, the, hallelujah, chorus, young, writes, that, the, amen, should, in, the, manner, of, palestrina, be, delivered, as, though, through, the, aisles, and, ambulatories, of, some, great, church, many, early, recordings, of, individual, choruses, and, arias, from, messiah, reflect, the, performance, styles, then, fashionable, large, forces, slow, tempi, and, liberal, reorchestration, typical, examples, are, choruses, conducted, by, sir, henry, wood, recorded, in, 1926, for, columbia, with, the, 3, 500, strong, choir, and, orchestra, of, the, crystal, palace, handel, festival, and, a, contemporary, rival, disc, from, hmv, featuring, the, royal, choral, society, under, sargent, recorded, at, the, royal, albert, hall, the, first, near, complete, recording, of, the, whole, work, with, the, cuts, then, customary, was, conducted, by, beecham, in, 1928, it, represented, an, effort, by, beecham, to, provide, an, interpretation, which, in, his, opinion, was, nearer, the, composer, s, intentions, with, smaller, forces, and, faster, tempi, than, had, become, traditional, his, contralto, soloist, muriel, brunskill, later, commented, his, tempi, which, are, now, taken, for, granted, were, revolutionary, he, entirely, revitalised, it, nevertheless, sargent, retained, the, large, scale, tradition, in, his, four, hmv, recordings, the, first, in, 1946, and, three, more, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, all, with, the, huddersfield, choral, society, and, the, liverpool, philharmonic, orchestra, beecham, s, second, recording, of, the, work, in, 1947,
