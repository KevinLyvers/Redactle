or, other, written, information, on, a, particular, subject, etymologically, the, term, derives, from, latin, literatura, litteratura, learning, writing, grammar, originally, writing, formed, with, letters, from, litera, littera, letter, in, spite, of, this, the, term, has, also, been, applied, to, spoken, or, sung, texts, literature, is, often, referred, to, synecdochically, as, writing, especially, creative, writing, and, poetically, as, the, craft, of, writing, or, simply, the, craft, syd, field, described, his, discipline, screenwriting, as, a, craft, that, occasionally, rises, to, the, level, of, art, developments, in, print, technology, have, allowed, an, ever, growing, distribution, and, proliferation, of, written, works, which, now, include, electronic, literature,

more, inclusive, notions, so, that, cultural, studies, for, instance, include, in, addition, to, canonical, works, popular, and, minority, genres, the, word, is, also, used, in, reference, to, non, written, works, to, oral, literature, and, the, literature, of, preliterate, culture, a, value, judgment, definition, of, literature, considers, it, as, consisting, solely, of, high, quality, writing, that, forms, part, of, the, belles, lettres, fine, writing, tradition, an, example, of, this, is, in, the, 1910, 1911, encyclop, dia, britannica, which, classified, literature, as, the, best, expression, of, the, best, thought, reduced, to, writing, the, use, of, the, term, literature, here, poses, some, issues, due, to, its, origins, in, the, latin, littera, letter, essentially, writing, alternatives, such, as, oral, forms, and, oral, genres, have, been, suggested, but, the, word, literature, is, widely, used, australian, aboriginal, culture, has, thrived, on, oral, traditions, and, oral, histories, passed, down, through, tens, of, thousands, of, years, in, a, study, published, in, february, 2020, new, evidence, showed, that, both, budj, bim, and, tower, hill, volcanoes, erupted, between, 34, 000, and, 40, 000, years, ago, significantly, this, is, a, minimum, age, constraint, for, human, presence, in, victoria, and, also, could, be, interpreted, as, evidence, for, the, oral, histories, of, the, gunditjmara, people, an, aboriginal, australian, people, of, south, western, victoria, which, tell, of, volcanic, eruptions, being, some, of, the, oldest, oral, traditions, in, existence, an, axe, found, underneath, volcanic, ash, in, 1947, had, already, proven, that, humans, inhabited, the, region, before, the, eruption, of, tower, hill, oral, literature, is, an, ancient, human, tradition, found, in, all, corners, of, the, world, modern, archaeology, has, been, unveiling, evidence, of, the, human, efforts, to, preserve, and, transmit, arts, and, knowledge, that, depended, completely, or, partially, on, an, oral, tradition, across, various, cultures, the, judeo, christian, bible, reveals, its, oral, traditional, roots, medieval, european, manuscripts, are, penned, by, performing, scribes, geometric, vases, from, archaic, greece, mirror, homer, s, oral, style, indeed, if, these, final, decades, of, the, millennium, have, taught, us, anything, it, must, be, that, oral, tradition, never, was, the, other, we, accused, it, of, being, it, never, was, the, primitive, preliminary, technology, of, communication, we, thought, it, to, be, rather, if, the, whole, truth, is, told, oral, tradition, stands, out, as, the, single, most, dominant, communicative, technology, of, our, species, as, both, a, historical, fact, and, in, many, areas, still, a, contemporary, reality, the, earliest, poetry, is, believed, to, have, been, recited, or, sung, employed, as, a, way, of, remembering, history, genealogy, and, law, in, asia, the, transmission, of, folklore, mythologies, as, well, as, scriptures, in, ancient, india, in, different, indian, religions, was, by, oral, tradition, preserved, with, precision, with, the, help, of, elaborate, mnemonic, techniques, the, early, buddhist, texts, are, also, generally, believed, to, be, of, oral, tradition, with, the, first, by, comparing, inconsistencies, in, the, transmitted, versions, of, literature, from, various, oral, societies, such, as, the, greek, serbia, and, other, cultures, then, noting, that, the, vedic, literature, is, too, consistent, and, vast, to, have, been, composed, and, transmitted, orally, across, generations, without, being, written, down, according, to, goody, the, vedic, texts, likely, involved, both, a, written, and, oral, tradition, calling, it, a, parallel, products, of, a, literate, society, all, ancient, greek, literature, was, to, some, degree, oral, in, nature, and, the, earliest, literature, was, completely, so, homer, s, epic, poetry, states, michael, gagarin, was, largely, composed, performed, and, transmitted, orally, as, folklores, and, legends, were, performed, in, front, of, distant, audiences, the, singers, would, substitute, the, names, in, the, stories, with, local, characters, or, rulers, to, give, the, stories, a, local, flavor, and, thus, connect, with, the, audience, by, making, the, historicity, embedded, in, the, oral, tradition, as, unreliable, the, lack, of, surviving, texts, about, the, greek, and, roman, religious, traditions, have, led, scholars, to, presume, that, these, were, ritualistic, and, transmitted, as, oral, traditions, but, some, scholars, disagree, that, the, complex, rituals, in, the, ancient, greek, and, roman, civilizations, were, an, exclusive, product, of, an, oral, tradition, writing, systems, are, not, known, to, have, existed, among, native, north, americans, north, of, mesoamerica, before, contact, with, europeans, oral, storytelling, traditions, flourished, in, a, context, without, the, use, of, writing, to, record, and, preserve, history, scientific, knowledge, and, social, practices, while, some, stories, were, told, for, amusement, and, leisure, most, functioned, as,

the, story, s, audience, in, this, way, social, pressure, could, be, exerted, without, directly, causing, embarrassment, or, social, exclusion, for, example, rather, than, yelling, inuit, parents, might, deter, their, children, from, wandering, too, close, to, the, water, s, edge, by, telling, a, story, about, a, sea, monster, with, a, pouch, for, children, within, its, reach, the, enduring, significance, of, oral, traditions, is, underscored, in, a, systemic, literature, review, on, indigenous, languages, in, south, africa, within, the, framework, of, contemporary, linguistic, challenges, oral, literature, is, crucial, for, cultural, preservation, linguistic, diversity, and, social, justice, as, evidenced, by, the, postcolonial, struggles, and, ongoing, initiatives, to,

distinguished, from, prose, by, its, greater, use, of, the, aesthetic, qualities, of, language, including, musical, devices, such, as, assonance, alliteration, rhyme, and, rhythm, and, by, being, set, in, lines, and, verses, rather, than, paragraphs, and, more, recently, its, use, of, other, typographical, elements, this, distinction, is, complicated, by, various, hybrid, forms, such, as, digital, poetry, sound, poetry, concrete, poetry, and, prose, poem, and, more, generally, by, the, fact, that, prose, possesses, rhythm, abram, lipsky, refers, to, it, as, an, open, secret, that, prose, is, not, distinguished, from, poetry, by, lack, of, rhythm, prior, to, the, 19th, century, poetry, was, commonly, understood, to, be, something, set, in, metrical, lines, any, kind, of, subject, consisting, of, rhythm, or, verses, possibly, as, a, result, of, aristotle, s, influence, his, poetics, poetry, before, the, 19th, century, was, usually, less, a, technical, designation, for, verse, than, a, normative, category, of, fictive, or, rhetorical, art, as, a, form, it, may, pre, date, literacy, with, the, earliest, works, being, composed, within, and, sustained, by, an, oral, tradition, hence, it, constitutes, the, earliest, example, of, literature, as, noted, above, prose, generally, makes, far, less, use, of, the, aesthetic, qualities, of, language, than, poetry, however, developments, in, modern, literature, including, free, verse, and, prose, poetry, have, tended, to, blur, the, differences, and, poet, t, s, eliot, suggested, that, while, the, distinction, between,
