machu, picchu, is, a, 15th, century, inca, citadel, located, in, the, eastern, cordillera, of, southern, peru, on, a, mountain, ridge, at, 2, 430, meters, 7, 970, ft, often, referred, to, as, the, lost, city, of, the, incas, it, is, the, most, familiar, icon, of, the, inca, empire, it, is, located, in, the, machupicchu, district, within, urubamba, province, above, the, sacred, valley, which, is, 80, kilometers, 50, mi, northwest, of, cusco, the, urubamba, river, flows, past, it, cutting, through, the, cordillera, and, creating, a, canyon, with, a, subtropical, mountain, climate, the, inca, civilization, had, no, written, language, and, following, the, first, encounter, by, the, spanish, soldier, baltasar, ocampo, no, europeans, are, recorded, to, have, visited, the, site, from, the, late, 16th, century, until, the, 19th, century, as, far, as, historical, knowledge, extends, there, are, no, existing, written, records, detailing, the, site, during, its, period, of, active, use, the, names, of, the, buildings, their, supposed, uses, and, their, inhabitants, are, the, product, of, modern, archaeologists, based, on, physical, evidence, including, tombs, at, the, site, machu, picchu, was, built, in, the, classical, inca, style, with, polished, dry, stone, walls, its, three, primary, structures, are, the, temple, of, the, sun, the, temple, of, the, three, windows, and, the, intihuatana, from, 1929, to, 1971, machu, picchu, underwent, extensive, restoration, and, conservation, work, including, structural, stabilization, and, artifact, excavation, driven, by, government, initiatives, and, research, expeditions, most, recent, archaeologists, believe, that, machu, picchu, was, constructed, as, an, estate, for, the, inca, emperor, pachacuti, 1438, 1472, the, inca, built, the, estate, around, 1450, but, abandoned, it, a, century, later, at, the, time, of, the, spanish, conquest, according, to, the, new, ams, radiocarbon, dating, it, was, occupied, from, c, 1420, 1532, historical, research, published, in, 2022, claims, that, the, site, was, probably, called, huayna, picchu, by, the, inca, people, themselves, as, it, exists, on, the, smaller, peak, of, the, same, name, machu, picchu, was, declared, a, peruvian, historic, sanctuary, in, 1982, and, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, in, 1983, in, 2007, machu, picchu, was, voted, one, of, the, new, seven, wonders, of, the, world, in, a, worldwide, internet, poll, the, site, is, on, a, narrow, saddle, between, two, mountain, peaks, machu, picchu, and, huayna, picchu, in, the, quechua, language, machu, means, old, or, old, person, and, wayna, means, young, while, pikchu, refers, to, a, summit, peak, or, pyramid, thus, the, name, of, the, site, is, often, translated, as, old, mountain, or, old, peak, although, the, original, name, given, to, the, settlement, by, its, builders, is, not, definitively, known, a, 2021, study, in, awpa, pacha, journal, of, the, institute, of, andean, studies, suggests, that, the, site, was, likely, called, huayna, picchu, after, the, smaller, peak, nearby, or, simply, picchu, according, to, the, research, the, association, of, the, name, machu, picchu, with, the, ruins, likely, began, with, american, explorer, hiram, bingham, s, 1911, publications, a, conclusion, supported, by, bingham, s, field, notes, early, maps, and, historical, documents, machu, picchu, was, previously, believed, by, richard, l, burger, professor, of, anthropology, at, yale, university, to, have, been, built, in, the, 1450s, however, a, 2021, study, led, by, burger, used, radiocarbon, dating, specifically, ams, to, reveal, that, machu, picchu, may, have, been, occupied, from, around, 1420, to, 1530, ad, construction, appears, to, date, from, two, great, inca, rulers, pachacutec, inca, yupanqui, 1438, 1471, and, t, pac, inca, yupanqui, 1472, 1493, xxxvi, a, consensus, among, archaeologists, is, that, pachacutec, ordered, the, construction, of, the, royal, estate, for, his, use, as, a, retreat, most, likely, after, a, successful, military, campaign, although, machu, picchu, is, considered, to, be, a, royal, estate, it, would, not, have, been, passed, down, in, the, line, of, succession, rather, it, was, used, for, 80, years, before, being, abandoned, seemingly, because, of, the, spanish, conquests, in, other, parts, of, the, inca, empire, it, is, possible, that, most, of, its, inhabitants, died, from, smallpox, introduced, by, travelers, before, the, spanish, conquistadors, even, arrived, in, the, area, during, its, use, as, an, estate, it, is, estimated, that, about, 750, people, lived, there, with, most, serving, as, support, staff, yanaconas, yana, who, lived, there, permanently, though, the, estate, belonged, to, pachacutec, religious, specialists, and, temporary, specialized, workers, mayocs, lived, there, as, well, most, likely, for, the, ruler, s, well, being, and, enjoyment, during, the, harsher, season, staffing, was, reduced, to, a, few, hundred, servants, and, a, few, religious, specialists, focused, on, maintenance, alone, studies, show, that, according, to, their, skeletal, remains, most, people, who, lived, there, were, immigrants, from, diverse, backgrounds, they, lacked, the, chemical, markers, and, osteological, markers, they, would, have, if, they, had, been, living, there, their, entire, lives, instead, research, into, skeletal, remains, has, found, bone, damage, from, various, species, of, water, parasites, indigenous, to, different, areas, of, peru, there, were, also, varying, osteological, stressors, and, varying, chemical, densities, suggesting, varying, long, term, diets, characteristic, of, specific, regions, that, were, spaced, apart, these, diets, are, composed, of, varying, levels, of, maize, potatoes, grains, legumes, and, fish, but, the, last, known, short, term, diet, for, these, people, was, overall, composed, of, less, fish, and, more, corn, this, suggests, that, several, of, the, immigrants, were, from, more, coastal, areas, and, moved, to, machu, picchu, where, corn, was, a, larger, portion, of, food, intake, most, skeletal, remains, found, at, the, site, had, lower, levels, of, arthritis, and, bone, fractures, than, those, found, in, most, sites, of, the, inca, empire, incan, individuals, who, had, arthritis, and, bone, fractures, were, typically, those, who, performed, heavy, physical, labor, such, as, the, mit, a, or, served, in, the, inca, military, animals, are, also, suspected, to, have, been, brought, to, machu, picchu, as, there, were, several, bones, found, that, were, not, native, to, the, area, most, animal, bones, found, were, from, llamas, and, alpacas, these, animals, naturally, live, at, altitudes, of, 4, 000, meters, 13, 000, ft, rather, than, the, 2, 400, meters, 7, 900, ft, elevation, of, machu, picchu, most, likely, these, animals, were, brought, in, from, the, puna, region, for, meat, consumption, and, for, their, pelts, guinea, pigs, were, also, found, at, the, site, in, special, tomb, caves, suggesting, that, they, were, at, least, used, for, funerary, rituals, as, it, was, common, throughout, the, inca, empire, to, use, them, for, sacrifices, and, meat, six, dogs, were, also, recovered, from, the, site, due, to, their, placements, among, the, human, remains, it, is, believed, that, they, served, as, companions, of, the, dead, much, of, the, farming, done, at, machu, picchu, was, done, on, its, hundreds, of, andenes, man, made, terraces, these, terraces, were, a, work, of, considerable, engineering, built, to, ensure, good, drainage, and, soil, fertility, while, also, protecting, the, mountain, itself, from, erosion, and, landslides, however, the, terraces, were, not, perfect, as, studies, of, the, land, show, that, there, were, landslides, that, happened, during, the, construction, of, machu, picchu, still, visible, are, places, where, the, terraces, were, shifted, by, landslides, and, then, stabilized, by, the, inca, as, they, continued, to, build, around, the, area, the, terraces, also, enabled, irrigation, increasing, crop, yields, with, maize, likely, being, the, main, crop, due, to, its, ceremonial, importance, alongside, possible, cultivation, of, potatoes, however, terrace, farming, area, makes, up, only, about, 4, 9, ha, 12, acres, of, land, and, a, study, of, the, soil, around, the, terraces, showed, that, what, was, grown, there, was, mostly, corn, and, potatoes, which, was, not, enough, to, support, the, 750, people, living, at, machu, picchu, this, explains, why, studies, done, on, the, food, that, the, inca, ate, at, machu, picchu, suggest, it, was, imported, from, the, surrounding, valleys, and, farther, afield, it, is, estimated, that, the, area, around, the, site, has, received, more, than, 1, 800, mm, 71, in, of, rain, per, year, since, ad, 1450, which, was, more, than, that, needed, to, support, crop, growth, because, of, the, ample, rainfall, at, machu, picchu, it, was, found, that, irrigation, was, not, usually, needed, for, the, terraces, the, terraces, received, so, much, rain, that, they, were, built, by, incan, engineers, specifically, to, allow, for, drainage, of, excess, water, excavation, and, soil, analyses, done, by, kenneth, wright, in, the, 1990s, showed, that, the, terraces, were, built, in, layers, with, a, bottom, layer, of, larger, stones, covered, by, loose, gravel, on, top, of, the, gravel, was, a, layer, of, mixed, sand, and, gravel, packed, together, with, rich, topsoil, covering, it, research, showed, that, the, topsoil, was, probably, moved, from, the, valley, floor, to, the, terraces, because, it, was, much, better, than, the, soil, higher, up, the, mountain, little, information, exists, surrounding, human, sacrifices, at, machu, picchu, though, it, is, known, that, many, sacrifices, were, never, given, a, proper, burial, and, their, skeletal, remains, succumbed, to, the, elements, however, there, is, evidence, that, retainers, were, sacrificed, to, accompany, a, deceased, noble, in, the, afterlife, 107, 119, animal, liquid, and, dirt, sacrifices, to, the, gods, were, more, common, and, were, made, at, the, altar, of, the, condor, the, tradition, is, upheld, by, members, of, the, new, age, andean, religion, 263, in, the, late, 16th, century, spaniards, who, had, recently, gained, control, of, the, area, documented, that, indigenous, individuals, mentioned, returning, to, huayna, picchu, the, name, that, is, believed, to, be, originally, given, to, the, site, by, locals, the, spanish, conquistador, baltasar, de, ocampo, had, notes, of, a, visit, during, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, to, a, mountain, fortress, called, pitcos, with, sumptuous, and, majestic, buildings, erected, with, great, skill, and, art, all, the, lintels, of, the, doors, as, well, the, principal, as, the, ordinary, ones, being, of, marble, and, elaborately, carved, over, the, centuries, the, surrounding, jungle, overgrew, the, site, and, few, outside, the, immediate, area, knew, of, its, existence, the, site, may, have, been, re, discovered, and, plundered, in, 1867, by, a, german, businessman, augusto, berns, some, evidence, indicates, that, the, german, engineer, j, m, von, hassel, arrived, earlier, maps, show, references, to, machu, picchu, as, early, as, 1874, a, 1904, atlas, designated, the, site, as, huayna, picchu, in, 1911, american, historian, and, explorer, hiram, bingham, traveled, the, region, looking, for, the, lost, capital, of, the, neo, inca, state, later, established, to, be, vilcabamba, established, by, manco, inca, after, the, spanish, conquest, and, was, led, to, machu, picchu, by, a, villager, melchor, arteaga, bingham, found, the, name, agust, n, liz, rraga, and, the, date, 1902, written, in, charcoal, on, one, of, the, walls, of, the, temple, of, the, three, windows, initially, disappointed, he, documented, in, his, pocket, field, journal, agust, n, liz, rraga, is, discoverer, of, machu, picchu, and, lives, at, san, miguel, bridge, just, before, passing, however, while, bingham, initially, acknowledged, liz, rraga, as, the, discoverer, in, his, early, writings, and, speeches, including, inca, land, 1922, he, gradually, downplayed, liz, rraga, s, role, until, in, his, final, version, of, the, story, lost, city, of, the, incas, 1952, bingham, claimed, to, have, found, the, site, himself, though, bingham, was, not, the, first, to, visit, the, ruins, he, was, considered, the, scientific, discoverer, who, brought, machu, picchu, to, international, attention, bingham, organized, another, expedition, in, 1912, to, undertake, major, clearing, and, excavation, xxx, xxxi, bingham, was, a, lecturer, at, yale, university, although, not, a, trained, archaeologist, in, 1909, returning, from, the, pan, american, scientific, congress, in, santiago, he, travelled, through, peru, and, was, invited, to, explore, the, inca, ruins, at, choqquequirau, in, the, apur, mac, valley, he, organized, the, 1911, yale, peruvian, expedition, in, part, to, search, for, the, inca, capital, which, was, thought, to, be, the, city, of, vitcos, he, consulted, carlos, romero, one, of, the, chief, historians, in, lima, who, showed, him, helpful, references, and, father, antonio, de, la, calancha, s, chronicle, of, the, augustinians, in, particular, ramos, thought, vitcos, was, near, a, great, white, rock, over, a, spring, of, fresh, water, back, in, cusco, again, bingham, asked, planters, about, the, places, mentioned, by, calancha, particularly, along, the, urubamba, river, according, to, bingham, one, old, prospector, said, there, were, interesting, ruins, at, machu, picchu, though, his, statements, were, given, no, importance, by, the, leading, citizens, only, later, did, bingham, learn, that, charles, wiener, had, also, heard, of, the, ruins, at, huayna, picchu, and, machu, picchu, but, was, unable, to, reach, them, armed, with, this, information, bingham, s, expedition, went, down, the, urubamba, river, en, route, bingham, asked, local, people, to, show, them, inca, ruins, especially, any, place, described, as, having, a, white, rock, over, a, spring, 137, at, mandor, pampa, bingham, asked, farmer, and, innkeeper, melchor, arteaga, if, he, knew, of, any, nearby, ruins, arteaga, said, he, knew, of, excellent, ruins, on, the, top, of, huayna, picchu, the, next, day, 24, july, arteaga, led, bingham, and, sergeant, carrasco, across, the, river, on, a, log, bridge, and, up, the, machu, picchu, site, at, the, top, of, the, mountain, they, came, across, a, small, hut, occupied, by, a, couple, of, quechua, people, richard, and, alvarez, who, were, farming, some, of, the, original, machu, picchu, agricultural, terraces, that, they, had, cleared, four, years, earlier, alvarez, s, 11, year, old, son, pablito, led, bingham, along, the, ridge, to, the, main, ruins, the, ruins, were, mostly, covered, with, vegetation, except, for, the, cleared, agricultural, terraces, and, clearings, used, by, the, farmers, as, vegetable, gardens, because, of, the, vegetation, bingham, was, not, able, to, observe, the, full, extent, of, the, site, he, took, preliminary, notes, measurements, and, photographs, noting, the, fine, quality, of, inca, stonework, of, several, principal, buildings, bingham, was, unsure, about, the, original, purpose, of, the, ruins, but, concluded, there, was, no, indication, that, it, matched, the, description, of, vitcos, 141, 186, 187, the, expedition, continued, down, the, urubamba, and, up, the, vilcabamba, rivers, examining, all, the, ruins, they, could, find, guided, by, locals, bingham, rediscovered, and, correctly, identified, the, site, of, the, old, inca, capital, vitcos, then, called, rosaspata, and, the, nearby, temple, of, chuquipalta, he, then, crossed, a, pass, and, into, the, pampaconas, valley, where, he, found, more, ruins, heavily, buried, in, the, jungle, undergrowth, at, esp, ritu, pampa, which, he, named, trombone, pampa, as, was, the, case, with, machu, picchu, the, site, was, so, heavily, overgrown, that, bingham, could, only, note, a, few, of, the, buildings, in, 1964, gene, savoy, further, explored, the, ruins, at, espiritu, pampa, and, revealed, the, full, extent, of, the, site, identifying, it, as, vilcabamba, viejo, where, the, incas, fled, after, the, spanish, drove, them, from, vitcos, xxxv, bingham, returned, to, machu, picchu, in, 1912, under, the, sponsorship, of, yale, university, and, national, geographic, and, with, the, full, support, of, peruvian, president, augusto, leguia, the, expedition, undertook, a, four, month, clearing, of, the, site, with, local, labor, which, was, expedited, with, the, support, of, the, prefect, of, cusco, excavation, started, in, 1912, with, further, excavation, undertaken, in, 1914, and, 1915, bingham, focused, on, machu, picchu, because, of, its, fine, inca, stonework, and, well, preserved, nature, which, had, lain, undisturbed, since, the, site, was, abandoned, none, of, bingham, s, several, hypotheses, explaining, the, site, have, since, held, up, during, his, studies, he, carried, various, artifacts, back, to, yale, one, prominent, artifact, was, a, set, of, 15th, century, ceremonial, incan, knives, made, from, bismuth, bronze, they, are, the, earliest, known, artifact, containing, this, alloy, although, local, institutions, initially, welcomed, the, exploration, they, soon, accused, bingham, of, legal, and, cultural, malpractice, rumors, arose, that, the, team, was, stealing, artifacts, and, smuggling, them, out, of, peru, through, bolivia, in, fact, bingham, removed, many, artifacts, but, openly, and, legally, they, were, deposited, in, the, yale, university, museum, bingham, was, abiding, by, the, 1852, civil, code, of, peru, the, code, stated, that, archaeological, finds, generally, belonged, to, the, discoverer, except, when, they, had, been, discovered, on, private, land, batievsky, 100, local, press, perpetuated, the, accusations, claiming, that, the, excavation, harmed, the, site, and, deprived, local, archaeologists, of, knowledge, about, their, own, history, landowners, began, to, demand, rent, from, the, excavators, by, the, time, bingham, and, his, team, left, machu, picchu, locals, had, formed, coalitions, to, defend, their, ownership, of, machu, picchu, and, its, cultural, remains, while, bingham, claimed, the, artifacts, ought, to, be, studied, by, experts, in, american, institutions, in, 1981, peru, declared, an, area, of, 325, 92, square, kilometers, 125, 84, sq, mi, surrounding, machu, picchu, a, historic, sanctuary, in, addition, to, the, ruins, the, sanctuary, includes, a, large, portion, of, the, adjoining, region, rich, with, the, flora, and, fauna, of, the, peruvian, yungas, and, central, andean, wet, puna, ecoregions, beyond, its, historical, significance, machu, picchu, houses, a, diverse, range, of, species, among, them, are, the, andean, fox, puma, vizcacha, spectacled, bear, and, white, tailed, deer, the, sanctuary, is, also, habitat, for, more, than, 420, bird, species, notably, the, cock, of, the, rock, and, the, andean, condor, the, surrounding, environment, features, a, variety, of, tree, species, such, as, alder, white, cedar, husk, and, laurel, in, 1983, unesco, designated, machu, picchu, a, world, heritage, site, describing, it, as, a, masterpiece, of, art, urbanism, architecture, and, engineering, and, a, unique, testimony, of, the, inca, civilization, along, the, urubamba, river, below, the, ruins, surrounding, the, train, line, street, is, the, town, of, machu, picchu, also, known, as, aguas, calientes, hot, springs, with, a, post, office, a, train, station, hotels, and, other, services, for, the, many, tourists, the, station, called, puente, ruinas, the, bridge, to, the, ruins, is, the, end, of, the, line, for, the, tren, de, turismo, the, tourist, train, which, arrives, every, morning, from, cusco, and, returns, every, afternoon, there, is, also, a, luxury, hotel, on, the, mountain, near, the, ruins, machu, picchu, is, officially, twinned, with, haworth, west, yorkshire, in, the, united, kingdom, as, well, as, fukushima, and, tama, japan, petra, jordan, medley, united, states, and, tinum, mexico, machu, picchu, is, both, a, cultural, and, natural, unesco, world, heritage, site, since, hiram, bingham, s, expedition, growing, numbers, of, tourists, have, visited, the, site, each, year, with, numbers, exceeding, 1, 5, million, in, 2019, as, peru, s, most, visited, tourist, attraction, and, a, major, revenue, generator, it, is, continually, exposed, to, economic, and, commercial, forces, in, the, late, 1990s, the, peruvian, government, granted, concessions, to, allow, the, construction, of, a, cable, car, and, a, luxury, hotel, including, a, tourist, complex, with, boutiques, and, restaurants, and, a, bridge, to, the, site, these, plans, faced, widespread, protests, with, critics, arguing, that, the, government, had, failed, to, conduct, a, proper, environmental, impact, survey, as, requested, by, the, national, institute, of, natural, resources, which, warned, of, potential, harm, to, the, ecosystem, in, 2018, plans, were, restarted, to, again, construct, a, cable, car, to, encourage, peruvians, to, visit, machu, picchu, and, boost, domestic, tourism, a, no, fly, zone, exists, above, the, area, unesco, considered, including, machu, picchu, on, its, list, of, world, heritage, in, danger, in, 2017, but, ultimately, decided, against, it, efforts, to, manage, the, impact, of, tourism, have, included, various, measures, over, the, years, in, the, 1980s, a, rock, from, machu, picchu, s, central, plaza, was, moved, to, create, a, helicopter, landing, zone, a, practice, which, was, later, stopped, in, 2006, the, company, helicusco, sought, approval, for, tourist, flights, over, the, site, but, the, license, was, soon, rescinded, in, january, 2010, severe, flooding, caused, by, el, ni, o, trapped, over, 4, 000, people, and, disrupted, access, to, machu, picchu, leading, to, its, temporary, closure, the, site, reopened, on, april, 1, 2010, to, further, address, tourism, s, impact, stricter, entrance, regulations, were, introduced, in, july, 2011, limiting, the, number, of, daily, visitors, to, 2, 500, per, day, to, the, citadel, and, 400, to, huayna, picchu, in, 2018, a, third, entrance, phase, was, added, to, better, manage, tourism, and, reduce, site, degradation, in, 2024, the, daily, visitor, limit, was, officially, increased, to, 4, 500, with, up, to, 5, 600, permitted, during, peak, season, in, may, 2012, unesco, urged, additional, protection, measures, for, the, site, s, buffer, zone, especially, due, to, the, rapid, growth, in, the, nearby, town, of, aguas, calientes, tourist, deaths, at, machu, picchu, from, altitude, sickness, floods, and, accidents, have, led, to, criticism, of, unesco, for, allowing, visits, despite, the, site, s, high, safety, risks, the, trend, of, nude, tourism, in, 2014, also, led, to, increased, surveillance, by, peru, s, ministry, of, culture, to, end, the, practice, in, recognition, of, efforts, to, manage, and, protect, the, site, fernando, astete, who, served, as, chief, of, the, national, archaeological, park, of, machu, picchu, from, 1994, to, 2019, was, honored, with, the, personalidad, meritoria, de, la, cultura, award, by, the, ministry, of, culture, of, peru, in, january, 2020, this, award, acknowledged, his, extensive, contributions, to, the, preservation, management, and, study, of, machu, picchu, during, the, 2022, 2023, peruvian, protests, routes, to, machu, picchu, were, blocked, trapping, thousands, of, tourists, and, leading, to, a, government, airlift, of, the, stranded, visitors, due, to, these, disruptions, the, ministry, of, culture, closed, the, site, indefinitely, on, january, 22, 2023, and, it, was, reopened, on, february, 15, 2023, machu, picchu, lies, in, the, southern, hemisphere, 13, 111, degrees, south, of, the, equator, it, is, 80, kilometers, 50, miles, northwest, of, cusco, on, the, crest, of, the, mountain, machu, picchu, located, about, 2, 430, meters, 7, 970, feet, above, mean, sea, level, over, 1, 000, meters, 3, 300,

archaeological, sites, in, south, america, one, of, the, most, visited, tourist, attractions, in, latin, america, and, the, most, visited, in, peru, machu, picchu, is, situated, above, a, bow, of, the, urubamba, river, which, surrounds, the, site, on, three, sides, where, cliffs, drop, vertically, for, 450, meters, 1, 480, ft, to, the, river, at, their, base, the, area, is, subject, to, morning, mists, rising, from, the, river, when, inhabited, by, the, incas, the, location, of, the, city, was, a, military, secret, and, its, deep, precipices, and, steep, mountains, provided, natural, defenses, the, inca, bridge, an, inca, grass, rope, bridge, across, the, urubamba, river, in, the, pongo, de, mainique, provided, a, secret, entrance, for, the, inca, army, another, inca, bridge, was, built, to, the, west, of, machu, picchu, the, tree, trunk, bridge, at, a, location, where, a, gap, occurs, in, the, cliff, that, measures, 6, meters, 20, ft, the, city, sits, in, a, saddle, between, the, two, mountains, machu, picchu, and, huayna, picchu, with, a, view, down, two, valleys, and, a, nearly, impassable, mountain, at, its, back, the, agricultural, terraces, covering, about, 4, 9, hectares, 12, acres, complemented, the, site, s, architecture, and, protected, against, runoff, and, erosion, constructed, with, stone, retaining, walls, and, well, drained, topsoil, the, terraces, were, built, using, deeper, strata, and, stone, chips, to, enhance, drainage, and, ensure, stability, two, high, altitude, routes, from, machu, picchu, cross, the, mountains, back, to, cusco, one, through, the, sun, gate, and, the, other, across, the, inca, bridge, both, could, have, been, blocked, easily, should, invaders, have, approached, along, them, machu, picchu, and, other, sites, in, the, area, are, built, over, earthquake, faults, according, to, research, conducted, in, 2019, this, may, not, be, a, coincidence, ne, simple, answer, researchers, now, suggest, is, that, that, s, where, building, materials, for, the, site, large, amounts, of, already, fractured, rock, were, readily, available, between, the, valley, floor, and, the, altitudinal, zone, of, the, inca, citadel,

onto, the, terrace, of, the, ceremonial, rock, the, three, sided, style, of, inca, architecture, is, known, as, the, wayrona, style, in, 2005, and, 2009, the, university, of, arkansas, made, detailed, laser, scans, of, the, entire, site, and, of, the, ruins, at, the, top, of, the, adjacent, huayna, picchu, mountain, the, scan, data, is, available, online, for, research, purposes, this, semicircular, temple, is, built, on, the, same, rock, overlying, bingham, s, royal, mausoleum, and, is, similar, to, the, temple, of, the, sun, found, in, cusco, and, the, one, found, in, pisac, in, having, what, bingham, described, as, a, parabolic, enclosure, wall, the, stonework, is, of, ashlar, quality, within, the, temple, is, a, 1, 2, m, by, 2, 7, m, rock, platform, smooth, on, top, except, for, a, small, platform, on, its, southwest, quadrant, a, serpent, s, door, faces, 340, or, just, west, of, north, opening, onto, a, series, of, 16, pools, and, affording, a, view, of, huayna, picchu, the, temple, also, has, two, trapezoidal, windows, one, facing, 65, called, the, solstice, window, and, the, other, facing, 132, called, the, qullqa, window, the, northwest, edge, of, the, rock, platform, points, out, the, solstice, window, to, within, 2, of, the, 15th, century, june, solstice, rising, sun, for, comparison, the, angular, diameter, of, the, sun, is, 32, the, inca, constellation, qullca, storehouse, can, be, viewed, out, the, qullqa, window, at, sunset, during, the, 15th, century, june, solstice, hence, the, window, s, name, at, the, same, time, the, pleaides, are, at, the, opposite, end, of, the, sky, also, seen, through, this, window, on, this, night, are, the, constellations, llamacnawin, llama, unallamacha, machacuay, and, the, star, pachapacariq, chaska, canopus, the, intihuatana, stone, is, a, ritual, stone, which, was, used, by, the, incas, the, stone, is, designed, to, point, directly, at, the, sun, during, the, winter, solstice, the, name, of, the, stone, perhaps, coined, by, bingham, derives, from, quechua, language, inti, means, sun, and, wata, to, tie, hitch, up, the, suffix, na, derives, nouns, for, tools, or, places, hence,

pillar, casting, no, shadow, on, 21, june, the, stone, casts, the, longest, shadow, on, its, southern, side, and, on, 21, december, a, much, shorter, shadow, on, its, northern, side, inti, mach, ay, is, a, special, cave, used, to, observe, the, royal, feast, of, the, sun, this, festival, was, celebrated, during, the, incan, month, of, qhapaq, raymi, it, began, earlier, in, the, month, and, concluded, on, the, december, solstice, on, this, day, noble, boys, were, initiated, into, manhood, by, an, ear, piercing, ritual, as, they, stood, inside, the, cave, and, watched, the, sunrise, architecturally, inti, mach, ay, is, often, considered, to, be, the, most, significant, structure, at, machu, picchu, its, entrances, walls, steps, and, windows, are, some, of, the, finest, masonry, in, the, incan, empire, the, cave, also, includes, a, tunnel, like, window, unique, among, incan, structures, which, was, constructed, to, allow, sunlight, into, the, cave, only, during, several, days, around, the, december, solstice, for, this, reason, the, cave, was, inaccessible, for, much, of, the, year, inti, mach, ay, is, located, on, the, eastern, side, of, machu, picchu, just, north, of, the, condor, stone, many, of, the, caves, surrounding, this, area, were, prehistorically, used, as, tombs, yet, there, is, no, evidence, that, mach, ay, was, a, burial, ground, in, 1912, 1914, and, 1915, bingham, removed, thousands, of, artifacts, from, machu, picchu, ceramic, vessels, silver, statues, jewelry, and, human, bones, and, took, them, to, yale, university, for, further, study, supposedly, for, 18, months, yale, instead, kept, the, artifacts, until, 2012, arguing, that, peru, lacked, the, infrastructure, and, systems, to, care, for, them, eliane, karp, an, anthropologist, and, wife, of, former, peruvian, president, alejandro, toledo, accused, yale, of, profiting, from, peru, s, cultural, heritage, many, of, the, articles, were, exhibited, at, yale, s, peabody, museum, in, 2006, yale, returned, some, pieces, but, retained, more, than, 250, museum, quality, pieces, claiming, this, was, supported, by, federal, case, law, of, peruvian, antiquities, in, 2007, the, peruvian, government, and, yale, had, agreed, on, a, joint, traveling, exhibition, and, construction, of, a, new, museum, and, research, center, in, cusco, advised, by, yale, yale, acknowledged, peru, s, title, to, all, the, objects, but, would, share, rights, with, peru, in, the, research, collection, part, of, which, would, remain, at, yale, for, continuing, study, in, november, 2010, yale, agreed, to, return, the, disputed, artifacts, the, third, and, final, batch, of, artifacts, was, delivered, in, november, 2012, the, artifacts, are, permanently, exhibited, at, the, museo, machu, picchu, la, casa, concha, the, shell, house, close, to, cusco, s, colonial, center, owned, by, the, national, university, of, san, antonio, abad, del, cusco, la, casa, concha, also, features, a, study, area, for, local, and, foreign, students, the, central, buildings, in, the, machu, picchu, citadel, use, the, classical, inca, architectural, style, of, polished, dry, stone, walls, of, regular, shape, the, incas, were, masters, of, this, technique, called, ashlar, in, which, blocks, of, stone, are, cut, to, fit, together, tightly, without, mortar, the, site, may, have, been, intentionally, built, on, fault, lines, to, provide, natural, drainage, and, a, source, of, fractured, stone, for, construction, according, to, geologist, rualdo, menegat, machu, picchu, shows, us, that, the, incan, civilization, was, an, empire, of, fractured, rocks, the, section, of, the, mountain, where, machu, picchu, was, built, provided, various, challenges, that, the, incas, solved, with, local, materials, one, issue, was, the, seismic, activity, due, to, two, fault, lines, which, made, mortar, and, similar, building, methods, nearly, useless, instead, the, inca, mined, stones, from, some, quarries, at, the, site, including, one, recently, discovered, using, remote, sensing, techniques, which, was, probably, located, in, the, catchment, area, between, the, hurin, and, hanan, before, it, was, covered, over, to, create, the, current, plaza, principal, once, mined, the, inca, lined, the, granite, stones, up, and, shaped, them, to, fit, together, perfectly, stabilizing, the, structures, inca, walls, have, many, stabilizing, features, doors, and, windows, are, trapezoidal, narrowing, from, bottom, to, top, corners, usually, are, rounded, inside, corners, often, incline, slightly, into, the, rooms, and, outside, corners, were, often, tied, together, by, l, shaped, blocks, walls, are, offset, slightly, from, row, to, row, rather, than, rising, straight, from, bottom, to, top, heavy, rainfall, required, terraces, to, drain, rain, water, and, prevent, mudslides, landslides, erosion, and, flooding, terraces, were, layered, with, stone, chips, sand, dirt, and, topsoil, to, absorb, water, and, prevent, it, from, running, down, the, mountain, similar, layering, protected, the, large, city, center, from, flooding, multiple, canals, and, reserves, throughout, the, city, provided, water, that, could, be, supplied, to, the, terraces, for, irrigation, and, to, prevent, erosion, and, flooding, the, approach, to, moving, and, placing, the, enormous, stones, remains, uncertain, probably, involving, hundreds, of, men, to, push, the, stones, up, inclines, a, few, stones, have, knobs, that, could, have, been, used, to, lever, them, into, position, the, knobs, were, generally, sanded, away, with, a, few, overlooked, for, larger, stones, the, incas, likely, employed, ramps, with, gentle, inclines, along, with, wooden, rollers, levers, and, ropes, made, from, maguey, fibers, most, stones, were, moved, from, higher, to, lower, elevations, but, some, like, those, at, ollantaytambo, were, transported, over, long, distances, the, inca, road, system, included, a, route, to, the, machu, picchu, region, the, people, of, machu, picchu, were, connected, to, long, distance, trade, as, shown, by, non, local, artifacts, found, at, the, site, for, example, bingham, found, unmodified, obsidian, nodules, at, the, entrance, gateway, in, the, 1970s, burger, and, asaro, determined, that, these, obsidian, samples, were, from, the, titicaca, or, chivay, obsidian, source, and, that, the, samples, from, machu, picchu, showed, long, distance, transport, of, this, obsidian, type, in, pre, hispanic, peru, today, visitors, can, reach, machu, picchu, via, three, main, routes, the, most, popular, option, is, the, train, journey, from, cusco, or, ollantaytambo, operated, by, perurail, and, inca, rail, this, scenic, route, takes, visitors, to, the, town, of, aguas, calientes, from, where, they, can, take, a, bus, ride, of, 8, 6, kilometres, 5, 3, mi, or, walk, to, the, machu, picchu, entrance, 94, another, widely, chosen, route, is, the, inca, trail, a, historic, path, built, by, the, incas, considered, the, most, famous, hike, in, south, america, by, lonely, planet, attracting, thousands, of, tourists, each, year, the, trail, which, starts, at, piscacucho, also, known, as, km, 82, on, the, railway, to, aguas, calientes, or, km, 104, depending, on, the, length, of, the, trek, spans, approximately, 42, kilometres, 26, mi, and, reaches, an, altitude, of, 4, 200, metres, 13, 800, ft, it, passes, through, the, andes, and, various, archaeological, sites, before, reaching, the, sun, gate, intipunku, at, machu, picchu, due, to, limited, permits, advance, booking, through, a, tourism, agency, is, required, alternatively, travelers, can, take, a, less, conventional, route, that, involves, traveling, by, road, to, a, point, near, the, hydroelectric, station, from, there, they, can, either, walk, or, take, a, short, train, ride, to, aguas, calientes, 86, this, option, is, generally, more, affordable, and, does, not, require, advance, booking, but, it, is, less, recommended, during, the, rainy, season, due, to, potential, landslide, risks, the, paramount, pictures, film, secret, of, the, incas, 1954, with, charlton, heston, and, yma, sumac, was, filmed, on, location, at, cusco, and, machu, picchu, the, first, time, that, a, major, hollywood, studio, filmed, on, site, five, hundred, indigenous, people, were, hired, as, extras, in, the, film, the, opening, sequence, of, the, film, aguirre, the, wrath, of, god, 1972, was, shot, in, the, machu, picchu, area, and, on, the, stone, stairway, of, huayna,
