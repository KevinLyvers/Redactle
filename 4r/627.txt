titled, the, clansman, it, was, filmed, in, the, southern, united, states, and, directed, by, william, f, haddock, according, to, different, sources, the, ten, reel, film, was, either, completed, by, january, 1912, or, left, uncompleted, with, a, little, more, than, a, reel, of, footage, there, are, several, speculated, reasons, why, the, film, production, failed, including, unresolved, legal, issues, regarding, the, rights, to, the, story, financial, issues, problems, with, the, kinemacolor, process, and, poor, direction, frank, e, woods, the, films, scriptwriter, showed, his, work, to, griffith, who, was, inspired, to, create, his, own, film, adaptation, of, the, novel, titled, the, birth, of, a, nation, many, of, the, fictional, characters, in, the, film, are, based, on, real, historical, figures, abolitionist, u, s, representative, austin, stoneman, is, based, on, the, reconstruction, era, representative, thaddeus, stevens, of, pennsylvania, ben, cameron, is, modeled, after, leroy, mcafee, silas, lynch, was, modeled, after, alonzo, j, ransier, and, richard, howell, gleaves, after, the, failure, of, the, kinemacolor, project, in, which, dixon, was, willing, to, invest, his, own, money, 330, he, began, visiting, other, studios, to, see, if, they, were, interested, 421, in, late, 1913, dixon, met, the, film, producer, harry, aitken, who, was, interested, in, making, a, film, out, of, the, clansman, through, aitken, dixon, met, griffith, 421, like, dixon, griffith, was, a, southerner, a, fact, that, dixon, points, out, 295, griffith, s, father, served, as, a, colonel, in, the, confederate, states, army, and, like, dixon, viewed, reconstruction, negatively, griffith, believed, that, a, passage, from, the, clansman, where, klansmen, ride, to, the, rescue, of, persecuted, white, southerners, could, be, adapted, into, a, great, cinematic, sequence, griffith, first, announced, his, intent, to, adapt, dixon, s, play, to, gish, and, walthall, after, filming, home, sweet, home, in, 1914, birth, of, a, nation, follows, the, clansman, nearly, scene, by, scene, xvii, while, some, sources, also, credit, the, leopard, s, spots, as, source, material, russell, merritt, attributes, this, to, the, original, 1915, playbills, and, program, for, birth, which, eager, to, flaunt, the, film, s, literary, pedigree, cited, both, the, clansman, and, the, leopard, s, spots, as, sources, according, to, karen, crowe, here, is, not, a, single, event, word, character, or, circumstance, taken, from, the, leopard, s, spots, any, likenesses, between, the, film, and, the, leopard, s, spots, occur, because, some, similar, scenes, circumstances, and, characters, appear, in, both, books, xvii, xviii, griffith, agreed, to, pay, thomas, dixon, 10, 000, equivalent, to, 304, 186, in, 2023, for, the, rights, to, his, play, the, clansman, since, he, ran, out, of, money, and, could, afford, only, 2, 500, of, the, original, option, griffith, offered, dixon, 25, percent, interest, in, the, picture, dixon, reluctantly, agreed, and, the, unprecedented, success, of, the, film, made, him, rich, dixon, s, proceeds, were, the, largest, sum, any, author, had, received, for, a, motion, picture, story, and, amounted, to, several, million, dollars, the, american, historian, john, hope, franklin, suggested, that, many, aspects, of, the, script, for, the, birth, of, a, nation, appeared, to, reflect, dixon, s, concerns, more, than, griffith, s, as, dixon, had, an, obsession, in, his, novels, of, describing, in, loving, detail, the, lynchings, of, black, men, which, did, not, reflect, griffith, s, interests, 422, 423, griffith, began, filming, on, july, 4, 1914, and, was, finished, by, october, 1914, 421, some, filming, took, place, in, big, bear, lake, california, griffith, took, over, the, hollywood, studio, of, kinemacolor, west, point, engineers, provided, technical, advice, on, the, american, civil, war, battle, scenes, providing, griffith, with, the, artillery, used, in, the, film, much, of, the, filming, was, done, on, the, griffith, ranch, in, san, fernando, valley, with, the, petersburg, scenes, being, shot, at, what, is, today, forest, lawn, memorial, park, and, other, scenes, being, shot, in, whittier, and, ojai, valley, the, film, s, war, scenes, were, influenced, by, robert, underwood, johnson, s, book, battles, and, leaders, of, the, civil, war, harper, s, pictorial, history, of, the, civil, war, the, soldier, in, our, civil, war, and, mathew, brady, s, photography, many, of, the, african, americans, in, the, film, were, portrayed, by, white, actors, in, blackface, griffith, initially, claimed, this, was, deliberate, stating, on, careful, weighing, of, every, detail, concerned, the, decision, was, to, have, no, black, blood, among, the, principals, it, was, only, in, the, legislative, scene, that, negroes, were, used, and, then, only, as, extra, people, however, black, extras, who, had, been, housed, in, segregated, quarters, including, griffith, s, acquaintance, and, frequent, collaborator, madame, sul, te, wan, can, be, seen, in, many, other, shots, of, the, film, griffith, s, budget, started, at, us, 40, 000, equivalent, to, 1, 200, 000, in, 2023, but, rose, to, over, 100, 000, equivalent, to, 3, 010, 000, in, 2023, by, the, time, he, finished, filming, griffith, had, shot, approximately, 150, 000, feet, of, footage, approximately, 36, hours, of, film, which, he, edited, down, to, 13, 000, feet, just, over, 3, hours, the, film, was, edited, after, early, screenings, in, reaction, to, audience, reception, and, existing, prints, of, the, film, are, missing, footage, from, the, standard, version, of, the, film, evidence, exists, that, the, film, originally, included, scenes, of, white, slave, traders, seizing, blacks, from, west, africa, and, detaining, them, aboard, a, slave, ship, southern, congressmen, in, the, house, of, representatives, northerners, reacting, to, the, results, of, the, 1860, presidential, election, the, passage, of, the, fourteenth, amendment, a, union, league, meeting, depictions, of, martial, law, in, south, carolina, and, a, battle, sequence, in, addition, several, scenes, were, cut, at, the, insistence, of, new, york, mayor, john, purroy, mitchel, due, to, their, highly, racist, content, before, its, release, in, new, york, city, including, a, female, abolitionist, activist, recoiling, from, the, body, odor, of, a, black, boy, black, men, seizing, white, women, on, the, streets, of, piedmont, and, deportations, of, blacks, with, the, title, lincoln, s, solution, it, was, also, long, rumored, including, by, griffith, s, biographer, seymour, stern, that, the, original, film, included, a, rape, scene, between, gus, and, flora, before, her, suicide, but, in, 1974, the, cinematographer, karl, brown, denied, that, such, a, scene, had, been, filmed, although, the, birth, of, a, nation, is, commonly, regarded, as, a, landmark, for, its, dramatic, and, visual, innovations, its, use, of, music, was, arguably, no, less, revolutionary, though, film, was, still, silent, at, the, time, it, was, common, practice, to, distribute, musical, cue, sheets, or, less, commonly, full, scores, usually, for, organ, or, piano, accompaniment, along, with, each, print, of, a, film, for, the, birth, of, a, nation, composer, joseph, carl, breil, created, a, three, hour, long, musical, score, that, combined, all, three, types, of, music, in, use, at, the, time, adaptations, of, existing, works, by, classical, composers, new, arrangements, of, well, known, melodies, and, original, composed, music, though, it, had, been, specifically, composed, for, the, film, breil, s, score, was, not, used, for, the, february, 8, 1915, los, angeles, premi, re, of, the, film, at, clune, s, auditorium, rather, a, score, compiled, by, carli, elinor, was, performed, in, its, stead, and, this, score, was, used, exclusively, in, west, coast, showings, breil, s, score, was, not, used, until, the, film, debuted, in, new, york, at, the, liberty, theatre, but, it, was, the, score, featured, in, all, showings, save, those, on, the, west, coast, outside, of, original, compositions, breil, adapted, classical, music, for, use, in, the, film, including, passages, from, der, freisch, tz, by, carl, maria, von, weber, leichte, kavallerie, by, franz, von, supp, symphony, no, 6, by, ludwig, van, beethoven, and, ride, of, the, valkyries, by, richard, wagner, the, latter, used, as, a, leitmotif, during, the, ride, of, the, kkk, breil, also, arranged, several, traditional, and, popular, tunes, that, would, have, been, recognizable, to, audiences, at, the, time, including, many, southern, melodies, among, these, songs, were, maryland, my, maryland, dixie, old, folks, at, home, the, star, spangled, banner, america, the, beautiful, the, battle, hymn, of, the, republic, auld, lang, syne, and, where, did, you, get, that, hat, dj, spooky, has, called, breil, s, score, with, its, mix, of, dixieland, songs, classical, music, and, vernacular, heartland, music, an, early, pivotal, accomplishment, in, remix, culture, he, has, also, cited, breil, s, use, of, music, by, wagner, as, influential, on, subsequent, hollywood, films, including, star, wars, 1977, and, apocalypse, now, 1979, in, his, original, compositions, for, the, film, breil, wrote, numerous, leitmotifs, to, accompany, the, appearance, of, specific, characters, the, principal, love, theme, that, was, created, for, the, romance, between, elsie, stoneman, and, ben, cameron, was, published, as, the, perfect, song, and, is, regarded, as, the, first, marketed, theme, song, from, a, film, it, was, later, used, as, the, theme, song, for, the, popular, radio, and, television, sitcom, amos, n, andy, the, first, public, showing, of, the, film, then, called, the, clansman, was, on, january, 1, and, 2, 1915, at, the, loring, opera, house, in, riverside, california, the, second, night, it, was, sold, out, and, people, were, turned, away, it, was, shown, on, february, 8, 1915, to, an, audience, of, 3, 000, people, at, clune, s, auditorium, in, downtown, los, angeles, at, the, new, york, premiere, dixon, spoke, on, stage, when, the, interlude, started, halfway, through, the, film, reminding, the, audience, that, the, dramatic, version, of, the, clansman, appeared, in, that, venue, nine, years, previously, mr, dixon, also, observed, that, he, would, have, allowed, none, but, the, son, of, a, confederate, soldier, to, direct, the, film, version, of, the, clansman, the, film, s, backers, understood, that, the, film, needed, a, massive, publicity, campaign, if, they, were, to, cover, the, immense, cost, of, producing, it, a, major, part, of, this, campaign, was, the, release, of, the, film, in, a, roadshow, theatrical, release, this, allowed, griffith, to, charge, premium, prices, for, tickets, sell, souvenirs, and, build, excitement, around, the, film, before, giving, it, a, wide, release, for, several, months, griffith, s, team, traveled, to, various, cities, to, show, the, film, for, one, or, two, nights, before, moving, on, this, strategy, was, immensely, successful, dixon, had, seen, a, screening, of, the, film, for, an, invited, audience, in, new, york, in, early, 1915, when, the, title, was, still, the, clansmen, struck, by, the, power, of, the, film, he, told, griffith, that, the, clansmen, was, not, an, appropriate, title, and, suggested, that, it, be, changed, to, the, birth, of, a, nation, the, title, was, changed, before, the, march, 2, new, york, opening, 329, however, the, title, was, used, in, the, press, as, early, as, january, 2, 1915, while, it, was, still, referred, to, as, the, clansman, in, october, the, birth, of, a, nation, was, the, first, movie, shown, in, the, white, house, in, the, east, room, on, february, 18, 1915, an, earlier, movie, the, italian, cabiria, 1914, was, shown, on, the, lawn, it, was, attended, by, president, woodrow, wilson, members, of, his, family, and, members, of, his, cabinet, both, dixon, and, griffith, were, present, 126, as, put, by, dixon, not, an, impartial, source, it, repeated, the, triumph, of, the, first, showing, 299, there, is, dispute, about, wilson, s, attitude, toward, the, movie, a, newspaper, reported, that, he, received, many, letters, protesting, against, his, alleged, action, in, indorsing, the, pictures, including, a, letter, from, massachusetts, congressman, thomas, chandler, thacher, the, showing, of, the, movie, had, caused, several, near, riots, when, former, assistant, attorney, general, william, h, lewis, and, a, walters, a, bishop, of, the, african, methodist, episcopal, zion, church, called, at, the, white, house, to, add, their, protests, president, wilson, s, private, secretary, joseph, tumulty, showed, them, a, letter, he, had, written, to, thacher, on, wilson, s, behalf, according, to, the, letter, wilson, had, been, entirely, unaware, of, the, character, of, the, play, before, it, was, presented, and, has, at, no, time, expressed, his, approbation, of, it, its, exhibition, at, the, white, house, was, a, courtesy, extended, to, an, old, acquaintance, dixon, in, his, autobiography, quotes, wilson, as, saying, when, dixon, proposed, showing, the, movie, at, the, white, house, that, i, am, pleased, to, be, able, to, do, this, little, thing, for, you, because, a, long, time, ago, you, took, a, day, out, of, your, busy, life, to, do, something, for, me, 298, what, dixon, had, done, for, wilson, was, to, suggest, him, for, an, honorary, degree, which, wilson, received, from, dixon, s, alma, mater, wake, forest, college, 512, dixon, had, been, a, fellow, graduate, student, in, history, with, wilson, at, the, johns, hopkins, university, and, in, 1913, dedicated, his, historical, novel, about, lincoln, the, southerner, to, our, first, southern, born, president, since, lincoln, my, friend, and, collegemate, woodrow, wilson, the, evidence, that, wilson, knew, the, character, of, the, play, in, advance, of, seeing, it, is, circumstantial, but, very, strong, given, dixon, s, career, and, the, notoriety, attached, to, the, play, the, clansman, it, is, not, unreasonable, to, assume, that, wilson, must, have, had, some, idea, of, at, least, the, general, tenor, of, the, film, 513, the, movie, was, based, on, a, best, selling, novel, and, was, preceded, by, a, stage, version, play, which, was, received, with, protests, in, several, cities, in, some, cities, it, was, prohibited, and, received, a, great, deal, of, news, coverage, wilson, issued, no, protest, when, the, washington, evening, star, at, that, time, washington, d, c, s, newspaper, of, record, reported, in, advance, of, the, showing, in, language, suggesting, a, press, release, from, dixon, and, griffiths, that, dixon, was, a, schoolmate, of, president, wilson, and, is, an, intimate, friend, and, that, wilson, s, interest, in, it, is, due, to, the, great, lesson, of, peace, it, teaches, wilson, and, only, wilson, is, quoted, by, name, in, the, movie, for, his, observations, on, american, history, and, the, title, of, wilson, s, book, history, of, the, american, people, is, mentioned, as, well, 518, 519, the, three, title, cards, with, quotations, from, wilson, s, book, read, adventurers, swarmed, out, of, the, north, as, much, the, enemies, of, one, race, as, of, the, other, to, cozen, beguile, and, use, the, negroes, in, the, villages, the, negroes, were, the, office, holders, men, who, knew, none, of, the, uses, of, authority, except, its, insolences, the, policy, of, the, congressional, leaders, wrought, a, veritable, overthrow, of, civilization, in, the, south, in, their, determination, to, put, the, white, south, under, the, heel, of, the, black, south, the, white, men, were, roused, by, a, mere, instinct, of, self, preservation, until, at, last, there, had, sprung, into, existence, a, great, ku, klux, klan, a, veritable, empire, of, the, south, to, protect, the, southern, country, in, the, same, book, wilson, has, harsh, words, about, the, abyss, between, the, original, goals, of, the, klan, and, that, into, which, it, evolved, dixon, has, been, accused, of, misquoting, wilson, 518, in, 1937, a, popular, magazine, reported, that, wilson, said, of, the, film, it, is, like, writing, history, with, lightning, and, my, only, regret, is, that, it, is, all, so, terribly, true, wilson, over, the, years, had, several, times, used, the, metaphor, of, illuminating, history, as, if, by, lightning, and, he, may, well, have, said, it, at, the, time, the, accuracy, of, his, saying, it, was, terribly, true, is, disputed, by, historians, there, is, no, contemporary, documentation, of, the, remark, 521, vachel, lindsay, a, popular, poet, of, the, time, is, known, to, have, referred, to, the, film, as, art, by, lightning, flash, the, next, day, february, 19, 1915, griffith, and, dixon, held, a, showing, of, the, film, in, the, raleigh, hotel, ballroom, which, they, had, hired, for, the, occasion, early, that, morning, dixon, called, on, a, north, carolina, friend, josephus, daniels, secretary, of, the, navy, daniels, set, up, a, meeting, that, morning, for, dixon, with, edward, douglass, white, chief, justice, of, the, supreme, court, initially, justice, white, was, not, interested, in, seeing, the, film, but, when, dixon, told, him, it, was, the, true, story, of, reconstruction, and, the, klan, s, role, in, saving, the, south, white, recalling, his, youth, in, louisiana, jumped, to, attention, and, said, i, was, a, member, of, the, klan, sir, 171, 172, with, white, agreeing, to, see, the, film, the, rest, of, the, supreme, court, followed, in, addition, to, the, entire, supreme, court, in, the, audience, were, many, members, of, congress, and, members, of, the, diplomatic, corps, the, secretary, of, the, navy, 38, members, of, the, senate, and, about, 50, members, of, the, house, of, representatives, the, audience, of, 600, cheered, and, applauded, throughout, 425, in, griffith, s, words, the, showings, to, the, president, and, the, entire, supreme, court, conferred, an, honor, upon, birth, of, a, nation, dixon, and, griffith, used, this, commercially, the, following, day, griffith, and, dixon, transported, the, film, to, new, york, city, for, review, by, the, national, board, of, censorship, they, presented, the, film, as, endorsed, by, the, president, and, the, cream, of, washington, society, the, board, approved, the, film, by, 15, to, 8, 127, a, warrant, to, close, the, theater, in, which, the, movie, was, to, open, was, dismissed, after, a, long, distance, call, to, the, white, house, confirmed, that, the, film, had, been, shown, there, 303, 173, justice, white, was, very, angry, when, advertising, for, the, film, stated, that, he, approved, it, and, he, threatened, to, denounce, it, publicly, 519, dixon, a, racist, and, white, supremacist, clearly, was, rattled, and, upset, by, criticism, by, african, americans, that, the, movie, encouraged, hatred, against, them, and, he, wanted, the, endorsement, of, as, many, powerful, men, as, possible, to, offset, such, criticism, dixon, always, vehemently, denied, having, anti, black, prejudices, despite, the, way, his, books, promoted, white, supremacy, and, stated, my, books, are, hard, reading, for, a, negro, and, yet, the, negroes, in, denouncing, them, are, unwittingly, denouncing, one, of, their, greatest, friends, 424, in, a, letter, sent, on, may, 1, 1915, to, joseph, p, tumulty, wilson, s, secretary, dixon, wrote, the, real, purpose, of, my, film, was, to, revolutionize, northern, sentiments, by, a, presentation, of, history, that, would, transform, every, man, in, the, audience, into, a, good, democrat, every, man, who, comes, out, of, the, theater, is, a, southern, partisan, for, life, 430, in, a, letter, to, president, wilson, sent, on, september, 5, 1915, dixon, boasted, this, play, is, transforming, the, entire, population, of, the, north, and, the, west, into, sympathetic, southern, voters, there, will, never, be, an, issue, of, your, segregation, policy, 430, dixon, was, alluding, to, the, fact, that, wilson, upon, becoming, president, in, 1913, had, allowed, cabinet, members, to, impose, segregation, on, federal, workplaces, in, washington, d, c, by, reducing, the, number, of, black, employees, through, demotion, or, dismissal, one, famous, part, of, the, film, was, added, by, griffith, only, on, the, second, run, of, the, film, and, is, missing, from, most, online, versions, of, the, film, presumably, taken, from, first, run, prints, these, are, the, second, and, third, of, three, opening, title, cards, that, defend, the, film, the, added, titles, read, a, plea, for, the, art, of, the, motion, picture, we, do, not, fear, censorship, for, we, have, no, wish, to, offend, with, improprieties, or, obscenities, but, we, do, demand, as, a, right, the, liberty, to, show, the, dark, side, of, wrong, that, we, may, illuminate, the, bright, side, of, virtue, the, same, liberty, that, is, conceded, to, the, art, of, the, written, word, that, art, to, which, we, owe, the, bible, and, the, works, of, shakespeare, and, if, in, this, work, we, have, conveyed, to, the, mind, the, ravages, of, war, to, the, end, that, war, may, be, held, in, abhorrence, this, effort, will, not, have, been, in, vain, various, film, historians, have, expressed, a, range, of, views, about, these, titles, to, nicholas, andrew, miller, this, shows, that, griffith, s, greatest, achievement, in, the, birth, of, a, nation, was, that, he, brought, the, cinema, s, capacity, for, spectacle, under, the, rein, of, an, outdated, but, comfortably, literary, form, of, historical, narrative, griffith, s, models, are, not, the, pioneers, of, film, spectacle, but, the, giants, of, literary, narrative, on, the, other, hand, s, kittrell, rushing, complains, about, griffith, s, didactic, title, cards, while, stanley, corkin, complains, that, griffith, masks, his, idea, of, fact, in, the, rhetoric, of, high, art, and, free, expression, and, creates, a, film, that, erodes, the, very, ideal, of, liberty, that, he, asserts, studies, have, linked, the, film, to, greater, support, for, the, kkk, glorifying, the, klan, to, approving, white, audiences, the, film, became, a, national, cultural, phenomenon, merchandisers, made, ku, klux, hats, and, kitchen, aprons, and, ushers,

massive, klan, themed, party, when, the, film, was, released, riots, broke, out, in, philadelphia, and, other, major, cities, in, the, united, states, the, film, s, inflammatory, nature, was, a, catalyst, for, gangs, of, white, people, to, attack, black, people, on, april, 24, 1916, the, chicago, american, reported, that, a, white, man, murdered, a, black, teenager, in, lafayette, indiana, after, seeing, the, film, although, there, has, been, some, controversy, as, to, whether, the, murderer, had, actually, seen, the, birth, of, a, nation, over, a, century, later, a, harvard, university, research, paper, found, that, n, average, lynchings, in, a, county, rose, fivefold, in, the, month, after, arrived, the, mayor, of, cedar, rapids, iowa, was, the, first, of, twelve, mayors, to, ban, the, film, in, 1915, out, of, concern, that, it, would, promote, race, prejudice, after, meeting, with, a, delegation, of, black, citizens, the, naacp, set, up, a, precedent, setting, national, boycott, of, the, film, likely, seen, as, the, most, successful, effort, additionally, they, organized, a, mass, demonstration, when, the, film, was, screened, in, boston, and, it, was, banned, in, three, states, and, several, cities, a, 2023, study, found, that, roadshow, screenings, of, the, film, were, associated, with, a, sharp, spike, in, lynchings, and, race, riots, between, 1915, and, 1920, the, new, york, times, gave, the, film, a, quite, brief, review, calling, it, melodramatic, and, inflammatory, adding, that, a, great, deal, might, be, said, concerning, the, spirit, revealed, in, mr, dixon, s, review, of, the, unhappy, chapter, of, reconstruction, and, concerning, the, sorry, service, rendered, by, its, plucking, at, old, wounds, variety, praised, griffith, s, direction, claiming, he, set, such, a, pace, it, will, take, a, long, time, before, one, will, come, along, that, can, top, it, in, point, of, production, acting, photography, and, direction, every, bit, of, the, film, was, laid, played, and, made, in, america, one, may, find, some, flaws, in, the, general, running, of, the, picture, but, they, are, so, small, and, insignificant, that, the, bigness, and, greatness, of, the, entire, film, production, itself, completely, crowds, out, any, little, defects, that, might, be, singled, out, burns, mantle, in, the, new, york, daily, news, noted, an, element, of, excitement, that, swept, a, sophisticated, audience, like, a, prairie, fire, in, a, high, wind, while, the, new, york, tribune, said, it, was, a, spectacular, drama, with, thrills, piled, upon, thrills, the, new, republic, however, called, it, aggressively, vicious, and, defamatory, that, was, a, spiritual, assassination, it, degrades, the, censors, that, passed, it, and, the,

the, end, of, 1917, epoch, reported, to, its, shareholders, cumulative, receipts, of, 4, 8, million, and, griffith, s, own, records, put, epoch, s, worldwide, earnings, from, the, film, at, 5, 2, million, as, of, 1919, although, the, distributor, s, share, of, the, revenue, at, this, time, was, much, lower, than, the, exhibition, gross, in, the, biggest, cities, epoch, negotiated, with,

both, before, and, after, its, premiere, dixon, who, believed, the, film, to, be, entirely, truthful, and, historically, accurate, attributed, this, to, sectionalists, i, e, non, southerners, who, in, dixon, s, opinion, were, hostile, to, the, truth, about, the, south, 301, 303, it, was, to, counter, these, sinister, forces, and, the, dangerous, menace, that, dixon, and, griffith, sought, the, backing, of, president, wilson, and, the, supreme, court, 296, the, national, association, for, the, advancement, of, colored, people, naacp, protested, at, premieres, of, the, film, in, numerous, cities, according, to, the, historian, david, copeland, by, the, time, of, the, movie, s, march, 3, premiere, in, new, york, city, its, subject, matter, had, embroiled, the, film, in, charges, of, racism, protests, and, calls, for, censorship, which, began, after, the, los, angeles, branch, of, the, naacp, requested, the, city, s, film, board, ban, the, movie, since, film, boards, were, composed, almost, entirely, of, whites, few, review, boards, initially, banned, griffith, s, picture, the, naacp, also, conducted, a, public, education, campaign, publishing, articles, protesting, the, film, s, fabrications, and, inaccuracies, organizing, petitions, against, it, and, conducting, education, on, the, facts, of, the, war, and, reconstruction, because, of, the, lack, of, success,

of, the, or, indifferent, to, it, jane, addams, an, american, social, worker, and, social, reformer, and, the, founder, of, hull, house, voiced, her, reaction, to, the, film, in, an, interview, published, by, the, new, york, post, on, march, 13, 1915, just, ten, days, after, the, film, was, released, she, stated, that, one, of, the, most, unfortunate, things, about, this, film, is, that, it, appeals, to, race, prejudice, upon, the, basis, of, conditions, of, half, a, century, ago, which, have, nothing, to, do, with, the, facts, we, have, to, consider, to, day, even, then, it, does, not, tell, the, whole, truth, it, is, claimed, that, the, play, is, historical, but, history, is, easy, to, misuse, in, new, york, rabbi, stephen, samuel, wise, told, the, press, after, seeing, the, birth, of, a, nation, that, the, film, was, an, indescribable, foul, and, loathsome, libel, on, a, race, of, human, beings, 426, in, boston, booker, t, washington, wrote, a, newspaper, column, asking, readers, to, boycott, the, film, 426, while, the, civil, rights, activist, william, monroe, trotter, organized, demonstrations, against, the, film, which, he, predicted, was, going, to, worsen, race, relations, on, saturday, april, 10, and, again, on, april, 17, trotter, and, a, group, of, other, blacks, tried, to, buy, tickets, for, the, show, s, premiere, at, the, tremont, theater, and, were,

birth, of, a, nation, in, a, letter, to, the, new, york, globe, griffith, wrote, that, his, film, was, an, influence, against, the, intermarriage, of, blacks, and, whites, dixon, likewise, called, the, naacp, the, negro, intermarriage, society, and, said, it, was, against, the, birth, of, a, nation, for, one, reason, only, because, it, opposes, the, marriage, of, blacks, to, whites, griffith, indignant, at, the, film, s, negative, critical, reception, wrote, letters, to, newspapers, and, published, a, pamphlet, in, which, he, accused, his, critics, of, censoring, unpopular, opinions, when, sherwin, lewis, of, the, new, york, globe, wrote, a, piece, that, expressed, criticism, of, the, film, s, distorted, portrayal, of, history, and, said, that, it, was, not, worthy, of, constitutional, protection, because, its, purpose, was, to, make, a, few, dirty, dollars, griffith, responded, that, the, public, should, not, be, afraid, to, accept, the, truth, even, though, it, might, not, like, it, he, also, added, that, the, man, who, wrote, the, editorial, was, damaging, my, reputation, as, a, producer, and, a, liar, and, a, coward, the, birth, of, a, nation, was, very, popular, despite, the, film, s, controversy, it, was, unlike, anything, that, american, audiences, had, ever, seen, before, the, los, angeles, times, called, it, the, greatest, picture, ever, made, and, the, greatest,

henry, parkhurst, argued, that, the, film, was, not, racist, saying, that, it, was, exactly, true, to, history, by, depicting, freedmen, as, they, were, and, therefore, it, was, a, compliment, to, the, black, man, by, showing, how, far, black, people, had, advanced, since, reconstruction, critic, dolly, dalrymple, wrote, that, when, i, saw, it, it, was, far, from, silent, incessant, murmurs, of, approval, roars, of, laughter, gasps, of, anxiety, and, outbursts, of, applause, greeted, every, new, picture, on, the, screen, one, man, viewing, the, film, was, so, moved, by, the, scene, where,

love, and, it, s, that, very, conflict, that, renders, the, film, all, the, more, despicable, the, experience, of, the, film, more, of, a, torment, together, with, the, acknowledgment, that, griffith, whose, short, films, for, biograph, were, already, among, the, treasures, of, world, cinema, yoked, his, mighty, talent, to, the, cause, of, hatred, which, still, worse, he, sincerely, depicted, as, virtuous, brody, also, argued, that, griffith, unintentionally, undercut, his, own, thesis, in, the, film, citing, the, scene, before, the, civil, war, when, the, cameron, family, offers, up, lavish, hospitality, to, the, stoneman, family, who, travel, past, mile, after, mile, of, slaves, working, the, cotton, fields, of, south, carolina, to, reach, the, cameron, home, brody, maintained, that, a, modern, audience, can, see, that, the, wealth, of, the, camerons, comes, from, the, slaves, forced, to, do, back, breaking, work, picking, the, cotton, likewise, brody, argued, that, the, scene, where, people, in, south, carolina, celebrate, the, confederate, victory, at, the, battle, of, bull, run, by, dancing, around, the, eerie, flare, of, a, bonfire, implies, a, dance, of, death, foreshadowing, the, destruction, of, sherman, s, march, that, was, to, come, in, the, same, way, brody, wrote, that, the, scene, where, the, klan, dumps, gus, s, body, off, at, the, doorstep, of, lynch, is, meant, to, have, the, audience, cheering, but, modern, audiences, find, the, scene, obscene, and, horrifying, finally, brody, argued, that, the, end, of, the, film, where, the, klan, prevents, defenseless, african, americans, from, exercising, their, right, to, vote, by, pointing, guns, at, them, today, seems, unjust, and, cruel, in, an, article, for, the, atlantic, film, critic, ty, burr, deemed, the, birth, of, a, nation, the, most, influential, film, in, history, while, criticizing, its, portrayal, of, black, men, as, savage, richard, corliss, of, time, wrote, that, griffith, established, in, the, hundreds, of, one, and, two, reelers, he, directed, a, cinematic, textbook, a, fully, formed, visual, language, for, the, generations, that, followed, more, than, anyone, else, more, than, all, others, combined, he, invented, the, film, art, he, brought, it, to, fruition, in, the, birth, of, a, nation, corliss, praised, the, film, s, brilliant, storytelling, technique, and, noted, that, the, birth, of, a, nation, is, nearly, as, antiwar, as, it, is, antiblack, the, civil, war, scenes, which, consume, only, 30, minutes, of, the, extravaganza, emphasize, not, the, national, glory, but, the, human, cost, of, combat, griffith, may, have, been, a, racist, politically, but, his, refusal, to, find, uplift, in, the, south, s, war, against, the, union, and, implicitly, in, any, war, at, all, reveals, him, as, a, cinematic, humanist, in, 1992, the, u, s, library, of, congress, deemed, the, film, culturally, historically, or, aesthetically, significant, and, selected, it, for, preservation, in, the, national, film, registry, the, american, film, institute, recognized, the, film, by, ranking, it, 44, within, the, afi, s, 100, years, 100, movies, list, in, 1998, the, film, remains, controversial, due, to, its, interpretation, of, american, history, university, of, houston, historian, steven, mintz, summarizes, its, message, as, follows, reconstruction, was, an, unmitigated, disaster, african, americans, could, never, be, integrated, into, white, society, as, equals, and, the, violent, actions, of, the, ku, klux, klan, were, justified, to, reestablish, honest, government, the, south, is, portrayed, as, a, victim, the, first, overt, mentioning, of, the, war, is, the, scene, in, which, abraham, lincoln, signs, the, call, for, the, first, 75, 000, volunteers, however, the, first, aggression, in, the, civil, war, made, when, the, confederate, troops, fired, on, fort, sumter, in, 1861, is, not, mentioned, in, the, film, the, film, suggested, that, the, ku, klux, klan, restored, order, to, the, postwar, south, which, was, depicted, as, endangered, by, abolitionists, freedmen, and, carpetbagging, republican, politicians, from, the, north, this, is, similar, to, the, dunning, school, of, historiography, which, was, current, in, academe, at, the, time, the, film, is, slightly, less, extreme, than, the, books, upon, which, it, is, based, in, which, dixon, misrepresented, reconstruction, as, a, nightmarish, time, when, black, men, ran, amok, storming, into, weddings, to, rape, white, women, with, impunity, the, film, portrayed, president, abraham, lincoln, as, a, friend, of, the, south, and, refers, to, him, as, the, great, heart, the, two, romances, depicted, in, the, film, phil, stoneman, with, margaret, cameron, and, ben, cameron, with, elsie, stoneman, reflect, griffith, s, retelling, of, history, the, couples, are, used, as, a, metaphor, representing, the, film, s, broader, message, of, the, need, for, the, reconciliation, of, the, north, and, south, to, defend, white, supremacy, among, both, couples, there, is, an, attraction, that, forms, before, the, war, stemming, from, the, friendship, between, their, families, with, the, war, however, both, families, are, split, apart, and, their, losses, culminate, in, the, end, of, the, war, with, the, defense, of, white, supremacy, one, of, the, intertitles, clearly, sums, up, the, message, of, unity, the, former, enemies, of, north, and, south, are, united, again, in, defense, of, their, aryan, birthright, the, film, further, reinforced, the, popular, belief, held, by, whites, especially, in, the, south, of, reconstruction, as, a, disaster, in, his, 1929, book, the, tragic, era, the, revolution, after, lincoln, claude, bowers, treated, the, birth, of, a, nation, as, a, factually, accurate, account, of, reconstruction, 432, in, the, tragic, era, bowers, presented, every, black, politician, in, the, south, as, corrupt, portrayed, republican, representative, thaddeus, stevens, as, a, vicious, race, traitor, intent, upon, making, blacks, the, equal, of, whites, and, praised, the, klan, for, saving, civilization, in, the, south, 432, bowers, wrote, about, black, empowerment, that, the, worst, sort, of, scum, from, the, north, like, stevens, inflamed, the, negro, s, egoism, and, soon, the, lustful, assaults, began, rape, was, the, foul, daughter, of, reconstruction, 432, historian, e, merton, coulter, treated, the, birth, of, a, nation, as, historically, correct, and, painted, a, vivid, picture, of, black, beasts, running, amok, encouraged, by, alcohol, sodden, corrupt, and, vengeful, black, republican, politicians, 432, veteran, film, reviewer, roger, ebert, wrote, stung, by, criticisms, that, the, second, half, of, his, masterpiece, was, racist, in, its, glorification, of, the, ku, klux, klan, and, its, brutal, images, of, blacks, griffith, tried, to, make, amends, in, intolerance, 1916, which, criticized, prejudice, and, in, broken, blossoms, he, told, perhaps, the, first, interracial, love, story, in, the, movies, even, though, to, be, sure, it, s, an, idealized, love, with, no, touching, despite, some, similarities, between, the, congressman, stoneman, character, and, rep, thaddeus, stevens, of, pennsylvania, rep, stevens, did, not, have, the, family, members, described, and, did, not, move, to, south, carolina, during, reconstruction, he, died, in, washington, d, c, in, 1868, however, stevens, s, biracial, housekeeper, lydia, hamilton, smith, was, considered, his, common, law, wife, and, was, generously, provided, for, in, his, will, in, the, film, abraham, lincoln, is, portrayed, in, a, positive, light, due, to, his, belief, in, conciliatory, postwar, policies, toward, southern, whites, the, president, s, views, are, opposite, those, of, austin, stoneman, a, character, presented, in, a, negative, light, who, acts, as, an, antagonist, the, assassination, of, lincoln, marks, the, transition, from, war, to, reconstruction, each, of, which, periods, has, one, of, the, two, acts, of, the, film, in, including, the, assassination, the, film, also, establishes, to, the, audience, that, the, plot, of, the, movie, has, historical, basis, franklin, wrote, the, film, s, depiction, of, reconstruction, as, a, hellish, time, when, black, freedmen, ran, amok, raping, and, killing, whites, with, impunity, until, the, klan, stepped, in, is, not, supported, by, the, facts, instead, most, freed, slaves, continued, to, work, for, their, former, masters, in, reconstruction, for, the, want, of, a, better, alternative, and, though, relations, between, freedmen, and, their, former, masters, were, not, friendly, very, few, freedmen, sought, revenge, against, the, people, who, had, enslaved, them, 427, 428, the, depictions, of, mass, klan, paramilitary, actions, did, not, have, historical, equivalents, however, there, were, incidents, in, 1871, where, klan, groups, traveled, from, other, areas, in, fairly, large, numbers, to, aid, localities, in, disarming, local, companies, of, the, all, black, portion, of, the, state, militia, and, the, organized, klan, continued, activities, as, small, groups, of, night, riders, the, civil, rights, movement, of, the, 1960s, inspired, a, new, generation, of, historians, such, as, scholar, eric, foner, who, led, a, reassessment, of, reconstruction, building, on, w, e, b, dubois, work, but, also, adding, new, sources, they, focused, on, achievements, of, the, african, american, and, white, republican, coalitions, such, as, establishment, of, universal, public, education, and, charitable, institutions, in, the, south, and, extension, of, voting, rights, to, black, men, in, response, the, southern, dominated, democratic, party, and, its, affiliated, white, militias, used, extensive, terrorism, intimidation, and, even, assassinations, to, suppress, african, american, leaders, and, voters, in, the, 1870s, and, thereby, to, regain, power, in, the, south, in, his, review, of, the, birth, of, a, nation, in, 1001, movies, you, must, see, before, you, die, jonathan, kline, writes, that, with, countless, artistic, innovations, griffith, essentially, created, contemporary, film, language, virtually, every, film, is, beholden, to, in, one, way, shape, or, form, griffith, introduced, the, use, of, dramatic, close, ups, tracking, shots, and, other, expressive, camera, movements, parallel, action, sequences, crosscutting, and, other, editing, techniques, he, added, that, the, fact, that, the, birth, of, a, nation, remains, respected, and, studied, to, this, day, despite, its, subject, matter, reveals, its, lasting, importance, griffith, pioneered, such, camera, techniques, as, close, ups, fade, outs, and, a, carefully, staged, battle, sequence, with, hundreds, of, extras, made, to, look, like, thousands, the, birth, of, a, nation, also, contained, many, new, artistic, techniques, such, as, color, tinting, for, dramatic, purposes, building, up, the, plot, to, an, exciting, climax, dramatizing, history, alongside, fiction, and, featuring, its, own, musical, score, written, for, an, orchestra, for, many, years, the, birth, of, a, nation, was, poorly, represented, in, home, media, and, restorations, this, stemmed, from, several, factors, one, of, which, was, the, fact, that, griffith, and, others, had, frequently, reworked, the, film, leaving, no, definitive, version, according, to, the, silent, film, website, brenton, film, many, home, media, releases, of, the, film, consisted, of, poor, quality, dvds, with, different, edits, scores, running, speeds, which, were, usually, in, definitely, unoriginal, black, and, white, one, of, the,
