synopsis, for, a, film, titled, les, millions, d, arlequin, which, had, characters, similar, to, those, in, the, rules, of, the, game, when, conceiving, the, film, renoir, was, inspired, by, classical, french, art, such, as, the, works, of, pierre, de, marivaux, pierre, augustin, caron, de, beaumarchais, and, especially, alfred, de, musset, s, play, les, caprices, de, marianne, which, renoir, initially, intended, to, adapt, nef, first, announced, the, film, as, an, adaptation, of, it, renoir, later, said, he, never, intended, to, directly, adapt, les, caprices, de, marianne, but, only, to, re, read, it, and, other, classics, of, french, literature, for, inspiration, after, returning, from, lecturing, in, london, in, january, 1939, renoir, left, paris, to, work, on, a, script, he, told, a, reporter, that, his, next, film, would, be, a, precise, description, of, the, bourgeois, of, our, age, renoir, carl, koch, and, zwoboda, went, to, marlotte, to, work, on, the, script,

his, ambition, when, i, made, the, film, was, to, illustrate, this, remark, we, are, dancing, on, a, volcano, renoir, called, the, film, a, divertissement, for, its, use, of, baroque, music, and, aspects, of, classical, french, comedies, renoir, s, initial, inspiration, by, les, caprices, de, marianne, led, to, the, film, s, four, main, characters, correlating, with, those, of, the, play, a, virtuous, wife, a, jealous, husband, a, despairing, lover, and, an, interceding, friend, in, both, the, play, and, the, film, the, interceding, friend, is, named, octave, octave, is, also, the, only, one, of, the, four, characters, inspired, by, the, play, that, shares, traits, with, its, counterpart, in, both, works, octave, is, a, sad, clown, full, of, self, doubt, and, self, pity, the, characters, names, constantly, changed, between, versions, of, the, script, renoir, said, that, in, an, early, draft, andr, jurieux, was, an, orchestra, conductor, rather, than, an, aviator, renoir, originally, wanted, the, entire, cast, of, la, b, te, humaine, including, fernand, ledoux, simone, simon, jean, gabin, and, julien, carette, for, the, film, gabin, was, offered, the, role, of, andr,

gaston, modot, claude, dauphin, was, offered, the, role, of, the, marquis, de, la, chesnaye, he, refused, it, and, instead, acted, with, simon, in, raymond, bernard, s, cavalcade, d, amour, renoir, then, cast, marcel, dalio, as, the, marquis, years, later, dalio, asked, renoir, why, he, had, been, cast, after, having, typically, played, burlesque, or, traitorous, roles, renoir, told, dalio, that, he, was, the, opposite, of, the, clich, of, what, a, marquis, was, and, that, dalio, was, the, only, actor, he, knew, that, could, portray, the, character, s, insecurity, renoir, s, brother, pierre, was, cast, as, octave, and, carette, was, cast, as, marceau, fran, ois, suggested, newly, famous, stage, actress, michele, alfa, for, the, role, of, christine, and, renoir, went, with, his, common, law, wife, marguerite, and, zwoboda, to, see, her, perform, in, a, play, while, at, the, play, renoir, noticed, nora, gregor, in, a, box, seat, in, the, audience, and, asked, about, her, during, the, intermission, he, learned, that, gregor, was, the, wife, of, prince, ernst, r, diger, von, starhemberg, an, austrian, nobleman, renoir, became, friends, with, gregor, and, her, husband, getting, to, know, them, over, several, dinners, in, paris, starhemberg, was, forced, to, resign, his, leadership, role, in, the, heimwehr, a, paramilitary, fascist, party, because, gregor, was, jewish, and, he, was, anti, fascist, when, germany, annexed, austria, in, march, 1938, gregor, and, starhemberg, fled, to, france, renoir, said, they, were, in, a, state, of, great, disarray, everything, they, believed, in, was, collapsing, gregor, was, an, actress, from, the, viennese, burgtheater, and, had, appeared, in, some, films, including, carl, theodor, dreyer, s, michael, gregor, s, first, husband, had, been, the, concert, pianist, mitja, nikisch, son, of, the, renowned, conductor, arthur, nikisch, of, the, leipzig, opera, and, according, to, film, theorist, charles, drazin, a, possible, inspiration, for, some, characteristics, of, octave, despite, objections, from, his, nef, colleagues, renoir, hired, gregor, for, the, role, of, christine, she, was, older, than, the, original, character, and, he, made, changes, to, the, character, based, on, gregor, s, personality, and, on, their, dinner, conversations, such, as, making, christine, the, daughter, of, an, austrian, conductor, many, of, renoir, s, friends, believed, he, fell, in, love, with, gregor, shortly, after, casting, her, zwoboda, said, gregor, had, that, which, renoir, loved, above, all, an, incontestable, class, a, style, the, gestures, and, bearing, of, a, great, distinction, renoir, said, he, cast, gregor, because, of, her, austrian, accent, which, he, believed, would, create, a, little, barrier, between, her, and, her, surroundings, and, because, of, her, appearance, which, he, considered, birdlike, and, sincere, renoir, finished, casting, the, remaining, roles, by, late, january, 1939, when, asked, who, the, main, character, of, the, film, was, renoir, answered, there, isn, t, any, my, conception, at, the, beginning, and, at, the, end, was, to, make, a, film, d, ensemble, a, film, representing, a, society, a, group, of, persons, almost, a, whole, class, and, not, a, film, of, personal, affairs, filming, for, exterior, scenes, set, in, the, country, began, on, february, 15, 1939, in, sologne, and, outside, the, chateau, de, la, fert, saint, aubin, renoir, later, said, he, chose, sologne, because, his, father, pierre, auguste, renoir, regretted, that, he, had, never, been, able, to, paint, how, well, i, understand, the, sincerity, of, those, regrets, before, these, beautiful, landscapes, of, sologne, in, astonishing, colors, of, a, grace, so, melancholy, yet, so, gentle, renoir, said, sologne, s, mist, took, me, back, to, the, happy, days, of, my, childhood, the, cast, and, crew, arrived, in, sologne, between, february, 6, and, 15, renoir,

tony, corteggiani, was, hired, as, a, technical, advisor, for, the, rabbit, hunting, sequence, the, cast, and, crew, stayed, at, hotel, rat, in, lamotte, beuvron, heavy, rainfall, prevented, the, start, of, shooting, in, sologne, for, several, weeks, and, renoir, rewrote, parts, of, the, script, to, accommodate, the, rain, while, he, finished, the, script, the, entire, company, played, cards, and, bonded, they, described, it, as, a, happy, time, in, their, lives, just, before, the, horrors, of, world, war, ii, began, paulette, dubost, said, shooting, the, film, was, great, fun, the, delays, caused, pierre, renoir, to, pull, out, of, the, film, because, of, prior, commitments, to, stage, plays, in, paris, renoir, then, asked, michel, simon, to, play, octave, but, simon, was, busy, with, other, projects, renoir, finally, cast, himself, later, saying, that, he, was, just, waiting, for, the, moment, when, pierre, would, say, why, don, t, you, play, the, role, yourself, jean, he, didn, t, have, to, ask, me, twice, he, added, that, after, having, gained, experience, and, confidence, as, a, director, his, most, stubborn, dream, has, been, to, be, an, actor, renoir, rewrote, the, role, of, octave, to, better, suit, himself, since, he, and, pierre, were, physically, and, personally, very, different, to, raise, additional, funding, for, the, over, running, production, zwoboda, had, used, the, success, of, la, b, te, humaine, to, sell, advanced, screening, rights, in, large, theatres, to, jean, jay, the, director, of, the, gaumont, film, company, when, shooting, in, sologne, finally, began, progress, was, slow, because, of, the, constant, improvisations, of, the, actors, which, renoir, encouraged, and, gregor, s, struggles, with, her, role, jay, visited, the, set, and, was, unhappy, with, the, slow, progress, and, with, renoir, s, performance, the, cast, and, crew, however, admired, renoir, and, enjoyed, the, carefree, atmosphere, on, set, forgetting, about, the, impending, political, situation, the, cast, s, improvisations, caused, some, changes, from, the, original, script, christine, was, initially, written, as, a, bored, upper, class, bourgeois, whose, main, preoccupation, was, planning, parties, but, renoir, amended, this, to, accommodate, gregor, s, acting, renoir, also, cut, most, of, the, references, to, christine, s, conductor, father, stiller, such, as, his, relationship, with, the, marquis, the, marquis, was, initially, written, as, a, patron, of, the, arts, and, music, instead, of, a, collector, of, music, boxes, journalists, often, visited, the, set, and, wrote, positively, about, the, production, the, film, was, shot, almost, chronologically, in, sologne, and, again, in, joinville, val, de, marne, which, renoir, considered, important, for, the, actors, performances, renoir, said, he, did, not, need, to, do, much, directing, since, the, actors, were, so, involved, in, their, roles, when, directing, himself, renoir, arranged, the, performers, movements, first, then, acted, in, the, scenes, jay, pushed, renoir, to, finish, filming, in, sologne, and, move, the, production, to, sets, erected, at, the, path, studios, in, joinville, renoir, finally, agreed, and, left, zwoboda, corteggiani, and, cartier, bresson, in, sologne, to, shoot, b, roll, footage, of, the, rabbit, hunting, sequence, hundreds, of, animals, were, killed, during, filming, and, local, people, were, used, as, stand, ins, for, the, actors, filming, on, the, sets, in, joinville, continued, at, a, slow, pace, renoir, would, often, film, fifteen, to, twenty, takes, of, individual, shots, and, change, dialogue, on, the, set, making, previous, takes, useless, film, historian, joel, finler, said, the, film, truly, evolved, during, its, making, as, renoir, worked, on, writing, and, rewriting, the, script, balancing, and, rebalancing, the, characters, and, relationships, plots, and, subplots, cartier, bresson, said, the, improvisation, during, filming, was, like, a, jam, session, both, cast, and, crew, members, were, encouraged, to, suggest, ideas, and, dialogue, would, often, change, on, the, morning, of, the, shoot,

and, mila, par, ly, film, historian, gerald, mast, found, gregor, s, performance, to, be, as, haunting, and, bewitching, as, a, plastic, giraffe, during, production, jay, told, renoir, he, hated, his, performance, as, octave, renoir, offered, to, replace, himself, with, michel, simon, but, jay, refused, because, two, thirds, of, the, film, had, already, been, shot, jay, asked, renoir, to, instead,

screening, fought, and, one, person, tried, to, set, fire, to, the, theater, renoir, said, he, depicted, pleasant, sympathetic, characters, but, showed, them, in, a, society, in, the, process, of, disintegration, so, that, they, were, defeated, at, the, onset, the, audience, recognized, this, the, truth, is, that, they, recognized, themselves, people, who, commit, suicide, do, not, care, to, do, it, in, front, of, witnesses, in, france, film, attendance, was, typically, low, in, july, the, rules, of, the, game, ended, its, run, at, the, colis, e, theatre, after, three, weeks, because, of, poor, attendance, it, later, was, shown, at, the, aubert, palace, in, paris, renoir, said, of, the, attendance, i, was, utterly, dumbfounded, when, it, became, apparent, that, the, film, which, i, wanted, to, be, a, pleasant, one, rubbed, most, people, the, wrong, way, renoir, initially, wanted, to, screen, the, film, at, the, 1939, world, s, fair, in, new, york, city, but, this, idea, was, abandoned, after, the, disastrous, release, in, france, claude, gauteur, surveyed, reviews, of, the, rules, of, the, game, published, in, paris, and, said, 12, were, unqualifiedly, unfavorable, 13, were, favorable, with, reservations, and, 10, were, favorable, many, reviews, criticized, the, film, for, being, unpatriotic, frivolous, and, incomprehensible, one, mixed, review, came, from, nino, frank, of, pour, vous, who, called, it, a, copious, work, even, too, much, so, very, complex, and, profoundly, intelligent, from, one, end, to, the, other, le, figaro, called, it, a, bizarre, spectacle, which, was, one, long, succession, of, errors, a, heavy, handed, fantasy, with, wooly, dialogue, in, the, 1943, edition, of, histoire, du, cin, ma, robert, brasillach, wrote, that, the, rules, of, the, game, was, among, renoir, s, most, jumbled, and, confused, films, but, applauded, the, biting, satire, which, he, considered, proustian, brasillach, also, praised, the, technical, variation, employed, by, the, director, and, said, the, film, was, an, unrealized, masterpiece, in, the, united, states, a, negative, review, from, variety, said, renoir, attempts, to, crowd, too, many, ideas, into, 80, minutes, of, film, fare, resulting, in, confusion, according, to, fran, ois, truffaut, the, film, was, very, disconcerting, to, audiences, at, the, time, because, of, its, peculiar, atmosphere, which, explains, its, commercial, failure, while, the, film, received, mostly, unfavorable, reviews, most, critics, praised, the, acting, including, renoir, s, and, only, the, far, right, wing, press, criticized, marcel, dalio, s, performance, in, july, 1939, a, right, wing, french, newspaper, criticized, the, film, for, portraying, the, jewish, marquis, married, to, the, austrian, christine, the, union, sacr, e, a, french, clerical, fascist, group, organized, demonstrations, wherever, the, film, was, screened, renoir, was, a, known, pacifist, and, supporter, of, the, communist, party, which, made, him, unpopular, in, the, tense, weeks, before, world, war, ii, began, years, later, renoir, said, there, was, no, question, of, contrivance, my, enemies, had, nothing, to, do, with, its, failure, at, every, session, i, attended, i, could, feel, the, unanimous, disapproval, of, the, audience, in, the, weeks, that, followed, the, premiere, renoir, reduced, the, film, s, running, time, from, its, original, 113, minutes, to, 100, minutes, then, to, 90, minutes, and, finally, to, 85, minutes, he, told, margurite, renoir, and, zwoboda, to, cut, the, scenes, that, the, audience, had, found, the, most, upsetting, renoir, said, he, mostly, cut, his, own, scenes, or, dialogue, as, though, i, were, ashamed, after, this, rebuff, of, showing, myself, on, the, screen, he, later, defended, his, own, performance, as, being, awkward, the, way, octave, should, have, been, the, reduction, in, length, removed, octave, s, complexity, and, completely, changed, the, character, s, motives, at, the, end, of, the, film, in, the, 85, minute, version, octave, does, not, intend, to, run, away, with, christine, and, merely, lends, andr, his, coat, for, warmth, before, sending, him, out, to, the, greenhouse, the, omission, of, this, item, in, the, plot, resulted, in, the, misconception, that, the, film, has, an, alternative, ending, this, was, first, reported, by, roger, manvell, after, he, watched, it, at, its, london, premiere, in, 1946, at, one, point, jean, jay, told, renoir, to, restore, the, film, to, the, 100, minute, version, to, avoid, commercial, disaster, but, none, of, the, shorter, versions, improved, its, reception, or, attendance, figures, when, asked, about, the, film, s, poor, reception, with, audience, members, renoir, said, i, thought, i, was, gentle, with, them, and, they, thought, i, was, laughing, at, them, in, october, 1939, the, rules, of, the, game, officially, was, banned, in, france, for, being, depressing, morbid, immoral, having, an, undesirable, influence, over, the, young, other, films, that, were, similarly, banned, included, marcel, carn, s, le, quai, des, brumes, and, le, jour, se, l, ve, the, ministry, of, foreign, affairs, stated, we, are, especially, anxious, to, avoid, representations, of, our, country, our, traditions, and, our, race, that, changes, its, character, lie, about, it, and, deform, it, through, the, prism, of, an, artistic, individual, who, is, often, original, but, not, always, sound, the, marriage, of, figaro, one, of, the, inspirations, for, the, film, had, been, banned, for, similar, reasons, after, the, end, of, world, war, ii, the, 85, minute, version, of, the, film, was, re, released, in, paris, on, september, 26, 1945, and, it, was, banned, again, renoir, said, that, of, all, his, films, the, rules, of, the, game, was, the, biggest, failure, at, the, time, of, its, release, he, also, said, its, failure, so, depressed, me, that, i, resolved, to, either, give, up, the, cinema, or, to, leave, france, during, shooting, renoir, was, offered, the, chance, to, film, an, adaptation, of, tosca, by, italian, producers, he, agreed, to, the, deal, on, july, 14, 1939, and, saw, it, as, an, opportunity, to, leave, france, renoir, and, carl, koch, traveled, to, rome, on, august, 10, for, pre, production, but, had, to, leave, on, august, 23, after, the, german, soviet, pact, made, his, french, citizenship, an, issue, koch, directed, the, film, instead, and, renoir, emigrated, to, hollywood, in, 1942, during, one, of, the, allied, bombings, of, boulogne, sur, seine,

new, york, city, in, april, 1950, but, it, was, critically, unsuccessful, a, review, in, the, new, york, times, called, it, one, for, the, buzzards, and, stated, the, master, has, dealt, his,

with, the, help, and, advice, of, renoir, and, jacques, durand, gaborit, and, mar, chal, restored, most, of, the, cut, footage, from, renoir, s, original, version, and, assembled, a, 106, minute, version, of, the, film, in, mid, 1959, renoir, saw, the, reconstructed, version, of, the, film, for, the, first, time, and, left, the, theater, in, tears, he, said, there, is, only, one, scene, missing, in, this, re, construction, a, scene, that, isn, t, very, important, it, s, a, scene, with, me, and, roland, toutain, that, deals, with, the, maids, sexual, interest, the, restored, version,

their, master, while, praising, the, reconstructed, version, of, the, film, in, 1961, howard, thompson, of, the, new, york, times, stated, the, film, completely, justified, its, european, reputation, a, memorable, experience, archer, winsten, of, the, new, york, post, praised, the, film, for, showing, the, corruption, of, french, society, from, top, to, bottom, and, a, new, york, herald, tribune,

the, 1966, bodil, award, for, best, non, american, film, best, european, film, bedste, europ, iske, film, in, denmark, we, are, all, mystified, that, is, to, say, fooled, duped, treated, as, of, no, account, i, had, the, good, fortune, to, have, been, taught, to, see, through, the, trickery, in, my, youth, in, la, r, gle, du, jeu, i, passed, on, what, i, knew, to, the, public, but, this, is, something, that, people, do, not, like, the, truth, makes, them, feel, uncomfortable, jean, renoir, from, his, autobiography, the, rules, of, the, game, is, remembered, as, a, commentary, on, the, moral, callousness, of, the, european, upper, class, and, their, servants, just, before, world, war, ii, while, making, the, film, renoir, knew, a, new, world, war, was, coming, he, later, said, there, was, a, sense, of, it, in, film, and, wrote, it, is, a, war, film, and, yet, there, is, no, reference, to, the, war, this, sense, of, doom, began, just, before, shooting, started, in, january, when, barcelona, fell, to, franco, and, throughout, the, production, when, prime, minister, of, france, douard, daladier, recognized, francoist, spain, italy, annexed, albania, and, adolf, hitler, prepared, his, invasion, of, poland, renoir, articulated, this, unmentioned, theme, of, the, film, by, saying, what, is, interesting, about, this, film, perhaps, is, the, moment, when, it, was, made, it, was, shot, between, munich, and, the, war, and, i, shot, it, absolutely, impressed, absolutely, disturbed, by, the, state, of, mind, of, a, part, of, french, society, a, part, of, english, society, a, part, of, world, society, and, it, seemed, to, me, that, a, way, of, interpreting, this, state, of, mind, to, the, world, hopefully, was, not, to, talk, of, that, situation, but, tell, a, frivolous, story, i, looked, for, inspiration, to, beaumarchais, to, marivaux, to, the, classical, authors, of, comedy, renoir, wanted, to, depict, people, as, they, truly, were, at, that, point, in, history, he, said, the, rules, of, the, game, was, a, reconstructed, documentary, a, documentary, on, the, condition, of, a, society, at, a, given, moment, he, believed, this, depiction, was, the, reason, behind, the, film, s, disastrous, premiere, saying, the, audience, s, reaction, was, due, to, my, candour, the, marriage, of, figaro, an, inspiration, for, the, film, had, also, been, considered, controversial, for, its, attack, on, the, class, system, the, rules, of, the, game, remained, controversial, with, the, french, public, shortly, after, world, war, ii, when, it, was, once, again, banned, renoir, s, biographer, ronald, bergan, said, the, film, hit, a, raw, nerve, with, the, public, by, depicting, people, who, might, have, had, an, influence, in, shaping, the, world, did, nothing, to, prevent, an, advance, of, fascism, some, of, whom, indeed, actually, welcomed, it, the, rabbit, hunt, scene, is, often, compared, to, the, senseless, death, that, occurs, during, war, renoir, said, he, wanted, to, show, a, certain, class, of, people, killing, for, no, reason, renoir, himself, had, never, killed, an, animal, and, called, hunting, an, abominable, exercise, in, cruelty, bergan, saw, the, analogy, to, world, events, and, wrote, in, the, great, set, piece, of, the, hunt, the, callous, cruelty, of, the, guests, is, laid, bare, as, they, fire, at, any, rabbit, and, bird, that, moves, after, the, beaters, have, led, the, game, to, slaughter, the, film, s, most, quoted, line, of, dialogue, spoken, by, octave, is, you, see, in, this, world, there, is, one, awful, thing, and, that, is, that, everyone, has, his, reasons, renoir, s, sentiment, of, objective, humanism, for, the, film, s, characters, is, articulated, by, octave, s, remark, and, shows, his, empathy, for, the, people, he, was, simultaneously, criticizing, richard, roud, praised, renoir, s, role, in, the, film, observing, that, renoir, s, honesty, compelled, him, to, include, his, own, role, in, his, social, criticism, he, did, not, wish, to, stand, outside, and, renoir, octave, serves, as, the, standard, against, which, reality, and, fiction, can, be, measured, in, his, original, outline, for, the, film, renoir, said, he, intended, all, the, characters, to, be, sincere, and, that, the, film, would, have, no, villains, renoir, said, andr, was, the, victim, who, trying, to, fit, into, a, world, in, which, he, does, not, belong, fails, to, respect, the, rules, of, the, game, and, that, andr, thought, he, could, shatter, the, rules, by, a, world, flight, while, christine, thought, she, could, do, the, same, by, following, her, heart, the, rules, of, the, film, s, title, are, its, only, villain, renoir, said, the, world, is, made, up, of, cliques, each, of, these, cliques, has, its, customs, its, mores, indeed, its, own, language, to, put, it, simply, each, has, its, rules, and, these, rules, determine, the, game, renoir, said, all, human, activity, is, subject, to, social, protocols, that, are, less, apparent, than, but, just, as, strict, as, those, practiced, by, louis, xiv, renoir, s, son, alain, said, the, film, continues, to, be, relevant, and, popular, because, it, shows, the, artificial, joy, of, the, modern, age, in, contrast, to, the, rules, of, that, or, any, age, filming, mile, zola, s, la, b, te, humaine, inspired, renoir, to, make, a, break, and, perhaps, get, away, from, naturalism, completely, to, try, to, touch, on, a, more, classical, more, poetic, genre, while, shooting, renoir, began, listening, to, baroque, music, by, louis, couperin, jean, philippe, rameau, jean, baptiste, lully, and, andr, gr, try, he, later, said, little, by, little, my, idea, took, shape, and, the, subject, got, simpler, i, kept, living, on, baroque, rhythms, and, after, a, few, more, days, the, subject, became, more, and, more, precise, he, also, said, he, began, imagining, simone, simon, moving, to, the, spirit, of, the, music, this, preoccupation, with, baroque, music, during, filming, led, to, renoir, s, original, idea, of, adapting, les, caprices, de, marianne, into, a, film, the, rules, of, the, game, is, known, for, its, early, and, elaborate, use, of, deep, focus, cinematography, renoir, said, he, and, his, cinematographer, jean, bachelet, ordered, some, special, lenses, very, fast, lenses, but, ones, that, still, gave, us, considerable, depth, so, that, we, could, keep, our, backgrounds, in, focus, almost, all, the, time, this, depth, of, field, in, his, shots, allowed, renoir, to, shoot, in, large, rooms, and, long, corridors, in, the, chateau, sequences, and, characters, were, able, to, move, freely, between, the, background, and, the, foreground, approximately, half, of, the, shots, in, the, film, have, camera, movements, in, many, shots, the, camera, moves, stops, in, place, changes, direction, and, circles, around, the, subjects, film, critic, david, thomson, said, one, has, the, impression, of, a, camera, that, is, always, moving, to, cover, as, much, as, possible, one, does, not, notice, cuts, one, delights, in, a, continuity, which, is, often, on, the, verge, of, chaos, and, finally, leads, to, tragedy, in, the, intrusion, of, subplot, into, plot, of, the, theatrical, into, the, real, and, of, disaster, into, balances, renoir, used, few, close, ups, or, reverse, shots, and, most, of, the, shots, are, two, shots, the, hunt, scene, differs, from, the, rest, of, the, film, it, uses, rapid, editing, whereas, most, of, the, film, uses, long, takes, of, dialogue, or, action, renoir, wanted, to, shoot, the, film, in, color, to, take, advantage, of, the, beauty, of, sologne, in, the, winter, but, he, was, unable, to, secure, funding, from, jean, jay, one, week, before, filming, began, renoir, tried, to, persuade, technicolor, to, fund, the, color, cinematography, but, the, company, refused, the, sound, in, the, film, was, complex, for, its, time, it, included, dialogue, spoken, over, ambient, noises, such, as, crowds, at, the, airport, and, gunfire, during, the, hunt, film, director, jean, prat, said, the, film, s, soundtrack, was, of, a, perfection, never, equaled, by, any, french, film, characters, often, talk, at, once, or, talk, over, each, other, s, lines, one, example, of, the, dense, soundtrack, is, the, party, scene, which, includes, dialogue, over, screams, gunfire, and, music, except, for, the, opening, credits, and, the, very, end, of, the, film, all, of, the, music, heard, in, the, film, is, incidental, the, sound, engineer, was, joseph, de, bretagne, music, used, in, the, film, includes, mozart, s, three, german, dances, monsigny, s, le, d, serteur, louis, byrec, l, on, garnier, and, eug, ne, rimbault, s, en, revenant, de, la, revue, strauss, s, die, fledermaus, saint, sa, ns, s, danse, macabre, chopin, s, minute, waltz, and, scotto, s, barbizon, the, music, was, arranged, by, joseph, kosma, and, roger, d, sormi, re, the, film, s, set, designers, eug, ne, louri, and, max, douy, built, one, of, the, most, expensive, sets, in, french, film, history, at, the, joinville, studio, according, to, douy, they, were, based, on, the, script, and, were, not, reproductions, of, the, interior, of, chateau, de, la, fert, saint, aubin, where, exterior, scenes, were, shot, the, music, boxes, used, in, the, film, were, borrowed, from, several, sources, and, some, are, now, in, a, museum, in, neuilly, sur, seine, renoir, thought, the, musical, organ, scene, and, dalio, s, performance, in, it, was, the, best, scene, he, had, ever, filmed, he, shot, the, scene, several, times, before, he, was, satisfied, with, it, the, costumes, for, the, film, were, designed, by, coco, chanel, since, its, restoration, the, rules, of, the, game, has, come, to, be, regarded, by, many, film, critics, and, directors, as, one, of, the, greatest, films, of, all, time, on, rotten, tomatoes, the, film, has, a, rating, of, 97, based, on, 59, reviews, with, an, average, rating, of, 9, 50, 10, the, website, s, consensus, reads, its, genius, escaped, many, viewers, at, the, time, but, in, retrospect, the, rules, of, the, game, stands, as, one, of, jean, renoir, s, and, cinema, s, finest, works, the, decennial, poll, of, international, critics, by, sight, sound, magazine, ranked, it, 10, in, 1952, elevated, it, to, no, 3, in, 1962, and, 2, in,

has, been, hailed, as, a, masterpiece, by, kent, jones, adolf, heinzlmeier, berndt, schulz, and, penelope, gilliatt, who, said, it, was, not, only, a, masterpiece, of, filmmaking, not, only, a, great, work, of, humanism, in, a, perfect, rococo, frame, but, also, an, act, of, historical, testimony, its, themes, have, been, analyzed, by, film, scholar, and, renoir, s, biographer, leo, braudy, who, observed, that, the, film, embodies, a, social, world, in, which, there, are, rules, but, no, values, if, you, don, t, know, the, rules, you, are, crushed, but, if, you, do, know, the, rules, you, are, cut, off, from, your, own, nature, dudley, andrew, described, the, film, s, complex, social, criticism, while, kenneth, browser, and, peter, cowie, wrote, about, its, sense, of, humanity, other, critics, have, written, about, the, film, s, darker, themes, andrew, sarris, praised, its, depiction, of, class, differences, the, complexity, of, renoir, s, storytelling, techniques, have, been, examined, by, roger, ebert, who, called, it, so, simple, and, so, labyrinthine, so, guileless, and, so, angry, so, innocent, and, so, dangerous, that, you, can, t, simply, watch, it, you, have, to, absorb, it, lucy, sante, who, labeled, it, a, dense, clockwork, mechanism, and, robin, wood, who, said, the, film, operates, on, all, levels, critics, have, praised, its, farcical, elements, pauline, kael, characterized, it, as, a, great, satirical, comedy, a, dance, of, death, and, gerald, mast, wrote, depicts, the, failure, of, love, the, failure, of, society, and, the, failure, of, men, to, rise, above, the, ridiculous, their, only, success, is, that, they, try, and, they, care, david, thomson, praised, renoir, s, performance, and, remarked, on, renoir, s, admission, that, the, director, supposedly, the, authoritative, and, manipulating, figure, is, as, much, victim, as, originator, of, circumstances, amy, taubin, said, i, can, think, of, no, other, film, that, is, as, unfailingly, generous, to, its, audience, its, characters, its, actors, the, milieu, and, the, medium, j, hoberman, wrote, about, its, influence, on, woody, allen, robert, altman, and, mike, leigh, the, film, especially, was, appreciated, by, filmmakers, and, film, critics, associated, with, the, french, new, wave, movement, bazin, said, as, a, conventional, love, story, the, film, could, have, been, a, success, if, the, scenario, had, respected, the, rules, of, the, movie, game, but, renoir, wanted, to, make, his, own, style, of, drame, gai, and, the, mixture, of, genres, proved, disconcerting, to,
