originally, used, by, record, companies, to, describe, recordings, marketed, predominantly, to, african, americans, at, a, time, when, rocking, jazz, based, music, heavy, insistent, beat, was, becoming, more, popular, in, the, commercial, rhythm, and, blues, music, typical, of, the, 1950s, through, the, 1970s, the, bands, usually, consisted, of, a, piano, one, or, two, guitars, bass, drums, one, or, more, saxophones, and, sometimes, background, vocalists, r, b, lyrical, themes, often, encapsulate, the, african, american, history, and, experience, of, pain, and, the, quest, for, freedom, and, joy, as, well, as, triumphs, and, failures, in, terms, of, societal, racism, oppression, relationships, economics, and, aspirations, the, term, rhythm, and, blues, has, undergone, a, number, of, shifts, in, meaning, in, the, early, 1950s, it, was, frequently, applied, to, blues, records, starting, in, the, mid, 1950s, after, this, style, of, music, had, contributed, to, the, development, of, rock, and, roll, the, term, r, b, became, used, in, a, wider, context, it, referred, to, music, styles, that, developed, from, and, incorporated, electric, blues, as, well, as, gospel, and, soul, music, from, 1960s, to, 70s, some, british, groups, were, referred, to, and, promoted, as, being, r, b, bands, by, the, 1970s, the, term, rhythm, and, blues, had, changed, once, again, and, was, used, as, a, blanket, term, for, soul, and, funk, in, the, late, 1980s, a, newer, style, of, r, b, developed, becoming, known, as, contemporary, r, b, this, contemporary, form, combines, rhythm, and, blues, with, various, elements, of, pop, soul, funk, disco, hip, hop, and, electronic, music, although, jerry, wexler, of, billboard, magazine, is, credited, with, coining, the, term, rhythm, and, blues, as, a, musical, term, in, the, united, states, in, 1948, the, term, had, been, used, in, billboard, as, early, as, 1943, however, the, company, s, first, list, of, songs, popular, among, african, americans, was, named, harlem, hit, parade, created, in, 1942, it, listed, the, most, popular, records, in, harlem, and, is, the, predecessor, to, the, billboard, rnb, chart, rhythm, and, blues, replaced, the, common, term, race, music, a, term, coined, by, okeh, producer, ralph, peer, based, on, the, common, self, description, by, the, african, american, press, as, people, of, race, the, term, rhythm, and, blues, was, then, used, by, billboard, in, its, chart, listings, from, june, 1949, until, august, 1969, when, its, hot, rhythm, blues, singles, chart, was, renamed, as, best, selling, soul, singles, before, the, rhythm, and, blues, name, was, instated, various, record, companies, had, already, begun, replacing, the, term, race, music, with, the, term, sepia, series,

defined, rhythm, blues, as, a, catchall, term, referring, to, any, music, that, was, made, by, and, for, black, americans, he, has, also, used, the, term, r, b, as, a, synonym, for, jump, blues, however, allmusic, separates, it, from, jump, blues, because, of, r, b, s, stronger, gospel, influences, lawrence, cohn, author, of, nothing, but, the, blues, writes, that, rhythm, and, blues, was, an, umbrella, term, invented, for, industry, convenience, according, to, him, the, term, embraced, all, black, music, except, classical, music, and, religious, music, unless, a, gospel, song, sold, enough, to, break, into, the, charts, well, into, the, 21st, century, the, term, r, b, continues, in, use, in, some, contexts, to, categorize, music, made, by, black, musicians, as, distinct, from, styles, of, music, made, by, other, musicians, in, the, commercial, rhythm, and, blues, music, typical, of, the, 1950s, through, the, 1970s, the, bands, usually, consisted, of, piano, one, or, two, guitars, bass, drums, and, saxophone, arrangements, were, rehearsed, to, the, point, of, effortlessness, and, were, sometimes, accompanied, by, background, vocalists, simple, repetitive, parts, mesh, creating, momentum, and, rhythmic, interplay, producing, mellow, lilting, and, often, hypnotic, textures, while, calling, attention, to, no, individual, sound, while, singers, are, emotionally, engaged, with, the, lyrics, often, intensely, so, they, remain, cool, relaxed, and, in, control, the, bands, dressed, in, suits, and, even, uniforms, a, practice, associated, with, the, modern, popular, music, that, rhythm, and, blues, performers, aspired, to, dominate, lyrics, often, seemed, fatalistic, and, the, music, typically, followed, predictable, patterns, of, chords, and, structure, r, b, lyrical, themes, often, encapsulate, the, african, american, experience, of, pain, and, the, quest, for, freedom, and, joy, as, well, as, triumphs, and, failures, in, terms, of, relationships, economics, and, aspirations, one, publication, of, the, smithsonian, institution, provided, this, summary, of, the, origins, of, the, genre, in, 2016, a, distinctly, african, american, music, drawing, from, the, deep, tributaries, of, african, american, expressive, culture, it, is, an, amalgam, of, jump, blues, big, band, swing, gospel, boogie, and, blues, that, was, initially, developed, during, a, thirty, year, period, that, bridges, the, era, of, legally, sanctioned, racial, segregation, international, conflicts, and, the, struggle, for, civil, rights, the, rock, roll, hall, of, fame, defines, some, of, the, originators, of, r, b, including, joe, turner, s, big, band, louis, jordan, s, tympany, five, james, brown, and, lavern, baker, in, fact, this, source, states, that, louis, jordan, joined, turner, in, laying, the, foundation, for, r, b, in, the, 1940s, cutting, one, swinging, rhythm, blues, masterpiece, after, another, other, artists, who, were, cornerstones, of, r, b, and, its, transformation, into, rock, roll, include, etta, james, fats, domino, roy, brown, little, richard, and, ruth, brown, the, doo, wop, groups, were, also, noteworthy, including, the, orioles, the, ravens, and, the, dominoes, the, term, rock, and, roll, had, a, strong, sexual, connotation, in, jump, blues, and, r, b, but, when, dj, alan, freed, referred, to, rock, and, roll, on, mainstream, radio, in, the, mid, 1950s, the, sexual, component, had, been, dialed, down, enough, that, it, simply, became, an, acceptable, term, for, dancing, the, great, migration, of, black, americans, to, the, urban, industrial, centers, of, chicago, detroit, new, york, city, los, angeles, washington, d, c, and, elsewhere, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, created, a, new, market, for, jazz, blues, and, related, genres, of, music, these, genres, of, music, were, often, performed, by, full, time, musicians, either, working, alone, or, in, small, groups, the, precursors, of, rhythm, and, blues, came, from, jazz, and, blues, which, overlapped, in, the, late, 1920s, and, 30s, through, the, work, of, musicians, such, as, the, harlem, hamfats, with, their, 1936, hit, oh, red, as, well, as, lonnie, johnson, leroy, carr, cab, calloway, count, basie, and, t, bone, walker, there, was, also, increasing, emphasis, on, the, electric, guitar, as, a, lead, instrument, as, well, as, the, piano, and, saxophone, r, b, originated, in, african, american, communities, in, the, 1940s, in, 1948, rca, victor, was, marketing, black, music, under, the, name, blues, and, rhythm, in, that, year, louis, jordan, dominated, the, top, five, listings, of, the, r, b, charts, with, three, songs, and, two, of, the, top, five, songs, were, based, on, the, boogie, woogie, rhythms, that, had, come, to, prominence, during, the, 1940s, jordan, s, band, the, tympany, five, formed, in, 1938, consisted, of, him, on, saxophone, and, vocals, along, with, musicians, on, trumpet, tenor, saxophone, piano, bass, and, drums, lawrence, cohn, described, the, music, as, grittier, than, his, boogie, era, jazz, tinged, blues, 173, robert, palmer, described, it, as, urbane, rocking, jazz, based, music, heavy, insistent, beat, jordan, s, music, along, with, that, of, big, joe, turner, roy, brown, billy, wright, and, wynonie, harris, is, now, also, referred, to, as, jump, blues, already, paul, gayten, roy, brown, and, others, had, had, hits, in, the, style, now, referred, to, as, rhythm, and, blues, in, 1948, wynonie, harris, s, remake, of, brown, s, 1947, recording, good, rockin, tonight, reached, number, two, on, the, charts, following, band, leader, sonny, thompson, s, long, gone, at, number, one, in, 1949, the, term, rhythm, and, blues, r, b, replaced, the, billboard, category, harlem, hit, parade, also, in, that, year, the, huckle, buck, recorded, by, band, leader, and, saxophonist, paul, williams, was, the, number, one, r, b, tune, remaining, on, top, of, the, charts, for, nearly, the, entire, year, written, by, musician, and, arranger, andy, gibson, the, song, was, described, as, a, dirty, boogie, because, it, was, risque, and, raunchy, paul, williams, and, his, hucklebuckers, concerts, were, sweaty, riotous, affairs, that, got, shut, down, on, more, than, one, occasion, their, lyrics, by, roy, alfred, who, later, co, wrote, the, 1955, hit, the, rock, and, roll, waltz, were, mildly, sexually, suggestive, and, one, teenager, from, philadelphia, said, that, hucklebuck, was, a, very, nasty, dance, also, in, 1949, a, new, version, of, a, 1920s, blues, song, ain, t, nobody, s, business, was, a, number, four, hit, for, jimmy, witherspoon, and, louis, jordan, and, the, tympany, five, once, again, made, the, top, five, with, saturday, night, fish, fry, many, of, these, hit, records, were, issued, on, new, independent, record, labels, such, as, savoy, founded, 1942, king, founded, 1943, imperial, founded, 1945, specialty, founded, 1946, chess, founded, 1947, and, atlantic, founded, 1948, african, american, music, began, incorporating, afro, cuban, rhythmic, motifs, in, the, 1800s, with, the, popularity, of, the, cuban, contradanza, known, outside, of, cuba, as, the, habanera, the, habanera, rhythm, can, be, thought, of, as, a, combination, of, tresillo, and, the, backbeat, for, the, more, than, a, quarter, century, in, which, the, cakewalk, ragtime, and, proto, jazz, were, forming, and, developing, the, cuban, genre, habanera, exerted, a, constant, presence, in, african, american, popular, music, jazz, pioneer, jelly, roll, morton, considered, the, tresillo, habanera, rhythm, which, he, called, the, spanish, tinge, to, be, an, essential, ingredient, of, jazz, there, are, examples, of, tresillo, like, rhythms, in, some, african, american, folk, music, such, as, the, hand, clapping, and, foot, stomping, patterns, in, ring, shout, post, civil, war, drum, and, fife, music, and, new, orleans, second, line, music, wynton, marsalis, considers, tresillo, to, be, the, new, orleans, clave, although, technically, the, pattern, is, only, half, a, clave, tresillo, is, the, most, basic, duple, pulse, rhythmic, cell, in, sub, saharan, african, music, traditions, and, its, use, in, african, american, music, is, one, of, the, clearest, examples, of, african, rhythmic, retention, in, the, united, states, the, use, of, tresillo, was, continuously, reinforced, by, the, consecutive, waves, of, cuban, music, which, were, adopted, into, north, american, popular, culture, in, 1940, bob, zurke, released, rhumboogie, a, boogie, woogie, with, a, tresillo, bass, line, and, lyrics, proudly, declaring, the, adoption, of, cuban, rhythm, harlem, s, got, a, new, rhythm, man, it, s, burning, up, the, dance, floors, because, it, s, so, hot, they, took, a, little, rhumba, rhythm, and, added, boogie, woogie, and, now, look, what, they, got, rhumboogie, it, s, harlem, s, new, creation, with, the, cuban, syncopation, it, s, the, killer, just, plant, your, both, feet, on, each, side, let, both, your, hips, and, shoulder, glide, then, throw, your, body, back, and, ride, there, s, nothing, like, rhumbaoogie, rhumboogie, boogie, woogie, in, harlem, or, havana, you, can, kiss, the, old, savannah, it, s, a, killer, although, originating, in, the, metropolis, at, the, mouth, of, the, mississippi, river, new, orleans, blues, with, its, afro, caribbean, rhythmic, traits, is, distinct, from, the, sound, of, the, mississippi, delta, blues, in, the, late, 1940s, new, orleans, musicians, were, especially, receptive, to, cuban, influences, precisely, at, the, time, when, r, b, was, first, forming, the, first, use, of, tresillo, in, r, b, occurred, in, new, orleans, robert, palmer, recalls, new, orleans, producer, bandleader, dave, bartholomew, first, employed, this, figure, as, a, saxophone, section, riff, on, his, own, 1949, disc, country, boy, and, subsequently, helped, make, it, the, most, over, used, rhythmic, pattern, in, 1950s, rock, n, roll, on, numerous, recordings, by, fats, domino, little, richard, and, others, bartholomew, assigned, this, repeating, three, note, pattern, not, just, to, the, string, bass, but, also, to, electric, guitars, and, even, baritone, sax, making, for, a, very, heavy, bottom, he, recalls, first, hearing, the, figure, as, a, bass, pattern, on, a, cuban, disc, in, a, 1988, interview, with, palmer, bartholomew, who, had, the, first, r, b, studio, band, revealed, how, he, initially, superimposed, tresillo, over, swing, rhythm, i, heard, the, bass, playing, that, part, on, a, rumba, record, on, country, boy, i, had, my, bass, and, drums, playing, a, straight, swing, rhythm, and, wrote, out, that, rumba, bass, part, for, the, saxes, to, play, on, top, of, the, swing, rhythm, later, especially, after, rock, n, roll, came, along, i, made, the, rumba, bass, part, heavier, and, heavier, i, d, have, the, string, bass, an, electric, guitar, and, a, baritone, all, in, unison, bartholomew, referred, to, the, cuban, son, by, the, misnomer, rumba, a, common, practice, of, that, time, fats, domino, s, blue, monday, produced, by, bartholomew, is, another, example, of, this, now, classic, use, of, tresillo, in, r, b, bartholomew, s, 1949, tresillo, based, oh, cubanas, is, an, attempt, to, blend, african, american, and, afro, cuban, music, the, word, mambo, larger, than, any, of, the, other, text, is, placed, prominently, on, the, record, label, in, his, composition, misery, new, orleans, pianist, professor, longhair, plays, a, habanera, like, figure, in, his, left, hand, the, deft, use, of, triplets, is, a, characteristic, of, longhair, s, style, gerhard, kubik, notes, that, with, the, exception, of, new, orleans, early, blues, lacked, complex, polyrhythms, and, there, was, a, very, specific, absence, of, asymmetric, time, line, patterns, key, patterns, in, virtually, all, early, twentieth, century, african, american, music, only, in, some, new, orleans, genres, does, a, hint, of, simple, time, line, patterns, occasionally, appear, in, the, form, of, transient, so, called, stomp, patterns, or, stop, time, chorus, these, do, not, function, in, the, same, way, as, african, timelines, in, the, late, 1940s, this, changed, somewhat, when, the, two, celled, timeline, structure, was, brought, into, the, blues, new, orleans, musicians, such, as, bartholomew, and, longhair, incorporated, cuban, instruments, as, well, as, the, clave, pattern, and, related, two, celled, figures, in, songs, such, as, carnival, day, bartholomew, 1949, and, mardi, gras, in, new, orleans, longhair, 1949, while, some, of, these, early, experiments, were, awkward, fusions, the, afro, cuban, elements, were, eventually, integrated, fully, into, the, new, orleans, sound, robert, palmer, reports, that, in, the, 1940s, professor, longhair, listened, to, and, played, with, musicians, from, the, islands, and, fell, under, the, spell, of, perez, prado, s, mambo, records, he, was, especially, enamored, with, afro, cuban, music, michael, campbell, states, professor, longhair, s, influence, was, far, reaching, in, several, of, his, early, recordings, professor, longhair, blended, afro, cuban, rhythms, with, rhythm, and, blues, the, most, explicit, is, longhair, s, blues, rhumba, where, he, overlays, a, straightforward, blues, with, a, clave, rhythm, longhair, s, particular, style, was, known, locally, as, rumba, boogie, in, his, mardi, gras, in, new, orleans, the, pianist, employs, the, 2, 3, clave, onbeat, offbeat, motif, in, a, rumba, boogie, guajeo, the, syncopated, but, straight, subdivision, feel, of, cuban, music, as, opposed, to, swung, subdivisions, took, root, in, new, orleans, r, b, during, this, time, alexander, stewart, states, that, the, popular, feel, was, passed, along, from, new, orleans, through, james, brown, s, music, to, the, popular, music, of, the, 1970s, adding, the, singular, style, of, rhythm, blues, that, emerged, from, new, orleans, in, the, years, after, world, war, ii, played, an, important, role, in, the, development, of, funk, in, a, related, development, the, underlying, rhythms, of, american, popular, music, underwent, a, basic, yet, generally, unacknowledged, transition, from, a, triplet, or, shuffle, feel, to, even, or, straight, eighth, notes, concerning, the, various, funk, motifs, stewart, states, that, this, model, is, different, from, a, time, line, such, as, clave, and, tresillo, in, that, it, is, not, an, exact, pattern, but, more, of, a, loose, organizing, principle, johnny, otis, released, the, r, b, mambo, mambo, boogie, in, january, 1951, featuring, congas, maracas, claves, and, mambo, saxophone, guajeos, in, a, blues, progression, ike, turner, recorded, cubano, jump, 1954, an, electric, guitar, instrumental, which, is, built, around, several, 2, 3, clave, figures, adopted, from, the, mambo, the, hawketts, in, mardi, gras, mambo, 1955, featuring, the, vocals, of, a, young, art, neville, make, a, clear, reference, to, perez, prado, in, their, use, of, his, trademark, unhh, in, the, break, after, the, introduction, ned, sublette, states, the, electric, blues, cats, were, very, well, aware, of, latin, music, and, there, was, definitely, such, a, thing, as, rhumba, blues, you, can, hear, muddy, waters, and, howlin, wolf, playing, it, he, also, cites, otis, rush, ike, turner, and, ray, charles, as, r, b, artists, who, employed, this, feel, the, use, of, clave, in, r, b, coincided, with, the, growing, dominance, of, the, backbeat, and, the, rising, popularity, of, cuban, music, in, the, u, s, in, a, sense, clave, can, be, distilled, down, to, tresillo, three, side, answered, by, the, backbeat, two, side, the, bo, diddley, beat, 1955, is, perhaps, the, first, true, fusion, of, 3, 2, clave, and, r, b, rock, n, roll, bo, diddley, has, given, different, accounts, of, the, riff, s, origins, sublette, asserts, in, the, context, of, the, time, and, especially, those, maracas, bo, diddley, has, to, be, understood, as, a, latin, tinged, record, a, rejected, cut, recorded, at, the, same, session, was, titled, only, rhumba, on, the, track, sheets, johnny, otis, s, willie, and, the, hand, jive, 1958, is, another, example, of, this, successful, blend, of, 3, 2, claves, and, r, b, otis, used, the, cuban, instruments, claves, and, maracas, on, the, song, afro, cuban, music, was, the, conduit, by, which, african, american, music, was, re, africanized, through, the, adoption, of, two, celled, figures, like, clave, and, afro, cuban, instruments, like, the, conga, drum, bongos, maracas, and, claves, according, to, john, storm, roberts, r, b, became, the, vehicle, for, the, return, of, cuban, elements, into, mass, popular, music, ahmet, ertegun, producer, for, atlantic, records, is, reported, to, have, said, that, afro, cuban, rhythms, added, color, and, excitement, to, the, basic, drive, of, r, b, as, ned, sublette, points, out, though, by, the, 1960s, with, cuba, the, object, of, a, united, states, embargo, that, still, remains, in, effect, today, the, island, nation, had, been, forgotten, as, a, source, of, music, by, the, time, people, began, to, talk, about, rock, and, roll, as, having, a, history, cuban, music, had, vanished, from, north, american, consciousness, at, first, only, african, americans, were, buying, r, b, discs, according, to, jerry, wexler, of, atlantic, records, sales, were, localized, in, african, american, markets, there, were, no, white, sales, or, white, radio, play, during, the, early, 1950s, more, white, teenagers, started, to, become, aware, of, r, b, and, began, purchasing, the, music, for, example, 40, of, 1952, sales, at, dolphin, s, of, hollywood, record, shop, located, in, an, african, american, area, of, los, angeles, were, to, whites, eventually, white, teens, across, the, country, turned, their, musical, taste, toward, rhythm, and, blues, johnny, otis, who, had, signed, with, the, newark, new, jersey, based, savoy, records, produced, many, r, b, hits, in, 1951, including, double, crossing, blues, mistrustin, blues, and, cupid, s, boogie, all, of, which, hit, number, one, that, year, otis, scored, ten, top, ten, hits, that, year, other, hits, include, gee, baby, mambo, boogie, and, all, nite, long, the, clovers, a, quintet, consisting, of, a, vocal, quartet, with, accompanying, guitarist, sang, a,

recording, for, rca, records, in, the, jump, blues, style, of, late, 1940s, stars, roy, brown, and, billy, wright, however, it, was, not, until, he, recorded, a, demo, in, 1954, that, caught, the, attention, of, specialty, records, that, the, world, would, start, to, hear, his, new, uptempo, funky, rhythm, and, blues, that, would, catapult, him, to, fame, in, 1955, and, help, define, the, sound, of, rock, n, roll, a, rapid, succession, of, rhythm, and, blues, hits, followed, beginning, with, tutti, frutti, and, long, tall, sally, which, would, influence, performers, such, as, james, brown, elvis, presley, and, otis, redding, also, in, 1951, the, song, rocket, 88, was, recorded, by, ike, turner, and, his, kings, of, rhythm, at, a, studio, owned, by, sam, phillips, with, the, vocal, by, jackie, brenston, this, song, is, often, cited, as, a, precursor, to, rock, and, roll, or, as, one, of, the, first, records, in, that, genre, in, a, later, interview, however, ike, turner, offered, this, comment, i, don, t, think, that, rocket, 88, is, rock, n, roll, i, think, that, rocket, 88, is, r, b, but, i, think, rocket, 88, is, the, cause, of, rock, and, roll, existing, ruth,
