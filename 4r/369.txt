https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony
a, symphony, is, an, extended, musical, composition, in, western, classical, music, most, often, for, orchestra, although, the, term, has, had, many, meanings, from, its, origins, in, the, ancient, greek, era, by, the, late, 18th, century, the, word, had, taken, on, the, meaning, common, today, a, work, usually, consisting, of, multiple, distinct, sections, or, movements, often, four, with, the, first, movement, in, sonata, form, symphonies, are, almost, always, scored, for, an, orchestra, consisting, of, a, string, section, violin, viola, cello, and, double, bass, brass, woodwind, and, percussion, instruments, which, altogether, number, about, 30, to, 100, musicians, symphonies, are, notated, in, a, musical, score, which, contains, all, the, instrument, parts, orchestral, musicians, play, from, parts, which, contain, just, the, notated, music, for, their, own, instrument, some, symphonies, also, contain, vocal, parts, e, g, beethoven, s, ninth, symphony, or, mahler, s, second, symphony, the, word, symphony, is, derived, from, the, greek, word, symph, n, a, meaning, agreement, or, concord, of, sound, concert, of, vocal, or, instrumental, music, from, s, mph, nos, harmonious, the, word, referred, to, a, variety, of, different, concepts, before, ultimately, settling, on, its, current, meaning, designating, a, musical, form, in, late, greek, and, medieval, theory, the, word, was, used, for, consonance, as, opposed, to, diaph, n, a, which, was, the, word, for, dissonance, in, the, middle, ages, and, later, the, latin, form, symphonia, was, used, to, describe, various, instruments, especially, those, capable, of, producing, more, than, one, sound, simultaneously, isidore, of, seville, was, the, first, to, use, the, word, symphonia, as, the, name, of, a, two, headed, drum, and, from, c, 1155, to, 1377, the, french, form, symphonie, was, the, name, of, the, organistrum, or, hurdy, gurdy, in, late, medieval, england, symphony, was, used, in, both, of, these, senses, whereas, by, the, 16th, century, it, was, equated, with, the, dulcimer, in, german, symphonie, was, a, generic, term, for, spinets, and, virginals, from, the, late, 16th, century, to, the, 18th, century, in, the, sense, of, sounding, together, the, word, begins, to, appear, in, the, titles, of, some, works, by, 16th, and, 17th, century, composers, including, giovanni, gabrieli, s, sacrae, symphoniae, and, symphoniae, sacrae, liber, secundus, published, in, 1597, and, 1615, respectively, adriano, banchieri, s, eclesiastiche, sinfonie, dette, canzoni, in, aria, francese, per, sonare, et, cantare, op, 16, published, in, 1607, lodovico, grossi, da, viadana, s, sinfonie, musicali, op, 18, published, in, 1610, and, heinrich, sch, tz, s, symphoniae, sacrae, op, 6, and, symphoniarum, sacrarum, secunda, pars, op, 10, published, in, 1629, and, 1647, respectively, except, for, viadana, s, collection, which, contained, purely, instrumental, and, secular, music, these, were, all, collections, of, sacred, vocal, works, some, with, instrumental, accompaniment, in, the, 17th, century, for, most, of, the, baroque, era, the, terms, symphony, and, sinfonia, were, used, for, a, range, of, different, compositions, including, instrumental, pieces, used, in, operas, sonatas, and, concertos, usually, part, of, a, larger, work, the, opera, sinfonia, or, italian, overture, had, by, the, 18th, century, a, standard, structure, of, three, contrasting, movements, fast, slow, fast, and, dance, like, it, is, this, form, that, is, often, considered, as, the, direct, forerunner, of, the, orchestral, symphony, the, terms, overture, symphony, and, sinfonia, were, widely, regarded, as, interchangeable, for, much, of, the, 18th, century, in, the, 17th, century, pieces, scored, for, large, instrumental, ensemble, did, not, precisely, designate, which, instruments, were, to, play, which, parts, as, is, the, practice, from, the, 19th, century, to, the, current, period, when, composers, from, the, 17th, century, wrote, pieces, they, expected, that, these, works, would, be, performed, by, whatever, group, of, musicians, were, available, to, give, one, example, whereas, the, bassline, in, a, 19th, century, work, is, scored, for, cellos, double, basses, and, other, specific, instruments, in, a, 17th, century, work, a, basso, continuo, part, for, a, sinfonia, would, not, specify, which, instruments, would, play, the, part, a, performance, of, the, piece, might, be, done, with, a, basso, continuo, group, as, small, as, a, single, cello, and, harpsichord, however, if, a, bigger, budget, was, available, for, a, performance, and, a, larger, sound, was, required, a, basso, continuo, group, might, include, multiple, chord, playing, instruments, harpsichord, lute, etc, and, a, range, of, bass, instruments, including, cello, double, bass, bass, viol, or, even, a, serpent, an, early, bass, wind, instrument, larue, bonds, walsh, and, wilson, write, in, the, second, edition, of, the, new, grove, dictionary, of, music, and, musicians, that, the, symphony, was, cultivated, with, extraordinary, intensity, in, the, 18th, century, it, played, a, role, in, many, areas, of, public, life, including, church, services, but, a, particularly, strong, area, of, support, for, symphonic, performances, was, the, aristocracy, in, vienna, perhaps, the, most, important, location, in, europe, for, the, composition, of, symphonies, literally, hundreds, of, noble, families, supported, musical, establishments, generally, dividing, their, time, between, vienna, and, their, ancestral, estate, since, the, normal, size, of, the, orchestra, at, the, time, was, quite, small, many, of, these, courtly, establishments, were, capable, of, performing, symphonies, the, young, joseph, haydn, taking, up, his, first, job, as, a, music, director, in, 1757, for, the, morzin, family, found, that, when, the, morzin, household, was, in, vienna, his, own, orchestra, was, only, part, of, a, lively, and, competitive, musical, scene, with, multiple, aristocrats, sponsoring, concerts, with, their, own, ensembles, larue, bonds, walsh, and, wilson, s, article, traces, the, gradual, expansion, of, the, symphonic, orchestra, through, the, 18th, century, at, first, symphonies, were, string, symphonies, written, in, just, four, parts, first, violin, second, violin, viola, and, bass, the, bass, line, was, taken, by, cello, s, double, bass, es, playing, the, part, an, octave, below, and, perhaps, also, a, bassoon, occasionally, the, early, symphonists, even, dispensed, with, the, viola, part, thus, creating, three, part, symphonies, a, basso, continuo, part, including, a, bassoon, together, with, a, harpsichord, or, other, chording, instrument, was, also, possible, the, first, additions, to, this, simple, ensemble, were, a, pair, of, horns, occasionally, a, pair, of, oboes, and, then, both, horns, and, oboes, together, over, the, century, other, instruments, were, added, to, the, classical, orchestra, flutes, sometimes, replacing, the, oboes, separate, parts, for, bassoons, clarinets, and, trumpets, and, timpani, works, varied, in, their, scoring, concerning, which, of, these, additional, instruments, were, to, appear, the, full, scale, classical, orchestra, deployed, at, the, end, of, the, century, for, the, largest, scale, symphonies, has, the, standard, string, ensemble, mentioned, above, pairs, of, winds, flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, a, pair, of, horns, and, timpani, a, keyboard, continuo, instrument, harpsichord, or, piano, remained, an, option, the, italian, style, of, symphony, often, used, as, overture, and, entr, acte, in, opera, houses, became, a, standard, three, movement, form, a, fast, movement, a, slow, movement, and, another, fast, movement, over, the, course, of, the, 18th, century, it, became, the, custom, to, write, four, movement, symphonies, along, the, lines, described, in, the, next, paragraph, the, three, movement, symphony, died, out, slowly, about, half, of, haydn, s, first, thirty, symphonies, are, in, three, movements, and, for, the, young, mozart, the, three, movement, symphony, was, the, norm, perhaps, under, the, influence, of, his, friend, johann, christian, bach, an, outstanding, late, example, of, the, three, movement, classical, symphony, is, mozart, s, prague, symphony, from, 1786, the, four, movement, form, that, emerged, from, this, evolution, was, as, follows, variations, on, this, layout, like, changing, the, order, of, the, middle, movements, or, adding, a, slow, introduction, to, the, first, movement, were, common, haydn, mozart, and, their, contemporaries, restricted, their, use, of, the, four, movement, form, to, orchestral, or, multi, instrument, chamber, music, such, as, quartets, though, since, beethoven, solo, sonatas, are, as, often, written, in, four, as, in, three, movements, the, composition, of, early, symphonies, was, centred, on, milan, vienna, and, mannheim, the, milanese, school, centred, around, giovanni, battista, sammartini, and, included, antonio, brioschi, ferdinando, galimberti, and, giovanni, battista, lampugnani, early, exponents, of, the, form, in, vienna, included, georg, christoph, wagenseil, wenzel, raimund, birck, and, georg, matthias, monn, while, later, significant, viennese, composers, of, symphonies, included, johann, baptist, wanhal, carl, ditters, von, dittersdorf, and, leopold, hofmann, the, mannheim, school, included, johann, stamitz, the, most, important, symphonists, of, the, latter, part, of, the, 18th, century, are, haydn, who, wrote, at, least, 106, symphonies, over, the, course, of, 36, years, and, mozart, with, at, least, 47, symphonies, in, 24, years, at, the, beginning, of, the, 19th, century, beethoven, elevated, the, symphony, from, an, everyday, genre, produced, in, large, quantities, to, a, supreme, form, in, which, composers, strove, to, reach, the, highest, potential, of, music, in, just, a, few, works, beethoven, began, with, two, works, directly, emulating, his, models, mozart, and, haydn, then, seven, more, symphonies, starting, with, the, third, symphony, eroica, that, expanded, the, scope, and, ambition, of, the, genre, his, symphony, no, 5, is, perhaps, the, most, famous, symphony, ever, written, its, transition, from, the, emotionally, stormy, c, minor, opening, movement, to, a, triumphant, major, key, finale, provided, a, model, adopted, by, later, symphonists, such, as, brahms, and, mahler, his, symphony, no, 6, is, a, programmatic, work, featuring, instrumental, imitations, of, bird, calls, and, a, storm, and, unconventionally, a, fifth, movement, symphonies, usually, had, at, most, four, movements, his, symphony, no, 9, includes, parts, for, vocal, soloists, and, choir, in, the, last, movement, making, it, a, choral, symphony, of, the, symphonies, by, schubert, two, are, core, repertory, items, and, are, frequently, performed, of, the, eighth, symphony, 1822, schubert, completed, only, the, first, two, movements, this, highly, romantic, work, is, usually, called, by, its, nickname, the, unfinished, his, last, completed, symphony, the, ninth, 1826, is, a, massive, work, in, the, classical, idiom, of, the, early, romantics, felix, mendelssohn, five, symphonies, plus, thirteen, string, symphonies, and, robert, schumann, four, continued, to, write, symphonies, in, the, classical, mould, though, using, their, own, musical, language, in, contrast, berlioz, favored, programmatic, works, including, his, dramatic, symphony, rom, o, et, juliette, the, viola, symphony, harold, en, italie, and, the, highly, original, symphonie, fantastique, the, latter, is, also, a, programme, work, and, has, both, a, march, and, a, waltz, and, five, movements, instead, of, the, customary, four, his, fourth, and, last, symphony, the, grande, symphonie, fun, bre, et, triomphale, originally, titled, symphonie, militaire, was, composed, in, 1840, for, a, 200, piece, marching, military, band, to, be, performed, out, of, doors, and, is, an, early, example, of, a, band, symphony, berlioz, later, added, optional, string, parts, and, a, choral, finale, in, 1851, richard, wagner, declared, that, all, of, these, post, beethoven, symphonies, were, no, more, than, an, epilogue, offering, nothing, substantially, new, indeed, after, schumann, s, last, symphony, the, rhenish, composed, in, 1850, for, two, decades, the, lisztian, symphonic, poem, appeared, to, have, displaced, the, symphony, as, the, leading, form, of, large, scale, instrumental, music, however, liszt, also, composed, two, programmatic, choral, symphonies, during, this, time, faust, and, dante, if, the, symphony, had, otherwise, been, eclipsed, it, was, not, long, before, it, re, emerged, in, a, second, age, in, the, 1870s, and, 1880s, with, the, symphonies, by, bruckner, brahms, tchaikovsky, saint, sa, ns, borodin, dvo, k, and, franck, works, which, largely, avoided, the, programmatic, elements, of, berlioz, and, liszt, and, dominated, the, concert, repertory, for, at, least, a, century, over, the, course, of, the, 19th, century, composers, continued, to, add, to, the, size, of, the, symphonic, orchestra, around, the, beginning, of, the, century, a, full, scale, orchestra, would, consist, of, the, string, section, plus, pairs, of, flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, horns, trumpets, and, lastly, a, set, of, timpani, this, is, for, instance, the, scoring, used, in, beethoven, s, symphonies, numbered, 1, 2, 4, 7, and, 8, trombones, which, had, previously, been, confined, to, church, and, theater, music, came, to, be, added, to, the, symphonic, orchestra, notably, in, beethoven, s, 5th, 6th, and, 9th, symphonies, the, combination, of, bass, drum, triangle, and, cymbals, sometimes, also, piccolo, which, 18th, century, composers, employed, as, a, coloristic, effect, in, so, called, turkish, music, came, to, be, increasingly, used, during, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, without, any, such, connotations, of, genre, by, the, time, of, mahler, see, below, it, was, possible, for, a, composer, to, write, a, symphony, scored, for, a, veritable, compendium, of, orchestral, instruments, in, addition, to, increasing, in, variety, of, instruments, 19th, century, symphonies, were, gradually, augmented, with, more, string, players, and, more, wind, parts, so, that, the, orchestra, grew, substantially, in, sheer, numbers, as, concert, halls, likewise, grew, towards, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, gustav, mahler, began, writing, long, large, scale, symphonies, that, he, continued, composing, into, the, early, 20th, century, his, third, symphony, completed, in, 1896, is, one, of, the, longest, regularly, performed, symphonies, at, around, 100, minutes, in, length, for, most, performances, the, eighth, symphony, was, composed, in, 1906, and, is, nicknamed, the, symphony, of, a, thousand, because, of, the, large, number, of, voices, required, to, perform, the, work, the, 20th, century, saw, further, diversification, in, the, style, and, content, of, works, that, composers, labeled, symphonies, some, composers, including, dmitri, shostakovich, sergei, rachmaninoff, and, carl, nielsen, continued, to, write, in, the, traditional, four, movement, form, while, other, composers, took, different, approaches, jean, sibelius, symphony, no, 7, his, last, is, in, one, movement, richard, strauss, alpine, symphony, in, one, movement, split, into, twenty, two, parts, detailing, an, eleven, hour, hike, through, the, mountains, and, alan, hovhaness, s, symphony, no, 9, saint, vartan, originally, op, 80, changed, to, op, 180, composed, in, 1949, 50, is, in, twenty, four, a, concern, with, unification, of, the, traditional, four, movement, symphony, into, a, single, subsuming, formal, conception, had, emerged, in, the, late, 19th, century, this, has, been, called, a, two, dimensional, symphonic, form, and, finds, its, key, turning, point, in, arnold, schoenberg, s, chamber, symphony, no, 1, op, 9, 1909, which, was, followed, in, the, 1920s, by, other, notable, single, movement, german, symphonies, including, kurt, weill, s, first, symphony, 1921, max, butting, s, chamber, symphony, op, 25, 1923, and, paul, dessau, s, 1926, symphony, alongside, this, experimentation, other, 20th, century, symphonies, deliberately, attempted, to, evoke, the, 18th, century, origins, of, the, genre, in, terms, of, form, and, even, musical, style, with, prominent, examples, being, sergei, prokofiev, s, symphony, no, 1, classical, of, 1916, 17, and, the, symphony, in, c, by, igor, stravinsky, of, 1938, 40, there, remained, however, certain, tendencies, designating, a, work, a, symphony, still, implied, a, degree, of, sophistication, and, seriousness, of, purpose, the, word, sinfonietta, came, into, use, to, designate, a, work, that, is, shorter, of, more, modest, aims, or, lighter, than, a, symphony, such, as, sergei, prokofiev, s, sinfonietta, for, orchestra, in, the, first, half, of, the, century, composers, including, edward, elgar, gustav, mahler, jean, sibelius, carl, nielsen, igor, stravinsky, bohuslav, martin, roger, sessions, sergei, prokofiev, rued, langgaard, and, dmitri, shostakovich, composed, symphonies, extraordinary, in, scope, richness, originality, and, urgency, of, expression, one, measure, of, the, significance, of, a, symphony, is, the, degree, to, which, it, reflects, conceptions, of, temporal, form, particular, to, the, age, in, which, it, was, created, five, composers, from, across, the, span, of, the, 20th, century, who, fulfil, this, measure, are, jean, sibelius, igor, stravinsky, luciano, berio, in, his, sinfonia, 1968, 69, elliott, carter, in, his, symphony, of, three, orchestras, 1976, and, pelle, gudmundsen, holmgreen, in, symphony, antiphony, 1980, from, the, mid, 20th, century, into, the, 21st, there, has, been, a, resurgence, of, interest, in, the, symphony, with, many, postmodernist, composers, adding, substantially, to, the, canon, not, least, in, the, united, kingdom, peter, maxwell, davies, 10, robin, holloway, 1, david, matthews, 9, james, macmillan, 5, peter, seabourne, 6, and, philip, sawyers, 6, british, composer, derek, bourgeois, has, surpassed, the, number, of, symphonies, written, by, haydn, with, 116, symphonies, the, greatest, number, of, symphonies, to, date, has, been, composed, by, the, finn, leif, segerstam, whose, list, of, works, includes, 371, symphonies, hector, berlioz, originally, wrote, the, grande, symphonie, fun, bre, et, triomphale, for, military, band, in, 1840, anton, reicha, had, composed, his, four, movement, commemoration, symphony, also, known, as, musique, pour, c, l, brer, le, m, morie, des, grands, hommes, qui, se, sont, illustr, s, au, service, de, la, nation, fran, aise, for, large, wind, ensemble, even, earlier, in, 1815, for, ceremonies, associated, with, the, reburial, of, louis, xvi, and, marie, antoinette, after, those, early, efforts, few, symphonies, were, written, for, wind, bands, until, the, 20th, century, when, more, symphonies, were, written, for, concert, band, than, in, past, centuries, although, examples, exist, from, as, early, as, 1932, the, first, such, symphony, of, importance, is, nikolai, myaskovsky, s, symphony, no, 19, op, 46, composed, in, 1939, some, further, examples, are, paul, hindemith, s, symphony, in, b, flat, for, band, composed, in,

symphony, as, a, possible, abbreviated, form, of, vancouver, symphony, orchestra, additionally, in, common, usage, a, person, may, say, they, are, going, out, to, hear, a, symphony, perform, a, reference, to, the, orchestra, and, not, the, works, on, the, program, these, usages, are, not, common, in, british, english
