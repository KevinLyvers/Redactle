the, cinema, of, the, soviet, union, includes, films, produced, by, the, constituent, republics, of, the, soviet, union, reflecting, elements, of, their, pre, soviet, culture, language, and, history, albeit, they, were, all, regulated, by, the, central, government, in, moscow, most, prolific, in, their, republican, films, after, the, russian, soviet, federative, socialist, republic, were, armenia, azerbaijan, georgia, ukraine, and, to, a, lesser, degree, lithuania, belarus, and, moldavia, at, the, same, time, the, nation, s, film, industry, which, was, fully, nationalized, throughout, most, of, the, country, s, history, was, guided, by, philosophies, and, laws, propounded, by, the, monopoly, soviet, communist, party, which, introduced, a, new, view, on, the, cinema, socialist, realism, which, was, different, from, the, one, before, or, after, the, existence, of, the, soviet, union, upon, the, establishment, of, the, russian, soviet, federative, socialist, republic, rsfsr, on, november, 7, 1917, although, the, union, of, soviet, socialist, republics, did, not, officially, come, into, existence, until, december, 30, 1922, what, had, formerly, been, the, russian, empire, began, quickly, to, come, under, the, domination, of, a, soviet, reorganization, of, all, its, institutions, from, the, outset, the, leaders, of, this, new, state, held, that, film, would, be, the, most, ideal, propaganda, tool, for, the, soviet, union, because, of, its, widespread, popularity, among, the, established, citizenry, of, the, new, land, vladimir, lenin, viewed, film, as, the, most, important, medium, for, educating, the, masses, in, the, ways, means, and, successes, of, communism, as, a, consequence, lenin, issued, the, directives, on, the, film, business, on, january, 17, 1922, which, instructed, the, people, s, commissariat, for, education, to, systemise, the, film, business, registering, and, numbering, all, films, shown, in, the, russian, soviet, federative, socialist, republic, extracting, rent, from, all, privately, owned, cinemas, and, subject, them, to, censorship, joseph, stalin, later, also, regarded, cinema, as, of, the, prime, importance, however, between, world, war, i, and, the, russian, revolution, the, russian, film, industry, and, the, infrastructure, needed, to, support, it, e, g, electrical, power, had, deteriorated, to, the, point, of, unworkability, the, majority, of, cinemas, had, been, in, the, corridor, between, moscow, and, saint, petersburg, and, most, were, out, of, commission, additionally, many, of, the, performers, producers, directors, and, other, artists, of, pre, soviet, russia, had, fled, the, country, or, were, moving, ahead, of, red, army, forces, as, they, pushed, further, and, further, south, into, what, remained, of, the, russian, empire, furthermore, the, new, government, did, not, have, the, funds, to, spare, for, an, extensive, reworking, of, the, system, of, filmmaking, thus, they, initially, opted, for, project, approval, and, censorship, guidelines, while, leaving, what, remained, of, the, industry, in, private, hands, as, this, amounted, mostly, to, cinema, houses, the, first, soviet, films, consisted, of, recycled, films, of, the, russian, empire, and, its, imports, to, the, extent, that, these, were, not, determined, to, be, offensive, to, the, new, soviet, ideology, ironically, the, first, new, film, released, in, soviet, russia, did, not, exactly, fit, this, mold, this, was, father, sergius, a, religious, film, completed, during, the, last, weeks, of, the, russian, empire, but, not, yet, exhibited, it, appeared, on, soviet, screens, in, 1918, beyond, this, the, government, was, principally, able, to, fund, only, short, educational, films, the, most, famous, of, which, were, the, agitki, educational, films, intended, to, agitate, or, energize, and, enthuse, the, masses, to, participate, fully, in, approved, soviet, activities, and, deal, effectively, with, those, who, remained, in, opposition, to, the, new, order, these, short, often, one, small, reel, films, were, often, simple, visual, aids, and, accompaniments, to, live, lectures, and, speeches, and, were, carried, from, city, to, city, town, to, town, village, to, village, along, with, the, lecturers, to, educate, the, entire, countryside, even, reaching, areas, where, film, had, not, been, previously, seen, newsreels, as, documentaries, were, the, other, major, form, of, earliest, soviet, cinema, dziga, vertov, s, newsreel, series, kino, pravda, the, best, known, of, these, lasted, from, 1922, to, 1925, and, had, a, propagandistic, bent, vertov, used, the, series, to, promote, socialist, realism, but, also, to, experiment, with, cinema, still, in, 1921, there, was, not, one, functioning, cinema, in, moscow, until, late, in, the, year, its, rapid, success, using, old, russian, and, imported, feature, films, jumpstarted, the, industry, significantly, especially, insofar, as, the, government, did, not, heavily, or, directly, regulate, what, was, shown, and, by, 1923, an, additional, 89, cinemas, had, opened, despite, extremely, high, taxation, of, ticket, sales, and, film, rentals, there, was, an, incentive, for, individuals, to, begin, making, feature, film, product, again, there, were, places, to, show, the, films, albeit, they, now, had, to, conform, their, subject, matter, to, a, soviet, world, view, in, this, context, the, directors, and, writers, who, were, in, support, of, the, objectives, of, communism, assumed, quick, dominance, in, the, industry, as, they, were, the, ones, who, could, most, reliably, and, convincingly, turn, out, films, that, would, satisfy, government, censors, new, talent, joined, the, experienced, remainder, and, an, artistic, community, assembled, with, the, goal, of, defining, soviet, film, as, something, distinct, and, better, from, the, output, of, decadent, capitalism, the, leaders, of, this, community, viewed, it, essential, to, this, goal, to, be, free, to, experiment, with, the, entire, nature, of, film, a, position, which, would, result, in, several, well, known, creative, efforts, but, would, also, result, in, an, unforeseen, counter, reaction, by, the, increasingly, solidifying, administrators, of, the, government, controlled, society, in, 1924, nikolai, lebedev, wrote, a, book, on, the, history, of, film, he, says, is, the, first, soviet, attempt, at, systematization, of, the, meager, available, sources, for, the, general, reader, along, with, other, articles, written, by, lebedev, and, published, by, pravda, izvestia, and, kino, in, the, book, he, draws, attention, to, the, funding, challenges, that, follow, nationalization, of, soviet, cinema, in, 1925, all, film, organizations,

to, allow, development, of, more, human, characters, but, communism, still, had, to, remain, uncriticized, in, its, fundamentals, additionally, the, degree, of, relative, artistic, liberality, was,

and, exhibition, of, finished, films, with, central, planning, came, more, centralized, authority, over, creative, decision, making, script, development, became, a, long, torturous, process, under,

feature, film, projects, would, drag, out, for, months, or, years, and, might, be, terminated, at, any, point, alexander, dovzhenko, drew, from, ukrainian, folk, culture, in, such, films, as, earth, 1930, along, the, way, because, of, the, capricious, decision, of, one, or, another, censoring, committee, this, redundant, oversight, slowed, down, production, and, inhibited, creativity, although,

features, annually, at, the, end, of, the, nep, period, but, that, figure, fell, to, seventy, by, 1932, and, to, forty, five, by, 1934, it, never, again, reached, triple, digits, during, the, remainder, of, the, stalin, era, veteran, directors, experienced, precipitous, career, declines, under, this, system, of, control, whereas, eisenstein, was, able, to, make, four, features, between,

off, its, film, contacts, with, the, west, it, stopped, importing, films, after, 1931, out, of, concern, that, foreign, films, exposed, audiences, to, capitalist, ideology, the, industry, also, freed, itself, from, dependency, on, foreign, technologies, during, its, industrialization, effort, of, the, early, 1930s, the, ussr, finally, built, an, array, of, factories, to, supply, the, film, industry, with, the, nation, s, own, technical, resources, to, secure, independence, from, the, west, industry, leaders, mandated, that, the, ussr, develop, its, own, sound, technologies, rather, than, taking, licenses, on, western, sound, systems, two, soviet, scientists, alexander, shorin, in, leningrad, present, day, st, petersburg, and, pavel, tager, in, moscow, conducted, research, through, the, late, 1920s, on, complementary, sound, systems, which, were, ready, for, use, by, 1930, the, implementation, process, including, the, cost, of, refitting, movie, theaters, proved, daunting, and, the, ussr, did, not, complete, the, transition, to, sound, until, 1935, nevertheless, several, directors, made, innovative, use, of, sound, once, the, technology, became, available, in, enthusiasm, the, symphony, of, donbass, 1930, his, documentary, on, coal, mining, and, heavy, industry, dziga, vertov, based, his, soundtrack, on, an, elegantly, orchestrated, array, of, industrial, noises, in, the, deserter, 1933, pudovkin, experimented, with, a, form, of, sound, counterpoint, by, exploiting, tensions, and, ironic, dissonances, between, sound, elements, and, the, image, track, and, in, alexander, nevsky, eisenstein, collaborated, with, the, composer, sergei, prokofiev, on, an, operatic, film, style, that, elegantly, coordinated, the, musical, score, and, the, image, track, as, soviet, cinema, made, the, transition, to, sound, and, central, planning, in, the, early, 1930s, it, was, also, put, under, a, mandate, to, adopt, a, uniform, film, style, commonly, identified, as, socialist, realism, in, 1932, the, party, leadership, ordered, the, literary, community, to, abandon, the, avant, garde, practices, of, the, 1920s, and, to, embrace, socialist, realism, a, literary, style, that, in, practice, was, actually, close, to, 19th, century, realism, the, other, arts, including, cinema, were, subsequently, instructed, to, develop, the, aesthetic, equivalent, for, cinema, this, meant, adopting, a, film, style, that, would, be, legible, to, a, broad, audience, thus, avoiding, a, possible, split, between, the, avant, garde, and, mainstream, cinema, that, was, evident, in, the, late, 1920s, the, director, of, soyuzkino, and, later, gukf, boris, shumyatsky, 1886, 1938, served, as, chief, executive, of, the, soviet, film, industry, from, 1931, to, 1938, and, was, a, harsh, critic, of, the, montage, aesthetic, he, championed, a, cinema, for, the, millions, which, would, use, clear, linear, narration, although, american, movies, were, no, longer, being, imported, in, the, 1930s, the, hollywood, model, of, continuity, editing, was, readily, available, and, it, had, a, successful, track, record, with, soviet, movie, audiences, soviet, socialist, realism, was, built, on, this, style, which, assured, tidy, storytelling, various, other, strictures, were, then, added, to, the, doctrine, positive, heroes, to, act, as, role, models, for, viewers, lessons, in, good, citizenship, for, spectators, to, embrace, and, support, for, reigning, policy, decisions, of, the, communist, party, such, aesthetic, policies, enforced, by, the, rigorous, censorship, apparatus, of, the, ussr, resulted, in, a, number, of, formulaic, films, apparently, they, did, succeed, in, sustaining, a, true, cinema, of, the, masses, the, 1930s, witnessed, some, stellar, examples, of, popular, cinema, the, single, most, successful, film, of, the, decade, in, terms, of, both, official, praise, and, genuine, affection, from, the, mass, audience, was, chapaev, 1934, directed, by, the, vasilyev, brothers, based, on, the, life, of, a, martyred, red, army, commander, the, film, was, touted, as, a, model, of, socialist, realism, in, that, chapayev, and, his, followers, battled, heroically, for, the, revolutionary, cause, the, film, also, humanized, the, title, character, giving, him, personal, foibles, an, ironic, sense, of, humour, and, a, rough, peasant, charm, these, qualities, endeared, him, to, the, viewing, public, spectators, reported, seeing, the, film, multiple, times, during, its, first, run, in, 1934, and, chapaev, was, periodically, re, released, for, subsequent, generations, of, audiences, a, genre, that, emerged, in, the, 1930s, to, consistent, popular, acclaim, was, the, musical, comedy, and, a, master, of, that, form, was, grigori, aleksandrov, 1903, 1984, he, effected, a, creative, partnership, with, his, wife, the, brilliant, comic, actress, and, chanteuse, lyubov, orlova, 1902, 1975, in, a, series, of, crowd, pleasing, musicals, their, pastoral, comedy, volga, volga, 1938, was, surpassed, only, by, chapaev, in, terms, of, box, office, success, the, fantasy, element, of, their, films, with, lively, musical, numbers, reviving, the, montage, aesthetic, sometimes, stretched, the, boundaries, of, socialist, realism, but, the, genre, could, also, allude, to, contemporary, affairs, in, aleksandrov, s, 1940, musical, tanya, orlova, plays, a, humble, servant, girl, who, rises, through, the, ranks, of, the, soviet, industrial, leadership, after, developing, clever, labour, saving, work, methods, audiences, could, enjoy, the, film, s, comic, turn, on, the, cinderella, story, while, also, learning, about, the, value, of, efficiency, in, the, workplace, immediately, after, the, end, of, the, second, world, war, color, movies, such, as, the, stone, flower, 1946, ballad, of, siberia, 1947, and, cossacks, of, the, kuban, 1949, were, released, other, notable, films, from, the, 1940s, include, the, black, and, white, films, alexander, nevsky, ivan, the, terrible, and, encounter, at, the, elbe, the, soviet, film, industry, suffered, during, the, period, after, world, war, ii, on, top, of, dealing, with,

people, the, postwar, period, was, marked, by, an, end, of, almost, all, autonomy, in, the, soviet, union, the, catalogue, of, soviet, films, recorded, remarkably, low, numbers, of, films, being, produced, from, 1945, to, 1953, with, as, few, as, nine, films, produced, in, 1951, and, a, maximum, of, twenty, three, produced, in, 1952, these, numbers, do, not, however, include, many, of, the, works, which, are, not, generally, considered, to, be, film, in, an, elitist, sense, such, as, filmed, versions, of, theatrical, works, and, operas, feature, length, event, documentaries, and, travelogues, short, films, for, children, and, experimental, stereoscopic, films, but, compared, to, the, four, hundred, to, five, hundred, films, produced, every, year, by, hollywood, the, soviet, film, industry, was, practically, dead, even, as, the, economy, of, the, soviet, union, strengthened, film, production, continued, to, decrease, a, resolution, passed, by, the, council, of, ministers, in, 1948, further, crippled, the, film, industry, the, resolution, criticized, the, work, of, the, industry, saying, that, an, emphasis, placed, on, quantity, over, quality, had, ideologically, weakened, the, films, instead, the, council, insisted, that, every, film, produced, must, be, a, masterpiece, for, promoting, communist, ideas, and, the, soviet, system, often, stalin, had, the, ultimate, decision, on, whether, a, newly, produced, film, was, appropriate, for, public, viewing, in, private, screenings, after, meetings, of, the, politburo, the, minister, of, the, film, industry, ivan, bolshakov, privately, screened, films, for, stalin, and, top, members, of, soviet, government, the, strict, limitations, on, content, and, complex, centralized, process, for, approval, drove,

problem, of, satisfying, the, growing, appetites, of, soviet, audiences, for, films, while, dealing, with, the, shortage, of, newly, produced, works, from, studios, in, response, cinemas, played, the, same, films, for, months, at, a, time, many, of, them, the, works, of, the, late, 1930s, anything, new, drew, millions, of, people, to, the, box, office, and, many, theaters, screened, foreign, films, to, attract, larger, audiences, most, of, these, foreign, films, were, trophy, films, two, thousand, films, brought, into, the, country, by, the, red, army, after, the, occupation, of, germany, and, eastern, europe, in, world, war, ii, in, the, top, secret, minutes, for, the, cpsu, committee, meeting, on, august, 31, 1948, the, committee, permitted, the, minister, of, the, film, industry, to, release, fifty, of, these, films, in, the, soviet, union, of, these, fifty, bolshakov, was, only, allowed, to, release, twenty, four, for, screening, to, the, general, public, mainly, films, made, in, germany, austria, italy, and, france, the, other, twenty, six, films, consisting, almost, entirely, of, american, films, were, only, allowed, to, be, shown, in, private, screenings, the, minutes, also, include, a, separate, list, of, permitted, german, musical, films, which, were, mainly, german, and, italian, film, adaptations, of, famous, operas, most, of, the, trophy, films, were, released, in, 1948, 49, but, somewhat, strangely, compiled, lists, of, the, released, films, include, ones, not, previously, mentioned, in, the, official, minutes, of, the, central, committee, the, public, release, of, these, trophy, films, seems, contradictory, in, the, context, of, the, 1940s, soviet, union, the, soviet, government, allowed, the, exhibition, of, foreign, films, which, contained, far, more, subversive, ideas, than, any, a, soviet, director, would, have, ever, attempted, putting, in, a, film, at, a, time, when, soviet, artists, found, themselves, unemployed, because, of, censorship, laws, historians, hypothesize, many, possible, reasons, why, the, soviet, government, showed, such, seemingly, inexplicable, leniency, toward, the, foreign, films, the, government, may, have, granted, cinemas, the, right, to, show, the, films, so, they, could, stay, in, business, after, the, domestic, film, industry, had, declined, a, second, hypothesis, speculates, that, the, government, saw, the, films, as, an, easy, source, of, money, to, help, rebuild, the, nation, after, the, war, the, minutes, of, the, cpsu, central, committee, meeting, seem, to, support, the, latter, idea, with, instructions, that, the, films, are, to, bring, in, a, net, income, of, at, least, 750, million, roubles, to, the, state, coffers, over, the, course, of, a, year, from, public, and, private, screenings, and, 250, million, roubles, of, this, were, supposed, to, come, from, rentals, to, the, trade, union, camera, network, in, addition, to, releasing, the, films, the, committee, also, charged, bolshakov, and, the, agitation, and, propaganda, department, of, the, cpsu, central, committee, with, making, the, necessary, editorial, corrections, to, the, films, and, with, providing, an, introductory, text, and, carefully, edited, subtitles, for, each, film, in, general, the, captured, nazi, films, were, considered, apolitical, enough, to, be, shown, to, the, general, populace, still, the, propaganda, and, agitation, section, of, the, central, committee, ran, into, trouble, with, the, censoring, of, two, films, slated, for, release, the, censors, found, it, impossible, to, remove, the, zionist, ideas, from, jud, suss, an, anti, semitic, nazi, propaganda, film, the, censors, also, had, trouble, with, a, film, adaptation, of, of, mice, and, men, because, of, the, representation, of, the, poor, as, a, detriment, to, society, there, is, very, little, direct, evidence, of, how, soviet, audiences, received, the, trophy, films, soviet, magazines, or, newspapers, never, reviewed, the, films, there, were, no, audience, surveys, and, no, records, exist, of, how, many, people, viewed, the, films, to, judge, the, reception, and, popularity, of, these, foreign, films, historians, have, mainly, relied, on, anecdotal, evidence, the, german, musical, comedy, the, woman, of, my, dreams, received, mixed, reviews, according, to, this, evidence, kultura, i, zhizn, published, a, supposed, survey, compiled, of, readers, letters, to, the, editor, in, march, 1947, which, criticize, the, film, for, being, idealess, low, brow, and, even, harmful, bulat, okudzhava, wrote, a, contradicting, viewpoint, in, druzhba, narodov, in, 1986, saying, that, everyone, in, the, city, of, tbilisi, was, crazy, about, the, film, according, to, him, everywhere, he, went, people, were, talking, about, the, film, and, whistling, the, songs, of, the, two, accounts, film, historians, generally, consider, okudzhava, s, more, reliable, than, the, one, presented, by, kultura, i, zhizn, films, such, as, his, butler, s, sister, the, thief, of, bagdad, waterloo, bridge, and, sun, valley, serenade, although, not, technically, trophies, as, they, had, been, purchased, legally, during, the, wartime, alliance, with, america, were, highly, popular, with, soviet, audiences, in, vechernyaya, moskva, october, 4, 1946, m, chistiakov, reprimanded, theaters, and, the, soviet, film, industry, for, the, fact, that, over, a, six, month, timespan, sixty, of, the, films, shown, had, been, tasteless, western, films, rather, than, soviet, ones, even, in, criticism, of, the, films, and, the, crusading, efforts, of, the, anti, cosmopolitan, campaign, against, the, trophy, films, it, is, clear, to, see, they, had, quite, an, impact, on, soviet, society, with, the, start, of, the, cold, war, writers, still, considered, the, primary, auteurs, were, all, the, more, reluctant, to, take, up, script, writing, and, the, early, 1950s, saw, only, a, handful, of, feature, films, completed, during, any, year, the, death, of, stalin, was, a, relief, to, some, people, and, all, the, more, so, was, the, official, trashing, of, his, public, image, as, a, benign, and, competent, leader, by, nikita, khrushchev, two, years, later, this, latter, event, gave, filmmakers, the, margin, of, comfort, they, needed, to, move, away, from, the, narrow, stories, of, socialist, realism, expand, its, boundaries, and, begin, work, on, a, wider, range, of, entertaining, and, artistic, soviet, films, notable, films, include, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, saw, the, creation, of, many, films, many, of, which, molded, soviet, and, post, soviet, culture, they, include, since, films, were, publicly, funded, by, goskino, soviet, directors, were, not, preoccupied, with, commercial, pressures, this, contributed, to, the, creation, of, philosophical, and, poetic, films, scripts, had, to, be, approved, by, a, goskino, committee, before, the, director, would, receive, funding, and, the, production, could, be, greenlighted, but, in, most, cases, this, did, not, amount, to, brazen, censorship, as, such, the, directors, andrei, tarkovsky, sergei, parajanov, and, nikita, mikhalkov, became, known, for, the, poetic, quality, of, their, films, in, keeping, with, russian, culture, tragi, comedies, were, very, popular, these, decades, were, also, prominent, in, the, production, of, the, eastern,
