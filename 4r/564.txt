the, last, supper, italian, il, cenacolo, or, l, ultima, cena, is, a, mural, painting, by, the, italian, high, renaissance, artist, leonardo, da, vinci, dated, to, c, 1495, 1498, housed, in, the, refectory, of, the, convent, of, santa, maria, delle, grazie, in, milan, italy, the, painting, represents, the, scene, of, the, last, supper, of, jesus, with, the, twelve, apostles, as, it, is, told, in, the, gospel, of, john, specifically, the, moment, after, jesus, announces, that, one, of, his, apostles, will, betray, him, its, handling, of, space, mastery, of, perspective, treatment, of, motion, and, complex, display, of, human, emotion, has, made, it, one, of, the, western, world, s, most, recognizable, paintings, and, among, leonardo, s, most, celebrated, works, some, commentators, consider, it, pivotal, in, inaugurating, the, transition, into, what, is, now, termed, the, high, renaissance, the, work, was, commissioned, as, part, of, a, plan, of, renovations, to, the, church, and, its, convent, buildings, by, leonardo, s, patron, ludovico, sforza, duke, of, milan, in, order, to, permit, his, inconsistent, painting, schedule, and, frequent, revisions, it, is, painted, with, materials, that, allowed, for, regular, alterations, tempera, on, gesso, pitch, and, mastic, due, to, the, methods, used, a, variety, of, environmental, factors, and, intentional, damage, little, of, the, original, painting, remains, today, despite, numerous, restoration, attempts, the, last, being, completed, in, 1999, the, last, supper, is, leonardo, s, largest, work, aside, from, the, sala, delle, asse, the, last, supper, measures, 460, cm, 880, cm, 180, in, 350, in, and, covers, an, end, wall, of, the, dining, hall, at, the, monastery, of, santa, maria, delle, grazie, in, milan, italy, the, theme, was, a, traditional, one, for, refectories, although, the, room, was, not, a, refectory, at, the, time, that, leonardo, painted, it, the, main, church, building, was, still, under, construction, while, leonardo, was, composing, the, painting, leonardo, s, patron, ludovico, sforza, planned, that, the, church, should, be, remodeled, as, a, family, mausoleum, to, this, end, changes, were, made, perhaps, to, plans, by, donato, bramante, these, plans, were, not, fully, carried, out, and, a, smaller, mortuary, chapel, was, constructed, adjacent, to, the, cloister, the, painting, was, commissioned, by, sforza, to, decorate, the, wall, of, the, mausoleum, the, lunettes, above, the, main, painting, formed, by, the, triple, arched, ceiling, of, the, refectory, are, painted, with, sforza, coats, of, arms, the, opposite, wall, of, the, refectory, is, covered, by, the, crucifixion, fresco, by, giovanni, donato, da, montorfano, to, which, leonardo, added, figures, of, the, sforza, family, in, tempera, these, figures, have, deteriorated, in, much, the, same, way, as, has, the, last, supper, leonardo, worked, on, the, last, supper, from, about, 1495, to, 1498, but, he, did, not, work, continuously, the, beginning, date, is, not, certain, as, the, archives, of, the, convent, for, the, period, have, been, destroyed, a, document, dated, 1497, indicates, that, the, painting, was, nearly, completed, at, that, date, a, prior, from, the, monastery, reportedly, complained, to, leonardo, about, its, delay, leonardo, wrote, to, the, head, of, the, monastery, explaining, he, had, been, struggling, to, find, the, perfect, villainous, face, for, judas, and, that, if, he, could, not, find, a, face, corresponding, with, what, he, had, in, mind, he, would, use, the, features, of, the, prior, who, had, complained, in, 1557, gian, paolo, lomazzo, wrote, that, leonardo, s, friend, bernardo, zenale, advised, him, to, leave, christ, s, face, unfinished, arguing, that, it, would, be, impossible, to, imagine, faces, lovelier, or, gentler, than, those, of, james, the, greater, or, james, the, less, leonardo, apparently, took, the, advice, leonardo, as, a, painter, favoured, oil, painting, a, medium, which, allows, the, artist, to, work, slowly, and, make, changes, with, ease, fresco, painting, does, not, facilitate, either, of, these, objectives, leonardo, also, sought, a, greater, luminosity, and, intensity, of, light, and, shade, chiaroscuro, than, could, be, achieved, with, fresco, in, which, the, water, soluble, colours, are, painted, onto, wet, plaster, laid, freshly, each, day, in, sections, rather, than, using, the, proven, method, of, painting, on, walls, leonardo, painted, the, last, supper, in, tempera, the, medium, generally, used, for, panel, painting, the, painting, is, on, a, stone, wall, sealed, with, a, double, layer, of, gesso, pitch, and, mastic, then, he, added, an, undercoat, of, white, lead, to, enhance, the, brightness, of, the, tempera, that, was, applied, on, top, this, was, a, method, that, had, been, described, previously, by, cennino, cennini, in, the, 14th, century, however, cennini, described, the, technique, as, being, more, risky, than, fresco, painting, and, recommended, the, use, of, painting, in, a, more, superficial, medium, for, the, final, touches, only, the, last, supper, portrays, the, reaction, given, by, each, apostle, when, jesus, said, one, of, them, would, betray, him, all, twelve, apostles, have, different, reactions, to, the, news, with, various, degrees, of, anger, and, shock, the, apostles, were, identified, by, their, names, using, an, unsigned, mid, sixteenth, century, fresco, copy, of, leonardo, s, cenacolo, before, this, only, judas, peter, john, and, jesus, had, been, positively, identified, from, left, to, right, according, to, the, apostles, heads, in, common, with, other, depictions, of, the, last, supper, from, this, period, leonardo, seats, the, diners, on, one, side, of, the, table, so, that, none, of, them, has, his, back, to, the, viewer, the, tablecloth, is, white, with, blue, stripes, which, are, colours, commonly, associated, with, the, jewish, people, this, is, the, painting, s, only, overt, reference, to, the, ethnicity, of, jesus, and, his, disciples, most, previous, depictions, excluded, judas, by, placing, him, alone, on, the, opposite, side, of, the, table, from, the, other, eleven, disciples, and, jesus, or, placing, halos, around, all, the, disciples, except, judas, leonardo, instead, has, judas, lean, back, into, shadow, jesus, is, predicting, that, his, betrayer, will, take, the, bread, at, the, same, time, he, does, to, thomas, and, james, the, greater, to, his, left, who, react, in, horror, as, jesus, points, with, his, left, hand, to, a, piece, of, bread, before, them, distracted, by, the, conversation, between, john, and, peter, judas, reaches, for, a, different, piece, of, bread, not, noticing, jesus, too, stretching, out, with, his, right, hand, towards, it, matthew, 26, 23, the, angles, and, lighting, draw, attention, to, jesus, whose, turned, right, cheek, is, located, at, the, vanishing, point, for, all, perspective, lines, in, addition, the, painting, demonstrated, leonardo, s, masterful, use, of, perspective, as, it, draws, our, attention, to, the, face, of, christ, at, the, center, of, the, composition, and, christ, s, face, through, his, down, turned, gaze, directs, our, focus, along, the, diagonal, of, his, left, arm, to, his, hand, and, therefore, the, bread, leonardo, reportedly, used, the, likenesses, of, people, in, and, around, milan, as, inspiration, for, the, painting, s, figures, the, convent, s, prior, complained, to, sforza, of, leonardo, s, laziness, as, he, wandered, the, streets, to, find, a, criminal, to, base, judas, on, leonardo, responded, that, if, he, could, find, no, one, else, the, prior, would, make, a, suitable, model, while, the, painting, was, being, executed, leonardo, s, friend, the, mathematician, luca, pacioli, called, it, a, symbol, of, man, s, burning, desire, for, salvation, two, early, copies, of, the, last, supper, are, known, to, exist, presumed, to, be, work, by, leonardo, s, assistants, the, copies, are, almost, the, size, of, the, original, and, have, survived, with, a, wealth, of, original, detail, still, intact, one, by, giampietrino, is, in, the, collection, of, the, royal, academy, of, arts, london, and, the, other, by, cesare, da, sesto, is, installed, at, the, church, of, st, ambrogio, in, ponte, capriasca, switzerland, a, third, copy, oil, on, canvas, is, painted, by, andrea, solari, c, 1520, and, is, on, display, in, the, leonardo, da, vinci, museum, of, the, tongerlo, abbey, belgium, because, sforza, had, ordered, the, church, to, be, rebuilt, hastily, the, masons, filled, the, walls, with, moisture, retaining, rubble, the, painting, was, done, on, a, thin, exterior, wall, so, the, effects, of, humidity, were, felt, keenly, and, the, paint, failed, to, properly, adhere, to, it, because, of, the, method, used, soon, after, the, painting, was, completed, on, 9, february, 1498, it, began, to, deteriorate, in, 1499, louis, xii, contemplated, removing, the, painting, from, the, wall, and, taking, it, to, france, as, early, as, 1517, the, painting, was, starting, to, flake, and, in, 1532, gerolamo, cardano, described, it, as, blurred, and, colorless, compared, with, what, i, remember, of, it, when, i, saw, it, as, a, boy, by, 1556, fewer, than, sixty, years, after, it, was, finished, giorgio, vasari, described, the, painting, as, reduced, to, a, muddle, of, blots, so, deteriorated, that, the, figures, were, unrecognizable, by, the, second, half, of, the, 16th, century, gian, paolo, lomazzo, stated, that, the, painting, is, all, ruined, in, 1652, a, doorway, was, cut, through, the, then, unrecognisable, painting, and, later, bricked, up, this, can, still, be, seen, as, the, irregular, arch, shaped, structure, near, the, center, base, of, the, painting, it, is, believed, through, early, copies, that, jesus, feet, were, in, a, position, symbolizing, the, forthcoming, crucifixion, in, 1768, a, curtain, was, hung, over, the, painting, intended, for, its, protection, the, curtain, instead, trapped, moisture, on, the, surface, and, whenever, it, was, pulled, back, it, scratched, the, flaking, paint, a, first, restoration, was, attempted, in, 1726, by, michelangelo, bellotti, who, filled, in, missing, sections, with, oil, paint, then, varnished, the, whole, mural, this, repair, did, not, last, well, and, another, restoration, was, attempted, in, 1770, by, an, otherwise, unknown, artist, named, giuseppe, mazza, mazza, stripped, off, bellotti, s, work, then, largely, repainted, the, painting, he, had, redone, all, but, three, faces, when, he, was, halted, due, to, public, outrage, in, 1796, french, revolutionary, anti, clerical, troops, used, the, refectory, as, an, armory, and, stable, they, threw, stones, at, the, painting, and, climbed, ladders, to, scratch, out, the, apostles, eyes, goethe, wrote, that, in, 1800, the, room, was, flooded, with, two, feet, of, water, after, a, heavy, rainstorm, the, refectory, was, used, as, a, prison, it, is, not, known, if, any, of, the, prisoners, may, have, damaged, the, painting, in, 1821, stefano, barezzi, an, expert, in, removing, whole, frescoes, from, their, walls, intact, was, called, in, to, remove, the, painting, to, a, safer, location, he, badly, damaged, the, center, section, before, realizing, that, leonardo, s, work, was, not, a, fresco, barezzi, then, attempted, to, reattach, damaged, sections, with, glue, from, 1901, to, 1908, luigi, cavenaghi, first, completed, a, careful, study, of, the, structure, of, the, painting, then, began, cleaning, it, in, 1924, oreste, silvestri, did, further, cleaning, and, stabilised, some, parts, with, stucco, during, world, war, ii, on, 15, august, 1943, the, refectory, was, struck, by, allied, bombing, protective, sandbagging, prevented, the, painting, from, being, struck, by, bomb, splinters, but, it, may, have, been, damaged, by, the, vibration, between, 1946, and, 1954, mauro, pellicioli, undertook, a, clean, and, stabilise, restoration, which, brera, director, fernanda, wittgens, was, involved, in, pellicioli, reattached, paint, to, the, wall, using, a, clear, shellac, making, it, relatively, darker, and, more, colorful, and, removed, some, of, the, overpainting, however, as, of, 1972, the, repainting, done, in, various, restorations, had, made, the, heads, of, saints, peter, andrew, and, james, differ, significantly, from, the, original, design, the, painting, s, appearance, by, the, late, 1970s, had, badly, deteriorated, from, 1978, to, 1999, pinin, brambilla, barcilon, guided, a, major, restoration, project, to, stabilize, the, painting, and, reverse, the, damage, caused, by, dirt, and, pollution, the, eighteenth, and, nineteenth, century, restoration, attempts, were, also, reversed, since, it, had, proved, impractical, to, move, the, painting, to, a, more, controlled, environment, the, refectory, was, instead, converted, to, a, sealed, climate, controlled, environment, which, meant, bricking, up, the, windows, then, detailed, study, was, undertaken, to, determine, the, painting, s, original, form, using, scientific, tests, especially, infrared, reflectoscopy, and, microscopic, core, samples, and, original, cartoons, preserved, in, the, royal, library, at, windsor, castle, some, areas, were, deemed, unrestorable, these, were, re, painted, using, watercolor, in, subdued, colors, intended, to, indicate, they, were, not, original, work, while, not, being, too, distracting, this, restoration, took, 21, years, and, on, 28, may, 1999, the, painting, was, returned, to, display, intending, visitors, were, required, to, book, ahead, and, could, only, stay, for, 15, minutes, when, it, was, unveiled, considerable, controversy, was, aroused, by, the, dramatic, changes, in, colors, tones, and, even, some, facial, shapes, james, beck, professor, of, art, history, at, columbia, university, and, founder, of, artwatch, international, had, been, a, particularly, strong, critic, michael, daley, director, of, artwatch, uk, has, also, complained, about, the, restored, version, of, the, painting, he, has, been, critical, of, christ, s, right, arm, in, the, image, which, has, been, altered, from, a, draped, sleeve, to, what, daley, calls, muff, like, drapery, the, last, supper, has, frequently, been, referenced, reproduced, or, parodied, in, western, culture, some, of, the, more, notable, examples, are,

widely, criticised, by, some, christian, conservatives, and, religious, leaders, who, alleged, that, it, was, mocking, christianity, this, claim, was, later, debunked, when, the, olympic, world, library, published, the, media, guide, written, before, the, ceremony, which, mentioned, it, being, a, homage, to, cultural, festivities, as, the, segment, is, actually, called, festivit, festivity, celebration, according, to, georgian, fact, checking, website, myth, detector, many, experts, had, pointed, out, the, differences, between, the, fresco, and, the, segment, the, last, supper, has, been, the, target, of, much, speculation, by, writers, and, historical, revisionists, alike, usually, centered, on, purported, hidden, messages, or, hints, found, within, the, painting, especially, since, the, publication, of, dan, brown, s, novel, the, da, vinci, code, 2003, in, which, one, of, the, characters, suggests, that, the, person, to, jesus, right, left, of, jesus, from, the, viewer, s, perspective, is, actually, mary, magdalene, it, also, states, that, there, was, a, letter, glaring, in, the, center, of, the, painting, m, standing, for, matrimonio, or, mary, magdalene, this, speculation, originated, in, earlier, books, the, templar, revelation, 1997, by, lynn, picknett, and, the, holy, blood, and, the, holy, grail, by, michael, baigent, henry, lincoln, and, richard, leigh, 1982, art, historians, hold, that, the, figure, is, the, apostle, john, who, appears, feminine, in, line, with, leonardo, s, characteristic, fascination, with, blurring, the, lines, between, the, sexes, a, quality, which, is, found, in, his, other, paintings, such, as, st, john, the, baptist, painted, c, 1513, 1516, christopher, l, hodapp, and, alice, von, kannon, comment, if, he, looks, effeminate, and, needs, a, haircut, so, does, james, the, second, figure, on, the, left, according, to, ross, king, an, expert, on, italian, art, mary, magdalene, s, appearance, at, the, last, supper, would, not, have, been, controversial, and, leonardo, would, have, had, no, motive, to, disguise, her, as, one, of, the, other, disciples, since, she, was, widely, venerated, in, her, role, as, the, apostle, to, the, apostles, and, was, the, patron, of, the, dominican, order, for, whom, the, last, supper, was, painted, there, would, have, even, been, precedent, for, it, since, the, earlier, italian, renaissance, painter, fra, angelico, had, included, her, in, his, painting, of, the, last, supper, the, painting, contains, several, possible, numerical, references, including, to, the, number, three, the, apostles, are, seated, in, groups, of, three, there, are, three, windows, behind, jesus, and, the, shape, of, jesus, figure, resembles, a, triangle, his, hands, are, located, at, the, golden, ratio, of, half, the, height, of, the, composition, the, painting, can, also, be, interpreted, using, the, fibonacci, series, one, table, one, central, figure, two, side, walls, three, windows, and, figures, grouped, in, threes, five, groups, of, figures, eight, panels, on, the, walls, and, eight, table, legs, and, thirteen, individual, figures, debates, among, art, historians, still, surround, the, use, of, the, fibonacci, series, as, some, argue, that, its, purposeful, use, did, not, fully, begin, to, be, applied, to, architecture, until, the, early, 19th, century
