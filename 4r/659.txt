editor, in, chief, perry, white, and, his, enemies, include, brainiac, general, zod, and, archenemy, lex, luthor, superman, is, the, archetype, of, the, superhero, he, wears, an, outlandish, costume, uses, a, codename, and, fights, evil, with, the, aid, of, extraordinary, abilities, although, there, are, earlier, characters, who, arguably, fit, this, definition, superman, popularized, the, superhero, genre, and, established, its, conventions, he, was, the, best, selling, superhero, in, american, comic, books, up, until, the, 1980s, jerry, siegel, and, joe, shuster, met, in, 1932, while, attending, glenville, high, school, in, cleveland, and, bonded, over, their, admiration, of, fiction, siegel, aspired, to, become, a, writer, and, shuster, aspired, to, become, an, illustrator, siegel, wrote, amateur, science, fiction, stories, which, he, self, published, as, a, magazine, called, science, fiction, the, advance, guard, of, future, civilization, his, friend, shuster, often, provided, illustrations, for, his, work, in, january, 1933, siegel, published, a, short, story, in, his, magazine, titled, the, reign, of, the, superman, the, titular, character, is, a, homeless, man, named, bill, dunn, who, is, tricked, by, an, evil, scientist, into, consuming, an, experimental, drug, the, drug, gives, dunn, the, powers, of, mind, reading, mind, control, and, clairvoyance, he, uses, these, powers, maliciously, for, profit, and, amusement, but, then, the, drug, wears, off, leaving, him, a, powerless, vagrant, again, shuster, provided, illustrations, depicting, dunn, as, a, bald, man, siegel, and, shuster, shifted, to, making, comic, strips, with, a, focus, on, adventure, and, comedy, they, wanted, to, become, syndicated, newspaper, strip, authors, so, they, showed, their, ideas, to, various, newspaper, editors, however, the, newspaper, editors, were, not, impressed, and, told, them, that, if, they, wanted, to, make, a, successful, comic, strip, it, had, to, be, something, more, sensational, than, anything, else, on, the, market, this, prompted, siegel, to, revisit, superman, as, a, comic, strip, character, siegel, modified, superman, s, powers, to, make, him, even, more, sensational, like, bill, dunn, the, second, prototype, of, superman, is, given, powers, against, his, will, by, an, unscrupulous, scientist, but, instead, of, psychic, abilities, he, acquires, superhuman, strength, and, bullet, proof, skin, additionally, this, new, superman, was, a, crime, fighting, hero, instead, of, a, villain, because, siegel, noted, that, comic, strips, with, heroic, protagonists, tended, to, be, more, successful, in, later, years, siegel, once, recalled, that, this, superman, wore, a, bat, like, cape, in, some, panels, but, typically, he, and, shuster, agreed, there, was, no, costume, yet, and, there, is, none, apparent, in, the, surviving, artwork, siegel, and, shuster, showed, this, second, concept, of, superman, to, consolidated, book, publishers, based, in, chicago, in, may, 1933, consolidated, had, published, a, proto, comic, book, titled, detective, dan, secret, operative, 48, it, contained, all, original, stories, as, opposed, to, reprints, of, newspaper, strips, which, was, a, novelty, at, the, time, siegel, and, shuster, put, together, a, comic, book, in, a, similar, format, called, the, superman, a, delegation, from, consolidated, visited, cleveland, that, summer, on, a, business, trip, and, siegel, and, shuster, took, the, opportunity, to, present, their, work, in, person, although, consolidated, expressed, interest, they, later, pulled, out, of, the, comics, business, without, ever, offering, a, book, deal, because, the, sales, of, detective, dan, were, disappointing, siegel, believed, publishers, kept, rejecting, them, because, he, and, shuster, were, young, and, unknown, so, he, looked, for, an, established, artist, to, replace, shuster, when, siegel, told, shuster, what, he, was, doing, shuster, reacted, by, burning, their, rejected, superman, comic, sparing, only, the, cover, they, continued, collaborating, on, other, projects, but, for, the, time, being, shuster, was, through, with, superman, siegel, wrote, to, numerous, artists, the, first, response, came, in, july, 1933, from, leo, o, mealia, who, drew, the, fu, manchu, strip, for, the, bell, syndicate, in, the, script, that, siegel, sent, to, o, mealia, superman, s, origin, story, changes, he, is, a, scientist, adventurer, from, the, far, future, when, humanity, has, naturally, evolved, superpowers, just, before, the, earth, explodes, he, escapes, in, a, time, machine, to, the, modern, era, whereupon, he, immediately, begins, using, his, superpowers, to, fight, crime, o, mealia, produced, a, few, strips, and, showed, them, to, his, newspaper, syndicate, but, they, were, rejected, o, mealia, did, not, send, to, siegel, any, copies, of, his, strips, and, they, have, been, lost, in, june, 1934, siegel, found, another, partner, an, artist, in, chicago, named, russell, keaton, keaton, drew, the, buck, rogers, and, skyroads, comic, strips, in, the, script, that, siegel, sent, keaton, in, june, superman, s, origin, story, further, evolved, in, the, distant, future, when, earth, is, on, the, verge, of, exploding, due, to, giant, cataclysms, the, last, surviving, man, sends, his, three, year, old, son, back, in, time, to, the, year, 1935, the, time, machine, appears, on, a, road, where, it, is, discovered, by, motorists, sam, and, molly, kent, they, leave, the, boy, in, an, orphanage, but, the, staff, struggle, to, control, him, because, he, has, superhuman, strength, and, impenetrable, skin, the, kents, adopt, the, boy, and, name, him, clark, and, teach, him, that, he, must, use, his, fantastic, natural, gifts, for, the, benefit, of, humanity, in, november, siegel, sent, keaton, an, extension, of, his, script, an, adventure, where, superman, foils, a, conspiracy, to, kidnap, a, star, football, player, the, extended, script, mentions, that, clark, puts, on, a, special, uniform, when, assuming, the, identity, of, superman, but, it, is, not, described, keaton, produced, two, weeks, worth, of, strips, based, on, siegel, s, script, in, november, keaton, showed, his, strips, to, a, newspaper, syndicate, but, they, too, were, rejected, and, he, abandoned, the, project, siegel, and, shuster, reconciled, and, resumed, developing, superman, together, the, character, became, an, alien, from, the, planet, krypton, shuster, designed, the, now, familiar, costume, tights, with, an, s, on, the, chest, over, shorts, and, a, cape, they, made, clark, kent, a, journalist, who, pretends, to, be, timid, and, conceived, his, colleague, lois, lane, who, is, attracted, to, the, bold, and, mighty, superman, but, does, not, realize, that, he, and, kent, are, the, same, person, in, june, 1935, siegel, and, shuster, finally, found, work, with, national, allied, publications, a, comic, magazine, publishing, company, in, new, york, owned, by, malcolm, wheeler, nicholson, wheeler, nicholson, published, two, of, their, strips, in, new, fun, comics, 6, 1935, henri, duval, and, doctor, occult, siegel, and, shuster, also, showed, him, superman, and, asked, him, to, market, superman, to, the, newspapers, on, their, behalf, in, october, wheeler, nicholson, offered, to, publish, superman, in, one, of, his, own, magazines, siegel, and, shuster, refused, his, offer, because, wheeler, nicholson, had, demonstrated, himself, to, be, an, irresponsible, businessman, he, had, been, slow, to, respond, to, their, letters, and, had, not, paid, them, for, their, work, in, new, fun, comics, 6, they, chose, to, keep, marketing, superman, to, newspaper, syndicates, themselves, despite, the, erratic, pay, siegel, and, shuster, kept, working, for, wheeler, nicholson, because, he, was, the, only, publisher, who, was, buying, their, work, and, over, the, years, they, produced, other, adventure, strips, for, his, magazines, wheeler, nicholson, s, financial, difficulties, continued, to, mount, in, 1936, he, formed, a, joint, corporation, with, harry, donenfeld, and, jack, liebowitz, called, detective, comics, inc, in, order, to, release, his, third, magazine, which, was, titled, detective, comics, siegel, and, shuster, produced, stories, for, detective, comics, too, such, as, slam, bradley, wheeler, nicholson, fell, into, deep, debt, to, donenfeld, and, liebowitz, and, in, early, january, 1938, donenfeld, and, liebowitz, petitioned, wheeler, nicholson, s, company, into, bankruptcy, and, seized, it, in, early, december, 1937, siegel, visited, liebowitz, in, new, york, and, liebowitz, asked, siegel, to, produce, some, comics, for, an, upcoming, comic, anthology, magazine, called, action, comics, siegel, proposed, some, new, stories, but, not, superman, siegel, and, shuster, were, at, the, time, negotiating, a, deal, with, the, mcclure, newspaper, syndicate, for, superman, in, early, january, 1938, siegel, had, a, three, way, telephone, conversation, with, liebowitz, and, an, employee, of, mcclure, named, max, gaines, gaines, informed, siegel, that, mcclure, had, rejected, superman, and, asked, if, he, could, forward, their, superman, strips, to, liebowitz, so, that, liebowitz, could, consider, them, for, action, comics, siegel, agreed, liebowitz, and, his, colleagues, were, impressed, by, the, strips, and, they, asked, siegel, and, shuster, to, develop, the, strips, into, 13, pages, for, action, comics, having, grown, tired, of, rejections, siegel, and, shuster, accepted, the, offer, at, least, now, they, would, see, superman, published, siegel, and, shuster, submitted, their, work, in, late, february, and, were, paid, 130, equivalent, to, 2, 814, in, 2023, for, their, work, 10, per, page, in, early, march, they, signed, a, contract, at, liebowitz, s, request, in, which, they, gave, away, the, copyright, for, superman, to, detective, comics, inc, this, was, normal, practice, in, the, business, and, siegel, and, shuster, had, given, away, the, copyrights, to, their, previous, works, as, well, the, duo, s, revised, version, of, superman, appeared, in, the, first, issue, of, action, comics, which, was, published, on, april, 18, 1938, the, issue, was, a, huge, success, thanks, to, superman, s, feature, siegel, and, shuster, read, pulp, science, fiction, and, adventure, magazines, and, many, stories, featured, characters, with, fantastical, abilities, such, as, telepathy, clairvoyance, and, superhuman, strength, one, character, in, particular, was, john, carter, of, mars, from, the, novels, by, edgar, rice, burroughs, john, carter, is, a, human, who, is, transported, to, mars, where, the, lower, gravity, makes, him, stronger, than, the, natives, and, allows, him, to, leap, great, distances, another, influence, was, philip, wylie, s, 1930, novel, gladiator, featuring, a, protagonist, named, hugo, danner, who, had, similar, powers, superman, s, stance, and, devil, may, care, attitude, were, influenced, by, the, characters, of, douglas, fairbanks, who, starred, in, adventure, films, such, as, the, mark, of, zorro, and, robin, hood, the, name, of, superman, s, home, city, metropolis, was, taken, from, the, 1927, film, of, the, same, name, popeye, cartoons, were, also, an, influence, clark, kent, s, harmless, facade, and, dual, identity, were, inspired, by, the, protagonists, of, such, movies, as, don, diego, de, la, vega, in, the, mark, of, zorro, and, sir, percy, blakeney, in, the, scarlet, pimpernel, siegel, thought, this, would, make, for, interesting, dramatic, contrast, and, good, humor, another, inspiration, was, slapstick, comedian, harold, lloyd, the, archetypal, lloyd, character, was, a, mild, mannered, man, who, finds, himself, abused, by, bullies, but, later, in, the, story, snaps, and, fights, back, furiously, kent, is, a, journalist, because, siegel, often, imagined, himself, becoming, one, after, leaving, school, the, love, triangle, between, lois, lane, clark, and, superman, was, inspired, by, siegel, s, own, awkwardness, with, girls, the, pair, collected, comic, strips, in, their, youth, with, a, favorite, being, winsor, mccay, s, fantastical, little, nemo, shuster, remarked, on, the, artists, who, played, an, important, part, in, the, development, of, his, own, style, alex, raymond, and, burne, hogarth, were, my, idols, also, milt, caniff, hal, foster, and, roy, crane, shuster, taught, himself, to, draw, by, tracing, over, the, art, in, the, strips, and, magazines, they, collected, as, a, boy, shuster, was, interested, in, fitness, culture, and, a, fan, of, strongmen, such, as, siegmund, breitbart, and, joseph, greenstein, he, collected, fitness, magazines, and, manuals, and, used, their, photographs, as, visual, references, for, his, art, the, visual, design, of, superman, came, from, multiple, influences, the, tight, fitting, suit, and, shorts, were, inspired, by, the, costumes, of, wrestlers, boxers, and, strongmen, in, early, concept, art, shuster, gave, superman, laced, sandals, like, those, of, strongmen, and, classical, heroes, but, these, were, eventually, changed, to, red, boots, the, costumes, of, douglas, fairbanks, were, also, an, influence, the, emblem, on, his, chest, was, inspired, by, heraldic, crests, many, pulp, action, heroes, such, as, swashbucklers, wore, capes, superman, s, face, was, based, on, johnny, weissmuller, with, touches, derived, from, the, comic, strip, character, dick, tracy, and, from, the, work, of, cartoonist, roy, crane, the, word, superman, was, commonly, used, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, to, describe, men, of, great, ability, most, often, athletes, and, politicians, it, occasionally, appeared, in, pulp, fiction, stories, as, well, such, as, the, superman, of, dr, jukes, it, is, unclear, whether, siegel, and, shuster, were, influenced, by, friedrich, nietzsche, s, concept, of, the, bermensch, they, never, acknowledged, as, much, since, 1938, superman, stories, have, been, regularly, published, in, periodical, comic, books, published, by, dc, comics, the, first, and, oldest, of, these, is, action, comics, which, began, in, april, 1938, action, comics, was, initially, an, anthology, magazine, but, it, eventually, became, dedicated, to, superman, stories, the, second, oldest, periodical, is, superman, which, began, in, june, 1939, action, comics, and, superman, have, been, published, without, interruption, ignoring, changes, to, the, title, and, numbering, scheme, a, number, of, other, shorter, lived, superman, periodicals, have, been, published, over, the, years, superman, is, part, of, the, dc, universe, which, is, a, shared, setting, of, superhero, characters, owned, by, dc, comics, and, consequently, he, frequently, appears, in, stories, alongside, the, likes, of, batman, wonder, woman, and, others, superman, has, sold, more, comic, books, over, his, publication, history, than, any, other, american, superhero, character, exact, sales, figures, for, the, early, decades, of, superman, comic, books, are, hard, to, find, because, like, most, publishers, at, the, time, dc, comics, concealed, this, data, from, its, competitors, and, thereby, the, general, public, as, well, but, given, the, general, market, trends, at, the, time, sales, of, action, comics, and, superman, probably, peaked, in, the, mid, 1940s, and, thereafter, steadily, declined, sales, data, first, became, public, in, 1960, and, showed, that, superman, was, the, best, selling, comic, book, character, of, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, sales, rose, again, starting, in, 1987, superman, 75, nov, 1992, sold, over, 23, million, copies, making, it, the, best, selling, issue, of, a, comic, book, of, all, time, thanks, to, a, media, sensation, over, the, supposedly, permanent, death, of, the, character, in, that, issue, sales, declined, from, that, point, on, in, march, 2018, action, comics, sold, just, 51, 534, copies, although, such, low, figures, are, normal, for, superhero, comic, books, in, general, for, comparison, amazing, spider, man, 797, sold, only, 128, 189, copies, the, comic, books, are, today, considered, a, niche, aspect, of, the, superman, franchise, due, to, low, readership, though, they, remain, influential, as, creative, engines, for, the, movies, and, television, shows, comic, book, stories, can, be, produced, quickly, and, cheaply, and, are, thus, an, ideal, medium, for, experimentation, whereas, comic, books, in, the, 1950s, were, read, by, children, since, the, 1990s, the, average, reader, has, been, an, adult, a, major, reason, for, this, shift, was, dc, comics, decision, in, the, 1970s, to, sell, its, comic, books, to, specialty, stores, instead, of, traditional, magazine, retailers, supermarkets, newsstands, etc, a, model, called, direct, distribution, this, made, comic, books, less, accessible, to, children, beginning, in, january, 1939, a, superman, daily, comic, strip, appeared, in, newspapers, syndicated, through, the, mcclure, syndicate, a, color, sunday, version, was, added, that, november, jerry, siegel, wrote, most, of, the, strips, until, he, was, conscripted, in, 1943, the, sunday, strips, had, a, narrative, continuity, separate, from, the, daily, strips, possibly, because, siegel, had, to, delegate, the, sunday, strips, to, ghostwriters, by, 1941, the, newspaper, strips, had, an, estimated, readership, of, 20, million, joe, shuster, drew, the, early, strips, then, passed, the, job, to, wayne, boring, from, 1949, to, 1956, the, newspaper, strips, were, drawn, by, win, mortimer, the, strip, ended, in, may, 1966, but, was, revived, from, 1977, to, 1983, to, coincide, with, a, series, of, movies, released, by, warner, bros, initially, siegel, was, allowed, to, write, superman, more, or, less, as, he, saw, fit, because, nobody, had, anticipated, the, success, and, rapid, expansion, of, the, franchise, but, soon, siegel, and, shuster, s, work, was, put, under, careful, oversight, for, fear, of, trouble, with, censors, siegel, was, forced, to, tone, down, the, violence, and, social, crusading, that, characterized, his, early, stories, editor, whitney, ellsworth, hired, in, 1940, dictated, that, superman, not, kill, sexuality, was, banned, and, colorfully, outlandish, villains, such, as, ultra, humanite, and, toyman, were, thought, to, be, less, nightmarish, for, young, readers, mort, weisinger, was, the, editor, on, superman, comics, from, 1941, to, 1970, his, tenure, briefly, interrupted, by, military, service, siegel, and, his, fellow, writers, had, developed, the, character, with, little, thought, of, building, a, coherent, mythology, but, as, the, number, of, superman, titles, and, the, pool, of, writers, grew, weisinger, demanded, a, more, disciplined, approach, weisinger, assigned, story, ideas, and, the, logic, of, superman, s, powers, his, origin, the, locales, and, his, relationships, with, his, growing, cast, of, supporting, characters, were, carefully, planned, elements, such, as, bizarro, his, cousin, supergirl, the, phantom, zone, the, fortress, of, solitude, alternate, varieties, of, kryptonite, robot, doppelgangers, and, krypto, were, introduced, during, this, era, the, complicated, universe, built, under, weisinger, was, beguiling, to, devoted, readers, but, alienating, to, casuals, weisinger, favored, lighthearted, stories, over, serious, drama, and, avoided, sensitive, subjects, such, as, the, vietnam, war, and, the, american, civil, rights, movement, because, he, feared, his, right, wing, views, would, alienate, his, left, leaning, writers, and, readers, weisinger, also, introduced, letters, columns, in, 1958, to, encourage, feedback, and, build, intimacy, with, readers, weisinger, retired, in, 1970, and, julius, schwartz, took, over, by, his, own, admission, weisinger, had, grown, out, of, touch, with, newer, readers, starting, with, the, sandman, saga, schwartz, updated, superman, by, making, clark, kent, a, television, anchor, and, he, retired, overused, plot, elements, such, as, kryptonite, and, robot, doppelgangers, schwartz, also, scaled, superman, s, powers, down, to, a, level, closer, to, siegel, s, original, these, changes, would, eventually, be, reversed, by, later, writers, schwartz, allowed, stories, with, serious, drama, such, as, for, the, man, who, has, everything, superman, annual, 11, in, which, the, villain, mongul, torments, superman, with, an, illusion, of, happy, family, life, on, a, living, krypton, schwartz, retired, from, dc, comics, in, 1986, and, was, succeeded, by, mike, carlin, as, an, editor, on, superman, comics, his, retirement, coincided, with, dc, comics, decision, to, reboot, the, dc, universe, with, the, companywide, crossover, storyline, crisis, on, infinite, earths, in, the, man, of, steel, writer, john, byrne, rewrote, the, superman, mythos, again, reducing, superman, s, powers, which, writers, had, slowly, re, strengthened, and, revised, many, supporting, characters, such, as, making, lex, luthor, a, billionaire, industrialist, rather, than, a, mad, scientist, and, making, supergirl, an, artificial, shapeshifting, organism, because, dc, wanted, superman, to, be, the, sole, surviving, kryptonian, carlin, was, promoted, to, executive, editor, for, the, dc, universe, books, in, 1996, a, position, he, held, until, 2002, k, c, carlson, took, his, place, as, editor, of, the, superman, comics, in, the, earlier, decades, of, superman, comics, artists, were, expected, to, conform, to, a, certain, house, style, joe, shuster, defined, the, aesthetic, style, of, superman, in, the, 1940s, after, shuster, left, national, wayne, boring, succeeded, him, as, the, principal, artist, on, superman, comic, books, he, redrew, superman, taller, and, more, detailed, around, 1955,

was, an, attempt, to, modernize, the, character, however, for, the, 1978, movie, the, producers, chose, to, make, clark, a, newspaper, journalist, again, because, that, was, how, most, people,

with, his, adoptive, earth, parents, everything, about, clark, was, staged, for, the, benefit, of, his, alternate, identity, as, a, reporter, for, the, daily, planet, he, receives, late, breaking, news, before, the, general, public, always, has, a, plausible, reason, to, be, present, at, crime, scenes, and, need, not, strictly, account, for, his, whereabouts, as, long, as, he, makes, his, publication, deadlines, he, sees, his, job, as, a, journalist, as, an, extension, of, his, superman, responsibilities, bringing, truth, to, the, forefront, and, fighting, for, the, little, guy, he,

series, that, appeared, primarily, in, the, superman, family, the, private, life, of, clark, kent, where, superman, dealt, with, various, situations, subtly, while, remaining, clark, to, deflect, suspicion, that, he, is, superman, clark, kent, adopted, a, mainly, passive, and, introverted, personality, with, conservative, mannerisms, a, higher, pitched, voice, and, a, slight, slouch, this, personality, is, typically, described, as, mild, mannered, as, in, the, opening, narration, of, max, fleischer, s, superman, animated, theatrical, shorts, these, traits, extended, into, clark, s, wardrobe, which, typically, consists, of, a, bland, colored, business, suit, a, red, necktie, black, rimmed, glasses, combed, back, hair, and, occasionally, a, fedora, clark, wears, his, superman, costume, underneath, his, street, clothes, allowing, easy, changes, between, the, two, personae, and, the, dramatic, gesture, of, ripping, open, his, shirt, to, reveal, the, familiar, s, emblem, when,

clothing, compressed, in, a, secret, pouch, within, his, cape, though, some, stories, have, shown, him, leaving, his, clothes, in, some, covert, location, such, as, the, daily, planet, storeroom, for, later, retrieval, as, superman, s, alter, ego, the, personality, concept, and, name, of, clark, kent, have, become, synonymous, with, secret, identities, and, innocuous, fronts, for, ulterior, motives, and, activities, in, 1992, superman, co, creator, joe, shuster, told, the, toronto, star, that, the, name, derived, from, 1930s, cinematic, leading, men, clark, gable, and, kent, taylor, but, the, persona, from, bespectacled, silent, film, comic, harold, lloyd, and, himself, clark, s, middle, name, is, given, variously, as, either, joseph, jerome, or, jonathan, all, being, allusions, to, creators, jerry, siegel, and, joe, shuster, in, the, original, siegel, and, shuster, stories, superman, s, personality, is, rough, and, aggressive, he, often, uses, excessive, force, and, terror, against, criminals, on, some, occasions, even, killing, them, this, came, to, an, end, in, late, 1940, when, new, editor, whitney, ellsworth, instituted, a, code, of, conduct, for, his, characters, to, follow, banning, superman, from, ever, killing, the, character, was, softened, and, given, a, sense, of, humanitarianism, ellsworth, s, code, however, is, not, to, be, confused, with, the, comics, code, which, was, created, in, 1954, by, the, comics, code, authority, and, ultimately, abandoned, by, every, major, comic, book, publisher, by, the, early, 21st, century, in, his, first, appearances, superman, was, considered, a, vigilante, by, the, authorities, being, fired, upon, by, the, national, guard, as, he, razed, a, slum, so, that, the, government, would, create, better, housing, conditions, for, the, poor, by, 1942, however, superman, was, working, side, by, side, with, the, police, today, superman, is, commonly, seen, as, a, brave, and, kind, hearted, hero, with, a, strong, sense, of, justice, morality, and, righteousness, he, adheres, to, an, unwavering, moral, code, instilled, in, him, by, his, adoptive, parents, his, commitment, to, operating, within, the, law, has, been, an, example, to, many, citizens, and, other, heroes, but, has, stirred, resentment, and, criticism, among, others, who, refer, to, him, as, the, big, blue, boy, scout, superman, can, be, rather, rigid, in, this, trait, causing, tensions, in, the, superhero, community, this, was, most, notable, with, wonder, woman, one, of, his, closest, friends, after, she, killed, maxwell, lord, booster, gold, initially, had, an, icy, relationship, with, the, man, of, steel, but, grew, to, respect, him, having, lost, his, home, world, of, krypton, superman, is, very, protective, of, earth, and, especially, of, clark, kent, s, family, and, friends, this, same, loss, combined, with, the, pressure, of, using, his, powers, responsibly, has, caused, superman, to, feel, lonely, on, earth, despite, having, his, friends, and, parents, previous, encounters, with, people, he, thought, to, be, fellow, kryptonians, power, girl, and, mon, el, have, led, to, disappointment, the, arrival, of, supergirl, who, has, been, confirmed, to, be, his, cousin, from, krypton, relieved, this, loneliness, somewhat, superman, s, fortress, of, solitude, acts, as, a, place, of, solace, for, him, in, times, of, loneliness, and, despair, the, catalog, of, superman, s, abilities, and, his, strength, has, varied, considerably, over, the, vast, body, of, superman, fiction, released, since, 1938, since, action,

not, even, a, nuclear, bomb, can, harm, him, in, the, earliest, stories, superman, s, costume, is, made, out, of, exotic, materials, that, are, as, tough, as, he, is, which, is, why, it, typically, does, not, tear, up, when, he, performs, superhuman, feats, in, later, stories, beginning, with, man, of, steel, 1, 1986, superman, s, body, is, said, to, project, an, aura, that, renders, invulnerable, any, tight, fitting, clothes, he, wears, and, hence, his, costume, is, as, durable, as, he, is, even, if, made, of, common, cloth, in, action, comics, 1, superman, could, not, fly, he, traveled, by, running, and, leaping, which, he, could, do, to, a, prodigious, degree, thanks, to, his, strength, superman, gained, the, ability, to, fly, in, the, second, episode, of, the, radio,

noting, that, he, can, be, seen, as, the, representative, of, all, his, similars, writing, in, time, in, 1971, gerald, clarke, stated, superman, s, enormous, popularity, might, be, looked, upon, as, signaling, the, beginning, of, the, end, for, the, horatio, alger, myth, of, the, self, made, man, clarke, viewed, the, comics, characters, as, having, to, continuously, update, in, order, to, maintain, relevance, and, thus, representing, the, mood, of, the, nation, he, regarded, superman, s, character, in, the, early, seventies, as, a, comment, on, the, modern, world, which, he, saw, as, a, place, in, which, only, the, man, with, superpowers, can, survive, and, prosper, andrew, arnold, writing, in, the, early, 21st, century, has, noted, superman, s, partial, role, in, exploring, assimilation, the, character, s, alien, status, allowing, the, reader, to, explore, attempts, to, fit, in, on, a, somewhat, superficial, level, a, c, grayling, writing, in, the, spectator, traces, superman, s, stances, through, the, decades, from, his, 1930s, campaign, against, crime, being, relevant, to, a, nation, under, the, influence, of, al, capone, through, the, 1940s, and, world, war, ii, a, period, in, which, superman, helped, sell, war, bonds, and, into, the, 1950s, where, superman, explored, the, new, technological, threats, grayling, notes, the, period, after, the, cold, war, as, being, one, where, matters, become, merely, personal, the, task, of, pitting, his, brawn, against, the, brains, of, lex, luthor, and, brainiac, appeared, to, be, independent, of, bigger, questions, and, discusses, events, post, 9, 11, stating, that, as, a, nation, caught, between, the, terrifying, george, w, bush, and, the, terrorist, osama, bin, laden, america, is, in, earnest, need, of, a, saviour, for, everything, from, the, minor, inconveniences, to, the, major, horrors, of, world, catastrophe, and, here, he, is, the, down, home, clean, cut, boy, in, the, blue, tights, and, red, cape, an, influence, on, early, superman, stories, is, the, context, of, the, great, depression, superman, took, on, the, role, of, social, activist, fighting, crooked, businessmen, and, politicians, and, demolishing, run, down, tenements, comics, scholar, roger, sabin, sees, this, as, a, reflection, of, the, liberal, idealism, of, franklin, roosevelt, s, new, deal, with, shuster, and, siegel, initially, portraying, superman, as, champion, to, a, variety, of, social, causes, in, later, superman, radio, programs, the, character, continued, to, take, on, such, issues, tackling, a, version, of, the, ku, klux, klan, in, a, 1946, broadcast, as, well, as, combating, anti, semitism, and, veteran, discrimination, scott, bukatman, has, discussed, superman, and, the, superhero, in, general, noting, the, ways, in, which, they, humanize, large, urban, areas, through, their, use, of, the, space, especially, in, superman, s, ability, to, soar, over, the, large, skyscrapers, of, metropolis, he, writes, that, the, character, represented, in, 1938, a, kind, of, corbusierian, ideal, superman, has, x, ray, vision, walls, become, permeable, transparent, through, his, benign, controlled, authority, superman, renders, the, city, open, modernist, and, democratic, he, furthers, a, sense, that, le, corbusier, described, in, 1925, namely, that, everything, is, known, to, us, jules, feiffer, has, argued, that, superman, s, real, innovation, lay, in, the, creation, of, the, clark, kent, persona, noting, that, what, made, superman, extraordinary, was, his, point, of, origin, clark, kent, feiffer, develops, the, theme, to, establish, superman, s, popularity, in, simple, wish, fulfillment, a, point, siegel, and, shuster, themselves, supported, siegel, commenting, that, if, you, re, interested, in, what, made, superman, what, it, is, here, s, one, of, the, keys, to, what, made, it, universally, acceptable, joe, and, i, had, certain, inhibitions, which, led, to, wish, fulfillment, which, we, expressed, through, our, interest, in, science, fiction, and, our, comic, strip, that, s, where, the, dual, identity, concept, came, from, and, shuster, supporting, that, as, being, why, so, many, people, could, relate, to, it, ian, gordon, suggests, that, the, many, incarnations, of, superman, across, media, use, nostalgia, to, link, the, character, to, an, ideology, of, the, american, way, he, defines, this, ideology, as, a, means, of, associating, individualism, consumerism, and, democracy, and, as, something, that, took, shape, around, wwii, and, underpinned, the, war, effort, superman, he, notes, was, very, much, part, of, that, effort, superman, s, immigrant, status, is, a, key, aspect, of, his, appeal, aldo, regalado, saw, the, character, as, pushing, the, boundaries, of, acceptance, in, america, the, extraterrestrial, origin, was, seen, by, regalado, as, challenging, the, notion, that, anglo, saxon, ancestry, was, the, source, of, all, might, gary, engle, saw, the, myth, of, superman, with, total, confidence, and, a, childlike, innocence, the, value, of, the, immigrant, in, american, culture, he, argues, that, superman, allowed, the, superhero, genre, to, take, over, from, the, western, as, the, expression, of, immigrant, sensibilities, through, the, use, of, a, dual, identity, superman, allowed, immigrants, to, identify, with, both, of, their, cultures, clark, kent, represents, the, assimilated, individual, allowing, superman, to, express, the, immigrants, cultural, heritage, for, the, greater, good, david, jenemann, has, offered, a, contrasting, view, he, argues, that, superman, s, early, stories, portray, a, threat, the, possibility, that, the, exile, would, overwhelm, the, country, david, rooney, a, theater, critic, for, the, new, york, times, in, his, evaluation, of, the, play, year, zero, considers, superman, to, be, the, quintessential, immigrant, story, orn, on, an, alien, planet, he, grows, stronger, on, earth, but, maintains, a, secret, identity, tied, to, a, homeland, that, continues, to, exert, a, powerful, hold, on, him, even, as, his, every, contact, with, those, origins, does, him, harm, it, is, popularly, believed, that, superman, took, inspiration, from, judaic, mythology, the, british, rabbi, simcha, weinstein, notes, that, superman, s, story, has, some, parallels, to, that, of, moses, for, example, moses, as, a, baby, was, sent, away, by, his, parents, in, a, reed, basket, to, escape, death, and, was, adopted, by, a, foreign, culture, weinstein, also, posits, that, superman, s, kryptonian, name, kal, el, resembles, the, hebrew, phrase, q, l, l, which, can, be, taken, to, mean, voice, of, god, the, historian, larry, tye, suggests, that, this, voice, of, god, is, an, allusion, to, moses, role, as, a, prophet, the, suffix, el, meaning, god, is, also, found, in, the, name, of, angels, e, g, gabriel, ariel, who, are, airborne, humanoid, agents, of, good, with, superhuman, powers, the, nazis, also, thought, superman, was, a, jew, and, in, 1940, joseph, goebbels, publicly, denounced, superman, and, his, creator, jerry, siegel, all, that, said, historians, such, as, martin, lund, and, les, daniels, argue, that, the, evidence, for, judaic, influence, in, siegel, and, shuster, s, stories, is, merely, circumstantial, jerry, siegel, and, joe, shuster, were, not, practicing, jews, and, never, acknowledged, the, influence, of, judaism, in, any, memoir, or, interview, superman, stories, have, occasionally, exhibited, christian, themes, as, well, screenwriter, tom, mankiewicz, consciously, made, superman, an, allegory, for, jesus, christ, in, the, 1978, movie, starring, christopher, reeve, baby, kal, el, s, ship, resembles, the, star, of, bethlehem, and, jor, el, gives, his, son, a, messianic, mission, to, lead, humanity, into, a, brighter, future, this, messianic, theme, was, revisited, in, the, 2013, movie, man, of, steel, wherein, jor, el, asks, superman, to, redeem, the, kryptonian, race, which, corrupted, itself, through, eugenics, by, guiding, humanity, down, a, wiser, path
