variety, of, art, forms, including, painting, sculpture, pottery, and, textile, arts, such, as, woven, silk, geographically, it, spans, the, entire, indian, subcontinent, including, what, is, now, india, pakistan, bangladesh, sri, lanka, nepal, bhutan, and, at, times, eastern, afghanistan, a, strong, sense, of, design, is, characteristic, of, indian, art, and, can, be, observed, in, its, modern, and, traditional, forms, the, origin, of, indian, art, can, be, traced, to, prehistoric, settlements, in, the, 3rd, millennium, bce, on, its, way, to, modern, times, indian, art, has, had, cultural, influences, as, well, as, religious, influences, such, as, hinduism, buddhism, jainism, sikhism, and, islam, in, spite, of, this, complex, mixture, of, religious, traditions, generally, the, prevailing, artistic, style, at, any, time, and, place, has, been, shared, by, the, major, religious, groups, in, historic, art, sculpture, in, stone, and, metal, mainly, religious, has, survived, the, indian, climate, better, than, other, media, and, provides, most, of, the, best, remains, many, of, the, most, important, ancient, finds, that, are, not, in, carved, stone, come, from, the, surrounding, drier, regions, rather, than, india, itself, indian, funeral, and, philosophic, traditions, exclude, grave, goods, which, is, the, main, source, of, ancient, art, in, other, cultures, indian, artist, styles, historically, followed, indian, religions, out, of, the, subcontinent, having, an, especially, large, influence, in, tibet, south, east, asia, and, china, indian, art, has, itself, received, influences, at, times, especially, from, central, asia, and, iran, and, europe, rock, art, of, india, includes, rock, relief, carvings, engravings, and, paintings, some, but, by, no, means, all, from, the, south, asian, stone, age, it, is, estimated, there, are, about, 1300, rock, art, sites, with, over, a, quarter, of, a, million, figures, and, figurines, the, earliest, rock, carvings, in, india, were, discovered, by, archibald, carlleyle, twelve, years, before, the, cave, of, altamira, in, spain, although, his, work, only, came, to, light, much, later, via, j, cockburn, 1899, dr, v, s, wakankar, discovered, several, painted, rock, shelters, in, central, india, situated, around, the, vindhya, mountain, range, of, these, the, c, 750, sites, making, up, the, bhimbetka, rock, shelters, have, been, enrolled, as, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, the, earliest, paintings, are, some, 10, 000, years, old, the, paintings, in, these, sites, commonly, depicted, scenes, of, human, life, alongside, animals, and, hunts, with, stone, implements, their, style, varied, with, region, and, age, but, the, most, common, characteristic, was, a, red, wash, made, using, a, powdered, mineral, called, geru, which, is, a, form, of, iron, oxide, hematite, despite, its, wide, spread, and, sophistication, the, indus, valley, civilisation, seems, to, have, taken, no, interest, in, public, large, scale, art, unlike, many, other, early, civilizations, a, number, of, gold, terracotta, and, stone, figurines, of, girls, in, dancing, poses, reveal, the, presence, of, some, forms, of, dance, additionally, the, terracotta, figurines, included, cows, bears, monkeys, and, dogs, by, far, the, most, common, form, of, figurative, art, found, is, small, carved, seals, thousands, of, steatite, seals, have, been, recovered, and, their, physical, character, is, fairly, consistent, in, size, they, range, from, 3, 4, inch, to, 1, 1, 2, inches, square, in, most, cases, they, have, a, pierced, boss, at, the, back, to, accommodate, a, cord, for, handling, or, for, use, as, personal, adornment, seals, have, been, found, at, mohenjo, daro, depicting, a, figure, standing, on, its, head, and, another, on, the, pashupati, seal, sitting, cross, legged, in, a, yoga, like, pose, this, figure, has, been, variously, identified, sir, john, marshall, identified, a, resemblance, to, the, hindu, god, shiva, the, animal, depicted, on, a, majority, of, seals, at, sites, of, the, mature, period, has, not, been, clearly, identified, part, bull, part, zebra, with, a, majestic, horn, it, has, been, a, source, of, speculation, as, yet, there, is, insufficient, evidence, to, substantiate, claims, that, the, image, had, religious, or, cultist, significance, but, the, prevalence, of, the, image, raises, the, question, of, whether, or, not, the, animals, in, images, of, the, ivc, are, religious, symbols, the, most, famous, piece, is, the, bronze, dancing, girl, of, mohenjo, daro, which, shows, remarkably, advanced, modelling, of, the, human, figure, for, this, early, date, after, the, end, of, the, indus, valley, civilization, there, is, a, surprising, absence, of, art, of, any, great, degree, of, sophistication, until, the, buddhist, era, it, is, thought, that, this, partly, reflects, the, use, of, perishable, organic, materials, such, as, wood, the, millennium, following, the, collapse, of, the, indus, valley, civilisation, coinciding, with, the, indo, aryan, migration, during, the, vedic, period, is, devoid, of, anthropomorphical, depictions, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, early, vedic, religion, focused, exclusively, on, the, worship, of, purely, elementary, forces, of, nature, by, means, of, elaborate, sacrifices, which, did, not, lend, themselves, easily, to, anthropomorphological, representations, various, artefacts, may, belong, to, the, copper, hoard, culture, 2nd, millennium, bce, some, of, them, suggesting, anthropomorphological, characteristics, interpretations, vary, as, to, the, exact, signification, of, these, artifacts, or, even, the, culture, and, the, periodization, to, which, they, belonged, some, examples, of, artistic, expression, also, appear, in, abstract, pottery, designs, during, the, black, and, red, ware, culture, 1450, 1200, bce, or, the, painted, grey, ware, culture, 1200, 600, bce, with, finds, in, a, wide, area, including, the, area, of, mathura, after, a, gap, of, about, a, thousand, years, most, of, the, early, finds, correspond, to, what, is, called, the, second, period, of, urbanization, in, the, middle, of, the, 1st, millennium, bce, the, anthropomorphic, depiction, of, various, deities, apparently, started, in, the, middle, of, the, 1st, millennium, bce, possibly, as, a, consequence, of, the, influx, of, foreign, stimuli, initiated, with, the, achaemenid, conquest, of, the, indus, valley, and, the, rise, of, alternative, local, faiths, challenging, vedism, such, as, buddhism, jainism, and, local, popular, cults, the, north, indian, maurya, empire, flourished, from, 322, bce, to, 185, bce, and, at, its, maximum, extent, controlled, all, of, the, sub, continent, except, the, extreme, south, as, well, as, influences, from, indian, ancient, traditions, and, ancient, persia, as, shown, by, the, pataliputra, capital, the, emperor, ashoka, who, died, in, 232, bce, adopted, buddhism, about, half, way, through, his, 40, year, reign, and, patronized, several, large, stupas, at, key, sites, from, the, life, of, the, buddha, although, very, little, decoration, from, the, mauryan, period, survives, and, there, may, not, have, been, much, in, the, first, place, there, is, more, from, various, early, sites, of, indian, rock, cut, architecture, the, most, famous, survivals, are, the, large, animals, surmounting, several, of, the, pillars, of, ashoka, which, showed, a, confident, and, boldly, mature, style, and, craft, and, first, of, its, kind, iron, casting, without, rust, until, date, which, was, in, use, by, vedic, people, in, rural, areas, of, the, country, though, we, have, very, few, remains, showing, its, development, the, famous, detached, lion, capital, of, ashoka, with, four, animals, was, adopted, as, the, official, emblem, of, india, after, indian, independence, mauryan, sculpture, and, architecture, is, characterized, by, a, very, fine, mauryan, polish, given, to, the, stone, which, is, rarely, found, in, later, periods, many, small, popular, terracotta, figurines, are, recovered, in, archaeology, in, a, range, of, often, vigorous, if, somewhat, crude, styles, both, animals, and, human, figures, usually, females, presumed, to, be, deities, are, found, yakshas, seem, to, have, been, the, object, of, an, important, cult, in, the, early, periods, of, indian, history, many, of, them, being, known, such, as, kubera, king, of, the, yakshas, manibhadra, or, mudgarpani, the, yakshas, are, a, broad, class, of, nature, spirits, usually, benevolent, but, sometimes, mischievous, or, capricious, connected, with, water, fertility, trees, the, forest, treasure, and, wilderness, and, were, the, object, of, popular, worship, many, of, them, were, later, incorporated, into, buddhism, jainism, or, hinduism, in, the, 2nd, century, bce, yakshas, became, the, focus, of, the, creation, of, colossal, cultic, images, typically, around, 2, meters, or, more, in, height, which, are, considered, as, probably, the, first, indian, anthropomorphic, productions, in, stone, although, few, ancient, yaksha, statues, remain, in, good, condition, the, vigor, of, the, style, has, been, applauded, and, expresses, essentially, indian, qualities, they, are, often, pot, bellied, two, armed, and, fierce, looking, the, yakshas, are, often, depicted, with, weapons, or, attributes, such, as, the, yaksha, mudgarpani, who, in, the, right, hand, holds, a, mudgar, mace, and, in, the, left, hand, the, figure, of, a, small, standing, devotee, or, child, joining, hands, in, prayer, it, is, often, suggested, that, the, style, of, the, colossal, yaksha, statuary, had, an, important, influence, on, the, creation, of, later, divine, images, and, human, figures, in, india, the, female, equivalent, of, the, yakshas, were, the, yakshinis, often, associated, with, trees, and, children, and, whose, voluptuous, figures, became, omnipresent, in, indian, art, some, hellenistic, influence, such, as, the, geometrical, folds, of, the, drapery, or, the, walking, stance, of, the, statues, has, been, suggested, according, to, john, boardman, the, hem, of, the, dress, in, the, monumental, early, yaksha, statues, is, derived, from, greek, art, describing, the, drapery, of, one, of, these, statues, john, boardman, writes, it, has, no, local, antecedents, and, looks, most, like, a, greek, late, archaic, mannerism, and, suggests, it, is, possibly, derived, from, the, hellenistic, art, of, nearby, bactria, where, this, design, is, known, in, the, production, of, colossal, yaksha, statues, carved, in, the, round, which, can, be, found, in, several, locations, in, northern, india, the, art, of, mathura, is, considered, as, the, most, advanced, in, quality, and, quantity, during, this, period, the, major, survivals, of, buddhist, art, begin, in, the, period, after, the, mauryans, from, which, good, quantities, of, sculpture, survives, some, key, sites, are, sanchi, bharhut, and, amaravati, some, of, which, remain, in, situ, with, others, in, museums, in, india, or, around, the, world, stupas, were, surrounded, by, ceremonial, fences, with, four, profusely, carved, toranas, or, ornamental, gateways, facing, the, cardinal, directions, these, are, in, stone, though, clearly, adopting, forms, developed, in, wood, they, and, the, walls, of, the, stupa, itself, can, be, heavily, decorated, with, reliefs, mostly, illustrating, the, lives, of, the, buddha, gradually, life, size, figures, were, sculpted, initially, in, deep, relief, but, then, free, standing, mathura, was, the, most, important, centre, in, this, development, which, applied, to, hindu, and, jain, art, as, well, as, buddhist, the, facades, and, interiors, of, rock, cut, chaitya, prayer, halls, and, monastic, viharas, have, survived, better, than, similar, free, standing, structures, elsewhere, which, were, for, long, mostly, in, wood, the, caves, at, ajanta, karle, bhaja, and, elsewhere, contain, early, sculpture, often, outnumbered, by, later, works, such, as, iconic, figures, of, the, buddha, and, bodhisattvas, which, are, not, found, before, 100, ce, at, the, least, buddhism, developed, an, increasing, emphasis, on, statues, of, the, buddha, which, was, greatly, influenced, by, hindu, and, jain, religious, figurative, art, the, figures, of, this, period, which, were, also, influenced, by, the, greco, buddhist, art, of, the, centuries, after, the, conquests, of, alexander, the, great, this, fusion, developed, in, the, far, north, west, of, india, especially, gandhara, in, modern, afghanistan, and, pakistan, the, indian, kushan, empire, spread, from, central, asia, to, include, northern, india, in, the, early, centuries, ce, and, briefly, commissioned, large, statues, that, were, portraits, of, the, royal, dynasty, with, the, fall, of, the, maurya, empire, control, of, india, was, returned, to, the, older, custom, of, regional, dynasties, one, of, the, most, significant, of, which, was, the, shunga, dynasty, c, 185, bce, 72, bce, of, central, india, during, this, period, as, well, as, during, the, satavahana, dynasty, which, occurred, concurrently, with, the, shunga, dynasty, in, south, india, some, of, the, most, significant, early, buddhist, architecture, was, created, arguably, the, most, significant, architecture, of, this, dynasty, is, the, stupa, a, religious, monument, which, usually, holds, a, sacred, relic, of, buddhism, these, relics, were, often, but, not, always, in, some, way, directly, connected, to, the, buddha, due, to, the, fact, that, these, stupas, contained, remains, of, the, buddha, himself, each, stupa, was, venerated, as, being, an, extension, of, the, buddha, s, body, his, enlightenment, and, of, his, achievement, of, nirvana, the, way, in, which, buddhists, venerate, the, stupa, is, by, walking, around, it, in, a, clockwise, manner, one, of, the, most, notable, examples, of, the, buddhist, stupa, from, the, shunga, dynasty, is, the, great, stupa, at, sanchi, which, was, thought, to, be, founded, by, the, mauryan, emperor, ashoka, c, 273, bce, 232, bce, during, the, maurya, empire, the, great, stupa, was, enlarged, to, its, present, diameter, of, 120, feet, covered, with, a, stone, casing, topped, with, a, balcony, and, umbrella, and, encircled, with, a, stone, railing, during, the, shunga, dynasty, c, 150, bce, 50, bce, in, addition, to, architecture, another, significant, art, form, of, the, shunga, dynasty, is, the, elaborately, moulded, terracotta, plaques, as, seen, in, previous, examples, from, the, mauryan, empire, a, style, in, which, surface, detail, nudity, and, sensuality, is, continued, in, the, terracotta, plaques, of, the, shunga, dynasty, the, most, common, figural, representations, seen, on, these, plaques, are, women, some, of, which, are, thought, to, be, goddesses, who, are, mostly, shown, as, bare, chested, and, wearing, elaborate, headdresses, the, satavahana, dynasty, ruled, in, central, india, and, sponsored, many, large, buddhist, monuments, stupas, temples, and, prayer, halls, including, the, amaravati, stupa, the, karla, caves, and, the, first, phase, of, the, ajanta, caves, stupas, are, religious, monuments, built, on, burial, mounds, which, contain, relics, beneath, a, solid, dome, stupas, in, different, areas, of, india, may, vary, in, structure, size, and, design, however, their, representational, meanings, are, quite, similar, they, are, designed, based, on, a, mandala, a, graph, of, cosmos, specific, to, buddhism, a, traditional, stupa, has, a, railing, that, provides, a, sacred, path, for, buddhist, followers, to, practice, devotional, circumambulation, in, ritual, settings, also, ancient, indians, considered, caves, as, sacred, places, since, they, were, inhabited, by, holy, men, and, monks, a, chaitya, was, constructed, from, a, cave, relief, sculptures, of, buddhist, figures, and, epigraphs, written, in, brahmi, characters, are, often, found, in, divine, places, specific, to, buddhism, to, celebrate, the, divine, satavahana, people, also, made, stone, images, as, the, decoration, in, buddhist, architectures, based, on, the, knowledge, of, geometry, and, geology, they, created, ideal, images, using, a, set, of, complex, techniques, and, tools, such, as, chisels, hammers, and, compasses, with, iron, points, in, addition, delicate, satavahana, coins, show, the, capacity, of, creating, art, in, that, period, the, satavahanas, issued, coins, primarily, in, copper, lead, and, potin, later, on, silver, came, into, use, when, producing, coins, the, coins, usually, have, detailed, portraits, of, rulers, and, inscriptions, written, in, the, language, of, tamil, and, telugu, officially, established, by, kujula, kadphises, the, first, kushan, emperor, who, united, the, yuezhi, tribes, the, kushan, empire, was, a, syncretic, empire, in, central, and, southern, asia, including, the, regions, of, gandhara, and, mathura, in, northern, india, from, 127, to, 151, ce, gandharan, reached, its, peak, under, the, reign, of, kanishka, the, great, in, this, period, kushan, art, inherited, the, greco, buddhist, art, mahayana, buddhism, flourished, and, the, depictions, of, buddha, as, a, human, form, first, appeared, in, art, wearing, a, monk, s, robe, and, a, long, length, of, cloth, draped, over, the, left, shoulder, and, around, the, body, the, buddha, was, depicted, with, 32, major, lakshanas, distinguishing, marks, including, a, golden, colored, body, an, ushnisha, a, protuberance, on, the, top, of, his, head, heavy, earrings, elongated, earlobes, long, arms, the, impression, of, a, chakra, wheel, on, the, palms, of, his, hands, and, the, soles, of, his, feet, and, the, urna, a, mark, between, his, eyebrows, one, of, the, hallmarks, of, gandharan, art, is, its, relation, to, naturalism, of, hellenistic, art, the, naturalistic, features, found, in, gandharan, sculptures, include, the, three, dimensional, treatment, of, the, drapery, with, unregularized, folds, that, are, in, realistic, patterns, of, random, shape, and, thickness, the, physical, form, of, the, buddha, and, his, bodhisattvas, are, well, defined, solid, and, muscular, with, swelling, chests, arms, and, abdomens, buddhism, and, buddhism, art, spread, to, central, asia, and, the, far, east, across, bactria, and, sogdia, where, the, kushan, empire, met, the, han, dynasty, of, china, the, gupta, period, is, generally, regarded, as, a, classic, peak, of, north, indian, art, for, all, the, major, religious, groups, although, painting, was, evidently, widespread, and, survives, in, the, ajanta, caves, the, surviving, works, are, almost, all, religious, sculpture, the, period, saw, the, emergence, of, the, iconic, carved, stone, deity, in, hindu, art, as, well, as, the, buddha, figure, and, jain, tirthankara, figures, these, last, often, on, a, very, large, scale, the, main, centres, of, sculpture, were, mathura, sarnath, and, gandhara, the, last, the, centre, of, greco, buddhist, art, the, gupta, period, marked, the, golden, age, of, classical, hinduism, and, saw, the, earliest, constructed, hindu, temple, architecture, though, survivals, are, not, numerous, over, this, period, hindu, temple, architecture, matured, into, a, number, of, regional, styles, and, a, large, proportion, of, the, art, historical, record, for, this, period, consists, of, temple, sculpture, much, of, which, remains, in, place, the, political, history, of, the, middle, kingdoms, of, india, saw, india, divided, into, many, states, and, since, much, of, the, grandest, building, was, commissioned, by, rulers, and, their, court, this, helped, the, development, of, regional, differences, painting, both, on, a, large, scale, on, walls, and, in, miniature, forms, was, no, doubt, very, widely, practiced, but, survivals, are, rare, medieval, bronzes, have, most, commonly, survived, from, either, the, tamil, south, or, the, himalayan, foothills, inscriptions, on, the, pillars, of, ashoka, mention, coexistence, of, the, northern, kingdoms,

developed, as, a, distinct, school, of, indian, painting, from, the, depiction, of, hindu, gods, other, mythological, characters, the, kalighat, paintings, developed, to, reflect, a, variety, of, themes, although, islamic, conquests, in, india, were, made, as, early, as, the, first, half, of, the, 10th, century, it, wasn, t, until, the, mughal, empire, that, one, observes, emperors, with, a, patronage, for, the, fine, arts, emperor, humayun, during, his, reestablishment, of, the, delhi, sultanate, in, 1555, brought, with, him, mir, sayyid, ali, and, abd, al, samad, two, of, the, finest, painters, from, persian, shah, tahmasp, s, renowned, atelier, during, the, reign, of, akbar, 1556, 1605, the, number, of, painters, grew, from, around, 30, during, the, creation, of, the, hamzanama, in, the, mid, 1560s, to, around, 130, by, the, mid, 1590s, according, to, court, historian, abu, l, fazal, akbar, was, hands, on, in, his, interest, of, the, arts, inspecting, his, painters, regularly, and, rewarding, the, best, it, is, during, this, time, that, persian, artists, were, attracted, to, bringing, their, unique, style, to, the, empire, indian, elements, were, present, in, their, works, from, the, beginning, with, the, incorporation, of, local, indian, flora, and, fauna, that, were, otherwise, absent, from, the, traditional, persian, style, the, paintings, of, this,

locations, in, india, with, paintings, and, traces, of, former, paintings, of, ancient, and, early, medieval, times, up, to, the, 8th, to, 10th, centuries, ce, although, these, are, just, a, tiny,

varied, media, such, as, pottery, painting, metalwork, paper, art, weaving, and, designing, of, objects, such, as, jewellery, and, toys, these, are, not, just, aesthetic, objects, but, in, fact, have, an, important, significance, in, people, s, lives, and, are, tied, to, their, beliefs, and, rituals, the, objects, can, range, from, sculpture, masks, used, in, rituals, and, ceremonies, paintings, textiles, baskets, kitchen, objects, arms, and, weapons, and, the, human, body, itself, tattoos, and, piercings, there, is, a, deep, symbolic, meaning, that, is, attached, to, not, only, the, objects,

kind, of, civilized, life, they, still, continue, to, practice, their, art, unfortunately, though, market, and, economic, forces, have, ensured, that, the, numbers, of, these, artists, are, dwindling, a, lot, of, effort, is, being, made, by, various, ngos, and, the, government, of, india, to, preserve, and, protect, these, arts, and, to, promote, them, several, scholars, in, india, and, across, the, world, have, studied, these, arts, and, some, valuable, scholarship, is, available, on, them, the, folk, spirit, has, a, tremendous, role, to, play, in, the, development, of, art, and, in, the, overall, consciousness, of, indigenous, cultures, the, year, 1997, bore, witness, to, two, parallel, gestures, of, canon, formation, on, the, one, hand, the, influential, baroda, group, a, coalition, whose, original, members, included, vivan, sundaram, ghulam, mohammed, sheikh, bhupen, khakhar, and, nalini, malani, and, which, had, left, its, mark, on, history, in, the, form, of, the, 1981, exhibition, place, for, people, was, definitively, historicized, in, 1997, with, the, publication, of, contemporary, art, in, baroda, an, anthology, of, essays, edited, by, sheikh, on, the, other, hand, the, art, historian, r, siva, kumar, s, benchmark, exhibition, and, related, publication, a, contextual, modernism, restored, the, santiniketan, artists, rabindranath, tagore, nandalal, bose, benode, behari, mukherjee, and, ramkinkar, baij, to, their, proper, place, as, the, originators, of, an, indigenously, achieved, yet, transcultural, modernism, in, the, 1930s, well, before, the, progressives, composed, their, manifesto, in, the, late, 1940s, of, the, santiniketan, artists, siva, kumar, observed, that, they, reviewed, traditional, antecedents, in, relation, to, the, new, avenues, opened, up, by, cross, cultural, contacts, they, also, saw, it, as, a, historical, imperative, cultural, insularity, they, realized, had, to, give, way, to, eclecticism, and, cultural, impurity, the, idea, of, contextual, modernism, emerged, in, 1997, from, r, siva, kumar, s, santiniketan, the, making, of, a, contextual, modernism, as, a, postcolonial, critical, tool, in, the, understanding, of, an, alternative, modernism, in, the, visual, arts, of, the, erstwhile, colonies, like, india, specifically, that, of, the, santiniketan, artists, several, terms, including, paul, gilroy, s, counter, culture, of, modernity, and, tani, barlow, s, colonial, modernity, have, been, used, to, describe, the, kind, of, alternative, modernity, that, emerged, in, non, european, contexts, professor, gall, argues, that, contextual, modernism, is, a, more, suited, term, because, the, colonial, in, colonial, modernity, does, not, accommodate, the, refusal, of, many, in, colonized, situations, to, internalize, inferiority, santiniketan, s, artist, teachers, refusal, of, subordination, incorporated, a, counter, vision, of, modernity, which, sought, to, correct, the, racial, and, cultural, essentialism, that, drove, and, characterized, imperial, western, modernity, and, modernism, those, european, modernities, projected, through, a, triumphant, british, colonial, power, provoked, nationalist, responses, equally, problematic, when, they, incorporated, similar, essentialisms, according, to, r, siva, kumar, the, santiniketan, artists, were, one, of, the, first, who, consciously, challenged, this, idea, of, modernism, by, opting, out, of, both, internationalist, modernism, and, historicist, indigenousness, and, tried, to, create, a, context, sensitive, modernism, he, had, been, studying, the, work, of, the, santiniketan, masters, and, thinking, about, their, approach, to, art, since, the, early, 80s, the, practice, of, subsuming, nandalal, bose,
