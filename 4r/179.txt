owed, large, sums, of, money, to, creditors, and, was, trying, to, help, the, family, of, his, brother, mikhail, who, had, died, in, early, 1864, after, appeals, elsewhere, failed, dostoevsky, turned, as, a, last, resort, to, the, publisher, mikhail, katkov, and, sought, an, advance, on, a, proposed, contribution, he, offered, his, story, or, novella, at, the, time, he, was, not, thinking, of, a, novel, for, publication, in, katkov, s, monthly, journal, the, russian, messenger, a, prestigious, publication, of, its, kind, and, the, outlet, for, both, ivan, turgenev, and, leo, tolstoy, dostoevsky, having, been, engaged, in, polemical, debates, with, katkov, in, the, early, 1860s, had, never, published, anything, in, its, pages, before, in, a, letter, to, katkov, written, in, september, 1865, dostoevsky, explained, to, him, that, the, work, was, to, be, about, a, young, man, who, yields, to, certain, strange, unfinished, ideas, yet, floating, in, the, air, he, planned, to, explore, the, moral, and, psychological, dangers, of, the, ideology, of, radicalism, and, felt, that, the, project, would, appeal, to, the, conservative, katkov, in, letters, written, in, november, 1865, an, important, conceptual, change, occurred, the, story, had, become, a, novel, from, then, on, crime, and, punishment, is, referred, to, as, a, novel, at, the, end, of, november, much, had, been, written, and, was, ready, i, burned, it, all, i, can, confess, that, now, i, didn, t, like, it, myself, a, new, form, a, new, plan, excited, me, and, i, started, all, over, again, dostoevsky, s, letter, to, his, friend, alexander, wrangel, in, february, 1866, in, the, complete, edition, of, dostoevsky, s, writings, published, in, the, soviet, union, the, editors, reassembled, the, writer, s, notebooks, for, crime, and, punishment, in, a, sequence, roughly, corresponding, to, the, various, stages, of, composition, as, a, result, there, exists, a, fragmentary, working, draft, of, the, novella, as, initially, conceived, as, well, as, two, other, versions, of, the, text, these, have, been, distinguished, as, the, wiesbaden, edition, the, petersburg, edition, and, the, final, plan, involving, the, shift, from, a, first, person, narrator, to, dostoevsky, s, innovative, use, of, third, person, narrative, to, achieve, first, person, narrative, perspectives, dostoevsky, initially, considered, four, first, person, plans, a, memoir, written, by, raskolnikov, his, confession, recorded, eight, days, after, the, murder, his, diary, begun, five, days, after, the, murder, and, a, mixed, form, in, which, the, first, half, was, in, the, form, of, a, memoir, and, the, second, half, in, the, form, of, a, diary, the, wiesbaden, edition, concentrates, entirely, on, the, moral, and, psychological, reactions, of, the, narrator, after, the, murder, it, coincides, roughly, with, the, story, that, dostoevsky, described, in, his, letter, to, katkov, and, written, in, the, form, of, a, diary, or, journal, corresponds, to, what, eventually, became, part, 2, of, the, finished, work, i, wrote, with, genuine, inspiration, but, perhaps, it, is, no, good, but, for, them, the, question, is, not, its, literary, worth, they, are, worried, about, its, morality, here, i, was, in, the, right, nothing, was, against, morality, and, even, quite, the, contrary, but, they, saw, otherwise, and, what, s, more, saw, traces, of, nihilism, i, took, it, back, and, this, revision, of, a, large, chapter, cost, me, at, least, three, new, chapters, of, work, judging, by, the, effort, and, the, weariness, but, i, corrected, it, and, gave, it, back, dostoevsky, s, letter, to, a, p, milyukov, why, dostoevsky, abandoned, his, initial, version, remains, a, matter, of, speculation, according, to, joseph, frank, one, possibility, is, that, his, protagonist, began, to, develop, beyond, the, boundaries, in, which, he, had, first, been, conceived, the, notebooks, indicate, that, dostoevsky, became, aware, of, the, emergence, of, new, aspects, of, raskolnikov, s, character, as, the, plot, developed, and, he, structured, the, novel, in, conformity, with, this, metamorphosis, the, final, version, of, crime, and, punishment, came, into, being, only, when, in, november, 1865, dostoevsky, decided, to, recast, his, novel, in, the, third, person, this, shift, was, the, culmination, of, a, long, struggle, present, through, all, the, early, stages, of, composition, once, having, decided, dostoevsky, began, to, rewrite, from, scratch, and, was, able, to, easily, integrate, sections, of, the, early, manuscript, into, the, final, text, frank, says, that, he, did, not, as, he, told, wrangel, burn, everything, he, had, written, earlier, dostoevsky, was, under, great, pressure, to, finish, crime, and, punishment, on, time, as, he, was, simultaneously, contracted, to, finish, the, gambler, for, the, prominent, russian, publisher, fyodor, stellovsky, who, had, imposed, extremely, harsh, conditions, anna, snitkina, a, stenographer, who, later, became, dostoevsky, s, wife, was, of, great, help, to, him, during, this, difficult, task, the, first, part, of, crime, and, punishment,

who, is, seeking, to, take, advantage, of, dunya, s, situation, raskolnikov, is, enraged, at, his, sister, s, sacrifice, feeling, it, is, the, same, as, what, sonya, felt, compelled, to, do, painfully, aware, of, his, own, poverty, and, impotence, his, thoughts, return, to, his, idea, a, further, series, of, internal, and, external, events, seem, to, conspire, to, compel, him, toward,

openly, mocks, the, young, man, s, unspoken, suspicions, he, returns, to, the, scene, of, the, crime, and, re, lives, the, sensations, he, experienced, at, the, time, he, angers, the, workmen, and,

physically, but, it, becomes, apparent, that, he, is, still, mentally, distracted, and, merely, forcing, himself, to, endure, the, meeting, he, demands, that, dunya, break, with, luzhin, but, dunya, fiercely, defends, her, motives, for, the, marriage, mrs, raskolnikova, has, received, a, note, from, luzhin, demanding, that, her, son, not, be, present, at, any, future, meetings, between, them, he,

raskolnikov, immediately, senses, that, porfiry, knows, that, he, is, the, murderer, porfiry, who, has, just, been, discussing, the, case, with, zamyotov, adopts, an, ironic, tone, during, the, conversation, he, expresses, extreme, curiosity, about, an, article, that, raskolnikov, wrote, some, months, ago, called, on, crime, in, which, he, suggests, that, certain, rare, individuals, the, benefactors, and, geniuses, of, mankind, have, a, right, to, step, across, legal, or, moral, boundaries, if, those, boundaries, are, an, obstruction, to, the, success, of, their, idea, raskolnikov,

him, raskolnikov, tries, to, find, out, what, he, wants, but, the, artisan, says, only, one, word, murderer, and, walks, off, petrified, raskolnikov, returns, to, his, room, and, falls, into, thought, and, then, sleeps, he, wakens, from, an, eerie, nightmare, about, the, murder, of, the, old, woman, to, find, another, complete, stranger, present, this, time, a, man, of, aristocratic, appearance, the, man, politely, introduces, himself, as, arkady, ivanovich, svidrigailov, svidrigailov, indulges, in, an, amiable, but, disjointed, monologue, punctuated, by, raskolnikov, s, terse, interjections, he, claims, to, no, longer, have, any, romantic, interest, in, dunya, but, wants, to, stop, her, from, marrying, luzhin, and, offers, her, ten, thousand, roubles, raskolnikov, refuses, the, money, on, her, behalf, and, refuses, to, facilitate, a, meeting, svidrigailov, also, mentions, that, his, wife, who, defended, dunya, at, the, time, of, the, unpleasantness, but, died, shortly, afterwards, has,

to, the, slander, in, his, letter, luzhin, becomes, reckless, exposing, his, true, character, dunya, tells, him, to, leave, and, never, come, back, now, free, and, with, significant, capital, they, excitedly, begin, to, discuss, plans, for, the, future, but, raskolnikov, suddenly, gets, up, and, leaves, telling, them, to, their, great, consternation, that, it, might, be, the, last, time, he, sees, them, he, instructs, the, baffled, razumikhin, to, remain, and, always, care, for, them, raskolnikov, proceeds, to, sonya, s, place, she, is, gratified, that, he, is, visiting, her, but, also, frightened, of, his, strange, manner, he, asks, a, series, of, merciless, questions, about, her, terrible, situation, and, that, of, katerina, ivanovna, and, the, children, raskolnikov, begins, to, realize, that, sonya, is, sustained, only, by, her, faith, in, god, she, reveals, that, she, was, a, friend, of, the, murdered, lizaveta, in, fact, lizaveta, gave, her, a, cross, and, a, copy, of, the, gospels, she, passionately, reads, to, him, the, story, of, the, raising, of, lazarus, from, the, gospel, of, john, his, fascination, with, her, which, had, begun, at, the, time, when, her, father, spoke, of, her, increases, and, he, decides, that, they, must, face, the, future, together, as, he, leaves, he, tells, her, that, he, will, come, back, tomorrow, and, tell, her, who, killed, her, friend, lizaveta, when, raskolnikov, presents, himself, for, his, interview, porfiry, resumes, and, intensifies, his, insinuating, provocative, ironic, chatter, without, ever, making, a, direct, accusation, with, raskolnikov, s, anger, reaching, fever, pitch, porfiry, hints, that, he, has, a, little, surprise, for, him, behind, the, partition, in, his, office, but, at, that, moment, there, is, a, commotion, outside, the, door, and, a, young, man, mikolka, the, painter, bursts, in, followed, by, some, policemen, to, both, porfiry, and, raskolnikov, s, astonishment, mikolka, proceeds, to, loudly, confess, to, the, murders, porfiry, doesn, t, believe, the, confession, but, he, is, forced, to, let, raskolnikov, go, back, at, his, room, raskolnikov, is, horrified, when, the, old, artisan, suddenly, appears, at, his, door, but, the, man, bows, and, asks, for, forgiveness, he, had, been, porfiry, s, little, surprise, and, had, heard, mikolka, confess, he, had, been, one, of, those, present, when, raskolnikov, returned, to, the, scene, of, the, murders, and, had, reported, his, behavior, to, porfiry, raskolnikov, attends, the, marmeladovs, post, funeral, banquet, at, katerina, ivanovna, s, apartment, the, atmosphere, deteriorates, as, guests, become, drunk, and, the, half, mad, katerina, ivanovna, engages, in, a, verbal, attack, on, her, german, landlady, with, chaos, descending, everyone, is, surprised, by, the, sudden, and, portentous, appearance, of, luzhin, he, sternly, announces, that, a, 100, ruble, banknote, disappeared, from, his, apartment, at, the, precise, time, that, he, was, being, visited, by, sonya, whom, he, had, invited, in, order, to, make, a, small, donation, sonya, fearfully, denies, stealing, the, money, but, luzhin, persists, in, his, accusation, and, demands, that, someone, search, her, outraged, katerina, ivanovna, abuses, luzhin, and, sets, about, emptying, sonya, s, pockets, to, prove, her, innocence, but, a, folded, 100, ruble, note, does, indeed, fly, out, of, one, of, the, pockets, the, mood, in, the, room, turns, against, sonya, luzhin, chastises, her, and, the, landlady, orders, the, family, out, but, luzhin, s, roommate, lebezyatnikov, angrily, asserts, that, he, saw, luzhin, surreptitiously, slip, the, money, into, sonya, s, pocket, as, she, left, although, he, had, thought, at, the, time, that, it, was, a, noble, act, of, anonymous, charity, raskolnikov, backs, lebezyatnikov, up, by, confidently, identifying, luzhin, s, motive, a, desire, to, avenge, himself, on, raskolnikov, by, defaming, sonya, in, hopes, of, causing, a, rift, with, his, family, luzhin, is, discredited, but, sonya, is, traumatized, and, she, runs, out, of, the, apartment, raskolnikov, follows, her, back, at, her, room, raskolnikov, draws, sonya, s, attention, to, the, ease, with, which, luzhin, could, have, ruined, her, and, consequently, the, children, as, well, but, it, is, only, a, prelude, to, his, confession, that, he, is, the, murderer, of, the, old, woman, and, lizaveta, painfully, he, tries, to, explain, his, abstract, motives, for, the, crime, to, uncomprehending, sonya, she, is, horrified, not, just, at, the, crime, but, at, his, own, self, torture, and, tells, him, that, he, must, hand, himself, in, to, the, police, lebezyatnikov, appears, and, tells, them, that, the, landlady, has, kicked, katerina, ivanovna, out, of, the, apartment, and, that, she, has, gone, mad, they, find, katerina, ivanovna, surrounded, by, people, in, the, street, completely, insane, trying, to, force, the, terrified, children, to, perform, for, money, and, near, death, from, her, illness, they, manage, to, get, her, back, to, sonya, s, room, where, distraught, and, raving, she, dies, to, raskolnikov, s, surprise, svidrigailov, suddenly, appears, and, informs, him, that, he, will, be, using, the, ten, thousand, rubles, intended, for, dunya, to, make, the, funeral, arrangements, and, to, place, the, children, in, good, orphanages, when, raskolnikov, asks, him, what, his, motives, are, he, laughingly, replies, with, direct, quotations, of, raskolnikov, s, own, words, spoken, when, he, was, trying, to, explain, his, justifications, for, the, murder, to, sonya, svidrigailov, has, been, residing, next, door, to, sonya, and, overheard, every, word, of, the, murder, confession, razumikhin, tells, raskolnikov, that, dunya, has, become, troubled, and, distant, after, receiving, a, letter, from, someone, he, also, mentions, to, raskolnikov, s, astonishment, that, porfiry, no, longer, suspects, him, of, the, murders, as, raskolnikov, is, about, to, set, off, in, search, of, svidrigailov, porfiry, himself, appears, and, politely, requests, a, brief, chat, he, sincerely, apologises, for, his, previous, behavior, and, seeks, to, explain, the, reasons, behind, it, strangely, raskolnikov, begins, to, feel, alarmed, at, the, thought, that, porfiry, might, think, he, is, innocent, but, porfiry, s, changed, attitude, is, motivated, by, genuine, respect, for, raskolnikov, not, by, any, thought, of, his, innocence, and, he, concludes, by, expressing, his, absolute, certainty, that, raskolnikov, is, indeed, the, murderer, he, claims, that, he, will, be, arresting, him, soon, but, urges, him, to, confess, to, make, it, easier, on, himself, raskolnikov, chooses, to, continue, the, struggle, raskolnikov, finds, svidrigailov, at, an, inn, and, warns, him, against, approaching, dunya, svidrigailov, who, has, in, fact, arranged, to, meet, dunya, threatens, to, go, to, the, police, but, raskolnikov, is, unconcerned, and, follows, when, he, leaves, when, raskolnikov, finally, turns, home, dunya, who, has, been, watching, them, approaches, svidrigailov, and, demands, to, know, what, he, meant, in, his, letter, about, her, brother, s, secret, she, reluctantly, accompanies, him, to, his, rooms, where, he, reveals, what, he, overheard, and, attempts, to, use, it, to, make, her, yield, to, his, desire, dunya, however, has, a, gun, and, she, fires, at, him, narrowly, missing, svidrigailov, gently, encourages, her, to, reload, and, try, again, eventually, she, throws, the, gun, aside, but, svidrigailov, crushed, by, her, hatred, for, him, tells, her, to, leave, later, that, evening, he, goes, to, sonya, to, discuss, the, arrangements, for, katerina, ivanovna, s, children, he, gives, her, 3000, rubles, telling, her, she, will, need, it, if, she, wishes, to, follow, raskolnikov, to, siberia, he, spends, the, night, in, a, miserable, hotel, and, the, following, morning, commits, suicide, in, a, public, place, raskolnikov, says, a, painful, goodbye, to, his, mother, without, telling, her, the, truth, dunya, is, waiting, for, him, at, his, room, and, he, tells, her, that, he, will, be, going, to, the, police, to, confess, to, the, murders, he, stops, at, sonya, s, place, on, the, way, and, she, gives, him, a, crucifix, at, the, bureau, he, learns, of,

a, full, and, frank, confession, to, the, murders, due, to, the, fullness, of, his, confession, at, a, time, when, another, man, had, already, confessed, raskolnikov, is, sentenced, to, only, eight, years, of, penal, servitude, dunya, and, razumikhin, marry, and, plan, to, move, to, siberia, but, raskolnikov, s, mother, falls, ill, and, dies, sonya, follows, raskolnikov, to, siberia, but, he, is, initially, hostile, towards, her, as, he, is, still, struggling, to, acknowledge, moral, culpability, for, his, crime, feeling, himself, to, be, guilty, only, of, weakness, it, is, only, after, some, time, in, prison, that, his, redemption, and, moral, regeneration, begin, under, sonya, s, loving, influence, in, crime, and, punishment, dostoevsky, fuses, the, personality, of, his, main, character, rodion, romanovich, raskolnikov, with, his, new, anti, radical, ideological, themes, the, main, plot, involves, a, murder, as, the, result, of, ideological, intoxication, and, depicts, all, the, disastrous, moral, and, psychological, consequences, that, result, from, the, murder, raskolnikov, s, psychology, is, placed, at, the, center, and, carefully, interwoven, with, the, ideas, behind, his, transgression, every, other, feature, of, the, novel, illuminates, the, agonizing, dilemma, in, which, raskolnikov, is, caught, from, another, point, of, view, the, novel, s, plot, is, another, variation, of, a, conventional, nineteenth, century, theme, an, innocent, young, provincial, comes, to, seek, his, fortune, in, the, capital, where, he, succumbs, to, corruption, and, loses, all, traces, of, his, former, freshness, and, purity, however, as, gary, rosenshield, points, out, raskolnikov, succumbs, not, to, the, temptations, of, high, society, as, honor, de, balzac, s, rastignac, or, stendhal, s, julien, sorel, but, to, those, of, rationalistic, petersburg, raskolnikov, rodion, romanovitch, is, the, protagonist, and, the, novel, focuses, primarily, on, his, perspective, a, 23, year, old, former, student, now, destitute, raskolnikov, is, described, in, the, novel, as, exceptionally, handsome, taller, than, average, in, height, slim, well, built, with, beautiful, dark, eyes, and, dark, brown, hair, on, the, one, hand, he, is, cold, apathetic, and, antisocial, on, the, other, he, can, be, surprisingly, warm, and, compassionate, he, commits, murder, as, well, as, acts, of, impulsive, charity, his, chaotic, interaction, with, the, external, world, and, his, nihilistic, worldview, might, be, seen, as, causes, of, his, social, alienation, or, consequences, of, it, despite, its, title, the, novel, does, not, so, much, deal, with, the, crime, and, its, formal, punishment, as, with, raskolnikov, s, internal, struggle, the, torments, of, his, own, conscience, rather, than, the, legal, consequences, of, committing, the, crime, believing, society, would, be, better, for, it, raskolnikov, commits, murder, with, the, idea, that, he, possesses, enough, intellectual, and, emotional, fortitude, to, deal, with, the, ramifications, but, his, sense, of, guilt, soon, overwhelms, him, to, the, point, of, psychological, and, somatic, illness, it, is, only, in, the, epilogue, that, he, realizes, his, formal, punishment, having, decided, to, confess, and, end, his, alienation, from, society, sonya, sofya, semyonovna, marmeladova, is, the, daughter, of, a, drunkard, named,

forced, into, prostitution, to, help, her, family, raskolnikov, discerns, in, her, the, same, feelings, of, shame, and, alienation, that, he, experiences, and, she, becomes, the, first, person, to, whom, he, confesses, his, crime, sensing, his, deep, unhappiness, she, supports, him, even, though, she, was, friends, with, one, of, the, victims, lizaveta, throughout, the, novel, sonya, is, an,

with, sonya, moves, raskolnikov, towards, confession, unlike, sonya, however, porfiry, does, this, through, psychological, means, seeking, to, confuse, and, provoke, the, volatile, raskolnikov, into, a, voluntary, or, involuntary, confession, he, later, drops, these, methods, and, sincerely, urges, raskolnikov, to, confess, for, his, own, good, dostoevsky, s, letter, to, katkov, reveals, his, immediate, inspiration, to, which, he, remained, faithful, even, after, his, original, plan, evolved, into, a, much, more, ambitious, creation, a, desire, to, counteract, what, he, regarded, as, nefarious, consequences, arising, from, the, doctrines, of, russian, nihilism, in, the, novel, dostoevsky, pinpointed, the, dangers, of, both, utilitarianism, and, rationalism, the, main, ideas, of, which, inspired, the, radicals, continuing, a, fierce, criticism, he, had, already, started, with, his, notes, from, underground, dostoevsky, utilized, the, characters, dialogue, and, narrative, in, crime, and, punishment, to, articulate, an, argument, against, westernizing, ideas, he, thus, attacked, a, peculiar, russian, blend, of, french, utopian, socialism, and, benthamite, utilitarianism, which, had, developed, under, revolutionary, thinkers, such, as, nikolai, chernyshevsky, and, became, known, as, rational, egoism, the, radicals, refused, to, recognize, themselves, in, the, novel, s, pages, since, dostoevsky, pursued, nihilistic, ideas, to, their, most, extreme, consequences, dimitri, pisarev, ridiculed, the, notion, that, raskolnikov, s, ideas, could, be, identified, with, those, of, the, radicals, of, the, time, the, radicals, aims, were, altruistic, and, humanitarian, but, they, were, to, be, achieved, by, relying, on, reason, and, suppressing, the, spontaneous, outflow, of, christian, compassion, chernyshevsky, s, utilitarian, ethic, proposed, that, thought, and, will, in, man, were, subject, to, the, laws, of, physical, science, dostoevsky, believed, that, such, ideas, limited, man, to, a, product, of, physics, chemistry, and, biology, negating, spontaneous, emotional, responses, in, its, latest, variety, russian, nihilism, encouraged, the, creation, of, an, lite, of, superior, individuals, to, whom, the, hopes, of, the, future, were, to, be, entrusted, raskolnikov, exemplifies, the, potentially, disastrous, hazards, contained, in, such, an, ideal, contemporary, scholar, joseph, frank, writes, that, the, moral, psychological, traits, of, his, character, incorporate, this, antinomy, between, instinctive, kindness, sympathy, and, pity, on, the, one, hand, and, on, the, other, a, proud, and, idealistic, egoism, that, has, become, perverted, into, a, contemptuous, disdain, for, the, submissive, herd, raskolnikov, s, inner, conflict, in, the, opening, section, of, the, novel, results, in, a, utilitarian, altruistic, justification, for, the, proposed, crime, why, not, kill, a, wretched, and, useless, old, moneylender, to, alleviate, the, human, misery, dostoevsky, wants, to, show, that, this, utilitarian, style, of, reasoning, had, become, widespread, and, commonplace, it, was, by, no, means, the, solitary, invention, of, raskolnikov, s, tormented, and, disordered, mind, such, radical, and, utilitarian, ideas, act, to, reinforce, the, innate, egoism, of, raskolnikov, s, character, and, help, justify, his, contempt, for, humanity, s, lower, qualities, and, ideals, he, even, becomes, fascinated, with, the, majestic, image, of, a, napoleonic, personality, who, in, the, interests, of, a, higher, social, good, believes, that, he, possesses, a, moral, right, to, kill, indeed, his, napoleon, like, plan, impels, him, toward, a, well, calculated, murder, the, ultimate, conclusion, of, his, self, deception, with, utilitarianism, dostoevsky, was, among, the, first, to, recognize, the, symbolic, possibilities, of, city, life, and, imagery, drawn, from, the, city, i, f, i, evnin, regards, crime, and, punishment, as, the, first, great, russian, novel, in, which, the, climactic, moments, of, the, action, are, played, out, in, dirty, taverns, on, the, street, in, the, sordid, back, rooms, of, the, poor, dostoevsky, s, petersburg, is, the, city, of, unrelieved, poverty, magnificence, has, no, place, in, it, because, magnificence, is, external, formal, abstract, cold, dostoevsky, connects, the, city, s, problems, to, raskolnikov, s, thoughts, and, subsequent, actions, the, crowded, streets, and, squares, the, shabby, houses, and, taverns, the, noise, and, stench, all, are, transformed, by, dostoevsky, into, a, rich, store, of, metaphors, for, states, of, mind, donald, fanger, asserts, that, the, real, city, rendered, with, a, striking, concreteness, is, also, a, city, of, the, mind, in, the, way, that, its, atmosphere, answers, raskolnikov, s, state, and, almost, symbolizes, it, it, is, crowded, stifling, and, parched, in, his, depiction, of, petersburg, dostoevsky, accentuates, the, squalor, and, human, wretchedness, that, pass, before, raskolnikov, s, eyes, he, uses, raskolnikov, s, encounter, with, marmeladov, to, contrast, the, heartlessness, of, raskolnikov, s, convictions, with, a, christian, approach, to, poverty, and, wretchedness, dostoevsky, believes, that, the, moral, freedom, propounded, by, raskolnikov, is, a, dreadful, freedom, that, is, contained, by, no, values, because, it, is, before, values, in, seeking, to, affirm, this, freedom, in, himself, raskolnikov, is, in, perpetual, revolt, against, society, himself, and, god, he, thinks, that, he, is, self, sufficient, and, self, contained, but, at, the, end, his, boundless, self, confidence, must, disappear, in, the, face, of, what, is, greater, than, himself, and, his, self, fabricated, justification, must, humble, itself, before, the, higher, justice, of, god, dostoevsky, calls, for, the, regeneration, and, renewal, of, sick, russian, society, through, the, re, discovery, of, its, national, identity, its, religion, and, its, roots, the, novel, is, divided, into, six, parts, with, an, epilogue, the, notion, of, intrinsic, duality, in, crime, and, punishment, has, been, commented, upon, with, the, suggestion, that, there, is, a, degree, of, symmetry, to, the, book, edward, wasiolek, who, has, argued, that, dostoevsky, was, a, skilled, craftsman, highly, conscious, of, the, formal, pattern, in, his, art, has, likened, the, structure, of, crime, and, punishment, to, a, flattened, x, saying, parts, i, iii, present, the, predominantly, rational, and, proud, raskolnikov, parts, iv, vi, the, emerging, irrational, and, humble, raskolnikov, the, first, half, of, the, novel, shows, the, progressive, death, of, the, first, ruling, principle, of, his, character, the, last, half, the, progressive, birth, of, the, new, ruling, principle, the, point, of, change, comes, in, the, very, middle, of, the, novel, this, compositional, balance, is, achieved, by, means, of, the, symmetrical, distribution, of, certain, key, episodes, throughout, the, novel, s, six, parts, the, recurrence, of, these, episodes, in, the, two, halves, of, the, novel, as, david, bethea, has, argued, is, organized, according, to, a, mirror, like, principle, whereby, the, left, half, of, the, novel, reflects, the, right, half, the, seventh, part, of, the, novel, the, epilogue, has, attracted, much, attention, and, controversy, some, of, dostoevsky, s, critics, have, criticized, the, novel, s, final, pages, as, superfluous, anticlimactic, unworthy, of, the, rest, of, the, work, while, others, have, defended, it, offering, various, schemes, that, they, claim, prove, its, inevitability, and, necessity, steven, cassedy, argues, that, crime, and, punishment, is, formally, two, distinct, but, closely, related, things, namely, a, particular, type, of, tragedy, in, the, classical, greek, mold, and, a, christian, resurrection, tale, cassedy, concludes, that, the, logical, demands, of, the, tragic, model, as, such, are, satisfied, without, the, epilogue, in, crime, and, punishment, at, the, same, time, this, tragedy, contains, a, christian, component, and, the, logical, demands, of, this, element, are, met, only, by, the, resurrection, promised, in, the, epilogue, crime, and, punishment, is, written, from, a, third, person, omniscient, perspective, it, is, told, primarily, from, the, point, of, view, of, raskolnikov, but, does, at, times, switch, to, the, perspective, of, other, characters, such, as, svidriga, lov, razumikhin, luzhin, sonya, or, dunya, this, narrative, technique, which, fuses, the, narrator, very, closely, with, the, consciousness, and, point, of, view, of, the, central, characters, was, original, for, its, period, frank, notes, that, dostoevsky, s, use, of, time, shifts, of, memory, and, manipulation, of, temporal, sequence, begins, to, approach, the, later, experiments, of, henry, james, joseph, conrad, virginia, woolf, and, james, joyce, a, late, nineteenth, century, reader, was, however, accustomed, to, more, orderly, and, linear, types, of, expository, narration, this, led, to, the, persistence, of, the, legend, that, dostoevsky, was, an, untidy, and, negligent, craftsman, and, to, observations, like, the, following, by, melchior, de, vog, a, word, one, does, not, even, notice, a, small, fact, that, takes, up, only, a, line, have, their, reverberations, fifty, pages, later, the, continuity, becomes, unintelligible, if, one, skips, a, couple, of, pages, dostoevsky, uses, different, speech, mannerisms, and, sentences, of, different, length, for, different, characters, those, who, use, artificial, language, luzhin, for, example, are, identified, as, unattractive, people, mrs, marmeladov, s, disintegrating, mind, is, reflected, in, her, language, in, the, original, russian, text, the, names, of, the, major, characters, have, something, of, a, double, meaning, but, in, translation, the, subtlety, of, the, russian, language, is, predominantly, lost, due, to, differences, in, language, structure, and, culture, for, example, the, original, russian, title, is, not, the, direct, equivalent, to, the, english, crime, and, punishment, prestupl, niye, is, literally, translated, as, a, stepping, across, the, physical, image, of, crime, as, crossing, over, a, barrier, or, a, boundary, is, lost, in, translation, as, is, the, religious, implication, of, transgression, the, first, part, of, crime, and, punishment, published, in, the, january, and, february, issues, of, the, russian, messenger, met, with, public, success, in, his, memoirs, the, conservative, belletrist, nikolay, strakhov, recalled, that, in, russia, crime, and, punishment, was, the, literary, sensation, of, 1866, tolstoy, s, novel, war, and, peace, was, being, serialized, in, the, russian, messenger, at, the, same, time, as, crime, and, punishment, the, novel, soon, attracted, the, criticism, of, the, liberal, and, radical, critics, g, z, yeliseyev, sprang, to, the, defense, of, the, russian, student, corporations, and, wondered, has, there, ever, been, a, case, of, a, student, committing, murder, for, the, sake, of, robbery, pisarev, aware, of, the, novel, s, artistic, value, described, raskolnikov, as, a, product, of, his, environment, and, argued, that, the, main, theme, of, the, work, was, poverty, and, its, results, he, measured, the, novel, s, excellence, by, the, accuracy, with, which, dostoevsky, portrayed, the, contemporary, social, reality, and, focused, on, what, he, regarded, as, inconsistencies, in, the, novel, s, plot, strakhov, rejected, pisarev, s, contention, that, the, theme, of, environmental, determinism, was, essential, to, the, novel, and, pointed, out, that, dostoevsky, s, attitude, towards, his, hero, was, sympathetic, this, is, not, mockery, of, the, younger, generation, neither, a, reproach, nor, an, accusation, it, is, a, lament, over, it, solovyov, felt, that, the, meaning, of, the, novel, despite, the, common, failure, to, understand, it, is, clear, and, simple, a, man, who, considers, himself, entitled, to, step, across, discovers, that, what, he, thought, was, an, intellectually, and, even, morally, justifiable, transgression, of, an, arbitrary, law, turns, out, to, be, for, his, conscience, a, sin, a, violation, of, inner, moral, justice, that, inward, sin, of, self, idolatry, can, only, be, redeemed, by, an, inner, act, of, self, renunciation, the, early, symbolist, movement, that, dominated, russian, letters, in, the, 1880s, was, concerned, more, with, aesthetics, than, the, visceral, realism, and, intellectuality, of, crime, and, punishment, but, a, tendency, toward, mysticism, among, the, new, generation, of, symbolists, in, the, 1900s, led, to, a, reevaluation, of, the, novel, as, an, address, to, the, dialectic, of, spirit, and, matter, in, the, character, of, sonya, sofya, semyonovna, they, saw, an, embodiment, of, both, the, orthodox, feminine, principle, of, hagia, sophia, holy, wisdom, at, once, sexual, and, innocent, redemptive, both, in, her, suffering, and, her, veneration, of, suffering, and, the, most, important, feminine, deity, of, russian, folklore, mat, syra, zemlya, moist, mother, earth, raskolnikov, is, a, son, of, earth, whose, egoistic, aspirations, lead, him, to, ideas, and, actions, that, alienate, him, from, the, very, source, of, his, strength, and, he, must, bow, down, to, her, before, she, can, relieve, him, of, the, terrible, burden, of, his, guilt, philosopher, and, orthodox, theologian, nikolay, berdyaev, shared, solovyov, and, the, symbolists, sense, of, the, novel, s, spiritual, significance, seeing, it, as, an, illustration, of, the, modern, age, s, hubristic, self, deification, or, what, he, calls, the, suicide, of, man, by, self, affirmation, raskolnikov, answers, his, question, of, whether, he, has, the, right, to, kill, solely, by, reference, to, his, own, arbitrary, will, but, according, to, berdyaev, these, are, questions, that, can, only, be, answered, by, god, and, he, who, does, not, bow, before, that, higher, will, destroys, his, neighbor, and, destroys, himself, that, is, the, meaning, of, crime, and, punishment, crime, and, punishment, was, regarded, as, an, important, work, in, a, number, of, 20th, century, european, cultural, movements, notably, the, bloomsbury, group, psychoanalysis, and, existentialism, of, the, writers, associated, with, bloomsbury, virginia, woolf, john, middleton, murry, and, d, h, lawrence, are, some, of, those, who, have, discussed, the, work, freud, held, dostoevsky, s, work, in, high, esteem, and, many, of, his, followers, have, attempted, psychoanalytical, interpretations, of, raskolnikov, among, the, existentialists, sartre, and, camus, in, particular, have, acknowledged, dostoevsky, s, influence, the, affinity, of, crime, and, punishment, with, both, religious, mysticism, and, psychoanalysis, led, to, suppression, of, discussion, in, soviet, russia, interpretations, of, raskolnikov, tended, to, align, with, pisarev, s, idea, of, reaction, to, unjust, socio, economic, conditions, an, exception, was, the, work, of, mikhail, bakhtin, considered, by, many, commentators, to, be, the, most, original, and, insightful, analyst, of, dostoevsky, s, work, in, problems, of, dostoevsky, s, poetics, bakhtin, argues, that, attempts, to, understand, dostoevsky, s, characters, from, the, vantage, point, of, a, pre, existing, philosophy, or, as, individualized, objects, to, be, psychologically, analysed, will, always, fail, to, penetrate, the, unique, artistic, architechtonics, of, his, works, in, such, cases, both, the, critical, approach, and, the, assumed, object, of, investigation, are, monological, everything, is, perceived, as, occurring, within, the, framework, of, a, single, overarching, perspective, whether, that, of, the, critic, or, that, of, the, author, dostoevsky, s, art, bakhtin, argues, is, inherently, dialogical, events, proceed, on, the, basis, of, interaction, between, self, validating, subjective, voices, often, within, the, consciousness, of, an, individual, character, as, is, the, case, with, raskolnikov, raskolnikov, s, consciousness, is, depicted, as, a, battleground, for, all, the, conflicting, ideas, that, find, expression, in, the, novel, everyone, and, everything, he, encounters, becomes, reflected, and, refracted, in, a, dialogized, interior, monologue, he, has, rejected, external, relationships, and, chosen, his, tormenting, internal, dialogue, only, sonya, is, capable, of, continuing, to, engage, with, him, despite, his, cruelty, his, openness, to, dialogue, with, sonya, is, what, enables, him, to, cross, back, over, the, threshold, into, real, life, communication, confession, and, public, trial, not, out, of, guilt, for, he, avoids, acknowledging, his, guilt, but, out, of, weariness, and, loneliness, for, that, reconciling, step, is, the, only, relief, possible, from, the, cacophony, of, unfinalized, inner, dialogue, the, garnett, translation, was, the, dominant, translation, for, more, than, 80, years, after, its, publication, in, 1914, since, the, 1990s, mcduff, and, pevear, volokhonsky, have, become, its, major, competitors, there, have, been, over, 25, film, adaptations, of, crime, and, punishment, they, include, text, sources,
