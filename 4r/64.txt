fiscal, year, 2017, which, ended, on, june, 30, the, museum, was, reported, as, having, 7, million, visitors, during, the, past, year, where, 37, percent, of, these, were, international, visitors,

smith, writing, for, the, new, york, times, in, september, 2017, voiced, growing, public, concern, that, proposed, increases, in, admissions, costs, would, have, an, adverse, effect, upon, attendance, statistics, at, the, museum, smith, referred, to, the, public, perception, that, such, costs, would, appear, greedy, and, inappropriate, because, the, museum, already, gets, around, 39, million, a, year, from, its, gate, equal, to, the, entire, annual, budget, of, the, brooklyn, museum, smith, s, article, continued, to, report, the, negative, response, of, local, communities, in, the, tristate, area, surrounding, the, museum, which, was, previously, introduced, in, a, series, of, articles, by, robin, pogrebin, written, during, the, 2016, 2017, fiscal, year, at, the, museum, which, criticized, speculative, suggestions, among, current, administrators, at, the, museum, that, an, added, revenue, stream, could, be, pursued, by, the, museum, by, rescinding, existing, museum, policy, since, 1893, allowing, for, free, public, access, to, the, museum, in, january, 2018, museum, president, daniel, weiss, announced, that, the, century, old, policy, of, free, museum, admission, would,

2023, to, enter, the, museum, the, city, of, new, york, has, reduced, funding, at, the, metropolitan, as, part, of, mayor, de, blasio, s, political, effort, to, increase, artistic, diversity, they, made, an, agreement, to, allow, the, fees, in, exchange, for, less, funding, which, the, city, pledged, to, use, at, alternate, facilities, and, promote, diversity, holland, carter, and, roberta,

sale, of, mid, to, high, value, items, from, its, collection, though, the, met, had, always, sold, duplicate, or, minor, items, from, its, collection, to, fund, the, acquisition, of, new, pieces, the, met, s, new, policy, allowed, the, sale, of, important, items, with, high, values, objects, regarded, as, part, of, the, museum, s, core, collection, hoving, s, deaccessioning, practices, including, secretive, non, public, sales, that, violated, donor, wishes, was, exposed, by, john, l, hess, in, a, series, of, articles, in, the, new, york, times, these, expos, s, provoked, widespread, criticism, when, they, came, to, light, and, they, were, compounded, by, deceitful, and, misleading, statements, made, by, hoving, who, was, censured, by, the, college, art, association, and, the, art, dealers, association, of, america, adaa, this, resulted, in, an, investigation, of, the, museum, by, the, new, york, state, attorney, general, louis, j, lefkowitz, who, held, public, hearings, in, 1972, as, a, result, of, these, hearings, the, museum, agreed, to, list, in, its, annual, report, the, total, cash, proceeds, from, art, sales, each, year, and, to, itemize, any, deaccessioned, objects, valued, at, more, than, 50, 000, each, it, also, agreed, to, sell, those, pieces, at, public, auction, and, provide, advance, public, notice, of, a, work, being, sold, if, it, had, been, on, view, in, the, last, ten, years, known, as, the, hoving, affair, the, deaccessioning, scandal, has, been, written, about, by, calvin, tomkins, in, merchants, and, masterpieces, 1970, rev, ed, 1989, michael, gross, in, rogues, gallery, 2009, and, martin, gammon, deaccessioning, and, its, discontents, a, critical, history, 2018, though, the, most, comprehensive, account, remains, hess, s, 1974, book, the, grand, acquisitors, two, of, the, objects, purchased, with, funds, generated, by, hoving, s, deaccessions, were, highlights, of, the, met, s, collection, diego, vel, zquez, s, 1650, portrait, of, juan, de, pareja, bought, in, part, through, deaccessioned, works, and, a, classical, greek, vase, the, euphronios, krater, which, depicted, the, death, of, sarpedon, funded, by, the, sale, of, the, museum, s, classical, coin, collection, the, latter, which, proved, to, be, looted, was, repatriated, to, italy, in, 2006, the, met, has, sold, such, valuable, pieces, as, edward, steichen, s, 1904, photograph, the, pond, moonlight, which, it, regarded, as, a, duplicate, since, another, copy, was, already, in, the, met, s, collection, for, a, record, price, of, 2, 9, million, hoving, was, criticized, for, selling, important, works, from, the, museum, to, fund, his, acquisitions, including, a, henri, rousseau, and, a, van, gogh, and, he, planned, to, sell, many, more, including, 14, monet, paintings, he, characterized, as, routine, during, the, tenure, of, director, philippe, de, montebello, the, sale, of, a, single, monet, together, with, the, construction, of, purpose, built, galleries, eventually, led, to, the, acquisition, of, two, collections, totaling, 220, paintings, which, established, the, museum, s, remarkable, plein, air, paintings, collection, another, deaccessioning, controversy, broke, out, in, 2021, when, the, association, of, art, museum, directors, aamd, temporarily, relaxed, its, guidelines, due, to, hardships, suffered, by, museums, during, the, covid, pandemic, previously, funds, from, deaccessioned, works, were, only, to, be, used, to, purchase, other, works, for, the, permanent, collection, the, temporary, guidelines, however, permitted, these, monies, to, be, used, for, the, care, of, the, collection, the, met, decided, to, use, funds, from, deaccessions, for, collection, care, to, pay, salaries, it, was, roundly, criticized, for, this, decision, by, the, met, s, former, director, thomas, p, campbell, montebello, s, successor, by, cultural, critic, lee, rosenbaum, and, by, pulitzer, prize, winning, journalist, christopher, knight, among, others, they, argued, that, the, practice, set, a, bad, example, for, other, museums, and, that, the, met, did, not, truly, need, these, monies, one, of, the, most, serious, and, daunting, challenges, to, the, metropolitan, museum, s, respectable, reputation, has, been, a, series, of, allegations, and, lawsuits, about, its, known, status, as, an, institutional, buyer, of, looted, and, stolen, antiquities, since, the, 1990s, the, met, has, been, the, subject, of, countless, investigative, reports, and, books, critical, of, the, met, s, laissez, faire, attitude, to, acquisition, the, met, has, lost, several, major, lawsuits, notably, against, the, governments, of, italy, and, turkey, which, successfully, sought, the, repatriation, of, hundreds, of, ancient, mediterranean, and, middle, eastern, antiquities, with, a, total, value, in, the, hundreds, of, millions, of, dollars, in, august, 2022, it, was, reported, that, the, cambodian, government, was, pressuring, the, museum, to, return, khmer, artifacts, that, were, allegedly, looted, during, the, civil, war, and, the, tumultuous, period, following, in, september, 2022, new, york, law, enforcement, across, three, separate, search, warrants, seized, 27, artifacts, highlighting, ancient, rome, greece, and, egypt, with, the, intention, of, returning, them, to, italy, and, egypt, these, 27, objects, were, worth, an, aggregate, total, of, 13, million, the, items, were, seized, due, to, their, discovered, link, to, known, antiquities, traffickers, this, comes, along, with, an, international, recalculation, of, what, belongs, in, the, museums, of, the, world, similar, cases, of, repatriation, conversations, include, the, elgin, marbles, the, benin, bronzes, and, el, penacho, along, with, the, conversation, about, returning, art, the, art, community, is, calling, upon, museological, institutions, to, hold, themselves, to, a, higher, standard, of, social, justice, equity, and, ethics, on, march, 22, 2023, manhattan, prosecutors, seized, 15, allegedly, stolen, antiquities, tied, to, subhash, kapoor, in, december, 2023, the, museum, announced, it, will, return, 14, khmer, sculptures, to, cambodia, and, 2, to, thailand, after, determining, they, were, stolen, and, linked, to, art, dealer, douglas, latchford, since, 1993, charles, and, valerie, diker, have, donated, 139, indigenous, objects, to, the, museum, many, of, which, are, funerary, most, of, these, objects, have, ownership, histories, with, 200, 2, 000, year, gaps, in, known, owners, the, display, of, native, american, funerary, objects, is, problematic, not, just, because, of, its, unethical, spotlighting, of, private, ceremonial, objects, but, also, due, to, its, violation, of, nagpra, nagpra, the, native, american, graves, protection, and, repatriation, act, established, in, 1990, states, that, institutions, that, receive, federal, funding, must, work, to, repatriate, native, american, human, remains, funerary, objects, and, other, ceremonially, important, objects, this, was, done, to, ensure, that, the, respect, and, dignity, deserved, by, all, humans, was, given, to, native, americans, part, of, the, goal, of, enacting, nagpra, was, to, begin, a, dialogue, between, american, museum, institutions, and, indigenous, groups, written, into, nagpra, is, an, acknowledgement, of, museums, as, the, preservers, of, history, the, met, has, been, able, to, avoid, the, repatriation, of, valuable, objects, that, fall, under, the, grasp, of, nagpra, because, they, have, not, formally, owned, them, objects, that, are, on, permanent, or, semi, permanent, loan, to, a, museum, do, not, legally, necessitate, the, initiation, of, the, repatriation, process, as, the, diker, collection, is, slowly, incorporated, into, the, met, s, permanent, collection, the, objects, will, become, illegal, possessions, as, the, met, is, a, publicly, funded, institution, in, april, 2023, propublica, published, a, report, detailing, the, indigenous, american, collections, of, the, met, museum, the, report, exposed, the, loophole, of, loan, vs, own, that, the, met, was, using, to, cling, onto, objects, that, they, had, an, ethical, and, legal, responsibility, to, repatriate, the, report, came, to, the, conclusion, that, the, native, american, art, held, by, the, met, could, only, have, come, into, the, possession, of, the, diker, s, through, violence, looting, and, dispossession, additionally, the, report, exposed, that, only, 15, of, the, 193, objects, donated, to, the, met, by, the, diker, collection, have, known, provenance, the, report, was, the, cause, of, international, outcry, due, to, its, bold, pinpointing, of, just, some, of, the, met, s, shoddy, acquisitioning, history, this, callout, of, the, unequivocally, respected, institution, that, is, the, met, museum, caused, a, reckoning, amongst, museums, displaying, indigenous, american, art, in, response, to, this, scandal, the, met, claimed, that, they, were, in, contact, with, tribal, governments, about, creating, appropriate, displays, of, native, american, art, and, funerary, objects, but, did, not, specify, which, tribes, in, response, to, many, controversies, the, museum, issued, a, statement, on, collecting, practices, the, statement, encompasses, all, 1, 5, million, works, of, art, held, by, the, met, referencing, research, transparency, and, collaboration, this, statement, is, a, clear, redefining, of, the, met, s, outlook, on, looted, art, and, artwork, with, unknown, histories, as, a, pre, eminent, voice, in, the, global, art, community, it, is, incumbent, upon, the, met, to, engage, more, intensively, and, proactively, in, examining, certain, areas, of, our, collection, stated, max, hollein, the, directer, of, the, museum, the, met, hired, a, manager, of, provenance, research, with, a, team, of, three, staff, to, assist, the, already, employed, curators, and, historians
