music, and, lyrics, but, also, jazz, poetry, according, to, john, sobol, the, jazz, musician, and, poet, who, wrote, digitopia, blues, rap, bears, a, striking, resemblance, to, the, evolution, of, jazz, both, stylistically, and, formally, boxer, muhammad, ali, anticipated, elements, of, rap, often, using, rhyme, schemes, and, spoken, word, poetry, both, for, when, he, was, trash, talking, in,

the, 1970s, an, editor, of, the, newspaper, the, fayetteville, observer, interviewed, bill, curtis, of, the, disco, funk, music, group, the, fatback, band, in, 2020, curtis, noted, that, when, he, moved, to, the, bronx, in, the, 1970s, he, heard, people, rapping, over, scratched, records, throughout, the, neighborhoods, and, radio, djs, were, rapping, before, the, genre, was, released, on, retail, recordings, the, fatback, band, released, the, first, rap, recording, king, tim, iii, personality, jock, a, few, weeks, before, the, sugarhill, gang, in, 1979, in, another, interview, curtis, said, there, was, rapping, in, the, bronx, and, the, cats, there, had, been, doing, it, for, a, while, fatback, certainly, didn, t, invent, rap, or, anything, i, was, just, interested, in, it, and, i, guess, years, later, we, were, the, first, to, record, it, at, the, time, you, could, already, see, cats, rapping, everywhere, in, the, streets, and, doing, stuff, with, the, decline, of, disco, in, the, early, 1980s, rap, became, a, new, form, of, expression, rap, arose, from, musical, experimentation, with, rhyming, rhythmic, speech, rap, was, a, departure, from, disco, sherley, anne, williams, refers, to, the, development, of, rap, as, anti, disco, in, style, and, means, of, reproduction, the, early, productions, of, rap, after, disco, sought, a, more, simplified, manner, of, producing, the, tracks, they, were, to, sing, over, williams, explains, how, rap, composers, and, dj, s, opposed, the, heavily, orchestrated, and, ritzy, multi, tracks, of, disco, for, break, beats, which, were, created, from, compiling, different, records, from, numerous, genres, and, did, not, require, the, equipment, from, professional, recording, studios, professional, studios, were, not, necessary, therefore, opening, the, production, of, rap, to, the, youth, who, as, williams, explains, felt, locked, out, because, of, the, capital, needed, to, produce, disco, records, more, directly, related, to, the, african, american, community, were, items, like, schoolyard, chants, and, taunts, clapping, games, jump, rope, rhymes, some, with, unwritten, folk, histories, going, back, hundreds, of,

poetry, and, comedy, records, had, an, influence, on, the, first, rappers, coke, la, rock, often, credited, as, hip, hop, s, first, mc, cites, the, last, poets, among, his, influences, as, well, as, comedians, such, as, wild, man, steve, and, richard, pryor, comedian, rudy, ray, moore, released, under, the, counter, albums, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, such, as, this, pussy, belongs, to, me, 1970, which, contained, raunchy, sexually, explicit, rhymes, that, often, had, to, do, with, pimps, prostitutes, players, and, hustlers, and, which, later, led, to, him, being, called, the, godfather, of, rap, gil, scott, heron, a, jazz, poet, musician, has, been, cited, as, an, influence, on, rappers, such, as, chuck, d, and, krs, one, scott, heron, himself, was, influenced, by, melvin, van, peebles, whose, first, album, was, 1968, s, brer, soul, van, peebles, describes, his, vocal, style, as, the, old, southern, style, which, was, influenced, by, singers, he, had, heard, growing, up, in, south, chicago, van, peebles, also, said, that, he, was, influenced, by, older, forms, of, african, american, music, people, like, blind, lemon, jefferson, and, the, field, hollers, i, was, also, influenced, by, spoken, word, song, styles, from, germany, that, i, encountered, when, i, lived, in, france, during, the, mid, 20th, century, the, musical, culture, of, the, caribbean, was, constantly,

the, microphone, at, parties, and, later, into, more, complex, raps, grandmaster, caz, stated, the, microphone, was, just, used, for, making, announcements, like, when, the, next, party, was, gonna, be, or, people, s, moms, would, come, to, the, party, looking, for, them, and, you, have, to, announce, it, on, the, mic, different, djs, started, embellishing, what, they, were, saying, i, would, make, an, announcement, this, way, and, somebody, would, hear, that, and, they, add, a, little, bit, to, it, i, d, hear, it, again, and, take, it, a, little, step, further, til, it, turned, from, lines, to, sentences, to, paragraphs, to, verses, to, rhymes, one, of, the, first, rappers, at, the, beginning, of, the, hip, hop, period, at, the, end, of, the, 1970s, was, also, hip, hop, s, first, dj, dj, kool, herc, herc, a, jamaican, immigrant, started, delivering, simple, raps, at, his, parties, which, some, claim, were, inspired, by, the, jamaican, tradition, of, toasting, however, kool, herc, himself, denies, this, link, in, the, 1984, book, hip, hop, saying, jamaican, toasting, naw, naw, no, connection, there, i, couldn, t, play, reggae, in, the, bronx, people, wouldn, t, accept, it, the, inspiration, for, rap, is, james, brown, and, the, album, hustler, s, convention, herc, also, suggests, he, was, too, young, while, in, jamaica, to, get, into, sound, system, parties, i, couldn, t, get, in, couldn, t, get, in, i, was, ten, eleven, years, old, and, that, while, in, jamaica, he, was, listening, to, james, brown, i, was, listening, to, american, music, in, jamaica, and, my, favorite, artist, was, james, brown, that, s, who, inspired, me, a, lot, of, the, records, i, played, were, by, james, brown, however, in, terms, of, what, was, identified, in, the, 2010s, as, rap, the, source, came, from, manhattan, pete, dj, jones, said, the, first, person, he, heard, rap, was, dj, hollywood, a, harlem, not, bronx, native, who, was, the, house, dj, at, the, apollo, theater, kurtis, blow, also, said, the, first, person, he, heard, rhyme, was, dj, hollywood, in, a, 2014, interview, hollywood, said, i, used, to, like, the, way, frankie, crocker, would, ride, a, track, but, he, wasn, t, syncopated, to, the, track, though, i, liked, hank, spann, too, but, he, wasn, t, on, the, one, guys, back, then, weren, t, concerned, with, being, musical, i, wanted, to, flow, with, the, record, and, in, 1975, he, ushered, in, what, became, known, as, the, hip, hop, style, by, rhyming, syncopated, to, the, beat, of, an, existing, record, uninterruptedly, for, nearly, a, minute, he, adapted, the, lyrics, of, isaac, hayes, good, love, 6, 9969, and, rhymed, it, to, the, breakdown, part, of, love, is, the, message, his, partner, kevin, smith, better, known, as, lovebug, starski, took, this, new, style, and, introduced, it, to, the, bronx, hip, hop, set, that, until, then, was, composed, of, djing, and, b, boying, or, beatboxing, with, traditional, shout, out, style, rapping, the, style, that, hollywood, created, and, his, partner, introduced, to, the, hip, hop, set, quickly, became, the, standard, before, that, time, most, mc, rhymes, based, on, radio, djs, consisted, of, short, patters, that, were, disconnected, thematically, they, were, separate, unto, themselves, but, by, using, song, lyrics, hollywood, gave, his, rhyme, an, inherent, flow, and, theme, this, was, quickly, noticed, and, the, style, spread, by, the, end, of, the, 1970s, artists, such, as, kurtis, blow, and, the, sugarhill, gang, were, starting, to, receive, radio, airplay, and, make, an, impact, far, outside, of, new, york, city, on, a, national, scale, blondie, s, 1981, single, rapture, was, one, of, the, first, songs, featuring, rap, to, top, the, u, s, billboard, hot, 100, chart, old, school, rap, 1979, 84, was, easily, identified, by, its, relatively, simple, raps, according, to, allmusic, the, emphasis, was, not, on, lyrical, technique, but, simply, on, good, times, one, notable, exception, being, melle, mel, who, set, the, way, for, future, rappers, through, his, socio, political, content, and, creative, wordplay, golden, age, hip, hop, the, mid, 1980s, to, early, 90s, was, the, time, period, where, hip, hop, lyricism, went, through, its, most, drastic, transformation, writer, william, jelani, cobb, says, in, these, golden, years, a, critical, mass, of, mic, prodigies, were, literally, creating, themselves, and, their, art, form, at, the, same, time, and, allmusic, writes, rhymers, like, pe, s, chuck, d, big, daddy, kane, krs, one, and, rakim, basically, invented, the, complex, wordplay, and, lyrical, kung, fu, of, later, hip, hop, the, golden, age, is, considered, to, have, ended, around, 1993, 94, marking, the, end, of, rap, lyricism, s, most, innovative, period, flow, is, defined, as, the, rhythms, and, rhymes, of, a, hip, hop, song, s, lyrics, and, how, they, interact, the, book, how, to, rap, breaks, flow, down, into, rhyme, rhyme, schemes, and, rhythm, also, known, as, cadence, flow, is, also, sometimes, used, to, refer, to, elements, of, the, delivery, pitch, timbre, volume, as, well, though, often, a, distinction, is, made, between, the, flow, and, the, delivery, staying, on, the, beat, is, central, to, rap, s, flow, many, mcs, note, the, importance, of, staying, on, beat, in, how, to, rap, including, sean, price, mighty, casey, zion, i, vinnie, paz, fredro, starr, del, the, funky, homosapien, tech, n9ne, people, under, the, stairs, twista, b, real, mr, lif, 2mex, and, cage, mcs, stay, on, beat, by, stressing, syllables, in, time, to, the, four, beats, of, the, musical, backdrop, poetry, scholar, derek, attridge, describes, how, this, works, in, his, book, poetic, rhythm, rap, lyrics, are, written, to, be, performed, to, an, accompaniment, that, emphasizes, the, metrical, structure, of, the, verse, he, says, rap, lyrics, are, made, up, of, lines, with, four, stressed, beats, separated, by, other, syllables, that, may, vary, in, number, and, may, include, other, stressed, syllables, the, strong, beat, of, the, accompaniment, coincides, with, the, stressed, beats, of, the, verse, and, the, rapper, organizes, the, rhythms, of, the, intervening, syllables, to, provide, variety, and, surprise, the, same, technique, is, also, noted, in, the, book, how, to, rap, where, diagrams, are, used, to, show, how, the, lyrics, line, up, with, the, beat, stressing, a, syllable, on, each, of, the, four, beats, gives, the, lyrics, the, same, underlying, rhythmic, pulse, as, the, music, and, keeps, them, in, rhythm, other, syllables, in, the, song, may, still, be, stressed, but, the, ones, that, fall, in, time, with, the, four, beats, of, a, bar, are, the, only, ones, that, need, to, be, emphasized, in, order, to, keep, the, lyrics, in, time, with, the, music, in, rap, terminology, 16, bars, is, the, amount, of, time, that, rappers, are, generally, given, to, perform, a, guest, verse, on, another, artist, s, song, one, bar, is, typically, equal, to, four, beats, of, music, old, school, flows, were, relatively, basic, and, used, only, few, syllables, per, bar, simple, rhythmic, patterns, and, basic, rhyming, techniques, and, rhyme, schemes, melle, mel, is, cited, as, an, mc, who, epitomizes, the, old, school, flow, kool, moe, dee, says, from, 1970, to, 1978, we, rhymed, one, way, melle, mel, in, 1978, gave, us, the, new, cadence, we, would, use, from, 1978, to, 1986, he, s, the, first, emcee, to, explode, in, a, new, rhyme, cadence, and, change, the, way, every, emcee, rhymed, forever, rakim, the, notorious, b, i, g, and, eminem, have, flipped, the, flow, but, melle, mel, s, downbeat, on, the, two, four, kick, to, snare, cadence, is, still, the, rhyme, foundation, all, emcees, are, building, on, artists, and, critics, often, credit, rakim, with, creating, the, overall, shift, from, the, more, simplistic, old, school, flows, to, more, complex, flows, near, the, beginning, of, hip, hop, s, new, school, kool, moe, dee, says, any, emcee, that, came, after, 1986, had, to, study, rakim, just, to, know, what, to, be, able, to, do, rakim, in, 1986, gave, us, flow, and, that, was, the, rhyme, style, from, 1986, to, 1994, from, that, point, on, anybody, emceeing, was, forced, to, focus, on, their, flow, kool, moe, dee, explains, that, before, rakim, the, term, flow, was, not, widely, used, rakim, is, basically, the, inventor, of, flow, we, were, not, even, using, the, word, flow, until, rakim, came, along, it, was, called, rhyming, it, was, called, cadence, but, it, wasn, t, called, flow, rakim, created, flow, he, adds, that, while, rakim, upgraded, and, popularized, the, focus, on, flow, he, didn, t, invent, the, word, kool, moe, dee, states, that, biggie, introduced, a, newer, flow, which, dominated, from, 1994, to, 2002, and, also, says, that, method, man, was, one, of, the, emcees, from, the, early, to, mid, 90s, that, ushered, in, the, era, of, flow, rakim, invented, it, big, daddy, kane, krs, one, and, kool, g, rap, expanded, it, but, biggie, and, method, man, made, flow, the, single, most, important, aspect, of, an, emcee, s, game, he, also, cites, craig, mack, as, an, artist, who, contributed, to, developing, flow, in, the, 90s, music, scholar, adam, krims, says, the, flow, of, mcs, is, one, of, the, profoundest, changes, that, separates, out, new, sounding, from, older, sounding, music, it, is, widely, recognized, and, remarked, that, rhythmic, styles, of, many, commercially, successful, mcs, since, roughly, the, beginning, of, the, 1990s, have, progressively, become, faster, and, more, complex, he, cites, members, of, the, wu, tang, clan, nas, az, big, pun, and, ras, kass, just, to, name, a, few, as, artists, who, exemplify, this, progression, kool, moe, dee, adds, in, 2002, eminem, created, the, song, that, got, the, first, oscar, in, hip, hop, history, and, i, would, have, to, say, that, his, flow, is, the, most, dominant, right, now, 2003, there, are, many, different, styles, of, flow, with, different, terminology, used, by, different, people, stic, man, of, dead, prez, uses, the, following, terms, alternatively, music, scholar, adam, krims, uses, the, following, terms, mcs, use, many, different, rhyming, techniques, including, complex, rhyme, schemes, as, adam, krims, points, out, the, complexity, involves, multiple, rhymes, in, the, same, rhyme, complex, i, e, section, with, consistently, rhyming, words, internal, rhymes, offbeat, rhymes, there, is, also, widespread, use, of, multisyllabic, rhymes, it, has, been, noted, that, rap, s, use, of, rhyme, is, some, of, the, most, advanced, in, all, forms, of, poetry, music, scholar, adam, bradley, notes, rap, rhymes, so, much, and, with, such, variety, that, it, is, now, the, largest, and, richest, contemporary, archive, of, rhymed, words, it, has, done, more, than, any, other, art, form, in, recent, history, to, expand, rhyme, s, formal, range, and, expressive, possibilities, in, the, book, how, to, rap, masta, ace, explains, how, rakim, and, big, daddy, kane, caused, a, shift, in, the, way, mcs, rhymed, up, until, rakim, everybody, who, you, heard, rhyme, the, last, word, in, the, sentence, was, the, rhyming, the, connection, word, then, rakim, showed, us, that, you, could, put, rhymes, within, a, rhyme, now, here, comes, big, daddy, kane, instead, of, going, three, words, he, s, going, multiple, how, to, rap, explains, that, rhyme, is, often, thought, to, be, the, most, important, factor, in, rap, writing, rhyme, is, what, gives, rap, lyrics, their, musicality, many, of, the, rhythmic, techniques, used, in, rapping, come, from, percussive, techniques, and, many, rappers, compare, themselves, to, percussionists, how, to, rap, 2, identifies, all, the, rhythmic, techniques, used, in, rapping, such, as, triplets, flams, 16th, notes, 32nd, notes, syncopation, extensive, use, of, rests, and, rhythmic, techniques, unique, to, rapping, such, as, west, coast, lazy, tails, coined, by, shock, g, rapping, has, also, been, done, in, various, time, signatures, such, as, 3, 4, time, since, the, 2000s, rapping, has, evolved, into, a, style, of, rap, that, spills, over, the, boundaries, of, the, beat, closely, resembling, spoken, english, rappers, like, mf, doom, and, eminem,

the, 1990s, marked, the, beginning, of, an, era, of, popular, culture, guided, by, the, musical, influences, of, hip, hop, and, rap, itself, moving, away, from, the, influences, of, rock, music, as, rap, continued, to, develop, and, further, disseminate, it, went, on, to, influence, clothing, brands, movies, sports, and, dancing, through, popular, culture, as, rap, has, developed, to, become, more, of, a, presence, in, popular, culture, it, has, focused, itself, on, a, particular, demographic, adolescent, and, young, adults, as, such, it, has, had, a, significant, impact, on, the, modern, vernacular, of, this, portion, of, the, population, which, has, diffused, throughout, society, the, effects, of, rap, music, on, modern, vernacular, can, be, explored, through, the, study, of, semiotics, semiotics, is, the, study, of, signs, and, symbols, or, the, study, of, language, as, a, system, french, literary, theorist, roland, barthes, furthers, this, study, with, this, own, theory, of, myth, he, maintains, that, the, first, order, of, signification, is, language, and, that, the, second, is, myth, arguing, that, a, word, has, both, its, literal, meaning, and, its, mythical, meaning, which, is, heavily, dependent, on, socio, cultural, context, to, illustrate, barthes, uses, the, example, of, a, rat, it, has, a, literal, meaning, a, physical, objective, description, and, it, has, a, greater, socio, cultural, understanding, this, contextual, meaning, is, subjective, and, is, dynamic, within, society, through, barthes, semiotic, theory, of, language, and, myth, it, can, be, shown, that, rap, music, has, culturally, influenced, the, language, of, its, listeners, as, they, influence, the, connotative, message, to, words, that, already, exist, as, more, people, listen, to, rap, the, words, that, are, used, in, the, lyrics, become, culturally, bound, to, the, song, and, then, are, disseminated, through, the, conversations, that, people, have, using, these, words, most, often, the, terms, that, rappers, use, are, pre, established, words, that, have, been, prescribed, new, meaning, through, their, music, that, are, eventually, disseminated, through, social, spheres, this, newly, contextualized, word, is, called, a, neosemanticism, neosemanticisms, are, forgotten, words, that, are, often, brought, forward, from, subcultures, that, attract, the, attention, of, members, of, the, reigning, culture, of, their, time, then, they, are, brought, forward, by, the, influential, voices, in, society, in, this, case, these, figures, are, rappers, to, illustrate, the, acronym, yolo, was, popularized, by, rapper, actor, and, rnb, singer, drake, in, 2012, when, he, featured, it, in, his, own, song, the, motto, that, year, the, term, yolo, was, so, popular, that, it, was, printed, on, t, shirts, became, a, trending, hashtag, on, twitter, and, was, even, considered, as, the, inspiration, for, several, tattoos, however, although, the, rapper, may, have, come, up, with, the, acronym, the, motto, itself, was, in, no, way, first, established, by, drake, similar, messages, can, be, seen, in, many, well, known, sayings, or, as, early, as, 1896, in, the, english, translation, of, la, com, die, humaine, by, honor, de, balzac, where, one, of, his, free, spirited, characters, tells, another, you, only, live, once, another, example, of, a, neosemanticism, is, the, word, broccoli, rapper, e, 40, initially, uses, the, word, broccoli, to, refer, to, marijuana, on, his, hit, track, broccoli, in, 1993, in, contemporary, society, artists, d, r, a, m, and, lil, yachty, are, often, accredited, for, this, slang, on, for, their, hit, song, also, titled, broccoli, with, the, rise, in, technology, and, mass, media, the, dissemination, of, subcultural, terms, has, only, become, easier, dick, hebdige, author, of, subculture, the, meaning, of, style, merits, that, subcultures, often, use, music, to, vocalize, the, struggles, of, their, experiences, as, rap, is, also, the, culmination, of, a, prevalent, sub, culture, in, african, american, social, spheres, often, their, own, personal, cultures, are, disseminated, through, rap, lyrics, it, is, here, that, lyrics, can, be, categorized, as, either, historically, influenced, or, more, commonly, considered, as, slang, vernon, andrews, the, professor, of, the, course, american, studies, 111, hip, hop, culture, suggests, that, many, words, such, as, hood, homie, and, dope, are, historically, influenced, most, importantly, this, also, brings, forward, the, anarchistic, culture, of, rap, music, common, themes, from, rap, are, anti, establishment, and, instead, promote, black, excellence, and, diversity, it, is, here, that, rap, can, be, seen, to, reclaim, words, namely, nigga, a, historical, term, used, to, subjugate, and, oppress, black, people, in, america, this, word, has, been, reclaimed, by, black, americans, and, is, heavily, used, in, rap, music, niggaz, with, attitude, embodies, this, notion, by, using, it, as, the, first, word, of, their, influential, rap, group, name, there, are, two, kinds, of, freestyle, rap, one, is, scripted, recitation, but, having, no, particular, overriding, subject, matter, and, has, yet, evolved, since, the, late, 2000s, to, become, the, most, commonly, referred, to, style, when, the, term, freestyle, is, being, used, its, primary, focus, has, morphed, from, making, up, a, rap, on, the, spot, to, being, able, to, recite, memorized, or, written, lyrics, over, an, undisclosed, beat, not, revealed, until, the, performance, actually, begins, a, variation, is, when, a, dj, or, host, will, use, multiple, beats, and, will, rotate, them, dynamically, it, is, the, freestyler, s, job, to, keep, his, or, her, flow, and, not, appear, to, trip, up, when, the, beat, switches, alternatively, keeping, the, rhythm, or, flow, going, can, be, substituted, by, switching, styles, this, involves, the, rapper, doing, a, variation, of, changing, one, s, voice, or, tone, and, or, the, rhythm, or, flow, and, potentially, much, more, however, this, must, be, done, smoothly, else, any, notoriety, or, respect, gained, can, very, quickly, be, lost, all, together, some, rappers, have, multiple, characters, egos, or, styles, in, their, repertoire, the, second, more, difficult, and, respected, style, has, adapted, the, terms, off, the, dome, or, off, the, top, in, addition, to, relatively, less, common, older, references, like, spitting, on, the, spot, and, unscripted, often, times, these, terms, are, followed, by, freestyle, e, g, killer, off, top, freestyle, by, artist, x, this, type, of, rapping, requires, the, artist, to, both, spit, their, lyrics, over, undisclosed, and, possibly, rotating, beats, but, additionally, primarily, completely, improvise, the, session, s, rapped, lyrics, many, off, top, rappers, inadvertently, reuse, old, lines, or, even, cheat, by, preparing, segments, or, entire, verses, in, advance, therefore, off, the, dome, freestyles, with, proven, spontaneity, are, valued, above, generic, always, usable, or, rehearsed, lines, or, bars, rappers, will, often, reference, places, or, objects, in, their, immediate, setting, or, specific, usually, demeaning, characteristics, of, opponents, to, prove, their, authenticity, and, originality, battle, rapping, which, can, be, freestyled, is, the,

employed, famously, by, muhammad, ali, in, his, boxing, matches, the, winner, of, a, battle, is, decided, by, the, crowd, and, or, preselected, judges, according, to, kool, moe, dee, a, successful,

like, how, they, talk, or, what, they, wear, it, also, allows, the, rapper, to, reverse, a, line, used, to, diss, him, or, her, if, they, are, the, second, rapper, to, battle, this, is, known, as, a,
