a, cymbal, is, a, common, percussion, instrument, often, used, in, pairs, cymbals, consist, of, thin, normally, round, plates, of, various, alloys, the, majority, of, cymbals, are, of, indefinite, pitch, although, small, disc, shaped, cymbals, based, on, ancient, designs, sound, a, definite, note, such, as, crotales, cymbals, are, used, in, many, ensembles, ranging, from, the, orchestra, percussion, ensembles, jazz, bands, heavy, metal, bands, and, marching, groups, drum, kits, usually, incorporate, at, least, a, crash, ride, or, crash, ride, and, a, pair, of, hi, hat, cymbals, a, player, of, cymbals, is, known, as, a, cymbalist, the, word, cymbal, is, derived, from, the, latin, cymbalum, which, is, the, latinisation, from, greek, kymbalon, cymbal, which, in, turn, derives, from, ancient, greek, kymb, cup, bowl, in, orchestral, scores, cymbals, may, be, indicated, by, the, french, cymbales, german, becken, schellbecken, teller, or, tschinellen, italian, piatti, or, cinelli, and, spanish, platillos, many, of, these, derive, from, the, word, for, plates, cymbals, have, existed, since, ancient, times, representations, of, cymbals, may, be, found, in, reliefs, and, paintings, from, armenian, highlands, 7th, century, bc, larsa, babylon, assyria, ancient, egypt, ancient, greece, and, ancient, rome, references, to, cymbals, also, appear, throughout, the, bible, through, many, psalms, and, songs, of, praise, to, god, cymbals, may, have, been, introduced, to, china, from, central, asia, in, the, 3rd, or, 4th, century, ad, in, india, cymbals, have, been, in, use, since, ancient, times, and, are, still, used, across, almost, all, major, temples, and, buddhist, sites, gigantic, aartis, along, the, ganges, which, are, revered, by, hindus, all, over, the, world, are, incomplete, without, large, cymbals, the, shahnameh, circa, 977, and, 1010, ce, mentions, the, use, of, cymbals, at, least, 14, times, in, its, text, most, in, the, context, of, creating, a, loud, din, in, war, to, frighten, the, enemy, or, to, celebrate, the, persian, word, is, sanj, or, senj, but, the, shahnameh, does, not, claim, these, to, be, persian, in, origin, several, times, it, calls, then, indian, cymbals, other, adjectives, to, describe, them, include, golden, and, brass, and, to, play, them, is, to, clash, them, a, different, form, is, called, sanj, angshati, these, are, zill, besides, the, original, use, in, war, another, use, in, persian, culture, was, the, ashura, ceremony, originally, in, the, ceremony, two, pieces, of, stone, were, beaten, on, the, sides, of, the, mourner, with, special, movements, accompanied, by, a, lamentation, song, this, has, been, replaced, by, beating, karbzani, or, karebzani, and, playing, sanj, and, ratchets, cities, where, this, has, been, performed, include, lahijan, and, aran, of, kashan, as, well, as, semnan, and, sabzevar, all, theories, about, the, etymology, of, the, word, sanj, identify, it, as, a, pahlavi, word, by, some, accounts, means, weight, and, it, is, possible, that, the, original, term, was, sanjk, b, meaning, striking, weights, by, some, accounts, the, word, is, reform, version, of, zang, bell, referring, to, its, bell, shaped, plate, cymbals, were, employed, by, turkish, janissaries, in, the, 14th, century, or, earlier, by, the, 17th, century, such, cymbals, were, used, in, european, music, and, more, commonly, played, in, military, bands, and, orchestras, by, the, mid, 18th, century, since, the, 19th, century, some, composers, have, called, for, larger, roles, for, cymbals, in, musical, works, and, a, variety, of, cymbal, shapes, techniques, and, hardware, have, been, developed, in, response, the, anatomy, of, the, cymbal, plays, a, large, part, in, the, sound, it, creates, a, hole, is, drilled, in, the, center, of, the, cymbal, which, is, used, to, either, mount, the, cymbal, on, a, stand, or, for, tying, straps, through, for, hand, playing, the, bell, dome, or, cup, is, the, raised, section, immediately, surrounding, the, hole, the, bell, produces, a, higher, pinging, pitch, than, the, rest, of, the, cymbal, the, bow, is, the, rest, of, the, surface, surrounding, the, bell, the, bow, is, sometimes, described, in, two, areas, the, ride, and, crash, area, the, ride, area, is, the, thicker, section, closer, to, the, bell, while, the, crash, area, is, the, thinner, tapering, section, near, the, edge, the, edge, or, rim, is, the, immediate, circumference, of, the, cymbal, cymbals, are, measured, by, their, diameter, either, in, inches, or, centimeters, the, size, of, the, cymbal, affects, its, sound, larger, cymbals, usually, being, louder, and, having, longer, sustain, the, weight, describes, how, thick, the, cymbal, is, cymbal, weights, are, important, to, the, sound, they, produce, and, how, they, play, heavier, cymbals, have, a, louder, volume, more, cut, and, better, stick, articulation, when, using, drum, sticks, thin, cymbals, have, a, fuller, sound, lower, pitch, and, faster, response, the, profile, of, the, cymbal, is, the, vertical, distance, of, the, bow, from, the, bottom, of, the, bell, to, the, cymbal, edge, higher, profile, cymbals, are, more, bowl, shaped, the, profile, affects, the, pitch, of, the, cymbal, higher, profile, cymbals, have, higher, pitch, cymbals, offer, a, composer, nearly, endless, amounts, of, color, and, effect, their, unique, timbre, allows, them, to, project, even, against, a, full, orchestra, and, through, the, heaviest, of, orchestrations, and, enhance, articulation, and, nearly, any, dynamic, cymbals, have, been, utilized, historically, to, suggest, frenzy, fury, or, bacchanalian, revels, as, seen, in, the, venus, music, in, wagner, s, tannh, user, grieg, s, peer, gynt, suite, and, osmin, s, aria, o, wie, will, ich, triumphieren, from, mozart, s, die, entf, hrung, aus, dem, serail, orchestral, clash, cymbals, are, traditionally, used, in, pairs, each, one, having, a, strap, set, in, the, bell, of, the, cymbal, by, which, they, are, held, such, a, pair, is, known, as, clash, cymbals, crash, cymbals, hand, cymbals, or, plates, certain, sounds, can, be, obtained, by, rubbing, their, edges, together, in, a, sliding, movement, for, a, sizzle, striking, them, against, each, other, in, what, is, called, a, crash, tapping, the, edge, of, one, against, the, body, of, the, other, in, what, is, called, a, tap, crash, scraping, the, edge, of, one, from, the, inside, of, the, bell, to, the, edge, for, a, scrape, or, zischen, or, shutting, the, cymbals, together, and, choking, the, sound, in, what, is, called, a, hi, hat, or, crush, a, skilled, percussionist, can, obtain, an, enormous, dynamic, range, from, such, cymbals, for, example, in, beethoven, s, symphony, no, 9, the, percussionist, is, employed, to, first, play, cymbals, pianissimo, adding, a, touch, of, colour, rather, than, loud, crash, crash, cymbals, are, usually, damped, by, pressing, them, against, the, percussionist, s, body, a, composer, may, write, laissez, vibrer, or, let, vibrate, usually, abbreviated, l, v, secco, dry, or, equivalent, indications, on, the, score, more, usually, the, percussionist, must, judge, when, to, damp, based, on, the, written, duration, of, a, crash, and, the, context, in, which, it, occurs, crash, cymbals, have, traditionally, been, accompanied, by, the, bass, drum, playing, an, identical, part, this, combination, played, loudly, is, an, effective, way, to, accentuate, a, note, since, it, contributes, to, both, very, low, and, very, high, frequency, ranges, and, provides, a, satisfying, crash, bang, wallop, in, older, music, the, composer, sometimes, provided, one, part, for, this, pair, of, instruments, writing, senza, piatti, or, piatti, soli, italian, without, cymbals, or, cymbals, only, if, only, one, is, needed, this, came, from, the, common, practice, of, having, one, percussionist, play, using, one, cymbal, mounted, to, the, shell, of, the, bass, drum, the, percussionist, would, crash, the, cymbals, with, the, left, hand, and, use, a, mallet, to, strike, the, bass, drum, with, the, right, this, method, is, nowadays, often, employed, in, pit, orchestras, and, called, for, specifically, by, composers, who, desire, a, certain, effect, stravinsky, calls, for, this, in, his, ballet, petrushka, and, mahler, calls, for, this, in, his, titan, symphony, the, modern, convention, is, for, the, instruments, to, have, independent, parts, however, in, kit, drumming, a, cymbal, crash, is, still, most, often, accompanied, by, a, simultaneous, kick, to, the, bass, drum, which, provides, a, musical, effect, and, support, to, the, crash, crash, cymbals, evolved, into, the, low, sock, and, from, this, to, the, modern, hi, hat, even, in, a, modern, drum, kit, they, remain, paired, with, the, bass, drum, as, the, two, instruments, which, are, played, with, the, player, s, feet, however, hi, hat, cymbals, tend, to, be, heavy, with, little, taper, more, similar, to, a, ride, cymbal, than, to, a, clash, cymbal, as, found, in, a, drum, kit, and, perform, a, ride, rather, than, a, crash, function, another, use, of, cymbals, is, the, suspended, cymbal, this, instrument, takes, its, name, from, the, traditional, method, of, suspending, the, cymbal, by, means, of, a, leather, strap, or, rope, thus, allowing, the, cymbal, to, vibrate, as, freely, as, possible, for, maximum, musical, effect, early, jazz, drumming, pioneers, borrowed, this, style, of, cymbal, mounting, during, the, early, 1900s, and, later, drummers, further, developed, this, instrument, into, the, mounted, horizontal, or, nearly, horizontally, mounted, crash, cymbals, of, a, modern, drum, kit, instead, of, a, leather, strap, suspension, system, many, modern, drum, kits, use, a, mount, with, felt, or, otherwise, dampening, fabric, to, act, as, a, barrier, to, hold, the, cymbals, between, metal, clamps, thus, forming, the, modern, day, ride, cymbal, suspended, cymbals, can, be, played, with, yarn, sponge, or, cord, wrapped, mallets, the, first, known, instance, of, using, a, sponge, headed, mallet, on, a, cymbal, is, the, final, chord, of, hector, berlioz, symphonie, fantastique, composers, sometimes, specifically, request, other, types, of, mallets, like, felt, mallets, or, timpani, mallets, for, different, attack, and, sustain, qualities, suspended, cymbals, can, produce, bright, and, slicing, tones, when, forcefully, struck, and, give, an, eerie, transparent, windy, sound, when, played, quietly, a, tremolo, or, roll, played, with, two, mallets, alternately, striking, on, opposing, sides, of, the, cymbal, can, build, in, volume, from, almost, inaudible, to, an, overwhelming, climax, in, a, satisfyingly, smooth, manner, as, in, humperdinck, s, mother, goose, suite, the, edge, of, a, suspended, cymbal, may, be, hit, with, the, shoulder, of, a, drum, stick, to, obtain, a, sound, somewhat, akin, to, that, of, clash, cymbals, other, methods, of, playing, include, scraping, a, coin, or, triangle, beater, rapidly, across, the, ridges, on, the, top, of, the, cymbal, giving, a, zing, sound, as, some, percussionists, do, in, the, fourth, movement, of, dvo, k, s, symphony, no, 9, other, effects, that, can, be, used, include, drawing, a, bass, bow, across, the, edge, of, the, cymbal, for, a, sound, like, squealing, car, brakes, ancient, antique, or, tuned, cymbals, are, much, more, rarely, called, for, their, timbre, is, entirely, different, more, like, that, of, small, hand, bells, or, of, the, notes, of, the, keyed, harmonica, they, are, not, struck, full, against, each, other, but, by, one, of, their, edges, and, the, note, given, in, by, them, is, higher, in, proportion, as, they, are, thicker, and, smaller, berlioz, s, romeo, and, juliet, calls, for, two, pairs, of, cymbals, modeled, on, some, old, pompeian, instruments, no, larger, than, the, hand, some, are, no, larger, than, a, large, coin, and, tuned, to, f, and, b, flat, the, modern, instruments, descended, from, this, line, are, the, crotales, cymbal, types, include
