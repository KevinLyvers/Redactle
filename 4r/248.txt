https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summa_Theologica
the, summa, theologiae, or, summa, theologica, transl, summary, of, theology, often, referred, to, simply, as, the, summa, is, the, best, known, work, of, thomas, aquinas, 1225, 1274, a, scholastic, theologian, and, doctor, of, the, church, it, is, a, compendium, of, all, of, the, main, theological, teachings, of, the, catholic, church, intended, to, be, an, instructional, guide, for, theology, students, including, seminarians, and, the, literate, laity, presenting, the, reasoning, for, almost, all, points, of, christian, theology, in, the, west, topics, of, the, summa, follow, the, following, cycle, god, creation, man, man, s, purpose, christ, the, sacraments, and, back, to, god, although, unfinished, it, is, one, of, the, classics, of, the, history, of, philosophy, and, one, of, the, most, influential, works, of, western, literature, it, remains, aquinas, most, perfect, work, the, fruit, of, his, mature, years, in, which, the, thought, of, his, whole, life, is, condensed, throughout, the, summa, aquinas, cites, christian, muslim, hebrew, and, pagan, sources, including, but, not, limited, to, christian, sacred, scripture, aristotle, augustine, of, hippo, avicenna, averroes, al, ghazali, boethius, john, of, damascus, paul, the, apostle, pseudo, dionysius, maimonides, anselm, of, canterbury, plato, cicero, and, john, scotus, eriugena, the, summa, is, a, more, structured, and, expanded, version, of, aquinas, s, earlier, summa, contra, gentiles, though, the, two, were, written, for, different, purposes, the, summa, theologiae, intended, to, explain, the, christian, faith, to, beginning, theology, students, whereas, the, summa, contra, gentiles, to, explain, the, christian, faith, and, defend, it, in, hostile, situations, with, arguments, adapted, to, the, intended, circumstances, of, its, use, each, article, refuting, a, certain, belief, or, a, specific, heresy, aquinas, conceived, the, summa, specifically, as, a, work, suited, to, beginning, students, quia, catholicae, veritatis, doctor, non, solum, provectos, debet, instruere, sed, ad, eum, pertinet, etiam, incipientes, erudire, secundum, illud, apostoli, i, ad, corinth, iii, tanquam, parvulis, in, christo, lac, vobis, potum, dedi, non, escam, propositum, nostrae, intentionis, in, hoc, opere, est, ea, quae, ad, christianam, religionem, pertinent, eo, modo, tradere, secundum, quod, congruit, ad, eruditionem, incipientium, because, a, doctor, of, catholic, truth, ought, not, only, to, teach, the, proficient, but, to, him, pertains, also, to, instruct, beginners, as, the, apostle, says, in, 1, corinthians, 3, 1, 2, as, to, infants, in, christ, i, gave, you, milk, to, drink, not, meat, our, proposed, intention, in, this, work, is, to, convey, those, things, that, pertain, to, the, christian, religion, in, a, way, that, is, fitting, to, the, instruction, of, beginners, it, was, while, teaching, at, the, santa, sabina, studium, provinciale, the, forerunner, of, the, santa, maria, sopra, minerva, studium, generale, and, college, of, saint, thomas, which, in, the, 20th, century, would, become, the, pontifical, university, of, saint, thomas, aquinas, angelicum, that, aquinas, began, to, compose, the, summa, he, completed, the, prima, pars, first, part, in, its, entirety, and, circulated, it, in, italy, before, departing, to, take, up, his, second, regency, as, professor, at, the, university, of, paris, 1269, 1272, not, only, has, the, summa, theologiae, been, one, of, the, main, intellectual, inspirations, for, thomistic, philosophy, but, it, also, had, such, a, great, influence, on, dante, alighieri, s, divine, comedy, that, dante, s, epic, poem, has, been, called, the, summa, in, verse, even, today, both, in, western, and, eastern, catholic, churches, and, the, mainline, protestant, denominations, anglicanism, lutheranism, methodism, and, reformed, christianity, it, is, very, common, for, the, summa, theologiae, to, be, a, major, reference, for, those, seeking, ordination, to, the, diaconate, or, priesthood, or, for, professed, male, or, female, religious, life, or, for, laypersons, studying, philosophy, and, theology, at, the, collegiate, level, the, summa, is, structured, into, questions, are, specific, topics, of, discussion, whereas, their, corresponding, articles, are, further, specified, facets, of, the, parent, question, for, example, part, i, question, 2, the, existence, of, god, is, divided, into, three, articles, 1, whether, the, existence, of, god, is, self, evident, 2, whether, it, can, be, demonstrated, that, god, exists, and, 3, whether, god, exists, additionally, questions, on, a, broader, theme, are, grouped, into, treatises, though, the, category, of, treatise, is, reported, differently, depending, on, the, source, the, summa, s, three, parts, have, a, few, other, major, subdivisions, the, method, of, exposition, undertaken, in, the, articles, of, the, summa, is, derived, from, averroes, to, whom, aquinas, refers, respectfully, as, the, commentator, the, standard, format, for, articles, of, the, summa, is, as, follows, consider, the, example, of, part, iii, question, 40, of, christ, s, manner, of, life, article, 3, whether, christ, should, have, led, a, life, of, poverty, in, this, world, part, ii, of, the, summa, is, divided, into, two, parts, prima, secundae, and, secunda, secundae, cited, respectively, as, 1a2, and, 2a2, the, first, part, comprises, 114, questions, while, the, second, part, comprises, 189, the, two, parts, of, the, second, part, are, usually, presented, as, containing, several, treatises, the, contents, are, as, follows, the, summa, makes, many, references, to, certain, thinkers, held, in, great, respect, in, aquinas, s, time, the, arguments, from, authority, or, sed, contra, arguments, are, almost, entirely, based, on, citations, from, these, authors, some, were, called, by, special, names, st, thomas, s, greatest, work, was, the, summa, and, it, is, the, fullest, presentation, of, his, views, he, worked, on, it, from, the, time, of, clement, iv, after, 1265, until, the, end, of, his, life, when, he, died, he, had, reached, question, 90, of, part, iii, on, the, subject, of, penance, what, was, lacking, was, added, afterwards, from, the, fourth, book, of, his, commentary, on, the, sentences, of, peter, lombard, as, a, supplementum, which, is, not, found, in, manuscripts, of, the, 13th, and, 14th, centuries, the, summa, was, translated, into, greek, apparently, by, maximus, planudes, around, 1327, and, armenian, many, european, languages, and, chinese, the, structure, of, the, summa, theologiae, is, meant, to, reflect, the, cyclic, nature, of, the, cosmos, in, the, sense, of, the, emission, and, return, of, the, many, from, and, to, the, one, in, platonism, cast, in, terms, of, christian, theology, the, procession, of, the, material, universe, from, divine, essence, the, culmination, of, creation, in, man, and, the, motion, of, man, back, towards, god, by, way, of, christ, and, the, sacraments, the, structure, of, the, work, reflects, this, cyclic, arrangement, it, begins, with, god, and, his, existence, in, question, 2, the, entire, first, part, of, the, summa, deals, with, god, and, his, creation, which, reaches, its, zenith, in, man, the, first, part, therefore, ends, with, the, treatise, on, man, the, second, part, of, the, summa, deals, with, man, s, purpose, the, meaning, of, life, which, is, happiness, the, ethics, detailed, in, this, part, are, a, summary, of, the, ethics, aristotelian, in, nature, that, man, must, follow, to, reach, his, intended, destiny, since, no, man, on, his, own, can, truly, live, the, perfect, ethical, life, and, therefore, reach, god, it, was, necessary, that, a, perfect, man, bridge, the, gap, between, god, and, man, thus, god, became, man, the, third, part, of, the, summa, therefore, deals, with, the, life, of, christ, in, order, to, follow, the, way, prescribed, by, this, perfect, man, in, order, to, live, with, god, s, grace, which, is, necessary, for, man, s, salvation, the, sacraments, have, been, provided, the, final, part, of, the, summa, considers, the, sacraments, the, first, part, of, the, summa, is, summed, up, in, the, premise, that, god, governs, the, world, as, the, universal, first, cause, god, sways, the, intellect, he, gives, the, power, to, know, and, impresses, the, species, intelligibiles, on, the, mind, and, he, sways, the, will, in, that, he, holds, the, good, before, it, as, aim, creating, the, virtus, volendi, to, will, is, nothing, else, than, a, certain, inclination, toward, the, object, of, the, volition, which, is, the, universal, good, god, works, all, in, all, but, so, that, things, also, themselves, exert, their, proper, efficiency, here, the, areopagitic, ideas, of, the, graduated, effects, of, created, things, play, their, part, in, st, thomas, s, thought, part, i, treats, of, god, who, is, the, first, cause, himself, uncaused, primum, movens, immobile, and, as, such, existent, only, in, act, actu, i, e, pure, actuality, without, potentiality, and, therefore, without, corporeality, his, essence, is, actus, purus, et, perfectus, this, follows, from, the, fivefold, proof, for, the, existence, of, god, namely, there, must, be, a, first, mover, unmoved, a, first, cause, in, the, chain, of, causes, an, absolutely, necessary, being, an, absolutely, perfect, being, and, a, rational, designer, in, this, connection, the, thoughts, of, the, unity, infinity, unchangeability, and, goodness, of, the, highest, being, are, deduced, as, god, rules, in, the, world, the, plan, of, the, order, of, things, preexists, in, him, in, other, words, his, providence, and, the, exercise, of, it, in, his, government, are, what, condition, as, cause, everything, which, comes, to, pass, in, the, world, hence, follows, predestination, from, eternity, some, are, destined, to, eternal, life, while, as, concerns, others, he, permits, some, to, fall, short, of, that, end, reprobation, is, more, than, mere, foreknowledge, it, is, the, will, of, permitting, anyone, to, fall, into, sin, and, incur, the, penalty, of, condemnation, for, sin, the, effect, of, predestination, is, grace, since, god, is, the, first, cause, of, everything, he, is, the, cause, of, even, the, free, acts, of, men, through, predestination, determinism, is, deeply, grounded, in, the, system, of, st, thomas, things, with, their, source, of, becoming, in, god, are, ordered, from, eternity, as, means, for, the, realization, of, his, end, in, himself, on, moral, grounds, st, thomas, advocates, freedom, energetically, but, with, his, premises, he, can, have, in, mind, only, the, psychological, form, of, self, motivation, nothing, in, the, world, is, accidental, or, free, although, it, may, appear, so, in, reference, to, the, proximate, cause, from, this, point, of, view, miracles, become, necessary, in, themselves, and, are, to, be, considered, merely, as, inexplicable, to, man, from, the, point, of, view, of, the, first, cause, all, is, unchangeable, although, from, the, limited, point, of, view, of, the, secondary, cause, miracles, may, be, spoken, of, in, his, doctrine, of, the, trinity, aquinas, starts, from, the, augustinian, system, since, god, has, only, the, functions, of, thinking, and, willing, only, two, processiones, can, be, asserted, from, the, father, but, these, establish, definite, relations, of, the, persons, of, the, trinity, one, to, another, the, relations, must, be, conceived, as, real, and, not, as, merely, ideal, for, as, with, creatures, relations, arise, through, certain, accidents, since, in, god, there, is, no, accident, but, all, is, substance, it, follows, that, the, relation, really, existing, in, god, is, the, same, as, the, essence, according, to, the, thing, from, another, side, the, relations, as, real, must, be, really, distinguished, one, from, another, therefore, three, persons, are, to, be, affirmed, in, god, man, stands, opposite, to, god, he, consists, of, soul, and, body, the, intellectual, soul, consists, of, intellect, and, will, furthermore, the, soul, is, the, absolutely, indivisible, form, of, man, it, is, immaterial, substance, but, not, one, and, the, same, in, all, men, as, the, averroists, assumed, the, soul, s, power, of, knowing, has, two, sides, a, passive, the, intellectus, possibilis, and, an, active, the, intellectus, agens, it, is, the, capacity, to, form, concepts, and, to, abstract, the, mind, s, images, species, from, the, objects, perceived, by, sense, but, since, what, the, intellect, abstracts, from, individual, things, is, universal, the, mind, knows, the, universal, primarily, and, directly, and, knows, the, singular, only, indirectly, by, virtue, of, a, certain, reflexio, cf, scholasticism, as, certain, principles, are, immanent, in, the, mind, for, its, speculative, activity, so, also, a, special, disposition, of, works, or, the, synderesis, rudiment, of, conscience, is, inborn, in, the, practical, reason, affording, the, idea, of, the, moral, law, of, nature, so, important, in, medieval, ethics, the, second, part, of, the, summa, follows, this, complex, of, ideas, its, theme, is, man, s, striving, for, the, highest, end, which, is, the, blessedness, of, the, visio, beata, here, st, thomas, develops, his, system, of, ethics, which, has, its, root, in, aristotle, in, a, chain, of, acts, of, will, man, strives, for, the, highest, end, they, are, free, acts, insofar, as, man, has, in, himself, the, knowledge, of, their, end, and, therein, the, principle, of, action, in, that, the, will, wills, the, end, it, wills, also, the, appropriate, means, chooses, freely, and, completes, the, consensus, whether, the, act, is, good, or, evil, depends, on, the, end, the, human, reason, pronounces, judgment, concerning, the, character, of, the, end, it, is, therefore, the, law, for, action, human, acts, are, meritorious, insofar, as, they, promote, the, purpose, of, god, and, his, honor, by, repeating, a, good, action, man, acquires, a, moral, habit, or, a, quality, that, enables, him, to, do, the, good, gladly, and, easily, this, is, true, only, of, the, intellectual, and, moral, virtues, which, st, thomas, treats, after, the, manner, of, aristotle, the, theological, virtues, are, imparted, by, god, to, man, as, a, disposition, from, which, the, acts, here, proceed, while, they, strengthen, they, do, not, form, it, the, disposition, of, evil, is, the, opposite, alternative, an, act, becomes, evil, through, deviation, from, the, reason, and, from, divine, moral, law, therefore, sin, involves, two, factors, sin, has, its, origin, in, the, will, which, decides, against, reason, for, a, changeable, good, since, the, will, also, moves, the, other, powers, of, man, sin, has, its, seat, in, these, too, by, choosing, such, a, lower, good, as, its, end, the, will, is, misled, by, self, love, so, that, this, works, as, cause, in, every, sin, god, is, not, the, cause, of, sin, since, on, the, contrary, he, draws, all, things, to, himself, but, from, another, side, god, is, the, cause, of, all, things, so, he, is, efficacious, also, in, sin, as, actio, but, not, as, ens, the, devil, is, not, directly, the, cause, of, sin, but, he, incites, the, imagination, and, the, sensuous, impulse, of, man, as, men, or, things, may, also, do, sin, is, original, sin, adam, s, first, sin, passes, through, himself, to, all, the, succeeding, race, because, he, is, the, head, of, the, human, race, and, by, virtue, of, procreation, human, nature, is, transmitted, and, along, with, nature, its, infection, the, powers, of, generation, are, therefore, designated, especially, as, infected, the, thought, is, involved, here, by, the, fact, that, st, thomas, like, other, scholastics, believed, in, creationism, he, therefore, taught, that, souls, are, created, by, god, two, things, according, to, st, thomas, constituted, man, s, righteousness, in, paradise, both, are, lost, through, original, sin, which, in, form, is, the, loss, of, original, righteousness, the, consequence, of, this, loss, is, the, disorder, and, maiming, of, man, s, nature, which, shows, itself, in, ignorance, malice, moral, weakness, and, especially, in, concupiscentia, which, is, the, material, principle, of, original, sin, the, course, of, thought, here, is, as, follows, when, the, first, man, transgressed, the, order, of, his, nature, appointed, by, nature, and, grace, he, and, with, him, the, human, race, lost, this, order, this, negative, state, is, the, essence, of, original, sin, from, it, follow, an, impairment, and, perversion, of, human, nature, in, which, thenceforth, lower, aims, rule, contrary, to, nature, and, release, the, lower, element, in, man, since, sin, is, contrary, to, the, divine, order, it, is, guilt, and, subject, to, punishment, guilt, and, punishment, correspond, to, each, other, and, since, the, apostasy, from, the, invariable, good, which, is, infinite, fulfilled, by, man, is, unending, it, merits, everlasting, punishment, god, works, even, in, sinners, to, draw, them, to, the, end, by, instructing, through, the, law, and, aiding, by, grace, the, law, is, the, precept, of, the, practical, reason, as, the, moral, law, of, nature, it, is, the, participation, of, the, reason, in, the, all, determining, eternal, reason, but, since, man, falls, short, in, his, appropriation, of, this, law, of, reason, there, is, need, of, a, divine, law, and, since, the, law, applies, to, many, complicated, relations, the, practicae, dispositiones, of, the, human, law, must, be, laid, down, the, divine, law, consists, of, an, old, and, a, new, insofar, as, the, old, divine, law, contains, the, moral, law, of, nature, it, is, universally, valid, what, there, is, in, it, beyond, this, is, only, valid, for, the, jews, the, new, law, is, primarily, grace, itself, and, so, a, law, given, within, a, gift, superadded, to, nature, by, grace, but, not, a, written, law, in, this, sense, as, sacramental, grace, the, new, law, justifies, it, contains, an, ordering, of, external, and, internal, conduct, and, so, regarded, is, as, a, matter, of, course, identical, with, both, the, old, law, and, the, law, of, nature, the, consilia, show, how, one, may, attain, the, end, better, and, more, expediently, by, full, renunciation, of, worldly, goods, since, man, is, sinner, and, creature, he, needs, grace, to, reach, the, final, end, the, first, cause, alone, is, able, to, reclaim, him, to, the, final, end, this, is, true, after, the, fall, although, it, was, needful, before, grace, is, on, one, side, the, free, act, of, god, and, on, the, other, side, the, effect, of, this, act, the, gratia, infusa, or, gratia, creata, a, habitus, infusus, that, is, instilled, into, the, essence, of, the, soul, a, certain, gift, of, disposition, something, supernatural, proceeding, from, god, into, man, grace, is, a, supernatural, ethical, character, created, in, man, by, god, which, comprises, in, itself, all, good, both, faith, and, love, justification, by, grace, comprises, four, elements, grace, is, a, transmutation, of, the, human, soul, that, takes, place, instantaneously, a, creative, act, of, god, enters, which, executes, itself, as, a, spiritual, motive, in, a, psychological, form, corresponding, to, the, nature, of, man, semi, pelagian, tendencies, are, far, removed, from, st, thomas, in, that, man, is, created, anew, he, believes, and, loves, and, now, sin, is, forgiven, then, begins, good, conduct, grace, is, the, beginning, of, meritorious, works, aquinas, conceives, of, merit, in, the, augustinian, sense, god, gives, the, reward, for, that, toward, which, he, himself, gives, the, power, man, can, never, of, himself, deserve, the, prima, gratis, nor, meritum, de, congruo, by, natural, ability, cf, r, seeberg, lehrbuch, der, dogmengeschichte, ii, 105, 106, leipsic, 1898, after, thus, stating, the, principles, of, morality, in, the, secunda, secundae, st, thomas, comes, to, a, minute, exposition, of, his, ethics, according, to, the, scheme, of, the, virtues, the, conceptions, of, faith, and, love, are, of, much, significance, in, the, complete, system, of, st, thomas, man, strives, toward, the, highest, good, with, the, will, or, through, love, but, since, the, end, must, first, be, apprehended, in, the, intellect, knowledge, of, the, end, to, be, loved, must, precede, love, because, the, will, can, not, strive, after, god, in, perfect, love, unless, the, intellect, have, true, faith, toward, him, inasmuch, as, this, truth, that, is, to, be, known, is, practical, it, first, incites, the, will, which, then, brings, the, reason, to, assent, but, since, furthermore, the, good, in, question, is, transcendent, and, inaccessible, to, man, by, himself, it, requires, the, infusion, of, a, supernatural, capacity, or, disposition, to, make, man, capable, of, faith, as, well, as, love, accordingly, the, object, of, both, faith, and, love, is, god, involving, also, the, entire, complex, of, truths, and, commandments, that, god, reveals, insofar, as, they, in, fact, relate, to, god, and, lead, to, him, thus, faith, becomes, recognition, of, the, teachings, and, precepts, of, the, scriptures, and, the, church, the, first, subjection, of, man, to, god, is, by, faith, the, object, of, faith, is, by, its, nature, object, of, love, therefore, faith, comes, to, completion, only, in, love, by, love, is, the, act, of, faith, accomplished, and, formed, law, is, nothing, else, than, an, ordinance, of, reason, for, the, common, good, made, by, him, who, has, care, of, the, community, and, promulgated, all, law, comes, from, the, eternal, law, of, divine, reason, that, governs, the, universe, which, is, understood, and, participated, in, by, rational, beings, such, as, men, and, angels, as, the, natural, law, the, natural, law, when, codified, and, promulgated, is, lex, humana, human, law, in, addition, to, the, human, law, dictated, by, reason, man, also, has, the, divine, law, which, according, to, question, 91, is, dictated, through, revelation, that, man, may, be, directed, how, to, perform, his, proper, acts, in, view, of, his, last, end, that, man, may, know, without, any, doubt, what, he, ought, to, do, and, what, he, ought, to, avoid, because, human, law, could, not, sufficiently, curb, and, direct, interior, acts, and, since, human, law, cannot, punish, or, forbid, all, evil, deeds, since, while, aiming, at, doing, away, with, all, evils, it, would, do, away, with, many, good, things, and, would, hinder, the, advance, of, the, common, good, which, is, necessary, for, human, intercourse, human, law, is, not, all, powerful, it, cannot, govern, a, man, s, conscience, nor, prohibit, all, vices, nor, can, it, force, all, men, to, act, according, to, its, letter, rather, than, its, spirit, furthermore, it, is, possible, that, an, edict, can, be, issued, without, any, basis, in, law, as, defined, in, question, 90, in, this, case, men, are, under, no, compulsion, to, act, save, as, it, helps, the, common, good, this, separation, between, law, and, acts, of, force, also, allows, men, to, depose, tyrants, or, those, who, flout, the, natural, law, while, removing, an, agent, of, the, law, is, contrary, to, the, common, good, and, the, eternal, law, of, god, which, orders, the, powers, that, be, removing, a, tyrant, is, lawful, as, he, has, ceded, his, claim, to, being, a, lawful, authority, by, acting, contrary, to, law, the, way, which, leads, to, god, is, christ, the, theme, of, part, iii, it, can, be, asserted, that, the, incarnation, was, absolutely, necessary, the, unio, between, the, logos, and, the, human, nature, is, a, relation, between, the, divine, and, the, human, nature, which, comes, about, by, both, natures, being, brought, together, in, the, one, person, of, the, logos, an, incarnation, can, be, spoken, of, only, in, the, sense, that, the, human, nature, began, to, be, in, the, eternal, hypostasis, of, the, divine, nature, so, christ, is, unum, since, his, human, nature, lacks, the, hypostasis, the, person, of, the, logos, accordingly, has, assumed, the, impersonal, human, nature, and, in, such, way, that, the, assumption, of, the, soul, became, the, means, for, the, assumption, of, the, body, this, union, with, the, human, soul, is, the, gratia, unionis, which, leads, to, the, impartation, of, the, gratia, habitualis, from, the, logos, to, the, human, nature, thereby, all, human, potentialities, are, made, perfect, in, jesus, besides, the, perfections, given, by, the, vision, of, god, which, jesus, enjoyed, from, the, beginning, he, receives, all, others, by, the, gratia, habitualis, insofar, as, it, is, the, limited, human, nature, which, receives, these, perfections, they, are, finite, this, holds, both, of, the, knowledge, and, the, will, of, christ, the, logos, impresses, the, species, intelligibiles, of, all, created, things, on, the, soul, but, the, intellectus, agens, transforms, them, gradually, into, the, impressions, of, sense, on, another, side, the, soul, of, christ, works, miracles, only, as, instrument, of, the, logos, since, omnipotence, in, no, way, appertains, to, this, human, soul, in, itself, concerning, redemption, st, thomas, teaches, that, christ, is, to, be, regarded, as, redeemer, after, his, human, nature, but, in, such, way, that, the, human, nature, produces, divine, effects, as, organ, of, divinity, the, one, side, of, the, work, of, redemption, consists, herein, that, christ, as, head, of, humanity, imparts, ordo, perfectio, and, virtus, to, his, members, he, is, the, teacher, and, example, of, humanity, his, whole, life, and, suffering, as, well, as, his, work, after, he, is, exalted, serve, this, end, the, love, wrought, hereby, in, men, effects, according, to, luke, vii, 47, the, forgiveness, of, sins, this, is, the, first, course, of, thought, then, follows, a, second, complex, of, thoughts, which, has, the, idea, of, satisfaction, as, its, center, to, be, sure, god, as, the, highest, being, could, forgive, sins, without, satisfaction, but, because, his, justice, and, mercy, could, be, best, revealed, through, satisfaction, he, chose, this, way, as, little, as, satisfaction, is, necessary, in, itself, so, little, does, it, offer, an, equivalent, in, a, correct, sense, for, guilt, it, is, rather, a, superabundant, satisfaction, since, on, account, of, the, divine, subject, in, christ, in, a, certain, sense, his, suffering, and, activity, are, infinite, with, this, thought, the, strict, logical, deduction, of, anselm, s, theory, is, given, up, christ, s, suffering, bore, personal, character, in, that, it, proceeded, out, of, love, and, obedience, it, was, an, offering, brought, to, god, which, as, a, personal, act, had, the, character, of, merit, thereby, christ, merited, salvation, for, men, as, christ, exalted, still, influences, men, so, does, he, still, work, on, their, behalf, continually, in, heaven, through, the, intercession, interpellatio, in, this, way, christ, as, head, of, humanity, effects, the, forgiveness, of, their, sins, their, reconciliation, with, god, their, immunity, from, punishment, deliverance, from, the, devil, and, the, opening, of, heaven, s, gate, but, inasmuch, as, all, these, benefits, are, already, offered, through, the, inner, operation, of, the, love, of, christ, aquinas, has, combined, the, theories, of, anselm, and, abelard, by, joining, the, one, to, the, other, the, doctrine, of, the, sacraments, follows, the, christology, the, sacraments, have, efficacy, from, the, incarnate, word, himself, they, are, not, only, signs, of, sanctification, but, also, bring, it, about, it, is, inevitable, that, they, bring, spiritual, gifts, in, sensuous, form, because, of, the, sensuous, nature, of, man, the, res, sensibiles, are, the, matter, the, words, of, institution, the, form, of, the, sacraments, contrary, to, the, franciscan, view, that, the, sacraments, are, mere, symbols, whose, efficacy, god, accompanies, with, a, directly, following, creative, act, in, the, soul, st, thomas, holds, it, not, unfit, to, agree, with, hugo, of, st, victor, that, a, sacrament, contains, grace, or, to, teach, that, they, cause, grace, st, thomas, attempts, to, remove, the, difficulty, of, a, sensuous, thing, producing, a, creative, effect, by, distinguishing, between, the, causa, principalis, et, instrumentalis, god, as, the, principal, cause, works, through, the, sensuous, thing, as, the, means, ordained, by, him, for, his, end, just, as, instrumental, power, is, acquired, by, the, instrument, from, this, that, it, is, moved, by, the, principal, agent, so, also, the, sacrament, obtains, spiritual, power, from, the, benediction, of, christ, and, the, application, of, the, minister, to, the, use, of, the, sacrament, there, is, spiritual, power, in, the, sacraments, in, so, far, as, they, have, been, ordained, by, god, for, a, spiritual, effect, this, spiritual, power, remains, in, the, sensuous, thing, until, it, has, attained, its, purpose, at, the, same, time, st, thomas, distinguished, the, gratia, sacramentalis, from, the, gratia, virtutum, et, donorum, in, that, the, former, perfects, the, general, essence, and, the, powers, of, the, soul, whilst, the, latter, in, particular, brings, to, pass, necessary, spiritual, effects, for, the, christian, life, later, this, distinction, was, ignored, in, a, single, statement, the, effect, of, the, sacraments, is, to, infuse, justifying, grace, into, men, that, which, christ, effects, is, achieved, through, the, sacraments, christ, s, humanity, was, the, instrument, for, the, operation, of, his, divinity, the, sacraments, are, the, instruments, through, which, this, operation, of, christ, s, humanity, passes, over, to, men, christ, s, humanity, served, his, divinity, as, instrumentum, conjunctum, like, the, hand, the, sacraments, are, instrumenta, separata, like, a, staff, the, former, can, use, the, latter, as, the, hand, can, use, a, staff, for, a, more, detailed, exposition, cf, seeberg, ut, sup, ii, 112, sqq, of, st, thomas, s, eschatology, according, to, the, commentary, on, the, sentences, this, is, only, a, brief, account, everlasting, blessedness, consists, in, the, vision, of, god, this, vision, consists, not, in, an, abstraction, or, in, a, mental, image, supernaturally, produced, but, the, divine, substance, itself, is, beheld, and, in, such, manner, that, god, himself, becomes, immediately, the, form, of, the, beholding, intellect, god, is, the, object, of, the, vision, and, at, the, same, time, causes, the, vision, the, perfection, of, the, blessed, also, demands, that, the, body, be, restored, to, the, soul, as, something, to, be, made, perfect, by, it, since, blessedness, consists, in, operatio, it, is, made, more, perfect, in, that, the, soul, has, a, definite, operatio, with, the, body, although, the, peculiar, act, of, blessedness, in, other, words, the, vision, of, god, has, nothing, to, do, with, the, body, john, xxii, died, 1334, the, pope, who, canonized, aquinas, said, in, latin, about, his, summa, theologiae, quot, articula, tot,
