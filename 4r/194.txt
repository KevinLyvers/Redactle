that, the, tone, of, mind, and, thought, which, has, overthrown, authority, and, violated, every, code, human, and, divine, abroad, and, fostered, chartism, and, rebellion, at, home, is, the, same, which, has, also, written, jane, eyre, an, anonymous, review, in, the, mirror, of, literature, amusement, and, instruction, writes, of, the, extraordinary, daring, of, the, writer, of, jane, eyre, however, the, review, is, mostly, critical, summarising, there, is, not, a, single, natural, character, throughout, the, work, everybody, moves, on, stilts, the, opinions, are, bad, the, notions, absurd, religion, is, stabbed, in, the, dark, our, social, distinctions, attempted, to, be, levelled, and, all, absurdly, moral, notions, done, away, with, there, were, some, who, felt, more, positive, about, the, novel, contemporaneously, george, henry, lewes, said, it, reads, like, a, page, out, of, one, s, own, life, and, so, do, many, other, pages, in, the, book, another, critic, from, the, atlas, wrote, it, is, full, of, youthful, vigour, of, freshness, and, originality, of, nervous, diction, and, concentrated, interest, it, is, a, book, to, make, the, pulses, gallop, and, the, heart, beat, and, to, fill, the, eyes, with, tears, a, review, in, the, era, praised, the, novel, calling, it, an, extraordinary, book, observing, that, there, is, much, to, ponder, over, rejoice, over, and, weep, over, in, its, ably, written, pages, much, of, the, heart, laid, bare, and, the, mind, explored, much, of, greatness, in, affliction, and, littleness, in, the, ascendant, much, of, trial, and, temptation, of, fortitude, and, resignation, of, sound, sense, and, christianity, but, no, tameness, the, people, s, journal, compliments, the, novel, s, vigour, stating, that, the, reader, never, tires, never, sleeps, the, swell, and, tide, of, an, affluent, existence, an, irresistible, energy, bears, him, onward, from, first, to, last, it, is, impossible, to, deny, that, the, author, possesses, native, power, in, an, uncommon, degree, showing, itself, now, in, rapid, headlong, recital, now, in, stern, fierce, daring, dashes, in, portraiture, anon, in, subtle, startling,

against, accusations, of, immorality, describing, it, as, a, work, which, has, produced, a, decided, sensation, in, this, country, and, in, england, jane, eyre, has, made, its, mark, upon, the, age, and, even, palsied, the, talons, of, mercenary, criticism, yes, critics, hired, to, abuse, or, panegyrize, at, so, much, per, line, have, felt, a, throb, of, human, feeling, pervade, their, veins, at, the, perusal, of, jane, eyre, this, is, extraordinary, almost, preternatural, smacking, strongly, of, the, miraculous, and, yet, it, is, true, we, have, seen, jane, eyre, put, down, as, a, work, of, gross, immorality, and, its, author, described, as, the, very, incarnation, of, sensualism, to, any, one, who, has, read, the, work, this, may, look, ridiculous, and, yet, it, is, true, the, indicator, concerning, speculation, regarding, the, gender, of, the, author, wrote, we, doubt, not, it, will, soon, cease, to, be, a, secret, but, on, one, assertion, we, are, willing, to, risk, our, critical, reputation, and, that, is, that, no, woman, wrote, it, this, was, our, decided, conviction, at, the, first, perusal, and, a, somewhat, careful, study, of, the, work, has, strengthened, it, no, woman, in, all, the, annals, of, feminine, celebrity, ever, wrote, such, a, style, terse, yet, eloquent, and, filled, with, energy, bordering, sometimes, almost, on, rudeness, no, woman, ever, conceived, such, masculine, characters, as, those, portrayed, here, literary, critic, jerome, beaty, believed, the, close, first, person, perspective, leaves, the, reader, too, uncritically, accepting, of, her, worldview, and, often, leads, reading, and, conversation, about, the, novel, towards, supporting, jane, regardless, of, how, irregular, her, ideas, or, perspectives, are, in, 2003,

throughout, the, novel, there, are, frequent, themes, relating, to, ideas, of, ethnicity, specifically, that, of, bertha, which, are, a, reflection, of, the, society, that, the, novel, is, set, within, mr, rochester, claims, to, have, been, forced, to, take, on, a, mad, creole, wife, a, woman, who, grew, up, in, the, west, indies, and, who, is, thought, to, be, of, mixed, race, descent, in, the, analysis, of, several, scholars, bertha, plays, the, role, of, the, racialised, other, through, the, shared, belief, that, she, chose, to, follow, in, the, footsteps, of, her, parents, her, alcoholism, and, apparent, mental, instability, cast, her, as, someone, who, is, incapable, of, restraining, herself, almost, forced, to, submit, to, the, different, vices, she, is, a, victim, of, many, writers, of, the, period, believed, that, one, could, develop, mental, instability, or, mental, illnesses, simply, based, on, their, race, this, means, that, those, who, were, born, of, ethnicities, associated, with, a, darker, complexion, or, those, who, were, not, fully, of, european, descent, were, believed, to, be, more, mentally, unstable, than, their, white, european, counterparts, were, according, to, american, scholar, susan, meyer, in, writing, jane, eyre, bront, was, responding, to, the, seemingly, inevitable, analogy, in, 19th, century, european, texts, which, white, women, with, blacks, in, order, to, degrade, both, groups, and, assert, the, need, for, white, male, control, bertha, serves, as, an, example, of, both, the, multiracial, population, and, of, a, clean, european, as, she, is, seemingly, able, to, pass, as, a, white, woman, for, the, most, part, but, also, is, hinted, towards, being, of, an, impure, race, since, she, does, not, come, from, a, purely, white, or, european, lineage, the, title, that, she, is, given, by, others, of, being, a, creole, woman, leaves, her, a, stranger, where, she, is, not, black, but, is, also, not, considered, to, be, white, enough, to, fit, into, higher, society, unlike, bertha, jane, eyre, is, thought, of, as, being, sound, of, mind, before, the, reader, is, able, to, fully, understand, the, character, simply, because, she, is, described, as, having, a, complexion, that, is, pale, and, she, has, grown, up, in, a, european, society, rather, than, in, an, animalistic, setting, like, bertha, jane, is, favoured, heavily, from, the, start, of, her, interactions, with, rochester, simply, because, like, rochester, himself, she, is, deemed, to, be, of, a, superior, ethnic, group, than, that, of, his, first, wife, while, she, still, experiences, some, forms, of, repression, throughout, her, life, the, events, of, the, lowood, institution, none, of, them, are, as, heavily, taxing, on, her, as, that, which, is, experienced, by, bertha, both, women, go, through, acts, of, suppression, on, behalf, of, the, men, in, their, lives, yet, jane, is, looked, at, with, favour, because, of, her, supposed, beauty, that, can, be, found, in, the, colour, of, her, skin, while, both, are, characterised, as, falling, outside, of, the, normal, feminine, standards, of, this, time, jane, is, thought, of, as, superior, to, bertha, because, she, demands, respect, and, is, able, to, use, her, talents, as, a, governess, whereas, bertha, is, seen, as, a, creature, to, be, confined, in, the, attic, away, from, polite, society, scholars, have, also, noted, the, novel, s, overt, references, and, allusions, to, slavery, arguably, its, north, american, iteration, jean, rhys, intended, her,

1967, rhys, explores, themes, of, dominance, and, dependence, especially, in, marriage, depicting, the, mutually, painful, relationship, between, a, privileged, english, man, and, a, creole, woman, from, dominica, made, powerless, on, being, duped, and, coerced, by, him, and, others, both, the, man, and, the, woman, enter, marriage, under, mistaken, assumptions, about, the, other, partner, her, female, lead, marries, mr, rochester, and, deteriorates, in, england, as, the, madwoman, in, the, attic, rhys, portrays, this, woman, from, a, quite, different, perspective, from, the, one, in, jane, eyre, the, idea, of, the, equality, of, men, and, women, emerged, more, strongly, in, the, victorian, period, in, britain, after, works, by, earlier, writers, such, as, mary, wollstonecraft, r, b, martin, described, jane, eyre, as, the, first, major, feminist, novel, although, there, is, not, a, hint, in, the, book, of, any, desire, for, political, legal, educational, or, even, intellectual, equality, between, the, sexes, this, is, illustrated, in, chapter, 23, when, jane, responds, to, rochester, s, callous, and, indirect, proposal, do, you, think, i, am, an, automaton, a, machine,

varying, situations, as, a, child, she, mixes, with, middle, class, people, through, the, reed, family, though, jane, is, not, at, the, same, level, of, social, class, as, the, rest, of, the, reed, family, while, at, lowood, she, experiences, the, life, of, children, whose, guardians, can, afford, the, school, fees, of, fifteen, pounds, per, year, but, nonetheless, are, charity, children,
