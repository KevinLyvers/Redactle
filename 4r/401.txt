as, country, music, while, rock, and, roll, s, formative, elements, can, be, heard, in, blues, records, from, the, 1920s, and, in, country, records, of, the, 1930s, the, genre, did, not, acquire, its,

became, internationally, known, for, promoting, african, american, rhythm, and, blues, music, on, the, radio, in, the, united, states, and, europe, under, the, name, of, rock, and, roll, not, often, acknowledged, in, the, history, of, rock, and, roll, todd, storz, the, owner, of, radio, station, kowh, in, omaha, nebraska, was, the, first, to, adopt, the, top, 40, format, in, 1953, playing, only, the, most, popular, records, in, rotation, his, station, and, the, numerous, others, which, adopted, the, concept, helped, to, promote, the, genre, by, the, mid, 50s, the, playlist, included, artists, such, as, presley, lewis, haley, berry, and, domino, the, origins, of, rock, and, roll, have, been, fiercely, debated, by, commentators, and, historians, of, music, there, is, general, agreement, that, it, arose, in, the, southern, united, states, a, region, that, would, produce, most, of, the, major, early, rock, and, roll, acts, through, the, meeting, of, various, influences, that, embodied, a, merging, of, the, african, musical, tradition, with, european, instrumentation, the, migration, of, many, former, slaves, and, their, descendants, to, major, urban, centers, such, as, st, louis, memphis, new, york, city, detroit, chicago, cleveland, and, buffalo, meant, that, black, and, white, residents, were, living, in, close, proximity, in, larger, numbers, than, ever, before, and, as, a, result, heard, each, other, s, music, and, even, began, to, emulate, each, other, s, fashions, radio, stations, that, made, white, and, black, forms, of, music, available, to, both, groups, the, development, and, spread, of, the, gramophone, record, and, african, american, musical, styles, such, as, jazz, and, swing, which, were, taken, up, by, white, musicians, aided, this, process, of, cultural, collision, the, immediate, roots, of, rock, and, roll, lay, in, the, rhythm, and, blues, then, called, race, music, in, combination, with, either, boogie, woogie, and, shouting, gospel, or, with, country, music, of, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, particularly, significant, influences, were, jazz, blues, gospel, country, and, folk, commentators, differ, in, their, views, of, which, of, these, forms, were, most, important, and, the, degree, to, which, the, new, music, was, a, re, branding, of, african, american, rhythm, and, blues, for, a, white, market, or, a, new, hybrid, of, black, and, white, forms, contradicting, larry, birnbaum, the, author, of, before, elvis, the, prehistory, of, rock, n, roll, and, notwithstanding, early, forms, of, white, rock, and, roll, then, called, country, boogie, musicologist, and, rock, historian, bruno, blum, argues, that, early, fully, formed, rock, and, roll, music, really, surged, in, america, at, least, as, early, as, 1945, but, was, segregated, thus, making, it, unavailable, to, the, general, public, and, widely, undocumented, according, to, blum, true, rock, tracks, from, the, 1940s, included, rock, woogie, by, jim, wynn, s, bobalibans, 1945, rockin, the, house, by, memphis, slim, and, the, house, rockers, 1946, aladdin, boogie, by, amos, milburn, 1947, rock, and, rye, by, jimmy, mccracklin, 1947, we, re, gonna, rock, 1947, and, rock, and, roll, 1948, by, wild, bill, moore, and, many, others, his, discussion, of, the, topic, is, as, follows, for, most, lovers, of, the, genre, rock, sprang, up, with, bill, haley, and, elvis, presley, in, 1954, 1956, but, why, would, rock, be, called, rock, when, played, by, whites, and, rhythm, and, blues, when, it, was, played, by, blacks, according, to, the, usual, clich, s, rock, s, roots, lie, deep, in, a, muddled, amalgam, where, blues, and, rhythm, and, blues, were, necessarily, mixed, with, country, music, in, order, to, be, dubbed, rock, and, thereby, gain, entrance, to, history, and, legend, the, official, history, that, is, yet, african, american, rock, anticipated, bill, haley, s, first, isolated, hit, rock, the, joint, 1952, by, a, long, way, as, shown, by, its, rare, original, version, by, jimmy, preston, in, 1948, included, here, this, black, rock, would, discreetly, coexist, with, the, first, white, rock, hits, but, there, is, still, a, clear, tendency, to, relegate, african, american, rock, to, the, genre, s, prehistory, which, would, be, to, say, that, it, is, not, part, of, the, genre, consequently, and, despite, their, landmark, recordings, tiny, bradshaw, wynonie, harris, roy, brown, smiley, lewis, and, others, have, been, literally, erased, from, our, memories, leaving, the, official, title, of, pioneers, to, the, subsequent, generation, eddie, cochran, elvis, and, their, like, even, though, they, appeared, only, five, or, ten, years, later, two, black, artists, still, appear, amongst, the, official, inventors, of, rock, however, the, undisputed, giants, named, little, richard, and, chuck, berry, who, had, both, started, singing, and, playing, in, the, very, early, 1950s, but, african, american, hits, like, saturday, night, fish, fry, by, louis, jordan, with, its, electric, guitar, and, it, was, rocking, chorus, in, 1949, would, still, be, seen, as, something, like, the, work, of, prehistoric, men, who, were, ineligible, for, the, rock, hall, of, fame, if, you, admit, that, the, contribution, of, euro, american, music, not, forgetting, hawaiian, music, along, with, bluegrass, irish, popular, songs, cajun, music, and, others, did, much, to, enrich, the, history, of, white, rock, and, rockabilly, in, particular, and, while, the, interaction, between, black, and, white, musicians, was, often, the, norm, including, in, the, blues, domain, the, fact, remains, that, the, fundamental, matrix, of, the, rock, genre, is, african, american, when, they, added, country, guitars, it, was, rockabilly, that, bill, haley, sam, phillips, and, his, creature, elvis, presley, invented, in, 1951, 1954, not, rock, which, was, something, they, tried, to, assimilate, by, recording, versions, of, black, pieces, like, rocket, 88, by, jackie, brenston, or, good, rockin, tonight, by, roy, brown, whose, original, version, had, appeared, in, 1947, depending, on, the, dj, tempo, rhythm, and, style, of, the, period, the, era, s, names, for, this, music, were, jazz, we, love, to, boogie, by, freddy, strong, with, dizzy, gillespie, and, john, coltrane, swing, it, rocks, it, rolls, it, swings, by, the, treniers, or, boogie, woogie, rock, woogie, by, jim, wynn, in, 1945, like, boogie, shuffle, music, had, arrived, as, early, as, the, late, thirties, rock, this, morning, by, james, allen, james, gilchrist, the, music, was, also, called, blues, my, baby, left, me, by, arthur, crudup, rhythm, music, hambone, by, red, saunders, rhythm, and, blues, honey, hush, by, big, joe, turner, r, b, the, abbreviation, of, rhythm, and, blues, and, the, name, given, to, black, music, styles, in, the, charts, of, billboard, magazine, post, summer, 1949, jump, blues, rock, around, the, clock, by, hal, singer, big, beat, rock, n, roll, or, race, music, was, the, label, used, by, the, press, and, billboard, in, particular, in, the, 1930s, jazz, and, particularly, swing, both, in, urban, based, dance, bands, and, blues, influenced, country, swing, jimmie, rodgers, moon, mullican, and, other, similar, singers, were, among, the, first, music, to, present, african, american, sounds, for, a, predominantly, white, audience, one, particularly, noteworthy, example, of, a, jazz, song, with, recognizably, rock, and, roll, elements, is, big, joe, turner, with, pianist, pete, johnson, s, 1938, single, roll, em, pete, which, is, regarded, as, an, important, precursor, of, rock, and, roll, the, 1940s, saw, the, increased, use, of, blaring, horns, including, saxophones, shouted, lyrics, and, boogie, woogie, beats, in, jazz, based, music, during, and, immediately, after, world, war, ii, with, shortages, of, fuel, and, limitations, on, audiences, and, available, personnel, large, jazz, bands, were, less, economical, and, tended, to, be, replaced, by, smaller, combos, using, guitars, bass, and, drums, in, the, same, period, particularly, on, the, west, coast, and, in, the, midwest, the, development, of, jump, blues, with, its, guitar, riffs, prominent, beats, and, shouted, lyrics, prefigured, many, later, developments, in, the, documentary, film, hail, hail, rock, n, roll, keith, richards, proposes, that, chuck, berry, developed, his, brand, of, rock, and, roll, by, transposing, the, familiar, two, note, lead, line, of, jump, blues, piano, directly, to, the, electric, guitar, creating, what, is, instantly, recognizable, as, rock, guitar, this, proposal, by, richards, neglects, the, black, guitarists, who, did, the, same, thing, before, berry, such, as, goree, carter, gatemouth, brown, and, the, originator, of, the, style, t, bone, walker, country, boogie, and, chicago, electric, blues, supplied, many, of, the, elements, that, would, be, seen, as, characteristic, of, rock, and, roll, inspired, by, electric, blues, chuck, berry, introduced, an, aggressive, guitar, sound, to, rock, and, roll, and, established, the, electric, guitar, as, its, centerpiece, adapting, his, rock, band, instrumentation, from, the, basic, blues, band, instrumentation, of, a, lead, guitar, second, chord, instrument, bass, and, drums, in, 2017, robert, christgau, declared, that, chuck, berry, did, in, fact, invent, rock, n, roll, explaining, that, this, artist, came, the, closest, of, any, single, figure, to, being, the, one, who, put, all, the, essential, pieces, together, rock, and, roll, arrived, at, a, time, of, considerable, technological, change, soon, after, the, development, of, the, electric, guitar, amplifier, 45, rpm, record, and, modern, condenser, microphones, there, were, also, changes, in, the, record, industry, with, the, rise, of, independent, labels, like, atlantic, sun, and, chess, servicing, niche, audiences, and, a, similar, rise, of, radio, stations, that, played, their, music, it, was, the, realization, that, relatively, affluent, white, teenagers, were, listening, to, this, music, that, led, to, the, development, of, what, was, to, be, defined, as, rock, and, roll, as, a, distinct, genre, because, the, development, of, rock, and, roll, was, an, evolutionary, process, no, single, record, can, be, identified, as, unambiguously, the, first, rock, and, roll, record, contenders, for, the, title, of, first, rock, and, roll, record, include, sister, rosetta, tharpe, s, strange, things, happening, every, day, 1944, that, s, all, right, by, arthur, crudup, 1946, move, it, on, over, by, hank, williams, 1947, the, fat, man, by, fats, domino, 1949, goree, carter, s, rock, awhile, 1949, and, jimmy, preston, s, rock, the, joint, 1949, later, covered, by, bill, haley, his, comets, in, 1952, rocket, 88, by, jackie, brenston, and, his, delta, cats, ike, turner, and, his, band, the, kings, of, rhythm, and, sung, by, brenston, was, recorded, by, sam, phillips, in, march, 1951, this, is, often, cited, as, the, first, rock, n, roll, record, in, an, interview, however, ike, turner, offered, this, comment, i, don, t, think, that, rocket, 88, is, rock, n, roll, i, think, that, rocket, 88, is, r, b, but, i, think, rocket, 88, is, the, cause, of, rock, and, roll, existing, in, terms, of, its, wide, cultural, impact, across, society, in, the, us, and, elsewhere, bill, haley, s, rock, around, the, clock, recorded, in, april, 1954, but, not, a, commercial, success, until, the, following, year, is, generally, recognized, as, an, important, milestone, but, it, was, preceded, by, many, recordings, from, earlier, decades, in, which, elements, of, rock, and, roll, can, be, clearly, discerned, journalist, alexis, petridis, argued, that, neither, haley, s, rock, around, the, clock, nor, presley, s, version, of, that, s, alright, mama, heralded, a, new, genre, they, were, simply, the, first, white, artists, interpretations, of, a, sound, already, well, established, by, black, musicians, almost, a, decade, before, it, was, a, raucous, driving, unnamed, variant, of, rhythm, and, blues, that, came, complete, with, lyrics, that, talked, about, rocking, other, artists, with, early, rock, and, roll, hits, included, chuck, berry, bo, diddley, little, richard, jerry, lee, lewis, and, gene, vincent, chuck, berry, s, 1955, classic, maybellene, in, particular, features, a, distorted, electric, guitar, solo, with, warm, overtones, created, by, his, small, valve, amplifier, however, the, use, of, distortion, was, predated, by, electric, blues, guitarists, such, as, joe, hill, louis, guitar, slim, willie, johnson, of, howlin, wolf, s, band, and, pat, hare, the, latter, two, also, made, use, of, distorted, power, chords, in, the, early, 1950s, also, in, 1955, bo, diddley, introduced, the, bo, diddley, beat, and, a, unique, electric, guitar, style, influenced, by, african, and, afro, cuban, music, and, in, turn, influencing, many, later, artists, rock, and, roll, was, strongly, influenced, by, r, b, according, to, many, sources, including, an, article, in, the, wall, street, journal, in, 1985, titled, rock, it, s, still, rhythm, and, blues, in, fact, the, author, stated, that, the, two, terms, were, used, interchangeably, until, about, 1957, the, other, sources, quoted, in, the, article, said, that, rock, and, roll, combined, r, b, with, pop, and, country, music, fats, domino, was, one, of, the, biggest, stars, of, rock, and, roll, in, the, early, 1950s, and, he, was, not, convinced, that, this, was, a, new, genre, in, 1957, he, said, what, they, call, rock, n, roll, now, is, rhythm, and, blues, i, ve, been, playing, it, for, 15, years, in, new, orleans, according, to, rolling, stone, this, is, a, valid, statement, all, fifties, rockers, black, and, white, country, born, and, city, bred, were, fundamentally, influenced, by, r, b, the, black, popular, music, of, the, late, forties, and, early, fifties, further, little, richard, built, his, ground, breaking, sound, of, the, same, era, with, an, uptempo, blend, of, boogie, woogie, new, orleans, rhythm, and, blues, and, the, soul, and, fervor, of, gospel, music, vocalization, less, frequently, cited, as, an, influencer, lavern, baker, was, inducted, into, the, rock, and, roll, hall, of, fame, in, 1991, the, hall, remarked, that, her, fiery, fusion, of, blues, jazz, and, r, b, showcased, her, alluring, vocals, and, set, the, stage, for, the, rock, and, roll, surge, of, the, fifties, rockabilly, usually, but, not, exclusively, refers, to, the, type, of, rock, and, roll, music, which, was, played, and, recorded, in, the, mid, 1950s, primarily, by, white, singers, such, as, elvis, presley, carl, perkins, johnny, cash, and, jerry, lee, lewis, who, drew, mainly, on, the, country, roots, of, the, music, presley, was, greatly, influenced, by, and, incorporated, his, style, of, music, with, that, of, some, of, the, greatest, black, musicians, like, bb, king, arthur, crudup, and, fats, domino, his, style, of, music, combined, with, black, influences, created, controversy, during, a, turbulent, time, in, history, many, other, popular, rock, and, roll, singers, of, the, time, such, as, fats, domino, and, little, richard, came, out, of, the, black, rhythm, and, blues, tradition, making, the, music, attractive, to, white, audiences, and, are, not, usually, classed, as, rockabilly, presley, popularized, rock, and, roll, on, a, wider, scale, than, any, other, single, performer, and, by, 1956, he, had, emerged, as, the, singing, sensation, of, the, nation, bill, flagg, who, is, a, connecticut, resident, began, referring, to, his, mix, of, hillbilly, and, rock, n, roll, music, as, rockabilly, around, 1953, in, july, 1954, presley, recorded, the, regional, hit, that, s, all, right, at, sam, phillips, sun, studio, in, memphis, three, months, earlier, on, april, 12, 1954, bill, haley, his, comets, recorded, rock, around, the, clock, although, only, a, minor, hit, when, first, released, when, used, in, the, opening, sequence, of, the, movie, blackboard, jungle, a, year, later, it, set, the, rock, and, roll, boom, in, motion, the, song, became, one, of, the, biggest, hits, in, history, and, frenzied, teens, flocked, to, see, haley, and, the, comets, perform, it, causing, riots, in, some, cities, rock, around, the, clock, was, a, breakthrough, success, for, the, group, traditionally, the, song, has, been, seen, as, the, major, breakthrough, for, the, rock, and, roll, genre, as, its, immense, popularity, introduced, the, music, to, a, global, audience, in, 1956, the, arrival, of, rockabilly, was, underlined, by, the, success, of, songs, like, folsom, prison, blues, by, johnny, cash, blue, suede, shoes, by, perkins, and, the, no, 1, hit, heartbreak, hotel, by, presley, for, a, few, years, it, became, the, most, commercially, successful, form, of, rock, and, roll, later, rockabilly, acts, particularly, performing, songwriters, like, buddy, holly, would, be, a, major, influence, on, british, invasion, acts, and, particularly, on, the, song, writing, of, the, beatles, and, through, them, on, the, nature, of, later, rock, music, many, of, the, earliest, white, rock, and, roll, hits, were, covers, or, partial, re, writes, of, earlier, black, rhythm, and, blues, or, blues, songs, through, the, late, 1940s, and, early, 1950s, r, b, music, had, been, gaining, a, stronger, beat, and, a, wilder, style, with, artists, such, as, fats, domino, and, johnny, otis, speeding, up, the, tempos, and, increasing, the, backbeat, to, great, popularity, on, the, juke, joint, circuit, before, the, efforts, of, freed, and, others, black, music, was, taboo, on, many, white, owned, radio, outlets, but, artists, and, producers, quickly, recognized, the, potential, of, rock, and, roll, some, of, presley, s, early, recordings, were, covers, of, black, rhythm, and, blues, or, blues, songs, such, as, that, s, all, right, a, countrified, arrangement, of, a, blues, number, baby, let, s, play, house, lawdy, miss, clawdy, and, hound, dog, the, racial, lines, however, are, rather, more, clouded, by, the, fact, that, some, of, these, r, b, songs, originally, recorded, by, black, artists, had, been, written, by, white, songwriters, such, as, the, team, of, jerry, leiber, and, mike, stoller, songwriting, credits, were, often, unreliable, many, publishers, record, executives, and, even, managers, both, white, and, black, would, insert, their, name, as, a, composer, in, order, to, collect, royalty, checks, covers, were, customary, in, the, music, industry, at, the, time, it, was, made, particularly, easy, by, the, compulsory, license, provision, of, united, states, copyright, law, still, in, effect, one, of, the, first, relevant, successful, covers, was, wynonie, harris, s, transformation, of, roy, brown, s, 1947, original, jump, blues, hit, good, rocking, tonight, into, a, more, showy, rocker, and, the, louis, prima, rocker, oh, babe, in, 1950, as, well, as, amos, milburn, s, cover, of, what, may, have, been, the, first, white, rock, and, roll, record, hardrock, gunter, s, birmingham, bounce, in, 1949, the, most, notable, trend, however, was, white, pop, covers, of, black, r, b, numbers, the, more, familiar, sound, of, these, covers, may, have, been, more, palatable, to, white, audiences, there, may, have, been, an, element, of, prejudice, but, labels, aimed, at, the, white, market, also, had, much, better, distribution, networks, and, were, generally, much, more, profitable, famously, pat, boone, recorded, sanitized, versions, of, songs, recorded, by, the, likes, of, fats, domino, little, richard, the, flamingos, and, ivory, joe, hunter, later, as, those, songs, became, popular, the, original, artists, recordings, received, radio, play, as, well, the, cover, versions, were, not, necessarily, straightforward, imitations, for, example, bill, haley, s, incompletely, bowdlerized, cover, of, shake, rattle, and, roll, transformed, big, joe, turner, s, humorous, and, racy, tale, of, adult, love, into, an, energetic, teen, dance, number, while, georgia, gibbs, replaced, etta, james, tough, sarcastic, vocal, in, roll, with, me, henry, covered, as, dance, with, me, henry, with, a, perkier, vocal, more, appropriate, for, an, audience, unfamiliar, with, the, song, to, which, james, s, song, was, an, answer, hank, ballard, s, work, with, me, annie, presley, s, rock, and, roll, version, of, hound, dog, taken, mainly, from, a, version, recorded, by, the, pop, band, freddie, bell, and, the, bellboys, was, very, different, from, the, blues, shouter, that, big, mama, thornton, had, recorded, four, years, earlier, other, white, artists, who, recorded, cover, versions, of, rhythm, and, blues, songs, included, gale, storm, smiley, lewis, i, hear, you, knockin, the, diamonds, the, gladiolas, little, darlin, and, frankie, lymon, the, teenagers, why, do, fools, fall, in, love, the, crew, cuts, the, chords, sh, boom, and, nappy, brown, s, don, t, be, angry, the, fountain, sisters, the, jewels, hearts, of, stone, and, the, maguire, sisters, the, moonglows, sincerely, some, commentators, have, suggested, a, decline, of, rock, and, roll, starting, in, 1958, the, retirement, of, little, richard, to, become, a, preacher, october, 1957, the, departure, of, presley, for, service, in, the, united, states, army, march, 1958, the, scandal, surrounding, jerry, lee, lewis, marriage, to, his, thirteen, year, old, cousin, may, 1958, riots, caused, by, bill, haley, s, ill, fated, tour, of, europe, october, 1958, the, deaths, of, buddy, holly, the, big, bopper, and, ritchie, valens, in, a, plane, crash, february, 1959, the, breaking, of, the, payola, scandal, implicating, major, figures, including, alan, freed, in, bribery, and, corruption, in, promoting, individual, acts, or, songs, november, 1959, the, arrest, of, chuck, berry, december, 1959, and, the, death, of, eddie, cochran, in, a, car, crash, april, 1960, gave, a, sense, that, the, initial, phase, of, rock, and, roll, had, come, to, an, end, during, the, late, 1950s, and, early, 1960s, the, rawer, sounds, of, presley, gene, vincent, jerry, lee, lewis, and, buddy, holly, were, commercially, superseded, by, a, more, polished, commercial, style, of, rock, and, roll, influenced, pop, music, marketing, frequently, emphasized, the, physical, looks, of, the, artist, rather, than, the, music, contributing, to, the, successful, careers, of, ricky, nelson, tommy, sands, bobby, vee, jimmy, clanton, and, the, philadelphia, trio, of, bobby, rydell, frankie, avalon, and, fabian, who, all, became, teen, idols, some, music, historians, have, also, pointed, to, important, and, innovative, developments, that, built, on, rock, and, roll, in, this, period, including, multitrack, recording, developed, by, les, paul, the, electronic, treatment, of, sound, by, such, innovators, as, joe, meek, and, the, wall, of, sound, productions, of, phil, spector, continued, desegregation, of, the, charts, the, rise, of, surf, music, garage, rock, and, the, twist, dance, craze, surf, rock, in, particular, noted, for, the, use, of, reverb, drenched, guitars, became, one, of, the, most, popular, forms, of, american, rock, of, the, early, 1960s, while, the, sounds, of, the, british, invasion, would, become, the, superseding, forms, of, rock, music, during, the, mid, 1960s, a, few, american, artists, were, nonetheless, able, to, achieve, chart, successes, with, rock, and, roll, recordings, during, this, time, the, most, notable, of, these, was, johnny, rivers, who, with, hits, such, as, memphis, 1964, popularized, a, go, go, style, of, club, oriented, danceable, rock, and, roll, that, enjoyed, significant, success, in, spite, of, the, ongoing, british, invasion, another, example, was, bobby, fuller, and, his, group, the, bobby, fuller, four, who, were, especially, inspired, by, buddy, holly, and, stuck, with, a, rock, and, roll, style, scoring, their, most, notable, hit, with, i, fought, the, law, 1965, in, the, 1950s, britain, was, well, placed, to, receive, american, rock, and, roll, music, and, culture, it, shared, a, common, language, had, been, exposed, to, american, culture, through, the, stationing, of, troops, in, the, country, and, shared, many, social, developments, including, the, emergence, of, distinct, youth, sub, cultures, which, in, britain, included, the, teddy, boys, and, the, rockers, trad, jazz, became, popular, in, the, uk, and, many, of, its, musicians, were, influenced, by, related, american, styles, including, boogie, woogie, and, the, blues, the, skiffle, craze, led, by, lonnie, donegan, used, amateurish, versions, of, american, folk, songs, and, encouraged, many, of, the, subsequent, generation, of, rock, and, roll, folk, r, b, and, beat, musicians, to, start, performing, at, the, same, time, british, audiences, were, beginning, to, encounter, american, rock, and, roll, initially, through, films, including, blackboard, jungle, 1955, and, rock, around, the, clock, 1956, both, movies, featured, the, bill, haley, his, comets, hit, rock, around, the, clock, which, first, entered, the, british, charts, in, early, 1955, four, months, before, it, reached, the, us, pop, charts, topped, the, british, charts, later, that, year, and, again, in, 1956, and, helped, identify, rock, and, roll, with, teenage, delinquency, the, initial, response, of, the, british, music, industry, was, to, attempt, to, produce, copies, of, american, records, recorded, with, session, musicians, and, often, fronted, by, teen, idols, more, grass, roots, british, rock, and, rollers, soon, began, to, appear, including, wee, willie, harris, and, tommy, steele, during, this, period, american, rock, and, roll, remained, dominant, but, in, 1958, britain, produced, its, first, authentic, rock, and, roll, song, and, star, when, cliff, richard, reached, number, 2, in, the, charts, with, move, it, at, the, same, time, tv, shows, such, as, six, five, special, and, oh, boy, promoted, the, careers, of, british, rock, and, rollers, like, marty, wilde, and, adam, faith, cliff, richard, and, his, backing, band, the, shadows, were, the, most, successful, home, grown, rock, and, roll, based, acts, of, the, era, other, leading, acts, included, billy, fury, joe, brown, and, johnny, kidd, the, pirates, whose, 1960, hit, song, shakin, all, over, became, a, rock, and, roll, standard, as, interest, in, rock, and, roll, was, beginning, to, subside, in, america, in, the, late, 1950s, and, early, 1960s, it, was, taken, up, by, groups, in, british, cities, like, liverpool, manchester, birmingham, and, london, about, the, same, time, a, british, blues, scene, developed, initially, led, by, purist, blues, followers, such, as, alexis, korner, and, cyril, davies, who, were, inspired, by, american, musicians, such, as, robert, johnson, muddy, waters, and, howlin, wolf, many, groups, moved, towards, the, beat, music, of, rock, and, roll, and, rhythm, and, blues, from, skiffle, like, the, quarrymen, who, became, the, beatles, producing, a, form, of, rock, and, roll, revivalism, that, carried, them, and, many, other, groups, to, national, success, from, about, 1963, and, to, international, success, from, 1964, known, in, america, as, the, british, invasion, groups, that, followed, the, beatles, included, the, beat, influenced, freddie, and, the, dreamers, wayne, fontana, and, the, mindbenders, herman, s, hermits, and, the, dave, clark, five, early, british, rhythm, and, blues, groups, with, more, blues, influences, include, the, animals, the, rolling, stones, and, the, yardbirds, rock, and, roll, influenced, lifestyles, fashion, attitudes, and, language, in, addition, rock, and, roll, may, have, contributed, to, the, civil, rights, movement, because, both, african, american, and, european, american, teens, enjoyed, the, music, many, early, rock, and, roll, songs, dealt, with, issues, of, cars, school, dating, and, clothing, the, lyrics, of, rock, and, roll, songs, described, events, and, conflicts, to, which, most, listeners, could, relate, through, personal, experience, topics, such, as, sex, that, had, generally, been, considered, taboo, began, to, appear, in, rock, and, roll, lyrics, this, new, music, tried, to, break, boundaries, and, express, emotions, that, people, were, actually, feeling, but, had, not, discussed, openly, an, awakening, began, to, take, place, in, american, youth, culture, in, the, crossover, of, african, american, race, music, to, a, growing, white, youth, audience, the, popularization, of, rock, and, roll, involved, both, black, performers, reaching, a, white, audience, and, white, musicians, performing, african, american, music, rock, and, roll, appeared, at, a, time, when, racial, tensions, in, the, united, states, were, entering, a, new, phase, with, the, beginnings, of, the, civil, rights, movement, for, desegregation, leading, to, the, u, s, supreme, court, ruling, that, abolished, the, policy, of, separate, but, equal, in, 1954, but, leaving, a, policy, which, would, be, extremely, difficult, to, enforce, in, parts, of, the, united, states, the, coming, together, of, white, youth, audiences, and, black, music, in, rock, and, roll, inevitably, provoked, strong, white, racist, reactions, within, the, us, with, many, whites, condemning, its, breaking, down, of, barriers, based, on, color, many, observers, saw, rock, and, roll, as, heralding, the, way, for, desegregation, in, creating, a, new, form, of, music, that, encouraged, racial, cooperation, and, shared, experience, many, authors, have, argued, that, early, rock, and, roll, was, instrumental, in, the, way, both, white, and, black, teenagers, identified, themselves, several, rock, historians, have, claimed, that, rock, and, roll, was, one, of, the, first, music, genres, to, define, an, age, group, it, gave, teenagers, a, sense, of, belonging, even, when, they, were, alone, rock, and, roll, is, often, identified, with, the, emergence, of, teen, culture, among, the, first, baby, boomer, generation, who, had, greater, relative, affluence, and, leisure, time, and, adopted, rock, and, roll, as, part, of, a, distinct, subculture, this, involved, not, just, music, absorbed, via, radio, record, buying, jukeboxes, and, tv, programs, like, american, bandstand, but, also, extended, to, film, clothes, hair, cars, and, motorcycles, and, distinctive, language, the, youth, culture, exemplified, by, rock, and, roll, was, a, recurring, source, of, concern, for, older, generations, who, worried, about, juvenile, delinquency, and, social, rebellion, particularly, because, to, a, large, extent, rock, and, roll, culture, was, shared, by, different, racial, and, social, groups, in, america, that, concern, was,
