https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhyme
a, rhyme, is, a, repetition, of, similar, sounds, usually, the, exact, same, phonemes, in, the, final, stressed, syllables, and, any, following, syllables, of, two, or, more, words, most, often, this, kind, of, rhyming, perfect, rhyming, is, consciously, used, for, a, musical, or, aesthetic, effect, in, the, final, position, of, lines, within, poems, or, songs, more, broadly, a, rhyme, may, also, variously, refer, to, other, types, of, similar, sounds, near, the, ends, of, two, or, more, words, furthermore, the, word, rhyme, has, come, to, be, sometimes, used, as, a, shorthand, term, for, any, brief, poem, such, as, a, nursery, rhyme, or, balliol, rhyme, the, word, derives, from, old, french, rime, or, ryme, which, might, be, derived, from, old, frankish, r, m, a, germanic, term, meaning, series, or, sequence, attested, in, old, english, old, english, r, m, meaning, enumeration, series, or, numeral, and, old, high, german, r, m, ultimately, cognate, to, old, irish, r, m, ancient, greek, arithmos, number, alternatively, the, old, french, words, may, derive, from, latin, rhythmus, from, ancient, greek, rhythmos, rhythm, the, spelling, rhyme, from, the, original, rime, was, introduced, at, the, beginning, of, the, modern, english, period, from, a, learned, but, perhaps, etymologically, incorrect, association, with, latin, rhythmus, the, older, spelling, rime, survives, in, modern, english, as, a, rare, alternative, spelling, cf, the, rime, of, the, ancient, mariner, a, distinction, between, the, spellings, is, also, sometimes, made, in, the, study, of, linguistics, and, phonology, for, which, rime, or, rhyme, is, used, to, refer, to, the, nucleus, and, coda, of, a, syllable, some, prefer, to, spell, it, rime, to, distinguish, it, from, the, poetic, rhyme, covered, by, this, article, see, syllable, rime, rhyme, partly, seems, to, be, enjoyed, simply, as, a, repeating, pattern, that, is, pleasant, to, hear, it, also, serves, as, a, powerful, mnemonic, device, facilitating, memorization, the, regular, use, of, tail, rhyme, helps, to, mark, off, the, ends, of, lines, thus, clarifying, the, metrical, structure, for, the, listener, as, with, other, poetic, techniques, poets, use, it, to, suit, their, own, purposes, for, example, william, shakespeare, often, used, a, rhyming, couplet, to, mark, off, the, end, of, a, scene, in, a, play, the, word, rhyme, can, be, used, in, a, specific, and, a, general, sense, in, the, specific, sense, two, words, rhyme, if, their, final, stressed, vowel, and, all, following, sounds, are, identical, two, lines, of, poetry, rhyme, if, their, final, strong, positions, are, filled, with, rhyming, words, examples, are, sight, and, flight, deign, and, gain, madness, and, sadness, love, and, dove, perfect, rhymes, can, be, classified, by, the, location, of, the, final, stressed, syllable, feminine, and, dactylic, rhymes, may, also, be, realized, as, compound, or, mosaic, rhymes, poet, know, it, in, the, general, sense, general, rhyme, can, refer, to, various, kinds, of, phonetic, similarity, between, words, and, to, the, use, of, such, similar, sounding, words, in, organizing, verse, rhymes, in, this, general, sense, are, classified, according, to, the, degree, and, manner, of, the, phonetic, similarity, identical, rhymes, are, considered, less, than, perfect, in, english, poetry, but, are, valued, more, highly, in, other, literatures, such, as, for, example, rime, riche, in, french, poetry, though, homophones, and, homonyms, satisfy, the, first, condition, for, rhyming, that, is, that, the, stressed, vowel, sound, is, the, same, they, do, not, satisfy, the, second, that, the, preceding, consonant, be, different, as, stated, above, in, a, perfect, rhyme, the, last, stressed, vowel, and, all, following, sounds, are, identical, in, both, words, if, the, sound, preceding, the, stressed, vowel, is, also, identical, the, rhyme, is, sometimes, considered, to, be, inferior, and, not, a, perfect, rhyme, after, all, an, example, of, such, a, super, rhyme, or, more, than, perfect, rhyme, is, the, identical, rhyme, in, which, not, only, the, vowels, but, also, the, onsets, of, the, rhyming, syllables, are, identical, as, in, gun, and, begun, punning, rhymes, such, as, bare, and, bear, are, also, identical, rhymes, the, rhyme, may, extend, even, farther, back, than, the, last, stressed, vowel, if, it, extends, all, the, way, to, the, beginning, of, the, line, so, that, there, are, two, lines, that, sound, very, similar, or, identical, it, is, called, a, holorhyme, for, i, scream, for, ice, cream, in, poetics, these, would, be, considered, identity, rather, than, rhyme, eye, rhymes, or, sight, rhymes, or, spelling, rhymes, refer, to, similarity, in, spelling, but, not, in, sound, where, the, final, sounds, are, spelled, identically, but, pronounced, differently, examples, in, english, are, cough, bough, and, love, move, some, early, written, poetry, appears, to, contain, these, but, in, many, cases, the, words, used, rhymed, at, the, time, of, writing, and, subsequent, changes, in, pronunciation, have, meant, that, the, rhyme, is, now, lost, mind, rhyme, is, a, kind, of, substitution, rhyme, similar, to, rhyming, slang, but, it, is, less, generally, codified, and, is, heard, only, when, generated, by, a, specific, verse, context, for, instance, this, sugar, is, neat, and, tastes, so, sour, if, a, reader, or, listener, thinks, of, the, word, sweet, instead, of, sour, a, mind, rhyme, has, occurred, rhymes, may, be, classified, according, to, their, position, in, the, verse, a, rhyme, scheme, is, the, pattern, of, rhyming, lines, in, a, poem, in, many, languages, including, modern, european, languages, and, arabic, poets, use, rhyme, in, set, patterns, as, a, structural, element, for, specific, poetic, forms, such, as, ballads, sonnets, and, rhyming, couplets, some, rhyming, schemes, have, become, associated, with, a, specific, language, culture, or, period, while, other, rhyming, schemes, have, achieved, use, across, languages, cultures, or, time, periods, however, the, use, of, structural, rhyme, is, not, universal, even, within, the, european, tradition, much, modern, poetry, avoids, traditional, rhyme, schemes, the, earliest, surviving, evidence, of, rhyming, is, the, chinese, shi, jing, ca, 10th, century, bce, rhyme, is, also, occasionally, used, in, the, bible, classical, greek, and, latin, poetry, did, not, usually, rhyme, but, rhyme, was, used, very, occasionally, for, instance, catullus, includes, partial, rhymes, in, the, poem, cui, dono, lepidum, novum, libellum, the, ancient, greeks, knew, rhyme, and, rhymes, in, the, wasps, by, aristophanes, are, noted, by, a, translator, rhyme, became, a, permanent, even, obligatory, feature, of, poetry, in, hebrew, language, around, the, 4th, century, ce, it, is, found, in, the, jewish, liturgical, poetry, written, in, the, byzantine, empire, era, this, was, realized, by, scholars, only, recently, thanks, to, the, thousands, of, piyyuts, that, have, been, discovered, in, the, cairo, geniza, it, is, assumed, that, the, principle, of, rhyme, was, transferred, from, hebrew, liturgical, poetry, to, the, poetry, of, the, syriac, christianity, written, in, aramaic, and, through, this, mediation, introduced, into, latin, poetry, and, then, into, all, other, languages, of, europe, rhyme, is, central, to, classical, arabic, poetry, tracing, back, to, its, 6th, century, pre, islamic, roots, according, to, some, archaic, sources, irish, literature, introduced, the, rhyme, to, early, medieval, europe, but, that, is, a, disputed, claim, in, the, 7th, century, the, irish, had, brought, the, art, of, rhyming, verses, to, a, high, pitch, of, perfection, the, leonine, verse, is, notable, for, introducing, rhyme, into, high, medieval, literature, in, the, 12th, century, rhyme, entered, european, poetry, in, the, high, middle, ages, in, part, under, the, influence, of, the, arabic, language, in, al, andalus, modern, spain, arabic, language, poets, used, rhyme, extensively, from, the, first, development, of, literary, arabic, in, the, sixth, century, as, in, their, long, rhyming, qasidas, since, dialects, vary, and, languages, change, over, time, lines, that, rhyme, in, a, given, register, or, era, may, not, rhyme, in, another, and, it, may, not, be, clear, whether, one, should, pronounce, the, words, so, that, they, rhyme, an, example, is, this, couplet, from, handel, s, judas, maccabaeus, rhymes, were, widely, spread, in, the, arabian, peninsula, around, the, 6th, century, in, letters, poems, and, songs, as, well, as, long, rhyming, qasidas, in, addition, the, quran, uses, a, form, of, rhymed, prose, named, saj, rhyming, in, the, celtic, languages, takes, a, drastically, different, course, from, most, other, western, rhyming, schemes, despite, strong, contact, with, the, romance, and, english, patterns, even, today, despite, extensive, interaction, with, english, and, french, culture, celtic, rhyme, continues, to, demonstrate, native, characteristics, brian, cu, v, sets, out, the, rules, of, rhyme, in, irish, poetry, of, the, classical, period, the, last, stressed, vowel, and, any, subsequent, long, vowels, must, be, identical, in, order, for, two, words, to, rhyme, consonants, are, grouped, into, six, classes, for, the, purpose, of, rhyme, they, need, not, be, identical, but, must, belong, to, the, same, class, thus, b, and, d, can, rhyme, both, being, voiced, plosives, as, can, bh, and, l, which, are, both, voiced, continuants, but, l, a, voiced, continuant, cannot, rhyme, with, ph, a, voiceless, continuant, furthermore, for, perfect, rhyme, a, palatalized, consonant, may, be, balanced, only, by, a, palatalized, consonant, and, a, velarized, consonant, by, a, velarized, one, in, the, post, classical, period, these, rules, fell, into, desuetude, and, in, popular, verse, simple, assonance, often, suffices, as, can, be, seen, in, an, example, of, irish, gaelic, rhyme, from, the, traditional, song, br, d, g, n, mh, ille, is, a, bhr, d, g, n, mh, ille, s, t, d, fh, g, mo, chro, cr, ite, oh, young, bridget, o, malley, you, have, left, my, heart, breaking, here, the, vowels, are, the, same, but, the, consonants, although, both, palatalized, do, not, fall, into, the, same, class, in, the, bardic, rhyming, scheme, besides, the, vowel, consonant, aspect, of, rhyming, chinese, rhymes, often, include, tone, quality, that, is, tonal, contour, as, an, integral, linguistic, factor, in, determining, rhyme, use, of, rhyme, in, classical, chinese, poetry, typically, but, not, always, appears, in, the, form, of, paired, couplets, with, end, rhyming, in, the, final, syllable, of, each, couplet, another, important, aspect, of, rhyme, in, regard, to, chinese, language, studies, is, the, study, or, reconstruction, of, past, varieties, of, chinese, such, as, middle, chinese, old, english, poetry, is, mostly, alliterative, verse, one, of, the, earliest, rhyming, poems, in, english, is, the, rhyming, poem, as, stress, is, important, in, english, lexical, stress, is, one, of, the, factors, that, affects, the, similarity, of, sounds, for, the, perception, of, rhyme, perfect, rhyme, can, be, defined, as, the, case, when, two, words, rhyme, if, their, final, stressed, vowel, and, all, following, sounds, are, identical, some, words, in, english, such, as, orange, and, silver, are, commonly, regarded, as, having, no, rhyme, although, a, clever, writer, can, get, around, this, for, example, by, obliquely, rhyming, orange, with, combinations, of, words, like, door, hinge, or, with, lesser, known, words, like, blorenge, a, hill, in, wales, or, the, surname, gorringe, it, is, generally, easier, to, move, the, word, out, of, rhyming, position, or, replace, it, with, a, synonym, orange, could, become, amber, while, silver, could, become, a, combination, of, bright, and, argent, a, skilled, orator, might, be, able, to, tweak, the, pronunciation, of, certain, words, to, facilitate, a, stronger, rhyme, for, example, pronouncing, orange, as, oringe, to, rhyme, with, door, hinge, one, view, of, rhyme, in, english, is, from, john, milton, s, preface, to, paradise, lost, the, measure, is, english, heroic, verse, without, rime, as, that, of, homer, in, greek, and, of, virgil, in, latin, rime, being, no, necessary, adjunct, or, true, ornament, of, poem, or, good, verse, in, longer, works, especially, but, the, invention, of, a, barbarous, age, to, set, off, wretched, matter, and, lame, meeter, grac, t, indeed, since, by, the, use, of, some, famous, modern, poets, carried, away, by, custom, a, more, tempered, view, is, taken, by, w, h, auden, in, the, dyer, s, hand, rhymes, meters, stanza, forms, etc, are, like, servants, if, the, master, is, fair, enough, to, win, their, affection, and, firm, enough, to, command, their, respect, the, result, is, an, orderly, happy, household, if, he, is, too, tyrannical, they, give, notice, if, he, lacks, authority, they, become, slovenly, impertinent, drunk, and, dishonest, forced, or, clumsy, rhyme, is, often, a, key, ingredient, of, doggerel, in, french, poetry, unlike, in, english, it, is, common, to, have, identical, rhymes, in, which, not, only, the, vowels, of, the, final, syllables, of, the, lines, rhyme, but, their, onset, consonants, consonnes, d, appui, as, well, to, the, ear, of, someone, accustomed, to, english, verse, this, often, sounds, like, a, very, weak, rhyme, for, example, an, english, perfect, rhyme, of, homophones, flour, and, flower, would, seem, weak, whereas, a, french, rhyme, of, homophones, doigt, finger, and, doit, must, or, point, point, and, point, not, is, not, only, acceptable, but, quite, common, rhymes, are, sometimes, classified, into, the, categories, of, rime, pauvre, poor, rhyme, rime, suffisante, sufficient, rhyme, rime, riche, rich, rhyme, and, rime, richissime, very, rich, rhyme, according, to, the, number, of, rhyming, sounds, in, the, two, words, or, in, the, parts, of, the, two, verses, for, example, to, rhyme, tu, with, vu, would, be, a, poor, rhyme, the, words, have, only, the, vowel, in, common, to, rhyme, pas, with, bras, a, sufficient, rhyme, with, the, vowel, and, the, silent, consonant, in, common, and, tante, with, attente, a, rich, rhyme, with, the, vowel, the, onset, consonant, and, the, coda, consonant, with, its, mute, e, in, common, authorities, disagree, however, on, exactly, where, to, place, the, boundaries, between, the, categories, classical, french, rhyme, not, only, differs, from, english, rhyme, in, its, different, treatment, of, onset, consonants, it, also, treats, coda, consonants, in, a, distinctive, way, french, spelling, includes, several, final, letters, that, are, no, longer, pronounced, and, that, in, many, cases, have, never, been, pronounced, such, final, unpronounced, letters, continue, to, affect, rhyme, according, to, the, rules, of, classical, french, versification, they, are, encountered, in, almost, all, of, the, pre, 20th, century, french, verse, texts, but, these, rhyming, rules, are, almost, never, taken, into, account, from, the, 20th, century, the, most, important, silent, letter, is, the, mute, e, in, spoken, french, today, final, e, is, in, some, regional, accents, in, paris, for, example, omitted, after, consonants, but, in, classical, french, prosody, it, was, considered, an, integral, part, of, the, rhyme, even, when, following, the, vowel, joue, could, rhyme, with, boue, but, not, with, trou, rhyming, words, ending, with, this, silent, e, were, said, to, make, up, a, double, rhyme, while, words, not, ending, with, this, silent, e, made, up, a, single, rhyme, it, was, a, principle, of, stanza, formation, that, single, and, double, rhymes, had, to, alternate, in, the, stanza, virtually, all, 17th, century, french, plays, in, verse, alternate, masculine, and, feminine, alexandrin, couplets, the, now, silent, final, consonants, present, a, more, complex, case, they, too, were, traditionally, an, integral, part, of, the, rhyme, such, that, pont, rhymed, with, vont, but, not, with, long, the, voicing, of, consonants, was, lost, in, liaison, and, thus, ignored, so, pont, also, rhymed, with, rond, there, are, a, few, rules, that, govern, most, word, final, consonants, in, archaic, french, pronunciation, holorime, is, an, extreme, example, of, rime, richissime, spanning, an, entire, verse, alphonse, allais, was, a, notable, exponent, of, holorime, here, is, an, example, of, a, holorime, couplet, from, marc, monnier, gall, amant, de, la, reine, alla, tour, magnanime, galamment, de, l, ar, ne, la, tour, magne, n, mes, gallus, the, queen, s, lover, went, a, magnanimous, gesture, gallantly, from, the, arena, to, the, great, tower, at, n, mes, because, german, phonology, features, a, wide, array, of, vowel, sounds, certain, imperfect, rhymes, are, widely, admitted, in, german, poetry, these, include, rhyming, e, with, and, rhyming, i, with, rhyming, ei, with, eu, spelled, u, in, some, words, and, rhyming, a, long, vowel, with, its, short, counterpart, some, examples, of, imperfect, rhymes, all, from, friedrich, schiller, s, an, die, freude, ancient, greek, poetry, is, strictly, metrical, rhyme, is, used, if, at, all, only, as, an, occasional, rhetorical, flourish, the, first, greek, to, write, rhyming, poetry, was, the, fourteenth, century, cretan, stephanos, sachlikis, rhyme, is, now, a, common, fixture, of, greek, poetry, ancient, hebrew, rarely, employed, rhyme, e, g, in, exodus, 29, 35, the, identical, part, in, both, rhyming, words, being, axa, rhyme, became, a, permanent, even, obligatory, feature, of, poetry, in, hebrew, language, around, the, 4th, century, ce, it, is, found, in, the, jewish, liturgical, poetry, written, in, the, byzantine, empire, era, this, was,

all, other, languages, of, europe, in, latin, rhetoric, and, poetry, homeoteleuton, and, alliteration, were, frequently, used, devices, tail, rhyme, was, occasionally, used, as, in, this, piece, of, poetry, by, cicero, o, fortu, natam, natam, me, consule, romam, o, fortunate, rome, to, be, born, with, me, consul, but, tail, rhyme, was, not, used, as, a, prominent, structural, feature, of, latin, poetry, until, it, was, introduced, under, the, influence, of, local, vernacular, traditions, in, the, early, middle, ages, this, is, the, latin, hymn, dies, irae, dies, irae, dies, illa, solvet, saeclum, in, favilla, teste, david, cum, sybilla, the, day, of, wrath, that, day, which, will, reduce, the, world, to, ashes, as, foretold, by, david, and, the, sybil, medieval, poetry, may, mix,

unrhymed, verse, was, never, popular, although, it, was, sometimes, imitated, from, latin, homer, s, virgil, s, and, even, milton, s, epic, poems, were, furnished, with, rhymes, by, polish, translators, because, of, paroxytonic, accentuation, in, polish, feminine, rhymes, always, prevailed, rules, of, polish, rhyme, were, established, in, 16th, century, then, only, feminine, rhymes, were, allowed, in, syllabic, verse, system, together, with, introducing, syllabo, accentual, metres, masculine, rhymes, began, to, occur, in, polish, poetry, they, were, most, popular, at, the, end, of, 19th, century, the, most, frequent, rhyme, scheme, in, old, polish, 16th, 18th, centuries, was, couplet, aabbccdd, but, polish, poets, having, perfect, knowledge, of, italian, language, and,

cannot, rhyme, with, each, other, there, are, some, unique, rhyming, schemes, in, dravidian, languages, like, tamil, specifically, the, rhyme, called, etukai, anaphora, occurs, on, the, second, consonant, of, each, line, the, other, rhyme, and, related, patterns, are, called, m, n, ai, alliteration, to, ai, epiphora, and, ira, ai, ki, avi, parallelism, some, classical, tamil, poetry, forms, such, as, ve, p, have, rigid, grammars, for, rhyme, to, the, point, that, they, could, be, expressed, as, a, context, free, grammar, rhymes, are, called, qafiya, in, urdu, qafiya, has, a, very, important, place, in, urdu, poetry, couplet, of, an, urdu, ghazal, is, incomplete, without, a, qafiya, following, is, an, example, of, an, urdu, couplet, from, faiz, ahmed, faiz, s, ghazal, dono,
