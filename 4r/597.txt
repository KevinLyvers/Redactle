cinematography, from, ancient, greek, k, n, ma, movement, and, gr, phein, to, write, draw, paint, etc, is, the, art, of, motion, picture, and, more, recently, electronic, video, camera, photography, cinematographers, use, a, lens, to, focus, reflected, light, from, objects, into, a, real, image, that, is, transferred, to, some, image, sensor, or, light, sensitive, material, inside, the, movie, camera, these, exposures, are, created, sequentially, and, preserved, for, later, processing, and, viewing, as, a, motion, picture, capturing, images, with, an, electronic, image, sensor, produces, an, electrical, charge, for, each, pixel, in, the, image, which, is, electronically, processed, and, stored, in, a, video, file, for, subsequent, processing, or, display, images, captured, with, photographic, emulsion, result, in, a, series, of, invisible, latent, images, on, the, film, stock, which, are, chemically, developed, into, a, visible, image, the, images, on, the, film, stock, are, projected, for, viewing, in, the, same, motion, picture, cinematography, finds, uses, in, many, fields, of, science, and, business, as, well, as, for, entertainment, purposes, and, mass, communication, in, the, 1830s, three, different, solutions, for, moving, images, were, invented, based, on, the, concept, of, revolving, drums, and, disks, the, stroboscope, by, simon, von, stampfer, in, austria, the, phenakistoscope, by, joseph, plateau, in, belgium, and, the, zoetrope, by, william, horner, in, britain, in, 1845, francis, ronalds, invented, the, first, successful, camera, able, to, make, continuous, recordings, of, the, varying, indications, of, meteorological, and, geomagnetic, instruments, over, time, the, cameras, were, supplied, to, numerous, observatories, around, the, world, and, some, remained, in, use, until, well, into, the, 20th, century, william, lincoln, patented, a, device, in, 1867, that, showed, animated, pictures, called, the, wheel, of, life, or, zoopraxiscope, in, it, moving, drawings, or, photographs, were, watched, through, a, slit, on, 19, june, 1878, eadweard, muybridge, successfully, photographed, a, horse, named, sallie, gardner, in, fast, motion, using, a, series, of, 24, stereoscopic, cameras, the, cameras, were, arranged, along, a, track, parallel, to, the, horse, s, and, each, camera, shutter, was, controlled, by, a, trip, wire, triggered, by, the, horse, s, hooves, they, were, 21, inches, apart, to, cover, the, 20, feet, taken, by, the, horse, stride, taking, pictures, at, one, thousandth, of, a, second, at, the, end, of, the, decade, muybridge, had, adapted, sequences, of, his, photographs, to, a, zoopraxiscope, for, short, primitive, projected, movies, which, were, sensations, on, his, lecture, tours, by, 1879, or, 1880, four, years, later, in, 1882, french, scientist, tienne, jules, marey, invented, a, chronophotographic, gun, which, was, capable, of, taking, 12, consecutive, frames, a, second, and, recording, all, the, frames, of, the, same, picture, the, late, nineteenth, to, the, early, twentieth, centuries, brought, rise, to, the, use, of, film, not, only, for, entertainment, purposes, but, for, scientific, exploration, as, well, french, biologist, and, filmmaker, jean, painleve, lobbied, heavily, for, the, use, of, film, in, the, scientific, field, as, the, new, medium, was, more, efficient, in, capturing, and, documenting, the, behavior, movement, and, environment, of, microorganisms, cells, and, bacteria, than, the, naked, eye, the, introduction, of, film, into, scientific, fields, allowed, for, not, only, the, viewing, of, new, images, and, objects, such, as, cells, and, natural, objects, but, also, the, viewing, of, them, in, real, time, whereas, prior, to, the, invention, of, moving, pictures, scientists, and, doctors, alike, had, to, rely, on, hand, drawn, sketches, of, human, anatomy, and, its, microorganisms, this, posed, a, great, inconvenience, to, the, scientific, and, medical, worlds, the, development, of, film, and, increased, usage, of, cameras, allowed, doctors, and, scientists, to, grasp, a, better, understanding, and, knowledge, of, their, projects, the, origins, of, today, s, cinema, go, back, to, the, lumi, re, brothers, auguste, and, louis, who, in, 1895, developed, a, machine, called, the, cinematographe, which, had, the, ability, to, capture, and, show, moving, images, the, early, era, of, cinema, saw, rapid, innovation, filmmakers, discover, and, apply, new, methods, such, as, editing, special, effects, close, ups, etc, hollywood, began, to, emerge, as, the, mecca, of, the, film, industry, and, many, of, the, famous, studios, today, such, as, warner, bros, and, paramount, pictures, began, to, rule, the, film, world, over, time, cinema, and, cinematography, have, changed, drastically, from, the, silent, films, of, the, early, 20th, century, to, the, ability, of, sound, to, be, added, to, films, in, the, 1920s, widescreen, and, color, films, in, the, 50s, huge, improvements, in, general, creativity, and, methodology, have, emerged, the, experimental, film, roundhay, garden, scene, filmed, by, louis, le, prince, in, roundhay, leeds, england, on, october, 14, 1888, is, the, earliest, surviving, motion, picture, this, movie, was, shot, on, paper, film, an, experimental, film, camera, was, developed, by, british, inventor, william, friese, greene, and, patented, in, 1889, w, k, l, dickson, working, under, the, direction, of, thomas, alva, edison, was, the, first, to, design, a, successful, apparatus, the, kinetograph, patented, in, 1891, this, camera, took, a, series, of, instantaneous, photographs, on, standard, eastman, kodak, photographic, emulsion, coated, onto, a, transparent, celluloid, strip, 35, mm, wide, the, results, of, this, work, were, first, shown, in, public, in, 1893, using, the, viewing, apparatus, also, designed, by, dickson, the, kinetoscope, contained, within, a, large, box, only, one, person, at, a, time, looking, into, it, through, a, peephole, could, view, the, movie, in, the, following, year, charles, francis, jenkins, and, his, projector, the, phantoscope, made, a, successful, audience, viewing, while, louis, and, auguste, lumi, re, perfected, the, cin, matographe, an, apparatus, that, took, printed, and, projected, film, in, paris, in, december, 1895, the, lumi, re, brothers, were, the, first, to, present, projected, moving, photographic, pictures, to, a, paying, audience, of, more, than, one, person, in, 1896, movie, theaters, were, open, in, france, paris, lyon, bordeaux, nice, marseille, italy, rome, milan, naples, genoa, venice, bologna, forl, brussels, and, london, the, chronological, improvements, in, the, medium, may, be, listed, concisely, in, 1896, edison, showed, his, improved, vitascope, projector, the, first, commercially, successful, projector, in, the, u, s, cooper, hewitt, invented, mercury, lamps, which, made, it, practical, to, shoot, films, indoors, without, sunlight, in, 1905, the, first, animated, cartoon, was, produced, in, 1906, credits, began, to, appear, at, the, beginning, of, motion, pictures, in, 1911, the, bell, and, howell, 2709, movie, camera, invented, in, 1915, allowed, directors, to, make, close, ups, without, physically, moving, the, camera, by, the, late, 1920s, most, of, the, movies, produced, were, sound, films, wide, screen, formats, were, first, experimented, within, the, 1950s, by, the, 1970s, most, movies, were, color, films, imax, and, other, 70mm, formats, gained, popularity, wide, distribution, of, films, became, commonplace, setting, the, ground, for, blockbusters, film, cinematography, dominated, the, motion, picture, industry, from, its, inception, until, the, 2010s, when, digital, cinematography, became, dominant, film, cinematography, is, still, used, by, some, directors, especially, in, specific, applications, or, out, of, fondness, for, the, format, from, its, birth, in, the, 1880s, movies, were, predominantly, monochrome, contrary, to, popular, belief, monochrome, does, not, always, mean, black, and, white, it, means, a, movie, shot, in, a, single, tone, or, color, since, the, cost, of, tinted, film, bases, was, substantially, higher, most, movies, were, produced, in, black, and, white, monochrome, even, with, the, advent, of, early, color, experiments, the, greater, expense, of, color, meant, films, were, mostly, made, in, black, and, white, until, the, 1950s, when, cheaper, color, processes, were, introduced, and, in, some, years, percentage, of, films, shot, on, color, film, surpassed, 51, by, the, 1960s, color, became, by, far, the, dominant, film, stock, in, the, coming, decades, the, usage, of, color, film, greatly, increased, while, monochrome, films, became, scarce, black, and, white, cinematography, is, a, technique, used, in, filmmaking, where, the, images, are, captured, and, presented, in, shades, of, gray, without, color, this, artistic, approach, has, a, rich, history, and, has, been, employed, in, various, films, throughout, cinema, s, evolution, it, is, a, powerful, tool, that, allows, filmmakers, to, emphasize, contrast, texture, and, lighting, enhancing, the, visual, storytelling, experience, the, use, of, black, and, white, cinematography, dates, back, to, the, early, days, of, cinema, when, color, film, was, not, yet, available, filmmakers, relied, on, this, technique, to, create, visually, striking, and, atmospheric, films, even, with, the, advent, of, color, film, technology, black, and, white, cinematography, continued, to, be, utilized, for, artistic, and, thematic, purposes, ken, dancyger, s, book, the, technique, of, film, and, video, editing, history, theory, and, practice, provides, valuable, insights, into, the, historical, and, theoretical, aspects, of, black, and, white, cinematography, dancyger, explores, how, this, technique, has, been, employed, throughout, film, history, examining, its, impact, on, storytelling, mood, and, visual, aesthetics, the, book, delves, into, the, artistic, choices, and, technical, considerations, involved, in, creating, compelling, black, and, white, imagery, offering, a, comprehensive, understanding, of, the, technique, black, and, white, cinematography, allows, filmmakers, to, focus, on, the, interplay, of, light, and, shadow, emphasizing, the, contrast, between, different, elements, within, a, scene, this, technique, can, evoke, a, sense, of, nostalgia, evoke, a, specific, time, period, or, create, a, timeless, and, classic, feel, by, stripping, away, color, filmmakers, can, emphasize, the, composition, shapes, and, textures, within, the, frame, enhancing, the, visual, impact, notable, films, that, have, employed, black, and, white, cinematography, include, classics, such, as, casablanca, 1942, raging, bull, 1980, and, schindler, s, list, 1993, these, films, showcase, the, power, and, versatility, of, black, and, white, cinematography, in, creating, emotionally, resonant, visuals, black, and, white, cinematography, remains, a, relevant, and, widely, used, technique, in, modern, filmmaking, it, continues, to, be, employed, by, filmmakers, to, evoke, specific, moods, convey, a, sense, of, timelessness, and, enhance, the, artistic, expression, of, their, stories, after, the, advent, of, motion, pictures, a, tremendous, amount, of, energy, was, invested, in, the, production, of, photography, in, natural, color, the, invention, of, the, talking, picture, further, increased, the, demand, for, the, use, of, color, photography, however, in, comparison, to, other, technological, advances, of, the, time, the, arrival, of, color, photography, was, a, relatively, slow, process, early, movies, were, not, actually, color, movies, since, they, were, shot, monochrome, and, hand, colored, or, machine, colored, afterward, such, movies, are, referred, to, as, colored, and, not, color, the, earliest, such, example, is, the, hand, tinted, annabelle, serpentine, dance, in, 1895, by, edison, manufacturing, company, machine, based, tinting, later, became, popular, tinting, continued, until, the, advent, of, natural, color, cinematography, in, the, 1910s, many, black, and, white, movies, have, been, colorized, recently, using, digital, tinting, this, includes, footage, shot, from, both, world, wars, sporting, events, and, political, propaganda, in, 1902, edward, raymond, turner, produced, the, first, films, with, a, natural, color, process, rather, than, using, colorization, techniques, in, 1909, kinemacolor, was, first, shown, to, the, public, in, 1917, the, earliest, version, of, technicolor, was, introduced, kodachrome, was, introduced, in, 1935, eastmancolor, was, introduced, in, 1950, and, became, the, color, standard, for, the, rest, of, the, century, in, the, 2010s, color, films, were, largely, superseded, by, color, digital, cinematography, in, digital, cinematography, the, movie, is, shot, on, digital, media, such, as, flash, storage, as, well, as, distributed, through, a, digital, medium, such, as, a, hard, drive, the, basis, for, digital, cameras, are, metal, oxide, semiconductor, mos, image, sensors, the, first, practical, semiconductor, image, sensor, was, the, charge, coupled, device, ccd, based, on, mos, capacitor, technology, following, the, commercialization, of, ccd, sensors, during, the, late, 1970s, to, early, 1980s, the, entertainment, industry, slowly, began, transitioning, to, digital, imaging, and, digital, video, over, the, next, two, decades, the, ccd, was, followed, by, the, cmos, active, pixel, sensor, cmos, sensor, developed, in, the, 1990s, beginning, in, the, late, 1980s, sony, began, marketing, the, concept, of, electronic, cinematography, utilizing, its, analog, sony, hdvs, professional, video, cameras, the, effort, met, with, very, little, success, however, this, led, to, one, of, the, earliest, digitally, shot, feature, movies, julia, and, julia, 1987, in, 1998, with, the, introduction, of, hdcam, recorders, and, 1920, 1080, pixel, digital, professional, video, cameras, based, on, ccd, technology, the, idea, now, re, branded, as, digital, cinematography, began, to, gain, traction, shot, and, released, in, 1998, the, last, broadcast, is, believed, by, some, to, be, the, first, feature, length, video, shot, and, edited, entirely, on, consumer, level, digital, equipment, in, may, 1999, george, lucas, challenged, the, supremacy, of, the, movie, making, medium, of, film, for, the, first, time, by, including, footage, filmed, with, high, definition, digital, cameras, in, star, wars, episode, i, the, phantom, menace, in, late, 2013, paramount, became, the, first, major, studio, to, distribute, movies, to, theaters, in, digital, format, eliminating, 35mm, film, entirely, since, then, the, demand, of, movies, to, be, developed, onto, digital, format, rather, than, 35mm, has, increased, significantly, as, digital, technology, improved, movie, studios, began, increasingly, shifting, toward, digital, cinematography, since, the, 2010s, digital, cinematography, has, become, the, dominant, form, of, cinematography, after, largely, superseding, film, cinematography, numerous, aspects, contribute, to, the, art, of, cinematography, including, the, first, film, cameras, were, fastened, directly, to, the, head, of, a, tripod, or, other, support, with, only, the, crudest, kind, of, leveling, devices, provided, in, the, manner, of, the, still, camera, tripod, heads, of, the, period, the, earliest, film, cameras, were, thus, effectively, fixed, during, the, shot, and, hence, the, first, camera, movements, were, the, result, of, mounting, a, camera, on, a, moving, vehicle, the, first, known, of, these, was, a, film, shot, by, a, lumi, re, cameraman, from, the, back, platform, of, a, train, leaving, jerusalem, in, 1896, and, by, 1898, there, were, a, number, of, films, shot, from, moving, trains, although, listed, under, the, general, heading, of, panoramas, in, the, sales, catalogues, of, the, time, those, films, shot, straight, forward, from, in, front, of, a, railway, engine, were, usually, specifically, referred, to, as, phantom, rides, in, 1897, robert, w, paul, had, the, first, real, rotating, camera, head, made, to, put, on, a, tripod, so, that, he, could, follow, the, passing, processions, of, queen, victoria, s, diamond, jubilee, in, one, uninterrupted, shot, this, device, had, the, camera, mounted, on, a, vertical, axis, that, could, be, rotated, by, a, worm, gear, driven, by, turning, a, crank, handle, and, paul, put, it, on, general, sale, the, next, year, shots, taken, using, such, a, panning, head, were, also, referred, to, as, panoramas, in, the, film, catalogues, of, the, first, decade, of, the, cinema, this, eventually, led, to, the, creation, of, a, panoramic, photo, as, well, the, standard, pattern, for, early, film, studios, was, provided, by, the, studio, which, georges, m, li, s, had, built, in, 1897, this, had, a, glass, roof, and, three, glass, walls, constructed, after, the, model, of, large, studios, for, still, photography, and, it, was, fitted, with, thin, cotton, cloths, that, could, be, stretched, below, the, roof, to, diffuse, the, direct, ray, of, the, sun, on, sunny, days, the, soft, overall, light, without, real, shadows, that, this, arrangement, produced, which, also, exists, naturally, on, lightly, overcast, days, was, to, become, the, basis, for, film, lighting, in, film, studios, for, the, next, decade, black, and, white, cinematography, is, a, technique, used, in, filmmaking, where, the, images, are, captured, and, presented, in,

stories, there, are, many, types, of, cinematography, that, each, differ, based, on, production, purpose, and, process, these, different, types, of, cinematography, are, similar, in, the, sense, that, they, all, have, the, goal, of, conveying, a, specific, emotion, mood, or, feeling, for, each, different, style, however, they, can, often, convey, different, emotions, and, purposes, some, examples, of, different, types, of, cinematography, can, be, known, as, realism, this, style, of, cinematography, aims, to, create, a, realistic, portrayal, of, the, world, often, using, natural, lighting, handheld, cameras, and, a, documentary, like, approach, to, filming, classic, hollywood, is, a, style, of, cinematography, characterized, by, its, use, of, highly, polished, studio, produced, films, with, glamorous, sets, bright, lighting, and, romanticized, narratives, film, noir, is, a, style, of, cinematography, that, is, characterized, by, its, use, of, stark, contrast, and, chiaroscuro, lighting, low, key, lighting, and, a, dark, brooding, atmosphere, it, often, features, crime, mystery, and, morally, ambiguous, characters, to, convey, mood, emotion, narrative, and, other, factors, within, the, shot, cinematography, is, implemented, by, using, different, aspects, within, a, film, lighting, on, the, scene, can, affect, the, mood, of, a, scene, or, film, darker, shots, with, less, natural, light, can, be, gloomy, scary, sad, intense, brighter, lighting, can, equate, to, a, happier, exciting, more, positive, mood, camera, angle, can, affect, a, scene, by, setting, perspective, it, conveys, how, characters, or, the, audience, see, something, and, through, what, angle, camera, angle, can, also, play, an, important, role, by, highlighting, either, a, close, up, detail, or, background, setting, a, close, up, angle, can, highlight, detail, on, someone, s, face, while, a, wider, lens, can, give, key, information, that, takes, place, in, the, background, of, a, shot, camera, distance, can, highlight, specific, details, that, can, be, important, to, a, film, shot, from, very, far, away, a, group, of, people, can, all, look, the, same, but, once, you, zoom, in, very, close, the, viewer, is, able, to, see, differences, within, the, population, through, details, like, facial, expression, and, body, language, coloring, is, similar, to, lighting, in, the, way, that, it, plays, an, important, role, in, setting, mood, and, emotion, throughout, a, shot, a, color, like, green, can, convey, balance, and, peace, through, scenes, of, nature, a, shot, with, a, lot, of, red, can, express, anger, intensity, passion, or, love, while, some, of, these, emotions, might, not, come, out, intentionally, while, seeing, color, it, is, a, subconscious, fact, that, color, within, cinematography, can, have, a, large, effect, speed, is, a, vital, element, in, cinematography, that, can, be, used, in, a, variety, of, ways, such, as, the, creation, of, action, or, a, sense, of, movement, speed, can, be, further, used, to, slow, down, time, highlight, important, moments, and, often, times, build, a, sense, of, suspense, in, a, film, slow, motion, is, a, technique, which, involves, filming, at, a, higher, frame, rate, then, playing, the, footage, again, at, a, normal, speed, this, creates, a, slowed, down, effect, in, the, film, which, can, put, emphasis, on, or, add, fluidity, to, a, scene, on, the, other, hand, fast, motion, is, the, opposite, of, slow, motion, filming, at, a, lower, frame, rate, and, then, playing, the, film, back, at, a, normal, speed, this, creates, a, sped, up, effect, which, can, help, to, emphasize, passage, of, time, or, create, a, sense, of, urgency, time, lapse, is, when, you, take, a, series, of, still, photographs, at, a, regular, interval, over, a, long, period, of, time, from, here, if, you, play, them, back, continuously, a, sped, up, effect, is, shown, time, lapses, are, used, most, effectively, to, show, things, like, sunrises, natural, movement, or, growth, they, are, commonly, used, to, show, passage, of, time, in, a, shorter, sequence, reverse, motion, is, filming, a, scene, normally, then, playing, the, film, in, reverse, this, is, usually, used, to, create, uncommon, surreal, effects, and, create, unusual, scenes, the, various, techniques, involving, speed, all, can, add, to, a, films, intensity, vibe, show, passage, of, time, and, have, many, other, effects, camera, movement, within, a, film, can, play, a, role, in, enhancing, the, visual, quality, and, impact, of, a, film, some, aspects, of, camera, movement, that, contribute, to, this, are, cinematography, can, begin, with, digital, image, sensor, or, rolls, of, film, advancements, in, film, emulsion, and, grain, structure, provided, a, wide, range, of, available, film, stocks, the, selection, of, a, film, stock, is, one, of, the, first, decisions, made, in, preparing, a, typical, film, production, aside, from, the, film, gauge, selection, 8, mm, amateur, 16, mm, semi, professional, 35, mm, professional, and, 65, mm, epic, photography, rarely, used, except, in, special, event, venues, the, cinematographer, has, a, selection, of, stocks, in, reversal, which, when, developed, create, a, positive, image, and, negative, formats, along, with, a, wide, range, of, film, speeds, varying, sensitivity, to, light, from, iso, 50, slow, least, sensitive, to, light, to, 800, very, fast, extremely, sensitive, to, light, and, differing, response, to, color, low, saturation, high, saturation, and, contrast, varying, levels, between, pure, black, no, exposure, and, pure, white, complete, overexposure, advancements, and, adjustments, to, nearly, all, gauges, of, film, create, the, super, formats, wherein, the, area, of, the, film, used, to, capture, a, single, frame, of, an, image, is, expanded, although, the, physical, gauge, of, the, film, remains, the, same, super, 8, mm, super, 16, mm, and, super, 35, mm, all, utilize, more, of, the, overall, film, area, for, the, image, than, their, regular, non, super, counterparts, the, larger, the, film, gauge, the, higher, the, overall, image, resolution, clarity, and, technical, quality, the, techniques, used, by, the, film, laboratory, to, process, the, film, stock, can, also, offer, a, considerable, variance, in, the, image, produced, by, controlling, the, temperature, and, varying, the, duration, in, which, the, film, is, soaked, in, the, development, chemicals, and, by, skipping, certain, chemical, processes, or, partially, skipping, all, of, them, cinematographers, can, achieve, very, different, looks, from, a, single, film, stock, in, the, laboratory, some, techniques, that, can, be, used, are, push, processing, bleach, bypass, and, cross, processing, most, of, modern, cinema, uses, digital, cinematography, and, has, no, film, stocks, but, the, cameras, themselves, can, be, adjusted, in, ways, that, go, far, beyond, the, abilities, of, one, particular, film, stock, they, can, provide, varying, degrees, of, color, sensitivity, image, contrast, light, sensitivity, and, so, on, one, camera, can, achieve, all, the, various, looks, of, different, emulsions, digital, image, adjustments, such, as, iso, and, contrast, are, executed, by, estimating, the, same, adjustments, that, would, take, place, if, actual, film, were, in, use, and, are, thus, vulnerable, to, the, camera, s, sensor, designers, perceptions, of, various, film, stocks, and, image, adjustment, parameters, filters, such, as, diffusion, filters, or, color, effect, filters, are, also, widely, used, to, enhance, mood, or, dramatic, effects, most, photographic, filters, are, made, up, of, two, pieces, of, optical, glass, glued, together, with, some, form, of, image, or, light, manipulation, material, between, the, glass, in, the, case, of, color, filters, there, is, often, a, translucent, color, medium, pressed, between, two, planes, of, optical, glass, color, filters, work, by, blocking, out, certain, color, wavelengths, of, light, from, reaching, the, film, with, color, film, this, works, very, intuitively, wherein, a, blue, filter, will, cut, down, on, the, passage, of, red, orange, and, yellow, light, and, create, a, blue, tint, on, the, film, in, black, and, white, photography, color, filters, are, used, somewhat, counter, intuitively, for, instance, a, yellow, filter, which, cuts, down, on, blue, wavelengths, of, light, can, be, used, to, darken, a, daylight, sky, by, eliminating, blue, light, from, hitting, the, film, thus, greatly, underexposing, the, mostly, blue, sky, while, not, biasing, most, human, flesh, tone, filters, can, be, used, in, front, of, the, lens, or, in, some, cases, behind, the, lens, for, different, effects, certain, cinematographers, such, as, christopher, doyle, are, well, known, for, their, innovative, use, of, filters, doyle, was, a, pioneer, for, increased, usage, of, filters, in, movies, and, is, highly, respected, throughout, the, cinema, world, lenses, can, be, attached, to, the, camera, to, give, a, certain, look, feel, or, effect, by, focus, color, etc, as, does, the, human, eye, the, camera, creates, perspective, and, spatial, relations, with, the, rest, of, the, world, however, unlike, one, s, eye, a, cinematographer, can, select, different, lenses, for, different, purposes, variation, in, focal, length, is, one, of, the, chief, benefits, the, focal, length, of, the, lens, determines, the, angle, of, view, and, therefore, the, field, of, view, cinematographers, can, choose, from, a, range, of, wide, angle, lenses, normal, lenses, and, long, focus, lenses, as, well, as, macro, lenses, and, other, special, effect, lens, systems, such, as, borescope, lenses, wide, angle, lenses, have, short, focal, lengths, and, make, spatial, distances, more, obvious, a, person, in, the, distance, is, shown, as, much, smaller, while, someone, in, the, front, will, loom, large, on, the, other, hand, long, focus, lenses, reduce, such, exaggerations, depicting, far, off, objects, as, seemingly, close, together, and, flattening, perspective, the, differences, between, the, perspective, rendering, is, actually, not, due, to, the, focal, length, by, itself, but, by, the, distance, between, the, subjects, and, the, camera, therefore, the, use, of, different, focal, lengths, in, combination, with, different, camera, to, subject, distances, creates, these, different, rendering, changing, the, focal, length, only, while, keeping, the, same, camera, position, does, not, affect, perspective, but, the, camera, angle, of, view, only, a, zoom, lens, allows, a, camera, operator, to, change, his, focal, length, within, a, shot, or, quickly, between, setups, for, shots, as, prime, lenses, offer, greater, optical, quality, and, are, faster, larger, aperture, openings, usable, in, less, light, than, zoom, lenses, they, are, often, employed, in, professional, cinematography, over, zoom, lenses, certain, scenes, or, even, types, of, filmmaking, however, may, require, the, use, of, zooms, for, speed, or, ease, of, use, as, well, as, shots, involving, a, zoom, move, as, in, other, photography, the, control, of, the, exposed, image, is, done, in, the, lens, with, the, control, of, the, diaphragm, aperture, for, proper, selection, the, cinematographer, needs, that, all, lenses, be, engraved, with, t, stop, not, f, stop, so, that, the, eventual, light, loss, due, to, the, glass, does, not, affect, the, exposure, control, when, setting, it, using, the, usual, meters, the, choice, of, the, aperture, also, affects, image, quality, aberrations, and, depth, of, field, focal, length, and, diaphragm, aperture, affect, the, depth, of, field, of, a, scene, that, is, how, much, the, background, mid, ground, and, foreground, will, be, rendered, in, acceptable, focus, only, one, exact, plane, of, the, image, is, in, precise, focus, on, the, film, or, video, target, depth, of, field, not, to, be, confused, with, depth, of, focus, is, determined, by, the, aperture, size, and, the, focal, distance, a, large, or, deep, depth, of, field, is, generated, with, a, very, small, iris, aperture, and, focusing, on, a, point, in, the, distance, whereas, a, shallow, depth, of, field, will, be, achieved, with, a, large, open, iris, aperture, and, focusing, closer, to, the, lens, depth, of, field, is, also, governed, by, the, format, size, if, one, considers, the, field, of, view, and, angle, of, view, the, smaller, the, image, is, the, shorter, the, focal, length, should, be, as, to, keep, the, same, field, of, view, then, the, smaller, the, image, is, the, more, depth, of, field, is, obtained, for, the, same, field, of, view, therefore, 70mm, has, less, depth, of, field, than, 35mm, for, a, given, field, of, view, 16mm, more, than, 35mm, and, early, video, cameras, as, well, as, most, modern, consumer, level, video, cameras, even, more, depth, of, field, than, 16mm, in, citizen, kane, 1941, cinematographer, gregg, toland, and, director, orson, welles, used, tighter, apertures, to, create, every, detail, of, the, foreground, and, background, of, the, sets, in, sharp, focus, this, practice, is, known, as, deep, focus, deep, focus, became, a, popular, cinematographic, device, from, the, 1940s, onward, in, hollywood, today, the, trend, is, for, more, shallow, focus, to, change, the, plane, of, focus, from, one, object, or, character, to, another, within, a, shot, is, commonly, known, as, a, rack, focus, early, in, the, transition, to, digital, cinematography, the, inability, of, digital, video, cameras, to, easily, achieve, shallow, depth, of, field, due, to, their, small, image, sensors, was, initially, an, issue, of, frustration, for, film, makers, trying, to, emulate, the, look, of, 35mm, film, optical, adapters, were, devised, which, accomplished, this, by, mounting, a, larger, format, lens, which, projected, its, image, at, the, size, of, the, larger, format, on, a, ground, glass, screen, preserving, the, depth, of, field, the, adapter, and, lens, then, mounted, on, the, small, format, video, camera, which, in, turn, focused, on, the, ground, glass, screen, digital, slr, still, cameras, have, sensor, sizes, similar, to, that, of, the, 35mm, film, frame, and, thus, are, able, to, produce, images, with, similar, depth, of, field, the, advent, of, video, functions, in, these, cameras, sparked, a, revolution, in, digital, cinematography, with, more, and, more, film, makers, adopting, still, cameras, for, the, purpose, because, of, the, film, like, qualities, of, their, images, more, recently, more, and, more, dedicated, video, cameras, are, being, equipped, with, larger, sensors, capable, of, 35mm, film, like, depth, of, field, the, aspect, ratio, of, an, image, is, the, ratio, of, its, width, to, its, height, this, can, be, expressed, either, as, a, ratio, of, 2, integers, such, as, 4, 3, or, in, a, decimal, format, such, as, 1, 33, 1, or, simply, 1, 33, different, ratios, provide, different, aesthetic, effects, standards, for, aspect, ratio, have, varied, significantly, over, time, during, the, silent, era, aspect, ratios, varied, widely, from, square, 1, 1, all, the, way, up, to, the, extreme, widescreen, 4, 1, polyvision, however, from, the, 1910s, silent, motion, pictures, generally, settled, on, the, ratio, of, 4, 3, 1, 33, the, introduction, of, sound, on, film, briefly, narrowed, the, aspect, ratio, to, allow, room, for, a, sound, stripe, in, 1932, a, new, standard, was, introduced, the, academy, ratio, of, 1, 37, by, means, of, thickening, the, frame, line, for, years, mainstream, cinematographers, were, limited, to, using, the, academy, ratio, but, in, the, 1950s, thanks, to, the, popularity, of, cinerama, widescreen, ratios, were, introduced, in, an, effort, to, pull, audiences, back, into, the, theater, and, away, from, their, home, television, sets, these, new, widescreen, formats, provided, cinematographers, a, wider, frame, within, which, to, compose, their, images, many, different, proprietary, photographic, systems, were, invented, and, used, in, the, 1950s, to, create, widescreen, movies, but, one, dominated, film, the, anamorphic, process, which, optically, squeezes, the, image, to, photograph, twice, the, horizontal, area, to, the, same, size, vertical, as, standard, spherical, lenses, the, first, commonly, used, anamorphic, format, was, cinemascope, which, used, a, 2, 35, aspect, ratio, although, it, was, originally, 2, 55, cinemascope, was, used, from, 1953, to, 1967, but, due, to, technical, flaws, in, the, design, and, its, ownership, by, fox, several, third, party, companies, led, by, panavision, s, technical, improvements, in, the, 1950s, dominated, the, anamorphic, cine, lens, market, changes, to, smpte, projection, standards, altered, the, projected, ratio, from, 2, 35, to, 2, 39, in, 1970, although, this, did, not, change, anything, regarding, the, photographic, anamorphic, standards, all, changes, in, respect, to, the, aspect, ratio, of, anamorphic, 35, mm, photography, are, specific, to, camera, or, projector, gate, sizes, not, the, optical, system, after, the, widescreen, wars, of, the, 1950s, the, motion, picture, industry, settled, into, 1, 85, as, a, standard, for, theatrical, projection, in, the, united, states, and, the, united, kingdom, this, is, a, cropped, version, of, 1, 37, europe, and, asia, opted, for, 1, 66, at, first, although, 1, 85, has, largely, permeated, these, markets, in, recent, decades, certain, epic, or, adventure, movies, utilized, the, anamorphic, 2, 39, often, incorrectly, denoted, 2, 40, in, the, 1990s, with, the, advent, of, high, definition, video, television, engineers, created, the, 1, 78, 16, 9, ratio, as, a, mathematical, compromise, between, the, theatrical, standard, of, 1, 85, and, television, s, 1, 33, as, it, was, not, practical, to, produce, a, traditional, crt, television, tube, with, a, width, of, 1, 85, until, that, change, nothing, had, ever, been, originated, in, 1, 78, today, this, is, a, standard, for, high, definition, video, and, for, widescreen, television, light, is, necessary, to, create, an, image, exposure, on, a, frame, of, film, or, on, a, digital, target, ccd, etc, the, art, of, lighting, for, cinematography, goes, far, beyond, basic, exposure, however, into, the, essence, of, visual, storytelling, lighting, contributes, considerably, to, the, emotional, response, an, audience, has, watching, a, motion, picture, the, increased, usage, of, filters, can, greatly, impact, the, final, image, and, affect, the, lighting, importance, of, lighting, in, film, lighting, in, film, is, essential, for, three, primary, reasons, visibility, composition, and, mood, firstly, lighting, ensures, that, the, subject, or, scene, is, properly, illuminated, allowing, viewers, to, perceive, the, details, and, understand, the, narrative, it, helps, in, guiding, the, audience, s, attention, to, specific, elements, within, the, frame, highlighting, important, characters, or, objects, secondly, lighting, contributes, to, the, composition, of, a, shot, filmmakers, strategically, place, lights, to, create, balance, depth, and, visual, interest, within, the, frame, it, allows, them, to, control, the, visual, elements, within, the, scene, emphasizing, certain, areas, and, de, emphasizing, others, lastly, lighting, significantly, impacts, the, mood, and, atmosphere, of, a, film, by, manipulating, light, intensity, color, and, direction, filmmakers, can, evoke, different, emotions, and, enhance, the, narrative, bright, even, lighting, may, evoke, a, sense, of, safety, and, happiness, while, low, key, lighting, with, shadows, can, create, tension, mystery, or, fear, the, choice, of, lighting, style, can, also, reflect, the, genre, of, the, film, such, as, the, high, contrast, lighting, commonly, used, in, film, noir, lighting, techniques, numerous, lighting, techniques, are, employed, in, filmmaking, to, achieve, desired, effects, here, are, some, commonly, used, techniques, three, point, lighting, this, classic, technique, involves, the, use, of, three, lights, the, key, light, fill, light, and, backlight, the, key, light, serves, as, the, primary, source, illuminating, the, subject, from, one, side, to, create, depth, and, dimension, the, fill, light, reduces, shadows, caused, by, the, key, light, softening, the, overall, lighting, the, backlight, separates, the, subject, from, the, background, providing, a, halo, effect, and, enhancing, the, sense, of, depth, high, key, lighting, high, key, lighting, produces, a, bright, evenly, lit, scene, often, used, in, comedies, or, light, hearted, films, it, minimizes, shadows, creating, a, cheerful, and, upbeat, atmosphere, low, key, lighting, low, key, lighting, involves, using, a, single, key, light, or, a, few, strategically, placed, lights, to, create, strong, contrasts, and, deep, shadows, this, technique, is, commonly, used, in, film, noir, and, horror, genres, to, evoke, suspense, mystery, or, fear, natural, lighting, filmmakers, sometimes, employ, natural, lighting, to, create, an, authentic, realistic, look, this, technique, utilizes, existing, light, sources, such, as, sunlight, or, practical, lamps, without, additional, artificial, lighting, it, is, often, seen, in, outdoor, scenes, or, films, aiming, for, a, naturalistic, aesthetic, color, lighting, the, use, of, colored, lights, or, gels, can, dramatically, alter, the, mood, and, atmosphere, of, a, scene, different, colors, evoke, different, emotions, and, can, enhance, storytelling, for, example, warm, tones, like, red, or, orange, may, create, a, sense, of, warmth, or, passion, while, cool, tones, like, blue, can, convey, sadness, or, isolation, cinematography, can, not, only, depict, a, moving, subject, but, can, use, a, camera, which, represents, the, audience, s, viewpoint, or, perspective, that, moves, during, the, course, of, filming, this, movement, plays, a, considerable, role, in, the, emotional, language, of, film, images, and, the, audience, s, emotional, reaction, to, the, action, techniques, range, from, the, most, basic, movements, of, panning, horizontal, shift, in, viewpoint, from, a, fixed, position, like, turning, your, head, side, to, side, and, tilting, vertical, shift, in, viewpoint, from, a, fixed, position, like, tipping, your, head, back, to, look, at, the, sky, or, down, to, look, at, the, ground, to, dollying, placing, the, camera, on, a, moving, platform, to, move, it, closer, or, farther, from, the, subject, tracking, placing, the, camera, on, a, moving, platform, to, move, it, to, the, left, or, right, craning, moving, the, camera, in, a, vertical, position, being, able, to, lift, it, off, the, ground, as, well, as, swing, it, side, to, side, from, a, fixed, base, position, and, combinations, of, the, above, early, cinematographers, often, faced, problems, that, were, not, common, to, other, graphic, artists, because, of, the, element, of, motion, cameras, have, been, mounted, to, nearly, every, imaginable, form, of, transportation, most, cameras, can, also, be, handheld, that, is, held, in, the, hands, of, the, camera, operator, who, moves, from, one, position, to, another, while, filming, the, action, personal, stabilizing, platforms, came, into, being, in, the, late, 1970s, through, the, invention, of, garrett, brown, which, became, known, as, the, steadicam, the, steadicam, is, a, body, harness, and, stabilization, arm, that, connects, to, the, camera, supporting, the, camera, while, isolating, it, from, the, operator, s, body, movements, after, the, steadicam, patent, expired, in, the, early, 1990s, many, other, companies, began, manufacturing, their, concept, of, the, personal, camera, stabilizer, this, invention, is, much, more, common, throughout, the, cinematic, world, today, from, feature, length, films, to, the, evening, news, more, and, more, networks, have, begun, to, use, a, personal, camera, stabilizer, the, first, special, effects, in, the, cinema, were, created, while, the, film, was, being, shot, these, came, to, be, known, as, in, camera, effects, later, optical, and, digital, effects, were, developed, so, that, editors, and, visual, effects, artists, could, more, tightly, control, the, process, by, manipulating, the, film, in, post, production, the, 1896, movie, the, execution, of, mary, stuart, shows, an, actor, dressed, as, the, queen, placing, her, head, on, the, execution, block, in, front, of, a, small, group, of, bystanders, in, elizabethan, dress, the, executioner, brings, his, axe, down, and, the, queen, s, severed, head, drops, onto, the, ground, this, trick, was, worked, by, stopping, the, camera, and, replacing, the, actor, with, a, dummy, then, restarting, the, camera, before, the, axe, falls, the, two, pieces, of, film, were, then, trimmed, and, cemented, together, so, that, the, action, appeared, continuous, when, the, film, was, shown, thus, creating, an, overall, illusion, and, successfully, laying, the, foundation, for, special, effects, this, film, was, among, those, exported, to, europe, with, the, first, kinetoscope, machines, in, 1895, and, was, seen, by, georges, m, li, s, who, was, putting, on, magic, shows, in, his, th, tre, robert, houdin, in, paris, at, the, time, he, took, up, filmmaking, in, 1896, and, after, making, imitations, of, other, films, from, edison, lumi, re, and, robert, paul, he, made, escamotage, d, un, dame, chez, robert, houdin, the, vanishing, lady, this, film, shows, a, woman, being, made, to, vanish, by, using, the, same, stop, motion, technique, as, the, earlier, edison, film, after, this, georges, m, li, s, made, many, single, shot, films, using, this, trick, over, the, next, couple, of, years, the, other, basic, technique, for, trick, cinematography, involves, double, exposure, of, the, film, in, the, camera, which, was, first, done, by, george, albert, smith, in, july, 1898, in, the, uk, smith, s, the, corsican, brothers, 1898, was, described, in, the, catalogue, of, the, warwick, trading, company, which, took, up, the, distribution, of, smith, s, films, in, 1900, thus, one, of, the, twin, brothers, returns, home, from, shooting, in, the, corsican, mountains, and, is, visited, by, the, ghost, of, the, other, twin, by, extremely, careful, photography, the, ghost, appears, quite, transparent, after, indicating, that, he, has, been, killed, by, a, sword, thrust, and, appealing, for, vengeance, he, disappears, a, vision, then, appears, showing, the, fatal, duel, in, the, snow, to, the, corsican, s, amazement, the, duel, and, death, of, his, brother, are, vividly, depicted, in, the, vision, and, overcome, by, his, feelings, he, falls, to, the, floor, just, as, his, mother, enters, the, room, the, ghost, effect, was, done, by, draping, the, set, in, black, velvet, after, the, main, action, had, been, shot, and, then, re, exposing, the, negative, with, the, actor, playing, the, ghost, going, through, the, actions, at, the, appropriate, part, likewise, the, vision, which, appeared, within, a, circular, vignette, or, matte, was, similarly, superimposed, over, a, black, area, in, the, backdrop, to, the, scene, rather, than, over, a, part, of, the, set, with, detail, in, it, so, that, nothing, appeared, through, the, image, which, seemed, quite, solid, smith, used, this, technique, again, in, santa, claus, 1898, georges, m, li, s, first, used, superimposition, on, a, dark, background, in, la, caverne, maudite, the, cave, of, the, demons, made, a, couple, of, months, later, in, 1898, and, elaborated, it, with, many, superimpositions, in, the, one, shot, in, un, homme, de, t, tes, the, four, troublesome, heads, he, created, further, variations, in, subsequent, films, motion, picture, images, are, presented, to, an, audience, at, a, constant, speed, in, the, theater, it, is, 24, frames, per, second, in, ntsc, us, television, it, is, 30, frames, per, second, 29, 97, to, be, exact, in, pal, europe, television, it, is, 25, frames, per, second, this, speed, of, presentation, does, not, vary, however, by, varying, the, speed, at, which, the, image, is, captured, various, effects, can, be, created, knowing, that, the, faster, or, slower, recorded, image, will, be, played, at, a, constant, speed, giving, the, cinematographer, even, more, freedom, for, creativity, and, expression, to, be, made, for, instance, time, lapse, photography, is, created, by, exposing, an, image, at, an, extremely, slow, rate, if, a, cinematographer, sets, a, camera, to, expose, one, frame, every, minute, for, four, hours, and, then, that, footage, is, projected, at, 24, frames, per, second, a, four, hour, event, will, take, 10, seconds, to, present, and, one, can, present, the, events, of, a, whole, day, 24, hours, in, just, one, minute, the, inverse, of, this, if, an, image, is, captured, at, speeds, above, that, at, which, they, will, be, presented, the, effect, is, to, greatly, slow, down, slow, motion, the, image, if, a, cinematographer, shoots, a, person, diving, into, a, pool, at, 96, frames, per, second, and, that, image, is, played, back, at, 24, frames, per, second, the, presentation, will, take, 4, times, as, long, as, the, actual, event, extreme, slow, motion, capturing, many, thousands, of, frames, per, second, can, present, things, normally, invisible, to, the, human, eye, such, as, bullets, in, flight, and, shockwaves, travelling, through, media, a, potentially, powerful, cinematographic, technique, in, motion, pictures, the, manipulation, of, time, and, space, is, a, considerable, contributing, factor, to, the, narrative, storytelling, tools, film, editing, plays, a, much, stronger, role, in, this, manipulation, but, frame, rate, selection, in, the, photography, of, the, original, action, is, also, a, contributing, factor, to, altering, time, for, example, charlie, chaplin, s, modern, times, was, shot, at, silent, speed, 18, fps, but, projected, at, sound, speed, 24, fps, which, makes, the, slapstick, action, appear, even, more, frenetic, speed, ramping, or, simply, ramping, is, a, process, whereby, the, capture, frame, rate, of, the, camera, changes, over, time, for, example, if, in, the, course, of, 10, seconds, of, capture, the, capture, frame, rate, is, adjusted, from, 60, frames, per, second, to, 24, frames, per, second, when, played, back, at, the, standard, movie, rate, of, 24, frames, per, second, a, unique, time, manipulation, effect, is, achieved, for, example, someone, pushing, a, door, open, and, walking, out, into, the, street, would, appear, to, start, off, in, slow, motion, but, in, a, few, seconds, later, within, the, same, shot, the, person, would, appear, to, walk, in, realtime, normal, speed, the, opposite, speed, ramping, is, done, in, the, matrix, when, neo, re, enters, the, matrix, for, the, first, time, to, see, the, oracle, as, he, comes, out, of, the, warehouse, load, point, the, camera, zooms, into, neo, at, normal, speed, but, as, it, gets, closer, to, neo, s, face, time, seems, to, slow, down, foreshadowing, the, manipulation, of, time, itself, within, the, matrix, later, in, the, movie, g, a, smith, initiated, the, technique, of, reverse, motion, and, also, improved, the, quality, of, self, motivating, images, this, he, did, by, repeating, the, action, a, second, time, while, filming, it, with, an, inverted, camera, and, then, joining, the, tail, of, the, second, negative, to, that, of, the, first, the, first, films, using, this, were, tipsy, topsy, turvy, and, the, awkward, sign, painter, the, latter, which, showed, a, sign, painter, lettering, a, sign, and, then, the, painting, on, the, sign, vanishing, under, the, painter, s, brush, the, earliest, surviving, example, of, this, technique, is, smith, s, the, house, that, jack, built, made, before, september, 1901, here, a, small, boy, is, shown, knocking, down, a, castle, just, constructed, by, a, little, girl, out, of, children, s, building, blocks, a, title, then, appears, saying, reversed, and, the, action, is, repeated, in, reverse, so, that, the, castle, re, erects, itself, under, his, blows, cecil, hepworth, improved, upon, this, technique, by, printing, the, negative, of, the, forward, motion, backward, frame, by, frame, so, that, in, the, production, of, the, print, the, original, action, was, exactly, reversed, hepworth, made, the, bathers, in, 1900, in, which, bathers, who, have, undressed, and, jumped, into, the, water, appear, to, spring, backward, out, of, it, and, have, their, clothe, magically, fly, back, onto, their, bodies, the, use, of, different, camera, speeds, also, appeared, around, 1900, robert, paul, s, on, a, runaway, motor, car, through, piccadilly, circus, 1899, had, the, camera, turn, so, slowly, that, when, the, film, was, projected, at, the, usual, 16, frames, per, second, the, scenery, appeared, to, be, passing, at, great, speed, cecil, hepworth, used, the, opposite, effect, in, the, indian, chief, and, the, seidlitz, powder, 1901, in, which, a, na, ve, red, indian, eats, a, lot, of, the, fizzy, stomach, medicine, causing, his, stomach, to, expand, and, then, he, then, leaps, around, balloon, like, this, was, done, by, cranking, the, camera, faster, than, the, normal, 16, frames, per, second, giving, the, first, slow, motion, effect, in, descending, order, of, seniority, the, following, staff, is, involved, in, the, film, industry, the, cinematographer, is, responsible, for, the, technical, aspects, of, the, images, lighting, lens, choices, composition, exposure, filtration, film, selection, but, works, closely, with, the, director, to, ensure, that, the, artistic, aesthetics, are, supporting, the, director, s, vision, of, the, story, being, told, the, cinematographers, are, the, heads, of, the, camera, grip, and, lighting, crew, on, a, set, and, for, this, reason, they, are, often, called, directors, of, photography, or, dps, the, american, society, of, cinematographers, defines, cinematography, as, a, creative, and, interpretive, process, that, culminates, in, the, authorship, of, an, original, work, of, art, rather, than, the, simple, recording, of, a, physical, event, cinematography, is, not, a, subcategory, of, photography, rather, photography, is, but, one, craft, that, the, cinematographer, uses, in, addition, to, other, physical, organizational, managerial, interpretive, and, image, manipulating, techniques, to, effect, one, coherent, process, in, british, tradition, if, the, dop, actually, operates, the, camera, him, herself, they, are, called, the, cinematographer, on, smaller, productions, it, is, common, for, one, person, to, perform, all, these, functions, alone, the, career, progression, usually, involves, climbing, up, the, ladder, from, seconding, firsting, eventually, to, operating, the, camera, directors, of, photography, make, many, interpretive, decisions, during, the, course, of, their, work, from, pre, production, to, post, production, all, of, which, affect, the, overall, feel, and, look, of, the, motion, picture, many, of, these, decisions, are, similar, to, what, a, photographer, needs, to, note, when, taking, a, picture, the, cinematographer, controls, the, film, choice, itself, from, a, range, of, available, stocks, with, varying, sensitivities, to, light, and, color, the, selection, of, lens, focal, lengths, aperture, exposure, and, focus, cinematography, however, has, a, temporal, aspect, see, persistence, of, vision, unlike, still, photography, which, is, purely, a, single, still, image, it, is, also, bulkier, and, more, strenuous, to, deal, with, movie, cameras, and, it, involves, a, more, complex, array, of, choices, as, such, a, cinematographer, often, needs, to, work, cooperatively, with, more, people, than, does, a, photographer, who, could, frequently, function, as, a, single, person, as, a, result, the, cinematographer, s, job, also, includes, personnel, management, and, logistical, organization, given, the, in, depth, knowledge, a, cinematographer, requires, not, only, of, his, or, her, own, craft, but, also, that, of, other, personnel, formal, tuition, in, analogue, or, digital, filmmaking, can, be,
