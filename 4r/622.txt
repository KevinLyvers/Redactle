watching, him, with, an, enigmatic, smile, in, various, interviews, fellini, said, that, the, film, s, initial, inspiration, was, the, fashionable, ladies, sack, dress, because, of, what, the, dress, could, hide, beneath, it, brunello, rondi, fellini, s, co, screenwriter, and, long, time, collaborator, confirmed, this, view, explaining, that, the, fashion, of, women, s, sack, dresses, which, possessed, that, sense, of, luxurious, butterflying, out, around, a, body, that, might, be, physically, beautiful, but, not, morally, so, these, sack, dresses, struck, fellini, because, they, rendered, a, woman, very, gorgeous, who, could, instead, be, a, skeleton, of, squalor, and, solitude, inside, credit, for, the, creation, of, steiner, the, intellectual, who, commits, suicide, after, shooting, his, two, children, goes, to, co, screenwriter, tullio, pinelli, having, gone, to, school, with, italian, novelist, cesare, pavese, pinelli, had, closely, followed, the, writer, s, career, and, felt, that, his, over, intellectualism, had, become, emotionally, sterile, leading, to, his, suicide, in, a, turin, hotel, in, 1950, this, idea, of, a, burnt, out, existence, is, carried, over, to, steiner, in, the, party, episode, where, the, sounds, of, nature, are, not, to, be, experienced, first, hand, by, himself, and, his, guests, but, in, the, virtual, world, of, tape, recordings, the, false, miracle, alludes, to, the, 1958, investigation, discounting, the, claims, of, two, children, to, have, been, visited, by, the, madonna, in, a, farm, at, maratta, alta, near, terni, the, dead, sea, monster, alludes, to, the, montesi, affair, in, which, the, dead, body, of, 21, year, old, wilma, montesi, was, discovered, on, a, beach, in, april, 1953, la, dolce, vita, marks, the, first, collaboration, between, fellini, and, mastroianni, on, november, 4, 1977, in, an, interview, on, the, dick, cavett, show, mastroianni, recalled, their, first, encounter, according, to, mastroianni, fellini, told, him, that, the, producer, wanted, paul, newman, for, the, lead, role, but, that, fellini, considered, newman, too, beautiful, while, mastroianni, was, the, face, of, normal, mastroianni, somewhat, embarrassed, requested, to, read, the, script, before, agreeing, to, the, role, i, said, well, ok, i, would, like, to, read, the, script, please, he, said, why, not, ennio, come, with, the, script, i, opened, the, script, and, there, was, nothing, written, blank, pages, then, i, saw, a, sketch, of, the, sea, and, a, man, swimming, with, an, enormous, and, around, his, element, there, was, a, dance, of, mermaids, i, became, green, red, yellow, i, said, well, it, seems, very, interesting, where, do, i, sign, and, that, s, how, i, met, fellini, most, of, the, film, was, shot, at, the, cinecitt, studios, in, rome, set, designer, piero, gherardi, created, over, eighty, locations, including, the, via, veneto, the, dome, of, saint, peter, s, with, the, staircase, leading, up, to, it, and, various, nightclubs, however, other, sequences, were, shot, on, location, such, as, the, party, at, the, aristocrats, castle, filmed, in, the, real, bassano, di, sutri, palace, north, of, rome, some, of, the, servants, waiters, and, guests, were, played, by, real, aristocrats, fellini, combined, constructed, sets, with, location, shots, depending, on, script, requirements, a, real, location, often, gave, birth, to, the, modified, scene, and, consequently, the, newly, constructed, set, the, film, s, last, scenes, where, the, monster, fish, is, pulled, out, of, the, sea, and, marcello, waves, goodbye, to, paola, the, teenage, umbrian, angel, were, shot, on, location, at, passo, oscuro, a, small, resort, town, situated, on, the, italian, coast, 30, kilometers, from, rome, fellini, scrapped, a, major, sequence, that, would, have, involved, the, relationship, of, marcello, with, dolores, an, older, writer, living, in, a, tower, to, be, played, by, 1930s, academy, award, winning, actress, luise, rainer, if, the, director, s, dealings, with, rainer, who, used, to, involve, fellini, in, futile, discussion, were, problematic, biographer, kezich, argues, that, while, rewriting, the, screenplay, the, dolores, character, grew, hyperbolic, and, fellini, decided, to, jettison, the, entire, story, line, the, scene, in, the, trevi, fountain, was, shot, over, a, week, in, winter, in, march, according, to, the, bbc, in, late, january, according, to, anita, ekberg, fellini, claimed, that, ekberg, stood, in, the, cold, water, in, her, dress, for, hours, without, any, trouble, while, mastroianni, had, to, wear, a, wetsuit, beneath, his, clothes, to, no, avail, it, was, only, after, the, actor, polished, off, a, bottle, of, vodka, and, was, completely, pissed, that, fellini, could, shoot, the, scene, the, character, of, paparazzo, the, news, photographer, walter, santesso, was, inspired, by, photojournalist, tazio, secchiaroli, and, is, the, origin, of, the, word, paparazzi, used, in, many, languages, to, describe, intrusive, photographers, as, to, the, origin, of, the, character, s, name, itself, fellini, scholar, peter, bondanella, argues, that, although, it, is, indeed, an, italian, family, name, the, word, is, probably, a, corruption, of, the, word, papataceo, a, large, and, bothersome, mosquito, ennio, flaiano, the, film, s, co, screenwriter, and, creator, of, paparazzo, reports, that, he, took, the, name, from, a, character, in, a, novel, by, george, gissing, gissing, s, character, signor, paparazzo, is, found, in, his, travel, book, by, the, ionian, sea, 1901, marcello, is, a, journalist, in, rome, during, the, late, 1950s, who, covers, tabloid, news, of, movie, stars, religious, visions, and, the, self, indulgent, aristocracy, while, searching, for, a, more, meaningful, way, of, life, marcello, faces, the, existential, struggle, of, having, to, choose, between, two, lives, depicted, by, journalism, and, literature, marcello, leads, a, lifestyle, of, excess, fame, and, pleasure, amongst, rome, s, thriving, popular, culture, depicting, the, confusion, and, frequency, with, which, marcello, gets, distracted, by, women, and, power, a, more, sensitive, marcello, aspires, to, become, a, writer, of, leading, an, intellectual, life, amongst, the, elites, the, poets, writers, and, philosophers, of, the, time, marcello, eventually, chooses, neither, journalism, nor, literature, thematically, he, opted, for, the, life, of, excess, and, popularity, by, officially, becoming, a, publicity, agent, the, theme, of, the, film, is, predominantly, caf, society, the, diverse, and, glittery, world, rebuilt, upon, the, ruins, and, poverty, of, the, italian, postwar, period, in, the, opening, sequence, a, plaster, statue, of, jesus, the, labourer, suspended, by, cables, from, a, helicopter, flies, past, the, ruins, of, an, ancient, roman, aqueduct, the, statue, is, being, taken, to, the, pope, at, the, vatican, journalist, marcello, and, a, photographer, named, paparazzo, follow, in, a, second, helicopter, the, symbolism, of, jesus, arms, outstretched, as, if, blessing, all, of, rome, as, it, flies, overhead, is, soon, replaced, by, the, profane, life, and, neo, modern, architecture, of, the, new, rome, founded, on, the, economic, miracle, of, the, late, 1950s, much, of, this, was, filmed, in, cinecitt, or, in, eur, the, mussolini, style, area, south, of, rome, the, delivery, of, the, statue, is, the, first, of, many, scenes, placing, religious, icons, in, the, midst, of, characters, demonstrating, their, modern, morality, influenced, by, the, booming, economy, and, the, emerging, mass, consumer, life, the, most, common, interpretation, of, the, film, is, a, mosaic, its, parts, linked, by, the, protagonist, marcello, rubini, a, journalist, the, seven, episodes, are, interrupting, the, seven, episodes, is, the, restaurant, sequence, with, the, angelic, paola, they, are, framed, by, a, prologue, jesus, over, rome, and, epilogue, the, monster, fish, giving, the, film, its, innovative, and, symmetrically, symbolic, structure, the, evocations, are, seven, deadly, sins, seven, sacraments, seven, virtues, seven, days, of, creation, other, critics, disagree, peter, bondanella, argues, that, any, critic, of, la, dolce, vita, not, mesmerized, by, the, magic, number, seven, will, find, it, almost, impossible, to, organize, the, numerous, sequences, on, a, strictly, numerological, basis, the, critic, robert, richardson, suggests, that, the, originality, of, la, dolce, vita, lies, in, a, new, form, of, film, narrative, that, mines, an, aesthetic, of, disparity, abandoning, traditional, plot, and, conventional, character, development, fellini, and, co, screenwriters, ennio, flaiano, and, tullio, pinelli, forged, a, cinematic, narrative, that, rejected, continuity, unnecessary, explanations, and, narrative, logic, in, favour, of, seven, non, linear, encounters, between, marcello, a, kind, of, dantesque, pilgrim, and, an, underworld, of, 120, characters, the, encounters, build, up, a, cumulative, impression, on, the, viewer, that, finds, resolution, in, an, overpowering, sense, of, the, disparity, between, what, life, has, been, or, could, be, and, what, it, actually, is, in, a, device, used, earlier, in, his, films, fellini, orders, the, disparate, succession, of, sequences, as, movements, from, evening, to, dawn, also, employed, as, an, ordering, device, is, the, image, of, a, downward, spiral, that, marcello, sets, in, motion, when, descending, the, first, of, several, staircases, including, ladders, that, open, and, close, episodes, the, upshot, is, that, the, film, s, aesthetic, form, rather, than, its, content, embodies, the, theme, of, rome, as, a, moral, wasteland, writing, for, l, espresso, the, italian, novelist, alberto, moravia, highlighted, the, film, s, variations, in, tone, highly, expressive, throughout, fellini, seems, to, change, the, tone, according, to, the, subject, matter, of, each, episode, ranging, from, expressionist, caricature, to, pure, neo, realism, in, general, the, tendency, to, caricature, is, greater, the, more, severe, the, film, s, moral, judgement, although, this, is, never, totally, contemptuous, there, being, always, a, touch, of, complacence, and, participation, as, in, the, final, orgy, scene, or, the, episode, at, the, aristocrats, castle, outside, rome, the, latter, being, particularly, effective, for, its, descriptive, acuteness, and, narrative, rhythm, in, filmcritica, xi, italian, poet, and, film, director, pier, paolo, pasolini, argued, that, la, dolce, vita, was, too, important, to, be, discussed, as, one, would, normally, discuss, a, film, though, not, as, great, as, chaplin, eisenstein, or, mizoguchi, fellini, is, unquestionably, an, author, rather, than, a, director, the, film, is, therefore, his, and, his, alone, the, camera, moves, and, fixes, the, image, in, such, a, way, as, to, create, a, sort, of, diaphragm, around, each, object, thus, making, the, object, s, relationship, to, the, world, appear, as, irrational, and, magical, as, each, new, episode, begins, the, camera, is, already, in, motion, using, complicated, movements, frequently, however, these, sinuous, movements, are, brutally, punctuated, by, a, very, simple, documentary, shot, like, a, quotation, written, in, everyday, language, jacques, doniol, valcroze, film, critic, and, co, founder, of, cahiers, du, cin, ma, felt, that, what, la, dolce, vita, lacks, is, the, structure, of, a, masterpiece, in, fact, the, film, has, no, proper, structure, it, is, a, succession, of, cinematic, moments, some, more, convincing, than, others, in, the, face, of, criticism, la, dolce, vita, disintegrates, leaving, behind, little, more, than, a, sequence, of, events, with, no, common, denominator, linking, them, into, a, meaningful, whole, the, new, york, times, film, critic, bosley, crowther, praised, fellini, s, brilliantly, graphic, estimation, of, a, whole, swath, of, society, in, sad, decay, and, eventually, a, withering, commentary, on, the, tragedy, of, the, over, civilized, fellini, is, nothing, if, not, fertile, fierce, and, urbane, in, calculating, the, social, scene, around, him, and, packing, it, onto, the, screen, he, has, an, uncanny, eye, for, finding, the, offbeat, and, grotesque, incident, the, gross, and, bizarre, occurrence, that, exposes, a, glaring, irony, he, has, too, a, splendid, sense, of, balance, and, a,
