cultural, revolution, these, transformations, were, largely, undone, in, recent, years, peking, opera, has, responded, to, sagging, audience, numbers, by, attempting, reforms, including, improving,

entered, the, oxford, english, dictionary, in, 1953, beijing, opera, is, a, more, recent, equivalent, in, china, the, art, form, has, been, known, by, many, names, at, different, times, and, places, the, earliest, chinese, name, pihuang, was, a, combination, of, the, xipi, and, erhuang, melodies, as, it, increased, in, popularity, its, name, became, jingju, or, jingxi, which, reflected, its, start, in, the, capital, city, chinese, pinyin, j, ng, from, 1927, to, 1949, when, beijing, was, known, as, beiping, peking, opera, was, known, as, pingxi, or, pingju, to, reflect, this, change, finally, with, the, establishment, of, the, people, s, republic, of, china, in, 1949, the, name, of, the, capital, city, was, reverted, to, beijing, and, the, formal, name, of, this, theatre, in, mainland, china, was, established, as, jingju, the, taiwanese, name, for, this, type, of, opera, guoju, or, national, opera, reflects, disputes, over, the, true, seat, of, the, chinese, government, peking, opera, was, born, when, the, four, great, anhui, troupes, brought, hui, opera, or, what, is, now, called, huiju, in, 1790, to, beijing, for, the, eightieth, birthday, of, the, qianlong, emperor, on, 25, september, it, was, originally, staged, for, the, court, and, only, made, available, to, the, public, later, in, 1828, several, famous, hubei, troupes, arrived, in, beijing, and, performed, jointly, with, anhui, troupes, the, combination, gradually, formed, peking, opera, s, melodies, peking, opera, is, generally, regarded, as, having, fully, formed, by, 1845, although, it, is, called, peking, opera, beijing, theatre, style, its, origins, are, in, the, greater, areas, of, the, capital, of, anhui, province, the, city, of, anqing, including, southern, anhui, and, eastern, hubei, which, share, the, similar, dialect, of, xiajiang, mandarin, lower, yangtze, mandarin, peking, opera, s, two, main, melodies, xipi, and, erhuang, xipi, literally, means, skin, puppet, show, referring, to, the, puppet, show, that, originated, in, shaanxi, province, chinese, puppet, shows, always, involve, singing, much, dialogue, is, also, carried, out, in, an, archaic, form, of, mandarin, chinese, in, which, the, zhongyuan, mandarin, dialects, of, henan, and, shaanxi, are, closest, this, form, of, mandarin, is, recorded, in, the, book, zhongyuan, yinyun, it, also, absorbed, music, from, other, operas, and, local, zhili, musical, art, forms, some, scholars, believe, that, the, xipi, musical, form, was, derived, from, the, historic, qinqiang, while, many, conventions, of, staging, performance, elements, and, aesthetic, principles, were, retained, from, kunqu, the, form, that, preceded, it, as, court, art, thus, peking, opera, is, not, a, monolithic, form, but, rather, a, coalescence, of, many, older, forms, however, the, new, form, also, creates, its, own, innovations, the, vocal, requirements, for, all, of, the, major, roles, were, greatly, reduced, for, peking, opera, the, chou, in, particular, rarely, has, a, singing, part, in, peking, opera, unlike, the, equivalent, role, in, kunqu, style, the, melodies, that, accompany, each, play, were, also, simplified, and, are, played, with, different, traditional, instruments, than, in, earlier, forms, perhaps, most, noticeably, true, acrobatic, elements, were, introduced, with, peking, opera, the, form, grew, in, popularity, throughout, the, 19th, century, the, anhui, troupes, reached, their, peak, of, excellence, in, the, middle, of, the, century, and, were, invited, to, perform, in, the, court, of, the, taiping, heavenly, kingdom, that, had, been, established, during, the, taiping, rebellion, beginning, in, 1884, the, empress, dowager, cixi, became, a, regular, patron, of, peking, opera, cementing, its, status, over, earlier, forms, like, kunqu, the, popularity, of, peking, opera, has, been, attributed, to, the, simplicity, of, the, form, with, only, a, few, voices, and, singing, patterns, this, allowed, anyone, to, sing, the, arias, themselves, at, the, time, of, its, growth, in, the, late, nineteenth, century, albums, became, used, to, display, aspects, of, stage, culture, including, makeup, and, costumes, of, performers, peking, opera, was, initially, an, exclusively, male, pursuit, there, were, bans, on, female, performers, and, major, limitations, on, female, audience, members, so, the, art, form, mainly, catered, to, the, tastes, of, male, audience, members, qing, dynasty, emperors, repeatedly, banned, female, performers, beginning, with, kangxi, emperor, in, 1671, the, last, ban, was, by, the, qianlong, emperor, who, banned, all, female, performers, in, beijing, in, 1772, the, appearance, of, women, on, the, stage, began, unofficially, during, the, 1870s, female, performers, began, to, impersonate, male, roles, and, declared, equality, with, men, they, were, given, a, venue, for, their, talents, when, li, maoer, himself, a, former, peking, opera, performer, founded, the, first, female, peking, opera, troupe, in, shanghai, by, 1894, the, first, commercial, venue, showcasing, female, performance, troupes, appeared, in, shanghai, this, encouraged, other, female, troupes, to, form, which, gradually, increased, in, popularity, as, a, result, theatre, artist, yu, zhenting, petitioned, for, the, lifting, of, the, ban, after, the, founding, of, the, republic, of, china, in, 1911, this, was, accepted, and, the, ban, was, lifted, in, 1912, although, male, dan, continued, to, be, popular, after, this, period, after, the, chinese, civil, war, peking, opera, became, a, focal, point, of, identity, for, both, involved, parties, when, the, chinese, communist, party, came, to, power, in, mainland, china, in, 1949, the, newly, formed, government, moved, to, bring, art, into, line, with, communist, ideology, and, to, make, art, and, literature, a, component, of, the, whole, revolutionary, machine, to, this, end, dramatic, works, without, communist, themes, were, considered, subversive, and, were, ultimately, banned, during, the, cultural, revolution, 1966, 1976, the, use, of, opera, as, a, tool, to, transmit, communist, ideology, reached, its, climax, in, the, cultural, revolution, under, the, purview, of, jiang, qing, wife, of, mao, zedong, the, model, operas, were, considered, one, of, the, great, achievements, of, the, cultural, revolution, and, were, meant, to, express, mao, s, view, that, art, must, serve, the, interests, of, the, workers, peasants, and, soldiers, and, must, conform, to, proletarian, ideology, among, the, eight, model, plays, eventually, retained, during, that, time, were, five, peking, operas, notable, among, these, operas, was, the, legend, of, the, red, lantern, which, was, approved, as, a, concert, with, piano, accompaniment, based, on, a, suggestion, from, jiang, qing, performances, of, works, beyond, the, eight, model, plays, were, allowed, only, in, heavily, modified, form, the, endings, of, many, traditional, plays, were, changed, and, visible, stage, assistants, in, peking, opera, were, eliminated, after, the, end, of, the, cultural, revolution, in, the, late, 1970s, traditional, peking, opera, began, to, be, performed, again, peking, opera, and, other, theatrical, art, forms, were, a, controversial, subject, both, before, and, during, the, twelfth, national, people, s, congress, in, 1982, a, study, carried, in, the, people, s, daily, revealed, that, over, 80, percent, of, musical, dramas, staged, in, the, country, were, traditional, plays, from, the, pre, communist, era, as, opposed, to, newly, written, historical, dramas, promoting, socialist, values, in, response, communist, party, officials, enacted, reforms, to, curb, liberalism, and, foreign, influence, in, theatrical, works, after, the, retreat, of, the, republic, of, china, to, taiwan, in, 1949, peking, opera, there, took, on, a, special, status, of, political, symbolism, in, which, the, kuomintang, government, encouraged, the, art, form, over, other, forms, of, performance, in, an, attempt, to, claim, a, position, as, the, sole, representative, of, chinese, culture, this, often, occurred, at, the, expense, of, traditional, taiwanese, opera, due, to, its, status, as, a, prestigious, art, form, with, a, long, history, peking, opera, has, indeed, been, studied, more, and, received, more, monetary, support, than, other, forms, of, theater, in, taiwan, however, there, has, also, been, a, competing, movement, towards, advocating, native, opera, to, differentiate, taiwan, from, the, mainland, in, september, 1990, when, the, kuomintang, government, participated, in, a, state, sponsored, mainland, cultural, event, for, the, first, time, a, taiwanese, opera, group, was, sent, possibly, to, emphasize, taiwaneseness, during, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, peking, opera, witnessed, a, steady, decline, in, audience, numbers, this, has, been, attributed, both, to, a, decrease, in, performance, quality, and, an, inability, of, the, traditional, opera, form, to, capture, modern, life, furthermore, the, archaic, language, of, peking, opera, required, productions, to, use, electronic, subtitles, which, hampered, the, development, of, the, form, the, influence, of, western, culture, has, also, left, the, younger, generations, impatient, with, the, slow, pacing, of, peking, opera, in, response, peking, opera, began, to, see, reform, starting, in, the, 1980s, such, reforms, have, taken, the, form, of, creating, a, school, of, performance, theory, to, increase, performance, quality, employing, modern, elements, to, attract, new, audiences, and, performing, new, plays, outside, of, the, traditional, canon, however, these, reforms, have, been, hampered, by, both, a, lack, of, funding, and, an, adverse, political, climate, that, makes, the, performance, of, new, plays, difficult, in, addition, to, more, formal, reform, measures, peking, opera, troupes, during, the, 1980s, also, adopted, more, unofficial, changes, some, of, those, seen, in, traditional, works, have, been, called, technique, for, technique, s, sake, this, has, included, the, use, of, extended, high, pitch, sequences, by, female, dan, and, the, addition, of, lengthier, movement, sections, and, percussion, sequences, to, traditional, works, such, changes, have, generally, met, with, disdain, from, peking, opera, performers, who, see, them, as, ploys, to, gain, immediate, audience, appeal, plays, with, repetitive, sequences, have, also, been, shortened, to, hold, audience, interest, new, works, have, naturally, experienced, a, greater, freedom, to, experiment, regional, popular, and, foreign, techniques, have, been, adopted, including, western, style, makeup, and, beards, and, new, face, paint, designs, for, jing, characters, the, spirit, of, reform, continued, during, the, 1990s, to, survive, in, an, increasingly, open, market, troupes, like, the, shanghai, peking, opera, company, needed, to, bring, traditional, peking, opera, to, new, audiences, to, do, this, they, have, offered, an, increasing, number, of, free, performances, in, public, areas, there, has, also, been, a, general, feeling, of, a, shift, in, the, creative, attribution, of, peking, opera, works, the, performer, has, traditionally, played, a, large, role, in, the, scripting, and, staging, of, peking, opera, works, however, perhaps, following, the, lead, of, the, west, peking, opera, in, recent, decades, has, shifted, to, a, more, director, and, playwright, centered, model, performers, have, striven, to, introduce, innovation, in, their, work, while, heeding, the, call, for, reform, from, this, new, upper, level, of, peking, opera, producers, channel, cctv, 11, in,

as, the, pantomimic, opening, and, closing, of, doors, and, mounting, and, descending, of, stairs, are, more, readily, apparent, many, performances, deal, with, behaviors, that, occur, in, daily, life, however, in, accordance, with, the, overriding, principle, of, beauty, such, behaviors, are, stylized, to, be, presented, on, stage, peking, opera, does, not, aim, to, accurately, represent, reality, experts, of, the, art, form, contrast, the, principles, of, peking, opera, with, the, principle, of, mo, mimes, or, imitation, that, is, found, in, western, dramas, peking, opera, should, be, suggestive, not, imitative, the, literal, aspects, of, scenes, are, removed, or, stylized, to, better, represent, intangible, emotions, and, characters, the, most, common, stylization, method, in, peking, opera, is, roundness, every, motion, and, pose, is, carefully, manipulated, to, avoid, sharp, angles, and, straight, lines, a, character, looking, upon, an, object, above, them, will, sweep, their, eyes, in, a, circular, motion, from, low, to, high, before, landing, on, the, object, similarly, a, character, will, sweep, their, hand, in, an, arc, from, left, to, right, in, order, to, indicate, an, object, on, the, right, this, avoidance, of, sharp, angles, extends, to, three, dimensional, movement, as, well, reversals, of, orientation, often, take, the, form, of, a, smooth, s, shaped, curve, all, of, these, general, principles, of, aesthetics, are, present, within, other, performance, elements, as, well, peking, opera, stages, have, traditionally, been, square, platforms,

the, audience, on, the, front, part, of, the, stage, traditional, peking, opera, stages, were, built, above, the, line, of, sight, of, the, viewers, but, some, modern, stages, have, been, constructed, with, higher, audience, seating, viewers, are, always, seated, south, of, the, stage, therefore, north, is, the, most, important, direction, in, peking, opera, and, performers, will, immediately, move, to, center, north, upon, entering, the, stage, all, characters, enter, from, the, east, and, exit, from, the, west, in, line, with, the, highly, symbolic, nature, of, peking, opera, the, form, uses, very, few, props, this, reflects, seven, centuries, of, chinese, performance, tradition, the, presence, of, large, objects, is, frequently, indicated, through, conventions, the, stage, will, almost, always, have, a, table, and, at, least, one, chair, which, can, be, turned, through, convention, into, such, diverse, objects, as, a, city, wall, a, mountain, or, a, bed, peripheral, objects, will, often, be, used, to, signify, the, presence, of, a, larger, main, object, for, example, a, whip, is, used, to, indicate, a, horse, and, an, oar, symbolizes, a, boat, the, length, and, internal, structure, of, peking, opera, plays, is, highly, variable, prior, to, 1949, zhezixi, short, plays, or, plays, made, up, of, short, scenes, from, longer, plays, were, often, performed, these, plays,

works, are, marked, by, an, emotional, progression, from, the, beginning, of, the, play, to, the, end, for, example, the, concubine, in, the, one, act, play, the, favorite, concubine, becomes, intoxicated, begins, in, a, state, of, joy, and, then, moves, to, anger, and, jealousy, drunken, playfulness, and, finally, to, a, feeling, of, defeat, and, resignation, a, full, length, play,

scenes, or, scenes, that, involve, protagonists, and, antagonists, there, are, several, major, scenes, within, the, work, that, follow, the, pattern, of, emotional, progression, it, is, these, scenes, that, are, usually, excerpted, for, later, zhezixi, productions, some, of, the, most, complex, plays, may, even, have, an, emotional, progression, from, scene, to, scene, due, to, the, scarcity, of, props, in, peking, opera, costumes, take, on, added, importance, costumes, function, first, to, distinguish, the, rank, of, the, character, being, played, emperors, and, their, families, wear, yellow,

or, moving, vehicles, vocal, production, in, peking, opera, is, conceived, of, as, being, composed, of, four, levels, of, song, songs, with, music, verse, recitation, prose, dialogue, and, non, verbal, vocalizations, the, conception, of, a, sliding, scale, of, vocalization, creates, a, sense, of, smooth, continuity, between, songs, and, speech, the, three, basic, categories, of, vocal, production, technique, are, the, use, of, breath, yongqi, pronunciation, fayin, and, special, peking, opera, pronunciation, shangkouzi, in, chinese, opera, breath, is, based, in, the, pubic, region, and, supported, by, the, abdominal, muscles, performers, follow, the, basic, principle, that, strong, centralized, breath, moves, the, melodic, passages, zhong, qi, xing, xiang, breath, is, visualized, as, being, drawn, up, through, a, central, breathing, cavity, extending, from, the, pubic, region, to, the, top, of, the, head, this, cavity, must, be, under, performers, control, at, all, times, and, they, develop, special, techniques, to, control, both, entering, and, exiting, air, the, two, major, methods, of, taking, in, breath, are, known, as, exchanging, breath, huan, qi, and, stealing, breath, tou, qi, exchanging, breath, is, a, slow, unhurried, process, of, breathing, out, old, air, and, taking, in, new, it, is, used, at, moments, when, the, performer, is, not, under, time, constraint, such, as, during, a, purely, instrumental, musical, passage, or, when, another, character, is, speaking, stealing, breath, is, a, sharp, intake, of, air, without, prior, exhalation, and, is, used, during, long, passages, of, prose, or, song, when, a, pause, would, be, undesirable, both, techniques, should, be, invisible, to, the, audience, and, take, in, only, the, precise, amount, of, air, required, for, the, intended, vocalization, the, most, important, principle, in, exhalation, is, saving, the, breath, cun, qi, breath, should, not, be, expended, all, at, once, at, the, beginning, of, a, spoken, or, sung, passage, but, rather, expelled, slowly, and, evenly, over, its, length, most, songs, and, some, prose, contain, precise, written, intervals, for, when, breath, should, be, exchanged, or, stolen, these, intervals, are, often, marked, by, carats, pronunciation, is, conceptualized, as, shaping, the, throat, and, mouth, into, the, shape, necessary, to, produce, the, desired, vowel, sound, and, clearly, articulating, the, initial, consonant, there, are, four, basic, shapes, for, the, throat, and, mouth, corresponding, to, four, vowel, types, and, five, methods, of, articulating, consonants, one, for, each, type, of, consonant, the, four, throat, and, mouth, shapes, are, opened, mouth, kaikou, level, teeth, qichi, closed, mouth, hekou, or, huokou, and, scooped, lips, cuochun, the, five, consonant, types, are, denoted, by, the, portion, of, the, mouth, most, critical, to, each, type, s, production, throat, or, larynx, hou, tongue, she, molars, or, the, jaws, and, palate, chi, front, teeth, ya, and, lips, chun, some, syllables, written, chinese, characters, have, special, pronunciations, in, peking, opera, this, is, due, to, the, collaboration, with, regional, forms, and, kunqu, that, occurred, during, the, development, of, peking, opera, for, example, meaning, you, may, be, pronounced, li, as, it, is, in, the, anhui, dialect, rather, than, the, standard, chinese, ni, meaning, i, and, pronounced, wo, in, standard, chinese, becomes, ngo, as, it, is, pronounced, in, the, dialect, of, suzhou, in, addition, to, pronunciation, differences, that, are, due, to, the, influence, of, regional, forms, the, readings, of, some, characters, have, been, changed, to, promote, ease, of, performance, or, vocal, variety, for, example, zhi, chi, shi, and, ri, sounds, do, not, carry, well, and, are, difficult, to, sustain, because, they, are, produced, far, back, in, the, mouth, therefore, they, are, performed, with, an, additional, i, sound, as, in, zhii, these, techniques, and, conventions, of, vocal, production, are, used, to, create, the, two, main, categories, of, vocalizations, in, peking, opera, stage, speech, and, song, peking, opera, is, performed, using, both, classical, chinese, and, modern, standard, chinese, with, some, slang, terms, added, for, color, the, social, position, of, the, character, being, played, determines, the, type, of, language, that, is, used, peking, opera, features, three, major, types, of, stage, speech, nianbai, monologues, and, dialogue, which, make, up, the, majority, of, most, plays, consist, of, prose, speeches, the, purpose, of, prose, speech, is, to, advance, the, plot, of, the, play, or, inject, humor, into, a, scene, they, are, usually, short, and, are, performed, mostly, using, vernacular, language, however, as, elizabeth, wichmann, points, out, they, also, have, rhythmic, and, musical, elements, achieved, through, the, stylized, articulation, of, monosyllabic, sound, units, and, the, stylized, pronunciation, of, speech, tones, respectively, prose, speeches, were, frequently, improvised, during, the, early, period, of, peking, opera, s, development, and, chou, performers, carry, on, that, tradition, today, the, second, main, type, of, stage, speech, consists, of, quotations, drawn, from, classical, chinese, poetry, this, type, is, rarely, used, in, peking, opera, plays, have, one, or, two, such, quotations, at, most, and, often, none, at, all, in, most, instances, the, use, of, classical, poetry, is, intended, to, heighten, the, impact, of, a, scene, however, chou, and, more, whimsical, dan, characters, may, misquote, or, misinterpret, the, classical, lines, creating, a, comical, effect, the, final, category, of, stage, speech, is, conventionalized, stage, speeches, chengshi, nianbai, these, are, rigid, formulations, that, mark, important, transition, points, when, a, character, enters, for, the, first, time, an, entrance, speech, shangchang, or, self, introduction, speech, zi, bao, jiamen, is, given, which, includes, a, prelude, poem, a, set, the, scene, poem, and, a, prose, set, the, scene, speech, in, that, order, the, style, and, structure, of, each, entrance, speech, is, inherited, from, earlier, yuan, dynasty, ming, dynasty, folk, and, regional, forms, of, chinese, opera, another, conventionalized, stage, speech, is, the, exit, speech, which, may, take, the, form, of, a, poem, followed, by, a, single, spoken, line, this, speech, is, usually, delivered, by, a, supporting, character, and, describes, their, present, situation, and, state, of, mind, finally, there, is, the, recapitulation, speech, in, which, a, character, will, use, prose, to, recount, the, story, up, to, that, point, these, speeches, came, about, as, a, result, of, the, zhezixi, tradition, of, performing, only, one, part, of, a, larger, play, there, are, six, main, types, of, song, lyrics, in, peking, opera, emotive, condemnatory, narrative, descriptive, disputive, and, shared, space, separate, sensations, lyrics, each, type, uses, the, same, basic, lyrical, structure, differing, only, in, kind, and, degree, of, emotions, portrayed, lyrics, are, written, in, couplets, lian, consisting, of, two, lines, ju, couplets, can, consist, of, two, ten, character, lines, or, two, seven, character, lines, the, lines, are, further, subdivided, into, three, dou, lit, pause, typically, in, a, 3, 3, 4, or, 2, 2, 3, pattern, lines, may, be, padded, with, extra, characters, for, the, purpose, of, clarifying, meaning, rhyme, is, an, extremely, important, device, in, peking, opera, with, thirteen, identified, rhyme, categories, song, lyrics, also, use, the, speech, tones, of, mandarin, chinese, in, ways, that, are, pleasing, to, the, ear, and, convey, proper, meaning, and, emotion, the, first, and, second, of, chinese, s, four, tones, are, normally, known, as, level, ping, tones, in, peking, opera, while, the, third, and, fourth, are, called, oblique, ze, the, closing, line, of, every, couplet, in, a, song, ends, in, a, level, tone, songs, in, peking, opera, are, proscribed, by, a, set, of, common, aesthetic, values, a, majority, of, songs, are, within, a, pitch, range, of, an, octave, and, a, fifth, high, pitch, is, a, positive, aesthetic, value, so, a, performer, will, pitch, songs, at, the, very, top, of, their, vocal, range, for, this, reason, the, idea, of, a, song, s, key, has, value, in, peking, opera, only, as, a, technical, tool, for, the, performer, different, performers, in, the, same, performance, may, sing, in, different, keys, requiring, the, accompanying, musicians, to, constantly, retune, their, instruments, or, switch, out, with, other, players, elizabeth, wichmann, describes, the, ideal, basic, timbre, for, peking, opera, songs, as, a, controlled, nasal, tone, performers, make, extensive, use, of, vocal, vibrato, during, songs, in, a, way, that, is, slower, and, wider, than, vibrato, used, in, western, performances, the, peking, opera, aesthetic, for, songs, is, summed, up, by, the, expression, zi, zheng, qiang, yuan, meaning, that, the, written, characters, should, be, delivered, accurately, and, precisely, and, the, melodic, passages, should, be, weaving, or, round, the, accompaniment, for, a, peking, opera, performance, usually, consists, of, a, small, ensemble, of, traditional, melodic, and, percussion, instruments, the, lead, melodic, instrument, is, the, jinghu, a, small, high, pitched, two, string, spike, fiddle, the, jinghu, is, the, primary, accompaniment, for, performers, during, songs, accompaniment, is, heterophonic, the, jinghu, player, follows, the, basic, contours, of, the, song, s, melody, but, diverges, in, pitch, and, other, elements, the, jinghu, often, plays, more, notes, per, measure, than, the, performer, sings, and, does, so, an, octave, lower, during, rehearsal, the, jinghu, player, adopts, their, own, signature, version, of, the, song, s, melody, but, also, must, adapt, to, spontaneous, improvisations, on, the, part, of, the, performer, due, to, changed, performance, conditions, thus, the, jinghu, player, must, have, an, instinctive, ability, to, change, their, performance, without, warning, to, properly, accompany, the, performer, the, second, is, the, circular, bodied, plucked, lute, the, yueqin, percussion, instruments, include, the, daluo, xiaoluo, and, naobo, the, player, of, the, gu, and, ban, a, small, high, pitch, drum, and, clapper, is, the, conductor, of, the, entire, ensemble, the, two, main, musical, styles, of, peking, opera, xipi, and, erhuang, originally, differed, in, subtle, ways, in, the, xipi, style, the, strings, of, the, jinghu, are, tuned, to, the, keys, of, a, and, d, the, melodies, in, this, style, are, very, disjointed, possibly, reflecting, the, style, s, derivation, from, the, high, and, loud, melodies, of, the, qinqiang, opera, of, northwestern, china, it, is, commonly, used, to, tell, joyous, stories, in, erhuang, on, the, other, hand, the, strings, are, tuned, to, the, keys, of, c, and, g, this, reflects, the, low, soft, and, despondent, folk, tunes, of, south, central, hubei, province, the, style, s, place, of, origin, as, a, result, it, is, used, for, lyrical, stories, both, musical, styles, have, a, standard, meter, of, two, beats, per, bar, the, two, musical, styles, share, six, different, tempos, including, manban, a, slow, tempo, yuanban, a, standard, medium, fast, tempo, kuai, sanyan, leading, beat, daoban, leading, beat, sanban, rubato, beat, and, yaoban, shaking, beat, the, xipi, style, also, uses, several, unique, tempos, including, erliu, two, six, and, kuaiban, a, fast, tempo, of, these, tempos, yuanban, manban, and, kuaiban, are, most, commonly, seen, the, tempo, at, any, given, time, is, controlled, by, a, percussion, player, who, acts, as, director, erhuang, has, been, seen, as, more, improvisational, and, xipi, as, more, tranquil, the, lack, of, defined, standards, among, performance, troupes, and, the, passage, of, time, may, have, made, the, two, styles, more, similar, to, each, other, today, the, melodies, played, by, the, accompaniment, mainly, fall, into, three, broad, categories, the, first, is, the, aria, the, arias, of, peking, opera, can, be, further, divided, into, those, of, the, erhuang, and, xipi, varieties, an, example, of, an, aria, is, wawa, diao, an, aria, in, the, xipi, style, that, is, sung, by, a, young, sheng, to, indicate, heightened, emotion, the, second, type, of, melody, heard, in, peking, opera, is, the, fixed, tune, melody, or, qupai, these, are, instrumental, tunes, that, serve, a, wider, range, of, purposes, than, arias, examples, include, the, water, dragon, tune, shu, l, ng, y, n, which, generally, denotes, the, arrival, of, an, important, person, and, triple, thrust, j, s, n, qi, ng, which, may, signal, a, feast, or, banquet, the, final, type, of, musical, accompaniment, is, the, percussion, pattern, such, patterns, provide, context, to, the, music, in, ways, similar, to, the, fixed, tune, melodies, for, example, there, are, as, many, as, 48, different, percussion, patterns, that, accompany, stage, entrances, each, one, identifies, the, entering, character, by, their, individual, rank, and, personality, the, repertoire, of, peking, opera, includes, nearly, 1, 400, works, the, plays, are, mostly, taken, from, historical, novels, or, traditional, stories, about, civil, political, and, military, struggles, early, plays, were, often, adaptations, from, earlier, chinese, theatre, styles, such, as, kunqu, nearly, half, of, 272, plays, listed, in, 1824, were, derived, from, earlier, styles, many, classification, systems, have, been, used, to, sort, the, plays, two, traditional, methods, have, existed, since, peking, opera, first, appeared, in, china, the, oldest, and, most, generally, used, system, is, to, sort, plays, into, civil, and, martial, types, civil, plays, focus, on, the, relationships, between, characters, and, feature, personal, domestic, and, romantic, situations, the, element, of, singing, is, frequently, used, to, express, emotion, in, this, type, of, play, martial, plays, feature, a, greater, emphasis, on, action, and, combat, skill, the, two, types, of, play, also, feature, different, arrays, of, performers, martial, plays, predominantly, feature, young, sheng, jing, and, chou, while, civil, plays, have, a, greater, need, for, older, roles, and, dan, in, addition, to, being, civil, or, martial, plays, are, also, classified, as, either, daxi, serious, or, xiaoxi, light, the, performance, elements, and, performers, used, in, serious, and, light, plays, greatly, resemble, those, used, in, martial, and, civil, plays, respectively, of, course, the, aesthetic, principle, of, synthesis, frequently, leads, to, the, use, of, these, contrasting, elements, in, combination, yielding, plays, that, defy, such, dichotomous, classification, since, 1949, a, more, detailed, classification, system, has, been, put, into, use, based, on, thematic, content, and, the, historical, period, of, a, play, s, creation, the, first, category, in, this, system, is, chuantongxi, traditional, plays, that, were, in, performance, before, 1949, the, second, category, is, xinbian, de, lishixi, historical, plays, written, after, 1949, this, type, of, play, was, not, produced, at, all, during, the, cultural, revolution, but, is, a, major, focus, today, the, final, category, is, xiandaixi,
