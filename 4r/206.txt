of, dean, moriarty, kerouac, often, based, his, fictional, characters, on, friends, and, family, because, of, the, objections, of, my, early, publishers, i, was, not, allowed, to, use, the, same, personae, names, in, each, work, on, the, road, received, mixed, critical, reactions, upon, its, publication, in, 1957, while, some, early, reviewers, of, the, book, spoke, favorably, of, it, the, backlash, to, these, reviews, was, swift, and, strong, since, its, publication, critical, attention, has, focused, on, issues, of, both, the, context, and, the, style, addressing, the, actions, of, the, characters, as, well, as, the, nature, of, kerouac, s, prose, in, his, review, for, the, new, york, times, gilbert, millstein, wrote, its, publication, is, a, historic, occasion, in, so, far, as, the, exposure, of, an, authentic, work, of, art, is, of, any, great, moment, in, an, age, in, which, the, attention, is, fragmented, and, the, sensibilities, are, blunted, by, the, superlatives, of, fashion, and, praised, it, as, a, major, novel, millstein, was, already, sympathetic, toward, the, beat, generation, and, his, promotion, of, the, book, in, the, times, did, wonders, for, its, recognition, and, acclaim, not, only, did, he, like, the, themes, but, also, the, style, which, would, come, to, be, just, as, hotly, contested, in, the, reviews, that, followed, there, are, sections, of, on, the, road, in, which, the, writing, is, of, a, beauty, almost, breathtaking, there, is, some, writing, on, jazz, that, has, never, been, equaled, in, american, fiction, either, for, insight, style, or, technical, virtuosity, kerouac, and, joyce, johnson, a, younger, writer, he, was, living, with, read, the, review, shortly, after, midnight, at, a, newsstand, at, 69th, street, and, broadway, near, joyce, s, apartment, in, the, upper, west, side, they, took, their, copy, of, the, newspaper, to, a, neighborhood, bar, and, read, the, review, over, and, over, jack, kept, shaking, his, head, joyce, remembered, later, in, her, memoir, minor, characters, as, if, he, couldn, t, figure, out, why, he, wasn, t, happier, than, he, was, finally, they, returned, to, her, apartment, to, go, to, sleep, as, joyce, recalled, jack, lay, down, obscure, for, the, last, time, in, his, life, the, ringing, phone, woke, him, the, next, morning, and, he, was, famous, a, backlash, began, a, few, days, later, in, the, same, publication, david, dempsey, published, a, review, that, contradicted, most, of, what, millstein, had, promoted, in, the, book, as, a, portrait, of, a, disjointed, segment, of, society, acting, out, of, its, own, neurotic, necessity, on, the, road, is, a, stunning, achievement, but, it, is, a, road, as, far, as, the, characters, are, concerned, that, leads, to, nowhere, while, he, did, not, discount, the, stylistic, nature, of, the, text, saying, that, it, was, written, with, great, relish, he, dismissed, the, content, as, a, passionate, lark, rather, than, a, novel, other, reviewers, were, also, less, than, impressed, phoebe, lou, adams, in, atlantic, monthly, wrote, that, it, disappoints, because, it, constantly, promises, a, revelation, or, a, conclusion, of, real, importance, and, general, applicability, and, cannot, deliver, any, such, conclusion, because, dean, is, more, convincing, as, an, eccentric, than, as, a, representative, of, any, segment, of, humanity, while, she, liked, the, writing, and, found, a, good, theme, her, concern, was, repetition, everything, mr, kerouac, has, to, say, about, dean, has, been, told, in, the, first, third, of, the, book, and, what, comes, later, is, a, series, of, variations, on, the, same, theme, robert, kirsch, in, the, los, angeles, times, said, mr, kerouac, may, one, day, be, a, good, writer, but, that, day, will, come, when, he, stops, riding, around, in, a, compulsive, search, for, material, and, settles, down, to, learn, some, of, the, first, things, about, the, craft, mr, kerouac, calls, this, the, beat, generation, but, a, much, more, accurate, description, would, be, the, deadbeat, generation, i, don, t, know, whether, such, people, really, exist, but, if, they, do, he, has, thoroughly, failed, to, make, them, believable, the, review, from, time, exhibited, a, similar, sentiment, the, post, world, war, ii, generation, beat, or, beatific, has, not, found, symbolic, spokesmen, with, anywhere, near, the, talents, of, fitzgerald, hemingway, or, nathanael, west, in, this, novel, talented, author, kerouac, 35, does, not, join, that, literary, league, either, but, at, least, suggests, that, his, generation, is, not, silent, with, his, barbaric, yawp, of, a, book, kerouac, commands, attention, as, a, kind, of, literary, james, dean, it, considers, the, book, partly, a, travel, book, and, partly, a, collection, of, journal, jottings, while, kerouac, sees, his, characters, as, mad, to, live, desirous, of, everything, at, the, same, time, the, reviewer, likens, them, to, cases, of, psychosis, that, is, a, variety, of, ganser, syndrome, who, aren, t, really, mad, they, only, seem, to, be, thomas, pynchon, described, on, the, road, as, one, of, the, great, american, novels, on, the, road, has, been, the, object, of, critical, study, since, its, publication, david, brooks, of, the, new, york, times, compiled, several, opinions, and, summarized, them, in, an, op, ed, from, october, 2, 2007, whereas, millstein, saw, it, as, a, story, in, which, the, heroes, took, pleasure, in, everything, george, mouratidis, an, editor, of, a, new, edition, claimed, above, all, else, the, story, is, about, loss, it, s, a, book, about, death, and, the, search, for, something, meaningful, to, hold, on, to, the, famous, search, for, it, a, truth, larger, than, the, self, which, of, course, is, never, found, wrote, meghan, o, rourke, in, slate, kerouac, was, this, deep, lonely, melancholy, man, hilary, holladay, of, the, university, of, massachusetts, lowell, told, the, philadelphia, inquirer, and, if, you, read, the, book, closely, you, see, that, sense, of, loss, and, sorrow, swelling, on, every, page, in, truth, on, the, road, is, a, book, of, broken, dreams, and, failed, plans, wrote, ted, gioia, in, the, weekly, standard, john, leland, author, of, why, kerouac, matters, the, lessons, of, on, the, road, they, re, not, what, you, think, said, we, re, no,

the, search, for, revelation, are, timeless, these, are, as, elusive, and, precious, in, our, time, as, in, sal, s, and, will, be, when, our, grandchildren, celebrate, the, book, s, hundredth, anniversary, to, brooks, this, characterization, seemed, limited, reading, through, the, anniversary, commemorations, you, feel, the, gravitational, pull, of, the, great, boomer, narcissus, all,

exuberance, now, becomes, a, gloomy, middle, aged, disillusion, he, lamented, that, the, book, s, spirit, seems, to, have, been, tamed, by, the, professionalism, of, america, today, and, how, it, has, only, survived, in, parts, the, more, reckless, and, youthful, parts, of, the, text, that, gave, it, its, energy, are, the, parts, that, have, run, afoul, of, the, new, gentility, the, rules, laid, down, by, the, health, experts, childcare, experts, guidance, counselors, safety, advisers, admissions, officers, virtuecrats, and, employers, to, regulate, the, lives, of, the, young, he, claims,

male, identity, kerouac, s, writing, style, has, attracted, the, attention, of, critics, on, the, road, has, been, considered, by, tim, hunt, to, be, a, transitional, phase, between, the, traditional, narrative, structure, of, the, town, and, the, city, 1951, and, the, wild, form, of, his, later, books, like, visions, of, cody, 1972, kerouac, s, own, explanation, of, his, style, in, essentials, of, spontaneous, prose, 1953, is, that, his, writing, is, like, the, impressionist, painters, who, sought, to, create, art, through, direct, observation, matt, theado, feels, he, endeavored, to, present, a, raw, version, of, truth, which, did, not, lend, itself, to, the, traditional, process, of, revision, and, rewriting, but, rather, the, emotionally, charged, practice, of, the, spontaneity, he, pursued, theado, argues, that, the, personal, nature, of, the, text, helps, foster, a, direct, link, between, kerouac, and, the, reader, that, his, casual, diction, and, very, relaxed, syntax, was, an, intentional, attempt, to, depict, events, as, they, happened, and, to, convey, all, of, the, energy, and, emotion, of, the, experiences, music, is, an, important, part, of, the, scene, that,

with, miles, davis, and, as, i, sat, there, listening, to, that, sound, of, the, night, which, bop, has, come, to, represent, for, all, of, us, i, thought, of, all, my, friends, from, one, end, of,
