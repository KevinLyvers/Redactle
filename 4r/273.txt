an, inquiry, into, the, nature, and, causes, of, the, wealth, of, nations, generally, referred, to, by, its, shortened, title, the, wealth, of, nations, is, the, magnum, opus, of, the, scottish, economist, and, moral, philosopher, adam, smith, 1723, 1790, first, published, in, 1776, the, book, offers, one, of, the, world, s, first, connected, accounts, of, what, builds, nations, wealth, and, has, become, a, fundamental, work, in, classical, economics, reflecting, upon, economics, at, the, beginning, of, the, industrial, revolution, smith, addresses, topics, such, as, the, division, of, labour, productivity, and, free, markets, the, wealth, of, nations, was, published, in, two, volumes, on, 9, march, 1776, with, books, i, iii, included, in, the, first, volume, and, books, iv, and, v, included, in, the, second, during, the, scottish, enlightenment, and, the, scottish, agricultural, revolution, it, influenced, several, authors, and, economists, such, as, karl, marx, as, well, as, governments, and, organizations, setting, the, terms, for, economic, debate, and, discussion, for, the, next, century, and, a, half, for, example, alexander, hamilton, was, influenced, in, part, by, the, wealth, of, nations, to, write, his, report, on, manufactures, in, which, he, argued, against, many, of, smith, s, policies, hamilton, based, much, of, this, report, on, the, ideas, of, jean, baptiste, colbert, and, it, was, in, part, colbert, s, ideas, that, smith, responded, to, and, criticised, with, the, wealth, of, nations, the, wealth, of, nations, was, the, product, of, seventeen, years, of, notes, and, earlier, studies, as, well, as, an, observation, of, conversation, among, economists, of, the, time, like, nicholas, magens, concerning, economic, and, societal, conditions, during, the, beginning, of, the, industrial, revolution, and, it, took, smith, some, ten, years, to, produce, the, result, was, a, treatise, which, sought, to, offer, a, practical, application, for, reformed, economic, theory, to, replace, the, mercantilist, and, physiocratic, economic, theories, that, were, becoming, less, relevant, in, the, time, of, industrial, progress, and, innovation, it, provided, the, foundation, for, economists, politicians, mathematicians, and, thinkers, of, all, fields, to, build, upon, irrespective, of, historical, influence, the, wealth, of, nations, represented, a, clear, paradigm, shift, in, the, field, of, economics, comparable, to, what, immanuel, kant, s, critique, of, pure, reason, was, for, philosophy, five, editions, of, the, wealth, of, nations, were, published, during, smith, s, lifetime, in, 1776, 1778, 1784, 1786, and, 1789, numerous, editions, appeared, after, smith, s, death, in, 1790, to, better, understand, the, evolution, of, the, work, under, smith, s, hand, a, team, led, by, edwin, cannan, collated, the, first, five, editions, the, differences, were, published, along, with, an, edited, sixth, edition, in, 1904, they, found, minor, but, numerous, differences, including, the, addition, of, many, footnotes, between, the, first, and, the, second, editions, the, differences, between, the, second, and, third, editions, are, major, in, 1784, smith, annexed, these, first, two, editions, with, the, publication, of, additions, and, corrections, to, the, first, and, second, editions, of, dr, adam, smith, s, inquiry, into, the, nature, and, causes, of, the, wealth, of, nations, and, he, also, had, published, the, three, volume, third, edition, of, the, wealth, of, nations, which, incorporated, additions, and, corrections, and, for, the, first, time, an, index, among, other, things, the, additions, and, corrections, included, entirely, new, sections, particularly, to, book, 4, chapters, 4, and, 5, and, to, book, 5, chapter, 1, as, well, as, an, additional, chapter, 8, conclusion, of, the, mercantile, system, in, book, 4, the, fourth, edition, published, in, 1786, had, only, slight, differences, from, the, third, edition, and, smith, himself, says, in, the, advertisement, at, the, beginning, of, the, book, i, have, made, no, alterations, of, any, kind, finally, cannan, notes, only, trivial, differences, between, the, fourth, and, fifth, editions, a, set, of, misprints, being, removed, from, the, fourth, and, a, different, set, of, misprints, being, introduced, of, the, division, of, labour, division, of, labour, has, caused, a, greater, increase, in, production, than, any, other, factor, this, diversification, is, greatest, for, nations, with, more, industry, and, improvement, and, is, responsible, for, universal, opulence, in, those, countries, this, is, in, part, due, to, increased, quality, of, production, but, more, importantly, because, of, increased, efficiency, of, production, leading, to, a, higher, nominal, output, of, units, produced, per, time, unit, agriculture, is, less, amenable, than, manufacturing, to, division, of, labour, hence, rich, nations, are, not, so, far, ahead, of, poor, nations, in, agriculture, as, in, manufacturing, of, the, principle, which, gives, occasion, to, the, division, of, labour, division, of, labour, arises, not, from, innate, wisdom, but, from, humans, propensity, to, barter, that, the, division, of, labour, is, limited, by, the, extent, of, the, market, limited, opportunity, for, exchange, discourages, division, of, labour, because, water, carriage, i, e, transportation, extends, the, market, division, of, labour, with, its, improvements, comes, earliest, to, cities, near, waterways, civilization, began, around, the, highly, navigable, mediterranean, sea, of, the, origin, and, use, of, money, with, division, of, labour, the, produce, of, one, s, own, labour, can, fill, only, a, small, part, of, one, s, needs, different, commodities, have, served, as, a, common, medium, of, exchange, but, all, nations, have, finally, settled, on, metals, which, are, durable, and, divisible, for, this, purpose, before, coinage, people, had, to, weigh, and, assay, with, each, exchange, or, risk, the, grossest, frauds, and, impositions, thus, nations, began, stamping, metal, on, one, side, only, to, ascertain, purity, or, on, all, sides, to, stipulate, purity, and, amount, the, quantity, of, real, metal, in, coins, has, diminished, due, to, the, avarice, and, injustice, of, princes, and, sovereign, states, enabling, them, to, pay, their, debts, in, appearance, only, and, to, the, defraudment, of, creditors, of, the, wages, of, labour, in, this, section, smith, describes, how, the, wages, of, labour, are, dictated, primarily, by, the, competition, among, labourers, and, masters, when, labourers, bid, against, one, another, for, limited, employment, opportunities, the, wages, of, labour, collectively, fall, whereas, when, employers, compete, against, one, another, for, limited, supplies, of, labour, the, wages, of, labour, collectively, rise, however, this, process, of, competition, is, often, circumvented, by, combinations, among, labourers, and, among, masters, when, labourers, combine, and, no, longer, bid, against, one, another, their, wages, rise, whereas, when, masters, combine, wages, fall, in, smith, s, day, organised, labour, was, dealt, with, very, harshly, by, the, law, smith, himself, wrote, about, the, severity, of, such, laws, against, worker, actions, and, made, a, point, to, contrast, the, clamour, of, the, masters, against, workers, associations, while, associations, and, collusions, of, the, masters, are, never, heard, by, the, people, though, such, actions, are, always, and, everywhere, taking, place, we, rarely, hear, it, has, been, said, of, the, combinations, of, masters, though, frequently, of, those, of, workmen, but, whoever, imagines, upon, this, account, that, masters, rarely, combine, is, as, ignorant, of, the, world, as, of, the, subject, masters, are, always, and, everywhere, in, a, sort, of, tacit, but, constant, and, uniform, combination, not, to, raise, the, wages, of, labour, above, their, actual, rate, masters, too, sometimes, enter, into, particular, combinations, to, sink, the, wages, of, labour, even, below, this, rate, these, are, always, conducted, with, the, utmost, silence, and, secrecy, till, the, moment, of, execution, and, when, the, workmen, yield, as, they, sometimes, do, without, resistance, though, severely, felt, by, them, they, are, never, heard, of, by, other, people, in, contrast, when, workers, combine, the, masters, never, cease, to, call, aloud, for, the, assistance, of, the, civil, magistrate, and, the, rigorous, execution, of, those, laws, which, have, been, enacted, with, so, much, severity, against, the, combination, of, servants, labourers, and, journeymen, in, societies, where, the, amount, of, labour, exceeds, the, amount, of, revenue, available, for, waged, labour, competition, among, workers, is, greater, than, the, competition, among, employers, and, wages, fall, conversely, where, revenue, is, abundant, labour, wages, rise, smith, argues, that, therefore, labour, wages, only, rise, as, a, result, of, greater, revenue, disposed, to, pay, for, labour, smith, thought, of, labour, as, being, like, any, other, commodity, in, this, respect, the, demand, for, men, like, that, for, any, other, commodity, necessarily, regulates, the, production, of, men, quickens, it, when, it, goes, on, too, slowly, and, stops, it, when, it, advances, too, fast, it, is, this, demand, which, regulates, and, determines, the, state, of, propagation, in, all, the, different, countries, of, the, world, in, north, america, in, europe, and, in, china, which, renders, it, rapidly, progressive, in, the, first, slow, and, gradual, in, the, second, and, altogether, stationary, in, the, last, however, the, amount, of, revenue, must, increase, constantly, in, proportion, to, the, amount, of, labour, for, wages, to, remain, high, smith, illustrates, this, by, juxtaposing, england, with, the, north, american, colonies, in, england, there, is, more, revenue, than, in, the, colonies, but, wages, are, lower, because, more, workers, flock, to, new, employment, opportunities, caused, by, the, large, amount, of, revenue, so, workers, eventually, compete, against, each, other, as, much, as, they, did, before, by, contrast, as, capital, continues, to, flow, to, the, colonial, economies, at, least, at, the, same, rate, that, population, increases, to, fill, out, this, excess, capital, wages, there, stay, higher, than, in, england, smith, was, highly, concerned, about, the, problems, of, poverty, he, writes, poverty, though, it, does, not, prevent, the, generation, is, extremely, unfavourable, to, the, rearing, of, children, it, is, not, uncommon, in, the, highlands, of, scotland, for, a, mother, who, has, borne, twenty, children, not, to, have, two, alive, in, some, places, one, half, the, children, born, die, before, they, are, four, years, of, age, in, many, places, before, they, are, seven, and, in, almost, all, places, before, they, are, nine, or, ten, this, great, mortality, however, will, every, where, be, found, chiefly, among, the, children, of, the, common, people, who, cannot, afford, to, tend, them, with, the, same, care, as, those, of, better, station, the, only, way, to, determine, whether, a, man, is, rich, or, poor, is, to, examine, the, amount, of, labour, he, can, afford, to, purchase, labour, is, the, real, exchange, for, commodities, smith, also, describes, the, relation, of, cheap, years, and, the, production, of, manufactures, versus, the, production, in, dear, years, he, argues, that, while, some, examples, such, as, the, linen, production, in, france, show, a, correlation, another, example, in, scotland, shows, the, opposite, he, concludes, that, there, are, too, many, variables, to, make, any, statement, about, this, of, the, profits, of, stock, in, this, chapter, smith, uses, interest, rates, as, an, indicator, of, the, profits, of, stock, this, is, because, interest, can, only, be, paid, with, the, profits, of, stock, and, so, creditors, will, be, able, to, raise, rates, in, proportion, to, the, increase, or, decrease, of, the, profits, of, their, debtors, smith, argues, that, the, profits, of, stock, are, inversely, proportional, to, the, wages, of, labour, because, as, more, money, is, spent, compensating, labour, there, is, less, remaining, for, personal, profit, it, follows, that, in, societies, where, competition, among, labourers, is, greatest, relative, to, competition, among, employers, profits, will, be, much, higher, smith, illustrates, this, by, comparing, interest, rates, in, england, and, scotland, in, england, government, laws, against, usury, had, kept, maximum, interest, rates, very, low, but, even, the, maximum, rate, was, believed, to, be, higher, than, the, rate, at, which, money, was, usually, loaned, in, scotland, however, interest, rates, are, much, higher, this, is, the, result, of, a, greater, proportion, of, capitalists, in, england, which, offsets, some, competition, among, labourers, and, raises, wages, however, smith, notes, that, curiously, interest, rates, in, the, colonies, are, also, remarkably, high, recall, that, in, the, previous, chapter, smith, described, how, wages, in, the, colonies, are, higher, than, in, england, smith, attributes, this, to, the, fact, that, when, an, empire, takes, control, of, a, colony, prices, for, a, huge, abundance, of, land, and, resources, are, extremely, cheap, this, allows, capitalists, to, increase, their, profits, but, simultaneously, draws, many, capitalists, to, the, colonies, increasing, the, wages, of, labour, as, this, is, done, however, the, profits, of, stock, in, the, mother, country, rise, or, at, least, cease, to, fall, as, much, of, it, has, already, flocked, offshore, of, wages, and, profit, in, the, different, employments, of, labour, and, stock, smith, repeatedly, attacks, groups, of, politically, aligned, individuals, who, attempt, to, use, their, collective, influence, to, manipulate, the, government, into, doing, their, bidding, at, the, time, these, were, referred, to, as, factions, but, are, now, more, commonly, called, special, interests, a, term, that, can, comprise, international, bankers, corporate, conglomerations, outright, oligopolies, trade, unions, and, other, groups, indeed, smith, had, a, particular, distrust, of, the, tradesman, class, he, felt, that, the, members, of, this, class, especially, acting, together, within, the, guilds, they, want, to, form, could, constitute, a, power, block, and, manipulate, the, state, into, regulating, for, special, interests, against, the, general, interest, people, of, the, same, trade, seldom, meet, together, even, for, merriment, and, diversion, but, the, conversation, ends, in, a, conspiracy, against, the, public, or, in, some, contrivance, to, raise, prices, it, is, impossible, indeed, to, prevent, such, meetings, by, any, law, which, either, could, be, executed, or, would, be, consistent, with, liberty, and, justice, but, though, the, law, cannot, hinder, people, of, the, same, trade, from, sometimes, assembling, together, it, ought, to, do, nothing, to, facilitate, such, assemblies, much, less, to, render, them, necessary, smith, also, argues, against, government, subsidies, of, certain, trades, because, this, will, draw, many, more, people, to, the, trade, than, what, would, otherwise, be, normal, collectively, lowering, their, wages, of, the, rent, of, the, land, chapter, 10, part, ii, motivates, an, understanding, of, the, idea, of, feudalism, rent, considered, as, the, price, paid, for, the, use, of, land, is, naturally, the, highest, the, tenant, can, afford, in, the, actual, circumstances, of, the, land, in, adjusting, lease, terms, the, landlord, endeavours, to, leave, him, no, greater, share, of, the, produce, than, what, is, sufficient, to, keep, up, the, stock, from, which, he, furnishes, the, seed, pays, the, labour, and, purchases, and, maintains, the, cattle, and, other, instruments, of, husbandry, together, with, the, ordinary, profits, of, farming, stock, in, the, neighbourhood, this, is, evidently, the, smallest, share, with, which, the, tenant, can, content, himself, without, being, a, loser, and, the, landlord, seldom, means, to, leave, him, any, more, whatever, part, of, the, produce, or, what, is, the, same, thing, whatever, part, of, its, price, is, over, and, above, this, share, he, naturally, endeavours, to, reserve, to, himself, as, the, rent, of, his, land, which, is, evidently, the, highest, the, tenant, can, afford, to, pay, in, the, actual, circumstances, of, the, land, sometimes, indeed, the, liberality, more, frequently, the, ignorance, of, the, landlord, makes, him, accept, of, somewhat, less, than, this, portion, and, sometimes, too, though, more, rarely, the, ignorance, of, the, tenant, makes, him, undertake, to, pay, somewhat, more, or, to, content, himself, with, somewhat, less, than, the, ordinary, profits, of, farming, stock, in, the, neighbourhood, this, portion, however, may, still, be, considered, as, the, natural, rent, of, land, or, the, rent, for, which, it, is, naturally, meant, that, land, should, for, the, most, part, be, let, of, the, division, of, stock, when, the, stock, which, a, man, possesses, is, no, more, than, sufficient, to, maintain, him, for, a, few, days, or, a, few, weeks, he, seldom, thinks, of, deriving, any, revenue, from, it, he, consumes, it, as, sparingly, as, he, can, and, endeavours, by, his, labour, to, acquire, something, which, may, supply, its, place, before, it, be, consumed, altogether, his, revenue, is, in, this, case, derived, from, his, labour, only, this, is, the, state, of, the, greater, part, of, the, labouring, poor, in, all, countries, but, when, he, possesses, stock, sufficient, to, maintain, him, for, months, or, years, he, naturally, endeavours, to, derive, a, revenue, from, the, greater, part, of, it, reserving, only, so, much, for, his, immediate, consumption, as, may, maintain, him, till, this, revenue, begins, to, come, in, his, whole, stock, therefore, is, distinguished, into, two, parts, that, part, which, he, expects, is, to, afford, him, this, revenue, is, called, his, capital, of, money, considered, as, a, particular, branch, of, the, general, stock, of, the, society, from, references, of, the, first, book, that, the, price, of, the, greater, part, of, commodities, resolves, itself, into, three, parts, of, which, one, pays, the, wages, of, the, labour, another, the, profits, of, the, stock, and, a, third, the, rent, of, the, land, which, had, been, employed, in, producing, and, bringing, them, to, market, that, there, are, indeed, some, commodities, of, which, the, price, is, made, up, of, two, of, those, parts, only, the, wages, of, labour, and, the, profits, of, stock, and, a, very, few, in, which, it, consists, altogether, in, one, the, wages, of, labour, but, that, the, price, of, every, commodity, necessarily, resolves, itself, into, some, one, or, other, or, all, of, these, three, parts, every, part, of, it, which, goes, neither, to, rent, nor, to, wages, being, necessarily, profit, to, somebody, of, the, accumulation, of, capital, or, of, productive, and, unproductive, labour, one, sort, of, labour, adds, to, the, value, of, the, subject, upon, which, it, is, bestowed, there, is, another, which, has, no, such, effect, the, former, as, it, produces, a, value, may, be, called, productive, the, latter, unproductive, labour, thus, the, labour, of, a, manufacturer, adds, generally, to, the, value, of, the, materials, which, he, works, upon, that, of, his, own, maintenance, and, of, his, master, s, profit, the, labour, of, a, menial, servant, on, the, contrary, adds, to, the, value, of, nothing, of, stock, lent, at, interest, the, stock, which, is, lent, at, interest, is, always, considered, as, a, capital, by, the, lender, he, expects, that, in, due, time, it, is, to, be, restored, to, him, and, that, in, the, meantime, the, borrower, is, to, pay, him, a, certain, annual, rent, for, the, use, of, it, the, borrower, may, use, it, either, as, a, capital, or, as, a, stock, reserved, for, immediate, consumption, if, he, uses, it, as, a, capital, he, employs, it, in, the, maintenance, of, productive, labourers, who, reproduce, the, value, with, a, profit, he, can, in, this, case, both, restore, the, capital, and, pay, the, interest, without, alienating, or, encroaching, upon, any, other, source, of, revenue, if, he, uses, it, as, a, stock, reserved, for, immediate, consumption, he, acts, the, part, of, a, prodigal, and, dissipates, in, the, maintenance, of, the, idle, what, was, destined, for, the, support, of, the, industrious, he, can, in, this, case, neither, restore, the, capital, nor, pay, the, interest, without, either, alienating, or, encroaching, upon, some, other, source, of, revenue, such, as, the, property, or, the, rent, of, land, the, stock, which, is, lent, at, interest, is, no, doubt, occasionally, employed, in, both, these, ways, but, in, the, former, much, more, frequently, than, in, the, latter, of, the, different, employment, of, capital, a, capital, may, be, employed, in, four, different, ways, either, first, in, procuring, the, rude, produce, annually, required, for, the, use, and, consumption, of, the, society, or, secondly, in, manufacturing, and, preparing, that, rude, produce, for, immediate, use, and, consumption, or, thirdly, in, transporting, either, the, rude, or, manufactured, produce, from, the, places, where, they, abound, to, those, where, they, are, wanted, or, lastly, in, dividing, particular, portions, of, either, into, such, small, parcels, as, suit, the, occasional, demands, of, those, who, want, them, adam, smith, uses, this, example, to, address, long, term, economic, growth, smith, states, as, subsistence, is, in, the, nature, of, things, prior, to, conveniency, and, luxury, so, the, industry, which, procures, the, former, must, necessarily, be, prior, to, that, which, ministers, to, the, latter, in, order, for, industrial, success, subsistence, is, required, first, from, the, countryside, industry, and, trade, occur, in, cities, while, agriculture, occurs, in, the, countryside, agricultural, work, is, a, more, desirable, situation, than, industrial, work, because, the, owner, is, in, complete, control, smith, states, that, in, our, north, american, colonies, where, uncultivated, land, is, still, to, be, had, upon, easy, terms, no, manufactures, for, distant, sale, have, ever, yet, been, established, in, any, of, their, towns, when, an, artificer, has, acquired, a, little, more, stock, than, is, necessary, for, carrying, on, his, own, business, in, supplying, the, neighbouring, country, he, does, not, in, north, america, attempt, to, establish, with, it, a, manufacture, for, more, distant, sale, but, employs, it, in, the, purchase, and, improvement, of, uncultivated, land, from, artificer, he, becomes, planter, and, neither, the, large, wages, nor, the, easy, subsistence, which, that, country, affords, to, artificers, can, bribe, him, rather, to, work, for, other, people, than, for, himself, he, feels, that, an, artificer, is, the, servant, of, his, customers, from, whom, he, derives, his, subsistence, but, that, a, planter, who, cultivates, his, own, land, and, derives, his, necessary, subsistence, from, the, labour, of, his, own, family, is, really, a, master, and, independent, of, all, the, world, where, there, is, open, countryside, agriculture, is, much, preferable, to, industrial, occupations, and, ownership, adam, smith, goes, on, to, say, according, to, the, natural, course, of, things, therefore, the, greater, part, of, the, capital, of, every, growing, society, is, first, directed, to, agriculture, afterwards, to, manufactures, and, last, of, all, to, foreign, commerce, this, sequence, leads, to, growth, and, therefore, opulence, the, great, commerce, of, every, civilised, society, is, that, carried, on, between, the, inhabitants, of, the, town, and, those, of, the, country, it, consists, in, the, exchange, of, crude, for, manufactured, produce, either, immediately, or, by, the, intervention, of, money, or, of, some, sort, of, paper, which, represents, money, the, country, supplies, the, town, with, the, means, of, subsistence, and, the, materials, of, manufacture, the, town, repays, this, supply, by, sending, back, a, part, of, the, manufactured, produce, to, the, inhabitants, of, the, country, the, town, in, which, there, neither, is, nor, can, be, any, reproduction, of, substances, may, very, properly, be, said, to, gain, its, whole, wealth, and, subsistence, from, the, country, we, must, not, however, upon, this, account, imagine, that, the, gain, of, the, town, is, the, loss, of, the, country, the, gains, of, both, are, mutual, and, reciprocal, and, the, division, of, labour, is, in, this, as, in, all, other, cases, advantageous, to, all, the, different, persons, employed, in, the, various, occupations, into, which, it, is, subdivided, of, the, discouragement, of, agriculture, chapter, 2, s, long, title, is, of, the, discouragement, of, agriculture, in, the, ancient, state, of, europe, after, the, fall, of, the, roman, empire, when, the, german, and, scythian, nations, overran, the, western, provinces, of, the, roman, empire, the, confusions, which, followed, so, great, a, revolution, lasted, for, several, centuries, the, rapine, and, violence, which, the, barbarians, exercised, against, the, ancient, inhabitants, interrupted, the, commerce, between, the, towns, and, the, country, the, towns, were, deserted, and, the, country, was, left, uncultivated, and, the, western, provinces, of, europe, which, had, enjoyed, a, considerable, degree, of, opulence, under, the, roman, empire, sunk, into, the, lowest, state, of, poverty, and, barbarism, during, the, continuance, of, those, confusions, the, chiefs, and, principal, leaders, of, those, nations, acquired, or, usurped, to, themselves, the, greater, part, of, the, lands, of, those, countries, a, great, part, of, them, was, uncultivated, but, no, part, of, them, whether, cultivated, or, uncultivated, was, left, without, a, proprietor, all, of, them, were, engrossed, and, the, greater, part, by, a, few, great, proprietors, this, original, engrossing, of, uncultivated, lands, though, a, great, might, have, been, but, a, transitory, evil, they, might, soon, have, been, divided, again, and, broke, into, small, parcels, either, by, succession, or, by, alienation, the, law, of, primogeniture, hindered, them, from, being, divided, by, succession, the, introduction, of, entails, prevented, their, being, broke, into, small, parcels, by, alienation, of, the, rise, and, progress, of, cities, and, towns, after, the, fall, of, the, roman, empire, the, inhabitants, of, cities, and, towns, were, after, the, fall, of, the, roman, empire, not, more, favoured, than, those, of, the, country, they, consisted, indeed, of, a, very, different, order, of, people, from, the, first, inhabitants, of, the, ancient, republics, of, greece, and, italy, these, last, were, composed, chiefly, of, the, proprietors, of, lands, among, whom, the, public, territory, was, originally, divided, and, who, found, it, convenient, to, build, their, houses, in, the, neighbourhood, of, one, another, and, to, surround, them, with, a, wall, for, the, sake, of, common, defence, after, the, fall, of, the, roman, empire, on, the, contrary, the, proprietors, of, land, seem, generally, to, have, lived, in, fortified, castles, on, their, own, estates, and, in, the, midst, of, their, own, tenants, and, dependants, the, towns, were, chiefly, inhabited, by, tradesmen, and, mechanics, who, seem, in, those, days, to, have, been, of, servile, or, very, nearly, of, servile, condition, the, privileges, which, we, find, granted, by, ancient, charters, to, the, inhabitants, of, some, of, the, principal, towns, in, europe, sufficiently, show, what, they, were, before, those, grants, the, people, to, whom, it, is, granted, as, a, privilege, that, they, might, give, away, their, own, daughters, in, marriage, without, the, consent, of, their, lord, that, upon, their, death, their, own, children, and, not, their, lord, should, succeed, to, their, goods, and, that, they, might, dispose, of, their, own, effects, by, will, must, before, those, grants, have, been, either, altogether, or, very, nearly, in, the, same, state, of, villanage, with, the, occupiers, of, land, in, the, country, how, the, commerce, of, the, towns, contributed, to, the, improvement, of, the, country, smith, often, harshly, criticised, those, who, act, purely, out, of, self, interest, and, greed, and, warns, that, ll, for, ourselves, and, nothing, for, other, people, seems, in, every, age, of, the, world, to, have, been, the, vile, maxim, of, the, masters, of, mankind, smith, vigorously, attacked, the, antiquated, government, restrictions, he, thought, hindered, industrial, expansion, in, fact, he, attacked, most, forms, of, government, interference, in, the, economic, process, including, tariffs, arguing, that, this, creates, inefficiency, and, high, prices, in, the, long, run, it, is, believed, that, this, theory, influenced, government, legislation, in, later, years, especially, during, the, 19th, century, smith, advocated, a, government, that, was, active, in, sectors, other, than, the, economy, he, advocated, public, education, for, poor, adults, a, judiciary, and, a, standing, army, institutional, systems, not, directly, profitable, for, private, industries, of, the, principle, of, the, commercial, or, mercantile, system, the, book, has, sometimes, been, described, as, a, critique, of, mercantilism, and, a, synthesis, of, the, emerging, economic, thinking, of, smith, s, time, specifically, the, wealth, of, nations, attacks, inter, alia, two, major, tenets, of, mercantilism, of, restraints, upon, the, importation, chapter, 2, s, full, title, is, of, restraints, upon, the, importation, from, foreign, countries, of, such, goods, as, can, be, produced, at, home, the, invisible, hand, is, a, frequently, referenced, theme, from, the, book, although, it, is, specifically, mentioned, only, once, as, every, individual, therefore, endeavours, as, much, as, he, can, both, to, employ, his, capital, in, the, support, of, domestic, industry, and, so, to, direct, that, industry, that, its, produce, may, be, of, the, greatest, value, every, individual, necessarily, labours, to, render, the, annual, revenue, of, the, society, as, great, as, he, can, he, generally, indeed, neither, intends, to, promote, the, public, interest, nor, knows, how, much, he, is, promoting, it, by, preferring, the, support, of, domestic, to, that, of, foreign, industry, he, intends, only, his, own, security, and, by, directing, that, industry, in, such, a, manner, as, its, produce, may, be, of, the, greatest, value, he, intends, only, his, own, gain, and, he, is, in, this, as, in, many, other, cases, led, by, an, invisible, hand, to, promote, an, end, which, was, no, part, of, his, intention, nor, is, it, always, the, worse, for, the, society, that, it, was, no, part, of, it, by, pursuing, his, own, interest, he, frequently, promotes, that, of, the, society, more, effectually, than, when, he, really, intends, to, promote, it, book, 4, chapter, 2, the, metaphor, of, the, invisible, hand, has, been, widely, used, out, of, context, in, the, passage, above, smith, is, referring, to, the, support, of, domestic, industry, and, contrasting, that, support, with, the, importation, of, goods, neoclassical, economic, theory, has, expanded, the, metaphor, beyond, the, domestic, foreign, manufacture, argument, to, encompass, nearly, all, aspects, of, economics, of, the, extraordinary, restraints, chapter, 3, s, long, title, is, of, the, extraordinary, restraints, upon, the, importation, of, goods, of, almost, all, kinds, from, those, countries, with, which, the, balance, is, supposed, to, be, disadvantageous, of, drawbacks, merchants, and, manufacturers, are, not, contented, with, the, monopoly, of, the, home, market, but, desire, likewise, the, most, extensive, foreign, sale, for, their, goods, their, country, has, no, jurisdiction, in, foreign, nations, and, therefore, can, seldom, procure, them, any, monopoly, there, they, are, generally, obliged, therefore, to, content, themselves, with, petitioning, for, certain, encouragements, to, exportation, of, these, encouragements, what, are, called, drawbacks, seem, to, be, the, most, reasonable, to, allow, the, merchant, to, draw, back, upon, exportation, either, the, whole, or, a, part, of, whatever, excise, or, inland, duty, is, imposed, upon, domestic, industry, can, never, occasion, the, exportation, of, a, greater, quantity, of, goods, than, what, would, have, been, exported, had, no, duty, been, imposed, such, encouragements, do, not, tend, to, turn, towards, any, particular, employment, a, greater, share, of, the, capital, of, the, country, than, what, would, go, to, that, employment, of, its, own, accord, but, only, to, hinder, the, duty, from, driving, away, any, part, of, that, shares, to, other, employments, of, bounties, bounties, upon, exportation, are, in, great, britain, frequently, petitioned, for, and, sometimes, granted, to, the, produce, of, particular, branches, of, domestic, industry, by, means, of, them, our, merchants, and, manufacturers, it, is, pretended, will, be, enabled, to, sell, their, goods, as, cheap, or, cheaper, than, their, rivals, in, the, foreign, market, a, greater, quantity, it, is, said, will, thus, be, exported, and, the, balance, of, trade, consequently, turned, more, in, favour, of, our, own, country, we, cannot, give, our, workmen, a, monopoly, in, the, foreign, as, we, have, done, in, the, home, market, we, cannot, force, foreigners, to, buy, their, goods, as, we, have, done, our, own, countrymen, the, next, best, expedient, it, has, been, thought, therefore, is, to, pay, them, for, buying, it, is, in, this, manner, that, the, mercantile, system, proposes, to, enrich, the, whole, country, and, to, put, money, into, all, our, pockets, by, means, of, the, balance, of, trade, of, treaties, of, commerce, when, a, nation, binds, itself, by, treaty, either, to, permit, the, entry, of, certain, goods, from, one, foreign, country, which, it, prohibits, from, all, others, or, to, exempt, the, goods, of, one, country, from, duties, to, which, it, subjects, those, of, all, others, the, country, or, at, least, the, merchants, and, manufacturers, of, the, country, whose, commerce, is, so, favoured, must, necessarily, derive, great, advantage, from, the, treaty, those, merchants, and, manufacturers, enjoy, a, sort, of, monopoly, in, the, country, which, is, so, indulgent, to, them, that, country, becomes, a, market, both, more, extensive, and, more, advantageous, for, their, goods, more, extensive, because, the, goods, of, other, nations, being, either, excluded, or, subjected, to, heavier, duties, it, takes, off, a, greater, quantity, of, theirs, more, advantageous, because, the, merchants, of, the, favoured, country, enjoying, a, sort, of, monopoly, there, will, often, sell, their, goods, for, a, better, price, than, if, exposed, to, the, free, competition, of, all, other, nations, such, treaties, however, though, they, may, be, advantageous, to, the, merchants, and, manufacturers, of, the, favoured, are, necessarily, disadvantageous, to, those, of, the, favouring, country, a, monopoly, is, thus, granted, against, them, to, a, foreign, nation, and, they, must, frequently, buy, the, foreign, goods, they, have, occasion, for, dearer, than, if, the, free, competition, of, other, nations, was, admitted, of, colonies, of, the, motives, for, establishing, new, colonies, the, interest, which, occasioned, the, first, settlement, of, the, different, european, colonies, in, america, and, the, west, indies, was, not, altogether, so, plain, and, distinct, as, that, which, directed, the, establishment, of, those, of, ancient, greece, and, rome, all, the, different, states, of, ancient, greece, possessed, each, of, them, but, a, very, small, territory, and, when, the, people, in, any, one, of, them, multiplied, beyond, what, that, territory, could, easily, maintain, a, part, of, them, were, sent, in, quest, of, a, new, habitation, in, some, remote, and, distant, part, of, the, world, warlike, neighbours, surrounded, them, on, all, sides, rendering, it, difficult, for, any, of, them, to, enlarge, their, territory, at, home, the, colonies, of, the, dorians, resorted, chiefly, to, italy, and, sicily, which, in, the, times, preceding, the, foundation, of, rome, were, inhabited, by, barbarous, and, uncivilised, nations, those, of, the, ionians, and, eolians, the, two, other, great, tribes, of, the, greeks, to, asia, minor, and, the, islands, of, the, egean, sea, of, which, the, inhabitants, seem, at, that, time, to, have, been, pretty, much, in, the, same, state, as, those, of, sicily, and, italy, the, mother, city, though, she, considered, the, colony, as, a, child, at, all, times, entitled, to, great, favour, and, assistance, and, owing, in, return, much, gratitude, and, respect, yet, considered, it, as, an, emancipated, child, over, whom, she, pretended, to, claim, no, direct, authority, or, jurisdiction, the, colony, settled, its, own, form, of, government, enacted, its, own, laws, elected, its, own, magistrates, and, made, peace, or, war, with, its, neighbours, as, an, independent, state, which, had, no, occasion, to, wait, for, the, approbation, or, consent, of, the, mother, city, nothing, can, be, more, plain, and, distinct, than, the, interest, which, directed, every, such, establishment, causes, of, prosperity, of, new, colonies, the, colony, of, a, civilised, nation, which, takes, possession, either, of, a, waste, country, or, of, one, so, thinly, inhabited, that, the, natives, easily, give, place, to, the, new, settlers, advances, more, rapidly, to, wealth, and, greatness, than, any, other, human, society, the, colonists, carry, out, with, them, a, knowledge, of, agriculture, and, of, other, useful, arts, superior, to, what, can, grow, up, of, its, own, accord, in, the, course, of, many, centuries, among, savage, and, barbarous, nations, they, carry, out, with, them, too, the, habit, of, subordination, some, notion, of, the, regular, government, which, takes, place, in, their, own, country, of, the, system, of, laws, which, supports, it, and, of, a, regular, administration, of, justice, and, they, naturally, establish, something, of, the, same, kind, in, the, new, settlement, of, the, advantages, which, europe, has, derived, from, the, discovery, of, america, and, from, that, of, a, passage, to, the, east, indies, by, the, cape, of, good, hope, such, are, the, advantages, which, the, colonies, of, america, have, derived, from, the, policy, of, europe, what, are, those, which, europe, has, derived, from, the, discovery, and, colonisation, of, america, those, advantages, may, be, divided, first, into, the, general, advantages, which, europe, considered, as, one, great, country, has, derived, from, those, great, events, and, secondly, into, the, particular, advantages, which, each, colonising, country, has, derived, from, the, colonies, which, particularly, belong, to, it, in, consequence, of, the, authority, or, dominion, which, it, exercises, over, them, the, general, advantages, which, europe, considered, as, one, great, country, has, derived, from, the, discovery, and, colonisation, of, america, consist, first, in, the, increase, of, its, enjoyments, and, secondly, in, the, augmentation, of, its, industry, the, surplus, produce, of, america, imported, into, europe, furnishes, the, inhabitants, of, this, great, continent, with, a, variety, of, commodities, which, they, could, not, otherwise, have, possessed, some, for, conveniency, and, use, some, for, pleasure, and, some, for, ornament, and, thereby, contributes, to, increase, their, enjoyments, conclusion, of, the, mercantile, system, smith, s, argument, about, the, international, political, economy, opposed, the, idea, of, mercantilism, while, the, mercantile, system, encouraged, each, country, to, hoard, gold, while, trying, to, grasp, hegemony, smith, argued, that, free, trade, eventually, makes, all, actors, better, off, this, argument, is, the, modern, free, trade, argument, of, the, agricultural, systems, chapter, 9, s, long, title, is, of, the, agricultural, systems, or, of, those, systems, of, political, economy, which, represent, the, produce, of, land, as, either, the, sole, or, the, principal, source, of, the, revenue, and, wealth, of, every, country, that, system, which, represents, the, produce, of, land, as, the, sole, source, of, the, revenue, and, wealth, of, every, country, has, so, far, as, by, that, time, never, been, adopted, by, any, nation, and, it, at, present, exists, only, in, the, speculations, of, a, few, men, of, great, learning, and, ingenuity, in, france, it, would, not, surely, be, worthwhile, to, examine, at, great, length, the, errors, of, a, system, which, never, has, done, and, probably, never, will, do, any, harm, in, any, part, of, the, world, smith, postulated, four, maxims, of, taxation, proportionality, transparency, convenience, and, efficiency, some, economists, interpret, smith, s, opposition, to, taxes, on, transfers, of, money, such, as, the, stamp, act, as, opposition, to, capital, gains, taxes, which, did, not, exist, in, the, 18th, century, other, economists, credit, smith, as, one, of, the, first, to, advocate, a, progressive, tax, smith, wrote, the, necessaries, of, life, occasion, the, great, expense, of, the, poor, they, find, it, difficult, to, get, food, and, the, greater, part, of, their, little, revenue, is, spent, in, getting, it, the, luxuries, and, vanities, of, life, occasion, the, principal, expense, of, the, rich, and, a, magnificent, house, embellishes, and, sets, off, to, the, best, advantage, all, the, other, luxuries, and, vanities, which, they, possess, a, tax, upon, house, rents, therefore, would, in, general, fall, heaviest, upon, the, rich, and, in, this, sort, of, inequality, there, would, not, perhaps, be, anything, very, unreasonable, it, is, not, very, unreasonable, that, the, rich, should, contribute, to, the, public, expense, not, only, in, proportion, to, their, revenue, but, something, more, than, in, that, proportion, smith, believed, that, an, even, more, proper, source, of, progressive, taxation, than, property, taxes, was, ground, rent, smith, wrote, that, nothing, be, more, reasonable, than, a, land, value, tax, of, the, expenses, of, the, sovereign, or, commonwealth, smith, uses, this, chapter, to, comment, on, the, concept, of, taxation, and, expenditure, by, the, state, on, taxation, smith, wrote, the, subjects, of, every, state, ought, to, contribute, towards, the, support, of, the, government, as, nearly, as, possible, in, proportion, to, their, respective, abilities, that, is, in, proportion, to, the, revenue, which, they, respectively, enjoy, under, the, protection, of, the, state, the, expense, of, government, to, the, individuals, of, a, great, nation, is, like, the, expense, of, management, to, the, joint, tenants, of, a, great, estate, who, are, all, obliged, to, contribute, in, proportion, to, their, respective, interests, in, the, estate, in, the, observation, or, neglect, of, this, maxim, consists, what, is, called, the, equality, or, inequality, of, taxation, smith, advocates, a, tax, naturally, attached, to, the, abilities, and, habits, of, each, echelon, of, society, for, the, lower, echelon, smith, recognised, the, intellectually, erosive, effect, that, the, otherwise, beneficial, division, of, labour, can, have, on, workers, what, marx, though, he, mainly, opposes, smith, later, named, alienation, therefore, smith, warns, of, the, consequence, of, government, failing, to, fulfill, its, proper, role, which, is, to, preserve, against, the, innate, tendency, of, human, society, to, fall, apart, the, understandings, of, the, greater, part, of, men, are, necessarily, formed, by, their, ordinary, employments, the, man, whose, whole, life, is, spent, in, performing, a, few, simple, operations, of, which, the, effects, are, perhaps, always, the, same, or, very, nearly, the, same, has, no, occasion, to, exert, his, understanding, or, to, exercise, his, invention, in, finding, out, expedients, for, removing, difficulties, which, never, occur, he, naturally, loses, therefore, the, habit, of, such, exertion, and, generally, becomes, as, stupid, and, ignorant, as, it, is, possible, for, a, human, creature, to, become, the, torpor, of, his, mind, renders, him, not, only, incapable, of, relishing, or, bearing, a, part, in, any, rational, conversation, but, of, conceiving, any, generous, noble, or, tender, sentiment, and, consequently, of, forming, any, just, judgment, concerning, many, even, of, the, ordinary, duties, of, private, life, but, in, every, improved, and, civilized, society, this, is, the, state, into, which, the, labouring, poor, that, is, the, great, body, of, the, people, must, necessarily, fall, unless, government, takes, some, pains, to, prevent, it, under, smith, s, model, government, involvement, in, any, area, other, than, those, stated, above, negatively, impacts, economic, growth, this, is, because, economic, growth, is, determined, by, the, needs, of, a, free, market, and, the, entrepreneurial, nature, of, private, persons, a, shortage, of, a, product, makes, its, price, rise, and, so, stimulates, producers, to, produce, more, and, attracts, new, people, to, that, line, of, production, an, excess, supply, of, a, product, more, of, the, product, than, people, are, willing, to, buy, drives, prices, down, and, producers, refocus, energy, and, money, to, other, areas, where, there, is, a, need, of, the, sources, of, the, general, or, public, revenue, of, the, society, in, his, discussion, of, taxes, in, book, five, smith, wrote, the, necessaries, of, life, occasion, the, great, expense, of, the, poor, they, find, it, difficult, to, get, food, and, the, greater, part, of, their, little, revenue, is, spent, in, getting, it, the, luxuries, and, vanities, of, life, occasion, the, principal, expense, of, the, rich, and, a, magnificent, house, embellishes, and, sets, off, to, the, best, advantage, all, the, other, luxuries, and, vanities, which, they, possess, a, tax, upon, house, rents, therefore, would, in, general, fall, heaviest, upon, the, rich, and, in, this, sort, of, inequality, there, would, not, perhaps, be, anything, very, unreasonable, it, is, not, very, unreasonable, that, the, rich, should, contribute, to, the, public, expense, not, only, in, proportion, to, their, revenue, but, something, more, than, in, that, proportion, he, also, introduced, the, distinction, between, a, direct, tax, and, by, implication, an, indirect, tax, although, he, did, not, use, the, word, indirect, capitation, taxes, so, far, as, they, are, levied, upon, the, lower, ranks, of, people, are, direct, taxes, upon, the, wages, of, labour, and, are, attended, with, all, the, inconveniences, of, such, taxes, and, further, it, is, thus, that, a, tax, upon, the, necessaries, of, life, operates, exactly, in, the, same, manner, as, a, direct, tax, upon, the, wages, of, labour, this, term, was, later, used, in, united, states, article, i, section, 2, clause, 3, of, the, u, s, constitution, and, james, madison, who, wrote, much, of, the, constitution, is, known, to, have, read, smith, s, book, of, war, and, public, debts, when, war, comes, are, both, unwilling, and, unable, to, increase, their, revenue, in, proportion, to, the, increase, of, their, expense, they, are, unwilling, for, fear, of, offending, the, people, who, by, so, great, and, so, sudden, an, increase, of, taxes, would, soon, be, disgusted, with, the, war, the, facility, of, borrowing, delivers, them, from, the, embarrassment, by, means, of, borrowing, they, are, enabled, with, a, very, moderate, increase, of, taxes, to, raise, from, year, to, year, money, sufficient, for, carrying, on, the, war, and, by, the, practice, of, perpetually, funding, they, are, enabled, with, the, smallest, possible, increase, of, taxes, to, raise, annually, the, largest, possible, sum, of, money, the, return, of, peace, indeed, seldom, relieves, them, from, the, greater, part, of, the, taxes, imposed, during, the, war, these, are, mortgaged, for, the, interest, of, the, debt, contracted, in, order, to, carry, it, on, smith, then, goes, on, to, say, that, even, if, money, was, set, aside, from, future, revenues, to, pay, for, the, debts, of, war, it, seldom, actually, gets, used, to, pay, down, the, debt, politicians, are, inclined, to, spend, the, money, on, some, other, scheme, that, will, win, the, favour, of, their, constituents, hence, interest, payments, rise, and, war, debts, continue, to, grow, larger, well, beyond, the, end, of, the, war, summing, up, if, governments, can, borrow, without, check, then, they, are, more, likely, to, wage, war, without, check, and, the, costs, of, the, war, spending, will, burden, future, generations, since, war, debts, are, almost, never, repaid, by, the, generations, that, incurred, them, the, first, edition, of, the, book, sold, out, in, six, months, the, printer, william, strahan, wrote, on, 12, april, 1776, that, david, hume, said, the, wealth, of, nations, required, too, much, thought, to, be, as, popular, as, edward, gibbon, s, the, history, of, the, decline, and, fall, of, the, roman, empire, strahan, also, wrote, what, you, say, of, mr, gibbon, s, and, dr, smith, s, book, is, exactly, just, the, former, is, the, most, popular, work, but, the, sale, of, the, latter, though, not, near, so, rapid, has, been, more, than, i, could, have, expected, from, a, work, that, requires, much, thought, and, reflection, qualities, that, do, not, abound, among, modern, readers, to, peruse, to, any, purpose, gibbon, wrote, to, adam, ferguson, on, 1, april, what, an, excellent, work, is, that, with, which, our, common, friend, mr, adam, smith, has, enriched, the, public, an, extensive, science, in, a, single, book, and, the, most, profound, ideas, expressed, in, the, most, perspicuous, language, the, review, of, the, book, in, the, annual, register, was, probably, written, by, whig, mp, edmund, burke, in, 1791, the, english, born, radical, thomas, paine, wrote, in, his, rights, of, man, that, had, mr, burke, possessed, talents, similar, to, the, author, on, the, wealth, of, nations, he, would, have, comprehended, all, the, parts, which, enter, into, and, by, assemblage, form, a, constitution, in, 1800, the, anti, jacobin, review, criticized, the, wealth, of, nations, in, 1803, the, times, argued, against, war, with, spain, she, is, our, best, customer, and, by, the, gentle, and, peaceable, stream, of, commerce, the, treasures, of, the, new, world, flow, with, greater, certainty, into, english, reservoirs, than, it, could, do, by, the, most, successful, warfare, they, come, in, this, way, to, support, our, manufactures, to, encourage, industry, to, feed, our, poor, to, pay, taxes, to, reward, ingenuity, to, diffuse, riches, among, all, classes, of, people, but, for, the, full, understanding, of, this, beneficial, circulation, of, wealth, we, must, refer, to, dr, adam, smith, s, incomparable, treatise, on, the, wealth, of, nations, in, 1810, a, correspondent, writing, under, the, pseudonym, of, publicola, included, at, the, head, of, his, letter, smith, s, line, that, exclusive, companies, are, nuisances, in, every, respect, and, called, him, that, learned, writer, in, 1812, robert, southey, of, the, quarterly, review, condemned, the, wealth, of, nations, as, a, tedious, and, hard, hearted, book, in, 1821, the, times, quoted, smith, s, opinion, that, the, interests, of, corn, dealers, and, the, people, were, the, same, in, 1826, the, english, radical, william, cobbett, criticised, in, his, rural, rides, the, political, economists, hostility, to, the, poor, law, well, amidst, all, this, suffering, there, is, one, good, thing, the, scotch, political, economy, is, blown, to, the, devil, and, the, edinburgh, review, and, adam, smith, along, with, it, in, 1829, thomas, carlyle, named, smith, as, one, of, the, philosophers, of, the, age, who, taught, that, our, happiness, depends, entirely, on, external, circumstances, and, to, whose, eye, all, is, well, that, works, quietly, the, liberal, statesman, william, ewart, gladstone, chaired, the, meeting, of, the, political, economy, club, to, celebrate, the, centenary, of, the, publication, of, the, wealth, of, nations, the, liberal, historian, lord, acton, believed, that, the, wealth, of, nations, gave, a, scientific, backbone, to, liberal, sentiment, and, that, it, was, the, classic, english, philosophy, of, history, smith, s, biographer, john, rae, contended, that, the, wealth, of, nations, shaped, government, policy, soon, after, it, was, published, in, 1777, in, the, first, budget, after, the, book, was, published, prime, minister, lord, north, got, the, idea, for, two, new, taxes, from, the, book, one, on, man, servants, and, the, other, on, property, sold, at, auction, the, budget, of, 1778, introduced, the, inhabited, house, duty, and, the, malt, tax, both, recommended, by, smith, in, 1779, smith, was, consulted, by, politicians, henry, dundas, and, lord, carlisle, on, the, subject, of, giving, ireland, free, trade, the, wealth, of, nations, was, first, mentioned, in, parliament, by, the, whig, leader, charles, james, fox, on, 11, november, 1783, there, was, a, maxim, laid, down, in, an, excellent, book, upon, the, wealth, of, nations, which, had, been, ridiculed, for, its, simplicity, but, which, was, indisputable, as, to, its, truth, in, that, book, it, was, stated, that, the, only, way, to, become, rich, was, to, manage, matters, so, as, to, make, one, s, income, exceed, one, s, expenses, this, maxim, applied, equally, to, an, individual, and, to, a, nation, the, proper, line, of, conduct, therefore, was, by, a, well, directed, economy, to, retrench, every, current, expense, and, to, make, as, large, a, saving, during, the, peace, as, possible, however, fox, once, told, charles, butler, sometime, after, 1785, that, he, had, never, read, the, book, and, that, there, is, something, in, all, these, subjects, which, passes, my, comprehension, something, so, wide, that, i, could, never, embrace, them, myself, nor, find, any, one, who, did, when, fox, was, dining, with, lord, lauderdale, in, 1796, lauderdale, remarked, that, they, knew, nothing, of, political, economy, before, adam, smith, wrote, pooh, replied, fox, your, adam, smiths, are, nothing, but, he, added, turning, to, the, company, that, is, his, love, we, must, spare, him, there, lauderdale, replied, i, think, he, is, everything, to, which, fox, rejoined, that, is, a, great, proof, of, your, affection, fox, also, found, adam, smith, tedious, and, believed, that, one, half, of, the, wealth, of, nations, could, be, omitted, with, much, benefit, to, the, subject, the, wealth, of, nations, was, next, mentioned, in, parliament, by, robert, thornton, mp, in, 1787, to, support, the, commercial, treaty, with, france, in, the, same, year, george, dempster, mp, referenced, it, in, the, debate, on, the, proposal, to, farm, the, post, horse, duties, and, in, 1788, by, a, mr, hussy, on, the, wool, exportation, bill, the, prime, minister, william, pitt, praised, smith, in, the, house, of, commons, on, 17, february, 1792, an, author, of, our, own, times, now, unfortunately, no, more, i, mean, the, author, of, a, celebrated, treatise, on, the, wealth, of, nations, whose, extensive, knowledge, of, detail, and, depth, of, philosophical, research, will, i, believe, furnish, the, best, solution, to, every, question, connected, with, the, history, of, commerce, or, with, the, systems, of, political, economy, in, the, same, year, it, was, quoted, by, samuel, whitbread, mp, and, fox, on, the, division, of, labour, in, the, debate, on, the, armament, against, russia, and, also, by, william, wilberforce, in, introducing, his, bill, against, the, slave, trade, the, book, was, not, mentioned, in, the, house, of, lords, until, a, debate, in, 1793, between, lord, lansdowne, and, lord, loughborough, about, revolutionary, principles, in, france, on, 16, may, 1797, pitt, said, in, the, debate, on, the, suspension, of, cash, payments, by, the, bank, of, england, that, smith, was, that, great, author, but, his, arguments, though, always, ingenious, were, sometimes, injudicious, in, 1798, sir, john, mitford, the, solicitor, general, cited, the, book, in, his, criticism, of, bills, of, exchange, given, in, consideration, of, other, bills, during, a, debate, on, the, price, of, corn, in, 1800, lord, warwick, said, there, was, hardly, any, kind, of, property, on, which, the, law, did, not, impose, some, restraints, and, regulations, with, regard, to, the, sale, of, them, except, that, of, provisions, this, was, probably, done, on, the, principles, laid, down, by, a, celebrated, and, able, writer, doctor, adam, smith, who, had, maintained, that, every, thing, ought, to, be, left, to, its, own, level, he, knew, something, of, that, gentleman, whose, heart, he, knew, was, as, sound, as, his, head, and, he, was, sure, that, had, he, lived, to, this, day, and, beheld, the, novel, state, of, wretchedness, to, which, the, country, was, now, reduced, that, great, man, would, have, reason, to, blush, for, some, of, the, doctrines, he, had, laid, down, he, would, now, have, abundant, opportunities, of, observing, that, all, those, artificial, means, of, enhancing, the, price, of, provisions, which, he, had, considered, as, no, way, mischievous, were, practised, at, this, time, to, a, most, alarming, extent, he, would, see, the, farmer, keeping, up, his, produce, while, the, poor, were, labouring, under, all, the, miseries, of, want, and, he, would, see, forestallers, regraters, and, all, kinds, of, middle, men, making, large, profits, upon, it, lord, grenville, replied, hen, that, great, man, lived, his, book, was, first, published, at, a, period, previous, to, which, there, had, been, two, or, three, seasons, of, great, dearth, and, distress, and, during, those, seasons, there, were, speculators, without, number, who, proposed, that, a, certain, price, should, be, fixed, on, every, article, but, all, their, plans, were, wisely, rejected, and, the, treatise, on, the, wealth, of, nations, which, came, forward, soon, after, pointed, out, in, the, clearest, light, how, absurd, and, futile, they, must, have, been, the, radical, mp, richard, cobden, studied, the, wealth, of, nations, as, a, young, man, his, copy, is, still, in, the, library, of, his, home, at, dunford, house, and, there, are, marginal, notes, on, the, places, where, smith, criticizes, british, colonial, policies, there, are, none, on, the, passage, about, the, invisible, hand, cobden, campaigned, for, free, trade, in, his, agitation, against, the, corn, laws, in, 1843, cobden, quoted, smith, s, protest, against, the, plain, violation, of, the, most, sacred, property, of, every, man, derived, from, his, labour, in, 1844, he, cited, smith, s, opposition, to, slave, labour, and, claimed, that, smith, had, been, misrepresented, by, protectionists, as, a, monopolist, in, 1849, cobden, claimed, that, he, had, gone, through, the, length, and, breadth, of, this, country, with, adam, smith, in, my, hand, to, advocate, the, principles, of, free, trade, he, also, said, he, had, tried, to, popularise, to, the, people, of, this, country, and, of, the, continent, those, arguments, with, which, adam, smith, and, every, man, who, has, written, on, this, subject, have, demonstrated, the, funding, system, to, be, injurious, to, mankind, cobden, believed, it, to, be, morally, wrong, to, lend, money, to, be, spent, on, war, in, 1849, when, the, times, claimed, political, economists, were, against, cobden, on, this, cobden, wrote, i, can, quote, adam, smith, whose, authority, is, without, appeal, now, in, intellectual, circles, it, gives, one, the, basis, of, science, upon, which, to, raise, appeals, to, the, moral, feelings, in, 1850, when, the, russian, government, attempted, to, raise, a, loan, to, cover, the, deficit, brought, about, by, its, war, against, hungary, cobden, said, i, take, my, stand, on, one, of, the, strongest, grounds, in, stating, that, adam, smith, and, other, great, authorities, on, political, economy, are, opposed, to, the, very, principle, of, such, loans, in, 1863, during, cobden, s, dispute, with, the, times, over, its, claims, that, his, fellow, radical, john, bright, wanted, to, divide, the, land, of, the, rich, amongst, the, poor, cobden, read, to, a, friend, the, passage, in, the, wealth, of, nations, which, criticized, primogeniture, and, entail, cobden, said, that, if, bright, had, been, as, plain, speaking, as, smith, how, he, would, have, been, branded, as, an, incendiary, and, socialist, in, 1864, cobden, proclaimed, if, i, were, five, and, twenty, or, thirty, i, would, take, adam, smith, in, hand, and, i, would, have, a, league, for, free, trade, in, land, just, as, we, had, a, league, for, free, trade, in, corn, you, will, find, just, the, same, authority, in, adam, smith, for, the, one, as, for, the, other, after, the, conquest, of, new, france, in, 1760, during, the, french, and, indian, war, charles, townshend, suggested, that, the, american, colonists, provide, help, to, pay, for, the, war, debt, by, paying, an, additional, tax, on, tea, during, this, time, adam, smith, was, working, for, townshend, and, developed, a, relationship, with, benjamin, franklin, who, played, a, vital, role, in, the, american, revolution, three, months, after, smith, s, the, wealth, of, nations, book, was, released, james, madison, in, a, speech, given, in, congress, on, 2, february, 1791, cited, the, wealth, of, nations, in, opposing, a, national, bank, the, principal, disadvantages, consisted, in, 1st, banishing, the, precious, metals, by, substituting, another, medium, to, perform, their, office, this, effect, was, inevitable, it, was, admitted, by, the, most, enlightened, patrons, of, banks, particularly, by, smith, on, the, wealth, of, nations, thomas, jefferson, writing, to, john, norvell, on, 14, june, 1807, claimed, that, on, the, subjects, of, money, commerce, smith, s, wealth, of, nations, is, the, best, book, to, be, read, unless, say, s, political, economy, can, be, had, which, treats, the, same, subject, on, the, same, principles, but, in, a, shorter, compass, more, lucid, manner, with, 36, 331, citations, it, is, the, second, most, cited, book, in, economics, published, before, 1950, behind, karl, marx, s, das, kapital, george, stigler, attributes, to, smith, the, most, important, substantive, proposition, in, all, of, economics, and, foundation, of, resource, allocation, theory, it, is, that, under, competition, owners, of, resources, labour, land, and, capital, will, use, them, most, profitably, resulting, in, an, equal, rate, of, return, in, equilibrium, for, all, uses, adjusted, for, apparent, differences, arising, from, such, factors, as, training, trust, hardship, and, unemployment, he, also, describes, smith, s, theorem, that, the, division, of, labour, is, limited, by, the, extent, of, the, market, as, the, core, of, a, theory, of, the, functions, of, firm, and, industry, and, a, fundamental, principle, of, economic, organisation, paul, samuelson, finds, in, smith, s, pluralist, use, of, supply, and, demand, as, applied, to, wages, rents, and, profit, a, valid, and, valuable, anticipation, of, the, general, equilibrium, modelling, of, walras, a, century, later, moreover, smith, s, allowance, for, wage, increases, in, the, short, and, intermediate, term, from, capital, accumulation, and, invention, added, a, realism, missed, later, by, malthus, and, ricardo, in, their, propounding, a, rigid, subsistence, wage, theory, of, labour, supply, in, noting, the, last, words, of, the, wealth, of, nations, if, any, of, the, provinces, of, the, british, empire, cannot, be, made, to, contribute, towards, the, support, of, the, whole, empire, it, is, surely, time, that, great, britain, should, free, herself, from, the, expence, of, defending, those, provinces, in, time, of, war, and, of, supporting, any, part, of, their, civil, or, military, establishments, in, time, of, peace, and, endeavour, to, accommodate, her, future, views, and, designs, to, the, real, mediocrity, of, her, circumstances, ronald, coase, suggests, that, if, smith, s, earlier, proposal, of, granting, colonies, representation, in, the, british, parliament, proportional, to, their, contributions, to, public, revenues, had, been, followed, there, would, have, been, no, 1776, america, would, now, be, ruling, england, and, we, would, be, today, celebrating, adam, smith, not, simply, as, the, author, of, the, wealth, of, nations, but, hailing, him, as, a, founding, father, mark, blaug, argues, that, it, was, smith, s, achievement, to, shift, the, burden, of, proof, against, those, maintaining, that, the, pursuit, of, self, interest, does, not, achieve, social, good, but, he, notes, smith, s, relevant, attention, to, definite, institutional, arrangements, and, process, as, disciplining, self, interest, to, widen, the, scope, of, the, market, accumulate, capital, and, grow, income, economic, anthropologist, david, graeber, argues, that, throughout, antiquity, one, can, identify, many, different, systems, of, credit, and, later, monetary, exchange, drawing, evidence, for, his, argument, from, historical, and, also, ethnographical, records, that, the, traditional, explanation, for, the, origins, of, monetary, economies, from, primitive, bartering, systems, as, laid, out, by, adam, smith, does, not, find, empirical, support, the, author, argues, that, credit, systems, developed, as, means, of, account, long, before, the, advent, of, coinage, around, 600, bce, and, can, still, be, seen, operating, in, non, monetary, economies, the, idea, of, barter, on, the, other, hand, seems, only, to, apply, to, limited, exchanges, between, societies, that, had, infrequent, contact, and, often, in, a, context, of, ritualised, warfare, rendering, its, conceptualisation, among, economists, as, a, myth, as, an, alternative, explanation, for, the, creation, of, economic, life, the, author, suggests, that, it, originally, related, to, social, currencies, closely, related, to, non, market, quotidian, interactions, among, a, community, and, based, on, the, everyday, communism, that, is, based, on, mutual, expectations, and, responsibilities, among, individuals, this, type, of, economy, is, then, contrasted, with, the, moral, foundations, of, exchange, based, on, formal, equality, and, reciprocity, but, not, necessarily, leading, to, market, relations, and, hierarchy, based, on, clear, inequalities, that, tend, to, crystallise, in, customs, and, castes
