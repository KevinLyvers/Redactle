often, murder, the, detective, genre, began, around, the, same, time, as, speculative, fiction, and, other, genre, fiction, in, the, mid, nineteenth, century, and, has, remained, extremely, popular, particularly, in, novels, some, of, the, most, famous, heroes, of, detective, fiction, include, c, auguste, dupin, sherlock, holmes, kogoro, akechi, and, hercule, poirot, juvenile, stories, featuring, the, hardy, boys, nancy, drew, and, the, boxcar, children, have, also, remained, in, print, for, several, decades, some, scholars, such, as, r, h, pfeiffer, have, suggested, that, certain, ancient, and, religious, texts, bear, similarities, to, what, would, later, be, called, detective, fiction, in, the, old, testament, story, of, susanna, and, the, elders, the, protestant, bible, locates, this, story, within, the, apocrypha, the, account, told, by, two, witnesses, broke, down, when, daniel, cross, examines, them, in, response, author, julian, symons, has, argued, that, those, who, search, for, fragments, of, detection, in, the, bible, and, herodotus, are, looking, only, for, puzzles, and, that, these, puzzles, are, not, detective, stories, in, the, play, oedipus, rex, by, ancient, greek, playwright, sophocles, oedipus, investigates, the, unsolved, murder, of, king, laius, and, discovers, the, truth, after, questioning, various, witnesses, that, he, himself, is, the, culprit, although, oedipus, s, enquiry, is, based, on, supernatural, pre, rational, methods, that, are, evident, in, most, narratives, of, crime, until, the, development, of, enlightenment, thought, in, the, seventeenth, and, eighteenth, centuries, this, narrative, has, all, of, the, central, characteristics, and, formal, elements, of, the, detective, story, including, a, mystery, surrounding, a, murder, a, closed, circle, of, suspects, and, the, gradual, uncovering, of, a, hidden, past, one, thousand, and, one, nights, contains, several, of, the, earliest, detective, stories, anticipating, modern, detective, fiction, the, oldest, known, example, of, a, detective, story, was, the, three, apples, one, of, the, tales, narrated, by, scheherazade, in, the, one, thousand, and, one, nights, arabian, nights, in, this, story, a, fisherman, discovers, a, heavy, locked, chest, along, the, tigris, river, which, he, then, sells, to, the, abbasid, caliph, harun, al, rashid, when, harun, breaks, open, the, chest, he, discovers, the, body, of, a, young, woman, who, has, been, cut, into, pieces, harun, then, orders, his, vizier, ja, far, ibn, yahya, to, solve, the, crime, and, to, find, the, murderer, within, three, days, or, be, executed, if, he, fails, in, his, assignment, suspense, is, generated, through, multiple, plot, twists, that, occur, as, the, story, progressed, with, these, characteristics, this, may, be, considered, an, archetype, for, detective, fiction, it, anticipates, the, use, of, reverse, chronology, in, modern, detective, fiction, where, the, story, begins, with, a, crime, before, presenting, a, gradual, reconstruction, of, the, past, the, main, difference, between, ja, far, the, three, apples, and, later, fictional, detectives, such, as, sherlock, holmes, and, hercule, poirot, is, that, ja, far, has, no, desire, to, solve, the, case, the, whodunit, mystery, is, solved, when, the, murderer, himself, confessed, his, crime, this, in, turn, leads, to, another, assignment, in, which, ja, far, has, to, find, the, culprit, who, instigated, the, murder, within, three, days, or, else, be, executed, ja, far, again, fails, to, find, the, culprit, before, the, deadline, but, owing, to, chance, he, discovers, a, key, item, in, the, end, he, manages, to, solve, the, case, through, reasoning, in, order, to, prevent, his, own, execution, on, the, other, hand, two, other, arabian, nights, stories, the, merchant, and, the, thief, and, ali, khwaja, contain, two, of, the, earliest, fictional, detectives, who, uncover, clues, and, present, evidence, to, catch, or, convict, a, criminal, known, to, the, audience, with, the, story, unfolding, in, normal, chronology, and, the, criminal, already, known, to, the, audience, the, latter, involves, a, climax, where, the, titular, detective, protagonist, ali, khwaja, presents, evidence, from, expert, witnesses, in, a, court, gong, an, fiction, literally, case, records, of, a, public, law, court, is, an, early, genre, of, chinese, detective, fiction, some, well, known, stories, include, the, yuan, dynasty, story, circle, of, chalk, chinese, the, ming, dynasty, story, collection, bao, gong, an, chinese, and, the, 18th, century, di, gong, an, chinese, story, collection, the, latter, was, translated, into, english, as, celebrated, cases, of, judge, dee, by, dutch, sinologist, robert, van, gulik, who, then, used, the, style, and, characters, to, write, the, original, judge, dee, series, the, hero, detective, of, these, novels, was, typically, a, traditional, judge, or, similar, official, based, on, historical, personages, such, as, judge, bao, bao, qingtian, or, judge, dee, di, renjie, although, the, historical, characters, may, have, lived, in, an, earlier, period, such, as, the, song, or, tang, dynasty, most, stories, are, written, in, the, later, ming, or, qing, dynasty, period, these, novels, differ, from, the, western, tradition, in, several, points, as, described, by, van, gulik, van, gulik, chose, di, gong, an, to, translate, because, in, his, view, it, was, closer, to, the, western, literary, style, and, more, likely, to, appeal, to, non, chinese, readers, a, number, of, gong, an, works, may, have, been, lost, or, destroyed, during, the, literary, inquisitions, and, the, wars, in, ancient, china, in, traditional, chinese, culture, this, genre, was, not, prestigious, and, was, therefore, considered, less, worthy, of, preservation, than, works, of, philosophy, or, poetry, one, of, the, earliest, examples, of, detective, fiction, in, western, literature, is, voltaire, s, zadig, 1748, which, features, a, main, character, who, performs, feats, of, analysis, things, as, they, are, or, the, adventures, of, caleb, williams, 1794, by, william,

hoffmann, in, which, mlle, de, scudery, establishes, the, innocence, of, the, police, s, favorite, suspect, in, the, murder, of, a, jeweller, this, story, is, sometimes, cited, as, the, first, detective, story, and, as, a, direct, influence, on, edgar, allan, poe, s, the, murders, in, the, rue, morgue, 1841, also, suggested, as, a, possible, influence, on, poe, is, the, secret, cell, a, short, story, published, in, september, 1837, by, william, evans, burton, it, has, been, suggested, that, this, story, may, have, been, known, to, poe, who, worked, for, burton, in, 1839, the, story, was, about, a, london, policeman, who, solves, the, mystery, of, a, kidnapped, girl, burton, s, fictional, detective, relied, on, practical, methods, such, as, dogged, legwork, knowledge, of, the, underworld, and, undercover, surveillance, rather, than, brilliance, of, imagination, or, intellect, detective, fiction, in, the, english, language, literature, is, considered, to, have, begun, in, 1841, with, the, publication, of, poe, s, the, murders, in, the, rue, morgue, featuring, the, first, fictional, detective, the, eccentric, and, brilliant, c, auguste, dupin, when, the, character, first, appeared, the, word, detective, had, not, yet, been, used, in, english, however, the, character, s, name, dupin, originated, from, the, english, word, dupe, or, deception, poe, devised, a, plot, formula, that, s, been, successful, ever, since, give, or, take, a, few, shifting, variables, poe, followed, with, further, auguste, dupin, tales, the, mystery, of, marie, rog, t, in, 1842, and, the, purloined, letter, in, 1844, poe, referred, to, his, stories, as, tales, of, ratiocination, in, stories, such, as, these, the, primary, concern, of, the, plot, is, ascertaining, truth, and, the, usual, means, of, obtaining, the, truth, is, a, complex, and, mysterious, process, combining, intuitive, logic, astute, observation, and, perspicacious, inference, early, detective, stories, tended, to, follow, an, investigating, protagonist, from, the, first, scene, to, the, last, making, the, unravelling, a, practical, rather, than, emotional, matter, the, mystery, of, marie, rog, t, is, particularly, interesting, because, it, is, a, barely, fictionalized, account, based, on, poe, s, theory, of, what, happened, to, the, real, life, mary, cecilia, rogers, william, russell, 1806, 1876, was, among, the, first, english, authors, to, write, fictitious, police, memoirs, contributing, an, irregular, series, of, stories, under, the, pseudonym, waters, to, chambers, s, edinburgh, journal,

case, antoine, dupres, is, a, parody, of, auguste, dupin, who, is, less, concerned, with, solving, the, crime, than, he, is, in, setting, up, a, way, to, reveal, the, solution, with, a, dramatic, flourish, ross, nickerson, notes, that, many, of, the, american, writers, who, experimented, with, poe, s, established, rules, of, the, genre, were, women, inventing, a, subgenre, of, domestic, detective, fiction, that, flourished, for, several, generations, these, included, metta, fuller, victor, s, two, detective, novels, the, dead, letter, 1867, and, the, figure, eight, 1869, the, dead,

of, ideas, that, have, established, in, the, genre, several, classic, features, of, the, 20th, century, detective, story, although, the, moonstone, is, usually, seen, as, the, first, detective, novel, there, are, other, contenders, for, the, honor, a, number, of, critics, suggest, that, the, lesser, known, notting, hill, mystery, 1862, 63, written, by, the, pseudonymous, charles, felix, later,

stories, ronald, knox, in, his, decalogue, of, rules, for, detective, fiction, one, of, his, rules, was, to, avoid, supernatural, elements, so, that, the, focus, remained, on, the, mystery, itself,

may, be, exercised, in, narrating, the, crime, usually, a, homicide, and, the, subsequent, investigation, this, objective, was, to, conceal, the, identity, of, the, criminal, from, the, reader, until,
