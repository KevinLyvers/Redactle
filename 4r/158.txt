seize, his, throne, and, marry, hamlet, s, mother, hamlet, is, considered, among, the, most, powerful, and, influential, tragedies, in, the, english, language, with, a, story, capable, of, seemingly, endless, retelling, and, adaptation, by, others, it, is, widely, considered, one, of, the, greatest, plays, of, all, time, three, different, early, versions, of, the, play, are, extant, the, first, quarto, q1, 1603, the, second, quarto, q2, 1604, and, the, first, folio, f1, 1623, each, version, includes, lines, and, passages, missing, from, the, others, many, works, have, been, pointed, to, as, possible, sources, for, shakespeare, s, play, from, ancient, greek, tragedies, to, elizabethan, dramas, the, editors, of, the, arden, shakespeare, question, the, idea, of, source, hunting, pointing, out, that, it, presupposes, that, authors, always, require, ideas, from, other, works, for, their, own, and, suggests, that, no, author, can, have, an, original, idea, or, be, an, originator, when, shakespeare, wrote, there, were, many, stories, about, sons, avenging, the, murder, of, their, fathers, and, many, about, clever, avenging, sons, pretending, to, be, foolish, in, order, to, outsmart, their, foes, this, would, include, the, story, of, the, ancient, roman, lucius, junius, brutus, which, shakespeare, apparently, knew, as, well, as, the, story, of, amleth, which, was, preserved, in, latin, by, 13th, century, chronicler, saxo, grammaticus, in, his, gesta, danorum, and, printed, in, paris, in, 1514, the, amleth, story, was, subsequently, adapted, and, then, published, in, french, in, 1570, by, the, 16th, century, scholar, fran, ois, de, belleforest, it, has, a, number, of, plot, elements, and, major, characters, in, common, with, shakespeare, s, hamlet, and, lacks, others, that, are, found, in, shakespeare, belleforest, s, story, was, first, published, in, english, in, 1608, after, hamlet, had, been, written, though, it, s, possible, that, shakespeare, had, encountered, it, in, the, french, language, version, prince, hamlet, of, denmark, is, the, son, of, the, recently, deceased, king, hamlet, and, nephew, of, king, claudius, his, father, s, brother, and, successor, claudius, hastily, married, king, hamlet, s, widow, gertrude, hamlet, s, mother, and, took, the, throne, for, himself, denmark, has, a, long, standing, feud, with, neighbouring, norway, in, which,

sentries, bernardo, and, marcellus, discuss, a, ghost, resembling, the, late, king, hamlet, which, they, have, recently, seen, and, bring, prince, hamlet, s, friend, horatio, as, a, witness, after, the, ghost, appears, again, the, three, vow, to, tell, prince, hamlet, what, they, have, witnessed, the, court, gathers, the, next, day, and, king, claudius, and, queen, gertrude, discuss, affairs, of, state, with, their, elderly, adviser, polonius, claudius, grants, permission, for, polonius, s, son, laertes, to, return, to, school, in, france, and, he, sends, envoys, to, inform, the, king, of, norway, about, fortinbras, claudius, also, questions, hamlet, regarding, his, continuing, to, grieve, for, his, father, and, forbids, him, to, return, to, his, university, in, wittenberg, after, the, court, exits, hamlet, despairs, of, his, father, s, death, and, his, mother, s, hasty, remarriage, learning, of, the, ghost, from, horatio, hamlet, resolves, to, see, it, himself, as, polonius, s, son, laertes, prepares, to, depart, for, france, polonius, offers, him, advice, that, culminates, in, the, maxim, to, thine, own, self, be, true, polonius, s, daughter, ophelia, admits, her, interest, in, hamlet, but, laertes, warns, her, against, seeking, the, prince, s, attention, and, polonius, orders, her, to, reject, his, advances, that, night, on, the, rampart, the, ghost, appears, to, hamlet, tells, the, prince, that, he, was, murdered, by, claudius, by, pouring, poison, into, his, ear, as, he, slept, and, demands, that, hamlet, avenge, the, murder, hamlet, agrees, and, the, ghost, vanishes, the, prince, confides, to, horatio, and, the, sentries, that, from, now, on, he, plans, to, put, an, antic, disposition, on, or, act, as, though, he, has, gone, mad, hamlet, forces, them, to, swear, to, keep, his, plans, for, revenge, secret, however, he, remains, uncertain, of, the, ghost, s, reliability, ophelia, rushes, to, her, father, telling, him, that, hamlet, arrived, at, her, door, the, prior, night, half, undressed, and, behaving, erratically, polonius, blames, love, for, hamlet, s, madness, and, resolves, to, inform, claudius, and, gertrude, as, he, enters, to, do, so, the, king, and, queen, are, welcoming, rosencrantz, and, guildenstern, two, student, acquaintances, of, hamlet, to, elsinore, the, royal, couple, has, requested, that, the, two, students, investigate, the, cause, of, hamlet, s, mood, and, behaviour, additional, news, requires, that, polonius, wait, to, be, heard, messengers, from, norway, inform, claudius, that, the, king, of, norway, has, rebuked, prince, fortinbras, for, attempting, to, re, fight, his, father, s, battles, the, forces, that, fortinbras, had, conscripted, to, march, against, denmark, will, instead, be, sent, against, poland, though, they, will, pass, through, danish, territory, to, get, there, polonius, tells, claudius, and, gertrude, his, theory, regarding, hamlet, s, behaviour, and, then, speaks, to, hamlet, in, a, hall, of, the, castle, to, try, to, learn, more, hamlet, feigns, madness, and, subtly, insults, polonius, all, the, while, when, rosencrantz, and, guildenstern, arrive, hamlet, greets, his, friends, warmly, but, quickly, discerns, that, they, are, there, to, spy, on, him, for, claudius, hamlet, admits, that, he, is, upset, at, his, situation, but, refuses, to, give, the, true, reason, instead, remarking, what, a, piece, of, work, is, a, man, rosencrantz, and, guildenstern, tell, hamlet, that, they, have, brought, along, a, troupe, of, actors, that, they, met, while, travelling, to, elsinore, hamlet, after, welcoming, the, actors, and, dismissing, his, friends, turned, spies, asks, them, to, deliver, a, soliloquy, about, the, death, of, king, priam, and, queen, hecuba, at, the, climax, of, the, trojan, war, hamlet, then, asks, the, actors, to, stage, the, murder, of, gonzago, a, play, featuring, a, death, in, the, style, of, his, father, s, murder, hamlet, intends, to, study, claudius, s, reaction, to, the, play, and, thereby, determine, the, truth, of, the, ghost, s, story, of, claudius, s, guilt, polonius, forces, ophelia, to, return, hamlet, s, love, letters, to, the, prince, while, he, and, claudius, secretly, watch, in, order, to, evaluate, hamlet, s, reaction, hamlet, is, walking, alone, in, the, hall, as, the, king, and, polonius, await, ophelia, s, entrance, hamlet, muses, on, thoughts, of, life, versus, death, when, ophelia, enters, and, tries, to, return, hamlet, s, things, hamlet, accuses, her, of, immodesty, and, cries, get, thee, to, a, nunnery, though, it, is, unclear, whether, this, too, is, a, show, of, madness, or, genuine, distress, his, reaction, convinces, claudius, that, hamlet, is, not, mad, for, love, shortly, thereafter, the, court, assembles, to, watch, the, play, hamlet, has, commissioned, after, seeing, the, player, king, murdered, by, his, rival, pouring, poison, in, his, ear, claudius, abruptly, rises, and, runs, from, the, room, for, hamlet, this, is, proof, of, his, uncle, s, guilt, gertrude, summons, hamlet, to, her, chamber, to, demand, an, explanation, meanwhile, claudius, talks, to, himself, about, the, impossibility, of, repenting, since, he, still, has, possession, of, his, ill, gotten, goods, his, brother, s, crown, and, wife, he, sinks, to, his, knees, hamlet, on, his, way, to, visit, his, mother, sneaks, up, behind, him, but, does, not, kill, him, reasoning, that, killing, claudius, while, he, is, praying, will, send, him, straight, to, heaven, while, his, father, s, ghost, is, stuck, in, purgatory, in, the, queen, s, bedchamber, hamlet, and, gertrude, fight, bitterly, polonius, spying, on, the, conversation, from, behind, a, tapestry, calls, for, help, as, gertrude, believing, hamlet, wants, to, kill, her, calls, out, for, help, herself, hamlet, believing, it, is, claudius, stabs, wildly, killing, polonius, but, he, pulls, aside, the, curtain, and, sees, his, mistake, in, a, rage, hamlet, brutally, insults, his, mother, for, her, apparent, ignorance, of, claudius, s, villainy, but, the, ghost, enters, and, reprimands, hamlet, for, his, inaction, and, harsh, words, unable, to, see, or, hear, the, ghost, herself, gertrude, takes, hamlet, s, conversation, with, it, as, further, evidence, of, madness, after, begging, the, queen, to, stop, sleeping, with, claudius, hamlet, leaves, dragging, polonius, s, corpse, away, hamlet, jokes, with, claudius, about, where, he, has, hidden, polonius, s, body, and, the, king, fearing, for, his, life, sends, rosencrantz, and, guildenstern, to, accompany, hamlet, to, england, with, a, sealed, letter, to, the, english, king, requesting, that, hamlet, be, executed, immediately, unhinged, by, grief, at, polonius, s, death, ophelia, wanders, elsinore, laertes, arrives, back, from, france, enraged, by, his, father, s, death, and, his, sister, s, madness, claudius, convinces, laertes, that, hamlet, is, solely, responsible, but, a, letter, soon, arrives, indicating, that, hamlet, has, returned, to, denmark, foiling, claudius, s, plan, claudius, switches, tactics, proposing, a, fencing, match, between, laertes, and, hamlet, to, settle, their, differences, laertes, will, be, given, a, poison, tipped, foil, and, if, that, fails, claudius, will, offer, hamlet, poisoned, wine, as, a, congratulation, gertrude, interrupts, to, report, that, ophelia, has, drowned, though, it, is, unclear, whether, it, was, suicide, or, an, accident, caused, by, her, madness, horatio, has, received, a, letter, from, hamlet, explaining, that, the, prince, escaped, by, negotiating, with, pirates, who, attempted, to, attack, his, england, bound, ship, and, the, friends, reunite, offstage, two, gravediggers, discuss, ophelia, s, apparent, suicide, while, digging, her, grave, hamlet, arrives, with, horatio, and, banters, with, one, of, the, gravediggers, who, unearths, the, skull, of, a, jester, from, hamlet, s, childhood, yorick, hamlet, picks, up, the, skull, saying, alas, poor, yorick, as, he, contemplates, mortality, ophelia, s, funeral, procession, approaches, led, by, laertes, hamlet, and, horatio, initially, hide, but, when, hamlet, realizes, that, ophelia, is, the, one, being, buried, he, reveals, himself, proclaiming, his, love, for, her, laertes, and, hamlet, fight, by, ophelia, s, graveside, but, the, brawl, is, broken, up, back, at, elsinore, hamlet, explains, to, horatio, that, he, had, discovered, claudius, s, letter, among, rosencrantz, and, guildenstern, s, belongings, and, replaced, it, with, a, forged, copy, indicating, that, his, former, friends, should, be, killed, instead, a, foppish, courtier, osric, interrupts, the, conversation, to, deliver, the, fencing, challenge, to, hamlet, hamlet, despite, horatio, s, pleas, accepts, it, hamlet, does, well, at, first, leading, the, match, by, two, hits, to, none, and, gertrude, raises, a, toast, to, him, using, the, poisoned, glass, of, wine, claudius, had, set, aside, for, hamlet, claudius, tries, to, stop, her, but, is, too, late, she, drinks, and, laertes, realizes, the, plot, will, be, revealed, laertes,

has, been, poisoned, dies, in, his, dying, moments, laertes, reconciles, with, hamlet, and, reveals, claudius, s, plan, hamlet, rushes, at, claudius, and, kills, him, as, the, poison, takes, effect, hamlet, hearing, that, fortinbras, is, marching, through, the, area, names, the, norwegian, prince, as, his, successor, horatio, distraught, at, the, thought, of, being, the, last, survivor, and, living, whilst, hamlet, does, not, says, he, will, commit, suicide, by, drinking, the, dregs, of, gertrude, s, poisoned, wine, but, hamlet, begs, him, to, live, on, and, tell, his, story, hamlet, dies, in, horatio, s, arms, proclaiming, the, rest, is, silence, fortinbras, who, was, ostensibly, marching, towards, poland, with, his, army, arrives, at, the, palace, along, with, an, english, ambassador, bringing, news, of, rosencrantz, and, guildenstern, s, deaths, horatio, promises, to, recount, the, full, story, of, what, happened, and, fortinbras, seeing, the, entire, danish, royal, family, dead, takes, the, crown, for, himself, and, orders, a, military, funeral, to, honour, hamlet, hamlet, like, legends, are, so, widely, found, for, example, in, italy, spain, scandinavia, byzantium, and, arabia, that, the, core, hero, as, fool, theme, is, possibly, indo, european, in, origin, several, ancient, written, precursors, to, hamlet, can, be, identified, the, first, is, the, anonymous, scandinavian, saga, of, hrolf, kraki, in, this, the, murdered, king, has, two, sons, hroar, and, helgi, who, spend, most, of, the, story, in, disguise, under, false, names, rather, than, feigning, madness, in, a, sequence, of, events, that, differs, from, shakespeare, s, the, second, is, the, roman, legend, of, brutus, recorded, in, two, separate, latin, works, its, hero, lucius, shining, light, changes, his, name, and, persona, to, brutus, dull, stupid, playing, the, role, of, a, fool, to, avoid, the, fate, of, his, father, and, brothers, and, eventually, slaying, his, family, s, killer, king, tarquinius, a, 17th, century, nordic, scholar, torfaeus, compared, the, icelandic, hero, aml, i, amlodi, and, the, hero, prince, ambales, from, the, ambales, saga, to, shakespeare, s, hamlet, similarities, include, the, prince, s, feigned, madness, his, accidental, killing, of, the, king, s, counsellor, in, his, mother, s, bedroom, and, the, eventual, slaying, of, his, uncle, many, of, the, earlier, legendary, elements, are, interwoven, in, the, 13th, century, life, of, amleth, latin, vita, amlethi, by, saxo, grammaticus, part, of, gesta, danorum, written, in, latin, it, reflects, classical, roman, concepts, of, virtue, and, heroism, and, was, widely, available, in, shakespeare, s, day, significant, parallels, include, the, prince, feigning, madness, his, mother, s, hasty, marriage, to, the, usurper, the, prince, killing, a, hidden, spy, and, the, prince, substituting, the, execution, of, two, retainers, for, his, own, a, reasonably, faithful, version, of, saxo, s, story, was, translated, into, french, in, 1570, by, fran, ois, de, belleforest, in, his, histoires, tragiques, belleforest, embellished, saxo, s, text, substantially, almost, doubling, its, length, and, introduced, the, hero, s, melancholy, according, to, one, theory, shakespeare, s, main, source, may, be, an, earlier, play, now, lost, known, today, as, the, ur, hamlet, possibly, written, by, thomas, kyd, or, by, shakespeare, the, ur, hamlet, would, have, existed, by, 1589, and, would, have, incorporated, a, ghost, shakespeare, s, company, the, chamberlain, s, men, may, have, purchased, that, play, and, performed, a, version, for, some, time, which, shakespeare, reworked, however, no, copy, of, the, ur, hamlet, has, survived, and, it, is, impossible, to, compare, its, language, and, style, with, the, known, works, of, any, of, its, putative, authors, in, 1936, andrew, cairncross, suggested, that, until, more, becomes, known, it, may, be, assumed, that, shakespeare, wrote, the, ur, hamlet, eric, sams, lists, reasons, for, supporting, shakespeare, s, authorship, harold, jenkins, considers, that, there, are, no, grounds, for, thinking, that, the, ur, hamlet, is, an, early, work, by, shakespeare, which, he, then, rewrote, professor, terri, bourus, in, 2016, one, of, three, general, editors, of, the, new, oxford, shakespeare, in, her, paper, enter, shakespeare, s, young, hamlet, 1589, suggests, that, shakespeare, was, interested, in, sixteenth, century, french, literature, from, the, very, beginning, of, his, career, and, therefore, did, not, need, thomas, kyd, to, pre, digest, belleforest, s, histoire, of, amleth, and, spoon, feed, it, to, him, she, considers, that, the, hypothesized, ur, hamlet, is, shakespeare, s, q1, text, and, that, this, derived, directly, from, belleforest, s, french, version, the, precise, combination, of, shakespeare, s, use, of, the, ur, hamlet, belleforest, saxo, or, kyd, s, the, spanish, tragedy, as, sources, for, hamlet, is, not, known, however, elements, of, belleforest, s, version, which, are, not, in, saxo, s, story, do, appear, in, shakespeare, s, play, most, scholars, reject, the, idea, that, hamlet, is, in, any, way, connected, with, shakespeare, s, only, son, hamnet, shakespeare, who, died, in, 1596, at, age, eleven, conventional, wisdom, holds, that, hamlet, is, too, obviously, connected, to, legend, and, the, name, hamnet, was, quite, popular, at, the, time, however, stephen, greenblatt, has, argued, that, the, coincidence, of, the, names, and, shakespeare, s, grief, for, the, loss, of, his, son, may, lie, at, the, heart, of, the, tragedy, he, notes, that, the, name, of, hamnet, sadler, the, stratford, neighbour, after, whom, hamnet, was, named, was, often, written, as, hamlet, sadler, and, that, in, the, loose, orthography, of, the, time, the, names, were, virtually, interchangeable, scholars, have, often, speculated, that, hamlet, s, polonius, might, have, been, inspired, by, william, cecil, lord, burghley, lord, high, treasurer, and, chief, counsellor, to, queen, elizabeth, i, e, k, chambers, suggested, polonius, s, advice, to, laertes, may, have, echoed, burghley, s, to, his, son, robert, cecil, john, dover, wilson, thought, it, almost, certain, that, the, figure, of, polonius, caricatured, burghley, a, l, rowse, speculated, that, polonius, s, tedious, verbosity, might, have, resembled, burghley, s, lilian, winstanley, thought, the, name, corambis, in, the, first, quarto, did, suggest, cecil, and, burghley, harold, jenkins, considers, the, idea, of, polonius, as, a, caricature, of, burghley, to, be, conjecture, perhaps, based, on, the, similar, role, they, each, played, at, court, and, perhaps, also, based, on, the, similarity, between, burghley, addressing, his, ten, precepts, to, his, son, and, polonius, offering, precepts, to, his, son, laertes, jenkins, suggests, that, any, personal, satire, may, be, found, in, the, name, polonius, which, might, point, to, a, polish, or, polonian, connection, g, r, hibbard, hypothesised, that, differences, in, names, corambis, polonius, montano, raynoldo, between, the, first, quarto, and, other, editions, might, reflect, a, desire, not, to, offend, scholars, at, oxford, university, robert, pullen, was, the, founder, of, oxford, university, and, john, rainolds, was, the, president, of, corpus, christi, college, any, dating, of, hamlet, must, be, tentative, states, the, new, cambridge, editor, phillip, edwards, maccary, suggests, 1599, or, 1600, james, shapiro, offers, late, 1600, or, early, 1601, wells, and, taylor, suggest, that, the, play, was, written, in, 1600, and, revised, later, the, new, cambridge, editor, settles, on, mid, 1601, the, new, swan, shakespeare, advanced, series, editor, agrees, with, 1601, thompson, and, taylor, tentatively, according, to, whether, one, is, the, more, persuaded, by, jenkins, or, by, honigmann, suggest, a, terminus, ad, quem, of, either, spring, 1601, or, sometime, in, 1600, the, earliest, date, estimate, relies, on, hamlet, s, frequent, allusions, to, shakespeare, s, julius, caesar, itself, dated, to, mid, 1599, the, latest, date, estimate, is, based, on, an, entry, of, 26, july, 1602, in, the, register, of, the, stationers, company, indicating, that, hamlet, was, latelie, acted, by, the, lo, chamberleyne, his, servantes, in, 1598, francis, meres, published, his, palladis, tamia, a, survey, of, english, literature, from, chaucer, to, its, present, day, within, which, twelve, of, shakespeare, s, plays, are, named, hamlet, is, not, among, them, suggesting, that, it, had, not, yet, been, written, as, hamlet, was, very, popular, bernard, lott, the, series, editor, of, new, swan, believes, it, unlikely, that, he, would, have, overlooked, so, significant, a, piece, the, phrase, little, eyases, in, the, first, folio, f1, may, allude, to, the, children, of, the, chapel, whose, popularity, in, london, forced, the, globe, company, into, provincial, touring, this, became, known, as, the, war, of, the, theatres, and, supports, a, 1601, dating, katherine, duncan, jones, accepts, a, 1600, 01, attribution, for, the, date, hamlet, was, written, but, notes, that, the, lord, chamberlain, s, men, playing, hamlet, in, the, 3000, capacity, globe, were, unlikely, to, be, put, to, any, disadvantage, by, an, audience, of, barely, one, hundred, for, the, children, of, the, chapel, s, equivalent, play, antonio, s, revenge, she, believes, that, shakespeare, confident, in, the, superiority, of, his, own, work, was, making, a, playful, and, charitable, allusion, to, his, friend, john, marston, s, very, similar, piece, a, contemporary, of, shakespeare, s, gabriel, harvey, wrote, a, marginal, note, in, his, copy, of, the, 1598, edition, of, chaucer, s, works, which, some, scholars, use, as, dating, evidence, harvey, s, note, says, that, the, wiser, sort, enjoy, hamlet, and, implies, that, the, earl, of, essex, executed, in, february, 1601, for, rebellion, was, still, alive, other, scholars, consider, this, inconclusive, edwards, for, example, concludes, that, the, sense, of, time, is, so, confused, in, harvey, s, note, that, it, is, really, of, little, use, in, trying, to, date, hamlet, this, is, because, the, same, note, also, refers, to, spenser, and, watson, as, if, they, were, still, alive, our, flourishing, metricians, but, also, mentions, owen, s, new, epigrams, published, in, 1607, three, early, editions, of, the, text, each, different, have, survived, making, attempts, to, establish, a, single, authentic, text, problematic, this, list, does, not, include, three, additional, early, texts, john, smethwick, s, q3, q4, and, q5, 1611, 37, which, are, regarded, as, reprints, of, q2, with, some, alterations, early, editors, of, shakespeare, s, works, beginning, with, nicholas, rowe, 1709, and, lewis, theobald, 1733, combined, material, from, the, two, earliest, sources, of, hamlet, available, at, the, time, q2, and, f1, each, text, contains, material, that, the, other, lacks, with, many, minor, differences, in, wording, scarcely, 200, lines, are, identical, in, the, two, editors, have, combined, them, in, an, effort, to, create, one, inclusive, text, that, reflects, an, imagined, ideal, of, shakespeare, s, original, theobald, s, version, became, standard, for, a, long, time, and, his, full, text, approach, continues, to, influence, editorial, practice, to, the, present, day, some, contemporary, scholarship, however, discounts, this, approach, instead, considering, an, authentic, hamlet, an, unrealisable, ideal, there, are, texts, of, this, play, but, no, text, the, 2006, publication, by, arden, shakespeare, of, different, hamlet, texts, in, different, volumes, is, perhaps, evidence, of, this, shifting, focus, and, emphasis, other, editors, have, continued, to, argue, the, need, for, well, edited, editions, taking, material, from, all, versions, of, the, play, colin, burrow, has, argued, that, most, of, us, should, read, a, text, that, is, made, up, by, conflating, all, three, versions, it, s, about, as, likely, that, shakespeare, wrote, to, be, or, not, to, be, ay, there, s, the, point, as, that, he, wrote, the, works, of, francis, bacon, i, suspect, most, people, just, won, t, want, to, read, a, three, text, play, a, version, of, the, play, that, is, out, of, touch, with, the, needs, of, a, wider, public, traditionally, editors, of, shakespeare, s, plays, have, divided, them, into, five, acts, none, of, the, early, texts, of, hamlet, however, were, arranged, this, way, and, the, play, s, division, into, acts, and, scenes, derives, from, a, 1676, quarto, modern, editors, generally, follow, this, traditional, division, but, consider, it, unsatisfactory, for, example, after, hamlet, drags, polonius, s, body, out, of, gertrude, s, bedchamber, there, is, an, act, break, after, which, the, action, appears, to, continue, uninterrupted, q1, was, discovered, in, 1823, only, two, copies, are, extant, according, to, jenkins, the, unauthorized, nature, of, this, quarto, is, matched, by, the, corruption, of, its, text, yet, q1, has, value, it, contains, stage, directions, such, as, ophelia, entering, with, a, lute, and, her, hair, down, that, reveal, actual, stage, practices, in, a, way, that, q2, and, f1, do, not, it, contains, an, entire, scene, usually, labelled, 4, 6, that, does, not, appear, in, either, q2, or, f1, and, it, is, useful, for, comparison, with, the, later, editions, the, major, deficiency, of, q1, is, in, the, language, particularly, noticeable, in, the, opening, lines, of, the, famous, to, be, or, not, to, be, soliloquy, to, be, or, not, to, be, aye, there, s, the, point, to, die, to, sleep, is, that, all, aye, all, no, to, sleep, to, dream, aye, marry, there, it, goes, however, the, scene, order, is, more, coherent, without, the, problems, of, q2, and, f1, of, hamlet, seeming, to, resolve, something, in, one, scene, and, enter, the, next, drowning, in, indecision, new, cambridge, editor, kathleen, irace, has, noted, that, q1, s, more, linear, plot, design, is, certainly, easier, to, follow, but, the, simplicity, of, the, q1, plot, arrangement, eliminates, the, alternating, plot, elements, that, correspond, to, hamlet, s, shifts, in, mood, q1, is, considerably, shorter, than, q2, or, f1, and, may, be, a, memorial, reconstruction, of, the, play, as, shakespeare, s, company, performed, it, by, an, actor, who, played, a, minor, role, most, likely, marcellus, scholars, disagree, whether, the, reconstruction, was, pirated, or, authorised, it, is, suggested, by, irace, that, q1, is, an, abridged, version, intended, especially, for, travelling, productions, thus, the, question, of, length, may, be, considered, as, separate, from, issues, of, poor, textual, quality, editing, q1, thus, poses, problems, in, whether, or, not, to, correct, differences, from, q2, and, f, irace, in, her, introduction, to, q1, wrote, that, i, have, avoided, as, many, other, alterations, as, possible, because, the, differences, are, especially, intriguing, i, have, recorded, a, selection, of, q2, f, readings, in, the, collation, the, idea, that, q1, is, not, riddled, with, error, but, is, instead, eminently, fit, for, the, stage, has, led, to, at, least, 28, different, q1, productions, since, 1881, other, productions, have, used, the, probably, superior, q2, and, folio, texts, but, used, q1, s, running, order, in, particular, moving, the, to, be, or, not, to, be, soliloquy, earlier, developing, this, some, editors, such, as, jonathan, bate, have, argued, that, q2, may, represent, a, reading, text, as, opposed, to, a, performance, one, of, hamlet, analogous, to, how, modern, films, released, on, disc, may, include, deleted, scenes, an, edition, containing, all, of, shakespeare, s, material, for, the, play, for, the, pleasure, of, readers, so, not, representing, the, play, as, it, would, have, been, staged, from, the, early, 17th, century, the, play, was, famous, for, its, ghost, and, vivid, dramatisation, of, melancholy, and, insanity, leading, to, a, procession, of, mad, courtiers, and, ladies, in, jacobean, and, caroline, drama, though, it, remained, popular, with, mass, audiences, late, 17th, century, restoration, critics, saw, hamlet, as, primitive, and, disapproved, of, its, lack, of, unity, and, decorum, this, view, changed, drastically, in, the, 18th, century, when, critics, regarded, hamlet, as, a, hero, a, pure, brilliant, young, man, thrust, into, unfortunate, circumstances, by, the, mid, 18th, century, however, the, advent, of, gothic, literature, brought, psychological, and, mystical, readings, returning, madness, and, the, ghost, to, the, forefront, not, until, the, late, 18th, century, did, critics, and, performers, begin, to, view, hamlet, as, confusing, and, inconsistent, before, then, he, was, either, mad, or, not, either, a, hero, or, not, with, no, in, betweens, these, developments, represented, a, fundamental, change, in, literary, criticism, which, came, to, focus, more, on, character, and, less, on, plot, in, the, 18th, century, one, negative, french, review, of, hamlet, would, be, widely, discussed, for, centuries, in, particular, in, publications, throughout, the, 19th, and, 20th, century, in, 1768, voltaire, wrote, a, negative, review, of, hamlet, stating, that, it, is, vulgar, and, barbarous, drama, which, would, not, be, tolerated, by, the, vilest, populace, of, france, or, italy, one, would, imagine, this, piece, to, be, a, work, of, a, drunken, savage, likewise, samuel, johnson, in, his, preface, to, shakespeare, praised, hamlet, s, variety, and, diversity, of, themes, especially, in, its, regard, to, human, emotion, by, the, 19th, century, romantic, critics, valued, hamlet, for, its, internal, individual, conflict, reflecting, the, strong, contemporary, emphasis, on, internal, struggles, and, inner, character, in, general, then, too, critics, started, to, focus, on, hamlet, s, delay, as, a, character, trait, rather, than, a, plot, device, this, focus, on, character, and, internal, struggle, continued, into, the, 20th, century, when, criticism, branched, in, several, directions, discussed, in, context, and, interpretation, below, modern, editors, have, divided, the, play, into, five, acts, and, each, act, into, scenes, the, first, folio, marks, the, first, two, acts, only, the, quartos, do, not, have, such, divisions, the, division, into, five,

the, plot, is, the, developing, revelation, of, hamlet, s, view, of, what, is, rotten, in, the, state, of, denmark, the, action, of, the, play, is, driven, forward, in, dialogue, but, in, the, soliloquies, time, and, action, stop, the, meaning, of, action, is, questioned, fog, of, illusion, is, broached, and, truths, are, exposed, the, contrast, between, appearance, and, reality, is, a,

continues, with, hamlet, s, taking, on, an, antic, disposition, in, order, to, appear, mad, though, he, is, not, the, contrast, appearance, and, reality, is, also, expressed, in, several, spying,

play, presents, the, affairs, of, the, courtier, polonius, his, daughter, ophelia, and, his, son, laertes, who, variously, deal, with, madness, love, and, the, death, of, a, father, in, ways, that, contrast, with, hamlet, s, the, graveyard, scene, eases, tension, prior, to, the, catastrophe, and, as, hamlet, holds, the, skull, it, is, shown, that, hamlet, no, longer, fears, damnation, in, the, afterlife, and, accepts, that, there, is, a, divinity, that, shapes, our, ends, hamlet, s, enquiring, mind, has, been, open, to, all, kinds, of, ideas, but, in, act, five, he, has, decided, on, a, plan, and, in, a, dialogue, with, horatio, he, seems, to, answer, his, two, earlier, soliloquies, on, suicide, we, defy, augury, there, is, special, providence, in, the, fall, of, a, sparrow, if, it,

602, words, counting, the, number, of, lines, varies, between, editions, partly, because, prose, sections, in, the, play, may, be, formatted, with, varied, lengths, editions, of, hamlet, that, are, created, by, conflating, the, texts, of, the, second, quarto, and, the, folio, are, said, to, have, approximately, 3, 900, lines, the, number, of, lines, varies, between, those, editions, based, on, formatting, the, prose, sections, counting, methods, and, how, the, editors, have, joined, the, texts, together, hamlet, is, by, far, the, longest, play, that, shakespeare, wrote, and, one, of, the, longest, plays, in, the, western, canon, it, might, require, more, than, four, hours, to, stage, a, typical, elizabethan, play, would, need, two, to, three, hours, it, is, speculated, that, because, of, the, considerable, length, of, q2, and, f1, there, was, an, expectation, that, those, texts, would, be, abridged, for, performance, or, that, q2, and, f1, may, have, been, aimed, at, a, reading, audience, that, q1, is, so, much, shorter, than, q2, has, spurred, speculation, that, q1, is, an, early, draft, or, perhaps, an, adaptation, a, bootleg, copy, or, a, stage, adaptation, on, the, title, page, of, q2, its, text, is, described, as, newly, imprinted, and, enlarged, to, almost, as, much, again, as, it, was, that, is, probably, a, comparison, to, q1, much, of, hamlet, s, language, is,

and, anaphora, mixed, with, metaphor, to, resonate, with, greek, political, speeches, of, all, the, characters, hamlet, has, the, greatest, rhetorical, skill, he, uses, highly, developed, metaphors, stichomythia, and, in, nine, memorable, words, deploys, both, anaphora, and, asyndeton, to, die, to, sleep, to, sleep, perchance, to, dream, in, contrast, when, occasion, demands, he, is, precise, and, straightforward, as, when, he, explains, his, inward, emotion, to, his, mother, but, i, have, that, within, which, passes, show, these, but, the, trappings, and, the, suits, of, woe, at, times, he, relies, heavily, on, puns, to, express, his, true, thoughts, while, simultaneously, concealing, them, pauline, kiernan, argues, that, shakespeare, changed, english, drama, forever, in, hamlet, because, he, showed, how, a, character, s, language, can, often, be, saying, several, things, at, once, and, contradictory, meanings, at, that, to, reflect, fragmented, thoughts, and, disturbed, feelings, she, gives, the, example, of, hamlet, s, advice, to, ophelia, get, thee, to, a, nunnery, which, she, claims, is, simultaneously, a, reference, to, a, place, of, chastity, and, a, slang, term, for, a, brothel, reflecting, hamlet, s, confused, feelings, about, female, sexuality, however, harold, jenkins, does, not, agree, having, studied, the, few, examples, that, are, used, to, support, that, idea, and, finds, that, there, is, no, support, for, the, assumption, that, nunnery, was, used, that, way, in, slang, or, that, hamlet, intended, such, a, meaning, the, context, of, the, scene, suggests, that, a, nunnery, would, not, be, a, brothel, but, instead, a, place, of, renunciation, and, a, sanctuary, from, marriage, and, from, the, world, s, contamination, thompson, and, taylor, consider, the, brothel, idea, incorrect, considering, that, hamlet, is, trying, to, deter, ophelia, from, breeding, hamlet, s, first, words, in, the, play, are, a, pun, when, claudius, addresses, him, as, my, cousin, hamlet, and, my, son, hamlet, says, as, an, aside, a, little, more, than, kin, and, less, than, kind, an, unusual, rhetorical, device, hendiadys, appears, in, several, places, in, the, play, examples, are, found, in, ophelia, s, speech, at, the, end, of, the, nunnery, scene, th, expectancy, and, rose, of, the, fair, state, and, and, i, of, ladies, most, deject, and, wretched, many, scholars, have, found, it, odd, that, shakespeare, would, seemingly, arbitrarily, use, this, rhetorical, form, throughout, the, play, one, explanation, may, be, that, hamlet, was, written, later, in, shakespeare, s, life, when, he, was, adept, at, matching, rhetorical, devices, to, characters, and, the, plot, linguist, george, t, wright, suggests, that, hendiadys, had, been, used, deliberately, to, heighten, the, play, s, sense, of, duality, and, dislocation, hamlet, s, soliloquies, have, also, captured, the, attention, of, scholars, hamlet, interrupts, himself, vocalising, either, disgust, or, agreement, with, himself, and, embellishing, his, own, words, he, has, difficulty, expressing, himself, directly, and, instead, blunts, the, thrust, of, his, thought, with, wordplay, it, is, not, until, late, in, the, play, after, his, experience, with, the, pirates, that, hamlet, is, able, to, articulate, his, feelings, freely, written, at, a, time, of, religious, upheaval, and, in, the, wake, of, the, english, reformation, the, play, is, alternately, catholic, or, piously, medieval, and, protestant, or, consciously, modern, the, ghost, describes, himself, as, being, in, purgatory, and, as, dying, without, last, rites, this, and, ophelia, s, burial, ceremony, which, is, characteristically, catholic, make, up, most, of, the, play, s, catholic, connections, some, scholars, have, observed, that, revenge, tragedies, come, from, catholic, countries, such, as, italy, and, spain, where, the, revenge, tragedies, present, contradictions, of, motives, since, according, to, catholic, doctrine, the, duty, to, god, and, family, precedes, civil, justice, hamlet, s, conundrum, then, is, whether, to, avenge, his, father, and, kill, claudius, or, to, leave, the, vengeance, to, god, as, his, religion, requires, much, of, the, play, s, protestant, tones, derive, from, its, setting, in, denmark, both, then, and, now, a, predominantly, protestant, country, though, it, is, unclear, whether, the, fictional, denmark, of, the, play, is, intended, to, portray, this, implicit, fact, dialogue, refers, explicitly, to, the, german, city, of, wittenberg, where, hamlet, horatio, and, rosencrantz, and, guildenstern, attend, university, implying, where, the, protestant, reformer, martin, luther, nailed, the, ninety, five, theses, to, the, church, door, in, 1517, hamlet, is, often, perceived, as, a, philosophical, character, expounding, ideas, that, are, now, described, as, relativist, existentialist, and, sceptical, for, example, he, expresses, a, subjectivistic, idea, when, he, says, to, rosencrantz, there, is, nothing, either, good, or, bad, but, thinking, makes, it, so, the, idea, that, nothing, is, real, except, in, the, mind, of, the, individual, finds, its, roots, in, the, greek, sophists, who, argued, that, since, nothing, can, be, perceived, except, through, the, senses, and, since, all, individuals, sense, and, therefore, perceive, things, differently, there, is, no, absolute, truth, but, rather, only, relative, truth, the, clearest, alleged, instance, of, existentialism, is, in, the, to, be, or, not, to, be, speech, where, hamlet, is, thought, by, some, to, use, being, to, allude, to, life, and, action, and, not, being, to, death, and, inaction, hamlet, reflects, the, contemporary, scepticism, promoted, by, the, french, renaissance, humanist, michel, de, montaigne, prior, to, montaigne, s, time, humanists, such, as, pico, della, mirandola, had, argued, that, man, was, god, s, greatest, creation, made, in, god, s, image, and, able, to, choose, his, own, nature, but, this, view, was, subsequently, challenged, in, montaigne, s, essais, of, 1580, hamlet, s, what, a, piece, of, work, is, a, man, seems, to, echo, many, of, montaigne, s, ideas, and, many, scholars, have, discussed, whether, shakespeare, drew, directly, from, montaigne, or, whether, both, men, were, simply, reacting, similarly, to, the, spirit, of, the, times, sigmund, freud, s, thoughts, regarding, hamlet, were, first, published, in, his, book, the, interpretation, of, dreams, 1899, as, a, footnote, to, a, discussion, of, sophocles, tragedy, oedipus, rex, all, of, which, is, part, of, his, consideration, of, the, causes, of, neurosis, freud, does, not, offer, over, all, interpretations, of, the, plays, but, uses, the, two, tragedies, to, illustrate, and, corroborate, his, psychological, theories, which, are, based, on, his, treatments, of, his, patients, and, on, his, studies, productions, of, hamlet, have, used, freud, s, ideas, to, support, their, own, interpretations, in, the, interpretation, of, dreams, freud, says, that, according, to, his, experience, parents, play, a, leading, part, in, the, infantile, psychology, of, all, persons, who, subsequently, become, psychoneurotics, and, that, falling, in, love, with, one, parent, and, hating, the, other, is, a, common, impulse, in, early, childhood, and, is, important, source, material, of, subsequent, neurosis, he, says, that, in, their, amorous, or, hostile, attitude, toward, their, parents, neurotics, reveal, something, that, occurs, with, less, intensity, in, the, minds, of, the, majority, of, children, freud, considered, that, sophocles, tragedy, oedipus, rex, with, its, story, that, involves, crimes, of, parricide, and, incest, has, furnished, us, with, legendary, matter, which, corroborates, these, ideas, and, that, the, profound, and, universal, validity, of, the, old, legends, is, understandable, only, by, recognizing, the, validity, of, these, theories, of, infantile, psychology, freud, explores, the, reason, oedipus, rex, is, capable, of, moving, a, modern, reader, or, playgoer, no, less, powerfully, than, it, moved, the, contemporary, greeks, he, suggests, that, it, may, be, that, we, were, all, destined, to, direct, our, first, sexual, impulses, toward, our, mothers, and, our, first, impulses, of, hatred, and, violence, toward, our, fathers, freud, suggests, that, we, recoil, from, the, person, for, whom, this, primitive, wish, of, our, childhood, has, been, fulfilled, with, all, the, force, of, the, repression, which, these, wishes, have, undergone, in, our, minds, since, childhood, these, ideas, which, became, a, cornerstone, of, freud, s, psychological, theories, he, named, the, oedipus, complex, and, at, one, point, he, considered, calling, it, the, hamlet, complex, freud, considered, that, hamlet, is, rooted, in, the, same, soil, as, oedipus, rex, but, the, difference, in, the, psychic, life, of, the, two, civilizations, that, produced, each, play, and, the, progress, made, over, time, of, repression, in, the, emotional, life, of, humanity, can, be, seen, in, the, way, the, same, material, is, handled, by, the, two, playwrights, in, oedipus, rex, incest, and, murder, are, brought, into, the, light, as, might, occur, in, a, dream, but, in, hamlet, these, impulses, remain, repressed, and, we, learn, of, their, existence, through, hamlet, s, inhibitions, to, act, out, the, revenge, while, he, is, shown, to, be, capable, of, acting, decisively, and, boldly, in, other, contexts, freud, asserts, the, play, is, based, on, hamlet, s, hesitation, in, accomplishing, the, task, of, revenge, assigned, to, him, the, text, does, not, give, the, cause, or, the, motive, of, this, the, conflict, is, deeply, hidden, hamlet, is, able, to, perform, any, kind, of, action, except, taking, revenge, on, the, man, who, murdered, his, father, and, has, taken, his, father, s, place, with, his, mother, claudius, has, led, hamlet, to, realize, the, repressed, desires, of, his, own, childhood, the, loathing, which, was, supposed, to, drive, him, to, revenge, is, replaced, by, self, reproach, by, conscientious, scruples, which, tell, him, he, himself, is, no, better, than, the, murderer, whom, he, is, required, to, punish, freud, suggests, that, hamlet, s, sexual, aversion, expressed, in, his, nunnery, conversation, with, ophelia, supports, the, idea, that, hamlet, is, an, hysterical, subject, freud, suggests, that, the, character, hamlet, goes, through, an, experience, that, has, three, characteristics, which, he, numbered, 1, the, hero, is, not, psychopathic, but, becomes, so, during, the, course, of, the, play, 2, the, repressed, desire, is, one, of, those, that, are, similarly, repressed, in, all, of, us, it, is, a, repression, that, belongs, to, an, early, stage, of, our, individual, development, the, audience, identifies, with, the, character, of, hamlet, because, we, are, victims, of, the, same, conflict, 3, it, is, the, nature, of, theatre, that, the, struggle, of, the, repressed, impulse, to, become, conscious, occurs, in, both, the, hero, onstage, and, the, spectator, when, they, are, in, the, grip, of, their, emotions, in, the, manner, seen, in, psychoanalytic, treatment, freud, points, out, that, hamlet, is, an, exception, in, that, psychopathic, characters, are, usually, ineffective, in, stage, plays, they, become, as, useless, for, the, stage, as, they, are, for, life, itself, because, they, do, not, inspire, insight, or, empathy, unless, the, audience, is, familiar, with, the, character, s, inner, conflict, freud, says, it, is, thus, the, task, of, the, dramatist, to, transport, us, into, the, same, illness, john, barrymore, s, long, running, 1922, performance, in, new, york, directed, by, thomas, hopkins, broke, new, ground, in, its, freudian, approach, to, character, in, keeping, with, the, post, world, war,

biographer, developed, freud, s, ideas, into, a, series, of, essays, that, culminated, in, his, book, hamlet, and, oedipus, 1949, influenced, by, jones, s, psychoanalytic, approach, several, productions, have, portrayed, the, closet, scene, where, hamlet, confronts, his, mother, in, her, private, quarters, in, a, sexual, light, in, this, reading, hamlet, is, disgusted, by, his, mother, s, incestuous, relationship, with, claudius, while, simultaneously, fearful, of, killing, him, as, this, would, clear, hamlet, s, path, to, his, mother, s, bed, ophelia, s, madness, after, her, father, s, death, may, also, be, read, through, the, freudian, lens, as, a, reaction, to, the, death, of, her, hoped, for, lover, her, father, ophelia, is, overwhelmed, by, having, her, unfulfilled, love,

conviction, that, the, intentions, of, shakespeare, in, portraying, the, character, of, hamlet, in, the, play, exceeded, the, capacity, of, the, freudian, oedipus, complex, to, completely, encompass, the, extent, of, characteristics, depicted, in, hamlet, throughout, the, tragedy, for, once, freud, regressed, in, attempting, to, fasten, the, oedipus, complex, upon, hamlet, it, will, not, stick, and, merely, showed, that, freud, did, better, than, t, s, eliot, who, preferred, coriolanus, to, hamlet, or, so, he, said, who, can, believe, eliot, when, he, exposes, his, own, hamlet, complex, by,

a, misnomer, it, should, be, called, the, hamlet, complex, in, the, 1950s, the, french, psychoanalyst, jacques, lacan, analyzed, hamlet, to, illustrate, some, of, his, concepts, his, structuralist, theories, about, hamlet, were, first, presented, in, a, series, of, seminars, given, in, paris, and, later, published, in, desire, and, the, interpretation, of, desire, in, hamlet, lacan, postulated, that, the, human, psyche, is, determined, by, structures, of, language, and, that, the, linguistic, structures, of, hamlet, shed, light, on, human, desire, his, point, of, departure, is, freud, s, oedipal, theories, and, the, central, theme, of, mourning, that, runs, through, hamlet, in, lacan, s, analysis, hamlet, unconsciously, assumes, the, role, of, phallus, the, cause, of, his, inaction, and, is, increasingly, distanced, from, reality, by, mourning, fantasy, narcissism, and, psychosis, which, create, holes, or, lack, in, the, real, imaginary, and, symbolic, aspects, of, his, psyche,

common, trinity, of, maid, wife, or, widow, with, whores, outside, of, that, stereotype, in, this, analysis, the, essence, of, hamlet, is, the, central, character, s, changed, perception, of, his, mother, as, a, whore, because, of, her, failure, to, remain, faithful, to, old, hamlet, in, consequence, hamlet, loses, his, faith, in, all, women, treating, ophelia, as, if, she, too, were, a, whore, and, dishonest, with, hamlet, ophelia, by, some, critics, can, be, seen, as, honest, and, fair, however, it, is, virtually, impossible, to, link, these, two, traits, since, fairness, is, an, outward, trait, while, honesty, is, an, inward, trait, carolyn, heilbrun, s, 1957, essay, the, character, of, hamlet, s, mother, defends, gertrude, arguing, that, the, text, never, hints, that, gertrude, knew,

this, account, gertrude, s, worst, crime, is, of, pragmatically, marrying, her, brother, in, law, in, order, to, avoid, a, power, vacuum, this, is, borne, out, by, the, fact, that, king, hamlet, s,
