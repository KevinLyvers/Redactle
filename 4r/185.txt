sharon, left, alone, with, the, man, goes, to, him, and, has, him, drink, her, breast, milk, many, scholars, have, noted, steinbeck, s, use, of, christian, imagery, within, the, grapes, of, wrath, the, largest, implications, lie, with, tom, joad, and, jim, casy, who, are, both, interpreted, as, christ, like, figures, at, certain, intervals, within, the, novel, these, two, are, often, interpreted, together, with, casy, representing, jesus, christ, in, the, early, days, of, his, ministry, up, until, his, death, which, is, interpreted, as, representing, the, death, of, christ, from, there, tom, takes, over, rising, in, casy, s, place, as, the, christ, figure, risen, from, the, dead, however, the, religious, imagery, is, not, limited, to, these, two, characters, scholars, have, regularly, inspected, other, characters, and, plot, points, within, the, novel, including, ma, joad, rose, of, sharon, her, stillborn, child, and, uncle, john, in, an, article, first, published, in, 2009, ken, eckert, even, compared, the, migrants, movement, west, as, a, reversed, version, of, the, slaves, escape, from, egypt, in, exodus, many, of, these, extreme, interpretations, are, brought, on, by, steinbeck, s, own, documented, beliefs, which, eckert, himself, refers, to, as, unorthodox, to, expand, upon, previous, remarks, in, a, journal, leonard, a, slade, lays, out, the, chapters, and, how, they, represent, each, part, of, the, slaves, escaping, from, egypt, slade, states, chapters, 1, through, 10, correspond, to, bondage, in, egypt, where, the, bank, and, land, companies, fulfill, the, role, of, pharaoh, and, the, plagues, drought, and, erosion, chapters, 11, through, 18, to, the, exodus, and, journey, through, the, wilderness, during, which, the, old, people, die, off, and, chapter, 19, through, 30, to, the, settlement, in, the, promised, land, california, whose, inhabitants, are, hostile, formulate, ethical, codes, in, the, government, camps, another, religious, interpretation, that, slade, brings, up, in, his, writings, is, the, title, itself, stating, the, title, of, the, novel, of, course, refers, to, the, line, he, is, trampling, out, the, vintage, where, the, grapes, of, wrath, are, stored, in, julia, ward, howe, s, famous, battle, hymn, of, the, republic, apparently, then, the, title, suggests, moreover, that, story, exists, in, christian, context, indicating, that, we, should, expect, to, find, some, christian, meaning, these, two, interpretations, by, slade, and, other, scholars, show, how, many, religious, aspects, can, be, interpreted, from, the, book, along, with, slade, other, scholars, find, interpretations, in, the, characters, of, rose, of, sharon, and, her, stillborn, child, this, is, the, beginning, from, i, to, we, if, you, who, own, the, things, people, must, have, could, understand, this, you, might, preserve, yourself, if, you, could, separate, causes, from, results, if, you, could, know, that, paine, marx, jefferson, lenin, were, results, not, causes, you, might, survive, but, that, you, cannot, know, for, the, quality, of, owning, freezes, you, forever, into, i, and, cuts, you, off, forever, from, the, we, steinbeck, was, known, to, have, borrowed, from, field, notes, taken, during, 1938, by, farm, security, administration, worker, and, author, sanora, babb, while, she, collected, personal, stories, about, the, lives, of, the, displaced, migrants, for, a, novel, she, was, developing, her, supervisor, tom, collins, shared, her, reports, with, steinbeck, who, at, the, time, was, working, for, the, san, francisco, news, babb, s, own, novel, whose, names, are, unknown, was, eclipsed, in, 1939, by, the, success, of, the, grapes, of, wrath, and, was, shelved, until, it, was, finally, published, in, 2004, a, year, before, babb, s, death, the, grapes, of, wrath, developed, from, the, harvest, gypsies, a, series, of, seven, articles, that, ran, in, the, san, francisco, news, from, october, 5, to, 12, 1936, the, newspaper, commissioned, that, work, on, migrant, workers, from, the, midwest, in, california, s, agriculture, industry, it, was, later, compiled, and, published, separately, in, mid, january, 1939, three, months, before, the, publication, of, the, grapes, of, wrath, steinbeck, wrote, a, long, letter, to, pascal, covici, his, editor, at, viking, press, he, wanted, covici, in, particular, to, understand, this, book, to, appreciate, what, he, was, up, to, and, so, he, concluded, with, a, statement, that, might, serve, as, preface, in, and, of, itself, throughout, i, ve, tried, to, make, the, reader, participate, in, the, actuality, what, he, takes, from, it, will, be, scaled, on, his, own, depth, and, shallowness, there, are, five, layers, in, this, book, a, reader, will, find, as, many, as, he, can, and, he, won, t, find, more, than, he, has, in, himself, while, writing, the, novel, at, his, home, 16250, greenwood, lane, in, what, is, now, monte, sereno, california, steinbeck, had, unusual, difficulty, devising, a, title, the, grapes, of, wrath, suggested, by, his, wife, carol, steinbeck, was, deemed, more, suitable, than, anything, by, the, author, the, title, is, a, reference, to, lyrics, from, the, battle, hymn, of, the, republic, by, julia, ward, howe, emphasis, added, mine, eyes, have, seen, the, glory, of, the, coming, of, the, lord, he, is, trampling, out, the, vintage, where, the, grapes, of, wrath, are, stored, he, hath, loosed, the, fateful, lightning, of, his, terrible, swift, sword, his, truth, is, marching, on, these, lyrics, refer, in, turn, to, the, biblical, passage, revelation, 14, 19, 20, an, apocalyptic, appeal, to, divine, justice, and, deliverance, from, oppression, in, the, final, judgment, this, and, other, biblical, passages, had, inspired, a, long, tradition, of, imagery, of, christ, in, the, winepress, in, various, media, the, passage, reads, and, the, angel, thrust, in, his, sickle, into, the, earth, and, gathered, the, vine, of, the, earth, and, cast, it, into, the, great, winepress, of, the, wrath, of, god, and, the, winepress, was, trodden, without, the, city, and, blood, came, out, of, the, winepress, even, unto, the, horse, bridles, by, the, space, of, a, thousand, and, six, hundred, furlongs, the, phrase, also, appears, at, the, end, of, chapter, 25, in, steinbeck, s, book, which, describes, the, purposeful, destruction, of, food, to, keep, the, price, high, nd, in, the, eyes, of, the, hungry, there, is, a, growing, wrath, in, the, souls, of, the, people, the, grapes, of, wrath, are, filling, and, growing, heavy, growing, heavy, for, the, vintage, the, image, invoked, by, the, title, serves, as, a, crucial, symbol, in, the, development, of, both, the, plot, and, the, novel, s, greater, thematic, concerns, from, the, terrible, winepress, of, dust, bowl, oppression, will, come, terrible, wrath, but, also, the, deliverance, of, workers, through, their, cooperation, this, is, suggested, but, not, realized, within, the, novel, when, preparing, to, write, the, novel, steinbeck, wrote, i, want, to, put, a, tag, of, shame, on, the, greedy, bastards, who, are, responsible, for, this, he, famously, said, i, ve, done, my, damnedest, to, rip, a, reader, s, nerves, to, rags, his, work, won, a, large, following, among, the, working, class, due, to, his, sympathy, for, the, migrants, and, workers, movement, and, his, accessible, prose, style, steinbeck, scholar, john, timmerman, sums, up, the, book, s, influence, the, grapes, of, wrath, may, well, be, the, most, thoroughly, discussed, novel, in, criticism, reviews, and, college, classrooms, of, 20th, century, american, literature, the, grapes, of, wrath, is, referred, to, as, a, great, american, novel, at, the, time, of, publication, steinbeck, s, novel, was, a, phenomenon, on, the, scale, of, a, national, event, it, was, publicly, banned, and, burned, by, citizens, it, was, debated, on, national, radio, but, above, all, it, was, read, according, to, the, new, york, times, it, was, the, best, selling, book, of, 1939, and, 430, 000, copies, had, been, printed, by, february, 1940, in,

fiction, and, its, armed, services, edition, went, through, two, printings, the, book, was, noted, for, steinbeck, s, passionate, depiction, of, the, plight, of, the, poor, and, many, of, his, contemporaries, attacked, his, social, and, political, views, bryan, cordyack, wrote, steinbeck, was, attacked, as, a, propagandist, and, a, socialist, from, both, the, left, and, the, right, of, the, political, spectrum, the, most, fervent, of, these, attacks, came, from, the, associated, farmers, of, california, they, were, displeased, with, the, book, s, depiction, of, california, farmers, attitudes, and, conduct, toward, the, migrants, they, denounced, the, book, as, a, pack, of, lies, and, labeled, it, communist, propaganda, some, argued, that, his, novel, was, filled, with, inaccuracies, in, his, book, the, art, of, fiction, 1984, john, gardner, criticized, steinbeck, for, not, knowing, anything, about, the, california, ranchers, witness, steinbeck, s, failure, in, the, grapes, of, wrath, it, should, have, been, one, of, america, s, great, books, teinbeck, wrote, not, a, great, and, firm, novel, but, a, disappointing, melodrama, in, which, complex, good, is, pitted, against, unmitigated, unbelievable, evil, others, accused, steinbeck, of, exaggerating, camp, conditions, to, make, a, political, point, he, had, visited, the, camps, well, before, publication, of, the, novel, and, argued, their, inhumane, nature, destroyed, the, settlers, spirit, in, 1962, the, nobel, prize, committee, cited, the, grapes, of, wrath, as, a, great, work, and, as, one, of, the, committee, s, main, reasons, for, granting, steinbeck, the, nobel, prize, for, literature, in, 1999, french, newspaper, le, monde, of, paris, ranked, the, grapes, of, wrath, as, seventh, on, its,

political, and, religious, grounds, in, the, united, states, and, other, countries, the, early, attempts, to, suppress, and, censor, the, book, directly, inspired, the, promulgation, of, the, library, bill, of, rights, by, the, american, library, association, sanora, babb, s, whose, names, are, unknown, was, written, in, the, 1930s, and, published, in, 2004, some, scholars, noted, strong, parallels, between, that, work, the, notes, for, which, steinbeck, is, widely, believed, to, have, examined, and, the, grapes, of, wrath, writing, in, the, steinbeck, review, michael, j, meyer, noted, numerous, obvious, similarities, between, the, two, novels, that, even, a, cursory, reading, will, reveal, such, as, babb, s, account, of, two, still, born, babies, mirrored, in, steinbeck, s, description, of, rose, of, sharon, s, baby, among, other, scenes, and, themes, repeated, in, both, books, the, villainy, of, banks, corporations, and, company, stores, that, charge, exorbitant, prices, the, rejection, of, religion, and, the, embrace, of, music, as, a, means, of, preserving, hope, descriptions, of, the, fecundity, of, nature, and, agriculture, and, the, contrast, with, the, impoverishment, of, the, migrants, and, the, disparity, between, those, willing, to, extend, assistance, to, the, migrants, and, others, who, view, okies, as, subhuman, meyer, a, steinbeck, bibliographer, stops, short, of, labeling, these, parallels, as, plagiarism, but, concludes, that, steinbeck, scholars, would, do, well, to, read, babb, if, only, to, see, for, themselves, the, echoes, of, grapes, that, abound, in, her, prose, steinbeck, scholar, david, m, wrobel, wrote, that, the, john, steinbeck, sanora, babb, story, sounds, like, a, classic, smash, and, grab, celebrated, california, author, steals, the, material, of, unknown, oklahoma, writer, resulting, in, his, financial, success, and, her, failure, to, get, her, work, published, steinbeck, absorbed, field, information, from, many, sources, primarily, tom, collins, and, eric, h, thomsen, regional, director, of, the, federal, migrant, camp, program, in, california, who, accompanied, steinbeck, on, missions, of, mercy, if, steinbeck, read, babb, s, extensive, notes, as, carefully, as, he, did, the, reports, of, collins, he, would, certainly, have, found, them, useful, his, interaction, with, collins, and, thomsen, and, their, influence, on, the, writing, of, the, grapes, of, wrath, is, documented, because, steinbeck, acknowledged, both, sanora, babb, went, unmentioned, writing, in, broad, street, magazine, carla, dominguez, described, babb, as, devastated, and, bitter, that, random, house, cancelled, publication, of, her, own, novel, after, the, grapes, of, wrath, was, released, in, 1939, it, is, clear, she, wrote, that, babb, s, retellings, interactions, and, reflections, were, secretly, read, over, and, appropriated, by, steinbeck, babb, met, steinbeck, briefly, and, by, chance, at, a, lunch, counter, but, she, never, thought, that, he, had, been, reading, her, notes, because, he, did, not, mention, it, when, babb, s, novel, was, finally, published, in, 2004, she, declared, that, she, was, a, better, writer, than, steinbeck, his, book, babb, said, is, not, as, realistic, as, mine, the, book, was, quickly, made, into, a, famed, 1940, hollywood, movie, of, the, same, name, directed, by, john, ford, and, starring, henry, fonda, as, tom, joad, the, first, part, of, the, film, version, follows, the, book, fairly, accurately, however, the, second, half, and, the, ending, in, particular, differ, significantly, from, the, book, john, springer, author, of, the, fondas, citadel, 1973, said, of, henry, fonda, and, his, role, in, the, grapes, of, wrath, the,
