gothic, art, was, a, style, of, medieval, art, that, developed, in, northern, france, out, of, romanesque, art, in, the, 12th, century, ad, led, by, the, concurrent, development, of, gothic, architecture, it, spread, to, all, of, western, europe, and, much, of, northern, southern, and, central, europe, never, quite, effacing, more, classical, styles, in, italy, in, the, late, 14th, century, the, sophisticated, court, style, of, international, gothic, developed, which, continued, to, evolve, until, the, late, 15th, century, in, many, areas, especially, germany, late, gothic, art, continued, well, into, the, 16th, century, before, being, subsumed, into, renaissance, art, primary, media, in, the, gothic, period, included, sculpture, panel, painting, stained, glass, fresco, and, illuminated, manuscripts, the, easily, recognizable, shifts, in, architecture, from, romanesque, to, gothic, and, gothic, to, renaissance, styles, are, typically, used, to, define, the, periods, in, art, in, all, media, although, in, many, ways, figurative, art, developed, at, a, different, pace, the, earliest, gothic, art, was, monumental, sculpture, on, the, walls, of, cathedrals, and, abbeys, christian, art, was, often, typological, in, nature, see, medieval, allegory, showing, the, stories, of, the, new, testament, and, the, old, testament, side, by, side, saints, lives, were, often, depicted, images, of, the, virgin, mary, changed, from, the, byzantine, iconic, form, to, a, more, human, and, affectionate, mother, cuddling, her, infant, swaying, from, her, hip, and, showing, the, refined, manners, of, a, well, born, aristocratic, courtly, lady, secular, art, came, into, its, own, during, this, period, with, the, rise, of, cities, foundation, of, universities, increase, in, trade, the, establishment, of, a, money, based, economy, and, the, creation, of, a, bourgeois, class, who, could, afford, to, patronize, the, arts, and, commission, works, resulting, in, a, proliferation, of, paintings, and, illuminated, manuscripts, increased, literacy, and, a, growing, body, of, secular, vernacular, literature, encouraged, the, representation, of, secular, themes, in, art, with, the, growth, of, cities, trade, guilds, were, formed, and, artists, were, often, required, to, be, members, of, a, painters, guild, as, a, result, because, of, better, record, keeping, more, artists, are, known, to, us, by, name, in, this, period, than, any, previous, some, artists, were, even, so, bold, as, to, sign, their, names, gothic, art, emerged, in, le, de, france, france, in, the, early, 12th, century, at, the, abbey, church, of, st, denis, built, by, abbot, suger, the, style, rapidly, spread, beyond, its, origins, in, architecture, to, sculpture, both, monumental, and, personal, in, size, textile, art, and, painting, which, took, a, variety, of, forms, including, fresco, stained, glass, the, illuminated, manuscript, and, panel, painting, monastic, orders, especially, the, cistercians, and, the, carthusians, were, important, builders, who, disseminated, the, style, and, developed, distinctive, variants, of, it, across, europe, regional, variations, of, architecture, remained, important, even, when, by, the, late, 14th, century, a, coherent, universal, style, known, as, international, gothic, had, evolved, which, continued, until, the, late, 15th, century, and, beyond, in, many, areas, although, there, was, far, more, secular, gothic, art, than, is, often, thought, today, as, generally, the, survival, rate, of, religious, art, has, been, better, than, for, secular, equivalents, a, large, proportion, of, the, art, produced, in, the, period, was, religious, whether, commissioned, by, the, church, or, by, the, laity, gothic, art, was, often, typological, in, nature, reflecting, a, belief, that, the, events, of, the, old, testament, pre, figured, those, of, the, new, and, that, this, was, indeed, their, main, significance, old, and, new, testament, scenes, were, shown, side, by, side, in, works, like, the, speculum, humanae, salvationis, and, the, decoration, of, churches, the, gothic, period, coincided, with, a, great, resurgence, in, marian, devotion, in, which, the, visual, arts, played, a, major, part, images, of, the, virgin, mary, developed, from, the, byzantine, hieratic, types, through, the, coronation, of, the, virgin, to, more, human, and, intimate, types, and, cycles, of, the, life, of, the, virgin, were, very, popular, artists, like, giotto, fra, angelico, and, pietro, lorenzetti, in, italy, and, early, netherlandish, painting, brought, realism, and, more, natural, humanity, to, art, western, artists, and, their, patrons, became, much, more, confident, in, innovative, iconography, and, much, more, originality, is, seen, although, copied, formulae, were, still, used, by, most, artists, iconography, was, affected, by, changes, in, theology, with, depictions, of, the, assumption, of, mary, gaining, ground, on, the, older, death, of, the, virgin, and, in, devotional, practices, such, as, the, devotio, moderna, which, produced, new, treatments, of, christ, in, subjects, such, as, the, man, of, sorrows, pensive, christ, and, piet, which, emphasized, his, human, suffering, and, vulnerability, in, a, parallel, movement, to, that, in, depictions, of, the, virgin, even, in, last, judgements, christ, was, now, usually, shown, exposing, his, chest, to, show, the, wounds, of, his, passion, saints, were, shown, more, frequently, and, altarpieces, showed, saints, relevant, to, the, particular, church, or, donor, in, attendance, on, a, crucifixion, or, enthroned, virgin, and, child, or, occupying, the, central, space, themselves, this, usually, for, works, designed, for, side, chapels, over, the, period, many, ancient, iconographical, features, that, originated, in, new, testament, apocrypha, were, gradually, eliminated, under, clerical, pressure, like, the, midwives, at, the, nativity, though, others, were, too, well, established, and, considered, harmless, the, word, gothic, for, art, was, initially, used, as, a, synonym, for, barbaric, and, was, therefore, used, pejoratively, its, critics, saw, this, type, of, medieval, art, as, unrefined, and, too, remote, from, the, aesthetic, proportions, and, shapes, of, classical, art, renaissance, authors, believed, that, the, sack, of, rome, by, the, gothic, tribes, in, 410, had, triggered, the, demise, of, the, classical, world, and, all, the, values, they, held, dear, in, the, 15th, century, various, italian, architects, and, writers, complained, that, the, new, barbarian, styles, filtering, down, from, north, of, the, alps, posed, a, similar, threat, to, the, classical, revival, promoted, by, the, early, renaissance, the, gothic, qualifier, for, this, art, was, first, used, in, raphael, s, letter, to, pope, leo, x, c, 1518, and, was, subsequently, popularised, by, the, italian, artist, and, writer, giorgio, vasari, who, used, it, as, early, as, 1530, calling, gothic, art, a, monstrous, and, barbarous, disorder, raphael, claimed, that, the, pointed, arches, of, northern, architecture, were, an, echo, of, the, primitive, huts, the, germanic, forest, dwellers, formed, by, bending, trees, together, a, myth, which, would, resurface, much, later, in, a, more, positive, sense, in, the, writings, of, the, german, romantic, movement, gothic, art, was, strongly, criticized, by, french, authors, such, as, boileau, la, bruy, re, rousseau, before, becoming, a, recognized, form, of, art, and, the, wording, becoming, fixed, moli, re, would, famously, comment, on, gothic, the, besotted, taste, of, gothic, monuments, these, odious, monsters, of, ignorant, centuries, which, the, torrents, of, barbary, spewed, forth, in, its, beginning, gothic, art, was, initially, called, french, work, opus, francigenum, thus, attesting, the, priority, of, france, in, the, creation, of, this, style, painting, in, the, gothic, style, did, not, exist, until, around, 1200, over, 50, years, after, the, beginnings, of, gothic, architecture, and, sculpture, the, transition, from, romanesque, to, gothic, is, very, imprecise, and, not, at, all, a, clear, break, and, gothic, ornamental, detailing, is, often, introduced, before, much, change, is, seen, in, the, style, of, figures, or, compositions, themselves, then, figures, become, more, animated, in, pose, and, facial, expression, tend, to, be, smaller, in, relation, to, the, background, of, scenes, and, are, arranged, more, freely, in, the, pictorial, space, where, there, is, room, this, transition, occurs, first, in, england, and, france, around, 1200, in, germany, around, 1220, and, italy, around, 1300, painting, during, the, gothic, period, was, practiced, in, four, primary, media, frescos, panel, paintings, manuscript, illumination, and, stained, glass, frescos, continued, to, be, used, as, the, main, pictorial, narrative, craft, on, church, walls, in, southern, europe, as, a, continuation, of, early, christian, and, romanesque, traditions, an, accident, of, survival, has, given, denmark, and, sweden, the, largest, groups, of, surviving, church, wall, paintings, in, the, biblia, pauperum, style, usually, extending, up, to, recently, constructed, cross, vaults, in, both, denmark, and, sweden, they, were, almost, all, covered, with, limewash, after, the, reformation, which, has, preserved, them, but, some, have, also, remained, untouched, since, their, creation, among, the, finest, examples, from, denmark, are, those, of, the, elmelunde, master, from, the, danish, island, of, m, n, who, decorated, the, churches, of, fanefjord, keldby, and, elmelunde, albertus, pictor, is, arguably, the, most, well, known, fresco, artist, from, the, period, working, in, sweden, examples, of, swedish, churches, with, well, preserved, frescos, include, tensta, g, khem, and, anga, churches, in, northern, europe, stained, glass, was, an, important, and, prestigious, form, of, painting, until, the, 15th, century, when, it, became, supplanted, by, panel, painting, gothic, architecture, greatly, increased, the, amount, of, glass, in, large, buildings, partly, to, allow, for, wide, expanses, of, glass, as, in, rose, windows, in, the, early, part, of, the, period, mainly, black, paint, and, clear, or, brightly, coloured, glass, was, used, but, in, the, early, 14th, century, the, use, of, compounds, of, silver, painted, on, glass, which, was, then, fired, allowed, a, number, of, variations, of, colour, centred, on, yellows, to, be, used, with, clear, glass, in, a, single, piece, by, the, end, of, the, period, designs, increasingly, used, large, pieces, of, glass, which, were, painted, with, yellows, as, the, dominant, colours, and, relatively, few, smaller, pieces, of, glass, in, other, colours, illuminated, manuscripts, represent, the, most, complete, record, of, gothic, painting, providing, a, record, of, styles, in, places, where, no, monumental, works, have, otherwise, survived, the, earliest, full, manuscripts, with, french, gothic, illustrations, date, to, the, middle, of, the, 13th, century, many, such, illuminated, manuscripts, were, royal, bibles, although, psalters, also, included, illustrations, the, parisian, psalter, of, saint, louis, dating, from, 1253, to, 1270, features, 78, full, page, illuminations, in, tempera, paint, and, gold, leaf, during, the, late, 13th, century, scribes, began, to, create, prayer, books, for, the, laity, often, known, as, books, of, hours, due, to, their, use, at, prescribed, times, of, the, day, among, the, earliest, is, an, example, by, william, de, brailes, that, seems, to, have, been, written, for, an, unknown, laywoman, living, in, a, small, village, near, oxford, in, about, 1240, nobility, frequently, purchased, such, texts, paying, handsomely, for, decorative, illustrations, among, the, most, well, known, creators, of, these, is, jean, pucelle, whose, hours, of, jeanne, d, evreux, was, commissioned, by, king, charles, iv, as, a, gift, for, his, queen, jeanne, d, vreux, elements, of, the, french, gothic, present, in, such, works, include, the, use, of, decorative, page, framing, reminiscent, of, the, architecture, of, the, time, with, elongated, and, detailed, figures, the, use, of, spatial, indicators, such, as, building, elements, and, natural, features, such, as, trees, and, clouds, also, denote, the, french, gothic, style, of, illumination, from, the, middle, of, the, 14th, century, blockbooks, with, both, text, and, images, cut, as, woodcut, seem, to, have, been, affordable, by, parish, priests, in, the, low, countries, where, they, were, most, popular, by, the, end, of, the, century, printed, books, with, illustrations, still, mostly, on, religious, subjects, were, rapidly, becoming, accessible, to, the, prosperous, middle, class, as, were, engravings, of, fairly, high, quality, by, printmakers, like, israhel, van, meckenem, and, master, e, s, in, the, 15th, century, the, introduction, of, cheap, prints, mostly, in, woodcut, made, it, possible, even, for, peasants, to, have, devotional, images, at, home, these, images, tiny, at, the, bottom, of, the, market, often, crudely, coloured, were, sold, in, thousands, but, are, now, extremely, rare, most, having, been, pasted, to, walls, painting, with, oil, on, canvas, did, not, become, popular, until, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, and, was, a, hallmark, of, renaissance, art, in, northern, europe, the, important, and, innovative, school, of, early, netherlandish, painting, is, in, an, essentially, gothic, style, but, can, also, be, regarded, as, part, of, the, northern, renaissance, as, there, was, a, long, delay, before, the, italian, revival, of, interest, in, classicism, had, a, great, impact, in, the, north, painters, like, robert, campin, and, jan, van, eyck, made, use, of, the, technique, of, oil, painting, to, create, minutely, detailed, works, correct, in, perspective, where, apparent, realism, was, combined, with, richly, complex, symbolism, arising, precisely, from, the, realistic, detail, they, could, now, include, even, in, small, works, in, early, netherlandish, painting, from, the, richest, cities, of, northern, europe, a, new, minute, realism, in, oil, painting, was, combined, with, subtle, and, complex, theological, allusions, expressed, precisely, through, the, highly, detailed, settings, of, religious, scenes, the, m, rode, altarpiece, 1420s, of, robert, campin, and, the, washington, van, eyck, annunciation, or, madonna, of, chancellor, rolin, both, 1430s, by, jan, van, eyck, are, examples, for, the, wealthy, small, panel, paintings, even, polyptychs, in, oil, painting, were, becoming, increasingly, popular, often, showing, donor, portraits, alongside, though, often, much, smaller, than, the, virgin, or, saints, depicted, these, were, usually, displayed, in, the, home, the, gothic, period, is, essentially, defined, by, gothic, architecture, and, does, not, entirely, fit, with, the, development, of, style, in, sculpture, in, either, its, start, or, finish, the, facades, of, large, churches, especially, around, doors, continued, to, have, large, tympanums, but, also, rows, of, sculpted, figures, spreading, around, them, the, statues, on, the, western, royal, portal, at, chartres, cathedral, c, 1145, show, an, elegant, but, exaggerated, columnar, elongation, but, those, on, the, south, transept, portal, from, 1215, 20, show, a, more, naturalistic, style, and, increasing, detachment, from, the, wall, behind, and, some, awareness, of, the, classical, tradition, these, trends, were, continued, in, the, west, portal, at, reims, cathedral, of, a, few, years, later, where, the, figures, are, almost, in, the, round, as, became, usual, as, gothic, spread, across, europe, bamberg, cathedral, has, perhaps, the, largest, assemblage, of, 13th, century, sculpture, culminating, in, 1240, with, the, bamberg, rider, the, first, life, size, equestrian, statue, in, western, art, since, the, 6th, century, in, italy, the, gospel, of, gothic, was, preached, from, pulpits, not, from, tympana, and, the, unit, of, the, sculptor, s, thinking, was, an, autonomous, self, consistent, work, of, art, john, pope, hennessy, nicola, pisano, 1258, 78, and, his, son, giovanni, developed, a, style, that, is, often, called, proto, renaissance, with, unmistakable, influence, from, roman, sarcophagi, and, sophisticated, and, crowded, compositions, including, a, sympathetic, handling, of, nudity, in, relief, panels, on, their, pulpit, of, siena, cathedral, 1265, 68, pulpit, in, the, pisa, baptistery, the, fontana, maggiore, in, perugia, and, giovanni, s, pulpit, in, pistoia, of, 1301, another, revival, of, classical, style, is, seen, in, the, international, gothic, work, of, claus, sluter, and, his, followers, in, burgundy, and, flanders, around, 1400, late, gothic, sculpture, continued, in, the, north, with, a, fashion, for, very, large, wooden, sculpted, altarpieces, with, increasingly, virtuoso, carving, and, large, numbers, agitated, expressive, figures, most, surviving, examples, are, in, germany, after, much, iconoclasm, elsewhere, tilman, riemenschneider, veit, stoss, and, others, continued, the, style, well, into, the, 16th, century, gradually, absorbing, italian, renaissance, influences, life, size, tomb, effigies, in, stone, or, alabaster, became, popular, for, the, wealthy, and, grand, multi, level, tombs, evolved, with, the, scaliger, tombs, of, verona, so, large, they, had, to, be, moved, outside, the, church, by, the, 15th, century, there, was, an, industry, exporting, nottingham, alabaster, altar, reliefs, in, groups, of, panels, over, much, of, europe, for, economical, parishes, who, could, not, afford, stone, retables, small, carvings, for, a, mainly, lay, and, often, female, market, became, a, considerable, industry, in, paris, and, some, other, centres, types, of, ivories, included, small, devotional, polyptychs, single, figures, especially, of, the, virgin, mirror, cases, combs, and, elaborate, caskets, with, scenes, from, romances, used, as, engagement, presents, the, very, wealthy, collected, extravagantly, elaborate, jewelled, and, enamelled, metalwork, both, secular, and, religious, like, the, duc, de, berry, s, holy, thorn, reliquary, until, they, ran, short, of, money, when, they, were, melted, down, again, for, cash, gothic, sculptures, independent, of, architectural, ornament, were, primarily, created, as, devotional, objects, for, the, home, or, intended, as, donations, for, local, churches, although, small, reliefs, in, ivory, bone, and, wood, cover, both, religious, and, secular, subjects, and, were, for, church, and, domestic, use, these, sculptures, were, created, by, urban, artisans, and, the, most, common, theme, for, three, dimensional, small, statues, is, the, virgin, mary, alone, or, with, a, child, paris, was, the, main, centre, of, ivory, workshops, and, exported, to, most, of, northern, europe, though, italy, also, had, a, considerable, production, an, exemplar, of, these, independent, sculptures, is, among, the, collections, of, the, abbey, church, of, st, denis, the, silver, gilt, virgin, and, child, dates, to, 1339, and, features, mary, enveloped, in, a, flowing, cloak, holding, an, infantile, christ, figure, both, the, simplicity, of, the, cloak, and, the, youth, of, the, child, presage, other, sculptures, found, in, northern, europe, dating, to, the, 14th, century, and, early, 15th, century, such, sculpture, shows, an, evolution, from, an, earlier, stiff, and, elongated, style, still, partly, romanesque, into, a, spatial, and, naturalistic, feel, in, the, late, 12th, and, early, 13th, century, other, french, gothic, sculptural, subjects, included, figures, and, scenes, from, popular, literature, of, the, time, imagery, from, the, poetry, of, the, troubadours, was, particularly, popular, among, artisans, of, mirror, cases, and, small, boxes, presumably, for, use, by, women, the, casket, with, scenes, of, romances, walters, 71264, of, 1330, 50, is, an, unusually, large, example, with, space, for, a, number, of, scenes, from, different, literary, sources, souvenirs, of, pilgrimages, to, shrines, such, as, clay, or, lead, badges, medals, and, ampullae, stamped, with, images, were, also, popular, and, cheap, their, secular, equivalent, the, livery, badge, showed, signs, of, feudal, and, political, loyalty, or, alliance, that, came, to, be, regarded, as, a, social, menace, in, england, under, bastard, feudalism, the, cheaper, forms, were, sometimes, given, away, free, as, with, the, 13, 000, badges, ordered, in, 1483, by, king, richard, iii, of, england, in, fustian, cloth, with, his, emblem, of, a, white, boar, for, the, investiture, of, his, son, edward, as, prince, of, wales, a, huge, number, given, the, population, at, the, time, the, dunstable, swan, jewel, modelled, fully, in, the, round, in, enamelled, gold, is, a, far, more, exclusive, version, that, would, have, been, given, to, someone, very, close, or, important, to, the, donor
