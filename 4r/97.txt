historical, romance, novels, many, of, them, paperback, originals, were, published, selling, over, 40, million, copies, the, success, of, these, novels, prompted, a, new, style, of, writing, romance, concentrating, primarily, on, historical, fiction, tracking, the, monogamous, relationship, between, a, helpless, heroine, and, the, hero, who, rescued, her, even, if, he, had, been, the, one, to, place, her, in, danger, the, covers, of, these, novels, tended, to, feature, scantily, clad, women, being, grabbed, by, the, hero, and, caused, the, novels, to, be, referred, to, as, bodice, rippers, cover, arts, of, this, style, are, referred, to, as, clinch, covers, a, wall, street, journal, article, in, 1980, referred, to, these, bodice, rippers, as, publishing, s, answer, to, the, big, mac, they, are, juicy, cheap, predictable, and, devoured, in, stupefying, quantities, by, legions, of, loyal, fans, the, term, bodice, ripper, is, now, considered, offensive, to, many, in, the, romance, industry, in, this, new, style, of, historical, romance, heroines, were, independent, and, strong, willed, and, were, often, paired, with, heroes, who, evolved, into, caring, and, compassionate, men, who, truly, admired, the, women, they, loved, this, was, in, contrast, to, the, contemporary, romances, published, during, this, time, which, were, often, characterized, by, weak, females, who, fell, in, love, with, overbearing, alpha, males, although, these, heroines, had, active, roles, in, the, plot, they, were, passive, in, relationships, with, the, heroes, across, the, genre, heroines, during, this, time, were, usually, aged, 16, 21, with, the, heroes, slightly, older, usually, around, 30, the, women, were, virgins, while, the, men, were, not, and, both, members, of, the, couple, were, described, as, beautiful, category, romance, lines, were, slower, to, react, to, some, of, the, changes, that, had, swept, the, historical, romance, subgenre, despite, the, fact, that, the, former, mills, boon, lines, were, now, owned, by, a, north, american, company, the, lines, did, not, have, any, american, writers, until, 1975, when, harlequin, purchased, a, novel, by, janet, dailey, dailey, s, novels, provided, the, romance, genre, s, first, look, at, heroines, heroes, and, courtships, that, take, place, in, america, with, american, sensibilities, assumptions, history, and, most, of, all, settings, harlequin, was, unsure, how, the, market, would, react, to, this, new, type, of, romance, and, was, unwilling, to, fully, embrace, it, in, the, late, 1970s, a, harlequin, editor, rejected, a, manuscript, by, nora, roberts, who, has, since, become, the, top, selling, romance, author, because, they, already, had, their, american, writer, harlequin, sold, almost, 70, million, of, its, paperback, romances, in, 1979, through, 100, 000, supermarkets, and, other, stores, giving, the, company, almost, 10, of, the, market, for, paperback, books, that, year, the, company, began, distributing, its, own, books, in, the, united, states, instead, of, through, simon, schuster, s, pocket, books, in, 1980, simon, schuster, formed, silhouette, books, to, publish, its, own, romance, novels, beginning, what, the, new, york, times, called, perhaps, the, most, bitter, war, in, american, book, publishing, history, the, company, sought, to, take, advantage, of, the, untapped, talent, of, the, american, writers, they, published, several, lines, of, category, romance, and, encouraged, their, writers, to, create, stronger, heroines, and, less, dominant, heroes, authors, were, also, expected, to, address, contemporary, issues, where, appropriate, silhouette, soon, saw, their, market, share, expand, and, in, 1984, harlequin, acquired, them, despite, the, acquisition, silhouette, continued, to, retain, editorial, control, and, to, publish, various, lines, under, their, own, imprint, harlequin, had, also, failed, to, adapt, quickly, to, the, signs, that, readers, appreciated, novels, with, more, explicit, sex, scenes, and, in, 1980, several, publishers, entered, the, category, romance, market, to, fill, that, gap, that, year, dell, launched, their, candlelight, ecstasy, line, with, amii, lorin, s, the, tawny, gold, man, becoming, the, first, line, to, waive, the, requirement, that, heroines, be, virgins, by, the, end, of, 1983, sales, for, the, candlelight, ecstasy, line, totaled, 30, million, silhoeutte, also, launched, similar, lines, desire, sexually, explicit, and, special, edition, sexually, explicit, and, longer, stories, up, to, 250, pages, each, of, which, had, a, 90, 100, sellout, rate, each, month, a, 1982, survey, of, romance, readers, confirmed, that, the, new, styles, of, writing, were, attracting, new, readers, to, the, genre, 35, of, the, readers, surveyed, had, begun, reading, romances, after, 1977, an, additional, 31, of, those, surveyed, had, been, readers, for, between, 6, and, 10, years, meaning, they, had, become, interested, in, the, genre, after, 1972, when, woodiwiss, revolutionary, novel, was, published, this, means, that, two, thirds, of, those, surveyed, joined, the, genre, after, it, had, begun, to, change, the, number, of, category, romance, lines, increased, at, a, rapid, pace, and, by, 1985, there, were, 16, separate, lines, producing, a, total, of, 80, novels, per, month, the, sudden, increase, in, category, romance, lines, meant, an, equally, sudden, increase, in, demand, for, writers, of, the, new, style, of, romance, novel, this, tight, market, caused, a, proportionate, decrease, in, the, quality, of, the, novels, that, were, being, released, by, 1984, the, market, was, saturated, with, category, lines, and, readers, had, begun, to, complain, of, redundancy, in, plots, the, following, year, the, dampening, effect, of, the, high, level, of, redundancy, associated, with, series, romances, was, evident, in, the, decreased, number, of, titles, being, read, per, month, harlequin, s, return, rate, which, had, been, less, than, 25, in, 1978, when, it, was, the, primary, provider, of, category, romance, swelled, to, 60, the, genre, continued, to, expand, in, the, mid, to, late, 1980s, as, publishers, realized, that, the, more, popular, authors, were, often, those, who, stretched, the, boundaries, of, the, genre, a, 1984, novel, by, lavyrle, spencer, featured, an, overweight, middle, aged, hero, who, had, to, make, drastic, changes, to, his, lifestyle, to, win, the, heroine, while, a, 1987, dailey, novel, involved, an, ugly, hero, and, a, heroine, who, was, searching, for, her,

relationships, had, also, modernized, by, the, 1990s, it, was, rare, to, see, a, book, that, featured, a, man, raping, his, future, wife, in, the, mid, to, late, 1980s, contemporary, romances, began, to, feature, women, in, more, male, dominated, jobs, such, as, offshore, oil, rigs, and, the, space, program, the, age, range, of, heroines, also, began, to, expand, so, that, books, began, to, feature, women, who, had, already, reached, 30, and, even, 40, heroes, also, changed, with, some, authors, veering, towards, a, more, sensitive, man, despite, the, broadening, of, some, aspects, of, the, plot, other, taboos, remained, and, publishers, discouraged, authors, from, writing, about, controversial, subjects, such, as, terrorism, warfare, and, masculine, sports, romance, novels, began, to, contain, more, humor, beginning, in, the, 1990s, as, julie, garwood, began, introducing, a, great, deal, of, humor, into, her, historical, romances, the, romance, novel, began, to, expand, in, other, ways, as, well, in, 1989, author, jude, deveraux, became, the, first, romance, author, to, transition, from, writing, original, mass, market, paperbacks, to, being, published, in, hardcover, her, novel, a, knight, in, shining, armor, became, a, natural, bestseller, several, authors, found, success, writing, single, title, romances, set, in, contemporary, times, and, publishing, houses, began, to, encourage, the, growth, in, the, genre, because, the, novels, were, set, in, modern, times, they, could, include, more, of, the, elements, that, modern, women, could, relate, to, and, soon, began, to, touch, on, themes, such, as, single, parenthood, adoption, and, abuse, the, 21st, century, brought, additional, changes, to, the, genre, that, included, diversifying, main, characters, and, plots, to, incorporate, identities, that, had, not, previously, been, represented, scholars, of, romance, novel, history, have, observed, that, characters, with, disabilities, have, been, largely, underrepresented, in, mainstream, media, including, romance, novels, by, the, early, 2000s, though, more, books, in, the, romance, genre, featured, heroes, and, heroines, with, physical, and, mental, impairments, mary, balogh, s, simply, love, published, in, 2006, features, a, hero, with, facial, scarring, and, nerve, damage, who, overcomes, fears, of, rejection, due, to, his, physical, appearance, to, enter, a, romantic, relationship, and, family, unit, by, the, end, of, the, novel, this, was, a, substantial, shift, from, past, narratives, where, disabled, characters, were, de, eroticized, and, not, given, storylines, that, included, sex, or, romantic, love, additionally, autistic, characters, have, gained, more, representation, in, the, romance, genre, since, the, turn, of, the, century, the, year, 2010, saw, christine, feehan, s, novel, water, bound, featuring, a, heroine, with, autism, as, a, significant, plot, point, including, a, detailed, and, compassionate, portrayal, of, living, and, coping, with, autism, helen, hoang, s, 2018, novel, the, kiss, quotient, for, example, focuses, on, the, heroine, s, asperger, s, syndrome, however, it, is, still, rare, to, find, romance, novels, in, which, there, are, characters, with, cognitive, disabilities, and, they, are, most, likely, to, be, included, as, secondary, characters, since, the, 1980s, many, plot, lines, that, were, once, thought, to, be, taboo, by, the, romance, publishing, industry, have, become, much, more, accepted, into, the, mainstream, of, romance, fiction, for, example, in, the, 20th, century, it, was, rare, to, find, a, book, with, a, hero, who, was, in, the, military, or, professional, sports, in, the, 21st, century, however, such, characters, are, relatively, common, and, even, have, their, own, sub, genres, within, the, romance, category, by, 2000, the, covers, had, begun, to, evolve, from, featuring, a, scantily, clad, couple, to, showing, a, view, of, the, landscape, featured, in, the, novel, in, the, earliest, harlequin, romance, novels, heroines, were, typically, nurses, and, secretaries, but, as, time, has, passed, and, women, have, entered, the, workforce, in, larger, numbers, romance, heroines, have, spanned, the, career, spectrum, modern, romance, novels, now, feature, more, balanced, relationships, between, men, and, women, some, important, literary, figures, received, critical, acclaim, for, their, romance, novels, for, instance, the, nobel, laureate, gabriel, garc, a, m, rquez, received, critical, praise, for, his, romance, novel, love, in, the, time, of, cholera, arthur, schopenhauer, held, that, if, poets, and, novelists, across, continents, have, not, stopped, producing, romance, novels, since, millennia, it, is, because, no, other, topic, is, more, relevant, and, so, the, theme, never, gets, old, according, to, schopenhauer, romance, love, is, more, important, than, other, topics, because, it, affects, the, species, not, only, the, individual, in, the, sense, that, romance, and, partner, choice, is, generally, a, prerequisite, to, have, offspring, and, continue, maintaining, the, human, species, in, future, generations, of, humankind, despite, recent, rehabilitation, and, merging, of, the, genre, with, other, genres, there, is, sometimes, a, negative, stigma, with, the, romance, novel, some, dedicated, readers, are, embarrassed, to, admit, to, buying, or, even, reading, the, books, the, romance, genre, has, sometimes, generated, criticism, some, critics, point, to, a, lack, of, suspense, as, it, may, seem, obvious, that, the, hero, and, heroine, will, eventually, resolve, their, issues, and, wonder, whether, it, is, beneficial, for, women, to, be, whiling, away, so, many, hours, reading, impossibly, glamorized, love, stories, according, to, fiction, author, melissa, pritchard, a, romance, novel, perpetuates, something, slightly, dangerous, that, there, s, this, notion, that, there, s, this, perfect, love, out, there, and, it, can, distract, you, from, the, work, of, loving, yourself, romance, novelists, attribute, the, stigma, to, the, fact, that, romance, is, according, to, some, a, genre, written, almost, exclusively, by, women, for, women, romance, novelist, jennifer, crusie, counters, that, in, the, modern, romance, novel, a, woman, is, rewarded, with, unconditional, love, if, she, remains, true, to, herself, while, novelist, susan, elizabeth, phillips, believes, that, romance, novels, are, popular, because, the, heroine, typically, wins, sometimes, overcoming, great, odds, so, that, she, is, no, longer, a, victim, peer, reviewed, academic, scholarship, examining, romance, novels, has, increased, enormously, in, the, last, few, decades, scholars, are, analysing, the, significance, and, impact, of, the, genre, increasingly, from, a, feminist, gender, and, equity, studies, perspective, the, profile, of, the, romance, genre, has, also, been, raised, by, the, financial, and, critical, success, of, the, adaptations, of, two, successful, series, of, novels, outlander, by, diana, gabaldon, and, bridgerton, by, julia, quinn, by, paid, television, network, starz, and, streaming, service, netflix, debates, about, whether, these, novels, fall, inside, or, outside, the, contemporary, romance, genre, and, the, extent, to, which, they, transcend, the, genre, to, be, multi, genre, has, received, mainstream, media, attention, in, part, due, to, gabaldon, s, frequent, and, prominent, assertions, that, her, outlander, series, is, not, romance, fiction, however, both, scholarly, analysis, and, the, conversations, between, gabaldon, and, her, publisher, about, whether, to, market, the, books, as, romances, reveal, that, the, discourse, about, genre, labels, is, more, nuanced, in, 2022, it, was, announced, that, the, best, selling, cult, winston, brother, series, by, self, published, smart, romance, author, penny, reid, has, been, optioned, for,
