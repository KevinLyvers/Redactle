a, studio, system, is, a, method, of, filmmaking, wherein, the, production, and, distribution, of, films, is, dominated, by, a, small, number, of, large, movie, studios, it, is, most, often, used, in, reference, to, hollywood, motion, picture, studios, during, the, early, years, of, the, golden, age, of, hollywood, from, 1927, the, introduction, of, sound, motion, pictures, to, 1948, the, beginning, of, the, demise, of, the, studio, system, wherein, studios, produced, films, primarily, on, their, own, filmmaking, lots, with, creative, personnel, under, often, long, term, contract, and, dominated, exhibition, through, vertical, integration, i, e, the, ownership, or, effective, control, of, distributors, and, exhibition, guaranteeing, additional, sales, of, films, through, manipulative, booking, techniques, such, as, block, booking, during, the, hollywood, golden, age, eight, companies, constituted, the, major, studios, that, promulgated, the, hollywood, studio, system, of, these, eight, five, were, fully, integrated, conglomerates, known, as, the, original, big, five, combining, ownership, of, a, production, studio, distribution, division, and, substantial, theater, chain, and, contracting, with, performers, and, filmmaking, personnel, metro, goldwyn, mayer, owned, by, loews, incorporated, owner, of, america, s, largest, theater, chain, paramount, pictures, warner, bros, 20th, century, fox, later, renamed, 20th, century, studios, after, its, disney, acquisition, brought, back, the, big, five, for, the, first, time, since, then, and, rko, radio, pictures, also, at, this, time, two, of, the, little, three, major, minors, columbia, pictures, and, universal, pictures, were, similarly, organized, though, without, more, than, small, theater, circuits, and, the, third, united, artists, owned, a, small, number, of, theaters, and, had, access, to, two, production, facilities, owned, by, members, of, its, controlling, partnership, group, but, it, functioned, primarily, as, a, backer, distributor, financing, independent, productions, and, releasing, their, films, the, studio, system, was, challenged, under, the, antitrust, laws, in, a, 1948, supreme, court, ruling, which, sought, to, separate, production, from, the, distribution, and, exhibition, and, ended, such, practices, thereby, hastening, the, end, of, the, studio, system, by, 1954, with, television, competing, for, audience, and, the, last, of, the, operational, links, between, a, major, production, studio, and, theater, chain, broken, the, historic, era, of, the, studio, system, was, over, the, years, 1927, and, 1928, are, generally, seen, as, the, beginning, of, hollywood, s, golden, age, and, the, final, major, steps, in, establishing, studio, system, control, of, the, american, film, business, the, success, of, 1927, s, the, jazz, singer, the, first, feature, length, talkie, in, fact, the, majority, of, its, scenes, did, not, have, live, recorded, sound, gave, a, big, boost, to, the, then, midsized, warner, bros, studio, the, following, year, saw, both, the, general, introduction, of, sound, throughout, the, industry, and, two, more, smashes, for, warners, the, singing, fool, the, jazz, singer, s, even, more, profitable, follow, up, and, hollywood, s, first, all, talking, feature, lights, of, new, york, just, as, significant, were, a, number, of, offscreen, developments, warner, bros, now, flush, with, income, acquired, the, extensive, stanley, theater, chain, in, september, 1928, one, month, later, it, purchased, a, controlling, interest, in, the, first, national, production, company, more, prominent, than, warners, itself, not, long, before, with, the, first, national, acquisition, came, not, only, a, 135, acre, 55, ha, studio, and, backlot, but, another, large, string, of, movie, theaters, the, last, of, the, big, five, hollywood, conglomerates, of, the, golden, age, emerged, in, 1928, rko, pictures, the, radio, corporation, of, america, rca, led, by, david, sarnoff, was, looking, for, ways, to, exploit, the, cinema, sound, patents, newly, trademarked, rca, photophone, owned, by, its, parent, company, general, electric, as, the, leading, film, production, companies, were, all, preparing, to, sign, exclusive, agreements, with, western, electric, for, their, technology, rca, got, into, the, movie, business, itself, in, january, general, electric, acquired, a, sizable, interest, in, film, booking, offices, of, america, fbo, a, distributor, and, small, production, company, owned, by, joseph, p, kennedy, father, of, future, president, john, f, kennedy, in, october, through, a, set, of, stock, transfers, rca, gained, control, of, both, fbo, and, the, keith, albee, orpheum, theater, chain, merging, them, into, a, single, venture, it, created, the, radio, keith, orpheum, corporation, sarnoff, chairing, the, board, with, rko, and, warner, bros, soon, to, become, warner, bros, first, national, joining, fox, paramount, and, loew, s, mgm, as, major, players, the, big, five, that, would, remain, for, thirty, years, were, now, in, place, although, rko, was, an, exception, the, heads, of, studios, on, the, west, coast, the, movie, moguls, had, mostly, been, in, place, for, some, years, louis, b, mayer, at, mgm, jack, l, warner, at, warner, bros, adolph, zukor, at, paramount, william, fox, and, darryl, f, zanuck, at, 20th, century, fox, from, 1935, carl, laemmle, at, universal, and, harry, cohn, at, columbia, the, ranking, of, the, big, five, in, terms, of, profitability, closely, related, to, market, share, was, largely, consistent, during, the, golden, age, mgm, was, number, one, eleven, years, running, 1931, 41, paramount, the, most, profitable, studio, of, the, early, sound, era, 1928, 30, faded, for, the, better, part, of, the, subsequent, decade, and, fox, was, number, two, for, most, of, mgm, s, reign, paramount, began, a, steady, climb, in, 1940, finally, edging, past, mgm, two, years, later, from, then, until, its, reorganization, in, 1949, it, was, again, the, most, financially, successful, of, the, big, five, with, the, exception, of, 1932, when, all, the, companies, but, mgm, lost, money, and, rko, lost, somewhat, less, than, its, competitors, rko, was, next, to, last, or, usually, last, every, year, of, the, golden, age, with, warner, generally, hanging, alongside, at, the, back, of, the, pack, of, the, smaller, majors, the, little, three, united, artists, reliably, held, up, the, rear, with, columbia, strongest, in, the, 1930s, and, universal, ahead, for, most, of, the, 1940s, hollywood, s, success, grew, during, the, great, depression, possibly, because, films, helped, audiences, escape, their, personal, difficulties, president, franklin, delano, roosevelt, said, of, shirley, temple, when, the, spirit, of, the, people, is, lower, than, at, any, other, time, during, this, depression, it, is, a, splendid, thing, that, for, just, fifteen, cents, an, american, can, go, to, a, movie, and, look, at, the, smiling, face, of, a, baby, and, forget, his, troubles, by, 1939, there, were, 15, 000, movie, theaters, in, the, united, states, more, than, banks, the, number, of, theaters, per, capita, was, twice, that, of, the, mid, 1980s, the, cinema, industry, was, larger, than, that, for, office, machines, while, only, the, 14th, largest, by, revenue, it, was, second, in, the, percentage, of, profits, that, its, executives, received, top, stars, such, as, bing, crosby, and, claudette, colbert, were, paid, more, than, 400, 000, a, year, 8, 761, 722, today, one, of, the, techniques, used, to, support, the, studio, system, was, block, booking, a, system, of, selling, multiple, films, to, a, theater, as, a, unit, such, a, unit, five, films, was, the, standard, practice, for, most, of, the, 1940s, typically, included, only, one, particularly, outstanding, film, the, rest, a, mix, of, a, budget, pictures, of, lesser, quality, and, b, movies, as, life, magazine, wrote, in, 1957, in, a, retrospective, on, the, studio, system, it, wasn, t, good, entertainment, and, it, wasn, t, art, and, most, of, the, movies, produced, had, a, uniform, mediocrity, but, they, were, also, uniformly, profitable, the, million, dollar, mediocrity, was, the, very, backbone, of, hollywood, on, may, 4, 1948, in, a, federal, antitrust, suit, known, as, the, paramount, case, brought, against, the, entire, big, five, the, u, s, supreme, court, specifically, outlawed, block, booking, holding, that, the, conglomerates, were, indeed, in, violation, of, antitrust, the, justices, refrained, from, making, a, final, decision, as, to, how, that, fault, should, be, remedied, but, the, case, was, sent, back, to, the, lower, court, from, which, it, had, come, with, language, that, suggested, divorcement, the, complete, separation, of, exhibition, interests, from, producer, distributor, operations, was, the, answer, the, big, five, though, seemed, united, in, their, determination, to, fight, on, and, drag, out, legal, proceedings, for, years, as, they, had, already, proven, adept, at, after, all, the, paramount, suit, had, originally, been, filed, on, july, 20, 1938, however, behind, the, scenes, at, rko, long, the, financially, shakiest, of, the, conglomerates, the, court, ruling, came, to, be, looked, at, as, a, development, that, could, be, used, to, the, studio, s, advantage, the, same, month, that, the, decision, was, handed, down, multimillionaire, howard, hughes, acquired, a, controlling, interest, in, the, company, as, rko, controlled, the, fewest, theaters, of, any, of, the, big, five, hughes, decided, that, starting, a, divorcement, domino, effect, could, actually, help, put, his, studio, on, a, more, equal, footing, with, his, competitors, hughes, signaled, his, willingness, to, the, federal, government, to, enter, into, a, consent, decree, obliging, the, breakup, of, his, movie, business, under, the, agreement, hughes, would, split, his, studio, into, two, entities, rko, pictures, corporation, and, rko, theatres, corporation, and, commit, to, selling, off, his, stake, in, one, or, the, other, by, a, certain, date, hughes, s, decision, to, concede, to, divorcement, terminally, undermined, the, argument, by, lawyers, for, the, rest, of, the, big, five, that, such, breakups, were, unfeasible, while, many, today, point, to, the, may, court, ruling, it, is, actually, hughes, s, agreement, with, the, federal, government, signed, november, 8, 1948, that, was, truly, the, death, knell, for, the, golden, age, of, hollywood, paramount, soon, capitulated, entering, into, a, similar, consent, decree, the, following, february, the, studio, which, had, fought, against, divorcement, for, so, long, became, the, first, of, the, majors, to, break, up, ahead, of, schedule, finalizing, divestiture, on, december, 31, 1949, by, this, time, there, were, 19, 000, movie, theaters, in, the, united, states, through, hughes, s, deal, with, the, federal, authorities, and, those, by, the, other, studios, that, soon, followed, the, studio, system, lingered, on, for, another, half, decade, the, major, studio, that, adapted, to, the, new, circumstances, with, the, most, immediate, success, was, the, smallest, united, artists, under, a, new, management, team, that, took, over, in, 1951, overhead, was, cut, by, terminating, its, lease, arrangement, with, the, pickford, fairbanks, production, facility, and, new, relationships, with, independent, producers, now, often, involving, direct, investment, were, forged, a, business, model, that, hollywood, would, increasingly, emulate, in, coming, years, the, studio, system, around, which, the, industry, had, been, organized, for, three, decades, finally, expired, in, 1954, when, loew, s, the, last, holdout, severed, all, operational, ties, with, mgm, hughes, s, gambit, helped, break, the, studio, system, but, it, did, little, for, rko, his, disruptive, leadership, coupled, with, the, draining, away, of, audiences, to, television, that, was, affecting, the, entire, industry, took, a, toll, on, the, studio, that, was, evident, to, hollywood, observers, when, hughes, sought, to, bail, out, of, his, rko, interest, in, 1952, he, had, to, turn, to, a, chicago, based, syndicate, led, by, shady, dealers, without, motion, picture, experience, the, deal, fell, through, so, hughes, was, back, in, charge, when, the, rko, theater, chain, was, finally, sold, off, as, mandated, in, 1953, that, year, general, tire, and, rubber, company, which, was, expanding, its, small, decade, old, broadcasting, division, approached, hughes, concerning, the, availability, of, rko, s, film, library, for, programming, hughes, acquired, near, complete, ownership, of, rko, pictures, in, december, 1954, and, consummated, a, sale, with, general, tire, for, the, entire, studio, the, following, summer, the, new, owners, quickly, made, some, of, their, money, back, by, selling, the, tv, rights, for, the, library, they, treasured, to, c, c, television, corp, a, beverage, company, subsidiary, rko, retained, the, rights, for, the, few, tv, stations, general, tire, had, brought, along, under, the, deal, the, films, were, stripped, of, their, rko, identity, before, being, sent, by, c, c, to, local, stations, the, famous, opening, logo, with, its, globe, and, radio, tower, was, removed, as, were, the, studio, s, other, trademarks, back, in, hollywood, rko, s, new, owners, were, encountering, little, success, in, the, moviemaking, business, and, by, 1957, general, tire, shut, down, production, and, sold, the, main, rko, facilities, to, desilu, the, production, company, of, lucille, ball, and, desi, arnaz, just, like, united, artists, the, studio, now, no, longer, had, a, studio, unlike, ua, it, barely, owned, its, old, movies, and, saw, no, profit, in, the, making, of, new, ones, in, 1959, it, abandoned, the, movie, business, entirely, while, the, studio, system, is, largely, identified, as, an, american, phenomenon, film, production, companies, in, other, countries, did, at, times, achieve, and, maintain, full, integration, in, a, manner, similar, to, hollywood, s, big, five, as, historian, james, chapman, describes, in, britain, only, two, companies, ever, achieved, full, vertical, integration, the, rank, organization, and, the, associated, british, picture, corporation, other, countries, where, some, level, of, vertical, integration, occurred, were, germany, during, the, 1920s, universum, film, aktiengesellschaft, or, ufa, france, during, the, 1930s, gaumont, franco, film, aubert, and, path, natan, and, japan, nikkatsu, shochiku, and, toho, in, hong, kong, shaw, brothers, adopted, the, studio, system, for, its, wuxia, films, throughout, the, 1950s, 60s, india, which, represents, perhaps, the, only, serious, rival, to, the, u, s, film, industry, due, to, its, dominance, of, both, its, own, and, the, asian, diasporic, markets, has, in, contrast, never, achieved, any, degree, of, vertical, integration, for, instance, in, 1929, nearly, 75, percent, of, japanese, movie, theaters, were, connected, with, either, nikkatsu, or, shochiku, the, two, biggest, studios, at, the, time, we, find, ourselves, dealing, with, corporations, rather, than, with, individuals, in, the, 1950s, hollywood, faced, three, great, challenges, the, paramount, case, ending, the, studio, system, the, new, popularity, of, television, and, consumer, spending, providing, its, audience, with, many, other, leisure, options, the, scale, of, both, box, office, successes, and, flops, grew, with, a, dangerous, middle, consisting, of, films, that, in, the, previous, era, would, have, made, money, a, filmmaker, stated, in, 1957, that, he, one, absolute, disaster, today, is, to, make, a, million, dollar, mediocrity, one, of, these, you, can, lose, not, only, your, total, investment, but, your, total, shirt, by, that, year, hollywood, was, only, making, about, 300, feature, films, a, year, compared, to, about, 700, during, the, 1920s, darryl, f, zanuck, head, of, 20th, century, fox, had, no, direct, involvement, with, the, studio, from, 1956, to, 1962, and, louis, b, mayer, sacked, in, 1951, from, mgm, died, in, 1957, harry, cohn, of, columbia, who, died, the, following, year, informed, investors, in, the, studio, s, annual, report, of, 1957, that, we, find, ourselves, in, a, highly, competitive, market, for, these, talents, under, today, s, tax, structures, salary, to, those, we, are, dealing, with, is, less, inviting, than, the, opportunity, for, capital, gains, we, find, ourselves, therefore, dealing, with, corporations, rather, than, with, individuals, we, find, ourselves, too, forced, to, deal, in, terms, of, a, percentage, of, the, film, s, profits, rather, than, in, a, guaranteed, salary, as, in, the, past, this, is, most, notable, among, the, top, stars, most, actors, became, freelancers, after, the, end, of, the, studio, system, financial, backers, increasingly, demanded, star, actors, directors, and, writers, for, projects, to, reduce, risk, of, failure, the, growing, importance, of, the, overseas, market, 40, to, 50, of, hollywood, s, total, revenue, by, 1957, also, emphasized, stars, names, as, box, office, attractions, with, their, new, power, working, for, nothing, receiving, a, percentage, of, profit, instead, of, a, salary, became, a, status, symbol, for, stars, a, top, actor, could, expect, 50, of, profit, with, a, minimum, guarantee, or, 10, of, gross, revenue, cary, grant, for, example, received, more, than, 700, 000, equivalent, to, 6, 2, million, in, 2023, from, his, 10, of, the, gross, for, to, catch, a, thief, 1955, while, director, and, producer, alfred, hitchcock, received, less, than, 50, 000, in, one, extreme, case, paramount, promised, marlon, brando, 75, of, the, profit, of, what, became, one, eyed, jacks, 1961, because, of, hollywood, accounting, studios, still, received, much, of, the, revenue, before, any, profit, sharing, thus, they, preferred, 50, of, profit, to, 10, of, gross, the, larger, paychecks, also, increased, the, power, of, talent, agents, such, as, lew, wasserman, of, mca, whose, office, was, now, nicknamed, fort, knox, by, 1957, independent, producers, made, 50, of, full, length, american, films, beyond, working, for, others, top, actors, such, as, gregory, peck, and, frank, sinatra, created, their, own, production, companies, and, purchased, scripts, top, independent, directors, george, stevens, billy, wilder, and, william, wyler, also, saw, their, paychecks, increase, in, part, because, their, involvement, attracted, star, actors, studios, increasingly, provided, funding, and, facilities, to, independent, producers, as, opposed, to, making, their, own, films, or, just, like, united, artists, they, focused, on, distribution, while, television, had, damaged, hollywood, tv, production, companies, such, as, desilu, and, the, film, studios, own, tv, divisions, helped, save, the, industry, by, using, otherwise, unused, facilities, at, the, beginning, of, the, 1960s, the, major, studios, began, to, reissue, older, films, for, syndication, and, transformed, into, mainly, producing, telefilms, and, b, movies, to, supply, tv, s, demand, for, programming, 17, the, industry, underwent, a, severe, recession, due, in, part, to, big, budget, flops, but, soon, recovered, artistically, with, such, films, as, the, godfather, 1972, and, chinatown, 1974, steven, spielberg, s, 1975, jaws, and, george, lucas, s, star, wars, 1977, became, the, prototype, for, the, modern, blockbuster, 19, prior, to, jaws, most, films, would, initially, be, released, in, a, few, key, cities, and, would, later, spread, to, secondary, markets, across, the, country, based, on, the, response, in, those, markets, a, system, called, platforming, jaws, was, instead, immediately, released, simultaneously, across, the, country, and, backed, by, a, 700, 000, tv, advertising, budget, the, first, time, that, trailers, were, released, on, network, television, along, with, extensive, promotional, merchandising, the, release, of, films, at, hundreds, of, venues, became, the, norm, with, hits, such, as, the, sequels, to, lucas, s, star, wars, the, empire, strikes, back, and, return, of, the, jedi, spielberg, s, back, to, back, successes, with, raiders, of, the, lost, ark, and, e, t, the, extra, terrestrial, and, the, development, of, home, video, and, cable, television, meanwhile, the, uncontrolled, budget, of, heaven, s, gate, 1980, and, its, limited, box, office, revenue, led, to, the, sale, of, united, artists, from, 1990, to, 1995, new, hollywood, turned, into, more, of, a, conglomerate, hollywood, and, quickly, dominating, the, entire, global, entertainment, industry, 25, 26, today, three, of, the, golden, age, majors, universal, paramount, and, warner, bros, along, with, sony, pictures, formed, by, a, merger, between, columbia, and, tristar, continue, to, exist, as, major, hollywood, studio, entities, all, of, which, were, taken, over, by, many, different, companies, that, were, acquired, by, and, merged, with, larger, media, conglomerates, furthermore, to, date, the, walt, disney, studios, has, emerged, as, a, major, resulting, in, a, big, six, until, its, acquisition, of, 20th, century, fox, in, early, 2019, resulted, in, a, big, five, once, again, with, the, exception, of, disney, all, the, other, four, of, today, s, big, five, major, studios, paramount, sony, pictures, universal, and, warner, bros, are, essentially, based, on, the, model, not, of, the, classic, big, five, at, that, time, paramount, and, warner, bros, in, addition, to, 20th, century, fox, mgm, and, rko, but, of, the, old, united, artists, that, is, they, are, primarily, backer, distributors, and, physical, studio, leasers, rather, than, actual, production, companies, in, 1996, time, warner, acquired, the, once, independent, new, line, cinema, via, its, purchase, of, turner, broadcasting, system, in, 2008, new, line, was, merged, into, warner, bros, where, it, continues, to, exist, as, a, subsidiary, each, of, today, s, big, five, controls, quasi, independent, arthouse, divisions, such, as, paramount, vantage, miramax, films, which, originally, was, an, independent, studio, was, owned, by, disney, until, 2010, most, also, have, divisions, that, focus, on, genre, movies, b, movies, either, literally, by, virtue, of, their, low, budgets, or, spiritually, for, instance, sony, s, screen, gems, one, so, called, indie, division, universal, s, focus, features, releases, arthouse, films, under, that, primary, brand, both, focus, and, disney, s, arthouse, division, searchlight, pictures, are, large, enough, to, qualify, as, mini, majors, two, large, independent, firms, also, qualify, as, mini, majors, lionsgate, and, the, aforementioned, mgm, acquired, by, amazon, in, 2022, they, stand, somewhere, between, latter, day, versions, of, the, old, major, minor, just, like, columbia, and, universal, were, in, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, except, lionsgate, has, about, half, their, market, share, and, leading, golden, age, independent, production, outfits, such, as, samuel, goldwyn, inc, and, the, companies, of, david, o, selznick, in, the, mid, 2010s, major, studios, shifted, towards, producing, mainstream, films, that, appeal, to, the, audience, genre, films, sequels, 3, d, and, superhero, films, many, of, these, films, risk, losing, money, at, the, box, office, and, some, in, fact, have, this, in, part, precipitated, the, second, decline, as, audiences, began, to, turn, away, from, movie, theatres, with, this, new, decline, an, opportunity, opened, up, for, independent, companies, to, produce, films, have, upset, major, studio, films, for, the, academy, award, for, best, picture, the, academy, of, motion, picture, arts, and, sciences, which, produces, the, annual, academy, awards, typically, award, best, picture, oscars, to, films, of, artistic, and, scientific, merit, rather, than, the, franchise, films, in, recent, years, the, multiple, award, wins, for, independent, films, such, as, spotlight, open, road, 2015, moonlight, a24, 2016, parasite, cj, neon, 2019, and, coda, apple, tv, 2021, has, had, a, notable, impact, on, box, office, revenue, of, other, major, studio, films, the, continuing, praise, of, the, independent, film, implies, success, is, not, dependent, on, a, film, s, format, whether, it, be, 3, d, a, streaming, exclusive, or, large, format, such, as, imax, contemporary, outcomes, of, the, cannes, film, festival, and, the, lack, of, american, films, winning, these, awards, may, also, have, affected, the, dominance, of, independent, film, the, covid, 19, crisis, contributed, to, a, further, decline, as, audiences, began, switching, from, movie, theatres, to, streaming, services, such, as, netflix, hulu, and, apple, tv
