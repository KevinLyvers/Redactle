the, venus, de, milo, or, aphrodite, of, melos, is, an, ancient, greek, marble, sculpture, that, was, created, during, the, hellenistic, period, its, exact, dating, is, uncertain, but, the, modern, consensus, places, it, in, the, 2nd, century, bc, perhaps, between, 160, and, 110, bc, it, was, rediscovered, in, 1820, on, the, island, of, milos, greece, and, has, been, displayed, at, the, louvre, museum, since, 1821, since, the, statue, s, discovery, it, has, become, one, of, the, most, famous, works, of, ancient, greek, sculpture, in, the, world, the, venus, de, milo, is, believed, to, depict, aphrodite, the, greek, goddess, of, love, whose, roman, counterpart, was, venus, made, of, parian, marble, the, statue, is, larger, than, life, size, standing, over, 2, metres, 6, ft, 7, in, high, the, statue, is, missing, both, arms, the, original, position, of, these, missing, arms, is, uncertain, the, sculpture, was, originally, identified, as, depicting, aphrodite, holding, the, apple, of, discord, as, a, marble, hand, holding, an, apple, was, found, alongside, it, recent, scientific, analysis, supports, the, identification, of, this, hand, as, part, of, the, sculpture, on, the, basis, of, a, now, lost, inscription, found, near, the, sculpture, it, has, been, attributed, to, alexandros, from, antioch, on, the, maeander, though, the, name, on, the, inscription, is, uncertain, and, its, connection, to, the, venus, is, disputed, the, venus, de, milo, rapidly, became, a, cornerstone, of, the, louvre, s, antiquities, collection, in, the, aftermath, of, the, napoleonic, wars, and, its, fame, spread, through, distribution, in, photographs, and, three, dimensional, copies, the, statue, inspired, over, 70, poems, influenced, 19th, century, art, and, the, surrealist, movement, in, the, early, 20th, century, and, has, been, featured, in, various, modern, artistic, projects, including, film, and, advertising, in, contrast, to, the, popular, appreciation, of, the, sculpture, scholars, have, been, more, critical, though, upon, its, discovery, the, venus, was, considered, a, classical, masterpiece, since, it, was, re, dated, to, the, hellenistic, period, classicists, have, neglected, the, venus, in, favour, of, studying, sculptures, mentioned, in, ancient, written, sources, even, though, they, only, survive, as, later, copies, which, are, technically, inferior, to, the, venus, the, venus, de, milo, is, an, over, 2, metres, 6, ft, 7, in, tall, parian, marble, statue, of, a, greek, goddess, most, likely, aphrodite, depicted, with, a, bare, torso, and, drapery, over, the, lower, half, of, her, body, the, figure, stands, with, her, weight, on, her, right, leg, and, the, left, leg, raised, her, head, is, turned, to, the, left, the, statue, is, missing, both, arms, the, left, foot, and, the, earlobes, there, is, a, filled, hole, below, her, right, breast, that, originally, contained, a, metal, tenon, that, would, have, supported, the, right, arm, the, venus, flesh, is, polished, smooth, but, chisel, marks, are, still, visible, on, other, surfaces, the, drapery, is, more, elaborately, carved, on, the, right, hand, side, of, the, statue, than, the, left, perhaps, because, on, the, left, hand, side, it, was, originally, obscured, from, view, likewise, the, venus, is, less, finely, finished, from, behind, suggesting, that, it, was, originally, intended, to, be, viewed, only, from, the, front, while, the, body, of, the, venus, is, depicted, in, a, realistic, style, the, head, is, more, idealised, the, lips, are, slightly, open, the, eyes, and, mouth, are, small, the, sculpture, has, been, minimally, restored, only, the, tip, of, the, nose, lower, lip, big, toe, on, the, right, foot, and, some, of, the, drapery, stylistically, the, sculpture, combines, elements, of, classical, and, hellenistic, art, features, such, as, the, small, regular, eyes, and, mouth, and, the, strong, brow, and, nose, are, classical, in, style, while, the, shape, of, the, torso, and, the, deeply, carved, drapery, are, hellenistic, kenneth, clark, describes, the, figure, as, the, last, great, work, of, antique, greece, and, of, all, the, works, of, antiquity, one, of, the, most, complex, and, the, most, artful, has, consciously, attempted, to, give, the, effect, of, a, 5th, century, work, while, also, using, the, inventions, of, his, own, time, the, planes, of, her, body, are, so, large, and, calm, that, at, first, we, do, not, realise, the, number, of, angles, through, which, they, pass, in, architectural, terms, she, is, a, baroque, composition, with, classic, effect, the, venus, de, milo, was, discovered, on, 8, april, 1820, by, a, greek, farmer, on, the, island, of, milos, then, still, part, of, the, ottoman, empire, olivier, voutier, a, french, sailor, interested, in, archaeology, witnessed, the, discovery, and, encouraged, the, farmer, to, continue, digging, voutier, and, the, farmer, uncovered, two, large, pieces, of, the, sculpture, and, a, third, smaller, piece, a, fragment, of, an, arm, a, hand, holding, an, apple, and, two, herms, were, also, found, alongside, the, statue, two, inscriptions, were, also, apparently, found, with, the, venus, one, transcribed, by, dumont, d, urville, a, french, naval, officer, who, arrived, on, milos, shortly, after, the, discovery, commemorates, a, dedication, by, one, bakchios, son, of, satios, the, assistant, gymnasiarch, the, other, recorded, on, a, drawing, made, by, auguste, debay, preserves, part, of, a, sculptor, s, signature, both, inscriptions, are, now, lost, other, sculptural, fragments, found, around, the, same, time, include, a, third, herm, two, further, arms, and, a, foot, with, sandal, dumont, d, urville, wrote, an, account, of, the, find, according, to, his, testimony, the, venus, statue, was, found, in, a, quadrangular, niche, if, this, findspot, were, the, original, context, for, the, venus, the, niche, and, the, gymnasiarch, s, inscription, suggests, that, the, venus, de, milo, was, installed, in, the, gymnasium, of, melos, an, alternative, theory, proposed, by, salomon, reinach, is, that, the, findspot, was, instead, the, remains, of, a, lime, kiln, and, that, the, other, fragments, had, no, connection, to, the, venus, this, theory, is, dismissed, by, christofilis, maggidis, as, having, no, factual, basis, after, stopping, in, melos, d, urville, s, ship, sailed, to, constantinople, where, he, reported, the, find, to, the, comte, de, marcellus, assistant, to, charles, fran, ois, de, riffardeau, marquis, de, rivi, re, the, french, ambassador, rivi, re, agreed, that, marcellus, should, go, to, melos, to, buy, the, statue, by, the, time, marcellus, arrived, at, melos, the, farmer, who, discovered, the, statue, had, already, received, another, offer, to, buy, it, and, it, had, been, loaded, onto, a, ship, the, french, intervened, and, marcellus, was, able, to, buy, the, venus, it, was, brought, to, france, where, louis, xviii, had, it, installed, in, the, louvre, contrary, to, the, usual, practice, at, the, time, on, the, recommendation, of, quatrem, re, de, quincy, the, venus, was, not, significantly, restored, but, was, exhibited, in, the, state, in, which, she, was, discovered, quatrem, re, who, believed, that, the, venus, was, originally, part, of, a, group, with, a, sculpture, of, mars, argued, that, as, the, entire, mars, was, missing, it, was, impossible, to, restore, the, sculpture, the, venus, de, milo, was, initially, installed, in, the, louvre, in, 1821, it, was, rapidly, moved, twice, before, finding, a, long, term, home, in, the, salle, du, tibre, where, it, remained, until, 1848, from, there, it, was, moved, to, the, salle, de, l, isis, where, it, remained, until, being, removed, from, the, museum, in, 1870, for, protection, during, the, paris, commune, when, the, salle, de, l, isis, was, renovated, in, the, 1880s, the, venus, was, given, a, new, pedestal, which, allowed, spectators, to, rotate, the, sculpture, at, the, same, time, the, approach, to, the, sculpture, was, filled, with, other, ancient, venus, statues, a, proposal, in, 1919, to, display, the, venus, alongside, the, leonardo, s, mona, lisa, and, michelangelo, s, dying, slave, and, rebellious, slave, was, never, carried, out, but, in, 1936, the, sculpture, was, once, again, moved, to, the, salle, de, la, v, nus, de, milo, to, accommodate, the, volume, of, visitors, to, the, louvre, the, other, venus, statues, were, removed, to, focus, visitors, on, the, venus, de, milo, at, this, time, the, route, for, visitors, through, the, louvre, was, modified, to, be, more, chronological, coming, through, galleries, of, archaic, and, classical, sculpture, before, arriving, in, a, gallery, dedicated, to, the, hellenstic, period, the, venus, de, milo, was, placed, between, the, classical, and, hellenistic, galleries, during, the, second, world, war, the, sculpture, was, once, again, removed, from, the, louvre, for, safekeeping, and, stored, in, the, ch, teau, de, valen, ay, in, 1964, it, was, exhibited, in, tokyo, and, kyoto, this, is, the, only, time, the, sculpture, has, left, france, since, it, was, acquired, by, the, louvre, in, 1972, an, experiment, was, made, with, a, new, site, for, the, sculpture, and, it, was, temporarily, moved, to, allow, renovations, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, by, 1999, the, volume, of, visitors, to, the, venus, was, causing, problems, and, the, louvre, authorities, were, considering, returning, the, sculpture, to, its, previous, setting, in, 2010, the, sculpture, was, installed, in, its, new, setting, with, the, sculptural, fragments, discovered, alongside, it, on, display, in, the, same, room, the, venus, de, milo, is, probably, a, sculpture, of, the, goddess, aphrodite, but, its, fragmentary, state, makes, secure, identification, difficult, the, earliest, written, accounts, of, the, sculpture, by, a, french, captain, and, the, french, vice, consul, on, melos, both, identify, it, as, representing, aphrodite, holding, the, apple, of, discord, apparently, on, the, basis, of, the, now, lost, hand, holding, an, apple, found, with, the, sculpture, an, alternative, identification, proposed, by, reinach, is, that, she, represents, the, sea, goddess, amphitrite, and, was, originally, grouped, with, a, sculpture, of, poseidon, from, melos, discovered, in, 1878, other, proposed, identifications, include, a, muse, nemesis, or, sappho, the, authorship, and, date, of, the, venus, de, milo, were, both, disputed, from, its, discovery, within, a, month, of, its, acquisition, by, the, louvre, three, french, scholars, had, published, papers, on, the, statue, disagreeing, on, all, aspects, of, its, interpretation, toussaint, bernard, m, ric, david, thought, it, dated, to, c, 420, bc, c, 380, bc, between, sculptors, phidias, and, praxiteles, quatrem, re, de, quincy, attributed, it, to, the, mid, fourth, century, and, the, circle, of, praxiteles, and, the, comte, de, clarac, thought, it, a, later, copy, of, a, work, by, praxiteles, the, scholarly, consensus, in, the, 19th, century, was, that, the, venus, dated, to, the, fourth, century, bc, in, 1893, adolf, furtw, ngler, was, the, first, to, argue, that, it, was, in, fact, late, hellenistic, dating, to, c, 150, bc, c, 50, bc, and, this, dating, continues, to, be, widely, accepted, one, of, the, inscriptions, discovered, with, the, statue, which, was, drawn, by, debay, as, fitting, into, the, missing, section, of, the, statue, s, plinth, names, the, sculptor, as, andros, son, of, enides, of, antioch, on, the, maeander, the, inscription, must, date, to, after, 280, bc, when, antioch, on, the, maeander, was, founded, the, lettering, of, the, inscription, suggests, a, date, of, 150, 50, bc, maggidis, argues, based, on, this, inscription, as, well, as, the, style, of, the, statue, and, the, increasing, prosperity, of, melos, in, the, period, due, to, roman, involvement, on, the, island, which, he, suggests, is, a, plausible, context, for, the, commissioning, of, the, sculpture, that, it, probably, dates, to, c, 150, bc, c, 110, bc, rachel, kousser, agrees, with, furtw, ngler, s, dates, for, the, sculpture, marianne, hamiaux, suggests, c, 160, bc, c, 140, bc, the, association, of, the, fragmentary, artist, s, signature, with, the, sculpture, and, thus, the, identification, of, the, sculptor, as, alexandros, of, antioch, is, not, universally, accepted, kousser, and, jean, luc, martinez, both, question, this, connection, kousser, notes, that, though, the, plaque, is, shown, fitting, into, the, broken, base, of, the, venus, in, debay, s, drawing, the, drawing, shows, no, evidence, of, the, sculpture, s, missing, left, foot, which, would, have, rested, on, it, while, in, voutier, s, sketch, of, the, finds, the, plaque, is, shown, as, the, base, of, one, of, the, herms, found, alongside, the, venus, as, the, inscription, is, lost, its, connection, to, the, venus, cannot, be, either, proven, or, disproven, magiddis, suggested, that, the, venus, de, milo, was, carved, by, the, same, sculptor, who, also, made, the, poseidon, of, melos, ism, ni, trianti, has, suggested, that, three, further, sculptures, found, in, melos, can, be, attributed, to, the, same, artist, two, statues, of, women, and, a, colossal, statue, of, a, god, without, arms, it, is, unclear, what, the, statue, originally, looked, like, the, original, appearance, of, the, venus, has, been, disputed, since, 1821, with, de, clarac, arguing, that, the, venus, was, a, single, figure, holding, an, apple, whereas, quatremere, held, that, she, was, part, of, a, group, with, her, arms, around, another, figure, other, proposed, restorations, have, included, the, venus, holding, wreaths, a, dove, or, spears, wilhelm, fr, hner, suggested, in, 1876, that, the, venus, de, milo, s, right, hand, held, the, drapery, slipping, down, from, her, hips, while, the, left, held, an, apple, this, theory, was, expanded, on, by, furtw, ngler, kousser, considers, this, the, most, plausible, reconstruction, scientific, analyses, conducted, during, restoration, of, the, venus, in, 2010, supported, the, theory, that, the, arm, fragment, and, hand, holding, the, apple, found, alongside, the, sculpture, were, originally, part, of, the, venus, martinez, argues, that, the, identification, of, the, sculpture, as, venus, holding, an, apple, is, thus, definitively, proved, hamiaux, suggests, that, the, venus, de, milo, is, of, the, same, sculptural, type, as, the, capuan, venus, and, another, sculpture, of, aphrodite, from, perge, she, argues, that, all, derive, from, the, cult, statue, in, the, temple, of, aphrodite, on, the, acrocorinth, which, depicted, aphrodite, admiring, herself, in, a, shield, christine, mitchell, havelock, who, believes, the, capuan, venus, was, based, on, the, venus, de, milo, by, contrast, considers, the, melian, sculpture, a, fresh, invention, of, the, hellenistic, period, no, ancient, source, can, be, securely, identified, as, discussing, the, venus, de, milo, and, there, are, neither, enough, surviving, ancient, statues, nor, enough, evidence, about, how, ancient, greeks, judged, artistic, quality, to, judge, how, the, sculpture, would, have, been, received, in, the, ancient, world, but, according, to, kenneth, clark, in, 1949, within, a, few, years, of, her, discovery, in, 1820, the, venus, de, milo, had, taken, the, central, impregnable, position, formerly, occupied, by, the, venus, de, medici, and, even, now, that, she, has, lost, favour, with, connoisseurs, and, archaeologists, she, has, held, her, place, in, popular, imagery, as, a, symbol, or, trade, mark, of, beauty, today, the, venus, de, milo, is, perhaps, the, most, famous, ancient, greek, statue, in, the, world, seen, by, more, than, seven, million, visitors, every, year, it, established, itself, as, a, key, part, of, the, louvre, s, antiquities, collection, soon, after, its, discovery, at, this, time, the, louvre, had, recently, lost, several, major, works, following, the, napoleonic, wars, as, objects, acquired, by, napoleon, were, returned, to, their, countries, of, origin, the, venus, was, soon, one, of, the, most, famous, antiquities, in, europe, in, the, 19th, century, it, was, distributed, in, plaster, casts, photographs, and, bronze, copies, a, plaster, cast, was, sent, to, the, berlin, academy, in, 1822, only, a, year, after, the, louvre, acquired, the, venus, and, a, cast, was, displayed, at, the, crystal, palace, the, venus, de, milo, has, been, the, subject, of, both, literature, and, the, visual, arts, since, its, discovery, more, than, 70, poems, about, the, venus, have, been, published, in, the, 19th, century, paintings, of, the, venus, often, depicted, statuettes, of, the, figure, for, instance, in, honor, daumier, s, the, connoisseur, 19th, century, artists, also, used, the, venus, as, a, model, max, klinger, based, the, minerva, in, his, judgement, of, paris, on, the, venus, de, milo, eugene, delacroix, may, have, used, it, for, liberty, leading, the, people, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, venus, de, milo, caught, the, attention, of, the, surrealist, movement, erwin, blumenfeld, and, clarence, sinclair, bull, both, made, photomontages, based, on, the, venus, max, ernst, used, the, venus, in, his, instruction, manuals, ren, magritte, painted, a, plaster, copy, of, the, venus, making, her, body, pink, her, robe, blue, and, leaving, the, head, white, and, salvador, dal, based, several, paintings, and, sculptures, including, his, painting, the, hallucinogenic, toreador, on, her, in, contemporary, art, niki, de, saint, phalle, has, used, a, reproduction, of, the, venus, in, a, performance, yves, klein, produced, a, copy, in, international, klein, blue, and, artists, including, arman, clive, barker, and, jim, dine, have, all, made, sculptures, inspired, by, the, venus, the, iconic, status, of, the, venus, de, milo, has, meant, that, in, the, 20th, century, it, has, been, used, in, film, and, advertising, a, poster, for, the, 1932, film, blonde, venus, shows, marlene, dietrich, as, the, venus, de, milo, while, in, 2003, eva, green, wearing, only, a, white, sheet, and, black, arm, length, gloves, recreated, the, sculpture, in, the, dreamers, actresses, have, frequently, been, compared, to, the, venus, an, article, in, photoplay, in, 1928, concluded, the, joan, crawford, was, the, hollywood, actress, whose, measurements, most, resembled, the, venus, de, milo, clara, bow, and, jean, harlow, were, both, photographed, as, the, venus, for, magazines, advertisements, for, kellogg, s, cornflakes, an, early, speakerphone, made, by, general, telephone, electronics, levi, s, jeans, and, mercedes, benz, cars, have, all, used, the, venus, in, contrast, with, the, popular, and, artistic, appreciation, of, the, venus, since, f, rtwangler, re, dated, the, sculpture, to, the, hellenistic, period, some, scholars, have, been, more, critical, in, his, history, of, greek, art, martin, robertson, argues, that, the, sculpture, s, reputation, is, due, more, to, propaganda, than, to, its, own, artistic, merit, scholars, have, concentrated, on, studying, copies, of, classical, sculpture, mentioned, in, ancient, sources, such, as, the, aphrodite, of, knidos, than, the, venus, de, milo, even, when, those, copies, are, generally, considered, to, be, technically, inferior, to, the, venus, elizabeth, prettejohn, argues, that, this, is, due, to, classicists, bias, towards, written, sources, over, visual, ones
