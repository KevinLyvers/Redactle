describe, how, everyone, occupies, an, immense, range, in, time, la, recherche, made, a, decisive, break, with, the, 19th, century, realist, and, plot, driven, novel, populated, by, people, of, action, and, people, representing, social, and, cultural, groups, or, morals, although, parts, of, the, novel, could, be, read, as, an, exploration, of, snobbery, deceit, jealousy, and, suffering, and, although, it, contains, a, multitude, of, realistic, details, the, focus, is, not, on, the, development, of, a, tight, plot, or, of, a, coherent, evolution, but, on, a, multiplicity, of, perspectives, and, on, the, formation, of, experience, the, protagonists, of, the, first, volume, the, narrator, as, a, boy, and, swann, are, by, the, standards, of, 19th, century, novels, remarkably, introspective, and, passive, nor, do, they, trigger, action, from, other, leading, characters, to, contemporary, readers, reared, on, honor, de, balzac, victor, hugo, and, leo, tolstoy, they, would, not, function, as, centers, of, a, plot, while, there, is, an, array, of, symbolism, in, the, work, it, is, rarely, defined, through, explicit, keys, leading, to, moral, romantic, or, philosophical, ideas, the, significance, of, what, is, happening, is, often, placed, within, the, memory, or, into, the, inner, contemplation, of, what, is, described, this, focus, on, the, relationship, between, experience, memory, and, writing, and, the, radical, de, emphasizing, of, the, outward, plot, have, become, staples, of, the, modern, novel, but, were, almost, unheard, of, in, 1913, roger, shattuck, elucidates, an, underlying, principle, in, understanding, proust, and, the, various, themes, present, in, his, novel, thus, the, novel, embodies, and, manifests, the, principle, of, intermittence, to, live, means, to, perceive, different, and, often, conflicting, aspects, of, reality, this, iridescence, never, resolves, itself, completely, into, a, unitive, point, of, view, accordingly, it, is, possible, to, project, out, of, the, search, itself, a, series, of, putative, and, intermittent, authors, the, portraitist, of, an, expiring, society, the, artist, of, romantic, reminiscence, the, narrator, of, the, laminated, i, the, classicist, of, formal, structure, all, these, figures, are, to, be, found, in, proust, the, role, of, memory, is, central, to, the, novel, introduced, with, the, famous, madeleine, episode, in, the, first, section, of, the, novel, and, in, the, last, volume, time, regained, a, flashback, similar, to, that, caused, by, the, madeleine, is, the, beginning, of, the, resolution, of, the, story, throughout, the, work, many, similar, instances, of, involuntary, memory, triggered, by, sensory, experiences, such, as, sights, sounds, and, smells, conjure, important, memories, for, the, narrator, and, sometimes, return, attention, to, an, earlier, episode, of, the, novel, although, proust, wrote, contemporaneously, with, sigmund, freud, with, there, being, many, points, of, similarity, between, their, thought, on, the, structures, and, mechanisms, of, the, human, mind, neither, author, read, the, other, the, madeleine, episode, reads, no, sooner, had, the, warm, liquid, mixed, with, the, crumbs, touched, my, palate, than, a, shudder, ran, through, me, and, i, stopped, intent, upon, the, extraordinary, thing, that, was, happening, to, me, an, exquisite, pleasure, had, invaded, my, senses, something, isolated, detached, with, no, suggestion, of, its, origin, and, at, once, the, vicissitudes, of, life, had, become, indifferent, to, me, its, disasters, innocuous, its, brevity, illusory, this, new, sensation, having, had, on, me, the, effect, which, love, has, of, filling, me, with, a, precious, essence, or, rather, this, essence, was, not, in, me, it, was, me, whence, did, it, come, what, did, it, mean, how, could, i, seize, and, apprehend, it, and, suddenly, the, memory, revealed, itself, the, taste, was, that, of, the, little, piece, of, madeleine, which, on, sunday, mornings, at, combray, because, on, those, mornings, i, did, not, go, out, before, mass, when, i, went, to, say, good, morning, to, her, in, her, bedroom, my, aunt, l, onie, used, to, give, me, dipping, it, first, in, her, own, cup, of, tea, or, tisane, the, sight, of, the, little, madeleine, had, recalled, nothing, to, my, mind, before, i, tasted, it, and, all, from, my, cup, of, tea, gilles, deleuze, believed, that, the, focus, of, proust, was, not, memory, and, the, past, but, the, narrator, s, learning, the, use, of, signs, to, understand, and, communicate, ultimate, reality, thereby, becoming, an, artist, while, proust, was, bitterly, aware, of, the, experience, of, loss, and, exclusion, loss, of, loved, ones, loss, of, affection, friendship, and, innocent, joy, which, are, dramatized, in, the, novel, through, recurrent, jealousy, betrayal, and, the, death, of, loved, ones, his, response, to, this, formulated, after, he, had, discovered, ruskin, was, that, the, work, of, art, can, recapture, the, lost, and, thus, save, it, from, destruction, at, least, in, our, minds, art, triumphs, over, the, destructive, power, of, time, this, element, of, his, artistic, thought, is, clearly, inherited, from, romantic, platonism, but, proust, crosses, it, with, a, new, intensity, in, describing, jealousy, desire, and, self, doubt, note, the, last, quatrain, of, baudelaire, s, poem, une, charogne, then, o, my, beauty, say, to, the, worms, who, will, devour, you, with, kisses, that, i, have, kept, the, form, and, the, divine, essence, of, my, decomposed, love, proust, begins, his, novel, with, the, statement, for, a, long, time, i, used, to, go, to, bed, early, this, leads, to, lengthy, discussion, of, his, anxiety, at, leaving, his, mother, at, night, and, his, attempts, to, force, her, to, come, and, kiss, him, goodnight, even, on, nights, when, the, family, has, company, culminating, in, a, spectacular, success, when, his, father, suggests, that, his, mother, stay, the, night, with, him, after, he, has, waylaid, her, in, the, hall, when, she, is, going, to, bed, his, anxiety, leads, to, manipulation, much, like, the, manipulation, employed, by, his, invalid, aunt, l, onie, and, all, the, lovers, in, the, entire, book, who, use, the, same, methods, of, petty, tyranny, to, manipulate, and, possess, their, loved, ones, the, nature, of, art, is, a, motif, in, the, novel, and, is, often, explored, at, great, length, proust, sets, forth, a, theory, of, art, in, which, we, are, all, capable, of, producing, art, if, by, this, we, mean, taking, the, experiences, of, life, and, transforming, them, in, a, way, that, shows, understanding, and, maturity, writing, painting, and, music, are, also, discussed, at, great, length, morel, the, violinist, is, examined, to, give, an, example, of, a, certain, type, of, artistic, character, along, with, other, fictional, artists, like, the, novelist, bergotte, the, composer, vinteuil, and, the, painter, elstir, as, early, as, the, combray, section, of, swann, s, way, the, narrator, is, concerned, with, his, ability, to, write, since, he, desires, to, pursue, a, writing, career, the, transmutation, of, the, experience, of, a, scene, in, one, of, the, family, s, usual, walks, into, a, short, descriptive, passage, is, described, and, the, sample, passage, given, the, narrator, presents, this, passage, as, an, early, sample, of, his, own, writing, in, which, he, has, only, had, to, alter, a, few, words, the, question, of, his, own, genius, relates, to, all, the, passages, in, which, genius, is, recognized, or, misunderstood, because, it, presents, itself, in, the, guise, of, a, humble, friend, rather, than, a, passionate, artiste, the, question, of, taste, or, judgement, in, art, is, also, an, important, theme, as, exemplified, by, swann, s, exquisite, taste, in, art, which, is, often, hidden, from, his, friends, who, do, not, share, it, or, subordinated, to, his, love, interests, questions, pertaining, to, homosexuality, appear, throughout, the, novel, particularly, in, the, later, volumes, the, first, arrival, of, this, theme, comes, in, the, combray, section, of, swann, s, way, where, the, daughter, of, the, piano, teacher, and, composer, vinteuil, is, seduced, and, the, narrator, observes, her, having, lesbian, relations, in, front, of, the, portrait, of, her, recently, deceased, father, the, narrator, invariably, suspects, his, lovers, of, liaisons, with, other, women, a, repetition, of, the, suspicions, held, by, charles, swann, about, his, mistress, and, eventual, wife, odette, in, swann, s, way, the, first, chapter, of, cities, of, the, plain, sodom, and, gomorrah, includes, a, detailed, account, of, a, sexual, encounter, between, m, de, charlus, the, novel, s, most, prominent, male, homosexual, and, his, tailor, critics, have, often, observed, that, while, the, character, of, the, narrator, is, ostensibly, heterosexual, proust, intimates, that, the, narrator, is, a, closeted, homosexual, the, narrator, s, manner, towards, male, homosexuality, is, consistently, aloof, yet, the, narrator, is, unaccountably, knowledgeable, this, strategy, enables, proust, to, pursue, themes, related, to, male, homosexuality, in, particular, the, nature, of, closetedness, from, both, within, and, without, a, homosexual, perspective, proust, does, not, designate, charlus, s, homosexuality, until, the, middle, of, the, novel, in, cities, afterwards, the, baron, s, ostentatiousness, and, flamboyance, of, which, he, is, blithely, unaware, completely, absorb, the, narrator, s, perception, lesbianism, on, the, other, hand, tortures, swann, and, the, narrator, because, it, presents, an, inaccessible, world, whereas, male, homosexual, desire, is, recognizable, insofar, as, it, encompasses, male, sexuality, odette, s, and, albertine, s, lesbian, trysts, represent, swann, and, the, narrator, s, painful, exclusion, from, characters, they, desire, there, is, much, debate, as, to, how, great, a, bearing, proust, s, sexuality, has, on, understanding, these, aspects, of, the, novel, although, many, of, proust, s, close, family, and, friends, suspected, that, he, was, homosexual, proust, never, admitted, this, it, was, only, after, his, death, that, andr, gide, in, his, publication, of, correspondence, with, proust, made, public, proust, s, homosexuality, in, response, to, gide, s, criticism, that, he, hid, his, actual, sexuality, within, his, novel, proust, told, gide, that, one, can, say, anything, so, long, as, one, does, not, say, i, proust, s, intimate, relations, with, such, individuals, as, alfred, agostinelli, and, reynaldo, hahn, are, well, documented, though, proust, was, not, out, and, proud, except, perhaps, in, close, knit, social, circles, in, 1949, the, critic, justin, o, brien, published, an, article, in, the, publications, of, the, modern, language, association, called, albertine, the, ambiguous, notes, on, proust, s, transposition, of, sexes, in, which, he, proposed, that, some, female, characters, are, best, understood, as, actually, referring, to, young, men, strip, off, the, feminine, ending, of, the, names, of, the, narrator, s, lovers, albertine, gilberte, and, andr, e, and, one, has, their, masculine, counterparts, this, theory, has, become, known, as, the, transposition, of, sexes, theory, in, proust, criticism, but, it, has, been, challenged, in, epistemology, of, the, closet, 1990, by, eve, kosofsky, sedgwick, and, in, proust, s, lesbianism, 1999, by, elisabeth, ladenson, feminized, forms, of, masculine, names, were, and, are, commonplace, in, french, in, search, of, lost, time, is, considered, by, many, scholars, and, critics, to, be, the, definitive, modern, novel, it, has, had, a, profound, effect, on, subsequent, writers, such, as, the, british, authors, who, were, members, of, the, bloomsbury, group, virginia, woolf, wrote, in, 1922, oh, if, i, could, write, like, that, edith, wharton, wrote, that, every, reader, enamoured, of, the, art, must, brood, in, amazement, over, the, way, in, which, proust, maintains, the, balance, between, these, two, manners, the, broad, and, the, minute, his, endowment, as, a, novelist, his, range, of, presentation, combined, with, mastery, of, his, instruments, has, probably, never, been, surpassed, during, proust, s, lifetime, on, the, other, hand, while, he, would, achieve, success, he, would, also, face, criticism, from, critics, of, his, work, according, to, cambridge, university, press, proust, s, reception, during, his, lifetime, is, always, set, against, the, backdrop, of, often, hostile, criticism, frequently, based, on, the,
