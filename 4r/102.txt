genre, determining, what, exactly, defines, a, short, story, remains, problematic, a, classic, definition, of, a, short, story, is, that, one, should, be, able, to, read, it, in, one, sitting, a, point, most, notably, made, in, edgar, allan, poe, s, essay, the, philosophy, of, composition, 1846, h, g, wells, described, the, purpose, of, the, short, story, as, the, jolly, art, of, making, something, very, bright, and, moving, it, may, be, horrible, or, pathetic, or, funny, or, profoundly, illuminating, having, only, this, essential, that, it, should, take, from, fifteen, to, fifty,

keep, up, long, enough, to, put, down, what, he, says, and, does, some, authors, have, argued, that, a, short, story, must, have, a, strict, form, somerset, maugham, thought, that, the, short, story,

story, should, be, a, story, a, record, of, things, happening, full, of, incidents, swift, movements, unexpected, development, leading, through, suspense, to, a, climax, and, a, satisfying, denouement, this, view, of, the, short, story, as, a, finished, product, of, art, is, however, opposed, by, anton, chekhov, who, thought, that, a, story, should, have, neither, a, beginning, nor, an, end, it, should, just, be, a, slice, of, life, presented, suggestively, in, his, stories, chekhov, does, not, round, off, the, end, but, leaves, it, to, the, readers, to, draw, their, own,

to, resist, categorization, by, genre, and, fixed, formation, william, boyd, a, british, author, and, short, story, writer, has, said, seem, to, answer, something, very, deep, in, our, nature, as, if, for, the, duration, of, its, telling, something, special, has, been, created, some, essence, of, our, experience, extrapolated, some, temporary, sense, has, been, made, of, our, common, turbulent, journey, towards, the, grave, and, oblivion, in, the, 1880s, the, term, short, story, acquired, its, modern, meaning, having, initially, referred, to, children, s, tales, during, the, early, to, mid, 20th, century, the, short, story, underwent, expansive, experimentation, which, further, hindered, attempts, to, comprehensively, provide, a, definition, longer, stories, that, cannot, be, called, novels, are, sometimes, considered, novellas, or, novelettes, and, like, short, stories, may, be, collected, into, the, more, marketable, form, of, collections, of, stories, previously, unpublished, or, published, but, elsewhere, sometimes, authors, who, do, not, have, the, time, or, money, to, write, a, novella, or, novel, decide, to, write, short, stories, instead, working, out, a, deal, with, a, popular, website, or, magazine, to, publish, them, for, profit, around, the, world, the, modern, short, story, is, comparable, to, lyrics, dramas, novels, and, essays, although, examination, of,

short, stories, have, up, to, 15, 000, words, stories, of, fewer, than, 1, 000, words, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, short, short, stories, or, flash, fiction, short, stories, have, no, set, length, in, terms, of, word, count, there, is, no, official, demarcation, between, an, anecdote, a, short, story, and, a, novel, rather, the, form, s, parameters, are, given, by, the, rhetorical, and,

the, novel, the, short, story, s, predominant, shape, reflects, the, demands, of, the, available, markets, for, publication, and, the, evolution, of, the, form, seems, closely, tied, to, the,
