the, legends, of, their, native, cultures, in, the, indian, mah, k, vya, epic, genre, more, emphasis, was, laid, on, description, than, on, narration, indeed, the, traditional, characteristics, of, a,

things, with, the, hero, at, his, lowest, point, usually, flashbacks, show, earlier, portions, of, the, story, for, example, the, iliad, does, not, tell, the, entire, story, of, the, trojan, war, starting, with, the, judgment, of, paris, but, instead, opens, abruptly, on, the, rage, of, achilles, and, its, immediate, causes, so, too, orlando, furioso, is, not, a, complete, biography, of, roland, but, picks, up, from, the, plot, of, orlando, innamorato, which, in, turn, presupposes, a, knowledge, of, the, romance, and, oral, traditions, epic, catalogues, and, genealogies, are, given,

importance, of, line, consistency, and, poetic, meter, ancient, greek, epics, were, composed, in, dactylic, hexameter, very, early, latin, epicists, such, livius, andronicus, and, gnaeus, naevius,
