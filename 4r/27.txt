the, acropolis, of, athens, ancient, greek, romanized, h, akropolis, t, n, ath, n, n, modern, greek, romanized, akr, poli, athin, n, is, an, ancient, citadel, located, on, a, rocky, outcrop, above, the, city, of, athens, greece, and, contains, the, remains, of, several, ancient, buildings, of, great, architectural, and, historical, significance, the, most, famous, being, the, parthenon, the, word, acropolis, is, from, the, greek, words, akron, highest, point, extremity, and, polis, city, the, term, acropolis, is, generic, and, there, are, many, other, acropoleis, in, greece, during, ancient, times, the, acropolis, of, athens, was, also, more, properly, known, as, cecropia, after, the, legendary, serpent, man, cecrops, the, supposed, first, athenian, king, while, there, is, evidence, that, the, hill, was, inhabited, as, early, as, the, fourth, millennium, bc, it, was, pericles, c, 495, 429, bc, in, the, fifth, century, bc, who, coordinated, the, construction, of, the, buildings, whose, present, remains, are, the, site, s, most, important, ones, including, the, parthenon, the, propylaea, the, erechtheion, and, the, temple, of, athena, nike, the, parthenon, and, the, other, buildings, were, seriously, damaged, during, the, 1687, siege, by, the, venetians, during, the, morean, war, when, gunpowder, being, stored, by, the, then, turkish, rulers, in, the, parthenon, was, hit, by, a, venetian, bombardment, and, exploded, the, acropolis, is, located, on, a, flattish, topped, rock, that, rises, 150, m, 490, ft, above, sea, level, in, the, city, of, athens, with, a, surface, area, of, about, 3, ha, 7, 4, acres, while, the, earliest, artifacts, date, to, the, middle, neolithic, era, there, have, been, documented, habitations, in, attica, from, the, early, neolithic, period, 6th, millennium, bc, there, is, little, doubt, that, a, mycenaean, megaron, palace, stood, upon, the, hill, during, the, late, bronze, age, nothing, of, this, structure, survives, except, probably, a, single, limestone, column, base, and, pieces, of, several, sandstone, steps, soon, after, the, palace, was, constructed, a, cyclopean, massive, circuit, wall, was, built, 760, meters, long, up, to, 10, meters, high, and, ranging, from, 3, 5, to, 6, meters, thick, from, the, end, of, the, helladic, iiib, 1300, 1200, bc, on, this, wall, would, serve, as, the, main, defense, for, the, acropolis, until, the, 5th, century, the, wall, consisted, of, two, parapets, built, with, large, stone, blocks, and, cemented, with, an, earth, mortar, called, emplekton, greek, the, wall, uses, typical, mycenaean, conventions, in, that, it, followed, the, natural, contour, of, the, terrain, and, its, gate, which, was, towards, the, south, was, arranged, obliquely, with, a, parapet, and, tower, overhanging, the, incomers, right, hand, side, thus, facilitating, defense, there, were, two, lesser, approaches, up, the, hill, on, its, north, side, consisting, of, steep, narrow, flights, of, steps, cut, in, the, rock, homer, is, assumed, to, refer, to, this, fortification, when, he, mentions, the, strong, built, house, of, erechtheus, odyssey, 7, 81, at, some, time, before, the, 13th, century, bc, an, earthquake, caused, a, fissure, near, the, northeastern, edge, of, the, acropolis, this, fissure, extended, some, 35, meters, to, a, bed, of, soft, marl, in, which, a, well, was, dug, an, elaborate, set, of, stairs, was, built, and, the, well, served, as, an, invaluable, protected, source, of, drinking, water, during, times, of, siege, for, some, portion, of, the, mycenaean, period, not, much, is, known, about, the, architectural, appearance, of, the, acropolis, until, the, archaic, era, during, the, 7th, and, the, 6th, centuries, bc, the, site, was, controlled, by, kylon, during, the, failed, kylonian, revolt, and, twice, by, peisistratos, each, of, these, was, attempts, directed, at, seizing, political, power, by, coups, d, tat, apart, from, the, hekatompedon, mentioned, later, peisistratos, also, built, an, entry, gate, or, propylaea, nevertheless, it, seems, that, a, nine, gate, wall, the, enneapylon, had, been, built, around, the, acropolis, hill, and, incorporated, the, biggest, water, spring, the, clepsydra, at, the, northwestern, foot, a, temple, to, athena, polias, the, tutelary, deity, of, the, city, was, erected, between, 570, and, 550, bc, this, doric, limestone, building, from, which, many, relics, survive, is, referred, to, as, the, hekatompedon, greek, for, hundred, footed, ur, parthenon, german, for, original, parthenon, or, primitive, parthenon, h, architecture, or, bluebeard, temple, after, the, pedimental, three, bodied, man, serpent, sculpture, whose, beards, were, painted, dark, blue, whether, this, temple, replaced, an, older, one, or, just, a, sacred, precinct, or, altar, is, not, known, probably, the, hekatompedon, was, built, where, the, parthenon, now, stands, between, 529, and, 520, bc, yet, another, temple, was, built, by, the, pisistratids, the, old, temple, of, athena, usually, referred, to, as, the, arkhaios, ne, s, ancient, temple, this, temple, of, athena, polias, was, built, upon, the, d, rpfeld, foundations, between, the, erechtheion, and, the, still, standing, parthenon, the, arkhaios, ne, s, was, destroyed, as, part, of, the, achaemenid, destruction, of, athens, during, the, second, persian, invasion, of, greece, during, 480, 479, bc, however, the, temple, was, probably, reconstructed, during, 454, bc, since, the, treasury, of, the, delian, league, was, transferred, in, its, opisthodomos, the, temple, may, have, been, burnt, down, during, 406, 405, bc, as, xenophon, mentions, that, the, old, temple, of, athena, was, set, afire, pausanias, does, not, mention, it, in, his, 2nd, century, ad, description, of, greece, around, 500, bc, the, hekatompedon, was, dismantled, to, make, place, for, a, new, grander, building, the, older, parthenon, often, referred, to, as, the, pre, parthenon, or, early, parthenon, for, this, reason, athenians, decided, to, stop, the, construction, of, the, olympieion, temple, which, was, connoted, with, the, tyrant, peisistratos, and, his, sons, and, instead, used, the, piraeus, limestone, destined, for, the, olympieion, to, build, the, older, parthenon, to, accommodate, the, new, temple, the, south, part, of, the, summit, was, cleared, made, level, by, adding, some, 8, 000, two, ton, blocks, of, limestone, a, foundation, 11, m, 36, ft, deep, at, some, points, and, the, rest, was, filled, with, soil, kept, in, place, by, the, retaining, wall, however, after, the, victorious, battle, of, marathon, in, 490, bc, the, plan, was, revised, and, marble, was, used, instead, the, limestone, phase, of, the, building, is, referred, to, as, pre, parthenon, i, and, the, marble, phase, as, pre, parthenon, ii, in, 485, bc, construction, stalled, to, save, resources, as, xerxes, became, king, of, persia, and, war, seemed, imminent, the, older, parthenon, was, still, under, construction, when, the, persians, invaded, and, sacked, the, city, in, 480, bc, the, building, was, burned, and, looted, along, with, the, ancient, temple, and, practically, everything, else, on, the, rock, after, the, persian, crisis, had, subsided, the, athenians, incorporated, many, architectural, parts, of, the, unfinished, temple, unfluted, column, drums, triglyphs, metopes, etc, into, the, newly, built, northern, curtain, wall, of, the, acropolis, where, they, served, as, a, prominent, war, memorial, and, can, still, be, seen, today, the, devastated, site, was, cleared, of, debris, statuary, cult, objects, religious, offerings, and, unsalvageable, architectural, members, were, buried, ceremoniously, in, several, deeply, dug, pits, on, the, hill, serving, conveniently, as, a, fill, for, the, artificial, plateau, created, around, the, classical, parthenon, this, persian, debris, was, the, richest, archaeological, deposit, excavated, on, the, acropolis, by, 1890, after, winning, at, eurymedon, during, 468, bc, cimon, and, themistocles, ordered, the, reconstruction, of, the, southern, and,

the, temple, was, finished, during, the, time, of, nicias, peace, between, 421, bc, and, 409, bc, construction, of, the, elegant, temple, of, erechtheion, in, pentelic, marble, 421, 406, bc, was, by, a, complex, plan, which, took, account, of, the, extremely, uneven, ground, and, the, need, to, circumvent, several, shrines, in, the, area, the, entrance, facing, east, is, lined, with, six, ionic, columns, unusually, the, temple, has, two, porches, one, on, the, northwest, corner, borne, by, ionic, columns, the, other, to, the, southwest, supported, by, huge, female, figures, or, caryatids, the, eastern, part, of, the, temple, was, dedicated, to, athena, polias, while, the, western, part, serving, the, cult, of, the, archaic, king, poseidon, erechtheus, housed, the, altars, of, hephaestus, and, voutos, brother, of, erechtheus, little, is, known, about, the, original, plan, of, the, interior, which, was, destroyed, by, fire, during, the, first, century, bc, and, has, been, rebuilt, several, times, during, the, same, period, a, combination, of, sacred, precincts, including, the, temples, of, athena, polias, poseidon, erechtheus, cecrops, herse, pandrosos, and, aglauros,

been, invoked, as, a, critical, symbol, of, the, greek, legacy, and, of, the, glories, of, classical, greece, most, of, the, artifacts, from, the, temple, are, housed, today, in, the, acropolis, museum, at, the, foot, of, the, ancient, rock, the, acropolis, is, a, klippe, consisting, of, two, lithostratigraphic, units, the, athens, schist, and, the, overlying, acropolis, limestone, the, athens, schist, is, a, soft, reddish, rock, dating, from, the, late, cretaceous, period, the, original, sediments, were, deposited, in, a, river, delta, approximately, 72, million, years, ago, the, acropolis, limestone, dates, from, the, late, jurassic, period, predating, the, underlying, athens, schist, by, about, 30, million, years, the, acropolis, limestone, was, thrust, over, the, athens, schist, by, compressional, tectonic, forces, forming, a, nappe, or, overthrust, sheet, erosion, of, the, limestone, nappe, led, to, the, eventual, detachment, of, the, acropolis, forming, the, present, day, feature, where, the, athens, schist, and, the, limestone, meet, there, are, springs, and, karstic, caves, many, of, the, hills, in, the, athens, region, were, formed, by, the, erosion, of, the, same, nappe, as, the, acropolis, these, include, the, hills, of, lykabettos, areopagus, and, mouseion, the, marble, used, for, the, buildings, of, the, acropolis, was, sourced, from, the, quarries, of, mount, pentelicus, a, mountain, to, the, northeast, of, the, city, the, limestone, that, the, acropolis, is, built, upon, is, unstable, because, of, the, erosion, and, tectonic, shifts, that, the, region, is, prone, to, this, instability, may, cause, rock, slides, that, cause, damage, to, the, historic, site, various, measures, have, been, implemented, to, protect, the, site, including, retaining, walls, drainage, systems, and, rock, bolts, these, measures, work, to, counter, the, natural, processes, that, threaten, the, historic, site, notes, bibliography, videos
