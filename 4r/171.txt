and, no, longer, questions, his, faith, he, realizes, that, one, must, decide, for, oneself, what, is, acceptable, concerning, one, s, own, faith, and, beliefs, he, chooses, not, to, tell, kitty, of,

a, christian, kostya, is, initially, displeased, that, his, return, to, his, faith, does, not, bring, with, it, a, complete, transformation, to, righteousness, however, at, the, end, of, the, story, kostya, arrives, at, the, conclusion, that, despite, his, newly, accepted, beliefs, he, is, human, and, will, go, on, making, mistakes, his, life, can, now, be, meaningfully, and, truthfully, oriented, toward, righteousness, tolstoy, s, style, in, anna, karenina, is, considered, by, many, critics, to, be, transitional, forming, a, bridge, between, the, realist, and, modernist, novel, according, to, ruth, benson, in, her, book, about, tolstoy, s, heroines, tolstoy, s, diaries, show, how, displeased, he, was, with, his, style, and, approach, to, writing, in, early, drafts, of, anna,

passion, and, the, agrarian, connection, to, land, in, contrast, to, the, lifestyles, of, the, city, according, to, literary, theorist, cornelius, quassus, in, the, novel, anna, karenina, unofficial, institutions, of, the, system, presented, through, social, salons, function, as, part, of, the, power, apparatus, that, successfully, calms, the, disorder, created, by, anna, s, irrational, emotional, action, which, is, a, symbol, of, resistance, to, the, system, of, social, behavioral, control, translator, rosemary, edmonds, wrote, that, tolstoy, does, not, explicitly, moralize, in, the, book, but, instead, allows, his, themes, to, emerge, naturally, from, the, vast, panorama, of, russian, life, she, also, says, one, of, the, novel, s, key, messages, is, that, no, one, may, build, their, happiness, on, another, s, pain, levin, is, often, considered, a, semi, autobiographical, portrayal, of, tolstoy, s, own, beliefs, struggles, and, life, events, tolstoy, s, first, name, was, lev, and, the, russian, surname, levin, means, of, lev, according, to, footnotes, in, the, pevear, volokhonsky, translation, the, viewpoints, levin, supports, throughout, the, novel, in, his, arguments, match,

request, that, his, fianc, e, read, his, diary, as, a, way, of, disclosing, his, faults, and, previous, sexual, encounters, parallels, tolstoy, s, own, requests, to, his, fianc, e, behrs, the, events, in, the, novel, take, place, against, the, backdrop, of, rapid, transformations, as, a, result, of, the, liberal, reforms, initiated, by, emperor, alexander, ii, of, russia, principal, among, these, the, emancipation, reform, of, 1861, followed, by, judicial, reform, including, a, jury, system, military, reforms, the, introduction, of, elected, local, governments, zemstvo, the, fast, development, of, railroads, banks, industry, telegraph, the, rise, of, new, business, elites, and, the, decline, of, the, old, landed, aristocracy, a, freer, press, the, awakening, of, public, opinion, the, pan, slavism, movement, the, woman, question, volunteering, to, aid, serbia, in, its, military, conflict, with, the, ottoman, empire, in, 1876, etc, these, contemporary, developments, are, hotly, debated, by, the, characters, in, the, novel, the, suburban, railway, station, of, obiralovka, where, one, of, the, characters, commits, suicide, is, now, known, as, the, town, of, zheleznodorozhny, moscow, oblast, anna, karenina, s, immediate, reception, in, the, united, states, was, mixed, with, the, work, s, themes, and, eponymous, character, receiving, praise, but, its, length, and, depiction, of, suicide, receiving, criticism, writing, in, the, year, 2000, academic, zoja, pavlovskis, petit, compared, the, different, translations, of, anna, karenina, on, the, market, commenting, on, the, revision, of, constance, garnett, s, 1901, translation, she, says, the, revision, 1965, by, kent, berberova, the, latter, no, mean, stylist, herself, succeeds, in, correcting, errors, tightening, the, prose, converting, briticisms, and, casting, light, on, areas, mrs, garnett, did, not, explore, their, edition, shows, an, excellent, understanding, of, the, details, of, tolstoy, s, world, for, instance, the, fact, that, the, elaborate, coiffure, kitty, wears, to, the, ball, is, not, her, own, hair, a, detail, that, eludes, most, other, translators, and, at, the, same, time, they, use, english, imaginatively, kitty, s, shoes, delighted, her, feet, rather, than, seemed, to, make, her, feet, lighter, maude, a, paraphrase, the, purist, will, be, pleased, to, see, kent, berberova, give, all, the, russian, names, in, full, as, used, by, the, author, any, reader, will, be, grateful, for, the, footnotes, that, elucidate, anything, not, immediately, accessible, to, someone, not, well, acquainted, with, imperial, russia, this, emended, garnett, should, probably, be, a, reader, s, first, choice, she, further, comments, on, the, maudes, translation, the, revised, garnett, and, the, magarshack, versions, do, better, justice, to, the, original, but, still, the, world, s, classics, edition, 1995, offers, a, very, full, list, of, characters, and, good, notes, based, on, the, maudes, on, edmonds, s, translation, she, states, has, the, advantage, of, solid, scholarship, yet, she, lacks, a, true, sensitivity, for, the, language, to, missing, many, a, subtlety, on, carmichael, s, version, she, comments, this, is, a, rather, breezily, readable, translation, but, there, are, errors, and, misunderstandings, as, well, as, clumsiness, on, magarshack, s, translation, she, comments, offers, natural, simple, and, direct, english, prose, that, is, appropriate, to, tolstoy, s, russian, there, is, occasional, awkwardness, and, imprecision, but, magarshack, understands, the, text, and, even, when, unable, to, translate, an, idiom, closely, he, renders, its, real, meaning, this, is, a, good, translation, on, wettlin, s, soviet, version, she, writes, steady, but, uninspired, and, sounds, like, english, prose, written, by, a, russian, who, knows, the, language, but, is, not, completely, at, home, in, it, the, advantage, is, that, wettlin, misses, hardly, any, cultural, detail, in, in, quest, of, tolstoy, 2008, hughes, mclean, devotes, a, full, chapter, which, english, anna, comparing, different, translations, of, anna, karenina, his, conclusion, after, comparing, seven, translations, is, that, the, pv, translation, while, perfectly, adequate, is, in, my, view, not, consistently, or, unequivocally, superior, to, others, in, the, market, he, states, his, recommendations, in, the, last, two, pages, of, the, survey, none, of, the, existing, translations, is, actively, bad, one, s, choice, must, therefore, be, based, on, nuances, subtleties, and, refinements, he, eliminates, the, maudes, for, disturbing, errors, and, did, not, find, either, the, margashack, or, carmichael, ever, superior, to, the, others, and, the, lack, of, notes, is, a, drawback, on, edmonds, s, version, he, states, her, version, has, no, notes, at, all, and, all, too, frequently, errs, in, the, direction, of, making, tolstoy, s, robust, awkwardness, conform, to, the, translator, s, notion, of, good, english, style, mclean, s, recommendations, are, the, kent, berberova, revision, of, garnett, s, translation, and, the, pevear, and, volokhonsky, version, i, consider, the, gkb, a, very, good, version, even, though, it, is, based, on, an, out, of, date, russian, text, kent, and, berberova, did, a, much, more, thorough, and, careful, revision, of, garnett, s, translation, than, gibian, did, of, the, maude, one, and, they, have, supplied, fairly, full, notes, conveniently, printed, at, the, bottom, of, the, page, mclean, takes, pevear, and, volokhonsky, to, task, for, not, using, the, best, critical, text, the, zaidenshnur, zhdanov, text, and, offering, flawed, notes, without, consulting, c, j, turner, s, a, karenina, companion, 1993, although, he, calls, their, version, certainly, a, good, translation, reviewing, the, translations, by, bartlett, and, schwartz, for, the, new, york, times, book, review, masha, gessen, noted, that, each, new, translation, of, anna, karenina, ended, up, highlighting, an, aspect, of, tolstoy, s, variable, voice, in, the, novel, and, thus, the, tolstoy, of, garnett, is, a, monocled, british, gentleman, who, is, simply, incapable, of, taking, his, characters, as, seriously, as, they, take, themselves, pevear, and, volokhonsky, created, a, reasonable, calm, storyteller, who, communicated, in, conversational, american, english, rosamund, bartlett, creates, an, updated, ironic, brit, version, of, tolstoy, marian, schwartz, has, produced, what, is, probably, the, least, smooth, talking, and, most, contradictory, tolstoy, yet, gessen, found, schwartz, s, translation, to, be, formally, closer, to, the, original, russian, but, often, weighed, down, with, details, as, a, result, bartlett, s, translation, like, pevear, and, volokhonsky, s, was, rendered, in, more, idiomatic, english, and, more, readable, the, title, has, been, translated, as, both, anna, karenin, and, anna, karenina, the, first, instance, eschews, the, russian, practice, of, employing, gender, specific, forms, of, surnames, instead, using, the, masculine, form, for, all, characters, the, second, is, a, direct, transliteration, of, the, actual, russian, name, vladimir, nabokov, explains, in, russian, a, surname, ending, in, a, consonant, acquires, a, final, a, except, for, the, cases, of, such, names, that, cannot, be, declined, and, except, adjectives, like, oblonskaya, when, designating, a, woman, since, surnames, are, not, gendered, in, english, proponents, of, the, first, convention, removing, the, russian, a, to, naturalize, the, name, into, english, argue, that, it, is, more, consistent, with, english, naming, practice, and, should, be, followed, in, an, english, translation, nabokov, for, instance, recommends, that, only, when, the, reference, is, to, a, female, stage, performer, should, english, feminise, a, russian, surname, following, a, french, custom, la, pavlova, the, pavlova, ivanov, s, and, karenin, s, wives, are, mrs, ivanov, and, mrs, karenin, in, britain, and, the, us, not, mrs, ivanova, or, mrs, karenina, the, practice, favored, by, most, translators, however, has, been, to, allow, anna, s, actual, russian, name, to, stand, larissa, volokhonsky, herself, a, russian, prefers, the, second, option, as, did, aylmer, and, louise, maude, who, lived, in, russia, for, many, years, and, were, friends, of, tolstoy, a, handful, of, other, translators, including, constance, garnett, and, rosemary, edmonds, both, non, russians, prefer, the, first, the, novel, has, been, adapted, into, various, media, including, opera, film, television, ballet, and, radio, drama, the, first, film, adaptation, was, released, in, 1911, but, has, not, survived
