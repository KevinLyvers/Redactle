folk, music, is, a, music, genre, that, includes, traditional, folk, music, and, the, contemporary, genre, that, evolved, from, the, former, during, the, 20th, century, folk, revival, some, types, of, folk, music, may, be, called, world, music, traditional, folk, music, has, been, defined, in, several, ways, as, music, transmitted, orally, music, with, unknown, composers, music, that, is, played, on, traditional, instruments, music, about, cultural, or, national, identity, music, that, changes, between, generations, folk, process, music, associated, with, a, people, s, folklore, or, music, performed, by, custom, over, a, long, period, of, time, it, has, been, contrasted, with, commercial, and, classical, styles, the, term, originated, in, the, 19th, century, but, folk, music, extends, beyond, that, starting, in, the, mid, 20th, century, a, new, form, of, popular, folk, music, evolved, from, traditional, folk, music, this, process, and, period, is, called, the, second, folk, revival, and, reached, a, zenith, in, the, 1960s, this, form, of, music, is, sometimes, called, contemporary, folk, music, or, folk, revival, music, to, distinguish, it, from, earlier, folk, forms, smaller, similar, revivals, have, occurred, elsewhere, in, the, world, at, other, times, but, the, term, folk, music, has, typically, not, been, applied, to, the, new, music, created, during, those, revivals, this, type, of, folk, music, also, includes, fusion, genres, such, as, folk, rock, folk, metal, and, others, while, contemporary, folk, music, is, a, genre, generally, distinct, from, traditional, folk, music, in, u, s, english, it, shares, the, same, name, and, it, often, shares, the, same, performers, and, venues, as, traditional, folk, music, the, terms, folk, music, folk, song, and, folk, dance, are, comparatively, recent, expressions, they, are, extensions, of, the, term, folklore, which, was, coined, in, 1846, by, the, english, antiquarian, william, thoms, to, describe, the, traditions, customs, and, superstitions, of, the, uncultured, classes, the, term, further, derives, from, the, german, expression, volk, in, the, sense, of, the, people, as, a, whole, as, applied, to, popular, and, national, music, by, johann, gottfried, herder, and, the, german, romantics, over, half, a, century, earlier, though, it, is, understood, that, folk, music, is, the, music, of, the, people, observers, find, a, more, precise, definition, to, be, elusive, some, do, not, even, agree, that, the, term, folk, music, should, be, used, folk, music, may, tend, to, have, certain, characteristics, but, it, cannot, clearly, be, differentiated, in, purely, musical, terms, one, meaning, often, given, is, that, of, old, songs, with, no, known, composers, another, is, that, of, music, that, has, been, submitted, to, an, evolutionary, process, of, oral, transmission, the, fashioning, and, re, fashioning, of, the, music, by, the, community, that, give, it, its, folk, character, such, definitions, depend, upon, cultural, processes, rather, than, abstract, musical, types, upon, continuity, and, oral, transmission, seen, as, characterizing, one, side, of, a, cultural, dichotomy, the, other, side, of, which, is, found, not, only, in, the, lower, layers, of, feudal, capitalist, and, some, oriental, societies, but, also, in, primitive, societies, and, in, parts, of, popular, cultures, one, widely, used, definition, is, simply, folk, music, is, what, the, people, sing, for, scholes, as, well, as, for, cecil, sharp, and, b, la, bart, k, there, was, a, sense, of, the, music, of, the, country, as, distinct, from, that, of, the, town, folk, music, was, already, seen, as, the, authentic, expression, of, a, way, of, life, now, past, or, about, to, disappear, or, in, some, cases, to, be, preserved, or, somehow, revived, particularly, in, a, community, uninfluenced, by, art, music, and, by, commercial, and, printed, song, lloyd, rejected, this, in, favor, of, a, simple, distinction, of, economic, class, yet, for, him, true, folk, music, was, in, charles, seeger, s, words, associated, with, a, lower, class, in, culturally, and, socially, stratified, societies, in, these, terms, folk, music, may, be, seen, as, part, of, a, schema, comprising, four, musical, types, primitive, or, tribal, elite, or, art, folk, and, popular, music, in, this, genre, is, also, often, called, traditional, music, although, the, term, is, usually, only, descriptive, in, some, cases, people, use, it, as, the, name, of, a, genre, for, example, the, grammy, award, previously, used, the, terms, traditional, music, and, traditional, folk, for, folk, music, that, is, not, contemporary, folk, music, folk, music, may, include, most, indigenous, music, from, a, historical, perspective, traditional, folk, music, had, these, characteristics, as, a, side, effect, the, following, characteristics, are, sometimes, present, in, folk, music, a, tune, is, a, short, instrumental, piece, a, melody, often, with, repeating, sections, and, usually, played, a, number, of, times, a, collection, of, tunes, with, structural, similarities, is, known, as, a, tune, family, america, s, musical, landscape, says, the, most, common, form, for, tunes, in, folk, music, is, aabb, also, known, as, binary, form, in, some, traditions, tunes, may, be, strung, together, in, medleys, or, sets, throughout, most, of, human, prehistory, and, history, listening, to, recorded, music, was, not, possible, music, was, made, by, common, people, during, both, their, work, and, leisure, as, well, as, during, religious, activities, the, work, of, economic, production, was, often, manual, and, communal, manual, labor, often, included, singing, by, the, workers, which, served, several, practical, purposes, it, reduced, the, boredom, of, repetitive, tasks, it, kept, the, rhythm, during, synchronized, pushes, and, pulls, and, it, set, the, pace, of, many, activities, such, as, planting, weeding, reaping, threshing, weaving, and, milling, in, leisure, time, singing, and, playing, musical, instruments, were, common, forms, of, entertainment, and, history, telling, even, more, common, than, today, when, electrically, enabled, technologies, and, widespread, literacy, make, other, forms, of, entertainment, and, information, sharing, competitive, some, believe, that, folk, music, originated, as, art, music, that, was, changed, and, probably, debased, by, oral, transmission, while, reflecting, the, character, of, the, society, that, produced, it, in, many, societies, especially, preliterate, ones, the, cultural, transmission, of, folk, music, requires, learning, by, ear, although, notation, has, evolved, in, some, cultures, different, cultures, may, have, different, notions, concerning, a, division, between, folk, music, on, the, one, hand, and, of, art, and, court, music, on, the, other, in, the, proliferation, of, popular, music, genres, some, traditional, folk, music, became, also, referred, to, as, world, music, or, roots, music, the, english, term, folklore, to, describe, traditional, folk, music, and, dance, entered, the, vocabulary, of, many, continental, european, nations, each, of, which, had, its, folk, song, collectors, and, revivalists, the, distinction, between, authentic, folk, and, national, and, popular, song, in, general, has, always, been, loose, particularly, in, america, and, germany, for, example, popular, songwriters, such, as, stephen, foster, could, be, termed, folk, in, america, the, international, folk, music, council, definition, allows, that, the, term, can, also, apply, to, music, that, has, originated, with, an, individual, composer, and, has, subsequently, been, absorbed, into, the, unwritten, living, tradition, of, a, community, but, the, term, does, not, cover, a, song, dance, or, tune, that, has, been, taken, over, ready, made, and, remains, unchanged, the, post, world, war, ii, folk, revival, in, america, and, in, britain, started, a, new, genre, contemporary, folk, music, and, brought, an, additional, meaning, to, the, term, folk, music, newly, composed, songs, fixed, in, form, and, by, known, authors, which, imitated, some, form, of, traditional, music, the, popularity, of, contemporary, folk, recordings, caused, the, appearance, of, the, category, folk, in, the, grammy, awards, of, 1959, in, 1970, the, term, was, dropped, in, favor, of, best, ethnic, or, traditional, recording, including, traditional, blues, while, 1987, brought, a, distinction, between, best, traditional, folk, recording, and, best, contemporary, folk, recording, after, that, they, had, a, traditional, music, category, that, subsequently, evolved, into, others, the, term, folk, by, the, start, of, the, 21st, century, could, cover, singer, songwriters, such, as, donovan, from, scotland, and, american, bob, dylan, who, emerged, in, the, 1960s, and, much, more, this, completed, a, process, to, where, folk, music, no, longer, meant, only, traditional, folk, music, traditional, folk, music, often, includes, sung, words, although, folk, instrumental, music, occurs, commonly, in, dance, music, traditions, narrative, verse, looms, large, in, the, traditional, folk, music, of, many, cultures, this, encompasses, such, forms, as, traditional, epic, poetry, much, of, which, was, meant, originally, for, oral, performance, sometimes, accompanied, by, instruments, many, epic, poems, of, various, cultures, were, pieced, together, from, shorter, pieces, of, traditional, narrative, verse, which, explains, their, episodic, structure, repetitive, elements, and, their, frequent, in, medias, res, plot, developments, other, forms, of, traditional, narrative, verse, relate, the, outcomes, of, battles, or, lament, tragedies, or, natural, disasters, sometimes, as, in, the, triumphant, song, of, deborah, found, in, the, biblical, book, of, judges, these, songs, celebrate, victory, laments, for, lost, battles, and, wars, and, the, lives, lost, in, them, are, equally, prominent, in, many, traditions, these, laments, keep, alive, the, cause, for, which, the, battle, was, fought, the, narratives, of, traditional, songs, often, also, remember, folk, heroes, such, as, john, henry, or, robin, hood, some, traditional, song, narratives, recall, supernatural, events, or, mysterious, deaths, hymns, and, other, forms, of, religious, music, are, often, of, traditional, and, unknown, origin, western, musical, notation, was, originally, created, to, preserve, the, lines, of, gregorian, chant, which, before, its, invention, was, taught, as, an, oral, tradition, in, monastic, communities, traditional, songs, such, as, green, grow, the, rushes, o, present, religious, lore, in, a, mnemonic, form, as, do, western, christmas, carols, and, similar, traditional, songs, work, songs, frequently, feature, call, and, response, structures, and, are, designed, to, enable, the, laborers, who, sing, them, to, coordinate, their, efforts, in, accordance, with, the, rhythms, of, the, songs, they, are, frequently, but, not, invariably, composed, in, the, american, armed, forces, a, lively, oral, tradition, preserves, jody, calls, duckworth, chants, which, are, sung, while, soldiers, are, on, the, march, professional, sailors, made, similar, use, of, a, large, body, of, sea, shanties, love, poetry, often, of, a, tragic, or, regretful, nature, prominently, figures, in, many, folk, traditions, nursery, rhymes, children, s, songs, and, nonsense, verse, used, to, amuse, or, quiet, children, also, are, frequent, subjects, of, traditional, songs, music, transmitted, by, word, of, mouth, through, a, community, in, time, develops, many, variants, since, this, transmission, cannot, produce, word, for, word, and, note, for, note, accuracy, in, addition, folk, singers, may, choose, to, modify, the, songs, they, hear, for, example, around, 1970, the, song, mull, mohammed, j, n, spread, from, herat, to, the, rest, of, afghanistan, and, iran, where, it, was, recorded, due, to, its, repetitive, refrain, and, the, predictability, of, the, second, half, of, each, verse, it, allowed, for, both, its, popularization, and, for, each, singer, to, create, their, own, version, of, the, song, without, being, overly, concerned, for, a, melody, or, restrictive, poetic, rhythm, because, variants, proliferate, naturally, there, is, generally, no, authoritative, version, of, song, researchers, in, traditional, songs, have, encountered, countless, versions, of, the, barbara, allen, ballad, throughout, the, english, speaking, world, and, these, versions, often, differ, greatly, from, each, other, the, original, is, not, known, many, versions, can, lay, an, equal, claim, to, authenticity, influential, folklorist, cecil, sharp, felt, that, these, competing, variants, of, a, traditional, song, would, undergo, a, process, of, improvement, akin, to, biological, natural, selection, only, those, new, variants, that, were, the, most, appealing, to, ordinary, singers, would, be, picked, up, by, others, and, transmitted, onward, in, time, thus, over, time, we, would, expect, each, traditional, song, to, become, more, aesthetically, appealing, due, to, incremental, community, improvement, literary, interest, in, the, popular, ballad, form, dates, back, at, least, to, thomas, percy, and, william, wordsworth, english, elizabethan, and, stuart, composers, had, often, evolved, their, music, from, folk, themes, the, classical, suite, was, based, upon, stylised, folk, dances, and, joseph, haydn, s, use, of, folk, melodies, is, noted, but, the, emergence, of, the, term, folk, coincided, with, an, outburst, of, national, feeling, all, over, europe, that, was, particularly, strong, at, the, edges, of, europe, where, national, identity, was, most, asserted, nationalist, composers, emerged, in, central, europe, russia, scandinavia, spain, and, britain, the, music, of, dvo, k, smetana, grieg, rimsky, korsakov, brahms, liszt, de, falla, wagner, sibelius, vaughan, williams, bart, k, and, many, others, drew, upon, folk, melodies, while, the, loss, of, traditional, folk, music, in, the, face, of, the, rise, of, popular, music, is, a, worldwide, phenomenon, it, is, not, one, occurring, at, a, uniform, rate, throughout, the, world, the, process, is, most, advanced, where, industrialization, and, commercialisation, of, culture, are, most, advanced, but, also, occurs, more, gradually, even, in, settings, of, lower, technological, advancement, however, the, loss, of, traditional, music, is, slowed, in, nations, or, regions, where, traditional, folk, music, is, a, badge, of, cultural, or, national, identity, much, of, what, is, known, about, folk, music, prior, to, the, development, of, audio, recording, technology, in, the, 19th, century, comes, from, fieldwork, and, writings, of, scholars, collectors, and, proponents, starting, in, the, 19th, century, academics, and, amateur, scholars, taking, note, of, the, musical, traditions, being, lost, initiated, various, efforts, to, preserve, the, music, of, the, people, one, such, effort, was, the, collection, by, francis, james, child, in, the, late, 19th, century, of, the, texts, of, over, three, hundred, ballads, in, the, english, and, scots, traditions, called, the, child, ballads, some, of, which, predated, the, 16th, century, contemporaneously, with, child, the, reverend, sabine, baring, gould, and, later, cecil, sharp, worked, to, preserve, a, great, body, of, english, rural, traditional, song, music, and, dance, under, the, aegis, of, what, became, and, remains, the, english, folk, dance, and, song, society, efdss, sharp, campaigned, with, some, success, to, have, english, traditional, songs, in, his, own, heavily, edited, and, expurgated, versions, to, be, taught, to, school, children, in, hopes, of, reviving, and, prolonging, the, popularity, of, those, songs, throughout, the, 1960s, and, early, to, mid, 1970s, american, scholar, bertrand, harris, bronson, published, an, exhaustive, four, volume, collection, of, the, then, known, variations, of, both, the, texts, and, tunes, associated, with, what, came, to, be, known, as, the, child, canon, he, also, advanced, some, significant, theories, concerning, the, workings, of, oral, aural, tradition, similar, activity, was, also, under, way, in, other, countries, one, of, the, most, extensive, was, perhaps, the, work, done, in, riga, by, krisjanis, barons, who, between, the, years, 1894, and, 1915, published, six, volumes, that, included, the, texts, of, 217, 996, latvian, folk, songs, the, latvju, dainas, in, norway, the, work, of, collectors, such, as, ludvig, mathias, lindeman, was, extensively, used, by, edvard, grieg, in, his, lyric, pieces, for, piano, and, in, other, works, which, became, immensely, popular, around, this, time, composers, of, classical, music, developed, a, strong, interest, in, collecting, traditional, songs, and, a, number, of, composers, carried, out, their, own, field, work, on, traditional, music, these, included, percy, grainger, and, ralph, vaughan, williams, in, england, and, b, la, bart, k, in, hungary, these, composers, like, many, of, their, predecessors, both, made, arrangements, of, folk, songs, and, incorporated, traditional, material, into, original, classical, compositions, the, advent, of, audio, recording, technology, provided, folklorists, with, a, revolutionary, tool, to, preserve, vanishing, musical, forms, the, earliest, american, folk, music, scholars, were, with, the, american, folklore, society, afs, which, emerged, in, the, late, 1800s, their, studies, expanded, to, include, native, american, music, but, still, treated, folk, music, as, a, historical, item, preserved, in, isolated, societies, as, well, in, north, america, during, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, the, library, of, congress, worked, through, the, offices, of, traditional, music, collectors, robert, winslow, gordon, alan, lomax, and, others, to, capture, as, much, north, american, field, material, as, possible, john, lomax, the, father, of, alan, lomax, was, the, first, prominent, scholar, to, study, distinctly, american, folk, music, such, as, that, of, cowboys, and, southern, blacks, his, first, major, published, work, was, in, 1911, cowboy, songs, and, other, frontier, ballads, and, was, arguably, the, most, prominent, us, folk, music, scholar, of, his, time, notably, during, the, beginnings, of, the, folk, music, revival, in, the, 1930s, and, early, 1940s, cecil, sharp, also, worked, in, america, recording, the, traditional, songs, of, the, appalachian, mountains, in, 1916, 1918, in, collaboration, with, maud, karpeles, and, olive, dame, campbell, and, is, considered, the, first, major, scholar, covering, american, folk, music, campbell, and, sharp, are, represented, under, other, names, by, actors, in, the, modern, movie, songcatcher, one, strong, theme, amongst, folk, scholars, in, the, early, decades, of, the, 20th, century, was, regionalism, the, analysis, of, the, diversity, of, folk, music, and, related, cultures, based, on, regions, of, the, us, rather, than, based, on, a, given, song, s, historical, roots, later, a, dynamic, of, class, and, circumstances, was, added, to, this, the, most, prominent, regionalists, were, literary, figures, with, a, particular, interest, in, folklore, carl, sandburg, often, traveled, the, u, s, as, a, writer, and, a, poet, he, also, collected, songs, in, his, travels, and, in, 1927, published, them, in, the, book, the, american, songbag, rachel, donaldson, a, historian, who, worked, for, vanderbilt, later, stated, this, about, the, american, songbird, in, her, analysis, of, the, folk, music, revival, in, his, collections, of, folk, songs, sandburg, added, a, class, dynamic, to, popular, understandings, of, american, folk, music, this, was, the, final, element, of, the, foundation, upon, which, the, early, folk, music, revivalists, constructed, their, own, view, of, americanism, sandburg, s, working, class, americans, joined, with, the, ethnically, racially, and, regionally, diverse, citizens, that, other, scholars, public, intellectuals, and, folklorists, celebrated, their, own, definitions, of, the, american, folk, definitions, that, the, folk, revivalists, used, in, constructing, their, own, understanding, of, american, folk, music, and, an, overarching, american, identity, prior, to, the, 1930s, the, study, of, folk, music, was, primarily, the, province, of, scholars, and, collectors, the, 1930s, saw, the, beginnings, of, larger, scale, themes, commonalities, and, linkages, in, folk, music, developing, in, the, populace, and, practitioners, as, well, often, related, to, the, great, depression, regionalism, and, cultural, pluralism, grew, as, influences, and, themes, during, this, time, folk, music, began, to, become, enmeshed, with, political, and, social, activism, themes, and, movements, two, related, developments, were, the, u, s, communist, party, s, interest, in, folk, music, as, a, way, to, reach, and, influence, americans, and, politically, active, prominent, folk, musicians, and, scholars, seeing, communism, as, a, possible, better, system, through, the, lens, of, the, great, depression, woody, guthrie, exemplifies, songwriters, and, artists, with, such, an, outlook, folk, music, festivals, proliferated, during, the, 1930s, president, franklin, roosevelt, was, a, fan, of, folk, music, hosted, folk, concerts, at, the, white, house, and, often, patronized, folk, festivals, one, prominent, festival, was, sarah, gertrude, knott, s, national, folk, festival, established, in, st, louis, missouri, in, 1934, under, the, sponsorship, of, the, washington, post, the, festival, was, held, in, washington, dc, at, constitution, hall, from, 1937, to, 1942, the, folk, music, movement, festivals, and, the, wartime, effort, were, seen, as, forces, for, social, goods, such, as, democracy, cultural, pluralism, and, the, removal, of, culture, and, race, based, barriers, the, american, folk, music, revivalists, of, the, 1930s, approached, folk, music, in, different, ways, three, primary, schools, of, thought, emerged, traditionalists, e, g, sarah, gertrude, knott, and, john, lomax, emphasized, the, preservation, of, songs, as, artifacts, of, deceased, cultures, functional, folklorists, e, g, botkin, and, alan, lomax, maintained, that, songs, only, retain, relevance, when, used, by, those, cultures, which, retain, the, traditions, which, birthed, those, songs, left, wing, folk, revivalists, e, g, charles, seeger, and, lawrence, gellert, emphasized, music, s, role, in, people, s, struggles, for, social, and, political, rights, by, the, end, of, the, 1930s, these, and, others, had, turned, american, folk, music, into, a, social, movement, sometimes, folk, musicians, became, scholars, and, advocates, themselves, for, example, jean, ritchie, 1922, 2015, was, the, youngest, child, of, a, large, family, from, viper, kentucky, that, had, preserved, many, of, the, old, appalachian, traditional, songs, ritchie, living, in, a, time, when, the, appalachians, had, opened, up, to, outside, influence, was, university, educated, and, ultimately, moved, to, new, york, city, where, she, made, a, number, of, classic, recordings, of, the, family, repertoire, and, published, an, important, compilation, of, these, songs, in, january, 2012, the, american, folklife, center, at, the, library, of, congress, with, the, association, for, cultural, equity, announced, that, they, would, release, lomax, s, vast, archive, of, 1946, and, later, recording, in, digital, form, lomax, spent, the, last, 20, years, of, his, life, working, on, an, interactive, multimedia, educational, computer, project, he, called, the, global, jukebox, which, included, 5, 000, hours, of, sound, recordings, 400, 000, feet, of, film, 3, 000, videotapes, and, 5, 000, photographs, as, of, march, 2012, this, has, been, accomplished, approximately, 17, 400, of, lomax, s, recordings, from, 1946, and, later, have, been, made, available, free, online, this, material, from, alan, lomax, s, independent, archive, begun, in, 1946, which, has, been, digitized, and, offered, by, the, association, for, cultural, equity, is, distinct, from, the, thousands, of, earlier, recordings, on, acetate, and, aluminum, discs, he, made, from, 1933, to, 1942, under, the, auspices, of, the, library, of, congress, this, earlier, collection, which, includes, the, famous, jelly, roll, morton, woody, guthrie,
