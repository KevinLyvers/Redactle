in, music, counterpoint, is, a, method, of, composition, in, which, two, or, more, musical, lines, or, voices, are, simultaneously, played, which, are, harmonically, correlated, yet, independent, in, rhythm, and, melodic, contour, it, has, been, most, commonly, identified, in, the, european, classical, tradition, strongly, developing, during, the, renaissance, and, in, much, of, the, common, practice, period, especially, in, the, baroque, period, the, term, originates, from, the, latin, punctus, contra, punctum, meaning, point, against, point, i, e, note, against, note, in, western, pedagogy, counterpoint, is, taught, through, a, system, of, species, see, below, there, are, several, different, forms, of, counterpoint, including, imitative, counterpoint, and, free, counterpoint, imitative, counterpoint, involves, the, repetition, of, a, main, melodic, idea, across, different, vocal, parts, with, or, without, variation, compositions, written, in, free, counterpoint, often, incorporate, non, traditional, harmonies, and, chords, chromaticism, and, dissonance, the, term, counterpoint, has, been, used, to, designate, a, voice, or, even, an, entire, composition, counterpoint, focuses, on, melodic, interaction, only, secondarily, on, the, harmonies, produced, by, that, interaction, in, the, words, of, john, rahn, it, is, hard, to, write, a, beautiful, song, it, is, harder, to, write, several, individually, beautiful, songs, that, when, sung, simultaneously, sound, as, a, more, beautiful, polyphonic, whole, the, internal, structures, that, create, each, of, the, voices, separately, must, contribute, to, the, emergent, structure, of, the, polyphony, which, in, turn, must, reinforce, and, comment, on, the, structures, of, the, individual, voices, the, way, that, is, accomplished, in, detail, is, counterpoint, work, initiated, by, guerino, mazzola, born, 1947, has, given, counterpoint, theory, a, mathematical, foundation, in, particular, mazzola, s, model, gives, a, structural, and, not, psychological, foundation, of, forbidden, parallels, of, fifths, and, the, dissonant, fourth, octavio, agustin, has, extended, the, model, to, microtonal, contexts, another, theorist, who, has, tried, to, incorporate, mathematical, principles, in, his, study, of, counterpoint, is, sergei, taneyev, 1856, 1915, inspired, by, spinoza, taneyev, developed, a, theory, which, covers, and, generalizes, a, wide, range, of, advanced, contrapuntal, phenomena, including, what, is, known, to, the, english, speaking, theorists, as, invertible, counterpoint, although, he, describes, them, mainly, using, his, own, custom, built, terminology, by, means, of, linking, them, to, simple, algebraic, procedures, in, counterpoint, the, functional, independence, of, voices, is, the, prime, concern, the, violation, of, this, principle, leads, to, special, effects, which, are, avoided, in, counterpoint, in, organ, registers, certain, interval, combinations, and, chords, are, activated, by, a, single, key, so, that, playing, a, melody, results, in, parallel, voice, leading, these, voices, losing, independence, are, fused, into, one, and, the, parallel, chords, are, perceived, as, single, tones, with, a, new, timbre, this, effect, is, also, used, in, orchestral, arrangements, for, instance, in, ravel, s, bolero, 5, the, parallel, parts, of, flutes, horn, and, celesta, resemble, the, sound, of, an, electric, organ, in, counterpoint, parallel, voices, are, prohibited, because, they, violate, the, homogeneity, of, musical, texture, when, independent, voices, occasionally, disappear, turning, into, a, new, timbre, quality, and, vice, versa, some, examples, of, related, compositional, techniques, include, the, round, familiar, in, folk, traditions, the, canon, and, perhaps, the, most, complex, contrapuntal, convention, the, fugue, all, of, these, are, examples, of, imitative, counterpoint, there, are, many, examples, of, song, melodies, that, are, harmonically, interdependent, yet, independent, in, rhythm, and, melodic, contour, for, example, fr, re, jacques, and, three, blind, mice, combine, euphoniously, when, sung, together, a, number, of, popular, songs, that, share, the, same, chord, progression, can, also, be, sung, together, as, counterpoint, a, well, known, pair, of, examples, is, my, way, combined, with, life, on, mars, johann, sebastian, bach, is, revered, as, one, of, the, greatest, masters, of, counterpoint, for, example, the, harmony, implied, in, the, opening, subject, of, the, fugue, in, g, sharp, minor, from, book, ii, of, the, well, tempered, clavier, is, heard, anew, in, a, subtle, way, when, a, second, voice, is, added, the, counterpoint, in, bars, 5, 8, sheds, an, unexpected, light, on, the, tonality, of, the, subject, bach, s, 3, part, invention, in, f, minor, combines, three, independent, melodies, according, to, pianist, andr, s, schiff, bach, s, counterpoint, influenced, the, composing, of, both, mozart, and, beethoven, in, the, development, section, of, the, opening, movement, of, beethoven, s, piano, sonata, in, e, minor, beethoven, demonstrates, this, influence, by, adding, a, wonderful, counterpoint, to, one, of, the, main, themes, a, further, example, of, fluid, counterpoint, in, late, beethoven, may, be, found, in, the, first, orchestral, variation, on, the, ode, to, joy, theme, in, the, last, movement, of, beethoven, s, symphony, no, 9, bars, 116, 123, the, famous, theme, is, heard, on, the, violas, and, cellos, while, the, basses, add, a, bass, line, whose, sheer, unpredictability, gives, the, impression, that, it, is, being, spontaneously, improvised, meantime, a, solo, bassoon, adds, a, counterpoint, that, has, a, similarly, impromptu, quality, in, the, prelude, to, richard, wagner, s, opera, die, meistersinger, von, n, rnberg, three, themes, from, the, opera, are, combined, simultaneously, according, to, gordon, jacob, this, is, universally, and, justly, acclaimed, as, an, extraordinary, feat, of, virtuosity, however, donald, tovey, points, out, that, here, the, combination, of, themes, unlike, classical, counterpoint, really, do, not, of, themselves, combine, into, complete, or, euphonious, harmony, one, spectacular, example, of, 5, voice, counterpoint, can, be, found, in, the, finale, to, mozart, s, symphony, no, 41, jupiter, symphony, here, five, tunes, combine, simultaneously, in, a, rich, tapestry, of, dialogue, see, also, invertible, counterpoint, species, counterpoint, was, developed, as, a, pedagogical, tool, in, which, students, progress, through, several, species, of, increasing, complexity, with, a, very, simple, part, that, remains, constant, known, as, the, cantus, firmus, latin, for, fixed, melody, species, counterpoint, generally, offers, less, freedom, to, the, composer, than, other, types, of, counterpoint, and, therefore, is, called, a, strict, counterpoint, the, student, gradually, attains, the, ability, to, write, free, counterpoint, that, is, less, rigorously, constrained, counterpoint, usually, without, a, cantus, firmus, according, to, the, given, rules, at, the, time, the, idea, is, at, least, as, old, as, 1532, when, giovanni, maria, lanfranco, described, a, similar, concept, in, his, scintille, di, musica, brescia, 1533, the, 16th, century, venetian, theorist, zarlino, elaborated, on, the, idea, in, his, influential, le, institutioni, harmoniche, and, it, was, first, presented, in, a, codified, form, in, 1619, by, lodovico, zacconi, in, his, prattica, di, musica, zacconi, unlike, later, theorists, included, a, few, extra, contrapuntal, techniques, such, as, invertible, counterpoint, in, 1725, johann, joseph, fux, published, gradus, ad, parnassum, steps, to, parnassus, in, which, he, described, five, species, a, succession, of, later, theorists, quite, closely, imitated, fux, s, seminal, work, often, with, some, small, and, idiosyncratic, modifications, in, the, rules, many, of, fux, s, rules, concerning, the, purely, linear, construction, of, melodies, have, their, origin, in, solfeggi, concerning, the, common, practice, era, alterations, to, the, melodic, rules, were, introduced, to, enable, the, function, of, certain, harmonic, forms, the, combination, of, these, melodies, produced, the, basic, harmonic, structure, the, figured, bass, the, following, rules, apply, to, melodic, writing, in, each, species, for, each, part, and, in, all, species, the, following, rules, govern, the, combination, of, the, parts, in, first, species, counterpoint, each, note, in, every, added, part, parts, being, also, referred, to, as, lines, or, voices, sounds, against, one, note, in, the, cantus, firmus, notes, in, all, parts, are, sounded, simultaneously, and, move, against, each, other, simultaneously, since, all, notes, in, first, species, counterpoint, are, whole, notes, rhythmic, independence, is, not, available, in, the, present, context, a, step, is, a, melodic, interval, of, a, half, or, whole, step, a, skip, is, an, interval, of, a, third, or, fourth, see, steps, and, skips, an, interval, of, a, fifth, or, larger, is, referred, to, as, a, leap, a, few, further, rules, given, by, fux, by, study, of, the, palestrina, style, and, usually, given, in, the, works, of, later, counterpoint, pedagogues, are, as, follows, in, the, adjacent, example, in, two, parts, the, cantus, firmus, is, the, lower, part, the, same, cantus, firmus, is, used, for, later, examples, also, each, is, in, the, dorian, mode, in, second, species, counterpoint, two, notes, in, each, of, the, added, parts, work, against, each, longer, note, in, the, given, part, additional, considerations, in, second, species, counterpoint, are, as, follows, and, are, in, addition, to, the, considerations, for, first, species, in, third, species, counterpoint, four, or, three, etc, notes, move, against, each, longer, note, in, the, given, part, three, special, figures, are, introduced, into, third, species, and, later, added, to, fifth, species, and, ultimately, outside, the, restrictions, of, species, writing, there, are, three, figures, to, consider, the, nota, cambiata, double, neighbor, tones, and, double, passing, tones, double, neighbor, tones, the, figure, is, prolonged, over, four, beats, and, allows, special, dissonances, the, upper, and, lower, tones, are, prepared, on, beat, 1, and, resolved, on, beat, 4, the, fifth, note, or, downbeat, of, the, next, measure, should, move, by, step, in, the, same, direction, as, the, last, two, notes, of, the, double, neighbor, figure, lastly, a, double, passing, tone, allows, two, dissonant, passing, tones, in, a, row, the, figure, would, consist, of, 4, notes, moving, in, the, same, direction, by, step, the, two, notes, that, allow, dissonance, would, be, beat, 2, and, 3, or, 3, and, 4, the, dissonant, interval, of, a, fourth, would, proceed, into, a, diminished, fifth, and, the, next, note, would, resolve, at, the, interval, of, a, sixth, in, fourth, species, counterpoint, some, notes, are, sustained, or, suspended, in, an, added, part, while, notes, move, against, them, in, the, given, part, often, creating, a, dissonance, on, the, beat, followed, by, the, suspended, note, then, changing, and, catching, up, to, create, a, subsequent, consonance, with, the, note, in, the, given, part, as, it, continues, to, sound, as, before, fourth, species, counterpoint, is, called, expanded, when, the, added, part, notes, vary, in, length, among, themselves, the, technique, requires, chains, of, notes, sustained, across, the, boundaries, determined, by, beat, and, so, creates, syncopation, a, dissonant, interval, is, allowed, on, beat, 1, because, of, the, syncopation, created, by, the, suspension, while, it, is, not, incorrect, to, start, with, a, half, note, it, is, also, common, to, start, 4th, species, with, a, half, rest, short, example, of, fourth, species, counterpoint, in, fifth, species, counterpoint, sometimes, called, florid, counterpoint, the, other, four, species, of, counterpoint, are, combined, within, the, added, parts, in, the, example, the, first, and, second, bars, are, second, species, the, third, bar, is, third, species, the, fourth, and, fifth, bars, are, third, and, embellished, fourth, species, and, the, final, bar, is, first, species, in, florid, counterpoint, it, is, important, that, no, one, species, dominates, the, composition, short, example, of, florid, counterpoint, since, the, renaissance, period, in, european, music, much, contrapuntal, music, has, been, written, in, imitative, counterpoint, in, imitative, counterpoint, two, or, more, voices, enter, at, different, times, and, especially, when, entering, each, voice, repeats, some, version, of, the, same, melodic, element, the, fantasia, the, ricercar, and, later, the, canon, and, fugue, the, contrapuntal, form, par, excellence, all, feature, imitative, counterpoint, which, also, frequently, appears, in, choral, works, such, as, motets, and, madrigals, imitative, counterpoint, spawned, a, number, of, devices, including, broadly, speaking, due, to, the, development, of, harmony, from, the, baroque, period, on, most, contrapuntal, compositions, were, written, in, the, style, of, free, counterpoint, this, means, that, the, general, focus, of, the, composer, had, shifted, away, from, how, the, intervals, of, added, melodies, related, to, a, cantus, firmus, and, more, toward, how, they, related, to, each, other, nonetheless, according, to, kent, kennan, actual, teaching, in, that, fashion, free, counterpoint, did, not, become, widespread, until, the, late, nineteenth, century, young, composers, of, the, eighteenth, and, nineteenth, centuries, such, as, mozart, beethoven, and, schumann, were, still, educated, in, the, style, of, strict, counterpoint, but, in, practice, they, would, look, for, ways, to, expand, on, the, traditional, concepts, of, the, subject, main, features, of, free, counterpoint, linear, counterpoint, is, a, purely, horizontal, technique, in, which, the, integrity, of, the, individual, melodic, lines, is, not, sacrificed, to, harmonic, considerations, its, distinctive, feature, is, rather, the, concept, of, melody, which, served, as, the, starting, point, for, the, adherents, of, the, new, objectivity, when, they, set, up, linear, counterpoint, as, an, anti, type, to, the, romantic, harmony, the, voice, parts, move, freely, irrespective, of, the, effects, their, combined, motions, may, create, in, other, words, either, the, domination, of, the, horizontal, linear, aspects, over, the, vertical, is, featured, or, the, harmonic, control, of, lines, is, rejected, associated, with, neoclassicism, the, technique, was, first, used, in, igor, stravinsky, s, octet, 1923, inspired, by, j, s, bach, and, giovanni, palestrina, however, according, to, knud, jeppesen, bach, s, and, palestrina, s, points, of, departure, are, antipodal, palestrina, starts, out, from, lines, and, arrives, at, chords, bach, s, music, grows, out, of, an, ideally, harmonic, background, against, which, the, voices, develop, with, a, bold, independence, that, is, often, breath, taking, according, to, cunningham, linear, harmony, is, a, frequent, approach, in, the, 20th, century, are, combined, with, almost, careless, abandon, in, the, hopes, that, new, chords, and, progressions, will, result, it, is, possible, with, any, kind, of, line, diatonic, or, duodecuple, dissonant, counterpoint, was, originally, theorized, by, charles, seeger, as, at, first, purely, a, school, room, discipline, consisting, of, species, counterpoint, but, with, all, the, traditional, rules, reversed, first, species, counterpoint, must, be, all, dissonances, establishing, dissonance, rather, than, consonance, as, the, rule, and, consonances, are, resolved, through, a, skip, not, step, he, wrote, that, the, effect, of, this, discipline, was, one, of, purification, other, aspects, of, composition, such, as, rhythm, could, be, dissonated, by, applying, the, same, principle, seeger, was, not, the, first, to, employ, dissonant, counterpoint, but, was, the, first, to, theorize, and, promote, it, other, composers, who, have, used, dissonant, counterpoint, if, not, in, the, exact, manner, prescribed, by, charles, seeger, include, johanna, beyer, john, cage, ruth, crawford, seeger, vivian, fine, carl, ruggles, henry, cowell, carlos, ch, vez, john, j, becker, henry, brant, lou, harrison, wallingford, riegger, and, frank, wigglesworth, sources
