times, and, this, came, to, be, the, title, by, which, the, film, was, known, in, english, when, the, film, was, re, released, in, the, late, 1990s, san, francisco, chronicle, film, critic, bob, graham, said, that, he, preferred, that, version, stating, purists, have, criticized, the, english, title, of, the, film, as, a, poor, translation, of, the, italian, ladri, which, is, plural, what, blindness, the, bicycle, thief, is, one, of, those, wonderful, titles, whose, power, does, not, sink, in, until, the, film, is, over, the, 2007, criterion, collection, release, in, north, america,

aristarco, praised, it, but, also, complained, that, sentimentality, might, at, times, take, the, place, of, artistic, emotion, fellow, italian, neorealist, film, director, luchino, visconti, criticized, the, film, saying, that, it, was, a, mistake, to, use, a, professional, actor, to, dub, over, lamberto, maggiorani, s, dialogue, luigi, bartolini, the, author, of, the, novel, from, which, de, sica, drew, his, title, was, highly, critical, of, the, film, feeling, that, the, spirit, of, his, book, had, been, thoroughly, betrayed, because, his, protagonist, was, a, middle, class, intellectual, and, his, theme, was, the, breakdown, of, civil, order, contemporary, reviews, elsewhere, were, positive, bosley, crowther, film, critic, for, the, new, york, times, lauded, the, film, and, its, message, in, his, review, he, wrote, again, the, italians, have, sent, us, a, brilliant, and, devastating, film, in, vittorio, de, sica, s, rueful, drama, of, modern, city, life, the, bicycle, thief, widely, and, fervently, heralded, by, those, who, had, seen, it, abroad, where, it, already, has, won, several, prizes, at, various, film, festivals, this, heart, tearing, picture, of, frustration, which, came, to, yesterday, bids, fair, to, fulfill, all, the, forecasts, of, its, absolute, triumph, over, here, for, once, more, the, talented, de, sica, who, gave, us, the, shattering, shoeshine, that, desperately, tragic, demonstration, of, juvenile, corruption, in, post, war, rome, has, laid, hold, upon, and, sharply, imaged, in, simple, and, realistic, terms, a, major, indeed, a, fundamental, and, universal, dramatic, theme, it, is, the, isolation, and, loneliness, of, the, little, man, in, this, complex, social, world, that, is, ironically, blessed, with, institutions, to, comfort, and, protect, mankind, pierre, leprohon, wrote, in, cin, ma, d, aujourd, hui, that, what, must, not, be, ignored, on, the, social, level, is, that, the, character, is, shown, not, at, the, beginning, of, a, crisis, but, at, its, outcome, one, need, only, to, look, at, his, face, his, uncertain, gait, his, hesitant, or, fearful, attitudes, to, understand, that, ricci, is, already, a, victim, a, diminished, man, who, has, lost, his, confidence, then, paris, based, lotte, h, eisner, called, it, the, best, italian, film, since, world, war, ii, and, uk, critic, robert, winnington,

appears, to, be, a, miniature, man, they, bring, a, grave, dignity, to, de, sica, s, unblinking, view, of, post, war, italy, the, wheel, of, life, turns, and, grinds, people, down, the, man, who, was, riding, high, in, the, morning, is, brought, low, by, nightfall, it, is, impossible, to, imagine, this, story, in, any, other, form, than, de, sica, s, the, new, black, and, white, print, has, an,
