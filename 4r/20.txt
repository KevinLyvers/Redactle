mesoamerican, architecture, is, the, set, of, architectural, traditions, produced, by, pre, columbian, cultures, and, civilizations, of, mesoamerica, traditions, which, are, best, known, in, the, form, of, public, ceremonial, and, urban, monumental, buildings, and, structures, the, distinctive, features, of, mesoamerican, architecture, encompass, a, number, of, different, regional, and, historical, styles, which, however, are, significantly, interrelated, these, styles, developed, throughout, the, different, phases, of, mesoamerican, history, as, a, result, of, the, intensive, cultural, exchange, between, the, different, cultures, of, the, mesoamerican, culture, area, through, thousands, of, years, mesoamerican, architecture, is, mostly, noted, for, its, pyramids, which, are, the, largest, such, structures, outside, of, ancient, egypt, one, interesting, and, widely, researched, topic, is, the, relation, between, cosmovision, religion, geography, and, architecture, in, mesoamerica, much, seems, to, suggest, that, many, traits, of, mesoamerican, architecture, were, governed, by, religious, and, mythological, ideas, for, example, the, layout, of, most, mesoamerican, cities, seem, to, be, influenced, by, the, cardinal, directions, and, their, mythological, and, symbolic, meanings, in, mesoamerican, culture, another, part, of, mesoamerican, architecture, is, its, iconography, the, monumental, architecture, of, mesoamerica, was, decorated, with, images, of, religious, and, cultural, significance, and, also, in, many, cases, with, writing, in, some, of, the, mesoamerican, writing, systems, iconographic, decorations, and, texts, on, buildings, are, important, contributors, to, the, overall, current, knowledge, of, pre, columbian, mesoamerican, society, history, and, religion, the, following, tables, show, the, different, phases, of, mesoamerican, architecture, and, archeology, and, correlates, them, with, the, cultures, cities, styles, and, specific, buildings, that, are, notable, from, each, period, an, important, part, of, the, mesoamerican, religious, system, was, replicating, their, beliefs, in, concrete, tangible, forms, in, effect, making, the, world, an, embodiment, of, their, beliefs, this, meant, that, the, mesoamerican, city, was, constructed, to, be, a, microcosm, manifesting, the, same, division, that, existed, in, the, religious, mythical, geography, a, division, between, the, underworld, and, the, human, world, the, underworld, was, represented, by, the, direction, north, and, many, structures, and, buildings, related, to, the, underworld, such, as, tombs, are, often, found, in, the, city, s, northern, half, the, southern, part, represented, life, sustenance, and, rebirth, and, often, contained, structures, related, to, the, continuity, and, daily, function, of, the, city, state, such, as, monuments, depicting, the, noble, lineages, or, residential, quarters, markets, etc, between, the, two, halves, of, the, north, south, axis, was, the, plaza, often, containing, stelae, resembling, the, world, tree, the, mesoamerican, axis, mundi, and, a, ballcourt, which, served, as, a, crossing, point, between, the, two, worlds, some, mesoamericanists, argue, that, in, religious, symbolism, the, mesoamerican, monumental, architecture, pyramids, were, mountains, stelae, were, trees, and, wells, ballcourts, and, cenotes, were, caves, that, provided, access, to, the, underworld, mesoamerican, architecture, is, often, designed, to, align, to, specific, celestial, events, some, pyramids, temples, and, other, structures, were, designed, to, achieve, special, lighting, effects, on, particular, days, important, in, the, mesoamerican, cosmovision, a, famous, example, is, the, el, castillo, pyramid, at, chichen, itza, where, a, light, and, shadow, effect, can, be, observed, during, several, weeks, around, the, equinoxes, contrary, to, a, common, opinion, however, there, is, no, evidence, that, this, phenomenon, was, the, result, of, a, purposeful, design, intended, to, commemorate, the, equinoxes, much, mesoamerican, architecture, is, also, aligned, to, roughly, 15, east, of, north, vincent, h, malmstrom, has, argued, that, this, is, because, of, a, general, wish, to, align, the, pyramids, to, face, the, sunset, on, august, 13, which, was, the, beginning, date, of, the, maya, long, count, calendar, however, recent, research, has, shown, that, the, earliest, orientations, marking, sunsets, on, august, 13, and, april, 30, occur, outside, of, the, maya, area, their, purpose, must, have, been, to, record, the, dates, separated, by, a, period, of, 260, days, from, august, 13, to, april, 30, equivalent, to, the, length, of, the, sacred, mesoamerican, calendrical, count, in, general, the, orientations, in, mesoamerican, architecture, tend, to, mark, the, dates, separated, by, multiples, of, 13, and, 20, days, i, e, of, basic, periods, of, the, calendrical, system, the, distribution, of, these, dates, in, the, year, suggests, that, the, orientations, allowed, the, use, of, observational, calendars, that, facilitated, the, prediction, of, agriculturally, significant, dates, these, conclusions, are, supported, by, the, results, of, systematic, research, accomplished, in, various, mesoamerican, regions, including, central, mexico, the, maya, lowlands, oaxaca, the, gulf, coast, lowlands, and, western, and, northern, mesoamerica, while, solar, orientations, prevail, some, prominent, buildings, were, aligned, to, venus, extremes, a, notable, example, being, the, governor, s, palace, at, uxmal, orientations, to, lunar, standstill, positions, on, the, horizon, have, also, been, documented, they, are, particularly, common, along, the, northeast, coast, of, the, yucat, n, peninsula, where, the, worship, of, the, goddess, ixchel, associated, with, the, moon, is, known, to, have, had, an, outstanding, importance, during, the, postclassic, period, nearly, every, known, ancient, mesoamerican, city, had, one, or, more, formal, public, plazas, they, are, typically, large, impressive, spaces, surrounded, by, tall, pyramids, temples, and, other, important, buildings, activities, that, would, take, place, in, these, plazas, would, include, private, rituals, periodic, markets, mass, spectator, ceremonies, participatory, public, ceremonies, feasts, and, other, popular, celebrations, the, size, of, the, main, plazas, in, mesoamerican, cities, differed, greatly, the, largest, being, located, in, tenochtitlan, with, an, estimated, size, of, 115, 000, square, meters, this, plaza, is, an, outlier, due, to, the, population, of, the, city, being, so, large, the, next, largest, estimated, plaza, is, located, in, the, gulf, coast, in, the, city, of, cempoala, or, zempoala, measuring, at, 48, 088, square, meters, most, plazas, average, at, around, 3, 000, square, meters, the, smallest, being, at, the, site, of, paxte, which, is, 528, square, meters, some, cities, contain, many, smaller, plazas, throughout, while, some, focus, their, attention, on, a, significantly, large, main, plaza, tenochtitlan, was, an, aztec, city, that, thrived, from, 1325, to, 1521, the, city, was, built, on, an, island, surrounded, on, all, sides, by, lake, texcoco, it, consisted, of, an, elaborate, system, of, canals, aqueducts, and, causeways, allowing, the, city, to, supply, its, residents, the, island, was, about, 12, square, kilometers, and, had, a, population, of, approximately, 125, 000, people, making, it, the, largest, mesoamerican, city, ever, recorded, the, main, plaza, of, tenochtitlan, was, approximately, 115, 000, square, meters, or, 11, 5, ha, 28, acres, the, main, temple, of, tenochtitlan, known, as, templo, mayor, or, the, great, temple, was, 100, meters, by, 80, meters, at, its, base, and, 60, meters, tall, the, city, ultimately, fell, in, 1521, when, it, was, destroyed, by, the, spanish, conquistador, hern, n, cort, s, in, 1521, cort, s, and, the, spaniards, raided, the, city, for, its, gold, supply, and, artifacts, leaving, little, behind, of, the, aztec, s, civilization, at, the, monumental, templo, mayor, of, tenochtitlan, archaeologists, discovered, that, the, aztec, enlarged, the, temple, seven, times, with, five, extra, fa, ades, but, always, kept, intact, the, basic, dual, symbolism, of, the, rain, god, tlaloc, and, the, tribute, war, god, huitzilopochtli, mexican, archaeologist, eduardo, matos, moctezuma, has, shown, that, the, symbolic, and, ritual, life, of, this, imperial, shrine, unified, the, patterns, of, forced, tributary, payments, from, hundreds, of, communities, with, the, agricultural, and, hydraulic, subsystems, of, food, production, often, the, most, important, religious, temples, sat, atop, the, towering, pyramids, presumably, as, the, closest, place, to, the, heavens, while, recent, discoveries, point, toward, the, extensive, use, of, pyramids, as, tombs, the, temples, themselves, seem, to, rarely, if, ever, contain, burials, residing, atop, the, pyramids, some, of, over, two, hundred, feet, such, as, that, at, el, mirador, the, temples, were, impressive, and, decorated, structures, themselves, commonly, topped, with, a, roof, comb, or, superficial, grandiose, wall, these, temples, might, have, served, as, a, type, of, propaganda, the, pyramid, of, the, sun, is, the, largest, structure, created, in, the, city, of, teotihuacan, and, one, of, the, largest, structures, in, the, entire, western, hemisphere, it, stands, at, about, 216, feet, and, is, roughly, 720, by, 760, ft, 220, by, 230, m, at, its, base, the, pyramid, is, located, on, the, east, side, of, the, avenue, of, the, dead, which, runs, almost, directly, down, the, center, of, the, city, of, teotihuacan, after, archaeologists, discovered, animal, remains, masks, figurines, specifically, one, of, the, aztec, god, huehueteotl, and, shards, of, clay, pots, in, the, pyramid, it, was, agreed, upon, that, the, pyramid, was, likely, a, ritual, temple, at, one, point, the, temple, of, the, feathered, serpent, was, constructed, after, the, pyramid, of, the, sun, and, the, pyramid, of, the, moon, had, been, completed, the, temple, marks, one, of, the, first, uses, of, the, architecture, style, of, talud, tablero, on, the, surfaces, the, temple, had, murals, illustrated, on, them, just, like, so, many, temples, that, were, built, at, the, same, time, and, by, the, same, people, the, tableros, featured, large, serpent, heads, complete, with, elaborate, headdresses, the, feathered, serpent, refers, to, the, aztec, god, quetzalcoatl, the, mesoamerican, ballgame, ritual, was, a, symbolic, journey, between, the, underworld, and, the, world, of, the, living, and, many, ball, courts, are, found, in, the, mid, part, of, the, city, functioning, as, a, connection, between, the, northern, and, southern, halves, of, the, city, all, but, the, earliest, ball, courts, are, masonry, structures, over, 1300, ball, courts, have, been, identified, and, although, there, is, a, tremendous, variation, in, size, they, all, have, the, same, general, shape, a, long, narrow, alley, flanked, by, two, walls, with, horizontal, sloping, and, sometimes, vertical, faces, the, later, vertical, faces, such, as, those, at, chichen, itza, and, el, tajin, are, often, covered, with, complex, iconography, and, scenes, of, human, sacrifice, although, the, alleys, in, early, ball, courts, were, open, ended, later, ball, courts, had, enclosed, end, zones, giving, the, structure, an, shape, when, viewed, from, above, the, playing, alley, may, be, at, ground, level, or, the, ball, court, may, be, sunken, ball, courts, were, no, mean, feats, of, engineering, one, of, the, sandstone, stones, on, el, tajin, s, south, ball, court, is, 11, m, long, and, weighs, more, than, 10, tons, large, and, often, highly, decorated, the, palaces, usually, sat, close, to, the, center, of, a, city, and, housed, the, population, s, elite, any, exceedingly, large, royal, palace, or, one, consisting, of, many, chambers, on, different, levels, might, be, referred, to, as, an, acropolis, however, often, these, were, one, story, and, consisted, of, many, small, chambers, and, typically, at, least, one, interior, courtyard, these, structures, appear, to, take, into, account, the, needed, functionality, required, of, a, residence, as, well, as, the, decoration, required, for, their, inhabitants, stature, archaeologists, seem, to, agree, that, many, palaces, are, home, to, various, tombs, at, cop, n, beneath, over, four, hundred, years, of, later, remodeling, a, tomb, for, one, of, the, ancient, rulers, has, been, discovered, and, the, north, acropolis, at, tikal, appears, to, have, been, the, site, of, numerous, burials, during, the, terminal, pre, classic, and, early, classic, periods, the, most, surprising, aspect, of, the, great, mesoamerican, structures, is, their, lack, of, many, advanced, technologies, that, would, seem, to, be, necessary, for, such, constructions, lacking, metal, tools, mesoamerican, architecture, required, one, thing, in, abundance, manpower, yet, beyond, this, enormous, requirement, the, remaining, materials, seem, to, have, been, readily, available, they, most, often, utilized, limestone, which, remained, pliable, enough, to, be, worked, with, stone, tools, while, being, quarried, and, only, hardened, once, when, removed, from, its, bed, in, addition, to, the, structural, use, of, limestone, much, of, their, mortar, consisted, of, crushed, burnt, and, mixed, limestone, that, mimicked, the, properties, of, cement, and, was, used, just, as, widely, for, stucco, finishing, as, it, was, for, mortar, however, later, improvements, in, quarrying, techniques, reduced, the, necessity, for, this, limestone, stucco, as, their, stones, began, to, fit, quite, perfectly, yet, it, remained, a, crucial, element, in, some, post, and, lintel, roofs, a, common, building, material, in, central, mexico, was, tezontle, a, light, volcanic, rock, it, was, common, for, palaces, and, monumental, structures, to, be, made, of, this, rough, stone, and, then, covered, with, stucco, or, with, a, cantera, veneer, very, large, and, ornate, architectural, ornaments, were, fashioned, from, a, very, enduring, stucco, kalk, especially, in, the, maya, region, where, a, type, of, hydraulic, limestone, cement, or, concrete, was, also, used, in, the, case, of, the, common, houses, wooden, framing, adobe, and, thatch, were, used, to, build, homes, over, stone, foundations, however, instances, of, what, appear, to, be, common, houses, of, limestone, have, been, discovered, as, well, buildings, were, typically, finished, with, high, slanted, roofs, usually, built, of, wood, or, thatch, although, stone, roofs, in, these, high, slant, fashions, are, also, used, rarely, an, architectural, construction, technique, that, employs, large, dry, laid, limestone, blocks, c, 1, m, 50, cm, 30, cm, covered, with, a, thick, layer, of, stucco, this, style, was, common, in, the, northern, maya, lowlands, from, the, preclassic, until, the, early, parts, of, the, early, classic, pyramids, in, mesoamerican, were, platformed, pyramids, and, many, used, a, style, called, talud, tablero, which, first, became, common, in, teotihuacan, this, style, consists, of, a, platform, structure, or, the, tablero, on, top, of, a, sloped, talud, many, different, variants, on, the, talud, tablero, style, arose, throughout, mesoamerica, developing, and, manifesting, itself, differently, among, the, various, cultures, palenque, tikal, cop, n, tonina, the, corbeled, arch, chich, n, itz, tula, hidalgo, chacmools, atlantean, figures, quetzalcoatl, designs, so, named, after, the, puuc, hills, in, which, this, style, developed, and, flourished, during, the, latter, portion, of, the, late, classic, and, throughout, the, terminal, classic, in, the, northern, maya, lowlands, puuc, architecture, consists, of, veneer, facing, stones, applied, to, a, concrete, core, two, fa, ades, were, typically, built, partitioned, by, a, ridge, of, stone, the, blank, lower, fa, ade, is, formed, by, flat, cut, stones, and, punctuated, by, doorways, the, upper, partition, is, richly, decorated, with, repeating, geometric, patterns, and, iconographic, elements, especially, the, distinctive, curved, nosed, chaac, masks, carved, columnettes, are, also, common, mesoamerican, cultures, never, invented, the, keystone, and, so, were, unable, to, build, true, arches, but, instead, all, of, their, architecture, made, use, of, the, false, or, corbelled, arch, these, arches, are, built, without, centering, and, can, be, built, without, support, by, corbelling, regularly, the, horizontal, courses, of, the, wall, masonry, this, type, of, arch, supports, much, less, weight, than, a, true, arch, however, recent, work, by, engineer, james, o, kon, suggests, the, mesoamerican, arch, is, technically, not, a, corbelled, arch, at, all, but, a, trapezium, truss, system, moreover, unlike, a, corbelled, arch, it, does, not, rely, on, overlapping, layers, of, blocks, but, cast, in, place, concrete, often, supported, by, timber, thrust, beams, computer, analysis, reveals, this, to, be, structurally, superior, to, a, curved, arch, scholars, such, as, david, eccott, and, gordon, ekholm, argue, that, true, arches, were, known, in, pre, columbian, times, in, mesoamerica, they, point, to, various, examples, of, true, arches, at, a, maya, site, in, la, muneca, the, facade, of, temple, a, at, nukum, two, low, domes, at, tajin, in, veracruz, a, sweat, bath, at, chichen, itza, and, an, arch, at, oztuma, in, 2010, a, robot, discovered, a, long, arch, roofed, passageway, underneath, the, pyramid, of, quetzalcoatl, which, stands, in, the, ancient, city, of, teotihuacan, north, of, mexico, city, dated, to, around, 200, ad, a, number, of, important, archeological, sites, representing, mesoamerican, architecture, have, been, categorized, as, world, heritage, sites, by, the, unesco, el, salvador, honduras, guatemala, mexico
