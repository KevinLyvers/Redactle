fostered, by, such, intellectual, energy, that, the, first, written, manifestations, of, a, spanish, literature, proper, arise, the, period, of, islamic, rule, in, iberia, from, 711, to, 1492, brought, many, new, literary, traditions, to, spain, most, literature, at, this, time, was, produced, in, standard, arabic, though, poetry, and, other, forms, of, literature, of, the, jewish, golden,

written, in, arabic, script, the, jarchas, appeared, at, the, end, of, longer, poetry, written, in, arabic, or, hebrew, known, as, muwashshah, which, were, lengthy, glosses, on, the, ideas, expressed, in, the, jarchas, typically, spoken, in, the, voice, of, a, woman, the, jarchas, express, the, anxieties, of, love, particularly, of, its, loss, this, combination, of, hispano, romance, expression, with, arabic, script, only, discovered, in, 1948, locates, the, rise, of, a, spanish, literary, tradition, in, the, cultural, heterogeneity, that, characterized, medieval, spanish, society, and, politics, however, the, mozarabic, language, of, the, jarchas, appears, to, be, a, separate, romance, language, whose, evolution, from, vulgar, latin, paralleled, that, of, castilian, spanish, rather, than, deriving, from, or, fusing, into, the, latter, hence, while, the, relatively, recent, discovery, of, the, jarchas, challenges, pride, of, chronological, place, that, belonged, for, so, long, to, the, poema, del, cid, el, cantar, de, m, o, cid, 1140, ce, in, the, history, of, spanish, literature, they, cannot, be, seen, as, a, precursor, to, spain, s, great, epic, poem, what, the, discovery, of, the, jarchas, makes, clear, instead, is, that, from, its, origins, the, literature, of, spain, has, arisen, out, of, and, born, witness, to, a, rich, heterogeneous, mix, of, cultures, and, languages, the, epic, poem, cantar, de, mio, cid, was, written, about, a, real, man, his, battles, conquests, and, daily, life, the, poet, name, unknown, wrote, the, epic, in, about, 1140, and, cid, supposedly, died, forty, years, before, in, 1099, this, epic, represents, realism, because, nothing, was, exaggerated, and, the, details, are, very, real, even, the, geography, correctly, portrays, the, areas, in, which, cid, traveled, and, lived, unlike, other, european, epics, the, poem, is, not, idealized, and, there, is, no, presence, of, supernatural, beings, it, has, assonance, instead, of, rhyme, and, its, lines, vary, in, length, the, most, common, length, being, fourteen, syllables, this, type, of, verse, is, known, as, mester, de, juglaria, verse, form, of, the, minstrels, the, epic, is, divided, into, three, parts, also, known, as, cantos, medieval, spanish, poets, recognized, the, mester, de, juglar, a, as, a, literary, form, written, by, the, minstrels, juglares, and, composed, of, varying, line, length, and, use, of, assonance, instead, of, rhyme, these, poems, were, sung, to, uneducated, audiences, nobles, and, peasants, alike, this, castilian, narrative, poetry, known, as, the, mester, de, clerec, a, became, popular, in, the, thirteenth, century, it, is, the, verse, form, of, the, learned, poets, usually, clerics, hence, the, name, clerec, a, the, poetry, was, formal, with, carefully, counted, syllables, in, each, line, popular, themes, were, christian, legends, lives, of, saints, and, tales, from, classical, antiquity, the, poems, were, recited, to, villagers, in, public, plazas, two, traits, separate, this, form, from, the, mester, de, juglar, a, didacticism, and, erudition, gonzalo, de, berceo, was, one, of, the, greatest, advocates, of, this, school, writing, on, religious, subjects, spanish, prose, gained, popularity, in, the, mid, thirteenth, century, when, king, alfonso, x, of, castile, gave, support, and, recognition, to, the, writing,

for, his, prose, work, el, conde, lucanor, which, is, a, frame, story, or, short, stories, within, an, overall, story, in, this, work, the, conde, lucanor, seeks, advice, from, his, wise, counselor, patronio, who, gives, the, advice, through, the, telling, of, stories, juan, manuel, also, wrote, lesser, known, works, such, as, el, libro, de, los, estados, on, the, social, classes, and, el, libro,

1920s, thanks, to, azor, n, s, designation, of, his, fellow, writers, as, a, generation, contemporary, critics, and, later, literary, historians, were, to, catalogue, and, then, interpret, the,

became, the, spokesman, for, this, and, essential, every, generation, of, writers, in, the, first, half, of, the, twentieth, century, in, essays, like, meditations, on, the, quijote, the, rebellion, of, the, masses, and, most, famously, the, dehumanization, of, art, ortega, laid, out, theories, of, art, and, society, that, lucidly, explained, and, celebrated, twentieth, century, vanguard, experimentation, while, holding, fast, to, an, elitist, social, vision, whose, eclipse, this, art, ironically, expressed, the, most, elusive, voice, of, this, generation, and, arguably, unclassifiable, within, this, group, was, the, novelist, ram, n, g, mez, de, la, serna, who, carried, the, narrative, experiments, of, unamuno, and, valle, incl, n, to, absurd, extremes, such, as, in, his, 1923, novel, el, novelista, where, varieties, of, plays, with, narrative, subjectivity, result, in, chapters, envisioned, through, the, eyes, and, voice, of, street, lamps, more, approachable,

1914, poets, pedro, salinas, jorge, guill, n, federico, garc, a, lorca, vicente, aleixandre, d, maso, alonso, rafael, alberti, luis, cernuda, manuel, altolaguirre, were, likewise, the, most, closely,

generation, were, full, time, university, professors, while, others, spent, periods, as, guest, teachers, and, students, all, were, scholars, of, their, national, literary, heritage, again, evidence, of, the, impact, of, the, calls, of, regeneracionistas, and, the, generation, of, 1898, for, spanish, intelligence, to, turn, at, least, partially, inwards, this, group, of, poets, continues, to, be, without, contest, the, most, celebrated, and, studied, of, spain, s, twentieth, century, writers, their, work, provides, a, capstone, to, what, some, have, called, the, silver, age, of, spanish, letters, a, period, that, began, with, the, veritable, explosion, of, novel, production, following, the, bloodless, coup, of, 1868, and, that, would, come, to, a, tragic, end, with, the, outbreak, of, civil, war, in, july, 1936, the, writing, of, this, supposed, generation, can, be, roughly, divided, into, three, moments, in, their, early, years, their, work, arises, still, out, of, mostly, local, and, national, traditions, culminating, in, their, united, celebration, of, the, tri, centennial, of, the, death, of, golden, age, poet, luis, de, g, ngora, from, mid, decade, until, the, arrival, of,

spain, s, bloody, civil, war, the, spanish, civil, war, lasting, from, july, 1936, to, april, 1939, had, a, devastating, impact, on, the, trajectory, of, spanish, letters, in, july, 1936, spain, was, at, the, height, of, its, silver, age, every, major, writer, of, the, three, major, generations, 1898, 1914, and, 1927, was, still, alive, and, productive, those, of, 1914, and, 1927, were, at, the, height, or, just, reaching, the, height, of, their, literary, powers, several, were, recognized, among, western, civilization, s, most, talented, and, influential, writers, but, by, april, 1939, miguel, de, unamuno, antonio, machado, and, federico, garc, a, lorca, among, others, were, dead, all, but, a, small, handful, of, the, remaining, writers, had, fled, into, exile, dispersed, across, the, length, of, the, american, continent, most, never, to, enjoy, the, close, associations, of, conferences, tertulias, and, theater, premiers, that, had, so, often, united, them, in, pre, war,
