while, they, are, gone, the, old, women, make, overtures, to, the, old, men, the, old, men, are, content, to, be, comforted, and, fussed, over, by, the, old, women, thereupon, the, two, choruses, merge, singing, and, dancing, in, unison, peace, talks, commence, and, lysistrata, introduces, the, spartan, and, athenian, delegates, to, a, gorgeous, young, woman, called, reconciliation, the, delegates, cannot, take, their, eyes, off, the, young, woman, meanwhile, lysistrata, scolds, both, sides, for, past, errors, of, judgment, the, delegates, briefly, squabble, over, the, peace, terms, but, with, reconciliation, before, them, and, the, burden, of, sexual, deprivation, still, heavy, upon, them, they, quickly, overcome, their, differences, and, retire, to, the, acropolis, for,

round, of, songs, the, men, and, women, dancing, together, all, sing, a, merry, song, in, praise, of, athene, goddess, of, wisdom, and, chastity, whose, citadel, provided, a, refuge, for, the, women, during, the, events, of, the, comedy, and, whose, implied, blessing, has, brought, about, a, happy, ending, to, the, play, some, events, that, are, significant, for, understanding, the, play, old, comedy, was, a, highly, topical, genre, and, the, playwright, expected, his, audience, to, be, familiar, with, local, identities, and, issues, the, following, list, of, identities, mentioned, in, the, play, gives, some, indication, of, the, difficulty, faced, by, any, producer, trying, to, stage, lysistrata, for, modern, audiences, pellene, was, also, the, name, of, a, peloponnesian, town, resisting, spartan, pressure, to, contribute, to, naval, operations, against, athens, at, this, time, it, was, mentioned, earlier, in, the, birds, modern, adaptations, of, lysistrata, are, often, feminist, or, pacifist, in, their, aim, see, influence, and, legacy, below, the, original, play, was, neither, feminist, nor, unreservedly, pacifist, even, when, they, seemed, to, demonstrate, empathy, with, the, female, condition, dramatic, poets, in, classical, athens, still, reinforced, sexual, stereotyping, of, women, as, irrational, creatures, in, need, of, protection, from, themselves, and, from, others, in, fact, the, play, might, not, even, be, a, plea, for, an, end, to, the, war, so, much, as, an, imaginative, vision, of, an, honorable, end, to, the, war, at, a, time, when, no, such, ending, was, possible, according, to, sarah, ruden, lysistrata, hackett, classics, 2003, the, play, nowhere, suggests, that, warfare, in, itself, is, intolerable, let, alone, immoral,
