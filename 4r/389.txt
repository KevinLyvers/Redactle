to, american, music, in, jamaica, and, my, favorite, artist, was, james, brown, that, s, who, inspired, me, a, lot, of, the, records, i, played, were, by, james, brown, herc, also, says, that, he, was, not, influenced, by, jamaican, sound, system, parties, as, he, was, too, young, to, experience, them, when, he, was, in, jamaica, in, a, 2020, interview, dj, kool, herc, s, sister, cindy, campbell, said, that, she, wanted, jamaica, to, reclaim, hip, hop, because, as, she, put, it, we, are, the, ones, who, bought, the, style, and, the, technique, to, america, which, became, hip, hop, because, the, percussive, breaks, in, funk, soul, and, disco, records, were, generally, short, herc, and, other, djs, began, using, two, turntables, to, extend, the, breaks, on, august, 11, 1973, dj,

artists, and, fans, of, the, east, coast, hip, hop, and, west, coast, hip, hop, scenes, in, the, united, states, especially, from, 1994, to, 1997, focal, points, of, the, feud, were, east, coast, based, rapper, the, notorious, b, i, g, and, his, new, york, based, label, bad, boy, records, and, west, coast, based, rapper, tupac, shakur, and, his, los, angeles, based, label, death, row, records, this, rivalry, started, before, the, rappers, themselves, hit, the, scene, because, new, york, is, the, birthplace, of, hip, hop, artists, from, the, west, coast, felt, as, if, they, were, not, receiving, the, same, media, coverage, and, public, attention, as, the, east, coast, as, time, went, on, both, rappers, began, to, grow, in, fame, and, as, they, both, became, more, known, the,
