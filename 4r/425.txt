new, york, city, influenced, in, part, by, evans, who, had, been, a, member, of, the, ensemble, in, 1958, and, was, called, back, for, this, album, davis, departed, further, from, his, early, hard, bop, style, in, favor, of, greater, experimentation, with, musical, modes, as, on, the, title, track, of, his, previous, album, milestones, 1958, basing, kind, of, blue, entirely, on, modality, he, gave, each, performer, a, set, of, scales, that, encompassed, the, parameters, of, their, improvisation, and, style, and, consequently, more, creative, freedom, with, melodies, coltrane, later, expanded, on, this, modal, approach, in, his, own, solo, career, kind, of, blue, is, regarded, by, many, critics, as, davis, s, masterpiece, the, greatest, jazz, album, ever, recorded, and, one, of, the, best, albums, of, all, time, its, impact, on, music, including, jazz, rock, and, classical, genres, has, led, writers, to, also, deem, it, one, of, the, most, influential, albums, ever, made, the, lp, was, one, of, fifty, recordings, chosen, in, 2002, by, the, library, of, congress, for, the, inaugural, year, of, the, national, recording, registry, and, in, 2003, it, was, ranked, number, 12, on, rolling, stone, magazine, s, list, of, the, 500, greatest, albums, of, all, time, in, 2019, kind, of, blue, was, certified, 5, platinum, by, the, recording, industry, association, of, america, riaa, for, shipments, of, at, least, five, million, copies, in, the, united, states, by, late, 1958, trumpeter, miles, davis, employed, one, of, the, most, acclaimed, and, profitable, hard, bop, bands, in, the, business, bassist, paul, chambers, had, been, with, the, group, from, its, beginning, in, 1955, alto, saxophonist, julian, cannonball, adderley, joined, in, late, 1957, and, tenor, saxophonist, john, coltrane, returned, in, early, 1958, drummer, jimmy, cobb, replaced, philly, joe, jones, in, may, 1958, and, pianist, wynton, kelly, replaced, bill, evans, in, november, 1958, the, davis, band, played, a, mixture, of, pop, standards, blues, and, bebop, originals, by, composers, such, as, charlie, parker, thelonious, monk, dizzy, gillespie, tadd, dameron, and, davis, himself, as, with, all, bebop, based, jazz, davis, s, groups, improvised, on, the, chord, changes, of, a, given, song, davis, was, one, of, many, jazz, musicians, growing, dissatisfied, with, bebop, however, and, saw, its, increasingly, complex, chord, changes, as, hindering, creativity, in, 1953, the, composer, and, theorist, george, russell, published, his, lydian, chromatic, concept, of, tonal, organization, which, offered, an, alternative, to, improvisation, based, on, chords, abandoning, the, traditional, major, and, minor, key, relationships, his, concept, introduced, the, idea, of, chord, scale, unity, and, was, the, first, theory, to, explore, the, vertical, relationship, between, chords, and, scales, these, insights, helped, lead, the, way, to, modal, jazz, influenced, by, russell, s, ideas, davis, implemented, his, first, modal, composition, with, the, title, track, of, his, studio, album, milestones, 1958, satisfied, with, the, results, davis, prepared, an, entire, album, based, on, modality, evans, who, had, studied, and, recorded, with, russell, but, had, left, the, davis, group, to, pursue, his, own, career, was, drafted, back, into, the, project, kind, of, blue, was, recorded, on, three, track, tape, in, two, sessions, at, columbia, records, 30th, street, studio, in, new, york, city, on, march, 2, 1959, the, tracks, so, what, freddie, freeloader, and, blue, in, green, were, recorded, for, side, one, of, the, original, lp, and, on, april, 22, the, tracks, all, blues, and, flamenco, sketches, were, recorded, making, up, side, two, as, was, davis, s, penchant, he, called, for, almost, no, rehearsal, and, the, musicians, had, little, idea, what, they, were, to, record, as, described, in, the, original, liner, notes, by, pianist, bill, evans, davis, had, only, given, the, band, sketches, of, scales, and, melody, lines, on, which, to, improvise, once, the, musicians, were, assembled, davis, gave, brief, instructions, for, each, piece, and, then, set, to, taping, the, sextet, in, studio, while, the, results, were, impressive, with, so, little, preparation, the, persistent, legend, that, the, entire, album, was, recorded, in, one, pass, is, untrue, only, flamenco, sketches, yielded, a, complete, take, on, the, first, try, that, take, which, is, not, the, master, was, added, to, the, 1997, cd, reissue, of, the, album, as, a, bonus, track, the, five, master, takes, issued, were, the, only, other, complete, takes, an, insert, for, the, ending, to, freddie, freeloader, was, recorded, but, was, not, used, for, release, or, on, the, issues, of, kind, of, blue, prior, to, the, 1997, reissue, pianist, wynton, kelly, may, not, have, been, happy, to, see, the, man, he, replaced, bill, evans, back, in, his, old, seat, perhaps, to, assuage, the, pianist, s, feelings, davis, had, kelly, play, instead, of, evans, on, the, album, s, most, blues, oriented, number, freddie, freeloader, the, live, album, miles, davis, at, newport, 1958, documents, the, sextet, during, evans, s, tenure, however, it, is, in, a, hard, bop, style, rather, than, the, modal, approach, of, kind, of, blue, the, more, ruminative, side, of, evans, s, playing, while, he, was, a, member, of, the, band, can, best, be, heard, on, his, lengthy, solo, on, my, funny, valentine, from, jazz, at, the, plaza, vol, i, kind, of, blue, was, produced, by, columbia, staff, producer, irving, townsend, 195, however, over, the, years, there, has, been, confusion, with, davis, s, subsequent, producer, teo, macero, getting, partial, or, full, credit, in, the, case, of, kind, of, blue, there, were, two, producers, teo, macero, and, irving, townsend, said, jazz, historian, eric, nisenson, macero, s, role, however, was, clearly, that, of, an, apprentice, and, observer, the, recording, session, was, also, cited, by, nisenson, as, macero, s, first, experience, with, the, highs, and, lows, of, working, with, miles, from, macero, s, own, recollection, his, involvement, in, the, recording, included, box, everyone, in, so, that, there, would, be, a, physical, closeness, among, the, musicians, not, like, today, when, the, musicians, are, spread, all, over, the, place, according, to, high, fidelity, though, his, role, in, kind, of, blue, has, been, disputed, the, recording, was, made, under, the, auspices, of, macero, however, it, is, townsend, s, voice, heard, on, the, session, tapes, who, became, davis, s, producer, after, the, departures, of, george, avakian, and, cal, lampley, macero, did, not, produce, davis, until, after, townsend, took, over, west, coast, production, duties, for, columbia, records, when, macero, took, his, place, 90, macero, s, first, davis, production, was, his, next, record, sketches, of, spain, 166, the, original, lp, did, not, credit, a, producer, the, first, release, with, a, producer, credit, was, the, 1987, cd, which, credited, only, macero, however, this, was, in, error, macero, only, produced, that, reissue, not, the, sessions, for, the, original, album, 195, the, 1997, minidisc, reissue, credited, both, townsend, and, macero, but, the, subsequent, 1997, 1999, 2004, 2008, and, 2015, reissues, all, correctly, credit, only, townsend, kind, of, blue, is, based, entirely, on, modality, diverging, from, davis, s, earlier, hard, bop, style, of, jazz, with, its, complex, chord, progression, and, improvisation, the, entire, album, was, a, series, of, modal, sketches, with, each, performer, given, a, set, of, scales, that, encompassed, the, parameters, of, their, improvisation, and, style, this, recording, style, contrasted, with, the, typical, preparation, of, providing, musicians, with, the, complete, score, or, for, improvisational, jazz, providing, the, musicians, with, a, chord, progression, or, series, of, harmonies, modal, jazz, was, not, unique, to, this, album, davis, himself, had, previously, used, the, same, method, on, his, 1958, milestones, album, the, 58, sessions, and, porgy, and, bess, 1958, on, which, he, used, modal, influences, for, collaborator, gil, evans, s, third, stream, compositions, modal, composition, with, its, reliance, on, scales, and, modes, represented, as, davis, called, it, a, return, to, melody, in, a, 1958, interview, with, nat, hentoff, of, the, jazz, review, davis, elaborated, on, this, form, of, composition, in, contrast, to, the, chord, progression, predominant, in, bebop, stating, no, chords, gives, you, a, lot, more, freedom, and, space, to, hear, things, when, you, go, this, way, you, can, go, on, forever, you, don, t, have, to, worry, about, changes, and, you, can, do, more, with, the, line, it, becomes, a, challenge, to, see, how, melodically, innovative, you, can, be, when, you, re, based, on, chords, you, know, at, the, end, of, 32, bars, that, the, chords, have, run, out, and, there, s, nothing, to, do, but, repeat, what, you, ve, just, done, with, variations, i, think, a, movement, in, jazz, is, beginning, away, from, the, conventional, string, of, chords, there, will, be, fewer, chords, but, infinite, possibilities, as, to, what, to, do, with, them, bill, evans, wrote, in, the, lp, liner, notes, miles, conceived, these, settings, only, hours, before, the, recording, dates, evans, continued, with, an, introduction, concerning, the, modes, used, in, each, composition, on, the, album, so, what, consists, of, two, modes, sixteen, measures, of, the, first, followed, by, eight, measures, of, the, second, and, then, eight, again, of, the, first, freddie, freeloader, is, a, standard, twelve, bar, blues, form, blue, in, green, consists, of, a, ten, measure, cycle, following, a, short, four, measure, introduction, all, blues, is, a, twelve, bar, blues, form, in, 6, 8, time, flamenco, sketches, consists, of, five, scales, which, are, each, played, as, long, as, the, soloist, wishes, until, he, has, completed, the, series, the, liner, notes, list, davis, as, author, of, all, compositions, but, many, scholars, and, fans, believe, that, bill, evans, wrote, part, or, the, whole, of, blue, in, green, and, flamenco, sketches, bill, evans, assumed, co, credit, with, davis, for, blue, in, green, when, recording, it, on, his, portrait, in, jazz, album, and, the, davis, estate, acknowledged, evans, authorship, in, 2002, since, its, release, on, august, 17, 1959, kind, of, blue, has, been, regarded, by, critics, as, davis, s, greatest, work, it, is, his, most, acclaimed, album, and, became, along, with, davis, s, 1970, album, bitches, brew, his, best, selling, record, cementing, him, as, one, of, the, most, successful, jazz, artists, in, history, music, writer, chris, morris, cited, kind, of, blue, as, the, distillation, of, davis, s, art, cobb, said, the, album, must, have, been, made, in, heaven, kind, of, blue, has, been, lauded, as, one, of, the, most, influential, albums, in, the, history, of, jazz, one, reviewer, has, called, it, a, defining, moment, of, twentieth, century, music, several, of, the, pieces, from, the, album, have, become, jazz, standards, kind, of, blue, is, consistently, ranked, among, the, greatest, albums, of, all, time, in, a, review, of, the, album, allmusic, senior, editor, stephen, thomas, erlewine, stated, kind, of, blue, isn, t, merely, an, artistic, highlight, for, miles, davis, it, s, an, album, that, towers, above, its, peers, a, record, generally, considered, as, the, definitive, jazz, album, a, universally, acknowledged, standard, of, excellence, why, does, kind, of, blue, possess, such, a, mystique, perhaps, because, this, music, never, flaunts, its, genius, it, s, the, pinnacle, of, modal, jazz, tonality, and, solos, build, from, the, overall, key, not, chord, changes, giving, the, music, a, subtly, shifting, quality, it, may, be, a, stretch, to, say, that, if, you, don, t, like, kind, of, blue, you, don, t, like, jazz, but, it, s, hard, to, imagine, it, as, anything, other, than, a, cornerstone, of, any, jazz, collection, in, 1959, the, arrival, of, ornette, coleman, on, the, jazz, scene, via, his, fall, residency, at, the, five, spot, club, consolidated, by, the, release, of, his, the, shape, of, jazz, to, come, lp, in, 1959, muted, the, initial, impact, of, kind, of, blue, a, happenstance, that, irritated, davis, greatly, though, davis, and, coleman, both, offered, alternatives, to, the, rigid, rules, of, bebop, davis, would, never, reconcile, himself, to, coleman, s, free, jazz, innovations, although, he, would, incorporate, musicians, amenable, to, coleman, s, ideas, with, his, great, quintet, of, the, mid, 1960s, and, offer, his, own, version, of, free, playing, with, his, jazz, fusion, outfits, in, the, 1970s, the, influence, of, kind, of, blue, did, build, and, all, of, the, sidemen, from, the, album, went, on, to, achieve, success, on, their, own, evans, formed, his, influential, jazz, trio, with, bassist, scott, lafaro, and, drummer, paul, motian, cannonball,

wes, montgomery, among, others, and, coltrane, went, on, to, become, one, of, the, most, revered, and, innovative, of, all, jazz, musicians, even, more, than, davis, coltrane, took, the, modal, approach, and, ran, with, it, during, his, career, as, a, leader, in, the, 1960s, leavening, his, music, with, coleman, s, ideas, as, the, decade, progressed, kind, of, blue, has, appeared, on,

stating, it, s, one, thing, to, just, play, a, tune, or, play, a, program, of, music, but, it, s, another, thing, to, practically, create, a, new, language, of, music, which, is, what, kind, of, blue, did, gary, burton, of, berklee, college, of, music, noted, the, consistent, innovation, present, throughout, the, album, stating, it, wasn, t, just, one, tune, that, was, a, breakthrough, it, was, the, whole, record, when, new, jazz, styles, come, along, the, first, few, attempts, to, do, it, are, usually, kind, of, shaky, early, charlie, parker, records, were, like, this, but, with, kind, of,

by, music, writers, as, an, introductory, jazz, album, for, similar, reasons, the, music, on, both, records, is, very, melodic, and, the, relaxed, quality, of, the, songs, makes, the, improvisation,
