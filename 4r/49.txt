hall, which, was, built, in, the, 11th, century, and, survived, the, fire, of, 1834, was, incorporated, in, barry, s, design, pugin, was, displeased, with, the, result, of, the, work, especially, with, the, symmetrical, layout, designed, by, barry, he, famously, remarked, all, grecian, sir, tudor, details, on, a, classic, body, in, 1839, charles, barry, toured, britain, looking, at, quarries, and, buildings, with, a, committee, which, included, two, leading, geologists, and, a, stonecarver, they, selected, anston, a, sand, coloured, magnesian, limestone, quarried, in, the, villages, of, anston, south, yorkshire, and, mansfield, woodhouse, nottinghamshire, two, quarries, were, chosen, from, a, list, of, 102, with, the, majority, of, the, stone, coming, from, the, former, a, crucial, consideration, was, transport, achieved, on, water, via, the, chesterfield, canal, the, north, sea, and, the, rivers, trent, and, thames, furthermore, anston, was, cheaper, and, could, be, supplied, in, blocks, up, to, four, feet, thick, and, lent, itself, to, elaborate, carving, barry, s, new, palace, of, westminster, was, rebuilt, using, the, sandy, coloured, anston, limestone, however, the, stone, soon, began, to, decay, owing, to, pollution, and, the, poor, quality, of, some, of, the, stone, used, although, such, defects, were, clear, as, early, as, 1849, nothing, was, done, for, the, remainder, of, the, 19th, century, even, after, much, studying, during, the, 1910s, however, it, became, clear, that, some, of, the, stonework, had, to, be, replaced, in, 1928, it, was, deemed, necessary, to, use, clipsham, stone, a, honey, coloured, limestone, from, rutland, to, replace, the, decayed, anston, the, project, began, in, the, 1930s, but, was, halted, by, the, outbreak, of, the,
