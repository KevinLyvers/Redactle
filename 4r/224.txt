the, scouting, newspaper, le, boy, scout, belge, the, belgian, boy, scout, totor, was, a, strong, influence, on, tintin, with, herg, describing, the, latter, as, being, like, totor, s, younger, brother, jean, marc, and, randy, lofficier, stated, that, graphically, totor, and, tintin, were, virtually, identical, except, for, the, scout, uniform, also, noting, many, similarities, between, their, respective, adventures, particularly, in, the, illustration, style, the, fast, pace, of, the, story, and, the, use, of, humour, he, was, fascinated, by, new, techniques, in, the, medium, such, as, the, systematic, use, of, speech, bubbles, found, in, such, american, comics, as, george, mcmanus, bringing, up, father, george, herriman, s, krazy, kat, and, rudolph, dirks, s, katzenjammer,

congolese, as, childlike, idiots, in, later, decades, it, was, accused, of, racism, but, at, the, time, was, uncontroversial, and, popular, and, further, publicity, stunts, were, held, to, increase, sales, for, the, third, adventure, tintin, in, america, serialised, from, september, 1931, to, october, 1932, herg, finally, got, to, deal, with, a, scenario, of, his, own, choice, and, used, the,

magazine, named, c, urs, vaillants, brave, hearts, since, 1930, and, herg, was, soon, receiving, syndication, requests, from, swiss, and, portuguese, newspapers, too, herg, wrote, a, string, of, adventures, of, tintin, sending, his, character, to, real, locations, such, as, the, belgian, congo, united, states, egypt, india, tibet, china, and, the, united, kingdom, he, also, sent, tintin, to, fictional, countries, of, his, own, devising, such, as, the, latin, american, republic, of, san, theodoros, the, east, european, kingdom, of, syldavia, or, the, fascist, state, of, borduria, whose, leader, s, name, m, sstler, was, a, portmanteau, of, the, names, nazi, german, f, hrer, adolf, hitler, and, italian, fascist, prime, minister, benito, mussolini, in, may, 1940, nazi, germany, invaded, belgium, as, world, war, ii, spread, further, across, europe, although, herg, briefly, fled, to, france, and, was, considered, a, self, imposed, exile, he, ultimately, decided, to, return, to, his, occupied, homeland, for, political, reasons, the, nazi, authorities, closed, down, le, vingti, me, si, cle, leaving, herg, unemployed, in, search, of, employment, he, got, a, job, as, an, illustrator, at, belgium, s, leading, newspaper, le, soir, the, evening, which, was, allowed, to, continue, publication, under, german, management, on, 17, october, 1940, he, was, made, editor, of, the, children, s, supplement, le, soir, jeunesse, in, which, he, set, about, producing, new, tintin, adventures, in, this, new, more, repressive, political, climate, of, german, occupied, belgium, herg, could, no, longer, politicize, the, adventures, of, tintin, lest, he, be, arrested, by, the, gestapo, as, harry, thompson, noted, tintin, s, role, as, a, reporter, came, to, an, end, to, be, replaced, by, his, new, role, as, an, explorer, in, september, 1944, the, allies, entered, brussels, and, herg, s, german, employers, fled, le, soir, was, shut, down, and, the, adventures, of, tintin, was, put, on, hold, then, in, 1946, herg, accepted, an, invitation, from, belgian, comic, publisher, raymond, leblanc, and, his, new, publishing, company, le, lombard, to, continue, the, adventures, of, tintin, in, the, new, le, journal, de, tintin, tintin, magazine, herg, quickly, learned, that, he, no, longer, had, the, independence, he, preferred, he, was, required, to, produce, two, coloured, pages, a, week, for, leblanc, s, magazine, a, tall, order, in, 1950, herg, began, to, poach, the, better, members, of, the, tintin, magazine, staff, to, work, in, the, large, house, on, avenue, louise, that, contained, the, fledgling, studios, herg, bob, de, moor, who, imitated, herg, s, style, and, did, half, the, work, guy, dessicy, colourist, and, marcel, dehaye, secretary, were, the, nucleus, to, this, herg, added, jacques, martin, imitated, herg, s, style, roger, leloup, detailed, realistic, drawings, eug, ne, evany, later, chief, of, the, studios, michel, demaret, letterer, and, baudouin, van, den, branden, secretary, as, harry, thompson, observed, the, idea, was, to, turn, the, process, of, creating, the, adventures, of, tintin, into, a, veritable, production, line, the, artwork, passing, from, person, to, person, everyone, knowing, their, part, like, an, artistic, orchestra, with, herg, conducting, the, studios, produced, eight, new, tintin, albums, for, tintin, magazine, and, coloured, and, reformatted, two, old, tintin, albums, studios, herg, continued, to, release, additional, publications, until, herg, s, death, in, 1983, in, 1986, a, 24th, unfinished, album, was, released, the, studios, were, disbanded, and, the, assets, were, transferred, to, the, herg, foundation, tintin, is, a, young, belgian, reporter, and, adventurer, who, becomes, involved, in, dangerous, cases, in, which, he, takes, heroic, action, to, save, the, day, the, adventures, may, feature, tintin, hard, at, work, in, his, investigative, journalism, but, seldom, is, he, seen, actually, turning, in, a, story, readers, and, critics, have, described, tintin, as, a, well, rounded, yet, open, ended, intelligent, and, creative, character, noting, that, his, lack, of, backstory, and, neutral, personality, permits, a, reflection, of, the, evil, folly, and, foolhardiness, which, surrounds, him, the, character, never, compromises, his, boy, scout, ideals, which, represent, herg, s, own, and, his, status, allows, the, reader, to, assume, his, position, within, the, story, rather, than, merely, following, the, adventures, of, a, strong, protagonist, tintin, s, iconic, representation, enhances, this, aspect, with, scott, mccloud, noting, that, it, allows, readers, to, mask, themselves, in, a, character, and, safely, enter, a, sensually, stimulating, world, tintin, frequently, is, depicted, wearing, plus, fours, a, type, of, trouser, favoured, by, golfers, and, aristocrats, snowy, milou, in, herg, s, original, version, a, white, wire, fox, terrier, dog, is, tintin, s, loyal, companion, like, captain, haddock, snowy, is, fond, of, loch, lomond, brand, scotch, whisky, and, his, occasional, bouts, of, drinking, tend, to, get, him, into, unintentional, trouble, as, does, his, only, fear, arachnids, captain, archibald, haddock, capitaine, haddock, in, herg, s, original, version, is, a, merchant, marine, sea, captain, and, tintin, s, best, friend, introduced, in, the, crab, with, the, golden, claws, haddock, is, initially, depicted, as, a, weak, and, alcoholic, character, but, later, evolves, to, become, genuinely, heroic, and, even, a, socialite, after, he, finds, a, treasure, from, his, ancestor, sir, francis, haddock, chevalier, fran, ois, de, hadoque, in, the, original, version, the, captain, s, coarse, humanity, and, sarcasm, act, as, a, counterpoint, to, tintin, s, often, implausible, heroism, he, is, always, quick, with, a, dry, comment, whenever, the, boy, reporter, seems, too, idealistic, the, hot, tempered, haddock, uses, a, range, of, colourful, insults, and, curses, to, express, his, feelings, such, as, billions, of, bilious, blue, blistering, barnacles, mille, milliards, de, mille, sabords, de, tonnerre, de, brest, in, the, original, version, or, ten, thousand, thundering, typhoons, professor, cuthbert, calculus, professeur, tryphon, tournesol, in, herg, s, original, version, tournesol, is, the, french,

carreidases, or, more, prosaically, jolyon, waggs, and, bolt, the, builders, tintin, represents, an, unattainable, ideal, of, goodness, cleanness, authenticity, literary, critic, tom, mccarthy, 2006, herg, s, supporting, characters, have, been, cited, as, far, more, developed, than, the, central, character, each, imbued, with, strength, of, character, and, depth, of, personality, which, has, been, compared, with, that, of, the, characters, of, charles, dickens, herg, used, the, supporting, characters, to, create, a, realistic, world, in, which, to, set, his, protagonists, adventures, to, further, the, realism, and, continuity, characters, would, recur, throughout, the, series, the, occupation, of, belgium, and, the, restrictions, imposed, upon, herg, forced, him, to, focus, on, characterisation, to, avoid, depicting, troublesome, political, situations, as, a, result, the, colourful, supporting, cast, was, developed, during, this, period, thomson, and, thompson, dupont, et,

countries, to, which, i, sent, tintin, out, of, a, sense, of, responsibility, to, my, readers, herg, s, use, of, research, and, photographic, reference, allowed, him, to, build, a, realised, universe, for, tintin, going, so, far, as, to, create, fictionalised, countries, dressing, them, with, specific, political, cultures, these, were, heavily, informed, by, the, cultures, evident, in, herg, s, lifetime, pierre, skilling, has, asserted, that, herg, saw, monarchy, as, the, legitimate, form, of, government, noting, that, democratic, values, seem, underrepresented, in, a, classic, franco,

neighbouring, borduria, with, an, attempted, annexation, appearing, in, king, ottokar, s, sceptre, this, situation, parallels, the, italian, conquest, of, albania, and, that, of, czechoslovakia, and, austria, by, expansionist, nazi, germany, prior, to, world, war, ii, herg, s, use, of, research, would, include, months, of, preparation, for, tintin, s, voyage, to, the, moon, in, the, two, part, storyline, spread, across, destination, moon, and, explorers, on, the, moon, his, research, for, the, storyline, was, noted, in, new, scientist, the, considerable, research, undertaken, by, herg, enabled, him, to, come, very, close, to, the, type, of, space, suit, that, would, be, used, in, future, moon, exploration, although, his, portrayal, of, the, type, of, rocket, that, was, actually, used, was, a, long, way, off, the, mark, the, moon, rocket, is, based, on, the, german, v, 2, rockets, in, his, youth, herg, admired, benjamin, rabier, and, suggested, that, a, number, of, images, within, tintin, in, the, land, of, the, soviets, reflected, his, influence, particularly, the, pictures, of, animals, ren, vincent, the, art, deco, designer, also, affected, early, tintin, adventures, his, influence, can, be, detected, at, the, beginning, of, the, soviets, where, my, drawings, are, designed, along, a, decorative, line, like, an, s, herg, also, readily, adopted, the, image, of, round, noses, from, george, mcmanus, feeling, they, were, so, much, fun, that, i, used, them, without, scruples, during, the, extensive, research, herg, carried, out, for, the, blue, lotus, he, became, influenced, by, chinese, and, japanese, illustrative, styles, and, woodcuts, this, is, especially, noticeable, in, the, seascapes, which, are, reminiscent, of, works, by, hokusai, and, hiroshige, herg, also, declared, mark, twain, an, influence, although, this, admiration, may, have, led, him, astray, when, depicting, incas, as, having, no, knowledge, of, an, upcoming, solar, eclipse, in, prisoners, of, the, sun, an, error, t, f, mills, attributed, to, an, attempt, to, portray, incas, in, awe, of, a, latter, day, connecticut, yankee, tintin, first, appeared, in, english,

methuen, herg, s, british, publishers, it, was, a, joint, operation, headed, by, leslie, lonsdale, cooper, and, michael, turner, who, worked, closely, with, herg, to, attain, a, translation, as, true, as, possible, to, the, original, work, due, in, part, to, the, large, amount, of, language, specific, word, play, such, as, punning, in, the, series, especially, the, jokes, which, played, on, professor, calculus, partial, deafness, it, was, never, the, intention, to, translate, literally, instead, they, strove, to, fashion, a, work, whose, idioms, and, jokes, would, be, meritorious, in, their, own, right, despite, the, free, hand, herg, afforded, the, two, they, worked, closely, with, the, original, text, asking, for, regular, assistance, to, understand, herg, s, intentions, the, british, translations, were, also, anglicised, to, appeal, to, british, customs, and, values, milou, for, example, was, renamed, snowy, at, the, translators, discretion, captain, haddock, s, le, ch, teau, de, moulinsart, was, renamed, marlinspike, hall, when, it, came, time, to, translate, the, black, island, which, is, set, in, great, britain, the, opportunity, was, taken, to, redraw, the, entire, book, methuen, had, decided, that, the, book, did, not, portray, great, britain, accurately, enough, and, had, compiled, a, list, of, 131, errors, of, detail, which, needed, to, be, put, right, such, as, ensuring, that, the, british, police, were, unarmed, and, ensuring, that, scenes, of, the, british, countryside, would, be, acceptable, to, british, readers, the, resulting, 1966,

of, aeschylus, honor, de, balzac, joseph, conrad, and, henry, james, and, argues, that, the, series, contains, the, key, to, understanding, literature, itself, mccarthy, considered, the, adventures, of, tintin, to, be, stupendously, rich, containing, a, mastery, of, plot, and, symbol, theme, and, sub, text, which, influenced, by, tisseron, s, psychoanalytical, readings, of, the, work, he, believed, could, be, deciphered, to, reveal, a, series, of, recurring, themes, ranging, from, bartering, to, implicit, sexual, intercourse, that, herg, had, featured, throughout, the, series, reviewing, the, book, in, the, telegraph, toby, clements, argued, that, mccarthy, s, work, and, literary, criticism, of, herg, s, comic, strips, in, general, cut, perilously, close, to, simply, feeding, the, appetite, of, those, willing, to, cross, the, line, between, enthusiast, and, obsessive, in, the, tintinological, community, the, earliest, stories, in, the, adventures, of, tintin, have, been, criticised, for, animal, cruelty, colonialism, violence, and, ethnocentric, caricatured, portrayals, of, non, europeans, while, the, herg, foundation, has, presented, such, criticism, as, na, vet, and, scholars, of, herg, such, as, harry, thompson, have, said, that, herg, did, what, he, was, told, by, the, abb, wallez, herg, himself, felt, that, his, background, made, it, impossible, to, avoid, prejudice, stating, i, was, fed, the, prejudices, of, the, bourgeois, society, that, surrounded, me, in, tintin, in, the, land, of, the, soviets, the, bolsheviks, were, presented, as,

soviet, regime, although, herg, contextualised, this, by, noting, that, in, belgium, at, the, time, a, devout, catholic, nation, anything, bolshevik, was, atheist, in, the, story, bolshevik, leaders, are, motivated, by, personal, greed, and, a, desire, to, deceive, the, world, tintin, discovers, buried, the, hideout, where, lenin, trotsky, and, stalin, have, collected, together, wealth, stolen, from, the, people, in, 1999, the, issue, of, tintin, s, politics, was, the, subject, of, a, debate, in, the, french, parliament, this, event, prompted, the, british, weekly, newspaper, the, economist, to, publish, an, editorial, on, the, matter, tintin, in, the, congo, has, been, criticised, as, presenting, the, africans, as, na, ve, and, primitive, in, the, original, work, tintin, is, shown, at, a, blackboard, addressing, a, class, of, african, children, my, dear, friends, i, am, going, to, talk, to, you, today, about, your, fatherland, belgium, herg, redrew, this, in, 1946, to, show, a, lesson, in, mathematics, herg, later, admitted, the, flaws, in, the, original, story, excusing, it, saying, i, portrayed, these, africans, according, to, this, purely, paternalistic, spirit, of, the, time, sue, buswell, who, was, the, editor, of, tintin, at, methuen, summarised, the, perceived, problems, with, the, book, in, 1988, as, all, to, do, with, rubbery, lips, and, heaps, of, dead, animals, although, thompson, noted, her, quote, may, have, been, taken, out, of, context, drawing, on, andr, maurois, les, silences, du, colonel, bramble, herg, presents, tintin, as, a, big, game, hunter, accidentally, killing, fifteen, antelope, as, opposed, to, the, one, needed, for, the, evening, meal, however, concerns, over, the, number, of, dead, animals, led, tintin, s, scandinavian, publishers, to, request, changes, a, page, of, tintin, killing, a, rhinoceros, by, drilling, a, hole, in, its, back, and, inserting, a, stick, of, dynamite, was, deemed, excessive, herg, replaced,
