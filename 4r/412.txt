carmen, french, is, an, opera, in, four, acts, by, the, french, composer, georges, bizet, the, libretto, was, written, by, henri, meilhac, and, ludovic, hal, vy, based, on, the, novella, of, the, same, title, by, prosper, m, rim, e, the, opera, was, first, performed, by, the, op, ra, comique, in, paris, on, 3, march, 1875, where, its, breaking, of, conventions, shocked, and, scandalised, its, first, audiences, bizet, died, suddenly, after, the, 33rd, performance, unaware, that, the, work, would, achieve, international, acclaim, within, the, following, ten, years, carmen, has, since, become, one, of, the, most, popular, and, frequently, performed, operas, in, the, classical, canon, the, habanera, and, seguidilla, from, act, 1, and, the, toreador, song, from, act, 2, are, among, the, best, known, of, all, operatic, arias, the, opera, is, written, in, the, genre, of, op, ra, comique, with, musical, numbers, separated, by, dialogue, it, is, set, in, southern, spain, and, tells, the, story, of, the, downfall, of, don, jos, a, na, ve, soldier, who, is, seduced, by, the, wiles, of, the, fiery, gypsy, carmen, jos, abandons, his, childhood, sweetheart, and, deserts, from, his, military, duties, yet, loses, carmen, s, love, to, the, glamorous, torero, escamillo, after, which, jos, kills, her, in, a, jealous, rage, the, depictions, of, proletarian, life, immorality, and, lawlessness, and, the, tragic, death, of, the, main, character, on, stage, broke, new, ground, in, french, opera, and, were, highly, controversial, after, the, premiere, most, reviews, were, critical, and, the, french, public, was, generally, indifferent, carmen, initially, gained, its, reputation, through, a, series, of, productions, outside, france, and, was, not, revived, in, paris, until, 1883, thereafter, it, rapidly, acquired, popularity, at, home, and, abroad, later, commentators, have, asserted, that, carmen, forms, the, bridge, between, the, tradition, of, op, ra, comique, and, the, realism, or, verismo, that, characterised, late, 19th, century, italian, opera, the, music, of, carmen, has, since, been, widely, acclaimed, for, brilliance, of, melody, harmony, atmosphere, and, orchestration, and, for, the, skill, with, which, the, emotions, and, suffering, of, the, characters, are, represented, at, his, death, bizet, was, still, in, the, midst, of, revising, his, score, and, because, of, other, later, changes, notably, the, introduction, of, recitatives, composed, by, ernest, guiraud, in, place, of, the, original, dialogue, there, is, still, no, definitive, edition, of, the, opera, the, opera, has, been, recorded, many, times, since, the, first, acoustical, recording, in, 1908, and, the, story, has, been, the, subject, of, many, screen, and, stage, adaptations, in, the, paris, of, the, 1860s, despite, being, a, prix, de, rome, laureate, bizet, struggled, to, get, his, stage, works, performed, the, capital, s, two, main, state, funded, opera, houses, the, op, ra, and, the, op, ra, comique, followed, conservative, repertoires, that, restricted, opportunities, for, young, native, talent, bizet, s, professional, relationship, with, l, on, carvalho, manager, of, the, independent, th, tre, lyrique, company, enabled, him, to, bring, to, the, stage, two, full, scale, operas, les, p, cheurs, de, perles, 1863, and, la, jolie, fille, de, perth, 1867, but, neither, enjoyed, much, public, success, when, artistic, life, in, paris, resumed, after, the, franco, prussian, war, of, 1870, 71, bizet, found, wider, opportunities, for, the, performance, of, his, works, his, one, act, opera, djamileh, opened, at, the, op, ra, comique, in, may, 1872, although, this, failed, and, was, withdrawn, after, 11, performances, it, led, to, a, further, commission, from, the, theatre, this, time, for, a, full, length, opera, for, which, henri, meilhac, and, ludovic, hal, vy, would, provide, the, libretto, hal, vy, who, had, written, the, text, for, bizet, s, student, opera, le, docteur, miracle, 1856, was, a, cousin, of, bizet, s, wife, genevi, ve, he, and, meilhac, had, a, solid, reputation, as, the, librettists, of, many, of, jacques, offenbach, s, operettas, bizet, was, delighted, with, the, op, ra, comique, commission, and, expressed, to, his, friend, edmund, galabert, his, satisfaction, in, the, absolute, certainty, of, having, found, my, path, the, subject, of, the, projected, work, was, a, matter, of, discussion, between, composer, librettists, and, the, op, ra, comique, management, adolphe, de, leuven, on, behalf, of, the, theatre, made, several, suggestions, that, were, politely, rejected, it, was, bizet, who, first, proposed, an, adaptation, of, prosper, m, rim, e, s, novella, carmen, m, rim, e, s, story, is, a, blend, of, travelogue, and, adventure, yarn, possibly, inspired, by, the, writer, s, lengthy, travels, in, spain, in, 1830, and, had, originally, been, published, in, 1845, in, the, journal, revue, des, deux, mondes, it, may, have, been, influenced, in, part, by, alexander, pushkin, s, 1824, poem, the, gypsies, a, work, m, rim, e, had, translated, into, french, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, the, story, was, developed, from, an, incident, told, to, m, rim, e, by, his, friend, the, countess, montijo, bizet, may, first, have, encountered, the, story, during, his, rome, sojourn, of, 1858, 60,

hal, vy, were, a, long, standing, duo, with, an, established, division, of, labour, meilhac, who, was, completely, unmusical, wrote, the, dialogue, and, hal, vy, the, verses, there, is, no, clear, indication, of, when, work, began, on, carmen, bizet, and, the, two, librettists, were, all, in, paris, during, 1873, and, easily, able, to, meet, thus, there, is, little, written, record, or, correspondence, relating, to, the, beginning, of, the, collaboration, the, libretto, was, prepared, in, accordance, with, the, conventions, of, op, ra, comique, with, dialogue, separating, musical, numbers, it, deviates, from, m, rim, e, s, novella, in, a, number, of, significant, respects, in, the, original, events, are, spread, over, a, much, longer, period, of, time, and, much, of, the, main, story, is, narrated, by, jos, from, his, prison, cell, as, he, awaits, execution, for, carmen, s, murder, mica, la, does, not, feature, in, m, rim, e, s, version, and, the, escamillo, character, is, peripheral, a, picador, named, lucas, who, is, only, briefly, carmen, s, grand, passion, carmen, has, a, husband, called, garcia, whom, jos, kills, during, a, quarrel, in, the, novella, carmen, and, jos, are, presented, much, less, sympathetically, than, they, are, in, the, opera, bizet, s, biographer, mina, curtiss, comments, that, m, rim, e, s, carmen, on, stage, would, have, seemed, an, unmitigated, and, unconvincing, monster, had, her, character, not, been, simplified, and, deepened, with, rehearsals, due, to, begin, in, october, 1873, bizet, began, composing, in, or, around, january, of, that, year, and, by, the, summer, had, completed, the, music, for, the, first, act, and, perhaps, sketched, more, at, that, point, according, to, bizet, s, biographer, winton, dean, some, hitch, at, the, op, ra, comique, intervened, and, the, project, was, suspended, for, a, while, one, reason, for, the, delay, may, have, been, the, difficulties, in, finding, a, singer, for, the, title, role, another, was, a, split, that, developed, between, the, joint, directors, of, the, theatre, camille, du, locle, and, adolphe, de, leuven, over, the, advisability, of, staging, the, work, de, leuven, had, vociferously, opposed, the, entire, notion, of, presenting, so, risqu, a, story, in, what, he, considered, a, family, theatre, and, was, sure, audiences, would, be, frightened, away, he, was, assured, by, hal, vy, that, the, story, would, be, toned, down, that, carmen, s, character, would, be, softened, and, offset, by, mica, la, described, by, hal, vy, as, a, very, innocent, very, chaste, young, girl, furthermore, the, gypsies, would, be, presented, as, comic, characters, and, carmen, s, death, would, be, overshadowed, at, the, end, by, triumphal, processions, ballets, and, joyous, fanfares, de, leuven, reluctantly, agreed, but, his, continuing, hostility, towards, the, project, led, to, his, resignation, from, the, theatre, early, in, 1874, after, the, various, delays, bizet, appears, to, have, resumed, work, on, carmen, early, in, 1874, he, completed, the, draft, of, the, composition, 1, 200, pages, of, music, in, the, summer, which, he, spent, at, the, artists, colony, at, bougival, just, outside, paris, he, was, pleased, with, the, result, informing, a, friend, i, have, written, a, work, that, is, all, clarity, and, vivacity, full, of, colour, and, melody, during, the, period, of, rehearsals, which, began, in, october, bizet, repeatedly, altered, the, music, sometimes, at, the, request, of, the, orchestra, who, found, some, of, it, impossible, to, perform, sometimes, to, meet, the, demands, of, individual, singers, and, otherwise, in, response, to, the, demands, of, the, theatre, s, management, the, vocal, score, that, bizet, published, in, march, 1875, shows, significant, changes, from, the, version, of, the, score, he, sold, the, publishers, choudens, in, january, 1875, the, conducting, score, used, at, the, premiere, differs, from, each, of, these, documents, there, is, no, definitive, edition, and, there, are, differences, among, musicologists, about, which, version, represents, the, composer, s, true, intentions, bizet, also, changed, the, libretto, reordering, sequences, and, imposing, his, own, verses, where, he, felt, the, librettists, had, strayed, too, far, from, the, character, of, m, rim, e, s, original, among, other, changes, he, provided, new, words, for, carmen, s, habanera, and, rewrote, the, text, of, carmen, s, solo, in, the, act, 3, card, scene, he, also, provided, a, new, opening, line, for, the, seguidilla, in, act, 1, most, of, the, characters, in, carmen, the, soldiers, the, smugglers, the, gypsy, women, and, the, secondary, leads, mica, la, and, escamillo, are, reasonably, familiar, types, within, the, op, ra, comique, tradition, although, drawing, them, from, proletarian, life, was, unusual, the, two, principals, jos, and, carmen, lie, outside, the, genre, while, each, is, presented, quite, differently, from, m, rim, e, s, portrayals, of, a, murderous, brigand, and, a, treacherous, amoral, schemer, even, in, their, relatively, sanitised, forms, neither, corresponds, to, the, norms, of, op, ra, comique, they, are, more, akin, to, the, verismo, style, that, would, find, fuller, expression, in, the, works, of, puccini, dean, considers, that, jos, is, the, central, figure, of, the, opera, it, is, his, fate, rather, than, carmen, s, that, interests, us, the, music, characterises, his, gradual, decline, act, by, act, from, honest, soldier, to, deserter, vagabond, and, finally, murderer, in, act, 1, he, is, a, simple, countryman, aligned, musically, with, mica, la, in, act, 2, he, evinces, a, greater, toughness, the, result, of, his, experiences, as, a, prisoner, but, it, is, clear, that, by, the, end, of, the, act, his, infatuation, with, carmen, has, driven, his, emotions, beyond, control, dean, describes, him, in, act, 3, as, a, trapped, animal, who, refuses, to, leave, his, cage, even, when, the, door, is, opened, for, him, ravaged, by, a, mix, of, conscience, jealousy, and, despair, in, the, final, act, his, music, assumes, a, grimness, and, purposefulness, that, reflects, his, new, fatalism, he, will, make, one, more, appeal, if, carmen, refuses, he, knows, what, to, do, carmen, herself, says, dean, is, a, new, type, of, operatic, heroine, representing, a, new, kind, of, love, not, the, innocent, kind, associated, with, the, spotless, soprano, school, but, something, altogether, more, vital, and, dangerous, her, capriciousness, fearlessness, and, love, of, freedom, are, all, musically, represented, she, is, redeemed, from, any, suspicion, of, vulgarity, by, her, qualities, of, courage, and, fatalism, so, vividly, realised, in, the, music, curtiss, suggests, that, carmen, s, character, spiritually, and, musically, may, be, a, realisation, of, the, composer, s, own, unconscious, longing, for, a, freedom, denied, to, him, by, his, stifling, marriage, harold, c, schonberg, likens, carmen, to, a, female, don, giovanni, she, would, rather, die, than, be, false, to, herself, the, dramatic, personality, of, the, character, and, the, range, of, moods, she, is, required, to, express, call, for, exceptional, acting, and, singing, talents, this, has, deterred, some, of, opera, s, most, distinguished, exponents, maria, callas, though, she, recorded, the, part, never, performed, it, on, stage, the, musicologist, hugh, macdonald, observes, that, french, opera, never, produced, another, femme, as, fatale, as, carmen, though, she, may, have, influenced, some, of, massenet, s, heroines, macdonald, suggests, that, outside, the, french, repertoire, richard, strauss, s, salome, and, alban, berg, s, lulu, may, be, seen, as, distant, degenerate, descendants, of, bizet, s, temptress, bizet, was, reportedly, contemptuous, of, the, music, he, wrote, for, escamillo, well, they, asked, for, ordure, and, they, ve, got, it, he, is, said, to, have, remarked, about, the, toreador, s, song, but, as, dean, comments, the, triteness, lies, in, the, character, not, in, the, music, mica, la, s, music, has, been, criticised, for, its, gounodesque, elements, although, dean, maintains, that, her, music, has, greater, vitality, than, that, of, any, of, gounod, s, own, heroines, the, search, for, a, singer, actress, to, play, carmen, began, in, the, summer, of, 1873, press, speculation, favoured, zulma, bouffar, who, was, perhaps, the, librettists, preferred, choice, she, had, sung, leading, roles, in, many, of, offenbach, s, operas, but, she, was, unacceptable, to, bizet, and, was, turned, down, by, du, locle, as, unsuitable, in, september, an, approach, was, made, to, marie, roze, well, known, for, previous, triumphs, at, the, op, ra, comique, the, op, ra, and, in, london, she, refused, the, part, when, she, learned, that, she, would, be, required, to, die, on, stage, the, role, was, then, offered, to, c, lestine, galli, mari, who, agreed, to, terms, with, du, locle, after, several, months, negotiation, galli, mari, a, demanding, and, at, times, tempestuous, performer, would, prove, a, staunch, ally, of, bizet, often, supporting, his, resistance, to, demands, from, the, management, that, the, work, should, be, toned, down, at, the, time, it, was, generally, believed, that, she, and, the, composer, were, conducting, a, love, affair, during, the, months, of, rehearsal, the, leading, tenor, part, of, don, jos, was, given, to, paul, lh, rie, a, rising, star, of, the, op, ra, comique, who, had, recently, appeared, in, works, by, massenet, and, delibes, he, would, later, become, a, baritone, and, in, 1887, sang, the, role, of, zurga, in, the, covent, garden, premiere, of, les, p, cheurs, de, perles, jacques, bouhy, engaged, to, sing, escamillo, was, a, young, belgian, born, baritone, who, had, already, appeared, in, demanding, roles, such, as, m, phistoph, l, s, in, gounod, s, faust, and, as, mozart, s, figaro, marguerite, chapuy, who, sang, mica, la, was, at, the, beginning, of, a, short, career, in, which, she, was, briefly, a, star, at, london, s, theatre, royal, drury, lane, the, impresario, james, h, mapleson, thought, her, one, of, the, most, charming, vocalists, it, has, been, my, pleasure, to, know, however, she, married, and, left, the, stage, altogether, in, 1876, refusing, mapleson, s, considerable, cash, inducements, to, return, because, rehearsals, did, not, start, until, october, 1874, and, lasted, longer, than, anticipated, the, premiere, was, delayed, the, final, rehearsals, went, well, and, in, a, generally, optimistic, mood, the, first, night, was, fixed, for, 3, march, 1875, the, day, on, which, coincidentally, bizet, s, appointment, as, a, chevalier, of, the, legion, of, honour, was, formally, announced, the, premiere, which, was, conducted, by, adolphe, deloffre, was, attended, by, many, of, paris, s, leading, musical, figures, including, massenet, offenbach, delibes, and, gounod, during, the, performance, the, last, named, was, overheard, complaining, bitterly, that, bizet, had, stolen, the, music, of, mica, la, s, act, 3, aria, from, him, that, melody, is, mine, hal, vy, recorded, his, impressions, of, the, premiere, in, a, letter, to, a, friend, the, first, act, was, evidently, well, received, with, applause, for, the, main, numbers, and, numerous, curtain, calls, the, first, part, of, act, 2, also, went, well, but, after, the, toreador, s, song, there, was, hal, vy, noted, coldness, in, act, 3, only, mica, la, s, aria, earned, applause, as, the, audience, became, increasingly, disconcerted, the, final, act, was, glacial, from, first, to, last, and, bizet, was, left, only, with, the, consolations, of, a, few, friends, the, critic, ernest, newman, wrote, later, that, the, sentimentalist, op, ra, comique, audience, was, shocked, by, the, drastic, realism, of, the, action, and, by, the, low, standing, and, defective, morality, of, most, of, the, characters, according, to, the, composer, benjamin, godard, bizet, retorted, in, response, to, a, compliment, don, t, you, see, that, all, these, bourgeois, have, not, understood, a, wretched, word, of, the, work, i, have, written, for, them, in, a, different, vein, shortly, after, the, work, had, concluded, massenet, sent, bizet, a, congratulatory, note, how, happy, you, must, be, at, this, time, it, s, a, great, success, the, general, tone, of, the, next, day, s, press, reviews, ranged, from, disappointment, to, outrage, the, more, conservative, critics, complained, about, wagnerism, and, the, subordination, of, the, voice, to, the, noise, of, the, orchestra, there, was, consternation, that, the, heroine, was, an, amoral, seductress, rather, than, a, woman, of, virtue, galli, mari, s, interpretation, of, the, role, was, described, by, one, critic, as, the, very, incarnation, of, vice, others, compared, the, work, unfavourably, with, the, traditional, op, ra, comique, repertoire, of, auber, and, boieldieu, l, on, escudier, in, l, art, musical, called, carmen, s, music, dull, and, obscure, the, ear, grows, weary, of, waiting, for, the, cadence, that, never, comes, it, seemed, that, bizet, had, generally, failed, to, fulfill, expectations, both, of, those, who, given, hal, vy, s, and, meilhac, s, past, associations, had, expected, something, in, the, offenbach, mould, and, of, critics, such, as, adolphe, jullien, who, had, anticipated, a, wagnerian, music, drama, among, the, few, supportive, critics, was, the, poet, th, odore, de, banville, writing, in, le, national, he, applauded, bizet, for, presenting, a, drama, with, real, men, and, women, instead, of, the, usual, op, ra, comique, puppets, in, its, initial, run, at, the, op, ra, comique, carmen, provoked, little, public, enthusiasm, it, shared, the, theatre, for, a, while, with, verdi, s, much, more, popular, requiem, carmen, was, often, performed, to, half, empty, houses, even, when, the, management, gave, away, large, numbers, of, tickets, early, on, 3, june, the, day, after, the, opera, s, 33rd, performance, bizet, died, suddenly, of, heart, disease, at, the, age, of, 36, it, was, his, wedding, anniversary, that, night, s, performance, was, cancelled, the, tragic, circumstances, brought, a, temporary, increase, in, public, interest, during, the, brief, period, before, the, season, ended, du, locle, brought, carmen, back, in, november, 1875, with, the, original, cast, and, it, ran, for, a, further, 12, performances, until, 15, february, 1876, to, give, a, year, s, total, for, the, original, production, of, 48, among, those, who, attended, one, of, these, later, performances, was, tchaikovsky, who, wrote, to, his, benefactor, nadezhda, von, meck, carmen, is, a, masterpiece, in, every, sense, of, the, word, one, of, those, rare, creations, which, expresses, the, efforts, of, a, whole, musical, epoch, after, the, final, performance, carmen, was, not, seen, in, paris, again, until, 1883, shortly, before, his, death, bizet, signed, a, contract, for, a, production, of, carmen, by, the, vienna, court, opera, for, this, version, first, staged, on, 23, october, 1875, bizet, s, friend, ernest, guiraud, replaced, the, original, dialogue, with, recitatives, to, create, a, grand, opera, format, guiraud, also, reorchestrated, music, from, bizet, s, l, arl, sienne, suite, to, provide, a, spectacular, ballet, for, carmen, s, second, act, shortly, before, the, initial, vienna, performance, the, court, opera, s, director, franz, von, jauner, decided, to, use, parts, of, the, original, dialogue, along, with, some, of, guiraud, s, recitatives, this, hybrid, and, the, full, recitative, version, became, the, norms, for, productions, of, the, opera, outside, france, for, most, of, the, next, century, despite, its, deviations, from, bizet, s, original, format, and, some, critical, reservations, the, 1875, vienna, production, was, a, great, success, with, the, city, s, public, it, also, won, praise, from, both, wagner, and, brahms, the, latter, reportedly, saw, the, opera, twenty, times, and, said, he, would, have, gone, to, the, ends, of, the, earth, to, embrace, bizet, the, viennese, triumph, began, the, opera, s, rapid, ascent, towards, worldwide, fame, in, february, 1876, it, began, a, run, in, brussels, at, la, monnaie, it, returned, there, the, following, year, with, galli, mari, in, the, title, role, and, thereafter, became, a, permanent, fixture, in, the, brussels, repertory, on, 17, june, 1878, carmen, was, produced, in, london, at, her, majesty, s, theatre, where, minnie, hauk, began, her, long, association, with, the, part, of, carmen, a, parallel, london, production, at, covent, garden, with, adelina, patti, was, cancelled, when, patti, withdrew, the, successful, her, majesty, s, production, sung, in, italian, had, an, equally, enthusiastic, reception, in, dublin, on, 23, october, 1878, the, opera, received, its, american, premiere, at, the, new, york, academy, of, music, and, in, the, same, year, was, introduced, to, saint, petersburg, in, the, following, five, years, performances, were, given, in, numerous, american, and, european, cities, the, opera, found, particular, favour, in, germany, where, the, chancellor, otto, von, bismarck, apparently, saw, it, on, 27, different, occasions, and, where, friedrich, nietzsche, opined, that, he, became, a, better, man, when, bizet, speaks, to, me, carmen, was, also, acclaimed, in, numerous, french, provincial, cities, including, marseille, lyon, and, in, 1881, dieppe, where, galli, mari, returned, to, the, role, in, august, 1881, the, singer, wrote, to, bizet, s, widow, to, report, that, carmen, s, spanish, premiere, in, barcelona, had, been, another, great, success, but, carvalho, who, had, assumed, the, management, of, the, op, ra, comique, thought, the, work, immoral, and, refused, to, reinstate, it, meilhac, and, h, levy, were, more, prepared, to, countenance, a, revival, provided, that, galli, mari, had, no, part, in, it, they, blamed, her, interpretation, for, the, relative, failure, of, the, opening, run, in, april, 1883, carvalho, finally, revived, carmen, at, the, op, ra, comique, with, ad, le, isaac, featuring, in, an, under, rehearsed, production, that, removed, some, of, the, controversial, aspects, of, the, original, carvalho, was, roundly, condemned, by, the, critics, for, offering, a, travesty, of, what, had, come, to, be, regarded, as, a, masterpiece, of, french, opera, nevertheless, this, version, was, acclaimed, by, the, public, and, played, to, full, houses, in, october, carvalho, yielded, to, pressure, and, revised, the, production, he, brought, back, galli, mari, and, restored, the, score, and, libretto, to, their, 1875, forms, on, 9, january, 1884, carmen, was, given, its, first, new, york, metropolitan, opera, performance, to, a, mixed, critical, reception, the, new, york, times, welcomed, bizet, s, pretty, and, effective, work, but, compared, zelia, trebelli, s, interpretation, of, the, title, role, unfavourably, with, that, of, minnie, hauk, thereafter, carmen, was, quickly, incorporated, into, the, met, s, regular, repertory, in, february, 1906, enrico, caruso, sang, jos, at, the, met, for, the, first, time, he, continued, to, perform, in, this, role, until, 1919, two, years, before, his, death, on, 17, april, 1906, on, tour, with, the, met, he, sang, the, role, at, the, grand, opera, house, in, san, francisco, afterwards, he, sat, up, until, 3, am, reading, the, reviews, in, the, early, editions, of, the, following, day, s, papers, two, hours, later, he, was, awakened, by, the, first, violent, shocks, of, the, 1906, san, francisco, earthquake, after, which, he, and, his, fellow, performers, made, a, hurried, escape, from, the, palace, hotel, the, popularity, of, carmen, continued, through, succeeding, generations, of, american, opera, goers, by, the, beginning, of, 2011, the, met, alone, had, performed, it, almost, a, thousand, times, it, enjoyed, similar, success, in, other, american, cities, and, in, all, parts, of, the, world, in, many, different, languages, carmen, s, habanera, from, act, 1, and, the, toreador, s, song, votre, toast, from, act, 2, are, among, the, most, popular, and, best, known, of, all, operatic, arias, the, latter, a, splendid, piece, of, swagger, according, to, newman, against, which, the, voices, and, the, eyebrows, of, purists, have, long, been, raised, in, vain, most, of, the, productions, outside, france, followed, the, example, created, in, vienna, and, incorporated, lavish, ballet, interludes, and, other, spectacles, a, practice, which, mahler, abandoned, in, vienna, when, he, revived, the, work, there, in, 1900, in, 1919, bizet, s, aged, contemporary, camille, saint, sa, ns, was, still, complaining, about, the, strange, idea, of, adding, a, ballet, which, he, considered, a, hideous, blemish, in, that, masterpiece, and, he, wondered, why, bizet, s, wife, had, permitted, it, at, the, op, ra, comique, after, its, 1883, revival, carmen, was, always, presented, in, the, dialogue, version, with, minimal, musical, embellishments, by, 1888, the, year, of, the, 50th, anniversary, of, bizet, s, birth, the, opera, had, been, performed, there, 330, times, by, 1938, his, centenary, year, the, total, of, performances, at, the, theatre, had, reached, 2, 271, however, outside, france, the, practice, of, using, recitatives, remained, the, norm, for, many, years, the, carl, rosa, opera, company, s, 1947, london, production, and, walter, felsenstein, s, 1949, staging, at, the, berlin, komische, oper, are, among, the, first, known, instances, in, which, the, dialogue, version, was, used, other, than, in, france, neither, of, these, innovations, led, to, much, change, in, practice, a, similar, experiment, was, tried, at, covent, garden, in, 1953, but, hurriedly, withdrawn, and, the, first, american, production, with, spoken, dialogue, in, colorado, in, 1953, met, with, a, similar, fate, dean, has, commented, on, the, dramatic, distortions, that, arise, from, the, suppression, of, the, dialogue, the, effect, he, says, is, that, the, action, moves, forward, in, a, series, of, jerks, rather, instead, of, by, smooth, transition, and, that, most, of, the, minor, characters, are, substantially, diminished, only, late, in, the, 20th, century, did, dialogue, versions, become, common, in, opera, houses, outside, france, but, there, is, still, no, universally, recognised, full, score, fritz, oeser, s, 1964, edition, is, an, attempt, to, fill, this, gap, but, in, dean, s, view, is, unsatisfactory, oeser, reintroduces, material, removed, by, bizet, during, the, first, rehearsals, and, ignores, many, of, the, late, changes, and, improvements, that, the, composer, made, immediately, before, the, first, performance, he, thus, according, to, susan, mcclary, inadvertently, preserves, as, definitive, an, early, draft, of, the, opera, in, the, early, 21st, century, new, editions, were, prepared, by, robert, didion, and, richard, langham, smith, published, by, schott, and, peters, respectively, each, departs, significantly, from, bizet, s, vocal, score, of, march, 1875, published, during, his, lifetime, after, he, had, personally, corrected, the, proofs, dean, believes, this, vocal, score, should, be, the, basis, of, any, standard, edition, lesley, wright, a, contemporary, bizet, scholar, remarks, that, unlike, his, compatriots, rameau, and, debussy, bizet, has, not, been, accorded, a, critical, edition, of, his, principal, works, should, this, transpire, she, says, we, might, expect, yet, another, scholar, to, attempt, to, refine, the, details, of, this, vibrant, score, which, has, so, fascinated, the, public, and, performers, for, more, than, a, century, meanwhile, carmen, s, popularity, endures, according, to, macdonald, the, memorability, of, bizet, s, tunes, will, keep, the, music, of, carmen, alive, in, perpetuity, and, its, status, as, a, popular, classic, is, unchallenged, by, any, other, french, opera, herv, lacombe, in, his, survey, of, 19th, century, french, opera, contends, that, carmen, is, one, of, the, few, works, from, that, large, repertory, to, have, stood, the, test, of, time, while, he, places, the, opera, firmly, within, the, long, op, ra, comique, tradition, macdonald, considers, that, it, transcends, the, genre, and, that, its, immortality, is, assured, by, the, combination, in, abundance, of, striking, melody, deft, harmony, and, perfectly, judged, orchestration, dean, sees, bizet, s, principal, achievement, in, the, demonstration, of, the, main, actions, of, the, opera, in, the, music, rather, than, in, the, dialogue, writing, that, few, artists, have, expressed, so, vividly, the, torments, inflicted, by, sexual, passions, and, jealousy, dean, places, bizet, s, realism, in, a, different, category, from, the, verismo, of, puccini, and, others, he, likens, the, composer, to, mozart, and, verdi, in, his, ability, to, engage, his, audiences, with, the, emotions, and, sufferings, of, his, characters, bizet, who, had, never, visited, spain, sought, out, appropriate, ethnic, material, to, provide, an, authentic, spanish, flavour, to, his, music, carmen, s, habanera, is, based, on, an, idiomatic, song, el, arreglito, by, the, spanish, composer, sebasti, n, yradier, 1809, 65, bizet, had, taken, this, to, be, a, genuine, folk, melody, when, he, learned, its, recent, origin, he, added, a, note, to, the, vocal, score, crediting, yradier, he, used, a, genuine, folksong, as, the, source, of, carmen, s, defiant, coupe, moi, br, le, moi, while, other, parts, of, the, score, notably, the, seguidilla, utilise, the, rhythms, and, instrumentation, associated, with, flamenco, music, however, dean, insists, that, his, is, a, french, not, a, spanish, opera, the, foreign, bodies, while, they, undoubtedly, contribute, to, the, unique, atmosphere, of, the, opera, form, only, a, small, ingredient, of, the, complete, music, the, prelude, to, act, 1, combines, three, recurrent, themes, the, entry, of, the, bullfighters, from, act, 4, the, refrain, from, the, toreador, song, from, act, 2, and, the, motif, that, in, two, slightly, differing, forms, represents, both, carmen, herself, and, the, fate, she, personifies, this, motif, played, on, clarinet, bassoon, cornet, and, cellos, over, tremolo, strings, concludes, the, prelude, with, an, abrupt, crescendo, when, the, curtain, rises, a, light, and, sunny, atmosphere, is, soon, established, and, pervades, the, opening, scenes, the, mock, solemnities, of, the, changing, of, the, guard, and, the, flirtatious, exchanges, between, the, townsfolk, and, the, factory, girls, precede, a, mood, change, when, a, brief, phrase, from, the, fate, motif, announces, carmen, s, entrance, after, her, provocative, habanera, with, its, persistent, insidious, rhythm, and, changes, of, key, the, fate, motif, sounds, in, full, when, carmen, throws, her, flower, to, jos, before, departing, this, action, elicits, from, jos, a, passionate, a, major, solo, which, dean, suggests, is, the, turning, point, in, his, musical, characterisation, the, softer, vein, returns, briefly, as, mica, la, reappears, and, joins, with, jos, in, a, duet, to, a, warm, clarinet, and, strings, accompaniment, the, tranquillity, is, shattered, by, the, women, s, noisy, quarrel, carmen, s, dramatic, re, entry, and, her, defiant, interaction, with, zuniga, after, her, beguiling, seguidilla, provokes, jos, to, an, exasperated, high, a, sharp, shout, carmen, s, escape, is, preceded, by, the, brief, but, disconcerting, reprise, of, a, fragment, from, the, habanera, bizet, revised, this, finale, several, times, to, increase, its, dramatic, effect, act, 2, begins, with, a, short, prelude, based, on, a, melody, that, jos, will, sing, offstage, before, his, next, entry, a, festive, scene, in, the, inn, precedes, escamillo, s, tumultuous, entrance, in, which, brass, and, percussion, provide, prominent, backing, while, the, crowd, sings, along, the, quintet, that, follows, is, described, by, newman, as, of, incomparable, verve, and, musical, wit, jos, s, appearance, precipitates, a, long, mutual, wooing, scene, carmen, sings, dances, and, plays, the, castanets, a, distant, cornet, call, summoning, jos, to, duty, is, blended, with, carmen, s, melody, so, as, to, be, barely, discernible, a, muted, reference, to, the, fate, motif, on, an, english, horn, leads, to, jos, s, flower, song, a, flowing, continuous, melody, that, ends, pianissimo, on, a, sustained, high, b, flat, jos, s, insistence, that, despite, carmen, s, blandishments, he, must, return, to, duty, leads, to, a, quarrel, the, arrival, of, zuniga, the, consequent, fight, and, jos, s, unavoidable, ensnarement, into, the, lawless, life, culminates, musically, in, the, triumphant, hymn, to, freedom, that, closes, the, act, the, prelude, to, act, 3, was, originally, intended, for, bizet, s, l, arl, sienne, score, newman, describes, it, as, an, exquisite, miniature, with, much, dialoguing, and, intertwining, between, the, woodwind, instruments, as, the, action, unfolds, the, tension, between, carmen, and, jos, is, evident, in, the, music, in, the, card, scene, the, lively, duet, for, frasquita, and, merc, d, s, turns, ominous, when, carmen, intervenes, the, fate, motif, underlines, her, premonition, of, death, mica, la, s, aria, after, her, entry, in, search, of, jos, is, a, conventional, piece, though, of, deep, feeling, preceded, and, concluded, by, horn, calls, the, middle, part, of, the, act, is, occupied, by, escamillo, and, jos, now, acknowledged, as, rivals, for, carmen, s, favour, the, music, reflects, their, contrasting, attitudes, escamillo, remains, says, newman, invincibly, polite, and, ironic, while, jos, is, sullen, and, aggressive, when, mica, la, pleads, with, jos, to, go, with, her, to, his, mother, the, harshness, of, carmen, s, music, reveals, her, most, unsympathetic, side, as, jos, departs, vowing, to, return, the, fate, theme, is, heard, briefly, in, the, woodwind, the, confident, off, stage, sound, of, the, departing, escamillo, singing, the, toreador, s, refrain, provides, a, distinct, contrast, to, jos, s, increasing, desperation, the, final, act, is, prefaced, with, a, lively, orchestral, piece, derived, from, manuel, garc, a, s, short, operetta, el, criado, fingido, after, the, opening, crowd, scene, the, bullfighters, march, is, led, by, the, children, s, chorus, the, crowd, hails, escamillo, before, his, short, love, scene, with, carmen, the, long, finale, in, which, jos, makes, his, last, pleas, to, carmen, and, is, decisively, rejected, is, punctuated, at, critical, moments, by, enthusiastic, off, stage, shouts, from, the, bullfighting, arena, as, jos, kills, carmen, the, chorus, sing, the, refrain, of, the, toreador, song, off, stage, the, fate, motif, which, has, been, suggestively, present, at, various, points, during, the, act, is, heard, fortissimo, together, with, a, brief, reference, to, carmen, s, card, scene, music, jose, s, last, words, of, love, and, despair, are, followed, by,
