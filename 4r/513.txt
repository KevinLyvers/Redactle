conceptual, art, also, referred, to, as, conceptualism, is, art, in, which, the, concept, s, or, idea, s, involved, in, the, work, are, prioritized, equally, to, or, more, than, traditional, aesthetic, technical, and, material, concerns, some, works, of, conceptual, art, may, be, constructed, by, anyone, simply, by, following, a, set, of, written, instructions, this, method, was, fundamental, to, american, artist, sol, lewitt, s, definition, of, conceptual, art, one, of, the, first, to, appear, in, print, in, conceptual, art, the, idea, or, concept, is, the, most, important, aspect, of, the, work, when, an, artist, uses, a, conceptual, form, of, art, it, means, that, all, of, the, planning, and, decisions, are, made, beforehand, and, the, execution, is, a, perfunctory, affair, the, idea, becomes, a, machine, that, makes, the, art, tony, godfrey, author, of, conceptual, art, art, ideas, 1998, asserts, that, conceptual, art, questions, the, nature, of, art, a, notion, that, joseph, kosuth, elevated, to, a, definition, of, art, itself, in, his, seminal, early, manifesto, of, conceptual, art, art, after, philosophy, 1969, the, notion, that, art, should, examine, its, own, nature, was, already, a, potent, aspect, of, the, influential, art, critic, clement, greenberg, s, vision, of, modern, art, during, the, 1950s, with, the, emergence, of, an, exclusively, language, based, art, in, the, 1960s, however, conceptual, artists, such, as, art, language, joseph, kosuth, who, became, the, american, editor, of, art, language, and, lawrence, weiner, began, a, far, more, radical, interrogation, of, art, than, was, previously, possible, see, below, one, of, the, first, and, most, important, things, they, questioned, was, the, common, assumption, that, the, role, of, the, artist, was, to, create, special, kinds, of, material, objects, through, its, association, with, the, young, british, artists, and, the, turner, prize, during, the, 1990s, in, popular, usage, particularly, in, the, united, kingdom, conceptual, art, came, to, denote, all, contemporary, art, that, does, not, practice, the, traditional, skills, of, painting, and, sculpture, one, of, the, reasons, why, the, term, conceptual, art, has, come, to, be, associated, with, various, contemporary, practices, far, removed, from, its, original, aims, and, forms, lies, in, the, problem, of, defining, the, term, itself, as, the, artist, mel, bochner, suggested, as, early, as, 1970, in, explaining, why, he, does, not, like, the, epithet, conceptual, it, is, not, always, entirely, clear, what, concept, refers, to, and, it, runs, the, risk, of, being, confused, with, intention, thus, in, describing, or, defining, a, work, of, art, as, conceptual, it, is, important, not, to, confuse, what, is, referred, to, as, conceptual, with, an, artist, s, intention, the, french, artist, marcel, duchamp, paved, the, way, for, the, conceptualists, providing, them, with, examples, of, prototypically, conceptual, works, the, readymades, for, instance, the, most, famous, of, duchamp, s, readymades, was, fountain, 1917, a, standard, urinal, basin, signed, by, the, artist, with, the, pseudonym, r, mutt, and, submitted, for, inclusion, in, the, annual, un, juried, exhibition, of, the, society, of, independent, artists, in, new, york, which, rejected, it, the, artistic, tradition, does, not, see, a, commonplace, object, such, as, a, urinal, as, art, because, it, is, not, made, by, an, artist, or, with, any, intention, of, being, art, nor, is, it, unique, or, hand, crafted, duchamp, s, relevance, and, theoretical, importance, for, future, conceptualists, was, later, acknowledged, by, us, artist, joseph, kosuth, in, his, 1969, essay, art, after, philosophy, when, he, wrote, all, art, after, duchamp, is, conceptual, in, nature, because, art, only, exists, conceptually, in, 1956, the, founder, of, lettrism, isidore, isou, developed, the, notion, of, a, work, of, art, which, by, its, very, nature, could, never, be, created, in, reality, but, which, could, nevertheless, provide, aesthetic, rewards, by, being, contemplated, intellectually, this, concept, also, called, art, esthap, riste, or, infinite, aesthetics, derived, from, the, infinitesimals, of, gottfried, wilhelm, leibniz, quantities, which, could, not, actually, exist, except, conceptually, the, current, incarnation, as, of, 2013, of, the, isouian, movement, exco, rdism, self, defines, as, the, art, of, the, infinitely, large, and, the, infinitely, small, in, 1961, philosopher, and, artist, henry, flynt, coined, the, term, concept, art, in, an, article, bearing, the, same, name, which, appeared, in, the, proto, fluxus, publication, an, anthology, of, chance, operations, flynt, s, concept, art, he, maintained, devolved, from, his, notion, of, cognitive, nihilism, in, which, paradoxes, in, logic, are, shown, to, evacuate, concepts, of, substance, drawing, on, the, syntax, of, logic, and, mathematics, concept, art, was, meant, jointly, to, supersede, mathematics, and, the, formalistic, music, then, current, in, serious, art, music, circles, therefore, flynt, maintained, to, merit, the, label, concept, art, a, work, had, to, be, a, critique, of, logic, or, mathematics, in, which, a, linguistic, concept, was, the, material, a, quality, which, is, absent, from, subsequent, conceptual, art, the, term, assumed, a, different, meaning, when, employed, by, joseph, kosuth, and, by, the, english, art, and, language, group, who, discarded, the, conventional, art, object, in, favour, of, a, documented, critical, inquiry, that, began, in, art, language, the, journal, of, conceptual, art, in, 1969, into, the, artist, s, social, philosophical, and, psychological, status, by, the, mid, 1970s, they, had, produced, publications, indices, performances, texts, and, paintings, to, this, end, in, 1970, conceptual, art, and, conceptual, aspects, the, first, dedicated, conceptual, art, exhibition, took, place, at, the, new, york, cultural, center, conceptual, art, emerged, as, a, movement, during, the, 1960s, in, part, as, a, reaction, against, formalism, as, then, articulated, by, the, influential, new, york, art, critic, clement, greenberg, according, to, greenberg, modern, art, followed, a, process, of, progressive, reduction, and, refinement, toward, the, goal, of, defining, the, essential, formal, nature, of, each, medium, those, elements, that, ran, counter, to, this, nature, were, to, be, reduced, the, task, of, painting, for, example, was, to, define, precisely, what, kind, of, object, a, painting, truly, is, what, makes, it, a, painting, and, nothing, else, as, it, is, of, the, nature, of, paintings, to, be, flat, objects, with, canvas, surfaces, onto, which, colored, pigment, is, applied, such, things, as, figuration, 3, d, perspective, illusion, and, references, to, external, subject, matter, were, all, found, to, be, extraneous, to, the, essence, of, painting, and, ought, to, be, removed, some, have, argued, that, conceptual, art, continued, this, dematerialization, of, art, by, removing, the, need, for, objects, altogether, while, others, including, many, of, the, artists, themselves, saw, conceptual, art, as, a, radical, break, with, greenberg, s, kind, of, formalist, modernism, later, artists, continued, to, share, a, preference, for, art, to, be, self, critical, as, well, as, a, distaste, for, illusion, however, by, the, end, of, the, 1960s, it, was, certainly, clear, that, greenberg, s, stipulations, for, art, to, continue, within, the, confines, of, each, medium, and, to, exclude, external, subject, matter, no, longer, held, traction, conceptual, art, also, reacted, against, the, commodification, of, art, it, attempted, a, subversion, of, the, gallery, or, museum, as, the, location, and, determiner, of, art, and, the, art, market, as, the, owner, and, distributor, of, art, lawrence, weiner, said, once, you, know, about, a, work, of, mine, you, own, it, there, s, no, way, i, can, climb, inside, somebody, s, head, and, remove, it, many, conceptual, artists, work, can, therefore, only, be, known, about, through, documentation, which, is, manifested, by, it, e, g, photographs, written, texts, or, displayed, objects, which, some, might, argue, are, not, in, and, of, themselves, the, art, it, is, sometimes, as, in, the, work, of, robert, barry, yoko, ono, and, weiner, himself, reduced, to, a, set, of, written, instructions, describing, a, work, but, stopping, short, of, actually, making, it, emphasising, the, idea, as, more, important, than, the, artifact, this, reveals, an, explicit, preference, for, the, art, side, of, the, ostensible, dichotomy, between, art, and, craft, where, art, unlike, craft, takes, place, within, and, engages, historical, discourse, for, example, ono, s, written, instructions, make, more, sense, alongside, other, conceptual, art, of, the, time, language, was, a, central, concern, for, the, first, wave, of, conceptual, artists, of, the, 1960s, and, early, 1970s, although, the, utilisation, of, text, in, art, was, in, no, way, novel, only, in, the, 1960s, did, the, artists, lawrence, weiner, edward, ruscha, joseph, kosuth, robert, barry, and, art, language, begin, to, produce, art, by, exclusively, linguistic, means, where, previously, language, was, presented, as, one, kind, of, visual, element, alongside, others, and, subordinate, to, an, overarching, composition, e, g, synthetic, cubism, the, conceptual, artists, used, language, in, place, of, brush, and, canvas, and, allowed, it, to, signify, in, its, own, right, of, lawrence, weiner, s, works, anne, rorimer, writes, the, thematic, content, of, individual, works, derives, solely, from, the, import, of, the, language, employed, while, presentational, means, and, contextual, placement, play, crucial, yet, separate, roles, the, british, philosopher, and, theorist, of, conceptual, art, peter, osborne, suggests, that, among, the, many, factors, that, influenced, the, gravitation, toward, language, based, art, a, central, role, for, conceptualism, came, from, the, turn, to, linguistic, theories, of, meaning, in, both, anglo, american, analytic, philosophy, and, structuralist, and, post, structuralist, continental, philosophy, during, the, middle, of, the, twentieth, century, this, linguistic, turn, reinforced, and, legitimized, the, direction, the, conceptual, artists, took, osborne, also, notes, that, the, early, conceptualists, were, the, first, generation, of, artists, to, complete, degree, based, university, training, in, art, osborne, later, made, the, observation, that, contemporary, art, is, post, conceptual, in, a, public, lecture, delivered, at, the, fondazione, antonio, ratti, villa, sucota, in, como, on, july, 9, 2010, it, is, a, claim, made, at, the, level, of, the, ontology, of, the, work, of, art, rather, than, say, at, the, descriptive, level, of, style, or, movement, the, american, art, historian, edward, a, shanken, points, to, the, example, of, roy, ascott, who, powerfully, demonstrates, the, significant, intersections, between, conceptual, art, and, art, and, technology, exploding, the, conventional, autonomy, of, these, art, historical, categories, ascott, the, british, artist, most, closely, associated, with, cybernetic, art, in, england, was, not, included, in, cybernetic, serendipity, because, his, use, of, cybernetics, was, primarily, conceptual, and, did, not, explicitly, utilize, technology, conversely, although, his, essay, on, the, application, of, cybernetics, to, art, and, art, pedagogy, the, construction, of, change, 1964, was, quoted, on, the, dedication, page, to, sol, lewitt, of, lucy, r, lippard, s, seminal, six, years, the, dematerialization, of, the, art, object, from, 1966, to, 1972, ascott, s, anticipation, of, and, contribution, to, the, formation, of, conceptual, art, in, britain, has, received, scant, recognition, perhaps, and, ironically, because, his, work, was, too, closely, allied, with, art, and, technology, another, vital, intersection, was, explored, in, ascott, s, use, of, the, thesaurus, in, 1963, telematic, connections, timeline, which, drew, an, explicit, parallel, between, the, taxonomic, qualities, of, verbal, and, visual, languages, a, concept, that, would, be, taken, up, in, joseph, kosuth, s, second, investigation, proposition, 1, 1968, and, mel, ramsden, s, elements, of, an, incomplete, map, 1968, proto, conceptualism, has, roots, in, the, rise, of, modernism, with, for, example, manet, 1832, 1883, and, later, marcel, duchamp, 1887, 1968, the, first, wave, of, the, conceptual, art, movement, extended, from, approximately, 1967, to, 1978, early, concept, artists, like, henry, flynt, 1940, robert, morris, 1931, 2018, and, ray, johnson, 1927, 1995, influenced, the, later, widely, accepted, movement, of, conceptual, art, conceptual, artists, like, dan, graham, hans, haacke, and, lawrence, weiner, have, proven, very, influential, on, subsequent, artists, and, well, known, contemporary, artists, such, as, mike, kelley, or, tracey, emin, are, sometimes, labeled, second, or, third, generation, conceptualists, or, post, conceptual, artists, the, prefix, post, in, art, can, frequently, be, interpreted, as, because, of, contemporary, artists, have, taken, up, many, of, the, concerns, of, the, conceptual, art, movement, while, they, may, or, may, not, term, themselves, conceptual, artists, ideas, such, as, anti, commodification, social, and, or, political, critique, and, ideas, information, as, medium, continue, to, be, aspects, of, contemporary, art, especially, among, artists, working, with, installation, art, performance, art, art, intervention, net, art, and, electronic, digital, art, neo, conceptual, art, describes, art, practices, in, the, 1980s, and, particularly, 1990s, to, date, that, derive, from, the, conceptual, art, movement, of, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, these, subsequent, initiatives, have, included, the, moscow, conceptualists, united, states, neo, conceptualists, such, as, sherrie, levine, and, the, young, british, artists, notably, damien, hirst, and, tracey, emin, in, the, united, kingdom
