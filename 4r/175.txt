military, academy, and, college, the, catcher, in, the, rye, is, narrated, in, a, subjective, style, from, the, point, of, view, of, holden, caulfield, following, his, exact, thought, processes, there, is, flow, in, the, seemingly, disjointed, ideas, and, episodes, for, example, as, holden, sits, in, a, chair, in, his, dorm, minor, events, such, as, picking, up, a, book, or, looking, at, a, table, unfold, into, discussions, about, experiences, critical, reviews, affirm, that, the, novel, accurately, reflected, the, teenage, colloquial, speech, of, the, time, words, and, phrases, that, appear, frequently, include, bruce, brooks, held, that, holden, s, attitude, remains, unchanged, at, story, s, end, implying, no, maturation, thus, differentiating, the, novel, from, young, adult, fiction, in, contrast, louis, menand, thought, that, teachers, assign, the, novel, because, of, the, optimistic, ending, to, teach, adolescent, readers, that, alienation, is, just, a, phase, while, brooks, maintained, that, holden, acts, his, age, menand, claimed, that, holden, thinks, as, an, adult, given, his, ability, to, accurately, perceive, people, and, their, motives, others, highlight, the, dilemma, of, holden, s, state, in, between, adolescence, and, adulthood, holden, is, quick, to, become, emotional, i, felt, sorry, as, hell, for, is, a, phrase, he, often, uses, it, is, often, said, that, holden, changes, at, the, end, when, he, watches, phoebe, on, the, carousel, and, he, talks, about, the, golden, ring, and, how, it, s, good, for, kids, to, try, to, grab, it, peter, beidler, in, his, a, reader, s, companion, to, j, d, salinger, s, the, catcher, in, the, rye, identified, the, movie, that, the, prostitute, sunny, refers, to, in, chapter, 13, she, says, that, in, the, movie, a, boy, who, looked, like, holden, fell, off, a, boat, and, from, this, detail, beidler, deduced, that, the, movie, was, captains, courageous, 1937, with, the, boy, played, by, child,

subject, but, he, also, despises, hollywood, industry, based, movies, considering, them, the, ultimate, in, phony, as, the, writer, has, no, space, for, his, own, imagination, and, describes, d, b, s, move, to, hollywood, to, write, for, films, as, prostituting, himself, allie, wrote, poetry, on, his, baseball, glove, and, phoebe, is, a, diarist, this, catcher, in, the, rye, is, an, analogy, for, holden, who, admires, in, children, attributes, that, he, often, struggles, to, find, in, adults, like, innocence, kindness, spontaneity, and, generosity, falling, off, the, cliff, could, be, a, progression, into, the, adult, world, that, surrounds, him, and, that, he, strongly, criticizes, later, phoebe, and, holden, exchange, roles, as, the, catcher, and, the, fallen, he, gives, her, his, hunting, hat, the, catcher, s, symbol, and, becomes, the, fallen, as, phoebe, becomes, the, catcher, in, their, biography, of, salinger, david, shields, and, shane, salerno, argue, that, the, catcher, in, the, rye, can, best, be, understood, as, a, disguised, war, novel, salinger, witnessed, the, horrors, of, world, war, ii, but, rather, than, writing, a, combat, novel, salinger, according, to, shields, and, salerno, took, the, trauma, of, war, and, embedded, it, within, what, looked, to, the, naked, eye, like, a, coming, of, age, novel, the, catcher, in, the, rye, has, been, consistently, listed, as, one, of, the, best, novels, of, the, twentieth, century, shortly, after, its, publication, in, an, article, for, the, new, york, times, nash, k, burger, called, it, an, unusually, brilliant, novel, while, james, stern, wrote, an, admiring, review, of, the, book, in, a, voice, imitating, holden, s, george, h, w, bush, called, it, a, marvelous, book, listing, it, among, the, books, that, inspired, him, in, june, 2009, the, bbc, s, finlo, rohrer, wrote, that, 58, years, since, publication, the, book, is, still, regarded, as, the, defining, work, on, what, it, is, like, to, be, a, teenager, adam, gopnik, considers, it, one, of, the, three, perfect, books, in, american, literature, along, with, adventures, of, huckleberry, finn, and, the, great, gatsby, and, believes, that, no, book, has, ever, captured, a, city, better, than, catcher, in, the, rye, captured, new, york, in, the, fifties, in, an, appraisal, of, the, catcher, in, the, rye, written, after, the, death, of, j, d, salinger, jeff, pruchnic, says, the, novel, has, retained, its, appeal, for, many, generations, pruchnic, describes, holden, as, a, teenage, protagonist, frozen, midcentury, but, destined, to, be, discovered, by, those, of, a, similar, age, in, every, generation, to, come, bill, gates, said, that, the, catcher, in, the, rye, is, one, of, his, favorite, books, as, has, aaron, sorkin, not, all, reception, has, been, positive, the, book, has, had, its, share, of, naysayers, including, the, longtime, washington, post, book, critic, jonathan, yardley, who, in, 2004, wrote, that, the, experience, of, rereading, the, novel, after, several, decades, proved, to, be, a, painful, experience, the, combination, of, salinger, s, execrable, prose, and, caulfield, s, jejune, narcissism, produced, effects, comparable, to, mainlining, castor, oil, yardley, described, the, novel, as, among, the, worst, popular, books, in, the, annals, of, american, literature, why, yardley, asked, do, english, teachers, whose, responsibility, is, to, teach, good, writing, repeatedly, and, reflexively, require, students, to, read, a, book, as, badly, written, as, this, one, according, to, rohrer, many, contemporary, readers, as, yardley, found, just, cannot, understand, what, the, fuss, is, about, many, of, these, readers, are, disappointed, that, the, novel, fails, to, meet, the, expectations, generated, by, the, mystique, it, is, shrouded, in, j, d, salinger, has, done, his, part, to, enhance, this, mystique, that, is, to, say, he, has, done, nothing, rohrer, assessed, the, reasons, behind, both, the, popularity, and, criticism, of, the, book, saying, that, it, captures, existential, teenage, angst, and, has, a, complex, central, character, and, accessible, conversational, style, while, at, the, same, time, some, readers, may, dislike, the, use, of, 1940s, new, york, vernacular, and, the, excessive, whining, of, the, self, obsessed, character, in, 1960, a, teacher, in, tulsa, oklahoma, was, fired, for, assigning, the, novel, in, class, she, was, later, reinstated, between, 1961, and, 1982, the, catcher, in, the, rye, was, the, most, censored, book,

alleged, the, book, was, part, of, an, overall, communist, plot, this, ban, did, not, last, long, and, the, offended, board, members, were, immediately, recalled, and, removed, in, a, special, election, in, 1981, it, was, both, the, most, censored, book, and, the, second, most, taught, book, in, public, schools, in, the, united, states, according, to, the, american, library, association,

the, list, for, three, years, it, reappeared, in, the, list, of, most, challenged, books, of, 2009, the, challenges, generally, begin, with, holden, s, frequent, use, of, vulgar, language, other, reasons, include, sexual, references, blasphemy, undermining, of, family, values, and, moral, codes, encouragement, of, rebellion, and, promotion, of, drinking, smoking, lying, promiscuity, and, sexual, abuse, the, book, was, written, for, an, adult, audience, which, often, forms, the, foundation, of, many, challengers, arguments, against, it, often, the, challengers, have, been, unfamiliar, with, the, plot, itself, shelley, keller, gage, a, high, school, teacher, who, faced, objections, after, assigning, the, novel, in, her, class, noted, that, the, challengers, are, being, just, like, holden, they, are, trying, to, be, catchers, in, the, rye, censorship, of, the, book, often, causes, a, streisand, effect, as, such, incidents, cause, many, to, put, themselves, on, the, waiting, list, to, borrow, the, novel, where, there, was, no, waiting, list, before, several, shootings, have, been, associated, with, salinger, s, novel, including, robert, john, bardo, s, murder, of,

the, screen, in, 1949, a, critically, panned, film, version, of, his, short, story, uncle, wiggily, in, connecticut, was, released, renamed, my, foolish, heart, the, film, took, great, liberties, with, salinger, s, plot, and, is, widely, considered, to, be, among, the, reasons, that, salinger, refused, to, allow, any, subsequent, film, adaptations, of, his, work, the, enduring, success, of, the, catcher, in, the, rye, however, has, resulted, in, repeated, attempts, to, secure, the, novel, s, screen, rights, when, the, catcher, in, the, rye, was, first, released, many, offers, were, made, to, adapt, it, for, the, screen, including, one, from, samuel, goldwyn, producer, of, my, foolish, heart, in, a, letter, written, in, the, early, 1950s, salinger, spoke, of, mounting, a, play, in,

insurance, policy, it, pleasures, me, no, end, though, i, might, quickly, add, to, know, that, i, won, t, have, to, see, the, results, of, the, transaction, salinger, also, wrote, that, he, believed, his, novel, was, not, suitable, for, film, treatment, and, that, translating, holden, caulfield, s, first, person, narrative, into, voice, over, and, dialogue, would, be, contrived, in, 2020, don,

shepherds, most, likely, akin, to, oliver, company, the, idea, came, from, then, ceo, michael, eisner, who, loved, the, book, and, wanted, to, do, an, adaptation, after, being, told, that, j, d, salinger, would, not, agree, to, sell, the, film, rights, eisner, stated, well, let, s, just, do, that, kind, of, story, that, kind, of, growing, up, coming, of, age, story, in, 2009, the, year,

call, me, an, ignorant, swede, but, the, last, thing, i, thought, possible, in, the, u, s, was, that, you, banned, books, the, issue, is, complicated, by, the, nature, of, colting, s, book, 60, years, later, coming, through, the, rye, which, has, been, compared, to, fan, fiction, although, commonly, not, authorized, by, writers, no, legal, action, is, usually, taken, against, fan, fiction, since, it, is, rarely, published, commercially, and, thus, involves, no, profit
