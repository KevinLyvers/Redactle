of, sergei, diaghilev, s, ballets, russes, company, the, original, choreography, was, by, vaslav, nijinsky, with, stage, designs, and, costumes, by, nicholas, roerich, when, first, performed, at, the, th, tre, des, champs, lys, es, on, 29, may, 1913, the, avant, garde, nature, of, the, music, and, choreography, caused, a, sensation, many, have, called, the, first, night, reaction, a, riot, or, near, riot, though, this, wording, did, not, come, about, until, reviews, of, later, performances, in, 1924, over, a, decade, later, although, designed, as, a, work, for, the, stage, with, specific, passages, accompanying, characters, and, action, the, music, achieved, equal, if, not, greater, recognition, as, a, concert, piece, and, is, widely, considered, to, be, one, of, the, most, influential, musical, works, of, the, 20th, century, stravinsky, was, a, young, virtually, unknown, composer, when, diaghilev, recruited, him, to, create, works, for, the, ballets, russes, le, sacre, du, printemps, was, the, third, such, major, project, after, the, acclaimed, firebird, 1910, and, petrushka, 1911, the, concept, behind, the, rite, of, spring, developed, by, roerich, from, stravinsky, s, outline, idea, is, suggested, by, its, subtitle, pictures, of, pagan, russia, in, two, parts, the, scenario, depicts, various, primitive, rituals, celebrating, the, advent, of, spring, after, which, a, young, girl, is, chosen, as, a, sacrificial, victim, and, dances, herself, to, death, after, a, mixed, critical, reception, for, its, original, run, and, a, short, london, tour, the, ballet, was, not, performed, again, until, the, 1920s, when, a, version, choreographed, by, l, onide, massine, replaced, nijinsky, s, original, which, saw, only, eight, performances, massine, s, was, the, forerunner, of, many, innovative, productions, directed, by, the, world, s, leading, choreographers, gaining, the, work, worldwide, acceptance, in, the, 1980s, nijinsky, s, original, choreography, long, believed, lost, was, reconstructed, by, the, joffrey, ballet, in, los, angeles, stravinsky, s, score, contains, many, novel, features, for, its, time, including, experiments, in, tonality, metre, rhythm, stress, and, dissonance, analysts, have, noted, in, the, score, a, significant, grounding, in, russian, folk, music, a, relationship, stravinsky, tended, to, deny, regarded, as, among, the, first, modernist, works, the, music, influenced, many, of, the, 20th, century, s, leading, composers, and, is, one, of, the, most, recorded, works, in, the, classical, repertoire, igor, stravinsky, was, the, son, of, fyodor, stravinsky, the, principal, bass, singer, at, the, imperial, opera, saint, petersburg, and, anna, n, e, kholodovskaya, a, competent, amateur, singer, and, pianist, from, an, old, established, russian, family, fyodor, s, association, with, many, of, the, leading, figures, in, russian, music, including, rimsky, korsakov, borodin, and, mussorgsky, meant, that, igor, grew, up, in, an, intensely, musical, home, in, 1901, stravinsky, began, to, study, law, at, saint, petersburg, university, while, taking, private, lessons, in, harmony, and, counterpoint, stravinsky, worked, under, the, guidance, of, rimsky, korsakov, having, impressed, him, with, some, of, his, early, compositional, efforts, by, the, time, of, his, mentor, s, death, in, 1908, stravinsky, had, produced, several, works, among, them, a, piano, sonata, in, f, minor, 1903, 04, a, symphony, in, e, major, 1907, which, he, catalogued, as, opus, 1, and, a, short, orchestral, piece, feu, d, artifice, fireworks, composed, in, 1908, in, 1909, feu, d, artifice, was, performed, at, a, concert, in, saint, petersburg, among, those, in, the, audience, was, the, impresario, sergei, diaghilev, who, at, that, time, was, planning, to, introduce, russian, music, and, art, to, western, audiences, like, stravinsky, diaghilev, had, initially, studied, law, but, had, gravitated, via, journalism, into, the, theatrical, world, in, 1907, he, began, his, theatrical, career, by, presenting, five, concerts, in, paris, in, the, following, year, he, introduced, mussorgsky, s, opera, boris, godunov, in, 1909, still, in, paris, he, launched, the, ballets, russes, initially, with, borodin, s, polovtsian, dances, from, prince, igor, and, rimsky, korsakov, s, scheherazade, to, present, these, works, diaghilev, recruited, the, choreographer, michel, fokine, the, designer, l, on, bakst, and, the, dancer, vaslav, nijinsky, diaghilev, s, intention, however, was, to, produce, new, works, in, a, distinctively, 20th, century, style, and, he, was, looking, for, fresh, compositional, talent, having, heard, feu, d, artifice, he, approached, stravinsky, initially, with, a, request, for, help, in, orchestrating, music, by, chopin, to, create, new, arrangements, for, the, ballet, les, sylphides, stravinsky, worked, on, the, opening, nocturne, in, a, flat, major, and, the, closing, grande, valse, brillante, his, reward, was, a, much, bigger, commission, to, write, the, music, for, a, new, ballet, the, firebird, l, oiseau, de, feu, for, the, 1910, season, stravinsky, worked, through, the, winter, of, 1909, 10, in, close, association, with, fokine, who, was, choreographing, the, firebird, during, this, period, stravinsky, made, the, acquaintance, of, nijinsky, who, although, not, dancing, in, the, ballet, was, a, keen, observer, of, its, development, stravinsky, was, uncomplimentary, when, recording, his, first, impressions, of, the, dancer, observing, that, he, seemed, immature, and, gauche, for, his, age, he, was, 21, on, the, other, hand, stravinsky, found, diaghilev, an, inspiration, the, very, essence, of, a, great, personality, the, firebird, was, premiered, on, 25, june, 1910, with, tamara, karsavina, in, the, main, role, and, was, a, great, public, success, this, ensured, that, the, diaghilev, stravinsky, collaboration, would, continue, in, the, first, instance, with, petrushka, 1911, and, then, the, rite, of, spring, in, a, note, to, the, conductor, serge, koussevitzky, in, february, 1914, stravinsky, described, le, sacre, du, printemps, as, a, musical, choreographic, work, pagan, russia, unified, by, a, single, idea, the, mystery, and, great, surge, of, the, creative, power, of, spring, in, his, analysis, of, the, rite, pieter, van, den, toorn, writes, that, the, work, lacks, a, specific, plot, or, narrative, and, should, be, considered, as, a, succession, of, choreographed, episodes, the, french, titles, are, given, in, the, form, as, written, in, the, four, part, piano, score, published, in, 1913, there, have, been, numerous, variants, of, the, english, translations, those, shown, are, from, the, 1967, edition, of, the, score, lawrence, morton, in, a, study, of, the, origins, of, the, rite, records, that, in, 1907, 08, stravinsky, set, to, music, two, poems, from, sergey, gorodetsky, s, collection, yar, another, poem, in, the, anthology, which, stravinsky, did, not, set, but, is, likely, to, have, read, is, yarila, which, morton, observes, contains, many, of, the, basic, elements, from, which, the, rite, of, spring, developed, including, pagan, rites, sage, elders, and, the, propitiatory, sacrifice, of, a, young, maiden, the, likeness, is, too, close, to, be, coincidental, stravinsky, himself, gave, contradictory, accounts, of, the, genesis, of, the, rite, in, a, 1920, article, he, stressed, that, the, musical, ideas, had, come, first, that, the, pagan, setting, had, been, suggested, by, the, music, rather, than, the, other, way, round, however, in, his, 1936, autobiography, he, described, the, origin, of, the, work, thus, one, day, when, i, was, finishing, the, last, pages, of, l, oiseau, de, feu, in, saint, petersburg, i, had, a, fleeting, vision, i, saw, in, my, imagination, a, solemn, pagan, rite, sage, elders, seated, in, a, circle, watching, a, young, girl, dance, herself, to, death, they, were, sacrificing, her, to, propitiate, the, god, of, spring, such, was, the, theme, of, the, sacre, du, printemps, by, may, 1910, stravinsky, was, discussing, his, idea, with, nicholas, roerich, the, foremost, russian, expert, on, folk, art, and, ancient, rituals, roerich, had, a, reputation, as, an, artist, and, mystic, and, had, provided, the, stage, designs, for, diaghilev, s, 1909, production, of, the, polovtsian, dances, the, pair, quickly, agreed, on, a, working, title, the, great, sacrifice, russian, velikaia, zhertva, diaghilev, gave, his, blessing, to, the, work, although, the, collaboration, was, put, on, hold, for, a, year, while, stravinsky, was, occupied, with, his, second, major, commission, for, diaghilev, the, ballet, petrushka, in, july, 1911, stravinsky, visited, talashkino, near, smolensk, where, roerich, was, staying, with, the, princess, maria, tenisheva, a, noted, patron, of, the, arts, and, a, sponsor, of, diaghilev, s, magazine, world, of, art, here, over, several, days, stravinsky, and, roerich, finalised, the, structure, of, the, ballet, thomas, f, kelly, in, his, history, of, the, rite, premiere, suggests, that, the, two, part, pagan, scenario, that, emerged, was, primarily, devised, by, roerich, stravinsky, later, explained, to, nikolai, findeyzen, the, editor, of, the, russian, musical, gazette, that, the, first, part, of, the, work, would, be, called, the, kiss, of, the, earth, and, would, consist, of, games, and, ritual, dances, interrupted, by, a, procession, of, sages, culminating, in, a, frenzied, dance, as, the, people, embraced, the, spring, part, two, the, sacrifice, would, have, a, darker, aspect, secret, night, games, of, maidens, leading, to, the, choice, of, one, for, sacrifice, and, her, eventual, dance, to, the, death, before, the, sages, the, original, working, title, was, changed, to, holy, spring, russian, vesna, sviashchennaia, but, the, work, became, generally, known, by, the, french, translation, le, sacre, du, printemps, or, its, english, equivalent, the, rite, of, spring, with, the, subtitle, pictures, of, pagan, russia, stravinsky, s, sketchbooks, show, that, after, returning, to, his, home, at, ustilug, in, ukraine, in, september, 1911, he, worked, on, two, movements, the, augurs, of, spring, and, the, spring, rounds, in, october, he, left, ustilug, for, clarens, in, switzerland, where, in, a, tiny, and, sparsely, furnished, room, an, 8, by, 8, foot, 2, 4, by, 2, 4, m, closet, with, only, a, muted, upright, piano, a, table, and, two, chairs, he, worked, throughout, the, 1911, 12, winter, on, the, score, by, march, 1912, according, to, the, sketchbook, chronology, stravinsky, had, completed, part, i, and, had, drafted, much, of, part, ii, he, also, prepared, a, two, hand, piano, version, subsequently, lost, which, he, may, have, used, to, demonstrate, the, work, to, diaghilev, and, the, ballets, russes, conductor, pierre, monteux, in, april, 1912, he, also, made, a, four, hand, piano, arrangement, which, became, the, first, published, version, of, le, sacre, he, and, the, composer, claude, debussy, played, the, first, half, of, this, together, in, june, 1912, following, diaghilev, s, decision, to, delay, the, premiere, until, 1913, stravinsky, put, the, rite, aside, during, the, summer, of, 1912, he, enjoyed, the, paris, season, and, accompanied, diaghilev, to, the, bayreuth, festival, to, attend, a, performance, of, parsifal, stravinsky, resumed, work, on, the, rite, in, the, autumn, the, sketchbooks, indicate, that, he, had, finished, the, outline, of, the, final, sacrificial, dance, on, 17, november, 1912, during, the, remaining, months, of, winter, he, worked, on, the, full, orchestral, score, which, he, signed, and, dated, as, completed, in, clarens, march, 8, 1913, he, showed, the, manuscript, to, maurice, ravel, who, was, enthusiastic, and, predicted, in, a, letter, to, a, friend, that, the, first, performance, of, le, sacre, would, be, as, important, as, the, 1902, premiere, of, debussy, s, pell, as, et, m, lisande, after, the, orchestral, rehearsals, began, in, late, march, monteux, drew, the, composer, s, attention, to, several, passages, which, were, causing, problems, inaudible, horns, a, flute, solo, drowned, out, by, brass, and, strings, and, multiple, problems, with, the, balance, among, instruments, in, the, brass, section, during, fortissimo, episodes, stravinsky, amended, these, passages, and, as, late, as, april, was, still, revising, and, rewriting, the, final, bars, of, the, sacrificial, dance, revision, of, the, score, did, not, end, with, the, version, prepared, for, the, 1913, premiere, rather, stravinsky, continued, to, make, changes, for, the, next, 30, years, or, more, according, to, van, den, toorn, o, other, work, of, stravinsky, s, underwent, such, a, series, of, post, premiere, revisions, stravinsky, acknowledged, that, the, work, s, opening, bassoon, melody, was, derived, from, an, anthology, of, lithuanian, folk, songs, but, maintained, that, this, was, his, only, borrowing, from, such, sources, if, other, elements, sounded, like, aboriginal, folk, music, he, said, it, was, due, to, some, unconscious, folk, memory, however, morton, has, identified, several, more, melodies, in, part, i, as, having, their, origins, in, the, lithuanian, collection, more, recently, richard, taruskin, discovered, in, the, score, an, adapted, tune, from, one, of, rimsky, korsakov, s, one, hundred, russian, national, songs, taruskin, notes, the, paradox, whereby, the, rite, generally, acknowledged, as, the, most, revolutionary, of, the, composer, s, early, works, is, in, fact, rooted, in, the, traditions, of, russian, music, taruskin, has, listed, a, number, of, sources, that, roerich, consulted, when, creating, his, designs, among, these, are, the, primary, chronicle, a, 12th, century, compendium, of, early, pagan, customs, and, alexander, afanasyev, s, study, of, peasant, folklore, and, pagan, prehistory, the, princess, tenisheva, s, collection, of, costumes, was, an, early, source, of, inspiration, when, the, designs, were, complete, stravinsky, expressed, delight, and, declared, them, a, real, miracle, stravinsky, s, relationship, with, his, other, main, collaborator, nijinsky, was, more, complicated, diaghilev, had, decided, that, nijinsky, s, genius, as, a, dancer, would, translate, into, the, role, of, choreographer, and, ballet, master, he, was, not, dissuaded, when, nijinsky, s, first, attempt, at, choreography, debussy, s, l, apr, s, midi, d, un, faune, caused, controversy, and, near, scandal, because, of, the, dancer, s, novel, stylised, movements, and, his, overtly, sexual, gesture, at, the, work, s, end, it, is, apparent, from, contemporary, correspondence, that, at, least, initially, stravinsky, viewed, nijinsky, s, talents, as, a, choreographer, with, approval, a, letter, he, sent, to, findeyzen, praises, the, dancer, s, passionate, zeal, and, complete, self, effacement, however, in, his, 1936, memoirs, stravinsky, writes, that, the, decision, to, employ, nijinsky, in, this, role, filled, him, with, apprehension, although, he, admired, nijinsky, as, a, dancer, he, had, no, confidence, in, him, as, a, choreographer, the, poor, boy, knew, nothing, of, music, he, could, neither, read, it, nor, play, any, instrument, later, still, stravinsky, would, ridicule, nijinsky, s, dancing, maidens, as, knock, kneed, and, long, braided, lolitas, stravinsky, s, autobiographical, account, refers, to, many, painful, incidents, between, the, choreographer, and, the, dancers, during, the, rehearsal, period, by, the, beginning, of, 1913, when, nijinsky, was, badly, behind, schedule, stravinsky, was, warned, by, diaghilev, that, unless, you, come, here, immediately, the, sacre, will, not, take, place, the, problems, were, slowly, overcome, and, when, the, final, rehearsals, were, held, in, may, 1913, the, dancers, appeared, to, have, mastered, the, work, s, difficulties, even, the, ballets, russes, s, sceptical, stage, director, serge, grigoriev, was, full, of, praise, for, the, originality, and, dynamism, of, nijinsky, s, choreography, the, conductor, pierre, monteux, had, worked, with, diaghilev, since, 1911, and, had, been, in, charge, of, the, orchestra, at, the, premiere, of, petrushka, monteux, s, first, reaction, to, the, rite, after, hearing, stravinsky, play, a, piano, version, was, to, leave, the, room, and, find, a, quiet, corner, he, drew, diaghilev, aside, and, said, he, would, never, conduct, music, like, that, diaghilev, managed, to, change, his, mind, although, he, would, perform, his, duties, with, conscientious, professionalism, he, never, came, to, enjoy, the, work, nearly, fifty, years, after, the, premiere, he, told, enquirers, that, he, detested, it, in, old, age, he, said, to, sir, thomas, beecham, s, biographer, charles, reid, i, did, not, like, le, sacre, then, i, have, conducted, it, fifty, times, since, i, do, not, like, it, now, on, 30, march, monteux, informed, stravinsky, of, modifications, he, thought, were, necessary, to, the, score, all, of, which, the, composer, implemented, the, orchestra, drawn, mainly, from, the, concerts, colonne, in, paris, comprised, 99, players, much, larger, than, normally, employed, at, the, theatre, and, had, difficulty, fitting, into, the, orchestra, pit, after, the, first, part, of, the, ballet, received, two, full, orchestral, rehearsals, in, march, monteux, and, the, company, departed, to, perform, in, monte, carlo, rehearsals, resumed, when, they, returned, the, unusually, large, number, of, rehearsals, seventeen, solely, orchestral, and, five, with, the, dancers, were, fit, into, the, fortnight, before, the, opening, after, stravinsky, s, arrival, in, paris, on, 13, may, the, music, contained, so, many, unusual, note, combinations, that, monteux, had, to, ask, the, musicians, to, stop, interrupting, when, they, thought, they, had, found, mistakes, in, the, score, saying, he, would, tell, them, if, something, was, played, incorrectly, according, to, doris, monteux, the, musicians, thought, it, absolutely, crazy, at, one, point, a, climactic, brass, fortissimo, the, orchestra, broke, into, nervous, laughter, at, the, sound, causing, stravinsky, to, intervene, angrily, the, role, of, the, sacrificial, victim, was, to, have, been, danced, by, nijinsky, s, sister, bronislava, nijinska, when, she, became, pregnant, during, rehearsals, she, was, replaced, by, the, then, relatively, unknown, maria, piltz, paris, s, th, tre, des, champs, lys, es, was, a, new, structure, which, had, opened, on, 2, april, 1913, with, a, programme, celebrating, the, works, of, many, of, the, leading, composers, of, the, day, the, theatre, s, manager, gabriel, astruc, was, determined, to, house, the, 1913, ballets, russes, season, and, paid, diaghilev, the, large, sum, of, 25, 000, francs, per, performance, double, what, he, had, paid, the, previous, year, the, programme, for, 29, may, 1913, as, well, as, the, stravinsky, premiere, included, les, sylphides, weber, s, le, spectre, de, la, rose, and, borodin, s, polovtsian, dances, ticket, sales, for, the, evening, ticket, prices, being, doubled, for, a, premiere, amounted, to, 35, 000, francs, a, dress, rehearsal, was, held, in, the, presence, of, members, of, the, press, and, assorted, invited, guests, according, to, stravinsky, all, went, peacefully, however, the, critic, of, l, cho, de, paris, adolphe, boschot, foresaw, possible, trouble, he, wondered, how, the, public, would, receive, the, work, and, suggested, that, they, might, react, badly, if, they, thought, they, were, being, mocked, on, the, evening, of, 29, may, gustav, linor, reported, never, has, the, hall, been, so, full, or, so, resplendent, the, stairways, and, the, corridors, were, crowded, with, spectators, eager, to, see, and, to, hear, the, evening, began, with, les, sylphides, in, which, nijinsky, and, karsavina, danced, the, main, roles, le, sacre, followed, some, eyewitnesses, and, commentators, said, that, the, disturbances, in, the, audience, began, during, the, introduction, and, grew, noisier, when, the, curtain, rose, on, the, stamping, dancers, in, augurs, of, spring, but, taruskin, asserts, it, was, not, stravinsky, s, music, that, did, the, shocking, it, was, the, ugly, earthbound, lurching, and, stomping, devised, by, vaslav, nijinsky, marie, rambert, who, was, working, as, an, assistant, to, nijinsky, recalled, later, that, it, was, soon, impossible, to, hear, the, music, on, the, stage, in, his, autobiography, stravinsky, writes, that, the, derisive, laughter, that, greeted, the, first, bars, of, the, introduction, disgusted, him, and, that, he, left, the, auditorium, to, watch, the, rest, of, the, performance, from, the, stage, wings, the, demonstrations, he, says, grew, into, a, terrific, uproar, which, along, with, the, on, stage, noises, drowned, out, the, voice, of, nijinsky, who, was, shouting, the, step, numbers, to, the, dancers, two, years, after, the, premiere, the, journalist, and, photographer, carl, van, vechten, claimed, in, his, book, music, after, the, great, war, that, the, person, behind, him, became, carried, away, with, excitement, and, began, to, beat, rhythmically, on, top, of, my, head, with, his, fists, in, 1916, in, a, letter, not, published, until, 2013, van, vechten, admitted, he, had, actually, attended, the, second, night, among, other, changes, of, fact, at, that, time, a, parisian, ballet, audience, typically, consisted, of, two, diverse, groups, the, wealthy, and, fashionable, set, who, would, be, expecting, to, see, a, traditional, performance, with, beautiful, music, and, a, bohemian, group, who, the, poet, philosopher, jean, cocteau, asserted, would, acclaim, right, or, wrong, anything, that, is, new, because, of, their, hatred, of, the, boxes, monteux, believed, that, the, trouble, began, when, the, two, factions, began, attacking, each, other, but, their, mutual, anger, was, soon, diverted, towards, the, orchestra, everything, available, was, tossed, in, our, direction, but, we, continued, to, play, on, around, forty, of, the, worst, offenders, were, ejected, possibly, with, the, intervention, of, the, police, although, this, is, uncorroborated, through, all, the, disturbances, the, performance, continued, without, interruption, the, unrest, receded, significantly, during, part, ii, and, by, some, accounts, maria, piltz, s, rendering, of, the, final, sacrificial, dance, was, watched, in, reasonable, silence, at, the, end, there, were, several, curtain, calls, for, the, dancers, for, monteux, and, the, orchestra, and, for, stravinsky, and, nijinsky, before, the, evening, s, programme, continued, among, the, more, hostile, press, reviews, was, that, of, le, figaro, s, critic, henri, quittard, who, called, the, work, a, laborious, and, puerile, barbarity, and, added, we, are, sorry, to, see, an, artist, such, as, m, stravinsky, involve, himself, in, this, disconcerting, adventure, on, the, other, hand, gustav, linor, writing, in, the, leading, theatrical, magazine, com, dia, thought, the, performance, was, superb, especially, that, of, maria, piltz, the, disturbances, while, deplorable, were, merely, a, rowdy, debate, between, two, ill, mannered, factions, emile, raudin, of, les, marges, who, had, barely, heard, the, music, wrote, couldn, t, we, ask, m, astruc, to, set, aside, one, performance, for, well, intentioned, spectators, we, could, at, least, propose, to, evict, the, female, element, the, composer, alfredo, casella, thought, that, the, demonstrations, were, aimed, at, nijinsky, s, choreography, rather, than, at, the, music, a, view, shared, by, the, critic, michel, dimitri, calvocoressi, who, wrote, the, idea, was, excellent, but, was, not, successfully, carried, out, calvocoressi, failed, to, observe, any, direct, hostility, to, the, composer, unlike, he, said, the, premiere, of, debussy, s, pell, as, et, m, lisande, in, 1902, of, later, reports, that, the, veteran, composer, camille, saint, sa, ns, had, stormed, out, of, the, premiere, stravinsky, observed, that, this, was, impossible, saint, sa, ns, did, not, attend, stravinsky, also, rejected, cocteau, s, story, that, after, the, performance, stravinsky, nijinsky, diaghilev, and, cocteau, himself, took, a, cab, to, the, bois, de, boulogne, where, a, tearful, diaghilev, recited, poems, by, pushkin, stravinsky, merely, recalled, a, celebratory, dinner, with, diaghilev, and, nijinsky, at, which, the, impresario, expressed, his, entire, satisfaction, with, the, outcome, to, maximilien, steinberg, a, former, fellow, pupil, under, rimsky, korsakov, stravinsky, wrote, that, nijinsky, s, choreography, had, been, incomparable, with, the, exception, of, a, few, places, everything, was, as, i, wanted, it, the, premiere, was, followed, by, five, further, performances, of, le, sacre, du, printemps, at, the, th, tre, des, champs, lys, es, the, last, on, 13, june, although, these, occasions, were, relatively, peaceful, something, of, the, mood, of, the, first, night, remained, the, composer, giacomo, puccini, who, attended, the, second, performance, on, 2, june, described, the, choreography, as, ridiculous, and, the, music, cacophonous, the, work, of, a, madman, the, public, hissed, laughed, and, applauded, stravinsky, confined, to, his, bed, by, typhoid, fever, did, not, join, the, company, when, it, went, to, london, for, four, performances, at, the, theatre, royal, drury, lane, reviewing, the, london, production, the, times, critic, was, impressed, how, different, elements, of, the, work, came, together, to, form, a, coherent, whole, but, was, less, enthusiastic, about, the, music, itself, opining, that, stravinsky, had, entirely, sacrificed, melody, and, harmony, for, rhythm, if, m, stravinsky, had, wished, to, be, really, primitive, he, would, have, been, wise, to, score, his, ballet, for, nothing, but, drums, the, ballet, historian, cyril, beaumont, commented, on, the, slow, uncouth, movements, of, the, dancers, finding, these, in, complete, opposition, to, the, traditions, of, classical, ballet, after, the, opening, paris, run, and, the, london, performances, events, conspired, to, prevent, further, stagings, of, the, ballet, nijinsky, s, choreography, which, kelly, describes, as, so, striking, so, outrageous, so, frail, as, to, its, preservation, did, not, appear, again, until, attempts, were, made, to, reconstruct, it, in, the, 1980s, on, 19, september, 1913, nijinsky, married, romola, de, pulszky, while, the, ballets, russes, was, on, tour, without, diaghilev, in, south, america, when, diaghilev, found, out, he, was, distraught, and, furious, that, his, lover, had, married, and, dismissed, nijinsky, diaghilev, was, then, obliged, to, re, hire, fokine, who, had, resigned, in, 1912, because, nijinsky, had, been, asked, to, choreograph, faune, fokine, made, it, a, condition, of, his, re, employment, that, none, of, nijinsky, s, choreography, would, be, performed, in, a, letter, to, the, art, critic, and, historian, alexandre, benois, stravinsky, wrote, he, possibility, has, gone, for, some, time, of, seeing, anything, valuable, in, the, field, of, dance, and, still, more, important, of, again, seeing, this, offspring, of, mine, with, the, disruption, following, the, outbreak, of, the, first, world, war, in, august, 1914, and, the, dispersal, of, many, artistes, diaghilev, was, ready, to, re, engage, nijinsky, as, both, dancer, and, choreographer, but, nijinsky, had, been, placed, under, house, arrest, in, hungary, as, an, enemy, russian, citizen, diaghilev, negotiated, his, release, in, 1916, for, a, tour, in, the, united, states, but, the, dancer, s, mental, health, steadily, declined, and, he, took, no, further, part, in, professional, ballet, after, 1917, in, 1920, when, diaghilev, decided, to, revive, the, rite, he, found, that, no, one, now, remembered, the, choreography, after, spending, most, of, the, war, years, in, switzerland, and, becoming, a, permanent, exile, from, his, homeland, after, the, 1917, russian, revolution, stravinsky, resumed, his, partnership, with, diaghilev, when, the, war, ended, in, december, 1920, ernest, ansermet, conducted, a, new, production, in, paris, choreographed, by, l, onide, massine, with, the, nicholas, roerich, designs, retained, the, lead, dancer, was, lydia, sokolova, in, his, memoirs, stravinsky, is, equivocal, about, the, massine, production, the, young, choreographer, he, writes, showed, unquestionable, talent, but, there, was, something, forced, and, artificial, in, his, choreography, which, lacked, the, necessary, organic, relationship, with, the, music, sokolova, in, her, later, account, recalled, some, of, the, tensions, surrounding, the, production, with, stravinsky, wearing, an, expression, that, would, have, frightened, a, hundred, chosen, virgins, pranc, up, and, down, the, centre, aisle, while, ansermet, rehearsed, the, orchestra, the, ballet, was, first, shown, in, the, united, states, on, 11, april, 1930, when, massine, s, 1920, version, was, performed, by, the, philadelphia, orchestra, in, philadelphia, under, leopold, stokowski, with, martha, graham, dancing, the, role, of, the, chosen, one, the, production, moved, to, new, york, where, massine, was, relieved, to, find, the, audiences, receptive, a, sign, he, thought, that, new, yorkers, were, finally, beginning, to, take, ballet, seriously, the, first, american, designed, production, in, 1937, was, that, of, the, modern, dance, exponent, lester, horton, whose, version, replaced, the, original, pagan, russian, setting, with, a, wild, west, background, and, the, use, of, native, american, dances, in, 1944, massine, began, a, new, collaboration, with, roerich, who, before, his, death, in, 1947, completed, a, number, of, sketches, for, a, new, production, which, massine, brought, to, fruition, at, la, scala, in, milan, in, 1948, this, heralded, a, number, of, significant, post, war, european, productions, mary, wigman, in, berlin, 1957, followed, horton, in, highlighting, the, erotic, aspects, of, virgin, sacrifice, as, did, maurice, b, jart, in, brussels, 1959, b, jart, s, representation, replaced, the, culminating, sacrifice, with, a, depiction, of, what, the, critic, robert, johnson, describes, as, ceremonial, coitus, the, royal, ballet, s, 1962, production, choreographed, by, kenneth, macmillan, and, designed, by, sidney, nolan, was, first, performed, on, 3, may, and, was, a, critical, triumph, it, has, remained, in, the, company, s, repertoire, for, more, than, 50, years, after, its, revival, in, may, 2011, the, daily, telegraph, s, critic, mark, monahan, called, it, one, of, the, royal, ballet, s, greatest, achievements, moscow, first, saw, the, rite, in, 1965, in, a, version, choreographed, for, the, bolshoi, ballet, by, natalia, kasatkina, and, vladimir, vasiliev, this, production, was, shown, in, leningrad, four, years, later, at, the, maly, opera, theatre, and, introduced, a, storyline, that, provided, the, chosen, one, with, a, lover, who, wreaks, vengeance, on, the, elders, after, the, sacrifice, johnson, describes, the, production, as, a, product, of, state, atheism, soviet, propaganda, at, its, best, in, 1975, modern, dance, choreographer, pina, bausch, who, transformed, the, ballett, der, wuppertaler, b, hnen, to, tanztheater, wuppertal, caused, a, stir, in, the, dance, world, with, her, stark, depiction, played, out, on, an, earth, covered, stage, in, which, the, chosen, one, is, sacrificed, to, gratify, the, misogyny, of, the, surrounding, men, at, the, end, according, to, the, guardian, s, luke, jennings, the, cast, is, sweat, streaked, filthy, and, audibly, panting, part, of, this, dance, appears, in, the, film, pina, bausch, s, version, had, also, been, danced, by, two, ballet, companies, the, paris, opera, ballet, and, english, national, ballet, in, america, in, 1980, paul, taylor, used, stravinsky, s, four, hand, piano, version, of, the, score, as, the, background, for, a, scenario, based, on, child, murder, and, gangster, film, images, in, february, 1984, martha, graham, in, her, 90th, year, resumed, her, association, with, the, rite, by, choreographing, a, new, production, at, new, york, state, theater, the, new, york, times, critic, declared, the, performance, a, triumph, totally, elemental, as, primal, in, expression, of, basic, emotion, as, any, tribal, ceremony, as, hauntingly, staged, in, its, deliberate, bleakness, as, it, is, rich, in, implication, on, 30, september, 1987, the, joffrey, ballet, performed, in, los, angeles, the, rite, based, on, a, reconstruction, of, nijinsky, s, 1913, choreography, until, then, thought, lost, beyond, recall, the, performance, resulted, from, years, of, research, primarily, by, millicent, hodson, who, pieced, the, choreography, together, from, the, original, prompt, books, contemporary, sketches, and, photographs, and, the, recollections, of, marie, rambert, and, other, survivors, hodson, s, version, has, since, been, performed, by, the, kirov, ballet, at, the, mariinsky, theatre, in, 2003, and, later, that, year, at, covent, garden, in, its, 2012, 13, season, the, joffrey, ballet, gave, centennial, performances, at, numerous, venues, including, the, university, of, texas, on, 5, 6, march, 2013, the, university, of, massachusetts, on, 14, march, 2013, and, with, the, cleveland, orchestra, on, 17, 18, august, 2013, the, music, publishers, boosey, hawkes, have, estimated, that, since, its, premiere, the, ballet, has, been, the, subject, of, at, least, 150, productions, many, of, which, have, become, classics, and, have, been, performed, worldwide, among, the, more, radical, interpretations, is, glen, tetley, s, 1974, version, in, which, the, chosen, one, is, a, young, male, more, recently, there, have, been, solo, dance, versions, devised, by, molissa, fenley, and, javier, de, frutos, and, a, punk, rock, interpretation, from, michael, clark, the, 2004, film, rhythm, is, it, documents, a, project, by, conductor, simon, rattle, with, the, berlin, philharmonic, and, choreographer, royston, maldoom, to, stage, a, performance, of, the, ballet, with, a, cast, of, 250, children, recruited, from, berlin, s, public, schools, from, 25, countries, in, rites, 2008, by, the, australian, ballet, in, conjunction, with, bangarra, dance, theatre, aboriginal, perceptions, of, the, elements, of, earth, air, fire, and, water, are, featured, on, 18, february, 1914, the, rite, received, its, first, concert, performance, the, music, without, the, ballet, in, saint, petersburg, under, serge, koussevitzky, on, 5, april, that, year, stravinsky, experienced, for, himself, the, popular, success, of, le, sacre, as, a, concert, work, at, the, casino, de, paris, after, the, performance, again, under, monteux, the, composer, was, carried, in, triumph, from, the, hall, on, the, shoulders, of, his, admirers, the, rite, had, its, first, british, concert, performance, on, 7, june, 1921, at, the, queen, s, hall, in, london, under, eugene, goossens, its, american, premiere, occurred, on, 3, march, 1922, when, stokowski, included, it, in, a, philadelphia, orchestra, programme, goossens, was, also, responsible, for, introducing, the, rite, to, australia, on, 23, august, 1946, at, the, sydney, town, hall, as, guest, conductor, of, the, sydney, symphony, orchestra, stravinsky, first, conducted, the, work, in, 1926, in, a, concert, given, by, the, concertgebouw, orchestra, in, amsterdam, two, years, later, he, brought, it, to, the, salle, pleyel, in, paris, for, two, performances, under, his, baton, of, these, occasions, he, later, wrote, that, thanks, to, the, experience, i, had, gained, with, all, kinds, of, orchestras, i, had, reached, a, point, where, i, could, obtain, exactly, what, i, wanted, as, i, wanted, it, commentators, have, broadly, agreed, that, the, work, has, had, a, greater, impact, in, the, concert, hall, than, it, has, on, the, stage, many, of, stravinsky, s, revisions, to, the, music, were, made, with, the, concert, hall, rather, than, the, theatre, in, mind, the, work, has, become, a, staple, in, the, repertoires, of, all, the, leading, orchestras, and, has, been, cited, by, leonard, bernstein, as, the, most, important, piece, of, music, of, the, 20th, century, in, 1963, 50, years, after, the, premiere, monteux, then, aged, 88, agreed, to, conduct, a, commemorative, performance, at, london, s, royal, albert, hall, according, to, isaiah, berlin, a, close, friend, of, the, composer, stravinsky, informed, him, that, he, had, no, intention, of, hearing, his, music, being, murdered, by, that, frightful, butcher, instead, he, arranged, tickets, for, that, particular, evening, s, performance, of, mozart, s, opera, the, marriage, of, figaro, at, covent, garden, under, pressure, from, his, friends, stravinsky, was, persuaded, to, leave, the, opera, after, the, first, act, he, arrived, at, the, albert, hall, just, as, the, performance, of, the, rite, was, ending, composer, and, conductor, shared, a, warm, embrace, in, front, of, the, unaware, wildly, cheering, audience, monteux, s, biographer, john, canarina, provides, a, different, slant, on, this, occasion, recording, that, by, the, end, of, the, evening, stravinsky, had, asserted, that, monteux, almost, alone, among, conductors, never, cheapened, rite, or, looked, for, his, own, glory, in, it, and, he, continued, to, play, it, all, his, life, with, the, greatest, fidelity, commentators, have, often, described, the, rite, s, music, in, vivid, terms, paul, rosenfeld, in, 1920, wrote, of, it, pound, with, the, rhythm, of, engines, whirls, and, spirals, like, screws, and, fly, wheels, grinds, and, shrieks, like, laboring, metal, in, a, more, recent, analysis, the, new, york, times, critic, donal, henahan, refers, to, great, crunching, snarling, chords, from, the, brass, and, thundering, thumps, from, the, timpani, the, composer, julius, harrison, acknowledged, the, uniqueness, of, the, work, negatively, it, demonstrated, stravinsky, s, abhorrence, of, everything, for, which, music, has, stood, these, many, centuries, all, human, endeavour, and, progress, are, being, swept, aside, to, make, room, for, hideous, sounds, in, the, firebird, stravinsky, had, begun, to, experiment, with, bitonality, the, use, of, two, different, keys, simultaneously, he, took, this, technique, further, in, petrushka, but, reserved, its, full, effect, for, the, rite, where, as, the, analyst, e, w, white, explains, he, pushed, to, its, logical, conclusion, white, also, observes, the, music, s, complex, metrical, character, with, combinations, of, duple, and, triple, time, in, which, a, strong, irregular, beat, is, emphasised, by, powerful, percussion, the, music, critic, alex, ross, has, described, the, irregular, process, whereby, stravinsky, adapted, and, absorbed, traditional, russian, folk, material, into, the, score, he, proceeded, to, pulverize, them, into, motivic, bits, pile, them, up, in, layers, and, reassemble, them, in, cubistic, collages, and, montages, the, duration, of, the, work, is, about, 35, minutes, the, score, calls, for, a, large, orchestra, consisting, of, the, following, instruments, woodwinds, brass, percussion, strings, despite, the, large, orchestra, much, of, the, score, is, written, chamber, fashion, with, individual, instruments, and, small, groups, having, distinct, roles, the, opening, melody, is, played, by, a, solo, bassoon, in, a, very, high, register, which, renders, the, instrument, almost, unidentifiable, gradually, other, woodwind, instruments, are, sounded, and, are, eventually, joined, by, strings, the, sound, builds, up, before, stopping, suddenly, hill, says, just, as, it, is, bursting, ecstatically, into, bloom, there, is, then, a, reiteration, of, the, opening, bassoon, solo, now, played, a, semitone, lower, the, first, dance, augurs, of, spring, is, characterised, by, a, repetitive, stamping, chord, in, the, horns, and, strings, based, on, e, dominant, 7, superimposed, on, an, f, major, triad, i, e, f, a, and, c, white, suggests, that, this, bitonal, combination, which, stravinsky, considered, the, focal, point, of, the, entire, work, was, devised, on, the, piano, since, the, constituent, chords, are, comfortable, fits, for, the, hands, on, a, keyboard, the, rhythm, of, the, stamping, is, disturbed, by, stravinsky, s, constant, shifting, of, the, accent, on, and, off, the, beat, before, the, dance, ends, in, a, collapse, as, if, from, exhaustion, alex, ross, has, summed, up, the, pattern, italics, rhythmic, accents, as, follows, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, according, to, roger, nichols, at, first, sight, there, seems, no, pattern, in, the, distribution, of, accents, to, the, stamping, chords, taking, the, initial, quaver, of, bar, 1, as, a, natural, accent, we, have, for, the, first, outburst, the, following, groups, of, quavers, 9, 2, 6, 3, 4, 5, 3, however, these, apparently, random, numbers, make, sense, when, split, into, two, groups, 9, 6, 4, 3, 2, 3, 5, clearly, the, top, line, is, decreasing, the, bottom, line, increasing, and, by, respectively, decreasing, and, increasing, amounts, whether, stravinsky, worked, them, out, like, this, we, shall, probably, never, know, but, the, way, two, different, rhythmic, orders, interfere, with, each, other, to, produced, apparent, chaos, is, a, typically, stravinskyan, notion, the, ritual, of, abduction, which, follows, is, described, by, hill, as, the, most, terrifying, of, musical, hunts, it, concludes, in, a, series, of, flute, trills, that, usher, in, the, spring, rounds, in, which, a, slow, and, laborious, theme, gradually, rises, to, a, dissonant, fortissimo, a, ghastly, caricature, of, the, episode, s, main, tune, brass, and, percussion, predominate, as, the, ritual, of, the, rival, tribes, begins, a, tune, emerges, on, tenor, and, bass, tubas, leading, after, much, repetition, to, the, entry, of, the, sage, s, procession, the, music, then, comes, to, a, virtual, halt, bleached, free, of, colour, hill, as, the, sage, blesses, the, earth, the, dance, of, the, earth, then, begins, bringing, part, i, to, a, close, in, a, series, of, phrases, of, the, utmost, vigour, which, are, abruptly, terminated, in, what, hill, describes, as, a, blunt, brutal, amputation, part, ii, has, a, greater, cohesion, than, its, predecessor, hill, describes, the, music, as, following, an, arc, stretching, from, the, beginning, of, the, introduction, to, the, conclusion, of, the, final, dance, woodwind, and, muted, trumpets, are, prominent, throughout, the, introduction, which, ends, with, a, number, of, rising, cadences, on, strings, and, flutes, the, transition, into, the, mystic, circles, is, almost, imperceptible, the, main, theme, of, the, section, has, been, prefigured, in, the, introduction, a, loud, repeated, chord, which, berger, likens, to, a, call, to, order, announces, the, moment, for, choosing, the, sacrificial, victim, the, glorification, of, the, chosen, one, is, brief, and, violent, in, the, evocation, of, the, ancestors, that, follows, short, phrases, are, interspersed, with, drum, rolls, the, ritual, action, of, the, ancestors, begins, quietly, but, slowly, builds, to, a, series, of, climaxes, before, subsiding, suddenly, into, the, quiet, phrases, that, began, the, episode, the, final, transition, introduces, the, sacrificial, dance, this, is, written, as, a, more, disciplined, ritual, than, the, extravagant, dance, that, ended, part, i, though, it, contains, some, wild, moments, with, the, large, percussion, section, of, the, orchestra, given, full, voice, stravinsky, had, difficulties, with, this, section, especially, with, the, final, bars, that, conclude, the, work, the, abrupt, ending, displeased, several, critics, one, of, whom, wrote, that, the, music, suddenly, falls, over, on, its, side, stravinsky, himself, referred, to, the, final, chord, disparagingly, as, a, noise, but, in, his, various, attempts, to, amend, or, rewrite, the, section, was, unable, to, produce, a, more, acceptable, solution, the, music, historian, donald, jay, grout, has, written, the, sacre, is, undoubtedly, the, most, famous, composition, of, the, early, 20th, century, it, had, the, effect, of, an, explosion, that, so, scattered, the, elements, of, musical, language, that, they, could, never, again, be, put, together, as, before, the, academic, and, critic, jan, smaczny, echoing, bernstein, calls, it, one, of, the, 20th, century, s, most, influential, compositions, providing, endless, stimulation, for, performers, and, listeners, taruskin, writes, that, one, of, the, marks, of, the, rite, s, unique, status, is, the, number, of, books, that, have, been, devoted, to, it, certainly, a, greater, number, than, have, been, devoted, to, any, other, ballet, possibly, to, any, other, individual, musical, composition, according, to, kelly, the, 1913, premiere, might, be, considered, the, most, important, single, moment, in, the, history, of, 20th, century, music, and, its, repercussions, continue, to, reverberate, in, the, 21st, century, ross, has, described, the, rite, as, a, prophetic, work, presaging, the, second, avant, garde, era, in, classical, composition, music, of, the, body, rather, than, of, the, mind, in, which, elodies, would, follow, the, patterns, of, speech, rhythms, would, match, the, energy, of, dance, sonorities, would, have, the, hardness, of, life, as, it, is, really, lived, the, work, is, regarded, as, among, the, first, examples, of, modernism, in, music, among, 20th, century, composers, most, influenced, by, the, rite, is, stravinsky, s, near, contemporary, edgard, var, se, who, had, attended, the, 1913, premiere, var, se, according, to, ross, was, particularly, drawn, to, the, cruel, harmonies, and, stimulating, rhythms, of, the, rite, which, he, employed, to, full, effect, in, his, concert, work, am, riques, 1921, scored, for, a, massive, orchestra, with, added, sound, effects, including, a, lion, s, roar, and, a, wailing, siren, aaron, copland, to, whom, stravinsky, was, a, particular, inspiration, in, the, former, s, student, days, considered, the, rite, a, masterpiece, that, had, created, the, decade, of, the, displaced, accent, and, the, polytonal, chord, copland, adopted, stravinsky, s, technique, of, composing, in, small, sections, which, he, then, shuffled, and, rearranged, rather, than, working, through, from, beginning, to, end, ross, cites, the, music, of, copland, s, ballet, billy, the, kid, as, coming, directly, from, the, spring, rounds, section, of, the, rite, for, olivier, messiaen, the, rite, was, of, special, significance, he, constantly, analysed, and, expounded, on, the, work, which, gave, him, an, enduring, model, for, rhythmic, drive, and, assembly, of, material, stravinsky, was, sceptical, about, over, intellectual, analysis, of, the, work, the, man, has, found, reasons, for, every, note, and, that, the, clarinet, line, in, page, 3, is, the, inverted, counterpoint, of, the, horn, in, page, 19, i, never, thought, about, that, he, allegedly, replied, to, michel, legrand, when, asked, about, pierre, boulez, s, take, on, the, matter, after, the, premiere, the, writer, l, on, vallas, opined, that, stravinsky, had, written, music, 30, years, ahead, of, its, time, suitable, to, be, heard, in, 1940, coincidentally, it, was, in, that, year, that, walt, disney, released, fantasia, an, animated, feature, film, using, music, from, the, rite, and, other, classical, compositions, conducted, by, stokowski, the, rite, segment, of, the, film, depicted, the, earth, s, prehistory, with, the, creation, of, life, leading, to, the, extinction, of, the, dinosaurs, as, the, finale, among, those, impressed, by, the, film, was, gunther, schuller, later, a, composer, conductor, and, jazz, scholar, the, rite, of, spring, sequence, he, says, overwhelmed, him, and, determined, his, future, career, in, music, i, hope, appreciated, that, hundreds, perhaps, thousands, of, musicians, were, turned, onto, the, rite, of, spring, through, fantasia, musicians, who, might, otherwise, never, have, heard, the, work, or, at, least, not, until, many, years, later, in, later, life, stravinsky, claimed, distaste, for, the, adaptation, though, as, ross, remarks, he, said, nothing, critical, at, the, time, according, to, ross, the, composer, paul, hindemith, observed, that, igor, appears, to, love, it, before, the, first, gramophone, disc, recordings, of, the, rite, were, issued, in, 1929, stravinsky, had, helped, to, produce, a, pianola, version, of, the, work, for, the, london, branch, of, the, aeolian, company, he, also, created, a, much, more, comprehensive, arrangement, for, the, pleyela, manufactured, by, the, french, piano, company, pleyel, with, whom, he, signed, two, contracts, in, april, and, may, 1921, under, which, many, of, his, early, works, were, reproduced, on, this, medium, the, pleyela, version, of, the, rite, of, spring, was, issued, in, 1921, the, british, pianolist, rex, lawson, first, recorded, the, work, in, this, form, in, 1990, in, 1929, stravinsky, and, monteux, vied, with, each, other, to, conduct, the, first, orchestral, gramophone, recording, of, the, rite, while, stravinsky, led, l, orchestre, des, concerts, straram, in, a, recording, for, the, columbia, label, at, the, same, time, monteux, was, recording, it, for, the, hmv, label, stokowski, s, version, followed, in, 1930, stravinsky, made, two, more, recordings, in, 1940, and, 1960, according, to, the, critic, edward, greenfield, stravinsky, was, not, technically, a, great, conductor, but, greenfield, says, in, the, 1960, recording, with, the, columbia, symphony, orchestra, the, composer, inspired, a, performance, with, extraordinary, thrust, and, resilience, in, conversations, with, robert, craft, stravinsky, reviewed, several, recordings, of, the, rite, made, in, the, 1960s, he, thought, herbert, von, karajan, s, 1963, recording, with, the, berlin, philharmonic, was, good, but, the, performance, is, too, polished, a, pet, savage, rather, than, a, real, one, stravinsky, thought, that, pierre, boulez, with, the, orchestre, national, de, france, 1963, was, less, good, than, i, had, hoped, very, bad, tempi, and, some, tasteless, alterations, he, praised, a, 1962, recording, by, the, moscow, state, symphony, orchestra, for, making, the, music, sound, russian, which, is, just, right, but, stravinsky, s, concluding, judgement, was, that, none, of, these, three, performances, was, worth, preserving, as, of, 2013, there, were, well, over, 100, different, recordings, of, the, rite, commercially, available, and, many, more, held, in, library, sound, archives, it, has, become, one, of, the, most, recorded, of, all, 20th, century, musical, works, the, first, published, score, was, the, four, hand, piano, arrangement, edition, russe, de, musique, rv196, dated, 1913, publication, of, the, full, orchestral, score, was, prevented, by, the, outbreak, of, war, in, august, 1914, after, the, revival, of, the, work, in, 1920, stravinsky, who, had, not, heard, the, music, for, seven, years, made, numerous, revisions, to, the, score, which, was, finally, published, in, 1921, edition, russe, de, musique, rv, 197, 197b, large, and, pocket, scores, in, 1922, ansermet, who, was, preparing, to, perform, the, work, in, berlin, sent, to, stravinsky, a, list, of, errors, he, had, found, in, the, published, score, in, 1926, as, part, of, his, preparation, for, that, year, s, performance, with, the, concertgebouw, orchestra, stravinsky, rewrote, the, evocation, of, the, ancestors, section, and, made, substantial, changes, to, the, sacrificial, dance, the, extent, of, these, revisions, together, with, ansermet, s, recommendations, convinced, stravinsky, that, a, new, edition, was, necessary, and, this, appeared, in, large, and, pocket, form, in, 1929, it, did, not, however, incorporate, all, of, ansermet, s, amendments, and, confusingly, bore, the, date, and, rv, code, of, the, 1921, edition, making, the, new, edition, hard, to, identify, stravinsky, continued, to, revise, the, work, and, in, 1943, rewrote, the, sacrificial, dance, in, 1948, boosey, hawkes, issued, a, corrected, version, of, the, 1929, score, b, h, 16333, although, stravinsky, s, substantial, 1943, amendment, of, the, sacrificial, dance, was, not, incorporated, into, the, new, version, and, remained, unperformed, to, the, composer, s, disappointment, he, considered, it, much, easier, to, play, and, superior, in, balance, and, sonority, to, the, earlier, versions, a, less, musical, motive, for, the, revisions, and, corrected, editions, was, copyright, law, the, composer, had, left, galaxy, music, corporation, agents, for, editions, russe, de, la, musique, the, original, publisher, for, associated, music, publishers, at, the, time, and, orchestras, would, be, reluctant, to, pay, a, second, rental, charge, from, two, publishers, to, match, the, full, work, and, the, revised, sacrificial, dance, moreover, the, revised, dance, could, only, be, published, in, america, the, 1948, score, provided, copyright, protection, to, the, work, in, america, where, it, had, lapsed, but, boosey, who, acquired, the, editions, russe, catalogue, did, not, have, the, rights, to, the, revised, finale, the, 1929, score, as, revised, in, 1948, forms, the, basis, of, most, modern, performances, of, the, rite, boosey, hawkes, reissued, their, 1948, edition, in, 1965, and, produced, a, newly, engraved, edition, b, h, 19441, in, 1967, the, firm, also, issued, an,
