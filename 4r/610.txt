introduced, in, 2019, for, the, 2020, oscars, dvd, screeners, and, academy, in, person, screenings, were, still, provided, for, films, to, be, included, on, the, platform, the, north, american,

apple, tv, and, roku, players, the, watermarking, process, involved, several, video, security, firms, creating, a, forensic, watermark, and, restricting, the, ability, to, take, screenshots, or, screen, recordings, in, 2021, for, the, 2022, oscars, the, academy, banned, all, physical, screeners, and, in, person, screenings, restricting, official, membership, viewing, to, the, academy, screening, room, films, eligible, in, the, documentary, and, international, categories, were, made, available, in, different, sections, of, the, platform, distributors, can, also, pay, an, extra, fee, to, add, video, featurettes, to, promote, their, films, on, the, platform, the, in, person, screenings, were, said, to, be, cancelled, because, of, the, covid, 19, pandemic, eligible, films, do, not, have, to, be, added, to, the, platform, but, the, academy, advertises, them, to, voting, members, when, they, are, the, major, awards, are, presented, at, a, live, televised, ceremony, commonly, in, late, february, or, early, march, following, the, relevant, calendar, year, and, six, weeks, after, the, announcement, of, the, nominees, it, is, the, culmination, of, the, film, awards, season, which, usually, begins, during, november, or, december, of, the, previous, year, this, is, an, elaborate, extravaganza, with, the, invited, guests, walking, up, the, red, carpet, in, the, creations, of, the, most, prominent, fashion, designers, of, the, day, black, tie, dress, is, the, most, common, outfit, for, men, fashion, may, dictate, not, wearing, a, bow, tie, and, musical, performers, are, sometimes, not, required, to, adhere, to, this, the, artists, who, recorded, the, nominees, for, best, original, song, quite, often, perform, those, songs, live, at, the, awards, ceremony, and, the, fact, that, they, are, performing, is, often, used, to, promote, the, television, broadcast, the, academy, awards, is, the, world, s, longest, running, awards, show, televised, live, from, the, united, states, to, all, time, zones, in, north, america, and, worldwide, and, gathers, billions, of, viewers, elsewhere, throughout, the, world, the, oscars, were, first, televised, in, 1953, by, nbc, which, continued, to, broadcast, the, event, until, 1960, when, abc, took, over, televising, the, festivities, including, the, first, color, broadcast, of, the, event, in, 1966, to, 1970, nbc, regained, the, rights, for, five, years, 1971, 75, then, abc, resumed, broadcast, duties, in, 1976, and, its, current, contract, with, the, academy, runs, through, 2028, the, academy, has, produced, condensed, versions, of, the, ceremony, for, broadcast, in, international, markets, especially, those, outside, of, the, americas, in, more, desirable, local, timeslots, the, ceremony, was, broadcast, live, internationally, for, the, first, time, via, satellite, since, 1970, but, only, two, south, american, countries, chile, and, brazil, purchased, the, rights, to, air, the, broadcast, by, that, time, the, television, rights, to, the, academy, awards, had, been, sold, in, 50, countries, in, 1980, the, rights, were, sold, to, 60, countries, and, by, 1984, the, television, rights, to, the, academy, awards, were, licensed, in, 76, countries, in, 2004, the, ceremonies, were, moved, up, from, late, march, early, april, to, late, february, to, help, disrupt, and, shorten, the, intense, lobbying, and, ad, campaigns, associated, with, oscar, season, in, the, film, industry, another, reason, was, because, of, the, growing, television, ratings, success, coinciding, with, the, ncaa, division, i, men, s, basketball, tournament, which, would, cut, into, the, academy, awards, audience, in, 1976, and, 1977, abc, s, regained, oscars, were, moved, from, tuesday, to, monday, and, went, directly, opposite, the, national, championship, game, on, nbc, the, earlier, date, is, also, to, the, advantage, of, abc, as, it, now, usually, occurs, during, the, highly, profitable, and, important, february, sweeps, period, some, years, the, ceremony, is, moved, into, the, first, sunday, of, march, to, avoid, a, clash, with, the, winter, olympic, games, another, reason, for, the, move, to, late, february, and, early, march, is, to, avoid, the, awards, ceremony, occurring, so, close, to, the, religious, holidays, of, passover, and, easter, which, for, decades, had, been, a, grievance, from, members, and, the, general, public, advertising, is, somewhat, restricted, as, traditionally, no, movie, studios, or, competitors, of, official, academy, award, sponsors, may, advertise, during, the, telecast, as, of, 2020, the, production, of, the, academy, awards, telecast, held, the, distinction, of, winning, one, the, highest, number, of, emmys, in, history, with, 54, wins, and, 280, nominations, overall, after, many, years, of, being, held, on, mondays, at, 6, 00, p, m, pacific, 9, 00, pm, eastern, since, the, 1999, ceremonies, it, was, moved, to, sundays, at, 5, 30, pm, pt, 8, 30, pm, et, the, reasons, given, for, the, move, were, that, more, viewers, would, tune, in, on, sundays, that, los, angeles, rush, hour, traffic, jams, could, be, avoided, and, an, earlier, start, time, would, allow, viewers, on, the, east, coast, to, go, to, bed, earlier, for, many, years, the, film, industry, opposed, a, sunday, broadcast, because, it, would, cut, into, the, weekend, box, office, in, 2010, the, academy, contemplated, moving, the, ceremony, even, further, back, into, january, citing, television, viewers, fatigue, with, the, film, industry, s, long, awards, season, however, such, an, accelerated, schedule, would, dramatically, decrease, the, voting, period, for, its, members, to, the, point, where, some, voters, would, only, have, time, to, view, the, contending, films, streamed, on, their, computers, as, opposed, to, traditionally, receiving, the, films, and, ballots, in, the, mail, furthermore, a, january, ceremony, on, sunday, would, clash, with, national, football, league, nfl, playoff, games, in, 2018, the, academy, announced, that, the, ceremony, would, be, moved, from, late, february, to, mid, february, beginning, with, the, 92nd, academy, awards, in, 2020, in, 2024, the, ceremony, was, moved, to, an, even, earlier, start, time, of, 4, 00, pm, pt, 7, 00, p, m, et, the, apparent, impetus, being, the, ability, for, abc, to, air, a, half, hour, of, primetime, programming, as, a, lead, out, program, at, 7, 30, p, m, pt, 10, 30, p, m, et, originally, scheduled, for, april, 8, 1968, the, 40th, academy, awards, ceremony, was, postponed, for, two, days, because, of, the, assassination, of, dr, martin, luther, king, jr, on, march, 30, 1981, the, 53rd, academy, awards, was, postponed, for, one, day, after, the, attempted, assassination, of, president, ronald, reagan, and, others, in, washington, d, c, in, 1993, an, in, memoriam, segment, was, introduced, honoring, those, who, had, made, a, significant, contribution, to, cinema, who, had, died, in, the, preceding, 12, months, a, selection, compiled, by, a, small, committee, of, academy, members, this, segment, has, drawn, criticism, over, the, years, for, the, omission, of, some, names, criticism, was, also, levied, for, many, years, regarding, another, aspect, with, the, segment, having, a, popularity, contest, feel, as, the, audience, varied, their, applause, to, those, who, had, died, by, the, subject, s, cultural, impact, the, applause, has, since, been, muted, during, the, telecast, and, the, audience, is, discouraged, from, clapping, during, the, segment, and, giving, silent, reflection, instead, this, segment, was, later, followed, by, a, commercial, break, in, terms, of, broadcast, length, the, ceremony, generally, averages, three, and, a, half, hours, the, first, oscars, in, 1929, lasted, 15, minutes, at, the, other, end, of, the, spectrum, the, 2002, ceremony, lasted, four, hours, and, twenty, three, minutes, in, 2010, the, organizers, of, the, academy, awards, announced, winners, acceptance, speeches, must, not, run, past, 45, seconds, this, according, to, organizer, bill, mechanic, was, to, ensure, the, elimination, of, what, he, termed, the, single, most, hated, thing, on, the, show, overly, long, and, embarrassing, displays, of, emotion, in, 2016, in, a, further, effort, to, streamline, speeches, winners, dedications, were, displayed, on, an, on, screen, ticker, during, the, 2018, ceremony, host, jimmy, kimmel, acknowledged, how, long, the, ceremony, had, become, by, announcing, that, he, would, give, a, brand, new, jet, ski, to, whoever, gave, the, shortest, speech, of, the, night, a, reward, won, by, mark, bridges, when, accepting, his, best, costume, design, award, for, phantom, thread, the, wall, street, journal, analyzed, the, average, minutes, spent, across, the, 2014, 2018, telecasts, as, follows, 14, on, song, performances, 25, on, the, hosts, speeches, 38, on, prerecorded, clips, and, 78, on, the, awards, themselves, broken, into, 24, on, the, introduction, and, announcement, 24, on, winners, walking, to, the, stage, and, 30, on, their, acceptance, speeches, although, still, dominant, in, ratings, the, viewership, of, the, academy, awards, has, steadily, dropped, the, 88th, academy, awards, were, the, lowest, rated, in, the, past, eight, years, although, with, increases, in, male, and, 18, 49, viewership, while, the, show, itself, also, faced, mixed, reception, following, the, show, variety, reported, that, abc, was, in, negotiating, an, extension, to, its, contract, to, broadcast, the, oscars, seeking, to, have, more, creative, control, over, the, broadcast, itself, currently, and, nominally, ampas, is, responsible, for, most, aspects, of, the, telecast, including, the, choice, of, production, staff, and, hosting, although, abc, is, allowed, to, have, some, input, on, their, decisions, in, august, 2016, ampas, extended, its, contract, with, abc, to, 2028, the, contract, neither, contains, any, notable, changes, nor, gives, abc, any, further, creative, control, over, the, telecast, historically, the, telecast, s, viewership, is, higher, when, box,

honoring, films, that, have, not, performed, well, at, the, box, office, tend, to, show, weaker, ratings, despite, how, much, critical, acclaim, those, films, have, received, the, 78th, academy, awards, which, awarded, a, low, budget, independent, film, crash, with, a, pre, oscar, gross, of, us, 53, 4, million, generated, an, audience, of, 38, 64, million, with, a, household, rating, of, 22,

simultaneously, in, hollywood, and, new, york, first, at, the, nbc, international, theatre, 1953, and, then, at, the, nbc, century, theatre, after, which, the, ceremony, took, place, solely, in, los, angeles, in, 1961, the, oscars, moved, to, the, santa, monica, civic, auditorium, in, santa, monica, california, in, 1969, the, academy, moved, the, ceremonies, back, to, downtown, los, angeles, to, the, dorothy, chandler, pavilion, at, the, los, angeles, county, music, center, in, the, late, 1990s, and, early, 2000s, the, ceremony, returned, to, the, shrine, auditorium, in, 2002, hollywood, s,

categories, drama, and, comedy, at, times, the, best, original, score, award, has, also, been, split, into, separate, categories, drama, and, comedy, musical, from, the, 1930s, to, the, 1960s, the, art, direction, now, production, design, cinematography, and, costume, design, awards, were, split, into, two, categories, black, and, white, films, and, color, films, prior, to, 2012, the, production, design, award, was, called, art, direction, while, the, makeup, and, hairstyling, award, was, called, makeup, in, august, 2018, the, academy, announced, that, several, categories, would, not, be, televised, live, but, recorded, during, commercial, breaks, and, aired, later, in, the, ceremony, following, dissent, from, academy, members, they, announced, that, they, would, air, all, 24, categories, live, this, followed, several, proposals, among, them, the, introduction, of, a, popular, film, category, that, the, academy, had, announced, but, did, not, implement, the, board, of, governors, meets, each, year, and, considers, new, award, categories, to, date, the, following, categories, have, been, proposed, the, special, academy, awards, are, voted, on, by, special, committees, rather, than, by, the, academy, membership, as, a, whole, they, are, not, always, presented, on, an, annual, basis, due, to, the, positive, exposure, and, prestige, of, the, academy, awards, many, studios, spend, around, 25, million, dollars, and, hire, publicists, specifically, to, promote, their, films, during, what, is, typically, called, the, oscar, season, this, has, generated, accusations, of, the, academy, awards, being, influenced, more, by, marketing, and, lobbying, than, by, quality, william, friedkin, an, academy, award, winning, film, director, and, former, producer, of, the, ceremony, expressed, this, sentiment, at, a, conference, in, new, york, in, 2009, describing, it, as, the, greatest, promotion, scheme, that, any, industry, ever, devised, for, itself, tim, dirks, editor, of, amc, s, filmsite, has, written, of, the, academy, awards, unfortunately, the, critical, worth, artistic, vision, cultural, influence, and, innovative, qualities, of, many, films, are, not, given, the, same, voting, weight, especially, since, the, 1980s, moneymaking, formula, made, blockbusters, with, glossy, production, values, have, often, been, crowd, pleasing, titans, and, best, picture, winners, but, they, haven, t, necessarily, been, great, films, with, depth, or, critical, acclaim, by, any, measure, a, recent, technique, that, has, been, claimed, to, be, used, during, the, oscar, season, is, the, whisper, campaign, these, campaigns, are, intended, to, spread, negative, perceptions, of, other, movies, nominated, and, are, believed, to, be, perpetrated, by, those, who, were, involved, in, creating, the, movie, examples, of, whisper, campaigns, include, the, allegations, against, zero, dark, thirty, suggesting, that, it, justifies, torture, and, the, claim, that, lincoln, distorts, history, typical, criticism, of, the, academy, awards, for, best, picture, is, that, among, the, winners, and, nominees, there, is, an, over, representation, of, romantic, historical, epics, biographical, dramas, romantic, dramedies, and, family, melodramas, most, of, which, are, released, in, the, u, s, in, the, last, three, months, of, the, calendar, year, the, oscars, have, been, infamously, known, for, selecting, specific, genres, of, movies, to, be, awarded, the, term, oscar, bait, was, coined, to, describe, such, movies, this, has, led, at, times, to, more, specific, criticisms, that, the, academy, is, disconnected, from, the, audience, e, g, by, favoring, oscar, bait, over, audience, favorites, or, favoring, historical, melodramas, over, critically, acclaimed, movies, that, depict, current, life, issues, despite, the, success, of, the, dark, knight, the, film, did, not, receive, a, best, picture, nomination, at, the, 81st, academy, awards, this, decision, received, substantial, criticism, and, was, described, as, a, snub, by, many, publications, the, backlash, to, the, decision, was, such, that, for, the, 82nd, academy, awards, awards, in, 2010, the, academy, increased, the, limit, for, best, picture, nominees, from, five, to, ten, a, change, known, as, the, dark, knight, rule, the, academy, awards, have, long, received, criticism, over, its, lack, of, diversity, among, the, nominees, this, criticism, is, based, on, the, statistics, from, every, academy, awards, since, 1929, which, show, that, only, 6, 4, of, academy, award, nominees, have, been, non, white, and, since, 1991, 11, 2, of, nominees, have, been, non, white, with, the, rate, of, winners, being, even, more, polarizing, for, a, variety, of, reasons, including, marketability, and, historical, bans, on, interracial, couples, a, number, of, high, profile, oscars, have, been, given, to, yellowface, portrayals, as, well, as, performances, of, asian, characters, rewritten, for, white, characters, it, took, until, 2023, for, an, asian, woman, to, win, an, academy, award, for, best, actress, when, michelle, yeoh, received, the, award, for, her, performance, in, everything, everywhere, all, at, once, the, 88th, awards, ceremony, became, the, target, of, a, boycott, popularized, on, social, media, with, the, hashtag, oscarssowhite, based, on, activists, perception, that, its, all, white, acting, nominee, list, reflected, bias, in, response, the, academy, initiated, historic, changes, in, membership, by, 2020, some, media, critics, claim, the, academy, s, efforts, to, address, its, purported, racial, gender, and, national, biases, are, merely, distractions, by, contrast, the, golden, globe, awards, already, have, multiple, winners, of, asian, descent, in, leading, actress, categories, some, question, whether, the, academy, s, definition, of, merit, is, just, or, empowering, for, non, americans, the, academy, s, representation, and, inclusion, standards, have, been, criticized, for, excluding, jews, as, a, distinct, underrepresented, class, the, academy, has, no, rules, for, how, to, categorize, whether, a, performance, is, leading, or, supporting, and, it, is, up, to, the, discretion, of, the, studios, whether, a, given, performance, is, submitted, for, either, best, actor, actress, or, best, supporting, actor, actress, this, has, led, to, situations, where, a, film, has, two, or, more, co, leads, and, one, of, these, is, submitted, in, a, supporting, category, to, avoid, the, two, leads, competing, against, each, other, and, to, increase, the, film, s, chances, of, winning, this, practice, has, been, derisively, called, category, fraud, for, example, rooney, mara, was, nominated, for, best, supporting, actress, for, carol, 2015, despite, her, having, a, comparable, amount, of, screentime, to, cate, blanchett, who, was, nominated, for, best, actress, another, example, is, once, upon, a, time, in, hollywood, 2019, where, brad, pitt, was, nominated, for, and, won, best, supporting, actor, even, though, he, played, an, equally, important, role, to, best, actor, nominee, leonardo, dicaprio, in, both, these, cases, critics, argued, that, the, weinstein, company, the, studio, behind, the, former, film, had, placed, someone, who, was, actually, a, leading, actor, or, actress, into, the, supporting, categories, to, avoid, them, competing, against, their, co, lead, acting, prizes, in, certain, years, have, been, criticized, for, not, recognizing, superior, performances, so, much, as, being, awarded, for, personal, popularity, to, make, up, for, a, snub, for, a, work, that, proved, in, time, to, be, more, popular, or, renowned, than, the, one, awarded, or, presented, as, a, career, honor, to, recognize, a, distinguished, nominee, s, entire, body, of, work, following, the, 91st, academy, awards, in, february, 2019, in, which, the, netflix, broadcast, film, roma, had, been, nominated, for, ten, awards, including, the, best, picture, category, steven, spielberg, and, other, members, of, the, academy, discussed, changing, the, requirements, through, the, board, of, governors, for, films, as, to, exclude, those, from, netflix, and, other, media, streaming, services, spielberg, had, been, concerned, that, netflix, as, a, movie, production, and, distribution, studio, could, spend, much, more, than, for, typical, oscar, winning, films, and, have, much, wider, and, earlier, distribution, than, for, other, best, picture, nominated, films, while, still, being, able, to, meet, the, minimal, theatrical, run, status, to, qualify, for, an, oscar, the, united, states, department, of, justice, having, heard, of, this, potential, rule, change, wrote, a, letter, to, the, academy, in, march, 2019, cautioning, them, that, placing, additional, restrictions, on, films, that, originate, from, streaming, media, services, without, proper, justification, could, raise, anti, trust, concerns, against, the, academy, following, its, april, 2019, board, meeting, the, academy, board, of, governors, agreed, to, retain, the, current, rules, that, allow, for, streaming, media, films, to, be, eligible, for, oscars, as, long, as, they, enjoy, limited, theatrical, runs, during, the, 94th, academy, awards, on, march, 27, 2022, chris, rock, joked, about, jada, pinkett, smith, s, shaved, head, with, a, g, i, jane, reference, will, smith, walked, onstage, and, slapped, rock, across, the, face, then, returned, to, his, seat, and, told, rock, twice, to, keep, my, wife, s, name, out, your, fucking, mouth, while, later, accepting, the, best, actor, award, for, king, richard, smith, apologized, to, the, academy, and, the, other, nominees, but, not, to, rock,
