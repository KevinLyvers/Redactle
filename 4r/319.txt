a, harpsichord, italian, clavicembalo, french, clavecin, german, cembalo, spanish, clavec, n, portuguese, cravo, russian, tr, klaves, n, or, klavesin, dutch, klavecimbel, polish, klawesyn, is, a, musical, instrument, played, by, means, of, a, keyboard, this, activates, a, row, of, levers, that, turn, a, trigger, mechanism, that, plucks, one, or, more, strings, with, a, small, plectrum, made, from, quill, or, plastic, the, strings, are, under, tension, on, a, soundboard, which, is, mounted, in, a, wooden, case, the, soundboard, amplifies, the, vibrations, from, the, strings, so, that, the, listeners, can, hear, it, like, a, pipe, organ, a, harpsichord, may, have, more, than, one, keyboard, manual, and, even, a, pedal, board, harpsichords, may, also, have, stop, buttons, which, add, or, remove, additional, octaves, some, harpsichords, may, have, a, buff, stop, which, brings, a, strip, of, buff, leather, or, other, material, in, contact, with, the, strings, muting, their, sound, to, simulate, the, sound, of, a, plucked, lute, the, term, denotes, the, whole, family, of, similar, plucked, keyboard, instruments, including, the, smaller, virginals, muselar, and, spinet, the, harpsichord, was, widely, used, in, renaissance, and, baroque, music, both, as, an, accompaniment, instrument, and, as, a, soloing, instrument, during, the, baroque, era, the, harpsichord, was, a, standard, part, of, the, continuo, group, the, basso, continuo, part, acted, as, the, foundation, for, many, musical, pieces, in, this, era, during, the, late, 18th, century, with, the, development, of, the, fortepiano, and, then, the, increasing, use, of, the, piano, in, the, 19th, century, the, harpsichord, gradually, disappeared, from, the, musical, scene, except, in, opera, where, it, continued, to, be, used, to, accompany, recitative, in, the, 20th, century, it, made, a, resurgence, being, used, in, historically, informed, performances, of, older, music, in, new, compositions, and, in, rare, cases, in, certain, styles, of, popular, music, e, g, baroque, pop, the, harpsichord, was, most, likely, invented, in, the, late, middle, ages, by, the, 16th, century, harpsichord, makers, in, italy, were, making, lightweight, instruments, with, low, tension, brass, stringing, a, different, approach, was, taken, in, the, southern, netherlands, starting, in, the, late, 16th, century, notably, by, the, ruckers, family, their, harpsichords, used, a, heavier, construction, and, produced, a, more, powerful, and, distinctive, tone, with, higher, tension, steel, treble, stringing, these, included, the, first, harpsichords, with, two, keyboards, used, for, transposition, the, flemish, instruments, served, as, the, model, for, 18th, century, harpsichord, construction, in, other, nations, in, france, the, double, keyboards, were, adapted, to, control, different, choirs, of, strings, making, a, more, musically, flexible, instrument, so, called, expressive, doubles, instruments, from, the, peak, of, the, french, tradition, by, makers, such, as, the, blanchet, family, and, pascal, taskin, are, among, the, most, widely, admired, of, all, harpsichords, and, are, frequently, used, as, models, for, the, construction, of, modern, instruments, in, england, the, kirkman, and, shudi, firms, produced, sophisticated, harpsichords, of, great, power, and, sonority, german, builders, such, as, hieronymus, albrecht, hass, extended, the, sound, repertoire, of, the, instrument, by, adding, sixteen, foot, and, two, foot, choirs, these, instruments, have, recently, served, as, models, for, modern, builders, around, the, year, 1700, the, first, fortepiano, was, built, by, bartolomeo, cristofori, the, early, fortepiano, uses, percussion, the, strings, being, struck, with, leathered, paper, hammers, instead, of, being, plucked, the, fortepiano, is, capable, of, changes, in, dynamic, volume, giving, it, its, name, this, is, unlike, the, harpsichord, by, the, late, 18th, century, the, harpsichord, was, supplanted, by, the, piano, and, almost, disappeared, from, view, for, most, of, the, 19th, century, an, exception, was, its, continued, use, in, opera, for, accompanying, recitative, but, the, piano, sometimes, displaced, it, even, there, twentieth, century, efforts, to, revive, the, harpsichord, began, with, instruments, that, used, piano, technology, with, heavy, strings, and, metal, frames, starting, in, the, middle, of, the, 20th, century, ideas, about, harpsichord, making, underwent, a, major, change, when, builders, such, as, frank, hubbard, william, dowd, and, martin, skowroneck, sought, to, re, establish, the, building, traditions, of, the, baroque, period, harpsichords, of, this, type, of, historically, informed, building, practice, dominate, the, current, scene, harpsichords, vary, in, size, and, shape, but, all, have, the, same, basic, mechanism, the, player, depresses, a, key, that, rocks, over, a, pivot, in, the, middle, of, its, length, the, other, end, of, the, key, lifts, a, jack, a, long, strip, of, wood, that, holds, a, small, plectrum, a, wedge, shaped, piece, of, quill, often, made, of, plastic, in, the, 21st, century, which, plucks, the, string, when, the, player, releases, the, key, the, far, end, returns, to, its, rest, position, and, the, jack, falls, back, the, plectrum, mounted, on, a, tongue, mechanism, that, can, swivel, backwards, away, from, the, string, passes, the, string, without, plucking, it, again, as, the, key, reaches, its, rest, position, a, felt, damper, atop, the, jack, stops, the, string, s, vibrations, these, basic, principles, are, explained, in, detail, below, each, string, is, wound, around, a, tuning, pin, also, known, as, a, wrest, pin, at, the, end, nearest, the, player, when, rotated, with, a, wrench, or, tuning, hammer, the, tuning, pin, adjusts, the, tension, so, that, the, string, sounds, the, correct, pitch, tuning, pins, are, held, tightly, in, holes, drilled, in, the, pinblock, or, wrestplank, an, oblong, hardwood, plank, proceeding, from, the, tuning, pin, a, string, next, passes, over, the, nut, a, sharp, edge, that, is, made, of, hardwood, and, is, normally, attached, to, the, wrestplank, the, section, of, the, string, beyond, the, nut, forms, its, vibrating, length, which, is, plucked, and, creates, sound, at, the, other, end, of, its, vibrating, length, the, string, passes, over, the, bridge, another, sharp, edge, made, of, hardwood, as, with, the, nut, the, horizontal, position, of, the, string, along, the, bridge, is, determined, by, a, vertical, metal, pin, inserted, into, the, bridge, against, which, the, string, rests, the, bridge, itself, rests, on, a, soundboard, a, thin, panel, of, wood, usually, made, of, spruce, fir, or, in, some, italian, harpsichords, cypress, the, soundboard, efficiently, transmits, the, vibrations, of, the, strings, into, vibrations, in, the, air, without, a, soundboard, the, strings, would, produce, only, a, very, feeble, sound, a, string, is, attached, at, its, far, end, by, a, loop, to, a, hitchpin, that, secures, it, to, the, case, while, many, harpsichords, have, one, string, per, note, more, elaborate, harpsichords, can, have, two, or, more, strings, for, each, note, when, there, are, multiple, strings, for, each, note, these, additional, strings, are, called, choirs, of, strings, this, provides, two, advantages, the, ability, to, vary, volume, and, ability, to, vary, tonal, quality, volume, is, increased, when, the, mechanism, of, the, instrument, is, set, up, by, the, player, see, below, so, that, the, press, of, a, single, key, plucks, more, than, one, string, tonal, quality, can, be, varied, in, two, ways, first, different, choirs, of, strings, can, be, designed, to, have, distinct, tonal, qualities, usually, by, having, one, set, of, strings, plucked, closer, to, the, nut, which, emphasizes, the, higher, harmonics, and, produces, a, nasal, sound, quality, the, mechanism, of, the, instrument, called, stops, following, the, use, of, the, term, in, pipe, organs, permits, the, player, to, select, one, choir, or, the, other, second, having, one, key, pluck, two, strings, at, once, changes, not, just, volume, but, also, tonal, quality, for, instance, when, two, strings, tuned, to, the, same, pitch, are, plucked, simultaneously, the, note, is, not, just, louder, but, also, richer, and, more, complex, a, particularly, vivid, effect, is, obtained, when, the, strings, plucked, simultaneously, are, an, octave, apart, this, is, normally, heard, by, the, ear, not, as, two, pitches, but, as, one, the, sound, of, the, higher, string, is, blended, with, that, of, the, lower, one, and, the, ear, hears, the, lower, pitch, enriched, in, tonal, quality, by, the, additional, strength, in, the, upper, harmonics, of, the, note, sounded, by, the, higher, string, when, describing, a, harpsichord, it, is, customary, to, specify, its, choirs, of, strings, often, called, its, disposition, to, describe, the, pitch, of, the, choirs, of, strings, pipe, organ, terminology, is, used, strings, at, eight, foot, pitch, 8, sound, at, the, normal, expected, pitch, strings, at, four, foot, pitch, 4, sound, an, octave, higher, harpsichords, occasionally, include, a, sixteen, foot, 16, choir, one, octave, lower, than, eight, foot, or, a, two, foot, 2, choir, two, octaves, higher, quite, rare, when, there, are, multiple, choirs, of, strings, the, player, is, often, able, to, control, which, choirs, sound, this, is, usually, done, by, having, a, set, of, jacks, for, each, choir, and, a, mechanism, for, turning, off, each, set, often, by, moving, the, upper, register, through, which, the, jacks, slide, sideways, a, short, distance, so, that, their, plectra, miss, the, strings, in, simpler, instruments, this, is, done, by, manually, moving, the, registers, but, as, the, harpsichord, evolved, builders, invented, levers, knee, levers, and, pedal, mechanisms, to, make, it, easier, to, change, registration, harpsichords, with, more, than, one, keyboard, this, usually, means, two, keyboards, stacked, one, on, top, of, the, other, in, a, step, wise, fashion, as, with, pipe, organs, provide, flexibility, in, selecting, which, strings, play, since, each, manual, can, be, set, to, control, the, plucking, of, a, different, set, of, strings, this, means, that, a, player, can, have, for, instance, an, 8, manual, and, a, 4, manual, ready, for, use, enabling, him, to, switch, between, them, to, obtain, higher, or, lower, pitches, or, different, tone, in, addition, such, harpsichords, often, have, a, mechanism, the, coupler, that, couples, manuals, together, so, that, a, single, manual, plays, both, sets, of, strings, the, most, flexible, system, is, the, french, shove, coupler, in, which, the, lower, manual, slides, forward, and, backward, in, the, backward, position, dogs, attached, to, the, upper, surface, of, the, lower, manual, engage, the, lower, surface, of, the, upper, manual, s, keys, depending, on, choice, of, keyboard, and, coupler, position, the, player, can, select, any, of, the, sets, of, jacks, labeled, in, figure, 4, as, a, or, b, and, c, or, all, three, the, english, dogleg, jack, system, also, used, in, baroque, flanders, does, not, require, a, coupler, the, jacks, labeled, a, in, figure, 5, have, a, dogleg, shape, that, permits, either, keyboard, to, play, a, if, the, player, wishes, to, play, the, upper, 8, from, the, upper, manual, only, and, not, from, the, lower, manual, a, stop, handle, disengages, the, jacks, labeled, a, and, engages, instead, an, alternative, row, of, jacks, called, lute, stop, not, shown, in, the, figure, a, lute, stop, is, used, to, imitate, the, gentle, sound, of, a, plucked, lute, the, use, of, multiple, manuals, in, a, harpsichord, was, not, originally, provided, for, the, flexibility, in, choosing, which, strings, would, sound, but, rather, for, transposition, of, the, instrument, to, play, in, different, keys, see, history, of, the, harpsichord, some, early, harpsichords, used, a, short, octave, for, the, lowest, register, the, rationale, behind, this, system, was, that, the, low, notes, f, and, g, are, seldom, needed, in, early, music, deep, bass, notes, typically, form, the, root, of, the, chord, and, f, and, g, chords, were, seldom, used, at, this, time, in, contrast, low, c, and, d, both, roots, of, very, common, chords, are, sorely, missed, if, a, harpsichord, with, lowest, key, e, is, tuned, to, match, the, keyboard, layout, when, scholars, specify, the, pitch, range, of, instruments, with, this, kind, of, short, octave, they, write, c, e, meaning, that, the, lowest, note, is, a, c, played, on, a, key, that, normally, would, sound, e, in, another, arrangement, known, as, g, b, the, apparent, lowest, key, b, is, tuned, to, g, and, apparent, c, sharp, and, d, sharp, are, tuned, to, a, and, b, respectively, the, wooden, case, holds, in, position, all, of, the, important, structural, members, pinblock, soundboard, hitchpins, keyboard, and, the, jack, action, it, usually, includes, a, solid, bottom, and, also, internal, bracing, to, maintain, its, form, without, warping, under, the, tension, of, the, strings, cases, vary, greatly, in, weight, and, sturdiness, italian, harpsichords, are, often, of, light, construction, heavier, construction, is, found, in, the, later, flemish, instruments, and, those, derived, from, them, the, case, also, gives, the, harpsichord, its, external, appearance, and, protects, the, instrument, a, large, harpsichord, is, in, a, sense, a, piece, of, furniture, as, it, stands, alone, on, legs, and, may, be, styled, in, the, manner, of, other, furniture, of, its, place, and, period, early, italian, instruments, on, the, other, hand, were, so, light, in, construction, that, they, were, treated, rather, like, a, violin, kept, for, storage, in, a, protective, outer, case, and, played, after, taking, it, out, of, its, case, and, placing, it, on, a, table, such, tables, were, often, quite, high, until, the, late, 18th, century, people, usually, played, standing, up, eventually, harpsichords, came, to, be, built, with, just, a, single, case, though, an, intermediate, stage, also, existed, the, false, inner, outer, which, for, purely, aesthetic, reasons, was, built, to, look, as, if, the, outer, case, contained, an, inner, one, in, the, old, style, even, after, harpsichords, became, self, encased, objects, they, often, were, supported, by, separate, stands, and, some, modern, harpsichords, have, separate, legs, for, improved, portability, many, harpsichords, have, a, lid, that, can, be, raised, a, cover, for, the, keyboard, and, a, music, stand, for, holding, sheet, music, and, scores, harpsichords, have, been, decorated, in, a, great, many, different, ways, with, plain, buff, paint, e, g, some, flemish, instruments, with, paper, printed, with, patterns, with, leather, or, velvet, coverings, with, chinoiserie, or, occasionally, with, highly, elaborate, painted, artwork, the, virginal, is, a, smaller, and, simpler, rectangular, form, of, the, harpsichord, having, only, one, string, per, note, the, strings, run, parallel, to, the, keyboard, which, is, on, the, long, side, of, the, case, a, spinet, is, a, harpsichord, with, the, strings, set, at, an, angle, usually, about, 30, degrees, to, the, keyboard, the, strings, are, too, close, together, for, the, jacks, to, fit, between, them, instead, the, strings, are, arranged, in, pairs, and, the, jacks, are, in, the, larger, gaps, between, the, pairs, the, two, jacks, in, each, gap, face, in, opposite, directions, and, each, plucks, a, string, adjacent, to, the, gap, the, english, diarist, samuel, pepys, mentions, his, tryangle, several, times, this, was, not, the, percussion, instrument, that, we, call, triangle, today, rather, it, was, a, name, for, octave, pitched, spinets, which, were, triangular, in, shape, a, clavicytherium, is, a, harpsichord, with, the, soundboard, and, strings, mounted, vertically, facing, the, player, the, same, space, saving, principle, as, an, upright, piano, in, a, clavicytherium, the, jacks, move, horizontally, without, the, assistance, of, gravity, so, that, clavicytherium, actions, are, more, complex, than, those, of, other, harpsichords, ottavini, are, small, spinets, or, virginals, at, four, foot, pitch, harpsichords, at, octave, pitch, were, more, common, in, the, early, renaissance, but, lessened, in, popularity, later, on, however, the, ottavino, remained, very, popular, as, a, domestic, instrument, in, italy, until, the, 19th, century, in, the, low, countries, an, ottavino, was, commonly, paired, with, an, 8, virginals, encased, in, a, small, cubby, under, the, soundboard, of, the, larger, instrument, the, ottavino, could, be, removed, and, placed, on, top, of, the, virginal, making, in, effect, a, double, manual, instrument, these, are, sometimes, called, mother, and, child, or, double, virginals, occasionally, harpsichords, were, built, which, included, another, set, or, sets, of, strings, underneath, and, played, by, foot, operated, pedal, keyboard, which, trigger, the, plucking, of, the, lowest, pitched, keys, of, the, harpsichord, although, there, are, no, known, extant, pedal, harpsichords, from, the, 18th, century, or, before, from, adlung, 1758, the, lower, set, of, usually, 8, strings, is, built, like, an, ordinary, harpsichord, but, with, an, extent, of, two, octaves, only, the, jacks, are, similar, but, they, will, benefit, from, being, arranged, back, to, back, since, the, two, octaves, take, as, much, space, as, four, in, an, ordinary, harpsichord, prior, to, 1980, when, keith, hill, introduced, his, design, for, a, pedal, harpsichord, most, pedal, harpsichords, were, built, based, on, the, designs, of, extant, pedal, pianos, from, the, 19th, century, in, which, the, instrument, is, as, wide, as, the, pedalboard, while, these, were, mostly, intended, as, practice, instruments, for, organists, a, few, pieces, are, believed, to, have, been, written, specifically, for, the, pedal, harpsichord, however, the, set, of, pedals, can, augment, the, sound, from, any, piece, performed, on, the, instrument, as, demonstrated, on, several, albums, by, e, power, biggs, the, archicembalo, built, in, the, 16th, century, had, an, unusual, keyboard, layout, designed, to, accommodate, variant, tuning, systems, demanded, by, compositional, practice, and, theoretical, experimentation, more, common, were, instruments, with, split, sharps, also, designed, to, accommodate, the, tuning, systems, of, the, time, the, folding, harpsichord, was, an, instrument, that, could, be, folded, up, to, make, it, more, compact, thus, facilitating, travelling, with, it, on, the, whole, earlier, harpsichords, have, smaller, ranges, than, later, ones, although, there, are, many, exceptions, the, largest, harpsichords, have, a, range, of, just, over, five, octaves, and, the, smallest, have, under, four, usually, the, shortest, keyboards, were, given, extended, range, in, the, bass, with, a, short, octave, the, traditional, pitch, range, for, a, 5, octave, instrument, is, f, 1, f, 6, ff, f, tuning, pitch, is, often, taken, to, be, a, 4, 415, hz, roughly, a, semitone, lower, than, the, modern, standard, concert, pitch, of, a, 4, 440, hz, an, accepted, exception, is, for, french, baroque, repertoire, which, is, often, performed, with, a, 392, hz, approximately, a, semitone, lower, again, see, jean, philippe, rameau, s, treatise, on, harmony, 1722, book, one, chapter, five, for, insight, into, french, baroque, tuning, since, most, of, these, semitones, are, absolutely, necessary, in, the, tuning, of, organs, and, other, similar, instruments, the, following, chromatic, system, has, been, drawn, up, tuning, an, instrument, nowadays, usually, starts, with, setting, an, a, historically, it, would, commence, from, a, c, or, an, f, the, harpsichord, uses, the, bass, clef, f, clef, some, modern, instruments, are, built, with, keyboards, that, can, shift, sideways, allowing, the, player, to, align, the, mechanism, with, strings, at, either, a, 415, hz, or, a, 440, hz, if, a, tuning, other, than, equal, temperament, is, used, the, instrument, requires, retuning, once, the, keyboard, is, shifted, the, great, bulk, of, the, standard, repertoire, for, the, harpsichord, was, written, during, its, first, historical, flowering, the, renaissance, and, baroque, eras, the, first, music, written, specifically, for, solo, harpsichord, was, published, around, the, early, 16th, century, composers, who, wrote, solo, harpsichord, music, were, numerous, during, the, whole, baroque, era, in, european, countries, including, italy, germany, england, and, france, solo, harpsichord, compositions, included, dance, suites, fantasias, and, fugues, among, the, most, famous, composers, who, wrote, for, the, harpsichord, were, the, members, of, english, virginal, school, of, the, late, renaissance, notably, william, byrd, c, 1540, 1623, in, france, a, great, number, of, highly, characteristic, solo, works, were, created, and, compiled, into, four, books, of, ordres, by, fran, ois, couperin, 1668, 1733, domenico, scarlatti, 1685, 1757, began, his, career, in, italy, but, wrote, most, of, his, solo, harpsichord, works, in, spain, his, most, famous, work, is, his, series, of, 555, harpsichord, sonatas, perhaps, the, most, celebrated, composers, who, wrote, for, the, harpsichord, were, georg, friedrich, h, ndel, 1685, 1759, who, composed, numerous, suites, for, harpsichord, and, especially, j, s, bach, 1685, 1750, whose, solo, works, for, instance, the, well, tempered, clavier, and, the, goldberg, variations, continue, to, be, performed, very, widely, often, on, the, piano, bach, was, also, a, pioneer, of, the, harpsichord, concerto, both, in, works, designated, as, such, and, in, the, harpsichord, part, of, his, fifth, brandenburg, concerto, two, of, the, most, prominent, composers, of, the, classical, era, joseph, haydn, 1732, 1809, and, wolfgang, amadeus, mozart, 1756, 1791, wrote, harpsichord, music, for, both, the, instrument, featured, in, the, earlier, period, of, their, careers, and, although, they, had, come, into, contact, with, the, piano, later, on, they, nonetheless, continued, to, play, the, harpsichord, and, clavichord, for, the, rest, of, their, lives, mozart, was, noted, to, have, played, his, second, last, keyboard, concerto, the, coronation, on, the, harpsichord, through, the, 19th, century, the, harpsichord, was, almost, completely, supplanted, by, the, piano, in, the, 20th, century, composers, returned, to, the, instrument, as, they, sought, out, variation, in, the, sounds, available, to, them, under, the, influence, of, arnold, dolmetsch, the, harpsichordists, violet, gordon, woodhouse, 1872, 1951, and, in, france, wanda, landowska, 1879, 1959, were, at, the, forefront, of, the, instrument, s, renaissance, concertos, for, the, instrument, were, written, by, francis, poulenc, the, concert, champ, tre, 1927, 28, and, manuel, de, falla, elliott, carter, s, double,
