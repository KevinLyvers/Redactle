painting, s, name, since, the, word, qingming, may, refer, to, either, peace, and, order, or, to, the, qingming, festival, other, translations, have, been, suggested, during, the, late, 1960s, the, taipei, palace, museum, released, a, series, of, books, later, digitized, as, cd, rom, videos, and, stamps, about, the, scroll, that, translated, it, loosely, as, a, city, of, cathay, some, scholars, now, question, three, things, that, had, long, been, accepted, about, the, song, dynasty, original, that, the, city, depicted, is, kaifeng, that, it, was, painted, before, the, fall, of, the, northern, song, dynasty, in, 1127, and, that, it, depicts, the, qingming, festival, some, suggest, that, the, city, is, an, idealized, city, of, the, mind, that, it, was, painted, after, the, fall, of, the, dynasty, in, 1127, and, that, it, depicts, a, scene, in, early, autumn, however, other, scholars, view, that, the, city, is, indeed, kaifeng, but, that, the, painting, depicts, a, day, in, the, qingming, solar, term, of, the, chinese, calendar, not, the, qingming, festival, an, allegorical, interpretation, proposed, that, the, painting, was, a, subtle, entreaty, to, the, emperor, that, he, recognize, dangerous, currents, beneath, the, surface, of, prosperity, kaifeng, depended, on, grain, from, the, far, south, but, the, painting, showed, only, a, lowly, official, on, duty, at, the, docks, only, a, few, guards, stationed, at, the, city, gate, and, the, docks, who, did, not, appear, to, be, alert, the, term, qingming, did, not, refer, to, either, the, holiday, or, the, calendar, but, was, taken, from, the, phrase, a, bright, and, enlightened, era, from, the, book, of, the, later, han, and, used, ironically, the, wooden, bridge, depicted, in, the, original, version, was, reconstructed, by, a, team, of, engineers, and, documented, by, the, pbs, television, show, nova, during, their, secrets, of, lost, empires, series
