the, epic, of, gilgamesh, l, m, is, an, epic, from, ancient, mesopotamia, the, literary, history, of, gilgamesh, begins, with, five, sumerian, poems, about, gilgamesh, formerly, read, as, sumerian, bilgames, king, of, uruk, some, of, which, may, date, back, to, the, third, dynasty, of, ur, c, 2100, bc, these, independent, stories, were, later, used, as, source, material, for, a, combined, epic, in, akkadian, the, first, surviving, version, of, this, combined, epic, known, as, the, old, babylonian, version, dates, back, to, the, 18th, century, bc, and, is, titled, after, its, incipit, sh, tur, eli, sharr, surpassing, all, other, kings, only, a, few, tablets, of, it, have, survived, the, later, standard, babylonian, version, compiled, by, s, n, l, qi, unninni, dates, to, somewhere, between, the, 13th, to, the, 10th, centuries, bc, and, bears, the, incipit, sha, naqba, muru, he, who, saw, the, deep, s, lit, he, who, sees, the, unknown, approximately, two, thirds, of, this, longer, twelve, tablet, version, have, been, recovered, some, of, the, best, copies, were, discovered, in, the, library, ruins, of, the, 7th, century, bc, assyrian, king, ashurbanipal, the, first, half, of, the, story, discusses, gilgamesh, who, was, king, of, uruk, and, enkidu, a, wild, man, created, by, the, gods, to, stop, gilgamesh, from, oppressing, the, people, of, uruk, after, enkidu, becomes, civilized, through, sexual, initiation, with, shamhat, he, travels, to, uruk, where, he, challenges, gilgamesh, to, a, test, of, strength, gilgamesh, wins, the, contest, nonetheless, the, two, become, friends, together, they, make, a, six, day, journey, to, the, legendary, cedar, forest, where, they, ultimately, slay, its, guardian, humbaba, and, cut, down, the, sacred, cedar, the, goddess, ishtar, sends, the, bull, of, heaven, to, punish, gilgamesh, for, spurning, her, advances, gilgamesh, and, enkidu, kill, the, bull, of, heaven, insulting, ishtar, in, the, process, after, which, the, gods, decide, to, sentence, enkidu, to, death, and, kill, him, by, giving, him, a, fatal, illness, in, the, second, half, of, the, epic, distress, over, enkidu, s, death, causes, gilgamesh, to, undertake, a, long, and, perilous, journey, to, discover, the, secret, of, eternal, life, he, eventually, learns, that, life, which, you, look, for, you, will, never, find, for, when, the, gods, created, man, they, let, death, be, his, share, and, life, withheld, in, their, own, hands, the, epic, is, regarded, as, a, foundational, work, in, religion, and, the, tradition, of, heroic, sagas, with, gilgamesh, forming, the, prototype, for, later, heroes, like, heracles, hercules, and, the, epic, itself, serving, as, an, influence, for, homeric, epics, it, has, been, translated, into, many, languages, and, is, featured, in, several, works, of, popular, fiction, this, discovery, is, evidently, destined, to, excite, a, lively, controversy, for, the, present, the, orthodox, people, are, in, great, delight, and, are, very, much, prepossessed, by, the, corroboration, which, it, affords, to, biblical, history, it, is, possible, however, as, has, been, pointed, out, that, the, chaldean, inscription, if, genuine, may, be, regarded, as, a, confirmation, of, the, statement, that, there, are, various, traditions, of, the, deluge, apart, from, the, biblical, one, which, is, perhaps, legendary, like, the, rest, the, new, york, times, front, page, 1872, about, 15, 000, fragments, of, assyrian, cuneiform, tablets, were, discovered, in, the, library, of, ashurbanipal, in, nineveh, by, austen, henry, layard, his, assistant, hormuzd, rassam, and, w, k, loftus, in, the, early, 1850s, late, in, the, following, decade, the, british, museum, hired, george, smith, to, study, these, in, 1872, smith, read, translated, fragments, before, the, society, of, biblical, archaeology, and, in, 1875, and, 1876, he, published, fuller, translations, the, latter, of, which, was, published, as, the, chaldaean, account, of, genesis, the, central, character, of, gilgamesh, was, initially, reintroduced, to, the, world, as, izdubar, before, the, cuneiform, logographs, in, his, name, could, be, pronounced, accurately, in, 1891, paul, haupt, collected, the, cuneiform, text, and, nine, years, later, peter, jensen, provided, a, comprehensive, edition, r, campbell, thompson, updated, both, of, their, work, in, 1930, over, the, next, two, decades, samuel, noah, kramer, reassembled, the, sumerian, poems, in, 1998, american, assyriologist, theodore, kwasman, discovered, a, piece, believed, to, have, contained, the, first, lines, of, the, epic, in, the, storeroom, of, the, british, museum, the, fragment, found, in, 1878, and, dated, to, between, 600, bc, and, 100, bc, had, remained, unexamined, by, experts, for, more, than, a, century, since, its, recovery, the, fragment, read, he, who, saw, all, who, was, the, foundation, of, the, land, who, knew, everything, was, wise, in, all, matters, gilgamesh, the, discovery, of, artifacts, c, 2600, bc, associated, with, enmebaragesi, of, kish, mentioned, in, the, legends, as, the, father, of, one, of, gilgamesh, s, adversaries, has, lent, credibility, to, the, historical, existence, of, gilgamesh, in, the, early, 2000s, the, gilgamesh, dream, tablet, was, imported, illegally, into, the, united, states, according, to, the, united, states, department, of, justice, the, tablet, was, encrusted, with, dirt, and, unreadable, when, it, was, purchased, by, a, us, antiquities, dealer, in, 2003, the, tablet, was, sold, by, an, unnamed, antiques, dealer, in, 2007, with, a, letter, falsely, stating, that, it, had, been, inside, a, box, of, ancient, bronze, fragments, purchased, in, a, 1981, auction, in, 2014, hobby, lobby, privately, purchased, the, tablet, for, display, at, the, museum, of, the, bible, in, washington, d, c, in, 2019, the, gilgamesh, dream, tablet, was, seized, by, us, officials, and, was, returned, to, iraq, in, september, 2021, recent, developments, in, the, use, of, artificial, intelligence, software, have, vastly, accelerated, the, process, of, uncovering, new, fragments, of, the, epic, dispersed, and, often, unread, in, museums, around, the, world, distinct, sources, exist, from, over, a, 2000, year, timeframe, the, earliest, sumerian, poems, are, now, generally, considered, to, be, distinct, stories, rather, than, parts, of, a, single, epic, some, of, these, may, date, back, to, as, early, as, the, third, dynasty, of, ur, c, 2100, bc, the, old, babylonian, tablets, c, 1800, bc, are, the, earliest, surviving, tablets, for, a, single, epic, of, gilgamesh, narrative, the, older, old, babylonian, tablets, and, later, akkadian, version, are, important, sources, for, modern, translations, with, the, earlier, texts, mainly, used, to, fill, in, gaps, lacunae, in, the, later, texts, although, several, revised, versions, based, on, new, discoveries, have, been, published, the, epic, remains, incomplete, analysis, of, the, old, babylonian, text, has, been, used, to, reconstruct, possible, earlier, forms, of, the, epic, the, most, recent, akkadian, version, also, referred, to, as, the, standard, babylonian, version, consists, of, twelve, tablets, and, was, edited, by, s, n, l, qi, unninni, who, is, thought, to, have, lived, sometime, between, 1300, bc, and, 1000, bc, from, the, diverse, sources, found, two, main, versions, of, the, epic, have, been, partially, reconstructed, the, standard, babylonian, version, or, he, who, saw, the, deep, and, the, old, babylonian, version, or, surpassing, all, other, kings, five, earlier, sumerian, poems, about, gilgamesh, have, been, partially, recovered, some, with, primitive, versions, of, specific, episodes, in, the, babylonian, version, others, with, unrelated, stories, the, standard, babylonian, version, was, discovered, by, hormuzd, rassam, in, the, library, of, ashurbanipal, in, nineveh, in, 1853, standard, babylonian, refers, to, a, literary, style, that, was, used, for, literary, purposes, this, version, was, compiled, by, sin, leqi, unninni, sometime, between, 1300, and, 1000, bc, from, earlier, texts, one, impact, that, sin, leqi, unninni, brought, to, the, work, was, to, bring, the, issue, of, mortality, to, the, foreground, thus, making, it, possible, for, the, character, to, move, from, being, an, adventurer, to, a, wise, man, the, brazilian, scholar, lins, brand, o, saw, the, standard, version, can, be, seen, in, this, sense, as, sapiential, literature, wisdom, literature, which, is, common, in, the, middle, east, but, this, idea, has, not, been, widely, accepted, the, standard, babylonian, version, has, different, opening, words, or, incipit, from, the, older, version, the, older, version, begins, with, the, words, surpassing, all, other, kings, while, the, standard, babylonian, version, has, he, who, saw, the, deep, a, naqba, muru, deep, referring, to, the, mysteries, of, the, information, brought, back, by, gilgamesh, from, his, meeting, with, uta, napishti, utnapishtim, about, ea, the, fountain, of, wisdom, gilgamesh, was, given, knowledge, of, how, to, worship, the, gods, why, death, was, ordained, for, human, beings, what, makes, a, good, king, and, how, to, live, a, good, life, the, story, of, utnapishtim, the, hero, of, the, flood, myth, can, also, be, found, in, the, babylonian, epic, of, atra, hasis, the, standard, version, is, also, known, as, i, kar, gilg, me, series, of, gilgamesh, the, 12th, tablet, is, a, sequel, to, the, original, 11, and, was, probably, appended, at, a, later, date, it, bears, little, relation, to, the, well, crafted, 11, tablet, epic, the, lines, at, the, beginning, of, the, first, tablet, are, quoted, at, the, end, of, the, 11th, tablet, giving, it, circularity, and, finality, tablet, 12, is, a, near, copy, of, an, earlier, sumerian, tale, a, prequel, in, which, gilgamesh, sends, enkidu, to, retrieve, some, objects, of, his, from, the, underworld, and, he, returns, in, the, form, of, a, spirit, to, relate, the, nature, of, the, underworld, to, gilgamesh, in, terms, of, form, the, poetic, conventions, followed, in, the, standard, babylonian, version, appear, to, be, inconsistent, and, are, still, controversial, among, scholars, there, is, however, extensive, use, of, parallelism, across, sets, of, two, or, three, adjacent, lines, much, like, in, the, hebrew, psalms, when, it, was, discovered, in, the, 19th, century, the, story, of, gilgamesh, was, classified, as, a, greek, epic, a, genre, known, in, europe, even, though, it, predates, the, greek, culture, that, spawned, epics, specifically, when, herodotus, referred, to, the, works, of, homer, in, this, way, when, alfred, jeremias, translated, the, text, he, insisted, on, the, relationship, to, genesis, by, giving, the, title, izdubar, nimrod, and, by, recognizing, the, genre, as, that, of, greek, heroic, poetry, although, the, relationship, to, nimrod, was, dropped, the, view, of, greek, epic, was, retained, martin, litchfield, west, in, 1966, in, the, preface, to, his, edition, of, hesiod, recognized, the, proximity, of, the, greeks, to, the, middle, eastern, center, of, convergence, greek, literature, is, a, near, east, literature, considering, how, the, text, would, be, viewed, from, the, standpoint, of, its, time, is, tricky, as, george, smith, acknowledges, that, there, is, no, sumerian, or, akkadian, word, for, myth, or, heroic, narrative, just, as, there, is, no, ancient, recognition, of, poetic, narrative, as, a, genre, lins, brand, o, 2019, suggested, though, with, little, supporting, evidence, that, the, prologue, of, he, who, saw, the, abyss, recalls, the, inspiration, of, the, greek, muses, even, though, there, is, no, assistance, from, the, sumerian, gods, here, in, more, popular, treatments, sir, jonathan, sacks, neil, mcgregor, and, bbc, radio, 4, interpret, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, s, flood, myth, as, having, a, pantheon, of, gods, who, are, misanthropes, willing, to, condemn, humanity, to, death, with, the, exception, of, ea, such, an, interpretation, is, an, unhelpful, contemporary, take, on, mesopotamia, s, polytheistic, religion, and, on, polytheistic, systems, more, generally, in, which, the, gods, may, be, helpful, or, harmful, in, diverse, situations, it, is, also, made, explicit, that, gilgamesh, rose, to, the, rank, of, an, ancient, wise, man, antediluvian, lins, brand, o, continues, noting, how, the, poem, would, have, been, put, on, a, stele, nar, that, at, first, nar, could, be, seen, as, the, genre, of, the, poem, taking, into, consideration, that, the, reader, or, scribe, would, have, to, pass, the, text, on, without, omitting, or, adding, anything, this, summary, is, based, on, andrew, george, s, translation, the, story, introduces, gilgamesh, king, of, uruk, gilgamesh, two, thirds, god, and, one, third, man, is, oppressing, his, people, who, cry, out, to, the, gods, for, help, for, the, young, women, of, uruk, this, oppression, takes, the, form, of, a, droit, du, seigneur, or, lord, s, right, to, sleep, with, brides, on, their, wedding, night, for, the, young, men, the, tablet, is, damaged, at, this, point, it, is, conjectured, that, gilgamesh, exhausts, them, through, games, tests, of, strength, or, perhaps, forced, labour, on, building, projects, the, gods, respond, to, the, people, s, pleas, by, creating, an, equal, to, gilgamesh, who, will, be, able, to, stop, his, oppression, this, is, enkidu, who, is, covered, in, hair, and, lives, in, the, wild, he, is, spotted, by, a, trapper, whose, livelihood, is, being, ruined, because, enkidu, is, uprooting, his, traps, the, trapper, tells, the, sun, god, shamash, about, the, man, and, it, is, arranged, for, enkidu, to, be, seduced, by, shamhat, a, temple, prostitute, his, first, step, towards, being, tamed, after, six, days, and, seven, nights, or, two, weeks, according, to, more, recent, scholarship, of, lovemaking, and, teaching, enkidu, about, the, ways, of, civilization, she, takes, enkidu, to, a, shepherd, s, camp, to, learn, how, to, be, civilized, gilgamesh, meanwhile, has, been, having, dreams, about, the, imminent, arrival, of, a, beloved, new, companion, and, asks, his, mother, the, goddess, ninsun, to, help, interpret, these, dreams, shamhat, brings, enkidu, to, the, shepherds, camp, where, he, is, introduced, to, a, human, diet, and, becomes, the, night, watchman, learning, from, a, passing, stranger, about, gilgamesh, s, treatment, of, new, brides, enkidu, is, incensed, and, travels, to, uruk, to, intervene, at, a, wedding, when, gilgamesh, attempts, to, visit, the, wedding, chamber, enkidu, blocks, his, way, and, they, fight, after, a, fierce, battle, enkidu, acknowledges, gilgamesh, s, superior, strength, and, they, become, friends, gilgamesh, proposes, a, journey, to, the, cedar, forest, to, slay, the, monstrous, demi, god, humbaba, in, order, to, gain, fame, and, renown, despite, warnings, from, enkidu, and, the, council, of, elders, gilgamesh, is, not, deterred, the, elders, give, gilgamesh, advice, for, his, journey, gilgamesh, visits, his, mother, ninsun, who, seeks, the, support, and, protection, of, the, sun, god, shamash, for, their, adventure, ninsun, adopts, enkidu, as, her, son, and, gilgamesh, leaves, instructions, for, the, governance, of, uruk, in, his, absence, gilgamesh, and, enkidu, journey, to, the, cedar, forest, every, few, days, they, camp, on, a, mountain, and, perform, a, dream, ritual, gilgamesh, has, five, terrifying, dreams, about, falling, mountains, thunderstorms, wild, bulls, and, a, thunderbird, that, breathes, fire, despite, similarities, between, his, dream, figures, and, earlier, descriptions, of, humbaba, enkidu, interprets, these, dreams, as, good, omens, and, denies, that, the, frightening, images, represent, the, forest, guardian, as, they, approach, the, cedar, mountain, they, hear, humbaba, bellowing, and, have, to, encourage, each, other, not, to, be, afraid, the, heroes, enter, the, cedar, forest, humbaba, the, guardian, of, the, cedar, forest, insults, and, threatens, them, he, accuses, enkidu, of, betrayal, and, vows, to, disembowel, gilgamesh, and, feed, his, flesh, to, the, birds, gilgamesh, is, afraid, but, with, some, encouraging, words, from, enkidu, the, battle, commences, the, mountains, quake, with, the, tumult, and, the, sky, turns, black, the, god, shamash, sends, 13, winds, to, bind, humbaba, and, he, is, captured, humbaba, pleads, for, his, life, and, gilgamesh, pities, him, he, offers, to, make, gilgamesh, king, of, the, forest, to, cut, the, trees, for, him, and, to, be, his, slave, enkidu, however, argues, that, gilgamesh, should, kill, humbaba, to, establish, his, reputation, forever, humbaba, curses, them, both, and, gilgamesh, dispatches, him, with, a, blow, to, the, neck, as, well, as, killing, his, seven, sons, the, two, heroes, cut, down, many, cedars, including, a, gigantic, tree, that, enkidu, plans, to, fashion, into, a, gate, for, the, temple, of, enlil, they, build, a, raft, and, return, home, along, the, euphrates, with, the, giant, tree, and, possibly, the, head, of, humbaba, gilgamesh, rejects, the, advances, of, the, goddess, ishtar, because, of, her, mistreatment, of, previous, lovers, like, dumuzi, ishtar, becomes, angry, and, denies, gilgamesh, entry, into, e, ana, interfering, with, his, business, ishtar, asks, her, father, anu, to, send, gulaana, the, bull, of, heaven, to, avenge, her, when, anu, rejects, her, complaints, ishtar, threatens, to, raise, the, dead, who, will, outnumber, the, living, and, devour, them, as, well, as, screaming, loud, enough, to, be, heard, by, the, heavens, and, earth, anu, states, that, if, he, gives, her, the, bull, of, heaven, uruk, will, face, 7, years, of, famine, ishtar, provides, him, with, provisions, for, 7, years, in, exchange, for, the, bull, ishtar, leads, the, bull, of, heaven, to, uruk, and, he, causes, widespread, devastation, drinking, continuously, without, being, satisfied, the, bull, lowers, the, level, of, the, euphrates, river, and, dries, up, the, marshes, he, opens, up, huge, pits, that, swallow, 300, men, without, any, divine, assistance, enkidu, and, gilgamesh, murder, him, and, offer, up, his, heart, to, shamash, when, ishtar, cries, out, enkidu, hurls, one, of, the, hindquarters, of, the, bull, at, her, the, city, of, uruk, celebrates, but, enkidu, has, an, ominous, dream, about, his, future, failure, in, enkidu, s, dream, the, gods, decide, that, one, of, the, heroes, must, die, because, they, killed, humbaba, and, the, bull, of, heaven, despite, the, protestations, of, shamash, enkidu, is, marked, for, death, enkidu, curses, the, great, door, he, has, fashioned, for, enlil, s, temple, he, also, curses, the, trapper, and, shamhat, for, removing, him, from, the, wild, shamash, reminds, enkidu, of, how, shamhat, fed, and, clothed, him, and, introduced, him, to, gilgamesh, shamash, tells, him, that, gilgamesh, will, bestow, great, honors, upon, him, at, his, funeral, and, will, wander, into, the, wild, consumed, with, grief, enkidu, regrets, his, curses, and, blesses, shamhat, instead, in, a, second, dream, however, he, sees, himself, being, taken, captive, to, the, netherworld, a, house, of, dust, and, darkness, whose, inhabitants, eat, clay, and, are, clothed, in, bird, feathers, supervised, by, terrifying, beings, for, 12, days, enkidu, s, condition, worsens, finally, after, a, lament, that, he, could, not, meet, a, heroic, death, in, battle, he, dies, in, a, famous, line, from, the, epic, gilgamesh, clings, to, enkidu, s, body, and, denies, that, he, has, died, until, a, maggot, drops, from, the, nose, of, the, corpse, gilgamesh, delivers, a, lament, for, enkidu, in, which, he, calls, upon, mountains, forests, fields, rivers, wild, animals, and, all, of, uruk, to, mourn, for, his, friend, recalling, their, adventures, together, gilgamesh, tears, at, his, hair, and, clothes, in, grief, he, commissions, a, funerary, statue, and, provides, grave, gifts, from, his, treasury, to, ensure, that, enkidu, has, a, favourable, reception, in, the, realm, of, the, dead, a, great, banquet, is, held, where, the, treasures, are, offered, to, the, gods, of, the, netherworld, just, before, a, break, in, the, text, there, is, a, suggestion, that, a, river, is, being, dammed, indicating, a, burial, in, a, river, bed, as, in, the, corresponding, sumerian, poem, the, death, of, gilgamesh, tablet, nine, opens, with, gilgamesh, roaming, the, wild, wearing, skins, grieving, for, enkidu, having, now, become, fearful, of, his, own, death, he, decides, to, seek, utnapishtim, the, faraway, and, learn, the, secret, of, eternal, life, among, the, few, survivors, of, the, great, flood, utnapishtim, and, his, wife, are, the, only, humans, to, have, been, granted, immortality, by, the, gods, gilgamesh, crosses, a, mountain, pass, at, night, and, encounters, a, pride, of, lions, before, sleeping, he, prays, for, protection, to, the, moon, god, sin, then, waking, from, an, encouraging, dream, he, murders, the, lions, and, uses, their, skins, for, clothing, after, a, long, and, perilous, journey, gilgamesh, arrives, at, the, twin, peaks, of, mount, mashu, at, the, end, of, the, earth, he, comes, across, a, tunnel, which, no, man, has, ever, entered, guarded, by, two, scorpion, monsters, who, appear, to, be, a, married, couple, the, husband, tries, to, dissuade, gilgamesh, from, passing, but, the, wife, intervenes, expresses, sympathy, for, gilgamesh, and, according, to, the, poem, s, editor, benjamin, foster, allows, his, passage, he, passes, under, the, mountains, along, the, road, of, the, sun, in, complete, darkness, he, follows, the, road, for, 12, double, hours, managing, to, complete, the, trip, before, the, sun, catches, up, with, him, he, arrives, at, the, garden, of, the, gods, a, paradise, full, of, jewel, laden, trees, gilgamesh, meets, alewife, siduri, who, assumes, that, he, is, a, murderer, or, thief, because, of, his, disheveled, appearance, gilgamesh, tells, her, about, the, purpose, of, his, journey, she, attempts, to, dissuade, him, from, his, quest, but, sends, him, to, urshanabi, the, ferryman, who, will, help, him, cross, the, sea, to, utnapishtim, gilgamesh, out, of, spontaneous, rage, destroys, the, stone, charms, that, urshanabi, keeps, with, him, gilgamesh, tells, his, story, but, when, he, asks, for, help, urshanabi, informs, him, that, he, has, just, destroyed, the, objects, that, can, help, them, cross, the, waters, of, death, which, are, deadly, to, the, touch, urshanabi, instructs, gilgamesh, to, cut, down, 120, trees, and, fashion, them, into, punting, poles, when, they, reach, the, island, where, utnapishtim, lives, gilgamesh, recounts, his, story, asking, him, for, his, help, utnapishtim, reprimands, him, declaring, that, fighting, the, common, fate, of, humans, is, futile, and, diminishes, life, s, joys, gilgamesh, observes, that, utnapishtim, seems, no, different, from, himself, and, asks, him, how, he, obtained, his, immortality, utnapishtim, explains, that, the, gods, decided, to, send, a, great, flood, to, save, utnapishtim, the, god, enki, told, him, to, build, a, boat, he, gave, him, precise, dimensions, and, it, was, sealed, with, pitch, and, bitumen, his, entire, family, went, aboard, together, with, his, craftsmen, and, all, the, animals, of, the, field, a, violent, storm, then, arose, which, caused, the, terrified, gods, to, retreat, to, the, heavens, ishtar, lamented, the, wholesale, destruction, of, humanity, and, the, other, gods, wept, beside, her, the, storm, lasted, six, days, and, nights, after, which, all, the, human, beings, turned, to, clay, utnapishtim, weeps, when, he, sees, the, destruction, his, boat, lodges, on, the, mt, nimush, and, he, releases, a, dove, a, swallow, and, a, raven, when, the, raven, fails, to, return, he, opens, the, ark, and, frees, its, inhabitants, utnapishtim, offers, a, sacrifice, to, the, gods, who, smell, the, sweet, savor, and, gather, around, ishtar, vows, that, just, as, she, will, never, forget, the, brilliant, necklace, that, hangs, around, her, neck, she, will, always, remember, this, time, when, enlil, arrives, angry, that, there, are, survivors, she, condemns, him, for, instigating, the, flood, enki, also, castigates, him, for, sending, a, disproportionate, punishment, enlil, blesses, utnapishtim, and, his, wife, and, rewards, them, with, eternal, life, this, account, largely, matches, the, flood, story, that, concludes, the, epic, of, atra, hasis, the, main, point, seems, to, be, that, when, enlil, granted, eternal, life, it, was, a, unique, gift, as, if, to, demonstrate, this, point, utnapishtim, challenges, gilgamesh, to, stay, awake, for, six, days, and, seven, nights, gilgamesh, falls, asleep, and, utnapishtim, instructs, his, wife, to, bake, a, loaf, of, bread, on, each, of, the, days, he, is, asleep, so, that, he, cannot, deny, his, failure, to, keep, awake, gilgamesh, who, is, seeking, to, overcome, death, cannot, even, conquer, sleep, after, instructing, urshanabi, the, ferryman, to, wash, gilgamesh, and, clothe, him, in, royal, robes, they, depart, for, uruk, as, they, are, leaving, utnapishtim, s, wife, asks, her, husband, to, offer, a, parting, gift, utnapishtim, tells, gilgamesh, that, at, the, bottom, of, the, sea, there, lives, a, boxthorn, like, plant, that, will, make, him, young, again, gilgamesh, by, binding, stones, to, his, feet, so, he, can, walk, on, the, bottom, manages, to, obtain, the, plant, gilgamesh, proposes, to, investigate, if, the, plant, has, the, hypothesized, rejuvenation, ability, by, testing, it, on, an, old, man, once, he, returns, to, uruk, when, gilgamesh, stops, to, bathe, it, is, stolen, by, a, serpent, who, sheds, its, skin, as, it, departs, gilgamesh, weeps, at, the, futility, of, his, efforts, because, he, has, now, lost, all, chance, of, immortality, he, returns, to, uruk, where, the, sight, of, its, massive, walls, prompts, him, to, praise, this, enduring, work, to, urshanabi, this, tablet, is, mainly, an, akkadian, translation, of, an, earlier, sumerian, poem, gilgamesh, and, the, netherworld, also, known, as, gilgamesh, enkidu, and, the, netherworld, and, variants, although, it, has, been, suggested, that, it, is, derived, from, an, unknown, version, of, that, story, the, contents, of, this, last, tablet, are, inconsistent, with, previous, ones, enkidu, is, still, alive, despite, having, died, earlier, in, the, epic, because, of, this, its, lack, of, integration, with, the, other, tablets, and, the, fact, that, it, is, almost, a, copy, of, an, earlier, version, it, has, been, referred, to, as, an, inorganic, appendage, to, the, epic, alternatively, it, has, been, suggested, that, its, purpose, though, crudely, handled, is, to, explain, to, gilgamesh, and, the, reader, the, various, fates, of, the, dead, in, the, afterlife, and, in, an, awkward, attempt, to, bring, closure, it, both, connects, the, gilgamesh, of, the, epic, with, the, gilgamesh, who, is, the, king, of, the, netherworld, and, is, a, dramatic, capstone, whereby, the, twelve, tablet, epic, ends, on, one, and, the, same, theme, that, of, seeing, understanding, discovery, etc, with, which, it, began, gilgamesh, complains, to, enkidu, that, various, of, his, possessions, the, tablet, is, unclear, exactly, what, different, translations, include, a, drum, and, a, ball, have, fallen, into, the, underworld, enkidu, offers, to, bring, them, back, delighted, gilgamesh, tells, enkidu, what, he, must, and, must, not, do, in, the, underworld, if, he, is, to, return, enkidu, does, everything, which, he, was, told, not, to, do, the, underworld, keeps, him, gilgamesh, prays, to, the, gods, to, give, him, back, his, friend, enlil, and, suen, do, not, reply, but, enki, and, shamash, decide, to, help, shamash, makes, a, crack, in, the, earth, and, enkidu, s, ghost, jumps, out, of, it, the, tablet, ends, with, gilgamesh, questioning, enkidu, about, what, he, has, seen, in, the, underworld, this, version, of, the, epic, called, in, some, fragments, surpassing, all, other, kings, is, composed, of, tablets, and, fragments, from, diverse, origins, and, states, of, conservation, it, remains, incomplete, in, its, majority, with, several, tablets, missing, and, those, found, having, sizable, lacunae, they, are, named, after, their, current, location, or, the, place, where, they, were, found, surpassing, all, other, kings, tablet, ii, greatly, correlates, with, tablets, i, ii, of, the, standard, babylonian, version, gilgamesh, tells, his, mother, ninsun, about, two, dreams, he, had, his, mother, explains, that, they, mean, that, a, new, companion, will, soon, arrive, at, uruk, in, the, meanwhile, the, wild, enkidu, and, the, priestess, here, called, shamkatum, have, sex, she, tames, him, in, company, of, the, shepherds, by, offering, him, bread, and, beer, enkidu, helps, the, shepherds, by, guarding, the, sheep, they, travel, to, uruk, to, confront, gilgamesh, and, stop, his, abuses, enkidu, and, gilgamesh, battle, but, gilgamesh, breaks, off, the, fight, enkidu, praises, gilgamesh, surpassing, all, other, kings, tablet, iii, partially, matches, tablets, ii, iii, of, the, standard, babylonian, version, for, reasons, unknown, the, tablet, is, partially, broken, enkidu, is, in, a, sad, mood, in, order, to, cheer, him, up, gilgamesh, suggests, going, to, the, pine, forest, to, cut, down, trees, and, kill, humbaba, known, here, as, huwawa, enkidu, protests, as, he, knows, huwawa, and, is, aware, of, his, power, gilgamesh, talks, enkidu, into, it, with, some, words, of, encouragement, but, enkidu, remains, reluctant, they, prepare, and, call, for, the, elders, the, elders, also, protest, but, after, gilgamesh, talks, to, them, they, agree, to, let, him, go, after, gilgamesh, asks, his, god, shamash, for, protection, and, both, he, and, enkidu, equip, themselves, they, leave, with, the, elders, blessing, and, counsel, possibly, another, version, of, the, contents, of, the, yale, tablet, practically, irrecoverable, in, the, journey, to, the, cedar, forest, and, huwawa, enkidu, interprets, one, of, gilgamesh, s, dreams, fragments, from, two, different, versions, tablets, tell, how, enkidu, interprets, one, of, gilgamesh, s, dreams, on, the, way, to, the, forest, of, cedar, and, their, conversation, when, entering, the, forest, after, defeating, huwawa, gilgamesh, refrains, from, slaying, him, and, urges, enkidu, to, hunt, huwawa, s, seven, auras, enkidu, convinces, him, to, smite, their, enemy, after, killing, huwawa, and, the, auras, they, chop, down, part, of, the, forest, and, discover, the, gods, secret, abode, the, rest, of, the, tablet, is, broken, the, auras, are, not, referred, to, in, the, standard, babylonian, version, but, are, in, one, of, the, sumerian, poems, as, sons, partially, overlapping, the, felling, of, the, trees, from, the, ishchali, tablet, partially, overlapping, the, standard, babylonian, version, tablets, ix, x, gilgamesh, mourns, the, death, of, enkidu, wandering, in, his, quest, for, immortality, gilgamesh, argues, with, shamash, about, the, futility, of, his, quest, after, a, lacuna, gilgamesh, talks, to, siduri, about, his, quest, and, his, journey, to, meet, utnapishtim, here, called, uta, na, ishtim, siduri, attempts, to, dissuade, gilgamesh, in, his, quest, for, immortality, urging, him, to, be, content, with, the, simple, pleasures, of, life, after, one, more, lacuna, gilgamesh, smashes, the, stone, ones, and, talks, to, the, ferryman, urshanabi, here, called, sur, sunabu, after, a, short, discussion, sur, sunabu, asks, him, to, carve, 300, oars, so, that, they, may, cross, the, waters, of, death, without, needing, the, stone, ones, the, rest, of, the, tablet, is, missing, the, text, on, the, old, babylonian, meissner, fragment, the, larger, surviving, fragment, of, the, sippar, tablet, has, been, used, to, reconstruct, possible, earlier, forms, of, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, and, it, has, been, suggested, that, a, prior, form, of, the, story, earlier, even, than, that, preserved, on, the, old, babylonian, fragment, may, well, have, ended, with, siduri, sending, gilgamesh, back, to, uruk, and, utnapistim, was, not, originally, part, of, the, tale, there, are, five, extant, gilgamesh, stories, in, the, form, of, older, poems, in, sumerian, these, probably, circulated, independently, rather, than, being, in, the, form, of, a, unified, epic, some, of, the, names, of, the, main, characters, in, these, poems, differ, slightly, from, later, akkadian, names, for, example, bilgamesh, is, written, instead, of, gilgamesh, and, there, are, some, differences, in, the, underlying, stories, such, as, the, fact, that, enkidu, is, gilgamesh, s, servant, in, the, sumerian, version, the, first, direct, arabic, translation, from, the, original, tablets, was, published, in, the, 1960s, by, iraqi, archaeologist, taha, baqir, the, definitive, modern, translation, into, english, is, a, two, volume, critical, work, by, andrew, george, published, by, oxford, university, press, in, 2003, a, book, review, by, cambridge, scholar, eleanor, robson, claims, that, george, s, is, the, most, significant, critical, work, on, gilgamesh, in, the, last, 70, years, george, discusses, the, state, of, the, surviving, material, and, provides, a, tablet, by, tablet, exegesis, with, a, dual, language, side, by, side, translation, in, 2004, stephen, mitchell, supplied, a, controversial, version, that, takes, many, liberties, with, the, text, and, includes, modernized, allusions, and, commentary, relating, to, the, iraq, war, of, 2003, in, 2021, a, translation, by, sophus, helle, was, published, by, yale, university, press, various, themes, plot, elements, and, characters, in, the, hebrew, bible, have, been, suggested, to, correlate, with, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, notably, the, accounts, of, the, garden, of, eden, the, advice, from, ecclesiastes, and, the, genesis, flood, narrative, the, parallels, between, the, stories, of, enkidu, shamhat, and, adam, eve, have, been, long, recognized, by, scholars, in, both, a, human, is, created, from, the, soil, by, a, god, and, lives, in, nature, he, is, introduced, to, a, female, congener, who, tempts, him, in, both, stories, the, man, accepts, food, from, the, woman, covers, his, nakedness, and, must, leave, his, former, home, unable, to, return, the, presence, of, a, snake, who, steals, a, plant, of, immortality, from, the, hero, later, in, the, epic, is, another, point, of, similarity, however, a, major, difference, between, the, two, stories, is, that, while, enkidu, experiences, regret, regarding, his, seduction, away, from, nature, this, is, only, temporary, after, being, confronted, by, the, god, shamash, for, being, ungrateful, enkidu, recants, and, decides, to, give, the, woman, who, seduced, him, his, final, blessing, before, he, dies, this, is, in, contrast, to, adam, whose, fall, from, grace, is, largely, portrayed, as, a, punishment, for, disobeying, god, and, the, inevitable, consequence, of, the, loss, of, innocence, regarding, good, and, evil, several, scholars, suggest, direct, borrowing, of, siduri, s, advice, by, the, author, of, ecclesiastes, a, rare, proverb, about, the, strength, of, a, triple, stranded, rope, a, triple, stranded, rope, is, not, easily, broken, is, common, to, both, books, andrew, george, submits, that, the, genesis, flood, narrative, matches, that, in, gilgamesh, so, closely, that, few, doubt, that, it, derives, from, a, mesopotamian, account, what, is, particularly, noticeable, is, the, way, the, genesis, flood, story, follows, the, gilgamesh, flood, tale, point, by, point, and, in, the, same, order, even, when, the, story, permits, other, alternatives, in, a, 2001, torah, commentary, released, on, behalf, of, the, conservative, movement, of, judaism, rabbinic, scholar, robert, wexler, stated, the, most, likely, assumption, we, can, make, is, that, both, genesis, and, gilgamesh, drew, their, material, from, a, common, tradition, about, the, flood, that, existed, in, mesopotamia, these, stories, then, diverged, in, the, retelling, ziusudra, utnapishtim, and, noah, are, the, respective, heroes, of, the, sumerian, akkadian, and, biblical, flood, legends, of, the, ancient, near, east, matthias, henze, suggests, that, nebuchadnezzar, s, madness, in, the, biblical, book, of, daniel, draws, on, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, he, claims, that, the, author, uses, elements, from, the, description, of, enkidu, to, paint, a, sarcastic, and, mocking, portrait, of, the, king, of, babylon, many, characters, in, the, epic, have, biblical, parallels, most, notably, ninti, the, sumerian, goddess, of, life, was, created, from, enki, s, rib, to, heal, him, after, he, had, eaten, forbidden, flowers, it, is, suggested, that, this, story, served, as, the, basis, for, the, story, of, eve, created, from, adam, s, rib, in, the, book, of, genesis, esther, j, hamori, in, echoes, of, gilgamesh, in, the, jacob, story, also, claims, that, the, story, of, jacob, and, esau, is, paralleled, with, the, wrestling, match, between, gilgamesh, and, enkidu, gilgamesh, is, mentioned, in, one, version, of, the, book, of, giants, which, is, related, to, the, book, of, enoch, the, book, of, giants, version, found, at, qumran, mentions, the, sumerian, hero, gilgamesh, and, the, monster, humbaba, with, the, watchers, and, giants, numerous, scholars, have, drawn, attention, to, various, themes, episodes, and, verses, indicating, that, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, had, a, substantial, influence, on, both, of, the, epic, poems, ascribed, to, homer, these, influences, are, detailed, by, martin, litchfield, west, in, the, east, face, of, helicon, west, asiatic, elements, in, greek, poetry, and, myth, according, to, tzvi, abusch, of, brandeis, university, the, poem, combines, the, power, and, tragedy, of, the, iliad, with, the, wanderings, and, marvels, of, the, odyssey, it, is, a, work, of, adventure, but, is, no, less, a, meditation, on, some, fundamental, issues, of, human, existence, martin, west, in, the, east, face, of, helicon, speculates, that, the, memory, of, gilgamesh, would, have, reached, the, greeks, through, a, lost, poem, about, heracles, in, the, alexander, romance, and, many, subsequent, legends, of, alexander, the, great, alexander, is, on, a, quest, to, find, the, fountain, of, life, and, become, immortal, this, was, inspired, by, myths, of, gilgamesh, s, quest, for, eternal, youth, in, the, face, of, his, mortality, despite, the, influence, there, are, two, main, differences, the, first, is, that, gilgamesh, seeks, the, plant, of, youth, whereas, alexander, seeks, the, water, of, life, the, second, is, that, the, motif, of, the, snake, shedding, its, skin, in, the, gilgamesh, legend, is, replaced, in, the, alexander, legend, by, a, fish, returning, to, life, upon, being, washed, in, the, fountain, the, reasons, for, these, differences, was, due, to, the, christianizing, force, involved, in, the, adaptation, of, the, gilgamesh, legends, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, has, inspired, many, works, of, literature, art, and, music, it, was, only, after, world, war, i, that, the, gilgamesh, epic, reached, a, modern, audience, and, only, after, world, war, ii, that, it, was, featured, in, a, variety, of, genres, the, hayao, miyazaki, s, 1997, anime, film, princess, mononoke, is, partially, based, on, the, cedar, forest, episode, of, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, translations, outdated, and, other
