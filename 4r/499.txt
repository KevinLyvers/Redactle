maintained, political, affinities, with, radical, politics, on, the, left, wing, and, far, left, politics, there, is, no, consensus, on, the, origin, of, the, movement, s, name, a, common, story, is, that, the, artist, richard, huelsenbeck, slid, a, paper, knife, randomly, into, a, dictionary, where, it, landed, on, dada, a, french, term, for, a, hobby, horse, others, note, it, suggests, the, first, words, of, a, child, evoking, a, childishness, and, absurdity, that, appealed, to, the, group, still, others, speculate, it, might, have, been, chosen, to, evoke, a, similar, meaning, or, no, meaning, at, all, in, any, language, reflecting, the, movement, s, internationalism, the, roots, of, dada, lie, in, pre, war, avant, garde, the, term, anti, art, a, precursor, to, dada, was, coined, by, marcel, duchamp, around, 1913, to, characterize, works, that, challenge, accepted, definitions, of, art, cubism, and, the, development, of, collage, and, abstract, art, would, inform, the, movement, s, detachment, from, the, constraints, of, reality, and, convention, the, work, of, french, poets, italian, futurists, and, german, expressionists, would, influence, dada, s, rejection, of, the, correlation, between, words, and, meaning, works, such, as, ubu, roi, 1896, by, alfred, jarry, and, the, ballet, parade, 1916, 17, by, erik, satie, would, be, characterized, as, proto, dadaist, works, the, dada, movement, s, principles, were, first, collected, in, hugo, ball, s, dada, manifesto, in, 1916, ball, is, seen, as, the, founder, of, the, dada, movement, the, dadaist, movement, included, public, gatherings, demonstrations, and, publication, of, art, and, literary, journals, passionate, coverage, of, art, politics, and, culture, were, topics, often, discussed, in, a, variety, of, media, key, figures, in, the, movement, included, jean, arp, johannes, baader, hugo, ball, marcel, duchamp, max, ernst, elsa, von, freytag, loringhoven, george, grosz, raoul, hausmann, john,

informal, international, movement, with, participants, in, europe, and, north, america, the, beginnings, of, dada, correspond, with, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, for, many, participants, the, movement, was, a, protest, against, the, bourgeois, nationalist, and, colonialist, interests, which, many, dadaists, believed, were, the, root, cause, of, the, war, and, against, the, cultural, and, intellectual, conformity, in, art, and, more, broadly, in, society, that, corresponded, to, the, war, avant, garde, circles, outside, france, knew, of, pre, war, parisian, developments, they, had, seen, or, participated, in, cubist, exhibitions, held, at, galeries, dalmau, barcelona, 1912, galerie, der, sturm, in, berlin, 1912, the, armory, show, in, new, york, 1913, svu, m, nes, in, prague, 1914, several, jack, of, diamonds, exhibitions, in, moscow, and, at, moderne, kunstkring, amsterdam, between, 1911, and, 1915, futurism, developed, in, response, to, the, work, of, various, artists, dada, subsequently, combined, these, approaches, many, dadaists, believed, that, the, reason, and, logic, of, bourgeois, capitalist, society, had, led, people, into, war, they, expressed, their, rejection, of, that, ideology, in, artistic, expression, that, appeared, to, reject, logic, and, embrace, chaos, and, irrationality, for, example, george, grosz, later, recalled, that, his, dadaist, art, was, intended, as, a, protest, against, this, world, of, mutual, destruction, according, to, hans, richter, dada, was, not, art, it, was, anti, art, dada, represented, the, opposite, of, everything, which, art, stood, for, where, art, was, concerned, with, traditional, aesthetics, dada, ignored, aesthetics, if, art, was, to, appeal, to, sensibilities, dada, was, intended, to, offend, additionally, dada, attempted, to, reflect, onto, human, perception, and, the, chaotic, nature, of, society, tristan, tzara, proclaimed, everything, is, dada, too, beware, of, dada, anti, dadaism, is, a, disease, selfkleptomania, man, s, normal, condition, is, dada, but, the, real, dadas, are, against, dada, as, hugo, ball, expressed, it, for, us, art, is, not, an, end, in, itself, but, it, is, an, opportunity, for, the, true, perception, and, criticism, of, the, times, we, live, in, a, reviewer, from, the, american, art, news, stated, at, the, time, that, dada, philosophy, is, the, sickest, most, paralyzing, and, most, destructive, thing, that, has, ever, originated, from, the, brain, of, man, art, historians, have, described, dada, as, being, in, large, part, a, reaction, to, what, many, of, these, artists, saw, as, nothing, more, than, an, insane, spectacle, of, collective, homicide, years, later, dada, artists, described, the, movement, as, a, phenomenon, bursting, forth, in, the, midst, of, the, postwar, economic, and, moral, crisis, a, savior, a, monster, which, would, lay, waste, to, everything, in, its, path, a, systematic, work, of, destruction, and, demoralization, in, the, end, it, became, nothing, but, an, act, of, sacrilege, to, quote, dona, budd, s, the, language, of, art, knowledge, dada, was, born, out, of, negative, reaction, to, the, horrors, of, the, first, world, war, this, international, movement, was, begun, by, a, group, of, artists, and, poets, associated, with, the, cabaret, voltaire, in, z, rich, dada, rejected, reason, and, logic, prizing, nonsense, irrationality, and, intuition, the, origin, of, the, name, dada, is, unclear, some, believe, that, it, is, a, nonsensical, word, others, maintain, that, it, originates, from, the, romanian, artists, tristan, tzara, s, and, marcel, janco, s, frequent, use, of, the, words, da, da, meaning, yes, yes, in, the, romanian, language, another, theory, says, that, the, name, dada, came, during, a, meeting, of, the, group, when, a, paper, knife, stuck, into, a, french, german, dictionary, happened, to, point, to, dada, a, french, word, for, hobbyhorse, the, movement, primarily, involved, visual, arts, literature, poetry, art, manifestos, art, theory, theatre, and, graphic, design, and, concentrated, its, anti, war, politics, through, a, rejection, of, the, prevailing, standards, in, art, through, anti, art, cultural, works, the, creations, of, duchamp, picabia, man, ray, and, others, between, 1915, and, 1917, eluded, the, term, dada, at, the, time, and, new, york, dada, came, to, be, seen, as, a, post, facto, invention, of, duchamp, at, the, outset, of, the, 1920s, the, term, dada, flourished, in, europe, with, the, help, of, duchamp, and, picabia, who, had, both, returned, from, new, york, notwithstanding, dadaists, such, as, tzara, and, richter, claimed, european, precedence, art, historian, david, hopkins, notes, ironically, though, duchamp, s, late, activities, in, new, york, along, with, the, machinations, of, picabia, re, cast, dada, s, history, dada, s, european, chroniclers, primarily, richter, tzara, and, huelsenbeck, would, eventually, become, preoccupied, with, establishing, the, pre, eminence, of, z, rich, and, berlin, at, the, foundations, of, dada, but, it, proved, to, be, duchamp, who, was, most, strategically, brilliant, in, manipulating, the, genealogy, of, this, avant, garde, formation, deftly, turning, new, york, dada, from, a, late, comer, into, an, originating, force, dada, emerged, from, a, period, of, artistic, and, literary, movements, like, futurism, cubism, and, expressionism, centered, mainly, in, italy, france, and, germany, respectively, in, those, years, however, unlike, the, earlier, movements, dada, was, able, to, establish, a, broad, base, of, support, giving, rise, to, a, movement, that, was, international, in, scope, its, adherents, were, based, in, cities, all, over, the, world, including, new, york, z, rich, berlin, paris, and, others, there, were, regional, differences, like, an, emphasis, on, literature, in, z, rich, and, political, protest, in, berlin, prominent, dadaists, published, manifestos, but, the, movement, was, loosely, organized, and, there, was, no, central, hierarchy, on, 14, july, 1916, ball, originated, the, seminal, dada, manifesto, tzara, wrote, a, second, dada, manifesto, considered, important, dada, reading, which, was, published, in, 1918, tzara, s, manifesto, articulated, the, concept, of, dadaist, disgust, the, contradiction, implicit, in, avant, garde, works, between, the, criticism, and, affirmation, of, modernist, reality, in, the, dadaist, perspective, modern, art, and, culture, are, considered, a, type, of, fetishization, where, the, objects, of, consumption, including, organized, systems, of, thought, like, philosophy, and, morality, are, chosen, much, like, a, preference, for, cake, or, cherries, to, fill, a, void, the, shock, and, scandal, the, movement, inflamed, was, deliberate, dadaist, magazines, were, banned, and, their, exhibits, closed, some, of, the, artists, even, faced, imprisonment, these, provocations, were, part, of, the, entertainment, but, over, time, audiences, expectations, eventually, outpaced, the, movement, s, capacity, to, deliver, as, the, artists, well, known, sarcastic, laugh, started, to, come, from, the, audience, the, provocations, of, dadaists, began, to, lose, their, impact, dada, was, an, active, movement, during, years, of, political, turmoil, from, 1916, when, european, countries, were, actively, engaged, in, world, war, i, the, conclusion, of, which, in, 1918, set, the, stage, for, a, new, political, order, there, is, some, disagreement, about, where, dada, originated, the, movement, is, commonly, accepted, by, most, art, historians, and, those, who, lived, during, this, period, to, have, identified, with, the, cabaret, voltaire, housed, inside, the, holl, ndische, meierei, bar, in, z, rich, co, founded, by, poet, and, cabaret, singer, emmy, hennings, and, hugo, ball, some, sources, propose, a, romanian, origin, arguing, that, dada, was, an, offshoot, of, a, vibrant, artistic, tradition, that, transposed, to, switzerland, when, a, group, of, jewish, modernist, artists, including, tristan, tzara, marcel, janco, and, arthur, segal, settled, in, z, rich, before, world, war, i, similar, art, had, already, existed, in, bucharest, and, other, eastern, european, cities, it, is, likely, that, dada, s, catalyst, was, the, arrival, in, z, rich, of, artists, like, tzara, and, janco, the, name, cabaret, voltaire, was, a, reference, to, the, french, philosopher, voltaire, whose, novel, candide, mocked, the, religious, and, philosophical, dogmas, of, the, day, opening, night, was, attended, by, ball, tzara, jean, arp, and, janco, these, artists, along, with, others, like, sophie, taeuber, richard, huelsenbeck, and, hans, richter, started, putting, on, performances, at, the, cabaret, voltaire, and, using, art, to, express, their, disgust, with, the, war, and, the, interests, that, inspired, it, having, left, germany, and, romania, during, world, war, i, the, artists, arrived, in, politically, neutral, switzerland, they, used, abstraction, to, fight, against, the, social, political, and, cultural, ideas, of, that, time, they, used, shock, art, provocation, and, vaudevillian, excess, to, subvert, the, conventions, they, believed, had, caused, the, great, war, the, dadaists, believed, those, ideas, to, be, a, byproduct, of, bourgeois, society, that, was, so, apathetic, it, would, wage, war, against, itself, rather, than, challenge, the, status, quo, we, had, lost, confidence, in, our, culture, everything, had, to, be, demolished, we, would, begin, again, after, the, tabula, rasa, at, the, cabaret, voltaire, we, began, by, shocking, common, sense, public, opinion, education, institutions, museums, good, taste, in, short, the, whole, prevailing, order, ball, said, that, janco, s, mask, and, costume, designs, inspired, by, romanian, folk, art, made, the, horror, of, our, time, the, paralyzing, background, of, events, visible, according, to, ball, performances, were, accompanied, by, a, balalaika, orchestra, playing, delightful, folk, songs, often, influenced, by, african, music, arrhythmic, drumming, and, jazz, were, common, at, dada, gatherings, after, the, cabaret, closed, down, dada, activities, moved, on, to, a, new, gallery, and, hugo, ball, left, for, bern, tzara, began, a, relentless, campaign, to, spread, dada, ideas, he, bombarded, french, and, italian, artists, and, writers, with, letters, and, soon, emerged, as, the, dada, leader, and, master, strategist, the, cabaret, voltaire, re, opened, and, is, still, in, the, same, place, at, the, spiegelgasse, 1, in, the, niederdorf, z, rich, dada, with, tzara, at, the, helm, published, the, art, and, literature, review, dada, beginning, in, july, 1917, with, five, editions, from, z, rich, and, the, final, two, from, paris, other, artists, such, as, andr, breton, and, philippe, soupault, created, literature, groups, to, help, extend, the, influence, of, dada, after, the, fighting, of, the, first, world, war, had, ended, in, the, armistice, of, november, 1918, most, of, the, z, rich, dadaists, returned, to, their, home, countries, and, some, began, dada, activities, in, other, cities, others, such, as, the, swiss, native, sophie, taeuber, would, remain, in, z, rich, into, the, 1920s, berlin, was, a, city, of, tightened, stomachers, of, mounting, thundering, hunger, where, hidden, rage, was, transformed, into, a, boundless, money, lust, and, men, s, minds, were, concentrating, more, and, more, on, questions, of, naked, existence, fear, was, in, everybody, s, bones, richard, h, lsenbeck, raoul, hausmann, who, helped, establish, dada, in, berlin, published, his, manifesto, synthethic, cino, of, painting, in, 1918, where, he, attacked, expressionism, and, the, art, critics, who, promoted, it, dada, is, envisioned, in, contrast, to, art, forms, such, as, expressionism, that, appeal, to, viewers, emotional, states, the, exploitation, of, so, called, echoes, of, the, soul, in, hausmann, s, conception, of, dada, new, techniques, of, creating, art, would, open, doors, to, explore, new, artistic, impulses, fragmented, use, of, real, world, stimuli, allowed, an, expression, of, reality, that, was, radically, different, from, other, forms, of, art, a, child, s, discarded, doll, or, a, brightly, colored, rag, are, more, necessary, expressions, than, those, of, some, ass, who, seeks, to, immortalize, himself, in, oils, in, finite, parlors, the, groups, in, germany, were, not, as, strongly, anti, art, as, other, groups, their, activity, and, art, were, more, political, and, social, with, corrosive, manifestos, and, propaganda, satire, public, demonstrations, and, overt, political, activities, the, intensely, political, and, war, torn, environment, of, berlin, had, a, dramatic, impact, on, the, ideas, of, berlin, dadaists, conversely, new, york, s, geographic, distance, from, the, war, spawned, its, more, theoretically, driven, less, political, nature, according, to, hans, richter, a, dadaist, who, was, in, berlin, yet, aloof, from, active, participation, in, berlin, dada, several, distinguishing, characteristics, of, the, dada, movement, there, included, its, political, element, and, its, technical, discoveries, in, painting, and, literature, inexhaustible, energy, mental, freedom, which, included, the, abolition, of, everything, and, members, intoxicated, with, their, own, power, in, a, way, that, had, no, relation, to, the, real, world, who, would, turn, their, rebelliousness, even, against, each, other, in, february, 1918, while, the, great, war, was, approaching, its, climax, huelsenbeck, gave, his, first, dada, speech, in, berlin, and, he, produced, a, dada, manifesto, later, in, the, year, following, the, october, revolution, in, russia, by, then, out, of, the, war, hannah, h, ch, and, george, grosz, used, dada, to, express, communist, sympathies, grosz, together, with, john, heartfield, h, ch, and, hausmann, developed, the, technique, of, photomontage, during, this, period, johannes, baader, the, uninhibited, oberdada, was, the, crowbar, of, the, berlin, movement, s, direct, action, according, to, hans, richter, and, is, credited, with, creating, the, first, giant, collages, according, to, raoul, hausmann, after, the, war, the, artists, published, a, series, of, short, lived, political, magazines, and, held, the, first, international, dada, fair, the, greatest, project, yet, conceived, by, the, berlin, dadaists, in, the, summer, of, 1920, as, well, as, work, by, the, main, members, of, berlin, dada, grosz, raoul, hausmann, hannah, h, ch, johannes, baader, huelsenbeck, and, heartfield, the, exhibition, also, included, the, work, of, otto, dix, francis, picabia, jean, arp, max, ernst, rudolf, schlichter, johannes, baargeld, and, others, in, all, over, 200, works, were, exhibited, surrounded, by, incendiary, slogans, some, of, which, also, ended, up, written, on, the, walls, of, the, nazi, s, entartete, kunst, exhibition, in, 1937, despite, high, ticket, prices, the, exhibition, lost, money, with, only, one, recorded, sale, the, berlin, group, published, periodicals, such, as, club, dada, der, dada, everyman, his, own, football, and, dada, almanach, they, also, established, a, political, party, the, central, council, of, dada, for, the, world, revolution, in, cologne, ernst, baargeld, and, arp, launched, a, controversial, dada, exhibition, in, 1920, which, focused, on, nonsense, and, anti, bourgeois, sentiments, cologne, s, early, spring, exhibition, was, set, up, in, a, pub, and, required, that, participants, walk, past, urinals, while, being, read, lewd, poetry, by, a, woman, in, a, communion, dress, the, police,

arensberg, the, new, yorkers, though, not, particularly, organized, called, their, activities, dada, but, they, did, not, issue, manifestos, they, issued, challenges, to, art, and, culture, through, publications, such, as, the, blind, man, rongwrong, and, new, york, dada, in, which, they, criticized, the, traditionalist, basis, for, museum, art, new, york, dada, lacked, the, disillusionment, of, european, dada, and, was, instead, driven, by, a, sense, of, irony, and, humor, in, his, book, adventures, in, the, arts, informal, chapters, on, painters, vaudeville, and, poets, marsden, hartley, included, an, essay, on, the, importance, of, being, dada, during, this, time, duchamp, began, exhibiting, readymades, everyday, objects, found, or, purchased, and, declared, art, such, as, a, bottle, rack, and, was, active, in, the, society, of, independent, artists, in, 1917, he, submitted, the, now, famous, fountain, a, urinal, signed, r, mutt, to, the, society, of, independent, artists, exhibition, but, they, rejected, the, piece, first, an, object, of, scorn, within, the, arts, community, the, fountain, has, since, become, almost, canonized, by, some, as, one, of, the, most, recognizable, modernist, works, of, sculpture, art, world, experts, polled, by, the, sponsors, of, the, 2004, turner, prize, gordon, s, gin, voted, it, the, most, influential, work, of, modern, art, as, recent, scholarship, documents, the, work, is, still, controversial, duchamp, indicated, in, a, 1917, letter, to, his, sister, that, a, female, friend, was, centrally, involved, in, the, conception, of, this, work, one, of, my, female, friends, who, had, adopted, the, pseudonym, richard, mutt, sent, me, a, porcelain, urinal, as, a, sculpture, the, piece, is, in, line, with, the, scatological, aesthetics, of, duchamp, s, neighbour, the, baroness, elsa, von, freytag, loringhoven, in, an, attempt, to, pay, homage, to, the, spirit, of, dada, a, performance, artist, named, pierre,

1921, most, of, the, original, players, moved, to, paris, where, dada, had, experienced, its, last, major, incarnation, the, french, avant, garde, kept, abreast, of, dada, activities, in, z, rich, with, regular, communications, from, tristan, tzara, whose, pseudonym, means, sad, in, country, a, name, chosen, to, protest, the, treatment, of, jews, in, his, native, romania, who, exchanged,

classical, music, capital, of, the, world, since, the, advent, of, musical, impressionism, in, the, late, 19th, century, one, of, its, practitioners, erik, satie, collaborated, with, picasso, and, cocteau, in, a, mad, scandalous, ballet, called, parade, first, performed, by, the, ballets, russes, in, 1917, it, succeeded, in, creating, a, scandal, but, in, a, different, way, than, stravinsky, s, le, sacre, du, printemps, had, done, almost, five, years, earlier, this, was, a, ballet, that, was, clearly, parodying, itself, something, traditional, ballet, patrons, would, obviously, have, serious, issues, with, dada, in, paris, surged, in, 1920, when, many, of, the, originators, converged, there, inspired, by, tzara, paris, dada, soon, issued, manifestos, organized, demonstrations, staged, performances, and, produced, a, number, of, journals, the, final, two, editions, of, dada, le, cannibale, and, litt, rature, featured, dada, in, several, editions, the, first, introduction, of, dada, artwork, to, the, parisian, public, was, at, the, salon, des, ind, pendants, in, 1921, jean, crotti, exhibited, works, associated, with, dada, including, a, work, entitled, explicatif, bearing, the, word, tabu, in, the, same, year, tzara, staged, his, dadaist, play, the, gas, heart, to, howls, of, derision, from, the, audience, when, it, was, re, staged, in, 1923, in, a, more, professional, production, the, play, provoked, a, theatre, riot, initiated, by, andr, breton, that, heralded, the, split, within, the, movement, that, was, to, produce, surrealism, tzara, s, last, attempt, at, a, dadaist, drama, was, his, ironic, tragedy, handkerchief, of, clouds, in, 1924, in, the, netherlands, the, dada, movement, centered, mainly, around, theo, van, doesburg, best, known, for, establishing, the, de, stijl, movement, and, magazine, of, the, same, name, van, doesburg, mainly, focused, on, poetry, and, included, poems, from, many, well, known, dada, writers, in, de, stijl, such, as, hugo, ball, hans, arp, and, kurt, schwitters, van, doesburg, and, thijs, rinsema, a, cordwainer, and, artist, in, drachten, became, friends, of, schwitters, and, together, they, organized, the, so, called, dutch, dada, campaign, in, 1923, where, van, doesburg, promoted, a, leaflet, about, dada, entitled, what, is, dada, schwitters, read, his, poems, vilmos, husz, r, demonstrated, a, mechanical, dancing, doll, and, nelly, van, doesburg, theo, s, wife, played, avant, garde, compositions, on, piano, van, doesburg, wrote, dada, poetry, himself, in, de, stijl,
