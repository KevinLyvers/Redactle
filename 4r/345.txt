plucked, the, trumpet, is, a, brass, instrument, commonly, used, in, classical, and, jazz, ensembles, the, trumpet, group, ranges, from, the, piccolo, trumpet, with, the, highest, register, in, the, brass, family, to, the, bass, trumpet, pitched, one, octave, below, the, standard, b, or, c, trumpet, trumpet, like, instruments, have, historically, been, used, as, signaling, devices, in, battle, or, hunting, with, examples, dating, back, to, at, least, 2000, bc, they, began, to, be, used, as, musical, instruments, only, in, the, late, 14th, or, early, 15th, century, trumpets, are, used, in, art, music, styles, for, instance, in, orchestras, concert, bands, and, jazz, ensembles, as, well, as, in, popular, music, sound, is, produced, by, vibrating, the, lips, in, a, mouthpiece, which, starts, a, standing, wave, in, the, air, column, of, the, instrument, since, the, late, 15th, century, trumpets, have, primarily, been, constructed, of, brass, tubing, usually, bent, twice, into, a, rounded, rectangular, shape, there, are, many, distinct, types, of, trumpet, with, the, most, common, being, pitched, in, b, a, transposing, instrument, having, a, tubing, length, of, about, 1, 48, m, 4, ft, 10, in, early, trumpets, did, not, provide, means, to, change, the, length, of, tubing, whereas, modern, instruments, generally, have, three, or, sometimes, four, valves, in, order, to, change, their, pitch, most, trumpets, have, valves, of, the, piston, type, while, some, have, the, rotary, type, the, use, of, rotary, valved, trumpets, is, more, common, in, orchestral, settings, especially, in, german, and, german, style, orchestras, although, this, practice, varies, by, country, a, musician, who, plays, the, trumpet, is, called, a, trumpet, player, or, trumpeter, the, english, word, trumpet, was, first, used, in, the, late, 14th, century, the, word, came, from, old, french, trompette, which, is, a, diminutive, of, trompe, the, word, trump, meaning, trumpet, was, first, used, in, english, in, 1300, the, word, comes, from, old, french, trompe, long, tube, like, musical, wind, instrument, 12c, cognate, with, proven, al, tromba, italian, tromba, all, probably, from, a, germanic, source, compare, old, high, german, trumpa, old, norse, trumba, trumpet, of, imitative, origin, the, earliest, trumpets, date, back, to, 2000, bc, and, earlier, the, bronze, and, silver, tutankhamun, s, trumpets, from, his, grave, in, egypt, bronze, lurs, from, scandinavia, and, metal, trumpets, from, china, date, back, to, this, period, trumpets, from, the, oxus, civilization, 3rd, millennium, bc, of, central, asia, have, decorated, swellings, in, the, middle, yet, are, made, out, of, one, sheet, of, metal, which, is, considered, a, technical, wonder, for, its, time, the, salpinx, was, a, straight, trumpet, 62, inches, 1, 600, mm, long, made, of, bone, or, bronze, homer, s, iliad, 9th, or, 8th, century, bce, contain, the, earliest, reference, to, its, sound, and, further, frequent, descriptions, are, found, throughout, the, classical, period, salpinx, contests, were, a, part, of, the, original, olympic, games, the, shofar, made, from, a, ram, horn, and, the, hatzotzeroth, made, of, metal, are, both, mentioned, in, the, bible, they, were, said, to, have, been, played, in, solomon, s, temple, around, 3, 000, years, ago, they, are, still, used, on, certain, religious, days, the, moche, people, of, ancient, peru, depicted, trumpets, in, their, art, going, back, to, ad, 300, the, earliest, trumpets, were, signaling, instruments, used, for, military, or, religious, purposes, rather, than, music, in, the, modern, sense, and, the, modern, bugle, continues, this, signaling, tradition, improvements, to, instrument, design, and, metal, making, in, the, late, middle, ages, and, renaissance, led, to, an, increased, usefulness, of, the, trumpet, as, a, musical, instrument, the, natural, trumpets, of, this, era, consisted, of, a, single, coiled, tube, without, valves, and, therefore, could, only, produce, the, notes, of, a, single, overtone, series, changing, keys, required, the, player, to, change, crooks, of, the, instrument, the, development, of, the, upper, clarino, register, by, specialist, trumpeters, notably, cesare, bendinelli, would, lend, itself, well, to, the, baroque, era, also, known, as, the, golden, age, of, the, natural, trumpet, during, this, period, a, vast, body, of, music, was, written, for, virtuoso, trumpeters, the, art, was, revived, in, the, mid, 20th, century, and, natural, trumpet, playing, is, again, a, thriving, art, around, the, world, many, modern, players, in, germany, and, the, uk, who, perform, baroque, music, use, a, version, of, the, natural, trumpet, fitted, with, three, or, four, vent, holes, to, aid, in, correcting, out, of, tune, notes, in, the, harmonic, series, the, melody, dominated, homophony, of, the, classical, and, romantic, periods, relegated, the, trumpet, to, a, secondary, role, by, most, major, composers, owing, to, the, limitations, of, the, natural, trumpet, berlioz, wrote, in, 1844, notwithstanding, the, real, loftiness, and, distinguished, nature, of, its, quality, of, tone, there, are, few, instruments, that, have, been, more, degraded, than, the, trumpet, down, to, beethoven, and, weber, every, composer, not, excepting, mozart, persisted, in, confining, it, to, the, unworthy, function, of, filling, up, or, in, causing, it, to, sound, two, or, three, commonplace, rhythmical, formulae, the, trumpet, is, constructed, of, brass, tubing, bent, twice, into, a, rounded, oblong, shape, as, with, all, brass, instruments, sound, is, produced, by, blowing, air, through, slightly, separated, lips, producing, a, buzzing, sound, into, the, mouthpiece, and, starting, a, standing, wave, vibration, in, the, air, column, inside, the, trumpet, the, player, can, select, the, pitch, from, a, range, of, overtones, or, harmonics, by, changing, the, lip, aperture, and, tension, known, as, the, embouchure, the, mouthpiece, has, a, circular, rim, which, provides, a, comfortable, environment, for, the, lips, vibration, directly, behind, the, rim, is, the, cup, which, channels, the, air, into, a, much, smaller, opening, the, back, bore, or, shank, that, tapers, out, slightly, to, match, the, diameter, of, the, trumpet, s, lead, pipe, the, dimensions, of, these, parts, of, the, mouthpiece, affect, the, timbre, or, quality, of, sound, the, ease, of, playability, and, player, comfort, generally, the, wider, and, deeper, the, cup, the, darker, the, sound, and, timbre, modern, trumpets, have, three, or, infrequently, four, piston, valves, each, of, which, increases, the, length, of, tubing, when, engaged, thereby, lowering, the, pitch, the, first, valve, lowers, the, instrument, s, pitch, by, a, whole, step, two, semitones, the, second, valve, by, a, half, step, one, semitone, and, the, third, valve, by, one, and, a, half, steps, three, semitones, having, three, valves, provides, eight, possible, valve, combinations, including, none, but, only, seven, different, tubing, lengths, because, the, third, valve, alone, gives, essentially, the, same, tubing, length, as, the, 1, 2, combination, in, practice, there, is, often, a, deliberately, designed, slight, difference, between, 1, 2, and, 3, and, in, that, case, trumpet, players, will, select, the, alternative, that, gives, the, best, tuning, for, the, particular, note, being, played, when, a, fourth, valve, is, present, as, with, some, piccolo, trumpets, it, usually, lowers, the, pitch, a, perfect, fourth, five, semitones, used, singly, and, in, combination, these, valves, make, the, instrument, fully, chromatic, i, e, able, to, play, all, twelve, pitches, of, classical, music, for, more, information, about, the, different, types, of, valves, see, brass, instrument, valves, the, overall, pitch, of, the, trumpet, can, be, raised, or, lowered, by, the, use, of, the, tuning, slide, pulling, the, slide, out, lowers, the, pitch, pushing, the, slide, in, raises, it, pitch, can, be, bent, using, the, embouchure, only, to, overcome, the, problems, of, intonation, and, reduce, the, use, of, the, slides, renold, schilke, designed, the, tuning, bell, trumpet, removing, the, usual, brace, between, the, bell, and, a, valve, body, allows, the, use, of, a, sliding, bell, the, player, may, then, tune, the, horn, with, the, bell, while, leaving, the, slide, pushed, in, or, nearly, so, thereby, improving, intonation, and, overall, response, a, trumpet, becomes, a, closed, tube, when, the, player, presses, it, to, the, lips, therefore, the, instrument, only, naturally, produces, every, other, overtone, of, the, harmonic, series, the, shape, of, the, bell, makes, the, missing, overtones, audible, most, notes, in, the, series, are, slightly, out, of, tune, and, modern, trumpets, have, slide, mechanisms, for, the, first, and, third, valves, with, which, the, player, can, compensate, by, throwing, extending, or, retracting, one, or, both, slides, using, the, left, thumb, and, ring, finger, for, the, first, and, third, valve, slides, respectively, trumpets, can, be, constructed, from, other, materials, including, plastic, the, most, common, type, is, the, b, trumpet, but, a, c, d, e, e, low, f, and, g, trumpets, are, also, available, the, c, trumpet, is, most, common, in, american, orchestral, playing, where, it, is, used, alongside, the, b, trumpet, orchestral, trumpet, players, are, adept, at, transposing, music, at, sight, frequently, playing, music, written, for, the, a, b, d, e, e, or, f, trumpet, on, the, c, trumpet, or, b, trumpet, the, smallest, trumpets, are, referred, to, as, piccolo, trumpets, the, most, common, models, are, built, to, play, in, both, b, and, a, with, separate, leadpipes, for, each, key, the, tubing, in, the, b, piccolo, trumpet, is, one, half, the, length, of, that, in, a, standard, b, trumpet, making, it, sound, an, octave, higher, piccolo, trumpets, in, g, f, and, c, are, also, manufactured, but, are, less, common, almost, all, piccolo, trumpets, have, four, valves, instead, of, three, the, fourth, valve, usually, lowers, the, pitch, by, a, fourth, making, some, lower, notes, accessible, and, creating, alternate, fingerings, for, certain, trills, maurice, andr, h, kan, hardenberger, david, mason, and, wynton, marsalis, are, some, well, known, trumpet, players, known, for, their, virtuosity, on, the, piccolo, trumpet, trumpets, pitched, in, the, key, of, low, g, are, also, called, sopranos, or, soprano, bugles, after, their, adaptation, from, military, bugles, traditionally, used, in, drum, and, bugle, corps, sopranos, employ, either, rotary, valves, or, piston, valves, the, bass, trumpet, is, at, the, same, pitch, as, a, trombone, and, is, usually, played, by, a, trombone, player, although, its, music, is, written, in, treble, clef, most, bass, trumpets, are, pitched, in, either, c, or, b, the, c, bass, trumpet, sounds, an, octave, lower, than, written, and, the, b, bass, sounds, a, major, ninth, b, lower, making, them, both, transposing, instruments, the, historical, slide, trumpet, was, probably, first, developed, in, the, late, 14th, century, for, use, in, alta, cappella, wind, bands, deriving, from, early, straight, trumpets, the, renaissance, slide, trumpet, was, essentially, a, natural, trumpet, with, a, sliding, leadpipe, this, single, slide, was, awkward, as, the, entire, instrument, moved, and, the, range, of, the, slide, was, probably, no, more, than, a, major, third, originals, were, probably, pitched, in, d, to, fit, with, shawms, in, d, and, g, probably, at, a, typical, pitch, standard, near, a, 466, hz, no, known, instruments, from, this, period, survive, so, the, details, and, even, the, existence, of, a, renaissance, slide, trumpet, is, a, matter, of, debate, among, scholars, while, there, is, documentation, written, and, artistic, of, its, existence, there, is, also, conjecture, that, its, slide, would, have, been, impractical, some, slide, trumpet, designs, saw, use, in, england, in, the, 18th, century, the, pocket, trumpet, is, a, compact, b, trumpet, the, bell, is, usually, smaller, than, a, standard, trumpet, bell, and, the, tubing, is, more, tightly, wound, to, reduce, the, instrument, size, without, reducing, the, total, tube, length, its, design, is, not, standardized, and, the, quality, of, various, models, varies, greatly, it, can, have, a, unique, warm, sound, and, voice, like, articulation, since, many, pocket, trumpet, models, suffer, from, poor, design, as, well, as, poor, manufacturing, the, intonation, tone, color, and, dynamic, range, of, such, instruments, are, severely, hindered, professional, standard, instruments, are, however, available, while, they, are, not, a, substitute, for, the, full, sized, instrument, they, can, be, useful, in, certain, contexts, the, jazz, musician, don, cherry, was, renowned, for, his, playing, of, the, pocket, instrument, the, tubing, of, the, bell, section, of, a, herald, trumpet, is, straight, making, it, long, enough, to, accommodate, a, hanging, banner, this, instrument, is, mostly, used, for, ceremonial, events, such, as, parades, and, fanfares, david, monette, designed, the, flumpet, in, 1989, for, jazz, musician, art, farmer, it, is, a, hybrid, of, a, trumpet, and, a, flugelhorn, pitched, in, b, and, using, three, piston, valves, other, variations, include, rotary, valve, or, german, trumpets, which, are, commonly, used, in, professional, german, and, austrian, orchestras, alto, and, baroque, trumpets, and, the, vienna, valve, trumpet, primarily, used, in, viennese, brass, ensembles, and, orchestras, such, as, the, vienna, philharmonic, and, mnozil, brass, the, trumpet, is, often, confused, with, its, close, relative, the, cornet, which, has, a, more, conical, tubing, shape, compared, to, the, trumpet, s, more, cylindrical, tube, this, along, with, additional, bends, in, the, cornet, s, tubing, gives, the, cornet, a, slightly, mellower, tone, but, the, instruments, are, otherwise, nearly, identical, they, have, the, same, length, of, tubing, and, therefore, the, same, pitch, so, music, written, for, one, of, them, is, playable, on, the, other, another, relative, the, flugelhorn, has, tubing, that, is, even, more, conical, than, that, of, the, cornet, and, an, even, mellower, tone, it, is, sometimes, supplied, with, a, fourth, valve, to, improve, the, intonation, of, some, lower, notes, on, any, modern, trumpet, cornet, or, flugelhorn, pressing, the, valves, indicated, by, the, numbers, below, produces, the, written, notes, shown, open, means, all, valves, up, 1, means, first, valve, 1, 2, means, first, and, second, valve, simultaneously, and, so, on, the, sounding, pitch, depends, on, the, transposition, of, the, instrument, engaging, the, fourth, valve, if, present, usually, drops, any, of, these, pitches, by, a, perfect, fourth, as, well, within, each, overtone, series, the, different, pitches, are, attained, by, changing, the, embouchure, standard, fingerings, above, high, c, are, the, same, as, for, the, notes, an, octave, below, c, is, 1, 2, d, is, 1, etc, each, overtone, series, on, the, trumpet, begins, with, the, first, overtone, the, fundamental, of, each, overtone, series, cannot, be, produced, except, as, a, pedal, tone, notes, in, parentheses, are, the, sixth, overtone, representing, a, pitch, with, a, frequency, of, seven, times, that, of, the, fundamental, while, this, pitch, is, close, to, the, note, shown, it, is, flat, relative, to, equal, temperament, and, use, of, those, fingerings, is, generally, avoided, the, fingering, schema, arises, from, the, length, of, each, valve, s, tubing, a, longer, tube, produces, a, lower, pitch, valve, 1, increases, the, tubing, length, enough, to, lower, the, pitch, by, one, whole, step, valve, 2, by, one, half, step, and, valve, 3, by, one, and, a, half, steps, this, scheme, and, the, nature, of, the, overtone, series, create, the, possibility, of, alternate, fingerings, for, certain, notes, for, example, third, space, c, can, be, produced, with, no, valves, engaged, standard, fingering, or, with, valves, 2, 3, also, any, note, produced, with, 1, 2, as, its, standard, fingering, can, also, be, produced, with, valve, 3, each, drops, the, pitch, by, 1, 1, 2, steps, alternate, fingerings, may, be, used, to, improve, facility, in, certain, passages, or, to, aid, in, intonation, extending, the, third, valve, slide, when, using, the, fingerings, 1, 3, or, 1, 2, 3, further, lowers, the, pitch, slightly, to, improve, intonation, some, of, the, partials, of, the, harmonic, series, that, a, modern, b, trumpet, can, play, for, each, combination, of, valves, pressed, are, in, tune, with, 12, tone, equal, temperament, and, some, are, not, various, types, of, mutes, can, be, placed, in, or, over, the, bell, which, decreases, volume, and, changes, timbre, of, all, brass, instruments, trumpets, have, the, widest, selection, of, mutes, common, mutes, include, the, straight, mute, cup, mute, harmon, mute, wah, wah, or, wow, wow, mute, among, other, names, plunger, bucket, mute, and, practice, mute, when, the, type, of, mute, is, not, specified, players, generally, use, a, straight, mute, the, most, common, type, jazz, commercial, and, show, band, musicians, often, use, a, wider, range, of, mutes, than, their, classical, counterparts, and, many, mutes, were, invented, for, jazz, orchestrators, mutes, can, be, made, of, many, materials, including, fiberglass, plastic, cardboard, metal, and, stone, lining, a, trade, name, of, the, humes, berg, company, they, are, often, held, in, place, with, cork, to, better, keep, the, mute, in, place, players, sometimes, dampen, the, cork, by, blowing, warm, moist, air, on, it, the, straight, mute, is, conical, and, constructed, of, either, metal, usually, aluminum, which, produces, a, bright, piercing, sound, or, another, material, which, produces, a, darker, stuffier, sound, the, cup, mute, is, shaped, like, a, straight, mute, with, an, additional, bell, facing, cup, at, the, end, and, produces, a, darker, tone, than, a, straight, mute, the, harmon, mute, is, made, of, metal, usually, aluminum, or, copper, and, consists, of, a, stem, inserted, into, a, large, chamber, the, stem, can, be, extended, or, removed, to, produce, different, timbres, and, waving, one, s, hand, in, front, of, the, mute, produces, a, wah, wah, sound, hence, the, mute, s, colloquial, name, using, standard, technique, the, lowest, note, is, the, written, f, below, middle, c, there, is, no, actual, limit, to, how, high, brass, instruments, can, play, but, fingering, charts, generally, go, up, to, the, high, c, two, octaves, above, middle, c, several, trumpeters, have, achieved, fame, for, their, proficiency, in, the, extreme, high, register, among, them, maynard, ferguson, cat, anderson, dizzy, gillespie, doc, severinsen, and, more, recently, wayne, bergeron, louis, dowdeswell, thomas, gansch, james, morrison, jon, faddis, and, arturo, sandoval, it, is, also, possible, to, produce, pedal, tones, below, the, low, f, which, is, a, device, occasionally, employed, in, the, contemporary, repertoire, for, the, instrument, contemporary, music, for, the, trumpet, makes, wide, uses, of, extended, trumpet, techniques, flutter, tonguing, the, trumpeter, rolls, the, tip, of, the, tongue, as, if, rolling, an, r, in, spanish, to, produce, a, growling, like, tone, this, technique, is, widely, employed, by, composers, like, berio, and, stockhausen, growling, simultaneously, playing, tone, and, using, the, back, of, the, tongue, to, vibrate, the, uvula, creating, a, distinct, sound, most, trumpet, players, will, use, a, plunger, with, this, technique, to, achieve, a, particular, sound, heard, in, a, lot, of, chicago, jazz, of, the, 1950s, double, tonguing, the, player, articulates, using, the, syllables, ta, ka, ta, ka, ta, ka, triple, tonguing, the, same, as, double, tonguing, but, with, the, syllables, ta, ta, ka, ta, ta, ka, ta, ta, ka, doodle, tongue, the, trumpeter, tongues, as, if, saying, the, word, doodle, this, is, a, very, faint, tonguing, similar, in, sound, to, a, valve, tremolo, glissando, trumpeters, can, slide, between, notes, by, depressing, the, valves, halfway, and, changing, the, lip, tension, modern, repertoire, makes, extensive, use, of, this, technique, vibrato, it, is, often, regulated, in, contemporary, repertoire, through, specific, notation, composers, can, call, for, everything, from, fast, slow, or, no, vibrato, to, actual, rhythmic, patterns, played, with, vibrato, pedal, tone, composers, have, written, notes, as, low, as, two, and, a, half, octaves, below, the, low, f, at, the, bottom, of, the, standard, range, extreme, low, pedals, are, produced, by, slipping, the, lower, lip, out, of, the, mouthpiece, claude, gordon, assigned, pedals, as, part, of, his, trumpet, practice, routines, that, were, a, systematic, expansion, on, his, lessons, with, herbert, l, clarke, the, technique, was, pioneered, by, bohumir, kryl, microtones, composers, such, as, scelsi, and, stockhausen, have, made, wide, use, of, the, trumpet, s, ability, to, play, microtonally, some, instruments, feature, a, fourth, valve, that, provides, a, quarter, tone, step, between, each, note, the, jazz, musician, ibrahim, maalouf, uses, such, a, trumpet, invented, by, his, father, to, make, it, possible, to, play, arab, maqams, valve, tremolo, many, notes, on, the, trumpet, can, be, played, in, several, different, valve, combinations, by, alternating, between, valve, combinations, on, the, same, note, a, tremolo, effect, can, be, created, berio, makes, extended, use, of, this, technique, in, his, sequenza, x, noises, by, hissing, clicking, or, breathing, through, the, instrument, the, trumpet, can, be, made, to, resonate, in, ways, that, do, not, sound, at, all, like, a, trumpet, noises, may, require, amplification, preparation, composers, have, called, for, trumpeters, to, play, under, water, or, with, certain, slides, removed, it, is, increasingly, common, for, composers, to, specify, all, sorts, of, preparations, for, trumpet, extreme, preparations, involve, alternate, constructions, such, as, double, bells, and, extra, valves, split, tone, trumpeters, can, produce, more, than, one, tone, simultaneously, by, vibrating, the, two, lips, at, different, speeds, the, interval, produced, is, usually, an, octave, or, a, fifth, lip, trill, or, shake, also, known, as, lip, slurs, by, rapidly, varying, air, speed, but, not, changing, the, depressed, valves, the, pitch, can, vary, quickly, between, adjacent, harmonic, partials, shakes, and, lip, trills, can, vary, in, speed, and, in, the, distance, between, the, partials, however, lip, trills, and, shakes, usually, involve, the, next, partial, up, from, the, written, note, multi, phonics, playing, a, note, and, humming, a, different, note, simultaneously, for, example, sustaining, a, middle, c, and, humming, a, major, 3rd, e, at, the, same, time, circular, breathing, a, technique, wind, players, use, to, produce, uninterrupted, tone, without, pauses, for, breaths, the, player, puffs, up, the, cheeks, storing, air, then, breathes, in, rapidly, through, the, nose, while, using, the, cheeks, to, continue, pushing, air, outwards, one, trumpet, method, is, jean, baptiste, arban, s, complete, conservatory, method, for, trumpet, cornet, other, well, known, method, books, include, technical, studies, by, herbert, l, clarke, grand, method, by, louis, saint, jacome, daily, drills, and, technical, studies, by, max, schlossberg, and, methods, by, ernest, s, williams, claude, gordon, charles, colin, james, stamp, and, louis, davidson, a, common, method, book, for, beginners, is, the, walter, beeler, s, method, for, the, cornet, and, there, have, been, several, instruction, books, written, by, virtuoso, allen, vizzutti, merri, franquin, wrote, a, complete, method, for, modern, trumpet, which, fell, into, obscurity, for, much, of, the, twentieth, century, until, public, endorsements, by, maurice, andr, revived, interest, in, this, work, in, early, jazz, louis, armstrong, was, well, known, for, his, virtuosity, and, his, improvisations, on, the, hot, five, and, hot, seven, recordings, and, his, switch, from, cornet, to, trumpet, is, often, cited, as, heralding, the, trumpet, s, dominance, over, the, cornet, in, jazz, dizzy, gillespie, was, a, gifted, improviser, with, an, extremely, high, but, musical, range, building, on, the, style, of, roy, eldridge, but, adding, new, layers, of, harmonic, complexity, gillespie, had, an, enormous, impact, on, virtually, every, subsequent, trumpeter, both, by, the, example, of, his, playing, and, as, a, mentor, to, younger, musicians, miles, davis, is, widely, considered, one, of, the, most, influential, musicians, of, the, 20th, century, his, style, was, distinctive, and, widely, imitated, davis, phrasing, and, sense, of, space, in, his, solos, have, been, models, for, generations, of, jazz, musicians, cat, anderson, was, a, trumpet, player, who, was, known, for, the, ability, to, play, extremely, high, with, an, even, more, extreme, volume, who, played, with, duke, ellington, s, big, band, maynard, ferguson, came, to, prominence,
