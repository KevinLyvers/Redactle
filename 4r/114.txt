enlightenment, poet, abraham, cowley, who, revived, the, form, in, england, with, his, publication, of, fifteen, pindarique, odes, in, 1656, though, this, title, derives, from, pindar, it, is, a, misunderstanding, of, the, pindaric, ode, on, cowley, s, part, in, fact, cowley, s, odes, are, very, different, from, the, strictly, formal, pindaric, ode, in, cowley, s, poetry, the, ode, follows,

the, word, in, its, strict, form, were, the, epithalamium, and, prothalamium, of, edmund, spenser, in, the, 17th, century, the, original, odes, in, english, were, by, abraham, cowley, these, were, iambic, but, had, irregular, line, length, patterns, and, rhyme, schemes, cowley, based, the, principle, of, his, pindariques, on, an, apparent, misunderstanding, of, pindar, s, metrical, practice, but, nonetheless, others, widely, imitated, his, style, with, notable, success, by, john, dryden, with, pindar, s, metre, being, better, understood, in, the, 18th, century, the, fashion, for, pindaric, odes, faded, though, there, are, notable, actual, pindaric, odes, by, thomas, gray, the, progress, of, poesy, and, the, bard, around, 1800, william, wordsworth, revived, cowley, s, pindaric,
