the, panchatantra, iast, pa, catantra, iso, pa, catantra, sanskrit, five, treatises, is, an, ancient, indian, collection, of, interrelated, animal, fables, in, sanskrit, verse, and, prose, arranged, within, a, frame, story, the, surviving, work, is, dated, to, about, 200, bce, but, the, fables, are, likely, much, more, ancient, the, text, s, author, is, unknown, but, it, has, been, attributed, to, vishnu, sharma, in, some, recensions, and, vasubhaga, in, others, both, of, which, may, be, fictitious, pen, names, it, is, likely, a, hindu, text, and, based, on, older, oral, traditions, with, animal, fables, that, are, as, old, as, we, are, able, to, imagine, it, is, certainly, the, most, frequently, translated, literary, product, of, india, and, these, stories, are, among, the, most, widely, known, in, the, world, it, goes, by, many, names, in, many, cultures, there, is, a, version, of, panchatantra, in, nearly, every, major, language, of, india, and, in, addition, there, are, 200, versions, of, the, text, in, more, than, 50, languages, around, the, world, one, version, reached, europe, in, the, 11th, century, to, quote, edgerton, 1924, before, 1600, it, existed, in, greek, latin, spanish, italian, german, english, old, slavonic, czech, and, perhaps, other, slavonic, languages, its, range, has, extended, from, java, to, iceland, it, has, been, worked, over, and, over, again, expanded, abstracted, turned, into, verse, retold, in, prose, translated, into, medieval, and, modern, vernaculars, and, retranslated, into, sanskrit, and, most, of, the, stories, contained, in, it, have, gone, down, into, the, folklore, of, the, story, loving, hindus, whence, they, reappear, in, the, collections, of, oral, tales, gathered, by, modern, students, of, folk, stories, the, earliest, known, translation, into, a, non, indian, language, is, in, middle, persian, pahlavi, 550, ce, by, burzoe, this, became, the, basis, for, a, syriac, translation, as, kalilag, and, damnag, and, a, translation, into, arabic, in, 750, ce, by, persian, scholar, abdullah, ibn, al, muqaffa, as, kal, lah, wa, dimnah, a, new, persian, version, by, rudaki, from, the, 9th, 10th, century, ce, became, known, as, kal, leh, o, demneh, rendered, in, prose, by, abu, l, ma, ali, nasrallah, monshi, in, 1143, ce, this, was, the, basis, of, kashefi, s, 15th, century, anv, r, i, suhayl, the, lights, of, canopus, which, in, turn, was, translated, into, humayun, namah, in, turkish, the, book, is, also, known, as, the, fables, of, bidpai, or, pilpai, in, various, european, languages, vidyapati, in, sanskrit, or, the, morall, philosophie, of, doni, english, 1570, most, european, versions, of, the, text, are, derivative, works, of, the, 12th, century, hebrew, version, of, panchatantra, by, rabbi, joel, in, germany, its, translation, in, 1480, by, anton, von, pforr, has, been, widely, read, several, versions, of, the, text, are, also, found, in, indonesia, where, it, is, titled, as, tantri, kamandaka, tantravakya, or, candapingala, and, consists, of, 360, fables, in, laos, a, version, is, called, nandaka, prakarana, while, in, thailand, it, has, been, referred, to, as, nang, tantrai, the, prelude, section, of, the, panchatantra, identifies, an, octogenarian, brahmin, named, vishnusharma, iast, vi, u, arman, as, its, author, he, is, stated, to, be, teaching, the, principles, of, good, government, to, three, princes, of, amarasakti, it, is, unclear, states, patrick, olivelle, a, professor, of, sanskrit, and, indian, religions, if, vishnusharma, was, a, real, person, or, himself, a, literary, invention, some, south, indian, recensions, of, the, text, as, well, as, southeast, asian, versions, of, panchatantra, attribute, the, text, to, vasubhaga, states, olivelle, based, on, the, content, and, mention, of, the, same, name, in, other, texts, dated, to, ancient, and, medieval, era, centuries, most, scholars, agree, that, vishnusharma, is, a, fictitious, name, olivelle, and, other, scholars, state, that, regardless, of, who, the, author, was, it, is, likely, the, author, was, a, hindu, and, not, a, buddhist, nor, jain, but, it, is, unlikely, that, the, author, was, a, devotee, of, hindu, god, vishnu, because, the, text, neither, expresses, any, sentiments, against, other, hindu, deities, such, as, shiva, indra, and, others, nor, does, it, avoid, invoking, them, with, reverence, various, locations, where, the, text, was, composed, have, been, proposed, but, this, has, been, controversial, some, of, the, proposed, locations, include, kashmir, southwestern, or, south, india, the, text, s, original, language, was, likely, sanskrit, though, the, text, is, now, known, as, panchatantra, the, title, found, in, old, manuscript, versions, varies, regionally, and, includes, names, such, as, tantrakhyayika, panchakhyanaka, panchakhyana, and, tantropakhyana, the, suffix, akhyayika, and, akhyanaka, mean, little, story, or, little, story, book, in, sanskrit, the, text, was, translated, into, pahlavi, in, 550, ce, which, forms, the, latest, limit, of, the, text, s, existence, the, earliest, limit, is, uncertain, it, quotes, identical, verses, from, arthasastra, which, is, broadly, accepted, to, have, been, completed, by, the, early, centuries, of, the, common, era, according, to, olivelle, the, current, scholarly, consensus, places, the, panchatantra, around, 300, ce, although, we, should, remind, ourselves, that, this, is, only, an, educated, guess, the, text, quotes, from, older, genre, of, indian, literature, and, legends, with, anthropomorphic, animals, are, found, in, more, ancient, texts, dated, to, the, early, centuries, of, the, 1st, millennium, bce, such, as, the, chapter, 4, 1, of, the, chandogya, upanishad, according, to, gillian, adams, panchatantra, may, be, a, product, of, the, vedic, period, but, its, age, cannot, be, ascertained, with, confidence, because, the, original, sanskrit, version, has, been, lost,

matters, of, war, and, peace, some, present, fables, that, demonstrate, how, different, characters, have, different, needs, and, motives, which, is, subjectively, rational, from, each, character, s, viewpoint, and, that, addressing, these, needs, can, empower, peaceful, relationships, even, if, they, start, off, in, a, different, way, for, example, in, the, fable, the, old, man, the, young, wife, the, text, relates, a, story, wherein, an, old, man, marries, a, young, woman, from, a, penniless, family, the, young, woman, detests, his, appearance, so, much, that, she, refuses, to, even, look,

air, the, book, five, is, also, unusual, in, that, almost, all, its, characters, are, humans, unlike, the, first, four, where, the, characters, are, predominantly, anthropomorphized, animals, according, to, olivelle, it, may, be, that, the, text, s, ancient, author, sought, to, bring, the, reader, out, of, the, fantasy, world, of, talking, and, pondering, animals, into, the, realities, of, the, human, world, the, fifth, book, contains, twelve, fables, about, hasty, actions, or, jumping, to, conclusions, without, establishing, facts, and, proper, due, diligence, in, ryder, translation,

woman, and, a, mongoose, she, leaves, her, child, with, a, mongoose, friend, when, she, returns, she, sees, blood, on, the, mongoose, s, mouth, and, kills, the, friend, believing, the, animal, killed, her, child, the, woman, discovers, her, child, alive, and, learns, that, the, blood, on, the, mongoose, mouth, came, from, it, biting, the, snake, while, defending, her, child, from, the, snake, s, attack, she, regrets, having, killed, the, friend, because, of, her, hasty, action, the, fables, of, panchatantra, are, found, in, numerous, world, languages, it, is, also, considered, partly, the, origin, of, european, secondary, works, such, as, folk, tale, motifs, found, in, boccaccio, la, fontaine, and, the, works, of, grimm, brothers, for, a, while, this, had, led, to, the, hypothesis, that, popular, worldwide, animal, based, fables, had, origins, in, india, and, the, middle, east, according, to, max, muller, sanskrit, literature, is, very, rich, in, fables, and, stories, no, other, literature, can, vie, with, it, in, that, respect, nay, it, is, extremely, likely, that, fables, in, particular, animal, fables, had, their, principal, source, in, india, this, monocausal, hypothesis, has, now, been, generally, discarded, in, favor, of, polygenetic, hypothesis, which, states, that, fable, motifs, had, independent, origins, in, many, ancient, human, cultures, some, of, which, have, common, roots, and, some, influenced, by, co, sharing, of, fables, the, shared, fables, implied, morals, that, appealed, to, communities, separated, by, large, distances, and, these, fables, were, therefore, retained, transmitted, over, human, generations, with, local, variations, however, many, post, medieval, era, authors, explicitly, credit, their, inspirations, to, texts, such, as, bidpai, and, pilpay, the, indian, sage, that, are, known, to, be, based, on, the, panchatantra, according, to, niklas, bengtsson, even, though, india, being, the, exclusive, original, source, of, animal, fables, is, no, longer, taken, seriously, the, ancient, classic, panchatantra, which, new, folklore, research, continues, to, illuminate, was, certainly, the, first, work, ever, written, down, for, children, and, this, in, itself, means, that, the, indian, influence, has, been, enormous, not, only, on, the, genres, of, fables, and, fairy, tales, but, on, those, genres, as, taken, up, in, children, s, literature, according, to, adams, and, bottigheimer, the, fables, of, panchatantra, are, known, in, at, least, 38, languages, around, the, world, in, 112, versions, by, jacob, s, old, estimate, and, its, relationship, with, mesopotamian, and, greek, fables, is, hotly, debated, in, part, because, the, original, manuscripts, of, all, three, ancient, texts, have, not, survived, olivelle, states, that, there, are, 200, versions, of, the, text, in, more, than, 50, languages, around, the, world, in, addition, to, a, version, in, nearly, every, major, language, of, india, scholars, have, noted, the, strong, similarity, between, a, few, of, the, stories, in, the, panchatantra, and, aesop, s, fables, examples, are, the, ass, in, the, panther, s, skin, and, the, ass, without, heart, and, ears, the, broken, pot, is, similar, to, aesop, s, the, milkmaid, and, her, pail, the, gold, giving, snake, is, similar, to, aesop, s, the, man, and, the, serpent, and, le, paysan, et, dame, serpent, by, marie, de, france, fables, other, well, known, stories, include, the, tortoise, and, the, geese, and, the, tiger, the, brahmin, and, the, jackal, similar, animal, fables, are, found, in, most, cultures, of, the, world, although, some, folklorists, view, india, as, the, prime, source, the, panchatantra, has, been, a, source, of, the, world, s, fable, literature, the, french, fabulist, jean, de, la, fontaine, acknowledged, his, indebtedness, to, the, work, in, the, introduction, to, his, second, fables, the, panchatantra, is, the, origin, also, of, several, stories, in, arabian, nights, sindbad, and, of, many, western, nursery, rhymes, and, ballads, in, the, indian, tradition, the, panchatantra, is, a, n, ti, stra, n, ti, can, be, roughly, translated, as, the, wise, conduct, of, life, and, a, stra, is, a, technical, or, scientific, treatise, thus, it, is, considered, a, treatise, on, political, science, and, human, conduct, its, literary, sources, are, the, expert, tradition, of, political, science, and, the, folk, and, literary, traditions, of, storytelling, it, draws, from, the, dharma, and, artha, stra, s, quoting, them, extensively, it, is, also, explained, that, n, ti, represents, an, admirable, attempt, to, answer, the, insistent, question, how, to, win, the, utmost, possible, joy, from, life, in, the, world, of, men, and, that, n, ti, is, the, harmonious, development, of, the, powers, of, man, a, life, in, which, security, prosperity, resolute, action, friendship, and, good, learning, are, so, combined, to, produce, joy, the, panchatantra, shares, many, stories, in, common, with, the, buddhist, jataka, tales, purportedly, told, by, the, historical, buddha, before, his, death, around, 400, bce, as, the, scholar, patrick, olivelle, writes, it, is, clear, that, the, buddhists, did, not, invent, the, stories, it, is, quite, uncertain, whether, the, author, of, borrowed, his, stories, from, the, j, taka, s, or, the, mah, bh, rata, or, whether, he, was, tapping, into, a, common, treasury, of, tales, both, oral, and, literary, of, ancient, india, many, scholars, believe, the, tales, were, based, on, earlier, oral, folk, traditions, which, were, finally, written, down, although, there, is, no, conclusive, evidence, in, the, early, 20th, century, w, norman, brown, found, that, many, folk, tales, in, india, appeared, to, be, borrowed, from, literary, sources, and, not, vice, versa, an, early, western, scholar, who, studied, the, panchatantra, was, dr, johannes, hertel, who, thought, the, book, had, a, machiavellian, character, similarly, edgerton, noted, that, the, so, called, morals, of, the, stories, have, no, bearing, on, morality, they, are, unmoral, and, often, immoral, they, glorify, shrewdness, and, practical, wisdom, in, the, affairs, of, life, and, especially, of, politics, of, government, other, scholars, dismiss, this, assessment, as, one, sided, and, view, the, stories, as, teaching, dharma, or, proper, moral, conduct, also, on, the, surface, the, pa, catantra, presents, stories, and, sayings, which, favor, the, outwitting, of, roguery, and, practical, intelligence, rather, than, virtue, however, from, this, viewpoint, the, tales, of, the, pa, catantra, are, eminently, ethical, the, prevailing, mood, promotes, an, earthy, moral, rational, and, unsentimental, ability, to, learn, from, repeated, experience, according, to, olivelle, indeed, the, current, scholarly, debate, regarding, the, intent, and, purpose, of, the, pa, catantra, whether, it, supports, unscrupulous, machiavellian, politics, or, demands, ethical, conduct, from, those, holding, high, office, underscores, the, rich, ambiguity, of, the, text, konrad, meisig, states, that, the, panchatantra, has, been, incorrectly, represented, by, some, as, an, entertaining, textbook, for, the, education, of, princes, in, the, machiavellian, rules, of, arthasastra, but, instead, it, is, a, book, for, the, little, man, to, develop, niti, social, ethics, prudent, behavior, shrewdness, in, their, pursuit, of, artha, and, a, work, on, social, satire, according, to, joseph, jacobs, if, one, thinks, of, it, the, very, raison, d, tre, of, the, fable, is, to, imply, its, moral, without, mentioning, it, the, panchatantra, states, patrick, olivelle, tells, wonderfully, a, collection, of, delightful, stories, with, pithy, proverbs, ageless, and, practical, wisdom, one, of, its, appeal, and, success, is, that, it, is, a, complex, book, that, does, not, reduce, the, complexities, of, human, life, government, policy, political, strategies, and, ethical, dilemmas, into, simple, solutions, it, can, and, does, speak, to, different, readers, at, different, levels, in, the, indian, tradition, the, work, is, a, shastra, genre, of, literature, more, specifically, a, nitishastra, text, the, text, has, been, a, source, of, studies, on, political, thought, in, hinduism, as, well, as, the, management, of, artha, with, a, debate, on, virtues, and, vices, the, sanskrit, version, of, the, panchatantra, text, gives, names, to, the, animal, characters, but, these, names, are, creative, with, double, meanings, the, names, connote, the, character, observable, in, nature, but, also, map, a, human, personality, that, a, reader, can, readily, identify, for, example, the, deer, characters, are, presented, as, a, metaphor, for, the, charming, innocent, peaceful, and, tranquil, personality, who, is, a, target, for, those, who, seek, a, prey, to, exploit, while, the, crocodile, is, presented, to, symbolize, dangerous, intent, hidden, beneath, a, welcoming, ambiance, waters, of, a, lotus, flower, laden, pond, dozens, of, different, types, of, wildlife, found, in, india, are, thus, named, and, they, constitute, an, array, of, symbolic, characters, in, the, panchatantra, thus, the, names, of, the, animals, evoke, layered, meaning, that, resonates, with, the, reader, and,

indian, version, was, first, translated, into, a, foreign, language, pahlavi, by, borz, ya, in, 570, ce, then, into, arabic, in, 750, this, arabic, version, was, translated, into, several, languages, including, syriac, greek, persian, hebrew, and, spanish, and, thus, became, the, source, of, versions, in, european, languages, until, the, english, translation, by, charles, wilkins, of, the, sanskrit, hitopadesha, in, 1787, the, panchatantra, approximated, its, current, literary, form, within, the, 4th, 6th, centuries, ce, though, originally, written, around, 200, bce, no, sanskrit,

persian, and, indian, royal, courts, and, he, secretly, translated, a, copy, of, the, text, then, sent, it, to, the, court, of, anoushiravan, in, persia, along, with, other, cultural, and, technical, knowledge, borzuy, s, translation, of, the, sanskrit, version, into, pahlavi, arrived, in, persia, by, the, 6th, century, but, this, middle, persian, version, is, now, lost, the, book, had, become, popular, in, sassanid, and, was, translated, into, syriac, and, arabic, whose, copies, survive, according, to, riedel, the, three, preserved, new, persian, translations, originated, between, the, 10th, and, 12th, century, and, are, based, on, the, 8th, century, arabic, translation, by, ibn, al, muqaffa, of, borzuy, s, work, on, panchatantra, it, is, the, 8th, century, kalila, wa, demna, text, states, riedel, that, has, been, the, most, influential, of, the, known, arabic, versions, not, only, in, the, middle, east, but, also, through, its, translations, into, greek, hebrew, and, old, spanish, the, persian, ibn, al, muqaffa, translated, the, panchatantra, in, middle, persian, kalilag, o, demnag, from, middle, persian, to, arabic, as, kal, la, wa, dimna, this, is, considered, the, first, masterpiece, of, arabic, literary, prose, the, introduction, of, the, first, book, of, kalila, wa, demna, is, different, from, panchatantra, in, being, more, elaborate, and, instead, of, king, and, his, three, sons, studying, in, the, indian, version, the, persian, version, speaks, of, a, merchant, and, his, three, sons, who, had, squandered, away, their, father, s, wealth, the, persian, version, also, makes, an, abrupt, switch, from, the, story, of, the, three, sons, to, an, injured, ox, and, thereafter, parallels, the, panchatantra, the, two, jackals, names, transmogrified, into, kalila, and, dimna, in, the, persian, version, perhaps, because, the, first, section, constituted, most, of, the, work, or, because, translators, could, find, no, simple, equivalent, in, zoroastrian, pahlavi, for, the, concept, expressed, by, the, sanskrit, word, panchatantra, the, jackals, names, kalila, and, dimna, became, the, generic, name, for, the, entire, work, in, classical, times, after, the, first, chapter, ibn, al, muqaffa, inserted, a, new, one, telling, of, dimna, s, trial, the, jackal, is, suspected, of, instigating, the, death, of, the, bull, shanzabeh, a, key, character, in,
