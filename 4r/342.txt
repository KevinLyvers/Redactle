a, brass, instrument, is, a, musical, instrument, that, produces, sound, by, sympathetic, vibration, of, air, in, a, tubular, resonator, in, sympathy, with, the, vibration, of, the, player, s, lips, brass, instruments, are, also, called, labrosones, or, labrophones, from, latin, and, greek, elements, meaning, lip, and, sound, there, are, several, factors, involved, in, producing, different, pitches, on, a, brass, instrument, slides, valves, crooks, though, they, are, rarely, used, today, or, keys, are, used, to, change, vibratory, length, of, tubing, thus, changing, the, available, harmonic, series, while, the, player, s, embouchure, lip, tension, and, air, flow, serve, to, select, the, specific, harmonic, produced, from, the, available, series, the, view, of, most, scholars, see, organology, is, that, the, term, brass, instrument, should, be, defined, by, the, way, the, sound, is, made, as, above, and, not, by, whether, the, instrument, is, actually, made, of, brass, thus, one, finds, brass, instruments, made, of, wood, like, the, alphorn, the, cornett, the, serpent, and, the, didgeridoo, while, some, woodwind, instruments, are, made, of, brass, like, the, saxophone, modern, brass, instruments, generally, come, in, one, of, two, families, plucked, there, are, two, other, families, that, have, in, general, become, functionally, obsolete, for, practical, purposes, instruments, of, both, types, however, are, sometimes, used, for, period, instrument, performances, of, baroque, or, classical, pieces, in, more, modern, compositions, they, are, occasionally, used, for, their, intonation, or, tone, color, brass, instruments, may, also, be, characterised, by, two, generalizations, about, geometry, of, the, bore, that, is, the, tubing, between, the, mouthpiece, and, the, flaring, of, the, tubing, into, the, bell, those, two, generalizations, are, with, regard, to, while, all, modern, valved, and, slide, brass, instruments, consist, in, part, of, conical, and, in, part, of, cylindrical, tubing, they, are, divided, as, follows, the, resonances, of, a, brass, instrument, resemble, a, harmonic, series, with, the, exception, of, the, lowest, resonance, which, is, significantly, lower, than, the, fundamental, frequency, of, the, series, that, the, other, resonances, are, overtones, of, depending, on, the, instrument, and, the, skill, of, the, player, the, missing, fundamental, of, the, series, can, still, be, played, as, a, pedal, tone, which, relies, mainly, on, vibration, at, the, overtone, frequencies, to, produce, the, fundamental, pitch, the, bore, diameter, in, relation, to, length, determines, whether, the, fundamental, tone, or, the, first, overtone, is, the, lowest, partial, practically, available, to, the, player, in, terms, of, playability, and, musicality, dividing, brass, instruments, into, whole, tube, and, half, tube, instruments, these, terms, stem, from, a, comparison, to, organ, pipes, which, produce, the, same, pitch, as, the, fundamental, pedal, tone, of, a, brass, instrument, of, equal, length, neither, the, horns, nor, the, trumpet, could, produce, the, 1st, note, of, the, harmonic, series, a, horn, giving, the, c, of, an, open, 8, ft, organ, pipe, had, to, be, 16, ft, 5, m, long, half, its, length, was, practically, useless, it, was, found, that, if, the, calibre, of, tube, was, sufficiently, enlarged, in, proportion, to, its, length, the, instrument, could, be, relied, upon, to, give, its, fundamental, note, in, all, normal, circumstances, cecil, forsyth, orchestration, p, 86, the, instruments, in, this, list, fall, for, various, reasons, outside, the, scope, of, much, of, the, discussion, above, regarding, families, of, brass, instruments, valves, are, used, to, change, the, length, of, tubing, of, a, brass, instrument, allowing, the, player, to, reach, the, notes, of, various, harmonic, series, each, valve, pressed, diverts, the, air, stream, through, additional, tubing, individually, or, in, conjunction, with, other, valves, this, lengthens, the, vibrating, air, column, thus, lowering, the, fundamental, tone, and, associated, harmonic, series, produced, by, the, instrument, designs, exist, although, rare, in, which, this, behaviour, is, reversed, i, e, pressing, a, valve, removes, a, length, of, tubing, rather, than, adding, one, one, modern, example, of, such, an, ascending, valve, is, the, yamaha, ysl, 350c, trombone, in, which, the, extra, valve, tubing, is, normally, engaged, to, pitch, the, instrument, in, b, and, pressing, the, thumb, lever, removes, a, whole, step, to, pitch, the, instrument, in, c, valves, require, regular, lubrication, a, core, standard, valve, layout, based, on, the, action, of, three, valves, had, become, almost, universal, by, at, latest, 1864, as, witnessed, by, arban, s, method, published, in, that, year, the, effect, of, a, particular, combination, of, valves, may, be, seen, in, the, table, below, this, table, is, correct, for, the, core, three, valve, layout, on, almost, any, modern, valved, brass, instrument, the, most, common, four, valve, layout, is, a, superset, of, the, well, established, three, valve, layout, and, is, noted, in, the, table, despite, the, exposition, of, four, valve, and, also, five, valve, systems, the, latter, used, on, the, tuba, being, incomplete, in, this, article, since, valves, lower, the, pitch, a, valve, that, makes, a, pitch, too, low, flat, creates, an, interval, wider, than, desired, while, a, valve, that, plays, sharp, creates, an, interval, narrower, than, desired, intonation, deficiencies, of, brass, instruments, that, are, independent, of, the, tuning, or, temperament, system, are, inherent, in, the, physics, of, the, most, popular, valve, design, which, uses, a, small, number, of, valves, in, combination, to, avoid, redundant, and, heavy, lengths, of, tubing, this, is, entirely, separate, from, the, slight, deficiencies, between, western, music, s, dominant, equal, even, temperament, system, and, the, just, not, equal, temperament, of, the, harmonic, series, itself, since, each, lengthening, of, the, tubing, has, an, inversely, proportional, effect, on, pitch, pitch, of, brass, instruments, while, pitch, perception, is, logarithmic, there, is, no, way, for, a, simple, uncompensated, addition, of, length, to, be, correct, in, every, combination, when, compared, with, the, pitches, of, the, open, tubing, and, the, other, valves, for, example, given, a, length, of, tubing, equaling, 100, units, of, length, when, open, one, may, obtain, the, following, tuning, discrepancies, playing, notes, using, valves, notably, 1st, 3rd, and, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, requires, compensation, to, adjust, the, tuning, appropriately, either, by, the, player, s, lip, and, breath, control, via, mechanical, assistance, of, some, sort, or, in, the, case, of, horns, by, the, position, of, the, stopping, hand, in, the, bell, t, stands, for, trigger, on, a, trombone, traditionally, the, valves, lower, the, pitch, of, the, instrument, by, adding, extra, lengths, of, tubing, based, on, a, just, tuning, combining, the, valves, and, the, harmonics, of, the, instrument, leads, to, the, following, ratios, and, comparisons, to, 12, tone, equal, tuning, and, to, a, common, five, limit, tuning, in, c, the, additional, tubing, for, each, valve, usually, features, a, short, tuning, slide, of, its, own, for, fine, adjustment, of, the, valve, s, tuning, except, when, it, is, too, short, to, make, this, practicable, for, the, first, and, third, valves, this, is, often, designed, to, be, adjusted, as, the, instrument, is, played, to, account, for, the, deficiencies, in, the, valve, system, in, most, trumpets, and, cornets, the, compensation, must, be, provided, by, extending, the, third, valve, slide, with, the, third, or, fourth, finger, and, the, first, valve, slide, with, the, left, hand, thumb, see, trigger, or, throw, below, this, is, used, to, lower, the, pitch, of, the, 1, 3, and, 1, 2, 3, valve, combinations, on, the, trumpet, and, cornet, these, valve, combinations, correspond, to, low, d, low, c, low, g, and, low, f, so, chromatically, to, stay, in, tune, one, must, use, this, method, in, instruments, with, a, fourth, valve, such, as, tubas, euphoniums, piccolo, trumpets, etc, that, valve, lowers, the, pitch, by, a, perfect, fourth, this, is, used, to, compensate, for, the, sharpness, of, the, valve, combinations, 1, 3, and, 1, 2, 3, 4, replaces, 1, 3, 2, 4, replaces, 1, 2, 3, all, three, normal, valves, may, be, used, in, addition, to, the, fourth, to, increase, the, instrument, s, range, downwards, by, a, perfect, fourth, although, with, increasingly, severe, intonation, problems, when, four, valved, models, without, any, kind, of, compensation, play, in, the, corresponding, register, the, sharpness, becomes, so, severe, that, players, must, finger, the, note, a, half, step, below, the, one, they, are, trying, to, play, this, eliminates, the, note, a, half, step, above, their, open, fundamental, manufacturers, of, low, brass, instruments, may, choose, one, or, a, combination, of, four, basic, approaches, to, compensate, for, the, tuning, difficulties, whose, respective, merits, are, subject, to, debate, in, the, compensation, system, each, of, the, first, two, or, three, valves, has, an, additional, set, of, tubing, extending, from, the, back, of, the, valve, when, the, third, or, fourth, valve, is, depressed, in, combination, with, another, one, the, air, is, routed, through, both, the, usual, set, of, tubing, plus, the, extra, one, so, that, the, pitch, is, lowered, by, an, appropriate, amount, this, allows, compensating, instruments, to, play, with, accurate, intonation, in, the, octave, below, their, open, second, partial, which, is, critical, for, tubas, and, euphoniums, in, much, of, their, repertoire, the, compensating, system, was, applied, to, horns, to, serve, a, different, purpose, it, was, used, to, allow, a, double, horn, in, f, and, b, to, ease, playing, difficulties, in, the, high, register, in, contrast, to, the, system, in, use, in, tubas, and, euphoniums, the, default, side, of, the, horn, is, the, longer, f, horn, with, secondary, lengths, of, tubing, coming, into, play, when, the, first, second, or, third, valves, are, pressed, pressing, the, thumb, valve, takes, these, secondary, valve, slides, and, the, extra, length, of, main, tubing, out, of, play, to, produce, a, shorter, b, horn, a, later, full, double, design, has, completely, separate, valve, section, tubing, for, the, two, sides, and, is, considered, superior, although, rather, heavier, in, weight, initially, compensated, instruments, tended, to, sound, stuffy, and, blow, less, freely, due, to, the, air, being, doubled, back, through, the, main, valves, in, early, designs, this, led, to, sharp, bends, in, the, tubing, and, other, obstructions, of, the, air, flow, some, manufacturers, therefore, preferred, adding, more, straight, valves, instead, which, for, example, could, be, pitched, a, little, lower, than, the, 2nd, and, 1st, valves, and, were, intended, to, be, used, instead, of, these, in, the, respective, valve, combinations, while, no, longer, featured, in, euphoniums, for, decades, many, professional, tubas, are, still, built, like, this, with, five, valves, being, common, on, cc, and, bb, tubas, and, five, or, six, valves, on, f, tubas, compensating, double, horns, can, also, suffer, from, the, stuffiness, resulting, from, the, air, being, passed, through, the, valve, section, twice, but, as, this, really, only, affects, the, longer, f, side, a, compensating, double, can, be, very, useful, for, a, 1st, or, 3rd, horn, player, who, uses, the, f, side, less, another, approach, was, the, addition, of, two, sets, of, slides, for, different, parts, of, the, range, some, euphoniums, and, tubas, were, built, like, this, but, today, this, approach, has, become, highly, exotic, for, all, instruments, except, horns, where, it, is, the, norm, usually, in, a, double, sometimes, even, triple, configuration, some, valved, brass, instruments, provide, triggers, or, throws, that, manually, lengthen, or, less, commonly, shorten, the, main, tuning, slide, a, valve, slide, or, the, main, tubing, these, mechanisms, alter, the, pitch, of, notes, that, are, naturally, sharp, in, a, specific, register, of, the, instrument, or, shift, the, instrument, to, another, playing, range, triggers, and, throws, permit, speedy, adjustment, while, playing, trigger, is, used, in, two, senses, a, throw, is, a, simple, metal, grip, for, the, player, s, finger, or, thumb, attached, to, a, valve, slide, the, general, term, throw, can, describe, a, u, hook, a, saddle, u, shaped, grips, or, a, ring, ring, shape, grip, in, which, a, player, s, finger, or, thumb, rests, a, player, extends, a, finger, or, thumb, to, lengthen, a, slide, and, retracts, the, finger, to, return, the, slide, to, its, original, position, triggers, or, throws, are, sometimes, found, on, the, first, valve, slide, they, are, operated, by, the, player, s, thumb, and, are, used, to, adjust, a, large, range, of, notes, using, the, first, valve, most, notably, the, player, s, written, top, line, f, the, a, above, directly, above, that, and, the, b, above, that, other, notes, that, require, the, first, valve, slide, but, are, not, as, problematic, without, it, include, the, first, line, e, the, f, above, that, the, a, above, that, and, the, third, line, b, triggers, or, throws, are, often, found, on, the, third, valve, slide, they, are, operated, by, the, player, s, fourth, finger, and, are, used, to, adjust, the, lower, d, and, c, trumpets, typically, use, throws, whilst, cornets, may, have, a, throw, or, trigger, trombone, triggers, are, primarily, but, not, exclusively, installed, on, the, f, trigger, bass, and, contrabass, trombones, to, alter, the, length, of, tubing, thus, making, certain, ranges, and, pitches, more, accessible, a, euphonium, occasionally, has, a, trigger, on, valves, other, than, 2, especially, 3, although, many, professional, quality, euphoniums, and, indeed, other, brass, band, instruments, have, a, trigger, for, the, main, tuning, slide, the, two, major, types, of, valve, mechanisms, are, rotary, valves, and, piston, valves, the, first, piston, valve, instruments, were, developed, just, after, the, start, of, the, 19th, century, the, st, lzel, valve, invented, by, heinrich, st, lzel, in, 1814, was, an, early, variety, in, the, mid, 19th, century, the, vienna, valve, was, an, improved, design, however, many, professional, musicians, preferred, rotary, valves, for, quicker, more, reliable, action, until, better, designs, of, piston, valves, were, mass, manufactured, towards, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, since, the, early, decades, of, the, 20th, century, piston, valves, have, been, the, most, common, on, brass, instruments, except, for, the, orchestral, horn, and, the, tuba, see, also, the, article, brass, instrument, valves, because, the, player, of, a, brass, instrument, has, direct, control, of, the, prime, vibrator, the, lips, brass, instruments, exploit, the, player, s, ability, to, select, the, harmonic, at, which, the, instrument, s, column, of, air, vibrates, by, making, the, instrument, about, twice, as, long, as, the, equivalent, woodwind, instrument, and, starting, with, the, second, harmonic, players, can, get, a, good, range, of, notes, simply, by, varying, the, tension, of, their, lips, see, embouchure, most, brass, instruments, are, fitted, with, a, removable, mouthpiece, different, shapes, sizes, and, styles, of, mouthpiece, may, be, used, to, suit, different, embouchures, or, to, more, easily, produce, certain, tonal, characteristics, trumpets, trombones, and, tubas, are, characteristically, fitted, with, a, cupped, mouthpiece, while, horns, are, fitted, with, a, conical, mouthpiece, one, interesting, difference, between, a, woodwind, instrument, and, a, brass, instrument, is, that, woodwind, instruments, are, non, directional, this, means, that, the, sound, produced, propagates, in, all, directions, with, approximately, equal, volume, brass, instruments, on, the, other, hand, are, highly, directional, with, most, of, the, sound, produced, traveling, straight, outward, from, the, bell, this, difference, makes, it, significantly, more, difficult, to, record, a, brass, instrument, accurately, it, also, plays, a, major, role, in, some, performance, situations, such, as, in, marching, bands, traditionally, the, instruments, are, normally, made, of, brass, polished, and, then, lacquered, to, prevent, corrosion, some, higher, quality, and, higher, cost, instruments, use, gold, or, silver, plating, to, prevent, corrosion, alternatives, to, brass, include, other, alloys, containing, significant, amounts, of, copper, or, silver, these, alloys, are, biostatic, due, to, the, oligodynamic, effect, and, thus, suppress, growth, of, molds, fungi, or, bacteria, brass, instruments, constructed, from, stainless, steel, or, aluminium, have, good, sound, quality, but, are, rapidly, colonized, by, microorganisms, and, become, unpleasant, to, play, most, higher, quality, instruments, are, designed, to, prevent, or, reduce, galvanic, corrosion, between, any, steel, in, the, valves, and, springs, and, the, brass, of, the, tubing, this, may, take, the, form, of, desiccant, design, to, keep, the, valves, dry, sacrificial, zincs, replaceable, valve, cores, and, springs, plastic, insulating, washers, or, nonconductive, or, noble, materials, for, the, valve, cores, and, springs, some, instruments, use, several, such, features, the, process, of, making, the, large, open, end, bell, of, a, brass, instrument, is, called, metal, beating, in, making, the, bell, of, for, example, a, trumpet, a, person, lays, out, a, pattern, and, shapes, sheet, metal, into, a, bell, shape, using, templates, machine, tools, handtools, and, blueprints, the, maker, cuts, out, the, bell, blank, using, hand, or, power, shears, he, hammers, the, blank, over, a, bell, shaped, mandrel, and, butts, the, seam, using, a, notching, tool, the, seam, is, brazed, using, a, torch, and, smoothed, using, a, hammer, or, file, a, draw, bench, or, arbor, press, equipped, with, expandable, lead, plug, is, used, to, shape, and, smooth, the, bell, and, bell, neck, over, a, mandrel, a, lathe, is, used, to, spin, the, bell, head, and, to, form, a, bead, at, the, edge, of, bell, head, previously, shaped, bell, necks, are, annealed, using, a, hand, torch, to, soften, the, metal, for, further, bending, scratches, are, removed, from, the, bell, using, abrasive, coated, cloth, a, few, specialty, instruments, are, made, from, wood, instruments, made, mostly, from, plastic, emerged, in, the, 2010s, as, a, cheaper, and, more, robust, alternative, to, brass, plastic, instruments, could, come, in, almost, any, colour, the, sound, plastic, instruments, produce, is, different, from, the, one, of, brass, lacquer, gold, or, silver, while, originally, seen, as, a, gimmick, these, plastic, models, have, found, increasing, popularity, during, the, last, decade, and, are, now, viewed, as, practice, tools, that, make, for, more, convenient, travel, as, well, as, a, cheaper, option, for, beginning, players, brass, instruments, are, one, of, the, major, classical, instrument, families, and, are, played, across, a, range, of, musical, ensembles, orchestras, include, a, varying, number, of, brass, instruments, depending, on, music, style, and, era, typically, concert, bands, generally, have, a, larger, brass, section, than, an, orchestra, typically, british, brass, bands, are, made, up, entirely, of, brass, mostly, conical, bore, instruments, typical, membership, is, quintets, are, common, small, brass, ensembles, a, quintet, typically, contains, big, bands, and, other, jazz, bands, commonly, contain, cylindrical, bore, brass, instruments, mexican, bandas, have, single, brass, instruments, are, also, often, used, to, accompany, other, instruments, or, ensembles, such, as, an, organ, or, a, choir
