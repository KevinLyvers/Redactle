match, into, outfits, that, depict, distinctive, ways, of, dressing, styles, and, trends, as, signifiers, of, social, status, self, expression, and, group, belonging, as, a, multifaceted, term, fashion, describes, an, industry, styles, aesthetics, and, trends, the, term, fashion, originates, from, the, latin, word, facere, which, means, to, make, and, describes, the, manufacturing, mixing, and, wearing, of, outfits, adorned, with, specific, cultural, aesthetics, patterns, motifs, shapes, and, cuts, allowing, people, to, showcase, their, group, belonging, values, meanings, beliefs, and, ways, of, life, given, the, rise, in, mass, production, of, commodities, and, clothing, at, lower, prices, and, global, reach, reducing, fashion, s, environmental, impact, and, improving, sustainability, has, become, an, urgent, issue, among, politicians, brands, and, consumers, the, french, word, mode, meaning, fashion, dates, as, far, back, as, 1482, while, the, english, word, denoting, something, in, style, dates, only, to, the, 16th, century, other, words, exist, related, to, concepts, of, style, and, appeal, that, precede, mode, in, the, 12th, and, 13th, century, old, french, the, concept, of, elegance, begins, to, appear, in, the, context, of, aristocratic, preferences, to, enhance, beauty, and, display, refinement, and, cointerie, the, idea, of, making, oneself, more, attractive, to, others, by, style, or, artifice, in, grooming, and, dress, appears, in, a, 13th, century, poem, by, guillaume, de, lorris, advising, men, that, handsome, clothes, and, handsome, accessories, improve, a, man, a, great, deal, fashion, scholar, susan, b, kaiser, states, that, everyone, is, forced, to, appear, unmediated, before, others, everyone, is, evaluated, by, their, attire, and, evaluation, includes, the, consideration, of, colors, materials, silhouette, and, how, garments, appear, on, the, body, garments, identical, in, style, and, material, also, appear, different, depending, on, the, wearer, s, body, shape, or, whether, the, garment, has, been, washed, folded, mended, or, is, new, fashion, is, defined, in, a, number, of, different, ways, and, its, application, can, be, sometimes, unclear, though, the, term, fashion, connotes, difference, as, in, the, new, fashions, of, the, season, it, can, also, connote, sameness, for, example, in, reference, to, the, fashions, of, the, 1960s, implying, a, general, uniformity, fashion, can, signify, the, latest, trends, but, may, often, reference, fashions, of, a, previous, era, leading, to, the, reappearance, of, fashions, from, a, different, time, period, while, what, is, fashionable, can, be, defined, by, a, relatively, insular, esteemed, and, often, rich, aesthetic, elite, who, make, a, look, exclusive, such, as, fashion, houses, and, haute, couturiers, this, look, is, often, designed, by, pulling, references, from, subcultures, and, social, groups, who, are, not, considered, elite, and, are, thus, excluded, from, making, the, distinction, of, what, is, fashion, themselves, whereas, a, trend, often, connotes, a, peculiar, aesthetic, expression, often, lasting, shorter, than, a, season, and, being, identifiable, by, visual, extremes, fashion, is, a, distinctive, and, industry, supported, expression, traditionally, tied, to, the, fashion, season, and, collections, style, is, an, expression, that, lasts, over, many, seasons, and, is, often, connected, to, cultural, movements, and, social, markers, symbols, class, and, culture, such, as, baroque, and, rococo, according, to, sociologist, pierre, bourdieu, fashion, connotes, the, latest, difference, even, though, the, terms, fashion, clothing, and, costume, are, often, used, together, fashion, differs, from, both, clothing, describes, the, material, and, the, technical, garment, devoid, of, any, social, meaning, or, connections, costume, has, come, to, mean, fancy, dress, or, masquerade, wear, fashion, by, contrast, describes, the, social, and, temporal, system, that, influences, and, activates, dress, as, a, social, signifier, in, a, certain, time, and, context, philosopher, giorgio, agamben, connects, fashion, to, the, qualitative, ancient, greek, concept, of, kairos, meaning, the, right, critical, or, opportune, moment, and, clothing, to, the, quantitative, concept, of, chronos, the, personification, of, chronological, or, sequential, time, while, some, exclusive, brands, may, claim, the, label, haute, couture, in, france, the, term, is, technically, limited, to, members, of, the, chambre, syndicale, de, la, haute, couture, in, paris, haute, couture, is, more, aspirational, inspired, by, art, and, culture, and, in, most, cases, reserved, for, the, economic, elite, however, new, york, s, fashion, calendar, hosts, couture, fashion, week, which, strives, for, a, more, equitable, and, inclusive, mission, fashion, is, also, a, source, of, art, allowing, people, to, display, their, unique, tastes, sensibilities, and, styles, different, fashion, designers, are, influenced, by, outside, stimuli, and, reflect, this, inspiration, in, their, work, for, example, gucci, s, stained, green, jeans, may, look, like, a, grass, stain, but, to, others, they, display, purity, freshness, and, summer, fashion, is, unique, self, fulfilling, and, may, be, a, key, part, of, someone, s, identity, similarly, to, art, the, aims, of, a, person, s, choices, in, fashion, are, not, necessarily, to, be, liked, by, everyone, but, instead, to, be, an, expression, of, personal, taste, a, person, s, personal, style, functions, as, a, societal, formation, always, combining, two, opposite, principles, it, is, a, socially, acceptable, and, secure, way, to, distinguish, oneself, from, others, and, at, the, same, time, it, satisfies, the, individual, s, need, for, social, adaptation, and, imitation, while, philosopher, immanuel, kant, believed, that, fashion, has, nothing, to, do, with, genuine, judgements, of, taste, and, was, instead, a, case, of, unreflected, and, blind, imitation, sociologist, georg, simmel, thought, of, fashion, as, something, that, helped, overcome, the, distance, between, an, individual, and, his, society, american, sociologist, diana, crane, also, mentioned, in, her, book, that, fashion, is, closely, intertwined, with, personal, and, group, identity, serving, as, a, means, of, expressing, cultural, social, and, political, affiliations, changes, in, clothing, often, took, place, at, times, of, economic, or, social, change, as, occurred, in, ancient, rome, and, the, medieval, caliphate, followed, by, a, long, period, without, significant, changes, in, eighth, century, moorish, spain, the, musician, ziryab, introduced, to, c, rdoba, sophisticated, clothing, styles, based, on, seasonal, and, daily, fashions, from, his, native, baghdad, modified, by, his, inspiration, similar, changes, in, fashion, occurred, in, the, 11th, century, in, the, middle, east, following, the, arrival, of, the, turks, who, introduced, clothing, styles, from, central, asia, and, the, far, east, early, western, travellers, who, visited, india, persia, turkey, or, china, would, frequently, remark, on, the, absence, of, change, in, fashion, in, those, countries, in, 1609, the, secretary, of, the, japanese, sh, gun, bragged, inaccurately, to, a, spanish, visitor, that, japanese, clothing, had, not, changed, in, over, a, thousand, years, 312, 313, however, these, conceptions, of, non, western, clothing, undergoing, little, if, any, evolution, are, generally, held, to, be, untrue, for, instance, there, is, considerable, evidence, in, ming, china, of, rapidly, changing, fashions, in, chinese, clothing, in, imperial, china, clothing, were, not, only, an, embodiment, of, freedom, and, comfort, or, used, to, cover, the, body, or, protect, against, the, cold, or, used, for, decorative, purposes, it, was, also, regulated, by, strong, sumptuary, laws, which, was, based, on, strict, social, hierarchy, system, and, the, ritual, system, of, the, chinese, society, 14, 15, it, was, expected, for, people, to, be, dressed, accordingly, to, their, gender, social, status, and, occupation, the, chinese, clothing, system, had, cleared, evolution, and, varied, in, appearance, in, each, period, of, history, 14, 15, however, ancient, chinese, fashion, like, in, other, cultures, was, an, indicator, of, the, socioeconomic, conditions, of, its, population, for, confucian, scholars, however, changing, fashion, was, often, associated, with, social, disorder, which, was, brought, by, rapid, commercialization, 204, clothing, which, experienced, fast, changing, fashion, in, ancient, china, was, recorded, in, ancient, chinese, texts, where, it, was, sometimes, referred, as, shiyang, contemporary, styles, and, was, associated, with, the, concept, of, fuyao, outrageous, dress, 44, which, typically, holds, a, negative, connotation, similar, changes, in, clothing, can, be, seen, in, japanese, clothing, between, the, genroku, period, and, the, later, centuries, of, the, edo, period, 1603, 1867, during, which, a, time, clothing, trends, switched, from, flashy, and, expensive, displays, of, wealth, to, subdued, and, subverted, ones, the, myth, on, the, lack, of, fashion, in, what, was, considered, the, orient, was, related, to, western, imperialism, also, often, accompanied, orientalism, and, european, imperialism, was, especially, at, its, highest, in, the, 19th, century, 10, in, the, 19th, century, time, europeans, described, china, in, binary, opposition, to, europe, describing, china, as, lacking, in, fashion, among, many, other, things, while, europeans, deliberately, placed, themselves, in, a, superior, position, when, they, would, compare, themselves, to, the, chinese, 10, as, well, as, to, other, countries, in, asia, 166, latent, orientalism, is, an, unconscious, untouchable, certainty, about, what, the, orient, is, static, and, unanimous, separate, eccentric, backward, silently, different, sensual, and, passive, it, has, a, tendency, towards, despotism, and, away, from, progress, its, progress, and, value, are, judged, in, comparison, to, the, west, so, it, is, the, other, many, rigorous, scholars, saw, the, orient, as, a, locale, requiring, western, attention, reconstruction, even, redemption, similar, ideas, were, also, applied, to, other, countries, in, the, east, asia, in, india, and, middle, east, where, the, perceived, lack, of, fashion, were, associated, with, offensive, remarks, on, the, asian, social, and, political, systems, 187, i, confess, that, the, unchanging, fashions, of, the, turks, and, other, eastern, peoples, do, not, attract, me, it, seems, that, their, fashions, tend, to, preserve, their, stupid, despotism, additionally, there, is, a, long, history, of, fashion, in, west, africa, cloth, was, used, as, a, form, of, currency, in, trade, with, the, portuguese, and, dutch, as, early, as, the, 16th, century, and, locally, produced, cloth, and, cheaper, european, imports, were, assembled, into, new, styles, to, accommodate, the, growing, elite, class, of, west, africans, and, resident, gold, and, slave, traders, there, was, an, exceptionally, strong, tradition, of, weaving, in, the, oyo, empire, and, the, areas, inhabited, by, the, igbo, people, the, beginning, in, europe, of, continual, and, accelerating, change, in, clothing, styles, can, be, fairly, reliably, dated, to, late, medieval, times, historians, including, james, laver, and, fernand, braudel, date, the, start, of, western, fashion, in, clothing, to, the, middle, of, the, 14th, century, 317, 62, though, they, tend, to, rely, heavily, on, contemporary, imagery, as, illuminated, manuscripts, were, not, common, before, the, 14th, century, the, most, dramatic, early, change, in, fashion, was, a, sudden, drastic, shortening, and, tightening, of, the, male, over, garment, from, calf, length, to, barely, covering, the, buttocks, sometimes, accompanied, with, stuffing, in, the, chest, to, make, it, look, bigger, this, created, the, distinctive, western, outline, of, a, tailored, top, worn, over, leggings, or, trousers, the, pace, of, change, accelerated, considerably, in, the, following, century, and, women, s, and, men, s, fashion, especially, in, the, dressing, and, adorning, of, the, hair, became, equally, complex, art, historians, are, therefore, able, to, use, fashion, with, confidence, and, precision, to, date, images, often, to, within, five, years, particularly, in, the, case, of, images, from, the, 15th, century, initially, changes, in, fashion, led, to, a, fragmentation, across, the, upper, classes, of, europe, of, what, had, previously, been, a, very, similar, style, of, dressing, and, the, subsequent, development, of, distinctive, national, styles, these, national, styles, remained, very, different, until, a, counter, movement, in, the, 17th, to, 18th, centuries, imposed, similar, styles, once, again, mostly, originating, from, ancien, r, gime, france, 317, 324, though, the, rich, usually, led, fashion, the, increasing, affluence, of, early, modern, europe, led, to, the, bourgeoisie, and, even, peasants, following, trends, at, a, distance, but, still, uncomfortably, close, for, the, elites, a, factor, that, fernand, braudel, regards, as, one, of, the, main, motors, of, changing, fashion, 313, 315, in, the, 16th, century, national, differences, were, at, their, most, pronounced, ten, 16th, century, portraits, of, german, or, italian, gentlemen, may, show, ten, entirely, different, hats, albrecht, d, rer, illustrated, the, differences, in, his, actual, or, composite, contrast, of, nuremberg, and, venetian, fashions, at, the, close, of, the, 15th, century, illustration, right, the, spanish, style, of, the, late, 16th, century, began, the, move, back, to, synchronicity, among, upper, class, europeans, and, after, a, struggle, in, the, mid, 17th, century, french, styles, decisively, took, over, leadership, a, process, completed, in, the, 18th, century, 317, 321, though, different, textile, colors, and, patterns, changed, from, year, to, year, the, cut, of, a, gentleman, s, coat, and, the, length, of, his, waistcoat, or, the, pattern, to, which, a, lady, s, dress, was, cut, changed, more, slowly, men, s, fashions, were, primarily, derived, from, military, models, and, changes, in, a, european, male, silhouette, were, galvanized, in, theaters, of, european, war, where, gentleman, officers, had, opportunities, to, make, notes, of, different, styles, such, as, the, steinkirk, cravat, or, necktie, both, parties, wore, shirts, under, their, clothing, the, cut, and, style, of, which, had, little, cause, to, change, over, a, number, of, centuries, though, there, had, been, distribution, of, dressed, dolls, from, france, since, the, 16th, century, and, abraham, bosse, had, produced, engravings, of, fashion, in, the, 1620s, the, pace, of, change, picked, up, in, the, 1780s, with, increased, publication, of, french, engravings, illustrating, the, latest, paris, styles, by, 1800, all, western, europeans, were, dressing, alike, or, thought, they, were, local, variation, became, first, a, sign, of, provincial, culture, and, later, a, badge, of, the, conservative, peasant, 317, 62, although, tailors, and, dressmakers, were, no, doubt, responsible, for, many, innovations, and, the, textile, industry, indeed, led, many, trends, the, history, of, fashion, design, is, generally, understood, to, date, from, 1858, when, the, english, born, charles, frederick, worth, opened, the, first, authentic, haute, couture, house, in, paris, the, haute, house, was, the, name, established, by, the, government, for, the, fashion, houses, that, met, the, standards, of, the, industry, these, fashion, houses, continue, to, adhere, to, standards, such, as, keeping, at, least, twenty, employees, engaged, in, making, the, clothes, showing, two, collections, per, year, at, fashion, shows, and, presenting, a, certain, number, of, patterns, to, costumers, since, then, the, idea, of, the, fashion, designer, as, a, celebrity, in, their, own, right, has, become, increasingly, dominant, although, fashion, can, be, feminine, or, masculine, additional, trends, are, androgynous, the, idea, of, unisex, dressing, originated, in, the, 1960s, when, designers, such, as, pierre, cardin, and, rudi, gernreich, created, garments, such, as, stretch, jersey, tunics, or, leggings, meant, to, be, worn, by, both, males, and, females, the, impact, of, unisex, wearability, expanded, more, broadly, to, encompass, various, themes, in, fashion, including, androgyny, mass, market, retail, and, conceptual, clothing, the, fashion, trends, of, the, 1970s, such, as, sheepskin, jackets, flight, jackets, duffel, coats, and, unstructured, clothing, influenced, men, to, attend, social, gatherings, without, a, dinner, jacket, and, to, accessorize, in, new, ways, some, men, s, styles, blended, the, sensuality, and, expressiveness, and, the, growing, gay, rights, movement, and, an, emphasis, on, youth, allowed, for, a, new, freedom, to, experiment, with, style, and, with, fabrics, such, as, wool, crepe, which, had, previously, been, associated, with, women, s, attire, the, four, major, current, fashion, capitals, are, acknowledged, to, be, new, york, city, manhattan, paris, milan, and, london, which, are, all, headquarters, to, the, most, significant, fashion, companies, and, are, renowned, for, their, major, influence, on, global, fashion, fashion, weeks, are, held, in, these, cities, where, designers, exhibit, their, new, clothing,

the, selection, of, their, clothes, what, a, person, chooses, to, wear, can, reflect, their, personality, or, interests, when, people, who, have, high, cultural, status, start, to, wear, new, or, different, styles, they, may, inspire, a, new, fashion, trend, people, who, like, or, respect, these, people, are, influenced, by, their, style, and, begin, wearing, similarly, styled, clothes, fashions, may, vary, considerably, within, a, society, according, to, age, social, class, generation, occupation, and, geography, and, may, also, vary, over, time, the, terms, fashionista, and, fashion, victim, refer, to, someone, who, slavishly, follows, current, fashions, in, the, early, 2000s, asian, fashion, influences, became, increasingly, significant, in, local, and, global, markets,

associated, with, a, preference, for, a, genre, of, music, like, music, news, or, literature, fashion, has, been, fused, into, everyday, lives, fashion, is, not, only, seen, as, purely, aesthetic, fashion, is, also, a, medium, for, people, to, create, an, overall, effect, and, express, their, opinions, and, overall, art, this, mirrors, what, performers, frequently, accomplish, through, music,

then, in, favour, the, annual, met, gala, ceremony, in, manhattan, is, the, premier, venue, where, fashion, designers, and, their, creations, are, celebrated, social, media, is, also, a, place, where, fashion, is, presented, most, often, some, influencers, are, paid, huge, amounts, of, money, to, promote, a, product, or, clothing, item, where, the, business, hopes, many, viewers, will, buy, the,

the, lgbt, fashion, design, community, contributes, very, significantly, to, promulgating, fashion, trends, and, drag, celebrities, have, developed, a, profound, influence, upon, new, york, fashion, week, consumers, of, different, groups, have, varying, needs, and, demands, factors, taken, into, consideration, when, analyzing, consumers, needs, include, key, demographics, to, understand, consumers, needs, and, predict, fashion, trends, fashion, companies, have, to, do, market, research, there, are, two, research, methods, primary, and, secondary, secondary, methods, are, taking, other, information, that, has, already, been, collected, for, example, using, a, book, or, an, article, for, research, primary, research, is, collecting, data, through, surveys, interviews, observation, and, or, focus, groups, primary, research, often, focuses, on, large, sample, sizes, to, determine, customer, s, motivations, to, shop, the, benefits, of, primary, research, are, specific, information, about, a, fashion, brand, s, consumer, is, explored, surveys, are, helpful, tools, questions, can, be, open, ended, or, closed, ended, negative, factor, surveys, and, interviews, present, is, that, the, answers, can, be, biased, due, to, wording, in, the, survey, or, on, face, to, face, interactions, focus, groups, about, 8, to, 12, people, can, be, beneficial, because, several, points, can, be, addressed, in, depth, however, there, are, drawbacks, to, this, tactic, too, with, such, a, small, sample, size, it, is, hard, to, know, if, the, greater, public, would, react, the, same, way, as, the, focus, group, observation, can, really, help, a, company, gain, insight, on, what, a, consumer, truly, wants, there, is, less, of, a, bias, because, consumers, are, just, performing, their, daily, tasks, not, necessarily, realizing, they, are, being, observed, for, example, observing, the, public, by, taking, street, style, photos, of, people, the, consumer, did, not, get, dressed, in, the, morning, knowing, that, would, have, their, photo, taken, necessarily, they, just, wear, what, they, would, normally, wear, through, observation, patterns, can, be, seen, helping, trend, forecasters, know, what, their, target, market, needs, and, wants, knowing, the, needs, of, consumers, will, increase, fashion, companies, sales, and, profits, through, research, and, studying, the, consumers, lives, the, needs, of, the, customer, can, be, obtained, and, help, fashion, brands, know, what, trends, the, consumers, are, ready, for, consumption, is, driven, not, only, by, need, the, symbolic, meaning, for, consumers, is, also, a, factor, consumers, engaging, in, symbolic, consumption, may, develop, a, sense, of, self, over, an, extended, period, of, time, as, various, objects, are, collected, as, part, of, the, process, of, establishing, their, identity, and, when, the, symbolic, meaning, is, shared, in, a, social, group, to, communicate, their, identity, to, others, for, teenagers, consumption, plays, a, role, in, distinguishing, the, child, self, from, the, adult, researchers, have, found, that, the, fashion, choices, of, teenagers, are, used, for, self, expression, and, also, to, recognize, other, teens, who, wear, similar, clothes, the, symbolic, association, of, clothing, items, can, link, individuals, personality, and, interests, with, music, as, a, prominent, factor, influencing, fashion, decisions, political, figures, have, played, a, central, role, in, the, development, of, fashion, at, least, since, the, time, of, french, king, louis, xiv, for, example, first, lady, jacqueline, kennedy, was, a, fashion, icon, of, the, early, 1960s, wearing, chanel, suits, structural, givenchy, shift, dresses, and, soft, color, cassini, coats, with, large, buttons, she, inspired, trends, of, both, elegant, formal, dressing, and, classic, feminine, style, cultural, upheavals, have, also, had, an, impact, on, fashion, trends, for, example, during, the, 1960s, the, u, s, economy, was, robust, the, divorce, rate, was, increasing, and, the, government, approved, the, birth, control, pill, these, factors, inspired, the, younger, generation, to, rebel, against, entrenched, social, norms, the, civil, rights, movement, a, struggle, for, social, justice, and, equal, opportunity, for, blacks, and, the, women, s, liberation, movement, seeking, equal, rights, and, opportunities, and, greater, personal, freedom, for, women, were, in, full, bloom, in, 1964, the, leg, baring, mini, skirt, was, introduced, and, became, a, white, hot, trend, fashion, designers, then, began, to, experiment, with, the, shapes, of, garments, loose, sleeveless, dresses, micro, minis, flared, skirts, and, trumpet, sleeves, fluorescent, colors, print, patterns, bell, bottom, jeans, fringed, vests, and, skirts, became, de, rigueur, outfits, of, the, 1960s, concern, and, protest, over, u, s, involvement, in, the, failing, vietnam, war, also, influenced, fashion, camouflage, patterns, in, military, clothing, developed, to, help, military, personnel, be, less, visible, to, enemy, forces, seeped, into, streetwear, designs, in, the, 1960s, camouflage, trends, have, disappeared, and, resurfaced, several, times, since, then, appearing, in, high, fashion, iterations, in, the, 1990s, designers, such, as, valentino, dior, and, dolce, gabbana, combined, camouflage, into, their, runway, and, ready, to, wear, collections, today, variations, of, camouflage, including, pastel, shades, in, every, article, of, clothing, or, accessory, continue, to, enjoy, popularity, today, technology, plays, a, sizable, role, in, society, and, technological, influences, are, correspondingly, increasing, within, the, realm, of, fashion, wearable, technology, has, become, incorporated, for, example, clothing, constructed, with, solar, panels, that, charge, devices, and, smart, fabrics, that, enhance, wearer, comfort, by, changing, color, or, texture, based, on, environmental, changes, 3d, printing, technology, has, influenced, designers, such, as, iris, van, herpen, and, kimberly, ovitz, as, the, technology, evolves, 3d, printers, will, become, more, accessible, to, designers, and, eventually, consumers, these, could, potentially, reshape, design, and, production, in, the, fashion, industry, entirely, internet, technology, enabling, the, far, reaches, of, online, retailers, and, social, media, platforms, has, created, previously, unimaginable, ways, for, trends, to, be, identified, marketed, and, sold, immediately, trend, setting, styles, are, easily, displayed, and, communicated, online, to, attract, customers, posts, on, instagram, or, facebook, can, quickly, increase, awareness, about, new, trends, in, fashion, which, subsequently, may, create, high, demand, for, specific, items, or, brands, new, buy, now, button, technology, can, link, these, styles, with, direct, sales, machine, vision, technology, has, been, developed, to, track, how, fashions, spread, through, society, the, industry, can, now, see, the, direct, correlation, on, how, fashion, shows, influence, street, chic, outfits, effects, such, as, these, can, now, be, quantified, and, provide, valuable, feedback, to, fashion, houses, designers, and, consumers, regarding, trends, the, fashion, industry, particularly, manufacture, and, use, of, apparel, and, footwear, is, a, significant, driver, of, greenhouse, gas, emissions, and, plastic, pollution, the, rapid, growth, of, fast, fashion, has, led, to, around, 80, billion, items, of, clothing, being, consumed, annually, with, about, 85, of, clothes, consumed, in, united, states, being, sent, to, landfill, less, than, one, percent, of, clothing, is, recycled, to, make, new, clothes, the, industry, was, estimated, to, produce, 10, of, all, greenhouse, gas, emissions, in, 2020, which, was, larger, than, the, emissions, produced, by, international, flights, and, maritime, shipping, combined, according, to, a, 2017, report, from, the, ellen, macarthur, foundation, if, the, fashion, sector, persists, on, its, same, trajectory, its, share, of, global, carbon, emissions, could, increase, to, 26, by, 2050, the, production, and, distribution, of, the, crops, fibers, and, garments, used, in, fashion, all, contribute, to, differing, forms, of, environmental, pollution, including, water, air, and, soil, degradation, the, textile, industry, is, the, second, greatest, polluter, of, local, freshwater, in, the, world, and, is, culpable, for, roughly, one, fifth, of, all, industrial, water, pollution, some, of, the, main, factors, that, contribute, to, this, industrial, caused, pollution, are, the, vast, overproduction, of, fashion, items, the, use, of, synthetic, fibers, the, agriculture, pollution, of, fashion, crops, and, the, proliferation, of, microfibers, across, global, water, sources, media, including, social, media, platforms, play, a, crucial, role, in, shaping, fashion, trends, creating, a, rapid, cycle, of, trend, adoption, and, obsolescence, for, instance, an, important, part, of, fashion, is, fashion, journalism, editorial, critique, guidelines, and, commentary, can, be, found, on, television, and, in, magazines, newspapers, fashion, websites, social, networks, and, fashion, blogs, in, recent, years, fashion, blogging, and, youtube, videos, have, become, a, major, outlet, for, spreading, trends, and, fashion, tips, creating, an, online, culture, of, sharing, one, s, style, on, a, website, or, social, media, accounts, i, e, instagram, tiktok, or, twitter, through, these, media, outlets, readers, and, viewers, all, over, the, world, can, learn, about, fashion, making, it, very, accessible, in, addition, to, fashion, journalism, another, media, platform, that, is, important, in, fashion, industry, is, advertisement, advertisements, provide, information, to, audiences, and, promote, the, sales, of, products, and, services, the, fashion, industry, uses, advertisements, to, attract, consumers, and, promote, its, products, to, generate, sales, a, few, decades, ago, when, technology, was, still, underdeveloped, advertisements, heavily, relied, on, radio, magazines, billboards, and, newspapers, these, days, there, are, more, various, ways, in, advertisements, such, as, television, ads, online, based, ads, using, internet, websites, and, posts, videos, and, live, streaming, in, social, media, platforms, there, are, two, subsets, of, print, styling, editorial, and, lifestyle, editorial, styling, is, the, high, fashion, styling, seen, in, fashion, magazines, and, this, tends, to, be, more, artistic, and, fashion, forward, lifestyle, styling, focuses, on, a, more, overtly, commercial, goal, like, a, department, store, advertisement, a, website, or, an, advertisement, where, fashion, is, not, what, s, being, sold, but, the, models, are, hired, to, promote, the, product, in, the, photo, the, dressing, practices, of, the, powerful, have, traditionally, been, mediated, through, art, and, the, practices, of, the, courts, the, looks, of, the, french, court, were, disseminated, through, prints, from, the, 16th, century, on, but, gained, cohesive, design, with, the, development, of, a, centralized, court, under, king, louis, xiv, which, produced, an, identifiable, style, that, took, his, name, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, fashion, magazines, began, to, include, photographs, of, various, fashion, designs, and, became, even, more, influential, than, in, the, past, in, cities, throughout, the, world, these, magazines, were, greatly, sought, after, and, had, a, profound, effect, on, public, taste, in, clothing, talented, illustrators, drew, exquisite, fashion, plates, for, the, publications, which, covered, the, most, recent, developments, in, fashion, and, beauty, perhaps, the, most, famous, of, these, magazines, was, la, gazette, du, bon, ton, which, was, founded, in, 1912, by, lucien, vogel, and, regularly, published, until, 1925, with, the, exception, of, the, war, years, vogue, founded, in, manhattan, in, 1892, has, been, the, longest, lasting, and, most, successful, of, the, hundreds, of, fashion, magazines, that, have, come, and, gone, increasing, affluence, after, world, war, ii, and, most, importantly, the, advent, of, cheap, color, printing, in, the, 1960s, led, to, a, huge, boost, in, its, sales, and, heavy, coverage, of, fashion, in, mainstream, women, s, magazines, followed, by, men, s, magazines, in, the, 1990s, one, such, example, of, vogue, s, popularity, is, the, younger, version, teen, vogue, which, covers, clothing, and, trends, that, are, targeted, more, toward, the, fashionista, on, a, budget, haute, couture, designers, followed, the, trend, by, starting, ready, to, wear, and, perfume, lines, which, are, heavily, advertised, in, the, magazines, and, now, dwarf, their, original, couture, businesses, a, recent, development, within, fashion, print, media, is, the, rise, of, text, based, and, critical, magazines, which, aim, to, prove, that, fashion, is, not, superficial, by, creating, a, dialogue, between, fashion, academia, and, the, industry, examples, of, this, development, are, fashion, theory, 1997, fashion, practice, the, journal, of, design, creative, process, the, fashion, industry, 2008, and, vestoj, 2009, television, coverage, began, in, the, 1950s, with, small, fashion, features, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, fashion, segments, on, various, entertainment, shows, became, more, frequent, and, by, the, 1980s, dedicated, fashion, shows, such, as, fashion, television, started, to, appear, fashiontv, was, the, pioneer, in, this, undertaking, and, has, since, grown, to, become, the, leader, in, both, fashion, television, and, new, media, channels, the, fashion, industry, is, beginning, to, promote, their, styles, through, bloggers, on, social, media, s, vogue, specified, chiara,

of, real, world, consumers, because, designers, release, their, fall, collections, in, the, spring, and, their, spring, collections, in, the, fall, fashion, magazines, such, as, vogue, always, and, only, look, forward, to, the, upcoming, season, promoting, parkas, come, september, while, issuing, reviews, on, shorts, in, january, she, writes, savvy, shoppers, consequently, have, been, conditioned, to, be, extremely, perhaps, impractically, farsighted, with, their, buying, the, fashion, industry, has, been, the, subject, of, numerous, films, and, television, shows, including, the, reality, show, project, runway, and, the, drama, series, ugly, betty, specific, fashion, brands, have, been, featured, in, film, not, only, as, product, placement, opportunities, but, as, bespoke, items, that, have, subsequently, led, to, trends, in, fashion, videos, in, general, have, been, very, useful, in, promoting, the, fashion, industry, this, is, evident, not, only, from, television, shows, directly, spotlighting, the, fashion, industry, but, also, movies, events, and, music, videos, which, showcase, fashion, statements, as, well, as, promote, specific, brands, through, product, placements, some, fashion, advertisements, have, been, accused, of, racism, and, led, to, boycotts, from, customers, globally, known, swedish, fashion, brand, h, m, faced, this, issue, with, one, of, its, children, s, wear, advertisements, in, 2018, a, black, child, wearing, a, hoodie, with, the, slogan, coolest, monkey, in, the, jungle, was, featured, in, the, ad, this, immediately, led, to, controversy, as, monkey, is, commonly, used, as, slur, against, black, people, and, caused, many, customers, to, boycott, the, brand, many, people, including, celebrities, posted, on, social, media, about, their, resentments, towards, h, m, and, refusal, to, work, with, and, buy, its, products, h, m, issued, a, statement, saying, we, apologise, to, anyone, this, may, have, offended, though, this,

viewers, harshly, criticized, it, claiming, it, shows, an, underlying, passive, racism, a, representative, from, the, root, commented, that, the, ad, portrays, the, message, that, black, people, are, undervalued, and, seen, as, props, for, white, people, to, look, better, others, saw, little, issue, with, the, ad, and, that, the, controversy, was, the, result, of, people, being, oversensitive,

yves, saint, laurent, also, faced, this, issue, with, its, print, ad, shown, in, paris, in, 2017, the, ad, depicted, a, female, model, wearing, fishnet, tights, with, roller, skate, stilettos, reclining, with, her, legs, opened, in, front, of, the, camera, this, advertisement, brought, harsh, comments, from, both, viewers, and, french, advertising, organization, directors, for, going, against, the, advertising, codes, related, to, respect, for, decency, dignity, and, those, prohibiting, submission, violence, or, dependence, as, well, as, the, use, of, stereotypes, and,

the, company, social, media, plays, an, important, role, in, modern, day, fashion, public, relations, enabling, practitioners, to, reach, a, wide, range, of, consumers, through, various, platforms, building, brand, awareness, and, credibility, is, a, key, implication, of, good, public, relations, in, some, cases, the, hype, is, built, about, new, designers, collections, before, they, are, released, into, the, market, due, to, the, immense, exposure, generated, by, practitioners, social, media, such, as, blogs, microblogs, podcasts, photo, and, video, sharing, sites, have, all, become, increasingly, important, to, fashion, public, relations, the, interactive, nature, of, these, platforms, allows, practitioners, to, engage, and, communicate, with, the, public, in, real, time, and, tailor, their, clients, brand, or, campaign, messages, to, the, target, audience, with, blogging, platforms, such, as, instagram, tumblr, wordpress, squarespace, and, other, sharing, sites, bloggers,

betty, pr, founder, roxy, jacenko, and, oscar, de, la, renta, s, pr, girl, erika, bearman, have, acquired, copious, followers, on, their, social, media, sites, by, providing, a, brand, identity, and, a, behind, the, scenes, look, into, the, companies, they, work, for, social, media, is, changing, the, way, practitioners, deliver, messages, as, they, are, concerned, with, the, media, and, also, customer, relationship, building, pr, practitioners, must, provide, effective, communication, among, all, platforms, in, order, to, engage, the, fashion, public, in, an, industry, socially, connected, via, online, shopping, consumers, have, the, ability, to, share, their, purchases, on, their, personal, social, media, pages, such, as, facebook, twitter, instagram, etc, and, if, practitioners, deliver, the, brand, message, effectively, and, meet, the, needs, of, its, public, word, of, mouth, publicity, will, be, generated, and, potentially, provide, a, wide, reach, for, the, designer, and, their, products, as, fashion, concerns, people, and, signifies, social, hierarchies, fashion, intersects, with, politics, and, the, social, organization, of, societies, whereas, haute, couture, and, business, suits, are, associated, by, people, in, power, also, groups, aiming, to, challenge, the, political, order, also, use, clothes, to, signal, their, position, the, explicit, use, of, fashion, as, a, form, of, activism, is, usually, referred, to, as, fashion, activism, there, is, a, complex, relationship, between, fashion, and, feminism, some, feminists, have, argued, that, by, participating, in, feminine, fashions, women, are, contributing, to, maintaining, the, gender, differences, which, are, part, of, women, s, oppression, brownmiller, felt, that, women, should, reject, traditionally, feminine, dress, focusing, on, comfort, and, practicality, rather, than, fashion, others, believe, that, it, is, the, fashion, system, itself, that, is, repressive, in, requiring, women, to, seasonally, change, their, clothes, to, keep, up, with, trends, greer, has, advocated, this, argument, that, seasonal, changes, in, dress, should, be, ignored, she, argues, that, women, can, be, liberated, by, replacing, the, compulsiveness, of, fashion, with, enjoyment, of, rejecting, the, norm, to, create, their, own, personal, styling, this, rejection, of, seasonal, fashion, led, to, many, protests, in, the, 1960s, alongside, rejection, of, fashion, on, socialist, racial, and, environmental, grounds, however, mosmann, has, pointed, out, that, the, relationship, between, protesting, fashion, and, creating, fashion, is, dynamic, because, the, language, and, style, used, in, these, protests, has, then, become, part, of, fashion, itself, fashion, designers, and, brands, have, traditionally, kept, themselves, out, of, political, conflicts, there, has, been, a, movement, in, the, industry, towards, taking, more, explicit, positions, across, the, political, spectrum, from, maintaining, a, rather, apolitical, stance, designers, and, brands, today, engage, more, explicitly, in, current, debates, for, example, considering, the, u, s, s, political, climate, in, the,

opportunity, to, take, political, stances, leveraging, their, platforms, and, influence, to, reach, their, customers, this, has, also, led, to, some, controversy, over, democratic, values, as, fashion, is, not, always, the, most, inclusive, platform, for, political, debate, but, a, one, way, broadcast, of, top, down, messages, when, taking, an, explicit, political, stance, designers, generally, favor, issues, that, can, be, identified, in, clear, language, with, virtuous, undertones, for, example, aiming, to, amplify, a, greater, message, of, unity, inclusion, diversity, and,

practice, or, expression, is, chosen, by, those, in, power, in, a, community, and, that, becomes, the, fashion, as, defined, at, a, certain, time, by, the, people, under, influence, of, those, in,

theorists, ted, polhemus, and, lynn, procter, one, can, describe, fashion, as, adornment, of, which, there, are, two, types, fashion, and, anti, fashion, through, the, capitalization, and, commoditization, of, clothing, accessories, and, shoes, etc, what, once, constituted, anti, fashion, becomes, part, of, fashion, as, the, lines, between, fashion, and, anti, fashion, are, blurred, as,

otherwise, traditional, clothing, where, specific, garments, and, their, designs, are, both, reproduced, faithfully, and, with, the, intent, of, maintaining, a, status, quo, of, tradition, this, can,
