faust, is, the, protagonist, of, a, classic, german, legend, based, on, the, historical, johann, georg, faust, c, 1480, 1540, the, erudite, faust, is, highly, successful, yet, dissatisfied, with, his, life, which, leads, him, to, make, a, pact, with, the, devil, at, a, crossroads, exchanging, his, soul, for, unlimited, knowledge, and, worldly, pleasures, the, faust, legend, has, been, the, basis, for, many, literary, artistic, cinematic, and, musical, works, that, have, reinterpreted, it, through, the, ages, faust, and, the, adjective, faustian, imply, sacrificing, spiritual, values, for, power, knowledge, or, material, gain, and, or, making, a, risky, bargain, with, seemingly, good, intentions, that, goes, terribly, wrong, the, faust, of, early, books, as, well, as, the, ballads, dramas, movies, and, puppet, plays, which, grew, out, of, them, is, irrevocably, damned, because, he, prefers, human, knowledge, over, divine, knowledge, he, laid, the, holy, scriptures, behind, the, door, and, under, the, bench, refused, to, be, called, doctor, of, theology, but, preferred, to, be, styled, doctor, of, medicine, plays, and, comic, puppet, theatre, loosely, based, on, this, legend, were, popular, throughout, germany, in, the, 16th, century, often, reducing, faust, and, mephistopheles, to, figures, of, vulgar, fun, the, story, was, popularised, in, england, by, christopher, marlowe, who, gave, it, a, classic, treatment, in, his, play, the, tragical, history, of, doctor, faustus, c, 1592, in, goethe, s, reworking, of, the, story, over, two, hundred, years, later, faust, becomes, a, dissatisfied, intellectual, who, yearns, for, more, than, earthly, meat, and, drink, in, his, life, faust, is, unsatisfied, with, his, life, as, a, scholar, and, becomes, depressed, after, an, attempt, to, take, his, own, life, he, calls, on, the, devil, for, further, knowledge, and, magic, powers, with, which, to, indulge, all, the, pleasure, and, knowledge, of, the, world, in, response, the, devil, s, representative, mephistopheles, appears, he, makes, a, bargain, with, faust, mephistopheles, will, serve, faust, with, his, magic, powers, for, a, set, number, of, years, but, at, the, end, of, the, term, the, devil, will, claim, faust, s, soul, and, faust, will, be, eternally, enslaved, during, the, term, of, the, bargain, faust, makes, use, of, mephistopheles, in, various, ways, in, goethe, s, drama, and, many, subsequent, versions, of, the, story, mephistopheles, helps, faust, seduce, a, beautiful, and, innocent, young, woman, usually, named, gretchen, whose, life, is, ultimately, destroyed, when, she, gives, birth, to, faust, s, illegitimate, son, realizing, this, unholy, act, she, drowns, the, child, and, is, sentenced, to, death, for, murder, however, gretchen, s, innocence, saves, her, in, the, end, and, she, enters, heaven, in, goethe, s, rendition, faust, is, saved, by, god, via, his, constant, striving, in, combination, with, gretchen, s, pleadings, with, god, in, the, form, of, the, eternal, feminine, however, in, the, early, versions, of, the, tale, faust, is, irrevocably, corrupted, and, believes, his, sins, cannot, be, forgiven, when, the, term, ends, the, devil, carries, him, off, to, hell, the, tale, of, faust, bears, many, similarities, to, the, theophilus, legend, recorded, in, the, 13th, century, writer, gautier, de, coincy, s, les, miracles, de, la, sainte, vierge, here, a, saintly, figure, makes, a, bargain, with, the, keeper, of, the, infernal, world, but, is, rescued, from, paying, his, debt, to, society, through, the, mercy, of, the, blessed, virgin, a, depiction, of, the, scene, in, which, he, subordinates, himself, to, the, devil, appears, on, the, north, tympanum, of, the, cathedrale, de, notre, dame, de, paris, the, origin, of, faust, s, name, and, persona, remains, unclear, in, the, historia, brittonum, faustus, is, the, offspring, of, an, incestuous, marriage, between, king, vortigern, and, vortigern, s, own, daughter, the, character, is, ostensibly, based, on, johann, georg, faust, c, 1480, 1540, a, magician, and, alchemist, probably, from, knittlingen, w, rttemberg, who, obtained, a, degree, in, divinity, from, heidelberg, university, in, 1509, but, the, legendary, faust, has, also, been, connected, with, an, earlier, johann, fust, c, 1400, 1466, johann, gutenberg, s, business, partner, which, suggests, that, fust, is, one, of, the, multiple, origins, to, the, faust, story, scholars, such, as, frank, baron, and, ruickbie, 2009, contests, many, of, these, previous, assumptions, the, character, in, polish, folklore, named, pan, twardowski, sir, twardowski, in, english, presents, similarities, with, faust, the, polish, story, seems, to, have, originated, at, roughly, the, same, time, as, its, german, counterpart, yet, it, is, unclear, whether, the, two, tales, have, a, common, origin, or, influenced, each, other, the, historical, johann, georg, faust, had, studied, in, krak, w, for, a, time, and, may, have, served, as, the, inspiration, for, the, character, in, the, polish, legend, the, first, known, printed, source, of, the, legend, of, faust, is, a, small, chapbook, bearing, the, title, historia, von, d, johann, fausten, published, in, 1587, the, book, was, re, edited, and, borrowed, from, throughout, the, 16th, century, other, similar, books, of, that, period, include, the, 1725, faust, chapbook, was, widely, circulated, and, also, read, by, the, young, goethe, related, tales, about, a, pact, between, man, and, the, devil, include, the, plays, mariken, van, nieumeghen, dutch, early, 16th, century, author, unknown, cenodoxus, german, early, 17th, century, by, jacob, bidermann, and, the, countess, cathleen, irish, legend, of, unknown, origin, believed, by, some, to, be, taken, from, the, french, play, les, marchands, d, mes, staufen, a, town, in, the, extreme, southwest, of, germany, claims, to, be, where, faust, died, c, 1540, depictions, appear, on, buildings, etc, the, only, historical, source, for, this, tradition, is, a, passage, in, the, chronik, der, grafen, von, zimmern, which, was, written, c, 1565, 25, years, after, faust, s, presumed, death, these, chronicles, are, generally, considered, reliable, and, in, the, 16th, century, there, were, still, family, ties, between, the, lords, of, staufen, and, the, counts, of, zimmern, in, nearby, donaueschingen, in, christopher, marlowe, s, original, telling, of, the, tale, wittenburg, where, faust, studied, was, also, written, as, wertenberge, this, has, led, to, a, measure, of, speculation, as, to, precisely, where, his, story, is, set, some, scholars, suggest, the, duchy, of, w, rttemberg, others, suggest, an, allusion, to, marlowe, s, own, cambridge, gill, 2008, p, 5, the, early, faust, chapbook, while, in, circulation, in, northern, germany, found, its, way, to, england, where, in, 1592, an, english, translation, was, published, the, historie, of, the, damnable, life, and, deserved, death, of, doctor, iohn, faustus, credited, to, a, certain, p, f, gent, christopher, marlowe, used, this, work, as, the, basis, for, his, more, ambitious, play, the, tragical, history, of, doctor, faustus, published, c, 1604, marlowe, also, borrowed, from, john, foxe, s, book, of, martyrs, on, the, exchanges, between, pope, adrian, vi, and, a, rival, pope, another, important, version, of, the, legend, is, the, play, faust, written, by, the, german, author, johann, wolfgang, von, goethe, the, first, part, which, is, the, one, more, closely, connected, to, the, earlier, legend, was, published, in, 1808, the, second, appeared, posthumously, in, 1832, goethe, s, faust, complicates, the, simple, christian, moral, of, the, original, legend, a, hybrid, between, a, play, and, an, extended, poem, goethe, s, two, part, closet, drama, is, epic, in, scope, it, gathers, together, references, from, christian, medieval, roman, eastern, and, hellenic, poetry, philosophy, and, literature, the, composition, and, refinement, of, goethe, s, own, version, of, the, legend, occupied, him, off, and, on, for, over, sixty, years, the, final, version, published, after, his, death, is, recognized, as, a, great, work, of, german, literature, the, story, concerns, the, fate, of, faust, in, his, quest, for, the, true, essence, of, life, was, die, welt, im, innersten, zusammenh, lt, frustrated, with, learning, and, the, limits, to, his, knowledge, power, and, enjoyment, of, life, he, attracts, the, attention, of, the, devil, represented, by, mephistopheles, who, makes, a, bet, with, faust, that, he, will, be, able, to, satisfy, him, faust, is, reluctant, believing, this, will, never, happen, this, is, a, significant, difference, between, goethe, s, faust, and, marlowe, s, faust, is, not, the, one, who, suggests, the, wager, in, the, first, part, mephistopheles, leads, faust, through, experiences, that, culminate, in, a, lustful, relationship, with, gretchen, an, innocent, young, woman, gretchen, and, her, family, are, destroyed, by, mephistopheles, deceptions, and, faust, s, desires, part, one, of, the, story, ends, in, tragedy, for, faust, as, gretchen, is, saved, but, faust, is, left, to, grieve, in, shame, the, second, part, begins, with, the, spirits, of, the, earth, forgiving, faust, and, the, rest, of, mankind, and, progresses, into, allegorical, poetry, faust, and, his, devil, pass, through, and, manipulate, the, world, of, politics, and, the, world, of, the, classical, gods, and, meet, with, helen, of, troy, the, personification, of, beauty, finally, in, anticipation, of, having, tamed, the, forces, of, war, and, nature, and, created, a, place, for, a, free, people, to, live, faust, is, happy, and, dies, mephistopheles, tries, to, seize, faust, s, soul, when, he, dies, after, this, moment, of, happiness, but, is, frustrated, and, enraged, when, angels, intervene, due, to, god, s, grace, though, this, grace, is, gratuitous, and, does, not, condone, faust, s, frequent, errors, with, mephistopheles, the, angels, state, that, this, grace, can, only, occur, because, of, faust, s, unending, striving, and, due, to, the, intercession, of, the, forgiving, gretchen, the, final, scene, has, faust, s, soul, carried, to, heaven, in, the, presence, of, god, by, the, intercession, of, the, virgin, mother, queen, goddess, kind, forever, eternal, womanhood, the, woman, is, thus, victorious, over, mephistopheles, who, had, insisted, at, faust, s, death, that, he, would, be, consigned, to, the, eternal, empty, goethe, s, faust, is, a, genuinely, classical, production, but, the, idea, is, a, historical, idea, and, hence, every, notable, historical, era, will, have, its, own, faust,

produces, works, of, increasing, beauty, to, universal, acclaim, even, while, physical, illness, begins, to, corrupt, his, body, in, 1930, when, presenting, his, final, masterwork, the, lamentation, of, dr, faust, he, confesses, the, pact, he, had, made, madness, and, syphilis, now, overcome, him, and, he, suffers, a, slow, and, total, collapse, until, his, death, in, 1940, leverk, hn, s, spiritual, mental, and, physical, collapse, and, degradation, are, mapped, on, to, the, period, in, which, nazism, rose, in, germany, and, leverk, hn, s, fate, is, shown, as, that, of, the, soul, of,

flees, along, a, winding, twisting, pathway, returning, to, his, study, chambers, at, pauses, along, this, retreat, though, he, meets, a, reappearing, figure, each, time, it, doffs, its, hat, in, a, greeting, that, is, mephisto, confronting, him, mephisto, overcomes, faust, s, reluctance, to, sign, a, long, binding, pact, with, the, invitation, that, faust, may, try, on, these, powers, just, for,
