and, have, been, criticized, for, being, derivative, and, formulaic, the, characters, are, often, said, to, be, two, dimensional, the, dialogue, wooden, and, the, storytelling, devices, such, as,

the, apes, just, so, he, could, find, out, how, bad, a, book, he, could, write, and, get, away, with, it, while, burroughs, was, not, a, polished, novelist, he, was, a, vivid, storyteller, most, of, his, novels, are, still, in, print, in, 1963, author, gore, vidal, wrote, a, piece, on, the, tarzan, series, that, while, pointing, out, several, of, the, deficiencies, that, the, tarzan, books, have, as, works, of, literature, praises, burroughs, for, creating, a, compelling, daydream, figure, critical, reception, grew, more, positive, with, the, 1981, study, by, erling, b, holtsmark, tarzan, and,

sustained, study, of, the, adolescent, period, of, the, fictional, tarzan, s, life, in, the, teenage, tarzan, despite, critical, panning, the, tarzan, stories, have, remained, popular, burroughs, s, melodramatic, situations, and, the, elaborate, details, he, works, into, his, fictional, world, such, as, his, construction, of, a, partial, language, for, his, great, apes, appeal, to, a, worldwide, fan, base, after, burroughs, s, death, a, number, of, writers, produced, new, tarzan, stories, in, some, instances, the, estate, managed, to, prevent, publication, of, such, works, the, most, notable, example, in, the, united, states, was, a, series, of, five, novels, by, the, pseudonymous, barton, werper, that, appeared, 1964, 65, by, gold, star, books, part, of, charlton, comics, as, a, result,

john, carter, as, early, inspirations, for, his, creation, of, superman, tarzan, s, popularity, inspired, numerous, imitators, in, pulp, magazines, a, number, of, these, like, kwa, and, ka, zar, were,

that, of, ordinary, humans, may, often, receive, the, nickname, tarzan, an, example, is, retired, american, baseball, player, joe, wallis, comedian, carol, burnett, was, often, prompted, by, her, audiences, to, perform, her, trademark, tarzan, yell, she, explained, that, it, originated, in, her, youth, when, she, and, a, friend, watched, a, tarzan, movie, stuart, j, byrne, in, the, 1950s, byrne, wrote, the, novel, tarzan, on, mar, s, under, the, pen, name, john, bloodstone, the, novel, is, a, crossover, of, the, tarzan, series, and, the, barsoom, series, john, carter, s, adventures, on, mars, however, he, did, not, obtain, a, license, to, publish, the, novel, which, had, unauthorized, editions, publisher, faber, and, faber, with, the, backing, of, the, edgar, rice, burroughs, incorporated, have, updated, the, series, through, author, andy, briggs, in, 2011, briggs, published, the, first, of, the, books, tarzan, the, greystoke, legacy, in, 2012, he, published, the, second, book, tarzan, the, jungle, warrior, and, in, 2013, he, has, published, the, third, book, tarzan, the, savage, lands, in, her, manliness, and, civilization, gail, bederman, describes, how, various, people, of, the, time, either, challenged, or, upheld, the, idea, that, civilization, is, predicated, on, white, masculinity, she, closes, with, a, chapter, on, tarzan, of, the, apes, 1912, because, the, story, s, protagonist, is, according, to, her, the, ultimate, male, by, the, standards, of, 1912, white, americans, bederman, does, note, that, tarzan, an, instinctively, chivalrous, anglo, saxon, does, not, engage, in, sexual, violence, renouncing, his, masculine, impulse, to, rape, however, she, also, notes, that, not, only, does, tarzan, kill, black, man, kulonga, in, revenge, for, killing, his, ape, mother, a, stand, in, for, his, biological, white, mother, by, hanging, him, lyncher, tarzan, actually, enjoys, killing, black, people, for, example, the, cannibalistic, mbongans, bederman, in, fact, reminds, readers, that, when, tarzan, first, introduces, himself, to, jane, he, does, so, as, tarzan, the, killer, of, beasts, and, many, black, men, the, novel, climaxes, with, tarzan, saving, jane, who, in, the, original, novel, is, not, british, but, a, southern, white, woman, from, baltimore, maryland, from, a, black, ape, rapist, when, he, leaves, the, jungle, and, sees, civilized, africans, farming, his, first, instinct, is, to, kill, them, just, for, being, black, like, the, lynch, victims, reported, in, the, northern, press, tarzan, s, victims, cowards, cannibals, and, despoilers, of, white, womanhood, lack, all, manhood, tarzan, s, lynchings, thus, prove, him, the, superior, man, according, to, bederman, despite, tarzan, embodying, all, the, tropes, of, white, supremacy, espoused, or, rejected, by, the, people, she, had, reviewed, theodore, roosevelt, g, stanley, hall, charlotte, perkins, gilman, ida, b, wells, burroughs, in, all, probability, was, not, trying, to, make, any, kind, of, statement, or, echo, any, of, them, he, probably, never, heard, of, any, of, them, instead, bederman, writes, that, burroughs, proves, her, point, because, in, telling, racist, and, sexist, stories, whose, protagonist, boasted, of, killing, black, people, he, was, not, being, unusual, at, all, but, was, instead, just, being, a, typical, 1912, white, american, the, tarzan, books, and, movies, employ, extensive, stereotyping, with, changing, social, views, and, customs, this, has, led, to, criticism, including, charges, of, racism, since, the, early, 1970s, the, early, books, give, a, pervasively, negative, and, stereotypical, portrayal, of, native, africans, including, arabs, in, the, return, of, tarzan, arabs, are, surly, looking, and, call, christians, dogs, while, black, africans, are, lithe, ebon, warriors, gesticulating, and, jabbering, in, regards, to, race, a, superior, inferior, relationship, with, valuation, is, implied, in, virtually, all, interactions, between, white, and, black, people, in, the, tarzan, stories, and, similar, relationships, and, valuations, can, be, seen, in, most, other, interactions, between, differing, people, according, to, james, loewen, s, sundown, towns, this, may, be, a, vestige, of, burroughs, s, having, been, from, oak, park, illinois, a, former, sundown, town, a, town, that, forbids, non, white, people, from, living, within, it, tarzan, is, a, white, european, male, who, grows, up, with, apes, according, to, taking, tarzan, seriously, by, marianna, torgovnick, tarzan, is, confused, with, the, social, hierarchy, that, he, is, a, part, of, unlike, everyone, else, in, his, society, tarzan, is, the, only, one, who, is, not, clearly, part, of, any, social, group, all, the, other, members, of, his, world, are, not, able, to, climb, or, decline, socially, because, they, are, already, part, of, a, social, hierarchy, which, is, stagnant, turgovnick, writes, that, since, tarzan, was, raised, as, an, ape, he, thinks, and, acts, like, an, ape, however, instinctively, he, is, human, and, he, resorts, to, being, human, when, he, is, pushed, to, the, reason, of, his, confusion, is, that, he, does, not, understand, what, the, typical, white, male, is, supposed, to, act, like, his, instincts, eventually, kick, in, when, he, is, in, the, midst, of, this, confusion, and, he, ends, up, dominating, the, jungle, in, tarzan, the, jungle, is, a, microcosm, for, the, world, in, general, in, 1912, to, the, early, 1930s, his, climbing, of, the, social, hierarchy, proves, that, the, european, white, male, is, the, most, dominant, of, all, races, sexes, no, matter, what, the, circumstance, furthermore, turgovnick, writes, that, when, tarzan, first, meets, jane, she, is, slightly, repulsed, but, also, fascinated, by, his, animal, like, actions, as, the, story, progresses, tarzan, surrenders, his, knife, to, jane, in, an, oddly, chivalrous, gesture, which, makes, jane, fall, for, tarzan, despite, his, odd, circumstances, turgovnick, believes, that, this, displays, an, instinctual, civilized, chivalry, that, burrough, believes, is, common, in, white, men, burroughs, s, opinions, manifested, through, the, narrative, voice, in, the, stories, reflect, common, western, attitudes, in, his, time, which, in, a, 21st, century, context, would, be, considered, racist, and,
