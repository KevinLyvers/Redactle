capital, a, critique, of, political, economy, german, das, kapital, kritik, der, politischen, konomie, also, known, as, capital, and, das, kapital, german, pronunciation, is, a, foundational, theoretical, text, in, materialist, philosophy, and, critique, of, political, economy, written, by, karl, marx, published, as, three, volumes, in, 1867, 1885, and, 1894, the, culmination, of, his, life, s, work, the, text, contains, marx, s, analysis, of, capitalism, to, which, he, sought, to, apply, his, theory, of, historical, materialism, to, lay, bare, the, economic, law, of, motion, of, modern, society, following, from, classical, political, economists, such, as, adam, smith, and, david, ricardo, the, text, s, second, and, third, volumes, were, completed, from, marx, s, notes, after, his, death, and, published, by, his, colleague, friedrich, engels, das, kapital, is, the, most, cited, book, in, the, social, sciences, published, before, 1950, marx, s, theory, of, historical, materialism, posits, that, the, economic, structure, of, society, in, particular, the, forces, and, relations, of, production, are, the, crucial, factors, in, shaping, its, nature, rather, than, a, simple, description, of, capitalism, as, an, economic, model, das, kapital, instead, examines, capitalism, as, a, historical, epoch, and, a, mode, of, production, and, seeks, to, trace, its, origins, development, and, decline, marx, argues, that, capitalism, is, a, form, of, economic, organization, which, has, arisen, and, developed, in, a, specific, historical, context, and, which, contains, tendencies, and, contradictions, which, will, inevitably, lead, to, its, decline, and, collapse, marx, considered, das, kapital, a, scientific, work, and, in, it, critiqued, both, the, system, and, bourgeois, political, economists, who, argue, that, it, is, efficient, and, stable, in, das, kapital, 1867, marx, proposes, that, the, motivating, force, of, capitalism, is, in, the, exploitation, of, labor, whose, unpaid, work, is, the, ultimate, source, of, surplus, value, the, owner, of, the, means, of, production, is, able, to, claim, the, right, to, this, surplus, value, because, they, are, legally, protected, by, the, ruling, regime, through, property, rights, and, the, legally, established, distribution, of, shares, which, are, by, law, distributed, only, to, company, owners, and, their, board, members, the, historical, section, shows, how, these, rights, were, acquired, in, the, first, place, chiefly, through, plunder, and, conquest, and, the, activity, of, the, merchant, and, middle, man, in, producing, capital, the, workers, continually, reproduce, the, economic, conditions, by, which, they, labour, das, kapital, proposes, an, explanation, of, the, laws, of, motion, of, the, capitalist, economic, system, from, its, origins, to, its, future, by, describing, the, dynamics, of, the, accumulation, of, capital, the, growth, of, wage, labour, the, transformation, of, the, workplace, the, concentration, of, capital, commercial, competition, the, banking, system, the, decline, of, the, profit, rate, land, rents, et, cetera, the, critique, of, the, political, economy, of, capitalism, proposes, after, two, decades, of, economic, study, and, preparatory, work, especially, regarding, the, theory, of, surplus, value, the, first, volume, appeared, in, 1867, as, the, production, process, of, capital, after, marx, s, death, in, 1883, engels, introduced, volume, ii, the, circulation, process, of, capital, in, 1885, and, volume, iii, the, overall, process, of, capitalist, production, in, 1894, from, manuscripts, and, the, first, volume, these, three, volumes, are, collectively, known, as, das, kapital, nml, das, kapital, volume, i, 1867, is, a, critical, analysis, of, political, economy, meant, to, reveal, the, contradictions, of, the, capitalist, mode, of, production, how, it, was, the, precursor, of, the, socialist, mode, of, production, and, of, the, class, struggle, rooted, in, the, capitalist, social, relations, of, production, the, first, of, three, volumes, of, das, kapital, was, published, on, 14, september, 1867, dedicated, to, wilhelm, wolff, and, was, the, sole, volume, published, in, marx, s, lifetime, das, kapital, volume, ii, subtitled, the, process, of, circulation, of, capital, was, prepared, by, engels, from, notes, left, by, marx, and, published, in, 1885, it, is, divided, into, three, parts, in, volume, ii, the, main, ideas, behind, the, marketplace, are, to, be, found, namely, how, value, and, surplus, value, are, realized, its, focuses, aren, t, so, much, the, worker, and, the, industrialist, as, in, volume, i, but, rather, the, money, owner, and, money, lender, the, wholesale, merchant, the, trader, and, the, entrepreneur, or, functioning, capitalist, moreover, workers, appear, in, volume, ii, essentially, as, buyers, of, consumer, goods, and, therefore, as, sellers, of, the, commodity, labour, power, rather, than, producers, of, value, and, surplus, value, although, this, latter, quality, established, in, volume, i, remains, the, solid, foundation, on, which, the, whole, of, the, unfolding, analysis, is, based, marx, wrote, in, a, letter, sent, to, engels, on, 30, april, 1868, in, book, 1, we, content, ourselves, with, the, assumption, that, if, in, the, self, expansion, process, 100, becomes, 110, the, latter, will, find, already, in, existence, in, the, market, the, elements, into, which, it, will, change, once, more, but, now, we, investigate, the, conditions, under, which, these, elements, are, found, at, hand, namely, the, social, intertwining, of, the, different, capitals, of, the, component, parts, of, capital, and, of, revenue, s, this, intertwining, conceived, as, a, movement, of, commodities, and, of, money, enabled, marx, to, work, out, at, least, the, essential, elements, if, not, the, definitive, form, of, a, coherent, theory, of, the, trade, cycle, based, upon, the, inevitability, of, periodic, disequilibrium, between, supply, and, demand, under, the, capitalist, mode, of, production, ernest, mandel, intro, to, volume, ii, of, capital, 1978, part, 3, is, the, point, of, departure, for, the, topic, of, capital, accumulation, which, was, given, its, marxist, treatment, later, in, detail, by, rosa, luxemburg, among, others, das, kapital, volume, iii, subtitled, the, process, of, capitalist, production, as, a, whole, was, prepared, by, engels, from, notes, left, by, marx, and, published, in, 1894, it, is, divided, into, seven, parts, the, work, is, best, known, today, for, part, 3, which, in, summary, says, that, as, the, organic, fixed, capital, requirements, of, production, rise, as, a, result, of, advancements, in, production, generally, the, rate, of, profit, tends, to, fall, this, result, which, orthodox, marxists, believe, is, a, principal, contradictory, characteristic, leading, to, an, inevitable, collapse, of, the, capitalist, order, was, held, by, marx, and, engels, to, as, a, result, of, various, contradictions, in, the, capitalist, mode, of, production, result, in, crises, whose, resolution, necessitates, the, emergence, of, an, entirely, new, mode, of, production, as, the, culmination, of, the, same, historical, dialectic, that, led, to, the, emergence, of, capitalism, from, prior, forms, the, third, volume, is, highly, controversial, peculiarly, the, tenth, chapter, as, some, economists, feel, like, marx, contradicted, himself, with, the, marxian, fundamental, value, theory, while, trying, to, tackle, the, transformation, problem, volume, 3, is, subtitled, the, process, of, capitalist, production, as, a, whole, and, is, concerned, primarily, with, the, internal, differentiation, of, the, capitalist, class, the, first, three, parts, are, concerned, with, the, division, of, surplus, value, amongst, individual, capitals, where, it, takes, the, form, of, profit, the, following, parts, are, concerned, with, merchants, capital, interest, bearing, capital, and, landed, capital, the, last, part, draws, the, whole, account, together, the, aim, of, the, volume, as, a, whole, is, to, locate, and, describe, the, concrete, forms, which, grow, out, of, the, movements, of, capital, as, a, whole, thus, the, various, forms, of, capital, approach, step, by, step, the, form, which, they, assume, on, the, surface, of, society, in, the, action, of, different, capitals, on, one, another, in, competition, and, in, the, ordinary, consciousness, of, the, agents, of, production, themselves, 25, clarke, in, volume, 3, as, in, his, earlier, text, the, german, ideology, marx, discusses, how, primitive, accumulation, alienates, humans, from, nature, 14, in, volume, 3, marx, also, describes, capitalism, as, producing, an, irreparable, rift, in, the, interdependent, connection, of, humans, and, nature, 14, the, purpose, of, das, kapital, 1867, was, a, scientific, foundation, for, the, politics, of, the, modern, labour, movement, the, analyses, were, meant, to, bring, a, science, by, criticism, to, the, point, where, it, can, be, dialectically, represented, and, so, reveal, the, law, of, motion, of, modern, society, to, describe, how, the, capitalist, mode, of, production, was, the, precursor, of, the, socialist, mode, of, production, the, argument, is, an, analysis, of, the, classical, economics, of, adam, smith, david, ricardo, john, stuart, mill, and, benjamin, franklin, drawing, on, the, dialectical, method, that, g, w, f, hegel, developed, in, science, of, logic, and, the, phenomenology, of, spirit, other, intellectual, influences, on, capital, were, the, french, socialists, charles, fourier, henri, de, saint, simon, jean, charles, l, onard, de, sismondi, and, pierre, joseph, proudhon, at, university, marx, wrote, a, dissertation, comparing, the, philosophy, of, nature, in, the, works, of, the, philosophers, democritus, circa, 460, 370, bc, and, epicurus, 341, 270, bc, the, logical, architecture, of, das, kapital, is, derived, in, part, from, the, politics, and, the, nicomachean, ethics, by, aristotle, including, the, fundamental, distinction, between, use, value, and, exchange, value, the, syllogisms, c, m, c, and, m, c, m, for, simple, commodity, circulation, and, the, circulation, of, value, as, capital, moreover, the, description, of, machinery, under, capitalist, relations, of, production, as, self, acting, automata, derives, from, aristotle, s, speculations, about, inanimate, instruments, capable, of, obeying, commands, as, the, condition, for, the, abolition, of, slavery, in, the, 19th, century, marx, s, research, of, the, available, politico, economic, literature, required, twelve, years, usually, in, the, british, library, in, london, at, the, time, of, his, death, 1883, marx, had, prepared, the, manuscript, for, das, kapital, volume, iv, a, critical, history, of, theories, of, surplus, value, of, his, time, the, 19th, century, based, on, the, earlier, manuscript, theories, of, surplus, value, 1862, 63, the, philosopher, karl, kautsky, 1854, 1938, published, a, partial, edition, of, marx, s, surplus, value, critique, and, later, published, a, full, three, volume, edition, as, theorien, ber, den, mehrwert, theories, of, surplus, value, 1905, 1910, the, first, volume, was, published, in, english, as, a, history, of, economic, theories, 1952, the, communist, party, of, the, soviet, union, published, its, own, edition, of, volume, iv, in, which, it, claimed, that, kautsky, s, edition, bastardized, the, original, text, with, their, version, containing, more, of, the, original, unedited, material, the, first, translated, publication, of, das, kapital, was, in, the, russian, empire, in, march, 1872, it, was, the, first, foreign, publication, with, the, french, edition, beginning, publication, in, august, 1872, and, the, english, edition, appearing, 15, years, later, in, 1887, it, was, even, published, before, the, first, modern, russian, translation, of, the, whole, bible, in, 1876, despite, russian, censorship, proscribing, the, harmful, doctrines, of, socialism, and, communism, the, russian, censors, considered, das, kapital, as, a, strictly, scientific, work, of, political, economy, the, content, of, which, did, not, apply, to, monarchic, russia, where, capitalist, exploitation, had, never, occurred, and, was, officially, dismissed, given, that, very, few, people, in, russia, will, read, it, and, even, fewer, will, understand, it, nonetheless, marx, acknowledged, that, russia, was, the, country, where, das, kapital, was, read, and, valued, more, than, anywhere, for, instance, the, russian, edition, was, the, fastest, selling, as, 3, 000, copies, were, sold, in, one, year, while, the, german, edition, took, five, years, to, sell, 1, 000, therefore, the, russian, translation, sold, fifteen, times, faster, than, the, german, original, this, edition, was, in, part, worked, on, by, revolutionary, socialist, mikhail, bakunin, but, he, quit, after, completing, part, of, the, first, chapter, and, it, was, completed, by, nikolai, danielson, and, german, lopatin, among, others, marx, revised, rewrote, and, monitored, a, french, translation, published, in, 44, installments, from, august, 1872, through, may, 1875, and, then, as, a, single, work, with, a, printing, of, ten, thousand, copies, the, largest, up, until, then, eventually, marx, s, work, was, translated, into, all, major, languages, the, definitive, critical, edition, of, marx, s, works, known, as, mega, ii, marx, engels, gesamtausgabe, includes, das, kapital, in, german, only, the, first, volume, is, in, french, and, shows, all, the, versions, and, alterations, made, to, the, text, as, well, as, a, very, extensive, apparatus, of, footnotes, and, cross, references, the, first, unabridged, translation, of, das, kapital, to, bengali, was, done, by, professor, piyush, dasgupta, it, was, published, in, six, volumes, by, baniprakash, kolkata, india, between, 1974, and, 1983, in, 2012, red, quill, books, released, capital, in, manga, a, comic, book, version, of, volume, i, which, is, an, expanded, english, translation, of, the, successful, 2008, japanese, pocket, version, das, kapital, known, as, manga, de, dokuha, the, english, translation, of, volume, 1, by, samuel, moore, and, eleanor, marx, s, partner, edward, aveling, overseen, by, engels, was, published, in, 1887, as, capital, a, critical, analysis, of, capitalist, production, by, swan, sonnenschein, lowrey, co, this, was, reissued, in, the, 1970s, by, progress, publishers, in, moscow, while, a, more, recent, english, translation, was, made, by, ben, fowkes, and, david, fernbach, the, penguin, edition, in, 2024, princeton, university, press, published, the, first, english, translation, of, the, second, german, edition, of, capital, volume, 1, edited, and, translated, by, paul, north, and, paul, reitter, volumes, 2, and, 3, are, forthcoming, in, 2017, the, historian, gareth, stedman, jones, wrote, in, the, books, and, arts, section, of, the, scientific, journal, nature, what, is, extraordinary, about, das, kapital, is, that, it, offers, a, still, unrivalled, picture, of, the, dynamism, of, capitalism, and, its, transformation, of, societies, on, a, global, scale, it, firmly, embedded, concepts, such, as, commodity, and, capital, in, the, lexicon, and, it, highlights, some, of, the, vulnerabilities, of, capitalism, including, its, unsettling, disruption, of, states, and, political, systems, if, das, kapital, has, now, emerged, as, one, of, the, great, landmarks, of, nineteenth, century, thought, it, is, critical, analysis, of, the, economy, of, his, time, with, its, historical, roots, in, doing, so, he, inaugurated, a, debate, about, how, best, to, reform, or, transform, politics, and, social, relations, which, has, gone, on, ever, since, positive, reception, also, cited, the, soundness, of, the, methodology, used, in, producing, the, book, which, is, called, immanent, critique, this, approach, which, starts, from, simple, category, and, gradually, unfolds, into, complex, categories, employed, internal, criticism, that, finds, contradiction, within, and, between, categories, while, discovering, aspects, of, reality, that, the, categories, cannot, explain, this, meant, that, marx, had, to, build, his, arguments, on, historical, narratives, and, empirical, evidence, rather, than, the, arbitrary, application, of, his, ideas, in, his, evaluation, of, capitalism, on, the, other, hand, das, kapital, has, also, received, criticism, there, are, theorists, who, claimed, that, this, text, was, unable, to, reconcile, capitalist, exploitation, with, prices, dependent, upon, subjective, wants, in, exchange, relations, marxists, generally, reply, that, only, socially, necessary, labor, time, that, is, labor, which, is, spent, on, commodities, for, which, there, is, market, demand, can, be, considered, productive, labour, and, therefore, exploited, on, marx, s, account, there, are, also, those, who, argued, that, marx, s, so, called, immiseration, thesis, is, presumed, to, mean, that, the, proletariat, is, absolutely, immiserated, the, existing, scholarly, consensus, tends, towards, the, opposite, view, that, marx, believed, that, only, relative, immiseration, would, occur, that, is, a, fall, in, labor, s, share, of, output, marx, himself, frequently, polemicized, against, the, view, that, the, amount, of, real, wages, is, a, fixed, amount
