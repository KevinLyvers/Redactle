plucked, the, flute, is, a, member, of, a, family, of, musical, instruments, in, the, woodwind, group, like, all, woodwinds, flutes, are, aerophones, producing, sound, with, a, vibrating, column, of, air, flutes, produce, sound, when, the, player, s, air, flows, across, an, opening, in, the, hornbostel, sachs, classification, system, flutes, are, edge, blown, aerophones, a, musician, who, plays, the, flute, is, called, a, flautist, or, flutist, paleolithic, flutes, with, hand, bored, holes, are, the, earliest, known, identifiable, musical, instruments, a, number, of, flutes, dating, to, about, 53, 000, to, 45, 000, years, ago, have, been, found, in, the, swabian, jura, region, of, present, day, germany, indicating, a, developed, musical, tradition, from, the, earliest, period, of, modern, human, presence, in, europe, while, the, oldest, flutes, currently, known, were, found, in, europe, asia, also, has, a, long, history, with, the, instrument, a, playable, bone, flute, discovered, in, china, is, dated, to, about, 9, 000, years, ago, the, americas, also, had, an, ancient, flute, culture, with, instruments, found, in, caral, peru, dating, back, 5, 000, years, and, in, labrador, dating, back, about, 7, 500, years, the, bamboo, flute, has, a, long, history, especially, in, china, and, india, flutes, have, been, discovered, in, historical, records, and, artworks, starting, in, the, zhou, dynasty, c, 1046, 256, bc, the, oldest, written, sources, reveal, the, chinese, were, using, the, kuan, a, reed, instrument, and, hsio, or, xiao, an, end, blown, flute, often, of, bamboo, in, the, 12th, 11th, centuries, bc, followed, by, the, chi, or, ch, ih, in, the, 9th, century, bc, and, the, y, eh, in, the, 8th, century, bc, of, these, the, bamboo, chi, is, the, oldest, documented, transverse, flute, musicologist, curt, sachs, called, the, cross, flute, sanskrit, v, the, outstanding, wind, instrument, of, ancient, india, and, said, that, religious, artwork, depicting, celestial, music, instruments, was, linked, to, music, with, an, aristocratic, character, the, indian, bamboo, cross, flute, bansuri, was, sacred, to, krishna, who, is, depicted, with, the, instrument, in, hindu, art, in, india, the, cross, flute, appeared, in, reliefs, from, the, 1st, century, ad, at, sanchi, and, amaravati, from, the, 2nd, 4th, centuries, ad, according, to, historian, alexander, buchner, there, were, flutes, in, europe, in, prehistoric, times, but, they, disappeared, from, the, continent, until, flutes, arrived, from, asia, by, way, of, north, africa, hungary, and, bohemia, the, end, blown, flute, began, to, be, seen, in, illustration, in, the, 11th, century, transverse, flutes, entered, europe, through, byzantium, and, were, depicted, in, greek, art, about, 800, ad, the, transverse, flute, had, spread, into, europe, by, way, of, germany, and, was, known, as, the, german, flute, the, word, flute, first, appeared, in, the, english, language, during, the, middle, english, period, as, floute, flowte, or, flo, y, te, possibly, from, old, french, flaute, and, old, proven, al, fla, t, or, possibly, from, old, french, fle, te, fla, te, flahute, via, middle, high, german, floite, or, dutch, fluit, the, english, verb, flout, has, the, same, linguistic, root, and, the, modern, dutch, verb, fluiten, still, shares, the, two, meanings, attempts, to, trace, the, word, back, to, the, latin, flare, to, blow, inflate, have, been, called, phonologically, impossible, or, inadmissable, the, first, known, use, of, the, word, flute, was, in, the, 14th, century, according, to, the, oxford, english, dictionary, this, was, in, geoffrey, chaucer, s, the, hous, of, fame, c, 1380, a, musician, who, plays, any, instrument, in, the, flute, family, can, be, called, a, flutist, flautist, or, flute, player, flutist, dates, back, to, at, least, 1603, the, earliest, quotation, cited, by, the, oxford, english, dictionary, flautist, was, used, in, 1860, by, nathaniel, hawthorne, in, the, marble, faun, after, being, adopted, during, the, 18th, century, from, italy, flautista, itself, from, flauto, like, many, musical, terms, in, england, since, the, italian, renaissance, other, english, terms, now, virtually, obsolete, are, fluter, 15th, 19th, centuries, and, flutenist, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, a, fragment, of, a, juvenile, cave, bear, s, femur, with, two, to, four, holes, was, found, at, divje, babe, in, slovenia, and, dated, to, about, 43, 000, years, ago, it, may, be, the, oldest, flute, discovered, but, this, has, been, disputed, in, 2008, a, flute, dated, to, at, least, 35, 000, years, ago, was, discovered, in, hohle, fels, cave, near, ulm, germany, it, is, a, five, holed, flute, with, a, v, shaped, mouthpiece, and, was, made, from, a, vulture, wing, bone, the, discovery, was, published, in, the, journal, nature, in, august, 2009, this, was, the, oldest, confirmed, musical, instrument, ever, found, until, a, redating, of, flutes, found, in, gei, enkl, sterle, cave, revealed, them, to, be, older, at, 42, 000, to, 43, 000, years, the, hohle, fels, flute, is, one, of, several, found, in, the, hohle, fels, cavern, next, to, the, venus, of, hohle, fels, and, a, short, distance, from, the, oldest, known, human, carving, on, announcing, the, discovery, scientists, suggested, that, the, finds, demonstrate, the, presence, of, a, well, established, musical, tradition, at, the, time, when, modern, humans, colonized, europe, scientists, have, also, suggested, that, this, flute, s, discovery, may, help, to, explain, the, probable, behavioural, and, cognitive, gulf, between, neanderthals, and, early, modern, human, an, 18, 7, cm, flute, with, three, holes, made, from, a, mammoth, tusk, and, dated, to, 30, 000, 37, 000, years, ago, was, found, in, 2004, in, the, gei, enkl, sterle, cave, near, ulm, in, the, southern, german, swabian, alb, two, flutes, made, from, swan, bones, were, excavated, a, decade, earlier, from, the, same, cave, and, dated, to, about, 36, 000, years, ago, a, playable, 9, 000, year, old, chinese, gudi, literally, bone, flute, was, excavated, from, a, tomb, in, jiahu, along, with, 29, similar, specimens, they, were, made, from, the, wing, bones, of, red, crowned, cranes, and, each, has, five, to, eight, holes, the, earliest, extant, chinese, transverse, flute, is, a, chi, flute, discovered, in, the, tomb, of, marquis, yi, of, zeng, at, the, suizhou, site, hubei, province, china, dating, from, 433, bc, during, the, later, zhou, dynasty, it, is, fashioned, of, lacquered, bamboo, with, closed, ends, and, has, five, stops, on, the, flute, s, side, instead, of, the, top, shi, jing, traditionally, said, to, have, been, compiled, and, edited, by, confucius, mentions, chi, flutes, the, earliest, written, reference, to, a, flute, is, from, a, sumerian, language, cuneiform, tablet, dated, to, c, 2600, 2700, bc, flutes, are, mentioned, in, a, recently, translated, tablet, of, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, an, epic, poem, whose, development, spanned, the, period, from, about, 2100, 600, bc, a, set, of, cuneiform, tablets, knows, as, the, musical, texts, provide, precise, tuning, instructions, for, seven, scales, of, a, stringed, instrument, assumed, to, be, a, babylonian, lyre, one, of, those, scales, is, named, emb, bum, which, is, an, akkadian, word, for, flute, the, bible, in, genesis, 4, 21, cites, jubal, as, being, the, father, of, all, those, who, play, the, ugab, and, the, kinnor, the, former, hebrew, term, is, believed, by, some, to, refer, to, a, wind, instrument, or, wind, instruments, in, general, the, latter, to, a, stringed, instrument, or, stringed, instruments, in, general, as, such, jubal, is, regarded, in, the, judeo, christian, tradition, as, the, inventor, of, the, flute, a, word, used, in, some, translations, of, this, biblical, passage, in, other, sections, of, the, bible, 1, samuel, 10, 5, 1, kings, 1, 40, isaiah, 5, 12, and, 30, 29, and, jeremiah, 48, 36, the, flute, is, referred, to, as, chalil, from, the, root, word, for, hollow, archeological, digs, in, the, holy, land, have, discovered, flutes, from, the, bronze, age, c, 4000, 1200, bc, and, the, iron, age, 1200, 586, bc, the, latter, era, witness, the, creation, of, the, israelite, kingdom, and, its, separation, into, the, two, kingdoms, of, israel, and, judea, some, early, flutes, were, made, out, of, tibias, shin, bones, the, flute, has, also, always, been, an, essential, part, of, indian, culture, and, the, cross, flute, believed, by, several, accounts, to, originate, in, india, as, indian, literature, from, 1500, bc, has, made, vague, references, to, the, cross, flute, a, flute, produces, sound, when, a, stream, of, air, directed, across, a, hole, in, the, instrument, creates, a, vibration, of, air, at, the, hole, the, airstream, creates, a, bernoulli, or, siphon, this, excites, the, air, contained, in, the, resonant, cavity, usually, cylindrical, within, the, flute, the, flutist, changes, the, pitch, of, the, sound, produced, by, opening, and, closing, holes, in, the, body, of, the, instrument, thus, changing, the, effective, length, of, the, resonator, and, its, corresponding, resonant, frequency, by, varying, the, air, pressure, a, flutist, can, also, change, the, pitch, by, causing, the, air, in, the, flute, to, resonate, at, a, harmonic, rather, than, the, fundamental, frequency, without, opening, or, closing, any, of, the, holes, head, joint, geometry, appears, particularly, critical, to, acoustic, performance, and, tone, but, there, is, no, clear, consensus, among, manufacturers, on, a, particular, shape, acoustic, impedance, of, the, embouchure, hole, appears, the, most, critical, parameter, critical, variables, affecting, this, acoustic, impedance, include, the, length, of, the, chimney, the, hole, between, the, lip, plate, and, the, head, tube, chimney, diameter, and, radii, or, curvature, of, the, ends, of, the, chimney, and, any, designed, restriction, in, the, throat, of, the, instrument, such, as, that, in, the, japanese, nohkan, flute, a, study, in, which, professional, flutists, were, blindfolded, could, find, no, significant, differences, between, flutes, made, from, a, variety, of, metals, in, two, different, sets, of, blind, listening, no, flute, was, correctly, identified, in, a, first, listening, and, in, a, second, only, the, silver, flute, was, identified, the, study, concluded, that, there, was, no, evidence, that, the, wall, material, has, any, appreciable, effect, on, the, sound, color, or, dynamic, range, historically, flutes, were, most, commonly, made, of, reed, bamboo, wood, or, other, organic, materials, they, were, also, made, of, glass, bone, and, nephrite, most, modern, flutes, are, made, of, metal, primarily, silver, and, nickel, silver, is, less, common, than, silver, alloys, other, materials, used, for, flutes, include, gold, platinum, grenadilla, and, copper, in, its, most, basic, form, a, flute, is, an, open, tube, which, is, blown, into, after, focused, study, and, training, players, use, controlled, air, direction, to, create, an, airstream, in, which, the, air, is, aimed, downward, into, the, tone, hole, of, the, flute, s, headjoint, there, are, several, broad, classes, of, flutes, with, most, flutes, the, musician, blows, directly, across, the, edge, of, the, mouthpiece, with, 1, 4, of, their, bottom, lip, covering, the, embouchure, hole, however, some, flutes, such, as, the, whistle, gemshorn, flageolet, recorder, tin, whistle, tonette, fujara, and, ocarina, have, a, duct, that, directs, the, air, onto, the, edge, an, arrangement, that, is, termed, a, fipple, these, are, known, as, fipple, flutes, the, fipple, gives, the, instrument, a, distinct, timbre, which, is, different, from, non, fipple, flutes, and, makes, the, instrument, easier, to, play, but, takes, a, degree, of, control, away, from, the, musician, another, division, is, between, side, blown, or, transverse, flutes, such, as, the, western, concert, flute, piccolo, fife, dizi, and, bansuri, and, end, blown, flutes, such, as, the, ney, xiao, kaval, danso, shakuhachi, anasazi, flute, and, quena, the, player, of, a, side, blown, flute, uses, a, hole, on, the, side, of, the, tube, to, produce, a, tone, instead, of, blowing, on, an, end, of, the, tube, end, blown, flutes, should, not, be, confused, with, fipple, flutes, such, as, the, recorder, which, are, also, played, vertically, but, have, an, internal, duct, to, direct, the, air, flow, across, the, edge, of, the, tone, hole, flutes, may, be, open, at, one, or, both, ends, the, ocarina, xun, pan, pipes, police, whistle, and, bosun, s, whistle, are, closed, ended, open, ended, flutes, such, as, the, concert, flute, and, the, recorder, have, more, harmonics, and, thus, more, flexibility, for, the, player, and, brighter, timbres, an, organ, pipe, may, be, either, open, or, closed, depending, on, the, sound, desired, flutes, may, have, any, number, of, pipes, or, tubes, though, one, is, the, most, common, number, flutes, with, multiple, resonators, may, be, played, one, resonator, at, a, time, as, is, typical, with, pan, pipes, or, more, than, one, at, a, time, as, is, typical, with, double, flutes, flutes, can, be, played, with, several, different, air, sources, conventional, flutes, are, blown, with, the, mouth, although, some, cultures, use, nose, flutes, the, flue, pipes, of, organs, which, are, acoustically, similar, to, duct, flutes, are, blown, by, bellows, or, fans, usually, in, d, wooden, transverse, flutes, were, played, in, european, classical, music, mainly, in, the, period, from, the, early, 18th, century, to, the, early, 19th, century, as, such, the, instrument, is, often, indicated, as, baroque, flute, gradually, marginalized, by, the, western, concert, flute, in, the, 19th, century, baroque, flutes, were, again, played, from, the, late, 20th, century, as, part, of, the, historically, informed, performance, practice, the, western, concert, flute, a, descendant, of, the, medieval, german, flute, is, a, transverse, treble, flute, that, is, closed, at, the, top, an, embouchure, hole, is, positioned, near, the, top, and, the, flutist, blows, across, it, the, flute, has, circular, tone, holes, larger, than, the, finger, holes, of, its, baroque, predecessors, the, size, and, placement, of, tone, holes, key, mechanism, and, fingering, system, used, to, produce, the, notes, in, the, flute, s, range, were, evolved, from, 1832, to, 1847, by, theobald, boehm, who, helped, greatly, improve, the, instrument, s, dynamic, range, and, intonation, over, its, predecessors, with, some, refinements, and, the, rare, exception, of, the, kingma, system, and, other, custom, adapted, fingering, systems, western, concert, flutes, typically, conform, to, boehm, s, design, known, as, the, boehm, system, beginner, s, flutes, are, made, of, nickel, silver, or, brass, that, is, silver, plated, while, professionals, use, solid, silver, gold, and, sometimes, even, platinum, flutes, there, are, also, modern, wooden, bodied, flutes, usually, with, silver, or, gold, keywork, the, wood, is, usually, african, blackwood, the, standard, concert, flute, is, pitched, in, c, and, has, a, range, of, three, octaves, starting, from, middle, c, or, one, half, step, lower, when, a, b, foot, is, attached, this, means, that, the, concert, flute, is, one, of, the, highest, pitched, common, orchestra, and, concert, band, instruments, the, piccolo, plays, an, octave, higher, than, the, regular, treble, flute, lower, members, of, the, flute, family, include, the, g, alto, and, c, bass, flutes, that, are, used, occasionally, and, are, pitched, a, perfect, fourth, and, an, octave, below, the, concert, flute, respectively, the, contra, alto, contrabass, subcontrabass, double, contrabass, and, hyperbass, flutes, are, other, rare, forms, of, the, flute, pitched, up, to, four, octaves, below, middle, c, other, sizes, of, flutes, and, piccolos, are, used, from, time, to, time, a, rarer, instrument, of, the, modern, pitching, system, is, the, g, treble, flute, instruments, made, according, to, an, older, pitch, standard, used, principally, in, wind, band, music, include, d, piccolo, e, soprano, flute, keyed, a, minor, 3rd, above, the, standard, c, flute, f, alto, flute, and, b, bass, flute, the, bamboo, flute, is, an, important, instrument, in, indian, classical, music, and, developed, independently, of, the, western, flute, the, hindu, god, lord, krishna, is, traditionally, considered, a, master, of, the, bamboo, flute, the, indian, flutes, are, very, simple, compared, to, the, western, counterparts, they, are, made, of, bamboo, and, are, keyless, two, main, varieties, of, indian, flutes, are, currently, used, the, first, the, bansuri, has, six, finger, holes, and, one, embouchure, hole, and, is, used, predominantly, in, the, hindustani, music, of, northern, india, the, second, the, venu, or, pullanguzhal, has, eight, finger, holes, and, is, played, predominantly, in, the, carnatic, music, of, southern, india, presently, the, eight, holed, flute, with, cross, fingering, technique, is, common, among, many, carnatic, flutists, prior, to, this, the, south, indian, flute, had, only, seven, finger, holes, with, the, fingering, standard, developed, by, sharaba, shastri, of, the, palladam, school, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, the, quality, of, the, flute, s, sound, depends, somewhat, on, the, specific, bamboo, used, to, make, it, and, it, is, generally, agreed, that, the, best, bamboo, grows, in, the, nagercoil, area, of, south, india, in, 1998, bharata, natya, shastra, sarana, chatushtai, avinash, balkrishna, patwardhan, developed, a, methodology, to, produce, perfectly, tuned, flutes, for, the, ten, thatas, currently, present, in, indian, classical, music, in, a, regional, dialect, of, gujarati, a, flute, is, also, called, pavo, some, people, can, also, play, pair, of, flutes, jodiyo, pavo, simultaneously, in, china, there, are, many, varieties, of, dizi, or, chinese, flute, with, different, sizes, structures, with, or, without, a, resonance, membrane, and, number, of, holes, from, 6, to, 11, and, intonations, different, keys, most, are, made, of, bamboo, but, can, come, in, wood, jade, bone, and, iron, one, peculiar, feature, of, the, chinese, flute, is, the, use, of, a, resonance, membrane, mounted, on, one, of, the, holes, that, vibrates, with, the, air, column, inside, the, tube, this, membrane, is, called, a, di, mo, which, is, usually, a, thin, tissue, paper, it, gives, the, flute, a, bright, sound, commonly, seen, flutes, in, the, modern, chinese, orchestra, are, the, bangdi, qudi, xindi, and, dadi, the, bamboo, flute, played, vertically, is, called, the, xiao, which, is, a, different, category, of, wind, instrument, in, china, the, korean, flute, called, the, daegeum, is, a, large, bamboo, transverse, flute, used, in, traditional, korean, music, it, has, a, buzzing, membrane, that, gives, it, a, unique, timbre, the, japanese, flute, called, the, fue, hiragana, encompasses, a, large, number, of, musical, flutes, from, japan, include, the, end, blown, shakuhachi, and, hotchiku, as, well, as, the, transverse, gakubue, komabue, ry, teki, n, kan, shinobue, kagurabue, and, minteki, the, sodina, is, an, end, blown, flute, found, throughout, the, island, state, of, madagascar, located, in, the, indian, ocean, off, southeastern, africa, one, of, the, oldest, instruments, on, the, island, it, bears, close, resemblance, to, end, blown, flutes, found, in, southeast, asia, and, particularly, indonesia, where, it, is, known, as, the, suling, suggesting, the, predecessor, to, the, sodina, was, carried, to, madagascar, in, outrigger, canoes, by, the, island, s, original, settlers, emigrating, from, borneo, an, image, of, the, most, celebrated, contemporary, sodina, flutist, rakoto, frah, d, 2001, was, featured, on, the, local, currency, the, sring, also, called, blul, is, a, relatively, small, end, blown, flute, with, a, nasal, tone, quality, found, in, the, caucasus, region, of, eastern, armenia, it, is, made, of, wood, or, cane, usually, with, seven, finger, holes, and, one, thumb, hole, producing, a, diatonic, scale, one, armenian, musicologist, believes, the, sring, to, be, the, most, characteristic, of, national, armenian, instruments, the, j, is, a, traditional, musical, instrument, utilized, by, the, igbo, people, who, are, indigenous, to, nigeria, the, j, flute, is, used, during, cultural, activities, or, events, where, igbo, music, is, played, it, is, skillfully, carved, from, wood, bamboo, or, metal, and, is, played, by, blowing, air, into, one, end, while, covering, and, uncovering, holes, along, the, body, to, create, different, notes, there, are, several, means, by, which, flautists, breathe, to, blow, air, through, the, instrument, and, produce, sound, they, include, diaphragmatic, breathing, and, circular, breathing, diaphragmatic, breathing, optimizes, inhalation, minimizing, the, number, of, breaths, circular, breathing, brings, air, in, through, the, nose, and, out, through, the, mouth, enabling, a, continuous, sound
