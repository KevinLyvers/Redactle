origami, japanese, pronunciation, or, from, ori, meaning, folding, and, kami, meaning, paper, kami, changes, to, gami, due, to, rendaku, is, the, japanese, art, of, paper, folding, in, modern, usage, the, word, origami, is, often, used, as, an, inclusive, term, for, all, folding, practices, regardless, of, their, culture, of, origin, the, goal, is, to, transform, a, flat, square, sheet, of, paper, into, a, finished, sculpture, through, folding, and, sculpting, techniques, modern, origami, practitioners, generally, discourage, the, use, of, cuts, glue, or, markings, on, the, paper, origami, folders, often, use, the, japanese, word, kirigami, to, refer, to, designs, which, use, cuts, in, the, detailed, japanese, classification, origami, is, divided, into, stylized, ceremonial, origami, girei, origami, and, recreational, origami, y, gi, origami, and, only, recreational, origami, is, generally, recognized, as, origami, in, japan, ceremonial, origami, is, generally, called, origata, ja, to, distinguish, it, from, recreational, origami, the, term, origata, is, one, of, the, old, terms, for, origami, the, small, number, of, basic, origami, folds, can, be, combined, in, a, variety, of, ways, to, make, intricate, designs, the, best, known, origami, model, is, the, japanese, paper, crane, in, general, these, designs, begin, with, a, square, sheet, of, paper, whose, sides, may, be, of, different, colors, prints, or, patterns, traditional, japanese, origami, which, has, been, practiced, since, the, edo, period, 1603, 1868, has, often, been, less, strict, about, these, conventions, sometimes, cutting, the, paper, or, using, nonsquare, shapes, to, start, with, the, principles, of, origami, are, also, used, in, stents, packaging, and, other, engineering, applications, the, japanese, word, origami, itself, is, a, compound, of, two, smaller, japanese, words, ori, root, verb, oru, meaning, to, fold, and, kami, meaning, paper, until, recently, not, all, forms, of, paper, folding, were, grouped, under, the, word, origami, before, that, paper, folding, for, play, was, known, by, a, variety, of, names, including, orikata, or, origata, orisue, orimono, tatamigami, and, others, distinct, paperfolding, traditions, arose, in, europe, china, and, japan, which, have, been, well, documented, by, historians, these, seem, to, have, been, mostly, separate, traditions, until, the, 20th, century, by, the, 7th, century, paper, had, been, introduced, to, japan, from, china, via, the, korean, peninsula, and, the, japanese, developed, washi, by, improving, the, method, of, making, paper, in, the, heian, period, the, paper, making, technique, developed, in, japan, around, 805, to, 809, was, called, nagashi, suki, a, method, of, adding, mucilage, to, the, process, of, the, conventional, tame, suki, technique, to, form, a, stronger, layer, of, paper, fibers, with, the, development, of, japanese, paper, making, technology, and, the, widespread, use, of, paper, folded, paper, began, to, be, used, for, decorations, and, tools, for, religious, ceremonies, such, as, gohei, nusa, ja, and, shide, at, shinto, shrines, religious, decorations, made, of, paper, and, the, way, gifts, were, wrapped, in, folded, paper, gradually, became, stylized, and, established, as, ceremonial, origami, during, the, heian, period, the, imperial, court, established, a, code, of, etiquette, for, wrapping, money, and, goods, used, in, ceremonies, with, folded, paper, and, a, code, of, etiquette, for, wrapping, gifts, in, the, muromachi, period, from, the, 1300s, to, the, 1400s, various, forms, of, decorum, were, developed, by, the, ogasawara, clan, and, ise, clans, ja, completing, the, prototype, of, japanese, folded, paper, decorum, that, continues, to, this, day, the, ise, clan, presided, over, the, decorum, of, the, inside, of, the, palace, of, the, ashikaga, shogunate, and, in, particular, ise, sadachika, ja, during, the, reign, of, the, eighth, shogun, ashikaga, yoshimasa, greatly, influenced, the, development, of, the, decorum, of, the, daimyo, and, samurai, classes, leading, to, the, development, of, various, stylized, forms, of, ceremonial, origami, the, shapes, of, ceremonial, origami, created, in, this, period, were, geometric, and, the, shapes, of, noshi, to, be, attached, to, gifts, at, feasts, and, weddings, and, origami, that, imitated, butterflies, to, be, displayed, on, sake, vessels, were, quite, different, from, those, of, later, generations, of, recreational, origami, whose, shapes, captured, the, characteristics, of, real, objects, and, living, things, the, noshi, wrapping, and, the, folding, of, female, and, male, butterflies, which, are, still, used, for, weddings, and, celebrations, are, a, continuation, and, development, of, a, tradition, that, began, in, the, muromachi, period, a, reference, in, a, poem, by, ihara, saikaku, from, 1680, describes, the, origami, butterflies, used, during, shinto, weddings, to, represent, the, bride, and, groom, it, is, not, certain, when, play, made, paper, models, now, commonly, known, as, origami, began, in, japan, however, the, kozuka, of, a, japanese, sword, made, by, got, eij, between, the, end, of, the, 1500s, and, the, beginning, of, the, 1600s, was, decorated, with, a, picture, of, a, crane, made, of, origami, and, it, is, believed, that, origami, for, play, existed, by, the, sengoku, period, or, the, early, edo, period, in, 1747, during, the, edo, period, a, book, titled, ranma, zushiki, was, published, which, contained, various, designs, of, the, ranma, ja, a, decoration, of, japanese, architecture, this, included, origami, of, various, designs, including, paper, models, of, cranes, which, are, still, well, known, today, and, it, is, thought, that, by, this, time, many, people, were, familiar, with, origami, for, play, which, modern, people, recognize, as, origami, during, this, period, origami, was, commonly, called, orikata, or, orisue, and, was, often, used, as, a, pattern, on, kimonos, and, decorations, hiden, senbazuru, orikata, ja, published, in, 1797, is, the, oldest, known, technical, book, on, origami, for, play, the, book, contains, 49, origami, pieces, created, by, a, buddhist, monk, named, gid, ja, in, ise, province, whose, works, were, named, and, accompanied, by, ky, ka, comic, tanka, by, author, akisato, rit, these, pieces, were, far, more, technically, advanced, than, their, predecessors, suggesting, that, origami, culture, had, become, more, sophisticated, gido, continued, to, produce, origami, after, the, publication, of, his, book, leaving, at, least, 158, highly, skilled, masterpieces, for, posterity, in, 1976, kuwana, city, in, mie, prefecture, gido, s, hometown, designated, 49, of, the, methods, described, in, the, hiden, senbazuru, orikata, as, intangible, cultural, properties, of, kuwana, city, kuwana, city, has, also, certified, as, qualified, persons, who, are, able, to, correctly, produce, these, works, and, have, in, depth, knowledge, of, the, art, kuwana, city, has, published, some, of, the, origami, production, methods, on, youtube, from, the, late, edo, period, to, the, bakumatu, period, origami, that, imitated, the, six, legendary, japanese, poets, rokkasen, listed, in, the, kokin, wakash, compiled, in, the, 900s, and, the, characters, in, ch, shingura, became, popular, but, today, they, are, rarely, used, as, subjects, for, origami, in, europe, there, was, a, well, developed, genre, of, napkin, folding, which, flourished, during, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, after, this, period, this, genre, declined, and, was, mostly, forgotten, historian, joan, sallas, attributes, this, to, the, introduction, of, porcelain, which, replaced, complex, napkin, folds, as, a, dinner, table, status, symbol, among, nobility, however, some, of, the, techniques, and, bases, associated, with, this, tradition, continued, to, be, a, part, of, european, culture, folding, was, a, significant, part, of, friedrich, fr, bel, s, kindergarten, method, and, the, designs, published, in, connection, with, his, curriculum, are, stylistically, similar, to, the, napkin, fold, repertoire, another, example, of, early, origami, in, europe, is, the, pajarita, a, stylized, bird, whose, origins, date, from, at, least, the, nineteenth, century, when, japan, opened, its, borders, in, the, 1860s, as, part, of, a, modernization, strategy, they, imported, fr, bel, s, kindergarten, system, and, with, it, german, ideas, about, paperfolding, this, included, the, ban, on, cuts, and, the, starting, shape, of, a, bicolored, square, these, ideas, and, some, of, the, european, folding, repertoire, were, integrated, into, the, japanese, tradition, before, this, traditional, japanese, sources, use, a, variety, of, starting, shapes, often, had, cuts, and, if, they, had, color, or, markings, these, were, added, after, the, model, was, folded, in, japan, the, first, kindergarten, was, established, in, 1875, and, origami, was, promoted, as, part, of, early, childhood, education, the, kindergarten, s, 1877, regulations, listed, 25, activities, including, origami, subjects, sh, kokumin, a, magazine, for, boys, frequently, published, articles, on, origami, origami, zusetsu, published, in, 1908, clearly, distinguished, ceremonial, origami, from, recreational, origami, these, books, and, magazines, carried, both, the, traditional, japanese, style, of, origami, and, the, style, inspired, by, fr, bel, in, the, early, 1900s, akira, yoshizawa, kosho, uchiyama, and, others, began, creating, and, recording, original, origami, works, akira, yoshizawa, in, particular, was, responsible, for, a, number, of, innovations, such, as, wet, folding, and, the, yoshizawa, randlett, diagramming, system, and, his, work, inspired, a, renaissance, of, the, art, form, during, the, 1980s, a, number, of, folders, started, systematically, studying, the, mathematical, properties, of, folded, forms, which, led, to, a, rapid, increase, in, the, complexity, of, origami, models, starting, in, the, late, 20th, century, there, has, been, a, renewed, interest, in, understanding, the, behavior, of, folding, matter, both, artistically, and, scientifically, the, new, origami, which, distinguishes, it, from, old, craft, practices, has, had, a, rapid, evolution, due, to, the, contribution, of, computational, mathematics, and, the, development, of, techniques, such, as, box, pleating, tessellations, and, wet, folding, artists, like, robert, j, lang, erik, demaine, sipho, mabona, giang, dinh, paul, jackson, and, others, are, frequently, cited, for, advancing, new, applications, of, the, art, the, computational, facet, and, the, interchanges, through, social, networks, where, new, techniques, and, designs, are, introduced, have, raised, the, profile, of, origami, in, the, 21st, century, many, origami, books, begin, with, a, description, of, basic, origami, techniques, which, are, used, to, construct, the, models, this, includes, simple, diagrams, of, basic, folds, like, valley, and, mountain, folds, pleats, reverse, folds, squash, folds, and, sinks, there, are, also, standard, named, bases, which, are, used, in, a, wide, variety, of, models, for, instance, the, bird, base, is, an, intermediate, stage, in, the, construction, of, the, flapping, bird, additional, bases, are, the, preliminary, base, square, base, fish, base, waterbomb, base, and, the, frog, base, almost, any, laminar, flat, material, can, be, used, for, folding, the, only, requirement, is, that, it, should, hold, a, crease, origami, paper, often, referred, to, as, kami, japanese, for, paper, is, sold, in, prepackaged, squares, of, various, sizes, ranging, from, 2, 5, cm, 1, in, to, 25, cm, 10, in, or, more, it, is, commonly, colored, on, one, side, and, white, on, the, other, however, dual, coloured, and, patterned, versions, exist, and, can, be, used, effectively, for, color, changed, models, origami, paper, weighs, slightly, less, than, copy, paper, making, it, suitable, for, a, wider, range, of, models, normal, copy, paper, with, weights, of, 70, 90, g, m, 2, 19, 24, lb, can, be, used, for, simple, folds, such, as, the, crane, and, waterbomb, heavier, weight, papers, of, 100, g, m, 2, approx, 25, lb, or, more, can, be, wet, folded, this, technique, allows, for, a, more, rounded, sculpting, of, the, model, which, becomes, rigid, and, sturdy, when, it, is, dry, foil, backed, paper, as, its, name, implies, is, a, sheet, of, thin, foil, glued, to, a, sheet, of, thin, paper, related, to, this, is, tissue, foil, which, is, made, by, gluing, a, thin, piece, of, tissue, paper, to, kitchen, aluminium, foil, a, second, piece, of, tissue, can, be, glued, onto, the, reverse, side, to, produce, a, tissue, foil, tissue, sandwich, foil, backed, paper, is, available, commercially, but, not, tissue, foil, it, must, be, handmade, both, types, of, foil, materials, are, suitable, for, complex, models, washi, is, the, traditional, origami, paper, used, in, japan, washi, is, generally, tougher, than, ordinary, paper, made, from, wood, pulp, and, is, used, in, many, traditional, arts, washi, is, commonly, made, using, fibres, from, the, bark, of, the, gampi, tree, the, mitsumata, shrub, edgeworthia, papyrifera, or, the, paper, mulberry, but, can, also, be, made, using, bamboo, hemp, rice, and, wheat, artisan, papers, such, as, unryu, lokta, hanji, gampi, kozo, saa, and, abaca, have, long, fibers, and, are, often, extremely, strong, as, these, papers, are, floppy, to, start, with, they, are, often, backcoated, or, resized, with, methylcellulose, or, wheat, paste, before, folding, also, these, papers, are, extremely, thin, and, compressible, allowing, for, thin, narrowed, limbs, as, in, the, case, of, insect, models, paper, money, from, various, countries, is, also, popular, to, create, origami, with, this, is, known, variously, as, dollar, origami, orikane, and, money, origami, it, is, common, to, fold, using, a, flat, surface, but, some, folders, like, doing, it, in, the, air, with, no, tools, especially, when, displaying, the, folding, some, folders, believe, that, no, tool, should, be, used, when, folding, however, a, couple, of, tools, can, help, especially, with, the, more, complex, models, for, instance, a, bone, folder, allows, sharp, creases, to, be, made, in, the, paper, easily, paper, clips, can, act, as, extra, pairs, of, fingers, and, tweezers, can, be, used, to, make, small, folds, when, making, complex, models, from, origami, crease, patterns, it, can, help, to, use, a, ruler, and, ballpoint, embosser, to, score, the, creases, completed, models, can, be, sprayed, so, that, they, keep, their, shape, better, and, a, spray, is, needed, when, wet, folding, in, addition, to, the, more, common, still, life, origami, there, are, also, moving, object, designs, origami, can, move, action, origami, includes, origami, that, flies, requires, inflation, to, complete, or, when, complete, uses, the, kinetic, energy, of, a, person, s, hands, applied, at, a, certain, region, on, the, model, to, move, another, flap, or, limb, some, argue, that, strictly, speaking, only, the, latter, is, really, recognized, as, action, origami, action, origami, first, appearing, with, the, traditional, japanese, flapping, bird, is, quite, common, one, example, is, robert, lang, s, instrumentalists, when, the, figures, heads, are, pulled, away, from, their, bodies, their, hands, will, move, resembling, the, playing, of, music, modular, origami, consists, of, putting, a, number, of, identical, pieces, together, to, form, a, complete, model, often, the, individual, pieces, are, simple, but, the, final, assembly, may, be, more, difficult, many, modular, origami, models, are, decorative, folding, balls, such, as, kusudama, which, differ, from, classical, origami, in, that, the, pieces, may, be, held, together, using, thread, or, glue, chinese, paper, folding, a, cousin, of, origami, includes, a, similar, style, called, golden, venture, folding, where, large, numbers, of, pieces, are, put, together, to, create, elaborate, models, this, style, is, most, commonly, known, as, 3d, origami, however, that, name, did, not, appear, until, joie, staff, published, a, series, of, books, titled, 3d, origami, more, 3d, origami, and, more, and, more, 3d, origami, this, style, originated, from, some, chinese, refugees, while, they, were, detained, in, america, and, is, also, called, golden, venture, folding, from, the, ship, they, came, on, wet, folding, is, an, origami, technique, for, producing, models, with, gentle, curves, rather, than, geometric, straight, folds, and, flat, surfaces, the, paper, is, dampened, so, it, can, be, moulded, easily, the, final, model, keeps, its, shape, when, it, dries, it, can, be, used, for, instance, to, produce, very, natural, looking, animal, models, size, an, adhesive, that, is, crisp, and, hard, when, dry, but, dissolves, in, water, when, wet, and, becoming, soft, and, flexible, is, often, applied, to, the, paper, either, at, the, pulp, stage, while, the, paper, is, being, formed, or, on, the, surface, of, a, ready, sheet, of, paper, the, latter, method, is, called, external, sizing, and, most, commonly, uses, methylcellulose, or, mc, paste, or, various, plant, starches, pureland, origami, adds, the, restrictions, that, only, simple, mountain, valley, folds, may, be, used, and, all, folds, must, have, straightforward, locations, it, was, developed, by, john, smith, in, the, 1970s, to, help, inexperienced, folders, or, those, with, limited, motor, skills, some, designers, also, like, the, challenge, of, creating, within, the, very, strict, constraints, origami, tessellation, is, a, branch, that, has, grown, in, popularity, after, 2000, a, tessellation, is, a, collection, of, figures, filling, a, plane, with, no, gaps, or, overlaps, in, origami, tessellations, pleats, are, used, to, connect, molecules, such, as, twist, folds, together, in, a, repeating, fashion, during, the, 1960s, shuzo, fujimoto, was, the, first, to, explore, twist, fold, tessellations, in, any, systematic, way, coming, up, with, dozens, of, patterns, and, establishing, the, genre, in, the, origami, mainstream, around, the, same, time, period, ron, resch, patented, some, tessellation, patterns, as, part, of, his, explorations, into, kinetic, sculpture, and, developable, surfaces, although, his, work, was, not, known, by, the, origami, community, until, the, 1980s, chris, palmer, is, an, artist, who, has, extensively, explored, tessellations, after, seeing, the, zilij, patterns, in, the, alhambra, and, has, found, ways, to, create, detailed, origami, tessellations, out, of, silk, robert, lang, and, alex, bateman, are, two, designers, who, use, computer, programs, to, create, origami, tessellations, the, first, international, convention, devoted, to, origami, tessellations, was, hosted, in, bras, lia, brazil, in, 2006, and, the, first, instruction, book, on, tessellation, folding, patterns, was, published, by, eric, gjerde, in, 2008, since, then, the, field, has, grown, very, quickly, tessellation, artists, include, polly, verity, scotland, joel, cooper, christine, edison, ray, schamp, and, goran, konjevod, from, the, us, roberto, gretter, italy, christiane, bettens, switzerland, carlos, natan, l, pez, mexico, and, jorge, c, lucero, brazil, kirigami, is, a, japanese, term, for, paper, cutting, cutting, was, often, used, in, traditional, japanese, origami, but, modern, innovations, in, technique, have, made, the, use, of, cuts, unnecessary, most, origami, designers, no, longer, consider, models, with, cuts, to, be, origami, instead, using, the, term, kirigami, to, describe, them, this, change, in, attitude, occurred, during, the, 1960s, and, 70s, so, early, origami, books, often, use, cuts, but, for, the, most, part, they, have, disappeared, from, the, modern, origami, repertoire, and, most, modern, books, do, not, even, mention, cutting, strip, folding, is, a, combination, of, paper, folding, and, paper, weaving, a, common, example, of, strip, folding, is, called, the, lucky, star, also, called, chinese, lucky, star, dream, star, wishing, star, or, simply, origami, star, another, common, fold, is, the, moravian, star, which, is, made, by, strip, folding, in, 3, dimensional, design, to, include, 16, spikes, teabag, folding, is, credited, to, dutch, artist, tiny, van, der, plas, who, developed, the, technique, in, 1992, as, a, papercraft, art, for, embellishing, greeting, cards, it, uses, small, square, pieces, of, paper, e, g, a, tea, bag, wrapper, bearing, symmetrical, designs, that, are, folded, in, such, a, way, that, they, interlock, and, produce, a, three, dimensional, version, of, the, underlying, design, the, basic, kite, fold, is, used, to, produce, rosettes, that, are, a, 3, dimensional, version, of, the, 2d, design, the, basic, rosette, design, requires, eight, matching, squares, to, be, folded, into, the, kite, design, mathematics, teachers, find, the, designs, very, useful, as, a, practical, way, of, demonstrating, some, basic, properties, of, symmetry, the, practice, and, study, of, origami, encapsulates, several, subjects, of, mathematical, interest, for, instance, the, problem, of, flat, foldability, whether, a, crease, pattern, can, be, folded, into, a, 2, dimensional, model, has, been, a, topic, of, considerable, mathematical, study, a, number, of, technological, advances, have, come, from, insights, obtained, through, paper, folding, for, example, techniques, have, been, developed, for, the, deployment, of, car, airbags, and, stent, implants, from, a, folded, position, the, problem, of, rigid, origami, if, we, replaced, the, paper, with, sheet, metal, and, had, hinges, in, place, of, the, crease, lines, could, we, still, fold, the, model, has, great, practical, importance, for, example, the, miura, map, fold, is, a, rigid, fold, that, has, been, used, to, deploy, large, solar, panel, arrays, for, space, satellites, origami, can, be, used, to, construct, various, geometrical, designs, not, possible, with, compass, and, straightedge, constructions, for, instance, paper, folding, may, be, used, for, angle, trisection, and, doubling, the, cube, technical, origami, known, in, japanese, as, origami, sekkei, is, an, origami, design, approach, in, which, the, model, is, conceived, as, an, engineered, crease, pattern, rather, than, developed, through, trial, and, error, with, advances, in, origami, mathematics, the, basic, structure, of, a, new, origami, model, can, be, theoretically, plotted, out, on, paper, before, any, actual, folding, even, occurs, this, method, of, origami, design, was, developed, by, robert, lang, meguro, toshiyuki, and, others, and, allows, for, the, creation, of, extremely, complex, multi, limbed, models, such, as, many, legged, centipedes, human, figures, with, a, full, complement, of, fingers, and, toes, and, the, like, the, crease, pattern, is, a, layout, of, the, creases, required, to, form, the, structure, of, the, model, paradoxically, enough, when, origami, designers, come, up, with, a, crease, pattern, for, a, new, design, the, majority, of, the, smaller, creases, are, relatively, unimportant, and, added, only, towards, the, completion, of, the, model, what, is, more, important, is, the, allocation, of, regions, of, the, paper, and, how, these, are, mapped, to, the, structure, of, the, object, being, designed, by, opening, up, a, folded, model, you, can, observe, the, structures, that, comprise, it, the, study, of, these, structures, led, to, a, number, of, crease, pattern, oriented, design, approaches, the, pattern, of, allocations, is, referred, to, as, the, circle, packing, or, polygon, packing, using, optimization, algorithms, a, circle, packing, figure, can, be, computed, for, any, uniaxial, base, of, arbitrary, complexity, once, this, figure, is, computed, the, creases, which, are, then, used, to, obtain, the, base, structure, can, be, added, this, is, not, a, unique, mathematical, process, hence, it, is, possible, for, two, designs, to, have, the, same, circle, packing, and, yet, different, crease, pattern, structures, as, a, circle, encloses, the, maximum, amount, of, area, for, a, given, perimeter, circle, packing, allows, for, maximum, efficiency, in, terms, of, paper, usage, however, other, polygonal, shapes, can, be, used, to, solve, the, packing, problem, as, well, the, use, of, polygonal, shapes, other, than, circles, is, often, motivated, by, the, desire, to, find, easily, locatable, creases, such, as, multiples, of, 22, 5, degrees, and, hence, an, easier, folding, sequence, as, well, one, popular, offshoot, of, the, circle, packing, method, is, box, pleating, where, squares, are, used, instead, of, circles, as, a, result, the, crease, pattern, that, arises, from, this, method, contains, only, 45, and, 90, degree, angles, which, often, makes, for, a, more, direct, folding, sequence, a, number, of, computer, aids, to, origami, such, as, treemaker, and, oripa, have, been, devised, treemaker, allows, new, origami, bases, to, be, designed, for, special, purposes, and, oripa, tries, to, calculate, the, folded, shape, from, the, crease, pattern, copyright, in, origami, designs, and, the, use, of, models, has, become, an, increasingly, important, issue, in, the, origami, community, as, the, internet, has, made, the, sale, and, distribution, of, pirated, designs, very, easy, it, is, considered, good, etiquette, to, always, credit, the, original, artist, and, the, folder, when, displaying, origami, models, it, has, been, claimed, that, all, commercial, rights, to, designs, and, models, are, typically, reserved, by, origami, artists, however, the, degree, to, which, this, can, be, enforced, has, been, disputed, under, such, a, view, a, person, who, folds, a, model, using, a, legally, obtained, design, could, publicly,
