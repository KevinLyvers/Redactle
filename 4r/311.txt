in, music, theory, a, scale, is, any, consecutive, series, of, notes, that, form, a, progression, between, one, note, and, its, octave, typically, by, order, of, pitch, or, fundamental, frequency, the, word, scale, originates, from, the, latin, scala, which, literally, means, ladder, therefore, any, scale, is, distinguishable, by, its, step, pattern, or, how, its, intervals, interact, with, each, other, often, especially, in, the, context, of, the, common, practice, period, most, or, all, of, the, melody, and, harmony, of, a, musical, work, is, built, using, the, notes, of, a, single, scale, which, can, be, conveniently, represented, on, a, staff, with, a, standard, key, signature, due, to, the, principle, of, octave, equivalence, scales, are, generally, considered, to, span, a, single, octave, with, higher, or, lower, octaves, simply, repeating, the, pattern, a, musical, scale, represents, a, division, of, the, octave, space, into, a, certain, number, of, scale, steps, a, scale, step, being, the, recognizable, distance, or, interval, between, two, successive, notes, of, the, scale, however, there, is, no, need, for, scale, steps, to, be, equal, within, any, scale, and, particularly, as, demonstrated, by, microtonal, music, there, is, no, limit, to, how, many, notes, can, be, injected, within, any, given, musical, interval, a, measure, of, the, width, of, each, scale, step, provides, a, method, to, classify, scales, for, instance, in, a, chromatic, scale, each, scale, step, represents, a, semitone, interval, while, a, major, scale, is, defined, by, the, interval, pattern, w, w, h, w, w, w, h, where, w, stands, for, whole, step, an, interval, spanning, two, semitones, e, g, from, c, to, d, and, h, stands, for, half, step, e, g, from, c, to, d, based, on, their, interval, patterns, scales, are, put, into, categories, including, pentatonic, diatonic, chromatic, major, minor, and, others, a, specific, scale, is, defined, by, its, characteristic, interval, pattern, and, by, a, special, note, known, as, its, first, degree, or, tonic, the, tonic, of, a, scale, is, the, note, selected, as, the, beginning, of, the, octave, and, therefore, as, the, beginning, of, the, adopted, interval, pattern, typically, the, name, of, the, scale, specifies, both, its, tonic, and, its, interval, pattern, for, example, c, major, indicates, a, major, scale, with, a, c, tonic, scales, are, typically, listed, from, low, to, high, pitch, most, scales, are, octave, repeating, meaning, their, pattern, of, notes, is, the, same, in, every, octave, the, bohlen, pierce, scale, is, one, exception, an, octave, repeating, scale, can, be, represented, as, a, circular, arrangement, of, pitch, classes, ordered, by, increasing, or, decreasing, pitch, class, for, instance, the, increasing, c, major, scale, is, c, d, e, f, g, a, b, with, the, bracket, indicating, that, the, last, note, is, an, octave, higher, than, the, first, note, and, the, decreasing, c, major, scale, is, c, b, a, g, f, e, d, with, the, bracket, indicating, an, octave, lower, than, the, first, note, in, the, scale, the, distance, between, two, successive, notes, in, a, scale, is, called, a, scale, step, the, notes, of, a, scale, are, numbered, by, their, steps, from, the, first, degree, of, the, scale, for, example, in, a, c, major, scale, the, first, note, is, c, the, second, d, the, third, e, and, so, on, two, notes, can, also, be, numbered, in, relation, to, each, other, c, and, e, create, an, interval, of, a, third, in, this, case, a, major, third, d, and, f, also, create, a, third, in, this, case, a, minor, third, a, single, scale, can, be, manifested, at, many, different, pitch, levels, for, example, a, c, major, scale, can, be, started, at, c4, middle, c, see, scientific, pitch, notation, and, ascending, an, octave, to, c5, or, it, could, be, started, at, c6, ascending, an, octave, to, c7, scales, may, be, described, according, to, the, number, of, different, pitch, classes, they, contain, scales, may, also, be, described, by, their, constituent, intervals, such, as, being, hemitonic, cohemitonic, or, having, imperfections, many, music, theorists, concur, that, the, constituent, intervals, of, a, scale, have, a, large, role, in, the, cognitive, perception, of, its, sonority, or, tonal, character, the, number, of, the, notes, that, make, up, a, scale, as, well, as, the, quality, of, the, intervals, between, successive, notes, of, the, scale, help, to, give, the, music, of, a, culture, area, its, peculiar, sound, quality, the, pitch, distances, or, intervals, among, the, notes, of, a, scale, tell, us, more, about, the, sound, of, the, music, than, does, the, mere, number, of, tones, scales, may, also, be, described, by, their, symmetry, such, as, being, palindromic, chiral, or, having, rotational, symmetry, as, in, messiaen, s, modes, of, limited, transposition, the, notes, of, a, scale, form, intervals, with, each, of, the, other, notes, of, the, chord, in, combination, a, 5, note, scale, has, 10, of, these, harmonic, intervals, a, 6, note, scale, has, 15, a, 7, note, scale, has, 21, an, 8, note, scale, has, 28, though, the, scale, is, not, a, chord, and, might, never, be, heard, more, than, one, note, at, a, time, still, the, absence, presence, and, placement, of, certain, key, intervals, plays, a, large, part, in, the, sound, of, the, scale, the, natural, movement, of, melody, within, the, scale, and, the, selection, of, chords, taken, naturally, from, the, scale, a, musical, scale, that, contains, tritones, is, called, tritonic, though, the, expression, is, also, used, for, any, scale, with, just, three, notes, per, octave, whether, or, not, it, includes, a, tritone, and, one, without, tritones, is, atritonic, a, scale, or, chord, that, contains, semitones, is, called, hemitonic, and, without, semitones, is, anhemitonic, scales, can, be, abstracted, from, performance, or, composition, they, are, also, often, used, precompositionally, to, guide, or, limit, a, composition, explicit, instruction, in, scales, has, been, part, of, compositional, training, for, many, centuries, one, or, more, scales, may, be, used, in, a, composition, such, as, in, claude, debussy, s, l, isle, joyeuse, to, the, right, the, first, scale, is, a, whole, tone, scale, while, the, second, and, third, scales, are, diatonic, scales, all, three, are, used, in, the, opening, pages, of, debussy, s, piece, scales, in, traditional, western, music, generally, consist, of, seven, notes, and, repeat, at, the, octave, notes, in, the, commonly, used, scales, see, just, below, are, separated, by, whole, and, half, step, intervals, of, tones, and, semitones, the, harmonic, minor, scale, includes, a, three, semitone, step, the, anhemitonic, pentatonic, includes, two, of, those, and, no, semitones, western, music, in, the, medieval, and, renaissance, periods, 1100, 1600, tends, to, use, the, white, note, diatonic, scale, c, d, e, f, g, a, b, accidentals, are, rare, and, somewhat, unsystematically, used, often, to, avoid, the, tritone, music, of, the, common, practice, periods, 1600, 1900, uses, three, types, of, scale, these, scales, are, used, in, all, of, their, transpositions, the, music, of, this, period, introduces, modulation, which, involves, systematic, changes, from, one, scale, to, another, modulation, occurs, in, relatively, conventionalized, ways, for, example, major, mode, pieces, typically, begin, in, a, tonic, diatonic, scale, and, modulate, to, the, dominant, scale, a, fifth, above, in, the, 19th, century, to, a, certain, extent, but, more, in, the, 20th, century, additional, types, of, scales, were, explored, a, large, variety, of, other, scales, exists, some, of, the, more, common, being, scales, such, as, the, pentatonic, scale, may, be, considered, gapped, relative, to, the, diatonic, scale, an, auxiliary, scale, is, a, scale, other, than, the, primary, or, original, scale, see, modulation, music, and, auxiliary, diminished, scale, in, many, musical, circumstances, a, specific, note, of, the, scale, is, chosen, as, the, tonic, the, central, and, most, stable, note, of, the, scale, in, western, tonal, music, simple, songs, or, pieces, typically, start, and, end, on, the, tonic, note, relative, to, a, choice, of, a, certain, tonic, the, notes, of, a, scale, are, often, labeled, with, numbers, recording, how, many, scale, steps, above, the, tonic, they, are, for, example, the, notes, of, the, c, major, scale, c, d, e, f, g, a, b, can, be, labeled, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, reflecting, the, choice, of, c, as, tonic, the, expression, scale, degree, refers, to, these, numerical, labels, such, labeling, requires, the, choice, of, a, first, note, hence, scale, degree, labels, are, not, intrinsic, to, the, scale, itself, but, rather, to, its, modes, for, example, if, we, choose, a, as, tonic, then, we, can, label, the, notes, of, the, c, major, scale, using, a, 1, b, 2, c, 3, and, so, on, when, we, do, so, we, create, a, new, scale, called, the, a, minor, scale, see, the, musical, note, article, for, how, the, notes, are, customarily, named, in, different, countries, the, scale, degrees, of, a, heptatonic, 7, note, scale, can, also, be, named, using, the, terms, tonic, supertonic, mediant, subdominant, dominant, submediant, subtonic, if, the, subtonic, is, a, semitone, away, from, the, tonic, then, it, is, usually, called, the, leading, tone, or, leading, note, otherwise, the, leading, tone, refers, to, the, raised, subtonic, also, commonly, used, is, the, movable, do, solf, ge, naming, convention, in, which, each, scale, degree, is, denoted, by, a, syllable, in, the, major, scale, the, solf, ge, syllables, are, do, re, mi, fa, so, or, sol, la, ti, or, si, do, or, ut, in, naming, the, notes, of, a, scale, it, is, customary, that, each, scale, degree, be, assigned, its, own, letter, name, for, example, the, a, major, scale, is, written, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, rather, than, a, b, d, d, e, e, g, however, it, is, impossible, to, do, this, in, scales, that, contain, more, than, seven, notes, at, least, in, the, english, language, nomenclature, system, scales, may, also, be, identified, by, using, a, binary, system, of, twelve, zeros, or, ones, to, represent, each, of, the, twelve, notes, of, a, chromatic, scale, the, most, common, binary, numbering, scheme, defines, lower, pitches, to, have, lower, numeric, value, as, opposed, to, low, pitches, having, a, high, numeric, value, thus, a, single, pitch, class, n, in, the, pitch, class, set, is, represented, by, 2, n, this, maps, the, entire, power, set, of, all, pitch, class, sets, in, 12, tet, to, the, numbers, 0, to, 4095, the, binary, digits, read, as, ascending, pitches, from, right, to, left, which, some, find, discombobulating, because, they, are, used, to, low, to, high, reading, left, to, right, as, on, a, piano, keyboard, in, this, scheme, the, major, scale, is, 101010110101, 2741, this, binary, representation, permits, easy, calculation, of, interval, vectors, and, common, tones, using, logical, binary, operators, it, also, provides, a, perfect, index, for, every, possible, combination, of, tones, as, every, scale, has, its, own, number, scales, may, also, be, shown, as, semitones, from, the, tonic, for, instance, 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, denotes, any, major, scale, such, as, c, d, e, f, g, a, b, in, which, the, first, degree, is, obviously, 0, semitones, from, the, tonic, and, therefore, coincides, with, it, the, second, is, 2, semitones, from, the, tonic, the, third, is, 4, semitones, from, the, tonic, and, so, on, again, this, implies, that, the, notes, are, drawn, from, a, chromatic, scale, tuned, with, 12, tone, equal, temperament, for, some, fretted, string, instruments, such, as, the, guitar, and, the, bass, guitar, scales, can, be, notated, in, tabulature, an, approach, which, indicates, the, fret, number, and, string, upon, which, each, scale, degree, is, played, composers, transform, musical, patterns, by, moving, every, note, in, the, pattern, by, a, constant, number, of, scale, steps, thus, in, the, c, major, scale, the, pattern, c, d, e, might, be, shifted, up, or, transposed, a, single, scale, step, to, become, d, e, f, this, process, is, called, scalar, transposition, or, shifting, to, a, new, key, and, can, often, be, found, in, musical, sequences, and, patterns, it, is, d, e, f, in, chromatic, transposition, since, the, steps, of, a, scale, can, have, various, sizes, this, process, introduces, subtle, melodic, and, harmonic, variation, into, the, music, in, western, tonal, music, the, simplest, and, most, common, type, of, modulation, or, changing, keys, is, to, shift, from, one, major, key, to, another, key, built, on, the, first, key, s, fifth, or, dominant, scale, degree, in, the, key, of, c, major, this, would, involve, moving, to, the, key, of, g, major, which, uses, an, f, composers, also, often, modulate, to, other, related, keys, in, some, romantic, music, era, pieces, and, contemporary, music, composers, modulate, to, remote, keys, that, are, not, related, to, or, close, to, the, tonic, an, example, of, a, remote, modulation, would, be, taking, a, song, that, begins, in, c, major, and, modulating, changing, keys, to, f, major, through, the, introduction, of, blue, notes, jazz, and, blues, employ, scale, intervals, smaller, than, a, semitone, the, blue, note, is, an, interval, that, is, technically, neither, major, nor, minor, but, in, the, middle, giving, it, a, characteristic, flavour, a, regular, piano, cannot, play, blue, notes, but, with, electric, guitar, saxophone, trombone, and, trumpet, performers, can, bend, notes, a, fraction, of, a, tone, sharp, or, flat, to, create, blue, notes, for, instance, in, the, key, of, e, the, blue, note, would, be, either, a, note, between, g, and, g, or, a, note, moving, between, both, in, blues, a, pentatonic, scale, is, often, used, in, jazz, many, different, modes, and, scales, are, used, often, within, the, same, piece, of, music, chromatic, scales, are, common, especially, in, modern, jazz, in, western, music, scale, notes, are, often, separated, by, equally, tempered, tones, or, semitones, creating, 12, intervals, per, octave, each, interval, separates, two, tones, the, higher, tone, has, an, oscillation, frequency, of, a, fixed, ratio, by, a, factor, equal, to, the, twelfth, root, of, two, or, approximately, 1, 059463, higher, than, the, frequency, of, the, lower, one, a, scale, uses, a, subset, consisting, typically, of, 7, of, these, 12, as, scale, steps, many, other, musical, traditions, use, scales, that, include, other, intervals, these, scales, originate, within, the, derivation, of, the, harmonic, series, musical, intervals, are, complementary, values, of, the, harmonic, overtones, series, many, musical, scales, in, the, world, are, based, on, this, system, except, most, of, the, musical, scales, from, indonesia, and, the, indochina, peninsulae, which, are, based, on, inharmonic, resonance, of, the, dominant, metalophone, and, xylophone, instruments, some, scales, use, a, different, number, of, pitches, a, common, scale, in, eastern, music, is, the, pentatonic, scale, which, consists, of, five, notes, that, span, an, octave, for, example, in, the, chinese, culture, the, pentatonic, scale, is, usually, used, for, folk, music, and, consists, of, c, d, e, g, and, a, commonly, known, as, gong, shang, jue, chi, and, yu, some, scales, span, part, of, an, octave, several, such, short, scales, are, typically, combined, to, form, a, scale, spanning, a, full, octave, or, more, and, usually, called, with, a, third, name, of, its, own, the, turkish, and, middle, eastern, music, has, around, a, dozen, such, basic, short, scales, that, are, combined, to, form, hundreds, of, full, octave, spanning, scales, among, these, scales, hejaz, scale, has, one, scale, step, spanning, 14, intervals, of, the, middle, eastern, type, found, 53, in, an, octave, roughly, similar, to, 3, semitones, of, the, western, type, found, 12, in, an, octave, while, saba, scale, another, of, these, middle, eastern, scales, has, 3, consecutive, scale, steps, within, 14, commas, i, e, separated, by, roughly, one, western, semitone, either, side, of, the, middle, tone, gamelan, music, uses, a, small, variety, of, scales, including, p, log, and, sl, ndro, none, including, equally, tempered, nor, harmonic, intervals, indian, classical, music, uses, a, moveable, seven, note, scale, indian, r, gas, often, use, intervals, smaller, than, a, semitone, turkish, music, turkish, makams, and, arabic, music, maqamat, may, use, quarter, tone, intervals, in, both, r, gas, and, maqamat, the, distance, between, a, note, and, an, inflection, e, g, ruti, of, that, same, note, may, be, less, than, a, semitone
