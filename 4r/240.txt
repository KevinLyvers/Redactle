metaphysics, greek, those, after, the, physics, latin, metaphysica, is, one, of, the, principal, works, of, aristotle, in, which, he, develops, the, doctrine, that, he, calls, first, philosophy, the, work, is, a, compilation, of, various, texts, treating, abstract, subjects, notably, substance, theory, different, kinds, of, causation, form, and, matter, the, existence, of, mathematical, objects, and, the, cosmos, which, together, constitute, much, of, the, branch, of, philosophy, later, known, as, metaphysics, many, of, aristotle, s, works, are, extremely, compressed, and, many, scholars, believe, that, in, their, current, form, they, are, likely, lecture, notes, subsequent, to, the, arrangement, of, aristotle, s, works, by, andronicus, of, rhodes, in, the, first, century, bc, a, number, of, his, treatises, were, referred, to, as, the, writings, after, meta, the, physics, the, origin, of, the, current, title, for, the, collection, metaphysics, some, have, interpreted, the, expression, meta, to, imply, that, the, subject, of, the, work, goes, beyond, that, of, aristotle, s, physics, or, that, it, is, metatheoretical, in, relation, to, the, physics, but, others, believe, that, meta, referred, simply, to, the, work, s, place, in, the, canonical, arrangement, of, aristotle, s, writings, which, is, at, least, as, old, as, andronicus, of, rhodes, or, even, hermippus, of, smyrna, in, other, surviving, works, of, aristotle, the, metaphysical, treatises, are, referred, to, as, the, concerning, first, philosophy, which, was, the, term, aristotle, used, for, metaphysics, it, is, notoriously, difficult, to, specify, the, date, at, which, aristotle, wrote, these, treatises, as, a, whole, or, even, individually, especially, because, the, metaphysics, is, in, jonathan, barnes, words, a, farrago, a, hotch, potch, and, more, generally, because, of, the, difficulty, of, dating, any, of, aristotle, s, writings, the, order, in, which, the, books, were, written, is, not, known, their, arrangement, is, due, to, later, editors, in, the, manuscripts, books, are, referred, to, by, greek, letters, for, many, scholars, it, is, customary, to, refer, to, the, books, by, their, letter, names, book, 1, is, called, alpha, 2, little, alpha, 3, beta, 4, gamma, 5, delta, 6, epsilon, 7, zeta, 8, eta, 9, theta, 10, iota, 11, kappa, 12, lambda, 13, mu, 14, nu, books, zeta, eta, and, theta, are, generally, considered, the, core, of, the, metaphysics, book, zeta, vii, begins, by, stating, that, being, has, several, senses, the, purpose, of, philosophy, is, to, understand, the, primary, kind, of, being, called, substance, ousia, and, determine, what, substances, there, are, a, concept, that, aristotle, develops, in, the, categories, zeta, goes, on, to, consider, four, candidates, for, substance, i, the, essence, or, what, it, is, to, be, of, a, thing, ii, the, universal, iii, the, genus, to, which, a, substance, belongs, and, iv, the, material, substrate, that, underlies, all, the, properties, of, a, thing, finally, he, concludes, book, zeta, by, arguing, that, substance, is, really, a, cause, book, eta, consists, of, a, summary, of, what, has, been, said, so, far, i, e, in, book, zeta, about, substance, and, adds, a, few, further, details, regarding, difference, and, unity, book, theta, sets, out, to, define, potentiality, and, actuality, chapters, 1, 5, discuss, potentiality, the, potential, of, something, to, change, potentiality, is, a, principle, of, change, in, another, thing, or, in, the, thing, itself, qua, other, in, chapter, 6, aristotle, turns, to, actuality, we, can, only, know, actuality, through, observation, or, analogy, thus, as, that, which, builds, is, to, that, which, is, capable, of, building, so, is, that, which, is, awake, to, that, which, is, asleep, or, that, which, is, separated, from, matter, to, matter, itself, actuality, is, the, completed, state, of, something, that, had, the, potential, to, be, completed, the, relationship, between, actuality, and, potentiality, can, be, thought, of, as, the, relationship, between, form, and, matter, but, with, the, added, aspect, of, time, actuality, and, potentiality, are, distinctions, that, occur, over, time, diachronic, whereas, form, and, matter, are, distinctions, that, can, be, made, at, fixed, points, in, time, synchronic, the, metaphysics, is, considered, to, be, one, of, the, greatest, philosophical, works, its, influence, on, the, greeks, the, muslim, philosophers, maimonides, thence, the, scholastic, philosophers, and, even, writers, such, as, dante, was, immense, in, the, 3rd, century, alexander, of, aphrodisias, wrote, a, commentary, on, the, first, five, books, of, the, metaphysics, and, a, commentary, transmitted, under, his, name, exists, for, the, final, nine, but, modern, scholars, doubt, that, this, part, was, written, by, him, themistius, wrote, an, epitome, of, the, work, of, which, book, 12, survives, in, a, hebrew, translation, the, neoplatonists, syrianus, and, asclepius, of, tralles, also, wrote, commentaries, on, the, work, where, they, attempted, to, synthesize, aristotle, s, doctrines, with, neoplatonic, cosmology, aristotle, s, works, gained, a, reputation, for, complexity, that, is, never, more, evident, than, with, the, metaphysics, avicenna, said, that, he, had, read, the, metaphysics, of, aristotle, forty, times, but, did, not, understand, it, until, he, also, read, al, farabi, s, purposes, of, the, metaphysics, of, aristotle, i, read, the, metaphysics, but, i, could, not, comprehend, its, contents, and, its, author, s, object, remained, obscure, to, me, even, when, i, had, gone, back, and, read, it, forty, times, and, had, got, to, the, point, where, i, had, memorized, it, in, spite, of, this, i, could, not, understand, it, nor, its, object, and, i, despaired, of, myself, and, said, this, is, a, book, which, there, is, no, way, of, understanding, but, one, day, in, the, afternoon, when, i, was, at, the, booksellers, quarter, a, salesman, approached, with, a, book, in, his, hand, which, he, was, calling, out, for, sale, so, i, bought, it, and, lo, and, behold, it, was, abu, nasr, al, farabi, s, book, on, the, objects, of, the, metaphysics, i, returned, home, and, was, quick, to, read, it, and, in, no, time, the, objects, of, that, book, became, clear, to, me, because, i, had, got, to, the, point, of, having, memorized, it, by, heart, the, flourishing, of, arabic, aristotelian, scholarship, reached, its, peak, with, the, work, of, ibn, rushd, latinized, averroes, whose, extensive, writings, on, aristotle, s, work, led, to, his, later, designation, as, the, commentator, by, future, generations, of, scholars, maimonides, wrote, the, guide, to, the, perplexed, in, the, 12th, century, to, demonstrate, the, compatibility, of, aristotelian, science, with, biblical, revelation, the, fourth, crusade, 1202, 1204, facilitated, the, discovery, and, delivery, of, many, original, greek, manuscripts, to, western, europe, william, of, moerbeke, s, translations, of, the, work, formed, the, basis, of, the, commentaries, on, the, metaphysics, by, albert, the, great, thomas, aquinas, and, duns, scotus, they, were, also, used, by, modern, scholars, for, greek, editions, as, william, had, access, to, greek, manuscripts, that, are, now, lost, werner, jaeger, lists, william, s, translation, in, his, edition, of, the, greek, text, in, the, scriptorum, classicorum, bibliotheca, oxoniensis, oxford, 1962, in, the, 19th, century, with, the, rise, of, textual, criticism, the, metaphysics, was, examined, anew, critics, noting, the, wide, variety, of, topics, and, the, seemingly, illogical, order, of, the, books, concluded, that, it, was, actually, a, collection, of, shorter, works, thrown, together, haphazardly, in, the, 20th, century, two, general, editions, have, been, produced, by, w, d, ross, 1924, and, by, w, jaeger, 1957, based, on, a, careful, study, of, the, content, and, of, the, cross, references, within, them, w, d, ross, concluded, that, books, a, b, e, z, h, m, n, and, i, form, a, more, or, less, continuous, work, while, the, remaining, books, and, were, inserted, into, their, present, locations, by, later, editors, however, ross, cautions, that, books, a, b, e, z, h, m, n, and, i, with, or, without, the, insertion, of, the, others, do, not, constitute, a, complete, work, werner, jaeger, further, maintained, that, the, different, books, were, taken, from, different, periods, of, aristotle, s, life, everyman, s, library, for, their, 1000th, volume, published, the, metaphysics, in, a, rearranged, order, that, was, intended, to, make, the, work, easier, for, readers, editing, the, metaphysics, has, become, an, open, issue, in, works, and, studies, of, the, new, millennium, new, critical, editions, have, been, produced, of, books, gamma, alpha, and, lambda, differences, from, the, more, familiar, 20th, century, critical, editions, of, ross, and, jaeger, mainly, depend, on, the, stemma, codicum, of, aristotle, s, metaphysics, of, which, different, versions, have, been, proposed, since, 1970
