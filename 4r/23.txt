neoclassical, architecture, sometimes, referred, to, as, classical, revival, architecture, is, an, architectural, style, produced, by, the, neoclassical, movement, that, began, in, the, mid, 18th, century, in, italy, france, and, germany, it, became, one, of, the, most, prominent, architectural, styles, in, the, western, world, the, prevailing, styles, of, architecture, in, most, of, europe, for, the, previous, two, centuries, renaissance, architecture, and, baroque, architecture, already, represented, partial, revivals, of, the, classical, architecture, of, ancient, rome, and, ancient, greek, architecture, but, the, neoclassical, movement, aimed, to, strip, away, the, excesses, of, late, baroque, and, return, to, a, purer, more, complete, and, more, authentic, classical, style, adapted, to, modern, purposes, the, development, of, archaeology, and, published, accurate, records, of, surviving, classical, buildings, was, crucial, in, the, emergence, of, neoclassical, architecture, in, many, countries, there, was, an, initial, wave, essentially, drawing, on, roman, architecture, followed, from, about, the, start, of, the, 19th, century, by, a, second, wave, of, greek, revival, architecture, this, followed, increased, understanding, of, greek, survivals, as, the, 19th, century, continued, the, style, tended, to, lose, its, original, rather, austere, purity, in, variants, like, the, french, empire, style, the, term, neoclassical, is, often, used, very, loosely, for, any, building, using, some, of, the, classical, architectural, vocabulary, in, form, neoclassical, architecture, emphasizes, the, wall, rather, than, chiaroscuro, and, maintains, separate, identities, to, each, of, its, parts, the, style, is, manifested, both, in, its, details, as, a, reaction, against, the, rococo, style, of, naturalistic, ornament, and, in, its, architectural, formulae, as, an, outgrowth, of, some, classicizing, features, of, the, late, baroque, architectural, tradition, therefore, the, style, is, defined, by, symmetry, simple, geometry, and, social, demands, instead, of, ornament, in, the, 21st, century, a, version, of, the, style, continues, sometimes, called, new, classical, architecture, or, new, classicism, neoclassical, architecture, is, a, specific, style, and, moment, in, the, late, 18th, and, early, 19th, centuries, that, was, specifically, associated, with, the, enlightenment, empiricism, and, the, study, of, sites, by, early, archaeologists, classical, architecture, after, about, 1840, must, be, classified, as, one, of, a, series, of, revival, styles, such, as, greek, renaissance, or, italianate, various, historians, of, the, 19th, century, have, made, this, clear, since, the, 1970s, classical, architecture, during, the, 20th, century, is, classified, less, as, a, revival, and, more, a, return, to, a, style, that, was, decelerated, with, the, advent, of, modernism, yet, still, neoclassical, architecture, is, beginning, to, be, practiced, again, in, the, 21st, century, more, in, the, form, of, new, classical, architecture, and, even, in, gentrification, and, historicism, architecture, the, neoclassical, architecture, or, its, important, elements, are, still, being, used, even, when, postmodern, architecture, is, dominant, throughout, the, world, a, return, to, more, classical, architectural, forms, as, a, reaction, to, the, rococo, style, can, be, detected, in, some, european, architecture, of, the, earlier, 18th, century, most, vividly, represented, in, the, palladian, architecture, of, georgian, britain, and, ireland, the, name, refers, to, the, designs, of, the, 16th, century, venetian, architect, andrea, palladio, the, baroque, style, had, never, truly, been, to, the, english, taste, four, influential, books, were, published, in, the, first, quarter, of, the, 18th, century, which, highlighted, the, simplicity, and, purity, of, classical, architecture, vitruvius, britannicus, by, colen, campbell, 1715, palladio, s, i, quattro, libri, dell, architettura, the, four, books, of, architecture, 1715, de, re, aedificatoria, by, leon, battista, alberti, first, published, in, 1452, and, the, designs, of, inigo, jones, with, some, additional, designs, 1727, the, most, popular, was, the, four, volume, vitruvius, britannicus, by, colen, campbell, the, book, contained, architectural, prints, of, famous, british, buildings, that, had, been, inspired, by, the, great, architects, from, vitruvius, to, palladio, at, first, the, book, mainly, featured, the, work, of, inigo, jones, but, the, later, tomes, contained, drawings, and, plans, by, campbell, and, other, 18th, century, architects, palladian, architecture, became, well, established, in, 18th, century, britain, at, the, forefront, of, the, new, school, of, design, was, the, aristocratic, architect, earl, richard, boyle, 3rd, earl, of, burlington, in, 1729, he, and, william, kent, designed, chiswick, house, this, house, was, a, reinterpretation, of, palladio, s, villa, capra, la, rotonda, but, purified, of, 16th, century, elements, and, ornament, this, severe, lack, of, ornamentation, was, to, be, a, feature, of, palladianism, in, 1734, william, kent, and, lord, burlington, designed, one, of, england, s, finest, examples, of, palladian, architecture, holkham, hall, in, norfolk, the, main, block, of, this, house, followed, palladio, s, dictates, quite, closely, but, palladio, s, low, often, detached, wings, of, farm, buildings, were, elevated, in, significance, this, classicizing, vein, was, also, detectable, to, a, lesser, degree, in, the, late, baroque, architecture, in, paris, such, as, in, the, louvre, colonnade, this, shift, was, even, visible, in, rome, at, the, redesigned, fa, ade, for, archbasilica, of, saint, john, lateran, by, the, mid, 18th, century, the, movement, broadened, to, incorporate, a, greater, range, of, classical, influences, including, those, from, ancient, greece, an, early, centre, of, neoclassicism, was, italy, especially, naples, where, by, the, 1730s, court, architects, such, as, luigi, vanvitelli, and, ferdinando, fuga, were, recovering, classical, palladian, and, mannerist, forms, in, their, baroque, architecture, following, their, lead, giovanni, antonio, medrano, began, to, build, the, first, truly, neoclassical, structures, in, italy, in, the, 1730s, in, the, same, period, alessandro, pompei, introduced, neoclassicism, to, the, venetian, republic, building, one, of, the, first, lapidariums, in, europe, in, verona, in, the, doric, style, 1738, during, the, same, period, neoclassical, elements, were, introduced, to, tuscany, by, architect, jean, nicolas, jadot, de, ville, issey, the, court, architect, of, francis, stephen, of, lorraine, on, jadot, s, lead, an, original, neoclassical, style, was, developed, by, gaspare, maria, paoletti, transforming, florence, into, the, most, important, centre, of, neoclassicism, in, the, peninsula, in, the, second, half, of, the, century, neoclassicism, flourished, also, in, turin, milan, giuseppe, piermarini, and, trieste, matteo, pertsch, in, the, latter, two, cities, just, as, in, tuscany, the, sober, neoclassical, style, was, linked, to, the, reformism, of, the, ruling, habsburg, enlightened, monarchs, the, shift, to, neoclassical, architecture, is, conventionally, dated, to, the, 1750s, it, first, gained, influence, in, england, and, france, in, england, sir, william, hamilton, s, excavations, at, pompeii, and, other, sites, the, influence, of, the, grand, tour, and, the, work, of, william, chambers, and, robert, adam, were, pivotal, in, this, regard, in, france, the, movement, was, propelled, by, a, generation, of, french, art, students, trained, in, rome, and, was, influenced, by, the, writings, of, johann, joachim, winckelmann, the, style, was, also, adopted, by, progressive, circles, in, other, countries, such, as, sweden, and, russia, international, neoclassical, architecture, was, exemplified, in, karl, friedrich, schinkel, s, buildings, especially, the, altes, museum, in, berlin, sir, john, soane, s, bank, of, england, in, london, and, the, newly, built, white, house, and, capitol, in, washington, d, c, of, the, nascent, american, republic, the, style, was, international, the, baltimore, basilica, which, was, designed, by, benjamin, henry, latrobe, in, 1806, is, considered, one, of, the, finest, examples, of, neoclassical, architecture, in, the, world, a, second, neoclassic, wave, more, severe, more, studied, and, more, consciously, archaeological, is, associated, with, the, height, of, the, first, french, empire, in, france, the, first, phase, of, neoclassicism, was, expressed, in, the, louis, xvi, style, and, the, second, in, the, styles, called, directoire, and, empire, its, major, proponents, were, percier, and, fontaine, court, architects, who, specialized, in, interior, decoration, in, the, decorative, arts, neoclassicism, is, exemplified, in, french, furniture, of, the, empire, style, the, english, furniture, of, chippendale, george, hepplewhite, and, robert, adam, wedgwood, s, bas, reliefs, and, black, basaltes, vases, and, the, biedermeier, furniture, of, austria, the, scottish, architect, charles, cameron, created, palatial, italianate, interiors, for, the, german, born, catherine, the, great, in, saint, petersburg, indoors, neoclassicism, made, a, discovery, of, the, genuine, classic, interior, inspired, by, the, rediscoveries, at, pompeii, and, herculaneum, these, had, begun, in, the, late, 1740s, but, only, achieved, a, wide, audience, in, the, 1760s, with, the, first, luxurious, volumes, of, tightly, controlled, distribution, of, le, antichit, di, ercolano, esposte, the, antiquities, of, herculaneum, exposed, the, antiquities, of, herculaneum, showed, that, even, the, most, classicizing, interiors, of, the, baroque, or, the, most, roman, rooms, of, william, kent, were, based, on, basilica, and, temple, exterior, architecture, turned, outside, in, hence, their, often, bombastic, appearance, to, modern, eyes, pedimented, window, frames, turned, into, gilded, mirrors, fireplaces, topped, with, temple, fronts, the, new, interiors, sought, to, recreate, an, authentically, roman, and, genuinely, interior, vocabulary, techniques, employed, in, the, style, included, flatter, lighter, motifs, sculpted, in, low, frieze, like, relief, or, painted, in, monotones, en, cama, eu, like, cameos, isolated, medallions, or, vases, or, busts, or, bucrania, or, other, motifs, suspended, on, swags, of, laurel, or, ribbon, with, slender, arabesques, against, backgrounds, perhaps, of, pompeiian, red, or, pale, tints, or, stone, colours, the, style, in, france, was, initially, a, parisian, style, the, go, t, grec, greek, taste, not, a, court, style, when, louis, xvi, acceded, to, the, throne, in, 1774, marie, antoinette, his, fashion, loving, queen, brought, the, louis, xvi, style, to, court, however, there, was, no, real, attempt, to, employ, the, basic, forms, of, roman, furniture, until, around, the, turn, of, the, century, and, furniture, makers, were, more, likely, to, borrow, from, ancient, architecture, just, as, silversmiths, were, more, likely, to, take, from, ancient, pottery, and, stone, carving, than, metalwork, designers, and, craftsmen, seem, to, have, taken, an, almost, perverse, pleasure, in, transferring, motifs, from, one, medium, to, another, a, new, phase, in, neoclassical, design, was, inaugurated, by, robert, and, james, adam, who, travelled, in, italy, and, dalmatia, in, the, 1750s, observing, the, ruins, of, the, classical, world, on, their, return, to, britain, they, published, a, book, entitled, the, works, in, architecture, in, installments, between, 1773, and, 1779, this, book, of, engraved, designs, made, the, adam, style, available, throughout, europe, the, adam, brothers, aimed, to, simplify, the, rococo, and, baroque, styles, which, had, been, fashionable, in, the, preceding, decades, to, bring, what, they, felt, to, be, a, lighter, and, more, elegant, feel, to, georgian, houses, the, works, in, architecture, illustrated, the, main, buildings, the, adam, brothers, had, worked, on, and, crucially, documented, the, interiors, furniture, and, fittings, designed, by, the, adams, from, about, 1800, a, fresh, influx, of, greek, architectural, examples, seen, through, the, medium, of, etchings, and, engravings, gave, a, new, impetus, to, neoclassicism, the, greek, revival, there, was, little, direct, knowledge, of, surviving, greek, buildings, before, the, middle, of, the, 18th, century, in, western, europe, when, an, expedition, funded, by, the, society, of, dilettanti, in, 1751, and, led, by, james, stuart, and, nicholas, revett, began, serious, archaeological, enquiry, stuart, was, commissioned, after, his, return, from, greece, by, george, lyttelton, to, produce, the, first, greek, building, in, england, the, garden, temple, at, hagley, hall, 1758, 59, a, number, of, british, architects, in, the, second, half, of, the, century, took, up, the, expressive, challenge, of, the, doric, from, their, aristocratic, patrons, including, joseph, bonomi, the, elder, and, john, soane, but, it, was, to, remain, the, private, enthusiasm, of, connoisseurs, up, to, the, first, decade, of, the, 19th, century, seen, in, its, wider, social, context, greek, revival, architecture, sounded, a, new, note, of, sobriety, and, restraint, in, public, buildings, in, britain, around, 1800, as, an, assertion, of, nationalism, attendant, on, the, act, of, union, the, napoleonic, wars, and, the, clamour, for, political, reform, it, was, to, be, william, wilkins, s, winning, design, for, the, public, competition, for, downing, college, cambridge, that, announced, the, greek, style, was, to, be, the, dominant, idiom, in, architecture, wilkins, and, robert, smirke, went, on, to, build, some, of, the, most, important, buildings, of, the, era, including, the, theatre, royal, covent, garden, 1808, 1809, the, general, post, office, 1824, 1829, and, the, british, museum, 1823, 1848, wilkins, university, college, london, 1826, 1830, and, the, national, gallery, 1832, 1838, in, scotland, thomas, hamilton, 1784, 1858, in, collaboration, with, the, artists, andrew, wilson, 1780, 1848, and, hugh, william, williams, 1773, 1829, created, monuments, and, buildings, of, international, significance, the, burns, monument, at, alloway, 1818, and, the, royal, high, school, edinburgh, 1823, 1829, at, the, same, time, the, empire, style, in, france, was, a, more, grandiose, wave, of, neoclassicism, in, architecture, and, the, decorative, arts, mainly, based, on, imperial, roman, styles, it, originated, in, and, took, its, name, from, the, rule, of, napoleon, i, in, the, first, french, empire, where, it, was, intended, to, idealize, napoleon, s, leadership, and, the, french, state, the, style, corresponds, to, the, more, bourgeois, biedermeier, style, in, the, german, speaking, lands, federal, style, in, the, united, states, the, regency, style, in, britain, and, the, napoleonstil, in, sweden, according, to, the, art, historian, hugh, honour, so, far, from, being, as, is, sometimes, supposed, the, culmination, of, the, neo, classical, movement, the, empire, marks, its, rapid, decline, and, transformation, back, once, more, into, a, mere, antique, revival, drained, of, all, the, high, minded, ideas, and, force, of, conviction, that, had, inspired, its, masterpieces, high, neoclassicism, was, an, international, movement, architects, reacted, against, the, excesses, and, profuse, ornament, used, in, late, baroque, architecture, the, new, classical, architecture, emphasized, planar, qualities, rather, than, elaborate, sculptural, ornament, in, both, the, interior, and, the, exterior, projections, and, recessions, and, their, effects, of, light, and, shade, were, more, flat, sculptural, bas, reliefs, were, flat, and, tended, to, be, framed, by, friezes, tablets, or, panels, this, was, the, first, stripped, down, classical, architecture, and, appeared, to, be, modern, in, the, context, of, the, revolutionary, period, in, europe, at, its, most, elemental, as, in, the, work, of, etienne, louis, boull, e, it, was, highly, abstract, and, geometrically, pure, neoclassicism, also, influenced, city, planning, the, ancient, romans, had, used, a, consolidated, scheme, for, city, planning, for, both, defence, and, civil, convenience, however, the, roots, of, this, scheme, go, back, to, even, older, civilizations, at, its, most, basic, the, grid, system, of, streets, a, central, forum, with, city, services, two, main, slightly, wider, boulevards, and, the, occasional, diagonal, street, were, characteristic, of, the, very, logical, and, orderly, roman, design, ancient, fa, ades, and, building, layouts, were, oriented, to, these, city, design, patterns, and, they, tended, to, work, in, proportion, with, the, importance, of, public, buildings, many, of, these, urban, planning, patterns, found, their, way, into, the, first, modern, planned, cities, of, the, 18th, century, exceptional, examples, include, karlsruhe, washington, d, c, saint, petersburg, buenos, aires, havana, and, barcelona, contrasting, models, may, be, found, in, modernist, designs, exemplified, by, bras, lia, the, garden, city, movement, and, levittowns, the, first, phase, of, neoclassicism, in, france, is, expressed, in, the, louis, xv, style, of, architect, ange, jacques, gabriel, petit, trianon, 1762, 1768, the, second, phase, in, the, styles, called, directoire, and, empire, might, be, characterized, by, jean, chalgrin, s, severe, astylar, arc, de, triomphe, designed, in, 1806, in, england, the, two, phases, might, be, characterized, first, by, the, structures, of, robert, adam, the, second, by, those, of, sir, john, soane, the, interior, style, in, france, was, initially, a, parisian, style, the, go, t, grec, greek, style, not, a, court, style, only, when, the, young, king, louis, xvi, acceded, to, the, throne, in, 1774, did, marie, antoinette, his, fashion, loving, queen, bring, the, louis, xvi, style, to, court, many, early, 19th, century, neoclassical, architects, were, influenced, by, the, drawings, and, projects, of, tienne, louis, boull, e, and, claude, nicolas, ledoux, the, many, graphite, drawings, of, boull, e, and, his, students, depict, spare, geometrical, architecture, that, emulates, the, eternality, of, the, universe, there, are, links, between, boull, e, s, ideas, and, edmund, burke, s, conception, of, the, sublime, ledoux, addressed, the, concept, of, architectural, character, maintaining, that, a, building, should, immediately, communicate, its, function, to, the, viewer, taken, literally, such, ideas, give, rise, to, architecture, parlante, speaking, architecture, from, about, 1800, a, fresh, influx, of, greek, architectural, examples, seen, through, the, medium, of, etchings, and, engravings, gave, a, new, impetus, to, neoclassicism, that, is, called, the, greek, revival, although, several, european, cities, notably, saint, petersburg, athens, berlin, and, munich, were, transformed, into, veritable, museums, of, greek, revival, architecture, the, greek, revival, in, france, was, never, popular, with, either, the, state, or, the, public, neoclassical, architecture, became, a, symbol, of, national, pride, during, the, 18th, century, in, germany, in, what, was, then, prussia, karl, friedrich, schinkel, built, many, notable, buildings, in, this, style, including, the, altes, museum, in, berlin, while, the, city, remained, dominated, by, baroque, city, planning, his, architecture, and, functional, style, provided, the, city, with, a, distinctly, neoclassical, center, schinkel, s, work, is, very, comparable, to, neoclassical, architecture, in, britain, since, he, drew, much, of, his, inspiration, from, that, country, he, made, trips, to, observe, the, buildings, and, develop, his, functional, style, from, the, middle, of, the, 18th, century, exploration, and, publication, changed, the, course, of, british, architecture, from, the, palladian, architecture, towards, a, purer, vision, of, the, ancient, greco, roman, ideal, james, athenian, stuart, s, work, the, antiquities, of, athens, and, other, monuments, of, greece, was, very, influential, in, this, regard, as, were, robert, wood, s, palmyra, and, baalbec, a, combination, of, simple, forms, and, high, levels, of, enrichment, was, adopted, by, the, majority, of, contemporary, british, architects, and, designers, the, revolution, begun, by, stuart, was, soon, to, be, eclipsed, by, the, work, of, the, adam, brothers, james, wyatt, sir, william, chambers, george, dance, the, younger, james, gandon, and, provincially, based, architects, such, as, john, carr, and, thomas, harrison, of, chester, in, scotland, and, the, north, of, england, where, the, gothic, revival, was, less, strong, architects, continued, to, develop, the, neoclassical, style, of, william, henry, playfair, the, works, of, cuthbert, brodrick, and, alexander, thomson, show, that, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, the, results, could, be, powerful, and, eccentric, in, ireland, where, gothic, revival, was, also, less, popular, a, refined, restrained, form, of, the, neoclassical, developed, and, can, be, seen, in, the, works, of, james, gandon, and, other, architects, working, at, the, time, it, is, particularly, evident, in, dublin, which, is, a, largely, neoclassical, and, georgian, city, after, the, establishment, of, the, kingdom, of, greece, in, 1832, the, architecture, of, greece, was, mostly, influenced, by, the, neoclassical, architecture, for, athens, the, first, king, of, greece, otto, i, commissioned, the, architects, stamatios, kleanthis, and, eduard, schaubert, to, design, a, modern, city, plan, the, old, royal, palace, was, the, first, important, public, building, to, be, built, between, 1836, and, 1843, later, in, the, mid, and, late, 19th, century, theophil, hansen, and, ernst, ziller, took, part, in, the, construction, of, many, neoclassical, buildings, theophil, hansen, designed, his, first, building, the, national, observatory, of, athens, and, two, of, the, three, contiguous, buildings, forming, the, so, called, athens, classical, trilogy, namely, the, academy, of, athens, 1859, and, the, national, library, of, greece, 1888, the, third, building, of, the, trilogy, being, the, national, and, capodistrian, university, of, athens, 1843, which, was, designed, by, his, brother, christian, hansen, also, he, designed, the, zappeion, hall, 1888, ernst, ziller, also, designed, many, private, mansions, in, the, centre, of, athens, which, gradually, became, public, usually, through, donations, such, the, mansion, of, heinrich, schliemann, iliou, melathron, 1880, the, city, of, nauplio, is, also, an, important, example, of, neoclassical, architecture, along, with, the, islands, of, poros, and, syros, especially, in, the, capital, ermoupoli, the, earliest, examples, of, neoclassical, architecture, in, hungary, may, be, found, in, v, c, in, this, town, the, triumphal, arch, and, the, neoclassical, fa, ade, of, the, baroque, cathedral, were, designed, by, the, french, architect, isidor, marcellus, amandus, ganneval, isidore, canevale, in, the, 1760s, also, the, work, of, a, french, architect, jean, charles, alexandre, moreau, is, the, garden, fa, ade, of, the, esterh, zy, palace, 1797, 1805, in, kismarton, today, eisenstadt, in, austria, the, two, principal, architects, of, neoclassicism, in, hungary, were, mih, ly, pollack, and, j, zsef, hild, pollack, s, major, work, is, the, hungarian, national, museum, 1837, 1844, hild, is, famous, for, his, designs, for, the, cathedral, of, eger, and, esztergom, the, reformed, great, church, of, debrecen, is, an, outstanding, example, of, the, many, protestant, churches, that, were, built, in, the, first, half, of, the, 19th, century, this, was, the, time, of, the, first, iron, structures, in, hungarian, architecture, the, most, important, of, which, is, the, sz, chenyi, chain, bridge, by, william, tierney, clark, although, not, a, western, country, due, to, western, influence, japan, has, had, neoclassical, architecture, produced, in, it, this, includes, the, unique, hiko, shrine, which, is, a, shinto, shrine, based, on, greek, temples, it, later, developed, into, the, imperial, crown, style, which, contains, elements, of, both, eastern, and, western, design, roofs, are, notably, distinctly, asian, in, this, style, and, it, was, used, heavily, by, the, japanese, empire, in, its, colonies, neoclassical, architecture, was, introduced, in, malta, in, the, late, 18th, century, during, the, final, years, of, hospitaller, rule, early, examples, include, the, bibliotheca, 1786, the, de, rohan, arch, 1798, and, the, hompesch, gate, 1801, however, neoclassical, architecture, only, became, popular, in, malta, following, the, establishment, of, british, rule, in, the, early, 19th, century, in, 1814, a, neoclassical, portico, decorated, with, the, british, coat, of, arms, was, added, to, the, main, guard, building, so, as, to, serve, as, a, symbol, of, british, malta, other, 19th, century, neoclassical, buildings, include, the, monument, to, sir, alexander, ball, 1810, rnh, bighi, 1832, st, paul, s, pro, cathedral,
