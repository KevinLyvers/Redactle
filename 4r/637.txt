mgm, pandro, s, berman, at, rko, radio, pictures, and, david, o, selznick, of, selznick, international, pictures, jack, l, warner, of, warner, bros, considered, purchasing, the, rights, after, reading, the, synopsis, but, his, biggest, star, bette, davis, was, not, interested, at, the, time, and, darryl, f, zanuck, of, 20th, century, fox, had, not, offered, enough, money, however, selznick, changed, his, mind, after, his, story, editor, kay, brown, and, business, partner, john, hay, whitney, urged, him, to, buy, the, film, rights, in, july, 1936, a, month, after, it, was, published, selznick, bought, the, rights, for, 50, 000, the, casting, of, the, two, lead, roles, became, a, complex, two, year, endeavor, for, the, role, of, rhett, butler, selznick, from, the, start, wanted, clark, gable, but, gable, was, under, contract, to, mgm, which, never, loaned, him, to, other, studios, gary, cooper, was, considered, but, samuel, goldwyn, to, whom, cooper, was, under, contract, refused, to, loan, him, out, warner, offered, a, package, of, bette, davis, errol, flynn, and, olivia, de, havilland, for, lead, roles, in, return, for, the, distribution, rights, by, this, time, selznick, was, determined, to, get, gable, and, in, august, 1938, he, eventually, struck, a, deal, with, his, father, in, law, mgm, chief, louis, b, mayer, mgm, would, provide, gable, and, 1, 250, 000, for, half, of, the, film, s, budget, and, in, return, selznick, would, have, to, pay, gable, s, weekly, salary, half, the, profits, would, go, to, mgm, while, loew, s, inc, mgm, s, parent, company, would, release, the, film, the, arrangement, to, release, through, mgm, meant, delaying, the, start, of, production, until, the, end, of, 1938, when, selznick, s, distribution, deal, with, united, artists, concluded, selznick, used, the, delay, to, continue, to, revise, the, script, and, more, importantly, build, publicity, for, the, film, through, their, endeavors, to, cast, the, role, of, scarlett, selznick, began, a, nationwide, casting, call, interviewing, 1, 400, unknowns, the, effort, cost, 100, 000, and, proved, useless, for, the, main, objective, of, casting, the, role, but, created, priceless, publicity, early, frontrunners, included, miriam, hopkins, and, tallulah, bankhead, who, were, regarded, as, possibilities, by, selznick, prior, to, the, purchase, of, the, film, rights, joan, crawford, who, was, signed, to, mgm, was, also, considered, as, a, potential, pairing, with, gable, after, a, deal, was, struck, with, mgm, selznick, held, discussions, with, norma, shearer, who, was, mgm, s, top, female, star, at, the, time, but, she, withdrew, herself, from, consideration, after, negative, feedback, from, movie, fans, katharine, hepburn, lobbied, hard, for, the, role, with, the, support, of, her, friend, george, cukor, who, had, been, hired, to, direct, but, she, was, vetoed, by, selznick, who, felt, she, was, not, right, for, the, part, many, actresses, both, known, and, unknown, were, considered, but, only, thirty, in, addition, to, the, eventual, choice, vivien, leigh, were, actually, tested, for, the, role, including, ardis, ankerson, brenda, marshall, jean, arthur, tallulah, bankhead, diana, barrymore, joan, bennett, nancy, coleman, frances, dee, terry, ray, ellen, drew, paulette, goddard, edythe, marrenner, susan, hayward, anita, louise, haila, stoddard, margaret, tallichet, lana, turner, and, linda, watkins, although, margaret, mitchell, refused, to, publicly, name, her, choice, the, actress, who, came, closest, to, winning, her, approval, was, miriam, hopkins, whom, mitchell, felt, was, just, the, right, type, of, actress, to, play, scarlett, as, written, in, the, book, however, hopkins, was, in, her, mid, thirties, at, the, time, and, was, considered, too, old, for, the, part, four, actresses, including, jean, arthur, and, joan, bennett, were, still, under, consideration, by, december, 1938, however, only, two, finalists, paulette, goddard, and, vivien, leigh, were, tested, in, technicolor, both, on, december, 20, goddard, almost, won, the, role, but, controversy, over, her, marriage, to, charlie, chaplin, caused, selznick, to, change, his, mind, selznick, had, been, quietly, considering, vivien, leigh, a, young, english, actress, who, was, still, little, known, in, america, for, the, role, of, scarlett, since, february, 1938, when, selznick, saw, her, in, fire, over, england, and, a, yank, at, oxford, leigh, s, american, agent, was, the, london, representative, of, the, myron, selznick, talent, agency, headed, by, david, selznick, s, brother, one, of, the, owners, of, selznick, international, and, she, had, requested, in, february, that, her, name, be, submitted, for, consideration, as, scarlett, by, the, summer, of, 1938, the, selznicks, were, negotiating, with, alexander, korda, to, whom, leigh, was, under, contract, for, her, services, later, that, year, selznick, s, brother, arranged, for, them, to, meet, for, the, first, time, on, the, night, of, december, 10, 1938, when, the, burning, of, atlanta, was, filmed, in, a, letter, to, his, wife, two, days, later, selznick, admitted, that, leigh, was, the, scarlett, dark, horse, and, after, a, series, of, screen, tests, her, casting, was, announced, on, january, 13, 1939, just, before, the, shooting, of, the, film, selznick, informed, newspaper, columnist, ed, sullivan, scarlett, o, hara, s, parents, were, french, and, irish, identically, miss, leigh, s, parents, are, french, and, irish, a, pressing, issue, for, selznick, throughout, casting, was, hollywood, s, persistent, failure, to, accurately, portray, southern, accents, the, studio, believed, that, if, the, accent, was, not, accurately, depicted, it, could, prove, detrimental, to, the, film, s, success, selznick, hired, susan, myrick, an, expert, on, southern, speech, manners, and, customs, recommended, to, him, by, mitchell, and, will, a, price, to, coach, the, actors, on, speaking, with, a, southern, drawl, mitchell, was, complimentary, about, the, vocal, work, of, the, cast, noting, the, lack, of, criticism, when, the, film, came, out, of, the, original, screenplay, writer, sidney, howard, film, historian, joanne, yeck, writes, reducing, the, intricacies, of, gone, with, the, wind, s, epic, dimensions, was, a, herculean, task, and, howard, s, first, submission, was, far, too, long, and, would, have, required, at, least, six, hours, of, film, selznick, wanted, howard, to, remain, on, the, set, to, make, revisions, but, howard, refused, to, leave, new, england, as, a, result, revisions, were, handled, by, a, host, of, local, writers, selznick, dismissed, director, george, cukor, three, weeks, into, filming, and, sought, out, victor, fleming, who, was, directing, the, wizard, of, oz, at, the, time, fleming, was, dissatisfied, with, the, script, so, selznick, brought, in, the, screenwriter, ben, hecht, to, rewrite, the, entire, screenplay, within, five, days, hecht, returned, to, howard, s, original, draft, and, by, the, end, of, the, week, had, succeeded, in, revising, the, entire, first, half, of, the, script, selznick, undertook, to, rewrite, the, second, half, himself, but, fell, behind, schedule, so, howard, returned, to, work, on, the, script, for, one, week, reworking, several, key, scenes, in, part, two, by, the, time, of, the, film, s, release, in, 1939, there, was, some, question, as, to, who, should, receive, screen, credit, writes, yeck, but, despite, the, number, of, writers, and, changes, the, final, script, was, remarkably, close, to, howard, s, version, the, fact, that, howard, s, name, alone, appears, on, the, credits, may, have, been, as, much, a, gesture, to, his, memory, as, his, writing, for, in, 1939, sidney, howard, died, at, age, 48, in, a, farm, tractor, accident, and, before, the, movie, s, premiere, selznick, in, a, memo, written, in, october, 1939, discussed, the, film, s, writing, credits, ou, can, say, frankly, that, of, the, comparatively, small, amount, of, material, in, the, picture, which, is, not, from, the, book, most, is, my, own, personally, and, the, only, original, lines, of, dialog, which, are, not, my, own, are, a, few, from, sidney, howard, and, a, few, from, ben, hecht, and, a, couple, more, from, john, van, druten, offhand, i, doubt, that, there, are, ten, original, words, of, garrett, s, in, the, whole, script, as, to, construction, this, is, about, eighty, per, cent, my, own, and, the, rest, divided, between, jo, swerling, and, sidney, howard, with, hecht, having, contributed, materially, to, the, construction, of, one, sequence, according, to, hecht, s, biographer, william, macadams, at, dawn, on, sunday, february, 20, 1939, david, selznick, and, director, victor, fleming, shook, hecht, awake, to, inform, him, he, was, on, loan, from, mgm, and, must, come, with, them, immediately, and, go, to, work, on, gone, with, the, wind, which, selznick, had, begun, shooting, five, weeks, before, it, was, costing, selznick, 50, 000, each, day, the, film, was, on, hold, waiting, for, a, final, screenplay, rewrite, and, time, was, of, the, essence, hecht, was, in, the, middle, of, working, on, the, film, at, the, circus, for, the, marx, brothers, recalling, the, episode, in, a, letter, to, screenwriter, friend, gene, fowler, he, said, he, hadn, t, read, the, novel, but, selznick, and, director, fleming, could, not, wait, for, him, to, read, it, they, acted, in, scenes, based, on, sidney, howard, s, original, script, which, needed, to, be, rewritten, in, a, hurry, hecht, wrote, after, each, scene, had, been, performed, and, discussed, i, sat, down, at, the, typewriter, and, wrote, it, out, selznick, and, fleming, eager, to, continue, with, their, acting, kept, hurrying, me, we, worked, in, this, fashion, for, seven, days, putting, in, eighteen, to, twenty, hours, a, day, selznick, refused, to, let, us, eat, lunch, arguing, that, food, would, slow, us, up, he, provided, bananas, and, salted, peanuts, thus, on, the, seventh, day, i, had, completed, unscathed, the, first, nine, reels, of, the, civil, war, epic, macadams, writes, it, is, impossible, to, determine, exactly, how, much, hecht, scripted, in, the, official, credits, filed, with, the, screen, writers, guild, sidney, howard, was, of, course, awarded, the, sole, screen, credit, but, four, other, writers, were, appended, jo, swerling, for, contributing, to, the, treatment, oliver, h, p, garrett, and, barbara, keon, to, screenplay, construction, and, hecht, to, dialogue, principal, photography, began, on, january, 26, 1939, and, ended, on, july, 1, with, post, production, work, continuing, until, november, 11, 1939, director, george, cukor, with, whom, selznick, had, a, long, working, relationship, and, who, had, spent, almost, two, years, in, pre, production, on, gone, with, the, wind, was, replaced, after, less, than, three, weeks, of, shooting, selznick, and, cukor, had, already, disagreed, over, the, pace, of, filming, and, the, script, but, other, explanations, put, cukor, s, departure, down, to, gable, s, discomfort, at, working, with, him, emanuel, levy, cukor, s, biographer, claimed, that, gable, had, worked, hollywood, s, gay, circuit, as, a, hustler, and, that, cukor, knew, of, his, past, so, gable, used, his, influence, to, have, him, discharged, vivien, leigh, and, olivia, de, havilland, learned, of, cukor, s, firing, on, the, day, the, atlanta, bazaar, scene, was, filmed, and, the, pair, went, to, selznick, s, office, in, full, costume, and, implored, him, to, change, his, mind, victor, fleming, who, was, directing, the, wizard, of, oz, was, called, in, from, mgm, to, complete, the, film, however, cukor, continued, privately, to, coach, leigh, and, de, havilland, another, mgm, director, sam, wood, worked, for, two, weeks, in, may, when, fleming, temporarily, left, the, production, due, to, exhaustion, although, some, of, cukor, s, scenes, were, later, reshot, selznick, estimated, that, three, solid, reels, of, his, work, remained, in, the, final, cut, as, of, the, end, of, principal, photography, cukor, had, undertaken, eighteen, days, of, filming, fleming, ninety, three, and, wood, twenty, four, cinematographer, lee, garmes, began, the, production, but, on, march, 11, 1939, after, a, month, of, shooting, footage, that, selznick, and, his, associates, regarded, as, too, dark, was, replaced, with, ernest, haller, working, with, technicolor, cinematographer, ray, rennahan, garmes, completed, the, first, third, of, the, film, mostly, everything, prior, to, melanie, having, the, baby, but, did, not, receive, a, credit, most, of, the, filming, was, done, on, the, back, forty, of, selznick, international, with, all, the, location, scenes, being, photographed, in, california, mostly, in, los, angeles, county, or, neighboring, ventura, county, tara, the, fictional, southern, plantation, house, existed, only, as, a, plywood, and, papier, m, ch, facade, built, on, the, selznick, studio, lot, for, the, burning, of, atlanta, new, false, facades, were, built, in, front, of, the, selznick, backlot, s, many, old, abandoned, sets, and, selznick, himself, operated, the, controls, for, the, explosives, that, burned, them, down, sources, at, the, time, put, the, estimated, production, costs, at, 3, 85, million, making, it, the, second, most, expensive, film, made, up, to, that, point, with, only, ben, hur, 1925, having, cost, more, although, legend, persists, that, the, hays, office, fined, selznick, 5, 000, for, using, the, word, damn, in, butler, s, exit, line, in, fact, the, motion, picture, association, board, passed, an, amendment, to, the, production, code, on, november, 1, 1939, that, forbade, the, use, of, the, words, hell, or, damn, except, when, their, use, shall, be, essential, and, required, for, portrayal, in, proper, historical, context, of, any, scene, or, dialogue, based, upon, historical, fact, or, folklore, or, a, quotation, from, a, literary, work, provided, that, no, such, use, shall, be, permitted, which, is, intrinsically, objectionable, or, offends, good, taste, with, that, amendment, the, production, code, administration, had, no, further, objection, to, rhett, s, closing, line, selznick, chose, max, steiner, to, compose, the, score, with, whom, he, had, worked, at, rko, pictures, in, the, early, 1930s, warner, bros, who, had, contracted, steiner, in, 1936, agreed, to, lend, him, to, selznick, steiner, spent, twelve, weeks, working, on, the, score, the, most, prolonged, period, he, had, ever, spent, writing, one, and, at, two, hours, and, thirty, six, minutes, long, it, was, also, the, longest, he, had, ever, written, five, orchestrators, were, hired, hugo, friedhofer, maurice, de, packh, bernhard, kaun, adolph, deutsch, and, reginald, bassett, the, score, is, characterized, by, two, love, themes, one, for, ashley, and, melanie, s, sweet, love, and, another, that, evokes, scarlett, s, passion, for, ashley, though, notably, there, is, no, scarlett, and, rhett, love, theme, steiner, drew, considerably, on, folk, and, patriotic, music, which, included, stephen, foster, tunes, such, as, louisiana, belle, dolly, day, ringo, de, banjo, beautiful, dreamer, old, folks, at, home, and, katie, belle, which, formed, the, basis, of, scarlett, s, theme, other, tunes, that, feature, prominently, are, marching, through, georgia, by, henry, clay, work, dixie, garryowen, and, the, bonnie, blue, flag, the, theme, that, is, most, associated, with, the, film, today, is, the, melody, that, accompanies, tara, the, o, hara, plantation, in, the, early, 1940s, tara, s, theme, formed, the, musical, basis, of, the, song, my, own, true, love, by, mack, david, in, all, there, are, ninety, nine, separate, pieces, of, music, featured, in, the, score, due, to, the, pressure, of, completing, on, time, steiner, received, some, assistance, in, composing, from, friedhofer, deutsch, and, heinz, roemheld, and, in, addition, two, short, cues, by, franz, waxman,

ran, for, four, hours, and, twenty, five, minutes, it, was, later, cut, to, under, four, hours, for, its, proper, release, a, double, bill, of, hawaiian, nights, and, beau, geste, was, playing, but, after, the, first, feature, it, was, announced, that, instead, of, the, second, bill, the, theater, would, be, screening, a, preview, of, an, unnamed, upcoming, film, the, audience, were, informed, they, could, leave, but, would, not, be, readmitted, once, the, film, had, begun, nor, would, phone, calls, be, allowed, once, the, theater, had, been, sealed, when, the, title, appeared, on, the, screen, the, audience, cheered, and, after, it, had, ended, the, film, received, a, standing, ovation, in, his, biography, of, selznick, david, thomson, wrote, that, the, audience, s, response, before, the, film, had, even, started, was, the, greatest, moment, of, life, the, greatest, victory, and, redemption, of, all, his, failings, with, selznick, describing, the, preview, cards, as, probably, the, most, amazing, any, picture, has, ever, had, when, selznick, was, asked, by, the, press, in, early, september, how, he, felt, about, the, film, he, said, at, noon, i, think, it, s, divine, at, midnight, i, think, it, s, lousy, sometimes, i, think, it, s, the, greatest, picture, ever, made, but, if, it, s, only, a, great, picture, i, ll, still, be, satisfied, about, 300, 000,

ii, and, fleming, had, fallen, out, with, selznick, and, declined, to, attend, any, of, the, premieres, hattie, mcdaniel, was, also, absent, as, she, and, the, other, black, cast, members, were, prevented, from, attending, the, premiere, due, to, georgia, s, jim, crow, laws, which, kept, them, from, sitting, with, their, white, colleagues, upon, learning, that, mcdaniel, had, been, barred, from, the, premiere, clark, gable, threatened, to, boycott, the, event, but, mcdaniel, persuaded, him, to, attend, president, jimmy, carter, later, recalled, it, as, the, biggest, event, to, happen,

formats, upon, its, release, consumer, magazines, and, newspapers, generally, gave, gone, with, the, wind, excellent, reviews, however, while, its, production, values, technical, achievements, and, scale, of, ambition, were, universally, recognized, some, reviewers, of, the, time, found, the, film, to, be, too, long, and, dramatically, unconvincing, frank, s, nugent, for, the, new, york, times, best, summed, up, the, general, sentiment, by, acknowledging, that, while, it, was, the, most, ambitious, film, production, made, up, to, that, point, it, probably, was, not, the, greatest, film, ever, made, but, he, nevertheless, found, it, to, be, an, interesting, story, beautifully, told, franz, hoellering, of, the, nation, was, of, the, same, opinion, the, result, is, a, film, which, is, a, major, event, in, the, history, of, the, industry, but, only, a, minor, achievement, in, motion, picture, art, there, are, moments, when, the, two, categories, meet, on, good, terms, but, the, long, stretches, between, are, filled, with, mere, spectacular, efficiency, while, the, film, was, praised, for, its, fidelity, to, the, novel, this, aspect, was, also, singled, out, as, the, main, factor, contributing, to, the, lengthy, running, time, john, c, flinn, wrote, for, variety, that, selznick, had, left, too, much, in, and, that, as, entertainment, the, film, would, have, benefited, if, repetitious, scenes, and, dialog, from, the, latter, part, of, the, story, had, been, trimmed, the, manchester, guardian, felt, that, the, film, s, one, serious, drawback, was, that, the, story, lacked, the, epic, quality, to, justify, the, outlay, of, time, and, found, the, second, half, which, focuses, on, scarlett, s, irrelevant, marriages, and, domestic, squabbles, mostly, superfluous, and, the, sole, reason, for, their, inclusion, had, been, simply, because, margaret, mitchell, wrote, it, that, way, the, guardian, believed, that, if, the, story, had, been, cut, short, and, tidied, up, at, the, point, marked, by, the, interval, and, if, the, personal, drama, had, been, made, subservient, to, a, cinematic, treatment, of, the, central, theme, the, collapse, and, devastation, of, the, old, south, then, gone, with, the, wind, might, have, been, a, really, great, film, likewise, hoellering, also, found, the, second, half, of, the, film, to, be, weaker, than, the, first, half, identifying, the, civil, war, to, be, the, driving, force, of, the, first, part, while, the, characters, dominate, in, the, second, part, he, concluded, this, is, where, the, main, fault, of, the, film, lay, commenting, that, the, characters, alone, do, not, suffice, despite, many, excellent, scenes, he, considered, the, drama, to, be, unconvincing, and, that, the, psychological, development, had, been, neglected, much, of, the, praise, was, reserved, for, the, casting, with, vivien, leigh, in, particular, being, singled, out, for, her, performance, as, scarlett, nugent, described, her, as, the, pivot, of, the, picture, and, believed, her, to, be, so, perfectly, designed, for, the, part, by, art, and, nature, that, any, other, actress, in, the, role, would, be, inconceivable, similarly, hoellering, found, her, perfect, in, appearance, and, movements, he, felt, her, acting, best, when, she, was, allowed, to, accentuate, the, split, personality, she, portrays, and, thought, she, was, particularly, effective, in, such, moments, of, characterization, like, the, morning, after, the, marital, rape, scene, flinn, also, found, leigh, suited, to, the, role, physically, and, felt, she, was, best, in, the, scenes, where, she, displays, courage, and, determination, such, as, the, escape, from, atlanta, and, when, scarlett, kills, a, yankee, deserter, leigh, won, in, the, best, actress, category, for, her, performance, at, the, 1939, new, york, film, critics, circle, awards, of, clark, gable, s, performance, as, rhett, butler, flinn, felt, the, characterization, was, as, close, to, miss, mitchell, s, conception, and, the, audience, s, as, might, be, imagined, a, view, which, nugent, concurred, with, although, hoellering, felt, that, gable, did, not, quite, convince, in, the, closing, scenes, as, rhett, walks, out, on, scarlett, in, disgust, of, the, other, principal, cast, members, both, hoellering, and, flinn, found, leslie, howard, to, be, convincing, as, the, weak, willed, ashley, with, flinn, identifying, olivia, de, havilland, as, a, standout, as, melanie, nugent, was, also, especially, taken, with, de, havilland, s, performance, describing, it, as, a, gracious, dignified, tender, gem, of, characterization, hattie, mcdaniel, s, performance, as, mammy, was, singled, out, for, praise, by, many, critics, nugent, believed, she, gave, the, best, performance, in, the, film, after, vivien, leigh, with, flinn, placing, it, third, after, leigh, s, and, gable, s, performances, at, the, 12th, academy, awards, gone, with, the, wind, set, a, record, for, academy, award, wins, and, nominations, winning, in, eight, of, the, competitive, categories, it, was, nominated, in, from, a, total, of, thirteen, nominations, it, won, for, best, picture, best, actress, best, supporting, actress, best, director, best, screenplay, best, cinematography, best, art, direction, and, best, editing, and, received, two, further, honorary, awards, for, its, use, of, equipment, and, color, it, also, became, the, first, color, film, to, win, best, picture, the, film, s, record, of, eight, competitive, wins, stood, until, gigi, 1958, won, nine, and, its, overall, record, of, ten, was, broken, by, ben, hur, 1959, which, won, eleven, gone, with, the, wind, also, held, the, record, for, most, nominations, until, all, about, eve, 1950, secured, fourteen, it, was, the, longest, american, sound, film, made, up, to, that, point, and, may, still, hold, the, record, of, the, longest, best, picture, winner, depending, on, how, it, is, interpreted, the, running, time, for, gone, with, the, wind, is, just, under, 221, minutes, while, lawrence, of, arabia, 1962, runs, for, just, over, 222, minutes, however, including, the, overture, intermission, entr, acte, and, exit, music, gone, with, the, wind, lasts, for, 234, minutes, although, some, sources, put, its, full, length, at, 238, minutes, while, lawrence, of, arabia, comes, in, slightly, shorter, at, 232, minutes, with, its, additional, components, hattie, mcdaniel, became, the, first, african, american, to, win, an, academy, award, beating, out, her, co, star, olivia, de, havilland, who, was, also, nominated, in, the, same, category, but, was, racially, segregated, from, her, co, stars, at, the, awards, ceremony, at, the, coconut, grove, she, and, her, escort, were, made, to, sit, at, a, separate, table, at, the, back, of, the, room, meanwhile, screenwriter, sidney, howard, became, the, first, posthumous, oscar, winner, and, selznick, personally, received, the, irving, g, thalberg, memorial, award, for, his, career, achievements, black, commentators, have, criticized, the, film, since, its, release, for, its, depiction, of, black, people, and, whitewashing, of, the, issue, of, slavery, still, initially, newspapers, controlled, by, white, americans, did, not, report, on, these, criticisms, carlton, moss, a, black, dramatist, observed, in, an, open, letter, that, whereas, the, birth, of, a, nation, was, a, frontal, attack, on, american, history, and, the, negro, people, gone, with, the, wind, was, a, rear, attack, on, the, same, he, went, on, to, characterize, it, as, a, nostalgic, plea, for, sympathy, for, a, still, living, cause, of, southern, reaction, moss, further, called, out, the, stereotypical, black, characterizations, such, as, the, shiftless, and, dull, witted, pork, the, indolent, and, thoroughly, irresponsible, prissy, big, sam, s, radiant, acceptance, of, slavery, and, mammy, with, her, constant, haranguing, and, doting, on, every, wish, of, scarlett, similarly, melvin, b, tolson, a, poet, and, educator, wrote, birth, of, a, nation, was, such, a, barefaced, lie, that, a, moron, could, see, through, it, gone, with, the, wind, is, such, a, subtle, lie, that, it, will, be, swallowed, as, truth, by, millions, of, whites, and, blacks, alike, following, hattie, mcdaniel, s, oscar, win, walter, francis, white, leader, of, the, national, association, for, the, advancement, of, colored, people, accused, her, of, being, an, uncle, tom, mcdaniel, responded, that, she, would, rather, make, seven, hundred, dollars, a, week, playing, a, maid, than, seven, dollars, being, one, she, further, questioned, white, s, qualification, to, speak, on, behalf, of, black, people, since, he, was, light, skinned, and, only, one, eighth, black, opinion, in, the, black, community, was, generally, divided, upon, release, with, the, film, being, called, by, some, a, weapon, of, terror, against, black, america, and, an, insult, to, black, audiences, and, demonstrations, were, held, in, various, cities, malcolm, x, later, recalled, that, when, butterfly, mcqueen, went, into, her, act, i, felt, like, crawling, under, the, rug, even, so, some, sections, of, the, black, community, recognized, mcdaniel, s, achievements, to, be, representative, of, progress, some, african, americans, crossed, picket, lines, and, praised, mcdaniel, s, warm, and, witty, characterization, and, others, hoped, that, the, industry, s, recognition, of, her, work, would, lead, to, increased, visibility, on, screen, for, other, black, actors, in, its, editorial, congratulation, to, mcdaniel, on, winning, her, academy, award, opportunity, a, journal, of, negro, life, used, the, film, as, a, reminder, of, the, limit, put, on, black, aspiration, by, old, prejudices, upon, its, release, gone, with, the, wind, broke, attendance, records, everywhere, at, the, capitol, theatre, in, new, york, alone, it, averaged, eleven, thousand, admissions, per, day, in, late, december, and, within, four, years, of, its, release, had, sold, an, estimated, sixty, million, tickets, across, the, united, states, sales, equivalent, to, just, under, half, the, population, at, the, time, it, repeated, its, success, overseas, and, was, a, sensational, hit, during, the, blitz, in, london, opening, in, april, 1940, and, playing, for, four, years, at, the, little, ritz, in, leicester, square, by, the, time, mgm, withdrew, it, from, circulation, at, the, end, of, 1943, its, worldwide, distribution, had, returned, a, gross, rental, the, studio, s, share, of, the, box, office, gross, of, 32, million, making, it, the, most, profitable, film, ever, made, up, to, that, point, it, eventually, opened, in, japan, in, september, 1952, and, became, the, highest, grossing, foreign, film, there, even, though, it, earned, its, investors, roughly, twice, as, much, as, the, previous, record, holder, the, birth, of, a, nation, the, box, office, performances, of, the, two, films, were, likely, much, closer, the, bulk, of, the, earnings, from, gone, with, the, wind, came, from, its, roadshow, and, first, run, engagements, where, the, distributor, received, 70, percent, and, 50, percent, of, the, box, office, gross, respectively, rather, than, its, general, release, which, at, the, time, typically, saw, the, distributor, s, share, set, at, 30, 35, percent, of, the, gross, in, the, case, of, the, birth, of, a, nation, its, distributor, epoch, sold, off, many, of, its, distribution, territories, on, a, states, rights, basis, which, typically, amounted, to, 10, percent, of, the, box, office, gross, and, epoch, s, accounts, are, only, indicative, of, its, own, profits, from, the, film, and, not, the, local, distributors, carl, e, milliken, secretary, of, the, motion, picture, producers, and, distributors, association, estimated, that, the, birth, of, a, nation, had, been, seen, by, fifty, million, people, by, 1930, when, re, released, in, 1947, it, earned, a, 5, million, rental, in, the, united, states, and, canada, and, was, one, of, the, year, s, top, ten, releases, successful, re, releases, in, 1954, and, 1961, enabled, it, to, retain, its, position, as, the, industry, s, top, earner, despite, substantial, challenges, from, more, recent, films, such, as, ben, hur, but, it, was, finally, overtaken, by, the, sound, of, music, in, 1966, the, 1967, reissue, was, unusual, because, mgm, chose, to, roadshow, it, which, turned, it, into, the, most, successful, re, release, in, the, industry, s, history, it, generated, a, box, office, gross, of, 68, million, making, it, mgm, s, most, lucrative, film, after, doctor, zhivago, from, the, latter, half, of, the, decade, mgm, earned, a, rental, of, 41, million, from, the, release, with, the, u, s, and, canadian, share, amounting, to, over, 30, million, placing, it, second, only, to, the, graduate, for, that, year, including, its, 6, 7, million, rental, from, the, 1961, reissue, it, was, the, fourth, highest, earner, of, the, decade, in, the, north, american, market, with, only, the, sound, of, music, the, graduate, and, doctor, zhivago, making, more, for, their, distributors, a, further, re, release, in, 1971, allowed, it, to, briefly, recapture, the, record, from, the, sound, of, music, bringing, its, total, worldwide, gross, rental, to, about, 116, million, by, the, end, of, 1971, more, than, trebling, its, earnings, from, its, initial, release, before, losing, the, record, again, the, following, year, to, the, godfather, across, all, releases, it, is, estimated, that, gone, with, the, wind, has, sold, over, 200, million, tickets, in, the, united, states, and, canada, generating, more, theater, admissions, in, that, territory, than, any, other, film, the, film, was, phenomenally, successful, in, western, europe, too, generating, approximately, 35, million, tickets, in, the, united, kingdom, and, over, 16, million, in, france, respectively, becoming, the, biggest, and, sixth, biggest, ticket, sellers, in, those, markets, the, film, s, appeal, has, endured, overseas, sustaining, a, popularity, similar, to, its, domestic, longevity, in, 1975, it, played, to, capacity, audiences, every, night, during, the, first, three, weeks, of, its, run, at, london, s, plaza, 2, theatre, and, in, japan, it, generated, over, half, a, million, admissions, at, twenty, theaters, during, a, five, week, engagement, in, total, gone, with, the, wind, has, grossed, over, 390, million, globally, at, the, box, office, in, 2007, turner, entertainment, estimated, the, gross, to, be, equivalent, to, approximately, 3, 3, billion, when, adjusted, for, inflation, to, current, prices, guinness, world, records, arrived, at, a, figure, of, 3, 44, billion, in, 2014, making, it, the, most, successful, film, in, cinema, history, the, film, remains, immensely, popular, with, audiences, into, the, 21st, century, having, been, voted, the, most, popular, film, in, two, nationwide, polls, of, americans, undertaken, by, harris, interactive, in, 2008, and, again, in, 2014, the, market, research, firm, surveyed, over, two, thousand, u, s, adults, with, the, results, weighted, by, age, sex, race, ethnicity, education, region, and, household, income, so, their, proportions, matched, the, composition, of, the, adult, population, american, film, institute, when, revisiting, the, film, in, the, 1970s, arthur, m, schlesinger, jr, believed, that, hollywood, films, generally, age, well, revealing, an, unexpected, depth, or, integrity, but, in, the, case, of, gone, with, the, wind, time, has, not, treated, it, kindly, richard, schickel, argued, that, one, measure, of, a, film, s, quality, is, to, ask, what, the, viewer, can, remember, of, it, and, the, film, falls, down, in, this, regard, unforgettable, imagery, and, dialogue, are, simply, not, present, stanley, kauffmann, likewise, also, found, the, film, to, be, a, largely, forgettable, experience, claiming, he, could, only, remember, two, scenes, vividly, both, schickel, and, schlesinger, put, this, down, to, it, being, badly, written, in, turn, describing, the, dialogue, as, flowery, and, possessing, a, picture, postcard, sensibility, schickel, also, believes, the, film, fails, as, popular, art, in, that, it, has, limited, rewatch, value, a, sentiment, that, kauffmann, also, concurs, with, stating, that, having, watched, it, twice, he, hopes, never, to, see, it, again, twice, is, twice, as, much, as, any, lifetime, needs, both, schickel, and, andrew, sarris, identify, the, film, s, main, failing, is, in, possessing, a, producer, s, sensibility, rather, than, an, artistic, one, having, gone, through, so, many, directors, and, writers, the, film, does, not, carry, a, sense, of, being, created, or, directed, but, rather, having, emerged, steaming, from, the, crowded, kitchen, where, the, main, creative,

half, of, the, film, does, have, a, sweep, and, vigor, that, aspire, to, its, epic, theme, but, agreed, with, criticisms, of, the, personal, lives, taking, over, in, the, second, half, and, how, it,

as, defending, traditional, values, and, the, issue, of, slavery, is, largely, ignored, the, film, has, been, described, as, a, regression, that, promotes, both, the, myth, of, the, black, rapist, and, the, honorable, and, defensive, role, of, the, ku, klux, klan, during, reconstruction, and, as, a, social, propaganda, film, offering, a, white, supremacist, view, of, the, past, from, 1972, to,

a, result, it, concluded, that, the, happy, darky, was, a, myth, as, was, the, belief, that, all, slaves, experienced, violence, and, brutality, w, bryan, rommel, ruiz, has, argued, that, despite, factual, inaccuracies, in, depicting, the, reconstruction, period, gone, with, the, wind, reflects, contemporary, interpretations, of, it, that, were, common, in, the, early, 20th, century, one, such, viewpoint, is, reflected, in, a, brief, scene, in, which, mammy, fends, off, a, leering, freedman, a, politician, can, be, heard, offering, forty, acres, and, a, mule, to, the, emancipated, slaves, in, exchange, for, their, votes, the, inference, is, taken, to, mean, that, freedmen, are, ignorant, about, politics, and, unprepared, for, freedom, unwittingly, becoming, the, tools, of, corrupt,

the, birth, of, a, nation, it, unleashed, a, variety, of, social, forces, that, foreshadowed, an, alliance, of, white, liberals, and, black, people, who, encouraged, the, expectation, that, black, people, would, one, day, achieve, equality, according, to, cripps, the, film, eventually, became, a, template, for, measuring, social, change, in, the, 21st, century, criticism, of, the, film, s,

product, of, its, time, and, as, a, result, it, depicted, ethnic, and, racial, prejudices, that, were, wrong, then, and, are, wrong, today, it, was, also, announced, that, the, film, would, return, to, the, streaming, service, at, a, later, date, although, it, would, incorporate, a, discussion, of, its, historical, context, and, a, denouncement, of, those, very, depictions, but, will, be, presented, as, it, was, originally, created, because, to, do, otherwise, would, be, the, same, as, claiming, these, prejudices, never, existed, if, we, are, to, create, a, more, just, equitable, and,

film, in, an, op, ed, for, cnn, as, a, prime, text, for, examining, expressions, of, white, supremacy, in, popular, culture, and, said, that, it, is, precisely, because, of, the, ongoing, painful, patterns, of, racial, injustice, and, disregard, for, black, lives, that, gone, with, the, wind, should, stay, in, circulation, and, remain, available, for, viewing, analysis, and, discussion, she,

following, morning, shows, scarlett, glowing, with, barely, suppressed, sexual, satisfaction, rhett, apologizes, for, his, behavior, blaming, it, on, his, drinking, the, scene, has, been, accused, of, combining, romance, and, rape, by, making, them, indistinguishable, from, each, other, and, of, reinforcing, a, notion, about, forced, sex, that, women, secretly, enjoy, it, and, it, is, an, acceptable, way, for, a, man, to, treat, his, wife, film, critic, molly, haskell, has, argued, that, nevertheless, for, women, who, are, uncritical, of, the, scene, it, is, by, and, large, consistent, with, what, they, have, in, mind, if, they, fantasize, about, being, raped, their, fantasies, revolve, around, love, and, romance, rather, than, forced, sex, they, will, assume, that, scarlett, was,

focusing, on, scarlett, s, divorce, from, rhett, mgm, was, not, satisfied, with, the, story, and, the, deal, collapsed, the, idea, was, revived, in, the, 1990s, when, a, sequel, was, finally,

is, a, good, job, and, he, feels, the, present, job, is, not, right, for, days, he, told, me, he, has, looked, at, the, rushes, and, felt, he, was, failing, the, thing, did, not, click, as, it, should, gradually, he, became, convinced, that, the, script, was, the, trouble, david, himself, thinks, he, is, writing, the, script, and, george, has, continually, taken, script, from, day, to, day, compared, the, garrett, selznick, version, with, the, howard, groaned, and, tried, to, change, some, parts, back, to, the, howard, script, but, he, seldom, could, do, much, with, the, scene, so, george, just, told, david, he, would, not, work, any, longer, if, the, script, was, not, better, and, he, wanted, the, howard, script, back, david, told, george, he, was, a, director, not, an, author, and, he, david, was, the, producer, and, the, judge, of, what, is, a, good, script, george, said, he, was, a, director, and, a, damn, good, one, and, he, would, not, let, his, name, go, out, over, a, lousy, picture, and, bull, headed, david, said, ok, get, out
