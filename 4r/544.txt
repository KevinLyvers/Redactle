landscape, painting, also, known, as, landscape, art, is, the, depiction, in, painting, of, natural, scenery, such, as, mountains, valleys, rivers, trees, and, forests, especially, where, the, main, subject, is, a, wide, view, with, its, elements, arranged, into, a, coherent, composition, in, other, works, landscape, backgrounds, for, figures, can, still, form, an, important, part, of, the, work, sky, is, almost, always, included, in, the, view, and, weather, is, often, an, element, of, the, composition, detailed, landscapes, as, a, distinct, subject, are, not, found, in, all, artistic, traditions, and, develop, when, there, is, already, a, sophisticated, tradition, of, representing, other, subjects, two, main, traditions, spring, from, western, painting, and, chinese, art, going, back, well, over, a, thousand, years, in, both, cases, the, recognition, of, a, spiritual, element, in, landscape, art, is, present, from, its, beginnings, in, east, asian, art, drawing, on, daoism, and, other, philosophical, traditions, but, in, the, west, only, becomes, explicit, with, romanticism, landscape, views, in, art, may, be, entirely, imaginary, or, copied, from, reality, with, varying, degrees, of, accuracy, if, the, primary, purpose, of, a, picture, is, to, depict, an, actual, specific, place, especially, including, buildings, prominently, it, is, called, a, topographical, view, such, views, extremely, common, as, prints, in, the, west, are, often, seen, as, inferior, to, fine, art, landscapes, although, the, distinction, is, not, always, meaningful, similar, prejudices, existed, in, chinese, art, where, literati, painting, usually, depicted, imaginary, views, while, professional, artists, painted, real, views, the, word, landscape, entered, the, modern, english, language, as, landskip, variously, spelt, an, anglicization, of, the, dutch, landschap, around, the, start, of, the, 17th, century, purely, as, a, term, for, works, of, art, with, its, first, use, as, a, word, for, a, painting, in, 1598, within, a, few, decades, it, was, used, to, describe, vistas, in, poetry, and, eventually, as, a, term, for, real, views, however, the, cognate, term, landscaef, or, landskipe, for, a, cleared, patch, of, land, had, existed, in, old, english, though, it, is, not, recorded, from, middle, english, the, earliest, forms, of, art, around, the, world, depict, little, that, could, really, be, called, landscape, although, ground, lines, and, sometimes, indications, of, mountains, trees, or, other, natural, features, are, included, the, earliest, pure, landscapes, with, no, human, figures, are, frescos, from, minoan, art, of, around, 1500, bce, hunting, scenes, especially, those, set, in, the, enclosed, vista, of, the, reed, beds, of, the, nile, delta, from, ancient, egypt, can, give, a, strong, sense, of, place, but, the, emphasis, is, on, individual, plant, forms, and, human, and, animal, figures, rather, than, the, overall, landscape, setting, the, frescos, from, the, tomb, of, nebamun, now, in, the, british, museum, c, 1350, bc, are, a, famous, example, for, a, coherent, depiction, of, a, whole, landscape, some, rough, system, of, perspective, or, scaling, for, distance, is, needed, and, this, seems, from, literary, evidence, to, have, first, been, developed, in, ancient, greece, in, the, hellenistic, period, although, no, large, scale, examples, survive, more, ancient, roman, landscapes, survive, from, the, 1st, century, bce, onwards, especially, frescos, of, landscapes, decorating, rooms, that, have, been, preserved, at, archaeological, sites, of, pompeii, herculaneum, and, elsewhere, and, mosaics, the, chinese, ink, painting, tradition, of, shan, shui, mountain, water, or, pure, landscape, in, which, the, only, sign, of, human, life, is, usually, a, sage, or, a, glimpse, of, his, hut, uses, sophisticated, landscape, backgrounds, to, figure, subjects, and, landscape, art, of, this, period, retains, a, classic, and, much, imitated, status, within, the, chinese, tradition, both, the, roman, and, chinese, traditions, typically, show, grand, panoramas, of, imaginary, landscapes, generally, backed, with, a, range, of, spectacular, mountains, in, china, often, with, waterfalls, and, in, rome, often, including, sea, lakes, or, rivers, these, were, frequently, used, as, in, the, example, illustrated, to, bridge, the, gap, between, a, foreground, scene, with, figures, and, a, distant, panoramic, vista, a, persistent, problem, for, landscape, artists, the, chinese, style, generally, showed, only, a, distant, view, or, used, dead, ground, or, mist, to, avoid, that, difficulty, a, major, contrast, between, landscape, painting, in, the, west, and, east, asia, has, been, that, while, in, the, west, until, the, 19th, century, it, occupied, a, low, position, in, the, accepted, hierarchy, of, genres, in, east, asia, the, classic, chinese, mountain, water, ink, painting, was, traditionally, the, most, prestigious, form, of, visual, art, aesthetic, theories, in, both, regions, gave, the, highest, status, to, the, works, seen, to, require, the, most, imagination, from, the, artist, in, the, west, this, was, history, painting, but, in, east, asia, it, was, the, imaginary, landscape, where, famous, practitioners, were, at, least, in, theory, amateur, literati, including, several, emperors, of, both, china, and, japan, they, were, often, also, poets, whose, lines, and, images, illustrated, each, other, however, in, the, west, history, painting, came, to, require, an, extensive, landscape, background, where, appropriate, so, the, theory, did, not, entirely, work, against, the, development, of, landscape, painting, for, several, centuries, landscapes, were, regularly, promoted, to, the, status, of, history, painting, by, the, addition, of, small, figures, to, make, a, narrative, scene, typically, religious, or, mythological, in, early, western, medieval, art, interest, in, landscape, disappears, almost, entirely, kept, alive, only, in, copies, of, late, antique, works, such, as, the, utrecht, psalter, the, last, reworking, of, this, source, in, an, early, gothic, version, reduces, the, previously, extensive, landscapes, to, a, few, trees, filling, gaps, in, the, composition, with, no, sense, of, overall, space, a, revival, in, interest, in, nature, initially, mainly, manifested, itself, in, depictions, of, small, gardens, such, as, the, hortus, conclusus, or, those, in, millefleur, tapestries, the, frescos, of, figures, at, work, or, play, in, front, of, a, background, of, dense, trees, in, the, palace, of, the, popes, avignon, are, probably, a, unique, survival, of, what, was, a, common, subject, several, frescos, of, gardens, have, survived, from, roman, houses, like, the, villa, of, livia, during, the, 14th, century, giotto, di, bondone, and, his, followers, began, to, acknowledge, nature, in, their, work, increasingly, introducing, elements, of, the, landscape, as, the, background, setting, for, the, action, of, the, figures, in, their, paintings, early, in, the, 15th, century, landscape, painting, was, established, as, a, genre, in, europe, as, a, setting, for, human, activity, often, expressed, in, a, religious, subject, such, as, the, themes, of, the, rest, on, the, flight, into, egypt, the, journey, of, the, magi, or, saint, jerome, in, the, desert, luxury, illuminated, manuscripts, were, very, important, in, the, early, development, of, landscape, especially, series, of, the, labours, of, the, months, such, as, those, in, the, tr, s, riches, heures, du, duc, de, berry, which, conventionally, showed, small, genre, figures, in, increasingly, large, landscape, settings, a, particular, advance, is, shown, in, the, less, well, known, turin, milan, hours, now, largely, destroyed, by, fire, whose, developments, were, reflected, in, early, netherlandish, painting, for, the, rest, of, the, century, the, artist, known, as, hand, g, probably, one, of, the, van, eyck, brothers, was, especially, successful, in, reproducing, effects, of, light, and, in, a, natural, seeming, progression, from, the, foreground, to, the, distant, view, this, was, something, other, artists, were, to, find, difficult, for, a, century, or, more, often, solving, the, problem, by, showing, a, landscape, background, from, over, the, top, of, a, parapet, or, window, sill, as, if, from, a, considerable, height, landscape, backgrounds, for, various, types, of, painting, became, increasingly, prominent, and, skillful, during, the, 15th, century, the, period, around, the, end, of, the, 15th, century, saw, pure, landscape, drawings, and, watercolours, from, leonardo, da, vinci, albrecht, d, rer, fra, bartolomeo, and, others, but, pure, landscape, subjects, in, painting, and, printmaking, still, small, were, first, produced, by, albrecht, altdorfer, and, others, of, the, german, danube, school, in, the, early, 16th, century, however, the, outsides, of, the, wings, of, a, triptych, by, gerard, david, dated, to, about, 1510, 15, are, the, earliest, from, the, low, countries, and, possibly, in, europe, at, the, same, time, joachim, patinir, in, the, netherlands, developed, the, world, landscape, a, style, of, panoramic, landscape, with, small, figures, and, using, a, high, aerial, viewpoint, that, remained, influential, for, a, century, being, used, and, perfected, by, pieter, brueghel, the, elder, the, italian, development, of, a, thorough, system, of, graphical, perspective, was, now, known, all, over, europe, which, allowed, large, and, complex, views, to, be, painted, very, effectively, landscapes, were, idealized, mostly, reflecting, a, pastoral, ideal, drawn, from, classical, poetry, which, was, first, fully, expressed, by, giorgione, and, the, young, titian, and, remained, associated, above, all, with, hilly, wooded, italian, landscape, which, was, depicted, by, artists, from, northern, europe, who, had, never, visited, italy, just, as, plain, dwelling, literati, in, china, and, japan, painted, vertiginous, mountains, though, often, young, artists, were, encouraged, to, visit, italy, to, experience, italian, light, many, northern, european, artists, could, make, their, living, selling, italianate, landscapes, without, ever, bothering, to, make, the, trip, indeed, certain, styles, were, so, popular, that, they, became, formulas, that, could, be, copied, again, and, again, the, publication, in, antwerp, in, 1559, and, 1561, of, two, series, of, a, total, of, 48, prints, the, small, landscapes, after, drawings, by, an, anonymous, artist, referred, to, as, the, master, of, the, small, landscapes, signaled, a, shift, away, from, the, imaginary, distant, landscapes, with, religious, content, of, the, world, landscape, towards, close, up, renderings, at, eye, level, of, identifiable, country, estates, and, villages, populated, with, figures, engaged, in, daily, activities, by, abandoning, the, panoramic, viewpoint, of, the, world, landscape, and, focusing, on, the, humble, rural, and, even, topographical, the, small, landscapes, set, the, stage, for, netherlandish, landscape, painting, in, the, 17th, century, after, the, publication, of, the, small, landscapes, landscape, artists, in, the, low, countries, either, continued, with, the, world, landscape, or, followed, the, new, mode, presented, by, the, small, landscapes, the, popularity, of, exotic, landscape, scenes, can, be, seen, in, the, success, of, the, painter, frans, post, who, spent, the, rest, of, his, life, painting, brazilian, landscapes, after, a, trip, there, in, 1636, 1644, other, painters, who, never, crossed, the, alps, could, make, money, selling, rhineland, landscapes, and, still, others, for, constructing, fantasy, scenes, for, a, particular, commission, such, as, cornelis, de, man, s, view, of, smeerenburg, in, 1639, compositional, formulae, using, elements, like, the, repoussoir, were, evolved, which, remain, influential, in, modern, photography, and, painting, notably, by, poussin, and, claude, lorrain, both, french, artists, living, in, 17th, century, rome, and, painting, largely, classical, subject, matter, or, biblical, scenes, set, in, the, same, landscapes, unlike, their, dutch, contemporaries, italian, and, french, landscape, artists, still, most, often, wanted, to, keep, their, classification, within, the, hierarchy, of, genres, as, history, painting, by, including, small, figures, to, represent, a, scene, from, classical, mythology, or, the, bible, salvator, rosa, gave, picturesque, excitement, to, his, landscapes, by, showing, wilder, southern, italian, country, often, populated, by, banditi, dutch, golden, age, painting, of, the, 17th, century, saw, the, dramatic, growth, of, landscape, painting, in, which, many, artists, specialized, and, the, development, of, extremely, subtle, realist, techniques, for, depicting, light, and, weather, there, are, different, styles, and, periods, and, sub, genres, of, marine, and, animal, painting, as, well, as, a, distinct, style, of, italianate, landscape, most, dutch, landscapes, were, relatively, small, but, landscapes, in, flemish, baroque, painting, still, usually, peopled, were, often, very, large, above, all, in, the, series, of, works, that, peter, paul, rubens, painted, for, his, own, houses, landscape, prints, were, also, popular, with, those, of, rembrandt, and, the, experimental, works, of, hercules, seghers, usually, considered, the, finest, the, dutch, tended, to, make, smaller, paintings, for, smaller, houses, some, dutch, landscape, specialties, named, in, period, inventories, include, the, batalje, or, battle, scene, the, maneschijntje, or, moonlight, scene, the, bosjes, or, woodland, scene, the, boederijtje, or, farm, scene, and, the, dorpje, or, village, scene, though, not, named, at, the, time, as, a, specific, genre, the, popularity, of, roman, ruins, inspired, many, dutch, landscape, painters, of, the, period, to, paint, the, ruins, of, their, own, region, such, as, monasteries, and, churches, ruined, after, the, beeldenstorm, jacob, van, ruisdael, is, considered, the, most, versatile, of, all, dutch, golden, age, landscape, painters, the, popularity, of, landscapes, in, the, netherlands, was, in, part, a, reflection, of, the, virtual, disappearance, of, religious, painting, in, a, calvinist, society, and, the, decline, of, religious, painting, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, all, over, europe, combined, with, romanticism, to, give, landscapes, a, much, greater, and, more, prestigious, place, in, 19th, century, art, than, they, had, assumed, before, in, england, landscapes, had, initially, been, mostly, backgrounds, to, portraits, typically, suggesting, the, parks, or, estates, of, a, landowner, though, mostly, painted, in, london, by, an, artist, who, had, never, visited, his, sitter, s, rolling, acres, the, english, tradition, was, founded, by, anthony, van, dyck, and, other, mostly, flemish, artists, working, in, england, but, in, the, 18th, century, the, works, of, claude, lorrain, were, keenly, collected, and, influenced, not, only, paintings, of, landscapes, but, the, english, landscape, gardens, of, capability, brown, and, others, in, the, 18th, century, watercolour, painting, mostly, of, landscapes, became, an, english, specialty, with, both, a, buoyant, market, for, professional, works, and, a, large, number, of, amateur, painters, many, following, the, popular, systems, found, in, the, books, of, alexander, cozens, and, others, by, the, beginning, of, the, 19th, century, the, english, artists, with, the, highest, modern, reputations, were, mostly, dedicated, landscape, painters, showing, the, wide, range, of, romantic, interpretations, of, the, english, landscape, found, in, the, works, of, john, constable, j, m, w, turner, and, samuel, palmer, however, all, these, had, difficulty, establishing, themselves, in, the, contemporary, art, market, which, still, preferred, history, paintings, and, portraits, in, europe, as, john, ruskin, said, and, sir, kenneth, clark, confirmed, landscape, painting, was, the, chief, artistic, creation, of, the, nineteenth, century, and, the, dominant, art, with, the, result, that, in, the, following, period, people, were, apt, to, assume, that, the, appreciation, of, natural, beauty, and, the, painting, of, landscape, is, a, normal, and, enduring, part, of, our, spiritual, activity, in, clark, s, analysis, underlying, european, ways, to, convert, the, complexity, of, landscape, to, an, idea, were, four, fundamental, approaches, the, acceptance, of, descriptive, symbols, a, curiosity, about, the, facts, of, nature, the, creation, of, fantasy, to, allay, deep, rooted, fears, of, nature, and, the, belief, in, a, golden, age, of, harmony, and, order, which, might, be, retrieved, the, 18th, century, was, also, a, great, age, for, the, topographical, print, depicting, more, or, less, accurately, a, real, view, in, a, way, that, landscape, painting, rarely, did, initially, these, were, mostly, centred, on, a, building, but, over, the, course, of, the, century, with, the, growth, of, the, romantic, movement, pure, landscapes, became, more, common, the, topographical, print, often, intended, to, be, framed, and, hung, on, a, wall, remained, a, very, popular, medium, into, the, 20th, century, but, was, often, classed, as, a, lower, form, of, art, than, an, imagined, landscape, landscapes, in, watercolour, on, paper, became, a, distinct, specialism, above, all, in, england, where, a, particular, tradition, of, talented, artists, who, only, or, almost, entirely, painted, landscape, watercolours, developed, as, it, did, not, in, other, countries, these, were, very, often, real, views, though, sometimes, the, compositions, were, adjusted, for, artistic, effect, the, paintings, sold, relatively, cheaply, but, were, far, quicker, to, produce, these, professionals, could, augment, their, income, by, training, the, armies, of, amateurs, who, also, painted, leading, artists, included, john, robert, cozens, francis, towne, thomas, girtin, michael, angelo, rooker, william, pars, thomas, hearne, and, john, warwick, smith, all, in, the, late, 18th, century, and, john, glover, joseph, mallord, william, turner, john, varley, john, sell, cotman, anthony, copley, fielding, samuel, palmer, in, the, early, 19th, the, romantic, movement, intensified, the, existing, interest, in, landscape, art, and, remote, and, wild, landscapes, which, had, been, one, recurring, element, in, earlier, landscape, art, now, became, more, prominent, the, german, caspar, david, friedrich, had, a, distinctive, style, influenced, by, his, danish, training, where, a, distinct, national, style, drawing, on, the, dutch, 17th, century, example, had, developed, to, this, he, added, a, quasi, mystical, romanticism, french, painters, were, slower, to, develop, landscape, painting, but, from, about, the, 1830s, jean, baptiste, camille, corot, and, other, painters, in, the, barbizon, school, established, a, french, landscape, tradition, that, would, become, the, most, influential, in, europe, for, a, century, with, the, impressionists, and, post, impressionists, for, the, first, time, making, landscape, painting, the, main, source, of, general, stylistic, innovation, across, all, types, of, painting, the, nationalism, of, the, new, united, provinces, had, been, a, factor, in, the, popularity, of, dutch, 17th, century, landscape, painting, and, in, the, 19th, century, as, other, nations, attempted, to, develop, distinctive, national, schools, of, painting, the, attempt, to, express, the, special, nature, of, the, landscape, of, the, homeland, became, a, general, tendency, in, russia, as, in, america, the, gigantic, size, of, paintings, was, itself, a, nationalist, statement, in, poland, the, main, representatives, of, landscape, painting, in, the, second, part, of, the, 19th, century, were, maksymilian, gierymski, j, zef, che, mo, ski, and, stanis, aw, mas, owski, in, spain, the, main, promoter, of, the, genre, was, the, belgium, born, painter, carlos, de, haes, one, of, the, most, active, landscape, professors, at, the, academy, of, fine, arts, of, san, fernando, in, madrid, since, 1857, after, studying, with, the, great, flemish, landscape, masters, he, developed, his, technique, to, paint, outdoors, back, in, spain, haes, took, his, students, with, him, to, paint, in, the, countryside, under, his, teaching, the, painters, proliferated, and, took, advantage, of, the, new, railway, system, to, explore, the, furthest, corners, of, the, nation, s, topography, in, the, united, states, the, hudson, river, school, prominent, in, the, middle, to, late, 19th, century, is, probably, the, best, known, native, development, in, landscape, art, these, painters, created, works, of, mammoth, scale, that, attempted, to, capture, the, epic, scope, of, the, landscapes, that, inspired, them, the, work, of, thomas, cole, the, school, s, generally, acknowledged, founder, has, much, in, common, with, the, philosophical, ideals, of, european, landscape, paintings, a, kind, of, secular, faith, in, the, spiritual, benefits, to, be, gained, from, the, contemplation, of, natural, beauty, some, of, the, later, hudson, river, school, artists, such, as, albert, bierstadt, created, less, comforting, works, that, placed, a, greater, emphasis, with, a, great, deal, of, romantic, exaggeration, on, the, raw, even, terrifying, power, of, nature, frederic, edwin, church, a, student, of, cole, synthesized, the, ideas, of, his, contemporaries, with, those, of, european, old, masters, and, the, writings, of, john, ruskin, and, alexander, von, humboldt, to, become, the, foremost, american, landscape, painter, of, the, century, the, best, examples, of, canadian, landscape, art, can, be, found, in, the, works, of, the, group, of, seven, prominent, in, the, 1920s, although, certainly, less, dominant, in, the, period, after, world, war, i, many, significant, artists, still, painted, landscapes, in, the, wide, variety, of, styles, exemplified, by, edvard, munch, georgia, o, keeffe, charles, e, burchfield, neil, welliver, alex, katz, milton, avery, peter, doig, andrew, wyeth, david, hockney, and, sidney, nolan, landscape, painting, has, been, called, china, s, greatest, contribution, to, the, art, of, the, world, and, owes, its, special, character, to, the, taoist, daoist, tradition, in, chinese, culture, william, watson, notes, that, it, has, been, said, that, the, role, of, landscape, art, in, chinese, painting, corresponds, to, that, of, the, nude, in, the, west, as, a, theme, unvarying, in, itself, but, made, the, vehicle, of, infinite, nuances, of, vision, and, feeling, there, are, increasingly, sophisticated, landscape, backgrounds, to, figure, subjects, showing, hunting, farming, or, animals, from, the, han, dynasty, onwards, with, surviving, examples, mostly, in, stone, or, clay, reliefs, from, tombs, which, are, presumed, to, follow, the, prevailing, styles, in, painting, no, doubt, without, capturing, the, full, effect, of, the, original, paintings, the, exact, status, of, the, later, copies, of, reputed, works, by, famous, painters, many, of, whom, are, recorded, in, literature, before, the, 10th, century, is, unclear, one, example, is, a, famous, 8th, century, painting, from, the, imperial, collection, titled, the, emperor, ming, huang, traveling, in, shu, this, shows, the, entourage, riding, through, vertiginous, mountains, of, the, type, typical, of, later, paintings, but, is, in, full, colour, producing, an, overall, pattern, that, is, almost, persian, in, what, was, evidently, a, popular, and, fashionable, court, style, the, decisive, shift, to, a, monochrome, landscape, style, almost, devoid, of, figures, is, attributed, to, wang, wei, 699, 759, also, famous, as, a, poet, mostly, only, copies, of, his, works, survive, from, the, 10th, century, onwards, an, increasing, number, of, original, paintings, survive, and, the, best, works, of, the, song, dynasty, 960, 1279, southern, school, remain, among, the, most, highly, regarded, in, what, has, been, an, uninterrupted, tradition, to, the, present, day, chinese, convention, valued, the, paintings, of, the, amateur, scholar, gentleman, often, a, poet, as, well, over, those, produced, by, professionals, though, the, situation, was, more, complex, than, that, if, they, include, any, figures, they, are, very, often, such, persons, or, sages, contemplating, the, mountains, famous, works, have, accumulated, numbers, of, red, appreciation, seals, and, often, poems, added, by, later, owners, the, qianlong, emperor, 1711, 1799, was, a, prolific, adder, of, his, own, poems, following, earlier, emperors, the, shan, shui, tradition, was, never, intended, to, represent, actual, locations, even, when, named, after, them, as, in, the, convention, of, the, eight, views, a, different, style, produced, by, workshops, of, professional, court, artists, painted, official, views, of, imperial, tours, and, ceremonies, with, the, primary, emphasis, on, highly, detailed, scenes, of, crowded, cities, and, grand, ceremonials, from, a, high, viewpoint, these, were, painted, on, scrolls, of, enormous, length, in, bright, colour, example, below, chinese, sculpture, also, achieves, the, difficult, feat, of, creating, effective, landscapes, in, three, dimensions, there, is, a, long, tradition, of, the, appreciation, of, viewing, stones, naturally, formed, boulders, typically, limestone, from, the, banks, of, mountain, rivers, that, has, been, eroded, into, fantastic, shapes, were, transported, to, the, courtyards, and, gardens, of, the, literati, probably, associated, with, these, is, the, tradition, of, carving, much, smaller, boulders, of, jade, or, some, other, semi, precious, stone, into, the, shape, of, a, mountain, including, tiny, figures, of, monks, or, sages, chinese, gardens, also, developed, a, highly, sophisticated, aesthetic, much, earlier, than, those, in, the, west, the, karensansui, or, japanese, dry, garden, of, zen, buddhism, takes, the, garden, even, closer, to, being, a, work, of, sculpture, representing, a, highly, abstracted, landscape, japanese, art, initially, adapted, chinese, styles, to, reflect, their, interest, in, narrative, themes, in, art, with, scenes, set, in, landscapes, mixing, with, those, showing, palace, or, city, scenes, using, the, same, high, view, point, cutting, away, roofs, as, necessary, these, appeared, in, the, very, long, yamato, e, scrolls, of, scenes, illustrating, the, tale, of, genji, and, other, subjects, mostly, from, the, 12th, and, 13th, centuries, the, concept, of, the, gentleman, amateur, painter, had, little, resonance, in, feudal, japan, where, artists, were, generally, professionals, with, a, strong, bond, to, their, master, and, his, school, rather, than, the, classic, artists, from, the, distant, past, from, which, chinese, painters, tended, to, draw, their, inspiration, painting, was, initially, fully, coloured, often, brightly, so, and, the, landscape, never, overwhelms, the, figures, who, are, often, rather, oversized, the, scene, from, the, biography, of, the, priest, ippen, illustrated, below, is, from, a, scroll, that, in, full, measures, 37, 8, cm, 802, 0, cm, for, only, one, of, twelve, scrolls, illustrating, the, life, of, a, buddhist, monk, like, their, western, counterparts, monasteries, and, temples, commissioned, many, such, works, and, these, have, had, a, better, chance, of, survival, than, courtly, equivalents, even, rarer, are, survivals, of, landscape, by, bu, folding, screens, and, hanging, scrolls, which, seem, to, have, common, in, court, circles, the, tale, of, genji, has, an, episode, where, members, of, the, court, produce, the, best, paintings, from, their, collections, for, a, competition, these, were, closer, to, chinese, shan, shui, but, still, fully, coloured, many, more, pure, landscape, subjects, survive, from, the, 15th, century, onwards, several, key, artists, are, zen, buddhist, clergy, and, worked, in, a, monochrome, style, with, greater, emphasis, on, brush, strokes, in, the, chinese, manner, some, schools, adopted, a, less, refined, style, with, smaller, views, giving, greater, emphasis, to, the, foreground, a, type, of, image, that, had, an, enduring, appeal, for, japanese, artists, and, came, to, be, called, the, japanese, style, is, in, fact, first, found, in, china, this, combines, one, or, more, large, birds, animals, or, trees, in, the, foreground, typically, to, one, side, in, a, horizontal, composition, with, a, wider, landscape, beyond, often, only, covering, portions, of, the, background, later, versions, of, this, style, often, dispensed, with, a, landscape, background, altogether, the, ukiyo, e, style, that, developed, from, the, 16th, century, onwards, first, in, painting, and, then, in, coloured, woodblock, prints, that, were, cheap, and, widely, available, initially, concentrated, on, the, human, figure, individually, and, in, groups, but, from, the, late, 18th, century, landscape, ukiyo, e, developed, under, hokusai, and, hiroshige, to, become, much, the, best, known, type, of, japanese, landscape, art, though, there, are, some, landscape, elements, in, earlier, art, the, landscape, tradition, of, the, persian, miniature, really, begins, in, the, ilkhanid, period, largely, under, chinese, influence, rocky, mountainous, country, is, preferred, which, is, shown, full, of, animals, and, plants, which, are, carefully, and, individually, depicted, as, are, rock, formations, the, particular, convention, of, the, elevated, viewpoint, that, developed, in, the, tradition, fills, most, of, the, vertical, format, picture, spaces, with, the, landscape, though, clouds, are, also, typically, shown, in, the, sky, shown, in, a, curling, convention, drawn, from, chinese, art, usually, everything, seen, is, fairly, close, to, the, viewer, and, there, are, few, distant, views, normally, all, landscape, images, show, narrative, scenes, with, figures, but, there, are, a, few, drawn, pure, landscape, scenes, in, albums, hindu, painting, had, long, set, scenes, amid, lush, vegetation, as, many, of, the, stories, depicted, demanded, mughal, painting, combined, this, and, the, persian, style, and, in, miniatures, of, royal, hunts, often, depicted, wide, landscapes, scenes, set, during, the, monsoon, rains, with, dark, clouds, and, flashes, of, lightning, are, popular, later, influence, from, european, prints, is, evident, most, early, landscapes, are, clearly, imaginary, although, from, very, early, on, townscape, views, are, clearly, intended, to, represent, actual, cities, with, varying, degrees, of, accuracy, various, techniques, were, used, to, simulate, the, randomness, of, natural, forms, in, invented, compositions, the, medieval, advice, of, cennino, cennini, to, copy, ragged, crags, from, small, rough, rocks, was, apparently, followed, by, both, poussin, and, thomas, gainsborough, while, degas, copied, cloud, forms, from, a, crumpled, handkerchief, held, up, against, the, light, the, system, of, alexander, cozens, used, random, ink, blots, to, give, the, basic, shape, of, an, invented, landscape, to, be, elaborated, by, the, artist, the, distinctive, background, view, across, lake, geneva, to, the, le, m, le, peak, in, the, miraculous, draught, of, fishes, by, konrad, witz, 1444, is, often, cited, as, the, first, western, rural, landscape, to, show, a, specific, scene, the, landscape, studies, by, d, rer, clearly, represent, actual, scenes, which, can, be, identified, in, many, cases, and, were, at, least, partly, made, on, the, spot, the, drawings, by, fra, bartolomeo, also, seem, clearly, sketched, from, nature, d, rer, s, finished, works, seem, generally, to, use, invented, landscapes, although, the, spectacular, bird, s, eye, view, in, his, engraving, nemesis, shows, an, actual, view, in, the, alps, with, additional, elements, several, landscapists, are, known, to, have, made, drawings, and, watercolour, sketches, from, nature, but, the, evidence, for, early, oil, painting, being, done, outside, is, limited, the, pre, raphaelite, brotherhood, made, special, efforts, in, this, direction, but, it, was, not, until, the, introduction, of, ready, mixed, oil, paints, in, tubes, in, the, 1870s, followed, by, the, portable, box, easel, that, painting, en, plein, air, became, widely, practiced, a, curtain, of, mountains, at, the, back, of, the, landscape, is, standard, in, wide, roman, views, and, even, more, so, in, chinese, landscapes, relatively, little, space, is, given, to, the, sky, in, early, works, in, either, tradition, the, chinese, often, used, mist, or, clouds, between, mountains, and, also, sometimes, show, clouds, in, the, sky, far, earlier, than, western, artists, who, initially, mainly, use, clouds, as, supports, or, covers, for, divine, figures, or, heaven, both, panel, paintings, and, miniatures, in, manuscripts, usually, had, a, patterned, or, gold, sky, or, background, above, the, horizon, until, about, 1400, but, frescos, by, giotto, and, other, italian, artists, had, long, shown, plain, blue, skies, the, single, surviving, altarpiece, from, melchior, broederlam, completed, for, champmol, in, 1399, has, a, gold, sky, populated, not, only, by, god, and, angels, but, also, a, flying, bird, a, coastal, scene, in, the, turin, milan, hours, has, a, sky, overcast, with, carefully, observed, clouds, in, woodcuts, a, large, blank, space, can, cause, the, paper, to, sag, during, printing, so, d, rer, and, other, artists, often, include, clouds, or, squiggles, representing, birds, to, avoid, this, the, monochrome, chinese, tradition, has, used, ink, on, silk, or, paper, since, its, inception, with, a, great, emphasis, on, the, individual, brushstroke, to, define, the, ts, un, or, wrinkles, in, mountain, sides, and, the, other, features, of, the, landscape, western, watercolour, is, a, more, tonal, medium, even,
