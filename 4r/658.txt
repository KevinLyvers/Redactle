their, registered, marks, in, 2019, the, companies, pursued, a, british, law, student, named, graham, jules, who, was, attempting, to, publish, a, self, help, book, titled, business, zero, to, superhero, currently, much, academic, debate, exists, about, whether, the, super, hero, mark, has, become, generic, and, whether, dc, and, marvel, have, created, a, duopoly, over, the, super, hero, mark, conversely, dc, and, marvel, hold, that, they, are, merely, exercising, their, right, and, duty, to, protect, their, registered, marks, currently, the, following, trademarks, are, registered, jointly, to, marvel, characters, inc, and, dc, comics, 73222079, super, heroes, for, publications, 72243225, super, hero, for, costumes, 77732560, super, heroes, for, production, and, distribution,

super, hero, related, marks, for, instance, dc, owns, legion, of, super, heroes, and, dc, super, hero, girls, and, marvel, owns, marvel, super, hero, island, and, marvel, super, hero, adventures, dc, and, marvel, have, garnered, a, reputation, for, zealously, protecting, their, super, hero, marks, as, noted, above, one, of, these, instances, included, a, man, by, the, name, of, graham, jules, who, sought, to, publish, a, book, entitled, business, zero, to, superhero, in, 2014, he, received, a, cease, and, desist, from, dc, and, marvel, who, claimed, that, his, use, of, the, term, superhero, would, cause, confusion, and, dilute, their, brands, he, was, offered, a, few, thousand, dollars, in, settlement, to, change, the, name, of, his, book, but, he, did, not, concede, a, few, days, prior, to, the, scheduled, hearing, at, the, intellectual, property, office, in, london, the, companies, backed, down, a, similar, scenario, occurred, when, comic, book, creator, ray, felix, attempted, to, register, his, comic, book, series, a, world, without, superheroes, with, the, uspto, felix, is, one, of, many, who, argue, that, the, term, super, hero, has, become, generic, see, discussion, below, felix, s, mark, is, currently, abandoned, but, he, has, stated, that, he, intends, to, fight, against, dc, and, marvel, for, use, of, the, term, there, is, an, ongoing, debate, among, legal, scholars, and, in, the, courts, about, whether, the, term, superhero, has, become, genericized, due, to, its, widespread, use, in, popular, culture, similar, to, terms, like, aspirin, or, escalator, which, lost, their, trademark, protection, and, became, generic, terms, for, their, respective, products, some, argue, the, term, super, hero, trademark, is, at, risk, of, becoming, generic, courts, have, noted, that, determining, whether, a, term, has, become, generic, is, a, highly, factual, inquiry, not, suitable, for, resolution, without, considering, evidence, like, dictionary, definitions, media, usage, and, consumer, surveys, trademark, owners, can, take, steps, to, prevent, genericide, such, as, using, the, trademark, with, the, generic, product, name, educating, the, public, and, policing, unauthorized, uses, however, misuse, by, the, public, alone, does, not, necessarily, cause, a, trademark, to, become, generic, if, the, primary, significance, of, the, term, is, still, to, indicate, a, particular, source, some, legal, experts, argue, that, like, the, once, trademarked, terms, aspirin, and, yo, yo, the, term, superhero, now, primarily, refers, to, a, general, type, of, character, with, extraordinary, abilities, rather, than, characters, originating, from, specific, publishers, however, dc, and, marvel, may, be, able, to, preserve, their, trademark, by, consistently, referring, to, dc, superheroes, and, marvel, superheroes, and, challenging, unauthorized, uses, ultimately, whether, superhero, has, become, or, will, become, generic, is, a, complex, issue, that, continues, to, be, debated, the, potential, impact, on, independent, creators, and, the, public, domain, is, also, implicated, if, superhero, is, deemed, generic, it, could, open, the, door, for, more, creators, to, use, the, term, to, describe, characters, without, fear, of, trademark, infringement, however, courts, may, still, find, particular, uses, of, even, generic, terms, to, be, confusing, or, misleading, depending, on, the, specific, context, in, keeping, with, their, origins, as, representing, the, archetypical, hero, stock, character, in, 1930s, american, comics, superheroes, are, predominantly, depicted, as, white, american, middle, or, upper, class, young, adult, males, and, females, who, are, typically, tall, athletic, educated, physically, attractive, and, in, perfect, health, beginning, in, the, 1960s, with, the, civil, rights, movement, in, the, united, states, and, increasingly, with, the, rising, concern, over, political, correctness, in, the, 1980s, superhero, fiction, centered, on, cultural, ethnic, national, racial, and, language, minority, groups, from, the, perspective, of, us, demographics, began, to, be, produced, this, began, with, depiction, of, black, superheroes, in, the, 1960s, followed, in, the, 1970s, with, a, number, of, other, ethnic, minority, superheroes, in, keeping, with, the, political, mood, of, the, time, cultural, diversity, and, inclusivism, would, be, an, important, part, of, superhero, groups, starting, from, the, 1980s, in, the, 1990s, this, was, further, augmented, by, the, first, depictions, of, superheroes, as, homosexual, in, 2017,

portrayed, as, wearing, a, suit, not, unlike, the, swimsuits, in, the, t, v, show, baywatch, the, sexualization, of, women, in, comic, books, can, be, explained, mainly, by, the, fact, that, the, majority, of, writers, are, male, not, only, are, the, writers, mostly, male, but, the, audience, is, mostly, male, as, well, therefore, writers, are, designing, characters, to, appeal, to, a, mostly,
