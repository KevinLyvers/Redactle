romantic, music, is, a, stylistic, movement, in, western, classical, music, associated, with, the, period, of, the, 19th, century, commonly, referred, to, as, the, romantic, era, or, romantic, period, it, is, closely, related, to, the, broader, concept, of, romanticism, the, intellectual, artistic, and, literary, movement, that, became, prominent, in, western, culture, from, about, 1798, until, 1837, romantic, composers, sought, to, create, music, that, was, individualistic, emotional, dramatic, and, often, programmatic, reflecting, broader, trends, within, the, movements, of, romantic, literature, poetry, art, and, philosophy, romantic, music, was, often, ostensibly, inspired, by, or, else, sought, to, evoke, non, musical, stimuli, such, as, nature, literature, poetry, super, natural, elements, or, the, fine, arts, it, included, features, such, as, increased, chromaticism, and, moved, away, from, traditional, forms, the, romantic, movement, was, an, artistic, literary, and, intellectual, movement, that, originated, in, the, second, half, of, the, 18th, century, in, europe, and, strengthened, in, reaction, to, the, industrial, revolution, in, part, it, was, a, revolt, against, social, and, political, norms, of, the, age, of, enlightenment, and, a, reaction, against, the, scientific, rationalization, of, nature, casey, 2008, it, was, embodied, most, strongly, in, the, visual, arts, music, literature, and, education, and, was, in, turn, influenced, by, developments, in, natural, history, one, of, the, first, significant, applications, of, the, term, to, music, was, in, 1789, in, the, m, moires, by, the, frenchman, andr, gr, try, but, it, was, e, t, a, hoffmann, who, established, the, principles, of, musical, romanticism, in, a, lengthy, review, of, ludwig, van, beethoven, s, fifth, symphony, published, in, 1810, and, an, 1813, article, on, beethoven, s, instrumental, music, in, the, first, of, these, essays, hoffmann, traced, the, beginnings, of, musical, romanticism, to, the, later, works, of, haydn, and, mozart, it, was, hoffmann, s, fusion, of, ideas, already, associated, with, the, term, romantic, used, in, opposition, to, the, restraint, and, formality, of, classical, models, that, elevated, music, and, especially, instrumental, music, to, a, position, of, pre, eminence, in, romanticism, as, the, art, most, suited, to, the, expression, of, emotions, it, was, also, through, the, writings, of, hoffmann, and, other, german, authors, that, german, music, was, brought, to, the, center, of, musical, romanticism, the, classical, period, often, used, short, even, fragmentary, thematic, material, while, the, romantic, period, tended, to, make, greater, use, of, longer, more, fully, defined, and, more, emotionally, evocative, themes, characteristics, often, attributed, to, romanticism, in, music, there, is, a, relatively, clear, dividing, line, in, musical, structure, and, form, following, the, death, of, beethoven, whether, one, counts, beethoven, as, a, romantic, composer, or, not, the, breadth, and, power, of, his, work, gave, rise, to, a, feeling, that, the, classical, sonata, form, and, indeed, the, structure, of, the, symphony, sonata, and, string, quartet, had, been, exhausted, events, and, changes, in, society, such, as, ideas, attitudes, discoveries, inventions, and, historical, events, often, affect, music, for, example, the, industrial, revolution, was, in, full, effect, by, the, late, 18th, century, and, early, 19th, century, this, event, profoundly, affected, music, there, were, major, improvements, in, the, mechanical, valves, and, keys, that, most, woodwinds, and, brass, instruments, depend, on, the, new, and, innovative, instruments, could, be, played, with, greater, ease, and, they, were, more, reliable, another, development, that, affected, music, was, the, rise, of, the, middle, class, composers, before, this, period, lived, under, the, patronage, of, the, aristocracy, many, times, their, audience, was, small, composed, mostly, of, the, upper, class, and, individuals, who, were, knowledgeable, about, music, the, romantic, composers, on, the, other, hand, often, wrote, for, public, concerts, and, festivals, with, large, audiences, of, paying, customers, who, had, not, necessarily, had, any, music, lessons, composers, of, the, romantic, era, like, elgar, showed, the, world, that, there, should, be, no, segregation, of, musical, tastes, and, that, the, purpose, was, to, write, music, that, was, to, be, heard, the, music, composed, by, romantic, reflected, the, importance, of, the, individual, by, being, composed, in, ways, that, were, often, less, restrictive, and, more, often, focused, on, the, composer, s, skills, as, a, person, than, prior, means, of, writing, music, during, the, romantic, period, music, often, took, on, a, much, more, nationalistic, purpose, composers, composed, with, a, distinct, sound, that, represented, their, home, country, and, traditions, for, example, jean, sibelius, finlandia, has, been, interpreted, to, represent, the, rising, nation, of, finland, which, would, someday, gain, independence, from, russian, control, fr, d, ric, chopin, was, one, of, the, first, composers, to, incorporate, nationalistic, elements, into, his, compositions, joseph, machlis, states, poland, s, struggle, for, freedom, from, tsarist, rule, aroused, the, national, poet, in, poland, examples, of, musical, nationalism, abound, in, the, output, of, the, romantic, era, the, folk, idiom, is, prominent, in, the, mazurkas, of, chopin, his, mazurkas, and, polonaises, are, particularly, notable, for, their, use, of, nationalistic, rhythms, moreover, during, world, war, ii, the, nazis, forbade, the, playing, of, chopin, s, polonaises, in, warsaw, because, of, the, powerful, symbolism, residing, in, these, works, other, composers, such, as, bed, ich, smetana, wrote, pieces, that, musically, described, their, homelands, in, particular, smetana, s, vltava, is, a, symphonic, poem, about, the, moldau, river, in, the, modern, day, czech, republic, the, second, in, a, cycle, of, six, nationalistic, symphonic, poems, collectively, titled, m, vlast, my, homeland, smetana, also, composed, eight, nationalist, operas, all, of, which, remain, in, the, repertory, they, established, him, as, the, first, czech, nationalist, composer, as, well, as, the, most, important, czech, opera, composer, of, the, generation, who, came, to, prominence, in, the, 1860s, the, transition, of, viennese, classicism, to, romanticism, can, be, found, in, the, work, of, ludwig, van, beethoven, many, typically, romantic, elements, are, encountered, for, the, first, time, in, his, works, these, works, stand, here, in, contrast, to, vocal, music, and, are, prete, instrumental, music, according, to, hoffmann, the, pure, instrumental, music, of, viennese, classical, music, especially, that, of, beethoven, since, it, is, free, of, material, or, program, is, the, embodiment, of, the, romantic, art, idea, another, one, of, the, most, important, representatives, of, late, classicism, and, early, romanticism, is, franz, schubert, because, only, with, him, did, romantic, features, come, into, the, german, language, opera, with, his, chamber, music, works, and, later, also, symphonies, in, this, field, his, work, is, supplemented, by, the, ballads, of, carl, loewe, carl, maria, von, weber, is, important, for, the, development, of, the, german, opera, especially, with, his, popular, freisch, tz, in, addition, there, are, fantastic, horrious, materials, by, heinrich, marschner, and, finally, the, cheerful, opera, by, albert, lortzing, while, louis, spohr, became, known, mainly, for, his, instrumental, music, still, largely, attached, to, classical, music, is, the, work, of, johann, nepomuk, hummel, ferdinand, ries, and, the, frenchman, george, onslow, italy, experienced, the, heyday, of, the, belcanto, opera, in, early, romanticism, associated, with, the, names, of, gioachino, rossini, gaetano, donizetti, and, vincenzo, bellini, while, rossini, s, comic, operas, are, primarily, known, today, often, only, through, their, rousing, overtures, donizetti, and, bellini, predominate, tragic, content, the, most, important, italian, instrumental, composer, of, this, time, was, the, legendary, devil, s, violinist, niccol, paganini, in, france, on, the, one, hand, the, light, op, ra, comique, developed, its, representatives, are, fran, ois, adrien, boieldieu, daniel, fran, ois, esprit, auber, and, adolphe, adam, the, latter, also, known, for, his, ballets, one, can, also, quote, the, famous, eccentric, composer, and, harpist, robert, nicolas, charles, bochsa, seven, operas, in, addition, the, grand, op, ra, came, up, with, pompous, stage, sets, ballets, and, large, choirs, her, first, representative, was, gaspare, spontini, her, most, important, giacomo, meyerbeer, music, development, has, now, also, taken, an, upswing, in, other, european, countries, the, irishman, john, field, composed, the, first, nocturnes, for, piano, friedrich, kuhlau, worked, in, denmark, and, the, swede, franz, berwald, wrote, four, very, idiosyncratic, symphonies, the, high, romanticism, can, be, divided, into, two, phases, in, the, first, phase, the, actual, romantic, music, reaches, its, peak, the, polish, composer, fr, d, ric, chopin, explored, previously, unknown, depths, of, emotion, in, his, character, pieces, and, dances, for, piano, robert, schumann, mentally, immersed, at, the, end, of, his, life, represents, in, person, as, well, as, in, music, almost, the, prototype, of, the, passionate, romantic, artist, shadowed, by, tragedy, his, idiosyncratic, piano, pieces, chamber, music, works, and, symphonies, should, have, a, lasting, influence, on, the, following, generation, of, musicians, franz, liszt, who, came, from, the, german, minority, in, hungary, was, on, the, one, hand, a, swarmed, piano, virtuoso, but, on, the, other, hand, also, laid, the, foundation, for, the, progressive, new, german, school, with, his, harmoniously, bold, symphonic, poems, also, committed, to, program, music, was, the, technique, of, the, id, e, fixe, leitmotif, of, the, frenchman, hector, berlioz, who, also, significantly, expanded, the, orchestra, felix, mendelssohn, was, again, more, oriented, towards, the, classicist, formal, language, and, became, a, role, model, especially, for, scandinavian, composers, such, as, the, dane, niels, wilhelm, gade, in, opera, the, operas, of, otto, nicolai, and, friedrich, von, flotow, still, dominated, in, germany, when, richard, wagner, wrote, his, first, romantic, operas, the, early, works, of, giuseppe, verdi, were, also, still, based, on, the, belcanto, ideal, of, the, older, generation, in, france, the, op, ra, lyrique, was, developed, by, ambroise, thomas, and, charles, gounod, russian, music, found, its, own, language, in, the, operas, of, mikhail, glinka, and, alexander, dargomyschski, the, second, phase, of, high, romanticism, runs, in, parallel, with, the, style, of, realism, in, literature, and, the, visual, arts, in, the, second, half, of, his, creation, wagner, now, developed, his, leitmotif, technique, with, which, he, holds, together, the, four, part, ring, of, the, nibelungen, composed, without, arias, the, orchestra, is, treated, symphonically, the, chromaticism, reaches, its, extreme, in, tristan, and, isolde, a, whole, crowd, of, disciples, is, under, the, influence, of, wagner, s, progressive, ideas, among, them, for, example, peter, cornelius, on, the, other, hand, an, opposition, arose, from, numerous, more, conservative, composers, to, whom, johannes, brahms, who, sought, a, logical, continuation, of, classical, music, in, symphony, chamber, music, and, song, became, a, model, of, scale, due, to, the, depth, of, the, sensation, and, a, masterful, composition, technique, among, others, robert, volkmann, friedrich, kiel, carl, reinecke, max, bruch, josef, gabriel, rheinberger, and, hermann, goetz, are, included, in, this, party, in, addition, some, important, loners, came, on, the, scene, among, whom, anton, bruckner, particularly, stands, out, although, a, wagner, supporter, his, clear, form, style, differs, significantly, from, that, of, that, composer, for, example, the, block, based, instrumentation, of, bruckner, s, symphonies, is, derived, from, the, registers, of, the, organ, in, the, ideological, struggle, against, wagner, s, adversaries, he, was, portrayed, by, his, followers, as, a, counterpart, of, brahms, felix, draeseke, who, originally, wrote, future, music, in, classical, form, starting, from, liszt, also, stands, between, the, parties, in, composition, verdi, also, reached, the, way, to, a, well, composed, musical, drama, albeit, in, a, different, way, than, wagner, his, immense, charisma, made, all, other, composers, fade, in, italy, including, amilcare, ponchielli, and, arrigo, boito, who, was, also, the, librettist, of, his, late, operas, otello, and, falstaff, in, france, on, the, other, hand, the, light, muse, triumphed, first, in, the, form, of, the, socio, critical, operettas, of, jacques, offenbach, lyrical, opera, found, its, climax, in, the, works, of, jules, massenet, while, in, the, carmen, by, georges, bizet, realism, came, for, the, first, time, louis, th, odore, gouvy, built, a, stylistic, bridge, to, german, music, the, operas, symphonies, and, chamber, music, works, of, the, extremely, versatile, camille, saint, sa, ns, were, as, were, the, ballets, of, l, o, delibes, more, tradition, oriented, new, orchestra, colors, were, found, in, the, compositions, of, douard, lalo, and, emmanuel, chabrier, the, belgian, born, c, sar, franck, was, accompanied, by, a, revival, of, organ, music, which, was, continued, by, charles, marie, widor, later, louis, vierne, and, charles, tournemire, a, specific, national, romanticism, had, by, now, emerged, in, almost, all, european, countries, the, national, russian, current, started, by, glinka, was, continued, in, russia, by, the, group, of, five, mily, balakirev, alexander, borodin, modest, mussorgsky, nikolai, rimsky, korsakov, and, c, sar, cui, more, western, oriented, were, anton, rubinstein, and, pyotr, tchaikovsky, whose, ballets, and, symphonies, gained, great, popularity, bed, ich, smetana, founded, czech, national, music, with, his, operas, and, the, symphony, poems, oriented, towards, liszt, the, symphonies, concerts, and, chamber, music, works, of, anton, n, dvo, k, on, the, other, hand, have, brahms, as, a, model, in, poland, stanis, aw, moniuszko, was, the, leading, opera, composer, in, hungary, ferenc, erkel, norway, produced, its, best, known, composers, with, edvard, grieg, creator, of, lyrical, piano, works, songs, and, orchestral, works, such, as, the, peer, gynt, suite, england, s, voice, resonated, with, the, brahms, oriented, hubert, parry, and, symphonist, as, well, as, the, bizarre, operettas, of, arthur, sullivan, in, late, romanticism, also, called, post, romanticism, the, traditional, forms, and, elements, of, music, are, further, dissolved, an, increasingly, colorful, orchestral, palette, an, ever, increasing, range, of, musical, means, the, spread, of, tonality, to, its, limits, exaggerated, emotions, and, an, increasingly, individual, tonal, language, of, the, individual, composer, are, typical, features, the, music, is, led, to, the, threshold, of, modernity, thus, the, symphonies, of, gustav, mahler, reached, previously, unknown, dimensions, partly, give, up, the, traditional, four, sentence, and, often, contain, vocal, proportions, but, behind, the, monumental, facade, is, the, modern, expressiveness, of, the, fin, de, si, cle, this, psychological, expressiveness, is, also, contained, in, the, songs, of, hugo, wolf, miniature, dramas, for, voice, and, piano, more, committed, to, tradition, particularly, oriented, towards, bruckner, are, the, symphonies, of, franz, schmidt, and, richard, wetz, while, max, reger, resorted, to, bach, s, polyphony, in, his, numerous, instrumental, works, but, developed, it, harmoniously, extremely, boldly, among, the, numerous, composers, of, the, reger, successor, julius, weismann, and, joseph, haas, stand, out, among, the, outstanding, late, romantic, sound, creators, is, also, the, idiosyncratic, hans, pfitzner, although, a, traditionalist, and, decisive, opponent, of, modern, currents, quite, a, few, of, his, works, are, quite, close, to, the, musical, progress, of, the, time, his, successor, include, walter, braunfels, who, mainly, emerged, as, an, opera, composer, and, the, symphonist, wilhelm, furtw, ngler, the, opera, stage, was, particularly, suitable, for, increased, emotions, the, folk, and, fairy, tale, operas, of, engelbert, humperdinck, wilhelm, kienzl, and, siegfried, wagner, the, son, of, richard, wagner, were, still, quite, good, but, even, eugen, d, albert, and, max, von, schillings, irritated, the, nerves, with, a, german, variant, of, verism, erotic, symbolism, can, be, found, in, the, stage, works, of, alexander, von, zemlinsky, and, franz, schreker, richard, strauss, went, even, further, to, the, limits, of, tonality, with, salome, and, elektra, before, he, took, more, traditional, paths, with, the, rosenkavalier, in, the, style, related, to, the, works, of, strauss, the, compositions, emil, nikolaus, von, rezniceks, and, paul, graeners, are, shown, in, italy, opera, still, dominated, during, this, time, this, is, where, verism, developed, an, exaggerated, realism, that, could, easily, turn, into, the, striking, and, melodramatic, on, the, opera, stage, despite, their, extensive, work, ruggero, leoncavallo, pietro, mascagni, francesco, cilea, and, umberto, giordano, have, only, become, known, through, one, opera, at, a, time, only, giacomo, puccini, s, work, has, been, completely, preserved, in, the, repertoire, of, the, opera, houses, although, he, was, also, often, accused, of, sentimentality, despite, some, veristic, works, ermanno, wolf, ferrari, was, mainly, considered, a, revival, of, the, opera, buffa, ferruccio, busoni, a, temporarily, defender, of, modern, classicity, living, in, germany, left, behind, a, rather, conventional, little, played, work, thus, instrumental, music, actually, only, found, its, place, in, italian, music, again, with, ottorino, respighi, who, was, influenced, by, impressionism, the, term, impressionism, comes, from, painting, and, like, there, it, also, developed, in, music, in, france, in, the, works, of, claude, debussy, the, structures, dissolved, into, the, finest, nuances, of, rhythm, dynamics, and, timbre, this, development, was, prepared, in, the, work, of, vincent, d, indy, ernest, chausson, and, above, all, in, the, songs, and, chamber, music, of, gabriel, faur, all, subsequent, french, composers, were, more, or, less, influenced, by, impressionism, the, most, important, among, them, was, maurice, ravel, a, brilliant, orchestral, virtuoso, albert, roussel, first, processed, exotic, topics, before, he, anticipated, neoclassical, tendencies, like, ravel, gabriel, piern, paul, dukas, charles, koechlin, and, florent, schmitt, also, dealt, with, symbolic, and, exotic, oriental, substances, the, loner, erik, satie, was, the, creator, of, spun, piano, pieces, and, idol, of, the, next, generation, nevertheless, impressionism, is, often, attributed, to, the, epoch, of, modernity, if, not, seen, as, its, own, epoch, hubert, parry, and, the, irishman, charles, villiers, stanford, initiated, late, romanticism, in, england, which, had, its, first, important, representative, in, edward, elgar, while, he, revived, the, oratorio, and, wrote, symphonies, and, concerts, frederick, delius, devoted, himself, to, particularly, small, orchestral, images, with, his, own, variant, of, impressionism, ethel, smyth, wrote, mainly, operas, and, chamber, music, in, a, style, that, reminded, brahms, ralph, vaughan, williams, whose, works, were, inspired, by, english, folk, songs, and, renaissance, music, became, the, most, important, symphonist, of, his, country, gustav, holst, incorporated, greek, mythology, and, indian, philosophy, into, his, work, very, idiosyncratic, composer, personalities, in, the, transition, to, modernity, were, also, havergal, brian, and, frank, bridge, in, russia, alexander, glazunov, decorated, his, traditional, composition, technique, with, a, colorful, orchestral, palette, the, mystic, alexander, scriabin, dreamed, of, a, synthesis, of, colors, sound, and, scents, sergei, rachmaninov, wrote, melancholic, pathetic, piano, pieces, and, concertos, full, of, intoxicating, virtuosity, while, the, piano, works, of, nikolai, medtner, are, more, lyrical, in, the, czech, republic, leo, jan, ek, deeply, rooted, in, the, music, of, his, moravian, homeland, found, new, areas, of, expression, with, the, development, of, the, language, melody, in, his, operas, the, local, sounds, are, also, unmistakable, in, the, music, of, zden, k, fibich, josef, bohuslav, foerster, v, t, zslav, nov, k, and, josef, suk, on, the, other, hand, there, is, a, slightly, morbid, exoticism, and, later, classicist, measure, in, the, work, of, the, polish, karol, szymanowski, the, most, important, danish, composer, is, carl, nielsen, known, for, symphonies, and, concerts, even, more, dominant, in, his, country, is, the, position, of, the, finn, jean, sibelius, also, a, symphonist, of, melancholy, expressiveness, and, clear, line, design, in, sweden, the, works, of, wilhelm, peterson, berger, wilhelm, stenhammar, and, hugo, alfv, n, show, a, typical, nordic, conservatism, and, the, norwegian, christian, sinding, also, composed, traditionally, the, music, of, spain, also, increased, in, popularity, again, after, a, long, time, first, in, the, piano, works, of, isaac, alb, niz, and, enrique, granados, then, in, the, operas, ballets, and, orchestral, works, of, manuel, de, falla, influenced, by, impressionism, finally, the, first, important, representatives, of, the, united, states, also, appeared, with, edward, macdowell, and, amy, beach, but, even, the, work, of, charles, ives, belonged, only, partly, to, late, romanticism, much, of, it, was, already, radically, modern, and, pointed, far, into, the, 20th, century, the, new, german, school, was, a, loose, collection, of, composers, and, critics, informally, led, by, franz, liszt, and, richard, wagner, who, strove, for, pushing, the, limits, of, chromatic, harmony, and, program, music, as, opposed, to, absolute, music, which, they, believed, had, reached, its, limit, under, ludwig, van, beethoven, this, group, also, pushed, for, the, development, and, innovation, of, the, symphonic, poem, thematic, transformation, in, musical, form, and, radical, changes, in, tonality, and, harmony, other, important, members, of, this, movement, includes, the, critic, richard, pohl, and, composers, felix, draeseke, julius, reubke, karl, klindworth, william, mason, and, peter, cornelius, the, conservatives, were, a, broad, group, of, musicians, and, critics, who, maintained, the, artistic, legacy, of, robert, schumann, who, adhered, to, composing, and, promoting, absolute, music, they, believed, in, continuing, along, the, footsteps, of, ludwig, van, beethoven, of, composing, the, symphony, genre, in, the, classical, mold, though, they, would, implement, their, own, musical, language, the, most, prominent, members, of, this, circle, were, johannes, brahms, joseph, joachim, clara, schumann, and, the, leipzig, conservatoire, which, had, been, founded, by, felix, mendelssohn, the, mighty, five, were, a, group, of, russian, composers, centered, in, saint, petersburg, who, collaborated, with, each, other, from, 1856, to, 1870, to, create, a, distinctly, russian, national, style, of, classical, music, they, were, often, at, odds, with, pyotr, ilyich, tchaikovsky, who, favored, a, more, western, approach, to, classical, composition, led, by, mily, balakirev, the, group, s, main, members, also, consisted, of, c, sar, cui, modest, mussorgsky, nikolai, rimsky, korsakov, and, alexander, borodin, the, belyayev, circle, was, a, society, of, russian, musicians, who, met, in, saint, petersburg, from, 1885, and, 1908, who, sought, to, continue, the, development, of, the, national, russian, style, of, classical, music, following, in, the, footsteps, of, the, mighty, five, although, they, were, far, more, tolerant, of, the, western, compositional, style, of, tchaikovsky, this, group, was, founded, by, russian, music, publisher, philanthropist, mitrofan, belyayev, the, two, most, important, composers, of, this, group, were, nikolai, rimsky, korsakov, and, alexander, glazunov, members, also, included, vladimir, stasov, anatoly, lyadov, alexander, ossovsky, witold, maliszewski, nikolai, tcherepnin, nikolay, sokolov, and, alexander, winkler, during, the, later, half, of, the, 19th, century, some, prominent, composers, began, exploring, the, limits, of, the, traditional, tonal, system, important, examples, include, tristan, und, isolde, by, richard, wagner, and, bagatelle, sans, tonalit, by, franz, liszt, this, limit, was, finally, reached, during, the, late, romantic, period, where, progressive, tonality, is, demonstrated, in, the, works, of, composers, such, as, gustav, mahler, with, these, developments, romanticism, finally, began, to, break, apart, into, several, new, parallel, movements, forming, in, response, bringing, way, to, modernism, some, notable, movements, to, form, in, response, to, romanticism, s, collapse, include, expressionism, with, arnold, schoenberg, and, the, second, viennese, school, being, its, main, promoters, and, primitivism, with, igor, stravinsky, being, its, most, influential, composer, carried, to, the, highest, degree, by, ludwig, van, beethoven, the, symphony, becomes, the, most, prestigious, form, to,
