non, fiction, or, nonfiction, is, any, document, or, media, content, that, attempts, in, good, faith, to, convey, information, only, about, the, real, world, rather, than, being, grounded, in, imagination, non, fiction, typically, aims, to, present, topics, objectively, based, on, historical, scientific, and, empirical, information, however, some, non, fiction, ranges, into, more, subjective, territory, including, sincerely, held, opinions, on, real, world, topics, often, referring, specifically, to, prose, writing, non, fiction, is, one, of, the, two, fundamental, approaches, to, story, and, storytelling, in, contrast, to, narrative, fiction, which, is, largely, populated, by, imaginary, characters, and, events, non, fiction, writers, can, show, the, reasons, and, consequences, of, events, they, can, compare, contrast, classify, categorise, and, summarise, information, put, the, facts, in, a, logical, or, chronological, order, infer, and, reach, conclusions, about, facts, etc, they, can, use, graphic, structural, and, printed, appearance, features, such, as, pictures, graphs, or, charts, diagrams, flowcharts, summaries, glossaries, sidebars, timelines, table, of, contents, headings, subheadings, bolded, or, italicised, words, footnotes, maps, indices, labels, captions, etc, to, help, readers, find, information, while, specific, claims, in, a, non, fiction, work, may, prove, inaccurate, the, sincere, author, aims, to, be, truthful, at, the, time, of, composition, a, non, fiction, account, is, an, exercise, in, accurately, representing, a, topic, and, remains, distinct, from, any, implied, endorsement, the, numerous, narrative, techniques, used, within, fiction, are, generally, thought, inappropriate, for, use, in, non, fiction, they, are, still, present, particularly, in, older, works, but, are, often, muted, so, as, not, to, overshadow, the, information, within, the, work, simplicity, clarity, and, directness, are, some, of, the, most, important, considerations, when, producing, non, fiction, audience, is, important, in, any, artistic, or, descriptive, endeavour, but, it, is, perhaps, most, important, in, non, fiction, in, fiction, the, writer, believes, that, readers, will, make, an, effort, to, follow, and, interpret, an, indirectly, or, abstractly, presented, progression, of, theme, whereas, the, production, of, non, fiction, has, more, to, do, with, the, direct, provision, of, information, understanding, of, the, potential, readers, use, for, the, work, and, their, existing, knowledge, of, a, subject, are, both, fundamental, for, effective, non, fiction, despite, the, claim, to, truth, of, non, fiction, it, is, often, necessary, to, persuade, the, reader, to, agree, with, the, ideas, and, so, a, balanced, coherent, and, informed, argument, is, vital, however, the, boundaries, between, fiction, and, non, fiction, are, continually, blurred, and, argued, upon, especially, in, the, field, of, biography, as, virginia, woolf, said, if, we, think, of, truth, as, something, of, granite, like, solidity, and, of, personality, as, something, of, rainbow, like, intangibility, and, reflect, that, the, aim, of, biography, is, to, weld, these, two, into, one, seamless, whole, we, shall, admit, that, the, problem, is, a, stiff, one, and, that, we, need, not, wonder, if, biographers, for, the, most, part, failed, to, solve, it, including, information, that, the, author, knows, to, be, untrue, within, such, works, is, usually, regarded, as, dishonest, still, certain, kinds, of, written, works, can, legitimately, be, either, fiction, or, non, fiction, such, as, journals, of, self, expression, letters, magazine, articles, and, other, expressions, of, imagination, though, they, are, mostly, either, one, or, the, other, a, blend, of, both, is, also, possible, some, fiction, may, include, non, fictional, elements, semi, fiction, is, fiction, implementing, a, great, deal, of, non, fiction, such, as, a, fictional, description, based, on, a, true, story, some, non, fiction, may, include, elements, of, unverified, supposition, deduction, or, imagination, for, the, purpose, of, smoothing, out, a, narrative, but, the, inclusion, of, open, falsehoods, would, discredit, it, as, a, work, of, non, fiction, the, publishing, and, bookselling, businesses, sometimes, use, the, phrase, literary, non, fiction, to, distinguish, works, with, a, more, literary, or, intellectual, bent, as, opposed, to, the, bulk, of, non, fiction, subjects, based, on, the, author, s, intention, or, the, purpose, of, the, content, the, main, genres, of, non, fiction, are, instructional, explanatory, discussion, based, report, based, non, chronological, opinion, based, persuasive, and, relating, chronological, recounting, non, fiction, non, fictional, works, of, these, different, genres, can, be, created, with, the, help, of, a, range, of, structures, or, formats, such, as, and, so, on, common, literary, examples, of, non, fiction, include, expository, argumentative, functional, and, opinion, pieces, essays, on, art, or, literature, biographies, memoirs, journalism, and, historical, scientific, technical, or, economic, writings, including, electronic, ones
