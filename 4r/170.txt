it, is, credited, as, helping, end, an, era, of, didacticism, in, children, s, literature, inaugurating, an, era, in, which, writing, for, children, aimed, to, delight, or, entertain, the, tale, plays, with, logic, giving, the, story, lasting, popularity, with, adults, as, well, as, with, children, the, titular, character, alice, shares, her, name, with, alice, liddell, a, girl, carroll, knew, scholars, disagree, about, the, extent, to, which, the, character, was, based, upon, her, the, book, has, never, been, out, of, print, and, has, been, translated, into, 174, languages, its,

1871, entitled, through, the, looking, glass, and, a, shortened, version, for, young, children, the, nursery, alice, in, 1890, alice, s, adventures, in, wonderland, was, conceived, on, 4, july, 1862, when, lewis, carroll, and, reverend, robinson, duckworth, rowed, up, the, river, isis, with, the, three, young, daughters, of, carroll, s, friend, henry, liddell, lorina, charlotte, aged, 13, prima, in, the, book, s, prefatory, verse, alice, pleasance, aged, 10, secunda, in, the, verse, and, edith, mary, aged, 8, tertia, in, the, verse, the, journey, began, at, folly, bridge, oxford, and, ended, 5, miles, 8, km, upstream, at, godstow, oxfordshire, during, the, trip, carroll, told, the, girls, a, story, that, he, described, in, his, diary, as, alice, s, adventures, under, ground, which, his, journal, says, he, undertook, to, write, out, for, alice, alice, liddell, recalled, that, she, asked, carroll, to, write, it, down, unlike, other, stories, he, had, told, her, this, one, she, wanted, to, preserve, she, finally, received, the, manuscript, more, than, two, years, later, 4, july, was, known, as, the, golden, afternoon, prefaced, in, the, novel, as, a, poem, in, fact, the, weather, around, oxford, on, 4, july, was, cool, and, rather, wet, although, at, least, one, scholar, has, disputed, this, claim, scholars, debate, whether, carroll, in, fact, came, up, with, alice, during, the, golden, afternoon, or, whether, the, story, was, developed, over, a, longer, period, carroll, had, known, the, liddell, children, since, around, march, 1856, when, he, befriended, harry, liddell, he, had, met, lorina, by, early, march, as, well, in, june, 1856, he, took, the, children, out, on, the, river, robert, douglas, fairhurst, who, wrote, a, literary, biography, of, carroll, suggests, that, carroll, favoured, alice, pleasance, liddell, in, particular, because, her, name, was, ripe, for, allusion, pleasance, means, pleasure, and, the, name, alice, appeared, in, contemporary, works, including, the, poem, alice, gray, by, william, mee, of, which, carroll, wrote, a, parody, alice, is, a, character, in, dream, children, a, reverie, a, prose, piece, by, charles, lamb, carroll, an, amateur, photographer, by, the, late, 1850s, produced, many, photographic, portraits, of, the, liddell, children, but, none, more, than, alice, of, whom, 20, survive, carroll, began, writing, the, manuscript, of, the, story, the, next, day, although, that, earliest, version, is, lost, the, girls, and, carroll, took, another, boat, trip, a, month, later, when, he, elaborated, the, plot, of, the, story, to, alice, and, in, november, he, began, working, on, the, manuscript, in, earnest, to, add, the, finishing, touches, he, researched, natural, history, in, connection, with, the, animals, presented, in, the, book, and, then, had, the, book, examined, by, other, children, particularly, those, of, george, macdonald, though, carroll, did, add, his, own, illustrations, to, the, original, copy, on, publication, he, was, advised, to, find, a, professional, illustrator, so, that, the, pictures, were, more, appealing, to, its, audience, he, subsequently, approached, john, tenniel, to, reinterpret, carroll, s, visions, through, his, own, artistic, eye, telling, him, that, the, story, had, been, well, liked, by, the, children, carroll, began, planning, a, print, edition, of, the, alice, story, in, 1863, he, wrote, on, 9, may, 1863, that, macdonald, s, family, had, suggested, he, publish, alice, a, diary, entry, for, 2, july, says, that, he, received, a, specimen, page, of, the, print, edition, around, that, date, on, 26, november, 1864, carroll, gave, alice, the, manuscript, of, alice, s, adventures, under, ground, with, illustrations, by, carroll, dedicating, it, as, a, christmas, gift, to, a, dear, child, in, memory, of, a, summer, s, day, the, published, version, of, alice, s, adventures, in, wonderland, is, about, twice, the, length, of, alice, s, adventures, under, ground, and, includes, episodes, such, as, the, mad, hatter, s, tea, party, or, mad, tea, party, that, did, not, appear, in, the, manuscript, the, only, known, manuscript, copy, of, under, ground, is, held, in, the, british, library, macmillan, published, a, facsimile, of, the, manuscript, in, 1886, alice, a, young, girl, sits, bored, by, a, riverbank, and, spots, a, white, rabbit, with, a, pocket, watch, and, waistcoat, lamenting, that, he, is, late, surprised, alice, follows, him, down, a, rabbit, hole, which, sends, her, into, a, lengthy, plummet, but, to, a, safe, landing, inside, a, room, with, a, table, she, finds, a, key, to, a, tiny, door, beyond, which, is, a, garden, while, pondering, how, to, fit, through, the, door, she, discovers, a, bottle, labelled, drink, me, alice, drinks, some, of, the, bottle, s, contents, and, to, her, astonishment, she, shrinks, small, enough, to, enter, the, door, however, she, had, left, the, key, upon, the, table, and, cannot, reach, it, alice, then, discovers, and, eats, a, cake, labelled, eat, me, which, causes, her, to, grow, to, a, tremendous, size, unhappy, alice, bursts, into, tears, and, the, passing, white, rabbit, flees, in, a, panic, dropping, a, fan, and, two, gloves, alice, uses, the, fan, for, herself, which, causes, her, to, shrink, once, more, and, leaves, her, swimming, in, a, pool, of, her, own, tears, within, the, pool, alice, meets, various, animals, and, birds, who, convene, on, a, bank, and, engage, in, a, caucus, race, to, dry, themselves, following, the, end, of, the, race, alice, inadvertently, frightens, the, animals, away, by, discussing, her, cat, the, white, rabbit, appears, looking, for, the, gloves, and, fan, mistaking, alice, for, his, maidservant, he, orders, her, to, go, into, his, house, and, retrieve, them, alice, finds, another, bottle, and, drinks, from, it, which, causes, her, to, grow, to, such, an, extent, that, she, gets, stuck, in, the, house, attempting, to, extract, her, the, white, rabbit, and, his, neighbours, eventually, take, to, hurling, pebbles, that, turn, into, small, cakes, alice, eats, one, and, shrinks, herself, allowing, her, to, flee, into, the, forest, she, meets, a, caterpillar, seated, on, a, mushroom, and, smoking, a, hookah, during, the, caterpillar, s, questioning, alice, begins, to, admit, to, her, current, identity, crisis, compounded, by, her, inability, to, remember, a, poem, before, crawling, away, the, caterpillar, says, that, a, bite, of, one, side, of, the, mushroom, will, make, her, larger, while, a, bite, from, the, other, side, will, make, her, smaller, during, a, period, of, trial, and, error, alice, s, neck, extends, between, the, treetops, frightening, a, pigeon, who, mistakes, her, for, a, serpent, after, shrinking, to, an, appropriate, height, alice, arrives, at, the, home, of, a, duchess, who, owns, a, perpetually, grinning, cheshire, cat, the, duchess, s, baby, whom, she, hands, to, alice, transforms, into, a, piglet, which, alice, releases, into, the, woods, the, cheshire, cat, appears, to, alice, and, directs, her, toward, the, hatter, and, march, hare, before, disappearing, leaving, his, grin, behind, alice, finds, the, hatter, march, hare, and, a, sleepy, dormouse, in, the, midst, of, a, tea, party, the, hatter, explains, that, it, is, always, 6, pm, tea, time, claiming, that, time, is, standing, still, as, punishment, for, the, hatter, trying, to, kill, it, a, conversation, ensues, around, the, table, and, the, riddle, why, is, a, raven, like, a, writing, desk, is, brought, up, alice, impatiently, decides, to, leave, calling, the, party, stupid, noticing, a, door, on, a, tree, alice, passes, through, and, finds, herself, back, in, the, room, from, the, beginning, of, her, journey, she, takes, the, key, and, uses, it, to, open, the, door, to, the, garden, which, turns, out, to, be, the, croquet, court, of, the, queen, of, hearts, whose, guard, consists, of, living, playing, cards, alice, participates, in, a, croquet, game, in, which, hedgehogs, are, used, as, balls, flamingos, are, used, as, mallets, and, soldiers, act, as, hoops, the, queen, is, short, tempered, and, constantly, orders, beheadings, when, the, cheshire, cat, appears, as, only, a, head, the, queen, orders, his, beheading, only, to, be, told, that, such, an, act, is, impossible, because, the, cat, belongs, to, the, duchess, alice, prompts, the, queen, to, release, the, duchess, from, prison, to, resolve, the, matter, when, the, duchess, ruminates, on, finding, morals, in, everything, around, her, the, queen, dismisses, her, on, the, threat, of, execution, alice, then, meets, a, gryphon, and, a, mock, turtle, who, dance, to, the, lobster, quadrille, while, alice, recites, rather, incorrectly, a, poem, the, mock, turtle, sings, them, beautiful, soup, during, which, the, gryphon, drags, alice, away, for, a, trial, in, which, the, knave, of, hearts, stands, accused, of, stealing, the, queen, s, tarts, the, trial, is, conducted, by, the, king, of, hearts, and, the, jury, is, composed, of, animals, that, alice, previously, met, alice, gradually, grows, in, size, and, confidence, allowing, herself, increasingly, frequent, remarks, on, the, irrationality, of, the, proceedings, the, queen, eventually, commands, alice, s, beheading, but, alice, scoffs, that, the, queen, s, guard, is, only, a, pack, of, cards, although, alice, holds, her, own, for, a, time, the, guards, soon, gang, up, and, start, to, swarm, all, over, her, alice, s, sister, wakes, her, up, from, a, dream, brushing, what, turns, out, to, be, leaves, from, alice, s, face, alice, leaves, her, sister, on, the, bank, to, imagine, all, the, curious, happenings, for, herself, the, main, characters, in, alice, s, adventures, in, wonderland, are, the, following, in, the, annotated, alice, martin, gardner, provides, background, information, for, the, characters, the, members, of, the, boating, party, that, first, heard, carroll, s, tale, show, up, in, chapter, 3, a, caucus, race, and, a, long, tale, alice, liddell, is, there, while, carroll, is, caricatured, as, the, dodo, lewis, carroll, was, a, pen, name, for, charles, lutwidge, dodgson, because, he, stuttered, when, he, spoke, he, sometimes, pronounced, his, last, name, as, dodo, dodgson, the, duck, refers, to, robinson, duckworth, and, the, lory, and, eaglet, to, alice, liddell, s, sisters, lorina, and, edith, bill, the, lizard, may, be, a, play, on, the, name, of, british, prime, minister, benjamin, disraeli, one, of, tenniel, s, illustrations, in, through, the, looking, glass, the, 1871, sequel, to, alice, depicts, the, character, referred, to, as, the, man, in, white, paper, whom, alice, meets, on, a, train, as, a, caricature, of, disraeli, wearing, a, paper, hat, the, illustrations, of, the, lion, and, the, unicorn, also, in, looking, glass, look, like, tenniel, s, punch, illustrations, of, william, ewart, gladstone, and, disraeli, although, gardner, says, there, is, no, proof, that, they, were, intended, to, represent, these, politicians, gardner, has, suggested, that, the, hatter, is, a, reference, to, theophilus, carter, an, oxford, furniture, dealer, and, that, tenniel, apparently, drew, the, hatter, to, resemble, carter, on, a, suggestion, of, carroll, s, the, dormouse, tells, a, story, about, three, little, sisters, named, elsie, lacie, and, tillie, these, are, the, liddell, sisters, elsie, is, l, c, lorina, charlotte, tillie, is, edith, her, family, nickname, is, matilda, and, lacie, is, an, anagram, of, alice, the, mock, turtle, speaks, of, a, drawling, master, an, old, conger, eel, who, came, once, a, week, to, teach, drawling, stretching, and, fainting, in, coils, this, is, a, reference, to, the, art, critic, john, ruskin, who, came, once, a, week, to, the, liddell, house, to, teach, the, children, to, draw, sketch, and, paint, in, oils, the, mock, turtle, sings, turtle, soup, which, is, a, parody, of, a, song, called, star, of, the, evening, beautiful, star, which, the, liddells, sang, for, carroll, carroll, wrote, multiple, poems, and, songs, for, alice, s, adventures, in, wonderland, including, carroll, s, biographer, morton, n, cohen, reads, alice, as, a, roman, clef, populated, with, real, figures, from, carroll, s, life, alice, is, based, on, alice, liddell, the, dodo, is, carroll, wonderland, is, oxford, even, the, mad, hatter, s, tea, party, according, to, cohen, is, a, send, up, of, alice, s, own, birthday, party, the, critic, jan, susina, rejects, cohen, s, account, arguing, that, alice, the, character, bears, a, tenuous, relationship, with, alice, liddell, beyond, its, refashioning, of, carroll, s, everyday, life, cohen, argues, alice, critiques, victorian, ideals, of, childhood, it, is, an, account, of, the, child, s, plight, in, victorian, upper, class, society, in, which, alice, s, mistreatment, by, the, creatures, of, wonderland, reflects, carroll, s, own, mistreatment, by, older, people, as, a, child, in, the, eighth, chapter, three, cards, are, painting, the, roses, on, a, rose, tree, red, because, they, had, accidentally, planted, a, white, rose, tree, that, the, queen, of, hearts, hates, according, to, wilfrid, scott, giles, the, rose, motif, in, alice, alludes, to, the, english, wars, of, the, roses, red, roses, symbolised, the, house, of, lancaster, while, white, roses, symbolise, their, rival, house, of, york, alice, is, full, of, linguistic, play, puns, and, parodies, according, to, gillian, beer, carroll, s, play, with, language, evokes, the, feeling, of, words, for, new, readers, they, still, have, insecure, edges, and, a, nimbus, of, nonsense, blurs, the, sharp, focus, of, terms, the, literary, scholar, jessica, straley, in, a, work, about, the, role, of, evolutionary, theory, in, victorian, children, s, literature, argues, that, carroll, s, focus, on, language, prioritises, humanism, over, scientism, by, emphasising, language, s, role, in, human, self, conception, pat, s, digging, for, apples, is, a, cross, language, pun, as, pomme, de, terre, literally, apple, of, the, earth, means, potato, and, pomme, means, apple, in, the, second, chapter, alice, initially, addresses, the, mouse, as, o, mouse, based, on, her, memory, of, the, noun, declensions, in, her, brother, s, latin, grammar, a, mouse, of, a, mouse, to, a, mouse, a, mouse, o, mouse, these, words, correspond, to, the, first, five, of, latin, s, six, cases, in, a, traditional, order, established, by, medieval, grammarians, mus, nominative, muris, genitive, muri, dative, murem, accusative, o, mus, vocative, the, sixth, case, mure, ablative, is, absent, from, alice, s, recitation, nilson, suggests, that, alice, s, missing, ablative, is, a, pun, on, her, father, henry, liddell, s, work, on, the, standard, a, greek, english, lexicon, since, ancient, greek, does, not, have, an, ablative, case, further, mousa, meaning, muse, was, a, standard, model, noun, in, greek, textbooks, of, the, time, in, paradigms, of, the, first, declension, short, alpha, noun, mathematics, and, logic, are, central, to, alice, as, carroll, was, a, mathematician, at, christ, church, it, has, been, suggested, that, there, are, many, references, and, mathematical, concepts, in, both, this, story, and, through, the, looking, glass, literary, scholar, melanie, bayley, asserts, in, the, new, scientist, magazine, that, carroll, wrote, alice, in, wonderland, in, its, final, form, as, a, satire, on, mid, 19th, century, mathematics, carina, garland, notes, how, the, world, is, expressed, via, representations, of, food, and, appetite, naming, alice, s, frequent, desire, for, consumption, of, both, food, and, words, her, curious, appetites, often, the, idea, of, eating, coincides, to, make, gruesome, images, after, the, riddle, why, is, a, raven, like, a, writing, desk, the, hatter, claims, that, alice, might, as, well, say, i, see, what, i, eat, i, eat, what, i, see, and, so, the, riddle, s, solution, put, forward, by, boe, birns, could, be, that, a, raven, eats, worms, a, writing, desk, is, worm, eaten, this, idea, of, food, encapsulates, idea, of, life, feeding, on, life, itself, for, the, worm, is, being, eaten, and, then, becomes, the, eater, a, horrific, image, of, mortality, nina, auerbach, discusses, how, the, novel, revolves, around, eating, and, drinking, which, motivates, much, of, her, behaviour, for, the, story, is, essentially, about, things, entering, and, leaving, her, mouth, the, animals, of, wonderland, are, of, particular, interest, for, alice, s, relation, to, them, shifts, constantly, because, as, lovell, smith, states, alice, s, changes, in, size, continually, reposition, her, in, the, food, chain, serving, as, a, way, to, make, her, acutely, aware, of, the, eat, or, be, eaten, attitude, that, permeates, wonderland, alice, is, an, example, of, the, literary, nonsense, genre, according, to, humphrey, carpenter, alice, s, brand, of, nonsense, embraces, the, nihilistic, and, existential, characters, in, nonsensical, episodes, such, as, the, mad, hatter, s, tea, party, in, which, it, is, always, the, same, time, go, on, posing, paradoxes, that, are, never, resolved, wonderland, is, a, rule, bound, world, but, its, rules, are, not, those, of, our, world, the, literary, scholar, daniel, bivona, writes, that, alice, is, characterised, by, gamelike, social, structures, she, trusts, in, instructions, from, the, beginning, drinking, from, the, bottle, labelled, drink, me, after, recalling, during, her, descent, that, children, who, do, not, follow, the, rules, often, meet, terrible, fates, unlike, the, creatures, of, wonderland, who, approach, their, world, s, wonders, uncritically, alice, continues, to, look, for, rules, as, the, story, progresses, gillian, beer, suggests, that, alice, looks, for, rules, to, soothe, her, anxiety, while, carroll, may, have, hunted, for, rules, because, he, struggled, with, the, implications, of, the, non, euclidean, geometry, then, in, development, the, manuscript, was, illustrated, by, carroll, who, added, 37, illustrations, printed, in, a, facsimile, edition, in, 1887, john, tenniel, provided, 42, wood, engraved, illustrations, for, the, published, version, of, the, book, the, first, print, run, was, destroyed, or, sold, in, the, us, at, carroll, s, request, because, tenniel, was, dissatisfied, with, the, printing, quality, there, are, only, 22, known, first, edition, copies, in, existence, the, book, was, reprinted, and, published, in, 1866, tenniel, s, detailed, black, and, white, drawings, remain, the, definitive, depiction, of, the, characters, tenniel, s, illustrations, of, alice, do, not, portray, the, real, alice, liddell, who, had, dark, hair, and, a, short, fringe, alice, has, provided, a, challenge, for, other, illustrators, including, those, of, 1907, by, charles, pears, and, the, full, series, of, colour, plates, and, line, drawings, by, harry, rountree, published, in, the, inter, war, children, s, press, glasgow, edition, other,

1970, tove, jansson, 1977, anthony, browne, 1988, helen, oxenbury, 1999, and, lisbeth, zwerger, 1999, carroll, first, met, alexander, macmillan, a, high, powered, london, publisher, on, 19, october, 1863, his, firm, macmillan, publishers, agreed, to, publish, alice, s, adventures, in, wonderland, by, sometime, in, 1864, carroll, financed, the, initial, print, run, possibly, because, it, gave, him, more, editorial, authority, than, other, financing, methods, he, managed, publication, details, such, as, typesetting, and, engaged, illustrators, and, translators, macmillan, had, published, the, water, babies, also, a, children, s, fantasy, in, 1863, and, suggested, its, design, as, a, basis, for, alice, s, carroll, saw, a, specimen, copy, in, may, 1865, 2, 000, copies, were, printed, by, july, but, tenniel, objected, to, their, quality, and, carroll, instructed, macmillan, to, halt, publication, so, they, could, be, reprinted, in, august, he, engaged, richard, clay, as, an, alternative, printer, for, a, new, run, of, 2, 000, the, reprint, cost, 600, paid, entirely, by, carroll, he, received, the, first, copy, of, clay, s, edition, on, 9, november, 1865, macmillan, finally, published, the, new, edition, printed, by, richard, clay, in, november, 1865, carroll, requested, a, red, binding, deeming, it, appealing, to, young, readers, a, new, edition, released, in, december, 1865, for, the, christmas, market, but, carrying, an, 1866, date, was, quickly, printed, the, text, blocks, of, the, original, edition, were, removed, from, the, binding, and, sold, with, carroll, s, permission, to, the, new, york, publishing, house, of, d, appleton, company, the, binding, for, the, appleton, alice, was, identical, to, the, 1866, macmillan, alice, except, for, the, publisher, s, name, at, the, foot, of, the, spine, the, title, page, of, the, appleton, alice, was, an, insert, cancelling, the, original, macmillan, title, page, of, 1865, and, bearing, the, new, york, publisher, s, imprint, and, the, date, 1866, the, entire, print, run, sold, out, quickly, alice, was, a, publishing, sensation, beloved, by, children, and, adults, alike, oscar, wilde, was, a, fan, queen, victoria, was, also, an, avid, reader, of, the, book, she, reportedly, enjoyed, alice, enough, that, she, asked, for, carroll, s, next, book, which, turned, out, to, be, a, mathematical, treatise, carroll, denied, this, the, book, has, never, been, out, of, print, alice, s, adventures, in, wonderland, has, been, translated, into, 174, languages, the, following, list, is, a, timeline,

in, the, late, 19th, century, walter, besant, wrote, that, alice, in, wonderland, was, a, book, of, that, extremely, rare, kind, which, will, belong, to, all, the, generations, to, come, until, the, language, becomes, obsolete, no, story, in, english, literature, has, intrigued, me, more, than, lewis, carroll, s, alice, in, wonderland, it, fascinated, me, the, first, time, i, read, it, as, a, schoolboy, f, j, harvey, darton, argued, in, a, 1932, book, that, alice, ended, an, era, of, didacticism, in, children, s, literature, inaugurating, a, new, era, in, which, writing, for, children, aimed, to, delight, or, entertain, in, 2014, robert, mccrum, named, alice, one, of, the, best, loved, in, the, english, canon, and, called, it, perhaps, the, greatest, possibly, most, influential,
