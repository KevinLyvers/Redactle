flamenco, spanish, pronunciation, is, an, art, form, based, on, the, various, folkloric, music, traditions, of, southern, spain, developed, within, the, gitano, subculture, of, the, region, of, andalusia, and, also, having, historical, presence, in, extremadura, and, murcia, in, a, wider, sense, the, term, is, used, to, refer, to, a, variety, of, both, contemporary, and, traditional, musical, styles, typical, of, southern, spain, flamenco, is, closely, associated, to, the, gitanos, of, the, romani, ethnicity, who, have, contributed, significantly, to, its, origination, and, professionalization, however, its, style, is, uniquely, andalusian, and, flamenco, artists, have, historically, included, spaniards, of, both, gitano, and, non, gitano, heritage, the, oldest, record, of, flamenco, music, dates, to, 1774, in, the, book, las, cartas, marruecas, the, moroccan, letters, by, jos, cadalso, the, development, of, flamenco, over, the, past, two, centuries, is, well, documented, the, theatre, movement, of, sainetes, one, act, plays, and, tonadillas, popular, song, books, and, song, sheets, customs, studies, of, dances, and, toques, perfection, newspapers, graphic, documents, in, paintings, and, engravings, in, continuous, evolution, together, with, rhythm, the, poetic, stanzas, and, the, ambiance, on, 16, november, 2010, unesco, declared, flamenco, one, of, the, masterpieces, of, the, oral, and, intangible, heritage, of, humanity, historically, the, term, flamenco, was, used, to, identify, the, romani, people, gitanos, of, spain, the, english, traveller, george, borrow, who, travelled, through, spain, during, the, 1830s, stated, that, the, gitanos, were, also, called, flemish, in, spanish, flamenco, due, to, german, and, flemish, being, erroneously, considered, synonymous, according, to, flamencologist, cristina, cruces, rold, n, a, year, prior, to, borrow, s, account, there, already, existed, a, gitano, party, in, madrid, that, was, clearly, identified, as, flamenco, this, equivalency, between, gitano, and, flamenco, is, also, noted, by, manuel, fern, ndez, y, gonz, lez, dem, filo, and, the, scholar, iriving, brown, who, stated, in, 1938, that, flamenco, is, simply, another, term, for, gitano, with, special, connotations, the, origins, of, the, term, lie, in, the, sociological, prejudice, towards, the, roma, who, were, seen, as, ruffians, and, cocky, troublemakers, by, the, spaniards, and, were, thus, associated, with, the, 18th, century, german, colonists, of, the, sierra, morena, who, formed, groups, of, urban, bohemians, that, lived, outside, the, law, and, were, seen, as, idle, and, lazy, other, less, successful, hypotheses, include, those, of, felipe, pedrell, and, carlos, alemendros, who, state, that, while, the, term, flamenco, is, spanish, for, flemish, it, is, actually, synonymous, with, cantador, professional, singer, in, reference, to, the, group, of, flemish, singers, brought, by, spanish, king, carlos, i, in, 1516, another, hypothesis, that, is, not, widely, accepted, is, the, arabist, theory, of, blas, infante, which, presents, in, his, book, or, genes, de, lo, flamenco, origins, of, flamenco, flamenco, as, a, phonetic, deformation, of, arabic, fellah, mengu, runaway, laborer, or, was, derived, from, the, arabic, terms, felah, mengus, which, together, mean, wandering, peasant, the, first, use, of, the, term, flamenco, to, refer, to, the, music, genre, appears, in, a, 1847, newspaper, article, of, el, espectador, where, it, was, referred, to, as, a, gitano, genre, in, the, early, years, of, flamenco, the, term, was, versatile, and, was, used, to, refer, to, a, variety, of, concepts, in, the, gitano, andalusian, world, for, example, in, the, 1860s, 70s, this, versatility, was, exemplified, through, its, use, to, refer, to, a, musical, style, and, a, certain, aesthetic, manners, and, way, of, life, that, were, perceived, to, be, gitano, at, that, time, flamenco, was, not, a, strict, genre, but, a, way, of, performing, music, in, a, gitano, andalusian, style, there, are, hypotheses, that, point, to, the, influence, on, flamenco, of, types, of, dance, from, the, indian, subcontinent, the, place, of, origin, of, the, romani, people, the, indo, pakistani, scales, of, flamenco, were, introduced, to, andalusia, by, the, romani, migrations, from, northern, india, these, roma, migrants, also, brought, bells, and, an, extensive, repertoire, of, songs, and, dances, upon, arrival, to, andalusia, in, the, 15th, century, they, were, exposed, to, the, rich, arab, andalusian, music, culture, itself, a, hybrid, of, spanish, music, tradition, going, back, to, the, 8th, century, with, the, establishment, of, al, andalus, which, brought, in, traditions, and, music, from, the, arabian, peninsula, northern, africa, and, sephardic, features, some, of, the, instruments, associated, with, flamenco, and, spanish, folklore, in, different, regions, today, are, the, wooden, castanets, and, tambourines, both, believed, to, originate, during, the, al, andalus, period, this, centuries, long, period, of, cultural, intermingling, formed, the, roots, of, flamenco, song, and, dance, genres, it, is, believed, that, the, flamenco, genre, emerged, at, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, in, cities, and, agrarian, towns, of, baja, andalusia, highlighting, jerez, de, la, frontera, as, the, first, written, vestige, of, this, art, although, there, is, practically, no, data, related, to, those, dates, and, the, manifestations, of, this, time, are, more, typical, of, the, bolero, school, than, of, flamenco, it, appeared, as, a, modern, art, form, from, the, convergence, of, the, urban, subaltern, groups, gitano, communities, and, journeyman, of, andalusia, that, formed, the, marginalized, flamenco, artistic, working, class, who, established, flamenco, as, a, singular, art, form, marked, from, the, beginning, by, the, gitano, brand, andalusia, was, the, origin, and, cradle, of, the, early, flamenco, cantaores, and, of, the, three, or, four, dozen, gitano, families, who, created, and, cultivated, flamenco, during, the, end, of, the, 18th, and, beginning, of, the, 19th, century, a, number, of, factors, led, to, rise, in, spain, of, a, phenomenon, known, as, costumbrismo, andaluz, or, andalusian, mannerism, in, 1783, carlos, iii, promulgated, a, pragmatics, that, regulated, the, social, situation, of, the, gitanos, this, was, a, momentous, event, in, the, history, of, spanish, gitanos, who, after, centuries, of, marginalization, and, persecution, saw, their, legal, situation, improve, substantially, after, the, spanish, war, of, independence, 1808, 1812, a, feeling, of, racial, pride, developed, in, the, spanish, conscience, in, opposition, to, the, gallified, afrancesados, spaniards, who, were, influenced, by, french, culture, and, the, idea, of, the, enlightenment, in, this, context, gitanos, were, seen, as, an, ideal, embodiment, of, spanish, culture, and, the, emergence, of, the, bullfighting, schools, of, ronda, and, seville, the, rise, of, the, bandidos, and, vaqueros, led, to, a, taste, for, andalusian, romantic, culture, which, triumphed, in, the, madrid, court, at, this, time, there, is, evidence, of, disagreements, due, to, the, introduction, of, innovations, in, art, in, 1881, silverio, franconetti, opened, the, first, flamenco, singer, caf, in, seville, in, silverio, s, caf, the, cantaores, were, in, a, very, competitive, environment, which, allowed, the, emergence, of, the, professional, cantaor, and, served, as, a, crucible, where, flamenco, art, was, configured, locals, learned, the, cantes, while, reinterpreting, the, andalusian, folk, songs, in, their, own, style, expanding, the, repertoire, likewise, the, taste, of, the, public, contributed, to, configure, the, flamenco, genre, unifying, its, technique, and, its, theme, flamenquismo, defined, by, the, royal, spanish, academy, as, a, fondness, for, flamenco, art, and, customs, is, a, conceptual, catch, all, where, flamenco, singing, and, a, fondness, for, bullfighting, among, other, traditional, spanish, elements, fit, these, customs, were, strongly, attacked, by, the, generation, of, 98, all, of, its, members, being, anti, flamenco, with, the, exception, of, the, machado, brothers, manuel, and, antonio, being, sevillians, and, sons, of, the, folklorist, dem, filo, machado, the, brothers, had, a, more, complex, view, of, the, matter, the, greatest, standard, bearer, of, anti, flamenquism, was, the, madrid, writer, eugenio, noel, who, in, his, youth, had, been, a, militant, casticista, noel, attributed, to, flamenco, and, bullfighting, the, origin, of, the, ills, of, spain, which, he, saw, as, manifestations, of, the, country, s, oriental, character, which, hindered, economic, and, social, development, these, considerations, caused, an, insurmountable, rift, to, be, established, for, decades, between, flamenco, and, most, intellectuals, of, the, time, between, 1920, and, 1955, flamenco, shows, began, to, be, held, in, bullrings, and, theaters, under, the, name, flamenco, opera, this, denomination, was, an, economic, strategy, of, the, promoters, since, opera, only, paid, 3, while, variety, shows, paid, 10, at, this, time, flamenco, shows, spread, throughout, spain, and, the, main, cities, of, the, world, the, great, social, and, commercial, success, achieved, by, flamenco, at, this, time, eliminated, some, of, the, oldest, and, most, sober, styles, from, the, stage, in, favor, of, lighter, airs, such, as, canti, as, los, cantes, de, ida, y, vuelta, and, fandangos, of, which, many, personal, versions, were, created, the, purist, critics, attacked, this, lightness, of, the, cantes, as, well, as, the, use, of, falsete, and, the, gaitero, style, in, the, line, of, purism, the, poet, federico, garc, a, lorca, and, the, composer, manuel, de, falla, had, the, idea, of, concurso, de, cante, jondo, en, granada, en, 1922, both, artists, conceived, of, flamenco, as, folklore, not, as, a, scenic, artistic, genre, for, this, reason, they, were, concerned, since, they, believed, that, the, massive, triumph, of, flamenco, would, end, its, purest, and, deepest, roots, to, remedy, this, they, organized, a, cante, jondo, contest, in, which, only, amateurs, could, participate, and, in, which, festive, cantes, such, as, canti, as, were, excluded, which, falla, and, lorca, did, not, consider, jondos, but, flamencos, the, jury, was, chaired, by, antonio, chac, n, who, at, that, time, was, the, leading, figure, in, cante, the, winners, were, el, tenazas, a, retired, professional, cantaor, from, mor, n, de, la, frontera, and, manuel, ortega, an, eight, year, old, boy, from, seville, who, would, go, down, in, flamenco, history, as, manolo, caracol, the, contest, turned, out, to, be, a, failure, due, to, the, scant, echo, it, had, and, because, lorca, and, falla, did, not, know, how, to, understand, the, professional, character, that, flamenco, already, had, at, that, time, striving, in, vain, to, seek, a, purity, that, never, existed, in, an, art, that, was, characterized, by, mixture, and, the, personal, innovation, of, its, creators, apart, from, this, failure, with, the, generation, of, 27, whose, most, eminent, members, were, andalusians, and, therefore, knew, the, genre, first, hand, the, recognition, of, flamenco, by, intellectuals, began, at, that, time, there, were, already, flamenco, recordings, related, to, christmas, which, can, be, divided, into, two, groups, the, traditional, flamenco, carol, and, flamenco, songs, that, adapt, their, lyrics, to, the, christmas, theme, these, cantes, have, been, maintained, to, this, day, the, zambomba, jerezana, being, spatially, representative, declared, an, asset, of, intangible, cultural, interest, by, the, junta, de, andaluc, a, in, december, 2015, during, the, spanish, civil, war, a, large, number, of, singers, were, exiled, or, died, defending, the, republic, and, the, humiliations, to, which, they, were, being, subjected, by, the, national, party, bando, nacional, corruco, de, algeciras, chaconcito, el, carbonerillo, el, chato, de, las, ventas, vallejito, rita, la, cantaora, angelillo, guerrita, are, some, of, them, in, the, postwar, period, and, the, first, years, of, the, franco, regime, the, world, of, flamenco, was, viewed, with, suspicion, as, the, authorities, were, not, clear, that, this, genre, contributed, to, the, national, conscience, however, the, regime, soon, ended, up, adopting, flamenco, as, one, of, the, quintessential, spanish, cultural, manifestations, the, singers, who, have, survived, the, war, go, from, stars, to, almost, outcasts, singing, for, the, young, men, in, the, private, rooms, of, the, brothels, in, the, center, of, seville, where, they, have, to, adapt, to, the, whims, of, aristocrats, soldiers, and, businessmen, who, have, become, rich, in, short, the, period, of, the, flamenco, opera, was, a, time, open, to, creativity, and, that, definitely, made, up, most, of, the, flamenco, repertoire, it, was, the, golden, age, of, this, genre, with, figures, such, as, antonio, chac, n, manuel, vallejo, manuel, vallejo, manuel, torre, la, ni, a, de, los, peines, pepe, marchena, and, manolo, caracol, starting, in, the, 1950s, abundant, anthropological, and, musicological, studies, on, flamenco, began, to, be, published, in, 1954, hispavox, published, the, first, antolog, a, del, cante, flamenco, a, sound, recording, that, was, a, great, shock, to, its, time, dominated, by, orchestrated, cante, and, consequently, mystified, in, 1955, the, argentine, intellectual, anselmo, gonz, lez, climent, published, an, essay, called, flamencolog, a, whose, title, he, baptized, the, set, of, knowledge, techniques, etc, on, flamenco, singing, and, dancing, this, book, dignified, the, study, of, flamenco, by, applying, the, academic, methodology, of, musicology, to, it, and, served, as, the, basis, for, subsequent, studies, on, this, genre, as, a, result, in, 1956, the, national, contest, of, cante, jondo, de, c, rdoba, was, organized, and, in, 1958, the, first, flamencology, chair, was, founded, in, jerez, de, la, frontera, the, oldest, academic, institution, dedicated, to, the, study, research, conservation, promotion, and, defense, of, the, flamenco, art, likewise, in, 1963, the, cordovan, poet, ricardo, molina, and, the, sevillian, cantaor, antonio, mairena, published, alalim, n, mundo, y, formas, del, cante, flamenco, which, has, become, a, must, have, reference, work, for, a, long, time, the, mairenistas, postulates, were, considered, practically, unquestionable, until, they, found, an, answer, in, other, authors, who, elaborated, the, andalusian, thesis, which, defended, that, flamenco, was, a, genuinely, andalusian, product, since, it, had, been, developed, entirely, in, this, region, and, because, its, styles, basic, ones, derived, from, the, folklore, of, andalusia, they, also, maintained, that, the, andalusian, gitanos, had, contributed, decisively, to, their, formation, highlighting, the, exceptional, nature, of, flamenco, among, gypsy, music, and, dances, from, other, parts, of, spain, and, europe, the, unification, of, the, gitanos, and, andalusian, thesis, has, ended, up, being, the, most, accepted, today, in, short, between, the, 1950s, and, 1970s, flamenco, went, from, being, a, mere, show, to, also, becoming, an, object, of, study, flamenco, became, one, of, the, symbols, of, spanish, national, identity, during, the, franco, regime, since, the, regime, knew, how, to, appropriate, a, folklore, traditionally, associated, with, andalusia, to, promote, national, unity, and, attract, tourism, constituting, what, was, called, national, flamenquismo, hence, flamenco, had, long, been, seen, as, a, reactionary, or, retrograde, element, in, the, mid, 60s, and, until, the, transition, cantaores, who, opposed, the, regime, began, to, appear, with, the, use, of, protest, lyrics, these, include, jos, menese, and, lyricist, francisco, moreno, galv, n, enrique, morente, manuel, gerena, el, lebrijano, el, cabrero, lole, y, manuel, el, piki, or, luis, mar, n, among, many, others, in, contrast, to, this, conservatism, with, which, it, was, associated, during, the, franco, regime, flamenco, suffered, the, influence, of, the, wave, of, activism, that, also, shook, the, university, against, the, repression, of, the, regime, when, university, students, came, into, contact, with, this, art, in, the, recitals, that, were, held, for, example, at, the, colegio, mayor, de, san, juan, evangelista, flamenco, amateurs, and, professionals, got, involved, with, performances, of, a, manifestly, political, nature, it, was, a, kind, of, flamenco, protest, charged, with, protest, which, meant, censorship, and, repression, for, the, flamenco, activists, as, the, political, transition, progressed, the, demands, were, deflated, as, flamenco, inserted, itself, within, the, flows, of, globalized, art, at, the, same, time, this, art, was, institutionalized, until, it, reached, the, point, that, the, junta, de, andaluc, a, was, attributed, in, 2007, exclusive, competence, in, matters, of, knowledge, conservation, research, training, promotion, and, dissemination, in, the, 1970s, there, were, airs, of, social, and, political, change, in, spain, and, spanish, society, was, already, quite, influenced, by, various, musical, styles, from, the, rest, of, europe, and, the, united, states, there, were, also, numerous, singers, who, had, grown, up, listening, to, antonio, mairena, pepe, marchena, and, manolo, caracol, the, combination, of, both, factors, led, to, a, revolutionary, period, called, flamenco, fusion, the, singer, roc, o, jurado, internationalized, flamenco, at, the, beginning, of, the, 70s, replacing, the, bata, de, cola, with, evening, dresses, her, facet, in, the, fandangos, de, huelva, and, in, the, alegr, as, was, recognized, internationally, for, her, perfect, voice, tessitura, in, these, genres, she, used, to, be, accompanied, in, her, concerts, by, guitarists, enrique, de, melchor, and, tomatito, not, only, at, the, national, level, but, in, countries, like, colombia, venezuela, and, puerto, rico, the, musical, representative, jos, antonio, pulp, n, was, a, decisive, character, in, that, fusion, as, he, urged, the, cantaor, agujetas, to, collaborate, with, the, sevillian, andalusian, rock, group, pata, negra, the, most, revolutionary, couple, since, antonio, chac, n, and, ram, n, montoya, initiating, a, new, path, for, flamenco, it, also, fostered, the, artistic, union, between, the, virtuoso, guitarist, from, algeciras, paco, de, luc, a, and, the, long, standing, singer, from, the, island, camar, n, de, la, isla, who, gave, a, creative, impulse, to, flamenco, that, would, mean, its, definitive, break, with, mairena, s, conservatism, when, both, artists, undertook, their, solo, careers, camar, n, became, a, mythical, cantaor, for, his, art, and, personality, with, a, legion, of, followers, while, paco, de, luc, a, reconfigured, the, entire, musical, world, of, flamenco, opening, up, to, new, influences, such, as, brazilian, music, arabic, and, jazz, and, introducing, new, musical, instruments, such, as, the, peruvian, cajon, the, transverse, flute, etc, other, leading, performers, in, this, process, of, formal, flamenco, renewal, were, juan, pe, a, el, lebrijano, who, married, flamenco, with, andalusian, music, and, enrique, morente, who, throughout, his, long, artistic, career, has, oscillated, between, the, purism, of, his, first, recordings, and, the, crossbreeding, with, rock, or, remedios, amaya, from, triana, cultivator, of, a, unique, style, of, tangos, from, extremadura, and, a, wedge, of, purity, in, her, cante, make, her, part, of, this, select, group, of, established, artists, other, singers, with, their, own, style, include, cancanilla, de, marbella, in, 2011, this, style, became, known, in, india, thanks, to, mar, a, del, mar, fern, ndez, who, acts, in, the, video, clip, of, the, film, you, live, once, entitled, se, orita, the, film, was, seen, by, more, than, 73, million, viewers, in, the, 1980s, a, new, generation, of, flamenco, artists, emerged, who, had, been, influenced, by, the, mythical, cantaor, camar, n, paco, de, luc, a, morente, etc, these, artists, were, interested, in, popular, urban, music, which, in, those, years, was, renewing, the, spanish, music, scene, it, was, the, time, of, the, movida, madrile, a, among, them, are, pata, negra, who, fused, flamenco, with, blues, and, rock, ketama, of, pop, and, cuban, inspiration, and, ray, heredia, creator, of, his, own, musical, universe, where, flamenco, occupies, a, central, place, also, the, recording, company, nuevos, medios, released, many, musicians, under, the, label, nuevo, flamenco, and, this, denomination, has, grouped, musicians, very, different, from, each, other, like, rosario, flores, daughter, of, lola, flores, or, the, renowned, singer, mal, niece, of, paco, de, luc, a, and, daughter, of, pepe, de, luc, a, who, despite, sympathizing, with, flamenco, and, keeping, it, in, her, discography, has, continued, with, her, personal, style, however, the, fact, that, many, of, the, interpreters, of, this, new, music, are, also, renowned, cantaores, in, the, case, of, jos, merc, el, cigala, and, others, has, led, to, labeling, everything, they, perform, as, flamenco, although, the, genre, of, their, songs, differs, quite, a, bit, from, the, classic, flamenco, this, has, generated, very, different, feelings, both, for, and, against, other, contemporary, artists, of, that, moment, were, o, funkillo, and, ojos, de, brujo, arc, ngel, miguel, poveda, mayte, mart, n, marina, heredia, estrella, morente, or, manuel, lombo, etc, but, the, discussion, between, the, difference, of, flamenco, and, new, flamenco, in, spain, has, just, gained, strength, during, since, 2019, due, to, the, success, of, new, flamenco, attracting, the, taste, of, the, youngest, spanish, fans, but, also, in, the, international, musical, scene, emphasizing, the, problem, of, how, should, we, call, this, new, musical, genre, mixed, with, flamenco, one, of, these, artist, who, has, reinvented, flamenco, is, rosal, a, an, indisputable, name, on, the, international, music, scene, pienso, en, tu, mir, di, mi, nombre, or, the, song, that, catapulted, her, to, fame, malamente, are, a, combination, of, styles, that, includes, a, flamenco, south, spain, traditional, musical, base, rosal, a, has, broken, the, limits, of, this, musical, genre, by, embracing, other, urban, rhythms, but, has, also, created, a, lot, of, controversy, about, which, genre, is, she, using, the, catalan, artist, has, been, awarded, several, latin, grammy, awards, and, mtv, video, music, awards, which, also, at, just, 30, years, old, garners, more, than, 40, million, monthly,

jota, which, took, root, in, cadiz, during, the, peninsular, war, and, the, establishment, of, the, cortes, de, cadiz, that, is, why, its, classic, lyrics, contain, so, many, references, to, the, virgen, del, pilar, the, ebro, river, and, navarra, enrique, butr, n, is, considered, to, have, formalized, the, current, flamenco, style, of, alegr, as, and, ignacio, espeleta, who, introduced, the, characteristic, tiriti, tran, tran, some, of, the, best, known, interpreters, of, alegr, as, are, enrique, el, mellizo, chato, de, la, isla, pinini, peric, n, de, c, diz, aurelio, sell, s, la, perla, de, c, diz, chano, lobato, and, el, folli, one, of, the, structurally, strictest, forms, of, flamenco, a, traditional, dance, in, alegr, as, must, contain, each, of, the, following, sections, a, salida, entrance, paseo, walkaround, silencio, similar, to, an, adagio, in, ballet, castellana, upbeat, section, zapateado, literally, a, tap, of, the, foot, and, buler, as, this, structure, though, is, not, followed, when, alegr, as, are, sung, as, a, standalone, song, with, no, dancing, in, that, case, the, stanzas, are, combined, freely, sometimes, together, with, other, types, of, canti, as, alegr, as, has, a, rhythm, consisting, of, 12, beats, it, is, similar, to, soleares, its, beat, emphasis, is, as, follows, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, alegr, as, originated, in, c, diz, alegr, as, belongs, to, the, group, of, palos, called, canti, as, and, it, is, usually, played, in, a, lively, rhythm, 120, 170, beats, per, minute, the, livelier, speeds, are, chosen, for, dancing, while, quieter, rhythms, are, preferred, for, the, song, alone, buler, as, a, fast, flamenco, rhythm, made, up, of, a, 12, beat, cycle, with, emphasis, in, two, general, forms, as, follows, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, or, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 11, it, originated, among, the, cal, romani, people, of, jerez, during, the, 19th, century, originally, as, a, fast, upbeat, ending, to, soleares, or, alegrias, it, is, among, the, most, popular, and, dramatic, of, the, flamenco, forms, and, often, ends, any, flamenco, gathering, often, accompanied, by, vigorous, dancing, and, tapping, there, are, three, fundamental, elements, which, can, help, define, whether, or, not, something, really, is, flameco, a, flamenco, mode, or, musical, tonality, the, comp, s, rhythm, and, the, performer, who, should, be, a, flamenco, all, three, of, these, elements, tonality, comp, s, a, flamenco, performer, and, then, something, less, easily, identifiable, flamencura, must, be, present, together, if, we, are, to, wend, up, with, a, piece, of, music, which, can, be, labelled, flamenco, by, themselves, these, elements, won, t, turn, a, piece, of, music, into, flamenco, three, fundamental, elements, that, help, define, whether, or, not, a, dance, belongs, to, the, flamenco, genre, are, the, presence, of, a, flamenco, mode, musical, tonality, compas, and, a, flamenco, performer, martinez, 2003, these, three, elements, contribute, to, the, authenticity, of, a, flamenco, performance, also, known, as, flamencura, martinez, 2003, there, is, also, no, such, thing, as, a, passive, audience, during, flamenco, performances, the, audience, joins, in, the, performance, by, clapping, their, hands, and, even, sometimes, singing, along, totton, 2003, a, typical, flamenco, recital, with, voice, and, guitar, accompaniment, comprises, a, series, of, pieces, not, exactly, songs, in, different, palos, each, song, is, a, set, of, verses, called, copla, tercio, or, letras, punctuated, by, guitar, interludes, falsetas, the, guitarist, also, provides, a, short, introduction, setting, the, tonality, comp, s, see, below, and, tempo, of, the, cante, manuel, 2006, 98, in, some, palos, these, falsetas, are, played, with, a, specific, structure, too, for, example, the, typical, sevillanas, is, played, in, an, aab, pattern, where, a, and, b, are, the, same, falseta, with, only, a, slight, difference, in, the, ending, martin, 2002, 48, flamenco, uses, the, flamenco, mode, which, can, also, be, described, as, the, modern, phrygian, mode, modo, frigio, or, a, harmonic, version, of, that, scale, with, a, major, 3rd, degree, in, addition, to, the, major, and, minor, scales, commonly, used, in, modern, western, music, the, phrygian, mode, occurs, in, palos, such, as, sole, most, buler, as, siguiriyas, tangos, and, tientos, a, typical, chord, sequence, usually, called, the, andalusian, cadence, may, be, viewed, as, in, a, modified, phrygian, in, e, the, sequence, is, am, g, f, e, manuel, 2006, 96, according, to, manolo, sanl, car, e, is, here, the, tonic, f, has, the, harmonic, function, of, dominant, while, am, and, g, assume, the, functions, of, subdominant, and, mediant, respectively, torres, cort, s, 2001, guitarists, tend, to, use, only, two, basic, inversions, or, chord, shapes, for, the, tonic, chord, music, the, open, 1st, inversion, e, and, the, open, 3rd, inversion, a, though, they, often, transpose, these, by, using, a, capo, modern, guitarists, such, as, ram, n, montoya, have, introduced, other, positions, montoya, himself, started, to, use, other, chords, for, the, tonic, in, the, modern, dorian, sections, of, several, palos, f, for, tarantas, b, for, grana, nas, and, a, for, the, minera, montoya, also, created, a, new, palo, as, a, solo, for, guitar, the, ronde, a, in, c, with, scordatura, later, guitarists, have, further, extended, the, repertoire, of, tonalities, chord, positions, and, scordatura, there, are, also, palos, in, major, mode, most, canti, as, and, alegr, as, guajiras, some, buler, as, and, ton, s, and, the, cabales, a, major, type, of, siguiriyas, the, minor, mode, is, restricted, to, the, farruca, the, milongas, among, cantes, de, ida, y, vuelta, and, some, styles, of, tangos, buler, as, etc, in, general, traditional, palos, in, major, and, minor, mode, are, limited, harmonically, to, two, chord, tonic, dominant, or, three, chord, tonic, subdominant, dominant, progressions, rossy, 1998, 92, however, modern, guitarists, have, introduced, chord, substitution, transition, chords, and, even, modulation, fandangos, and, derivative, palos, such, as, malague, as, tarantas, and, cartageneras, are, bimodal, guitar, introductions, are, in, phrygian, mode, while, the, singing, develops, in, major, mode, modulating, to, phrygian, at, the, end, of, the, stanza, rossy, 1998, 92, dionisio, preciado, quoted, by, sabas, de, hoces, 1982, established, the, following, characteristics, for, the, melodies, of, flamenco, singing, musicologist, hip, lito, rossy, adds, the, following, characteristics, rossy, 1998, 97, comp, s, is, the, spanish, word, for, metre, or, time, signature, in, classical, music, theory, it, also, refers, to, the, rhythmic, cycle, or, layout, of, a, palo, the, comp, s, is, fundamental, to, flamenco, comp, s, is, most, often, translated, as, rhythm, but, it, demands, far, more, precise, interpretation, than, any, other, western, style, of, music, if, there, is, no, guitarist, available, the, comp, s, is, rendered, through, hand, clapping, palmas, or, by, hitting, a, table, with, the, knuckles, the, guitarist, uses, techniques, like, strumming, rasgueado, or, tapping, the, soundboard, golpe, changes, of, chords, emphasize, the, most, important, downbeats, flamenco, uses, three, basic, counts, or, measures, binary, ternary, and, a, form, of, a, twelve, beat, cycle, that, is, unique, to, flamenco, there, are, also, free, form, styles, including, among, others, the, ton, s, saetas, malague, as, tarantos, and, some, types, of, fandangos, there, are, three, types, of, 12, beat, rhythms, which, vary, in, their, layouts, or, use, of, accentuations, sole, seguiriya, and, buler, a, the, buler, as, is, the, emblematic, palo, of, flamenco, today, its, 12, beat, cycle, is, most, often, played, with, accents, on, the, 3rd, 6th, 8th, 10th, and, 12th, beats, the, accompanying, palmas, are, played, in, groups, of, 6, beats, giving, rise, to, a, multitude, of, counter, rhythms, and, percussive, voices, within, the, 12, beat, comp, s, in, certain, regions, like, jerez, spain, the, rhythm, stays, in, a, simpler, six, count, rhythm, only, including, the, twelve, count, in, a, musical, resolve, this, is, like, starting, the, counting, at, 9, so, it, goes, this, way, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, again, bold, means, the, emphasis, when, clapping, in, real, life, it, is, counted, from, 1, like, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and, so, on, the, posture, and, technique, of, flamenco, guitarists, called, tocaores, differs, from, that, used, by, the, players, of, classical, guitar, while, the, classical, guitarist, supports, the, guitar, on, his, left, leg, in, an, inclined, way, the, flamenco, guitarist, usually, crosses, his, legs, and, supports, it, on, the, one, that, is, higher, placing, the, neck, in, an, almost, horizontal, position, with, respect, to, the, ground, modern, guitarists, usually, use, classical, guitars, although, there, is, a, specific, instrument, for, this, genre, called, flamenco, guitar, this, is, less, heavy, and, its, body, is, narrower, than, that, of, the, classical, guitar, so, its, sound, is, lower, and, does, not, overshadow, the, cantaor, it, is, usually, made, of, cypress, wood, with, the, handle, of, cedar, and, the, top, of, fir, the, cypress, gives, it, a, brilliant, sound, very, suitable, for, the, characteristics, of, flamenco, formerly, the, palo, santo, from, rio, or, india, was, also, used, being, the, first, of, higher, quality, but, currently, it, is, in, disuse, due, to, its, scarcity, the, palo, santo, gave, guitars, an, amplitude, of, sound, especially, suitable, for, solo, playing, at, present, the, most, widely, used, headstock, is, the, metal, one, since, the, wooden, one, poses, tuning, problems, the, main, guitar, makers, were, antonio, de, torres, jurado, almer, a, 1817, 1892, considered, the, father, of, the, guitar, manuel, ram, rez, de, galarreta, the, great, ram, rez, madrid, 1864, 1920, and, his, disciples, santos, hern, ndez, madrid, 1873, 1943, who, built, several, guitars, for, the, maestro, sabicas, domingo, esteso, and, modesto, borreguero, also, noteworthy, are, the, conde, brothers, faustino, 1913, 1988, mariano, 1916, 1989, and, julio, 1918, 1996, nephews, of, domingo, esteso, whose, children, and, heirs, continue, the, saga, the, guitarists, use, the, technique, of, alzap, a, picado, the, strum, and, the, tremolo, among, others, one, of, the, first, touches, that, is, considered, flamenco, such, as, the, ronde, a, was, the, first, composition, recorded, for, solo, guitar, by, juli, n, arcas, mar, a, almer, a, 1832, antequera, m, laga, 1882, in, barcelona, in, 1860, the, strum, can, be, performed, with, 5, 4, or, 3, fingers, the, latter, invented, by, sabicas, the, use, of, the, thumb, is, also, characteristic, of, flamenco, playing, guitarists, rest, their, thumb, on, the, guitar, s, soundboard, and, their, index, and, middle, fingers, on, the, string, above, the, one, they, are, playing, thus, achieving, greater, power, and, sound, than, the, classical, guitarist, the, middle, finger, is, also, placed, on, the, pickguard, of, the, guitar, for, more, precision, and, strength, when, plucking, the, string, likewise, the, use, of, the, pickguard, as, an, element, of, percussion, gives, great, strength, to, flamenco, guitar, playing, the, melodic, or, flourishing, phrase, that, is, inserted, between, the, chord, sequences, intended, to, accompany, the, couplet, is, called, falseta, the, accompaniment, and, solo, playing, of, flamenco, guitarists, is, based, on, both, the, modal, harmonic, system, and, the, tonal, system, although, the, most, frequent, is, a, combination, of, both, some, flamenco, songs, are, performed, a, palo, seco, a, cappella, without, guitar, accompaniment, according, to, the, royal, spanish, academy, cante, is, called, the, action, or, effect, of, singing, any, andalusian, singing, defining, flamenco, singing, as, agitated, andalusian, singing, and, cante, jondo, as, the, most, genuine, song, andalusian, of, deep, feeling, the, interpreter, of, flamenco, singing, is, called, cantaor, instead, of, singer, with, the, loss, of, the, intervocalic, characteristic, of, the, andalusian, dialect, the, most, important, award, in, flamenco, singing, is, probably, the, llave, de, oro, del, cante, which, has, been, awarded, five, times, to, tom, s, el, nitri, manuel, vallejo, antonio, mairena, camar, n, de, la, isla, and, fosforito, el, baile, flamenco, is, known, for, its, emotional, intensity, proud, carriage, expressive, use, of, the, arms, and, rhythmic, stamping, of, the, feet, unlike, tap, dance, or, irish, dance, which, use, different, techniques, as, with, any, dance, form, many, different, styles, of, flamenco, have, developed, in, the, 20th, century, flamenco, danced, informally, at, gitano, roma, celebrations, in, spain, was, considered, the, most, authentic, form, of, flamenco, there, was, less, virtuoso, technique, in, gitano, flamenco, but, the, music, and, steps, are, fundamentally, the, same, the, arms, are, noticeably, different, from, classical, flamenco, curving, around, the, head, and, body, rather, than, extending, often, with, a, bent, elbow, flamenco, puro, otherwise, known, as, flamenco, por, derecho, is, considered, the, form, of, performance, flamenco, closest, to, its, gitano, influences, in, this, style, the, dance, is, often, performed, solo, and, is, based, on, signals, and, calls, of, structural, improvisation, rather, than, choreographed, in, the, improvisational, style, castanets, are, not, often, used, classical, flamenco, is, the, style, most, frequently, performed, by, spanish, flamenco, dance, companies, it, is, danced, largely, in, a, proud, and, upright, style, for, women, the, back, is, often, held, in, a, marked, back, bend, unlike, the, more, gitano, influenced, styles, there, is, little, movement, of, the, hips, the, body, is, tightly, held, and, the, arms, are, long, like, a, ballet, dancer, in, fact, many, of, the, dancers, in, these, companies, are, trained, in, ballet, cl, sico, espa, ol, more, than, in, the, improvisational, language, of, flamenco, flamenco, has, both, influenced, and, been, influenced, by, ballet, cl, sico, espa, ol, as, evidenced, by, the, fusion, of, the, two, ballets, created, by, la, argentinita, in, the, early, part, of, the, 20th, century, and, later, by, joaqu, n, cort, s, eventually, by, the, entire, ballet, nacional, de, espa, a, et, al, in, the, 1950s, jose, greco, was, one, of, the, most, famous, male, flamenco, dancers, performing, on, stage, worldwide, and, on, television,

of, new, mexico, today, there, are, many, centers, of, flamenco, art, albuquerque, new, mexico, is, considered, the, center, of, the, nation, for, flamenco, art, much, of, this, is, due, to, maria, benitez, s, 37, years, of, sold, out, summer, seasons, albuquerque, boasts, three, distinct, prominent, centers, national, institute, of, flamenco, casa, flamenca, and, flamenco, works, each, center, dedicates, time, to, daily, training, cultural, diffusion, and, world, class, performance, equaled, only, to, world, class, performances, one, would, find, in, the, heart, of, southern, spain, andaluc, a, modern, flamenco, is, a, highly, technical, dance, style, requiring, years, of, study, the, emphasis, for, both, male, and, female, performers, is, on, lightning, fast, footwork, performed, with, absolute, precision, in, addition, the, dancer, may, have, to, dance, while, using, props, such, as, castanets, canes, shawls, and, fans, flamenco, nuevo, is, a, recent, marketing, phenomenon, in, flamenco, marketed, as, a, newer, version, of, flamenco, its, roots, came, from, world, music, promoters, trying, to, sell, albums, of, artists, who, created, music, that, sounded, like, or, had, spanish, style, influences, though, some, of, this, music, was, played, in, similar, pitches, scales, and, was, well, received, it, has, little, to, nothing, to, do, with, the, art, of, flamenco, guitar, dance, cante, jondo, or, the, improvisational, language, nuevo, flamenco, consists, largely, of, compositions, and, repertoire, while, traditional, flamenco, music, and, dance, is, a, language, composed, of, stanzas, actuated, by, oral, formulaic, calls, and, signals, the, flamenco, most, foreigners, are, familiar, with, is, a, style, that, was, developed, as, a, spectacle, for, tourists, to, add, variety, group, dances, are, included, and, even, solos, are, more, likely, to, be, choreographed, the, frilly, voluminous, spotted, dresses, are, derived, from, a, style, of, dress, worn, for, the, sevillanas, at, the, annual, feria, in, seville, in, traditional, flamenco, only, the, very, young, or, older, dancers, are, considered, to, have, the, emotional, innocence, or, maturity, to, adequately, convey, the, duende, soul, of, the, genre, anon, 2010, therefore, unlike, other, dance, forms, where, dancers, turn, professional, through, techniques, early, on, to, take, advantage, of, youth, and, strength, many, flamenco, dancers, do, not, hit, their, peak, until, their, thirties, and, will, continue, to, perform, into, their, fifties, and, beyond, one, artist, that, is, considered, a, young, master, is, juan, manuel, fernandez, montoya, otherwise, known, as, farruquito, at, age, 12, farruquito, was, considered, a, pioneer, and, for, flamenco, puro, or, flamenco, por, derecho, because, of, his, emotional, depth, in, spain, regulated, flamenco, studies, are, officially, taught, in, various, music, conservatories, dance, conservatories, and, music, schools, in, various, autonomous, communities, flamenco, guitar, studies, in, official, educational, centers, began, in, spain, in, 1988, at, the, hands, of, the, great, concert, performer, and, teacher, from, granada, manuel, cano, tamayo, who, obtained, a, position, as, emeritus, professor, at, the, superior, conservatory, de, m, sica, rafael, orozco, from, c, rdoba, there, are, specialized, flamenco, conservatories, throughout, the, country, although, mainly, in, the, andalusia, region, such, as, the, aforementioned, c, rdoba, conservatory, the, murcia, superior, music, conservatory, or, the, superior, music, school, of, catalonia, among, others, outside, of, spain, a, unique, case, is, the, rotterdam, conservatory, in, the, netherlands, which, offers, regulated, flamenco, guitar, studies, under, the, direction, of, maestro, paco, pe, a, since, 1985, a, few, years, before, they, existed, in, spain, in, 2018, the, first, university, master, s, degree, in, flamenco, research, and, analysis, begins, after, the, previous, attempts, of, the, doctorate, program, of, approach, to, flamenco, taught, by, several, universities, such, as, huelva, seville, c, diz, and, c, rdoba, among, others, the, fandango, which, in, the, 17th, century, was, the, most, widespread, song, and, dance, throughout, spain, eventually, ended, up, generating, local, and, regional, variants, especially, in, the, province, of, huelva, in, alta, andaluc, a, and, bordering, areas, the, fandangos, were, accompanied, with, the, bandola, an, instrument, with, which, they, accompanied, themselves, following, a, regular, beat, that, allowed, dancing, and, from, whose, name, the, style, derives, abandoned, thus, arose, the, fandangos, of, lucena, the, drones, of, puente, genil, the, primitive, malague, as, the, ronde, as, the, jaberas, the, jabegotes, the, verdiales, the, chacarr, the, grana, na, the, taranto, and, the, taranta, due, to, the, expansion, of, the, sevillanas, in, baja, andalusia, the, fandango, gradually, lost, its, role, as, a, support, for, the, dance, which, allowed, the, singer, to, shine, and, freedom, generating, a, multitude, of, fandangos, of, personal, creation, in, the, 20th, century, likewise, thousands, of, andalusian, peasants, especially, from, the, eastern, andalusian, provinces, emigrated, to, the, mining, sites, murcian, where, the, tarantos, and, taranta, s, evolved, the, tarante, de, linares, evolved, into, the, mining, of, the, union, the, cartagena, and, the, levantica, at, the, time, of, the, caf, s, cantantes, some, of, these, cantes, were, separated, from, the, dance, and, acquired, a, free, beat, which, allowed, the, performers, to, show, off, the, great, promoter, of, this, process, was, antonio, chac, n, who, developed, precious, versions, of, malague, as, granainas, and, cantes, mineros, the, stylization, of, romance, and, cord, sheets, gave, rise, to, corrido, the, extraction, of, the, romances, from, quatrains, or, three, significant, verses, gave, rise, to, the, primitive, ton, s, the, ca, a, and, the, polo, which, share, meter, and, melody, but, differing, in, their, execution, the, guitar, accompaniment, gave, them, a, beat, that, made, them, danceable, it, is, believed, that, their, origin, was, in, ronda, a, city, in, alta, andaluc, a, close, to, baja, andaluc, a, and, closely, related, to, it, and, that, from, there, they, reached, the, sevillian, suburb, of, triana, with, a, great, tradition, of, corridos, where, they, became, the, sole, from, the, festive, performance, of, corridos, and, soleares, the, jaleos, arose, in, triana, who, traveled, to, extremadura, and, in, jerez, and, utrera, led, to, the, buler, a, from, where, they, spread, throughout, baja, andaluc, a, generating, local, variations, adolfo, salazar, states, that, the, expressive, voice, ole, with, which, andalusian, cantaores, and, bailaores, are, encouraged, can, come, from, the, hebrew, verb, oleh, which, means, to, throw, upwards, showing, that, the, dervish, girovaghi, of, tunisia, maghreb, also, dance, around, to, the, sound, of, repeated, ole, or, joleh, the, use, of, the, word, arza, which, is, the, andalusian, dialect, form, of, pronouncing, the, voice, imperative, rise, with, the, characteristic, andalusian, equalization, of, l, and, r, implosives, the, indiscriminate, use, of, the, voices, arza, and, ole, is, frequent, when, it, comes, to, jalear, but, the, most, evidence, of, the, origin, of, this, word, can, be, from, the, cal, ol, which, means, come, likewise, in, andalusia, it, is, known, as, jaleo, al, ojeo, de, hunt, that, is, the, act, of, glancing, which, is, driving, away, the, game, with, voices, shots, blows, or, noise, so, that, they, get, up, according, to, the, rae, dictionary, 1956, the, duende, in, andalusia, is, a, mysterious, and, ineffable, charm, a, charisma, that, the, gitanos, call, duende, federico, garc, a, lorca, in, his, lecture, teor, a, y, juego, del, duende, confirms, this, ineffability, of, the, duende, by, defining, it, with, the, following, words, from, goethe, mysterious, power, that, everyone, feels, and, that, no, philosopher, explains, in, the, flamenco, imaginary, the, duende, goes, beyond, technique, and, inspiration, in, lorca, s, words, to, search, for, the, duende, there, is, no, map, or, exercise, when, a, flamenco, artist, experiences, the, arrival, of, this, mysterious, charm, the, expressions, have, duende, or, sing, play, or, dance, with, duende, are, used, along, with, those, previously, mentioned, there, are, many, other, words, and, expressions, characteristic, of, the, flamenco, genre, such, as, tablao, flamenco, flamenco, spree, third, aflamencar, and, flamenco
