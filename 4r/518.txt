the, art, of, the, african, diasporas, such, as, african, american, caribbean, or, art, in, south, american, societies, inspired, by, african, traditions, despite, this, diversity, there, are,

fiber, art, are, important, visual, art, forms, across, africa, and, may, be, included, in, the, study, of, african, art, the, term, african, art, does, not, usually, include, the, art, of, the, north, african, areas, along, the, mediterranean, coast, as, such, areas, had, long, been, part, of, different, traditions, for, more, than, a, millennium, the, art, of, such, areas, had, formed, part, of, berber, or, islamic, art, although, with, many, particular, local, characteristics, ethiopian, art, with, a, long, christian, tradition, is, also, different, from, that, of, most, of, africa, where, traditional, african, religion, with, islam, in, the, north, was, dominant, until, the, 20th, century, african, art, includes, prehistoric, and, ancient, art, the, islamic, art, of, west, africa, the, christian, art, of, east, africa, and, the, traditional, artifacts, of, these, and, other, regions, many, african, sculptures, were, historically, made, of, wood, and, other, natural, materials, that, have, not, survived, from, earlier, than, a, few, centuries, ago, although, rare, older, pottery, and, metal, figures, can, be, found, in, some, areas, some, of, the, earliest, decorative, objects, such, as, shell, beads, and, evidence, of, paint, have, been, discovered, in, africa, dating, to, the, middle, stone, age, masks, are, important, elements, in, the, art, of, many, people, along, with, human, figures, and, are, often, highly, stylized, there, is, a, vast, variety, of, styles, often, varying, within, the, same, context, of, origin, and, depending, on, the, use, of, the, object, but, wide, regional, trends, are, apparent, sculpture, is, most, common, among, groups, of, settled, cultivators, in, the, areas, drained, by, the, niger, and, congo, rivers, in, west, africa, direct, images, of, deities, are, relatively, infrequent, but, masks, in, particular, are, or, were, often, made, for, ritual, ceremonies, since, the, late, 19th, century, there, has, been, an, increasing, amount, of, african, art, in, western, collections, the, finest, pieces, of, which, are, displayed, as, part, of, the, history, of, colonization, african, art, has, had, an, important, influence, on, european, modernist, art, which, was, inspired, by, their, interest, in, abstract, depiction, it, was, this, appreciation, of, african, sculpture, that, has, been, attributed, to, the, very, concept, of, african, art, as, seen, by, european, and, american, artists, and, art, historians, west, african, cultures, developed, bronze, casting, for, reliefs, like, the, famous, benin, bronzes, to, decorate, palaces, and, for, highly, naturalistic, royal, heads, from, around, the, bini, town, of, benin, city, edo, state, as, well, as, in, terracotta, or, metal,

like, cylinders, in, central, africa, however, the, main, distinguishing, characteristics, include, heart, shaped, faces, that, are, curved, inward, and, display, patterns, of, circles, and, dots, the, study, of, african, art, until, recently, focused, on, the, traditional, art, of, certain, well, known, groups, on, the, continent, with, a, particular, emphasis, on, traditional, sculpture, masks, and, other, visual, culture, from, non, islamic, west, africa, central, africa, and, southern, africa, with, a, particular, emphasis, on, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, recently, however, there, has, been, a, movement, among, african, art, historians, and, other, scholars, to, include, the, visual, culture, of, other, regions, and, time, periods, the, notion, is, that, by, including, all, african, cultures, and, their, visual, culture, over, time, in, african, art, there, will, be, a, greater, understanding, of, the, continent, s, visual, aesthetics, across, time, finally, the, arts, of, the, people, of, the, african, diaspora, in, brazil, the, caribbean, and, the, south, eastern, united, states, have, also, begun, to, be, included, in, the, study, of, african, art, african, art, is, produced, using, a, wide, range, of, materials, and, takes, many, distinct, shapes, because, wood, is, a, very, common, material, wood, sculptures, make, up, the, majority, of, african, art, other, materials, used, in, creating, african, arts, includes, clay, soil, jewelry, is, a, popular, art, form, and, is, used, to, indicate, rank, affiliation, with, a, group, or, purely, aesthetics,

kente, cloth, mosaics, made, of, butterfly, wings, or, colored, sand, are, popular, in, west, africa, early, african, sculptures, can, be, identified, as, being, made, of, terracotta, and, bronze, traditional, african, religions, have, been, extremely, influential, on, african, art, forms, across, the, continent, african, art, often, stems, from, the, themes, of, religious, symbolism, functionalism, and, utilitarianism, and, many, pieces, of, art, are, created, for, spiritual, rather, than, purely, creative, purposes, many, african, cultures, emphasize, the, importance, of, ancestors, as, intermediaries, between, the, living, the, gods, and, the, supreme, creator, and, art, is, seen, as, a, way, to, contact, these, spirits, of, ancestors, art, may, also, be, used, to, depict, gods, and, is, valued, for, its, functional, purposes, however, it, is, important, to, note, that, the, arrival, of, both, christianity, and, islam, have, also, greatly, influenced, the, art, of, the, african, continent, and, traditions, of, both, have, been, integrated, into, the, beliefs, and, artwork, of, traditional, african, religion, the, origins, of, african, art, lie, long, before,

paints, by, a, complex, process, exists, from, about, 100, 000, years, ago, and, of, the, use, of, pigments, from, around, 320, 000, years, ago, african, rock, art, in, the, sahara, in, niger, preserves, 6000, year, old, carvings, along, with, sub, saharan, africa, the, western, cultural, arts, ancient, egyptian, paintings, and, artifacts, and, indigenous, southern, crafts, also, contributed, greatly, to, african, art, often, depicting, the, abundance, of, surrounding, nature, the, art, was, often, abstract, interpretations, of, animals, plant, life, or, natural, designs, and, shapes, the, nubian, kingdom, of, kush, in, modern, sudan, was, in, close, and, often, hostile, contact, with, egypt, and, produced, monumental, sculptures, mostly, derivative, of, styles, that, did, not, lead, to, the, north, in, west, africa, the, earliest, known, sculptures, are, from, the, nok, culture, which, thrived, between, 1, 500, bc, and, 500, ad, in, modern, nigeria, with, clay, figures, typically, with, elongated, bodies, and, angular, shapes, more, complex, methods, of, producing, art, were, developed, in, sub, saharan, africa, around, the, 10th, century, some, of, the, most, notable, advancements, include, the, bronze, work, of, igbo, ukwu, and, the, terracotta, and, metalworks, of, ile, ife, bronze, and, brass, castings, often, ornamented, with, ivory, and, precious, stones, became, highly, prestigious, in, much, of, west, africa, sometimes, being, limited, to, the, work, of, court, artisans, and, identified, with, royalty, as, with, the, benin, bronzes, during, and, after, the, 19th, and, 20th, century, colonial, period, westerners, long, characterized, african, art, as, primitive, the, term, carries, with, it, negative, connotations, of, underdevelopment, and, poverty, colonization, during, the, nineteenth, century, set, up, a, western, understanding, hinged, on, the, belief, that, african, art, lacked, technical, ability, due, to, its, low, socioeconomic, status, at, the, start, of, the, twentieth, century, art, historians, like, carl, einstein, micha, sobeski, and, leo, frobenius, published, important, works, about, the, thematic, giving, african, art, the, status, of, an, aesthetic, object, not, only, of, an, ethnographic, object, at, the, same, time, artists, like, paul, gauguin, pablo, picasso, georges, braque, andr, derain, henri, matisse, joseph, csaky, and, amedeo, modigliani, became, aware, of, and, inspired, by, african, art, amongst, other, art, forms, in, a, situation, where, the, established, avant, garde, was, straining, against, the, constraints, imposed, by, serving, the, world, of, appearances, african, art, demonstrated, the, power, of, supremely, well, organized, forms, produced, not, only, by, responding, to, the, faculty, of, sight, but, also, and, often, primarily, the, faculty, of, imagination, emotion, and, mystical, and, religious, experience, these, artists, saw, in, african, art, a, formal, perfection, and, sophistication, unified, with, phenomenal, expressive, power, the, study, of, and, response, to, african, art, by, artists, at, the, beginning, of, the, twentieth, century, facilitated, an, explosion, of, interest, in, the, abstraction, organization, and, reorganization, of, forms, and, the, exploration, of, emotional, and, psychological, areas, hitherto, unseen, in, western, art, by, these, means, the, status, of, visual, art, was, changed, art, ceased, to, be, merely, and, primarily, aesthetic, but, became, also, a, true, medium, for, philosophic, and, intellectual, discourse, and, hence, more, truly, and, profoundly, aesthetic, than, ever, before, traditional, art, describes, the, most, popular, and, studied, forms, of, african, art, which, are, typically, found, in, museum, collections, wooden, masks, which, might, either, be, of, human, animal, or, legendary, creatures, are, one, of, the, most, commonly, found, forms, of, art, in, western, africa, in, their, original, contexts, ceremonial, masks, are, used, for, celebrations, initiations, crop, harvesting, and, war, preparation, the, masks, are, worn, by, a, chosen, or, initiated, dancer, during, the, mask, ceremony, the, dancer, goes, into, a, deep, trance, and, during, this, state, of, mind, he, communicates, with, his, ancestors, the, masks, can, be, worn, in, three, different, ways, vertically, covering, the, face, as, helmets, encasing, the, entire, head, and, as, a, crest, resting, upon, the, head, which, was, commonly, covered, by, material, as, part, of, the, disguise, african, masks, often, represent, a, spirit, and, it, is, strongly, believed, that, the, spirit, of, the, ancestors, possesses, the, wearer, most, african, masks, are, made, with, wood, and, can, be, decorated, with, ivory, animal, hair, plant, fibers, such, as, raffia, pigments, like, kaolin, stones, and, semi, precious, gems, also, are, included, in, the, masks, statues, usually, of,

arts, borrow, heavily, from, traditional, predecessors, ironically, this, emphasis, on, abstraction, is, seen, by, westerners, as, an, imitation, of, european, and, american, cubist, and, totemic, artists, such, as, pablo, picasso, amedeo, modigliani, and, henri, matisse, who, in, the, early, twentieth, century, was, heavily, influenced, by, traditional, african, art, this, period, was,

such, as, jean, pigozzi, artur, walther, and, gianni, baiocchi, in, rome, have, helped, expand, the, interest, in, the, subject, numerous, exhibitions, at, the, museum, for, african, art, in, new, york, and, the, african, pavilion, at, the, 2007, venice, biennale, which, showcased, the, sindika, dokolo, african, collection, of, contemporary, art, has, gone, a, long, way, to, counter, many, of, the, myths, and, prejudices, that, haunt, contemporary, african, art, the, appointment, of, nigerian, okwui, enwezor, as, artistic, director, of, documenta, 11, and, his, african, centred, vision, of,

highly, imaginative, and, stylized, depictions, of, western, films, this, creative, interpretation, of, western, culture, through, african, art, styles, is, also, on, display, with, the, tradition,

nigeria, around, 1500, bc, and, vanished, under, unknown, circumstances, around, 500, ad, thus, having, lasted, approximately, 2, 000, years, the, function, of, nok, terracotta, sculptures, remains, unknown, for, the, most, part, the, terracotta, is, preserved, in, the, form, of, scattered, fragments, that, is, why, nok, art, is, best, known, today, only, for, the, heads, both, male, and, female, whose, hairstyles, are, particularly, detailed, and, refined, the, statues, are, in, fragments, because, the, discoveries, are, usually, made, from, alluvial, mud, in, terrain, made, by, the, erosion,

young, sanchez, associate, curator, of, art, of, the, americas, africa, and, oceania, in, the, cleveland, museum, of, art, explains, that, most, nok, ceramics, were, shaped, by, hand, from, coarse, grained, clay, and, subtractively, sculpted, in, a, manner, that, suggests, an, influence, from, wood, carving, after, some, drying, the, sculptures, were, covered, with, slip, and, burnished, to, produce, a, smooth, glossy, surface, the, figures, are, hollow, with, several, openings, to, facilitate, thorough, drying, and, firing, the, firing, process, most, likely, resembled, that, used, today, in, nigeria, in, which, the, pieces, are, covered, with, grass, twigs, and, leaves, and, burned, for, several, hours, as, a, result, of, natural, erosion, and, deposition, nok, terracottas, were, scattered, at, various, depths, throughout, the, sahel, grasslands, causing, difficulty, in, the, dating, and, classification, of, the, mysterious, artifacts, two, archaeological, sites, samun,

500, years, ago, making, them, some, of, the, oldest, in, western, africa, many, further, dates, were, retrieved, in, the, course, of, new, archaeological, excavations, extending, the, beginnings, of, the, nok, tradition, even, further, back, in, time, because, of, the, similarities, between, the, two, sites, archaeologist, graham, connah, believes, that, nok, artwork, represents, a, style, that, was, adopted, by, a, range, of, iron, using, farming, societies, of, varying, cultures, rather, than, being, the, diagnostic, feature, of, a, particular, human, group, as, has, often, been, claimed,

art, are, extreme, sculptures, masks, and, headdresses, display, either, stylized, or, realistic, features, and, either, weathered, or, encrusted, patinas, until, quite, recently, the, function, of, bambara, pieces, was, shrouded, in, mystery, but, in, the, last, twenty, years, field, studies, have, revealed, that, certain, types, of, figures, and, headdresses, were, associated, with, a, number, of, the, societies, that, structure, bambara, life, during, the, 1970s, a, group, of, approximately, twenty, figures, masks, and, tjiwara, headdresses, belonging, to, the, so, called, segou, style,

third, type, has, connections, with, the, nama, society, and, is, carved, in, the, form, of, an, articulated, bird, s, head, while, the, fourth, minor, type, represents, a, stylized, animal, head, and, is, used, by, the, kore, society, other, bambara, masks, are, known, to, exist, but, unlike, those, described, above, they, cannot, be, linked, to, specific, societies, or, ceremonies, bambara, carvers, have, established, a, reputation, for, the, zoomorphic, headdresses, worn, by, tji, wara, society, members, although, they, are, all, different, they, all, display, a, highly, abstract, body, often, incorporating, a, zig, zag, motif, which, represents, the, sun, s, course, from, east, to, west, and, a, head, with, two, large, horns, bambara, members, of, the, tji, wara, society, wear, the,

posts, are, also, adorned, with, figures, and, symbols, there, are, nearly, eighty, styles, of, masks, but, their, basic, characteristic, is, great, boldness, in, the, use, of, geometric, shapes, independent, of, the, various, animals, they, are, supposed, to, represent, the, structure, of, a, large, number, of, masks, is, based, on, the, interplay, of, vertical, and, horizontal, lines, and,

these, ceremonies, is, considered, absolutely, necessary, in, the, case, of, the, dama, the, timing, types, of, masks, involved, and, other, ritual, elements, are, often, specific, to, one, or, two,

masqueraders, before, the, burial, of, a, male, dogon, dogon, masks, evoke, the, form, of, animals, associated, with, their, mythology, yet, their, significance, is, only, understood, by, the, highest, ranking, cult, members, whose, role, is, to, explain, the, meaning, of, each, mask, to, a, captivated, audience, burkina, faso, is, a, small, landlocked, country, north, of, ghana, and, south, of, mali, and, niger, economically, it, is, one, of, the, four, or, five, poorest, countries, in, the, world, culturally, it, is, extremely, rich, in, part, this, is, because, so, few, people, from, burkina, have, become, muslim, or, christian, many, of, the, ancient, artistic, traditions, for, which, africa, is, so, well, known, have, been, preserved, in, burkina, faso, because, so, many, people, continue, to, honor, the, ancestral, spirits, and, the, spirits, of, nature, in, great, part, they, honor, the, spirits, through, the, use, of, masks, and, carved, figures, many, of, the, countries, to, the, north, of, burkina, faso, had, become, predominantly, muslim, while, many, of, the, countries, to, the, south, of, burkina, faso, are, heavily, christian, in, contrast, many, of, the, people, of, burkina, faso, continue, to, offer, prayers, and, sacrifices, to, the, spirits, of, nature, and, to, the, spirits, of, their, ancestors, the, result, is, that, they, continue, to, use, the, sorts, of, art, that, we, see, in, museums, in, europe, and, america, one, of, the, principal, obstacles, to, understanding, the, art, of, burkina, faso, including, that, of, the, bwa, has, been, a, confusion, between, the, styles, of, the, bwa, gurunsi, and, mossi, and, a, confusion, of, the, bwa, people, with, their, neighbors, to, the, west, the, bobo, people, this, confusion, was, the, result, of, the, use, by, french, colonial, officers, of, jula, interpreters, at, the, turn, of, the, century, these, interpreters, considered, the, two, peoples, to, be, the, same, and, so, referred, to, the, bobo, as, bobo, fing, and, to, the, bwa, as, bobo, oule, in, fact, these, two, peoples, are, not, related, at, all, their, languages, are, quite, different, their, social, systems, are, quite, different, and, certainly, their, art, is, quite, different, in, terms, of, artistic, styles, the, confusion, stems, from, the, fact, that, the, bwa, gurunsi, and, mossi, make, masks, that, are, covered, with, red, white, and, black, geometric, graphic, patterns, this, is, simply, the, style, of, the, voltaic, or, gur, peoples, and, also, includes, the, dogon, and, other, peoples, who, speak, voltaic, languages, the, baoul, the, senoufo, and, the, dan, peoples, are, skilled, at, carving, wood, and, each, culture, produces, wooden, masks, in, wide, variety, the, ivorian, people, use, masks, to, represent, animals, in, caricature, to, depict, deities, or, to, represent, the, souls, of, the, departed, as, the, masks, are, held, to, be, of, great, spiritual, power, it, is, considered, a, taboo, for, anyone, other, than, specially, trained, persons, or, chosen, ones, to, wear, or, possess, certain, masks, these, ceremonial, masks, are, each, thought, to, have, a, soul, or, life, force, and, wearing, these, masks, is, thought, to, transform, the, wearer, into, the, entity, the, mask, represents, ivory, coast, c, te, d, ivoire, also, has, modern, painters, and, illustrators, gilbert, g, groud, criticizes, the, ancient, beliefs, in, black, magic, as, held, with, the, spiritual, masks, mentioned, above, in, his, illustrated, book, magie, noire, around, lake,

the, original, posts, no, longer, exist, these, more, recent, creations, are, thought, to, be, a, continuation, of, the, practice, the, kikuyu, people, also, continue, the, designs, of, ancient, tradition, in, the, designs, painted, on, their, shields, bantu, contemporary, kenyan, artists, include, elimo, njau, founder, of, the, paa, ya, paa, art, centre, a, nairobi, based, artists, workshop,

are, highly, innovative, both, in, style, use, of, color, and, execution, unlike, most, contemporary, kenyan, artist, they, paint, using, oils, acrylics, and, watercolors, and, or, combination, the, eskenazi, museum, of, art, at, indiana, university, has, a, large, collection, of, traditional, art, objects, from, kenya, including, jewelry, containers, weapons, walking, sticks, headrests, stools, utensils, and, other, objects, available, online, ethiopian, art, from, the, 4th, century, until, the, 20th, can, be, divided, into, two, broad, groupings, first, comes, a, distinctive, tradition, of, christian, art, mostly, for, churches, in, forms, including, painting, crosses, icons, illuminated, manuscripts, and, other, metalwork, such, as, crowns, secondly, there, are, popular, arts, and, crafts, such, as, textiles, basketry, and, jewellery, in, which, ethiopian, traditions, are, closer, to, those, of, other, peoples, in, the, region, its, history, goes, back, almost, three, thousand, years, to, the, kingdom, of, d, mt, the, ethiopian, orthodox, tewahedo, church, has, been, the, predominant, religion, in, ethiopia, for, over, 1500, years, for, most, of, this, period, in, a, very, close, relation, or, union, with, the, coptic, christianity, of, egypt, so, that, coptic, art, has, been, the, main, formative, influence, on, ethiopian, church, art, prehistoric, rock, art, comparable, to, that, of, other, african, sites, survives, in, a, number, of, places, and, until, the, arrival, of, christianity, stone, stelae, often, carved, with, simple, reliefs, were, erected, as, grave, markers, and, for, other, purposes, in, many, regions, tiya, is, one, important, site, the, pre, axumite, iron, age, culture, of, about, the, 5th, century, bce, to, the, 1st, century, ce, was, influenced, by, the, kingdom, of, kush, to, the, north, and, settlers, from, arabia, and, produced, cities, with, simple, temples, in, stone, such, as, the, ruined, one, at, yeha, which, is, impressive, for, its, date, in, the, 4th, or, 5th, century, bce, the, powerful, kingdom, of, aksum, emerged, in, the, 1st, century, bce, and, dominated, ethiopia, until, the, 10th, century, having, become, very, largely, christian, from, the, 4th, century, although, some, buildings, and, large, pre, christian, stelae, exist, there, appears, to, be, no, surviving, ethiopian, christian, art, from, the, axumite, period, however, the, earliest, works, remaining, show, a, clear, continuity, with, coptic, art, of, earlier, periods, there, was, considerable, destruction, of, churches, and, their, contents, in, the, 16th, century, when, the, country, was, invaded, by, muslim, neighbours, the, revival, of, art, after, this, was, influenced, by, catholic, european, art, in, both, iconography, and, elements, of, style, but, retained, its, ethiopian, character, in, the, 20th, century, western, artists, and, architects, began, to, be, commissioned, by, the, government, and, to, train, local, students, and, more, fully, westernized, art, was, produced, alongside, continuations, of, traditional, church, art, church, paintings, in, ethiopia, were, likely, produced, as, far, back, as, the, introduction, of, christianity, in, the, 4th, century, ad, although, the, earliest, surviving, examples, come, from, the, church, of, debre, selam, mikael, in, the, tigray, region, dated, to, the, 11th, century, ad, however, the, 7th, century, ad, followers, of, the, islamic, prophet, muhammad, who, fled, to, axum, in, temporary, exile, mentioned, that, the, original, church, of, our, lady, mary, of, zion, was, decorated, with, paintings, other, early, paintings, include, those, from, the, rock, hewn, churches, of, lalibela, dated, to, the, 12th, century, ad, and, in, nearby, geneta, maryam, dated, to, the, 13th, century, ad, however, paintings, in, illuminated, manuscripts, predate, the, earliest, surviving, church, paintings, for, instance, the, ethiopian, garima, gospels, of, the, 4th, 6th, centuries, ad, contain, illuminated, scenes, imitating, the, contemporary, byzantine, style, ethiopian, painting, on, walls, in, books, and, in, icons, is, highly, distinctive, though, the, style, and, iconography, are, closely, related, to, the, simplified, coptic, version, of, late, antique, and, byzantine, christian, art, from, the, 16th, century, roman, catholic, church, art, and, european, art, in, general, began, to, exert, some, influence, however, ethiopian, art, is, highly, conservative, and, retained, much, of, its, distinct, character, until, modern, times, the, production, of, illuminated, manuscripts, for, use, continued, up, to, the, present, day, another, important, form, of, ethiopian, art, also, related, to, coptic, styles, are, crosses, made, from, wood, and, metal, they, are, usually, copper, alloy, or, brass, plated, at, least, originally, with, gold, or, silver, the, heads, are, typically, flat, cast, plates, with, elaborate, and, complex, openwork, decoration, the, cross, motif, emerges, from, the, decoration, with, the, whole, design, often, forming, a, rotated, square, or, circular, shape, though, the, designs, are, highly, varied, and, inventive, many, incorporate, curved, motifs, rising, from, the, base, which, are, called, the, arms, of, adam, except, in, recent, western, influenced, examples, they, usually, have, no, corpus, or, figure, of, christ, and, the, design, often, incorporates, numerous, smaller, crosses, engraved, figurative, imagery, has, sometimes, been, added, crosses, are, mostly, either, processional, crosses, with, the, metal, head, mounted, on, a, long, wooden, staff, carried, in, religious, processions, and, during, the, liturgy, or, hand, crosses, with, a, shorter, metal, handle, in, the, same, casting, as, the, head, smaller, crosses, worn, as, jewellery, are, also, common, ethiopia, has, great, ethnic, and, linguistic, diversity, and, styles, in, secular, traditional, crafts, vary, greatly, in, different, parts, of, the, country, there, are, a, range, of, traditions, in, textiles, many, with, woven, geometric, decoration, although, many, types, are, also, usually, plain, ethiopian, church, practices, make, a, great, deal, of, use, of, colourful, textiles, and, the, more, elaborate, types, are, widely, used, as, church, vestments, and, as, hangings, curtains, and, wrappings, in, churches, although, they, have, now, largely, been, supplanted, by, western, fabrics, examples, of, both, types, can, be, seen, in, the, picture, at, the, top, of, the, article, icons,

tanzania, is, known, for, paintings, by, modern, artists, like, tinga, tinga, or, george, lilanga, and, for, traditional, as, well, as, modern, makonde, sculptures, like, in, other, regions, there, is, also, a, diversified, tradition, of, producing, textile, art, tinga, tinga, art, has, roots, in, decorating, hut, walls, in, central, and, south, tanzania, it, was, first, in, 1968, when, edward,
