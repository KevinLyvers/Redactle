the, birth, of, venus, italian, nascita, di, venere, is, a, painting, by, the, italian, artist, sandro, botticelli, probably, executed, in, the, mid, 1480s, it, depicts, the, goddess, venus, arriving, at, the, shore, after, her, birth, when, she, had, emerged, from, the, sea, fully, grown, called, venus, anadyomene, and, often, depicted, in, art, the, painting, is, in, the, uffizi, gallery, in, florence, italy, although, the, two, are, not, a, pair, the, painting, is, inevitably, discussed, with, botticelli, s, other, very, large, mythological, painting, the, primavera, also, in, the, uffizi, they, are, among, the, most, famous, paintings, in, the, world, and, icons, of, italian, renaissance, painting, of, the, two, the, birth, is, better, known, than, the, primavera, as, depictions, of, subjects, from, classical, mythology, on, a, very, large, scale, they, were, virtually, unprecedented, in, western, art, since, classical, antiquity, as, was, the, size, and, prominence, of, a, nude, female, figure, in, the, birth, it, used, to, be, thought, that, they, were, both, commissioned, by, the, same, member, of, the, medici, family, but, this, is, now, uncertain, they, have, been, endlessly, analysed, by, art, historians, with, the, main, themes, being, the, emulation, of, ancient, painters, and, the, context, of, wedding, celebrations, generally, agreed, the, influence, of, renaissance, neo, platonism, somewhat, controversial, and, the, identity, of, the, commissioners, not, agreed, most, art, historians, agree, however, that, the, birth, does, not, require, complex, analysis, to, decode, its, meaning, in, the, way, that, the, primavera, probably, does, while, there, are, subtleties, in, the, painting, its, main, meaning, is, a, straightforward, if, individual, treatment, of, a, traditional, scene, from, greek, mythology, and, its, appeal, is, sensory, and, very, accessible, hence, its, enormous, popularity, in, the, centre, the, goddess, venus, newly, born, in, fully, grown, state, in, accordance, with, tradition, stands, nude, in, a, giant, scallop, shell, the, size, of, the, shell, is, purely, imaginary, and, is, also, found, in, classical, depictions, of, the, subject, at, the, left, the, wind, god, zephyrus, blows, at, her, with, the, wind, shown, by, lines, radiating, from, his, mouth, he, is, in, the, air, and, carries, a, young, female, who, is, also, blowing, but, less, forcefully, both, have, wings, vasari, was, probably, correct, in, identifying, her, as, aura, personification, of, a, lighter, breeze, their, joint, efforts, are, blowing, venus, towards, the, shore, and, blowing, the, hair, and, clothes, of, the, other, figures, to, the, right, at, the, right, a, female, figure, who, may, be, floating, slightly, above, the, ground, holds, out, a, rich, cloak, or, dress, to, cover, venus, when, she, reaches, the, shore, as, she, is, about, to, do, she, is, one, of, the, three, horae, or, hours, greek, minor, goddesses, of, the, seasons, and, of, other, divisions, of, time, and, attendants, of, venus, the, floral, decoration, of, her, dress, suggests, she, is, the, hora, of, spring, she, stands, in, a, contrapposto, pose, similarly, to, venus, as, she, seems, relaxed, and, joyful, that, venus, has, arrived, alternative, identifications, for, the, two, secondary, female, figures, involve, those, also, found, in, the, primavera, the, nymph, held, by, zephyr, may, be, chloris, a, flower, nymph, he, married, in, some, versions, of, her, story, and, the, figure, on, land, may, be, flora, flora, is, generally, the, roman, equivalent, of, the, greek, chloris, in, the, primavera, chloris, is, transformed, into, the, figure, of, flora, next, to, her, following, ovid, s, fasti, but, it, is, hard, to, see, that, such, a, transformation, is, envisaged, here, however, the, roses, blown, along, with, the, two, flying, figures, would, be, appropriate, for, chloris, the, subject, is, not, strictly, the, birth, of, venus, a, title, given, to, the, painting, only, in, the, nineteenth, century, though, given, as, the, subject, by, vasari, but, the, next, scene, in, her, story, where, she, arrives, on, land, blown, by, the, wind, the, land, probably, represents, either, cythera, or, cyprus, both, mediterranean, islands, regarded, by, the, greeks, as, territories, of, venus, the, painting, is, large, but, slightly, smaller, than, the, primavera, and, where, that, is, a, panel, painting, this, is, on, the, cheaper, support, of, canvas, canvas, was, increasing, in, popularity, perhaps, especially, for, secular, paintings, for, country, villas, which, were, decorated, more, simply, cheaply, and, cheerfully, than, those, for, city, palazzi, being, designed, for, pleasure, more, than, ostentatious, entertainment, the, painting, is, on, two, pieces, of, canvas, sewn, together, before, starting, with, a, gesso, ground, tinted, blue, there, are, differences, to, botticelli, s, usual, technique, working, on, panel, supports, such, as, the, lack, of, a, green, first, layer, under, the, flesh, areas, there, are, a, number, of, pentimenti, revealed, by, modern, scientific, testing, the, hora, originally, had, low, classical, sandals, and, the, collar, on, the, mantle, she, holds, out, is, an, afterthought, the, hair, of, venus, and, the, flying, couple, was, changed, there, is, heavy, use, of, gold, as, a, pigment, for, highlights, on, hair, wings, textiles, the, shell, and, the, landscape, this, was, all, apparently, applied, after, the, painting, was, framed, it, was, finished, with, a, cool, gray, varnish, probably, using, egg, yolk, as, in, the, primavera, the, green, pigment, used, for, the, wings, of, zephyr, zephyr, s, companion, and, the, leaves, of, the, orange, trees, on, the, land, has, darkened, considerably, with, exposure, to, light, over, time, somewhat, distorting, the, intended, balance, of, colours, parts, of, some, leaves, at, the, top, right, corner, normally, covered, by, the, frame, have, been, less, affected, the, blues, of, the, sea, and, sky, have, also, lost, their, brightness, although, the, pose, of, venus, is, classical, in, some, respects, and, borrows, the, position, of, the, hands, from, the, venus, pudica, type, in, greco, roman, sculptures, see, section, below, the, overall, treatment, of, the, figure, standing, off, centre, with, a, curved, body, of, long, flowing, lines, is, in, many, respects, from, gothic, art, kenneth, clark, wrote, her, differences, from, antique, form, are, not, physiological, but, rhythmic, and, structural, her, whole, body, follows, the, curve, of, a, gothic, ivory, it, is, entirely, without, that, quality, so, much, prized, in, classical, art, known, as, aplomb, that, is, to, say, the, weight, of, the, body, is, not, distributed, evenly, either, side, of, a, central, plumb, line, she, is, not, standing, but, floating, her, shoulders, for, example, instead, of, forming, a, sort, of, architrave, to, her, torso, as, in, the, antique, nude, run, down, into, her, arms, in, the, same, unbroken, stream, of, movement, as, her, floating, hair, venus, body, is, anatomically, improbable, with, elongated, neck, and, torso, her, pose, is, impossible, although, she, stands, in, a, classical, contrapposto, stance, her, weight, is, shifted, too, far, over, the, left, leg, for, the, pose, to, be, held, the, proportions, and, poses, of, the, winds, to, the, left, do, not, quite, make, sense, and, none, of, the, figures, cast, shadows, the, painting, depicts, the, world, of, the, imagination, rather, than, being, very, concerned, with, realistic, depiction, ignoring, the, size, and, positioning, of, the, wings, and, limbs, of, the, flying, pair, on, the, left, which, bother, some, other, critics, kenneth, clark, calls, them, perhaps, the, most, beautiful, example, of, ecstatic, movement, in, the, whole, of, painting, the, suspension, of, our, reason, is, achieved, by, the, intricate, rhythms, of, the, drapery, which, sweep, and, flow, irresistibly, around, the, nude, figures, their, bodies, by, an, endless, intricacy, of, embrace, sustain, the, current, of, movement, which, finally, flickers, down, their, legs, and, is, dispersed, like, an, electric, charge, botticelli, s, art, was, never, fully, committed, to, naturalism, in, comparison, to, his, contemporary, domenico, ghirlandaio, botticelli, seldom, gave, weight, and, volume, to, his, figures, and, rarely, used, a, deep, perspectival, space, botticelli, never, painted, landscape, backgrounds, with, great, detail, or, realism, but, this, is, especially, the, case, here, the, laurel, trees, and, the, grass, below, them, are, green, with, gold, highlights, most, of, the, waves, regular, patterns, and, the, landscape, seems, out, of, scale, with, the, figures, the, clumps, of, bulrushes, in, the, left, foreground, are, out, of, place, here, as, they, come, from, a, freshwater, species, it, has, long, been, suggested, that, botticelli, was, commissioned, to, paint, the, work, by, the, medici, family, of, florence, perhaps, by, lorenzo, di, pierfrancesco, de, medici, 1463, 1503, a, major, patron, of, botticelli, under, the, influence, of, his, cousin, lorenzo, de, medici, il, magnifico, this, was, first, suggested, by, herbert, horne, in, his, monograph, of, 1908, the, first, major, modern, work, on, botticelli, and, long, followed, by, most, writers, but, more, recently, has, been, widely, doubted, though, it, is, still, accepted, by, some, various, interpretations, of, the, painting, rely, on, this, origin, for, its, meaning, although, relations, were, perhaps, always, rather, tense, between, the, magnifico, and, his, young, cousins, and, wards, lorenzo, di, pierfrancesco, and, his, brother, giovanni, di, pierfrancesco, de, medici, it, may, have, been, politic, to, commission, a, work, that, glorified, the, older, lorenzo, as, some, interpretations, have, it, there, may, be, a, deliberate, ambiguity, as, to, which, lorenzo, was, intended, to, be, evoked, in, later, years, hostility, between, the, two, branches, of, the, family, became, overt, horne, believed, that, the, painting, was, commissioned, soon, after, the, purchase, in, 1477, of, the, villa, di, castello, a, country, house, outside, florence, by, lorenzo, and, giovanni, to, decorate, their, new, house, which, they, were, rebuilding, this, was, the, year, after, their, father, died, at, the, age, of, 46, leaving, the, young, boys, wards, of, their, cousin, lorenzo, il, magnifico, of, the, senior, branch, of, the, medici, family, and, de, facto, ruler, of, florence, there, is, no, record, of, the, original, commission, and, the, painting, is, first, mentioned, by, vasari, who, saw, it, together, with, the, primavera, at, castello, some, time, before, the, first, edition, of, his, lives, in, 1550, probably, by, 1530, 40, in, 1550, vasari, was, himself, painting, in, the, villa, but, he, very, possibly, visited, it, before, that, but, in, 1975, it, emerged, that, unlike, the, primavera, the, birth, is, not, in, the, inventory, apparently, complete, made, in, 1499, of, the, works, of, art, belonging, to, lorenzo, di, pierfrancesco, s, branch, of, the, family, ronald, lightbown, concludes, that, it, only, came, to, be, owned, by, the, medici, after, that, the, inventory, was, only, published, in, 1975, and, made, many, previous, assumptions, invalid, horne, dated, the, work, at, some, point, after, the, purchase, of, the, villa, in, 1477, and, before, botticelli, s, departure, for, rome, to, join, the, painting, of, the, sistine, chapel, in, 1481, recent, scholars, prefer, a, date, of, around, 1484, 86, on, grounds, of, the, work, s, place, in, the, development, of, botticelli, s, style, the, primavera, is, now, usually, dated, earlier, after, botticelli, s, return, from, rome, in, 1482, and, perhaps, around, the, time, of, lorenzo, di, pierfrancesco, s, wedding, in, july, 1482, but, by, some, still, before, botticelli, s, departure, whenever, the, two, paintings, were, united, at, castello, they, have, remained, together, ever, since, they, stayed, in, castello, until, 1815, when, they, were, transferred, to, the, uffizi, for, some, years, until, 1919, they, were, kept, in, the, galleria, dell, accademia, another, government, museum, in, florence, although, there, are, ancient, and, modern, texts, that, are, relevant, no, single, text, provides, the, precise, imagery, of, the, painting, which, has, led, scholars, to, propose, many, sources, and, interpretations, many, art, historians, who, specialize, in, the, italian, renaissance, have, found, neoplatonic, interpretations, of, which, two, different, versions, have, been, articulated, by, edgar, wind, and, ernst, gombrich, to, be, the, key, to, understanding, the, painting, botticelli, represented, the, neoplatonic, idea, of, divine, love, in, the, form, of, a, nude, venus, for, plato, and, so, for, the, members, of, the, florentine, platonic, academy, venus, had, two, aspects, she, was, an, earthly, goddess, who, aroused, humans, to, physical, love, or, she, was, a, heavenly, goddess, who, inspired, intellectual, love, in, them, plato, further, argued, that, contemplation, of, physical, beauty, allowed, the, mind, to, better, understand, spiritual, beauty, so, looking, at, venus, the, most, beautiful, of, goddesses, might, at, first, raise, a, physical, response, in, viewers, which, then, lifted, their, minds, towards, the, godly, a, neoplatonic, reading, of, botticelli, s, birth, of, venus, suggests, that, 15th, century, viewers, would, have, looked, at, the, painting, and, felt, their, minds, lifted, to, the, realm, of, divine, love, the, composition, with, a, central, nude, figure, and, one, to, the, side, with, an, arm, raised, above, the, head, of, the, first, and, winged, beings, in, attendance, would, have, reminded, its, renaissance, viewers, of, the, traditional, iconography, of, the, baptism, of, christ, marking, the, start, of, his, ministry, on, earth, in, a, similar, way, the, scene, shows, here, marks, the, start, of, venus, s, ministry, of, love, whether, in, a, simple, sense, or, the, expanded, meaning, of, renaissance, neoplatonism, more, recently, questions, have, arisen, about, neoplatonism, as, the, dominant, intellectual, system, of, late, 15th, century, florence, and, scholars, have, indicated, that, there, might, be, other, ways, to, interpret, botticelli, s, mythological, paintings, in, particular, both, primavera, and, birth, of, venus, have, been, seen, as, wedding, paintings, that, suggest, appropriate, behaviors, for, brides, and, grooms, the, laurel, trees, at, right, and, laurel, wreath, worn, by, the, hora, are, punning, references, to, the, name, lorenzo, though, it, is, uncertain, whether, lorenzo, il, magnifico, the, effective, ruler, of, florence, or, his, young, cousin, lorenzo, di, pierfrancesco, is, meant, in, the, same, way, the, flowers, in, the, air, around, zephyr, and, on, the, textiles, worn, and, carried, by, the, hora, evoke, the, name, of, florence, the, closest, precedent, for, the, scene, is, generally, agreed, to, be, in, one, of, the, early, ancient, greek, homeric, hymns, published, in, florence, in, 1488, by, the, greek, refugee, demetrios, chalkokondyles, this, poem, was, probably, already, known, to, botticelli, s, florentine, contemporary, and, lorenzo, di, medici, s, court, poet, angelo, poliziano, the, iconography, of, the, birth, of, venus, is, similar, to, a, description, of, a, relief, of, the, event, in, poliziano, s, poem, the, stanze, per, la, giostra, commemorating, a, medici, joust, in, 1475, which, may, also, have, influenced, botticelli, although, there, are, many, differences, for, example, poliziano, talks, of, multiple, horae, and, zephyrs, older, writers, following, horne, posited, that, his, patron, lorenzo, di, pierfrancesco, asked, him, to, paint, a, subject, illustrating, the, lines, and, that, remains, a, possibility, though, one, difficult, to, maintain, so, confidently, today, another, poem, by, politian, speaks, of, zephyr, causing, flowers, to, bloom, and, spreading, their, scent, over, the, land, which, probably, explains, the, roses, he, blows, along, with, him, in, the, painting, having, a, large, standing, female, nude, as, the, central, focus, was, unprecedented, in, post, classical, western, painting, and, certainly, drew, on, the, classical, sculptures, which, were, coming, to, light, in, this, period, especially, in, rome, where, botticelli, had, spent, 1481, 82, working, on, the, walls, of, the, sistine, chapel, the, pose, of, botticelli, s, venus, follows, the, venus, pudica, venus, of, modesty, type, from, classical, antiquity, where, the, hands, are, held, to, cover, the, breasts, and, groin, in, classical, art, this, is, not, associated, with, the, new, born, venus, anadyomene, what, became, a, famous, example, of, this, type, is, the, venus, de, medici, a, marble, sculpture, that, was, in, a, medici, collection, in, rome, by, 1559, which, botticelli, may, have, had, opportunity, to, study, the, date, it, was, found, is, unclear, the, painter, and, the, humanist, scholars, who, probably, advised, him, would, have, recalled, that, pliny, the, elder, had, mentioned, a, lost, masterpiece, of, the, celebrated, ancient, greek, painter, apelles, representing, venus, anadyomene, venus, rising, from, the, sea, according, to, pliny, alexander, the, great, offered, his, mistress, campaspe, as, the, model, for, the, nude, venus, and, later, realizing, that, apelles, had, fallen, in, love, with, the, girl, gave, her, to, the, artist, in, a, gesture, of, extreme, magnanimity, pliny, went, on, to, note, that, apelles, painting, of, pankaspe, as, venus, was, later, dedicated, by, augustus, in, the, shrine, of, his, father, caesar, pliny, also, stated, that, the, lower, part, of, the, painting, was, damaged, and, it, was, impossible, to, find, anyone, who, could, restore, it, this, picture, decayed, from, age, and, rottenness, and, nero, substituted, for, it, another, painting, by, the, hand, of, dorotheus, pliny, also, noted, a, second, painting, by, apelles, of, venus, superior, even, to, his, earlier, one, that, had, been, begun, by, the, artist, but, left, unfinished, the, roman, images, in, various, media, showing, the, new, born, venus, in, a, giant, shell, may, well, be, crude, derivative, versions, of, these, paintings, botticelli, could, not, have, seen, the, frescos, unearthed, later, in, pompeii, but, may, well, have, seen, small, versions, of, the, motif, in, terracotta, or, engraved, gems, the, house, of, venus, in, pompeii, has, a, life, size, fresco, of, venus, lying, in, the, shell, also, seen, in, other, works, in, most, other, images, she, stands, with, her, hands, on, her, hair, wringing, the, water, from, it, with, or, without, a, shell, the, two, dimensionality, of, this, painting, may, be, a, deliberate, attempt, to, evoke, the, style, of, ancient, greek, vase, painting, or, frescos, on, the, walls, of, etruscan, tombs, the, only, types, of, ancient, painting, known, to, botticelli, another, interpretation, of, the, birth, of, venus, is, provided, by, art, historian, and, author, charles, r, mack, this, interpretation, takes, much, that, is, generally, agreed, but, mack, goes, on, to, explain, the, painting, as, an, allegory, extolling, the, virtues, of, lorenzo, de, medici, this, has, not, been, adopted, by, renaissance, art, historians, in, general, and, it, remains, problematic, since, it, depends, on, the, painting, being, commissioned, by, the, medici, yet, the, work, is, not, documented, in, medici, hands, until, well, into, the, following, century, mack, sees, the, scene, as, inspired, by, both, the, homeric, hymn, and, the, ancient, paintings, but, something, more, than, a, rediscovered, homeric, hymn, was, likely, in, the, mind, of, the, medici, family, member, who, commissioned, this, painting, from, botticelli, once, again, botticelli, in, his, version, of, the, birth, of, venus, might, be, seen, as, completing, the, task, begun, by, his, ancient, predecessor, apelles, even, surpassing, him, giving, added, support, to, this, interpretation, of, botticelli, as, a, born, again, apelles, is, the, fact, that, that, very, claim, was, voiced, in, 1488, by, ugolino, verino, in, a, poem, entitled, on, giving, praise, to, the, history, of, florence, while, botticelli, might, well, have, been, celebrated, as, a, revivified, apelles, his, birth, of, venus, also, testified, to, the, special, nature, of, florence, s, chief, citizen, lorenzo, de, medici, although, it, now, seems, that, the, painting, was, executed, for, another, member, of, the, medici, family, it, likely, was, intended, to, celebrate, and, flatter, its, head, lorenzo, de, medici, tradition, associates, the, image, of, venus, in, botticelli, s, painting, with, the, famous, beauty, simonetta, cattaneo, vespucci, of, whom, popular, legend, claims, both, lorenzo, and, his, younger, brother, giuliano, were, great, admirers, simonetta, was, possibly, born, in, the, ligurian, seaside, town, of, portovenere, the, port, of, venus, thus, in, botticelli, s, interpretation, pankaspe, the, ancient, living, prototype, of, simonetta, the, mistress, of, alexander, the, great, the, laurentian, predecessor, becomes, the, lovely, model, for, the, lost, venus, executed, by, the, famous, greek, painter, apelles, reborn, through, the, recreative, talents, of, botticelli, which, ended, up, in, rome, installed, by, emperor, augustus, in, the, temple, dedicated, to, florence, s, supposed, founder, julius, caesar, in, the, case, of, botticelli, s, birth, of, venus, the, suggested, references, to, lorenzo, supported, by, other, internal, indicators, such, as, the, stand, of, laurel, bushes, at, the, right, would, have, been, just, the, sort, of, thing, erudite, florentine, humanists, would, have, appreciated, accordingly, by, overt, implication, lorenzo, becomes, the, new, alexander, the, great, with, an, implied, link, to, both, augustus, the, first, roman, emperor, and, even, to, florence, s, legendary, founder, caesar, himself, lorenzo, furthermore, is, not, only, magnificent, but, as, was, alexander, in, pliny, s, story, also, magnanimous, as, well, ultimately, these, readings, of, the, birth, of, venus, flatter, not, only, the, medici, and, botticelli, but, all, of, florence, home, to, the, worthy, successors, to, some, of, the, greatest, figures, of, antiquity, both, in, governance, and, in, the, arts, these, essentially, pagan, readings, of, botticelli, s, birth, of, venus, should, not, exclude, a, more, purely, christian, one, which, may, be, derived, from, the, neoplatonic, reading, of, the, painting, indicated, above, viewed, from, a, religious, standpoint, the, nudity, of, venus, suggests, that, of, eve, before, the, fall, as, well, as, the, pure, love, of, paradise, once, landed, the, goddess, of, love, will, don, the, earthly, garb, of, mortal, sin, an, act, that, will, lead, to, the, new, eve, the, madonna, whose, purity, is, represented, by, the, nude, venus, once, draped, in, earthly, garments, she, becomes, a, personification, of, the, christian, church, which, offers, a, spiritual, transport, back, to, the, pure, love, of, eternal, salvation, in, this, case, the, scallop, shell, upon, which, this, image, of, venus, eve, madonna, church, stands, may, be, seen, in, its, traditionally, symbolic, pilgrimage, context, furthermore, the, broad, expanse, of, sea, serves, as, a, reminder, of, the, virgin, mary, s, title, stella, maris, alluding, both, to, the, madonna, s, name, maria, maris, and, to, the, heavenly, body, venus, stella, the, sea, brings, forth, venus, just, as, the, virgin, gives, birth, to, the, ultimate, symbol, of, love, christ, rather, than, choosing, one, of, the, many, interpretations, offered, for, botticelli, s, depiction, of, the, birth, arrival, of, venus, it, might, be, better, to, view, it, from, a, variety, of, perspectives, this, layered, approach, mythological, political, religious, was, intended, botticelli, or, more, likely, his, workshop, repeated, the, figure, of, venus, in, another, painting, of, about, 1490, this, life, sized, work, depicts, a, similar, figure, and, pose, partially, clad, in, a, light, blouse, and, contrasted, against, a, plain, dark, background, it, is, in, the, galleria, sabauda, in, turin, there, is, another, such, workshop, venus, in, berlin, and, very, likely, others, were, destroyed, in, the, bonfire, of, the, vanities, examples, seem, to, have, been, exported, to, france, and, germany, probably, influencing, lucas, cranach, the, elder, among, others, more, than, a, decade, later, botticelli, adapted, the, figure, of, venus, for, a, nude, personification, of, truth, in, his, calumny, of, apelles, here, one, hand, is, raised, pointing, to, heaven, for, justification, and, the, figure, s, gaze, also, looks, upwards, the, whole, effect, is, very, different
