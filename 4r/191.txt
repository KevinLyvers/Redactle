the, cathedral, itself, is, the, most, significant, aspect, of, the, novel, both, the, main, setting, and, the, focus, of, the, story, s, themes, the, building, had, fallen, into, disrepair, at, the, time, of, writing, which, was, something, hugo, felt, strongly, about, the, book, portrays, the, romantic, era, as, one, of, extremes, in, architecture, passion, and, religion, the, theme, of, determinism, fate, and, destiny, as, set, up, in, the, preface, of, the, novel, through, the, introduction, of, the, word, ananke, is, explored, as, well, as, revolution, and, social, strife, architecture, is, a, major, concern, of, hugo, s, in, notre, dame, de, paris, not, just, as, embodied, in, the, cathedral, itself, but, as, representing, throughout, paris, and, the, rest, of, europe, an, artistic, genre, which, hugo, argued, was, about, to, disappear, with, the, arrival, of, the, printing, press, claude, frollo, s, portentous, phrase, ceci, tuera, cela, this, will, kill, that, as, he, looks, from, a, printed, book, to, the, cathedral, building, sums, up, this, thesis, which, is, expounded, on, in, book, v, chapter, 2, hugo, writes, that, quiconque, naissant, po, te, se, faisait, architecte, whoever, was, born, a, poet, became, an, architect, arguing, that, while, the, written, word, was, heavily, censored, and, difficult, to, reproduce, architecture, was, extremely, prominent, and, enjoyed, considerable, freedom, il, existe, cette, poque, pour, la, pens, e, crite, en, pierre, un, privil, ge, tout, fait, comparable, notre, libert, actuelle, de, la, presse, c, est, la, libert, de, l, architecture, there, exists, in, this, era, for, thoughts, written, in, stone, a, privilege, comparable, to, our, current, freedom, of, the, press, it, is, the, freedom, of, architecture, with, the, recent, introduction, of, the, printing, press, it, became, possible, to, reproduce, one, s, ideas, much, more, easily, on, paper, and, hugo, considered, this, period, to, represent, the, last, flowering, of, architecture, as, a, great, art, form, as, with, many, of, his, books, hugo, was, interested, in, a, time, that, seemed, to, him, to, be, on, the, cusp, of, two, types, of, society, the, major, theme, of, the, third, book, is, that, over, time, the, cathedral, has, been, repaired, but, the, repairs, and, additions, have, made, the, cathedral, worse, and, who, put, the, cold, white, panes, in, the, place, of, those, windows, and, who, substituted, for, the, ancient, gothic, altar, splendidly, encumbered, with, shrines, and, reliquaries, that, heavy, marble, sarcophagus, with, angels, heads, and, clouds, are, a, few, examples, of, this, this, chapter, also, discusses, how, after, repairs, to, the, cathedral, after, the, french, revolution, there, was, not, a, significant, style, in, what, was, added, it, seems, as, if, the, new, architecture, is, now, uglier, and, worse, than, it, was, before, the, repair, hugo, introduced, with, this, work, the, concept, of, the, novel, as, epic, theatre, a, giant, epic, about, the, history, of, a, whole, people, incarnated, in, the, figure, of, the, great, cathedral, as, witness, and, silent, protagonist, of, that, history, and, the, whole, idea, of, time, and, life, as, an, ongoing, organic, panorama, centered, on, dozens, of, characters, caught, in, the, middle, of, that, history, it, is, the, first, novel, to, have, beggars, as, protagonists, a, significant, aspect, of, notre, dame, de, paris, is, that, it, encompasses, the, whole, of, life, from, the, king, of, france, to, paris, sewer, rats, in, a, manner, later, used, by, honor, de, balzac, gustave, flaubert, and, many, others, including, charles, dickens, the, enormous, popularity, of, the, book, in, france, spurred, the, nascent, historical, preservation, movement, in, that, country, and, strongly, encouraged, gothic, revival, architecture, ultimately, it, led, to, major, renovations, at, notre, dame, in, the, 19th, century, led, by, eug, ne, viollet, le, duc, much, of, the, cathedral, s, present, appearance, is, a, result, of, this, renovation, in, the, hunchback, of, notre, dame, victor, hugo, makes, frequent, reference, to, the, architecture, of, the, cathedral, of, notre, dame, in, paris, he, also, mentions, the, invention, of, the, printing, press, when, the, bookmaker, near, the, beginning, of, the, work, speaks, of, the, german, pest, in, 2010, british, archivist, adrian, glew, discovered, references, to, a, real, life, man, called, hunchback, who, was, a, foreman, of, a, government, sculpting, studio, in, paris, in, the, 1820s, who, worked, on, post, revolution, restorations, to, the, cathedral, the, name, quasimodo, has, become, synonymous, with, a, courageous, heart, beneath, a, grotesque, exterior, to, date, all, of, the, film, and, tv, adaptations, have, strayed, somewhat, from, the, original, plot, some, going, as, far, as, to, give, it, a, happy, ending, including, in, the, classic, 1939, film, and, the, 1996, disney, animated, film, the, 1956, french, film, is, one, of, the, few, versions, to, end, almost, exactly, like, the, novel, although, it, changes, other, sections, of, the, story, the, 1996, disney, version, has, an, ending, that, is, inspired, by, an, opera, created, by, hugo, himself, theatre, and, disability, as, well, as, the, authentic, portrayal, of, disability, by, disabled, actors, and, performers, has, grown, as, a, movement, and, portrayal, of, characters, like, these, quasimodo, is, subject, to, far, greater, scrutiny, and, criticism, as,
