music, theory, is, the, study, of, the, practices, and, possibilities, of, music, the, oxford, companion, to, music, describes, three, interrelated, uses, of, the, term, music, theory, the, first, is, the, rudiments, that, are, needed, to, understand, music, notation, key, signatures, time, signatures, and, rhythmic, notation, the, second, is, learning, scholars, views, on, music, from, antiquity, to, the, present, the, third, is, a, sub, topic, of, musicology, that, seeks, to, define, processes, and, general, principles, in, music, the, musicological, approach, to, theory, differs, from, music, analysis, in, that, it, takes, as, its, starting, point, not, the, individual, work, or, performance, but, the, fundamental, materials, from, which, it, is, built, music, theory, is, frequently, concerned, with, describing, how, musicians, and, composers, make, music, including, tuning, systems, and, composition, methods, among, other, topics, because, of, the, ever, expanding, conception, of, what, constitutes, music, a, more, inclusive, definition, could, be, the, consideration, of, any, sonic, phenomena, including, silence, this, is, not, an, absolute, guideline, however, for, example, the, study, of, music, in, the, quadrivium, liberal, arts, university, curriculum, that, was, common, in, medieval, europe, was, an, abstract, system, of, proportions, that, was, carefully, studied, at, a, distance, from, actual, musical, practice, but, this, medieval, discipline, became, the, basis, for, tuning, systems, in, later, centuries, and, is, generally, included, in, modern, scholarship, on, the, history, of, music, theory, music, theory, as, a, practical, discipline, encompasses, the, methods, and, concepts, that, composers, and, other, musicians, use, in, creating, and, performing, music, the, development, preservation, and, transmission, of, music, theory, in, this, sense, may, be, found, in, oral, and, written, music, making, traditions, musical, instruments, and, other, artifacts, for, example, ancient, instruments, from, prehistoric, sites, around, the, world, reveal, details, about, the, music, they, produced, and, potentially, something, of, the, musical, theory, that, might, have, been, used, by, their, makers, in, ancient, and, living, cultures, around, the, world, the, deep, and, long, roots, of, music, theory, are, visible, in, instruments, oral, traditions, and, current, music, making, many, cultures, have, also, considered, music, theory, in, more, formal, ways, such, as, written, treatises, and, music, notation, practical, and, scholarly, traditions, overlap, as, many, practical, treatises, about, music, place, themselves, within, a, tradition, of, other, treatises, which, are, cited, regularly, just, as, scholarly, writing, cites, earlier, research, in, modern, academia, music, theory, is, a, subfield, of, musicology, the, wider, study, of, musical, cultures, and, history, music, theory, is, often, concerned, with, abstract, musical, aspects, such, as, tuning, and, tonal, systems, scales, consonance, and, dissonance, and, rhythmic, relationships, in, addition, there, is, also, a, body, of, theory, concerning, practical, aspects, such, as, the, creation, or, the, performance, of, music, orchestration, ornamentation, improvisation, and, electronic, sound, production, a, person, who, researches, or, teaches, music, theory, is, a, music, theorist, university, study, typically, to, the, ma, or, phd, level, is, required, to, teach, as, a, tenure, track, music, theorist, in, a, us, or, canadian, university, methods, of, analysis, include, mathematics, graphic, analysis, and, especially, analysis, enabled, by, western, music, notation, comparative, descriptive, statistical, and, other, methods, are, also, used, music, theory, textbooks, especially, in, the, united, states, of, america, often, include, elements, of, musical, acoustics, considerations, of, musical, notation, and, techniques, of, tonal, composition, harmony, and, counterpoint, among, other, topics, several, surviving, sumerian, and, akkadian, clay, tablets, include, musical, information, of, a, theoretical, nature, mainly, lists, of, intervals, and, tunings, the, scholar, sam, mirelman, reports, that, the, earliest, of, these, texts, dates, from, before, 1500, bce, a, millennium, earlier, than, surviving, evidence, from, any, other, culture, of, comparable, musical, thought, further, all, the, mesopotamian, texts, are, united, by, the, use, of, a, terminology, for, music, that, according, to, the, approximate, dating, of, the, texts, was, in, use, for, over, 1, 000, years, much, of, chinese, music, history, and, theory, remains, unclear, chinese, theory, starts, from, numbers, the, main, musical, numbers, being, twelve, five, and, eight, twelve, refers, to, the, number, of, pitches, on, which, the, scales, can, be, constructed, the, l, shi, chunqiu, from, about, 238, bce, recalls, the, legend, of, ling, lun, on, order, of, the, yellow, emperor, ling, lun, collected, twelve, bamboo, lengths, with, thick, and, even, nodes, blowing, on, one, of, these, like, a, pipe, he, found, its, sound, agreeable, and, named, it, huangzhong, the, yellow, bell, he, then, heard, phoenixes, singing, the, male, and, female, phoenix, each, sang, six, tones, ling, lun, cut, his, bamboo, pipes, to, match, the, pitches, of, the, phoenixes, producing, twelve, pitch, pipes, in, two, sets, six, from, the, male, phoenix, and, six, from, the, female, these, were, called, the, l, l, or, later, the, shierl, apart, from, technical, and, structural, aspects, ancient, chinese, music, theory, also, discusses, topics, such, as, the, nature, and, functions, of, music, the, yueji, record, of, music, c1st, and, 2nd, centuries, bce, for, example, manifests, confucian, moral, theories, of, understanding, music, in, its, social, context, studied, and, implemented, by, confucian, scholar, officials, these, theories, helped, form, a, musical, confucianism, that, overshadowed, but, did, not, erase, rival, approaches, these, include, the, assertion, of, mozi, c, 468, c, 376, bce, that, music, wasted, human, and, material, resources, and, laozi, s, claim, that, the, greatest, music, had, no, sounds, even, the, music, of, the, qin, zither, a, genre, closely, affiliated, with, confucian, scholar, officials, includes, many, works, with, daoist, references, such, as, tianfeng, huanpei, heavenly, breeze, and, sounds, of, jade, pendants, the, samaveda, and, yajurveda, c, 1200, 1000, bce, are, among, the, earliest, testimonies, of, indian, music, but, properly, speaking, they, contain, no, theory, the, natya, shastra, written, between, 200, bce, to, 200, ce, discusses, intervals, rutis, scales, gr, mas, consonances, and, dissonances, classes, of, melodic, structure, m, rchan, s, modes, melodic, types, j, tis, instruments, etc, early, preserved, greek, writings, on, music, theory, include, two, types, of, works, several, names, of, theorists, are, known, before, these, works, including, pythagoras, c, 570, c, 495, bce, philolaus, c, 470, c, 385, bce, archytas, 428, 347, bce, and, others, works, of, the, first, type, technical, manuals, include, more, philosophical, treatises, of, the, second, type, include, the, pipa, instrument, carried, with, it, a, theory, of, musical, modes, that, subsequently, led, to, the, sui, and, tang, theory, of, 84, musical, modes, medieval, arabic, music, theorists, include, the, latin, treatise, de, institutione, musica, by, the, roman, philosopher, boethius, written, c, 500, translated, as, fundamentals, of, music, was, a, touchstone, for, other, writings, on, music, in, medieval, europe, boethius, represented, classical, authority, on, music, during, the, middle, ages, as, the, greek, writings, on, which, he, based, his, work, were, not, read, or, translated, by, later, europeans, until, the, 15th, century, this, treatise, carefully, maintains, distance, from, the, actual, practice, of, music, focusing, mostly, on, the, mathematical, proportions, involved, in, tuning, systems, and, on, the, moral, character, of, particular, modes, several, centuries, later, treatises, began, to, appear, which, dealt, with, the, actual, composition, of, pieces, of, music, in, the, plainchant, tradition, at, the, end, of, the, ninth, century, hucbald, worked, towards, more, precise, pitch, notation, for, the, neumes, used, to, record, plainchant, guido, d, arezzo, wrote, a, letter, to, michael, of, pomposa, in, 1028, entitled, epistola, de, ignoto, cantu, in, which, he, introduced, the, practice, of, using, syllables, to, describe, notes, and, intervals, this, was, the, source, of, the, hexachordal, solmization, that, was, to, be, used, until, the, end, of, the, middle, ages, guido, also, wrote, about, emotional, qualities, of, the, modes, the, phrase, structure, of, plainchant, the, temporal, meaning, of, the, neumes, etc, his, chapters, on, polyphony, come, closer, to, describing, and, illustrating, real, music, than, any, previous, account, in, the, western, tradition, during, the, thirteenth, century, a, new, rhythm, system, called, mensural, notation, grew, out, of, an, earlier, more, limited, method, of, notating, rhythms, in, terms, of, fixed, repetitive, patterns, the, so, called, rhythmic, modes, which, were, developed, in, france, around, 1200, an, early, form, of, mensural, notation, was, first, described, and, codified, in, the, treatise, ars, cantus, mensurabilis, the, art, of, measured, chant, by, franco, of, cologne, c, 1280, mensural, notation, used, different, note, shapes, to, specify, different, durations, allowing, scribes, to, capture, rhythms, which, varied, instead, of, repeating, the, same, fixed, pattern, it, is, a, proportional, notation, in, the, sense, that, each, note, value, is, equal, to, two, or, three, times, the, shorter, value, or, half, or, a, third, of, the, longer, value, this, same, notation, transformed, through, various, extensions, and, improvements, during, the, renaissance, forms, the, basis, for, rhythmic, notation, in, european, classical, music, today, d, erlanger, divulges, that, the, arabic, music, scale, is, derived, from, the, greek, music, scale, and, that, arabic, music, is, connected, to, certain, features, of, arabic, culture, such, as, astrology, music, is, composed, of, aural, phenomena, music, theory, considers, how, those, phenomena, apply, in, music, music, theory, considers, melody, rhythm, counterpoint, harmony, form, tonal, systems, scales, tuning, intervals, consonance, dissonance, durational, proportions, the, acoustics, of, pitch, systems, composition, performance, orchestration, ornamentation, improvisation, electronic, sound, production, etc, pitch, is, the, lowness, or, highness, of, a, tone, for, example, the, difference, between, middle, c, and, a, higher, c, the, frequency, of, the, sound, waves, producing, a, pitch, can, be, measured, precisely, but, the, perception, of, pitch, is, more, complex, because, single, notes, from, natural, sources, are, usually, a, complex, mix, of, many, frequencies, accordingly, theorists, often, describe, pitch, as, a, subjective, sensation, rather, than, an, objective, measurement, of, sound, specific, frequencies, are, often, assigned, letter, names, today, most, orchestras, assign, concert, a, the, a, above, middle, c, on, the, piano, to, the, frequency, of, 440, hz, this, assignment, is, somewhat, arbitrary, for, example, in, 1859, france, the, same, a, was, tuned, to, 435, hz, such, differences, can, have, a, noticeable, effect, on, the, timbre, of, instruments, and, other, phenomena, thus, in, historically, informed, performance, of, older, music, tuning, is, often, set, to, match, the, tuning, used, in, the, period, when, it, was, written, additionally, many, cultures, do, not, attempt, to, standardize, pitch, often, considering, that, it, should, be, allowed, to, vary, depending, on, genre, style, mood, etc, the, difference, in, pitch, between, two, notes, is, called, an, interval, the, most, basic, interval, is, the, unison, which, is, simply, two, notes, of, the, same, pitch, the, octave, interval, is, two, pitches, that, are, either, double, or, half, the, frequency, of, one, another, the, unique, characteristics, of, octaves, gave, rise, to, the, concept, of, pitch, class, pitches, of, the, same, letter, name, that, occur, in, different, octaves, may, be, grouped, into, a, single, class, by, ignoring, the, difference, in, octave, for, example, a, high, c, and, a, low, c, are, members, of, the, same, pitch, class, the, class, that, contains, all, c, s, musical, tuning, systems, or, temperaments, determine, the, precise, size, of, intervals, tuning, systems, vary, widely, within, and, between, world, cultures, in, western, culture, there, have, long, been, several, competing, tuning, systems, all, with, different, qualities, internationally, the, system, known, as, equal, temperament, is, most, commonly, used, today, because, it, is, considered, the, most, satisfactory, compromise, that, allows, instruments, of, fixed, tuning, e, g, the, piano, to, sound, acceptably, in, tune, in, all, keys, notes, can, be, arranged, in, a, variety, of, scales, and, modes, western, music, theory, generally, divides, the, octave, into, a, series, of, twelve, pitches, called, a, chromatic, scale, within, which, the, interval, between, adjacent, tones, is, called, a, semitone, or, half, step, selecting, tones, from, this, set, of, 12, and, arranging, them, in, patterns, of, semitones, and, whole, tones, creates, other, scales, the, most, commonly, encountered, scales, are, the, seven, toned, major, the, harmonic, minor, the, melodic, minor, and, the, natural, minor, other, examples, of, scales, are, the, octatonic, scale, and, the, pentatonic, or, five, tone, scale, which, is, common, in, folk, music, and, blues, non, western, cultures, often, use, scales, that, do, not, correspond, with, an, equally, divided, twelve, tone, division, of, the, octave, for, example, classical, ottoman, persian, indian, and, arabic, musical, systems, often, make, use, of, multiples, of, quarter, tones, half, the, size, of, a, semitone, as, the, name, indicates, for, instance, in, neutral, seconds, three, quarter, tones, or, neutral, thirds, seven, quarter, tones, they, do, not, normally, use, the, quarter, tone, itself, as, a, direct, interval, in, traditional, western, notation, the, scale, used, for, a, composition, is, usually, indicated, by, a, key, signature, at, the, beginning, to, designate, the, pitches, that, make, up, that, scale, as, the, music, progresses, the, pitches, used, may, change, and, introduce, a, different, scale, music, can, be, transposed, from, one, scale, to, another, for, various, purposes, often, to, accommodate, the, range, of, a, vocalist, such, transposition, raises, or, lowers, the, overall, pitch, range, but, preserves, the, intervallic, relationships, of, the, original, scale, for, example, transposition, from, the, key, of, c, major, to, d, major, raises, all, pitches, of, the, scale, of, c, major, equally, by, a, whole, tone, since, the, interval, relationships, remain, unchanged, transposition, may, be, unnoticed, by, a, listener, however, other, qualities, may, change, noticeably, because, transposition, changes, the, relationship, of, the, overall, pitch, range, compared, to, the, range, of, the, instruments, or, voices, that, perform, the, music, this, often, affects, the, music, s, overall, sound, as, well, as, having, technical, implications, for, the, performers, the, interrelationship, of, the, keys, most, commonly, used, in, western, tonal, music, is, conveniently, shown, by, the, circle, of, fifths, unique, key, signatures, are, also, sometimes, devised, for, a, particular, composition, during, the, baroque, period, emotional, associations, with, specific, keys, known, as, the, doctrine, of, the, affections, were, an, important, topic, in, music, theory, but, the, unique, tonal, colorings, of, keys, that, gave, rise, to, that, doctrine, were, largely, erased, with, the, adoption, of, equal, temperament, however, many, musicians, continue, to, feel, that, certain, keys, are, more, appropriate, to, certain, emotions, than, others, indian, classical, music, theory, continues, to, strongly, associate, keys, with, emotional, states, times, of, day, and, other, extra, musical, concepts, and, notably, does, not, employ, equal, temperament, consonance, and, dissonance, are, subjective, qualities, of, the, sonority, of, intervals, that, vary, widely, in, different, cultures, and, over, the, ages, consonance, or, concord, is, the, quality, of, an, interval, or, chord, that, seems, stable, and, complete, in, itself, dissonance, or, discord, is, the, opposite, in, that, it, feels, incomplete, and, wants, to, resolve, to, a, consonant, interval, dissonant, intervals, seem, to, clash, consonant, intervals, seem, to, sound, comfortable, together, commonly, perfect, fourths, fifths, and, octaves, and, all, major, and, minor, thirds, and, sixths, are, considered, consonant, all, others, are, dissonant, to, a, greater, or, lesser, degree, context, and, many, other, aspects, can, affect, apparent, dissonance, and, consonance, for, example, in, a, debussy, prelude, a, major, second, may, sound, stable, and, consonant, while, the, same, interval, may, sound, dissonant, in, a, bach, fugue, in, the, common, practice, era, the, perfect, fourth, is, considered, dissonant, when, not, supported, by, a, lower, third, or, fifth, since, the, early, 20th, century, arnold, schoenberg, s, concept, of, emancipated, dissonance, in, which, traditionally, dissonant, intervals, can, be, treated, as, higher, more, remote, consonances, has, become, more, widely, accepted, rhythm, is, produced, by, the, sequential, arrangement, of, sounds, and, silences, in, time, meter, measures, music, in, regular, pulse, groupings, called, measures, or, bars, the, time, signature, or, meter, signature, specifies, how, many, beats, are, in, a, measure, and, which, value, of, written, note, is, counted, or, felt, as, a, single, beat, through, increased, stress, or, variations, in, duration, or, articulation, particular, tones, may, be, accented, there, are, conventions, in, most, musical, traditions, for, regular, and, hierarchical, accentuation, of, beats, to, reinforce, a, given, meter, syncopated, rhythms, contradict, those, conventions, by, accenting, unexpected, parts, of, the, beat, playing, simultaneous, rhythms, in, more, than, one, time, signature, is, called, polyrhythm, in, recent, years, rhythm, and, meter, have, become, an, important, area, of, research, among, music, scholars, the, most, highly, cited, of, these, recent, scholars, are, maury, yeston, fred, lerdahl, and, ray, jackendoff, jonathan, kramer, and, justin, london, a, melody, is, a, group, of, musical, sounds, in, agreeable, succession, or, arrangement, because, melody, is, such, a, prominent, aspect, in, so, much, music, its, construction, and, other, qualities, are, a, primary, interest, of, music, theory, the, basic, elements, of, melody, are, pitch, duration, rhythm, and, tempo, the, tones, of, a, melody, are, usually, drawn, from, pitch, systems, such, as, scales, or, modes, melody, may, consist, to, increasing, degree, of, the, figure, motive, semi, phrase, antecedent, and, consequent, phrase, and, period, or, sentence, the, period, may, be, considered, the, complete, melody, however, some, examples, combine, two, periods, or, use, other, combinations, of, constituents, to, create, larger, form, melodies, a, chord, in, music, is, any, harmonic, set, of, three, or, more, notes, that, is, heard, as, if, sounding, simultaneously, pp, 67, 359, p, 63, these, need, not, actually, be, played, together, arpeggios, and, broken, chords, may, for, many, practical, and, theoretical, purposes, constitute, chords, chords, and, sequences, of, chords, are, frequently, used, in, modern, western, west, african, and, oceanian, music, whereas, they, are, absent, from, the, music, of, many, other, parts, of, the, world, p, 15, the, most, frequently, encountered, chords, are, triads, so, called, because, they, consist, of, three, distinct, notes, further, notes, may, be, added, to, give, seventh, chords, extended, chords, or, added, tone, chords, the, most, common, chords, are, the, major, and, minor, triads, and, then, the, augmented, and, diminished, triads, the, descriptions, major, minor, augmented, and, diminished, are, sometimes, referred, to, collectively, as, chordal, quality, chords, are, also, commonly, classed, by, their, root, note, so, for, instance, the, chord, c, major, may, be, described, as, a, triad, of, major, quality, built, on, the, note, c, chords, may, also, be, classified, by, inversion, the, order, in, which, the, notes, are, stacked, a, series, of, chords, is, called, a, chord, progression, although, any, chord, may, in, principle, be, followed, by, any, other, chord, certain, patterns, of, chords, have, been, accepted, as, establishing, key, in, common, practice, harmony, to, describe, this, chords, are, numbered, using, roman, numerals, upward, from, the, key, note, per, their, diatonic, function, common, ways, of, notating, or, representing, chords, in, western, music, other, than, conventional, staff, notation, include, roman, numerals, figured, bass, much, used, in, the, baroque, era, chord, letters, sometimes, used, in, modern, musicology, and, various, systems, of, chord, charts, typically, found, in, the, lead, sheets, used, in, popular, music, to, lay, out, the, sequence, of, chords, so, that, the, musician, may, play, accompaniment, chords, or, improvise, a, solo, in, music, harmony, is, the, use, of, simultaneous, pitches, tones, notes, or, chords, p, 15, the, study, of, harmony, involves, chords, and, their, construction, and, chord, progressions, and, the, principles, of, connection, that, govern, them, harmony, is, often, said, to, refer, to, the, vertical, aspect, of, music, as, distinguished, from, melodic, line, or, the, horizontal, aspect, counterpoint, which, refers, to, the, interweaving, of, melodic, lines, and, polyphony, which, refers, to, the, relationship, of, separate, independent, voices, is, thus, sometimes, distinguished, from, harmony, in, popular, and, jazz, harmony, chords, are, named, by, their, root, plus, various, terms, and, characters, indicating, their, qualities, for, example, a, lead, sheet, may, indicate, chords, such, as, c, major, d, minor, and, g, dominant, seventh, in, many, types, of, music, notably, baroque, romantic, modern, and, jazz, chords, are, often, augmented, with, tensions, a, tension, is, an, additional, chord, member, that, creates, a, relatively, dissonant, interval, in, relation, to, the, bass, it, is, part, of, a, chord, but, is, not, one, of, the, chord, tones, 1, 3, 5, 7, typically, in, the, classical, common, practice, period, a, dissonant, chord, chord, with, tension, resolves, to, a, consonant, chord, harmonization, usually, sounds, pleasant, to, the, ear, when, there, is, a, balance, between, the, consonant, and, dissonant, sounds, in, simple, words, that, occurs, when, there, is, a, balance, between, tense, and, relaxed, moments, timbre, sometimes, called, color, or, tone, color, is, the, principal, phenomenon, that, allows, us, to, distinguish, one, instrument, from, another, when, both, play, at, the, same, pitch, and, volume, a, quality, of, a, voice, or, instrument, often, described, in, terms, like, bright, dull, shrill, etc, it, is, of, considerable, interest, in, music, theory, especially, because, it, is, one, component, of, music, that, has, as, yet, no, standardized, nomenclature, it, has, been, called, the, psychoacoustician, s, multidimensional, waste, basket, category, for, everything, that, cannot, be, labeled, pitch, or, loudness, but, can, be, accurately, described, and, analyzed, by, fourier, analysis, and, other, methods, because, it, results, from, the, combination, of, all, sound, frequencies, attack, and, release, envelopes, and, other, qualities, that, a, tone, comprises, timbre, is, principally, determined, by, two, things, 1, the, relative, balance, of, overtones, produced, by, a, given, instrument, due, its, construction, e, g, shape, material, and, 2, the, envelope, of, the, sound, including, changes, in, the, overtone, structure, over, time, timbre, varies, widely, between, different, instruments, voices, and, to, lesser, degree, between, instruments, of, the, same, type, due, to, variations, in, their, construction, and, significantly, the, performer, s, technique, the, timbre, of, most, instruments, can, be, changed, by, employing, different, techniques, while, playing, for, example, the, timbre, of, a, trumpet, changes, when, a, mute, is, inserted, into, the, bell, the, player, changes, their, embouchure, or, volume, a, voice, can, change, its, timbre, by, the, way, the, performer, manipulates, their, vocal, apparatus, e, g, the, shape, of, the, vocal, cavity, or, mouth, musical, notation, frequently, specifies, alteration, in, timbre, by, changes, in, sounding, technique, volume, accent, and, other, means, these, are, indicated, variously, by, symbolic, and, verbal, instruction, for, example, the, word, dolce, sweetly, indicates, a, non, specific, but, commonly, understood, soft, and, sweet, timbre, sul, tasto, instructs, a, string, player, to, bow, near, or, over, the, fingerboard, to, produce, a, less, brilliant, sound, cuivre, instructs, a, brass, player, to, produce, a, forced, and, stridently, brassy, sound, accent, symbols, like, marcato, and, dynamic, indications, pp, can, also, indicate, changes, in, timbre, in, music, dynamics, normally, refers, to, variations, of, intensity, or, volume, as, may, be, measured, by, physicists, and, audio, engineers, in, decibels, or, phons, in, music, notation, however, dynamics, are, not, treated, as, absolute, values, but, as, relative, ones, because, they, are, usually, measured, subjectively, there, are, factors, besides, amplitude, that, affect, the, performance, or, perception, of, intensity, such, as, timbre, vibrato, and, articulation, the, conventional, indications, of, dynamics, are, abbreviations, for, italian, words, like, forte, f, for, loud, and, piano, p, for, soft, these, two, basic, notations, are, modified, by, indications, including, mezzo, piano, mp, for, moderately, soft, literally, half, soft, and, mezzo, forte, mf, for, moderately, loud, sforzando, or, sforzato, sfz, for, a, surging, or, pushed, attack, or, fortepiano, fp, for, a, loud, attack, with, a, sudden, decrease, to, a, soft, level, the, full, span, of, these, markings, usually, range, from, a, nearly, inaudible, pianissississimo, pppp, to, a, loud, as, possible, fortissississimo, ffff, greater, extremes, of, pppppp, and, fffff, and, nuances, such, as, p, or, pi, piano, are, sometimes, found, other, systems, of, indicating, volume, are, also, used, in, both, notation, and, analysis, db, decibels, numerical, scales, colored, or, different, sized, notes, words, in, languages, other, than, italian, and, symbols, such, as, those, for, progressively, increasing, volume, crescendo, or, decreasing, volume, diminuendo, or, decrescendo, often, called, hairpins, when, indicated, with, diverging, or, converging, lines, as, shown, in, the, graphic, above, articulation, is, the, way, the, performer, sounds, notes, for, example, staccato, is, the, shortening, of, duration, compared, to, the, written, note, value, legato, performs, the, notes, in, a, smoothly, joined, sequence, with, no, separation, articulation, is, often, described, rather, than, quantified, therefore, there, is, room, to, interpret, how, to, execute, precisely, each, articulation, for, example, staccato, is, often, referred, to, as, separated, or, detached, rather, than, having, a, defined, or, numbered, amount, by, which, to, reduce, the, notated, duration, violin, players, use, a, variety, of, techniques, to, perform, different, qualities, of, staccato, the, manner, in, which, a, performer, decides, to, execute, a, given, articulation, is, usually, based, on, the, context, of, the, piece, or, phrase, but, many, articulation, symbols, and, verbal, instructions, depend, on, the, instrument, and, musical, period, e, g, viol, wind, classical, baroque, etc, there, is, a, set, of, articulations, that, most, instruments, and, voices, perform, in, common, they, are, from, long, to, short, legato, smooth, connected, tenuto, pressed, or, played, to, full, notated, duration, marcato, accented, and, detached, staccato, separated, detached, martel, heavily, accented, or, hammered, many, of, these, can, be, combined, to, create, certain, in, between, articulations, for, example, portato, is, the, combination, of, tenuto, and, staccato, some, instruments, have, unique, methods, by, which, to, produce, sounds, such, as, spiccato, for, bowed, strings, where, the, bow, bounces, off, the, string, in, music, texture, is, how, the, melodic, rhythmic, and, harmonic, materials, are, combined, in, a, composition, thus, determining, the, overall, quality, of, the, sound, in, a, piece, texture, is, often, described, in, regard, to, the, density, or, thickness, and, range, or, width, between, lowest, and, highest, pitches, in, relative, terms, as, well, as, more, specifically, distinguished, according, to, the, number, of, voices, or, parts, and, the, relationship, between, these, voices, for, example, a, thick, texture, contains, many, layers, of, instruments, one, of, these, layers, could, be, a, string, section, or, another, brass, the, thickness, also, is, affected, by, the, number, and, the, richness, of, the, instruments, playing, the, piece, the, thickness, varies, from, light, to, thick, a, lightly, textured, piece, will, have, light, sparse, scoring, a, thickly, or, heavily, textured, piece, will, be, scored, for, many, instruments, a, piece, s, texture, may, be, affected, by, the, number, and, character, of, parts, playing, at, once, the, timbre, of, the, instruments, or, voices, playing, these, parts, and, the, harmony, tempo, and, rhythms, used, the, types, categorized, by, number, and, relationship, of, parts, are, analyzed, and, determined, through, the, labeling, of, primary, textural, elements, primary, melody, secondary, melody, parallel, supporting, melody, static, support, harmonic, support, rhythmic, support, and, harmonic, and, rhythmic, support, common, types, included, monophonic, texture, a, single, melodic, voice, such, as, a, piece, for, solo, soprano, or, solo, flute, biphonic, texture, two, melodic, voices, such, as, a, duo, for, bassoon, and, flute, in, which, the, bassoon, plays, a, drone, note, and, the, flute, plays, the, melody, polyphonic, texture, and, homophonic, texture, chords, accompanying, a, melody, the, term, musical, form, or, musical, architecture, refers, to, the, overall, structure, or, plan, of, a, piece, of, music, and, it, describes, the, layout, of, a, composition, as, divided, into, sections, in, the, tenth, edition, of, the, oxford, companion, to, music, percy, scholes, defines, musical, form, as, a, series, of, strategies, designed, to, find, a, successful, mean, between, the, opposite, extremes, of, unrelieved, repetition, and, unrelieved, alteration, according, to, richard, middleton, musical, form, is, the, shape, or, structure, of, the, work, he, describes, it, through, difference, the, distance, moved, from, a, repeat, the, latter, being, the, smallest, difference, difference, is, quantitative, and, qualitative, how, far, and, of, what, type, different, in, many, cases, form, depends, on, statement, and, restatement, unity, and, variety, and, contrast, and, connection, musical, expression, is, the, art, of, playing, or, singing, music, with, emotional, communication, the, elements, of, music, that, comprise, expression, include, dynamic, indications, such, as, forte, or, piano, phrasing, differing, qualities, of, timbre, and, articulation, color, intensity, energy, and, excitement, all, of, these, devices, can, be, incorporated, by, the, performer, a, performer, aims, to, elicit, responses, of, sympathetic, feeling, in, the, audience, and, to, excite, calm, or, otherwise, sway, the, audience, s, physical, and, emotional, responses, musical, expression, is, sometimes, thought, to, be, produced, by, a, combination, of, other, parameters, and, sometimes, described, as, a, transcendent, quality, that, is, more, than, the, sum, of, measurable, quantities, such, as, pitch, or, duration, expression, on, instruments, can, be, closely, related, to, the, role, of, the, breath, in, singing, and, the, voice, s, natural, ability, to, express, feelings, sentiment, and, deep, emotions, whether, these, can, somehow, be, categorized, is, perhaps, the, realm, of, academics, who, view, expression, as, an, element, of, musical, performance, that, embodies, a, consistently, recognizable, emotion, ideally, causing, a, sympathetic, emotional, response, in, its, listeners, the, emotional, content, of, musical, expression, is, distinct, from, the, emotional, content, of, specific, sounds, e, g, a, startlingly, loud, bang, and, of, learned, associations, e, g, a, national, anthem, but, can, rarely, be, completely, separated, from, its, context, the, components, of, musical, expression, continue, to, be, the, subject, of, extensive, and, unresolved, dispute, musical, notation, is, the, written, or, symbolized, representation, of, music, this, is, most, often, achieved, by, the, use, of, commonly, understood, graphic, symbols, and, written, verbal, instructions, and, their, abbreviations, there, are, many, systems, of, music, notation, from, different, cultures, and, different, ages, traditional, western, notation, evolved, during, the, middle, ages, and, remains, an, area, of, experimentation, and, innovation, in, the, 2000s, computer, file, formats, have, become, important, as, well, spoken, language, and, hand, signs, are, also, used, to, symbolically, represent, music, primarily, in, teaching, in, standard, western, music, notation, tones, are, represented, graphically, by, symbols, notes, placed, on, a, staff, or, staves, the, vertical, axis, corresponding, to, pitch, and, the, horizontal, axis, corresponding, to, time, note, head, shapes, stems, flags, ties, and, dots, are, used, to, indicate, duration, additional, symbols, indicate, keys, dynamics, accents, rests, etc, verbal, instructions, from, the, conductor, are, often, used, to, indicate, tempo, technique, and, other, aspects, in, western, music, a, range, of, different, music, notation, systems, are, used, in, western, classical, music, conductors, use, printed, scores, that, show, all, of, the, instruments, parts, and, orchestra, members, read, parts, with, their, musical, lines, written, out, in, popular, styles, of, music, much, less, of, the, music, may, be, notated, a, rock, band, may, go, into, a, recording, session, with, just, a, handwritten, chord, chart, indicating, the, song, s, chord, progression, using, chord, names, e, g, c, major, d, minor, g7, etc, all, of, the, chord, voicings, rhythms, and, accompaniment, figures, are, improvised, by, the, band, members, the, scholarly, study, of, music, theory, in, the, twentieth, century, has, a, number, of, different, subfields, each, of, which, takes, a, different, perspective, on, what, are, the, primary, phenomenon, of, interest, and, the, most, useful, methods, for, investigation, musical, analysis, is, the, attempt, to, answer, the, question, how, does, this, music, work, the, method, employed, to, answer, this, question, and, indeed, exactly, what, is, meant, by, the, question, differs, from, analyst, to, analyst, and, according, to, the, purpose, of, the, analysis, according, to, ian, bent, analysis, as, a, pursuit, in, its, own, right, came, to, be, established, only, in, the, late, 19th, century, its, emergence, as, an, approach, and, method, can, be, traced, back, to, the, 1750s, however, it, existed, as, a, scholarly, tool, albeit, an, auxiliary, one, from, the, middle, ages, onwards, adolf, bernhard, marx, was, influential, in, formalising, concepts, about, composition, and, music, understanding, towards, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, the, principle, of, analysis, has, been, variously, criticized, especially, by, composers, such, as, edgard, var, se, s, claim, that, to, explain, by, means, of, is, to, decompose, to, mutilate, the, spirit, of, a, work, schenkerian, analysis, is, a, method, of, musical, analysis, of, tonal, music, based, on, the, theories, of, heinrich, schenker, 1868, 1935, the, goal, of, a, schenkerian, analysis, is, to, interpret, the, underlying, structure, of, a, tonal, work, and, to, help, reading, the, score, according, to, that, structure, the, theory, s, basic, tenets, can, be, viewed, as, a, way, of, defining, tonality, in, music, a, schenkerian, analysis, of, a, passage, of, music, shows, hierarchical, relationships, among, its, pitches, and, draws, conclusions, about, the, structure, of, the, passage, from, this, hierarchy, the, analysis, makes, use, of, a, specialized, symbolic, form, of, musical, notation, that, schenker, devised, to, demonstrate, various, techniques, of, elaboration, the, most, fundamental, concept, of, schenker, s, theory, of, tonality, may, be, that, of, tonal, space, the, intervals, between, the, notes, of, the, tonic, triad, form, a, tonal, space, that, is, filled, with, passing, and, neighbour, notes, producing, new, triads, and, new, tonal, spaces, open, for, further, elaborations, until, the, surface, of, the, work, the, score, is, reached, although, schenker, himself, usually, presents, his, analyses, in, the, generative, direction, starting, from, the, fundamental, structure, ursatz, to, reach, the, score, the, practice, of, schenkerian, analysis, more, often, is, reductive, starting, from, the, score, and, showing, how, it, can, be, reduced, to, its, fundamental, structure, the, graph, of, the, ursatz, is, arrhythmic, as, is, a, strict, counterpoint, cantus, firmus, exercise, even, at, intermediate, levels, of, the, reduction, rhythmic, notation, open, and, closed, noteheads, beams, and, flags, shows, not, rhythm, but, the, hierarchical, relationships, between, the, pitch, events, schenkerian, analysis, is, subjective, there, is, no, mechanical, procedure, involved, and, the, analysis, reflects, the, musical, intuitions, of, the, analyst, the, analysis, represents, a, way, of, hearing, and, reading, a, piece, of, music, transformational, theory, is, a, branch, of, music, theory, developed, by, david, lewin, in, the, 1980s, and, formally, introduced, in, his, 1987, work, generalized, musical, intervals, and, transformations, the, theory, which, models, musical, transformations, as, elements, of, a, mathematical, group, can, be, used, to, analyze, both, tonal, and, atonal, music, the, goal, of, transformational, theory, is, to, change, the, focus, from, musical, objects, such, as, the, c, major, chord, or, g, major, chord, to, relations, between, objects, thus, instead, of, saying, that, a, c, major, chord, is, followed, by, g, major, a, transformational, theorist, might, say, that, the, first, chord, has, been, transformed, into, the, second, by, the, dominant, operation, symbolically, one, might, write, dominant, c, major, g, major, while, traditional, musical, set, theory, focuses, on, the, makeup, of, musical, objects, transformational, theory, focuses, on, the, intervals, or, types, of, musical, motion, that, can, occur, according, to, lewin, s, description, of, this, change, in, emphasis, attitude, does, not, ask, for, some, observed, measure, of, extension, between, reified, points, rather, it, asks, if, i, am, at, s, and, wish, to, get, to, t, what, characteristic, gesture, should, i, perform, in, order, to, arrive, there, music, psychology, or, the, psychology, of, music, may, be, regarded, as, a, branch, of, both, psychology, and, musicology, it, aims, to, explain, and, understand, musical, behavior, and, experience, including, the, processes, through, which, music, is, perceived, created, responded, to, and, incorporated, into, everyday, life, modern, music, psychology, is, primarily, empirical, its, knowledge, tends, to, advance, on, the, basis, of, interpretations, of, data, collected, by, systematic, observation, of, and, interaction, with, human, participants, music, psychology, is, a, field, of, research, with, practical, relevance, for, many, areas, including, music, performance, composition, education, criticism, and, therapy, as, well, as, investigations, of, human, aptitude, skill, intelligence, creativity, and, social, behavior, music, psychology, can, shed, light, on, non, psychological, aspects, of, musicology, and, musical, practice, for, example, it, contributes, to, music, theory, through, investigations, of, the, perception, and, computational, modelling, of, musical, structures, such, as, melody, harmony, tonality, rhythm, meter, and, form, research, in, music, history, can, benefit, from, systematic, study, of, the, history, of, musical, syntax, or, from, psychological, analyses, of, composers, and, compositions, in, relation, to, perceptual, affective, and, social, responses, to, their, music, a, music, genre, is, a, conventional, category, that, identifies, some, pieces, of, music, as, belonging, to, a, shared, tradition, or, set, of, conventions, it, is, to, be, distinguished, from, musical, form, and, musical, style, although, in, practice, these, terms, are, sometimes, used, interchangeably, music, can, be, divided, into, different, genres, in, many, different, ways, the, artistic, nature, of, music, means, that, these, classifications, are, often, subjective, and, controversial, and, some, genres, may, overlap, there, are, even, varying, academic, definitions, of, the, term, genre, itself, in, his, book, form, in, tonal, music, douglass, m, green, distinguishes, between, genre, and, form, he, lists, madrigal, motet, canzona, ricercar, and, dance, as, examples, of, genres, from, the, renaissance, period, to, further, clarify, the, meaning, of, genre, green, writes, beethoven, s, op, 61, and, mendelssohn, s, op, 64, are, identical, in, genre, both, are, violin, concertos, but, different, in, form, however, mozart, s, rondo, for, piano, k, 511, and, the, agnus, dei, from, his, mass, k, 317, are, quite, different, in, genre, but, happen, to, be, similar, in, form, some, like, peter, van, der, merwe, treat, the, terms, genre, and, style, as, the, same, saying, that, genre, should, be, defined, as, pieces, of, music, that, came, from, the, same, style, or, basic, musical, language, others, such, as, allan, f, moore, state, that, genre, and, style, are, two, separate, terms, and, that, secondary, characteristics, such, as, subject, matter, can, also, differentiate, between, genres, a, music, genre, or, subgenre, may, also, be, defined, by, the, musical, techniques, the, style, the, cultural, context, and, the, content, and, spirit, of, the, themes, geographical, origin, is, sometimes, used, to, identify, a, music, genre, though, a, single, geographical, category, will, often, include, a, wide, variety, of, subgenres, timothy, laurie, argues, that, since, the, early, 1980s, genre, has, graduated, from, being, a, subset, of, popular, music, studies, to, being, an, almost, ubiquitous, framework, for, constituting, and, evaluating, musical, research, objects, musical, technique, is, the, ability, of, instrumental, and, vocal, musicians, to, exert, optimal, control, of, their, instruments, or, vocal, cords, to, produce, precise, musical, effects, improving, technique, generally, entails, practicing, exercises, that, improve, muscular, sensitivity, and, agility, to, improve, technique, musicians, often, practice, fundamental, patterns, of, notes, such, as, the, natural, minor, major, and, chromatic, scales, minor, and, major, triads, dominant, and, diminished, sevenths, formula, patterns, and, arpeggios, for, example, triads, and, sevenths, teach, how, to, play, chords, with, accuracy, and, speed, scales, teach, how, to, move, quickly, and, gracefully, from, one, note, to, another, usually, by, step, arpeggios, teach, how, to, play, broken, chords, over, larger, intervals, many, of, these, components, of, music, are, found, in, compositions, for, example, a, scale, is, a, very, common, element, of, classical, and, romantic, era, compositions, heinrich, schenker, argued, that, musical, technique, s, most, striking, and, distinctive, characteristic, is, repetition, works, known, as, tudes, meaning, study, are, also, frequently, used, for, the, improvement, of, technique, music, theorists, sometimes, use, mathematics, to, understand, music, and, although, music, has, no, axiomatic, foundation, in, modern, mathematics, mathematics, is, the, basis, of, sound, and, sound, itself, in, its, musical, aspects, exhibits, a, remarkable, array, of, number, properties, simply, because, nature, itself, is, amazingly, mathematical, the, attempt, to, structure, and, communicate, new, ways, of, composing, and, hearing, music, has, led, to, musical, applications, of, set, theory, abstract, algebra, and, number, theory, some, composers, have, incorporated, the, golden, ratio, and, fibonacci, numbers, into, their, work, there, is, a, long, history, of, examining, the, relationships, between, music, and, mathematics, though, ancient, chinese, egyptians, and, mesopotamians, are, known, to, have, studied, the, mathematical, principles, of, sound, the, pythagoreans, in, particular, philolaus, and, archytas, of, ancient, greece, were, the, first, researchers, known, to, have, investigated, the, expression, of, musical, scales, in, terms, of, numerical, ratios, in, the, modern, era, musical, set, theory, uses, the, language, of, mathematical, set, theory, in, an, elementary, way, to, organize, musical, objects, and, describe, their, relationships, to, analyze, the, structure, of, a, piece, of, typically, atonal, music, using, musical, set, theory, one, usually, starts, with, a, set, of, tones, which, could, form, motives, or, chords, by, applying, simple, operations, such, as, transposition, and, inversion, one, can, discover, deep, structures, in, the, music, operations, such, as, transposition, and, inversion, are, called, isometries, because, they, preserve, the, intervals, between, tones, in, a, set, expanding, on, the, methods, of, musical, set, theory, some, theorists, have, used, abstract, algebra, to, analyze, music, for, example, the, pitch, classes, in, an, equally, tempered, octave, form, an, abelian, group, with, 12, elements, it, is, possible, to, describe, just, intonation, in, terms, of, a, free, abelian, group, in, music, theory, serialism, is, a, method, or, technique, of, composition, that, uses, a, series, of, values, to, manipulate, different, musical, elements, serialism, began, primarily, with, arnold, schoenberg, s, twelve, tone, technique, though, his, contemporaries, were, also, working, to, establish, serialism, as, one, example, of, post, tonal, thinking, twelve, tone, technique, orders, the, twelve, notes, of, the, chromatic, scale, forming, a, row, or, series, and, providing, a, unifying, basis, for, a, composition, s, melody, harmony, structural, progressions, and, variations, other, types, of, serialism, also, work, with, sets, collections, of, objects, but, not, necessarily, with, fixed, order, series, and, extend, the, technique, to, other, musical, dimensions, often, called, parameters, such, as, duration, dynamics, and, timbre, the, idea, of, serialism, is, also, applied, in, various, ways, in, the, visual, arts, design, and, architecture, integral, serialism, or, total, serialism, is, the, use, of, series, for, aspects, such, as, duration, dynamics, and, register, as, well, as, pitch, other, terms, used, especially, in, europe, to, distinguish, post, world, war, ii, serial, music, from, twelve, tone, music, and, its, american, extensions, are, general, serialism, and, multiple, serialism, musical, set, theory, provides, concepts, for, categorizing, musical, objects, and, describing, their, relationships, many, of, the, notions, were, first, elaborated, by, howard, hanson, 1960, in, connection, with, tonal, music, and, then, mostly, developed, in, connection, with, atonal, music, by, theorists, such, as, allen, forte, 1973, drawing, on, the, work, in, twelve, tone, theory, of, milton, babbitt, the, concepts, of, set, theory, are, very, general, and, can, be, applied, to, tonal, and, atonal, styles, in, any, equally, tempered, tuning, system, and, to, some, extent, more, generally, than, that, one, branch, of, musical, set, theory, deals, with, collections, sets, and, permutations, of, pitches, and, pitch, classes, pitch, class, set, theory, which, may, be, ordered, or, unordered, and, can, be, related, by, musical, operations, such, as, transposition, inversion, and, complementation, the, methods, of, musical, set, theory, are, sometimes, applied, to, the, analysis, of, rhythm, as, well, music, semiology, semiotics, is, the, study, of, signs, as, they, pertain, to, music, on, a, variety, of, levels, following, roman, jakobson, kofi, agawu, adopts, the, idea, of, musical, semiosis, being, introversive, or, extroversive, that, is, musical, signs, within, a, text, and, without, topics, or, various, musical, conventions, such, as, horn, calls, dance, forms, and, styles, have, been, treated, suggestively, by, agawu, among, others, the, notion, of, gesture, is, beginning, to, play, a, large, role, in, musico, semiotic, enquiry, writers, on, music, semiology, include, kofi, agawu, on, topical, theory, heinrich, schenker, robert, hatten, on, topic, gesture, raymond, monelle, on, topic, musical, meaning, jean, jacques, nattiez, on, introversive, taxonomic, analysis, and, ethnomusicological, applications, anthony, newcomb, on, narrativity, and, eero, tarasti, roland, barthes, himself, a, semiotician, and, skilled, amateur, pianist, wrote, about, music, in, image, music, text, the, responsibilities, of, form, and, eiffel, tower, though, he, did, not, consider, music, to, be, a, semiotic, system, signs, meanings, in, music, happen, essentially, through, the, connotations, of, sounds, and, through, the, social, construction, appropriation, and, amplification, of, certain, meanings, associated, with, these, connotations, the, work, of, philip, tagg, ten, little, tunes, fernando, the, flute, music, s, meanings, provides, one, of, the, most, complete, and, systematic, analysis, of, the, relation, between, musical, structures, and, connotations, in, western, and, especially, popular, television, and, film, music, the, work, of, leonard, b, meyer, in, style, and, music, theorizes, the, relationship, between, ideologies, and, musical, structures, and, the, phenomena, of, style, change, and, focuses, on, romanticism, as, a, case, study, music, theory, in, the, practical, sense, has, been, a, part, of, education, at, conservatories, and, music, schools, for, centuries, but, the, status, music, theory, currently, has, within, academic, institutions, is, relatively, recent, in, the, 1970s, few, universities, had, dedicated, music, theory, programs, many, music, theorists, had, been, trained, as, composers, or, historians, and, there, was, a, belief, among, theorists, that, the, teaching, of, music, theory, was, inadequate, and, that, the, subject, was, not, properly, recognised, as, a, scholarly, discipline, in, its, own, right, a, growing, number, of, scholars, began, promoting, the, idea, that, music, theory, should, be, taught, by, theorists, rather, than, composers, performers, or, music, historians, this, led, to, the, founding, of, the, society, for, music, theory, in, the, united, states, in, 1977, in, europe, the, french, soci, t, d, analyse, musicale, was, founded, in, 1985, it, called, the, first, european, conference, of, music, analysis, for, 1989, which, resulted, in, the, foundation, of, the, soci, t, belge, d, analyse, musicale, in, belgium, and, the, gruppo, analisi, e, teoria, musicale, in, italy, the, same, year, the, society, for, music, analysis, in, the, uk, in, 1991, the, vereniging, voor, muziektheorie, in, the, netherlands, in, 1999, and, the, gesellschaft, f, r, musiktheorie, in, germany, in, 2000, they, were, later, followed, by, the, russian, society, for, music, theory, in, 2013, the, polish, society, for, music, analysis, in, 2015, and, the, sociedad, de, an, lisis, y, teor, a, musical, in, spain, in, 2020, and, others, are, in, construction, these, societies, coordinate, the, publication, of, music, theory, scholarship, and, support, the, professional, development, of, music, theory, researchers, they, formed, in, 2018, a, network, of, european, societies, for, theory, and, or, analysis, of, music, the, eurot, am, as, part, of, their, initial, training, music, theorists, will, typically, complete, a, b, mus, or, a, b, a, in, music, or, a, related, field, and, in, many, cases, an, m, a, in, music, theory, some, individuals, apply, directly, from, a, bachelor, s, degree, to, a, phd, and, in, these, cases, they, may, not, receive, an, m, a, in, the,
