special, effects, often, abbreviated, as, f, x, or, simply, fx, are, illusions, or, visual, tricks, used, in, the, theatre, film, television, video, game, amusement, park, and, simulator, industries, to, simulate, the, imagined, events, in, a, story, or, virtual, world, it, is, sometimes, abbreviated, as, sfx, but, this, may, also, refer, to, sound, effects, special, effects, are, traditionally, divided, into, the, categories, of, mechanical, effects, and, optical, effects, with, the, emergence, of, digital, film, making, a, distinction, between, special, effects, and, visual, effects, has, grown, with, the, latter, referring, to, digital, post, production, and, optical, effects, while, special, effects, refers, to, mechanical, effects, mechanical, effects, also, called, practical, or, physical, effects, are, usually, accomplished, during, the, live, action, shooting, this, includes, the, use, of, mechanised, props, scenery, scale, models, animatronics, pyrotechnics, and, atmospheric, effects, creating, physical, wind, rain, fog, snow, clouds, making, a, car, appear, to, drive, by, itself, and, blowing, up, a, building, etc, mechanical, effects, are, also, often, incorporated, into, set, design, and, make, up, for, example, prosthetic, make, up, can, be, used, to, make, an, actor, look, like, a, non, human, creature, optical, effects, also, called, photographic, effects, are, the, techniques, in, which, images, or, film, frames, are, created, photographically, either, in, camera, using, multiple, exposure, mattes, or, the, sch, fftan, process, or, in, post, production, using, an, optical, printer, an, optical, effect, might, be, used, to, place, actors, or, sets, against, a, different, background, since, the, 1990s, computer, generated, imagery, cgi, has, come, to, the, forefront, of, special, effects, technologies, it, gives, filmmakers, greater, control, and, allows, many, effects, to, be, accomplished, more, safely, and, convincingly, and, as, technology, improves, at, lower, costs, as, a, result, many, optical, and, mechanical, effects, techniques, have, been, superseded, by, cgi, in, 1857, oscar, rejlander, created, the, world, s, first, special, effects, image, by, combining, different, sections, of, 32, negatives, into, a, single, image, making, a, montaged, combination, print, in, 1895, alfred, clark, created, what, is, commonly, accepted, as, the, first, ever, motion, picture, special, effect, while, filming, a, reenactment, of, the, beheading, of, mary, queen, of, scots, clark, instructed, an, actor, to, step, up, to, the, block, in, mary, s, costume, as, the, executioner, brought, the, axe, above, his, head, clark, stopped, the, camera, had, all, of, the, actors, freeze, and, had, the, person, playing, mary, step, off, the, set, he, placed, a, mary, dummy, in, the, actor, s, place, restarted, filming, and, allowed, the, executioner, to, bring, the, axe, down, severing, the, dummy, s, head, techniques, like, these, would, dominate, the, production, of, special, effects, for, a, century, it, wasn, t, only, the, first, use, of, trickery, in, cinema, it, was, also, the, first, type, of, photographic, trickery, that, was, only, possible, in, a, motion, picture, and, referred, to, as, the, stop, trick, georges, m, li, s, an, early, motion, picture, pioneer, accidentally, discovered, the, same, stop, trick, according, to, m, li, s, his, camera, jammed, while, filming, a, street, scene, in, paris, when, he, screened, the, film, he, found, that, the, stop, trick, had, caused, a, truck, to, turn, into, a, hearse, pedestrians, to, change, direction, and, men, to, turn, into, women, m, li, s, the, stage, manager, at, the, theatre, robert, houdin, was, inspired, to, develop, a, series, of, more, than, 500, short, films, between, 1896, and, 1914, in, the, process, developing, or, inventing, such, techniques, as, multiple, exposures, time, lapse, photography, dissolves, and, hand, painted, colour, because, of, his, ability, to, seemingly, manipulate, and, transform, reality, with, the, cinematograph, the, prolific, m, li, s, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, cinemagician, his, most, famous, film, le, voyage, dans, la, lune, 1902, a, whimsical, parody, of, jules, verne, s, from, the, earth, to, the, moon, featured, a, combination, of, live, action, and, animation, and, also, incorporated, extensive, miniature, and, matte, painting, work, from, 1910, to, 1920, the, main, innovations, in, special, effects, were, the, improvements, on, the, matte, shot, by, norman, dawn, with, the, original, matte, shot, pieces, of, cardboard, were, placed, to, block, the, exposure, of, the, film, which, would, be, exposed, later, dawn, combined, this, technique, with, the, glass, shot, rather, than, using, cardboard, to, block, certain, areas, of, the, film, exposure, dawn, simply, painted, certain, areas, black, to, prevent, any, light, from, exposing, the, film, from, the, partially, exposed, film, a, single, frame, is, then, projected, onto, an, easel, where, the, matte, is, then, drawn, by, creating, the, matte, from, an, image, directly, from, the, film, it, became, incredibly, easy, to, paint, an, image, with, proper, respect, to, scale, and, perspective, the, main, flaw, of, the, glass, shot, dawn, s, technique, became, the, textbook, for, matte, shots, due, to, the, natural, images, it, created, during, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, special, effects, techniques, were, improved, and, refined, by, the, motion, picture, industry, many, techniques, such, as, the, sch, fftan, process, were, modifications, of, illusions, from, the, theatre, such, as, pepper, s, ghost, and, still, photography, such, as, double, exposure, and, matte, compositing, rear, projection, was, a, refinement, of, the, use, of, painted, backgrounds, in, the, theatre, substituting, moving, pictures, to, create, moving, backgrounds, lifecasting, of, faces, was, imported, from, traditional, maskmaking, along, with, make, up, advances, fantastic, masks, could, be, created, which, fit, the, actor, perfectly, as, material, science, advanced, horror, film, maskmaking, followed, closely, many, studios, established, in, house, special, effects, departments, which, were, responsible, for, nearly, all, optical, and, mechanical, aspects, of, motion, picture, trickery, also, the, challenge, of, simulating, spectacle, in, motion, encouraged, the, development, of, the, use, of, miniatures, animation, creating, the, illusion, of, motion, was, accomplished, with, drawings, most, notably, by, winsor, mccay, in, gertie, the, dinosaur, and, with, three, dimensional, models, most, notably, by, willis, o, brien, in, the, lost, world, and, king, kong, naval, battles, could, be, depicted, with, models, in, studio, tanks, and, aeroplanes, could, be, flown, and, crashed, without, risk, of, life, and, limb, most, impressively, miniatures, and, matte, paintings, could, be, used, to, depict, worlds, that, never, existed, fritz, lang, s, film, metropolis, was, an, early, special, effects, spectacular, with, innovative, use, of, miniatures, matte, paintings, the, sch, fftan, process, and, complex, compositing, an, important, innovation, in, special, effects, photography, was, the, development, of, the, optical, printer, essentially, an, optical, printer, is, a, projector, aiming, into, a, camera, lens, and, it, was, developed, to, make, copies, of, films, for, distribution, until, linwood, g, dunn, refined, the, design, and, use, of, the, optical, printer, effects, shots, were, accomplished, as, in, camera, effects, dunn, demonstrating, that, it, could, be, used, to, combine, images, in, novel, ways, and, create, new, illusions, one, early, showcase, for, dunn, was, orson, welles, citizen, kane, where, such, locations, as, xanadu, and, some, of, gregg, toland, s, famous, deep, focus, shots, were, essentially, created, by, dunn, s, optical, printer, the, development, of, color, photography, required, greater, refinement, of, effects, techniques, color, enabled, the, development, of, such, travelling, matte, techniques, as, bluescreen, and, the, sodium, vapour, process, many, films, became, landmarks, in, special, effects, accomplishments, forbidden, planet, used, matte, paintings, animation, and, miniature, work, to, create, spectacular, alien, environments, in, the, ten, commandments, paramount, s, john, p, fulton, a, s, c, multiplied, the, crowds, of, extras, in, the, exodus, scenes, with, careful, compositing, depicted, the, massive, constructions, of, rameses, with, models, and, split, the, red, sea, in, a, still, impressive, combination, of, travelling, mattes, and, water, tanks, ray, harryhausen, extended, the, art, of, stop, motion, animation, with, his, special, techniques, of, compositing, to, create, spectacular, fantasy, adventures, such, as, jason, and, the, argonauts, whose, climax, a, sword, battle, with, seven, animated, skeletons, is, considered, a, landmark, in, special, effects, during, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, numerous, new, special, effects, were, developed, which, would, dramatically, increase, the, level, of, realism, achievable, in, science, fiction, films, sci, fi, special, effects, milestones, in, the, 1950s, included, the, godzilla, films, the, day, the, earth, stood, still, featuring, klaatu, and, 3, d, films, the, tokusatsu, genre, of, japanese, science, fiction, film, and, television, which, includes, the, kaiju, sub, genre, of, monster, films, rose, to, prominence, in, the, 1950s, the, special, effects, director, eiji, tsuburaya, and, the, director, ishir, honda, became, the, driving, forces, behind, the, original, godzilla, 1954, taking, inspiration, from, king, kong, 1933, tsuburaya, formulated, many, of, the, techniques, that, would, become, staples, of, the, tokusatsu, genre, such, as, so, called, suitmation, the, use, of, a, human, actor, in, a, costume, to, play, a, giant, monster, combined, with, the, use, of, miniatures, and, scaled, down, city, sets, godzilla, changed, the, landscape, of, japanese, cinema, science, fiction, and, fantasy, and, kickstarted, the, kaiju, genre, in, japan, called, the, monster, boom, which, remained, extremely, popular, for, several, decades, with, characters, such, as, the, aforementioned, godzilla, gamera, and, king, ghidorah, leading, the, market, tokusatsu, films, notably, warning, from, space, 1956, sparked, stanley, kubrick, s, interest, in, science, fiction, films, according, to, his, biographer, john, baxter, despite, their, clumsy, model, sequences, the, films, were, often, well, photographed, in, colour, and, their, dismal, dialogue, was, delivered, in, well, designed, and, well, lit, sets, in, 1968, stanley, kubrick, assembled, his, own, effects, team, douglas, trumbull, tom, howard, con, pederson, and, wally, veevers, rather, than, use, an, in, house, effects, unit, for, 2001, a, space, odyssey, in, this, film, the, spaceship, miniatures, were, highly, detailed, and, carefully, photographed, for, a, realistic, depth, of, field, the, shots, of, spaceships, were, combined, through, hand, drawn, rotoscoping, and, careful, motion, control, work, ensuring, that, the, elements, were, precisely, combined, in, the, camera, a, surprising, throwback, to, the, silent, era, but, with, spectacular, results, backgrounds, of, the, african, vistas, in, the, dawn, of, man, sequence, were, combined, with, soundstage, photography, via, the, then, new, front, projection, technique, scenes, set, in, zero, gravity, environments, were, staged, with, hidden, wires, mirror, shots, and, large, scale, rotating, sets, the, finale, a, voyage, through, hallucinogenic, scenery, was, created, by, douglas, trumbull, using, a, new, technique, termed, slit, scan, the, 1970s, provided, two, profound, changes, in, the, special, effects, trade, the, first, was, economic, during, the, industry, s, recession, in, the, late, 1960s, and, early, 1970s, many, studios, closed, down, their, in, house, effects, houses, technicians, became, freelancers, or, founded, their, own, effects, companies, sometimes, specialising, on, particular, techniques, opticals, animation, etc, the, second, was, precipitated, by, the, blockbuster, success, of, two, science, fiction, and, fantasy, films, in, 1977, george, lucas, s, star, wars, ushered, in, an, era, of, science, fiction, films, with, expensive, and, impressive, special, effects, effects, supervisor, john, dykstra, a, s, c, and, crew, developed, many, improvements, in, existing, effects, technology, they, created, a, computer, controlled, camera, rig, called, the, dykstraflex, that, allowed, precise, repetition, of, camera, motion, greatly, facilitating, travelling, matte, compositing, degradation, of, film, images, during, compositing, was, minimised, by, other, innovations, the, dykstraflex, used, vistavision, cameras, that, photographed, widescreen, images, horizontally, along, stock, using, far, more, of, the, film, per, frame, and, thinner, emulsion, filmstocks, were, used, in, the, compositing, process, the, effects, crew, assembled, by, lucas, was, dubbed, industrial, light, magic, and, since, 1977, has, spearheaded, many, effects, innovations, that, same, year, steven, spielberg, s, film, close, encounters, of, the, third, kind, boasted, a, finale, with, impressive, special, effects, by, 2001, veteran, douglas, trumbull, in, addition, to, developing, his, own, motion, control, system, trumbull, also, developed, techniques, for, creating, intentional, lens, flare, the, shapes, created, by, light, reflecting, in, camera, lenses, to, provide, the, film, s, undefinable, shapes, of, flying, saucers, the, success, of, these, films, and, others, since, has, prompted, massive, studio, investment, in, effects, heavy, science, fiction, films, this, has, fuelled, the, establishment, of, many, independent, effects, houses, a, tremendous, degree, of, refinement, of, existing, techniques, and, the, development, of, new, techniques, such, as, computer, generated, imagery, cgi, it, has, also, encouraged, within, the, industry, a, greater, distinction, between, special, effects, and, visual, effects, the, latter, is, used, to, characterise, post, production, and, optical, work, while, special, effects, refers, more, often, to, on, set, and, mechanical, effects, the, use, of, computer, animation, in, film, dates, back, to, the, early, 1980s, with, the, films, tron, 1982, and, golgo, 13, the, professional, 1983, since, the, 1990s, a, profound, innovation, in, special, effects, has, been, the, development, of, computer, generated, imagery, cgi, which, has, changed, nearly, every, aspect, of, motion, picture, special, effects, digital, compositing, allows, far, more, control, and, creative, freedom, than, optical, compositing, and, does, not, degrade, the, image, as, with, analogue, optical, processes, digital, imagery, has, enabled, technicians, to, create, detailed, models, matte, paintings, and, even, fully, realised, characters, with, the, malleability, of, computer, software, arguably, the, biggest, and, most, spectacular, use, of, cgi, is, in, the, creation, of, photo, realistic, images, of, science, fiction, fantasy, characters, settings, and, objects, images, can, be, created, in, a, computer, using, the, techniques, of, animated, cartoons, and, model, animation, the, last, starfighter, 1984, used, computer, generated, spaceships, instead, of, physical, scale, models, in, 1993, stop, motion, animators, working, on, the, realistic, dinosaurs, of, steven, spielberg, s, jurassic, park, were, retrained, in, the, use, of, computer, input, devices, by, 1995, films, such, as, toy, story, underscored, the, fact, that, the, distinction, between, live, action, films, and, animated, films, was, no, longer, clear, other, landmark, examples, include, a, character, made, up, of, broken, pieces, of, a, stained, glass, window, in, young, sherlock, holmes, a, shape, shifting, character, in, willow, a, tentacle, formed, from, water, in, the, abyss, the, t, 1000, terminator, in, terminator, 2, judgment, day, hordes, and, armies, of, robots, and, fantastic, creatures, in, the, star, wars, prequel, and, the, lord, of, the, rings, trilogies, and, the, planet, pandora, in, avatar, although, most, visual, effects, work, is, completed, during, post, production, it, must, be, carefully, planned, and, choreographed, in, pre, production, and, production, a, visual, effects, supervisor, is, usually, involved, with, the, production, from, an, early, stage, to, work, closely, with, the, director, and, all, related, personnel, to, achieve, the, desired, effects, practical, effects, also, require, significant, pre, planning, and, co, ordination, with, performers, and, production, teams, the, live, nature, of, the, effects, can, result, in, situations, where, resetting, due, to, an, error, mistake, or, safety, concern, incurs, significant, expense, or, is, impossible, due, to, the, destructive, nature, of, the, effect, live, special, effects, are, effects, that, are, used, in, front, of, a, live, audience, such, as, in, theatre, sporting, generation, genre, concerts, and, corporate, shows, types, of, effects, that, are, commonly, used, include, flying, effects, laser, lighting, theatrical, smoke, and, fog, co, 2, effects, and, pyrotechnics, other, atmospheric, effects, can, include, flame, confetti, bubbles, and, snow, one, notable, example, of, live, special, effects, in, theatre, production, is, in, the, bregenz, festival, with, its, use, of, a, large, intricate, stage, that, moves, to, supplement, what, s, being, acted, on, stage, mechanical, effects, encompass, the, use, of, mechanical, engineering, to, a, greater, degree, cars, being, flipped, and, hauled, over, buildings, are, usually, an, effect, built, on, specialised, rigs, and, gimbals, usually, a, team, of, engineers, or, freelance, film, companies, provide, these, effects, to, producers, camera, workers, stunt, artists, or, doubles, directors, and, engineers, collaborate, to, produce, the, proper, effect, as, the, action, is, recorded, against, a, green, screen, it, is, then, edited, and, reviewed, before, final, release, to, the, public
