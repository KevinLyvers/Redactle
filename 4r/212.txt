exchange, rate, with, as, many, as, 200, 000, english, speaking, expatriates, living, there, the, paris, tribune, reported, in, 1925, that, paris, had, an, american, hospital, an, american, library, and, an, american, chamber, of, commerce, many, american, writers, were, disenchanted, with, the, us, where, they, found, less, artistic, freedom, than, in, europe, for, example, hemingway, was, in, paris, during, the, period, when, ulysses, written, by, his, friend, james, joyce, was, banned, and, burned, in, new, york, the, themes, of, the, sun, also, rises, appear, in, its, two, epigraphs, the, first, is, an, allusion, to, the, lost, generation, a, term, coined, by, gertrude, stein, referring, to, the, post, war, generation, the, other, epigraph, is, a, long, quotation, from, ecclesiastes, one, generation, passeth, away, and, another, generation, cometh, but, the, earth, abideth, for, ever, the, sun, also, ariseth, and, the, sun, goeth, down, and, hasteth, to, his, place, where, he, arose, hemingway, told, his, editor, max, perkins, that, the, book, was, not, so, much, about, a, generation, being, lost, but, that, the, earth, abideth, forever, he, thought, the, characters, in, the, sun, also, rises, may, have, been, battered, but, were, not, lost, hemingway, scholar, wagner, martin, writes, that, hemingway, wanted, the, book, to, be, about, morality, which, he, emphasized, by, changing, the, working, title, from, fiesta, to, the, sun, also, rises, wagner, martin, argues, that, the, book, can, be, read, either, as, a, novel, about, bored, expatriates, or, as, a, morality, tale, about, a, protagonist, who, searches, for, integrity, in, an, immoral, world, months, before, hemingway, left, for, pamplona, the, press, was, depicting, the, parisian, latin, quarter, where, he, lived, as, decadent, and, depraved, he, began, writing, the, story, of, a, matador, corrupted, by, the, influence, of, the, latin, quarter, crowd, he, expanded, it, into, a, novel, about, jake, barnes, at, risk, of, being, corrupted, by, wealthy, and, inauthentic, expatriates, the, characters, form, a, group, sharing, similar, norms, and, each, greatly, affected, by, the, war, hemingway, captures, the, angst, of, the, age, and, transcends, the, love, story, of, brett, and, jake, although, they, are, representative, of, the, period, brett, is, starved, for, reassurance, and, love, and, jake, is, sexually, maimed, his, wound, symbolizes, the, disability, of, the, age, the, disillusion, and, the, frustrations, felt, by, an, entire, generation, hemingway, thought, he, lost, touch, with, american, values, while, living, in, paris, but, his, biographer, michael, s, reynolds, claims, the, opposite, seeing, evidence, of, the, author, s, midwestern, american, values, in, the, novel, hemingway, admired, hard, work, he, portrayed, the, matadors, and, the, prostitutes, who, work, for, a, living, in, a, positive, manner, but, brett, who, prostitutes, herself, is, emblematic, of, the, rotten, crowd, living, on, inherited, money, it, is, jake, the, working, journalist, who, pays, the, bills, again, and, again, when, those, who, can, pay, do, not, hemingway, shows, through, jake, s, actions, his, disapproval, of, the, people, who, did, not, pay, up, reynolds, says, that, hemingway, shows, the, tragedy, not, so, much, of, the, decadence, of, the, montparnasse, crowd, but, of, the, decline, in, american, values, of, the, period, as, such, the, author, created, an, american, hero, who, is, impotent, and, powerless, jake, becomes, the, moral, center, of, the, story, he, never, considers, himself, part, of, the, expatriate, crowd, because, he, is, a, working, man, to, jake, a, working, man, is, genuine, and, authentic, and, those, who, do, not, work, for, a, living, spend, their, lives, posing, the, twice, divorced, brett, ashley, represented, the, liberated, new, woman, in, the, 1920s, divorces, were, common, and, easy, to, be, had, in, paris, james, nagel, writes, that, in, brett, hemingway, created, one, of, the, more, fascinating, women, in, 20th, century, american, literature, sexually, promiscuous, she, is, a, denizen, of, parisian, nightlife, and, caf, s, in, pamplona, she, sparks, chaos, the, men, drink, too, much, and, fight, over, her, she, also, seduces, the, young, bullfighter, romero, and, becomes, a, circe, in, the, festival, critics, describe, her, variously, as, complicated, elusive, and, enigmatic, donald, daiker, writes, that, hemingway, treats, her, with, a, delicate, balance, of, sympathy, and, antipathy, she, is, vulnerable, forgiving, independent, qualities, that, hemingway, juxtaposes, with, the, other, women, in, the, book, who, are, either, prostitutes, or, overbearing, nags, nagel, considers, the, novel, a, tragedy, jake, and, brett, have, a, relationship, that, becomes, destructive, because, their, love, cannot, be, consummated, conflict, over, brett, destroys, jake, s, friendship, with, robert, cohn, and, her, behavior, in, pamplona, affects, jake, s, hard, won, reputation, among, the, spaniards, meyers, sees, brett, as, a, woman, who, wants, sex, without, love, while, jake, can, only, give, her, love, without, sex, although, brett, sleeps, with, many, men, it, is, jake, she, loves, dana, fore, writes, that, brett, is, willing, to, be, with, jake, in, spite, of, his, disability, in, a, non, traditional, erotic, relationship, other, critics, such, as, leslie, fiedler, and, nina, baym, see, her, as, a, supreme, bitch, fiedler, sees, brett, as, one, of, the, outstanding, examples, of, hemingway, s, bitch, women, jake, becomes, bitter, about, their, relationship, as, when, he, says, send, a, girl, off, with, a, man, now, go, and, bring, her, back, and, sign, the, wire, with, love, critics, interpret, the, jake, brett, relationship, in, various, ways, daiker, suggests, that, brett, s, behavior, in, madrid, after, romero, leaves, and, when, jake, arrives, at, her, summons, reflects, her, immorality, scott, donaldson, thinks, hemingway, presents, the, jake, brett, relationship, in, such, a, manner, that, jake, knew, that, in, having, brett, for, a, friend, he, had, been, getting, something, for, nothing, and, that, sooner, or, later, he, would, have, to, pay, the, bill, daiker, notes, that, brett, relies, on, jake, to, pay, for, her, train, fare, from, madrid, to, san, sebasti, n, where, she, rejoins, her, fianc, mike, in, a, piece, hemingway, cut, he, has, jake, thinking, you, learned, a, lot, about, a, woman, by, not, sleeping, with, her, by, the, end, of, the, novel, although, jake, loves, brett, he, appears, to, undergo, a, transformation, in, madrid, when, he, begins, to, distance, himself, from, her, reynolds, believes, that, jake, represents, the, everyman, and, that, in, the, course, of, the, narrative, he, loses, his, honor, faith, and, hope, he, sees, the, novel, as, a, morality, play, with, jake, as, the, person, who, loses, the, most, in, the, sun, also, rises, hemingway, contrasts, paris, with, pamplona, and, the, frenzy, of, the, fiesta, with, the, tranquillity, of, the, spanish, countryside, spain, was, among, hemingway, s, favorite, european, countries, he, considered, it, a, healthy, place, and, the, only, country, that, hasn, t, been, shot, to, pieces, he, was, profoundly, affected, by, the, spectacle, of, bullfighting, writing, it, isn, t, just, brutal, like, they, always, told, us, it, s, a, great, tragedy, and, the, most, beautiful, thing, i, ve, ever, seen, and, takes, more, guts, and, skill, and, guts, again, than, anything, possibly, could, it, s, just, like, having, a, ringside, seat, at, the, war, with, nothing, going, to, happen, to, you, he, demonstrated, what, he, considered, the, purity, in, the, culture, of, bullfighting, called, afici, n, and, presented, it, as, an, authentic, way, of, life, contrasted, against, the, inauthenticity, of, the, parisian, bohemians, to, be, accepted, as, an, aficionado, was, rare, for, a, non, spaniard, jake, goes, through, a, difficult, process, to, gain, acceptance, by, the, fellowship, of, afici, n, allen, josephs, thinks, the, novel, is, centered, on, the, corrida, the, bullfighting, and, how, each, character, reacts, to, it, brett, seduces, the, young, matador, cohn, fails, to, understand, and, expects, to, be, bored, jake, understands, fully, because, only, he, moves, between, the, world, of, the, inauthentic, expatriates, and, the, authentic, spaniards, the, hotel, keeper, montoya, is, the, keeper, of, the, faith, and, romero, is, the, artist, in, the, ring, he, is, both, innocent, and, perfect, and, the, one, who, bravely, faces, death, the, corrida, is, presented, as, an, idealized, drama, in, which, the, matador, faces, death, creating, a, moment, of, existentialism, or, nada, nothingness, broken, when, he, vanquishes, death, by, killing, the, bull, hemingway, presents, matadors, as, heroic, characters, dancing, in, a, bullring, he, considered, the, bullring, as, war, with, precise, rules, in, contrast, to, the, messiness, of, the, real, war, that, he, and, by, extension, jake, experienced, critic, keneth, kinnamon, argues, that, young, romero, is, the, novel, s, only, honorable, character, hemingway, named, romero, after, pedro, romero, an, 18th, century, bullfighter, who, killed, thousands, of, bulls, in, the, most, difficult, manner, having, the, bull, impale, itself, on, his, sword, as, he, stood, perfectly, still, reynolds, says, romero, who, symbolizes, the, classically, pure, matador, is, the, one, idealized, figure, in, the, novel, josephs, says, that, when, hemingway, changed, romero, s, name, from, guerrita, and, imbued, him, with, the, characteristics, of, the, historical, romero, he, also, changed, the, scene, in, which, romero, kills, a, bull, to, one, of, recibiendo, receiving, the, bull, in, homage, to, the, historical, namesake, before, the, group, arrives, in, pamplona, jake, and, bill, take, a, fishing, trip, to, the, irati, river, as, harold, bloom, points, out, the, scene, serves, as, an, interlude, between, the, paris, and, pamplona, sections, an, oasis, that, exists, outside, linear, time, on, another, level, it, reflects, the, mainstream, of, american, fiction, beginning, with, the, pilgrims, seeking, refuge, from, english, oppression, the, prominent, theme, in, american, literature, of, escaping, into, the, wilderness, as, seen, in, cooper, hawthorne, melville, twain, and, thoreau, fiedler, calls, the, theme, the, sacred, land, he, thinks, the, american, west, is, evoked, in, the, sun, also, rises, by, the, pyrenees, and, given, a, symbolic, nod, with, the, name, of, the, hotel, montana, in, hemingway, s, writing, nature, is, a, place, of, refuge, and, rebirth, according, to, stoltzfus, where, the, hunter, or, fisherman, gains, a, moment, of, transcendence, at, the, moment, the, prey, is, killed, nature, is, the, place, where, men, act, without, women, men, fish, men, hunt, men, find, redemption, in, nature, jake, and, bill, do, not, need, to, discuss, the, war, because, their, war, experience, paradoxically, is, ever, present, the, nature, scenes, serve, as, counterpoint, to, the, fiesta, scenes, all, of, the, characters, drink, heavily, during, the, fiesta, and, generally, throughout, the, novel, in, his, essay, alcoholism, in, hemingway, s, the, sun, also, rises, matts, djos, says, the, main, characters, exhibit, alcoholic, tendencies, such, as, depression, anxiety, and, sexual, inadequacy, he, writes, that, jake, s, self, pity, is, symptomatic, of, an, alcoholic, as, is, brett, s, out, of, control, behavior, william, balassi, thinks, that, jake, gets, drunk, to, avoid, his, feelings, for, brett, notably, in, the, madrid, scenes, at, the, end, where, he, has, three, martinis, before, lunch, and, drinks, three, bottles, of, wine, with, lunch, reynolds, however, believes, the, drinking, is, relevant, as, set, against, the, historical, context, of, prohibition, in, the, united, states, the, atmosphere, of, the, fiesta, lends, itself, to, drunkenness, but, the, degree, of, revelry, among, the, americans, also, reflects, a, reaction, against, prohibition, bill, visiting, from, the, us, drinks, in, paris, and, in, spain, jake, is, rarely, drunk, in, paris, where, he, works, but, on, vacation, in, pamplona, he, drinks, constantly, reynolds, says, that, prohibition, split, attitudes, about, morality, and, in, the, novel, hemingway, made, clear, his, dislike, of, prohibition, critics, have, seen, jake, as, an, ambiguous, representative, of, hemingway, manliness, for, example, in, the, bar, scene, in, paris, jake, is, angry, at, some, homosexual, men, the, critic, ira, elliot, suggests, that, hemingway, viewed, homosexuality, as, an, inauthentic, way, of, life, and, that, he, aligns, jake, with, homosexual, men, because, like, them, jake, does, not, have, sex, with, women, jake, s, anger, shows, his, self, hatred, at, his, inauthenticity, and, lack, of, masculinity, his, sense, of, masculine, identity, is, lost, he, is, less, than, a, man, elliot, wonders, if, jake, s, wound, perhaps, signifies, latent, homosexuality, rather, than, only, a, loss, of, masculinity, the, emphasis, in, the, novel, however, is, on, jake, s, interest, in, women, hemingway, s, writing, has, been, called, homophobic, because, of, the, language, his, characters, use, for, example, in, the, fishing, scenes, bill, confesses, his, fondness, for, jake, but, then, goes, on, to, say, i, couldn, t, tell, you, that, in, new, york, it, d, mean, i, was, a, faggot, in, contrast, to, jake, s, troubled, masculinity, romero, represents, an, ideal, masculine, identity, grounded, in, self, assurance, bravery, and, competence, the, davidsons, note, that, brett, is, attracted, to, romero, for, these, reasons, and, they, speculate, that, jake, might, be, trying, to, undermine, romero, s, masculinity, by, bringing, brett, to, him, and, thus, diminishing, his, ideal, stature, critics, have, examined, issues, of, gender, misidentification, that, are, prevalent, in, much, of, hemingway, s, work, he, was, interested, in, cross, gender, themes, as, shown, by, his, depictions, of, effeminate, men, and, boyish, women, in, his, fiction, a, woman, s, hair, is, often, symbolically, important, and, used, to, denote, gender, brett, with, her, short, hair, is, androgynous, and, compared, to, a, boy, yet, the, ambiguity, lies, in, the, fact, that, she, is, described, as, a, damned, fine, looking, woman, while, jake, is, attracted, to, this, ambiguity, romero, is, repulsed, by, it, in, keeping, with, his, strict, moral, code, he, wants, a, feminine, partner, and, rejects, brett, because, among, other, things, she, will, not, grow, her, hair, mike, lay, on, the, bed, looking, like, a, death, mask, of, himself, he, opened, his, eyes, and, looked, at, me, hello, jake, he, said, very, slowly, i, m, getting, a, little, sleep, i, ve, wanted, a, little, sleep, for, a, long, time, you, ll, sleep, mike, don, t, worry, boy, brett, s, got, a, bullfighter, mike, said, but, her, jew, has, gone, away, damned, good, thing, what, hemingway, has, been, called, antisemitic, most, notably, because, of, the, characterization, of, robert, cohn, in, the, book, the, other, characters, often, refer, to, cohn, as, a, jew, and, once, as, a, kike, shunned, by, the, other, members, of, the, group, cohn, is, characterized, as, different, unable, or, unwilling, to, understand, and, participate, in, the, fiesta, cohn, is, never, really, part, of, the, group, separated, by, his, difference, or, his, jewish, faith, barry, gross, comparing, jewish, characters, in, literature, of, the, period, commented, that, hemingway, never, lets, the, reader, forget, that, cohn, is, a, jew, not, an, unattractive, character, who, happens, to, be, a, jew, but, a, character, who, is, unattractive, because, he, is, a, jew, hemingway, critic, josephine, knopf, speculates, that, hemingway, might, have, wanted, to, depict, cohn, as, a, shlemiel, or, fool, but, she, points, out, that, cohn, lacks, the, characteristics, of, a, traditional, shlemiel, cohn, is, based, on, harold, loeb, a, fellow, writer, who, rivaled, hemingway, for, the, affections, of, duff, lady, twysden, the, real, life, inspiration, for, brett, biographer, michael, reynolds, writes, that, in, 1925, loeb, should, have, declined, hemingway, s, invitation, to, join, them, in, pamplona, before, the, trip, he, was, duff, s, lover, and, hemingway, s, friend, during, the, fiasco, of, the, fiesta, he, lost, duff, and, hemingway, s, friendship, hemingway, used, loeb, as, the, basis, of, a, character, remembered, chiefly, as, a, rich, jew, the, novel, is, well, known, for, its, style, which, is, variously, described, as, modern, hard, boiled, or, understated, as, a, novice, writer, and, journalist, in, paris, hemingway, turned, to, ezra, pound, who, had, a, reputation, as, an, unofficial, minister, of, culture, who, acted, as, mid, wife, for, new, literary, talent, to, mark, and, blue, ink, his, short, stories, from, pound, hemingway, learned, to, write, in, the, modernist, style, he, used, understatement, pared, away, sentimentalism, and, presented, images, and, scenes, without, explanations, of, meaning, most, notably, at, the, book, s, conclusion, in, which, multiple, future, possibilities, are, left, for, brett, and, jake, the, scholar, anders, hallengren, writes, that, because, hemingway, learned, from, pound, to, distrust, adjectives, he, created, a, style, in, accordance, with, the, esthetics, and, ethics, of, raising, the, emotional, temperature, towards, the, level, of, universal, truth, by, shutting, the, door, on, sentiment, on, the, subjective, f, scott, fitzgerald, told, hemingway, to, let, the, book, s, action, play, itself, out, among, its, characters, hemingway, scholar, linda, wagner, martin, writes, that, in, taking, fitzgerald, s, advice, hemingway, produced, a, novel, without, a, central, narrator, hemingway, s, book, was, a, step, ahead, it, was, the, modernist, novel, when, fitzgerald, advised, hemingway, to, trim, at, least, 2500, words, from, the, opening, sequence, which, was, 30, pages, long, hemingway, wired, the, publishers, telling, them, to, cut, the, opening, 30, pages, altogether, the, result, was, a, novel, without, a, focused, starting, point, which, was, seen, as, a, modern, perspective, and, critically, well, received, each, time, he, let, the, bull, pass, so, close, that, the, man, and, the, bull, and, the, cape, that, filled, and, pivoted, ahead, of, the, bull, were, all, one, sharply, etched, mass, it, was, all, so, slow, and, so, controlled, it, was, as, though, he, were, rocking, the, bull, to, sleep, he, made, four, veronicas, like, that, and, came, away, toward, the, applause, his, hand, on, his, hip, his, cape, on, his, arm, and, the, bull, watching, his, back, going, away, bullfighting, scene, from, the, sun, also, rises, wagner, martin, speculates, that, hemingway, may, have, wanted, to, have, a, weak, or, negative, hero, as, defined, by, edith, wharton, but, he, had, no, experience, creating, a, hero, or, protagonist, at, that, point, his, fiction, consisted, of, extremely, short, stories, not, one, of, which, featured, a, hero, the, hero, changed, during, the, writing, of, the, sun, also, rises, first, the, matador, was, the, hero, then, cohn, was, the, hero, then, brett, and, finally, hemingway, realized, maybe, there, is, not, any, hero, at, all, maybe, a, story, is, better, without, any, hero, balassi, believes, that, in, eliminating, other, characters, as, the, protagonist, hemingway, brought, jake, indirectly, into, the, role, of, the, novel, s, hero, as, a, roman, clef, the, novel, based, its, characters, on, living, people, causing, scandal, in, the, expatriate, community, hemingway, biographer, carlos, baker, writes, that, word, of, mouth, of, the, book, helped, sales, parisian, expatriates, gleefully, tried, to, match, the, fictional, characters, to, real, identities, moreover, he, writes, that, hemingway, used, prototypes, easily, found, in, the, latin, quarter, on, which, to, base, his, characters, the, early, draft, identified, the, characters, by, their, living, counterparts, jake, s, character, was, called, hem, and, brett, s, was, called, duff, although, the, novel, is, written, in, a, journalistic, style, frederic, svoboda, writes, that, the, striking, thing, about, the, work, is, how, quickly, it, moves, away, from, a, simple, recounting, of, events, jackson, benson, believes, that, hemingway, used, autobiographical, details, as, framing, devices, for, life, in, general, for, example, benson, says, that, hemingway, drew, out, his, experiences, with, what, if, scenarios, what, if, i, were, wounded, in, such, a, way, that, i, could, not, sleep, at, night, what, if, i, were, wounded, and, made, crazy, what, would, happen, if, i, were, sent, back, to, the, front, hemingway, believed, that, the, writer, could, describe, one, thing, while, an, entirely, different, thing, occurs, below, the, surface, an, approach, he, called, the, iceberg, theory, or, the, theory, of, omission, if, a, writer, of, prose, knows, enough, of, what, he, is, writing, about, he, may, omit, things, that, he, knows, and, the, reader, if, the, writer, is, writing, truly, enough, will, have, a, feeling, of, those, things, as, strongly, as, though, the, writer, had, stated, them, the, dignity, of, movement, of, an, ice, berg, is, due, to, only, one, eighth, of, it, being, above, water, a, writer, who, omits, things, because, he, does, not, know, them, only, makes, hollow, places, in, his, writing, hemingway, explained, the, iceberg, theory, in, death, in, the, afternoon, 1932, balassi, says, hemingway, applied, the, iceberg, theory, better, in, the, sun, also, rises, than, in, any, of, his, other, works, by, editing, extraneous, material, or, purposely, leaving, gaps, in, the, story, he, made, editorial, remarks, in, the, manuscript, that, show, he, wanted, to, break, from, the, stricture, of, gertrude, stein, s, advice, to, use, clear, restrained, writing, in, the, earliest, draft, the, novel, begins, in, pamplona, but, hemingway, moved, the, opening, setting, to, paris, because, he, thought, the, montparnasse, life, was, necessary, as, a, counterpoint, to, the, later, action, in, spain, he, wrote, of, paris, extensively, intending, not, to, be, limited, by, the, literary, theories, of, others, to, write, in, his, own, way, and, possibly, to, fail, he, added, metaphors, for, each, character, mike, s, money, problems, brett, s, association, with, the, circe, myth, robert, s, association, with, the, segregated, steer, it, wasn, t, until, the, revision, process, that, he, pared, down, the, story, taking, out, unnecessary, explanations, minimizing, descriptive, passages, and, stripping, the, dialogue, all, of, which, created, a, complex, but, tightly, compressed, story, hemingway, said, that, he, learned, what, he, needed, as, a, foundation, for, his, writing, from, the, style, sheet, for, the, kansas, city, star, where, he, worked, as, cub, reporter, the, critic, john, aldridge, says, that, the, minimalist, style, resulted, from, hemingway, s, belief, that, to, write, authentically, each, word, had, to, be, carefully, chosen, for, its, simplicity, and, authenticity, and, carry, a, great, deal, of, weight, aldridge, writes, that, hemingway, s, style, of, a, minimum, of, simple, words, that, seemed, to, be, squeezed, onto, the, page, against, a, great, compulsion, to, be, silent, creates, the, impression, that, those, words, if, only, because, there, are, so, few, of, them, are, sacramental, in, paris, hemingway, had, been, experimenting, with, the, prosody, of, the, king, james, bible, reading, aloud, with, his, friend, john, dos, passos, from, the, style, of, the, biblical, text, he, learned, to, build, his, prose, incrementally, the, action, in, the, novel, builds, sentence, by, sentence, scene, by, scene, and, chapter, by, chapter, the, simplicity, of, his, style, is, deceptive, bloom, writes, that, it, is, the, effective, use, of, parataxis, that, elevates, hemingway, s, prose, drawing, on, the, bible, walt, whitman, and, adventures, of, huckleberry, finn, hemingway, wrote, in, deliberate, understatement, and, he, heavily, incorporated, parataxis, which, in, some, cases, almost, becomes, cinematic, his, skeletal, sentences, were, crafted, in, response, to, henry, james, s, observation, that, world, war, i, had, used, up, words, explains, hemingway, scholar, zoe, trodd, who, writes, that, his, style, is, similar, to, a, multi, focal, photographic, reality, the, syntax, which, lacks, subordinating, conjunctions, creates, static, sentences, the, photographic, snapshot, style, creates, a, collage, of, images, hemingway, omits, internal, punctuation, colons, semicolons, dashes, parentheses, in, favor, of, short, declarative, sentences, which, are, meant, to, build, as, events, build, to, create, a, sense, of, the, whole, he, also, uses, techniques, analogous, to, cinema, such, as, cutting, quickly, from, one, scene, to, the, next, or, splicing, one, scene, into, another, intentional, omissions, allow, the, reader, to, fill, the, gap, as, though, responding, to, instructions, from, the, author, and, create, three, dimensional, prose, biographer, james, mellow, writes, that, the, bullfighting, scenes, are, presented, with, a, crispness, and, clarity, that, evoke, the, sense, of, a, newsreel, hemingway, also, uses, color, and, visual, art, techniques, to, convey, emotional, range, in, his, descriptions, of, the, irati, river, in, translating, modernism, fitzgerald, and, hemingway, ronald, berman, compares, hemingway, s, treatment, of, landscape, with, that, of, the, post, impressionist, painter, paul, c, zanne, during, a, 1949, interview, hemingway, told, lillian, ross, that, he, learned, from, c, zanne, how, to, make, a, landscape, in, comparing, writing, to, painting, he, told, her, this, is, what, we, try, to, do, in, writing, this, and, this, and, woods, and, the, rocks, we, have, to, climb, over, the, landscape, is, seen, subjectively, the, viewpoint, of, the, observer, is, paramount, to, jake, landscape, meant, a, search, for, a, solid, form, not, existentially, present, in, life, in, paris, hemingway, s, first, novel, was, arguably, his, best, and, most, important, and, came, to, be, seen, as, an, iconic, modernist, novel, although, reynolds, emphasizes, that, hemingway, was, not, philosophically, a, modernist, in, the, book, his, characters, epitomized, the, post, war, expatriate, generation, for, future, generations, he, had, received, good, reviews, for, his, volume, of, short, stories, in, our, time, of, which, edmund, wilson, wrote, hemingway, s, prose, was, of, the, first, distinction, wilson, s, comments, were, enough, to, bring, attention, to, the, young, writer, no, amount, of, analysis, can, convey, the, quality, of, the, sun, also, rises, it, is, a, truly, gripping, story, told, in, a, lean, hard, athletic, narrative, prose, that, puts, more, literary, english, to, shame, mr, hemingway, knows, how, not, only, to, make, words, be, specific, but, how, to, arrange, a, collection, of, words, which, shall, betray, a, great, deal, more, than, is, to, be, found, in, the, individual, parts, it, is, magnificent, writing, the, new, york, times, review, of, the, sun, also, rises, 31, october, 1926, good, reviews, came, in, from, many, major, publications, conrad, aiken, wrote, in, the, new, york, herald, tribune, if, there, is, a, better, dialogue, to, be, written, today, i, do, not, know, where, to, find, it, and, bruce, barton, wrote, in, the, atlantic, that, hemingway, writes, as, if, he, had, never, read, anybody, s, writing, as, if, he, had, fashioned, the, art, of, writing, himself, and, that, the, characters, are, amazingly, real, and, alive, many, reviewers, among, them, h, l, mencken, praised, hemingway, s, style, use, of, understatement, and, tight, writing, other, critics, however, disliked, the, novel, the, nation, s, critic, believed, hemingway, s, hard, boiled, style, was, better, suited, to, the, short, stories, published, in, in, our, time, than, his, novel, writing, in, the, new, masses, hemingway, s, friend, john, dos, passos, asked, what, s, the, matter, with, american, writing, these, days, the, few, unsad, young, men, of, this, lost, generation, will, have, to, look, for, another, way, of, finding, themselves, than, the, one, indicated, here, privately, he, wrote, hemingway, an, apology, for, the, review, the, reviewer, for, the, chicago, daily, tribune, wrote, of, the, novel, the, sun, also, rises, is, the, kind, of, book, that, makes, this, reviewer, at, least, almost, plain, angry, some, reviewers, disliked, the, characters, among, them, the, reviewer, for, the, dial, who, thought, the, characters, were, shallow, and, vapid, and, the, nation, and, atheneum, deemed, the, characters, boring, and, the, novel, unimportant, the, reviewer, for, the, cincinnati, enquirer, wrote, of, the, book, that, it, begins, nowhere, and, ends, in, nothing, hemingway, s, family, hated, it, his, mother, grace, hemingway, distressed, that, she, could, not, face, the, criticism, at, her, local, book, study, class, where, it, was, said, that, her, son, was, prostituting, a, great, ability, to, the, lowest, uses, expressed, her, displeasure, in, a, letter, to, him, the, critics, seem, to, be, full, of, praise, for, your, style, and, ability, to, draw, word, pictures, but, the, decent, ones, always, regret, that, you, should, use, such, great, gifts, in, perpetuating, the, lives, and, habits, of, so, degraded, a, strata, of, humanity, it, is, a, doubtful, honor, to, produce, one, of, the, filthiest, books, of, the, year, what, is, the, matter, have, you, ceased, to, be, interested, in, nobility, honor, and, fineness, in, life, surely, you, have, other, words, in, your, vocabulary, than, damn, and, bitch, every, page, fills, me, with, a, sick, loathing, still, the, book, sold, well, and, young, women, began, to, emulate, brett, while, male, students, at, ivy, league, universities, wanted, to, become, hemingway, heroes, scribner, s, encouraged, the, publicity, and, allowed, hemingway, to, become, a, minor, american, phenomenon, a, celebrity, to, the, point, that, his, divorce, from, richardson, and, marriage, to, pfeiffer, attracted, media, attention, reynolds, believes, the, sun, also, rises, could, have, been, written, only, circa, 1925, it, perfectly, captured, the, period, between, world, war, i, and, the, great, depression, and, immortalized, a, group, of, characters, in, the, years, since, its, publication, the, novel, has, been, criticized, for, its, antisemitism, as, expressed, in, the, characterization, of, robert, cohn, reynolds, explains, that, although, the, publishers, complained, to, hemingway, about, his, description, of, bulls, they, allowed, his, use, of, jewish, epithets, which, showed, the, degree, to, which, antisemitism, was, accepted, in, the, us, after, world, war, i, hemingway, clearly, makes, cohn, unlikeable, not, only, as, a, character, but, as, a, character, who, is, jewish, critics, of, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, considered, hemingway, to, be, misogynistic, and, homophobic, by, the, 1990s, his, work, including, the, sun, also, rises, began, to, receive, critical, reconsideration, by, female, scholars, hemingway, s, work, continued, to, be, popular, in, the, latter, half, of, the, century, and, after, his, suicide, in, 1961, during, the, 1970s, the, sun, also, rises, appealed, to, what, beegel, calls, the, lost, generation, of, the, vietnam, era, aldridge, writes, that, the, sun, also, rises, has, kept, its, appeal, because, the, novel, is, about, being, young, the, characters, live, in, the, most, beautiful, city, in, the, world, spend, their, days, traveling, fishing, drinking, making, love, and, generally, reveling, in, their, youth, he, believes, the, expatriate, writers, of, the, 1920s, appeal, for, this, reason, but, that, hemingway, was, the, most, successful, in, capturing, the, time, and, the, place, in, the, sun, also, rises, bloom, says, that, some, of, the, characters, have, not, stood, the, test, of, time, writing, that, modern, readers, are, uncomfortable, with, the, antisemitic, treatment, of, cohn, s, character, and, the, romanticization, of, a, bullfighter, moreover, brett, and, mike, belong, uniquely, to, the, jazz, age, and, do, not, translate, to, the, modern, era, bloom, believes, the, novel, is, in, the, canon, of, american, literature, for, its, formal, qualities, its, prose, and, style, the, novel, made, hemingway, famous, inspired, young, women, across, america, to, wear, short, hair, and, sweater, sets, like, the, heroine, s, and, to, act, like, her, too, and, changed, writing, style, in, ways, that, could, be, seen, in, any, american, magazine, published, in, the, next, twenty, years, in, many, ways, the, novel, s, stripped, down, prose, became, a, model, for, 20th, century, american, writing, nagel, writes, that, the, sun, also, rises, was, a, dramatic, literary, event, and, its, effects, have, not, diminished, over, the, years, the, success, of, the, sun, also, rises, led, to, interest, from, broadway, and, hollywood, in, 1927, two, broadway, producers, wanted, to, adapt, the, story, for, the, stage, but, made, no, immediate, offers, hemingway, considered, marketing, the, story, directly, to, hollywood, telling, his, editor, max, perkins, that, he, would, not, sell, it, for, less, than, 30, 000, money, he, wanted, his, estranged, wife, hadley, richardson, to, have, conrad, aiken, thought, the, book, was, perfect, for, a, film, adaptation, solely, on, the, strength, of, dialogue, hemingway, would, not, see, a, stage, or, film, adaption, anytime, soon, he, sold, the, film, rights, to, rko, pictures, in, 1932, but, only, in, 1956, was, the, novel, adapted, to, a, film, of, the, same, name, peter, viertel, wrote, the, screenplay, tyrone, power, as, jake, played, the, lead, role, opposite, ava, gardner, as, brett, and, errol, flynn, as, mike,
