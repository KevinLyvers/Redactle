surrealism, is, an, art, and, cultural, movement, that, developed, in, europe, in, the, aftermath, of, world, war, i, in, which, artists, aimed, to, allow, the, unconscious, mind, to, express, itself, often, resulting, in, the, depiction, of, illogical, or, dreamlike, scenes, and, ideas, its, intention, was, according, to, leader, andr, breton, to, resolve, the, previously, contradictory, conditions, of, dream, and, reality, into, an, absolute, reality, a, super, reality, or, surreality, it, produced, works, of, painting, writing, theatre, filmmaking, photography, and, other, media, as, well, works, of, surrealism, feature, the, element, of, surprise, unexpected, juxtapositions, and, non, sequitur, however, many, surrealist, artists, and, writers, regard, their, work, as, an, expression, of, the, philosophical, movement, first, and, foremost, for, instance, of, the, pure, psychic, automatism, breton, speaks, of, in, the, first, surrealist, manifesto, with, the, works, themselves, being, secondary, i, e, artifacts, of, surrealist, experimentation, leader, breton, was, explicit, in, his, assertion, that, surrealism, was, above, all, a, revolutionary, movement, at, the, time, the, movement, was, associated, with, political, causes, such, as, communism, and, anarchism, it, was, influenced, by, the, dada, movement, of, the, 1910s, the, term, surrealism, originated, with, guillaume, apollinaire, in, 1917, however, the, surrealist, movement, was, not, officially, established, until, after, october, 1924, when, the, surrealist, manifesto, published, by, french, poet, and, critic, andr, breton, succeeded, in, claiming, the, term, for, his, group, over, a, rival, faction, led, by, yvan, goll, who, had, published, his, own, surrealist, manifesto, two, weeks, prior, the, most, important, center, of, the, movement, was, paris, france, from, the, 1920s, onward, the, movement, spread, around, the, globe, impacting, the, visual, arts, literature, film, and, music, of, many, countries, and, languages, as, well, as, political, thought, and, practice, philosophy, and, social, theory, the, word, surrealism, was, first, coined, in, march, 1917, by, guillaume, apollinaire, he, wrote, in, a, letter, to, paul, derm, e, all, things, considered, i, think, in, fact, it, is, better, to, adopt, surrealism, than, supernaturalism, which, i, first, used, apollinaire, used, the, term, in, his, program, notes, for, sergei, diaghilev, s, ballets, russes, parade, which, premiered, 18, may, 1917, parade, had, a, one, act, scenario, by, jean, cocteau, and, was, performed, with, music, by, erik, satie, cocteau, described, the, ballet, as, realistic, apollinaire, went, further, describing, parade, as, surrealistic, this, new, alliance, i, say, new, because, until, now, scenery, and, costumes, were, linked, only, by, factitious, bonds, has, given, rise, in, parade, to, a, kind, of, surrealism, which, i, consider, to, be, the, point, of, departure, for, a, whole, series, of, manifestations, of, the, new, spirit, that, is, making, itself, felt, today, and, that, will, certainly, appeal, to, our, best, minds, we, may, expect, it, to, bring, about, profound, changes, in, our, arts, and, manners, through, universal, joyfulness, for, it, is, only, natural, after, all, that, they, keep, pace, with, scientific, and, industrial, progress, apollinaire, 1917, the, term, was, taken, up, again, by, apollinaire, both, as, subtitle, and, in, the, preface, to, his, play, les, mamelles, de, tir, sias, drame, surr, aliste, which, was, written, in, 1903, and, first, performed, in, 1917, world, war, i, scattered, the, writers, and, artists, who, had, been, based, in, paris, and, in, the, interim, many, became, involved, with, dada, believing, that, excessive, rational, thought, and, bourgeois, values, had, brought, the, conflict, of, the, war, upon, the, world, the, dadaists, protested, with, anti, art, gatherings, performances, writings, and, art, works, after, the, war, when, they, returned, to, paris, the, dada, activities, continued, during, the, war, andr, breton, who, had, trained, in, medicine, and, psychiatry, served, in, a, neurological, hospital, where, he, used, sigmund, freud, s, psychoanalytic, methods, with, soldiers, suffering, from, shell, shock, meeting, the, young, writer, jacques, vach, breton, felt, that, vach, was, the, spiritual, son, of, writer, and, pataphysics, founder, alfred, jarry, he, admired, the, young, writer, s, anti, social, attitude, and, disdain, for, established, artistic, tradition, later, breton, wrote, in, literature, i, was, successively, taken, with, rimbaud, with, jarry, with, apollinaire, with, nouveau, with, lautr, amont, but, it, is, jacques, vach, to, whom, i, owe, the, most, back, in, paris, breton, joined, in, dada, activities, and, started, the, literary, journal, litt, rature, along, with, louis, aragon, and, philippe, soupault, they, began, experimenting, with, automatic, writing, spontaneously, writing, without, censoring, their, thoughts, and, published, the, writings, as, well, as, accounts, of, dreams, in, the, magazine, breton, and, soupault, continued, writing, evolving, their, techniques, of, automatism, and, published, the, magnetic, fields, 1920, by, october, 1924, two, rival, surrealist, groups, had, formed, to, publish, a, surrealist, manifesto, each, claimed, to, be, successors, of, a, revolution, launched, by, appolinaire, one, group, led, by, yvan, goll, consisted, of, pierre, albert, birot, paul, derm, e, c, line, arnauld, francis, picabia, tristan, tzara, giuseppe, ungaretti, pierre, reverdy, marcel, arland, joseph, delteil, jean, painlev, and, robert, delaunay, among, others, the, group, led, by, andr, breton, claimed, that, automatism, was, a, better, tactic, for, societal, change, than, those, of, dada, as, led, by, tzara, who, was, now, among, their, rivals, breton, s, group, grew, to, include, writers, and, artists, from, various, media, such, as, paul, luard, benjamin, p, ret, ren, crevel, robert, desnos, jacques, baron, max, morise, pierre, naville, roger, vitrac, gala, luard, max, ernst, salvador, dal, luis, bu, uel, man, ray, hans, arp, georges, malkine, michel, leiris, georges, limbour, antonin, artaud, raymond, queneau, andr, masson, joan, mir, marcel, duchamp, jacques, pr, vert, and, yves, tanguy, dora, maar, as, they, developed, their, philosophy, they, believed, that, surrealism, would, advocate, the, idea, that, ordinary, and, depictive, expressions, are, vital, and, important, but, that, the, sense, of, their, arrangement, must, be, open, to, the, full, range, of, imagination, according, to, the, hegelian, dialectic, they, also, looked, to, the, marxist, dialectic, and, the, work, of, such, theorists, as, walter, benjamin, and, herbert, marcuse, freud, s, work, with, free, association, dream, analysis, and, the, unconscious, was, of, utmost, importance, to, the, surrealists, in, developing, methods, to, liberate, imagination, they, embraced, idiosyncrasy, while, rejecting, the, idea, of, an, underlying, madness, as, dal, later, proclaimed, there, is, only, one, difference, between, a, madman, and, me, i, am, not, mad, beside, the, use, of, dream, analysis, they, emphasized, that, one, could, combine, inside, the, same, frame, elements, not, normally, found, together, to, produce, illogical, and, startling, effects, breton, included, the, idea, of, the, startling, juxtapositions, in, his, 1924, manifesto, taking, it, in, turn, from, a, 1918, essay, by, poet, pierre, reverdy, which, said, a, juxtaposition, of, two, more, or, less, distant, realities, the, more, the, relationship, between, the, two, juxtaposed, realities, is, distant, and, true, the, stronger, the, image, will, be, the, greater, its, emotional, power, and, poetic, reality, the, group, aimed, to, revolutionize, human, experience, in, its, personal, cultural, social, and, political, aspects, they, wanted, to, free, people, from, false, rationality, and, restrictive, customs, and, structures, breton, proclaimed, that, the, true, aim, of, surrealism, was, long, live, the, social, revolution, and, it, alone, to, this, goal, at, various, times, surrealists, aligned, with, communism, and, anarchism, in, 1924, two, surrealist, factions, declared, their, philosophy, in, two, separate, surrealist, manifestos, that, same, year, the, bureau, of, surrealist, research, was, established, and, began, publishing, the, journal, la, r, volution, surr, aliste, leading, up, to, 1924, two, rival, surrealist, groups, had, formed, each, group, claimed, to, be, successors, of, a, revolution, launched, by, apollinaire, one, group, led, by, yvan, goll, consisted, of, pierre, albert, birot, paul, derm, e, c, line, arnauld, francis, picabia, tristan, tzara, giuseppe, ungaretti, pierre, reverdy, marcel, arland, joseph, delteil, jean, painlev, and, robert, delaunay, among, others, the, other, group, led, by, breton, included, aragon, desnos, luard, baron, crevel, malkine, jacques, andr, boiffard, and, jean, carrive, among, others, yvan, goll, published, the, manifeste, du, surr, alisme, 1, october, 1924, in, his, first, and, only, issue, of, surr, alisme, two, weeks, prior, to, the, release, of, breton, s, manifeste, du, surr, alisme, published, by, ditions, du, sagittaire, 15, october, 1924, goll, and, breton, clashed, openly, at, one, point, literally, fighting, at, the, com, die, des, champs, lys, es, over, the, rights, to, the, term, surrealism, in, the, end, breton, won, the, battle, through, tactical, and, numerical, superiority, though, the, quarrel, over, the, anteriority, of, surrealism, concluded, with, the, victory, of, breton, the, history, of, surrealism, from, that, moment, would, remain, marked, by, fractures, resignations, and, resounding, excommunications, with, each, surrealist, having, their, own, view, of, the, issue, and, goals, and, accepting, more, or, less, the, definitions, laid, out, by, andr, breton, breton, s, 1924, surrealist, manifesto, defines, the, purposes, of, surrealism, he, included, citations, of, the, influences, on, surrealism, examples, of, surrealist, works, and, discussion, of, surrealist, automatism, he, provided, the, following, definitions, dictionary, surrealism, n, pure, psychic, automatism, by, which, one, proposes, to, express, either, verbally, in, writing, or, by, any, other, manner, the, real, functioning, of, thought, dictation, of, thought, in, the, absence, of, all, control, exercised, by, reason, outside, of, all, aesthetic, and, moral, preoccupation, encyclopedia, surrealism, philosophy, surrealism, is, based, on, the, belief, in, the, superior, reality, of, certain, forms, of, previously, neglected, associations, in, the, omnipotence, of, dream, in, the, disinterested, play, of, thought, it, tends, to, ruin, once, and, for, all, other, psychic, mechanisms, and, to, substitute, itself, for, them, in, solving, all, the, principal, problems, of, life, the, movement, in, the, mid, 1920s, was, characterized, by, meetings, in, cafes, where, the, surrealists, played, collaborative, drawing, games, discussed, the, theories, of, surrealism, and, developed, a, variety, of, techniques, such, as, automatic, drawing, breton, initially, doubted, that, visual, arts, could, even, be, useful, in, the, surrealist, movement, since, they, appeared, to, be, less, malleable, and, open, to, chance, and, automatism, this, caution, was, overcome, by, the, discovery, of, such, techniques, as, frottage, grattage, and, decalcomania, soon, more, visual, artists, became, involved, including, giorgio, de, chirico, max, ernst, joan, mir, francis, picabia, yves, tanguy, salvador, dal, luis, bu, uel, alberto, giacometti, valentine, hugo, m, ret, oppenheim, toyen, kansuke, yamamoto, and, later, after, the, second, war, enrico, donati, vinicius, pradella, and, denis, fabbri, though, breton, admired, pablo, picasso, and, marcel, duchamp, and, courted, them, to, join, the, movement, they, remained, peripheral, more, writers, also, joined, including, former, dadaist, tristan, tzara, ren, char, and, georges, sadoul, in, 1925, an, autonomous, surrealist, group, formed, in, brussels, the, group, included, the, musician, poet, and, artist, e, l, t, mesens, painter, and, writer, ren, magritte, paul, noug, marcel, lecomte, and, andr, souris, in, 1927, they, were, joined, by, the, writer, louis, scutenaire, they, corresponded, regularly, with, the, paris, group, and, in, 1927, both, goemans, and, magritte, moved, to, paris, and, frequented, breton, s, circle, the, artists, with, their, roots, in, dada, and, cubism, the, abstraction, of, wassily, kandinsky, expressionism, and, post, impressionism, also, reached, to, older, bloodlines, or, proto, surrealists, such, as, hieronymus, bosch, and, the, so, called, primitive, and, naive, arts, andr, masson, s, automatic, drawings, of, 1923, are, often, used, as, the, point, of, the, acceptance, of, visual, arts, and, the, break, from, dada, since, they, reflect, the, influence, of, the, idea, of, the, unconscious, mind, another, example, is, giacometti, s, 1925, torso, which, marked, his, movement, to, simplified, forms, and, inspiration, from, preclassical, sculpture, however, a, striking, example, of, the, line, used, to, divide, dada, and, surrealism, among, art, experts, is, the, pairing, of, 1925, s, little, machine, constructed, by, minimax, dadamax, in, person, von, minimax, dadamax, selbst, konstruiertes, maschinchen, with, the, kiss, le, baiser, from, 1927, by, max, ernst, the, first, is, generally, held, to, have, a, distance, and, erotic, subtext, whereas, the, second, presents, an, erotic, act, openly, and, directly, in, the, second, the, influence, of, mir, and, the, drawing, style, of, picasso, is, visible, with, the, use, of, fluid, curving, and, intersecting, lines, and, colour, whereas, the, first, takes, a, directness, that, would, later, be, influential, in, movements, such, as, pop, art, giorgio, de, chirico, and, his, previous, development, of, metaphysical, art, was, one, of, the, important, joining, figures, between, the, philosophical, and, visual, aspects, of, surrealism, between, 1911, and, 1917, he, adopted, an, unornamented, depictional, style, whose, surface, would, be, adopted, by, others, later, the, red, tower, la, tour, rouge, from, 1913, shows, the, stark, colour, contrasts, and, illustrative, style, later, adopted, by, surrealist, painters, his, 1914, the, nostalgia, of, the, poet, la, nostalgie, du, po, te, has, the, figure, turned, away, from, the, viewer, and, the, juxtaposition, of, a, bust, with, glasses, and, a, fish, as, a, relief, defies, conventional, explanation, he, was, also, a, writer, whose, novel, hebdomeros, presents, a, series, of, dreamscapes, with, an, unusual, use, of, punctuation, syntax, and, grammar, designed, to, create, an, atmosphere, and, frame, its, images, his, images, including, set, designs, for, the, ballets, russes, would, create, a, decorative, form, of, surrealism, and, he, would, be, an, influence, on, the, two, artists, who, would, be, even, more, closely, associated, with, surrealism, in, the, public, mind, dal, and, magritte, he, would, however, leave, the, surrealist, group, in, 1928, in, 1924, mir, and, masson, applied, surrealism, to, painting, the, first, surrealist, exhibition, la, peinture, surrealiste, was, held, at, galerie, pierre, in, paris, in, 1925, it, displayed, works, by, masson, man, ray, paul, klee, mir, and, others, the, show, confirmed, that, surrealism, had, a, component, in, the, visual, arts, though, it, had, been, initially, debated, whether, this, was, possible, and, techniques, from, dada, such, as, photomontage, were, used, the, following, year, on, march, 26, 1926, galerie, surr, aliste, opened, with, an, exhibition, by, man, ray, breton, published, surrealism, and, painting, in, 1928, which, summarized, the, movement, to, that, point, though, he, continued, to, update, the, work, until, the, 1960s, the, first, surrealist, work, according, to, leader, br, ton, was, les, chants, de, maldoror, and, the, first, work, written, and, published, by, his, group, of, surr, alistes, was, les, champs, magn, tiques, may, june, 1919, litt, rature, contained, automatist, works, and, accounts, of, dreams, the, magazine, and, the, portfolio, both, showed, their, disdain, for, literal, meanings, given, to, objects, and, focused, rather, on, the, undertones, the, poetic, undercurrents, present, not, only, did, they, give, emphasis, to, the, poetic, undercurrents, but, also, to, the, connotations, and, the, overtones, which, exist, in, ambiguous, relationships, to, the, visual, images, because, surrealist, writers, seldom, if, ever, appear, to, organize, their, thoughts, and, the, images, they, present, some, people, find, much, of, their, work, difficult, to, parse, this, notion, however, is, a, superficial, comprehension, prompted, no, doubt, by, breton, s, initial, emphasis, on, automatic, writing, as, the, main, route, toward, a, higher, reality, but, as, in, breton, s, case, much, of, what, is, presented, as, purely, automatic, is, actually, edited, and, very, thought, out, breton, himself, later, admitted, that, automatic, writing, s, centrality, had, been, overstated, and, other, elements, were, introduced, especially, as, the, growing, involvement, of, visual, artists, in, the, movement, forced, the, issue, since, automatic, painting, required, a, rather, more, strenuous, set, of, approaches, thus, such, elements, as, collage, were, introduced, arising, partly, from, an, ideal, of, startling, juxtapositions, as, revealed, in, pierre, reverdy, s, poetry, and, as, in, magritte, s, case, where, there, is, no, obvious, recourse, to, either, automatic, techniques, or, collage, the, very, notion, of, convulsive, joining, became, a, tool, for, revelation, in, and, of, itself, surrealism, was, meant, to, be, always, in, flux, to, be, more, modern, than, modern, and, so, it, was, natural, there, should, be, a, rapid, shuffling, of, the, philosophy, as, new, challenges, arose, artists, such, as, max, ernst, and, his, surrealist, collages, demonstrate, this, shift, to, a, more, modern, art, form, that, also, comments, on, society, surrealists, revived, interest, in, isidore, ducasse, known, by, his, pseudonym, comte, de, lautr, amont, and, for, the, line, beautiful, as, the, chance, meeting, on, a, dissecting, table, of, a, sewing, machine, and, an, umbrella, and, arthur, rimbaud, two, late, 19th, century, writers, believed, to, be, the, precursors, of, surrealism, examples, of, surrealist, literature, are, artaud, s, le, p, se, nerfs, 1926, aragon, s, irene, s, cunt, 1927, p, ret, s, death, to, the, pigs, 1929, crevel, s, mr, knife, miss, fork, 1931, sadegh, hedayat, s, the, blind, owl, 1937, and, breton, s, sur, la, route, de, san, romano, 1948, la, r, volution, surr, aliste, continued, publication, into, 1929, with, most, pages, densely, packed, with, columns, of, text, but, which, also, included, reproductions, of, art, among, them, works, by, de, chirico, ernst, masson, and, man, ray, other, works, included, books, poems, pamphlets, automatic, texts, and, theoretical, tracts, early, films, by, surrealists, include, famous, surrealist, photographers, are, the, french, dora, maar, the, american, man, ray, the, french, hungarian, brassa, french, claude, cahun, and, the, dutch, emiel, van, moerkerken, the, word, surrealist, was, first, used, by, apollinaire, to, describe, his, 1917, play, les, mamelles, de, tir, sias, the, breasts, of, tiresias, which, was, later, adapted, into, an, opera, by, francis, poulenc, roger, vitrac, s, the, mysteries, of, love, 1927, and, victor, or, the, children, take, over, 1928, are, often, considered, the, best, examples, of, surrealist, theatre, despite, his, expulsion, from, the, movement, in, 1926, the, plays, were, staged, at, the, theatre, alfred, jarry, the, theatre, vitrac, co, founded, with, antonin, artaud, another, early, surrealist, who, was, expelled, from, the, movement, following, his, collaboration, with, vitrac, artaud, would, extend, surrealist, thought, through, his, theory, of, the, theatre, of, cruelty, artaud, rejected, the, majority, of, western, theatre, as, a, perversion, of, its, original, intent, which, he, felt, should, be, a, mystical, metaphysical, experience, instead, he, envisioned, a, theatre, that, would, be, immediate, and, direct, linking, the, unconscious, minds, of, performers, and, spectators, in, a, sort, of, ritual, event, artaud, created, in, which, emotions, feelings, and, the, metaphysical, were, expressed, not, through, language, but, physically, creating, a, mythological, archetypal, allegorical, vision, closely, related, to, the, world, of, dreams, the, spanish, playwright, and, director, federico, garc, a, lorca, also, experimented, with, surrealism, particularly, in, his, plays, the, public, 1930, when, five, years, pass, 1931, and, play, without, a, title, 1935, other, surrealist, plays, include, aragon, s, backs, to, the, wall, 1925, gertrude, stein, s, opera, doctor, faustus, lights, the, lights, 1938, has, also, been, described, as, american, surrealism, though, it, is, also, related, to, a, theatrical, form, of, cubism, in, the, 1920s, several, composers, were, influenced, by, surrealism, or, by, individuals, in, the, surrealist, movement, among, them, were, bohuslav, martin, andr, souris, erik, satie, francis, poulenc, and, edgard, var, se, who, stated, that, his, work, arcana, was, drawn, from, a, dream, sequence, souris, in, particular, was, associated, with, the, movement, he, had, a, long, relationship, with, magritte, and, worked, on, paul, noug, s, publication, adieu, marie, music, by, composers, from, across, the, twentieth, century, have, been, associated, with, surrealist, principles, including, pierre, boulez, gy, rgy, ligeti, mauricio, kagel, olivier, messiaen, and, thomas, ad, s, germaine, tailleferre, of, the, french, group, les, six, wrote, several, works, which, could, be, considered, to, be, inspired, by, surrealism, including, the, 1948, ballet, paris, magie, scenario, by, lise, deharme, the, operas, la, petite, sir, ne, book, by, philippe, soupault, and, le, ma, tre, book, by, eug, ne, ionesco, tailleferre, also, wrote, popular, songs, to, texts, by, claude, marci, the, wife, of, henri, jeanson, whose, portrait, had, been, painted, by, magritte, in, the, 1930s, even, though, breton, by, 1946, responded, rather, negatively, to, the, subject, of, music, with, his, essay, silence, is, golden, later, surrealists, such, as, paul, garon, have, been, interested, in, and, found, parallels, to, surrealism, in, the, improvisation, of, jazz, and, the, blues, jazz, and, blues, musicians, have, occasionally, reciprocated, this, interest, for, example, the, 1976, world, surrealist, exhibition, included, performances, by, david, honeyboy, edwards, surrealism, as, a, political, force, developed, unevenly, around, the, world, in, some, places, more, emphasis, was, on, artistic, practices, in, other, places, on, political, practices, and, in, other, places, still, surrealist, praxis, looked, to, supersede, both, the, arts, and, politics, during, the, 1930s, the, surrealist, idea, spread, from, europe, to, north, america, south, america, founding, of, the, mandr, gora, group, in, chile, in, 1938, central, america, the, caribbean, and, throughout, asia, as, both, an, artistic, idea, and, as, an, ideology, of, political, change, politically, surrealism, was, trotskyist, communist, or, anarchist, the, split, from, dada, has, been, characterised, as, a, split, between, anarchists, and, communists, with, the, surrealists, as, communist, breton, and, his, comrades, supported, leon, trotsky, and, his, international, left, opposition, for, a, while, though, there, was, an, openness, to, anarchism, that, manifested, more, fully, after, world, war, ii, some, surrealists, such, as, benjamin, p, ret, mary, low, and, juan, bre, aligned, with, forms, of, left, communism, when, the, dutch, surrealist, photographer, emiel, van, moerkerken, came, to, breton, he, did, not, want, to, sign, the, manifesto, because, he, was, not, a, trotskyist, for, breton, being, a, communist, was, not, enough, breton, denied, van, moerkerken, s, pictures, for, a, publication, afterwards, this, caused, a, split, in, surrealism, others, fought, for, complete, liberty, from, political, ideologies, like, wolfgang, paalen, who, after, trotsky, s, assassination, in, mexico, prepared, a, schism, between, art, and, politics, through, his, counter, surrealist, art, magazine, dyn, and, so, prepared, the, ground, for, the, abstract, expressionists, dal, supported, capitalism, and, the, fascist, dictatorship, of, francisco, franco, but, cannot, be, said, to, represent, a, trend, in, surrealism, in, this, respect, in, fact, he, was, considered, by, breton, and, his, associates, to, have, betrayed, and, left, surrealism, benjamin, p, ret, mary, low, juan, bre, and, spanish, native, eugenio, fern, ndez, granell, joined, the, poum, during, the, spanish, civil, war, breton, s, followers, along, with, the, communist, party, were, working, for, the, liberation, of, man, however, breton, s, group, refused, to, prioritize, the, proletarian, struggle, over, radical, creation, such, that, their, struggles, with, the, party, made, the, late, 1920s, a, turbulent, time, for, both, many, individuals, closely, associated, with, breton, notably, aragon, left, his, group, to, work, more, closely, with, the, communists, surrealists, have, often, sought, to, link, their, efforts, with, political, ideals, and, activities, in, the, declaration, of, january, 27, 1925, for, example, members, of, the, paris, based, bureau, of, surrealist, research, including, breton, aragon, and, artaud, as, well, as, some, two, dozen, others, declared, their, affinity, for, revolutionary, politics, while, this, was, initially, a, somewhat, vague, formulation, by, the, 1930s, many, surrealists, had, strongly, identified, themselves, with, communism, the, foremost, document, of, this, tendency, within, surrealism, is, the, manifesto, for, a, free, revolutionary, art, published, under, the, names, of, breton, and, diego, rivera, but, actually, co, authored, by, breton, and, leon, trotsky, however, in, 1933, the, surrealists, assertion, that, a, proletarian, literature, within, a, capitalist, society, was, impossible, led, to, their, break, with, the, association, des, ecrivains, et, artistes, r, volutionnaires, and, the, expulsion, of, breton, luard, and, crevel, from, the, communist, party, in, 1925, the, paris, surrealist, group, and, the, extreme, left, of, the, french, communist, party, came, together, to, support, abd, el, krim, leader, of, the, rif, uprising, against, french, colonialism, in, morocco, in, an, open, letter, to, writer, and, french, ambassador, to, japan, paul, claudel, the, paris, group, announced, we, surrealists, pronounced, ourselves, in, favour, of, changing, the, imperialist, war, in, its, chronic, and, colonial, form, into, a, civil, war, thus, we, placed, our, energies, at, the, disposal, of, the, revolution, of, the, proletariat, and, its, struggles, and, defined, our, attitude, towards, the, colonial, problem, and, hence, towards, the, colour, question, the, anticolonial, revolutionary, and, proletarian, politics, of, murderous, humanitarianism, 1932, which, was, drafted, mainly, by, crevel, signed, by, breton, luard, p, ret, tanguy, and, the, martiniquan, surrealists, pierre, yoyotte, and, j, m, monnerot, perhaps, makes, it, the, original, document, of, what, is, later, called, black, surrealism, although, it, is, the, contact, between, aim, c, saire, and, breton, in, the, 1940s, in, martinique, that, really, lead, to, the, communication, of, what, is, known, as, black, surrealism, anticolonial, revolutionary, writers, in, the, n, gritude, movement, of, martinique, a, french, colony, at, the, time, took, up, surrealism, as, a, revolutionary, method, a, critique, of, european, culture, and, a, radical, subjective, this, linked, with, other, surrealists, and, was, very, important, for, the, subsequent, development, of, surrealism, as, a, revolutionary, praxis, the, journal, tropiques, featuring, the, work, of, c, saire, along, with, suzanne, c, saire, ren, m, nil, lucie, th, s, e, aristide, maug, e, and, others, was, first, published, in, 1941, in, 1938, andr, breton, traveled, with, his, wife, the, painter, jacqueline, lamba, to, mexico, to, meet, trotsky, staying, as, the, guest, of, diego, rivera, s, former, wife, guadalupe, marin, and, there, he, met, frida, kahlo, and, saw, her, paintings, for, the, first, time, breton, declared, kahlo, to, be, an, innate, surrealist, painter, in, 1929, the, satellite, group, associated, with, the, journal, le, grand, jeu, including, roger, gilbert, lecomte, maurice, henry, and, the, czech, painter, josef, sima, was, ostracized, also, in, february, breton, asked, surrealists, to, assess, their, degree, of, moral, competence, and, theoretical, refinements, included, in, the, second, manifeste, du, surr, alisme, excluded, anyone, reluctant, to, commit, to, collective, action, a, list, which, included, leiris, limbour, morise, baron, queneau, pr, vert, desnos, masson, and, boiffard, excluded, members, launched, a, counterattack, sharply, criticizing, breton, in, the, pamphlet, un, cadavre, which, featured, a, picture, of, breton, wearing, a, crown, of, thorns, the, pamphlet, drew, upon, an, earlier, act, of, subversion, by, likening, breton, to, anatole, france, whose, unquestioned, value, breton, had, challenged, in, 1924, the, disunion, of, 1929, 30, and, the, effects, of, un, cadavre, had, very, little, negative, impact, upon, surrealism, as, breton, saw, it, since, core, figures, such, as, aragon, crevel, dal, and, bu, uel, remained, true, to, the, idea, of, group, action, at, least, for, the, time, being, the, success, or, the, controversy, of, dal, and, bu, uel, s, film, l, age, d, or, in, december, 1930, had, a, regenerative, effect, drawing, a, number, of, new, recruits, and, encouraging, countless, new, artistic, works, the, following, year, and, throughout, the, 1930s, disgruntled, surrealists, moved, to, the, periodical, documents, edited, by, georges, bataille, whose, anti, idealist, materialism, formed, a, hybrid, surrealism, intending, to, expose, the, base, instincts, of, humans, to, the, dismay, of, many, documents, fizzled, out, in, 1931, just, as, surrealism, seemed, to, be, gathering, more, steam, there, were, a, number, of, reconciliations, after, this, period, of, disunion, such, as, between, breton, and, bataille, while, aragon, left, the, group, after, committing, himself, to, the, french, communist, party, in, 1932, more, members, were, ousted, over, the, years, for, a, variety, of, infractions, both, political, and, personal, while, others, left, in, pursuit, of, their, own, style, by, the, end, of, world, war, ii, the, surrealist, group, led, by, andr, breton, decided, to, explicitly, embrace, anarchism, in, 1952, breton, wrote, it, was, in, the, black, mirror, of, anarchism, that, surrealism, first, recognised, itself, breton, was, consistent, in, his, support, for, the, francophone, anarchist, federation, and, he, continued, to, offer, his, solidarity, after, the, platformists, supporting, fontenis, transformed, the, fa, into, the, f, d, ration, communiste, libertaire, he, was, one, of, the, few, intellectuals, who, continued, to, offer, his, support, to, the, fcl, during, the, algerian, war, when, the, fcl, suffered, severe, repression, and, was, forced, underground, he, sheltered, fontenis, whilst, he, was, in, hiding, he, refused, to, take, sides, on, the, splits, in, the, french, anarchist, movement, and, both, he, and, peret, expressed, solidarity, as, well, with, the, new, f, d, ration, anarchiste, set, up, by, the, synthesist, anarchists, and, worked, in, the, antifascist, committees, of, the, 60s, alongside, the, fa, throughout, the, 1930s, surrealism, continued, to, become, more, visible, to, the, public, at, large, a, surrealist, group, developed, in, london, and, according, to, breton, their, 1936, london, international, surrealist, exhibition, was, a, high, water, mark, of, the, period, and, became, the, model, for, international, exhibitions, another, english, surrealist, group, developed, in, birmingham, meanwhile, and, was, distinguished, by, its, opposition, to, the, london, surrealists, and, preferences, for, surrealism, s, french, heartland, the, two, groups, would, reconcile, later, in, the, decade, dal, and, magritte, created, the, most, widely, recognized, images, of, the, movement, dal, joined, the, group, in, 1929, and, participated, in, the, rapid, establishment, of, the, visual, style, between, 1930, and, 1935, surrealism, as, a, visual, movement, had, found, a, method, to, expose, psychological, truth, stripping, ordinary, objects, of, their, normal, significance, to, create, a, compelling, image, that, was, beyond, ordinary, formal, organization, in, order, to, evoke, empathy, from, the, viewer, 1931, was, a, year, when, several, surrealist, painters, produced, works, which, marked, turning, points, in, their, stylistic, evolution, magritte, s, voice, of, space, la, voix, des, airs, is, an, example, of, this, process, where, three, large, spheres, representing, bells, hang, above, a, landscape, another, surrealist, landscape, from, this, same, year, is, yves, tanguy, s, promontory, palace, palais, promontoire, with, its, molten, forms, and, liquid, shapes, liquid, shapes, became, the, trademark, of, dal, particularly, in, his, the, persistence, of, memory, which, features, the, image, of, watches, that, sag, as, if, they, were, melting, the, characteristics, of, this, style, a, combination, of, the, depictive, the, abstract, and, the, psychological, came, to, stand, for, the, alienation, which, many, people, felt, in, the, modern, period, combined, with, the, sense, of, reaching, more, deeply, into, the, psyche, to, be, made, whole, with, one, s, individuality, between, 1930, and, 1933, the, surrealist, group, in, paris, issued, the, periodical, le, surr, alisme, au, service, de, la, r, volution, as, the, successor, of, la, r, volution, surr, aliste, from, 1936, through, 1938, wolfgang, paalen, gordon, onslow, ford, and, roberto, matta, joined, the, group, paalen, contributed, fumage, and, onslow, ford, coulage, as, new, pictorial, automatic, techniques, long, after, personal, political, and, professional, tensions, fragmented, the, surrealist, group, magritte, and, dal, continued, to, define, a, visual, program, in, the, arts, this, program, reached, beyond, painting, to, encompass, photography, as, well, as, can, be, seen, from, a, man, ray, self, portrait, whose, use, of, assemblage, influenced, robert, rauschenberg, s, collage, boxes, during, the, 1930s, peggy, guggenheim, an, important, american, art, collector, married, max, ernst, and, began, promoting, work, by, other, surrealists, such, as, yves, tanguy, and, the, british, artist, john, tunnard, major, exhibitions, in, the, 1930s, world, war, ii, created, havoc, not, only, for, the, general, population, of, europe, but, especially, for, the, european, artists, and, writers, that, opposed, fascism, and, nazism, many, important, artists, fled, to, north, america, and, relative, safety, in, the, united, states, the, art, community, in, new, york, city, in, particular, was, already, grappling, with, surrealist, ideas, and, several, artists, like, arshile, gorky, jackson, pollock, and, robert, motherwell, converged, closely, with, the, surrealist, artists, themselves, albeit, with, some, suspicion, and, reservations, ideas, concerning, the, unconscious, and, dream, imagery, were, quickly, embraced, by, the, second, world, war, the, taste, of, the, american, avant, garde, in, new, york, swung, decisively, towards, abstract, expressionism, with, the, support, of, key, taste, makers, including, peggy, guggenheim, leo, steinberg, and, clement, greenberg, however, it, should, not, be, easily, forgotten, that, abstract, expressionism, itself, grew, directly, out, of, the, meeting, of, american, particularly, new, york, artists, with, european, surrealists, self, exiled, during, world, war, ii, in, particular, gorky, and, paalen, influenced, the, development, of, this, american, art, form, which, as, surrealism, did, celebrated, the, instantaneous, human, act, as, the, well, spring, of, creativity, the, early, work, of, many, abstract, expressionists, reveals, a, tight, bond, between, the, more, superficial, aspects, of, both, movements, and, the, emergence, at, a, later, date, of, aspects, of, dadaistic, humor, in, such, artists, as, rauschenberg, sheds, an, even, starker, light, upon, the, connection, up, until, the, emergence, of, pop, art, surrealism, can, be, seen, to, have, been, the, single, most, important, influence, on, the, sudden, growth, in, american, arts, and, even, in, pop, some, of, the, humor, manifested, in, surrealism, can, be, found, often, turned, to, a, cultural, criticism, the, second, world, war, overshadowed, for, a, time, almost, all, intellectual, and, artistic, production, in, 1939, wolfgang, paalen, was, the, first, to, leave, paris, for, the, new, world, as, exile, after, a, long, trip, through, the, forests, of, british, columbia, he, settled, in, mexico, and, founded, his, influential, art, magazine, dyn, in, 1940, yves, tanguy, married, american, surrealist, painter, kay, sage, in, 1941, breton, went, to, the, united, states, where, he, co, founded, the, short, lived, magazine, vvv, with, max, ernst, marcel, duchamp, and, the, american, artist, david, hare, however, it, was, the, american, poet, charles, henri, ford, and, his, magazine, view, which, offered, breton, a, channel, for, promoting, surrealism, in, the, united, states, the, view, special, issue, on, duchamp, was, crucial, for, the, public, understanding, of, surrealism, in, america, it, stressed, his, connections, to, surrealist, methods, offered, interpretations, of, his, work, by, breton, as, well, as, breton, s, view, that, duchamp, represented, the, bridge, between, early, modern, movements, such, as, futurism, and, cubism, to, surrealism, wolfgang, paalen, left, the, group, in, 1942, due, to, political, philosophical, differences, with, breton, though, the, war, proved, disruptive, for, surrealism, the, works, continued, many, surrealist, artists, continued, to, explore, their, vocabularies, including, magritte, many, members, of, the, surrealist, movement, continued, to, correspond, and, meet, while, dal, may, have, been, excommunicated, by, breton, he, neither, abandoned, his, themes, from, the, 1930s, including, references, to, the, persistence, of, time, in, a, later, painting, nor, did, he, become, a, depictive, pompier, his, classic, period, did, not, represent, so, sharp, a, break, with, the, past, as, some, descriptions, of, his, work, might, portray, and, some, such, as, andr, thirion, argued, that, there, were, works, of, his, after, this, period, that, continued, to, have, some, relevance, for, the, movement, when, the, war, reached, ireland, with, the, belfast, blitz, in, may, 1941, colin, middleton, who, had, experimented, with, surrealist, themes, in, the, 1930s, responded, with, a, series, of, dark, works, reflecting, the, shocked, state, of, the, people, of, the, city, these, were, exhibited, at, the, belfast, municipal, gallery, and, museum, after, its, restoration, in, 1943, following, near, destruction, in, the, blitz, during, the, 1940s, surrealism, s, influence, was, also, felt, in, england, america, and, the, netherlands, where, gertrude, pape, and, her, husband, theo, van, baaren, helped, to, popularize, it, in, their, publication, the, clean, handkerchief, mark, rothko, took, an, interest, in, biomorphic, figures, and, in, england, henry, moore, lucian, freud, francis, bacon, and, paul, nash, used, or, experimented, with, surrealist, techniques, however, conroy, maddox, one, of, the, first, british, surrealists, whose, work, in, this, genre, dated, from, 1935, remained, within, the, movement, and, organized, an, exhibition, of, current, surrealist, work, in, 1978, in, response, to, an, earlier, show, which, infuriated, him, because, it, did, not, properly, represent, surrealism, maddox, s, exhibition, titled, surrealism, unlimited, was, held, in, paris, and, attracted, international, attention, he, held, his, last, one, man, show, in, 2002, and, died, three, years, later, magritte, s, work, became, more, realistic, in, its, depiction, of, actual, objects, while, maintaining, the, element, of, juxtaposition, such, as, in, 1951, s, personal, values, les, valeurs, personnelles, and, 1954, s, empire, of, light, l, empire, des, lumi, res, magritte, continued, to, produce, works, which, have, entered, artistic, vocabulary, such, as, castle, in, the, pyrenees, le, ch, teau, des, pyr, n, es, which, refers, back, to, voix, from, 1931, in, its, suspension, over, a, landscape, other, figures, from, the, surrealist, movement, were, expelled, several, of, these, artists, like, roberto, matta, by, his, own, description, remained, close, to, surrealism, frida, kahlo, should, be, mentioned, she, had, a, new, york, solo, exhibition, in, 1938, with, 25, paintings, encouraged, by, breton, himself, after, the, crushing, of, the, hungarian, revolution, of, 1956, endre, rozsda, returned, to, paris, to, continue, creating, his, own, word, that, had, been, transcended, the, surrealism, the, preface, to, his, first, exhibition, in, the, furstenberg, gallery, 1957, was, written, by, breton, yet, many, new, artists, explicitly, took, up, the, surrealist, banner, dorothea, tanning, and, louise, bourgeois, continued, to, work, for, example, with, tanning, s, rainy, day, canape, from, 1970, duchamp, continued, to, produce, sculpture, in, secret, including, an, installation, with, the, realistic, depiction, of, a, woman, viewable, only, through, a, peephole, breton, continued, to, write, and, espouse, the, importance, of, liberating, the, human, mind, as, with, the, publication, the, tower, of, light, in, 1952, breton, s, return, to, france, after, the, war, began, a, new, phase, of, surrealist, activity, in, paris, and, his, critiques, of, rationalism, and, dualism, found, a, new, audience, breton, insisted, that, surrealism, was, an, ongoing, revolt, against, the, reduction, of, humanity, to, market, relationships, religious, gestures, and, misery, and, to, espouse, the, importance, of, liberating, the, human, mind, major, exhibitions, of, the, 1940s, 50s, and, 60s, in, the, 1960s, the, artists, and, writers, associated, with, the, situationist, international, were, closely, associated, with, surrealism, while, guy, debord, was, critical, of, and, distanced, himself, from, surrealism, others, such, as, asger, jorn, were, explicitly, using, surrealist, techniques, and, methods, the, events, of, may, 1968, in, france, included, a, number, of, surrealist, ideas, and, among, the, slogans, the, students, spray, painted, on, the, walls, of, the, sorbonne, were, familiar, surrealist, ones, joan, mir, would, commemorate, this, in, a, painting, titled, may, 1968, there, were, also, groups, who, associated, with, both, currents, and, were, more, attached, to, surrealism, such, as, the, revolutionary, surrealist, group, during, the, 1980s, behind, the, iron, curtain, surrealism, again, entered, into, politics, with, an, underground, artistic, opposition, movement, known, as, the, orange, alternative, the, orange, alternative, was, created, in, 1981, by, waldemar, fydrych, alias, major, a, graduate, of, history, and, art, history, at, the, university, of, wroc, aw, they, used, surrealist, symbolism, and, terminology, in, their, large, scale, happenings, organized, in, the, major, polish, cities, during, the, jaruzelski, regime, and, painted, surrealist, graffiti, on, spots, covering, up, anti, regime, slogans, major, himself, was, the, author, of, a, manifesto, of, socialist, surrealism, in, this, manifesto, he, stated, that, the, socialist, communist, system, had, become, so, surrealistic, that, it, could, be, seen, as, an, expression, of, art, itself, surrealistic, art, also, remains, popular, with, museum, patrons, the, guggenheim, museum, in, new, york, city, held, an, exhibit, two, private, eyes, in, 1999, and, in, 2001, tate, modern,

associated, with, the, arts, it, has, impacted, many, other, fields, in, this, sense, surrealism, does, not, specifically, refer, only, to, self, identified, surrealists, or, those, sanctioned, by, breton, rather, it, refers, to, a, range, of, creative, acts, of, revolt, and, efforts, to, liberate, imagination, in, addition, to, surrealist, theory, being, grounded, in, the, ideas, of, hegel, marx, and, freud, to, its, advocates, its, inherent, dynamic, is, dialectical, thought, surrealist, artists, have, also, cited, the, alchemists, dante, hieronymus, bosch, the, marquis, de, sade, charles, fourier, comte, de, lautr, amont, and, arthur, rimbaud, as, influences, surrealists, believe, that, non, western, cultures, also, provide, a, continued, source, of, inspiration, for, surrealist, activity, because, some, may, induce, a, better, balance, between, instrumental, reason, and, imagination, in, flight, than, western, culture, surrealism, has, had, an, identifiable, impact, on, radical, and, revolutionary, politics, both, directly, as, in, some, surrealists, joining, or, allying, themselves, with, radical, political, groups, movements, and, parties, and, indirectly, through, the, way, in, which, surrealists, emphasize, the, intimate, link, between, freeing, imagination, and, the, mind, and, liberation, from, repressive, and, archaic, social, structures, this, was, especially, visible, in, the, new, left, of, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, and, the, french, revolt, of, may, 1968, whose, slogan, all, power, to, the, imagination, quoted, by, the,

definition, of, postmodernism, many, themes, and, techniques, commonly, identified, as, postmodern, are, nearly, identical, to, surrealism, first, papers, of, surrealism, presented, the, fathers, of, surrealism, in, an, exhibition, that, represented, the, leading, monumental, step, of, the, avant, gardes, towards, installation, art, many, writers, from, and, associated, with, the, beat, generation, were, influenced, greatly, by, surrealists, philip, lamantia, and, ted, joans, are, often, categorized, as, both, beat, and, surrealist, writers, many, other, beat, writers, show, significant, evidence, of, surrealist, influence, a, few, examples, include, bob, kaufman, gregory, corso, allen, ginsberg, and, lawrence, ferlinghetti, artaud, in, particular, was, very, influential,
