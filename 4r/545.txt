oil, painting, is, a, painting, method, involving, the, procedure, of, painting, with, pigments, with, a, medium, of, drying, oil, as, the, binder, it, has, been, the, most, common, technique, for, artistic, painting, on, canvas, wood, panel, or, copper, for, several, centuries, spreading, from, europe, to, the, rest, of, the, world, the, advantages, of, oil, for, painting, images, include, greater, flexibility, richer, and, denser, colour, the, use, of, layers, and, a, wider, range, from, light, to, dark, but, the, process, is, slower, especially, when, one, layer, of, paint, needs, to, be, allowed, to, dry, before, another, is, applied, the, oldest, known, oil, paintings, were, created, by, buddhist, artists, in, afghanistan, and, date, back, to, the, 7th, century, ad, oil, paint, was, used, by, europeans, for, painting, statues, and, woodwork, from, at, least, the, 12th, century, but, its, common, use, for, painted, images, began, with, early, netherlandish, painting, in, northern, europe, and, by, the, height, of, the, renaissance, oil, painting, techniques, had, almost, completely, replaced, the, use, of, egg, tempera, paints, for, panel, paintings, in, most, of, europe, though, not, for, orthodox, icons, or, wall, paintings, where, tempera, and, fresco, respectively, remained, the, usual, choice, commonly, used, drying, oils, include, linseed, oil, poppy, seed, oil, walnut, oil, and, safflower, oil, the, choice, of, oil, imparts, a, range, of, properties, to, the, paint, such, as, the, amount, of, yellowing, or, drying, time, the, paint, could, be, thinned, with, turpentine, certain, differences, depending, on, the, oil, are, also, visible, in, the, sheen, of, the, paints, an, artist, might, use, several, different, oils, in, the, same, painting, depending, on, specific, pigments, and, effects, desired, the, paints, themselves, also, develop, a, particular, consistency, depending, on, the, medium, the, oil, may, be, boiled, with, a, resin, such, as, pine, resin, or, frankincense, to, create, a, varnish, to, provide, protection, and, texture, the, paint, itself, can, be, moulded, into, different, textures, depending, on, its, plasticity, traditional, oil, painting, techniques, often, begin, with, the, artist, sketching, the, subject, onto, the, canvas, with, charcoal, or, thinned, paint, oil, paint, is, usually, mixed, with, linseed, oil, artist, grade, mineral, spirits, or, other, solvents, to, make, the, paint, thinner, faster, or, slower, drying, because, the, solvents, thin, the, oil, in, the, paint, they, can, also, be, used, to, clean, paint, brushes, a, basic, rule, of, oil, paint, application, is, fat, over, lean, meaning, that, each, additional, layer, of, paint, should, contain, more, oil, than, the, layer, below, to, allow, proper, drying, if, each, additional, layer, contains, less, oil, the, final, painting, will, crack, and, peel, the, consistency, on, the, canvas, depends, on, the, layering, of, the, oil, paint, this, rule, does, not, ensure, permanence, it, is, the, quality, and, type, of, oil, that, leads, to, a, strong, and, stable, paint, film, there, are, other, media, that, can, be, used, with, the, oil, including, cold, wax, resins, and, varnishes, these, additional, media, can, aid, the, painter, in, adjusting, the, translucency, of, the, paint, the, sheen, of, the, paint, the, density, or, body, of, the, paint, and, the, ability, of, the, paint, to, hold, or, conceal, the, brushstroke, these, aspects, of, the, paint, are, closely, related, to, the, expressive, capacity, of, oil, paint, traditionally, paint, was, most, often, transferred, to, the, painting, surface, using, paintbrushes, but, there, are, other, methods, including, using, palette, knives, and, rags, palette, knives, can, scrape, off, any, paint, from, a, canvas, and, can, also, be, used, for, application, oil, paint, remains, wet, longer, than, many, other, types, of, artists, materials, enabling, the, artist, to, change, the, color, texture, or, form, of, the, figure, at, times, the, painter, might, even, remove, an, entire, layer, of, paint, and, begin, anew, this, can, be, done, with, a, rag, and, some, turpentine, for, a, time, while, the, paint, is, wet, but, after, a, while, the, hardened, layer, must, be, scraped, off, oil, paint, dries, by, oxidation, not, evaporation, and, is, usually, dry, to, the, touch, within, a, span, of, two, weeks, some, colors, dry, within, days, the, earliest, known, surviving, oil, paintings, are, buddhist, murals, created, c, 650, ad, in, bamiyan, afghanistan, bamiyan, is, an, historic, settlement, along, the, silk, road, and, is, famous, for, the, bamiyan, buddhas, a, series, of, giant, statues, behind, which, rooms, and, tunnels, are, carved, from, the, rock, the, murals, are, located, in, these, rooms, the, artworks, display, a, wide, range, of, pigments, and, ingredients, and, even, included, the, use, of, a, final, varnish, layer, the, application, technique, and, refined, level, of, the, paint, media, used, in, the, murals, and, their, survival, into, the, present, day, suggests, that, oil, paints, had, been, used, in, asia, for, some, time, before, the, 7th, century, the, technique, used, of, binding, pigments, in, oil, was, unknown, in, europe, for, another, 900, years, or, so, in, northern, europe, practitioners, of, early, netherlandish, painting, developed, oil, painting, techniques, which, other, europeans, adopted, from, around, the, late, 15th, century, from, the, renaissance, on, oil, painting, technology, had, almost, completely, replaced, the, earlier, use, of, tempera, paints, in, the, majority, of, europe, most, european, renaissance, sources, in, particular, vasari, falsely, credit, northern, european, painters, of, the, 15th, century, and, jan, van, eyck, in, particular, with, the, invention, of, oil, paints, however, theophilus, presbyter, a, pseudonymous, author, who, is, sometimes, identified, as, roger, of, helmarshausen, clearly, gives, instructions, for, oil, based, painting, in, his, treatise, de, diversis, artibus, on, various, arts, written, about, 1125, at, this, period, it, was, probably, used, for, painting, sculptures, carvings, and, wood, fittings, perhaps, especially, for, outdoor, use, surfaces, exposed, to, the, weather, or, of, items, like, shields, both, those, used, in, tournaments, and, those, hung, as, decorations, were, more, durable, when, painted, in, oil, based, media, than, when, painted, in, the, traditional, tempera, paints, however, early, netherlandish, painting, with, artists, like, van, eyck, and, robert, campin, in, the, early, and, mid, 15th, century, were, the, first, to, make, oil, the, usual, painting, medium, and, explore, the, use, of, layers, and, glazes, followed, by, the, rest, of, northern, europe, and, then, italy, such, works, were, painted, on, wooden, panels, but, towards, the, end, of, the, 15th, century, canvas, began, to, be, used, as, a, support, as, it, was, cheaper, easier, to, transport, allowed, larger, works, and, did, not, require, complicated, preliminary, layers, of, gesso, a, fine, type, of, plaster, venice, where, sail, canvas, was, easily, available, was, a, leader, in, the, move, to, canvas, small, cabinet, paintings, were, also, made, on, metal, especially, copper, plates, these, supports, were, more, expensive, but, very, firm, allowing, intricately, fine, detail, often, printing, plates, from, printmaking, were, reused, for, this, purpose, the, increasing, use, of, oil, spread, through, italy, from, northern, europe, starting, in, venice, in, the, late, 15th, century, by, 1540, the, previous, method, for, painting, on, panel, tempera, had, become, all, but, extinct, although, italians, continued, to, use, chalk, based, fresco, for, wall, paintings, which, was, less, successful, and, durable, in, damper, northern, climates, renaissance, techniques, used, a, number, of, thin, almost, transparent, layers, or, glazes, usually, each, allowed, to, dry, before, the, next, was, added, greatly, increasing, the, time, a, painting, took, the, underpainting, or, ground, beneath, these, was, usually, white, typically, gesso, coated, with, a, primer, allowing, light, to, reflect, back, through, the, layers, but, van, eyck, and, robert, campin, a, little, later, used, a, wet, on, wet, technique, in, places, painting, a, second, layer, soon, after, the, first, initially, the, aim, was, as, with, the, established, techniques, of, tempera, and, fresco, to, produce, a, smooth, surface, when, no, attention, was, drawn, to, the, brushstrokes, or, texture, of, the, painted, surface, among, the, earliest, impasto, effects, using, a, raised, or, rough, texture, in, the, surface, of, the, paint, are, those, from, the, later, works, of, the, venetian, painter, giovanni, bellini, around, 1500, this, became, much, more, common, in, the, 16th, century, as, may, painters, began, to, draw, attention, to, the, process, of, their, painting, by, leaving, individual, brushstrokes, obvious, and, a, rough, painted, surface, another, venetian, titian, was, a, leader, in, this, in, the, 17th, century, some, artists, including, rembrandt, began, to, use, dark, grounds, until, the, mid, 19th, century, there, was, a, division, between, artists, who, exploited, effects, of, handling, in, their, paintwork, and, those, who, continued, to, aim, at, an, even, glassy, surface, from, which, all, evidences, of, manipulation, had, been, banished, before, the, 19th, century, artists, or, their, apprentices, ground, pigments, and, mixed, their, paints, for, the, range, of, painting, media, this, made, portability, difficult, and, kept, most, painting, activities, confined, to, the, studio, this, changed, when, tubes, of, oil, paint, became, widely, available, following, the, american, portrait, painter, john, goffe, rand, s, invention, of, the, squeezable, or, collapsible, metal, tube, in, 1841, artists, could, mix, colors, quickly, and, easily, which, enabled, for, the, first, time, relatively, convenient, plein, air, painting, a, common, approach, in, french, impressionism, the, linseed, oil, itself, comes, from, the, flax, seed, a, common, fiber, crop, linen, a, support, for, oil, painting, see, relevant, section, also, comes, from, the, flax, plant, safflower, oil, or, the, walnut, or, poppyseed, oil, or, castor, oil, are, sometimes, used, in, formulating, lighter, colors, like, white, because, they, yellow, less, on, drying, than, linseed, oil, but, they, have, the, slight, drawback, of, drying, more, slowly, and, may, not, provide, the, strongest, paint, film, linseed, oil, tends, to, dry, yellow, and, can, change, the, hue, of, the, color, in, some, regions, this, technique, is, referred, to, as, the, drying, oil, technique, recent, advances, in, chemistry, have, produced, modern, water, miscible, oil, paints, that, can, be, used, and, cleaned, up, with, water, small, alterations, in, the, molecular, structure, of, the, oil, creates, this, water, miscible, property, the, earliest, oil, paintings, were, almost, all, panel, paintings, on, wood, which, had, been, seasoned, and, prepared, in, a, complicated, and, rather, expensive, process, with, the, panel, constructed, from, several, pieces, of, wood, although, such, a, support, has, a, tendency, to, warp, panels, continued, to, be, used, well, into, the, 17th, century, including, by, rubens, who, painted, several, large, works, on, wood, the, artists, of, the, italian, regions, moved, towards, canvas, in, the, early, 16th, century, led, partly, by, a, wish, to, paint, larger, images, which, would, have, been, too, heavy, as, panels, canvas, for, sails, was, made, in, venice, and, so, easily, available, and, cheaper, than, wood, smaller, paintings, with, very, fine, detail, were, easier, to, paint, on, a, very, firm, surface, and, wood, panels, or, copper, plates, often, reused, from, printmaking, were, often, chosen, for, small, cabinet, paintings, even, in, the, 19th, century, portrait, miniatures, normally, used, very, firm, supports, including, ivory, or, stiff, paper, card, traditional, artists, canvas, is, made, from, linen, but, less, expensive, cotton, fabric, has, been, used, the, artist, first, prepares, a, wooden, frame, called, a, stretcher, or, strainer, the, difference, between, the, two, names, is, that, stretchers, are, slightly, adjustable, while, strainers, are, rigid, and, lack, adjustable, corner, notches, the, canvas, is, then, pulled, across, the, wooden, frame, and, tacked, or, stapled, tightly, to, the, back, edge, then, the, artist, applies, a, size, to, isolate, the, canvas, from, the, acidic, qualities, of, the, paint, traditionally, the, canvas, was, coated, with, a, layer, of, animal, glue, modern, painters, will, use, rabbit, skin, glue, as, the, size, and, primed, with, lead, white, paint, sometimes, with, added, chalk, panels, were, prepared, with, a, gesso, a, mixture, of, glue, and, chalk, modern, acrylic, gesso, is, made, of, titanium, dioxide, with, an, acrylic, binder, it, is, frequently, used, on, canvas, whereas, real, gesso, is, not, suitable, for, canvas, the, artist, might, apply, several, layers, of, gesso, sanding, each, smooth, after, it, has, dried, acrylic, gesso, is, very, difficult, to, sand, one, manufacturer, makes, a, sandable, acrylic, gesso, but, it, is, intended, for, panels, only, and, not, canvas, it, is, possible, to, make, the, gesso, a, particular, color, but, most, store, bought, gesso, is, white, the, gesso, layer, depending, on, its, thickness, will, tend, to, draw, the, oil, paint, into, the, porous, surface, excessive, or, uneven, gesso, layers, are, sometimes, visible, in, the, surface, of, finished, paintings, as, a, change, that, s, not, from, the, paint, standard, sizes, for, oil, paintings, were, set, in, france, in, the, 19th, century, the, standards, were, used, by, most, artists, not, only, the, french, as, it, was, and, evidently, still, is, supported, by, the, main, suppliers, of, artists, materials, size, 0, toile, de, 0, to, size, 120, toile, de, 120, is, divided, in, separate, runs, for, figures, figure, landscapes, paysage, and, marines, marine, that, more, or, less, preserve, the, diagonal, thus, a, 0, figure, corresponds, in, height, with, a, paysage, 1, and, a, marine, 2, although, surfaces, like, linoleum, wooden, panel, paper, slate, pressed, wood, masonite, and, cardboard, have, been, used, the, most, popular, surface, since, the, 16th, century, has, been, canvas, although, many, artists, used, panel, through, the, 17th, century, and, beyond, panel, is, more, expensive, heavier, harder, to, transport, and, prone, to, warp, or, split, in, poor, conditions, for, fine, detail, however, the, absolute, solidity, of, a, wooden, panel, has, an, advantage, oil, paint, is, made, by, mixing, pigments, of, colors, with, an, oil, medium, since, the, 19th, century, the, different, main, colors, are, purchased, in, paint, tubes, pre, prepared, before, painting, begins, further, shades, of, color, are, usually, obtained, by, mixing, small, quantities, together, as, the, painting, process, is, underway, an, artist, s, palette, traditionally, a, thin, wood, board, held, in, the, hand, is, used, for, holding, and, mixing, paints, pigments, may, be, any, number, of, natural, or, synthetic, substances, with, color, such, as, sulphides, for, yellow, or, cobalt, salts, for, blue, traditional, pigments, were, based, on, minerals, or, plants, but, many, have, proven, unstable, over, long, periods, of, time, modern, pigments, often, use, synthetic, chemicals, the, pigment, is, mixed, with, oil, usually, linseed, but, other, oils, may, be, used, the, various, oils, dry, differently, which, creates, assorted, effects, a, brush, is, most, commonly, employed, by, the, artist, to, apply, the, paint, often, over, a, sketched, outline, of, their, subject, which, could, be, in, another, medium, brushes, are, made, from, a, variety, of, fibers, to, create, different, effects, for, example, brushes, made, with, hog, bristle, might, be, used, for, bolder, strokes, and, impasto, textures, fitch, hair, and, mongoose, hair, brushes, are, fine, and, smooth, and, thus, answer, well, for, portraits, and, detail, work, even, more, expensive, are, red, sable, brushes, weasel, hair, the, finest, quality, brushes, are, called, kolinsky, sable, these, brush, fibers, are, taken, from, the, tail, of, the, siberian, weasel, this, hair, keeps, a, superfine, point, has, smooth, handling, and, good, memory, it, returns, to, its, original, point, when, lifted, off, the, canvas, known, to, artists, as, a, brush, s, snap, floppy, fibers, with, no, snap, such, as, squirrel, hair, are, generally, not, used, by, oil, painters, in, the, past, few, decades, many, synthetic, brushes, have, been, marketed, these, are, very, durable, and, can, be, quite, good, as, well, as, cost, efficient, brushes, come, in, multiple, sizes, and, are, used, for, different, purposes, the, type, of, brush, also, makes, a, difference, for, example, a, round, is, a, pointed, brush, used, for, detail, work, flat, brushes, are, used, to, apply, broad, swaths, of, color, bright, is, a, flat, brush, with, shorter, brush, hairs, used, for, scrubbing, in, filbert, is, a, flat, brush, with, rounded, corners, egbert, is, a, very, long, and, rare, filbert, brush, the, artist, might, also, apply, paint, with, a, palette, knife, which, is, a, flat, metal, blade, a, palette, knife, may, also, be, used, to, remove, paint, from, the, canvas, when, necessary, a, variety, of, unconventional, tools, such, as, rags, sponges, and, cotton, swabs, may, be, used, to, apply, or, remove, paint, some, artists, even, paint, with, their, fingers, old, masters, usually, applied, paint, in, thin, layers, known, as, glazes, that, allow, light, to, penetrate, completely, through, the, layer, a, method, also, simply, called, indirect, painting, this, technique, is, what, gives, oil, paintings, their, luminous, characteristics, this, method, was, first, perfected, through, an, adaptation, of, the, egg, tempera, painting, technique, egg, yolks, used, as, a, binder, mixed, with, pigment, and, was, applied, by, the, early, netherlandish, painters, in, northern, europe, with, pigments, usually, ground, in, linseed, oil, this, approach, has, been, called, the, mixed, technique, or, mixed, method, in, modern, times, the, first, coat, the, underpainting, is, laid, down, often, painted, with, egg, tempera, or, turpentine, thinned, paint, this, layer, helps, to, tone, the, canvas, and, to, cover, the, white, of, the, gesso, many, artists, use, this, layer, to, sketch, out, the, composition, this, first, layer, can, be, adjusted, before, proceeding, further, an, advantage, over, the, cartooning, method, used, in, fresco, technique, after, this, layer, dries, the, artist, might, then, proceed, by, painting, a, mosaic, of, color, swatches, working, from, darkest, to, lightest, the, borders, of, the, colors, are, blended, together, when, the, mosaic, is, completed, and, then, left, to, dry, before, applying, details, artists, in, later, periods, such, as, the, impressionist, era, late, 19th, century, often, expanded, on, this, wet, on, wet, method, blending, the, wet, paint, on, the, canvas, without, following, the, renaissance, era, approach, of, layering, and, glazing, this, method, is, also, called, alla, prima, this, method, was, created, due, to, the, advent, of, painting, outdoors, instead, of, inside, a, studio, because, while, outside, an, artist, did, not, have, the, time, to, let, each, layer, of, paint, dry, before, adding, a, new, layer, several, contemporary, artists, use, a, combination, of, both, techniques, to, add, bold, color, wet, on, wet, and, obtain, the, depth, of, layers, through, glazing, when, the, image, is, finished, and, has, dried, for, up, to, a, year, an, artist, often, seals, the, work, with, a, layer, of, varnish, that, is, typically, made, from, dammar, gum, crystals, dissolved, in, turpentine, such, varnishes, can, be, removed, without, disturbing, the, oil, painting, itself, to, enable, cleaning, and, conservation, some, contemporary, artists, decide, not, to, varnish, their, work, preferring, the, surface, unvarnished, to, avoid, a, glossy, look
