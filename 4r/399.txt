heavy, metal, or, simply, metal, is, a, genre, of, rock, music, that, developed, in, the, late, 1960s, and, early, 1970s, largely, in, the, united, kingdom, and, united, states, with, roots, in, blues, rock, psychedelic, rock, and, acid, rock, heavy, metal, bands, developed, a, thick, monumental, sound, characterized, by, distorted, guitars, extended, guitar, solos, emphatic, beats, and, loudness, in, 1968, three, of, the, genre, s, most, famous, pioneers, british, bands, led, zeppelin, black, sabbath, and, deep, purple, were, founded, though, they, came, to, attract, wide, audiences, they, were, often, derided, by, critics, several, american, bands, modified, heavy, metal, into, more, accessible, forms, during, the, 1970s, the, raw, sleazy, sound, and, shock, rock, of, alice, cooper, and, kiss, the, blues, rooted, rock, of, aerosmith, and, the, flashy, guitar, leads, and, party, rock, of, van, halen, during, the, mid, 1970s, judas, priest, helped, spur, the, genre, s, evolution, by, discarding, much, of, its, blues, influence, while, mot, rhead, introduced, a, punk, rock, sensibility, and, an, increasing, emphasis, on, speed, beginning, in, the, late, 1970s, bands, in, the, new, wave, of, british, heavy, metal, such, as, iron, maiden, and, saxon, followed, in, a, similar, vein, by, the, end, of, the, decade, heavy, metal, fans, became, known, as, metalheads, or, headbangers, the, lyrics, of, some, metal, genres, became, associated, with, aggression, and, machismo, an, issue, that, has, at, times, led, to, accusations, of, misogyny, during, the, 1980s, glam, metal, became, popular, with, groups, such, as, bon, jovi, m, tley, cr, e, and, poison, meanwhile, however, underground, scenes, produced, an, array, of, more, aggressive, styles, thrash, metal, broke, into, the, mainstream, with, bands, such, as, metallica, slayer, megadeth, and, anthrax, while, other, extreme, subgenres, such, as, death, metal, and, black, metal, became, and, remain, subcultural, phenomena, since, the, mid, 1990s, popular, styles, have, expanded, the, definition, of, the, genre, these, include, groove, metal, and, nu, metal, the, latter, of, which, often, incorporates, elements, of, grunge, and, hip, hop, heavy, metal, is, traditionally, characterized, by, loud, distorted, guitars, emphatic, rhythms, dense, bass, and, drum, sound, and, vigorous, vocals, heavy, metal, subgenres, variously, emphasize, alter, or, omit, one, or, more, of, these, attributes, in, a, 1988, article, the, new, york, times, critic, jon, pareles, wrote, in, the, taxonomy, of, popular, music, heavy, metal, is, a, major, subspecies, of, hard, rock, the, breed, with, less, syncopation, less, blues, more, showmanship, and, more, brute, force, the, typical, band, lineup, includes, a, drummer, a, bassist, a, rhythm, guitarist, a, lead, guitarist, and, a, singer, who, may, or, may, not, be, an, instrumentalist, keyboard, instruments, are, sometimes, used, to,

1990s, synthesizers, were, used, in, almost, every, subgenre, of, heavy, metal, the, electric, guitar, and, the, sonic, power, that, it, projects, through, amplification, has, historically, been, the, key, element, in, heavy, metal, the, heavy, metal, guitar, sound, comes, from, a, combined, use, of, high, volumes, and, heavy, fuzz, for, classic, heavy, metal, guitar, tone, guitarists, maintain,

element, of, the, heavy, metal, code, that, underscores, the, significance, of, the, guitar, to, the, genre, most, heavy, metal, songs, feature, at, least, one, guitar, solo, which, is, a, primary, means, through, which, the, heavy, metal, performer, expresses, virtuosity, some, exceptions, are, nu, metal, and, grindcore, bands, which, tend, to, omit, guitar, solos, with, rhythm, guitar, parts, the, heavy, crunch, sound, in, heavy, metal, palm, muting, the, strings, with, the, picking, hand, and, using, distortion, palm, muting, creates, a, tighter, more, precise, sound, and, it, emphasizes, the, low, end, the, lead, role, of, the, guitar, in, heavy, metal, often, collides, with, the, traditional, frontman, or, bandleader, role, of, the, vocalist, creating, a, musical, tension, as, the, two, contend, for, dominance, in, a, spirit, of, affectionate, rivalry, heavy, metal, demands, the, subordination, of, the, voice, to, the, overall, sound, of, the, band, reflecting, metal, s, roots, in, the, 1960s, counterculture, an, explicit, display, of, emotion, is, required, from, the, vocals, as, a, sign, of, authenticity, critic, simon, frith, claims, that, the, metal, singer, s, tone, of, voice, is, more, important, than, the, lyrics, the, prominent, role, of, the, bass, is, also, key, to, the, metal, sound, and, the, interplay, of, bass, and, guitar, is, a, central, element, the, bass, provides, the, low, end, sound, crucial, to, making, the, music, heavy, the, bass, plays, a, more, important, role, in, heavy, metal, than, in, any, other, genre, of, rock, metal, basslines, vary, widely, in, complexity, from, holding, down, a, low, pedal, point, as, a, foundation, to, doubling, complex, riffs, and, licks, along, with, the, lead, or, rhythm, guitars, some, bands, feature, the, bass, as, a, lead, instrument, an, approach, popularized, by, metallica, s, cliff, burton, with, his, heavy, emphasis, on, bass, solos, and, use, of, chords, while, playing, the, bass, in, the, early, 1980s, lemmy, of, mot, rhead, often, played, overdriven, power, chords, in, his, bass, lines, the, essence, of, heavy, metal, drumming, is, creating, a, loud, constant, beat, for, the, band, using, the, trifecta, of, speed, power, and, precision, heavy, metal, drumming, requires, an, exceptional, amount, of, endurance, and, drummers, have, to, develop, considerable, speed, coordination, and, dexterity, to, play, the, intricate, patterns, used, in, heavy, metal, a, characteristic, metal, drumming, technique, is, the, cymbal, choke, which, consists, of, striking, a, cymbal, and, then, immediately, silencing, it, by, grabbing, it, with, the, other, hand, or, in, some, cases, the, same, striking, hand, producing, a, burst, of, sound, the, metal, drum, setup, is, generally, much, larger, than, those, employed, in, other, forms, of, rock, music, black, metal, death, metal, and, some, mainstream, metal, bands, all, depend, upon, double, kicks, and, blast, beats, in, live, performance, loudness, an, onslaught, of, sound, in, sociologist, deena, weinstein, s, description, is, considered, vital, in, his, book, metalheads, psychologist, jeffrey, arnett, refers, to, heavy, metal, concerts, as, the, sensory, equivalent, of, war, following, the, lead, set, by, jimi, hendrix, cream, and, the, who, early, heavy, metal, acts, such, as, blue, cheer, set, new, benchmarks, for, volume, as, blue, cheer, s, dick, peterson, put, it, all, we, knew, was, we, wanted, more, power, a, 1977, review, of, a, mot, rhead, concert, noted, how, excessive, volume, in, particular, figured, into, the, band, s, impact, weinstein, makes, the, case, that, in, the, same, way, that, melody, is, the, main, element, of, pop, and, rhythm, is, the, main, focus, of, house, music, powerful, sound, timbre, and, volume, are, the, key, elements, of, metal, she, argues, that, the, loudness, is, designed, to, sweep, the, listener, into, the, sound, and, to, provide, a, shot, of, youthful, vitality, heavy, metal, performers, tended, to, be, almost, exclusively, male, until, at, least, the, mid, 1980s, with, some, exceptions, such, as, girlschool, however, by, the, 2010s, women, were, making, more, of, an, impact, and, popmatters, craig, hayes, argues, that, metal, clearly, empowers, women, in, the, power, metal, and, symphonic, metal, subgenres, there, has, been, a, sizable, number, of, bands, that, have, had, women, as, the, lead, singers, such, as, nightwish, delain, and, within, temptation, the, rhythm, in, metal, songs, is, emphatic, with, deliberate, stresses, weinstein, observes, that, the, wide, array, of, sonic, effects, available, to, metal, drummers, enables, the, rhythmic, pattern, to, take, on, a, complexity, within, its, elemental, drive, and, insistency, in, many, heavy, metal, songs, the, main, groove, is, characterized, by, short, two, or, three, note, rhythmic, figures, generally, made, up, of, eighth, or, 16th, notes, these, rhythmic, figures, are, usually, performed, with, a, staccato, attack, created, by, using, a, palm, muted, technique, on, the, rhythm, guitar, brief, abrupt, and, detached, rhythmic, cells, are, joined, into, rhythmic, phrases, with, a, distinctive, often, jerky, texture, these, phrases, are, used, to, create, rhythmic, accompaniment, and, melodic, figures, called, riffs, which, help, to, establish, thematic, hooks, heavy, metal, songs, also, use, longer, rhythmic, figures, such, as, whole, note, or, dotted, quarter, note, length, chords, in, slow, tempo, power, ballads, the, tempos, in, early, heavy, metal, music, tended, to, be, slow, even, ponderous, by, the, late, 1970s, however, metal, bands, were, employing, a, wide, variety, of, tempos, and, as, recently, as, the, 2000s, metal, tempos, range, from, slow, ballad, tempos, quarter, note, 60, beats, per, minute, to, extremely, fast, blast, beat, tempos, quarter, note, 350, beats, per, minute, one, of, the, signatures, of, the, genre, is, the, guitar, power, chord, in, technical, terms, the, power, chord, is, relatively, simple, it, involves, just, one, main, interval, generally, the, perfect, fifth, though, an, octave, may, be, added, as, a, doubling, of, the, root, when, power, chords, are, played, on, the, lower, strings, at, high, volumes, and, with, distortion, additional, low, frequency, sounds, are, created, which, add, to, the, weight, of, the, sound, and, create, an, effect, of, overwhelming, power, although, the, perfect, fifth, interval, is, the, most, common, basis, for, the, power, chord, power, chords, are, also, based, on, different, intervals, such, as, the, minor, third, major, third, perfect, fourth, diminished, fifth, or, minor, sixth, most, power, chords, are, also, played, with, a, consistent, finger, arrangement, that, can, be, slid, easily, up, and, down, the, fretboard, heavy, metal, is, usually, based, on, riffs, created, with, three, main, harmonic, traits, modal, scale, progressions, tritone, and, chromatic, progressions, and, the, use, of, pedal, points, traditional, heavy, metal, tends, to, employ, modal, scales, in, particular, the, aeolian, and, phrygian, modes, harmonically, speaking, this, means, the, genre, typically, incorporates, modal, chord, progressions, such, as, the, aeolian, progressions, i, vi, vii, i, vii, vi, or, i, vi, iv, vii, and, phrygian, progressions, implying, the, relation, between, i, and, ii, i, ii, i, i, ii, iii, or, i, ii, vii, for, example, tense, sounding, chromatic, or, tritone, relationships, are, used, in, a, number, of, metal, chord, progressions, in, addition, to, using, modal, harmonic, relationships, heavy, metal, also, uses, pentatonic, and, blues, derived, features, the, tritone, an, interval, spanning, three, whole, tones, such, as, c, to, f, was, considered, extremely, dissonant, and, unstable, by, medieval, and, renaissance, music, theorists, it, was, nicknamed, the, diabolus, in, musica, the, devil, in, music, heavy, metal, songs, often, make, extensive, use, of, pedal, point, as, a, harmonic, basis, a, pedal, point, is, a, sustained, tone, typically, in, the, bass, range, during, which, at, least, one, foreign, i, e, dissonant, harmony, is, sounded, in, the, other, parts, according, to, robert, walser, heavy, metal, harmonic, relationships, are, often, quite, complex, and, the, harmonic, analysis, done, by, metal, players, and, teachers, is, often, very, sophisticated, in, the, study, of, heavy, metal, chord, structures, it, has, been, concluded, that, heavy, metal, music, has, proved, to, be, far, more, complicated, than, other, music, researchers, had, realized, robert, walser, stated, that, alongside, blues, and, r, b, the, assemblage, of, disparate, musical, styles, known, as, classical, music, has, been, a, major, influence, on, heavy, metal, since, the, genre, s, earliest, days, and, that, metal, s, most, influential, musicians, have, been, guitar, players, who, have, also, studied, classical, music, their, appropriation, and, adaptation, of, classical, models, sparked, the, development, of, a, new, kind, of, guitar, virtuosity, changes, in, the, harmonic, and, melodic, language, of, heavy, metal, in, an, article, written, for, grove, music, online, walser, stated, that, the, 1980s, brought, on, the, widespread, adaptation, of, chord, progressions, and, virtuosic, practices, from, 18th, century, european, models, especially, bach, and, antonio, vivaldi, by, influential, guitarists, such, as, ritchie, blackmore, marty, friedman, jason, becker, uli, jon, roth, eddie, van, halen, randy, rhoads, and, yngwie, malmsteen, kurt, bachmann, of, believer, has, stated, that, if, done, correctly, metal, and, classical, fit, quite, well, together, classical, and, metal, are, probably, the, two, genres, that, have, the, most, in, common, when, it, comes, to, feel, texture, creativity, although, a, number, of, metal, musicians, cite, classical, composers, as, inspiration, classical, and, metal, are, rooted, in, different, cultural, traditions, and, practices, classical, in, the, art, music, tradition, metal, in, the, popular, music, tradition, as, musicologists, nicolas, cook, and, nicola, dibben, note, analyses, of, popular, music, also, sometimes, reveal, the, influence, of, art, traditions, an, example, is, walser, s, linkage, of, heavy, metal, music, with, the, ideologies, and, even, some, of, the, performance, practices, of, nineteenth, century, romanticism, however, it, would, be, clearly, wrong, to, claim, that, traditions, such, as, blues, rock, heavy, metal, rap, or, dance, music, derive, primarily, from, art, music, according, to, david, hatch, and, stephen, millward, black, sabbath, and, the, numerous, heavy, metal, bands, that, they, inspired, have, concentrated, lyrically, on, dark, and, depressing, subject, matter, to, an, extent, hitherto, unprecedented, in, any, form, of, pop, music, they, take, as, an, example, black, sabbath, s, second, album, paranoid, 1970, which, included, songs, dealing, with, personal, trauma, paranoid, and, fairies, wear, boots, which, described, the, unsavoury, side, effects, of, drug, taking, as, well, as, those, confronting, wider, issues, such, as, the, self, explanatory, war, pigs, and, hand, of, doom, deriving, from, the, genre, s, roots, in, blues, music, sex, is, another, important, topic, a, thread, running, from, led, zeppelin, s, suggestive, lyrics, to, the, more, explicit, references, of, glam, metal, and, nu, metal, bands, the, thematic, content, of, heavy, metal, has, long, been, a, target, of, criticism, according, to, jon, pareles, heavy, metal, s, main, subject, matter, is, simple, and, virtually, universal, with, grunts, moans, and, subliterary, lyrics, it, celebrates, a, party, without, limits, he, bulk, of, the, music, is, stylized, and, formulaic, music, critics, have, often, deemed, metal, lyrics, juvenile, and, banal, and, others, have, objected, to, what, they, see, as, advocacy, of, misogyny, and, the, occult, during, the, 1980s, the, parents, music, resource, center, petitioned, the, u, s, congress, to, regulate, the, popular, music, industry, due, to, what, the, group, asserted, were, objectionable, lyrics, particularly, those, in, heavy, metal, songs, andrew, cope, stated, that, claims, that, heavy, metal, lyrics, are, misogynistic, are, clearly, misguided, as, these, critics, have, overlook, the, overwhelming, evidence, that, suggests, otherwise, music, critic, robert, christgau, called, metal, an, expressive, mode, it, sometimes, seems, will, be, with, us, for, as, long, as, ordinary, white, boys, fear, girls, pity, themselves, and, are, permitted, to, rage, against, a, world, they, ll, never, beat, heavy, metal, artists, have, had, to, defend, their, lyrics, in, front, of, the, u, s, senate, and, in, court, in, 1985, twisted, sister, frontman, dee, snider, was, asked, to, defend, his, song, under, the, blade, at, a, u, s, senate, hearing, at, the, hearing, the, pmrc, alleged, that, the, song, was, about, sadomasochism, and, rape, snider, stated, that, the, song, was, about, his, bandmate, s, throat, surgery, in, 1986, ozzy, osbourne, was, sued, over, the, lyrics, of, his, song, suicide, solution, a, lawsuit, against, osbourne, was, filed, by, the, parents, of, john, mccollum, a, depressed, teenager, who, committed, suicide, allegedly, after, listening, to, osbourne, s, song, osbourne, was, not, found, to, be, responsible, for, the, teen, s, death, in, 1990, judas, priest, was, sued, in, american, court, by, the, parents, of, two, young, men, who, had, shot, themselves, five, years, earlier, allegedly, after, hearing, the, subliminal, statement, do, it, in, the, band, s, cover, of, the, song, better, by, you, better, than, me, while, the, case, attracted, a, great, deal, of, media, attention, it, was, ultimately, dismissed, in, 1991, u, k, police, seized, death, metal, records, from, the, british, record, label, earache, records, in, an, unsuccessful, attempt, to, prosecute, the, label, for, obscenity, in, some, predominantly, muslim, countries, heavy, metal, has, been, officially, denounced, as, a, threat, to, traditional, values, and, in, countries, such, as, morocco, egypt, lebanon, and, malaysia, there, have, been, incidents, of, heavy, metal, musicians, and, fans, being, arrested, and, incarcerated, in, 1997, the, egyptian, police, jailed, many, young, metal, fans, and, they, were, accused, of, devil, worship, and, blasphemy, after, police, found, metal, recordings, during, searches, of, their, homes, in, 2013, malaysia, banned, lamb, of, god, from, performing, in, their, country, on, the, grounds, that, the, band, s, lyrics, could, be, interpreted, as, being, religiously, insensitive, and, blasphemous, some, people, consider, heavy, metal, music, to, be, a, leading, factor, for, mental, health, disorders, and, that, heavy, metal, fans, are, more, likely, to, suffer, poor, mental, health, but, a, study, from, 2009, suggests, that, this, is, not, true, and, that, fans, of, heavy, metal, music, suffer, from, poor, mental, health, at, a, similar, or, lower, rate, compared, to, the, general, population, for, many, artists, and, bands, visual, imagery, plays, a, large, role, in, heavy, metal, in, addition, to, its, sound, and, lyrics, a, heavy, metal, band, s, image, is, expressed, in, album, cover, art, logos, stage, sets, clothing, design, of, instruments, and, music, videos, down, the, back, long, hair, is, the, most, crucial, distinguishing, feature, of, metal, fashion, originally, adopted, from, the, hippie, subculture, by, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, heavy, metal, hair, symbolised, the, hate, angst, and, disenchantment, of, a, generation, that, seemingly, never, felt, at, home, according, to, journalist, nader, rahman, long, hair, gave, members, of, the, metal, community, the, power, they, needed, to, rebel, against, nothing, in, general, the, classic, uniform, of, heavy, metal, fans, consists, of, light, colored, ripped, frayed, or, torn, blue, jeans, black, t, shirts, boots, and, black, leather, or, denim, jackets, deena, weinstein, wrote, t, shirts, are, generally, emblazoned, with, the, logos, or, other, visual, representations, of, favorite, metal, bands, in, the, 1980s, a, range, of, sources, from, punk, rock, and, goth, music, to, horror, films, influenced, metal, fashion, many, metal, performers, of, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, used, radically, shaped, and, brightly, colored, instruments, to, enhance, their, stage, appearance, fashion, and, personal, style, was, especially, important, for, glam, metal, bands, of, the, era, performers, typically, wore, long, dyed, hairspray, teased, hair, hence, the, nickname, hair, metal, makeup, such, as, lipstick, and, eyeliner, gaudy, clothing, including, leopard, skin, printed, shirts, or, vests, and, tight, denim, leather, or, spandex, pants, and, accessories, such, as, headbands, and, jewelry, pioneered, by, the, heavy, metal, act, x, japan, in, the, late, 1980s, bands, in, the, japanese, movement, known, as, visual, kei, which, includes, many, non, metal, groups, emphasize, elaborate, costumes, hair, and, makeup, when, performing, live, many, metal, musicians, as, well, as, the, audience, for, whom, they, re, playing, engage, in, headbanging, which, involves, rhythmically, beating, time, with, the, head, often, emphasized, by, long, hair, the, il, cornuto, or, devil, horns, hand, gesture, was, popularized, by, vocalist, ronnie, james, dio, during, his, time, with, the, bands, black, sabbath, and, dio, although, gene, simmons, of, kiss, claims, to, have, been, the, first, to, make, the, gesture, on, the, 1977, love, gun, album, cover, there, is, speculation, as, to, who, started, the, phenomenon, attendees, of, metal, concerts, do, not, dance, in, the, usual, sense, it, has, been, argued, that, this, is, due, to, the, music, s, largely, male, audience, and, extreme, heterosexualist, ideology, two, primary, body, movements, used, are, headbanging, and, an, arm, thrust, that, is, both, a, sign, of, appreciation, and, a, rhythmic, gesture, the, performance, of, air, guitar, is, popular, among, metal, fans, both, at, concerts, and, listening, to, records, at, home, according, to, deena, weinstein, thrash, metal, concerts, have, two, elements, that, are, not, part, of, the, other, metal, genres, moshing, and, stage, diving, which, were, imported, from, the, punk, hardcore, subculture, weinstein, states, that, moshing, participants, bump, and, jostle, each, other, as, they, move, in, a, circle, in, an, area, called, the, pit, near, the, stage, stage, divers, climb, onto, the, stage, with, the, band, and, then, jump, back, into, the, audience, it, has, been, argued, that, heavy, metal, has, outlasted, many, other, rock, genres, largely, due, to, the, emergence, of, an, intense, exclusionary, and, strongly, masculine, subculture, while, the, metal, fan, base, is, largely, young, white, male, and, blue, collar, the, group, is, tolerant, of, those, outside, its, core, demographic, base, who, follow, its, codes, of, dress, appearance, and, behavior, identification, with, the, subculture, is, strengthened, not, only, by, the, group, experience, of, concert, going, and, shared, elements, of, fashion, but, also, by, contributing, to, metal, magazines, and, more, recently, websites, attending, live, concerts, in, particular, has, been, called, the, holiest, of, heavy, metal, communions, the, metal, scene, has, been, characterized, as, a, subculture, of, alienation, with, its, own, code, of, authenticity, this, code, puts, several, demands, on, performers, they, must, appear, both, completely, devoted, to, their, music, and, loyal, to, the, subculture, that, supports, it, they, must, appear, uninterested, in, mainstream, appeal, and, radio, hits, and, they, must, never, sell, out, deena, weinstein, stated, that, for, the, fans, themselves, the, code, promotes, opposition, to, established, authority, and, separateness, from, the, rest, of, society, musician, and, filmmaker, rob, zombie, observed, most, of, the, kids, who, come, to, my, shows, seem, like, really, imaginative, kids, with, a, lot, of, creative, energy, they, don, t, know, what, to, do, with, and, that, metal, is, outsider, music, for, outsiders, nobody, wants, to, be, the, weird, kid, you, just, somehow, end, up, being, the, weird, kid, it, s, kind, of, like, that, but, with, metal, you, have, all, the, weird, kids, in, one, place, scholars, of, metal, have, noted, the, tendency, of, fans, to, classify, and, reject, some, performers, and, some, other, fans, as, poseurs, who, pretended, to, be, part, of, the, subculture, but, who, were, deemed, to, lack, authenticity, and, sincerity, the, origin, of, the, term, heavy, metal, in, a, musical, context, is, uncertain, the, phrase, has, been, used, for, centuries, in, chemistry, and, metallurgy, where, the, periodic, table, organizes, elements, of, both, light, and, heavy, metals, e, g, uranium, an, early, use, of, the, term, in, modern, popular, culture, was, by, countercultural, writer, william, s, burroughs, his, 1961, novel, the, soft, machine, includes, a, character, known, as, uranian, willy, the, heavy, metal, kid, burroughs, next, novel, nova, express, 1964, develops, the, theme, using, heavy, metal, as, a, metaphor, for, addictive, drugs, with, their, diseases, and, orgasm, drugs, and, their, sexless, parasite, life,
