where, most, students, were, more, interested, in, activities, other, than, schooling, most, of, the, students, received, stipends, even, though, they, were, the, richest, in, the, state, the, grimms,

savigny, and, were, able, to, use, his, personal, library, as, they, became, interested, in, german, law, history, and, folklore, savigny, asked, jacob, to, join, him, in, paris, as, an, assistant, and, jacob, went, with, him, for, a, year, while, he, was, gone, wilhelm, became, very, interested, in, german, literature, and, started, collecting, books, once, jacob, returned, to, kassel, in,

on, to, receive, his, degree, in, law, at, marburg, during, the, napoleonic, wars, jacob, interrupted, his, studies, to, serve, the, hessian, war, commission, in, 1808, their, mother, died, and, this, was, especially, hard, on, jacob, as, he, took, the, position, of, father, figure, while, also, trying, to, be, a, brother, from, 1806, to, 1810, the, grimm, family, had, barely, enough, money, to, properly, feed, and, clothe, themselves, during, this, time, jacob, and, wilhelm, were, concerned, about, the, stability, of, the, family, achim, von, arnim, and, clemens, brentano, were, good, friends, of, the, brothers, and, wanted, to, publish, folk, tales, so, they, asked, the, brothers, to, collect, oral, tales, for, publication, the, grimms, collected, many, old, books, and, asked, friends, and, acquaintances, in, kassel, to, tell, tales, and, to, gather, stories, from, others, jacob, and, wilhelm, sought, to, collect, these, stories, in, order, to, write, a, history, of, old, german, poesie, and, to, preserve, history, the, first, volume, of, the, first, edition, was, published, in, 1812, containing, 86, stories, the, second, volume, of, 70, stories, followed, in, 1815, for, the, second, edition, two, volumes, containing, the, kinder, und, hausm, rchen, khm, texts, were, issued, in, 1819, and, the, appendix, was, removed, and, published, separately, in, the, third,

edition, in, 1857, stories, were, added, and, also, removed, from, one, edition, to, the, next, until, the, seventh, held, 210, tales, some, later, editions, were, extensively, illustrated, first, by, philipp, grot, johann, and, after, his, death, in, 1892, by, german, illustrator, robert, leinweber, the, first, volumes, were, much, criticized, because, although, they, were, called, children, s, tales, they, were, not, regarded, as, suitable, for, children, both, for, the, scholarly, information, included, and, the, subject, matter, many, changes, through, the, editions, such, as, turning, the, wicked, mother, of, the, first, edition, in, snow, white, and, hansel, and, gretel, shown, in, original, grimm, stories, as, h, nsel, und, grethel, to, a, stepmother, were, probably, made, with, an, eye, to, such, suitability, jack, zipes, believes, that, the, grimms, made, the, change, in, later, editions, because, they, held, motherhood, sacred, they, removed, sexual, references, such, as, rapunzel, s, innocently, asking, why, her, dress, was, getting, tight, around, her, belly, and, thus, naively, revealing, to, the, witch, dame, gothel, her, pregnancy, and, the, prince, s, visits, but, in, many, respects, violence, particularly, when, punishing, villains, became, more, prevalent, the, brothers, initial, intention, of, their, first, book, children, s, and, household, tales, was, to, establish, a, name, for, themselves, in, the, world, after, publishing, the, first, khm, in, 1812, they, published, a, second, augmented, and, re, edited, volume, in, 1815, in, 1816, volume, i,

tales, and, leading, them, to, similarly, believe, in, a, spirit, of, romantic, nationalism, that, the, fairy, tales, of, a, country, were, particularly, representative, of, it, to, the, neglect, of,
