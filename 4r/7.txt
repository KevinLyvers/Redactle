proportion, is, a, central, principle, of, architectural, theory, and, an, important, connection, between, mathematics, and, art, it, is, the, visual, effect, of, the, relationship, of, the, various, objects, and, spaces, that, make, up, a, structure, to, one, another, and, to, the, whole, these, relationships, are, often, governed, by, multiples, of, a, standard, unit, of, length, known, as, a, module, proportion, in, architecture, was, discussed, by, vitruvius, leon, battista, alberti, andrea, palladio, and, le, corbusier, among, others, architecture, in, roman, antiquity, was, rarely, documented, except, in, the, writings, of, vitruvius, treatise, de, architectura, vitruvius, served, as, an, engineer, under, julius, caesar, during, the, first, gallic, wars, 58, 50, bc, the, treatise, was, dedicated, to, emperor, augustus, as, vitruvius, defined, the, concept, in, the, first, chapters, of, the, treatise, he, mentioned, the, three, prerequisites, of, architecture, are, firmness, firmitas, commodity, utilitas, and, delight, venustas, which, require, the, architects, to, be, equipped, with, a, varied, kind, of, learning, and, knowledge, of, many, branches, moreover, vitruvius, identified, the, six, principles, of, design, as, order, ordinatio, arrangement, dispositio, proportion, eurythmia, symmetry, symmetria, propriety, decor, and, economy, distributio, among, the, six, principles, proportion, interrelates, and, supports, all, the, other, factors, in, geometrical, forms, and, arithmetical, ratios, the, word, symmetria, usually, translated, to, symmetry, in, modern, renderings, in, ancient, times, meant, something, more, closely, related, to, mathematical, harmony, and, measurable, proportions, vitruvius, tried, to, describe, his, theory, in, the, makeup, of, the, human, body, which, he, referred, to, as, the, perfect, or, golden, ratio, the, principles, of, measurement, units, digit, foot, and, cubit, also, came, from, the, dimensions, of, a, vitruvian, man, more, specifically, vitruvius, used, the, total, height, of, 6, feet, of, a, person, and, each, part, of, the, body, takes, up, a, different, ratio, for, example, the, face, is, about, 1, 10, of, the, total, height, and, the, head, is, about, 1, 8, of, the, total, height, vitruvius, used, these, ratios, to, prove, that, the, composition, of, classical, orders, mimicked, the, human, body, thereby, ensuring, aesthetic, harmonization, when, people, viewed, architectural, columns, in, classical, architecture, the, module, was, established, as, the, radius, of, the, lower, shaft, of, a, classical, column, with, proportions, expressed, as, a, fraction, or, multiple, of, that, module, in, his, le, modulor, 1948, le, corbusier, presented, a, system, of, proportions, which, took, the, golden, ratio, and, a, man, with, a, raised, arm, as, the, scalable, modules, of, proportion
