post, impressionism, also, spelled, postimpressionism, was, a, predominantly, french, art, movement, that, developed, roughly, between, 1886, and, 1905, from, the, last, impressionist, exhibition, to, the, birth, of, fauvism, post, impressionism, emerged, as, a, reaction, against, impressionists, concern, for, the, naturalistic, depiction, of, light, and, colour, its, broad, emphasis, on, abstract, qualities, or, symbolic, content, means, post, impressionism, encompasses, les, nabis, neo, impressionism, symbolism, cloisonnism, the, pont, aven, school, and, synthetism, along, with, some, later, impressionists, work, the, movement, s, principal, artists, were, paul, c, zanne, known, as, the, father, of, post, impressionism, paul, gauguin, vincent, van, gogh, and, georges, seurat, the, term, post, impressionism, was, first, used, by, art, critic, roger, fry, in, 1906, critic, frank, rutter, in, a, review, of, the, salon, d, automne, published, in, art, news, 15, october, 1910, described, othon, friesz, as, a, post, impressionist, leader, there, was, also, an, advert, for, the, show, the, post, impressionists, of, france, three, weeks, later, roger, fry, used, the, term, again, when, he, organised, the, 1910, exhibition, manet, and, the, post, impressionists, defining, it, as, the, development, of, french, art, since, douard, manet, post, impressionists, extended, impressionism, while, rejecting, its, limitations, they, continued, using, vivid, colours, sometimes, using, impasto, thick, application, of, paint, and, painting, from, life, but, were, more, inclined, to, emphasize, geometric, forms, distort, form, for, expressive, effect, and, use, unnatural, or, modified, colour, the, post, impressionists, were, dissatisfied, with, what, they, felt, was, the, triviality, of, subject, matter, and, the, loss, of, structure, in, impressionist, paintings, though, they, did, not, agree, on, the, way, forward, georges, seurat, and, his, followers, concerned, themselves, with, pointillism, the, systematic, use, of, tiny, dots, of, colour, paul, c, zanne, set, out, to, restore, a, sense, of, order, and, structure, to, painting, to, make, of, impressionism, something, solid, and, durable, like, the, art, of, the, museums, he, achieved, this, by, reducing, objects, to, their, basic, shapes, while, retaining, the, saturated, colours, of, impressionism, the, impressionist, camille, pissarro, experimented, with, neo, impressionist, ideas, between, the, mid, 1880s, and, the, early, 1890s, discontented, with, what, he, referred, to, as, romantic, impressionism, he, investigated, pointillism, which, he, called, scientific, impressionism, before, returning, to, a, purer, impressionism, in, the, last, decade, of, his, life, vincent, van, gogh, often, used, vibrant, colour, and, conspicuous, brushstrokes, to, convey, his, feelings, and, his, state, of, mind, although, they, often, exhibited, together, post, impressionist, artists, were, not, in, agreement, concerning, a, cohesive, movement, yet, the, abstract, concerns, of, harmony, and, structural, arrangement, in, the, work, of, all, these, artists, took, precedence, over, naturalism, artists, such, as, seurat, adopted, a, meticulously, scientific, approach, to, colour, and, composition, the, term, was, used, in, 1906, and, again, in, 1910, by, roger, fry, in, the, title, of, an, exhibition, of, modern, french, painters, manet, and, the, post, impressionists, organized, by, fry, for, the, grafton, galleries, in, london, three, weeks, before, fry, s, show, art, critic, frank, rutter, had, put, the, term, post, impressionist, in, print, in, art, news, of, 15, october, 1910, during, a, review, of, the, salon, d, automne, where, he, described, othon, friesz, as, a, post, impressionist, leader, there, was, also, an, advert, in, the, journal, for, the, show, the, post, impressionists, of, france, most, of, the, artists, in, fry, s, exhibition, were, younger, than, the, impressionists, fry, later, explained, for, purposes, of, convenience, it, was, necessary, to, give, these, artists, a, name, and, i, chose, as, being, the, vaguest, and, most, non, committal, the, name, of, post, impressionism, this, merely, stated, their, position, in, time, relatively, to, the, impressionist, movement, john, rewald, limited, the, scope, to, the, years, between, 1886, and, 1892, in, his, pioneering, publication, on, post, impressionism, from, van, gogh, to, gauguin, 1956, rewald, considered, this, a, continuation, of, his, 1946, study, history, of, impressionism, and, pointed, out, that, a, subsequent, volume, dedicated, to, the, second, half, of, the, post, impressionist, period, post, impressionism, from, gauguin, to, matisse, was, to, follow, this, volume, would, extend, the, period, covered, to, other, artistic, movements, derived, from, impressionism, though, confined, to, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, rewald, focused, on, such, outstanding, early, post, impressionists, active, in, france, as, van, gogh, gauguin, seurat, and, redon, he, explored, their, relationships, as, well, as, the, artistic, circles, they, frequented, or, were, in, opposition, to, including, furthermore, in, his, introduction, to, post, impressionism, rewald, opted, for, a, second, volume, featuring, toulouse, lautrec, henri, rousseau, le, douanier, les, nabis, and, c, zanne, as, well, as, the, fauves, the, young, picasso, and, gauguin, s, last, trip, to, the, south, seas, it, was, to, expand, the, period, covered, at, least, into, the, first, decade, of, the, 20th, century, yet, this, second, volume, remained, unfinished, rewald, wrote, that, the, term, post, impressionism, is, not, a, very, precise, one, though, a, very, convenient, one, convenient, when, the, term, is, by, definition, limited, to, french, visual, arts, derived, from, impressionism, since, 1886, rewald, s, approach, to, historical, data, was, narrative, rather, than, analytic, and, beyond, this, point, he, believed, it, would, be, sufficient, to, let, the, sources, speak, for, themselves, rival, terms, like, modernism, or, symbolism, were, never, as, easy, to, handle, for, they, covered, literature, architecture, and, other, arts, as, well, and, they, expanded, to, other, countries, to, meet, the, recent, discussion, the, connotations, of, the, term, post, impressionism, were, challenged, again, alan, bowness, and, his, collaborators, expanded, the, period, covered, forward, to, 1914, and, the, beginning, of, world, war, i, but, limited, their, approach, widely, on, the, 1890s, to, france, other, european, countries, are, pushed, back, to, standard, connotations, and, eastern, europe, is, completely, excluded, so, while, a, split, may, be, seen, between, classical, impressionism, and, post, impressionism, in, 1886, the, end, and, the, extent, of, post, impressionism, remains, under, discussion, for, bowness, and, his, contributors, as, well, as, for, rewald, cubism, was, an, absolutely, fresh, start, and, so, cubism, has, been, seen, in, france, since, the, beginning, and, later, in, england, meanwhile, eastern, european, artists, however, did, not, care, so, much, for, western, traditions, and, proceeded, to, manners, of, painting, called, abstract, and, suprematic, terms, expanding, far, into, the, 20th, century, according, to, the, present, state, of, discussion, post, impressionism, is, a, term, best, used, within, rewald, s, definition, in, a, strictly, historical, manner, concentrating, on, french, art, between, 1886, and, 1914, and, re, considering, the, altered, positions, of, impressionist, painters, like, claude, monet, camille, pissarro, auguste, renoir, and, others, as, well, as, all, new, schools, and, movements, at, the, turn, of, the, century, from, cloisonnism, to, cubism, the, declarations, of, war, in, july, august, 1914, indicate, probably, far, more, than, the, beginning, of, a, world, war, they, signal, a, major, break, in, european, cultural, history, too, along, with, general, art, history, information, given, about, post, impressionism, works, there, are, many, museums, that, offer, additional, history, information, and, gallery, works, both, online, and, in, house, that, can, help, viewers, understand, a, deeper, meaning, of, post, impressionism, in, terms, of, fine, art, and, traditional, art, applications, the, advent, of, modernism, post, impressionism, and, north, american, art, 1900, 1918, by, peter, morrin, judith, zilczer, and, william, c, agee, the, catalogue, for, an, exhibition, at, the, high, museum, of, art, atlanta, in, 1986, gave, a, major, overview, of, post, impressionism, in, north, america, canadian, post, impressionism,

reviewed, with, sharp, criticism, by, the, montreal, daily, witness, and, the, montreal, daily, star, post, impressionism, was, extended, to, include, a, painting, by, lyman, who, had, studied, with, matisse, lyman, wrote, in, defence, of, the, term, and, defined, it, he, referred, to, the, british, show, which, he, described, as, a, great, exhibition, of, modern, art, a, wide, and, diverse, variety, of, artists, are, called, by, this, name, in, canada, among, them, are, james, wilson, morrice, john, lyman, david, milne, and, tom, thomson, members, of, the, group, of, seven, and, emily,
