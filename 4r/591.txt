computer, graphics, deals, with, generating, images, and, art, with, the, aid, of, computers, computer, graphics, is, a, core, technology, in, digital, photography, film, video, games, digital, art, cell, phone, and, computer, displays, and, many, specialized, applications, a, great, deal, of, specialized, hardware, and, software, has, been, developed, with, the, displays, of, most, devices, being, driven, by, computer, graphics, hardware, it, is, a, vast, and, recently, developed, area, of, computer, science, the, phrase, was, coined, in, 1960, by, computer, graphics, researchers, verne, hudson, and, william, fetter, of, boeing, it, is, often, abbreviated, as, cg, or, typically, in, the, context, of, film, as, computer, generated, imagery, cgi, the, non, artistic, aspects, of, computer, graphics, are, the, subject, of, computer, science, research, some, topics, in, computer, graphics, include, user, interface, design, sprite, graphics, rendering, ray, tracing, geometry, processing, computer, animation, vector, graphics, 3d, modeling, shaders, gpu, design, implicit, surfaces, visualization, scientific, computing, image, processing, computational, photography, scientific, visualization, computational, geometry, and, computer, vision, among, others, the, overall, methodology, depends, heavily, on, the, underlying, sciences, of, geometry, optics, physics, and, perception, computer, graphics, is, responsible, for, displaying, art, and, image, data, effectively, and, meaningfully, to, the, consumer, it, is, also, used, for, processing, image, data, received, from, the, physical, world, such, as, photo, and, video, content, computer, graphics, development, has, had, a, significant, impact, on, many, types, of, media, and, has, revolutionized, animation, movies, advertising, and, video, games, in, general, the, term, computer, graphics, has, been, used, in, a, broad, sense, to, describe, almost, everything, on, computers, that, is, not, text, or, sound, typically, the, term, computer, graphics, refers, to, several, different, things, today, computer, graphics, is, widespread, such, imagery, is, found, in, and, on, television, newspapers, weather, reports, and, in, a, variety, of, medical, investigations, and, surgical, procedures, a, well, constructed, graph, can, present, complex, statistics, in, a, form, that, is, easier, to, understand, and, interpret, in, the, media, such, graphs, are, used, to, illustrate, papers, reports, theses, and, other, presentation, material, many, tools, have, been, developed, to, visualize, data, computer, generated, imagery, can, be, categorized, into, several, different, types, two, dimensional, 2d, three, dimensional, 3d, and, animated, graphics, as, technology, has, improved, 3d, computer, graphics, have, become, more, common, but, 2d, computer, graphics, are, still, widely, used, computer, graphics, has, emerged, as, a, sub, field, of, computer, science, which, studies, methods, for, digitally, synthesizing, and, manipulating, visual, content, over, the, past, decade, other, specialized, fields, have, been, developed, like, information, visualization, and, scientific, visualization, more, concerned, with, the, visualization, of, three, dimensional, phenomena, architectural, meteorological, medical, biological, etc, where, the, emphasis, is, on, realistic, renderings, of, volumes, surfaces, illumination, sources, and, so, forth, perhaps, with, a, dynamic, time, component, the, precursor, sciences, to, the, development, of, modern, computer, graphics, were, the, advances, in, electrical, engineering, electronics, and, television, that, took, place, during, the, first, half, of, the, twentieth, century, screens, could, display, art, since, the, lumiere, brothers, use, of, mattes, to, create, special, effects, for, the, earliest, films, dating, from, 1895, but, such, displays, were, limited, and, not, interactive, the, first, cathode, ray, tube, the, braun, tube, was, invented, in, 1897, it, in, turn, would, permit, the, oscilloscope, and, the, military, control, panel, the, more, direct, precursors, of, the, field, as, they, provided, the, first, two, dimensional, electronic, displays, that, responded, to, programmatic, or, user, input, nevertheless, computer, graphics, remained, relatively, unknown, as, a, discipline, until, the, 1950s, and, the, post, world, war, ii, period, during, which, time, the, discipline, emerged, from, a, combination, of, both, pure, university, and, laboratory, academic, research, into, more, advanced, computers, and, the, united, states, military, s, further, development, of, technologies, like, radar, aviation, and, rocketry, developed, during, the, war, new, kinds, of, displays, were, needed, to, process, the, wealth, of, information, resulting, from, such, projects, leading, to, the, development, of, computer, graphics, as, a, discipline, early, projects, like, the, whirlwind, and, sage, projects, introduced, the, crt, as, a, viable, display, and, interaction, interface, and, introduced, the, light, pen, as, an, input, device, douglas, t, ross, of, the, whirlwind, sage, system, performed, a, personal, experiment, in, which, he, wrote, a, small, program, that, captured, the, movement, of, his, finger, and, displayed, its, vector, his, traced, name, on, a, display, scope, one, of, the, first, interactive, video, games, to, feature, recognizable, interactive, graphics, tennis, for, two, was, created, for, an, oscilloscope, by, william, higinbotham, to, entertain, visitors, in, 1958, at, brookhaven, national, laboratory, and, simulated, a, tennis, match, in, 1959, douglas, t, ross, while, working, at, mit, on, transforming, mathematic, statements, into, computer, generated, 3d, machine, tool, vectors, created, a, display, scope, image, of, a, disney, cartoon, character, electronics, pioneer, hewlett, packard, went, public, in, 1957, after, incorporating, the, decade, prior, and, established, strong, ties, with, stanford, university, through, its, founders, who, were, alumni, this, began, the, decades, long, transformation, of, the, southern, san, francisco, bay, area, into, the, world, s, leading, computer, technology, hub, now, known, as, silicon, valley, the, field, of, computer, graphics, developed, with, the, emergence, of, computer, graphics, hardware, further, advances, in, computing, led, to, greater, advancements, in, interactive, computer, graphics, in, 1959, the, tx, 2, computer, was, developed, at, mit, s, lincoln, laboratory, the, tx, 2, integrated, a, number, of, new, man, machine, interfaces, a, light, pen, could, be, used, to, draw, sketches, on, the, computer, using, ivan, sutherland, s, revolutionary, sketchpad, software, using, a, light, pen, sketchpad, allowed, one, to, draw, simple, shapes, on, the, computer, screen, save, them, and, even, recall, them, later, the, light, pen, itself, had, a, small, photoelectric, cell, in, its, tip, this, cell, emitted, an, electronic, pulse, whenever, it, was, placed, in, front, of, a, computer, screen, and, the, screen, s, electron, gun, fired, directly, at, it, by, simply, timing, the, electronic, pulse, with, the, current, location, of, the, electron, gun, it, was, easy, to, pinpoint, exactly, where, the, pen, was, on, the, screen, at, any, given, moment, once, that, was, determined, the, computer, could, then, draw, a, cursor, at, that, location, sutherland, seemed, to, find, the, perfect, solution, for, many, of, the, graphics, problems, he, faced, even, today, many, standards, of, computer, graphics, interfaces, got, their, start, with, this, early, sketchpad, program, one, example, of, this, is, in, drawing, constraints, if, one, wants, to, draw, a, square, for, example, they, do, not, have, to, worry, about, drawing, four, lines, perfectly, to, form, the, edges, of, the, box, one, can, simply, specify, that, they, want, to, draw, a, box, and, then, specify, the, location, and, size, of, the, box, the, software, will, then, construct, a, perfect, box, with, the, right, dimensions, and, at, the, right, location, another, example, is, that, sutherland, s, software, modeled, objects, not, just, a, picture, of, objects, in, other, words, with, a, model, of, a, car, one, could, change, the, size, of, the, tires, without, affecting, the, rest, of, the, car, it, could, stretch, the, body, of, car, without, deforming, the, tires, the, phrase, computer, graphics, has, been, credited, to, william, fetter, a, graphic, designer, for, boeing, in, 1960, fetter, in, turn, attributed, it, to, verne, hudson, also, at, boeing, in, 1961, another, student, at, mit, steve, russell, created, another, important, title, in, the, history, of, video, games, spacewar, written, for, the, dec, pdp, 1, spacewar, was, an, instant, success, and, copies, started, flowing, to, other, pdp, 1, owners, and, eventually, dec, got, a, copy, the, engineers, at, dec, used, it, as, a, diagnostic, program, on, every, new, pdp, 1, before, shipping, it, the, sales, force, picked, up, on, this, quickly, enough, and, when, installing, new, units, would, run, the, world, s, first, video, game, for, their, new, customers, higginbotham, s, tennis, for, two, had, beaten, spacewar, by, almost, three, years, but, it, was, almost, unknown, outside, of, a, research, or, academic, setting, at, around, the, same, time, 1961, 1962, in, the, university, of, cambridge, elizabeth, waldram, wrote, code, to, display, radio, astronomy, maps, on, a, cathode, ray, tube, e, e, zajac, a, scientist, at, bell, telephone, laboratory, btl, created, a, film, called, simulation, of, a, two, giro, gravity, attitude, control, system, in, 1963, in, this, computer, generated, film, zajac, showed, how, the, attitude, of, a, satellite, could, be, altered, as, it, orbits, the, earth, he, created, the, animation, on, an, ibm, 7090, mainframe, computer, also, at, btl, ken, knowlton, frank, sinden, ruth, a, weiss, and, michael, noll, started, working, in, the, computer, graphics, field, sinden, created, a, film, called, force, mass, and, motion, illustrating, newton, s, laws, of, motion, in, operation, around, the, same, time, other, scientists, were, creating, computer, graphics, to, illustrate, their, research, at, lawrence, radiation, laboratory, nelson, max, created, the, films, flow, of, a, viscous, fluid, and, propagation, of, shock, waves, in, a, solid, form, boeing, aircraft, created, a, film, called, vibration, of, an, aircraft, also, sometime, in, the, early, 1960s, automobiles, would, also, provide, a, boost, through, the, early, work, of, pierre, b, zier, at, renault, who, used, paul, de, casteljau, s, curves, now, called, b, zier, curves, after, b, zier, s, work, in, the, field, to, develop, 3d, modeling, techniques, for, renault, car, bodies, these, curves, would, form, the, foundation, for, much, curve, modeling, work, in, the, field, as, curves, unlike, polygons, are, mathematically, complex, entities, to, draw, and, model, well, it, was, not, long, before, major, corporations, started, taking, an, interest, in, computer, graphics, trw, lockheed, georgia, general, electric, and, sperry, rand, are, among, the, many, companies, that, were, getting, started, in, computer, graphics, by, the, mid, 1960s, ibm, was, quick, to, respond, to, this, interest, by, releasing, the, ibm, 2250, graphics, terminal, the, first, commercially, available, graphics, computer, ralph, baer, a, supervising, engineer, at, sanders, associates, came, up, with, a, home, video, game, in, 1966, that, was, later, licensed, to, magnavox, and, called, the, odyssey, while, very, simplistic, and, requiring, fairly, inexpensive, electronic, parts, it, allowed, the, player, to, move, points, of, light, around, on, a, screen, it, was, the, first, consumer, computer, graphics, product, david, c, evans, was, director, of, engineering, at, bendix, corporation, s, computer, division, from, 1953, to, 1962, after, which, he, worked, for, the, next, five, years, as, a, visiting, professor, at, berkeley, there, he, continued, his, interest, in, computers, and, how, they, interfaced, with, people, in, 1966, the, university, of, utah, recruited, evans, to, form, a, computer, science, program, and, computer, graphics, quickly, became, his, primary, interest, this, new, department, would, become, the, world, s, primary, research, center, for, computer, graphics, through, the, 1970s, also, in, 1966, ivan, sutherland, continued, to, innovate, at, mit, when, he, invented, the, first, computer, controlled, head, mounted, display, hmd, it, displayed, two, separate, wireframe, images, one, for, each, eye, this, allowed, the, viewer, to, see, the, computer, scene, in, stereoscopic, 3d, the, heavy, hardware, required, for, supporting, the, display, and, tracker, was, called, the, sword, of, damocles, because, of, the, potential, danger, if, it, were, to, fall, upon, the, wearer, after, receiving, his, ph, d, from, mit, sutherland, became, director, of, information, processing, at, arpa, advanced, research, projects, agency, and, later, became, a, professor, at, harvard, in, 1967, sutherland, was, recruited, by, evans, to, join, the, computer, science, program, at, the, university, of, utah, a, development, which, would, turn, that, department, into, one, of, the, most, important, research, centers, in, graphics, for, nearly, a, decade, thereafter, eventually, producing, some, of, the, most, important, pioneers, in, the, field, there, sutherland, perfected, his, hmd, twenty, years, later, nasa, would, re, discover, his, techniques, in, their, virtual, reality, research, at, utah, sutherland, and, evans, were, highly, sought, after, consultants, by, large, companies, but, they, were, frustrated, at, the, lack, of, graphics, hardware, available, at, the, time, so, they, started, formulating, a, plan, to, start, their, own, company, in, 1968, dave, evans, and, ivan, sutherland, founded, the, first, computer, graphics, hardware, company, evans, sutherland, while, sutherland, originally, wanted, the, company, to, be, located, in, cambridge, massachusetts, salt, lake, city, was, instead, chosen, due, to, its, proximity, to, the, professors, research, group, at, the, university, of, utah, also, in, 1968, arthur, appel, described, the, first, ray, casting, algorithm, the, first, of, a, class, of, ray, tracing, based, rendering, algorithms, that, have, since, become, fundamental, in, achieving, photorealism, in, graphics, by, modeling, the, paths, that, rays, of, light, take, from, a, light, source, to, surfaces, in, a, scene, and, into, the, camera, in, 1969, the, acm, initiated, a, special, interest, group, on, graphics, siggraph, which, organizes, conferences, graphics, standards, and, publications, within, the, field, of, computer, graphics, by, 1973, the, first, annual, siggraph, conference, was, held, which, has, become, one, of, the, focuses, of, the, organization, siggraph, has, grown, in, size, and, importance, as, the, field, of, computer, graphics, has, expanded, over, time, subsequently, a, number, of, breakthroughs, in, the, field, occurred, at, the, university, of, utah, in, the, 1970s, which, had, hired, ivan, sutherland, he, was, paired, with, david, c, evans, to, teach, an, advanced, computer, graphics, class, which, contributed, a, great, deal, of, founding, research, to, the, field, and, taught, several, students, who, would, grow, to, found, several, of, the, industry, s, most, important, companies, namely, pixar, silicon, graphics, and, adobe, systems, tom, stockham, led, the, image, processing, group, at, uu, which, worked, closely, with, the, computer, graphics, lab, one, of, these, students, was, edwin, catmull, catmull, had, just, come, from, the, boeing, company, and, had, been, working, on, his, degree, in, physics, growing, up, on, disney, catmull, loved, animation, yet, quickly, discovered, that, he, did, not, have, the, talent, for, drawing, now, catmull, along, with, many, others, saw, computers, as, the, natural, progression, of, animation, and, they, wanted, to, be, part, of, the, revolution, the, first, computer, animation, that, catmull, saw, was, his, own, he, created, an, animation, of, his, hand, opening, and, closing, he, also, pioneered, texture, mapping, to, paint, textures, on, three, dimensional, models, in, 1974, now, considered, one, of, the, fundamental, techniques, in, 3d, modeling, it, became, one, of, his, goals, to, produce, a, feature, length, motion, picture, using, computer, graphics, a, goal, he, would, achieve, two, decades, later, after, his, founding, role, in, pixar, in, the, same, class, fred, parke, created, an, animation, of, his, wife, s, face, the, two, animations, were, included, in, the, 1976, feature, film, futureworld, as, the, uu, computer, graphics, laboratory, was, attracting, people, from, all, over, john, warnock, was, another, of, those, early, pioneers, he, later, founded, adobe, systems, and, created, a, revolution, in, the, publishing, world, with, his, postscript, page, description, language, adobe, would, go, on, later, to, create, the, industry, standard, photo, editing, software, in, adobe, photoshop, and, a, prominent, movie, industry, special, effects, program, in, adobe, after, effects, james, clark, was, also, there, he, later, founded, silicon, graphics, a, maker, of, advanced, rendering, systems, that, would, dominate, the, field, of, high, end, graphics, until, the, early, 1990s, a, major, advance, in, 3d, computer, graphics, was, created, at, uu, by, these, early, pioneers, hidden, surface, determination, in, order, to, draw, a, representation, of, a, 3d, object, on, the, screen, the, computer, must, determine, which, surfaces, are, behind, the, object, from, the, viewer, s, perspective, and, thus, should, be, hidden, when, the, computer, creates, or, renders, the, image, the, 3d, core, graphics, system, or, core, was, the, first, graphical, standard, to, be, developed, a, group, of, 25, experts, of, the, acm, special, interest, group, siggraph, developed, this, conceptual, framework, the, specifications, were, published, in, 1977, and, it, became, a, foundation, for, many, future, developments, in, the, field, also, in, the, 1970s, henri, gouraud, jim, blinn, and, bui, tuong, phong, contributed, to, the, foundations, of, shading, in, cgi, via, the, development, of, the, gouraud, shading, and, blinn, phong, shading, models, allowing, graphics, to, move, beyond, a, flat, look, to, a, look, more, accurately, portraying, depth, jim, blinn, also, innovated, further, in, 1978, by, introducing, bump, mapping, a, technique, for, simulating, uneven, surfaces, and, the, predecessor, to, many, more, advanced, kinds, of, mapping, used, today, the, modern, videogame, arcade, as, is, known, today, was, birthed, in, the, 1970s, with, the, first, arcade, games, using, real, time, 2d, sprite, graphics, pong, in, 1972, was, one, of, the, first, hit, arcade, cabinet, games, speed, race, in, 1974, featured, sprites, moving, along, a, vertically, scrolling, road, gun, fight, in, 1975, featured, human, looking, animated, characters, while, space, invaders, in, 1978, featured, a, large, number, of, animated, figures, on, screen, both, used, a, specialized, barrel, shifter, circuit, made, from, discrete, chips, to, help, their, intel, 8080, microprocessor, animate, their, framebuffer, graphics, the, 1980s, began, to, see, the, commercialization, of, computer, graphics, as, the, home, computer, proliferated, a, subject, which, had, previously, been, an, academics, only, discipline, was, adopted, by, a, much, larger, audience, and, the, number, of, computer, graphics, developers, increased, significantly, in, the, early, 1980s, metal, oxide, semiconductor, mos, very, large, scale, integration, vlsi, technology, led, to, the, availability, of, 16, bit, central, processing, unit, cpu, microprocessors, and, the, first, graphics, processing, unit, gpu, chips, which, began, to, revolutionize, computer, graphics, enabling, high, resolution, graphics, for, computer, graphics, terminals, as, well, as, personal, computer, pc, systems, nec, s, pd7220, was, the, first, gpu, fabricated, on, a, fully, integrated, nmos, vlsi, chip, it, supported, up, to, 1024x1024, resolution, and, laid, the, foundations, for, the, emerging, pc, graphics, market, it, was, used, in, a, number, of, graphics, cards, and, was, licensed, for, clones, such, as, the, intel, 82720, the, first, of, intel, s, graphics, processing, units, mos, memory, also, became, cheaper, in, the, early, 1980s, enabling, the, development, of, affordable, framebuffer, memory, notably, video, ram, vram, introduced, by, texas, instruments, ti, in, the, mid, 1980s, in, 1984, hitachi, released, the, artc, hd63484, the, first, complementary, mos, cmos, gpu, it, was, capable, of, displaying, high, resolution, in, color, mode, and, up, to, 4k, resolution, in, monochrome, mode, and, it, was, used, in, a, number, of, graphics, cards, and, terminals, during, the, late, 1980s, in, 1986, ti, introduced, the, tms34010, the, first, fully, programmable, mos, graphics, processor, computer, graphics, terminals, during, this, decade, became, increasingly, intelligent, semi, standalone, and, standalone, workstations, graphics, and, application, processing, were, increasingly, migrated, to, the, intelligence, in, the, workstation, rather, than, continuing, to, rely, on, central, mainframe, and, minicomputers, typical, of, the, early, move, to, high, resolution, computer, graphics, intelligent, workstations, for, the, computer, aided, engineering, market, were, the, orca, 1000, 2000, and, 3000, workstations, developed, by, orcatech, of, ottawa, a, spin, off, from, bell, northern, research, and, led, by, david, pearson, an, early, workstation, pioneer, the, orca, 3000, was, based, on, the, 16, bit, motorola, 68000, microprocessor, and, amd, bit, slice, processors, and, had, unix, as, its, operating, system, it, was, targeted, squarely, at, the, sophisticated, end, of, the, design, engineering, sector, artists, and, graphic, designers, began, to, see, the, personal, computer, particularly, the, amiga, and, macintosh, as, a, serious, design, tool, one, that, could, save, time, and, draw, more, accurately, than, other, methods, the, macintosh, remains, a, highly, popular, tool, for, computer, graphics, among, graphic, design, studios, and, businesses, modern, computers, dating, from, the, 1980s, often, use, graphical, user, interfaces, gui, to, present, data, and, information, with, symbols, icons, and, pictures, rather, than, text, graphics, are, one, of, the, five, key, elements, of, multimedia, technology, in, the, field, of, realistic, rendering, japan, s, osaka, university, developed, the, links, 1, computer, graphics, system, a, supercomputer, that, used, up, to, 257, zilog, z8001, microprocessors, in, 1982, for, the, purpose, of, rendering, realistic, 3d, computer, graphics, according, to, the, information, processing, society, of, japan, the, core, of, 3d, image, rendering, is, calculating, the, luminance, of, each, pixel, making, up, a, rendered, surface, from, the, given, viewpoint, light, source, and, object, position, the, links, 1, system, was, developed, to, realize, an, image, rendering, methodology, in, which, each, pixel, could, be, parallel, processed, independently, using, ray, tracing, by, developing, a, new, software, methodology, specifically, for, high, speed, image, rendering, links, 1, was, able, to, rapidly, render, highly, realistic, images, the, links, 1, was, the, world, s, most, powerful, computer, as, of, 1984, also, in, the, field, of, realistic, rendering, the, general, rendering, equation, of, david, immel, and, james, kajiya, was, developed, in, 1986, an, important, step, towards, implementing, global, illumination, which, is, necessary, to, pursue, photorealism, in, computer, graphics, the, continuing, popularity, of, star, wars, and, other, science, fiction, franchises, were, relevant, in, cinematic, cgi, at, this, time, as, lucasfilm, and, industrial, light, magic, became, known, as, the, go, to, house, by, many, other, studios, for, topnotch, computer, graphics, in, film, important, advances, in, chroma, keying, bluescreening, etc, were, made, for, the, later, films, of, the, original, trilogy, two, other, pieces, of, video, would, also, outlast, the, era, as, historically, relevant, dire, straits, iconic, near, fully, cgi, video, for, their, song, money, for, nothing, in, 1985, which, popularized, cgi, among, music, fans, of, that, era, and, a, scene, from, young, sherlock, holmes, the, same, year, featuring, the, first, fully, cgi, character, in, a, feature, movie, an, animated, stained, glass, knight, in, 1988, the, first, shaders, small, programs, designed, specifically, to, do, shading, as, a, separate, algorithm, were, developed, by, pixar, which, had, already, spun, off, from, industrial, light, magic, as, a, separate, entity, though, the, public, would, not, see, the, results, of, such, technological, progress, until, the, next, decade, in, the, late, 1980s, silicon, graphics, sgi, computers, were, used, to, create, some, of, the, first, fully, computer, generated, short, films, at, pixar, and, silicon, graphics, machines, were, considered, a, high, water, mark, for, the, field, during, the, decade, the, 1980s, is, also, called, the, golden, era, of, videogames, millions, selling, systems, from, atari, nintendo, and, sega, among, other, companies, exposed, computer, graphics, for, the, first, time, to, a, new, young, and, impressionable, audience, as, did, ms, dos, based, personal, computers, apple, iis, macs, and, amigas, all, of, which, also, allowed, users, to, program, their, own, games, if, skilled, enough, for, the, arcades, advances, were, made, in, commercial, real, time, 3d, graphics, in, 1988, the, first, dedicated, real, time, 3d, graphics, boards, were, introduced, for, arcades, with, the, namco, system, 21, and, taito, air, system, on, the, professional, side, evans, sutherland, and, sgi, developed, 3d, raster, graphics, hardware, that, directly, influenced, the, later, single, chip, graphics, processing, unit, gpu, a, technology, where, a, separate, and, very, powerful, chip, is, used, in, parallel, processing, with, a, cpu, to, optimize, graphics, the, decade, also, saw, computer, graphics, applied, to, many, additional, professional, markets, including, location, based, entertainment, and, education, with, the, e, s, digistar, vehicle, design, vehicle, simulation, and, chemistry, the, 1990s, overwhelming, note, was, the, emergence, of, 3d, modeling, on, a, mass, scale, and, an, impressive, rise, in, the, quality, of, cgi, generally, home, computers, became, able, to, take, on, rendering, tasks, that, previously, had, been, limited, to, workstations, costing, thousands, of, dollars, as, 3d, modelers, became, available, for, home, systems, the, popularity, of, silicon, graphics, workstations, declined, and, powerful, microsoft, windows, and, apple, macintosh, machines, running, autodesk, products, like, 3d, studio, or, other, home, rendering, software, ascended, in, importance, by, the, end, of, the, decade, the, gpu, would, begin, its, rise, to, the, prominence, it, still, enjoys, today, the, field, began, to, see, the, first, rendered, graphics, that, could, truly, pass, as, photorealistic, to, the, untrained, eye, though, they, could, not, yet, do, so, with, a, trained, cgi, artist, and, 3d, graphics, became, far, more, popular, in, gaming, multimedia, and, animation, at, the, end, of, the, 1980s, and, the, beginning, of, the, nineties, were, created, in, france, the, very, first, computer, graphics, tv, series, la, vie, des, b, tes, by, studio, mac, guff, ligne, 1988, les, fables, g, om, triques, 1989, 1991, by, studio, fant, me, and, quarxs, the, first, hdtv, computer, graphics, series, by, maurice, benayoun, and, fran, ois, schuiten, studio, z, a, production, 1990, 1993, in, film, pixar, began, its, serious, commercial, rise, in, this, era, under, edwin, catmull, with, its, first, major, film, release, in, 1995, toy, story, a, critical, and, commercial, success, of, nine, figure, magnitude, the, studio, to, invent, the, programmable, shader, would, go, on, to, have, many, animated, hits, and, its, work, on, prerendered, video, animation, is, still, considered, an, industry, leader, and, research, trail, breaker, in, video, games, in, 1992, virtua, racing, running, on, the, sega, model, 1, arcade, system, board, laid, the, foundations, for, fully, 3d, racing, games, and, popularized, real, time, 3d, polygonal, graphics, among, a, wider, audience, in, the, video, game, industry, the, sega, model, 2, in, 1993, and, sega, model, 3, in, 1996, subsequently, pushed, the, boundaries, of, commercial, real, time, 3d, graphics, back, on, the, pc, wolfenstein, 3d, doom, and, quake, three, of, the, first, massively, popular, 3d, first, person, shooter, games, were, released, by, id, software, to, critical, and, popular, acclaim, during, this, decade, using, a, rendering, engine, innovated, primarily, by, john, carmack, the, sony, playstation, sega, saturn, and, nintendo, 64, among, other, consoles, sold, in, the, millions, and, popularized, 3d, graphics, for, home, gamers, certain, late, 1990s, first, generation, 3d, titles, became, seen, as, influential, in, popularizing, 3d, graphics, among, console, users, such, as, platform, games, super, mario, 64, and, the, legend, of, zelda, ocarina, of, time, and, early, 3d, fighting, games, like, virtua, fighter, battle, arena, toshinden, and, tekken, technology, and, algorithms, for, rendering, continued, to, improve, greatly, in, 1996, krishnamurty, and, levoy, invented, normal, mapping, an, improvement, on, jim, blinn, s, bump, mapping, 1999, saw, nvidia, release, the, seminal, geforce, 256, the, first, home, video, card, billed, as, a, graphics, processing, unit, or, gpu, which, in, its, own, words, contained, integrated, transform, lighting, triangle, setup, clipping, and, rendering, engines, by, the, end, of, the, decade, computers, adopted, common, frameworks, for, graphics, processing, such, as, directx, and, opengl, since, then, computer, graphics, have, only, become, more, detailed, and, realistic, due, to, more, powerful, graphics, hardware, and, 3d, modeling, software, amd, also, became, a, leading, developer, of, graphics, boards, in, this, decade, creating, a, duopoly, in, the, field, which, exists, this, day, cgi, became, ubiquitous, in, earnest, during, this, era, video, games, and, cgi, cinema, had, spread, the, reach, of, computer, graphics, to, the, mainstream, by, the, late, 1990s, and, continued, to, do, so, at, an, accelerated, pace, in, the, 2000s, cgi, was, also, adopted, en, masse, for, television, advertisements, widely, in, the, late, 1990s, and, 2000s, and, so, became, familiar, to, a, massive, audience, the, continued, rise, and, increasing, sophistication, of, the, graphics, processing, unit, were, crucial, to, this, decade, and, 3d, rendering, capabilities, became, a, standard, feature, as, 3d, graphics, gpus, became, considered, a, necessity, for, desktop, computer, makers, to, offer, the, nvidia, geforce, line, of, graphics, cards, dominated, the, market, in, the, early, decade, with, occasional, significant, competing, presence, from, ati, as, the, decade, progressed, even, low, end, machines, usually, contained, a, 3d, capable, gpu, of, some, kind, as, nvidia, and, amd, both, introduced, low, priced, chipsets, and, continued, to, dominate, the, market, shaders, which, had, been, introduced, in, the, 1980s, to, perform, specialized, processing, on, the, gpu, would, by, the, end, of, the, decade, become, supported, on, most, consumer, hardware, speeding, up, graphics, considerably, and, allowing, for, greatly, improved, texture, and, shading, in, computer, graphics, via, the, widespread, adoption, of, normal, mapping, bump, mapping, and, a, variety, of, other, techniques, allowing, the, simulation, of, a, great, amount, of, detail, computer, graphics, used, in, films, and, video, games, gradually, began, to, be, realistic, to, the, point, of, entering, the, uncanny, valley, cgi, movies, proliferated, with, traditional, animated, cartoon, films, like, ice, age, and, madagascar, as, well, as, numerous, pixar, offerings, like, finding, nemo, dominating, the, box, office, in, this, field, the, final, fantasy, the, spirits, within, released, in, 2001, was, the, first, fully, computer, generated, feature, film, to, use, photorealistic, cgi, characters, and, be, fully, made, with, motion, capture, the, film, was, not, a, box, office, success, however, some, commentators, have, suggested, this, may, be, partly, because, the, lead, cgi, characters, had, facial, features, which, fell, into, the, uncanny, valley, other, animated, films, like, the, polar, express, drew, attention, at, this, time, as, well, star, wars, also, resurfaced, with, its, prequel, trilogy, and, the, effects, continued, to, set, a, bar, for, cgi, in, film, in, videogames, the, sony, playstation, 2, and, 3, the, microsoft, xbox, line, of, consoles, and, offerings, from, nintendo, such, as, the, gamecube, maintained, a, large, following, as, did, the, windows, pc, marquee, cgi, heavy, titles, like, the, series, of, grand, theft, auto, assassin, s, creed, final, fantasy, bioshock, kingdom, hearts, mirror, s, edge, and, dozens, of, others, continued, to, approach, photorealism, grow, the, video, game, industry, and, impress, until, that, industry, s, revenues, became, comparable, to, those, of, movies, microsoft, made, a, decision, to, expose, directx, more, easily, to, the, independent, developer, world, with, the, xna, program, but, it, was, not, a, success, directx, itself, remained, a, commercial, success, however, opengl, continued, to, mature, as, well, and, it, and, directx, improved, greatly, the, second, generation, shader, languages, hlsl, and, glsl, began, to, be, popular, in, this, decade, in, scientific, computing, the, gpgpu, technique, to, pass, large, amounts, of, data, bidirectionally, between, a, gpu, and, cpu, was, invented, speeding, up, analysis, on, many, kinds, of, bioinformatics, and, molecular, biology, experiments, the, technique, has, also, been, used, for, bitcoin, mining, and, has, applications, in, computer, vision, in, the, 2010s, cgi, has, been, nearly, ubiquitous, in, video, pre, rendered, graphics, are, nearly, scientifically, photorealistic, and, real, time, graphics, on, a, suitably, high, end, system, may, simulate, photorealism, to, the, untrained, eye, texture, mapping, has, matured, into, a, multistage, process, with, many, layers, generally, it, is, not, uncommon, to, implement, texture, mapping, bump, mapping, or, isosurfaces, or, normal, mapping, lighting, maps, including, specular, highlights, and, reflection, techniques, and, shadow, volumes, into, one, rendering, engine, using, shaders, which, are, maturing, considerably, shaders, are, now, very, nearly, a, necessity, for, advanced, work, in, the, field, providing, considerable, complexity, in, manipulating, pixels, vertices, and, textures, on, a, per, element, basis, and, countless, possible, effects, their, shader, languages, hlsl, and, glsl, are, active, fields, of, research, and, development, physically, based, rendering, or, pbr, which, implements, many, maps, and, performs, advanced, calculation, to, simulate, real, optic, light, flow, is, an, active, research, area, as, well, along, with, advanced, areas, like, ambient, occlusion, subsurface, scattering, rayleigh, scattering, photon, mapping, and, many, others, experiments, into, the, processing, power, required, to, provide, graphics, in, real, time, at, ultra, high, resolution, modes, like, 4k, ultra, hd, are, beginning, though, beyond, reach, of, all, but, the, highest, end, hardware, in, cinema, most, animated, movies, are, cgi, now, a, great, many, animated, cgi, films, are, made, per, year, but, few, if, any, attempt, photorealism, due, to, continuing, fears, of, the, uncanny, valley, most, are, 3d, cartoons, in, videogames, the, microsoft, xbox, one, sony, playstation, 4, and, nintendo, switch, dominated, the, home, space, and, were, all, capable, of, advanced, 3d, graphics, the, windows, pc, was, still, one, of, the, most, active, gaming, platforms, as, well, 2d, computer, graphics, are, the, computer, based, generation, of, digital, images, mostly, from, models, such, as, digital, image, and, by, techniques, specific, to, them, 2d, computer, graphics, are, mainly, used, in, applications, that, were, originally, developed, upon, traditional, printing, and, drawing, technologies, such, as, typography, in, those, applications, the, two, dimensional, image, is, not, just, a, representation, of, a, real, world, object, but, an, independent, artifact, with, added, semantic, value, two, dimensional, models, are, therefore, preferred, because, they, give, more, direct, control, of, the, image, than, 3d, computer, graphics, whose, approach, is, more, akin, to, photography, than, to, typography, a, large, form, of, digital, art, pixel, art, is, created, through, the, use, of, raster, graphics, software, where, images, are, edited, on, the, pixel, level, graphics, in, most, old, or, relatively, limited, computer, and, video, games, graphing, calculator, games, and, many, mobile, phone, games, are, mostly, pixel, art, a, sprite, is, a, two, dimensional, image, or, animation, that, is, integrated, into, a, larger, scene, initially, including, just, graphical, objects, handled, separately, from, the, memory, bitmap, of, a, video, display, this, now, includes, various, manners, of, graphical, overlays, originally, sprites, were, a, method, of, integrating, unrelated, bitmaps, so, that, they, appeared, to, be, part, of, the, normal, bitmap, on, a, screen, such, as, creating, an, animated, character, that, can, be, moved, on, a, screen, without, altering, the, data, defining, the, overall, screen, such, sprites, can, be, created, by, either, electronic, circuitry, or, software, in, circuitry, a, hardware, sprite, is, a, hardware, construct, that, employs, custom, dma, channels, to, integrate, visual, elements, with, the, main, screen, in, that, it, super, imposes, two, discrete, video, sources, software, can, simulate, this, through, specialized, rendering, methods, vector, graphics, formats, are, complementary, to, raster, graphics, raster, graphics, is, the, representation, of, images, as, an, array, of, pixels, and, is, typically, used, for, the, representation, of, photographic, images, vector, graphics, consists, of, encoding, information, about, shapes, and, colors, that, comprise, the, image, which, can, allow, for, more, flexibility, in, rendering, there, are, instances, when, working, with, vector, tools, and, formats, is, best, practice, and, instances, when, working, with, raster, tools, and, formats, is, best, practice, there, are, times, when, both, formats, come, together, an, understanding, of, the, advantages, and, limitations, of, each, technology, and, the, relationship, between, them, is, most, likely, to, result, in, efficient, and, effective, use, of, tools, since, the, mid, 2010s, as, a, result, of, advances, in, deep, neural, networks, models, have, been, created, which, take, as, input, a, natural, language, description, and, produces, as, output, an, image, matching, that, description, text, to, image, models, generally, combine, a, language, model, which, transforms, the, input, text, into, a, latent, representation, and, a, generative, image, model, which, produces, an, image, conditioned, on, that, representation, the, most, effective, models, have, generally, been, trained, on, massive, amounts, of, image, and, text, data, scraped, from, the, web, by, 2022, the, best, of, these, models, for, example, dall, e, 2, and, stable, diffusion, are, able, to, create, images, in, a, range, of, styles, ranging, from, imitations, of, living, artists, to, near, photorealistic, in, a, matter, of, seconds, given, powerful, enough, hardware, 3d, graphics, compared, to, 2d, graphics, are, graphics, that, use, a, three, dimensional, representation, of, geometric, data, for, the, purpose, of, performance, this, is, stored, in, the, computer, this, includes, images, that, may, be, for, later, display, or, for, real, time, viewing, despite, these, differences, 3d, computer, graphics, rely, on, similar, algorithms, as, 2d, computer, graphics, do, in, the, frame, and, raster, graphics, like, in, 2d, in, the, final, rendered, display, in, computer, graphics, software, the, distinction, between, 2d, and, 3d, is, occasionally, blurred, 2d, applications, may, use, 3d, techniques, to, achieve, effects, such, as, lighting, and, primarily, 3d, may, use, 2d, rendering, techniques, 3d, computer, graphics, are, the, same, as, 3d, models, the, model, is, contained, within, the, graphical, data, file, apart, from, the, rendering, however, there, are, differences, that, include, the, 3d, model, being, the, representation, of, any, 3d, object, until, visually, displayed, a, model, is, not, graphic, due, to, printing, 3d, models, are, not, only, confined, to, virtual, space, 3d, rendering, is, how, a, model, can, be, displayed, also, can, be, used, in, non, graphical, computer, simulations, and, calculations, computer, animation, is, the, art, of, creating, moving, images, via, the, use, of, computers, it, is, a, subfield, of, computer, graphics, and, animation, increasingly, it, is, created, by, means, of, 3d, computer, graphics, though, 2d, computer, graphics, are, still, widely, used, for, stylistic, low, bandwidth, and, faster, real, time, rendering, needs, sometimes, the, target, of, the, animation, is, the, computer, itself, but, sometimes, the, target, is, another, medium, such, as, film, it, is, also, referred, to, as, cgi, computer, generated, imagery, or, computer, generated, imaging, especially, when, used, in, films, virtual, entities, may, contain, and, be, controlled, by, assorted, attributes, such, as, transform, values, location, orientation, and, scale, stored, in, an, object, s, transformation, matrix, animation, is, the, change, of, an, attribute, over, time, multiple, methods, of, achieving, animation, exist, the, rudimentary, form, is, based, on, the, creation, and, editing, of, keyframes, each, storing, a, value, at, a, given, time, per, attribute, to, be, animated, the, 2d, 3d, graphics, software, will, change, with, each, keyframe, creating, an, editable, curve, of, a, value, mapped, over, time, in, which, results, in, animation, other, methods, of, animation, include, procedural, and, expression, based, techniques, the, former, consolidates, related, elements, of, animated, entities, into, sets, of, attributes, useful, for, creating, particle, effects, and, crowd, simulations, the, latter, allows, an, evaluated, result, returned, from, a, user, defined, logical, expression, coupled, with, mathematics, to, automate, animation, in, a, predictable, way, convenient, for, controlling, bone, behavior, beyond, what, a, hierarchy, offers, in, skeletal, system, set, up, to, create, the, illusion, of, movement, an, image, is, displayed, on, the, computer, screen, then, quickly, replaced, by, a, new, image, that, is, similar, to, the, previous, image, but, shifted, slightly, this, technique, is, identical, to, the, illusion, of, movement, in, television, and, motion, pictures, images, are, typically, created, by, devices, such, as, cameras, mirrors, lenses, telescopes, microscopes, etc, digital, images, include, both, vector, images, and, raster, images, but, raster, images, are, more, commonly, used, in, digital, imaging, a, pixel, or, picture, element, is, a, single, point, in, a, raster, image, pixels, are, placed, on, a, regular, 2, dimensional, grid, and, are, often, represented, using, dots, or, squares, each, pixel, is, a, sample, of, an, original, image, where, more, samples, typically, provide, a, more, accurate, representation, of, the, original, the, intensity, of, each, pixel, is, variable, in, color, systems, each, pixel, typically, has, three, subpixels, such, as, red, green, and, blue, graphics, are, visual, representations, on, a, surface, such, as, a, computer, screen, examples, are, photographs, drawing, graphics, designs, maps, engineering, drawings, or, other, images, graphics, often, combine, text, and, illustration, graphic, design, may, consist, of, the, deliberate, selection, creation, or, arrangement, of, typography, alone, as, in, a, brochure, flier, poster, web, site, or, book, without, any, other, element, clarity, or, effective, communication, may, be, the, objective, association, with, other, cultural, elements, may, be, sought, or, merely, the, creation, of, a, distinctive, style, primitives, are, basic, units, which, a, graphics, system, may, combine, to, create, more, complex, images, or, models, examples, would, be, sprites, and, character, maps, in, 2d, video, games, geometric, primitives, in, cad, or, polygons, or, triangles, in, 3d, rendering, primitives, may, be, supported, in, hardware, for, efficient, rendering, or, the, building, blocks, provided, by, a, graphics, application, rendering, is, the, generation, of, a, 2d, image, from, a, 3d, model, by, means, of, computer, programs, a, scene, file, contains, objects, in, a, strictly, defined, language, or, data, structure, it, would, contain, geometry, viewpoint, texturing, lighting, and, shading, information, as, a, description, of, the, virtual, scene, the, data, contained, in, the, scene, file, is, then, passed, to, a, rendering, program, to, be, processed, and, output, to, a, digital, image, or, raster, graphics, image, file, the, rendering, program, is, usually, built, into, the, computer, graphics, software, though, others, are, available, as, plug, ins, or, entirely, separate, programs, the, term, rendering, may, be, by, analogy, with, an, artist, s, rendering, of, a, scene, although, the, technical, details, of, rendering, methods, vary, the, general, challenges, to, overcome, in, producing, a, 2d, image, from, a, 3d, representation, stored, in, a, scene, file, are, outlined, as, the, graphics, pipeline, along, a, rendering, device, such, as, a, gpu, a, gpu, is, a, device, able, to, assist, the, cpu, in, calculations, if, a, scene, is, to, look, relatively, realistic, and, predictable, under, virtual, lighting, the, rendering, software, should, solve, the, rendering, equation, the, rendering, equation, does, not, account, for, all, lighting, phenomena, but, is, a, general, lighting, model, for, computer, generated, imagery, rendering, is, also, used, to, describe, the, process, of, calculating, effects, in, a, video, editing, file, to, produce, final, video, output, volume, rendering, is, a, technique, used, to, display, a, 2d, projection, of, a, 3d, discretely, sampled, data, set, a, typical, 3d, data, set, is, a, group, of, 2d, slice, images, acquired, by, a, ct, or, mri, scanner, usually, these, are, acquired, in, a, regular, pattern, e, g, one, slice, every, millimeter, and, usually, have, a, regular, number, of, image, pixels, in, a, regular, pattern, this, is, an, example, of, a, regular, volumetric, grid, with, each, volume, element, or, voxel, represented, by, a, single, value, that, is, obtained, by, sampling, the, immediate, area, surrounding, the, voxel, 3d, modeling, is, the, process, of, developing, a, mathematical, wireframe, representation, of, any, three, dimensional, object, called, a, 3d, model, via, specialized, software, models, may, be, created, automatically, or, manually, the, manual, modeling, process, of, preparing, geometric, data, for, 3d, computer, graphics, is, similar, to, plastic, arts, such, as, sculpting, 3d, models, may, be, created, using, multiple, approaches, use, of, nurbs, to, generate, accurate, and, smooth, surface, patches, polygonal, mesh, modeling, manipulation, of, faceted, geometry, or, polygonal, mesh, subdivision, advanced, tessellation, of, polygons, resulting, in, smooth, surfaces, similar, to, nurb, models, a, 3d, model, can, be, displayed, as, a, two, dimensional, image, through, a, process, called, 3d, rendering, used, in, a, computer, simulation, of, physical, phenomena, or, animated, directly, for, other, purposes, the, model, can, also, be, physically, created, using, 3d, printing, devices, the, study, of, computer, graphics, is, a, sub, field, of, computer, science, which, studies, methods, for, digitally, synthesizing, and, manipulating, visual, content, although, the, term, often, refers, to, three, dimensional, computer, graphics, it, also, encompasses, two, dimensional, graphics, and, image, processing, as, an, academic, discipline, computer, graphics, studies, the, manipulation, of, visual, and, geometric, information, using, computational, techniques, it, focuses, on, the, mathematical, and, computational, foundations, of, image, generation, and, processing, rather, than, purely, aesthetic, issues, computer, graphics, is, often, differentiated, from, the, field, of, visualization, although, the, two, fields, have, many, similarities, computer, graphics, may, be, used, in, the, following, areas
