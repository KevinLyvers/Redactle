https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxophone
the, saxophone, often, referred, to, colloquially, as, the, sax, is, a, type, of, single, reed, woodwind, instrument, with, a, conical, body, usually, made, of, brass, as, with, all, single, reed, instruments, sound, is, produced, when, a, reed, on, a, mouthpiece, vibrates, to, produce, a, sound, wave, inside, the, instrument, s, body, the, pitch, is, controlled, by, opening, and, closing, holes, in, the, body, to, change, the, effective, length, of, the, tube, the, holes, are, closed, by, leather, pads, attached, to, keys, operated, by, the, player, saxophones, are, made, in, various, sizes, and, are, almost, always, treated, as, transposing, instruments, a, person, who, plays, the, saxophone, is, called, a, saxophonist, or, saxist, the, saxophone, is, used, in, a, wide, range, of, musical, styles, including, classical, music, such, as, concert, bands, chamber, music, solo, repertoire, and, occasionally, orchestras, military, bands, marching, bands, jazz, such, as, big, bands, and, jazz, combos, and, contemporary, music, the, saxophone, is, also, used, as, a, solo, and, melody, instrument, or, as, a, member, of, a, horn, section, in, some, styles, of, rock, and, roll, and, popular, music, the, saxophone, was, invented, by, the, belgian, instrument, maker, adolphe, sax, in, the, early, 1840s, and, was, patented, on, 28, june, 1846, sax, invented, two, groups, of, seven, instruments, each, one, group, contained, instruments, in, c, and, f, and, the, other, group, contained, instruments, in, b, and, e, the, b, and, e, instruments, soon, became, dominant, and, most, saxophones, encountered, today, are, from, this, series, instruments, from, the, series, pitched, in, c, and, f, never, gained, a, foothold, and, constituted, only, a, small, fraction, of, instruments, made, by, sax, high, pitch, also, marked, h, or, hp, saxophones, tuned, sharper, than, the, concert, a, 440, hz, standard, were, produced, into, the, early, twentieth, century, for, sonic, qualities, suited, for, outdoor, use, but, are, not, playable, to, modern, tuning, and, are, considered, obsolete, low, pitch, also, marked, l, or, lp, saxophones, are, equivalent, in, tuning, to, modern, instruments, c, soprano, and, c, melody, saxophones, were, produced, for, the, casual, market, as, parlor, instruments, during, the, early, twentieth, century, and, saxophones, in, f, were, introduced, during, the, late, 1920s, but, never, gained, acceptance, the, modern, saxophone, family, consists, entirely, of, b, and, e, instruments, the, saxophones, in, widest, use, are, the, b, soprano, e, alto, b, tenor, and, e, baritone, the, e, sopranino, and, b, bass, saxophone, are, typically, used, in, larger, saxophone, choir, settings, when, available, in, the, table, below, consecutive, members, of, each, family, are, pitched, an, octave, apart, the, pitch, of, a, saxophone, is, controlled, by, opening, or, closing, the, tone, holes, along, the, body, of, the, instrument, to, change, the, length, of, the, vibrating, air, column, the, tone, holes, are, closed, by, leather, pads, connected, to, keys, most, are, operated, by, the, player, s, fingers, but, some, are, operated, using, the, palm, or, the, side, of, a, finger, there, is, an, octave, key, which, raises, the, pitch, of, the, lower, notes, by, one, octave, the, lowest, note, on, most, modern, saxophones, is, the, written, b, below, middle, c, nearly, all, baritone, saxophones, are, now, constructed, with, an, extra, key, to, allow, them, to, play, low, a, and, a, small, number, of, altos, with, a, low, a, key, have, been, manufactured, the, highest, keyed, note, has, traditionally, been, the, f, two, and, a, half, octaves, above, the, low, b, but, many, instruments, now, have, an, extra, key, for, a, high, f, and, some, modern, soprano, saxophones, even, have, a, high, g, key, notes, above, this, are, part, of, the, altissimo, register, and, require, advanced, embouchure, techniques, and, fingering, combinations, saxophone, music, is, written, in, treble, clef, appropriately, transposed, for, each, different, type, of, instrument, and, all, saxophones, use, the, same, key, arrangement, and, fingerings, therefore, any, written, note, corresponds, to, the, same, fingering, on, any, saxophone, making, it, easier, for, players, to, switch, instruments, alto, and, larger, saxophones, have, a, detachable, curved, neck, at, the, top, and, a, u, shaped, bend, the, bow, that, turns, the, tubing, upward, as, it, approaches, the, bell, soprano, and, sopranino, saxophones, are, usually, constructed, without, a, detachable, neck, or, a, bow, but, some, have, a, small, detachable, neck, and, some, are, shaped, like, an, alto, saxophone, with, a, bow, section, there, are, rare, examples, of, alto, tenor, and, baritone, saxophones, with, mostly, straight, bodies, baritone, bass, and, contrabass, saxophones, have, extra, bends, to, accommodate, the, length, of, tubing, the, fingering, system, for, the, saxophone, is, similar, to, the, systems, used, for, the, oboe, the, boehm, system, clarinet, and, the, flute, from, the, earliest, days, of, the, saxophone, the, body, and, key, cups, have, been, made, from, sheet, brass, stock, which, can, be, worked, into, complex, shapes, the, keywork, is, manufactured, from, other, types, of, brass, stock, king, made, saxophones, with, necks, and, bells, of, sterling, silver, from, the, 1930s, into, the, early, 1960s, yanagisawa, revived, this, idea, in, the, 1980s, and, later, introduced, instruments, entirely, made, of, sterling, silver, keilwerth, and, p, mauriat, have, used, nickel, silver, a, copper, nickel, zinc, alloy, more, commonly, used, for, flutes, for, the, bodies, of, some, saxophone, models, for, visual, and, tonal, effect, higher, copper, variants, of, brass, are, sometimes, substituted, for, the, more, common, yellow, brass, and, cartridge, brass, yanagisawa, made, its, 902, and, 992, series, saxophones, with, the, high, copper, alloy, phosphor, bronze, to, achieve, a, darker, more, vintage, tone, than, the, brass, 901, and, 991, models, other, materials, are, used, for, some, mechanical, parts, and, keywork, buttons, where, the, fingers, contact, the, keys, are, usually, made, from, plastic, or, mother, of, pearl, rods, screw, pins, and, springs, are, usually, made, of, blued, or, stainless, steel, mechanical, buffers, of, felt, cork, leather, and, various, synthetic, materials, are, used, to, minimize, mechanical, noise, from, key, movement, and, to, optimize, the, action, of, the, keywork, nickel, silver, is, sometimes, used, for, hinges, for, its, advantages, of, mechanical, durability, although, the, most, common, material, for, such, applications, has, remained, brass, manufacturers, usually, apply, a, finish, to, the, surface, of, the, instrument, s, body, and, keywork, the, most, common, finish, is, a, thin, coating, of, clear, or, colored, acrylic, lacquer, to, protect, the, brass, from, oxidation, and, maintain, a, shiny, appearance, silver, or, gold, plating, are, offered, as, options, on, some, models, some, silver, plated, saxophones, are, also, lacquered, plating, saxophones, with, gold, is, an, expensive, process, because, an, underplating, of, silver, is, required, for, the, gold, to, adhere, to, nickel, plating, has, been, used, on, the, bodies, of, early, budget, model, saxophones, and, is, commonly, used, on, keywork, when, a, more, durable, finish, is, desired, mostly, with, student, model, saxophones, chemical, surface, treatment, of, the, base, metal, has, come, into, use, as, an, alternative, to, the, lacquer, and, plating, finishes, in, recent, years, the, saxophone, uses, a, single, reed, mouthpiece, similar, to, that, of, the, clarinet, each, size, of, saxophone, alto, tenor, etc, uses, a, different, size, of, reed, and, mouthpiece, most, saxophonists, use, reeds, made, from, arundo, donax, cane, but, since, the, middle, of, the, twentieth, century, some, have, been, made, of, fiberglass, or, other, composite, materials, saxophone, reeds, are, proportioned, slightly, differently, from, clarinet, reeds, being, wider, for, the, same, length, commercial, reeds, vary, in, hardness, and, design, and, single, reed, players, try, different, reeds, to, find, those, that, suit, their, mouthpiece, embouchure, and, playing, style, mouthpiece, design, has, a, profound, impact, on, tone, different, mouthpiece, design, characteristics, and, features, tend, to, be, favored, for, different, styles, early, mouthpieces, were, designed, to, produce, a, warm, and, round, sound, for, classical, playing, among, classical, mouthpieces, those, with, a, concave, excavated, chamber, are, truer, to, adolphe, sax, s, original, design, these, provide, a, softer, or, less, piercing, tone, favored, by, the, rasch, r, school, of, classical, playing, saxophonists, who, follow, the, french, school, of, classical, playing, influenced, by, marcel, mule, generally, use, mouthpieces, with, smaller, chambers, for, a, somewhat, brighter, sound, with, relatively, more, upper, harmonics, the, use, of, the, saxophone, in, dance, orchestras, and, jazz, ensembles, from, the, 1920s, onward, placed, emphasis, on, dynamic, range, and, projection, leading, to, innovation, in, mouthpiece, designs, at, the, opposite, extreme, from, the, classical, mouthpieces, are, those, with, a, small, chamber, and, a, low, clearance, above, the, reed, between, the, tip, and, the, chamber, called, high, baffle, these, produce, a, bright, sound, with, maximum, projection, suitable, for, having, a, sound, stand, out, among, amplified, instruments, mouthpieces, come, in, a, wide, variety, of, materials, including, vulcanized, rubber, sometimes, called, hard, rubber, or, ebonite, plastic, and, metals, like, bronze, or, surgical, steel, less, common, materials, that, have, been, used, include, wood, glass, crystal, porcelain, and, bone, recently, delrin, has, been, added, to, the, stock, of, mouthpiece, materials, the, effect, of, mouthpiece, materials, on, tone, of, the, saxophone, has, been, the, subject, of, much, debate, according, to, larry, teal, the, mouthpiece, material, has, little, if, any, effect, on, the, sound, and, the, physical, dimensions, give, a, mouthpiece, its, tone, color, there, are, examples, of, dark, sounding, metal, pieces, and, bright, sounding, hard, rubber, pieces, the, extra, bulk, required, near, the, tip, with, hard, rubber, affects, mouth, position, and, airflow, characteristics, the, saxophone, was, designed, around, 1840, by, adolphe, sax, a, belgian, instrument, maker, flautist, and, clarinetist, born, in, dinant, and, originally, based, in, brussels, he, moved, to, paris, in, 1842, to, establish, his, musical, instrument, business, before, working, on, the, saxophone, he, made, several, improvements, to, the, bass, clarinet, by, improving, its, keywork, and, acoustics, and, extending, its, lower, range, sax, was, also, a, maker, of, the, ophicleide, a, large, conical, brass, instrument, in, the, bass, register, with, keys, similar, to, a, woodwind, instrument, his, experience, with, these, two, instruments, allowed, him, to, develop, the, skills, and, technologies, needed, to, make, the, first, saxophones, as, an, outgrowth, of, his, work, improving, the, bass, clarinet, sax, began, developing, an, instrument, with, the, projection, of, a, brass, instrument, and, the, agility, of, a, woodwind, he, wanted, it, to, overblow, at, the, octave, unlike, the, clarinet, which, rises, in, pitch, by, a, twelfth, when, overblown, an, instrument, that, overblows, at, the, octave, has, identical, fingering, for, both, registers, sax, created, an, instrument, with, a, single, reed, mouthpiece, and, conical, brass, body, having, constructed, saxophones, in, several, sizes, in, the, early, 1840s, sax, applied, for, and, received, a, 15, year, patent, for, the, instrument, on, 28, june, 1846, the, patent, encompassed, 14, versions, of, the, fundamental, design, split, into, two, categories, of, seven, instruments, each, and, ranging, from, sopranino, to, contrabass, a, limited, number, of, instruments, in, the, series, pitched, in, f, and, c, were, produced, by, sax, but, the, series, pitched, in, e, and, b, quickly, became, the, standard, all, the, instruments, were, given, an, initial, written, range, from, the, b, below, the, treble, staff, to, the, e, one, half, step, below, the, third, ledger, line, above, staff, giving, each, saxophone, a, range, of, two, and, a, half, octaves, sax, s, patent, expired, in, 1866, thereafter, numerous, other, instrument, manufacturers, implemented, their, own, improvements, to, the, design, and, keywork, sax, s, original, keywork, which, was, based, on, the, triebert, system, 3, oboe, for, the, left, hand, and, the, boehm, clarinet, for, the, right, was, simplistic, and, made, certain, legato, passages, and, wide, intervals, extremely, difficult, to, finger, that, system, was, later, improved, with, extra, keys, linkage, mechanisms, and, alternate, fingerings, early, in, the, development, of, the, saxophone, the, upper, keyed, range, was, extended, to, e, then, to, f, above, the, staff, 1880s, era, sheet, music, for, saxophone, was, written, for, the, range, of, low, b, to, f, in, 1887, the, buffet, crampon, company, obtained, a, patent, for, extending, the, bell, and, adding, an, extra, key, to, extend, the, range, downwards, by, one, semitone, to, b, this, extension, is, standard, in, modern, designs, with, the, notable, exception, of, baritone, saxophones, which, have, keys, down, to, low, a, the, upper, range, to, f, remained, the, standard, for, nearly, a, century, until, a, high, f, key, became, common, on, modern, saxophones, in, the, 1840s, and, 1850s, sax, s, invention, gained, use, in, small, classical, ensembles, both, all, saxophone, and, mixed, as, a, solo, instrument, and, in, french, and, british, military, bands, saxophone, method, books, were, published, and, saxophone, instruction, was, offered, at, conservatories, in, france, switzerland, belgium, spain, and, italy, by, 1856, the, french, garde, republicaine, band, was, the, largest, ensemble, of, its, time, to, prominently, feature, the, instrument, using, eight, saxophones, the, saxophone, was, used, experimentally, in, orchestral, scores, but, never, came, into, widespread, use, as, an, orchestral, instrument, in, 1853, 54, the, orchestra, of, louis, antoine, jullien, featured, a, soprano, saxophone, on, a, concert, tour, of, the, united, states, after, an, early, period, of, interest, and, support, from, classical, music, communities, in, europe, interest, in, the, saxophone, as, a, classical, instrument, waned, in, the, late, nineteenth, century, saxophone, teaching, at, the, paris, conservatory, was, suspended, from, 1870, to, 1900, and, classical, saxophone, repertoire, stagnated, during, that, period, but, it, was, during, this, same, period, that, the, saxophone, began, to, be, promoted, in, the, united, states, largely, through, the, efforts, of, patrick, gilmore, leader, of, the, 22nd, regiment, band, and, edward, a, lefebre, a, dutch, emigr, and, saxophonist, who, had, family, business, associations, with, sax, lefebre, settled, in, new, york, in, early, 1872, after, he, arrived, as, a, clarinetist, with, a, british, opera, company, gilmore, organized, the, world, peace, jubilee, and, international, music, festival, taking, place, in, boston, that, summer, the, garde, republicaine, band, performed, and, lefebre, was, a, clarinetist, with, the, great, festival, orchestra, for, that, event, in, the, fall, of, 1873, gilmore, was, reorganizing, the, 22nd, regiment, band, under, the, influence, of, the, garde, republicaine, band, and, recruited, lefebre, who, had, established, a, reputation, in, new, york, as, a, saxophonist, over, the, previous, year, gilmore, s, band, soon, featured, a, soprano, alto, tenor, baritone, saxophone, section, which, also, performed, as, a, quartet, the, gilmore, lefebre, association, lasted, until, gilmore, s, death, in, 1892, during, which, time, lefebre, also, performed, in, smaller, ensembles, of, various, sizes, and, instrumentation, and, worked, with, composers, to, increase, light, classical, and, popular, repertoire, for, saxophone, lefebre, s, later, promotional, efforts, were, very, significant, in, broadening, adoption, of, the, saxophone, starting, near, the, end, of, the, 1880s, he, consulted, with, the, brass, instrument, manufacturer, c, g, conn, to, develop, and, start, production, of, improved, saxophones, to, replace, the, costly, scarce, and, mechanically, unreliable, european, instruments, that, were, in, the, american, market, the, early, 1890s, saw, regular, production, of, saxophones, commence, at, conn, and, its, offshoot, buescher, manufacturing, company, which, dramatically, increased, availability, of, saxophones, in, the, us, lefebre, worked, with, the, music, publisher, carl, fischer, to, distribute, his, transcriptions, arrangements, and, original, works, for, saxophone, and, worked, with, the, conn, conservatory, to, further, saxophone, pedagogy, in, the, us, lefebre, s, associations, with, conn, and, fischer, lasted, into, the, first, decade, of, the, twentieth, century, and, fischer, continued, to, publish, new, arrangements, of, lefebre, s, works, after, his, death, while, the, saxophone, remained, marginal, used, mainly, as, a, novelty, instrument, in, the, classical, world, many, new, musical, niches, were, established, for, it, during, the, early, decades, of, the, twentieth, century, its, early, use, in, vaudeville, and, ragtime, bands, around, the, turn, of, the, century, laid, the, groundwork, for, its, use, in, dance, orchestras, and, eventually, jazz, as, the, market, for, saxophones, grew, in, the, us, the, manufacturing, industry, grew, the, martin, band, instrument, company, started, producing, saxophones, between, 1905, and, 1912, and, the, cleveland, band, instrument, company, started, producing, saxophones, under, contract, to, the, h, n, white, company, in, 1916, the, saxophone, was, promoted, for, the, casual, market, with, introduction, of, the, c, soprano, slightly, higher, than, the, regular, soprano, and, c, melody, between, alto, and, tenor, saxophones, both, pitched, in, c, to, enable, them, to, play, from, piano, music, production, of, such, instruments, stopped, during, the, great, depression, during, the, 1920s, the, saxophone, came, into, use, as, a, jazz, instrument, fostered, by, the, influences, of, the, fletcher, henderson, orchestra, and, the, duke, ellington, orchestra, starting, in, the, late, 1920s, and, early, 1930s, the, modern, era, of, classical, saxophone, was, launched, largely, through, the, efforts, of, marcel, mule, and, sigurd, rasch, r, and, the, classical, repertoire, for, the, instrument, expanded, rapidly, the, use, of, the, saxophone, for, more, dynamic, and, more, technically, demanding, styles, of, playing, added, incentive, for, improvements, in, keywork, and, acoustic, design, early, saxophones, had, two, separate, octave, keys, operated, by, the, left, thumb, to, control, the, two, octave, vents, required, on, alto, or, larger, saxophones, around, the, turn, of, the, century, mechanisms, were, developed, to, operate, both, octave, vents, with, a, single, key, using, the, left, thumb, ergonomic, design, of, keywork, evolved, rapidly, during, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, the, front, f, mechanism, supporting, alternate, fingerings, for, high, e, and, f, and, a, stack, linked, g, key, action, became, standard, during, the, 1920s, followed, by, improvements, to, the, left, hand, table, key, mechanisms, controlling, g, and, the, bell, keys, new, bore, designs, during, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, resulted, from, the, quest, for, improved, intonation, dynamic, response, and, tonal, qualities, the, 1920s, were, also, an, era, of, design, experiments, like, the, buescher, straight, altos, and, tenors, the, king, saxello, soprano, the, c, g, conn, mezzo, soprano, saxophone, keyed, in, f, and, the, conn, o, sax, saxophone, english, horn, hybrid, french, saxophonist, and, educator, jean, marie, londeix, greatly, expanded, the, saxophone, repertoire, and, available, techniques, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, commissioning, a, great, deal, of, new, saxophone, works, with, extended, techniques, including, those, by, denisov, lauba, ross, and, rolin, the, modern, layout, of, the, saxophone, emerged, during, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, first, with, right, side, bell, keys, introduced, by, c, g, conn, on, baritones, then, by, king, on, altos, and, tenors, the, mechanics, of, the, left, hand, table, were, revolutionized, by, selmer, with, their, balanced, action, instruments, in, 1936, capitalizing, on, the, right, side, bell, key, layout, in, 1948, selmer, introduced, their, super, action, saxophones, with, offset, left, and, right, hand, stack, keys, thirty, to, forty, years, later, this, 1948, selmer, layout, was, nearly, universal, the, high, f, key, was, also, first, introduced, as, an, option, on, the, balanced, action, model, although, it, took, several, decades, for, it, to, gain, acceptance, because, of, perceived, deleterious, effects, on, intonation, marcel, mule, established, study, of, the, saxophone, as, a, classical, instrument, at, the, conservatoire, de, paris, from, the, 1940s, larry, teal, did, the, same, in, the, united, states, at, the, university, of, michigan, a, decade, later, a, number, of, other, american, institutions, have, since, become, recognized, homes, for, the, study, of, classical, saxophone, they, include, northwestern, university, indiana, university, and, the, eastman, school, of, music, the, saxophone, first, gained, popularity, in, military, bands, although, the, instrument, was, initially, ignored, in, germany, french, and, belgian, military, bands, were, quick, to, include, it, in, their, ensembles, most, french, and, belgian, military, bands, incorporate, at, least, a, quartet, of, saxophones, comprising, an, e, baritone, b, tenor, e, alto, and, b, soprano, these, four, instruments, have, proven, the, most, popular, of, all, sax, s, creations, with, the, e, contrabass, and, b, bass, usually, considered, impractically, large, and, e, sopranino, insufficiently, powerful, british, military, bands, tend, to, include, at, minimum, two, saxophonists, on, alto, and, tenor, the, saxophone, was, introduced, into, the, concert, band, which, usually, calls, for, an, e, alto, saxophone, a, b, tenor, saxophone, and, an, e, baritone, saxophone, a, concert, band, may, include, two, altos, one, tenor, and, one, baritone, a, b, soprano, saxophone, is, also, sometimes, used, and, is, played, by, the, first, alto, saxophonist, a, bass, saxophone, in, b, is, used, in, some, concert, band, music, especially, music, by, percy, grainger, saxophones, are, used, in, chamber, music, such, as, saxophone, quartets, and, other, chamber, combinations, of, instruments, the, classical, saxophone, quartet, consists, of, a, b, soprano, saxophone, e, alto, saxophone, b, tenor, saxophone, and, e, baritone, saxophone, satb, on, occasion, the, soprano, is, replaced, with, a, second, alto, sax, aatb, a, few, professional, saxophone, quartets, have, featured, non, standard, instrumentation, such, as, james, fei, s, alto, quartet, four, altos, there, is, a, repertoire, of, classical, compositions, and, arrangements, for, the, satb, instrumentation, dating, back, to, the, nineteenth, century, particularly, by, french, composers, who, knew, sax, however, the, largest, body, of, chamber, works, for, saxophone, are, from, the, modern, era, of, classical, saxophone, initiated, by, marcel, mule, in, 1928, sigurd, rasch, r, followed, as, a, soloist, in, orchestral, works, starting, in, 1931, and, also, figured, prominently, in, development, of, modern, classical, saxophone, repertoire, the, mule, quartet, is, often, considered, the, prototype, for, quartets, due, to, the, level, of, virtuosity, demonstrated, by, its, members, and, its, central, role, in, the, development, of, modern, quartet, repertoire, however, organized, quartets, existed, before, mule, s, ensemble, the, prime, example, being, the, quartet, headed, by, edward, a, lefebre, 1834, 1911, which, was, a, subset, of, patrick, gilmore, s, 22nd, regiment, band, between, 1873, and, 1893, in, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, the, saxophone, found, increased, popularity, in, symphony, orchestras, the, instrument, has, also, been, used, in, opera, and, choral, music, musical, theatre, scores, also, can, include, parts, for, saxophone, sometimes, doubling, another, woodwind, or, brass, instrument, coincident, with, the, more, widespread, availability, of, saxophones, in, the, us, around, the, turn, of, the, century, was, the, rise, of, ragtime, music, the, bands, featuring, the, syncopated, african, american, rhythmic, influences, of, ragtime, were, an, exciting, new, feature, of, the, american, cultural, landscape, and, provided, the, groundwork, for, new, styles, of, dancing, two, of, the, best, known, ragtime, playing, brass, bands, with, saxophones, were, those, led, by, w, c, handy, and, james, r, europe, europe, s, 369th, infantry, regiment, band, popularized, ragtime, in, france, during, its, 1918, tour, the, rise, of, dance, bands, into, the, 1920s, followed, from,

public, to, the, saxophone, rudy, wiedoeft, became, the, best, known, individual, saxophone, stylist, and, virtuoso, during, this, period, leading, into, the, saxophone, craze, of, the, 1920s, following, it, the, saxophone, became, featured, in, music, as, diverse, as, the, sweet, music, of, paul, whiteman, and, guy, lombardo, jazz, swing, and, large, stage, show, bands, the, rise, of, the, saxophone, as, a, jazz, instrument, followed, its, widespread, adoption, in, dance, bands, during, the, early, 1920s, the, fletcher, henderson, orchestra, formed, in, 1923, featured, arrangements, to, back, up, improvisation, bringing, the, first, elements, of, jazz, to, the, large, dance, band, format, following, the, innovations, of, the, fletcher, henderson, orchestra, the, duke, ellington, orchestra, and, jean, goldkette, s, victor, recording, orchestra, featured, jazz, solos, with, saxophones, and, other, instruments, the, association, of, dance, bands, with, jazz, would, reach, its, peak, with, the, swing, music, of, the, 1930s, the, large, show, band, format, influenced, by, the, 1930s, swing, bands, would, be, used, as, backing, for, popular, vocalists, and, stage, shows, in,

show, that, featured, bands, led, by, doc, severinsen, and, branford, marsalis, and, las, vegas, stage, shows, the, swing, era, fostered, the, later, saxophone, styles, that, permeated, bebop, and, rhythm, and, blues, in, the, early, postwar, era, coleman, hawkins, established, the, tenor, saxophone, as, a, jazz, solo, instrument, during, his, stint, with, fletcher, henderson, from, 1923, to, 1934, hawkins, arpeggiated, rich, toned, vibrato, laden, style, was, the, main, influence, on, swing, era, tenor, players, before, lester, young, and, his, influence, continued, with, other, big, toned, tenor, players, into, the, era, of, modern, jazz, among, the, tenor, players, directly, influenced, by, him, were, chu, berry, charlie, barnet, tex, beneke, ben, webster, vido, musso, herschel,

during, the, 1920s, but, the, instrument, did, not, come, into, wide, use, until, the, modern, era, of, jazz, as, chicago, style, jazz, evolved, from, new, orleans, jazz, in, the, 1920s, one, of, its, defining, features, was, the, addition, of, saxophones, to, the, ensemble, the, small, chicago, ensembles, offered, more, improvisational, freedom, than, did, the, new, orleans, or, large, band, formats, fostering, the, innovations, of, saxophonists, jimmy, dorsey, alto, frankie, trumbauer, c, melody, bud, freeman, tenor, and, stump, evans, baritone, dorsey, and, trumbauer, became, important, influences, on, tenor, saxophonist, lester, young, lester, young, s, approach, on, tenor, saxophone, differed, from, hawkins, emphasizing, more, melodic, linear, playing, that, wove, in, and, out, of,

hawkins, 1939, recording, of, body, and, soul, marked, the, saxophone, as, an, influence, on, jazz, equal, to, the, trumpet, which, had, been, the, defining, instrument, of, jazz, since, its, beginnings, in, new, orleans, but, the, greatest, influence, of, the, saxophone, on, jazz, was, to, occur, a, few, years, later, when, alto, saxophonist, charlie, parker, became, an, icon, of, the, bebop, revolution, that, influenced, generations, of, jazz, musicians, the, small, group, format, of, bebop, and, post, bebop, jazz, ensembles, gained, ascendancy, in, the, 1940s, as, musicians, used, the, harmonic, and, melodic, freedom, pioneered, by, parker, dizzy, gillespie, thelonious, monk, and, bud, powell, in, extended, jazz, solos, during, the, 1950s, prominent, alto, players, included,

and, free, jazz, were, explored, with, every, device, that, saxophonists, could, conceive, of, sheets, of, sound, tonal, exploration, upper, harmonics, and, multiphonics, were, hallmarks, of, the, creative, possibilities, that, saxophones, offered, one, lasting, influence, of, the, avant, garde, movement, is, the, exploration, of, non, western, ethnic, sounds, on, the, saxophone, for, example, the, african, influenced, sounds, used, by, sanders, and, the, indian, influenced, sounds, used, by, coltrane, the, devices, of, the, avant, garde, movement, have, continued, to, be, influential, in, music, that, challenges, the, boundaries, between, avant, garde, and, other, categories, of, jazz, such, as, that, of, alto, saxophonists, steve, coleman, and, greg, osby, some, ensembles, such, as,

instruments, have, appeared, since, sax, s, original, work, most, with, no, lasting, impact, during, the, early, 1920s, reiffel, husted, of, chicago, produced, a, slide, soprano, saxophone, during, the, 1920s, some, straight, alto, and, tenor, saxophones, were, produced, by, buescher, which, proved, cumbersome, to, handle, and, more, difficult, to, transport, buescher, custom, produced, one, straight, baritone, saxophone, as, novelty, instrument, for, a, vaudeville, performer, c, g, conn, introduced, two, new, variants, in, 1928, 1929, the, conn, o, sax, and, the, mezzo, soprano, saxophone, both, keyed, in, f, one, step, above, the, e, alto, the, conn, o, sax, is, built, straight, with, a, slightly, curved, neck, a, spherical, liebesfuss, style, bell, and, extra, keys, for, low, a, and, up, to, high, g, it, was, produced, only, in, 1929, and, 1930, and, intended, to, imitate, the, form, and, timbre, of, the, cor, anglais, with, fewer, than, 100, surviving, instruments, the, conn, o, sax, is, highly, sought, after, by, collectors, the, conn, mezzo, soprano, experienced, a, similarly, short, production, run, as, the, economics, of, the, great, depression, curtailed, the, market, for, what, were, regarded, as, novelty, instruments, most, were, subsequently, expended, by, conn, to, train, its, repair, technicians, the, most, successful, of, the, unusual, 1920s, designs, was, the, king, saxello, essentially, a, straight, b, soprano, but, with, a, slightly, curved, neck, and, tipped, bell, made, by, the, h, n, white, company, such, instruments, now, command, prices, up, to, us, 4, 000, its, lasting, influence, is, shown, in, the, number, of, companies, including, keilwerth, rampone, cazzani, altello, model, l, a, sax, and, sax, dakota, usa, marketing, straight, bore, tipped, bell, soprano, saxophones, as, saxellos, or, saxello, sopranos, interest, in, two, 1920s, variants, was, revived, by, jazz, musician, rahsaan, roland, kirk, who, called, his, straight, buescher, alto, a, stritch, and, his, saxello, a, manzello, the, buescher, straight, alto, was, a, production, instrument, while, the, manzello, was, in, fact, a, saxello, with, a, custom, made, large, bell, and, modified, keywork, more, recently, the, mezzo, soprano, or, a, modern, variant, of, it, came, into, use, by, jazz, musicians, anthony, braxton, james, carter, vinny, golia, and, joe, lovano, some, of, the, 1920s, experimental, designs, in, addition, to, the, saxello, provide, the, basis, for, similar, instruments, produced, during, the, modern, era, straight, altos, and, tenors, have, been, revived, by, keilwerth, l, a, sax, and, sax, dakota, usa, a, mezzo, soprano, in, the, key, of, g, has, been, produced, by, danish, woodwind, technician, peter, jessen, most, notably, played, by, joe, lovano, this, instrument, is, more, in, the, timbral, quality, of, bb, soprano, saxophone, the, contralto, saxophone, similar, in, size, to, the, orchestral, c, melody, was, developed, in, the, late, 20th, century, by, california, instrument, maker, jim, schmidt, this, instrument, has, a, larger, bore, and, a, new, fingering, system, and, does, not, resemble, the, orchestral, instrument, except, for, its, key, and, register, benedikt, eppelsheim, of, munich, germany, has, introduced, recent, innovations, at, the, upper, and, lower, ends, of, the, saxophone, range, the, soprillo, sax, is, a, piccolo, sized, saxophone, pitched, an, octave, higher, than, the, b, soprano, sax, it, is, so, small, that, the, octave, key, is, built, into, the, mouthpiece, the, tubax, developed, in, 1999, by, eppelsheim, plays, the, same, range, and, with, the, same, fingering, as, the, e, contrabass, saxophone, its, bore, however, is, narrower, than, that, of, a, contrabass, resulting, in, a, more, compact, instrument, with, a, reedier, tone, akin, to, the, double, reed, contrabass, sarrusophone, it, can, be, played, with, the, smaller, and, more, commonly, available, baritone, saxophone, mouthpiece, and, reeds, eppelsheim, has, also, produced, subcontrabass, tubaxes, in, c, and, b, the, latter, being, the, lowest, saxophone, ever, made, among, the, 2000s, developments, is, the, aulochrome, a, double, soprano, saxophone, invented, by, belgian, instrument, maker, fran, ois, louis, in, 2001, since, the, 1950s, saxophones, with, non, metallic, bodies, have, occasionally, been, in, production, such, instruments, have, failed, to, gain, acceptance, over, a, number, of, issues, including, durability, repairability, and, deficiencies, in, key, action, and, tone, the, best, known, of, these, efforts, is, the, 1950s, grafton, acrylic, alto, saxophone, used, briefly, by, charlie, parker, and, ornette, coleman, it, had, a, production, run, of, over, 10, years, as, a, budget, model, saxophone, the, polycarbonate, vibratosax, is, in, production, as, a, low, cost, alternative, to, metal, saxophones, wooden, sawat, saxophones, are, made, in, thailand, on, a, small, scale, opinions, vary, on, the, significance, of, body, materials, to, sound, the, fingering, scheme, of, the, saxophone, which, has, had, only, minor, changes, since, the, instrument, s, original, invention, has, presented, inherent, acoustic, problems, related, to, closed, keys, below, the, first, open, tonehole, that, affect, response, of, and, slightly, muffle, some, notes, there, is, also, a, lack, of, tactile, consistency, between, key, centers, requiring, extra, effort, from, the, player, to, adjust, modes, of, muscle, memory, when, moving, between, key, centers, there, have, been, two, noteworthy, efforts, to, remedy, the, acoustic, problems, and, awkward, aspects, of, the, original, fingering, system, the, leblanc, rationale, and, system, saxophones, have, key, mechanics, designed, to, remedy, the, acoustic, problems, associated, with, closed, keys, below, the, first, open, tonehole, they, also, enable, players, to, make, half, step, shifts, of, scales, by, depressing, one, key, while, keeping, the, rest, of, the, fingering, consistent, with, that, of, the, fingering, a, half, step, away, some, leblanc, system, features, were, built, into, the, vito, model, 35, saxophones, of, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, despite, the, advantages, of, that, system, acceptance, was, impaired, by, the, expense, and, mechanical, reliability, issues, related, to, the, complexity, of, certain, key, mechanisms, the, chromatic, or, linear, fingering, saxophone, is, a, project, of, instrument, designer, and, builder, jim, schmidt, developing, a, horn, maximizing, tactile, and, logical, consistency, between, every, interval, regardless, of, the, key, and, avoiding, the, acoustic, problems, associated, with, closed, keys, below, the, first, open, tone, hole, several, working, prototypes, have, been, built, and, presented, at, trade, shows, production, of, this, original, and, expensive, saxophone, is, on, an, individual, order, basis, inexpensive, keyless, folk, versions, of, the, saxophone, made, of, bamboo, recalling, a, chalumeau, were, developed, in, the, 20th, century, by, instrument, makers, in, hawaii, jamaica, thailand, indonesia, ethiopia, and, argentina, the, hawaiian, instrument, called, a, xaphoon, was, invented, during, the, 1970s, and, is, also, marketed, as, a, bamboo, sax, although, its, cylindrical, bore, more, closely, resembles, that, of, a, clarinet, and, its, lack, of, any, keywork, makes, it, more, akin, to, a, recorder, jamaica, s, best, known, exponent, of, a, similar, type, of, homemade, bamboo, saxophone, was, the, mento, musician, and, instrument, maker, sugar, belly, william, walker, in, the, minahasa, region, of, the, indonesian, island, of, sulawesi, there, exist, entire, bands, made, up, of, bamboo, saxophones, and, brass, instruments, of, various, sizes, these, instruments, are, imitations, of, european, instruments, made, using, local, materials, similar, instruments, are, produced, in, thailand, in, argentina, ngel, sampedro, del, r, o, and, mariana, garc, a, have, produced, bamboo, saxophones, of, various, sizes, since, 1985, many, synthesizer, wind, controllers, are, played, and, fingered, like, a, saxophone, such, as, the, electronic, wind, instrument, ewi, a, double, reed, instrument, known, as, the, rothphone, and, a, brass, instrument, known, as, the, jazzophone, are, both, shaped, similarly, to, an, alto, or, tenor, saxophone
