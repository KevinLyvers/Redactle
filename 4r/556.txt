effects, and, perception, inherent, in, the, color, theories, of, michel, eug, ne, chevreul, ogden, rood, and, others, seurat, adapted, this, scientific, research, to, his, painting, seurat, contrasted, miniature, dots, or, small, brushstrokes, of, colors, that, when, unified, optically, in, the, human, eye, were, perceived, as, a, single, shade, or, hue, he, believed, that, this, form, of, painting, called, divisionism, at, the, time, a, term, he, preferred, but, now, known, as, pointillism, would, make, the, colors, more, brilliant, and, powerful, than, standard, brushstrokes, the, use, of, dots, of, almost, uniform, size, came, in, the, second, year, of, his, work, on, the, painting, 1885, 86, to, make, the, experience, of, the, painting, even, more, vivid, at, the, paintings, edge, he, surrounded, it, with, a, frame, of, painted, dots, which, in, turn, he, enclosed, with, a, pure, white, wooden, frame, which, is, how, the, painting, is, exhibited, at, the, art, institute, of, chicago, the, island, of, la, grande, jatte, is, located, at, the, very, gates, of, paris, lying, in, the, seine, between, neuilly, and, levallois, perret, a, short, distance, from, where, la, d, fense, business, district, currently, stands, although, for, many, years, it, was, an, industrial, site, it, has, become, the, site, of, a, public, garden, and, a, housing, development, when, seurat, began, the, painting, in, 1884, the, island, was, a, bucolic, retreat, far, from, the, urban, center, the, painting, was, first, exhibited, at, the, eighth, and, last, impressionist, exhibition, in, may, 1886, then, in, august, 1886, dominating, the, second, salon, of, the, soci, t, des, artistes, ind, pendants, of, which, seurat, had, been, a, founder, in, 1884, seurat, was, extremely, disciplined, always, serious, and, private, to, the, point, of, secretiveness, for, the, most, part, steering, his, own, steady, course, as, a, painter, he, wanted, to, make, a, difference, in, the, history, of, art, and, with, la, grande, jatte, seurat, was, immediately, acknowledged, as, the, leader, of, a, new, and, rebellious, form, of, impressionism, called, neo, impressionism, seurat, s, painting, was, a, mirror, impression, of, his, own, painting, bathers, at, asni, res, completed, shortly, before, in, 1884, whereas, the, bathers, in, that, earlier, painting, are, doused, in, light, almost, every, figure, on, la, grande, jatte, appears, to, be, cast, in, shadow, either, under, trees, or, an, umbrella, or, from, another, person, for, parisians, sunday, was, the, day, to, escape, the, heat, of, the, city, and, head, for, the, shade, of, the, trees, and, the, cool, breezes, that, came, off, the, river, and, at, first, glance, the, viewer, sees, many, different, people, relaxing, in, a, park, by, the, river, on, the, right, a, fashionable, couple, the, woman, with, the, sunshade, and, the, man, in, his, top, hat, are, on, a, stroll, on, the, left, another, woman, who, is, also, well, dressed, extends, her, fishing, pole, over, the, water, there, is, a, small, man, with, the, black, hat, and, thin, cane, looking, at, the, river, and, a, white, dog, with, a, brown, head, a, woman, knitting, a, man, playing, a, trumpet, two, soldiers, standing, at, attention, as, the, musician, plays, and, a, woman, hunched, under, an, orange, umbrella, seurat, also, painted, a, man, with, a, pipe, a, woman, under, a, parasol, in, a, boat, filled, with, rowers, and, a, couple, admiring, their, infant, child, some, of, the, characters, are, doing, curious, things, the, lady, on, the, right, side, has, a, pet, monkey, on, a, leash, a, lady, on, the, left, near, the, river, bank, is, fishing, the, area, was, known, at, the, time, as, being, a, place, to, procure, prostitutes, among, the, bourgeoisie, a, likely, allusion, of, the, otherwise, odd, fishing, rod, in, the, painting, s, center, stands, a, little, girl, dressed, in, white, who, is, not, in, a, shadow, who, stares, directly, at, the, viewer, of, the, painting, this, may, be, interpreted, as, someone, who, is, silently, questioning, the, audience, in, the, 1950s, historian, and, marxist, philosopher, ernst, bloch, drew, social, and, political, significance, from, seurat, s, la, grande, jatte, the, historian, s, focal, point, was, what, he, saw, as, seurat, s, mechanical, use, of, the, figures, and, what, their, static, nature, said, about, french, society, at, the, time, afterward, critique, of, the, work, often, centered, on, the, artist, s, presumed, mathematical, and, robotic, interpretation, of, the, meaning, of, modernity, in, paris, according, to, historian, of, modernism, william, r, everdell, seurat, himself, told, a, sympathetic, critic, gustave, kahn, that, his, model, was, the, panathenaic, procession, in, the, parthenon, frieze, but, seurat, didn, t, want, to, paint, ancient, athenians, he, wanted, to, make, the, moderns, file, past, in, their, essential, form, by, moderns, he, meant, nothing, very, complicated, he, wanted, ordinary, people, as, his, subject, and, ordinary, life, he, was, a, bit, of, a, democrat, a, communard, as, one, of, his, friends, remarked, referring, to, the, left, wing, revolutionaries, of, 1871, and, he, was, fascinated, by, the, way, things, distinct, and, different, encountered, each, other, the, city, and, the, country, the, farm, and, the, factory, the, bourgeois, and, the, proletarian, meeting, at, their, edges, in, a, sort, of, harmony, of, opposites, the, border, of, the, painting, is, unusually, in, inverted, color, as, if, the, world, around, them, is, also, slowly, inverting, from, the, way, of, life, they, have, known, seen, in, this, context, the, boy, who, bathes, on, the, other, side, of, the, river, bank, at, asni, res, appears, to, be, calling, out, to, them, as, if, to, say, we, are, the, future, come, and, join, us, seurat, painted, the, la, grande, jatte, in, three, distinct, stages, in, the, first, stage, which, was, started, in, 1884, he, mixed, his, paints, from, several, individual, pigments, and, was, still, using, dull, earth, pigments, such, as, ochre, or, burnt, sienna, in, the, second, stage, during, 1885, and, 1886, seurat, dispensed, with, the, earth, pigments, and, also, limited, the, number, of, individual, pigments, in, his, paints, this, change, in, his, palette, was, due, to, his, application, of, the, advanced, color, theories, of, his, time, his, intention, was, to, paint, small, dots, or, strokes, of, pure, color, that, would, then, mix, on, the, retina, of, the, beholder, to, achieve, the, desired, color, impression, instead, of, the, usual, practice, of, mixing, individual, pigments, seurat, s, palette, consisted, of, the, usual, pigments, of, his, time, such, as, cobalt, blue, emerald, green, and, vermilion, additionally, he, used, the, then, new, pigment, zinc, yellow, zinc, chromate, predominantly, for, yellow, highlights, in, the, sunlit, grass, in, the, middle, of, the, painting, but, also, in, mixtures, with, orange, and, blue, pigments, in, the, century, and, more, since, the, painting, s, completion, the, zinc, yellow, has, darkened, to, brown, a, color, degeneration, that, was, already, showing, in, the, painting, in, seurat, s, lifetime, the, discoloration, of, the, originally, bright, yellow, zinc, yellow, zinc, chromate, to, a, brownish, color, is, due, to, the, chemical, reaction, of, the, chromate, ions, to, orange, colored, dichromate, ions, in, the, third, stage, during, 1888, 89, seurat, added, the, colored, borders, to, his, composition, the, results, of, investigation, into, the, discoloration, of, this, painting, have, been, combined, with, further, research, into, natural, aging, of, paints, to, digitally, rejuvenate, the, painting, in, 1923, frederic, bartlett, was, appointed, trustee, of, the, art, institute, of, chicago, he, and, his, second, wife, helen, birch, bartlett,
