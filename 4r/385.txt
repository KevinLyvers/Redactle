the, flashing, colored, lights, such, as, cocaine, nicknamed, blow, amyl, nitrite, poppers, and, the, other, quintessential, 1970s, club, drug, quaalude, which, suspended, motor, coordination, and, gave, the, sensation, that, one, s, arms, and, legs, had, turned, to, jell, o, quaaludes, were, so, popular, at, disco, clubs, that, the, drug, was, nicknamed, disco, biscuits, paul, gootenberg, states, that, he, relationship, of, cocaine, to, 1970s, disco, culture, cannot, be, stressed, enough, during, the, 1970s, the, use, of, cocaine, by, well, to, do, celebrities, led, to, its, glamorization, and, to, the, widely, held, view, that, it, was, a, soft, drug, lsd, marijuana, and, speed, amphetamines, were, also, popular, in, disco, clubs, and, the, use, of, these, drugs, contributed, to, the, hedonistic, quality, of, the, dance, floor, experience, since, disco, dances, were, typically, held, in, liquor, licensed, nightclubs, and, dance, clubs, alcoholic, drinks, were, also, consumed, by, dancers, some, users, intentionally, combined, alcohol, with, the, consumption, of, other, drugs, such, as, quaaludes, for, a, stronger, effect, according, to, peter, braunstein, the, massive, quantities, of, drugs, ingested, in, discoth, ques, produced, the, next, cultural, phenomenon, of, the, disco, era, rampant, promiscuity, and, public, sex, while, the, dance, floor, was, the, central, arena, of, seduction, actual, sex, usually, took, place, in, the, nether, regions, of, the, disco, bathroom, stalls, exit, stairwells, and, so, on, in, other, cases, the, disco, became, a, kind, of, main, course, in, a, hedonist, s, menu, for, a, night, out, at, the, saint, nightclub, a, high, percentage, of, the, gay, male, dancers, and, patrons, would, have, sex, in, the, club, they, typically, had, unprotected, sex, because, in, 1980, hiv, aids, had, not, yet, been, identified, at, the, saint, dancers, would, elope, to, an, unpoliced, upstairs, balcony, to, engage, in, sex, the, promiscuity, and, public, sex, at, discos, was, part, of, a, broader, trend, towards, exploring, a, freer, sexual, expression, in, the, 1970s, an, era, that, is, also, associated, with, swingers, clubs, hot, tubs, key, parties, in, his, paper, in, defense, of, disco, 1979, richard, dyer, claims, eroticism, as, one, of, the, three, main, characteristics, of, disco, as, opposed, to, rock, music,

against, wdai, at, the, time, wgci, fm, would, later, incorporate, r, b, and, pop, songs, into, the, format, eventually, evolving, into, an, urban, contemporary, outlet, that, it, continues, with, today, the, latter, also, helped, bring, the, chicago, house, genre, to, the, airwaves, factors, that, have, been, cited, as, leading, to, the, decline, of, disco, in, the, united, states, include, economic, and, political, changes, at, the, end, of, the, 1970s, as, well, as, burnout, from, the, hedonistic, lifestyles, led, by, participants, in, the, years, since, disco, demolition, night, some, social, critics, have, described, the, disco, sucks, movement, as, implicitly, macho, and, bigoted, and, an, attack, on, non, white, and, non, heterosexual, cultures, it, was, also, interpreted, being, part, of, a, wider, cultural, backlash, the, move, towards, conservatism, that, also, made, its, way, into, us, politics, with, the, election, of, conservative, president, ronald, reagan, in, 1980, which, also, led, to, republican, control, of, the, united, states, senate, for, the, first, time, since, 1954, plus, the, subsequent, rise, of, the, religious, right, around, the, same, time, in, january, 1979, rock, critic, robert, christgau, argued, that, homophobia, and, most, likely, racism, were, reasons, behind, the, movement, a, conclusion, seconded, by, john, rockwell, craig, werner, wrote, the, anti, disco, movement, represented, an, unholy, alliance, of, funkateers, and, feminists, progressives, and, puritans, rockers, and, reactionaries, nonetheless, the, attacks, on, disco, gave, respectable, voice, to, the, ugliest, kinds, of, unacknowledged, racism, sexism, and, homophobia, legs, mcneil, founder, of, the, fanzine, punk, was, quoted, in, an, interview, as, saying, the, hippies, always, wanted, to, be, black, we, were, going, fuck, the, blues, fuck, the, black, experience, he, also, said, that, disco, was, the, result, of, an, unholy, union, between, homosexuals, and, blacks, steve, dahl, who, had, spearheaded, disco, demolition, night, denied, any, racist, or, homophobic, undertones, to, the, promotion, saying, it, s, really, easy, to, look, at, it, historically, from, this, perspective, and, attach, all, those, things, to, it, but, we, weren, t, thinking, like, that, it, was, just, kids, pissing, on, a, musical, genre, it, has, been, noted, that, british, punk, rock, critics, of, disco, were, very, supportive, of, the, pro, black, anti, racist, reggae, genre, as, well, as, the, more, pro, gay, new, romantics, movement, christgau, and, jim, testa, have, said, that, there, were, legitimate, artistic, reasons, for, being, critical, of, disco, in, 1979, the, music, industry, in, the, united, states, underwent, its, worst, slump, in, decades, and, disco, despite, its, mass, popularity, was, blamed, the, producer, oriented, sound, was, having, difficulty, mixing, well, with, the, industry, s, artist, oriented, marketing, system, harold, childs, senior, vice, president, at, a, m, records, reportedly, told, the, los, angeles, times, that, radio, is, really, desperate, for, rock, product, and, they, re, all, looking, for, some, white, rock, n, roll, gloria, gaynor, argued, that, the, music, industry, supported, the, destruction, of, disco, because, rock, music, producers, were, losing, money, and, rock, musicians, were, losing, the, spotlight, disco, was, instrumental, in, the, development, of, electronic, dance, music, genres, like, house, techno, and, eurodance, the, eurodisco, song, i, feel, love, produced, by, giorgio, moroder, for, donna, summer, in, 1976, has, been, described, as, a, milestone, and, blueprint, for, electronic, dance, music, because, it, was, the, first, to, combine, repetitive, synthesizer, loops, with, a, continuous, four, on, the, floor, bass, drum, and, an, off, beat, hi, hat, which, would, become, a, main, feature, of, techno, and, house, ten, years, later, during, the, first, years, of, the, 1980s, the, traditional, disco, sound, characterized, by, complex, arrangements, performed, by, large, ensembles, of, studio, session, musicians, including, a, horn, section, and, an, orchestral, string, section, began, to, be, phased, out, and, faster, tempos, and, synthesized, effects, accompanied, by, guitar, and, simplified, backgrounds, moved, dance, music, toward, electronic, and, pop, genres, starting, with, hi, nrg, despite, its, decline, in, popularity, so, called, club, music, and, european, style, disco, remained, relatively, successful, in, the, early, to, mid, 1980s, with, songs, like, aneka, s, japanese, boy, the, weather, girls, s, it, s, raining, men, stacey, q, s, two, of, hearts, dead, or, alive, s, you, spin, me, round, like, a, record, laura, branigan, s, self, control, and, baltimora, s, tarzan, boy, however, a, revival, of, the, traditional, style, disco, called, nu, disco, has, been, popular, since, the, 1990s, house, music, displayed, a, strong, disco, influence, which, is, why, house, music, regarding, its, enormous, success, in, shaping, electronic, dance, music, and, contemporary, club, culture, is, often, described, being, disco, s, revenge, early, house, music, was, generally, dance, based, music, characterized, by, repetitive, four, on, the, floor, beats, rhythms, mainly, provided, by, drum, machines, off, beat, hi, hat, cymbals, and, synthesized, basslines, while, house, displayed, several, characteristics, similar, to, disco, music, it, was, more, electronic, and, minimalist, and, the, repetitive, rhythm, of, house, was, more, important, than, the, song, itself, as, well, house, did, not, use, the, lush, string, sections, that, were, a, key, part, of, the, disco, sound, the, rising, popularity, of, disco, came, in, tandem, with, developments, in, the, role, of, the, dj, djing, developed, from, the, use, of, multiple, record, turntables, and, dj, mixers, to, create, a, continuous, seamless, mix, of, songs, with, one, song, transitioning, to, another, with, no, break, in, the, music, to, interrupt, the, dancing, the, resulting, dj, mix, differed, from, previous, forms, of, dance, music, in, the, 1960s, which, were, oriented, towards, live, performances, by, musicians, it, in, turn, affected, the, arrangement, of, dance, music, since, songs, in, the, disco, era, typically, contained, beginnings, and, endings, marked, by, a, simple, beat, or, riff, that, could, be, easily, used, to, transition, to, a, new, song, the, development, of, djing, was, also, influenced, by, new, turntablism, techniques, such, as, beatmatching, and, scratching, a, process, facilitated, by, the, introduction, of, new, turntable, technologies, such, as, the, technics, sl, 1200, mk, 2, first, sold, in, 1978, which, had, a, precise, variable, pitch, control, and, a, direct, drive, motor, djs, were, often, avid, record, collectors, who, would, hunt, through, used, record, stores, for, obscure, soul, records, and, vintage, funk, recordings, djs, helped, to, introduce, rare, records, and, new, artists, to, club, audiences, in, the, 1970s, individual, djs, became, more, prominent, and, some, djs, such, as, larry, levan, the, resident, at, paradise, garage, jim, burgess, tee, scott, and, francis, grasso, became, famous, in, the, disco, scene, levan, for, example, developed, a, cult, following, among, clubgoers, who, referred, to, his, dj, sets, as, saturday, mass, some, djs, would, use, reel, to, reel, tape, recorders, to, make, remixes, and, tape, edits, of, songs, some, djs, who, were, making, remixes, made, the, transition, from, the, dj, booth, to, becoming, a, record, producer, notably, burgess, scott, developed, several, innovations, he, was, the, first, disco, dj, to, use, three, turntables, as, sound, sources, the, first, to, simultaneously, play, two, beat, matched, records, the, first, to, use, electronic, effects, units, in, his, mixes, and, he, was, an, innovator, in, mixing, dialogue, in, from, well, known, movies, typically, over, a, percussion, break, these, mixing, techniques, were, also, applied, to, radio, djs, such, as, ted, currier, of, wktu, and, wbls, grasso, is, particularly, notable, for, taking, the, dj, profession, out, of, servitude, and, the, dj, the, musical, head, chef, once, he, entered, the, scene, the, dj, was, no, longer, responsible, for, waiting, on, the, crowd, hand, and, foot, meeting, their, every, song, request, instead, with, increased, agency, and, visibility, the, dj, was, now, able, to, use, their, own, technical, and, creative, skills, to, whip, up, a, nightly, special, of, innovative, mixes, refining, their, personal, sound, and, aesthetic, and, building, their, own, reputation, the, post, disco, sound, and, genres, associated, with, it, originated, in, the, 1970s, and, early, 1980s, with, r, b, and, post, punk, musicians, focusing, on, a, more, electronic, and, experimental, side, of, disco, spawning, boogie, italo, disco, and, alternative, dance, drawing, from, a, diverse, range, of, non, disco, influences, and, techniques, such, as, the, one, man, band, style, of, kashif, and,

had, a, strong, influence, on, early, hip, hop, most, of, the, early, hip, hop, songs, were, created, by, isolating, existing, disco, bass, guitar, lines, and, dubbing, over, them, with, mc, rhymes, the, sugarhill, gang, used, chic, s, good, times, as, the, foundation, for, their, 1979, song, rapper, s, delight, generally, considered, to, be, the, song, that, first, popularized, rap, music, in,
