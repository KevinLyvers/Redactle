the, lyre, l, a, r, is, a, stringed, musical, instrument, that, is, classified, by, hornbostel, sachs, as, a, member, of, the, lute, family, of, instruments, in, organology, a, lyre, is, considered, a, yoke, lute, since, it, is, a, lute, in, which, the, strings, are, attached, to, a, yoke, that, lies, in, the, same, plane, as, the, sound, table, and, consists, of, two, arms, and, a, crossbar, the, lyre, has, its, origins, in, ancient, history, lyres, were, used, in, several, ancient, cultures, surrounding, the, mediterranean, sea, the, earliest, known, examples, of, the, lyre, have, been, recovered, at, archeological, sites, that, date, to, c, 2700, bce, in, mesopotamia, the, oldest, lyres, from, the, fertile, crescent, are, known, as, the, eastern, lyres, and, are, distinguished, from, other, ancient, lyres, by, their, flat, base, they, have, been, found, at, archaeological, sites, in, egypt, syria, anatolia, and, the, levant, the, round, lyre, or, the, western, lyre, also, originated, in, syria, and, anatolia, but, was, not, as, widely, used, and, eventually, died, out, in, the, east, c, 1750, bce, the, round, lyre, so, called, for, its, rounded, base, reappeared, in, ancient, greece, c, 1700, 1400, bce, and, then, later, spread, throughout, the, roman, empire, this, lyre, served, as, the, origin, of, the, european, lyre, known, as, the, germanic, lyre, or, rotte, that, was, widely, used, in, north, western, europe, from, pre, christian, to, medieval, times, the, earliest, reference, to, the, word, lyre, is, the, mycenaean, greek, ru, ra, ta, e, meaning, lyrists, and, written, in, the, linear, b, script, in, classical, greek, the, word, lyre, could, either, refer, specifically, to, an, amateur, instrument, which, is, a, smaller, version, of, the, professional, cithara, and, eastern, aegean, barbiton, or, lyre, can, refer, generally, to, all, three, instruments, as, a, family, the, english, word, comes, via, latin, from, the, greek, hornbostel, sachs, classifies, the, lyre, as, a, member, of, the, lute, family, of, instruments, which, is, one, of, the, families, under, the, chordophone, classification, of, instruments, hornbostel, sachs, divide, lyres, into, two, groups, bowl, lyres, 321, 21, box, lyres, 321, 22, in, organology, a, lyre, is, considered, a, yoke, lute, since, it, is, a, lute, in, which, the, strings, are, attached, to, a, yoke, that, lies, in, the, same, plane, as, the, sound, table, and, consists, of, two, arms, and, a, crossbar, there, is, evidence, of, the, development, of, many, forms, of, lyres, from, the, period, 2700, bce, through, 700, bce, lyres, from, the, ancient, world, are, divided, by, scholars, into, two, separate, groups, the, eastern, lyres, and, the, western, lyres, which, are, defined, by, patterns, of, geography, and, chronology, eastern, lyres, also, known, as, flat, based, lyres, are, lyres, which, originated, in, the, fertile, crescent, mesoptamia, in, what, is, present, day, syria, anatolia, the, levant, and, egypt, the, eastern, lyres, all, contain, sound, boxes, with, flat, bases, they, are, the, oldest, lyres, with, iconographical, evidence, of, their, existence, such, as, depictions, of, the, eastern, lyre, on, pottery, dating, back, to, 2700, bce, while, flat, based, lyres, originated, in, the, east, they, were, also, later, found, in, the, west, after, 700, bce, by, the, hellenistic, period, c, 330, bce, what, was, once, a, clearly, divided, use, of, flat, based, lyres, in, the, east, and, round, based, lyres, in, the, west, had, disappeared, as, trade, routes, between, the, east, and, the, west, dispersed, both, kinds, of, instruments, across, more, geographic, regions, eastern, lyres, are, divided, into, four, main, types, bull, lyres, thick, lyres, thin, lyres, and, giant, lyres, bull, lyres, are, a, type, of, eastern, lyre, that, have, a, flat, base, and, bull, s, head, on, one, side, the, lyres, of, ur, are, bull, lyres, excavated, in, ancient, mesopotamia, modern, iraq, which, date, to, 2500, bc, and, are, considered, to, be, the, world, s, oldest, surviving, stringed, instruments, however, older, pictorial, evidence, of, bull, lyres, exist, in, other, parts, of, mesopotamia, and, elam, including, susa, thick, lyres, are, a, type, of, flat, based, eastern, lyre, that, comes, from, egypt, 2000, 100, bce, and, anatolia, c, 1600, bce, the, thick, lyre, is, distinguished, by, a, thicker, sound, box, which, allowed, for, the, inclusion, of, more, strings, these, strings, were, held, on, a, larger, box, bridge, than, the, other, type, of, eastern, lyres, and, the, sound, hole, of, the, instrument, was, cut, in, the, body, of, the, lyre, behind, the, box, bridge, while, similar, to, the, bull, lyre, in, size, the, thick, lyre, did, not, contain, the, head, of, an, animal, but, did, depict, images, of, animals, on, the, arms, or, yoke, of, the, instrument, like, the, bull, lyre, the, thick, lyre, did, not, use, use, a, plectrum, but, was, plucked, by, hand, while, the, clearest, examples, of, the, thick, lyre, are, extant, to, archaeological, sites, in, egypt, and, anatolia, similar, large, lyres, with, thicker, soundboxes, have, been, found, in, mesopotamia, 1900, 1500, bce, however, these, mesopotamia, lyres, lack, the, box, bridge, found, in, the, instruments, from, egypt, and, anatolia, thin, lyres, are, a, type, of, flat, based, eastern, lyre, with, a, thinner, soundbox, where, the, sound, hole, is, created, by, leaving, the, base, of, the, resonator, open, the, earliest, known, example, of, the, thin, lyre, dates, to, c, 2500, bce, in, syria, after, this, examples, of, the, thin, lyre, can, be, found, throughout, the, fertile, crescent, the, thin, lyre, is, the, only, one, of, the, ancient, eastern, lyres, that, is, still, used, in, instrument, design, today, among, current, practitioners, of, the, instrument, as, a, means, of, support, players, of, the, thin, lyre, wear, a, sling, around, the, left, wrist, which, is, also, attached, to, the, base, of, the, lyre, s, right, arm, it, is, played, using, a, plectrum, or, pic, to, strike, the, strings, a, technique, later, used, by, the, greeks, on, the, western, lyres, there, are, several, regional, variations, in, the, design, of, thin, lyres, the, egyptian, thin, lyre, was, characterized, by, arms, that, bulged, outwards, asymmetrically, a, feature, also, found, later, in, samaria, c, 375, 323, bce, in, contrast, thin, lyres, in, syria, and, phoenicia, c, 700, bce, were, symmetrical, in, shape, and, had, straight, arms, with, a, perpendicular, yoke, which, formed, the, outline, of, a, rectangle, the, kinnor, is, an, ancient, israelite, musical, instrument, that, is, thought, to, be, a, type, of, thin, lyre, based, on, iconographic, archaeological, evidence, it, is, the, first, instrument, from, the, lyre, family, mentioned, in, the, old, testament, its, exact, identification, is, unclear, but, in, the, modern, day, it, is, generally, translated, as, harp, or, lyre, 440, and, associated, with, a, type, of, lyre, depicted, in, israelite, imagery, particularly, the, bar, kochba, coins, 440, it, has, been, referred, to, as, the, national, instrument, of, the, jewish, people, and, modern, luthiers, have, created, reproduction, lyres, of, the, kinnor, based, on, this, imagery, giant, lyres, are, a, type, of, flat, based, eastern, lyre, of, immense, size, that, typically, required, two, players, played, from, a, standing, position, the, instrument, stood, taller, than, the, instrumentalists, the, oldest, extent, example, of, the, instrument, was, found, in, the, ancient, city, of, uruk, in, what, is, present, day, iraq, and, dates, to, c, 2500, bce, well, preserved, giant, lyres, dating, to, c, 1600, bce, have, been, found, in, anatolia, the, instrument, reached, the, height, of, its, popularity, in, ancient, egypt, during, the, reign, of, pharaoh, akhenaten, c, 1353, 1336, bce, a, giant, lyre, found, in, the, ancient, city, of, susa, c, 2500, bce, is, suspected, to, have, been, played, by, only, a, single, instrumentalist, and, giant, lyres, in, egypt, dating, from, the, hellenistic, period, most, likely, also, required, only, a, single, player, western, lyres, sometimes, referred, to, as, round, based, lyres, are, lyres, from, the, ancient, history, that, were, extant, in, the, aegean, greece, and, italy, they, initially, contained, only, round, rather, than, flat, bases, but, by, the, hellenistic, period, both, constructs, of, lyre, could, be, found, in, these, regions, like, the, flat, based, eastern, lyres, the, round, based, lyre, also, originated, in, northern, syria, and, southern, anatolia, in, the, 3rd, millennium, bce, however, this, round, based, construction, of, the, lyre, was, less, common, than, its, flat, based, counterparts, in, the, east, and, by, c, 1750, bce, the, instrument, had, died, out, completely, in, this, region, the, round, based, lyre, re, appeared, in, the, west, in, ancient, greece, where, it, was, sole, form, of, lyre, used, between, 1400, bce, and, 700, bce, like, the, eastern, flat, based, lyre, the, western, round, based, lyre, also, had, several, sub, types, homer, described, two, different, western, lyres, in, his, writings, the, phorminx, and, kitharis, however, both, of, these, terms, have, not, had, uniform, meaning, across, time, and, their, use, during, homer, s, time, was, later, altered, today, scholars, divide, instruments, referred, to, as, kitharis, into, two, subgroups, the, round, based, cylinder, kithara, and, the, flat, based, concert, kithara, in, ancient, greece, recitations, of, lyric, poetry, were, accompanied, by, lyre, playing, the, earliest, picture, of, a, greek, lyre, appears, in, the, famous, sarcophagus, of, hagia, triada, a, minoan, settlement, in, crete, the, sarcophagus, was, used, during, the, mycenaean, occupation, of, crete, c, 1400, bc, the, lyre, of, classical, antiquity, was, ordinarily, played, by, being, strummed, like, a, guitar, or, a, zither, rather, than, being, plucked, with, the, fingers, as, with, a, harp, a, pick, called, a, plectrum, was, held, in, one, hand, while, the, fingers, of, the, free, hand, silenced, the, unwanted, strings, a, classical, lyre, has, a, hollow, body, or, sound, chest, also, known, as, soundbox, or, resonator, which, in, ancient, greek, tradition, was, made, out, of, turtle, shell, extending, from, this, sound, chest, are, two, raised, arms, which, are, sometimes, hollow, and, are, curved, both, outward, and, forward, they, are, connected, near, the, top, by, a, crossbar, or, yoke, an, additional, crossbar, fixed, to, the, sound, chest, makes, the, bridge, which, transmits, the, vibrations, of, the, strings, the, deepest, note, was, that, closest, to, the, player, s, body, since, the, strings, did, not, differ, much, in, length, more, weight, may, have, been, gained, for, the, deeper, notes, by, thicker, strings, as, in, the, violin, and, similar, modern, instruments, or, they, were, tuned, by, having, a, slacker, tension, the, strings, were, of, gut, animal, intestines, they, were, stretched, between, the, yoke, and, bridge, or, to, a, tailpiece, below, the, bridge, there, were, two, ways, of, tuning, one, was, to, fasten, the, strings, to, pegs, that, might, be, turned, while, the, other, was, to, change, the, placement, of, the, string, on, the, crossbar, it, is, likely, that, both, expedients, were, used, simultaneously, lyres, were, used, without, a, fingerboard, no, greek, description, or, representation, having, ever, been, met, with, that, can, be, construed, as, referring, to, one, nor, was, a, bow, possible, the, flat, sound, board, being, an, insuperable, impediment, the, pick, or, plectrum, however, was, in, constant, use, it, was, held, in, the, right, hand, to, set, the, upper, strings, in, vibration, when, not, in, use, it, hung, from, the, instrument, by, a, ribbon, the, fingers, of, the, left, hand, touched, the, lower, strings, presumably, to, silence, those, whose, notes, were, not, wanted, before, greek, civilization, had, assumed, its, historic, form, c, 1200, bc, there, was, likely, to, have, been, great, freedom, and, independence, of, different, localities, in, the, matter, of, lyre, stringing, which, is, corroborated, by, the, antique, use, of, the, chromatic, half, tone, and, enharmonic, quarter, tone, tunings, pointing, to, an, early, exuberance, and, perhaps, also, to, a, bias, towards, refinements, of, intonation, the, number, of, strings, on, the, classical, lyre, therefore, varied, with, three, four, six, seven, eight, and, ten, having, been, popular, at, various, times, the, priest, and, biographer, plutarch, c, 100, ad, wrote, of, the, musicians, of, the, archaic, period, olympus, and, terpander, that, they, used, only, three, strings, to, accompany, their, recitation, but, there, is, no, evidence, for, or, against, this, dating, from, that, period, the, earliest, known, lyre, had, four, strings, tuned, to, create, a, tetrachord, or, series, of, four, tones, filling, in, the, interval, of, a, perfect, fourth, by, doubling, the, tetrachord, a, lyre, with, seven, or, eight, strings, was, obtained, likewise, the, three, stringed, lyre, may, have, given, rise, to, the, six, stringed, lyre, depicted, on, many, archaic, greek, vases, the, accuracy, of, this, representation, cannot, be, insisted, upon, the, vase, painters, being, little, mindful, of, the, complete, expression, of, details, yet, one, may, suppose, their, tendency, would, be, rather, to, imitate, than, to, invent, a, number, it, was, their, constant, practice, to, represent, the, strings, as, being, damped, by, the, fingers, of, the, left, hand, of, the, player, after, having, been, struck, by, the, plectrum, held, in, the, right, hand, according, to, ancient, greek, mythology, the, young, god, hermes, stole, a, herd, of, sacred, cows, from, apollo, in, order, not, to, be, followed, he, made, shoes, for, the, cows, which, were, facing, backwards, making, it, appear, that, the, animals, had, walked, in, the, opposite, direction, apollo, following, the, trails, could, not, follow, where, the, cows, were, going, along, the, way, hermes, slaughtered, one, of, the, cows, and, offered, all, but, the, entrails, to, the, gods, from, the, entrails, and, a, tortoise, turtle, shell, he, created, the, lyre, apollo, figuring, out, it, was, hermes, who, had, his, cows, confronted, the, young, god, apollo, was, furious, but, after, hearing, the, sound, of, the, lyre, his, anger, faded, apollo, offered, to, trade, the, herd, of, cattle, for, the, lyre, hence, the, creation, of, the, lyre, is, attributed, to, hermes, other, sources, credit, it, to, apollo, himself, some, of, the, cultures, using, and, developing, the, lyre, were, the, aeolian, and, ionian, greek, colonies, on, the, coasts, of, asia, ancient, asia, minor, modern, day, turkey, bordering, the, lydian, empire, some, mythic, masters, like, musaeus, and, thamyris, were, believed, to, have, been, born, in, thrace, another, place, of, extensive, greek, colonization, the, name, kissar, cithara, given, by, the, ancient, greeks, to, egyptian, box, instruments, reveals, the, apparent, similarities, recognized, by, greeks, themselves, the, cultural, peak, of, ancient, egypt, and, thus, the, possible, age, of, the, earliest, instruments, of, this, type, predates, the, 5th, century, classic, greece, this, indicates, the, possibility, that, the, lyre, might, have, existed, in, one, of, greece, s, neighboring, countries, either, thrace, lydia, or, egypt, and, was, introduced, into, greece, at, pre, classic, times, other, instruments, known, as, lyres, have, been, fashioned, and, used, in, europe, outside, the, greco, roman, world, since, at, least, the, iron, age, lyres, are, depicted, on, ceramic, and, bronze, vessels, of, the, proto, celtic, hallstatt, culture, across, central, europe, among, them, there, are, lyres, with, rounded, bottoms, stringed, instruments, whose, resonators, seem, to, be, missing, and, lyres, with, strongly, curved, yokes, and, single, or, double, bulging, resonators, the, number, of, strings, depicted, varies, from, two, to, ten, fragmented, tuning, pegs, and, bridges, made, of, wood, have, been, discovered, from, the, iron, age, industrial, settlement, in, the, ramsau, valley, at, d, rrnberg, austria, possible, further, wooden, tuning, pegs, have, been, found, in, glastonbury, in, somerset, in, england, and, biskupin, in, poland, the, remains, of, what, is, thought, to, be, the, bridge, of, a, 2300, year, old, lyre, were, discovered, on, the, isle, of, skye, scotland, in, 2010, in, 1988, a, stone, bust, from, the, 2nd, or, 1st, century, bc, was, discovered, in, brittany, france, which, depicts, a, figure, wearing, a, torc, playing, a, seven, string, lyre, the, germanic, lyre, is, representative, of, a, separate, strand, of, lyre, development, appearing, in, warrior, graves, of, the, first, millennium, ad, these, lyres, differ, from, the, lyres, of, the, mediterranean, antiquity, by, a, long, shallow, and, broadly, rectangular, shape, with, a, hollow, soundbox, curving, at, the, base, and, two, hollow, arms, connected, across, the, top, by, an, integrated, crossbar, or, yoke, famous, examples, include, the, lyre, from, the, ship, burial, at, sutton, hoo, and, the, decayed, lyre, discovered, in, silhouette, at, the, prittlewell, royal, anglo, saxon, burial, in, essex, the, waterlogged, lyre, recovered, from, a, grave, at, trossingen, germany, in, 2001, is, the, best, preserved, example, found, so, far, some, instruments, called, lyres, were, played, with, a, bow, in, europe, and, parts, of, the, middle, east, namely, the, arabic, rebab, and, its, descendants, including, the, byzantine, lyra, after, the, bow, made, its, way, into, europe, from, the, middle, east, it, was, applied, to, several, species, of, those, lyres, that, were, small, enough, to, make, bowing, practical, the, dates, of, origin, and, other, evolutionary, details, of, the, european, bowed, lyres, continue, to, be, disputed, among, organologists, but, there, is, general, agreement, that, none, of, them, were, the, ancestors, of, modern, orchestral, bowed, stringed, instruments, as, once, was, thought, there, came, to, be, two, different, kinds, of, bowed, european, lyres, those, with, fingerboards, and, those, without, the, last, surviving, examples, of, instruments, within, the, latter, class, were, the, scandinavian, talharpa, and, the, finnish, jouhikko, different, tones, could, be, obtained, from, a, single, bowed, string, by, pressing, the, fingernails, of, the, player, s, left, hand, against, various, points, along, the, string, to, fret, the, string, the, last, of, the, bowed, lyres, with, a, fingerboard, was, the, modern, c, 1485, 1800, welsh, crwth, it, had, several, predecessors, both, in, the, british, isles, and, in, continental, europe, pitch, was, changed, on, individual, strings, by, pressing, the, string, firmly, against, the, fingerboard, with, the, fingertips, like, a, violin, this, method, shortened, the, vibrating, length, of, the, string, to, produce, higher, tones, while, releasing, the, finger, gave, the, string, a, greater, vibrating, length, thereby, producing, a, tone, lower, in, pitch, this, is, the, principle, on, which, the, modern, violin, and, guitar, work, the, term, is, also, used, metaphorically, to, refer, to, the, work, or, skill, of, a, poet, as, in, shelley, s, make, me, thy, lyre, even, as, the, forest, is, or, byron, s, i, wish, to, tune, my, quivering, lyre, to, deeds, of, fame, and, notes, of, fire, over, time, the, name, in, the, wider, hellenic, space, came, to, be, used, to, label, mostly, bowed, lutes, such, as, the, byzantine, lyra, the, pontic, lyra, the, constantinopolitan, lyra, the, cretan, lyra, the, lira, da, braccio, the, calabrian, lira, the, lijerica, the, lyra, viol, the, lirone
