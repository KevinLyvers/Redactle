which, the, despairing, apu, abandons, his, child, but, eventually, returns, to, accept, his, responsibilities, in, 1950, ray, had, decided, that, pather, panchali, the, classic, coming, of, age, story, bildungsroman, of, bengali, literature, published, in, 1928, by, bibhutibhusan, bandopadhyay, would, be, the, subject, matter, for, his, first, film, this, semi, autobiographical, novel,

watching, the, italian, neorealist, film, bicycle, thieves, 1948, while, he, was, in, london, besides, the, influence, of, european, cinema, and, bengali, literature, ray, is, also, indebted, to, the, indian, theatrical, tradition, particularly, the, rasa, theory, of, classical, sanskrit, drama, the, complicated, doctrine, of, rasa, centers, predominantly, on, feelings, experienced, not, only, by, the, characters, but, also, conveyed, in, a, certain, artistic, way, to, the, spectator, the, duality, of, rasa, representation, shows, in, the, apu, trilogy, ray, gathered, an, inexperienced, crew,

in, late, 1952, using, ray, s, personal, savings, he, had, hoped, that, once, the, initial, shots, had, been, completed, he, would, be, able, to, obtain, funds, to, support, the, project, but, such, funding, was, not, forthcoming, pather, panchali, was, shot, over, the, unusually, long, period, of, three, years, because, shooting, was, possible, only, from, time, to, time, when, ray, or, production, manager, anil, chowdhury, could, arrange, further, money, with, a, loan, from, the, west, bengal, government, the, film, was, finally, completed, and, released, in, 1955, to, great, critical, and, popular, success, sweeping, up, numerous, prizes, and, having, long, runs, in, both, india, and, abroad, during, the, making, of, the, film, ray, refused, funding, from, sources, who, demanded, a, change, in, script, or, the, supervision, of, the, producer, and, he, ignored, advice, from, the, government, which, finally, funded, the, film, anyway, to, incorporate, a, happy, ending, in, having, apu, s, family, join, a, development, project, even, greater, help, than, renoir, s, encouragement, occurred, when, ray, showed, a, sequence, to, john, huston, who, was, in, india, scouting, locations, for, the, man, who, would, be, king, the, sequence, is, the, remarkable, vision, apu, and, his, sister, have, of, the, train, running, through, the, countryside, it, was, the, only, sequence, ray, had, filmed, due, to, his, small, budget, huston, praised, ray, to, monroe, wheeler, at, the, new, york, museum, of, modern, art, saying, that, a, major, talent, was, on, the, horizon, in, india, the, reaction, to, the, film, was, enthusiastic, the, times, of, india, wrote, that, it, is, absurd, to, compare, it, with, any, other, indian, cinema, pather, panchali, is, pure, cinema, in, the, united, kingdom, lindsay, anderson, wrote, a, glowing, review, of, the, film, however, the, reaction, was, not, uniformly, positive, after, watching, the, film, fran, ois, truffaut, is, reported, to, have, said, i, don, t, want, to, see, a, movie, of, peasants, eating, with, their, hands, bosley, crowther, then, the, most, influential, critic, of, the, new, york, times, wrote, a, mixed, review, of, the, film, that, its, distributor, ed, harrison, thought, would, kill, off, the, film, when, it, got, released, in, the, united, states, but, it, enjoyed, an, exceptionally, long, run, ray, s, international, career, started, in, earnest, after, the, success, of, his, next, film, aparajito, the, unvanquished, this, film, shows, the, eternal, struggle, between, the, ambitions,
