walkers, jugglers, magicians, ventriloquists, and, unicyclists, as, well, as, other, object, manipulation, and, stunt, oriented, artists, the, term, circus, also, describes, the, field, of, performance, training, and, community, which, has, followed, various, formats, through, its, 250, year, modern, history, although, not, the, inventor, of, the, medium, newcastle, under, lyme, born, philip, astley, is, credited, as, the, father, of, the, modern, circus, in, 1768, astley, a, skilled, equestrian, began, performing, exhibitions, of, trick, horse, riding, in, an, open, field, called, ha, penny, hatch, on, the, south, side, of, the, thames, river, england, in, 1770, he, hired, acrobats, tightrope, walkers, jugglers, and, a, clown, to, fill, in, the, pauses, between, the, equestrian, demonstrations, and, thus, chanced, on, the, format, which, was, later, named, a, circus, performances, developed, significantly, over, the, next, fifty, years, with, large, scale, theatrical, battle, reenactments, becoming, a, significant, feature, the, format, in, which, a, ringmaster, introduces, a, variety, of, choreographed, acts, set, to, music, often, termed, traditional, or, classical, circus, developed, in, the, latter, part, of, the, 19th, century, and, remained, the, dominant, format, until, the, 1970s, as, styles, of, performance, have, developed, since, the, time, of, astley, so, too, have, the, types, of, venue, where, these, circuses, have, performed, the, earliest, modern, circuses, were, performed, in, open, air, structures, with, limited, covered, seating, from, the, late, 18th, to, late, 19th, century, custom, made, circus, buildings, often, wooden, were, built, with, various, types, of, seating, a, centre, ring, and, sometimes, a, stage, the, traditional, large, tents, commonly, known, as, big, tops, were, introduced, in, the, mid, 19th, century, as, touring, circuses, superseded, static, venues, these, tents, eventually, became, the, most, common, venue, contemporary, circus, is, performed, in, a, variety, of, venues, including, tents, theatres, casinos, cruise, ships, and, open, air, spaces, many, circus, performances, are, still, held, in, a, ring, usually, 13, m, 43, ft, in, diameter, this, dimension, was, adopted, by, astley, in, the, late, 18th, century, as, the, minimum, diameter, that, enabled, an, acrobatic, horse, rider, to, stand, upright, on, a, cantering, horse, to, perform, their, tricks, a, shift, in, form, has, been, credited, with, a, revival, of, the, circus, tradition, since, the, late, 1970s, when, a, number, of, groups, began, to, experiment, with, new, circus, formats, and, aesthetics, typically, avoiding, the, use, of, animals, to, focus, exclusively, on, human, artistry, circus, companies, and, artistes, within, this, movement, often, termed, new, circus, or, cirque, nouveau, have, tended, to, favour, a, theatrical, approach, combining, character, driven, circus, acts, with, original, music, in, a, broad, variety, of, styles, to, convey, complex, themes, or, stories, since, the, 1990s, a, more, avant, garde, approach, to, presenting, traditional, circus, techniques, or, disciplines, in, ways, that, align, more, closely, to, performance, art, dance, or, visual, arts, has, been, given, the, name, contemporary, circus, this, labelling, can, cause, confusion, based, upon, the, other, use, of, the, phrase, contemporary, circus, to, mean, circus, of, today, for, this, reason, some, commentators, have, begun, using, the, term, 21st, century, circus, to, encompass, all, the, various, styles, available, in, the, present, day, 21st, century, circus, continues, to, develop, new, variations, on, the, circus, tradition, while, absorbing, new, skills, techniques, and, stylistic, influences, from, other, art, forms, and, technological, developments, for, aesthetic, or, economic, reasons, 21st, century, circus, productions, may, often, be, staged, in, theatres, rather, than, in, large, outdoor, tents, first, attested, in, english, 14th, century, the, word, circus, derives, from, latin, circus, which, is, the, romanisation, of, the, greek, kirkos, itself, a, metathesis, of, the, homeric, greek, krikos, meaning, circle, or, ring, in, the, book, de, spectaculis, early, christian, writer, tertullian, claimed, that, the, first, circus, games, were, staged, by, the, goddess, circe, in, honour, of, her, father, helios, the, sun, god, the, modern, and, commonly, held, idea, of, a, circus, is, of, a, big, top, with, various, acts, providing, entertainment, therein, however, the, history, of, circuses, is, more, complex, with, historians, disagreeing, on, its, origin, as, well, as, revisions, being, done, about, the, history, due, to, the, changing, nature, of, historical, research, and, the, ongoing, circus, phenomenon, for, many, circus, history, begins, with, englishman, philip, astley, while, for, others, its, origins, go, back, much, further, to, roman, empire, times, in, ancient, rome, the, circus, was, a, roofless, arena, 2, for, the, exhibition, of, horse, and, chariot, races, equestrian, shows, staged, battles, gladiatorial, combat, and, displays, of, and, fights, with, trained, animals, the, circuses, of, rome, were, similar, to, the, ancient, greek, hippodromes, although, circuses, served, varying, purposes, and, differed, in, design, and, construction, and, for, events, that, involved, re, enactments, of, naval, battles, the, circus, was, flooded, with, water, however, the, roman, circus, buildings, were, not, circular, but, rectangular, with, semi, circular, ends, the, lower, seats, were, reserved, for, persons, of, rank, there, were, also, various, state, boxes, for, the, giver, of, the, games, and, his, friends, the, circus, was, the, only, public, spectacle, at, which, men, and, women, were, not, separated, some, circus, historians, such, as, george, speaight, have, stated, these, performances, may, have, taken, place, in, the, great, arenas, that, were, called, circuses, by, the, romans, but, it, is, a, mistake, to, equate, these, places, or, the, entertainments, presented, there, with, the, modern, circus, others, have, argued, that, the, lineage, of, the, circus, does, go, back, to, the, roman, circuses, and, a, chronology, of, circus, related, entertainment, can, be, traced, to, roman, times, continued, by, the, hippodrome, of, constantinople, that, operated, until, the, 13th, century, through, medieval, and, renaissance, jesters, minstrels, and, troubadours, to, the, late, 18th, century, and, the, time, of, astley, the, first, circus, in, the, city, of, rome, was, the, circus, maximus, in, the, valley, between, the, palatine, and, aventine, hills, it, was, constructed, during, the, monarchy, and, at, first, built, completely, from, wood, after, being, rebuilt, several, times, the, final, version, of, the, circus, maximus, could, seat, 250, 000, people, it, was, built, of, stone, and, measured, 400m, in, length, and, 90m, in, width, next, in, importance, were, the, circus, flaminius, and, the, circus, neronis, from, the, notoriety, which, it, obtained, through, the, circensian, pleasures, of, nero, a, fourth, circus, was, constructed, by, maxentius, its, ruins, have, helped, archaeologists, reconstruct, the, roman, circus, for, some, time, after, the, fall, of, rome, large, circus, buildings, fell, out, of, use, as, centres, of, mass, entertainment, instead, itinerant, performers, animal, trainers, and, showmen, travelled, between, towns, throughout, europe, performing, at, local, fairs, such, as, the, bartholomew, fair, in, london, during, the, middle, ages, 4, 6, the, origin, of, the, modern, circus, has, been, attributed, to, philip, astley, who, was, born, 1742, in, newcastle, under, lyme, england, he, became, a, cavalry, officer, who, set, up, the, first, modern, amphitheatre, for, the, display, of, horse, riding, tricks, in, lambeth, london, on, 4, april, 1768, astley, did, not, originate, trick, horse, riding, nor, was, he, first, to, introduce, acts, such, as, acrobats, and, clowns, to, the, english, public, but, he, was, the, first, to, create, a, space, where, all, these, acts, were, brought, together, to, perform, a, show, astley, rode, in, a, circle, rather, than, a, straight, line, as, his, rivals, did, and, thus, chanced, on, the, format, of, performing, in, a, circle, astley, performed, stunts, in, a, 42, ft, diameter, ring, which, is, the, standard, size, used, by, circuses, ever, since, astley, referred, to, the, performance, arena, as, a, circle, and, the, building, as, an, amphitheatre, these, would, later, be, known, as, a, circus, in, 1770, astley, hired, acrobats, tightrope, walkers, jugglers, and, a, clown, to, fill, in, the, pauses, between, acts, astley, was, followed, by, andrew, ducrow, whose, feats, of, horsemanship, had, much, to, do, with, establishing, the, traditions, of, the, circus, which, were, perpetuated, by, hengler, s, and, sanger, s, celebrated, shows, in, a, later, generation, in, england, circuses, were, often, held, in, purpose, built, buildings, in, large, cities, such, as, the, london, hippodrome, which, was, built, as, a, combination, of, the, circus, the, menagerie, and, the, variety, theatre, where, wild, animals, such, as, lions, and, elephants, from, time, to, time, appeared, in, the, ring, and, where, convulsions, of, nature, such, as, floods, earthquakes, and, volcanic, eruptions, were, produced, with, an, extraordinary, wealth, of, realistic, display, joseph, grimaldi, the, first, mainstream, clown, had, his, first, major, role, as, little, clown, in, the, pantomime, the, triumph, of, mirth, or,
