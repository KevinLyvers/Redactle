aesop, s, fables, or, the, aesopica, is, a, collection, of, fables, credited, to, aesop, a, slave, and, storyteller, who, lived, in, ancient, greece, between, 620, and, 564, bce, of, varied, and, unclear, origins, the, stories, associated, with, his, name, have, descended, to, modern, times, through, a, number, of, sources, and, continue, to, be, reinterpreted, in, different, verbal, registers, and, in, popular, as, well, as, artistic, media, the, fables, originally, belonged, to, oral, tradition, and, were, not, collected, for, some, three, centuries, after, aesop, s, death, by, that, time, a, variety, of, other, stories, jokes, and, proverbs, were, being, ascribed, to, him, although, some, of, that, material, was, from, sources, earlier, than, him, or, came, from, beyond, the, greek, cultural, sphere, the, process, of, inclusion, has, continued, until, the, present, with, some, of, the, fables, unrecorded, before, the, late, middle, ages, and, others, arriving, from, outside, europe, the, process, is, continuous, and, new, stories, are, still, being, added, to, the, aesop, corpus, even, when, they, are, demonstrably, more, recent, work, and, sometimes, from, known, authors, manuscripts, in, latin, and, greek, were, important, avenues, of, transmission, although, poetical, treatments, in, european, vernaculars, eventually, formed, another, on, the, arrival, of, printing, collections, of, aesop, s, fables, were, among, the, earliest, books, in, a, variety, of, languages, through, the, means, of, later, collections, and, translations, or, adaptations, of, them, aesop, s, reputation, as, a, fabulist, was, transmitted, throughout, the, world, initially, the, fables, were, addressed, to, adults, and, covered, religious, social, and, political, themes, they, were, also, put, to, use, as, ethical, guides, and, from, the, renaissance, onwards, were, particularly, used, for, the, education, of, children, their, ethical, dimension, was, reinforced, in, the, adult, world, through, depiction, in, sculpture, painting, and, other, illustrative, means, as, well, as, adaptation, to, drama, and, song, in, addition, there, have, been, reinterpretations, of, the, meaning, of, fables, and, changes, in, emphasis, over, time, apollonius, of, tyana, a, 1st, century, ce, philosopher, is, recorded, as, having, said, about, aesop, like, those, who, dine, well, off, the, plainest, dishes, he, made, use, of, humble, incidents, to, teach, great, truths, and, after, serving, up, a, story, he, adds, to, it, the, advice, to, do, a, thing, or, not, to, do, it, then, too, he, was, really, more, attached, to, truth, than, the, poets, are, for, the, latter, do, violence, to, their, own, stories, in, order, to, make, them, probable, but, he, by, announcing, a, story, which, everyone, knows, not, to, be, true, told, the, truth, by, the, very, fact, that, he, did, not, claim, to, be, relating, real, events, earlier, still, the, greek, historian, herodotus, mentioned, in, passing, that, aesop, the, fable, writer, ais, pou, to, logopoio, was, a, slave, who, lived, in, ancient, greece, during, the, 5th, century, bce, among, references, in, other, writers, aristophanes, in, his, comedy, the, wasps, represented, the, protagonist, philocleon, as, having, learnt, the, absurdities, of, aesop, from, conversation, at, banquets, plato, wrote, in, phaedo, that, socrates, whiled, away, his, time, in, prison, turning, some, of, aesop, s, fables, which, he, knew, into, verses, nonetheless, for, two, main, reasons, because, numerous, morals, within, aesop, s, attributed, fables, contradict, each, other, and, because, ancient, accounts, of, aesop, s, life, contradict, each, other, the, modern, view, is, that, aesop, was, not, the, originator, of, all, those, fables, attributed, to, him, instead, any, fable, tended, to, be, ascribed, to, the, name, of, aesop, if, there, was, no, known, alternative, literary, source, in, classical, times, there, were, various, theorists, who, tried, to, differentiate, these, fables, from, other, kinds, of, narration, they, had, to, be, short, and, unaffected, in, addition, they, are, fictitious, useful, to, life, and, true, to, nature, in, them, could, be, found, talking, animals, and, plants, although, humans, interacting, only, with, humans, figure, in, a, few, typically, they, might, begin, with, a, contextual, introduction, followed, by, the, story, often, with, the, moral, underlined, at, the, end, setting, the, context, was, often, necessary, as, a, guide, to, the, story, s, interpretation, as, in, the, case, of, the, political, meaning, of, the, frogs, who, desired, a, king, and, the, frogs, and, the, sun, sometimes, the, titles, given, later, to, the, fables, have, become, proverbial, as, in, the, case, of, killing, the, goose, that, laid, the, golden, eggs, or, the, town, mouse, and, the, country, mouse, in, fact, some, fables, such, as, the, young, man, and, the, swallow, appear, to, have, been, invented, as, illustrations, of, already, existing, proverbs, one, theorist, indeed, went, so, far, as, to, define, fables, as, extended, proverbs, in, this, they, have, an, aetiological, function, the, explaining, of, origins, such, as, in, another, context, why, the, ant, is, a, mean, thieving, creature, or, how, the, tortoise, got, its, shell, other, fables, also, verging, on, this, function, are, outright, jokes, as, in, the, case, of, the, old, woman, and, the, doctor, aimed, at, greedy, practitioners, of, medicine, the, contradictions, between, fables, already, mentioned, and, alternative, versions, of, much, the, same, fable, as, in, the, case, of, the, woodcutter, and, the, trees, are, best, explained, by, the, ascription, to, aesop, of, all, examples, of, the, genre, some, are, demonstrably, of, west, asian, origin, others, have, analogues, further, to, the, east, modern, scholarship, reveals, fables, and, proverbs, of, aesopic, form, existing, in, both, ancient, sumer, and, akkad, as, early, as, the, third, millennium, bce, aesop, s, fables, and, the, indian, tradition, as, represented, by, the, buddhist, jataka, tales, and, the, hindu, panchatantra, share, about, a, dozen, tales, in, common, although, often, widely, differing, in, detail, there, is, some, debate, over, whether, the, greeks, learned, these, fables, from, indian, storytellers, or, the, other, way, or, if, the, influences, were, mutual, loeb, editor, ben, e, perry, took, the, extreme, position, in, his, book, babrius, and, phaedrus, 1965, that, in, the, entire, greek, tradition, there, is, not, so, far, as, i, can, see, a, single, fable, that, can, be, said, to, come, either, directly, or, indirectly, from, an, indian, source, but, many, fables, or, fable, motifs, that, first, appear, in, greek, or, near, eastern, literature, are, found, later, in, the, panchatantra, and, other, indian, story, books, including, the, buddhist, jatakas, although, aesop, and, the, buddha, were, near, contemporaries, the, stories, of, neither, were, recorded, in, writing, until, some, centuries, after, their, death, few, disinterested, scholars, would, now, be, prepared, to, make, so, absolute, a, stand, as, perry, about, their, origin, in, view, of, the, conflicting, and, still, emerging, evidence, when, and, how, the, fables, arrived, in, and, travelled, from, ancient, greece, remains, uncertain, some, cannot, be, dated, any, earlier, than, babrius, and, phaedrus, several, centuries, after, aesop, and, yet, others, even, later, the, earliest, mentioned, collection, was, by, demetrius, of, phalerum, an, athenian, orator, and, statesman, of, the, 4th, century, bce, who, compiled, the, fables, into, a, set, of, ten, books, for, the, use, of, orators, a, follower, of, aristotle, he, simply, catalogued, all, the, fables, that, earlier, greek, writers, had, used, in, isolation, as, exempla, putting, them, into, prose, at, least, it, was, evidence, of, what, was, attributed, to, aesop, by, others, but, this, may, have, included, any, ascription, to, him, from, the, oral, tradition, in, the, way, of, animal, fables, fictitious, anecdotes, etiological, or, satirical, myths, possibly, even, any, proverb, or, joke, that, these, writers, transmitted, it, is, more, a, proof, of, the, power, of, aesop, s, name, to, attract, such, stories, to, it, than, evidence, of, his, actual, authorship, in, any, case, although, the, work, of, demetrius, was, mentioned, frequently, for, the, next, twelve, centuries, and, was, considered, the, official, aesop, no, copy, now, survives, present, day, collections, evolved, from, the, later, greek, version, of, babrius, of, which, there, now, exists, an, incomplete, manuscript, of, some, 160, fables, in, choliambic, verse, current, opinion, is, that, he, lived, in, the, 1st, century, ce, the, version, of, 55, fables, in, choliambic, tetrameters, by, the, 9th, century, ignatius, the, deacon, is, also, worth, mentioning, for, its, early, attribution, of, tales, from, oriental, sources, to, aesop, further, light, is, thrown, on, the, entry, of, oriental, stories, into, the, aesopic, canon, by, their, appearance, in, jewish, sources, such, as, the, talmud, and, in, midrashic, literature, there, is, a, comparative, list, of, these, on, the, jewish, encyclopedia, website, of, which, twelve, resemble, those, that, are, common, to, both, greek, and, indian, sources, six, are, parallel, to, those, only, in, indian, sources, and, six, others, in, greek, only, where, similar, fables, exist, in, greece, india, and, in, the, talmud, the, talmudic, form, approaches, more, nearly, the, indian, thus, the, fable, the, wolf, and, the, crane, is, told, in, india, of, a, lion, and, another, bird, when, joshua, ben, hananiah, told, that, fable, to, the, jews, to, prevent, their, rebelling, against, rome, and, once, more, putting, their, heads, into, the, lion, s, jaws, gen, r, lxiv, he, shows, familiarity, with, some, form, derived, from, india, the, first, extensive, translation, of, aesop, into, latin, iambic, trimeters, was, performed, by, phaedrus, a, freedman, of, augustus, in, the, 1st, century, ce, although, at, least, one, fable, had, already, been, translated, by, the, poet, ennius, two, centuries, before, and, others, are, referred, to, in, the, work, of, horace, the, rhetorician, aphthonius, of, antioch, wrote, a, technical, treatise, on, and, converted, into, latin, prose, some, forty, of, these, fables, in, 315, it, is, notable, as, illustrating, contemporary, and, later, usage, of, fables, in, rhetorical, practice, teachers, of, philosophy, and, rhetoric, often, set, the, fables, of, aesop, as, an, exercise, for, their, scholars, inviting, them, not, only, to, discuss, the, moral, of, the, tale, but, also, to, practise, style, and, the, rules, of, grammar, by, making, new, versions, of, their, own, a, little, later, the, poet, ausonius, handed, down, some, of, these, fables, in, verse, which, the, writer, julianus, titianus, translated, into, prose, and, in, the, early, 5th, century, avianus, put, 42, of, these, fables, into, latin, elegiacs, the, largest, oldest, known, and, most, influential, of, the, prose, versions, of, phaedrus, bears, the, name, of, an, otherwise, unknown, fabulist, named, romulus, it, contains, 83, fables, dates, from, the, 10th, century, and, seems, to, have, been, based, on, an, earlier, prose, version, which, under, the, name, of, aesop, and, addressed, to, one, rufus, may, have, been, written, in, the, carolingian, period, or, even, earlier, the, collection, became, the, source, from, which, during, the, second, half, of, the, middle, ages, almost, all, the, collections, of, latin, fables, in, prose, and, verse, were, wholly, or, partially, drawn, a, version, of, the, first, three, books, of, romulus, in, elegiac, verse, possibly, made, around, the, 12th, century, was, one, of, the, most, highly, influential, texts, in, medieval, europe, referred, to, variously, among, other, titles, as, the, verse, romulus, or, elegiac, romulus, and, ascribed, to, gualterus, anglicus, it, was, a, common, latin, teaching, text, and, was, popular, well, into, the, renaissance, another, version, of, romulus, in, latin, elegiacs, was, made, by, alexander, neckam, born, at, st, albans, in, 1157, interpretive, translations, of, the, elegiac, romulus, were, very, common, in, europe, in, the, middle, ages, among, the, earliest, was, one, in, the, 11th, century, by, ademar, of, chabannes, which, includes, some, new, material, this, was, followed, by, a, prose, collection, of, parables, by, the, cistercian, preacher, odo, of, cheriton, around, 1200, where, the, fables, many, of, which, are, not, aesopic, are, given, a, strong, medieval, and, clerical, tinge, this, interpretive, tendency, and, the, inclusion, of, yet, more, non, aesopic, material, was, to, grow, as, versions, in, the, various, european, vernaculars, began, to, appear, in, the, following, centuries, with, the, revival, of, literary, latin, during, the, renaissance, authors, began, compiling, collections, of, fables, in, which, those, traditionally, by, aesop, and, those, from, other, sources, appeared, side, by, side, one, of, the, earliest, was, by, lorenzo, bevilaqua, also, known, as, laurentius, abstemius, who, wrote, 197, fables, the, first, hundred, of, which, were, published, as, hecatomythium, in, 1495, little, by, aesop, was, included, at, the, most, some, traditional, fables, are, adapted, and, reinterpreted, the, lion, and, the, mouse, is, continued, and, given, a, new, ending, fable, 52, the, oak, and, the, reed, becomes, the, elm, and, the, willow, 53, the, ant, and, the, grasshopper, is, adapted, as, the, gnat, and, the, bee, 94, with, the, difference, that, the, gnat, offers, to, teach, music, to, the, bee, s, children, there, are, also, mediaeval, tales, such, as, the, mice, in, council, 195, and, stories, created, to, support, popular, proverbs, such, as, still, waters, run, deep, 5, and, a, woman, an, ass, and, a, walnut, tree, 65, where, the, latter, refers, back, to, aesop, s, fable, of, the, walnut, tree, most, of, the, fables, in, hecatomythium, were, later, translated, in, the, second, half, of, roger, l, estrange, s, fables, of, aesop, and, other, eminent, mythologists, 1692, some, also, appeared, among, the, 102, in, h, clarke, s, latin, reader, select, fables, of, aesop, with, an, english, translation, 1787, of, which, there, were, both, english, and, american, editions, there, were, later, three, notable, collections, of, fables, in, verse, among, which, the, most, influential, was, gabriele, faerno, s, centum, fabulae, 1564, the, majority, of, the, hundred, fables, there, are, aesop, s, but, there, are, also, humorous, tales, such, as, the, drowned, woman, and, her, husband, 41, and, the, miller, his, son, and, the, donkey, 100, in, the, same, year, that, faerno, was, published, in, italy, hieronymus, osius, brought, out, a, collection, of, 294, fables, titled, fabulae, aesopi, carmine, elegiaco, redditae, in, germany, this, too, contained, some, from, elsewhere, such, as, the, dog, in, the, manger, 67, then, in, 1604, the, austrian, pantaleon, weiss, known, as, pantaleon, candidus, published, centum, et, quinquaginta, fabulae, the, 152, poems, there, were, grouped, by, subject, with, sometimes, more, than, one, devoted, to, the, same, fable, although, presenting, alternative, versions, of, it, as, in, the, case, of, the, hawk, and, the, nightingale, 133, 5, it, also, includes, the, earliest, instance, of, the, lion, the, bear, and, the, fox, 60, in, a, language, other, than, greek, another, voluminous, collection, of, fables, in, latin, verse, was, anthony, alsop, s, fabularum, aesopicarum, delectus, oxford, 1698, the, bulk, of, the, 237, fables, there, are, prefaced, by, the, text, in, greek, while, there, are, also, a, handful, in, hebrew, and, in, arabic, the, final, fables, only, attested, from, latin, sources, are, without, other, versions, for, the, most, part, the, poems, are, confined, to, a, lean, telling, of, the, fable, without, drawing, a, moral, for, many, centuries, the, main, transmission, of, aesop, s, fables, across, europe, remained, in, latin, or, else, orally, in, various, vernaculars, where, they, mixed, with, folk, tales, derived, from, other, sources, this, mixing, is, often, apparent, in, early, vernacular, collections, of, fables, in, mediaeval, times, the, main, impetus, behind, the, translation, of, large, collections, of, fables, attributed, to, aesop, and, translated, into, european, languages, came, from, an, early, printed, publication, in, germany, there, had, been, many, small, selections, in, various, languages, during, the, middle, ages, but, the, first, attempt, at, an, exhaustive, edition, was, made, by, heinrich, steinh, wel, in, his, esopus, published, c, 1476, this, contained, both, latin, versions, and, german, translations, and, also, included, a, translation, of, rinuccio, da, castiglione, or, d, arezzo, s, version, from, the, greek, of, a, life, of, aesop, 1448, some, 156, fables, appear, collected, from, romulus, avianus, and, other, sources, accompanied, by, a, commentarial, preface, and, moralising, conclusion, and, 205, woodcuts, translations, or, versions, based, on, steinh, wel, s, book, followed, shortly, in, italian, 1479, french, 1480, english, the, caxton, edition, of, 1484, and, czech, in, about, 1488, these, were, many, times, reprinted, before, the, start, of, the, 16th, century, the, spanish, version, of, 1489, la, vida, del, ysopet, con, sus, fabulas, hystoriadas, was, equally, successful, and, often, reprinted, in, both, the, old, and, new, world, through, three, centuries, some, fables, were, later, treated, creatively, in, collections, of, their, own, by, authors, in, such, a, way, that, they, became, associated, with, their, names, rather, than, aesop, s, the, most, celebrated, were, la, fontaine, s, fables, published, in, french, during, the, later, 17th, century, inspired, by, the, brevity, and, simplicity, of, aesop, s, those, in, the, first, six, books, were, heavily, dependent, on, traditional, aesopic, material, fables, in, the, next, six, were, more, diffuse, and, diverse, in, origin, at, the, start, of, the, 19th, century, some, of, the, fables, were, adapted, into, russian, and, often, reinterpreted, by, the, fabulist, ivan, krylov, in, most, cases, but, not, all, these, were, dependent, on, la, fontaine, s, versions, translations, into, asian, languages, at, a, very, early, date, derive, originally, from, greek, sources, these, include, the, so, called, fables, of, syntipas, a, compilation, of, aesopic, fables, in, syriac, dating, from, the, 9, 11th, centuries, included, there, were, several, other, tales, of, possibly, west, asian, origin, in, central, asia, there, was, a, 10th, century, collection, of, the, fables, in, uighur, after, the, middle, ages, fables, largely, deriving, from, latin, sources, were, passed, on, by, europeans, as, part, of, their, colonial, or, missionary, enterprises, 47, fables, were, translated, into, the, nahuatl, language, in, the, late, 16th, century, under, the, title, in, zazanilli, in, esopo, the, work, of, a, native, translator, it, adapted, the, stories, to, fit, the, mexican, environment, incorporating, aztec, concepts, and, rituals, and, making, them, rhetorically, more, subtle, than, their, latin, source, portuguese, missionaries, arriving, in, japan, at, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, introduced, japan, to, the, fables, when, a, latin, edition, was, translated, into, romanized, japanese, the, title, was, esopo, no, fabulas, and, dates, to, 1593, it, was, soon, followed, by, a, fuller, translation, into, a, three, volume, kanaz, shi, entitled, isopo, monogatari, this, was, the, sole, western, work, to, survive, in, later, publication, after, the, expulsion, of, westerners, from, japan, since, by, that, time, the, figure, of, aesop, had, been, acculturated, and, presented, as, if, he, were, japanese, coloured, woodblock, editions, of, individual, fables, were, made, by, kawanabe, kyosai, in, the, 19th, century, the, first, translations, of, aesop, s, fables, into, the, chinese, languages, were, made, at, the, start, of, the, 17th, century, the, first, substantial, collection, being, of, 38, conveyed, orally, by, a, jesuit, missionary, named, nicolas, trigault, and, written, down, by, a, chinese, academic, named, zhang, geng, chinese, pinyin, zh, ng, g, ng, in, 1625, this, was, followed, two, centuries, later, by, yishi, yuyan, esop, s, fables, written, in, chinese, by, the, learned, mun, mooy, seen, shang, and, compiled, in, their, present, form, with, a, free, and, a, literal, translation, in, 1840, by, robert, thom, and, apparently, based, on, the, version, by, roger, l, estrange, this, work, was, initially, very, popular, until, someone, realised, the, fables, were, anti, authoritarian, and, the, book, was, banned,

patoises, by, antoine, bigot, 1825, 1897, followed, by, several, other, collections, of, fables, in, the, n, mes, dialect, between, 1881, and, 1891, alsatian, dialect, versions, of, la, fontaine, appeared, in, 1879, after, the, region, was, ceded, away, following, the, franco, prussian, war, at, the, end, of, the, following, century, brother, denis, joseph, sibler, 1920, 2002, published, a, collection, of, adaptations, first, recorded, in, 1983, that, has, gone, through, several, impressions, since, 1995, the, use, of, corsican, came, later, natale, rochicchioli, 1911, 2002, was, particularly, well, known, for, his, very, free, adaptations, of, la, fontaine, of, which, he, made, recordings, as, well, as, publishing, his, favule, di, natale, in, the, 1970s, during, the, 19th, century, renaissance, of, belgian, dialect, literature, in, walloon, several, authors, adapted, versions, of, the, fables, to, the, racy, speech, and, subject, matter, of, li, ge, they, included, charles, duvivier, in, 1842, joseph, lamaye, 1845, and, the, team, of, jean, joseph, dehin, and, fran, ois, bailleux, who, between, them, covered, all, of, la, fontaine, s, books, i, vi, f, ves, da, lafontaine, mettowes, ligeois, 1850, 56, adaptations, into, other, regional, dialects, were, made, by, charles, letellier, mons, 1842, and, charles, w, rotte, namur, 1844, much, later, l, on, bernus, published, some, hundred, imitations, of, la, fontaine, in, the, dialect, of, charleroi, 1872, he, was, followed, during, the, 1880s, by, joseph, dufrane, writing, in, the, borinage, dialect, under, the, pen, name, bosqu, tia, in, the, 20th, century, there, has, been, a, selection, of, fifty, fables, in, the, condroz, dialect, by, joseph, houziaux, 1946, to, mention, only, the, most, prolific, in, an, ongoing, surge, of, adaptation, the, motive, behind, the, later, activity, across, these, areas, was, to, assert, regional, specificity, against, a, growing, centralism, and, the, encroachment, of, the, language, of, the, capital, on, what, had, until, then, been, predominantly, monoglot, areas, surveying, its, literary, manifestations, commentators, have, noted, that, the, point, of, departure, of, the, individual, tales, is, not, as, important, as, what, they, become, in, the, process, even, in, the, hands, of, less, skilled, dialect, adaptations, la, fontaine, s, polished, versions, of, the, fables, are, returned, to, the, folkloristic, roots, by, which, they, often, came, to, him, in, the, first, places, but, many, of, the, gifted, regional, authors, were, well, aware, of, what, they, were, doing, in, their, work, in, fitting, the, narration, of, the, story, to, their, local, idiom, in, appealing, to, the, folk, proverbs, derived, from, such, tales, and, in, adapting, the, story, to, local, conditions, and, circumstances, the, fables, were, so, transposed, as, to, go, beyond, bare, equivalence, becoming, independent, works, in, their, own, right, thus, emile, ruben, claimed, of, the, linguistic, transmutations, in, jean, foucaud, s, collection, of, fables, that, not, content, with, translating, he, has, created, a, new, work, in, a, similar, way, the, critic, maurice, piron, described, the, walloon, versions, of, fran, ois, bailleux, as, masterpieces, of, original, imitation, and, this, is, echoed, in, the, claim, that, in, natale, rocchiccioli, s, free, corsican, versions, too, there, is, more, creation, than, adaptation, in, the, 20th, century, there, were, also, translations, into, regional, dialects, of, english, these, include, the, few, examples, in, addison, hibbard, s, aesop, in, negro, dialect, american, speech, 1926, and, the, 26, in, robert, stephen, s, fables, of, aesop, in, scots, verse, peterhead, scotland, 1987, translated, into, the, aberdeenshire, dialect, glasgow, university, has, also, been, responsible, for, r, w, smith, s, modernised, dialect, translation, of, robert, henryson, s, the, morall, fabillis, of, esope, the, phrygian, 1999, see, above, the, university, of, illinois, likewise, included, dialect, translations, by, norman, shapiro, in, its, creole, echoes, the, francophone, poetry, of, nineteenth, century, louisiana, 2004, see, below, such, adaptations, to, caribbean, french, based, creole, languages, from, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, onward, initially, as, part, of, the, colonialist, project, but, later, as, an, assertion, of, love, for, and, pride, in, the, dialect, a, version, of, la, fontaine, s, fables, in, the, dialect, of, martinique, was, made, by, fran, ois, achille, marbot, 1817, 1866, in, les, bambous, fables, de, la, fontaine, travesties, en, patois, cr, ole, port, royal, 1846, which, had, lasting, success, as, well, as, two, later, editions, in, martinique, there, were, two, more, published, in, france, in, 1870, and, 1885, and, others, in, the, 20th, century, later, dialect, fables, by, paul, baudot, 1801, 1870, from, neighbouring, guadeloupe, owed, nothing, to, la, fontaine, but, in, 1869, some, translated, examples, did, appear, in, a, grammar, of, trinidadian, french, creole, written, by, john, jacob, thomas, then, the, start, of, the, new, century, saw, the, publication, of, georges, sylvain, s, cric, crac, fables, de, la, fontaine, racont, es, par, un, montagnard, ha, tien, et, transcrites, en, vers, cr, oles, la, fontaine, s, fables, told, by, a, haiti, highlander, and, written, in, creole, verse, 1901, on, the, south, american, mainland, alfred, de, saint, quentin, published, a, selection, of, fables, freely, adapted, from, la, fontaine, into, guyanese, creole, in, 1872, this, was, among, a, collection, of, poems, and, stories, with, facing, translations, in, a, book, that, also, included, a, short, history, of, the, territory, and, an, essay, on, creole, grammar, on, the, other, side, of, the, caribbean, jules, choppin, 1830, 1914, was, adapting, la, fontaine, to, the, louisiana, slave, creole, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, in, versions, that, are, still, appreciated, the, new, orleans, author, edgar, grima, 1847, 1939, also, adapted, la, fontaine, into, both, standard, french, and, into, dialect, versions, in, the, french, creole, of, the, islands, in, the, indian, ocean, began, somewhat, earlier, than, in, the, caribbean, louis, h, ry, 1801, 1856, emigrated, from, brittany, to, r, union, in, 1820, having, become, a, schoolmaster, he, adapted, some, of, la, fontaine, s, fables, into, the, local, dialect, in, fables, cr, oles, d, di, es, aux, dames, de, l, le, bourbon, creole, fables, for, island, women, this, was, published, in, 1829, and, went, through, three, editions, in, addition, 49, fables, of, la, fontaine, were, adapted, to, the, seychelles, dialect, around, 1900, by, rodolphine, young, 1860, 1932, but, these, remained, unpublished, until, 1983, jean, louis, robert, s, recent, translation, of, babrius, into, r, union, creole, 2007, adds, a, further, motive, for, such, adaptation, fables, began, as, an, expression, of, the, slave, culture, and, their, background, is, in, the, simplicity, of, agrarian, life, creole, transmits, this, experience, with, greater, purity, than, the, urbane, language, of, the, slave, owner, more, recently, still, there, has, been, ezop, pou, zanfan, lekol, 2017, free, adaptations, of, 125, fables, into, mauritian, creole, by, dev, virahsawmy, accompanied, by, english, texts, drawn, from, the, aesop, for, children, 1919, fables, belong, essentially, to, the, oral, tradition, they, survive, by, being, remembered, and, then, retold, in, one, s, own, words, when, they, are, written, down, particularly, in, the, dominant, language, of, instruction, they, lose, something, of, their, essence, a, strategy, for, reclaiming, them, is, therefore, to, exploit, the, gap, between, the, written, and, the, spoken, language, one, of, those, who, did, this, in, english, was, sir, roger, l, estrange, who, translated, the, fables, into, the, racy, urban, slang, of, his, day, and, further, underlined, their, purpose, by, including, in, his, collection, many, of, the, subversive, latin, fables, of, laurentius, abstemius, in, france, the, fable, tradition, had, already, been, renewed, in, the, 17th, century, by, la, fontaine, s, influential, reinterpretations, of, aesop, and, others, in, the, centuries, that, followed, there, were, further, reinterpretations, through, the, medium, of, regional, languages, which, to, those, at, the, centre, were, regarded, as, little, better, than, slang, eventually, however, the, demotic, tongue, of, the, cities, themselves, began, to, be, appreciated, as, a, literary, medium, one, of, the, earliest, examples, of, these, urban, slang, translations, was, the, series, of, individual, fables, contained, in, a, single, folded, sheet, appearing, under, the, title, of, les, fables, de, gibbs, in, 1929, others, written, during, the, period, were, eventually, anthologised, as, fables, de, la, fontaine, en, argot, toile, sur, rh, ne, 1989, this, followed, the, genre, s, growth, in, popularity, after, world, war, ii, two, short, selections, of, fables, by, bernard, gelval, about, 1945, were, succeeded, by, two, selections, of, 15, fables, each, by, marcus, paris, 1947, reprinted, in, 1958, and, 2006, api, condret, s, recueil, des, fables, en, argot, paris, 1951, and, g, o, sandry, 1897, 1975, and, jean, kolb, s, fables, en, argot, paris, 1950, 60, the, majority, of, such, printings, were, privately, produced, leaflets, and, pamphlets, often, sold, by, entertainers, at, their, performances, and, are, difficult, to, date, some, of, these, poems, then, entered, the, repertoire, of, noted, performers, such, as, boby, forest, and, yves, deniaud, of, which, recordings, were, made, in, the, south, of, france, georges, goudon, published, numerous, folded, sheets, of, fables, in, the, post, war, period, described, as, monologues, they, use, lyon, slang, and, the, mediterranean, lingua, franca, known, as, sabir, slang, versions, by, others, continue, to, be, produced, in, various, parts, of, france, both, in, printed, and, recorded, form, the, first, printed, version, of, aesop, s, fables, in, english, was, published, on, 26, march, 1484, by, william, caxton, many, others, in, prose, and, verse, followed, over, the, centuries, in, the, 20th, century, ben, e, perry, edited, the, aesopic, fables, of, babrius, and, phaedrus, for, the, loeb, classical, library, and, compiled, a, numbered, index, by, type, in, 1952, olivia, and, robert, temple, s, penguin, edition, is, titled, the, complete, fables, by, aesop, 1998, but, in, fact, many, from, babrius, phaedrus, and, other, major, ancient, sources, have, been, omitted, more, recently, in, 2002, a, translation, by, laura, gibbs, titled, aesop, s, fables, was, published, by, oxford, world, s, classics, this, book, includes, 359, and, has, selections, from, all, the, major, greek, and, latin, sources, until, the, 18th, century, the, fables, were, largely, put, to, adult, use, by, teachers, preachers, speech, makers, and, moralists, it, was, the, philosopher, john, locke, who, first, seems, to, have, advocated, targeting, children, as, a, special, audience, in, some, thoughts, concerning, education, 1693, aesop, s, fables, in, his, opinion, are, apt, to, delight, and, entertain, a, child, yet, afford, useful, reflection, to, a, grown, man, and, if, his, memory, retain, them, all, his, life, after, he, will, not, repent, to, find, them, there, amongst, his, manly, thoughts, and, serious, business, if, his, aesop, has, pictures, in, it, it, will, entertain, him, much, better, and, encourage, him, to, read, when, it, carries, the, increase, of, knowledge, with, it, for, such, visible, objects, children, hear, talked, of, in, vain, and, without, any, satisfaction, whilst, they, have, no, ideas, of, them, those, ideas, being, not, to, be, had, from, sounds, but, from, the, things, themselves, or, their, pictures, that, young, people, are, a, special, target, for, the, fables, was, not, a, particularly, new, idea, and, a, number, of, ingenious, schemes, for, catering, to, that, audience, had, already, been, put, into, practice, in, europe, the, centum, fabulae, of, gabriele, faerno, was, commissioned, by, pope, pius, iv, in, the, 16th, century, so, that, children, might, learn, at, the, same, time, and, from, the, same, book, both, moral, and, linguistic, purity, when, king, louis, xiv, of, france, wanted, to, instruct, his, six, year, old, son, he, incorporated, the, series, of, hydraulic, statues, representing, 38, chosen, fables, in, the, labyrinth, of, versailles, in, the, 1670s, in, this, he, had, been, advised, by, charles, perrault, who, was, later, to, translate, faerno, s, widely, published, latin, poems, into, french, verse, and, so, bring, them, to, a, wider, audience, then, in, the, 1730s, appeared, the, eight, volumes, of, nouvelles, po, sies, spirituelles, et, morales, sur, les, plus, beaux, airs, the, first, six, of, which, incorporated, a, section, of, fables, specifically, aimed, at, children, in, this, the, fables, of, la, fontaine, were, rewritten, to, fit, popular, airs, of, the, day, and, arranged, for, simple, performance, the, preface, to, this, work, comments, that, we, consider, ourselves, happy, if, in, giving, them, an, attraction, to, useful, lessons, which, are, suited, to, their, age, we, have, given, them, an, aversion, to, the, profane, songs, which, are, often, put, into, their, mouths, and, which, only, serve, to, corrupt, their, innocence, the, work, was, popular, and, reprinted, into, the, following, century, in, great, britain, various, authors, began, to, develop, this, new, market, in, the, 18th, century, giving, a, brief, outline, of, the, story, and, what, was, usually, a, longer, commentary, on, its, moral, and, practical, meaning, the, first, of, such, works, is, reverend, samuel, croxall, s, fables, of, aesop, and, others, newly, done, into, english, with, an, application, to, each, fable, first, published, in, 1722, with, engravings, for, each, fable, by, elisha, kirkall, it, was, continually, reprinted, into, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, another, popular, collection, was, john, newbery, s, fables, in, verse, for, the, improvement, of, the, young, and, the, old, facetiously, attributed, to, abraham, aesop, esquire, which, was, to, see, ten, editions, after, its, first, publication, in, 1757, robert, dodsley, s, three, volume, select, fables, of, esop, and, other, fabulists, is, distinguished, for, several, reasons, first, that, it, was, printed, in, birmingham, by, john, baskerville, in, 1761, second, that, it, appealed, to, children, by, having, the, animals, speak, in, character, the, lion, in, regal, style, the, owl, with, pomp, of, phrase, thirdly, because, it, gathers, into, three, sections, fables, from, ancient, sources, those, that, are, more, recent, including, some, borrowed, from, jean, de, la, fontaine, and, new, stories, of, his, own, invention, thomas, bewick, s, editions, from, newcastle, upon, tyne, are, equally, distinguished, for, the, quality, of, his, woodcuts, the, first, of, those, under, his, name, was, the, select, fables, in, three, parts, published, in, 1784, this, was, followed, in, 1818, by, the, fables, of, aesop, and, others, the, work, is, divided, into, three, sections, the, first, has, some, of, dodsley, s, fables, prefaced, by, a, short, prose, moral, the, second, has, fables, with, reflections, in, which, each, story, is, followed, by, a, prose, and, a, verse, moral, and, then, a, lengthy, prose, reflection, the, third, fables, in, verse, includes, fables, from, other, sources, in, poems, by, several, unnamed, authors, in, these, the, moral, is, incorporated, into, the, body, of, the, poem, in, the, early, 19th, century, authors, turned, to, writing, verse, specifically, for, children, and, included, fables, in, their, output, one, of, the, most, popular, was, the, writer, of, nonsense, verse, richard, scrafton, sharpe, died, 1852, whose, old, friends, in, a, new, dress, familiar, fables, in, verse, first, appeared, in, 1807, and, went, through, five, steadily, augmented, editions, until, 1837, jefferys, taylor, s, aesop, in, rhyme, with, some, originals, first, published, in, 1820, was, as, popular, and, also, went, through, several, editions, the, versions, are, lively, but, taylor, takes, considerable, liberties, with, the, story, line, both, authors, were, alive, to, the, over, serious, nature, of, the, 18th, century, collections, and, tried, to, remedy, this, sharpe, in, particular, discussed, the, dilemma, they, presented, and, recommended, a, way, round, it, tilting, at, the, same, time, at, the, format, in, croxall, s, fable, collection, it, has, been, the, accustomed, method, in, printing, fables, to, divide, the, moral, from, the, subject, and, children, whose, minds, are, alive, to, the, entertainment, of, an, amusing, story, too, often, turn, from, one, fable, to, another, rather, than, peruse, the, less, interesting, lines, that, come, under, the, term, application, it, is, with, this, conviction, that, the, author, of, the, present, selection, has, endeavoured, to, interweave, the, moral, with, the, subject, that, the, story, shall, not, be, obtained, without, the, benefit, arising, from, it, and, that, amusement, and, instruction, may, go, hand, in, hand, sharpe, s, limerick, versions, of, aesop, s, fables, appeared, in, 1887, this, was, in, a, magnificently, hand, produced, arts, and, crafts, movement, edition, the, baby, s, own, aesop, being, the, fables, condensed, in, rhyme, with, portable, morals, pictorially, pointed, by, walter, crane, some, later, prose, editions, were, particularly, notable, for, their, illustrations, among, these, was, aesop, s, fables, a, new, version, chiefly, from, original, sources, 1848, by, thomas, james, with, more, than, one, hundred, illustrations, designed, by, john, tenniel, tenniel, himself, did, not, think, highly, of, his, work, there, and, took, the, opportunity, to, redraw, some, in, the, revised, edition, of, 1884, which, also, used, pictures, by, ernest, griset, and, harrison, weir, once, the, technology, was, in, place, for, coloured, reproductions, illustrations, became, ever, more, attractive, notable, early, 20th, century, editions, include, v, s, vernon, jones, new, translation, of, the, fables, accompanied, by, the, pictures, of, arthur, rackham, london, 1912, and, in, the, us, aesop, for, children, chicago, 1919, illustrated, by, milo, winter, the, illustrations, from, croxall, s, editions, were, an, early, inspiration, for, other, artefacts, aimed, at, children, in, the, 18th, century, they, appear, on, tableware, from, the, chelsea, wedgwood, and, fenton, potteries, for, example, 19th, century, examples, with, a, definitely, educational, aim, include, the, fable, series, used, on, the, alphabet, plates, issued, in, great, numbers, from, the, brownhills, pottery, in, staffordshire, fables, were, used, equally, early, in, the, design, of, tiles, to, surround, the, nursery, fireplace, the, latter, were, even, more, popular, in, the, 19th, century, when, there, were, specially, designed, series, from, mintons, minton, hollins, and, maw, co, in, france, too, well, known, illustrations, of, la, fontaine, s, fables, were, often, used, on, china, in, classical, times, there, was, an, overlap, between, fable, and, myth, especially, where, they, had, an, aetiological, function, among, those, are, two, which, deal, with, the, difference, between, humans, and, animals, according, to, the, first, humans, are, distinguished, by, their, rationality, but, in, those, cases, where, they, have, a, bestial, mentality, the, explanation, is, that, at, creation, animals, were, found, to, outnumber, humans, and, some, were, therefore, modified, in, shape, but, retained, their, animal, souls, such, early, philosophical, speculation, was, also, extended, to, the, ethical, problems, connected, with, divine, justice, for, example, it, was, perceived, as, disproportionate, for, an, evil, man, to, be, punished, by, dying, in, a, shipwreck, when, it, involved, many, other, innocent, people, the, god, hermes, explained, this, to, an, objector, by, the, human, analogy, of, a, man, bitten, by, an, ant, and, in, consequence, stamping, on, all, those, about, his, feet, again, it, was, asked, why, the, consequences, of, an, evil, deed, did, not, follow, immediately, it, was, committed, hermes, was, involved, here, too, since, he, records, men, s, acts, on, potsherds, and, takes, them, to, zeus, piled, in, a, box, the, god, of, justice, however, goes, through, them, in, reverse, order, and, the, penalty, may, therefore, be, delayed, however, where, the, fault, is, perceived, as, an, act, of, defiance, as, happens, in, the, fable, of, horkos, retribution, arrives, swiftly, some, fables, may, express, open, scepticism, as, in, the, story, of, the, man, marketing, a, statue, of, hermes, who, boasted, of, its, effectiveness, asked, why, he, was, disposing, of, such, an, asset, the, huckster, explains, that, the, god, takes, his, time, in, granting, favours, while, he, himself, needs, immediate, cash, in, another, example, a, farmer, whose, mattock, has, been, stolen, goes, to, a, temple, to, see, if, the, culprit, can, be, found, by, divination, on, his, arrival, he, hears, an, announcement, asking, for, information, about, a, robbery, at, the, temple, and, concludes, that, a, god, who, cannot, look, after, his, own, must, be, useless, but, the, contrary, position, against, reliance, on, religious, ritual, was, taken, in, fables, like, hercules, and, the, wagoner, that, illustrate, the, proverb, god, helps, those, who, help, themselves, the, story, was, also, to, become, a, favourite, centuries, later, in, protestant, england, where, one, commentator, took, the, extreme, position, that, to, neglect, the, necessity, of, self, help, is, blasphemy, and, that, it, is, a, great, sin, for, a, man, to, fail, in, his, trade, or, occupation, by, running, often, to, prayers, as, the, fables, moved, out, of, the, greek, speaking, world, and, were, adapted, to, different, times, and, religions, it, is, notable, how, radically, some, fables, were, reinterpreted, thus, one, of, the, fables, collected, under, the, title, of, the, lion, s, share, and, originally, directed, against, tyranny, became, in, the, hands, of, rumi, a, parable, of, oneness, with, the, god, of, islam, and, obedience, to, divine, authority, in, the, jewish, fox, fables, of, berechiah, ha, nakdan, the, humorous, account, of, the, hares, and, the, frogs, was, made, the, occasion, to, recommend, trust, in, god, while, christian, reinterpretation, of, animal, symbolism, in, mediaeval, times, turned, the, wolf, and, the, crane, into, a, parable, of, the, rescue, of, the, sinner, s, soul, from, hell, in, mediaeval, times, too, fables, were, collected, for, use, in, sermons, of, which, odo, of, cheriton, s, parobolae, is, just, one, example, at, the, start, of, the, reformation, martin, luther, followed, his, example, in, the, work, now, known, as, the, coburg,
