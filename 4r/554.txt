textile, arts, are, arts, and, crafts, that, use, plant, animal, or, synthetic, fibers, to, construct, practical, or, decorative, objects, textiles, have, been, a, fundamental, part, of, human, life, since, the, beginning, of, civilization, the, methods, and, materials, used, to, make, them, have, expanded, enormously, while, the, functions, of, textiles, have, remained, the, same, there, are, many, functions, for, textiles, whether, it, be, clothing, or, something, decorative, for, the, house, shelter, the, history, of, textile, arts, is, also, the, history, of, international, trade, tyrian, purple, dye, was, an, important, trade, good, in, the, ancient, mediterranean, the, silk, road, brought, chinese, silk, to, india, africa, and, europe, and, conversely, sogdian, silk, to, china, tastes, for, imported, luxury, fabrics, led, to, sumptuary, laws, during, the, middle, ages, and, renaissance, the, industrial, revolution, was, shaped, largely, by, innovation, in, textiles, technology, the, cotton, gin, the, spinning, jenny, and, the, power, loom, mechanized, production, and, led, to, the, luddite, rebellion, the, word, textile, is, from, latin, texere, which, means, to, weave, to, braid, or, to, construct, the, simplest, textile, art, is, felting, in, which, animal, fibers, are, matted, together, using, heat, and, moisture, most, textile, arts, begin, with, twisting, or, spinning, and, plying, fibers, to, make, yarn, called, thread, when, it, is, very, fine, and, rope, when, it, is, very, heavy, the, yarn, is, then, knotted, looped, braided, or, woven, to, make, flexible, fabric, or, cloth, and, cloth, can, be, used, to, make, clothing, and, soft, furnishings, all, of, these, items, felt, yarn, fabric, and, finished, objects, are, collectively, referred, to, as, textiles, the, textile, arts, also, include, those, techniques, which, are, used, to, embellish, or, decorate, textiles, dyeing, and, printing, to, add, color, and, pattern, embroidery, and, other, types, of, needlework, tablet, weaving, and, lace, making, construction, methods, such, as, sewing, knitting, crochet, and, tailoring, as, well, as, the, tools, employed, looms, and, sewing, needles, techniques, employed, quilting, and, pleating, and, the, objects, made, carpets, kilims, hooked, rugs, and, coverlets, all, fall, under, the, category, of, textile, arts, from, early, times, textiles, have, been, used, to, cover, the, human, body, and, protect, it, from, the, elements, to, send, social, cues, to, other, people, to, store, secure, and, protect, possessions, and, to, soften, insulate, and, decorate, living, spaces, and, surfaces, the, persistence, of, ancient, textile, arts, and, functions, and, their, elaboration, for, decorative, effect, can, be, seen, in, a, jacobean, era, portrait, of, henry, frederick, prince, of, wales, by, robert, peake, the, elder, above, the, prince, s, capotain, hat, is, made, of, felt, using, the, most, basic, of, textile, techniques, his, clothing, is, made, of, woven, cloth, richly, embroidered, in, silk, and, his, stockings, are, knitted, he, stands, on, an, oriental, rug, of, wool, which, softens, and, warms, the, floor, and, heavy, curtains, both, decorate, the, room, and, block, cold, drafts, from, the, window, goldwork, embroidery, on, the, tablecloth, and, curtains, proclaim, the, status, of, the, home, s, owner, in, the, same, way, that, the, felted, fur, hat, sheer, linen, shirt, trimmed, with, reticella, lace, and, opulent, embroidery, on, the, prince, s, clothes, proclaim, his, social, position, traditionally, the, term, art, was, used, to, refer, to, any, skill, or, mastery, a, concept, which, altered, during, the, romantic, period, of, the, nineteenth, century, when, art, came, to, be, seen, as, a, special, faculty, of, the, human, mind, to, be, classified, with, religion, and, science, this, distinction, between, craft, and, fine, art, is, applied, to, the, textile, arts, as, well, where, the, term, fiber, art, or, textile, art, is, now, used, to, describe, textile, based, decorative, objects, which, are, not, intended, for, practical, use, natural, fibers, have, been, an, important, aspect, of, human, society, since, 7000, b, c, and, it, is, suspected, that, they, were, first, used, in, ornamental, cloths, since, 400, b, c, in, india, where, cotton, was, first, grown, natural, fibers, have, been, used, for, the, past, 4000, to, 5000, years, to, make, cloth, and, plant, and, animal, fibers, were, the, only, way, that, clothing, and, fabrics, could, be, created, up, until, 1885, when, the, first, synthetic, fiber, was, made, cotton, and, flax, are, two, of, the, most, common, natural, fibers, that, are, used, today, but, historically, natural, fibers, were, made, of, most, parts, of, the, plant, including, bark, stem, leaf, fruit, seed, hairs, and, sap, flax, is, believed, to, be, the, oldest, fiber, that, was, used, to, create, textiles, as, it, was, found, in, the, tombs, of, mummies, from, as, early, as, 6500, b, c, the, fibers, from, the, flax, are, taken, from, the, filaments, in, the, stem, of, the, plant, spun, together, to, create, long, strands, and, then, woven, into, long, pieces, of, linen, that, were, used, from, anything, from, bandages, to, clothing, and, tapestries, each, fiber, s, length, depends, on, the, height, of, the, leaf, that, it, is, serving, with, 10, filaments, in, a, bundle, serving, each, leaf, on, the, plant, each, filament, is, the, same, thickness, giving, it, a, consistency, that, is, ideal, for, spinning, yarn, the, yarn, was, best, used, on, warping, boards, or, warping, reels, to, create, large, pieces, of, cloth, that, could, be, dyed, and, woven, into, different, patterns, to, create, elaborate, tapestries, and, embroideries, one, example, of, how, linen, was, used, is, in, the, picture, of, a, bandage, that, a, mummy, was, wrapped, in, dated, between, 305, and, 30, b, c, some, of, the, bandages, were, painted, with, hieroglyphs, if, the, person, being, buried, was, of, importance, to, the, community, cotton, was, first, used, in, 5000, b, c, in, india, and, the, middle, east, and, spread, to, europe, after, they, invaded, india, in, 327, b, c, the, manufacture, and, production, of, cotton, spread, rapidly, in, the, 18th, century, and, it, quickly, became, one, of, the, most, important, textile, fibers, because, of, its, comfort, durability, and, absorbency, cotton, fibers, are, seed, hairs, formed, in, a, capsule, that, grows, after, the, plant, flowers, the, fibers, complete, their, growth, cycle, and, burst, to, release, about, 30, seeds, that, each, have, between, 200, and, 7000, seed, hairs, that, are, between, 22, and, 50, millimeters, long, about, 90, of, the, seed, hairs, are, cellulose, with, the, other, 10, being, wax, pectate, protein, and, other, minerals, once, it, is, processed, cotton, can, be, spun, into, yarn, of, various, thicknesses, to, be, woven, or, knitted, into, various, different, products, such, as, velvet, chambray, corduroy, jersey, flannel, and, velour, that, can, be, used, in, clothing, tapestries, rugs, and, drapes, as, shown, in, the, image, of, the, cotton, tapestry, that, was, woven, in, india, light, microscopy, normal, transmission, electron, microscopy, and, most, recently, scanning, electron, microscopy, sem, are, used, to, study, ancient, textile, remains, to, determine, what, natural, fibers, were, used, to, create, them, once, textiles, are, found, the, fibers, are, teased, out, using, a, light, microscope, and, an, sem, is, used, to, look, for, characteristics, in, the, textile, that, show, what, plant, it, is, made, of, in, flax, for, example, scientists, look, for, longitudinal, striations, that, show, the, cells, of, the, plant, stem, and, cross, striations, and, nodes, that, are, specific, to, flax, fibers, cotton, is, identified, by, the, twist, that, occurs, in, the, seed, hairs, when, the, fibers, are, dried, to, be, woven, this, knowledge, helps, us, to, learn, where, and, when, the, cultivation, of, plants, that, are, used, in, textiles, first, occurred, confirming, the, previous, knowledge, that, was, gained, from, studying, the, era, in, which, different, textile, arts, aligned, with, from, a, perspective, of, design, while, plant, use, in, textile, art, is, still, common, today, there, are, new, innovations, being, developed, such, as, suzanne, lee, s, art, installation, biocouture, lee, uses, fermentation, to, create, a, plant, based, paper, sheet, that, can, be, cut, and, sewn, just, like, cloth, ranging, in, thickness, from, thin, plastic, like, materials, up, to, thick, leather, like, sheets, the, garments, are, disposable, because, they, are, made, entirely, of, plant, based, products, and, are, completely, biodegradable, within, her, project, lee, places, a, large, emphasis, on, making, the, clothing, look, fashionable, by, using, avant, garde, style, and, natural, dyes, made, from, fruits, because, compostable, clothing, is, not, appealing, to, most, shoppers, in, addition, there, is, a, possibility, to, create, designs, with, the, plants, by, tearing, or, cutting, the, growing, sheet, and, allowing, it, to, heal, to, create, a, pattern, made, of, scars, on, the, textile, the, possibilities, to, use, this, textile, in, art, installations, is, incredible, because, artists, would, have, the, ability, to, create, a, living, art, piece, such, as, lee, does, with, her, clothing
