ancient, greek, art, stands, out, among, that, of, other, ancient, cultures, for, its, development, of, naturalistic, but, idealized, depictions, of, the, human, body, in, which, largely, nude, male, figures, were, generally, the, focus, of, innovation, the, rate, of, stylistic, development, between, about, 750, and, 300, bc, was, remarkable, by, ancient, standards, and, in, surviving, works, is, best, seen, in, sculpture, there, were, important, innovations, in, painting, which, have, to, be, essentially, reconstructed, due, to, the, lack, of, original, survivals, of, quality, other, than, the, distinct, field, of, painted, pottery, greek, architecture, technically, very, simple, established, a, harmonious, style, with, numerous, detailed, conventions, that, were, largely, adopted, by, roman, architecture, and, are, still, followed, in, some, modern, buildings, it, used, a, vocabulary, of, ornament, that, was, shared, with, pottery, metalwork, and, other, media, and, had, an, enormous, influence, on, eurasian, art, especially, after, buddhism, carried, it, beyond, the, expanded, greek, world, created, by, alexander, the, great, the, social, context, of, greek, art, included, radical, political, developments, and, a, great, increase, in, prosperity, the, equally, impressive, greek, achievements, in, philosophy, literature, and, other, fields, are, well, known, the, earliest, art, by, greeks, is, generally, excluded, from, ancient, greek, art, and, instead, known, as, greek, neolithic, art, followed, by, aegean, art, the, latter, includes, cycladic, art, and, the, art, of, the, minoan, and, mycenaean, cultures, from, the, greek, bronze, age, the, art, of, ancient, greece, is, usually, divided, stylistically, into, four, periods, the, geometric, archaic, classical, and, hellenistic, the, geometric, age, is, usually, dated, from, about, 1000, bc, although, in, reality, little, is, known, about, art, in, greece, during, the, preceding, 200, years, traditionally, known, as, the, greek, dark, ages, the, 7th, century, bc, witnessed, the, slow, development, of, the, archaic, style, as, exemplified, by, the, black, figure, style, of, vase, painting, around, 500, bc, shortly, before, the, onset, of, the, persian, wars, 480, bc, to, 448, bc, is, usually, taken, as, the, dividing, line, between, the, archaic, and, the, classical, periods, and, the, reign, of, alexander, the, great, 336, bc, to, 323, bc, is, taken, as, separating, the, classical, from, the, hellenistic, periods, from, some, point, in, the, 1st, century, bc, onwards, greco, roman, is, used, or, more, local, terms, for, the, eastern, greek, world, in, reality, there, was, no, sharp, transition, from, one, period, to, another, forms, of, art, developed, at, different, speeds, in, different, parts, of, the, greek, world, and, as, in, any, age, some, artists, worked, in, more, innovative, styles, than, others, strong, local, traditions, and, the, requirements, of, local, cults, enable, historians, to, locate, the, origins, even, of, works, of, art, found, far, from, their, place, of, origin, greek, art, of, various, kinds, was, widely, exported, the, whole, period, saw, a, generally, steady, increase, in, prosperity, and, trading, links, within, the, greek, world, and, with, neighbouring, cultures, the, survival, rate, of, greek, art, differs, starkly, between, media, we, have, huge, quantities, of, pottery, and, coins, much, stone, sculpture, though, even, more, roman, copies, and, a, few, large, bronze, sculptures, almost, entirely, missing, are, painting, fine, metal, vessels, and, anything, in, perishable, materials, including, wood, the, stone, shell, of, a, number, of, temples, and, theatres, has, survived, but, little, of, their, extensive, decoration, by, convention, finely, painted, vessels, of, all, shapes, are, called, vases, and, there, are, over, 100, 000, significantly, complete, surviving, pieces, giving, with, the, inscriptions, that, many, carry, unparalleled, insights, into, many, aspects, of, greek, life, sculptural, or, architectural, pottery, also, very, often, painted, are, referred, to, as, terracottas, and, also, survive, in, large, quantities, in, much, of, the, literature, pottery, means, only, painted, vessels, or, vases, pottery, was, the, main, form, of, grave, goods, deposited, in, tombs, often, as, funerary, urns, containing, the, cremated, ashes, and, was, widely, exported, the, famous, and, distinctive, style, of, greek, vase, painting, with, figures, depicted, with, strong, outlines, with, thin, lines, within, the, outlines, reached, its, peak, from, about, 600, to, 350, bc, and, divides, into, the, two, main, styles, almost, reversals, of, each, other, of, black, figure, and, red, figure, painting, the, other, colour, forming, the, background, in, each, case, other, colours, were, very, limited, normally, to, small, areas, of, white, and, larger, ones, of, a, different, purplish, red, within, the, restrictions, of, these, techniques, and, other, strong, conventions, vase, painters, achieved, remarkable, results, combining, refinement, and, powerful, expression, white, ground, technique, allowed, more, freedom, in, depiction, but, did, not, wear, well, and, was, mostly, made, for, burial, conventionally, the, ancient, greeks, are, said, to, have, made, most, pottery, vessels, for, everyday, use, not, for, display, exceptions, are, the, large, archaic, monumental, vases, made, as, grave, markers, trophies, won, at, games, such, as, the, panathenaic, amphorae, filled, with, olive, oil, and, pieces, made, specifically, to, be, left, in, graves, some, perfume, bottles, have, a, money, saving, bottom, just, below, the, mouth, so, a, small, quantity, makes, them, appear, full, in, recent, decades, many, scholars, have, questioned, this, seeing, much, more, production, than, was, formerly, thought, as, made, to, be, placed, in, graves, as, a, cheaper, substitute, for, metalware, in, both, greece, and, etruria, most, surviving, pottery, consists, of, vessels, for, storing, serving, or, drinking, liquids, such, as, amphorae, kraters, bowls, for, mixing, wine, and, water, hydria, water, jars, libation, bowls, oil, and, perfume, bottles, for, the, toilet, jugs, and, cups, painted, vessels, for, serving, and, eating, food, are, much, less, common, painted, pottery, was, affordable, even, by, ordinary, people, and, a, piece, decently, decorated, with, about, five, or, six, figures, cost, about, two, or, three, days, wages, miniatures, were, also, produced, in, large, numbers, mainly, for, use, as, offerings, at, temples, in, the, hellenistic, period, a, wider, range, of, pottery, was, produced, but, most, of, it, is, of, little, artistic, importance, in, earlier, periods, even, quite, small, greek, cities, produced, pottery, for, their, own, locale, these, varied, widely, in, style, and, standards, distinctive, pottery, that, ranks, as, art, was, produced, on, some, of, the, aegean, islands, in, crete, and, in, the, wealthy, greek, colonies, of, southern, italy, and, sicily, by, the, later, archaic, and, early, classical, period, however, the, two, great, commercial, powers, corinth, and, athens, came, to, dominate, their, pottery, was, exported, all, over, the, greek, world, driving, out, the, local, varieties, pots, from, corinth, and, athens, are, found, as, far, afield, as, spain, and, ukraine, and, are, so, common, in, italy, that, they, were, first, collected, in, the, 18th, century, as, etruscan, vases, many, of, these, pots, are, mass, produced, products, of, low, quality, in, fact, by, the, 5th, century, bc, pottery, had, become, an, industry, and, pottery, painting, ceased, to, be, an, important, art, form, the, range, of, colours, which, could, be, used, on, pots, was, restricted, by, the, technology, of, firing, black, white, red, and, yellow, were, the, most, common, in, the, three, earlier, periods, the, pots, were, left, their, natural, light, colour, and, were, decorated, with, slip, that, turned, black, in, the, kiln, greek, pottery, is, frequently, signed, sometimes, by, the, potter, or, the, master, of, the, pottery, but, only, occasionally, by, the, painter, hundreds, of, painters, are, however, identifiable, by, their, artistic, personalities, where, their, signatures, have, not, survived, they, are, named, for, their, subject, choices, as, the, achilles, painter, by, the, potter, they, worked, for, such, as, the, late, archaic, kleophrades, painter, or, even, by, their, modern, locations, such, as, the, late, archaic, berlin, painter, the, history, of, ancient, greek, pottery, is, divided, stylistically, into, five, periods, during, the, protogeometric, and, geometric, periods, greek, pottery, was, decorated, with, abstract, designs, in, the, former, usually, elegant, and, large, with, plenty, of, unpainted, space, but, in, the, geometric, often, densely, covering, most, of, the, surface, as, in, the, large, pots, by, the, dipylon, master, who, worked, around, 750, he, and, other, potters, around, his, time, began, to, introduce, very, stylised, silhouette, figures, of, humans, and, animals, especially, horses, these, often, represent, funeral, processions, or, battles, presumably, representing, those, fought, by, the, deceased, the, geometric, phase, was, followed, by, an, orientalizing, period, in, the, late, 8th, century, when, a, few, animals, many, either, mythical, or, not, native, to, greece, like, the, sphinx, and, lion, respectively, were, adapted, from, the, near, east, accompanied, by, decorative, motifs, such, as, the, lotus, and, palmette, these, were, shown, much, larger, than, the, previous, figures, the, wild, goat, style, is, a, regional, variant, very, often, showing, goats, human, figures, were, not, so, influenced, from, the, east, but, also, became, larger, and, more, detailed, the, fully, mature, black, figure, technique, with, added, red, and, white, details, and, incising, for, outlines, and, details, originated, in, corinth, during, the, early, 7th, century, bc, and, was, introduced, into, attica, about, a, generation, later, it, flourished, until, the, end, of, the, 6th, century, bc, the, red, figure, technique, invented, in, about, 530, bc, reversed, this, tradition, with, the, pots, being, painted, black, and, the, figures, painted, in, red, red, figure, vases, slowly, replaced, the, black, figure, style, sometimes, larger, vessels, were, engraved, as, well, as, painted, erotic, themes, both, heterosexual, and, male, homosexual, became, common, by, about, 320, bc, fine, figurative, vase, painting, had, ceased, in, athens, and, other, greek, centres, with, the, polychromatic, kerch, style, a, final, flourish, it, was, probably, replaced, by, metalwork, for, most, of, its, functions, west, slope, ware, with, decorative, motifs, on, a, black, glazed, body, continued, for, over, a, century, after, italian, red, figure, painting, ended, by, about, 300, and, in, the, next, century, the, relatively, primitive, hadra, vases, probably, from, crete, centuripe, ware, from, sicily, and, panathenaic, amphorae, now, a, frozen, tradition, were, the, only, large, painted, vases, still, made, fine, metalwork, was, an, important, art, in, ancient, greece, but, later, production, is, very, poorly, represented, by, survivals, most, of, which, come, from, the, edges, of, the, greek, world, or, beyond, from, as, far, as, france, or, russia, vessels, and, jewellery, were, produced, to, high, standards, and, exported, far, afield, objects, in, silver, at, the, time, worth, more, relative, to, gold, than, it, is, in, modern, times, were, often, inscribed, by, the, maker, with, their, weight, as, they, were, treated, largely, as, stores, of, value, and, likely, to, be, sold, or, re, melted, before, very, long, during, the, geometric, and, archaic, phases, the, production, of, large, metal, vessels, was, an, important, expression, of, greek, creativity, and, an, important, stage, in, the, development, of, bronzeworking, techniques, such, as, casting, and, repousse, hammering, early, sanctuaries, especially, olympia, yielded, many, hundreds, of, tripod, bowl, or, sacrificial, tripod, vessels, mostly, in, bronze, deposited, as, votives, these, had, a, shallow, bowl, with, two, handles, raised, high, on, three, legs, in, later, versions, the, stand, and, bowl, were, different, pieces, during, the, orientalising, period, such, tripods, were, frequently, decorated, with, figural, protomes, in, the, shape, of, griffins, sphinxes, and, other, fantastic, creatures, swords, the, greek, helmet, and, often, body, armour, such, as, the, muscle, cuirass, were, made, of, bronze, sometimes, decorated, in, precious, metal, as, in, the, 3rd, century, ksour, essef, cuirass, armour, and, shield, bands, are, two, of, the, contexts, for, strips, of, archaic, low, relief, scenes, which, were, also, attached, to, various, objects, in, wood, the, band, on, the, vix, krater, is, a, large, example, polished, bronze, mirrors, initially, with, decorated, backs, and, kore, handles, were, another, common, item, the, later, folding, mirror, type, had, hinged, cover, pieces, often, decorated, with, a, relief, scene, typically, erotic, coins, are, described, below, from, the, late, archaic, the, best, metalworking, kept, pace, with, stylistic, developments, in, sculpture, and, the, other, arts, and, phidias, is, among, the, sculptors, known, to, have, practiced, it, hellenistic, taste, encouraged, highly, intricate, displays, of, technical, virtuousity, tending, to, cleverness, whimsy, or, excessive, elegance, many, or, most, greek, pottery, shapes, were, taken, from, shapes, first, used, in, metal, and, in, recent, decades, there, has, been, an, increasing, view, that, much, of, the, finest, vase, painting, reused, designs, by, silversmiths, for, vessels, with, engraving, and, sections, plated, in, a, different, metal, working, from, drawn, designs, exceptional, survivals, of, what, may, have, been, a, relatively, common, class, of, large, bronze, vessels, are, two, volute, kraters, for, mixing, wine, and, water, these, are, the, vix, krater, c, 530, bc, 1, 63, m, 5, ft, 4, in, high, and, over, 200, kg, 440, lb, in, weight, holding, some, 1, 100, litres, and, found, in, the, burial, of, a, celtic, woman, in, modern, france, and, the, 4th, century, derveni, krater, 90, 5, cm, 35, 6, in, high, the, elites, of, other, neighbours, of, the, greeks, such, as, the, thracians, and, scythians, were, keen, consumers, of, greek, metalwork, and, probably, served, by, greek, goldsmiths, settled, in, their, territories, who, adapted, their, products, to, suit, local, taste, and, functions, such, hybrid, pieces, form, a, large, part, of, survivals, including, the, panagyurishte, treasure, borovo, treasure, and, other, thracian, treasures, and, several, scythian, burials, which, probably, contained, work, by, greek, artists, based, in, the, greek, settlements, on, the, black, sea, as, with, other, luxury, arts, the, macedonian, royal, cemetery, at, vergina, has, produced, objects, of, top, quality, from, the, cusp, of, the, classical, and, hellenistic, periods, jewellery, for, the, greek, market, is, often, of, superb, quality, with, one, unusual, form, being, intricate, and, very, delicate, gold, wreaths, imitating, plant, forms, worn, on, the, head, these, were, probably, rarely, if, ever, worn, in, life, but, were, given, as, votives, and, worn, in, death, many, of, the, fayum, mummy, portraits, wear, them, some, pieces, especially, in, the, hellenistic, period, are, large, enough, to, offer, scope, for, figures, as, did, the, scythian, taste, for, relatively, substantial, pieces, in, gold, the, greeks, decided, very, early, on, that, the, human, form, was, the, most, important, subject, for, artistic, endeavour, seeing, their, gods, as, having, human, form, there, was, little, distinction, between, the, sacred, and, the, secular, in, art, the, human, body, was, both, secular, and, sacred, a, male, nude, of, apollo, or, heracles, had, only, slight, differences, in, treatment, to, one, of, that, year, s, olympic, boxing, champion, in, the, archaic, period, the, most, important, sculptural, form, was, the, kouros, plural, kouroi, the, standing, male, nude, see, for, example, biton, and, kleobis, the, kore, plural, korai, or, standing, clothed, female, figure, was, also, common, but, since, greek, society, did, not, permit, the, public, display, of, female, nudity, until, the, 4th, century, bc, the, kore, is, considered, to, be, of, less, importance, in, the, development, of, sculpture, by, the, end, of, the, period, architectural, sculpture, on, temples, was, becoming, important, as, with, pottery, the, greeks, did, not, produce, monumental, sculpture, merely, for, artistic, display, statues, were, commissioned, either, by, aristocratic, individuals, or, by, the, state, and, used, for, public, memorials, as, offerings, to, temples, oracles, and, sanctuaries, as, is, frequently, shown, by, inscriptions, on, the, statues, or, as, markers, for, graves, statues, in, the, archaic, period, were, not, all, intended, to, represent, specific, individuals, they, were, depictions, of, an, ideal, beauty, piety, honor, or, sacrifice, these, were, always, depictions, of, young, men, ranging, in, age, from, adolescence, to, early, maturity, even, when, placed, on, the, graves, of, presumably, elderly, citizens, kouroi, were, all, stylistically, similar, graduations, in, the, social, stature, of, the, person, commissioning, the, statue, were, indicated, by, size, rather, than, artistic, innovations, unlike, authors, those, who, practiced, the, visual, arts, including, sculpture, initially, had, a, low, social, status, in, ancient, greece, though, increasingly, leading, sculptors, might, become, famous, and, rather, wealthy, and, often, signed, their, work, often, on, the, plinth, which, typically, became, separated, from, the, statue, itself, plutarch, life, of, pericles, ii, said, we, admire, the, work, of, art, but, despise, the, maker, of, it, this, was, a, common, view, in, the, ancient, world, ancient, greek, sculpture, is, categorised, by, the, usual, stylistic, periods, of, archaic, classical, and, hellenistic, augmented, with, some, extra, ones, mainly, applying, to, sculpture, such, as, the, orientalizing, daedalic, style, and, the, severe, style, of, early, classical, sculpture, surviving, ancient, greek, sculptures, were, mostly, made, of, two, types, of, material, stone, especially, marble, or, other, high, quality, limestones, was, used, most, frequently, and, carved, by, hand, with, metal, tools, stone, sculptures, could, be, free, standing, fully, carved, in, the, round, statues, or, only, partially, carved, reliefs, still, attached, to, a, background, plaque, for, example, in, architectural, friezes, or, grave, stelai, bronze, statues, were, of, higher, status, but, have, survived, in, far, smaller, numbers, due, to, the, reusability, of, metals, they, were, usually, made, in, the, lost, wax, technique, chryselephantine, or, gold, and, ivory, statues, were, the, cult, images, in, temples, and, were, regarded, as, the, highest, form, of, sculpture, but, only, some, fragmentary, pieces, have, survived, they, were, normally, over, lifesize, built, around, a, wooden, frame, with, thin, carved, slabs, of, ivory, representing, the, flesh, and, sheets, of, gold, leaf, probably, over, wood, representing, the, garments, armour, hair, and, other, details, in, some, cases, glass, paste, glass, and, precious, and, semi, precious, stones, were, used, for, detail, such, as, eyes, jewellery, and, weaponry, other, large, acrolithic, statues, used, stone, for, the, flesh, parts, and, wood, for, the, rest, and, marble, statues, sometimes, had, stucco, hairstyles, most, sculpture, was, painted, see, below, and, much, wore, real, jewellery, and, had, inlaid, eyes, and, other, elements, in, different, materials, terracotta, was, occasionally, employed, for, large, statuary, few, examples, of, this, survived, at, least, partially, due, to, the, fragility, of, such, statues, the, best, known, exception, to, this, is, a, statue, of, zeus, carrying, ganymede, found, at, olympia, executed, around, 470, bc, in, this, case, the, terracotta, is, painted, there, were, undoubtedly, sculptures, purely, in, wood, which, may, have, been, very, important, in, early, periods, but, effectively, none, have, survived, bronze, age, cycladic, art, to, about, 1100, bc, had, already, shown, an, unusual, focus, on, the, human, figure, usually, shown, in, a, straightforward, frontal, standing, position, with, arms, folded, across, the, stomach, among, the, smaller, features, only, noses, sometimes, eyes, and, female, breasts, were, carved, though, the, figures, were, apparently, usually, painted, and, may, have, originally, looked, very, different, inspired, by, the, monumental, stone, sculpture, of, egypt, and, mesopotamia, during, the, archaic, period, the, greeks, began, again, to, carve, in, stone, greek, mercenaries, and, merchants, were, active, abroad, as, in, egypt, in, the, service, of, pharaoh, psamtik, i, 664, 610, bc, and, were, exposed, to, the, monumental, art, of, these, countries, it, is, generally, agreed, that, egyptian, statuary, of, the, 2nd, millennium, bc, gave, the, decisive, impulse, for, the, innovation, of, greek, sculpture, in, life, size, and, in, hyper, formats, in, the, archaic, period, during, the, late, 7th, century, free, standing, figures, share, the, solidity, and, frontal, stance, characteristic, of, eastern, models, but, their, forms, are, more, dynamic, than, those, of, egyptian, sculpture, as, for, example, the, lady, of, auxerre, and, torso, of, hera, early, archaic, period, c, 660, 580, bc, both, in, the, louvre, paris, after, about, 575, bc, figures, such, as, these, both, male, and, female, wore, the, so, called, archaic, smile, this, expression, which, has, no, specific, appropriateness, to, the, person, or, situation, depicted, may, have, been, a, device, to, give, the, figures, a, distinctive, human, characteristic, three, types, of, figures, were, used, the, standing, nude, youth, kouros, the, standing, draped, girl, kore, and, less, frequently, the, seated, woman, all, emphasize, and, generalize, the, essential, features, of, the, human, figure, and, show, an, increasingly, accurate, comprehension, of, human, anatomy, the, youths, were, either, sepulchral, or, votive, statues, examples, are, apollo, metropolitan, museum, of, art, new, york, an, early, work, the, strangford, apollo, from, anafi, british, museum, london, a, much, later, work, and, the, anavyssos, kouros, national, archaeological, museum, of, athens, more, of, the, musculature, and, skeletal, structure, is, visible, in, this, statue, than, in, earlier, works, the, standing, draped, girls, have, a, wide, range, of, expression, as, in, the, sculptures, in, the, acropolis, museum, of, athens, their, drapery, is, carved, and, painted, with, the, delicacy, and, meticulousness, common, in, the, details, of, sculpture, of, this, period, archaic, reliefs, have, survived, from, many, tombs, and, from, larger, buildings, at, foce, del, sele, now, in, the, national, archaeological, museum, of, paestum, in, italy, with, two, groups, of, metope, panels, from, about, 550, and, 510, and, the, siphnian, treasury, at, delphi, with, friezes, and, a, small, pediment, parts, all, now, in, local, museums, survive, of, the, large, triangular, pediment, groups, from, the, temple, of, artemis, corfu, c, 580, dominated, by, a, huge, gorgon, and, the, old, temple, of, athena, in, athens, c, 530, 500, in, the, classical, period, there, was, a, revolution, in, greek, statuary, usually, associated, with, the, introduction, of, democracy, and, the, end, of, the, aristocratic, culture, associated, with, the, kouroi, the, classical, period, saw, changes, in, the, style, and, function, of, sculpture, poses, became, more, naturalistic, see, the, charioteer, of, delphi, for, an, example, of, the, transition, to, more, naturalistic, sculpture, and, the, technical, skill, of, greek, sculptors, in, depicting, the, human, form, in, a, variety, of, poses, greatly, increased, from, about, 500, bc, statues, began, to, depict, real, people, the, statues, of, harmodius, and, aristogeiton, set, up, in, athens, to, mark, the, overthrow, of, the, tyranny, were, said, to, be, the, first, public, monuments, to, actual, people, at, the, same, time, sculpture, and, statues, were, put, to, wider, uses, the, great, temples, of, the, classical, era, such, as, the, parthenon, in, athens, and, the, temple, of, zeus, at, olympia, required, relief, sculpture, for, decorative, friezes, and, sculpture, in, the, round, to, fill, the, triangular, fields, of, the, pediments, the, difficult, aesthetic, and, technical, challenge, stimulated, much, in, the, way, of, sculptural, innovation, these, works, survive, only, in, fragments, the, most, famous, of, which, are, the, parthenon, marbles, half, of, which, are, in, the, british, museum, funeral, statuary, evolved, during, this, period, from, the, rigid, and, impersonal, kouros, of, the, archaic, period, to, the, highly, personal, family, groups, of, the, classical, period, these, monuments, are, commonly, found, in, the, suburbs, of, athens, which, in, ancient, times, were, cemeteries, on, the, outskirts, of, the, city, although, some, of, them, depict, ideal, types, the, mourning, mother, the, dutiful, son, they, increasingly, depicted, real, people, typically, showing, the, departed, taking, his, dignified, leave, from, his, family, they, are, among, the, most, intimate, and, affecting, remains, of, the, ancient, greeks, in, the, classical, period, for, the, first, time, we, know,

classical, period, mid, 4th, century, his, aphrodite, of, knidos, which, survives, in, copies, was, said, by, pliny, to, be, the, greatest, statue, in, the, world, the, most, famous, works, of, the, classical, period, for, contemporaries, were, the, colossal, statue, of, zeus, at, olympia, and, the, statue, of, athena, parthenos, in, the, parthenon, both, were, chryselephantine, and, executed, by, phidias, or, under, his, direction, and, are, now, lost, although, smaller, copies, in, other, materials, and, good, descriptions, of, both, still, exist, their, size, and, magnificence, prompted, emperors, to, seize, them, in, the, byzantine, period, and, both, were, removed, to, constantinople, where, they, were, later, destroyed, in, fires, the, transition, from, the, classical, to, the, hellenistic, period, occurred, during, the, 4th, century, bc, following, the, conquests, of, alexander, the, great, 336, bc, to, 323, bc, greek, culture, spread, as, far, as, india, as, revealed, by, the, excavations, of, ai, khanoum, in, eastern, afghanistan, and, the, civilization, of, the, greco, bactrians, and, the, indo, greeks, greco, buddhist, art, represented, a, syncretism, between, greek, art, and, the, visual, expression, of, buddhism, thus, greek, art, became, more, diverse, and, more, influenced, by, the, cultures, of, the, peoples, drawn, into, the, greek, orbit, in, the, view, of, some, art, historians, it, also, declined, in, quality, and, originality, this, however, is, a, judgement, which, artists, and, art, lovers, of, the, time, would, not, have, shared, indeed, many, sculptures, previously, considered, as, classical, masterpieces, are, now, recognised, as, being, hellenistic, the, technical, ability, of, hellenistic, sculptors, is, clearly, in, evidence, in, such, major, works, as, the, winged, victory, of, samothrace, and, the, pergamon, altar, new, centres, of, greek, culture, particularly, in, sculpture, developed, in, alexandria, antioch, pergamum, and, other, cities, where, the, new, monarchies, were, lavish, patrons, by, the, 2nd, century, the, rising, power, of, rome, had, also, absorbed, much, of, the, greek, tradition, and, an, increasing, proportion, of, its, products, as, well, during, this, period, sculpture, became, more, naturalistic, and, also, expressive, the, interest, in, depicting, extremes, of, emotion, being, sometimes, pushed, to, extremes, genre, subjects, of, common, people, women, children, animals, and, domestic, scenes, became, acceptable, subjects, for, sculpture, which, was, commissioned, by, wealthy, families, for, the, adornment, of, their, homes, and, gardens, the, boy, with, thorn, is, an, example, realistic, portraits, of, men, and, women, of, all, ages, were, produced, and, sculptors, no, longer, felt, obliged, to, depict, people, as, ideals, of, beauty, or, physical, perfection, the, world, of, dionysus, a, pastoral, idyll, populated, by, satyrs, maenads, nymphs, and, sileni, had, been, often, depicted, in, earlier, vase, painting, and, figurines, but, rarely, in, full, size, sculpture, now, such, works, were, made, surviving, in, copies, including, the, barberini, faun, the, belvedere, torso, and, the, resting, satyr, the, furietti, centaurs, and, sleeping, hermaphroditus, reflect, related, themes, at, the, same, time, the, new, hellenistic, cities, springing, up, all, over, egypt, syria, and, anatolia, required, statues, depicting, the, gods, and, heroes, of, greece, for, their, temples, and, public, places, this, made, sculpture, like, pottery, an, industry, with, the, consequent, standardisation, and, some, lowering, of, quality, for, these, reasons, many, more, hellenistic, statues, have, survived, than, is, the, case, with, the, classical, period, some, of, the, best, known, hellenistic, sculptures, are, the, winged, victory, of, samothrace, 2nd, or, 1st, century, bc, the, statue, of, aphrodite, from, the, island, of, melos, known, as, the, venus, de, milo, mid, 2nd, century, bc, the, dying, gaul, about, 230, bc, and, the, monumental, group, laoco, n, and, his, sons, late, 1st, century, bc, all, these, statues, depict, classical, themes, but, their, treatment, is, far, more, sensuous, and, emotional, than, the, austere, taste, of, the, classical, period, would, have, allowed, or, its, technical, skills, permitted, the, multi, figure, group, of, statues, was, a, hellenistic, innovation, probably, of, the, 3rd, century, taking, the, epic, battles, of, earlier, temple, pediment, reliefs, off, their, walls, and, placing, them, as, life, size, groups, of, statues, their, style, is, often, called, baroque, with, extravagantly, contorted, body, poses, and, intense, expressions, in, the, faces, the, reliefs, on, the, pergamon, altar, are, the, nearest, original, survivals, but, several, well, known, works, are, believed, to, be, roman, copies, of, hellenistic, originals, these, include, the, dying, gaul, and, ludovisi, gaul, as, well, as, a, less, well, known, kneeling, gaul, and, others, all, believed, to, copy, pergamene, commissions, by, attalus, i, to, commemorate, his, victory, around, 241, over, the, gauls, of, galatia, probably, comprising, two, groups, the, laoco, n, group, the, farnese, bull, menelaus, supporting, the, body, of, patroclus, pasquino, group, arrotino, and, the, sperlonga, sculptures, are, other, examples, from, the, 2nd, century, the, neo, attic, or, neo, classical, style, is, seen, by, different, scholars, as, either, a, reaction, to, baroque, excesses, returning, to, a, version, of, classical, style, or, as, a, continuation, of, the, traditional, style, for, cult, statues, workshops, in, the, style, became, mainly, producers, of, copies, for, the, roman, market, which, preferred, copies, of, classical, rather, than, hellenistic, pieces, discoveries, made, since, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, surrounding, the, now, submerged, ancient, egyptian, city, of, heracleum, include, a, 4th, century, bc, unusually, sensual, detailed, and, feministic, as, opposed, to, deified, depiction, of, isis, marking, a, combination, of, egyptian, and, hellenistic, forms, beginning, around, the, time, of, egypt, s, conquest, by, alexander, the, great, however, this, was, untypical, of, ptolemaic, court, sculpture, which, generally, avoided, mixing, egyptian, styles, with, its, fairly, conventional, hellenistic, style, while, temples, in, the, rest, of, the, country, continued, using, late, versions, of, traditional, egyptian, formulae, scholars, have, proposed, an, alexandrian, style, in, hellenistic, sculpture, but, there, is, in, fact, little, to, connect, it, with, alexandria, hellenistic, sculpture, was, also, marked, by, an, increase, in, scale, which, culminated, in, the, colossus, of, rhodes, late, 3rd, century, which, was, the, same, size, as, the, statue, of, liberty, the, combined, effect, of, earthquakes, and, looting, have, destroyed, this, as, well, as, other, very, large, works, of, this, period, clay, is, a, material, frequently, used, for, the, making, of, votive, statuettes, or, idols, even, before, the, minoan, civilization, and, continuing, until, the, roman, period, during, the, 8th, century, bc, tombs, in, boeotia, often, contain, bell, idols, female, statuettes, with, mobile, legs, the, head, small, compared, to, the, remainder, of, the, body, is, perched, at, the, end, of, a, long, neck, while, the, body, is, very, full, in, the, shape, of, a, bell, archaic, heroon, tombs, for, local, heroes, might, receive, large, numbers, of, crudely, shaped, figurines, with, rudimentary, figuration, generally, representing, characters, with, raised, arms, by, the, hellenistic, period, most, terracotta, figurines, have, lost, their, religious, nature, and, represent, characters, from, everyday, life, tanagra, figurines, from, one, of, several, centres, of, production, are, mass, manufactured, using, moulds, and, then, painted, after, firing, dolls, figures, of, fashionably, dressed, ladies, and, of, actors, some, of, these, probably, portraits, were, among, the, new, subjects, depicted, with, a, refined, style, these, were, cheap, and, initially, displayed, in, the, home, much, like, modern, ornamental, figurines, but, were, quite, often, buried, with, their, owners, at, the, same, time, cities, like, alexandria, smyrna, or, tarsus, produced, an, abundance, of, grotesque, figurines, representing, individuals, with, deformed, members, eyes, bulging, and, contorting, themselves, such, figurines, were, also, made, from, bronze, for, painted, architectural, terracottas, see, architecture, below, figurines, made, of, metal, primarily, bronze, are, an, extremely, common, find, at, early, greek, sanctuaries, like, olympia, where, thousands, of, such, objects, mostly, depicting, animals, have, been, found, they, are, usually, produced, in, the, lost, wax, technique, and, can, be, considered, the, initial, stage, in, the, development, of, greek, bronze, sculpture, the, most, common, motifs, during, the, geometric, period, were, horses, and, deer, but, dogs, cattle, and, other, animals, are, also, depicted, human, figures, occur, occasionally, the, production, of, small, metal, votives, continued, throughout, greek, antiquity, in, the, classical, and, hellenistic, periods, more, elaborate, bronze, statuettes, closely, connected, with, monumental, sculpture, also, became, common, high, quality, examples, were, keenly, collected, by, wealthy, greeks, and, later, romans, but, relatively, few, have, survived, architecture, meaning, buildings, executed, to, an, aesthetically, considered, design, ceased, in, greece, from, the, end, of, the, mycenaean, period, about, 1200, bc, until, the, 7th, century, when, urban, life, and, prosperity, recovered, to, a, point, where, public, building, could, be, undertaken, since, most, greek, buildings, in, the, archaic, and, early, classical, periods, were, made, of, wood, or, mudbrick, nothing, remains, of, them, except, a, few, ground, plans, and, there, are, almost, no, written, sources, on, early, architecture, or, descriptions, of, buildings, most, of, our, knowledge, of, greek, architecture, comes, from, the, surviving, buildings, of, the, late, archaic, classical, hellenistic, and, roman, periods, since, ancient, roman, architecture, heavily, used, greek, styles, and, from, late, written, sources, such, as, vitruvius, 1st, century, bc, this, means, that, there, is, a, strong, bias, towards, temples, the, most, common, major, buildings, to, survive, here, the, squared, blocks, of, stone, used, for, walls, were, useful, for, later, buildings, and, so, often, all, that, survives, are, parts, of, columns, and, metopes, that, were, harder, to, recycle, for, most, of, the, period, a, strict, stone, post, and, lintel, system, of, construction, was, used, held, in, place, only, by, gravity, corbelling, was, known, in, mycenean, greece, and, the, arch, was, known, from, the, 5th, century, at, the, latest, but, hardly, any, use, was, made, of, these, techniques, until, the, roman, period, wood, was, only, used, for, ceilings, and, roof, timbers, in, prestigious, stone, buildings, the, use, of, large, terracotta, roof, tiles, only, held, in, place, by, grooving, meant, that, roofs, needed, to, have, a, low, pitch, until, hellenistic, times, only, public, buildings, were, built, using, the, formal, stone, style, these, included, above, all, temples, and, the, smaller, treasury, buildings, which, often, accompanied, them, and, were, built, at, delphi, by, many, cities, other, building, types, often, not, roofed, were, the, central, agora, often, with, one, or, more, colonnaded, stoa, around, it, theatres, the, gymnasium, and, palaestra, or, wrestling, school, the, ekklesiasterion, or, bouleuterion, for, assemblies, and, the, propylaea, or, monumental, gateways, round, buildings, for, various, functions, were, called, a, tholos, and, the, largest, stone, structures, were, often, defensive, city, walls, tombs, were, for, most, of, the, period, only, made, as, elaborate, mausolea, around, the, edges, of, the, greek, world, especially, in, anatolia, private, houses, were, built, around, a, courtyard, where, funds, allowed, and, showed, blank, walls, to, the, street, they, sometimes, had, a, second, story, but, very, rarely, basements, they, were, usually, built, of, rubble, at, best, and, relatively, little, is, known, about, them, at, least, for, males, much, of, life, was, spent, outside, them, a, few, palaces, from, the, hellenistic, period, have, been, excavated, temples, and, some, other, buildings, such, as, the, treasuries, at, delphi, were, planned, as, either, a, cube, or, more, often, a, rectangle, made, from, limestone, of, which, greece, has, an, abundance, and, which, was, cut, into, large, blocks, and, dressed, this, was, supplemented, by, columns, at, least, on, the, entrance, front, and, often, on, all, sides, other, buildings, were, more, flexible, in, plan, and, even, the, wealthiest, houses, seem, to, have, lacked, much, external, ornament, marble, was, an, expensive, building, material, in, greece, high, quality, marble, came, only, from, mt, pentelus, in, attica, and, from, a, few, islands, such, as, paros, and, its, transportation, in, large, blocks, was, difficult, it, was, used, mainly, for, sculptural, decoration, not, structurally, except, in, the, very, grandest, buildings, of, the, classical, period, such, as, the, parthenon, in, athens, there, were, two, main, classical, orders, of, greek, architecture, the, doric, and, the, ionic, with, the, corinthian, order, only, appearing, in, the, classical, period, and, not, becoming, dominant, until, the, roman, period, the, most, obvious, features, of, the, three, orders, are, the, capitals, of, the, columns, but, there, are, significant, differences, in, other, points, of, design, and, decoration, between, the, orders, these, names, were, used, by, the, greeks, themselves, and, reflected, their, belief, that, the, styles, descended, from, the, dorian, and, ionian, greeks, of, the, dark, ages, but, this, is, unlikely, to, be, true, the, doric, was, the, earliest, probably, first, appearing, in, stone, in, the, earlier, 7th, century, having, developed, though, perhaps, not, very, directly, from, predecessors, in, wood, it, was, used, in, mainland, greece, and, the, greek, colonies, in, italy, the, ionic, style, was, first, used, in, the, cities, of, ionia, now, the, west, coast, of, turkey, and, some, of, the, aegean, islands, probably, beginning, in, the, 6th, century, the, doric, style, was, more, formal, and, austere, the, ionic, more, relaxed, and, decorative, the, more, ornate, corinthian, order, was, a, later, development, of, the, ionic, initially, apparently, only, used, inside, buildings, and, using, ionic, forms, for, everything, except, the, capitals, the, famous, and, well, preserved, choragic, monument, of, lysicrates, near, the, acropolis, of, athens, 335, 334, is, the, first, known, use, of, the, corinthian, order, on, the, exterior, of, a, building, most, of, the, best, known, surviving, greek, buildings, such, as, the, parthenon, and, the, temple, of, hephaestus, in, athens, are, doric, the, erechtheum, next, to, the, parthenon, however, is, ionic, the, ionic, order, became, dominant, in, the, hellenistic, period, since, its, more, decorative, style, suited, the, aesthetic, of, the, period, better, than, the, more, restrained, doric, some, of, the, best, surviving, hellenistic, buildings, such, as, the, library, of, celsus, can, be, seen, in, turkey, at, cities, such, as, ephesus, and, pergamum, but, in, the, greatest, of, hellenistic, cities, alexandria, in, egypt, almost, nothing, survives, coins, were, probably, invented, in, lydia, in, the, 7th, century, bc, but, they, were, first, extensively, used, by, the, greeks, and, the, greeks, set, the, canon, of, coin, design, which, has, been, followed, ever, since, coin, design, today, still, recognisably, follows, patterns, descended, from, ancient, greece, the, greeks, did, not, see, coin, design, as, a, major, art, form, although, some, were, expensively, designed, by, leading, goldsmiths, especially, outside, greece, itself, among, the, central, asian, kingdoms, and, in, sicilian, cities, keen, to, promote, themselves, nevertheless, the, durability, and, abundance, of, coins, have, made, them, one, of, the, most, important, sources, of, knowledge, about, greek, aesthetics, greek, coins, are, the, only, art, form, from, the, ancient, greek, world, which, can, still, be, bought, and, owned, by, private, collectors, of, modest, means, the, most, widespread, coins, used, far, beyond, their, native, territories, and, copied, and, forged, by, others, were, the, athenian, tetradrachm, issued, from, c, 510, to, c, 38, bc, and, in, the, hellenistic, age, the, macedonian, tetradrachm, both, silver, these, both, kept, the, same, familiar, design, for, long, periods, greek, designers, began, the, practice, of, putting, a, profile, portrait, on, the, obverse, of, coins, this, was, initially, a, symbolic, portrait, of, the, patron, god, or, goddess, of, the, city, issuing, the, coin, athena, for, athens, apollo, at, corinth, demeter, at, thebes, and, so, on, later, heads, of, heroes, of, greek, mythology, were, used, such, as, heracles, on, the, coins, of, alexander, the, great, the, first, human, portraits, on, coins, were, those, of, achaemenid, empire, satraps, in, asia, minor, starting, with, the, exiled, athenian, general, themistocles, who, became, a, satrap, of, magnesia, c, 450, bc, and, continuing, especially, with, the, dynasts, of, lycia, towards, the, end, of, the, 5th, century, greek, cities, in, italy, such, as, syracuse, began, to, put, the, heads, of, real, people, on, coins, in, the, 4th, century, bc, as, did, the, hellenistic, successors, of, alexander, the, great, in, egypt, syria, and, elsewhere, on, the, reverse, of, their, coins, the, greek, cities, often, put, a, symbol, of, the, city, an, owl, for, athens, a, dolphin, for, syracuse, and, so, on, the, placing, of, inscriptions, on, coins, also, began, in, greek, times, all, these, customs, were, later, continued, by, the, romans, the, most, artistically, ambitious, coins, designed, by, goldsmiths, or, gem, engravers, were, often, from, the, edges, of, the, greek, world, from, new, colonies, in, the, early, period, and, new, kingdoms, later, as, a, form, of, marketing, their, brands, in, modern, terms, of, the, larger, cities, corinth, and, syracuse, also, issued, consistently, attractive, coins, some, of, the, greco, bactrian, coins, are, considered, the, finest, examples, of, greek, coins, with, large, portraits, with, a, nice, blend, of, realism, and, idealization, including, the, largest, coins, to, be, minted, in, the, hellenistic, world, the, largest, gold, coin, was, minted, by, eucratides, reigned, 171, 145, bc, the, largest, silver, coin, by, the, indo, greek, king, amyntas, nikator, reigned, c, 95, 90, bc, the, portraits, show, a, degree, of, individuality, never, matched, by, the, often, bland, depictions, of, their, royal, contemporaries, further, west, the, greeks, seem, to, have, valued, painting, above, even, sculpture, and, by, the, hellenistic, period, the, informed, appreciation, and, even, the, practice, of, painting, were, components, in, a, gentlemanly, education, the, ekphrasis, was, a, literary, form, consisting, of, a, description, of, a, work, of, art, and, we, have, a, considerable, body, of, literature, on, greek, painting, and, painters, with, further, additions, in, latin, though, none, of, the, treatises, by, artists, that, are, mentioned, have, survived, we, have, hardly, any, of, the, most, prestigious, sort, of, paintings, on, wood, panel, or, in, fresco, that, this, literature, was, concerned, with, and, very, few, of, the, copies, that, undoubtedly, existed, equivalent, to, those, which, give, us, most, of, our, knowledge, of, greek, sculpture, the, contrast, with, vase, painting, is, total, there, are, no, mentions, of, that, in, literature, at, all, but, over, 100, 000, surviving, examples, giving, many, individual, painters, a, respectable, surviving, oeuvre, our, idea, of, what, the, best, greek, painting, was, like, must, be, drawn, from, a, careful, consideration, of, parallels, in, vase, painting, late, greco, roman, copies, in, mosaic, and, fresco, some, very, late, examples, of, actual, painting, in, the, greek, tradition, and, the, ancient, literature, there, were, several, interconnected, traditions, of, painting, in, ancient, greece, due, to, their, technical, differences, they, underwent, somewhat, differentiated, developments, early, painting, seems, to, have, developed, along, similar, lines, to, vase, painting, heavily, reliant, on, outline, and, flat, areas, of, colour, but, then, flowered, and, developed, at, the, time, that, vase, painting, went, into, decline, by, the, end, of, the, hellenistic, period, technical, developments, included, modelling, to, indicate, contours, in, forms, shadows, foreshortening, some, probably, imprecise, form, of, perspective, interior, and, landscape, backgrounds, and, the, use, of, changing, colours, to, suggest, distance, in, landscapes, so, that, greek, artists, had, all, the, technical, devices, needed, for, fully, illusionistic, painting, the, most, common, and, respected, form, of, art, according, to, authors, like, pliny, or, pausanias, were, panel, paintings, individual, portable, paintings, on, wood, boards, the, techniques, used, were, encaustic, wax, painting, and, tempera, such, paintings, normally, depicted, figural, scenes, including, portraits, and, still, lifes, we, have, descriptions, of, many, compositions, they, were, collected, and, often, displayed, in, public, spaces, pausanias, describes, such, exhibitions, at, athens, and, delphi, we, know, the, names, of, many, famous, painters, mainly, of, the, classical, and, hellenistic, periods, from, literature, see, expandable, list, to, the, right, the, most, famous, of, all, ancient, greek, painters, was, apelles, of, kos, whom, pliny, the, elder, lauded, as, having, surpassed, all, the, other, painters, who, either, preceded, or, succeeded, him, due, to, the, perishable, nature, of, the, materials, used, and, the, major, upheavals, at, the, end, of, antiquity, not, one, of, the, famous, works, of, greek, panel, painting, has, survived, we, have, slightly, more, significant, survivals, of, mural, compositions, the, most, important, surviving, greek, examples, from, before, the, roman, period, are, the, fairly, low, quality, pitsa, panels, from, c, 530, bc, the, tomb, of, the, diver, from, paestum, and, various, paintings, from, the, royal, tombs, at, vergina, more, numerous, paintings, in, etruscan, and, campanian, tombs, are, based, on, greek, styles, in, the, roman, period, there, are, a, number, of, wall, paintings, in, pompeii, and, the, surrounding, area, as, well, as, in, rome, itself, some, of, which, are, thought, to, be, copies, of, specific, earlier, masterpieces, in, particular, copies, of, specific, wall, paintings, have, been, confidently, identified, in, the, alexander, mosaic, and, villa, boscoreale, there, is, a, large, group, of, much, later, greco, roman, archaeological, survivals, from, the, dry, conditions, of, egypt, the, fayum, mummy, portraits, together, with, the, similar, severan, tondo, and, a, small, group, of, painted, portrait, miniatures, in, gold, glass, byzantine, icons, are, also, derived, from, the, encaustic, panel, painting, tradition, and, byzantine, illuminated, manuscripts, sometimes, continued, a, greek, illusionistic, style, for, centuries, the, tradition, of, wall, painting, in, greece, goes, back, at, least, to, the, minoan, and, mycenaean, bronze, age, with, the, lavish, fresco, decoration, of, sites, like, knossos, tiryns, and, mycenae, it, is, not, clear, whether, there, is, any, continuity, between, these, antecedents, and, later, greek, wall, paintings, wall, paintings, are, frequently, described, in, pausanias, and, many, appear, to, have, been, produced, in, the, classical, and, hellenistic, periods, due, to, the, lack, of, architecture, surviving, intact, not, many, are, preserved, the, most, notable, examples, are, a, monumental, archaic, 7th, century, bc, scene, of, hoplite, combat, from, inside, a, temple, at, kalapodi, near, thebes, and, the, elaborate, frescoes, from, the, 4th, century, grave, of, phillipp, and, the, tomb, of, persephone, at, vergina, in, macedonia, or, the, tomb, at, agios, athanasios, thessaloniki, which, are, sometimes, suggested, to, be, closely, linked, to, the, high, quality, panel, paintings, mentioned, above, the, unusual, survival, of, the, tomb, of, the, palmettes, 3rd, century, bc, excavated, in, 1971, with, painting, in, good, condition, includes, portraits, of, the, couple, buried, inside, on, the, tympanum, greek, wall, painting, tradition, is, also, reflected, in, contemporary, grave, decorations, in, the, greek, colonies, in, italy, e, g, the, famous, tomb, of, the, diver, at, paestum, scholars, believe, that, the, celebrated, roman, frescoes, at, sites, like, pompeii, are, descendants, of, the, greek, tradition, and, some, copy, particular, famous, panel, paintings, these, roman, copies, are, all, loose, adaptations, however, with, extra, figures, added, poses, altered, and, colouring, changed, much, of, the, figural, or, architectural, sculpture, of, ancient, greece, was, painted, colourfully, this, aspect, of, greek, stonework, is, described, as, polychrome, from, greek, many, and, colour, due, to, intensive, weathering, polychromy, on, sculpture, and, architecture, has, substantially, or, totally, faded, in, most, cases, although, the, word, polychrome, is, created, from, the, combining, of, two, greek, words, it, was, not, used, in, ancient, greece, the, term, was, coined, in, the, early, nineteenth, century, by, antoine, chrysost, me, quatrem, re, de, quincy, painting, was, also, used, to, enhance, the, visual, aspects, of, architecture, certain, parts, of, the, superstructure, of, greek, temples, were, habitually, painted, since, the, archaic, period, such, architectural, polychromy, could, take, the, form, of, bright, colours, directly, applied, to, the, stone, evidenced, e, g, on, the, parthenon, or, of, elaborate, patterns, frequently, architectural, members, made, of, terracotta, archaic, examples, at, olympia, and, delphi, sometimes, the, terracottas, also, depicted, figural, scenes, as, do, the, 7th, century, bc, terracotta, metopes, from, thermon, most, greek, sculptures, were, painted, in, strong, and, bright, colors, this, is, called, polychromy, the, paint, was, frequently, limited, to, parts, depicting, clothing, hair, and, so, on, with, the, skin, left, in, the, natural, color, of, the, stone, or, bronze, but, it, could, also, cover, sculptures, in, their, totality, female, skin, in, marble, tended, to, be, uncoloured, while, male, skin, might, be, a, light, brown, the, painting, of, greek, sculpture, should, not, merely, be, seen, as, an, enhancement, of, their, sculpted, form, but, has, the, characteristics, of, a, distinct, style, of, art, for, example, the, pedimental, sculptures, from, the, temple, of, aphaia, on, aegina, have, recently, been, demonstrated, to, have, been, painted, with, bold, and, elaborate, patterns, depicting, amongst, other, details, patterned, clothing, the, polychromy, of, stone, statues, was, paralleled, by, the, use, of, different, materials, to, distinguish, skin, clothing, and, other, details, in, chryselephantine, sculptures, and, by, the, use, of, different, metals, to, depict, lips, fingernails, etc, on, high, quality, bronzes, like, the, riace, bronzes, the, most, copious, evidence, of, ancient, greek, painting, survives, in, the, form, of, vase, paintings, these, are, described, in, the, pottery, section, above, they, give, at, least, some, sense, of, the, aesthetics, of, greek, painting, the, techniques, involved, however, were, very, different, from, those, used, in, large, format, painting, the, same, probably, applies, to, the, subject, matter, depicted, vase, painters, appear, to, have, usually, been, specialists, within, a, pottery, workshop, neither, painters, in, other, media, nor, potters, it, should, also, be, kept, in, mind, that, vase, painting, albeit, by, far, the, most, conspicuous, surviving, source, on, ancient, greek, painting, was, not, held, in, the, highest, regard, in, antiquity, and, is, never, mentioned, in, classical, literature, mosaics, were, initially, made, with, rounded, pebbles, and, later, glass, with, tesserae, which, gave, more, colour, and, a, flat, surface, they, were, popular, in, the, hellenistic, period, at, first, as, decoration, for, the, floors, of, palaces, but, eventually, for, private, homes, often, a, central, emblema, picture, in, a, central, panel, was, completed, in, much, finer, work, than, the, surrounding, decoration, xenia, motifs, where, a, house, showed, examples, of, the, variety, of, foods, guests, might, expect, to, enjoy, provide, most, of, the, surviving, specimens, of, greek, still, life, in, general, mosaic, must, be, considered, as, a, secondary, medium, copying, painting, often, very, directly, as, in, the, alexander, mosaic, the, unswept, floor, by, sosus, of, pergamon, c, 200, bc, was, an, original, and, famous, trompe, l, il, piece, known, from, many, greco, roman, copies, according, to, john, boardman, sosus, is, the, only, mosaic, artist, whose, name, has, survived, his, doves, are, also, mentioned, in, literature, and, copied, however, katherine, m, d, dunbabin, asserts, that, two, different, mosaic, artists, left, their, signatures, on, mosaics, of, delos, the, artist, of, the, 4th, century, bc, stag, hunt, mosaic, perhaps, also, left, his, signature, as, gnosis, although, this, word, may, be, a, reference, to, the, abstract, concept, of, knowledge, mosaics, are, a, significant, element, of, surviving, macedonian, art, with, a, large, number, of, examples, preserved, in, the, ruins, of, pella, the, ancient, macedonian, capital, in, today, s, central, macedonia, mosaics, such, as, the, stag, hunt, mosaic, and, lion, hunt, mosaic, demonstrate, illusionist, and, three, dimensional, qualities, generally, found, in, hellenistic, paintings, although, the, rustic, macedonian, pursuit, of, hunting, is, markedly, more, pronounced, than, other, themes, the, 2nd, century, bc, mosaics, of, delos, greece, were, judged, by, fran, ois, chamoux, as, representing, the, pinnacle, of, hellenistic, mosaic, art, with, similar, styles, that, continued, throughout, the, roman, period, and, perhaps, laid, the, foundations, for, the, widespread, use, of, mosaics, in, the, western, world, through, to, the, middle, ages, the, engraved, gem, was, a, luxury, art, with, high, prestige, pompey, and, julius, caesar, were, among, later, collectors, the, technique, has, an, ancient, tradition, in, the, near, east, and, cylinder, seals, whose, design, only, appears, when, rolled, over, damp, clay, from, which, the, flat, ring, type, developed, spread, to, the, minoan, world, including, parts, of, greece, and, cyprus, the, greek, tradition, emerged, under, minoan, influence, on, mainland, helladic, culture, and, reached, an, apogee, of, subtlety, and, refinement, in, the, hellenistic, period, round, or, oval, greek, gems, along, with, similar, objects, in, bone, and, ivory, are, found, from, the, 8th, and, 7th, centuries, bc, usually, with, animals, in, energetic, geometric, poses, often, with, a, border, marked, by, dots, or, a, rim, early, examples, are, mostly, in, softer, stones, gems, of, the, 6th, century, are, more, often, oval, with, a, scarab, back, in, the, past, this, type, was, called, a, scarabaeus, and, human, or, divine, figures, as, well, as, animals, the, scarab, form, was, apparently, adopted, from, phoenicia, the, forms, are, sophisticated, for, the, period, despite, the, usually, small, size, of, the, gems, in, the, 5th, century, gems, became, somewhat, larger, but, still, only, 2, 3, centimetres, tall, despite, this, very, fine, detail, is, shown, including, the, eyelashes, on, one, male, head, perhaps, a, portrait, four, gems, signed, by, dexamenos, of, chios, are, the, finest, of, the, period, two, showing, herons, relief, carving, became, common, in, 5th, century, bc, greece, and, gradually, most, of, the, spectacular, carved, gems, were, in, relief, generally, a, relief, image, is, more, impressive, than, an, intaglio, one, in, the, earlier, form, the, recipient, of, a, document, saw, this, in, the, impressed, sealing, wax, while, in, the, later, reliefs, it, was, the, owner, of, the, seal, who, kept, it, for, himself, probably, marking, the, emergence, of, gems, meant, to, be, collected, or, worn, as, jewellery, pendants, in, necklaces, and, the, like, rather, than, used, as, seals, later, ones, are, sometimes, rather, large, to, use, to, seal, letters, however, inscriptions, are, usually, still, in, reverse, mirror, writing, so, they, only, read, correctly, on, impressions, or, by, viewing, from, behind, with, transparent, stones, this, aspect, also, partly, explains, the, collecting, of, impressions, in, plaster, or, wax, from, gems, which, may, be, easier, to, appreciate, than, the, original, larger, hardstone, carvings, and, cameos, which, are, rare, in, intaglio, form, seem, to, have, reached, greece, around, the, 3rd, century, the, farnese, tazza, is, the, only, major, surviving, hellenistic, example, depending, on, the, dates, assigned, to, the, gonzaga, cameo, and, the, cup, of, the, ptolemies, but, other, glass, paste, imitations, with, portraits, suggest, that, gem, type, cameos, were, made, in, this, period, the, conquests, of, alexander, had, opened, up, new, trade, routes, to, the, greek, world, and, increased, the, range, of, gemstones, available, the, synthesis, in, the, archaic, period, of, the, native, repertoire, of, simple, geometric, motifs, with, imported, mostly, plant, based, motifs, from, further, east, created, a, sizeable, vocabulary, of, ornament, which, artists, and, craftsmen, used, with, confidence, and, fluency, today, this, vocabulary, is, seen, above, all, in, the, large, corpus, of, painted, pottery, as, well, as, in, architectural, remains, but, it, would, have, originally, been, used, in, a, wide, range, of, media, as, a, later, version, of, it, is, used, in, european, neoclassicism, elements, in, this, vocabulary, include, the, geometrical, meander, or, greek, key, egg, and, dart, bead, and, reel, vitruvian, scroll, guilloche, and, from, the, plant, world, the, stylized, acanthus, leaves, volute, palmette, and, half, palmette, plant, scrolls, of, various, kinds, rosette, lotus, flower, and, papyrus, flower, originally, used, prominently, on, archaic, vases, as, figurative, painting, developed, these, were, usually, relegated, to, serve, as, borders, demarcating, edges, of, the, vase, or, different, zones, of, decoration, greek, architecture, was, notable, for, developing, sophisticated, conventions, for, using, mouldings, and, other, architectural, ornamental, elements, which, used, these, motifs, in, a, harmoniously, integrated, whole, even, before, the, classical, period, this, vocabulary, had, influenced, celtic, art, and, the, expansion, of, the, greek, world, after, alexander, and, the, export, of, greek, objects, still, further, afield, exposed, much, of, eurasia, to, it, including, the, regions, in, the, north, of, the, indian, subcontinent, where, buddhism, was, expanding, and, creating, greco, buddhist, art, as, buddhism, spread, across, central, asia, to, china, and, the, rest, of, east, asia, in, a, form, that, made, great, use, of, religious, art, versions, of, this, vocabulary, were, taken, with, it, and, used, to, surround, images, of, buddhas, and, other, religious, images, often, with, a, size, and, emphasis, that, would, have, seemed, excessive, to, the, ancient, greeks, the, vocabulary, was, absorbed, into, the, ornament, of, india, china, persia, and, other, asian, countries, as, well, as, developing, further, in, byzantine, art, the, romans, took, over, the, vocabulary, more, or, less, in, its, entirety, and, although, much, altered, it, can, be, traced, throughout, european, medieval, art, especially, in, plant, based, ornament, islamic, art, where, ornament, largely, replaces, figuration, developed, the, byzantine, plant, scroll, into, the, full, endless, arabesque, and, especially, from, the, mongol, conquests, of, the, 14th, century, received, new, influences, from, china, including, the, descendants, of, the, greek, vocabulary, from, the, renaissance, onwards, several, of, these, asian, styles, were, represented, on, textiles, porcelain, and, other, goods, imported, into, europe, and, influenced, ornament, there, a, process, that, still, continues, although, glass, was, made, in, cyprus, by, the, 9th, century, bc, and, was, considerably, developed, by, the, end, of, the, period, there, are, only, a, few, survivals, of, glasswork, from, before, the, greco, roman, period, that, show, the, artistic, quality, of, the, best, work, most, survivals, are, small, perfume, bottles, in, fancy, coloured, feathered, styles, similar, to, other, mediterranean, glass, hellenistic, glass, became, cheaper, and, accessible, to, a, wider, population, no, greek, furniture, has, survived, but, there, are, many, images, of, it, on, vases, and, memorial, reliefs, for, example, that, to, hegeso, it, was, evidently, often, very, elegant, as, were, the, styles, derived, from, it, from, the, 18th, century, onwards, some, pieces, of, carved, ivory, that, were, used, as, inlays, have, survived, as, at, vergina, and, a, few, ivory, carvings, this, was, a, luxury, art, that, could, be, of, very, fine, quality, it, is, clear, from, vase, paintings, that, the, greeks, often, wore, elaborately, patterned, clothes, and, skill, at, weaving, was, the, mark, of, the, respectable, woman, two, luxurious, pieces, of, cloth, survive, from, the, tomb, of, philip, of, macedon, there, are, numerous, references, to, decorative, hangings, for, both, homes, and, temples, but, none, of, these, have, survived, ancient, greek, art, has, exercised, considerable, influence, on, the, culture, of, many, countries, all, over, the, world, above, all, in, its, treatment, of, the, human, figure, in, the, west, greek, architecture, was, also, hugely, influential, and, in, both, east, and, west, the, influence, of, greek, decoration, can, be, traced, to, the, modern, day, etruscan, and, roman, art, were, largely, and, directly, derived, from, greek, models, and, greek, objects, and, influence, reached, into, celtic, art, north, of, the, alps, as, well, as, all, around, the, mediterranean, world, and, into, persia, in, the, east, alexander, the, great, s, conquests, initiated, several, centuries, of, exchange, between, greek, central, asian, and, indian, cultures, which, was, greatly, aided, by, the, spread, of, buddhism, which, early, on, picked, up, many, greek, traits, and, motifs, in, greco, buddhist, art, which, were, then, transmitted, as, part, of, a, cultural, package, to, east, asia, even, as, far, as, japan, among, artists, who, were, no, doubt, completely, unaware, of, the, origin, of, the, motifs, and, styles, they, used, following, the, renaissance, in, europe, the, humanist, aesthetic, and, the, high, technical, standards, of, greek, art, inspired, generations, of, european, artists, with, a, major, revival, in, the, movement, of, neoclassicism, which, began, in, the, mid, 18th, century, coinciding, with, easier, access, from, western, europe, to, greece, itself, and, a, renewed, importation, of, greek, originals, most, notoriously, the, elgin, marbles, from, the, parthenon, well, into, the, 19th, century, the, classical, tradition, derived, from, greece, dominated, the, art, of, the, western, world, the, hellenized, roman, upper, classes, of, the, late, republic, and, early, empire, generally, accepted, greek, superiority, in, the, arts, without, many, quibbles, though, the, praise, of, pliny, for, the, sculpture, and, painting, of, pre, hellenistic, artists, may, be, based, on, earlier, greek, writings, rather, than, much, personal, knowledge, pliny, and, other, classical, authors, were, known, in, the, renaissance, and, this, assumption, of, greek, superiority, was, again, generally, accepted, however, critics, in, the, renaissance, and, much, later, were, unclear, which, works, were, actually, greek, as, a, part, of, the, ottoman, empire, greece, itself, could, only, be, reached, by, a, very, few, western, europeans, until, the, mid, 18th, century, not, only, the, greek, vases, found, in, the, etruscan, cemeteries, but, also, more, controversially, the, greek, temples, of, paestum, were, taken, to, be, etruscan, or, otherwise, italic, until, the, late, 18th, century, and, beyond, a, misconception, prolonged, by, italian, nationalist, sentiment, the, writings, of, johann, joachim, winckelmann, especially, his, books, thoughts, on, the, imitation, of, greek, works, in, painting, and, sculpture, 1750, and, geschichte, der, kunst, des, alterthums, history, of, ancient, art, 1764, were, the, first, to, distinguish, sharply, between, ancient, greek, etruscan, and, roman, art, and, define, periods, within, greek, art, tracing, a, trajectory, from, growth, to, maturity, and, then, imitation, or, decadence, that, continues, to, have, influence, to, the, present, day, the, full, disentangling, of, greek, statues, from, their, later, roman, copies, and, a, better, understanding, of, the, balance, between, greekness, and, roman, ness, in, greco, roman, art, was, to, take, much, longer, and, perhaps, still, continues, greek, art, especially, sculpture, continued, to, enjoy, an, enormous, reputation, and, studying, and, copying, it, was, a, large, part, of, the, training, of, artists, until, the, downfall, of, academic, art, in, the, late, 19th, century, during, this, period, the, actual, known, corpus, of, greek, art, and, to, a, lesser, extent, architecture, has, greatly, expanded, the, study, of, vases, developed, an, enormous, literature, in, the, late, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, much, based, on, the, identification, of, the, hands, of, individual, artists, with, sir, john, beazley, the, leading, figure, this, literature, generally, assumed, that, vase, painting, represented, the, development, of, an, independent, medium, only, in, general, terms, drawing, from, stylistic, development, in, other, artistic, media, this, assumption, has, been, increasingly, challenged, in, recent, decades, and, some, scholars, now, see, it, as, a, secondary, medium, largely, representing, cheap, copies, of, now, lost, metalwork, and, much, of, it, made, not, for, ordinary, use, but, to, deposit, in, burials,
