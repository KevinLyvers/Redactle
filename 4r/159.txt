then, awards, to, regan, her, share, as, soon, as, she, has, spoken, when, it, is, finally, the, turn, of, his, youngest, and, favourite, daughter, cordelia, at, first, she, refuses, to, say,

speak, privately, revealing, that, their, declarations, of, love, were, false, and, that, they, view, lear, as, a, foolish, old, man, gloucester, s, son, edmund, resents, his, illegitimate, status, and, plots, to, dispose, of, his, legitimate, older, half, brother, edgar, he, tricks, his, father, with, a, forged, letter, making, him, think, that, edgar, plans, to, usurp, the, estate, the, earl, of, kent, returns, from, exile, in, disguise, calling, himself, caius, and, lear, hires, him, as, a, servant, at, albany, and, goneril, s, house, lear, and, kent, quarrel, with, oswald, goneril, s, steward, lear, discovers, that, now, that, goneril, has, power, she, no, longer, respects, him, she, orders, him, to, reduce, the, number, of, his, disorderly, retinue, enraged, lear, departs, for, regan, s, home, the, fool, reproaches, lear, with, his, foolishness, in, giving, everything, to, regan, and, goneril, and, predicts, that, regan, will, treat, him, no, better, edmund, learns, from, curan, a, courtier, that, there, is, likely, to, be, war, between, albany, and, cornwall, and, that, regan, and, cornwall, are, to, arrive, at, gloucester, s, house, that, evening, taking, advantage, of, the, arrival, of, the, duke, and, regan, edmund, fakes, an, attack, by, edgar, and, gloucester, is, completely, taken, in, he, disinherits, edgar, and, proclaims, him, an, outlaw, bearing, lear, s, message, to, regan, kent, meets, oswald, again, at, gloucester, s, home, quarrels, with, him, again, and, is, put, in, the, stocks, by, regan, and, her, husband, cornwall, when, lear, arrives, he, objects, to, the, mistreatment, of, his, messenger, but, regan, is, as, dismissive, of, her, father, as, goneril, was, lear, is, enraged, but, impotent, goneril, arrives, and, supports, regan, s, argument, against, him, lear, yields, completely, to, his, rage, he, rushes, out, into, a, storm, to, rant, against, his, ungrateful, daughters, accompanied, by, the, mocking, fool, kent, later, follows, to, protect, lear, gloucester, protests, against, lear, s, mistreatment, with, lear, s, retinue, of, a, hundred, knights, dissolved, the, only, companions, he, has, left, are, his, fool, and, kent, wandering, on, the, heath, after, the, storm, edgar, in, the, guise, of, a, madman, named, tom, o, bedlam, meets, lear, edgar, babbles, madly, while, lear, denounces, his, daughters, kent, leads, them, all, to, shelter, kent, tells, a, gentleman, that, a, french, army, has, landed, in, britain, aiming, to, reinstate, lear, to, the, throne, he, then, sends, the, gentleman, to, give, cordelia, a, message, while, he, looks, for, king, lear, on, the, heath, meanwhile, edmund, learns, that, gloucester, is, aware, of, france, s, impending, invasion, and, betrays, his, father, to, cornwall, regan, and, goneril, once, edmund, leaves, with, goneril, to, warn, albany, about, the, invasion, gloucester, is, arrested, and, regan, and, cornwall, gouge, out, gloucester, s, eyes, as, they, do, this, a, servant, is, overcome, with, horror, and, comes, to, gloucester, s, defence, mortally, wounding, cornwall, regan, kills, the, servant, and, tells, gloucester, that, edmund, betrayed, him, then, as, she, did, to, her, father, in, act, ii, she, sends, gloucester, out, to, wander, the, heath, edgar, in, his, madman, s, disguise, meets, his, blinded, father, on, the, heath, gloucester, sightless, and, failing, to, recognise, edgar, s, voice, begs, him, to, lead, him, to, a, cliff, at, dover, so, that, he, may, jump, to, his, death, goneril, discovers, that, she, finds, edmund, more, attractive, than, her, honest, husband, albany, whom, she, regards, as, cowardly, albany, has, developed, a, conscience, he, is, disgusted, by, the, sisters, treatment, of, lear, and, gloucester, and, denounces, his, wife, goneril, sends, edmund, back, to, regan, after, receiving, news, of, cornwall, s, death, she, fears, her, newly, widowed, sister, may, steal, edmund, and, sends, him, a, letter, through, oswald, now, alone, with, lear, kent, leads, him, to, the, french, army, which, is, commanded, by, cordelia, but, lear, is, half, mad, and, terribly, embarrassed, by, his, earlier, follies, at, regan, s, instigation, albany, joins, his, forces, with, hers, against, the, french, goneril, s, suspicions, about, regan, s, motives, are, confirmed, and, returned, as, regan, rightly, guesses, the, meaning, of, her, letter, and, declares, to, oswald, that, she, is, a, more, appropriate, match, for, edmund, edgar, pretends, to, lead, gloucester, to, a, cliff, then, changes, his, voice, and, tells, gloucester, he, has, miraculously, survived, a, great, fall, lear, appears, by, now, completely, mad, he, rants, that, the, whole, world, is, corrupt, and, runs, off, oswald, appears, still, looking, for, edmund, on, regan, s, orders, he, tries, to, kill, gloucester, but, is, killed, by, edgar, in, oswald, s, pocket, edgar, finds, goneril, s, letter, in, which, she, encourages, edmund, to, kill, her, husband, and, take, her, as, his, wife, kent, and, cordelia, take, charge, of, lear, whose, madness, quickly, passes, regan, goneril, albany, and, edmund, meet, with, their, forces, albany, insists, that, they, fight, the, french, invaders, but, not, harm, lear, or, cordelia, the, two, sisters, lust, for, edmund, who, has, made, promises, to, both, he, considers, the, dilemma, and, plots, the, deaths, of, albany, lear, and, cordelia, edgar, gives, goneril, s, letter, to, albany, the, armies, meet, in, battle, the, britons, defeat, the, french, and, lear, and, cordelia, are, captured, edmund, sends, lear, and, cordelia, off, with, secret, joint, orders, from, him, representing, regan, and, her, forces, and, goneril, representing, the, forces, of, her, estranged, husband, albany, for, the, execution, of, cordelia, the, victorious, british, leaders, meet, and, the, recently, widowed, regan, now, declares, she, will, marry, edmund, but, albany, exposes, the, intrigues, of, edmund, and, goneril, and, proclaims, edmund, a, traitor, regan, falls, ill, having, been, poisoned, by, goneril, and, is, escorted, offstage, where, she, dies, edmund, defies, albany, who, calls, for, a, trial, by, combat, edgar, appears, masked, and, in, armour, and, challenges, edmund, to, a, duel, no, one, knows, who, he, is, edgar, wounds, edmund, fatally, though, edmund, does, not, die, immediately, albany, confronts, goneril, with, the, letter, which, was, intended, to, be, his, death, warrant, she, flees, in, shame, and, rage, edgar, reveals, himself, and, reports, that, gloucester, died, offstage, from, the, shock, and, joy, of, learning, that, edgar, is, alive, after, edgar, revealed, himself, to, his, father, offstage, goneril, her, plans, thwarted, commits, suicide, the, dying, edmund, decides, though, he, admits, it, is, against, his, own, character, to, try, to, save, lear, and, cordelia, but, his, confession, comes, too, late, soon, after, albany, sends, men, to, countermand, edmund, s, orders, lear, enters, bearing, cordelia, s, corpse, in, his, arms, having, survived, by, killing, the, executioner, kent, appears, and, lear, now, recognises, him, albany, urges, lear, to, resume, his, throne, but, as, with, gloucester, the, trials, lear, has, been, through, have, finally, overwhelmed, him, and, he, dies, albany, then, asks, kent, and, edgar, to, take, charge, of, the, throne, kent, declines, explaining, that, his, master, is, calling, him, on, a, journey, and, he, must, follow, shakespeare, s, play, is, based, on, various, accounts, of, the, semi, legendary, brythonic, figure, leir, of, britain, whose, name, has, been, linked, by, some, scholars, to, the, brythonic, god, lir, ll, r, though, in, actuality, the, names, are, not, etymologically, related, shakespeare, s, most, important, source, is, probably, the, second, edition, of, the, chronicles, of, england, scotlande, and, irelande, by, raphael, holinshed, published, in, 1587, holinshed, himself, found, the, story, in, the, earlier, historia, regum, britanniae, by, geoffrey, of, monmouth, which, was, written, in, the, 12th, century, edmund, spenser, s, the, faerie, queene, published, 1590, also, contains, a, character, named, cordelia, who, also, dies, from, hanging, as, in, king, lear, other, possible, sources, are, the, anonymous, play, king, leir, published, in, 1605, the, mirror, for, magistrates, 1574, by, john, higgins, the, malcontent, 1604, by, john, marston, the, london, prodigal, 1605, montaigne, s, essays, which, were, translated, into, english, by, john, florio, in, 1603, a, description, of, elizabethan, england, 1577, by, william, harrison, remains, concerning, britain, 1606, by, william, camden, albion, s, england, 1589, by, william, warner, and, a, declaration, of, egregious, popish, impostures, 1603, by, samuel, harsnett, which, provided, some, of, the, language, used, by, edgar, while, he, feigns, madness, king, lear, is, also, a, literary, variant, of, a, common, folk, tale, love, like, salt, aarne, thompson, type, 923, in, which, a, father, rejects, his, youngest, daughter, for, a, statement, of, her, love, that, does, not, please, him, the, source, of, the, subplot, involving, gloucester, edgar, and, edmund, is, a, tale, in, philip, sidney, s, countess, of, pembroke, s, arcadia, 1580, 90, with, a, blind, paphlagonian, king, and, his, two, sons, leonatus, and, plexitrus, besides, the, subplot, involving, the, earl, of, gloucester, and, his, sons, the, principal, innovation, shakespeare, made, to, this, story, was, the, death, of, cordelia, and, lear, at, the, end, in, the, account, by, geoffrey, of, monmouth, cordelia, restores, lear, to, the, throne, and, succeeds, him, as, ruler, after, his, death, during, the, 17th, century, shakespeare, s, tragic, ending, was, much, criticised, and, alternative, versions, were, written, by, nahum, tate, in, which, the, leading, characters, survived, and, edgar, and, cordelia, were, married, despite, the, fact, that, cordelia, was, previously, betrothed, to, the, king, of, france, as, harold, bloom, states, tate, s, version, held, the, stage, for, almost, 150, years, until, edmund, kean, reinstated, the, play, s, tragic, ending, in, 1823, holinshed, states, that, the, story, is, set, when, joash, was, king, of, judah, c, 800, bc, while, shakespeare, avoids, dating, the, setting, only, suggesting, that, it, is, sometime, in, the, pre, christian, era, with, numerous, anachronisms, such, as, anglo, saxon, names, and, titles, like, duke, and, earl, the, characters, of, earl, caius, of, kent, and, the, fool, were, created, wholly, by, shakespeare, in, order, to, engage, in, character, driven, conversations, with, lear, oswald, the, steward, the, confidant, of, goneril, was, created, as, a, similar, expository, device, shakespeare, s, lear, and, other, characters, make, oaths, to, jupiter, juno, and, apollo, while, the, presence, of, roman, religion, in, britain, is, technically, an, anachronism, nothing, was, known, about, any, religion, that, existed, in, britain, at, the, time, of, lear, s, alleged, life, holinshed, identifies, the, personal, names, of, the, duke, of, albany, maglanus, the, duke, of, cornwall, henninus, and, the, gallic, french, leader, aganippus, shakespeare, refers, to, these, characters, by, their, titles, only, and, also, changes, the, nature, of, albany, from, a, villain, to, a, hero, by, reassigning, albany, s, wicked, deeds, to, cornwall, maglanus, and, henninus, are, killed, in, the, final, battle, but, are, survived, by, their, sons, margan, and, cunedag, in, shakespeare, s, version, cornwall, is, killed, by, a, servant, who, objects, to, the, torture, of, the, earl, of, gloucester, while, albany, is, one, of, the, few, surviving, main, characters, isaac, asimov, surmised, that, this, alteration, was, due, to, the, title, duke, of, albany, being, held, in, 1606, by, prince, charles, the, younger, son, of, shakespeare, s, benefactor, king, james, however, this, explanation, is, faulty, because, james, older, son, prince, henry, held, the, title, duke, of, cornwall, at, the, same, time, there, is, no, direct, evidence, to, indicate, when, king, lear, was, written, or, first, performed, it, is, thought, to, have, been, composed, sometime, between, 1603, and, 1606, a, stationers, register, entry, notes, a, performance, before, james, i, on, 26, december, 1606, the, 1603, date, originates, from, words, in, edgar, s, speeches, which, may, derive, from, samuel, harsnett, s, declaration, of, egregious, popish, impostures, 1603, a, significant, issue, in, the, dating, of, the, play, is, the, relationship, of, king, lear, to, the, play, titled, the, true, chronicle, history, of, the, life, and, death, of, king, leir, and, his, three, daughters, which, was, published, for, the, first, time, after, its, entry, in, the, stationers, register, of, 8, may, 1605, this, play, had, a, significant, effect, on, shakespeare, and, his, close, study, of, it, suggests, that, he, was, using, a, printed, copy, which, suggests, a, composition, date, of, 1605, 06, conversely, frank, kermode, in, the, riverside, shakespeare, considers, the, publication, of, leir, to, have, been, a, response, to, performances, of, shakespeare, s, already, written, play, noting, a, sonnet, by, william, strachey, that, may, have, verbal, resemblances, with, lear, kermode, concludes, that, 1604, 05, seems, the, best, compromise, a, line, in, the, play, that, regards, these, late, eclipses, in, the, sun, and, moon, appears, to, refer, to, a, phenomenon, of, two, eclipses, that, occurred, over, london, within, a, few, days, of, each, other, the, lunar, eclipse, of, 27, september, 1605, and, the, solar, eclipse, of, 12, october, 1605, this, remarkable, pair, of, events, stirred, up, much, discussion, among, astrologers, edmund, s, line, a, prediction, i, read, this, other, day, apparently, refers, to, the, published, prognostications, of, the, astrologers, which, followed, after, the, eclipses, this, suggests, that, those, lines, in, act, i, were, written, sometime, after, both, the, eclipses, and, the, published, comments, the, modern, text, of, king, lear, derives, from, three, sources, two, quartos, one, published, in, 1608, q, 1, and, the, other, in, 1619, q, 2, and, the, version, in, the, first, folio, of, 1623, f, 1, q1, has, many, errors, and, muddles, q2, was, based, on, q1, it, introduced, corrections, and, new, errors, q2, also, informed, the, folio, text, quarto, and, folio, texts, differ, significantly, q, 1, contains, 285, lines, not, in, f, 1, f, 1, contains, around, 100, lines, not, in, q, 1, also, at, least, a, thousand, individual, words, are, changed, between, the, two, texts, each, text, has, different, styles, of, punctuation, and, about, half, the, verse, lines, in, the, f, 1, are, either, printed, as, prose, or, differently, divided, in, the, q, 1, early, editors, beginning, with, alexander, pope, conflated, the, two, texts, creating, the, modern, version, that, has, been, commonly, used, since, the, conflated, version, originated, with, the, assumptions, that, the, differences, in, the, versions, do, not, indicate, any, re, writing, by, the, author, that, shakespeare, wrote, only, one, original, manuscript, which, is, now, lost, and, that, the, quarto, and, folio, versions, contain, various, distortions, of, that, lost, original, in, 2021, duncan, salkeld, endorsed, this, view, suggesting, that, q1, was, typeset, by, a, reader, dictating, to, the, compositor, leading, to, many, slips, caused, by, mishearing, other, editors, such, as, nuttall, and, bloom, have, suggested, shakespeare, himself, maybe, was, involved, in, reworking, passages, in, the, play, to, accommodate, performances, and, other, textual, requirements, of, the, play, as, early, as, 1931, madeleine, doran, suggested, that, the, two, texts, had, independent, histories, and, that, these, differences, between, them, were, critically, interesting, this, argument, however, was, not, widely, discussed, until, the, late, 1970s, when, it, was, revived, principally, by, michael, warren, and, gary, taylor, who, discuss, a, variety, of, theories, including, doran, s, idea, that, the, quarto, may, have, been, printed, from, shakespeare, s, foul, papers, and, that, the, folio, may, have, been, printed, from, a, promptbook, prepared, for, a, production, the, new, cambridge, shakespeare, has, published, separate, editions, of, q, and, f, the, most, recent, pelican, shakespeare, edition, contains, both, the, 1608, quarto, and, the, 1623, folio, text, as, well, as, a, conflated, version, the, new, arden, edition, edited, by, r, a, foakes, offers, a, conflated, text, that, indicates, those, passages, that, are, found, only, in, q, or, f, both, anthony, nuttall, of, oxford, university, and, harold, bloom, of, yale, university, have, endorsed, the, view, of, shakespeare, having, revised, the, tragedy, at, least, once, during, his, lifetime, as, bloom, indicates, at, the, close, of, shakespeare, s, revised, king, lear, a, reluctant, edgar, becomes, king, of, britain, accepting, his, destiny, but, in, the, accents, of, despair, nuttall, speculates, that, edgar, like, shakespeare, himself, usurps, the, power, of, manipulating, the, audience, by, deceiving, poor, gloucester, what, we, know, of, shakespeare, s, wide, reading, and, powers, of, assimilation, seems, to, show, that, he, made, use, of, all, kinds, of, material, absorbing, contradictory, viewpoints, positive, and, negative, religious, and, secular, as, if, to, ensure, that, king, lear, would, offer, no, single, controlling, perspective, but, be, open, to, indeed, demand, multiple, interpretations, r, a, foakes, john, f, danby, in, his, shakespeare, s, doctrine, of, nature, a, study, of, king, lear, 1949, argues, that, lear, dramatizes, among, other, things, the, current, meanings, of, nature, the, words, nature, natural, and, unnatural, occur, over, forty, times, in, the, play, reflecting, a, debate, in, shakespeare, s, time, about, what, nature, really, was, like, this, debate, pervades, the, play, and, finds, symbolic, expression, in, lear, s, changing, attitude, to, thunder, there, are, two, strongly, contrasting, views, of, human, nature, in, the, play, that, of, the, lear, party, lear, gloucester, albany, kent, exemplifying, the, philosophy, of, bacon, and, hooker, and, that, of, the, edmund, party, edmund, cornwall, goneril, regan, akin, to, the, views, later, formulated, by, hobbes, though, the, latter, had, not, yet, begun, his, philosophy, career, when, lear, was, first, performed, along, with, the, two, views, of, nature, the, play, contains, two, views, of, reason, brought, out, in, gloucester, and, edmund, s, speeches, on, astrology, 1, 2, the, rationality, of, the, edmund, party, is, one, with, which, a, modern, audience, more, readily, identifies, but, the, edmund, party, carries, bold, rationalism, to, such, extremes, that, it, becomes, madness, a, madness, in, reason, the, ironic, counterpart, of, lear, s, reason, in, madness, iv, 6, 190, and, the, fool, s, wisdom, in, folly, this, betrayal, of, reason, lies, behind, the, play, s, later, emphasis, on, feeling, the, two, natures, and, the, two, reasons, imply, two, societies, edmund, is, the, new, man, a, member, of, an, age, of, competition, suspicion, glory, in, contrast, with, the, older, society, which, has, come, down, from, the, middle, ages, with, its, belief, in, co, operation, reasonable, decency, and, respect, for, the, whole, as, greater, than, the, part, king, lear, is, thus, an, allegory, the, older, society, that, of, the, medieval, vision, with, its, doting, king, falls, into, error, and, is, threatened, by, the, new, machiavellianism, it, is, regenerated, and, saved, by, a, vision, of, a, new, order, embodied, in, the, king, s, rejected, daughter, cordelia, in, the, allegorical, scheme, is, threefold, a, person, an, ethical, principle, love, and, a, community, nevertheless, shakespeare, s, understanding, of, the, new, man, is, so, extensive, as, to, amount, almost, to, sympathy, edmund, is, the, last, great, expression, in, shakespeare, of, that, side, of, renaissance, individualism, the, energy, the, emancipation, the, courage, which, has, made, a, positive, contribution, to, the, heritage, of, the, west, he, embodies, something, vital, which, a, final, synthesis, must, reaffirm, but, he, makes, an, absolute, claim, which, shakespeare, will, not, support, it, is, right, for, man, to, feel, as, edmund, does, that, society, exists, for, man, not, man, for, society, it, is, not, right, to, assert, the, kind, of, man, edmund, would, erect, to, this, supremacy, the, play, offers, an, alternative, to, the, feudal, machiavellian, polarity, an, alternative, foreshadowed, in, france, s, speech, i, 1, 245, 256, in, lear, and, gloucester, s, prayers, iii, 4, 28, 36, iv, 1, 61, 66, and, in, the, figure, of, cordelia, until, the, decent, society, is, achieved, we, are, meant, to, take, as, role, model, though, qualified, by, shakespearean, ironies, edgar, the, machiavel, of, goodness, endurance, courage, and, ripeness, the, play, also, contains, references, to, disputes, between, king, james, i, and, parliament, in, the, 1604, elections, to, the, house, of, commons, sir, john, fortescue, the, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, was, defeated, by, a, member, of, the, buckinghamshire, gentry, sir, francis, goodwin, displeased, with, the, result, james, declared, the, result, of, the, buckinghhamshire, election, invalid, and, swore, in, fortescue, as, the, mp, for, buckinghamshire, while, the, house, of, commons, insisted, on, swearing, in, goodwin, leading, to, a, clash, between, king, and, parliament, over, who, had, the, right, to, decide, who, sat, in, the, house, of, commons, the, mp, thomas, wentworth, the, son, of, another, mp, peter, wentworth, often, imprisoned, under, elizabeth, for, raising, the, question, of, the, succession, in, the, commons, was, most, forceful, in, protesting, james, s, attempts, to, reduce, the, powers, of, the, house, of, commons, saying, the, king, could, not, just, declare, the, results, of, an, election, invalid, if, he, disliked, who, had, won, the, seat, as, he, was, insisting, that, he, could, the, character, of, kent, resembles, peter, wentworth, in, the, way, which, is, tactless, and, blunt, in, advising, lear, but, his, point, is, valid, that, lear, should, be, more, careful, with, his, friends, and, advisers, just, as, the, house, of, commons, had, argued, to, james, that, their, loyalty, was, to, the, constitution, of, england, not, to, the, king, personally, kent, insists, his, loyalty, is, institutional, not, personal, as, he, is, loyal, to, the, realm, of, which, the, king, is, head, not, to, lear, himself, and, he, tells, lear, to, behave, better, for, the, good, of, the, realm, by, contrast, lear, makes, an, argument, similar, to, james, that, as, king, he, holds, absolute, power, and, could, disregard, the, views, of, his, subjects, if, they, displease, him, whenever, he, liked, in, the, play, the, characters, like, the, fool, kent, and, cordelia, whose, loyalties, are, institutional, seeing, their, first, loyalty, to, the, realm, are, portrayed, more, favorably, than, those, like, regan, and, goneril, who, insist, they, are, only, loyal, to, the, king, seeing, their, loyalties, as, personal, likewise, james, was, notorious, for, his, riotous, debauched, lifestyle, and, his, preference, for, sycophantic, courtiers, who, were, forever, singing, his, praises, out, of, the, hope, for, advancement, aspects, of, his, court, that, closely, resemble, the, court, of, king, lear, who, starts, out, in, the, play, with, a, riotous, debauched, court, of, sycophantic, courtiers, kent, criticises, oswald, as, a, man, unworthy, of, office, who, has, only, been, promoted, because, of, his, sycophancy, telling, lear, that, he, should, be, loyal, to, those, who, are, willing, to, tell, him, the, truth, a, statement, that, many, in, england, wished, that, james, would, heed, furthermore, james, vi, of, scotland, inherited, the, throne, of, england, upon, the, death, of, elizabeth, i, in, 1603, thereby, uniting, the, kingdoms, of, the, island, of, britain, into, one, and, a, major, issue, of, his, reign, was, the, attempt, to, forge, a, common, british, identity, james, had, given, his, sons, henry, and, charles, the, titles, of, duke, of, cornwall, and, duke, of, albany, the, same, titles, borne, by, the, men, married, to, regan, and, goneril, the, play, begins, with, lear, ruling, all, of, britain, and, ends, with, him, destroying, his, realm, the, critic, andrew, hadfield, argued, that, the, division, of, britain, by, lear, was, an, inversion, of, the, unification, of, britain, by, james, who, believed, his, policies, would, result, in, a, well, governed, and, prosperous, unified, realm, being, passed, on, to, his, heir, hadfield, argued, that, the, play, was, meant, as, a, warning, to, james, as, in, the, play, a, monarch, loses, everything, by, giving, in, to, his, sycophantic, courtiers, who, only, seek, to, use, him, while, neglecting, those, who, truly, loved, him, hadfield, also, argued, that, the, world, of, lear, s, court, is, childish, with, lear, presenting, himself, as, the, father, of, the, nation, and, requiring, all, of, his, subjects, not, just, his, children, to, address, him, in, paternal, terms, which, infantises, most, of, the, people, around, him, which, pointedly, references, james, s, statement, in, his, 1598, book, the, trew, law, of, free, monarchies, that, the, king, is, the, father, of, the, nation, for, whom, all, of, his, subjects, are, his, children, king, lear, provides, a, basis, for, the, primary, enactment, of, psychic, breakdown, in, english, literary, history, the, play, begins, with, lear, s, near, fairytale, narcissism, given, the, absence, of, legitimate, mothers, in, king, lear, copp, lia, kahn, provides, a, psychoanalytic, interpretation, of, the, maternal, subtext, found, in, the, play, according, to, kahn, lear, s, old, age, forces, him, to, regress, into, an, infantile, disposition, and, he, now, seeks, a, love, that, is, traditionally, satisfied, by, a, mothering, woman, but, in, the, absence, of, a, real, mother, his, daughters, become, the, mother, figures, lear, s, contest, of, love, between, goneril, regan, and, cordelia, serves, as, the, binding, agreement, his, daughters, will, get, their, inheritance, provided, that, they, care, for, him, especially, cordelia, on, whose, kind, nursery, he, will, greatly, depend, cordelia, s, refusal, to, dedicate, herself, to, him, and, love, him, as, more, than, a, father, has, been, interpreted, by, some, as, a, resistance, to, incest, but, kahn, also, inserts, the, image, of, a, rejecting, mother, the, situation, is, now, a, reversal, of, parent, child, roles, in, which, lear, s, madness, is, a, childlike, rage, due, to, his, deprivation, of, filial, maternal, care, even, when, lear, and, cordelia, are, captured, together, his, madness, persists, as, lear, envisions, a, nursery, in, prison, where, cordelia, s, sole, existence, is, for, him, it, is, only, with, cordelia, s, death, that, his, fantasy, of, a, daughter, mother, ultimately, diminishes, as, king, lear, concludes, with, only, male, characters, living, sigmund, freud, asserted, that, cordelia, symbolises, death, therefore, when, the, play, begins, with, lear, rejecting, his, daughter, it, can, be, interpreted, as, him, rejecting, death, lear, is, unwilling, to, face, the, finitude, of, his, being, the, play, s, poignant, ending, scene, wherein, lear, carries, the, body, of, his, beloved, cordelia, was, of, great, importance, to, freud, in, this, scene, cordelia, forces, the, realization, of, his, finitude, or, as, freud, put, it, she, causes, him, to, make, friends, with, the, necessity, of, dying, alternatively, an, analysis, based, on, adlerian, theory, suggests, that, the, king, s, contest, among, his, daughters, in, act, i, has, more, to, do, with, his, control, over, the, unmarried, cordelia, this, theory, indicates, that, the, king, s, dethronement, might, have, led, him, to, seek, control, that, he, lost, after, he, divided, his, land, in, his, study, of, the, character, portrayal, of, edmund, harold, bloom, refers, to, him, as, shakespeare, s, most, original, character, as, hazlitt, pointed, out, writes, bloom, edmund, does, not, share, in, the, hypocrisy, of, goneril, and, regan, his, machiavellianism, is, absolutely, pure, and, lacks, an, oedipal, motive, freud, s, vision, of, family, romances, simply, does, not, apply, to, edmund, iago, is, free, to, reinvent, himself, every, minute, yet, iago, has, strong, passions, however, negative, edmund, has, no, passions, whatsoever, he, has, never, loved, anyone, and, he, never, will, in, that, respect, he, is, shakespeare, s, most, original, character, the, tragedy, of, lear, s, lack, of, understanding, of, the, consequences, of, his, demands, and, actions, is, often, observed, to, be, like, that, of, a, spoiled, child, but, it, has, also, been, noted, that, his, behaviour, is, equally, likely, to, be, seen, in, parents, who, have, never, adjusted, to, their, children, having, grown, up, critics, are, divided, on, the, question, of, whether, king, lear, represents, an, affirmation, of, a, particular, christian, doctrine, those, who, think, it, does, posit, different, arguments, which, include, the, significance, of, lear, s, self, divestment, for, some, critics, this, reflects, the, christian, concepts, of, the, fall, of, the, mighty, and, the, inevitable, loss, of, worldly, possessions, by, 1569, sermons, delivered, at, court, such, as, those, at, windsor, declared, how, rich, men, are, rich, dust, wise, men, wise, dust, from, him, that, weareth, purple, and, beareth, the, crown, down, to, him, that, is, clad, with, meanest, apparel, there, is, nothing, but, garboil, and, ruffle, and, hoisting, and, lingering, wrath, and, fear, of, death, and, death, itself, and, hunger, and, many, a, whip, of, god, some, see, this, in, cordelia, and, what, she, symbolised, that, the, material, body, are, mere, husks, that, would, eventually, be, discarded, so, that, the, fruit, can, be, reached, among, those, who, argue, that, lear, is, redeemed, in, the, christian, sense, through, suffering, are, a, c, bradley, and, john, reibetanz, who, has, written, through, his, sufferings, lear, has, won, an, enlightened, soul, other, critics, who, find, no, evidence, of, redemption, and, emphasise, the, horrors, of, the, final, act, include, john, holloway, and, marvin, rosenberg, william, r, elton, stresses, the, pre, christian, setting, of, the, play, writing, that, lear, fulfills, the, criteria, for, pagan, behavior, in, life, falling, into, total, blasphemy, at, the, moment, of, his, irredeemable, loss, this, is, related, to, the, way, some, sources, cite, that, at, the, end, of, the, narrative, king, lear, raged, against, heaven, before, eventually, dying, in, despair, with, the, death, of, cordelia, harold, bloom, argues, that, king, lear, transcends, a, morality, system, entirely, and, thus, is, one, of, the, major, triumphs, of, the, play, bloom, writes, that, in, the, play, there, is, no, theology, no, metaphysics, no, ethics, king, lear, has, been, performed, by, esteemed, actors, since, the, 17th, century, when, men, played, all, the, roles, from, the, 20th, century, a, number, of, women, have, played, male, roles, in, the, play, most, commonly, the, fool, who, has, been, played, among, others, by, judy, davis, emma, thompson, and, robyn, nevin, lear, himself, has, been, played, by, marianne, hoppe, in, 1990, by, janet, wright, in, 1995, by, kathryn, hunter, in, 1996, 97, and, by, glenda, jackson, in, 2016, and, 2019, shakespeare, wrote, the, role, of, lear, for, his, company, s, chief, tragedian, richard, burbage, for, whom, shakespeare, was, writing, incrementally, older, characters, as, their, careers, progressed, it, has, been, speculated, either, that, the, role, of, the, fool, was, written, for, the, company, s, clown, robert, armin, or, that, it, was, written, for, performance, by, one, of, the, company, s, boys, doubling, the, role, of, cordelia, only, one, specific, performance, of, the, play, during, shakespeare, s, lifetime, is, known, before, the, court, of, king, james, i, at, whitehall, on, 26, december, 1606, its, original, performances, would, have, been, at, the, globe, where, there, were, no, sets, in, the, modern, sense, and, characters, would, have, signified, their, roles, visually, with, props, and, costumes, lear, s, costume, for, example, would, have, changed, in, the, course, of, the, play, as, his, status, diminished, commencing, in, crown, and, regalia, then, as, a, huntsman, raging, bareheaded, in, the, storm, scene, and, finally, crowned, with, flowers, in, parody, of, his, original, status, all, theatres, were, closed, down, by, the, puritan, government, on, 6, september, 1642, upon, the, restoration, of, the, monarchy, in, 1660, two, patent, companies, the, king, s, company, and, the, duke, s, company, were, established, and, the, existing, theatrical, repertoire, divided, between, them, and, from, the, restoration, until, the, mid, 19th, century, the, performance, history, of, king, lear, is, not, the, story, of, shakespeare, s, version, but, instead, of, the, history, of, king, lear, a, popular, adaptation, by, nahum, tate, its, most, significant, deviations, from, shakespeare, were, to, omit, the, fool, entirely, to, introduce, a, happy, ending, in, which, lear, and, cordelia, survive, and, to, develop, a, love, story, between, cordelia, and, edgar, two, characters, who, never, interact, in, shakespeare, which, ends, with, their, marriage, like, most, restoration, adapters, of, shakespeare, tate, admired, shakespeare, s, natural, genius, but, saw, fit, to, augment, his, work, with, contemporary, standards, of, art, which, were, largely, guided, by, the, neoclassical, unities, of, time, place, and, action, tate, s, struggle, to, strike, a, balance, between, raw, nature, and, refined, art, is, apparent, in, his, description, of, the, tragedy, a, heap, of, jewels, unstrung, and, unpolish, t, yet, so, dazzling, in, their, disorder, that, i, soon, perceiv, d, i, had, seiz, d, a, treasure, other, changes, included, giving, cordelia, a, confidante, named, arante, bringing, the, play, closer, to, contemporary, notions, of, poetic, justice, and, adding, titilating, material, such, as, amorous, encounters, between, edmund, and, both, regan, and, goneril, a, scene, in, which, edgar, rescues, cordelia, from, edmund, s, attempted, kidnapping, and, rape, and, a, scene, in, which, cordelia, wears, men, s, pants, that, would, reveal, the, actress, s, ankles, the, play, ends, with, a, celebration, of, the, king, s, blest, restauration, an, obvious, reference, to, charles, ii, in, the, early, 18th, century, some, writers, began, to, express, objections, to, this, and, other, restoration, adaptations, of, shakespeare, for, example, in, the, spectator, on, 16, april, 1711, joseph, addison, wrote, king, lear, is, an, admirable, tragedy, as, shakespeare, wrote, it, but, as, it, is, reformed, according, to, the, chymerical, notion, of, poetical, justice, in, my, humble, opinion, it, hath, lost, half, its, beauty, yet, on, the, stage, tate, s, version, prevailed, david, garrick, was, the, first, actor, manager, to, begin, to, cut, back, on, elements, of, tate, s, adaptation, in, favour, of, shakespeare, s, original, he, retained, tate, s, major, changes, including, the, happy, ending, but, removed, many, of, tate, s, lines, including, edgar, s, closing, speech, he, also, reduced, the, prominence, of, the, edgar, cordelia, love, story, in, order, to, focus, more, on, the, relationship, between, lear, and, his, daughters, his, version, had, a, powerful, emotional, impact, lear, driven, to, madness, by, his, daughters, was, in, the, words, of, one, spectator, arthur, murphy, the, finest, tragic, distress, ever, seen, on, any, stage, and, in, contrast, the, devotion, shown, to, lear, by, cordelia, a, mix, of, shakespeare, s, tate, s, and, garrick, s, contributions, to, the, part, moved, the, audience, to, tears, the, first, professional, performances, of, king, lear, in, north, america, are, likely, to, have, been, those, of, the, hallam, company, later, the, american, company, which, arrived, in, virginia, in, 1752, and, who, counted, the, play, among, their, repertoire, by, the, time, of, their, departure, for, jamaica, in, 1774, charles, lamb, established, the, romantics, attitude, to, king, lear, in, his, 1811, essay, on, the, tragedies, of, shakespeare, considered, with, reference, to, their, fitness, for, stage, representation, where, he, says, that, the, play, is, essentially, impossible, to, be, represented, on, the, stage, preferring, to, experience, it, in, the, study, in, the, theatre, he, argues, to, see, lear, acted, to, see, an, old, man, tottering, about, the, stage, with, a, walking, stick, turned, out, of, doors, by, his, daughters, on, a, rainy, night, has, nothing, in, it, but, what, is, painful, and, disgusting, yet, while, we, read, it, we, see, not, lear, but, we, are, lear, we, are, in, his, mind, we, are, sustained, by, a, grandeur, which, baffles, the, malice, of, daughters, and, storms, literary, critic, janet, ruth, heller, elaborates, on, the, hostility, of, lamb, samuel, taylor, coleridge, and, william, hazlitt, to, performances, of, tragedy, especially, shakespearean, tragedy, they, believed, that, such, stagings, appealed, more, to, the, senses, than, the, imagination, however, reading, stimulates, the, imagination, also, heller, traces, the, history, of, the, idea, that, tragedy, should, be, read, not, performed, back, to, plato, and, to, misreadings, of, aristotle, s, poetics, see, coleridge, lamb, hazlitt, and, the, reader, of, drama, university, of, missouri, press, 1990, king, lear, was, politically, controversial, during, the, period, of, george, iii, s, madness, and, as, a, result, was, not, performed, at, all, in, the, two, professional, theatres, of, london, from, 1811, to, 1820, but, was, then, the, subject, of, major, productions, in, both, within, three, months, of, his, death, the, 19th, century, saw, the, gradual, reintroduction, of, shakespeare, s, text, to, displace, tate, s, version, like, garrick, before, him, john, philip, kemble, had, introduced, more, of, shakespeare, s, text, while, still, preserving, the, three, main, elements, of, tate, s, version, the, love, story, the, omission, of, the, fool, and, the, happy, ending, edmund, kean, played, king, lear, with, its, tragic, ending, in, 1823, but, failed, and, reverted, to, tate, s, crowd, pleaser, after, only, three, performances, at, last, in, 1838, william, macready, at, covent, garden, performed, shakespeare, s, version, freed, from, tate, s, adaptions, the, restored, character, of, the, fool, was, played, by, an, actress, priscilla, horton, as, in, the, words, of, one, spectator, a, fragile, hectic, beautiful, faced, half, idiot, looking, boy, and, helen, faucit, s, final, appearance, as, cordelia, dead, in, her, father, s, arms, became, one, of, the, most, iconic, of, victorian, images, john, forster, writing, in, the, examiner, on, 14, february, 1838, expressed, the, hope, that, mr, macready, s, success, has, banished, that, disgrace, from, the, stage, for, ever, but, even, this, version, was, not, close, to, shakespeare, s, the, 19th, century, actor, managers, heavily, cut, shakespeare, s, scripts, ending, scenes, on, big, curtain, effects, and, reducing, or, eliminating, supporting, roles, to, give, greater, prominence, to, the, star, one, of, macready, s, innovations, the, use, of, stonehenge, like, structures, on, stage, to, indicate, an, ancient, setting, proved, enduring, on, stage, into, the, 20th, century, and, can, be, seen, in, the, 1983, television, version, starring, laurence, olivier, in, 1843, the, act, for, regulating, the, theatres, came, into, force, bringing, an, end, to, the, monopolies, of, the, two, existing, companies, and, by, doing, so, increased, the, number, of, theatres, in, london, at, the, same, time, the, fashion, in, theatre, was, pictorial, valuing, visual, spectacle, above, plot, or, characterisation, and, often, required, lengthy, and, time, consuming, scene, changes, for, example, henry, irving, s, 1892, king, lear, offered, spectacles, such, as, lear, s, death, beneath, a, cliff, at, dover, his, face, lit, by, the, red, glow, of, a, setting, sun, at, the, expense, of, cutting, 46, of, the, text, including, the, blinding, of, gloucester, but, irving, s, production, clearly, evoked, strong, emotions, one, spectator, gordon, crosse, wrote, of, the, first, entrance, of, lear, a, striking, figure, with, masses, of, white, hair, he, is, leaning, on, a, huge, scabbarded, sword, which, he, raises, with, a, wild, cry, in, answer, to, the, shouted, greeting, of, his, guards, his, gait, his, looks, his, gestures, all, reveal, the, noble, imperious, mind, already, degenerating, into, senile, irritability, under, the, coming, shocks, of, grief, and, age, the, importance, of, pictorialism, to, irving, and, to, other, theatre, professionals, of, the, victorian, era, is, exemplified, by, the, fact, that, irving, had, used, ford, madox, brown, s, painting, cordelia, s, portion, as, the, inspiration, for, the, look, of, his, production, and, that, the, artist, himself, was, brought, in, to, provide, sketches, for, the, settings, of, other, scenes, a, reaction, against, pictorialism, came, with, the, rise, of, the, reconstructive, movement, believers, in, a, simple, style, of, staging, more, similar, to, that, which, would, have, pertained, in, renaissance, theatres, whose, chief, early, exponent, was, the, actor, manager, william, poel, poel, was, influenced, by, a, performance, of, king, lear, directed, by, jocza, savits, at, the, hoftheater, in, munich, in, 1890, set, on, an, apron, stage, with, a, three, tier, globe, like, reconstruction, theatre, as, its, backdrop, poel, would, use, this, same, configuration, for, his, own, shakespearean, performances, in, 1893, by, mid, century, the, actor, manager, tradition, had, declined, to, be, replaced, by, a, structure, in, which, the, major, theatre, companies, employed, professional, directors, as, auteurs, the, last, of, the, great, actor, managers, donald, wolfit, played, lear, in, 1944, on, a, stonehenge, like, set, and, was, praised, by, james, agate, as, the, greatest, piece, of, shakespearean, acting, since, i, have, been, privileged, to, write, for, the, sunday, times, wolfit, supposedly, drank, eight, bottles, of, guinness, in, the, course, of, each, performance, the, character, of, lear, in, the, 19th, century, was, often, that, of, a, frail, old, man, from, the, opening, scene, but, lears, of, the, 20th, century, often, began, the, play, as, strong, men, displaying, regal, authority, including, john, gielgud, donald, wolfit, and, donald, sinden, cordelia, also, evolved, in, the, 20th, century, earlier, cordelias, had, often, been, praised, for, being, sweet, innocent, and, modest, but, 20th, century, cordelias, were, often, portrayed, as, war, leaders, for, example, peggy, ashcroft, at, the, rst, in, 1950, played, the, role, in, a, breastplate, and, carrying, a, sword, similarly, the, fool, evolved, through, the, course, of, the, century, with, portrayals, often, deriving, from, the, music, hall, or, circus, tradition,
