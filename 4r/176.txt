a, father, figure, to, tiny, tim, from, then, on, scrooge, treats, everyone, with, kindness, generosity, and, compassion, embodying, the, spirit, of, christmas, the, writer, charles, dickens, was, born, to, a, middle, class, family, which, got, into, financial, difficulties, as, a, result, of, the, spendthrift, nature, of, his, father, john, in, 1824, john, was, committed, to, the, marshalsea, a, debtors, prison, in, southwark, london, dickens, aged, 12, was, forced, to, pawn, his, collection, of, books, leave, school, and, work, at, a, dirty, and, rat, infested, shoe, blacking, factory, the, change, in, circumstances, gave, him, what, his, biographer, michael, slater, describes, as, a, deep, personal, and, social, outrage, which, heavily, influenced, his, writing, and, outlook, by, the, end, of, 1842, dickens, was, a, well, established, author, with, six, major, works, as, well, as, several, short, stories, novellas, and, other, pieces, on, 31, december, that, year, he, began, publishing, his, novel, martin, chuzzlewit, as, a, monthly, serial, it, was, his, favourite, work, but, sales, were, disappointing, and, he, faced, temporary, financial, difficulties, celebrating, the, christmas, season, had, been, growing, in, popularity, through, the, victorian, era, the, christmas, tree, was, introduced, in, britain, during, the, 18th, century, and, its, use, was, popularised, by, queen, victoria, and, prince, albert, in, the, early, 19th, century, there, had, been, a, revival, of, interest, in, christmas, carols, following, a, decline, in, popularity, over, the, previous, hundred, years, the, publication, of, davies, gilbert, s, 1823, work, some, ancient, christmas, carols, with, the, tunes, to, which, they, were, formerly, sung, in, the, west, of, england, and, william, sandys, s, 1833, collection, christmas, carols, ancient, and, modern, led, to, a, growth, in, the, form, s, popularity, in, britain, dickens, had, an, interest, in, christmas, and, his, first, story, on, the, subject, was, christmas, festivities, published, in, bell, s, weekly, messenger, in, 1835, the, story, was, then, published, as, a, christmas, dinner, in, sketches, by, boz, 1836, the, story, of, the, goblins, who, stole, a, sexton, another, christmas, story, appeared, in, the, 1836, novel, the, pickwick, papers, in, the, episode, a, mr, wardle, describes, a, misanthropic, sexton, gabriel, grub, who, undergoes, a, christmas, conversion, after, being, visited, by, goblins, who, show, him, the, past, and, future, slater, considers, that, the, main, elements, of, the, carol, are, present, in, the, story, but, not, yet, in, a, firm, form, the, story, is, followed, by, a, passage, about, christmas, in, dickens, s, editorial, master, humphrey, s, clock, the, professor, of, english, literature, paul, davis, writes, that, although, the, goblins, story, appears, to, be, a, prototype, of, a, christmas, carol, all, dickens, s, earlier, writings, about, christmas, influenced, the, story, dickens, was, not, the, first, author, to, celebrate, the, christmas, season, in, literature, among, earlier, authors, who, influenced, dickens, was, washington, irving, whose, 1819, 20, work, the, sketch, book, of, geoffrey, crayon, gent, included, four, essays, on, old, english, christmas, traditions, that, he, experienced, while, staying, at, aston, hall, near, birmingham, the, tales, and, essays, attracted, dickens, and, the, two, authors, shared, the, belief, that, returning, to, christmas, traditions, might, promote, a, type, of, social, connection, that, they, felt, had, been, lost, in, the, modern, world, several, works, may, have, had, an, influence, on, the, writing, of, a, christmas, carol, including, two, douglas, jerrold, essays, one, from, an, 1841, issue, of, punch, how, mr, chokepear, keeps, a, merry, christmas, and, one, from, 1843, the, beauties, of, the, police, more, broadly, dickens, was, influenced, by, fairy, tales, and, nursery, stories, which, he, closely, associated, with, christmas, because, he, saw, them, as, stories, of, conversion, and, transformation, dickens, was, touched, by, the, lot, of, poor, children, in, the, middle, decades, of, the, 19th, century, in, early, 1843, he, toured, the, cornish, tin, mines, where, he, was, angered, by, seeing, children, working, in, appalling, conditions, the, suffering, he, witnessed, there, was, reinforced, by, a, visit, to, the, field, lane, ragged, school, one, of, several, london, schools, set, up, for, the, education, of, the, capital, s, half, starved, illiterate, street, children, in, february, 1843, the, second, report, of, the, children, s, employment, commission, was, published, it, was, a, parliamentary, report, exposing, the, effects, of, the, industrial, revolution, upon, working, class, children, horrified, by, what, he, read, dickens, planned, to, publish, an, inexpensive, political, pamphlet, tentatively, titled, an, appeal, to, the, people, of, england, on, behalf, of, the, poor, man, s, child, but, changed, his, mind, deferring, the, pamphlet, s, production, until, the, end, of, the, year, in, march, he, wrote, to, dr, southwood, smith, one, of, the, four, commissioners, responsible, for, the, second, report, about, his, change, in, plans, you, will, certainly, feel, that, a, sledge, hammer, has, come, down, with, twenty, times, the, force, twenty, thousand, times, the, force, i, could, exert, by, following, out, my, first, idea, in, a, fundraising, speech, on, 5, october, 1843, at, the, manchester, athenaeum, dickens, urged, workers, and, employers, to, join, together, to, combat, ignorance, with, educational, reform, and, realised, in, the, days, following, that, the, most, effective, way, to, reach, the, broadest, segment, of, the, population, with, his, social, concerns, about, poverty, and, injustice, was, to, write, a, deeply, felt, christmas, narrative, rather, than, polemical, pamphlets, and, essays, by, mid, 1843, dickens, began, to, suffer, from, financial, problems, sales, of, martin, chuzzlewit, were, falling, off, and, his, wife, catherine, was, pregnant, with, their, fifth, child, matters, worsened, when, chapman, hall, his, publishers, threatened, to, reduce, his, monthly, income, by, 50, if, sales, dropped, further, he, began, a, christmas, carol, in, october, 1843, michael, slater, dickens, s, biographer, describes, the, book, as, being, written, at, white, heat, it, was, completed, in, six, weeks, the, final, pages, being, written, in, early, december, he, built, much, of, the, work, in, his, head, while, taking, night, time, walks, of, 15, to, 20, miles, 24, to, 32, km, around, london, dickens, s, sister, in, law, wrote, how, he, wept, and, laughed, and, wept, again, and, excited, himself, in, a, most, extraordinary, manner, in, composition, slater, says, that, a, christmas, carol, was, intended, to, open, its, readers, hearts, towards, those, struggling, to, survive, on, the, lower, rungs, of, the, economic, ladder, and, to, encourage, practical, benevolence, but, also, to, warn, of, the, terrible, danger, to, society, created, by, the, toleration, of, widespread, ignorance, and, actual, want, among, the, poor, george, cruikshank, the, illustrator, who, had, earlier, worked, with, dickens, on, sketches, by, boz, 1836, and, oliver, twist, 1838, introduced, him, to, the, caricaturist, john, leech, by, 24, october, dickens, invited, leech, to, work, on, a, christmas, carol, and, four, hand, coloured, etchings, and, four, black, and, white, wood, engravings, by, the, artist, accompanied, the, text, dickens, s, hand, written, manuscript, of, the, story, does, not, include, the, sentence, in, the, penultimate, paragraph, and, to, tiny, tim, who, did, not, die, this, was, added, later, during, the, printing, process, the, central, character, of, a, christmas, carol, is, ebenezer, scrooge, a, miserly, london, based, businessman, described, in, the, story, as, a, squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old, sinner, kelly, writes, that, scrooge, may, have, been, influenced, by, dickens, s, conflicting, feelings, for, his, father, whom, he, both, loved, and, demonised, this, psychological, conflict, may, be, responsible, for, the, two, radically, different, scrooges, in, the, tale, one, a, cold, stingy, and, greedy, semi, recluse, the, other, a, benevolent, sociable, man, the, professor, of, english, literature, robert, douglas, fairhurst, considers, that, in, the, opening, part, of, the, book, covering, young, scrooge, s, lonely, and, unhappy, childhood, and, his, aspiration, for, money, to, avoid, poverty, is, something, of, a, self, parody, of, dickens, s, fears, about, himself, the, post, transformation, parts, of, the, book, are, how, dickens, optimistically, sees, himself, scrooge, could, also, be, based, on, two, misers, the, eccentric, john, elwes, mp, or, jemmy, wood, the, owner, of, the, gloucester, old, bank, and, also, known, as, the, gloucester, miser, according, to, the, sociologist, frank, w, elwell, scrooge, s, views, on, the, poor, are, a, reflection, of, those, of, the, demographer, and, political, economist, thomas, malthus, while, the, miser, s, questions, are, there, no, prisons, and, the, union, workhouses, the, treadmill, and, the, poor, law, are, in, full, vigour, then, are, a, reflection, of, a, sarcastic, question, raised, by, the, philosopher, thomas, carlyle, are, there, not, treadmills, gibbets, even, hospitals, poor, rates, new, poor, law, there, are, literary, precursors, for, scrooge, in, dickens, s, own, works, peter, ackroyd, dickens, s, biographer, sees, similarities, between, the, character, and, the, elder, martin, chuzzlewit, character, although, the, miser, is, a, more, fantastic, image, than, the, chuzzlewit, patriarch, ackroyd, observes, that, chuzzlewit, s, transformation, to, a, charitable, figure, is, a, parallel, to, that, of, the, miser, douglas, fairhurst, sees, that, the, minor, character, gabriel, grub, from, the, pickwick, papers, was, also, an, influence, when, creating, scrooge, it, is, possible, that, scrooge, s, name, came, from, a, tombstone, dickens, had, seen, on, a, visit, to, edinburgh, the, grave, was, for, ebenezer, lennox, scroggie, whose, job, was, given, as, a, meal, man, a, corn, merchant, dickens, misread, the, inscription, as, mean, man, this, theory, has, been, described, as, a, probable, dickens, hoax, for, which, o, one, could, find, any, corroborating, evidence, when, dickens, was, young, he, lived, near, a, tradesman, s, premises, with, the, sign, goodge, and, marney, which, may, have, provided, the, name, for, scrooge, s, former, business, partner, for, the, chained, marley, dickens, drew, on, his, memory, of, a, visit, to, the, western, penitentiary, in, pittsburgh, pennsylvania, in, march, 1842, where, he, saw, and, was, affected, by, seeing, fettered, prisoners, for, the, character, tiny, tim, dickens, used, his, nephew, henry, augustus, burnett, a, disabled, boy, who, was, five, at, the, time, a, christmas, carol, was, written, the, two, figures, of, want, and, ignorance, sheltering, in, the, robes, of, the, ghost, of, christmas, present, were, inspired, by, the, children, dickens, had, seen, on, his, visit, to, a, ragged, school, in, the, east, end, of, london, the, transformation, of, scrooge, is, central, to, the, story, davis, considers, scrooge, to, be, a, protean, figure, always, in, process, of, reformation, kelly, writes, that, the, transformation, is, reflected, in, the, description, of, scrooge, who, begins, as, a, two, dimensional, character, but, who, then, grows, into, one, who, possess, an, emotional, depth, a, regret, for, lost, opportunities, some, writers, including, the, dickens, scholar, grace, moore, consider, that, there, is, a, christian, theme, running, through, a, christmas, carol, and, that, the, novella, should, be, seen, as, an, allegory, of, the, christian, concept, of, redemption, dickens, s, biographer, claire, tomalin, sees, the, conversion, of, scrooge, as, carrying, the, christian, message, that, even, the, worst, of, sinners, may, repent, and, become, a, good, man, dickens, s, attitudes, towards, organised, religion, were, complex, he, based, his, beliefs, and, principles, on, the, new, testament, his, statement, that, marley, had, no, bowels, is, a, reference, to, the, bowels, of, compassion, mentioned, in, the, first, epistle, of, john, the, reason, for, his, eternal, damnation, other, writers, including, kelly, consider, that, dickens, put, forward, a, secular, vision, of, this, sacred, holiday, the, dickens, scholar, john, o, jordan, argues, that, a, christmas, carol, shows, what, dickens, referred, to, in, a, letter, to, his, friend, john, forster, as, his, carol, philosophy, cheerful, views, sharp, anatomisation, of, humbug, jolly, good, temper, and, a, vein, of, glowing, hearty, generous, mirthful, beaming, reference, in, everything, to, home, and, fireside, from, a, secular, viewpoint, the, cultural, historian, penne, restad, suggests, that, scrooge, s, redemption, underscores, the, conservative, individualistic, and, patriarchal, aspects, of, dickens, s, carol, philosophy, of, charity, and, altruism, dickens, wrote, a, christmas, carol, in, response, to, british, social, attitudes, towards, poverty, particularly, child, poverty, and, wished, to, use, the, novella, as, a, means, to, put, forward, his, arguments, against, it, the, story, shows, scrooge, as, a, paradigm, for, self, interest, and, the, possible, repercussions, of, ignoring, the, poor, especially, children, personified, by, the, allegorical, figures, of, want, and, ignorance, the, two, figures, were, created, to, arouse, sympathy, with, readers, as, was, tiny, tim, douglas, fairhurst, observes, that, the, use, of, such, figures, allowed, dickens, to, present, his, message, of, the, need, for, charity, without, alienating, his, largely, middle, class, readership, as, the, result, of, the, disagreements, with, chapman, and, hall, over, the, commercial, failures, of, martin, chuzzlewit, dickens, arranged, to, pay, for, the, publishing, himself, in, exchange, for, a, percentage, of, the, profits, production, of, a, christmas, carol, was, not, without, problems, the, first, printing, was, meant, to, have, festive, green, endpapers, but, they, came, out, a, dull, olive, colour, dickens, publisher, chapman, and, hall, replaced, these, with, yellow, endpapers, and, reworked, the, title, page, in, harmonising, red, and, blue, shades, the, final, product, was, bound, in, red, cloth, with, gilt, edged, pages, completed, only, two, days, before, the, publication, date, of, 19, december, 1843, following, publication, dickens, arranged, for, the, manuscript, to, be, bound, in, red, morocco, leather, and, presented, as, a, gift, to, his, solicitor, thomas, mitton, priced, at, five, shillings, equal, to, 31, in, 2024, pounds, the, first, run, of, 6, 000, copies, sold, out, by, christmas, eve, chapman, and, hall, issued, second, and, third, editions, before, the, new, year, and, the, book, continued, to, sell, well, into, 1844, by, the, end, of, 1844, eleven, more, editions, had, been, released, since, its, initial, publication, the, book, has, been, issued, in, numerous, hardback, and, paperback, editions, translated, into, several, languages, and, has, never, been, out, of, print, it, was, dickens, s, most, popular, book, in, the, united, states, and, sold, over, two, million, copies, in, the, hundred, years, following, its, first, publication, there, the, high, production, costs, upon, which, dickens, insisted, led, to, reduced, profits, and, the, first, edition, brought, him, only, 230, equal, to, 29, 000, in, 2024, pounds, rather, than, the, 1, 000, equal, to, 124, 000, in, 2024, pounds, he, expected, a, year, later, the, profits, were, only, 744, and, dickens, was, deeply, disappointed, according, to, douglas, fairhurst, contemporary, reviews, of, a, christmas, carol, were, almost, uniformly, kind, the, illustrated, london, news, described, how, the, story, s, impressive, eloquence, its, unfeigned, lightness, of, heart, its, playful, and, sparkling, humour, its, gentle, spirit, of, humanity, all, put, the, reader, in, good, humour, with, ourselves, with, each, other, with, the, season, and, with, the, author, the, critic, from, the, athenaeum, the, literary, magazine, considered, it, a, tale, to, make, the, reader, laugh, and, cry, to, open, his, hands, and, open, his, heart, to, charity, even, toward, the, uncharitable, a, dainty, dish, to, set, before, a, king, william, makepeace, thackeray, writing, in, fraser, s, magazine, described, the, book, as, a, national, benefit, and, to, every, man, or, woman, who, reads, it, a, personal, kindness, the, last, two, people, i, heard, speak, of, it, were, women, neither, knew, the, other, or, the, author, and, both, said, by, way, of, criticism, god, bless, him, the, poet, thomas, hood, in, his, own, journal, wrote, that, if, christmas, with, its, ancient, and, hospitable, customs, its, social, and, charitable, observances, were, ever, in, danger, of, decay, this, is, the, book, that, would, give, them, a, new, lease, the, reviewer, for, tait, s, edinburgh, magazine, theodore, martin, who, was, usually, critical, of, dickens, s, work, spoke, well, of, a, christmas, carol, noting, it, was, a, noble, book, finely, felt, and, calculated, to, work, much, social, good, after, dickens, s, death, margaret, oliphant, deplored, the, turkey, and, plum, pudding, aspects, of, the, book, but, admitted, that, in, the, days, of, its, first, publication, it, was, regarded, as, a, new, gospel, and, noted, that, the, book, was, unique, in, that, it, made, people, behave, better, the, religious, press, generally, ignored, the, tale, but, in, january, 1844, christian, remembrancer, thought, the, tale, s, old, and, hackneyed, subject, was, treated, in, an, original, way, and, praised, the, author, s, sense, of, humour, and, pathos, the, writer, and, social, thinker, john, ruskin, told, a, friend, that, he, thought, dickens, had, taken, the, religion, from, christmas, and, had, imagined, it, as,

who, went, without, turkey, and, punch, in, order, that, bob, cratchit, might, get, them, for, unless, there, were, turkeys, and, punch, in, surplus, someone, must, go, without, dickens, had, criticised, the, us, in, american, notes, and, martin, chuzzlewit, making, american, readers, reluctant, to, embrace, his, work, but, by, the, end, of, the, american, civil, war, the, book, had, gained, wide, recognition, in, american, households, in, 1863, the, new, york, times, published, an, enthusiastic, review, noting, that, the, author, brought, the, old, christmas, of, bygone, centuries, and, remote, manor, houses, into, the, living, rooms, of, the, poor, of, today, in, january, 1844, parley, s, illuminated, library, published, an, unauthorised, version, of, the, story, in, a, condensed, form, which, they, sold, for, twopence, dickens, wrote, to, his, solicitor, i, have, not, the, least, doubt, that, if, these, vagabonds, can, be, stopped, they, must, let, us, be, the, sledge, hammer, in, this, or, i, shall, be, beset, by, hundreds, of, the, same, crew, when, i, come, out, with, a, long, story, two, days, after, the, release, of, the, parley, version, dickens, sued, on, the, basis, of, copyright, infringement, and, won, the, publishers, declared, themselves, bankrupt, and, dickens, was, left, to, pay, 700, in, costs, the, small, profits, dickens, earned, from, a, christmas, carol, further, strained, his, relationship, with, his, publishers, and, he, broke, with, them, in, favour, of, bradbury, and, evans, who, had, been, printing, his, works, to, that, point, dickens, returned, to, the, tale, several, times, during, his, life, to, amend, the, phrasing, and, punctuation, he, capitalised, on, the, success, of, the, book, by, publishing, other, christmas, stories, the, chimes, 1844, the, cricket, on, the, hearth, 1845, the, battle, of, life, 1846, and, the, haunted, man, and, the, ghost, s, bargain, 1848, these, were, secular, conversion, tales, which, acknowledged, the, progressive, societal, changes, of, the, previous, year, and, highlighted, those, social, problems, which, still, needed, to, be, addressed, while, the, public, eagerly, bought, the, later, books, the, reviewers, were, highly, critical, of, the, stories, by, 1849, dickens, was, engaged, with, david, copperfield, and, had, neither, the, time, nor, the, inclination, to, produce, another, christmas, book, he, decided, the, best, way, to, reach, his, audience, with, his, carol, philosophy, was, by, public, readings, during, christmas, 1853, he, gave, a, reading, in, birmingham, town, hall, to, the, industrial, and, literary, institute, he, insisted, that, tickets, be, reserved, for, working, class, attendees, at, quarter, price, and, the, performance, was, a, great, success, thereafter, he, read, the, tale, in, an, abbreviated, version, 127, times, until, 1870, the, year, of, his, death, including, at, his, farewell, performance, in, the, years, following, the, book, s, publication, responses, to, the, tale, were, published, by, w, m, swepstone, christmas, shadows, 1850, horatio, alger, job, warner, s, christmas, 1863, louisa, may, alcott, a, christmas, dream, and, how, it, came, true, 1882, and, others, who, followed, scrooge, s, life, as, a, reformed, man, or, some, who, thought, dickens, had, got, it, wrong, and, needed, to, be, corrected, the, novella, was, adapted, for, the, stage, almost, immediately, three, productions, opened, on, 5, february, 1844, one, by, edward, stirling, a, christmas, carol, or, past, present, and, future, being, sanctioned, by, dickens, and, running, for, more, than, 40, nights, by, the, close, of, february, 1844, eight, rival, a, christmas, carol, theatrical, productions, were, playing, in, london, the, story, has, been, adapted, for, film, and, television, more, than, any, of, dickens, s, other, works, in, 1901, it, was, produced, as, scrooge, or, marley, s, ghost, a, silent, black, and, white, british, film, it, was, one, of, the, first, known, adaptations, of, a, dickens, work, on, film, but, it, is, now, largely, lost, the, story, was, adapted, in, 1923, for, bbc, radio, it, has, been, adapted, to, other, media, including, opera, ballet, animation, stage, musicals, and, a, bbc, mime, production, starring, marcel, marceau, davis, considers, the, adaptations, have, become, better, remembered, than, the, original, some, of, dickens, s, scenes, such, as, visiting, the, miners, and, lighthouse, keepers, have, been, forgotten, by, many, while, other, events, often, added, such, as, scrooge, visiting, the, cratchits, on, christmas, day, are, now, thought, by, many, to, be, part, of, the, original, story, accordingly, davis, distinguishes, between, the, original, text, and, the, remembered, version, the, phrase, merry, christmas, had, been, around, for, many, years, the, earliest, known, written, use, was, in, a, letter, in, 1534, but, dickens, s, use, of, the, phrase, in, a, christmas, carol, popularised, it, among, the, victorian, public, the, exclamation, bah, humbug, entered, popular, use, in, the, english, language, as, a, retort, to, anything, sentimental, or, overly, festive, the, name, scrooge, became, used, as, a, designation, for, a, miser, and, was, added, to, the, oxford, english, dictionary, as, such, in, 1982, in, the, early, 19th, century, the, celebration, of, christmas, was, associated, in, britain, with, the, countryside, and, peasant, revels, disconnected, to, the, increasing, urbanisation, and, industrialisation, taking, place, davis, considers, that, in, a, christmas, carol, dickens, showed, that, christmas, could, be, celebrated, in, towns, and, cities, despite, increasing, modernisation, the, modern, observance, of, christmas, in, english, speaking, countries, is, largely, the, result, of, a, victorian, era, revival, of, the, holiday, the, oxford, movement, of, the, 1830s, and, 1840s, had, produced, a, resurgence, of, the, traditional, rituals, and, religious, observances, associated, with, christmastide, and, with, a, christmas, carol, dickens, captured, the, zeitgeist, while, he, reflected, and, reinforced, his, vision, of, christmas, dickens, advocated, a, humanitarian, focus, of, the, holiday, which, influenced, several, aspects, of, christmas, that, are, still, celebrated, in, western, culture, such, as, family, gatherings, seasonal, food, and, drink, dancing, games, and, a, festive, generosity, of, spirit, the, historian, ronald, hutton, writes, that, dickens, linked, worship, and, feasting, within, a, context, of, social, reconciliation, the, novelist, william, dean, howells, analysing, several, of, dickens, s, christmas, stories, including, a, christmas, carol, considered, that, by, 1891, the, pathos, appears, false, and, strained, the, humor, largely, horseplay, the, characters, theatrical, the, joviality, pumped, the, psychology, commonplace, the, sociology, alone, funny, the, writer, james, joyce, considered, that, dickens, took, a, childish, approach, with, a, christmas, carol, producing, a, gap, between, the, na, ve, optimism, of, the, story, and, the, realities, of, life, at, the, time, ruth, glancy, the, professor, of, english, literature, states, that, the, largest, impact, of, a, christmas, carol, was, the, influence, felt, by, individual, readers, in, early, 1844, the, gentleman, s, magazine, attributed, a, rise, of, charitable, giving, in, britain, to, dickens, s, novella, in, 1874, robert, louis, stevenson, after, reading, dickens, s, christmas, books, vowed, to, give, generously, to, those, in, need, and, thomas, carlyle, expressed, a, generous, hospitality, by, hosting, two, christmas, dinners, after, reading, the, book, in, 1867, one, american, businessman, was, so, moved, by, attending, a, reading, that, he, closed, his, factory, on, christmas, day, and, sent, every, employee, a, turkey, while, in, the, early, years, of, the, 20th, century, maud, of, wales, the, queen, of, norway, sent, gifts, to, london, s, crippled, children, signed, with, tiny, tim, s, love, on, the, novella, the, author, g, k, chesterton, wrote, the, beauty, and, blessing, of, the, story, lie, in, the, great, furnace, of, real, happiness, that, glows, through, scrooge, and, everything, around, him, whether, the, christmas, visions, would, or, would, not, convert, scrooge, they, convert, us, analysing, the, changes, made, to, adaptations, over, time, davis, sees, changes, to, the, focus, of, the, story, and, its, characters, to, reflect, mainstream, thinking, of, the, period, while, dickens, s, victorian, audiences, would, have, viewed, the, tale, as, a, spiritual, but, secular, parable, in, the, early, 20th, century, it, became, a, children, s, story, read, by, parents, who, remembered, their, parents, reading, it, when, they, were, younger, in, the, lead, up, to, and, during, the, great, depression, davis, suggests, that, while, some, saw, the, story, as, a, denunciation, of, capitalism, most, read, it, as, a, way, to, escape, oppressive, economic, realities, the, film, versions, of, the, 1930s, were, different, in, the, uk, and, us, british, made, films, showed, a, traditional, telling, of, the, story, while, us, made, works, showed, cratchit, in, a, more, central, role, escaping, the, depression, caused, by, european, bankers, and, celebrating, what, davis, calls, the, christmas, of, the, common, man, in, the, 1960s, scrooge, was, sometimes, portrayed, as, a, freudian, figure, wrestling, with, his, past, by, the, 1980s, he, was,
