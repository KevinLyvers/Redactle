renaissance, music, is, traditionally, understood, to, cover, european, music, of, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, later, than, the, renaissance, era, as, it, is, understood, in, other, disciplines, rather, than, starting, from, the, early, 14th, century, ars, nova, the, trecento, music, was, treated, by, musicology, as, a, coda, to, medieval, music, and, the, new, era, dated, from, the, rise, of, triadic, harmony, and, the, spread, of, the, contenance, angloise, style, from, britain, to, the, burgundian, school, a, convenient, watershed, for, its, end, is, the, adoption, of, basso, continuo, at, the, beginning, of, the, baroque, period, the, period, may, be, roughly, subdivided, with, an, early, period, corresponding, to, the, career, of, guillaume, du, fay, c, 1397, 1474, and, the, cultivation, of, cantilena, style, a, middle, dominated, by, franco, flemish, school, and, the, four, part, textures, favored, by, johannes, ockeghem, 1410s, or, 20s, 1497, and, josquin, des, prez, late, 1450s, 1521, and, culminating, during, the, counter, reformation, in, the, florid, counterpoint, of, palestrina, c, 1525, 1594, and, the, roman, school, music, was, increasingly, freed, from, medieval, constraints, and, more, variety, was, permitted, in, range, rhythm, harmony, form, and, notation, on, the, other, hand, rules, of, counterpoint, became, more, constrained, particularly, with, regard, to, treatment, of, dissonances, in, the, renaissance, music, became, a, vehicle, for, personal, expression, composers, found, ways, to, make, vocal, music, more, expressive, of, the, texts, they, were, setting, secular, music, absorbed, techniques, from, sacred, music, and, vice, versa, popular, secular, forms, such, as, the, chanson, and, madrigal, spread, throughout, europe, courts, employed, virtuoso, performers, both, singers, and, instrumentalists, music, also, became, more, self, sufficient, with, its, availability, in, printed, form, existing, for, its, own, sake, precursor, versions, of, many, familiar, modern, instruments, including, the, violin, guitar, lute, and, keyboard, instruments, developed, into, new, forms, during, the, renaissance, these, instruments, were, modified, to, respond, to, the, evolution, of, musical, ideas, and, they, presented, new, possibilities, for, composers, and, musicians, to, explore, early, forms, of, modern, woodwind, and, brass, instruments, like, the, bassoon, and, trombone, also, appeared, extending, the, range, of, sonic, color, and, increasing, the, sound, of, instrumental, ensembles, during, the, 15th, century, the, sound, of, full, triads, became, common, and, towards, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, the, system, of, church, modes, began, to, break, down, entirely, giving, way, to, functional, tonality, the, system, in, which, songs, and, pieces, are, based, on, musical, keys, which, would, dominate, western, art, music, for, the, next, three, centuries, from, the, renaissance, era, notated, secular, and, sacred, music, survives, in, quantity, including, vocal, and, instrumental, works, and, mixed, vocal, instrumental, works, a, wide, range, of, musical, styles, and, genres, flourished, during, the, renaissance, including, masses, motets, madrigals, chansons, accompanied, songs, instrumental, dances, and, many, others, beginning, in, the, late, 20th, century, numerous, early, music, ensembles, were, formed, ensembles, specializing, in, music, of, the, renaissance, era, give, concert, tours, and, make, recordings, using, modern, reproductions, of, historical, instruments, and, using, singing, and, performing, styles, which, musicologists, believe, were, used, during, the, era, one, of, the, most, pronounced, features, of, early, renaissance, european, art, music, was, the, increasing, reliance, on, the, interval, of, the, third, and, its, inversion, the, sixth, in, the, middle, ages, thirds, and, sixths, had, been, considered, dissonances, and, only, perfect, intervals, were, treated, as, consonances, the, perfect, fourth, the, perfect, fifth, the, octave, and, the, unison, polyphony, the, use, of, multiple, independent, melodic, lines, performed, simultaneously, became, increasingly, elaborate, throughout, the, 14th, century, with, highly, independent, voices, both, in, vocal, music, and, in, instrumental, music, the, beginning, of, the, 15th, century, showed, simplification, with, the, composers, often, striving, for, smoothness, in, the, melodic, parts, this, was, possible, because, of, a, greatly, increased, vocal, range, in, music, in, the, middle, ages, the, narrow, range, made, necessary, frequent, crossing, of, parts, thus, requiring, a, greater, contrast, between, them, to, distinguish, the, different, parts, the, modal, as, opposed, to, tonal, also, known, as, musical, key, an, approach, developed, in, the, subsequent, baroque, music, era, c, 1600, 1750, characteristics, of, renaissance, music, began, to, break, down, towards, the, end, of, the, period, with, the, increased, use, of, root, motions, of, fifths, or, fourths, see, the, circle, of, fifths, for, details, an, example, of, a, chord, progression, in, which, the, chord, roots, move, by, the, interval, of, a, fourth, would, be, the, chord, progression, in, the, key, of, c, major, d, minor, g, major, c, major, these, are, all, triads, three, note, chords, the, movement, from, the, d, minor, chord, to, the, g, major, chord, is, an, interval, of, a, perfect, fourth, the, movement, from, the, g, major, chord, to, the, c, major, chord, is, also, an, interval, of, a, perfect, fourth, this, later, developed, into, one, of, the, defining, characteristics, of, tonality, during, the, baroque, era, the, main, characteristics, of, renaissance, music, are, the, development, of, polyphony, produced, the, notable, changes, in, musical, instruments, that, mark, the, renaissance, from, the, middle, ages, musically, its, use, encouraged, the, use, of, larger, ensembles, and, demanded, sets, of, instruments, that, would, blend, together, across, the, whole, vocal, range, as, in, the, other, arts, the, music, of, the, period, was, significantly, influenced, by, the, developments, which, define, the, early, modern, period, the, rise, of, humanistic, thought, the, recovery, of, the, literary, and, artistic, heritage, of, ancient, greece, and, ancient, rome, increased, innovation, and, discovery, the, growth, of, commercial, enterprises, the, rise, of, a, bourgeois, class, and, the, protestant, reformation, from, this, changing, society, emerged, a, common, unifying, musical, language, in, particular, the, polyphonic, style, of, the, franco, flemish, school, the, invention, of, the, printing, press, in, 1439, made, it, cheaper, and, easier, to, distribute, music, and, music, theory, texts, on, a, wider, geographic, scale, and, to, more, people, prior, to, the, invention, of, printing, written, music, and, music, theory, texts, had, to, be, hand, copied, a, time, consuming, and, expensive, process, demand, for, music, as, entertainment, and, as, a, leisure, activity, for, educated, amateurs, increased, with, the, emergence, of, a, bourgeois, class, dissemination, of, chansons, motets, and, masses, throughout, europe, coincided, with, the, unification, of, polyphonic, practice, into, the, fluid, style, which, culminated, in, the, second, half, of, the, sixteenth, century, in, the, work, of, composers, such, as, giovanni, pierluigi, da, palestrina, orlande, de, lassus, thomas, tallis, william, byrd, and, tom, s, luis, de, victoria, relative, political, stability, and, prosperity, in, the, low, countries, along, with, a, flourishing, system, of, music, education, in, the, area, s, many, churches, and, cathedrals, allowed, the, training, of, large, numbers, of, singers, instrumentalists, and, composers, these, musicians, were, highly, sought, throughout, europe, particularly, in, italy, where, churches, and, aristocratic, courts, hired, them, as, composers, performers, and, teachers, since, the, printing, press, made, it, easier, to, disseminate, printed, music, by, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, italy, had, absorbed, the, northern, musical, influences, with, venice, rome, and, other, cities, becoming, centers, of, musical, activity, this, reversed, the, situation, from, a, hundred, years, earlier, opera, a, dramatic, staged, genre, in, which, singers, are, accompanied, by, instruments, arose, at, this, time, in, florence, opera, was, developed, as, a, deliberate, attempt, to, resurrect, the, music, of, ancient, greece, principal, liturgical, church, based, musical, forms, which, remained, in, use, throughout, the, renaissance, period, were, masses, and, motets, with, some, other, developments, towards, the, end, of, the, era, especially, as, composers, of, sacred, music, began, to, adopt, secular, non, religious, musical, forms, such, as, the, madrigal, for, religious, use, the, 15th, and, 16th, century, masses, had, two, kinds, of, sources, that, were, used, monophonic, a, single, melody, line, and, polyphonic, multiple, independent, melodic, lines, with, two, main, forms, of, elaboration, based, on, cantus, firmus, practice, or, beginning, some, time, around, 1500, the, new, style, of, pervasive, imitation, in, which, composers, would, write, music, in, which, the, different, voices, or, parts, would, imitate, the, melodic, and, or, rhythmic, motifs, performed, by, other, voices, or, parts, several, main, types, of, masses, were, used, masses, were, normally, titled, by, the, source, from, which, they, borrowed, cantus, firmus, mass, uses, the, same, monophonic, melody, usually, drawn, from, chant, and, usually, in, the, tenor, and, most, often, in, longer, note, values, than, the, other, voices, other, sacred, genres, were, the, madrigale, spirituale, and, the, laude, during, the, period, secular, non, religious, music, had, an, increasing, distribution, with, a, wide, variety, of, forms, but, one, must, be, cautious, about, assuming, an, explosion, in, variety, since, printing, made, music, more, widely, available, much, more, has, survived, from, this, era, than, from, the, preceding, medieval, era, and, probably, a, rich, store, of, popular, music, of, the, late, middle, ages, is, lost, secular, music, was, music, that, was, independent, of, churches, the, main, types, were, the, german, lied, italian, frottola, the, french, chanson, the, italian, madrigal, and, the, spanish, villancico, other, secular, vocal, genres, included, the, caccia, rondeau, virelai, bergerette, ballade, musique, mesur, e, canzonetta, villanella, villotta, and, the, lute, song, mixed, forms, such, as, the, motet, chanson, and, the, secular, motet, also, appeared, purely, instrumental, music, included, consort, music, for, recorders, or, viols, and, other, instruments, and, dances, for, various, ensembles, common, instrumental, genres, were, the, toccata, prelude, ricercar, and, canzona, dances, played, by, instrumental, ensembles, or, sometimes, sung, included, the, basse, danse, it, bassadanza, tourdion, saltarello, pavane, galliard, allemande, courante, bransle, canarie, piva, and, lavolta, music, of, many, genres, could, be, arranged, for, a, solo, instrument, such, as, the, lute, vihuela, harp, or, keyboard, such, arrangements, were, called, intabulations, it, intavolatura, ger, intabulierung, towards, the, end, of, the, period, the, early, dramatic, precursors, of, opera, such, as, monody, the, madrigal, comedy, and, the, intermedio, are, heard, according, to, margaret, bent, renaissance, notation, is, under, prescriptive, by, our, standards, when, translated, into, modern, form, it, acquires, a, prescriptive, weight, that, overspecifies, and, distorts, its, original, openness, renaissance, compositions, were, notated, only, in, individual, parts, scores, were, extremely, rare, and, barlines, were, not, used, note, values, were, generally, larger, than, are, in, use, today, the, primary, unit, of, beat, was, the, semibreve, or, whole, note, as, had, been, the, case, since, the, ars, nova, see, medieval, music, there, could, be, either, two, or, three, of, these, for, each, breve, a, double, whole, note, which, may, be, looked, on, as, equivalent, to, the, modern, measure, though, it, was, itself, a, note, value, and, a, measure, is, not, the, situation, can, be, considered, this, way, it, is, the, same, as, the, rule, by, which, in, modern, music, a, quarter, note, may, equal, either, two, eighth, notes, or, three, which, would, be, written, as, a, triplet, by, the, same, reckoning, there, could, be, two, or, three, of, the, next, smallest, note, the, minim, equivalent, to, the, modern, half, note, to, each, semibreve, these, different, permutations, were, called, perfect, imperfect, tempus, at, the, level, of, the, breve, semibreve, relationship, perfect, imperfect, prolation, at, the, level, of, the, semibreve, minim, and, existed, in, all, possible, combinations, with, each, other, three, to, one, was, called, perfect, and, two, to, one, imperfect, rules, existed, also, whereby, single, notes, could, be, halved, or, doubled, in, value, imperfected, or, altered, respectively, when, preceded, or, followed, by, other, certain, notes, notes, with, black, noteheads, such, as, quarter, notes, occurred, less, often, this, development, of, white, mensural, notation, may, be, a, result, of, the, increased, use, of, paper, rather, than, vellum, as, the, weaker, paper, was, less, able, to, withstand, the, scratching, required, to, fill, in, solid, noteheads, notation, of, previous, times, written, on, vellum, had, been, black, other, colors, and, later, filled, in, notes, were, used, routinely, as, well, mainly, to, enforce, the, aforementioned, imperfections, or, alterations, and, to, call, for, other, temporary, rhythmical, changes, accidentals, e, g, added, sharps, flats, and, naturals, that, change, the, notes, were, not, always, specified, somewhat, as, in, certain, fingering, notations, for, guitar, family, instruments, tablatures, today, however, renaissance, musicians, would, have, been, highly, trained, in, dyadic, counterpoint, and, thus, possessed, this, and, other, information, necessary, to, read, a, score, correctly, even, if, the, accidentals, were, not, written, in, as, such, what, modern, notation, requires, would, then, have, been, perfectly, apparent, without, notation, to, a, singer, versed, in, counterpoint, see, musica, ficta, a, singer, would, interpret, his, or, her, part, by, figuring, cadential, formulas, with, other, parts, in, mind, and, when, singing, together, musicians, would, avoid, parallel, octaves, and, parallel, fifths, or, alter, their, cadential, parts, in, light, of, decisions, by, other, musicians, it, is, through, contemporary, tablatures, for, various, plucked, instruments, that, we, have, gained, much, information, about, which, accidentals, were, performed, by, the, original, practitioners, for, information, on, specific, theorists, see, johannes, tinctoris, franchinus, gaffurius, heinrich, glarean, pietro, aron, nicola, vicentino, tom, s, de, santa, mar, a, gioseffo, zarlino, vicente, lusitano, vincenzo, galilei, giovanni, artusi, johannes, nucius, and, pietro, cerone, the, key, composers, from, the, early, renaissance, era, also, wrote, in, a, late, medieval, style, and, as, such, they, are, transitional, figures, leonel, power, c, 1370s, or, 1380s, 1445, was, an, english, composer, of, the, late, medieval, and, early, renaissance, music, eras, along, with, john, dunstaple, he, was, one, of, the, major, figures, in, english, music, in, the, early, 15th, century, power, is, the, composer, best, represented, in, the, old, hall, manuscript, one, of, the, only, undamaged, sources, of, english, music, from, the, early, 15th, century, he, was, one, of, the, first, composers, to, set, separate, movements, of, the, ordinary, of, the, mass, which, were, thematically, unified, and, intended, for, contiguous, performance, the, old, hall, manuscript, contains, his, mass, based, on, the, marian, antiphon, alma, redemptoris, mater, in, which, the, antiphon, is, stated, literally, in, the, tenor, voice, in, each, movement, without, melodic, ornaments, this, is, the, only, cyclic, setting, of, the, mass, ordinary, which, can, be, attributed, to, him, he, wrote, mass, cycles, fragments, and, single, movements, and, a, variety, of, other, sacred, works, john, dunstaple, c, 1390, 1453, was, an, english, composer, of, polyphonic, music, of, the, late, medieval, era, and, early, renaissance, periods, he, was, one, of, the, most, famous, composers, active, in, the, early, 15th, century, a, near, contemporary, of, power, and, was, widely, influential, not, only, in, england, but, on, the, continent, especially, in, the, developing, style, of, the, burgundian, school, dunstaple, s, influence, on, the, continent, s, musical, vocabulary, was, enormous, particularly, considering, the, relative, paucity, of, his, attributable, works, he, was, recognized, for, possessing, something, never, heard, before, in, music, of, the, burgundian, school, la, contenance, angloise, the, english, countenance, a, term, used, by, the, poet, martin, le, franc, in, his, le, champion, des, dames, le, franc, added, that, the, style, influenced, dufay, and, binchois, writing, a, few, decades, later, in, about, 1476, the, flemish, composer, and, music, theorist, tinctoris, reaffirmed, the, powerful, influence, dunstaple, had, stressing, the, new, art, that, dunstaple, had, inspired, tinctoris, hailed, dunstaple, as, the, fons, et, origo, of, the, style, its, wellspring, and, origin, the, contenance, angloise, while, not, defined, by, martin, le, franc, was, probably, a, reference, to, dunstaple, s, stylistic, trait, of, using, full, triadic, harmony, three, note, chords, along, with, a, liking, for, the, interval, of, the, third, assuming, that, he, had, been, on, the, continent, with, the, duke, of, bedford, dunstaple, would, have, been, introduced, to, french, fauxbourdon, borrowing, some, of, the, sonorities, he, created, elegant, harmonies, in, his, own, music, using, thirds, and, sixths, an, example, of, a, third, interval, is, the, notes, c, and, e, an, example, of, a, sixth, interval, is, the, notes, c, and, a, taken, together, these, are, seen, as, defining, characteristics, of, early, renaissance, music, many, of, these, traits, may, have, originated, in, england, taking, root, in, the, burgundian, school, around, the, middle, of, the, century, because, numerous, copies, of, dunstaple, s, works, have, been, found, in, italian, and, german, manuscripts, his, fame, across, europe, must, have, been, widespread, of, the, works, attributed, to, him, only, about, fifty, survive, among, which, are, two, complete, masses, three, connected, mass, sections, fourteen, individual, mass, sections, twelve, complete, isorhythmic, motets, and, seven, settings, of, marian, antiphons, such, as, alma, redemptoris, mater, and, salve, regina, mater, misericordiae, dunstaple, was, one, of, the, first, to, compose, masses, using, a, single, melody, as, cantus, firmus, a, good, example, of, this, technique, is, his, missa, rex, seculorum, he, is, believed, to, have, written, secular, non, religious, music, but, no, songs, in, the, vernacular, can, be, attributed, to, him, with, any, degree, of, certainty, oswald, von, wolkenstein, c, 1376, 1445, is, one, of, the, most, important, composers, of, the, early, german, renaissance, he, is, best, known, for, his, well, written, melodies, and, for, his, use, of, three, themes, travel, god, and, sex, gilles, binchois, c, 1400, 1460, was, a, dutch, composer, one, of, the, earliest, members, of, the, burgundian, school, and, one, of, the, three, most, famous, composers, of, the, early, 15th, century, while, often, ranked, behind, his, contemporaries, guillaume, dufay, and, john, dunstaple, by, contemporary, scholars, his, works, were, still, cited, borrowed, and, used, as, source, material, after, his, death, binchois, is, considered, to, be, a, fine, melodist, writing, carefully, shaped, lines, which, are, easy, to, sing, and, memorable, his, tunes, appeared, in, copies, decades, after, his, death, and, were, often, used, as, sources, for, mass, composition, by, later, composers, most, of, his, music, even, his, sacred, music, is, simple, and, clear, in, outline, sometimes, even, ascetic, monk, like, a, greater, contrast, between, binchois, and, the, extreme, complexity, of, the, ars, subtilior, of, the, prior, fourteenth, century, would, be, hard, to, imagine, most, of, his, secular, songs, are, rondeaux, which, became, the, most, common, song, form, during, the, century, he, rarely, wrote, in, strophic, form, and, his, melodies, are, generally, independent, of, the, rhyme, scheme, of, the, verses, they, are, set, to, binchois, wrote, music, for, the, court, secular, songs, of, love, and, chivalry, that, met, the, expectations, and, satisfied, the, taste, of, the, dukes, of, burgundy, who, employed, him, and, evidently, loved, his, music, accordingly, about, half, of, his, extant, secular, music, is, found, in, the, oxford, bodleian, library, guillaume, du, fay, c, 1397, 1474, was, a, franco, flemish, composer, of, the, early, renaissance, the, central, figure, in, the, burgundian, school, he, was, regarded, by, his, contemporaries, as, the, leading, composer, in, europe, in, the, mid, 15th, century, du, fay, composed, in, most, of, the, common, forms, of, the, day, including, masses, motets, magnificats, hymns, simple, chant, settings, in, fauxbourdon, and, antiphons, within, the, area, of, sacred, music, and, rondeaux, ballades, virelais, and, a, few, other, chanson, types, within, the, realm, of, secular, music, none, of, his, surviving, music, is, specifically, instrumental, although, instruments, were, certainly, used, for, some, of, his, secular, music, especially, for, the, lower, parts, all, of, his, sacred, music, is, vocal, instruments, may, have, been, used, to, reinforce, the, voices, in, actual, performance, for, almost, any, of, his, works, seven, complete, masses, 28, individual, mass, movements, 15, settings, of, chant, used, in, mass, propers, three, magnificats, two, benedicamus, domino, settings, 15, antiphon, settings, six, of, them, marian, antiphons, 27, hymns, 22, motets, 13, of, these, isorhythmic, in, the, more, angular, austere, 14th, century, style, which, gave, way, to, more, melodic, sensuous, treble, dominated, part, writing, with, phrases, ending, in, the, under, third, cadence, in, du, fay, s, youth, and, 87, chansons, definitely, by, him, have, survived, many, of, du, fay, s, compositions, were, simple, settings, of, chant, obviously, designed, for, liturgical, use, probably, as, substitutes, for, the, unadorned, chant, and, can, be, seen, as, chant, harmonizations, often, the, harmonization, used, a, technique, of, parallel, writing, known, as, fauxbourdon, as, in, the, following, example, a, setting, of, the, marian, antiphon, ave, maris, stella, du, fay, may, have, been, the, first, composer, to, use, the, term, fauxbourdon, for, this, simpler, compositional, style, prominent, in, 15th, century, liturgical, music, in, general, and, that, of, the, burgundian, school, in, particular, most, of, du, fay, s, secular, non, religious, songs, follow, the, formes, fixes, rondeau, ballade, and, virelai, which, dominated, secular, european, music, of, the, 14th, and, 15th, centuries, he, also, wrote, a, handful, of, italian, ballate, almost, certainly, while, he, was, in, italy, as, is, the, case, with, his, motets, many, of, the, songs, were, written, for, specific, occasions, and, many, are, datable, thus, supplying, useful, biographical, information, most, of, his, songs, are, for, three, voices, using, a, texture, dominated, by, the, highest, voice, the, other, two, voices, unsupplied, with, text, were, probably, played, by, instruments, du, fay, was, one, of, the, last, composers, to, make, use, of, late, medieval, polyphonic, structural, techniques, such, as, isorhythm, and, one, of, the, first, to, employ, the, more, mellifluous, harmonies, phrasing, and, melodies, characteristic, of, the, early, renaissance, his, compositions, within, the, larger, genres, masses, motets, and, chansons, are, mostly, similar, to, each, other, his, renown, is, largely, due, to, what, was, perceived, as, his, perfect, control, of, the, forms, in, which, he, worked, as, well, as, his, gift, for, memorable, and, singable, melody, during, the, 15th, century, he, was, universally, regarded, as, the, greatest, composer, of, his, time, an, opinion, that, has, largely, survived, to, the, present, day, during, the, 16th, century, josquin, des, prez, c, 1450, 1455, 27, august, 1521, gradually, acquired, the, reputation, as, the, greatest, composer, of, the, age, his, mastery, of, technique, and, expression, universally, imitated, and, admired, writers, as, diverse, as, baldassare, castiglione, and, martin, luther, wrote, about, his, reputation, and, fame, in, venice, from, about, 1530, until, around, 1600, an, impressive, polychoral, style, developed, which, gave, europe, some, of, the, grandest, most, sonorous, music, composed, up, until, that, time, with, multiple, choirs, of, singers, brass, and, strings, in, different, spatial, locations, in, the, basilica, san, marco, di, venezia, see, venetian, school, these, multiple, revolutions, spread, over, europe, in, the, next, several, decades, beginning, in, germany, and, then, moving, to, spain, france, and, england, somewhat, later, demarcating, the, beginning, of, what, we, now, know, as, the, baroque, musical, era, the, roman, school, was, a, group, of, composers, of, predominantly, church, music, in, rome, spanning, the, late, renaissance, and, early, baroque, eras, many, of, the, composers, had, a, direct, connection, to, the, vatican, and, the, papal, chapel, though, they, worked, at, several, churches, stylistically, they, are, often, contrasted, with, the, venetian, school, of, composers, a, concurrent, movement, which, was, much, more, progressive, by, far, the, most, famous, composer, of, the, roman, school, is, giovanni, pierluigi, da, palestrina, while, best, known, as, a, prolific, composer, of, masses, and, motets, he, was, also, an, important, madrigalist, his, ability, to, bring, together, the, functional, needs, of, the, catholic, church, with, the, prevailing, musical, styles, during, the, counter, reformation, period, gave, him, his, enduring, fame, the, brief, but, intense, flowering, of, the, musical, madrigal, in, england, mostly, from, 1588, to, 1627, along, with, the, composers, who, produced, them, is, known, as, the, english, madrigal, school, the, english, madrigals, were, a, cappella, predominantly, light, in, style, and, generally, began, as, either, copies, or, direct, translations, of, italian, models, most, were, for, three, to, six, voices, musica, reservata, is, either, a, style, or, a, performance, practice, in, a, cappella, vocal, music, of, the, latter, half, of, the, 16th, century, mainly, in, italy, and, southern, germany, involving, refinement, exclusivity, and, intense, emotional, expression, of, sung, text, the, cultivation, of, european, music, in, the, americas, began, in, the, 16th, century, soon, after, the, arrival, of, the, spanish, and, the, conquest, of, mexico, although, fashioned, in, european, style, uniquely, mexican, hybrid, works, based, on, native, mexican, language, and, european, musical, practice, appeared, very, early, musical, practices, in, new, spain, continually, coincided, with, european, tendencies, throughout, the, subsequent, baroque, and, classical, music, periods, among, these, new, world, composers, were, hernando, franco, antonio, de, salazar, and, manuel, de, zumaya, in, addition, writers, since, 1932, have, observed, what, they, call, a, seconda, prattica, an, innovative, practice, involving, monodic, style, and, freedom, in, treatment, of, dissonance, both, justified, by, the, expressive, setting, of, texts, during, the, late, 16th, and, early, 17th, centuries, in, the, late, 16th, century, as, the, renaissance, era, closed, an, extremely, manneristic, style, developed, in, secular, music, especially, in, the, madrigal, there, was, a, trend, towards, complexity, and, even, extreme, chromaticism, as, exemplified, in, madrigals, of, luzzaschi, marenzio, and, gesualdo, the, term, mannerism, derives, from, art, history, beginning, in, florence, there, was, an, attempt, to, revive, the, dramatic, and, musical, forms, of, ancient, greece, through, the, means, of, monody, a, form, of, declaimed, music, over, a, simple, accompaniment, a, more, extreme, contrast, with, the, preceding, polyphonic, style, would, be, hard, to, find, this, was, also, at, least, at, the, outset, a, secular, trend, these, musicians, were, known, as, the, florentine, camerata, we, have, already, noted, some, of, the, musical, developments, that, helped, to, usher, in, the, baroque, but, for, further, explanation, of, this, transition, see, antiphon, concertato, monody, madrigal, and, opera, as, well, as, the, works, given, under, sources, and, further, reading, many, instruments, originated, during, the, renaissance, others, were, variations, of, or, improvements, upon, instruments, that, had, existed, previously, some, have, survived, to, the, present, day, others, have, disappeared, only, to, be, recreated, in, order, to, perform, music, of, the, period, on, authentic, instruments, as, in, the, modern, day, instruments, may, be, classified, as, brass, strings, percussion, and, woodwind, medieval, instruments, in, europe, had, most, commonly, been, used, singly, often, self, accompanied, with, a, drone, or, occasionally, in, parts, from, at, least, as, early, as, the, 13th, century, through, the, 15th, century, there, was, a, division, of, instruments, into, haut, loud, shrill, outdoor, instruments, and, bas, quieter, more, intimate, instruments, only, two, groups, of, instruments, could, play, freely, in, both, types, of, ensembles, the, cornett, and, sackbut, and, the, tabor, and, tambourine, at, the, beginning, of, the, 16th, century, instruments, were, considered, to, be, less, important, than, voices, they, were, used, for, dances, and, to, accompany, vocal, music, instrumental, music, remained, subordinated, to, vocal, music, and, much, of, its, repertory, was, in, varying, ways, derived, from, or, dependent, on, vocal, models, various, kinds, of, organs, were, commonly, used, in, the, renaissance, from, large, church, organs, to, small, portatives, and, reed, organs, called, regals, brass, instruments, in, the, renaissance, were, traditionally, played, by, professionals, some, of, the, more, common, brass, instruments, that, were, played, as, a, family, strings, were, used, in, many, circumstances, both, sacred, and, secular, a, few, members, of, this, family, include, some, renaissance, percussion, instruments, include, the, triangle, the, jew, s, harp, the, tambourine, the, bells, cymbals, the, rumble, pot, and, various, kinds, of, drums, woodwind, instruments, aerophones, produce, sound, by, means, of, a, vibrating, column, of, air, within, the, pipe, holes, along, the, pipe, allow, the, player, to, control, the, length, of, the, column, of, air, and, hence, the, pitch, there, are, several, ways, of, making, the, air, column, vibrate, and, these, ways, define, the, subcategories, of, woodwind, instruments, a, player, may, blow, across, a, mouth, hole, as, in, a, flute, into, a, mouthpiece, with, a, single, reed, as, in, a, modern, day, clarinet, or, saxophone, or, a, double, reed, as, in, an, oboe, or, bassoon, all, three, of, these, methods, of, tone, production, can, be, found, in, renaissance, instruments
