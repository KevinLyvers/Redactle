fantasy, genre, predominantly, features, settings, that, emulate, earth, but, with, a, sense, of, otherness, in, its, broadest, sense, however, fantasy, consists, of, works, by, many, writers, artists, filmmakers, and, musicians, from, ancient, myths, and, legends, to, many, recent, and, popular, works, many, works, of, fantasy, use, magic, or, other, supernatural, elements, as, a, main, plot, element, theme, or, setting, magic, magic, practitioners, sorcerers, witches, and, so, on, and, magical, creatures, are, common, in, many, of, these, worlds, an, identifying, trait, of, fantasy,

to, attend, to, the, history, and, natural, laws, of, reality, where, fantasy, does, not, in, writing, fantasy, the, author, uses, worldbuilding, to, create, characters, situations, and, settings, that, may, not, be, possible, in, reality, many, fantasy, authors, use, real, world, folklore, and, mythology, as, inspiration, and, although, another, defining, characteristic, of, the, fantasy, genre, is, the, inclusion, of, supernatural, elements, such, as, magic, this, does, not, have, to, be, the, case, fantasy, has, often, been, compared, to, science, fiction, and, horror, because, they, are, the, major, categories, of, speculative, fiction, fantasy, is, distinguished, from, science, fiction, by, the, plausibility, of, the, narrative, elements, a, science, fiction, narrative, is, unlikely, though, seemingly, possible, through, logical, scientific, or, technological, extrapolation, where, fantasy, narratives, do, not, need, to, be, scientifically, possible, authors, have, to, rely, on, the, readers, suspension, of, disbelief, an, acceptance, of, the, unbelievable, or, impossible, for, the, sake, of, enjoyment, in, order, to, write, effective, fantasies, despite, both, genres, heavy, reliance, on, the, supernatural, fantasy, and, horror, are, distinguishable, from, one, another, horror, primarily, evokes, fear, through, the, protagonists, weaknesses, or, inability, to, deal, with, the, antagonists, while, some, elements, of, the, supernatural, and, the, fantastic, were, a, part, of, literature, from, its, beginning, fantasy, elements, occur, throughout, ancient, religious, texts, such, as, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, the, ancient, babylonian, creation, epic, the, en, ma, eli, in, which, the, god, marduk, slays, the, goddess, tiamat, contains, the, theme, of, a,

court, of, king, khufu, which, is, preserved, in, the, westcar, papyrus, and, was, probably, written, in, the, middle, of, the, second, half, of, the, eighteenth, century, bc, preserves, a, mixture, of, stories, with, elements, of, historical, fiction, fantasy, and, satire, egyptian, funerary, texts, preserve, mythological, tales, the, most, significant, of, which, are, the, myths, of, osiris, and, his, son, horus, myth, with, fantastic, elements, intended, for, adults, were, a, major, genre, of, ancient, greek, literature, the, comedies, of, aristophanes, are, filled, with, fantastic, elements, particularly, his, play, the, birds, in, which, an, athenian, man, builds, a, city, in, the, clouds, with, the, birds, and, challenges, zeus, s, authority, ovid, s, metamorphoses, and, apuleius, s, the, golden, ass, are, both, works, that, influenced, the, development, of, the, fantasy, genre, by, taking, mythic, elements, and, weaving, them, into, personal, accounts, both, works, involve, complex, narratives, in, which, humans, beings, are, transformed, into, animals, or, inanimate, objects, platonic, teachings, and, early, christian, theology, are, major, influences, on, the, modern, fantasy, genre, plato, used, allegories, to, convey, many, of, his, teachings, and, early, christian, writers, interpreted, both, the, old, and, new, testaments, as, employing, parables, to, relay, spiritual, truths, this, ability, to, find, meaning, in, a, story, that, is, not, literally, true, became, the, foundation, that, allowed, the, modern, fantasy, genre, to, develop, the, most, well, known, fiction, from, the, islamic, world, is, one, thousand, and, one, nights, arabian, nights, which, is, a, compilation, of, many, ancient, and, medieval, folk, tales, various, characters, from, this, epic, have, become, cultural, icons, in, western, culture, such, as, aladdin, sinbad, and, ali, baba, hindu, mythology, was, an, evolution, of, the, earlier, vedic, mythology, and, had, many, more, fantastical, stories, and, characters, particularly, in, the, indian, epics, the, panchatantra, fables, of, bidpai, for, example, used, various, animal, fables, and, magical, tales, to, illustrate, the, central, indian, principles, of, political, science, chinese, traditions, have, been, particularly, influential, in, the, vein, of, fantasy, known, as, chinoiserie, including, such, writers, as, ernest, bramah, and, barry, hughart, beowulf, is, among, the, best, known, of, the, old, english, tales, in, the, english, speaking, world, and, has, had, deep, influence, on, the, fantasy, genre, several, fantasy, works, have, retold, the, tale, such, as, john, gardner, s, grendel, norse, mythology, as, found, in, the, elder, edda, and, the, younger, edda, includes, such, figures, as, odin, and, his, fellow, aesir, and, dwarves, elves, dragons, and, giants, these, elements, have, been, directly, imported, into, various, fantasy, works, the, separate, folklore, of, ireland, wales, and, scotland, has, sometimes, been, used, indiscriminately, for, celtic, fantasy, sometimes, with, great, effect, other, writers, have, specified, the, use, of, a, single, source, the, welsh, tradition, has, been, particularly, influential, due, to, its, connection, to, king, arthur, and, its, collection, in, a, single, work, the, epic, mabinogion, there, are, many, works, where, the, boundary, between, fantasy, and, other, works, is, not, clear, the, question, of, whether, the, writers, believed, in, the, possibilities, of, the, marvels, in, a, midsummer, night, s, dream, or, sir, gawain, and, the, green, knight, makes, it, difficult, to, distinguish, when, fantasy, in, its, modern, sense, first, began, although, pre, dated, by, john, ruskin, s, the, king, of, the, golden, river, 1841, the, history, of, modern, fantasy, literature, is, usually, said, to, begin, with, george, macdonald, the, scottish, author, of, such, novels, as, phantastes, 1858, and, the, princess, and, the, goblin, 1872, the, former, is, widely, considered, to, be, the, first, fantasy, novel, ever, written, for, adults, macdonald, was, a, major, influence, on, both, j, r, r, tolkien, and, c, s, lewis, the, other, major, fantasy, author, of, this, era, was, william, morris, an, english, poet, who, wrote, several, novels, in, the, latter, part, of, the, century, including, the, wood, beyond, the, world, 1894, and, the, well, at, the, world, s, end, 1896, despite, macdonald, s, future, influence, with, at, the, back, of, the, north, wind, 1871, morris, s, popularity, with, his, contemporaries, and, h, g, wells, s, the, wonderful, visit, 1895, it, was, not, until, the, 20th, century, that, fantasy, fiction, began, to, reach, a, large, audience, lord, dunsany, established, the, genre, s, popularity, in, both, the, novel, and, the, short, story, form, h, rider, haggard, rudyard, kipling, and, edgar, rice, burroughs, began, to, write, fantasy, at, this, time, these, authors, along, with, abraham, merritt, established, what, was, known, as, the, lost, world, subgenre, which, was, the, most, popular, form, of, fantasy, in, the, early, decades, of, the, 20th, century, although, several, classic, children, s, fantasies, such, as, peter, pan, and, the, wonderful, wizard, of, oz, were, also, published, around, this, time, juvenile, fantasy, was, considered, more, acceptable, than, fantasy, intended, for, adults, with, the, effect, that, writers, who, wished, to, write, fantasy, had, to, fit, their, work, into, forms, aimed, at, children, nathaniel, hawthorne, wrote, fantasy, in, a, wonder, book, for, girls, and, boys, intended, for, children, although, his, works, for, adults, only, verged, on, fantasy, for, many, years, this, and, successes, such, as, alice, s, adventures, in, wonderland, 1865, created, the, circular, effect, that, all, fantasy, works, even, the, later, the, lord, of, the, rings, were, therefore, classified, as, children,

superstitious, and, backward, products, of, a, feudal, society, hindering, the, modernization, of, china, stories, of, the, supernatural, continued, to, be, denounced, once, the, communists, rose, to, power, and, mainland, china, experienced, a, revival, in, fantasy, only, after, the, cultural, revolution, had, ended, fantasy, became, a, genre, of, pulp, magazines, published, in, the, west, in,

57, are, women, and, 43, are, men, fantasy, is, studied, in, a, number, of, disciplines, including, english, and, other, language, studies, cultural, studies, comparative, literature, history, and, medieval, studies, some, works, make, political, historical, and, literary, connections, between, medievalism, and, popular, culture, french, literature, theorists, as, tzvetan, todorov, argues, that, the, fantastic, is, a, liminal, space, characterized, by, the, intrusion, of, supernatural, elements, into, the, realistic, framework, of, a, story, accompanied, by, uncertainty, about, their, existence, however, this, precise, definition, is, not, the, predominant, one, in, english, critical, literature, and, the, french, term, fantastique, is, used, to, differentiate, the, french, concept, from, the, broader, english, term, of, fantastic, synonym, of, fantasy, the, restrictive, definition, of, todorov, and, the, difference, of, critical, traditions, of, each, country, have, led, to, controversies, such, as, the, one, led, by, stanislaw, lem, rosemary, jackson, builds, onto, and, challenges, as, well, todorov, s, definition, of, the, fantastic, in, her, 1981, nonfiction, book, fantasy, the, literature, of, subversion, jackson, rejects, the, notion, of, the, fantastic, genre, as, a, simple, vessel, for, wish, fulfillment, that, transcends, human, reality, in, worlds, presented, as, superior, to, our, own, instead, positing, that, the, genre, is, inseparable, from, real, life, particularly, the, social, and, cultural, contexts, within, which, each, work, of, the, fantastic, is, produced, she, writes, that, the, unreal, elements, of, fantastic, literature, are, created, only, in, direct, contrast, to, the, boundaries, set, by, its, time, period, s, cultural, order, acting, to, illuminate, the, unseen, limitations, of, said, boundaries, by, undoing, and, recompiling, the, very, structures, which, define, society, into, something, strange, and, apparently, new, in, subverting, these, societal, norms, jackson, claims, the, fantastic, represents, the, unspoken, desire, for, greater, societal, change, jackson, criticizes, todorov, s, theory, as, being, too, limited, in, scope, examining, only, the, literary, function, of, the, fantastic, and, expands, his, structuralist, theory, to, fit, a, more, cultural, study, of, the, genre, which, incidentally, she, proposes, is, not, a, genre, at, all, but, a, mode, that, draws, upon, literary, elements, of, both, realistic, and, supernatural, fiction, to, create, the, air, of, uncertainty, in, its, narratives, as, described, by, todorov, jackson, also, introduces, the, idea, of, reading, the, fantastic, through, a, psychoanalytical, lens, referring, primarily, to, freud, s, theory, of, the, unconscious, which, she, believes, is, integral, to, understanding, the, fantastic, s, connection, to, the, human, psyche, there, are, however, additional, ways, to, view, the, fantastic, and, often, these, differing, perspectives, come, from, differing, social, climates, in, their, introduction, to, the, female, fantastic, gender, and, the, supernatural, in, the, 1890s, and, 1920s, lizzie, harris, mccormick, jennifer, mitchell, and, rebecca, soares, describe, how, the, social, climate, in, the, 1890s, and, 1920s, allowed, for, a, new, era, of, fantastic, literature, to, grow, women, were, finally, exploring, the, new, freedoms, given, to, them, and, were, quickly, becoming, equals, in, society, the, fear, of, the, new, women, in, society, paired, with, their, growing, roles, allowed, them, to, create, a, new, style, of, fuzzy, supernatural, texts, the, fantastic, is, on, the, dividing, line, between, supernatural, and, not, supernatural, just, as, during, this, time, period, the, women, were, not, respecting, the, boundary, of, inequality, that, had, always, been, set, for, them, at, the, time, women, s, roles, in, society, were, very, uncertain, just, as, the, rules, of, the, fantastic, are, never, straightforward, this, climate, allowed, for, a, genre, similar, to, the, social, structure, to, emerge, the, fantastic, is, never, purely, supernatural, nor, can, the, supernatural, be, ruled, out, just, as, women, were, not, equal, yet, but, they, were, not, completely, oppressed, the, female, fantastic, seeks, to, enforce, this, idea, that, nothing, is, certain, in, the, fantastic, nor, the, gender, roles, of, the, 1920s, many, women, in, this, time, period, began, to, blur, the, lines, between, the, genders, removing, the, binary, out, of, gender, and, allowing, for, many, interpretations, for, the, first, time, women, started, to, possess, more, masculine, or, queer, qualities, without, it, becoming, as, much, of, an, issue, the, fantastic, during, this, time, period, reflects, these, new, ideas, by, breaking, parallel, boundaries, in, the, supernatural, the, fantastic, breaks, this, boundary, by, having, the, readers, never, truly, know, whether, or, not, the, story, is, supernatural
