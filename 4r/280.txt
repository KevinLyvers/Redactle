fails, him, he, flees, and, is, chased, by, achilles, around, the, city, finally, athena, tricks, him, into, stopping, and, he, turns, to, face, his, opponent, after, a, brief, duel, achilles, stabs, hector, through, the, neck, before, dying, hector, reminds, achilles, that, he, too, is, fated, to, die, achilles, strips, hector, of, his, own, armor, gloating, over, his, death, achilles, then,

hector, s, body, after, a, meal, priam, carries, hector, s, body, back, into, troy, hector, is, buried, and, the, city, mourns, ancient, greek, religion, had, no, founder, and, was, not, the, creation, of, an, inspired, teacher, rather, the, religion, arose, out, of, the, diverse, beliefs, of, the, greek, people, these, beliefs, coincide, to, the, thoughts, about, the, gods, in, polytheistic, greek, religion, adkins, and, pollard, 2020, 1998, agree, with, this, by, saying, the, early, greeks, personalized, every, aspect, of, their, world, natural, and, cultural, and, their, experiences, in, it, the, earth, the, sea, the, mountains, the, rivers, custom, law, themis, and, one, s, share, in, society, and, its, goods, were, all, seen, in, personal, as, well, as, naturalistic, terms, as, a, result, of, this, thinking, each, god, or, goddess, in, polytheistic, greek, religion, is, attributed, to, an, aspect, of, the, human, world, for, example, poseidon, is, the, god, of, the, sea, aphrodite, is, the, goddess, of, beauty, ares, is, the, god, of, war, and, so, on, and, so, forth, for, many, other, gods, this, is, how, greek, culture, was, defined, as, many, athenians, felt, the, presence, of, their, gods, through, divine, intervention, in, significant, events, in, their, lives, oftentimes, they, found, these, events, to, be, mysterious, and, inexplicable, in, the, literary, trojan, war, of, the, iliad, the, olympian, gods, goddesses, and, minor, deities, fight, among, themselves, and, participate, in, human, warfare, often, by, interfering, with, humans, to, counter, other, gods, unlike, their, portrayals, in, greek, religion, homer, s, portrayal, of, gods, suits, his, narrative, purpose, the, gods, in, traditional, thought, of, 4th, century, athenians, were, not, spoken, of, in, terms, familiar, to, the, works, of, homer, the, classical, era, historian, herodotus, says, that, homer, and, hesiod, his, contemporary, were, the, first, writers, to, name, and, describe, the, gods, appearance, and, character, mary, lefkowitz, 2003, discusses, the, relevance, of, divine, action, in, the, iliad, attempting, to, answer, the, question, of, whether, divine, intervention, is, a, discrete, occurrence, for, its, own, sake, or, if, such, godly, behaviors, are, mere, human, character, metaphors, the, intellectual, interest, of, classic, era, authors, such, as, thucydides, and, plato, was, limited, to, their, utility, as, a, way, of, talking, about, human, life, rather, than, a, description, or, a, truth, because, if, the, gods, remain, religious, figures, rather, than, human, metaphors, their, existence, without, the, foundation, of, either, dogma, or, a, bible, of, faiths, then, allowed, greek, culture, the, intellectual, breadth, and, freedom, to, conjure, gods, fitting, any, religious, function, they, required, as, a, people, psychologist, julian, jaynes, 1976, uses, the, iliad, as, a, major, piece, of, evidence, for, his, theory, of, the, bicameral, mind, which, posits, that, until, about, the, time, described, in, the, iliad, humans, had, a, far, different, mentality, from, present, day, humans, he, says, that, humans, during, that, time, were, lacking, what, is, today, called, consciousness, he, suggests, that, humans, heard, and, obeyed, commands, from, what, they, identified, as, gods, until, the, change, in, human, mentality, that, incorporated, the, motivating, force, into, the, conscious, self, he, points, out, that, almost, every, action, in, the, iliad, is, directed, caused, or, influenced, by, a, god, and, that, earlier, translations, show, an, astonishing, lack, of, words, suggesting, thought, planning, or, introspection, those, that, do, appear, he, argues, are, misinterpretations, made, by, translators, imposing, a, modern, mentality, on, the, characters, a, form, of, reverse, logic, by, which, a, conclusion, determines, the, validity, of, evidence, some, scholars, believe, that, the, gods, may, have, intervened, in, the, mortal, world, because, of, quarrels, they, may, have, had, with, each, other, homer, interprets, the, world, at, this, time, by, using, the, passion, and, emotion, of, the, gods, to, be, determining, factors, of, what, happens, on, the, human, level, an, example, of, one, of, these, relationships, in, the, iliad, occurs, between, athena, hera, and, aphrodite, in, the, final, book, of, the, poem, homer, writes, he, offended, athena, and, hera, both, goddesses, athena, and, hera, are, envious, of, aphrodite, because, of, a, beauty, pageant, on, mount, olympus, in, which, paris, chose, aphrodite, to, be, the, most, beautiful, goddess, over, both, hera, and, athena, wolfgang, kullmann, further, goes, on, to, say, hera, s, and, athena, s, disappointment, over, the, victory, of, aphrodite, in, the, judgement, of, paris, determines, the, whole, conduct, of, both, goddesses, in, the, iliad, and, is, the, cause, of, their, hatred, for, paris, the, judge, and, his, town, troy, hera, and, athena, then, continue, to, support, the, achaean, forces, throughout, the, poem, because, paris, is, part, of, the, trojans, while, aphrodite, aids, paris, and, the, trojans, the, emotions, between, the, goddesses, often, translate, to, actions, they, take, in, the, mortal, world, for, example, in, book, 3, of, the, iliad, paris, challenges, any, of, the, achaeans, to, a, single, combat, and, menelaus, steps, forward, menelaus, is, dominating, the, battle, and, is, on, the, verge, of, killing, paris, now, he, d, have, hauled, him, off, and, won, undying, glory, but, aphrodite, zeus, s, daughter, was, quick, to, the, mark, snapped, the, rawhide, strap, aphrodite, intervenes, out, of, her, own, self, interest, to, save, paris, from, the, wrath, of, menelaus, because, paris, had, helped, her, to, win, the, beauty, pageant, the, partisanship, of, aphrodite, towards, paris, induces, constant, intervention, by, all, of, the, gods, especially, to, give, motivational, speeches, to, their, respective, prot, g, s, while, often, appearing, in, the, shape, of, a, human, being, they, are, familiar, with, this, connection, of, emotions, to, actions, is, just, one, example, out, of, many, that, occur, throughout, the, poem, fate, k, r, fated, death, propels, most, of, the, events, of, the, iliad, once, set, gods, and, men, abide, it, neither, truly, able, nor, willing, to, contest, it, how, fate, is, set, is, unknown, but, it, is, told, by, the, fates, and, by, zeus, through, sending, omens, to, seers, such, as, calchas, men, and, their, gods, continually, speak, of, heroic, acceptance, and, cowardly, avoidance, of, one, s, slated, fate, fate, does, not, determine, every, action, incident, and, occurrence, but, it, does, determine, the, outcome, of, life, before, killing, him, hector, calls, patroclus, a, fool, for, cowardly, avoidance, of, his, fate, by, attempting, his, defeat, patroclus, retorts, no, deadly, destiny, with, the, son, of, leto, has, killed, me, and, of, men, it, was, euphorbos, you, are, only, my, third, slayer, and, put, away, in, your, heart, this, other, thing, that, i, tell, you, you, yourself, are, not, one, who, shall, live, long, but, now, already, death, and, powerful, destiny, are, standing, beside, you, to, go, down, under, the, hands, of, aiakos, great, son, achilleus, here, patroclus, alludes, to, his, fated, death, by, hector, s, hand, and, to, hector, s, fated, death, by, achilles, s, hand, each, accepts, the, outcome, of, his, life, yet, no, one, knows, if, the, gods, can, alter, fate, the, first, instance, of, this, doubt, occurs, in, book, xvi, seeing, patroclus, about, to, kill, sarpedon, his, mortal, son, zeus, says, ah, me, that, it, is, destined, that, the, dearest, of, men, sarpedon, must, go, down, under, the, hands, of, menoitios, son, patroclus, about, his, dilemma, hera, asks, zeus, majesty, son, of,

sets, forth, a, chain, of, events, that, leads, him, to, take, from, achilles, briseis, the, girl, he, had, originally, given, achilles, in, return, for, his, martial, prowess, due, to, this, slight, achilles, refuses, to, fight, and, asks, his, mother, thetis, to, make, sure, that, zeus, causes, the, achaeans, to, suffer, on, the, battlefield, until, agamemnon, comes, to, realize, the, harm, he, has, done, to, him, achilles, s, pride, allows, him, to, beg, thetis, for, the, deaths, of, his, achaean, friends, when, in, book, 9, his, friends, urge, him, to, return, offering, him, loot, and, his, girl, briseis, he, refuses, stuck, in, his, vengeful, pride, achilles, remains, stuck, until, the, very, end, when, his, anger, at, himself, for, patroclus, s, death, overcomes, his, pride, at,

patroclus, etc, though, the, traditional, concept, of, heroism, is, often, tied, directly, to, the, protagonist, who, is, meant, to, be, written, in, a, heroic, light, the, iliad, plays, with, this, idea, of, heroism, and, does, not, make, it, explicitly, clear, who, the, true, hero, of, the, story, is, the, story, of, the, iliad, follows, the, great, greek, warrior, achilles, as, well, as, his, rage, and, the, destruction, it, causes, parallel, to, this, the, story, also, follows, the, trojan, warrior, hector, and, his, efforts, to, fight, to, protect, his, family, and, his, people, it, is, generally, assumed, that, because, he, is, the, protagonist, achilles, is, the, hero, of, this, story, examining, his, actions, throughout, the, iliad, and, comparing, them, to, those, of, other, characters, however, some, may, come, to, the, conclusion, that, achilles, is, not, really, the, hero, and, perhaps, even, an, antihero, it, can, also, be, argued, that, hector, is, the, true, hero, of, the, iliad, due, to, his, inherently, heroic, qualities, such, as, his, loyalty, to, his, family, and, strength, and, determination, to, defend, his, people, and, the, focus, at, the, end, of, the, story, on, burying, hector, with, honor, the, true, hero, of, the, iliad, is, never, shown, explicitly, and, is, purposefully, left, up, to, interpretation, by, the, author, homer, who, aimed, to, show, the, complexity, and, flaws, of, both, characters, regardless, of, who, is, considered, the, true, hero, akin, to, kleos, is, tim, respect, honor, the, concept, denoting, the,

convoked, meeting, between, the, greek, kings, and, the, seer, calchas, king, agamemnon, dishonours, chryses, the, trojan, priest, of, apollo, by, refusing, with, a, threat, the, restitution, of, his, daughter, chryseis, despite, the, proffered, ransom, of, gifts, beyond, count, the, insulted, priest, prays, to, apollo, for, help, and, a, nine, day, rain, of, divine, plague, arrows, falls, upon, the, achaeans, moreover, in, that, meeting, achilles, accuses, agamemnon, of, being, greediest, for, gain, of, all, men, to, that, agamemnon, replies, but, here, is, my, threat, to, you, even, as, phoibos, apollo, is, taking, away, my, chryseis, i, shall, convey, her, back, in, my, own, ship, with, my, own, followers, but, i, shall, take, the, fair, cheeked, briseis, your, prize, i, myself,

that, only, athena, stays, achilles, s, wrath, he, vows, to, never, again, obey, orders, from, agamemnon, furious, achilles, cries, to, his, mother, thetis, who, persuades, zeus, s, divine,

the, peaceful, aspects, of, war, the, first, instance, of, this, is, in, book, 3, when, menelaus, and, paris, agree, to, fight, one, one, on, one, to, end, the, war, this, conversation, between, menelaus, and, paris, highlights, the, overwhelming, desire, for, peace, on, both, sides, also, in, book, 3, we, see, peace, when, the, elders, talk, to, priam, saying, that, though, helen, is, a, beautiful, woman, war, is, still, too, high, a, price, to, pay, for, one, person, these, events, display, the, humanity, of, the, war, in, book, 6, when, hector, goes, back, into, the, city, to, visit, his, family, this, event, is, another, powerful, show, of, peace, because, we, get, to, see, that, hector, is, more, than, a, great, warrior, he, is, a, loving, father, and, devoted, husband, the, love, that, is, shared, between, him, and, his, family, contrasts, with, the, gory, battle, scenes, noting, the, importance, of, peace, the, final, moments, of, peace, are, in, books, 23, and, 24, the, first, of, these, is, the, funeral, games, that, are, held, for, patroclus, the, games, show, the, happiness, grief, and, joy, that, can, happen, during, the, war, in, book, 24, peace, is, highlighted, again, when, achilles, and, priam, share, food, and, grief, for, their, recent, losses, in, this, encounter, the, two, empathize, with, one, another, and, agree, to, a, truce, of, twelve, days, for, the, burial, of, hector, the, poem, dates, to, the, archaic, period, of, classical, antiquity, scholarly, consensus, mostly, places, it, in, the, late, 8th, century, bc, although, some, favour, a, 7th, century, date, in, any, case, the, terminus, ante, quem, for, the, dating, of, the, iliad, is, 630, bc, as, evidenced, by, reflection, in, art, and, literature, herodotus, having, consulted, the, oracle, at, dodona, placed, homer, and, hesiod, at, approximately, 400, years, before, his, own, time, which, would, place, them, at, c, 850, bc, the, historical, backdrop, of, the, poem, is, the, time, of, the, late, bronze, age, collapse, in, the, early, 12th, century, bc, homer, is, thus, separated, from, his, subject, matter, by, about, 400, years, the, period, known, as, the, greek, dark, ages, intense, scholarly, debate, has, surrounded, the, question, of, which, portions, of, the, poem, preserve, genuine, traditions, from, the, mycenaean, period, the, catalogue, of, ships, in, particular, has, the, striking, feature, that, its, geography, does, not, portray, greece, in, the, iron, age, the, time, of, homer, but, as, it, was, before, the, dorian, invasion, the, title, ilias, gen, is, an, ellipsis, of, meaning, the, trojan, poem, is, the, specifically, feminine, adjective, form, from, the, masculine, adjective, form, would, be, or, it, is, used, by, herodotus, venetus, a, copied, in, the, 10th, century, ad, is, the, oldest, fully, extant, manuscript, of, the, iliad, it, contains, the, text, of, the, iliad, as, well, as, annotations, glosses, and, commentaries, the, a, scholia, venetus, a, may, be, the, work, of, aristophanes, of, byzantium, of, the, library, of, alexandria, this, is, the, oldest, existing, manuscript, of, homer, s, iliad, it, is, regarded, as, the, best, text, of, the, iliad, biblioteca, marciana, in, venice, as, codex, marcianus, graecus, 454, now, 822, the, first, edition, of, the, iliad, editio, princeps, was, edited,

bases, of, pedagogy, literature, was, central, to, the, educational, cultural, function, of, the, itinerant, rhapsode, who, composed, consistent, epic, poems, from, memory, and, improvisation, and, disseminated, them, via, song, and, chant, in, his, travels, and, at, the, panathenaic, festival, of, athletics, music, poetics, and, sacrifice, celebrating, athena, s, birthday, originally, classical, scholars, treated, the, iliad, and, the, odyssey, as, written, poetry, and, homer, as, a, writer, yet, by, the, 1920s, milman, parry, 1902, 1935, had, launched, a, movement, claiming, otherwise, his, investigation, of, the, oral, homeric, style, stock, epithets, and, reiteration, words, phrases, stanzas, established, that, these, formulae, were, artifacts, of, oral, tradition, easily, applied, to, a, hexametric, line, a, two, word, stock, epithet, e, g, resourceful, odysseus, reiteration, may, complement, a, character, name, by, filling, a, half, line, thus, freeing, the, poet, to, compose, a, half, line, of, original, formulaic, text, to, complete, his, meaning, in, yugoslavia, parry, and, his, assistant, albert, lord, 1912, 1991, studied, the, oral, formulaic, composition, of, serbian, oral, poetry, yielding, the, parry, lord, thesis, that, established, oral, tradition, studies, later, developed, by, eric, havelock, marshall, mcluhan, walter, ong, and, gregory, nagy, in, the, singer, of, tales, 1960, lord, presents, likenesses, between, the, tragedies, of, the, achaean, patroclus, in, the, iliad, and, the, sumerian, enkidu, in, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, and, claims, to, refute, with, careful, analysis, of, the, repetition, of, thematic, patterns, that, the, patroclus, storyline, upsets, homer, s, established, compositional, formulae, of, wrath, bride, stealing, and, rescue, thus, stock, phrase, reiteration, does, not, restrict, his, originality, in, fitting, story, to, rhyme, likewise, james, armstrong, 1958, reports, that, the, poem, s, formulae, yield, richer, meaning, because, the, arming, motif, diction, describing, achilles, agamemnon, paris, and, patroclus, serves, to, heighten, the, importance, of, an, impressive, moment, thus, creates, an, atmosphere, of, smoothness, wherein, homer, distinguishes, patroclus, from, achilles, and, foreshadows, the, former, s, death, with, positive, and, negative, turns, of, phrase, in, the, iliad, occasional, syntactic, inconsistency, may, be, an, oral, tradition, effect, for, example, aphrodite, is, laughter, loving, despite, being, painfully, wounded, by, diomedes, book, v, 375,

conceal, him, with, his, shining, shield, ajax, s, cumbersome, shield, is, more, suitable, for, defence, than, for, offence, while, his, cousin, achilles, sports, a, large, rounded, octagonal, shield, that, he, successfully, deploys, along, with, his, spear, against, the, trojans, just, as, a, man, constructs, a, wall, for, some, high, house, using, well, fitted, stones, to, keep, out, forceful,

scholars, do, not, believe, the, historical, trojan, war, was, so, fought, in, the, bronze, age, the, chariot, was, the, main, battle, transport, weapon, e, g, the, battle, of, kadesh, the, available, evidence, from, the, dendra, armour, and, the, pylos, palace, paintings, indicate, the, mycenaeans, used, two, man, chariots, with, a, long, spear, armed, principal, rider, unlike, the, three, man, hittite, chariots, with, short, spear, armed, riders, and, the, arrow, armed, egyptian, and, assyrian, two, man, chariots, nestor, spearheads, his, troops, with, chariots, he, advises, them, in, your,

man, whose, chariot, confronts, an, enemy, s, should, thrust, with, his, spear, at, him, from, there, that, s, the, most, effective, tactic, the, way, men, wiped, out, city, strongholds, long, ago, their, chests, full, of, that, style, and, spirit, although, homer, s, depictions, are, graphic, it, can, be, seen, in, the, very, end, that, victory, in, war, is, a, far, more, somber, occasion, where, all, that, is, lost, becomes, apparent, on, the, other, hand, the, funeral, games, are, lively, for, the, dead, man, s, life, is, celebrated, this, overall, depiction, of, war, runs, contrary, to, many, other, ancient, greek, depictions, where, war, is, an, aspiration, for, greater, glory, few, modern, archeologically, historically, and, homerically, accurate, reconstructions, of, arms, armor, and, motifs, as, described, by, homer, exist, some, historical, reconstructions, have, been, done, by, salimbeti, et, al, while, the, homeric, poems, particularly, the, iliad, were, not, necessarily, revered, scripture, of, the, ancient, greeks, they, were, most, certainly, seen, as, guides, that, were, important, to, the, intellectual, understanding, of, any, educated, greek, citizen, this, is, evidenced, by, the, fact, that, in, the, late, 5th, century, bc, it, was, the, sign, of, a, man, of, standing, to, be, able, to, recite, the, iliad, and, odyssey, by, heart, 36, moreover, it, can, be, argued, that, the, warfare, shown, in, the, iliad, and, the, way, it, is, depicted, had, a, profound, and, very, traceable, effect, on, greek, warfare, in, general, in, particular, the, effect, of, epic, literature, can, be, broken, down, into, three, categories, tactics, ideology, and, the, mindset, of, commanders, in, order, to, discern, these, effects, it, is, necessary, to, take, a, look, at, a, few, examples, from, each, of, these, categories, much, of, the, detailed, fighting, in, the, iliad, is, done, by, the, heroes, in, an, orderly, one, on, one, fashion, much, like, the, odyssey, there, is, even, a, set, ritual, that, must, be, observed, in, each, of, these, conflicts, for, example, a, major, hero, may, encounter, a, lesser, hero, from, the, opposing, side, in, which, case, the, minor, hero, is, introduced, threats, may, be, exchanged, and, then, the, minor, hero, is, slain, the, victor, often, strips, the, body, of, its, armor, and, military, accoutrements, 22, 23, here, is, an, example, of, this, ritual, and, this, type, of, one, on, one, combat, in, the, iliad, there, telamonian, ajax, struck, down, the, son, of, anthemion, simoeisios, in, his, stripling, s, beauty, whom, once, his, mother, descending, from, ida, bore, beside, the, banks, of, simoeis, when, she, had, followed, her, father, and, mother, to, tend, the, sheepflocks, therefore, they, called, him, simoeisios, but, he, could, not, render, again, the, care, of, his, dear, parents, he, was, short, lived, beaten, down, beneath, the, spear, of, high, hearted, ajax, who, struck, him, as, he, first, came, forward, beside, the, nipple, of, the, right, breast, and, the, bronze, spearhead, drove, clean, through, the, shoulder, the, most, important, question, in, reconciling, the, connection, between, the, epic, fighting, of, the, iliad, and, later, greek, warfare, concerns, the, phalanx, or, hoplite, warfare, seen, in, greek, history, well, after, homer, s, iliad, while, there, are, discussions, of, soldiers, arrayed, in, semblances, of, the, phalanx, throughout, the, iliad, the, focus, of, the, poem, on, the, heroic, fighting, as, mentioned, above, would, seem, to, contradict, the, tactics, of, the, phalanx, however, the, phalanx, did, have, its, heroic, aspects, the, masculine, one, on, one, fighting, of, the, epic, is, manifested, in, phalanx, fighting, with, the, emphasis, on, holding, one, s, position, in, formation, this, replaces, the, singular, heroic, competition, found, in, the, iliad, 51, one, example, of, this, is, the, spartan, tale, of, 300, picked, men, fighting, against, 300, picked, argives, in, this, battle, of, champions, only, two, men, are, left, standing, for, the, argives, and, one, for, the, spartans, othryades, the, remaining, spartan, goes, back, to, stand, in, his, formation, with, mortal, wounds, while, the, remaining, two, argives, go, back, to, argos, to, report, their, victory, thus, the, spartans, claimed, this, as, a, victory, as, their, last, man, displayed, the, ultimate, feat, of, bravery, by, maintaining, his, position, in, the, phalanx, in, terms, of, the, ideology, of, commanders, in, later, greek, history, the, iliad, has, an, interesting, effect, the, iliad, expresses, a, definite, disdain, for, tactical, trickery, when, hector, says, before, he, challenges, the, great, ajax, i, know, how, to, storm, my, way, into, the, struggle, of, flying, horses, i, know, how, to, tread, the, measures, on, the, grim, floor, of, the, war, god, yet, great, as, you, are, i, would, not, strike, you, by, stealth, watching, for, my, chance, but, openly, so, if, perhaps, i, might, hit, you, however, despite, examples, of, disdain, for, this, tactical, trickery, there, is, reason, to, believe, that, the, iliad, as, well, as, later, greek, warfare, endorses, tactical, genius, on, the, part, of, its, commanders, for, example, there, are, multiple, passages, in, the, iliad, with, commanders, such, as, agamemnon, or, nestor, discussing, the, arraying, of, troops, so, as, to, gain, an, advantage, indeed, the, trojan, war, is, won, by, a, notorious, example, of, achaean, guile, in, the, trojan, horse, this, is, even, later, referred, to, by, homer, in, the, odyssey, the, connection, in, this, case, between, the, guileful, tactics, of, the, achaeans, and, the, trojans, in, the, iliad, and, those, of, the, later, greeks, is, not, a, difficult, one, to, find, spartan, commanders, often, seen, as, the, pinnacle, of, greek, military, prowess, were, known, for, their, tactical, trickery, and, for, them, this, was, a, feat, to, be, desired, in, a, commander, indeed, this, type, of, leadership, was, the, standard, advice, of, greek, tactical, writers, 240, ultimately, while, homeric, or, epic, fighting, is, certainly, not, completely, replicated, in, later, greek, warfare, many, of, its, ideals, tactics, and, instructions, are, hans, van, wees, argues, that, the, descriptions, of, warfare, related, in, the, epic, can, be, pinned, down, fairly, specifically, to, the, first, half, of, the, 7th, century, bc, the, iliad, was, a, standard, work, of, great, importance, already, in, classical, greece, and, remained, so, throughout, the, hellenistic, and, byzantine, periods, subjects, from, the, trojan, war, were, a, favourite, among, ancient, greek, dramatists, aeschylus, trilogy, the, oresteia, comprising, agamemnon, the, libation, bearers, and, the, eumenides, follows, the, story, of, agamemnon, after, his, return, from, the, war, homer, also, came, to, be, of, great, influence, in, european, culture, with, the, resurgence, of, interest, in, greek, antiquity, during, the, renaissance, and, it, remains, the, first, and, most, influential, work, of, the, western, canon, in, its, full, form, the, text, made, its, return, to, italy, and, western, europe, beginning, in, the, 15th, century, primarily, through, translations, into, latin, and, the, vernacular, languages, prior, to, this, reintroduction, however, a, shortened, latin, version, of, the, poem, known, as, the, ilias, latina, was, very, widely, studied, and, read, as, a, basic, school, text, publius, baebius, italicus, a, roman, senator, is, credited, with, a, translation, of, the, iliad, in, the, decade, 60, a, d, 70, a, d, the, work, is, known, as, homerus, latinus, and, was, formerly, attributed, to, pindarus, thebaeus, the, west, tended, to, view, homer, as, unreliable, as, they, believed, they, possessed, much, more, down, to, earth, and, realistic, eyewitness, accounts, of, the, trojan, war, written, by, dares, and, dictys, cretensis, who, were, supposedly, present, at, the, events, these, late, antique, forged, accounts, formed, the, basis, of, several, eminently, popular, medieval, chivalric, romances, most, notably, those, of, beno, t, de, sainte, maure, and, guido, delle, colonne, these, in, turn, spawned, many, others, in, various, european, languages, such, as, the, first, printed, english, book, the, 1473, recuyell, of, the, historyes, of, troye, other, accounts, read, in, the, middle, ages, were, antique, latin, retellings, such, as, the, excidium, troiae, and, works, in, the, vernaculars, such, as, the, icelandic, troy, saga, even, without, homer, the, trojan, war, story, had, remained, central, to, western, european, medieval, literary, culture, and, its, sense, of, identity, most, nations, and, several, royal, houses, traced, their, origins, to, heroes, at, the, trojan, war, britain, was, supposedly, settled, by, the, trojan, brutus, for, instance, william, shakespeare, used, the, plot, of, the, iliad, as, source, material, for, his, play, troilus, and, cressida, but, focused, on, a, medieval, legend, the, love, story, of, troilus, son, of, king, priam, of, troy, and, cressida, daughter, of, the, trojan, soothsayer, calchas, the, play, often, considered, to, be, a, comedy,

according, to, suleyman, al, boustani, a, 19th, century, poet, who, made, the, first, arabic, translation, of, the, iliad, to, arabic, the, epic, may, have, been, widely, circulated, in, syriac, and, pahlavi, translations, during, the, early, middle, ages, al, boustani, credits, theophilus, of, edessa, with, the, syriac, translation, which, was, supposedly, along, with, the, greek, original, widely, read, or, heard, by, the, scholars, of, baghdad, in, the, prime, of, the, abbasid, caliphate, although, those, scholars, never, took, the, effort, to, translate, it, to, the, official,
