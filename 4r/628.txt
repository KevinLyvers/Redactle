small, fraction, of, the, wealth, held, at, aqaba, however, lawrence, s, scheme, is, almost, derailed, when, one, of, ali, s, men, kills, one, of, auda, s, men, because, of, a, blood, feud, since,

shoots, him, anyway, the, next, morning, the, arabs, overrun, the, turkish, garrison, auda, is, outraged, to, find, there, is, actually, no, gold, in, aqaba, but, lawrence, promises, him, that, the,

britain, as, his, usefulness, to, both, faisal, and, the, british, is, at, an, end, as, he, leaves, the, city, he, looks, longingly, at, the, departing, arabs, before, his, car, is, passed, by, a, motorcyclist, who, leaves, a, trail, of, dust, in, his, wake, the, crew, consisted, of, over, 200, people, including, cast, and, extras, over, 1, 000, people, worked, on, the, film, members, of, the,

scene, most, of, the, film, s, characters, are, based, on, historical, figures, but, to, varying, degrees, some, scenes, were, heavily, fictionalised, such, as, the, battle, of, aqaba, and, those, dealing, with, the, arab, council, were, inaccurate, since, the, council, remained, more, or, less, in, power, in, syria, until, france, deposed, faisal, in, 1920, little, background, is, provided, on, the, history, of, the, region, the, first, world, war, and, the, arab, revolt, probably, because, of, bolt, s, increased, focus, on, lawrence, wilson, s, draft, script, had, a, broader, more, politicised, version, of, events, the, second, half, of, the, film, presents, a, fictional, desertion, of, lawrence, s, arab, army, almost, to, a, man, as, he, moved, farther, north, the, film, s, timeline, inaccurately, depicts, the, chronology, of, the, arab, revolt, and, first, world, war, as, well, as, the, geography, of, the, hejaz, region, bentley, s, meeting, with, faisal, in, which, he, mentions, that, the, united, states, has, not, yet, entered, the, war, is, in, late, 1917, after, the, fall, of, aqaba, months, after, the, american, entry, into, the, war, lawrence, s, involvement, in, the, arab, revolt, prior, to, the, attack, on, aqaba, is, absent, as, are, his, involvement, in, the, seizures, of, yenbo, and, wejh, the, rescue, and, the, execution, of, gasim, are, based, on, two, incidents, that, were, conflated, for, dramatic, reasons, the, film, shows, lawrence, representing, the, allied, cause, in, the, hejaz, almost, alone, with, colonel, brighton, anthony, quayle, as, the, only, british, officer, there, to, assist, him, in, fact, there, were, numerous, british, officers, such, as, colonels, cyril, wilson, stewart, newcombe, and, pierce, c, joyce, all, of, whom, arrived, before, lawrence, began, serving, in, arabia, there, was, a, french, military, mission, led, by, colonel, douard, br, mond, serving, in, the, hejaz, but, it, is, not, mentioned, in, the, film, the, film, shows, lawrence, as, the, originator, of, the, attacks, on, the, hejaz, railway, the, first, attacks, began, in, early, january, 1917, led, by, officers, such, as, newcombe, the, first, successful, attack, on, the, hejaz, railway, with, a, locomotive, destroying, garland, mine, was, led, by, major, herbert, garland, in, february, 1917, a, month, before, lawrence, s, first, attack, the, film, shows, the, hashemite, forces, consisting, of, bedouin, guerrillas, but, the, core, of, the, hashemite, force, was, the, regular, arab, army, recruited, from, ottoman, arab, prisoners, of, war, they, wore, british, style, uniforms, with, keffiyehs, and, fought, in, conventional, battles, the, film, makes, no, mention, of, the, sharifian, army, and, leaves, the, viewer, with, the, impression, that, the, hashemite, forces, were, composed, exclusively, of, bedouin, irregulars, many, complaints, about, the, film, s, accuracy, concern, the, characterisation, of, lawrence, the, perceived, problems, with, the, portrayal, begin, with, the, differences, in, his, physical, appearance, the, 6, ft, 2, in, 1, 88, m, peter, o, toole, was, almost, 9, in, 23, cm, taller, than, the, 5, ft, 5, in, 1, 65, m, lawrence, and, extended, to, his, behaviour, the, screenwriters, depict, lawrence, as, an, egotist, it, is, not, clear, to, what, degree, lawrence, sought, or, shunned, attention, as, evidenced, by, his, use, of, various, assumed, names, after, the, war, even, during, the, war, lowell, thomas, wrote, in, with, lawrence, in, arabia, that, he, could, take, pictures, of, him, only, by, tricking, him, although, lawrence, later, agreed, to, pose, for, several, photos, for, thomas, s, stage, show, thomas, s, famous, comment, that, lawrence, had, a, genius, for, backing, into, the, limelight, suggests, that, his, extraordinary, actions, prevented, him, from, being, as, private, as, he, would, have, liked, or, may, suggest, that, lawrence, made, a, pretence, of, avoiding, the, limelight, but, subtly, placed, himself, at, centre, stage, others, point, to, lawrence, s, writings, to, support, the, argument, that, he, was, egotistical, lawrence, s, sexual, orientation, remains, a, controversial, topic, among, historians, bolt, s, primary, source, was, ostensibly, seven, pillars, but, the, film, s, portrayal, seems, informed, by, richard, aldington, s, biographical, inquiry, 1955, which, posited, lawrence, as, a, pathological, liar, and, exhibitionist, as, well, as, a, homosexual, that, is, opposed, to, his, portrayal, in, ross, as, a, physically, and, spiritually, broken, recluse, historians, like, b, h, liddell, hart, disputed, the, film, s, depiction, of, lawrence, as, an, active, participant, in, the, attack, and, slaughter, of, the, retreating, turkish, columns, who, had, committed, the, tafas, massacre, but, most, current, biographers, accept, the, film, s, portrayal, as, reasonably, accurate, the, film, shows, that, lawrence, spoke, and, read, arabic, could, quote, the, quran, and, was, reasonably, knowledgeable, about, the, region, it, barely, mentions, his, archaeological, travels, from, 1911, to, 1914, in, syria, and, arabia, and, ignores, his, espionage, work, including, a, pre, war, topographical, survey, of, the, sinai, peninsula, and, his, attempts, to, negotiate, the, release, of, british, prisoners, at, kut, mesopotamia, in, 1916, lawrence, is, made, aware, of, the, sykes, picot, agreement, very, late, in, the, story, and, is, shown, to, be, appalled, by, it, but, he, may, well, have, known, about, it, much, earlier, while, he, fought, with, the, arabs, lawrence, s, biographers, have, a, mixed, reaction, towards, the, film, the, authorised, biographer, jeremy, wilson, noted, that, the, film, has, undoubtedly, influenced, the, perceptions, of, some, subsequent, biographers, such, as, the, depiction, of, the, film, s, ali, being, a, real, rather, than, a, composite, character, and, the, highlighting, of, the, deraa, incident, the, film, s, historical, inaccuracies, in, wilson, s, view, are, more, questionable, than, should, be, allowed, under, normal, dramatic, licence, liddell, hart, criticised, the, film, and, engaged, bolt, in, a, lengthy, correspondence, over, its, portrayal, of, lawrence, the, film, portrays, allenby, as, cynical, and, manipulative, with, a, superior, attitude, to, lawrence, but, there, is, much, evidence, that, allenby, and, lawrence, liked, and, respected, each, other, lawrence, once, said, that, allenby, was, an, admiration, of, mine, and, later, that, he, was, physically, large, and, confident, and, morally, so, great, that, the, comprehension, of, our, littleness, came, slow, to, him, the, fictional, allenby, s, words, at, lawrence, s, funeral, in, the, film, stand, in, contrast, to, the, real, allenby, s, remarks, upon, lawrence, s, death, i, have, lost, a, good, friend, and, a, valued, comrade, lawrence, was, under, my, command, but, after, acquainting, him, with, my, strategical, plan, i, gave, him, a, free, hand, his, co, operation, was, marked, by, the, utmost, loyalty, and, i, never, had, anything, but, praise, for, his, work, which, indeed, was, invaluable, throughout, the, campaign, allenby, spoke, highly, of, him, numerous, times, and, much, to, lawrence, s, delight, publicly, endorsed, the, accuracy, of, seven, pillars, of, wisdom, although, allenby, manipulated, lawrence, during, the, war, their, relationship, lasted, for, years, afterwards, indicating, that, in, real, life, they, were, friendly, if, not, close, the, allenby, family, was, particularly, upset, by, the, damascus, scenes, in, which, allenby, coldly, allows, the, town, to, fall, into, chaos, as, the, arab, council, collapses, murray, was, initially, sceptical, of, the, arab, revolt, s, potential, but, thought, highly, of, lawrence, s, abilities, as, an, intelligence, officer, it, was, largely, through, lawrence, s, persuasion, that, murray, came, to, support, the, revolt, the, intense, dislike, shown, toward, lawrence, in, the, film, is, the, opposite, of, murray, s, real, feelings, but, lawrence, seemed, not, to, hold, murray, in, any, high, regard, the, depiction, of, auda, abu, tayi, as, a, man, interested, only, in, loot, and, money, is, at, odds, with, the, historical, record, although, auda, at, first, joined, the, revolt, for, monetary, reasons, he, became, a, steadfast, supporter, of, arab, independence, notably, after, aqaba, s, capture, despite, repeated, bribery, attempts, by, the, turks, he, took, their, money, but, remained, loyal, to, the, revolt, and, went, so, far, as, to, knock, out, his, false, teeth, which, were, turkish, made, he, was, present, with, lawrence, from, the, beginning, of, the, aqaba, expedition, and, helped, to, plan, it, along, with, lawrence, and, prince, faisal, faisal, was, not, the, middle, aged, man, depicted, as, he, was, in, his, early, thirties, faisal, and, lawrence, respected, each, other, s, capabilities, and, intelligence, and, worked, well, together, the, reactions, of, those, who, knew, lawrence, and, the, other, characters, cast, doubt, on, the, film, s, veracity, the, most, vehement, critic, of, its, accuracy, was, professor, a, w, lawrence, t, e, lawrence, s, younger, brother, and, literary, executor, who, had, sold, the, rights, to, seven, pillars, of, wisdom, to, spiegel, for, 25, 000, and, went, on, a, campaign, in, the, united, states, and, britain, to, denounce, the, film, he, said, i, should, not, have, recognised, my, own, brother, in, one, pointed, talk, show, appearance, he, remarked, that, he, had, found, the, film, pretentious, and, false, and, that, his, brother, was, one, of, the, nicest, kindest, and, most, exhilarating, people, i, ve, known, he, often, appeared, cheerful, when, he, was, unhappy, later, he, said, to, the, new, york, times, a, psychological, recipe, take, an, ounce, of, narcissism, a, pound, of, exhibitionism, a, pint, of, sadism, a, gallon, of, blood, lust, and, a, sprinkle, of, other, aberrations, and, stir, well, lowell, thomas, was, critical, of, the, portrayal, of, lawrence, and, of, most, of, the, film, s, characters, and, believed, that, the, train, attack, scenes, were, the, only, reasonably, accurate, aspect, of, the, film, criticisms, were, not, restricted, to, lawrence, allenby, s, family, lodged, a, formal, complaint, against, columbia, about, his, portrayal, descendants, of, auda, abu, tayi, and, sharif, nassir, upon, whom, the, film, s, ali, was, partially, based, went, further, by, suing, columbia, the, auda, case, went, on, for, almost, 10, years, before, it, was, dropped, the, film, has, its, defenders, biographer, michael, korda, the, author, of, hero, the, life, and, legend, of, lawrence, of, arabia, offers, a, different, opinion, the, film, is, neither, the, full, story, of, lawrence, s, life, or, a, completely, accurate, account, of, the, two, years, he, spent, fighting, with, the, arabs, korda, said, that, criticising, its, inaccuracy, misses, the, point, the, object, was, to, produce, not, a, faithful, docudrama, that, would, educate, the, audience, but, a, hit, picture, stephen, e, tabachnick, goes, further, than, korda, by, arguing, that, the, film, s, portrayal, of, lawrence, is, appropriate, and, true, to, the, text, of, seven, pillars, of, wisdom, david, murphy, historian, and, author, of, the, 2008, book, the, arab, revolt, wrote, that, although, the, film, was, flawed, with, inaccuracies, and, omissions, it, was, a, truly, epic, movie, and, is, rightly, seen, as, a, classic, previous, films, about, t, e, lawrence, had, been, planned, but, had, not, been, made, in, the, 1940s, alexander, korda, was, interested, in, filming, the, seven, pillars, of, wisdom, with, laurence, olivier, leslie, howard, or, robert, donat, as, lawrence, but, had, to, pull, out, owing, to, financial, difficulties, david, lean, had, been, approached, to, direct, a, 1952, version, for, the, rank, organisation, but, the, project, fell, through, at, the, same, time, as, pre, production, of, the, film, terence, rattigan, was, developing, his, play, ross, which, centred, primarily, on, lawrence, s, alleged, homosexuality, ross, had, begun, as, a, screenplay, but, was, re, written, for, the, stage, when, the, film, project, fell, through, sam, spiegel, grew, furious, and, attempted, to, have, the, play, suppressed, which, helped, to, gain, publicity, for, the, film, dirk, bogarde, had, accepted, the, role, in, ross, he, described, the, cancellation, of, the, project, as, my, bitterest, disappointment, alec, guinness, played, the, role, on, stage, lean, and, sam, spiegel, had, worked, together, on, the, bridge, on, the, river, kwai, and, decided, to, collaborate, again, for, a, time, lean, was, interested, in, a, biopic, of, gandhi, with, alec, guinness, to, play, the, title, role, and, emeric, pressburger, writing, the, screenplay, he, eventually, lost, interest, in, the, project, despite, extensive, pre, production, work, including, location, scouting, in, india, and, a, meeting, with, jawaharlal, nehru, lean, then, returned, his, attention, to, t, e, lawrence, columbia, pictures, had, an, interest, in, a, lawrence, project, dating, back, to, the, early, 50s, and, the, project, got, underway, when, spiegel, convinced, a, reluctant, a, w, lawrence, to, sell, the, rights, to, seven, pillars, of, wisdom, for, 22, 500, michael, wilson, wrote, the, original, draft, of, the, screenplay, lean, was, dissatisfied, with, wilson, s, work, primarily, because, his, treatment, focused, on, the, historical, and, political, aspects, of, the, arab, revolt, lean, hired, robert, bolt, to, re, write, the, script, to, make, it, a, character, study, of, lawrence, many, of, the, characters, and, scenes, are, wilson, s, invention, but, virtually, all, of, the, dialogue, in, the, finished, film, was, written, by, bolt, lean, reportedly, watched, john, ford, s, 1956, film, the, searchers, to, help, him, develop, ideas, as, to, how, to, shoot, the, film, several, scenes, directly, recall, ford, s, film, most, notably, ali, s, entrance, at, the, well, and, the, composition, of, many, of, the, desert, scenes, and, the, dramatic, exit, from, wadi, rum, lean, biographer, kevin, brownlow, noted, a, physical, similarity, between, wadi, rum, and, ford, s, monument, valley, in, an, interview, with, the, washington, post, in, 1989, lean, said, that, lawrence, and, ali, were, written, as, being, in, a, gay, relationship, when, asked, about, whether, the, film, was, pervasively, homoerotic, lean, responded, yes, of, course, it, is, throughout, i, ll, never, forget, standing, there, in, the, desert, once, with, some, of, these, tough, arab, buggers, some, of, the, toughest, we, had, and, i, suddenly, thought, he, s, making, eyes, at, me, and,
