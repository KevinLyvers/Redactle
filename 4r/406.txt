the, mass, in, b, minor, german, h, moll, messe, bwv, 232, is, an, extended, setting, of, the, mass, ordinary, by, johann, sebastian, bach, the, composition, was, completed, in, 1749, the, year, before, the, composer, s, death, and, was, to, a, large, extent, based, on, earlier, work, such, as, a, sanctus, bach, had, composed, in, 1724, sections, that, were, specifically, composed, to, complete, the, mass, in, the, late, 1740s, include, the, et, incarnatus, est, part, of, the, credo, as, usual, for, its, time, the, composition, is, formatted, as, a, neapolitan, mass, consisting, of, a, succession, of, choral, movements, with, a, broad, orchestral, accompaniment, and, sections, in, which, a, more, limited, group, of, instrumentalists, accompanies, one, or, more, vocal, soloists, among, the, more, unusual, characteristics, of, the, composition, is, its, scale, a, total, performance, time, of, around, two, hours, and, a, scoring, consisting, of, two, groups, of, satb, singers, and, an, orchestra, featuring, an, extended, winds, section, strings, and, continuo, its, key, b, minor, is, rather, exceptional, for, a, composition, featuring, natural, trumpets, in, d, although, far, more, of, the, work, is, in, this, key, than, b, minor, even, more, exceptional, for, a, lutheran, composer, such, as, bach, is, that, the, composition, is, a, missa, tota, in, bach, s, day, masses, composed, for, lutheran, services, usually, consisted, only, of, a, kyrie, and, gloria, bach, had, composed, five, such, kyrie, gloria, masses, before, he, completed, his, mass, in, b, minor, the, kyrie, gloria, masses, bwv, 233, 236, in, the, late, 1730s, and, the, mass, for, the, dresden, court, which, would, become, part, i, of, his, only, missa, tota, in, 1733, the, mass, was, likely, never, performed, in, its, entirety, during, bach, s, lifetime, its, earliest, documented, complete, performance, took, place, in, 1859, with, many, dozens, of, recordings, it, is, among, bach, s, most, popular, vocal, works, in, 2015, bach, s, personal, handwritten, manuscript, of, the, mass, held, by, the, berlin, state, library, was, included, in, the, unesco, s, memory, of, the, world, register, a, project, to, protect, and, preserve, culturally, significant, documents, and, manuscripts, on, 1, february, 1733, augustus, ii, the, strong, king, of, poland, grand, duke, of, lithuania, and, elector, of, saxony, died, five, months, of, mourning, followed, during, which, all, public, music, making, was, suspended, bach, used, the, opportunity, to, work, on, the, composition, of, a, missa, a, portion, of, the, liturgy, sung, in, latin, and, common, to, both, the, lutheran, and, roman, catholic, rites, his, aim, was, to, dedicate, the, work, to, the, new, sovereign, augustus, iii, a, convert, to, catholicism, with, the, hope, of, obtaining, the, title, electoral, saxon, court, composer, upon, its, completion, bach, visited, augustus, iii, in, dresden, and, presented, him, with, a, copy, of, the, kyrie, gloria, mass, bwv, 232, i, early, version, together, with, a, petition, to, be, given, a, court, title, dated, july, 27, 1733, in, the, accompanying, inscription, on, the, wrapper, of, the, mass, he, complains, that, he, had, innocently, suffered, one, injury, or, another, in, leipzig, the, petition, did, not, meet, with, immediate, success, but, bach, eventually, got, his, title, he, was, made, court, composer, to, augustus, iii, in, 1736, in, the, last, years, of, his, life, bach, expanded, the, missa, into, a, complete, setting, of, the, latin, ordinary, it, is, not, known, what, prompted, this, creative, effort, wolfgang, osthoff, and, other, scholars, have, suggested, that, bach, intended, the, completed, mass, in, b, minor, for, performance, at, the, dedication, of, the, new, hofkirche, in, dresden, a, catholic, cathedral, dedicated, to, the, holy, trinity, which, was, begun, in, 1738, and, was, nearing, completion, by, the, late, 1740s, however, the, building, was, not, completed, until, 1751, and, bach, s, death, in, july, 1750, prevented, his, mass, from, being, submitted, for, use, at, the, dedication, instead, johann, adolph, hasse, s, mass, in, d, minor, was, performed, a, work, with, many, similarities, to, bach, s, mass, the, credo, movements, in, both, works, feature, chant, over, a, walking, bass, line, for, example, in, 2013, michael, maul, published, research, suggesting, the, possibility, that, instead, bach, compiled, it, for, performance, in, vienna, at, st, stephen, s, cathedral, which, was, roman, catholic, on, st, cecilia, s, day, in, 1749, as, a, result, of, his, association, with, count, johann, adam, von, questenberg, other, explanations, are, less, event, specific, involving, bach, s, interest, in, encyclopedic, projects, like, the, art, of, fugue, that, display, a, wide, range, of, styles, and, bach, s, desire, to, preserve, some, of, his, best, vocal, music, in, a, format, with, wider, potential, future, use, than, the, church, cantatas, they, originated, in, see, movements, and, their, sources, below, the, chronology, of, the, mass, in, b, minor, has, attracted, extensive, scholarly, attention, recent, literature, suggests, bach, did, not, give, the, mass, in, b, minor, a, title, instead, he, organized, the, 1748, 49, manuscript, into, four, folders, each, with, a, different, title, that, containing, the, kyrie, and, gloria, he, called, 1, missa, that, containing, the, credo, he, titled, 2, symbolum, nicenum, the, third, folder, containing, the, sanctus, he, called, 3, sanctus, and, the, remainder, in, a, fourth, folder, he, titled, 4, osanna, benedictus, agnus, dei, et, dona, nobis, pacem, john, butt, writes, the, format, seems, purposely, designed, so, that, each, of, the, four, sections, could, be, used, separately, on, the, other, hand, the, parts, in, the, manuscript, are, numbered, from, 1, to, 4, and, bach, s, usual, closing, formula, s, d, g, soli, deo, gloria, is, only, found, at, the, end, of, the, dona, nobis, pacem, further, butt, writes, what, is, most, remarkable, about, the, overall, shape, of, the, mass, in, b, minor, is, that, bach, managed, to, shape, a, coherent, sequence, of, movements, from, diverse, material, butt, and, george, stauffer, detail, the, ways, in, which, bach, gave, overall, musical, unity, to, the, work, the, first, overall, title, given, to, the, work, was, in, the, 1790, estate, of, the, recently, deceased, c, p, e, bach, who, inherited, the, score, there, it, is, called, die, grosse, catholische, messe, the, great, catholic, mass, it, is, called, that, as, well, in, the, estate, of, his, last, heir, in, 1805, suggesting, to, stauffer, that, the, epithet, reflects, an, oral, tradition, within, the, bach, family, the, first, publication, of, the, kyrie, and, gloria, in, 1833, by, the, swiss, collector, hans, georg, n, geli, with, simrock, refers, to, it, as, messe, finally, nageli, and, simrock, produced, the, first, publication, in, 1845, calling, it, the, high, mass, in, b, minor, hohe, messe, in, h, moll, the, adjective, high, butt, argues, was, strongly, influenced, by, the, monumental, impact, of, beethoven, s, missa, solemnis, it, soon, fell, from, common, usage, but, the, prepositional, phrase, in, b, minor, survives, even, though, it, is, in, some, ways, misleading, only, five, of, the, work, s, 27, movements, are, in, b, minor, while, twelve, including, the, final, ones, of, each, of, the, four, major, sections, are, in, d, major, the, relative, major, of, b, minor, the, opening, kyrie, however, is, in, b, minor, with, the, christe, eleison, in, d, major, and, the, second, kyrie, in, f, sharp, minor, as, butt, points, out, these, tonalities, outline, a, b, minor, chord, the, piece, is, orchestrated, for, two, flutes, two, oboes, d, amore, doubling, on, oboes, two, bassoons, one, natural, horn, in, d, three, natural, trumpets, in, d, timpani, violins, i, and, ii, violas, and, basso, continuo, cellos, basses, bassoons, organ, and, harpsichord, a, third, oboe, is, required, for, the, sanctus, bach, conducted, the, sanctus, in, its, first, version, at, the, 1724, christmas, service, in, leipzig, and, re, used, it, in, christmas, services, in, the, mid, 1740s, scholars, differ, on, whether, he, ever, performed, the, 1733, missa, arnold, schering, in, 1936, asserted, that, it, was, performed, in, leipzig, on, april, 26, 1733, when, augustus, iii, of, poland, visited, the, town, but, modern, scholars, reject, his, argument, for, several, reasons, scholars, differ, however, on, whether, the, missa, was, performed, in, july, in, dresden, christoph, wolff, argues, that, on, july, 26, 1733, at, the, sophienkirche, in, dresden, where, wilhelm, friedemann, bach, had, been, organist, since, june, it, was, definitely, performed, as, evidenced, by, the, extant, dresden, performing, parts, and, by, the, inscription, on, the, title, wrapper, given, to, the, king, the, next, day, hans, joachim, schulze, made, this, case, by, pointing, to, the, use, of, the, past, tense, in, the, wrapper, s, inscription, to, his, royal, majesty, was, shown, with, the, enclosed, missa, the, humble, devotion, of, the, author, j, s, bach, however, joshua, rifkin, rejects, the, argument, pointing, out, that, the, past, tense, wording, was, typical, of, formal, address, often, not, related, to, performance, also, skeptical, is, peter, williams, who, notes, that, there, is, no, record, of, performers, being, assembled, for, such, an, event, and, in, august, 1731, friedemann, reported, that, the, sophienkirche, organ, was, badly, out, of, tune, however, there, is, evidence, of, an, organ, recital, by, bach, at, the, sophienkirche, on, 14, september, 1731, and, friedemann, bach, was, only, chosen, as, organist, for, the, institution, on, 23, june, 1733, he, would, again, perform, a, 2, hour, organ, recital, on, 1, december, 1736, at, the, frauenkirche, dresden, to, inaugurate, the, new, gottfried, silbermann, organ, scholars, agree, that, no, other, public, performances, took, place, in, bach, s, lifetime, although, butt, raises, the, possibility, that, there, may, have, been, a, private, performance, or, read, through, of, the, symbolum, nicenum, late, in, bach, s, life, the, first, public, performance, of, the, symbolum, nicenum, section, under, the, title, credo, or, nicene, creed, took, place, 36, years, after, bach, s, death, in, spring, of, 1786, led, by, his, son, carl, philipp, emanuel, bach, at, a, benefit, concert, for, the, medical, institute, for, the, poor, in, hamburg, one, of, bach, s, admirers, joseph, haydn, had, a, copy, of, the, work, along, with, the, well, tempered, clavier, as, recounted, by, george, stauffer, the, next, documented, performance, not, public, in, the, nineteenth, century, was, when, carl, friedrich, zelter, a, key, figure, in, the, 19th, century, bach, revival, led, the, berlin, singakademie, in, read, throughs, of, the, great, mass, in, 1811, covering, the, kyrie, in, 1813, he, led, read, throughs, of, the, entire, work, the, first, public, performance, in, the, century, of, just, the, credo, section, took, place, in, frankfurt, in, march, 1828, with, over, 200, performers, and, many, instrumental, additions, in, the, same, year, in, berlin, gaspare, spontini, led, the, credo, section, adding, 15, new, choral, parts, and, numerous, instruments, a, number, of, performances, of, sections, of, the, mass, took, place, in, the, following, decades, in, europe, but, the, first, attested, public, performance, of, the, mass, in, its, entirety, took, place, in, 1859, in, leipzig, with, karl, riedel, and, the, riedel, verein, the, first, performance, of, the, mass, in, the, uk, was, given, by, the, bach, choir, newly, formed, for, this, purpose, by, conductor, otto, goldschmidt, in, 1876, in, st, james, s, hall, london, the, bach, choir, of, bethlehem, performed, the, american, premiere, of, the, complete, mass, on, march, 27, 1900, in, bethlehem, pennsylvania, though, there, is, evidence, that, parts, of, the, mass, had, been, performed, in, the, united, states, as, early, as, 1870, from, early, in, the, century, authors, such, as, albert, schweitzer, arnold, schering, and, frederick, smend, called, for, smaller, performance, forces, and, experiments, with, relatively, smaller, groups, began, in, the, late, 1920s, the, first, complete, recording, of, the, work, was, made, in, 1929, with, a, large, choir, and, the, london, symphony, orchestra, led, by, albert, coates, as, of, 2013, a, database, lists, over, 200, recordings, with, many, different, types, of, forces, and, performance, styles, the, work, has, played, a, central, role, in, the, historical, performance, movement, nikolaus, harnoncourt, made, the, first, recording, with, period, instruments, in, 1968, his, second, bach, choral, recording, joshua, rifkin, s, first, recording, using, the, one, voice, per, part, vocal, scoring, he, proposes, was, made, in, 1982, and, won, a, 1983, gramophone, award, the, mass, in, b, minor, is, widely, regarded, as, one, of, the, supreme, achievements, of, classical, music, alberto, basso, summarizes, the, work, as, follows, the, mass, in, b, minor, is, the, consecration, of, a, whole, life, started, in, 1733, for, diplomatic, reasons, it, was, finished, in, the, very, last, years, of, bach, s, life, when, he, had, already, gone, blind, this, monumental, work, is, a, synthesis, of, every, stylistic, and, technical, contribution, the, cantor, of, leipzig, made, to, music, but, it, is, also, the, most, astounding, spiritual, encounter, between, the, worlds, of, catholic, glorification, and, the, lutheran, cult, of, the, cross, scholars, have, suggested, that, the, mass, in, b, minor, belongs, in, the, same, category, as, the, art, of, fugue, as, a, summation, of, bach, s, deep, lifelong, involvement, with, musical, tradition, in, this, case, with, choral, settings, and, theology, bach, scholar, christoph, wolff, describes, the, work, as, representing, a, summary, of, his, writing, for, voice, not, only, in, its, variety, of, styles, compositional, devices, and, range, of, sonorities, but, also, in, its, high, level, of, technical, polish, bach, s, mighty, setting, preserved, the, musical, and, artistic, creed, of, its, creator, for, posterity, the, mass, was, described, in, the, 19th, century, by, the, editor, hans, georg, n, geli, as, the, announcement, of, the, greatest, musical, work, of, all, times, and, all, people, ank, ndigung, des, gr, ten, musikalischen, kunstwerkes, aller, zeiten, und, v, lker, despite, being, seldom, performed, the, mass, was, appreciated, by, some, of, bach, s, greatest, successors, by, the, beginning, of, the, 19th, century, forkel, and, haydn, possessed, copies, two, autograph, sources, exist, the, parts, for, the, kyrie, and, gloria, sections, that, bach, deposited, in, dresden, in, 1733, and, the, score, of, the, complete, work, that, bach, compiled, in, 1748, 50, which, was, inherited, by, c, p, e, bach, the, autograph, has, been, published, in, facsimile, from, the, source, in, the, staatsbibliothek, zu, berlin, however, for, his, 1786, public, performance, of, the, symbolum, nicenum, c, p, e, bach, as, was, typical, practice, in, the, era, made, additions, to, the, autograph, score, for, performance, by, adding, a, 28, bar, introduction, replacing, the, now, obsolete, oboe, d, amore, with, newer, instruments, clarinets, oboes, or, violins, and, making, other, changes, in, instrumentation, for, his, own, aesthetic, reasons, c, p, e, also, wrote, in, his, own, solutions, to, reading, some, passages, made, nearly, illegible, by, his, father, s, late, life, handwriting, problems, for, this, and, other, reasons, the, mass, in, b, minor, poses, a, considerable, challenge, to, prospective, editors, and, substantial, variations, can, be, noted, in, different, editions, even, critical, urtext, editions, the, bach, gesellschaft, edition, edited, by, julius, rietz, was, published, in, 1856, based, on, several, sources, but, without, direct, access, to, the, autograph, when, access, was, later, obtained, the, textual, problems, were, so, evident, that, the, society, published, a, revised, edition, the, next, year, the, 1857, edition, was, the, standard, for, the, next, century, but, was, later, recognized, to, be, even, less, accurate, than, the, 1856, version, due, to, inadvertent, incorporation, of, c, p, e, bach, s, alterations, in, the, autograph, similarly, the, 1954, edition, by, friedrich, smend, for, the, neue, bach, ausgabe, was, shown, to, have, significant, faults, within, five, years, of, publication, christoph, wolff, s, edition, published, by, c, f, peters, in, 1997, uses, two, copies, of, the, 1748, 50, manuscript, made, before, c, p, e, bach, s, adulterations, to, try, to, reconstruct, bach, s, original, readings, and, seeks, to, recover, performance, details, by, using, all, available, sources, including, cantata, movements, that, bach, reworked, in, the, b, minor, mass, joshua, rifkin, s, edition, published, by, breitkopf, h, rtel, in, 2006, also, seeks, to, remove, the, c, p, e, bach, emendations, but, differs, from, wolff, in, arguing, that, the, 1748, 50, work, is, to, quote, john, butt, essentially, a, different, entity, from, the, 1733, missa, and, that, a, combination, of, the, best, readings, from, both, does, not, really, correspond, to, bach, s, final, and, virtually, completed, conception, of, the, work, rifkin, s, version, seeks, to, adhere, to, this, final, version, uwe, wolf, s, edition, published, by, b, renreiter, in, 2010, relies, upon, x, ray, spectrograph, technology, to, differentiate, j, s, bach, s, handwriting, from, the, additions, made, by, c, p, e, bach, and, others, ulrich, leisinger, s, edition, published, by, carus, in, 2014, accepts, some, of, c, p, e, bach, s, revisions, and, uses, the, 1733, dresden, parts, as, the, primary, source, for, the, kyrie, and, gloria, the, work, consists, of, 27, sections, tempo, and, metrical, information, and, parodied, cantata, sources, come, from, christoph, wolff, s, 1997, critical, urtext, edition, and, from, george, stauffer, s, bach, the, mass, in, b, minor, except, where, noted, regarding, sources, stauffer, summarizing, current, research, as, of, 1997, states, that, specific, models, or, fragments, can, be, pinpointed, for, eleven, of, the, work, s, twenty, seven, movements, and, that, two, other, movements, are, most, probably, derived, from, specific, now, lost, sources, but, stauffer, adds, there, is, undoubtedly, much, more, borrowing, than, this, exceptions, are, the, opening, four, bars, of, the, first, kyrie, the, et, incarnatus, est, and, confiteor, butt, points, out, that, only, with, a, musical, aesthetic, later, than, bach, s, does, the, concept, of, parody, adapting, existing, vocal, music, to, a, new, text, appear, in, an, unfavourable, light, while, it, was, almost, unavoidable, in, bach, s, day, he, further, notes, that, by, abstracting, movements, from, what, he, evidently, considered, some, of, his, finest, vocal, works, originally, performed, for, specific, occasions, and, sundays, within, the, church, s, year, he, was, doubtless, attempting, to, preserve, the, pieces, within, the, more, durable, context, of, the, latin, ordinary, details, of, the, parodied, movements, and, their, sources, are, given, below, note, the, nine, trinitarian, 3, 3, movements, that, follow, with, a, largely, symmetrical, structure, and, the, domine, deus, in, the, centre, note, the, nine, movements, with, the, symmetrical, structure, and, the, crucifixion, at, the, centre, as, of, 2015, 237, recordings, are, listed, on, bach, cantatas, beginning, with, the, first, recording, by, a, symphony, orchestra, and, choir, to, match, conducted, by, albert, coates, beginning, in, the, late, 1960s, historically, informed, performances, paved, the, way, for, recordings, with, smaller, groups, boys, choirs, and, ensembles, playing, period, instruments, and, eventually, to, recordings, using, the, one, voice, on, a, vocal, part, scoring, first, argued, for, by, joshua, rifkin, in, 1982
