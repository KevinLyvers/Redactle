abolition, of, slavery, following, the, american, civil, war, after, its, dedication, the, statue, became, an, icon, of, freedom, and, of, the, united, states, being, subsequently, seen, as, a, symbol, of, welcome, to, immigrants, arriving, by, sea, the, idea, for, the, statue, was, conceived, in, 1865, when, the, french, historian, and, abolitionist, douard, de, laboulaye, proposed, a, monument, to, commemorate, the, upcoming, centennial, of, u, s, independence, 1876, the, perseverance, of, american, democracy, and, the, liberation, of, the, nation, s, slaves, the, franco, prussian, war, delayed, progress, until, 1875, when, laboulaye, proposed, that, the, people, of, france, finance, the, statue, and, the, united, states, provide, the, site, and, build, the, pedestal, bartholdi, completed, the, head, and, the, torch, bearing, arm, before, the, statue, was, fully, designed, and, these, pieces, were, exhibited, for, publicity, at, international, expositions, the, torch, bearing, arm, was, displayed, at, the, centennial, exposition, in, philadelphia, in, 1876, and, in, madison, square, park, in, manhattan, from, 1876, to, 1882, fundraising, proved, difficult, especially, for, the, americans, and, by, 1885, work, on, the, pedestal, was, threatened, by, lack, of, funds, publisher, joseph, pulitzer, of, the, new, york, world, started, a, drive, for, donations, to, finish, the, project, and, attracted, more, than, 120, 000, contributors, most, of, whom, gave, less, than, a, dollar, equivalent, to, 34, in, 2023, the, statue, was, built, in, france, shipped, overseas, in, crates, and, assembled, on, the, completed, pedestal, on, what, was, then, called, bedloe, s, island, the, statue, s, completion, was, marked, by, new, york, s, first, ticker, tape, parade, and, a, dedication, ceremony, presided, over, by, president, grover, cleveland, the, statue, was, administered, by, the, united, states, lighthouse, board, until, 1901, and, then, by, the, department, of, war, since, 1933, it, has, been, maintained, by, the, national, park, service, as, part, of, the, statue, of, liberty, national, monument, and, is, a, major, tourist, attraction, limited, numbers, of, visitors, can, access, the, rim, of, the, pedestal, and, the, interior, of, the, statue, s, crown, from, within, public, access, to, the, torch, has, been, barred, since, 1916, according, to, the, national, park, service, the, idea, of, a, monument, presented, by, the, french, people, to, the, united, states, was, first, proposed, by, douard, ren, de, laboulaye, president, of, the, french, anti, slavery, society, and, a, prominent, and, important, political, thinker, of, his, time, the, project, is, traced, to, a, mid, 1865, conversation, between, laboulaye, a, staunch, abolitionist, and, fr, d, ric, auguste, bartholdi, a, sculptor, in, after, dinner, conversation, at, his, home, near, versailles, laboulaye, an, ardent, supporter, of, the, union, in, the, american, civil, war, is, supposed, to, have, said, if, a, monument, should, rise, in, the, united, states, as, a, memorial, to, their, independence, i, should, think, it, only, natural, if, it, were, built, by, united, effort, a, common, work, of, both, our, nations, the, national, park, service, in, a, 2000, report, however, deemed, this, a, legend, traced, to, an, 1885, fundraising, pamphlet, and, that, the, statue, was, most, likely, conceived, in, 1870, in, another, essay, on, their, website, the, park, service, suggested, that, laboulaye, was, minded, to, honor, the, union, victory, and, its, consequences, with, the, abolition, of, slavery, and, the, union, s, victory, in, the, civil, war, in, 1865, laboulaye, s, wishes, of, freedom, and, democracy, were, turning, into, a, reality, in, the, united, states, in, order, to, honor, these, achievements, laboulaye, proposed, that, a, gift, be, built, for, the, united, states, on, behalf, of, france, laboulaye, hoped, that, by, calling, attention, to, the, recent, achievements, of, the, united, states, the, french, people, would, be, inspired, to, call, for, their, own, democracy, in, the, face, of, a, repressive, monarchy, according, to, sculptor, bartholdi, who, later, recounted, the, story, laboulaye, s, alleged, comment, was, not, intended, as, a, proposal, but, it, inspired, bartholdi, given, the, repressive, nature, of, the, regime, of, napoleon, iii, bartholdi, took, no, immediate, action, on, the, idea, except, to, discuss, it, with, laboulaye, bartholdi, was, in, any, event, busy, with, other, possible, projects, in, 1856, he, traveled, to, egypt, to, study, ancient, works, in, the, late, 1860s, he, approached, isma, il, pasha, khedive, of, egypt, with, a, plan, to, build, progress, or, egypt, carrying, the, light, to, asia, a, huge, lighthouse, in, the, form, of, an, ancient, egyptian, female, fellah, or, peasant, robed, and, holding, a, torch, aloft, at, the, northern, entrance, to, the, suez, canal, in, port, said, sketches, and, models, were, made, of, the, proposed, work, though, it, was, never, erected, there, was, a, classical, precedent, for, the, suez, proposal, the, colossus, of, rhodes, an, ancient, bronze, statue, of, the, greek, god, of, the, sun, helios, this, statue, is, believed, to, have, been, over, 100, feet, 30, m, high, and, it, similarly, stood, at, a, harbor, entrance, and, carried, a, light, to, guide, ships, both, the, khedive, and, ferdinand, de, lesseps, developer, of, the, suez, canal, declined, the, proposed, statue, from, bartholdi, citing, the, high, cost, the, port, said, lighthouse, was, built, instead, by, fran, ois, coignet, in, 1869, upon, his, return, from, egypt, bartholdi, visited, a, 76, foot, giovanni, battista, crespi, s, sculpture, in, repouss, copper, covering, an, iron, armature, at, lago, maggiore, in, italy, and, was, familiar, with, the, similar, construction, of, the, vercing, torix, monument, by, aim, millet, the, restoration, of, millet, s, statue, a, century, later, called, international, attention, to, the, statue, of, liberty, s, poor, state, copper, was, chosen, over, bronze, or, stone, due, to, its, lower, cost, weight, and, ease, of, transportation, any, large, project, was, further, delayed, by, the, franco, prussian, war, in, which, bartholdi, served, as, a, major, of, militia, in, the, war, napoleon, iii, was, captured, and, deposed, bartholdi, s, home, province, of, alsace, was, lost, to, the, prussians, and, a, more, liberal, republic, was, installed, in, france, as, bartholdi, had, been, planning, a, trip, to, the, united, states, he, and, laboulaye, decided, the, time, was, right, to, discuss, the, idea, with, influential, americans, in, june, 1871, bartholdi, crossed, the, atlantic, with, letters, of, introduction, signed, by, laboulaye, arriving, at, new, york, harbor, bartholdi, focused, on, bedloe, s, island, now, named, liberty, island, as, a, site, for, the, statue, struck, by, the, fact, that, vessels, arriving, in, new, york, had, to, sail, past, it, he, was, delighted, to, learn, that, the, island, was, owned, by, the, united, states, government, it, had, been, ceded, by, the, new, york, state, legislature, in, 1800, for, harbor, defense, it, was, thus, as, he, put, it, in, a, letter, to, laboulaye, land, common, to, all, the, states, as, well, as, meeting, many, influential, new, yorkers, bartholdi, visited, president, ulysses, s, grant, who, assured, him, that, it, would, not, be, difficult, to, obtain, the, site, for, the, statue, bartholdi, crossed, the, united, states, twice, by, rail, and, met, many, americans, whom, he, thought, would, be, sympathetic, to, the, project, but, he, remained, concerned, that, popular, opinion, on, both, sides, of, the, atlantic, was, insufficiently, supportive, of, the, proposal, and, he, and, laboulaye, decided, to, wait, before, mounting, a, public, campaign, bartholdi, had, made, a, first, model, of, his, concept, in, 1870, the, son, of, a, friend, of, bartholdi, s, artist, john, lafarge, later, maintained, that, bartholdi, made, the, first, sketches, for, the, statue, during, his, visit, to, la, farge, s, rhode, island, studio, bartholdi, continued, to, develop, the, concept, following, his, return, to, france, he, also, worked, on, a, number, of, sculptures, designed, to, bolster, french, patriotism, after, the, defeat, by, the, prussians, one, of, these, was, the, lion, of, belfort, a, monumental, sculpture, carved, in, sandstone, below, the, fortress, of, belfort, which, during, the, war, had, resisted, a, prussian, siege, for, over, three, months, the, defiant, lion, 73, feet, 22, m, long, and, half, that, in, height, displays, an, emotional, quality, characteristic, of, romanticism, which, bartholdi, would, later, bring, to, the, statue, of, liberty, bartholdi, and, laboulaye, considered, how, best, to, express, the, idea, of, american, liberty, in, early, american, history, two, female, figures, were, frequently, used, as, cultural, symbols, of, the, nation, one, of, these, symbols, the, personified, columbia, was, seen, as, an, embodiment, of, the, united, states, in, the, manner, that, britannia, was, identified, with, the, united, kingdom, and, marianne, came, to, represent, france, columbia, had, supplanted, the, traditional, european, personification, of, the, americas, as, an, indian, princess, which, had, come, to, be, regarded, as, uncivilized, and, derogatory, toward, americans, the, other, significant, female, icon, in, american, culture, was, a, representation, of, liberty, derived, from, libertas, the, goddess, of, freedom, widely, worshipped, in, ancient, rome, especially, among, emancipated, slaves, a, liberty, figure, adorned, most, american, coins, of, the, time, and, representations, of, liberty, appeared, in, popular, and, civic, art, including, thomas, crawford, s, statue, of, freedom, 1863, atop, the, dome, of, the, united, states, capitol, building, the, statue, s, design, evokes, iconography, evident, in, ancient, history, including, the, egyptian, goddess, isis, the, ancient, greek, deity, of, the, same, name, the, roman, columbia, and, the, christian, iconography, of, the, virgin, mary, artists, of, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, striving, to, evoke, republican, ideals, commonly, used, representations, of, libertas, as, an, allegorical, symbol, a, figure, of, liberty, was, also, depicted, on, the, great, seal, of, france, however, bartholdi, and, laboulaye, avoided, an, image, of, revolutionary, liberty, such, as, that, depicted, in, eug, ne, delacroix, s, famed, liberty, leading, the, people, 1830, in, this, painting, which, commemorates, france, s, july, revolution, a, half, clothed, liberty, leads, an, armed, mob, over, the, bodies, of, the, fallen, laboulaye, had, no, sympathy, for, revolution, and, so, bartholdi, s, figure, would, be, fully, dressed, in, flowing, robes, instead, of, the, impression, of, violence, in, the, delacroix, work, bartholdi, wished, to, give, the, statue, a, peaceful, appearance, and, chose, a, torch, representing, progress, for, the, figure, to, hold, its, second, toe, on, both, feet, is, longer, than, its, big, toe, a, condition, known, as, morton, s, toe, or, greek, foot, this, was, an, aesthetic, staple, of, ancient, greek, art, and, reflects, the, classical, influences, on, the, statue, crawford, s, statue, was, designed, in, the, early, 1850s, it, was, originally, to, be, crowned, with, a, pileus, or, liberty, cap, the, cap, given, to, emancipated, slaves, in, ancient, rome, secretary, of, war, jefferson, davis, a, southerner, who, would, later, serve, as, president, of, the, confederate, states, of, america, was, concerned, that, the, pileus, would, be, taken, as, an, abolitionist, symbol, he, ordered, that, it, be, changed, to, a, helmet, delacroix, s, figure, wears, a, pileus, and, bartholdi, at, first, considered, placing, one, on, his, figure, as, well, instead, he, used, a, radiate, halo, nimbus, to, top, its, head, in, so, doing, he, avoided, a, reference, to, marianne, who, invariably, wears, a, pileus, many, believed, they, evoke, the, sun, the, seven, seas, and, the, seven, continents, and, represent, another, means, besides, the, torch, whereby, liberty, enlightens, the, world, but, research, has, not, confirmed, this, bartholdi, s, early, models, were, all, similar, in, concept, a, female, figure, in, neoclassical, style, representing, liberty, wearing, a, stola, and, pella, gown, and, cloak, common, in, depictions, of, roman, goddesses, and, holding, a, torch, aloft, according, to, popular, accounts, the, face, was, modeled, after, that, of, augusta, charlotte, beysser, bartholdi, the, sculptor, s, mother, but, regis, huber, the, curator, of, the, bartholdi, museum, is, on, record, as, saying, that, this, as, well, as, other, similar, speculations, have, no, basis, in, fact, he, designed, the, figure, with, austere, face, and, a, strong, uncomplicated, silhouette, which, would, be, set, off, well, by, its, dramatic, harbor, placement, and, allow, passengers, on, vessels, entering, new, york, bay, to, experience, a, changing, perspective, on, the, statue, as, they, proceeded, toward, manhattan, he, gave, it, bold, classical, contours, and, applied, simplified, modeling, reflecting, the, huge, scale, of, the, project, and, its, solemn, purpose, bartholdi, wrote, of, his, technique, the, surfaces, should, be, broad, and, simple, defined, by, a, bold, and, clear, design, accentuated, in, the, important, places, the, enlargement, of, the, details, or, their, multiplicity, is, to, be, feared, by, exaggerating, the, forms, in, order, to, render, them, more, clearly, visible, or, by, enriching, them, with, details, we, would, destroy, the, proportion, of, the, work, finally, the, model, like, the, design, should, have, a, summarized, character, such, as, one, would, give, to, a, rapid, sketch, only, it, is, necessary, that, this, character, should, be, the, product, of, volition, and, study, and, that, the, artist, concentrating, his, knowledge, should, find, the, form, and, the, line, in, its, greatest, simplicity, bartholdi, made, alterations, in, the, design, as, the, project, evolved, bartholdi, considered, having, liberty, hold, a, broken, chain, but, decided, this, would, be, too, divisive, in, the, days, after, the, civil, war, the, erected, statue, does, stride, over, a, broken, chain, half, hidden, by, her, robes, and, difficult, to, see, from, the, ground, her, right, foot, is, raised, and, set, back, in, a, classical, contrapposto, pose, that, looks, stationary, when, viewed, from, the, front, but, dynamic, when, viewed, from, the, side, signifying, a, solid, footing, and, a, posture, more, relaxed, than, that, of, two, feet, set, side, by, side, and, introducing, a, sense, of, tension, between, standing, and, moving, forward, both, physically, and, mentally, the, upright, form, and, outstretched, leg, may, have, also, helped, to, stabilize, the, statue, bartholdi, was, initially, uncertain, of, what, to, place, in, liberty, s, left, hand, he, settled, on, a, tabula, ansata, used, to, evoke, the, concept, of, law, though, bartholdi, greatly, admired, the, united, states, constitution, he, chose, to, inscribe, july, iv, mdcclxxvi, on, the, tablet, thus, associating, the, date, of, the, country, s, declaration, of, independence, with, the, concept, of, liberty, bartholdi, interested, his, friend, and, mentor, architect, eug, ne, viollet, le, duc, in, the, project, as, chief, engineer, viollet, le, duc, proposed, designing, a, brick, pier, filled, with, sand, within, the, statue, up, to, the, hips, with, iron, bars, like, veins, of, a, leaf, to, which, the, skin, would, be, anchored, after, consultations, with, the, metalwork, foundry, gaget, gauthier, co, viollet, le, duc, chose, the, metal, which, would, be, used, for, the, skin, copper, sheets, and, the, method, used, to, shape, it, repouss, in, which, the, sheets, were, heated, and, then, struck, with, wooden, hammers, an, advantage, of, this, choice, was, that, the, entire, statue, would, be, light, for, its, volume, as, the, copper, need, be, only, 0, 094, inches, 2, 4, mm, thick, bartholdi, had, decided, on, a, height, of, just, over, 151, feet, 46, m, for, the, statue, double, that, of, italy, s, sancarlone, and, the, german, statue, of, arminius, both, made, with, the, same, method, by, 1875, france, was, enjoying, improved, political, stability, and, a, recovering, postwar, economy, growing, interest, in, the, upcoming, centennial, exposition, to, be, held, in, philadelphia, led, laboulaye, to, decide, it, was, time, to, seek, public, support, in, september, 1875, he, announced, the, project, and, the, formation, of, the, franco, american, union, as, its, fundraising, arm, with, the, announcement, the, statue, was, given, a, name, liberty, enlightening, the, world, the, french, people, were, to, finance, the, statue, contrary, to, the, common, misconception, of, it, being, funded, by, the, french, national, government, and, americans, would, be, expected, to, pay, for, the, pedestal, the, announcement, provoked, a, generally, favorable, reaction, in, france, though, many, frenchmen, resented, the, united, states, for, not, coming, to, their, aid, during, the, war, with, prussia, french, monarchists, opposed, the, statue, if, for, no, other, reason, than, it, was, proposed, by, the, liberal, laboulaye, who, had, recently, been, elected, a, senator, for, life, laboulaye, arranged, events, designed, to, appeal, to, the, rich, and, powerful, including, a, special, performance, at, the, paris, opera, on, april, 25, 1876, that, featured, a, new, cantata, by, the, composer, charles, gounod, the, piece, was, titled, la, libert, clairant, le, monde, the, french, version, of, the, statue, s, announced, name, initially, focused, on, the, elites, the, union, was, successful, in, raising, funds, from, across, french, society, schoolchildren, and, ordinary, citizens, gave, as, did, 181, french, municipalities, laboulaye, s, political, allies, supported, the, call, as, did, descendants, of, the, french, contingent, in, the, american, revolutionary, war, less, idealistically, contributions, came, from, those, who, hoped, for, american, support, in, the, french, attempt, to, build, the, panama, canal, the, copper, may, have, come, from, multiple, sources, and, some, of, it, is, said, to, have, come, from, a, mine, in, visnes, norway, though, this, has, not, been, conclusively, determined, after, testing, samples, according, to, cara, sutherland, in, her, book, on, the, statue, for, the, museum, of, the, city, of, new, york, 200, 000, pounds, 91, 000, kg, was, needed, to, build, the, statue, and, the, french, copper, industrialist, eug, ne, secr, tan, donated, 128, 000, pounds, 58, 000, kg, of, copper, although, plans, for, the, statue, had, not, been, finalized, bartholdi, moved, forward, with, fabrication, of, the, right, arm, bearing, the, torch, and, the, head, work, began, at, the, gaget, gauthier, co, workshop, in, may, 1876, bartholdi, traveled, to, the, united, states, as, a, member, of, a, french, delegation, to, the, centennial, exhibition, and, arranged, for, a, huge, painting, of, the, statue, to, be, shown, in, new, york, as, part, of, the, centennial, festivities, the, arm, did, not, arrive, in, philadelphia, until, august, because, of, its, late, arrival, it, was, not, listed, in, the, exhibition, catalogue, and, while, some, reports, correctly, identified, the, work, others, called, it, the, colossal, arm, or, bartholdi, electric, light, the, exhibition, grounds, contained, a, number, of, monumental, artworks, to, compete, for, fairgoers, interest, including, an, outsized, fountain, designed, by, bartholdi, nevertheless, the, arm, proved, popular, in, the, exhibition, s, waning, days, and, visitors, would, climb, up, to, the, balcony, of, the, torch, to, view, the, fairgrounds, after, the, exhibition, closed, the, arm, was, transported, to, new, york, city, where, it, remained, on, display, in, madison, square, park, for, several, years, before, it, was, returned, to, france, to, join, the, rest, of, the, statue, during, his, second, trip, to, the, united, states, bartholdi, addressed, a, number, of, groups, about, the, project, and, urged, the, formation, of, american, committees, of, the, franco, american, union, committees, to, raise, money, to, pay, for, the, foundation, and, pedestal, were, formed, in, new, york, boston, and, philadelphia, the, new, york, group, eventually, took, on, most, of, the, responsibility, for, american, fundraising, and, is, often, referred, to, as, the, american, committee, one, of, its, members, was, 19, year, old, theodore, roosevelt, the, future, governor, of, new, york, and, president, of, the, united, states, on, march, 3, 1877, on, his, final, full, day, in, office, president, grant, signed, a, joint, resolution, that, authorized, the, president, to, accept, the, statue, when, it, was, presented, by, france, and, to, select, a, site, for, it, president, rutherford, b, hayes, who, took, office, the, following, day, selected, the, bedloe, s, island, site, that, bartholdi, had, proposed, on, his, return, to, paris, in, 1877, bartholdi, concentrated, on, completing, the, head, which, was, exhibited, at, the, 1878, paris, world, s, fair, fundraising, continued, with, models, of, the, statue, put, on, sale, tickets, to, view, the, construction, activity, at, the, gaget, gauthier, co, workshop, were, also, offered, the, french, government, authorized, a, lottery, among, the, prizes, were, valuable, silver, plate, and, a, terracotta, model, of, the, statue, by, the, end, of, 1879, about, 250, 000, francs, had, been, raised, the, head, and, arm, had, been, built, with, assistance, from, viollet, le, duc, who, fell, ill, in, 1879, he, soon, died, leaving, no, indication, of, how, he, intended, to, transition, from, the, copper, skin, to, his, proposed, masonry, pier, the, following, year, bartholdi, was, able, to, obtain, the, services, of, the, innovative, designer, and, builder, gustave, eiffel, eiffel, and, his, structural, engineer, maurice, koechlin, decided, to, abandon, the, pier, and, instead, build, an, iron, truss, tower, eiffel, opted, not, to, use, a, completely, rigid, structure, which, would, force, stresses, to, accumulate, in, the, skin, and, lead, eventually, to, cracking, a, secondary, skeleton, was, attached, to, the, center, pylon, then, to, enable, the, statue, to, move, slightly, in, the, winds, of, new, york, harbor, and, since, the, metal, would, expand, on, hot, summer, days, he, loosely, connected, the, support, structure, to, the, skin, using, flat, iron, bars, or, springs, which, culminated, in, a, mesh, of, metal, straps, known, as, saddles, that, were, riveted, to, the, skin, providing, firm, support, in, a, labor, intensive, process, each, saddle, had, to, be, crafted, individually, to, prevent, galvanic, corrosion, between, the, copper, skin, and, the, iron, support, structure, eiffel, insulated, the, skin, with, asbestos, impregnated, with, shellac, eiffel, s, design, made, the, statue, one, of, the, earliest, examples, of, curtain, wall, construction, in, which, the, exterior, of, the, structure, is, not, load, bearing, but, is, instead, supported, by, an, interior, framework, he, included, two, interior, spiral, staircases, to, make, it, easier, for, visitors, to, reach, the, observation, point, in, the, crown, access, to, an, observation, platform, surrounding, the, torch, was, also, provided, but, the, narrowness, of, the, arm, allowed, for, only, a, single, ladder, 40, feet, 12, m, long, as, the, pylon, tower, arose, eiffel, and, bartholdi, coordinated, their, work, carefully, so, that, completed, segments, of, skin, would, fit, exactly, on, the, support, structure, the, components, of, the, pylon, tower, were, built, in, the, eiffel, factory, in, the, nearby, parisian, suburb, of, levallois, perret, the, change, in, structural, material, from, masonry, to, iron, allowed, bartholdi, to, change, his, plans, for, the, statue, s, assembly, he, had, originally, expected, to, assemble, the, skin, on, site, as, the, masonry, pier, was, built, instead, he, decided, to, build, the, statue, in, france, and, have, it, disassembled, and, transported, to, the, united, states, for, reassembly, in, place, on, bedloe, s, island, in, a, symbolic, act, the, first, rivet, placed, into, the, skin, fixing, a, copper, plate, onto, the, statue, s, big, toe, was, driven, by, united, states, ambassador, to, france, levi, p, morton, the, skin, was, not, however, crafted, in, exact, sequence, from, low, to, high, work, proceeded, on, a, number, of, segments, simultaneously, in, a, manner, often, confusing, to, visitors, some, work, was, performed, by, contractors, one, of, the, fingers, was, made, to, bartholdi, s, exacting, specifications, by, a, coppersmith, in, the, southern, french, town, of, montauban, by, 1882, the, statue, was, complete, up, to, the, waist, an, event, bartholdi, celebrated, by, inviting, reporters, to, lunch, on, a, platform, built, within, the, statue, laboulaye, died, in, 1883, he, was, succeeded, as, chairman, of, the, french, committee, by, lesseps, the, completed, statue, was, formally, presented, to, ambassador, morton, at, a, ceremony, in, paris, on, july, 4, 1884, and, lesseps, announced, that, the, french, government, had, agreed, to, pay, for, its, transport, to, new, york, the, statue, remained, intact, in, paris, pending, sufficient, progress, on, the, pedestal, by, january, 1885, this, had, occurred, and, the, statue, was, disassembled, and, crated, for, its, ocean, voyage, the, committees, in, the, united, states, faced, great, difficulties, in, obtaining, funds, for, the, construction, of, the, pedestal, the, panic, of, 1873, had, led, to, an, economic, depression, that, persisted, through, much, of, the, decade, the, liberty, statue, project, was, not, the, only, such, undertaking, that, had, difficulty, raising, money, construction, of, the, obelisk, later, known, as, the, washington, monument, sometimes, stalled, for, years, it, would, ultimately, take, over, three, and, a, half, decades, to, complete, there, was, criticism, both, of, bartholdi, s, statue, and, of, the, fact, that, the, gift, required, americans, to, foot, the, bill, for, the, pedestal, in, the, years, following, the, civil, war, most, americans, preferred, realistic, artworks, depicting, heroes, and, events, from, the, nation, s, history, rather, than, allegorical, works, like, the, liberty, statue, there, was, also, a, feeling, that, americans, should, design, american, public, works, the, selection, of, italian, born, constantino, brumidi, to, decorate, the, capitol, had, provoked, intense, criticism, even, though, he, was, a, naturalized, u, s, citizen, harper, s, weekly, declared, its, wish, that, m, bartholdi, and, our, french, cousins, had, gone, the, whole, figure, while, they, were, about, it, and, given, us, statue, and, pedestal, at, once, the, new, york, times, stated, that, no, true, patriot, can, countenance, any, such, expenditures, for, bronze, females, in, the, present, state, of, our, finances, faced, with, these, criticisms, the, american, committees, took, little, action, for, several, years, the, foundation, of, bartholdi, s, statue, was, to, be, laid, inside, fort, wood, a, disused, army, base, on, bedloe, s, island, constructed, between, 1807, and, 1811, since, 1823, it, had, rarely, been, used, though, during, the, civil, war, it, had, served, as, a, recruiting, station, the, fortifications, of, the, structure, were, in, the, shape, of, an, eleven, point, star, the, statue, s, foundation, and, pedestal, were, aligned, so, that, it, would, face, southeast, greeting, ships, entering, the, harbor, from, the, atlantic, ocean, in, 1881, the, new, york, committee, commissioned, richard, morris, hunt, to, design, the, pedestal, within, months, hunt, submitted, a, detailed, plan, indicating, that, he, expected, construction, to, take, about, nine, months, he, proposed, a, pedestal, 114, feet, 35, m, in, height, faced, with, money, problems, the, committee, reduced, that, to, 89, feet, 27, m, hunt, s, pedestal, design, contains, elements, of, classical, architecture, including, doric, portals, as, well, as, some, elements, influenced, by, aztec, architecture, the, large, mass, is, fragmented, with, architectural, detail, in, order, to, focus, attention, on, the, statue, in, form, it, is, a, truncated, pyramid, 62, feet, 19, m, square, at, the, base, and, 39, 4, feet, 12, 0, m, at, the, top, the, four, sides, are, identical, in, appearance, above, the, door, on, each, side, there, are, ten, disks, upon, which, bartholdi, proposed, to, place, the, coats, of, arms, of, the, states, between, 1876, and, 1889, there, were, 38, of, them, although, this, was, not, done, above, that, a, balcony, was, placed, on, each, side, framed, by, pillars, bartholdi, placed, an, observation, platform, near, the, top, of, the, pedestal, above, which, the, statue, itself, rises, according, to, author, louis, auchincloss, the, pedestal, craggily, evokes, the, power, of, an, ancient, europe, over, which, rises, the, dominating, figure, of, the, statue, of, liberty, the, committee, hired, former, army, general, charles, pomeroy, stone, to, oversee, the, construction, work, construction, on, the, 15, foot, deep, 4, 6, m, foundation, began, in, 1883, and, the, pedestal, s, cornerstone, was, laid, in, 1884, in, hunt, s, original, conception, the, pedestal, was, to, have, been, made, of, solid, granite, financial, concerns, again, forced, him, to, revise, his, plans, the, final, design, called, for, poured, concrete, walls, up, to, 20, feet, 6, 1, m, thick, faced, with, granite, blocks, this, stony, creek, granite, came, from, the, beattie, quarry, in, branford, connecticut, the, concrete, mass, was, the, largest, poured, to, that, time, norwegian, immigrant, civil, engineer, joachim, goschen, gi, ver, designed, the, structural, framework, for, the, statue, of, liberty, his, work, involved, design, computations, detailed, fabrication, and, construction, drawings, and, oversight, of, construction, in, completing, his, engineering, for, the, statue, s, frame, gi, ver, worked, from, drawings, and, sketches, produced, by, gustave, eiffel, fundraising, in, the, u, s, for, the, pedestal, had, begun, in, 1882, the, committee, organized, a, large, number, of, money, raising, events, as, part, of, one, such, effort, an, auction, of, art, and, manuscripts, poet, emma, lazarus, was, asked, to, donate, an, original, work, she, initially, declined, stating, she, could, not, write, a, poem, about, a, statue, at, the, time, she, was, also, involved, in, aiding, refugees, to, new, york, who, had, fled, antisemitic, pogroms, in, eastern, europe, these, refugees, were, forced, to, live, in, conditions, that, the, wealthy, lazarus, had, never, experienced, she, saw, a, way, to, express, her, empathy, for, these, refugees, in, terms, of, the, statue, the, resulting, sonnet, the, new, colossus, including, the, lines, give, me, your, tired, your, poor, your, huddled, masses, yearning, to, breathe, free, is, uniquely, identified, with, the, statue, of, liberty, in, american, culture, and, is, inscribed, on, a, plaque, in, its, museum, lazarus, s, poem, contrasted, the, classical, colossus, of, rhodes, as, a, frightening, symbol, with, the, new, american, colossus, as, a, beacon, to, the, lost, and, hopeless, even, with, these, efforts, fundraising, lagged, grover, cleveland, the, governor, of, new, york, vetoed, a, bill, to, provide, 50, 000, for, the, statue, project, in, 1884, an, attempt, the, next, year, to, have, congress, provide, 100, 000, sufficient, to, complete, the, project, also, failed, the, new, york, committee, with, only, 3, 000, in, the, bank, suspended, work, on, the, pedestal, with, the, project, in, jeopardy, groups, from, other, american, cities, including, boston, and, philadelphia, offered, to, pay, the, full, cost, of, erecting, the, statue, in, return, for, relocating, it, joseph, pulitzer, publisher, of, the, new, york, world, a, new, york, newspaper, announced, a, drive, to, raise, 100, 000, equivalent, to, 3, 391, 000, in, 2023, pulitzer, pledged, to, print, the, name, of, every, contributor, no, matter, how, small, the, amount, given, the, drive, captured, the, imagination, of, new, yorkers, especially, when, pulitzer,

2023, even, with, the, success, of, the, fund, drive, the, pedestal, was, not, completed, until, april, 1886, immediately, thereafter, reassembly, of, the, statue, began, eiffel, s, iron, framework, was, anchored, to, steel, i, beams, within, the, concrete, pedestal, and, assembled, once, this, was, done, the, sections, of, skin, were, carefully, attached, due, to, the, width, of, the, pedestal, it, was, not, possible, to, erect, scaffolding, and, workers, dangled, from, ropes, while, installing, the, skin, sections, bartholdi, had, planned, to, put, floodlights, on, the, torch, s, balcony, to, illuminate, it, a, week, before, the, dedication, the, army, corps, of, engineers, vetoed, the, proposal, fearing, that, ships, pilots, passing, the, statue, would, be, blinded, instead, bartholdi, cut, portholes, in, the, torch, which, was, covered, with, gold, leaf, and, placed, the, lights, inside, them, a, power, plant, was, installed, on, the, island, to, light, the, torch, and, for, other, electrical, needs, after, the, skin, was, completed, landscape, architect, frederick, law, olmsted, co, designer, of, manhattan, s, central, park, and, brooklyn, s, prospect, park, supervised, a, cleanup, of, bedloe, s, island, in, anticipation, of, the, dedication, general, charles, stone, claimed, on, the, day, of, dedication, that, no, man, had, died, during, the, construction, of, the, statue, this, was, not, true, as, francis, longo, a, thirty, nine, year, old, italian, laborer, had, been, killed, when, an, old, wall, fell, on, him, when, built, the, statue, was, reddish, brown, and, shiny, but, within, twenty, years, it, had, oxidized, to, its, current, green, color, through, reactions, with, air, water, and, acidic, pollution, forming, a, layer, of, verdigris, which, protects, the, copper, from, further, corrosion, a, ceremony, of, dedication, was, held, on, the, afternoon, of, october, 28, 1886, president, grover, cleveland, the, former, new, york, governor, presided, over, the, event, on, the, morning, of, the, dedication, a, parade, was, held, in, new, york, city, estimates, of, the, number, of, people, who, watched, it, ranged, from, several, hundred, thousand, to, a, million, president, cleveland, headed, the, procession, then, stood, in, the, reviewing, stand, to, see, bands, and, marchers, from, across, america, general, stone, was, the, grand, marshal, of, the, parade, the, route, began, at, madison, square, once, the, venue, for, the, arm, and, proceeded, to, the, battery, at, the, southern, tip, of, manhattan, by, way, of, fifth, avenue, and, broadway, with, a, slight, detour, so, the, parade, could, pass, in, front, of, the, world, building, on, park, row, as, the, parade, passed, the, new, york, stock, exchange, traders, threw, ticker, tape, from, the, windows, beginning, the, new, york, tradition, of, the, ticker, tape, parade, a, nautical, parade, began, at, 12, 45, p, m, and, president, cleveland, embarked, on, a, yacht, that, took, him, across, the, harbor, to, bedloe, s, island, for, the, dedication, lesseps, made, the, first, speech, on, behalf, of, the, french, committee, followed, by, the, chairman, of, the, new, york, committee, senator, william, m, evarts, a, french, flag, draped, across, the, statue, s, face, was, to, be, lowered, to, unveil, the, statue, at, the, close, of, evarts, s, speech, but, bartholdi, mistook, a, pause, as, the, conclusion, and, let, the, flag, fall, prematurely, the, ensuing, cheers, put, an, end, to, evarts, s, address, president, cleveland, spoke, next, stating, that, the, statue, s, stream, of, light, shall, pierce, the, darkness, of, ignorance, and, man, s, oppression, until, liberty, enlightens, the, world, bartholdi, observed, near, the, dais, was, called, upon, to, speak, but, he, declined, orator, chauncey, m, depew, concluded, the, speechmaking, with, a, lengthy, address, no, members, of, the, general, public, were, permitted, on, the, island, during, the, ceremonies, which, were, reserved, entirely, for, dignitaries, the, only, women, granted, access, were, bartholdi, s, wife, and, lesseps, s, granddaughter, officials, stated, that, they, feared, women, might, be, injured, in, the, crush, of, people, the, restriction, offended, area, suffragists, who, chartered, a, boat, and, got, as, close, as, they, could, to, the, island, the, group, s, leaders, made, speeches, applauding, the, embodiment, of, liberty, as, a, woman, and, advocating, women, s, right, to, vote, a, scheduled, fireworks, display, was, postponed, until, november, 1, because, of, poor, weather, shortly, after, the, dedication, the, cleveland, gazette, an, african, american, newspaper, suggested, that, the, statue, s, torch, not, be, lit, until, the, united, states, became, a, free, nation, in, reality, liberty, enlightening, the, world, indeed, the, expression, makes, us, sick, this, government, is, a, howling, farce, it, can, not, or, rather, does, not, protect, its, citizens, within, its, own, borders, shove, the, bartholdi, statue, torch, and, all, into, the, ocean, until, the, liberty, of, this, country, is, such, as, to, make, it, possible, for, an, inoffensive, and, industrious, colored, man, to, earn, a, respectable, living, for, himself, and, family, without, being, ku, kluxed, perhaps, murdered, his, daughter, and, wife, outraged, and, his, property, destroyed, the, idea, of, the, liberty, of, this, country, enlightening, the, world, or, even, patagonia, is, ridiculous, in, the, extreme, when, the, torch, was, illuminated, on, the, evening, of, the, statue, s, dedication, it, produced, only, a, faint, gleam, barely, visible, from, manhattan, the, world, characterized, it, as, more, like, a, glowworm, than, a, beacon, bartholdi, suggested, gilding, the, statue, to, increase, its, ability, to, reflect, light, but, this, proved, too, expensive, the, united, states, lighthouse, board, took, over, the, statue, of, liberty, in, 1887, and, pledged, to, install, equipment, to, enhance, the, torch, s, effect, in, spite, of, its, efforts, the, statue, remained, virtually, invisible, at, night, when, bartholdi, returned, to, the, united, states, in, 1893, he, made, additional, suggestions, all, of, which, proved, ineffective, he, did, successfully, lobby, for, improved, lighting, within, the, statue, allowing, visitors, to, better, appreciate, eiffel, s, design, in, 1901, president, theodore, roosevelt, once, a, member, of, the, new, york, committee, ordered, the, statue, s, transfer, to, the, war, department, as, it, had, proved, useless, as, a, lighthouse, a, unit, of, the, army, signal, corps, was, stationed, on, bedloe, s, island, until, 1923, after, which, military, police, remained, there, while, the, island, was, under, military, jurisdiction, wars, and, other, upheavals, in, europe, prompted, large, scale, emigration, to, the, united, states, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, many, entered, through, new, york, and, saw, the, statue, not, as, a, symbol, of, enlightenment, as, bartholdi, had, intended, but, as, a, sign, of, welcome, to, their, new, home, the, association, with, immigration, only, became, stronger, when, an, immigrant, processing, station, was, opened, on, nearby, ellis, island, this, view, was, consistent, with, lazarus, s, vision, in, her, sonnet, she, described, the, statue, as, mother, of, exiles, but, her, work, had, become, obscure, in, 1903, the, sonnet, was, engraved, on, a, plaque, that, was, affixed, to, the, base, of, the, statue, oral, histories, of, immigrants, record, their, feelings, of, exhilaration, on, first, viewing, the, statue, of, liberty, one, immigrant, who, arrived, from, greece, recalled, i, saw, the, statue, of, liberty, and, i, said, to, myself, lady, you, re, such, a, beautiful, you, opened, your, arms, and, you, get, all, the, foreigners, here, give, me, a, chance, to, prove, that, i, am, worth, it, to, do, something, to, be, someone, in, america, and, always, that, statue, was, on, my, mind, the, statue, rapidly, became, a, landmark, originally, it, was, a, dull, copper, color, but, shortly, after, 1900, a, green, patina, also, called, verdigris, caused, by, the, oxidation, of, the, copper, skin, began, to, spread, as, early, as, 1902, it, was, mentioned, in, the, press, by, 1906, it, had, entirely, covered, the, statue, believing, that, the, patina, was, evidence, of, corrosion, congress, authorized, us, 62, 800, equivalent, to, 2, 130, 000, in, 2023, for, various, repairs, and, to, paint, the, statue, both, inside, and, out, there, was, considerable, public, protest, against, the, proposed, exterior, painting, the, army, corps, of, engineers, studied, the, patina, for, any, ill, effects, to, the, statue, and, concluded, that, it, protected, the, skin, softened, the, outlines, of, the, statue, and, made, it, beautiful, the, statue, was, painted, only, on, the, inside, the, corps, of, engineers, also, installed, an, elevator, to, take, visitors, from, the, base, to, the, top, of, the, pedestal, on, july, 30, 1916, during, world, war, i, german, saboteurs, set, off, a, disastrous, explosion, on, the, black, tom, peninsula, in, jersey, city, new, jersey, in, what, is, now, part, of, liberty, state, park, close, to, bedloe, s, island, carloads, of, dynamite, and, other, explosives, that, were, being, sent, to, russia, for, its, war, efforts, were, detonated, the, statue, sustained, minor, damage, mostly, to, the, torch, bearing, right, arm, and, was, closed, for, ten, days, the, cost, to, repair, the, statue, and, buildings, on, the, island, was, about, 100, 000, equivalent, to, about, 2, 800, 000, in, 2023, the, narrow, ascent, to, the, torch, was, closed, for, public, safety, reasons, and, it, has, remained, closed, ever, since, that, same, year, ralph, pulitzer, who, had, succeeded, his, father, joseph, as, publisher, of, the, world, began, a, drive, to, raise, 30, 000, equivalent, to, 840, 000, in, 2023, for, an, exterior, lighting, system, to, illuminate, the, statue, at, night, he, claimed, over, 80, 000, contributors, but, failed, to, reach, the, goal, the, difference, was, quietly, made, up, by, a, gift, from, a, wealthy, donor, a, fact, that, was, not, revealed, until, 1936, an, underwater, power, cable, brought, electricity, from, the, mainland, and, floodlights, were, placed, along, the, walls, of, fort, wood, gutzon, borglum, who, later, sculpted, mount, rushmore, redesigned, the, torch, replacing, much, of, the, original, copper, with, stained, glass, on, december, 2, 1916, president, woodrow, wilson, pressed, the, telegraph, key, that, turned, on, the, lights, successfully, illuminating, the, statue, after, the, united, states, entered, world, war, i, in, 1917, images, of, the, statue, were, heavily, used, in, both, recruitment, posters, and, the, liberty, bond, drives, that, urged, american, citizens, to, support, the, war, financially, this, impressed, upon, the, public, the, war, s, stated, purpose, to, secure, liberty, and, served, as, a, reminder, that, embattled, france, had, given, the, united, states, the, statue, in, 1924, president, calvin, coolidge, used, his, authority, under, the, antiquities, act, to, declare, the, statue, a, national, monument, a, suicide, occurred, five, years, later, when, a, man, climbed, out, of, one, of, the, windows, in, the, crown, and, jumped, to, his, death, in, 1933, president, franklin, roosevelt, ordered, the, statue, to, be, transferred, to, the, national, park, service, nps, in, 1937, the, nps, gained, jurisdiction, over, the, rest, of, bedloe, s, island, with, the, army, s, departure, the, nps, began, to, transform, the, island, into, a, park, the, works, progress, administration, wpa, demolished, most, of, the, old, buildings, regraded, and, reseeded, the, eastern, end, of, the, island, and, built, granite, steps, for, a, new, public, entrance, to, the, statue, from, its, rear, the, wpa, also, carried, out, restoration, work, within, the, statue, temporarily, removing, the, rays, from, the, statue, s, halo, so, their, rusted, supports, could, be, replaced, rusted, cast, iron, steps, in, the, pedestal, were, replaced, with, new, ones, made, of, reinforced, concrete, the, upper, parts, of, the, stairways, within, the, statue, were, replaced, as, well, copper, sheathing, was, installed, to, prevent, further, damage, from, rainwater, that, had, been, seeping, into, the, pedestal, the, statue, was, closed, to, the, public, from, may, until, december, 1938, during, world, war, ii, the, statue, remained, open, to, visitors, although, it, was, not, illuminated, at, night, due, to, wartime, blackouts, it, was, lit, briefly, on, december, 31, 1943, and, on, d, day, june, 6, 1944, when, its, lights, flashed, dot, dot, dot, dash, the, morse, code, for, v, for, victory, new, powerful, lighting, was, installed, in, 1944, 1945, and, beginning, on, v, e, day, the, statue, was, once, again, illuminated, after, sunset, the, lighting, was, for, only, a, few, hours, each, evening, and, it, was, not, until, 1957, that, the, statue, was, illuminated, every, night, all, night, in, 1946, the, interior, of, the, statue, within, reach, of, visitors, was, coated, with, a, special, plastic, so, that, graffiti, could, be, washed, away, in, 1956, an, act, of, congress, officially, renamed, bedloe, s, island, as, liberty, island, a, change, advocated, by, bartholdi, generations, earlier, the, act, also, mentioned, the, efforts, to, found, an, american, museum, of, immigration, on, the, island, which, backers, took, as, federal, approval, of, the, project, though, the, government, was, slow, to, grant, funds, for, it, nearby, ellis, island, was, made, part, of, the, statue, of, liberty, national, monument, by, the, proclamation, of, president, lyndon, baines, johnson, in, 1965, in,
