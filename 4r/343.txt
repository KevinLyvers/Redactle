plucked, a, horn, is, any, of, a, family, of, musical, instruments, made, of, a, tube, usually, made, of, metal, and, often, curved, in, various, ways, with, one, narrow, end, into, which, the, musician, blows, and, a, wide, end, from, which, sound, emerges, in, horns, unlike, some, other, brass, instruments, such, as, the, trumpet, the, bore, gradually, increases, in, width, through, most, of, its, length, that, is, to, say, it, is, conical, rather, than, cylindrical, in, jazz, and, popular, music, contexts, the, word, may, be, used, loosely, to, refer, to, any, wind, instrument, and, a, section, of, brass, or, woodwind, instruments, or, a, mixture, of, the, two, is, called, a, horn, section, in, these, contexts, variations, include, as, the, name, indicates, people, originally, used, to, blow, on, the, actual, horns, of, animals, before, starting, to, emulate, them, in, metal, or, other, materials, this, original, usage, survives, in, the, shofar, hebrew, a, ram, s, horn, which, plays, an, important, role, in, jewish, religious, rituals, the, genus, of, animal, horn, instruments, to, which, the, shofar, belongs, is, called, keren, in, hebrew, qarnu, in, akkadian, and, keras, in, greek, the, olifant, or, oliphant, an, abbreviation, of, the, french, cor, d, olifant, oliphant, elephant, horn, was, the, name, applied, in, the, middle, ages, to, ivory, hunting, or, signalling, horns, made, from, elephants, tusks, apparently, of, asian, origin, they, reached, europe, from, byzantium, in, the, tenth, or, eleventh, century, and, are, first, mentioned, in, french, literature, in, the, early, 12th, century, in, europe, they, came, to, be, symbols, of, royalty, from, late, antiquity, there, are, mentions, of, alpine, horns, but, the, earliest, secure, description, of, the, wooden, instrument, now, called, an, alphorn, dates, from, the, sixteenth, century, this, description, by, the, naturalist, conrad, gessner, calls, the, instrument, a, lituus, alpinus, and, says, it, is, nearly, eleven, feet, long, made, from, two, pieces, of, wood, slightly, curved, and, hollowed, out, fitted, together, and, skillfully, bound, with, osiers, nevertheless, one, modern, authority, says, that, at, the, time, it, was, a, straight, instrument, eleven, feet, long, and, this, form, persisted, in, austria, until, the, nineteenth, century, the, more, familiar, form, with, an, upturned, bell, was, developed, in, switzerland, in, the, eighteenth, century, the, practice, of, making, these, instruments, in, different, sizes, to, be, played, together, in, part, music, originated, in, 1826, similar, wooden, instruments, used, by, shepherds, for, signalling, are, known, in, romania, by, the, name, bucium, they, are, made, in, straight, hooked, and, s, shaped, forms, in, lengths, between, 1, 5, and, 3, meters, a, variant, of, the, straight, version, is, called, tulnic, metal, instruments, modelled, on, animal, horns, survive, from, as, early, as, the, 10th, century, bc, in, the, form, of, lurer, a, modern, name, devised, by, archaeologists, nearly, fifty, of, these, curved, bronze, horns, have, been, excavated, from, burial, sites, mostly, in, scandinavia, since, the, first, was, discovered, in, 1797, many, are, in, unison, pairs, curved, in, opposite, directions, because, their, makers, left, no, written, histories, their, use, and, manner, of, playing, is, unknown, the, lur, was, likely, known, to, the, etruscans, noted, as, bronze, workers, from, the, 8th, century, bc, who, in, turn, were, credited, by, the, romans, with, the, invention, of, their, horns, and, trumpets, including, long, curved, horns, in, the, form, of, a, letter, c, or, g, depictions, of, these, instruments, are, found, from, the, 5th, century, bc, onward, on, etruscan, funerary, monuments, the, etruscan, name, for, them, is, unknown, but, the, romans, called, them, buccina, and, cornu, the, latter, name, is, the, latin, word, for, horn, and, the, source, of, the, name, of, the, musical, instrument, in, many, romance, languages, french, cor, italian, corno, proven, al, corn, very, old, metal, instruments, similar, in, form, to, both, the, lurer, and, the, cornu, often, also, with, ceremonial, or, military, uses, are, known, on, the, indian, subcontinent, by, a, variety, of, names, ramsinga, ransingha, sringa, ranasringa, sanskrit, for, war, horn, kurudutu, and, kombu, early, metal, horns, were, less, complex, than, modern, horns, by, the, early, 17th, century, there, were, two, main, types, of, hunting, horns, both, designed, to, deal, with, the, problem, of, providing, a, tube, long, enough, to, allow, playing, higher, partials, while, at, the, same, time, allowing, the, instruments, to, be, played, on, horseback, marin, mersenne, calls, these, trompe, made, in, a, crescent, shape, and, the, cor, plusieurs, tours, a, tightly, coiled, instrument, in, spiral, form, the, tightly, coiled, or, spiral, form, of, horn, was, never, very, popular, in, france, but, both, there, and, in, germany, was, usually, called, a, trumpet, in, german, the, word, trumpet, was, usually, qualified, by, italian, or, hunting, to, distinguish, these, coiled, horns, from, the, military, or, courtly, trumpet, though, spiral, trumpets, sometimes, called, trombae, brevae, pitched, in, d, and, played, in, clarino, style, also, existed, the, earliest, surviving, horn, of, the, tightly, spiralled, type, dating, from, about, 1570, is, by, valentin, springer, though, it, is, described, as, early, as, 1511, by, sebastian, virdung, around, the, middle, of, the, seventeenth, century, instruments, began, to, appear, in, the, form, of, brass, tubes, wound, into, a, single, open, hoop, with, a, flared, exit, opening, the, bell, although, these, came, to, be, associated, especially, with, france, the, first, known, example, was, made, in, 1667, by, the, german, maker, starck, in, nuremberg, in, french, they, were, most, often, called, trompe, de, chasse, though, cor, de, chasse, is, also, frequently, found, in, germany, they, came, to, be, called, waldh, rner, because, these, horns, were, intended, to, be, played, on, horseback, during, a, hunt, the, mouthpiece, was, not, removable, it, was, soldered, to, a, mouthpipe, which, in, turn, was, often, soldered, to, the, body, of, the, instrument, and, strengthened, by, a, crosspiece, as, was, also, the, bell, rendering, the, horn, more, solid, the, sound, they, produced, was, called, a, recheat, change, of, pitch, was, effected, entirely, by, the, lips, the, horn, not, being, equipped, with, valves, until, the, 19th, century, without, valves, only, the, notes, within, the, harmonic, series, are, available, since, the, only, notes, available, were, those, on, the, harmonic, series, of, one, of, those, pitches, they, had, no, ability, to, play, in, different, keys, the, remedy, for, this, limitation, was, the, use, of, crooks, i, e, sections, of, tubing, of, differing, length, which, when, inserted, between, the, mouthpiece, and, lead, pipe, increased, the, length, of, the, instrument, and, thus, lowered, its, pitch, the, earliest, surviving, crooked, horn, was, made, by, the, viennese, maker, michael, leichamschneider, and, is, dated, 1721, however, leichamschneider, is, known, to, have, been, making, crooked, horns, as, early, as, 1703, when, he, sold, a, pair, of, great, new, j, gerhorn, equipped, with, four, double, crooks, and, four, tuning, bits, to, the, abbot, of, krems, in, england, the, crooked, horn, appeared, as, early, as, 1704, when, it, was, called, corno, cromatico, or, because, of, its, origin, and, because, it, was, most, often, played, by, german, musicians, in, particular, the, messing, family, who, popularized, the, instrument, in, london, beginning, around, 1730, german, horn, in, cases, where, it, was, necessary, to, specify, the, older, hooped, horn, without, crooks, the, english, called, it, the, french, horn, by, the, second, decade, of, the, eighteenth, century, horns, had, become, regular, members, of, continental, orchestras, in, 1713, johann, mattheson, stated, the, lovely, majestic, hunting, horns, ital, cornette, di, caccia, gall, cors, de, chasse, have, now, become, very, fashionable, in, church, music, just, as, much, as, in, theatre, and, chamber, music, partly, because, they, are, not, so, coarse, as, trumpets, but, also, partly, because, they, can, be, managed, with, greater, facilit, the, most, useful, have, the, same, ambitus, above, f, as, the, trumpets, have, above, c, however, they, sound, more, poetic, and, are, more, satisfying, than, the, deafening, and, shrieking, clarini, because, they, are, a, perfect, fifth, lower, in, pitch, one, performing, difficulty, raised, by, the, use, of, crooks, inserted, at, the, mouthpiece, end, of, the, instrument, was, that, players, were, obliged, to, hold, the, horn, in, a, way, that, the, crooks, would, not, fall, out, for, the, hunting, horn, played, on, horseback, the, left, hand, held, the, reins, while, the, right, hand, gripped, the, body, of, the, horn, but, with, crooks, the, left, hand, was, required, to, hold, them, and, the, instrument, securely, together, with, the, right, hand, grasping, the, bell, or, the, body, of, the, instrument, the, solution, came, with, the, creation, of, the, inventionshorn, in, about, 1753, by, the, famous, horn, player, anton, joseph, hampel, in, collaboration, with, the, dresden, instrument, maker, johann, georg, werner, in, this, type, of, instrument, the, relationship, between, the, mouthpiece, and, lead, pipe, is, usually, undisturbed, and, a, series, of, cylindrical, bore, sliding, crooks, are, fitted, into, the, central, portion, of, the, instrument, to, lower, the, pitch, from, e, downwards, these, sliding, crooks, also, had, the, function, of, tuning, slides, obviating, the, need, for, tuning, bits, inserted, before, or, after, the, crook, in, order, to, raise, the, pitch, above, f, however, it, was, necessary, to, insert, a, new, shorter, lead, pipe, acting, as, a, crook, this, design, was, adapted, and, improved, by, the, parisian, maker, raoux, in, about, 1780, and, adopted, by, many, soloists, in, france, this, was, called, the, cor, solo, and, was, distinguished, by, the, use, of, just, five, crooks, for, playing, in, the, most, common, keys, for, solo, compositions, g, f, e, e, and, d, orchestral, horns, are, traditionally, grouped, into, high, horn, and, low, horn, pairs, players, specialize, to, negotiate, the, unusually, wide, range, required, of, the, instrument, formerly, in, certain, situations, composers, called, for, two, pairs, of, horns, in, two, different, keys, for, example, a, composer, might, call, for, two, horns, in, c, and, two, in, e, for, a, piece, in, c, minor, in, order, to, gain, harmonics, of, the, relative, major, unavailable, on, the, c, horns, eventually, two, pairs, of, horns, became, the, standard, and, from, this, tradition, of, two, independent, pairs, each, with, its, own, high, and, low, horn, came, the, modern, convention, of, writing, both, the, first, and, third, parts, above, the, second, and, fourth, in, the, mid, 18th, century, horn, players, began, to, insert, the, right, hand, into, the, bell, to, change, the, effective, length, of, the, instrument, adjusting, the, tuning, up, to, the, distance, between, two, adjacent, harmonics, depending, on, how, much, of, the, opening, was, covered, this, technique, known, as, hand, stopping, is, generally, credited, to, the, self, same, anton, joseph, hampel, who, created, the, inventionshorn, it, was, first, developed, around, 1750, and, was, refined, and, carried, to, much, of, europe, by, the, influential, giovanni, punto, this, offered, more, possibilities, for, playing, notes, not, on, the, harmonic, series, by, the, early, classical, period, the, horn, had, become, an, instrument, capable, of, much, melodic, playing, a, notable, example, of, this, are, the, four, mozart, horn, concerti, and, concert, rondo, k, 412, 417, 477, 495, 371, wherein, melodic, chromatic, tones, are, used, owing, to, the, growing, prevalence, of, hand, stopping, and, other, newly, emerging, techniques, in, 1818, rotary, valves, were, introduced, by, heinrich, st, lzel, and, friedrich, bl, mel, later, in, 1839, piston, valves, were, applied, to, the, horn, by, fran, ois, p, rinet, initially, to, overcome, problems, associated, with, changing, crooks, during, a, performance, valves, unreliability, musical, taste, and, players, distrust, among, other, reasons, slowed, their, adoption, into, mainstream, many, traditional, conservatories, and, players, refused, to, use, them, at, first, claiming, that, the, valveless, horn, or, natural, horn, was, a, better, instrument, some, musicians, specializing, in, period, instruments, still, use, a, natural, horn, when, playing, in, original, performance, styles, seeking, to, recapture, the, sound, and, tenor, in, which, an, older, piece, was, written, the, use, of, valves, however, opened, up, a, great, deal, more, flexibility, in, playing, in, different, keys, in, effect, the, horn, became, an, entirely, different, instrument, fully, chromatic, for, the, first, time, valves, were, originally, used, primarily, as, a, means, to, play, in, different, keys, without, crooks, not, for, harmonic, playing, that, is, reflected, in, compositions, for, horns, which, only, began, to, include, chromatic, passages, in, the, late, 19th, century, when, valves, were, invented, generally, the, french, made, narrower, bored, horns, with, piston, valves, and, the, germans, made, larger, bored, horns, with, rotary, valves, the, variety, in, horn, history, includes, fingerhole, horns, the, natural, horn, russian, horns, french, horn, vienna, horn, mellophone, marching, horn, and, wagner, tuba, animal, horns, adapted, as, signalling, instruments, were, used, from, prehistoric, times, archaeologists, have, discovered, cow, horns, with, fingerholes, drilled, in, the, side, providing, a, more, complete, musical, scale, dating, from, the, iron, age, this, type, of, rustic, instrument, is, found, down, to, the, present, day, all, over, the, baltic, region, of, europe, and, in, some, parts, of, africa, in, scandinavia, it, is, known, by, many, names, bj, rnhorn, bukkehorn, fingerhorn, lekhorn, l, thorn, prillarhorn, soittotorvi, spelhorn, tjuthorn, tuthorn, vallhorn, and, many, others, in, estonia, it, is, called, sokusarv, and, by, the, bongo, people, mangval, descriptions, in, french, are, found, from, the, thirteenth, to, the, fifteenth, centuries, of, instruments, called, coradoiz, modern, french, cor, doigts, which, are, precursors, of, the, cornett, the, cornett, which, became, one, of, the, most, popular, wind, instruments, of, the, renaissance, and, early, baroque, periods, was, developed, from, the, fingerhole, horn, idea, in, its, most, common, form, it, was, a, gently, curved, instrument, carved, in, two, halves, from, wood, the, pieces, were, then, glued, together, and, wrapped, in, black, leather, hence, the, term, black, cornett, and, a, detachable, mouthpiece, added, another, variant, called, the, mute, cornett, was, turned, from, a, single, piece, of, wood, with, the, mouthpiece, an, integral, part, of, the, instrument, because, the, types, of, wood, used, were, usually, light, in, colour, these, were, sometimes, referred, to, as, white, cornetts, amongst, the, earliest, representations, of, the, cornett, showing, its, characteristic, octagonal, exterior, is, a, carving, in, lincoln, cathedral, from, about, 1260, which, shows, an, angel, apparently, playing, two, cornetti, at, once, the, earliest, use, of, the, name, in, english, is, in, le, morte, d, arthur, from, about, 1400, where, as, in, most, subsequent, sources, it, is, spelled, with, a, single, t, cornet, the, spelling, with, two, ts, is, a, modern, convention, to, avoid, confusion, with, the, nineteenth, century, valved, brass, instrument, of, that, name, though, in, old, french, the, spelling, cornette, is, found, the, name, is, a, diminutive, derived, the, latin, cornu, horn, in, the, sixteenth, century, still, larger, versions, of, the, cornett, were, devised, in, order, to, put, the, fingerholes, within, reach, of, the, human, hand, these, bass, instruments, required, so, many, curves, they, acquired, the, name, serpent, toward, the, end, of, the, eighteenth, century, various, attempts, were, made, to, improve, the, serpent, an, upright, version, built, on, the, pattern, of, the, bassoon, and, made, sometimes, of, wood, sometimes, of, metal, sometimes, a, combination, of, the, two, were, called, bass, horn, or, russian, bassoon, in, the, nineteenth, century, an, all, metal, version, with, larger, tone, holes, closed, by, keywork, was, called, an, ophicleide, from, the, greek, ophis, serpent, kleis, key, keyed, serpent, the, ophicleide, only, remained, in, use, until, the, middle, of, the, nineteenth, century, when, it, was, eclipsed, by, the, superior, valved, brass, instruments, natural, horns, include, a, variety, of, valveless, keyless, instruments, such, as, bugles, posthorns, and, hunting, horns, of, many, different, shapes, one, type, of, hunting, horn, with, relatively, long, tubing, bent, into, a, single, hoop, or, sometimes, a, double, hoop, is, the, ancestor, of, the, modern, orchestral, and, band, horns, beginning, in, the, early, 18th, century, the, player, could, change, key, by, adding, crooks, to, change, the, length, of, tubing, it, is, essentially, a, hunting, horn, with, its, pitch, controlled, by, air, speed, aperture, opening, of, the, lips, through, which, air, passes, and, the, use, of, the, right, hand, moving, in, and, out, of, the, bell, today, it, is, played, as, a, period, instrument, the, natural, horn, can, only, play, from, a, single, harmonic, series, at, a, time, because, there, is, only, one, length, of, tubing, available, to, the, horn, player, a, proficient, player, can, indeed, alter, the, pitch, by, partially, muting, the, bell, with, the, right, hand, thus, enabling, the, player, to, reach, some, notes, that, are, not, part, of, the, instrument, s, natural, harmonic, series, of, course, this, technique, also, affects, the, quality, of, the, tone, in, 1751, prince, narishkin, master, of, the, hunt, to, empress, elizabeth, of, russia, had, a, set, of, sixteen, carefully, tuned, metal, horns, made, to, ensure, that, his, huntsmen, would, sound, a, harmonious, d, major, chord, while, signalling, to, each, other, he, then, got, the, idea, of, enlisting, a, bohemian, horn, player, j, a, mare, who, was, in, service, with, the, imperial, court, in, st, petersburg, to, organize, these, new, horns, into, a, band, maresch, had, made, a, second, set, of, thirty, two, or, perhaps, thirty, seven, horns, each, capable, of, playing, a, different, single, note, the, second, harmonic, of, the, instrument, from, a, c, major, scale, covering, several, octaves, later, the, size, of, the, band, was, increased, to, sixty, horns, encompassing, five, octaves, the, instruments, were, straight, or, slightly, curved, horns, made, of, copper, or, brass, had, a, wide, conical, bore, and, were, played, with, a, cupped, trumpet, type, mouthpiece, a, metal, cap, fixed, to, the, bell, end, was, used, to, adjust, the, tuning, each, man, in, the, band, was, trained, to, play, his, note, in, turn, similar, to, the, way, in, which, a, group, of, handbell, ringers, perform, melodies, by, each, sounding, their, bells, at, a, predetermined, moment, this, horn, band, effectively, a, giant, human, music, box, of, the, sort, only, feasible, in, a, slave, culture, played, its, first, public, concert, in, 1753, or, 1755, and, debuted, officially, at, the, grand, hunt, concert, in, 1757, creating, a, fashion, that, spread, outside, of, russia, and, continued, for, eighty, years, with, proper, training, such, a, horn, ensemble, was, capable, of, playing, relatively, complex, music, in, full, harmony, the, russian, nobility, developed, a, taste, for, horn, bands, which, were, sometimes, sold, as, a, body, the, performers, along, with, horns, since, most, of, the, players, were, serfs, some, bands, toured, europe, and, the, british, isles, playing, arrangements, of, standard, concert, repertory, and, russian, folk, music, as, well, as, original, compositions, although, received, with, praise, for, their, accomplishment, they, were, also, criticized, for, reducing, man, to, the, level, of, a, machine, in, eastern, germany, workmen, s, bands, modified, the, technique, of, these, horns, by, adding, the, upper, octave, to, each, instrument, s, note, and, the, use, of, hand, stopping, for, the, smaller, horns, to, add, one, or, two, lower, semitones, the, german, horn, is, the, most, common, type, of, orchestral, horn, and, is, ordinarily, known, simply, as, the, horn, the, double, horn, in, f, b, is, the, version, most, used, by, professional, bands, and, orchestras, a, musician, who, plays, the, german, horn, is, called, a, horn, player, or, less, frequently, a, hornist, pitch, is, controlled, through, the, adjustment, of, lip, tension, in, the, mouthpiece, and, the, operation, of, valves, by, the, left, hand, which, route, the, air, into, extra, tubing, german, horns, have, lever, operated, rotary, valves, the, backward, facing, orientation, of, the, bell, relates, to, the, perceived, desirability, to, create, a, subdued, sound, in, concert, situations, in, contrast, to, the, more, piercing, quality, of, the, trumpet, three, valves, control, the, flow, of, air, in, the, single, horn, which, is, tuned, to, f, or, less, commonly, b, the, more, common, double, horn, is, found, almost, exclusively, in, the, german, design, only, rarely, in, the, french, horn, and, never, in, the, vienna, horn, it, has, a, fourth, valve, usually, operated, by, the, thumb, which, routes, the, air, to, one, set, of, tubing, tuned, to, f, or, another, tuned, to, b, although, first, developed, by, paxman, a, british, firm, triple, horns, with, five, valves, are, also, of, the, german, horn, type, tuned, in, f, b, and, a, descant, e, or, f, also, common, are, descant, doubles, which, typically, provide, b, and, alto, f, branches, this, configuration, provides, a, high, range, horn, while, avoiding, the, additional, complexity, and, weight, of, a, triple, the, french, horn, as, distinct, from, the, german, and, vienna, horns, is, also, usually, referred, to, simply, as, the, horn, by, orchestral, players, the, bore, of, the, french, horn, is, small, between, 10, 8, and, 11, mm, compared, to, 11, 5, mm, for, the, german, horn, but, not, as, small, as, the, vienna, horn, at, 10, 7, mm, these, narrow, bore, french, instruments, are, equipped, with, piston, valves, also, called, p, rinet, valves, after, their, inventor, unlike, today, s, more, usual, orchestral, german, horns, which, have, rotary, valves, a, musician, who, plays, the, french, horn, like, the, players, of, the, german, and, vienna, horns, confusingly, also, sometimes, called, french, horns, is, called, a, horn, player, or, less, frequently, a, hornist, three, valves, control, the, flow, of, air, in, the, single, horn, which, is, tuned, to, f, or, less, commonly, b, although, double, french, horns, do, exist, they, are, rare, a, crucial, element, in, playing, the, horn, deals, with, the, mouthpiece, most, of, the, time, the, mouthpiece, is, placed, in, the, exact, center, of, the, lips, but, because, of, differences, in, the, formation, of, the, lips, and, teeth, of, different, players, some, tend, to, play, with, the, mouthpiece, slightly, off, center, although, the, exact, side, to, side, placement, of, the, mouthpiece, varies, for, most, horn, players, the, up, and, down, placement, of, the, mouthpiece, is, generally, two, thirds, on, the, upper, lip, and, one, third, on, the, lower, lip, usually, in, order, to, play, higher, octave, notes, the, pressure, exerted, on, the, lips, from, the, mouthpiece, is, increased, but, although, some, pressure, is, needed, excessive, pressure, is, not, desirable, playing, with, excessive, pressure, makes, the, playing, of, the, horn, sound, forced, and, harsh, as, well, as, decreases, endurance, of, the, player, by, about, half, the, vienna, horn, is, a, special, horn, used, primarily, in, vienna, austria, instead, of, using, rotary, valves, or, piston, valves, it, uses, the, pumpenvalve, or, vienna, valve, which, is, a, double, piston, operating, inside, the, valve, slides, and, usually, situated, on, the, opposite, side, of, the, corpus, from, the, player, s, left, hand, and, operated, by, a, long, pushrod, unlike, the, modern, horn, which, has, grown, considerably, larger, internally, for, a, bigger, broader, and, louder, tone, and, considerably, heavier, with, the, addition, of, valves, and, tubing, in, the, case, of, the, double, horn, the, vienna, horn, very, closely, mimics, the, size, and, weight, of, the, natural, horn, although, the, valves, do, add, some, weight, they, are, lighter, than, rotary, valves, even, using, crooks, in, the, front, of, the, horn, between, the, mouthpiece, and, the, instrument, although, instead, of, the, full, range, of, keys, vienna, horn, players, usually, use, an, f, crook, and, it, is, looked, down, upon, to, use, others, though, switching, to, an, a, or, b, crook, for, higher, pitched, music, does, happen, on, occasion, vienna, horns, are, often, used, with, funnel, shaped, mouthpieces, similar, to, those, used, on, the, natural, horn, with, very, little, if, any, backbore, and, a, very, thin, rim, the, viennese, horn, requires, very, specialized, technique, and, can, be, quite, challenging, to, play, even, for, accomplished, players, of, modern, horns, the, vienna, horn, has, a, warmer, softer, sound, than, the, modern, horn, its, pumpen, valves, facilitate, a, continuous, transition, between, notes, glissando, conversely, a, more, precise, operating, of, the, valves, is, required, to, avoid, notes, that, sound, out, of, tune, two, instruments, are, called, a, mellophone, the, first, is, an, instrument, shaped, somewhat, like, a, horn, in, that, it, is, formed, in, a, circle, it, has, piston, valves, and, is, played, with, the, right, hand, on, the, valves, manufacturing, of, this, instrument, sharply, decreased, in, the, middle, of, the, twentieth, century, and, this, mellophone, or, mellophonium, rarely, appears, today, the, second, instrument, is, used, in, modern, brass, bands, and, marching, bands, and, is, more, accurately, called, a, marching, mellophone, or, mellophone, a, derivative, of, the, f, alto, horn, it, is, keyed, in, f, it, is, shaped, like, a, flugelhorn, with, piston, valves, played, with, the, right, hand, and, a, forward, pointing, bell, these, horns, are, generally, considered, better, marching, instruments, than, regular, horns, because, their, position, is, more, stable, on, the, mouth, they, project, better, and, they, weigh, less, it, is, primarily, used, as, the, middle, voice, of, drum, and, bugle, corps, though, they, are, usually, played, with, a, v, cup, cornet, like, mouthpiece, their, range, overlaps, the, common, playing, range, of, the, horn, this, mouthpiece, switch, makes, the, mellophone, louder, less, mellow, and, more, brassy, and, brilliant, making, it, more, appropriate, for, marching, bands, as, they, are, pitched, in, f, or, g, and, their, range, overlaps, that, of, the, horn, mellophones, can, be, used, in, place, of, the, horn, in, brass, and, marching, band, settings, mellophones, are, however, sometimes, unpopular, with, horn, players, because, the, mouthpiece, change, can, be, difficult, and, requires, a, different, embouchure, mouthpiece, adapters, are, available, so, that, a, horn, mouthpiece, can, fit, into, the, mellophone, lead, pipe, but, this, does, not, compensate, for, the, many, differences, that, a, horn, player, must, adapt, to, the, bore, is, generally, cylindrical, as, opposed, to, the, more, conical, horn, thus, the, feel, of, the, mellophone, can, be, foreign, to, a, horn, player, another, unfamiliar, aspect, of, the, mellophone, is, that, it, is, designed, to, be, played, with, the, right, hand, instead, of, the, left, although, it, can, be, played, with, the, left, while, horn, players, may, be, asked, to, play, the, mellophone, it, is, unlikely, that, the, instrument, was, ever, intended, as, a, substitute, for, the, horn, mainly, because, of, the, fundamental, differences, described, as, an, instrument, it, compromises, between, the, ability, to, sound, like, a, horn, while, being, used, like, a, trumpet, or, flugelhorn, a, tradeoff, that, sacrifices, acoustic, properties, for, ergonomics, the, marching, horn, is, quite, similar, to, the, mellophone, in, shape, and, appearance, but, is, pitched, in, the, key, of, b, the, same, as, the, b, side, of, a, regular, double, horn, it, is, also, available, in, f, alto, one, octave, above, the, f, side, of, a, regular, double, horn, the, marching, horn, is, also, normally, played, with, a, horn, mouthpiece, unlike, the, mellophone, which, needs, an, adapter, to, fit, the, horn, mouthpiece, these, instruments, are, primarily, used, in, marching, bands, so, that, the, sound, comes, from, a, forward, facing, bell, as, dissipation, of, the, sound, from, the, backward, facing, bell, becomes, a, concern, in, open, air, environments, many, college, marching, bands, and, drum, corps, however, use, mellophones, instead, which, with, many, marching, bands, better, balance, the, tone, of, the, other, brass, instruments, additionally, mellophones, require, less, special, training, of, trumpet, players, who, considerably, outnumber, horn, players, the, saxhorns, constitute, a, family, of, brass, instruments, with, tapered, bores, pitched, in, eight, alternating, sizes, in, e, flat, and, b, flat, like, saxophones, they, were, originally, designed, for, army, use, and, revolutionized, military, and, brass, bands, in, europe, and, america, developed, during, the, 1840s, and, 50s, the, saxhorn, was, first, patented, in, paris, in, 1845, by, adolphe, sax, though, the, validity, of, his, patents, was, challenged, by, rival, instrument, makers, during, his, lifetime, throughout, the, mid, 1850s, he, continued, to, experiment, with, the, instrument, s, valve, pattern, later, makers, particularly, in, america, altered, the, scale, and, designs, sometimes, to, such, an, extent, as, to, make, it, difficult, to, determine, whether, the, larger, sizes, of, the, resulting, instruments, actually, have, descended, from, the, saxhorn, or, the, tuba, the, tenor, and, baritone, horns, amongst, other, sizes, of, instruments, used, in, british, brass, bands, are, members, of, the, saxhorn, family, the, wagner, tuba, is, a, rare, brass, instrument, that, is, essentially, a, horn, modified, to, have, a, larger, bell, throat, and, a, vertical, bell, despite, its, name, it, is, generally, not, considered, part, of, the, tuba, family, invented, for, richard, wagner, specifically, for, his, work, der, ring, des, nibelungen, it, has, since, been, written, for, by, various, other, composers, including, bruckner, stravinsky, and, richard, strauss, it, uses, a, horn, mouthpiece, and, is, available, as, a, single, tuba, in, b, or, f, or, more, recently, as, a, double, tuba, similar, to, the, double, horn, its, common, range, is, similar, to, that, of, the, euphonium, but, its, possible, range, is, the, same, as, that, of, the, horn, extending, from, low, f, below, the, bass, clef, staff, to, high, c, above, the, treble, staff, when, read, in, f, these, low, pedals, are, substantially, easier, to, play, on, the, wagner, tuba, than, on, the, horn, amongst, the, first, written, records, of, horn, music, are, hunting, horn, signals, which, date, back, to, the, fourteenth, century, the, earliest, of, these, is, the, art, of, hunting, 1327, by, william, twiti, who, uses, syllables, such, as, moot, trout, and, trourourout, to, describe, a, number, of, calls, involved, in, various, stages, of, the, hunt, hardouin, de, fontaines, guerin, s, treatise, le, livre, du, tr, sor, de, v, nerie, 1394, includes, fourteen, hunting, horn, signals, using, a, notation, specially, designed, to, the, purpose, consisting, of, a, series, of, black, and, white, squares, although, dame, juliana, berners, s, boke, of, saint, albans, c, 1345, also, known, as, the, book, of, hawkinge, hunting, and, fysshing, is, cited, as, an, even, earlier, source, of, notated, horn, calls, the, copy, containing, them, actually, dates, from, the, sixteenth, century, as, in, hardouin, s, treatise, the, notation, of, the, calls, is, in, a, specially, designed, tablature, the, first, occurrence, of, horn, calls, in, standard, musical, notation, is, in, the, hunting, treatise, la, v, nerie, by, jacques, du, fouilloux, dated, variously, as, 1561, and, 1573, followed, soon, after, in, an, english, translation, by, george, gascoigne, often, misattributed, to, george, turberville, titled, the, noble, art, of, venerie, or, hvnting, 1575, jacques, du, fouilloux, notates, the, calls, on, a, single, pitch, c, 4, whereas, gascoigne, presents, them, on, d, 4, although, it, is, generally, accepted, that, the, horns, used, on, the, hunt, at, this, early, date, were, only, capable, of, a, single, note, or, at, best, a, striking, of, the, pitch, well, below, and, whooping, up, to, the, true, pitch, the, objection, has, been, raised, against, a, literal, monotonic, interpretation, of, the, notation, on, grounds, that, many, of, the, calls, would, be, indistinguishable, one, from, another, whereas, the, hunt, participants, would, need, each, call, to, be, distinctive, even, if, we, have, no, direct, evidence, of, melodic, variation, apart, from, hunting, calls, there, is, no, surviving, music, from, before, the, seventeenth, century, that, specifies, use, of, the, horn, however, there, are, some, allusions, to, horn, calls, in, vocal, and, keyboard, music, in, the, late, fourteenth, century, italian, caccie, a, word, meaning, both, canon, and, hunt, and, cognate, with, english, chase, sometimes, use, lively, figures, on, two, notes, a, fourth, apart, such, as, gherardello, da, firenze, s, tosto, che, l, alba, after, the, words, suo, corno, sonava, sounded, his, horn, a, less, certain, association, is, found, in, the, same, alternation, of, two, notes, a, fourth, apart, in, john, bull, s, the, king, s, hunt, in, the, fitzwilliam, virginal, book, copied, at, the, beginning, of, the, seventeenth, century, the, increased, tube, length, of, the, cor, plusieurs, tours, in, the, late, sixteenth, century, and, with, the, trompe, de, chasse, in, the, middle, of, the, seventeenth, a, larger, number, of, pitches, became, available, for, horn, calls, and, these, calls, are, imitated, in, programme, music, from, the, second, quarter, of, the, seventeenth, century, onward, though, scored, not, for, actual, horns, but, for, strings, only, an, early, example, is, found, in, the, chiamata, a, la, caccia, in, francesco, cavalli, s, opera, le, nozze, di, teti, e, di, peleo, 1639, a, few, years, later, jean, baptiste, lully, used, horn, calls, in, a, five, part, piece, for, strings, called, le, cors, de, chasse, in, the, com, die, ballet, la, princesse, d, lide, itself, part, of, the, extravagant, entertainment, titled, les, plaisirs, de, l, le, enchant, e, 1664, according, to, another, opinion, lully, actually, meant, the, scoring, of, the, air, des, valets, des, chiens, et, des, chasseurs, avec, cors, de, chasse, to, include, trompes, de, chasse, making, this, the, first, use, of, the, new, instrument, in, a, musical, composition, as, opposed, to, hunting, signals, an, engraving, by, isra, l, silvestre, published, c, 1676, portrays, a, scene, from, lully, s, work, and, is, probably, the, earliest, iconographic, representation, of, the, hooped, horn, soon, afterward, the, hooped, trompe, de, chasse, began, appearing, in, ballet, and, opera, orchestras, in, the, empire, and, german, states, the, intrada, of, a, ballet, by, johann, heinrich, schmelzer, performed, in, linz, on, 15, november, 1680, was, played, by, violins, and, hunting, horns, together, according, to, the, libretto, the, music, does, not, survive, georg, bronner, s, opera, echo, und, narcissus, 1693, and, agostino, steffani, s, opera, i, trionfi, del, fato, produced, in, 1695, in, hanover, also, used, horns, at, about, this, same, time, the, horn, began, to, appear, as, a, solo, instrument, an, anonymous, sonata, da, caccia, con, un, cornu, from, before, 1680, found, in, a, manuscript, in, krom, sets, a, cor, plusieurs, tours, against, two, violins, two, violas, and, basso, continuo, and, a, sonata, venatoria, from, 1684, by, pavel, josef, vejvanovsk, calls, for, two, trombae, breves, which, probably, also, means, spiral, horns, though, hooped, horns, are, not, out, of, the, question, a, particularly, significant, composition, is, a, concerto, 4, in, b, by, johann, beer, for, corne, de, chasse, posthorn, two, violins, and, basso, continuo, beer, died, in, a, hunting, accident, in, 1700, his, concerto, not, only, combines, two, different, kinds, of, horn, but, the, corne, de, chasse, part, is, the, earliest, solo, example, of, a, horn, in, f, sounding, a, fifth, lower, than, written, which, came, to, be, the, classical, size, of, the, instrument, the, f, horn, appears, again, soon, afterward, in, an, aria, from, carlo, agostino, badia, s, opera, diana, rappacificata, vienna, 1700, where, two, horns, play, typical, triple, time, fanfares, by, 1705, the, horn, was, also, being, used, in, church, music, for, example, by, dieterich, buxtehude, in, l, beck, who, in, that, year, called, for, horns, in, his, cantata, templum, honoris, the, horn, did, not, officially, enter, the, imperial, court, orchestra, in, vienna, until, 1712, but, from, there, it, quickly, migrated, to, the, neapolitan, viceroyalty, dominated, at, that, time, by, the, austrians, in, the, works, of, alessandro, scarlatti, and, antonio, lotti, the, horn, was, quickly, adopted, into, neapolitan, opera, the, most, fashionable, in, europe, at, the, time, it, was, in, the, hands, of, these, italian, composers, that, the, horn, took, on, its, characteristic, harmonic, orchestral, role, one, of, the, first, neapolitan, works, to, use, horns, was, scarlatti, s, serenata, il, genio, austriaco, il, sole, flora, zefiro, partenope, e, sebeto, performed, 28, august, 1713, as, part, of, the, celebrations, for, the, birthday, of, empress, elizabeth, christina, on, 19, november, of, the, same, year, lotti, s, opera, porsenna, was, performed, at, the, teatro, s, bartolomeo, in, a, version, adapted, and, directed, by, scarlatti, and, in, almost, all, of, his, own, subsequent, operas, scarlatti, used, horns, in, the, orchestra, the, usual, name, for, the, horn, in, these, neapolitan, scores, was, tromba, da, caccia, an, italianization, of, the, french, trompe, de, chasse, it, is, thought, that, the, trombon, da, caccia, called, for, by, vivaldi, in, his, opera, orlando, finto, pazzo, 1714, and, his, concerto, in, f, for, violin, two, trombon, da, caccia, two, oboes, and, bassoon, rv574, was, also, a, hooped, horn, in, the, eighteenth, century, some, outstanding, concertos, were, written, for, solo, horn, and, orchestra, by, telemann, christoph, f, rster, michael, and, joseph, haydn, leopold, and, wolfgang, amadeus, mozart, and, carl, stamitz, concerti, grossi, include, concertos, for, two, horns, by, vivaldi, and, bach, s, first, brandenburg, concerto, at, the, end, of, the, century, beethoven, composed, a, sonata, for, horn, and, piano, in, f, major, op, 17, for, the, bohemian, virtuoso, giovanni, punto, jan, v, clav, stich, a, master, of, hand, horn, technique, in, the, early, nineteenth, century, carl, maria, von, weber, in, addition, to, giving, the, horn, a, prominent, orchestral, place, in, the, overtures, to, the, operas, oberon, and, der, freisch, tz, composed, a, spectacularly, difficult, concertino, in, e, minor, which, amongst, other, things, includes, an, early, use, of, multiphonics, produced, by, humming, into, the, instrument, while, playing, gioachino, rossini, exploited, the, instrument, s, association, with, hunting, in, a, piece, called, rendez, vous, de, chasse, for, four, corni, da, caccia, and, orchestra, 1828, all, of, these, works, were, written, for, the, natural, horn, the, advent, of, the, valved, horn, brought, new, possibilities, which, were, exploited, by, robert, schumann, in, two, works, written, in, 1849, the, adagio, and, allegro, for, horn, and, piano, op, 70, and, the, concertst, ck, for, four, horns, and, orchestra, other, important, works, from, this, era, are, the, concertos, by, saverio, mercadante, franz, strauss, and, the, first, concerto, 1882, 83, by, his, son, richard, strauss, camille, saint, sa, ns, did, not, write, a, concerto, as, such, but, did, compose, two, romances, for, horn, or, cello, and, orchestra, op, 67, in, e, major, 1866, and, op, 36, in, f, major, 1874, and, a, morceau, de, concert, op, 94, 1887, for, horn, and, orchestra, the, horn, is, a, standard, member, of, the, wind, quintet, and, brass, quintet, and, often, appears, in, other, configurations, notable, works, from, the, late, eighteenth, and, early, nineteenth, centuries, include, two, quintets, by, mozart, one, in, e, major, for, horn, violin, two, violas, and, cello, kv407, 386c, and, the, other, for, piano, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, and, horn, kv452, beethoven, also, wrote, a, quintet, for, piano, and, winds, op, 16, as, well, as, a, sextet, for, two, horns, and, strings, op, 81b, and, a, septet, in, e, major, op, 20, for, clarinet, horn, bassoon, violin, viola, cello, and, double, bass, one, of, schubert, s, last, works, is, the, octet, d803, written, in, 1824, which, adds, a, second, violin, to, beethoven, s, septet, scoring, the, combination, of, horn, with, violin, and, piano, is, called, a, horn, trio, and, though, brahms, s, horn, trio, was, not, the, first, example, it, nevertheless, was, the, first, important, work, in, the, genre, and, inspired, many, later, composers, to, write, for, the, same, grouping, notably, lennox, berkeley, ca, 1953, don, banks, 1962, and, gy, rgy, ligeti, 1982
