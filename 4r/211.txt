and, the, fury, was, faulkner, s, fourth, novel, and, was, not, immediately, successful, in, 1931, however, when, faulkner, s, sixth, novel, sanctuary, was, published, a, sensationalist, story, which, faulkner, later, said, was, written, only, for, money, the, sound, and, the, fury, also, became, commercially, successful, and, faulkner, began, to, receive, critical, attention, the, sound, and, the, fury, is, set, in, jefferson, mississippi, in, the, first, third, of, the, 20th, century, the, novel, centers, on, the, compson, family, former, southern, aristocrats, who, are, struggling, to, deal, with, the, dissolution, of, their, family, and, its, reputation, over, the, course, of, the, 30, years, or, so, relayed, in, the, novel, the, family, falls, into, financial, ruin, loses, its, religious, faith, and, the, respect, of, the, town, of, jefferson, and, many, of, them, die, tragically, the, novel, is, separated, into, four, narratives, the, first, reflecting, events, occurring, and, consequent, thoughts, and, memories, on, april, 7, 1928, is, written, in, the, voice, and, from, the, perspective, of, benjamin, benjy, compson, an, intellectually, disabled, 33, year, old, man, benjy, s, section, is, characterized, by, a, disjointed, narrative, style, with, frequent, chronological, leaps, the, second, section, taking, place, on, june, 2, 1910, focuses, on, quentin, compson, benjy, s, older, brother, and, the, events, leading, up, to, quentin, s, suicide, this, section, is, written, in, the, stream, of, consciousness, style, and, also, contains, frequent, chronological, leaps, in, the, third, section, set, a, day, before, the, first, on, april, 6, 1928, faulkner, writes, from, the, point, of, view, of, jason, quentin, s, cynical, younger, brother, in, the, fourth, section, set, a, day, after, the, first, on, april, 8, 1928, faulkner, introduces, a, third, person, omniscient, point, of, view, this, last, section, primarily, focuses, on, dilsey, one, of, the, compsons, black, servants, and, her, relations, with, jason, and, miss, quentin, compson, daughter, of, quentin, s, sister, caddy, as, dilsey, contemplates, the, thoughts, and, deeds, of, everyone, in, the, compson, family, in, 1945, faulkner, wrote, a, compson, appendix, to, be, included, with, future, printings, of, the, sound, and, the, fury, it, contains, a, 30, page, history, of, the, compson, family, from, 1699, to, 1945, the, first, section, of, the, novel, is, narrated, by, benjamin, benjy, compson, a, source, of, shame, to, the, family, primarily, his, mother, due, to, his, diminished, mental, capacity, the, only, characters, who, show, genuine, care, for, him, are, his, older, sister, caddy, and, dilsey, one, of, the, family, s, black, servants, his, narrative, voice, is, characterized, predominantly, by, its, nonlinearity, spanning, the, period, 1898, 1928, benjy, s, narrative, is, a, series, of, non, chronological, events, presented, in, a, stream, of, consciousness, the, presence, of, italics, in, benjy, s, section, indicates, significant, shifts, in, the, narrative, originally, faulkner, conceived, the, use, of, different, colors, of, ink, to, signify, chronological, breaks, this, nonlinearity, makes, the, style, of, this, section, particularly, challenging, but, benjy, s, style, develops, a, cadence, that, while, not, chronologically, coherent, provides, unbiased, insight, into, many, characters, true, motivations, moreover, benjy, s, caretaker, changes, to, indicate, the, time, period, luster, in, the, present, t, p, in, benjy, s, teenage, years, and, versh, during, benjy, s, infancy, and, childhood, in, this, section, we, see, benjy, s, three, passions, fire, his, sister, caddy, and, the, golf, course, on, land, that, used, to, belong, to, the, compson, family, but, by, 1928, caddy, has, been, banished, from, the, compson, home, after, her, husband, divorced, her, because, her, child, was, not, his, and, the, family, has, had, to, sell, pastureland, to, a, local, golf, club, to, finance, quentin, s, harvard, university, education, in, the, opening, scene, benjy, accompanied, by, luster, a, servant, boy, watches, golfers, on, the, nearby, golf, course, as, he, waits, to, hear, them, call, caddie, the, name, of, his, favorite, sibling, when, one, of, them, calls, for, his, golf, caddie, benjy, s, mind, embarks, on, a, whirlwind, course, of, memories, of, his, sister, caddy, focusing, on, one, critical, scene, in, 1898, when, their, grandmother, died, the, four, compson, children, were, forced, to, play, outside, during, the, funeral, to, see, what, was, going, on, inside, caddy, climbed, a, tree, in, the, yard, and, while, she, looked, inside, her, brothers, quentin, jason, and, benjy, looked, up, and, noticed, that, her, underwear, was, muddy, this, is, benjy, s, first, memory, and, he, associates, caddy, with, trees, throughout, the, rest, of, his, arc, often, saying, that, she, smells, like, trees, other, crucial, memories, in, this, section, are, benjy, s, change, of, name, originally, maury, after, his, wastrel, maternal, uncle, in, 1900, upon, the, discovery, of, his, disability, the, marriage, and, divorce, of, caddy, 1910, and, benjy, s, castration, resulting, from, an, attack, on, a, girl, that, is, alluded, to, briefly, within, this, chapter, when, a, gate, is, left, unlatched, and, benjy, is, out, unsupervised, quentin, the, most, intelligent, of, the, compson, children, gives, the, novel, s, best, example, of, faulkner, s, narrative, technique, we, see, him, as, a, freshman, at, harvard, university, wandering, the, streets, of, cambridge, massachusetts, contemplating, death, and, remembering, his, family, s, estrangement, from, his, sister, caddy, like, the, first, section, its, narrative, is, not, strictly, linear, though, the, two, interweaving, threads, of, quentin, at, harvard, on, the, one, hand, and, of, his, memories, on, the, other, are, clearly, discernible, throughout, this, section, quentin, makes, preparations, for, his, suicide, by, drowning, including, leaving, letters, for, classmates, quentin, s, main, obsession, is, caddy, s, virginity, and, purity, he, is, obsessed, with, southern, ideals, of, chivalry, and, is, strongly, protective, of, women, especially, his, sister, he, is, horrified, when, she, engages, in, sexual, promiscuity, he, turns, to, his, father, for, help, and, counsel, but, the, pragmatic, mr, compson, tells, him, that, virginity, is, invented, by, men, and, should, not, be, taken, seriously, he, also, tells, quentin, that, time, will, heal, all, quentin, spends, much, of, his, time, trying, to, prove, his, father, wrong, but, is, unable, to, do, so, shortly, before, quentin, leaves, for, harvard, in, the, fall, of, 1909, caddy, becomes, pregnant, by, a, lover, she, is, unable, to, identify, perhaps, dalton, ames, whom, quentin, confronts, the, two, fight, with, quentin, losing, disgracefully, and, caddy, vowing, for, quentin, s, sake, to, never, speak, to, dalton, again, quentin, tells, his, father, that, they, have, committed, incest, but, his, father, knows, that, he, is, lying, and, he, did, you, try, to, make, her, do, it, and, i, i, was, afraid, to, i, was, afraid, she, might, and, then, it, wouldn, t, do, any, good, 112, quentin, s, idea, of, incest, is, shaped, by, the, idea, that, if, they, could, just, have, done, something, so, dreadful, that, they, would, have, fled, hell, except, us, 51, he, could, protect, his, sister, by, joining, her, in, whatever, punishment, she, might, endure, in, his, mind, he, feels, a, need, to, take, responsibility, for, caddy, s, sin, pregnant, and, alone, caddy, marries, herbert, head, quentin, finds, him, repulsive, but, caddy, is, resolute, she, must, marry, before, she, gives, birth, herbert, finds, out, that, the, child, is, not, his, and, sends, caddy, and, her, new, daughter, away, in, shame, he, also, rescinds, his, offer, of, a, bank, job, to, caddy, s, brother, jason, who, holds, caddy, responsible, for, this, misfortune, and, never, forgives, her, quentin, s, wanderings, through, harvard, as, he, cuts, classes, follow, the, pattern, of, his, heartbreak, over, losing, caddy, for, instance, he, meets, a, small, italian, immigrant, girl, who, speaks, no, english, significantly, he, calls, her, sister, and, spends, much, of, the, day, trying, to, communicate, with, her, and, to, care, for, her, by, finding, her, home, to, no, avail, he, thinks, sadly, of, the, downfall, and, squalor, of, the, south, after, the, american, civil, war, tormented, by, his, conflicting, thoughts, and, emotions, quentin, commits, suicide, by, drowning, the, third, section, is, narrated, by, jason, the, third, child, and, his, mother, caroline, s, favorite, ironically, he, is, the, only, child, who, does, not, want, need, or, return, her, love, it, takes, place, the, day, before, benjy, s, section, on, good, friday, of, the, three, brothers, sections, jason, s, is, the, most, straightforward, reflecting, his, single, minded, desire, to, make, money, he, worries, obsessively, about, his, bad, investments, in, the, cotton, market, which, symbolize, the, financial, decline, of, the, south, by, 1928, jason, s, father, has, died, and, jason, has, become, the, family, breadwinner, he, supports, his, mother, benjy, and, miss, quentin, daughter, of, caddy, the, family, s, second, born, as, well, as, the, family, s, servants, the, unjust, burden, makes, him, bitter, and, cynical, with, little, of, the, passionate, sensitivity, of, his, irresponsible, older, brother, and, sister, he, goes, so, far, as, to, blackmail, caddy, into, making, him, miss, quentin, s, sole, guardian, then, uses, that, role, to, steal, the, support, payments, that, caddy, sends, for, her, daughter, amounting, to, tens, of, thousands, of, dollars, over, 17, years, stashing, thousands, in, cash, in, a, strongbox, jason, uses, the, money, to, maintain, a, mistress, in, memphis, and, play, the, stock, market, miss, quentin, and, her, lover, later, recoup, some, of, the, money, by, climbing, through, a, window, and, purloining, the, strongbox, this, is, the, first, section, narrated, in, a, mostly, linear, fashion, compared, with, benjy, and, quentin, s, disjointed, stream, of, consciousness, it, follows, the, course, of, good, friday, a, day, on, which, jason, decides, to, leave, work, to, search, for, miss, quentin, who, has, run, away, seemingly, in, pursuit, of, mischief, here, we, see, most, immediately, the, conflict, between, the, two, predominant, traits, of, the, compson, family, which, caroline, attributes, to, the, difference, between, her, blood, and, her, husband, s, on, the, one, hand, miss, quentin, s, recklessness, and, passion, inherited, from, her, mother, and, compson, grandfather, on, the, other, jason, s, ruthless, cynicism, drawn, from, his, mother, s, side, this, section, also, gives, the, clearest, image, of, domestic, life, in, the, compson, household, with, jason, and, the, servants, caring, for, hypochondriac, caroline, and, disabled, benjy, april, 8, 1928, is, easter, sunday, this, section, the, only, one, without, a, single, first, person, narrator, focuses, on, dilsey, the, powerful, matriarch, of, the, black, family, servants, she, in, contrast, to, the, declining, compsons, draws, strength, from, her, faith, standing, proud, amid, a, dying, family, on, this, easter, sunday, dilsey, takes, her, family, and, benjy, to, the, colored, church, through, her, we, sense, the, decay, and, depravity, which, have, ripened, in, the, compsons, for, decades, dilsey, is, mistreated, and, abused, but, remains, loyal, she, and, her, grandson, luster, tend, to, benjy, as, she, takes, him, to, church, and, tries, to, bring, him, to, salvation, the, preacher, s, sermon, makes, her, weep, for, the, compson, family, whose, destruction, she, is, now, witnessing, meanwhile, the, tension, between, jason, and, miss, quentin, reaches, its, inevitable, conclusion, the, family, discovers, that, miss, quentin, has, run, away, in, the, night, with, a, carnival, worker, having, taken, the, strongbox, in, which, jason, had, hidden, all, his, savings, both, earned, and, stolen, jason, complains, to, the, sheriff, who, is, sympathetic, to, miss, quentin, and, refuses, to, help, since, much, of, the, money, had, been, embezzled, from, miss, quentin, jason, doesn, t, press, the, issue, he, sets, off, to, find, her, on, his, own, but, loses, her, trail, in, nearby, mottson, and, gives, up, after, church, dilsey, allows, her, grandson, luster, to, drive, benjy, in, the, family, s, decrepit, horse, and, carriage, to, the, graveyard, luster,

turns, around, to, look, at, benjy, and, sees, him, holding, his, drooping, flower, his, eyes, empty, and, blue, and, serene, again, in, 1945, faulkner, wrote, an, appendix, to, the, novel, to, be, published, in, the, then, forthcoming, anthology, the, portable, faulkner, edited, by, malcolm, cowley, at, faulkner, s, behest, subsequent, printings, of, the, sound, and, the, fury, frequently, contain, the, appendix, at, the, end, of, the, book, it, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, fifth, part, written, sixteen, years, after, the, sound, and, the, fury, the, appendix, shows, textual, differences, from, the, novel, but, serves, to, clarify, the, novel, s, opaque, story, the, appendix, is, presented, as, a, complete, history, of, the, compson, family, lineage, beginning, with, the, arrival, of, their, ancestor, quentin, maclachlan, in, america, in, 1779, and, continuing, through, 1945, including, events, that, transpired, after, the, novel, which, takes, place, in, 1928, in, particular, the, appendix, reveals, that, caroline, bascomb, compson, died, in, 1933, at, which, time, jason, had, benjy, committed, to, the, state, asylum, in, jackson, fired, the, black, servants, sold, the, last, of, the, compson, land, and, moved, into, an, apartment, above, his, farming, supply, store, it, is, also, revealed, that, jason, had, himself, declared, benjy, s, legal, guardian, many, years, ago, without, their, mother, s, knowledge, and, used, this, status, to, have, benjy, castrated, the, appendix, also, reveals, the, fate, of, caddy, last, seen, in, the, novel, when, her, daughter, quentin, is, still, a, baby, after, marrying, and, divorcing, a, second, time, to, a, minor, moving, picture, magnate, in, hollywood, caddy, moved, to, paris, where, she, lived, at, the, time, of, the, german, occupation, in, 1943, the, librarian, of, yoknapatawpha, county, discovered, a, magazine, photograph, of, caddy, in, the, company, of, a, german, staff, general, and, attempted, separately, to, recruit, jason, and, dilsey, to, save, her, jason, at, first, acknowledging, that, the, photo, was, of, his, sister, denied, it, after, realizing, that, the, librarian, wanted, his, help, while, dilsey, pretended, to, be, unable, to, see, the, picture, at, all, the, librarian, later, realized, that, while, jason, remains, cold, and, unsympathetic, towards, caddy, dilsey, simply, understands, that, caddy, neither, wants, nor, needs, to, be, saved, from, the, germans, because, nothing, else, remains, for, her, the, appendix, concludes, with, an, accounting, for, the, black, family, who, worked, as, servants, to, the, compsons, unlike, the, entries, for, the, compsons, themselves, which, are, lengthy, detailed, and, told, with, an, omniscient, narrative, perspective, the, servants, entries, are, simple, and, succinct, dilsey, s, entry, the, final, in, the, appendix, consists, of, two, words, they, endured, the, novel, s, episodes, follow, the, three, days, of, easter, the, four, parts, of, the, novel, relate, many, of, the, same, episodes, each, from, a, different, point, of, view, and, therefore, with, emphasis, on, different, themes, and, events, this, interweaving, and, nonlinear, structure, makes, any, true, synopsis, of, the, novel, difficult, especially, since, the, narrators, are, all, unreliable, in, their, own, way, making, their, accounts, not, necessarily, trustworthy, at, all, times, also, in, this, novel, faulkner, uses, italics, to, indicate, points, in, each, section, where, the, narrative, is, moving, into, a, significant, moment, in, the, past, the, use, of, these, italics, can, be, confusing, however, as, time, shifts, are, not, always, marked, by, the, use, of, italics, and, periods, of, different, time, in, each, section, do, not, necessarily, stay, in, italics, for, the, duration, of, the, flashback, thus, these, time, shifts, can, often, be, jarring, and, confusing, and, require, particularly, close, reading, when, faulkner, began, writing, the, story, that, would, develop, into, the, sound, and, the, fury, it, was, tentatively, titled, twilight, narrated, by, a, fourth, compson, child, but, as, the, story, progressed, into, a, larger, work, he, renamed, it, drawing, its, title, from, macbeth, s, famous, soliloquy, from, act, 5, scene, 5, of, william, shakespeare, s, macbeth, tomorrow, and, tomorrow, and, tomorrow, creeps, in, this, petty, pace, from, day, to, day, to, the, last, syllable, of, recorded, time, and, all, our, yesterdays, have, lighted, fools, the, way, to, dusty, death, out, out, brief, candle, life, s, but, a, walking, shadow, a, poor, player, that, struts, and, frets, his, hour, upon, the, stage, and, then, is, heard, no, more, it, is, a, tale, told, by, an, idiot, full, of, sound, and, fury, signifying, nothing, immediately, obvious, is, the, notion, of, a, tale, told, by, an, idiot, in, this, case, benjy, whose, view, of, the, compsons, story, opens, the, novel, the, idea, can, be, extended, also, to, quentin, and, jason, whose, narratives, display, their, own, varieties, of, idiocy, more, to, the, point, the, novel, recounts, the, way, to, dusty, death, of, a, traditional, upper, class, southern, family, the, last, line, is, perhaps, the, most, meaningful, faulkner, said, in, his, nobel, prize, in, literature, acceptance, speech, that, people, must, write, about, things, that, come, from, the, heart, universal, truths, otherwise, they, signify, nothing, upon, publication, the, influential, critic, clifton, fadiman, dismissed, the, novel, arguing, in, the, nation, that, the, theme, and, the, characters, are, trivial, unworthy, of, the, enormous, and, complex, craftsmanship, expended, on, them, but, the, sound, and, the, fury, ultimately, went, on, to, achieve, a, prominent, place, among, the, greatest, of, american, novels, playing, a, role, in, william, faulkner, s, receiving, the, 1949, nobel, prize, in, literature, it, is, nearly, unanimously, considered, a, masterpiece, by, literary, critics, and, scholars, but, its, unconventional, narrative, style, frequently, alienates, new, readers, although, the, vocabulary, is, generally, basic, the, stream, of, consciousness, technique, which, attempts, to, transcribe, the, thoughts, of, the, narrators, directly, with, frequent, switches, in, time, and, setting, and, with, loose, sentence, structure, and, grammar, has, made, it, a, quintessentially, difficult, modernist, work, the, sound, and, the, fury, is, a, widely, influential, work, of, literature, faulkner, has, been, praised, for, his, ability, to, recreate, the, thought, process, of, the, human, mind, in, addition, it, is, viewed, as, an, essential, development, in, the, stream, of, consciousness, literary, technique, in, 2012, the, folio, society, released, an, edition, limited, to, 1480, copies, of, the, sound, and, the, fury, this, edition, is, the, first, to, use, colored, ink, to, represent, different, time, sequences, for, the, first, section, of, the, novel, this, limited, edition, is, also, sold, with, a, special, commentary, volume, edited, by, faulkner, scholars, stephen, ross, and, noel, polk, according, to, the, folio, society, we, can, never, know, if, this, is, exactly, what, faulkner, would, have, envisaged, but, the, result, justifies, his, belief, that, coloured, inks, would, allow, readers, to, follow, the, strands, of, the, novel, more, easily, without, compromising, the, thought, transference, for, which, he, argued, so, passionately
