and, expanding, leaves, of, grass, until, his, death, in, 1892, six, or, nine, individual, editions, of, leaves, of, grass, were, produced, depending, on, how, they, are, distinguished, this, resulted, in, vastly, different, editions, over, four, decades, the, first, edition, was, a, small, book, of, twelve, poems, and, the, last, was, a, compilation, of, over, 400, the, collection, of, loosely, connected, poems, represents, the, celebration, of, his, philosophy, of, life, and, humanity, and, praises, nature, and, the, individual, human, s, role, in, it, rather, than, focusing, on,

length, leaves, of, grass, is, regarded, by, many, scholars, as, a, completely, do, it, yourself, project, whitman, chose, his, idealized, self, as, the, subject, of, the, book, created, the, style, in, which, it, was, written, and, worked, hard, and, intelligently, to, perfect, the, style, over, a, period, of, six, or, seven, years, creating, the, personality, of, the, proletarian, bard, the, supposed, writer, of, the, poems, leaves, of, grass, is, also, notable, for, its, discussion, of, delight, in, sensual, pleasures, during, a, time, when, such, candid, displays, were, considered, immoral, the, book, was, highly, controversial, during, its, time, for, its, explicit, sexual, imagery, and, whitman, was, subject, to, derision, by, many, contemporary, critics, over, time, however, the, collection, has, infiltrated, popular, culture, and, became, recognized, as, one, of, the, central, works, of, american, poetry, among, the, works, in, this, collection, are, song, of, myself, i, sing, the, body, electric, and, out, of, the, cradle, endlessly, rocking, later, editions, would, include, whitman, s, elegy, to, the, assassinated, president, abraham, lincoln, when, lilacs, last, in, the, dooryard, bloom, d, the, first, edition, of, leaves, of, grass, was, published, on, july, 4, 1855, the, poem, has, its, beginnings, in, an, essay, by, ralph, waldo, emerson, called, the, poet, 1844, which, expressed, the, need, for, the, united, states, to, have, its, own, new, and, unique, poet, to, write, about, the, new, country, s, virtues, and, vices, this, concept, along, with, the, call, to, abandon, strict, rhyme, and, meter, were, explored, more, fully, in, earlier, works, by, john, neal, novels, randolph, 1823, and, rachel, dyer, 1828, whitman, likely, having, read, all, three, consciously, set, out, to, answer, their, call, he, thus, began, working, on, the, first, edition, of, leaves, of, grass, whitman, later, commented, on, emerson, s, influence, stating, i, was, simmering, simmering, simmering, emerson, brought, me, to, a, boil, on, may, 15, 1855, whitman, registered, the, title, leaves, of, grass, with, the, clerk, of, the, united, states, district, court, southern, district, of, new, jersey, and, received, its, copyright, the, title, is, a, pun, as, grass, was, a, term, given, by, publishers, to, works, of, minor, value, and, leaves, is, another, name, for, the, pages, on, which, they, were, printed, the, first, edition, was, published, in, brooklyn, at, the, printing, shop, of, two, scottish, immigrants, james, and, andrew, rome, whom, whitman, had, known, since, the, 1840s, the, shop, was, located, at, fulton, street, now, cadman, plaza, west, and, cranberry, street, now, the, site, of, apartment, buildings, that, bear, whitman, s, name, whitman, paid, for, and, did, much, of, the, typesetting, for, the, first, edition, himself, a, calculated, feature, of, the, first, edition, was, that, the, book, included, neither, the, author, nor, the, publisher, s, name, both, the, author, and, publisher, being, whitman, instead, the, cover, included, an, engraving, by, samuel, hollyer, depicting, whitman, himself, in, work, clothes, and, a, jaunty, hat, arms, at, his, side, this, figure, was, meant, to, represent, the, devil, may, care, american, working, man, of, the, time, one, who, might, be, taken, as, an, almost, idealized, figure, in, any, crowd, the, engraver, later, commenting, on, his, depiction, described, the, character, with, a, rakish, kind, of, slant, like, the, mast, of, a, schooner, the, first, edition, contained, no, table, of, contents, and, none, of, the, poems, had, a, title, early, advertisements, appealed, to, lovers, of, literary, curiosities, as, an, oddity, sales, of, the, book, were, few, but, whitman, was, not, discouraged, one, paper, bound, copy, was, sent, to, emerson, who, had, initially, inspired, its, creation, emerson, responded, with, a, letter, of, heartfelt, thanks, writing, i, find, it, the, most, extraordinary, piece, of, wit, and, wisdom, america, has, yet, contributed, he, went, on, i, am, very, happy, in, reading, it, as, great, power, makes, us, happy, the, letter, was, printed, in, the, new, york, tribune, without, the, writer, s, permission, and, caused, an, uproar, among, prominent, new, england, men, of, letters, including, henry, david, thoreau, and, amos, bronson, alcott, who, were, some, of, the, few, transcendentalists, who, agreed, with, emerson, s, letter, and, his, statements, regarding, leaves, of, grass, dear, sir, i, am, not, blind, to, the, worth, of, the, wonderful, gift, of, leaves, of, grass, i, find, it, the, most, extraordinary, piece, of, wit, wisdom, that, america, has, yet, contributed, i, am, very, happy, in, reading, it, as, great, power, makes, us, happy, it, meets, the, demand, i, am, always, making, of, what, seemed, the, sterile, stingy, nature, as, if, too, much, handiwork, or, too, much, lymph, in, the, temperament, were, making, our, western, wits, fat, mean, i, give, you, joy, of, your, free, brave, thought, i, have, great, joy, in, it, i, find, incomparable, things, said, incomparably, well, as, they, must, be, i, find, the, courage, of, treatment, which, so, delights, us, which, large, perception, only, can, inspire, i, greet, you, at, the, beginning, of, a, great, career, which, yet, must, have, had, a, long, foreground, somewhere, for, such, a, start, i, rubbed, my, eyes, a, little, to, see, if, this, sunbeam, were, no, illusion, but, the, solid, sense, of, the, book, is, a, sober, certainty, it, had, the, best, merits, namely, of, fortifying, encouraging, i, did, not, know, until, i, last, night, saw, the, book, advertised, in, a, newspaper, that, i, could, trust, the, name, as, real, available, for, a, post, office, i, wish, to, see, my, benefactor, have, felt, much, like, striking, my, tasks, visiting, new, york, to, pay, you, my, respects, r, w, emerson, letter, to, walter, whitman, july, 21, 1855, the, first, edition, was, very, small, and, collected, only, twelve, unnamed, poems, in, 95, pages, whitman, once, said, he, intended, the, book, to, be, small, enough, to, be, carried, in, a, pocket, that, would, tend, to, induce, people, to, take, me, along, with, them, and, read, me, in, the, open, air, i, am, nearly, always, successful, with, the, reader, in, the, open, air, he, explained, about, 800, copies, were, printed, though, only, 200, were, bound, in, its, trademark, green, cloth, cover, the, only, american, library, known, to, have, purchased, a, copy, of, the,

of, leaves, of, grass, the, count, depending, on, how, they, are, distinguished, scholars, who, hold, that, an, edition, is, an, entirely, new, set, of, type, will, count, the, 1855, 1856, 1860, 1867, 1871, 72, and, 1881, printings, whereas, others, will, include, the, 1876, 1888, 1889, and, 1891, 1892, the, deathbed, edition, releases, the, editions, were, of, varying, length, each, one, larger, and, augmented, from, the, previous, version, the, final, edition, reached, over, 400, poems, the, first, 1855, edition, is, particularly, notable, for, its, inclusion, of, the, poems, song, of, myself, and, the, sleepers, it, was, emerson, s, positive, response, to, the, first, edition, that, inspired, whitman, to, quickly, produce, a, much, expanded, second, edition, in, 1856, this, new, edition, contained, 384, pages, and, had, a, cover, price, of, one, dollar, it, also, included, a, phrase, from, emerson, s, letter, printed, in, gold, leaf, i, greet, you, at, the, beginning, of, a, great, career, recognized, as, a, first, for, u, s, book, publishing, and, marketing, techniques, whitman, has, been, cited, as, inventing, the, use, of, the, book, blurb, laura, dassow, walls, professor, of, english, at, the, university, of, notre, dame, noted, in, one, stroke, whitman, had, given, birth, to, the, modern, cover, blurb, quite, without, emerson, s, permission, emerson, later, took, offense, that, this, letter, was, made, public, and, became, more, critical, of, his, work, this, edition, included, crossing, brooklyn, ferry, a, notable, poem, the, publishers, of, the, 1860, edition, thayer, eldridge, declared, bankruptcy, shortly, after, its, publication, and, were, almost, unable, to, pay, whitman, in, regard, to, money, matters, they, wrote, we, are, very, short, ourselves, and, it, is, quite, impossible, to, send, the, sum, whitman, received, only, 250, and, the, original, plates, made, their, way, to, boston, publisher, horace, wentworth, when, the, 456, page, book, was, finally, issued, whitman, said, it, is, quite, odd, of, course, referring, to, its, appearance, it, was, bound, in, orange, cloth, with, symbols, like, a, rising, sun, with, nine, spokes, of, light, and, a, butterfly, perched, on, a, hand, whitman, claimed, that, the, butterfly, was, real, in, order, to, foster, his, image, as, being, one, with, nature, in, fact, the, butterfly, was, made, of, cloth, and, was, attached, to, his, finger, with, wire, the, major, poems, added, to, this, edition, were, a, word, out, of, the, sea, and, as, i, ebb, d, with, the, ocean, of, life, the, 1867, edition, was, intended, to, be, according, to, whitman, a, new, much, better, edition, of, leaves, of, grass, complete, that, unkillable, work, he, assumed, it, would, be, the, final, edition, the, edition, which, included, the, drum, taps, section, its, sequel, and, the, new, songs, before, parting, was, delayed, when, the, binder, went, bankrupt, and, its, distributing, firm, failed, when, it, was, finally, printed, it, was, a, simple, edition, and, the, first, to, omit, a, picture, of, the, poet, in, 1879, richard, worthington, purchased, the, electrotype, plates, and, began, printing, and, marketing, unauthorized, copies, the, 1889, eighth, edition, was, little, changed, from, the, 1881, version, but, it, was, more, embellished, and, featured, several, portraits, of, whitman, the, biggest, change, was, the, addition, of, an, annex, of, miscellaneous, additional, poems, by, its, later, editions, leaves, of, grass, had, grown, to, 14, sections, earlier, editions, contained, a, section, called, chants, democratic, later, editions, omitted, some, of, the, poems, from, this, section, publishing, others, in, calamus, and, other, sections, as, 1891, came, to, a, close, whitman, prepared, a, final, edition, of, leaves, of, grass, writing, to, a, friend, upon, its, completion, l, of, g, at, last, complete, after, 33, y, rs, of, hackling, at, it, all, times, moods, of, my, life, fair, weather, foul, all, parts, of, the, land, and, peace, war, young, old, this, last, version, of, leaves, of, grass, was, published, in, 1892, and, is, referred, to, as, the, deathbed, edition, in, january, 1892, two, months, before, whitman, s, death, an, announcement, was, published, in, the, new, york, herald, walt, whitman, wishes, respectfully, to, notify, the, public, that, the, book, leaves, of, grass, which, he, has, been, working, on, at, great, intervals, and, partially, issued, for, the, past, thirty, five, or, forty, years, is, now, completed, so, to, call, it, and, he, would, like, this, new, 1892, edition, to, absolutely, supersede, all, previous, ones, faulty, as, it, is, he, decides, it, as, by, far, his, special, and, entire, self, chosen, poetic, utterance, by, the, time, this, last, edition, was, completed, leaves, of, grass, had, grown, from, a, small, book, of, 12, poems, to, a, hefty, tome, of, almost, 400, poems, as, the, volume, changed, so, did, the, pictures, that, whitman, used, to, illustrate, them, the, last, edition, depicts, an, older, whitman, with, a, full, beard, and, jacket, in, 1995, dail, glaswellt, the, welsh, language, translation, was, published, whitman, s, collection, of, poems, in, leaves, of, grass, is, usually, interpreted, according, to, the, individual, poems, contained, within, its, individual, editions, discussion, is, often, focused, upon, the, major, editions, typically, associated, with, the, early, respective, versions, of, 1855, and, 1856, to, the, 1860, edition, and, finally, to, editions, late, into, whitman, s, life, these, latter, editions, would, include, the, poem, when, lilacs, last, in, the, dooryard, bloom, d, whitman, s, elegy, to, abraham, lincoln, after, his, death, while, whitman, has, famously, proclaimed, in, song, of, myself, his, poetry, to, be, nature, without, check, with, original, energy, scholars, have, discovered, that, whitman, borrowed, from, a, number, of, sources, for, his, leaves, of, grass, for, his, drum, taps, for, instance, he, lifted, phrases, from, popular, newspapers, dealing, with, civil, war, battles, he, also, condensed, a, chapter, from, a, popular, science, book, into, his, poem, the, world, below, the, brine, in, a, constantly, changing, culture, whitman, s, literature, has, an, element, of, timelessness, that, appeals, to, the, american, notion, of, democracy, and, equality, producing, the, same, experience, and, feelings, within, people, living, centuries, apart, originally, written, at, a, time, of, significant, urbanization, in, america, leaves, of, grass, also, responds, to, the, impact, such, has, on, the, masses, the, title, metaphor, of, grass, however, indicates, a, pastoral, vision, of, rural, idealism, particularly, in, song, of, myself, whitman, emphasizes, an, all, powerful, i, who, serves, as, narrator, the, i, attempts, to, relieve, both, social, and, private, problems, by, using, powerful, affirmative, cultural, images, the, emphasis, on, american, culture, in, particular, helped, reach, whitman, s, intention, of, creating, a, distinctly, american, epic, poem, comparable, to, the, works, of, homer, as, a, believer, in, phrenology, whitman, in, the, 1855, preface, to, leaves, of, grass, includes, the, phrenologist, among, those, he, describes, as, the, lawgivers, of, poets, borrowing, from, the, discipline, whitman, uses, the, phrenological, concept, of, adhesiveness, in, reference, to, one, s, propensity, for, friendship, and, camaraderie, whitman, edited, revised, and, republished, leaves, of, grass, many, times, before, his, death, and, over, the, years, his, focus, and, ideas, were, not, static, one, critic, has, identified, three, major, thematic, drifts, in, leaves, of, grass, the, period, from, 1855, to, 1859, from, 1859, to, 1865, and, from, 1866, to, his, death, in, the, first, period, 1855, to, 1859, his, major, work, is, song, of, myself, which, exemplifies, his, prevailing, love, for, freedom, freedom, in, nature, nature, which, is, perfect, in, time, and, place, and, freedom, in, expression, leading, to, the, expression, of, love, in, its, sensuous, form, the, second, period, from, 1859, to, 1865, paints, the, picture, of, a, more, melancholic, sober, poet, in, poems, like, out, of, the, cradle, endlessly, rocking, and, when, lilacs, last, in, the, dooryard, bloom, d, the, prevailing, themes, are, of, love, and, of, death, from, 1866, to, his, death, the, ideas, whitman, presented, in, his, second, period, had, experienced, an, evolution, his, focus, on, death, had, grown, to, a, focus, on, immortality, the, major, theme, of, this, period, whitman, became, more, conservative, in, his, old, age, and, had, come, to, believe, that, the, importance, of, law, exceeded, the, importance, of, freedom, his, materialistic, view, of, the, world, became, far, more, spiritual, believing, that, life, had, no, meaning, outside, of, the, context, of, god, s, plan, when, the, book, was, first, published, whitman, was, fired, from, his, job, at, the, department, of, the, interior, after, secretary, of, the, interior, james, harlan, read, it, and, said, he, found, it, offensive, an, early, review, of, the, first, publication, focused, on, the, persona, of, the, anonymous, poet, calling, him, a, loafer, with, a, certain, air, of, mild, defiance, and, an, expression, of, pensive, insolence, on, his, face, another, reviewer, viewed, the, work, as, an, odd, attempt, at, reviving, old, transcendental, thoughts, the, speculations, of, that, school, of, thought, which, culminated, at, boston, fifteen, or, eighteen, years, ago, emerson, approved, of, the, work, in, part, because, he, considered, it, a, means, of, reviving, transcendentalism, though, even, he, urged, whitman, to, tone, down, the, sexual, imagery, in, 1860, poet, john, greenleaf, whittier, was, said, to, have, thrown, his, 1855, edition, into, the, fire, thomas, wentworth, higginson, wrote, it, is, no, discredit, to, walt, whitman, that, he, wrote, leaves, of, grass, only, that, he, did, not, burn, it, afterwards, the, saturday, press, printed, a, thrashing, review, that, advised, its, author, to, commit, suicide, critic, rufus, wilmot, griswold, reviewed, leaves, of, grass, in, the, november, 10, 1855, issue, of, the, criterion, calling, it, a, mass, of, stupid, filth, and, categorized, its, author, as, a, filthy, free, lover, griswold, also, suggested, in, latin, that, whitman, was, guilty, of, that, horrible, sin, not, to, be, mentioned, among, christians, one, of, the, earliest, public, accusations, of, whitman, s, homosexuality, griswold, s, intensely, negative, review, almost, caused, the, publication, of, the, second, edition, to, be, suspended, whitman, incorporated, the, full, review, including, the, innuendo, in, a, later, edition, of, leaves, of, grass, not, all, responses, were, negative, however, critic, william, michael, rossetti, considered, leaves, of, grass, a, classic, along, the, lines, of, the, works, of, william, shakespeare, and, dante, alighieri, a, woman, from, connecticut, named, susan, garnet, smith, wrote, to, whitman, to, profess, her, love, for, him, after, reading, leaves, of, grass, and, even, offered, him, her, womb, should, he, want, a, child, although, he, found, much, of, the, language, reckless, and, indecent, critic, and, editor, george, ripley, believed, isolated, portions, of, leaves, of, grass, radiated, vigor, and, quaint, beauty, whitman, firmly, believed, he, would, be, accepted, and, embraced, by, the, populace, especially, the, working, class, years, later, he, regretted, not, having, toured, the, country, to, deliver, his, poetry, directly, by, lecturing, if, i, had, gone, directly, to, the, people, read, my, poems, faced, the, crowds, got, into, immediate, touch, with, tom, dick, and, harry, instead, of, waiting, to, be, interpreted, i, d, have, had, my, audience, at, once, on, march, 1, 1882, boston, district, attorney, oliver, stevens, wrote, to, whitman, s, publisher, james, r, osgood, that, leaves, of, grass, constituted, obscene, literature, urged, by, the, new, england, society, for, the, suppression, of, vice, his, letter, said, we, are, of, the, opinion, that, this, book, is, such, a, book, as, brings, it, within, the, provisions, of, the, public, statutes, respecting, obscene, literature, and, suggest, the, propriety, of, withdrawing, the, same, from, circulation, and, suppressing, the, editions, thereof, stevens, demanded, the, removal, of, the, poems, a, woman, waits, for, me, and, to, a, common, prostitute, as, well, as, changes, to, song, of, myself, from, pent, up, aching, rivers, i, sing, the, body, electric, spontaneous, me, native, moments, the, dalliance, of, the, eagles, by, blue, ontario, s, shore, unfolded, out, of, the, folds, the, sleepers, and, faces, whitman, rejected, the, censorship, writing, to, osgood, the, list, whole, several, is, rejected, by, me, will, not, be, thought, of, under, any, circumstances, osgood, refused, to, republish, the, book, and, returned, the, plates, to, whitman, when, his, suggested, changes, and, deletions, were, ignored, the, poet, found, a, new, publisher, rees, welsh, company, which, released, a, new, edition, of, the, book, in, 1882, whitman, believed, the, controversy, would, increase, sales, which, proved, true, its, banning, in, boston, for, example, became, a, major, scandal, and, it, generated, much, publicity, for, whitman, and, his, work, though, it, was, also, banned, by, retailers, like, wanamaker, s, in, philadelphia, this, version, went, through, five, editions, of, 1, 000, copies, each, its, first, printing, released, on, july, 18, sold, out, in, a, day, its, status, as, one, of, the, more, important, collections, of, american, poetry, has, meant, that, over, time, various, groups, and, movements, have, used, leaves, of, grass, and, whitman, s, work, in, general, to, advance, their, own, political, and, social, purposes, for, example, nevertheless, whitman, has, been, criticized, for, the, nationalism, expressed, in, leaves, of, grass, and, other, works, in, a, 2009, essay, regarding, whitman, s, nationalism, in, the, first, edition, nathanael, o, reilly, claims, that, whitman, s, imagined, america, is, arrogant, expansionist, hierarchical, racist, and, exclusive, such, an, america, is, unacceptable, to, native, americans, african, americans, immigrants, the, disabled, the, infertile, and, all, those, who, value, equal, rights
