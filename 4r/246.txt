https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_(Plato)
the, republic, greek, translit, politeia, latin, de, republica, is, a, socratic, dialogue, authored, by, plato, around, 375, bc, concerning, justice, the, order, and, character, of, the, just, city, state, and, the, just, man, it, is, plato, s, best, known, work, and, one, of, the, world, s, most, influential, works, of, philosophy, and, political, theory, both, intellectually, and, historically, in, the, dialogue, socrates, discusses, the, meaning, of, justice, and, whether, the, just, man, is, happier, than, the, unjust, man, with, various, athenians, and, foreigners, he, considers, the, natures, of, existing, regimes, and, then, proposes, a, series, of, hypothetical, cities, in, comparison, culminating, in, kallipolis, a, utopian, city, state, ruled, by, a, class, of, philosopher, kings, they, also, discuss, ageing, love, theory, of, forms, the, immortality, of, the, soul, and, the, role, of, the, philosopher, and, of, poetry, in, society, the, dialogue, s, setting, seems, to, be, the, time, of, the, peloponnesian, war, the, republic, is, generally, placed, in, the, middle, period, of, plato, s, dialogues, however, the, distinction, of, this, group, from, the, early, dialogues, is, not, as, clear, as, the, distinction, of, the, late, dialogues, from, all, the, others, nonetheless, ritter, arnim, and, baron, with, their, separate, methodologies, all, agreed, that, the, republic, was, well, distinguished, along, with, parmenides, phaedrus, and, theaetetus, however, the, first, book, of, the, republic, which, shares, many, features, with, earlier, dialogues, is, thought, to, have, originally, been, written, as, a, separate, work, and, then, the, remaining, books, were, conjoined, to, it, perhaps, with, modifications, to, the, original, of, the, first, book, while, visiting, athens, s, port, piraeus, with, glaucon, socrates, is, invited, to, join, polemarchus, for, a, dinner, and, festival, they, eventually, end, up, at, polemarchus, house, where, socrates, encounters, polemarchus, father, cephalus, in, his, first, philosophical, conversation, with, the, group, members, socrates, gets, into, a, conversation, with, cephalus, the, first, real, philosophical, question, posed, by, plato, in, the, book, is, when, socrates, asks, is, life, painful, at, that, age, or, what, report, do, you, make, of, it, when, speaking, to, the, aged, cephalus, cephalus, answers, by, saying, that, many, are, unhappy, about, old, age, because, they, miss, their, youth, but, he, finds, that, old, age, brings, us, profound, repose, and, freedom, from, this, and, other, passions, when, the, appetites, have, abated, and, their, force, is, diminished, the, description, of, sophocles, is, perfectly, realized, it, is, like, being, delivered, from, a, multitude, of, furious, masters, the, repose, gives, him, time, to, dedicate, himself, to, sacrifices, and, justice, so, that, he, is, prepared, for, the, afterlife, socrates, then, asks, his, interlocutors, for, a, definition, of, justice, three, are, suggested, socrates, refutes, each, definition, in, turn, thrasymachus, then, responds, to, this, refutation, by, claiming, that, insofar, as, the, stronger, make, mistakes, they, are, not, in, that, regard, the, stronger, socrates, refutes, thrasymachus, with, a, further, argument, crafts, aim, at, the, good, of, their, object, and, therefore, to, rule, is, for, the, benefit, of, the, ruled, and, not, the, ruler, at, this, point, thrasymachus, claims, that, the, unjust, person, is, wiser, than, the, just, person, and, socrates, gives, three, arguments, refuting, thrasymachus, however, thrasymachus, ceases, to, engage, actively, with, socrates, s, arguments, and, socrates, himself, seems, to, think, that, his, arguments, are, inadequate, since, he, has, not, offered, any, definition, of, justice, the, first, book, ends, in, aporia, concerning, the, essence, of, justice, glaucon, and, adeimantus, are, unsatisfied, with, socrates, s, defense, of, justice, they, ask, socrates, to, defend, justice, against, an, alternative, view, that, they, attribute, to, many, according, to, this, view, the, origin, of, justice, is, in, social, contracts, everyone, would, prefer, to, get, away, with, harm, to, others, without, suffering, it, themselves, but, since, they, cannot, they, agree, not, to, do, harm, to, others, so, as, not, to, suffer, it, themselves, moreover, according, to, this, view, all, those, who, practice, justice, do, so, unwillingly, and, out, of, fear, of, punishment, and, the, life, of, the, unpunished, unjust, man, is, far, more, blessed, than, that, of, the, just, man, glaucon, would, like, socrates, to, prove, that, justice, is, not, only, desirable, for, its, consequences, but, also, for, its, own, sake, to, demonstrate, the, problem, he, tells, the, story, of, gyges, who, with, the, help, of, a, ring, that, turns, him, invisible, achieves, great, advantages, for, himself, by, committing, injustices, many, think, that, anyone, would, and, should, use, the, ring, as, gyges, did, if, they, had, it, glaucon, uses, this, argument, to, challenge, socrates, to, defend, the, position, that, the, just, life, is, better, than, the, unjust, life, adeimantus, supplements, glaucon, s, speech, with, further, arguments, he, suggests, that, the, unjust, should, not, fear, divine, judgement, since, the, very, poets, who, wrote, about, such, judgement, also, wrote, that, the, gods, would, grant, forgiveness, to, those, who, made, religious, sacrifice, socrates, suggests, that, they, use, the, city, as, an, image, to, seek, how, justice, comes, to, be, in, the, soul, of, an, individual, after, attributing, the, origin, of, society, to, the, individual, not, being, self, sufficient, and, having, many, needs, which, he, cannot, supply, himself, socrates, first, describes, a, healthy, state, made, up, of, producers, who, make, enough, for, a, modest, subsistence, but, glaucon, considers, this, hardly, different, than, a, city, of, pigs, socrates, then, goes, on, to, describe, the, luxurious, city, which, he, calls, a, fevered, state, acquiring, and, defending, these, luxuries, requires, a, guardian, class, to, wage, wars, they, then, explore, how, to, obtain, guardians, who, will, not, become, tyrants, to, the, people, they, guard, socrates, proposes, that, they, solve, the, problem, with, an, education, from, their, early, years, he, then, prescribes, the, necessary, education, beginning, with, the, kind, of, stories, that, are, appropriate, for, training, guardians, they, conclude, that, stories, that, ascribe, evil, to, the, gods, or, heroes, or, portray, the, afterlife, as, bad, are, untrue, and, should, not, be, taught, they, also, decide, to, regulate, narrative, and, musical, style, so, as, to, encourage, the, four, cardinal, virtues, wisdom, courage, justice, and, temperance, socrates, avers, that, beautiful, style, and, morally, good, style, are, the, same, in, proposing, their, program, of, censored, education, they, are, repurifying, the, luxurious, or, feverish, city, socrates, counters, the, objection, that, people, raised, in, censorship, will, be, too, naive, to, judge, concerning, vice, by, arguing, that, adults, can, learn, about, vice, once, their, character, has, been, formed, before, that, they, are, too, impressionable, to, encounter, vice, without, danger, they, suggest, that, the, second, part, of, the, guardians, education, should, be, in, gymnastics, with, physical, training, they, will, be, able, to, live, without, needing, frequent, medical, attention, physical, training, will, help, prevent, illness, and, weakness, socrates, claims, that, any, illness, requiring, constant, medical, attention, is, too, unhealthy, to, be, worth, living, by, analogy, any, society, that, requires, constant, litigation, is, too, unhealthy, to, be, worth, maintaining, socrates, asserts, that, both, male, and, female, guardians, be, given, the, same, education, that, all, wives, and, children, be, shared, and, that, they, be, prohibited, from, owning, private, property, so, that, guardians, will, not, become, possessive, and, keep, their, focus, on, the, good, of, the, whole, city, he, adds, a, third, class, distinction, between, auxiliaries, rank, and, file, soldiers, and, guardians, the, leaders, who, rule, the, city, in, the, fictional, tale, known, as, the, myth, or, parable, of, the, metals, socrates, presents, the, noble, lie, gennaion, pseudos, to, convince, everyone, in, the, city, to, perform, their, social, role, all, are, born, from, the, womb, of, their, mother, country, so, that, all, are, siblings, but, their, natures, are, different, each, containing, either, gold, guardians, silver, auxiliaries, or, bronze, or, iron, producers, if, anyone, with, a, bronze, or, iron, nature, rules, the, city, it, will, be, destroyed, socrates, claims, that, if, the, people, believed, this, myth, would, have, a, good, effect, making, them, more, inclined, to, care, for, the, state, and, one, another, socrates, claims, the, city, will, be, happiest, if, each, citizen, engages, in, the, occupation, that, suits, them, best, if, the, city, as, a, whole, is, happy, then, individuals, are, happy, in, the, physical, education, and, diet, of, the, guardians, the, emphasis, is, on, moderation, since, both, poverty, and, excessive, wealth, will, corrupt, them, 422a1, he, argues, that, a, city, without, wealth, can, defend, itself, successfully, against, wealthy, aggressors, socrates, says, that, it, is, pointless, to, worry, over, specific, laws, like, those, pertaining, to, contracts, since, proper, education, ensures, lawful, behavior, and, poor, education, causes, lawlessness, 425a, 425c, socrates, proceeds, to, search, for, wisdom, courage, and, temperance, in, the, city, on, the, grounds, that, justice, will, be, easier, to, discern, in, what, remains, 427e, they, find, wisdom, among, the, guardian, rulers, courage, among, the, guardian, warriors, or, auxiliaries, temperance, among, all, classes, of, the, city, in, agreeing, about, who, should, rule, and, who, should, be, ruled, finally, socrates, defines, justice, in, the, city, as, the, state, in, which, each, class, performs, only, its, own, work, not, meddling, in, the, work, of, the, other, classes, 433b, the, virtues, discovered, in, the, city, are, then, sought, in, the, individual, soul, for, this, purpose, socrates, creates, an, analogy, between, the, parts, of, the, city, and, the, soul, the, city, soul, analogy, he, argues, that, psychological, conflict, points, to, a, divided, soul, since, a, completely, unified, soul, could, not, behave, in, opposite, ways, towards, the, same, object, at, the, same, time, and, in, the, same, respect, 436b, he, gives, examples, of, possible, conflicts, between, the, rational, spirited, and, appetitive, parts, of, the, soul, corresponding, to, the, rulers, auxiliaries, and, producing, classes, in, the, city, having, established, the, tripartite, soul, socrates, defines, the, virtues, of, the, individual, a, person, is, wise, if, he, is, ruled, by, the, part, of, the, soul, that, knows, what, is, beneficial, for, each, part, and, for, the, whole, courageous, if, his, spirited, part, preserves, in, the, midst, of, pleasures, and, pains, the, decisions, reached, by, the, rational, part, and, temperate, if, the, three, parts, agree, that, the, rational, part, lead, 442c, d, they, are, just, if, each, part, of, the, soul, attends, to, its, function, and, not, the, function, of, another, it, follows, from, this, definition, that, one, cannot, be, just, if, one, does, not, have, the, other, cardinal, virtues, in, this, regard, plato, can, be, seen, as, a, progenitor, of, the, concept, of, social, structures, socrates, having, to, his, satisfaction, defined, the, just, constitution, of, both, city, and, psyche, moves, to, elaborate, upon, the, four, unjust, constitutions, of, these, adeimantus, and, polemarchus, interrupt, asking, socrates, instead, first, to, explain, how, the, sharing, of, wives, and, children, in, the, guardian, class, is, to, be, defined, and, legislated, a, theme, first, touched, on, in, book, iii, socrates, is, overwhelmed, at, their, request, categorizing, it, as, three, waves, of, attack, against, which, his, reasoning, must, stand, firm, these, three, waves, challenge, socrates, claims, that, in, books, v, vii, the, abolition, of, riches, among, the, guardian, class, not, unlike, max, weber, s, bureaucracy, leads, controversially, to, the, abandonment, of, the, typical, family, and, as, such, no, child, may, know, his, or, her, parents, and, the, parents, may, not, know, their, own, children, socrates, tells, a, tale, which, is, the, allegory, of, the, good, government, the, rulers, assemble, couples, for, reproduction, based, on, breeding, criteria, thus, stable, population, is, achieved, through, eugenics, and, social, cohesion, is, projected, to, be, high, because, familial, links, are, extended, towards, everyone, in, the, city, also, the, education, of, the, youth, is, such, that, they, are, taught, of, only, works, of, writing, that, encourage, them, to, improve, themselves, for, the, state, s, good, and, envision, the, god, s, as, entirely, good, just, and, the, author, s, of, only, that, which, is, good, socrates, argument, is, that, in, the, ideal, city, a, true, philosopher, with, understanding, of, forms, will, facilitate, the, harmonious, co, operation, of, all, the, citizens, of, the, city, the, governance, of, a, city, state, is, likened, to, the, command, of, a, ship, the, ship, of, state, this, philosopher, king, must, be, intelligent, reliable, and, willing, to, lead, a, simple, life, however, these, qualities, are, rarely, manifested, on, their, own, and, so, they, must, be, encouraged, through, education, and, the, study, of, the, good, the, allegory, of, the, cave, primarily, depicts, plato, s, distinction, between, the, world, of, appearances, and, the, real, world, of, the, forms, just, as, visible, objects, must, be, illuminated, in, order, to, be, seen, so, must, also, be, true, of, objects, of, knowledge, if, light, is, cast, on, them, plato, imagines, a, group, of, people, who, have, lived, their, entire, lives, as, prisoners, chained, to, the, wall, of, a, cave, in, the, subterranean, so, they, are, unable, to, see, the, outside, world, behind, them, however, a, constant, flame, illuminates, various, moving, objects, outside, which, are, silhouetted, on, the, wall, of, the, cave, visible, to, the, prisoners, these, prisoners, through, having, no, other, experience, of, reality, ascribe, forms, to, these, shadows, such, as, either, dog, or, cat, plato, then, goes, on, to, explain, how, the, philosopher, is, akin, to, a, prisoner, who, is, freed, from, the, cave, the, prisoner, is, initially, blinded, by, the, light, but, when, he, adjusts, to, the, brightness, he, sees, the, fire, and, the, statues, and, how, they, caused, the, images, witnessed, inside, the, cave, he, sees, that, the, fire, and, statues, in, the, cave, were, just, copies, of, the, real, objects, merely, imitations, this, is, analogous, to, the, forms, what, we, see, from, day, to, day, are, merely, appearances, reflections, of, the, forms, the, philosopher, however, will, not, be, deceived, by, the, shadows, and, will, hence, be, able, to, see, the, real, world, the, world, above, that, of, appearances, the, philosopher, will, gain, knowledge, of, things, in, themselves, at, the, end, of, this, allegory, plato, asserts, that, it, is, the, philosopher, s, burden, to, reenter, the, cave, those, who, have, seen, the, ideal, world, he, says, have, the, duty, to, educate, those, in, the, material, world, since, the, philosopher, recognizes, what, is, truly, good, only, he, is, fit, to, rule, society, according, to, plato, in, books, viii, ix, stand, plato, s, criticism, of, the, forms, of, government, plato, categorized, governments, into, five, types, of, regimes, aristocracy, timocracy, oligarchy, democracy, and, tyranny, the, starting, point, is, an, imagined, alternate, aristocracy, ruled, by, a, philosopher, king, a, just, government, ruled, by, a, philosopher, king, dominated, by, the, wisdom, loving, element, aristocracy, degenerates, into, timocracy, when, due, to, miscalculation, on, the, part, of, its, governing, class, the, next, generation, includes, persons, of, an, inferior, nature, inclined, not, just, to, cultivating, virtues, but, also, producing, wealth, in, a, timocracy, governors, will, apply, great, effort, in, gymnastics, and, the, arts, of, war, as, well, as, the, virtue, that, pertains, to, them, that, of, courage, as, the, emphasis, on, honor, is, compromised, by, wealth, accumulation, it, is, replaced, by, oligarchy, the, oligarchic, government, is, dominated, by, the, desiring, element, in, which, the, rich, are, the, ruling, class, oligarchs, do, however, value, at, least, one, virtue, that, of, temperance, and, moderation, not, out, of, an, ethical, principle, or, spiritual, concern, but, because, by, dominating, wasteful, tendencies, they, succeed, in, accumulating, money, as, this, socioeconomic, divide, grows, so, do, tensions, between, social, classes, from, the, conflicts, arising, out, of, such, tensions, the, poor, majority, overthrow, the, wealthy, minority, and, democracy, replaces, the, oligarchy, preceding, it, in, democracy, the, lower, class, grows, bigger, and, bigger, the, populism, of, the, democratic, government, leads, to, mob, rule, fueled, by, fear, of, oligarchy, which, a, clever, demagogue, can, exploit, to, take, power, and, establish, tyranny, where, no, one, has, discipline, and, society, exists, in, chaos, in, a, tyrannical, government, the, city, is, enslaved, to, the, tyrant, who, uses, his, guards, to, remove, the, best, social, elements, and, individuals, from, the, city, to, retain, power, since, they, pose, a, threat, while, leaving, the, worst, he, will, also, provoke, warfare, to, consolidate, his, position, as, leader, in, this, way, tyranny, is, the, most, unjust, regime, of, all, in, parallel, to, this, socrates, considers, the, individual, or, soul, that, corresponds, to, each, of, these, regimes, he, describes, how, an, aristocrat, may, become, weak, or, detached, from, political, and, material, affluence, and, how, his, son, will, respond, to, this, by, becoming, overly, ambitious, the, timocrat, in, turn, may, be, defeated, by, the, courts, or, vested, interests, his, son, responds, by, accumulating, wealth, in, order, to, gain, power, in, society, and, defend, himself, against, the, same, predicament, thereby, becoming, an, oligarch, the, oligarch, s, son, will, grow, up, with, wealth, without, having, to, practice, thrift, or, stinginess, and, will, be, tempted, and, overwhelmed, by, his, desires, so, that, he, becomes, democratic, valuing, freedom, above, all, the, democratic, man, is, torn, between, tyrannical, passions, and, oligarchic, discipline, and, ends, up, in, the, middle, ground, valuing, all, desires, both, good, and, bad, the, tyrant, will, be, tempted, in, the, same, way, as, the, democrat, but, without, an, upbringing, in, discipline, or, moderation, to, restrain, him, therefore, his, most, base, desires, and, wildest, passions, overwhelm, him, and, he, becomes, driven, by, lust, using, force, and, fraud, to, take, whatever, he, wants, the, tyrant, is, both, a, slave, to, his, lusts, and, a, master, to, whomever, he, can, enslave, socrates, points, out, the, human, tendency, to, be, corrupted, by, power, leads, down, the, road, to, timocracy, oligarchy, democracy, and, tyranny, from, this, he, concludes, that, ruling, should, be, left, to, philosophers, who, are, the, most, just, and, therefore, least, susceptible, to, corruption, this, good, city, is, depicted, as, being, governed, by, philosopher, kings, disinterested, persons, who, rule, not, for, their, personal, enjoyment, but, for, the, good, of, the, city, state, polis, the, philosophers, have, seen, the, forms, and, therefore, know, what, is, good, they, understand, the, corrupting, effect, of, greed, and, own, no, property, and, receive, no, salary, the, philosopher, kings, also, live, in, sober, communism, eating, and, sleeping, together, among, themselves, concluding, a, theme, brought, up, most, explicitly, in, the, analogies, of, the, sun, and, divided, line, in, book, vi, socrates, finally, rejects, any, form, of, imitative, art, and, concludes, that, such, artists, have, no, place, in, the, just, city, he, continues, on, to, argue, for, the, immortality, of, the, psyche, and, espouses, a, theory, of, reincarnation, he, finishes, by, detailing, the, rewards, of, being, just, both, in, this, life, and, the, next, artists, create, things, but, they, are, only, different, copies, of, the, idea, of, the, original, and, whenever, any, one, informs, us, that, he, has, found, a, man, who, knows, all, the, arts, and, all, things, else, that, anybody, knows, and, every, single, thing, with, a, higher, degree, of, accuracy, than, any, other, man, whoever, tells, us, this, i, think, that, we, can, only, imagine, to, be, a, simple, creature, who, is, likely, to, have, been, deceived, by, some, wizard, or, actor, whom, he, met, and, whom, he, thought, all, knowing, because, he, himself, was, unable, to, analyze, the, nature, of, knowledge, and, ignorance, and, imitation, and, the, same, object, appears, straight, when, looked, at, out, of, the, water, and, crooked, when, in, the, water, and, the, concave, becomes, convex, owing, to, the, illusion, about, colours, to, which, the, sight, is, liable, thus, every, sort, of, confusion, is, revealed, within, us, and, this, is, that, weakness, of, the, human, mind, on, which, the, art, of, conjuring, and, deceiving, by, light, and, shadow, and, other, ingenious, devices, imposes, having, an, effect, upon, us, like, magic, he, speaks, about, illusions, and, confusion, things, can, look, very, similar, but, be, different, in, reality, because, we, are, human, at, times, we, cannot, tell, the, difference, between, the, two, and, does, not, the, same, hold, also, of, the, ridiculous, there, are, jests, which, you, would, be, ashamed, to, make, yourself, and, yet, on, the, comic, stage, or, indeed, in, private, when, you, hear, them, you, are, greatly, amused, by, them, and, are, not, at, all, disgusted, at, their, unseemliness, the, case, of, pity, is, repeated, there, is, a, principle, in, human, nature, which, is, disposed, to, raise, a, laugh, and, this, which, you, once, restrained, by, reason, because, you, were, afraid, of, being, thought, a, buffoon, is, now, let, out, again, and, having, stimulated, the, risible, faculty, at, the, theatre, you, are, betrayed, unconsciously, to, yourself, into, playing, the, comic, poet, at, home, with, all, of, us, we, may, approve, of, something, as, long, we, are, not, directly, involved, with, it, if, we, joke, about, it, we, are, supporting, it, quite, true, he, said, and, the, same, may, be, said, of, lust, and, anger, and, all, the, other, affections, of, desire, and, pain, and, pleasure, which, are, held, to, be, inseparable, from, every, action, in, all, of, them, poetry, feeds, and, waters, the, passions, instead, of, drying, them, up, she, lets, them, rule, although, they, ought, to, be, controlled, if, mankind, are, ever, to, increase, in, happiness, and, virtue, sometimes, we, let, our, passions, rule, our, actions, or, way, of, thinking, although, they, should, be, controlled, so, that, we, can, increase, our, happiness, aristotle, systematises, many, of, plato, s, analyses, in, his, politics, and, criticizes, the, propositions, of, several, political, philosophers, for, the, ideal, city, state, zeno, of, citium, the, founder, of, stoicism, wrote, his, version, of, an, ideal, society, zeno, s, republic, in, opposition, to, plato, s, republic, zeno, s, republic, was, controversial, and, was, viewed, with, some, embarrassment, by, some, of, the, later, stoics, due, to, its, defenses, of, free, love, incest, and, cannibalism, and, due, to, its, opposition, to, ordinary, education, and, the, building, of, temples, law, courts, and, gymnasia, the, english, title, of, plato, s, dialogue, is, derived, from, cicero, s, de, re, publica, written, some, three, centuries, later, cicero, s, dialogue, imitates, plato, s, style, and, treats, many, of, the, same, topics, and, cicero, s, main, character, scipio, aemilianus, expresses, his, esteem, for, plato, and, socrates, augustine, of, hippo, wrote, his, the, city, of, god, augustine, equally, described, a, model, of, the, ideal, city, in, his, case, the, eternal, jerusalem, using, a, visionary, language, not, unlike, that, of, the, preceding, philosophers, islamic, philosophers, were, much, more, interested, in, aristotle, than, plato, but, not, having, access, to, aristotle, s, politics, ibn, rushd, averroes, produced, instead, a, commentary, on, plato, s, republic, he, advances, an, authoritarian, ideal, following, plato, s, paternalistic, model, absolute, monarchy, led, by, a, philosopher, king, creates, a, justly, ordered, society, this, requires, extensive, use, of, coercion, although, persuasion, is, preferred, and, is, possible, if, the, young, are, properly, raised, rhetoric, not, logic, is, the, appropriate, road, to, truth, for, the, common, man, demonstrative, knowledge, via, philosophy, and, logic, requires, special, study, rhetoric, aids, religion, in, reaching, the, masses, following, plato, ibn, rushd, accepts, the, principle, of, women, s, equality, they, should, be, educated, and, allowed, to, serve, in, the, military, the, best, among, them, might, be, tomorrow, s, philosophers, or, rulers, he, also, accepts, plato, s, illiberal, measures, such, as, the, censorship, of, literature, he, uses, examples, from, arab, history, to, illustrate, just, and, degenerate, political, orders, the, medieval, jurist, gratian, in, his, decretum, ca, 1140, quotes, plato, as, agreeing, with, him, that, by, natural, law, all, things, are, common, to, all, people, he, identifies, plato, s, ideal, society, with, the, early, church, as, described, in, the, acts, of, the, apostles, plato, lays, out, the, order, gratian, comments, for, a, very, just, republic, in, which, no, one, considers, anything, his, own, thomas, more, when, writing, his, utopia, invented, the, technique, of, using, the, portrayal, of, a, utopia, as, the, carrier, of, his, thoughts, about, the, ideal, society, more, s, island, utopia, is, also, similar, to, plato, s, republic, in, some, aspects, among, them, common, property, and, the, lack, of, privacy, hegel, respected, plato, s, theories, of, state, and, ethics, much, more, than, those, of, the, early, modern, philosophers, such, as, locke, hobbes, and, rousseau, whose, theories, proceeded, from, a, fictional, state, of, nature, defined, by, humanity, s, natural, needs, desires, and, freedom, for, hegel, this, was, a, contradiction, since, nature, and, the, individual, are, contradictory, the, freedoms, which, define, individuality, as, such, are, latecomers, on, the, stage, of, history, therefore, these, philosophers, unwittingly, projected, man, as, an, individual, in, modern, society, onto, a, primordial, state, of, nature, plato, however, had, managed, to, grasp, the, ideas, specific, to, his, time, plato, is, not, the, man, to, dabble, in, abstract, theories, and, principles, his, truth, loving, mind, has, recognized, and, represented, the, truth, of, the, world, in, which, he, lived, the, truth, of, the, one, spirit, that, lived, in, him, as, in, greece, itself, no, man, can, overleap, his, time, the, spirit, of, his, time, is, his, spirit, also, but, the, point, at, issue, is, to, recognize, that, spirit, by, its, content, for, hegel, plato, s, republic, is, not, an, abstract, theory, or, ideal, which, is, too, good, for, the, real, nature, of, man, but, rather, is, not, ideal, enough, not, good, enough, for, the, ideals, already, inherent, or, nascent, in, the, reality, of, his, time, a, time, when, greece, was, entering, decline, one, such, nascent, idea, was, about, to, crush, the, greek, way, of, life, modern, freedoms, or, christian, freedoms, in, hegel, s, view, such, as, the, individual, s, choice, of, his, social, class, or, of, what, property, to, pursue, or, which, career, to, follow, such, individual, freedoms, were, excluded, from, plato, s, republic, plato, recognized, and, caught, up, the, true, spirit, of, his, times, and, brought, it, forward, in, a, more, definite, way, in, that, he, desired, to, make, this, new, principle, an, impossibility, in, his, republic, greece, being, at, a, crossroads, plato, s, new, constitution, in, the, republic, was, an, attempt, to, preserve, greece, it, was, a, reactionary, reply, to, the, new, freedoms, of, private, property, etc, that, were, eventually, given, legal, form, through, rome, accordingly, in, ethical, life, it, was, an, attempt, to, introduce, a, religion, that, elevated, each, individual, not, as, an, owner, of, property, but, as, the, possessor, of, an, immortal, soul, mussolini, admired, plato, s, republic, which, he, often, read, for, inspiration, the, republic, expounded, a, number, of, ideas, that, fascism, promoted, such, as, rule, by, an, elite, promoting, the, state, as, the, ultimate, end, opposition, to, democracy, protecting, the, class, system, and, promoting, class, collaboration, rejection, of, egalitarianism, promoting, the, militarization, of, a, nation, by, creating, a, class, of, warriors, demanding, that, citizens, perform, civic, duties, in, the, interest, of, the, state, and, utilizing, state, intervention, in, education, to, promote, the, development, of, warriors, and, future, rulers, of, the, state, plato, was, an, idealist, focused, on, achieving, justice, and, morality, while, mussolini, and, fascism, were, realist, focused, on, achieving, political, goals, martin, luther, king, jr, nominated, the, republic, as, the, one, book, he, would, have, taken, to, a, desert, island, alongside, the, bible, in, 2001, a, survey, of, over, 1, 000, academics, and, students, voted, the, republic, the, greatest, philosophical, text, ever, written, julian, baggini, argued, that, although, the, work, was, wrong, on, almost, every, point, the, questions, it, raises, and, the, methods, it, uses, are, essential, to, the, western, tradition, of, philosophy, without, it, we, might, not, have, philosophy, as, we, know, it, in, 2021, a, survey, showed, that, the, republic, is, the, most, studied, book, in, the, top, universities, in, the, united, states, plato, s, republic, has, been, influential, in, literature, and, art, in, his, 1934, plato, und, die, dichter, plato, and, the, poets, as, well, as, several, other, works, hans, georg, gadamer, describes, the, utopic, city, of, the, republic, as, a, heuristic, utopia, that, should, not, be, pursued, or, even, be, used, as, an, orientation, point, for, political, development, rather, its, purpose, is, said, to, be, to, show, how, things, would, have, to, be, connected, and, how, one, thing, would, lead, to, another, often, with, highly, problematic, results, if, one, would, opt, for, certain, principles, and, carry, them, through, rigorously, this, interpretation, argues, that, large, passages, in, plato, s, writing, are, ironic, a, line, of, thought, initially, pursued, by, kierkegaard, the, city, portrayed, in, the, republic, struck, some, critics, as, harsh, rigid, and, unfree, indeed, as, totalitarian, karl, popper, gave, a, voice, to, that, view, in, his, 1945, book, the, open, society, and, its, enemies, where, he, singled, out, plato, s, state, as, a, dystopia, popper, distinguished, plato, s, ideas, from, those, of, socrates, claiming, that, the, former, in, his, later, years, expressed, none, of, the, humanitarian, and, democratic, tendencies, of, his, teacher, popper, thought, plato, s, envisioned, state, totalitarian, as, it, advocated, a, government, composed, only, of, a, distinct, hereditary, ruling, class, with, the, working, class, who, popper, argues, plato, regards, as, human, cattle, given, no, role, in, decision, making, he, argues, that, plato, has, no, interest, in, what, are, commonly, regarded, as, the, problems, of, justice, the, resolution, of, disputes, between, individuals, because, plato, has, redefined, justice, as, keeping, one, s, place, popper, insists, that, the, republic, was, meant, by, its, author, not, so, much, as, a, theoretical, treatise, but, as, a, topical, political, manifesto, and, bertrand, russell, argues, that, at, least, in, intent, and, all, in, all, not, so, far, from, what, was, possible, in, ancient, greek, city, states, the, form, of, government, portrayed, in, the, republic, was, meant, as, a, practical, one, by, plato, many, critics, have, suggested, that, the, dialogue, s, political, discussion, actually, serves, as, an, analogy, for, the, individual, soul, in, which, there, are, also, many, different, members, that, can, either, conflict, or, else, be, integrated, and, orchestrated, under, a, just, and, productive, government, among, other, things, this, analogical, reading, would, solve, the, problem, of, certain, implausible, statements, plato, makes, concerning, an, ideal, political, republic, norbert, bl, ssner, 2007, argues, that, the, republic, is, best, understood, as, an, analysis, of, the, workings, and, moral, improvement, of, the, individual, soul, with, remarkable, thoroughness, and, clarity, this, view, of, course, does, not, preclude, a, legitimate, reading, of, the, republic, as, a, political, treatise, the, work, could, operate, at, both, levels, it, merely, implies, that, it, deserves, more, attention, as, a, work, on, psychology, and, moral, philosophy, than, it, has, sometimes, received, eric, voegelin, in, plato, and, aristotle, baton, rouge, 1957, gave, meaning, to, the, concept, of, just, city, in, speech, books, ii, v, for, instance, there, is, evidence, in, the, dialogue, that, socrates, himself, would, not, be, a, member, of, his, ideal, state, his, life, was, almost, solely, dedicated, to, the, private, pursuit, of, knowledge, more, practically, socrates, suggests, that, members, of, the, lower, classes, could, rise, to, the, higher, ruling, class, and, vice, versa, if, they, had, gold, in, their, veins, a, version, of, the, concept, of, social, mobility, the, exercise, of, power, is, built, on, the, noble, lie, that, all, men, are, brothers, born, of, the, earth, yet, there, is, a, clear, hierarchy, and, class, divisions, there, is, a, tripartite, explanation, of, human, psychology, that, is, extrapolated, to, the, city, the, relation, among, peoples, there, is, no, family, among, the, guardians, another, crude, version, of, max, weber, s, concept, of, bureaucracy, as, the, state, non, private, concern, together, with, leo, strauss, voegelin, considered, popper, s, interpretation, to, be, a, gross, misunderstanding, not, only, of, the, dialogue, itself, but, of, the, very, nature, and, character, of, plato, s, entire, philosophic, enterprise, the, paradigm, of, the, city, the, idea, of, the, good, the, agathon, has, manifold, historical, embodiments, undertaken, by, those, who, have, seen, the, agathon, and, are, ordered, via, the, vision, the, centerpiece, of, the, republic, part, ii, nos, 2, 3, discusses, the, rule, of, the, philosopher, and, the, vision, of, the, agathon, with, the, allegory, of, the, cave, which, is, clarified, in, the, theory, of, forms, the, centerpiece, is, preceded, and, followed, by, the, discussion, of, the, means, that, will, secure, a, well, ordered, polis, city, part, ii, no, 1, concerns, marriage, the, community, of, people, and, goods, for, the, guardians, and, the, restraints, on, warfare, among, the, hellenes, it, describes, a, partially, communistic, polis, part, ii, no, 4, deals, with, the, philosophical, education, of, the, rulers, who, will, preserve, the, order, and, character, of, the, city, state, in, part, ii, the, embodiment, of, the, idea, is, preceded, by, the, establishment, of, the, economic, and, social, orders, of, a, polis, part, i, followed, by, an, analysis, part, iii, of, the, decline, the, order, must, traverse, the, three, parts, compose, the, main, body, of, the, dialogues, with, their, discussions, of, the, paradigm, its, embodiment, its, genesis, and, its, decline, the, introduction, and, the, conclusion, are, the, frame, for, the, body, of, the, republic, the, discussion, of, right, order, is, occasioned, by, the, questions, is, justice, better, than, injustice, and, will, an, unjust, man, fare, better, than, a, just, man, the, introductory, question, is, balanced, by, the, concluding, answer, justice, is, preferable, to, injustice, in, turn, the, foregoing, are, framed, with, the, prologue, book, i, and, the, epilogue, book, x, the, prologue, is, a, short, dialogue, about, the, common, public, doxai, opinions, about, justice, based, upon, faith, and, not, reason, the, epilogue, describes, the, new, arts, and, the, immortality, of, the, soul, some, of, plato, s, proposals, have, led, theorists, like, leo, strauss, and, allan, bloom, to, ask, readers, to, consider, the, possibility, that, socrates, was, creating, not, a, blueprint, for, a, real, city, but, a, learning, exercise, for, the, young, men, in, the, dialogue, there, are, many, points, in, the, construction, of, the, just, city, in, speech, that, seem, contradictory, which, raise, the, possibility, socrates, is, employing, irony, to, make, the, men, in, the, dialogue, question, for, themselves, the, ultimate, value, of, the, proposals, in, turn, plato, has, immortalized, this, learning, exercise, in, the, republic, one, of, many, examples, is, that, socrates, calls, the, marriages, of, the, ruling, class, sacred, however, they, last, only, one, night, and, are, the, result, of, manipulating, and, drugging, couples, into, predetermined, intercourse, with, the, aim, of, eugenically, breeding, guardian, warriors, strauss, and, bloom, s, interpretations, however, involve, more, than, just, pointing, out, inconsistencies, by, calling, attention, to, these, issues, they, ask, readers, to, think, more, deeply, about, whether, plato, is, being, ironic, or, genuine, for, neither, strauss, nor, bloom, present, an, unequivocal, opinion, preferring, to, raise, philosophic, doubt, over, interpretive, fact, strauss, s, approach, developed, out, of, a, belief, that, plato, wrote, esoterically, the, basic, acceptance, of, the, exoteric, esoteric, distinction, revolves, around, whether, plato, really, wanted, to, see, the, just, city, in, speech, of, books, v, vi, come, to, pass, or, whether, it, is, just, an, allegory, strauss, never, regarded, this, as, the, crucial, issue, of, the, dialogue, he, argued, against, karl, popper, s, literal, view, citing, cicero, s, opinion, that, the, republic, s, true, nature, was, to, bring, to, light, the, nature, of, political, things, in, fact, strauss, undermines, the, justice, found, in, the, just, city, in, speech, by, implying, the, city, is, not, natural, it, is, a, man, made, conceit, that, abstracts, away, from, the, erotic, needs, of, the, body, the, city, founded, in, the, republic, is, rendered, possible, by, the, abstraction, from, eros, an, argument, that, has, been, used, against, ascribing, ironic, intent, to, plato, is, that, plato, s, academy, produced, a, number, of, tyrants, who, seized, political, power, and, abandoned, philosophy, for, ruling, a, city, despite, being, well, versed, in, greek, and, having, direct, contact, with, plato, himself, some, of, plato, s, former, students, like, clearchus, tyrant, of, heraclea, chaeron, tyrant, of, pellene, erastus, and, coriscus, tyrants, of, skepsis, hermias, of, atarneus, and, assos, and, calippus, tyrant, of, syracuse, ruled, people, and, did, not, impose, anything, like, a, philosopher, kingship, however, it, can, be, argued, whether, these, men, became, tyrants, through, studying, in, the, academy, plato, s, school, had, an, elite, student, body, some, of, whom, would, by, birth, and, family, expectation, end, up, in, the, seats, of, power, additionally, it, is, important, that, it, is, by, no, means, obvious, that, these, men, were, tyrants, in, the, modern, totalitarian, sense, of, the, concept, finally, since, very, little, is, actually, known, about, what, was, taught, at, plato, s, academy, there, is, no, small, controversy, over, whether, it, was, even, in, the, business, of, teaching, politics, at, all, several, oxyrhynchus, papyri, fragments, were, found, to, contain, parts, of, the, republic, and, from, other, works, such, as, phaedo, or, the, dialogue, gorgias, written, around, 200, 300, ce, fragments, of, a, different, version, of, plato, s, republic, were, discovered, in, 1945, part, of, the, nag, hammadi, library, written, c, 350, ce, these, findings, highlight, the, influence, of, plato, during, those, times, in, egypt
