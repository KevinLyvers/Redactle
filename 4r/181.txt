pleads, with, him, to, reinstate, krogstad, claiming, she, is, worried, krogstad, will, publish, libelous, articles, about, torvald, and, ruin, his, career, torvald, dismisses, her, fears, and, explains, that, although, krogstad, is, a, good, worker, and, seems, to, have, turned, his, life, around, he, must, be, fired, because, he, is, too, familiar, around, torvald, in, front, of, other, bank, personnel, torvald, then, retires, to, his, study, to, work, dr, rank, then, arrives, nora, asks, him, for, a, favor, but, rank, responds, by, revealing, that, he, has, entered, the, terminal, stage, of, his, disease, and, that, he, has, always, been, secretly, in, love, with, her, nora, tries, to, deny, the, first, revelation, and, make, light, of, it, but, is, more, disturbed, by, his, declaration, of, love, she, then, clumsily, attempts, to, tell, him, that, she, is, not, in, love, with, him, but, loves, him, dearly, as, a, friend, having, been, fired, by, torvald, krogstad, arrives, at, the, house, nora, convinces, dr, rank, to, go, into, torvald, s, study, so, he, will, not, see, krogstad, when, krogstad, confronts, nora, he, declares, that, he, no, longer, cares, about, the, remaining, balance, of, nora, s, loan, but, that, he, will, instead, preserve, the, associated, bond, to, blackmail, torvald, into, not, only, keeping, him, employed, but, also, promoting, him, nora, explains, that, she, has, done, her, best, to, persuade, her, husband, but, he, refuses, to, change, his, mind, krogstad, informs, nora, that, he, has, written, a, letter, detailing, her, crime, forging, her, father, s, signature, of, surety, on, the, bond, and, put, it, in, torvald, s, mailbox, which, is, locked, nora, tells, kristine, of, her, difficult, situation, gives, her, krogstad, s, card, with, his, address, and, asks, her, to, try, to, convince, him, to, relent, torvald, enters, and, tries, to, retrieve, his, mail, but, nora, distracts, him, by, begging, him, to, help, her, with, the, dance, she, has, been, rehearsing, for, the, costume, party, feigning, anxiety, about, performing, she, dances, so, badly, and, acts, so, childishly, that, torvald, agrees, to, spend, the, whole, evening, coaching, her, when, the, others, go, to, dinner, nora, stays, behind, for, a, few, minutes, and, contemplates, killing, herself, kristine, tells, krogstad, that, she, only, married, her, husband, because, she, had, no, other, means, to, support, her, sick, mother, and, young, siblings, and, that, she, has, returned, to, offer, him, her, love, again, she, believes, that, he, would, not, have, stooped, to, unethical, behavior, if, he, had, not, been, devastated, by, her, abandonment, and, in, dire, financial, straits, krogstad, changes, his, mind, and, offers, to, take, back, his, letter, from, torvald, kristine, however, decides, that, torvald, should, know, the, truth, for, the, sake, of, his, and, nora, s, marriage, after, torvald, literally, drags, nora, home, from, the, party, rank, follows, them, they, chat, for, a, while, with, dr, rank, conveying, obliquely, to, nora, that, this, is, a, final, goodbye, as, he, has, determined, that, his, death, is, near, dr, rank, leaves, and, torvald, retrieves, his, letters, as, he, reads, them, nora, prepares, to, run, away, for, good, but, torvald, confronts, her, with, krogstad, s, letter, enraged, he, declares, that, she, is, now, completely, in, krogstad, s, power, she, must, yield, to, krogstad, s, demands, and, keep, quiet, about, the, whole, affair, he, berates, nora, calling, her, a, dishonest, and, immoral, woman, and, telling, her, that, she, is, unfit, to, raise, their, children, he, says, that, from, now, on, their, marriage, will, be, only, a, matter, of, appearances, a, maid, enters, delivering, a, letter, from, krogstad, to, nora, which, torvald, demands, to, read, himself, torvald, then, exults, that, he, is, saved, as, krogstad, has, returned, the, incriminating, bond, which, torvald, immediately, burns, along, with, krogstad, s, letters, he, takes, back, his, harsh, words, to, his, wife, and, tells, her, that, he, forgives, her, nora, realizes, that, her, husband, is, not, the, strong, and, gallant, man, she, thought, he, was, and, that, he, truly, loves, himself, more, than, he, does, nora, torvald, explains, that, when, a, man, has, forgiven, his, wife, it, makes, him, love, her, all, the, more, since, it, reminds, him, that, she, is, totally, dependent, on, him, like, a, child, he, preserves, his, peace, of, mind, by, thinking, of, the, incident, as, a, mere, mistake, that, she, made, owing, to, her, foolishness, one, of, her, most, endearing, feminine, traits, torvald, this, is, a, settling, of, accounts, in, all, these, eight, years, we, have, never, exchanged, a, word, on, any, serious, subject, nora, in, ibsen, s, a, doll, s, house, 1879, nora, tells, torvald, that, she, is, leaving, him, and, in, a, confrontational, scene, expresses, her, sense, of, betrayal, and, disillusionment, she, says, he, has, never, loved, her, and, they, have, become, strangers, to, each, other, she, feels, betrayed, by, his, response, to, the, scandal, involving, krogstad, and, she, says, she, must, get, away, to, understand, herself, she, says, that, she, has, been, treated, like, a, doll, to, play, with, for, her, whole, life, first, by, her, father, and, then, by, him, torvald, insists, that, she, fulfill, her, duty, as, a, wife, and, mother, but, nora, says, that, she, has, duties, to, herself, that, are, just, as, important, and, that, she, cannot, be, a, good, mother, or, wife, without, learning, to, be, more, than, a, plaything, she, reveals, that, she, had, expected, that, he, would, want, to, sacrifice, his, reputation, for, hers, and, that, she, had, planned, to, kill, herself, to, prevent, him, from, doing, so, she, now, realizes, that, torvald, is, not, at, all, the, kind, of, person, she, had, believed, him, to, be, and, that, their, marriage, has, been, based, on, mutual, fantasies, and, misunderstandings, nora, leaves, her, keys, and, wedding, ring, torvald, breaks, down, and, begins, to, cry, baffled, by, what, has, happened, after, nora, leaves, the, room, torvald, for, one, second, still, has, a, sense, of, hope, and, exclaims, to, himself, the, most, wonderful, thing, of, all, just, before, the, door, downstairs, is, heard, closing, ibsen, s, german, agent, felt, that, the, original, ending, would, not, play, well, in, german, theaters, in, addition, copyright, laws, of, the, time, would, not, preserve, ibsen, s, original, work, therefore, for, it, to, be, considered, acceptable, and, prevent, the, translator, from, altering, his, work, ibsen, was, forced, to, write, an, alternative, ending, for, the, german, premiere, in, this, ending, nora, is, led, to, her, children, after, having, argued, with, torvald, seeing, them, she, collapses, and, as, the, curtain, is, brought, down, it, is, implied, that, she, stays, ibsen, later, called, the, ending, a, disgrace, to, the, original, play, and, referred, to, it, as, a, barbaric, outrage, virtually, all, productions, today, use, the, original, ending, as, do, nearly, all, the, film, versions, of, the, play, a, doll, s, house, was, based, on, the, life, of, laura, kieler, maiden, name, laura, smith, petersen, a, good, friend, of, ibsen, much, that, happened, between, nora, and, torvald, happened, to, laura, and, her, husband, victor, similar, to, the, events, in, the, play, laura, signed, an, illegal, loan, to, save, her, husband, s, life, in, this, case, to, find, a, cure, for, his, tuberculosis, she, wrote, to, ibsen, asking, for, his, recommendation, of, her, work, to, his, publisher, thinking, that, the, sales, of, her, book, would, repay, her, debt, at, his, refusal, she, forged, a, check, for, the, money, at, this, point, she, was, found, out, in, real, life, when, victor, discovered, laura, s, secret, loan, he, divorced, her, and, had, her, committed, to, an, asylum, two, years, later, she, returned, to, her, husband, and, children, at, his, urging, and, she, went, on, to, become, a, well, known, danish, author, living, to, the, age, of, 83, ibsen, wrote, a, doll, s, house, when, laura, kieler, had, been, committed, to, the, asylum, the, fate, of, this, friend, of, the, family, shook, him, deeply, perhaps, also, because, laura, had, asked, him, to, intervene, at, a, crucial, point, in, the, scandal, which, he, did, not, feel, able, or, willing, to, do, instead, he, turned, this, life, situation, into, an, aesthetically, shaped, successful, drama, in, the, play, nora, leaves, torvald, with, head, held, high, though, facing, an, uncertain, future, given, the, limitations, single, women, faced, in, the, society, of, the, time, kieler, eventually, rebounded, from, the, shame, of, the, scandal, and, had, her, own, successful, writing, career, while, remaining, discontented, with, sole, recognition, as, ibsen, s, nora, years, afterward, ibsen, started, thinking, about, the, play, around, may, 1878, although, he, did, not, begin, its, first, draft, until, a, year, later, having, reflected, on, the, themes, and, characters, in, the, intervening, period, he, visualized, its, protagonist, nora, for, instance, as, having, approached, him, one, day, wearing, a, blue, woolen, dress, he, outlined, his, conception, of, the, play, as, a, modern, tragedy, in, a, note, written, in, rome, on, 19, october, 1878, a, woman, cannot, be, herself, in, modern, society, he, argues, since, it, is, an, exclusively, male, society, with, laws, made, by, men, and, with, prosecutors, and, judges, who, assess, feminine, conduct, from, a, masculine, standpoint, ibsen, sent, a, fair, copy, of, the, completed, play, to, his, publisher, on, 15, september, 1879, it, was, first, published, in, copenhagen, on, 4, december, 1879, in, an, edition, of, 8, 000, copies, that, sold,

norwegian, newspaper, folkets, avis, the, critic, erik, b, gh, admired, ibsen, s, originality, and, technical, mastery, not, a, single, declamatory, phrase, no, high, dramatics, no, drop, of, blood, not, even, a, tear, every, performance, of, its, run, was, sold, out, another, production, opened, at, the, royal, dramatic, theatre, in, stockholm, on, 8, january, 1880, while, productions, in, christiania, with, johanne, juell, as, nora, and, arnoldus, reimers, as, torvald, and, bergen, followed, shortly, after, in, germany, the, actress, hedwig, raabe, refused, to, perform, the, play, as, written, declaring, i, would, never, leave, my, children, since, the, playwright, s, wishes, were, not, protected, by, copyright, ibsen, decided, to, avoid, the, danger, of, being, rewritten, by, a, lesser, dramatist, by, committing, what, he, called, a, barbaric, outrage, on, his, play, himself, and, giving, it, an, alternative, ending, in, which, nora, did, not, leave, a, production, of, this, version, opened, in, flensburg, in, february, 1880, this, version, was, also, played, in, hamburg, dresden, hanover, and, berlin, although, in, the, wake, of, protests, and, a, lack, of, success, raabe, eventually, restored, the, original, ending, another, production, of, the, original, version, some, rehearsals, of, which, ibsen, attended, opened, on, 3, march, 1880, at, the, residence, theatre, in, munich, in, great, britain, the, only, way, in, which, the, play, was, initially, allowed, to, be, given, in, london, was, in, an, adaptation, by, henry, arthur, jones, and, henry, herman, called, breaking, a, butterfly, this, adaptation, was, produced, at, the, princess, theatre, on, 3, march, 1884, writing, in, 1896, in, his, book, the, foundations, of, a, national, drama, jones, says, a, rough, translation, from, the, german, version, of, a, doll, s, house, was, put, into, my, hands, and, i, was, told, that, if, it, could, be, turned, into, a, sympathetic, play, a, ready, opening, would, be, found, for, it, on, the, london, boards, i, knew, nothing, of, ibsen, but, i, knew, a, great, deal, of, robertson, and, h, j, byron, from, these, circumstances, came, the, adaptation, called, breaking, a, butterfly, h, l, mencken, writes, that, it, was, a, doll, s, house, denaturized, and, dephlogisticated, toward, the, middle, of, the, action, ibsen, was, thrown, to, the, fishes, and, nora, was, saved, from, suicide, rebellion, flight, and, immorality, by, making, a, faithful, old, clerk, steal, her, fateful, promissory, note, from, krogstad, s, desk, the, curtain, fell, upon, a, happy, home, before, 1889, there, were, two, private, productions, of, the, play, in, london, in, its, original, form, as, ibsen, wrote, it, in, 1886, the, first, production,

traditional, roles, of, men, and, women, in, 19th, century, marriage, to, many, 19th, century, europeans, this, was, scandalous, the, covenant, of, marriage, was, considered, holy, and, to, portray, it, as, ibsen, did, was, controversial, the, irish, playwright, george, bernard, shaw, however, found, ibsen, s, willingness, to, examine, society, without, prejudice, exhilarating, the, swedish, playwright, august, strindberg, criticised, the, play, in, his, volume, of, essays, and, short, stories, getting, married, 1884, strindberg, questioned, nora, s, walking, out, and, leaving, her, children, behind, with, a, man, that, she, herself, disapproved, of, so, much, that, she, would, not, remain, with, him, strindberg, also, considers, that, nora, s, involvement, with, an, illegal, financial, fraud, that, involved, nora, forging, a, signature, all, done, behind, her, husband, s, back, and, then, nora, s, lying, to, her, husband, regarding, krogstad, s, blackmail, are, serious, crimes, that, should, raise, questions, at, the, end, of, the, play, when, nora, is, moralistically, judging, her, husband, strindberg, also, points, out, that, nora, s, complaint, that, she, and,
