neoclassicism, also, spelled, neo, classicism, emerged, as, a, western, cultural, movement, in, the, decorative, and, visual, arts, literature, theatre, music, and, architecture, that, drew, inspiration, from, the, art, and, culture, of, classical, antiquity, neoclassicism, was, born, in, rome, largely, due, to, the, writings, of, johann, joachim, winckelmann, during, the, rediscovery, of, pompeii, and, herculaneum, its, popularity, expanded, throughout, europe, as, a, generation, of, european, art, students, finished, their, grand, tour, and, returned, from, italy, to, their, home, countries, with, newly, rediscovered, greco, roman, ideals, the, main, neoclassical, movement, coincided, with, the, 18th, century, age, of, enlightenment, and, continued, into, the, early, 19th, century, eventually, competing, with, romanticism, in, architecture, the, style, endured, throughout, the, 19th, 20th, and, into, the, 21st, century, european, neoclassicism, in, the, visual, arts, began, c, 1760, in, opposition, to, the, then, dominant, rococo, style, rococo, architecture, emphasizes, grace, ornamentation, and, asymmetry, neoclassical, architecture, is, based, on, the, principles, of, simplicity, and, symmetry, which, were, seen, as, virtues, of, the, arts, of, ancient, rome, and, ancient, greece, and, drawn, directly, from, 16th, century, renaissance, classicism, each, neo, classicism, movement, selects, some, models, among, the, range, of, possible, classics, that, are, available, to, it, and, ignores, others, between, 1765, and, 1830, neoclassical, proponents, writers, speakers, patrons, collectors, artists, and, sculptors, paid, homage, to, an, idea, of, the, artistic, generation, associated, with, phidias, but, sculpture, examples, they, actually, embraced, were, more, likely, to, be, roman, copies, of, hellenistic, sculptures, they, ignored, both, archaic, greek, art, and, the, works, of, late, antiquity, the, discovery, of, ancient, palmyra, s, rococo, art, through, engravings, in, robert, wood, s, the, ruins, of, palmyra, came, as, a, revelation, with, greece, largely, unexplored, and, considered, a, dangerous, territory, of, the, ottoman, empire, neoclassicists, appreciation, of, greek, architecture, was, predominantly, mediated, through, drawings, and, engravings, which, were, subtly, smoothed, and, regularized, corrected, and, restored, monuments, of, greece, not, always, consciously, the, empire, style, a, second, phase, of, neoclassicism, in, architecture, and, the, decorative, arts, had, its, cultural, centre, in, paris, in, the, napoleonic, era, especially, in, architecture, but, also, in, other, fields, neoclassicism, remained, a, force, long, after, the, early, 19th, century, with, periodic, waves, of, revivalism, into, the, 20th, and, even, the, 21st, centuries, especially, in, the, united, states, and, russia, neoclassicism, is, a, revival, of, the, many, styles, and, spirit, of, classic, antiquity, inspired, directly, from, the, classical, period, which, coincided, and, reflected, the, developments, in, philosophy, and, other, areas, of, the, age, of, enlightenment, and, was, initially, a, reaction, against, the, excesses, of, the, preceding, rococo, style, while, the, movement, is, often, described, as, the, opposed, counterpart, of, romanticism, this, is, a, great, over, simplification, that, tends, not, to, be, sustainable, when, specific, artists, or, works, are, considered, the, case, of, the, supposed, main, champion, of, late, neoclassicism, ingres, demonstrates, this, especially, well, the, revival, can, be, traced, to, the, establishment, of, formal, archaeology, the, writings, of, johann, joachim, winckelmann, were, important, in, shaping, this, movement, in, both, architecture, and, the, visual, arts, his, books, thoughts, on, the, imitation, of, greek, works, in, painting, and, sculpture, 1750, and, geschichte, der, kunst, des, alterthums, history, of, ancient, art, 1764, were, the, first, to, distinguish, sharply, between, ancient, greek, and, roman, art, and, define, periods, within, greek, art, tracing, a, trajectory, from, growth, to, maturity, and, then, imitation, or, decadence, that, continues, to, have, influence, to, the, present, day, winckelmann, believed, that, art, should, aim, at, noble, simplicity, and, calm, grandeur, and, praised, the, idealism, of, greek, art, in, which, he, said, we, find, not, only, nature, at, its, most, beautiful, but, also, something, beyond, nature, namely, certain, ideal, forms, of, its, beauty, which, as, an, ancient, interpreter, of, plato, teaches, us, come, from, images, created, by, the, mind, alone, the, theory, was, very, far, from, new, in, western, art, but, his, emphasis, on, close, copying, of, greek, models, was, the, only, way, for, us, to, become, great, or, if, this, be, possible, inimitable, is, to, imitate, the, ancients, the, industrial, revolution, saw, global, transition, of, human, economy, towards, more, efficient, and, stable, manufacturing, processes, there, was, tremendous, material, advancement, and, increased, prosperity, with, the, advent, of, the, grand, tour, a, fad, of, collecting, antiquities, began, that, laid, the, foundations, of, many, great, collections, spreading, a, neoclassical, revival, throughout, europe, neoclassicism, in, each, art, implies, a, particular, canon, of, a, classical, model, in, english, the, term, neoclassicism, is, used, primarily, of, the, visual, arts, the, similar, movement, in, english, literature, which, began, considerably, earlier, is, called, augustan, literature, this, which, had, been, dominant, for, several, decades, was, beginning, to, decline, by, the, time, neoclassicism, in, the, visual, arts, became, fashionable, though, terms, differ, the, situation, in, french, literature, was, similar, in, music, the, period, saw, the, rise, of, classical, music, and, neoclassicism, is, used, of, 20th, century, developments, however, the, operas, of, christoph, willibald, gluck, represented, a, specifically, neoclassical, approach, spelt, out, in, his, preface, to, the, published, score, of, alceste, 1769, which, aimed, to, reform, opera, by, removing, ornamentation, increasing, the, role, of, the, chorus, in, line, with, greek, tragedy, and, using, simpler, unadorned, melodic, lines, the, term, neoclassical, was, not, invented, until, the, mid, 19th, century, and, at, the, time, the, style, was, described, by, such, terms, as, the, true, style, reformed, and, revival, what, was, regarded, as, being, revived, varying, considerably, ancient, models, were, certainly, very, much, involved, but, the, style, could, also, be, regarded, as, a, revival, of, the, renaissance, and, especially, in, france, as, a, return, to, the, more, austere, and, noble, baroque, of, the, age, of, louis, xiv, for, which, a, considerable, nostalgia, had, developed, as, france, s, dominant, military, and, political, position, started, a, serious, decline, ingres, s, coronation, portrait, of, napoleon, even, borrowed, from, late, antique, consular, diptychs, and, their, carolingian, revival, to, the, disapproval, of, critics, neoclassicism, was, strongest, in, architecture, sculpture, and, the, decorative, arts, where, classical, models, in, the, same, medium, were, relatively, numerous, and, accessible, examples, from, ancient, painting, that, demonstrated, the, qualities, that, winckelmann, s, writing, found, in, sculpture, were, and, are, lacking, winckelmann, was, involved, in, the, dissemination, of, knowledge, of, the, first, large, roman, paintings, to, be, discovered, at, pompeii, and, herculaneum, and, like, most, contemporaries, except, for, gavin, hamilton, was, unimpressed, by, them, citing, pliny, the, younger, s, comments, on, the, decline, of, painting, in, his, period, as, for, painting, greek, painting, was, utterly, lost, neoclassicist, painters, imaginatively, revived, it, partly, through, bas, relief, friezes, mosaics, and, pottery, painting, and, partly, through, the, examples, of, painting, and, decoration, of, the, high, renaissance, of, raphael, s, generation, frescos, in, nero, s, domus, aurea, pompeii, and, herculaneum, and, through, renewed, admiration, of, nicolas, poussin, much, neoclassical, painting, is, more, classicizing, in, subject, matter, than, in, anything, else, a, fierce, but, often, very, badly, informed, dispute, raged, for, decades, over, the, relative, merits, of, greek, and, roman, art, with, winckelmann, and, his, fellow, hellenists, generally, being, on, the, winning, side, it, is, hard, to, recapture, the, radical, and, exciting, nature, of, early, neoclassical, painting, for, contemporary, audiences, it, now, strikes, even, those, writers, favourably, inclined, to, it, as, insipid, and, almost, entirely, uninteresting, to, us, some, of, kenneth, clark, s, comments, on, anton, raphael, mengs, ambitious, parnassus, at, the, villa, albani, by, the, artist, whom, his, friend, winckelmann, described, as, the, greatest, artist, of, his, own, and, perhaps, of, later, times, the, drawings, subsequently, turned, into, prints, of, john, flaxman, used, very, simple, line, drawing, thought, to, be, the, purest, classical, medium, and, figures, mostly, in, profile, to, depict, the, odyssey, and, other, subjects, and, once, fired, the, artistic, youth, of, europe, but, are, now, neglected, while, the, history, paintings, of, angelica, kauffman, mainly, a, portraitist, are, described, as, having, an, unctuous, softness, and, tediousness, by, fritz, novotny, rococo, frivolity, and, baroque, movement, had, been, stripped, away, but, many, artists, struggled, to, put, anything, in, their, place, and, in, the, absence, of, ancient, examples, for, history, painting, other, than, the, greek, vases, used, by, flaxman, raphael, tended, to, be, used, as, a, substitute, model, as, winckelmann, recommended, the, work, of, other, artists, who, could, not, easily, be, described, as, insipid, combined, aspects, of, romanticism, with, a, generally, neoclassical, style, and, form, part, of, the, history, of, both, movements, the, german, danish, painter, asmus, jacob, carstens, finished, very, few, of, the, large, mythological, works, that, he, planned, leaving, mostly, drawings, and, colour, studies, which, often, succeed, in, approaching, winckelmann, s, prescription, of, noble, simplicity, and, calm, grandeur, unlike, carstens, unrealized, schemes, the, etchings, of, giovanni, battista, piranesi, were, numerous, and, profitable, and, taken, back, by, those, making, the, grand, tour, to, all, parts, of, europe, his, main, subject, matter, was, the, buildings, and, ruins, of, rome, and, he, was, more, stimulated, by, the, ancient, than, the, modern, the, somewhat, disquieting, atmosphere, of, many, of, his, vedute, views, becomes, dominant, in, his, series, of, 16, prints, of, carceri, d, invenzione, imaginary, prisons, whose, oppressive, cyclopean, architecture, conveys, dreams, of, fear, and, frustration, the, swiss, born, henry, fuseli, spent, most, of, his, career, in, england, and, while, his, fundamental, style, was, based, on, neoclassical, principles, his, subjects, and, treatment, more, often, reflected, the, gothic, strain, of, romanticism, and, sought, to, evoke, drama, and, excitement, neoclassicism, in, painting, gained, a, new, sense, of, direction, with, the, sensational, success, of, jacques, louis, david, s, oath, of, the, horatii, at, the, paris, salon, of, 1785, despite, its, evocation, of, republican, virtues, this, was, a, commission, by, the, royal, government, which, david, insisted, on, painting, in, rome, david, managed, to, combine, an, idealist, style, with, drama, and, forcefulness, the, central, perspective, is, perpendicular, to, the, picture, plane, made, more, emphatic, by, the, dim, arcade, behind, against, which, the, heroic, figures, are, disposed, as, in, a, frieze, with, a, hint, of, the, artificial, lighting, and, staging, of, opera, and, the, classical, colouring, of, nicolas, poussin, david, rapidly, became, the, leader, of, french, art, and, after, the, french, revolution, became, a, politician, with, control, of, much, government, patronage, in, art, he, managed, to, retain, his, influence, in, the, napoleonic, period, turning, to, frankly, propagandistic, works, but, had, to, leave, france, for, exile, in, brussels, at, the, bourbon, restoration, david, s, many, students, included, jean, auguste, dominique, ingres, who, saw, himself, as, a, classicist, throughout, his, long, career, despite, a, mature, style, that, has, an, equivocal, relationship, with, the, main, current, of, neoclassicism, and, many, later, diversions, into, orientalism, and, the, troubadour, style, that, are, hard, to, distinguish, from, those, of, his, unabashedly, romantic, contemporaries, except, by, the, primacy, his, works, always, give, to, drawing, he, exhibited, at, the, salon, for, over, 60, years, from, 1802, into, the, beginnings, of, impressionism, but, his, style, once, formed, changed, little, if, neoclassical, painting, suffered, from, a, lack, of, ancient, models, neoclassical, sculpture, tended, to, suffer, from, an, excess, of, them, although, examples, of, actual, greek, sculpture, of, the, classical, period, beginning, in, about, 500, bc, were, then, very, few, the, most, highly, regarded, works, were, mostly, roman, copies, the, leading, neoclassical, sculptors, enjoyed, huge, reputations, in, their, own, day, but, are, now, less, regarded, with, the, exception, of, jean, antoine, houdon, whose, work, was, mainly, portraits, very, often, as, busts, which, do, not, sacrifice, a, strong, impression, of, the, sitter, s, personality, to, idealism, his, style, became, more, classical, as, his, long, career, continued, and, represents, a, rather, smooth, progression, from, rococo, charm, to, classical, dignity, unlike, some, neoclassical, sculptors, he, did, not, insist, on, his, sitters, wearing, roman, dress, or, being, unclothed, he, portrayed, most, of, the, notable, figures, of, the, enlightenment, and, travelled, to, america, to, produce, a, statue, of, george, washington, as, well, as, busts, of, thomas, jefferson, benjamin, franklin, and, other, founders, of, the, new, republic, antonio, canova, and, the, dane, bertel, thorvaldsen, were, both, based, in, rome, and, as, well, as, portraits, produced, many, ambitious, life, size, figures, and, groups, both, represented, the, strongly, idealizing, tendency, in, neoclassical, sculpture, canova, has, a, lightness, and, grace, where, thorvaldsen, is, more, severe, the, difference, is, exemplified, in, their, respective, groups, of, the, three, graces, all, these, and, flaxman, were, still, active, in, the, 1820s, and, romanticism, was, slow, to, impact, sculpture, where, versions, of, neoclassicism, remained, the, dominant, style, for, most, of, the, 19th, century, an, early, neoclassicist, in, sculpture, was, the, swede, johan, tobias, sergel, john, flaxman, was, also, or, mainly, a, sculptor, mostly, producing, severely, classical, reliefs, that, are, comparable, in, style, to, his, prints, he, also, designed, and, modelled, neoclassical, ceramics, for, josiah, wedgwood, for, several, years, johann, gottfried, schadow, and, his, son, rudolph, one, of, the, few, neoclassical, sculptors, to, die, young, were, the, leading, german, artists, with, franz, anton, von, zauner, in, austria, the, late, baroque, austrian, sculptor, franz, xaver, messerschmidt, turned, to, neoclassicism, in, mid, career, shortly, before, he, appears, to, have, suffered, some, kind, of, mental, crisis, after, which, he, retired, to, the, country, and, devoted, himself, to, the, highly, distinctive, character, heads, of, bald, figures, pulling, extreme, facial, expressions, like, piranesi, s, carceri, these, enjoyed, a, great, revival, of, interest, during, the, age, of, psychoanalysis, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, dutch, neoclassical, sculptor, mathieu, kessels, studied, with, thorvaldsen, and, worked, almost, exclusively, in, rome, since, prior, to, the, 1830s, the, united, states, did, not, have, a, sculpture, tradition, of, its, own, save, in, the, areas, of, tombstones, weathervanes, and, ship, figureheads, the, european, neoclassical, manner, was, adopted, there, and, it, was, to, hold, sway, for, decades, and, is, exemplified, in, the, sculptures, of, horatio, greenough, harriet, hosmer, hiram, powers, randolph, rogers, and, william, henry, rinehart, neoclassical, art, was, traditional, and, new, historical, and, modern, conservative, and, progressive, all, at, the, same, time, neoclassicism, first, gained, influence, in, britain, and, france, through, a, generation, of, french, art, students, trained, in, rome, and, influenced, by, the, writings, of, winckelmann, and, it, was, quickly, adopted, by, progressive, circles, in, other, countries, such, as, sweden, poland, and, russia, at, first, classicizing, decor, was, grafted, onto, familiar, european, forms, as, in, the, interiors, for, catherine, the, great, s, lover, count, grigory, orlov, designed, by, an, italian, architect, with, a, team, of, italian, stuccadori, only, the, isolated, oval, medallions, like, cameos, and, the, bas, relief, overdoors, hint, of, neoclassicism, the, furnishings, are, fully, italian, rococo, a, second, neoclassic, wave, more, severe, more, studied, through, the, medium, of, engravings, and, more, consciously, archaeological, is, associated, with, the, height, of, the, napoleonic, empire, in, france, the, first, phase, of, neoclassicism, was, expressed, in, the, louis, xvi, style, and, the, second, in, the, styles, called, directoire, and, empire, the, rococo, style, remained, popular, in, italy, until, the, napoleonic, regimes, brought, the, new, archaeological, classicism, which, was, embraced, as, a, political, statement, by, young, progressive, urban, italians, with, republican, leanings, in, the, decorative, arts, neoclassicism, is, exemplified, in, empire, furniture, made, in, paris, london, new, york, berlin, in, biedermeier, furniture, made, in, austria, in, karl, friedrich, schinkel, s, museums, in, berlin, sir, john, soane, s, bank, of, england, in, london, and, the, newly, built, united, states, capitol, in, washington, d, c, and, in,

these, had, begun, in, the, late, 1740s, but, only, achieved, a, wide, audience, in, the, 1760s, with, the, first, luxurious, volumes, of, tightly, controlled, distribution, of, le, antichit, di, ercolano, the, antiquities, of, herculaneum, the, antiquities, of, herculaneum, showed, that, even, the, most, classicizing, interiors, of, the, baroque, or, the, most, roman, rooms, of, william, kent, were, based, on, basilica, and, temple, exterior, architecture, turned, outside, in, hence, their, often, bombastic, appearance, to, modern, eyes, pedimented, window, frames, turned, into, gilded, mirrors, fireplaces, topped, with, temple, fronts, the, new, interiors, sought, to, recreate, an, authentically, roman, and, genuinely, interior, vocabulary, techniques, employed, in, the, style, included, flatter, lighter, motifs, sculpted, in, low, frieze, like, relief, or, painted, in, monotones, en, cama, eu, like, cameos, isolated, medallions, or, vases, or, busts, or, bucrania, or, other, motifs, suspended, on, swags, of, laurel, or, ribbon, with, slender, arabesques, against, backgrounds, perhaps, of, pompeiian, red, or, pale, tints, or, stone, colors, the, style, in, france, was, initially, a, parisian, style, the, go, t, grec, greek, style, not, a, court, style, when, louis, xvi, acceded, to, the, throne, in, 1774, marie, antoinette, his, fashion, loving, queen, brought, the, louis, xvi, style, to, court, however, there, was, no, real, attempt, to, employ, the, basic, forms, of, roman, furniture, until, around, the, turn, of, the, century, and, furniture, makers, were, more, likely, to, borrow, from, ancient, architecture, just, as, silversmiths, were, more, likely, to, take, from, ancient, pottery, and, stone, carving, than, metalwork, designers, and, craftsmen, seem, to, have, taken, an, almost, perverse, pleasure, in, transferring, motifs, from, one, medium, to, another, from, about, 1800, a, fresh, influx, of, greek, architectural, examples, seen, through, the, medium, of, etchings, and, engravings, gave, a, new, impetus, to, neoclassicism, the, greek, revival, at, the, same, time, the, empire, style, was, a, more, grandiose, wave, of, neoclassicism, in, architecture, and, the, decorative, arts, mainly, based, on, imperial, roman, styles, it, originated, in, and, took, its, name, from, the, rule, of, napoleon, in, the, first, french, empire, where, it, was, intended, to, idealize, napoleon, s, leadership, and, the, french, state, the, style, corresponds, to, the, more, bourgeois, biedermeier, style, in, the, german, speaking, lands, federal, style, in, the, united, states, the, regency, style, in, britain, and, the, napoleon, style, in, sweden, according, to, the, art, historian, hugh, honour, so, far, from, being, as, is, sometimes, supposed, the, culmination, of, the, neoclassical, movement, the, empire, marks, its, rapid, decline, and, transformation, back, once, more, into, a, mere, antique, revival, drained, of, all, the, high, minded, ideas, and, force, of, conviction, that, had, inspired, its, masterpieces, an, earlier, phase, of, the, style, was, called, the, adam, style, in, great, britain, neoclassicism, continued, to, be, a, major, force, in, academic, art, through, the, 19th, century, and, beyond, a, constant, antithesis, to, romanticism, or, gothic, revivals, although, from, the, late, 19th, century, on, it, had, often, been, considered, anti, modern, or, even, reactionary, in, influential, critical, circles, the, centres, of, several, european, cities, notably, saint, petersburg, and, munich, came, to, look, much, like, museums, of, neoclassical, architecture, gothic, revival, architecture, often, linked, with, the, romantic, cultural, movement, a, style, originating, in, the, 18th, century, which, grew, in, popularity, throughout, the, 19th, century, contrasted, neoclassicism, whilst, neoclassicism, was, characterized, by, greek, and, roman, influenced, styles, geometric, lines, and, order, gothic, revival, architecture, placed, an, emphasis, on, medieval, looking, buildings, often, made, to, have, a, rustic, romantic, appearance, it,

in, this, style, including, the, altes, museum, in, berlin, while, the, city, remained, dominated, by, baroque, city, planning, his, architecture, and, functional, style, provided, the, city, with, a, distinctly, neoclassical, center, his, bauakademie, is, considered, one, of, the, forerunners, of, modern, architecture, due, to, its, hithertofore, relatively, streamlined, fa, ade, of, the, building, from, the, second, half, of, the, 18th, century, through, the, 19th, century, italy, went, through, a, great, deal, of, socio, economic, changes, several, foreign, invasions, and, the, turbulent, risorgimento, which, resulted, in, italian, unification, in, 1861, thus, italian, art, went, through, a, series, of, minor, and, major, changes, in, style, italian, neoclassicism, was, the, earliest, manifestation, of, the, general, period, known, as, neoclassicism, and, lasted, more, than, the, other, national, variants, of, neoclassicism, it, developed, in, opposition, to, the, baroque, style, around, c, 1750, and, lasted, until, c, 1850, neoclassicism, began, around, the, period, of, the, rediscovery, of, pompeii, and, spread, all, over, europe, as, a, generation, of, art, students, returned, to, their, countries, from, the, grand, tour, in, italy, with, rediscovered, greco, roman, ideals, it, first, centred, in, rome, where, artists, such, as, antonio, canova, and, jacques, louis, david, were, active, in, the, second, half, of, the, 18th, century, before, moving, to, paris, painters, of, vedute, like, canaletto, and, giovanni, paolo, panini, also, enjoyed, a, huge, success, during, the, grand, tour, neoclassical, architecture, was, inspired, by, the, renaissance, works, of, andrea, palladio, and, saw, in, luigi, vanvitelli, the, main, interpreters, of, the, style, classicist, literature, had, a, great, impact, on, the, risorgimento, movement, the, main, figures, of, the, period, include, vittorio, alfieri, giuseppe, parini, vincenzo, monti, and, ugo, foscolo, giacomo, leopardi, and, alessandro, manzoni, nephew, of, cesare, beccaria, who, were, also, influenced, by, the, french, enlightenment, and, german, romanticism, the, virtuoso, violinist, paganini, and, the, operas, of, rossini, donnizetti, bellini, and, later, verdi, dominated, the, scene, in, italian, classical, and, romantic, music, the, art, of, francesco, hayez, and, especially, that, of, the, macchiaioli, represented, a, break, with, the, classical, school, which, came, to, an, end, as, italy, unified, see, italian, modern, and, contemporary, art, neoclassicism, was, the, last, italian, born, style, after, the, renaissance, and, baroque, to, spread, to, all, western, art, during, the, 19th, century, the, predominant, style, in, wallachia, and, moldavia, later, the, kingdom, of, romania, was, classicism, which, lasted, for, a, long, time, until, the, 20th, century, although, it, coexisted, in, some, short, periods, with, other, styles, foreign, architects, and, engineers, were, invited, here, since, the, first, decade, of, the, 19th, century, most, of, the, architects, that, built, during, the, beginning, of, the, century, were, foreigners, because, romanians, did, not, have, yet, the, instruction, needed, for, designing, buildings, that, were, very, different, compared, to, the, romanian, tradition, usually, using, classicism, they, started, building, together, with, romanian, artisans, usually, prepared, in, foreign, schools, or, academies, romanian, architects, studied, in, western, european, schools, as, well, one, example, is, alexandru, or, scu, one, of, the, representatives, of, neoclassicism, in, romania, classicism, manifested, both, in, religious, and, secular, architecture, a, good, example, of, secular, architecture, is, the, tirbei, palace, on, calea, victoriei, bucharest, built, around, the, year, 1835, after, the, plans, of, french, architect, michel, sanjouand, it, received, a, new, level, in, 1882, designed, by, austrian, architect, joseph, hartmann, in, 1905, 1914, russian, architecture, passed, through, a, brief, but, influential, period, of, neoclassical, revival, the, trend, began, with, recreation, of, empire, style, of, alexandrine, period, and, quickly, expanded, into, a, variety, of, neo, renaissance, palladian, and, modernized, yet, recognizably, classical, schools, they, were, led, by, architects, born, in, the, 1870s, who, reached, creative, peak, before, world, war, i, like, ivan, fomin, vladimir, shchuko, and, ivan, zholtovsky, when, the, economy, recovered, in, the, 1920s, these, architects, and, their, followers, continued, working, in, primarily, modernist, environment, some, zholtovsky, strictly, followed, the, classical, canon, others, fomin, schuko, ilya, golosov, developed, their, own, modernized, styles, with, the, crackdown, on, architect, s, independence, and, official, denial, of, modernism, 1932, demonstrated, by, the, international, contest, for, the, palace, of, soviets, neoclassicism, was, instantly, promoted, as, one, of, the, choices, in, stalinist, architecture, although, not, the, only, choice, it, coexisted, with, moderately, modernist, architecture, of, boris, iofan, bordering, with, contemporary, art, deco, schuko, again, the, purest, examples, of, the, style, were, produced, by, zholtovsky, school, that, remained, an, isolated, phenomena, the, political, intervention, was, a, disaster, for, constructivist, leaders, yet, was, sincerely, welcomed, by, architects, of, the, classical, schools, neoclassicism, was, an, easy, choice, for, the, soviet, union, since, it, did, not, rely, on, modern, construction, technologies, steel, frame, or, reinforced, concrete, and, could, be, reproduced, in, traditional, masonry, thus, the, designs, of, zholtovsky, fomin, and, other, old, masters, were, easily, replicated, in, remote, towns, under, strict, material, rationing, improvement, of, construction, technology, after, world, war, ii, permitted, stalinist, architects, to, venture, into, skyscraper, construction, although, stylistically, these, skyscrapers, including, exported, architecture, of, palace, of, culture, and, science, warsaw, and, the, shanghai, international, convention, centre, share, little, with, the, classical, models, neoclassicism, and, neo, renaissance, persisted, in, less, demanding, residential, and, office, projects, until, 1955, when, nikita, khrushchev, put, an, end, to, expensive, stalinist, architecture, the, adam, style, was, created, by, two, brothers, adam, and, james, who, published, in, 1777, a, volume, of, etchings, with, interior, ornamentation, in, the, interior, decoration, made, after, robert, adam, s, drawings, the, walls, ceilings, doors, and, any, other, surface, are, divided, into, big, panels, rectangular, round, square, with, stuccos, and, greco, roman, motifs, at, the, edges, ornaments, used, include, festoons, pearls, egg, and, dart, bands, medallions, and, any, other, motifs, used, during, the, classical, antiquity, especially, the, etruscan, ones, decorative, fittings, such, as, urn, shaped, stone, vases, gilded, silverware, lamps, and, stauettes, all, have, the, same, source, of, inspiration, classical, antiquity, the, adam, style, emphasizes, refined, rectangular, mirrors, framed, like, paintings, in, frames, with, stylised, leafs, or, with, a, pediment, above, them, supporting, an, urn, or, a, medallion, another, design, of, adam, mirrors, is, shaped, like, a, venetian, window, with, a, big, central, mirror, between, two, other, thinner, and, longer, ones, another, type, of, mirrors, are, the, oval, ones, usually, decorated, with, festoons, the, furniture, in, this, style, has, a, similar, structure, to, louis, xvi, furniture, besides, the, adam, style, when, it, comes, to, decorative, arts, england, is, also, known, for, the, ceramic, manufacturer, josiah, wedgwood, 1730, 1795, who, established, a, pottery, called, etruria, wedgwood, ware, is, made, of, a, material, called, jasperware, a, hard, and, fine, grained, type, of, stoneware, wedgwood, vases, are, usually, decorated, with, reliefs, in, two, colours, in, most, cases, the, figures, being, white, and, the, background, blue, on, the, american, continent, architecture, and, interior, decoration, have, been, highly, influenced, by, the, styles, developed, in, europe, the, french, taste, has, highly, marked, its, presence, in, the, southern, states, after, the, french, revolution, some, emigrants, have, moved, here, and, in, canada, a, big, part, of, the, population, has, french, origins, the, practical, spirit, and, the, material, situation, of, the, americans, at, that, time, gave, the, interiors, a, typic, atmosphere, all, the, american, furniture, carpets, tableware, ceramic, and, silverware, with, all, the, european, influences, and, sometimes, islamic, turkish, or, asian, were, made, in, conformity, with, the, american, norms, taste, and, functional, requirements, there, have, existed, in, the, us, a, period, of, the, queen, anne, style, and, an, chippendale, one, a, style, of, its, own, the, federal, style, has, developed, completely, in, the, 18th, and, early, 19th, centuries, which, has, flourished, being, influenced, by, britannic, taste, under, the, impulse, of, neoclassicism, architecture, interiors, and, furniture, have, been, created, the, style, although, it, has, numerous, characteristics, which, differ, from, state, to, state, is, unitary, the, structures, of, architecture, interiors, and, furniture, are, classicist, and, incorporate, baroque, and, rococo, influences, the, shapes, used, include, rectangles, ovals, and, crescents, stucco, or, wooden, panels, on, walls, and, ceilings, reproduce, classicist, motifs, furniture, tend, to, be, decorated, with, floral, marquetry, and, bronze, or, brass, inlays, sometimes, gilded, in, england, augustan, literature, had, a, direct, parallel, with, the, augustan, style, of, landscape, design, the, links, are, clearly, seen, in, the, work, of, alexander, pope, the, best, surviving, examples, of, neoclassical, english, gardens, are, chiswick, house, stowe, house, and, stourhead, in, fashion, neoclassicism, influenced, the, much, greater, simplicity, of, women, s, dresses, and, the, long, lasting, fashion, for, white, from, well, before, the, french, revolution, but, it, was, not, until, after, it, that, thorough, going, attempts, to, imitate, ancient, styles, became, fashionable, in, france, at, least, for, women, classical, costumes, had, long, been, worn, by, fashionable, ladies, posing, as, some, figure, from, greek, or, roman, myth, in, a, portrait, in, particular, there, was, a, rash, of, such, portraits, of, the, young, model, emma, lady, hamilton, from, the, 1780s, but, such, costumes, were, only, worn, for, the, portrait, sitting, and, masquerade, balls, until, the, revolutionary, period, and, perhaps, like, other, exotic, styles, as, undress, at, home, but, the, styles, worn, in, portraits, by, juliette, r, camier, jos, phine, de, beauharnais, th, r, sa, tallien, and, other, parisian, trend, setters, were, for, going, out, in, public, as, well, seeing, mme, tallien, at, the, opera, talleyrand, quipped, that, il, n, est, pas, possible, de, s, exposer, plus, somptueusement, one, could, not, be, more, sumptuously, undressed, in, 1788, just, before, the, revolution, the, court, portraitist, louise, lisabeth, vig, e, le, brun, had, held, a, greek, supper, where, the, ladies, wore, plain, white, grecian, tunics, shorter, classical, hairstyles, where, possible, with, curls, were, less, controversial, and, very, widely, adopted, and, hair, was, now, uncovered, even, outdoors, except, for, evening, dress, bonnets, or, other, coverings, had, typically, been, worn, even, indoors, before, thin, greek, style, ribbons, or, fillets, were, used, to, tie, or, decorate, the, hair, instead, very, light, and, loose, dresses, usually, white, and, often, with, shockingly, bare, arms, rose, sheer, from, the, ankle, to, just, below, the, bodice, where, there, was, a, strongly, emphasized, thin, hem, or, tie, round, the, body, often, in, a, different, colour, the, shape, is, now, often, known, as, the, empire, silhouette, although, it, predates, the, first, french, empire, of, napoleon, but, his, first, empress, jos, phine, de, beauharnais, was, influential, in, spreading, it, around, europe, a, long, rectangular, shawl, or, wrap, very, often, plain, red, but, with, a, decorated, border, in, portraits, helped, in, colder, weather, and, was, apparently, laid, around, the, midriff, when, seated, for, which, sprawling, semi, recumbent, postures, were, favoured, by, the, start, of, the, 19th, century, such, styles, had, spread, widely, across, europe, neoclassical, fashion, for, men, was, far, more, problematic, and, never, really, took, off, other, than, for, hair, where, it, played, an, important, role, in, the, shorter, styles, that, finally, despatched, the, use, of, wigs, and, then, white, hair, powder, for, younger, men, the, trouser, had, been, the, symbol, of, the, barbarian, to, the, greeks, and, romans, but, outside, the, painter, s, or, especially, the, sculptor, s, studio, few, men, were, prepared, to, abandon, it, indeed, the, period, saw, the, triumph, of, the, pure, trouser, or, pantaloon, over, the, culotte, or, knee, breeches, of, the, ancien, r, gime, even, when, david, designed, a, new, french, national, costume, at, the, request, of, the, government, during, the, height, of, the, revolutionary, enthusiasm, for, changing, everything, in, 1792, it, included, fairly, tight, leggings, under, a, coat, that, stopped, above, the, knee, a, high, proportion, of, well, to, do, young, men, spent, much, of, the, key, period, in, military, service, because, of, the, french, revolutionary, wars, and, military, uniform, which, began, to, emphasize, jackets, that, were, short, at, the, front, giving, a, full, view, of, tight, fitting, trousers, was, often, worn, when, not, on, duty, and, influenced, civilian, male, styles, the, trouser, problem, had, been, recognised, by, artists, as, a, barrier, to, creating, contemporary, history, paintings, like, other, elements, of, contemporary, dress, they, were, seen, as, irredeemably, ugly, and, unheroic, by, many, artists, and, critics, various, stratagems, were, used, to, avoid, depicting, them, in, modern, scenes, in, james, dawkins, and, robert, wood, discovering, the, ruins, of, palmyra, 1758, by, gavin, hamilton, the, two, gentleman, antiquaries, are, shown, in, toga, like, arab, robes, in, watson, and, the, shark, 1778, by, john, singleton, copley, the, main, figure, could, plausibly, be, shown, nude, and, the, composition, is, such, that, of, the, eight, other, men, shown, only, one, shows, a, single, breeched, leg, prominently, however, the, americans, copley, and, benjamin, west, led, the, artists, who, successfully, showed, that, trousers, could, be, used, in, heroic, scenes, with, works, like, west, s, the, death, of, general, wolfe, 1770, and, copley, s, the, death, of, major, peirson, 6, january, 1781, 1783, although, the, trouser, was, still, being, carefully, avoided, in, the, raft, of, the, medusa, completed, in, 1819, classically, inspired, male, hairstyles, included, the, bedford, crop, arguably, the, precursor, of, most, plain, modern, male, styles, which, was, invented, by, the, radical, politician, francis, russell, 5th, duke, of, bedford, as, a, protest, against, a, tax, on, hair, powder, he, encouraged, his, friends, to, adopt, it, by, betting, them, they, would, not, another, influential, style, or, group, of, styles, was, named, by, the, french, coiffure, la, titus, after, titus, junius, brutus, not, in, fact, the, roman, emperor, titus, as, often, assumed, with, hair, short, and, layered, but, somewhat, piled, up, on, the, crown, often, with, restrained, quiffs, or, locks, hanging, down, variants, are, familiar, from, the, hair, of, both, napoleon, and, george, iv, of, the, united, kingdom, the, style, was, supposed, to, have, been, introduced, by, the, actor, fran, ois, joseph, talma, who, upstaged, his, wigged, co, actors, when, appearing, in, productions, of, works, such, as, voltaire, s, brutus, about, lucius, junius, brutus, who, orders, the, execution, of, his, son, titus, in, 1799, a, parisian, fashion, magazine, reported, that, even, bald, men, were, adopting, titus, wigs, and, the, style, was, also, worn, by, women, the, journal, de, paris, reporting, in, 1802, that, more, than, half, of, elegant, women, were, wearing, their, hair, or, wig, la, titus, neoclassicism, in, music, is, a, 20th, century, movement, in, this, case, it, is, the, classical, and, baroque, musical, styles, of, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, with, their, fondness, for, greek, and, roman, themes, that, were, being, revived, not, the, music, of, the, ancient, world, itself, the, early, 20th, century, had, not, yet, distinguished, the, baroque, period, in, music, on, which, neoclassical, composers, mainly, drew, from, what, we, now, call, the, classical, period, the, movement, was, a, reaction, in, the, first, part, of, the, 20th, century, to, the, disintegrating, chromaticism, of, late, romanticism, and, impressionism, emerging, in, parallel, with, musical, modernism, which, sought, to, abandon, key, tonality, altogether, it, manifested, a, desire, for, cleanness, and, simplicity, of, style, which, allowed, for, quite, dissonant, paraphrasing, of, classical, procedures, but, sought, to, blow, away, the, cobwebs, of, romanticism, and, the, twilit, glimmerings, of, impressionism, in, favour, of, bold, rhythms, assertive, harmony, and, clean, cut, sectional, forms, coinciding, with, the, vogue, for, reconstructed, classical, dancing, and, costume, in, ballet, and, physical, education, the, 17th, 18th, century, dance, suite, had, had, a, minor, revival, before, world, war, i, but, the, neoclassicists, were, not, altogether, happy, with, unmodified, diatonicism, and, tended, to, emphasise, the, bright, dissonance, of, suspensions, and, ornaments, the, angular, qualities, of, 17th, century, modal, harmony, and, the, energetic, lines, of, countrapuntal, part, writing, ottorino, respighi, s, ancient, airs, and, dances, 1917, led, the, way, for, the, sort, of, sound, to, which, the, neoclassicists, aspired, although, the, practice, of, borrowing, musical, styles, from, the, past, has, not, been, uncommon, throughout, musical, history, art, musics, have, gone, through, periods, where, musicians, used, modern, techniques, coupled, with, older, forms, or, harmonies, to, create, new, kinds, of, works, notable, compositional, characteristics, are, referencing, diatonic, tonality, conventional, forms, dance, suites, concerti, grossi, sonata, forms, etc, the, idea, of, absolute, music, untramelled, by, descriptive, or, emotive, associations, the, use, of, light, musical, textures, and, a, conciseness, of, musical, expression, in, classical, music, this, was, most, notably, perceived, between, the, 1920s, and, the, 1950s, igor, stravinsky, is, the, best, known, composer, using, this, style, he, effectively, began, the, musical, revolution, with, his, bach, like, octet, for, wind, instruments, 1923, a, particular, individual, work, that, represents, this, style, well, is, prokofiev, s, classical, symphony, no, 1, in, d, which, is, reminiscent, of, the, symphonic, style, of, haydn, or, mozart, neoclassical, ballet, as, innovated, by, george, balanchine, de, cluttered, the, russian, imperial, style, in, terms, of, costume, steps, and, narrative, while, also, introducing, technical, innovations, after, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, neoclassicism, starts, to, no, longer, be, the, main, style, being, replaced, by, eclecticism, of, classical, styles, the, palais, garnier, in, paris, is, a, good, example, of, this, since, despite, being, predominantly, neoclassical, it, features, elements, and, ornaments, taken, from, baroque, and, renaissance, architecture, this, practice, was, frequent, in, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, architecture, before, world, war, i, besides, neoclassicism, the, beaux, arts, de, paris, well, known, for, this, eclecticism, of, classical, styles, pablo, picasso, experimented, with, classicizing, motifs, in, the, years, immediately, following, world, war, i, in, american, architecture, neoclassicism, was, one, expression, of, the, american, renaissance, movement, ca, 1890, 1917, its, last, manifestation, was, in, beaux, arts, architecture, and, its, final, large, public, projects, were, the, lincoln, memorial, highly, criticized, at, the, time, the, national, gallery, of, art, in, washington, d, c, also, heavily, criticized, by, the, architectural, community, as, being, backward, thinking, and, old, fashioned, in, its, design, and, the, american, museum, of, natural, history, s, roosevelt, memorial, these, were, considered, stylistic, anachronisms, when, they, were, finished, in, the, british, raj, sir, edwin, lutyens, monumental, city, planning, for, new, delhi, marks, the, sunset, of, neoclassicism, world, war, ii, was, to, shatter, most, longing, for, and, imitation, of, a, mythical, time, there, was, an, entire, 20th, century, movement, in, the, non, visual, arts, which, was, also, called, neoclassicism, it, encompassed, at, least, music, philosophy, and, literature, it, was, between, the, end, of, world, war, i, and, the, end, of, world, war, ii, for, information, on, the, musical, aspects, see, 20th, century, classical, music, and, neoclassicism, in, music, for, information, on, the, philosophical, aspects, see, great, books, this, literary, neoclassical, movement, rejected, the, extreme, romanticism, of, for, example, dada, in, favour, of, restraint, religion, specifically, christianity, and, a, reactionary, political, program, although, the, foundations, for, this, movement, in, english, literature, were, laid, by, t, e, hulme, the, most, famous, neoclassicists, were, t, s, eliot, and, wyndham, lewis, in, russia, the, movement, crystallized, as, early, as, 1910, under, the, name, of, acmeism, with, anna, akhmatova, and, osip, mandelshtam, as, the, leading, representatives, although, it, started, to, be, seen, as, dated, after, ww1, principles, proportions, and, other, neoclassical, elements, were, not, abandoned, yet, art, deco, was, the, dominant, style, during, the, interwar, period, and, it, corresponds, with, the, taste, of, a, bourgeois, elite, for, high, class, french, styles, of, the, past, including, the, louis, xvi, directoire, and, empire, the, period, styles, of, french, neoclassicism, at, the, same, time, the, french, elite, was, equally, capable, of, appreciating, modern, art, like, the, works, of, pablo, picasso, or, amedeo, modigliani, the, result, of, this, situation, is, the, early, art, deco, style, which, uses, both, new, and, old, elements, the, palais, de, tokyo, from, 1937, in, paris, by, andr, aubert, and, marcel, dastugue, is, a, good, example, of, this, although, ornaments, are, not, used, here, the, facade, being, decorated, only, with, reliefs, the, way, columns, are, present, here, is, a, strong, reminiscence, of, neoclassicism, art, deco, design, often, drew, on, neoclassical, motifs, without, expressing, them, overtly, severe, blocky, commodes, by, mile, jacques, ruhlmann, or, louis, s, e, andr, mare, crisp, extremely, low, relief, friezes, of, damsels, and, gazelles, in, every, medium, fashionable, dresses, that, were, draped, or, cut, on, the, bias, to, recreate, grecian, lines, the, art, dance, of, isadora, duncan, conservative, modernist, architects, such, as, auguste, perret, in, france, kept, the, rhythms, and, spacing, of, columnar, architecture, even, in, factory, buildings, the, oscillation, of, art, deco, between, the, use, of, historic, elements, shapes, and, proportions, and, the, appetite, for, new, for, modernism, is, the, result, of, multiple, factors, one, of, them, is, eclecticism, the, complexity, and, heterogeneity, of, art, deco, is, largely, due, to, the, eclectic, spirit, stylized, elements, from, repertoire, of, beaux, arts, neoclassicism, or, of, cultures, distant, in, time, and, space, ancient, egypt, pre, columbian, americas, or, sub, saharian, african, art, are, put, together, with, references, to, modernist, avant, guard, artists, of, the, early, 20th, century, henri, matisse, amedeo, modigliani, or, constantin, br, ncu, i, the, art, deco, phenomenon, owes, to, academic, eclecticism, and, neoclassicism, mainly, the, existence, of, a, specific, architecture, without, the, contribution, of, the, beaux, arts, trained, architects, art, deco, architecture, would, have, remained, with, the, exception, of, residential, buildings, a, collection, of, decorative, objects, magnified, to, an, urban, scale, like, the, pavilions, of, the, international, exhibition, of, modern, decorative, and, industrial, arts, from, 1925, controversial, at, their, time, another, reason, for, the, swinging, between, historical, elements, and, modernism, was, consumer, culture, objects, and, buildings, in, the, puritan, international, style, devoid, of, any, ornamentation, or, citation, of, the, past, were, too, radical, for, the, general, public, in, interwar, france, and, england, the, spirit, of, the, public, and, much, architectural, criticism, could, not, conceive, a, style, totally, deprived, of, ornament, like, the, international, style, the, use, of, historic, styles, as, sources, of, inspiration, for, art, deco, starts, as, far, back, as, the, years, before, ww1, through, the, efforts, of, decorators, like, maurice, dufr, ne, paul, follot, paul, iribe, andr, groult, l, on, jallot, or, mile, jacques, ruhlmann, who, relate, to, the, prestigious, french, artistic, and, handicraft, tradition, of, the, late, 18th, and, early, 19th, centuries, the, louis, xvi, directoire, and, louis, philippe, and, who, want, to, bring, a, new, approach, to, these, styles, the, neo, louis, xvi, style, was, really, popular, in, france, and, romania, in, the, years, before, ww1, around, 1910, and, it, heavily, influenced, multiple, early, art, deco, designs, and, buildings, a, good, example, of, this, is, the, ch, teau, de, sept, saulx, in, grand, est, france, by, louis, s, e, 1928, 1929, in, fascist, italy, nazi, germany, romania, under, the, rule, of, carol, ii, and, the, soviet, union, during, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, totalitarian, regimes, chose, neoclassicism, for, state, buildings, and, art, architecture, was, central, to, totalitarian, regimes, expression, of, their, permanence, despite, their, obvious, novelty, the, way, totalitarian, regimes, drew, from, classicism, took, many, forms, when, it, comes, to, state, buildings, in, italy, and, romania, architects, attempted, to, fuse, a, modern, sensibility, with, abstract, classical, forms, two, good, examples, of, this, are, the, palazzo, della, civilt, italiana, in, rome, and, the, university, rectorate, and, law, faculty, building, in, bucharest, bulevardul, mihail, kog, lniceanu, no, 36, 46, in, contrast, the, classicism, of, the, soviet, union, known, as, socialist, realism, was, bombastic, overloaded, with, ornaments, and, architectural, sculptures, as, an, attempt, to, be, in, contrast, with, the, simplicity, of, capitalist, or, bourgeois, styles, like, art, deco, or, modernism, the, lomonosov, university, in, moscow, is, a, good, example, of, this, nikita, khrushchev, the, soviet, leader, that, succeeded, stalin, did, not, like, this, pompous, socialist, realist, architecture, from, the, reign, of, his, predecessor, because, of, the, low, speed, and, cost, of, these, neoclassical, buildings, he, stated, that, they, spent, people, s, money, on, beauty, that, no, one, needs, instead, of, building, simpler, but, more, in, the, soviet, union, neoclassicism, was, embraced, as, a, rejection, of, art, deco, and, modernism, which, the, communists, saw, as, being, too, bourgeois, and, capitalist, this, communist, neoclassical, style, is, known, as, socialist, realism, and, it, was, popular, during, the, reign, of, joseph, stalin, 1924, 1953, in, fine, art, generally, it, manifested, through, deeply, idealized, representations, of, wiry, workers, shown, as, heroes, in, collective, farms, or, industrialized, cities, political, assemblies, achievements, of, soviet, technology, and, through, depictions, happy, children, staying, around, lenin, or, stalin, both, subject, matter, and, representation, were, carefully, monitored, artistic, merit, was, determined, by, the, degree, to, which, a, work, contributed, to, the, building, of, socialism, all, artists, had, to, join, the, state, controlled, union, of, soviet, artists, and, produce, work, in, the, accepted, style, the, three, guiding, principles, of, socialist, realism, were, party, loyalty, presentation, of, correct, ideology, and, accessibility, realism, more, easily, understood, by, the, masses, was, the, style, of, choice, at, the, beginning, in, the, soviet, union, multiple, competing, avant, garde, movements, were, present, notably, constructivism, however, as, stalin, consolidated, his, power, towards, the, end, of, the, 1920s, avant, garde, art, and, architecture, were, suppressed, and, eventually, outlawed, and, official, state, styles, were, established, after, boris, iofan, won, the, competition, for, the, design, of, the, palace, of, the, soviets, with, a, stepped, classical, tower, surmounted, by, a, giant, statue, of, lenin, architecture, soon, reverted, to, pre, revolutionary, styles, of, art, and, architecture, untainted, by, constructivism, s, perceived, western, influence, although, socialist, realism, in, architecture, ended, more, or, less, with, the, death, of, stalin, and, the, rise, of, nikita, khrushchev, paintings, in, this, style, continued, to, be, produced, especially, in, countries, where, there, was, a, strong, personality, cult, of, the, leader, in, power, like, in, the, case, of, mao, zedong, s, china, kim, il, sung, s, north, korea, or, nicolae, ceau, escu, s, romania, the, nazis, suppressed, germany, s, vibrant, avant, garde, culture, once, they, gained, control, of, the, government, in, 1933, albert, speer, was, set, as, adolf, hitler, s, architectural, advisor, in, 1934, and, he, tried, to, create, an, architecture, that, would, both, reflect, the, perceived, unity, of, the, german, people, and, act, as, backdrop, to, the, nazis, expressions, of, power, the, nazis, approach, to, architecture, was, riffled, with, contradictions, while, hitler, and, speer, s, plans, for, reordering, berlin, aspired, to, imitate, imperial, rome, in, rural, contexts, nazi, buildings, took, inspiration, from, local, vernaculars, trying, to, channel, an, authentic, german, spirit, when, it, come, to, fine, art, the, nazis, created, the, term, degenerate, art, for, modern, art, a, kind, of, art, which, to, them, was, un, german, jewish, or, communist, the, nazis, hated, modern, art, and, linked, it, to, cultural, bolshevism, the, conspiracy, theory, that, art, or, culture, broadly, was, controlled, by, a, leftist, jewish, cabal, seeking, to, destroy, the, aryan, race, hitler, s, war, on, modern, art, mostly, consisted, of, an, exhibition, that, tried, to, discredit, modern, artists, called, the, degenerate, art, exhibition, german, die, ausstellung, entartete, kunst, this, exhibition, was, displayed, next, to, the, great, exhibition, of, german, art, which, consisted, of, artworks, that, the, nazis, approved, of, this, way, the, visitiors, of, both, exhibitions, could, compare, the, art, labeled, by, the, regime, as, good, and, bad, with, a, similar, atitude, the, regime, closed, in, 1931, the, bauhaus, an, avant, garde, art, school, in, dessau, that, was, extremely, influential, post, war, it, reopened, in, berlin, in, 1932, but, was, closed, again, in, 1933, compared, to, germany, and, the, soviet, union, in, italy, the, avant, garde, contributed, to, state, architecture, classical, architecture, was, also, an, influence, echoing, benito, mussolini, s, far, cruder, attempts, to, create, links, between, his, fascist, regime, and, ancient, rome, some, italian, architects, tried, to, create, fusions, between, modernism, and, classicism, like, marcello, piacentini, with, the, sapienza, university, of, rome, or, giuseppe, terragni, with, casa, del, fascio, in, como, in, romania, towards, the, late, 1930s, influenced, by, the, autocratic, tendency, of, king, carol, ii, multiple, state, buildings, were, erected, they, were, neoclassical, many, very, similar, with, what, was, popular, in, the, same, years, in, fascist, italy, examples, in, bucharest, include, the, university, rectorate, and, law, faculty, building, bulevardul, mihail, kog, lniceanu, no, 36, 46, the, kretzulescu, apartment, building, calea, victoriei, no, 45, the, cfr, building, bulevardul, dinicu, golescu, no, 38, or, the, victoria, palace, pia, a, victoriei, no, 1, the, royal, palace, whose, interiors, are, mostly, done, in, a, neo, adam, style, stands, out, by, being, more, decorated, a, little, closer, to, the, architecture, before, world, war, i, an, early, text, questioning, modernism, was, by, architect, robert, venturi, complexity, and, contradiction, in, architecture, 1966, in, which, he, recommended, a, revival, of, the, presence, of, the, past, in, architectural, design, he, tried, to, include, in, his, own, buildings, qualities, that, he, described, as, inclusion, inconsistency, compromise, accommodation, adaptation, superadjacency, equivalence, multiple, focus, juxtaposition, or, good, and, bad, space, robert, venturi, s, work, reflected, the, broader, counter, cultural, mood, of, the, 1960s, which, saw, younger, generations, begin, to, question, and, challenge, the, political, social, and, racial, realities, with, which, they, found, themselves, confronted, this, rejection, of, modernism, is, known, as, postmodernism, robert, venturi, parodies, ludwig, mies, van, der, rohe, s, well, known, maxim, less, is, more, with, less, is, a, bore, during, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, some, postmodern, architects, found, a, refuge, in, a, sort, of, neo, neoclassicism, their, use, of, classicism, was, not, limited, only, to, ornaments, using, more, or, less, proportions, and, other, principles, too, post, modern, classicism, had, been, variously, described, by, some, people, as, camp, or, kitsch, an, architect, who, has, been, remarked, through, post, modern, classicism, is, ricardo, bofill, his, work, includes, two, housing, projects, of, titanic, scale, near, paris, known, as, les, arcades, du, lac, from, 1975, to, 1981, and, les, espaces, d, abraxas, from, 1978, to, 1983, a, building, that, stands, out, through, its, revivalism, is, the, j, paul, getty, museum, in, malibu, california, from, 1970, to, 1975, inspired, by, the, ancient, roman, villa, of, the, papyri, at, herculaneum, the, j, paul, getty, museum, is, far, closer, to, 19th, century, neoclassicism, like, the, pompejanum, in, aschaffenburg, germany, than, to, post, modern, classicism, of, the, 1980s, after, a, lull, during, the, period, of, modern, architectural, dominance, roughly, post, world, war, ii, until, the, mid, 1980s, neoclassicism, has, seen, something, of, a, resurgence, as, of, the, first, decade, of, the, 21st, century, contemporary, neoclassical, architecture, is, usually, classed, under, the, umbrella, term, of, new, classical, architecture, sometimes, it, is, also, referred, to, as, neo, historicism, or, traditionalism, also, a, number, of, pieces, of, postmodern, architecture, draw, inspiration, from, and, include, explicit, references, to, neoclassicism, antigone, district, and, the, national, theatre, of, catalonia, in, barcelona, among, them, postmodern, architecture, occasionally, includes, historical, elements, like, columns, capitals, or, the,
