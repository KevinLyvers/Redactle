of, which, have, not, survived, its, plot, centers, on, the, actions, of, medea, a, former, princess, of, the, kingdom, of, colchis, and, the, wife, of, jason, she, finds, her, position, in, the, world, threatened, as, jason, leaves, her, for, a, princess, of, corinth, and, takes, vengeance, on, him, by, murdering, his, new, wife, and, her, own, two, sons, before, escaping, to, athens, to, start, a, new, life, euripides, play, has, been, explored, and, interpreted, by, playwrights, across, the, centuries, and, the, world, in, a, variety, of, ways, offering, political, psychoanalytical, feminist, among, many, other, original, readings, of, medea, jason, and, the, core, themes, of, the, play, medea, along, with, three, other, plays, earned, euripides, third, prize, in, the, city, dionysia, some, believe, that, this, indicates, a, poor, reception, but, the, competition, that, year, was, extraordinarily, keen, sophocles, often, winning, first, prize, came, second, the, play, was, initially, rediscovered, with, rome, s, augustan, drama, and, then, again, in, the, 16th, century, it, has, remained, part, of, the, tragedic, repertoire, becoming, a, classic, of, the, western, canon, and, the, most, frequently, performed, greek, tragedy, in, the, 20th, century, it, experienced, renewed, interest, in, the, feminist, movement, of, the, late, 20th, century, being, interpreted, as, a, nuanced, and, sympathetic, portrayal, of, medea, s, struggle, to, take, charge, of, her, own, life, in, a, male, dominated, world, the, play, holds, the, american, theatre, wing, s, tony, award, record, for, most, wins, for, the, same, female, lead, character, with, judith, anderson, winning, in, 1948, zoe, caldwell, in, 1982, and, diana, rigg, in, 1994, medea, was, first, performed, in, 431, bc, at, the, city, dionysia, festival, here, every, year, three, tragedians, competed, against, each, other, each, writing, a, tetralogy, of, three, tragedies, and, a, satyr, play, alongside, medea, were, philoctetes, dictys, and, the, satyr, play, theristai, in, 431, the, competition, was, among, euphorion, the, son, of, famed, playwright, aeschylus, sophocles, euripides, main, rival, and, euripides, euphorion, won, and, euripides, placed, third, and, last, medea, has, survived, the, transplants, of, culture, and, time, and, continues, to, captivate, audiences, with, its, riveting, power, tessitore, the, play, s, influence, can, be, seen, in, the, works, of, later, playwrights, such, as, william, shakespeare, while, medea, is, considered, one, of, the, great, plays, of, the, western, canon, euripides, place, in, the, competition, suggests, that, his, first, audience, might, not, have, responded, so, favorably, a, scholium, to, line, 264, of, the, play, suggests, that, medea, s, children, were, traditionally, killed, by, the, corinthians, after, her, escape, so, euripides, apparent, invention, of, the, filicide, might, have, offended, as, his, first, treatment, of, the, hippolytus, myth, did, that, euripides, and, others, took, liberties, with, medea, s, story, may, be, inferred, from, the, 1st, century, bc, historian, diodorus, siculus, speaking, generally, it, is, because, of, the, desire, of, the, tragic, poets, for, the, marvellous, that, so, varied, and, inconsistent, an, account, of, medea, has, been, given, out, a, common, urban, legend, claimed, that, euripides, put, the, blame, on, medea, because, the, corinthians, had, bribed, him, with, a, sum, of, five, talents, in, the, 4th, century, bc, south, italian, vase, painting, offers, a, number, of, medea, representations, that, are, connected, to, euripides, play, the, most, famous, is, a, krater, in, munich, however, these, representations, always, differ, considerably, from, the, plots, of, the, play, or, are, too, general, to, support, any, direct, link, to, euripides, play, but, the, violent, and, powerful, character, of, medea, and, her, double, nature, both, loving, and, destructive, became, a, standard, for, later, periods, of, antiquity, medea, has, been, adapted, into, numerous, forms, of, media, including, operas, films, and, novels, with, the, text, s, rediscovery, in, 1st, century, rome, the, play, was, adapted, by, the, tragedians, ennius, lucius, accius, ovid, seneca, the, younger, and, hosidius, geta, among, others, again, in, 16th, century, europe, and, with, the, development, of, modern, literary, criticism, medea, has, provoked, multifarious, reactions, the, form, of, the, play, differs, from, many, other, greek, tragedies, by, its, simplicity, most, scenes, involve, only, medea, one, other, character, and, the, chorus, representing, the, women, of, corinth, these, simple, encounters, highlight, medea, s, skill, and, determination, in, manipulating, powerful, male, figures, the, play, is, also, the, only, greek, tragedy, in, which, a, kin, killer, makes, it, unpunished, to, the, end, of, the, play, and, the, only, tragedy, about, child, killing, in, which, the, deed, is, performed, in, cold, blood, as, opposed, to, in, a, state, of, temporary, madness, medea, s, rebellion, shakes, the, world, as, she, tells, of, her, past, history, shedding, light, on, the, actions, that, ultimately, lead, to, her, denigration, and, dethronement, euripides, depicts, medea, as, a, witch, and, a, devourer, of, men, and, children, rather, than, as, a, wife, and, mother, wronged, euripides, characterization, of, medea, exhibits, the, inner, emotions, of, passion, love, and, vengeance, according, to, classics, scholar, fiona, macintosh, has, successfully, negotiated, her, path, through, very, diverse, cultural, and, political, contexts, either, by, being, radically, recast, as, exemplary, mother, and, wife, or, by, being, seen, as, a, proto, feminist, wrongly, abandoned, by, a, treacherous, husband, feminist, readings, have, interpreted, the, play, as, either, a, sympathetic, exploration, of, the, disadvantages, of, being, a, woman, in, a, patriarchal, society, or, as, an, expression, of, misogynist, attitudes, in, conflict, with, this, sympathetic, undertone, or, reinforcing, a, more, negative, reading, is, medea, s, barbarian, identity, which, some, argue, might, antagonize, a, 5th, century, bc, greek, audience, it, can, be, argued, that, in, the, play, euripides, portrays, medea, as, an, enraged, woman, who, kills, her, children, to, get, revenge, on, her, husband, jason, because, of, his, betrayal, of, their, marriage, medea, is, often, cited, as, an, example, of, the, madwoman, in, the, attic, trope, in, which, women, who, defy, societal, norms, are, portrayed, as, mentally, unstable, a, competing, interpretation, is, that, medea, kills, her, children, because, she, cares, for, them, and, worries, about, their, well, being, once, she, commits, to, her, plan, to, kill, creon, and, jason, s, new, bride, she, knows, her, children, are, in, danger, of, being, murdered, this, is, not, a, paranoid, fantasy, at, this, time, in, myth, and, history, helping, one, s, friends, and, hurting, one, s, enemies, was, considered, a, virtue, thus, by, their, code, of, ethics, the, corinthians, would, do, right, to, avenge, their, king, and, princess, in, another, version, of, the, myth, the, people, of, corinth, kill, her, children, to, avenge, the, deaths, of, creon, and, his, daughter, glauke, conversely, a, focus, on, medea, s, rage, leads, to, the, interpretation, that, medea, becomes, the, personification, of, vengeance, with, her, humanity, mortified, and, sloughed, off, cowherd, 129, medea, s, heritage, places, her, in, a, position, more, typically, reserved, for, males, hers, is, the, power, of, the, sun, appropriately, symbolized, by, her, great, radiance, tremendous, heat, and, boundless, passion, in, this, view, medea, is, inhuman, and, her, suffering, is, self, inflicted, just, as, jason, argues, in, his, debate, with, her, and, yet, if, we, see, events, through, medea, s, eyes, we, view, a, wife, intent, on, vengeance, and, a, mother, concerned, about, her, children, s, safety, and, quality, of, life, thus, medea, as, a, wife, kills, creon, and, glauke, in, the, act, of, vengeance, and, medea, as, a, mother, thinks, her, children, will, be, better, off, killed, by, her, hand, than, left, to, suffer, at, the, hands, of, an, enemy, intent, on, vengeance, medea, is, often, described, as, having, a, heroic, temper, and, a, strong, motivation, to, avoid, the, laughter, of, her, enemies, even, at, the, cost, of, decisions, that, contradict, self, interest, personal, safety, or, strongly, held, moral, beliefs, lush, 2014, although, some, may, say, that, her, motive, was, jealousy, over, jason, s, new, bride, her, pride, also, made, her, unwilling, to, let, her, enemies, in, this, case, jason, and, his, new, wife, look, down, on, her, medea, stated, that, her, enemies, cause, her, pain, and, rejoice, and, that, her, priority, was, to, avoid, her, enemies, derision, lush, 2014, although, the, murder, of, her, children, would, cause, her, pain, medea, s, temperament, caused, her, to, prioritize, jason, s, unhappiness, over, anything, else, medea, is, centered, on, medea, s, calculated, desire, for, revenge, against, her, unfaithful, husband, medea, is, of, divine, descent, and, had, the, gift, of, prophecy, she, married, jason, and, used, her, magic, powers, and, advice, to, help, him, find, and, retrieve, the, golden, fleece, the, play, is, set, in, corinth, some, time, after, jason, s, quest, for, the, golden, fleece, where, he, met, medea, the, play, begins, with, medea, in, a, blind, rage, towards, jason, for, arranging, to, marry, glauce, the, daughter, of, king, creon, the, nurse, overhearing, medea, s, grief, fears, what, she, might, do, to, herself, or, her, children, creon, in, anticipation, of, medea, s, wrath, arrives, and, reveals, his, plans, to, send, her, into, exile, medea, pleads, for, one, day, s, delay, and, eventually, creon, acquiesces, in, order, to, be, accepted, medea, must, become, trickier, and, must, totally, conceal, her, position, crouching, at, creon, s, feet, she, begs, him, in, the, name, of, her, children, to, allow, her, only, one, day, at, this, creon, is, moved, and, grants, to, her, one, more, day, in, corinth, medea, s, unexpected, power, of, persuasion, or, even, of, fascination, lies, in, her, change, of, attitude, instead, of, preaching, to, creon, about, the, unpopularity, of, the, sophoi, she, plays, the, role, of, a, desperate, mother, needing, one, day, to, prepare, for, exile, medea, is, aware, of, the, humiliating, quality, of, this, tactic, but, she, justifies, it, on, the, grounds, of, a, gain, and, of, her, need, to, remain, in, corinth, do, you, think, that, i, would, ever, have, flattered, that, man, unless, i, had, some, gain, to, make, or, some, device, to, execute, i, wouldn, t, have, even, spoken, or, touched, him, with, my, hands, in, the, next, scene, jason, arrives, to, explain, his, rationale, for, his, apparent, betrayal, he, explains, that, he, could, not, pass, up, the, opportunity, to, marry, a, royal, princess, as, medea, is, only, a, barbarian, woman, but, hopes, to, someday, join, the, two, families, and, keep, medea, as, his, mistress, medea, and, the, chorus, of, corinthian, women, do, not, believe, him, she, reminds, him, that, she, left, her, own, people, for, him, i, rescued, you, i, betrayed, both, my, father, and, my, house, now, where, should, i, go, and, that, she, saved, him, and, slew, the,

it, with, a, lavish, hand, but, medea, spurns, him, go, on, play, the, bridegroom, perhaps, you, ve, made, a, match, you, ll, one, day, have, cause, to, lament, in, the, following, scene, medea, encounters, aegeus, king, of, athens, he, reveals, to, her, that, despite, his, marriage, he, is, still, without, children, he, visited, the, oracle, who, merely, told, him, that, he, was, instructed, not, to, unstop, the, wineskin, s, neck, medea, relays, her, current, situation, to, him, and, begs, for, aegeus, to, let, her, stay, in, athens, if, she, gives, him, drugs, to, end, his, infertility, aegeus, unaware, of, medea, s, plans, for, revenge, agrees, medea, then, returns, to, plotting, the, murders, of, glauce, and, creon, she, decides, to, poison, some, golden, robes, a, family, heirloom, and, gift, from, the, sun, god, helios, her, grandfather, and, a, coronet, in, hopes, that, the, bride, will, not, be, able, to, resist, wearing, them, and, consequently, be, poisoned, medea, resolves, to, kill, her, own, children, as, well, not, because, the, children, have, done, anything, wrong, but, because, she, feels, it, is, the, best, way, to, hurt, jason, she, calls, for, jason, once, more, and, in, an, elaborate, ruse, apologizes, to, him, for, overreacting, to, his, decision, to, marry, glauce, when, jason, appears, fully, convinced, that, she, regrets, her, actions, medea, begins, to, cry, in, mourning, of, the, exile, she, convinces, jason, to, allow, their, two, sons, to, give, gifts, to, glauce, in, hopes, that, creon, will, lift, the, exile, against, the, children, eventually, jason, agrees, forgive, what, i, said, in, anger, i, will, yield, to, the, decree, and, only, beg, one, favor, that, my, children, may, stay, they, shall, take, to, the, princess, a, costly, robe, and, a, golden, crown, and, pray, for, her, protection, in, the, next, scene, a, messenger, recounts, glauce, and, creon, s, deaths, when, the, children, arrived, with, the, robes, and, coronet, glauce, gleefully, put, them, on, and, went, to, find, her, father, the, poison, overtook, her, and, she, fell, to, the, floor, dying, horribly, and, painfully, creon, clutched, her, tightly, as, he, tried, to, save, her, and, by, coming, in, contact, with, the, robes, and, coronet, was, poisoned, and, died, as, well, alas, the, bride, had, died, in, horrible, agony, for, no, sooner, had, she, put, on, medea, s, gifts, than, a, devouring, poison, consumed, her, limbs, as, with, fire, and, in, his, endeavor, to, save, his, daughter, the, old, father, died, too, while, medea, is, pleased, with, her, current, success, she, decides, to, take, it, one, step, further, since, jason, brought, shame, upon, her, for, trying, to, start, a, new, family, medea, resolves, to, destroy, the, family, he, was, willing, to, give, up, by, killing, their, sons, medea, does, have, a, moment, of, hesitation, when, she, considers, the, pain, that, her, children, s, deaths, will, put, her, through, however, she, steels, her, resolve, to, cause, jason, the, most, pain, possible, and, rushes, offstage, with, a, knife, to, kill, her, children, determined, to, stop, medea, the, chorus, runs, after, her, only, to, hear, the, children, scream, jason, then, rushes, onto, the, scene, to, confront, medea, about, murdering, creon, and, glauce, and, he, quickly, discovers, that, his, children, have, been, killed, as, well, medea, then, appears, above, the, stage, with, the, bodies, of, her, children, in, a, chariot, given, to, her, by, the, sun, god, helios, when, this, play, was, put, on, this, scene, was, accomplished, using, the, mechane, device, usually, reserved, for, the, appearance, of, a, god, or, goddess, she, confronts, jason, reveling, in, his, pain, at, being, unable, to, ever, hold, his, children, again, i, do, not, leave, my, children, s, bodies, with, thee, i, take, them, with, me, that, i, may, bury, them, in, hera, s, precinct, and, for, thee, who, didst, me, all, that, evil, i, prophesy, an, evil, doom, although, jason, calls, medea, most, hateful, to, gods, and, men, the, fact, that, the, chariot, is, given, to, her, by, helios, indicates, that, she, still, has, the, gods, on, her, side, as, bernard, knox, points, out, medea, s, last, scene, with, concluding, appearances, parallels, that, of, a, number, of, indisputably, divine, beings, in, other, plays, by, euripides, just, like, these, gods, medea, interrupts, and, puts, a, stop, to, the, violent, action, of, the, human, being, on, the, lower, level, justifies, her, savage, revenge, on, the, grounds, that, she, has, been, treated, with, disrespect, and, mockery, takes, measures, and, gives, orders, for, the, burial, of, the, dead, prophesies, the, future, and, announces, the, foundation, of, a, cult, she, then, escapes, to, athens, in, the, divine, chariot, the, chorus, is, left, contemplating, the, will, of, zeus, in, medea, s, actions, manifold, are, thy, shapings, providence, many, a, hopeless, matter, gods, arrange, what, we, expected, never, came, to, pass, what, we, did, not, expect, the, gods, brought, to, bear, so, have, things, gone, this, whole, experience, through, this, deliberate, murder, of, her, children, by, medea, appears, to, be, euripides, invention, although, some, scholars, believe, neophron, created, this, alternate, tradition, her, filicide, would, go, on, to, become, the, standard, for, later, writers, pausanias, writing, in, the, late, 2nd, century, ad, records, five, different, versions, of, what, happened, to, medea, s, children, after, reporting, that, he, has, seen, a, monument, for, them, while, traveling, in, corinth, the, play, s, popularity, in, ancient, greece, may, have, been, due, in, part, to, its, portrayal, of, a, strong, independent, woman, who, defies, patriarchal, norms
