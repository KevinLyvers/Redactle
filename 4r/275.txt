most, important, and, most, often, translated, works, of, old, english, literature, the, date, of, composition, is, a, matter, of, contention, among, scholars, the, only, certain, dating, is, for, the, manuscript, which, was, produced, between, 975, and, 1025, ad, scholars, call, the, anonymous, author, the, beowulf, poet, the, story, is, set, in, pagan, scandinavia, in, the, 5th, and, 6th, centuries, beowulf, a, hero, of, the, geats, comes, to, the, aid, of, hrothgar, the, king, of, the, danes, whose, mead, hall, heorot, has, been, under, attack, by, the, monster, grendel, for, twelve, years, after, beowulf, slays, him, grendel, s, mother, takes, revenge, and, is, in, turn, defeated, victorious, beowulf, goes, home, to, geatland, and, becomes, king, of, the, geats, fifty, years, later, beowulf, defeats, a, dragon, but, is, mortally, wounded, in, the, battle, after, his, death, his, attendants, cremate, his, body, and, erect, a, barrow, on, a, headland, in, his, memory, scholars, have, debated, whether, beowulf, was, transmitted, orally, affecting, its, interpretation, if, it, was, composed, early, in, pagan, times, then, the, paganism, is, central, and, the, christian, elements, were, added, later, whereas, if, it, was, composed, later, in, writing, by, a, christian, then, the, pagan, elements, could, be, decorative, archaising, some, scholars, also, hold, an, intermediate, position, beowulf, is, written, mostly, in, the, late, west, saxon, dialect, of, old, english, but, many, other, dialectal, forms, are, present, suggesting, that, the, poem, may, have, had, a, long, and, complex, transmission, throughout, the, dialect, areas, of, england, there, has, long, been, research, into, similarities, with, other, traditions, and, accounts, including, the, icelandic, grettis, saga, the, norse, story, of, hrolf, kraki, and, his, bear, shapeshifting, servant, bodvar, bjarki, the, international, folktale, the, bear, s, son, tale, and, the, irish, folktale, of, the, hand, and, the, child, persistent, attempts, have, been, made, to, link, beowulf, to, tales, from, homer, s, odyssey, or, virgil, s, aeneid, more, definite, are, biblical, parallels, with, clear, allusions, to, the, books, of, genesis, exodus, and, daniel, the, poem, survives, in, a, single, copy, in, the, manuscript, known, as, the, nowell, codex, it, has, no, title, in, the, original, manuscript, but, has, become, known, by, the, name, of, the, story, s, protagonist, in, 1731, the, manuscript, was, damaged, by, a, fire, that, swept, through, ashburnham, house, in, london, which, was, housing, sir, robert, cotton, s, collection, of, medieval, manuscripts, it, survived, but, the, margins, were, charred, and, some, readings, were, lost, the, nowell, codex, is, housed, in, the, british, library, the, poem, was, first, transcribed, in, 1786, some, verses, were, first, translated, into, modern, english, in, 1805, and, nine, complete, translations, were, made, in, the, 19th, century, including, those, by, john, mitchell, kemble, and, william, morris, after, 1900, hundreds, of, translations, whether, into, prose, rhyming, verse, or, alliterative, verse, were, made, some, relatively, faithful, some, archaising, some, attempting, to, domesticate, the, work, among, the, best, known, modern, translations, are, those, of, edwin, morgan, burton, raffel, michael, j, alexander, roy, liuzza, and, seamus, heaney, the, difficulty, of, translating, beowulf, has, been, explored, by, scholars, including, j, r, r, tolkien, in, his, essay, on, translating, beowulf, who, worked, on, a, verse, and, a, prose, translation, of, his, own, the, events, in, the, poem, take, place, over, the, 5th, and, 6th, centuries, and, feature, predominantly, non, english, characters, some, suggest, that, beowulf, was, first, composed, in, the, 7th, century, at, rendlesham, in, east, anglia, as, the, sutton, hoo, ship, burial, shows, close, connections, with, scandinavia, and, the, east, anglian, royal, dynasty, the, wuffingas, may, have, been, descendants, of, the, geatish, wulfings, others, have, associated, this, poem, with, the, court, of, king, alfred, the, great, or, with, the, court, of, king, cnut, the, great, the, poem, blends, fictional, legendary, mythic, and, historical, elements, although, beowulf, himself, is, not, mentioned, in, any, other, old, english, manuscript, many, of, the, other, figures, named, in, beowulf, appear, in, scandinavian, sources, this, concerns, not, only, individuals, e, g, healfdene, hro, gar, halga, hro, ulf, eadgils, and, ohthere, but, also, clans, e, g, scyldings, scylfings, and, wulfings, and, certain, events, e, g, the, battle, between, eadgils, and, onela, the, raid, by, king, hygelac, into, frisia, is, mentioned, by, gregory, of, tours, in, his, history, of, the, franks, and, can, be, dated, to, around, 521, the, majority, view, appears, to, be, that, figures, such, as, king, hrothgar, and, the, scyldings, in, beowulf, are, based, on, historical, people, from, 6th, century, scandinavia, like, the, finnesburg, fragment, and, several, shorter, surviving, poems, beowulf, has, consequently, been, used, as, a, source, of, information, about, scandinavian, figures, such, as, eadgils, and, hygelac, and, about, continental, germanic, figures, such, as, offa, king, of, the, continental, angles, however, the, scholar, roy, liuzza, argues, that, the, poem, is, frustratingly, ambivalent, neither, myth, nor, folktale, but, is, set, against, a, complex, background, of, legendary, history, on, a, roughly, recognizable, map, of, scandinavia, and, comments, that, the, geats, of, the, poem, may, correspond, with, the, gautar, of, modern, g, taland, or, perhaps, the, legendary, getae, nineteenth, century, archaeological, evidence, may, confirm, elements, of, the, beowulf, story, eadgils, was, buried, at, uppsala, gamla, uppsala, sweden, according, to, snorri, sturluson, when, the, western, mound, to, the, left, in, the, photo, was, excavated, in, 1874, the, finds, showed, that, a, powerful, man, was, buried, in, a, large, barrow, c, 575, on, a, bear, skin, with, two, dogs, and, rich, grave, offerings, the, eastern, mound, was, excavated, in, 1854, and, contained, the, remains, of, a, woman, or, a, woman, and, a, young, man, the, middle, barrow, has, not, been, excavated, in, denmark, recent, 1986, 88, 2004, 05, archaeological, excavations, at, lejre, where, scandinavian, tradition, located, the, seat, of, the, scyldings, heorot, have, revealed, that, a, hall, was, built, in, the, mid, 6th, century, matching, the, period, described, in, beowulf, some, centuries, before, the, poem, was, composed, three, halls, each, about, 50, metres, 160, ft, long, were, found, during, the, excavation, the, protagonist, beowulf, a, hero, of, the, geats, comes, to, the, aid, of, hrothgar, king, of, the, danes, whose, great, hall, heorot, is, plagued, by, the, monster, grendel, beowulf, kills, grendel, with, his, bare, hands, then, kills, grendel, s, mother, with, a, giant, s, sword, that, he, found, in, her, lair, later, in, his, life, beowulf, becomes, king, of, the, geats, and, finds, his, realm, terrorised, by, a, dragon, some, of, whose, treasure, had, been, stolen, from, his, hoard, in, a, burial, mound, he, attacks, the, dragon, with, the, help, of, his, thegns, or, servants, but, they, do, not, succeed, beowulf, decides, to, follow, the, dragon, to, its, lair, at, earnan, s, but, only, his, young, swedish, relative, wiglaf, whose, name, means, remnant, of, valour, dares, to, join, him, beowulf, finally, slays, the, dragon, but, is, mortally, wounded, in, the, struggle, he, is, cremated, and, a, burial, mound, by, the, sea, is, erected, in, his, honour, beowulf, is, considered, an, epic, poem, in, that, the, main, character, is, a, hero, who, travels, great, distances, to, prove, his, strength, at, impossible, odds, against, supernatural, demons, and, beasts, the, poem, begins, in, medias, res, or, simply, in, the, middle, of, things, a, characteristic, of, the, epics, of, antiquity, although, the, poem, begins, with, beowulf, s, arrival, grendel, s, attacks, have, been, ongoing, an, elaborate, history, of, characters, and, their, lineages, is, spoken, of, as, well, as, their, interactions, with, each, other, debts, owed, and, repaid, and, deeds, of, valour, the, warriors, form, a, brotherhood, linked, by, loyalty, to, their, lord, the, poem, begins, and, ends, with, funerals, at, the, beginning, of, the, poem, for, scyld, scefing, and, at, the, end, for, beowulf, the, poem, is, tightly, structured, e, carrigan, shows, the, symmetry, of, its, design, in, a, model, of, its, major, components, with, for, instance, the, account, of, the, killing, of, grendel, matching, that, of, the, killing, of, the, dragon, the, glory, of, the, danes, matching, the, accounts, of, the, danish, and, geatish, courts, other, analyses, are, possible, as, well, gale, owen, crocker, for, instance, sees, the, poem, as, structured, by, the, four, funerals, it, describes, for, j, r, r, tolkien, the, primary, division, in, the, poem, was, between, young, and, old, beowulf, beowulf, begins, with, the, story, of, hrothgar, who, constructed, the, great, hall, heorot, for, himself, and, his, warriors, in, it, he, his, wife, wealhtheow, and, his, warriors, spend, their, time, singing, and, celebrating, grendel, a, troll, like, monster, said, to, be, descended, from, the, biblical, cain, is, pained, by, the, sounds, of, joy, grendel, attacks, the, hall, and, devours, many, of, hrothgar, s, warriors, while, they, sleep, hrothgar, and, his, people, helpless, against, grendel, abandon, heorot, beowulf, a, young, warrior, from, geatland, hears, of, hrothgar, s, troubles, and, with, his, king, s, permission, leaves, his, homeland, to, assist, hrothgar, beowulf, and, his, men, spend, the, night, in, heorot, beowulf, refuses, to, use, any, weapon, because, he, holds, himself, to, be, grendel, s, equal, when, grendel, enters, the, hall, and, kills, one, of, beowulf, s, men, beowulf, who, has, been, feigning, sleep, leaps, up, to, clench, grendel, s, hand, grendel, and, beowulf, battle, each, other, violently, beowulf, s, retainers, draw, their, swords, and, rush, to, his, aid, but, their, blades, cannot, pierce, grendel, s, skin, finally, beowulf, tears, grendel, s, arm, from, his, body, at, the, shoulder, and, grendel, runs, to, his, home, in, the, marshes, where, he, dies, beowulf, displays, the, whole, of, grendel, s, shoulder, and, arm, his, awesome, grasp, for, all, to, see, at, heorot, this, display, would, fuel, grendel, s, mother, s, anger, in, revenge, the, next, night, after, celebrating, grendel, s, defeat, hrothgar, and, his, men, sleep, in, heorot, grendel, s, mother, angry, that, her, son, has, been, killed, sets, out, to, get, revenge, beowulf, was, elsewhere, earlier, after, the, award, of, treasure, the, geat, had, been, given, another, lodging, his, assistance, would, be, absent, in, this, battle, grendel, s, mother, violently, kills, schere, who, is, hrothgar, s, most, loyal, fighter, and, escapes, hrothgar, beowulf, and, their, men, track, grendel, s, mother, to, her, lair, under, a, lake, unfer, a, warrior, who, had, earlier, challenged, him, presents, beowulf, with, his, sword, hrunting, after, stipulating, a, number, of, conditions, to, hrothgar, in, case, of, his, death, including, the, taking, in, of, his, kinsmen, and, the, inheritance, by, unferth, of, beowulf, s, estate, beowulf, jumps, into, the, lake, and, while, harassed, by, water, monsters, gets, to, the, bottom, where, he, finds, a, cavern, grendel, s, mother, pulls, him, in, and, she, and, beowulf, engage, in, fierce, combat, at, first, grendel, s, mother, prevails, and, hrunting, proves, incapable, of, hurting, her, she, throws, beowulf, to, the, ground, and, sitting, astride, him, tries, to, kill, him, with, a, short, sword, but, beowulf, is, saved, by, his, armour, beowulf, spots, another, sword, hanging, on, the, wall, and, apparently, made, for, giants, and, cuts, her, head, off, with, it, travelling, further, into, grendel, s, mother, s, lair, beowulf, discovers, grendel, s, corpse, and, severs, his, head, with, the, sword, its, blade, melts, because, of, the, monster, s, hot, blood, leaving, only, the, hilt, beowulf, swims, back, up, to, the, edge, of, the, lake, where, his, men, wait, carrying, the, hilt, of, the, sword, and, grendel, s, head, he, presents, them, to, hrothgar, upon, his, return, to, heorot, hrothgar, gives, beowulf, many, gifts, including, the, sword, n, gling, his, family, s, heirloom, the, events, prompt, a, long, reflection, by, the, king, sometimes, referred, to, as, hrothgar, s, sermon, in, which, he, urges, beowulf, to, be, wary, of, pride, and, to, reward, his, thegns, beowulf, returns, home, and, eventually, becomes, king, of, his, own, people, one, day, fifty, years, after, beowulf, s, battle, with, grendel, s, mother, a, slave, steals, a, golden, cup, from, the, lair, of, a, dragon, at, earnan, s, when, the, dragon, sees, that, the, cup, has, been, stolen, it, leaves, its, cave, in, a, rage, burning, everything, in, sight, beowulf, and, his, warriors, come, to, fight, the, dragon, but, beowulf, tells, his, men, that, he, will, fight, the, dragon, alone, and, that, they, should, wait, on, the, barrow, beowulf, descends, to, do, battle, with, the, dragon, but, finds, himself, outmatched, his, men, upon, seeing, this, and, fearing, for, their, lives, retreat, into, the, woods, one, of, his, men, wiglaf, however, in, great, distress, at, beowulf, s, plight, comes, to, his, aid, the, two, slay, the, dragon, but, beowulf, is, mortally, wounded, after, beowulf, dies, wiglaf, remains, by, his, side, grief, stricken, when, the, rest, of, the, men, finally, return, wiglaf, bitterly, admonishes, them, blaming, their, cowardice, for, beowulf, s, death, beowulf, is, ritually, burned, on, a, great, pyre, in, geatland, while, his, people, wail, and, mourn, him, fearing, that, without, him, the, geats, are, defenceless, against, attacks, from, surrounding, tribes, afterwards, a, barrow, visible, from, the, sea, is, built, in, his, memory, the, poem, contains, many, apparent, digressions, from, the, main, story, these, were, found, troublesome, by, early, beowulf, scholars, such, as, frederick, klaeber, who, wrote, that, they, interrupt, the, story, w, w, lawrence, who, stated, that, they, clog, the, action, and, distract, attention, from, it, and, w, p, ker, who, found, some, irrelevant, possibly, interpolations, more, recent, scholars, from, adrien, bonjour, onwards, note, that, the, digressions, can, all, be, explained, as, introductions, or, comparisons, with, elements, of, the, main, story, for, instance, beowulf, s, swimming, home, across, the, sea, from, frisia, carrying, thirty, sets, of, armour, emphasises, his, heroic, strength, the, digressions, can, be, divided, into, four, groups, namely, the, scyld, narrative, at, the, start, many, descriptions, of, the, geats, including, the, swedish, geatish, wars, the, lay, of, the, last, survivor, in, the, style, of, another, old, english, poem, the, wanderer, and, beowulf, s, dealings, with, the, geats, such, as, his, verbal, contest, with, unferth, and, his, swimming, duel, with, breca, and, the, tale, of, sigemund, and, the, dragon, history, and, legend, including, the, fight, at, finnsburg, and, the, tale, of, freawaru, and, ingeld, and, biblical, tales, such, as, the, creation, myth, and, cain, as, ancestor, of, all, monsters, the, digressions, provide, a, powerful, impression, of, historical, depth, imitated, by, tolkien, in, the, lord, of, the, rings, a, work, that, embodies, many, other, elements, from, the, poem, the, dating, of, beowulf, has, attracted, considerable, scholarly, attention, opinion, differs, as, to, whether, it, was, first, written, in, the, 8th, century, whether, it, was, nearly, contemporary, with, its, 11th, century, manuscript, and, whether, a, proto, version, possibly, a, version, of, the, bear, s, son, tale, was, orally, transmitted, before, being, transcribed, in, its, present, form, albert, lord, felt, strongly, that, the, manuscript, represents, the, transcription, of, a, performance, though, likely, taken, at, more, than, one, sitting, j, r, r, tolkien, believed, that, the, poem, retains, too, genuine, a, memory, of, anglo, saxon, paganism, to, have, been, composed, more, than, a, few, generations, after, the, completion, of, the, christianisation, of, england, around, ad, 700, and, tolkien, s, conviction, that, the, poem, dates, to, the, 8th, century, has, been, defended, by, scholars, including, tom, shippey, leonard, neidorf, rafael, j, pascual, and, robert, d, fulk, an, analysis, of, several, old, english, poems, by, a, team, including, neidorf, suggests, that, beowulf, is, the, work, of, a, single, author, though, other, scholars, disagree, the, claim, to, an, early, 11th, century, date, depends, in, part, on, scholars, who, argue, that, rather, than, the, transcription, of, a, tale, from, the, oral, tradition, by, an, earlier, literate, monk, beowulf, reflects, an, original, interpretation, of, an, earlier, version, of, the, story, by, the, manuscript, s, two, scribes, on, the, other, hand, some, scholars, argue, that, linguistic, palaeographical, handwriting, metrical, poetic, structure, and, onomastic, naming, considerations, align, to, support, a, date, of, composition, in, the, first, half, of, the, 8th, century, in, particular, the, poem, s, apparent, observation, of, etymological, vowel, length, distinctions, in, unstressed, syllables, described, by, kaluza, s, law, has, been, thought, to, demonstrate, a, date, of, composition, prior, to, the, earlier, ninth, century, however, scholars, disagree, about, whether, the, metrical, phenomena, described, by, kaluza, s, law, prove, an, early, date, of, composition, or, are, evidence, of, a, longer, prehistory, of, the, beowulf, metre, b, r, hutcheson, for, instance, does, not, believe, kaluza, s, law, can, be, used, to, date, the, poem, while, claiming, that, the, weight, of, all, the, evidence, fulk, presents, in, his, book, tells, strongly, in, favour, of, an, eighth, century, date, from, an, analysis, of, creative, genealogy, and, ethnicity, craig, r, davis, suggests, a, composition, date, in, the, ad, 890s, when, king, alfred, of, england, had, secured, the, submission, of, guthrum, leader, of, a, division, of, the, great, heathen, army, of, the, danes, and, of, aethelred, ealdorman, of, mercia, in, this, thesis, the, trend, of, appropriating, gothic, royal, ancestry, established, in, francia, during, charlemagne, s, reign, influenced, the, anglian, kingdoms, of, britain, to, attribute, to, themselves, a, geatish, descent, the, composition, of, beowulf, was, the, fruit, of, the, later, adaptation, of, this, trend, in, alfred, s, policy, of, asserting, authority, over, the, angelcynn, in, which, scyldic, descent, was, attributed, to, the, west, saxon, royal, pedigree, this, date, of, composition, largely, agrees, with, lapidge, s, positing, of, a, west, saxon, exemplar, c, 900, the, location, of, the, poem, s, composition, is, intensely, disputed, in, 1914, f, w, moorman, the, first, professor, of, english, language, at, university, of, leeds, claimed, that, beowulf, was, composed, in, yorkshire, but, e, talbot, donaldson, claims, that, it, was, probably, composed, during, the, first, half, of, the, eighth, century, and, that, the, writer, was, a, native, of, what, was, then, called, west, mercia, located, in, the, western, midlands, of, england, however, the, late, tenth, century, manuscript, which, alone, preserves, the, poem, originated, in, the, kingdom, of, the, west, saxons, as, it, is, more, commonly, known, beowulf, survived, to, modern, times, in, a, single, manuscript, written, in, ink, on, parchment, later, damaged, by, fire, the, manuscript, measures, 245, 185, mm, the, poem, is, known, only, from, a, single, manuscript, estimated, to, date, from, around, 975, 1025, in, which, it, appears, with, other, works, the, manuscript, therefore, dates, either, to, the, reign, of, thelred, the, unready, characterised, by, strife, with, the, danish, king, sweyn, forkbeard, or, to, the, beginning, of, the, reign, of, sweyn, s, son, cnut, the, great, from, 1016, the, beowulf, manuscript, is, known, as, the, nowell, codex, gaining, its, name, from, 16th, century, scholar, laurence, nowell, the, official, designation, is, british, library, cotton, vitellius, a, xv, because, it, was, one, of, sir, robert, bruce, cotton, s, holdings, in, the, cotton, library, in, the, middle, of, the, 17th, century, many, private, antiquarians, and, book, collectors, such, as, sir, robert, cotton, used, their, own, library, classification, systems, cotton, vitellius, a, xv, translates, as, the, 15th, book, from, the, left, on, shelf, a, the, top, shelf, of, the, bookcase, with, the, bust, of, roman, emperor, vitellius, standing, on, top, of, it, in, cotton, s, collection, kevin, kiernan, argues, that, nowell, most, likely, acquired, it, through, william, cecil, 1st, baron, burghley, in, 1563, when, nowell, entered, cecil, s, household, as, a, tutor, to, his, ward, edward, de, vere, 17th, earl, of, oxford, the, earliest, extant, reference, to, the, first, foliation, of, the, nowell, codex, was, made, sometime, between, 1628, and, 1650, by, franciscus, junius, the, younger, the, ownership, of, the, codex, before, nowell, remains, a, mystery, the, reverend, thomas, smith, 1638, 1710, and, humfrey, wanley, 1672, 1726, both, catalogued, the, cotton, library, in, which, the, nowell, codex, was, held, smith, s, catalogue, appeared, in, 1696, and, wanley, s, in, 1705, the, beowulf, manuscript, itself, is, identified, by, name, for, the, first, time, in, an, exchange, of, letters, in, 1700, between, george, hickes, wanley, s, assistant, and, wanley, in, the, letter, to, wanley, hickes, responds, to, an, apparent, charge, against, smith, made, by, wanley, that, smith, had, failed, to, mention, the, beowulf, script, when, cataloguing, cotton, ms, vitellius, a, xv, hickes, replies, to, wanley, i, can, find, nothing, yet, of, beowulph, kiernan, theorised, that, smith, failed, to, mention, the, beowulf, manuscript, because, of, his, reliance, on, previous, catalogues, or, because, either, he, had, no, idea, how, to, describe, it, or, because, it, was, temporarily, out, of, the, codex, the, manuscript, passed, to, crown, ownership, in, 1702, on, the, death, of, its, then, owner, sir, john, cotton, who, had, inherited, it, from, his, grandfather, robert, cotton, it, suffered, damage, in, a, fire, at, ashburnham, house, in, 1731, in, which, around, a, quarter, of, the, manuscripts, bequeathed, by, cotton, were, destroyed, since, then, parts, of, the, manuscript, have, crumbled, along, with, many, of, the, letters, rebinding, efforts, though, saving, the, manuscript, from, much, degeneration, have, nonetheless, covered, up, other, letters, of, the, poem, causing, further, loss, kiernan, in, preparing, his, electronic, edition, of, the, manuscript, used, fibre, optic, backlighting, and, ultraviolet, lighting, to, reveal, letters, in, the, manuscript, lost, from, binding, erasure, or, ink, blotting, the, beowulf, manuscript, was, transcribed, from, an, original, by, two, scribes, one, of, whom, wrote, the, prose, at, the, beginning, of, the, manuscript, and, the, first, 1939, lines, before, breaking, off, in, mid, sentence, the, first, scribe, made, a, point, of, carefully, regularizing, the, spelling, of, the, original, document, into, the, common, west, saxon, removing, any, archaic, or, dialectical, features, the, second, scribe, who, wrote, the, remainder, with, a, difference, in, handwriting, noticeable, after, line, 1939, seems, to, have, written, more, vigorously, and, with, less, interest, as, a, result, the, second, scribe, s, script, retains, more, archaic, dialectic, features, which, allow, modern, scholars, to, ascribe, the, poem, a, cultural, context, while, both, scribes, appear, to, have, proofread, their, work, there, are, nevertheless, many, errors, the, second, scribe, was, ultimately, the, more, conservative, copyist, as, he, did, not, modify, the, spelling, of, the, text, as, he, wrote, but, copied, what, he, saw, in, front, of, him, in, the, way, that, it, is, currently, bound, the, beowulf, manuscript, is, followed, by, the, old, english, poem, judith, judith, was, written, by, the, same, scribe, that, completed, beowulf, as, evidenced, by, similar, writing, style, wormholes, found, in, the, last, leaves, of, the, beowulf, manuscript, that, are, absent, in, the, judith, manuscript, suggest, that, at, one, point, beowulf, ended, the, volume, the, rubbed, appearance, of, some, leaves, suggests, that, the, manuscript, stood, on, a, shelf, unbound, as, was, the, case, with, other, old, english, manuscripts, knowledge, of, books, held, in, the, library, at, malmesbury, abbey, and, available, as, source, works, as, well, as, the, identification, of, certain, words, particular, to, the, local, dialect, found, in, the, text, suggest, that, the, transcription, may, have, taken, place, there, the, scholar, roy, liuzza, notes, that, the, practice, of, oral, poetry, is, by, its, nature, invisible, to, history, as, evidence, is, in, writing, comparison, with, other, bodies, of, verse, such, as, homer, s, coupled, with, ethnographic, observation, of, early, 20th, century, performers, has, provided, a, vision, of, how, an, anglo, saxon, singer, poet, or, scop, may, have, practised, the, resulting, model, is, that, performance, was, based, on, traditional, stories, and, a, repertoire, of, word, formulae, that, fitted, the, traditional, metre, the, scop, moved, through, the, scenes, such, as, putting, on, armour, or, crossing, the, sea, each, one, improvised, at, each, telling, with, differing, combinations, of, the, stock, phrases, while, the, basic, story, and, style, remained, the, same, liuzza, notes, that, beowulf, itself, describes, the, technique, of, a, court, poet, in, assembling, materials, in, lines, 867, 874, in, his, translation, full, of, grand, stories, mindful, of, songs, found, other, words, truly, bound, together, to, recite, with, skill, the, adventure, of, beowulf, adeptly, tell, a, tall, tale, and, wordum, wrixlan, weave, his, words, the, poem, further, mentions, lines, 1065, 1068, that, the, harp, was, touched, tales, often, told, when, hrothgar, s, scop, was, set, to, recite, among, the, mead, tables, his, hall, entertainment, the, question, of, whether, beowulf, was, passed, down, through, oral, tradition, prior, to, its, present, manuscript, form, has, been, the, subject, of, much, debate, and, involves, more, than, simply, the, issue, of, its, composition, rather, given, the, implications, of, the, theory, of, oral, formulaic, composition, and, oral, tradition, the, question, concerns, how, the, poem, is, to, be, understood, and, what, sorts, of, interpretations, are, legitimate, in, his, landmark, 1960, work, the, singer, of, tales, albert, lord, citing, the, work, of, francis, peabody, magoun, and, others, considered, it, proven, that, beowulf, was, composed, orally, later, scholars, have, not, all, been, convinced, they, agree, that, themes, like, arming, the, hero, or, the, hero, on, the, beach, do, exist, across, germanic, works, some, scholars, conclude, that, anglo, saxon, poetry, is, a, mix, of, oral, formulaic, and, literate, patterns, larry, benson, proposed, that, germanic, literature, contains, kernels, of, tradition, which, beowulf, expands, upon, ann, watts, argued, against, the, imperfect, application, of, one, theory, to, two, different, traditions, traditional, homeric, oral, formulaic, poetry, and, anglo, saxon, poetry, thomas, gardner, agreed, with, watts, arguing, that, the, beowulf, text, is, too, varied, to, be, completely, constructed, from, set, formulae, and, themes, john, miles, foley, wrote, that, comparative, work, must, observe, the, particularities, of, a, given, tradition, in, his, view, there, was, a, fluid, continuum, from, traditionality, to, textuality, many, editions, of,

and, was, therefore, in, some, ways, more, likely, to, make, transcription, errors, but, in, other, ways, more, likely, to, copy, exactly, what, he, saw, and, then, made, a, copy, himself, since,

source, texts, or, influences, would, suggest, time, frames, of, composition, geographic, boundaries, within, which, it, could, be, composed, or, range, both, spatial, and, temporal, of, influence, i, e, when, it, was, popular, and, where, its, popularity, took, it, the, poem, has, been, related, to, scandinavian, celtic, and, international, folkloric, sources, 19th, century, studies, proposed, that, beowulf, was, translated, from, a, lost, original, scandinavian, work, surviving, scandinavian, works, have, continued, to, be, studied, as, possible, sources, in, 1886, gregor, sarrazin, suggested, that, an, old, norse, original, version, of, beowulf, must, have, existed, but, in, 1914, carl, wilhelm, von, sydow, claimed, that, beowulf, is, fundamentally, christian, and, was, written, at, a, time, when, any, norse, tale, would, have, most, likely, been, pagan, another, proposal, was, a, parallel, with, the, grettis, saga, but, in, 1998, magn, s, fjalldal, challenged, that, stating, that, tangential, similarities, were, being, overemphasised, as, analogies, the, story, of, hrolf, kraki, and, his, servant, the, legendary, bear, shapeshifter, bodvar, bjarki, has, also, been, suggested, as, a, possible, parallel, he, survives, in, hr, lfs, saga, kraka, and, saxo, s, gesta, danorum, while, hrolf, kraki, one, of, the, scyldings, appears, as, hrothulf, in, beowulf, new, scandinavian, analogues, to, beowulf, continue, to, be, proposed, regularly, with, hr, lfs, saga, gautrekssonar, being, the, most, recently, adduced, text, friedrich, panzer, 1910, wrote, a, thesis, that, the, first, part, of, beowulf, the, grendel, story, incorporated, preexisting, folktale, material, and, that, the, folktale, in, question, was, of, the, bear, s, son, tale, b, rensohnm, rchen, type, which, has, surviving, examples, all, over, the, world, this, tale, type, was, later, catalogued, as, international, folktale, type, 301, in, the, atu, index, now, formally, entitled, the, three, stolen, princesses, type, in, hans, uther, s, catalogue, although, the, bear, s, son, is, still, used, in, beowulf, criticism, if, not, so, much, in, folkloristic, circles, however, although, this, folkloristic, approach, was, seen, as, a, step, in, the, right, direction, the, bear, s, son, tale, has, later, been, regarded, by, many, as, not, a, close, enough, parallel, to, be, a, viable, choice, later, peter, a, jorgensen, looking, for, a, more, concise, frame, of, reference, coined, a, two, troll, tradition, that, covers, both, beowulf, and, grettis, saga, a, norse, ecotype, in, which, a, hero, enters, a, cave, and, kills, two, giants, usually, of, different, sexes, this, has, emerged, as, a, more, attractive, folk, tale, parallel, according, to, a, 1998, assessment, by, andersson, the, epic, s, similarity, to, the, irish, folktale, the, hand, and, the, child, was, noted, in, 1899, by, albert, s, cook, and, others, even, earlier, in, 1914, the, swedish, folklorist, carl, wilhelm, von, sydow, made, a, strong, argument, for, parallelism, with, the, hand, and, the, child, because, the, folktale, type, demonstrated, a, monstrous, arm, motif, that, corresponded, with, beowulf, s, wrenching, off, grendel, s, arm, no, such, correspondence, could, be, perceived, in, the, bear, s, son, tale, or, in, the, grettis, saga, james, carney, and, martin, puhvel, agree, with, this, hand, and, the, child, contextualisation, puhvel, supported, the, hand, and, the, child, theory, through, such, motifs, as, in, andersson, s, words, the, more, powerful, giant, mother, the, mysterious, light, in, the, cave, the, melting, of, the, sword, in, blood, the, phenomenon, of, battle, rage, swimming, prowess, combat, with, water, monsters, underwater, adventures, and, the, bear, hug, style, of, wrestling, in, the, mabinogion, teyrnon, discovers, the, otherworldly, boy, child, pryderi, the, principal, character, of, the, cycle, after, cutting, off, the, arm, of, a, monstrous, beast, which, is, stealing, foals, from, his, stables, the, medievalist, r, mark, scowcroft, notes, that, the, tearing, off, of, the, monster, s, arm, without, a, weapon, is, found, only, in, beowulf, and, fifteen, of, the, irish, variants, of, the, tale, he, identifies, twelve, parallels, between, the, tale, and, beowulf, attempts, to, find, classical, or, late, latin, influence, or, analogue, in, beowulf, are, almost, exclusively, linked, with, homer, s, odyssey, or, virgil, s, aeneid, in, 1926, albert, s, cook, suggested, a, homeric, connection, due, to, equivalent, formulas, metonymies, and, analogous, voyages, in, 1930, james, a, work, supported, the, homeric, influence, stating, that, encounter, between, beowulf, and, unferth, was, parallel, to, the, encounter, between, odysseus, and, euryalus, in, books, 7, 8, of, the, odyssey, even, to, the, point, of, both, characters, giving, the, hero, the, same, gift, of, a, sword, upon, being, proven, wrong, in, their, initial, assessment, of, the, hero, s, prowess, this, theory, of, homer, s, influence, on, beowulf, remained, very, prevalent, in, the, 1920s, but, started, to, die, out, in, the, following, decade, when, a, handful, of, critics, stated, that, the, two, works, were, merely, comparative, literature, although, greek, was, known, in, late, 7th, century, england, bede, states, that, theodore, of, tarsus, a, greek, was, appointed, archbishop, of, canterbury, in, 668, and, he, taught, greek, several, english, scholars, and, churchmen, are, described, by, bede, as, being, fluent, in, greek, due, to, being, taught, by, him, bede, claims, to, be, fluent, in, greek, himself, frederick, klaeber, among, others, argued, for, a, connection, between, beowulf, and, virgil, near, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, claiming, that, the, very, act, of, writing, a, secular, epic, in, a, germanic, world, represents, virgilian, influence, virgil, was, seen, as, the, pinnacle, of, latin, literature, and, latin, was, the, dominant, literary, language, of, england, at, the, time, therefore, making, virgilian, influence, highly, likely, similarly, in, 1971, alistair, campbell, stated, that, the, apologue, technique, used, in, beowulf, is, so, rare, in, epic, poetry, aside, from, virgil, that, the, poet, who, composed, beowulf, could, not, have, written, the, poem, in, such, a, manner, without, first, coming, across, virgil, s, writings, it, cannot, be, denied, that, biblical, parallels, occur, in, the, text, whether, seen, as, a, pagan, work, with, christian, colouring, added, by, scribes, or, as, a, christian, historical, novel, with, selected, bits, of, paganism, deliberately, laid, on, as, local, colour, as, margaret, e, goldsmith, did, in, the, christian, theme, of, beowulf, beowulf, channels, the, book, of, genesis, the, book, of, exodus, and, the, book, of, daniel, in, its, inclusion, of, references, to, the, genesis, creation, narrative, the, story, of, cain, and, abel, noah, and, the, flood, the, devil, hell, and, the, last, judgment, beowulf, predominantly, uses, the, west, saxon, dialect, of, old, english, like, other, old, english, poems, copied, at, the, time, however, it, also, uses, many, other, linguistic, forms, this, leads, some, scholars, to, believe, that, it, has, endured, a, long, and, complicated, transmission, through, all, the, main, dialect, areas, it, retains, a, complicated, mix, of, mercian, northumbrian, early, west, saxon, anglian, kentish, and, late, west, saxon, dialectical, forms, old, english, poets, typically, used, alliterative, verse, a, form, of, verse, in, which, the, first, half, of, the, line, the, a, verse, is, linked, to, the, second, half, the, b, verse, through, similarity, in, initial, sound, that, the, line, consists, of, two, halves, is, clearly, indicated, by, the, caesura, oft, sc, yld, sc, efing, sc, ea, ena, reatum, l, 4, this, verse, form, maps, stressed, and, unstressed, syllables, onto, abstract, entities, known, as, metrical, positions, there, is, no, fixed, number, of, beats, per, line, the, first, one, cited, has, three, oft, scyld, scef, ing, whereas, the, second, has, two, scea, ena, reatum, the, poet, had, a, choice, of, formulae, to, assist, in, fulfilling, the, alliteration, scheme, these, were, memorised, phrases, that, conveyed, a, general, and, commonly, occurring, meaning, that, fitted, neatly, into, a, half, line, of, the, chanted, poem, examples, are, line, 8, s, weox, under, wolcnum, waxed, under, welkin, i, e, he, grew, up, under, the, heavens, line, 11, s, gomban, gyldan, pay, tribute, line, 13, s, geong, in, geardum, young, in, the, yards, i, e, young, in, the, courts, and, line, 14, s, folce, to, frofre, as, a, comfort, to, his, people, kennings, are, a, significant, technique, in, beowulf, they, are, evocative, poetic, descriptions, of, everyday, things, often, created, to, fill, the, alliterative, requirements, of, the, metre, for, example, a, poet, might, call, the, sea, the, swan, s, riding, a, king, might, be, called, a, ring, giver, the, poem, contains, many, kennings, and, the, device, is, typical, of, much, of, classic, poetry, in, old, english, which, is, heavily, formulaic, the, poem, too, makes, extensive, use, of, elided, metaphors, the, history, of, modern, beowulf, criticism, is, often, said, to, begin, with, tolkien, author, and, merton, professor, of, anglo, saxon, at, the, university, of, oxford, who, in, his, 1936, lecture, to, the, british, academy, criticised, his, contemporaries, excessive, interest, in, its, historical, implications, he, noted, in, beowulf, the, monsters, and, the, critics, that, as, a, result, the, poem, s, literary, value, had, been, largely, overlooked, and, argued, that, the, poem, is, in, fact, so, interesting, as, poetry, in, places, poetry, so, powerful, that, this, quite, overshadows, the, historical, content, tolkien, argued, that, the, poem, is, not, an, epic, that, while, no, conventional, term, exactly, fits, the, nearest, would, be, elegy, and, that, its, focus, is, the, concluding, dirge, in, historical, terms, the, poem, s, characters, were, germanic, pagans, yet, the, poem, was, recorded, by, christian, anglo, saxons, who, had, mostly, converted, from, their, native, anglo, saxon, paganism, around, the, 7th, century, beowulf, thus, depicts, a, germanic, warrior, society, in, which, the, relationship, between, the, lord, of, the, region, and, those, who, served, under, him, was, of, paramount, importance, in, terms, of, the, relationship, between, characters, in, beowulf, to, god, one, might, recall, the, substantial, amount, of, paganism, that, is, present, throughout, the, work, literary, critics, such, as, fred, c, robinson, argue, that, the, beowulf, poet, tries, to, send, a, message, to, readers, during, the, anglo, saxon, time, period, regarding, the, state, of, christianity, in, their, own, time, robinson, argues, that, the, intensified, religious, aspects, of, the, anglo, saxon, period, inherently, shape, the, way, in, which, the, poet, alludes, to, paganism, as, presented, in, beowulf, the, poet, calls, on, anglo, saxon, readers, to, recognize, the, imperfect, aspects, of, their, supposed, christian, lifestyles, in, other, words, the, poet, is, referencing, their, anglo, saxon, heathenism, in, terms, of, the, characters, of, the, epic, itself, robinson, argues, that, readers, are, impressed, by, the, courageous, acts, of, beowulf, and, the, speeches, of, hrothgar, but, one, is, ultimately, left, to, feel, sorry, for, both, men, as, they, are, fully, detached, from, supposed, christian, truth, the, relationship, between, the, characters, of, beowulf, and, the, overall, message, of, the, poet, regarding, their, relationship, with, god, is, debated, among, readers, and, literary, critics, alike, richard, north, argues, that, the, beowulf, poet, interpreted, danish, myths, in, christian, form, as, the, poem, would, have, served, as, a, form, of, entertainment, for, a, christian, audience, and, states, as, yet, we, are, no, closer, to, finding, out, why, the, first, audience, of, beowulf, liked, to, hear, stories, about, people, routinely, classified, as, damned, this, question, is, pressing, given, that, anglo, saxons, saw, the, danes, as, heathens, rather, than, as, foreigners, donaldson, wrote, that, the, poet, who, put, the, materials, into, their, present, form, was, a, christian, and, poem, reflects, a, christian, tradition, other, scholars, disagree, as, to, whether, beowulf, is, a, christian, work, set, in, a, germanic, pagan, context, the, question, suggests, that, the, conversion, from, the, germanic, pagan, beliefs, to, christian, ones, was, a, prolonged, and, gradual, process, over, several, centuries, and, the, poem, s, message, in, respect, to, religious, belief, at, the, time, it, was, written, remains, unclear, robert, f, yeager, describes, the, basis, for, these, questions, that, the, scribes, of, cotton, vitellius, a, xv, were, christian, beyond, doubt, and, it, is, equally, sure, that, beowulf, was, composed, in, a, christianised, england, since, conversion, took, place, in, the, sixth, and, seventh, centuries, the, only, biblical, references, in, beowulf, are, to, the, old, testament, and, christ, is, never, mentioned, the, poem, is, set, in, pagan, times, and, none, of, the, characters, is, demonstrably, christian, in, fact, when, we, are, told, what, anyone, in, the, poem, believes, we, learn, that, they, are, pagans, beowulf, s, own, beliefs, are, not, expressed, explicitly, he, offers, eloquent, prayers, to, a, higher, power, addressing, himself, to, the, father, almighty, or, the, wielder, of, all, were, those, the, prayers, of, a, pagan, who, used, phrases, the, christians, subsequently, appropriated, or, did, the, poem, s, author, intend, to, see, beowulf, as, a, christian, ur, hero, symbolically, refulgent, with, christian, virtues, ursula, schaefer, s, view, is, that, the, poem, was, created, and, is, interpretable, within, both, pagan, and, christian, horizons, schaefer, s, concept, of, vocality, offers,
