details, of, the, history, cultures, genealogies, and, languages, that, tolkien, imagined, for, the, peoples, of, middle, earth, in, antiquarian, style, they, provide, background, details, for, the, narrative, with, much, detail, for, tolkien, fans, who, want, to, know, more, about, the, stories, tolkien, presents, the, lord, of, the, rings, within, a, fictional, frame, story, where, he, is, not, the, original, author, but, merely, the, translator, of, part, of, an, ancient, document, the, red, book, of, westmarch, that, book, is, modelled, on, the, real, red, book, of, hergest, which, similarly, presents, an, older, mythology, various, details, of, the, frame, story, appear, in, the, prologue, its, note, on, shire, records, and, in, the, appendices, notably, appendix, f, in, this, frame, story, the, red, book, is, the, purported, source, of, tolkien, s, other, works, relating, to, middle, earth, the, hobbit, the, silmarillion, and, the, adventures, of, tom, bombadil, although, a, major, work, in, itself, the, lord, of, the, rings, was, only, the, last, movement, of, a, much, older, set, of, narratives, tolkien, had, worked, on, since, 1917, encompassing, the, silmarillion, in, a, process, he, described, as, mythopoeia, the, lord, of, the, rings, started, as, a, sequel, to, tolkien, s, work, the, hobbit, published, in, 1937, the, popularity, of, the, hobbit, led, george, allen, unwin, the, publishers, to, request, a, sequel, tolkien, warned, them, that, he, wrote, quite, slowly, and, responded, with, several, stories, he, had, already, developed, having, rejected, his, contemporary, drafts, for, the, silmarillion, putting, roverandom, on, hold, and, accepting, farmer, giles, of, ham, allen, unwin, continued, to, ask, for, more, stories, about, hobbits, persuaded, by, his, publishers, he, started, a, new, hobbit, in, december, 1937, after, several, false, starts, the, story, of, the, one, ring, emerged, the, idea, for, the, first, chapter, a, long, expected, party, arrived, fully, formed, although, the, reasons, behind, bilbo, s, disappearance, the, significance, of, the, ring, and, the, title, the, lord, of, the, rings, did, not, come, until, the, spring, of, 1938, originally, he, planned, to, write, a, story, in, which, bilbo, had, used, up, all, his, treasure, and, was, looking, for, another, adventure, to, gain, more, however, he, remembered, the, ring, and, its, powers, and, thought, that, would, be, a, better, focus, for, the, new, work, as, the, story, progressed, he, brought, in, elements, from, the, silmarillion, mythology, writing, was, slow, because, tolkien, had, a, full, time, academic, position, marked, exams, to, bring, in, a, little, extra, income, and, wrote, many, drafts, tolkien, abandoned, the, lord, of, the, rings, during, most, of, 1943, and, only, restarted, it, in, april, 1944, as, a, serial, for, his, son, christopher, tolkien, who, was, sent, chapters, as, they, were, written, while, he, was, serving, in, south, africa, with, the, royal, air, force, tolkien, made, another, major, effort, in, 1946, and, showed, the, manuscript, to, his, publishers, in, 1947, the, story, was, effectively, finished, the, next, year, but, tolkien, did, not, complete, the, revision, of, earlier, parts, of, the, work, until, 1949, the, original, manuscripts, which, total, 9, 250, pages, now, reside, in, the, j, r, r, tolkien, collection, at, marquette, university, unusually, for, 20th, century, novels, the, prose, narrative, is, supplemented, throughout, by, over, 60, pieces, of, poetry, these, include, verse, and, songs, of, many, genres, for, wandering, marching, to, war, drinking, and, having, a, bath, narrating, ancient, myths, riddles, prophecies, and, magical, incantations, and, of, praise, and, lament, elegy, some, such, as, riddles, charms, elegies, and, narrating, heroic, actions, are, found, in, old, english, poetry, scholars, have, stated, that, the, poetry, is, essential, for, the, fiction, to, work, aesthetically, and, thematically, as, it, adds, information, not, given, in, the, prose, and, it, brings, out, characters, and, their, backgrounds, the, poetry, has, been, judged, to, be, of, high, technical, skill, reflected, in, tolkien, s, prose, for, instance, he, wrote, much, of, tom, bombadil, s, speech, in, metre, tolkien, worked, on, the, text, using, his, maps, of, middle, earth, as, a, guide, to, ensure, the, elements, of, the, story, fitted, together, in, time, and, space, he, prepared, a, variety, of, types, of, illustration, maps, calligraphy, drawings, cover, designs, even, a, facsimile, painting, of, the, book, of, mazarbul, but, only, the, maps, the, inscription, on, the, ring, and, a, drawing, of, the, doors, of, durin, were, included, in, the, first, edition, the, hardback, editions, sometimes, had, cover, illustrations, by, tolkien, sometimes, by, other, artists, according, to, the, new, york, times, barbara, remington, s, cover, designs, for, ballantine, s, paperback, editions, achieved, mass, cult, status, in, the, 1960s, particularly, on, college, campuses, across, america, tolkien, drew, on, a, wide, array, of, influences, including, language, christianity, mythology, and, germanic, heroic, legend, including, the, norse, v, lsunga, saga, archaeology, especially, at, the, temple, of, nodens, ancient, and, modern, literature, like, finnish, 19th, century, epic, poetry, the, kalevala, by, elias, l, nnrot, and, personal, experience, he, was, inspired, primarily, by, his, profession, philology, his, work, centred, on, the, study, of, old, english, literature, especially, beowulf, and, he, acknowledged, its, importance, to, his, writings, he, was, a, gifted, linguist, influenced, by, celtic, finnish, slavic, and, greek, language, and, mythology, commentators, have, attempted, to, identify, literary, and, topological, antecedents, for, characters, places, and, events, in, tolkien, s, writings, he, acknowledged, that, he, had, enjoyed, adventure, stories, by, authors, such, as, john, buchan, and, rider, haggard, the, arts, and, crafts, polymath, william, morris, was, a, major, influence, and, tolkien, undoubtedly, made, use, of, some, real, place, names, such, as, bag, end, the, name, of, his, aunt, s, home, tolkien, stated, too, that, he, had, been, influenced, by, his, childhood, experiences, of, the, english, countryside, of, worcestershire, near, sarehole, mill, and, its, urbanization, by, the, growth, of, birmingham, and, his, personal, experience, of, fighting, in, the, trenches, of, the, first, world, war, moreover, the, militarization, and, industrialization, inspired, the, character, of, sauron, and, his, forces, the, orcs, represented, the, worst, of, it, as, workers, that, have, been, tortured, and, brutalized, by, the, war, and, industry, scholars, and, critics, have, identified, many, themes, in, the, book, with, its, complex, interlaced, narrative, including, a, reversed, quest, the, struggle, of, good, and, evil, death, and, immortality, fate, and, free, will, the, addictive, danger, of, power, and, various, aspects, of, christianity, such, as, the, presence, of, three, christ, figures, for, prophet, priest, and, king, as, well, as, elements, like, hope, and, redemptive, suffering, there, is, a, common, theme, throughout, the, work, of, language, its, sound, and, its, relationship, to, peoples, and, places, along, with, hints, of, providence, in, descriptions, of, weather, and, landscape, out, of, these, tolkien, stated, that, the, central, theme, is, death, and, immortality, to, those, who, supposed, that, the, book, was, an, allegory, of, events, in, the, 20th, century, tolkien, replied, in, the, foreword, to, the, second, edition, that, it, was, not, saying, he, preferred, history, true, or, feigned, with, its, varied, applicability, to, the, thought, and, experience, of, readers, some, commentators, have, criticized, the, book, for, being, a, story, about, men, for, boys, with, no, significant, women, or, about, a, purely, rural, world, with, no, bearing, on, modern, life, in, cities, of, containing, no, sign, of, religion, or, of, racism, other, commentators, responded, by, noting, that, there, are, three, powerful, women, in, the, book, galadriel, owyn, and, arwen, that, life, even, in, rural, hobbiton, is, not, idealized, that, christianity, is, a, pervasive, theme, and, that, tolkien, was, sharply, anti, racist, both, in, peacetime, and, during, the, second, world, war, while, middle, earth, is, evidently, polycultural, a, dispute, with, his, publisher, george, allen, unwin, led, tolkien, to, offer, the, work, to, william, collins, in, 1950, tolkien, intended, the, silmarillion, itself, largely, unrevised, at, this, point, to, be, published, along, with, the, lord, of, the, rings, but, allen, unwin, were, unwilling, to, do, this, after, milton, waldman, his, contact, at, collins, expressed, the, belief, that, the, lord, of, the, rings, itself, urgently, wanted, cutting, tolkien, eventually, demanded, that, they, publish, the, book, in, 1952, collins, did, not, and, so, tolkien, wrote, to, allen, and, unwin, saying, i, would, gladly, consider, the, publication, of, any, part, of, the, stuff, fearing, his, work, would, never, see, the, light, of, day, for, publication, the, work, was, divided, into, three, volumes, to, minimize, any, potential, financial, loss, due, to, the, high, cost, of, type, setting, and, modest, anticipated, sales, the, fellowship, of, the, ring, books, i, and, ii, the, two, towers, books, iii, and, iv, and, the, return, of, the, king, books, v, and, vi, plus, six, appendices, delays, in, producing, appendices, maps, and, especially, an, index, led, to, the, volumes, being, published, later, than, originally, hoped, on, 29, july, 1954, on, 11, november, 1954, and, on, 20, october, 1955, respectively, in, the,

on, 5, january, 1956, the, return, of, the, king, was, especially, delayed, as, tolkien, revised, the, ending, and, prepared, appendices, some, of, which, had, to, be, left, out, because, of, space, constraints, tolkien, did, not, like, the, title, the, return, of, the, king, believing, it, gave, away, too, much, of, the, storyline, but, deferred, to, his, publisher, s, preference, tolkien, wrote, that, the, title, the, two, towers, can, be, left, ambiguous, but, considered, naming, the, two, as, orthanc, and, barad, d, r, minas, tirith, and, barad, d, r, or, orthanc, and, the, tower, of, cirith, ungol, however, a, month, later, he, wrote, a, note, published, at, the, end, of, the, fellowship, of, the, ring, and, later, drew, a, cover, illustration, both, of, which, identified, the, pair, as, minas, morgul, and, orthanc, tolkien, was, initially, opposed, to, titles, being, given, to, each, two, book, volume, preferring, instead, the, use, of, book, titles, e, g, the, lord, of, the, rings, vol, 1, the, ring, sets, out, and, the, ring, goes, south, vol, 2, the, treason, of, isengard, and, the, ring, goes, east, vol, 3, the, war, of, the, ring, and, the, end, of, the, third, age, however, these, individual, book, titles, were, dropped, and, after, pressure, from, his, publishers, tolkien, suggested, the, volume, titles, vol, 1, the, shadow, grows, vol, 2, the, ring, in, the, shadow, vol, 3, the, war, of, the, ring, or, the, return, of, the, king, because, the, three, volume, binding, was, so, widely, distributed, the, work, is, often, referred, to, as, the, lord, of, the, rings, trilogy, in, a, letter, to, the, poet, w, h, auden, who, famously, reviewed, the, final, volume, in, 1956, tolkien, himself, made, use, of, the, term, trilogy, for, the, work, though, he, did, at, other, times, consider, this, incorrect, as, it, was, written, and, conceived, as, a, single, book, it, is, often, called, a, novel, however, tolkien, objected, to, this, term, as, he, viewed, it, as, a, heroic, romance, the, books, were, published, under, a, profit, sharing, arrangement, whereby, tolkien, would, not, receive, an, advance, or, royalties, until, the, books, had, broken, even, after, which, he, would, take, a, large, share, of, the, profits, it, has, ultimately, become, one, of, the, best, selling, novels, ever, written, with, at, least, 50, million,

by, harpercollins, in, the, early, 1960s, donald, a, wollheim, science, fiction, editor, of, the, paperback, publisher, ace, books, claimed, that, the, lord, of, the, rings, was, not, protected, in, the, united, states, under, american, copyright, law, because, houghton, mifflin, the, us, hardcover, publisher, had, neglected, to, copyright, the, work, in, the, united, states, then, in, 1965, ace, books, proceeded, to, publish, an, edition, unauthorized, by, tolkien, and, without, paying, royalties, to, him, tolkien, took, issue, with, this, and, quickly, notified, his, fans, of, this, objection, grass, roots, pressure, from, these, fans, became, so, great, that, ace, books, withdrew, their, edition, and, made, a, nominal, payment, to, tolkien, authorized, editions, followed, from, ballantine, books, and, houghton, mifflin, to, tremendous, commercial, success, tolkien, undertook, various, textual, revisions, to, produce, a, version, of, the, book, that, would, be, published, with, his, consent, and, establish, an, unquestioned, us, copyright, this, text, became, the, second, edition, of, the, lord, of, the, rings, published, in, 1965, the, first, ballantine, paperback,

wayne, g, hammond, and, christina, scull, under, supervision, from, christopher, tolkien, studied, and, revised, the, text, to, eliminate, as, many, errors, and, inconsistencies, as, possible, some, of, which, had, been, introduced, by, well, meaning, compositors, of, the, first, printing, in, 1954, and, never, been, corrected, the, 2005, edition, of, the, book, contained, further, corrections, noticed, by, the, editors, and, submitted, by, readers, yet, more, corrections, were, made, in, the, 60th, anniversary, edition, in, 2014, several, editions, including, the, 50th, anniversary,

varying, degrees, of, success, into, at, least, 38, and, reportedly, at, least, 70, languages, tolkien, an, expert, in, philology, examined, many, of, these, translations, and, made, comments, on, each, that, reflect, both, the, translation, process, and, his, work, as, he, was, unhappy, with, some, choices, made, by, early, translators, such, as, the, swedish, translation, by, ke, ohlmarks, tolkien, wrote, a, guide, to, the, names, in, the, lord, of, the, rings, 1967, because, the, lord, of, the, rings, purports, to, be, a, translation, of, the, fictitious, red, book, of, westmarch, using, the, english, language, to, represent, the, westron, of, the, original, tolkien, suggested, that, translators, attempt, to, capture, the, interplay, between, english, and, the, invented, nomenclature, of, the, english, work, and, gave, several, examples, along, with, general, guidance, early, reviews, of, the, work, were, mixed, the, initial, review, in, the, sunday, telegraph, described, it, as, among, the, greatest, works, of, imaginative, fiction, of, the, twentieth, century, the, sunday, times, echoed, this, sentiment, stating, that, the, english, speaking, world, is, divided, into, those, who, have, read, the, lord, of, the, rings, and, the, hobbit, and, those, who, are, going, to, read, them, the, new, york, herald, tribune, appeared, to, predict, the, books, popularity, writing, in, its, review, that, they, were, destined, to, outlast, our, time, w, h, auden, a, former, pupil, of, tolkien, s, and, an, admirer, of, his, writings, regarded, the, lord, of, the, rings, as, a, masterpiece, further, stating, that, in, some, cases, it, outdid, the, achievement, of, john, milton, s, paradise, lost, kenneth, f, slater, wrote, in, nebula, science, fiction, april, 1955, if, you, don, t, read, it, you, have, missed, one, of, the, finest, books, of, its, type, ever, to, appear, on, the, other, hand, in, 1955, the, scottish, poet, edwin, muir, attacked, the, return, of, the, king, writing, that, all, the, characters, are, boys, masquerading, as, adult, heroes, and, will, never, come, to, puberty, hardly, one, of, them, knows, anything, about, women, causing, tolkien, to, complain, angrily, to, his, publisher, in, 1956, the, literary, critic, edmund, wilson, wrote, a, review, entitled, oo, those, awful, orcs, calling, tolkien, s, work, juvenile, trash, and, saying, dr, tolkien, has, little, skill, at, narrative, and, no, instinct, for, literary, form, within, tolkien, s, literary, group, the, inklings, the, work, had, a, mixed, reception, hugo, dyson, complained, loudly, at, its, readings, whereas, c, s, lewis, had, very, different, feelings, writing, here, are, beauties, which, pierce, like, swords, or, burn, like, cold, iron, here, is, a, book, which, will, break, your, heart, lewis, observed, that, the, writing, is, rich, in, that, some, of, the, good, characters, have, darker, sides, and, likewise, some, of, the, villains, have, good, impulses, despite, the, mixed, reviews, and, the, lack, of, a, paperback, until, the, 1960s, the, lord, of, the, rings, initially, sold, well, in, hardback, judith, shulevitz, writing, in, the, new, york, times, criticized, the, pedantry, of, tolkien, s, literary, style, saying, that, he, formulated, a, high, minded, belief, in, the, importance, of, his, mission, as, a, literary, preservationist, which, turns, out, to, be, death, to, literature, itself, the, critic, richard, jenkyns, writing, in, the, new, republic, criticized, the, work, for, a, lack, of, psychological, depth, both, the, characters, and, the, work, itself, were, according, to, jenkyns, anemic, and, lacking, in, fibre, the, science, fiction, author, david, brin, interprets, the, work, as, holding,

gulf, between, tolkien, s, supporters, both, popular, and, academic, and, his, literary, detractors, and, attempts, to, explain, in, detail, both, why, the, literary, establishment, disliked, the, lord, of, the, rings, and, the, work, s, subtlety, themes, and, merits, including, the, impression, of, depth, that, it, conveys, the, scholar, of, humanities, brian, rosebury, analysed, tolkien, s, prose, style, in, detail, showing, that, it, was, generally, quite, plain, varying, to, suit, the, voices, of, the, different, characters, and, rising, to, a, heroic, register, for, special, moments,
