long, depression, these, popular, colour, prints, came, to, be, called, nishiki, e, or, brocade, pictures, as, their, brilliant, colours, seemed, to, bear, resemblance, to, imported, chinese,

that, of, the, artist, the, delicate, romantic, prints, of, suzuki, harunobu, 1725, 1770, were, amongst, the, first, to, realize, expressive, and, complex, colour, designs, printed, with, up, to, a, dozen, separate, blocks, to, handle, the, different, colours, and, half, tones, his, restrained, graceful, prints, invoked, the, classicism, of, waka, poetry, and, yamato, e, painting, the, prolific, harunobu, was, the, dominant, ukiyo, e, artist, of, his, time, the, success, of, harunobu, s, colourful, nishiki, e, from, 1765, on, led, to, a, steep, decline, in, demand, for, the, limited, palettes, of, benizuri, e, and, urushi, e, as, well, as, hand, coloured, prints, a, trend, against, the, idealism, of, the, prints, of, harunobu, and, the, torii, school, grew, following, harunobu, s, death, in, 1770, katsukawa, shunsh, 1726, 1793, and, his, school, produced, portraits, of, kabuki, actors, with, greater, fidelity, to, the, actors, actual, features, than, had, been, the, trend, sometime, collaborators, kory, sai, 1735, c, 1790, and, kitao, shigemasa, 1739, 1820, were, prominent, depicters, of, women, who, also, moved, ukiyo, e, away, from, the, dominance, of, harunobu, s, idealism, by, focusing, on, contemporary, urban, fashions, and, celebrated, real, world, courtesans, and, geisha, kory, sai, was, perhaps, the, most, prolific, ukiyo, e, artist, of, the, 18th, century, and, produced, a, larger, number, of, paintings, and, print, series, than, any, predecessor, the, kitao, school, that, shigemasa, founded, was, one, of, the, dominant, schools, of, the, closing, decades, of, the, 18th, century, in, the, 1770s, utagawa, toyoharu, produced, a, number, of, uki, e, perspective, prints, that, demonstrated, a, mastery, of, western, perspective, techniques, that, had, eluded, his, predecessors, in, the, genre, toyoharu, s, works, helped, pioneer, the, landscape, as, an, ukiyo, e, subject, rather, than, merely, a, background, for, human, figures, in, the, 19th, century, western, style, perspective, techniques, were, absorbed, into, japanese, artistic, culture, and, deployed, in, the, refined, landscapes, of, such, artists, as, hokusai, and, hiroshige, the, latter, a, member, of, the, utagawa, school, that, toyoharu, founded, this, school, was, to, become, one, of, the, most, influential, and, produced, works, in, a, far, greater, variety, of, genres, than, any, other, school, while, the, late, 18th, century, saw, hard, economic, times, ukiyo, e, saw, a, peak, in, quantity, and, quality, of, works, particularly, during, the, kansei, era, 1789, 1791, the, ukiyo, e, of, the, period, of, the, kansei, reforms, brought, about, a, focus, on, beauty, and, harmony, that, collapsed, into, decadence, and, disharmony, in, the, next, century, as, the, reforms, broke, down, and, tensions, rose, culminating, in, the, meiji, restoration, of, 1868, especially, in, the, 1780s, torii, kiyonaga, 1752, 1815, of, the, torii, school, depicted, traditional, ukiyo, e, subjects, like, beauties, and, urban, scenes, which, he, printed, on, large, sheets, of, paper, often, as, multiprint, horizontal, diptychs, or, triptychs, his, works, dispensed, with, the, poetic, dreamscapes, made, by, harunobu, opting, instead, for, realistic, depictions, of, idealized, female, forms, dressed, in, the, latest, fashions, and, posed, in, scenic, locations, he, also, produced, portraits, of, kabuki, actors, in, a, realistic, style, that, included, accompanying, musicians, and, chorus, a, law, went, into, effect, in, 1790, requiring, prints, to, bear, a, censor, s, seal, of, approval, to, be, sold, censorship, increased, in, strictness, over, the, following, decades, and, violators, could, receive, harsh, punishments, from, 1799, even,

printing, techniques, to, bring, out, subtle, differences, in, the, features, expressions, and, backdrops, of, subjects, from, a, wide, variety, of, class, and, background, utamaro, s, individuated, beauties, were, in, sharp, contrast, to, the, stereotyped, idealized, images, that, had, been, the, norm, by, the, end, of, the, decade, especially, following, the, death, of, his, patron, tsutaya, j, zabur, in, 1797, utamaro, s, prodigious, output, declined, in, quality, and, he, died, in, 1806, appearing, suddenly, in, 1794, and, disappearing, just, as, suddenly, ten, months, later, the, prints, of, the, enigmatic, sharaku, are, amongst, ukiyo, e, s, best, known, sharaku, produced, striking, portraits, of, kabuki, actors, introducing, a, greater, level, of, realism, into, his, prints, that, emphasized, the, differences, between, the, actor, and, the, portrayed, character, the, expressive, contorted, faces, he, depicted, contrasted, sharply, with, the, serene, mask, like, faces, more, common, to, artists, such, as, harunobu, or, utamaro, published, by, tsutaya, sharaku, s, work, found, resistance, and, in, 1795, his, output, ceased, as, mysteriously, as, it, had, appeared, his,

his, portraits, of, graceful, slender, courtesans, and, left, behind, a, number, of, noted, students, with, a, fine, line, eish, sai, ch, ki, fl, 1786, 1808, designed, portraits, of, delicate, courtesans, the, utagawa, school, came, to, dominate, ukiyo, e, output, in, the, late, edo, period, edo, was, the, primary, centre, of, ukiyo, e, production, throughout, the, edo, period, another, major, centre, developed, in, the, kamigata, region, of, areas, in, and, around, kyoto, and, osaka, in, contrast, to, the, range, of, subjects, in, the, edo, prints, those, of, kamigata, tended, to, be, portraits, of, kabuki, actors, the, style, of, the, kamigata, prints, was, little, distinguished, from, those, of, edo, until, the, late, 18th, century, partly, because, artists, often, moved, back, and, forth, between, the, two, areas, colours, tend, to, be, softer, and, pigments, thicker, in, kamigata, prints, than, in, those, of, edo, in, the, 19th, century, many, of, the, prints, were, designed, by, kabuki, fans, and, other, amateurs, the, tenp, reforms, of, 1841, 1843, sought, to, suppress, outward, displays, of, luxury, including, the, depiction, of, courtesans, and, actors, as, a, result, many, ukiyo, e, artists, designed, travel, scenes, and, pictures, of, nature, especially, birds, and, flowers, landscapes, had, been, given, limited, attention, since, moronobu, and, they, formed, an, important, element, in, the, works, of, kiyonaga, and, shunch, it, was, not, until, late, in, the, edo, period, that, landscape, came, into, its, own, as, a, genre, especially, via, the, works, of, hokusai, and, hiroshige, the, landscape, genre, has, come, to, dominate, western, perceptions, of, ukiyo, e, though, ukiyo, e, had, a, long, history, preceding, these, late, era, masters, the, japanese, landscape, differed, from, the, western, tradition, in, that, it, relied, more, heavily, on, imagination, composition, and, atmosphere, than, on, strict, observance, of, nature, the, self, proclaimed, mad, painter, hokusai, 1760, 1849, enjoyed, a, long, varied, career, his, work, is, marked, by, a, lack, of, the, sentimentality, common, to, ukiyo, e, and, a, focus, on, formalism, influenced, by, western, art, among, his, accomplishments, are, his, illustrations, of, takizawa, bakin, s, novel, crescent, moon, his, series, of, sketchbooks, the, hokusai, manga, and, his, popularization, of, the, landscape, genre, with, thirty, six, views, of, mount, fuji, which, includes, his, best, known, print, the, great, wave, off, kanagawa, one, of, the, most, famous, works, of, japanese, art, in, contrast, to, the, work, of, the, older, masters, hokusai, s, colours, were, bold, flat, and, abstract, and, his, subject, was, not, the, pleasure, districts, but, the, lives, and,

period, the, prolific, kunisada, 1786, 1865, had, few, rivals, in, the, tradition, of, making, portrait, prints, of, courtesans, and, actors, one, of, those, rivals, was, eisen, 1790, 1848, who, was, also, adept, at, landscapes, perhaps, the, last, significant, member, of, this, late, period, kuniyoshi, 1797, 1861, tried, his, hand, at, a, variety, of, themes, and, styles, much, as, hokusai, had, his, historical, scenes, of, warriors, in, violent, combat, were, popular, especially, his, series, of, heroes, from, the, suikoden, 1827, 1830, and, ch, shingura, 1847, he, was, adept, at, landscapes, and, satirical, scenes, the, latter, an, area, rarely, explored, in, the, dictatorial, atmosphere, of, the, edo, period, that, kuniyoshia, could, dare, tackle, such, subjects, was, a, sign, of, the, weakening, of, the, shogunate, at, the, time, hiroshige, 1797, 1858, is, considered, hokusai, s, greatest, rival, in, stature, he, specialized, in, pictures, of, birds, and, flowers, and, serene, landscapes, and, is, best, known, for, his, travel, series, such, as, the, fifty, three, stations, of, the, t, kaid, and, the, sixty, nine, stations, of, the, kisokaid, the, latter, a,

rapid, westernization, of, the, meiji, period, that, followed, saw, woodblock, printing, turn, its, services, to, journalism, and, face, competition, from, photography, practitioners, of, pure, ukiyo, e, became, more, rare, and, tastes, turned, away, from, a, genre, seen, as, a, remnant, of, an, obsolescent, era, artists, continued, to, produce, occasional, notable, works, but, by, the, 1890s, the, tradition, was, moribund, synthetic, pigments, imported, from, germany, began, to, replace, traditional, organic, ones, in, the, mid, 19th, century, many, prints, from, this, era, made, extensive, use, of, a, bright, red, and, were, called, aka, e, red, pictures, artists, such, as, yoshitoshi, 1839, 1892, led, a, trend, in, the, 1860s, of, gruesome, scenes, of, murders, and, ghosts, monsters, and, supernatural, beings, and, legendary, japanese, and, chinese, heroes, his, one, hundred, aspects, of, the, moon, 1885, 1892, depicts, a, variety, of, fantastic, and, mundane, themes, with, a,

a, year, in, the, dutch, trading, settlement, dejima, near, nagasaki, and, was, one, of, the, earliest, westerners, to, collect, japanese, prints, the, export, of, ukiyo, e, thereafter, slowly, grew, and, at, the, beginning, of, the, 19th, century, dutch, merchant, trader, isaac, titsingh, s, collection, drew, the, attention, of, connoisseurs, of, art, in, paris, the, arrival, in, edo, of,

prints, were, amongst, the, items, he, brought, back, to, the, united, states, such, prints, had, appeared, in, paris, from, at, least, the, 1830s, and, by, the, 1850s, were, numerous, reception, was, mixed, and, even, when, praised, ukiyo, e, was, generally, thought, inferior, to, western, works, which, emphasized, mastery, of, naturalistic, perspective, and, anatomy, japanese, art, drew, notice, at, the, international, exhibition, of, 1867, in, paris, and, became, fashionable, in, france, and, england, in, the, 1870s, and, 1880s, the, prints, of, hokusai, and, hiroshige, played, a, prominent, role, in, shaping, western, perceptions, of, japanese, art, at, the, time, of, their, introduction, to, the, west, woodblock, printing, was, the, most, common, mass, medium, in, japan, and, the, japanese, considered, it, of, little, lasting, value, early, europeans, promoters, and, scholars, of, ukiyo, e, and, japanese, art, included, writer, edmond, de, goncourt, and, art, critic, philippe,

prints, tadamasa, hayashi, was, a, prominent, paris, based, dealer, of, respected, tastes, whose, tokyo, office, was, responsible, for, evaluating, and, exporting, large, quantities, of, ukiyo, e, prints, to, the, west, in, such, quantities, that, japanese, critics, later, accused, him, of, siphoning, japan, of, its, national, treasure, the, drain, first, went, unnoticed, in, japan, as, japanese, artists, were, immersing, themselves, in, the, classical, painting, techniques, of, the, west, japanese, art, and, particularly, ukiyo, e, prints, came, to, influence, western, art, from, the, time, of, the, early, impressionists, early, painter, collectors, incorporated, japanese, themes, and, compositional, techniques, into, their, works, as, early, as, the, 1860s, the, patterned,

much, of, this, work, with, his, initials, in, a, circle, imitating, the, seals, on, japanese, prints, other, artists, of, the, time, who, drew, influence, from, ukiyo, e, include, monet, la, farge, gauguin, and, les, nabis, members, such, as, bonnard, and, vuillard, french, composer, claude, debussy, drew, inspiration, for, his, music, from, the, prints, of, hokusai, and, hiroshige, most,

within, japan, to, have, citizens, better, know, their, country, in, 1915, publisher, sh, zabur, watanabe, introduced, the, term, shin, hanga, new, prints, to, describe, a, style, of, prints, he, published, that, featured, traditional, japanese, subject, matter, and, were, aimed, at, foreign, and, upscale, japanese, audiences, prominent, artists, included, goy, hashiguchi, called, the, utamaro, of, the, taish, period, for, his, manner, of, depicting, women, shinsui, it, who, brought, more, modern, sensibilities, to, images, of, women, and, hasui, kawase, who, made, modern, landscapes, watanabe, also, published, works, by, non, japanese, artists, an, early, success, of, which, was, a, set, of, indian, and, japanese, themed, prints, in, 1916, by, the, english, charles, w, bartlett, 1860, 1940, other, publishers, followed, watanabe, s, success, and, some, shin, hanga, artists, such, as, goy, and, hiroshi, yoshida, set, up, studios, to, publish, their, own, work, artists, of, the, s, saku, hanga, creative, prints, movement, took, control, of, every, aspect, of, the, printmaking, process, design, carving, and, printing, were, by, the, same, pair, of, hands, kanae, yamamoto, 1882, 1946, then, a, student, at, the, tokyo, school, of, fine, arts, is, credited, with, the, birth, of, this, approach, in, 1904, he, produced, fisherman, using, woodblock, printing, a, technique, until, then, frowned, upon, by, the, japanese, art, establishment, as, old, fashioned, and, for, its, association, with, commercial, mass, production, the, foundation, of, the, japanese, woodcut, artists, association, in, 1918, marks, the, beginning, of, this, approach, as, a, movement, the, movement, favoured, individuality, in, its, artists, and, as, such, has, no, dominant, themes, or, styles, works, ranged, from, the, entirely, abstract, ones, of, k, shir, onchi, 1891, 1955, to, the, traditional, figurative, depictions, of, japanese, scenes, of, un, ichi, hiratsuka, 1895, 1997, these, artists, produced, prints, not, because, they, hoped, to, reach, a, mass, audience, but, as, a, creative, end, in, itself, and, did, not, restrict, their, print, media, to, the, woodblock, of, traditional, ukiyo, e, prints, from, the, late, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, have, evolved, from, the, concerns, of, earlier, movements, especially, the, s, saku, hanga, movement, s, emphasis, on, individual, expression, screen, printing, etching, mezzotint, mixed, media, and, other, western, methods, have, joined, traditional, woodcutting, amongst, printmakers, techniques, early, ukiyo, e, artists, brought, with, them, a, sophisticated, knowledge, of, and, training, in, the, composition, principles, of, classical, chinese, painting, gradually, these, artists, shed, the, overt, chinese, influence, to, develop, a, native, japanese, idiom, the, early, ukiyo, e, artists, have, been, called, primitives, in, the, sense, that, the, print, medium, was, a, new, challenge, to, which, they, adapted, these, centuries, old, techniques, their, image, designs, are, not, considered, primitive, many, ukiyo, e, artists, received, training, from, teachers, of, the, kan, and, other, painterly, schools, a, defining, feature, of, most, ukiyo, e, prints, is, a, well, defined, bold, flat, line, the, earliest, prints, were, monochromatic, and, these, lines, were, the, only, printed, element, even, with, the, advent, of, colour, this, characteristic, line, continued, to, dominate, in, ukiyo, e, composition, forms, are, arranged, in, flat, spaces, with, figures, typically, in, a, single, plane, of, depth, attention, was, drawn, to, vertical, and, horizontal, relationships, as, well, as, details, such, as, lines, shapes, and, patterns, such, as, those, on, clothing, compositions, were, often, asymmetrical, and, the, viewpoint, was, often, from, unusual, angles, such, as, from, above, elements, of, images, were, often, cropped, giving, the, composition, a, spontaneous, feel, in, colour, prints, contours, of, most, colour, areas, are, sharply, defined, usually, by, the, linework, the, aesthetic, of, flat, areas, of, colour, contrasts, with, the, modulated, colours, expected, in, western, traditions, and, with, other, prominent, contemporary, traditions, in, japanese, art, patronized, by, the, upper, class, such, as, in, the, subtle, monochrome, ink, brushstrokes, of, zenga, brush, painting, or, tonal, colours, of, the, kan, school, of, painting, the, colourful, ostentatious, and, complex, patterns, concern, with, changing, fashions, and, tense, dynamic, poses, and, compositions, in, ukiyo, e, are, in, striking, contrast, with, many, concepts, in, traditional, japanese, aesthetics, prominent, amongst, these, wabi, sabi, favours, simplicity, asymmetry, and, imperfection, with, evidence, of, the, passage, of, time, and, shibui, values, subtlety, humility, and, restraint, ukiyo, e, can, be, less, at, odds, with, aesthetic, concepts, such, as, the, racy, urbane, stylishness, of, iki, ukiyo, e, displays, an, unusual, approach, to, graphical, perspective, one, that, can, appear, underdeveloped, when, compared, to, european, paintings, of, the, same, period, western, style, geometrical, perspective, was, known, in, japan, practised, most, prominently, by, the, akita, ranga, painters, of, the, 1770s, as, were, chinese, methods, to, create, a, sense, of, depth, using, a, homogeny, of, parallel, lines, the, techniques, sometimes, appeared, together, in, ukiyo, e, works, geometrical, perspective, providing, an, illusion, of, depth, in, the, background, and, the, more, expressive, chinese, perspective, in, the, fore, the, techniques, were, most, likely, learned, at, first, through, chinese, western, style, paintings, rather, than, directly, from, western, works, long, after, becoming, familiar, with, these, techniques, artists, continued, to, harmonize, them, with, traditional, methods, according, to, their, compositional, and, expressive, needs, other, ways, of, indicating, depth, included, the, chinese, tripartite, composition, method, used, in, buddhist, pictures, where, a, large, form, is, placed, in, the, foreground, a, smaller, in, the, midground, and, yet, a, smaller, in, the, background, this, can, be, seen, in, hokusai, s, great, wave, with, a, large, boat, in, the, foreground, a, smaller, behind, it, and, a, small, mt, fuji, behind, them, there, was, a, tendency, since, early, ukiyo, e, to, pose, beauties, in, what, art, historian, midori, wakakura, called, a, serpentine, posture, which, involves, the, subjects, bodies, twisting, unnaturally, while, facing, behind, themselves, art, historian, motoaki, k, no, posited, that, this, had, its, roots, in, traditional, buy, dance, haruo, suwa, countered, that, the, poses, were, artistic, licence, taken, by, ukiyo, e, artists, causing, a, seemingly, relaxed, pose, to, reach, unnatural, or, impossible, physical, extremes, this, remained, the, case, even, when, realistic, perspective, techniques, were, applied, to, other, sections, of, the, composition, typical, subjects, were, female, beauties, bijin, ga, kabuki, actors, yakusha, e, and, landscapes, the, women, depicted, were, most, often, courtesans, and, geisha, at, leisure, and, promoted, the, entertainments, to, be, found, in, the, pleasure, districts, the, detail, with, which, artists, depicted, courtesans, fashions, and, hairstyles, allows, the, prints, to, be, dated, with, some, reliability, less, attention, was, given, to, accuracy, of, the, women, s, physical, features, which, followed, the, day, s, pictorial, fashions, the, faces, stereotyped, the, bodies, tall, and, lanky, in, one, generation, and, petite, in, another, portraits, of, celebrities, were, much, in, demand, in, particular, those, from, the, kabuki, and, sumo, worlds, two, of, the, most, popular, entertainments, of, the, era, while, the, landscape, has, come, to, define, ukiyo, e, for, many, westerners, landscapes, flourished, relatively, late, in, the, ukiyo, e, s, history, ukiyo, e, prints, grew, out, of, book, illustration, many, of, moronobu, s, earliest, single, page, prints, were, originally, pages, from, books, he, had, illustrated, e, hon, books, of, illustrations, were, popular, and, continued, be, an, important, outlet, for, ukiyo, e, artists, in, the, late, period, hokusai, produced, the, three, volume, one, hundred, views, of, mount, fuji, and, the, 15, volume, hokusai, manga, the, latter, a, compendium, of, over, 4000, sketches, of, a, wide, variety, of, realistic, and, fantastic, subjects, traditional, japanese, religions, do, not, consider, sex, or, pornography, a, moral, corruption, in, the, sense, of, most, abrahamic, faiths, and, until, the, changing, morals, of, the, meiji, era, led, to, its, suppression, shunga, erotic, prints, were, a, major, genre, while, the, tokugawa, regime, subjected, japan, to, strict, censorship, laws, pornography, was, not, considered, an, important, offence, and, generally, met, with, the, censors, approval, many, of, these, prints, displayed, a, high, level, a, draughtsmanship, and, often, humour, in, their, explicit, depictions, of, bedroom, scenes, voyeurs, and, oversized, anatomy, as, with, depictions, of, courtesans, these, images, were, closely, tied, to, entertainments, of, the, pleasure, quarters, nearly, every, ukiyo, e, master, produced, shunga, at, some, point, records, of, societal, acceptance, of, shunga, are, absent, though, timon, screech, posits, that, there, were, almost, certainly, some, concerns, over, the, matter, and, that, its, level, of, acceptability, has, been, exaggerated, by, later, collectors, especially, in, the, west, scenes, from, nature, have, been, an, important, part, of, asian, art, throughout, history, artists, have, closely, studied, the, correct, forms, and, anatomy, of, plants, and, animals, even, though, depictions, of, human, anatomy, remained, more, fanciful, until, modern, times, ukiyo, e, nature, prints, are, called, kach, e, which, translates, as, flower, and, bird, pictures, though, the, genre, was, open, to, more, than, just, flowers, or, birds, and, the, flowers, and, birds, did, not, necessarily, appear, together, hokusai, s, detailed, precise, nature, prints, are, credited, with, establishing, kach, e, as, a, genre, the, tenp, reforms, of, the, 1840s, suppressed, the, depiction, of, actors, and, courtesans, aside, from, landscapes, and, kach, e, artists, turned, to,
