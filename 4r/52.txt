surface, decoration, while, never, a, cathedral, sagrada, fam, lia, was, planned, from, the, outset, to, be, a, large, building, comparable, in, size, to, a, cathedral, its, ground, plan, has, obvious, links, to, earlier, spanish, cathedrals, such, as, burgos, cathedral, le, n, cathedral, and, seville, cathedral, in, common, with, catalan, and, many, other, european, gothic, cathedrals,

passion, fa, ade, to, the, west, and, the, glory, fa, ade, to, the, south, incomplete, the, nativity, fa, ade, was, built, before, work, was, interrupted, in, 1935, and, bears, the, most, direct, gaud, influence, the, passion, fa, ade, was, built, according, to, the, design, that, gaudi, created, in, 1917, the, construction, began, in, 1954, and, the, steeples, built, over, the, elliptical, plan, were, finished, in, 1976, it, is, especially, striking, for, its, spare, gaunt, tormented, characters, including, emaciated, figures, of, christ, being, scourged, at, the, pillar, and, christ, on, the, cross, these, controversial, designs, are, the, work, of, josep, maria, subirachs, the, glory, fa, ade, on, which, construction, began, in, 2002, will, be, the, largest, and, most, monumental, of, the, three, and, will, represent, one, s, ascension, to, god, it, will, also, depict, various, scenes, such, as, hell, purgatory, and, will, include, elements, such, as, the, seven, deadly, sins, and, the, seven, heavenly, virtues, constructed, between, 1893, and, 1936, the, nativity, fa, ade, was, the, first, fa, ade, to, be, completed, dedicated, to, the, birth, of, jesus, it, is, decorated, with, scenes, reminiscent, of, elements, of, life, characteristic, of, gaud, s, naturalistic, style, the, sculptures, are, ornately, arranged, and, decorated, with, scenes, and, images, from, nature, each, a, symbol, in, its, own, manner, for, instance, the, three, porticos, are, separated, by, two, large, columns, and, at, the, base, of, each, lies, a, turtle, or, a, tortoise, one, to, represent, the, land, and, the, other, the, sea, each, are, symbols, of, time, as, something, set, in, stone, and, unchangeable, in, contrast, to, the, figures, of, turtles, and, their, symbolism, two, chameleons, can, be, found, at, either, side, of, the, fa, ade, and, are, symbolic, of, change, the, fa, ade, faces, the, rising, sun, to, the, northeast, a, symbol, for, the, birth, of, christ, it, is, divided, into, three, porticos, each, of, which, represents, a, theological, virtue, hope, faith, and, charity, the, tree, of, life, rises, above, the, door, of, jesus, in, the, portico, of, charity, four, steeples, complete, the, fa, ade, and, are, each, dedicated, to, a, saint, matthias, barnabas, jude, the, apostle, and, simon, the, zealot, originally, gaud, intended, for, this, fa, ade, to, be, polychromed, for, each, archivolt, to, be, painted, with, a, wide, array, of, colours, he, wanted, every, statue, and, figure, to, be, painted, in, this, way, the, figures, of, humans, would, appear, as, much, alive, as, the, figures, of, plants, and, animals, gaud, chose, this, fa, ade, to, embody, the, structure, and, decoration, of, the, whole, church, he, was, well, aware, that, he, would, not, finish, the, church, and, that, he, would, need, to, set, an, artistic, and, architectural, example, for, others, to, follow, he, also, chose, for, this, fa, ade, to, be, the, first, on, which, to, begin, construction, and, for, it, to, be, in, his, opinion, the, most, attractive, and, accessible, to, the, public, he, believed, that, if, he, had, begun, construction, with, the, passion, fa, ade, one, that, would, be, hard, and, bare, as, if, made, of, bones, before, the, nativity, fa, ade, people, would, have, withdrawn, at, the, sight, of, it, some, of, the, statues, were, destroyed, in, 1936, during, the, spanish, civil, war, and, subsequently, were, reconstructed, by, the, japanese, artist, etsuro, sotoo, in, contrast, to, the, highly, decorated, nativity, fa, ade, the, passion, fa, ade, is, austere, plain, and, simple, with, ample, bare, stone, and, is, carved, with, harsh, straight, lines, to, resemble, the, bones, of, a, skeleton, dedicated, to, the, passion, of, christ, the, suffering, of, jesus, during, his, crucifixion, the, fa, ade, was, intended, to, portray, the, sins, of, man, construction, began, in, 1954, following, the, drawings, and, instructions, left, by, gaud, for, future, architects, and, sculptors, the, steeples, were, completed, in, 1976, and, in, 1987, a, team, of, sculptors, headed, by, josep, maria, subirachs, began, work, sculpting, the, various, scenes, and, details, of, the, fa, ade, they, aimed, to, give, a, rigid, angular, form, to, provoke, a, dramatic, effect, gaud, intended, for, this, fa, ade, to, strike, fear, into, the, onlooker, he, wanted, to, break, arcs, and, cut, columns, and, to, use, the, effect, of, chiaroscuro, dark, angular, shadows, contrasted, by, harsh, rigid, light, to, further, show, the, severity, and, brutality, of, christ, s, sacrifice, facing, the, setting, sun, indicative, and, symbolic, of, the, death, of, christ, the, passion, fa, ade, is, supported, by, six, large, and, inclined, columns, designed, to, resemble, strained, muscles, above, there, is, a, pyramidal, pediment, made, up, of, eighteen, bone, shaped, columns, which, culminate, in, a, large, cross, with, a, crown, of, thorns, each, of, the, four, steeples, is, dedicated, to, an, apostle, james, thomas, philip, and, bartholomew, and, like, the, nativity, fa, ade, there, are, three, porticos, each, representing, the, theological, virtues, though, in, a, much, different, light, the, scenes, sculpted, into, the, fa, ade, may, be, divided, into, three, levels, which, ascend, in, an, s, form, and, reproduce, the, stations, of, the, cross, via, crucis, of, christ, the, lowest, level, depicts, scenes, from, jesus, last, night, before, the, crucifixion, including, the, last, supper, kiss, of, judas, ecce, homo, and, the, sanhedrin, trial, of, jesus, the, middle, level, portrays, the, calvary, or, golgotha, of, christ, and, includes, the, three, marys, saint, longinus, saint, veronica, and, a, hollow, face, illusion, of, christ, on, the, veil, of, veronica, in, the, third, and, final, level, the, death, burial, and, the, resurrection, of, christ, can, be, seen, a, bronze, figure, situated, on, a, bridge, creating, a, link, between, the, steeples, of, saint, bartholomew, and, saint, thomas, represents, the, ascension, of, jesus, the, fa, ade, contains, a, magic, square, based, on, the, magic, square, in, the, 1514, print, melencolia, i, the, square, is, rotated, and, one, number, in, each, row, and, column, is, reduced, by, one, so, the, rows, and, columns, add, up, to, 33, instead, of, the, standard, 34, for, a, 4x4, magic, square, the, largest, and, most, striking, of, the, fa, ades, will, be, the, glory, fa, ade, on, which, construction, began, in, 2002, it, will, be, the, principal, fa, ade, and, will, offer, access, to, the, central, nave, dedicated, to, the, celestial, glory, of, jesus, it, represents, the, road, to, god, death, final, judgment, and, glory, while, hell, is, left, for, those, who, deviate, from, god, s, will, aware, that, he, would, not, live, long, enough, to, see, this, fa, ade, completed, gaud, made, a, model, which, was, demolished, in, 1936, whose, original, fragments, were, used, as, the, basis, for, the, development, of, the, design, for, the, fa, ade, the, completion, of, this, fa, ade, may, require, the, partial, demolition, of, the, block, with, buildings, across, the, carrer, de, mallorca, the, decision, was, expected, to, be, proposed, in, may, 2023, to, reach, the, glory, portico, the, large, staircase, will, lead, over, the, underground, passage, built, over, carrer, de, mallorca, with, the, decoration, representing, hell, and, vice, on, other, projects, carrer, de, mallorca, will, have, to, go, underground,

will, have, seven, large, columns, dedicated, to, gifts, of, the, holy, spirit, at, the, base, of, the, columns, there, will, be, representations, of, the, seven, deadly, sins, and, at, the, top, the, seven, heavenly, virtues, this, fa, ade, will, have, five, doors, corresponding, to, the, five, naves, of, the, temple, with, the, central, one, having, a, triple, entrance, that, will, give, the, glory, fa, ade, a, total, seven, doors, representing, the, sacraments, in, september, 2008, the, doors, of, the, glory, fa, ade, by, subirachs, were, installed, these, central, doors, bear, the, text,

adhere, to, the, grid, requiring, a, section, of, columns, of, the, ambulatory, to, transition, to, the, grid, thus, creating, a, horseshoe, pattern, to, the, layout, of, those, columns, the, crossing, rests, on, the, four, central, columns, of, porphyry, supporting, a, great, hyperboloid, surrounded, by, two, rings, of, twelve, hyperboloids, currently, under, construction, the, central,
