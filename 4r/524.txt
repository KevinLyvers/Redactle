persian, art, or, iranian, art, persian, romanized, honar, ir, ni, has, one, of, the, richest, art, heritages, in, world, history, and, has, been, strong, in, many, media, including, architecture, painting, weaving, pottery, calligraphy, metalworking, and, sculpture, at, different, times, influences, from, the, art, of, neighbouring, civilizations, have, been, very, important, and, latterly, persian, art, gave, and, received, major, influences, as, part, of, the, wider, styles, of, islamic, art, this, article, covers, the, art, of, persia, up, to, 1925, and, the, end, of, the, qajar, dynasty, for, later, art, see, iranian, modern, and, contemporary, art, and, for, traditional, crafts, see, arts, of, iran, rock, art, in, iran, is, its, most, ancient, surviving, art, iranian, architecture, is, covered, at, that, article, from, the, achaemenid, empire, of, 550, bc, 330, bc, for, most, of, the, time, a, large, iranian, speaking, state, has, ruled, over, areas, similar, to, the, modern, boundaries, of, iran, and, often, much, wider, areas, sometimes, called, greater, iran, where, a, process, of, cultural, persianization, left, enduring, results, even, when, rulership, separated, the, courts, of, successive, dynasties, have, generally, led, the, style, of, persian, art, and, court, sponsored, art, has, left, many, of, the, most, impressive, survivals, in, ancient, times, the, surviving, monuments, of, persian, art, are, notable, for, a, tradition, concentrating, on, the, human, figure, mostly, male, and, often, royal, and, animals, persian, art, continued, to, place, larger, emphasis, on, figures, than, islamic, art, from, other, areas, though, for, religious, reasons, now, generally, avoiding, large, examples, especially, in, sculpture, the, general, islamic, style, of, dense, decoration, geometrically, laid, out, developed, in, persia, into, a, supremely, elegant, and, harmonious, style, combining, motifs, derived, from, plants, with, chinese, motifs, such, as, the, cloud, band, and, often, animals, that, are, represented, at, a, much, smaller, scale, than, the, plant, elements, surrounding, them, under, the, safavid, dynasty, in, the, 16th, century, this, style, was, used, across, a, wide, variety, of, media, and, diffused, from, the, court, artists, of, the, shah, most, being, mainly, painters, evidence, of, a, painted, pottery, civilization, around, susa, has, been, dated, to, c, 5000, bce, susa, was, firmly, within, the, sumerian, uruk, cultural, sphere, during, the, uruk, period, an, imitation, of, the, entire, state, apparatus, of, uruk, proto, writing, cylinder, seals, with, sumerian, motifs, and, monumental, architecture, is, found, at, susa, susa, may, have, been, a, colony, of, uruk, as, such, the, periodization, of, susa, corresponds, to, uruk, early, middle, and, late, susa, ii, periods, 3800, 3100, bce, correspond, to, early, middle, and, late, uruk, periods, shortly, after, susa, was, first, settled, 6000, years, ago, its, inhabitants, erected, a, temple, on, a, monumental, platform, that, rose, over, the, flat, surrounding, landscape, the, exceptional, nature, of, the, site, is, still, recognizable, today, in, the, artistry, of, the, ceramic, vessels, that, were, placed, as, offerings, in, a, thousand, or, more, graves, near, the, base, of, the, temple, platform, nearly, two, thousand, pots, were, recovered, from, the, cemetery, most, of, them, now, in, the, louvre, the, vessels, found, are, eloquent, testimony, to, the, artistic, and, technical, achievements, of, their, makers, and, they, hold, clues, about, the, organization, of, the, society, that, commissioned, them, painted, ceramic, vessels, from, susa, in, the, earliest, first, style, are, a, late, regional, version, of, the, mesopotamian, ubaid, ceramic, tradition, that, spread, across, the, near, east, during, the, fifth, millennium, b, c, susa, i, style, was, very, much, a, product, of, the, past, and, of, influences, from, contemporary, ceramic, industries, in, the, mountains, of, western, iran, the, recurrence, in, close, association, of, vessels, of, three, types, a, drinking, goblet, or, beaker, a, serving, dish, and, a, small, jar, implies, the, consumption, of, three, types, of, food, apparently, thought, to, be, as, necessary, for, life, in, the, afterworld, as, it, is, in, this, one, ceramics, of, these, shapes, which, were, painted, constitute, a, large, proportion, of, the, vessels, from, the, cemetery, others, are, course, cooking, type, jars, and, bowls, with, simple, bands, painted, on, them, and, were, probably, the, grave, goods, of, the, sites, of, humbler, citizens, as, well, as, adolescents, and, perhaps, children, the, pottery, is, carefully, made, by, hand, although, a, slow, wheel, may, have, been, employed, the, asymmetry, of, the, vessels, and, the, irregularity, of, the, drawing, of, encircling, lines, and, bands, indicate, that, most, of, the, work, was, done, freehand, the, rock, reliefs, of, the, mountain, kingdom, of, lullubi, especially, the, anubanini, rock, relief, are, rock, reliefs, from, circa, 2300, bc, or, the, early, 2nd, millennium, bc, the, earliest, rock, reliefs, of, iran, they, are, located, in, kermanshah, province, these, reliefs, are, thought, to, have, influenced, the, later, achaemenid, behistun, reliefs, about, a, millennium, and, a, half, later, elamite, art, from, the, south, and, west, of, modern, iran, shared, many, characteristics, with, the, neighbouring, art, of, mesopotamia, though, it, was, often, less, sophisticated, cylinder, seals, small, figures, of, worshippers, gods, and, animals, shallow, reliefs, and, some, large, statues, of, rulers, are, all, found, there, are, a, small, number, of, very, fine, gold, vessels, with, relief, figures, luristan, bronzes, rarely, lorest, n, lorest, ni, etc, in, sources, in, english, are, small, cast, objects, decorated, with, bronze, sculptures, from, the, early, iron, age, which, have, been, found, in, large, numbers, in, lorest, n, province, and, kermanshah, in, west, central, iran, they, include, a, great, number, of, ornaments, tools, weapons, horse, fittings, and, a, smaller, number, of, vessels, including, situlae, and, those, found, in, recorded, excavations, are, generally, found, in, burials, the, ethnicity, of, the, people, who, created, them, remains, unclear, though, they, may, well, have, been, persian, possibly, related, to, the, modern, lur, people, who, have, given, their, name, to, the, area, they, probably, date, to, between, about, 1000, and, 650, bc, the, bronzes, tend, to, be, flat, and, use, openwork, like, the, related, metalwork, of, scythian, art, they, represent, the, art, of, a, nomadic, or, transhumant, people, for, whom, all, possessions, needed, to, be, light, and, portable, and, necessary, objects, such, as, weapons, finials, perhaps, for, tent, poles, horse, harness, fittings, pins, cups, and, small, fittings, are, highly, decorated, over, their, small, surface, area, representations, of, animals, are, common, especially, goats, or, sheep, with, large, horns, and, the, forms, and, styles, are, distinctive, and, inventive, the, master, of, animals, motif, showing, a, human, positioned, between, and, grasping, two, confronted, animals, is, common, but, typically, highly, stylized, some, female, mistress, of, animals, are, seen, the, ziwiye, hoard, of, about, 700, bc, is, a, collection, of, objects, mostly, in, metal, perhaps, not, all, in, fact, found, together, of, about, the, same, date, probably, showing, the, art, of, the, persian, cities, of, the, period, delicate, metalwork, from, iron, age, ii, times, has, been, found, at, hasanlu, and, still, earlier, at, marlik, achaemenid, art, includes, frieze, reliefs, metalwork, decoration, of, palaces, glazed, brick, masonry, fine, craftsmanship, masonry, carpentry, etc, and, gardening, most, survivals, of, court, art, are, monumental, sculpture, above, all, the, reliefs, double, animal, headed, persian, column, capitals, and, other, sculptures, of, persepolis, see, below, for, the, few, but, impressive, achaemenid, rock, reliefs, although, the, persians, took, artists, with, their, styles, and, techniques, from, all, corners, of, their, empire, they, produced, not, simply, a, combination, of, styles, but, a, synthesis, of, a, new, unique, persian, style, cyrus, the, great, in, fact, had, an, extensive, ancient, iranian, heritage, behind, him, the, rich, achaemenid, gold, work, which, inscriptions, suggest, may, have, been, a, specialty, of, the, medes, was, for, instance, in, the, tradition, of, earlier, sites, the, rhyton, drinking, vessel, horn, shaped, and, usually, ending, in, an, animal, shape, is, the, most, common, type, of, large, metalwork, to, survive, as, in, a, fine, example, in, new, york, there, are, a, number, of, very, fine, smaller, pieces, of, jewellery, or, inlay, in, precious, metal, also, mostly, featuring, animals, and, the, oxus, treasure, has, a, wide, selection, of, types, small, pieces, typically, in, gold, were, sewn, to, clothing, by, the, elite, and, a, number, of, gold, torcs, have, survived, the, large, carved, rock, relief, typically, placed, high, beside, a, road, and, near, a, source, of, water, is, a, common, medium, in, persian, art, mostly, used, to, glorify, the, king, and, proclaim, persian, control, over, territory, it, begins, with, lullubi, and, elamite, rock, reliefs, such, as, those, at, sarpol, e, zahab, circa, 2000, bc, kul, e, farah, and, eshkaft, e, salman, in, southwest, iran, and, continues, under, the, assyrians, the, behistun, relief, and, inscription, made, around, 500, bc, for, darius, the, great, is, on, a, far, grander, scale, reflecting, and, proclaiming, the, power, of, the, achaemenid, empire, persian, rulers, commonly, boasted, of, their, power, and, achievements, until, the, muslim, conquest, removed, imagery, from, such, monuments, much, later, there, was, a, small, revival, under, the, qajar, dynasty, behistun, is, unusual, in, having, a, large, and, important, inscription, which, like, the, egyptian, rosetta, stone, repeats, its, text, in, three, different, languages, here, all, using, cuneiform, script, old, persian, elamite, and, babylonian, a, later, form, of, akkadian, this, was, important, in, the, modern, understanding, of, these, languages, other, persian, reliefs, generally, lack, inscriptions, and, the, kings, involved, often, can, only, be, tentatively, identified, the, problem, is, helped, in, the, case, of, the, sasanians, by, their, custom, of, showing, a, different, style, of, crown, for, each, king, which, can, be, identified, from, their, coins, naqsh, e, rustam, is, the, necropolis, of, the, achaemenid, dynasty, 500, 330, bc, with, four, large, tombs, cut, high, into, the, cliff, face, these, have, mainly, architectural, decoration, but, the, facades, include, large, panels, over, the, doorways, each, very, similar, in, content, with, figures, of, the, king, being, invested, by, a, god, above, a, zone, with, rows, of, smaller, figures, bearing, tribute, with, soldiers, and, officials, the, three, classes, of, figures, are, sharply, differentiated, in, size, the, entrance, to, each, tomb, is, at, the, centre, of, each, cross, which, opens, onto, a, small, chamber, where, the, king, lay, in, a, sarcophagus, the, horizontal, beam, of, each, of, the, tomb, s, facades, is, believed, to, be, a, replica, of, the, entrance, of, the, palace, at, persepolis, only, one, has, inscriptions, and, the, matching, of, the, other, kings, to, tombs, is, somewhat, speculative, the, relief, figures, are, not, intended, as, individualized, portraits, the, third, from, the, left, identified, by, an, inscription, is, the, tomb, of, darius, i, the, great, c, 522, 486, bc, the, other, three, are, believed, to, be, those, of, xerxes, i, c, 486, 465, bc, artaxerxes, i, c, 465, 424, bc, and, darius, ii, c, 423, 404, bc, respectively, a, fifth, unfinished, one, might, be, that, of, artaxerxes, iii, who, reigned, at, the, longest, two, years, but, is, more, likely, that, of, darius, iii, c, 336, 330, bc, last, of, the, achaemenid, dynasts, the, tombs, were, looted, following, the, conquest, of, the, achaemenid, empire, by, alexander, the, great, well, below, the, achaemenid, tombs, near, ground, level, are, rock, reliefs, with, large, figures, of, sassanian, kings, some, meeting, gods, others, in, combat, the, most, famous, shows, the, sassanian, king, shapur, i, on, horseback, with, the, roman, emperor, valerian, bowing, to, him, in, submission, and, philip, the, arab, an, earlier, emperor, who, paid, shapur, tribute, holding, shapur, s, horse, while, the, dead, emperor, gordian, iii, killed, in, battle, lies, beneath, it, other, identifications, have, been, suggested, this, commemorates, the, battle, of, edessa, in, 260, ad, when, valerian, became, the, only, roman, emperor, who, was, captured, as, a, prisoner, of, war, a, lasting, humiliation, for, the, romans, the, placing, of, these, reliefs, clearly, suggests, the, sasanian, intention, to, link, themselves, with, the, glories, of, the, earlier, achaemenid, empire, there, are, three, further, achaemenid, royal, tombs, with, similar, reliefs, at, persepolis, one, unfinished, the, seven, sassanian, reliefs, whose, approximate, dates, range, from, 225, to, 310, ad, show, subjects, including, investiture, scenes, and, battles, the, earliest, relief, at, the, site, is, elamite, from, about, 1000, bc, about, a, kilometre, away, is, naqsh, e, rajab, with, a, further, four, sasanian, rock, reliefs, three, celebrating, kings, and, one, a, high, priest, another, important, sasanian, site, is, taq, bostan, with, several, reliefs, including, two, royal, investitures, and, a, famous, figure, of, a, cataphract, or, persian, heavy, cavalryman, about, twice, life, size, probably, representing, the, king, khosrow, parviz, mounted, on, his, favourite, horse, shabdiz, the, pair, continued, to, be, celebrated, in, later, persian, literature, firuzabad, fars, and, bishapur, have, groups, of, sassanian, reliefs, the, former, including, the, oldest, a, large, battle, scene, now, badly, worn, at, barm, e, delak, a, king, offers, a, flower, to, his, queen, sassanian, reliefs, are, concentrated, in, the, first, 80, years, of, the, dynasty, though, one, important, set, are, 6th, century, and, at, relatively, few, sites, mostly, in, the, sasanian, heartland, the, later, ones, in, particular, suggest, that, they, draw, on, a, now, lost, tradition, of, similar, reliefs, in, palaces, in, stucco, the, rock, reliefs, were, probably, coated, in, plaster, and, painted, the, rock, reliefs, of, the, preceding, persian, selucids, and, parthians, are, generally, smaller, and, more, crude, and, not, all, direct, royal, commissions, as, the, sasanian, ones, clearly, were, at, behistun, an, earlier, relief, including, a, lion, was, adapted, into, a, reclining, herakles, in, a, fully, hellenistic, style, he, reclines, on, a, lion, skin, this, was, only, uncovered, below, rubble, relatively, recently, an, inscription, dates, it, to, 148, bc, other, reliefs, in, iran, include, the, assyrian, king, in, shallow, relief, at, shikaft, e, gulgul, not, all, sites, with, persian, reliefs, are, in, modern, iran, like, other, sassanian, styles, the, form, enjoyed, a, small, revival, under, the, qajar, whose, reliefs, include, a, large, and, lively, panel, showing, hunting, at, the, royal, hunting, ground, of, tangeh, savashi, and, a, panel, still, largely, with, its, colouring, intact, at, taq, bostan, showing, the, shah, seated, with, attendants, the, standard, catalogue, of, pre, islamic, persian, reliefs, lists, the, known, examples, as, at, 1984, as, follows, lullubi, 1, 4, elam, 5, 19, assyrian, 20, 21, achaemenid, 22, 30, late, post, achaemenid, and, seleucid, 31, 35, parthian, 36, 49, sasanian, 50, 84, others, 85, 88, the, art, of, the, parthians, was, a, mix, of, iranian, and, hellenistic, styles, the, parthian, empire, existed, from, 247, bc, to, 224, ad, in, what, is, now, greater, iran, and, several, territories, outside, it, parthian, places, are, often, overlooked, in, excavations, and, parthian, layers, difficult, to, distinguish, from, those, around, them, the, research, situation, and, the, state, of, knowledge, on, parthian, art, is, therefore, still, very, patchy, dating, is, difficult, and, the, most, important, remains, come, from, the, fringes, of, the, empire, as, at, hatra, in, modern, iraq, which, has, produced, the, largest, quantity, of, parthian, sculpture, yet, excavated, even, after, the, period, of, the, parthian, dynasty, art, in, its, style, continued, in, surrounding, areas, for, some, time, even, in, narrative, representations, figures, look, frontally, out, to, the, viewer, rather, than, at, each, other, a, feature, that, anticipates, the, art, of, late, antiquity, medieval, europe, and, byzantium, great, attention, is, paid, to, the, details, of, clothing, which, in, full, length, figures, is, shown, decorated, with, elaborate, designs, probably, embroidered, including, large, figures, the, excavations, at, dura, europos, in, the, 20th, century, provided, many, new, discoveries, the, classical, archaeologist, and, director, of, the, excavations, michael, rostovtzeff, realized, that, the, art, of, the, first, centuries, ad, palmyra, dura, europos, but, also, in, iran, up, to, the, buddhist, india, followed, the, same, principles, he, called, this, artwork, parthian, art, the, most, characteristic, feature, of, the, parthian, art, is, frontality, which, is, not, a, special, feature, of, iranic, or, parthian, art, and, first, appeared, in, the, art, of, palmyra, there, are, doubts, whether, this, art, can, be, called, a, parthian, art, or, that, it, should, be, associated, with, any, particular, regional, area, there, is, no, evidence, that, this, art, was, created, outside, the, middle, euphrates, region, then, brought, to, palmyra, for, example, this, art, is, better, thought, of, as, a, local, development, common, to, the, middle, euphrates, region, parthian, rock, reliefs, are, covered, above, in, architecture, patterns, in, plaster, were, very, popular, almost, all, now, lost, once, the, technique, was, developed, these, covered, large, surfaces, and, perhaps, shared, elements, of, their, design, with, carpets, and, other, textiles, also, now, almost, entirely, lost, parthian, rhyta, continued, the, achaemenid, style, but, in, the, best, the, animals, at, the, terminal, or, protome, are, more, naturalistic, probably, under, greek, influence, sasanian, art, was, produced, under, the, sasanian, empire, which, ruled, from, the, 3rd, to, 7th, centuries, ad, before, the, muslim, conquest, of, persia, was, completed, around, 651, in, 224, ad, the, last, parthian, king, was, defeated, by, ardashir, i, the, resulting, sasanian, dynasty, would, last, for, four, hundred, years, ruling, modern, iran, iraq, and, much, territory, to, the, east, and, north, of, modern, iran, at, times, the, levant, much, of, anatolia, and, parts, of, egypt, and, arabia, were, under, its, control, it, began, a, new, era, in, iran, and, mesopotamia, which, in, many, ways, was, built, on, achaemenid, traditions, including, the, art, of, the, period, nevertheless, there, were, also, other, influences, on, art, of, the, period, that, came, from, as, far, as, china, and, the, mediterranean, the, surviving, art, of, the, sasanians, is, best, seen, in, its, architecture, reliefs, and, metalwork, and, there, are, some, surviving, paintings, from, what, was, evidently, a, widespread, production, stone, reliefs, were, probably, greatly, outnumbered, by, interior, ones, in, plaster, of, which, only, fragments, have, survived, free, standing, sculptures, faded, out, of, popularity, in, this, time, as, compared, to, the, period, under, the, parthians, but, the, colossal, statue, of, shapur, i, r, ad, 240, 272, is, a, major, exception, carved, from, a, stalagmite, grown, in, a, cave, there, are, literary, mentions, of, other, colossal, statues, of, kings, now, lost, the, important, sasanian, rock, reliefs, are, covered, above, and, the, parthian, tradition, of, moulded, stucco, decoration, to, buildings, continued, also, including, large, figurative, scenes, surviving, sasanian, art, depicts, courtly, and, chivalric, scenes, with, considerable, grandeur, of, style, reflecting, the, lavish, life, and, display, of, the, sasanian, court, as, recorded, by, byzantine, ambassadors, images, of, rulers, dominate, many, of, the, surviving, works, though, none, are, as, large, as, the, colossal, statue, of, shapur, i, hunting, and, battle, scenes, enjoyed, a, special, popularity, and, lightly, clothed, dancing, girls, and, entertainers, representations, are, often, arranged, like, a, coat, of, arms, which, in, turn, may, have, had, a, strong, influence, on, the, production, of, art, in, europe, and, east, asia, although, parthian, art, preferred, the, front, view, the, narrative, representations, of, the, sassanian, art, often, features, figures, shown, in, the, profile, or, a, three, quarter, view, frontal, views, occur, less, frequently, one, of, the, few, sites, where, wall, paintings, survived, in, quantity, is, panjakent, in, modern, tajikistan, and, ancient, sogdia, which, was, barely, if, at, all, under, the, control, of, the, central, sasanian, power, the, old, city, was, abandoned, in, the, decades, after, the, muslims, eventually, took, the, city, in, 722, and, has, been, extensively, excavated, in, modern, times, large, areas, of, wall, paintings, survived, from, the, palace, and, private, houses, which, are, mostly, now, in, the, hermitage, museum, or, tashkent, they, covered, whole, rooms, and, were, accompanied, by, large, quantities, of, reliefs, in, wood, the, subjects, are, similar, to, other, sasanian, art, with, enthroned, kings, feasts, battles, and, beautiful, women, and, there, are, illustrations, of, both, persian, and, indian, epics, as, well, as, a, complex, mixture, of, deities, they, mostly, date, from, the, 7th, and, 8th, centuries, at, bishapur, floor, mosaics, in, a, broadly, greco, roman, style, have, survived, and, these, were, probably, widespread, in, other, elite, settings, perhaps, made, by, craftsmen, from, the, greek, world, a, number, of, sasanid, silver, vessels, have, survived, especially, rather, large, plates, or, bowls, used, to, serve, food, these, have, high, quality, engraved, or, embossed, decoration, from, a, courtly, repertoire, of, mounted, kings, or, heroes, and, scenes, of, hunting, combat, and, feasting, often, partially, gilded, ewers, presumably, for, wine, may, feature, dancing, girls, in, relief, these, were, exported, to, china, and, also, westwards, sasanian, glass, continued, and, developed, roman, glass, technology, in, simpler, forms, it, seems, to, have, been, available, to, a, wide, range, of, the, population, and, was, a, popular, luxury, export, to, byzantium, and, china, even, appearing, in, elite, burials, from, the, period, in, japan, technically, it, is, a, silica, soda, lime, glass, production, characterized, by, thick, glass, blown, vessels, relatively, sober, in, decoration, avoiding, plain, colours, in, favour, of, transparency, and, with, vessels, worked, in, one, piece, without, over, elaborate, amendments, thus, the, decoration, usually, consists, of, solid, and, visual, motifs, from, the, mould, reliefs, with, ribbed, and, deeply, cut, facets, although, other, techniques, like, trailing, and, applied, motifs, were, practised, sasanian, pottery, does, not, seem, to, have, been, used, by, the, elites, and, is, mostly, utilitarian, carpets, evidently, could, reach, a, high, level, of, sophistication, as, the, praise, lavished, on, the, lost, royal, baharestan, carpet, by, the, muslim, conquerors, shows, but, the, only, surviving, fragments, that, might, originate, from, sasanid, persia, are, humbler, productions, probably, made, by, nomad, tribes, sasanid, textiles, were, famous, and, fragments, have, survived, mostly, with, designs, based, on, animals, in, compartments, in, a, long, lasting, style, sogdian, art, refers, to, the, art, architecture, and, art, forms, produced, by, the, sogdians, an, iranian, people, who, lived, mostly, in, sogdia, in, central, asia, but, also, had, a, large, diaspora, spread, throughout, asia, especially, in, china, where, their, art, was, much, appreciated, and, influenced, the, chinese, this, influence, on, the, chinese, ranged, from, metallurgy, to, music, today, the, sogdians, are, best, known, for, their, paintings, but, they, had, a, distinctive, sculpture, and, architecture, as, well, the, sogdians, were, especially, talented, in, metalworking, and, their, work, in, this, field, inspired, the, chinese, who, were, among, their, patrons, together, with, the, turks, the, sogdian, metalwork, may, be, confused, with, sasanian, metalwork, and, the, two, are, still, confused, by, some, scholars, today, however, they, differentiate, in, technique, and, shape, as, well, as, iconography, thanks, to, the, work, of, archaeologist, boris, marshak, several, characteristic, of, sogdian, metalwork, have, been, established, with, respect, to, sasanian, vessels, sogdian, productions, are, less, massive, their, shape, differs, from, the, sasanian, as, do, the, techniques, employed, in, their, production, further, the, designs, of, sogdian, productions, are, more, dynamic, the, sogdians, lived, in, architecturally, complex, abodes, that, resembled, their, temples, these, places, were, decorated, with, remarkable, paintings, an, art, in, which, the, sogdians, excelled, indeed, they, preferred, to, produce, paintings, and, wood, carvings, to, decorate, their, own, houses, sogdian, wall, paintings, are, bright, vigorous, and, of, remarkable, beauty, but, also, tell, about, sogdian, life, they, reproduce, for, example, the, costumes, of, the, day, the, gaming, equipment, and, the, harness, they, also, depict, stories, and, epics, drawing, on, iranian, near, eastern, manichaean, nestorian, and, indian, themes, sogdian, religious, art, reflects, the, religious, affiliations, of, the, sogdians, and, this, knowledge, is, derived, mostly, from, paintings, and, ossuaries, through, these, artifacts, it, is, possible, to, experience, the, vibrancy, of, sogdian, life, and, imagination, because, sogdian, artists, and, patrons, were, much, attentive, to, social, life, displaying, it, in, their, works, banqueting, hunting, and, entertainment, are, recurrent, in, their, representations, the, sogdians, were, storytellers, they, loved, to, recount, stories, thus, their, paintings, are, narrative, in, nature, the, sogdians, sought, to, portray, both, the, supernatural, and, natural, worlds, this, desire, extended, into, portraying, their, own, world, however, they, did, not, represent, their, mercantile, activities, a, major, source, of, their, wealth, but, instead, chose, to, show, their, enjoyment, of, it, such, as, the, scenes, of, banqueting, at, panjikent, in, these, paintings, we, see, how, the, sogdians, saw, themselves, many, sogdian, paintings, were, destroyed, during, the, several, invasions, they, suffered, in, their, land, of, the, works, which, survived, some, of, the, best, known, are, the, afrasiab, murals, and, the, penjikent, murals, persia, managed, to, retain, its, cultural, identity, after, the, muslim, conquest, of, persia, which, was, complete, by, 654, and, the, arab, conquerors, soon, gave, up, attempts, to, impose, the, arabic, language, on, the, population, although, it, became, the, language, used, by, scholars, turkic, peoples, became, increasingly, important, in, greater, iran, especially, the, eastern, parts, leading, to, a, cultural,

could, be, seen, by, the, whole, population, with, other, types, essentially, restricted, to, the, private, spheres, of, the, rich, carpets, are, recorded, in, several, accounts, of, life, at, the, time, but, none, remain, they, were, perhaps, mainly, a, rural, folk, art, at, this, period, very, highly, decorated, metalwork, in, copper, alloys, brass, or, bronze, was, produced, apparently, for, a, sophisticated, urban, market, gold, and, silver, equivalents, apparently, existed, but, have, been, mostly, recycled, for, their, precious, materials, the, few, survivals, were, mostly, traded, north, for, furs, and, then, buried, as, grave, goods, in, siberia, sasanid, iconography, of, mounted, heroes, hunting, scenes, and, seated, rulers, with, attendants, remained, popular, in, pottery, and, metalwork, now, often, surrounded, by, elaborate, geometrical, and, calligraphic, decoration, the, rich, silk, textiles, that, were, an, important, export, from, persia, also, continued, to, use, the, animal, and, sometimes, human, figures, of, their, sasanid, predecessors, the, samanid, period, saw, the, creation, of, epigraphic, pottery, these, pieces, were, typically, earthenware, vessels, with, black, slip, lettering, in, kufi, script, painted, on, a, base, of, white, slip, these, vessels, would, typically, be, inscribed, with, blessings, or, proverbs, and, used, to, serve, food, samarqand, and, nishapur, were, both, centres, of, production, for, this, kind, of, pottery, the, seljuqs, nomads, of, turkic, origin, from, present, day, mongolia, appeared, on, the, stage, of, islamic, history, toward, the, end, of, the, 10th, century, they, seized, baghdad, in, 1048, before, dying, out, in, 1194, in, iran, although, the, production, of, seljuq, works, continued, through, the, end, of, the, 12th, and, beginning, of, the, 13th, century, under, the, auspices, of, smaller, independent, sovereigns, and, patrons, during, their, time, the, center, of, culture, politics, and,

lower, ranking, officials, would, receive, often, mention, in, inscriptions, on, mosques, meanwhile, growth, in, mass, market, production, and, sale, of, art, made, it, more, commonplace, and, accessible, to, merchants, and, professionals, because, of, increased, production, many, relics, have, survived, from, the, seljuk, era, and, can, be, easily, dated, in, contrast, the, dating, of, earlier, works, is, more, ambiguous, it, is, therefore, easy, to, mistake, seljuk, art, as, new, developments, rather, than, inheritance, from, classical, iranian, and, turkic, sources, innovations, in, ceramics, from, this, period, include, the, production, of, mina, i, ware, painted, in, enamels, with, figures, on, a, white, background, this, is, the, earliest, pottery, anywhere, to, use,

developed, under, these, little, khans, who, were, originally, subservient, to, the, yuan, emperor, but, rapidly, became, independent, architectural, activity, intensified, as, the, mongols, became, sedentary, and, retained, traces, of, their, nomadic, origins, such, as, the, north, south, orientation, of, the, buildings, at, the, same, time, a, process, of, iranisation, took, place, and, construction, according, to, previously, established, types, such, as, the, iranian, plan, mosques, was, resumed, the, art, of, the, persian, book, was, also, born, under, this, dynasty, and, was, encouraged, by, aristocratic, patronage, of, large, manuscripts, such, as, the, jami, al, tawarikh, compiled, by, rashid, al, din, hamadani, and, the, demotte, or, great, mongol, shahnameh, probably, commissioned, by, his, son, new, techniques, in, ceramics, appeared, such, as, the, lajvardina, a, variation, on, lusterware, and, chinese, influence, is, perceptible, in, all, arts, during, the,

intermarried, with, the, persians, and, turks, of, central, asia, even, adopting, their, religion, and, languages, yet, their, simple, control, of, the, world, at, that, time, particularly, in, the, 13, 15th, centuries, reflected, itself, in, the, idealised, appearance, of, persians, as, mongols, though, the, ethnic, make, up, gradually, blended, into, the, iranian, and, mesopotamian, local, populations, the, mongol, stylism, continued, well, after, and, crossed, into, asia, minor, and, even, north, africa, carpet, weaving, is, an, essential, part, of, persian, culture, and, art, within, the, group, of, oriental, rugs, produced, by, the, countries, of, the, so, called, rug, belt, the, persian, carpet, stands, out, by, the, variety, and, elaborateness, of, its, designs, persian, carpets, and, rugs, of, various, types, were, woven, in, parallel, by, nomadic, tribes, in, village, and, town, workshops, and, by, royal, court, manufactories, alike, as, such, they, represent, different, simultaneous, lines, of, tradition, and, reflect, the, history, of, iran, and, its, various, peoples, the, carpets, woven, in, the, safavid, court, manufactories, of, isfahan, during, the, sixteenth, century, are, famous, for, their, elaborate, colours, and, artistical, design, and, are, treasured, in, museums, and, private, collections, all, over, the, world, today, their, patterns, and, designs, have, set, an, artistic, tradition, for, court, manufactories, which, was, kept, alive, during, the, entire, duration, of, the, persian, empire, up, to, the, last, royal, dynasty, of, iran, exceptional, individual, safavid, carpets, include, the, ardabil, carpet, now, in, london, and, los, angeles, and, the, coronation, carpet, now, in, copenhagen, much, earlier, the, baharestan, carpet, is, a, lost, sasanian, carpet, for, the, royal, palace, at, ctesiphon, and, the, oldest, significant, carpet, the, pazyryk, carpet, was, possibly, made, in, persia, carpets, woven, in, towns, and, regional, centres, like, tabriz, kerman, mashhad, kashan, isfahan, nain, and, qom, are, characterized, by, their, specific, weaving, techniques, and, use, of, high, quality, materials, colours, and, patterns, town, manufactories, like, those, of, tabriz, have, played, an, important, historical, role, in, reviving, the, tradition, of, carpet, weaving, after, periods, of, decline, rugs, woven, by, the, villages, and, various, tribes, of, iran, are, distinguished, by, their, fine, wool, bright, and, elaborate, colours, and, specific, traditional, patterns, nomadic, and, small, village, weavers, often, produce, rugs, with, bolder, and, sometimes, more, coarse, designs, which, are, considered, as, the, most, authentic, and, traditional, rugs, of, persia, as, opposed, to, the, artistic, pre, planned, designs, of, the, larger, workplaces, gabbeh, rugs, are, the, best, known, type, of, carpet, from, this, line, of, tradition, the, art, and, craft, of, carpet, weaving, has, gone, through, periods, of, decline, during, times, of, political, unrest, or, under, the, influence, of, commercial, demands, it, particularly, suffered, from, the, introduction, of, synthetic, dyes, during, the, second, half, of, the, nineteenth, century, carpet, weaving, still, plays, a, major, part, in, the, economy, of, modern, iran, modern, production, is, characterized, by, the, revival, of, traditional, dyeing, with, natural, dyes, the, reintroduction, of, traditional, tribal, patterns, but, also, by, the, invention, of, modern, and, innovative, designs, woven, in, the, centuries, old, technique, hand, woven, persian, carpets, and, rugs, were, regarded, as, objects, of, high, artistic, and, utilitarian, value, and, prestige, from, the, first, time, they, were, mentioned, by, ancient, greek, writers, until, today, although, the, term, persian, carpet, most, often, refers, to, pile, woven, textiles, flat, woven, carpets, and, rugs, like, kilim, soumak, and, embroidered, fabrics, like, suzani, are, part, of, the, rich, and, manifold, tradition, of, persian, weaving, persia, was, famous, for, its, textiles, at, least, as, early, as, for, its, carpets, in, 2010, the, traditional, skills, of, carpet, weaving, in, f, rs, and, kashan, were, inscribed, to, the, unesco, intangible, cultural, heritage, lists, a, persian, miniature, is, a, small, painting, on, paper, whether, a, book, illustration, or, a, separate, work, of, art, intended, to, be, kept, in, an, album, of, such, works, called, a, muraqqa, the, techniques, are, broadly, comparable, to, the, western, and, byzantine, traditions, of, miniatures, in, illuminated, manuscripts, although, there, is, an, older, persian, tradition, of, wall, painting, the, survival, rate, and, state, of, preservation, of, miniatures, is, better, and, miniatures, are, much, the, best, known, form, of, persian, painting, in, the, west, and, many, of, the, most, important, examples, are, in, western, or, turkish, museums, miniature, painting, became, a, significant, persian, genre, in, the, 13th, century, receiving, chinese, influence, after, the, mongol, conquests, and, the, highest, point, in, the, tradition, was, reached, in, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, the, tradition, continued, under, some, western, influence, after, this, and, has, many, modern, exponents, the, persian, miniature, was, the, dominant, influence, on, other, islamic, miniature, traditions, principally, the, ottoman, miniature, in, turkey, and, the, mughal, miniature, in, the, indian, sub, continent, the, tradition, grew, from, book, illustration, illustrating, many, narrative, scenes, often, with, many, figures, the, representational, conventions, that, developed, are, effective, but, different, from, western, graphical, perspective, more, important, figures, may, be, somewhat, larger, than, those, around, them, and, battle, scenes, can, be, very, crowded, indeed, recession, depth, in, the, picture, space, is, indicated, by, placing, more, distant, figures, higher, up, in, the, space, great, attention, is, paid, to, the, background, whether, of, a, landscape, or, buildings, and, the, detail, and, freshness, with, which, plants, and, animals, the, fabrics, of, tents, hangings, or, carpets, or, tile, patterns, are, shown, is, one, of, the, great, attractions, of, the, form, the, dress, of, figures, is, equally, shown, with, great, care, although, artists, understandably, often, avoid, depicting, the, patterned, cloth, that, many, would, have, worn, animals, especially, the, horses, that, very, often, appear, are, mostly, shown, sideways, on, even, the, love, stories, that, constitute, much, of, the, classic, material, illustrated, are, conducted, largely, in, the, saddle, as, far, as, the, prince, protagonist, is, concerned, landscapes, are, very, often, mountainous, the, plains, that, make, up, much, of, persia, are, rarely, attempted, this, being, indicated, by, a, high, undulating, horizon, and, outcrops, of, bare, rock, which, like, the, clouds, in, the, normally, small, area, of, sky, left, above, the, landscape, are, depicted, in, conventions, derived, from, chinese, art, even, when, a, scene, in, a, palace, is, shown, the, viewpoint, often, appears, to, be, from, a, point, some, metres, in, the, air, persian, art, under, islam, had, never, completely, forbidden, the, human, figure, and, in, the, miniature, tradition, the, depiction, of, figures, often, in, large, numbers, is, central, this, was, partly, because, the, miniature, is, a, private, form, kept, in, a, book, or, album, and, only, shown, to, those, the, owner, chooses, it, was, therefore, possible, to, be, more, free, than, in, wall, paintings, or, other, works, seen, by, a, wider, audience, the, qur, an, and, other, purely, religious, works, are, not, known, to, have, been, illustrated, in, this, way, though, histories, and, other, works, of, literature, may, include, religiously, related, scenes, including, those, depicting, muhammed, after, 1500, usually, without, showing, his, face, as, well, as, the, figurative, scenes, in, miniatures, and, borders, there, was, a, parallel, style, of, non, figurative, ornamental, decoration, which, was, found, in, borders, and, panels, in, miniature, pages, and, spaces, at, the, start, or, end, of, a, work, or, section, and, often, in, whole, pages, acting, as, frontispieces, in, islamic, art, this, is, referred, to, as, illumination, and, manuscripts, of, the, qur, an, and, other, religious, books, often, included, considerable, number, of, illuminated, pages, the, designs, reflected, contemporary, work, in, other, media, in, later, periods, being, especially, close, to, book, covers, and, persian, carpets, and, it, is, thought, that, many, carpet, designs, were, created, by, court, artists, and, sent, to, the, workshops, in, the, provinces, safavid, art, is, the, art, of, the, persian, safavid, dynasty, from, 1501, to, 1722, it, was, a, high, point, for, the, art, of, the, book, and, architecture, and, also, including, ceramics, metal, glass, and, gardens, the, arts, of, the, safavid, period, show, a, far, more, unitary, development, than, in, any, other, period, of, persian, art, with, the, same, style, diffused, from, the, court, appearing, in, carpets, architectural, tiles, ceramics, and, manuscript, illumination, when, the, safavids, seized, the, throne, persian, art, had, become, divided, into, two, styles, in, the, east, a, continuation, of, timurid, styles, and, in, the, west, a, turkman, style, two, rulers, of, the, new, dynasty, succeeded, in, encouraging, new, styles, that, spread, all, over, their, territories, shah, tahmasp, i, who, reigned, 1524, 1576, but, lost, interest, in, art, after, about, 1555, and, shah, abbas, i, r, 1588, 1629, chinese, imitation, drawings, emerged, in, 15th, century, persian, art, scholars, have, noted, that, extant, works, from, the, post, mongol, period, contain, an, abundance, of, motifs, common, to, chinese, art, like, dragons, simurgh, cloud, bands, gnarled, tree, trunks, and, lotus, and, peony, flowers, chinoiserie, was, popular, during, this, period, themes, that, had, become, standard, in, persian, art, by, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, included, hunting, scenes, landscapes, featuring, animals, and, horsemen, battling, lions, literary, scenes, depicting, animal, fables, and, dragons, also, featured, in, the, artwork, of, this, period, scholars, have, not, found, evidence, of, persian, drawing, before, the, mongol, invasions, but, hunting, combat, between, men, and, animals, and, animal, fables, are, believed, to, be, persian, or, central, asian, themes, under, the, safavids, the, art, of, the, book, especially, persian, miniature, painting, constituted, the, essential, driving, force, of, the, arts, the, ketab, khaneh, the, royal, library, workshop, provided, most, of, the, sources, of, motifs, for, objects, such, as, carpets, ceramics, or, metal, various, types, of, books, were, copied, illuminated, bound, and, sometimes, illustrated, religious, books, korans, but, also, commentaries, on, the, sacred, text, and, theological, works, and, books, of, persian, literature, the, shahnameh, nizami, s, khamsa, jami, al, tawarikh, by, rashid, al, din, hamadani, and, shorter, accounts, of, the, mi, raj, or, night,

appeared, which, however, rapidly, disappeared, again, the, bindings, were, mostly, in, tinted, morocco, leather, of, very, fine, quality, they, could, be, gilded, and, stamped, with, geometric, floral, or, figurative, motifs, or, embossed, in, blue, in, the, second, half, of, the, 16th, century, they, pierced, the, leather, covers, to, allow, the, coloured, paper, or, silk, pages, to, be, seen, in, the, same, period, at, shiraz, appeared, lacquered, bindings, which, remain, however, very, rare, and, highly, valued, in, iran, the, decoration, of, page, margins, was, realised, in, various, ways, sometimes, they, were, inserted, in, a, different, paper, a, tradition, that, appeared, in, the, 15th, century, sprinkled, with, gold, following, a, chinese, custom, or, painted, with, colours, or, gold, the, style, of, illustrations, varied, greatly, from, one, manuscript, to, another, according, to, the, period, and, centre, of, production, tahmasp, i, was, for, the, early, years, of, his, reign, a, generous, funder, of, the, royal, workshop, who, were, responsible, for, several, of, the, most, magnificent, persian, manuscripts, but, from, the, 1540s, he, was, increasingly, troubled, by, religious, scruples, until, in, 1556, he, finally, issued, an, edict, of, sincere, repentance, attempting, to, outlaw, miniature, painting, music, and, other, arts, this, greatly, disrupted, the, arts, with, many, painters, such, as, abd, al, samad, and, mir, sayyid, ali, moving, to, india, to, develop, the, mughal, miniature, instead, these, two, were, the, trail, blazers, headhunted, by, the, mughal, emperor, humayun, when, he, was, in, exile, in, 1546, others, found, work, at, the, provincial, courts, of, tahmasp, s, relations, from, this, dispersal, of, the, royal, workshop, there, was, a, shift, in, emphasis, from, large, illustrated, books, for, the, court, to, the, production, of, single, sheets, designed, to, be, put, into, a, muraqqa, or, album, these, allowed, collectors, with, more, modest, budgets, to, acquire, works, by, leading, painters, by, the, end, of, the, century, complicated, narrative, scenes, with, many, figures, were, less, popular, replaced, by, sheets, with, single, figures, often, only, partially, painted, and, with, a, garden, background, drawn, rather, than, painted, the, master, of, this, style, was, reza, abbasi, whose, career, largely, coincided, with, the, reign, of, abbas, i, his, main, employer, although, he, painted, figures, of, old, men, his, most, common, subjects, were, beautiful, young, men, and, less, often, women, or, pairs, of, lovers, the, study, and, dating, of, ceramics, under, shah, ismail, and, shah, tahmasp, is, difficult, because, there, are, few, pieces, which, are, dated, or, which, mention, the, place, of, production, chinese, porcelain, was, collected, by, the, elite, and, more, highly, valued, than, the, local, productions, shah, abbas, i, donated, much, of, the, royal, collection, to, the, shrines, at, ardabil, and, mashad, renovating, a, room, at, ardabil, to, display, pieces, in, niches, many, locations, of, workshops, have, been, identified, although, not, with, certainty, in, particular, nishapur, kubachi, ware, kerman, moulded, monochromatic, pieces, and, mashhad, lusterware, was, revived, using, a, different, technique, from, the, earlier, production, and, typically, producing, small, pieces, with, a, design, in, a, dark, copper, colour, over, a, dark, blue, background, unlike, other, wares, these, use, traditional, middle, eastern, shapes, and, decoration, rather, than, chinese, inspired, ones, in, general, the, designs, tend, to, imitate, those, of, chinese, porcelain, with, the, production, of, blue, and, white, pieces, with, chinese, form, and, motifs, with, motifs, such, as, chi, clouds, and, dragons, the, persian, blue, is, distinguished, from, the, chinese, blue, by, its, more, numerous, and, subtle, nuances, often, quatrains,

fulfill, european, needs, the, appearance, of, false, marks, of, chinese, workshops, on, the, backs, of, some, ceramics, marked, the, taste, that, developed, in, europe, for, far, eastern, porcelain,

qajar, art, refers, to, the, art, architecture, and, art, forms, of, the, qajar, dynasty, of, the, late, persian, empire, which, lasted, from, 1781, to, 1925, the, boom, in, artistic, expression, that, occurred, during, the, qajar, era, was, the, fortunate, side, effect, of, the, period, of, relative, peace, that, accompanied, the, rule, of, agha, muhammad, khan, and, his, descendants, with, his, ascension, the, bloody, turmoil, that, had, been, the, eighteenth, century, in, persia, came, to, a, close, and, made, it, possible, for, the, peacetime, arts, to, again, flourish, european, influence, was, strong, and, produced, new, genres, like, painted, enamel, decoration, on, metal, typically, with, flowers, that, clearly, draw, on, french, and, other, european, styles, lacquer, on, wood, is, used, in, a, similar, way, painting, now, adopted, the, european, technique, of, oil, painting, large, murals, of, scenes, of, revelry, and, historical, scenes, were, produced, as, murals, for, palaces, and, coffee, houses, and, many, portraits, have, an, arched, top, showing, they, were, intended, to, be, inset, into, walls, qajar, art, has, a, distinctive, style, of, portraiture, the, roots, of, traditional, qajar, painting, can, be, found, in, the, style, of, painting, that, arose, during, the, preceding, safavid, empire, during, this, time, there, was, a, great, deal, of, european, influence, on, persian, culture, especially, in, the, arts, of, the, royalty, and, noble, classes, though, some, modelling, is, used, heavy, application, of, paint, and, large, areas, of, flat, dark, rich, saturated, colours, predominate, while, the, depiction, of, inanimate, objects, and, still, lifes, is, seen, to, be, very, realistic, in, qajar, painting, the, depiction, of, human, beings, is, decidedly, idealised, this, is, especially, evident, in, the, portrayal, of, qajar, royalty, where, the, subjects, of, the, paintings, are, very, formulaically, placed, with, standardised, features, however, the, impact, of, photography, greatly, increased, the, individuality, of, portraits, in, the, later, 19th, century, kamal, ol, molk, 1845, 1940, came, from, a, family, of, court, painters, but, also, trained, with, a, painter, who, had, studied, in, europe, after, a, career, at, court, he, visited, europe, in, 1898, at, the, age, of, 47, staying, for, some, four, years, he, was, one, of, the, artists, who, introduced, a, more, european, style, to, persian, painting, most, famous, of, the, qajar, artworks, are, the, portraits, that, were, made, of, the, various, persian, shahs, each, ruler, and, many, of, their, sons, and, other, relatives, commissioned, official, portraits, of, themselves, either, for, private, use, or, public, display, the, most, famous, of, these, are, the, myriad, portraits, which, were, painted, of, fath, ali, shah, qajar, who, with, his, narrow, waist, long, black, bifurcated, beard, and, deepest, eyes, has, come, to, exemplify, the, romantic, image, of, the, great, oriental, ruler, many, of, these, paintings, were, by, the, artist, mihr, ali, while, the, portraits, were, executed, at, various, points, throughout, the, life, of, the, shah, they, adhere, to, a, canon, in, which, the, distinctive, features, of, the, ruler, are, emphasized, there, are, portraits, of, fath, ali, shah, in, a, very, wide, assortment, of, settings, from, the, armour, clad, warrior, king, to, the, flower, smelling, gentleman, but, all, are, similar, in, their, depiction, of, the, shah, differing, only, slightly, usually, due, to, the, specific, artist, of, the, portrait, it, is, only, appropriate, that, this, particular, shah, be, so, immortalized, in, this, style, as, it, was, under, his, rule, as, the, second, qajar, shah, that, the, style, truly, flourished, one, reason, for, this, were, the, stronger, and, stronger, diplomatic, ties, that, the, qajar, rulers, were, nurturing, with, european, powers
