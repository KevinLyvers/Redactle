musical, notation, is, any, system, used, to, visually, represent, music, systems, of, notation, generally, represent, the, elements, of, a, piece, of, music, that, are, considered, important, for, its, performance, in, the, context, of, a, given, musical, tradition, the, process, of, interpreting, musical, notation, is, often, referred, to, as, reading, music, distinct, methods, of, notation, have, been, invented, throughout, history, by, various, cultures, much, information, about, ancient, music, notation, is, fragmentary, even, in, the, same, time, frames, different, styles, of, music, and, different, cultures, use, different, music, notation, methods, for, example, classical, performers, most, often, use, sheet, music, using, staves, time, signatures, key, signatures, and, noteheads, for, writing, and, deciphering, pieces, but, even, so, there, are, far, more, systems, just, that, for, instance, in, professional, country, music, the, nashville, number, system, is, the, main, method, and, for, string, instruments, such, as, guitar, it, is, quite, common, for, tablature, to, be, used, by, players, the, symbols, used, include, ancient, symbols, and, modern, symbols, made, upon, any, media, such, as, symbols, cut, into, stone, made, in, clay, tablets, made, using, a, pen, on, papyrus, or, parchment, or, manuscript, paper, printed, using, a, printing, press, c, 1400, a, computer, printer, c, 1980, or, other, printing, or, modern, copying, technology, although, many, ancient, cultures, used, symbols, to, represent, melodies, and, rhythms, none, of, them, were, particularly, comprehensive, which, has, limited, today, s, understanding, of, their, music, the, direct, ancestor, of, the, modern, western, system, of, notation, emerged, in, medieval, europe, in, the, context, of, the, christian, church, s, attempts, to, standardize, the, performance, of, plainsong, melodies, so, that, chants, could, be, standardized, across, different, areas, notation, developed, further, during, the, renaissance, and, baroque, music, eras, in, the, classical, period, 1750, 1820, and, the, romantic, music, era, 1820, 1900, notation, continued, to, develop, as, the, technology, for, musical, instruments, developed, in, the, contemporary, classical, music, of, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, music, notation, has, continued, to, develop, with, the, introduction, of, graphical, notation, by, some, modern, composers, and, the, use, since, the, 1980s, of, computer, based, scorewriter, programs, for, notating, music, music, notation, has, been, adapted, to, many, kinds, of, music, including, classical, music, popular, music, and, traditional, music, the, earliest, form, of, musical, notation, can, be, found, in, a, cuneiform, tablet, that, was, created, at, nippur, in, babylonia, today, s, iraq, in, about, 1400, bce, the, tablet, represents, fragmentary, instructions, for, performing, music, that, the, music, was, composed, in, harmonies, of, thirds, and, that, it, was, written, using, a, diatonic, scale, a, tablet, from, about, 1250, bce, shows, a, more, developed, form, of, notation, although, the, interpretation, of, the, notation, system, is, still, controversial, it, is, clear, that, the, notation, indicates, the, names, of, strings, on, a, lyre, the, tuning, of, which, is, described, in, other, tablets, although, they, are, fragmentary, these, tablets, represent, the, earliest, notated, melodies, found, anywhere, in, the, world, ancient, greek, musical, notation, was, in, use, from, at, least, the, 6th, century, bce, until, approximately, the, 4th, century, ce, only, one, complete, composition, seikilos, epitaph, and, a, number, of, fragments, using, this, notation, survive, the, notation, for, sung, music, consists, of, letter, symbols, for, the, pitches, placed, above, text, syllables, rhythm, is, indicated, in, a, rudimentary, way, only, with, long, and, short, symbols, the, seikilos, epitaph, has, been, variously, dated, between, the, 2nd, century, bce, to, the, 2nd, century, ce, three, hymns, by, mesomedes, of, crete, exist, in, manuscript, the, delphic, hymns, dated, to, the, 2nd, century, bce, also, use, this, notation, but, they, are, not, completely, preserved, ancient, greek, notation, appears, to, have, fallen, out, of, use, around, the, time, of, the, decline, of, the, western, roman, empire, byzantine, music, once, included, music, for, court, ceremonies, but, has, only, survived, as, vocal, church, music, within, various, orthodox, traditions, of, monodic, monophonic, chant, written, down, in, byzantine, round, notation, see, macarie, s, anastasimatarion, with, the, greek, text, translated, into, romanian, and, transliterated, into, cyrillic, script, since, the, 6th, century, greek, theoretical, categories, melos, genos, harmonia, systema, played, a, key, role, to, understand, and, transmit, byzantine, music, especially, the, tradition, of, damascus, had, a, strong, impact, on, the, pre, islamic, near, east, comparable, to, the, impact, coming, from, persian, music, the, earliest, evidence, are, papyrus, fragments, of, greek, tropologia, these, fragments, just, present, the, hymn, text, following, a, modal, signature, or, key, like, for, echos, plagios, protos, or, for, echos, devteros, unlike, western, notation, byzantine, neumes, used, since, the, 10th, century, were, always, related, to, modal, steps, same, modal, degree, one, degree, lower, two, degrees, higher, etc, in, relation, to, such, a, clef, or, modal, key, modal, signatures, originally, this, key, or, the, incipit, of, a, common, melody, was, enough, to, indicate, a, certain, melodic, model, given, within, the, echos, next, to, ekphonetic, notation, only, used, in, lectionaries, to, indicate, formulas, used, during, scriptural, lessons, melodic, notation, developed, not, earlier, than, between, the, 9th, and, the, 10th, century, when, a, theta, oxeia, or, diple, were, written, under, a, certain, syllable, of, the, text, whenever, a, longer, melisma, was, expected, this, primitive, form, was, called, theta, or, diple, notation, today, one, can, study, the, evolution, of, this, notation, in, greek, monastic, chant, books, like, those, of, the, sticherarion, and, the, heirmologion, chartres, notation, was, rather, used, on, mount, athos, and, constantinople, coislin, notation, within, the, patriarchates, of, jerusalem, and, alexandria, while, there, was, another, gestic, notation, originally, used, for, the, asmatikon, choir, book, and, kontakarion, book, of, the, soloist, or, monophonaris, of, the, constantinopolitan, cathedral, rite, the, earliest, books, which, have, survived, are, kondakars, in, slavonic, translation, which, already, show, a, notation, system, known, as, kondakarian, notation, like, the, greek, alphabet, notational, signs, are, ordered, left, to, right, though, the, direction, could, be, adapted, like, in, certain, syriac, manuscripts, the, question, of, rhythm, was, entirely, based, on, cheironomia, the, interpretation, of, so, called, great, signs, which, derived, from, different, chant, books, these, great, signs, indicated, well, known, melodic, phrases, given, by, gestures, of, the, choirleaders, of, the, cathedral, rite, they, existed, once, as, part, of, an, oral, tradition, developed, kondakarian, notation, and, became, during, the, 13th, century, integrated, into, byzantine, round, notation, as, a, kind, of, universal, notation, system, today, the, main, difference, between, western, and, eastern, neumes, is, that, eastern, notation, symbols, are, differential, rather, than, absolute, i, e, they, indicate, pitch, steps, rising, falling, or, at, the, same, step, and, the, musicians, know, to, deduce, correctly, from, the, score, and, the, note, they, are, singing, presently, which, correct, interval, is, meant, these, step, symbols, themselves, or, better, phonic, neumes, resemble, brush, strokes, and, are, colloquially, called, g, ntzoi, hooks, in, modern, greek, notes, as, pitch, classes, or, modal, keys, usually, memorised, by, modal, signatures, are, represented, in, written, form, only, between, these, neumes, in, manuscripts, usually, written, in, red, ink, in, modern, notation, they, simply, serve, as, an, optional, reminder, and, modal, and, tempo, directions, have, been, added, if, necessary, in, papadic, notation, medial, signatures, usually, meant, a, temporary, change, into, another, echos, the, so, called, great, signs, were, once, related, to, cheironomic, signs, according, to, modern, interpretations, they, are, understood, as, embellishments, and, microtonal, attractions, pitch, changes, smaller, than, a, semitone, both, essential, in, byzantine, chant, since, chrysanthos, of, madytos, there, are, seven, standard, note, names, used, for, solf, ge, parallag, p, v, g, h, d, h, i, k, z, n, while, the, older, practice, still, used, the, four, enechemata, or, intonation, formulas, of, the, four, echoi, given, by, the, modal, signatures, the, authentic, or, kyrioi, in, ascending, direction, and, the, plagal, or, plagioi, in, descending, direction, papadic, octoechos, with, exception, of, v, and, z, they, do, roughly, correspond, to, western, solmization, syllables, as, re, mi, fa, sol, la, si, do, byzantine, music, uses, the, eight, natural, non, tempered, scales, whose, elements, were, identified, by, khoi, sounds, exclusively, and, therefore, the, absolute, pitch, of, each, note, may, slightly, vary, each, time, depending, on, the, particular, khos, used, byzantine, notation, is, still, used, in, many, orthodox, churches, sometimes, cantors, also, use, transcriptions, into, western, or, kievan, staff, notation, while, adding, non, notatable, embellishment, material, from, memory, and, sliding, into, the, natural, scales, from, experience, but, even, concerning, modern, neume, editions, since, the, reform, of, chrysanthos, a, lot, of, details, are, only, known, from, an, oral, tradition, related, to, traditional, masters, and, their, experience, in, 1252, safi, al, din, al, urmawi, developed, a, form, of, musical, notation, where, rhythms, were, represented, by, geometric, representation, many, subsequent, scholars, of, rhythm, have, sought, to, develop, graphical, geometrical, notations, for, example, a, similar, geometric, system, was, published, in, 1987, by, kjell, gustafson, whose, method, represents, a, rhythm, as, a, two, dimensional, graph, the, scholar, and, music, theorist, isidore, of, seville, while, writing, in, the, early, 7th, century, considered, that, unless, sounds, are, held, by, the, memory, of, man, they, perish, because, they, cannot, be, written, down, by, the, middle, of, the, 9th, century, however, a, form, of, neumatic, notation, began, to, develop, in, monasteries, in, europe, as, a, mnemonic, device, for, gregorian, chant, using, symbols, known, as, neumes, the, earliest, surviving, musical, notation, of, this, type, is, in, the, musica, disciplina, of, aurelian, of, r, me, from, about, 850, there, are, scattered, survivals, from, the, iberian, peninsula, before, this, time, of, a, type, of, notation, known, as, visigothic, neumes, but, its, few, surviving, fragments, have, not, yet, been, deciphered, the, problem, with, this, notation, was, that, it, only, showed, melodic, contours, and, consequently, the, music, could, not, be, read, by, someone, who, did, not, know, the, music, already, notation, had, developed, far, enough, to, notate, melody, but, there, was, still, no, system, for, notating, rhythm, a, mid, 13th, century, treatise, de, mensurabili, musica, explains, a, set, of, six, rhythmic, modes, that, were, in, use, at, the, time, although, it, is, not, clear, how, they, were, formed, these, rhythmic, modes, were, all, in, triple, time, and, rather, limited, rhythm, in, chant, to, six, different, repeating, patterns, this, was, a, flaw, seen, by, german, music, theorist, franco, of, cologne, and, summarised, as, part, of, his, treatise, ars, cantus, mensurabilis, the, art, of, measured, chant, or, mensural, notation, he, suggested, that, individual, notes, could, have, their, own, rhythms, represented, by, the, shape, of, the, note, not, until, the, 14th, century, did, something, like, the, present, system, of, fixed, note, lengths, arise, the, use, of, regular, measures, bars, became, commonplace, by, the, end, of, the, 17th, century, the, founder, of, what, is, now, considered, the, standard, music, staff, was, guido, d, arezzo, an, italian, benedictine, monk, who, lived, from, about, 991, until, after, 1033, he, taught, the, use, of, solmization, syllables, based, on, a, hymn, to, saint, john, the, baptist, which, begins, ut, queant, laxis, and, was, written, by, the, lombard, historian, paul, the, deacon, the, first, stanza, is, guido, used, the, first, syllable, of, each, line, ut, re, mi, fa, sol, la, and, si, to, read, notated, music, in, terms, of, hexachords, they, were, not, note, names, and, each, could, depending, on, context, be, applied, to, any, note, in, the, 17th, century, ut, was, changed, in, most, countries, except, france, to, the, easily, singable, open, syllable, do, believed, to, have, been, taken, either, from, the, name, of, the, italian, theorist, giovanni, battista, do, ni, or, from, the, latin, word, do, minus, meaning, lord, christian, monks, developed, the, first, forms, of, modern, european, musical, notation, in, order, to, standardize, liturgy, throughout, the, worldwide, church, and, an, enormous, body, of, religious, music, has, been, composed, for, it, through, the, ages, this, led, directly, to, the, emergence, and, development, of, european, classical, music, and, its, many, derivatives, the, baroque, style, which, encompassed, music, art, and, architecture, was, particularly, encouraged, by, the, post, reformation, catholic, church, as, such, forms, offered, a, means, of, religious, expression, that, was, stirring, and, emotional, intended, to, stimulate, religious, fervor, modern, music, notation, is, used, by, musicians, of, many, different, genres, throughout, the, world, the, staff, or, stave, in, british, english, consists, of, 5, parallel, horizontal, lines, which, acts, as, a, framework, upon, which, pitches, are, indicated, by, placing, oval, note, heads, on, ie, crossing, the, staff, lines, between, the, lines, ie, in, the, spaces, or, above, and, below, the, staff, using, small, additional, lines, called, ledger, lines, notation, is, read, from, left, to, right, which, makes, setting, music, for, right, to, left, scripts, difficult, the, pitch, of, a, note, is, indicated, by, the, vertical, position, of, the, note, head, within, the, staff, and, can, be, modified, by, accidentals, the, duration, note, length, or, note, value, is, indicated, by, the, form, of, the, note, head, or, with, the, addition, of, a, note, stem, plus, beams, or, flags, a, stemless, hollow, oval, is, a, whole, note, or, semibreve, a, hollow, rectangle, or, stemless, hollow, oval, with, one, or, two, vertical, lines, on, both, sides, is, a, double, whole, note, or, breve, a, stemmed, hollow, oval, is, a, half, note, or, minim, solid, ovals, always, use, stems, and, can, indicate, quarter, notes, crotchets, or, with, added, beams, or, flags, smaller, subdivisions, additional, symbols, such, as, dots, and, ties, can, lengthen, the, duration, of, a, note, a, staff, of, written, music, generally, begins, with, a, clef, which, indicates, the, pitch, range, of, the, staff, the, treble, clef, or, g, clef, was, originally, a, letter, g, and, it, identifies, the, second, line, up, on, the, five, line, staff, as, the, note, g, above, middle, c, the, bass, clef, or, f, clef, identifies, the, second, line, down, as, the, note, f, below, middle, c, while, the, treble, and, bass, clef, are, the, most, widely, used, other, clefs, which, identify, middle, c, are, used, for, some, instruments, such, as, the, alto, clef, for, viola, and, alto, trombone, and, the, tenor, clef, used, for, some, cello, bassoon, tenor, trombone, and, double, bass, music, some, instruments, use, mainly, one, clef, such, as, violin, and, flute, which, use, treble, clef, and, double, bass, and, tuba, which, use, bass, clef, some, instruments, such, as, piano, and, pipe, organ, regularly, use, both, treble, and, bass, clefs, following, the, clef, the, key, signature, is, a, group, of, 0, to, 7, sharp, or, flat, signs, placed, on, the, staff, to, indicate, the, key, of, the, piece, or, song, by, specifying, that, certain, notes, are, sharp, or, flat, throughout, the, piece, unless, otherwise, indicated, with, accidentals, added, before, certain, notes, when, a, flat, sign, is, placed, before, a, note, the, pitch, of, the, note, is, lowered, by, one, semitone, similarly, a, sharp, sign, raises, the, pitch, by, one, semitone, for, example, a, sharp, on, the, note, d, would, raise, it, to, d, while, a, flat, would, lower, it, to, d, double, sharps, and, double, flats, are, less, common, but, they, are, used, a, double, sharp, is, placed, before, a, note, to, make, it, two, semitones, higher, a, double, flat, two, semitones, lower, a, natural, sign, placed, before, a, note, renders, that, note, in, its, natural, form, which, means, that, any, sharp, or, flat, applied, to, that, note, from, the, key, signature, or, an, accidental, is, cancelled, sometimes, a, courtesy, accidental, is, used, in, music, where, it, is, not, technically, required, to, remind, the, musician, of, what, pitch, is, required, following, the, key, signature, is, the, time, signature, the, time, signature, typically, consists, of, two, numbers, with, one, of, the, most, common, being, 4, 4, the, top, 4, indicates, that, there, are, four, beats, per, measure, also, called, bar, the, bottom, 4, indicates, that, each, of, those, beats, are, quarter, notes, measures, divide, the, piece, into, groups, of, beats, and, the, time, signatures, specify, those, groupings, 4, 4, is, used, so, often, that, it, is, also, called, common, time, and, it, may, be, indicated, with, rather, than, numbers, other, frequently, used, time, signatures, are, 3, 4, three, beats, per, bar, with, each, beat, being, a, quarter, note, 2, 4, two, beats, per, bar, with, each, beat, being, a, quarter, note, 6, 8, six, beats, per, bar, with, each, beat, being, an, eighth, note, and, 12, 8, twelve, beats, per, bar, with, each, beat, being, an, eighth, note, in, practice, the, eighth, notes, are, typically, put, into, four, groups, of, three, eighth, notes, 12, 8, is, a, compound, time, type, of, time, signature, many, other, time, signatures, exist, such, as, 2, 2, many, short, classical, music, pieces, from, the, classical, era, and, songs, from, traditional, music, and, popular, music, are, in, one, time, signature, for, much, or, all, of, the, piece, music, from, the, romantic, music, era, and, later, particularly, contemporary, classical, music, and, rock, music, genres, such, as, progressive, rock, and, the, hardcore, punk, subgenre, mathcore, may, use, mixed, meter, songs, or, pieces, change, from, one, meter, to, another, for, example, alternating, between, bars, of, 5, 4, and, 7, 8, directions, to, the, player, regarding, matters, such, as, tempo, e, g, andante, and, dynamics, e, g, forte, appear, above, or, below, the, staff, terms, indicating, the, musical, expression, or, feel, to, a, song, or, piece, are, indicated, at, the, beginning, of, the, piece, and, at, any, points, where, the, mood, changes, e, g, gelassen, for, vocal, music, lyrics, are, written, near, the, pitches, of, the, melody, for, short, pauses, breaths, retakes, retakes, are, indicated, with, a, mark, are, added, in, music, for, ensembles, a, score, shows, music, for, all, players, together, with, the, staves, for, the, different, instruments, and, or, voices, stacked, vertically, the, conductor, uses, the, score, while, leading, an, orchestra, concert, band, choir, or, other, large, ensemble, individual, performers, in, an, ensemble, play, from, parts, which, contain, only, the, music, played, by, an, individual, musician, a, score, can, be, constructed, from, a, complete, set, of, parts, and, vice, versa, the, process, was, laborious, and, time, consuming, when, parts, were, hand, copied, from, the, score, but, since, the, development, of, scorewriter, computer, software, in, the, 1980s, a, score, stored, electronically, can, have, parts, automatically, prepared, by, the, program, and, quickly, and, inexpensively, printed, out, using, a, computer, printer, jeongganbo, is, a, traditional, musical, notation, system, created, during, the, time, of, sejong, the, great, that, was, the, first, east, asian, system, to, represent, rhythm, pitch, and, time, among, various, kinds, of, korean, traditional, music, jeong, gan, bo, targets, a, particular, genre, jeong, ak, jeong, gan, bo, specifies, the, pitch, by, writing, the, pitch, s, name, down, in, a, box, called, jeong, gan, one, jeong, gan, is, one, beat, each, and, it, can, be, split, into, two, three, or, more, to, hold, half, beats, and, quarter, beats, and, more, also, there, are, many, markings, indicating, things, such, as, ornaments, most, of, these, were, later, created, by, ki, su, kim, the, samaveda, text, 1200, bce, 1000, bce, contains, notated, melodies, and, these, are, probably, the, world, s, oldest, surviving, ones, the, musical, notation, is, written, usually, immediately, above, sometimes, within, the, line, of, samaveda, text, either, in, syllabic, or, a, numerical, form, depending, on, the, samavedic, sakha, school, the, indian, scholar, and, musical, theorist, pingala, c, 200, bce, in, his, chanda, sutra, used, marks, indicating, long, and, short, syllables, to, indicate, meters, in, sanskrit, poetry, a, rock, inscription, from, circa, 7th, 8th, century, ce, at, kudumiyanmalai, tamil, nadu, contains, an, early, example, of, a, musical, notation, it, was, first, identified, and, published, by, archaeologist, epigraphist, d, r, bhandarkar, written, in, the, pallava, grantha, script, of, the, 7th, century, it, contains, 38, horizontal, lines, of, notations, inscribed, on, a, rectangular, rock, face, dimension, of, around, 13, by, 14, feet, each, line, of, the, notation, contains, 64, characters, characters, representing, musical, notes, written, in, groups, of, four, notes, the, basic, characters, for, the, seven, notes, sa, ri, ga, ma, pa, dha, ni, are, seen, to, be, suffixed, with, the, vowels, a, i, u, e, for, example, in, the, place, of, sa, any, one, of, sa, si, su, or, se, is, used, similarly, in, place, of, ri, any, one, of, ra, ri, ru, or, re, is, used, horizontal, lines, divide, the, notation, into, 7, sections, each, section, contains, 4, to, 7, lines, of, notation, with, a, title, indicating, its, musical, mode, these, modes, may, have, been, popular, at, least, from, the, 6th, century, ce, and, were, incorporated, into, the, indian, raga, system, that, developed, later, but, some, of, the, unusual, features, seen, in, this, notation, have, been, given, several, non, conclusive, interpretations, by, scholars, in, the, notation, of, indian, r, ga, a, solfege, like, system, called, sargam, is, used, as, in, western, solfege, there, are, names, for, the, seven, basic, pitches, of, a, major, scale, shadja, rishabha, gandhara, madhyama, panchama, dhaivata, and, nishada, usually, shortened, to, sa, re, ga, ma, pa, dha, ni, the, tonic, of, any, scale, is, named, sa, and, the, dominant, pa, sa, is, fixed, in, any, scale, and, pa, is, fixed, at, a, fifth, above, it, a, pythagorean, fifth, rather, than, an, equal, tempered, fifth, these, two, notes, are, known, as, achala, swar, fixed, notes, each, of, the, other, five, notes, re, ga, ma, dha, and, ni, can, take, a, regular, shuddha, pitch, which, is, equivalent, to, its, pitch, in, a, standard, major, scale, thus, shuddha, re, the, second, degree, of, the, scale, is, a, whole, step, higher, than, sa, or, an, altered, pitch, either, a, half, step, above, or, half, step, below, the, shuddha, pitch, re, ga, dha, and, ni, all, have, altered, partners, that, are, a, half, step, lower, komal, flat, thus, komal, re, is, a, half, step, higher, than, sa, ma, has, an, altered, partner, that, is, a, half, step, higher, teevra, sharp, thus, tivra, ma, is, an, augmented, fourth, above, sa, re, ga, ma, dha, and, ni, are, called, vikrut, swar, movable, notes, in, the, written, system, of, indian, notation, devised, by, ravi, shankar, the, pitches, are, represented, by, western, letters, capital, letters, are, used, for, the, achala, swar, and, for, the, higher, variety, of, all, the, vikrut, swar, lowercase, letters, are, used, for, the, lower, variety, of, the, vikrut, swar, other, systems, exist, for, non, twelve, tone, equal, temperament, and, non, western, music, such, as, the, indian, swaralipi, znamenny, chant, is, a, singing, tradition, used, in, the, russian, orthodox, church, which, uses, a, hook, and, banner, notation, znamenny, chant, is, unison, melismatic, liturgical, singing, that, has, its, own, specific, notation, called, the, stolp, notation, the, symbols, used, in, the, stolp, notation, are, called, kryuki, russian, hooks, or, znamyona, russian, banners, often, the, names, of, the, signs, are, used, to, refer, to, the, stolp, notation, znamenny, melodies, are, part, of, a, system, consisting, of, eight, modes, intonation, structures, called, glasy, the, melodies, are, characterized, by, fluency, and, well, balancedness, there, exist, several, types, of, znamenny, chant, the, so, called, stolpovoy, malyj, little, and, bolshoy, great, znamenny, chant, ruthenian, chant, prostopinije, is, sometimes, considered, a, sub, division, of, the, znamenny, chant, tradition, with, the, muscovite, chant, znamenny, chant, proper, being, the, second, branch, of, the, same, musical, continuum, znamenny, chants, are, not, written, with, notes, the, so, called, linear, notation, but, with, special, signs, called, znam, na, russian, for, marks, banners, or, kryuki, hooks, as, some, shapes, of, these, signs, resemble, hooks, each, sign, may, include, the, following, components, a, large, black, hook, or, a, black, stroke, several, smaller, black, points, and, commas, and, lines, near, the, hook, or, crossing, the, hook, some, signs, may, mean, only, one, note, some, 2, to, 4, notes, and, some, a, whole, melody, of, more, than, 10, notes, with, a, complicated, rhythmic, structure, the, stolp, notation, was, developed, in, kievan, rus, as, an, east, slavic, refinement, of, the, byzantine, neumatic, musical, notation, the, most, notable, feature, of, this, notation, system, is, that, it, records, transitions, of, the, melody, rather, than, notes, the, signs, also, represent, a, mood, and, a, gradation, of, how, this, part, of, melody, is, to, be, sung, tempo, strength, devotion, meekness, etc, every, sign, has, its, own, name, and, also, features, as, a, spiritual, symbol, for, example, there, is, a, specific, sign, called, little, dove, russian, golubchik, which, represents, two, rising, sounds, but, which, is, also, a, symbol, of, the, holy, ghost, gradually, the, system, became, more, and, more, complicated, this, system, was, also, ambiguous, so, that, almost, no, one, except, the, most, trained, and, educated, singers, could, sing, an, unknown, melody, at, sight, the, signs, only, helped, to, reproduce, the, melody, not, coding, it, in, an, unambiguous, way, see, byzantine, empire, the, earliest, known, examples, of, text, referring, to, music, in, china, are, inscriptions, on, musical, instruments, found, in, the, tomb, of, marquis, yi, of, zeng, d, 433, b, c, sets, of, 41, chimestones, and, 65, bells, bore, lengthy, inscriptions, concerning, pitches, scales, and, transposition, the, bells, still, sound, the, pitches, that, their, inscriptions, refer, to, although, no, notated, musical, compositions, were, found, the, inscriptions, indicate, that, the, system, was, sufficiently, advanced, to, allow, for, musical, notation, two, systems, of, pitch, nomenclature, existed, one, for, relative, pitch, and, one, for, absolute, pitch, for, relative, pitch, a, solmization, system, was, used, gongche, notation, used, chinese, characters, for, the, names, of, the, scale, japanese, music, is, highly, diversified, and, therefore, requires, various, systems, of, notation, in, japanese, shakuhachi, music, for, example, glissandos, and, timbres, are, often, more, significant, than, distinct, pitches, whereas, taiko, notation, focuses, on, discrete, strokes, ryukyuan, sanshin, music, uses, kunkunshi, a, notation, system, of, kanji, with, each, character, corresponding, to, a, finger, position, on, a, particular, string, notation, plays, a, relatively, minor, role, in, the, oral, traditions, of, indonesia, however, in, java, and, bali, several, systems, were, devised, beginning, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, initially, for, archival, purposes, today, the, most, widespread, are, cipher, notations, not, angka, in, the, broadest, sense, in, which, the, pitches, are, represented, with, some, subset, of, the, numbers, 1, to, 7, with, 1, corresponding, to, either, highest, note, of, a, particular, octave, as, in, sundanese, gamelan, or, lowest, as, in, the, kepatihan, notation, of, javanese, gamelan, notes, in, the, ranges, outside, the, central, octave, are, represented, with, one, or, more, dots, above, or, below, the, each, number, for, the, most, part, these, cipher, notations, are, mainly, used, to, notate, the, skeletal, melody, the, balungan, and, vocal, parts, gerongan, although, transcriptions, of, the, elaborating, instrument, variations, are, sometimes, used, for, analysis, and, teaching, drum, parts, are, notated, with, a, system, of, symbols, largely, based, on, letters, representing, the, vocables, used, to, learn, and, remember, drumming, patterns, these, symbols, are, typically, laid, out, in, a, grid, underneath, the, skeletal, melody, for, a, specific, or, generic, piece, the, symbols, used, for, drum, notation, as, well, as, the, vocables, represented, are, highly, variable, from, place, to, place, and, performer, to, performer, in, addition, to, these, current, systems, two, older, notations, used, a, kind, of, staff, the, solonese, script, could, capture, the, flexible, rhythms, of, the, pesinden, with, a, squiggle, on, a, horizontal, staff, while, in, yogyakarta, a, ladder, like, vertical, staff, allowed, notation, of, the, balungan, by, dots, and, also, included, important, drum, strokes, in, bali, there, are, a, few, books, published, of, gamelan, gender, wayang, pieces, employing, alphabetical, notation, in, the, old, balinese, script, composers, and, scholars, both, indonesian, and, foreign, have, also, mapped, the, slendro, and, pelog, tuning, systems, of, gamelan, onto, the, western, staff, with, and, without, various, symbols, for, microtones, the, dutch, composer, ton, de, leeuw, also, invented, a, three, line, staff, for, his, composition, gending, however, these, systems, do, not, enjoy, widespread, use, in, the, second, half, of, the, twentieth, century, indonesian, musicians, and, scholars, extended, cipher, notation, to, other, oral, traditions, and, a, diatonic, scale, cipher, notation, has, become, common, for, notating, western, related, genres, church, hymns, popular, songs, and, so, forth, unlike, the, cipher, notation, for, gamelan, music, which, uses, a, fixed, do, that, is, 1, always, corresponds, to, the, same, pitch, within, the, natural, variability, of, gamelan, tuning, indonesian, diatonic, cipher, notation, is, moveable, do, notation, so, scores, must, indicate, which, pitch, corresponds, to, the, number, 1, for, example, 1, c, ancient, jewish, texts, include, a, series, of, marks, assigning, musical, cantillation, notes, known, in, hebrew, as, ta, amim, and, yiddish, as, trope, there, are, records, of, these, marks, from, the, 6th, and, 7th, centuries, having, been, passed, down, as, a, tradition, for, jewish, prayers, and, texts, traditionally, a, series, of, marks, written, above, and, around, the, accompanying, hebrew, texts, trope, marks, represent, a, short, musical, motif, throughout, the, jewish, diaspora, there, are, variations, in, the, accompanying, melodies, there, are, three, main, systems, of, hebrew, cantillation, the, babylonian, system, the, palestinian, system, and, the, tiberian, system, cipher, notation, systems, assigning, arabic, numerals, to, the, major, scale, degrees, have, been, used, at, least, since, the, iberian, organ, tablatures, of, the, 16th, century, and, include, such, exotic, adaptations, as, siffernotskrift, the, one, most, widely, in, use, today, is, the, chinese, jianpu, discussed, in, the, main, article, numerals, can, also, be, assigned, to, different, scale, systems, as, in, the, javanese, kepatihan, notation, described, above, solf, ge, is, a, way, of, assigning, syllables, to, names, of, the, musical, scale, in, order, they, are, today, do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti, do, for, the, octave, the, classic, variation, is, do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, si, do, the, first, western, system, of, functional, names, for, the, musical, notes, was, introduced, by, guido, of, arezzo, c, 991, after, 1033, using, the, beginning, syllables, of, the, first, six, musical, lines, of, the, latin, hymn, ut, queant, laxis, the, original, sequence, was, ut, re, mi, fa, sol, la, where, each, verse, started, a, scale, note, higher, ut, later, became, do, the, equivalent, syllables, used, in, indian, music, are, sa, re, ga, ma, pa, dha, ni, see, also, solf, ge, sargam, kod, ly, hand, signs, tonic, sol, fa, is, a, type, of, notation, using, the, initial, letters, of, solf, ge, the, notes, of, the, 12, tone, scale, can, be, written, by, their, letter, names, a, g, possibly, with, a, trailing, accidental, such, as, a, or, b, abc, notation, is, a, compact, format, using, plain, text, characters, readable, by, computers, and, by, humans, more, than, 100, 000, tunes, are, now, transcribed, in, this, format, tablature, was, first, used, in, the, middle, ages, for, organ, music, and, later, in, the, renaissance, for, lute, music, in, most, lute, tablatures, a, staff, is, used, but, instead, of, pitch, values, the, lines, of, the, staff, represent, the, strings, of, the, instrument, the, frets, to, finger, are, written, on, each, line, indicated, by, letters, or, numbers, rhythm, is, written, separately, with, one, or, another, variation, of, standard, note, values, indicating, the, duration, of, the, fastest, moving, part, few, seem, to, have, remarked, on, the, fact, that, tablature, combines, in, one, notation, system, both, the, physical, and, technical, requirements, of, play, the, lines, and, symbols, on, them, and, in, relation, to, each, other, representing, the, actual, performance, actions, with, the, unfolding, of, the, music, itself, the, lines, of, tablature, taken, horizontally, represent, the, actual, temporal, unfolding, of, the, music, in, later, periods, lute, and, guitar, music, was, written, with, standard, notation, tablature, caught, interest, again, in, the, late, 20th, century, for, popular, guitar, music, and, other, fretted, instruments, being, easy, to, transcribe, and, share, over, the, internet, in, ascii, format, some, chromatic, systems, have, been, created, taking, advantage, of, the, layout, of, black, and, white, keys, of, the, standard, piano, keyboard, the, staff, is, most, widely, referred, to, as, piano, roll, created, by, extending, the, black, and, white, piano, keys, klavarskribo, sometimes, shortened, to, klavar, is, a, music, notation, system, that, was, introduced, in, 1931, by, the, dutchman, cornelis, pot, the, name, means, keyboard, writing, in, esperanto, it, differs, from, conventional, music, notation, in, a, number, of, ways, and, is, intended, to, be, easily, readable, many, klavar, readers, are, from, the, netherlands, over, the, past, three, centuries, hundreds, of, music, notation, systems, have, been, proposed, as, alternatives, to, traditional, western, music, notation, many, of, these, systems, seek, to, improve, upon, traditional, notation, by, using, a, chromatic, staff, in, which, each, of, the, 12, pitch, classes, has, its, own, unique, place, on, the, staff, an, example, is, jacques, daniel, rochat, s, dodeka, music, notation, these, notation, systems, do, not, require, the, use, of, standard, key, signatures, accidentals, or, clef, signs, they, also, represent, interval, relationships, more, consistently, and, accurately, than, traditional, notation, e, g, major, 3rds, appear, wider, than, minor, 3rds, many, of, these, systems, are, described, and, illustrated, in, gardner, read, s, source, book, of, proposed, music, notation, reforms, the, term, graphic, notation, refers, to, the, contemporary, use, of, non, traditional, symbols, and, text, to, convey, information, about, the, performance, of, a, piece, of, music, composers, such, as, johanna, beyer, christian, wolff, carmen, barradas, earle, brown, yoko, ono, anthony, braxton, john, cage, morton, feldman, cathy, berberian, graciela, castillo, krzysztof, penderecki, cornelius, cardew, pauline, oliveros, and, roger, reynolds, are, among, the, early, generation, of, practitioners, the, book, notations, by, john, cage, and, alison, knowles, is, another, example, of, this, kind, of, notation, simplified, music, notation, is, an, alternative, form, of, musical, notation, designed, to, make, sight, reading, easier, it, is, based, on, classical, staff, notation, but, incorporates, sharps, and, flats, into, the, shape, of, the, note, heads, notes, such, as, double, sharps, and, double, flats, are, written, at, the, pitch, they, are, actually, played, at, but, preceded, by, symbols, called, history, signs, that, show, they, have, been, transposed, modified, stave, notation, msn, is, an, alternative, way, of, notating, music, for, people, who, cannot, easily, read, ordinary, musical, notation, even, if, it, is, enlarged, parsons, code, is, used, to, encode, music, so, that, it, can, be, easily, searched, braille, music, is, a, complete, well, developed, and, internationally, accepted, musical, notation, system, that, has, symbols, and, notational, conventions, quite, independent, of, print, music, notation, it, is, linear, in, nature, similar, to, a, printed, language, and, different, from, the, two, dimensional, nature, of, standard, printed, music, notation, to, a, degree, braille, music, resembles, musical, markup, languages, such, as, musicxml, or, niff, in, integer, notation, or, the, integer, model, of, pitch, all, pitch, classes, and, intervals, between, pitch, classes, are, designated, using, the, numbers, 0, through, 11, the, standard, form, of, rap, notation, is, the, flow, diagram, where, rappers, line, up, their, lyrics, underneath, beat, numbers, hip, hop, scholars, also, make, use, of, the, same, flow, diagrams, that, rappers, use, the, books, how, to, rap, and, how, to, rap, 2, extensively, use, the, diagrams, to, explain, rap, s, triplets, flams, rests, rhyme, schemes, runs, of, rhyme, and, breaking, rhyme, patterns, among, other, techniques, similar, systems, are, used, by, musicologists, adam, krims, in, his, book, rap, music, and, the, poetics, of, identity, and, kyle, adams, in, his, work, on, rap, s, flow, as, rap, usually, revolves, around, a, strong, 4, 4, beat, with, certain, syllables, aligned, to, the, beat, all, the, notational, systems, have, a, similar, structure, they, all, have, four, beat, numbers, at, the, top, of, the, diagram, so, that, syllables, can, be, written, in, line, with, the, beat, it, is, being, used, for, six, hole, woodwind, instruments, basically, for, irish, folk, songs, tin, whistle, tabs, are, particularly, useful, for, those, unfamiliar, with, sheet, music, notation, the, musical, symbols, unicode, block, encodes, an, extensive, system, of, formal, musical, notation, the, miscellaneous, symbols, block, has, a, few, of, the, more, common, symbols, the, miscellaneous, symbols, and, pictographs, block, has, three, emoji, that, may, include, depictions, of, musical, notes, various, computer, programs, have, been, developed, for, creating, music, notation, called, scorewriters, or, music, notation, software, music, may, also, be, stored, in, various, digital, file, formats, for, purposes, other, than, graphic, notation, output, according, to, philip, tagg, and, richard, middleton, musicology, and, to, a, degree, european, influenced, musical, practice, suffer, from, a, notational, centricity, a, methodology, slanted, by, the, characteristics, of, notation, a, variety, of, 20th, and, 21st, century, composers, have, dealt, with, this, problem, either, by, adapting, standard, western, musical, notation, or, by, using, graphic, notation, these, include, george, crumb, luciano, berio, krzystof, penderecki, earl, brown, john, cage, witold, lutoslawski, and, others
