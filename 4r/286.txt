language, it, is, regarded, as, a, literary, masterpiece, and, definitive, of, the, ethno, national, cultural, identity, of, iran, ferdowsi, started, writing, the, shahnameh, in, 977, and, completed, it, on, 8, march, 1010, the, shahnameh, is, a, monument, of, poetry, and, historiography, being, mainly, the, poetical, recast, of, what, ferdowsi, his, contemporaries, and, his, predecessors, regarded, as, the, account, of, iran, s, ancient, history, many, such, accounts, already, existed, in, prose, an, example, being, the, shahnameh, of, abu, mansur, a, small, portion, of, ferdowsi, s, work, in, passages, scattered, throughout, the, shahnameh, is, entirely, of, his, own, conception, the, shahnameh, is, an, epic, poem, of, over, 50, 000, couplets, written, in, early, new, persian, it, is, based, mainly, on, a, prose, work, of, the, same, name, compiled, in, ferdowsi, s, earlier, life, in, his, native, tus, this, prose, shahnameh, was, in, turn, and, for, the, most, part, the, translation, of, a, pahlavi, middle, persian, work, known, as, the, khwad, y, n, mag, book, of, kings, a, late, sasanian, compilation, of, the, history, of, the, kings, and, heroes, of, persia, from, mythical, times, down, to, the, reign, of, khosrow, ii, 590, 628, the, khwad, y, n, mag, contained, historical, information, on, the, later, sasanian, period, but, it, does, not, appear, to, have, drawn, on, any, historical, sources, for, the, earlier, sasanian, period, 3rd, to, 4th, centuries, ferdowsi, added, material, continuing, the, story, to, the, overthrow, of, the, sasanians, by, the, muslim, armies, in, the, middle, of, the, seventh, century, the, first, to, undertake, the, versification, of, the, pahlavi, chronicle, was, daqiqi, a, contemporary, of, ferdowsi, poet, at, the, court, of, the, samanid, empire, who, came, to, a, violent, end, after, completing, only, 1, 000, verses, these, verses, which, deal, with, the, rise, of, the, prophet, zoroaster, were, afterward, incorporated, by, ferdowsi, with, acknowledgment, in, his, own, poem, the, style, of, the, shahnameh, shows, characteristics, of, both, written, and, oral, literature, some, claim, that, ferdowsi, also, used, zoroastrian, nasks, such, as, the, now, lost, chihrdad, as, sources, as, well, many, other, pahlavi, sources, were, used, in, composing, the, epic, prominent, being, the, kar, namag, i, ardashir, i, pabagan, which, was, originally, written, during, the, late, sassanid, era, and, gave, accounts, of, how, ardashir, i, came, to, power, which, because, of, its, historical, proximity, is, thought, to, be, highly, accurate, the, text, is, written, in, the, late, middle, persian, which, was, the, immediate, ancestor, of, modern, persian, a, great, portion, of, the, historical, chronicles, given, in, shahnameh, is, based, on, this, epic, and, there, are, in, fact, various, phrases, and, words, which, can, be, matched, between, ferdowsi, s, poem, and, this, source, according, to, zabihollah, safa, traditional, historiography, in, iran, holds, that, ferdowsi, was, grieved, by, the, fall, of, the, sasanian, empire, and, its, subsequent, rule, by, arabs, and, turks, the, shahnameh, the, argument, goes, is, largely, his, effort, to, preserve, the, memory, of, persia, s, golden, days, and, transmit, it, to, a, new, generation, so, that, by, learning, from, it, they, could, acquire, the, knowledge, needed, to, build, a, better, world, although, most, scholars, have, contended, that, ferdowsi, s, main, concern, was, the, preservation, of, the, pre, islamic, legacy, of, myth, and, history, a, number, of, authors, have, formally, challenged, this, view, this, portion, of, the, shahnameh, is, relatively, short, amounting, to, some, 2100, verses, or, four, percent, of, the, entire, book, and, it, narrates, events, with, the, simplicity, predictability, and, swiftness, of, a, historical, work, after, an, opening, in, praise, of, god, and, wisdom, the, shahnameh, gives, an, account, of, the, creation, of, the, world, and, of, man, as, believed, by, the, sasanians, this, introduction, is, followed, by, the, story, of, the, first, man, keyumars, who, also, became, the, first, king, after, a, period, of, mountain, dwelling, his, grandson, hushang, son, of, siamak, accidentally, discovered, fire, and, established, the, sadeh, feast, in, its, honor, stories, of, tahmuras, jamshid, zahhak, kawa, or, kaveh, fereydun, and, his, three, sons, salm, tur, and, iraj, and, his, grandson, manuchehr, are, related, in, this, section, almost, two, thirds, of, the, shahnameh, are, devoted, to, the, age, of, heroes, extending, from, manuchehr, s, reign, until, the, conquest, of, alexander, the, great, this, age, is, also, identified, as, the, kingdom, of, the, kayanians, which, established, a, long, history, of, heroic, age, in, which, myth, and, legend, are, combined, the, main, feature, of, this, period, is, the, major, role, played, by, the, saka, or, sistani, heroes, who, appear, as, the, backbone, of, the, empire, garshasp, is, briefly, mentioned, with, his, son, nariman, whose, own, son, sam, acted, as, the, leading, paladin, of, manuchehr, while, reigning, in, sistan, in, his, own, right, his, successors, were, his, son, zal, and, zal, s, son, rostam, the, bravest, of, the, brave, and, then, faramarz, among, the, stories, described, in, this, section, are, the, romance, of, zal, and, rudaba, the, seven, stages, or, labors, of, rostam, rostam, and, sohrab, siyavash, and, sudaba, rostam, and, akvan, div, the, romance, of, bijan, and, manijeh, the, wars, with, afrasiab, daqiqi, s, account, of, the, story, of, goshtasp, and, arjasp, and, rostam, and, esfandyar, a, brief, mention, of, the, arsacid, dynasty, follows, the, history, of, alexander, and, precedes, that, of, ardashir, i, founder, of, the, sasanian, empire, after, this, sasanian, history, is, related, with, a, good, deal, of, accuracy, the, fall, of, the, sassanids, and, the, arab, conquest, of, persia, are, narrated, romantically, according, to, jalal, khaleghi, mutlaq, the, shahnameh, teaches, a, wide, variety, of, moral, virtues, like, worship, of, one, god, religious, uprightness, patriotism, love, of, wife, family, and, children, and, helping, the, poor, there, are, themes, in, the, shahnameh, that, were, viewed, with, suspicion, by, the, succession, of, iranian, regimes, during, the, reign, of, mohammad, reza, shah, the, epic, was, largely, ignored, in, favor, of, the, more, abstruse, esoteric, and, dryly, intellectual, persian, literature, historians, note, that, the, theme, of, regicide, and, the, incompetence, of, kings, embedded, in, the, epic, did, not, sit, well, with, the, iranian, monarchy, later, there, were, muslim, figures, such, as, ali, shariati, the, hero, of, islamic, reformist, youth, of, the, 1970s, who, were, also, antagonistic, towards, the, contents, of, the, shahnameh, since, it, included, verses, critical, of, islam, these, include, the, line, tofu, bar, to, ey, charkh, i, gardun, tofu, spit, on, your, face, oh, heavens, spit, which, ferdowsi, used, as, a, reference, to, the, muslim, invaders, who, despoiled, zoroastrianism, after, the, shahnameh, a, number, of, other, works, similar, in, nature, surfaced, over, the, centuries, within, the, cultural, sphere, of, the, persian, language, without, exception, all, such, works, were, based, in, style, and, method, on, the, shahnameh, but, none, of, them, could, quite, achieve, the, same, degree, of, fame, and, popularity, some, experts, believe, the, main, reason, the, modern, persian, language, today, is, more, or, less, the, same, language, as, that, of, ferdowsi, s, time, over, 1000, years, ago, is, due, to, the, very, existence, of, works, like, the, shahnameh, which, have, had, lasting, and, profound, cultural, and, linguistic, influence, in, other, words, the, shahnameh, itself, has, become, one, of, the, main, pillars, of, the, modern, persian, language, studying, ferdowsi, s, masterpiece, also, became, a, requirement, for, achieving, mastery, of, the, persian, language, by, subsequent, persian, poets, as, evidenced, by, numerous, references, to, the, shahnameh, in, their, works, although, 19th, century, british, iranologist, e, g, browne, has, claimed, that, ferdowsi, purposefully, avoided, arabic, vocabulary, this, claim, has, been, challenged, by, modern, scholarship, specifically, mohammed, moinfar, who, has, noted, that, there, are, numerous, examples, of, arabic, words, in, the, shahnameh, which, are, effectively, synonyms, for, persian, words, previously, used, in, the, text, this, calls, into, question, the, idea, of, ferdowsi, s, deliberate, eschewing, of, arabic, words, the, shahnameh, has, 62, stories, 990, chapters, and, some, 50, 000, rhyming, couplets, making, it, more, than, three, times, the, length, of, homer, s, iliad, and, more, than, twelve, times, the, length, of, the, german, nibelungenlied, according, to, ferdowsi, himself, the, final, edition, of, the, shahnameh, contained, some, sixty, thousand, distichs, but, this, is, a, round, figure, most, of, the, relatively, reliable, manuscripts, have, preserved, a, little, over, fifty, thousand, distichs, nizami, aruzi, reports, that, the, final, edition, of, the, shahnameh, sent, to, the, court, of, sultan, mahmud, of, ghazni, was, prepared, in, seven, volumes, the, shirvanshah, dynasty, adopted, many, of, their, names, from, the, shahnameh, the, relationship, between, shirvanshah, and, his, son, manuchihr, is, mentioned, in, chapter, eight, of, nizami, s, layla, and, majnun, nizami, advises, the, king, s, son, to, read, the, shahnameh, and, to, remember, the, meaningful, sayings, of, the, wise, according, to, the, turkish, historian, mehmet, fuat, k, pr, l, indeed, despite, all, claims, to, the, contrary, there, is, no, question, that, persian, influence, was, paramount, among, the, seljuks, of, anatolia, this, is, clearly, revealed, by, the, fact, that, the, sultans, who, ascended, the, throne, after, ghiyath, al, din, kai, khusraw, i, assumed, titles, taken, from, ancient, persian, mythology, like, kai, khosrow, kay, k, vus, and, kai, kobad, and, that, ala, al, din, kai, qubad, i, had, some, passages, from, the, shahname, inscribed, on, the, walls, of, konya, and, sivas, when, we, take, into, consideration, domestic, life, in, the, konya, courts, and, the, sincerity, of, the, favor, and, attachment, of, the, rulers, to, persian, poets, and, persian, literature, then, this, fact, is, undeniable, shah, ismail, i, d, 1524, the, founder, of, the, safavid, dynasty, of, iran, was, also, deeply, influenced, by, the, persian, literary, tradition, particularly, by, the, shahnameh, which, probably, explains, the, fact, that, he, named, all, of, his, sons, after, shahnameh, characters, dickson, and, welch, suggest, that, ismail, s, sh, hn, ma, i, sh, h, was, intended, as, a, present, to, the, young, tahmasp, after, defeating, muhammad, shaybani, s, uzbeks, ismail, asked, hatefi, a, famous, poet, from, jam, khorasan, to, write, a, shahnameh, like, epic, about, his, victories, and, his, newly, established, dynasty, although, the, epic, was, left, unfinished, it, was, an, example, of, mathnawis, in, the, heroic, style, of, the, shahnameh, written, later, on, for, the, safavid, kings, the, shahnameh, s, influence, has, extended, beyond, the, persian, sphere, professor, victoria, arakelova, of, yerevan, university, states, during, the, ten, centuries, passed, after, firdausi, composed, his, monumental, work, heroic, legends, and, stories, of, shahnameh, have, remained, the, main, source, of, the, storytelling, for, the, peoples, of, this, region, persians, kurds, gurans, talishis, armenians, georgians, north, caucasian, peoples, etc, jamshid, giunashvili, remarks, on, the, connection, of, georgian, culture, with, that, of, shahnameh, the, names, of, many, h, n, ma, heroes, such, as, rostom, i, thehmine, sam, i, or, zaal, i, are, found, in, 11th, and, 12th, century, georgian, literature, they, are, indirect, evidence, for, an, old, georgian, translation, of, the, h, n, ma, that, is, no, longer, extant, the, h, n, ma, was, translated, not, only, to, satisfy, the, literary, and, aesthetic, needs, of, readers, and, listeners, but, also, to, inspire, the, young, with, the, spirit, of, heroism, and, georgian, patriotism, georgian, ideology, customs, and, worldview, often, informed, these, translations, because, they, were, oriented, toward, georgian, poetic, culture, conversely, georgians, consider, these, translations, works, of, their, native, literature, georgian, versions, of, the, h, n, ma, are, quite, popular, and, the, stories, of, rostam, and, sohr, b, or, b, jan, and, mani, a, became, part, of, georgian, folklore, farmanfarmaian, in, the, journal, of, persianate, studies, distinguished, scholars, of, persian, such, as, gvakharia, and, todua, are, well, aware, that, the, inspiration, derived, from, the, persian, classics, of, the, ninth, to, the, twelfth, centuries, produced, a, cultural, synthesis, which, saw, in, the, earliest, stages, of, written, secular, literature, in, georgia, the, resumption, of, literary, contacts, with, iran, much, stronger, than, before, gvakharia, 2001, p, 481, ferdowsi, s, shahnama, was, a, never, ending, source, of, inspiration, not, only, for, high, literature, but, for, folklore, as, well, almost, every, page, of, georgian, literary, works, and, chronicles, contains, names, of, iranian, heroes, borrowed, from, the, shahnama, ibid, ferdowsi, together, with, nez, mi, may, have, left, the, most, enduring, imprint, on, georgian, literature, despite, a, belief, held, by, some, the, turanian, of, shahnameh, whose, sources, are, based, on, avesta, and, pahlavi, texts, have, no, relationship, with, turks, the, turanians, of, the, shahnameh, are, an, iranian, people, representing, iranian, nomads, of, the, eurasian, steppes, and, have, no, relationship, to, the, culture, of, the, turks, turan, which, is, the, persian, name, for, the, areas, of, central, asia, beyond, the, oxus, up, to, the, 7th, century, where, the, story, of, the, shahnameh, ends, was, generally, an, iranian, speaking, land, according, to, richard, frye, the, extent, of, influence, of, the, iranian, epic, is, shown, by, the, turks, who, accepted, it, as, their, own, ancient, history, as, well, as, that, of, iran, the, turks, were, so, much, influenced, by, this, cycle, of, stories, that, in, the, eleventh, century, ad, we, find, the, qarakhanid, dynasty, in, central, asia, calling, itself, the, family, of, afrasiyab, and, so, it, is, known, in, the, islamic, history, turks, as, an, ethno, linguistic, group, have, been, influenced, by, the, shahnameh, since, advent, of, seljuks, the, seljuk, sultan, toghrul, iii, is, said, to, have, recited, the, shahnameh, while, swinging, his, mace, in, battle, according, to, ibn, bibi, 1221, the, seljuk, sultan, of, rum, ala, al, din, kay, kubad, decorated, the, walls, of, konya, and, sivas, with, verses, from, the, shahnameh, the, turks, themselves, connected, their, origin, not, with, turkish, tribal, history, but, with, the, turanians, of, shahnameh, specifically, in, india, through, the, shahnameh, they, felt, themselves, to, be, the, last, outpost, tied, to, the, civilized, world, by, the, thread, of, iranianism, ferdowsi, concludes, the, shahnameh, by, writing, i, ve, reached, the, end, of, this, great, history, and, all, the, land, will, talk, of, me, i, shall, not, die, these, seeds, i, ve, sown, will, save, my, name, and, reputation, from, the, grave, and, men, of, sense, and, wisdom, will, proclaim, when, i, have, gone, my, praises, and, my, fame, another, translation, of, by, reza, jamshidi, safa, much, i, have, suffered, in, these, thirty, years, i, have, revived, the, ajam, with, my, verse, i, will, not, die, then, alive, in, the, world, for, i, have, spread, the, seed, of, the, word, whoever, has, sense, path, and, faith, after, my, death, will, send, me, praise, many, persian, literary, figures, historians, and, biographers, have, praised, ferdowsi, and, the, shahnameh, the, shahnameh, is, considered, by, many, to, be, the, most, important, piece, of, work, in, persian, literature, western, writers, have, also, praised, the, shahnameh, and, persian, literature, in, general, persian, literature, has, been, considered, by, such, thinkers, as, goethe, as, one, of, the, four, main, bodies, of, world, literature, goethe, was, inspired, by, persian, literature, which, moved, him, to, write, his, west, eastern, divan, goethe, wrote, when, we, turn, our, attention, to, a, peaceful, civilized, people, the, persians, we, must, since, it, was, actually, their, poetry, that, inspired, this, work, go, back, to, the, earliest, period, to, be, able, to, understand, more, recent, times, it, will, always, seem, strange, to, the, historians, that, no, matter, how, many, times, a, country, has, been, conquered, subjugated, and, even, destroyed, by, enemies, there, is, always, a, certain, national, core, preserved, in, its, character, and, before, you, know, it, there, re, emerges, a, long, familiar, native, phenomenon, in, this, sense, it, would, be, pleasant, to, learn, about, the, most, ancient, persians, and, quickly, follow, them, up, to, the, present, day, at, an, all, the, more, free, and, steady, pace, sargozasht, nameh, or, biography, of, important, poets, and, writers, has, long, been, a, persian, tradition, some, of, the, biographies, of, ferdowsi, are, now, considered, apocryphal, nevertheless, this, shows, the, important, impact, he, had, in, the, persian, world, among, the, famous, biographies, are, famous, poets, of, persia, and, the, persian, tradition, have, praised, and, eulogized, ferdowsi, many, of, them, were, heavily, influenced, by, his, writing, and, used, his, genre, and, stories, to, develop, their, own, persian, epics, stories, and, poems, the, candle, of, the, wise, in, this, darkness, of, sorrow, the, pure, words, of, ferdowsi, of, the, tusi, are, such, his, pure, sense, is, an, angelic, birth, angelic, born, is, anyone, who, s, like, ferdowsi, how, sweetly, has, conveyed, the, pure, natured, ferdowsi, may, blessing, be, upon, his, pure, resting, place, do, not, harass, the, ant, that, s, dragging, a, seed, because, it, has, life, and, sweet, life, is, dear, many, other, poets, e, g, hafez, rumi, and, other, mystical, poets, have, used, imagery, of, shahnameh, heroes, in, their, poetry, the, shahnameh, s, impact, on, persian, historiography, was, immediate, and, some, historians, decorated, their, books, with, the, verses, of, shahnameh, below, is, sample, of, ten, important, historians, who, have, praised, the, shahnameh, and, ferdowsi, the, shahnameh, contains, the, first, persian, legend,
