the, garden, of, earthly, delights, dutch, de, tuin, der, lusten, lit, the, garden, of, lusts, is, the, modern, title, given, to, a, triptych, oil, painting, on, oak, panel, painted, by, the, early, netherlandish, master, hieronymus, bosch, between, 1490, and, 1510, when, bosch, was, between, 40, and, 60, years, old, it, has, been, housed, in, the, museo, del, prado, in, madrid, spain, since, 1939, as, little, is, known, of, bosch, s, life, or, intentions, interpretations, of, his, artistic, intent, behind, this, work, range, from, an, admonition, of, worldly, fleshy, indulgence, to, a, dire, warning, on, the, perils, of, life, s, temptations, to, an, evocation, of, ultimate, sexual, joy, the, intricacy, of, its, symbolism, particularly, that, of, the, central, panel, has, led, to, a, wide, range, of, scholarly, interpretations, over, the, centuries, twentieth, century, art, historians, are, divided, as, to, whether, the, triptych, s, central, panel, is, a, moral, warning, or, a, panorama, of, the, paradise, lost, bosch, painted, three, large, triptychs, the, others, are, the, last, judgment, of, c, 1482, and, the, haywain, triptych, of, c, 1516, that, can, be, read, from, left, to, right, and, in, which, each, panel, was, essential, to, the, meaning, of, the, whole, each, of, these, three, works, presents, distinct, yet, linked, themes, addressing, history, and, faith, triptychs, from, this, period, were, generally, intended, to, be, read, sequentially, the, left, and, right, panels, often, portraying, eden, and, the, last, judgment, respectively, while, the, main, subject, was, contained, in, the, centerpiece, it, is, not, known, whether, the, garden, was, intended, as, an, altarpiece, but, the, general, view, is, that, the, extreme, subject, matter, of, the, inner, center, and, right, panels, make, it, unlikely, that, it, was, intended, to, function, in, a, church, or, monastery, but, was, instead, commissioned, by, a, lay, patron, when, the, triptych, s, wings, are, closed, the, design, of, the, outer, panels, becomes, visible, rendered, in, a, green, gray, grisaille, these, panels, lack, colour, probably, because, most, netherlandish, triptychs, were, thus, painted, but, possibly, indicating, that, the, painting, reflects, a, time, before, the, creation, of, the, sun, and, moon, which, were, formed, according, to, christian, theology, to, give, light, to, the, earth, the, typical, grisaille, blandness, of, netherlandish, altarpieces, served, to, highlight, the, splendid, color, inside, the, outer, panels, are, generally, thought, to, depict, the, creation, of, the, world, showing, greenery, beginning, to, clothe, the, still, pristine, earth, god, wearing, a, crown, similar, to, a, papal, tiara, a, common, convention, in, netherlandish, painting, is, visible, as, a, tiny, figure, at, the, upper, left, bosch, shows, god, as, the, father, sitting, with, a, bible, on, his, lap, creating, the, earth, in, a, passive, manner, by, divine, fiat, above, him, is, inscribed, a, quote, from, psalm, 33, 9, reading, ipse, d, xit, et, facta, sunt, ipse, mand, vit, et, cre, ta, sunt, for, he, spoke, and, it, was, done, he, commanded, and, it, stood, fast, there, is, a, firmament, around, the, earth, in, reference, to, genesis, 1, 7, it, hangs, suspended, in, the, cosmos, which, is, shown, as, an, impermeable, darkness, whose, only, other, inhabitant, is, god, himself, despite, the, presence, of, vegetation, the, earth, does, not, yet, contain, human, or, animal, life, indicating, that, the, scene, represents, the, events, of, the, biblical, third, day, bosch, renders, the, plant, life, in, an, unusual, fashion, using, uniformly, gray, tints, which, make, it, difficult, to, determine, whether, the, subjects, are, purely, vegetal, or, perhaps, include, some, mineral, formations, surrounding, the, interior, of, the, globe, is, the, sea, partially, illuminated, by, beams, of, light, shining, through, clouds, the, exterior, wings, have, a, clear, position, within, the, sequential, narrative, of, the, work, as, a, whole, they, show, an, unpopulated, earth, composed, solely, of, rock, and, plants, contrasting, sharply, with, the, inner, central, panel, which, contains, an, earth, teeming, with, lust, humanity, scholars, have, proposed, that, bosch, used, the, outer, panels, to, establish, a, biblical, setting, for, the, inner, elements, of, the, work, and, the, exterior, image, is, generally, interpreted, as, set, in, an, earlier, time, than, those, in, the, interior, as, with, bosch, s, haywain, triptych, the, inner, centerpiece, is, flanked, by, heavenly, and, hellish, imagery, the, scenes, depicted, in, the, triptych, are, thought, to, follow, a, chronological, order, flowing, from, left, to, right, they, represent, eden, the, garden, of, earthly, delights, and, hell, god, appears, as, the, creator, of, humanity, in, the, left, hand, wing, while, the, consequences, of, humanity, s, failure, to, follow, his, will, are, shown, in, the, right, however, in, contrast, to, bosch, s, two, other, complete, triptychs, the, last, judgment, around, 1482, and, the, haywain, after, 1510, god, is, absent, from, the, central, panel, instead, this, panel, shows, humanity, acting, with, apparent, free, will, as, naked, men, and, women, engage, in, various, pleasure, seeking, activities, according, to, some, interpretations, the, right, hand, panel, is, believed, to, show, god, s, penalties, in, a, hellscape, art, historian, charles, de, tolnay, believed, that, through, the, seductive, gaze, of, adam, the, left, panel, already, shows, god, s, waning, influence, upon, the, newly, created, earth, this, view, is, reinforced, by, the, rendering, of, god, in, the, outer, panels, as, a, tiny, figure, in, comparison, to, the, immensity, of, the, earth, according, to, hans, belting, the, three, inner, panels, seek, to, broadly, convey, the, old, testament, notion, that, before, the, fall, there, was, no, defined, boundary, between, good, and, evil, humanity, in, its, innocence, was, unaware, of, consequence, the, left, panel, sometimes, known, as, the, joining, of, adam, and, eve, depicts, a, scene, from, the, paradise, of, the, garden, of, eden, commonly, interpreted, as, the, moment, when, god, presents, eve, to, adam, the, painting, shows, adam, waking, from, a, deep, sleep, to, find, god, holding, eve, by, her, wrist, and, giving, the, sign, of, his, blessing, to, their, union, god, is, younger, looking, than, on, the, outer, panels, blue, eyed, and, with, golden, curls, his, youthful, appearance, may, be, a, device, by, the, artist, to, illustrate, the, concept, of, christ, as, the, incarnation, of, the, word, of, god, god, s, right, hand, is, raised, in, blessing, while, he, holds, eve, s, wrist, with, his, left, according, to, the, work, s, most, controversial, interpreter, the, 20th, century, folklorist, and, art, historian, wilhelm, fraenger, as, though, enjoying, the, pulsation, of, the, living, blood, and, as, though, too, he, were, setting, a, seal, on, the, eternal, and, immutable, communion, between, this, human, blood, and, his, own, this, physical, contact, between, the, creator, and, eve, is, repeated, even, more, noticeably, in, the, way, adam, s, toes, touch, the, lord, s, foot, here, is, the, stressing, of, a, rapport, adam, seems, indeed, to, be, stretching, to, his, full, length, to, make, contact, with, the, creator, and, the, billowing, out, of, the, cloak, around, the, creator, s, heart, from, where, the, garment, falls, in, marked, folds, and, contours, to, adam, s, feet, also, seems, to, indicate, that, here, a, current, of, divine, power, flows, down, so, that, this, group, of, three, actually, forms, a, closed, circuit, a, complex, of, magical, energy, eve, avoids, adam, s, gaze, although, according, to, walter, s, gibson, she, is, shown, seductively, presenting, her, body, to, adam, adam, s, expression, is, one, of, amazement, and, fraenger, has, identified, three, elements, to, his, seeming, astonishment, firstly, there, is, surprise, at, the, presence, of, the, god, secondly, he, is, reacting, to, an, awareness, that, eve, is, of, the, same, nature, as, himself, and, has, been, created, from, his, own, body, finally, from, the, intensity, of, adam, s, gaze, it, can, be, concluded, that, he, is, experiencing, sexual, arousal, for, the, first, time, the, surrounding, landscape, is, populated, by, hut, shaped, forms, some, of, which, are, made, from, stone, while, others, are, at, least, partially, organic, behind, eve, rabbits, symbolising, fecundity, play, in, the, grass, and, a, dragon, tree, opposite, is, thought, to, represent, eternal, life, the, background, reveals, several, animals, that, would, have, been, exotic, to, contemporaneous, europeans, including, a, giraffe, a, monkey, riding, an, elephant, and, a, lion, that, has, killed, and, is, about, to, devour, his, prey, in, the, foreground, from, a, large, hole, in, the, ground, emerge, birds, and, winged, animals, some, of, which, are, realistic, some, fantastic, behind, a, fish, a, person, clothed, in, a, short, sleeved, hooded, jacket, and, with, a, duck, s, beak, holds, an, open, book, as, if, reading, to, the, left, of, the, area, a, cat, holds, a, small, lizard, like, creature, in, its, jaws, belting, observes, that, although, the, creatures, in, the, foreground, are, fantastical, imaginings, many, of, the, animals, in, the, mid, and, background, are, drawn, from, contemporary, travel, literature, and, here, bosch, is, appealing, to, the, knowledge, of, a, humanistic, and, aristocratic, readership, erhard, reuwich, s, pictures, for, bernhard, von, breydenbach, s, 1486, pilgrimages, to, the, holy, land, were, long, thought, to, be, the, source, for, both, the, elephant, and, the, giraffe, though, more, recent, research, indicates, the, mid, 15th, century, humanist, scholar, cyriac, of, ancona, s, travelogues, served, as, bosch, s, exposure, to, these, exotic, animals, according, to, art, historian, virginia, tuttle, the, scene, is, highly, unconventional, cannot, be, identified, as, any, of, the, events, from, the, book, of, genesis, traditionally, depicted, in, western, art, some, of, the, images, contradict, the, innocence, expected, in, the, garden, of, eden, tuttle, and, other, critics, have, interpreted, the, gaze, of, adam, upon, his, wife, as, lustful, and, indicative, of, the, christian, belief, that, humanity, was, doomed, from, the, beginning, gibson, believes, that, adam, s, facial, expression, betrays, not, just, surprise, but, also, expectation, according, to, a, belief, common, in, the, middle, ages, before, the, fall, adam, and, eve, would, have, copulated, without, lust, solely, to, reproduce, many, believed, that, the, first, sin, committed, after, eve, tasted, the, forbidden, fruit, was, carnal, lust, on, a, tree, to, the, right, a, snake, curls, around, a, tree, trunk, while, to, its, right, a, mouse, creeps, according, to, fraenger, both, animals, are, universal, phallic, symbols, the, skyline, of, the, center, panel, 220, 195, cm, 87, 77, in, matches, exactly, with, that, of, the, left, wing, while, the, positioning, of, its, central, pool, and, the, lake, behind, it, echoes, the, lake, in, the, earlier, scene, the, center, image, depicts, the, expansive, garden, landscape, which, gives, the, triptych, its, name, the, panel, shares, a, common, horizon, with, the, left, wing, suggesting, a, spatial, connection, between, the, two, scenes, the, garden, is, teeming, with, male, and, female, nudes, together, with, various, animals, plants, and, fruits, the, setting, is, not, the, paradise, shown, in, the, left, panel, nor, is, it, based, in, the, terrestrial, realm, fantastic, creatures, mingle, with, the, real, otherwise, ordinary, fruits, appear, engorged, to, a, gigantic, size, the, figures, are, engaged, in, diverse, amorous, sports, and, activities, both, in, couples, and, in, groups, gibson, describes, them, as, behaving, overtly, and, without, shame, while, art, historian, laurinda, dixon, writes, that, the, human, figures, exhibit, a, certain, adolescent, sexual, curiosity, many, of, the, numerous, human, figures, revel, in, an, innocent, self, absorbed, joy, as, they, engage, in, a, wide, range, of, activities, some, appear, to, enjoy, sensory, pleasures, others, play, unselfconsciously, in, the, water, and, yet, others, cavort, in, meadows, with, a, variety, of, animals, seemingly, at, one, with, nature, in, the, middle, of, the, background, a, large, blue, globe, resembling, a, fruit, pod, rises, in, the, middle, of, a, lake, visible, through, its, circular, window, there, is, a, man, holding, his, right, hand, close, to, his, partner, s, genitals, and, the, bare, buttocks, of, yet, another, figure, hovering, in, the, vicinity, according, to, fraenger, the, eroticism, of, the, center, frame, could, be, considered, either, as, an, allegory, of, spiritual, transition, or, a, playground, of, corruption, on, the, right, hand, side, of, the, foreground, there, is, a, group, of, four, figures, standing, three, white, and, one, black, skinned, the, white, skinned, figures, two, males, and, one, female, are, covered, from, head, to, foot, in, light, brown, body, hair, scholars, generally, agree, that, these, hirsute, figures, represent, wild, or, primeval, humanity, but, disagree, on, the, symbolism, of, their, inclusion, art, historian, patrik, reutersw, rd, for, example, posits, that, they, may, be, seen, as, the, noble, savage, who, represents, an, imagined, alternative, to, our, civilized, life, imbuing, the, panel, with, a, more, clear, cut, primitivistic, note, writer, peter, glum, in, contrast, sees, the, figures, as, intrinsically, connected, with, whoredom, and, lust, in, a, cave, to, their, lower, right, a, male, figure, points, towards, a, reclining, female, who, is, also, covered, in, hair, the, pointing, man, is, the, only, clothed, figure, in, the, panel, and, as, fraenger, observes, he, is, clothed, with, emphatic, austerity, right, up, to, his, throat, in, addition, he, is, one, of, the, few, human, figures, with, dark, hair, according, to, fraenger, the, way, this, man, s, dark, hair, grows, with, the, sharp, dip, in, the, middle, of, his, high, forehead, as, though, concentrating, there, all, the, energy, of, the, masculine, m, makes, his, face, different, from, all, the, others, his, coal, black, eyes, are, rigidly, focused, in, a, gaze, that, expresses, compelling, force, the, nose, is, unusually, long, and, boldly, curved, the, mouth, is, wide, and, sensual, but, the, lips, are, firmly, shut, in, a, straight, line, the, corners, strongly, marked, and, tightened, into, final, points, and, this, strengthens, the, impression, already, suggested, by, the, eyes, of, a, strong, controlling, will, it, is, an, extraordinarily, fascinating, face, reminding, us, of, faces, of, famous, men, especially, of, machiavelli, s, and, indeed, the, whole, aspect, of, the, head, suggests, something, mediterranean, as, though, this, man, had, acquired, his, frank, searching, superior, air, at, italian, academies, the, pointing, man, has, variously, been, described, as, either, the, patron, of, the, work, fraenger, in, 1947, as, an, advocate, of, adam, denouncing, eve, dirk, bax, in, 1956, as, saint, john, the, baptist, in, his, camel, s, skin, isabel, mateo, gom, z, in, 1963, or, as, a, self, portrait, the, woman, below, him, lies, within, a, semicylindrical, transparent, shield, while, her, mouth, is, sealed, devices, implying, that, she, bears, a, secret, to, their, left, a, man, crowned, by, leaves, lies, on, top, of, what, appears, to, be, an, actual, but, gigantic, strawberry, and, is, joined, by, a, male, and, female, who, contemplate, another, equally, huge, strawberry, there, is, no, perspectival, order, in, the, foreground, instead, it, comprises, a, series, of, small, motifs, wherein, proportion, and, terrestrial, logic, are, abandoned, bosch, presents, the, viewer, with, gigantic, ducks, playing, with, tiny, humans, under, cover, of, oversized, fruit, fish, walking, on, land, while, birds, dwell, in, the, water, a, passionate, couple, encased, in, an, amniotic, fluid, bubble, and, a, man, inside, of, a, red, fruit, staring, at, a, mouse, in, a, transparent, cylinder, the, pools, in, the, fore, and, background, contain, bathers, of, both, sexes, in, the, central, circular, pool, the, sexes, are, mostly, segregated, with, several, females, adorned, by, peacocks, and, fruit, four, women, carry, cherry, like, fruits, on, their, heads, perhaps, a, symbol, of, pride, at, the, time, as, has, been, deduced, from, the, contemporaneous, saying, don, t, eat, cherries, with, great, lords, they, ll, throw, the, pits, in, your, face, the, women, are, surrounded, by, a, parade, of, naked, men, riding, horses, donkeys, unicorns, camels, and, other, exotic, or, fantastic, creatures, several, men, show, acrobatics, while, riding, apparently, acts, designed, to, gain, the, females, attention, which, highlights, the, attraction, felt, between, the, two, sexes, as, groups, the, two, outer, springs, also, contain, both, men, and, women, cavorting, with, abandon, around, them, birds, infest, the, water, while, winged, fish, crawl, on, land, humans, inhabit, giant, shells, all, are, surrounded, by, oversized, fruit, pods, and, eggshells, and, both, humans, and, animals, feast, on, strawberries, and, cherries, the, impression, of, a, life, lived, without, consequence, or, what, art, historian, hans, belting, describes, as, unspoilt, and, pre, moral, existence, is, underscored, by, the, absence, of, children, and, old, people, according, to, the, second, and, third, chapters, of, genesis, adam, and, eve, s, children, were, born, after, they, were, expelled, from, eden, this, has, led, some, commentators, in, particular, belting, to, theorise, that, the, panel, represents, the, world, if, the, two, had, not, been, driven, out, among, the, thorns, and, thistles, of, the, world, in, fraenger, s, view, the, scene, illustrates, a, utopia, a, garden, of, divine, delight, before, the, fall, or, since, bosch, could, not, deny, the, existence, of, the, dogma, of, original, sin, a, millennial, condition, that, would, arise, if, after, expiation, of, original, sin, humanity, were, permitted, to, return, to, paradise, and, a, state, of, tranquil, harmony, embracing, all, creation, in, the, high, distance, of, the, background, above, the, hybrid, stone, formations, four, groups, of, people, and, creatures, are, seen, in, flight, on, the, immediate, left, a, human, male, rides, on, a, chthonic, solar, eagle, lion, the, human, carries, a, triple, branched, tree, of, life, on, which, perches, a, bird, according, to, fraenger, a, symbolic, bird, of, death, fraenger, believes, the, man, is, intended, to, represent, a, genius, he, is, the, symbol, of, the, extinction, of, the, duality, of, the, sexes, which, are, resolved, in, the, ether, into, their, original, state, of, unity, to, their, right, a, knight, with, a, dolphin, tail, sails, on, a, winged, fish, the, knight, s, tail, curls, back, to, touch, the, back, of, his, head, referencing, the, common, symbol, of, eternity, the, snake, biting, its, own, tail, on, the, immediate, right, of, the, panel, a, winged, youth, soars, upwards, carrying, a, fish, in, his, hands, and, a, falcon, on, his, back, according, to, belting, in, these, passages, bosch, s, imagination, triumphs, the, ambivalence, of, visual, syntax, exceeds, even, the, enigma, of, content, opening, up, that, new, dimension, of, freedom, by, which, painting, becomes, art, fraenger, titled, his, chapter, on, the, high, background, the, ascent, to, heaven, and, wrote, that, the, airborne, figures, were, likely, intended, as, a, link, between, what, is, above, and, what, is, below, just, as, the, left, and, right, hand, panels, represent, what, was, and, what, will, be, the, right, panel, 220, 97, 5, cm, 87, 38, 4, in, illustrates, hell, the, setting, of, a, number, of, bosch, paintings, bosch, depicts, a, world, in, which, humans, have, succumbed, to, temptations, that, lead, to, evil, and, reap, eternal, damnation, the, tone, of, this, final, panel, strikes, a, harsh, contrast, to, those, preceding, it, the, scene, is, set, at, night, and, the, natural, beauty, that, adorned, the, earlier, panels, is, noticeably, absent, compared, to, the, warmth, of, the, center, panel, the, right, wing, possesses, a, chilling, quality, rendered, through, cold, colourisation, and, frozen, waterways, and, presents, a, tableau, that, has, shifted, from, the, paradise, of, the, center, image, to, a, spectacle, of, cruel, torture, and, retribution, in, a, single, densely, detailed, scene, the, viewer, is, made, witness, to, cities, on, fire, in, the, background, war, torture, chambers, infernal, taverns, and, demons, in, the, midground, and, mutated, animals, feeding, on, human, flesh, in, the, foreground, the, nakedness, of, the, human, figures, has, lost, all, its, eroticism, and, many, now, attempt, to, cover, their, genitalia, and, breasts, with, their, hands, ashamed, by, their, nakedness, large, explosions, in, the, background, throw, light, through, the, city, gates, and, spill, into, the, water, in, the, midground, according, to, writer, walter, s, gibson, their, fiery, reflection, turning, the, water, below, into, blood, the, light, illuminates, a, road, filled, with, fleeing, figures, while, hordes, of, tormentors, prepare, to, burn, a, neighbouring, village, a, short, distance, away, a, rabbit, carries, an, impaled, and, bleeding, corpse, while, a, group, of, victims, above, are, thrown, into, a, burning, lantern, the, foreground, is, populated, by, various, distressed, or, tortured, figures, some, are, shown, vomiting, or, excreting, others, are, crucified, by, harp, and, lute, in, an, allegory, of, music, thus, sharpening, the, contrast, between, pleasure, and, torture, a, choir, sings, from, a, score, inscribed, on, a, pair, of, buttocks, part, of, a, group, that, has, been, described, as, the, musicians, hell, the, focal, point, of, the, scene, is, the, tree, man, whose, cavernous, torso, is, supported, by, what, could, be, contorted, arms, or, rotting, tree, trunks, his, head, supports, a, disk, populated, by, demons, and, victims, parading, around, a, huge, set, of, bagpipes, often, used, as, a, dual, sexual, symbol, reminiscent, of, human, scrotum, and, penis, the, tree, man, s, torso, is, formed, from, a, broken, eggshell, and, the, supporting, trunk, has, thorn, like, branches, which, pierce, the, fragile, body, a, grey, figure, in, a, hood, bearing, an, arrow, jammed, between, his, buttocks, climbs, a, ladder, into, the, tree, man, s, central, cavity, where, nude, men, sit, in, a, tavern, like, setting, the, tree, man, gazes, outwards, beyond, the, viewer, his, conspiratorial, expression, a, mix, of, wistfulness, and, resignation, belting, wondered, if, the, tree, man, s, face, is, a, self, portrait, citing, the, figure, s, expression, of, irony, and, the, slightly, sideways, gaze, then, constitute, the, signature, of, an, artist, who, claimed, a, bizarre, pictorial, world, for, his, own, personal, imagination, many, elements, in, the, panel, incorporate, earlier, iconographical, conventions, depicting, hell, however, bosch, is, innovative, in, that, he, describes, hell, not, as, a, fantastical, place, but, as, a, realistic, world, containing, many, elements, from, day, to, day, human, life, animals, are, shown, punishing, humans, subjecting, them, to, nightmarish, torments, that, may, symbolise, the, seven, deadly, sins, matching, the, torment, to, the, sin, sitting, on, an, object, that, may, be, a, toilet, or, a, throne, the, panel, s, centerpiece, is, a, gigantic, bird, headed, monster, feasting, on, human, corpses, which, he, excretes, through, a, cavity, below, him, into, the, transparent, chamber, pot, on, which, he, sits, the, monster, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, prince, of, hell, a, name, derived, from, the, cauldron, he, wears, on, his, head, perhaps, representing, a, debased, crown, at, his, feet, a, female, has, her, face, reflected, on, the, buttocks, of, a, demon, further, to, the, left, next, to, a, hare, headed, demon, a, group, of, naked, persons, around, a, toppled, gambling, table, are, being, massacred, with, swords, and, knives, other, brutal, violence, is, shown, by, a, knight, torn, down, and, eaten, up, by, a, pack, of, wolves, to, the, right, of, the, tree, man, during, the, middle, ages, sexuality, and, lust, were, seen, by, some, as, evidence, of, humanity, s, fall, from, grace, in, the, eyes, of, some, viewers, this, sin, is, depicted, in, the, left, hand, panel, through, adam, s, allegedly, lustful, gaze, toward, eve, and, it, has, been, proposed, that, the, center, panel, was, created, as, a, warning, to, the, viewer, to, avoid, a, life, of, sinful, pleasure, according, to, this, view, the, penalty, for, such, sins, is, shown, in, the, right, panel, of, the, triptych, in, the,

to, be, symbolised, by, the, gigantic, musical, instruments, and, by, the, choral, singers, in, the, left, foreground, of, the, panel, musical, instruments, often, carried, erotic, connotations, in, works, of, art, of, the, period, and, lust, was, referred, to, in, moralising, sources, as, the, music, of, the, flesh, there, has, also, been, the, view, that, bosch, s, use, of, music, here, might, be, a, rebuke, against, traveling, minstrels, often, thought, of, as, purveyors, of, bawdy, song, and, verse, the, dating, of, the, garden, of, earthly, delights, is, uncertain, ludwig, von, baldass, 1917, considered, the, painting, to, be, an, early, work, by, bosch, however, since, de, tolnay, 1937, consensus, among, 20th, century, art, historians, placed, the, work, in, 1503, 1504, or, even, later, both, early, and, late, datings, were, based, on, the, archaic, treatment, of, space, dendrochronology, dates, the, oak, of, the, panels, between, the, years, 1460, and, 1466, providing, the, earliest, date, terminus, post, quem, for, the, work, the, wood, used, for, panel, paintings, during, this, period, customarily, underwent, a, lengthy, period, of, storage, for, seasoning, purposes, so, the, age, of, the, oak, might, be, expected, to, predate, the, actual, date, of, the, painting, by, several, years, internal, evidence, specifically, the, depiction, of, a, pineapple, a, new, world, fruit, suggests, that, the, painting, itself, postdates, columbus, voyages, to, the, americas, between, 1492, and, 1504, the, dendrochronological, research, brought, vermet, to, reconsider, an, early, dating, and, consequently, to, dispute, the, presence, of, any, new, world, objects, stressing, the, presence, of, african, ones, instead, the, garden, was, first, documented, in, 1517, one, year, after, the, artist, s, death, when, antonio, de, beatis, a, canon, from, molfetta, italy, described, the, work, as, part, of, the, decoration, in, the, town, palace, of, the, counts, of, the, house, of, nassau, in, brussels, the, nassau, palace, the, palace, was, a, high, profile, location, a, house, often, visited, by, heads, of, state, and, leading, court, figures, the, prominence, of, the, painting, has, led, some, to, conclude, that, the, work, was, commissioned, and, not, solely, a, flight, of, the, imagination, a, description, of, the, triptych, in, 1605, called, it, the, strawberry, painting, because, the, fruit, of, the, strawberry, tree, madro, o, in, spanish, features, prominently, in, the, center, panel, early, spanish, writers, referred, to, the, work, as, la, lujuria, lust, the, aristocracy, of, the, burgundian, netherlands, influenced, by, the, humanist, movement, were, the, most, likely, collectors, of, bosch, s, paintings, but, there, are, few, records, of, the, location, of, his, works, in, the, years, immediately, following, his, death, it, is, probable, that, the, patron, of, the, work, was, engelbrecht, ii, of, nassau, who, died, in, 1504, or, his, successor, henry, iii, of, nassau, breda, the, governor, of, several, of, the, habsburg, provinces, in, the, low, countries, de, beatis, wrote, in, his, travel, journal, that, there, are, some, panels, on, which, bizarre, things, have, been, painted, they, represent, seas, skies, woods, meadows, and, many, other, things, such, as, people, crawling, out, of, a, shell, others, that, bring, forth, birds, men, and, women, white, and, blacks, doing, various, activities, and, poses, because, the, triptych, was, publicly, displayed, in, the, palace, of, the, house, of, nassau, it, was, visible, to, many, and, bosch, s, reputation, and, fame, quickly, spread, across, europe, the, work, s, popularity, can, be, measured, by, the, numerous, surviving, copies, in, oil, engraving, and, tapestry, commissioned, by, wealthy, patrons, as, well, as, by, the, number, of, forgeries, in, circulation, after, his, death, most, are, of, the, central, panel, only, and, do, not, deviate, from, the, original, these, copies, were, usually, painted, on, a, much, smaller, scale, and, they, vary, considerably, in, quality, many, were, created, a, generation, after, bosch, and, some, took, the, form, of, wall, tapestries, the, de, beatis, description, only, rediscovered, by, steppe, in, the, 1960s, cast, new, light, on, the, commissioning, of, a, work, that, was, previously, thought, since, it, has, no, central, religious, image, to, be, an, atypical, altarpiece, many, netherlandish, diptychs, intended, for, private, use, are, known, and, even, a, few, triptychs, but, the, bosch, panels, are, unusually, large, compared, with, these, and, contain, no, donor, portraits, possibly, they, were, commissioned, to, celebrate, a, wedding, as, large, italian, paintings, for, private, houses, frequently, were, nevertheless, the, garden, s, bold, depictions, do, not, rule, out, a, church, commission, such, as, the, contemporaneous, fervor, to, warn, against, immorality, in, 1566, the, triptych, served, as, the, model, for, a, tapestry, that, hangs, at, el, escorial, monastery, near, madrid, upon, the, death, of, henry, iii, the, painting, passed, into, the, hands, of, his, nephew, william, the, silent, the, founder, of, the, house, of, orange, nassau, and, leader, of, the, dutch, revolt, against, spain, in, 1568, however, the, duke, of, alba, confiscated, the, picture, and, brought, it, to, spain, where, it, became, the, property, of, one, don, fernando, the, duke, s, illegitimate, son, and, heir, and, the, spanish, commander, in, the, netherlands, philip, ii, acquired, the, painting, at, auction, in, 1591, two, years, later, he, presented, it, to, el, escorial, a, contemporaneous, description, of, the, transfer, records, the, gift, on, 8, july, 1593, of, a, painting, in, oils, with, two, wings, depicting, the, variety, of, the, world, illustrated, with, grotesqueries, by, hieronymus, bosch, known, as, del, madro, o, after, an, unbroken, 342, years, at, el, escorial, the, work, moved, to, the, museo, del, prado, in, 1939, along, with, other, works, by, bosch, the, triptych, was, not, particularly, well, preserved, the, paint, of, the, middle, panel, especially, had, flaked, off, around, joints, in, the, wood, however, recent, restoration, works, have, managed, to, recover, and, maintain, it, in, a, very, good, state, of, quality, and, preservation, the, painting, usually, is, on, display, in, a, room, with, other, works, by, bosch, little, is, known, for, sure, of, the, life, of, hieronymus, bosch, or, of, the, commissions, or, influences, that, may, have, formed, the, basis, for, the, iconography, of, his, work, his, birthdate, education, and, patrons, remain, unknown, there, is, no, surviving, record, of, bosch, s, thoughts, or, evidence, as, to, what, attracted, and, inspired, him, to, such, an, individual, mode, of, expression, through, the, centuries, art, historians, have, struggled, to, resolve, this, question, yet, conclusions, remain, fragmentary, at, best, scholars, have, debated, bosch, s, iconography, more, extensively, than, that, of, any, other, netherlandish, artist, his, works, are, generally, regarded, as, enigmatic, leading, some, to, speculate, that, their, content, refers, to, contemporaneous, esoteric, knowledge, since, lost, to, history, although, bosch, s, career, flourished, during, the, high, renaissance, he, lived, in, an, area, where, the, beliefs, of, the, medieval, church, still, held, moral, authority, he, would, have, been, familiar, with, some, of, the, new, forms, of, expression, especially, those, in, southern, europe, although, it, is, difficult, to, attribute, with, certainty, which, artists, writers, and, conventions, had, a, bearing, on, his, work, jos, de, sig, enza, is, credited, with, the, first, extensive, critique, of, the, garden, of, earthly, delights, in, his, 1605, history, of, the, order, of, st, jerome, he, argued, against, dismissing, the, painting, as, either, heretical, or, merely, absurd, commenting, that, the, panels, are, a, satirical, comment, on, the, shame, and, sinfulness, of, mankind, the, art, historian, carl, justi, observed, that, the, left, and, center, panels, are, drenched, in, tropical, and, oceanic, atmosphere, and, concluded, that, bosch, was, inspired, by, the, news, of, recently, discovered, atlantis, and, by, drawings, of, its, tropical, scenery, just, as, columbus, himself, when, approaching, terra, firma, thought, that, the, place, he, had, found, at, the, mouth, of, the, orinoco, was, the, site, of, the, earthly, paradise, the, period, in, which, the, triptych, was, created, was, a, time, of, adventure, and, discovery, when, tales, and, trophies, from, the, new, world, sparked, the, imagination, of, poets, painters, and, writers, although, the, triptych, contains, many, unearthly, and, fantastic, creatures, bosch, still, appealed, in, his, images, and, cultural, references, to, an, elite, humanist, and, aristocratic, audience, bosch, reproduces, a, scene, from, martin, schongauer, s, engraving, flight, into, egypt, conquest, in, africa, and, the, east, provided, both, wonder, and, terror, to, european, intellectuals, as, it, led, to, the, conclusion, that, eden, could, never, have, been, an, actual, geographical, location, the, garden, references, exotic, travel, literature, of, the, 15th, century, through, the, animals, including, lions, and, a, giraffe, in, the, left, panel, the, giraffe, has, been, traced, to, cyriac, of, ancona, a, travel, writer, known, for, visiting, egypt, during, the, 1440s, the, exoticism, of, cyriac, s, sumptuous, manuscripts, may, have, inspired, bosch, s, imagination, the, charting, and, conquest, of, this, new, world, made, real, regions, previously, only, idealised, in, the, imagination, of, artists, and, poets, at, the, same, time, the, certainty, of, the, old, biblical, paradise, began, to, slip, from, the, grasp, of, thinkers, into, the, realms, of, mythology, in, response, treatment, of, the, paradise, in, literature, poetry, and, art, shifted, towards, a, self, consciously, fictional, utopian, representation, as, exemplified, by, the, writings, of, thomas, more, 1478, 1535, albrecht, d, rer, was, an, avid, student, of, exotic, animals, and, drew, many, sketches, based, on, his, visits, to, european, zoos, d, rer, visited, s, hertogenbosch, during, bosch, s, lifetime, and, it, is, likely, the, two, artists, met, and, that, bosch, drew, inspiration, from, the, german, s, work, attempts, to, find, sources, for, the, work, in, literature, from, the, period, have, not, been, successful, art, historian, erwin, panofsky, wrote, in, 1953, in, spite, of, all, the, ingenious, erudite, and, in, part, extremely, useful, research, devoted, to, the, task, of, decoding, jerome, bosch, i, cannot, help, feeling, that, the, real, secret, of, his, magnificent, nightmares, and, daydreams, has, still, to, be, disclosed, we, have, bored, a, few, holes, through, the, door, of, the, locked, room, but, somehow, we, do, not, seem, to, have, discovered, the, key, the, humanist, desiderius, erasmus, has, been, suggested, as, a, possible, influence, the, writer, lived, in, s, hertogenbosch, in, the, 1480s, and, it, is, likely, he, knew, bosch, glum, remarked, on, the, triptych, s, similarity, of, tone, with, erasmus, s, view, that, theologians, explain, to, suit, themselves, the, most, difficult, mysteries, is, it, a, possible, proposition, god, the, father, hates, the, son, could, god, have, assumed, the, form, of, a, woman, a, devil, an, ass, a, gourd, a, stone, because, only, bare, details, are, known, of, bosch, s, life, interpretation, of, his, work, can, be, an, extremely, difficult, area, for, academics, as, it, is, largely, reliant, on, conjecture, individual, motifs, and, elements, of, symbolism, may, be, explained, but, so, far, relating, these, to, each, other, and, his, work, as, a, whole, has, remained, elusive, the, enigmatic, scenes, depicted, on, the, panels, of, the, inner, triptych, of, the, garden, of, earthly, delights, have, been, studied, by, many, scholars, who, have, often, arrived, at, contradictory, interpretations, analyses, based, on, symbolic, systems, ranging, from, the, alchemical, astrological, and, heretical, to, the, folkloric, and, subconscious, have, all, attempted, to, explain, the, complex, objects, and, ideas, presented, in, the, work, until, the, early, 20th, century, bosch, s, paintings, were, generally, thought, to, incorporate, attitudes, of, medieval, didactic, literature, and, sermons, charles, de, tolnay, wrote, that, the, oldest, writers, dominicus, lampsonius, and, karel, van, mander, attached, themselves, to, his, most, evident, side, to, the, subject, their, conception, of, bosch, inventor, of, fantastic, pieces, of, devilry, and, infernal, scenes, which, prevails, today, 1937, in, the, public, at, large, and, prevailed, with, historians, until, the, last, quarter, of, the, 19th, century, generally, his, work, is, described, as, a, warning, against, lust, and, the, central, panel, as, a, representation, of, the, transience, of, worldly, pleasure, in, 1960, the, art, historian, ludwig, von, baldass, wrote, that, bosch, shows, how, sin, came, into, the, world, through, the, creation, of, eve, how, fleshly, lusts, spread, over, the, entire, earth, promoting, all, the, deadly, sins, and, how, this, necessarily, leads, straight, to, hell, de, tolnay, wrote, that, the, center, panel, represents, the, nightmare, of, humanity, where, the, artist, s, purpose, above, all, is, to, show, the, evil, consequences, of, sensual, pleasure, and, to, stress, its, ephemeral, character, supporters, of, this, view, hold, that, the, painting, is, a, sequential, narrative, depicting, mankind, s, initial, state, of, innocence, in, eden, followed, by, the, subsequent, corruption, of, that, innocence, and, finally, its, punishment, in, hell, at, various, times, in, its, history, the, triptych, has, been, known, as, la, lujuria, the, sins, of, the, world, and, the, wages, of, sin, proponents, of, this, idea, point, out, that, moralists, during, bosch, s, era, believed, that, it, was, woman, s, ultimately, eve, s, temptation, that, drew, men, into, a, life, of, lechery, and, sin, this, would, explain, why, the, women, in, the, center, panel, are, very, much, among, the, active, participants, in, bringing, about, the, fall, at, the, time, the, power, of, femininity, was, often, rendered, by, showing, a, female, surrounded, by, a, circle, of, males, a, late, 15th, century, engraving, by, israhel, van, meckenem, shows, a, group, of, men, prancing, ecstatically, around, a, female, figure, the, master, of, the, banderoles, s, 1460, work, the, pool, of, youth, similarly, shows, a, group, of, females, standing, in, a, space, surrounded, by, admiring, figures, this, line, of, reasoning, is, consistent, with, interpretations, of, bosch, s, other, major, moralising, works, which, hold, up, the, folly, of, man, the, death, and, the, miser, and, the, haywain, although, according, to, the, art, historian, walter, bosing, each, of, these, works, is, rendered, in, a, manner, that, is, difficult, to, believe, bosch, intended, to, condemn, what, he, painted, with, such, visually, enchanting, forms, and, colors, bosing, concludes, that, a, medieval, mindset, was, naturally, suspicious, of, material, beauty, in, any, form, and, that, the, sumptuousness, of, bosch, s, description, may, have, been, intended, to, convey, a, false, paradise, teeming, with, transient, beauty, in, 1947, wilhelm, fr, nger, argued, that, the, triptych, s, center, panel, portrays, a, joyous, world, when, mankind, will, experience, a, rebirth, of, the, innocence, enjoyed, by, adam, and, eve, before, their, fall, in, his, book, the, millennium, of, hieronymus, bosch, fr, nger, wrote, that, bosch, was, a, member, of, the, heretical, sect, known, as, the, adamites, who, was, also, known, as, the, homines, intelligentia, and, brethren, and, sisters, of, the, free, spirit, this, radical, group, active, in, the, area, of, the, rhine, and, the, netherlands, strove, for, a, form, of, spirituality, immune, from, sin, even, in, the, flesh, and, imbued, the, concept, of, lust, with, a, paradisical, innocence, fr, nger, believed, the, garden, of, earthly, delights, was, commissioned, by, the, order, s, grand, master, later, critics, have, agreed, that, because, of, their, obscure, complexity, bosch, s, altarpieces, may, well, have, been, commissioned, for, non, devotional, purposes, the, homines, intelligentia, cult, sought, to, regain, the, innocent, sexuality, enjoyed, by, adam, and, eve, before, the, fall, fr, nger, writes, that, the, figures, in, bosch, s, work, are, peacefully, frolicking, about, the, tranquil, garden, in, vegetative, innocence, at, one, with, animals, and, plants, and, the, sexuality, that, inspires, them, seems, to, be, pure, joy, pure, bliss, fr, nger, argued, against, the, notion, that, the, hellscape, shows, the, retribution, handed, down, for, sins, committed, in, the, center, panel, fr, nger, saw, the, figures, in, the, garden, as, peaceful, naive, and, innocent, in, expressing, their, sexuality, and, at, one, with, nature, in, contrast, those, being, punished, in, hell, comprise, musicians, gamblers, desecrators, of, judgment, and, punishment, examining, the, symbolism, in, bosch, s, art, the, freakish, riddles, the, irresponsible, phantasmagoria, of, an, ecstatic, fr, nger, concluded, that, his, interpretation, applied, to, bosch, s, three, altarpieces, only, the, garden, of, earthly, delights, the, temptation, of, saint, anthony, and, the, haywain, triptych, fr, nger, distinguished, these, pieces, from, the, artist, s, other, works, and, argued, that, despite, their, anti, cleric, polemic, they, were, nevertheless, all, altarpieces, probably, commissioned, for, the, devotional, purposes, of, a, mystery, cult, while, commentators, accept, fr, nger, s, analysis, as, astute, and, broad, in, scope, they, have, often, questioned, his, final, conclusions, these, are, regarded, by, many, scholars, as, hypotheses, only, and, built, on, an, unstable, foundation, and, what, can, only, be, conjecture, critics, argue, that, artists, during, this, period, painted, not, for, their, pleasure, but, for, commission, while, the, language, and, secularization, of, a, post, renaissance, mindset, projected, onto, bosch, would, have, been, alien, to, the, late, medieval, painter, fr, nger, s, thesis, stimulated, others, to, examine, the, garden, more, closely, writer, carl, linfert, also, senses, the, joyfulness, of, the, people, in, the, center, panel, but, rejects, fr, nger, s, assertion, that, the, painting, is, a, doctrinaire, work, espousing, the, guiltless, sexuality, of, the, adamite, sect, while, the, figures, engage, in, amorous, acts, without, any, suggestion, of, the, forbidden, linfert, points, to, the, elements, in, the, center, panel, suggesting, death, and, temporality, some, figures, turn, away, from, the, activity, seeming, to, lose, hope, in, deriving, pleasure, from, the, passionate, frolicking, of, their, cohorts, writing, in, 1969, e, h, gombrich, drew, on, a, close, reading, of, genesis, and, the, gospel, according, to, saint, matthew, to, suggest, that, the, central, panel, is, according, to, linfert, the, state, of, mankind, on, the, eve, of, the, flood, when, men, still, pursued, pleasure, with, no, thought, of, the, morrow, their, only, sin, the, unawareness, of, sin, a, 2016, study, has, put, the, spotlight, back, on, the, alleged, lack, of, scientific, foundation, of, fraenger, s, esoteric, interpretation, this, latest, study, definitively, departs, from, the, traditional, reading, which, chronologically, speaking, would, go, from, the, creation, of, the, world, flaps, closed, to, the, threat, of, hell, left, flap, open, on, the, viewer, s, right, via, paradise, lost, right, flap, open, on, our, left, and, pre, diluvian, earthly, life, central, panel, it, corroborates, as, a, starting, point, for, the, reading, of, this, triptych, the, contemporary, interpretation, of, jean, wirth, followed, by, fr, d, ric, elsig, and, hans, belting, that, of, the, vision, of, the, reality, of, an, infernal, present, so, the, open, triptych, should, be, read, chronologically, not, from, left, to, right, but, from, right, to, left, from, the, infernal, description, of, the, chaotic, dispersed, human, condition, left, panel, open, on, our, right, to, the, unity, rediscovered, in, the, reintegration, by, the, masculine, principle, of, the, feminine, principle, right, panel, open, on, our, left, passing, through, a, vast, ritual, of, transmutation, that, looks, like, a, nebula, aka, the, feast, of, metamorphoses, central, panel, what, s, more, the, thesis, is, put, forward, that, bosch, deliberately, inverted, the, physical, and, structural, layout, of, the, two, side, panels, the, pure, and, simple, retroversion, of, these, two, panels, is, the, only, way, of, restoring, the, triptych, to, its, original, spatio, temporal, coherence, by, re, establishing, a, chronological, reading, from, left, to, right, in, this, way, a, real, continuity, of, space, topography, style, and, colour, is, restored, between, the, two, side, panels, and, the, central, panel, moreover, the, three, pieces, of, this, triptych, now, behave, like, communicating, vessels, in, a, perpetual, vortex, like, movement, this, inversion, is, said, to, have, been, deliberately, created, by, hieronymus, bosch, to, blur, the, lines, of, his, pictorial, manifesto, which, was, originally, so, heterodox, and, subversive, not, to, say, heretical, in, the, eyes, of, the, roman, catholic, church, of, his, time, because, bosch, was, such, a, unique, and, visionary, artist, his, influence, has, not, spread, as, widely, as, that, of, other, major, painters, of, his, era, however, there, have, been, instances, of, later, artists, incorporating, elements, of, the, garden, of, earthly, delights, into, their, work, pieter, bruegel, the, elder, c, 1525, 1569, in, particular, directly, acknowledged, bosch, as, an, important, influence, and, inspiration, and, incorporated, many, elements, of, the, inner, right, panel, into, several, of, his, most, popular, works, bruegel, s, mad, meg, depicts, a, peasant, woman, leading, an, army, of, women, to, pillage, hell, while, his, the, triumph, of, death, c, 1562, echoes, the, monstrous, hellscape, of, the, garden, and, utilizes, according, to, the, royal, museum, of, fine, arts, antwerp, the, same, unbridled, imagination, and, the, fascinating, colours, while, the, italian, court, painter, giuseppe, arcimboldo, c, 1527, 1593, did, not, create, hellscapes, he, painted, a, body, of, strange, and, fantastic, vegetable, portraits, generally, heads, of, people, composed, of, plants, roots, webs, and, various, other, organic, matter, these, strange, portraits, rely, on, and, echo, a, motif, that, was, in, part, inspired, by, bosch, s, willingness, to, break, from, strict, and, faithful, representations, of, nature, david, teniers, the, younger, c, 1610, 1690, was, a, flemish, painter, who, quoted, both, bosch, and, bruegel, throughout, his, career, in, such, works, as, his, versions, of, the, temptation, of, st, anthony, the, rich, man, in, hell, and, his, version, of, mad, meg, during, the, early, 20th, century, bosch, s, work, enjoyed, a, popular, resurrection, the, early, surrealists, fascination, with, dreamscapes, the, autonomy, of, the, imagination, and, a, free, flowing, connection, to, the, unconscious, brought, about, a, renewed, interest, in, his, work, bosch, s, imagery, struck, a, chord, with, joan, mir, and, salvador, dal, in, particular, both, knew, his, paintings, firsthand, having, seen, the, garden, of, earthly, delights, in, the, museo, del, prado, and, both, regarded, him, as, an, art, historical, mentor, mir, s, the, tilled, field, contains, several, parallels, to, bosch, s, garden, similar, flocks, of, birds, pools, from, which, living, creatures, emerge, and, oversize, disembodied, ears, all, echo, the, dutch, master, s, work, dal, s, 1929, the, great, masturbator, is, similar, to, an, image, on, the, right, side, of, the, left, panel, of, bosch, s, garden, composed, of, rocks, bushes, and, little, animals, resembling, a, face, with, a, prominent, nose, and, long, eyelashes, when, andr, breton, wrote, his, first, surrealist, manifesto, in, 1924, his, historical, precedents, as, inclusions, named, only, gustave, moreau, georges, seurat, and, uccello, however, the, surrealist, movement, soon, rediscovered, bosch, and, bruegel, who, quickly, became, popular, among, the, surrealist, painters, ren, magritte, and, max, ernst, both, were, inspired, by, bosch, s, the, garden, of, earthly, delights
