poetry, from, the, greek, word, poiesis, making, is, a, form, of, literary, art, that, uses, aesthetic, and, often, rhythmic, qualities, of, language, to, evoke, meanings, in, addition, to, or, in, place, of, literal, or, surface, level, meanings, any, particular, instance, of, poetry, is, called, a, poem, and, is, written, by, a, poet, poets, use, a, variety, of, techniques, called, poetic, devices, such, as, assonance, alliteration, euphony, and, cacophony, onomatopoeia, rhythm, via, metre, and, sound, symbolism, to, produce, musical, or, incantatory, effects, most, poems, are, formatted, in, verse, a, series, or, stack, of, lines, on, a, page, which, follow, a, rhythmic, or, other, deliberate, pattern, for, this, reason, verse, has, also, become, a, synonym, a, metonym, for, poetry, poetry, has, a, long, and, varied, history, evolving, differentially, across, the, globe, it, dates, back, at, least, to, prehistoric, times, with, hunting, poetry, in, africa, and, to, panegyric, and, elegiac, court, poetry, of, the, empires, of, the, nile, niger, and, volta, river, valleys, some, of, the, earliest, written, poetry, in, africa, occurs, among, the, pyramid, texts, written, during, the, 25th, century, bce, the, earliest, surviving, western, asian, epic, poem, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, was, written, in, the, sumerian, language, early, poems, in, the, eurasian, continent, evolved, from, folk, songs, such, as, the, chinese, shijing, as, well, as, from, religious, hymns, the, sanskrit, rigveda, the, zoroastrian, gathas, the, hurrian, songs, and, the, hebrew, psalms, or, from, a, need, to, retell, oral, epics, as, with, the, egyptian, story, of, sinuhe, indian, epic, poetry, and, the, homeric, epics, the, iliad, and, the, odyssey, ancient, greek, attempts, to, define, poetry, such, as, aristotle, s, poetics, focused, on, the, uses, of, speech, in, rhetoric, drama, song, and, comedy, later, attempts, concentrated, on, features, such, as, repetition, verse, form, and, rhyme, and, emphasized, aesthetics, which, distinguish, poetry, from, the, format, of, more, objectively, informative, academic, or, typical, writing, which, is, known, as, prose, poetry, uses, forms, and, conventions, to, suggest, differential, interpretations, of, words, or, to, evoke, emotive, responses, the, use, of, ambiguity, symbolism, irony, and, other, stylistic, elements, of, poetic, diction, often, leaves, a, poem, open, to, multiple, interpretations, similarly, figures, of, speech, such, as, metaphor, simile, and, metonymy, establish, a, resonance, between, otherwise, disparate, images, a, layering, of, meanings, forming, connections, previously, not, perceived, kindred, forms, of, resonance, may, exist, between, individual, verses, in, their, patterns, of, rhyme, or, rhythm, some, poetry, types, are, unique, to, particular, cultures, and, genres, and, respond, to, characteristics, of, the, language, in, which, the, poet, writes, readers, accustomed, to, identifying, poetry, with, dante, goethe, mickiewicz, or, rumi, may, think, of, it, as, written, in, lines, based, on, rhyme, and, regular, meter, there, are, however, traditions, such, as, biblical, poetry, and, alliterative, verse, that, use, other, means, to, create, rhythm, and, euphony, much, modern, poetry, reflects, a, critique, of, poetic, tradition, testing, the, principle, of, euphony, itself, or, altogether, forgoing, rhyme, or, set, rhythm, poets, as, from, the, greek, makers, of, language, have, contributed, to, the, evolution, of, the, linguistic, expressive, and, utilitarian, qualities, of, their, languages, in, an, increasingly, globalized, world, poets, often, adapt, forms, styles, and, techniques, from, diverse, cultures, and, languages, a, western, cultural, tradition, extending, at, least, from, homer, to, rilke, associates, the, production, of, poetry, with, inspiration, often, by, a, muse, either, classical, or, contemporary, or, through, other, often, canonised, poets, work, which, sets, some, kind, of, example, or, challenge, in, first, person, poems, the, lyrics, are, spoken, by, an, i, a, character, who, may, be, termed, the, speaker, distinct, from, the, poet, the, author, thus, if, for, example, a, poem, asserts, i, killed, my, enemy, in, reno, it, is, the, speaker, not, the, poet, who, is, the, killer, unless, this, confession, is, a, form, of, metaphor, which, needs, to, be, considered, in, closer, context, via, close, reading, some, scholars, believe, that, the, art, of, poetry, may, predate, literacy, and, developed, from, folk, epics, and, other, oral, genres, others, however, suggest, that, poetry, did, not, necessarily, predate, writing, the, oldest, surviving, epic, poem, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, dates, from, the, 3rd, millennium, bce, in, sumer, in, mesopotamia, present, day, iraq, and, was, written, in, cuneiform, script, on, clay, tablets, and, later, on, papyrus, the, istanbul, tablet, 2461, dating, to, c, 2000, bce, describes, an, annual, rite, in, which, the, king, symbolically, married, and, mated, with, the, goddess, inanna, to, ensure, fertility, and, prosperity, some, have, labelled, it, the, world, s, oldest, love, poem, an, example, of, egyptian, epic, poetry, is, the, story, of, sinuhe, c, 1800, bce, other, ancient, epics, includes, the, greek, iliad, and, the, odyssey, the, persian, avestan, books, the, yasna, the, roman, national, epic, virgil, s, aeneid, written, between, 29, and, 19, bce, and, the, indian, epics, the, ramayana, and, the, mahabharata, epic, poetry, appears, to, have, been, composed, in, poetic, form, as, an, aid, to, memorization, and, oral, transmission, in, ancient, societies, other, forms, of, poetry, including, such, ancient, collections, of, religious, hymns, as, the, indian, sanskrit, language, rigveda, the, avestan, gathas, the, hurrian, songs, and, the, hebrew, psalms, possibly, developed, directly, from, folk, songs, the, earliest, entries, in, the, oldest, extant, collection, of, chinese, poetry, the, classic, of, poetry, shijing, were, initially, lyrics, the, shijing, with, its, collection, of, poems, and, folk, songs, was, heavily, valued, by, the, philosopher, confucius, and, is, considered, to, be, one, of, the, official, confucian, classics, his, remarks, on, the, subject, have, become, an, invaluable, source, in, ancient, music, theory, the, efforts, of, ancient, thinkers, to, determine, what, makes, poetry, distinctive, as, a, form, and, what, distinguishes, good, poetry, from, bad, resulted, in, poetics, the, study, of, the, aesthetics, of, poetry, some, ancient, societies, such, as, china, s, through, the, shijing, developed, canons, of, poetic, works, that, had, ritual, as, well, as, aesthetic, importance, more, recently, thinkers, have, struggled, to, find, a, definition, that, could, encompass, formal, differences, as, great, as, those, between, chaucer, s, canterbury, tales, and, matsuo, bash, s, oku, no, hosomichi, as, well, as, differences, in, content, spanning, tanakh, religious, poetry, love, poetry, and, rap, until, recently, the, earliest, examples, of, stressed, poetry, had, been, thought, to, be, works, composed, by, romanos, the, melodist, fl, 6th, century, ce, however, tim, whitmarsh, writes, that, an, inscribed, greek, poem, predated, romanos, stressed, poetry, classical, thinkers, in, the, west, employed, classification, as, a, way, to, define, and, assess, the, quality, of, poetry, notably, the, existing, fragments, of, aristotle, s, poetics, describe, three, genres, of, poetry, the, epic, the, comic, and, the, tragic, and, develop, rules, to, distinguish, the, highest, quality, poetry, in, each, genre, based, on, the, perceived, underlying, purposes, of, the, genre, later, aestheticians, identified, three, major, genres, epic, poetry, lyric, poetry, and, dramatic, poetry, treating, comedy, and, tragedy, as, subgenres, of, dramatic, poetry, aristotle, s, work, was, influential, throughout, the, middle, east, during, the, islamic, golden, age, as, well, as, in, europe, during, the, renaissance, later, poets, and, aestheticians, often, distinguished, poetry, from, and, defined, it, in, opposition, to, prose, which, they, generally, understood, as, writing, with, a, proclivity, to, logical, explication, and, a, linear, narrative, structure, this, does, not, imply, that, poetry, is, illogical, or, lacks, narration, but, rather, that, poetry, is, an, attempt, to, render, the, beautiful, or, sublime, without, the, burden, of, engaging, the, logical, or, narrative, thought, process, english, romantic, poet, john, keats, termed, this, escape, from, logic, negative, capability, this, romantic, approach, views, form, as, a, key, element, of, successful, poetry, because, form, is, abstract, and, distinct, from, the, underlying, notional, logic, this, approach, remained, influential, into, the, 20th, century, during, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, there, was, also, substantially, more, interaction, among, the, various, poetic, traditions, in, part, due, to, the, spread, of, european, colonialism, and, the, attendant, rise, in, global, trade, in, addition, to, a, boom, in, translation, during, the, romantic, period, numerous, ancient, works, were, rediscovered, some, 20th, century, literary, theorists, rely, less, on, the, ostensible, opposition, of, prose, and, poetry, instead, focusing, on, the, poet, as, simply, one, who, creates, using, language, and, poetry, as, what, the, poet, creates, the, underlying, concept, of, the, poet, as, creator, is, not, uncommon, and, some, modernist, poets, essentially, do, not, distinguish, between, the, creation, of, a, poem, with, words, and, creative, acts, in, other, media, other, modernists, challenge, the, very, attempt, to, define, poetry, as, misguided, the, rejection, of, traditional, forms, and, structures, for, poetry, that, began, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, coincided, with, a, questioning, of, the, purpose, and, meaning, of, traditional, definitions, of, poetry, and, of, distinctions, between, poetry, and, prose, particularly, given, examples, of, poetic, prose, and, prosaic, poetry, numerous, modernist, poets, have, written, in, non, traditional, forms, or, in, what, traditionally, would, have, been, considered, prose, although, their, writing, was, generally, infused, with, poetic, diction, and, often, with, rhythm, and, tone, established, by, non, metrical, means, while, there, was, a, substantial, formalist, reaction, within, the, modernist, schools, to, the, breakdown, of, structure, this, reaction, focused, as, much, on, the, development, of, new, formal, structures, and, syntheses, as, on, the, revival, of, older, forms, and, structures, postmodernism, goes, beyond, modernism, s, emphasis, on, the, creative, role, of, the, poet, to, emphasize, the, role, of, the, reader, of, a, text, hermeneutics, and, to, highlight, the, complex, cultural, web, within, which, a, poem, is, read, today, throughout, the, world, poetry, often, incorporates, poetic, form, and, diction, from, other, cultures, and, from, the, past, further, confounding, attempts, at, definition, and, classification, that, once, made, sense, within, a, tradition, such, as, the, western, canon, the, early, 21st, century, poetic, tradition, appears, to, continue, to, strongly, orient, itself, to, earlier, precursor, poetic, traditions, such, as, those, initiated, by, whitman, emerson, and, wordsworth, the, literary, critic, geoffrey, hartman, 1929, 2016, used, the, phrase, the, anxiety, of, demand, to, describe, the, contemporary, response, to, older, poetic, traditions, as, being, fearful, that, the, fact, no, longer, has, a, form, building, on, a, trope, introduced, by, emerson, emerson, had, maintained, that, in, the, debate, concerning, poetic, structure, where, either, form, or, fact, could, predominate, that, one, need, simply, ask, the, fact, for, the, form, this, has, been, challenged, at, various, levels, by, other, literary, scholars, such, as, harold, bloom, 1930, 2019, who, has, stated, the, generation, of, poets, who, stand, together, now, mature, and, ready, to, write, the, major, american, verse, of, the, twenty, first, century, may, yet, be, seen, as, what, stevens, called, a, great, shadow, s, last, embellishment, the, shadow, being, emerson, s, prosody, is, the, study, of, the, meter, rhythm, and, intonation, of, a, poem, rhythm, and, meter, are, different, although, closely, related, meter, is, the, definitive, pattern, established, for, a, verse, such, as, iambic, pentameter, while, rhythm, is, the, actual, sound, that, results, from, a, line, of, poetry, prosody, also, may, be, used, more, specifically, to, refer, to, the, scanning, of, poetic, lines, to, show, meter, the, methods, for, creating, poetic, rhythm, vary, across, languages, and, between, poetic, traditions, languages, are, often, described, as, having, timing, set, primarily, by, accents, syllables, or, moras, depending, on, how, rhythm, is, established, although, a, language, can, be, influenced, by, multiple, approaches, japanese, is, a, mora, timed, language, latin, catalan, french, leonese, galician, and, spanish, are, called, syllable, timed, languages, stress, timed, languages, include, english, russian, and, generally, german, varying, intonation, also, affects, how, rhythm, is, perceived, languages, can, rely, on, either, pitch, or, tone, some, languages, with, a, pitch, accent, are, vedic, sanskrit, or, ancient, greek, tonal, languages, include, chinese, vietnamese, and, most, subsaharan, languages, metrical, rhythm, generally, involves, precise, arrangements, of, stresses, or, syllables, into, repeated, patterns, called, feet, within, a, line, in, modern, english, verse, the, pattern, of, stresses, primarily, differentiate, feet, so, rhythm, based, on, meter, in, modern, english, is, most, often, founded, on, the, pattern, of, stressed, and, unstressed, syllables, alone, or, elided, in, the, classical, languages, on, the, other, hand, while, the, metrical, units, are, similar, vowel, length, rather, than, stresses, define, the, meter, old, english, poetry, used, a, metrical, pattern, involving, varied, numbers, of, syllables, but, a, fixed, number, of, strong, stresses, in, each, line, the, chief, device, of, ancient, hebrew, biblical, poetry, including, many, of, the, psalms, was, parallelism, a, rhetorical, structure, in, which, successive, lines, reflected, each, other, in, grammatical, structure, sound, structure, notional, content, or, all, three, parallelism, lent, itself, to, antiphonal, or, call, and, response, performance, which, could, also, be, reinforced, by, intonation, thus, biblical, poetry, relies, much, less, on, metrical, feet, to, create, rhythm, but, instead, creates, rhythm, based, on, much, larger, sound, units, of, lines, phrases, and, sentences, some, classical, poetry, forms, such, as, venpa, of, the, tamil, language, had, rigid, grammars, to, the, point, that, they, could, be, expressed, as, a, context, free, grammar, which, ensured, a, rhythm, classical, chinese, poetics, based, on, the, tone, system, of, middle, chinese, recognized, two, kinds, of, tones, the, level, p, ng, tone, and, the, oblique, z, tones, a, category, consisting, of, the, rising, sh, ng, tone, the, departing, q, tone, and, the, entering, r, tone, certain, forms, of, poetry, placed, constraints, on, which, syllables, were, required, to, be, level, and, which, oblique, the, formal, patterns, of, meter, used, in, modern, english, verse, to, create, rhythm, no, longer, dominate, contemporary, english, poetry, in, the, case, of, free, verse, rhythm, is, often, organized, based, on, looser, units, of, cadence, rather, than, a, regular, meter, robinson, jeffers, marianne, moore, and, william, carlos, williams, are, three, notable, poets, who, reject, the, idea, that, regular, accentual, meter, is, critical, to, english, poetry, jeffers, experimented, with, sprung, rhythm, as, an, alternative, to, accentual, rhythm, in, the, western, poetic, tradition, meters, are, customarily, grouped, according, to, a, characteristic, metrical, foot, and, the, number, of, feet, per, line, the, number, of, metrical, feet, in, a, line, are, described, using, greek, terminology, tetrameter, for, four, feet, and, hexameter, for, six, feet, for, example, thus, iambic, pentameter, is, a, meter, comprising, five, feet, per, line, in, which, the, predominant, kind, of, foot, is, the, iamb, this, metric, system, originated, in, ancient, greek, poetry, and, was, used, by, poets, such, as, pindar, and, sappho, and, by, the, great, tragedians, of, athens, similarly, dactylic, hexameter, comprises, six, feet, per, line, of, which, the, dominant, kind, of, foot, is, the, dactyl, dactylic, hexameter, was, the, traditional, meter, of, greek, epic, poetry, the, earliest, extant, examples, of, which, are, the, works, of, homer, and, hesiod, iambic, pentameter, and, dactylic, hexameter, were, later, used, by, a, number, of, poets, including, william, shakespeare, and, henry, wadsworth, longfellow, respectively, the, most, common, metrical, feet, in, english, are, there, are, a, wide, range, of, names, for, other, types, of, feet, right, up, to, a, choriamb, a, four, syllable, metric, foot, with, a, stressed, syllable, followed, by, two, unstressed, syllables, and, closing, with, a, stressed, syllable, the, choriamb, is, derived, from, some, ancient, greek, and, latin, poetry, languages, which, use, vowel, length, or, intonation, rather, than, or, in, addition, to, syllabic, accents, in, determining, meter, such, as, ottoman, turkish, or, vedic, often, have, concepts, similar, to, the, iamb, and, dactyl, to, describe, common, combinations, of, long, and, short, sounds, each, of, these, types, of, feet, has, a, certain, feel, whether, alone, or, in, combination, with, other, feet, the, iamb, for, example, is, the, most, natural, form, of, rhythm, in, the, english, language, and, generally, produces, a, subtle, but, stable, verse, scanning, meter, can, often, show, the, basic, or, fundamental, pattern, underlying, a, verse, but, does, not, show, the, varying, degrees, of, stress, as, well, as, the, differing, pitches, and, lengths, of, syllables, there, is, debate, over, how, useful, a, multiplicity, of, different, feet, is, in, describing, meter, for, example, robert, pinsky, has, argued, that, while, dactyls, are, important, in, classical, verse, english, dactylic, verse, uses, dactyls, very, irregularly, and, can, be, better, described, based, on, patterns, of, iambs, and, anapests, feet, which, he, considers, natural, to, the, language, actual, rhythm, is, significantly, more, complex, than, the, basic, scanned, meter, described, above, and, many, scholars, have, sought, to, develop, systems, that, would, scan, such, complexity, vladimir, nabokov, noted, that, overlaid, on, top, of, the, regular, pattern, of, stressed, and, unstressed, syllables, in, a, line, of, verse, was, a, separate, pattern, of, accents, resulting, from, the, natural, pitch, of, the, spoken, words, and, suggested, that, the, term, scud, be, used, to, distinguish, an, unaccented, stress, from, an, accented, stress, different, traditions, and, genres, of, poetry, tend, to, use, different, meters, ranging, from, the, shakespearean, iambic, pentameter, and, the, homeric, dactylic, hexameter, to, the, anapestic, tetrameter, used, in, many, nursery, rhymes, however, a, number, of, variations, to, the, established, meter, are, common, both, to, provide, emphasis, or, attention, to, a, given, foot, or, line, and, to, avoid, boring, repetition, for, example, the, stress, in, a, foot, may, be, inverted, a, caesura, or, pause, may, be, added, sometimes, in, place, of, a, foot, or, stress, or, the, final, foot, in, a, line, may, be, given, a, feminine, ending, to, soften, it, or, be, replaced, by, a, spondee, to, emphasize, it, and, create, a, hard, stop, some, patterns, such, as, iambic, pentameter, tend, to, be, fairly, regular, while, other, patterns, such, as, dactylic, hexameter, tend, to, be, highly, irregular, regularity, can, vary, between, language, in, addition, different, patterns, often, develop, distinctively, in, different, languages, so, that, for, example, iambic, tetrameter, in, russian, will, generally, reflect, a, regularity, in, the, use, of, accents, to, reinforce, the, meter, which, does, not, occur, or, occurs, to, a, much, lesser, extent, in, english, some, common, metrical, patterns, with, notable, examples, of, poets, and, poems, who, use, them, include, rhyme, alliteration, assonance, and, consonance, are, ways, of, creating, repetitive, patterns, of, sound, they, may, be, used, as, an, independent, structural, element, in, a, poem, to, reinforce, rhythmic, patterns, or, as, an, ornamental, element, they, can, also, carry, a, meaning, separate, from, the, repetitive, sound, patterns, created, for, example, chaucer, used, heavy, alliteration, to, mock, old, english, verse, and, to, paint, a, character, as, archaic, rhyme, consists, of, identical, hard, rhyme, or, similar, soft, rhyme, sounds, placed, at, the, ends, of, lines, or, at, locations, within, lines, internal, rhyme, languages, vary, in, the, richness, of, their, rhyming, structures, italian, for, example, has, a, rich, rhyming, structure, permitting, maintenance, of, a, limited, set, of, rhymes, throughout, a, lengthy, poem, the, richness, results, from, word, endings, that, follow, regular, forms, english, with, its, irregular, word, endings, adopted, from, other, languages, is, less, rich, in, rhyme, the, degree, of, richness, of, a, language, s, rhyming, structures, plays, a, substantial, role, in, determining, what, poetic, forms, are, commonly, used, in, that, language, alliteration, is, the, repetition, of, letters, or, letter, sounds, at, the, beginning, of, two, or, more, words, immediately, succeeding, each, other, or, at, short, intervals, or, the, recurrence, of, the, same, letter, in, accented, parts, of, words, alliteration, and, assonance, played, a, key, role, in, structuring, early, germanic, norse, and, old, english, forms, of, poetry, the, alliterative, patterns, of, early, germanic, poetry, interweave, meter, and, alliteration, as, a, key, part, of, their, structure, so, that, the, metrical, pattern, determines, when, the, listener, expects, instances, of, alliteration, to, occur, this, can, be, compared, to, an, ornamental, use, of, alliteration, in, most, modern, european, poetry, where, alliterative, patterns, are, not, formal, or, carried, through, full, stanzas, alliteration, is, particularly, useful, in, languages, with, less, rich, rhyming, structures, assonance, where, the, use, of, similar, vowel, sounds, within, a, word, rather, than, similar, sounds, at, the, beginning, or, end, of, a, word, was, widely, used, in, skaldic, poetry, but, goes, back, to, the, homeric, epic, because, verbs, carry, much, of, the, pitch, in, the, english, language, assonance, can, loosely, evoke, the, tonal, elements, of, chinese, poetry, and, so, is, useful, in, translating, chinese, poetry, consonance, occurs, where, a, consonant, sound, is, repeated, throughout, a, sentence, without, putting, the, sound, only, at, the, front, of, a, word, consonance, provokes, a, more, subtle, effect, than, alliteration, and, so, is, less, useful, as, a, structural, element, in, many, languages, including, arabic, and, modern, european, languages, poets, use, rhyme, in, set, patterns, as, a, structural, element, for, specific, poetic, forms, such, as, ballads, sonnets, and, rhyming, couplets, however, the, use, of, structural, rhyme, is, not, universal, even, within, the, european, tradition, much, modern, poetry, avoids, traditional, rhyme, schemes, classical, greek, and, latin, poetry, did, not, use, rhyme, rhyme, entered, european, poetry, in, the, high, middle, ages, due, to, the, influence, of, the, arabic, language, in, al, andalus, arabic, language, poets, used, rhyme, extensively, not, only, with, the, development, of, literary, arabic, in, the, sixth, century, but, also, with, the, much, older, oral, poetry, as, in, their, long, rhyming, qasidas, some, rhyming, schemes, have, become, associated, with, a, specific, language, culture, or, period, while, other, rhyming, schemes, have, achieved, use, across, languages, cultures, or, time, periods, some, forms, of, poetry, carry, a, consistent, and, well, defined, rhyming, scheme, such, as, the, chant, royal, or, the, rubaiyat, while, other, poetic, forms, have, variable, rhyme, schemes, most, rhyme, schemes, are, described, using, letters, that, correspond, to, sets, of, rhymes, so, if, the, first, second, and, fourth, lines, of, a, quatrain, rhyme, with, each, other, and, the, third, line, do, not, rhyme, the, quatrain, is, said, to, have, an, aa, ba, rhyme, scheme, this, rhyme, scheme, is, the, one, used, for, example, in, the, rubaiyat, form, similarly, an, a, bb, a, quatrain, what, is, known, as, enclosed, rhyme, is, used, in, such, forms, as, the, petrarchan, sonnet, some, types, of, more, complicated, rhyming, schemes, have, developed, names, of, their, own, separate, from, the, a, bc, convention, such, as, the, ottava, rima, and, terza, rima, the, types, and, use, of, differing, rhyming, schemes, are, discussed, further, in, the, main, article, poetic, form, is, more, flexible, in, modernist, and, post, modernist, poetry, and, continues, to, be, less, structured, than, in, previous, literary, eras, many, modern, poets, eschew, recognizable, structures, or, forms, and, write, in, free, verse, free, verse, is, however, not, formless, but, composed, of, a, series, of, more, subtle, more, flexible, prosodic, elements, thus, poetry, remains, in, all, its, styles, distinguished, from, prose, by, form, some, regard, for, basic, formal, structures, of, poetry, will, be, found, in, all, varieties, of, free, verse, however, much, such, structures, may, appear, to, have, been, ignored, similarly, in, the, best, poetry, written, in, classic, styles, there, will, be, departures, from, strict, form, for, emphasis, or, effect, among, major, structural, elements, used, in, poetry, are, the, line, the, stanza, or, verse, paragraph, and, larger, combinations, of, stanzas, or, lines, such, as, cantos, also, sometimes, used, are, broader, visual, presentations, of, words, and, calligraphy, these, basic, units, of, poetic, form, are, often, combined, into, larger, structures, called, poetic, forms, or, poetic, modes, see, the, following, section, as, in, the, sonnet, poetry, is, often, separated, into, lines, on, a, page, in, a, process, known, as, lineation, these, lines, may, be, based, on, the, number, of, metrical, feet, or, may, emphasize, a, rhyming, pattern, at, the, ends, of, lines, lines, may, serve, other, functions, particularly, where, the, poem, is, not, written, in, a, formal, metrical, pattern, lines, can, separate, compare, or, contrast, thoughts, expressed, in, different, units, or, can, highlight, a, change, in, tone, see, the, article, on, line, breaks, for, information, about, the, division, between, lines, lines, of, poems, are, often, organized, into, stanzas, which, are, denominated, by, the, number, of, lines, included, thus, a, collection, of, two, lines, is, a, couplet, or, distich, three, lines, a, triplet, or, tercet, four, lines, a, quatrain, and, so, on, these, lines, may, or, may, not, relate, to, each, other, by, rhyme, or, rhythm, for, example, a, couplet, may, be, two, lines, with, identical, meters, which, rhyme, or, two, lines, held, together, by, a, common, meter, alone, other, poems, may, be, organized, into, verse, paragraphs, in, which, regular, rhymes, with, established, rhythms, are, not, used, but, the, poetic, tone, is, instead, established, by, a, collection, of, rhythms, alliterations, and, rhymes, established, in, paragraph, form, many, medieval, poems, were, written, in, verse, paragraphs, even, where, regular, rhymes, and, rhythms, were, used, in, many, forms, of, poetry, stanzas, are, interlocking, so, that, the, rhyming, scheme, or, other, structural, elements, of, one, stanza, determine, those, of, succeeding, stanzas, examples, of, such, interlocking, stanzas, include, for, example, the, ghazal, and, the, villanelle, where, a, refrain, or, in, the, case, of, the, villanelle, refrains, is, established, in, the, first, stanza, which, then, repeats, in, subsequent, stanzas, related, to, the, use, of, interlocking, stanzas, is, their, use, to, separate, thematic, parts, of, a, poem, for, example, the, strophe, antistrophe, and, epode, of, the, ode, form, are, often, separated, into, one, or, more, stanzas, in, some, cases, particularly, lengthier, formal, poetry, such, as, some, forms, of, epic, poetry, stanzas, themselves, are, constructed, according, to, strict, rules, and, then, combined, in, skaldic, poetry, the, dr, ttkv, tt, stanza, had, eight, lines, each, having, three, lifts, produced, with, alliteration, or, assonance, in, addition, to, two, or, three, alliterations, the, odd, numbered, lines, had, partial, rhyme, of, consonants, with, dissimilar, vowels, not, necessarily, at, the, beginning, of, the, word, the, even, lines, contained, internal, rhyme, in, set, syllables, not, necessarily, at, the, end, of, the, word, each, half, line, had, exactly, six, syllables, and, each, line, ended, in, a, trochee, the, arrangement, of, dr, ttkv, tts, followed, far, less, rigid, rules, than, the, construction, of, the, individual, dr, ttkv, tts, even, before, the, advent, of, printing, the, visual, appearance, of, poetry, often, added, meaning, or, depth, acrostic, poems, conveyed, meanings, in, the, initial, letters, of, lines, or, in, letters, at, other, specific, places, in, a, poem, in, arabic, hebrew, and, chinese, poetry, the, visual, presentation, of, finely, calligraphed, poems, has, played, an, important, part, in, the, overall, effect, of, many, poems, with, the, advent, of, printing, poets, gained, greater, control, over, the, mass, produced, visual, presentations, of, their, work, visual, elements, have, become, an, important, part, of, the, poet, s, toolbox, and, many, poets, have, sought, to, use, visual, presentation, for, a, wide, range, of, purposes, some, modernist, poets, have, made, the, placement, of, individual, lines, or, groups, of, lines, on, the, page, an, integral, part, of, the, poem, s, composition, at, times, this, complements, the, poem, s, rhythm, through, visual, caesuras, of, various, lengths, or, creates, juxtapositions, so, as, to, accentuate, meaning, ambiguity, or, irony, or, simply, to, create, an, aesthetically, pleasing, form, in, its, most, extreme, form, this, can, lead, to, concrete, poetry, or, asemic, writing, poetic, diction, treats, the, manner, in, which, language, is, used, and, refers, not, only, to, the, sound, but, also, to, the, underlying, meaning, and, its, interaction, with, sound, and, form, many, languages, and, poetic, forms, have, very, specific, poetic, dictions, to, the, point, where, distinct, grammars, and, dialects, are, used, specifically, for, poetry, registers, in, poetry, can, range, from, strict, employment, of, ordinary, speech, patterns, as, favoured, in, much, late, 20th, century, prosody, through, to, highly, ornate, uses, of, language, as, in, medieval, and, renaissance, poetry, poetic, diction, can, include, rhetorical, devices, such, as, simile, and, metaphor, as, well, as, tones, of, voice, such, as, irony, aristotle, wrote, in, the, poetics, that, the, greatest, thing, by, far, is, to, be, a, master, of, metaphor, since, the, rise, of, modernism, some, poets, have, opted, for, a, poetic, diction, that, de, emphasizes, rhetorical, devices, attempting, instead, the, direct, presentation, of, things, and, experiences, and, the, exploration, of, tone, on, the, other, hand, surrealists, have, pushed, rhetorical, devices, to, their, limits, making, frequent, use, of, catachresis, allegorical, stories, are, central, to, the, poetic, diction, of, many, cultures, and, were, prominent, in, the, west, during, classical, times, the, late, middle, ages, and, the, renaissance, aesop, s, fables, repeatedly, rendered, in, both, verse, and, prose, since, first, being, recorded, about, 500, bce, are, perhaps, the, richest, single, source, of, allegorical, poetry, through, the, ages, other, notables, examples, include, the, roman, de, la, rose, a, 13th, century, french, poem, william, langland, s, piers, ploughman, in, the, 14th, century, and, jean, de, la, fontaine, s, fables, influenced, by, aesop, s, in, the, 17th, century, rather, than, being, fully, allegorical, however, a, poem, may, contain, symbols, or, allusions, that, deepen, the, meaning, or, effect, of, its, words, without, constructing, a, full, allegory, another, element, of, poetic, diction, can, be, the, use, of, vivid, imagery, for, effect, the, juxtaposition, of, unexpected, or, impossible, images, is, for, example, a, particularly, strong, element, in, surrealist, poetry, and, haiku, vivid, images, are, often, endowed, with, symbolism, or, metaphor, many, poetic, dictions, use, repetitive, phrases, for, effect, either, a, short, phrase, such, as, homer, s, rosy, fingered, dawn, or, the, wine, dark, sea, or, a, longer, refrain, such, repetition, can, add, a, somber, tone, to, a, poem, or, can, be, laced, with, irony, as, the, context, of, the, words, changes, specific, poetic, forms, have, been, developed, by, many, cultures, in, more, developed, closed, or, received, poetic, forms, the, rhyming, scheme, meter, and, other, elements, of, a, poem, are, based, on, sets, of, rules, ranging, from, the, relatively, loose, rules, that, govern, the, construction, of, an, elegy, to, the, highly, formalized, structure, of, the, ghazal, or, villanelle, described, below, are, some, common, forms, of, poetry, widely, used, across, a, number, of, languages, additional, forms, of, poetry, may, be, found, in, the, discussions, of, the, poetry, of, particular, cultures, or, periods, and, in, the, glossary, among, the, most, common, forms, of, poetry, popular, from, the, late, middle, ages, on, is, the, sonnet, which, by, the, 13th, century, had, become, standardized, as, fourteen, lines, following, a, set, rhyme, scheme, and, logical, structure, by, the, 14th, century, and, the, italian, renaissance, the, form, had, further, crystallized, under, the, pen, of, petrarch, whose, sonnets, were, translated, in, the, 16th, century, by, sir, thomas, wyatt, who, is, credited, with, introducing, the, sonnet, form, into, english, literature, a, traditional, italian, or, petrarchan, sonnet, follows, the, rhyme, scheme, abba, abba, cdecde, though, some, variation, perhaps, the, most, common, being, cdcdcd, especially, within, the, final, six, lines, or, sestet, is, common, the, english, or, shakespearean, sonnet, follows, the, rhyme, scheme, abab, cdcd, efef, gg, introducing, a, third, quatrain, grouping, of, four, lines, a, final, couplet, and, a, greater, amount, of, variety, in, rhyme, than, is, usually, found, in, its, italian, predecessors, by, convention, sonnets, in, english, typically, use, iambic, pentameter, while, in, the, romance, languages, the, hendecasyllable, and, alexandrine, are, the, most, widely, used, meters, sonnets, of, all, types, often, make, use, of, a, volta, or, turn, a, point, in, the, poem, at, which, an, idea, is, turned, on, its, head, a, question, is, answered, or, introduced, or, the, subject, matter, is, further, complicated, this, volta, can, often, take, the, form, of, a, but, statement, contradicting, or, complicating, the, content, of, the, earlier, lines, in, the, petrarchan, sonnet, the, turn, tends, to, fall, around, the, division, between, the, first, two, quatrains, and, the, sestet, while, english, sonnets, usually, place, it, at, or, near, the, beginning, of, the, closing, couplet, sonnets, are, particularly, associated, with, high, poetic, diction, vivid, imagery, and, romantic, love, largely, due, to, the, influence, of, petrarch, as, well, as, of, early, english, practitioners, such, as, edmund, spenser, who, gave, his, name, to, the, spenserian, sonnet, michael, drayton, and, shakespeare, whose, sonnets, are, among, the, most, famous, in, english, poetry, with, twenty, being, included, in, the, oxford, book, of, english, verse, however, the, twists, and, turns, associated, with, the, volta, allow, for, a, logical, flexibility, applicable, to, many, subjects, poets, from, the, earliest, centuries, of, the, sonnet, to, the, present, have, used, the, form, to, address, topics, related, to, politics, john, milton, percy, bysshe, shelley, claude, mckay, theology, john, donne, gerard, manley, hopkins, war, wilfred, owen, e, e, cummings, and, gender, and, sexuality, carol, ann, duffy, further, postmodern, authors, such, as, ted, berrigan, and, john, berryman, have, challenged, the, traditional, definitions, of, the, sonnet, form, rendering, entire, sequences, of, sonnets, that, often, lack, rhyme, a, clear, logical, progression, or, even, a, consistent, count, of, fourteen, lines, shi, simplified, chinese, traditional, chinese, pinyin, sh, wade, giles, shih, is, the, main, type, of, classical, chinese, poetry, within, this, form, of, poetry, the, most, important, variations, are, folk, song, styled, verse, yuefu, old, style, verse, gushi, modern, style, verse, jintishi,

parallelism, as, a, key, poetic, device, the, old, style, verse, gushi, is, less, formally, strict, than, the, jintishi, or, regulated, verse, which, despite, the, name, new, style, verse, actually, had, its, theoretical, basis, laid, as, far, back, as, shen, yue, 441, 513, ce, although, not, considered, to, have, reached, its, full, development, until, the, time, of, chen, zi, ang, 661, 702, ce,

is, concluded, by, the, two, refrains, the, remaining, lines, of, the, poem, have, an, ab, alternating, rhyme, the, villanelle, has, been, used, regularly, in, the, english, language, since, the,
