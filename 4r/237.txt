the, history, of, the, peloponnesian, war, is, a, historical, account, of, the, peloponnesian, war, 431, 404, bc, which, was, fought, between, the, peloponnesian, league, led, by, sparta, and, the, delian, league, led, by, athens, it, was, written, by, thucydides, an, athenian, historian, who, also, served, as, an, athenian, general, during, the, war, his, account, of, the, conflict, is, widely, considered, to, be, a, classic, and, regarded, as, one, of, the, earliest, scholarly, works, of, history, the, history, is, divided, into, eight, books, analyses, of, the, history, generally, occur, in, one, of, two, camps, on, the, one, hand, some, scholars, such, as, j, b, bury, view, the, work, as, an, objective, and, scientific, piece, of, history, the, judgment, of, bury, reflects, this, traditional, interpretation, of, the, history, as, severe, in, its, detachment, written, from, a, purely, intellectual, point, of, view, unencumbered, with, platitudes, and, moral, judgments, cold, and, critical, on, the, other, hand, in, keeping, with, more, recent, interpretations, that, are, associated, with, reader, response, criticism, the, history, can, be, read, as, a, piece, of, literature, rather, than, an, objective, record, of, the, historical, events, this, view, is, embodied, in, the, words, of, w, r, connor, who, describes, thucydides, as, an, artist, who, responds, to, selects, and, skillfully, arranges, his, material, and, develops, its, symbolic, and, emotional, potential, thucydides, is, considered, to, be, one, of, the, key, figures, in, the, development, of, western, history, thus, making, his, methodology, the, subject, of, much, analysis, in, the, area, of, historiography, thucydides, is, one, of, the, first, western, historians, to, employ, a, strict, standard, of, chronology, recording, events, by, year, with, each, year, consisting, of, the, summer, campaign, season, and, a, less, active, winter, season, this, method, contrasts, sharply, with, herodotus, thucydides, also, makes, extensive, use, of, speeches, in, order, to, elaborate, on, the, event, in, question, while, the, inclusion, of, long, first, person, speeches, is, somewhat, alien, to, modern, historical, method, in, the, context, of, ancient, greek, oral, culture, speeches, are, expected, these, include, addresses, given, to, troops, by, their, generals, before, battles, and, numerous, political, speeches, both, by, athenian, and, spartan, leaders, as, well, as, debates, between, various, parties, of, the, speeches, the, most, famous, is, the, funeral, oration, of, pericles, which, is, found, in, book, two, being, an, athenian, general, in, the, war, thucydides, heard, some, of, these, speeches, himself, for, the, other, speeches, he, relied, on, eyewitness, accounts, these, speeches, are, suspect, in, the, eyes, of, classicists, however, inasmuch, as, it, is, not, clear, to, what, degree, thucydides, altered, these, speeches, in, order, to, elucidate, better, the, crux, of, the, argument, presented, some, of, the, speeches, are, probably, fabricated, according, to, his, expectations, of, as, he, puts, it, what, was, called, for, in, each, situation, 1, 22, 1, despite, being, an, athenian, and, a, participant, in, the, conflict, thucydides, is, often, regarded, as, having, written, a, generally, unbiased, account, of, the, conflict, with, respect, to, the, sides, involved, in, it, in, the, introduction, to, the, piece, he, states, my, work, is, not, a, piece, of, writing, designed, to, meet, the, taste, of, an, immediate, public, but, was, done, to, last, for, ever, 1, 22, 4, there, are, scholars, however, who, doubt, this, ernst, badian, for, example, has, argued, that, thucydides, has, a, strong, pro, athenian, bias, in, keeping, with, this, sort, of, doubt, other, scholars, claim, that, thucydides, had, an, ulterior, motive, in, his, histories, specifically, to, create, an, epic, comparable, to, those, of, the, past, such, as, the, works, of, homer, and, that, this, led, him, to, create, a, nonobjective, dualism, favoring, the, athenians, the, work, does, display, a, clear, bias, against, certain, people, involved, in, the, conflict, such, as, cleon, the, gods, play, no, active, role, in, thucydides, work, this, is, very, different, from, herodotus, who, frequently, mentions, the, role, of, the, gods, as, well, as, a, nearly, ubiquitous, divine, presence, in, the, centuries, earlier, poems, of, homer, instead, thucydides, regards, history, as, being, caused, by, the, choices, and, actions, of, human, beings, despite, the, absence, of, actions, of, the, gods, religion, and, piety, play, critical, roles, in, the, actions, of, the, spartans, and, to, a, lesser, degree, the, athenians, thus, natural, occurrences, such, as, earthquakes, and, eclipses, were, viewed, as, religiously, significant, 1, 23, 3, 7, 50, 4, despite, the, absence, of, the, gods, from, thucydides, work, he, still, draws, heavily, from, the, greek, mythos, especially, from, homer, whose, works, are, prominent, in, greek, mythology, thucydides, references, homer, frequently, as, a, source, of, information, but, always, adds, a, distancing, clause, such, as, homer, shows, this, if, that, is, sufficient, evidence, and, assuming, we, should, trust, homer, s, poetry, in, this, case, too, however, despite, thucydides, skepticism, in, secondhand, information, such, as, homer, s, he, does, use, the, poet, s, epics, to, infer, facts, about, the, trojan, war, for, instance, while, thucydides, considered, the, number, of, over, 1, 000, greek, ships, sent, to, troy, to, be, a, poetic, exaggeration, he, uses, homer, s, catalogue, of, ships, to, determine, the, approximate, number, of, greek, soldiers, who, were, present, later, thucydides, claims, that, since, homer, never, makes, reference, to, a, united, greek, state, the, pre, hellenic, nations, must, have, been, so, disjointed, that, they, could, not, organize, properly, to, launch, an, effective, campaign, in, fact, thucydides, claims, that, troy, could, have, been, conquered, in, half, the, time, had, the, greek, leaders, allocated, resources, properly, and, not, sent, a, large, portion, of, the, army, on, raids, for, supplies, thucydides, makes, sure, to, inform, his, reader, that, he, unlike, homer, is, not, a, poet, prone, to, exaggeration, but, instead, a, historian, whose, stories, may, not, give, momentary, pleasure, but, whose, intended, meaning, will, be, challenged, by, the, truth, of, the, facts, by, distancing, himself, from, the, storytelling, practices, of, homer, thucydides, makes, it, clear, that, while, he, does, consider, mythology, and, epics, to, be, evidence, these, works, cannot, be, given, much, credibility, and, that, it, takes, an, impartial, and, empirically, minded, historian, such, as, himself, to, accurately, portray, the, events, of, the, past, the, first, book, of, the, history, after, a, brief, review, of, early, greek, history, and, some, programmatic, historiographical, commentary, seeks, to, explain, why, the, peloponnesian, war, broke, out, when, it, did, and, what, its, causes, were, except, for, a, few, short, excursuses, notably, 6, 54, 58, on, the, tyrant, slayers, the, remainder, of, the, history, books, 2, through, 8, rigidly, maintains, its, focus, on, the, peloponnesian, war, to, the, exclusion, of, other, topics, while, the, history, concentrates, on, the, military, aspects, of, the, peloponnesian, war, it, uses, these, events, as, a, medium, to, suggest, several, other, themes, closely, related, to, the, war, it, specifically, discusses, in, several, passages, the, socially, and, culturally, degenerative, effects, of, war, on, humanity, itself, the, history, is, especially, concerned, with, the, lawlessness, and, atrocities, committed, by, greek, citizens, to, each, other, in, the, name, of, one, side, or, another, in, the, war, some, events, depicted, in, the, history, such, as, the, melian, dialogue, describe, early, instances, of, realpolitik, or, power, politics, noteworthy, there, is, a, possibility, that, translation, mistakes, influenced, the, deductions, of, realists, with, regards, to, the, work, of, thucydides, the, history, is, preoccupied, with, the, interplay, of, justice, and, power, in, political, and, military, decision, making, thucydides, presentation, is, decidedly, ambivalent, on, this, theme, while, the, history, seems, to, suggest, that, considerations, of, justice, are, artificial, and, necessarily, capitulate, to, power, it, sometimes, also, shows, a, significant, degree, of, empathy, with, those, who, suffer, from, the, exigencies, of, the, war, for, the, most, part, the, history, does, not, discuss, topics, such, as, the, art, and, architecture, of, greece, the, history, emphasizes, the, development, of, military, technologies, in, several, passages, 1, 14, 3, 2, 75, 76, 7, 36, 2, 3, thucydides, describes, in, detail, various, innovations, in, the, conduct, of, siegeworks, or, naval, warfare, the, history, places, great, importance, upon, naval, supremacy, arguing, that, a, modern, empire, is, impossible, without, a, strong, navy, he, states, that, this, is, the, result, of, the, development, of, piracy, and, coastal, settlements, in, earlier, greece, important, in, this, regard, was, the, development, at, the, beginning, of, the, classical, period, c, 500, bc, of, the, trireme, the, supreme, naval, ship, for, the, next, several, hundred, years, in, his, emphasis, on, sea, power, thucydides, is, echoed, by, the, modern, naval, theorist, alfred, thayer, mahan, whose, influential, work, the, influence, of, sea, power, upon, history, helped, set, in, motion, the, naval, arms, race, prior, to, world, war, i, the, history, explains, that, the, primary, cause, of, the, peloponnesian, war, was, the, growth, in, power, of, athens, and, the, alarm, which, this, inspired, in, sparta, 1, 23, 6, thucydides, traces, the, development, of, athenian, power, through, the, growth, of, the, athenian, empire, in, the, years, 479, bc, to, 432, bc, in, book, one, of, the, history, 1, 89, 118, the, legitimacy, of, the, empire, is, explored, in, several, passages, notably, in, the, speech, at, 1, 73, 78, where, an, anonymous, athenian, legation, defends, the, empire, on, the, grounds, that, it, was, freely, given, to, the, athenians, and, not, taken, by, force, the, subsequent, expansion, of, the, empire, is, defended, by, these, athenians, the, nature, of, the, case, first, compelled, us, to, advance, our, empire, to, its, present, height, fear, being, our, principal, motive, though, honor, and, interest, came, afterward, 1, 75, 3, the, athenians, also, argue, that, we, have, done, nothing, extraordinary, nothing, contrary, to, human, nature, in, accepting, an, empire, when, it, was, offered, to, us, and, then, in, refusing, to, give, it, up, 1, 76, they, claim, that, anyone, in, their, position, would, act, in, the, same, fashion, the, spartans, represent, a, more, traditional, circumspect, and, less, expansive, power, indeed, the, athenians, are, nearly, destroyed, by, their, greatest, act, of, imperial, overreach, the, sicilian, expedition, described, in, books, six, and, seven, of, the, history, thucydides, correlates, in, his, description, of, the, 426, bc, malian, gulf, tsunami, for, the, first, time, in, the, recorded, history, of, natural, science, quakes, and, waves, in, terms, of, cause, and, effect, thucydides, history, is, extraordinarily, dense, and, complex, his, particular, ancient, greek, prose, is, also, very, challenging, grammatically, syntactically, and, semantically, this, has, resulted, in, much, scholarly, disagreement, on, a, cluster, of, issues, of, interpretation, it, is, commonly, thought, that, thucydides, died, while, still, working, on, the, history, since, it, ends, in, mid, sentence, and, only, goes, up, to, 411, bc, leaving, six, years, of, war, uncovered, furthermore, there, is, a, great, deal, of, uncertainty, whether, he, intended, to, revise, the, sections, he, had, already, written, since, there, appear, to, be, some, contradictions, between, certain, passages, in, the, history, it, has, been, proposed, that, the, conflicting, passages, were, written, at, different, times, and, that, thucydides, opinion, on, the, conflicting, matter, had, changed, those, who, argue, that, the, history, can, be, divided, into, various, levels, of, composition, are, usually, called, analysts, and, those, who, argue, that, the, passages, must, be, made, to, reconcile, with, one, another, are, called, unitarians, this, conflict, is, called, the, strata, of, composition, debate, the, lack, of, progress, in, this, debate, over, the, course, of, the, twentieth, century, has, caused, many, thucydidean, scholars, to, declare, the, debate, insoluble, and, to, side, step, the, issue, in, their, work, the, history, is, notoriously, reticent, about, its, sources, thucydides, almost, never, names, his, informants, and, alludes, to, competing, versions, of, events, only, a, handful, of, times, this, is, in, marked, contrast, to, herodotus, who, frequently, mentions, multiple, versions, of, his, stories, and, allows, the, reader, to, decide, which, is, true, instead, thucydides, strives, to, create, the, impression, of, a, seamless, and, irrefutable, narrative, nevertheless, scholars, have, sought, to, detect, the, sources, behind, the, various, sections, of, the, history, for, example, the, narrative, after, thucydides, exile, 4, 108, ff, seems, to, focus, on, peloponnesian, events, more, than, the, first, four, books, leading, to, the, conclusion, that, he, had, greater, access, to, peloponnesian, sources, at, that, time, frequently, thucydides, appears, to, assert, knowledge, of, the, thoughts, of, individuals, at, key, moments, in, the, narrative, scholars, have, asserted, that, these, moments, are, evidence, that, he, interviewed, these, individuals, after, the, fact, however, the, evidence, of, the, sicilian, expedition, argues, against, this, since, thucydides, discusses, the, thoughts, of, the, generals, who, died, there, and, whom, he, would, have, had, no, chance, to, interview, instead, it, seems, likely, that, as, with, the, speeches, thucydides, is, looser, than, previously, thought, in, inferring, the, thoughts, feelings, and, motives, of, principal, characters, in, his, history, from, their, actions, as, well, as, his, own, sense, of, what, would, be, appropriate, or, likely, in, such, a, situation, the, historian, j, b, bury, writes, that, the, work, of, thucydides, marks, the, longest, and, most, decisive, step, that, has, ever, been, taken, by, a, single, man, towards, making, history, what, it, is, today, historian, h, d, kitto, feels, that, thucydides, wrote, about, the, peloponnesian, war, not, because, it, was, the, most, significant, war, in, antiquity, but, because, it, caused, the, most, suffering, indeed, several, passages, of, thucydides, book, are, written, with, an, intensity, of, feeling, hardly, exceeded, by, sappho, herself, in, his, open, society, and, its, enemies, karl, r, popper, writes, that, thucydides, was, the, greatest, historian, perhaps, who, ever, lived, thucydides, work, however, popper, goes, on, to, say, represents, an, interpretation, a, point, of, view, and, in, this, we, need, not, agree, with, him, in, the, war, between, athenian, democracy, and, the, arrested, oligarchic, tribalism, of, sparta, we, must, never, forget, thucydides, involuntary, bias, and, that, his, heart, was, not, with, athens, his, native, city, although, he, apparently, did, not, belong, to, the, extreme, wing, of, the, athenian, oligarchic, clubs, who, conspired, throughout, the, war, with, the, enemy, he, was, certainly, a, member, of, the, oligarchic, party, and, a, friend, neither, of, the, athenian, people, the, demos, who, had, exiled, him, nor, of, its, imperialist, policy, thucydides, history, has, been, enormously, influential, in, both, ancient, and, modern, historiography, it, was, embraced, by, many, of, the, author, s, contemporaries, and, immediate, successors, with, enthusiasm, indeed, many, authors, sought, to, complete, the, unfinished, history, for, example, xenophon, wrote, his, hellenica, as, a, continuation, of, thucydides, work, beginning, at, the, exact, moment, that, thucydides, history, leaves, off, in, later, antiquity, thucydides, reputation, suffered, somewhat, with, critics, such, as, dionysius, of, halicarnassus, rejecting, the, history, as, turgid, and, excessively, austere, lucian, also, parodies, it, among, others, in, his, satire, the, true, histories, woodrow, wilson, read, the, history, on, his, voyage, across, the, atlantic, to, the, versailles, peace, conference, in, the, 17th, century, english, philosopher, thomas, hobbes, who, himself, translated, the, work, wrote, about, thucydides, as, follows, it, hath, been, noted, by, divers, that, homer, in, poesy, aristotle, in, philosophy, demosthenes, in, eloquence, and, others, of, the, ancients, in, other, knowledge, do, still, maintain, their, primacy, none, of, them, exceeded, some, not, approached, by, any, in, these, later, ages, and, in, the, number, of, these, is, justly, ranked, also, our, thucydides, a, workman, no, less, perfect, in, his, work, than, any, of, the, former, and, in, whom, i, believe, with, many, others, the, faculty, of, writing, history, is, at, the, highest, the, most, important, manuscripts, include, codex, parisinus, suppl, gr, 255, codex, vaticanus, 126, codex, laurentianus, lxix, 2, codex, palatinus, 252, codex, monacensis, 430, codex, monacensis, 228, and, codex, britannicus, ii, 727, grenfell, and, hunt, discovered, about, 20, papyrus, fragments, copied,
