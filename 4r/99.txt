generally, considered, taboo, particularly, subjects, that, are, normally, considered, serious, or, painful, to, discuss, writers, and, comedians, often, use, it, as, a, tool, for, exploring, vulgar, issues, by, provoking, discomfort, serious, thought, and, amusement, for, their, audience, thus, in, fiction, for, example, the, term, black, comedy, can, also, refer, to, a, genre, in, which, dark, humor, is, a, core, component, cartoonist, charles, addams, was, famous, for, such, humor, e, g, depicting, a, boy, decorating, his, bedroom, with, stolen, warning, signs, including, no, diving, pool,

straightforward, obscenity, whereas, the, term, black, comedy, is, a, relatively, broad, term, covering, humour, relating, to, many, serious, subjects, gallows, humor, tends, to, be, used, more, specifically, in, relation, to, death, or, situations, that, are, reminiscent, of, dying, black, humour, can, occasionally, be, related, to, the, grotesque, genre, literary, critics, have, associated, black, comedy, and, black, humour, with, authors, as, early, as, the, ancient, greeks, with, aristophanes, the, term, black, humour, from, the, french, humour, noir, was, coined, by, the, surrealist, theorist, andr, breton, in, 1935, while, interpreting, the, writings, of, jonathan, swift, breton, s, preference, was, to, identify, some, of, swift, s, writings, as, a, subgenre, of, comedy, and, satire, in, which, laughter, arises, from, cynicism, and, skepticism, often, relying, on, topics, such, as, death, breton, coined, the, term, for, his, 1940, book, anthology, of, black, humor, anthologie, de, l, humour, noir, in, which, he, credited, jonathan, swift, as, the, originator, of, black, humor, and, gallows, humor, particularly, in, his, pieces, directions, to, servants, 1731, a, modest, proposal, 1729, meditation, upon, a, broomstick, 1710, and, in, a, few, aphorisms, in, his, book, breton, also, included, excerpts, from, 45, other, writers, including, both, examples, in, which, the, wit, arises, from, a, victim, with, which, the, audience, empathizes, as, is, more, typical, in, the, tradition, of, gallows, humor, and, examples, in, which, the, comedy, is, used, to, mock, the, victim, in, the, last, cases, the, victim, s, suffering, is, trivialized, which, leads, to, sympathizing, with, the, victimizer, as, analogously, found, in, the, social, commentary, and, social, criticism, of, the, writings, of, for, instance, sade, among, the, first, american, writers, who, employed, black, comedy, in, their, works, were, nathanael, west, and, vladimir, nabokov, the, concept, of, black, humor, first, came, to, nationwide, attention, after, the, publication, of, a, 1965, mass, market, paperback, titled, black, humor, edited, by, bruce, jay, friedman, the, paperback, was, one, of, the, first, american, anthologies, devoted, to, the, concept, of, black, humor, as, a, literary, genre, with, the, paperback, friedman, labeled, as, black, humorists, a, variety, of, authors, such, as, j, p, donleavy, edward, albee, joseph, heller, thomas, pynchon, john, barth, vladimir, nabokov, bruce, jay, friedman, himself, and, louis, ferdinand, c, line, among,

writers, cited, above, is, that, they, have, written, novels, poems, stories, plays, and, songs, in, which, profound, or, horrific, events, were, portrayed, in, a, comic, manner, comedians, like, lenny, bruce, who, since, the, late, 1950s, have, been, labeled, as, using, sick, comedy, by, mainstream, journalists, have, also, been, labeled, with, black, comedy, sigmund, freud, in, his, 1927,

distressed, by, the, provocations, of, reality, to, let, itself, be, compelled, to, suffer, it, insists, that, it, cannot, be, affected, by, the, traumas, of, the, external, world, it, shows, in, fact, that, such, traumas, are, no, more, than, occasions, for, it, to, gain, pleasure, some, other, sociologists, elaborated, this, concept, further, at, the, same, time, paul, lewis, warns, that, this, relieving, aspect, of, gallows, jokes, depends, on, the, context, of, the, joke, whether, the, joke, is, being, told, by, the, threatened, person, themselves, or, by, someone, else, black, comedy, has, the, social, effect, of, strengthening, the, morale, of, the, oppressed, and, undermines, the, morale, of, the, oppressors, according, to, wylie, sypher, to, be, able, to, laugh, at,

acknowledged, coping, mechanism, it, has, been, encouraged, within, these, professions, to, make, note, of, the, context, in, which, these, jokes, are, told, as, outsiders, may, not, react, the, way, that, those, with, mutual, knowledge, do, a, 2017, study, published, in, the, journal, cognitive, processing, concludes, that, people, who, appreciate, dark, humor, may, have, higher, iqs, show,
