has, been, widely, translated, with, english, versions, titled, candide, or, all, for, the, best, 1759, candide, or, the, optimist, 1762, and, candide, optimism, 1947, it, begins, with, a, young, man, candide, who, is, living, a, sheltered, life, in, an, edenic, paradise, and, being, indoctrinated, with, leibnizian, optimism, by, his, mentor, professor, pangloss, the, work, describes, the, abrupt, cessation, of, this, lifestyle, followed, by, candide, s, slow, and, painful, disillusionment, as, he, witnesses, and, experiences, great, hardships, in, the, world, voltaire, concludes, candide, with, if, not, rejecting, leibnizian, optimism, outright, advocating, a, deeply, practical, precept, we, must, cultivate, our, garden, in, lieu, of, the, leibnizian, mantra, of, pangloss, all, is, for, the, best, in, the, best, of, all, possible, worlds, candide, is, characterized, by, its, tone, as, well, as, by, its, erratic, fantastical, and, fast, moving, plot, a, picaresque, novel, with, a, story, similar, to, that, of, a, more, serious, coming, of, age, narrative, bildungsroman, it, parodies, many, adventure, and, romance, clich, s, the, struggles, of, which, are, caricatured, in, a, tone, that, is, bitter, and, matter, of, fact, still, the, events, discussed, are, often, based, on, historical, happenings, such, as, the, seven, years, war, and, the, 1755, lisbon, earthquake, as, philosophers, of, voltaire, s, day, contended, with, the, problem, of, evil, so, does, candide, in, this, short, theological, novel, albeit, more, directly, and, humorously, voltaire, ridicules, religion, theologians, governments, armies, philosophies, and, philosophers, through, candide, he, assaults, leibniz, and, his, optimism, candide, has, enjoyed, both, great, success, and, great, scandal, immediately, after, its, secretive, publication, the, book, was, widely, banned, because, it, contained, religious, blasphemy, political, sedition, and, intellectual, hostility, hidden, under, a, thin, veil, of, naivety, however, with, its, sharp, wit, and, insightful, portrayal, of, the, human, condition, the, novel, has, since, inspired, many, later, authors, and, artists, to, mimic, and, adapt, it, today, candide, is, considered, voltaire, s, magnum, opus, and, is, often, listed, as, part, of, the, western, canon, it, is, among, the, most, frequently, taught, works, of, french, literature, the, british, poet, and, literary, critic, martin, seymour, smith, listed, candide, as, one, of, the, 100, most, influential, books, ever, written, a, number, of, historical, events, inspired, voltaire, to, write, candide, most, notably, the, publication, of, leibniz, s, monadology, a, short, metaphysical, treatise, the, seven, years, war, and, the, 1755, lisbon, earthquake, both, of, the, latter, catastrophes, are, frequently, referred, to, in, candide, and, are, cited, by, scholars, as, reasons, for, its, composition, the, 1755, lisbon, earthquake, tsunami, and, resulting, fires, of, all, saints, day, had, a, strong, influence, on, theologians, of, the, day, and, on, voltaire, who, was, himself, disillusioned, by, them, the, earthquake, had, an, especially, large, effect, on, the, contemporary, doctrine, of, optimism, a, philosophical, system, founded, on, the, theodicy, of, gottfried, wilhelm, leibniz, which, insisted, on, god, s, benevolence, in, spite, of, such, events, this, concept, is, often, put, in, the, form, all, is, for, the, best, in, the, best, of, all, possible, worlds, french, tout, est, pour, le, mieux, dans, le, meilleur, des, mondes, possibles, philosophers, had, trouble, fitting, the, horrors, of, this, earthquake, into, their, optimistic, world, view, voltaire, actively, rejected, leibnizian, optimism, after, the, natural, disaster, convinced, that, if, this, were, the, best, possible, world, it, should, surely, be, better, than, it, is, in, both, candide, and, po, me, sur, le, d, sastre, de, lisbonne, poem, on, the, lisbon, disaster, voltaire, attacks, this, optimist, belief, he, makes, use, of, the, lisbon, earthquake, in, both, candide, and, his, po, me, to, argue, this, point, sarcastically, describing, the, catastrophe, as, one, of, the, most, horrible, disasters, in, the, best, of, all, possible, worlds, immediately, after, the, earthquake, unreliable, rumours, circulated, around, europe, sometimes, overestimating, the, severity, of, the, event, ira, wade, a, noted, expert, on, voltaire, and, candide, has, analyzed, which, sources, voltaire, might, have, referenced, in, learning, of, the, event, wade, speculates, that, voltaire, s, primary, source, for, information, on, the, lisbon, earthquake, was, the, 1755, work, relation, historique, du, tremblement, de, terre, survenu, lisbonne, by, ange, goudar, apart, from, such, events, contemporaneous, stereotypes, of, the, german, personality, may, have, been, a, source, of, inspiration, for, the, text, as, they, were, for, simplicius, simplicissimus, a, 1669, satirical, picaresque, novel, written, by, hans, jakob, christoffel, von, grimmelshausen, and, inspired, by, the, thirty, years, war, the, protagonist, of, this, novel, who, was, supposed, to, embody, stereotypically, german, characteristics, is, quite, similar, to, the, protagonist, of, candide, these, stereotypes, according, to, voltaire, biographer, alfred, owen, aldridge, include, extreme, credulousness, or, sentimental, simplicity, two, of, candide, s, and, simplicius, s, defining, qualities, aldridge, writes, since, voltaire, admitted, familiarity, with, fifteenth, century, german, authors, who, used, a, bold, and, buffoonish, style, it, is, quite, possible, that, he, knew, simplicissimus, as, well, a, satirical, and, parodic, precursor, of, candide, jonathan, swift, s, gulliver, s, travels, 1726, is, one, of, candide, s, closest, literary, relatives, this, satire, tells, the, story, of, a, gullible, ingenue, gulliver, who, like, candide, travels, to, several, remote, nations, and, is, hardened, by, the, many, misfortunes, which, befall, him, as, evidenced, by, similarities, between, the, two, books, voltaire, probably, drew, upon, gulliver, s, travels, for, inspiration, while, writing, candide, other, probable, sources, of, inspiration, for, candide, are, t, l, maque, 1699, by, fran, ois, f, nelon, and, cosmopolite, 1753, by, louis, charles, fougeret, de, monbron, candide, s, parody, of, the, bildungsroman, is, probably, based, on, t, l, maque, which, includes, the, prototypical, parody, of, the, tutor, on, whom, pangloss, may, have, been, partly, based, likewise, monbron, s, protagonist, undergoes, a, disillusioning, series, of, travels, similar, to, those, of, candide, born, fran, ois, marie, arouet, voltaire, 1694, 1778, by, the, time, of, the, lisbon, earthquake, was, already, a, well, established, author, known, for, his, satirical, wit, he, had, been, made, a, member, of, the, acad, mie, fran, aise, in, 1746, he, was, a, deist, a, strong, proponent, of, religious, freedom, and, a, critic, of, tyrannical, governments, candide, became, part, of, his, large, diverse, body, of, philosophical, political, and, artistic, works, expressing, these, views, more, specifically, it, was, a, model, for, the, eighteenth, and, early, nineteenth, century, novels, called, the, contes, philosophiques, this, genre, of, which, voltaire, was, one, of, the, founders, included, previous, works, of, his, such, as, zadig, and, micromegas, it, is, unknown, exactly, when, voltaire, wrote, candide, but, scholars, estimate, that, it, was, primarily, composed, in, late, 1758, and, begun, as, early, as, 1757, voltaire, is, believed, to, have, written, a, portion, of, it, while, living, at, les, d, lices, near, geneva, and, also, while, visiting, charles, th, odore, the, elector, palatinate, at, schwetzingen, for, three, weeks, in, the, summer, of, 1758, despite, solid, evidence, for, these, claims, a, popular, legend, persists, that, voltaire, wrote, candide, in, three, days, this, idea, is, probably, based, on, a, misreading, of, the, 1885, work, la, vie, intime, de, voltaire, aux, d, lices, et, ferney, by, lucien, perey, real, name, clara, ad, le, luce, herpin, and, gaston, maugras, the, evidence, indicates, strongly, that, voltaire, did, not, rush, or, improvise, candide, but, worked, on, it, over, a, significant, period, of, time, possibly, even, a, whole, year, candide, is, mature, and, carefully, developed, not, impromptu, as, the, intentionally, choppy, plot, and, the, aforementioned, myth, might, suggest, there, is, only, one, extant, manuscript, of, candide, that, was, written, before, the, work, s, 1759, publication, it, was, discovered, in, 1956, by, wade, and, since, named, the, la, valli, re, manuscript, it, is, believed, to, have, been, sent, chapter, by, chapter, by, voltaire, to, the, duke, and, duchess, la, valli, re, in, the, autumn, of, 1758, the, manuscript, was, sold, to, the, biblioth, que, de, l, arsenal, in, the, late, eighteenth, century, where, it, remained, undiscovered, for, almost, two, hundred, years, the, la, valli, re, manuscript, the, most, original, and, authentic, of, all, surviving, copies, of, candide, was, probably, dictated, by, voltaire, to, his, secretary, jean, louis, wagni, re, then, edited, directly, in, addition, to, this, manuscript, there, is, believed, to, have, been, another, one, copied, by, wagni, re, for, the, elector, charles, th, odore, who, hosted, voltaire, during, the, summer, of, 1758, the, existence, of, this, copy, was, first, postulated, by, norman, l, torrey, in, 1929, if, it, exists, it, remains, undiscovered, voltaire, published, candide, simultaneously, in, five, countries, no, later, than, 15, january, 1759, although, the, exact, date, is, uncertain, seventeen, versions, of, candide, from, 1759, in, the, original, french, are, known, today, and, there, has, been, great, controversy, over, which, is, the, earliest, more, versions, were, published, in, other, languages, candide, was, translated, once, into, italian, and, thrice, into, english, that, same, year, the, complicated, science, of, calculating, the, relative, publication, dates, of, all, of, the, versions, of, candide, is, described, at, length, in, wade, s, article, the, first, edition, of, candide, a, problem, of, identification, the, publication, process, was, extremely, secretive, probably, the, most, clandestine, work, of, the, century, because, of, the, book, s, obviously, illicit, and, irreverent, content, the, greatest, number, of, copies, of, candide, were, published, concurrently, in, geneva, by, cramer, in, amsterdam, by, marc, michel, rey, in, london, by, jean, nourse, and, in, paris, by, lambert, candide, underwent, one, major, revision, after, its, initial, publication, in, addition, to, some, minor, ones, in, 1761, a, version, of, candide, was, published, that, included, along, with, several, minor, changes, a, major, addition, by, voltaire, to, the, twenty, second, chapter, a, section, that, had, been, thought, weak, by, the, duke, of, valli, re, the, english, title, of, this, edition, was, candide, or, optimism, translated, from, the, german, of, dr, ralph, with, the, additions, found, in, the, doctor, s, pocket, when, he, died, at, minden, in, the, year, of, grace, 1759, the, last, edition, of, candide, authorised, by, voltaire, was, the, one, included, in, cramer, s, 1775, edition, of, his, complete, works, known, as, l, dition, encadr, e, in, reference, to, the, border, or, frame, around, each, page, voltaire, strongly, opposed, the, inclusion, of, illustrations, in, his, works, as, he, stated, in, a, 1778, letter, to, the, writer, and, publisher, charles, joseph, panckoucke, je, crois, que, des, estampes, seraient, fort, inutiles, ces, colifichets, n, ont, jamais, t, admis, dans, les, ditions, de, cic, ron, de, virgile, et, d, horace, i, believe, that, these, illustrations, would, be, quite, useless, these, baubles, have, never, been, allowed, in, the, works, of, cicero, virgil, and, horace, despite, this, protest, two, sets, of, illustrations, for, candide, were, produced, by, the, french, artist, jean, michel, moreau, le, jeune, the, first, version, was, done, at, moreau, s, own, expense, in, 1787, and, included, in, kehl, s, publication, of, that, year, oeuvres, compl, tes, de, voltaire, four, images, were, drawn, by, moreau, for, this, edition, and, were, engraved, by, pierre, charles, baquoy, the, second, version, in, 1803, consisted, of, seven, drawings, by, moreau, which, were, transposed, by, multiple, engravers, the, twentieth, century, modern, artist, paul, klee, stated, that, it, was, while, reading, candide, that, he, discovered, his, own, artistic, style, klee, illustrated, the, work, and, his, drawings, were, published, in, a, 1920, version, edited, by, kurt, wolff, candide, contains, thirty, episodic, chapters, which, may, be, grouped, into, two, main, schemes, one, consists, of, two, divisions, separated, by, the, protagonist, s, hiatus, in, el, dorado, the, other, consists, of, three, parts, each, defined, by, its, geographical, setting, by, the, former, scheme, the, first, half, of, candide, constitutes, the, rising, action, and, the, last, part, the, resolution, this, view, is, supported, by, the, strong, theme, of, travel, and, quest, reminiscent, of, adventure, and, picaresque, novels, which, tend, to, employ, such, a, dramatic, structure, by, the, latter, scheme, the, thirty, chapters, may, be, grouped, into, three, parts, each, comprising, ten, chapters, and, defined, by, locale, i, x, are, set, in, europe, xi, xx, are, set, in, the,

because, after, all, i, m, a, philosopher, and, it, wouldn, t, be, proper, for, me, to, recant, since, leibniz, cannot, be, wrong, and, since, pre, established, harmony, is, the, most, beautiful, thing, in, the, world, along, with, the, plenum, and, subtle, matter, candide, the, baron, pangloss, martin, and, cacambo, arrive, at, the, banks, of, the, propontis, where, they, rejoin, cun, gonde, and, the, old, woman, cun, gonde, has, indeed, become, hideously, ugly, but, candide, nevertheless, buys, their, freedom, and, marries, cun, gonde, to, spite, her, brother, who, forbids, cun, gonde, from, marrying, anyone, but, a, baron, of, the, empire, he, is, secretly, sold, back, into, slavery, paquette, and, brother, girofl, e, having, squandered, their, three, thousand, piastres, are, reconciled, with, candide, on, a, small, farm, une, petite, m, tairie, which, he, just, bought, with, the, last, of, his, finances, one, day, the, protagonists, seek, out, a, dervish, known, as, a, great, philosopher, of, the, land, candide, asks, him, why, man, is, made, to, suffer, so, and, what, they, all, ought, to, do, the, dervish, responds, by, asking, rhetorically, why, candide, is, concerned, about, the, existence, of, evil, and, good, the, dervish, describes, human, beings, as, mice, on, a, ship, sent, by, a, king, to, egypt, their, comfort, does, not, matter, to, the, king, the, dervish, then, slams, his, door, on, the, group, returning, to, their, farm, candide, pangloss, and, martin, meet, a, turk, whose, philosophy, is, to, devote, his, life, only, to, simple, work, and, not, concern, himself, with, external, affairs, he, and, his, four, children, cultivate, a, small, area, of, land, and, the, work, keeps, them, free, of, three, great, evils, boredom, vice, and, poverty, candide, pangloss, martin, cun, gonde, paquette, cacambo, the, old, woman, and, brother, girofl, e, all, set, to, work, on, this, commendable, plan, louable, dessein, on, their, farm, each, exercising, his, or, her, own, talents, candide, ignores, pangloss, s, insistence, that, all, turned, out, for, the, best, by, necessity, instead, telling, him, we, must, cultivate, our, garden, il, faut, cultiver, notre, jardin, as, voltaire, himself, described, it, the, purpose, of, candide, was, to, bring, amusement, to, a, small, number, of, men, of, wit, the, author, achieves, this, goal, by, combining, wit, with, a, parody, of, the, classic, adventure, romance, plot, candide, is, confronted, with, horrible, events, described, in, painstaking, detail, so, often, that, it, becomes, humorous, literary, theorist, frances, k, barasch, described, voltaire, s, matter, of, fact, narrative, as, treating, topics, such, as, mass, death, as, coolly, as, a, weather, report, the, fast, paced, and, improbable, plot, in, which, characters, narrowly, escape, death, repeatedly, for, instance, allows, for, compounding, tragedies, to, befall, the, same, characters, over, and, over, again, in, the, end, candide, is, primarily, as, described, by, voltaire, s, biographer, ian, davidson, short, light, rapid, and, humorous, behind, the, playful, fa, ade, of, candide, which, has, amused, so, many, there, lies, very, harsh, criticism, of, contemporary, european, civilization, which, angered, many, others, european, governments, such, as, france, prussia, portugal, and, england, are, each, attacked, ruthlessly, by, the, author, the, french, and, prussians, for, the, seven, years, war, the, portuguese, for, their, inquisition, and, the, british, for, the, execution, of, john, byng, organised, religion, too, is, harshly, treated, in, candide, for, example, voltaire, mocks, the, jesuit, order, of, the, roman, catholic, church, aldridge, provides, a, characteristic, example, of, such, anti, clerical, passages, for, which, the, work, was, banned, while, in, paraguay, cacambo, remarks, are, masters, of, everything, and, the, people, have, no, money, at, all, here, voltaire, suggests, the, christian, mission, in, paraguay, is, taking, advantage, of, the, local, population, voltaire, depicts, the, jesuits, holding, the, indigenous, peoples, as, slaves, while, they, claim, to, be, helping, them, the, main, method, of, candide, s, satire, is, to, contrast, ironically, great, tragedy, and, comedy, the, story, does, not, invent, or, exaggerate, evils, of, the, world, it, displays, real, ones, starkly, allowing, voltaire, to, simplify, subtle, philosophies, and, cultural, traditions, highlighting, their, flaws, thus, candide, derides, optimism, for, instance, with, a, deluge, of, horrible, historical, or, at, least, plausible, events, with, no, apparent, redeeming, qualities, a, simple, example, of, the, satire, of, candide, is, seen, in, the, treatment, of, the, historic, event, witnessed, by, candide, and, martin, in, portsmouth, harbour, there, the, duo, spy, an, anonymous, admiral, supposed, to, represent, john, byng, being, executed, for, failing, to, properly, engage, a, french, fleet, the, admiral, is, blindfolded, and, shot, on, the, deck, of, his, own, ship, merely, to, encourage, the, others, french, pour, encourager, les, autres, an, expression, voltaire, is, credited, with, originating, this, depiction, of, military, punishment, trivializes, byng, s, death, the, dry, pithy, explanation, to, encourage, the, others, thus, satirises, a, serious, historical, event, in, characteristically, voltairian, fashion, for, its, classic, wit, this, phrase, has, become, one, of, the, more, often, quoted, from, candide, voltaire, depicts, the, worst, of, the, world, and, his, pathetic, hero, s, desperate, effort, to, fit, it, into, an, optimistic, outlook, almost, all, of, candide, is, a, discussion, of, various, forms, of, evil, its, characters, rarely, find, even, temporary, respite, there, is, at, least, one, notable, exception, the, episode, of, el, dorado, a, fantastic, village, in, which, the, inhabitants, are, simply, rational, and, their, society, is, just, and, reasonable, the, positivity, of, el, dorado, may, be, contrasted, with, the, pessimistic, attitude, of, most, of, the, book, even, in, this, case, the, bliss, of, el, dorado, is, fleeting, candide, soon, leaves, the, village, to, seek, cun, gonde, whom, he, eventually, marries, only, out, of, a, sense, of, obligation, another, element, of, the, satire, focuses, on, what, william, f, bottiglia, author, of, many, published, works, on, candide, calls, the, sentimental, foibles, of, the, age, and, voltaire, s, attack, on, them, flaws, in, european, culture, are, highlighted, as, candide, parodies, adventure, and, romance, clich, s, mimicking, the, style, of, a, picaresque, novel, a, number, of, archetypal, characters, thus, have, recognisable, manifestations, in, voltaire, s, work, candide, is, supposed, to, be, the, drifting, rogue, of, low, social, class, cun, gonde, the, sex, interest, pangloss, the, knowledgeable, mentor, and, cacambo, the, skillful, valet, as, the, plot, unfolds, readers, find, that, candide, is, no, rogue, cun, gonde, becomes, ugly, and, pangloss, is, a, stubborn, fool, the, characters, of, candide, are, unrealistic, two, dimensional, mechanical, and, even, marionette, like, they, are, simplistic, and, stereotypical, as, the, initially, na, ve, protagonist, eventually, comes, to, a, mature, conclusion, however, noncommittal, the, novella, is, a, bildungsroman, if, not, a, very, serious, one, gardens, are, thought, by, many, critics, to, play, a, critical, symbolic, role, in, candide, the, first, location, commonly, identified, as, a, garden, is, the, castle, of, the, baron, from, which, candide, and, cun, gonde, are, evicted, much, in, the, same, fashion, as, adam, and, eve, are, evicted, from, the, garden, of, eden, in, the, book, of, genesis, cyclically, the, main, characters, of, candide, conclude, the, novel, in, a, garden, of, their, own, making, one, which, might, represent, celestial, paradise, the, third, most, prominent, garden, is, el, dorado, which, may, be, a, false, eden, other, possibly, symbolic, gardens, include, the, jesuit, pavilion, the, garden, of, pococurante, cacambo, s, garden, and, the, turk, s, garden, these, gardens, are, probably, references, to, the, garden, of, eden, but, it, has, also, been, proposed, by, bottiglia, for, example, that, the, gardens, refer, also, to, the, encyclop, die, and, that, candide, s, conclusion, to, cultivate, his, garden, symbolises, voltaire, s, great, support, for, this, endeavour, candide, and, his, companions, as, they, find, themselves, at, the, end, of, the, novella, are, in, a, very, similar, position, to, voltaire, s, tightly, knit, philosophical, circle, which, supported, the, encyclop, die, the, main, characters, of, candide, live, in, seclusion, to, cultivate, garden, just, as, voltaire, suggested, his, colleagues, leave, society, to, write, in, addition, there, is, evidence, in, the, epistolary, correspondence, of, voltaire, that, he, had, elsewhere, used, the, metaphor, of, gardening, to, describe, writing, the, encyclop, die, another, interpretative, possibility, is, that, candide, cultivating, his, garden, suggests, his, engaging, in, only, necessary, occupations, such, as, feeding, oneself, and, fighting, boredom, this, is, analogous, to, voltaire, s, own, view, on, gardening, he, was, himself, a, gardener, at, his, estates, in, les, d, lices, and, ferney, and, he, often, wrote, in, his, correspondence, that, gardening, was, an, important, pastime, of, his, own, it, being, an, extraordinarily, effective, way, to, keep, busy, candide, satirises, various, philosophical, and, religious, theories, that, voltaire, had, previously, criticised, primary, among, these, is, leibnizian, optimism, sometimes, called, panglossianism, after, its, fictional, proponent, which, voltaire, ridicules, with, descriptions, of, seemingly, endless, calamity, voltaire, demonstrates, a, variety, of, irredeemable, evils, in, the, world, leading, many, critics, to, contend, that, voltaire, s, treatment, of, evil, specifically, the, theological, problem, of, its, existence, is, the, focus, of, the, work, heavily, referenced, in, the, text, are, the, lisbon, earthquake, disease, and, the, sinking, of, ships, in, storms, also, war, thievery, and, murder, evils, of, human, design, are, explored, as, extensively, in, candide, as, are, environmental, ills, bottiglia, notes, voltaire, is, comprehensive, in, his, enumeration, of, the, world, s, evils, he, is, unrelenting, in, attacking, leibnizian, optimism, fundamental, to, voltaire, s, attack, is, candide, s, tutor, pangloss, a, self, proclaimed, follower, of, leibniz, and, a, teacher, of, his, doctrine, ridicule, of, pangloss, s, theories, thus, ridicules, leibniz, himself, and, pangloss, s, reasoning, is, silly, at, best, for, example, pangloss, s, first, teachings, of, the, narrative, absurdly, mix, up, cause, and, effect, il, est, d, montr, disait, il, que, les, choses, ne, peuvent, tre, autrement, car, tout, tant, fait, pour, une, fin, tout, est, n, cessairement, pour, la, meilleure, fin, remarquez, bien, que, les, nez, ont, t, faits, pour, porter, des, lunettes, aussi, avons, nous, des, lunettes, it, is, demonstrable, that, things, cannot, be, otherwise, than, as, they, are, for, as, all, things, have, been, created, for, some, end, they, must, necessarily, be, created, for, the, best, end, observe, for, instance, the, nose, is, formed, for, spectacles, therefore, we, wear, spectacles, following, such, flawed, reasoning, even, more, doggedly, than, candide, pangloss, defends, optimism, whatever, their, horrendous, fortune, pangloss, reiterates, all, is, for, the, best, tout, est, pour, le, mieux, and, proceeds, to, justify, the, evil, event, s, occurrence, a, characteristic, example, of, such, theodicy, is, found, in, pangloss, s, explanation, of, why, it, is, good, that, syphilis, exists, c, tait, une, chose, indispensable, dans, le, meilleur, des, mondes, un, ingr, dient, n, cessaire, car, si, colomb, n, avait, pas, attrap, dans, une, le, de, l, am, rique, cette, maladie, qui, empoisonne, la, source, de, la, g, n, ration, qui, souvent, m, me, emp, che, la, g, n, ration, et, qui, est, videmment, l, oppos, du, grand, but, de, la, nature, nous, n, aurions, ni, le, chocolat, ni, la, cochenille, it, was, a, thing, unavoidable, a, necessary, ingredient, in, the, best, of, worlds, for, if, columbus, had, not, caught, in, an, island, in, america, this, disease, which, contaminates, the, source, of, generation, and, frequently, impedes, propagation, itself, and, is, evidently, opposed, to, the, great, end, of, nature, we, should, have, had, neither, chocolate, nor, cochineal, candide, the, impressionable, and, incompetent, student, of, pangloss, often, tries, to, justify, evil, fails, invokes, his, mentor, and, eventually, despairs, it, is, by, these, failures, that, candide, is, painfully, cured, as, voltaire, would, see, it, of, his, optimism, this, critique, of, voltaire, s, seems, to, be, directed, almost, exclusively, at, leibnizian, optimism, candide, does, not, ridicule, voltaire, s, contemporary, alexander, pope, a, later, optimist, of, slightly, different, convictions, candide, does, not, discuss, pope, s, optimistic, principle, that, all, is, right, but, leibniz, s, that, states, this, is, the, best, of, all, possible, worlds, however, subtle, the, difference, between, the, two, candide, is, unambiguous, as, to, which, is, its, subject, some, critics, conjecture, that, voltaire, meant, to, spare, pope, this, ridicule, out, of, respect, although, voltaire, s, po, me, may, have, been, written, as, a, more, direct, response, to, pope, s, theories, this, work, is, similar, to, candide, in, subject, matter, but, very, different, from, it, in, style, the, po, me, embodies, a, more, serious, philosophical, argument, than, candide, the, conclusion, of, the, novel, in, which, candide, finally, dismisses, his, tutor, s, optimism, leaves, unresolved, what, philosophy, the, protagonist, is, to, accept, in, its, stead, this, element, of, candide, has, been, written, about, voluminously, perhaps, above, all, others, the, conclusion, is, enigmatic, and, its, analysis, is, contentious, voltaire, develops, no, formal, systematic, philosophy, for, the, characters, to, adopt, the, conclusion, of, the, novel, may, be, thought, of, not, as, a, philosophical, alternative, to, optimism, but, as, a, prescribed, practical, outlook, though, what, it, prescribes, is, in, dispute, many, critics, have, concluded, that, one, minor, character, or, another, is, portrayed, as, having, the, right, philosophy, for, instance, a, number, believe, that, martin, is, treated, sympathetically, and, that, his, character, holds, voltaire, s, ideal, philosophy, pessimism, others, disagree, citing, voltaire, s, negative, descriptions, of, martin, s, principles, and, the, conclusion, of, the, work, in, which, martin, plays, little, part, within, debates, attempting, to, decipher, the, conclusion, of, candide, lies, another, primary, candide, debate, this, one, concerns, the, degree, to, which, voltaire, was, advocating, a, pessimistic, philosophy, by, which, candide, and, his, companions, give, up, hope, for, a, better, world, critics, argue, that, the, group, s, reclusion, on, the, farm, signifies, candide, and, his, companions, loss, of, hope, for, the, rest, of, the, human, race, this, view, is, to, be, compared, to, a, reading, that, presents, voltaire, as, advocating, a, melioristic, philosophy, and, a, precept, committing, the, travellers, to, improving, the, world, through, metaphorical, gardening, this, debate, and, others, focuses, on, the, question, of, whether, or, not, voltaire, was, prescribing, passive, retreat, from, society, or, active, industrious, contribution, to, it, separate, from, the, debate, about, the, text, s, conclusion, is, the, inside, outside, controversy, this, argument, centers, on, the, matter, of, whether, or, not, voltaire, was, actually, prescribing, anything, roy, wolper, professor, emeritus, of, english, argues, in, a, revolutionary, 1969, paper, that, candide, does, not, necessarily, speak, for, its, author, that, the, work, should, be, viewed, as, a, narrative, independent, of, voltaire, s, history, and, that, its, message, is, entirely, or, mostly, inside, it, this, point, of, view, the, inside, specifically, rejects, attempts, to, find, voltaire, s, voice, in, the, many, characters, of, candide, and, his, other, works, indeed, writers, have, seen, voltaire, as, speaking, through, at, least, candide, martin, and, the, turk, wolper, argues, that, candide, should, be, read, with, a, minimum, of, speculation, as, to, its, meaning, in, voltaire, s, personal, life, his, article, ushered, in, a, new, era, of, voltaire, studies, causing, many, scholars, to, look, at, the, novel, differently, critics, such, as, lester, crocker, henry, stavan, and, vivienne, mylne, find, too, many, similarities, between, candide, s, point, of, view, and, that, of, voltaire, to, accept, the, inside, view, they, support, the, outside, interpretation, they, believe, that, candide, s, final, decision, is, the, same, as, voltaire, s, and, see, a, strong, connection, between, the, development, of, the, protagonist, and, his, author, some, scholars, who, support, the, outside, view, also, believe, that, the, isolationist, philosophy, of, the, old, turk, closely, mirrors, that, of, voltaire, others, see, a, strong, parallel, between, candide, s, gardening, at, the, conclusion, and, the, gardening, of, the, author, martine, darmon, meyer, argues, that, the, inside, view, fails, to, see, the, satirical, work, in, context, and, that, denying, that, candide, is, primarily, a, mockery, of, optimism, a, matter, of, historical, context, is, a, very, basic, betrayal, of, the, text, de, roman, voltaire, en, a, fait, un, lequel, est, le, r, sum, de, toutes, ses, uvres, toute, son, intelligence, tait, une, machine, de, guerre, et, ce, qui, me, le, fait, ch, rir, c, est, le, d, go, t, que, m, inspirent, les, voltairiens, des, gens, qui, rient, sur, les, grandes, choses, est, ce, qu, il, riait, lui, il, grin, ait, flaubert, correspondance, d, conard, ii, 348, iii, 219, voltaire, made, with, this, novel, a, r, sum, of, all, his, works, his, whole, intelligence, was, a, war, machine, and, what, makes, me, cherish, it, is, the, disgust, which, has, been, inspired, in, me, by, the, voltairians, people, who, laugh, about, the, important, things, was, he, laughing, voltaire, he, was, screeching, flaubert, correspondance, d, conard, ii, 348, iii, 219, though, voltaire, did, not, openly, admit, to, having, written, the, controversial, candide, until, 1768, until, then, he, signed, with, a, pseudonym, monsieur, le, docteur, ralph, or, doctor, ralph, his, authorship, of, the, work, was, hardly, disputed, immediately, after, publication, the, work, and, its, author, were, denounced, by, both, secular, and, religious, authorities, because, the, book, openly, derides, government, and, church, alike, it, was, because, of, such, polemics, that, omer, louis, fran, ois, joly, de, fleury, who, was, advocate, general, to, the, parisian, parliament, when, candide, was, published, found, parts, of, candide, to, be, contrary, to, religion, and, morals, despite, much, official, indictment, soon, after, its, publication, candide, s, irreverent, prose, was, being, quoted, let, us, eat, a, jesuit, for, instance, became, a, popular, phrase, for, its, reference, to, a, humorous, passage, in, candide, by, the, end, of, february, 1759, the, grand, council, of, geneva, and, the, administrators, of, paris, had, banned, candide, candide, nevertheless, succeeded, in, selling, twenty, thousand, to, thirty, thousand, copies, by, the, end, of, the, year, in, more, than, twenty, editions, making, it, a, best, seller, the, duke, de, la, valli, re, speculated, near, the, end, of, january, 1759, that, candide, might, have, been, the, fastest, selling, book, ever, in, 1762, candide, was, listed, in, the, index, librorum, prohibitorum, the, roman, catholic, church, s, list, of, prohibited, books, bannings, of, candide, lasted, into, the, twentieth, century, in, the, united, states, where, it, has, long, been, considered, a, seminal, work, of, western, literature, at, least, once, candide, was, temporarily, barred, from, entering, america, in, february, 1929, a, us, customs, official, in, boston, prevented, a, number, of, copies, of, the, book, deemed, obscene, from, reaching, a, harvard, university, french, class, candide, was, admitted, in, august, of, the, same, year, however, by, that, time, the, class, was, over, in, an, interview, soon, after, candide, s, detention, the, official, who, confiscated, the, book, explained, the, office, s, decision, to, ban, it, but, about, candide, i, ll, tell, you, for, years, we, ve, been, letting, that, book, get, by, there, were, so, many, different, editions, all, sizes, and, kinds, some, illustrated, and, some, plain, that, we, figured, the, book, must, be, all, right, then, one, of, us, happened, to, read, it, it, s, a, filthy, book, candide, is, the, most, widely, read, of, voltaire, s, many, works, and, it, is, considered, one, of, the, great, achievements, of, western, literature, william, f, bottiglia, opines, the, physical, size, of, candide, as, well, as, voltaire, s, attitude, toward, his, fiction, precludes, the, achievement, of, artistic, dimension, through, plenitude, autonomous, 3d, vitality, emotional, resonance, or, poetic, exaltation, candide, then, cannot, in, quantity, or, quality, measure, up, to, the, supreme, classics, such, as, the, works, of, homer, or, shakespeare, sophocles, chaucer, dante, cervantes, fielding, goethe, dostoevsky, tolstoy, racine, or, moli, re, bottiglia, instead, calls, it, a, miniature, classic, but, others, have, been, more, forgiving, of, its, size, as, the, only, work, of, voltaire, which, has, remained, popular, up, to, the, present, day, candide, is, listed, in, harold, bloom, s, the, western, canon, the, books, and, school, of, the, ages, it, is, included, in, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, collection, great, books, of, the, western, world, candide, has, influenced, modern, writers, of, black, humour, such, as, c, line, joseph, heller, john, barth, thomas, pynchon, kurt, vonnegut, and, terry, southern, its, parody, and, picaresque, methods, have, become, favourites, of, black, humorists, charles, brockden, brown, an, early, american, novelist, may, have, been, directly, affected, by, voltaire, whose, work, he, knew, well, mark, kamrath, professor, of, english, describes, the, strength, of, the, connection, between, candide, and, brown, s, edgar, huntly, or, memoirs, of, a, sleep, walker, 1799, an, unusually, large, number, of, parallels, crop, up, in, the, two, novels, particularly, in, terms, of, characters, and, plot, for, instance, the, protagonists, of, both, novels, are, romantically, involved, with, a, recently, orphaned, young, woman, furthermore, in, both, works, the, brothers, of, the, female, lovers, are, jesuits, and, each, is, murdered, although, under, different, circumstances, some, twentieth, century, novels, that, may, have, been, influenced, by, candide, are, some, dystopian, science, fiction, works, armand, mattelart, a, french, critic, sees, candide, in, aldous, huxley, s, brave, new, world, george, orwell, s, nineteen, eighty, four, and, yevgeny, zamyatin, s, we, three, canonical, works, of, the, genre, specifically, mattelart, writes, that, in, each, of, these, works, there, exist, references, to, candide, s, popularisation, of, the, phrase, the, best, of, all, possible, worlds, he, cites, as, evidence, for, example, that, the, french, version, of, brave, new, world, was, entitled, le, meilleur, des, mondes, lit, the, best, of, worlds, readers, of, candide, often, compare, it, with, certain, works, of, the, modern, genre, the, theatre, of, the, absurd, haydn, mason, a, voltaire, scholar, sees, in, candide, a, few, similarities, to, this, brand, of, literature, for, instance, he, notes, commonalities, of, candide, and, waiting, for, godot, 1952, in, both, of, these, works, and, in, a, similar, manner, friendship, provides, emotional, support, for, characters, when, they, are, confronted, with, harshness, of, their, existences, however, mason, qualifies, the, conte, must, not, be, seen, as, a, forerunner, of, the, absurd, in, modern, fiction, candide, s, world, has, many, ridiculous, and, meaningless, elements, but, human, beings, are, not, totally, deprived, of, the, ability, to, make, sense, out, of, it, john, pilling, biographer, of, beckett, does, state, that, candide, was, an, early, and, powerful, influence, on, beckett, s, thinking, rosa, luxemburg, in, the, aftermath, of,
