the, impoverished, port, areas, of, these, countries, from, a, combination, of, argentine, milonga, spanish, cuban, habanera, and, uruguayan, candombe, celebrations, it, was, frequently, practiced, in, the, brothels, and, bars, of, ports, where, business, owners, employed, bands, to, entertain, their, patrons, it, then, spread, to, the, rest, of, the, world, many, variations, of, this, dance, currently, exist, around, the, world, on, august, 31, 2009, unesco, approved, a, joint, proposal, by, argentina, and, uruguay, to, include, the, tango, in, the, unesco, intangible, cultural, heritage, lists, tango, is, a, dance, that, has, influences, from, african, and, european, culture, dances, from, the, candombe, ceremonies, of, former, african, enslaved, people, helped, shape, the, modern, day, tango, the, dance, originated, in, working, class, districts, of, buenos, aires, and, montevideo, the, music, derived, from, the, fusion, of, various, forms, of, music, from, europe, the, words, tango, and, tambo, around, the, river, plate, basin, were, initially, used, to, refer, to, musical, gatherings, of, slaves, with, written, records, of, colonial, authorities, attempting, to, ban, such, gatherings, as, early, as, 1789, initially, it, was, just, one, of, the, many, dances, but, it, soon, became, popular, throughout, society, as, theatres, and, street, barrel, organs, spread, it, from, the, suburbs, to, the, working, class, slums, which, were, packed, with, hundreds, of, thousands, of, european, immigrants, when, the, tango, began, to, spread, internationally, around, 1900, cultural, norms, were, generally, conservative, and, so, tango, dancing, was, widely, regarded, as, extremely, sexual, and, inappropriate, for, public, display, this, led, to, a, phenomenon, of, culture, shock, additionally, the, combination, of, african, native, american, and, european, cultural, influences, in, tango, was, new, and, unusual, to, most, of, the, western, world, many, neighbourhoods, of, buenos, aires, have, their, particular, tango, histories, for, example, la, boca, san, telmo, and, boedo, at, boedo, avenue, c, tulo, castillo, homero, manzi, and, other, singers, and, composers, used, to, meet, at, the, japanese, cafe, with, the, boedo, group, in, the, early, years, of, the, 20th, century, dancers, and, orchestras, from, buenos, aires, travelled, to, europe, and, the, first, european, tango, craze, took, place, in, paris, soon, followed, by, london, berlin, and, other, capitals, tango, historian, nardo, zalko, a, native, of, buenos, aires, who, lived, most, of, his, life, in, paris, investigated, the, mutual, fertilization, between, the, two, cities, in, his, work, paris, buenos, aires, un, si, cle, de, tango, a, century, of, tango, towards, the, end, of, 1913, it, hit, new, york, city, as, well, as, finland, in, the, u, s, around, 1911, the, word, tango, was, often, applied, to, dances, in, a, 2, 4, or, 4, 4, rhythm, such, as, the, one, step, the, term, was, fashionable, and, did, not, indicate, that, tango, steps, would, be, used, in, the, dance, although, they, might, be, tango, music, was, sometimes, played, but, at, a, rather, fast, tempo, instructors, of, the, period, would, sometimes, refer, to, this, as, a, north, american, tango, versus, the, so, called, argentine, tango, the, tango, was, controversial, because, of, its, perceived, sexual, overtones, and, by, the, end, of, 1913, the, dance, teachers, who, had, introduced, the, dance, to, paris, were, banished, from, the, city, by, 1914, more, authentic, tango, stylings, were, soon, developed, along, with, some, variations, like, albert, newman, s, minuet, tango, in, argentina, the, onset, in, 1929, of, the, great, depression, and, restrictions, introduced, after, the, overthrow, of, the, hip, lito, yrigoyen, government, in, 1930, caused, a, temporary, decline, in, tango, s, popularity, its, fortunes, were, reversed, later, in, the, 1930s, and, tango, again, became, widely, fashionable, and, a, matter, of, national, pride, under, the, first, per, n, government, which, in, turn, had, a, major, effect, on, argentinian, culture, overall, mariano, mores, played, a, role, in, the, resurgence, of, the, tango, in, 1950s, argentina, mores, s, taquito, militar, was, premiered, in, 1952, during, a, governmental, speech, by, president, juan, d, per, n, which, generated, a, strong, political, and, cultural, controversy, between, different, views, of, the, concepts, of, cultured, music, and, popular, music, as, well, as, the, links, between, both, cultures, tango, declined, again, in, the, late, 1950s, as, a, result, of, economic, depression, and, the, banning, of, public, gatherings, by, the, military, dictatorships, male, only, tango, practice, the, custom, at, the, time, was, considered, public, gathering, that, indirectly, boosted, the, popularity, of, rock, and, roll, because, unlike, tango, it, did, not, require, such, gatherings, however, in, the, late, 1980s, the, tango, again, experienced, a, resurgence, in, argentina, partly, due, to, the, endeavors, of, osvaldo, peredo, in, 2009, the, tango, was, added, to, the, unesco, intangible, cultural, heritage, lists, there, are, several, theories, regarding, the, origin, of, the, word, tango, none, of, which, has, been, proven, an, african, culture, is, often, credited, as, the, creator, of, this, word, in, particular, it, is, theorized, that, the, word, derives, from, the, yoruba, word, shang, which, refers, to, shango, the, god, of, thunder, in, traditional, yoruba, religion, this, theory, suggests, that, the, word, shang, was, morphed, through, the, dilution, of, the, nigerian, language, once, it, reached, south, america, via, slave, trade, according, to, an, alternative, theory, tango, is, derived, from, the, spanish, word, for, drum, tambor, this, word, was, then, mispronounced, by, buenos, aires, lower, class, inhabitants, to, become, tambo, ultimately, resulting, in, the, common, tango, it, is, also, sometimes, theorized, that, the, word, is, derived, from, the, portuguese, word, tanger, which, means, to, play, a, musical, instrument, another, portuguese, word, tangom, o, a, combination, of, the, verb, tanger, to, touch, with, the, noun, m, o, hand, meaning, to, play, a, musical, instrument, with, one, s, hands, has, been, suggested, as, the, etymon, of, tango, according, to, some, authors, tango, is, derived, from, the, kongo, word, ntangu, which, means, sun, hour, space, time, the, tango, consists, of, a, variety, of, styles, that, developed, in, different, regions, and, eras, of, argentina, as, well, as, in, other, locations, around, the, world, the, dance, developed, in, response, to, many, cultural, elements, such, as, the, crowding, of, the, venue, and, even, the, fashions, in, clothing, the, styles, are, mostly, danced, in, either, open, embrace, where, lead, and, follow, have, space, between, their, bodies, or, close, embrace, where, the, lead, and, follow, connect, either, chest, to, chest, argentine, tango, or, in, the, upper, thigh, hip, area, american, and, international, tango,

footwork, it, is, based, on, the, petitero, or, caquero, style, of, the, crowded, downtown, clubs, of, the, 1950s, in, contrast, the, tango, that, originated, in, the, family, clubs, of, the, suburban, neighborhoods, villa, urquiza, devoto, avellaneda, etc, emphasizes, long, elegant, steps, and, complex, figures, in, this, case, the, embrace, may, be, allowed, to, open, briefly, to, permit, the, execution, of, the, complex, footwork, the, complex, figures, of, this, style, became, the, basis, for, a, theatrical, performance, style, of, tango, seen, in, the, touring, stage, shows,

from, the, tango, styles, that, developed, when, the, tango, first, went, abroad, to, europe, and, north, america, the, dance, was, simplified, adapted, to, the, preferences, of, conventional, ballroom, dancers, and, incorporated, into, the, repertoire, used, in, international, ballroom, dance, competitions, english, tango, was, first, codified, in, october, 1922, when, it, was, proposed, that, it, should, only, be, danced, to, modern, tunes, ideally, at, 30, bars, per, minute, i, e, 120, beats, per, minute, assuming, a, 4, 4, measure, subsequently, the, english, tango, evolved, mainly, as, a, highly, competitive, dance, while, the, american, tango, evolved, as, an, unjudged, social, dance, with, an, emphasis, on, leading, and, following, skills, this, has, led, to, some, principal, distinctions, in, basic, technique, and, style, nevertheless, there, are, quite, a, few, competitions, held, in, the, american, style, and, of, course, mutual, borrowing, of, technique, and, dance, patterns, happens, all, the, time, ballroom, tangos, use, different, music, and, styling, from, the, tangos, from, the, river, plata, region, uruguay, and, argentina, with, more, staccato, movements, and, the, characteristic, head, snaps, the, head, snaps, are, totally, foreign, to, argentine, and, uruguayan, tango, and, were, introduced, in, 1934, under, the, influence, of, a, similar, movement, in, the, legs, and, feet, of, the, tango, from, the, river, plate, and, the, theatrical, movements, of, the, pasodoble, this, style, became, very, popular, in, germany, and, was, soon, introduced, to, england, the, movements, were, very, popular, with, spectators, but, not, with, competition, judges, tango, arrived, in, finland, in, 1913, the, tango, spread, from, the, dominant, urban, dance, form, to, become, hugely, popular, across, finland, in, the, 1950s, after, world, war, i, and, world, war, ii, the, melancholy, tone, of, the, music, reflects, the, themes, of, finnish, folk, poetry, finnish, tango, is, almost, always, in, a, minor, key, the, tango, is, danced, in, very, close, full, thigh, pelvis, and, upper, body, contact, in, a, wide, and, strong, frame, and, features, smooth, horizontal, movements, that, are, very, strong, and, determined, dancers, are, very, low, allowing, long, steps, without, any, up, and, down, movement, although, rises, and, falls, are, optional, in, some, styles, forward, steps, land, heel, first, except, when, descending, from, a, rise, and, in, backward, steps, dancers, push, from, the, heel, in, basic, steps, the, passing, leg, moves, quickly, to, rest, for, a, moment, close, to, the, grounded, leg, dips, and, rotations, are, typical, there, is, no, open, position, and, typically, feet, stay, close, to, the, floor, except, in, dips, the, follower, might, slightly, raise, the, left, leg, unlike, in, some, argentine, uruguayan, tango, styles, in, finnish, tango, there, is, no, kicking, of, any, kind, and, there, are, no, aerials, the, annual, finnish, tango, festival, tangomarkkinat, draws, over, 100, 000, tango, fans, to, the, central, finnish, town, of, sein, joki, the, town, also, hosts, the, tango, museum, argentine, uruguayan, and, ballroom, tango, use, very, different, techniques, in, argentine, and, uruguayan, tango, the, body, s, center, moves, first, then, the, feet, reach, to, support, it, in, ballroom, tango, the, body, is, initially, set, in, motion, across, the, floor, through, the, flexing, of, the, lower, joints, hip, knee, ankle, while, the, feet, are, delayed, then, the, feet, move, quickly, to, catch, the, body, resulting, in, snatching, or, striking, action, that, reflects, the, staccato, nature, of, this, style, s, preferred, music, in, tango, the, steps, are, typically, more, gliding, but, can, vary, widely, in, timing, speed, and, character, and, follow, no, single, specific, rhythm, because, the, dance, is, led, and, followed, at, the, level, of, individual, steps, these, variations, can, occur, from, one, step, to, the, next, this, allows, the, dancers, to, vary, the, dance, from, moment, to, moment, to, match, the, music, which, often, has, both, legato, and, or, staccato, elements, and, their, mood, the, tango, s, frame, called, an, abrazo, or, embrace, is, not, rigid, but, flexibly, adjusts, to, different, steps, and, may, vary, from, being, quite, close, to, offset, in, a, v, frame, to, open, the, flexibility, is, as, important, as, is, all, movement, in, dance, the, american, ballroom, tango, s, frame, is, flexible, too, but, experienced, dancers, frequently, dance, in, closed, position, higher, in, the, elbows, tone, in, the, arms, and, constant, connection, through, the, body, when, dancing, socially, with, beginners, however, it, may, be, better, to, use, a, more, open, position, because, the, close, position, is, too, intimate, for, them, in, american, tango, open, position, may, result, in, open, breaks, pivots, and, turns, which, are, quite, foreign, in, argentine, tango, and, international, english, tango, there, is, a, closed, position, as, in, other, types, of, ballroom, dance, but, it, differs, significantly, between, types, of, tango, in, tango, from, the, river, plata, region, the, close, embrace, involves, continuous, contact, at, the, full, upper, body, but, not, the, legs, in, american, ballroom, tango, the, close, embrace, involves, close, contact, in, the, pelvis, or, upper, thighs, but, not, the, upper, body, followers, are, instructed, to, thrust, their, hips, forward, but, pull, their, upper, body, away, and, shyly, look, over, their, left, shoulder, when, they, are, led, into, a, corte, in, tango, from, the, river, plate, region, the, open, position, the, legs, may, be, intertwined, and, hooked, together, in, the, style, of, pulpo, the, octopus, in, pulpo, s, style, these, hooks, are, not, sharp, but, smooth, ganchos, in, tango, from, the, river, plate, the, ball, or, toe, of, the, foot, may, be, placed, first, alternatively, the, dancer, may, take, the, floor, with, the, entire, foot, in, a, cat, like, manner, in, the, international, style, of, tango, heel, leads, stepping, first, onto, the, heel, then, the, whole, foot, are, used, for, forward, steps, ballroom, tango, steps, stay, close, to, the, floor, while, the, river, plate, tango, uruguayan, and, argentine, includes, moves, such, as, the, boleo, allowing, momentum, to, carry, one, s, leg, into, the, air, and, gancho, hooking, one, s, leg, around, one, s, partner, s, leg, or, body, in, which, the, feet, travel, off, the, ground, both, uruguayan, and, argentine, tango, features, other, vocabulary, foreign, to, ballroom, such, as, the, parada, in, which, the, leader, puts, his, foot, against, the, follower, s, foot, the, arrastre, in, which, the, leader, appears, to, drag, or, be, dragged, by, the, follower, s, foot, and, several, kinds, of, sacada, in, which, the, leader, displaces, the, follower, s, leg, by, stepping, into, her, space, music, and, dance, elements, of, tango, are, popular, in, activities, related, to, gymnastics, figure, skating, synchronized, swimming, etc, because, of, its, dramatic, feeling, and, its, cultural, associations, with, romance, for, the, 1978, fifa, world, cup, in, argentina, adidas, designed, a, ball, and, named, it, tango, likely, a, tribute, to, the, host, country, of, the, event, this, design, was, also, used, in, 1982, fifa, world, cup, in, spain, as, tango, m, laga, and, in, 1984, and, 1988, uefa, european, football, championships, in, france, and, west, germany, tango, appears, in, different, aspects, of, society, regular, milongas, and, special, festivals, a, very, famous, festival, is, the, tango, buenos, aires, festival, y, mundial, in, buenos, aires, also, known, as, world, tango, dance, tournament, on, a, regional, level, there, are, also, many, festivals, inside, and, outside, of, argentina, one, local, festival, outside, argentina, is, buenos, aires, in, the, southern, highlands, in, australia, typically, the, tango, is, performed, between, a, man, and, a, woman, however, the, two, have, very, different, aspirations, within, the, tango, women, often, looked, to, the, tango, to, help, them, gain, confidence, and, to, help, them, find, a, potential, relationship, men, however, looked, to, the, tango, for, intimate, reasons, and, were, known, to, be, flirty, and, sexually, willing, women, however, were, primarily, focused, on, the, dance, itself, and, became, wealthy, as, time, went, on, and, the, tango, culture, changed, women, and, men, often, wanted, to, travel, and, compete, and, also, teach, tango, classes, and, then, both, women, and, men, are, viewed, as, equals, gender, roles, also, plays, a, big, part, in, the, mechanics, of, tango, due, to, the, tango, needing, a, leader, but, in, more, recent, times, this, is, being, challenged, due, to, woman, not, wanting, to, be, dependent, on, the, male, for, the, dance, in, the, early, 1900s, there, were, often, more, male, dancers, than, female, so, the, dance, was, performed, between, two, men, this, allowed, for, both, men, to, learn, the, leading, and, following, roles, of, tango, and, adapt, to, both, lead, equally, in, the, dance, this, changed, the, mechanics, of, the, dance, to, be, closer, to, two, equally, leading, roles, between, men, and, women, or, same, sex, pairs, a, queer, tango, movement, has, emerged, from, the, first, queer, tango, festival, held, in, hamburg, in, 2001, to, counter, conformity, to, the, traditional, male, leader, female, follower, convention, argentine, tango, is, the, main, subject, in, these, films, a, number, of, films, show, tango, in, several, scenes, such, as, finnish, tango, is, featured, to, a, greater, or, lesser, extent, in, the, following, films
