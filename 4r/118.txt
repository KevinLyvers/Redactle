may, be, literary, theatrical, musical, artistic, or, architectural, in, assessing, the, success, of, a, work, the, critic, takes, account, of, why, it, was, done, for, example, why, a, text, was,

and, thinking, to, substantiate, any, opinion, the, theory, of, criticism, is, an, area, of, study, in, itself, a, good, critic, understands, and, is, able, to, incorporate, the, theory, behind, the,

their, criticism, some, critics, are, poor, writers, and, produce, only, superficial, or, unsubstantiated, work, hence, while, anyone, can, be, an, uninformed, critic, the, notable, characteristics, of, a, good, critic, are, understanding, insight, and, an, ability, to, write, well, we, can, claim, with, at, least, as, much, accuracy, as, a, well, known, writer, claims, of, his, little, books, that, no, newspaper, would, dare, print, what, we, have, to, say, are, we, going, to, be, very, cruel, and, abusive, then, by, no, means, on, the, contrary, we, are, going, to, be, impartial, we,

of, editor, copy, editors, format, text, to, a, particular, style, and, or, correct, errors, in, grammar, and, spelling, without, changing, the, text, substantively, on, the, other, hand, an, editor, may, suggest, or, undertake, significant, changes, to, a, text, to, improve, its, readability, sense, or, structure, this, latter, type, of, editor, can, go, so, far, as, to, excise, some, parts, of, the, text, add, new, parts, or, restructure, the, whole, the, work, of, editors, of, ancient, texts, or, manuscripts, or, collections, of, works, results, in, differing, editions, for, example, there, are, many, editions, of, shakespeare, s, plays, by, notable, editors, who, also, contribute, original, introductions, to, the, resulting, publication, editors, who, work, on, journals, and, newspapers, have, varying, levels, of, responsibility, for, the, text, they, may, write, original, material, in, particular, editorials, select, what, is, to, be, included, from, a, range, of, items, on, offer, format, the, material, and, or, fact, check, its, accuracy, encyclopaedists, create, organised, bodies, of, knowledge, denis, diderot, 1713, 1784, is, renowned, for, his, contributions, to,

are, original, pieces, of, writing, of, moderate, length, in, which, the, author, makes, a, case, in, support, of, an, opinion, they, are, usually, in, prose, but, some, writers, have, used, poetry, to, present, their, argument, a, historian, is, a, person, who, studies, and, writes, about, the, past, and, is, regarded, as, an, authority, on, it, the, purpose, of, a, historian, is, to, employ, historical, analysis, to, create, coherent, narratives, that, explain, what, happened, and, why, or, how, it, happened, professional, historians, typically, work, in, colleges, and, universities, archival, centers, government, agencies, museums, and, as, freelance, writers, and, consultants, edward, gibbon, s, six, volume, history, of, the, decline, and, fall, of, the, roman, empire, influenced, the, development, of, historiography, writers, who, create, dictionaries, are, called, lexicographers, one, of, the, most, famous, is, samuel, johnson, 1709, 1784, whose, dictionary, of, the, english, language, was, regarded, not, only, as, a, great, personal, scholarly, achievement, but, was, also, a, dictionary, of, such, pre, eminence, that, would, have, been, referred, to, by, such, writers, as, jane, austen, researchers, and, scholars, who, write, about, their, discoveries, and, ideas, sometimes, have, profound, effects, on, society, scientists, and, philosophers, are, good, examples, because, their, new, ideas, can, revolutionise, the, way, people, think, and, how, they, behave, three, of, the, best, known, examples, of, such, a, revolutionary, effect, are, nicolaus, copernicus, who, wrote, de, revolutionibus, orbium, coelestium, 1543, charles, darwin, who, wrote, on, the, origin, of, species, 1859, and, sigmund, freud, who, wrote, the, interpretation, of, dreams, 1899, these, three, highly, influential, and, initially, very, controversial, works, changed, the, way, people, understood, their, place, in, the, world, copernicus, s, heliocentric, view, of, the, cosmos, displaced, humans, from, their, previously, accepted, place, at, the, center, of, the, universe, darwin, s, evolutionary, theory, placed, humans, firmly, within, as, opposed, to, above, the, order, of, manner, and, freud, s, ideas, about, the, power, of, the, unconscious, mind, overcame, the, belief, that, humans, were, consciously, in, control, of, all, their, own, actions, translators, have, the, task, of, finding, some, equivalence, in, another, language, to, a, writer, s, meaning, intention, and, style, translators, whose, work, has, had, very, significant, cultural, effect, include, al, ajj, j, ibn, y, suf, ibn, ma, ar, who, translated, elements, from, greek, into, arabic, and, jean, fran, ois, champollion, who, deciphered, egyptian, hieroglyphs, with, the, result, that, he, could, publish, the, first, translation, of, the, rosetta, stone, hieroglyphs, in, 1822, difficulties, with, translation, are, exacerbated, when, words, or, phrases, incorporate, rhymes, rhythms, or, puns, or, when, they, have, connotations, in, one, language, that, are, non, existent, in, another, for, example, the, title, of, le, grand, meaulnes, by, alain, fournier, is, supposedly, untranslatable, because, no, english, adjective, will, convey, all, the, shades, of, meaning, that, can, be, read, into, the, simple, word, grand, which, takes, on, overtones, as, the, story, progresses, translators, have, also, become, a, part, of, events, where, political, figures, who, speak, different, languages, meet, to, look, into, the, relations, between, countries, or, solve, political, conflicts, it, is, highly, critical, for, the, translator, to, deliver, the, right, information, as, a, drastic, impact, could, be, caused, if, any, error, occurred, even, if, translation, is, impossible, we, have, no, choice, but, to, do, it, to, take, the, next, step, and, start, translating, the, translator, s, task, is, to, make, us, either, forget, or, else, enjoy, the, difference, robert, dessaix, translator, author, writers, of, blogs, which, have, appeared, on, the, world, wide, web, since, the, 1990s, need, no, authorisation, to, be, published, the, contents, of, these, short, opinion, pieces, or, posts, form, a, commentary, on, issues, of, specific, interest, to, readers, who, can, use, the, same, technology, to, interact, with, the, author, with, an, immediacy, hitherto, impossible, the, ability, to, link, to, other, sites, means, that, some, blog, writers, and, their, writing, may, become, suddenly, and, unpredictably, popular, malala, yousafzai, a, young, pakistani, education, activist, rose, to, prominence, due, to, her, blog, for, bbc, a, blog, writer, is, using, the, technology, to, create, a, message, that, is, in, some, ways, like, a, newsletter, and, in, other, ways, like, a, personal, letter, the, greatest, difference, between, a, blog, and, a, photocopied, school, newsletter, or, an, annual, family, letter, photocopied, and, mailed, to, a, hundred, friends, is, the, potential, audience, and, the, increased, potential, for, direct, communication, between, audience, members, thus, as, with, other, forms, of, letters, the, writer, knows, some, of, the, readers, but, one, of, the, main, differences, is, that, some, of, the, audience, will, be, random, and, that, presumably, changes, the, way, we, write, it, has, been, argued, that, blogs, owe, a, debt, to, renaissance, essayist, michel, de, montaigne, whose, essais, attempts, were, published, in, 1580, because, montaigne, wrote, as, if, he, were, chatting, to, his, readers, just, two, friends, whiling, away, an, afternoon, in, conversation, columnists, write, regular, parts, for, newspapers, and, other, periodicals, usually, containing, a, lively, and, entertaining, expression, of, opinion, some, columnists, have, had, collections, of, their, best, work, published, as, a, collection, in, a, book, so, that, readers, can, re, read, what, would, otherwise, be, no, longer, available, columns, are, quite, short, pieces, of, writing, so, columnists, often, write, in, other, genres, as, well, an, example, is, the, female, columnist, elizabeth, farrelly, who, besides, being, a, columnist, is, also, an, architecture, critic, and, author, of, books, writers, who, record, their, experiences, thoughts, or, emotions, in, a, sequential, form, over, a, period, of, time, in, a, diary, are, known, as, diarists, their, writings, can, provide, valuable, insights, into, historical, periods, specific, events, or, individual, personalities, examples, include, samuel, pepys, 1633, 1703, an, english, administrator, and, member, of, parliament, whose, detailed, private, diary, provides, eyewitness, accounts, of, events, during, the, 17th, century, most, notably, of, the, great, fire, of, london, anne, frank, 1929, 1945, was, a, 13, year, old, dutch, girl, whose, diary, from, 1942, to, 1944, records, both, her, experiences, as, a, persecuted, jew, in, world, war, ii, and, an, adolescent, dealing, with, intra, family, relationships, journalists, write, reports, about, current, events, after, investigating, them, and, gathering, information, some, journalists, write, reports, about, predictable, or, scheduled, events, such, as, social, or, political, meetings, others, are, investigative, journalists, who, need, to, undertake,

are, reporting, criminal, or, corrupt, activity, which, puts, them, at, risk, personally, and, means, that, what, it, is, likely, that, attempts, may, be, made, to, attack, or, suppress, what, they, write, an, example, is, bob, woodward, a, journalist, who, investigated, and, wrote, about, criminal, activities, by, the, us, president, journalism, is, a, public, trust, a, responsibility, to,

scandalous, enough, to, be, of, interest, to, general, readers, although, meant, to, be, factual, readers, are, alerted, to, the, likelihood, of, some, inaccuracies, or, bias, towards, an, idiosyncratic, perception, by, the, choice, of, genre, a, memoir, for, example, is, allowed, to, have, a, much, more, selective, set, of, experiences, than, an, autobiography, which, is, expected, to, be, more, complete, and, make, a, greater, attempt, at, balance, well, known, memoirists, include, frances, vane, viscountess, vane, and, giacomo, casanova, ghostwriters, write, for, or, in, the, style, of, someone, else, so, the, credit, goes, to, the, person, on, whose, behalf, the, writing, is, done, writers, of, letters, use, a, reliable, form, of, transmission, of, messages, between, individuals, and, surviving, sets, of, letters, provide, insight, into, the, motivations, cultural, contexts, and, events, in, the, lives, of, their, writers, peter, abelard, 1079, 1142, philosopher, logician, and, theologian, is, known, not, only, for, the, heresy, contained, in, some, of, his, work, and, the, punishment, of, having, to, burn, his, own, book, but, also, for, the, letters, he, wrote, to, h, lo, se, d, argenteuil, 1090, 1164, the, letters, or, epistles, of, paul, the, apostle, were, so, influential, that, over, the, two, thousand, years, of, christian, history, paul, became, second, only, to, jesus, in, influence, and, the, amount, of, discussion, and, interpretation, generated, report, writers, are, people, who, gather, information, organise, and, document, it, so, that, it, can, be, presented, to, some, person, or, authority, in, a, position, to, use, it, as, the, basis, of, a, decision, well, written, reports, influence, policies, as, well, as, decisions, for, example, florence, nightingale, 1820, 1910, wrote, reports, that, were, intended, to, effect, administrative, reform, in, matters, concerning, health, in, the, army, she, documented, her, experience, in, the, crimean, war, and, showed, her, determination, to, see, improvements, after, six, months, of, incredible, industry, she, had, put, together, and, written, with, her, own, hand, her, notes, affecting, the, health, efficiency, and, hospital, administration, of, the, british, army, this, extraordinary, composition, filling, more, than, eight, hundred, closely, printed, pages, laying, down, vast, principles, of, far, reaching, reform, discussing, the, minutest, detail, of, a, multitude, of, controversial, subjects, containing, an, enormous, mass, of, information, of, the, most, varied, kinds, military, statistical, sanitary, architectural, became, for, a, long, time, the, leading, authority, on, the, medical, administration, of, armies, the, logs, and, reports, of, master, mariner,

another, sometimes, copying, from, another, document, sometimes, from, oral, instruction, on, behalf, of, an, illiterate, person, sometimes, transcribing, from, another, medium, such, as, a, tape, recording, shorthand, or, personal, notes, being, able, to, write, was, a, rare, achievement, for, over, 500, years, in, western, europe, so, monks, who, copied, texts, were, scribes, responsible, for, saving, many, texts, from, first, times, the, monasteries, where, monks, who, knew, how, to, read, and, write, lived, provided, an, environment, stable, enough, for, writing, irish, monks, for, example, came, to, europe, in, about, 600, and, found, manuscripts, in, places, like, tours, and, toulouse, which, they, copied, the, monastic, writers, also, illustrated, their, books, with, highly, skilled, art, work, using, gold, and, rare, colors, a, technical, writer, prepares, instructions, or, manuals, such, as, user, guides, or, owner, s, manuals, for, users, of, equipment, to, follow, technical, writers, also, write, different, procedures, for, business, professional, or, domestic, use, since, the, purpose, of, technical, writing, is, practical, rather, than, creative, its, most, important, quality, is, clarity, the, technical, writer, unlike, the, creative, writer, is, required, to, adhere, to, the, relevant, style, guide, there, is, a, range, of, approaches, that, writers, take, to, the, task, of, writing, each, writer, needs, to, find, their, own, process, and, most, describe, it, as, more, or, less, a, struggle, sometimes, writers, have, had, the, bad, fortune, to, lose, their, work, and, have, had, to, start, again, before, the, invention, of, photocopiers, and, electronic, text, storage, a, writer, s, work, had, to, be, stored, on, paper, which, meant, it, was, very, susceptible, to, fire, in, particular, in, very, earlier, times, writers, used, vellum, and, clay, which, were, more, robust, materials, writers, whose, work, was, destroyed, before, completion, include, l, l, zamenhof, the, inventor, of, esperanto, whose, years, of, work, were, thrown, into, the, fire, by, his, father, because, he, was, afraid, that, his, son, would, be, thought, a, spy, working, code, essayist, and, historian, thomas, carlyle, lost, the, only, copy, of, a, manuscript, for, the, french, revolution, a, history, when, it, was, mistakenly, thrown, into, the, fire, by, a, maid, he, wrote, it, again, from, the, beginning, writers, usually, develop, a, personal, schedule, angus, wilson, for, example, wrote, for, a, number, of, hours, every, morning, writer, s, block, is, a, relatively, common, experience, among, writers, especially, professional, writers, when, for, a, period, of, time, the, writer, feels, unable, to, write, for, reasons, other, than, lack, of, skill, or, commitment, happy, are, they, who, don, t, doubt, themselves, and, whose, pens, fly, across, the, page, gustave, flaubert, writing, to, louise, colet, most, writers, write, alone, typically, they, are, engaged, in, a, solitary, activity, that, requires, them, to, struggle, with, both, the, concepts, they, are, trying, to, express, and, the, best, way, to, express, it, this, may, mean, choosing, the, best, genre, or, genres, as, well, as, choosing, the, best, words, writers, often, develop, idiosyncratic, solutions, to, the, problem, of, finding, the, right, words, to, put, on, a, blank, page, or, screen, didn, t, somerset, maugham, also, write, facing, a, blank, wall, goethe, couldn, t, write, a, line, if, there, was, another, person, anywhere, in, the, same, house, or, so, he, said, at, some, point, collaborative, writing, means, that, other, authors, write, and, contribute, to, a, part, of, writing, in, this, approach, it, is, highly, likely, the, writers, will, collaborate, on, editing, the, part, too, the, more, usual, process, is, that, the, editing, is, done, by, an, independent, editor, after, the, writer, submits, a, draft, version, in, some, cases, such, as, that, between, a, librettist, and, composer, a, writer, will, collaborate, with, another, artist, on, a, creative, work, one, of, the, best, known, of, these, types, of, collaborations, is, that, between, gilbert, and, sullivan, librettist, w, s, gilbert, wrote, the, words, for, the, comic, operas, created, by, the, partnership, occasionally, a, writing, task, is, given, to, a, committee, of, writers, the, most, well, known, example, is, the, task, of, translating, the, bible, into, english, sponsored, by, king, james, vi, of, england, in, 1604, and, accomplished, by, six, committees, some, in, cambridge, and, some, in, oxford, who, were, allocated, different, sections, of, the, text, the, resulting, authorized, king, james, version, published, in, 1611, has, been, described, as, an, everlasting, miracle, because, its, writers, that, is, its, translators, sought, to, hold, themselves, consciously, poised, between, the, claims, of, accessibility, and, beauty, plainness, and, richness, simplicity, and, majesty, the, people, and, the, king, with, the, result, that, the, language, communicates, itself, in, a, way, which, is, quite, unaffected, neither, literary, nor, academic, not, historical, nor, reconstructionist, but, transmitting, a, nearly, incredible, immediacy, from, one, end, of, human, civilisation, to, another, some, writers, support, the, verbal, part, of, their, work, with, images, or, graphics, that, are, an, integral, part, of, the, way, their, ideas, are, communicated, william, blake, is, one, of, rare, poets, who, created, his, own, paintings, and, drawings, as, integral, parts, of, works, such, as, his, songs, of, innocence, and, of, experience, cartoonists, are, writers, whose, work, depends, heavily, on, hand, drawn, imagery, other, writers, especially, writers, for, children, incorporate, painting, or, drawing, in, more, or, less, sophisticated, ways, shaun, tan, for, example, is, a, writer, who, uses, imagery, extensively, sometimes, combining, fact, fiction, and, illustration, sometimes, for, a, didactic, purpose, sometimes, on, commission, children, s, writers, beatrix, potter, may, gibbs, and, theodor, seuss, geisel, are, as, well, known, for, their, illustrations, as, for, their, texts, some, writers, contribute, very, small, sections, to, a, part, of, writing, that, cumulates, as, a, result, this, method, is, particularly, suited, to, very, large, works, such, as, dictionaries, and, encyclopaedias, the, best, known, example, of, the, former, is, the, oxford, english, dictionary, under, the, editorship, of, lexicographer, james, murray, who, was, provided, with, the, prolific, and, helpful, contributions, of, w, c, minor, at, the, time, an, inmate, of, a, hospital, for, the, criminally, insane, the, best, known, example, of, the, latter, an, encyclopaedia, that, is, crowdsourced, is, wikipedia, which, relies, on, millions, of, writers, and, editors, such, as, simon, pulsifer, worldwide, writers, have, many, different, reasons, for, writing, among, which, is, usually, some, combination, of, self, expression, and, recording, facts, history, or, research, results, the, many, physician, writers, for, example, have, combined, their, observation, and, knowledge, of, the, human, condition, with, their, desire, to, write, and, contributed, many, poems, plays, translations, essays, and, other, texts, some, writers, write, extensively, on, their, motivation, and, on, the, likely, motivations, of, other, writers, for, example, george, orwell, s, essay, why, i, write, 1946, takes, this, as, its, subject, as, to, what, constitutes, success, or, failure, to, a, writer, it, has, been, described, as, a, complicated, business, where, the, material, rubs, up, against, the, spiritual, and, psychology, plays, a, big, part, the, moral, i, draw, is, that, the, writer, should, seek, his, reward, in, the, pleasure, of, his, work, and, in, release, from, the, burden, of, this, thoughts, and, indifferent, to, aught, else, care, nothing, for, praise, or, censure, failure, or, success, w, somerset, maugham, in, the, moon, and, sixpence, 1919, some, writers, are, the, authors, of, specific, military, orders, whose, clarity, will, determine, the, outcome, of, a, battle, among, the, most, controversial, and, unsuccessful, was, lord, raglan, s, order, at, the, charge, of, the, light, brigade, which, being, vague, and, misinterpreted, led, to, defeat, with, many, casualties, some, writers, use, the, writing, task, to, develop, their, own, skill, in, writing, itself, or, in, another, area, of, knowledge, or, explore, an, idea, while, they, are, producing, a, piece, of, writing, philologist, j, r, r, tolkien, for, example, created, a, new, language, for, his, fantasy, books, for, me, the, private, act, of, poetry, writing, is, songwriting, confessional, diary, keeping, speculation, problem, solving, storytelling, therapy, anger, management, craftsmanship, relaxation, concentration, and, spiritual, adventure, all, in, one, inexpensive, package, stephen, fry, author, poet, playwright, screenwriter, journalist, some, genres, are, a, particularly, appropriate, choice, for, writers, whose, chief, purpose, is, to, entertain, among, them, are, limericks, many, comics, and, thrillers, writers, of, children, s, literature, seek, to, entertain, children, but, are, also, usually, mindful, of, the, educative, function, of, their, work, as, well, i, think, that, i, shall, never, see, a, billboard, lovely, as, a, tree, indeed, unless, the, billboards, fall, i, ll, never, see, a, tree, at, all, ogden, nash, humorous, poet, reworking, a, poem, by, joyce, kilmer, for, comic, effect, anger, has, motivated, many, writers, including, martin, luther, angry, at, religious, corruption, who, wrote, the, ninety, five, theses, in, 1517, to, reform, the, church, and, mile, zola, 1840, 1902, who, wrote, the, public, letter, j, accuse, in, 1898, to, bring, public, attention, to, government, injustice, as, a, consequence, of, which, he, had, to, flee, to, england, from, his, native, france, such, writers, have,

when, they, are, commissioned, to, create, a, new, work, transcribe, an, original, one, translate, another, writer, s, work, or, write, for, someone, who, is, illiterate, or, inarticulate, in, some, cases, writing, has, been, the, only, way, an, individual, could, earn, an, income, frances, trollope, is, an, example, of, women, who, wrote, to, save, herself, and, her, family, from, penury, at, a,

do, this, include, to, separate, their, writing, from, other, work, or, other, types, of, writing, for, which, they, are, known, to, enhance, the, possibility, of, publication, by, reducing, prejudice, such, as, against, women, writers, or, writers, of, a, particular, race, to, reduce, personal, risk, such, as, political, risks, from, individuals, groups, or, states, that, disagree, with, them, or, to, make, their, name, better, suit, another, language, examples, of, well, known, writers, who, used, a, pen, name, include, george, eliot, 1819, 1880, whose, real, name, was, mary, anne,

these, writers, works, one, example, is, the, publication, of, books, like, japan, as, seen, and, described, by, famous, writers, a, 2010, reproduction, of, a, pre, 1923, publication, by, anonymous, another, example, is, the, founding, of, a, library, and, study, centre, for, the, study, of, early, english, women, s, writing, in, chawton, england, some, fictional, writers, are, very, well, known, because, of, the, strength, of, their, characterization, by, the, real, writer, or, the, significance, of, their, role, as, writer, in, the, plot, of, a, work, examples, of, this, type, of, fictional, writer, include, edward, casaubon, a, fictional, scholar, in, george, eliot, s, middlemarch, and, edwin, reardon, a, fictional, writer, in, george, gissing, s, new, grub, street, casaubon, s, efforts, to, complete, an, authoritative, study, affect, the, decisions, taken, by, the, protagonists, in, eliot, s, novel, and, inspire, significant, parts, of, the, plot, in, gissing, s, work, reardon, s,

purchased, from, the, cumaean, sibyl, by, the, last, king, of, rome, since, they, were, consulted, during, periods, of, crisis, it, could, be, said, that, they, are, a, case, of, real, works, created, by, a, fictional, writer, religious, texts, or, scriptures, are, the, texts, which, different, religious, traditions, consider, to, be, sacred, or, of, central, importance, to, their, religious, tradition, some, religions, and, spiritual, movements, believe, that, their, sacred, texts, are, divinely, or, supernaturally, revealed, or, inspired, while, others, have, individual, authors, skilled, writers, influence, ideas, and, society, so, there, are, many, instances, where, a, writer, s, work, or, opinion, has, been, unwelcome, and, controversial, in, some, cases, they, have, been, persecuted, or, punished, aware, that, their, writing, will, cause, controversy, or, put, themselves, and, others, into, danger, some, writers, self, censor, or, withhold, their, work, from, publication, or, hide, their, manuscripts, or, use, some, other, technique, to, preserve, and, protect, their, work, two, of, the, most, famous, examples, are, leonardo, da, vinci, and, charles, darwin, leonardo, had, the, habit, of, conversing, with, himself, in, his, writings, and, of, putting, his, thoughts, into, the, clearest, and, most, simple, form, he, used, left, handed, or, mirror, writing, a, technique, described, as, so, characteristic, of, him, to, protect, his, scientific, research, from, other, readers, the, fear, of, persecution, social, disgrace, and, being, proved, incorrect, are, regarded, as, contributing, factors, to, darwin, s, delaying, the, publication, of, his, radical, and, influential, work, on, the, origin, of, species, one, of, the, results, of, controversies, caused, by, a, writer, s, work, is, scandal, which, is, a, negative, public, reaction, that, causes, damage, to, reputation, and, depends, on, public, outrage, it, has, been, said, that, it, is, possible, to, scandalise, the, public, because, the, public, wants, to, be, shocked, in, order, to, confirm, its, own, sense, of, virtue, the, scandal, may, be, caused, by, what, the, writer, wrote, or, by, the, style, in, which, it, was, written, in, either, case, the, content, or, the, style, is, likely, to, have, broken, with, tradition, or, expectation, making, such, a, departure, may, in, fact, be, part, of, the, writer, s, intention, or, at, least, part, of, the, result, of, introducing, innovations, into, the, genre, in, which, they, are, working, for, example, novelist, d, h, lawrence, challenged, ideas, of, what, was, acceptable, as, well, as, what, was, expected, in, form, these, may, be, regarded, as, literary, scandals, just, as, in, a, different, way, are, the, scandals, involving, writers, who, mislead, the, public, about, their, identity, such, as, norma, khouri, or, helen, darville, who, in, deceiving, the, public, are, considered, to, have, committed, fraud, writers, may, also, cause, the, more, usual, type, of, scandal, whereby, the, public, is, outraged, by, the, opinions, behaviour, or, life, of, the, individual, an, experience, not, limited, to, writers, poet, paul, verlaine, outraged, society, with, his, behaviour, and, treatment, of, his, wife, and, child, as, well, as, his, lover, among, the, many, writers, whose, writing, or, life, was, affected, by, scandals, are, oscar, wilde, lord, byron, jean, paul, sartre, albert, camus, and, h, g, wells, one, of, the, most, famously, scandalous, writers, was, the, marquis, de, sade, who, offended, the, public, both, by, his, writings, and, by, his, behaviour, the, consequence, of, scandal, for, a, writer, may, be, censorship, or, discrediting, of, the, work, or, social, ostracism, of, its, creator, in, some, instances, punishment, persecution, or, prison, follow, the, list, of, journalists, killed, in, europe, list, of, journalists, killed, in, the, united, states,
