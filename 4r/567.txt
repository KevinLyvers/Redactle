augmentations, are, a, scientific, rather, than, an, artist, s, interpretation, for, much, of, its, existence, the, painting, was, coated, with, a, dark, varnish, which, gave, the, incorrect, impression, that, it, depicted, a, night, scene, leading, to, the, name, by, which, it, is, now, commonly, known, on, 13, january, 1911, a, jobless, shoemaker, and, former, navy, chef, attempted, to, slash, the, painting, with, a, shoemaker, s, knife, protesting, his, inability, to, find, work, however, the, thick, coating, of, varnish, protected, the, painting, from, any, damage, at, that, time, the, varnish, was, removed, only, in, the, 1940s, on, 14, september, 1975, the, work, was, attacked, with, a, bread, knife, by, an, unemployed, school, teacher, wilhelmus, de, rijk, resulting, in,

painting, was, successfully, restored, after, four, years, but, some, evidence, of, the, damage, is, still, visible, up, close, de, rijk, died, by, suicide, in, april, 1976, before, he, could, have, been, charged, on, 6, april, 1990, an, escaped, psychiatric, patient, sprayed, acid, onto, the, painting, with, a, concealed, pump, bottle, security, guards, intervened, stopping, the, man, and, quickly, spraying, water, onto, the, canvas, ultimately, the, acid, only, penetrated, the, varnish, layer, of, the, painting, and, it, was, fully, restored, in, july, 2019, a, long, and, complex, restoration, effort, began, the, restoration, took, place, in, public, in, a, specially, made, glass, enclosure, built, and, placed, in, the, rijksmuseum, and, was, livestreamed, the, plan, was, to,
