les, mis, rables, knocks, at, the, door, and, says, open, up, i, am, here, for, you, more, than, a, quarter, of, the, novel, by, one, count, 955, of, 2, 783, pages, is, devoted, to, essays, that, argue, a, moral, point, or, display, hugo, s, encyclopedic, knowledge, but, do, not, advance, the, plot, nor, even, a, subplot, a, method, hugo, used, in, such, other, works, as, the, hunchback, of, notre, dame, and, toilers, of, the, sea, one, biographer, noted, the, digressions, of, genius, are, easily, pardoned, the, topics, hugo, addresses, include, cloistered, religious, orders, the, construction, of, the, paris, sewers, argot, and, the, street, urchins, of, paris, the, one, about, convents, he, titles, parenthesis, to, alert, the, reader, to, its, irrelevance, to, the, storyline, hugo, devotes, another, 19, chapters, volume, ii, book, i, to, an, account, and, meditation, on, the, place, in, history, of, the, battle, of, waterloo, the, battlefield, of, which, hugo, visited, in, 1861, and, where, he, finished, writing, the, novel, it, opens, volume, 2, with, such, a, change, of, subject, as, to, seem, the, beginning, of, an, entirely, different, work, the, fact, that, this, digression, occupies, such, a, large, part, of, the, text, demands, that, it, be, read, in, the, context, of, the, overarching, structure, discussed, above, hugo, draws, his, own, personal, conclusions, taking, waterloo, to, be, a, pivot, point, in, history, but, definitely, not, a, victory, for, the, forces, of, reaction, waterloo, by, cutting, short, the, demolition, of, european, thrones, by, the, sword, had, no, other, effect, than, to, cause, the, revolutionary, work, to, be, continued, in, another, direction, the, slashers, have, finished, it, was, the, turn, of, the, thinkers, the, century, that, waterloo, was, intended, to, arrest, has, pursued, its, march, that, sinister, victory, was, vanquished, by, liberty, one, critic, has, called, this, the, spiritual, gateway, to, the, novel, as, its, chance, encounter, of, th, nardier, and, colonel, pontmercy, foreshadows, so, many, of, the, novel, s, encounters, blending, chance, and, necessity, a, confrontation, of, heroism, and, villainy, even, when, not, turning, to, other, subjects, outside, his, narrative, hugo, sometimes, interrupts, the, straightforward, recitation, of, events, his, voice, and, control, of, the, storyline, unconstrained, by, time, and, sequence, the, novel, opens, with, a, statement, about, the, bishop, of, digne, in, 1815, and, immediately, shifts, although, these, details, in, no, way, essentially, concern, that, which, we, have, to, tell, only, after, 14, chapters, does, hugo, pick, up, the, opening, thread, again, in, the, early, days, of, the, month, of, october, 1815, to, introduce, jean, valjean, an, incident, hugo, witnessed, in, 1829, involved, three, strangers, and, a, police, officer, one, of, the, strangers, was, a, man, who, had, stolen, a, loaf, of, bread, similar, to, jean, valjean, the, officer, was, taking, him, to, the, coach, the, thief, also, saw, the, mother, and, daughter, playing, with, each, other, which, would, be, an, inspiration, for, fantine, and, cosette, hugo, imagined, the, life, of, the, man, in, jail, and, the, mother, and, daughter, taken, away, from, each, other, valjean, s, character, is, loosely, based, on, the, life, of, the, ex, convict, eug, ne, fran, ois, vidocq, vidocq, became, the, head, of, an, undercover, police, unit, and, later, founded, france, s, first, private, detective, agency, he, was, also, a, businessman, and, was, widely, noted, for, his, social, engagement, and, philanthropy, vidocq, also, inspired, hugo, s, claude, gueux, and, le, dernier, jour, d, un, condamn, the, last, day, of, a, condemned, man, in, 1828, vidocq, already, pardoned, saved, one, of, the, workers, in, his, paper, factory, by, lifting, a, heavy, cart, on, his, shoulders, as, valjean, does, hugo, s, description, of, valjean, rescuing, a, sailor, on, the, orion, draws, almost, word, for, word, on, a, baron, la, ronci, re, s, letter, describing, such, an, incident, hugo, used, bienvenu, de, miollis, 1753, 1843, the, bishop, of, digne, during, the, time, in, which, valjean, encounters, myriel, as, the, model, for, myriel, hugo, had, used, the, departure, of, prisoners, from, the, bagne, of, toulon, in, one, of, his, early, stories, le, dernier, jour, d, un, condamn, he, went, to, toulon, to, visit, the, bagne, in, 1839, and, took, extensive, notes, though, he, did, not, start, writing, the, book, until, 1845, on, one, of, the, pages, of, his, notes, about, the, prison, he, wrote, in, large, block, letters, a, possible, name, for, his, hero, jean, tr, jean, when, the, book, was, finally, written, tr, jean, became, valjean, in, 1841, hugo, saved, a, prostitute, from, arrest, for, assault, he, used, a, short, part, of, his, dialogue, with, the, police, when, recounting, valjean, s, rescue, of, fantine, in, the, novel, on, 22, february, 1846, when, he, had, begun, work, on, the, novel, hugo, witnessed, the, arrest, of, a, bread, thief, while, a, duchess, and, her, child, watched, the, scene,

revolt, and, its, monarchist, allies, 273, 276, victor, hugo, drew, his, inspiration, from, everything, he, heard, and, saw, writing, it, down, in, his, diary, in, december, 1846, he, witnessed, an, altercation, between, an, old, woman, scavenging, through, rubbish, and, a, street, urchin, who, might, have, been, gavroche, he, also, informed, himself, by, personal, inspection, of, the, paris, conciergerie, in, 1846, and, waterloo, in, 1861, by, gathering, information, on, some, industries, and, on, working, class, people, s, wages, and, living, standards, he, asked, his, mistresses, l, onie, d, aunet, and, juliette, drouet, to, tell, him, about, life, in, convents, he, also, slipped, personal, anecdotes, into, the, plot, for, instance, marius, and, cosette, s, wedding, night, part,

up, to, the, time, and, features, the, interventions, of, detectives, and, the, indifference, of, aristocrats, although, socially, progressive, in, tone, it, is, more, sensationalist, than, les, mis, rables, and, does, not, have, the, same, breadth, of, moral, vision, in, 1815, digne, the, peasant, jean, valjean, just, released, from, 19, years, imprisonment, in, the, bagne, of, toulon, five, for,

and, disappointing, flaubert, found, neither, truth, nor, greatness, in, it, he, complained, that, the, characters, were, crude, stereotypes, who, all, speak, very, well, but, all, in, the, same, way, he, deemed, it, an, infantile, effort, and, brought, an, end, to, hugo, s, career, like, the, fall, of, a, god, in, a, newspaper, review, charles, baudelaire, praised, hugo, s, success, in, focusing, public, attention, on, social, problems, though, he, believed, that, such, propaganda, was, the, opposite, of, art, in, private, he, castigated, it, as, repulsive, and, inept, immonde, et, inepte,
