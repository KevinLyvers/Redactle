fitzgerald, completed, a, rough, draft, of, the, novel, in, 1924, he, submitted, it, to, editor, maxwell, perkins, who, persuaded, fitzgerald, to, revise, the, work, over, the, following, winter, after, making, revisions, fitzgerald, was, satisfied, with, the, text, but, remained, ambivalent, about, the, book, s, title, and, considered, several, alternatives, painter, francis, cugat, s, dust, jacket, art, named, celestial, eyes, greatly, impressed, fitzgerald, and, he, incorporated, its, imagery, into, the, novel, after, its, publication, by, scribner, s, in, april, 1925, the, great, gatsby, received, generally, favorable, reviews, though, some, literary, critics, believed, it, did, not, equal, fitzgerald, s, previous, efforts, compared, to, his, earlier, novels, this, side, of, paradise, 1920, and, the, beautiful, and, damned, 1922, the, novel, was, a, commercial, disappointment, it, sold, fewer, than, 20, 000, copies, by, october, and, fitzgerald, s, hopes, of, a, monetary, windfall, from, the, novel, were, unrealized, when, the, author, died, in, 1940, he, believed, himself, to, be, a, failure, and, his, work, forgotten, during, world, war, ii, the, novel, experienced, an, abrupt, surge, in, popularity, when, the, council, on, books, in, wartime, distributed, free, copies, to, american, soldiers, serving, overseas, this, new, found, popularity, launched, a, critical, and, scholarly, re, examination, and, the, work, soon, became, a, core, part, of, most, american, high, school, curricula, and, a, part, of, american, popular, culture, numerous, stage, and, film, adaptations, followed, in, the, subsequent, decades, gatsby, continues, to, attract, popular, and, scholarly, attention, scholars, emphasize, the, novel, s, treatment, of, social, class, inherited, versus, self, made, wealth, gender, race, and, environmentalism, and, its, cynical, attitude, towards, the, american, dream, the, great, gatsby, is, widely, considered, to, be, a, literary, masterpiece, and, a, contender, for, the, title, of, the, great, american, novel, set, on, the, prosperous, long, island, of, 1922, the, great, gatsby, provides, a, critical, social, history, of, prohibition, era, america, during, the, jazz, age, f, scott, fitzgerald, s, fictional, narrative, fully, renders, that, period, known, for, its, jazz, music, economic, prosperity, flapper, culture, libertine, mores, rebellious, youth, and, ubiquitous, speakeasies, fitzgerald, uses, many, of, these, 1920s, societal, developments, to, tell, his, story, from, simple, details, like, petting, in, automobiles, to, broader, themes, such, as, bootlegging, as, the, illicit, source, of, gatsby, s, fortune, fitzgerald, conveys, the, hedonism, of, jazz, age, society, by, placing, a, relatable, plotline, within, the, historical, context, of, the, most, raucous, and, flashiest, era, in, american, history, in, fitzgerald, s, eyes, the, era, represented, a, morally, permissive, time, when, americans, of, all, ages, became, disillusioned, with, prevailing, social, norms, and, obsessed, with, pleasure, seeking, fitzgerald, himself, had, a, certain, ambivalence, towards, the, jazz, age, an, era, whose, themes, he, would, later, regard, as, reflective, of, events, in, his, own, life, the, great, gatsby, reflects, various, events, in, fitzgerald, s, youth, he, was, a, young, midwesterner, from, minnesota, like, the, novel, s, narrator, who, went, to, yale, he, was, educated, at, an, ivy, league, school, princeton, there, the, 18, year, old, fitzgerald, met, ginevra, king, a, 16, year, old, socialite, with, whom, he, fell, deeply, in, love, although, ginevra, was, madly, in, love, with, him, her, upper, class, family, openly, discouraged, his, courtship, of, their, daughter, because, of, his, lower, class, status, and, her, father, purportedly, told, him, that, poor, boys, shouldn, t, think, of, marrying, rich, girls, rejected, by, ginevra, s, family, as, a, suitor, because, of, his, lack, of, financial, prospects, a, suicidal, fitzgerald, enlisted, in, the, united, states, army, amid, world, war, i, and, was, commissioned, as, a, second, lieutenant, while, awaiting, deployment, to, the, western, front, where, he, hoped, to, die, in, combat, he, was, stationed, at, camp, sheridan, in, montgomery, alabama, where, he, met, zelda, sayre, a, vivacious, 17, year, old, southern, belle, after, learning, that, ginevra, had, married, wealthy, chicago, businessman, william, bill, mitchell, fitzgerald, asked, zelda, to, marry, him, zelda, agreed, but, postponed, their, marriage, until, he, became, financially, successful, fitzgerald, is, thus, similar, to, jay, gatsby, in, that, he, became, engaged, while, a, military, officer, stationed, far, from, home, and, then, sought, immense, wealth, in, order, to, provide, for, the, lifestyle, to, which, his, fianc, e, had, become, accustomed, after, his, success, as, a, short, story, writer, and, as, a, novelist, fitzgerald, married, zelda, in, new, york, city, and, the, newly, wed, couple, soon, relocated, to, long, island, despite, enjoying, the, exclusive, long, island, milieu, fitzgerald, quietly, disapproved, of, the, extravagant, parties, and, the, wealthy, persons, he, encountered, often, disappointed, him, while, striving, to, emulate, the, rich, he, found, their, privileged, lifestyle, to, be, morally, disquieting, although, fitzgerald, like, gatsby, had, always, admired, the, rich, he, nonetheless, possessed, a, smoldering, resentment, towards, them, in, spring, 1922, nick, carraway, a, yale, alumnus, from, the, midwest, and, a, world, war, i, veteran, journeys, to, new, york, city, to, obtain, employment, as, a, bond, salesman, he, rents, a,

telephones, him, at, his, home, and, who, lives, in, the, valley, of, ashes, a, sprawling, refuse, dump, that, evening, nick, sees, gatsby, standing, alone, on, his, lawn, staring, at, a, green,

introduces, himself, as, jay, gatsby, and, insists, that, both, he, and, nick, served, in, the, 3rd, infantry, division, during, the, war, gatsby, attempts, to, ingratiate, himself, with, nick, and, when, nick, leaves, the, party, he, notices, gatsby, watching, him, in, late, july, nick, and, gatsby, have, lunch, at, a, speakeasy, gatsby, tries, impressing, nick, with, tales, of, his, war, heroism, and, his, oxford, days, afterward, nick, meets, jordan, again, at, the, plaza, hotel, jordan, reveals, that, gatsby, and, daisy, met, around, 1917, when, gatsby, was, an, officer, in, the, american, expeditionary, forces, they, fell, in, love, but, when, gatsby, was, deployed, overseas, daisy, reluctantly, married, tom, gatsby, hopes, that, his, newfound, wealth, and, dazzling, parties, will, make, daisy, reconsider, gatsby, uses, nick, to, stage, a, reunion, with, daisy, and, the, two, embark, upon, an, affair, in, september, tom, discovers, the, affair, when, daisy, carelessly, addresses, gatsby, with, unabashed, intimacy, in, front, of, him, later, at, a, plaza, hotel, suite, gatsby, and, tom, argue, about, the, affair, gatsby, insists, daisy, declare, that, she, never,

garage, and, their, car, strikes, myrtle, killing, her, instantly, later, gatsby, reveals, to, nick, that, daisy, was, driving, the, car, but, that, he, intends, to, take, the, blame, for, the, accident, to, protect, her, nick, urges, gatsby, to, flee, to, avoid, prosecution, but, he, refuses, after, tom, tells, george, that, gatsby, owns, the, car, that, struck, myrtle, a, distraught, george, assumes, the, owner, of, the, vehicle, must, be, myrtle, s, lover, george, fatally, shoots, gatsby, in, his, mansion, s, swimming, pool, then, kills, himself, several, days, after, gatsby, s, murder, his, father, henry, gatz, arrives, for, the, sparsely, attended, funeral, after, gatsby, s, death, nick, comes, to, hate, new, york, and, decides, that, gatsby, daisy, tom, and, he, were, all, midwesterners, unsuited, to, eastern, life, nick, encounters, tom, and, initially, refuses, to, shake, his, hand, tom, admits, he, was, the, one, who, told, george, that, gatsby, owned, the, vehicle, that, killed, myrtle, before, returning, to, the, midwest, nick, returns, to, gatsby, s, mansion, and, stares, across, the, bay, at, the, green, light, emanating, from, the, end, of, daisy, s, dock, fitzgerald, began, outlining, his, third, novel, in, june, 1922, he, longed, to, produce, an, exquisite, work, that, was, beautiful, and, intricately, patterned, but, the, troubled, production, of, his, stage, play, the, vegetable, repeatedly, interrupted, his, progress, the, play, flopped, and, fitzgerald, wrote, magazine, stories, that, winter, to, pay, debts, incurred, by, its, production, he, viewed, these, stories, as, all, worthless, although, included, among, them, was, winter, dreams, which, fitzgerald, described, as, his, first, attempt, at, the, gatsby, idea, the, whole, idea, of, gatsby, he, later, explained, to, a, friend, is, the, unfairness, of, a, poor, young, man, not, being, able, to, marry, a, girl, with, money, this, theme, comes, up, again, and, again, because, i, lived, it, in, october, 1922, after, the, birth, of, their, only, child, frances, scott, scottie, fitzgerald, the, fitzgeralds, moved, to, great, neck, new, york, on, long, island, their, neighbors, in, great, neck, included, such, newly, wealthy, personages, as, writer, ring, lardner, actor, lew, fields, and, comedian, ed, wynn, these, figures, were, all, considered, to, be, nouveau, riche, unlike, those, who, came, from, manhasset, neck, which, sat, across, the, bay, from, great, neck, places, that, were, home, to, many, of, new, york, s, wealthiest, established, families, this, real, life, juxtaposition, gave, fitzgerald, his, idea, for, west, egg, and, east, egg, in, the, novel, great, neck, kings, point, became, the, new, money, peninsula, of, west, egg, and, port, washington, sands, point, became, the, old, money, east, egg, several, gold, coast, mansions, in, the, area, served, as, inspiration, for, gatsby, s, estate, including, land, s, end, oheka, castle, and, the, since, demolished, beacon, towers, while, living, on, long, island, the, fitzgeralds, enigmatic, neighbor, was, max, gerlach, purportedly, born, in, america, to, a, german, immigrant, family, gerlach, had, been, a, major, in, the, american, expeditionary, forces, during, world, war, i, and, he, later, became, a, gentleman, bootlegger, who, lived, like, a, millionaire, in, new, york, flaunting, his, new, wealth, gerlach, threw, lavish, parties, never, wore, the, same, shirt, twice, used, the, phrase, old, sport, and, fostered, myths, about, himself, including, that, he, was, a, relation, of, the, german, kaiser, these, details, about, gerlach, inspired, fitzgerald, in, his, creation, of, jay, gatsby, during, this, same, time, period, the, daily, newspapers, sensationalized, the, hall, mills, murder, case, over, many, months, and, the, highly, publicized, case, likely, influenced, the, plot, of, fitzgerald, s, novel, the, case, involved, the, double, murder, of, a, man, and, his, lover, on, september, 14, 1922, mere, weeks, before, fitzgerald, arrived, in, great, neck, scholars, have, speculated, that, fitzgerald, based, certain, aspects, of, the, ending, of, the, great, gatsby, and, various, characterizations, on, this, factual, incident, inspired, by, the, halls, mills, case, the, mysterious, persona, of, gerlach, and, the, riotous, parties, he, attended, on, long, island, fitzgerald, had, written, 18, 000, words, for, his, novel, by, mid, 1923, but, discarded, most, of, his, new, story, as, a, false, start, some, of, this, early, draft, resurfaced, in, the, 1924, short, story, absolution, in, earlier, drafts, daisy, was, originally, named, ada, and, nick, was, dud, and, the, two, characters, had, shared, a, previous, romance, prior, to, their, reunion, on, long, island, these, earlier, drafts, were, written, from, the, viewpoint, of, an, omniscient, narrator, as, opposed, to, nick, s, perspective, a, key, difference, in, earlier, drafts, is, a, less, complete, failure, of, gatsby, s, dream, another, difference, is, that, the, argument, between, tom, buchanan, and, gatsby, is, more, balanced, although, daisy, still, returns, to, tom, work, on, the, great, gatsby, resumed, in, earnest, in, april, 1924, fitzgerald, decided, to, depart, from, the, writing, process, of, his, previous, novels, and, told, perkins, that, he, was, intent, on, creating, an, artistic, achievement, he, wished, to, eschew, the, realism, of, his, previous, two, novels, and, to, compose, a, creative, work, of, sustained, imagination, to, this, end, he, consciously, imitated, the, literary, styles, of, joseph, conrad, and, willa, cather, he, was, particularly, influenced, by, cather, s, 1923, work, a, lost, lady, which, features, a, wealthy, married, socialite, pursued, by, a, variety, of, romantic, suitors, and, who, symbolically, embodies, the, american, dream, he, later, wrote, a, letter, to, cather, apologizing, for, any, unintentional, plagiarism, during, this, period, of, revisions, scott, saw, and, was, influenced, by, early, sketches, for, the, book, s, dust, jacket, art, soon, after, this, burst, of, effort, work, slowed, while, the, fitzgeralds, moved, to, the, villa, marie, in, saint, rapha, l, on, the, french, riviera, where, a, marital, crisis, soon, developed, despite, his, ongoing, marital, tension, fitzgerald, continued, to, write, steadily, and, submitted, a, near, final, version, of, the, manuscript, to, his, editor, maxwell, perkins, on, october, 27, perkins, informed, him, in, a, november, letter, that, gatsby, was, too, vague, as, a, character, and, that, his, wealth, and, business, respectively, needed, a, convincing, explanation, fitzgerald, thanked, perkins, for, his, detailed, criticisms, and, claimed, that, such, feedback, would, enable, him, to, perfect, the, manuscript, having, relocated, with, his, wife, to, rome, fitzgerald, made, revisions, to, the, manuscript, throughout, the, winter, content, after, a, few, rounds, of, revision, fitzgerald, submitted, the, final, version, in, february, 1925, fitzgerald, s, alterations, included, extensive, revisions, of, the, sixth, and, eighth, chapters, he, declined, an, offer, of, 10, 000, for, the, serial, rights, to, the, book, so, that, it, could, be, published, sooner, he, received, a, 3, 939, advance, in, 1923, and, would, receive, 1, 981, 25, upon, publication, fitzgerald, had, difficulty, choosing, a, title, for, his, novel, and, entertained, many, choices, before, reluctantly, deciding, on, the, great, gatsby, a, title, inspired, by, alain, fournier, s, le, grand, meaulnes, previously, he, had, shifted, between, among, ash, heaps, and, millionaires, trimalchio, trimalchio, in, west, egg, on, the, road, to, west, egg, under, the, red, white, and, blue, the, gold, hatted, gatsby, and, the, high, bouncing, lover, the, titles, the, gold, hatted, gatsby, and, the, high, bouncing, lover, came, from, fitzgerald, s, epigraph, for, the, novel, one, which, he, wrote, himself, under, the, pen, name, of, thomas, parke, d, invilliers, fitzgerald, initially, preferred, titles, referencing, trimalchio, the, crude, upstart, in, petronius, s, satyricon, and, even, refers, to, gatsby, as, trimalchio, once, in, the, novel, unlike, gatsby, s, spectacular, parties, trimalchio, participated, in, the, orgies, he, hosted, but, according, to, literary, critic, tony, tanner, there, are, subtle, similarities, between, the, two, characters, by, november, 1924, fitzgerald, wrote, to, perkins, that, he, had, settled, upon, the, title, of, trimalchio, in, west, egg, disliking, fitzgerald, s, chosen, title, of, trimalchio, in, west, egg, editor, max, perkins, persuaded, him, that, the, reference, was, too, obscure, and, that, people, would, be, unable, to, pronounce, it, zelda, and, perkins, both, expressed, their, preference, for, the, great, gatsby, and, the, next, month, fitzgerald, agreed, a, month, before, publication, after, a, final, review, of, the, proofs, he, asked, if, it, would, be, possible, to, re, title, it, trimalchio, or, gold, hatted, gatsby, but, perkins, advised, against, it, on, march, 19, 1925, fitzgerald, expressed, enthusiasm, for, the, title, under, the, red, white, and, blue, but, it, was, too, late, to, change, it, at, that, stage, the, novel, was, published, as, the, great, gatsby, on, april, 10, 1925, fitzgerald, believed, the, book, s, final, title, to, be, merely, acceptable, and, often, expressed, his, ambivalence, with, the, name, the, artwork, for, the, first, edition, of, the, great, gatsby, known, as, celestial, eyes, is, among, the, most, celebrated, in, american, literature, and, represents, a, unique, instance, in, literary, history, in, which, a, novel, s, commissioned, artwork, directly, influenced, the, composition, of, the, text, rendered, in, an, art, deco, visual, style, the, artwork, depicts, the, disembodied, face, of, a, jazz, age, flapper, with, celestial, eyes, and, rouged, mouth, over, a, dark, blue, skyline, a, little, known, barcelonan, painter, named, francis, cugat, born, francisco, coradal, cougat, was, commissioned, by, an, unknown, individual, in, scribner, s, art, department, to, illustrate, the, cover, while, fitzgerald, was, composing, the, novel, in, a, preliminary, sketch, cugat, drew, a, concept, of, a, dismal, gray, landscape, inspired, by, fitzgerald, s, original, title, for, the, novel, among, ash, heaps, and, millionaires, discarding, this, gloomy, concept, cugat, next, drew, a, divergent, study, which, became, the, prefiguration, to, the, final, cover, a, pencil, and, crayon, drawing, of, a, flapper, s, half, hidden, visage, over, long, island, sound, with, scarlet, lips, one, celestial, eye, and, a, single, diagonal, tear, expanding, upon, this, study, his, subsequent, drawing, featured, two, bright, eyes, looming, over, a, shadowy, new, york, cityscape, in, later, iterations, cugat, replaced, the, shadowy, cityscape, with, dazzling, carnival, lights, evoking, a, ferris, wheel, and, likely, referencing, the, glittering, amusement, park, at, new, york, s, coney, island, cugat, affixed, reclining, nudes, within, the, flapper, s, irizes, and, added, a, green, tint, to, the, streaming, tear, cugat, s, final, cover, which, max, perkins, hailed, as, a, masterpiece, was, the, only, work, he, completed, for, scribner, s, and, the, only, book, cover, he, ever, designed, although, fitzgerald, likely, never, saw, the, final, gouache, painting, prior, to, the, novel, s, publication, cugat, s, preparatory, drafts, influenced, his, writing, upon, viewing, cugat, s, drafts, before, sailing, for, france, in, april, may, 1924, fitzgerald, was, so, enamored, that, he, later, told, editor, max, perkins, that, he, had, incorporated, cugat, s, imagery, into, the, novel, this, statement, has, led, many, to, analyze, interrelations, between, cugat, s, art, and, fitzgerald, s, text, one, popular, interpretation, is, that, the, celestial, eyes, are, reminiscent, of, those, of, optometrist, t, j, eckleburg, depicted, on, a, faded, commercial, billboard, near, george, wilson, s, auto, repair, shop, author, ernest, hemingway, supported, this, latter, interpretation, and, claimed, that, fitzgerald, had, told, him, the, cover, referred, to, a, billboard, in, the, valley, of, the, ashes, although, this, passage, has, some, resemblance, to, the, imagery, a, closer, explanation, can, be, found, in, fitzgerald, s, explicit, description, of, daisy, buchanan, as, the, girl, whose, disembodied, face, floated, along, the, dark, cornices, and, blinding, signs, charles, scribner, s, sons, published, the, great, gatsby, on, april, 10, 1925, fitzgerald, cabled, perkins, the, day, after, publication, to, monitor, reviews, any, news, sales, situation, doubtful, excellent, reviews, read, a, telegram, from, perkins, on, april, 20, fitzgerald, responded, on, april, 24, saying, the, cable, dispirited, him, closing, the, letter, with, yours, in, great, depression, fitzgerald, soon, received, letters, from, contemporaries, willa, cather, edith, wharton, and, poet, t, s, eliot, praising, the, novel, although, gratified, by, such, correspondence, fitzgerald, sought, public, acclaim, from, professional, critics, the, great, gatsby, received, generally, favorable, reviews, from, literary, critics, of, the, day, edwin, clark, of, the, new, york, times, felt, the, novel, was, a, mystical, and, glamorous, tale, of, the, jazz, age, similarly, lillian, c, ford, of, the, los, angeles, times, hailed, the, novel, as, a, revelatory, work, of, art, that, leaves, the, reader, in, a, mood, of, chastened, wonder, the, new, york, post, described, fitzgerald, s, prose, style, as, scintillating, and, genuinely, brilliant, the, new, york, herald, tribune, was, less, impressed, referring, to, the, great, gatsby, as, a, literary, lemon, meringue, that, nonetheless, contains, some, of, the, nicest, little, touches, of, contemporary, observation, you, could, imagine, so, light, so, delicate, so, sharp, in, the, chicago, daily, tribune, h, l, mencken, judged, the, work, s, plot, to, be, highly, improbable, although, he, praised, the, writing, as, elegant, and, the, careful, and, brilliant, finish, several, reviewers, felt, the, novel, left, much, to, be, desired, following, fitzgerald, s, previous, works, and, criticized, him, accordingly, harvey, eagleton, of, the, dallas, morning, news, predicted, that, the, novel, signaled, the, end, of, fitzgerald, s, artistic, success, ralph, coghlan, of, the, st, louis, post, dispatch, dismissed, the, work, as, an, inconsequential, performance, by, a, once, promising, author, who, had, grown, bored, and, cynical, ruth, snyder, of, new, york, evening, world, lambasted, the, book, s, style, as, painfully, forced, and, declared, the, editors, of, her, newspaper, were, quite, convinced, after, reading, the, great, gatsby, that, mr, fitzgerald, is, not, one, of, the, great, american, writers, of, today, john, mcclure, of, the, times, picayune, insisted, the, plot, was, implausible, and, the, book, itself, seemed, raw, in, its, construction, after, reading, these, reviews, fitzgerald, believed, that, many, critics, misunderstood, the, novel, he, despaired, that, of, all, the, reviews, even, the, most, enthusiastic, not, one, had, the, slightest, idea, what, the, book, was, about, in, particular, fitzgerald, resented, criticisms, of, the, novel, s, plot, as, implausible, since, he, had, never, intended, for, the, story, to, be, realistic, instead, he, crafted, the, work, to, be, a, romanticized, depiction, that, was, largely, scenic, and, symbolic, according, to, his, friend, john, peale, bishop, fitzgerald, further, resented, the, fact, that, critics, failed, to, perceive, the, many, parallels, between, the, author, s, life, and, the, character, of, jay, gatsby, in, particular, that, both, created, a, mythical, version, of, themselves, and, attempted, to, live, up, to, this, legend, dispirited, by, critics, failing, to, understand, the, novel, fitzgerald, remained, hopeful, that, the, novel, would, at, least, be, a, commercial, success, perhaps, selling, as, many, as, 75, 000, copies, to, fitzgerald, s, great, disappointment, gatsby, was, a, commercial, failure, in, comparison, with, his, previous, efforts, this, side, of, paradise, 1920, and, the, beautiful, and, damned, 1922, by, october, the, book, had, sold, fewer, than, 20, 000, copies, although, the, novel, went, through, two, initial, printings, many, copies, remained, unsold, years, later, fitzgerald, attributed, the, poor, sales, to, the, fact, that, women, tended, to, be, the, primary, audience, for, novels, during, this, time, and, gatsby, did, not, contain, an, admirable, female, character, according, to, his, ledger, he, earned, only, 2, 000, from, the, book, although, owen, davis, 1926, stage, adaptation, and, the, paramount, issued, silent, film, version, brought, in, money, for, the, author, fitzgerald, lamented, that, the, novel, fell, far, short, of, the, success, he, had, hoped, for, and, would, not, bring, him, recognition, as, a, serious, novelist, in, the, public, eye, with, the, onset, of, the, great, depression, the, great, gatsby, was, regarded, as, little, more, than, a, nostalgic, period, piece, by, the, time, fitzgerald, died, in, 1940, the, novel, had, fallen, into, near, obscurity, in, 1940, fitzgerald, suffered, a, third, and, fatal, heart, attack, and, died, believing, his, work, forgotten, his, obituary, in, the, new, york, times, hailed, him, as, a, brilliant, novelist, and, cited, gatsby, as, his, greatest, work, in, the, wake, of, fitzgerald, s, death, a, strong, appreciation, for, the, book, gradually, developed, in, writers, circles, future, authors, budd, schulberg, and, edward, newhouse, were, deeply, affected, by, it, and, john, o, hara, acknowledged, its, influence, on, his, work, by, the, time, that, gatsby, was, republished, in, edmund, wilson, s, edition, of, the, last, tycoon, in, 1941, the, prevailing, opinion, in, writers, circles, deemed, the, novel, to, be, an, enduring, work, of, fiction, in, the, spring, of, 1942, mere, months, after, the, united, states, entrance, into, world, war, ii, an, association, of, publishing, executives, created, the, council, on, books, in, wartime, with, the, stated, purpose, of, distributing, paperback, armed, services, editions, books, to, combat, troops, the, great, gatsby, was, one, of, them, within, the, next, several, years, 155, 000, copies, of, gatsby, were, distributed, to, u, s, soldiers, overseas, and, the, book, proved, popular, among, beleaguered, troops, according, to, the, saturday, evening, post, s, 1945, report, by, 1944, a, full, scale, fitzgerald, revival, had, occurred, full, length, scholarly, articles, on, fitzgerald, s, works, were, being, published, in, periodicals, and, by, the, following, year, the, earlier, consensus, among, professional, critics, that, the, great, gatsby, was, merely, a, sensational, story, or, a, nostalgic, period, piece, had, effectively, vanished, the, tireless, promotional, efforts, of, literary, critic, edmund, wilson, who, was, fitzgerald, s, princeton, classmate, and, his, close, friend, led, this, fitzgerald, revival, in, 1951, three, years, after, zelda, s, death, in, a, hospital, fire, professor, arthur, mizener, of, cornell, university, published, the, far, side, of, paradise, the, first, biography, of, fitzgerald, mizener, s, bestselling, biography, emphasized, the, great, gatsby, s, positive, reception, by, literary, critics, which, may, have, further, influenced, public, opinion, and, renewed, interest, in, it, by, 1960, thirty, five, years, after, the, novel, s, original, publication, the, book, was, steadily, selling, 100, 000, copies, per, year, renewed, interest, in, it, led, the, new, york, times, editorialist, mizener, to, proclaim, the, novel, was, a, masterwork, of, 20th, century, american, literature, by, 1974, the, great, gatsby, had, attained, its, status, as, a, literary, masterwork, and, was, deemed, a, contender, for, the, title, of, the, great, american, novel, hunter, s, thompson, retyped, pages, of, the, great, gatsby, just, to, get, a, feeling, of, what, it, was, like, to, write, that, way, according, to, thompson, s, friend, william, nack, thompson, once, retyped, the, entirety, of, the, novel, roger, ebert, wrote, that, perhaps, fitzgerald, s, words, compelled, into, an, aesthetic, contemplation, he, neither, understood, nor, desired, is, the, best, possible, description, of, thompson, s, life, s, work, by, the, mid, 2000s, many, literary, critics, considered, the, great, gatsby, to, be, one, of, the, greatest, novels, ever, written, and, the, work, was, part, of, the, assigned, curricula, in, the, near, majority, of, u, s, high, schools, as, of, early, 2020, the, great, gatsby, had, sold, almost, 30, million, copies, worldwide, and, continues, to, sell, an, additional, 500, 000, copies, annually, numerous, foreign, editions, of, the, novel, have, been, published, and, the, text, has, been, translated, into, 42, different, languages, the, work, is, scribner, s, most, popular, title, in, 2013, the, e, book, alone, sold, 185, 000, copies, the, novel, s, u, s, copyright, expired, on, january, 1, 2021, when, all, works, published, in, 1925, entered, the, public, domain, since, then, numerous, altered, and, incomplete, reprints, have, flooded, the, market, following, the, novel, s, revival, later, critical, writings, on, the, great, gatsby, focused, on, fitzgerald, s, disillusionment, with, the, american, dream, in, the, hedonistic, jazz, age, a, name, for, the, era, which, fitzgerald, claimed, to, have, coined, in, 1970, scholar, roger, l, pearson, asserted, that, fitzgerald, s, work, more, so, than, other, twentieth, century, novels, is, especially, linked, with, this, conceptualization, of, the, american, dream, pearson, traced, the, literary, origins, of, this, dream, to, colonial, america, the, dream, is, the, belief, that, every, individual, regardless, of, their, origins, may, seek, and, achieve, their, desired, goals, be, they, political, monetary, or, social, it, is, the, literary, expression, of, the, concept, of, america, the, land, of, opportunity, however, pearson, noted, that, fitzgerald, s, particular, treatment, of, this, theme, is, devoid, of, the, discernible, optimism, in, the, writings, of, earlier, american, authors, he, suggests, gatsby, serves, as, a, false, prophet, of, the, american, dream, and, pursuing, the, dream, only, results, in, dissatisfaction, for, those, who, chase, it, owing, to, its, unattainability, in, this, analytical, context, the, green, light, on, the, buchanans, dock, visible, across, long, island, sound, from, gatsby, s, house, is, frequently, interpreted, as, a, symbol, of, gatsby, s, unrealizable, goal, to, win, daisy, and, consequently, to, achieve, the, american, dream, also, scholar, sarah, churchwell, points, out, that, adultery, in, the, novel, is, linked, to, the, loss, of, faith, and, broken, promises, which, symbolizes, the, corruption, of, the, american, dream, scholars, and, writers, commonly, ascribe, gatsby, s, inability, to, achieve, the, american, dream, to, entrenched, class, disparities, in, american, society, the, novel, underscores, the, limits, of, the, american, lower, class, to, transcend, their, station, of, birth, scholar, sarah, churchwell, contends, that, fitzgerald, s, novel, is, a, tale, of, class, warfare, in, a, status, obsessed, country, that, refuses, to, acknowledge, publicly, it, even, has, a, class, system, although, scholars, posit, different, explanations, for, the, continuation, of, class, differences, in, the, united, states, there, is, a, consensus, regarding, the, novel, s, message, in, conveying, its, underlying, permanence, although, gatsby, s, fundamental, conflict, occurs, between, entrenched, sources, of, socio, economic, power, and, upstarts, like, gatsby, who, threaten, their, interests, fitzgerald, s, novel, shows, that, a, class, permanence, persists, despite, the, country, s, capitalist, economy, that, prizes, innovation, and, adaptability, dianne, bechtel, argues, fitzgerald, plotted, the, novel, to, illustrate, that, class, transcends, wealth, in, america, even, if, the, poorer, americans, become, rich, they, remain, inferior, to, those, americans, with, old, money, consequently, gatsby, and, other, characters, in, the, novel, are, trapped, in, a, rigid, american, class, system, besides, exploring, the, difficulties, of, achieving, the, american, dream, the, great, gatsby, explores, societal, gender, expectations, during, the, jazz, age, the, character, of, daisy, buchanan, has, been, identified, specifically, as, personifying, the, emerging, cultural, archetype, of, the, flapper, flappers, were, typically, young, modern, women, who, bobbed, their, hair, and, wore, short, skirts, they, also, drank, alcohol, and, had, premarital, sex, despite, the, newfound, societal, freedoms, attained, by, flappers, in, the, 1920s, fitzgerald, s, work, critically, examines, the, continued, limitations, upon, women, s, agency, during, this, period, in, this, context, although, early, critics, viewed, the, character, of, daisy, to, be, a, monster, of, bitchery, later, scholars, such, as, leland, s, person, jr, asserted, that, daisy, s, character, exemplifies, the, marginalization, of, women, in, the, elite, social, environment, that, fitzgerald, depicts, writing, in, 1978, person, noted, daisy, is, more, of, a, hapless, victim, than, a, manipulative, victimizer, she, is, the, target, first, of, tom, s, callous, domination, and, next, of, gatsby, s, dehumanizing, adoration, she, involuntarily, becomes, the, holy, grail, at, the, center, of, gatsby, s, unrealistic, quest, to, be, steadfast, to, a, youthful, concept, of, himself, the, ensuing, contest, of, wills, between, tom, and, gatsby, reduces, daisy, to, a, trophy, wife, whose, sole, existence, is, to, augment, her, possessor, s, socio, economic, success, as, an, upper, class, white, woman, living, in, east, egg, during, this, time, period, daisy, must, adhere, to, societal, expectations, and, gender, norms, such, as, actively, fulfilling, the, roles, of, dutiful, wife, nurturing, mother, and, charming, socialite, many, of, daisy, s, choices, ultimately, culminating, in, the, fatal, car, crash, and, misery, for, all, those, involved, can, be, partly, attributed, to, her, prescribed, role, as, a, beautiful, little, fool, who, is, reliant, on, her, husband, for, financial, and, societal, security, her, decision, to, remain, with, her, husband, despite, her, feelings, for, gatsby, is, because, of, the, security, that, her, marriage, to, tom, buchanan, provides, many, scholars, have, analyzed, the, novel, s, treatment, of, race, and, displacement, in, particular, a, perceived, threat, posed, by, newer, immigrants, to, older, americans, triggering, concerns, over, a, loss, of, socio, economic, status, in, one, instance, tom, buchanan, the, novel, s, antagonist, claims, that, he, nick, and, jordan, are, racially, superior, nordics, tom, decries, immigration, and, advocates, white, supremacy, a, fictional, book, alluded, to, by, tom, is, goddard, s, the, rise, of, the, colored, empires, which, is, a, parody, by, fitzgerald, of, lothrop, stoddard, s, the, rising, tide, of, color, a, 1920s, bestseller, stoddard, warned, that, immigration, would, alter, america, s, racial, composition, and, destroy, the, country, analyzing, these, elements, literary, theorist, walter, benn, michaels, contends, that, fitzgerald, s, novel, reflects, a, historical, period, in, american, literature, characterized, by, fears, over, the, influx, of, southern, and, eastern, european, immigrants, whose, otherness, challenged, americans, sense, of, national, identity, such, anxieties, were, more, salient, in, national, discourse, than, the, societal, consequences, of, world, war, i, and, the, defining, question, of, the, period, was, who, constituted, a, real, american, in, this, context, of, immigration, and, displacement, tom, s, hostility, towards, gatsby, who, is, the, embodiment, of, latest, america, has, been, interpreted, as, partly, embodying, status, anxieties, of, the, time, involving, anti, immigrant, sentiment, gatsby, whom, tom, belittles, as, mr, nobody, from, nowhere, functions, as, a, cipher, because, of, his, obscure, origins, his, unclear, ethno, religious, identity, and, his, indeterminate, class, status, although, his, ethnicity, is, vague, his, last, name, gatz, and, his, father, s, adherence, to, the, lutheran, religion, indicate, his, family, are, recent, german, immigrants, this, would, preclude, them, from, the, coveted, status, of, old, stock, americans, consequently, gatsby, s, socio, economic, ascent, is, deemed, a, threat, not, only, due, to, his, status, as, nouveau, riche, but, because, he, is, perceived, as, an, outsider, because, of, such, themes, the, great, gatsby, captures, the, perennial, american, experience, as, it, is, a, story, about, change, and, those, who, resist, it, whether, such, change, comes, in, the, form, of, a, new, wave, of, immigrants, the, nouveau, riche, or, successful, minorities, since, americans, living, in, the, 1920s, to, the, present, are, largely, defined, by, their, fluctuating, socio, economic, circumstances, and, must, navigate, a, society, with, entrenched, racial, and, ethnic, prejudices, fitzgerald, s, depiction, of, resultant, status, anxieties, and, social, conflict, has, been, highlighted, by, scholars, as, still, enduringly, relevant, nearly, a, hundred, years, after, the, novel, s, publication, questions, regarding, the, sexuality, of, characters, have, been, raised, for, decades, and, augmented, by, biographical, details, about, the, author, have, given, rise, to, queer, readings, during, his, lifetime, fitzgerald, s, sexuality, became, a, subject, of, debate, among, his, friends, and, acquaintances, as, a, youth, fitzgerald, had, a, close, relationship, with, father, sigourney, fay, a, possibly, gay, catholic, priest, and, fitzgerald, later, used, his, last, name, for, the, idealized, romantic, character, of, daisy, fay, after, college, fitzgerald, cross, dressed, during, outings, in, minnesota, years, later, while, drafting, the, great, gatsby, rumors, dogged, fitzgerald, among, the, american, expat, community, in, paris, that, he, was, gay, soon, after, fitzgerald, s, wife, zelda, fitzgerald, likewise, doubted, his, heterosexuality, and, asserted, that, he, was, a, closeted, homosexual, she, publicly, belittled, him, with, homophobic, slurs, and, she, alleged, that, fitzgerald, and, fellow, writer, ernest, hemingway, engaged, in, homosexual, relations, these, incidents, strained, the, fitzgeralds, marriage, at, the, time, of, the, novel, s, publication, although, fitzgerald, s, sexuality, is, a, subject, of, scholarly, debate, such, biographical, details, lent, credence, to, critical, interpretations, that, his, fictional, characters, are, either, gay, or, bisexual, surrogates, as, early, as, 1945, critics, such, as, lionel, trilling, noted, that, characters, in, the, great, gatsby, such, as, jordan, baker, were, implied, to, be, vaguely, homosexual, and, in, 1960, writer, otto, friedrich, commented, upon, the, ease, of, examining, the, thwarted, relations, depicted, in, fitzgerald, s, fiction, through, a, queer, lens, in, recent, decades, scholarship, has, focused, sharply, on, the, sexuality, of, nick, carraway, in, one, instance, in, the, novel, carraway, departs, a, drunken, orgy, with, a, pale, feminine, man, named, mr, mckee, and, following, suggestive, ellipses, nick, next, finds, himself, standing, beside, a, bed, while, mckee, sits, between, the, sheets, clad, only, in, his, underwear, such, scenes, have, led, scholars, to, describe, nick, as, possessing, an, overt, queerness, and, prompted, analyses, about, his, emotional, attachment, to, jay, gatsby, for, these, reasons, the, novel, has, been, described, as, an, exploration, of, sexual, identity, during, a, historical, era, typified, by, the, societal, transition, towards, modernity, technological, and, environmental, criticisms, of, gatsby, seek, to, place, the, novel, and, its, characters, in, a, broader, historical, context, in, 1964, leo, marx, argued, in, the, machine, in, the, garden, that, fitzgerald, s, work, evinces, a, tension, between, a, complex, pastoral, ideal, of, a, bygone, america, and, the, societal, transformations, caused, by, industrialization, and, machine, technology, specifically, the, valley, of, the, ashes, in, between, east, and, west, egg, represents, a, man, made, wasteland, which, is, a, byproduct, of, the, industrialization, that, has, made, gatsby, s, booming, lifestyle, including, his, automobile, possible, marx, argues, that, fitzgerald, via, nick, expresses, a, pastoral, longing, typical, of, other, 1920s, american, writers, like, william, faulkner, and, ernest, hemingway, although, such, writers, cherish, the, pastoral, ideal, they, accept, that, technological, progress, has, deprived, this, ideal, of, nearly, all, meaning, in, this, context, nick, s, repudiation, of, the, eastern, united, states, represents, a, futile, attempt, to, withdraw, into, nature, yet, as, fitzgerald, s, work, shows, any, technological, demarcation, between, the, eastern, and, western, united, states, has, vanished, and, one, cannot, escape, into, a, pastoral, past, in, 2018, scholar, kyle, keeler, argued, that, the, voracious, pursuit, of, wealth, as, criticized, in, fitzgerald, s, novel, offers, a, warning, about, the, perils, of, environmental, destruction, in, pursuit, of, self, interest, according, to, kyle, keeler, gatsby, s, quest, for, greater, status, manifests, as, self, centered, anthropocentric, resource, acquisition, inspired, by, the, predatory, mining, practices, of, his, fictional, mentor, dan, cody, gatsby, participates, in, extensive, deforestation, amid, world, war, i, and, then, undertakes, bootlegging, activities, reliant, upon, exploiting, south, american, agriculture, gatsby, conveniently, ignores, the, wasteful, devastation, of, the, valley, of, ashes, to, pursue, a, consumerist, lifestyle, and, exacerbates, the, wealth, gap, that, became, increasingly, salient, in, 1920s, america, for, these, reasons, keeler, argues, that, while, gatsby, s, socioeconomic, ascent, and, self, transformation, depend, upon, these, very, factors, each, one, is, nonetheless, partially, responsible, for, the, ongoing, ecological, crisis, the, great, gatsby, has, been, accused, of, antisemitism, because, of, its, use, of, jewish, stereotypes, one, of, the, novel, s, supporting, characters, is, meyer, wolfsheim, a, jewish, friend, and, mentor, of, gatsby, a, corrupt, profiteer, who, assists, gatsby, s, bootlegging, operations, and, who, fixed, the, 1919, world, series, he, appears, only, twice, in, the, novel, the, second, time, refusing, to, attend, gatsby, s, funeral, fitzgerald, describes, wolfsheim, as, a, small, flat, nosed, jew, with, tiny, eyes, and, two, fine, growths, of, hair, in, his, nostrils, evoking, ethnic, stereotypes, regarding, the, jewish, nose, he, describes, wolfsheim, s, nose, as, expressive, tragic, and, able, to, flash, indignantly, the, fictional, character, of, wolfsheim, is, an, allusion, to, real, life, jewish, gambler, arnold, rothstein, a, notorious, new, york, crime, kingpin, whom, fitzgerald, met, once, in, undetermined, circumstances, rothstein, was, blamed, for, match, fixing, in, the, black, sox, scandal, that, tainted, the, 1919, world, series, wolfsheim, has, been, interpreted, as, representing, the, jewish, miser, stereotype, richard, levy, author, of, antisemitism, a, historical, encyclopedia, of, prejudice, and, persecution, claims, that, wolfsheim, serves, to, link, jewishness, with, corruption, in, a, 1947, article, for, commentary, milton, hindus, an, assistant, professor, of, humanities, at, the, university, of, chicago, stated, that, while, he, believed, the, book, was, a, superb, literary, achievement, wolfsheim, was, its, most, abrasive, character, and, the, work, contains, an, antisemitic, undertone, however, hindus, argued, the, jewish, stereotypes, displayed, by, wolfsheim, were, typical, of, the, time, when, the, novel, was, written, and, set, and, that, its, antisemitism, was, of, the, habitual, customary, harmless, unpolitical, variety, a, 2015, article, by, essayist, arthur, krystal, agreed, with, hindus, assessment, that, fitzgerald, s, use, of, jewish, caricatures, was, not, driven, by, malice, and, merely, reflected, commonly, held, beliefs, of, his, time, he, notes, the, accounts, of, frances, kroll, a, jewish, woman, and, secretary, to, fitzgerald, who, claimed, that, fitzgerald, was, hurt, by, accusations, of, antisemitism, and, responded, to, critiques, of, wolfsheim, by, claiming, he, merely, fulfilled, a, function, in, the, story, and, had, nothing, to, do, with, race, or, religion, gatsby, has, been, adapted, for, the, stage, the,
