acting, is, an, activity, in, which, a, story, is, told, by, means, of, its, enactment, by, an, actor, who, adopts, a, character, in, theatre, television, film, radio, or, any, other, medium, that, makes, use, of, the, mimetic, mode, acting, involves, a, broad, range, of, skills, including, a, well, developed, imagination, emotional, facility, physical, expressivity, vocal, projection, clarity, of, speech, and, the, ability, to, interpret, drama, acting, also, demands, an, ability, to, employ, dialects, accents, improvisation, observation, and, emulation, mime, and, stage, combat, many, actors, train, at, length, in, specialist, programs, or, colleges, to, develop, these, skills, the, vast, majority, of, professional, actors, have, gone, through, extensive, training, actors, and, actresses, will, often, have, many, instructors, and, teachers, for, a, full, range, of, training, involving, singing, scene, work, audition, techniques, and, acting, for, camera, most, early, sources, in, the, west, that, examine, the, art, of, acting, greek, hypokrisis, discuss, it, as, part, of, rhetoric, one, of, the, first, known, actors, was, an, ancient, greek, called, thespis, of, icaria, in, athens, writing, two, centuries, after, the, event, aristotle, in, his, poetics, c, 335, bce, suggests, that, thespis, stepped, out, of, the, dithyrambic, chorus, and, addressed, it, as, a, separate, character, before, thespis, the, chorus, narrated, for, example, dionysus, did, this, dionysus, said, when, thespis, stepped, out, from, the, chorus, he, spoke, as, if, he, were, the, character, for, example, i, am, dionysus, i, did, this, to, distinguish, between, these, different, modes, of, storytelling, enactment, and, narration, aristotle, uses, the, terms, mimesis, via, enactment, and, diegesis, via, narration, from, the, greek, actor, thespis, name, derives, the, word, thespian, conservatories, and, drama, schools, typically, offer, two, to, four, year, training, on, all, aspects, of, acting, universities, mostly, offer, three, to, four, year, programs, in, which, a, student, is, often, able, to, choose, to, focus, on, acting, whilst, continuing, to, learn, about, other, aspects, of, theatre, schools, vary, in, their, approach, but, in, north, america, the, most, popular, method, taught, derives, from, the, system, of, konstantin, stanislavski, which, was, developed, and, popularised, in, america, as, method, acting, by, lee, strasberg, stella, adler, sanford, meisner, and, others, other, approaches, may, include, a, more, physically, based, orientation, such, as, that, promoted, by, theatre, practitioners, as, diverse, as, anne, bogart, jacques, lecoq, jerzy, grotowski, or, vsevolod, meyerhold, classes, may, also, include, psychotechnique, mask, work, physical, theatre, improvisation, and, acting, for, camera, regardless, of, a, school, s, approach, students, should, expect, intensive, training, in, textual, interpretation, voice, and, movement, applications, to, drama, programmes, and, conservatories, usually, involve, extensive, auditions, anybody, over, the, age, of, 18, can, usually, apply, training, may, also, start, at, a, very, young, age, acting, classes, and, professional, schools, targeted, at, under, 18s, are, widespread, these, classes, introduce, young, actors, to, different, aspects, of, acting, and, theatre, including, scene, study, increased, training, and, exposure, to, public, speaking, allows, people, to, maintain, a, calmer, and, more, relaxed, physiology, measuring, a, public, speaker, s, heart, rate, is, perhaps, one, of, the, easiest, ways, to, assess, changes, in, stress, as, heart, rate, increases, with, anxiety, as, actors, increase, their, performances, heart, rate, and, other, signs, of, stress, may, decrease, this, is, very, important, in, training, actors, as, adaptive, strategies, gained, from, increased, exposure, to, public, speaking, can, regulate, implicit, and, explicit, anxiety, by, attending, an, institution, that, specializes, in, acting, the, increased, opportunity, to, act, will, lead, to, a, more, relaxed, physiology, and, a, decrease, in, stress, and, its, effects, on, the, body, these, effects, can, range, from, hormonal, to, cognitive, health, that, can, impact, quality, of, life, and, performance, some, classical, forms, of, acting, involve, a, substantial, element, of, improvised, performance, most, notable, is, its, use, by, the, troupes, of, the, commedia, dell, arte, a, form, of, masked, comedy, that, originated, in, italy, improvisation, as, an, approach, to, acting, formed, an, important, part, of, the, russian, theatre, practitioner, konstantin, stanislavski, s, system, of, actor, training, which, he, developed, from, the, 1910s, onwards, late, in, 1910, the, playwright, maxim, gorky, invited, stanislavski, to, join, him, in, capri, where, they, discussed, training, and, stanislavski, s, emerging, grammar, of, acting, inspired, by, a, popular, theatre, performance, in, naples, that, utilised, the, techniques, of, the, commedia, dell, arte, gorky, suggested, that, they, form, a, company, modelled, on, the, medieval, strolling, players, in, which, a, playwright, and, group, of, young, actors, would, devise, new, plays, together, by, means, of, improvisation, stanislavski, would, develop, this, use, of, improvisation, in, his, work, with, his, first, studio, of, the, moscow, art, theatre, stanislavski, s, use, was, extended, further, in, the, approaches, to, acting, developed, by, his, students, michael, chekhov, and, maria, knebel, in, the, united, kingdom, the, use, of, improvisation, was, pioneered, by, joan, littlewood, from, the, 1930s, onwards, and, later, by, keith, johnstone, and, clive, barker, in, the, united, states, it, was, promoted, by, viola, spolin, after, working, with, neva, boyd, at, a, hull, house, in, chicago, illinois, spolin, was, boyd, s, student, from, 1924, to, 1927, like, the, british, practitioners, spolin, felt, that, playing, games, was, a, useful, means, of, training, actors, and, helped, to, improve, an, actor, s, performance, with, improvisation, she, argued, people, may, find, expressive, freedom, since, they, do, not, know, how, an, improvised, situation, will, turn, out, improvisation, demands, an, open, mind, in, order, to, maintain, spontaneity, rather, than, pre, planning, a, response, a, character, is, created, by, the, actor, often, without, reference, to, a, dramatic, text, and, a, drama, is, developed, out, of, the, spontaneous, interactions, with, other, actors, this, approach, to, creating, new, drama, has, been, developed, most, substantially, by, the, british, filmmaker, mike, leigh, in, films, such, as, secrets, lies, 1996, vera, drake, 2004, another, year, 2010, and, mr, turner, 2014, improvisation, is, also, used, to, cover, up, if, an, actor, or, actress, makes, a, mistake, acting, in, front, of, an, audience, many, times, can, cause, stage, fright, a, form, of, stress, in, which, someone, becomes, anxious, in, front, of, an, audience, this, is, common, among, actors, especially, new, actors, and, can, cause, symptoms, such, as, increased, heart, rate, increased, blood, pressure, and, sweating, in, a, 2017, study, on, american, university, students, actors, of, various, experience, levels, all, showed, similarly, elevated, heart, rates, throughout, their, performances, this, agrees, with, previous, studies, on, professional, and, amateur, actors, heart, rates, while, all, actors, experienced, stress, causing, elevated, heart, rate, the, more, experienced, actors, displayed, less, heart, rate, variability, than, the, less, experienced, actors, in, the, same, play, the, more, experienced, actors, experienced, less, stress, while, performing, and, therefore, had, a, smaller, degree, of, variability, than, the, less, experienced, more, stressed, actors, the, more, experienced, an, actor, is, the, more, stable, their, heart, rate, will, be, while, performing, but, will, still, experience, elevated, heart, rates, the, semiotics, of, acting, involves, a, study, of, the, ways, in, which, aspects, of, a, performance, come, to, operate, for, its, audience, as, signs, this, process, largely, involves, the, production, of, meaning, whereby, elements, of, an, actor, s, performance, acquire, significance, both, within, the, broader, context, of, the, dramatic, action, and, in, the, relations, each, establishes, with, the, real, world, following, the, ideas, proposed, by, the, surrealist, theorist, antonin, artaud, however, it, may, also, be, possible, to, understand, communication, with, an, audience, that, occurs, beneath, significance, and, meaning, which, the, semiotician, f, lix, guattari, described, as, a, process, involving, the, transmission, of, a, signifying, signs, in, his, the, theatre, and, its, double, 1938, artaud, compared, this, interaction, to, the, way, in, which, a, snake, charmer, communicates, with, a, snake, a, process, which, he, identified, as, mimesis, the, same, term, that, aristotle, in, his, poetics, c, 335, bce, used, to, describe, the, mode, in, which, drama, communicates, its, story, by, virtue, of, its, embodiment, by, the, actor, enacting, it, as, distinct, from, diegesis, or, the, way, in, which, a, narrator, may, describe, it, these, vibrations, passing, from, the, actor, to, the, audience, may, not, necessarily, precipitate, into, significant, elements, as, such, that, is, consciously, perceived, meanings, but, rather, may, operate, by, means, of, the, circulation, of, affects, the, approach, to, acting, adopted, by, other, theatre, practitioners, involve, varying, degrees, of, concern, with, the, semiotics, of, acting, konstantin, stanislavski, for, example, addresses, the, ways, in, which, an, actor, building, on, what, he, calls, the, experiencing, of, a, role, should, also, shape, and, adjust, a, performance, in, order, to, support, the, overall, significance, of, the, drama, a, process, that, he, calls, establishing, the, perspective, of, the, role, the, semiotics, of, acting, plays, a, far, more, central, role, in, bertolt, brecht, s, epic, theatre, in, which, an, actor, is, concerned, to, bring, out, clearly, the, socio, historical, significance, of, behaviour, and, action, by, means, of, specific, performance, choices, a, process, that, he, describes, as, establishing, the, not, but, element, in, a, performed, physical, gestus, within, context, of, the, play, s, overall, fabel, eugenio, barba, argues, that, actors, ought, not, to, concern, themselves, with, the, significance, of, their, performance, behaviour, this, aspect, is, the, responsibility, he, claims, of, the, director, who, weaves, the, signifying, elements, of, an, actor, s, performance, into, the, director, s, dramaturgical, montage, the, theatre, semiotician, patrice, pavis, alluding, to, the, contrast, between, stanislavski, s, system, and, brecht, s, demonstrating, performer, and, beyond, that, to, denis, diderot, s, foundational, essay, on, the, art, of, acting, paradox, of, the, actor, c, 1770, 78, argues, that, acting, was, long, seen, in, terms, of, the, actor, s, sincerity, or, hypocrisy, should, he, believe, in, what, he, is, saying, and, be, moved, by, it, or, should, he, distance, himself, and, convey, his, role, in, a, detached, manner, the, answer, varies, according, to, how, one, sees, the, effect, to, be, produced, in, the, audience, and, the, social, function, of, theatre, elements, of, a, semiotics, of, acting, include, the, actor, s, gestures, facial, expressions, intonation, and, other, vocal, qualities, rhythm, and, the, ways, in, which, these, aspects, of, an, individual, performance, relate, to, the, drama, and, the, theatrical, event, or, film, television, programme, or, radio, broadcast, each, of, which, involves, different, semiotic, systems, considered, as, a, whole, a, semiotics, of, acting, recognises, that, all, forms, of, acting, involve, conventions, and, codes, by, means, of, which, performance, behaviour, acquires, significance, including, those, approaches, such, as, stanislvaski, s, or, the, closely, related, method, acting, developed, in, the, united, states, that, offer, themselves, as, a, natural, kind, of, acting, that, can, do, without, conventions, and, be, received, as, self, evident, and, universal, pavis, goes, on, to, argue, that, any, acting, is, based, on, a, codified, system, even, if, the, audience, does, not, see, it, as, such, of, behaviour, and, actions, that, are, considered, to, be, believable, and, realistic, or, artificial, and, theatrical, to, advocate, the, natural, the, spontaneous, and, the, instinctive, is, only, to, attempt, to, produce, natural, effects, governed, by, an, ideological, code, that, determines, at, a, particular, historical, time, and, for, a, given, audience, what, is, natural, and, believable, and, what, is, declamatory, and, theatrical, the, conventions, that, govern, acting, in, general, are, related, to, structured, forms, of, play, which, involve, in, each, specific, experience, rules, of, the, game, this, aspect, was, first, explored, by, johan, huizinga, in, homo, ludens, 1938, and, roger, caillois, in, man, play, and, games, 1958, caillois, for, example, distinguishes, four, aspects, of, play, relevant, to, acting, mimesis, simulation, agon, conflict, or, competition, alea, chance, and, ilinx, vertigo, or, vertiginous, psychological, situations, involving, the, spectator, s, identification, or, catharsis, this, connection, with, play, as, an, activity, was, first, proposed, by, aristotle, in, his, poetics, in, which, he, defines, the, desire, to, imitate, in, play, as, an, essential, part, of, being, human, and, our, first, means, of, learning, as, children, for, it, is, an, instinct, of, human, beings, from, childhood, to, engage, in, mimesis, indeed, this, distinguishes, them, from, other, animals, man, is, the, most, mimetic, of, all, and, it, is, through, mimesis, that, he, develops, his, earliest, understanding, and, equally, natural, that, everyone, enjoys, mimetic, objects, iv, 1448b, this, connection, with, play, also, informed, the, words, used, in, english, as, was, the, analogous, case, in, many, other, european, languages, for, drama, the, word, play, or, game, translating, the, anglo, saxon, pl, ga, or, latin, ludus, was, the, standard, term, used, until, william, shakespeare, s, time, for, a, dramatic, entertainment, just, as, its, creator, was, a, play, maker, rather, than, a, dramatist, the, person, acting, was, known, as, a, player, and, when, in, the, elizabethan, era, specific, buildings, for, acting, were, built, they, were, known, as, play, houses, rather, than, theatres, actors, and, actresses, need, to, make, a, resume, when, applying, for, roles, the, acting, resume, is, very, different, from, a, normal, resume, it, is, generally, shorter, with, lists, instead, of, paragraphs, and, it, should, have, a, head, shot, on, the, back, sometimes, a, resume, also, contains, a, short, 30, second, to, 1, minute, reel, displaying, the, actor, s, abilities, so, that, the, casting, director, can, see, previous, performances, if, any, an, actor, s, resume, should, list, projects, they, have, acted, in, before, such, as, plays, movies, or, shows, as, well, as, special, skills, and, their, contact, information, auditioning, is, the, act, of, performing, either, a, monologue, or, sides, lines, for, one, character, as, sent, by, the, casting, director, auditioning, entails, showing, the, actor, s, skills, to, present, themselves, as, a, different, person, it, may, be, as, brief, as, two, minutes, for, theater, auditions, it, can, be, longer, than, two, minutes, or, they, may, perform, more, than, one, monologue, as, each, casting, director, can, have, different, requirements, for, actors, actors, should, go, to, auditions, dressed, for, the, part, to, make, it, easier, for, the, casting, director, to, visualize, them, as, the, character, for, television, or, film, they, will, have, to, undergo, more, than, one, audition, oftentimes, actors, are, called, into, another, audition, at, the, last, minute, and, are, sent, the, sides, either, that, morning, or, the, night, before, auditioning, can, be, a, stressful, part, of, acting, especially, if, one, has, not, been, trained, to, audition, rehearsal, is, a, process, in, which, actors, prepare, and, practice, a, performance, together, with, directors, and, technical, staff, some, actors, continue, to, rehearse, a, scene, throughout, the, run, of, a, show, in, order, to, keep, the, scene, fresh, in, their, minds, and, exciting, for, the, audience, a, critical, audience, with, evaluative, spectators, is, known, to, induce, stress, on, actors, during, performance, while, public, performances, cause, extremely, high, stress, levels, in, actors, more, so, amateur, ones, the, stress, actually, improves, the, performance, supporting, the, idea, of, positive, stress, in, challenging, situations, depending, on, what, an, actor, is, doing, his, or, her, heart, rate, will, vary, this, is, the, body, s, way, of, responding, to, stress, prior, to, a, show, one, will, see, an, increase, in, heart, rate, due, to, anxiety, while, performing, an, actor, has, an, increased, sense, of, exposure, which, will, increase, performance, anxiety, and, the, associated, physiological, arousal, such, as, heart, rate, heart, rates, increases, more, during, shows, compared, to, rehearsals, because, of, the, increased, pressure, which, is, due, to, the, fact, that, a, performance, has, a, potentially, greater, impact, on, an, actors, career, after, the, show, a, decrease, in, the, heart, rate, due, to, the, conclusion, of, the, stress, inducing, activity, can, be, seen, often, the, heart, rate, will, return, to, normal, after, the, show, or, performance, is, done, however, during, the, applause, after, the, performance, there, is, a, rapid, spike, in, heart, rate, this, can, be, seen, not, only, in, actors, but, also, with, public, speaking, and, musicians, there, is, a, correlation, between, heart, rate, and, stress, when, actors, are, performing, in, front, of, an, audience, actors, claim, that, having, an, audience, has, no, change, in, their, stress, level, but, as, soon, as, they, come, on, stage, their, heart, rate, rises, quickly, a, 2017, study, done, in, an, american, university, looking, at, actors, stress, by, measuring, heart, rate, showed, individual, heart, rates, rose, right, before, the, performance, began, for, those, actors, opening, there, are, many, factors, that, can, add, to, an, actors, stress, for, example, length, of, monologues, experience, level, and, actions, done, on, stage, including, moving, the, set, throughout, the, performance, heart, rate, rises, the, most, before, an, actor, is, speaking, the, stress, and, thus, heart, rate, of, the, actor, then, drops, significantly, at, the, end, of, a, monologue, big, action, scene, or, performance
