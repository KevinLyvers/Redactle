khaldun, in, 1377, which, presents, a, view, of, universal, history, some, modern, thinkers, view, it, as, the, first, work, dealing, with, the, social, sciences, of, sociology, demography, and, cultural, history, the, muqaddimah, also, deals, with, islamic, theology, historiography, the, philosophy, of, history, economics, political, theory, and, ecology, it, has, also, been, described, as, a, precursor, or, an, early, representative, of, social, darwinism, and, darwinism, ibn, khaldun, wrote, the, work, in, 1377, as, the, introduction, and, the, first, book, of, his, planned, work, of, world, history, the, kitab, al, ibar, book, of, lessons, full, title, kit, bu, l, ibari, wa, d, w, ni, l, mubtada, wal, abar, f, ay, mi, l, arab, wal, ajam, wal, barbar, waman, sarahum, min, dhaw, sh,

in, his, lifetime, it, became, regarded, as, an, independent, work, on, its, own, muqaddimah, is, an, arabic, word, used, to, mean, prologue, or, introduction, to, introduce, a, larger, work, ibn, khaldun, wrote, the, first, version, of, the, muqaddimah, in, qal, at, ibn, salama, where, he, secluded, himself, for, almost, four, years, after, withdrawing, from, political, life, it, is, the, first, of, three, parts, of, a, project, he, worked, on, for, almost, thirty, years, his, kitab, al, ibar, a, massive, work, of, universal, history, filling, seventeen, volumes, of, 500, pages, each, in, its, modern, edition, a, draft, of, the, muqaddimah, was, completed, in, 1377, manuscripts, of, the, muqaddimah, copied, in, the, lifetime, of, ibn, khaldun, are, extant, and, a, number, of, them, have, autographed, marginal, notes, or, additions, in, the, muqaddimah, ibn, khaldun, expounds, on, a, new, science, around, which, he, had, maintained, secrecy, up, until, his, retirement, to, qal, at, ibn, salama, a, new, science, for, the, study, of, what, he, calls, umr, n, this, new, science, ilm, al, umr, n, is, based, on, greco, arab, philosophy, and, seeks, to, study, the, evolution, of, humankind, and, society, throughout, history, using, a, method, that, is, essentially, historical, empirical, rational, and, demonstrative, the, muqaddimah, shaped, by, ibn, khaldun, s, characteristic, moderation, with, regard, to, politics, and, religion, was, met, without, much, enthusiasm, or, clear, hostility, in, the, first, few, centuries, after, it, was, written, it, was, alluded, to, in, the, works, of, two, moroccan, writers, mu, ammad, ibn, al, sakk, k, d, 1413, and, ya, q, b, b, m, s, al, sayt, n, but, mu, ammad, b, al, ibn, al, azraq, d, 1496, is, apparently, the, only, contemporary, writer, of, the, maghreb, who, clearly, approved, of, his, work, quoting, from, it, abundantly, in, his, bad, i, al, silk, f, ab, i, al, mulk, it, was, cited, more, often, in, works, from, egypt, celebrated, by, disciples, including, al, maqrizi, 1364, 1442, and, ibn, amm, r, and, met, with, hostility, by, others, such, as, ibn, hajar, al, asqalani, and, his, master, nur, al, din, al, haythami, in, the, following, centuries, khaldun, appeared, prominently, described, as, an, authority, on, political, history, in, numerous, biographical, dictionaries, especially, in, ahmed, muhammad, al, maqqari, s, naf, al, b, min, ghu, n, al, andalus, al, ra, b, but, the, muqaddimah, remained, largely, absent, ottoman, historians, including, k, tip, elebi, d, 1657, and, mustafa, naima, d, 1716, valued, the, social, and, political, theories, in, the, muqaddimah, but, did, not, apply, them, in, the, analysis, of, their, own, society, the, first, five, out, of, six, chapters, were, translated, into, ottoman, turkish, by, mehmed, pirizade, d, 1749, and, the, sixth, chapter, was, translated, by, ahmed, cevdet, d, 1895, the, complete, translation, was, published, 1860, 61, the, muqaddimah, was, first, printed, in, 1857, at, the, bulaq, press, in, cairo, in, a, standalone, volume, made, by, na, r, al, h, r, n, with, crucial, support, from, rifa, a, at, tahtawi, and, as, the, first, volume, in, a, seven, volume, set, of, kitab, al, ibar, a, decade, later, abdesselam, cheddadi, concludes, that, the, strictly, scientific, contribution, of, ibn, khald, n, to, the, field, of, history, and, the, social, sciences, was, not, fully, recognised, in, the, muslim, world, until, the, late, nineteenth, century, the, muqaddimah, was, first, discovered, in, france, through, the, partial, turkish, translation, of, mehmed, pirizade, d, 1749, in, 1858, the, year, following, the, first, publication, in, cairo, tienne, marc, quatrem, re, printed, an, edition, of, the, arabic, text, of, the, muqaddimah, in, three, volumes, in, paris, under, the, title, les, prol, gom, nes, d, ebn, khaldoun, william, mcguckin, de, slane, published, a, french, translation, in, three, volumes, in, 1863, that, aziz, al, azmeh, regards, as, the, best, translation, of, ibn, khaldun, s, text, an, english, translation, was, published, by, franz, rosenthal, in, 1958, the, concept, of, asabiyyah, arabic, tribalism, clanism, communitarism, or, in, a, modern, context, group, feeling, social, cohesion, solidarity, or, even, nationalism, is, one, of, the, best, known, aspects, of, the, muqaddimah, as, this, asabiyyah, declines, another, more, compelling, asabiyyah, may, take, its, place, thus, civilizations, rise, and, fall, and, history, describes, these, cycles, of, asabiyyah, as, they, play, out, ibn, khaldun, argues, that, each, dynasty, has, within, itself, the, seeds, of, its, own, downfall, he, explains, that, ruling, houses, tend, to, emerge, on, the, peripheries, of, great, empires, and, use, the, unity, presented, by, those, areas, to, their, advantage, in, order, to, bring, about, a, change, in, leadership, as, the, new, rulers, establish, themselves, at, the, center, of, their, empire, they, become, increasingly, lax, and, more, concerned, with, maintaining, their, lifestyles, thus, a, new, dynasty, can, emerge, at, the, periphery, of, their, control, and, effect, a, change, in, leadership, beginning, the, cycle, anew, ibn, khaldun, wrote, on, economic, and, political, theory, in, the, muqaddimah, relating, his, thoughts, on, asabiyyah, to, the, division, of, labor, the, greater, the, social, cohesion, the, more, complex, the, division, may, be, the, greater, the, economic, growth, when, civilization, increases, the, available, labor, again, increases, in, turn, luxury, again, increases, in, correspondence, with, the, increasing, profit, and, the, customs, and, needs, of, luxury, increase, crafts, are, created, to, obtain, luxury, products, the, value, realized, from, them, increases, and, as, a, result, profits, are, again, multiplied, in, the, town, production, there, is, thriving, even, more, than, before, and, so, it, goes, with, the, second, and, third, increase, all, the, additional, labor, serves, luxury, and, wealth, in, contrast, to, the, original, labor, that, served, the, necessity, of, life, ibn, khaldun, noted, that, growth, and, development, positively, stimulate, both, supply, and, demand, and, that, the, forces, of, supply, and, demand, are, what, determine, the, prices, of, goods, he, also, noted, macroeconomic, forces, of, population, growth, human, capital, development, and, technological, developments, effects, on, development, ibn, khaldun, held, that, population, growth, was, a, function, of, wealth, he, understood, that, money, served, as, a, standard, of, value, a, medium, of, exchange, and, a, preserver, of, value, though, he, did, not, realize, that, the, value, of, gold, and, silver, changed, based, on, the, forces, of, supply, and, demand, ibn, khaldun, also, introduced, the, labor, theory, of, value, he, described, labor, as, the, source, of, value, necessary, for, all, earnings, and, capital, accumulation, obvious, in, the, case, of, craft, he, argued, that, even, if, earning, results, from, something, other, than, a, craft, the, value, of, the, resulting, profit, and, acquired, capital, must, also, include, the, value, of, the, labor, by, which, it, was, obtained, without, labor, it, would, not, have, been, acquired, ibn, khaldun, describes, a, theory, of, prices, through, his, understanding, that, prices, result, from, the, law, of, supply, and, demand, he, understood, that, when, a, good, is, scarce, and, in, demand, its, price, is, high, and, when, the, good, is, abundant, its, price, is, low, the, inhabitants, of, a, city, have, more, food, than, they, need, consequently, the, price, of, food, is, low, as, a, rule, except, when, misfortunes, occur, due, to, celestial, conditions, that, may, affect, food, his, theory, of, asabiyyah, has, often, been, compared, to, modern, keynesian, economics, with, ibn, khaldun, s, theory, clearly, containing, the, concept, of, the, multiplier, a, crucial, difference, however, is, that, whereas, for, john, maynard, keynes, it, is, the, middle, class, s, greater, propensity, to, save, that, is, to, blame, for, economic, depression, for, ibn, khaldun, it, is, the, governmental, propensity, to, save, at, times, when, investment, opportunities, do, not, take, up, the, slack, which, leads, to, aggregate, demand, another, modern, economic, theory, anticipated, by, ibn, khaldun, is, supply, side, economics, he, argued, that, high, taxes, were, often, a, factor, in, causing, empires, to, collapse, with, the, result, that, lower, revenue, was, collected, from, high, rates, he, wrote, it, should, be, known, that, at, the, beginning, of, the, dynasty, taxation, yields, a, large, revenue, from, small, assessments, at, the, end, of, the, dynasty, taxation, yields, a, small, revenue, from, large, assessments, ibn, khaldun, introduced, the, concept, now, popularly, known, as, the, laffer, curve, that, increases, in, tax, rates, initially, increase, tax, revenues, but, eventually, the, increases, in, tax, rates, cause, a, decrease, in, tax, revenues, this, occurs, as, too, high, a, tax, rate, discourages, producers, in, the, economy, ibn, khaldun, used, a, dialectic, approach, to, describe, the, sociological, implications, of, tax, choice, which, now, forms, a, part, of, economics, theory, in, the, early, stages, of, the, state, taxes, are, light, in, their, incidence, but, fetch, in, a, large, revenue, as, time, passes, and, kings, succeed, each, other, they, lose, their, tribal, habits, in, favor, of, more, civilized, ones, their, needs, and, exigencies, grow, owing, to, the, luxury, in, which, they, have, been, brought, up, hence, they, impose, fresh, taxes, on, their, subjects, and, sharply, raise, the, rate, of, old, taxes, to, increase, their, yield, but, the, effects, on, business, of, this, rise, in, taxation, make, themselves, felt, for, business, men, are, soon, discouraged, by, the, comparison, of, their, profits, with, the, burden, of, their, taxes, consequently, production, falls, off, and, with, it, the, yield, of, taxation, this, analysis, is, very, similar, to, the, modern, economic, concept, known, as, the, laffer, curve, laffer, does, not, claim, to, have, invented, the, concept, himself, noting, that, the, idea, was, present, in, the, work, of, ibn, khaldun, and, more, recently, john, maynard, keynes, the, muqaddimah, is, also, held, to, be, a, foundational, work, for, the, schools, of, historiography, cultural, history, and, the, philosophy, of, history, the, muqaddimah, also, laid, the, groundwork, for, the, observation, of, the, role, of, state, communication, propaganda, and, systematic, bias, in, history, franz, rosenthal, wrote, in, the, history, of, muslim, historiography, muslim, historiography, has, at, all, times, been, united, by, the, closest, ties, with, the, general, development, of, scholarship, in, islam, and, the, position, of, historical, knowledge, in, musiim, education, has, exercised, a, decisive, influence, upon, the, intellectual, level, of, historical, writing, the, muslims, achieved, a, definite, advance, beyond, previous, historical, writing, in, the, sociological, understanding, of, history, and, the, systematisation, of, historiography, the, development, of, modern, historical, writing, seems, to, have, gained, considerably, in, speed, and, substance, through, the, utilization, of, a, muslim, literature, which, enabled, western, historians, from, the, seventeenth, century, on, to, see, a, large, section, of, the, world, through, foreign, eyes, the, muslim, historiography, helped, indirectly, and, modestly, to, shape, present, day, historical, thinking, the, muqaddimah, states, that, history, is, a, philosophical, science, and, historians, should, attempt, to, refute, myths, ibn, khaldun, approached, the, past, as, strange, and, in, need, of, interpretation, the, originality, of, ibn, khaldun, was, to, claim, that, the, cultural, difference, of, another, age, must, govern, the, evaluation, of, relevant, historical, material, to, distinguish, the, principles, according, to, which, it, might, be, possible, to, attempt, the, evaluation, and, lastly, to, feel, the, need, for, experience, in, addition, to, rational, principles, in, order, to, assess, a, culture, of, the, past, ibn, khaldun, often, criticized, idle, superstition, and, uncritical, acceptance, of, historical, data, as, a, result, he, introduced, a, scientific, method, to, the, study, of, history, which, was, considered, something, new, to, his, age, and, he, often, referred, to, it, as, his, new, science, now, associated, with, historiography, x, ibn, khaldun, is, considered, a, pioneer, of, the, philosophy, of, history, dawood, writes, on, the, muqaddimah, it, can, be, regarded, as, the, earliest, attempt, made, by, any, historian, to, discover, a, pattern, in, the, changes, that, occur, in, man, s, political, and, social, organization, rational, in, its, approach, analytical, in, its, method, encyclopaedic, in, detail, it, represents, an, almost, complete, departure, from, traditional, historiography, discarding, conventional, concepts, and, cliches, and, seeking, beyond, the, mere, chronicle, of, events, an, explanation, and, hence, a, philosophy, of, history, ix, the, muqaddimah, emphasized, the, role, of, systemic, bias, in, affecting, the, standard, of, evidence, khaldun, was, quite, concerned, with, the, effect, of, raising, the, standard, of, evidence, when, confronted, with, uncomfortable, claims, and, relaxing, it, when, given, claims, that, seemed, reasonable, or, comfortable, he, was, a, jurist, and, sometimes, participated, reluctantly, in, rulings, that, he, felt, were, coerced, based, on, arguments, he, did, not, respect, besides, al, maqrizi, 1364, 1442, ibn, khaldun, s, focused, attempt, systematically, to, study, and, account, for, biases, in, the, creation, of, history, wouldn, t, be, seen, again, until, georg, hegel, karl, marx, and, friedrich, nietzsche, in, 19th, century, germany, and, arnold, j, toynbee, a, 20th, century, british, historian, ibn, khaldun, also, examines, why, throughout, history, it, has, been, common, for, historians, to, sensationalize, historical, events, and, in, particular, exaggerate, numerical, figures, whenever, contemporaries, speak, about, the, dynastic, armies, of, their, own, or, recent, times, and, whenever, they, engage, in, discussions, about, muslim, or, christian, soldiers, or, when, they, get, to, figuring, the, tax, revenues, and, the, money, spent, by, the, government, the, outlays, of, extravagant, spenders, and, the, goods, that, rich, and, prosperous, men, have, in, stock, they, are, quite, generally, found, to, exaggerate, to, go, beyond, the, bounds, of, the, ordinary, and, to, succumb, to, the, temptation, of, sensationalism, when, the, officials, in, charge, are, questioned, about, their, armies, when, the, goods, and, assets, of, wealthy, people, are, assessed, and, when, the, outlays, of, extravagant, spenders, are, looked, at, in, ordinary, light, the, figures, will, be, found, to, amount, to, a, tenth, of, what, those, people, have, said, the, reason, is, simple, it, is, the, common, desire, for, sensationalism, the, ease, with, which, one, may, just, mention, a, higher, figure, and, the, disregard, of, reviewers, and, critics, 13, 14, the, muqaddimah, contains, discussions, on, islamic, theology, which, show, that, ibn, khaldun, was, a, follower, of, the, orthodox, ash, ari, school, of, sunni, islamic, thought, and, a, supporter, of, al, ghazali, s, religious, views, he, was, also, a, critic, of, neoplatonism, particularly, its, notion, of, a, hierarchy, of, being, the, muqaddimah, covers, the, historical, development, of, kalam, and, the, different, schools, of, islamic, thought, notably, the, mu, tazili, and, ash, ari, schools, ibn, khaldun, being, a, follower, of, the, ash, ari, school, criticizes, the, views, of, the, mu, tazili, school, and, bases, his, criticisms, on, the, views, of, abu, al, hasan, al, ash, ari, whom, he, describes, as, the, mediator, between, different, approaches, in, the, kalam, ibn, khaldun, also, covers, the, historical, development, of, islamic, logic, in, the, context, of, theology, as, he, viewed, logic, as, being, distinct, from, early, islamic, philosophy, and, believed, that, philosophy, should, remain, separate, from, theology, the, book, also, contains, commentaries, on, verses, from, the, qur, an, ibn, khaldun, was, an, islamic, jurist, and, discussed, the, topics, of, sharia, islamic, law, and, fiqh, islamic, jurisprudence, in, his, muqaddimah, ibn, khaldun, wrote, that, jurisprudence, is, the, knowledge, of, the, classification, of, the, laws, of, god, in, regards, to, jurisprudence, he, acknowledged, the, inevitability, of, change, in, all, aspects, of, a, community, and, wrote, the, conditions, customs, and, beliefs, of, peoples, and, nations, do, not, indefinitely, follow, the, same, pattern, and, adhere, to, a, constant, course, there, is, rather, change, with, days, and, epochs, as, well, as, passing, from, one, state, to, another, such, is, the, law, of, god, that, has, taken, place, with, regard, to, his, subjects, ibn, khaldun, further, described, fiqh, jurisprudence, as, knowledge, of, the, rules, of, god, which, concern, the, actions, of, persons, who, own, themselves, bound, to, obey, the, law, respecting, what, is, required, wajib, forbidden, haraam, recommended, mand, b, disapproved, makruh, or, merely, permitted, mubah, some, of, ibn, khaldun, s, thoughts, according, to, some, commentators, anticipate, the, biological, theory, of, evolution, ibn, khaldun, asserted, that, humans, developed, from, the, world, of, the, monkeys, in, a, process, by, which, species, become, more, numerous, in, chapter, 1, of, the, muqaddimah, one, should, then, take, a, look, at, the, world, of, creation, it, started, out, from, the, minerals, and, progressed, in, an, ingenious, gradual, manner, to, plants, and, animals, the, last, stage, of, minerals, is, connected, with, the, first, stage, of, plants, such, as, herbs, and, seedless, plants, the, last, stage, of, plants, such, as, palms, and, vines, is, connected, with, the, first, stage, of, animals, such, as, snails, and, shellfish, which, have, only, the, power, of, touch, the, word, connection, with, regard, to, these, created, things, means, that, the, last, stage, of, each, group, is, fully, prepared, to, become, the, first, stage, of, the, newest, group, the, animal, world, then, widens, its, species, become, numerous, and, in, a, gradual, process, of, creation, it, finally, leads, to, man, who, is, able, to, think, and, reflect, the, higher, stage, of, man, is, reached, from, the, world, of, monkeys, in, which, both, sagacity, and, perception, are, found, but, which, has, not, reached, the, stage, of, actual, reflection, and, thinking, at, this, point, we, come, to, the, first, stage, of, man, this, is, as, far, as, our, physical, observation, extends, 137, 138, ibn, khaldun, believed, that, humans, are, the, most, evolved, form, of, animals, in, that, they, have, the, ability, to, reason, the, muqaddimah, also, states, in, chapter, 6, we, explained, there, that, the, whole, of, existence, in, all, its, simple, and, composite, worlds, is, arranged, in, a, natural, order, of, ascent, and, descent, so, that, everything, constitutes, an, uninterrupted, continuum, the, essences, at, the, end, of, each, particular, stage, of, the, worlds, are, by, nature, prepared, to, be, transformed, into, the, essence, adjacent, to, them, either, above, or, below, them, this, is, the, case, with, the, simple, material, elements, it, is, the, case, with, palms, and, vines, which, constitute, the, last, stage, of, plants, in, their, relation, to, snails, and, shellfish, which, constitute, the, lowest, stage, of, animals, it, is, also, the, case, with, monkeys, creatures, combining, in, themselves, cleverness, and, perception, in, their, relation, to, man, the, being, who, has, the, ability, to, think, and, to, reflect, the, preparedness, for, transformation, that, exists, on, either, side, at, each, stage, of, the, worlds, is, meant, when, we, speak, about, their, connection, 553, plants, do, not, have, the, same, fineness, and, power, that, animals, have, therefore, the, sages, rarely, turned, to, them, animals, are, the, last, and, final, stage, of, the, three, permutations, minerals, turn, into, plants, and, plants, into, animals, but, animals, cannot, turn, into, anything, finer, than, themselves, 691, his, evolutionary, ideas, appear, to, be, similar, to, those, found, in, the, encyclopedia, of, the, brethren, of, purity, ibn, khaldun, was, also, an, adherent, of, environmental, determinism, he, believed, that, the, black, skin, practices, and, customs, of, the, people, of, sub, saharan, africa, were, due, to, the, region, s, hot, climate, a, theory, that, according, to, rosenthal, may, have, been, influenced, by, the, greek, geographical, ideas, expounded, by, ptolemy, s, tetrabiblos, ibn, khaldun, viewed, the, hamitic, theory, where, the, sons, of, ham, became, black, as, the, result, of, a, curse, from, god, as, a, myth, shoaib, ahmed, malik, has, argued, that, ibn, khaldun, s, theory, while, remarkable, for, its, acceptance, of, the, kinship, between, monkeys, and, humans, should, be, understood, in, the, context, of, the, late, antique, and, medieval, concept, of, the, great, chain, of, being, this, theory, postulates, a, linked, hierarchy, between, all, entities, in, creation, but, is, not, properly, a, theory, of, evolution, the, system, of, the, great, chain, of, being, implies, a, graded, similarity, between, the, various, stages, in, the, hierarchy, from, minerals, to, plants, animals, humans, angels, and, god, but, not, a, temporal, process, in, which, one, species, originates, from, the, other, while, according, to, some, mystical, interpretations, individual, souls, may, move, up, the, ladder, in, order, to, reunite, with, the, divine, the, species, or, substantial, forms, in, the, language, of, aristotelian, and, neoplatonic, ontology, themselves, are, eternal, and, fixed, malik, states, that, quotes, from, the, muqadimmah, like, the, first, one, cite, above, are, often, given, without, proper, regard, for, their, context, the, quote, is, taken, from, a, section, called, the, real, meaning, of, prophecy, which, argues, that, prophets, occupy, a, place, in, the, great, chain, of, being, just, beneath, angels, in, ibn, khaldun, s, view, this, explains, why, individual, prophets, may, temporarily, ascend, to, the, rank, of, angels, and, share, with, them, in, the, knowledge, of, the, divine, which, they, may, then, bring, back, to, humanity, in, the, form, of, revelation, according, to, malik, interpretations, that, see, in, this, an, early, form, of, scientific, evolution, theory, ought, to, explain, how, angels, prophets, and, the, upwards, ascent, of, the, soul, fit, into, that, theory, ibn, khaldun, was, a, critic, of, the, practice, of, alchemy, the, muqaddimah, discusses, the, history, of, alchemy, the, views, of, alchemists, such, as, jabir, ibn, hayyan, and, the, theories, of, the, transmutation, of, metals, and, elixir, of, life, one, chapter, of, the, book, contains, a, systematic, refutation, of, alchemy, on, social, scientific, philosophical, and, religious, grounds, he, begins, his, refutation, on, social, grounds, arguing, that, many, alchemists, are, incapable, of, earning, a, living, and, end, up, losing, their, credibility, because, of, the, futility, of, their, attempts, and, states, that, if, transmutation, were, possible, the, disproportionate, growth, of, gold, and, silver, would, make, transactions, useless, and, would, run, counter, to, divine, wisdom, he, argues, that, some, alchemists, resort, to, fraud, either, openly, by, applying, a, thin, layer, of, gold, on, top, of, silver, jewelry, or, by, secretly, using, an, artificial, procedure, of, covering, whitened, copper, with, sublimated, mercury, ibn, khaldun, states, that, most, alchemists, are, honest, and, believe, that, the, transmutation, of, metals, is, possible, but, he, argues, that, transmutation, is, an, implausible, theory, since, there, has, been, no, successful, attempt, to, date, he, ends, his, arguments, with, a, restatement, of, his, position, alchemy, can, only, be, achieved, through, psychic, influences, bi, ta, thirat, al, nufus, extraordinary, things,

republicanism, of, the, aristotelian, proposition, that, man, is, political, by, nature, and, that, man, s, interdependence, creates, the, need, for, the, political, community, yet, he, argues, that, men, and, tribes, need, to, defend, themselves, from, potential, attacks, and, thus, political, communities, are, formed, the, glue, which, holds, such, tribes, together, and, eventually, forms, royal, authority, or, the, state, according, to, ibn, khaldun, is, asabiyyah, he, argues, that, the, best, type, of, political, community, is, a, caliphate, or, islamic, state, and, argues, that, the,

not, based, on, religious, law, and, so, not, beneficial, to, one, s, afterlife, ibn, khaldun, calls, this, state, blameworthy, yet, the, worst, type, of, state, according, to, ibn, khaldun, is, a, tyranny, wherein, government, usurps, property, rights, and, rules, with, injustice, against, the, rights, of, men, he, argues, that, if, that, is, not, possible, for, a, ruler, to, be, both, loved, and, feared, then, it, is, better, to, be, loved, because, fear, creates, many, negative, effects, in, the, state, s, population, ibn, khaldun, writes, that, civilizations, have, lifespans, like, individuals, and, that, every, state, will, eventually, fall, because, sedentary, luxuries, distract, them, and, eventually, government, begins, to, overtax, citizens, and, begin, injustice, against, property, rights, and, injustice, ruins, civilization, eventually, after, one, dynasty, or, royal, authority, falls, it, is, replaced, by, another, in, a, continuous, cycle, the, british, philosopher,
