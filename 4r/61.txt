a, museum, is, an, institution, dedicated, to, displaying, and, or, preserving, culturally, or, scientifically, significant, objects, many, museums, have, exhibitions, of, these, objects, on, public, display, and, some, have, private, collections, that, are, used, by, researchers, and, specialists, museums, host, a, much, wider, range, of, objects, than, a, library, and, usually, focus, on, a, specific, theme, such, as, the, arts, science, natural, history, or, local, history, public, museums, that, host, exhibitions, and, interactive, demonstrations, are, often, tourist, attractions, and, many, attract, large, numbers, of, visitors, from, outside, their, host, country, with, the, most, visited, museums, in, the, world, attracting, millions, of, visitors, annually, since, the, establishment, of, the, earliest, known, museum, in, ancient, times, museums, have, been, associated, with, academia, and, the, preservation, of, rare, items, museums, originated, as, private, collections, of, interesting, items, and, not, until, much, later, did, the, emphasis, on, educating, the, public, take, root, the, english, word, museum, comes, from, latin, and, is, pluralized, as, museums, or, rarely, musea, it, is, originally, from, the, ancient, greek, mouseion, which, denotes, a, place, or, temple, dedicated, to, the, muses, the, patron, divinities, in, greek, mythology, of, the, arts, and, hence, was, a, building, set, apart, for, study, and, the, arts, especially, the, musaeum, institute, for, philosophy, and, research, at, alexandria, built, under, ptolemy, i, soter, about, 280, bc, the, purpose, of, modern, museums, is, to, collect, preserve, interpret, and, display, objects, of, artistic, cultural, or, scientific, significance, for, the, study, and, education, of, the, public, to, city, leaders, an, active, museum, community, can, be, seen, as, a, gauge, of, the, cultural, or, economic, health, of, a, city, and, a, way, to, increase, the, sophistication, of, its, inhabitants, to, museum, professionals, a, museum, might, be, seen, as, a, way, to, educate, the, public, about, the, museum, s, mission, such, as, civil, rights, or, environmentalism, museums, are, above, all, storehouses, of, knowledge, in, 1829, james, smithson, s, bequest, funding, the, smithsonian, institution, stated, that, he, wanted, to, establish, an, institution, for, the, increase, and, diffusion, of, knowledge, in, the, late, 19th, century, museums, of, natural, history, exemplified, the, scientific, drive, for, classifying, life, and, interpreting, the, world, their, purpose, was, to, gather, examples, from, each, field, of, knowledge, for, research, and, display, concurrently, as, american, colleges, expanded, during, the, 19th, century, they, also, developed, their, own, natural, history, collections, to, support, the, education, of, their, students, by, the, last, quarter, of, the, 19th, century, scientific, research, in, universities, was, shifting, toward, biological, research, on, a, cellular, level, and, cutting, edge, research, moved, from, museums, to, university, laboratories, while, many, large, museums, such, as, the, smithsonian, institution, are, still, respected, as, research, centers, research, is, no, longer, a, main, purpose, of, most, museums, while, there, is, an, ongoing, debate, about, the, purposes, of, interpretation, of, a, museum, s, collection, there, has, been, a, consistent, mission, to, protect, and, preserve, cultural, artifacts, for, future, generations, much, care, expertise, and, expense, is, invested, in, preservation, efforts, to, retard, decomposition, in, ageing, documents, artifacts, artworks, and, buildings, all, museums, display, objects, that, are, important, to, a, culture, as, historian, steven, conn, writes, to, see, the, thing, itself, with, one, s, own, eyes, and, in, a, public, place, surrounded, by, other, people, having, some, version, of, the, same, experience, can, be, enchanting, museum, purposes, vary, from, institution, to, institution, some, favor, education, over, conservation, or, vice, versa, for, example, in, the, 1970s, the, canada, science, and, technology, museum, favored, education, over, the, preservation, of, their, objects, they, displayed, objects, as, well, as, their, functions, one, exhibit, featured, a, historical, printing, press, that, a, staff, member, used, for, visitors, to, create, museum, memorabilia, some, museums, seek, to, reach, a, wide, audience, such, as, a, national, or, state, museum, while, others, have, specific, audiences, like, the, lds, church, history, museum, or, local, history, organizations, generally, speaking, museums, collect, objects, of, significance, that, comply, with, their, mission, statement, for, conservation, and, display, apart, from, questions, of, provenance, and, conservation, museums, take, into, consideration, the, former, use, and, status, of, an, object, religious, or, holy, objects, for, instance, are, handled, according, to, cultural, rules, jewish, objects, that, contain, the, name, of, god, may, not, be, discarded, but, need, to, be, buried, although, most, museums, do, not, allow, physical, contact, with, the, associated, artifacts, there, are, some, that, are, interactive, and, encourage, a, more, hands, on, approach, in, 2009, hampton, court, palace, a, palace, of, henry, viii, in, england, opened, the, council, room, to, the, general, public, to, create, an, interactive, environment, for, visitors, rather, than, allowing, visitors, to, handle, 500, year, old, objects, however, the, museum, created, replicas, as, well, as, replica, costumes, the, daily, activities, historic, clothing, and, even, temperature, changes, immerse, the, visitor, in, an, impression, of, what, tudor, life, may, have, been, major, professional, organizations, from, around, the, world, offer, some, definitions, as, to, what, constitutes, a, museum, and, their, purpose, common, themes, in, all, the, definitions, are, public, good, and, the, care, preservation, and, interpretation, of, collections, the, international, council, of, museums, current, definition, of, a, museum, adopted, in, 2022, a, museum, is, a, not, for, profit, permanent, institution, in, the, service, of, society, that, researches, collects, conserves, interprets, and,

the, neo, babylonian, empire, the, site, dates, from, c, 530, bc, and, contained, artifacts, from, earlier, mesopotamian, civilizations, notably, a, clay, drum, label, written, in, three, languages, was, found, at, the, site, referencing, the, history, and, discovery, of, a, museum, item, ancient, greeks, and, romans, collected, and, displayed, art, and, objects, but, perceived, museums, differently, from, modern, day, views, in, the, classical, period, the, museums, were, the, temples, and, their, precincts, which, housed, collections, of, votive, offerings, paintings, and, sculptures, were, displayed, in, gardens, forums, theaters, and, bathhouses, in, the, ancient, past, there, was, little, differentiation, between, libraries, and, museums, with, both, occupying, the, building, and, were, frequently, connected, to, a, temple, or, royal, palace, the, museum, of, alexandria, is, believed, to, be, one, of, the, earliest, museums, in, the, world, while, it, connected, to, the, library, of, alexandria, it, is, not, clear, if, the, museum, was, in, a, different, building, from, the, library, or, was, part, of, the, library, complex, while, little, was, known, about, the, museum, it, was, an, inspiration, for, museums, during, the, early, renaissance, period, the, royal, palaces, also, functioned, as, a, kind, of, museum, outfitted, with, art, and, objects, from, conquered, territories, and, gifts, from, ambassadors, from, other, kingdoms, allowing, the, ruler, to, display, the, amassed, collections, to, guests, and, to, visiting, dignitaries, also, in, alexandria, from, the, time, of, ptolemy, ii, philadelphus, r, 285, 246, bce, was, the, first, zoological, park, at, first, used, by, philadelphus, in, an, attempt, to, domesticate, african, elephants, for, use, in, war, the, elephants, were, also, used, for, show, along, with, a, menagerie, of, other, animals, specimens, including, hartebeests, ostriches, zebras, leopards, giraffes, rhinoceros, and, pythons, early, museums, began, as, the, private, collections, of, wealthy, individuals, families, or, institutions, of, art, and, rare, or, curious, natural, objects, and, artifacts, these, were, often, displayed, in, so, called, wonder, rooms, or, cabinets, of, curiosities, these, contemporary, museums, first, emerged, in, western, europe, then, spread, into, other, parts, of, the, world, public, access, to, these, museums, was, often, possible, for, the, respectable, especially, to, private, art, collections, but, at, the, whim, of, the, owner, and, his, staff, one, way, that, elite, men, during, this, time, period, gained, a, higher, social, status, in, the, world, of, elites, was, by, becoming, a, collector, of, these, curious, objects, and, displaying, them, many, of, the, items, in, these, collections, were, new, discoveries, and, these, collectors, or, naturalists, since, many, of, these, people, held, interest, in, natural, sciences, were, eager, to, obtain, them, by, putting, their, collections, in, a, museum, and, on, display, they, not, only, got, to, show, their, fantastic, finds, but, also, used, the, museum, as, a, way, to, sort, and, manage, the, empirical, explosion, of, materials, that, wider, dissemination, of, ancient, texts, increased, travel, voyages, of, discovery, and, more, systematic, forms, of, communication, and, exchange, had, produced, one, of, these, naturalists, and, collectors, was, ulisse, aldrovandi, whose, collection, policy, of, gathering, as, many, objects, and, facts, about, them, was, encyclopedic, in, nature, reminiscent, of, that, of, pliny, the, roman, philosopher, and, naturalist, the, idea, was, to, consume, and, collect, as, much, knowledge, as, possible, to, put, everything, they, collected, and, everything, they, knew, in, these, displays, in, time, however, museum, philosophy, would, change, and, the, encyclopedic, nature, of, information, that, was, so, enjoyed, by, aldrovandi, and, his, cohorts, would, be, dismissed, as, well, as, the, museums, that, contained, this, knowledge, the, 18th, century, scholars, of, the, age, of, enlightenment, saw, their, ideas, of, the, museum, as, superior, and, based, their, natural, history, museums, on, organization, and, taxonomy, rather, than, displaying, everything, in, any, order, after, the, style, of, aldrovandi, the, first, public, museums, were, often, accessible, only, for, the, middle, and, upper, classes, it, could, be, difficult, to, gain, entrance, when, the, british, museum, opened, to, the, public, in, 1759, it, was, a, concern, that, large, crowds, could, damage, the, artifacts, prospective, visitors, to, the, british, museum, had, to, apply, in, writing, for, admission, and, small, groups, were, allowed, into, the, galleries, each, day, the, british, museum, became, increasingly, popular, during, the, 19th, century, amongst, all, age, groups, and, social, classes, who, visited, the, british, museum, especially, on, public, holidays, the, ashmolean, museum, however, founded, in, 1677, from, the, personal, collection, of, elias, ashmole, was, set, up, in, the, university, of, oxford, to, be, open, to, the, public, and, is, considered, by, some, to, be, the, first, modern, public, museum, the, collection, included, that, of, elias, ashmole, which, he, had, collected, himself, including, objects, he, had, acquired, from, the, gardeners, travellers, and, collectors, john, tradescant, the, elder, and, his, son, of, the, same, name, the, collection, included, antique, coins, books, engravings, geological, specimens, and, zoological, specimens, one, of, which, was, the, stuffed, body, of, the, last, dodo, ever, seen, in, europe, but, by, 1755, the, stuffed, dodo, was, so, moth, eaten, that, it, was, destroyed, except, for, its, head, and, one, claw, the, museum, opened, on, 24, may, 1683, with, naturalist, robert, plot, as, the, first, keeper, the, first, building, which, became, known, as, the, old, ashmolean, is, sometimes, attributed, to, sir, christopher, wren, or, thomas, wood, in, france, the, first, public, museum, was, the, louvre, in, paris, opened, in, 1793, during, the, french, revolution, which, enabled, for, the, first, time, free, access, to, the, former, french, royal, collections, for, people, of, all, stations, and, status, the, fabulous, art, treasures, collected, by, the, french, monarchy, over, centuries, were, accessible, to, the, public, three, days, each, d, cade, the, 10, day, unit, which, had, replaced, the, week, in, the, french, republican, calendar, the, conservatoire, du, mus, um, national, des, arts, national, museum, of, arts, s, conservatory, was, charged, with, organizing, the, louvre, as, a, national, public, museum, and, the, centerpiece, of, a, planned, national, museum, system, as, napol, on, i, conquered, the, great, cities, of, europe, confiscating, art, objects, as, he, went, the, collections, grew, and, the, organizational, task, became, more, and, more, complicated, after, napoleon, was, defeated, in, 1815, many, of, the, treasures, he, had, amassed, were, gradually, returned, to, their, owners, and, many, were, not, his, plan, was, never, fully, realized, but, his, concept, of, a, museum, as, an, agent, of, nationalistic, fervor, had, a, profound, influence, throughout, europe, chinese, and, japanese, visitors, to, europe, were, fascinated, by, the, museums, they, saw, there, but, had, cultural, difficulties, in, grasping, their, purpose, and, finding, an, equivalent, chinese, or, japanese, term, for, them, chinese, visitors, in, the, early, 19th, century, named, these, museums, based, on, what, they, contained, so, defined, them, as, bone, amassing, buildings, or, courtyards, of, treasures, or, painting, pavilions, or, curio, stores, or, halls, of, military, feats, or, gardens, of, everything, japan, first, encountered, western, museum, institutions, when, it, participated, in, europe, s, world, s, fairs, in, the, 1860s, the, british, museum, was, described, by, one, of, their, delegates, as, a, hakubutsukan, a, house, of, extensive, things, this, would, eventually, become, accepted, as, the, equivalent, word, for, museum, in, japan, and, china, american, museums, eventually, joined, european, museums, as, the, world, s, leading, centers, for, the, production, of, new, knowledge, in, their, fields, of, interest, a, period, of, intense, museum, building, in, both, an, intellectual, and, physical, sense, was, realized, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, this, is, often, called, the, museum, period, or, the, museum, age, while, many, american, museums, both, natural, history, museums, and, art, museums, alike, were, founded, with, the, intention, of, focusing, on, the, scientific, discoveries, and, artistic, developments, in, north, america, many, moved, to, emulate, their, european, counterparts, in, certain, ways, including, the, development, of, classical, collections, from, ancient, egypt, greece, mesopotamia, and, rome, drawing, on, michel, foucault, s, concept, of, liberal, government, tony, bennett, has, suggested, the, development, of, more, modern, 19th, century, museums, was, part, of, new, strategies, by, western, governments, to, produce, a, citizenry, that, rather, than, be, directed, by, coercive, or, external, forces, monitored, and, regulated, its, own, conduct, to, incorporate, the, masses, in, this, strategy, the, private, space, of, museums, that, previously, had, been, restricted, and, socially, exclusive, were, made, public, as, such, objects, and, artifacts, particularly, those, related, to, high, culture, became, instruments, for, these, new, tasks, of, social, management, universities, became, the, primary, centers, for, innovative, research, in, the, united, states, well, before, the, start, of, world, war, ii, nevertheless, museums, to, this, day, contribute, new, knowledge, to, their, fields, and, continue, to, build, collections, that, are, useful, for, both, research, and, display, the, late, twentieth, century, witnessed, intense, debate, concerning, the, repatriation, of, religious, ethnic, and, cultural, artifacts, housed, in, museum, collections, in, the, united, states, several, native, american, tribes, and, advocacy, groups, have, lobbied, extensively, for, the, repatriation, of, sacred, objects, and, the, reburial, of, human, remains, in, 1990, congress, passed, the, native, american, graves, protection, and, repatriation, act, nagpra, which, required, federal, agencies, and, federally, funded, institutions, to, repatriate, native, american, cultural, items, to, culturally, affiliate, tribes, and, groups, similarly, many, european, museum, collections, often, contain, objects, and, cultural, artifacts, acquired, through, imperialism, and, colonization, some, historians, and, scholars, have, criticized, the, british, museum, for, its, possession, of, rare, antiquities, from, egypt, greece, and, the, middle, east, the, roles, associated, with, the, management, of, a, museum, largely, depend, on, the, size, of, the, institution, together, the, board, and, the, director, establish, a, system, of, governance, that, is, guided, by, policies, that, set, standards, for, the, institution, documents, that, set, these, standards, include, an, institutional, or, strategic, plan, institutional, code, of, ethics, bylaws, and, collections, policy, the, american, alliance, of, museums, aam, has, also, formulated, a, series, of, standards, and, best, practices, that, help, guide, the, management, of, museums, various, positions, within, the, museum, carry, out, the, policies, established, by, the, board, and, the, director, all, museum, employees, should, work, together, toward, the, museum, s, institutional, goal, here, is, a, list, of, positions, commonly, found, at, museums, other, positions, commonly, found, at, museums, include, building, operator, public, programming, staff, photographer, librarian, archivist, groundskeeper, volunteer, coordinator, preparator, security, staff, development, officer, membership, officer, business, officer, gift, shop, manager, public, relations, staff, and, graphic, designer, at, smaller, museums, staff, members, often, fulfill, multiple, roles, some, of, these, positions, are, excluded, entirely, or, may, be, carried, out, by, a, contractor, when, necessary, the, cultural, property, stored, in, museums, is, threatened, in, many, countries, by, natural, disaster, war, terrorist, attacks, or, other, emergencies, to, this, end, an, internationally, important, aspect, is, a, strong, bundling, of, existing, resources, and, the, networking, of, existing, specialist, competencies, in, order, to, prevent, any, loss, or, damage, to, cultural, property, or, to, keep, damage, as, low, as, possible, international, partner, for, museums, is, unesco, and, blue, shield, international, in, accordance, with, the, hague, convention, for, the, protection, of, cultural, property, from, 1954, and, its, 2nd, protocol, from, 1999, for, legal, reasons, there, are, many, international, collaborations, between, museums, and, the, local, blue, shield, organizations, blue, shield, has, conducted, extensive, missions, to, protect, museums, and, cultural, assets, in, armed, conflict, such, as, 2011, in, egypt, and, libya, 2013, in, syria, and, 2014, in, mali, and, iraq, during, these, operations, the, looting, of, the, collection, is, to, be, prevented, in, particular, the, design, of, museums, has, evolved, throughout, history, however, museum, planning, involves, planning, the, actual, mission, of, the, museum, along, with, planning, the, space, that, the, collection, of, the, museum, will, be, housed, in, intentional, museum, planning, has, its, beginnings, with, the, museum, founder, and, librarian, john, cotton, dana, dana, detailed, the, process, of, founding, the, newark, museum, in, a, series, of, books, in, the, early, 20th, century, so, that, other, museum, founders, could, plan, their, museums, dana, suggested, that, potential, founders, of, museums, should, form, a, committee, first, and, reach, out, to, the, community, for, input, as, to, what, the, museum, should, supply, or, do, for, the, community, according, to, dana, museums, should, be, planned, according, to, community, s, needs, the, new, museum, does, not, build, on, an, educational, superstition, it, examines, its, community, s, life, first, and, then, straightway, bends, its, energies, to, supplying, some, the, material, which, that, community, needs, and, to, making, that, material, s, presence, widely, known, and, to, presenting, it, in, such, a, way, as, to, secure, it, for, the, maximum, of, use, and, the, maximum, efficiency, of, that, use, the, way, that, museums, are, planned, and, designed, vary, according, to, what, collections, they, house, but, overall, they, adhere, to, planning, a, space, that, is, easily, accessed, by, the, public, and, easily, displays, the, chosen, artifacts, these, elements, of, planning, have, their, roots, with, john, cotton, dana, who, was, perturbed, at, the, historical, placement, of, museums, outside, of, cities, and, in, areas, that, were, not, easily, accessed, by, the, public, in, gloomy, european, style, buildings, questions, of, accessibility, continue, to, the, present, day, many, museums, strive, to, make, their, buildings, programming, ideas, and, collections, more, publicly, accessible, than, in, the, past, not, every, museum, is, participating, in, this, trend, but, that, seems, to, be, the, trajectory, of, museums, in, the, twenty, first, century, with, its, emphasis, on, inclusiveness, one, pioneering, way, museums, are, attempting, to, make, their, collections, more, accessible, is, with, open, storage, most, of, a, museum, s, collection, is, typically, locked, away, in, a, secure, location, to, be, preserved, but, the, result, is, most, people, never, get, to, see, the, vast, majority, of, collections, the, brooklyn, museum, s, luce, center, for, american, art, practices, this, open, storage, where, the, public, can, view, items, not, on, display, albeit, with, minimal, interpretation, the, practice, of, open, storage, is, all, part, of, an, ongoing, debate, in, the, museum, field, of, the, role, objects, play, and, how, accessible, they, should, be, in, terms, of, modern, museums, interpretive, museums, as, opposed, to, art, museums, have, missions, reflecting, curatorial, guidance, through, the, subject, matter, which, now, include, content, in, the, form, of, images, audio, and, visual, effects, and, interactive, exhibits, museum, creation, begins, with, a, museum, plan, created, through, a, museum, planning, process, the, process, involves, identifying, the, museum, s, vision, and, the, resources, organization, and, experiences, needed, to, realize, this, vision, a, feasibility, study, analysis, of, comparable, facilities, and, an, interpretive, plan, are, all, developed, as, part, of, the, museum, planning, process, some, museum, experiences, have, very, few, or, no, artifacts, and, do, not, necessarily, call, themselves, museums, and, their, mission, reflects, this, the, griffith, observatory, in, los, angeles, and, the, national, constitution, center, in, philadelphia, being, notable, examples, where, there, are, few, artifacts, but, strong, memorable, stories, are, told, or, information, is, interpreted, in, contrast, the, united, states, holocaust, memorial, museum, in, washington, d, c, uses, many, artifacts, in, their, memorable, exhibitions, museums, are, laid, out, in, a, specific, way, for, a, specific, reason, and, each, person, who, enters, the, doors, of, a, museum, will, see, its, collection, completely, differently, to, the, person, behind, them, this, is, what, makes, museums, fascinating, because, they, are, represented, differently, to, each, individual, 9, 10, in, recent, years, some, cities, have, turned, to, museums, as, an, avenue, for, economic, development, or, rejuvenation, this, is, particularly, true, in, the, case, of, postindustrial, cities, examples, of, museums, fulfilling, these, economic, roles, exist, around, the, world, for, example, the, guggenheim, museum, bilbao, was, built, in, bilbao, spain, in, a, move, by, the, basque, regional, government, to, revitalize, the, dilapidated, old, port, area, of, that, city, the, basque, government, agreed, to, pay, 100, million, for, the, construction, of, the, museum, a, price, tag, that, caused, many, bilbaoans, to, protest, against, the, project, nonetheless, over, 1, 1, million, people, visited, the, museum, in, 2015, indicating, it, appeared, to, have, paid, off, for, the, local, government, despite, local, backlash, key, to, this, is, the, large, demographic, of, foreign, visitors, to, the, museum, with, 63, of, the, visitors, residing, outside, of, spain, and, thus, feeding, foreign, investment, straight, into, bilbao, a, similar, project, to, that, undertaken, in, bilbao, was, the, titanic, belfast, built, on, disused, shipyards, in, belfast, northern, ireland, incidentally, for, the, same, price, as, the, guggenheim, museum, bilbao, and, by, the, same, architect, frank, gehry, in, time, for, the, 100th, anniversary, of, titanic, s, maiden, voyage, in, 2012, initially, expecting, modest, visitor, numbers, of, 425, 000, annually, first, year, visitor, numbers, reached, over, 800, 000, with, almost, 60, coming, from, outside, northern, ireland, in, the, united, states, similar, projects, include, the, 81, 000, square, foot, taubman, museum, of, art, in, roanoke, virginia, and, the, broad, in, los, angeles, museums, being, used, as, a, cultural, economic, driver, by, city, and, local, governments, has, proven, to, be, controversial, among, museum, activists, and, local, populations, alike, public, protests, have, occurred, in, numerous, cities, which, have, tried, to, employ, museums, in, this, way, while, most, subside, if, a, museum, is, successful, as, happened, in, bilbao, others, continue, especially, if, a, museum, struggles, to, attract, visitors, the, taubman, museum, of, art, is, an, example, of, an, expensive, museum, eventually, 66, million, that, attained, little, success, and, continues, to, have, a, low, endowment, for, its, size, some, museum, activists, see, this, method, of, museum, use, as, a, deeply, flawed, model, for, such, institutions, steven, conn, one, such, museum, proponent, believes, that, to, ask, museums, to, solve, our, political, and, economic, problems, is, to, set, them, up, for, inevitable, failure, and, to, set, us, the, visitor, up, for, inevitable, disappointment, museums, are, facing, funding, shortages, funding, for, museums, comes, from, four, major, categories, and, as, of, 2009, the, breakdown, for, the, united, states, is, as, follows, government, support, at, all, levels, 24, 4, private, charitable, giving, 36, 5, earned, income, 27, 6, and, investment, income, 11, 5, government, funding, from, the, national, endowment, for, the, arts, the, largest, museum, funder, in, the, united, states, decreased, by, 19, 586, million, between, 2011, and, 2015, adjusted, for, inflation, the, average, spent, per, visitor, in, an, art, museum, in, 2016, was, 8, between, admissions, store, and, restaurant, where, the, average, expense, per, visitor, was, 55, corporations, which, fall, into, the, private, giving, category, can, be, a, good, source, of, funding, to, make, up, the, funding, gap, the, amount, corporations, currently, give, to, museums, accounts, for, just, 5, of, total, funding, corporate, giving, to, the, arts, however, was, set, to, increase, by, 3, 3, in, 2017, most, mid, size, and, large, museums, employ, exhibit, design, staff, for, graphic, and, environmental, design, projects, including, exhibitions, in, addition, to, traditional, 2, d, and, 3, d, designers, and, architects, these, staff, departments, may, include, audio, visual, specialists, software, designers, audience, research, evaluation, specialists, writers, editors, and, preparators, or, art, handlers, these, staff, specialists, may, also, be, charged, with, supervising, contract, design, or, production, services, the, exhibit, design, process, builds, on, the, interpretive, plan, for, an, exhibit, determining, the, most, effective, engaging, and, appropriate, methods, of, communicating, a, message, or, telling, a, story, the, process, will, often, mirror, the, architectural, process, or, schedule, moving, from, conceptual, plan, through, schematic, design, design, development, contract, document, fabrication, and, installation, museums, of, all, sizes, may, also, contract, the, outside, services, of, exhibit, fabrication, businesses, some, museum, scholars, have, even, begun, to, question, whether, museums, truly, need, artifacts, at, all, historian, steven, conn, provocatively, asks, this, question, suggesting, that, there, are, fewer, objects, in, all, museums, now, as, they, have, been, progressively, replaced, by, interactive, technology, as, educational, programming, has, grown, in, museums, mass, collections, of, objects, have, receded, in, importance, this, is, not, necessarily, a, negative, development, dorothy, canfield, fisher, observed, that, the, reduction, in, objects, has, pushed, museums, to, grow, from, institutions, that, artlessly, showcased, their, many, artifacts, in, the, style, of, early, cabinets, of, curiosity, to, instead, thinning, out, the, objects, presented, for, a, general, view, of, any, given, subject, or, period, and, to, put, the, rest, away, in, archive, storage, rooms, where, they, could, be, consulted, by, students, the, only, people, who, really, needed, to, see, them, this, phenomenon, of, disappearing, objects, is, especially, present, in, science, museums, like, the, museum, of, science, and, industry, in, chicago, which, have, a, high, visitorship, of, school, aged, children, who, may, benefit, more, from, hands, on, interactive, technology, than, reading, a, label, beside, an, artifact, there, is, no, definitive, standard, as, to, the, set, types, of, museums, additionally, the, museum, landscape, has, become, so, varied, that, it, may, not, be, sufficient, to, use, traditional, categories, to, comprehend, fully, the, vast, variety, existing, throughout, the, world, however, it, may, be, useful, to, categorize, museums, in, different, ways, under, multiple, perspectives, museums, can, vary, based, on, size, from, large, institutions, to, very, small, institutions, focusing, on, specific, subjects, such, as, a, specific, location, a, notable, person, or, a, given, period, of, time, museums, also, can, be, based, on, the, main, source, of, funding, central, or, federal, government, provinces, regions, universities, towns, and, communities, other, subsidised, nonsubsidised, and, private, it, may, sometimes, be, useful, to, distinguish, between, diachronic, museums, which, interpret, the, way, its, subject, matter, has, developed, and, evolved, through, time, e, g, lower, east, side, tenement, museum, and, diachronic, museum, of, larissa, and, synchronic, museums, which, interpret, the, way, its, subject, matter, existed, at, a, certain, point, in, time, e, g, the, anne, frank, house, and, colonial, williamsburg, according, to, university, of, florida, professor, eric, kilgerman, while, a, museum, in, which, a, particular, narrative, unfolds, within, its, halls, is, diachronic, those, museums, that, limit, their, space, to, a, single, experience, are, called, synchronic, in, her, book, civilizing, the, museum, author, elaine, heumann, gurian, proposes, that, there, are, five, categories, of, museums, based, on, intention, and, not, content, object, centered, narrative, client, centered, community, centered, and, national, museums, can, also, be, categorized, into, major, groups, by, the, type, of, collections, they, display, to, include, fine, arts, applied, arts, craft, archaeology, anthropology, and, ethnology, biography, history, cultural, history, science, technology, children, s, museums, natural, history, botanical, and, zoological, gardens, within, these, categories, many, museums, specialize, further, e, g, museums, of, modern, art, folk, art, local, history, military, history, aviation, history, philately, agriculture, or, geology, the, size, of, a, museum, s, collection, typically, determines, the, museum, s, size, whereas, its, collection, reflects, the, type, of, museum, it, is, many, museums, normally, display, a, permanent, collection, of, important, selected, objects, in, its, area, of, specialization, and, may, periodically, display, special, collections, on, a, temporary, basis, the, following, is, a, list, to, give, an, idea, of, the, major, museum, types, while, comprehensive, it, is, not, a, definitive, list, private, museums, are, organized, by, individuals, and, managed, by, a, board, and, museum, officers, but, public, museums, are, created, and, managed, by, federal, state, or, local, governments, a, government, can, charter, a, museum, through, legislative, action, but, the, museum, can, still, be, private, as, it, is, not, part, of, the, government, the, distinction, regulates, the, ownership, and, legal, accountability, for, the, care, of, the, collections, nonprofit, means, that, an, organization, is, classified, as, a, charitable, corporation, and, is, exempt, from, paying, most, taxes, and, the, money, the, organization, earns, is, invested, in, the, organization, itself, money, made, by, a, private, for, profit, museum, is, paid, to, the, museum, s, owners, or, shareholders, the, nonprofit, museum, has, a, fiduciary, responsibility, in, regards, to, the, public, in, essence, the, museum, holds, its, collections, and, administers, it, for, the, benefit, of, the, public, collections, of, for, profit, museums, are, legally, corporate, assets, the, museum, administers, for, the, benefit, of, the, owners, or, shareholders, a, trust, is, a, legal, instrument, where, trustees, manage, the, trust, s, assets, for, the, benefit, of, the, museum, following, the, specific, wishes, of, the, donor, this, provides, tax, benefits, for, the, donor, and, also, allows, the, donor, to, have, control, over, how, assets, are, distributed, corporations, are, legal, entities, and, may, acquire, property, in, a, way, similar, to, how, an, individual, can, own, property, museums, under, incorporation, are, usually, organized, by, a, community, or, group, of, individuals, while, a, board, of, director, s, loyalty, is, to, the, corporation, a, board, of, trustee, s, loyalty, has, to, be, loyal, to, the, intention, of, the, trust, the, ramification, is, that, a, trust, is, far, less, flexible, than, a, corporation, a, global, movement, for, the, decolonization, of, museums, has, been, gaining, momentum, since, the, late, 20th, century, proponents, of, this, movement, argue, that, museums, are, a, box, of, things, and, do, not, represent, complete, stories, instead, they, show, biased, narratives, based, on, ideologies, in, which, certain, stories, are, intentionally, disregarded, 9, 18, through, this, people, are, encouraging, others, to, consider, this, missing, perspective, when, looking, at, museum, collections, as, every, object, viewed, in, such, environments, was, placed, by, an, individual, to, represent, a, certain, viewpoint, be, it, historical, or, cultural, 9, 18, the, 2018, report, on, the, restitution, of, african, cultural, heritage, is, a, prominent, example, regarding, the, decolonization, of, museums, and, other, collections, in, france, and, the, claims, of, african, countries, to, regain, artifacts, illegally, taken, from, their, original, cultural, settings, since, 1868, several, monolithic, human, figures, known, as, moai, have, been, removed, from, easter, island, and, put, in, display, in, major, western, museums, such, as, the, national, museum, of, natural, history, the, british, museum, the, louvre, and, the, royal, museums, of, art, and, history, several, demands, have, been, made, by, easter, island, residents, for, the, return, of, the, moai, the, figures, are, seen, as, ancestors, and, family, or, the, soul, by, the, rapa, nui, and, hold, deep, cultural, value, to, their, people, other, examples, include, the, gweagal, shield, thought, to, be, a, very, significant, shield, taken, from, botany, bay, in, april, 1770, or, the, parthenon, marble, sculptures, which, were, taken, from, greece, by, lord, elgin, in, 1805, successive, greek, governments, have, unsuccessfully, petitioned, for, the, return, of, the, parthenon, marbles, another, example, among, many, others, is, the, so, called, montezuma, s, headdress, in, the, museum, of, ethnology, vienna, which, is, a, source, of, dispute, between, austria, and, mexico, the, past, few, years, has, seen, a, unionizing, movement, us, museums, workers, have, initiated, dialogs, about, labor, and, collective, organizing, in, the, cultural, sector, in, 2019, the, workers, in, multiple, museums, voted, to, form, unions, with, more, protesting, to, press, for, a, fair, contract, and, against, unfair, labor, practices, during, that, year, over, 3, 000, cultural, workers, anonymously, started, to, share, their, salaries, online, through, a, pay, transparency, spreadsheet, the, marciano, art, foundation, a, museum, established, by, co, founders, of, guess, clothing, maurice, marciano, and, paul, marciano, closed, indefinitely, in, november, 2019, after, workers, attempted, to, unionize, the, marciano, foundation, released, a, statement, a, month, later, that, the, closure, was, permanent, in, the, country, of, georgia, 40, employees, were, fired, may, 2022, as, part, of, a, restructuring, the, newly, formed, union, the, georgian, trade, union, of, science, education, and, culture, workers, said, in, a, statement, they, said, the, employees, were, fired, illegally, and, the, reorganization, was, carried, out, by, the, employer, in, an, untransparent, and, maladministered, manner, and, that, the, organization, will, definitely, fight, to, the, end, to, protect, the, rights, of, employees, fired, senior, curator, maia, pataridze, said, the, new, management, mentioned, her, social, media, posts, criticizing, the, government, among, those, fired, was, union, chair, nikoloz, tsikaridze, a, senior, researcher, and, archaeologist, who, associated, the, discharging, of, himself, and, other, museum, staff, was, for, forming, a, union, and, said, that, thea, tsulukiani, the, georgia, minister, of, culture, had, punished, them, in, the, united, states, labor, unrest, within, the, arts, and, cultural, sector, go, back, at, least, nearly, a, century, to, 1933, when, a, new, york, based, collective, of, artists, eventually, known, as, the, artist, s, union, used, collective, bargaining, for, state, relief, for, unemployed, artists, in, 1971, administrative, staff, at, new, york, s, museum, of, modern, art, formed, the, organization, professional, and, staff, association, of, the, museum, of, modern, art, pasta, the, first, union, of, professional, employees, as, opposed, to, maintenance, and, service, people, at, a, privately, financed, museum, the, contract, negotiated, would, provide, a, wage, increase, protection, against, termination, without, cause, and, direct, access, to, trustees, and, policy, making, processes, at, the, museum, while, there, was, some, interest, from, workers, at, other, museums, at, the, time, for, the, next, fifty, years, there, was, little, change, in, museums, adding, union, representation, of, their, professional, employees, increasingly, museums, have, responded, to, the, ongoing, climate, crisis, through, enacting, sustainable, museum, practices, and, exhibitions, highlighting, the, issues, surrounding, climate, change, and, the, anthropocene, as, digital, culture, has, increased, in, society, museums, have, needed, to, respond, to, these, changes, in, the, facilities, that, they, offer, online, as, well, as, an, argument, for, the, decolonization, of, museums, there, is, also, the, push, by, some, to, represent, in, both, exhibitions, and, new, museums, the, marginalized, communities, within, a, culture, or, society, one, example, of, this, is, the, work, of, archivist, and, diverse, heritage, specialist, norma, gregory, in, nottingham, england, gregory, has, set, up, the, black, miner, s, museum, and, has, curated, an, exhibition, entitled, the, digging, deep, project, exhibition
