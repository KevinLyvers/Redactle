postmodern, architecture, is, a, style, or, movement, which, emerged, in, the, late, 1950s, as, a, reaction, against, the, austerity, formality, and, lack, of, variety, of, modern, architecture, particularly, in, the, international, style, advocated, by, philip, johnson, and, henry, russell, hitchcock, the, movement, was, introduced, by, the, architect, and, urban, planner, denise, scott, brown, and, architectural, theorist, robert, venturi, in, their, 1972, book, learning, from, las, vegas, the, style, flourished, from, the, 1980s, through, the, 1990s, particularly, in, the, work, of, scott, brown, venturi, philip, johnson, charles, moore, and, michael, graves, in, the, late, 1990s, it, divided, into, a, multitude, of, new, tendencies, including, high, tech, architecture, neo, futurism, new, classical, architecture, and, deconstructivism, however, some, buildings, built, after, this, period, are, still, considered, postmodern, postmodern, architecture, emerged, in, the, late, 1950s, as, a, reaction, against, the, perceived, shortcomings, of, modern, architecture, particularly, its, rigid, doctrines, its, uniformity, its, lack, of, ornament, and, its, habit, of, ignoring, the, history, and, culture, of, the, cities, where, it, appeared, in, 1966, venturi, formalized, the, movement, in, his, book, complexity, and, contradiction, in, architecture, venturi, summarized, the, kind, of, architecture, he, wanted, to, see, replace, modernism, i, speak, of, a, complex, and, contradictory, architecture, based, on, the, richness, and, ambiguity, of, modern, experience, including, that, experience, which, is, inherent, in, art, i, welcome, the, problems, and, exploit, the, uncertainties, i, like, elements, which, are, hybrid, rather, than, pure, compromising, rather, than, clean, accommodating, rather, than, excluding, i, am, for, messy, vitality, over, obvious, unity, i, prefer, both, and, to, either, or, black, and, white, and, sometimes, gray, to, black, or, white, an, architecture, of, complexity, and, contradiction, must, embody, the, difficult, unity, of, inclusion, rather, than, the, easy, unity, of, exclusion, in, place, of, the, functional, doctrines, of, modernism, venturi, proposed, giving, primary, emphasis, to, the, fa, ade, incorporating, historical, elements, a, subtle, use, of, unusual, materials, and, historical, allusions, and, the, use, of, fragmentation, and, modulations, to, make, the, building, interesting, accomplished, architect, and, urban, planner, denise, scott, brown, who, was, venturi, s, wife, and, venturi, wrote, learning, from, las, vegas, 1972, co, authored, with, steven, izenour, in, which, they, further, developed, their, joint, argument, against, modernism, they, urged, architects, to, take, into, consideration, and, to, celebrate, the, existing, architecture, in, a, place, rather, than, to, try, to, impose, a, visionary, utopia, from, their, own, fantasies, this, was, in, line, with, scott, brown, s, belief, that, buildings, should, be, built, for, people, and, that, architecture, should, listen, to, them, scott, brown, and, venturi, argued, that, ornamental, and, decorative, elements, accommodate, existing, needs, for, variety, and, communication, the, book, was, instrumental, in, opening, readers, eyes, to, new, ways, of, thinking, about, buildings, as, it, drew, from, the, entire, history, of, architecture, both, high, style, and, vernacular, both, historic, and, modern, and, in, response, to, mies, van, der, rohe, s, famous, maxim, less, is, more, venturi, responded, to, less, is, a, bore, venturi, cited, the, example, of, one, of, his, wife, s, and, his, own, buildings, guild, house, in, philadelphia, as, examples, of, a, new, style, that, welcomed, variety, and, historical, references, without, returning, to, academic, revival, of, old, styles, in, italy, at, about, the, same, time, a, similar, revolt, against, strict, modernism, was, being, launched, by, the, architect, aldo, rossi, who, criticized, the, rebuilding, of, italian, cities, and, buildings, destroyed, during, the, war, in, the, modernist, style, which, had, had, no, relation, to, the, architectural, history, original, street, plans, or, culture, of, the, cities, rossi, insisted, that, cities, be, rebuilt, in, ways, that, preserved, their, historical, fabric, and, local, traditions, similar, ideas, were, and, projects, were, put, forward, at, the, venice, biennale, in, 1980, the, call, for, a, post, modern, style, was, joined, by, christian, de, portzamparc, in, france, and, ricardo, bofill, in, spain, and, in, japan, by, arata, isozaki, robert, venturi, 1925, 2018, was, both, a, prominent, theorist, of, postmodernism, and, an, architect, whose, buildings, illustrated, his, ideas, after, studying, at, the, american, academy, in, rome, he, worked, in, the, offices, of, the, modernists, eero, saarinen, and, louis, kahn, until, 1958, and, then, became, a, professor, of, architecture, at, yale, university, one, of, his, first, buildings, was, the, guild, house, in, philadelphia, built, between, 1960, and, 1963, and, a, house, for, his, mother, in, chestnut, hill, in, philadelphia, these, two, houses, became, symbols, of, the, postmodern, movement, he, went, on, to, design, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, a, series, of, buildings, which, took, into, account, both, historic, precedents, and, the, ideas, and, forms, existing, in, the, real, life, of, the, cities, around, them, michael, graves, 1934, 2015, designed, two, of, the, most, prominent, buildings, in, the, postmodern, style, the, portland, building, and, the, denver, public, library, he, later, followed, up, his, landmark, buildings, by, designing, large, low, cost, retail, stores, for, chains, such, as, target, and, j, c, penney, in, the, united, states, which, had, a, major, influence, on, the, design, of, retail, stores, in, city, centers, and, shopping, malls, in, his, early, career, he, along, with, the, peter, eisenman, charles, gwathmey, john, hejduk, and, richard, meier, was, considered, one, of, the, new, york, five, a, group, of, advocates, of, pure, modern, architecture, but, in, 1982, he, turned, toward, postmodernism, with, the, portland, building, one, of, the, first, major, structures, in, the, style, the, building, has, since, been, added, to, the, national, register, of, historic, places, the, most, famous, work, of, architect, charles, moore, 1925, 1993, is, the, piazza, d, italia, in, new, orleans, 1978, a, public, square,

mies, on, another, iconic, modernist, project, the, seagrams, building, in, new, york, city, however, in, the, 1950s, he, began, to, include, certain, playful, and, mannerist, forms, into, his, buildings, such, as, the, synagogue, of, port, chester, 1954, 1956, with, a, vaulted, plaster, ceiling, and, narrow, colored, windows, and, the, art, gallery, of, the, university, of, nebraska, 1963,

and, personality, colored, glass, is, sometimes, used, or, ceramic, tiles, or, stone, the, buildings, of, mexican, architect, luis, barrag, n, offer, bright, sunlight, color, that, give, life, to, the, forms, humor, is, a, particular, feature, of, many, postmodern, buildings, particularly, in, the, united, states, an, example, is, the, binoculars, building, in, the, venice, neighborhood, of, los, angeles, designed, by, frank, gehry, in, collaboration, with, the, sculptor, claes, oldenburg, 1991, 2001, the, gateway, of, the, building, is, in, the, form, of, an, enormous, pair, of, binoculars, cars, enter, the, garage, passing, under, the, binoculars, camp, humor, was, popular, during, the, postmodern, period, it, was, an, ironic, humor, based, on, the, premise, that, something, could, appear, so, bad, such, as, a, building, that, appeared, about, to, collapse, that, it, was, good, in, 1964, american, critic, susan, sontag, defined, camp, as, a, style, which, put, its, accent, on, the, texture, the, surface, and, style, to, the, detriment, of, the, content, which, adored, exaggeration, and, things, which, were, not, what, they, seemed, postmodern, architecture, sometimes, used, the, same, sense, of, theatricality, sense, of, the, absurd, and, exaggeration, of, forms, the, aims, of, postmodernism, which, include, solving, the, problems, of, modernism, communicating, meanings, with, ambiguity, and, sensitivity, for, the, building, s, context, are, surprisingly, unified, for, a, period, of, buildings, designed, by, architects, who, largely, never, collaborated, with, each, other, these, aims, do, however, leave, room, for, diverse, implementations, as, can, be, illustrated, by, the, variety, of, buildings, created, during, the, movement, the, characteristics, of, postmodernism, allow, its, aim, to, be, expressed, in, diverse, ways, these, characteristics, include, the, use, of, sculptural, forms, ornaments, anthropomorphism, and, materials, which, perform, trompe, l, il, these, physical, characteristics, are, combined, with, conceptual, characteristics, of, meaning, these, characteristics, of, meaning, include, pluralism, double, coding, flying, buttresses, and, high, ceilings, irony, and, paradox, and, contextualism, the, sculptural, forms, not, necessarily, organic, were, created, with, much, ardor, these, can, be, seen, in, hans, hollein, s, abteiberg, museum, 1972, 1982, the, building, is, made, up, of, several, building, units, all, very, different, each, building, s, forms, are, nothing, like, the, conforming, rigid, ones, of, modernism, these, forms, are, sculptural, and, are, somewhat, playful, these, forms, are, not, reduced, to, an, absolute, minimum, they, are, built, and, shaped, for, their, own, sake, the, building, units, all, fit, together, in, a, very, organic, way, which, enhances, the, effect, of, the, forms, after, many, years, of, neglect, ornament, returned, frank, gehry, s, venice, beach, house, built, in, 1986, is, littered, with, small, ornamental, details, that, would, have, been, considered, excessive, and, needless, in, modernism, the, venice, beach, house, has, an, assembly, of, circular, logs, which, exist, mostly, for, decoration, the, logs, on, top, do, have, a, minor, purpose, of, holding, up, the, window, covers, however, the, mere, fact, that, they, could, have, been, replaced, with, a, practically, invisible, nail, makes, their, exaggerated, existence, largely, ornamental, the, ornament, in, michael, graves, portland, municipal, services, building, portland, building, 1980, is, even, more, prominent, the, two, obtruding, triangular, forms, are, largely, ornamental, they, exist, for, aesthetic, or, their, own, purpose, postmodernism, with, its, sensitivity, to, the, building, s, context, did, not, exclude, the, needs, of, humans, from, the, building, carlo, scarpa, s, brion, cemetery, 1970, 1972, exemplifies, this, the, human, requirements, of, a, cemetery, is, that, it, possesses, a, solemn, nature, yet, it, must, not, cause, the, visitor, to, become, depressed, scarpa, s, cemetery, achieves, the, solemn, mood, with, the, dull, gray, colors, of, the, walls, and, neatly, defined, forms, but, the, bright, green, grass, prevents, this, from, being, too, overwhelming, postmodern, buildings, sometimes, utilize, trompe, l, il, creating, the, illusion, of, space, or, depths, where, none, actually, exist, as, has, been, done, by, painters, since, the, romans, the, portland, building, 1980, has, pillars, represented, on, the, side, of, the, building, that, to, some, extent, appear, to, be, real, yet, they, are, not, the, hood, museum, of, art, 1981, 1983, has, a, typical, asymmetrical, fa, ade, which, was, at, the, time, prevalent, throughout, postmodern, buildings, robert, venturi, s, vanna, venturi, house, 1962, 1964, illustrates, the, postmodernist, aim, of, communicating, a, meaning, and, the, characteristic, of, symbolism, the, fa, ade, is, according, to, venturi, a, symbolic, picture, of, a, house, looking, back, to, the, 18th, century, this, is, partly, achieved, through, the, use, of, symmetry, and, the, arch, over, the, entrance, perhaps, the, best, example, of, irony, in, postmodern, buildings, is, charles, moore, s, piazza, d, italia, 1978, moore, quotes, architecturally, elements, of, italian, renaissance, and, roman, antiquity, however, he, does, so, with, a, twist, the, irony, comes, when, it, is, noted, that, the, pillars, are, covered, with, steel, it, is, also, paradoxical, in, the, way, he, quotes, italian, antiquity, far, away, from, the, original, in, new, orleans, double, coding, meant, the, buildings, convey, many, meanings, simultaneously, the, sony, building, in, new, york, provides, one, example, the, building, is, a, tall, skyscraper, which, brings, with, it, connotations, of, very, modern, technology, however, the, top, contradicts, this, the, top, section, conveys, elements, of, classical, antiquity, this, double, coding, is, a, prevalent, trait, of, postmodernism, the, characteristics, of, postmodernism, were, rather, unified, given, their, diverse, appearances, the, most, notable, among, their, characteristics, is, their, playfully, extravagant, forms, and, the, humour, of, the, meanings, the, buildings, conveyed, postmodern, architecture, as, an, international, style, the, first, examples, of, which, are, generally, cited, as, being, from, the, 1950s, but, did, not, become, a, movement, until, the, late, 1970s, and, continues, to, influence, present, day, architecture, postmodernity, in, architecture, is, said, to, be, heralded, by, the, return, of, wit, ornament, and, reference, to, architecture, in, response, to, the, formalism, of, the, international, style, of, modernism, as, with, many, cultural, movements, some, of, postmodernism, s, most, pronounced, and, visible, ideas, can, be, seen, in, architecture, the, functional, and, formalized, shapes, and, spaces, of, the, modernist, style, are, replaced, by, diverse, aesthetics, styles, collide, form, is, adopted, for, its, own, sake, and, new, ways, of, viewing, familiar, styles, and, space, abound, perhaps, most, obviously, architects, rediscovered, past, architectural, ornament, and, forms, which, had, been, abstracted, by, the, modernist, architects, postmodern, architecture, has, also, been, described, as, neo, eclectic, where, reference, and, ornament, have, returned, to, the, fa, ade, replacing, the, aggressively, unornamented, modern, styles, this, eclecticism, is, often, combined, with, the, use, of, non, orthogonal, angles, and, unusual, surfaces, most, famously, in, the, state, gallery, of, stuttgart, by, james, stirling, and, the, piazza, d, italia, by, charles, moore, the, scottish, parliament, building, in, edinburgh, has, also, been, cited, as, being, of, postmodern, vogue, modernist, architects, may, regard, postmodern, buildings, as, vulgar, associated, with, a, populist, ethic, and, sharing, the, design, elements, of, shopping, malls, cluttered, with, gew, gaws, postmodern, architects, may, regard, many, modern, buildings, as, soulless, and, bland, overly, simplistic, and, abstract, this, contrast, was, exemplified, in, the, juxtaposition, of, the, whites, against, the, grays, in, which, the, whites, were, seeking, to, continue, or, revive, the, modernist, tradition, of, purism, and, clarity, while, the, grays, were, embracing, a, more, multifaceted, cultural, vision, seen, in, robert, venturi, s, statement, rejecting, the, black, or, white, world, view, of, modernism, in, favor, of, black, and, white, and, sometimes, gray, the, divergence, in, opinions, comes, down, to, a, difference, in, goals, modernism, is, rooted, in, minimal, and, true, use, of, material, as, well, as, absence, of, ornament, while, postmodernism, is, a, rejection, of, strict, rules, set, by, the, early, modernists, and, seeks, meaning, and, expression, in, the, use, of, building, techniques, forms, and, stylistic, references, one, building, form, that, typifies, the, explorations, of, postmodernism, is, the, traditional, gable, roof, in, place, of, the, iconic, flat, roof, of, modernism, shedding, water, away, from, the, center, of, the, building, such, a, roof, form, always, served, a, functional, purpose, in, climates, with, rain, and, snow, and, was, a, logical, way, to, achieve, larger, spans, with, shorter, structural, members, but, it, was, nevertheless, relatively, rare, in, modernist, buildings, however, postmodernism, s, own, modernist, roots, appear, in, some, of, the, noteworthy, examples, of, reclaimed, roofs, for, instance, robert, venturi, s, vanna, venturi, house, breaks, the, gable, in, the, middle, denying, the, functionality, of, the, form, and, philip, johnson, s, 1001, fifth, avenue, building, in, manhattan, advertises, a, mansard, roof, form, as, an, obviously, flat, false, front, another, alternative, to, the, flat, roofs, of, modernism, would, exaggerate, a, traditional, roof, to, call, even, more, attention, to, it, as, when, kallmann, mckinnell, wood, s, american, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, in, cambridge, massachusetts, layers, three, tiers, of, low, hipped, roof, forms, one, above, another, for, an, emphatic, statement, of, shelter, a, new, trend, became, evident, in, the, last, quarter, of, the, 20th, century, as, some, architects, started, to, turn, away, from, modern, functionalism, which, they, viewed, as, boring, and, which, some, of, the, public, considered, unwelcoming, and, even, unpleasant, these, architects, turned, toward, the, past, quoting, past, aspects, of, various, buildings, and, melding, them, together, even, sometimes, in, an, inharmonious, manner, to, create, a, new, means, of, designing, buildings, a, vivid, example, of, this, new, approach, was, that, postmodernism, saw, the, comeback, of, columns, and, other, elements, of, premodern, designs, sometimes, adapting, classical, greek, and, roman, examples, in, modernism, the, traditional, column, as, a, design, feature, was, treated, as, a, cylindrical, pipe, form, replaced, by, other, technological, means, such, as, cantilevers, or, masked, completely, by, curtain, wall, fa, ades, the, revival, of, the, column, was, an, aesthetic, rather, than, a, technological, necessity, modernist, high, rise, buildings, had, become, in, most, instances, monolithic, rejecting, the, concept, of, a, stack, of, varied, design, elements, for, a, single, vocabulary, from, ground, level, to, the, top, in, the, most, extreme, cases, even, using, a, constant, footprint, with, no, tapering, or, wedding, cake, design, with, the, building, sometimes, even, suggesting, the, possibility, of, a, single, metallic, extrusion, directly, from, the, ground, mostly, by, eliminating, visual, horizontal, elements, this, was, seen, most, strictly, in, minoru, yamasaki, s, world, trade, center, buildings, another, return, was, that, of, the, wit, ornament, and, reference, seen, in, older, buildings, in, terra, cotta, decorative, fa, ades, and, bronze, or, stainless, steel, embellishments, of, the, beaux, arts, and, art, deco, periods, in, postmodern, structures, this, was, often, achieved, by, placing, contradictory, quotes, of, previous, building, styles, alongside, each, other, and, even, incorporating, furniture, stylistic, references, at, a, huge, scale, contextualism, a, trend, in, thinking, in, the, later, parts, of, 20th, century, influences, the, ideologies, of, the, postmodern, movement, in, general, contextualism, is, centered, on, the, belief, that, all, knowledge, is, context, sensitive, this, idea, was, even, taken, further, to, say, that, knowledge, cannot, be, understood, without, considering, its, context, while, noteworthy, examples, of, modern, architecture, responded, both, subtly, and, directly, to, their, physical, context, postmodern, architecture, often, addressed, the, context, in, terms, of, the, materials, forms, and, details, of, the, buildings, around, it, the, cultural, context, the, postmodernist, movement, is, often, seen, especially, in, the, us, as, an, american, movement, starting, in, america, around, the, 1960s, 1970s, and, then, spreading, to, europe, and, the, rest, of, the, world, to, remain, right, through, to, the, present, in, 1966, however, the, architectural, historian, sir, nikolaus, pevsner, spoke, of, a, revived, expressionism, as, being, a, new, style, successor, to, my, international, modern, of, the, 1930s, a, post, modern, style, and, included, as, examples, le, corbusier, s, work, at, ronchamp, and, chandigarh, denys, lasdun, at, the, royal, college, of, physicians, in, london, richard, sheppard, at, churchill, college, cambridge, and, james, stirling, s, and, james, gowan, s, leicester, engineering, building, as, well, as, philip, johnson, s, own, guest, house, at, new, canaan, connecticut, pevsner, disapproved, of, these, buildings, for, their, self, expression, and, irrationalism, but, he, acknowledged, them, as, the, legitimate, style, of, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, and, defined, their, characteristics, the, job, of, defining, postmodernism, was, subsequently, taken, over, by, a, younger, generation, who, welcomed, rather, than, rejected, what, they, saw, happening, and, in, the, case, of, robert, venturi, contributed, to, it, the, aims, of, postmodernism, or, late, modernism, begin, with, its, reaction, to, modernism, it, tries, to, address, the, limitations, of, its, predecessor, the, list, of, aims, is, extended, to, include, communicating, ideas, with, the, public, often, in, a, then, humorous, or, witty, way, often, the, communication, is, done, by, quoting, extensively, from, past, architectural, styles, often, many, at, once, in, breaking, away, from, modernism, it, also, strives, to, produce, buildings, that, are, sensitive, to, the, context, within, which, they, are, built, postmodernism, has, its, origins, in, the, perceived, failure, of, modern, architecture, its, preoccupation, with, functionalism, and, economical, building, meant, that, ornaments, were, done, away, with, and, the, buildings, were, cloaked, in, a, stark, rational, appearance, many, felt, the, buildings, failed, to, meet, the, human, need, for, comfort, both, for, body, and, for, the, eye, that, modernism, did, not, account, for, the, desire, for, beauty, the, problem, worsened, when, some, already, monotonous, apartment, blocks, degenerated, into, slums, in, response, architects, sought, to, reintroduce, ornament, color, decoration, and, human, scale, to, buildings, form, was, no, longer, to, be, defined, solely, by, its, functional, requirements, or, minimal, appearance, critics, of, the, reductionism, of, modernism, often, noted, the, abandonment, of, the, teaching, of, architectural, history, as, a, causal, factor, the, fact, that, a, number, of, the, major, players, in, the, shift, away, from, modernism, were, trained, at, princeton, university, s, school, of, architecture, where, recourse, to, history, continued, to, be, a, part, of, design, training, in, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, was, significant, the, increasing, rise, of, interest, in, history, had, a, profound, impact, on, architectural, education, history, courses, became, more, typical, and, regularized, with, the, demand, for, professors, knowledgeable, in, the, history, of, architecture, program, were, developed, including, the, advanced, masters, level, course, in, the, history, and, theory, of, architecture, offered, by, dalibor, vesely, and, joseph, rykwert, at, the, university, of, essex, in, england, between, 1968, and, 1978, it, was, the, first, of, its, kind, other, programs, followed, suit, including, several, phd, programs, in, schools, of, architecture, that, arose, to, differentiate, themselves, from, art, history, phd, programs, where, architectural, historians, had, previously, trained, in, the, us, mit, and, cornell, were, the, first, created, in, the, mid, 1970s, followed, by, columbia, berkeley, and, princeton, among, the, founders, of, new, architectural, history, programs, were, bruno, zevi, at, the, institute, for, the, history, of, architecture, in, venice, stanford, anderson, and, henry, millon, at, mit, alexander, tzonis, at, the, architectural, association, anthony, vidler, at, princeton, manfredo, tafuri, at, the, university, of, venice, kenneth, frampton, at, columbia, university, and, werner, oechslin, and, kurt, forster, at, eth, z, rich, the, creation, of, these, programs, was, paralleled, by, the, hiring, in, the, 1970s, of, professionally, trained, historians, by, schools, of, architecture, margaret, crawford, with, a, phd, from, ucla, at, sci, arc, elisabeth, grossman, phd, brown, university, at, rhode, island, school,

at, harvard, to, name, just, a, few, examples, a, second, generation, of, scholars, then, emerged, that, began, to, extend, these, efforts, in, the, direction, of, what, is, now, called, theory, k,

postmodernism, with, its, diversity, possesses, sensitivity, to, the, building, s, context, and, history, and, the, client, s, requirements, the, postmodernist, architects, often, considered, the, general, requirements, of, the, urban, buildings, and, their, surroundings, during, the, building, s, design, for, example, in, frank, gehry, s, venice, beach, house, the, neighboring, houses, have, a, similar, bright, flat, color, this, vernacular, sensitivity, is, often, evident, but, other, times, the, designs, respond, to, more, high, style, neighbors, james, stirling, s, arthur, m, sackler,

not, necessarily, following, principles, of, postmodernism, concurrently, the, recent, movements, of, new, urbanism, and, new, classical, architecture, promote, a, sustainable, approach, toward, construction, that, appreciates, and, develops, smart, growth, architectural, tradition, and, classical, design, this, in, contrast, to, modernist, and, globally, uniform, architecture, as, well, as,

ornamentation, as, broader, postmodernism, first, brought, to, attention, in, 1996, the, style, is, notable, for, being, designed, and, championed, by, indigenous, peruvians, and, bolivians, and, takes, inspiration, from, ancient, inca, and, andean, designs, some, of, the, best, known, and, influential, architects, in, the, postmodern, style, are
