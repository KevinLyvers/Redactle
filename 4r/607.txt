showing, films, in, other, west, african, countries, the, success, of, his, exhibition, led, to, a, european, merchant, stanley, jones, to, begin, showing, films, in, the, same, glover, memorial, hall, starting, from, november, 1903, this, brought, about, the, influx, of, more, european, film, exhibitors, to, nigeria, the, first, film, hit, in, this, early, period, came, on, 3, august, 1904,

operations, of, cinema, houses, in, the, colony, nigerian, content, in, films, made, and, shown, in, nigerian, cinemas, during, this, period, were, however, virtually, non, existent, as, the, production, and, distribution, were, controlled, by, foreigners, motion, picture, entertainment, was, as, a, result, complemented, by, the, yoruba, travel, theatre, groups, which, emerged, in, the, 1930s, through, 1940s, one, of, the, most, prominent, were, the, agbegijo, and, alarinjo, theatre, groups, which, featured, theatre, actors, such, as, duro, ladipo, ishola, ogunmola, lere, paimo, oyin, adejobi, amongst, others, in, 1949, through, 1950, the, state, of, affairs, changed, a, bit, with, more, nigerian, contents, being, exhibited, in, cinemas, with, a, purported, drive, to, africanize, film, production, the, nigerian, film, unit, was, established, in, order, to, decentralize, colonial, film, production, the, colonial, film, unit, throughout, the, decade, exhibited, health, and, educational, films, to, local, audiences, through, its, mobile, cinema, vans, it, also, produced, newsreels, and, short, documentaries, depicting, celebrations, and, colonial, achievements, to, domestic, and, overseas, audiences, after, nigeria, s, independence, in, 1960, the, cinema, business, rapidly, expanded, with, new, cinema, houses, being, established, however, there, came, a, significant, influx, of, american, indian, chinese, and, japanese, films, posters, of, films, from, these, countries, were, all, over, theatre, halls, and, actors, from, these, industries, became, very, popular, in, nigeria, towards, the, late, 1960s, and, into, the, 1970s, nigerian, productions, in, movie, houses, increased, gradually, especially, productions, from, western, nigeria, owing, to, former, theatre, practitioners, such, as, hubert, ogunde, ola, balogun, moses, olaiya, jab, adu, isola, ogunsola, ladi, ladebo, sanya, dosumu, and, sadiq, balewa, amongst, others, transitioning, into, the, big, screen, the, first, fully, commercial, nigerian, films, shot, on, celluloid, were, also, made, by, these, filmmakers, in, the, 1960s, in, 1972, concerned, about, the, influx, of, foreign, culture, into, nigeria, the, indigenization, decree, was, issued, by, the, then, head, of, state, yakubu, gowon, which, demands, the, transfer, of, ownership, of, about, a, total, of, 300, film, theatres, in, the, country, from, their, foreign, owners, to, nigerians, also, more, nigerians, started, playing, active, roles, in, cinema, establishment, as, a, result, of, this, policy, this, transfer, also, resulted, in, the, emergence, of, nigerian, playwrights, screenwriters, and, film, producers, popular, literature, and, theatre, works, were, adapted, into, motion, pictures, the, oil, boom, of, 1973, through, 1978, contributed, immensely, to, the, spontaneous, boost, of, the, cinema, culture, in, nigeria, the, presence, of, foreign, investments, led, to, the, erection, of, several, cinema, complexes, in, 1976, the, 5000, capacity, national, arts, theatre, iganmu, was, constructed, in, lagos, the, theatre, was, incorporated, with, two, cinemas, each, having, a, capacity, of, over, 700, people, at, this, time, cinema, business, had, become, a, notable, employer, of, many, people, and, also, served, as, an, important, social, function, as, nigerians, visited, cinemas, for, relaxation, and, entertainment, purposes, the, increased, purchasing, power, in, nigeria, also, made, a, wide, range, of, citizens, to, have, disposable, income, to, spend, on, cinema, going, and, on, home, television, sets, television, broadcasting, in, nigeria, began, in, the, 1960s, and, received, much, government, support, in, its, early, years, by, the, mid, 1980s, every, state, had, its, own, broadcasting, station, law, limited, foreign, content, on, television, so, producers, in, lagos, began, televising, local, popular, theatre, productions, many, of, these, were, circulated, on, video, as, well, and, a, small, scale, informal, video, movie, trade, developed, as, of, late, 1980s, the, cinema, culture, was, beginning, to, face, a, major, decline, and, most, nigerian, film, producers, had, transitioned, to, television, productions, the, gradual, decline, of, the, golden, era, of, nigerian, cinema, has, been, attributed, to, several, factors, including, the, reduction, in, the, value, of, naira, lack, of, finance, and, marketing, support, lack, of, standard, film, studios, and, production, equipment, frequent, government, structural, adjustment, programmes, due, to, military, dictatorships, as, well, as, inexperience, on, the, part, of, practitioners, the, drastic, decline, in, cinema, culture, resulted, in, some, of, the, existing, cinema, houses, being, acquired, by, religious, bodies, and, turned, to, churches, others, were, simply, just, closed, down, in, the, early, 1990s, only, a, few, of, the, once, vibrant, cinema, houses, were, still, in, operation, and, all, had, collapsed, before, 1999, the, emergence, of, the, video, film, market, in, nigeria, is, traced, back, to, the, 1980s, when, television, productions, thrived, jimi, odumosu, s, evil, encounter, a, 1983, horror, film, released, directly, on, television, was, the, first, production, to, be, a, pointer, to, how, lucrative, making, film, directly, on, video, could, be, the, film, was, extensively, promoted, before, being, aired, on, television, and, as, a, result, had, streets, flooded, in, the, following, morning, with, video, copies, of, the, recorded, broadcast, it, was, reported, that, the, film, became, an, instant, hit, at, alaba, market, a, commercial, district, which, later, became, the, hub, of, video, distribution, in, this, period, and, also, eventually, became, the, hub, of, piracy, in, nigeria, since, evil, encounter, it, became, common, especially, in, southern, nigerian, cities, to, see, video, copies, of, recorded, television, programmes, traded, on, the, streets, this, method, was, adopted, and, built, on, by, producers, and, distributors, at, alaba, market, to, reinvent, the, film, industry, since, the, nigerian, cinema, culture, was, facing, a, major, decline, the, first, film, produced, on, video, in, nigeria, was, 1988, s, soso, meji, produced, by, ade, ajiboye, the, film, was, also, screened, at, the, few, available, theatres, at, the, time, subsequently, alade, aromire, produced, ekun, 1989, on, video, which, was, screened, at, the, national, theatre, iganmu, however, the, boom, experienced, in, this, era, is, generally, believed, to, have, been, kickstarted, by, kenneth, nnebue, s, living, in, bondage, 1992, nnebue, had, an, excess, number, of, imported, video, cassettes, which, he, then, used, to, shoot, his, first, film, on, a, video, camera, although, living, in, bondage, is, often, touted, in, the, media, as, the, first, commercial, video, film, several, historians, have, argued, that, the, video, film, industry, was, already, booming, before, living, in, bondage, as, of, 2004, at, least, four, to, five, films, were, produced, every, day, in, nigeria, nigerian, movies, had, also, already, dominated, television, screens, across, the, african, continent, and, by, extension, the, diaspora, the, film, actors, also, became, household, names, across, the, continent, and, the, movies, significantly, influenced, cultures, in, many, african, nations, from, ways, of, dressing, to, speech, and, usage, of, nigerian, slangs, this, was, attributed, to, the, fact, that, nigerian, films, told, relatable, stories, which, made, foreign, films, to, gather, dust, on, the, shelves, of, video, stores, even, though, they, cost, much, less, according, to, the, filmmakers, cooperative, of, nigeria, every, film, in, nigeria, had, a, potential, audience, of, 15, million, people, in, nigeria, and, about, 5, million, outside, nigeria, in, no, time, the, industry, became, the, third, largest, producer, of, films, in, the, world, however, this, didn, t, translate, to, an, overtly, commercial, film, industry, when, compared, to, other, major, film, hubs, across, the, world, the, worth, of, the, industry, was, approximated, at, just, about, us, 250, million, since, most, of, the, films, produced, were, cheaply, made, the, film, industry, regardless, became, a, major, employer, in, nigeria, as, of, 2007, with, a, total, number, of, 6, 841, registered, video, parlours, and, an, estimated, 500, 000, unregistered, ones, the, estimated, revenue, generated, by, sales, and, rentals, of, movies, in, lagos, state, alone, was, estimated, to, be, 804, million, us, 5, million, per, week, which, adds, up, to, an, estimated, 33, 5, billion, us, 209, million, revenue, for, lagos, state, per, annum, approximately, 700, 000, discs, were, sold, in, alaba, market, per, day, with, the, total, sales, revenue, generated, by, the, film, industry, in, nigeria, estimated, at, 522, billion, us, 3, billion, per, annum, with, broadcast, content, valued, at, 250, billion, us, 1, 6, billion, at, the, peak, of, the, video, era, at, around, 2008, the, industry, had, become, the, second, largest, producer, of, films, releasing, approximately, 200, video, films, monthly, however, at, this, point, the, nigerian, film, industry, had, practically, degenerated, into, a, visionless, industry, with, the, invasion, of, several, people, who, did, not, know, a, thing, about, filmmaking, and, piracy, was, at, its, peak, dealing, with, the, menace, of, piracy, amongst, other, problems, became, a, hard, nut, to, crack, as, a, result, of, this, most, investors, of, the, alaba, cartel, who, control, almost, 90, percent, stakes, in, the, video, industry, began, to, channel, their, money, into, other, business, ventures, instead, the, decline, of, the, home, video, era, has, been, attributed, to, several, factors, such, as, the, refusal, of, the, government, to, provide, support, and, funding, the, lack, of, a, formal, and, effective, indigenous, film, distribution, infrastructure, and, the, increase, in, the, cost, of, production, in, nigeria, this, is, an, emerging, phase, in, nigerian, cinema, in, which, there, became, a, major, shift, in, the, method, of, film, production, from, the, video, format, back, to, the, cinema, method, which, constituted, the, films, produced, in, the, golden, era, a, few, years, into, the, 21st, century, nigeria, began, to, experience, the, growth, of, cinemas, which, was, initially, structured, for, the, middle, and, upper, classes, the, silverbird, group, is, the, first, company, to, launch, a, series, of, modern, cinema, houses, across, major, cities, in, nigeria, mostly, situated, in, affluent, areas, and, districts, it, launched, its, cinema, chains, in, 2004, starting, with, the, silverbird, galleria, in, victoria, island, lagos, the, silverbird, galleria, is, a, large, shopping, mall, with, an, upscale, cinema, facility, and, various, outlets, where, mercantile, activities, take, place, this, provides, more, reasons, to, visit, the, place, beyond, just, watching, films, but, more, of, a, social, activity, and, a, modified, sort, of, entertainment, beyond, film, watching, this, trend, has, given, another, probable, explanation, as, to, the, demise, of, the, nigerian, cinema, culture, in, the, 1980s, which, might, have, been, as, a, result, of, the, unfashionable, appearance, of, most, cinemas, of, the, golden, era, silverbird, cinemas, upon, establishment, started, screening, nigerian, films, with, high, production, quality, as, a, result, discouraging, poor, film, production, the, first, new, wave, film, to, be, shown, at, a, cinema, was, the, yoruba, language, film, irapada, 2006, by, kunle, afolayan, which, was, screened, at, the, silverbird, galleria, in, lagos, the, silverbird, experiment, became, very, successful, and, as, a, result, the, group, launched, a, few, more, cinema, branches, in, lagos, and, other, cities, in, the, country, not, long, after, the, establishment, of, silverbird, cinemas, genesis, deluxe, cinemas, and, ozone, cinemas, were, also, launched, creating, a, competition, in, the, cinema, business, much, later, in, the, 2010s, filmhouse, cinemas, also, came, into, the, picture, leading, to, the, availability, of, more, cinemas, in, the, country, especially, outside, the, affluent, neighbourhoods, several, grants, have, been, launched, by, the, nigerian, government, in, order, to, support, quality, content, in, nigerian, films, in, 2006, project, nollywood, was, launched, by, the, nigerian, government, in, conjunction, with, ecobank, the, project, provided, 100, million, us, 781, 000, to, nigerian, filmmakers, to, produce, high, quality, films, and, to, fund, a, multimillion, naira, distribution, network, across, the, country, during, this, period, in, 2010, the, administration, of, president, goodluck, jonathan, launched, a, 30, billion, us, 200, million, creative, and, entertainment, industry, intervention, fund, financed, by, bank, of, industry, boi, in, conjunction, with, nigerian, export, and, import, nexim, bank, this, grant, although, dubbed, as, a, spin, off, of, project, nollywood, was, for, the, entire, nigerian, creative, arts, and, entertainment, sector, the, vision, of, the, grant, for, the, film, industry, however, is, to, help, more, nigerian, filmmakers, in, training, funding, and, also, help, in, creating, necessary, infrastructure, for, the, industry, in, 2013, a, smaller, new, grant, of, 3, billion, us, 20, million, was, awarded, once, again, solely, for, nollywood, and, specifically, for, the, production, of, high, quality, films, and, to, sponsor, filmmakers, for, formal, training, in, film, schools, also, in, 2015, bank, of, industry, launched, another, nollyfund, program, for, the, purpose, of, giving, financial, support, in, form, of, loans, to, film, producers, the, popular, 2009, thriller, film, the, figurine, is, generally, considered, the, game, changer, which, heightened, the, media, attention, towards, the, new, nigerian, cinema, revolution, the, film, was, a, critical, and, commercial, success, in, nigeria, and, it, was, also, screened, in, international, film, festivals, the, 2010, film, ij, by, chineze, anyaene, overtook, the, figurine, to, become, the, highest, grossing, nigerian, film, a, record, it, held, for, four, years, until, it, was, overtaken, in, 2014, by, half, of, a, yellow, sun, 2013, by, 2016, this, record, was, held, by, the, wedding, party, a, film, by, kemi, adetiba, by, the, end, of, 2013, the, film, industry, reportedly, hit, a, record, breaking, revenue, of, 1, 72, trillion, us, 11, billion, as, of, 2014, the, industry, was, worth, 853, 9, billion, us, 5, 1, billion, making, it, the, third, most, valuable, film, industry, in, the, world, behind, the, united, states, and, india, it, contributed, about, 1, 4, to, nigeria, s, economy, this, was, attributed, to, the, increase, in, the, number, of, quality, films, produced, and, more, formal, distribution, methods, unlike, the, home, video, era, films, in, the, new, wave, are, generally, of, much, improved, quality, with, considerably, bigger, budgets, averaging, between, 40, million, us, 250, 000, and, 120, million, 750, 000, these, films, production, periods, take, months, and, even, span, into, years, a, far, cry, from, the, films, in, video, format, which, are, usually, shot, in, a, matter, of, days, or, weeks, other, notable, improvements, in, the, new, nollywood, include, more, subtle, performances, from, actors, different, from, the, overt, melodrama, which, constituted, the, video, era, more, practical, more, logical, and, generally, better, stories, themes, explored, in, these, films, are, often, characterized, by, consciously, cosmopolitan, themes, as, most, of, the, filmmakers, are, relatively, young, a, proper, copyright, and, distribution, system, still, remains, one, of, the, major, challenges, in, the, new, nigerian, cinema, in, the, 2023, sundance, film, festival, the, nigerian, film, mami, wata, won, the, special, jury, award, for, cinematography, the, animated, short, film, mor, mi, by, lagosian, shof, coker, was, included, in, the, anthology, kizazi, moto, generation, fire, by,
