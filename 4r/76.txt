the, natural, history, museum, in, london, is, a, museum, that, exhibits, a, vast, range, of, specimens, from, various, segments, of, natural, history, it, is, one, of, three, major, museums, on, exhibition, road, in, south, kensington, the, others, being, the, science, museum, and, the, victoria, and, albert, museum, the, natural, history, museum, s, main, frontage, however, is, on, cromwell, road, the, museum, is, home, to, life, and, earth, science, specimens, comprising, some, 80, million, items, within, five, main, collections, botany, entomology, mineralogy, palaeontology, and, zoology, the, museum, is, a, centre, of, research, specialising, in, taxonomy, identification, and, conservation, given, the, age, of, the, institution, many, of, the, collections, have, great, historical, as, well, as, scientific, value, such, as, specimens, collected, by, charles, darwin, the, museum, is, particularly, famous, for, its, exhibition, of, dinosaur, skeletons, and, ornate, architecture, sometimes, dubbed, a, cathedral, of, nature, both, exemplified, by, the, large, diplodocus, cast, that, dominated, the, vaulted, central, hall, before, it, was, replaced, in, 2017, with, the, skeleton, of, a, blue, whale, hanging, from, the, ceiling, the, natural, history, museum, library, contains, an, extensive, collection, of, books, journals, manuscripts, and, artwork, linked, to, the, work, and, research, of, the, scientific, departments, access, to, the, library, is, by, appointment, only, the, museum, is, recognised, as, the, pre, eminent, centre, of, natural, history, and, research, of, related, fields, in, the, world, although, commonly, referred, to, as, the, natural, history, museum, it, was, officially, known, as, british, museum, natural, history, until, 1992, despite, legal, separation, from, the, british, museum, itself, in, 1963, originating, from, collections, within, the, british, museum, the, landmark, alfred, waterhouse, building, was, built, and, opened, by, 1881, and, later, incorporated, the, geological, museum, the, darwin, centre, is, a, more, recent, addition, partly, designed, as, a, modern, facility, for, storing, the, valuable, collections, like, other, publicly, funded, national, museums, in, the, united, kingdom, the, natural, history, museum, does, not, charge, an, admission, fee, the, museum, is, an, exempt, charity, and, a, non, departmental, public, body, sponsored, by, the, department, for, culture, media, and, sport, the, princess, of, wales, is, a, patron, of, the, museum, there, are, approximately, 850, staff, at, the, museum, the, two, largest, strategic, groups, are, the, public, engagement, group, and, science, group, the, foundation, of, the, collection, was, that, of, the, ulster, doctor, sir, hans, sloane, 1660, 1753, who, allowed, his, significant, collections, to, be, purchased, by, the, british, government, at, a, price, well, below, their, market, value, at, the, time, this, purchase, was, funded, by, a, lottery, sloane, s, collection, which, included, dried, plants, and, animal, and, human, skeletons, was, initially, housed, in, montagu, house, bloomsbury, in, 1756, which, was, the, home, of, the, british, museum, most, of, the, sloane, collection, had, disappeared, by, the, early, decades, of, the, nineteenth, century, dr, george, shaw, keeper, of, natural, history, 1806, 1813, sold, many, specimens, to, the, royal, college, of, surgeons, and, had, periodic, cremations, of, material, in, the, grounds, of, the, museum, his, successors, also, applied, to, the, trustees, for, permission, to, destroy, decayed, specimens, in, 1833, the, annual, report, states, that, of, the, 5, 500, insects, listed, in, the, sloane, catalogue, none, remained, the, inability, of, the, natural, history, departments, to, conserve, its, specimens, became, notorious, the, treasury, refused, to, entrust, it, with, specimens, collected, at, the, government, s, expense, appointments, of, staff, were, bedevilled, by, gentlemanly, favouritism, in, 1862, a, nephew, of, the, mistress, of, a, trustee, was, appointed, entomological, assistant, despite, not, knowing, the, difference, between, a, butterfly, and, a, moth, j, e, gray, keeper, of, zoology, 1840, 1874, complained, of, the, incidence, of, mental, illness, amongst, staff, george, shaw, threatened, to, put, his, foot, on, any, shell, not, in, the, 12th, edition, of, linnaeus, systema, naturae, another, had, removed, all, the, labels, and, registration, numbers, from, entomological, cases, arranged, by, a, rival, the, huge, collection, of, the, conchologist, hugh, cuming, was, acquired, by, the, museum, and, gray, s, own, wife, had, carried, the, open, trays, across, the, courtyard, in, a, gale, all, the, labels, blew, away, that, collection, is, said, never, to, have, recovered, the, principal, librarian, at, the, time, was, antonio, panizzi, his, contempt, for, the, natural, history, departments, and, for, science, in, general, was, total, the, general, public, was, not, encouraged, to, visit, the, museum, s, natural, history, exhibits, in, 1835, to, a, select, committee, of, parliament, sir, henry, ellis, said, this, policy, was, fully, approved, by, the, principal, librarian, and, his, senior, colleagues, many, of, these, faults, were, corrected, by, the, palaeontologist, richard, owen, appointed, superintendent, of, the, natural, history, departments, of, the, british, museum, in, 1856, his, changes, led, bill, bryson, to, write, that, by, making, the, natural, history, museum, an, institution, for, everyone, owen, transformed, our, expectations, of, what, museums, are, for, owen, saw, that, the, natural, history, departments, needed, more, space, and, that, implied, a, separate, building, as, the, british, museum, site, was, limited, land, in, south, kensington, was, purchased, and, in, 1864, a, competition, was, held, to, design, the, new, museum, the, winning, entry, was, submitted, by, the, civil, engineer, captain, francis, fowke, who, died, shortly, afterwards, the, scheme, was, taken, over, by, alfred, waterhouse, who, substantially, revised, the, agreed, plans, and, designed, the, fa, ades, in, his, own, idiosyncratic, romanesque, style, which, was, inspired, by, his, frequent, visits, to, the, continent, the, original, plans, included, wings, on, either, side, of, the, main, building, but, these, plans, were, soon, abandoned, for, budgetary, reasons, the, space, these, would, have, occupied, are, now, taken, by, the, earth, galleries, and, darwin, centre, work, began, in, 1873, and, was, completed, in, 1880, the, new, museum, opened, in, 1881, although, the, move, from, the, old, museum, was, not, fully, completed, until, 1883, both, the, interiors, and, exteriors, of, the, waterhouse, building, make, extensive, use, of, architectural, terracotta, tiles, to, resist, the, sooty, atmosphere, of, victorian, london, manufactured, by, the, tamworth, based, company, of, gibbs, and, canning, the, tiles, and, bricks, feature, many, relief, sculptures, of, flora, and, fauna, with, living, and, extinct, species, featured, within, the, west, and, east, wings, respectively, this, explicit, separation, was, at, the, request, of, owen, and, has, been, seen, as, a, statement, of, his, contemporary, rebuttal, of, darwin, s, attempt, to, link, present, species, with, past, through, the, theory, of, natural, selection, though, waterhouse, slipped, in, a, few, anomalies, such, as, bats, amongst, the, extinct, animals, and, a, fossil, ammonite, with, the, living, species, the, sculptures, were, produced, from, clay, models, by, a, french, sculptor, based, in, london, m, dujardin, working, to, drawings, prepared, by, the, architect, the, central, axis, of, the, museum, is, aligned, with, the, tower, of, imperial, college, london, formerly, the, imperial, institute, and, the, royal, albert, hall, and, albert, memorial, further, north, these, all, form, part, of, the, complex, known, colloquially, as, albertopolis, even, after, the, opening, the, natural, history, museum, legally, remained, a, department, of, the, british, museum, with, the, formal, name, british, museum, natural, history, usually, abbreviated, in, the, scientific, literature, as, b, m, n, h, a, petition, to, the, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, was, made, in, 1866, signed, by, the, heads, of, the, royal, linnean, and, zoological, societies, as, well, as, naturalists, including, darwin, wallace, and, huxley, asking, that, the, museum, gain, independence, from, the, board, of, the, british, museum, and, heated, discussions, on, the, matter, continued, for, nearly, one, hundred, years, finally, with, the, passing, of, the, british, museum, act, 1963, the, british, museum, natural, history, became, an, independent, museum, with, its, own, board, of, trustees, although, despite, a, proposed, amendment, to, the, act, in, the, house, of, lords, the, former, name, was, retained, in, 1989, the, museum, publicly, re, branded, itself, as, the, natural, history, museum, and, stopped, using, the, title, british, museum, natural, history, on, its, advertising, and, its, books, for, general, readers, only, with, the, museums, and, galleries, act, 1992, did, the, museum, s, formal, title, finally, change, to, the, natural, history, museum, in, 1985, the, museum, merged, with, the, adjacent, geological, museum, of, the, british, geological, survey, which, had, long, competed, for, the, limited, space, available, in, the, area, the, geological, museum, became, world, famous, for, exhibitions, including, an, active, volcano, model, and, an, earthquake, machine, designed, by, james, gardner, and, housed, the, world, s, first, computer, enhanced, exhibition, treasures, of, the, earth, the, museum, s, galleries, were, completely, rebuilt, and, relaunched, in, 1996, as, the, earth, galleries, with, the, other, exhibitions, in, the, waterhouse, building, retitled, the, life, galleries, the, natural, history, museum, s, own, mineralogy, displays, remain, largely, unchanged, as, an, example, of, the, 19th, century, display, techniques, of, the, waterhouse, building, the, central, atrium, design, by, neal, potter, overcame, visitors, reluctance, to, visit, the, upper, galleries, by, pulling, them, through, a, model, of, the, earth, made, up, of, random, plates, on, an, escalator, the, new, design, covered, the, walls, in, recycled, slate, and, sandblasted, the, major, stars, and, planets, onto, the, wall, the, museum, s, star, geological, exhibits, are, displayed, within, the, walls, six, iconic, figures, were, the, backdrop, to, discussing, how, previous, generations, have, viewed, earth, these, were, later, removed, to, make, place, for, a, stegosaurus, skeleton, that, was, put, on, display, in, late, 2015, the, darwin, centre, named, after, charles, darwin, was, designed, as, a, new, home, for, the, museum, s, collection, of, tens, of, millions, of, preserved, specimens, as, well, as, new, work, spaces, for, the, museum, s, scientific, staff, and, new, educational, visitor, experiences, built, in, two, distinct, phases, with, two, new, buildings, adjacent, to, the, main, waterhouse, building, it, is, the, most, significant, new, development, project, in, the, museum, s, history, phase, one, of, the, darwin, centre, opened, to, the, public, in, 2002, and, it, houses, the, zoological, department, s, spirit, collections, organisms, preserved, in, alcohol, phase, two, was, unveiled, in, september, 2008, and, opened, to, the, general, public, in, september, 2009, it, was, designed, by, the, danish, architecture, practice, c, f, m, ller, architects, in, the, shape, of, a, giant, eight, story, cocoon, and, houses, the, entomology, and, botanical, collections, the, dry, collections, it, is, possible, for, members, of, the, public, to, visit, and, view, non, exhibited, items, for, a, fee, by, booking, onto, one, of, the, several, spirit, collection, tours, offered, daily, arguably, the, most, famous, creature, in, the, centre, is, the, 8, 62, metre, long, giant, squid, affectionately, named, archie, as, part, of, the, museum, s, remit, to, communicate, science, education, and, conservation, work, a, new, multimedia, studio, forms, an, important, part, of, darwin, centre, phase, 2, in, collaboration, with, the, bbc, s, natural, history, unit, holder, of, the, largest, archive, of, natural, history, footage, the, attenborough, studio, named, after, the, broadcaster, sir, david, attenborough, provides, a, multimedia, environment, for, educational, events, the, studio, holds, regular, lectures, and, demonstrations, including, free, nature, live, talks, on, fridays, saturdays, and, sundays, one, of, the, most, famous, and, certainly, most, prominent, of, the, exhibits, nicknamed, dippy, is, a, 105, foot, 32, m, long, replica, of, a, diplodocus, carnegii, skeleton, which, was, on, display, for, many, years, within, the, central, hall, the, cast, was, given, as, a, gift, by, the, scottish, american, industrialist, andrew, carnegie, after, a, discussion, with, king, edward, vii, then, a, keen, trustee, of, the, british, museum, carnegie, paid, 2, 000, equivalent, to, 272, 185, in, 2023, for, the, casting, copying, the, original, held, at, the, carnegie, museum, of, natural, history, the, pieces, were, sent, to, london, in, 36, crates, and, on, 12, may, 1905, the, exhibit, was, unveiled, to, great, public, and, media, interest, the, real, fossil, had, yet, to, be, mounted, as, the, carnegie, museum, in, pittsburgh, was, still, being, constructed, to, house, it, as, word, of, dippy, spread, mr, carnegie, paid, to, have, additional, copies, made, for, display, in, most, major, european, capitals, and, in, central, and, south, america, making, dippy, the, most, viewed, dinosaur, skeleton, in, the, world, the, dinosaur, quickly, became, an, iconic, representation, of, the, museum, and, has, featured, in, many, cartoons, and, other, media, including, the, 1975, disney, comedy, one, of, our, dinosaurs, is, missing, after, 112, years, on, display, at, the, museum, the, dinosaur, replica, was, removed, in, early, 2017, to, be, replaced, by, the, actual, skeleton, of, a, young, blue, whale, a, 128, year, old, skeleton, nicknamed, hope, dippy, went, on, a, tour, of, various, british, museums, starting, in, 2018, and, concluding, in, 2020, at, norwich, cathedral, the, blue, whale, skeleton, hope, that, has, replaced, dippy, is, another, prominent, display, in, the, museum, the, display, of, the, skeleton, some, 82, feet, 25, m, long, and, weighing, 4, 5, tonnes, was, only, made, possible, in, 1934, with, the, building, of, the, new, whale, hall, now, the, mammals, blue, whale, model, gallery, the, whale, had, been, in, storage, for, 42, years, since, its, stranding, on, sandbanks, at, the, mouth, of, wexford, harbour, ireland, in, march, 1891, after, being, injured, by, whalers, at, this, time, it, was, first, displayed, in, the, mammals, blue, whale, model, gallery, but, now, takes, pride, of, place, in, the, museum, s, hintze, hall, discussion, of, the, idea, of, a, life, sized, model, also, began, around, 1934, and, work, was, undertaken, within, the, whale, hall, itself, since, taking, a, cast, of, such, a, large, animal, was, deemed, prohibitively, expensive, scale, models, were, used, to, meticulously, piece, the, structure, together, during, construction, workmen, left, a, trapdoor, within, the, whale, s, stomach, which, they, would, use, for, surreptitious, cigarette, breaks, before, the, door, was, closed, and, sealed, forever, some, coins, and, a, telephone, directory, were, placed, inside, this, soon, growing, to, an, urban, myth, that, a, time, capsule, was, left, inside, the, work, was, completed, entirely, within, the, hall, and, in, view, of, the, public, in, 1938, at, the, time, it, was, the, largest, such, model, in, the, world, at, 92, feet, 28, m, in, length, the, construction, details, were, later, borrowed, by, several, american, museums, who, scaled, the, plans, further, the, work, involved, in, removing, dippy, and, replacing, it, with, hope, was, documented, in, a, bbc, television, special, horizon, dippy, and, the, whale, narrated, by, david, attenborough, which, was, first, broadcast, on, bbc, two, on, 13, july, 2017, the, day, before, hope, was, unveiled, for, public, display, the, darwin, centre, is, host, to, archie, an, 8, 62, metre, long, giant, squid, taken, alive, in, a, fishing, net, near, the, falkland, islands, in, 2004, the, squid, is, not, on, general, display, but, stored, in, the, large, tank, room, in, the, basement, of, the, phase, 1, building, it, is, possible, for, members, of, the, public, to, visit, and, view, non, exhibited, items, behind, the, scenes, for, a, fee, by, booking, onto, one, of, the, several, spirit, collection, tours, offered, daily, on, arrival, at, the, museum, the, specimen, was, immediately, frozen, while, preparations, commenced, for, its, permanent, storage, since, few, complete, and, reasonably, fresh, examples, of, the, species, exist, wet, storage, was, chosen, leaving, the, squid, undissected, a, 9, 45, metre, acrylic, tank, was, constructed, by, the, same, team, that, provide, tanks, to, damien, hirst, and, the, body, preserved, using, a, mixture, of, formalin, and, saline, solution, the, museum, holds, the, remains, and, bones, of, the, river, thames, whale, a, northern, bottlenose, whale, that, lost, its, way, on, 20, january, 2006, and, swam, into, the, thames, although, primarily, used, for, research, purposes, and, held, at, the, museum, s, storage, site, at, wandsworth, dinocochlea, one, of, the, longer, standing, mysteries, of, paleontology, originally, thought, to, be, a, giant, gastropod, shell, then, a, coprolite, and, now, a, concretion, of, a, worm, s, tunnel, has, been, part, of, the, collection, since, its, discovery, in, 1921, the, museum, keeps, a, wildlife, garden, on, its, west, lawn, on, which, a, potentially, new, species, of, insect, resembling, arocatus, roeselii, was, discovered, in, 2007, the, museum, is, divided, into, four, sets, of, galleries, or, zones, each, colour, coded, to, follow, a, broad, theme, this, is, the, zone, that, can, be, entered, from, exhibition, road, on, the, east, side, of, the, building, it, is, a, gallery, themed, around, the, changing, history, of, the, earth, earth, s, treasury, shows, specimens, of, rocks, minerals, and, gemstones, behind, glass, in, a, dimly, lit, gallery, lasting, impressions, is, a, small, gallery, containing, specimens, of, rocks, plants, and, minerals, of, which, most, can, be, touched, this, zone, is, accessed, from, the, cromwell, road, entrance, via, the, hintze, hall, and, follows, the, theme, of, the, evolution, of, the, planet, to, the, left, of, the, hintze, hall, this, zone, explores, the, diversity, of, life, on, the, planet, enables, the, public, to, see, science, at, work, and, also, provides, spaces, for, relaxation, and, contemplation, accessible, from, queens, gate, the, museum, runs, a, series, of, educational, and, public, engagement, programmes, these, include, for, example, a, highly, praised, how, science, works, hands, on, workshop, for, school, students, demonstrating, the, use, of, microfossils, in, geological, research, the, museum, also, played, a, major, role, in, securing, designation, of, the, jurassic, coast, of, devon, and, dorset, as, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, and, has, subsequently, been, a, lead, partner, in, the, lyme, regis, fossil, festivals, in, 2005, the, museum, launched, a, project, to, develop, notable, gallery, characters, to, patrol, display, cases, including, facsimiles, of, carl, linnaeus, mary, anning, dorothea, bate, and, william, smith, they, tell, stories,
