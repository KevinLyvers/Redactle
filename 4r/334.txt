the, harp, is, a, stringed, musical, instrument, that, has, individual, strings, running, at, an, angle, to, its, soundboard, the, strings, are, plucked, with, the, fingers, harps, can, be, made, and, played, in, various, ways, standing, or, sitting, and, in, orchestras, or, concerts, its, most, common, form, is, triangular, in, shape, and, made, of, wood, some, have, multiple, rows, of, strings, and, pedal, attachments, ancient, depictions, of, harps, were, recorded, in, mesopotamia, now, iraq, persia, now, iran, and, egypt, and, later, in, india, and, china, by, medieval, times, harps, had, spread, across, europe, harps, were, found, across, the, americas, where, it, was, a, popular, folk, tradition, in, some, areas, distinct, designs, also, emerged, from, the, african, continent, harps, have, symbolic, political, traditions, and, are, often, used, in, logos, including, in, ireland, historically, strings, were, made, of, sinew, animal, tendons, other, materials, have, included, gut, animal, intestines, plant, fiber, braided, hemp, cotton, cord, silk, nylon, and, wire, in, pedal, harp, scores, double, flats, and, double, sharps, should, be, avoided, whenever, possible, harps, have, been, known, since, antiquity, in, asia, africa, and, europe, dating, back, at, least, as, early, as, 3000, bce, the, instrument, had, great, popularity, in, europe, during, the, middle, ages, and, renaissance, where, it, evolved, into, a, wide, range, of, variants, with, new, technologies, and, was, disseminated, to, europe, s, colonies, finding, particular, popularity, in, latin, america, although, some, ancient, members, of, the, harp, family, died, out, in, the, near, east, and, south, asia, descendants, of, early, harps, are, still, played, in, myanmar, and, parts, of, africa, other, variants, defunct, in, europe, and, asia, have, been, used, by, folk, musicians, in, the, modern, era, the, earliest, harps, and, lyres, were, found, in, sumer, 3500, bce, and, several, harps, were, excavated, from, burial, pits, and, royal, tombs, in, ur, the, oldest, depictions, of, harps, without, a, forepillar, can, be, seen, in, the, wall, paintings, of, ancient, egyptian, tombs, in, the, nile, valley, which, date, from, as, early, as, 3000, bce, these, murals, show, an, arched, harp, an, instrument, that, closely, resembles, the, hunter, s, bow, without, the, pillar, that, we, find, in, modern, harps, the, chang, flourished, in, persia, in, many, forms, from, its, introduction, about, 4000, bce, until, the, 17th, century, around, 1900, bce, arched, harps, in, the, iraq, iran, region, were, replaced, by, angular, harps, with, vertical, or, horizontal, sound, boxes, by, the, start, of, the, common, era, robust, vertical, angular, harps, which, had, become, predominant, in, the, hellenistic, world, were, cherished, in, the, sasanian, court, in, the, last, century, of, the, sasanian, period, angular, harps, were, redesigned, to, make, them, as, light, as, possible, light, vertical, angular, harps, while, they, became, more, elegant, they, lost, their, structural, rigidity, at, the, height, of, the, persian, tradition, of, illustrated, book, production, 1300, 1600, ce, such, light, harps, were, still, frequently, depicted, although, their, use, as, musical, instruments, was, reaching, its, end, marble, sculptures, of, seated, figures, playing, harps, are, known, from, the, cycladic, civilization, dating, from, 2800, 2700, bc, mesolithic, era, paintings, from, bhimbetka, show, harp, playing, an, arched, harp, made, of, wooden, brackets, and, metal, strings, is, depicted, on, an, indus, seal, the, works, of, the, tamil, sangam, literature, describe, the, harp, and, its, variants, as, early, as, 200, bce, variants, were, described, ranging, from, 14, to, 17, strings, and, the, instrument, used, by, wandering, minstrels, for, accompaniment, iconographic, evidence, of, the, yaal, appears, in, temple, statues, dated, as, early, as, 600, bce, one, of, the, sangam, works, the, kallaadam, recounts, how, the, first, yaa, harp, was, inspired, by, an, archer, s, bow, when, he, heard, the, musical, sound, of, its, twang, another, early, south, asian, harp, was, the, ancient, veena, not, to, be, confused, with, the, modern, indian, veena, which, is, a, type, of, lute, some, samudragupta, gold, coins, show, of, the, mid, 4th, century, ce, show, presumably, the, king, samudragupta, himself, playing, the, instrument, the, ancient, veena, survives, today, in, burma, in, the, form, of, the, saung, harp, still, played, there, the, harp, was, popular, in, ancient, china, and, neighboring, regions, though, harps, are, largely, extinct, in, east, asia, in, the, modern, day, the, chinese, konghou, harp, is, documented, as, early, as, the, spring, and, autumn, period, 770, 476, bce, and, became, extinct, during, the, ming, dynasty, 1368, 1644, ce, a, similar, harp, the, gonghu, was, played, in, ancient, korea, documented, as, early, as, the, goguryeo, period, 37, bce, 686, ce, while, the, angle, and, bow, harps, held, popularity, elsewhere, european, harps, favored, the, pillar, a, third, structural, member, to, support, the, far, ends, of, the, arch, and, soundbox, 290, a, harp, with, a, triangular, three, part, frame, is, depicted, on, 8th, century, pictish, stones, in, scotland, 290, and, in, manuscripts, e, g, the, utrecht, psalter, from, early, 9th, century, france, the, curve, of, the, harp, s, neck, is, a, result, of, the, proportional, shortening, of, the, basic, triangular, form, to, keep, the, strings, equidistant, if, the, strings, were, proportionately, distant, they, would, be, farther, apart, as, european, harps, evolved, to, play, more, complex, music, a, key, consideration, was, some, way, to, facilitate, the, quick, changing, of, a, string, s, pitch, to, be, able, to, play, more, chromatic, notes, by, the, baroque, period, in, italy, and, spain, more, strings, were, added, to, allow, for, chromatic, notes, in, more, complex, harps, in, germany, in, the, second, half, of, the, 17th, century, diatonic, single, row, harps, were, fitted, with, manually, turned, hooks, that, fretted, individual, strings, to, raise, their, pitch, by, a, half, step, in, the, 18th, century, a, link, mechanism, was, developed, connecting, these, hooks, with, pedals, leading, to, the, invention, of, the, single, action, pedal, harp, the, first, primitive, form, of, pedal, harps, was, developed, in, the, tyrol, region, of, austria, jacob, hochbrucker, was, the, next, to, design, an, improved, pedal, mechanism, around, 1720, followed, in, succession, by, krumpholtz, naderman, and, the, erard, company, who, came, up, with, the, double, mechanism, in, which, a, second, row, of, hooks, was, installed, along, the, neck, capable, of, raising, the, pitch, of, a, string, by, either, one, or, two, half, steps, while, one, course, of, european, harps, led, to, greater, complexity, resulting, largely, in, the, modern, pedal, harp, other, harping, traditions, maintained, simpler, diatonic, instruments, which, survived, and, evolved, into, modern, traditions, in, the, americas, harps, are, widely, but, sparsely, distributed, except, in, certain, regions, where, the, harp, traditions, are, very, strong, such, important, centeres, include, mexico, the, andean, region, venezuela, and, paraguay, they, are, derived, from, the, baroque, harps, that, were, brought, from, spain, during, the, colonial, period, detailed, features, vary, from, place, to, place, the, paraguayan, harp, is, that, country, s, national, instrument, and, has, gained, a, worldwide, reputation, with, international, influences, alongside, folk, traditions, they, have, around, 36, strings, are, played, with, fingernails, and, with, a, narrowing, spacing, and, lower, tension, than, modern, western, harps, and, have, a, wide, and, deep, soundbox, that, tapers, to, the, top, the, harp, is, also, found, in, argentina, though, in, uruguay, it, was, largely, displaced, in, religious, music, by, the, organ, by, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, the, harp, is, historically, found, in, brazil, but, mostly, in, the, south, of, the, country, the, andean, harp, spanish, quechua, arpa, also, known, as, the, peruvian, harp, or, indigenous, harp, is, widespread, among, peoples, living, in, the, highlands, of, the, andes, quechua, and, aymara, mainly, in, peru, and, also, in, bolivia, and, ecuador, it, is, relatively, large, with, a, significantly, increased, volume, of, the, resonator, box, which, gives, basses, a, special, richness, it, usually, accompanies, love, dances, and, songs, such, as, huayno, one, of, the, most, famous, performers, on, the, andean, harp, was, juan, cayambe, pimampiro, canton, imbabura, province, ecuador, mexican, jarocha, harp, music, of, veracruz, has, also, gained, some, international, recognition, evident, in, the, popularity, of, la, bamba, the, arpa, jarocha, is, typically, played, while, standing, in, southern, mexico, chiapas, there, is, a, very, different, indigenous, style, of, harp, music, the, harp, arrived, in, venezuela, with, spanish, colonists, there, are, two, distinct, traditions, the, arpa, llanera, harp, of, the, llanos, or, plains, and, the, arpa, central, of, the, central, area, by, the, 2020s, three, types, of, harps, are, typically, found, a, number, of, types, of, harps, are, found, in, africa, predominantly, not, of, the, three, sided, frame, harp, type, found, in, europe, a, number, of, these, referred, to, generically, as, african, harps, are, bow, or, angle, harps, which, lack, forepillars, joining, the, neck, to, the, body, a, number, of, harp, like, instruments, in, africa, are, not, easily, classified, with, european, categories, instruments, like, the, west, african, kora, and, mauritanian, ardin, are, sometimes, labeled, as, spike, harp, bridge, harp, or, harp, lute, since, their, construction, includes, a, bridge, which, holds, the, strings, laterally, vice, vertically, entering, the, soundboard, in, armenia, the, harp, has, been, used, since, the, fourth, century, bc, common, usages, included, weddings, and, funerals, the, antler, cup, with, a, feast, scene, found, inside, a, vessel, in, nor, aresh, and, now, preserved, in, the, erebuni, fortress, depicts, a, harp, information, about, early, medieval, armenian, musical, instruments, has, been, found, in, armenian, translations, of, the, bible, in, the, past, the, harp, was, played, in, the, royal, residences, in, the, royal, recreation, rooms, sometimes, not, only, the, royal, musicians, but, the, kings, themselves, played, the, instrument, of, course, in, the, past, harps, did, not, have, the, sound, capabilities, that, they, have, today, but, the, fact, that, the, armenian, people, had, the, harp, is, a, fact, armenians, have, had, the, instrument, of, harp, since, old, times, this, proves, that, armenians, loved, the, harp, and, used, it, in, their, everyday, life, at, weddings, and, burials, according, to, ysc, professor, scholar, of, middle, ages, doctor, of, arts, n, tahmizyan, many, pagan, musical, instruments, have, kept, their, initial, form, and, among, them, is, the, harp, which, was, played, not, only, at, ceremonies, the, instrument, was, performed, by, solo, performers, as, well, as, with, the, accompaniment, of, other, instruments, the, armenian, translation, of, the, bible, gives, a, lot, of, information, about, early, medieval, armenian, musical, instruments, the, translators, of, the, bible, use, the, name, harp, among, other, quite, popular, musical, instruments, in, armenian, a, verb, has, been, formed, from, the, name, of, the, instrument, which, means, to, play, the, harp, the, word, has, two, meanings, the, second, of, which, is, stringed, musical, instrument, which, has, the, form, of, a, triangular, frame, and, this, corresponds, to, the, description, of, the, musical, instrument, in, genesis, 4, 21, where, it, is, stated, other, usages, of, the, word, can, be, found, in, one, of, the, songs, of, 10th, century, armenian, medieval, writer, founder, of, the, renaissance, of, the, armenian, literature, cosmic, monk, grigor, narekatsi, the, song, is, called, song, of, vardavar, a, proof, of, the, instrument, s, armenian, origin, is, the, horn, glass, with, the, scene, of, feast, picture, which, is, kept, in, erebuni, museum, the, glass, was, found, in, a, big, buried, container, in, the, district, of, nor, aresh, next, to, erebuni, castle, in, 1968, during, construction, works, the, calf, horn, glass, has, peoples, pictures, on, it, there, are, pictured, a, man, and, three, women, on, it, who, obviously, are, participants, of, a, feast, the, third, female, musician, is, sitting, on, a, chair, with, a, harp, in, her, hands, this, find, proves, that, the, instrument, in, armenia, had, its, armenian, name, in, 4th, century, bc, n, tahmizyan, also, writes, about, this, horn, glass, in, his, book, this, find, is, a, proof, that, armenians, knew, and, even, enjoyed, playing, the, harp, in, 4th, century, bc, on, the, famous, armenian, cilician, silver, glass, a, man, is, painted, surrounded, with, his, lively, wife, and, animals, formerly, the, harp, was, played, in, royal, castles, sometimes, not, only, musicians, but, also, kings, played, the, instrument, of, course, in, the, past, harps, did, not, have, the, sound, range, they, have, today, but, it, is, a, fact, that, armenians, had, the, harp, pictures, of, the, harp, can, be, found, in, people, and, everyday, life, yerevan, 1978, scientific, work, of, astghik, gevorgyan, a, researcher, at, matenadaran, the, mesrop, mashtots, institute, of, ancient, manuscripts, candidate, in, arts, in, her, work, pictures, of, the, instrument, can, be, found, in, the, first, picture, the, man, is, playing, the, harp, which, is, on, his, knees, in, the, second, picture, the, harp, is, played, by, a, man, who, has, a, crown, on, his, head, from, which, we, may, conclude, that, the, musician, has, a, royal, origin, this, harp, is, bigger, and, leans, on, the, floor, not, only, did, armenians, play, the, instrument, but, also, they, created, songs, about, it, kh, avetisyan, and, v, harutyunyan, wrote, a, song, called, my, sweet, harp, which, was, quite, popular, this, analysis, and, researches, with, the, historical, and, archaeological, proofs, led, us, to, the, colnclusion, that, the, instrument, of, harp, existed, and, was, widely, used, in, armenians, everyday, life, including, royal, families, the, instrument, s, popularity, has, grown, during, the, years, and, the, harp, has, become, an, instrument, that, represents, the, emotional, inner, world, of, the, armenians, in, india, the, b, in, baia, harp, survives, about, the, padhar, people, of, madhya, pradesh, the, kafir, harp, has, been, part, of, nuristani, musical, tradition, for, many, years, the, harp, largely, became, extinct, in, east, asia, by, the, 17th, century, around, the, year, 1000, harps, like, the, vajra, began, to, replace, prior, harps, a, few, examples, survived, to, the, modern, era, particularly, myanmar, s, saung, gauk, which, is, considered, the, national, instrument, in, that, country, though, the, ancient, chinese, konghou, has, not, been, directly, resurrected, the, name, has, been, revived, and, applied, to, a, modern, newly, invented, instrument, based, on, the, western, classical, harp, but, with, the, strings, doubled, back, to, form, two, notes, per, string, allowing, advanced, techniques, such, as, note, bending, the, concert, harp, is, a, technologically, advanced, instrument, particularly, distinguished, by, its, use, of, pedals, foot, controlled, levers, which, can, alter, the, pitch, of, given, strings, making, it, chromatic, and, thus, able, to, play, a, wide, body, of, classical, repertoire, the, pedal, harp, contains, seven, pedals, that, each, affect, the, tuning, of, all, strings, of, one, pitch, class, the, pedals, from, left, to, right, are, d, c, b, on, the, left, side, and, e, f, g, a, on, the, right, pedals, were, first, introduced, in, 1697, by, jakob, hochbrucker, of, bavaria, in, 1811, these, were, upgraded, to, the, double, action, pedal, system, patented, by, s, bastien, erard, the, addition, of, pedals, broadened, the, harp, s, abilities, allowing, its, gradual, entry, into, the, classical, orchestra, largely, beginning, in, the, 19th, century, the, harp, played, little, or, no, role, in, early, classical, music, being, used, only, a, handful, of, times, by, major, composers, such, as, mozart, and, beethoven, and, its, usage, by, cesar, franck, in, his, symphony, in, d, minor, 1888, was, described, as, revolutionary, despite, some, body, of, prior, classical, usage, in, the, 20th, century, the, pedal, harp, found, use, outside, of, classical, music, entering, musical, comedy, films, in, 1929, with, arthur, harpo, marx, jazz, with, casper, reardon, in, 1934, the, beatles, 1967, single, she, s, leaving, home, and, several, works, by, bj, rk, which, featured, harpist, zeena, parkins, in, the, early, 1980s, swiss, harpist, andreas, vollenweider, exposed, the, concert, harp, to, large, new, audiences, with, his, popular, new, age, jazz, albums, and, concert, performances, in, the, modern, era, there, is, a, family, of, mid, size, harps, generally, with, nylon, strings, and, optionally, with, partial, or, full, levers, but, without, pedals, they, range, from, two, to, six, octaves, and, are, plucked, with, the, fingers, using, a, similar, technique, to, the, pedal, harp, though, these, harps, evoke, ties, to, historical, european, harps, their, specifics, are, modern, and, they, are, frequently, referred, to, broadly, as, celtic, harps, due, to, their, region, of, revival, and, popular, association, or, more, generically, as, folk, harps, due, to, their, use, in, non, classical, music, or, as, lever, harps, to, contrast, their, modifying, mechanism, with, the, larger, pedal, harp, the, modern, celtic, harp, began, to, appear, in, the, early, 19th, century, in, ireland, contemporary, with, the, dying, out, of, earlier, forms, of, gaelic, harp, dublin, pedal, harp, maker, john, egan, developed, a, new, type, of, harp, which, had, gut, strings, and, semitone, mechanisms, like, an, orchestral, pedal, harp, it, was, small, and, curved, like, the, historical, cl, irseach, or, irish, harp, but, its, strings, were, of, gut, and, the, soundbox, was, much, lighter, in, the, 1890s, a, similar, new, harp, was, also, developed, in, scotland, as, part, of, a, gaelic, cultural, revival, in, the, mid, 20th, century, jord, cochevelou, developed, a, variant, of, the, modern, celtic, harp, which, he, referred, to, as, the, breton, celtic, harp, his, son, alan, stivell, was, to, become, the, most, influential, breton, harper, and, a, strong, influence, in, the, broader, world, of, the, celtic, harp, a, multi, course, harp, is, a, harp, with, more, than, one, row, of, strings, as, opposed, to, the, more, common, single, course, harp, on, a, double, harp, the, two, rows, generally, run, parallel, to, each, other, one, on, either, side, of, the, neck, and, are, usually, both, diatonic, sometimes, with, levers, with, identical, notes, the, triple, harp, originated, in, italy, in, the, 16th, century, and, arrived, in, wales, in, the, late, 17th, century, where, it, established, itself, in, the, local, tradition, as, the, welsh, harp, telyn, deires, three, row, harp, the, triple, consists, of, two, outer, rows, of, identical, diatonic, strings, with, a, third, set, of, chromatic, strings, between, them, these, strings, are, off, set, to, permit, the, harpist, to, reach, past, the, outer, row, and, pluck, an, inner, string, if, a, chromatic, note, is, needed, some, harps, rather, than, using, pedal, or, lever, devices, achieve, chromaticity, by, simply, adding, additional, strings, to, cover, the, notes, outside, their, diatonic, home, scale, the, welsh, triple, harp, is, one, such, instrument, and, two, other, instruments, employing, this, technique, are, the, cross, strung, harp, and, the, inline, chromatic, harp, the, cross, strung, harp, has, one, row, of, diatonic, strings, and, a, separate, row, of, chromatic, notes, angled, in, an, x, shape, so, that, the, row, which, can, be, played, by, the, right, hand, at, the, top, may, be, played, by, the, left, hand, at, the, bottom, and, vice, versa, this, variant, was, first, attested, as, the, arpa, de, dos, rdenes, two, row, harp, in, spain, and, portugal, in, the, 17th, century, the, inline, chromatic, harp, is, generally, a, single, course, harp, with, all, 12, notes, of, the, chromatic, scale, appearing, in, a, single, row, single, course, inline, chromatic, harps, have, been, produced, at, least, since, 1902, when, karl, weigel, of, hanover, patented, a, model, of, inline, chromatic, harp, amplified, electro, acoustic, hollow, body, and, solid, body, electric, lever, harps, are, produced, by, many, harp, makers, including, lyon, healy, salvi, and, camac, they, generally, use, individual, piezo, electric, sensors, for, each, string, often, in, combination, with, small, internal, microphones, to, produce, a, mixed, electrical, signal, hollow, body, instruments, can, also, be, played, acoustically, while, solid, body, instruments, must, be, amplified, the, late, 20th, century, gravikord, is, a, modern, purpose, built, electric, double, harp, made, of, stainless, steel, based, on, the, traditional, west, african, kora, harps, vary, globally, in, many, ways, in, terms, of, size, many, smaller, harps, can, be, played, on, the, lap, whereas, larger, harps, are, quite, heavy, and, rest, on, the, floor, different, harps, may, use, strings, of, catgut, nylon, metal, or, some, combination, all, harps, have, a, neck, resonator, and, strings, frame, harps, or, triangular, harps, have, a, pillar, at, their, long, end, to, support, the, strings, while, open, harps, such, as, arch, harps, and, bow, harps, do, not, modern, harps, also, vary, in, techniques, used, to, extend, the, range, and, chromaticism, of, the, strings, e, g, adding, sharps, and, flats, on, lever, harps, one, adjusts, a, string, s, note, mid, performance, by, flipping, a, lever, which, shortens, the, string, enough, to, raise, the, pitch, by, a, chromatic, sharp, on, pedal, harps, depressing, the, pedal, one, step, turns, geared, levers, on, the, strings, for, all, octaves, of, a, single, pitch, most, allow, a, second, step, that, turns, a, second, set, of, levers, the, pedal, harp, is, a, standard, instrument, in, the, orchestra, of, the, romantic, music, era, ca, 1800, 1910, ce, and, the, 20th, and, 21st, century, music, era, harps, are, essentially, triangular, and, made, primarily, of, wood, strings, are, made, of, gut, or, wire, often, replaced, in, the, modern, day, by, nylon, or, metal, the, top, end, of, each, string, is, secured, on, the, crossbar, or, neck, where, each, will, have, a, tuning, peg, or, similar, device, to, adjust, the, pitch, from, the, crossbar, the, string, runs, down, to, the, sounding, board, on, the, resonating, body, where, it, is, secured, with, a, knot, on, modern, harps, the, string, s, hole, is, protected, with, an, eyelet, to, limit, wear, on, the, wood, the, distance, between, the, tuning, peg, and, the, soundboard, as, well, as, tension, and, weight, of, the, string, determine, the, pitch, of, the, string, the, body, is, hollow, and, when, a, taut, string, is, plucked, the, body, resonates, projecting, sound, the, longest, side, of, the, harp, is, called, the, column, or, pillar, though, some, earlier, harps, such, as, a, bow, harp, lack, a, pillar, on, most, harps, the, sole, purpose, of, the, pillar, is, to, hold, up, the, neck, against, the, great, strain, of, the, strings, on, harps, which, have, pedals, largely, the, modern, concert, harp, the, pillar, is, a, hollow, column, and, encloses, the, rods, which, adjust, the, pitches, which, are, levered, by, pressing, pedals, at, the, base, of, the, instrument, on, harps, of, earlier, design, a, single, string, produces, only, a, single, pitch, unless, it, is, retuned, in, many, cases, this, means, such, a, harp, can, only, play, in, one, key, at, a, time, and, must, be, retuned, to, play, in, another, key, harpers, and, luthiers, have, developed, various, remedies, to, this, limitation, these, solutions, increase, the, versatility, of, a, harp, at, the, cost, of, adding, complexity, weight, and, expense, the, modern, english, word, harp, comes, from, the, old, english, hearpe, akin,
