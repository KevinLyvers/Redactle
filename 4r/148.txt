trace, their, roots, back, to, ancient, and, medieval, arabic, sanskrit, persian, and, mesopotamian, literature, most, tales, however, were, originally, folk, stories, from, the, abbasid, and, mamluk, eras, while, others, especially, the, frame, story, are, probably, drawn, from, the, pahlavi, persian, work, hez, r, afs, n, persian, lit, a, thousand, tales, which, in, turn, may, be, translations, of, older, indian, texts, common, to, all, the, editions, of, the, nights, is, the, framing, device, of, the, story, of, the, ruler, shahryar, being, narrated, the, tales, by, his, wife, scheherazade, with, one, tale, told, over, each, night, of, storytelling, the, stories, proceed, from, this, original, tale, some, are, framed, within, other, tales, while, some, are, self, contained, some, editions, contain, only, a, few, hundred, nights, of, storytelling, while, others, include, 1001, or, more, the, bulk, of, the, text, is, in, prose, although, verse, is, occasionally, used, for, songs, and, riddles, and, to, express, heightened, emotion, most, of, the, poems, are, single, couplets, or, quatrains, although, some, are, longer, some, of, the, stories, commonly, associated, with, the, arabian, nights, particularly, aladdin, and, the, wonderful, lamp, and, ali, baba, and, the, forty, thieves, were, not, part, of, the, collection, in, the, original, arabic, versions, but, were, instead, added, to, the, collection, by, french, translator, antoine, galland, after, he, heard, them, from, syrian, writer, hanna, diyab, during, the, latter, s, visit, to, paris, other, stories, such, as, the, seven, voyages, of, sinbad, the, sailor, had, an, independent, existence, before, being, added, to, the, collection, the, main, frame, story, concerns, shahry, r, whom, the, narrator, calls, a, sasanian, king, ruling, in, india, and, china, shahry, r, is, shocked, to, learn, that, his, brother, s, wife, is, unfaithful, discovering, that, his, own, wife, s, infidelity, has, been, even, more, flagrant, he, has, her, killed, in, his, bitterness, and, grief, he, decides, that, all, women, are, the, same, shahry, r, begins, to, marry, a, succession, of, virgins, only, to, execute, each, one, the, next, morning, before, she, has, a, chance, to, dishonor, him, eventually, the, vizier, wazir, whose, duty, it, is, to, provide, them, cannot, find, any, more, virgins, scheherazade, the, vizier, s, daughter, offers, herself, as, the, next, bride, and, her, father, reluctantly, agrees, on, the, night, of, their, marriage, scheherazade, begins, to, tell, the, king, a, tale, but, does, not, end, it, the, king, curious, about, how, the, story, ends, is, thus, forced, to, postpone, her, execution, in, order, to, hear, the, conclusion, the, next, night, as, soon, as, she, finishes, the, tale, she, begins, another, one, and, the, king, eager, to, hear, the, conclusion, of, that, tale, as, well, postpones, her, execution, once, again, this, goes, on, for, one, thousand, and, one, nights, hence, the, name, the, tales, vary, widely, they, include, historical, tales, love, stories, tragedies, comedies, poems, burlesques, and, various, forms, of, erotica, numerous, stories, depict, jinn, ghouls, ape, people, sorcerers, magicians, and, legendary, places, which, are, often, intermingled, with, real, people, and, geography, not, always, rationally, common, protagonists, include, the, historical, abbasid, caliph, harun, al, rashid, his, grand, vizier, jafar, al, barmaki, and, the, famous, poet, abu, nuwas, despite, the, fact, that, these, figures, lived, some, 200, years, after, the, fall, of, the, sassanid, empire, in, which, the, frame, tale, of, scheherazade, is, set, sometimes, a, character, in, scheherazade, s, tale, will, begin, telling, other, characters, a, story, of, their, own, and, that, story, may, have, another, one, told, within, it, resulting, in, a, richly, layered, narrative, texture, versions, differ, at, least, in, detail, as, to, final, endings, in, some, scheherazade, asks, for, a, pardon, in, some, the, king, sees, their, children, and, decides, not, to, execute, his, wife, in, some, other, things, happen, that, make, the, king, distracted, but, they, all, end, with, the, king, giving, his, wife, a, pardon, and, sparing, her, life, the, narrator, s, standards, for, what, constitutes, a, cliffhanger, seem, broader, than, in, modern, literature, while, in, many, cases, a, story, is, cut, off, with, the, hero, in, danger, of, losing, their, life, or, another, kind, of, deep, trouble, in, some, parts, of, the, full, text, scheherazade, stops, her, narration, in, the, middle, of, an, exposition, of, abstract, philosophical, principles, or, complex, points, of, islamic, philosophy, and, in, one, case, during, a, detailed, description, of, human, anatomy, according, to, galen, and, in, all, of, these, cases, she, turns, out, to, be, justified, in, her, belief, that, the, king, s, curiosity, about, the, sequel, would, buy, her, another, day, of, life, a, number, of, stories, within, the, one, thousand, and, one, nights, also, feature, science, fiction, elements, one, example, is, the, adventures, of, bulukiya, where, the, protagonist, bulukiya, s, quest, for, the, herb, of, immortality, leads, him, to, explore, the, seas, journey, to, the, garden, of, eden, and, to, jahannam, and, travel, across, the, cosmos, to, different, worlds, much, larger, than, his, own, world, anticipating, elements, of, galactic, science, fiction, along, the, way, he, encounters, societies, of, jinns, mermaids, talking, serpents, talking, trees, and, other, forms, of, life, in, another, arabian, nights, tale, the, protagonist, abdullah, the, fisherman, gains, the, ability, to, breathe, underwater, and, discovers, an, underwater, submarine, society, that, is, portrayed, as, an, inverted, reflection, of, society, on, land, in, that, the, underwater, society, follows, a, form, of, primitive, communism, where, concepts, like, money, and, clothing, do, not, exist, other, arabian, nights, tales, deal, with, lost, ancient, technologies, advanced, ancient, civilizations, that, went, astray, and, catastrophes, which, overwhelmed, them, the, city, of, brass, features, a, group, of, travellers, on, an, archaeological, expedition, across, the, sahara, to, find, an, ancient, lost, city, and, attempt, to, recover, a, brass, vessel, that, solomon, once, used, to, trap, a, jinn, and, along, the, way, encounter, a, mummified, queen, petrified, inhabitants, life, like, humanoid, robots, and, automata, seductive, marionettes, dancing, without, strings, and, a, brass, horseman, robot, who, directs, the, party, towards, the, ancient, city, the, ebony, horse, features, a, robot, in, the, form, of, a, flying, mechanical, horse, controlled, using, keys, that, could, fly, into, outer, space, and, towards, the, sun, while, the, third, qalandar, s, tale, also, features, a, robot, in, the, form, of, an, uncanny, boatman, the, city, of, brass, and, the, ebony, horse, can, be, considered, early, examples, of, proto, science, fiction, the, history, of, the, nights, is, extremely, complex, and, modern, scholars, have, made, many, attempts, to, untangle, the, story, of, how, the, collection, as, it, currently, exists, came, about, robert, irwin, summarises, their, findings, in, the, 1880s, and, 1890s, a, lot, of, work, was, done, on, the, nights, by, zotenberg, and, others, in, the, course, of, which, a, consensus, view, of, the, history, of, the, text, emerged, most, scholars, agreed, that, the, nights, was, a, composite, work, and, that, the, earliest, tales, in, it, came, from, india, and, persia, at, some, time, probably, in, the, early, eighth, century, these, tales, were, translated, into, arabic, under, the, title, alf, layla, or, the, thousand, nights, this, collection, then, formed, the, basis, of, the, thousand, and, one, nights, the, original, core, of, stories, was, quite, small, then, in, iraq, in, the, ninth, or, tenth, century, this, original, core, had, arab, stories, added, to, it, among, them, some, tales, about, the, caliph, harun, al, rashid, also, perhaps, from, the, tenth, century, onwards, previously, independent, sagas, and, story, cycles, were, added, to, the, compilation, then, from, the, 13th, century, onwards, a, further, layer, of, stories, was, added, in, syria, and, egypt, many, of, these, showing, a, preoccupation, with, sex, magic, or, low, life, in, the, early, modern, period, yet, more, stories, were, added, to, the, egyptian, collections, so, as, to, swell, the, bulk, of, the, text, sufficiently, to, bring, its, length, up, to, the, full, 1, 001, nights, of, storytelling, promised, by, the, book, s, title, devices, found, in, sanskrit, literature, such, as, frame, stories, and, animal, fables, are, seen, by, some, scholars, as, lying, at, the, root, of, the, conception, of, the, nights, the, motif, of, the, wise, young, woman, who, delays, and, finally, removes, an, impending, danger, by, telling, stories, has, been, traced, back, to, indian, sources, indian, folklore, is, represented, in, the, nights, by, certain, animal, stories, which, reflect, influence, from, ancient, sanskrit, fables, the, influence, of, the, panchatantra, and, baital, pachisi, is, particularly, notable, it, is, possible, that, the, influence, of, the, panchatantra, is, via, a, sanskrit, adaptation, called, the, tantropakhyana, only, fragments, of, the, original, sanskrit, form, of, the, tantropakhyana, survive, but, translations, or, adaptations, exist, in, tamil, lao, thai, and, old, javanese, the, frame, story, follows, the, broad, outline, of, a, concubine, telling, stories, in, order, to, maintain, the, interest, and, favour, of, a, king, although, the, basis, of, the, collection, of, stories, is, from, the, panchatantra, with, its, original, indian, setting, the, panchatantra, and, various, tales, from, jatakas, were, first, translated, into, persian, by, borz, ya, in, 570, ce, they, were, later, translated, into, arabic, by, ibn, al, muqaffa, in, 750, ce, the, arabic, version, was, translated, into, several, languages, including, syriac, greek, hebrew, and, spanish, the, earliest, mentions, of, the, nights, refer, to, it, as, an, arabic, translation, from, a, persian, book, hez, r, afs, n, also, known, as, afsaneh, or, afsana, meaning, the, thousand, stories, in, the, tenth, century, ibn, al, nadim, compiled, a, catalogue, of, books, the, fihrist, in, baghdad, he, noted, that, the, sassanid, kings, of, iran, enjoyed, evening, tales, and, fables, al, nadim, then, writes, about, the, persian, hez, r, afs, n, explaining, the, frame, story, it, employs, a, bloodthirsty, king, kills, off, a, succession, of, wives, after, their, wedding, night, eventually, one, has, the, intelligence, to, save, herself, by, telling, him, a, story, every, evening, leaving, each, tale, unfinished, until, the, next, night, so, that, the, king, will, delay, her, execution, however, according, to, al, nadim, the, book, contains, only, 200, stories, he, also, writes, disparagingly, of, the, collection, s, literary, quality, observing, that, it, is, truly, a, coarse, book, without, warmth, in, the, telling, in, the, same, century, al, masudi, also, refers, to, the, hez, r, afs, n, saying, the, arabic, translation, is, called, alf, khurafa, a, thousand, entertaining, tales, but, is, generally, known, as, alf, layla, a, thousand, nights, he, mentions, the, characters, shir, zd, scheherazade, and, din, z, d, no, physical, evidence, of, the, hez, r, afs, n, has, survived, so, its, exact, relationship, with, the, existing, later, arabic, versions, remains, a, mystery, apart, from, the, scheherazade, frame, story, several, other, tales, have, persian, origins, although, it, is, unclear, how, they, entered, the, collection, these, stories, include, the, cycle, of, king, jali, ad, and, his, wazir, shimas, and, the, ten, wazirs, or, the, history, of, king, azadbakht, and, his, son, derived, from, the, seventh, century, persian, bakhtiy, rn, ma, in, the, 1950s, the, iraqi, scholar, safa, khulusi, suggested, on, internal, rather, than, historical, evidence, that, the, persian, writer, ibn, al, muqaffa, was, responsible, for, the, first, arabic, translation, of, the, frame, story, and, some, of, the, persian, stories, later, incorporated, into, the, nights, this, would, place, genesis, of, the, collection, in, the, eighth, century, in, the, mid, 20th, century, the, scholar, nabia, abbott, found, a, document, with, a, few, lines, of, an, arabic, work, with, the, title, the, book, of, the, tale, of, a, thousand, nights, dating, from, the, ninth, century, this, is, the, earliest, known, surviving, fragment, of, the, nights, the, first, reference, to, the, arabic, version, under, its, full, title, the, one, thousand, and, one, nights, appears, in, cairo, in, the, 12th, century, professor, dwight, reynolds, describes, the, subsequent, transformations, of, the, arabic, version, some, of, the, earlier, persian, tales, may, have, survived, within, the, arabic, tradition, altered, such, that, arabic, muslim, names, and, new, locations, were, substituted, for, pre, islamic, persian, ones, but, it, is, also, clear, that, whole, cycles, of, arabic, tales, were, eventually, added, to, the, collection, and, apparently, replaced, most, of, the, persian, materials, one, such, cycle, of, arabic, tales, centres, around, a, small, group, of, historical, figures, from, ninth, century, baghdad, including, the, caliph, harun, al, rashid, died, 809, his, vizier, jafar, al, barmaki, d, 803, and, the, licentious, poet, abu, nuwas, d, c, 813, another, cluster, is, a, body, of, stories, from, late, medieval, cairo, in, which, are, mentioned, persons, and, places, that, date, to, as, late, as, the, thirteenth, and, fourteenth, centuries, two, main, arabic, manuscript, traditions, of, the, nights, are, known, the, syrian, and, the, egyptian, the, syrian, tradition, is, primarily, represented, by, the, earliest, extensive, manuscript, of, the, nights, a, fourteenth, or, fifteenth, century, syrian, manuscript, now, known, as, the, galland, manuscript, it, and, surviving, copies, of, it, are, much, shorter, and, include, fewer, tales, than, the, egyptian, tradition, it, is, represented, in, print, by, the, so, called, calcutta, i, 1814, 1818, and, most, notably, by, the, leiden, edition, 1984, the, leiden, edition, prepared, by, muhsin, mahdi, is, the, only, critical, edition, of, 1001, nights, to, date, believed, to, be, most, stylistically, faithful, representation, of, medieval, arabic, versions, currently, available, texts, of, the, egyptian, tradition, emerge, later, and, contain, many, more, tales, of, much, more, varied, content, a, much, larger, number, of, originally, independent, tales, have, been, incorporated, into, the, collection, over, the, centuries, most, of, them, after, the, galland, manuscript, was, written, and, were, being, included, as, late, as, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, all, extant, substantial, versions, of, both, recensions, share, a, small, common, core, of, tales, the, texts, of, the, syrian, recension, do, not, contain, much, beside, that, core, it, is, debated, which, of, the, arabic, recensions, is, more, authentic, and, closer, to, the, original, the, egyptian, ones, have, been, modified, more, extensively, and, more, recently, and, scholars, such, as, muhsin, mahdi, have, suspected, that, this, was, caused, in, part, by, european, demand, for, a, complete, version, but, it, appears, that, this, type, of, modification, has, been, common, throughout, the, history, of, the, collection, and, independent, tales, have, always, been, added, to, it, the, first, printed, arabic, language, edition, of, the, one, thousand, and, one, nights, was, published, in, 1775, it, contained, an, egyptian, version, of, the, nights, known, as, zer, zotenberg, s, egyptian, recension, and, 200, tales, no, copy, of, this, edition, survives, but, it, was, the, basis, for, an, 1835, edition, by, bulaq, published, by, the, egyptian, government, the, nights, were, next, printed, in, arabic, in, two, volumes, in, calcutta, by, the, british, east, india, company, in, 1814, 1818, each, volume, contained, one, hundred, tales, soon, after, the, prussian, scholar, christian, maximilian, habicht, collaborated, with, the, tunisian, mordecai, ibn, al, najjar, to, create, an, edition, containing, 1001, nights, both, in, the, original, arabic, and, in, german, translation, initially, in, a, series, of, eight, volumes, published, in, breslau, in, 1825, 1838, a, further, four, volumes, followed, in, 1842, 1843, in, addition, to, the, galland, manuscript, habicht, and, al, najjar, used, what, they, believed, to, be, a, tunisian, manuscript, which, was, later, revealed, as, a, forgery, by, al, najjar, both, the, zer, printing, and, habicht, and, al, najjar, s, edition, influenced, the, next, printing, a, four, volume, edition, also, from, calcutta, known, as, the, macnaghten, or, calcutta, ii, edition, this, claimed, to, be, based, on, an, older, egyptian, manuscript, which, has, never, been, found, a, major, recent, edition, which, reverts, to, the, syrian, recension, is, a, critical, edition, based, on, the, fourteenth, or, fifteenth, century, syrian, manuscript, in, the, biblioth, que, nationale, originally, used, by, galland, this, edition, known, as, the, leiden, text, was, compiled, in, arabic, by, muhsin, mahdi, 1984, 1994, mahdi, argued, that, this, version, is, the, earliest, extant, one, a, view, that, is, largely, accepted, today, and, that, it, reflects, most, closely, a, definitive, coherent, text, ancestral, to, all, others, that, he, believed, to, have, existed, during, the, mamluk, period, a, view, that, remains, contentious, still, even, scholars, who, deny, this, version, the, exclusive, status, of, the, only, real, arabian, nights, recognize, it, as, being, the, best, source, on, the, original, style, and, linguistic, form, of, the, medieval, work, in, 1997, a, further, arabic, edition, appeared, containing, tales, from, the, arabian, nights, transcribed, from, a, seventeenth, century, manuscript, in, the, egyptian, dialect, of, arabic, the, first, european, version, 1704, 1717, was, translated, into, french, by, antoine, galland, from, an, arabic, text, of, the, syrian, recension, and, other, sources, this, 12, volume, work, les, mille, et, une, nuits, contes, arabes, traduits, en, fran, ais, the, thousand, and, one, nights, arab, stories, translated, into, french, included, stories, that, were, not, in, the, original, arabic, manuscript, aladdin, s, lamp, and, ali, baba, and, the, forty, thieves, as, well, as, several, other, lesser, known, tales, appeared, first, in, galland, s, translation, and, cannot, be, found, in, any, of, the, original, manuscripts, he, wrote, that, he, heard, them, from, the, christian, maronite, storyteller, hanna, diab, during, diab, s, visit, to, paris, galland, s, version, of, the, nights, was, immensely, popular, throughout, europe, and, later, versions, were, issued, by, galland, s, publisher, using, galland, s, name, without, his, consent, as, scholars, were, looking, for, the, presumed, complete, and, original, form, of, the, nights, they, naturally, turned, to, the, more, voluminous, texts, of, the, egyptian, recension, which, soon, came, to, be, viewed, as, the, standard, version, the, first, translations, of, this, kind, such, as, that, of, edward, lane, 1840, 1859, were, bowdlerized, unabridged, and, unexpurgated, translations, were, made, first, by, john, payne, under, the, title, the, book, of, the, thousand, nights, and, one, night, 1882, nine, volumes, and, then, by, sir, richard, francis, burton, entitled, the, book, of, the, thousand, nights, and, a, night, 1885, ten, volumes, the, latter, was, according, to, some, assessments, partially, based, on, the, former, leading, to, charges, of, plagiarism, in, view, of, the, sexual, imagery, in, the, source, texts, which, burton, emphasized, even, further, especially, by, adding, extensive, footnotes, and, appendices, on, oriental, sexual, mores, and, the, strict, victorian, laws, on, obscene, material, both, of, these, translations, were, printed, as, private, editions, for, subscribers, only, rather, than, published, in, the, usual, manner, burton, s, original, 10, volumes, were, followed, by, a, further, six, seven, in, the, baghdad, edition, and, perhaps, others, entitled, the, supplemental, nights, to, the, thousand, nights, and, a, night, which, were, printed, between, 1886, and, 1888, it, has, however, been, criticized, for, its, archaic, language, and, extravagant, idiom, and, obsessive, focus, on, sexuality, and, has, even, been, called, an, eccentric, ego, trip, and, a, highly, personal, reworking, of, the, text, later, versions, of, the, nights, include, that, of, the, french, doctor, j, c, mardrus, issued, from, 1898, to, 1904, it, was, translated, into, english, by, powys, mathers, and, issued, in, 1923, like, payne, s, and, burton, s, texts, it, is, based, on, the, egyptian, recension, and, retains, the, erotic, material, indeed, expanding, on, it, but, it, has, been, criticized, for, inaccuracy, muhsin, mahdi, s, 1984, leiden, edition, based, on, the, galland, manuscript, was, rendered, into, english, by, husain, haddawy, 1990, this, translation, has, been, praised, as, very, readable, and, strongly, recommended, for, anyone, who, wishes, to, taste, the, authentic, flavour, of, those, tales, an, additional, second, volume, of, arabian, nights, translated, by, haddawy, composed, of, popular, tales, not, present, in, the, leiden, edition, was, published, in, 1995, both, volumes, were, the, basis, for, a, single, volume, reprint, of, selected, tales, of, haddawy, s, translations, a, new, english, translation, was, published, by, penguin, classics, in, three, volumes, in, 2008, it, is, translated, by, malcolm, c, lyons, and, ursula, lyons, with, introduction, and, annotations, by, robert, irwin, this, is, the, first, complete, translation, of, the, macnaghten, or, calcutta, ii, edition, egyptian, recension, since, burton, s, it, contains, in, addition, to, the, standard, text, of, 1001, nights, the, so, called, orphan, stories, of, aladdin, and, ali, baba, as, well, as, an, alternative, ending, to, the, seventh, journey, of, sindbad, from, antoine, galland, s, original, french, as, the, translator, himself, notes, in, his, preface, to, the, three, volumes, o, attempt, has, been, made, to, superimpose, on, the, translation, changes, that, would, be, needed, to, rectify, accretions, repetitions, non, sequiturs, and, confusions, that, mark, the, present, text, and, the, work, is, a, representation, of, what, is, primarily, oral, literature, appealing, to, the, ear, rather, than, the, eye, the, lyons, translation, includes, all, the, poetry, in, plain, prose, paraphrase, but, does, not, attempt, to, reproduce, in, english, the, internal, rhyming, of, some, prose, sections, of, the, original, arabic, moreover, it, streamlines, somewhat, and, has, cuts, in, this, sense, it, is, not, as, claimed, a, complete, translation, this, translation, was, generally, well, received, upon, release, a, new, english, language, translation, was, published, in, december, 2021, the, first, solely, by, a, female, author, yasmine, seale, which, removes, earlier, sexist, and, racist, references, the, new, translation, includes, all, the, tales, from, hanna, diyab, and, additionally, includes, stories, previously, omitted, featuring, female, protagonists, such, as, tales, about, parizade, pari, banu, and, the, horror, story, sidi, numan, scholars, have, assembled, a, timeline, concerning, the, publication, history, of, the, nights, the, one, thousand, and, one, nights, and, various, tales, within, it, make, use, of, many, innovative, literary, techniques, which, the, storytellers, of, the, tales, rely, on, for, increased, drama, suspense, or, other, emotions, some, of, these, date, back, to, earlier, persian, indian, and, arabic, literature, while, others, were, original, to, the, one, thousand, and, one, nights, the, one, thousand, and, one, nights, employs, an, early, example, of, the, frame, story, or, framing, device, the, character, scheherazade, narrates, a, set, of, tales, most, often, fairy, tales, to, the, sultan, shahriyar, over, many, nights, many, of, scheherazade, s, tales, are, themselves, frame, stories, such, as, the, tale, of, sinbad, the, seaman, and, sinbad, the, landsman, which, is, a, collection, of, adventures, related, by, sinbad, the, seaman, to, sinbad, the, landsman, in, folkloristics, the, frame, story, is, classified, as, atu, 875b, storytelling, saves, a, wife, from, death, another, technique, featured, in, the, one, thousand, and, one, nights, is, an, early, example, of, the, story, within, a, story, or, embedded, narrative, technique, this, can, be, traced, back, to, earlier, persian, and, indian, storytelling, traditions, most, notably, the, panchatantra, of, ancient, sanskrit, literature, the, nights, however, improved, on, the, panchatantra, in, several, ways, particularly, in, the, way, a, story, is, introduced, in, the, panchatantra, stories, are, introduced, as, didactic, analogies, with, the, frame, story, referring, to, these, stories, with, variants, of, the, phrase, if, you, re, not, careful, that, which, happened, to, the, louse, and, the, flea, will, happen, to, you, in, the, nights, this, didactic, framework, is, the, least, common, way, of, introducing, the, story, instead, a, story, is, most, commonly, introduced, through, subtle, means, particularly, as, an, answer, to, questions, raised, in, a, previous, tale, the, general, story, is, narrated, by, an, unknown, narrator, and, in, this, narration, the, stories, are, told, by, scheherazade, in, most, of, scheherazade, s, narrations, there, are, also, stories, narrated, and, even, in, some, of, these, there, are, some, other, stories, this, is, particularly, the, case, for, the, sinbad, the, sailor, story, narrated, by, scheherazade, in, the, one, thousand, and, one, nights, within, the, sinbad, the, sailor, story, itself, the, protagonist, sinbad, the, sailor, narrates, the, stories, of, his, seven, voyages, to, sinbad, the, porter, the, device, is, also, used, to, great, effect, in, stories, such, as, the, three, apples, and, the, seven, viziers, in, yet, another, tale, scheherazade, narrates, the, fisherman, and, the, jinni, the, tale, of, the, wazir, and, the, sage, duban, is, narrated, within, it, and, within, that, there, are, three, more, tales, narrated, dramatic, visualization, is, the, representing, of, an, object, or, character, with, an, abundance, of, descriptive, detail, or, the, mimetic, rendering, of, gestures, and, dialogue, in, such, a, way, as, to, make, a, given, scene, visual, or, imaginatively, present, to, an, audience, this, technique, is, used, in, several, tales, of, the, one, thousand, and, one, nights, such, as, the, tale, of, the, three, apples, see, crime, fiction, elements, below, a, common, theme, in, many, arabian, nights, tales, is, fate, and, destiny, italian, filmmaker, pier, paolo, pasolini, observed, very, tale, in, the, thousand, and, one, nights, begins, with, an, appearance, of, destiny, which, manifests, itself, through, an, anomaly, and, one, anomaly, always, generates, another, so, a, chain, of, anomalies, is, set, up, and, the, more, logical, tightly, knit, essential, this, chain, is, the, more, beautiful, the, tale, by, beautiful, i, mean, vital, absorbing, and, exhilarating, the, chain, of, anomalies, always, tends, to, lead, back, to, normality, the, end, of, every, tale, in, the, one, thousand, and, one, nights, consists, of, a, disappearance, of, destiny, which, sinks, back, to, the, somnolence, of, daily, life, the, protagonist, of, the, stories, is, in, fact, destiny, itself, though, invisible, fate, may, be, considered, a, leading, character, in, the, one, thousand, and, one, nights, the, plot, devices, often, used, to, present, this, theme, are, coincidence, reverse, causation, and, the, self, fulfilling, prophecy, see, foreshadowing, section, below, early, examples, of, the, foreshadowing, technique, of, repetitive, designation, now, known, as, chekhov, s, gun, occur, in, the, one, thousand, and, one, nights, which, contains, repeated, references, to, some, character, or, object, which, appears, insignificant, when, first, mentioned, but, which, reappears, later, to, intrude, suddenly, in, the, narrative, a, notable, example, is, in, the, tale, of, the, three, apples, see, crime, fiction, elements, below, another, early, foreshadowing, technique, is, formal, patterning, the, organization, of, the, events, actions, and, gestures, which, constitute, a, narrative, and, give, shape, to, a, story, when, done, well, formal, patterning, allows, the, audience, the, pleasure, of, discerning, and, anticipating, the, structure, of, the, plot, as, it, unfolds, this, technique, is, also, found, in, one, thousand, and, one, nights, several, tales, in, the, one, thousand, and, one, nights, use, the, self, fulfilling, prophecy, as, a, special, form, of, literary, prolepsis, to, foreshadow, what, is, going, to, happen, this, literary, device, dates, back, to, the, story, of, krishna, in, ancient, sanskrit, literature, and, oedipus, or, the, death, of, heracles, in, the, plays, of, sophocles, a, variation, of, this, device, is, the, self, fulfilling, dream, which, can, be, found, in, arabic, literature, or, the, dreams, of, joseph, and, his, conflicts, with, his, brothers, in, the, hebrew, bible, a, notable, example, is, the, ruined, man, who, became, rich, again, through, a, dream, in, which, a, man, is, told, in, his, dream, to, leave, his, native, city, of, baghdad, and, travel, to, cairo, where, he, will, discover, the, whereabouts, of, some, hidden, treasure, the, man, travels, there, and, experiences, misfortune, ending, up, in, jail, where, he, tells, his, dream, to, a, police, officer, the, officer, mocks, the, idea, of, foreboding, dreams, and, tells, the, protagonist, that, he, himself, had, a, dream, about, a, house, with, a, courtyard, and, fountain, in, baghdad, where, treasure, is, buried, under, the, fountain, the, man, recognizes, the, place, as, his, own, house, and, after, he, is, released, from, jail, he, returns, home, and, digs, up, the, treasure, in, other, words, the, foreboding, dream, not, only, predicted, the, future, but, the, dream, was, the, cause, of, its, prediction, coming, true, a, variant, of, this, story, later, appears, in, english, folklore, as, the, pedlar, of, swaffham, and, paulo, coelho, s, the, alchemist, jorge, luis, borges, collection, of, short, stories, a, universal, history, of, infamy, featured, his, translation, of, this, particular, story, into, spanish, as, the, story, of, the, two, dreamers, the, tale, of, attaf, depicts, another, variation, of, the, self, fulfilling, prophecy, whereby, harun, al, rashid, consults, his, library, the, house, of, wisdom, reads, a, random, book, falls, to, laughing, and, weeping, and, dismisses, the, faithful, vizier, ja, far, ibn, yahya, from, sight, ja, afar, disturbed, and, upset, flees, baghdad, and, plunges, into, a, series, of, adventures, in, damascus, involving, attaf, and, the, woman, whom, attaf, eventually, marries, after, returning, to, baghdad, ja, afar, reads, the, same, book, that, caused, harun, to, laugh, and, weep, and, discovers, that, it, describes, his, own, adventures, with, attaf, in, other, words, it, was, harun, s, reading, of, the, book, that, provoked, the, adventures, described, in, the, book, to, take, place, this, is, an, early, example, of, reverse, causation, near, the, end, of, the, tale, attaf, is, given, a, death, sentence, for, a, crime, he, did, not, commit, but, harun, knowing, the, truth, from, what, he, has, read, in, the, book, prevents, this, and, has, attaf, released, from, prison, in, the, 12th, century, this, tale, was, translated, into, latin, by, petrus, alphonsi, and, included, in, his, disciplina, clericalis, alongside, the, sindibad, story, cycle, in, the, 14th, century, a, version, of, the, tale, of, attaf, also, appears, in, the, gesta, romanorum, and, giovanni, boccaccio, s, the, decameron, leitwortstil, is, the, purposeful, repetition, of, words, in, a, given, literary, piece, that, usually, expresses, a, motif, or, theme, important, to, the, given, story, this, device, occurs, in, the, one, thousand, and, one, nights, which, binds, several, tales, in, a, story, cycle, the, storytellers, of, the, tales, relied, on, this, technique, to, shape, the, constituent, members, of, their, story, cycles, into, a, coherent, whole, another, technique, used, in, the, one, thousand, and, one, nights, is, thematic, patterning, which, is, he, distribution, of, recurrent, thematic, concepts, and, moralistic, motifs, among, the, various, incidents, and, frames, of, a, story, in, a, skillfully, crafted, tale, thematic, patterning, may, be, arranged, so, as, to, emphasize, the, unifying, argument, or, salient, idea, which, disparate, events, and, disparate, frames, have, in, common, several, different, variants, of, the, cinderella, story, which, has, its, origins, in, the, ancient, greek, story, of, rhodopis, appear, in, the, one, thousand, and, one, nights, including, the, second, shaykh, s, story, the, eldest, lady, s, tale, and, abdallah, ibn, fadil, and, his, brothers, all, dealing, with, the, theme, of, a, younger, sibling, harassed, by, two, jealous, elders, in, some, of, these, the, siblings, are, female, while, in, others, they, are, male, one, of, the, tales, judar, and, his, brethren, departs, from, the, happy, endings, of, previous, variants, and, reworks, the, plot, to, give, it, a, tragic, ending, instead, with, the, younger, brother, being, poisoned, by, his, elder, brothers, the, nights, contain, many, examples, of, sexual, humour, some, of, this, borders, on, satire, as, in, the, tale, called, ali, with, the, large, member, which, pokes, fun, at, obsession, with, penis, size, the, literary, device, of, the, unreliable, narrator, was, used, in, several, fictional, medieval, arabic, tales, of, the, one, thousand, and, one, nights, in, one, tale, the, seven, viziers, also, known, as, craft, and, malice, of, women, or, the, tale, of, the, king, his, son, his, concubine, and, the, seven, wazirs, a, courtesan, accuses, a, king, s, son, of, having, assaulted, her, when, in, reality, she, had, failed, to, seduce, him, inspired, by, the, qur, anic, biblical, story, of, yusuf, joseph, seven, viziers, attempt, to, save, his, life, by, narrating, seven, stories, to, prove, the, unreliability, of, women, and, the, courtesan, responds, by, narrating, a, story, to, prove, the, unreliability, of, viziers, the, unreliable, narrator, device, is, also, used, to, generate, suspense, in, the, three, apples, and, humor, in, the, hunchback, s, tale, see, crime, fiction, elements, below, an, example, of, the, murder, mystery, and, suspense, thriller, genres, in, the, collection, with, multiple, plot, twists, and, detective, fiction, elements, was, the, three, apples, also, known, as, hikayat, al, sabiyya, l, maqtula, the, tale, of, the, murdered, young, woman, in, this, tale, harun, al, rashid, comes, to, possess, a, chest, which, when, opened, contains, the, body, of, a, young, woman, harun, gives, his, vizier, ja, far, three, days, to, find, the, culprit, or, be, executed, at, the, end, of, three, days, when, ja, far, is, about, to, be, executed, for, his, failure, two, men, come, forward, both, claiming, to, be, the, murderer, as, they, tell, their, story, it, transpires, that, although, the, younger, of, them, the, woman, s, husband, was, responsible, for, her, death, some, of, the, blame, attaches, to, a, slave, who, had, taken, one, of, the, apples, mentioned, in, the, title, and, caused, the, woman, s, murder, harun, then, gives, ja, far, three, more, days, to, find, the, guilty, slave, when, he, yet, again, fails, to, find, the, culprit, and, bids, his, family, goodbye, before, his, execution, he, discovers, by, chance, his, daughter, has, the, apple, which, she, obtained, from, ja, far, s, own, slave, rayhan, thus, the, mystery, is, solved, another, nights, tale, with, crime, fiction, elements, was, the, hunchback, s, tale, story, cycle, which, unlike, the, three, apples, was, more, of, a, suspenseful, comedy, and, courtroom, drama, rather, than, a, murder, mystery, or, detective, fiction, the, story, is, set, in, a, fictional, china, and, begins, with, a, hunchback, the, emperor, s, favourite, comedian, being, invited, to, dinner, by, a, tailor, couple, the, hunchback, accidentally, chokes, on, his, food, from, laughing, too, hard, and, the, couple, fearful, that, the, emperor, will, be, furious, take, his, body, to, a, jewish, doctor, s, clinic, and, leave, him, there, this, leads, to, the, next, tale, in, the, cycle, the, tale, of, the, jewish, doctor, where, the, doctor, accidentally, trips, over, the, hunchback, s, body, falls, down, the, stairs, with, him, and, finds, him, dead, leading, him, to, believe, that, the, fall, had, killed, him, the, doctor, then, dumps, his, body, down, a, chimney, and, this, leads, to, yet, another, tale, in, the, cycle, which, continues, with, twelve, tales, in, total, leading, to, all, the, people, involved, in, this, incident, finding, themselves, in, a, courtroom, all, making, different, claims, over, how, the, hunchback, had, died, crime, fiction, elements, are, also, present, near, the, end, of, the, tale, of, attaf, see, foreshadowing, above, haunting, is, used, as, a, plot, device, in, gothic, fiction, and, horror, fiction, as, well, as, modern, paranormal, fiction, legends, about, haunted, houses, have, long, appeared, in, literature, in, particular, the, arabian, nights, tale, of, ali, the, cairene, and, the, haunted, house, in, baghdad, revolves, around, a, house, haunted, by, jinn, the, nights, is, almost, certainly, the, earliest, surviving, literature, that, mentions, ghouls, and, many, of, the, stories, in, that, collection, involve, or, reference, ghouls, a, prime, example, is, the, story, the, history, of, gherib, and, his, brother, agib, from, nights, vol, 6, in, which, gherib, an, outcast, prince, fights, off, a, family, of, ravenous, ghouls, and, then, enslaves, them, and, converts, them, to, islam, horror, fiction, elements, are, also, found, in, the, city, of, brass, tale, which, revolves, around, a, ghost, town, the, horrific, nature, of, scheherazade, s, situation, is, magnified, in, stephen, king, s, misery, in, which, the, protagonist, is, forced, to, write, a, novel, to, keep, his, captor, from, torturing, and, killing, him, the, influence, of, the, nights, on, modern, horror, fiction, is, certainly, discernible, in, the, work, of, h, p, lovecraft, as, a, child, he, was, fascinated, by, the, adventures, recounted, in, the, book, and, he, attributes, some, of, his, creations, to, his, love, of, the, 1001, nights, several, stories, within, the, one, thousand, and, one, nights, feature, early, science, fiction, elements, one, example, is, the, adventures, of, bulukiya, in, which, the, protagonist, bulukiya, s, quest, for, the, herb, of, immortality, leads, him, to, explore, the, seas, journey, to, paradise, and, to, hell, and, travel, across, the, cosmos, to, different, worlds, much, larger, than, his, own, world, anticipating, elements, of, galactic, science, fiction, along, the, way, he, encounters, societies, of, jinn, mermaids, talking, serpents, talking, trees, and, other, forms, of, life, in, abu, al, husn, and, his, slave, girl, tawaddud, the, heroine, tawaddud, gives, an, impromptu, lecture, on, the, mansions, of, the, moon, and, the, benevolent, and,

breathe, underwater, and, discovers, an, underwater, society, that, is, portrayed, as, an, inverted, reflection, of, society, on, land, in, that, the, underwater, society, follows, a, form, of, primitive, communism, where, concepts, like, money, and, clothing, do, not, exist, other, arabian, nights, tales, also, depict, amazon, societies, dominated, by, women, lost, ancient, technologies, advanced, ancient, civilizations, that, went, astray, and, catastrophes, which, overwhelmed, them, the, city, of, brass, features, a, group, of, travellers, on, an, archaeological, expedition, across, the, sahara, to, find, an, ancient, lost, city, and, attempt, to, recover, a, brass, vessel, that, solomon, once, used, to, trap, a, jinni, and, along, the, way, encounter, a, mummified, queen,

city, which, has, now, become, a, ghost, town, the, third, qalandar, s, tale, also, features, a, robot, in, the, form, of, an, uncanny, boatman, there, is, an, abundance, of, arabic, poetry, in, one, thousand, and, one, nights, it, is, often, deployed, by, stories, narrators, to, provide, detailed, descriptions, usually, of, the, beauty, of, characters, characters, also, occasionally, quote, or, speak, in, verse, in, certain, settings, the, uses, include, but, are, not, limited, to, in, a, typical, example, expressing, feelings, of, happiness, to, oneself, from, night, 203, prince, qamar, al,

ali, baba, part, of, its, popularity, may, have, sprung, from, improved, standards, of, historical, and, geographical, knowledge, the, marvelous, beings, and, events, typical, of, fairy, tales, seem, less, incredible, if, they, are, set, further, long, ago, or, farther, far, away, this, process, culminates, in, the, fantasy, world, having, little, connection, if, any, to, actual, times, and, places, several, elements, from, arabian, mythology, are, now, common, in, modern, fantasy, such, as, genies, bahamuts, magic, carpets, magic, lamps, etc, when, l, frank, baum, proposed, writing, a, modern, fairy, tale, that, banished, stereotypical, elements, he, included, the, genie, as, well, as, the, dwarf, and, the, fairy, as, stereotypes, to, go, in, 1982, the, international, astronomical, union, iau, began, naming, features, on, saturn, s, moon, enceladus, after, characters, and, places, in, burton, s, translation, because, its, surface, is, so, strange, and, mysterious, that, it, was, given, the, arabian, nights, as, a, name, bank, linking, fantasy, landscape, with, a, literary, fantasy, there, is, little, evidence, that, the, nights, was, particularly, treasured, in, the, arab, world, it, is, rarely, mentioned, in, lists, of, popular, literature, and, few, pre, 18th, century, manuscripts, of, the, collection, exist, fiction, had, a, low, cultural, status, among, medieval, arabs, compared, with, poetry, and, the, tales, were, dismissed, as, khurafa, improbable, fantasies, fit, only, for, entertaining, women, and, children, according, to, robert, irwin, even, today, with, the, exception, of, certain, writers, and, academics, the, nights, is, regarded, with, disdain, in, the, arabic, world, its, stories, are, regularly, denounced, as, vulgar, improbable, childish, and, above, all, badly, written, nevertheless, the, nights, have, proved, an, inspiration, to, some, modern, egyptian, writers, such, as, tawfiq, al, hakim, author, of, the, symbolist, play, shahrazad, 1934, taha, hussein, scheherazade, s, dreams, 1943, and, naguib, mahfouz, arabian, nights, and, days, 1979, idries, shah, finds, the, abjad, numerical, equivalent, of, the, arabic, title,

enjoyed, long, lasting, popularity, in, arabic, speaking, countries, although, the, first, known, translation, into, a, european, language, appeared, in, 1704, it, is, possible, that, the, nights, began, exerting, its, influence, on, western, culture, much, earlier, christian, writers, in, medieval, spain, translated, many, works, from, arabic, mainly, philosophy, and, mathematics, but, also, arab, fiction, as, is, evidenced, by, juan, manuel, s, story, collection, el, conde, lucanor, and, ram, n, llull, s, the, book, of, beasts, knowledge, of, the, work, direct, or, indirect, apparently, spread, beyond, spain, themes, and, motifs, with, parallels, in, the, nights, are, found, in, chaucer, s, the, canterbury, tales, in, the, squire, s, tale, the, hero, travels, on, a, flying, brass, horse, and, boccaccio, s, decameron, echoes, in, giovanni, sercambi, s, novelle, and, ariosto, s, orlando, furioso, suggest, that, the, story, of, shahriyar, and, shahzaman, was, also, known, evidence, also, appears, to, show, that, the, stories, had, spread, to, the, balkans, and, a, translation, of, the, nights, into, romanian, existed, by, the, 17th, century, itself, based, on, a, greek, version, of, the, collection, the, modern, fame, of, the, nights, derives, from, the, first, known, european, translation, by, antoine, galland, which, appeared, in, 1704, according, to, robert, irwin, galland, played, so, large, a, part, in, discovering, the, tales, in, popularizing, them, in, europe, and, in, shaping, what, would, come, to, be, regarded, as, the, canonical, collection, that, at, some, risk, of, hyperbole, and, paradox, he, has, been, called, the, real, author, of, the, nights, the, immediate, success, of, galland, s, version, with, the, french, public, may, have, been, because, it, coincided, with, the, vogue, for, contes, de, f, es, fairy, stories, this, fashion, began, with, the, publication, of, madame, d, aulnoy, s, histoire, d, hypolite, in, 1690, d, aulnoy, s, book, has, a, remarkably, similar, structure, to, the, nights, with, the, tales, told, by, a, female, narrator, the, success, of, the, nights, spread, across, europe, and, by, the,
