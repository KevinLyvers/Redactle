https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bassoon
the, bassoon, is, a, musical, instrument, in, the, woodwind, family, which, plays, in, the, tenor, and, bass, ranges, it, is, composed, of, six, pieces, and, is, usually, made, of, wood, it, is, known, for, its, distinctive, tone, color, wide, range, versatility, and, virtuosity, it, is, a, non, transposing, instrument, and, typically, its, music, is, written, in, the, bass, and, tenor, clefs, and, sometimes, in, the, treble, there, are, two, forms, of, modern, bassoon, the, buffet, or, french, and, heckel, or, german, systems, it, is, typically, played, while, sitting, using, a, seat, strap, but, can, be, played, while, standing, if, the, player, has, a, harness, to, hold, the, instrument, sound, is, produced, by, rolling, both, lips, over, the, reed, and, blowing, direct, air, pressure, to, cause, the, reed, to, vibrate, its, fingering, system, can, be, quite, complex, when, compared, to, those, of, other, instruments, appearing, in, its, modern, form, in, the, 19th, century, the, bassoon, figures, prominently, in, orchestral, concert, band, and, chamber, music, literature, and, is, occasionally, heard, in, pop, rock, and, jazz, settings, as, well, one, who, plays, a, bassoon, is, called, a, bassoonist, plucked, the, word, bassoon, comes, from, french, basson, and, from, italian, bassone, basso, with, the, augmentative, suffix, one, however, the, italian, name, for, the, same, instrument, is, fagotto, in, spanish, dutch, danish, czech, polish, serbo, croatian, and, romanian, it, is, fagot, and, in, german, fagott, fagot, is, an, old, french, word, meaning, a, bundle, of, sticks, the, dulcian, came, to, be, known, as, fagotto, in, italy, however, the, usual, etymology, that, equates, fagotto, with, bundle, of, sticks, is, somewhat, misleading, as, the, latter, term, did, not, come, into, general, use, until, later, however, an, early, english, variation, faget, was, used, as, early, as, 1450, to, refer, to, firewood, which, is, 100, years, before, the, earliest, recorded, use, of, the, dulcian, 1550, further, citation, is, needed, to, prove, the, lack, of, relation, between, the, meaning, bundle, of, sticks, and, fagotto, italian, or, variants, some, think, that, it, may, resemble, the, roman, fasces, a, standard, of, bound, sticks, with, an, axe, a, further, discrepancy, lies, in, the, fact, that, the, dulcian, was, carved, out, of, a, single, block, of, wood, in, other, words, a, single, stick, and, not, a, bundle, the, range, of, the, bassoon, begins, at, b, 1, the, first, one, below, the, bass, staff, and, extends, upward, over, three, octaves, roughly, to, the, g, above, the, treble, staff, g, 5, however, most, writing, for, bassoon, rarely, calls, for, notes, above, c, 5, or, d, 5, even, stravinsky, s, opening, solo, in, the, rite, of, spring, only, ascends, to, d, 5, notes, higher, than, this, are, possible, but, seldom, written, as, they, are, difficult, to, produce, often, requiring, specific, reed, design, features, to, ensure, reliability, and, at, any, rate, are, quite, homogeneous, in, timbre, to, the, same, pitches, on, cor, anglais, which, can, produce, them, with, relative, ease, french, bassoon, has, greater, facility, in, the, extreme, high, register, and, so, repertoire, written, for, it, is, somewhat, likelier, to, include, very, high, notes, although, repertoire, for, french, system, can, be, executed, on, german, system, without, alterations, and, vice, versa, the, extensive, high, register, of, the, bassoon, and, its, frequent, role, as, a, lyric, tenor, have, meant, that, tenor, clef, is, very, commonly, employed, in, its, literature, after, the, baroque, partly, to, avoid, excessive, ledger, lines, and, beginning, in, the, 20th, century, treble, clef, is, also, seen, for, similar, reasons, like, other, woodwind, instruments, the, lowest, note, is, fixed, but, a, 1, is, possible, with, a, special, extension, to, the, instrument, see, extended, techniques, below, although, the, primary, tone, hole, pitches, are, a, pitched, perfect, 5th, lower, than, other, non, transposing, western, woodwinds, effectively, an, octave, beneath, english, horn, the, bassoon, is, non, transposing, meaning, that, notes, sounded, match, the, written, pitch, the, bassoon, disassembles, into, six, main, pieces, including, the, reed, the, bell, 6, extending, upward, the, bass, joint, or, long, joint, 5, connecting, the, bell, and, the, boot, the, boot, or, butt, 4, at, the, bottom, of, the, instrument, and, folding, over, on, itself, the, wing, joint, or, tenor, joint, 3, which, extends, from, boot, to, bocal, and, the, bocal, or, crook, 2, a, crooked, metal, tube, that, attaches, the, wing, joint, to, a, reed, 1, listen, the, bore, of, the, bassoon, is, conical, like, that, of, the, oboe, and, the, saxophone, and, the, two, adjoining, bores, of, the, boot, joint, are, connected, at, the, bottom, of, the, instrument, with, a, u, shaped, metal, connector, both, bore, and, tone, holes, are, precision, machined, and, each, instrument, is, finished, by, hand, for, proper, tuning, the, walls, of, the, bassoon, are, thicker, at, various, points, along, the, bore, here, the, tone, holes, are, drilled, at, an, angle, to, the, axis, of, the, bore, which, reduces, the, distance, between, the, holes, on, the, exterior, this, ensures, coverage, by, the, fingers, of, the, average, adult, hand, playing, is, facilitated, by, closing, the, distance, between, the, widely, spaced, holes, with, a, complex, system, of, key, work, which, extends, throughout, nearly, the, entire, length, of, the, instrument, the, overall, height, of, the, bassoon, stretches, to, 1, 34, m, 4, ft, 5, in, tall, but, the, total, sounding, length, is, 2, 54, m, 8, ft, 4, in, considering, that, the, tube, is, doubled, back, on, itself, there, are, also, short, reach, bassoons, made, for, the, benefit, of, young, or, petite, players, a, modern, beginner, s, bassoon, is, generally, made, of, maple, with, medium, hardness, types, such, as, sycamore, maple, and, sugar, maple, preferred, less, expensive, models, are, also, made, of, materials, such, as, polypropylene, and, ebonite, primarily, for, student, and, outdoor, use, metal, bassoons, were, made, in, the, past, but, have, not, been, produced, by, any, major, manufacturer, since, 1889, the, art, of, reed, making, has, been, practiced, for, several, hundred, years, some, of, the, earliest, known, reeds, having, been, made, for, the, dulcian, a, predecessor, of, the, bassoon, current, methods, of, reed, making, consist, of, a, set, of, basic, methods, however, individual, bassoonists, playing, styles, vary, greatly, and, thus, require, that, reeds, be, customized, to, best, suit, their, respective, bassoonist, advanced, players, usually, make, their, own, reeds, to, this, end, with, regards, to, commercially, made, reeds, many, companies, and, individuals, offer, pre, made, reeds, for, sale, but, players, often, find, that, such, reeds, still, require, adjustments, to, suit, their, particular, playing, style, modern, bassoon, reeds, made, of, arundo, donax, cane, are, often, made, by, the, players, themselves, although, beginner, bassoonists, tend, to, buy, their, reeds, from, professional, reed, makers, or, use, reeds, made, by, their, teachers, reeds, begin, with, a, length, of, tube, cane, that, is, split, into, three, or, four, pieces, using, a, tool, called, a, cane, splitter, the, cane, is, then, trimmed, and, gouged, to, the, desired, thickness, leaving, the, bark, attached, after, soaking, the, gouged, cane, is, cut, to, the, proper, shape, and, milled, to, the, desired, thickness, or, profiled, by, removing, material, from, the, bark, side, this, can, be, done, by, hand, with, a, file, more, frequently, it, is, done, with, a, machine, or, tool, designed, for, the, purpose, after, the, profiled, cane, has, soaked, once, again, it, is, folded, over, in, the, middle, prior, to, soaking, the, reed, maker, will, have, lightly, scored, the, bark, with, parallel, lines, with, a, knife, this, ensures, that, the, cane, will, assume, a, cylindrical, shape, during, the, forming, stage, on, the, bark, portion, the, reed, maker, binds, on, one, two, or, three, coils, or, loops, of, brass, wire, to, aid, in, the, final, forming, process, the, exact, placement, of, these, loops, can, vary, somewhat, depending, on, the, reed, maker, the, bound, reed, blank, is, then, wrapped, with, thick, cotton, or, linen, thread, to, protect, it, and, a, conical, steel, mandrel, which, sometimes, has, been, heated, in, a, flame, is, quickly, inserted, in, between, the, blades, using, a, special, pair, of, pliers, the, reed, maker, presses, down, the, cane, making, it, conform, to, the, shape, of, the, mandrel, the, steam, generated, by, the, heated, mandrel, causes, the, cane, to, permanently, assume, the, shape, of, the, mandrel, the, upper, portion, of, the, cavity, thus, created, is, called, the, throat, and, its, shape, has, an, influence, on, the, final, playing, characteristics, of, the, reed, the, lower, mostly, cylindrical, portion, will, be, reamed, out, with, a, special, tool, called, a, reamer, allowing, the, reed, to, fit, on, the, bocal, after, the, reed, has, dried, the, wires, are, tightened, around, the, reed, which, has, shrunk, after, drying, or, replaced, completely, the, lower, part, is, sealed, a, nitrocellulose, based, cement, such, as, duco, may, be, used, and, then, wrapped, with, thread, to, ensure, both, that, no, air, leaks, out, through, the, bottom, of, the, reed, and, that, the, reed, maintains, its, shape, the, wrapping, itself, is, often, sealed, with, duco, or, clear, nail, varnish, polish, electrical, tape, can, also, be, used, as, a, wrapping, for, amateur, reed, makers, the, bulge, in, the, wrapping, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, turk, s, head, it, serves, as, a, convenient, handle, when, inserting, the, reed, on, the, bocal, alternatively, hot, glue, epoxy, or, heat, shrink, wrap, may, be, used, to, seal, the, tube, of, the, reed, the, thread, wrapping, commonly, known, as, a, turban, due, to, the, criss, crossing, fabric, is, still, more, common, in, commercially, sold, reeds, to, finish, the, reed, the, end, of, the, reed, blank, originally, at, the, center, of, the, unfolded, piece, of, cane, is, cut, off, creating, an, opening, the, blades, above, the, first, wire, are, now, roughly, 27, 30, mm, 1, 1, 1, 2, in, long, for, the, reed, to, play, a, slight, bevel, must, be, created, at, the, tip, with, a, knife, although, there, is, also, a, machine, that, can, perform, this, function, other, adjustments, with, the, reed, knife, may, be, necessary, depending, on, the, hardness, the, profile, of, the, cane, and, the, requirements, of, the, player, the, reed, opening, may, also, need, to, be, adjusted, by, squeezing, either, the, first, or, second, wire, with, the, pliers, additional, material, may, be, removed, from, the, sides, the, channels, or, tip, to, balance, the, reed, additionally, if, the, e, in, the, bass, clef, staff, is, sagging, in, pitch, it, may, be, necessary, to, clip, the, reed, by, removing, 1, 2, mm, 0, 039, 0, 079, in, from, its, length, using, a, pair, of, very, sharp, scissors, or, the, equivalent, music, historians, generally, consider, the, dulcian, to, be, the, forerunner, of, the, modern, bassoon, as, the, two, instruments, share, many, characteristics, a, double, reed, fitted, to, a, metal, crook, obliquely, drilled, tone, holes, and, a, conical, bore, that, doubles, back, on, itself, the, origins, of, the, dulcian, are, obscure, but, by, the, mid, 16th, century, it, was, available, in, as, many, as, eight, different, sizes, from, soprano, to, great, bass, a, full, consort, of, dulcians, was, a, rarity, its, primary, function, seems, to, have, been, to, provide, the, bass, in, the, typical, wind, band, of, the, time, either, loud, shawms, or, soft, recorders, indicating, a, remarkable, ability, to, vary, dynamics, to, suit, the, need, otherwise, dulcian, technique, was, rather, primitive, with, eight, finger, holes, and, two, keys, indicating, that, it, could, play, in, only, a, limited, number, of, key, signatures, circumstantial, evidence, indicates, that, the, baroque, bassoon, was, a, newly, invented, instrument, rather, than, a, simple, modification, of, the, old, dulcian, the, dulcian, was, not, immediately, supplanted, but, continued, to, be, used, well, into, the, 18th, century, by, bach, and, others, and, presumably, for, reasons, of, interchangeability, repertoire, from, this, time, is, very, unlikely, to, go, beyond, the, smaller, compass, of, the, dulcian, the, man, most, likely, responsible, for, developing, the, true, bassoon, was, martin, hotteterre, d, 1712, who, may, also, have, invented, the, three, piece, fl, te, traversi, re, transverse, flute, and, the, hautbois, baroque, oboe, some, historians, believe, that, sometime, in, the, 1650s, hotteterre, conceived, the, bassoon, in, four, sections, bell, bass, joint, boot, and, wing, joint, an, arrangement, that, allowed, greater, accuracy, in, machining, the, bore, compared, to, the, one, piece, dulcian, he, also, extended, the, compass, down, to, b, by, adding, two, keys, an, alternate, view, maintains, hotteterre, was, one, of, several, craftsmen, responsible, for, the, development, of, the, early, bassoon, these, may, have, included, additional, members, of, the, hotteterre, family, as, well, as, other, french, makers, active, around, the, same, time, no, original, french, bassoon, from, this, period, survives, but, if, it, did, it, would, most, likely, resemble, the, earliest, extant, bassoons, of, johann, christoph, denner, and, richard, haka, from, the, 1680s, sometime, around, 1700, a, fourth, key, g, was, added, and, it, was, for, this, type, of, instrument, that, composers, such, as, antonio, vivaldi, bach, and, georg, philipp, telemann, wrote, their, demanding, music, a, fifth, key, for, the, low, e, was, added, during, the, first, half, of, the, 18th, century, notable, makers, of, the, 4, key, and, 5, key, baroque, bassoon, include, j, h, eichentopf, c, 1678, 1769, j, poerschmann, 1680, 1757, thomas, stanesby, jr, 1668, 1734, g, h, scherer, 1703, 1778, and, prudent, thieriot, 1732, 1786, increasing, demands, on, capabilities, of, instruments, and, players, in, the, 19th, century, particularly, larger, concert, halls, requiring, greater, volume, and, the, rise, of, virtuoso, composer, performers, spurred, further, refinement, increased, sophistication, both, in, manufacturing, techniques, and, acoustical, knowledge, made, possible, great, improvements, in, the, instrument, s, playability, the, modern, bassoon, exists, in, two, distinct, primary, forms, the, buffet, or, french, system, and, the, heckel, german, system, most, of, the, world, plays, the, heckel, system, while, the, buffet, system, is, primarily, played, in, france, belgium, and, parts, of, latin, america, a, number, of, other, types, of, bassoons, have, been, constructed, by, various, instrument, makers, such, as, the, rare, galandronome, owing, to, the, ubiquity, of, the, heckel, system, in, english, speaking, countries, references, in, english, to, the, contemporary, bassoon, always, mean, the, heckel, system, with, the, buffet, system, being, explicitly, qualified, where, it, appears, the, design, of, the, modern, bassoon, owes, a, great, deal, to, the, performer, teacher, and, composer, carl, almenr, der, assisted, by, the, german, acoustic, researcher, gottfried, weber, he, developed, the, 17, key, bassoon, with, a, range, spanning, four, octaves, almenr, der, s, improvements, to, the, bassoon, began, with, an, 1823, treatise, describing, ways, of, improving, intonation, response, and, technical, ease, of, playing, by, augmenting, and, rearranging, the, keywork, subsequent, articles, further, developed, his, ideas, his, employment, at, schott, gave, him, the, freedom, to, construct, and, test, instruments, according, to, these, new, designs, and, he, published, the, results, in, caecilia, schott, s, house, journal, almenr, der, continued, publishing, and, building, instruments, until, his, death, in, 1846, and, ludwig, van, beethoven, himself, requested, one, of, the, newly, made, instruments, after, hearing, of, the, papers, in, 1831, almenr, der, left, schott, to, start, his, own, factory, with, a, partner, johann, adam, heckel, heckel, and, two, generations, of, descendants, continued, to, refine, the, bassoon, and, their, instruments, became, the, standard, with, other, makers, following, because, of, their, superior, singing, tone, quality, an, improvement, upon, one, of, the, main, drawbacks, of, the, almenr, der, instruments, the, heckel, instruments, competed, for, prominence, with, the, reformed, wiener, system, a, boehm, style, bassoon, and, a, completely, keyed, instrument, devised, by, charles, joseph, sax, father, of, adolphe, sax, f, w, kruspe, implemented, a, latecomer, attempt, in, 1893, to, reform, the, fingering, system, but, it, failed, to, catch, on, other, attempts, to, improve, the, instrument, included, a, 24, keyed, model, and, a, single, reed, mouthpiece, but, both, these, had, adverse, effects, on, tone, and, were, abandoned, coming, into, the, 20th, century, the, heckel, style, german, model, of, bassoon, dominated, the, field, heckel, himself, had, made, over, 1, 100, instruments, by, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, serial, numbers, begin, at, 3, 000, and, the, british, makers, instruments, were, no, longer, desirable, for, the, changing, pitch, requirements, of, the, symphony, orchestra, remaining, primarily, in, military, band, use, except, for, a, brief, 1940s, wartime, conversion, to, ball, bearing, manufacture, the, heckel, concern, has, produced, instruments, continuously, to, the, present, day, heckel, bassoons, are, considered, by, many, to, be, the, best, although, a, range, of, heckel, style, instruments, is, available, from, several, other, manufacturers, all, with, slightly, different, playing, characteristics, because, its, mechanism, is, primitive, compared, to, most, modern, woodwinds, makers, have, occasionally, attempted, to, reinvent, the, bassoon, in, the, 1960s, giles, brindley, began, to, develop, what, he, called, the, logical, bassoon, which, aimed, to, improve, intonation, and, evenness, of, tone, through, use, of, an, electrically, activated, mechanism, making, possible, key, combinations, too, complex, for, the, human, hand, to, manage, brindley, s, logical, bassoon, was, never, marketed, the, buffet, system, bassoon, achieved, its, basic, acoustical, properties, somewhat, earlier, than, the, heckel, thereafter, it, continued, to, develop, in, a, more, conservative, manner, while, the, early, history, of, the, heckel, bassoon, included, a, complete, overhaul, of, the, instrument, in, both, acoustics, and, key, work, the, development, of, the, buffet, system, consisted, primarily, of, incremental, improvements, to, the, key, work, this, minimalist, approach, of, the, buffet, deprived, it, of, improved, consistency, of, intonation, ease, of, operation, and, increased, power, which, is, found, in, heckel, bassoons, but, the, buffet, is, considered, by, some, to, have, a, more, vocal, and, expressive, quality, the, conductor, john, foulds, lamented, in, 1934, the, dominance, of, the, heckel, style, bassoon, considering, them, too, homogeneous, in, sound, with, the, horn, the, modern, buffet, system, has, 22, keys, with, its, range, being, the, same, as, the, heckel, although, buffet, instruments, have, greater, facility, in, the, upper, registers, reaching, e, 5, and, f, 5, with, far, greater, ease, and, less, air, resistance, compared, to, the, heckel, bassoon, buffet, system, bassoons, have, a, narrower, bore, and, simpler, mechanism, requiring, different, and, often, more, complex, fingerings, for, many, notes, switching, between, heckel, and, buffet, or, vice, versa, requires, extensive, retraining, french, woodwind, instruments, tone, in, general, exhibits, a, certain, amount, of, edge, with, more, of, a, vocal, quality, than, is, usual, elsewhere, and, the, buffet, bassoon, is, no, exception, this, sound, has, been, utilised, effectively, in, writing, for, buffet, bassoon, but, is, less, inclined, to, blend, than, the, tone, of, the, heckel, bassoon, as, with, all, bassoons, the, tone, varies, considerably, depending, on, individual, instrument, reed, and, performer, in, the, hands, of, a, lesser, player, the, heckel, bassoon, can, sound, flat, and, woody, but, good, players, succeed, in, producing, a, vibrant, singing, tone, conversely, a, poorly, played, buffet, can, sound, buzzy, and, nasal, but, good, players, succeed, in, producing, a, warm, expressive, sound, though, the, united, kingdom, once, favored, the, french, system, buffet, system, instruments, are, no, longer, made, there, and, the, last, prominent, british, player, of, the, french, system, retired, in, the, 1980s, however, with, continued, use, in, some, regions, and, its, distinctive, tone, the, buffet, continues, to, have, a, place, in, modern, bassoon, playing, particularly, in, france, where, it, originated, buffet, model, bassoons, are, currently, made, in, paris, by, buffet, crampon, and, the, atelier, ducasse, romainville, france, the, selmer, company, stopped, fabrication, of, french, system, bassoons, around, the, year, 2012, some, players, for, example, the, late, gerald, corey, in, canada, have, learned, to, play, both, types, and, will, alternate, between, them, depending, on, the, repertoire, prior, to, 1760, the, early, ancestor, of, the, bassoon, was, the, dulcian, it, was, used, to, reinforce, the, bass, line, in, wind, ensembles, called, consorts, however, its, use, in, concert, orchestras, was, sporadic, until, the, late, 17th, century, when, double, reeds, began, to, make, their, way, into, standard, instrumentation, increasing, use, of, the, dulcian, as, a, basso, continuo, instrument, meant, that, it, began, to, be, included, in, opera, orchestras, in, works, such, as, those, by, reinhard, keiser, and, jean, baptiste, lully, meanwhile, as, the, dulcian, advanced, technologically, and, was, able, to, achieve, more, virtuosity, composers, such, as, joseph, bodin, de, boismortier, johann, ernst, galliard, johann, friedrich, fasch, and, georg, philipp, telemann, wrote, demanding, solo, and, ensemble, music, for, the, instrument, antonio, vivaldi, brought, it, to, prominence, by, featuring, it, in, thirty, nine, concerti, while, the, bassoon, was, still, often, used, to, give, clarity, to, the, bassline, due, to, its, sonorous, low, register, the, capabilities, of, wind, instruments, grew, as, technology, advanced, during, the, classical, era, this, allowed, the, instrument, to, play, in, more, keys, than, the, dulcian, joseph, haydn, took, advantage, of, this, in, his, symphony, no, 45, farewell, symphony, in, which, the, bassoon, plays, in, f, sharp, minor, following, with, these, advances, composers, also, began, to, exploit, the, bassoon, for, its, unique, color, flexibility, and, virtuosic, ability, rather, than, for, its, perfunctory, ability, to, double, the, bass, line, those, who, did, this, include, ludwig, van, beethoven, in, his, three, duos, for, clarinet, and, bassoon, woo, 27, for, clarinet, and, bassoon, and, niccolo, paganini, in, his, duets, for, violin, and, bassoon, in, his, bassoon, concerto, in, b, flat, major, k, 191, w, a, mozart, utilized, all, aspects, of, the, bassoon, s, expressiveness, with, its, contrasts, in, register, staccato, playing, and, expressive, sound, and, was, especially, noted, for, its, singing, quality, in, the, second, movement, this, concerto, is, often, considered, one, of, the, most, important, works, in, all, of, the, bassoon, s, repertoire, even, today, the, bassoon, s, similarity, to, the, human, voice, in, addition, to, its, newfound, virtuosic, ability, was, another, quality, many, composers, took, advantage, of, during, the, classical, era, after, 1730, the, german, bassoon, s, range, expended, up, to, b, 4, and, much, higher, with, the, french, instrument, technological, advances, also, caused, the, bassoon, s, tenor, register, sound, to, become, more, resonant, and, playing, in, this, register, grew, in, popularity, especially, in, the, austro, germanic, musical, world, pedagogues, such, as, josef, frohlich, instructed, students, to, practice, scales, thirds, and, fourths, as, vocal, students, would, in, 1829, he, wrote, that, the, bassoon, was, capable, of, expressing, the, worthy, the, virile, the, solemn, the, great, the, sublime, composure, mildness, intimacy, emotion, longing, heartfulness, reverence, and, soulful, ardour, in, g, f, brandt, s, performance, of, carl, maria, von, weber, s, concerto, for, bassoon, in, f, major, op, 75, j, 127, it, was, also, likened, to, the, human, voice, in, france, pierre, cugnier, described, the, bassoon, s, role, as, encompassing, not, only, the, bass, part, but, also, to, accompany, the, voice, and, harp, play, in, pairs, with, clarinets, and, horns, in, harmonie, and, to, play, in, nearly, all, types, of, music, including, concerti, which, were, much, more, common, than, the, sonatas, of, the, previous, era, both, cugnier, and, tienne, ozi, emphasized, the, importance, of, the, bassoon, s, similarity, to, the, singing, voice, the, role, of, the, bassoon, in, the, orchestra, varied, depending, on, the, country, in, the, viennese, orchestra, the, instrument, offered, a, three, dimensional, sound, to, the, ensemble, by, doubling, other, instruments, such, as, violins, as, heard, in, mozart, s, overture, to, the, marriage, of, figaro, k, 492, where, it, plays, a, rather, technical, part, alongside, the, strings, he, also, wrote, for, the, bassoon, to, change, its, timbre, depending, on, which, instrument, it, was, paired, with, warmer, with, clarinets, hollow, with, flutes, and, dark, and, dignified, with, violins, in, germany, and, scandinavian, countries, orchestras, typically, featured, only, two, bassoons, but, in, france, orchestras, increased, the, number, to, four, in, the, latter, half, of, the, nineteenth, century, in, england, the, bassoonist, s, role, varied, depending, on, the, ensemble, johann, christian, bach, wrote, two, concertos, for, solo, bassoon, and, it, also, appeared, in, more, supportive, roles, such, as, accompanying, church, choirs, after, the, puritan, revolution, destroyed, most, church, organs, in, the, american, colonies, the, bassoon, was, typically, seen, in, a, chamber, setting, after, the, revolutionary, war, bassoonists, were, found, in, wind, bands, that, gave, public, performances, by, 1800, there, was, at, least, one, bassoon, in, the, united, states, marine, band, in, south, america, the, bassoon, also, appeared, in, small, orchestras, bands, and, military, musique, similar, to, harmonie, ensembles, the, role, of, the, bassoon, during, the, romantic, era, varied, between, a, role, as, a, supportive, bass, instrument, and, a, role, as, a, virtuosic, expressive, solo, instrument, in, fact, it, was, very, much, considered, an, instrument, that, could, be, used, in, almost, any, circumstance, the, comparison, of, the, bassoon, s, sound, to, the, human, voice, continued, on, during, this, time, as, much, of, the, pedagogy, surrounded, emulating, this, sound, giuseppe, verdi, used, the, instrument, s, lyrical, singing, voice, to, evoke, emotion, in, pieces, such, as, his, messa, da, requiem, eugene, jancourt, compared, the, use, of, vibrato, on, the, bassoon, to, that, of, singers, and, luigi, orselli, wrote, that, the, bassoon, blended, well, with, human, voice, he, also, noted, the, function, of, the, bassoon, in, the, french, orchestra, at, the, time, which, served, to, support, the, sound, of, the, viola, reinforce, staccato, sound, and, double, the, bass, clarinet, flute, and, oboe, emphasis, also, began, to, be, placed, on, the, unique, sound, of, the, bassoon, s, staccato, which, might, be, described, as, quite, short, and, aggressive, such, as, in, hector, berlioz, s, symphonie, fantastique, op, 14, in, the, fifth, movement, paul, dukas, utilized, the, staccato, to, depict, the, image, of, two, brooms, coming, to, life, in, the, sorcerer, s, apprentice, it, was, common, for, there, to, be, only, two, bassoons, in, german, orchestras, austrian, and, british, military, bands, also, only, carried, two, bassoons, and, were, mainly, used, for, accompaniment, and, offbeat, playing, in, france, hector, berlioz, also, made, it, fashionable, to, use, more, than, two, bassoons, he, often, scored, for, three, or, four, and, at, time, wrote, for, up, to, eight, such, as, in, his, l, imp, riale, at, this, point, composers, expected, bassoons, to, be, as, virtuosic, as, the, other, wind, instruments, as, they, often, wrote, solos, challenging, the, range, and, technique, of, the, instrument, examples, of, this, include, nikolai, rimsky, korsakov, s, bassoon, solo, and, cadenza, following, the, clarinet, in, sheherazade, op, 35, and, in, richard, wagner, s, tannh, user, which, required, the, bassoonist, to, triple, tongue, and, also, play, up, to, the, top, of, its, range, at, an, e, 5, wagner, also, used, the, bassoon, for, its, staccato, ability, in, his, work, and, often, wrote, his, three, bassoon, parts, in, thirds, to, evoke, a, darker, sound, with, noticeable, tone, color, in, modest, mussorgsky, s, night, on, bald, mountain, the, bassoons, play, fortissimo, alongside, other, bass, instruments, in, order, to, evoke, the, voice, of, the, devil, at, this, point, in, time, the, development, of, the, bassoon, slowed, rather, than, making, large, leaps, in, technological, improvements, tiny, imperfections, in, the, instrument, s, function, were, corrected, the, instrument, became, quite, versatile, throughout, the, twentieth, century, the, instrument, was, at, this, point, able, to, play, three, octaves, a, variety, of, different, trills, and, maintained, stable, intonation, across, all, registers, and, dynamic, levels, the, pedagogy, among, bassoonists, varied, among, different, countries, and, so, the, overall, instrument, itself, played, a, variety, of, roles, as, was, a, common, theme, in, previous, eras, the, bassoon, was, valued, by, composers, for, its, unique, voice, and, its, use, rose, higher, in, pitch, a, famous, example, of, this, is, the, beginning, of, igor, stravinsky, s, rite, of, spring, in, which, the, bassoon, plays, in, its, highest, register, in, order, to, mimic, the, russian, dentsivka, composers, also, wrote, for, the, bassoon, s, middle, register, such, as, in, stravinsky, s, berceuse, in, the, firebird, and, symphony, no, 5, in, e, flat, major, op, 82, by, jean, sibelius, they, also, continued, to, highlight, the, staccato, sound, of, the, bassoon, as, heard, in, sergei, prokofiev, s, humorous, scherzo, in, sergei, prokofiev, s, peter, and, the, wolf, the, part, of, the, grandfather, is, played, by, the, bassoon, in, orchestral, settings, most, orchestras, from, the, beginning, of, the, twentieth, century, to, the, present, have, three, or, four, bassoonists, with, the, fourth, typically, covering, contrabassoon, as, well, greater, emphasis, on, the, use, of, timbre, vibrato, and, phrasing, began, to, appear, in, bassoon, pedagogy, and, many, followed, marcel, tabuteau, s, philosophy, on, musical, phrasing, vibrato, began, to, be, used, in, ensemble, playing, depending, on, the, phrasing, of, the, music, the, bassoon, was, and, currently, is, expected, to, be, fluent, with, other, woodwinds, in, terms, of, virtuosity, and, technique, examples, of, this, include, the, cadenza, for, bassoons, in, maurice, ravel, s, rapsodie, espagnole, and, the, multi, finger, trills, used, in, stravinsky, s, octet, in, the, twentieth, century, the, bassoon, was, less, of, a, concerto, soloist, and, when, it, was, the, accompanying, ensemble, was, made, softer, and, quieter, in, addition, it, was, no, longer, used, in, marching, bands, though, still, existed, in, concert, bands, with, one, or, two, of, them, orchestral, repertoire, remained, very, much, the, same, austro, germanic, tradition, throughout, most, western, countries, it, mostly, appeared, in, solo, chamber, and, symphonic, settings, by, the, mid, 1900s, broadcasting, and, recording, grew, in, popularity, allowing, for, new, opportunities, for, bassoonists, and, leading, to, a, slow, decline, of, live, performances, much, of, the, new, music, for, bassoon, in, the, late, twentieth, and, early, twenty, first, centuries, often, included, extended, techniques, and, was, written, for, solo, or, chamber, settings, one, piece, that, included, extended, techniques, was, luciano, berio, s, sequenza, xii, which, called, for, microtonal, fingerings, glissandos, and, timbral, trills, double, and, triple, tonguing, flutter, tonguing, multiphonics, quarter, tones, and, singing, are, all, utilized, in, bruno, bartolozzi, s, concertazioni, there, were, also, a, variety, of, concerti, and, bassoon, and, piano, pieces, written, such, as, john, williams, s, five, sacred, trees, and, andr, previn, s, sonata, for, bassoon, and, piano, there, were, also, performance, pieces, such, as, peter, schickele, s, sonata, abassoonata, which, required, the, bassoonist, to, be, both, a, musician, and, an, actor, the, bassoon, quartet, became, prominent, at, this, time, with, pieces, such, as, daniel, dorff, s, it, takes, four, to, tango, the, bassoon, is, infrequently, used, as, a, jazz, instrument, and, rarely, seen, in, a, jazz, ensemble, it, first, began, appearing, in, the, 1920s, when, garvin, bushell, began, incorporating, the, bassoon, in, his, performances, specific, calls, for, its, use, occurred, in, paul, whiteman, s, group, the, unusual, octets, of, alec, wilder, and, a, few, other, session, appearances, the, next, few, decades, saw, the, instrument, used, only, sporadically, as, symphonic, jazz, fell, out, of, favor, but, the, 1960s, saw, artists, such, as, yusef, lateef, and, chick, corea, incorporate, bassoon, into, their, recordings, lateef, s, diverse, and, eclectic, instrumentation, saw, the, bassoon, as, a, natural, addition, see, e, g, the, centaur, and, the, phoenix, 1960, which, features, bassoon, as, part, of, a, 6, man, horn, section, including, a, few, solos, while, corea, employed, the, bassoon, in, combination, with, flautist, hubert, laws, more, recently, illinois, jacquet, ray, pizzi, frank, tiberi, and, marshall, allen, have, both, doubled, on, bassoon, in, addition, to, their, saxophone, performances, bassoonist, karen, borca, a, performer, of, free, jazz, is, one, of, the, few, jazz, musicians, to, play, only, bassoon, michael, rabinowitz, the, spanish, bassoonist, javier, abad, and, james, lassen, an, american, resident, in, bergen, norway, are, others, katherine, young, plays, the, bassoon, in, the, ensembles, of, anthony, braxton, lindsay, cooper, paul, hanson, the, brazilian, bassoonist, alexandre, silv, rio, trent, jacobs, and, daniel, smith, are, also, currently, using, the, bassoon, in, jazz, french, bassoonists, jean, jacques, decreux, and, alexandre, ouzounoff, have, both, recorded, jazz, exploiting, the, flexibility, of, the, buffet, system, instrument, to, good, effect, in, conjunction, with, the, use, of, electronic, pickups, and, amplification, the, instrument, began, to, be, used, more, somewhat, in, jazz, and, rock, settings, however, the, bassoon, is, still, quite, rare, as, a, regular, member, of, rock, bands, several, 1960s, pop, music, hits, feature, the, bassoon, including, the, tears, of, a, clown, by, smokey, robinson, and, the, miracles, the, bassoonist, was, charles, r, sirard, jennifer, juniper, by, donovan, 59th, street, bridge, song, by, harpers, bizarre, and, the, oompah, bassoon, underlying, the, new, vaudeville, band, s, winchester, cathedral, from, 1974, to, 1978, the, bassoon, was, played, by, lindsay, cooper, in, the, british, avant, garde, band, henry, cow, the, leonard, nimoy, song, the, ballad, of, bilbo, baggins, features, the, bassoon, in, the, 1970s, it, was, played, in, the, british, medieval, progressive, rock, band, gryphon, by, brian, gulland, as, well, as, by, the, american, band, ambrosia, where, it, was, played, by, drummer, burleigh, drummond, the, belgian, rock, in, opposition, band, univers, zero, is, also, known, for, its, use, of, the, bassoon, more, recently, these, new, puritans, s, 2010, album, hidden, makes, heavy, use, of, the, instrument, throughout, their, principal, songwriter, jack, barnett, claimed, repeatedly, to, be, writing, a, lot, of, music, for, bassoon, in, the, run, up, to, its, recording, the, rock, band, better, than, ezra, took, their, name, from, a, passage, in, ernest, hemingway, s, a, moveable, feast, in, which, the, author, comments, that, listening, to, an, annoyingly, talkative, person, is, still, better, than, ezra, learning, how, to, play, the, bassoon, referring, to, ezra, pound, british, psychedelic, progressive, rock, band, knifeworld, features, the, bassoon, playing, of, chloe, herrington, who, also, plays, for, experimental, chamber, rock, orchestra, chrome, hoof, fiona, apple, featured, the, bassoon, in, the, opening, track, of, her, 2004, album, extraordinary, machine, in, 2016, the, bassoon, was, featured, on, the, album, gang, signs, and, prayers, by, uk, grime, artist, stormzy, played, by, uk, bassoonist, louise, watson, the, bassoon, is, heard, in, the, tracks, cold, and, mr, skeng, as, a, complement, to, the, electronic, synthesizer, bass, lines, typically, found, in, this, genre, the, cartoon, network, animated, series, over, the, garden, wall, features, a, bassoon, in, episode, 6, entitled, lullaby, in, frogland, where, the, main, character, is, encouraged, to, play, the, bassoon, to, impress, a, group, of, frogs, the, character, jan, bellows, in, the, hulu, series, only, murders, in, the, building, is, a, professional, bassoonist, the, bassoon, is, held, diagonally, in, front, of, the, player, but, unlike, the, flute, oboe, and, clarinet, it, cannot, be, easily, supported, by, the, player, s, hands, alone, some, means, of, additional, support, is, usually, required, the, most, common, ones, are, a, seat, strap, attached, to, the, base, of, the, boot, joint, which, is, laid, across, the, chair, seat, prior, to, sitting, down, or, a, neck, strap, or, shoulder, harness, attached, to, the, top, of, the, boot, joint, occasionally, a, spike, similar, to, those, used, for, the, cello, or, the, bass, clarinet, is, attached, to, the, bottom, of, the, boot, joint, and, rests, on, the, floor, it, is, possible, to, play, while, standing, up, if, the, player, uses, a, neck, strap, or, similar, harness, or, if, the, seat, strap, is, tied, to, the, belt, sometimes, a, device, called, a, balance, hanger, is, used, when, playing, in, a, standing, position, this, is, installed, between, the, instrument, and, the, neck, strap, and, shifts, the, point, of, support, closer, to, the, center, of, gravity, adjusting, the, distribution, of, weight, between, the, two, hands, the, bassoon, is, played, with, both, hands, in, a, stationary, position, the, left, above, the, right, with, five, main, finger, holes, on, the, front, of, the, instrument, nearest, the, audience, plus, a, sixth, that, is, activated, by, an, open, standing, key, five, additional, keys, on, the, front, are, controlled, by, the, little, fingers, of, each, hand, the, back, of, the, instrument, nearest, the, player, has, twelve, or, more, keys, to, be, controlled, by, the, thumbs, the, exact, number, varying, depending, on, model, to, stabilize, the, right, hand, many, bassoonists, use, an, adjustable, comma, shaped, apparatus, called, a, crutch, or, a, hand, rest, which, mounts, to, the, boot, joint, the, crutch, is, secured, with, a, thumb, screw, which, also, allows, the, distance, that, it, protrudes, from, the, bassoon, to, be, adjusted, players, rest, the, curve, of, the, right, hand, where, the, thumb, joins, the, palm, against, the, crutch, the, crutch, also, keeps, the, right, hand, from, tiring, and, enables, the, player, to, keep, the, finger, pads, flat, on, the, finger, holes, and, keys, an, aspect, of, bassoon, technique, not, found, on, any, other, woodwind, is, called, flicking, it, involves, the, left, hand, thumb, momentarily, pressing, or, flicking, the, high, a, c, and, d, keys, at, the, beginning, of, certain, notes, in, the, middle, octave, to, achieve, a, clean, slur, from, a, lower, note, this, eliminates, cracking, or, brief, multiphonics, that, happens, without, the, use, of, this, technique, alternatively, a, similar, method, is, called, venting, which, requires, that, the, register, key, be, used, as, part, of, the, full, fingering, as, opposed, to, being, open, momentarily, at, the, start, of, the, note, this, is, sometimes, called, the, european, style, venting, raises, the, intonation, of, the, notes, slightly, and, it, can, be, advantageous, when, tuning, to, higher, frequencies, some, bassoonists, flick, a, and, b, when, tongued, for, clarity, of, articulation, but, flicking, or, venting, is, practically, ubiquitous, for, slurs, while, flicking, is, used, to, slur, up, to, higher, notes, the, whisper, key, is, used, for, lower, notes, from, the, a, right, below, middle, c, and, lower, the, whisper, key, is, pressed, with, the, left, thumb, and, held, for, the, duration, of, the, note, this, prevents, cracking, as, low, notes, can, sometimes, crack, into, a, higher, octave, both, flicking, and, using, the, whisper, key, is, especially, important, to, ensure, notes, speak, properly, during, slurring, between, high, and, low, registers, while, bassoons, are, usually, critically, tuned, at, the, factory, the, player, nonetheless, has, a, great, degree, of, flexibility, of, pitch, control, through, the, use, of, breath, support, embouchure, and, reed, profile, players, can, also, use, alternate, fingerings, to, adjust, the, pitch, of, many, notes, similar, to, other, woodwind, instruments, the, length, of, the, bassoon, can, be, increased, to, lower, pitch, or, decreased, to, raise, pitch, on, the, bassoon, this, is, done, preferably, by, changing, the, bocal, to, one, of, a, different, length, lengths, are, denoted, by, a, number, on, the, bocal, usually, starting, at, 0, for, the, shortest, length, and, 3, for, the, longest, but, there, are, some, manufacturers, who, will, use, other, numbers, but, it, is, possible, to, push, the, bocal, in, or, out, slightly, to, grossly, adjust, the, pitch, the, bassoon, embouchure, is, a, very, important, aspect, of, producing, a, full, round, and, rich, sound, on, the, instrument, the, lips, are, both, rolled, over, the, teeth, often, with, the, upper, lip, further, along, in, an, overbite, the, lips, provide, micromuscular, pressure, on, the, entire, circumference, of, the, reed, which, grossly, controls, intonation, and, harmonic, excitement, and, thus, must, be, constantly, modulated, with, every, change, of, note, how, far, along, the, reed, the, lips, are, placed, affects, both, tone, with, less, reed, in, the, mouth, making, the, sound, more, edged, or, reedy, and, more, reed, making, it, smooth, and, less, projectile, and, the, way, the, reed, will, respond, to, pressure, the, musculature, employed, in, a, bassoon, embouchure, is, primarily, around, the, lips, which, pressure, the, reed, into, the, shapes, needed, for, the, desired, sound, the, jaw, is, raised, or, lowered, to, adjust, the, oral, cavity, for, better, reed, control, but, the, jaw, muscles, are, used, much, less, for, upward, vertical, pressure, than, in, single, reeds, only, being, substantially, employed, in, the, very, high, register, however, double, reed, students, often, bite, the, reed, with, these, muscles, because, the, control, and, tone, of, the, labial, and, other, muscles, is, still, developing, but, this, generally, makes, the, sound, sharp, and, choked, as, it, contracts, the, aperture, of, the, reed, and, stifles, the, vibration, of, its, blades, apart, from, the, embouchure, proper, students, must, also, develop, substantial, muscle, tone, and, control, in, the, diaphragm, throat, neck, and, upper, chest, which, are, all, employed, to, increase, and, direct, air, pressure, air, pressure, is, a, very, important, aspect, of, the, tone, intonation, and, projection, of, double, reed, instruments, affecting, these, qualities, as, much, or, more, than, the, embouchure, does, attacking, a, note, on, the, bassoon, with, imprecise, amounts, of, muscle, or, air, pressure, for, the, desired, pitch, will, result, in, poor, intonation, cracking, or, multiphonics, accidentally, producing, the, incorrect, partial, or, the, reed, not, speaking, at, all, these, problems, are, compounded, by, the, individual, qualities, of, reeds, which, are, categorically, inconsistent, in, behaviour, for, inherent, and, exherent, reasons, the, muscle, requirements, and, variability, of, reeds, mean, it, takes, some, time, for, bassoonists, and, oboists, to, develop, an, embouchure, that, exhibits, consistent, control, across, all, reeds, dynamics, and, playing, environments, the, fingering, technique, of, the, bassoon, varies, more, between, players, by, a, wide, margin, than, that, of, any, other, orchestral, woodwind, the, complex, mechanism, and, acoustics, mean, the, bassoon, lacks, simple, fingerings, of, good, sound, quality, or, intonation, for, some, notes, especially, in, the, higher, range, but, conversely, there, is, a, great, variety, of, superior, but, generally, more, complicated, fingerings, for, them, typically, the, simpler, fingerings, for, such, notes, are, used, as, alternate, or, trill, fingerings, and, the, bassoonist, will, use, as, full, fingering, one, or, several, of, the, more, complex, executions, possible, for, optimal, sound, quality, the, fingerings, used, are, at, the, discretion, of, the, bassoonist, and, for, particular, passages, he, or, she, may, experiment, to, find, new, alternate, fingerings, that, are, thus, idiomatic, to, the, player, these, elements, have, resulted, in, both, full, and, alternate, fingerings, differing, extensively, between, bassoonists, and, are, further, informed, by, factors, such, as, cultural, difference, in, what, sound, is, sought, how, reeds, are, made, and, regional, variation, in, tuning, frequencies, necessitating, sharper, or, flatter, fingerings, regional, enclaves, of, bassoonists, tend, to, have, some, uniformity, in, technique, but, on, a, global, scale, technique, differs, such, that, two, given, bassoonists, may, share, no, fingerings, for, certain, notes, owing, to, these, factors, ubiquitous, bassoon, technique, can, only, be, partially, notated, the, left, thumb, operates, nine, keys, b, 1, b, 1, c, 2, d, 2, d, 5, c, 5, also, b, 4, two, keys, when, combined, create, a, 4, and, the, whisper, key, the, whisper, key, should, be, held, down, for, notes, between, and, including, f, 2, and, g, 3, and, certain, other, notes, it, can, be, omitted, but, the, pitch, will, destabilise, additional, notes, can, be, created, with, the, left, thumb, keys, the, d, 2, and, bottom, key, above, the, whisper, key, on, the, tenor, joint, c, key, together, create, both, c, 3, and, c, 4, the, same, bottom, tenor, joint, key, is, also, used, with, additional, fingering, to, create, e, 5, and, f, 5, d, 5, and, c, 5, together, create, c, 5, when, the, two, keys, on, the, tenor, joint, to, create, a, 4, are, used, with, slightly, altered, fingering, on, the, boot, joint, b, 4, is, created, the, whisper, key, may, also, be, used, at, certain, points, throughout, the, instrument, s, high, register, along, with, other, fingerings, to, alter, sound, quality, as, desired, the, right, thumb, operates, four, keys, the, uppermost, key, is, used, to, produce, b, 2, and, b, 3, and, may, be, used, in, b, 4, f, 4, c, 5, d, 5, f, 5, and, e, 5, the, large, circular, key, otherwise, known, as, the, pancake, key, is, held, down, for, all, the, lowest, notes, from, e, 2, down, to, b, 1, it, is, also, used, like, the, whisper, key, in, additional, fingerings, for, muting, the, sound, for, example, in, ravel, s, bol, ro, the, bassoon, is, asked, to, play, the, ostinato, on, g, 4, this, is, easy, to, perform, with, the, normal, fingering, for, g, 4, but, ravel, directs, that, the, player, should, also, depress, the, e, 2, key, pancake, key, to, mute, the, sound, this, being, written, with, buffet, system, in, mind, the, g, fingering, on, which, involves, the, bb, key, sometimes, called, french, g, on, heckel, the, next, key, operated, by, the, right, thumb, is, known, as, the, spatula, key, its, primary, use, is, to, produce, f, 2, and, f, 3, the, lowermost, key, is, used, less, often, it, is, used, to, produce, a, 2, g, 2, and, a, 3, g, 3, in, a, manner, that, avoids, sliding, the, right, fourth, finger, from, another, note, the, four, fingers, of, the, left, hand, can, each, be, used, in, two, different, positions, the, key, normally, operated, by, the, index, finger, is, primarily, used, for, e, 5, also, serving, for, trills, in, the, lower, register, its, main, assignment, is, the, upper, tone, hole, this, hole, can, be, closed, fully, or, partially, by, rolling, down, the, finger, this, half, holing, technique, is, used, to, overblow, f, 3, g, 3, and, g, 3, the, middle, finger, typically, stays, on, the, centre, hole, on, the, tenor, joint, it, can, also, move, to, a, lever, used, for, e, 5, also, a, trill, key, the, ring, finger, operates, on, most, models, one, key, some, bassoons, have, an, alternate, e, key, above, the, tone, hole, predominantly, for, trills, but, many, do, not, the, smallest, finger, operates, two, side, keys, on, the, bass, joint, the, lower, key, is, typically, used, for, c, 2, but, can, be, used, for, muting, or, flattening, notes, in, the, tenor, register, the, upper, key, is, used, for, e, 2, e, 4, f, 4, f, 4, a, 4, b, 4, b, 4, c, 5, c, 5, and, d, 5, it, flattens, g, 3, and, is, the, standard, fingering, for, it, in, many, places, that, tune, to, lower, hertz, levels, such, as, a440, the, four, fingers, of, the, right, hand, have, at, least, one, assignment, each, the, index, finger, stays, over, one, hole, except, that, when, e, 5, is, played, a, side, key, at, the, top, of, the, boot, is, used, this, key, also, provides, a, c, 3, trill, albeit, sharp, on, d, the, middle, finger, remains, stationary, over, the, hole, with, a, ring, around, it, and, this, ring, and, other, pads, are, lifted, when, the, smallest, finger, on, the, right, hand, pushes, a, lever, the, ring, finger, typically, remains, stationary, on, the, lower, ring, finger, key, however, the, upper, ring, finger, key, can, be, used, typically, for, b, 2, and, b, 3, in, place, of, the, top, thumb, key, on, the, front, of, the, boot, joint, this, key, comes, from, the, oboe, and, some, bassoons, do, not, have, it, because, the, thumb, fingering, is, practically, universal, the, smallest, finger, operates, three, keys, the, backmost, one, closest, to, the, bassoonist, is, held, down, throughout, most, of, the, bass, register, f, 4, may, be, created, with, this, key, as, well, as, g, 4, b, 4, b, 4, and, c, 5, the, latter, three, employing, solely, it, to, flatten, and, stabilise, the, pitch, the, lowest, key, for, the, smallest, finger, on, the, right, hand, is, primarily, used, for, a, 2, g, 2, and, a, 3, g, 3, but, can, be, used, to, improve, d, 5, e, 5, and, f, 5, the, frontmost, key, is, used, in, addition, to, the, thumb, key, to, create, g, 2, and, g, 3, on, many, bassoons, this, key, operates, a, different, tone, hole, to, the, thumb, key, and, produces, a, slightly, flatter, f, duplicated, f, some, techniques, use, one, as, standard, for, both, octaves, and, the, other, for, utility, but, others, use, the, thumb, key, for, the, lower, and, the, fourth, finger, for, the, higher, many, extended, techniques, can, be, performed, on, the, bassoon, such, as, multiphonics, flutter, tonguing, circular, breathing, double, tonguing, and, harmonics, in, the, case, of, the, bassoon, flutter, tonguing, may, be, accomplished, by, gargling, in, the, back, of, the, throat, as, well, as, by, the, conventional, method, of, rolling, rs, multiphonics, on, the, bassoon, are, plentiful, and, can, be, achieved, by, using, particular, alternative, fingerings, but, are, generally, heavily, influenced, by, embouchure, position, also, again, using, certain, fingerings, notes, may, be, produced, on, the, instrument, that, sound, lower, pitches, than, the, actual, range, of, the, instrument, these, notes, tend, to, sound, very, gravelly, and, out, of, tune, but, technically, sound, below, the, low, b, the, bassoonist, may, also, produce, lower, notes, than, the, bottom, b, by, extending, the, length, of, bell, this, can, be, achieved, by, inserting, a, specially, made, low, a, extension, into, the, bell, but, may, also, be, achieved, with, a, small, paper, or, rubber, tube, or, a, clarinet, cor, anglais, bell, sitting, inside, the, bassoon, bell, although, the, note, may, tend, sharp, the, effect, of, this, is, to, convert, the, lower, b, into, a, lower, note, almost, always, a, natural, this, broadly, lowers, the, pitch, of, the, instrument, most, noticeably, in, the, lower, register, and, will, often, accordingly, convert, the, lowest, b, to, b, and, render, the, neighbouring, c, very, flat, the, idea, of, using, low, a, was, begun, by, richard, wagner, who, wanted, to, extend, the, range, of, the, bassoon, many, passages, in, his, later, operas, require, the, low, a, as, well, as, the, b, flat, immediately, above, it, this, is, possible, on, a, normal, bassoon, using, an, extension, which, also, flattens, low, b, to, b, but, all, extensions, to, the, bell, have, significant, effects, on, intonation, and, sound, quality, in, the, bottom, register, of, the, instrument, and, passages, such, as, this, are, more, often, realised, with, comparative, ease, by, the, contrabassoon, some, bassoons, have, been, specially, made, to, allow, bassoonists, to, realize, similar, passages, these, bassoons, are, made, with, a, wagner, bell, which, is, an, extended, bell, with, a, key, for, both, the, low, a, and, the, low, b, flat, but, they, are, not, widespread, bassoons, with, wagner, bells, suffer, similar, intonational, problems, as, a, bassoon, with, an, ordinary, a, extension, and, a, bassoon, must, be, constructed, specifically, to, accommodate, one, making, the, extension, option, far, less, complicated, extending, the, bassoon, s, range, even, lower, than, the, a, though, possible, would, have, even, stronger, effects, on, pitch, and, make, the, instrument, effectively, unusable, despite, the, logistic, difficulties, of, the, note, wagner, was, not, the, only, composer, to, write, the, low, a, another, composer, who, has, required, the, bassoon, to, be, chromatic, down, to, low, a, is, gustav, mahler, richard, strauss, also, calls, for, the, low, a, in, his, opera, intermezzo, some, works, have, optional, low, as, as, in, carl, nielsen, s, wind, quintet, op, 43, which, includes, an, optional, low, a, for, the, final, cadence, of, the, work, the, complex, fingering, system, and, the, expense, and, lack, of, access, to, quality, bassoon, reeds, can, make, the, bassoon, more, of, a, challenge, to, learn, than, some, of, the, other, woodwind, instruments, cost, is, another, factor, in, a, person, s, decision, to, pursue, the, bassoon, prices, may, range, from, us, 7, 000, to, over, 45, 000, for, a, high, quality, instrument, in, north, america, schoolchildren, may, take, up, bassoon, only, after, starting, on, another, reed, instrument, such, as, clarinet, or, saxophone, students, in, america, often, begin, to, pursue, the, study, of, bassoon, performance, and, technique, in, the, middle, years, of, their, music, education, often, in, association, with, their, school, band, program, students, are, often, provided, with, a, school, instrument, and, encouraged, to, pursue, lessons, with, private, instructors, students, typically, receive, instruction, in, proper, posture, hand, position, embouchure, repertoire, and, tone, production
