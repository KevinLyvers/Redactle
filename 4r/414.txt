the, form, of, a, singspiel, a, popular, form, during, the, time, it, was, written, that, included, both, singing, and, spoken, dialogue, the, work, premiered, on, 30, september, 1791, at, schikaneder, s, theatre, the, freihaus, theater, auf, der, wieden, in, vienna, just, two, months, before, the, composer, s, death, it, was, the, last, opera, that, mozart, composed, still, a, staple, of, the, opera, repertory, its, popularity, was, reflected, by, two, immediate, sequels, peter, winter, s, das, labyrinth, oder, der, kampf, mit, den, elementen, der, zauberfl, te, zweyter, theil, 1798, and, a, fragmentary, libretto, by, johann, wolfgang, von, goethe, titled, the, magic, flute, part, two, the, allegorical, plot, was, influenced, by, schikaneder, and, mozart, s, interest, in, freemasonry, and, concerns, the, initiation, of, prince, tamino, enlisted, by, the, queen, of, the, night, to, rescue, her, daughter, pamina, from, the, high, priest, sarastro, tamino, comes, to, admire, the, high, ideals, of, sarastro, he, and, pamina, both, join, sarastro, s, community, while, the, queen, and, her, allies, are, vanquished, the, opera, was, the, culmination, of, a, period, of, increasing, involvement, by, mozart, with, schikaneder, s, theatrical, troupe, which, since, 1789, had, been, the, resident, company, at, the, theater, auf, der, wieden, mozart, was, a, close, friend, of, one, of, the, singer, composers, of, the, troupe, tenor, benedikt, schack, the, first, tamino, and, had, contributed, to, the, compositions, of, the, troupe, which, were, often, collaboratively, written, mozart, s, participation, increased, with, his, contributions, to, the, 1790, collaborative, opera, der, stein, der, weisen, the, philosopher, s, stone, including, the, duet, nun, liebes, weibchen, k, 625, 592a, among, other, passages, like, the, magic, flute, der, stein, der, weisen, was, a, fairy, tale, opera, and, can, be, considered, a, kind, of, precursor, it, employed, much, the, same, cast, in, similar, roles, the, libretto, for, the, magic, flute, written, by, schikaneder, is, thought, by, scholars, to, be, based, on, many, sources, some, works, of, literature, current, in, vienna, in, schikaneder, s, day, that, may, have, served, as, sources, include, the, medieval, romance, yvain, by, chr, tien, de, troyes, the, novel, life, of, sethos, by, jean, terrasson, and, the, essay, on, the, mysteries, of, the, egyptians, by, ignaz, von, born, the, libretto, is, also, a, natural, continuation, of, a, series, of, fairy, tale, operas, produced, at, the, time, by, schikaneder, s, troupe, including, an, adaptation, of, sophie, seyler, s, singspiel, oberon, as, well, as, der, stein, der, weisen, especially, for, the, role, of, papageno, the, libretto, draws, on, the, hanswurst, tradition, of, the, viennese, popular, theatre, many, scholars, also, acknowledge, an, influence, of, freemasonry, the, magic, flute, appears, to, have, two, references, to, the, music, of, antonio, salieri, the, first, is, that, the, papageno, papagena, duet, is, similar, to, the, cucuzze, cavatina, in, salieri, s, prima, la, musica, e, poi, le, parole, both, are, centred, around, musical, textual, playfulness, with, humorous, bird, like, utterances, of, pseudo, italian, words, the, magic, flute, also, echoes, salieri, s, music, in, that, papageno, s, whistle, is, based, on, a, motif, borrowed, from, salieri, s, concerto, for, clavicembalo, in, b, flat, major, the, opera, was, premiered, in, vienna, on, 30, september, 1791, at, the, suburban, freihaus, theater, auf, der, wieden, mozart, conducted, the, orchestra, and, schikaneder, himself, played, papageno, while, the, role, of, the, queen, of, the, night, was, sung, by, mozart, s, sister, in, law, josepha, hofer, on, the, reception, of, the, opera, mozart, scholar, maynard, solomon, writes, although, there, were, no, reviews, of, the, first, performances, it, was, immediately, evident, that, mozart, and, schikaneder, had, achieved, a, great, success, the, opera, drawing, immense, crowds, and, reaching, hundreds, of, performances, during, the, 1790s, as, mozart, s, letters, show, he, was, very, pleased, to, have, achieved, such, a, success, solomon, continues, mozart, s, delight, is, reflected, in, his, last, three, letters, written, to, constanze, who, with, her, sister, sophie, was, spending, the, second, week, of, october, in, baden, i, have, this, moment, returned, from, the, opera, which, was, as, full, as, ever, he, wrote, on, 7, october, listing, the, numbers, that, had, to, be, encored, but, what, always, gives, me, the, most, pleasure, is, the, silent, approval, you, can, see, how, this, opera, is, becoming, more, and, more, esteemed, he, went, to, hear, his, opera, almost, every, night, taking, along, relatives, the, opera, celebrated, its, 100th, performance, in, november, 1792, though, mozart, did, not, have, the, pleasure, of, witnessing, this, milestone, as, he, had, died, on, 5, december, 1791, the, opera, was, first, performed, outside, vienna, 21, september, 1792, in, lemberg, then, in, prague, it, then, made, triumphal, progress, through, germany, s, opera, houses, great, and, small, and, with, the, early, 19th, century, spread, to, essentially, all, the, countries, of, europe, and, eventually, everywhere, in, the, world, where, opera, is, cultivated, as, branscombe, documents, the, earlier, performances, were, often, of, highly, altered, sometimes, even, mutilated, versions, of, the, opera, see, ludwig, wenzel, lachnith, productions, of, the, past, century, have, tended, to, be, more, faithful, to, mozart, s, music, though, faithful, rendering, of, mozart, and, schikaneder, s, original, quite, explicit, stage, directions, and, dramatic, vision, continues, to, be, rare, with, isolated, exceptions, modern, productions, strongly, reflect, the, creative, preferences, of, the, stage, director, the, magic, flute, is, among, the, most, frequently, performed, of, all, operas, on, 28, december, 1791, three, and, a, half, weeks, after, mozart, s, death, his, widow, constanze, offered, to, send, a, manuscript, score, of, the, magic, flute, to, the, electoral, court, in, bonn, nikolaus, simrock, published, this, text, in, the, first, full, score, edition, bonn, 1814, claiming, that, it, was, in, accordance, with, mozart, s, own, wishes, allgemeine, musikalische, zeitung, 13, september, 1815, the, magic, flute, is, noted, for, its, prominent, masonic, elements, although, some, scholars, hold, that, the, masonic, influence, is, exaggerated, schikaneder, and, mozart, were, freemasons, as, was, ignaz, alberti, engraver, and, printer, of, the, first, libretto, the, opera, is, also, influenced, by, enlightenment, philosophy, and, can, be, regarded, as, advocating, enlightened, absolutism, the, queen, of, the, night, is, seen, by, some, to, represent, a, dangerous, form, of, obscurantism, by, others, to, represent, roman, catholic, empress, maria, theresa, who, banned, freemasonry, from, austria, still, others, see, the, roman, catholic, church, itself, which, was, and, still, is, strongly, anti, masonic, likewise, the, literature, repeatedly, addresses, the, fact, that, the, central, theme, of, the, work, is, not, only, love, but, also, becoming, a, better, person, by, overcoming, trials, similar, to, wagner, s, parsifal, later, on, the, names, of, the, performers, at, the, premiere, are, taken, from, a, preserved, playbill, for, this, performance, at, right, which, does, not, give, full, names, hr, herr, mr, mme, madame, mrs, mlle, mademoiselle, miss, while, the, female, roles, in, the, opera, are, assigned, to, different, voice, types, the, playbill, for, the, premiere, performance, referred, to, all, of, the, female, singers, as, sopranos, the, casting, of, the, roles, relies, on, the, actual, vocal, range, of, the, part, the, work, is, scored, for, two, flutes, one, doubling, on, piccolo, two, oboes, two, clarinets, doubling, basset, horns, two, bassoons, two, horns, two, trumpets, three, trombones, alto, tenor, and, bass, timpani, and, strings, it, also, requires, a, four, part, chorus, for, several, numbers, notably, the, finales, of, each, act, mozart, also, called, for, a, stromento, d, acciaio, instrument, of, steel, to, perform, papageno, s, magic, bells, this, instrument, has, since, been, lost, to, history, though, modern, day, scholars, believe, it, to, be, a, keyed, glockenspiel, which, is, usually, replaced, with, a, celesta, in, modern, day, performances, charles, rosen, has, remarked, on, the, character, of, mozart, s, orchestration, die, zauberfl, te, has, the, greatest, variety, of, orchestral, color, that, the,
