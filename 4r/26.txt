romanesque, architecture, is, an, architectural, style, of, medieval, europe, that, was, predominant, in, the, 11th, and, 12th, centuries, the, style, eventually, developed, into, the, gothic, style, with, the, shape, of, the, arches, providing, a, simple, distinction, the, romanesque, is, characterized, by, semicircular, arches, while, the, gothic, is, marked, by, the, pointed, arches, the, romanesque, emerged, nearly, simultaneously, in, multiple, countries, france, germany, italy, spain, its, examples, can, be, found, across, the, continent, making, it, the, first, pan, european, architectural, style, since, imperial, roman, architecture, similarly, to, gothic, the, name, of, the, style, was, transferred, onto, the, contemporary, romanesque, art, combining, features, of, ancient, roman, and, byzantine, buildings, and, other, local, traditions, romanesque, architecture, is, known, by, its, massive, quality, thick, walls, round, arches, sturdy, pillars, barrel, vaults, large, towers, and, decorative, arcading, each, building, has, clearly, defined, forms, frequently, of, very, regular, symmetrical, plan, the, overall, appearance, is, one, of, simplicity, when, compared, with, the, gothic, buildings, that, were, to, follow, the, style, can, be, identified, right, across, europe, despite, regional, characteristics, and, different, materials, many, castles, were, built, during, this, period, but, they, are, greatly, outnumbered, by, churches, the, most, significant, are, the, great, abbey, churches, many, of, which, are, still, standing, more, or, less, complete, and, frequently, in, use, the, enormous, quantity, of, churches, built, in, the, romanesque, period, was, succeeded, by, the, still, busier, period, of, gothic, architecture, which, partly, or, entirely, rebuilt, most, romanesque, churches, in, prosperous, areas, like, england, and, portugal, the, largest, groups, of, romanesque, survivors, are, in, areas, that, were, less, prosperous, in, subsequent, periods, including, parts, of, southern, france, rural, spain, and, rural, italy, survivals, of, unfortified, romanesque, secular, houses, and, palaces, and, the, domestic, quarters, of, monasteries, are, far, rarer, but, these, used, and, adapted, the, features, found, in, church, buildings, on, a, domestic, scale, the, french, term, romane, or, the, english, romanesque, meaning, in, the, manner, of, romans, has, been, used, to, describe, the, architectural, style, of, the, mediaeval, era, preceding, the, more, easily, recognizable, gothic, architecture, since, early, in, the, 19th, century, it, describes, the, architectural, style, which, flourished, across, europe, from, the, 11th, to, the, 13th, century, and, is, distinguished, from, the, gothic, style, that, followed, by, semi, circular, arches, and, more, massive, forms, the, development, of, vaults, from, barrel, and, groin, vaults, to, ribbed, vaults, was, the, main, structural, innovation, of, this, period, the, distinction, between, the, style, of, architecture, now, known, as, romanesque, and, the, succeeding, style, of, gothic, architecture, was, recognised, as, early, as, the, 15th, century, as, demonstrated, by, some, artworks, of, that, period, robert, campin, clearly, presented, the, division, in, his, marriage, of, the, virgin, on, the, left, side, representing, the, old, testament, the, building, is, in, the, romanesque, style, while, that, on, the, right, representing, the, new, testament, is, gothic, until, the, 19th, century, however, the, style, preceding, gothic, was, not, recognized, as, a, whole, and, was, instead, just, like, gothic, at, the, time, treated, as, a, multitude, of, styles, giorgio, vasari, and, christopher, wren, were, writing, about, tuscan, saxon, or, norman, architectures, the, word, romanesque, in, the, manner, of, romans, appeared, in, english, by, 1666, and, was, used, to, designate, what, are, now, called, romance, languages, definition, of, romanesque, architecture, changed, over, time, the, development, of, the, modern, english, meaning, of, the, word, involved, primarily, two, steps, the, french, term, romane, was, first, used, in, the, architectural, sense, by, archaeologist, charles, de, gerville, in, a, letter, of, 18, december, 1818, to, auguste, le, pr, vost, to, describe, what, gerville, sees, as, a, debased, roman, architecture, in, an, 1823, public, lecture, published, in, 1824, gerville, s, friend, arcisse, de, caumont, adopted, the, label, roman, to, describe, the, degraded, european, architecture, from, the, 5th, to, the, 13th, centuries, in, his, essai, sur, l, architecture, religieuse, du, moyen, ge, particuli, rement, en, normandie, at, a, time, when, the, actual, dates, of, many, of, the, buildings, so, described, had, not, been, ascertained, the, name, roman, esque, we, give, to, this, architecture, which, should, be, universal, as, it, is, the, same, everywhere, with, slight, local, differences, also, has, the, merit, of, indicating, its, origin, and, is, not, new, since, it, is, used, already, to, describe, the, language, of, the, same, period, romance, language, is, degenerated, latin, language, romanesque, architecture, is, debased, roman, architecture, the, term, pre, romanesque, is, sometimes, applied, to, architecture, in, germany, of, the, carolingian, and, ottonian, periods, and, visigothic, mozarab, and, asturian, constructions, between, the, 8th, and, the, 10th, centuries, in, the, iberian, peninsula, while, first, romanesque, is, applied, to, buildings, in, north, of, italy, and, spain, and, parts, of, france, that, have, romanesque, features, but, pre, date, the, influence, of, the, abbey, of, cluny, the, romanesque, style, in, england, and, sicily, is, still, referred, to, as, norman, architecture, a, dazzling, style, developed, in, pisa, in, the, mid, 11th, century, is, called, pisan, romanesque, eric, fernie, writes, that, by, the, beginning, of, the, 21st, century, there, is, something, like, agreement, on, the, characteristics, of, the, romanesque, style, some, researchers, argue, that, due, to, an, astonishing, diversity, of, the, romanesque, buildings, a, unanimous, definition, is, impossible, o, single, model, no, single, rule, ever, seems, adequate, to, prevail, and, the, romanesque, should, be, treated, as, a, collection, of, trends, despite, disagreement, the, term, became, a, common, currency, and, is, universally, accepted, at, least, for, convenience, buildings, of, every, type, were, constructed, in, the, romanesque, style, with, evidence, remaining, of, simple, domestic, buildings, elegant, town, houses, grand, palaces, commercial, premises, civic, buildings, castles, city, walls, bridges, village, churches, abbey, churches, abbey, complexes, and, large, cathedrals, of, these, types, of, buildings, domestic, and, commercial, buildings, are, the, most, rare, with, only, a, handful, of, survivors, in, the, united, kingdom, several, clusters, in, france, isolated, buildings, across, europe, and, by, far, the, largest, number, often, unidentified, and, altered, over, the, centuries, in, italy, many, castles, exist, the, foundations, of, which, date, from, the, romanesque, period, most, have, been, substantially, altered, and, many, are, in, ruins, by, far, the, greatest, number, of, surviving, romanesque, buildings, are, churches, these, range, from, tiny, chapels, to, large, cathedrals, although, many, have, been, extended, and, altered, in, different, styles, a, large, number, remain, either, substantially, intact, or, sympathetically, restored, demonstrating, the, form, character, and, decoration, of, romanesque, church, architecture, romanesque, architecture, was, the, first, distinctive, style, to, spread, across, europe, since, the, roman, empire, with, the, decline, of, rome, roman, building, methods, survived, to, an, extent, in, western, europe, where, successive, merovingian, carolingian, and, ottonian, architects, continued, to, build, large, stone, buildings, such, as, monastery, churches, and, palaces, in, the, more, northern, countries, roman, building, styles, and, techniques, had, never, been, adopted, except, for, official, buildings, while, in, scandinavia, they, were, unknown, although, the, round, arch, continued, in, use, the, engineering, skills, required, to, vault, large, spaces, and, build, large, domes, were, lost, there, was, a, loss, of, stylistic, continuity, particularly, apparent, in, the, decline, of, the, formal, vocabulary, of, the, classical, orders, in, rome, several, great, constantinian, basilicas, continued, in, use, as, an, inspiration, to, later, builders, some, traditions, of, roman, architecture, also, survived, in, byzantine, architecture, with, the, 6th, century, octagonal, byzantine, basilica, of, san, vitale, in, ravenna, being, the, inspiration, for, the, greatest, building, of, the, early, middle, ages, in, europe, the, emperor, charlemagne, s, palatine, chapel, aachen, germany, built, around, the, year, ad, 800, dating, shortly, after, the, palatine, chapel, is, a, remarkable, 9th, century, swiss, manuscript, known, as, the, plan, of, saint, gall, and, showing, a, very, detailed, plan, of, a, monastic, complex, with, all, its, various, monastic, buildings, and, their, functions, labelled, the, largest, building, is, the, church, the, plan, of, which, is, distinctly, germanic, having, an, apse, at, both, ends, an, arrangement, not, generally, seen, elsewhere, another, feature, of, the, church, is, its, regular, proportion, the, square, plan, of, the, crossing, tower, providing, a, module, for, the, rest, of, the, plan, these, features, can, both, be, seen, at, the, proto, romanesque, st, michael, s, church, hildesheim, 1001, 1030, architecture, of, a, romanesque, style, also, developed, simultaneously, in, the, north, of, italy, parts, of, france, and, in, the, iberian, peninsula, in, the, 10th, century, and, prior, to, the, later, influence, of, the, abbey, of, cluny, the, style, sometimes, called, first, romanesque, or, lombard, romanesque, is, characterised, by, thick, walls, lack, of, sculpture, and, the, presence, of, rhythmic, ornamental, arches, known, as, a, lombard, band, charlemagne, was, crowned, by, pope, leo, iii, in, old, st, peter, s, basilica, on, christmas, day, of, 800, with, an, aim, to, re, establishing, the, old, roman, empire, charlemagne, s, political, successors, continued, to, rule, much, of, europe, with, a, gradual, emergence, of, the, separate, political, states, that, were, eventually, to, become, welded, into, nations, either, by, allegiance, or, defeat, into, the, kingdom, of, germany, giving, rise, to, the, holy, roman, empire, the, invasion, of, england, by, william, duke, of, normandy, in, 1066, saw, the, building, of, both, castles, and, churches, that, reinforced, the, norman, presence, several, significant, churches, that, were, built, at, this, time, were, founded, by, rulers, as, seats, of, temporal, and, religious, power, or, places, of, coronation, and, burial, these, include, the, abbaye, saint, denis, speyer, cathedral, and, westminster, abbey, where, little, of, the, pre, conquest, church, now, remains, at, a, time, when, the, remaining, architectural, structures, of, the, roman, empire, were, falling, into, decay, and, much, of, its, learning, and, technology, lost, the, building, of, masonry, domes, and, the, carving, of, decorative, architectural, details, continued, unabated, though, greatly, evolved, in, style, since, the, fall, of, rome, in, the, enduring, byzantine, empire, the, domed, churches, of, constantinople, and, eastern, europe, were, to, greatly, affect, the, architecture, of, certain, towns, particularly, through, trade, and, through, the, crusades, the, most, notable, single, building, that, demonstrates, this, is, st, mark, s, basilica, venice, but, there, are, many, lesser, known, examples, particularly, in, france, such, as, the, church, of, saint, front, p, rigueux, and, angoul, me, cathedral, much, of, europe, was, affected, by, feudalism, in, which, peasants, held, tenure, from, local, rulers, over, the, land, that, they, farmed, in, exchange, for, military, service, the, result, of, this, was, that, they, could, be, called, upon, not, only, for, local, and, regional, spats, but, to, follow, their, lord, to, travel, across, europe, to, the, crusades, if, they, were, required, to, do, so, the, crusades, 1095, 1270, brought, about, a, very, large, movement, of, people, and, with, them, ideas, and, trade, skills, particularly, those, involved, in, the, building, of, fortifications, and, the, metal, working, needed, for, the, provision, of, arms, which, was, also, applied, to, the, fitting, and, decoration, of, buildings, the, continual, movement, of, people, rulers, nobles, bishops, abbots, craftsmen, and, peasants, was, an, important, factor, in, creating, a, homogeneity, in, building, methods, and, a, recognizable, romanesque, style, despite, regional, differences, life, became, generally, less, secure, after, the, carolingian, period, this, resulted, in, the, building, of, castles, at, strategic, points, many, of, them, being, constructed, as, strongholds, of, the, normans, descendants, of, the, vikings, who, invaded, northern, france, under, rollo, in, 911, political, struggles, also, resulted, in, the, fortification, of, many, towns, or, the, rebuilding, and, strengthening, of, walls, that, remained, from, the, roman, period, one, of, the, most, notable, surviving, fortifications, is, that, of, the, city, of, carcassonne, the, enclosure, of, towns, brought, about, a, lack, of, living, space, within, the, walls, and, resulted, in, a, style, of, town, house, that, was, tall, and, narrow, often, surrounding, communal, courtyards, as, at, san, gimignano, in, tuscany, and, bologna, and, pavia, in, lombardy, in, germany, the, holy, roman, emperors, built, a, number, of, residences, fortified, but, essentially, palaces, rather, than, castles, at, strategic, points, and, on, trade, routes, the, imperial, palace, of, goslar, heavily, restored, in, the, 19th, century, was, built, in, the, early, 11th, century, by, otto, iii, and, henry, iii, while, the, ruined, palace, at, gelnhausen, was, received, by, frederick, barbarossa, prior, to, 1170, the, movement, of, people, and, armies, also, brought, about, the, building, of, bridges, some, of, which, have, survived, including, the, 12th, century, bridge, at, besal, catalonia, the, 11th, century, puente, de, la, reina, navarre, and, the, pont, saint, b, n, zet, avignon, across, europe, the, late, 11th, and, 12th, centuries, saw, an, unprecedented, growth, in, the, number, of, churches, a, great, number, of, these, buildings, both, large, and, small, remain, some, almost, intact, and, in, others, altered, almost, beyond, recognition, in, later, centuries, they, include, many, very, well, known, churches, such, as, santa, maria, in, cosmedin, in, rome, the, baptistery, in, florence, and, san, zeno, maggiore, in, verona, in, france, the, famous, abbeys, of, aux, dames, and, les, hommes, at, caen, and, mont, saint, michel, date, from, this, period, as, well, as, the, abbeys, of, the, pilgrimage, route, to, santiago, de, compostela, many, cathedrals, owe, their, foundation, to, this, date, with, others, beginning, as, abbey, churches, and, later, becoming, cathedrals, in, england, of, the, cathedrals, of, ancient, foundation, all, were, begun, in, this, period, with, the, exception, of, salisbury, where, the, monks, relocated, from, the, norman, church, at, old, sarum, and, several, such, as, canterbury, which, were, rebuilt, on, the, site, of, saxon, churches, in, spain, the, most, famous, church, of, the, period, is, santiago, de, compostela, in, germany, the, rhine, and, its, tributaries, were, the, location, of, many, romanesque, abbeys, notably, mainz, worms, speyer, and, bamberg, in, cologne, then, the, largest, city, north, of, the, alps, a, very, important, group, of, large, city, churches, survived, largely, intact, as, monasticism, spread, across, europe, romanesque, churches, sprang, up, in, scotland, scandinavia, poland, hungary, sicily, serbia, and, tunisia, several, important, romanesque, churches, were, built, in, the, crusader, kingdoms, the, system, of, monasticism, in, which, the, religious, become, members, of, an, order, with, common, ties, and, a, common, rule, living, in, a, mutually, dependent, community, rather, than, as, a, group, of, hermits, living, in, proximity, but, essentially, separate, was, established, by, the, monk, benedict, in, the, 6th, century, the, benedictine, monasteries, spread, from, italy, throughout, europe, being, always, by, far, the, most, numerous, in, england, they, were, followed, by, the, cluniac, order, the, cistercians, carthusians, and, augustinian, canons, during, the, crusades, the, military, orders, of, the, knights, hospitaller, and, the, knights, templar, were, founded, the, monasteries, which, sometimes, also, functioned, as, cathedrals, and, the, cathedrals, that, had, bodies, of, secular, clergy, often, living, in, community, were, a, major, source, of, power, in, europe, bishops, and, the, abbots, of, important, monasteries, lived, and, functioned, like, princes, the, monasteries, were, the, major, seats, of, learning, of, all, sorts, benedict, had, ordered, that, all, the, arts, were, to, be, taught, and, practiced, in, the, monasteries, within, the, monasteries, books, were, transcribed, by, hand, and, few, people, outside, the, monasteries, could, read, or, write, in, france, burgundy, was, the, centre, of, monasticism, the, enormous, and, powerful, monastery, at, cluny, was, to, have, lasting, effect, on, the, layout, of, other, monasteries, and, the, design, of, their, churches, very, little, of, the, abbey, church, at, cluny, remains, the, cluny, ii, rebuilding, of, 963, onwards, has, completely, vanished, but, we, have, a, good, idea, of, the, design, of, cluny, iii, from, 1088, to, 1130, which, until, the, renaissance, remained, the, largest, building, in, europe, however, the, church, of, st, sernin, at, toulouse, 1080, 1120, has, remained, intact, and, demonstrates, the, regularity, of, romanesque, design, with, its, modular, form, its, massive, appearance, and, the, repetition, of, the, simple, arched, window, motif, one, of, the, effects, of, the, crusades, which, were, intended, to, wrest, the, holy, places, of, the, levant, from, islamic, control, was, to, excite, a, great, deal, of, religious, fervour, which, in, turn, inspired, great, building, programs, the, nobility, of, europe, upon, safe, return, thanked, god, by, the, building, of, a, new, church, or, the, enhancement, of, an, old, one, likewise, those, who, did, not, return, from, the, crusades, could, be, suitably, commemorated, by, their, family, in, a, work, of, stone, and, mortar, the, crusades, resulted, in, the, transfer, of, among, other, things, a, great, number, of, holy, relics, of, saints, and, apostles, many, churches, like, saint, front, p, rigueux, had, their, own, home, grown, saint, while, others, most, notably, santiago, de, compostela, claimed, the, remains, and, the, patronage, of, a, powerful, saint, in, this, case, one, of, the, twelve, apostles, santiago, de, compostela, located, in, the, kingdom, of, galicia, present, day, galicia, spain, became, one, of, the, most, important, pilgrimage, destinations, in, europe, most, of, the, pilgrims, travelled, the, way, of, st, james, on, foot, many, of, them, barefooted, as, a, sign, of, penance, they, moved, along, one, of, the, four, main, routes, that, passed, through, france, congregating, for, the, journey, at, jumi, ges, paris, v, zelay, cluny, arles, and, st, gall, in, switzerland, they, crossed, two, passes, in, the, pyrenees, and, converged, into, a, single, stream, to, traverse, north, western, spain, along, the, route, they, were, urged, on, by, those, pilgrims, returning, from, the, journey, on, each, of, the, routes, abbeys, such, as, those, at, moissac, toulouse, roncesvalles, conques, limoges, and, burgos, catered, for, the, flow, of, people, and, grew, wealthy, from, the, passing, trade, saint, beno, t, du, sault, in, the, berry, province, is, typical, of, the, churches, that, were, founded, on, the, pilgrim, route, the, general, impression, given, by, romanesque, architecture, in, both, ecclesiastical, and, secular, buildings, is, one, of, massive, solidity, and, strength, in, contrast, with, both, the, preceding, roman, and, later, gothic, architecture, in, which, the, load, bearing, structural, members, are, or, appear, to, be, columns, pilasters, and, arches, romanesque, architecture, in, common, with, byzantine, architecture, relies, upon, its, walls, or, sections, of, walls, called, piers, romanesque, architecture, is, often, divided, into, two, periods, known, as, the, first, romanesque, style, and, the, romanesque, style, the, difference, is, chiefly, a, matter, of, the, expertise, with, which, the, buildings, were, constructed, the, first, romanesque, employed, rubble, walls, smaller, windows, and, unvaulted, roofs, a, greater, refinement, marks, the, second, romanesque, along, with, increased, use, of, the, vault, and, dressed, stone, the, walls, of, romanesque, buildings, are, often, of, massive, thickness, with, few, and, comparatively, small, openings, they, are, often, double, shells, filled, with, rubble, the, building, material, differs, greatly, across, europe, depending, upon, the, local, stone, and, building, traditions, in, italy, poland, much, of, germany, and, parts, of, the, netherlands, brick, is, generally, used, other, areas, saw, extensive, use, of, limestone, granite, and, flint, the, building, stone, was, often, used, in, comparatively, small, and, irregular, pieces, bedded, in, thick, mortar, smooth, ashlar, masonry, was, not, a, distinguishing, feature, of, the, style, especially, not, in, the, earlier, part, of, the, period, but, it, did, occur, chiefly, where, easily, worked, limestone, was, available, because, of, the, massive, nature, of, romanesque, walls, buttresses, are, not, a, highly, significant, feature, as, they, are, in, gothic, architecture, romanesque, buttresses, are, generally, of, flat, square, profile, and, do, not, project, a, great, deal, beyond, the, wall, in, the, case, of, aisled, churches, barrel, vaults, or, half, barrel, vaults, over, the, aisles, helped, to, buttress, the, nave, if, it, was, vaulted, in, the, cases, where, half, barrel, vaults, were, used, they, effectively, became, like, flying, buttresses, often, aisles, extended, through, two, storeys, rather, than, the, one, usual, in, gothic, architecture, so, as, to, better, support, the, weight, of, a, vaulted, nave, in, the, case, of, durham, cathedral, flying, buttresses, have, been, employed, but, are, hidden, inside, the, triforium, gallery, the, arches, used, in, romanesque, architecture, are, nearly, always, semicircular, for, openings, such, as, doors, and, windows, for, vaults, and, for, arcades, wide, doorways, are, usually, surmounted, by, a, semi, circular, arch, except, where, a, door, with, a, lintel, is, set, into, a, large, arched, recess, and, surmounted, by, a, semi, circular, lunette, with, decorative, carving, these, doors, sometimes, have, a, carved, central, jamb, narrow, doors, and, small, windows, might, be, surmounted, by, a, solid, stone, lintel, larger, openings, are, nearly, always, arched, a, characteristic, feature, of, romanesque, architecture, both, ecclesiastic, and, domestic, is, the, pairing, of, two, arched, windows, or, arcade, openings, separated, by, a, pillar, or, colonette, and, often, set, within, a, larger, arch, ocular, windows, are, common, in, italy, particularly, in, the, fa, ade, gable, and, are, also, seen, in, germany, later, romanesque, churches, may, have, wheel, windows, or, rose, windows, with, plate, tracery, there, are, a, very, small, number, of, buildings, in, the, romanesque, style, such, as, autun, cathedral, in, france, and, monreale, cathedral, in, sicily, in, which, pointed, arches, have, been, used, extensively, apparently, for, stylistic, reasons, it, is, believed, that, in, these, cases, there, is, a, direct, imitation, of, islamic, architecture, at, other, late, romanesque, churches, such, as, durham, cathedral, and, cefal, cathedral, the, pointed, arch, was, introduced, as, a, structural, device, in, ribbed, vaulting, its, increasing, application, was, fundamental, to, the, development, of, gothic, architecture, an, arcade, is, a, row, of, arches, supported, on, piers, or, columns, they, occur, in, the, interior, of, large, churches, separating, the, nave, from, the, aisles, and, in, large, secular, interiors, spaces, such, as, the, great, hall, of, a, castle, supporting, the, timbers, of, a, roof, or, upper, floor, arcades, also, occur, in, cloisters, and, atriums, enclosing, an, open, space, arcades, can, occur, in, storeys, or, stages, while, the, arcade, of, a, cloister, is, typically, of, a, single, stage, the, arcade, that, divides, the, nave, and, aisles, in, a, church, is, typically, of, two, stages, with, a, third, stage, of, window, openings, known, as, the, clerestory, rising, above, them, arcading, on, a, large, scale, generally, fulfils, a, structural, purpose, but, it, is, also, used, generally, on, a, smaller, scale, as, a, decorative, feature, both, internally, and, externally, where, it, is, frequently, blind, arcading, with, only, a, wall, or, a, narrow, passage, behind, it, in, romanesque, architecture, piers, were, often, employed, to, support, arches, they, were, built, of, masonry, and, square, or, rectangular, in, section, generally, having, a, horizontal, moulding, representing, a, capital, at, the, springing, of, the, arch, sometimes, piers, have, vertical, shafts, attached, to, them, and, may, also, have, horizontal, mouldings, at, the, level, of, the, base, although, basically, rectangular, piers, can, often, be, of, highly, complex, form, with, half, segments, of, large, hollow, core, columns, on, the, inner, surface, supporting, the, arch, or, a, clustered, group, of, smaller, shafts, leading, into, the, mouldings, of, the, arch, piers, that, occur, at, the, intersection, of, two, large, arches, such, as, those, under, the, crossing, of, the, nave, and, transept, are, commonly, cruciform, in, shape, each, arch, having, its, own, supporting, rectangular, pier, at, right, angles, to, the, other, columns, are, an, important, structural, feature, of, romanesque, architecture, colonnettes, and, attached, shafts, are, also, used, structurally, and, for, decoration, monolithic, columns, cut, from, a, single, piece, of, stone, were, frequently, used, in, italy, as, they, had, been, in, roman, and, early, christian, architecture, they, were, also, used, particularly, in, germany, when, they, alternated, between, more, massive, piers, arcades, of, columns, cut, from, single, pieces, are, also, common, in, structures, that, do, not, bear, massive, weights, of, masonry, such, as, cloisters, where, they, are, sometimes, paired, in, italy, during, this, period, a, great, number, of, antique, roman, columns, were, salvaged, and, reused, in, the, interiors, and, on, the, porticos, of, churches, the, most, durable, of, these, columns, are, of, marble, and, have, the, stone, horizontally, bedded, the, majority, are, vertically, bedded, and, are, sometimes, of, a, variety, of, colours, they, may, have, retained, their, original, roman, capitals, generally, of, the, corinthian, or, roman, composite, style, some, buildings, like, santa, maria, in, cosmedin, illustrated, above, and, the, atrium, at, san, clemente, in, rome, may, have, an, odd, assortment, of, columns, in, which, large, capitals, are, placed, on, short, columns, and, small, capitals, are, placed, on, taller, columns, to, even, the, height, architectural, compromises, of, this, type, are, seen, where, materials, have, been, salvaged, from, a, number, of, buildings, salvaged, columns, were, also, used, to, a, lesser, extent, in, france, in, most, parts, of, europe, romanesque, columns, were, massive, as, they, supported, thick, upper, walls, with, small, windows, and, sometimes, heavy, vaults, the, most, common, method, of, construction, was, to, build, them, out, of, stone, cylinders, called, drums, as, in, the, crypt, at, speyer, cathedral, where, really, massive, columns, were, called, for, such, as, those, at, durham, cathedral, they, were, constructed, of, ashlar, masonry, and, the, hollow, core, was, filled, with, rubble, these, huge, untapered, columns, are, sometimes, ornamented, with, incised, decorations, a, common, characteristic, of, romanesque, buildings, occurring, both, in, churches, and, in, the, arcades, that, separate, large, interior, spaces, of, castles, is, the, alternation, of, piers, and, columns, the, most, simple, form, that, this, takes, is, to, have, a, column, between, each, adjoining, pier, sometimes, the, columns, are, in, multiples, of, two, or, three, at, st, michael, s, hildesheim, an, a, b, b, a, alternation, occurs, in, the, nave, while, an, a, b, a, alternation, can, be, seen, in, the, transepts, at, jumi, ges, there, are, tall, drum, columns, between, piers, each, of, which, has, a, half, column, supporting, the, arch, there, are, many, variations, on, this, theme, most, notably, at, durham, cathedral, where, the, mouldings, and, shafts, of, the, piers, are, of, exceptional, richness, and, the, huge, masonry, columns, are, deeply, incised, with, geometric, patterns, often, the, arrangement, was, made, more, complex, by, the, complexity, of, the, piers, themselves, so, that, it, was, not, piers, and, columns, that, alternated, but, rather, piers, of, entirely, different, form, from, each, other, such, as, those, of, sant, ambrogio, milan, where, the, nature, of, the, vault, dictated, that, the, alternate, piers, bore, a, great, deal, more, weight, than, the, intermediate, ones, and, are, thus, very, much, larger, the, foliate, corinthian, style, provided, the, inspiration, for, many, romanesque, capitals, and, the, accuracy, with, which, they, were, carved, depended, very, much, on, the, availability, of, original, models, those, in, italian, churches, such, as, pisa, cathedral, or, church, of, sant, alessandro, in, lucca, and, southern, france, being, much, closer, to, the, classical, than, those, in, england, the, corinthian, capital, is, essentially, round, at, the, bottom, where, it, sits, on, a, circular, column, and, square, at, the, top, where, it, supports, the, wall, or, arch, this, form, of, capital, was, maintained, in, the, general, proportions, and, outline, of, the, romanesque, capital, this, was, achieved, most, simply, by, cutting, a, rectangular, block, and, taking, the, four, lower, corners, off, at, an, angle, so, that, the, block, was, square, at, the, top, but, octagonal, at, the, bottom, as, can, be, seen, at, st, michael, s, hildesheim, this, shape, lent, itself, to, a, wide, variety, of, superficial, treatments, sometimes, foliate, in, imitation, of, the, source, but, often, figurative, in, northern, europe, the, foliate, capitals, generally, bear, far, more, resemblance, to, the, intricacies, of, manuscript, illumination, than, to, classical, sources, in, parts, of, france, and, italy, there, are, strong, links, to, the, pierced, capitals, of, byzantine, architecture, it, is, in, the, figurative, capitals, that, the, greatest, originality, is, shown, while, some, are, dependent, on, manuscripts, illustrations, of, biblical, scenes, and, depictions, of, beasts, and, monsters, others, are, lively, scenes, of, the, legends, of, local, saints, the, capitals, while, retaining, the, form, of, a, square, top, and, a, round, bottom, were, often, compressed, into, little, more, than, a, bulging, cushion, shape, this, is, particularly, the, case, on, large, masonry, columns, or, on, large, columns, that, alternate, with, piers, as, at, durham, see, illustrated, above, the, majority, of, buildings, have, wooden, roofs, generally, of, a, simple, truss, tie, beam, or, king, post, form, in, the, case, of, trussed, rafter, roofs, they, are, sometimes, lined, with, wooden, ceilings, in, three, sections, like, those, that, survive, at, ely, and, peterborough, cathedrals, in, england, in, churches, typically, the, aisles, are, vaulted, but, the, nave, is, roofed, with, timber, as, is, the, case, at, both, peterborough, and, ely, in, italy, where, open, wooden, roofs, are, common, and, tie, beams, frequently, occur, in, conjunction, with, vaults, the, timbers, have, often, been, decorated, as, at, san, miniato, al, monte, florence, vaults, of, stone, or, brick, took, on, several, different, forms, and, showed, marked, development, during, the, period, evolving, into, the, pointed, ribbed, arch, characteristic, of, gothic, architecture, the, simplest, type, of, vaulted, roof, is, the, barrel, vault, in, which, a, single, arched, surface, extends, from, wall, to, wall, the, length, of, the, space, to, be, vaulted, for, example, the, nave, of, a, church, an, important, example, which, retains, medieval, paintings, is, the, vault, of, saint, savin, sur, gartempe, france, of, the, early, 12th, century, however, the, barrel, vault, generally, required, the, support, of, solid, walls, or, walls, in, which, the, windows, were, very, small, groin, vaults, occur, in, early, romanesque, buildings, notably, at, speyer, cathedral, where, the, high, vault, of, about, 1060, is, the, first, employment, in, romanesque, architecture, of, this, type, of, vault, for, a, wide, nave, in, later, buildings, employing, ribbed, vaultings, groin, vaults, are, most, frequently, used, for, the, less, visible, and, smaller, vaults, particularly, in, crypts, and, aisles, a, groin, vault, is, almost, always, square, in, plan, and, is, constructed, of, two, barrel, vaults, intersecting, at, right, angles, unlike, a, ribbed, vault, the, entire, arch, is, a, structural, member, groin, vaults, are, frequently, separated, by, transverse, arched, ribs, of, low, profile, as, at, speyer, and, santiago, de, compostela, at, sainte, marie, madeleine, v, zelay, the, ribs, are, square, in, section, strongly, projecting, and, polychrome, ribbed, vaults, came, into, general, use, in, the, 12th, century, in, ribbed, vaults, not, only, are, there, ribs, spanning, the, vaulted, area, transversely, but, each, vaulted, bay, has, diagonal, ribs, following, the, same, course, as, the, groins, in, a, groin, vault, however, whereas, in, a, groin, vault, the, vault, itself, is, the, structural, member, in, a, ribbed, vault, it, is, the, ribs, that, are, the, structural, members, and, the, spaces, between, them, can, be, filled, with, lighter, non, structural, material, because, romanesque, arches, are, nearly, always, semi, circular, the, structural, and, design, problem, inherent, in, the, ribbed, vault, is, that, the, diagonal, span, is, larger, and, therefore, higher, than, the, transverse, span, the, romanesque, builders, used, a, number, of, solutions, to, this, problem, one, was, to, have, the, centre, point, where, the, diagonal, ribs, met, as, the, highest, point, with, the, infill, of, all, the, surfaces, sloping, upwards, towards, it, in, a, domical, manner, this, solution, was, employed, in, italy, at, san, michele, pavia, and, sant, ambrogio, milan, the, solution, employed, in, england, was, to, stilt, the, transverse, ribs, maintaining, a, horizontal, central, line, to, the, roof, like, that, of, a, barrel, vault, the, diagonal, ribs, could, also, be, depressed, a, solution, used, on, the, sexpartite, vaults, at, both, the, saint, tienne, abbaye, aux, hommes, and, sainte, trinit, abbaye, aux, dames, at, caen, france, in, the, late, 11th, and, early, 12th, centuries, the, problems, encountered, in, the, structure, and, appearance, of, vaults, was, solved, late, in, the, romanesque, period, with, the, introduction, of, pointed, arched, ribs, which, allowed, the, height, of, both, diagonal, and, transverse, ribs, to, be, varied, in, proportion, to, each, other, pointed, ribs, made, their, first, appearance, in, the, transverse, ribs, of, the, vaults, at, durham, cathedral, in, northern, england, dating, from, 1128, durham, is, a, cathedral, of, massive, romanesque, proportions, and, appearance, yet, its, builders, introduced, several, structural, features, that, were, new, to, architectural, design, and, were, later, to, be, hallmark, features, of, the, gothic, style, another, gothic, structural, feature, employed, at, durham, is, the, flying, buttress, however, these, are, hidden, beneath, the, roofs, of, the, aisles, the, earliest, pointed, vault, in, france, is, that, of, the, narthex, of, la, madeleine, v, zelay, dating, from, 1130, they, were, subsequently, employed, with, the, development, of, the, gothic, style, at, the, east, end, of, the, basilica, of, st, denis, in, paris, in, 1140, an, early, ribbed, vault, in, the, romanesque, architecture, of, sicily, is, that, of, the, chancel, at, the, cathedral, of, cefal, domes, in, romanesque, architecture, are, generally, found, within, crossing, towers, at, the, intersection, of, a, church, s, nave, and, transept, which, conceal, the, domes, externally, called, a, tiburio, this, tower, like, structure, often, has, a, blind, arcade, near, the, roof, romanesque, domes, are, typically, octagonal, in, plan, and, use, corner, squinches, to, translate, a, square, bay, into, a, suitable, octagonal, base, octagonal, cloister, vaults, appear, in, connection, with, basilicas, almost, throughout, europe, between, 1050, and, 1100, the, precise, form, differs, from, region, to, region, many, parish, churches, abbey, churches, and, cathedrals, are, in, the, romanesque, style, or, were, originally, built, in, the, romanesque, style, and, have, subsequently, undergone, changes, the, simplest, romanesque, churches, are, aisleless, halls, with, a, projecting, apse, at, the, chancel, end, or, sometimes, particularly, in, england, a, projecting, rectangular, chancel, with, a, chancel, arch, that, might, be, decorated, with, mouldings, more, ambitious, churches, have, aisles, separated, from, the, nave, by, arcades, abbey, and, cathedral, churches, generally, follow, the, latin, cross, plan, in, england, the, extension, eastward, may, be, long, while, in, italy, it, is, often, short, or, non, existent, the, church, being, of, t, plan, sometimes, with, apses, on, the, transept, ends, as, well, as, to, the, east, in, france, the, church, of, st, front, p, rigueux, appears, to, have, been, modelled, on, st, mark, s, basilica, venice, or, the, byzantine, church, of, the, holy, apostles, and, is, of, a, greek, cross, plan, with, five, domes, in, the, same, region, angoul, me, cathedral, is, an, aisleless, church, of, the, latin, cross, plan, more, usual, in, france, but, is, also, roofed, with, domes, in, germany, romanesque, churches, are, often, of, distinctive, form, having, apses, at, both, east, and, west, ends, the, main, entrance, being, central, to, one, side, it, is, probable, that, this, form, came, about, to, accommodate, a, baptistery, at, the, west, end, note, the, plans, below, do, not, show, the, buildings, in, their, current, states, the, abbey, church, of, st, gall, switzerland, shows, the, plan, that, was, to, become, common, throughout, germanic, europe, it, is, a, latin, cross, with, a, comparatively, long, nave, and, short, transepts, and, eastern, end, which, is, apsidal, the, nave, is, aisled, but, the, chancel, and, transepts, are, not, it, has, an, apsidal, west, end, which, was, to, become, a, feature, of, churches, of, germany, such, as, worms, cathedral, speyer, cathedral, germany, also, has, aisleless, transept, and, chancel, it, has, a, markedly, modular, look, a, typical, germanic, characteristic, is, the, presence, of, towers, framing, the, chancel, and, the, west, end, there, is, marked, emphasis, on, the, western, entrance, called, westwerk, which, is, seen, in, several, other, churches, each, vault, compartment, covers, two, narrow, bays, of, the, nave, at, autun, cathedral, france, the, pattern, of, the, nave, bays, and, aisles, extends, beyond, the, crossing, and, into, the, chancel, each, aisle, terminating, in, an, apse, each, nave, bay, is, separated, at, the, vault, by, a, transverse, rib, each, transept, projects, to, the, width, of, two, nave, bays, the, entrance, has, a, narthex, which, screens, the, main, portal, this, type, of, entrance, was, to, be, elaborated, in, the, gothic, period, on, the, transepts, at, chartres, angoul, me, cathedral, france, is, one, of, several, instances, in, which, the, byzantine, churches, of, constantinople, seem, to, have, been, influential, in, the, design, in, which, the, main, spaces, are, roofed, by, domes, this, structure, has, necessitated, the, use, of, very, thick, walls, and, massive, piers, from, which, the, domes, spring, there, are, radiating, chapels, around, the, apse, which, is, a, typically, french, feature, and, was, to, evolve, into, the, chevet, as, was, typically, the, case, in, england, ely, cathedral, was, a, benedictine, monastery, serving, both, monastic, and, secular, function, to, facilitate, this, the, chancel, or, presbytery, is, longer, than, usually, found, in, europe, as, are, the, aisled, transepts, which, contained, chapels, in, england, emphasis, was, placed, on, the, orientation, of, the, chapels, to, the, east, the, very, large, piers, at, the, crossing, signify, that, there, was, once, a, tower, the, western, end, having, two, round, towers, flanking, a, tall, central, tower, was, unique, in, britain, ely, cathedral, was, never, vaulted, and, retains, a, wooden, ceiling, over, the, nave, the, cathedral, of, santiago, de, compostela, shares, many, features, with, ely, but, is, typically, spanish, in, its, expansive, appearance, santiago, held, the, body, of, st, james, and, was, the, most, significant, pilgrimage, site, in, europe, the, narthex, the, aisles, the, large, aisled, transepts, and, numerous, projecting, chapels, reflect, this, the, chancel, is, short, compared, to, that, of, ely, and, the, altar, set, so, as, to, provide, clear, view, to, a, vast, congregation, simultaneously, the, basilica, saint, sernin, of, toulouse, is, a, typical, example, of, a, pilgrimage, church, it, is, very, large, and, its, interior, plan, made, it, possible, to, direct, traffic, with, double, side, aisles, and, with, an, aisled, transept, and, an, ambulatory, surrounding, the, apse, pilgrims, could, make, the, circuit, around, the, church, and, were, able, to, stop, for, meditation, and, prayer, at, the, apsidal, chapels, of, the, transept, and, the, radiating, chapels, of, the, choir, modena, cathedral, shows, a, typically, italian, romanesque, plan, often, architecturally, termed, a, basilica, because, of, its, similarity, in, plan, to, a, roman, basilicas, in, section, the, typical, aisled, church, or, cathedral, has, a, nave, with, a, single, aisle, on, either, side, the, nave, and, aisles, are, separated, by, an, arcade, carried, on, piers, or, on, columns, the, roof, of, the, aisle, and, the, outer, walls, help, to, buttress, the, upper, walls, and, vault, of, the, nave, if, present, above, the, aisle, roof, are, a, row, of, windows, known, as, the, clerestory, which, give, light, to, the, nave, during, the, romanesque, period, there, was, a, development, from, this, two, stage, elevation, to, a, three, stage, elevation, in, which, there, is, a, gallery, known, as, a, triforium, between, the, arcade, and, the, clerestory, this, varies, from, a, simple, blind, arcade, decorating, the, walls, to, a, narrow, arcaded, passage, to, a, fully, developed, second, story, with, a, row, of, windows, lighting, the, gallery, the, eastern, end, of, a, romanesque, church, is, almost, always, semi, circular, with, either, a, high, chancel, surrounded, by, an, ambulatory, as, in, france, or, a, square, end, from, which, an, apse, projects, as, in, germany, and, italy, where, square, ends, exist, in, english, churches, they, are, probably, influenced, by, anglo, saxon, churches, peterborough, and, norwich, cathedrals, have, retained, round, east, ends, in, the, french, style, however, in, france, simple, churches, without, apses, and, with, no, decorative, features, were, built, by, the, cistercians, who, also, founded, many, houses, in, england, frequently, in, remote, areas, romanesque, church, fa, ades, generally, to, the, west, end, of, the, building, are, usually, symmetrical, have, a, large, central, portal, made, significant, by, its, mouldings, or, porch, and, an, arrangement, of, arched, topped, windows, in, italy, there, is, often, a, single, central, ocular, or, wheel, window, the, common, decorative, feature, is, arcading, smaller, churches, often, have, a, single, tower, that, is, usually, placed, to, the, western, end, in, france, or, england, either, centrally, or, to, one, side, while, larger, churches, and, cathedrals, often, have, two, in, france, saint, tienne, caen, presents, the, model, of, a, large, french, romanesque, fa, ade, it, is, a, symmetrical, arrangement, of, nave, flanked, by, two, tall, towers, each, with, two, buttresses, of, low, flat, profile, that, divide, the, fa, ade, into, three, vertical, units, the, lowest, stage, is, marked, by, large, doors, each, set, within, an, arch, in, each, of, the, three, vertical, sections, the, wider, central, section, has, two, tiers, of, three, identical, windows, while, in, the, outer, sections, there, are, two, tiers, of, single, windows, giving, emphasis, to, the, mass, of, the, towers, the, towers, rise, above, the, fa, ade, through, three, further, tiers, the, lowest, of, tall, blind, arcading, the, next, of, arcading, pierced, by, two, narrow, windows, and, the, third, of, two, large, windows, divided, into, two, lights, by, a, colonnette, this, fa, ade, can, be, seen, as, the, foundation, for, many, other, buildings, including, both, french, and, english, gothic, churches, while, the, form, is, typical, of, northern, france, its, various, components, were, common, to, many, romanesque, churches, of, the, period, across, europe, similar, fa, ades, are, found, in, portugal, in, england, southwell, cathedral, has, maintained, this, form, despite, the, insertion, of, a, huge, gothic, window, between, the, towers, lincoln, and, durham, must, once, have, looked, like, this, in, germany, limburg, cathedral, has, a, rich, variety, of, openings, and, arcades, in, horizontal, storeys, of, varying, heights, the, churches, of, san, zeno, maggiore, verona, and, san, michele, pavia, present, two, types, of, fa, ade, that, are, typical, of, italian, romanesque, that, which, reveals, the, architectural, form, of, the, building, and, that, which, screens, it, at, san, zeno, the, components, of, nave, and, aisles, are, made, clear, by, the, vertical, shafts, that, rise, to, the, level, of, the, central, gable, and, by, the, varying, roof, levels, at, san, miniato, al, monte, the, definition, of, the, architectural, parts, is, made, even, clearer, by, the, polychrome, marble, a, feature, of, many, italian, medieval, fa, ades, particularly, in, tuscany, at, san, michele, the, vertical, definition, is, present, as, at, san, zeno, but, the, rooflines, are, screened, behind, a, single, large, gable, decorated, with, stepped, arcading, at, santa, maria, della, pieve, arezzo, this, screening, is, carried, even, further, as, the, roofline, is, horizontal, and, the, arcading, rises, in, many, different, levels, while, the, colonettes, that, support, them, have, a, great, diversity, of, decoration, in, the, rhineland, and, netherlands, the, carolingian, form, of, west, end, known, as, the, westwerk, prevailed, towers, and, apse, of, the, western, end, are, often, incorporated, into, a, multi, storey, structure, that, bears, little, structural, or, visual, relationship, to, the, building, behind, it, these, westwerks, take, a, great, variety, of, forms, as, may, be, seen, at, maria, laach, abbey, st, gertrude, nivelles, and, st, serviatius, maastricht, towers, were, an, important, feature, of, romanesque, churches, and, a, great, number, of, them, are, still, standing, they, take, a, variety, of, forms, square, circular, and, octagonal, and, are, positioned, differently, in, relation, to, the, church, building, in, different, countries, in, northern, france, two, large, towers, such, as, those, at, caen, were, to, become, an, integral, part, of, the, fa, ade, of, any, large, abbey, or, cathedral, in, central, and, southern, france, this, is, more, variable, and, large, churches, may, have, one, tower, or, a, central, tower, large, churches, of, spain, and, portugal, usually, have, two, towers, many, abbeys, of, france, such, as, that, at, cluny, had, many, towers, of, varied, forms, this, is, also, common, in, germany, where, the, apses, were, sometimes, framed, with, circular, towers, and, the, crossing, surmounted, by, an, octagonal, tower, as, at, worms, cathedral, large, paired, towers, of, square, plan, could, also, occur, on, the, transept, ends, such, as, those, at, tournai, cathedral, in, belgium, in, germany, where, four, towers, frequently, occur, they, often, have, spires, that, may, be, four, or, eight, sided, or, the, distinctive, rhenish, helm, shape, seen, on, the, cathedrals, of, limburg, or, speyer, in, england, for, large, abbeys, and, cathedral, buildings, three, towers, were, favoured, with, the, central, tower, being, the, tallest, this, was, often, not, achieved, through, the, slow, process, of, the, building, stages, and, in, many, cases, the, upper, parts, of, the, tower, were, not, completed, until, centuries, later, as, at, durham, and, lincoln, large, norman, towers, exist, at, the, cathedrals, of, durham, exeter, southwell, norwich, and, tewkesbury, abbey, such, towers, were, often, topped, during, the, late, medieval, period, with, a, gothic, spire, of, wooden, construction, covered, with, lead, copper, or, shingles, in, the, case, of, norwich, cathedral, the, huge, ornate, 12th, century, crossing, tower, received, a, 15th, century, masonry, spire, rising, to, a, height, of, 320, feet, and, remaining, to, this, day, in, italy, towers, are, almost, always, free, standing, and, the, position, is, often, dictated, by, the, landform, of, the, site, rather, than, aesthetics, this, is, the, case, in, nearly, all, italian, churches, both, large, and, small, except, in, sicily, where, a, number, of, churches, were, founded, by, the, norman, rulers, and, are, more, french, in, appearance, as, a, general, rule, large, romanesque, towers, are, square, with, corner, buttresses, of, low, profile, rising, without, diminishing, through, the, various, stages, towers, are, usually, marked, into, clearly, defined, stages, by, horizontal, courses, as, the, towers, rise, the, number, and, size, of, openings, increases, as, can, be, seen, on, the, right, tower, of, the, transept, of, tournai, cathedral, where, two, narrow, slits, in, the, fourth, level, from, the, top, becomes, a, single, window, then, two, windows, then, three, windows, at, the, uppermost, level, this, sort, of, arrangement, is, particularly, noticeable, on, the, towers, of, italian, churches, which, are, usually, built, of, brick, and, may, have, no, other, ornament, two, fine, examples, occur, at, lucca, at, the, church, of, san, frediano, and, at, the, duomo, it, is, also, seen, in, spain, in, italy, there, are, a, number, of, large, free, standing, towers, that, are, circular, the, most, famous, of, these, being, the, leaning, tower, of, pisa, in, other, countries, where, circular, towers, occur, such, as, germany, they, are, usually, paired, and, often, flank, an, apse, circular, towers, are, uncommon, in, england, but, occur, throughout, the, early, medieval, period, in, ireland, polygonal, towers, were, often, used, on, crossings, and, occur, in, france, germany, italy, and, spain, such, as, that, of, the, old, cathedral, salamanca, which, is, covered, by, a, dome, supported, on, a, ribbed, vault, smaller, churches, sometimes, had, bell, gables, instead, of, towers, a, feature, which, according, to, some, authors, is, characteristic, of, the, simplicity, of, much, architecture, in, the, romanesque, style, romanesque, churches, generally, have, a, single, portal, centrally, placed, on, the, west, front, the, focus, of, decoration, for, the, fa, ade, of, the, building, some, churches, such, as, saint, tienne, caen, 11th, century, and, pisa, cathedral, late, 12th, century, had, three, western, portals, in, the, manner, of, early, christian, basilicas, many, churches, both, large, and, small, had, lateral, entrances, that, were, commonly, used, by, worshippers, romanesque, doorways, have, a, character, form, with, the, jambs, having, a, series, of, receding, planes, into, each, of, which, is, set, a, circular, shaft, all, surmounted, by, a, continuous, abacus, the, semi, circular, arch, which, rises, from, the, abacus, has, the, same, series, planes, and, circular, mouldings, as, the, jambs, there, are, typically, four, planes, containing, three, shafts, but, there, may, be, as, many, as, twelve, shafts, symbolic, of, the, apostles, the, opening, of, the, portal, may, be, arched, or, may, be, set, with, a, lintel, supporting, a, tympanum, generally, carved, but, in, italy, sometimes, decorated, with, mosaic, or, fresco, a, carved, tympanum, generally, constitutes, the, major, sculptural, work, of, a, romanesque, church, the, subject, of, the, carving, on, a, major, portal, may, be, christ, in, majesty, or, the, last, judgement, lateral, doors, may, include, other, subjects, such, as, the, birth, of, christ, the, portal, may, be, protected, by, a, porch, with, simple, open, porches, being, typical, of, italy, and, more, elaborate, structures, typical, of, france, and, spain, the, structure, of, large, churches, differed, regionally, and, developed, across, the, centuries, the, use, of, piers, of, rectangular, plan, to, support, arcades, was, common, as, at, mainz, cathedral, and, st, gertrude, nivelle, and, remained, usual, in, smaller, churches, across, europe, with, the, arcades, often, taking, the, form, of, openings, through, the, surface, of, a, wall, in, italy, where, there, was, a, strong, tradition, of, using, marble, columns, complete, with, capital, base, and, abacus, this, remained, prevalent, often, reusing, existent, ancient, columns, as, at, san, miniato, al, monte, a, number, of, 11th, century, churches, have, naves, distinguished, by, huge, circular, columns, with, no, clerestory, or, a, very, small, one, as, at, st, philibert, tournus, in, england, stout, columns, of, large, diameter, supported, decorated, arches, gallery, and, clerestory, as, at, the, nave, of, malmesbury, abbey, see, piers, and, columns, above, by, the, early, 12th, century, composite, piers, had, evolved, in, which, the, attached, shafts, swept, upward, to, a, ribbed, vault, or, were, continued, into, the, mouldings, of, the, arcade, as, at, v, zelay, abbey, saint, tienne, caen, and, peterborough, cathedral, the, nature, of, the, internal, roofing, varied, greatly, from, open, timber, roofs, and, wooden, ceilings, of, different, types, which, remained, common, in, smaller, churches, to, simple, barrel, vaults, and, groin, vaults, and, increasingly, to, the, use, of, ribbed, vaults, in, the, late, 11th, and, 12th, centuries, which, were, to, become, a, common, feature, of, larger, abbey, churches, and, cathedrals, a, number, of, romanesque, churches, are, roofed, with, a, series, of, domes, at, fontevrault, abbey, the, nave, is, covered, by, four, domes, while, at, the, church, of, saint, front, p, rigueux, the, church, is, of, greek, cross, plan, with, a, central, dome, surrounded, by, four, smaller, domes, over, the, nave, chancel, and, transepts, internal, decoration, varied, across, europe, where, wide, expanses, of, wall, existed, they, were, often, plastered, and, painted, wooden, ceilings, and, timber, beams, were, decorated, in, italy, walls, were, sometimes, faced, with, polychrome, marble, where, buildings, were, constructed, of, stone, that, was, suitable, for, carving, many, decorative, details, occur, including, ornate, capitals, and, mouldings, the, apsidal, east, end, was, often, a, focus, of, decoration, with, both, architectonic, forms, such, as, arcading, and, pictorial, features, such, as, carved, figures, murals, and, occasionally, mosaics, stained, glass, came, into, increasing, use, from, the, 11th, century, in, many, churches, the, eastern, end, has, been, rebuilt, in, a, later, style, of, england, s, norman, cathedrals, no, eastern, end, remains, unchanged, in, france, the, eastern, terminals, of, the, important, abbeys, of, caen, v, zelay, and, most, significantly, the, basilica, of, st, denis, were, completely, rebuilt, in, the, gothic, style, in, germany, major, reconstructions, of, the, 19th, century, sought, to, return, many, romanesque, buildings, to, their, original, form, examples, of, simple, romanesque, apses, can, be, seen, in, the, images, of, st, gertrude, nivelles, st, philibert, tournus, and, san, miniato, al, monte, among, the, structures, associated, with, church, buildings, are, crypts, porches, chapter, houses, cloisters, and, baptisteries, crypts, are, often, present, as, an, underlying, structure, to, a, substantial, church, and, are, generally, a, completely, discrete, space, but, occasionally, as, in, some, italian, churches, may, be, a, sunken, space, under, a, raised, chancel, and, open, via, steps, to, the, body, of, the, nave, romanesque, crypts, have, survived, in, many, instances, such, as, canterbury, cathedral, when, the, church, itself, has, been, rebuilt, the, usual, construction, of, a, romanesque, crypt, is, with, many, short, stout, columns, carrying, groin, vaults, as, at, worcester, cathedral, porches, sometimes, occur, as, part, of, the, original, design, of, a, fa, ade, this, is, very, much, the, case, in, italy, where, they, are, usually, only, one, bay, deep, and, are, supported, on, two, columns, often, resting, on, couchant, lions, as, at, st, zeno, verona, see, above, elsewhere, porches, of, various, dates, have, been, added, to, the, fa, ade, or, side, entrance, of, existent, churches, and, may, be, quite, a, substantial, structure, with, several, bays, of, vaulting, supported, on, an, open, or, partially, open, arcade, and, forming, a, sort, of, narthex, as, at, the, church, of, st, maria, laach, see, above, in, spain, romanesque, churches, often, have, large, lateral, porches, like, loggias, chapter, houses, often, occur, adjacent, to, monastic, or, cathedral, churches, few, have, survived, intact, from, the, romanesque, period, early, chapter, houses, were, rectangular, in, shape, with, the, larger, ones, sometimes, having, groin, or, ribbed, vaults, supported, on, columns, later, romanesque, chapter, houses, sometimes, had, an, apsidal, eastern, end, the, chapter, house, at, durham, cathedral, is, a, wide, space, with, a, ribbed, vault, restored, as, originally, constructed, in, 1130, the, circular, chapter, house, at, worcester, cathedral, built, by, bishop, wulfstan, 1062, 95, was, the, first, circular, chapter, house, in, europe, and, was, much, imitated, in, england, cloisters, are, generally, part, of, any, monastic, complex, and, also, occur, at, cathedral, and, collegiate, churches, they, were, essential, to, the, communal, way, of, life, a, place, for, both, working, during, daylight, hours, and, relaxing, during, inclement, weather, they, usually, abut, the, church, building, and, are, enclosed, with, windowless, walls, on, the, outside, and, an, open, arcade, on, the, inside, looking, over, a, courtyard, or, cloister, garth, they, may, be, vaulted, or, have, timber, roofs, the, arcades, are, often, richly, decorated, and, are, home, to, some, of, the, most, fanciful, carved, capitals, of, the, romanesque, period, with, those, of, santo, domingo, de, silos, in, spain, and, the, abbey, of, st, pierre, moissac, being, examples, many, romanesque, cloisters, have, survived, in, spain, france, italy, and, germany, along, with, some, of, their, associated, buildings, baptisteries, often, occur, in, italy, as, a, free, standing, structure, associated, with, a, cathedral, they, are, generally, octagonal, or, circular, and, domed, the, interior, may, be, arcaded, on, several, levels, as, at, pisa, cathedral, other, notable, romanesque, baptisteries, are, that, at, parma, cathedral, remarkable, for, its, galleried, exterior, and, the, polychrome, baptistery, of, san, giovanni, of, florence, cathedral, with, vault, mosaics, of, the, 13th, century, including, christ, in, majesty, possibly, the, work, of, the, almost, legendary, coppo, di, marcovaldo, arcading, is, the, single, most, significant, decorative, feature, of, romanesque, architecture, it, occurs, in, a, variety, of, forms, from, the, lombard, band, which, is, a, row, of, small, arches, that, appear, to, support, a, roofline, or, course, to, shallow, blind, arcading, that, is, often, a, feature, of, english, architecture, and, is, seen, in, great, variety, at, ely, cathedral, to, the, open, dwarf, gallery, first, used, at, speyer, cathedral, and, widely, adopted, in, italy, as, seen, on, both, pisa, cathedral, and, its, famous, leaning, tower, arcades, could, be, used, to, great, effect, both, externally, and, internally, as, exemplified, by, the, church, of, santa, maria, della, pieve, in, arezzo, the, romanesque, period, produced, a, profusion, of, sculptural, ornamentation, this, most, frequently, took, a, purely, geometric, form, and, was, particularly, applied, to, mouldings, both, straight, courses, and, the, curved, moldings, of, arches, in, la, madeleine, vezelay, for, example, the, polychrome, ribs, of, the, vault, are, all, edged, with, narrow, filets, of, pierced, stone, similar, decoration, occurs, around, the, arches, of, the, nave, and, along, the, horizontal, course, separating, arcade, and, clerestory, combined, with, the, pierced, carving, of, the, capitals, this, gives, a, delicacy, and, refinement, to, the, interior, in, england, such, decoration, could, be, discrete, as, at, hereford, and, peterborough, cathedrals, or, have, a, sense, of, massive, energy, as, at, durham, where, the, diagonal, ribs, of, the, vaults, are, all, outlined, with, chevrons, the, mouldings, of, the, nave, arcade, are, carved, with, several, layers, of, the, same, and, the, huge, columns, are, deeply, incised, with, a, variety, of, geometric, patterns, creating, an, impression, of, directional, movement, these, features, combine, to, create, one, of, the, richest, and, most, dynamic, interiors, of, the, romanesque, period, although, much, sculptural, ornament, was, sometimes, applied, to, the, interiors, of, churches, the, focus, of, such, decoration, was, generally, the, west, front, and, in, particular, the, portals, chevrons, and, other, geometric, ornaments, referred, to, by, 19th, century, writers, as, barbaric, ornament, are, most, frequently, found, on, the, mouldings, of, the, central, door, stylized, foliage, often, appears, sometimes, deeply, carved, and, curling, outward, after, the, manner, of, the, acanthus, leaves, on, corinthian, capitals, but, also, carved, in, shallow, relief, and, spiral, patterns, imitating, the, intricacies, of, manuscript, illuminations, in, general, the, style, of, ornament, was, more, classical, in, italy, such, as, that, seen, around, the, door, of, san, giusto, in, lucca, and, more, barbaric, in, england, germany, and, scandinavia, such, as, that, seen, at, lincoln, and, speyer, cathedrals, france, produced, a, great, range, of, ornament, with, particularly, fine, interwoven, and, spiralling, vines, in, the, manuscript, style, occurring, at, saint, sernin, toulouse, the, name, of, the, architectural, style, was, transferred, onto, the, art, of, he, period, romanesque, art, provided, fine, examples, of, painting, and, sculpture, but, while, the, romanesque, churches, were, flush, with, colours, most, large, paintings, were, lost, the, period, brought, a, major, revival, of, sculpture, with, the, fall, of, the, roman, empire, the, tradition, of, carving, large, works, in, stone, and, sculpting, figures, in, bronze, died, out, the, best, known, surviving, large, sculptural, work, of, proto, romanesque, europe, is, the, life, size, wooden, crucifix, commissioned, by, archbishop, gero, of, cologne, in, about, 960, 65, during, the, 11th, and, 12th, centuries, figurative, sculpture, flourished, in, a, distinctly, romanesque, style, that, can, be, recognised, across, europe, although, the, most, spectacular, sculptural, projects, are, concentrated, in, south, western, france, northern, spain, and, italy, major, figurative, decoration, occurs, particularly, around, the, portals, of, cathedrals, and, churches, ornamenting, the, tympanum, lintels, jambs, and, central, posts, the, tympanum, is, typically, decorated, with, the, imagery, of, christ, in, majesty, with, the, symbols, of, the, four, evangelists, drawn, directly, from, the, gilt, covers, of, medieval, gospel, books, this, style, of, doorway, occurs, in, many, places, and, continued, into, the, gothic, period, a, rare, survival, in, england, is, that, of, the, prior, s, door, at, ely, cathedral, in, france, many, have, survived, with, impressive, examples, at, the, abbey, of, saint, pierre, moissac, the, abbey, of, sainte, marie, souillac, and, abbey, of, la, madaleine, v, zelay, all, daughter, houses, of, cluny, with, extensive, other, sculpture, remaining, in, cloisters, and, other, buildings, nearby, autun, cathedral, has, a, last, judgement, of, great, rarity, in, that, it, has, uniquely, been, signed, by, its, creator, giselbertus, who, was, perhaps, the, patron, rather, than, the, sculptor, the, same, artist, is, thought, to, have, worked, at, la, madeleine, vezelay, which, uniquely, has, two, elaborately, carved, tympanum, the, early, inner, one, representing, the, last, judgement, and, that, on, the, outer, portal, of, the, narthex, representing, jesus, sending, forth, the, apostles, to, preach, to, the, nations, it, is, a, feature, of, romanesque, art, both, in, manuscript, illumination, and, sculptural, decoration, that, figures, are, contorted, to, fit, the, space, that, they, occupy, among, the, many, examples, that, exist, one, of, the, finest, is, the, figure, of, the, prophet, jeremiah, from, the, pillar, of, the, portal, of, the, abbey, of, saint, pierre, moissac, france, from, about, 1130, a, significant, motif, of, romanesque, design, is, the, spiral, a, form, applied, to, both, plant, motifs, and, drapery, in, romanesque, sculpture, an, outstanding, example, of, its, use, in, drapery, is, that, of, the, central, figure, of, christ, on, the, outer, portal, at, la, madaleine, vezelay, many, of, the, smaller, sculptural, works, particularly, capitals, are, biblical, in, subject, and, include, scenes, of, creation, and, the, fall, of, man, episodes, from, the, life, of, christ, and, those, old, testament, scenes, that, prefigure, his, death, and, resurrection, such, as, jonah, and, the, whale, and, daniel, in, the, lions, den, many, nativity, scenes, occur, the, theme, of, the, three, kings, being, particularly, popular, the, cloisters, of, santo, domingo, de, silos, abbey, in, northern, spain, and, moissac, are, fine, examples, surviving, complete, the, large, wall, surfaces, and, plain, curving, vaults, of, the, romanesque, period, lent, themselves, to, mural, decoration, many, of, these, early, wall, paintings, have, been, destroyed, by, damp, or, the, walls, have, been, replastered, and, painted, over, in, most, of, northern, europe, such, pictures, were, systematically, destroyed, in, bouts, of, reformation, iconoclasm, in, other, countries, they, have, suffered, from, war, neglect, and, changing, fashion, a, classic, scheme, for, the, full, painted, decoration, of, a, church, derived, from, earlier, examples, often, in, mosaic, had, as, its, focal, point, in, the, semi, dome, of, the, apse, christ, in, majesty, or, christ, the, redeemer, enthroned, within, a, mandorla, and, framed, by, the, four, winged, beasts, symbols, of, the, four, evangelists, comparing, directly, with, examples, from, the, gilt, covers, or, the, illuminations, of, gospel, books, of, the, period, if, the, virgin, mary, was, the, dedicatee, of, the, church, she, might, replace, christ, here, on, the, apse, walls, below, would, be, saints, and, apostles, perhaps, including, narrative, scenes, for, example, of, the, saint, to, whom, the, church, was, dedicated, on, the, sanctuary, arch, were, figures, of, apostles, prophets, or, the, twenty, four, elders, of, the, apocalypse, looking, in, towards, a, bust, of, christ, or, his, symbol, the, lamb, at, the, top, of, the, arch, the, north, wall, of, the, nave, would, contain, narrative, scenes, from, the, old, testament, and, the, south, wall, from, the, new, testament, on, the, rear, west, wall, would, be, a, doom, painting, or, last, judgement, with, an, enthroned, and, judging, christ, at, the, top, one, of, the, most, intact, schemes, to, exist, is, that, at, saint, savin, sur, gartempe, in, france, see, picture, above, under, vault, the, long, barrel, vault, of, the, nave, provides, an, excellent, surface, for, fresco, and, is, decorated, with, scenes, of, the, old, testament, showing, the, creation, the, fall, of, man, and, other, stories, including, a, lively, depiction, of, noah, s, ark, complete, with, a, fearsome, figurehead, and, numerous, windows, through, with, can, be, seen, the, noah, and, his, family, on, the, upper, deck, birds, on, the, middle, deck, while, on, the, lower, are, the, pairs, of, animals, another, scene, shows, with, great, vigour, the, swamping, of, pharaoh, s, army, by, the, red, sea, the, scheme, extends, to, other, parts, of, the, church, with, the, martyrdom, of, the, local, saints, shown, in, the, crypt, and, apocalypse, in, the, narthex, and, christ, in, majesty, the, range, of, colours, employed, is, limited, to, light, blue, green, yellow, ochre, reddish, brown, and, black, similar, paintings, exist, in, serbia, spain, germany, italy, and, elsewhere, in, france, the, oldest, known, fragments, of, medieval, pictorial, stained, glass, appear, to, date, from, the, 10th, century, the, earliest, intact, figures, are, five, prophet, windows, at, augsburg, dating, from, the, late, 11th, century, the, figures, though, stiff, and, formalised, demonstrate, considerable, proficiency, in, design, both, pictorially, and, in, the, functional, use, of, the, glass, indicating, that, their, maker, was, well, accustomed, to, the, medium, at, canterbury, and, chartres, cathedrals, a, number, of, panels, of, the, 12th, century, have, survived, including, at, canterbury, a, figure, of, adam, digging, and, another, of, his, son, seth, from, a, series, of, ancestors, of, christ, adam, represents, a, highly, naturalistic, and, lively, portrayal, while, in, the, figure, of, seth, the, robes, have, been, used, to, great, decorative, effect, similar, to, the, best, stone, carving, of, the, period, many, of, the, magnificent, stained, glass, windows, of, france, including, the, famous, windows, of, chartres, date, from, the, 13th, century, far, fewer, large, windows, remain, intact, from, the, 12th, century, one, such, is, the, crucifixion, of, poitiers, a, remarkable, composition, that, rises, through, three, stages, the, lowest, with, a, quatrefoil, depicting, the, martyrdom, of, st, peter, the, largest, central, stage, dominated, by, the, crucifixion, and, the, upper, stage, showing, the, ascension, of, christ, in, a, mandorla, the, figure, of, the, crucified, christ, is, already, showing, the, gothic, curve, the, window, is, described, by, george, seddon, as, being, of, unforgettable, beauty, during, the, 12th, century, features, that, were, to, become, typical, of, gothic, architecture, began, to, appear, it, is, not, uncommon, for, example, for, a, part, of, building, that, has, been, constructed, over, a, lengthy, period, extending, into, the, 12th, century, to, have, very, similar, arcading, of, both, semi, circular, and, pointed, shape, or, windows, that, are, identical, in, height, and, width, but, in, which, the, later, ones, are, pointed, this, can, be, seen, on, the, towers, of, tournai, cathedral, and, on, the, western, towers, and, fa, ade, at, ely, cathedral, other, variations, that, appear, to, hover, between, romanesque, and, gothic, occur, such, as, the, fa, ade, designed, by, abbot, suger, at, the, abbey, of, saint, denis, which, retains, much, that, is, romanesque, in, its, appearance, and, the, fa, ade, of, laon, cathedral, which, despite, its, gothic, form, has, round, arches, abbot, suger, s, innovative, choir, of, the, abbey, of, saint, denis, 1140, 44, led, to, the, adoption, of, the, gothic, style, by, paris, and, its, surrounding, area, but, other, parts, of, france, were, slower, to, take, it, up, and, provincial, churches, continued, to, be, built, in, the, heavy, manner, and, rubble, stone, of, the, romanesque, even, when, the, openings, were, treated, with, the, fashionable, pointed, arch, in, england, the, romanesque, groundplan, which, in, that, country, commonly, had, a, very, long, nave, continued, to, affect, the, style, of, building, of, cathedrals, and, those, large, abbey, churches, which, were, also, to, become, cathedrals, at, the, dissolution, of, the, monasteries, in, the, 16th, century, despite, the, fact, that, english, cathedrals, were, built, or, rebuilt, in, many, stages, substantial, areas, of, norman, building, can, be, seen, in, many, of, them, particularly, in, the, nave, arcades, in, the, case, of, winchester, cathedral, the, gothic, arches, were, literally, carved, out, of, the, existent, norman, piers, other, cathedrals, have, sections, of, their, building, which, are, clearly, an, intermediate, stage, between, norman, and, gothic, such, as, the, western, towers, of, ely, cathedral, and, part, of, the, nave, at, worcester, cathedral, the, first, truly, gothic, building, in, england, is, the, long, eastern, end, of, canterbury, cathedral, commenced, in, 1175, in, italy, although, many, churches, such, as, florence, cathedral, and, santa, maria, novella, were, built, in, the, gothic, style, or, utilising, the, pointed, arch, and, window, tracery, romanesque, features, derived, from, the, roman, architectural, heritage, such, as, sturdy, columns, with, capitals, of, a, modified, corinthian, form, continued, to, be, used, the, pointed, vault, was, utilised, where, convenient, but, it, is, commonly, interspersed, with, semicircular, arches, and, vaults, wherever, they, conveniently, fit, the, fa, ades, of, gothic, churches, in, italy, are, not, always, easily, distinguishable, from, the, romanesque, germany, was, not, quick, to, adopt, the, gothic, style, and, when, it, did, so, in, the, 1230s, the, buildings, were, often, modelled, very, directly, upon, french, cathedrals, as, cologne, cathedral, was, modelled, on, amiens, the, smaller, churches, and, abbeys, continued, to, be, constructed, in, a, more, provincial, romanesque, manner, the, date, only, being, registered, by, the, pointed, window, openings, the, romanesque, period, was, a, time, of, great, development, in, the, design, and, construction, of, defensive, architecture, after, churches, and, the, monastic, buildings, with, which, they, are, often, associated, castles, are, the, most, numerous, type, of, building, of, the, period, while, most, are, in, ruins, through, the, action, of, war, and, politics, others, like, william, the, conqueror, s, white, tower, within, the, tower, of, london, have, remained, almost, intact, in, some, regions, particularly, germany, large, palaces, were, built, for, rulers, and, bishops, local, lords, built, great, halls, in, the, countryside, while, rich, merchants, built, grand, town, houses, in, italy, city, councils, constructed, town, halls, called, broletto, or, arengario, while, wealthy, cities, of, northern, europe, protected, their, trading, interests, with, warehouses, and, commercial, premises, all, over, europe, dwellers, of, the, town, and, country, built, houses, to, live, in, some, of, which, sturdily, constructed, in, stone, have, remained, to, this, day, with, sufficient, of, their, form, and, details, intact, to, give, a, picture, of, the, style, of, domestic, architecture, that, was, in, fashion, at, the, time, examples, of, all, these, types, of, buildings, can, be, found, scattered, across, europe, sometimes, as, isolated, survivals, like, the, two, merchants, houses, on, opposite, sides, of, steep, hill, in, lincoln, england, and, sometimes, giving, form, to, a, whole, medieval, city, like, san, gimignano, in, tuscany, italy, these, buildings, are, the, subject, of, a, separate, article, see, also, romanesque, revival,
