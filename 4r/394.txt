pop, music, is, a, genre, of, popular, music, that, originated, in, its, modern, form, during, the, mid, 1950s, in, the, united, states, and, the, united, kingdom, during, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, pop, music, encompassed, rock, and, roll, and, the, youth, oriented, styles, it, influenced, rock, and, pop, music, remained, roughly, synonymous, until, the, late, 1960s, after, which, pop, became, associated, with, music, that, was, more, commercial, ephemeral, and, accessible, identifying, factors, of, pop, music, usually, include, repeated, choruses, and, hooks, short, to, medium, length, songs, written, in, a, basic, format, often, the, verse, chorus, structure, and, rhythms, or, tempos, that, can, be, easily, danced, to, much, of, pop, music, also, borrows, elements, from, other, styles, such, as, rock, urban, dance, latin, and, country, the, terms, popular, music, and, pop, music, are, often, used, interchangeably, although, the, former, more, accurately, describes, all, music, that, is, popular, and, includes, many, disparate, styles, although, much, of, the, music, that, appears, on, record, charts, is, considered, to, be, pop, music, the, genre, is, distinguished, from, chart, music, david, hatch, and, stephen, millward, describe, pop, music, as, a, body, of, music, which, is, distinguishable, from, popular, jazz, and, folk, music, according, to, pete, seeger, pop, music, is, professional, music, which, draws, upon, both, folk, music, and, fine, arts, music, david, boyle, a, music, researcher, states, pop, music, as, any, type, of, music, that, a, person, has, been, exposed, to, by, the, mass, media, most, individuals, think, that, pop, music, is, just, the, singles, charts, and, not, the, sum, of, all, chart, music, the, music, charts, contain, songs, from, a, variety, of, sources, including, classical, jazz, rock, and, novelty, songs, as, a, genre, pop, music, is, seen, to, exist, and, develop, separately, therefore, the, term, pop, music, may, be, used, to, describe, a, distinct, genre, designed, to, appeal, to, all, often, characterized, as, instant, singles, based, music, aimed, at, teenagers, in, contrast, to, rock, music, as, album, based, music, for, adults, pop, music, continuously, evolves, along, with, the, term, s, definition, according, to, music, writer, bill, lamb, popular, music, is, defined, as, the, music, since, industrialization, in, the, 1800s, that, is, most, in, line, with, the, tastes, and, interests, of, the, urban, middle, class, the, term, pop, song, was, first, used, in, 1926, in, the, sense, of, a, piece, of, music, having, popular, appeal, hatch, and, millward, indicate, that, many, events, in, the, history, of, recording, in, the, 1920s, can, be, seen, as, the, birth, of, the, modern, pop, music, industry, including, in, country, blues, and, hillbilly, music, according, to, the, website, of, the, new, grove, dictionary, of, music, and, musicians, the, term, pop, music, originated, in, britain, in, the, mid, 1950s, as, a, description, for, rock, and, roll, and, the, new, youth, music, styles, that, it, influenced, the, oxford, dictionary, of, music, states, that, while, pop, s, earlier, meaning, meant, concerts, appealing, to, a, wide, audience, since, the, late, 1950s, however, pop, has, had, the, special, meaning, of, non, classical, mus, usually, in, the, form, of, songs, performed, by, such, artists, as, the, beatles, the, rolling, stones, abba, etc, grove, music, online, also, states, that, in, the, early, 1960s, pop, music, competed, terminologically, with, beat, music, while, in, the, us, its, coverage, overlapped, as, it, still, does, with, that, of, rock, and, roll, from, about, 1967, the, term, pop, music, was, increasingly, used, in, opposition, to, the, term, rock, music, a, division, that, gave, generic, significance, to, both, terms, while, rock, aspired, to, authenticity, and, an, expansion, of, the, possibilities, of, popular, music, pop, was, more, commercial, ephemeral, and, accessible, according, to, british, musicologist, simon, frith, pop, music, is, produced, as, a, matter, of, enterprise, not, art, and, is, designed, to, appeal, to, everyone, but, doesn, t, come, from, any, particular, place, or, mark, off, any, particular, taste, frith, adds, that, it, is, not, driven, by, any, significant, ambition, except, profit, and, commercial, reward, and, in, musical, terms, it, is, essentially, conservative, it, is, provided, from, on, high, by, record, companies, radio, programmers, and, concert, promoters, rather, than, being, made, from, below, pop, is, not, a, do, it, yourself, music, but, is, professionally, produced, and, packaged, according, to, frith, characteristics, of, pop, music, include, an, aim, of, appealing, to, a, general, audience, rather, than, to, a, particular, sub, culture, or, ideology, and, an, emphasis, on, craftsmanship, rather, than, formal, artistic, qualities, besides, frith, also, offers, three, identifying, characteristics, of, pop, music, light, entertainment, commercial, imperatives, and, personal, identification, pop, music, grew, out, of, a, light, entertainment, and, easy, listening, tradition, pop, music, is, more, conservative, than, other, music, genres, such, as, folk, blues, country, and, tradition, many, pop, songs, do, not, contain, themes, of, resistance, opposition, or, political, themes, rather, focusing, more, on, love, and, relationships, therefore, pop, music, does, not, challenge, its, audiences, socially, and, does, not, cause, political, activism, frith, also, said, the, main, purpose, of, pop, music, is, to, create, revenue, it, is, not, a, medium, of, free, articulation, of, the, people, instead, pop, music, seeks, to, supply, the, nature, of, personal, desire, and, achieve, the, instant, empathy, with, cliche, personalities, stereotypes, and, melodrama, that, appeals, to, listeners, it, is, mostly, about, how, much, revenue, pop, music, makes, for, record, companies, music, scholar, timothy, warner, said, pop, music, typically, has, an, emphasis, on, recording, production, and, technology, rather, than, live, performance, a, tendency, to, reflect, existing, trends, rather, than, progressive, developments, and, seeks, to, encourage, dancing, or, uses, dance, oriented, rhythms, the, main, medium, of, pop, music, is, the, song, often, between, two, and, a, half, and, three, and, a, half, minutes, in, length, generally, marked, by, a, consistent, and, noticeable, rhythmic, element, a, mainstream, style, and, a, simple, traditional, structure, the, structure, of, many, popular, songs, is, that, of, a, verse, and, a, chorus, the, chorus, serving, as, the, portion, of, the, track, that, is, designed, to, stick, in, the, ear, through, simple, repetition, both, musically, and, lyrically, the, chorus, is, often, where, the, music, builds, towards, and, is, often, preceded, by, the, drop, where, the, bass, and, drum, parts, drop, out, common, variants, include, the, verse, chorus, form, and, the, thirty, two, bar, form, with, a, focus, on, melodies, and, catchy, hooks, and, a, chorus, that, contrasts, melodically, rhythmically, and, harmonically, with, the, verse, the, beat, and, the, melodies, tend, to, be, simple, with, limited, harmonic, accompaniment, the, lyrics, of, modern, pop, songs, typically, focus, on, simple, themes, often, love, and, romantic, relationships, although, there, are, notable, exceptions, harmony, and, chord, progressions, in, pop, music, are, often, that, of, classical, european, tonality, only, more, simple, minded, clich, s, include, the, barbershop, quartet, style, harmony, i, e, ii, v, i, and, blues, scale, influenced, harmony, there, was, a, lessening, of, the, influence, of, traditional, views, of, the, circle, of, fifths, between, the, mid, 1950s, and, the, late, 1970s, including, less, predominance, for, the, dominant, function, in, october, 2023, billboard, compiled, a, list, of, the, 500, best, pop, songs, in, doing, so, they, noted, the, difficulty, of, defining, pop, songs, one, of, the, reasons, pop, can, be, hard, to, summarize, is, because, there, s, no, real, sonic, or, musical, definition, to, it, there, are, common, elements, to, a, lot, of, the, biggest, pop, songs, but, at, the, end, of, the, day, pop, means, popular, first, and, foremost, and, just, about, any, song, that, becomes, popular, enough, can, be, considered, a, pop, song, in, the, 1940s, improved, microphone, design, allowed, a, more, intimate, singing, style, and, ten, or, twenty, years, later, inexpensive, and, more, durable, 45, rpm, records, for, singles, revolutionized, the, manner, in, which, pop, has, been, disseminated, which, helped, to, move, pop, music, to, a, record, radio, film, star, system, another, technological, change, was, the, widespread, availability, of, television, in, the, 1950s, with, televised, performances, which, meant, that, pop, stars, had, to, have, a, visual, presence, in, the, 1960s, the, introduction, of, inexpensive, portable, transistor, radios, meant, that, teenagers, in, the, developed, world, could, listen, to, music, outside, of, the, home, by, the, early, 1980s, the, promotion, of, pop, music, had, been, greatly, affected, by, the, rise, of, music, television, channels, like, mtv, which, favoured, those, artists, such, as, michael, jackson, and, madonna, who, had, a, strong, visual, appeal, multi, track, recording, from, the, 1960s, and, digital, sampling, from, the, 1980s, have, also, been, used, as, methods, for, the, creation, and, elaboration, of, pop, music, during, the, mid, 1960s, pop, music, made, repeated, forays, into, new, sounds, styles, and, techniques, that, inspired, public, discourse, among, its, listeners, the, word, progressive, was, frequently, used, and, it, was, thought, that, every, song, and, single, was, to, be, a, progression, from, the, last, music, critic, simon, reynolds, writes, that, beginning, with, 1967, a, divide, would, exist, between, progressive, pop, and, mass, chart, pop, a, separation, which, was, also, broadly, one, between, boys, and, girls, middle, class, and, working, class, the, latter, half, of, the, 20th, century, included, a, large, scale, trend, in, american, culture, in, which, the, boundaries, between, art, and, pop, music, were, increasingly, blurred, between, 1950, and, 1970, there, was, a, debate, of, pop, versus, art, since, then, certain, music, publications, have, embraced, the, music, s, legitimacy, a, trend, referred, to, as, poptimism, throughout, its, development, pop, music, has, absorbed, influences, from, other, genres, of, popular, music, early, pop, music, drew, on, traditional, pop, an, american, counterpart, to, german, schlager, and, french, chanson, however, compared, to, the, pop, of, european, countries, traditional, pop, originally, emphasized, influences, ranging, from, tin, pan, alley, songwriting, broadway, theatre, and, show, tunes, as, the, genre, evolved, more, influences, ranging, from, classical, folk, rock, country, electronic, music, and, other, popular, genres, became, more, prominent, in, 2016, a, scientific, reports, study, that, examined, over, 464, 000, recordings, of, popular, music, recorded, between, 1955, and, 2010, found, that, compared, to, 1960s, pop, music, contemporary, pop, music, uses, a, smaller, variety, of, pitch, progressions, greater, average, volume, less, diverse, instrumentation, and, recording, techniques, and, less, timbral, variety, scientific, american, s, john, matson, reported, that, this, seems, to, support, the, popular, anecdotal, observation, that, pop, music, of, yore, was, better, or, at, least, more, varied, than, today, s, top, 40, stuff, however, he, also, noted, that, the, study, may, not, have, been, entirely, representative, of, pop, in, each, generation, in, the, 1960s, the, majority, of, mainstream, pop, music, fell, in, two, categories, guitar, drum, and, bass, groups, or, singers, backed, by, a, traditional, orchestra, since, early, in, the, decade, it, was, common, for, pop, producers, songwriters, and, engineers, to, freely, experiment, with, musical, form, orchestration, unnatural, reverb, and, other, sound, effects, some, of, the, best, known, examples, are, phil, spector, s, wall, of, sound, and, joe, meek, s, use, of, homemade, electronic, sound, effects, for, acts, like, the, tornados, at, the, same, time, pop, music, on, radio, and, in, both, american, and, british, film, moved, away, from, refined, tin, pan, alley, to, more, eccentric, songwriting, and, incorporated, reverb, drenched, electric, guitar, symphonic, strings, and, horns, played, by, groups, of, properly, arranged, and, rehearsed, studio, musicians, a, 2019, study, held, by, new, york, university, in, which, 643, participants, had, to, rank, how, familiar, a, pop, song, is, to, them, songs, from, the, 1960s, turned, out, to, be, the, most, memorable, significantly, more, than, songs, from, recent, years, 2000, to, 2015, before, the, progressive, pop, of, the, late, 1960s, performers, were, typically, unable, to, decide, on, the, artistic, content, of, their, music, assisted, by, the, mid, 1960s, economic, boom, record, labels, began, investing, in, artists, giving, them, the, freedom, to, experiment, and, offering, them, limited, control, over, their, content, and, marketing, this, situation, declined, after, the, late, 1970s, and, would, not, reemerge, until, the, rise, of, internet, stars, indie, pop, which, developed, in, the, late, 1970s, marked, another, departure, from, the, glamour, of, contemporary, pop, music, with, guitar, bands, formed, on, the, then, novel, premise, that, one, could, record, and, release, their, own, music, without, having, to, procure, a, record, contract, from, a, major, label, the, 1980s, are, commonly, remembered, for, an, increase, in, the, use, of, digital, recording, associated, with, the, usage, of, synthesizers, with, synth, pop, music, and, other, electronic, genres, featuring, non, traditional, instruments, increasing, in, popularity, by, 2014, pop, music, worldwide, had, been, permeated, by, electronic, dance, music, in, 2018, researchers, at, the, university, of, california, irvine, concluded, that, pop, music, has, become, sadder, since, the, 1980s, the, elements, of, happiness, and, brightness, have, eventually, been, replaced, with, electronic, beats, making, pop, music, more, sad, yet, danceable, pop, music, has, been, dominated, by, the, american, and, from, the, mid, 1960s, british, music, industries, whose, influence, has, made, pop, music, something, of, an, international, monoculture, but, most, regions, and, countries, have, their, own, form, of, pop, music, sometimes, producing, local, versions, of, wider, trends, and, lending, them, local, characteristics, some, of, these, trends, for, example, europop, have, had, a, significant, impact, on, the, development, of, the, genre, the, story, of, pop, music, is, largely, the, story, of, the, intertwining, pop, culture, of, the, united, states, and, the, united, kingdom, in, the, postwar, era, bob, stanley, according, to, grove, music, online, western, derived, pop, styles, whether, coexisting, with, or, marginalizing, distinctively, local, genres, have, spread, throughout, the, world, and, have, come, to, constitute, stylistic, common, denominators, in, global, commercial, music, cultures, some, non, western, countries, such, as, japan, have, developed, a, thriving, pop, music, industry, most, of, which, is, devoted, to, western, style, pop, japan, has, for, several, years, produced, a, greater, quantity, of, music, than, everywhere, except, the, us, the, spread, of, western, style, pop, music, has, been, interpreted, variously, as, representing, processes, of, americanization, homogenization, modernization, creative, appropriation, cultural, imperialism, or, a, more, general, process, of, globalization, one, of, the, pop, music, styles, that, developed, alongside, other, music, styles, is, latin, pop, which, rose, in, popularity, in, the, us, during, the, 1950s, with, early, rock, and, roll, success, ritchie, valens, later, los, lobos, and, chicano, rock, gained, in, popularity, during, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, and, musician, selena, saw, large, scale, popularity, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, along, with, crossover, appeal, with, fans, of, tejano, musicians, lydia, mendoza, and, little, joe, with, later, hispanic, and, latino, americans, seeing, success, within, pop, music, charts, 1990s, pop, successes, stayed, popular, in, both, their, original, genres, and, in, broader, pop, music, latin, pop, hit, singles, such, as, macarena, by, los, del, r, o, and, despacito, by, luis, fonsi, have, seen, record, breaking, success, on, worldwide, pop, music, charts, notable, pop, artists, of, the, late, 20th, century, that, became, global, superstars, include, whitney, houston, michael, jackson, madonna, george, michael, and, prince, at, the, beginning, of, the, 2000s, the, trends, that, dominated, during, the, late, 1990s, still, continued, but, the, music, industry, started, to, change, as, people, began, to, download, music, from, the, internet, people, were, able, to, discover, genres, and, artists, that, were, outside, of, the, mainstream, and, propel, them, to, fame, but, at, the, same, time, smaller, artists, had, a, harder, time, making, a, living, because, their, music, was, being, pirated, popular, artists, were, avril, lavigne, justin, timberlake, nsync, christina, aguilera, destiny, s, child, and, britney, spears, pop, music, often, came, from, many, different, genres, with, each, genre, in, turn, influencing, the, next, one, blurring, the, lines, between, them, and, making, them, less, distinct, this, change, was, epitomized, in, spears, highly, influential, 2007, album, blackout, which, under, the, influence, of, producer, danja, mixed, the, sounds, of, edm, avant, funk, r, b, dance, music, and, hip, hop, by, 2010, pop, music, impacted, by, dance, music, came, to, be, dominant, on, the, charts, instead, of, radio, setting, the, trends, it, was, now, the, club, at, the, beginning, of, the, 2010s, will, i, am, stated, the, new, bubble, is, all, the, collective, clubs, around, the, world, radio, is, just, doing, its, best, to, keep, up, songs, that, talked, of, escapism, through, partying, became, the, most, popular, influenced, by, the, impulse, to, forget, the, economic, troubles, that, had, taken, over, the, world, after, the, 2008, crash, throughout, the, 2010s, a, lot, of, pop, music, also, began, to, take, cues, from, alternative, pop, popularized, by, artists, such, as, lana, del, rey, and, lorde, in, the, early, 2010s, and, later, inspiring, other, highly, influential, artists, including, billie, eilish, and, taylor, swift, it, gave, space, to, a, more, sad, and, moody, tone, within, pop, music
