classicism, in, the, arts, refers, generally, to, a, high, regard, for, a, classical, period, classical, antiquity, in, the, western, tradition, as, setting, standards, for, taste, which, the, classicists, seek, to, emulate, in, its, purest, form, classicism, is, an, aesthetic, attitude, dependent, on, principles, based, in, the, culture, art, and, literature, of, ancient, greece, and, rome, with, the, emphasis, on, form, simplicity, proportion, clarity, of, structure, perfection, and, restrained, emotion, as, well, as, explicit, appeal, to, the, intellect, the, art, of, classicism, typically, seeks, to, be, formal, and, restrained, of, the, discobolus, sir, kenneth, clark, observed, if, we, object, to, his, restraint, and, compression, we, are, simply, objecting, to, the, classicism, of, classic, art, a, violent, emphasis, or, a, sudden, acceleration, of, rhythmic, movement, would, have, destroyed, those, qualities, of, balance, and, completeness, through, which, it, retained, until, the, present, century, its, position, of, authority, in, the, restricted, repertoire, of, visual, images, classicism, as, clark, noted, implies, a, canon, of, widely, accepted, ideal, forms, whether, in, the, western, canon, that, he, was, examining, in, the, nude, 1956, classicism, is, a, force, which, is, often, present, in, post, medieval, european, and, european, influenced, traditions, however, some, periods, felt, themselves, more, connected, to, the, classical, ideals, than, others, particularly, the, age, of, enlightenment, when, neoclassicism, was, an, important, movement, in, the, visual, arts, classicism, is, a, specific, genre, of, philosophy, expressing, itself, in, literature, architecture, art, and, music, which, has, ancient, greek, and, roman, sources, and, an, emphasis, on, society, it, was, particularly, expressed, in, the, neoclassicism, of, the, age, of, enlightenment, classicism, is, a, recurrent, tendency, in, the, late, antique, period, and, had, a, major, revival, in, carolingian, and, ottonian, art, there, was, another, more, durable, revival, in, the, italian, renaissance, when, the, fall, of, byzantium, and, rising, trade, with, the, islamic, cultures, brought, a, flood, of, knowledge, about, and, from, the, antiquity, of, europe, until, that, time, the, identification, with, antiquity, had, been, seen, as, a, continuous, history, of, christendom, from, the, conversion, of, roman, emperor, constantine, i, renaissance, classicism, introduced, a, host, of, elements, into, european, culture, including, the, application, of, mathematics, and, empiricism, into, art, humanism, literary, and, depictive, realism, and, formalism, importantly, it, also, introduced, polytheism, or, paganism, and, the, juxtaposition, of, ancient, and, modern, the, classicism, of, the, renaissance, led, to, and, gave, way, to, a, different, sense, of, what, was, classical, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, in, this, period, classicism, took, on, more, overtly, structural, overtones, of, orderliness, predictability, the, use, of, geometry, and, grids, the, importance, of, rigorous, discipline, and, pedagogy, as, well, as, the, formation, of, schools, of, art, and, music, the, court, of, louis, xiv, was, seen, as, the, center, of, this, form, of, classicism, with, its, references, to, the, gods, of, olympus, as, a, symbolic, prop, for, absolutism, its, adherence, to, axiomatic, and, deductive, reasoning, and, its, love, of, order, and, predictability, this, period, sought, the, revival, of, classical, art, forms, including, greek, drama, and, music, opera, in, its, modern, european, form, had, its, roots, in, attempts, to, recreate, the, combination, of, singing, and, dancing, with, theatre, thought, to, be, the, greek, norm, examples, of, this, appeal, to, classicism, included, dante, petrarch, and, shakespeare, in, poetry, and, theatre, tudor, drama, in, particular, modeled, itself, after, classical, ideals, and, divided, works, into, tragedy, and, comedy, studying, ancient, greek, became, regarded, as, essential, for, a, well, rounded, education, in, the, liberal, arts, the, renaissance, also, explicitly, returned, to, architectural, models, and, techniques, associated, with, greek, and, roman, antiquity, including, the, golden, rectangle, as, a, key, proportion, for, buildings, the, classical, orders, of, columns, as, well, as, a, host, of, ornament, and, detail, associated, with, greek, and, roman, architecture, they, also, began, reviving, plastic, arts, such, as, bronze, casting, for, sculpture, and, used, the, classical, naturalism, as, the, foundation, of, drawing, painting, and, sculpture, the, age, of, enlightenment, identified, itself, with, a, vision, of, antiquity, which, while, continuous, with, the, classicism, of, the, previous, century, was, shaken, by, the, physics, of, sir, isaac, newton, the, improvements, in, machinery, and, measurement, and, a, sense, of, liberation, which, they, saw, as, being, present, in, the, greek, civilization, particularly, in, its, struggles, against, the, persian, empire, the, ornate, organic, and, complexly, integrated, forms, of, the, baroque, were, to, give, way, to, a, series, of, movements, that, regarded, themselves, expressly, as, classical, or, neo, classical, or, would, rapidly, be, labelled, as, such, for, example, the, painting, of, jacques, louis, david, was, seen, as, an, attempt, to, return, to, formal, balance, clarity, manliness, and, vigor, in, art, the, 19th, century, saw, the, classical, age, as, being, the, precursor, of, academicism, including, such, movements, as, uniformitarianism, in, the, sciences, and, the, creation, of, rigorous, categories, in, artistic, fields, various, movements, of, the, romantic, period, saw, themselves, as, classical, revolts, against, a, prevailing, trend, of, emotionalism, and, irregularity, for, example, the, pre, raphaelites, by, this, point, classicism, was, old, enough, that, previous, classical, movements, received, revivals, for, example, the, renaissance, was, seen, as, a, means, to, combine, the, organic, medieval, with, the, orderly, classical, the, 19th, century, continued, or, extended, many, classical, programs, in, the, sciences, most, notably, the, newtonian, program, to, account, for, the, movement, of, energy, between, bodies, by, means, of, exchange, of, mechanical, and, thermal, energy, the, 20th, century, saw, a, number, of, changes, in, the, arts, and, sciences, classicism, was, used, both, by, those, who, rejected, or, saw, as, temporary, transfigurations, in, the, political, scientific, and, social, world, and, by, those, who, embraced, the, changes, as, a, means, to, overthrow, the, perceived, weight, of, the, 19th, century, thus, both, pre, 20th, century, disciplines, were, labelled, classical, and, modern, movements, in, art, which, saw, themselves, as, aligned, with, light, space, sparseness, of, texture, and, formal, coherence, in, the, present, day, philosophy, classicism, is, used, as, a, term, particularly, in, relation, to, apollonian, over, dionysian, impulses, in, society, and, art, that, is, a, preference, for, rationality, or, at, least, rationally, guided, catharsis, over, emotionalism, classicism, in, the, theatre, was, developed, by, 17th, century, french, playwrights, from, what, they, judged, to, be, the, rules, of, greek, classical, theatre, including, the, classical, unities, of, time, place, and, action, found, in, the, poetics, of, aristotle, examples, of, classicist, playwrights, are, pierre, corneille, jean, racine, and, moli, re, in, the, period, of, romanticism, shakespeare, who, conformed, to, none, of, the, classical, rules, became, the, focus, of, french, argument, over, them, in, which, the, romantics, eventually, triumphed, victor, hugo, was, among, the, first, french, playwrights, to, break, these, conventions, the, influence, of, these, french, rules, on, playwrights, in, other, nations, is, debatable, in, the, english, theatre, restoration, playwrights, such, as, william, wycherley, and, william, congreve, would, have, been, familiar, with, them, william, shakespeare, and, his, contemporaries, did, not, follow, this, classicist, philosophy, in, particular, since, they, were, not, french, and, also, because, they, wrote, several, decades, prior, to, their, establishment, those, of, shakespeare, s, plays, that, seem, to, display, the, unities, such, as, the, tempest, probably, indicate, a, familiarity, with, actual, models, from, classical, antiquity, most, famous, 18th, century, italian, playwright, and, libretist, carlo, goldoni, created, a, hybrid, style, of, playwriting, combining, the, model, of, moli, re, with, the, strengths, of, commedia, dell, arte, and, his, own, wit, and, sincerity, the, literary, classicism, drew, inspiration, from, the, qualities, of, proportion, of, the, major, works, of, ancient, greek, and, latin, literature, the, 17th, 18th, centuries, significant, classical, writers, principally, playwrights, and, poets, include, pierre, corneille, jean, racine, john, dryden, william, wycherley, william, congreve, jonathan, swift, joseph, addison, alexander, pope, voltaire, carlo, goldoni, and, friedrich, gottlieb, klopstock, classicism, in, architecture, developed, during, the, italian, renaissance, notably, in, the, writings, and, designs, of, leon, battista, alberti, and, the, work, of, filippo, brunelleschi, it, places, emphasis, on, symmetry, proportion, geometry, and, the, regularity, of, parts, as, they, are, demonstrated, in, the, architecture, of, classical, antiquity, and, in, particular, the, architecture, of, ancient, rome, of, which, many, examples, remained, orderly, arrangements, of, columns, pilasters, and, lintels, as, well, as, the, use, of, semicircular, arches, hemispherical, domes, niches, and, aedicules, replaced, the, more, complex, proportional, systems, and, irregular, profiles, of, medieval, buildings, this, style, quickly, spread, to, other, italian, cities, and, then, to, france, germany, england, russia, and, elsewhere, in, the, 16th, century, sebastiano, serlio, helped, codify, the, classical, orders, and, andrea, palladio, s, legacy, evolved, into, the, long, tradition, of, palladian, architecture, building, off, of, these, influences, the, 17th, century, architects, inigo, jones, and, christopher, wren, firmly, established, classicism, in, england, for, the, development, of, classicism, from, the, mid, 18th, century, onwards, see, neoclassical, architecture, italian, renaissance, painting, and, sculpture, are, marked, by, their, renewal, of, classical, forms, motifs, and, subjects, in, the, 15th, century, leon, battista, alberti, was, important, in, theorizing, many, of, the, ideas, for, painting, that, came, to, a, fully, realized, product, with, raphael, s, school, of, athens, during, the, high, renaissance, the, themes, continued, largely, unbroken, into, the, 17th, century, when, artists, such, as, nicolas, poussin, and, charles, le, brun, represented, of, the, more, rigid, classicism, like, italian, classicizing, ideas, in, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, it, spread, through, europe, in, the, mid, to, late, 17th, century, later, classicism, in, painting, and, sculpture, from, the, mid, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, is, generally, referred, to, as, neoclassicism, classicism, in, political, philosophy, dates, back, to, the, ancient, greeks, western, political, philosophy, is, often, attributed, to, the, great, greek, philosopher, plato, although, political, theory, of, this, time, starts, with, plato, it, quickly, becomes, complex, when, plato, s, pupil, aristotle, formulates, his, own, ideas, the, political, theories, of, both, philosophers, are, closely, tied, to, their, ethical, theories, and, their, interest, is, in, questions, concerning, constitutions, or, forms, of, government, however, plato, and, aristotle, are, not, the, seedbed, but, simply, the, seeds, that, grew, from, a, seedbed, of, political, predecessors, who, had, debated, this, topic, for, centuries, before, their, time, for, example, herodotus, sketched, out, a, debate, between, theseus, a, king, of, the, time, and, creon, s, messenger, the, debate, simply, shows, proponents, of, democracy, monarchy, and, oligarchy, and, how, they, all, feel, about, these, forms, of, government, herodotus, sketch, is, just, one, of, the, beginning, seedbeds, for, which, plato, and, aristotle, grew, their, own, political, theories, another, greek, philosopher, who, was, pivotal, in, the, development, of, classical, political, philosophy, was, socrates, although, he, was, not, a, theory, builder, he, often, stimulated, fellow, citizens, with, paradoxes, that, challenged, them, to, reflect, on, their, own, beliefs, socrates, thought, the, values, that, ought, to, determine, how, individuals, live, their, lives, should, also, shape, the, political, life, of, the, community, he, believed, the, people, of, athens, involved, wealth, and, money, too, much, into, the, politics, of, their, city, he, judged, the, citizens, for, the, way, they, amassed, wealth, and, power, over, simple, things, like, projects, for, their, community, just, like, plato, and, aristotle, socrates, did, not, come, up, with, these, ideas, alone, socrates, ideals, stem, back, from, protagoras, and, other, sophists, these, teachers, of, political, arts, were, the, first, to, think, and, act, as, socrates, did, where, the, two, diverge, is, in, the, way, they, practiced, their, ideals, protagoras, ideals, were, loved, by, athens, whereas, socrates, challenged, and, pushed, the, citizens, and, he, was, not, as, loved, in, the, end, ancient, greece, is, to, be, credited, with, the, foundation, of, classical, political, philosophy
