a, percussion, instrument, is, a, musical, instrument, that, is, sounded, by, being, struck, or, scraped, by, a, beater, including, attached, or, enclosed, beaters, or, rattles, struck, scraped, or, rubbed, by, hand, or, struck, against, another, similar, instrument, excluding, zoomusicological, instruments, and, the, human, voice, the, percussion, family, is, believed, to, include, the, oldest, musical, instruments, in, spite, of, being, a, very, common, term, to, designate, instruments, and, to, relate, them, to, their, players, the, percussionists, percussion, is, not, a, systematic, classificatory, category, of, instruments, as, described, by, the, scientific, field, of, organology, it, is, shown, below, that, percussion, instruments, may, belong, to, the, organological, classes, of, idiophone, membranophone, aerophone, and, chordophone, the, percussion, section, of, an, orchestra, most, commonly, contains, instruments, such, as, the, timpani, snare, drum, bass, drum, tambourine, belonging, to, the, membranophones, and, cymbals, and, triangle, which, are, idiophones, however, the, section, can, also, contain, aerophones, such, as, whistles, and, sirens, or, a, blown, conch, shell, percussive, techniques, can, even, be, applied, to, the, human, body, itself, as, in, body, percussion, on, the, other, hand, keyboard, instruments, such, as, the, celesta, are, not, normally, part, of, the, percussion, section, but, keyboard, percussion, instruments, such, as, the, glockenspiel, and, xylophone, which, do, not, have, piano, keyboards, are, included, percussion, instruments, are, most, commonly, divided, into, two, classes, pitched, percussion, instruments, which, produce, notes, with, an, identifiable, pitch, and, unpitched, percussion, instruments, which, produce, notes, or, sounds, in, an, indefinite, pitch, percussion, instruments, may, play, not, only, rhythm, but, also, melody, and, harmony, percussion, is, commonly, referred, to, as, the, backbone, or, the, heartbeat, of, a, musical, ensemble, often, working, in, close, collaboration, with, bass, instruments, when, present, in, jazz, and, other, popular, music, ensembles, the, pianist, bassist, drummer, and, sometimes, the, guitarist, are, referred, to, as, the, rhythm, section, most, classical, pieces, written, for, full, orchestra, since, the, time, of, haydn, and, mozart, are, orchestrated, to, place, emphasis, on, the, strings, woodwinds, and, brass, however, often, at, least, one, pair, of, timpani, is, included, though, they, rarely, play, continuously, rather, they, serve, to, provide, additional, accents, when, needed, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, other, percussion, instruments, like, the, triangle, or, cymbals, have, been, used, again, generally, sparingly, the, use, of, percussion, instruments, became, more, frequent, in, the, 20th, century, classical, music, in, almost, every, style, of, music, percussion, plays, a, pivotal, role, in, military, marching, bands, and, pipes, and, drums, it, is, the, beat, of, the, bass, drum, that, keeps, the, soldiers, in, step, and, at, a, regular, speed, and, it, is, the, snare, that, provides, that, crisp, decisive, air, to, the, tune, of, a, regiment, in, classic, jazz, one, almost, immediately, thinks, of, the, distinctive, rhythm, of, the, hi, hats, or, the, ride, cymbal, when, the, word, swing, is, spoken, in, more, recent, popular, music, culture, it, is, almost, impossible, to, name, three, or, four, rock, hip, hop, rap, funk, or, even, soul, charts, or, songs, that, do, not, have, some, sort, of, percussive, beat, keeping, the, tune, in, time, because, of, the, diversity, of, percussive, instruments, it, is, not, uncommon, to, find, large, musical, ensembles, composed, entirely, of, percussion, rhythm, melody, and, harmony, are, all, represented, in, these, ensembles, music, for, pitched, percussion, instruments, can, be, notated, on, a, staff, with, the, same, treble, and, bass, clefs, used, by, many, non, percussive, instruments, music, for, percussive, instruments, without, a, definite, pitch, can, be, notated, with, a, specialist, rhythm, or, percussion, clef, the, guitar, also, has, a, special, tab, staff, more, often, a, bass, clef, is, substituted, for, rhythm, clef, based, on, the, previous, reservation, percussion, instruments, are, classified, by, various, criteria, sometimes, depending, on, their, construction, ethnic, origin, function, within, musical, theory, and, orchestration, or, their, relative, prevalence, in, common, knowledge, the, word, percussion, derives, from, the, latin, verb, percussio, to, beat, strike, in, the, musical, sense, and, the, noun, percussus, a, beating, as, a, noun, in, contemporary, english, wiktionary, describes, it, as, the, collision, of, two, bodies, to, produce, a, sound, the, term, is, not, unique, to, music, but, has, application, in, medicine, and, weaponry, as, in, percussion, cap, however, all, known, uses, of, percussion, appear, to, share, a, similar, lineage, beginning, with, the, original, latin, percussus, in, a, musical, context, then, the, percussion, instruments, may, have, been, originally, coined, to, describe, a, family, of, musical, instruments, including, drums, rattles, metal, plates, or, blocks, that, musicians, beat, or, struck, to, produce, sound, the, hornbostel, sachs, system, has, no, high, level, section, for, percussion, most, percussion, instruments, as, the, term, is, normally, understood, are, classified, as, idiophones, and, membranophones, however, the, term, percussion, is, instead, used, at, lower, levels, of, the, hornbostel, sachs, hierarchy, including, to, identify, instruments, struck, with, either, a, non, sonorous, object, hand, stick, striker, or, against, a, non, sonorous, object, human, body, the, ground, this, is, opposed, to, concussion, which, refers, to, instruments, with, two, or, more, complementary, sonorous, parts, that, strike, against, each, other, and, other, meanings, for, example, 111, 1, concussion, idiophones, or, clappers, played, in, pairs, and, beaten, against, each, other, such, as, zills, and, clapsticks, 111, 2, percussion, idiophones, includes, many, percussion, instruments, played, with, the, hand, or, by, a, percussion, mallet, such, as, the, hang, gongs, and, the, xylophone, but, not, drums, and, only, some, cymbals, 21, struck, drums, includes, most, types, of, drum, such, as, the, timpani, snare, drum, and, tom, tom, 412, 12, percussion, reeds, a, class, of, wind, instrument, unrelated, to, percussion, in, the, more, common, sense, there, are, many, instruments, that, have, some, claim, to, being, percussion, but, are, classified, otherwise, percussion, instruments, are, sometimes, classified, as, pitched, or, unpitched, while, valid, this, classification, is, widely, seen, as, inadequate, rather, it, may, be, more, informative, to, describe, percussion, instruments, in, regards, to, one, or, more, of, the, following, four, paradigms, many, texts, including, teaching, percussion, by, gary, cook, of, the, university, of, arizona, begin, by, studying, the, physical, characteristics, of, instruments, and, the, methods, by, which, they, can, produce, sound, this, is, perhaps, the, most, scientifically, pleasing, assignment, of, nomenclature, whereas, the, other, paradigms, are, more, dependent, on, historical, or, social, circumstances, based, on, observation, and, experimentation, one, can, determine, how, an, instrument, produces, sound, and, then, assign, the, instrument, to, one, of, the, following, four, categories, idiophones, produce, sounds, through, the, vibration, of, their, entire, body, examples, of, idiophones, most, objects, commonly, known, as, drums, are, membranophones, membranophones, produce, sound, when, the, membrane, or, head, is, struck, with, a, hand, mallet, stick, beater, or, improvised, tool, examples, of, membranophones, most, instruments, known, as, chordophones, are, defined, as, string, instruments, wherein, their, sound, is, derived, from, the, vibration, of, a, string, but, some, such, as, these, examples, also, fall, under, percussion, instruments, most, instruments, known, as, aerophones, are, defined, as, wind, instruments, whereby, sound, is, produced, by, a, stream, of, air, being, blown, through, the, object, however, plosive, aerophones, such, as, the, udu, are, percussion, instruments, and, may, also, overlap, with, the, idiophone, family, in, certain, situations, such, as, in, an, orchestra, or, wind, ensemble, wind, instruments, such, as, the, acme, siren, or, various, whistles, are, played, by, percussionists, owing, to, their, unconventional, and, simple, nature, when, classifying, instruments, by, function, it, is, useful, to, note, if, a, percussion, instrument, makes, a, definite, pitch, or, indefinite, pitch, for, example, some, percussion, instruments, such, as, the, marimba, and, timpani, produce, an, obvious, fundamental, pitch, and, can, therefore, play, melody, and, serve, harmonic, functions, in, music, other, instruments, such, as, crash, cymbals, and, snare, drums, produce, sounds, with, such, complex, overtones, and, a, wide, range, of, prominent, frequencies, that, no, pitch, is, discernible, percussion, instruments, in, this, group, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, pitched, or, tuned, examples, of, percussion, instruments, with, definite, pitch, instruments, in, this, group, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, non, pitched, unpitched, or, untuned, traditionally, these, instruments, are, thought, of, as, making, a, sound, that, contains, such, complex, frequencies, that, no, discernible, pitch, can, be, heard, in, fact, many, traditionally, unpitched, instruments, such, as, triangles, and, even, cymbals, have, also, been, produced, as, tuned, sets, examples, of, percussion, instruments, with, indefinite, pitch, it, is, difficult, to, define, what, is, common, knowledge, but, there, are, instruments, percussionists, and, composers, use, in, contemporary, music, that, most, people, would, not, consider, musical, instruments, it, is, worthwhile, to, try, to, distinguish, between, instruments, based, on, their, acceptance, or, consideration, by, a, general, audience, for, example, most, people, would, not, consider, an, anvil, a, brake, drum, on, a, vehicle, with, drum, brakes, the, circular, hub, the, brake, shoes, press, against, or, a, fifty, five, gallon, oil, barrel, musical, instruments, yet, composers, and, percussionists, use, these, objects, percussion, instruments, generally, fall, into, the, following, categories, one, pre, 20th, century, example, of, found, percussion, is, the, use, of, cannon, usually, loaded, with, blank, charges, in, tchaikovsky, s, 1812, overture, john, cage, harry, partch, edgard, var, se, and, peter, schickele, all, noted, composers, created, entire, pieces, of, music, using, unconventional, instruments, beginning, in, the, early, 20th, century, perhaps, with, ionisation, by, edgard, var, se, which, used, air, raid, sirens, among, other, things, composers, began, to, require, that, percussionists, invent, or, find, objects, to, produce, desired, sounds, and, textures, another, example, the, use, of, a, hammer, and, saw, in, penderecki, s, de, natura, sonoris, no, 2, by, the, late, 20th, century, such, instruments, were, common, in, modern, percussion, ensemble, music, and, popular, productions, such, as, the, off, broadway, show, stomp, rock, band, aerosmith, used, a, number, of, unconventional, instruments, in, their, song, sweet, emotion, including, shotguns, brooms, and, a, sugar, bag, the, metal, band, slipknot, is, well, known, for, playing, unusual, percussion, items, having, two, percussionists, in, the, band, along, with, deep, sounding, drums, their, sound, includes, hitting, baseball, bats, and, other, objects, on, beer, kegs, to, create, a, distinctive, sound, it, is, not, uncommon, to, discuss, percussion, instruments, in, relation, to, their, cultural, origin, this, led, to, a, division, between, instruments, considered, common, or, modern, and, folk, instruments, with, significant, history, or, purpose, within, a, geographic, region, or, culture, this, category, includes, instruments, that, are, widely, available, and, popular, throughout, the, world, the, percussionist, uses, various, objects, to, strike, a, percussion, instrument, to, produce, sound, the, general, term, for, a, musician, who, plays, percussion, instruments, is, percussionist, but, the, terms, listed, below, often, describe, specialties, within, rock, music, the, term, percussionist, is, often, used, to, refer, to, someone, who, plays, percussion, instruments, but, is, not, primarily, a, drummer, the, term, is, especially, found, in, bands, where, one, person, plays, drums, and, another, plays, other, hit, instruments
