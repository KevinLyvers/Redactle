the, odyssey, d, s, i, ancient, greek, romanized, od, sseia, is, one, of, two, major, ancient, greek, epic, poems, attributed, to, homer, it, is, one, of, the, oldest, extant, works, of, literature, still, widely, read, by, modern, audiences, as, with, the, iliad, the, poem, is, divided, into, 24, books, it, follows, the, greek, hero, odysseus, king, of, ithaca, and, his, journey, home, after, the, trojan, war, after, the, war, which, lasted, ten, years, his, journey, from, troy, to, ithaca, via, africa, and, southern, europe, lasted, for, ten, additional, years, during, which, time, he, encountered, many, perils, and, all, of, his, crewmates, were, killed, in, his, absence, odysseus, was, assumed, dead, and, his, wife, penelope, and, son, telemachus, had, to, contend, with, a, group, of, unruly, suitors, who, were, competing, for, penelope, s, hand, in, marriage, the, odyssey, was, originally, composed, in, homeric, greek, in, around, the, 8th, or, 7th, century, bc, and, by, the, mid, 6th, century, bc, had, become, part, of, the, greek, literary, canon, in, antiquity, homer, s, authorship, of, the, poem, was, not, questioned, but, contemporary, scholarship, predominantly, assumes, that, the, iliad, and, the, odyssey, were, composed, independently, and, that, the, stories, formed, as, part, of, a, long, oral, tradition, given, widespread, illiteracy, the, poem, was, performed, by, an, aoidos, or, rhapsode, and, was, more, likely, to, be, heard, than, read, crucial, themes, in, the, poem, include, the, ideas, of, nostos, return, wandering, xenia, guest, friendship, testing, and, omens, scholars, still, reflect, on, the, narrative, significance, of, certain, groups, in, the, poem, such, as, women, and, slaves, who, have, a, more, prominent, role, in, the, epic, than, in, many, other, works, of, ancient, literature, this, focus, is, especially, remarkable, when, contrasted, with, the, iliad, which, centres, the, exploits, of, soldiers, and, kings, during, the, trojan, war, the, odyssey, is, regarded, as, one, of, the, most, significant, works, of, the, western, canon, the, first, english, translation, of, the, odyssey, was, in, the, 16th, century, adaptations, and, re, imaginings, continue, to, be, produced, across, a, wide, variety, of, media, in, 2018, when, bbc, culture, polled, experts, around, the, world, to, find, literature, s,

search, for, news, of, his, father, he, offers, her, hospitality, and, they, observe, the, suitors, dining, rowdily, while, phemius, the, bard, performs, a, narrative, poem, for, them, that, night, athena, disguised, as, telemachus, finds, a, ship, and, crew, for, the, true, prince, the, next, morning, telemachus, calls, an, assembly, of, citizens, of, ithaca, to, discuss, what, should, be, done, with, the, insolent, suitors, who, then, scoff, at, telemachus, accompanied, by, athena, now, disguised, as, mentor, the, son, of, odysseus, departs, for, the, greek, mainland, to, the, household, of, nestor, most, venerable, of, the, greek, warriors, at, troy, who, resided, in, pylos, after, the, war, from, there, telemachus, rides, to, sparta, accompanied, by, nestor, s, son, there, he, finds, menelaus, and, helen, who, are, now, reconciled, both, helen, and, menelaus, also, say, that, they, returned, to, sparta, after, a, long, voyage, by, way, of, egypt, there, on, the,

agamemnon, king, of, mycenae, and, leader, of, the, greeks, at, troy, he, was, murdered, on, his, return, home, by, his, wife, clytemnestra, and, her, lover, aegisthus, the, story, briefly, shifts, to, the, suitors, who, have, only, just, realized, that, telemachus, is, gone, angry, they, formulate, a, plan, to, ambush, his, ship, and, kill, him, as, he, sails, back, home, penelope, overhears, their, plot, and, worries, for, her, son, s, safety, in, the, course, of, odysseus, seven, years, as, a, captive, of, calypso, on, the, island, ogygia, she, has, fallen, deeply, in, love, with, him, even, though, he, spurns, her, offers, of, immortality, as, her, husband, and, still, mourns, for, home, she, is, ordered, to, release, him, by, the, messenger, god, hermes, who, has, been, sent, by, zeus, in, response, to, athena, s, plea, odysseus, builds, a, raft, and, is, given, clothing, food, and, drink, by, calypso, when, poseidon, learns, that, odysseus, has, escaped, he, wrecks, the, raft, but, helped, by, a, veil, given, by, the, sea, nymph, ino, odysseus, swims, ashore, on, scherie, the, island, of, the, phaeacians, naked, and, exhausted, he, hides, in, a, pile, of, leaves, and, falls, asleep, the, next, morning, awakened, by, girls, laughter, he, sees, the, young, nausica, who, has, gone, to, the, seashore, with, her, maids, after, athena, told, her, in, a, dream, to, do, so, he, appeals, for, help, she, encourages, him, to, seek, the, hospitality, of, her, parents, arete, and, alcinous, alcinous, promises, to, provide, him, a, ship, to, return, him, home, without, knowing, the, identity, of, odysseus, he, remains, for, several, days, odysseus, asks, the, blind, singer, demodocus, to, tell, the, story, of, the, trojan, horse, a, stratagem, in, which, odysseus, had, played, a, leading, role, unable, to, hide, his, emotion, as, he, relives, this, episode, odysseus, at, last, reveals, his, identity, he, then, tells, the, story, of, his, return, from, troy, odysseus, recounts, his, story, to, the, phaeacians, after, a, failed, raid, against, the, cicones, odysseus, and, his, twelve, ships, were, driven, off, course, by, storms, odysseus, visited, the, lotus, eaters, who, gave, his, men, their, fruit, which, caused, them, to, forget, their, homecoming, odysseus, had, to, drag, them, back, to, the, ship, by, force, afterward, odysseus, and, his, men, landed, on, a, lush, uninhabited, island, near, the, land, of, the, cyclopes, the, men, entered, the, cave, of, polyphemus, where, they, found, all, the, cheeses, and, meat, they, desired, upon, returning, to, his, cave, polyphemus, sealed, the, entrance, with, a, massive, boulder, and, proceeded, to, eat, odysseus, men, odysseus, devised, an, escape, plan, in, which, he, identifying, himself, as, nobody, plied, polyphemus, with, wine, and, blinded, him, with, a, wooden, stake, when, polyphemus, cried, out, his, neighbors, left, after, polyphemus, claimed, that, nobody, had, attacked, him, odysseus, and, his, men, finally, escaped, the, cave, by, hiding, on, the, underbellies, of, the, sheep, as, they, were, let, out, of, the, cave, as, they, escaped, however, odysseus, taunted, polyphemus, and, revealed, himself, the, cyclops, prayed, to, his, father, poseidon, asking, him, to, curse, odysseus, to, wander, for, ten, years, after, the, escape, aeolus, gave, odysseus, a, leather, bag, containing, all, the, winds, except, the, west, wind, a, gift, that, should, have, ensured, a, safe, return, home, just, as, ithaca, came, into, sight, the, sailors, opened, the, bag, while, odysseus, slept, thinking, it, contained, gold, the, winds, flew, out, and, the, storm, drove, the, ships, back, the, way, they, had, come, aeolus, recognizing, that, odysseus, had, drawn, the, ire, of, the, gods, refused, to, further, assist, him, after, the, cannibalistic, laestrygonians, destroyed, all, of, his, ships, except, his, own, odysseus, sailed, on, and, reached, the, island, of, aeaea, home, of, witch, goddess, circe, she, turned, half, of, his, men, into, swine, with, drugged, cheese, and, wine, hermes, warned, odysseus, about, circe, and, gave, odysseus, an, herb, called, moly, making, him, resistant, to, circe, s, magic, odysseus, forced, circe, to, change, his, men, back, to, their, human, forms, and, was, seduced, by, her, they, remained, with, her, for, one, year, finally, guided, by, circe, s, instructions, odysseus, and, his, crew, crossed, the, ocean, and, reached, a, harbor, at, the, western, edge, of, the, world, where, odysseus, sacrificed, to, the, dead, odysseus, summoned, the, spirit, of, the, prophet, tiresias, and, was, told, that, he, may, return, home, if, he, is, able, to, stay, himself, and, his, crew, from, eating, the, sacred, livestock, of, helios, on, the, island, of, thrinacia, and, that, failure, to, do, so, would, result, in, the, loss, of, his, ship, and, his, entire, crew, he, then, meets, his, dead, mother, anticleia, and, first, learns, of, the, suitors, and, what, happened, in, ithaca, in, his, absence, odysseus, also, converses, with, his, dead, comrades, from, troy, returning, to, aeaea, they, buried, elpenor, and, were, advised, by, circe, on, the, remaining, stages, of, the, journey, they, skirted, the, land, of, the, sirens, all, of, the, sailors, had, their, ears, plugged, up, with, beeswax, except, for, odysseus, who, was, tied, to, the, mast, as, he, wanted, to, hear, the, song, he, told, his, sailors, not, to, untie, him, as, it, would, only, make, him, drown, himself, they, then, passed, between, the, six, headed, monster, scylla, and, the, whirlpool, charybdis, scylla, claimed, six, of, his, men, next, they, landed, on, the, island, of, thrinacia, with, the, crew, overriding, odysseus, s, wishes, to, remain, away, from, the, island, zeus, caused, a, storm, that, prevented, them, from, leaving, causing, them, to, deplete, the, food, given, to, them, by, circe, while, odysseus, was, away, praying, his, men, ignored, the, warnings, of, tiresias, and, circe, and, hunted, the, sacred, cattle, helios, insisted, that, zeus, punish, the, men, for, this, sacrilege, they, suffered, a, shipwreck, and, all, but, odysseus, drowned, as, he, clung, to, a, fig, tree, washed, ashore, on, ogygia, he, remained, there, as, calypso, s, lover, having, listened, to, his, story, the, phaeacians, agree, to, provide, odysseus, with, more, treasure, than, he, would, have, received, from, the, spoils, of, troy, they, deliver, him, at, night, while, he, is, fast, asleep, to, a, hidden, harbour, on, ithaca, odysseus, awakens, and, believes, that, he, has, been, dropped, on, a, distant, land, before, athena, appears, to, him, and, reveals, that, he, is, indeed, on, ithaca, she, hides, his, treasure, in, a, nearby, cave, and, disguises, him, as, an, elderly, beggar, so, he, can, see, how, things, stand, in, his, household, he, finds, his, way, to, the, hut, of, one, of, his, own, slaves, swineherd, eumaeus, who, treats, him, hospitably, and, speaks, favorably, of, odysseus, after, dinner, the, disguised, odysseus, tells, the, farm, laborers, a, fictitious, tale, of, himself, telemachus, sails, home, from, sparta, evading, an, ambush, set, by, the, suitors, he, disembarks, on, the, coast, of, ithaca, and, meets, odysseus, odysseus, identifies, himself, to, telemachus, but, not, to, eumaeus, and, they, decide, that, the, suitors, must, be, killed, telemachus, goes, home, first, accompanied, by, eumaeus, odysseus, returns, to, his, own, house, still, pretending, to, be, a, beggar, he, is, ridiculed, by, the, suitors, in, his, own, home, especially, antinous, odysseus, meets, penelope, and, tests, her, intentions, by, saying, he, once, met, odysseus, in, crete, closely, questioned, he, adds, that, he, had, recently, been, in, thesprotia, and, had, learned, something, there, of, odysseus, s, recent, wanderings, odysseus, s, identity, is, discovered, by, the, housekeeper, eurycleia, when, she, recognizes, an, old, scar, as, she, is, washing, his, feet, eurycleia, tries, to, tell, penelope, about, the, beggar, s, true, identity, but, athena, makes, sure, that, penelope, cannot, hear, her, odysseus, swears, eurycleia, to, secrecy, the, next, day, at, athena, s, prompting, penelope, maneuvers, the, suitors, into, competing, for, her, hand, with, an, archery, competition, using, odysseus, s, bow, the, man, who, can, string, the, bow, and, shoot, an, arrow, through, a, dozen, axe, heads, would, win, odysseus, takes, part, in, the, competition, and, he, alone, is, strong, enough, to, string, the, bow, and, shoot, the, arrow, through, the, dozen, axe, heads, making, him, the, winner, he, then, throws, off, his, rags, and, kills, antinous, with, his, next, arrow, odysseus, kills, the, other, suitors, first, using, the, rest, of, the, arrows, and, then, along, with, telemachus, eumaeus, and, the, cowherd, philoetius, with, swords, and, spears, once, the, battle, is, won, telemachus, also, hangs, twelve, of, their, household, maids, whom, eurycleia, identifies, as, guilty, of, betraying, penelope, or, having, sex, with, the, suitors, odysseus, identifies, himself, to, penelope, she, is, hesitant, but, recognizes, him, when, he, mentions, that, he, made, their, bed, from, an, olive, tree, still, rooted, to, the, ground, she, embraces, him, and, they, sleep, the, next, day, odysseus, goes, to, his, father, laertes, s, farm, and, reveals, himself, following, them, to, the, farm, is, a, group, of, ithacans, led, by, eupeithes, father, of, antinous, who, are, out, for, revenge, for, the, murder, of, the, suitors, a, battle, breaks, out, but, it, is, quickly, stopped, by, athena, and, zeus, the, odyssey, is, 12, 109, lines, composed, in, dactylic, hexameter, also, called, homeric, hexameter, it, opens, in, medias, res, in, the, middle, of, the, overall, story, with, prior, events, described, through, flashbacks, and, storytelling, the, 24, books, correspond, to, the, letters, of, the, greek, alphabet, the, division, was, likely, made, after, the, poem, s, composition, by, someone, other, than, homer, but, is, generally, accepted, in, the, classical, period, some, of, the, books, individually, and, in, groups, were, commonly, given, their, own, titles, book, 22, concludes, the, greek, epic, cycle, though, fragments, remain, of, the, alternative, ending, of, sorts, known, as, the, telegony, the, telegony, aside, the, last, 548, lines, of, the, odyssey, corresponding, to, book, 24, are, believed, by, many, scholars, to, have, been, added, by, a, slightly, later, poet, the, events, in, the, main, sequence, of, the, odyssey, excluding, odysseus, embedded, narrative, of, his, wanderings, have, been, said, to, take, place, in, the, peloponnese, and, in, what, are, now, called, the, ionian, islands, there, are, difficulties, in, the, apparently, simple, identification, of, ithaca, the, homeland, of, odysseus, which, may, or, may, not, be, the, same, island, that, is, now, called, ithak, modern, greek, the, wanderings, of, odysseus, as, told, to, the, phaeacians, and, the, location, of, the, phaeacians, own, island, of, scheria, pose, more, fundamental, problems, if, geography, is, to, be, applied, scholars, both, ancient, and, modern, are, divided, as, to, whether, any, of, the, places, visited, by, odysseus, after, ismaros, and, before, his, return, to, ithaca, are, real, both, antiquated, and, contemporary, scholars, have, attempted, to, map, odysseus, journey, but, now, largely, agree, that, the, landscapes, especially, of, the, apologia, books, 9, to, 11, include, too, many, mythological, aspects, as, features, to, be, unequivocally, mappable, classicist, peter, t, struck, created, an, interactive, map, which, plots, odysseus, travels, including, his, near, homecoming, which, was, thwarted, by, the, bag, of, wind, scholars, have, seen, strong, influences, from, near, eastern, mythology, and, literature, in, the, odyssey, martin, west, notes, substantial, parallels, between, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, and, the, odyssey, both, odysseus, and, gilgamesh, are, known, for, traveling, to, the, ends, of, the, earth, and, on, their, journeys, go, to, the, land, of, the, dead, on, his, voyage, to, the, underworld, odysseus, follows, instructions, given, to, him, by, circe, who, is, located, at, the, edges, of, the, world, and, is, associated, through, imagery, with, the, sun, like, odysseus, gilgamesh, gets, directions, on, how, to, reach, the, land, of, the, dead, from, a, divine, helper, the, goddess, siduri, who, like, circe, dwells, by, the, sea, at, the, ends, of, the, earth, whose, home, is, also, associated, with, the, sun, gilgamesh, reaches, siduri, s, house, by, passing, through, a, tunnel, underneath, mt, mashu, the, high, mountain, from, which, the, sun, comes, into, the, sky, west, argues, that, the, similarity, of, odysseus, and, gilgamesh, s, journeys, to, the, edges, of, the, earth, are, the, result, of, the, influence, of, the, gilgamesh, epic, upon, the, odyssey, in, 1914, paleontologist, othenio, abel, surmised, the, origins, of, the, cyclops, to, be, the, result, of, ancient, greeks, finding, an, elephant, skull, the, enormous, nasal, passage, in, the, middle, of, the, forehead, could, have, looked, like, the, eye, socket, of, a, giant, to, those, who, had, never, seen, a, living, elephant, classical, scholars, on, the, other, hand, have, long, known, that, the, story, of, the, cyclops, was, originally, a, folk, tale, which, existed, independently, of, the, odyssey, and, which, became, part, of, it, at, a, later, date, similar, stories, are, found, in, cultures, across, europe, and, the, middle, east, according, to, this, explanation, the, cyclops, was, originally, simply, a, giant, or, ogre, much, like, humbaba, in, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, graham, anderson, suggests, that, the, addition, about, it, having, only, one, eye, was, invented, to, explain, how, the, creature, was, so, easily, blinded, homecoming, ancient, greek, nostos, is, a, central, theme, of, the, odyssey, anna, bonafazi, of, the, university, of, cologne, writes, that, in, homer, nostos, is, return, home, from, troy, by, sea, agatha, thornton, examines, nostos, in, the, context, of, characters, other, than, odysseus, in, order, to, provide, an, alternative, for, what, might, happen, after, the, end, of, the, odyssey, for, instance, one, example, is, that, of, agamemnon, s, homecoming, versus, odysseus, upon, agamemnon, s, return, his, wife, clytemnestra, and, her, lover, aegisthus, kill, agamemnon, agamemnon, s, son, orestes, out, of, vengeance, for, his, father, s, death, kills, aegisthus, this, parallel, compares, the, death, of, the, suitors, to, the, death, of, aegisthus, and, sets, orestes, up, as, an, example, for, telemachus, also, because, odysseus, knows, about, clytemnestra, s, betrayal, odysseus, returns, home, in, disguise, in, order, to, test, the, loyalty, of, his, own, wife, penelope, later, agamemnon, praises, penelope, for, not, killing, odysseus, it, is, because, of, penelope, that, odysseus, has, fame, and, a, successful, homecoming, this, successful, homecoming, is, unlike, achilles, who, has, fame, but, is, dead, and, agamemnon, who, had, an, unsuccessful, homecoming, resulting, in, his, death, only, two, of, odysseus, s, adventures, are, described, by, the, narrator, the, rest, of, odysseus, adventures, are, recounted, by, odysseus, himself, the, two, scenes, described, by, the, narrator, are, odysseus, on, calypso, s, island, and, odysseus, encounter, with, the, phaeacians, these, scenes, are, told, by, the, poet, to, represent, an, important, transition, in, odysseus, journey, being, concealed, to, returning, home, calypso, s, name, comes, from, the, greek, word, kal, pt, meaning, to, cover, or, conceal, which, is, apt, as, this, is, exactly, what, she, does, with, odysseus, calypso, keeps, odysseus, concealed, from, the, world, and, unable, to, return, home, after, leaving, calypso, s, island, the, poet, describes, odysseus, encounters, with, the, phaeacians, those, who, convoy, without, hurt, to, all, men, which, represents, his, transition, from, not, returning, home, to, returning, home, also, during, odysseus, journey, he, encounters, many, beings, that, are, close, to, the, gods, these, encounters, are, useful, in, understanding, that, odysseus, is, in, a, world, beyond, man, and, that, influences, the, fact, he, cannot, return, home, these, beings, that, are, close, to, the, gods, include, the, phaeacians, who, lived, near, the, cyclopes, whose, king, alcinous, is, the, great, grandson, of, the, king, of, the, giants, eurymedon, and, the, grandson, of, poseidon, some, of, the, other, characters, that, odysseus, encounters, are, the, cyclops, polyphemus, the, son, of, poseidon, circe, a, sorceress, who, turns, men, into, animals, and, the, cannibalistic, giants, the, laestrygonians, throughout, the, course, of, the, epic, odysseus, encounters, several, examples, of, xenia, guest, friendship, which, provide, models, of, how, hosts, should, and, should, not, act, the, phaeacians, demonstrate, exemplary, guest, friendship, by, feeding, odysseus, giving, him, a, place, to, sleep, and, granting, him, many, gifts, and, a, safe, voyage, home, which, are, all, things, a, good, host, should, do, polyphemus, demonstrates, poor, guest, friendship, his, only, gift, to, odysseus, is, that, he, will, eat, him, last, calypso, also, exemplifies, poor, guest, friendship, because, she, does, not, allow, odysseus, to, leave, her, island, another, important, factor, to, guest, friendship, is, that, kingship, implies, generosity, it, is, assumed, that, a, king, has, the, means, to, be, a, generous, host, and, is, more, generous, with, his, own, property, this, is, best, seen, when, odysseus, disguised, as, a, beggar, begs, antinous, one, of, the, suitors, for, food, and, antinous, denies, his, request, odysseus, essentially, says, that, while, antinous, may, look, like, a, king, he, is, far, from, a, king, since, he, is, not, generous, according, to, j, b, hainsworth, guest, friendship, follows, a, very, specific, pattern, another, important, factor, of, guest, friendship, is, not, keeping, the, guest, longer, than, they, wish, and, also, promising, their, safety, while, they, are, a, guest, within, the, host, s, home, another, theme, throughout, the, odyssey, is, testing, this, occurs, in, two, distinct, ways, odysseus, tests, the, loyalty, of, others, and, others, test, odysseus, identity, an, example, of, odysseus, testing, the, loyalties, of, others, is, when, he, returns, home, instead, of, immediately, revealing, his, identity, he, arrives, disguised, as, a, beggar, and, then, proceeds, to, determine, who, in, his, house, has, remained, loyal, to, him, and, who, has, helped, the, suitors, after, odysseus, reveals, his, true, identity, the, characters, test, odysseus, identity, to, see, if, he, really, is, who, he, says, he, is, for, instance, penelope, tests, odysseus, identity, by, saying, that, she, will, move, the, bed, into, the, other, room, for, him, this, is, a, difficult, task, since, it, is, made, out, of, a, living, tree, that, would, require, being, cut, down, a, fact, that, only, the, real, odysseus, would, know, thus, proving, his, identity, testing, also, has, a, very, specific, type, scene, that, accompanies, it, throughout, the, epic, the, testing, of, others, follows, a, typical, pattern, this, pattern, is, omens, occur, frequently, throughout, the, odyssey, within, the, epic, poem, they, frequently, involve, birds, according, to, thornton, most, crucial, is, who, receives, each, omen, and, in, what, way, it, manifests, for, instance, bird, omens, are, shown, to, telemachus, penelope, odysseus, and, the, suitors, telemachus, and, penelope, receive, their, omens, as, well, in, the, form, of, words, sneezes, and, dreams, however, odysseus, is, the, only, character, who, receives, thunder, or, lightning, as, an, omen, she, highlights, this, as, crucial, because, lightning, as, a, symbol, of, zeus, represents, the, kingship, of, odysseus, odysseus, is, associated, with, zeus, throughout, both, the, iliad, and, the, odyssey, omens, are, another, example, of, a, type, scene, in, the, odyssey, two, important, parts, of, an, omen, type, scene, are, the, recognition, of, the, omen, followed, by, its, interpretation, in, the, odyssey, all, of, the, bird, omens, with, the, exception, of, the, first, show, large, birds, attacking, smaller, birds, accompanying, each, omen, is, a, wish, which, can, be, either, explicitly, stated, or, only, implied, for, example, telemachus, wishes, for, vengeance, and, for, odysseus, to, be, home, penelope, wishes, for, odysseus, return, and, the, suitors, wish, for, the, death, of, telemachus, the, date, of, the, poem, is, a, matter, of, some, disagreement, among, classicists, in, the, middle, of, the, 8th, century, bc, the, inhabitants, of, greece, began, to, adopt, a, modified, version, of, the, phoenician, alphabet, to, write, down, their, own, language, the, homeric, poems, may, have, been, one, of, the, earliest, products, of, that, literacy, and, if, so, would, have, been, composed, some, time, in, the, late, 8th, century, bc, inscribed, on, a, clay, cup, found, in, ischia, italy, are, the, words, nestor, s, cup, good, to, drink, from, some, scholars, such, as, calvert, watkins, have, tied, this, cup, to, a, description, of, king, nestor, s, golden, cup, in, the, iliad, if, the, cup, is, an, allusion, to, the, iliad, that, poem, s, composition, can, be, dated, to, at, least, 700, 750, bc, dating, is, similarly, complicated, by, the, fact, that, the, homeric, poems, or, sections, of, them, were, performed, regularly, by, rhapsodes, for, several, hundred, years, the, odyssey, as, it, exists, today, is, likely, not, significantly, different, aside, from, minor, differences, the, homeric, poems, gained, a, canonical, place, in, the, institutions, of, ancient, athens, by, the, 6th, century, in, 566, bc, peisistratos, instituted, a, civic, and, religious, festival, called, the, panathenaia, which, featured, performances, of, homeric, poems, these, are, significant, because, a, correct, version, of, the, poems, had, to, be, performed, indicating, that, a, particular, version, of, the, text, had, become, canonised, the, iliad, and, the, odyssey, were, widely, copied, and, used, as, school, texts, in, lands, where, the, greek, language, was, spoken, throughout, antiquity, scholars, may, have, begun, to, write, commentaries, on, the, poems, as, early, as, the, time, of, aristotle, in, the, 4th, century, bc, in, the, 3rd, and, 2nd, centuries, bc, scholars, affiliated, with, the, library, of, alexandria, particularly, zenodotus, and, aristarchus, of, samothrace, edited, the, homeric, poems, wrote, commentaries, on, them, and, helped, establish, the, canonical, texts, the, iliad, and, the, odyssey, remained, widely, studied, and, used, as, school, texts, in, the, byzantine, empire, during, the, middle, ages, the, byzantine, greek, scholar, and, archbishop, eustathios, of, thessalonike, c, 1115, c, 1195, 6, ad, wrote, exhaustive, commentaries, on, both, of, the, homeric, epics, that, became, seen, by, later, generations, as, authoritative, his, commentary, on, the, odyssey, alone, spans, nearly, 2, 000, oversized, pages, in, a, twentieth, century, edition, the, first, printed, edition, of, the, odyssey, known, as, the, editio, princeps, was, produced, in, 1488, by, the, greek, scholar, demetrios, chalkokondyles, who, had, been, born, in, athens, and, had, studied, in, constantinople, his, edition, was, printed, in, milan, by, a, greek, printer, named, antonios, damilas, since, the, late, 19th, century, many, papyri, containing, fragments, of, the, odyssey, have, been, found, in, egypt, some, with, content, different, from, later, medieval, versions, in, 2018, the, greek, cultural, ministry, revealed, the, discovery, of, a, clay, tablet, near, the, temple, of, zeus, at, olympia, containing, 13, verses, from, the, odyssey, s, 14th, book, while, it, was, initially, reported, to, date, from, the, 3rd, century, ad, the, date, is, unconfirmed, george, chapman, s, english, translations, of, the, odyssey, and, the, iliad, published, together, in, 1616, but, serialised, earlier, were, the, first, to, enjoy, widespread, success, the, texts, had, been, published, in, translation, before, with, some, translated, not, from, the, original, greek, chapman, worked, on, these, for, a, large, part, of, his, life, in, 1581, arthur, hall, translated, the, first, 10, books, of, the, iliad, from, a, french, version, chapman, s, translations, persisted, in, popularity, and, are, often, remembered, today, through, john, keats, sonnet, on, first, looking, into, chapman, s, homer, 1816, years, after, completing, his, translation, of, the, iliad, alexander, pope, began, to, translate, the, odyssey, because, of, his, financial, situation, his, second, translation, was, not, received, as, favourably, as, the, first, emily, wilson, a, professor, of, classical, studies, at, the, university, of, pennsylvania, notes, that, as, late, as, the, first, decade, of, the, 21st, century, almost, all, of, the, most, prominent, translators, of, greek, and, roman, literature, had, been, men, she, calls, her, experience, of, translating, homer, one, of, intimate, alienation, wilson, writes, that, this, has, affected, the, popular, conception, of, characters, and, events, of, the, odyssey, inflecting, the, story, with, connotations, not, present, in, the, original, text, for, instance, in, the, scene, where, telemachus, oversees, the, hanging, of, the, slaves, who, have, been, sleeping, with, the, suitors, most, translations, introduce, derogatory, language, sluts, or, whores, the, original, greek, does, not, label, these, slaves, with, derogatory, language, in, the, original, greek, the, word, used, is, hai, the, feminine, article, equivalent, to, those, female, people, the, influence, of, the, homeric, texts, can, be, difficult, to, summarise, because, of, how, greatly, they, have, impacted, the, popular, imagination, and, cultural, values, the, odyssey, and, the, iliad, formed, the, basis, of, education, for, members, of, ancient, mediterranean, society, that, curriculum, was, adopted, by, western, humanists, meaning, the, text, was, so, much, a, part, of, the, cultural, fabric, that,
