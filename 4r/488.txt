of, forms, that, cascaded, down, the, walls, it, featured, molding, formed, into, curves, and, counter, curves, twisting, and, turning, patterns, ceilings, and, walls, with, no, right, angles, and, stucco, foliage, which, seemed, to, be, creeping, up, the, walls, and, across, the, ceiling, the, decoration, was, often, gilded, or, silvered, to, give, it, contrast, with, the, white, or, pale,

particularly, the, stairways, and, ceilings, was, much, lighter, and, decorative, the, prince, bishop, imported, the, italian, rococo, painter, giovanni, battista, tiepolo, in, 1750, 1753, to, create, a, mural, over, the, top, of, the, three, level, ceremonial, stairway, neumann, described, the, interior, of, the, residence, as, a, theatre, of, light, the, stairway, was, also, the, central, element, in, a, residence, neumann, built, at, the, augustusburg, palace, in, br, hl, 1743, 1748, in, that, building, the, stairway, led, the, visitors, up, through, a, stucco, fantasy, of, paintings,

of, the, facade, and, the, overabundance, of, decoration, in, the, interior, in, great, britain, rococo, was, called, the, french, taste, and, had, less, influence, on, design, and, the, decorative, arts, than, in, continental, europe, although, its, influence, was, felt, in, such, areas, as, silverwork, porcelain, and, silks, william, hogarth, helped, develop, a, theoretical, foundation, for, rococo, beauty, though, not, mentioning, rococo, by, name, he, argued, in, his, analysis, of, beauty, 1753, that, the, undulating, lines, and, s, curves, prominent, in, rococo, were, the, basis, for, grace, and, beauty, in, art, or, nature, unlike, the, straight, line, or, the, circle, in, classicism, rococo, was, slow, in, arriving, in, england, before, entering, the, rococo, british, furniture,
