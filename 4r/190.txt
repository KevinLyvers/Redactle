her, that, kurtz, s, final, word, was, her, name, the, novella, was, not, a, big, success, during, conrad, s, life, when, it, was, published, as, a, single, volume, in, 1902, with, two, novellas, youth, and, the, end, of, the, tether, it, received, the, least, commentary, from, critics, f, r, leavis, referred, to, heart, of, darkness, as, a, minor, work, and, criticised, its, adjectival, insistence, upon, inexpressible, and, incomprehensible, mystery, conrad, did, not, consider, it, to, be, particularly, notable, but, by, the, 1960s, it, was, a, standard, assignment, in, many, college, and, high, school, english, courses, literary, critic, harold, bloom, wrote, that, heart, of, darkness, had, been, analysed, more, than, any, other, work, of, literature, that, is, studied, in, universities, and, colleges, which, he, attributed, to, conrad, s, unique, propensity, for, ambiguity, in, king, leopold, s, ghost, 1998, adam, hochschild, wrote, that, literary, scholars, have, made, too, much, of, the, psychological, aspects, of, heart, of, darkness, while, paying, scant, attention, to, conrad, s, accurate, recounting, of, the, horror, arising, from, the, methods, and, effects, of, colonialism, in, the, congo, free, state, heart, of, darkness, is, experience, pushed, a, little, and, only, very, little, beyond, the, actual, facts, of, the, case, other, critiques, include, hugh, curtler, s, achebe, on, conrad, racism, and, greatness, in, heart, of, darkness, 1997, the, french, philosopher, philippe, lacoue, labarthe, called, heart, of, darkness, one, of, the, greatest, texts, of, western, literature, and, used, conrad, s, tale, for, a, reflection, on, the, horror, of, the, west, heart, of, darkness, is, criticised, in, postcolonial, studies, particularly, by, nigerian, novelist, chinua, achebe, in, his, 1975, public, lecture, an, image, of, africa, racism, in, conrad, s, heart, of, darkness, achebe, described, conrad, s, novella, as, an, offensive, and, deplorable, book, that, de, humanised, africans, achebe, argued, that, conrad, blinkered, with, xenophobia, incorrectly, depicted, africa, as, the, antithesis, of, europe, and, civilisation, ignoring, the, artistic, accomplishments, of, the, fang, people, who, lived, in, the, congo, river, basin, at, the, time, of, the, book, s, publication, he, argued, that, the, book, promoted, and, continues, to, promote, a, prejudiced, image, of, africa, that, depersonalises, a, portion, of, the, human, race, and, concluded, that, it, should, not, be, considered, a, great, work, of, art, achebe, s, critics, argue, that, he, fails, to, distinguish, marlow, s, view, from, conrad, s, which, results, in, very, clumsy, interpretations, of, the, novella, in, their, view, conrad, portrays, africans, sympathetically, and, their, plight, tragically, and, refers, sarcastically, to, and, condemns, outright, the, supposedly, noble, aims, of, european, colonists, thereby, demonstrating, his, scepticism, about, the, moral, superiority, of, european, men, ending, a, passage, that, describes, the, condition, of, chained, emaciated, slaves, marlow, remarks, after, all, i, also, was, a, part, of, the, great, cause, of, these, high, and, just, proceedings, some, observers, assert, that, conrad, whose, native, country, had, been, conquered, by, imperial, powers, empathised, by, default, with, other, subjugated, peoples, jeffrey, meyers, notes, that, conrad, like, his, acquaintance, roger, casement, was, one, of, the, first, men, to, question, the, western, notion, of, progress, a, dominant, idea, in, europe, from, the, renaissance, to, the, great, war, to, attack, the, hypocritical, justification, of, colonialism, and, to, reveal, the, savage, degradation, of, the, white, man, in, africa, 100, 01, likewise, e, d, morel, who, led, international, opposition, to, king, leopold, ii, s, rule, in, the, congo, saw, conrad, s, heart, of, darkness, as, a, condemnation, of, colonial, brutality, and, referred, to, the, novella, as, the, most, powerful, thing, written, on, the, subject, conrad, scholar, peter, firchow, writes, that, nowhere, in, the, novel, does, conrad, or, any, of, his, narrators, personified, or, otherwise, claim, superiority, on, the, part, of, europeans, on, the, grounds, of, alleged, genetic, or, biological, difference, if, conrad, or, his, novel, is, racist, it, is, only, in, a, weak, sense, since, heart, of, darkness, acknowledges, racial, distinctions, but, does, not, suggest, an, essential, superiority, of, any, group, achebe, s, reading, of, heart, of, darkness, can, be, and, has, been, challenged, by, a, reading, of, conrad, s, other, african, story, an, outpost, of, progress, which, has, an, omniscient, narrator, rather, than, the, embodied, narrator, marlow, masood, ashraf, raja, has, suggested, that, conrad, s, positive, representation, of, muslims, in, his, malay, novels, complicates, these, charges, of, racism, in, 2003, motswana, scholar, peter, mwikisa, concluded, the, book, was, the, great, lost, opportunity, to, depict, dialogue, between, africa, and, europe, zimbabwean, scholar, rino, zhuwarara, however, broadly, agreed, with, achebe, though, considered, it, important, to, be, sensitised, to, how, peoples, of, other, nations, perceive, africa, the, novelist, caryl, phillips, stated, in, 2003, that, achebe, is, right, to, the, african, reader, the, price, of, conrad, s, eloquent, denunciation, of, colonisation, is, the, recycling, of, racist, notions, of, the, dark, continent, and, her, people, those, of, us, who, are, not, from, africa, may, be, prepared, to, pay, this, price, but, this, price, is, far, too, high, for, achebe, in, his, 1983, criticism, the, british, academic, cedric, watts, criticises, the, insinuation, in, achebe, s, critique, the, premise, that, only, black, people, may, accurately, analyse, and, assess, the, novella, as, well, as, mentioning, that, achebe, s, critique, falls, into, self, contradictory, arguments, regarding, conrad, s, writing, style, both, praising, and, denouncing, it, at, times, stan, galloway, writes, in, a, comparison, of, heart, of, darkness, with, jungle, tales, of, tarzan, the, inhabitants, whether, antagonists, or, compatriots, were, clearly, imaginary, and, meant, to, represent, a, particular, fictive, cipher, and, not, a, particular, african, people, more, recent, critics, like, nidesh, lawtoo, have, stressed, that, the, continuities, between, conrad, and, achebe, are, profound, and, that, a, form, of, postcolonial, mimesis, ties, the, two, authors, via, productive, mirroring, inversions, orson, welles, adapted, and, starred, in, heart, of, darkness, in, a, cbs, radio, broadcast, on, 6, november, 1938, as, part,
