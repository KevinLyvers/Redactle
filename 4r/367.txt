opera, often, referred, to, as, number, opera, consists, of, two, modes, of, singing, recitative, the, plot, driving, passages, sung, in, a, style, designed, to, imitate, and, emphasize, the, inflections, of, speech, and, aria, an, air, or, formal, song, in, which, the, characters, express, their, emotions, in, a, more, structured, melodic, style, vocal, duets, trios, and, other, ensembles, often, occur, and, choruses, are, used, to, comment, on, the, action, in, some, forms, of, opera, such, as, singspiel, op, ra, comique, operetta, and, semi, opera, the, recitative, is, mostly, replaced, by, spoken, dialogue, melodic, or, semi, melodic, passages, occurring, in, the, midst, of, or, instead, of, recitative, are, also, referred, to, as, arioso, the, terminology, of, the, various, kinds, of, operatic, voices, is, described, in, detail, below, during, both, the, baroque, and, classical, periods, recitative, could, appear, in, two, basic, forms, each, of, which, was, accompanied, by, a, different, instrumental, ensemble, secco, dry, recitative, sung, with, a, free, rhythm, dictated, by, the, accent, of, the, words, accompanied, only, by, basso, continuo, which, was, usually, a, harpsichord, and, a, cello, or, accompagnato, also, known, as, strumentato, in, which, the, orchestra, provided, accompaniment, over, the, 18th, century, arias, were, increasingly, accompanied, by, the, orchestra, by, the, 19th, century, accompagnato, had, gained, the, upper, hand, the, orchestra, played, a, much, bigger, role, and, wagner, revolutionized, opera, by, abolishing, almost, all, distinction, between, aria, and, recitative, in, his, quest, for, what, wagner, termed, endless, melody, subsequent, composers, have, tended, to, follow, wagner, s, example, though, some, such, as, stravinsky, in, his, the, rake, s, progress, have, bucked, the, trend, the, changing, role, of, the, orchestra, in, opera, is, described, in, more, detail, below, the, italian, word, opera, means, work, both, in, the, sense, of, the, labour, done, and, the, result, produced, the, italian, word, derives, from, the, latin, word, opera, a, singular, noun, meaning, work, and, also, the, plural, of, the, noun, opus, according, to, the, oxford, english, dictionary, the, italian, word, was, first, used, in, the, sense, composition, in, which, poetry, dance, and, music, are, combined, in, 1639, the, first, recorded, english, usage, in, this, sense, dates, to, 1648, dafne, by, jacopo, peri, was, the, earliest, composition, considered, opera, as, understood, today, it, was, written, around, 1597, largely, under, the, inspiration, of, an, elite, circle, of, literate, florentine, humanists, who, gathered, as, the, camerata, de, bardi, significantly, dafne, was, an, attempt, to, revive, the, classical, greek, drama, part, of, the, wider, revival, of, antiquity, characteristic, of, the, renaissance, the, members, of, the, camerata, considered, that, the, chorus, parts, of, greek, dramas, were, originally, sung, and, possibly, even, the, entire, text, of, all, roles, opera, was, thus, conceived, as, a, way, of, restoring, this, situation, dafne, however, is, lost, a, later, work, by, peri, euridice, dating, from, 1600, is, the, first, opera, score, to, have, survived, until, the, present, day, however, the, honour, of, being, the, first, opera, still, to, be, regularly, performed, goes, to, claudio, monteverdi, s, l, orfeo, composed, for, the, court, of, mantua, in, 1607, the, mantua, court, of, the, gonzagas, employers, of, monteverdi, played, a, significant, role, in, the, origin, of, opera, employing, not, only, court, singers, of, the, concerto, delle, donne, till, 1598, but, also, one, of, the, first, actual, opera, singers, madama, europa, opera, did, not, remain, confined, to, court, audiences, for, long, in, 1637, the, idea, of, a, season, often, during, the, carnival, of, publicly, attended, operas, supported, by, ticket, sales, emerged, in, venice, monteverdi, had, moved, to, the, city, from, mantua, and, composed, his, last, operas, il, ritorno, d, ulisse, in, patria, and, l, incoronazione, di, poppea, for, the, venetian, theatre, in, the, 1640s, his, most, important, follower, francesco, cavalli, helped, spread, opera, throughout, italy, in, these, early, baroque, operas, broad, comedy, was, blended, with, tragic, elements, in, a, mix, that, jarred, some, educated, sensibilities, sparking, the, first, of, opera, s, many, reform, movements, sponsored, by, the, arcadian, academy, which, came, to, be, associated, with, the, poet, metastasio, whose, libretti, helped, crystallize, the, genre, of, opera, seria, which, became, the, leading, form, of, italian, opera, until, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, once, the, metastasian, ideal, had, been, firmly, established, comedy, in, baroque, era, opera, was, reserved, for, what, came, to, be, called, opera, buffa, before, such, elements, were, forced, out, of, opera, seria, many, libretti, had, featured, a, separately, unfolding, comic, plot, as, sort, of, an, opera, within, an, opera, one, reason, for, this, was, an, attempt, to, attract, members, of, the, growing, merchant, class, newly, wealthy, but, still, not, as, cultured, as, the, nobility, to, the, public, opera, houses, these, separate, plots, were, almost, immediately, resurrected, in, a, separately, developing, tradition, that, partly, derived, from, the, commedia, dell, arte, a, long, flourishing, improvisatory, stage, tradition, of, italy, just, as, intermedi, had, once, been, performed, in, between, the, acts, of, stage, plays, operas, in, the, new, comic, genre, of, intermezzi, which, developed, largely, in, naples, in, the, 1710s, and, 1720s, were, initially, staged, during, the, intermissions, of, opera, seria, they, became, so, popular, however, that, they, were, soon, being, offered, as, separate, productions, opera, seria, was, elevated, in, tone, and, highly, stylised, in, form, usually, consisting, of, secco, recitative, interspersed, with, long, da, capo, arias, these, afforded, great, opportunity, for, virtuosic, singing, and, during, the, golden, age, of, opera, seria, the, singer, really, became, the, star, the, role, of, the, hero, was, usually, written, for, the, high, pitched, male, castrato, voice, which, was, produced, by, castration, of, the, singer, before, puberty, which, prevented, a, boy, s, larynx, from, being, transformed, at, puberty, castrati, such, as, farinelli, and, senesino, as, well, as, female, sopranos, such, as, faustina, bordoni, became, in, great, demand, throughout, europe, as, opera, seria, ruled, the, stage, in, every, country, except, france, farinelli, was, one, of, the, most, famous, singers, of, the, 18th, century, italian, opera, set, the, baroque, standard, italian, libretti, were, the, norm, even, when, a, german, composer, like, handel, found, himself, composing, the, likes, of, rinaldo, and, giulio, cesare, for, london, audiences, italian, libretti, remained, dominant, in, the, classical, period, as, well, for, example, in, the, operas, of, mozart, who, wrote, in, vienna, near, the, century, s, close, leading, italian, born, composers, of, opera, seria, include, alessandro, scarlatti, antonio, vivaldi, and, nicola, porpora, opera, seria, had, its, weaknesses, and, critics, the, taste, for, embellishment, on, behalf, of, the, superbly, trained, singers, and, the, use, of, spectacle, as, a, replacement, for, dramatic, purity, and, unity, drew, attacks, francesco, algarotti, s, essay, on, the, opera, 1755, proved, to, be, an, inspiration, for, christoph, willibald, gluck, s, reforms, he, advocated, that, opera, seria, had, to, return, to, basics, and, that, all, the, various, elements, music, both, instrumental, and, vocal, ballet, and, staging, must, be, subservient, to, the, overriding, drama, in, 1765, melchior, grimm, published, po, me, lyrique, an, influential, article, for, the, encyclop, die, on, lyric, and, opera, librettos, several, composers, of, the, period, including, niccol, jommelli, and, tommaso, traetta, attempted, to, put, these, ideals, into, practice, the, first, to, succeed, however, was, gluck, gluck, strove, to, achieve, a, beautiful, simplicity, this, is, evident, in, his, first, reform, opera, orfeo, ed, euridice, where, his, non, virtuosic, vocal, melodies, are, supported, by, simple, harmonies, and, a, richer, orchestra, presence, throughout, gluck, s, reforms, have, had, resonance, throughout, operatic, history, weber, mozart, and, wagner, in, particular, were, influenced, by, his, ideals, mozart, in, many, ways, gluck, s, successor, combined, a, superb, sense, of, drama, harmony, melody, and, counterpoint, to, write, a, series, of, comic, operas, with, libretti, by, lorenzo, da, ponte, notably, le, nozze, di, figaro, don, giovanni, and, cos, fan, tutte, which, remain, among, the, most, loved, popular, and, well, known, operas, but, mozart, s, contribution, to, opera, seria, was, more, mixed, by, his, time, it, was, dying, away, and, in, spite, of, such, fine, works, as, idomeneo, and, la, clemenza, di, tito, he, would, not, succeed, in, bringing, the, art, form, back, to, life, again, the, bel, canto, opera, movement, flourished, in, the, early, 19th, century, and, is, exemplified, by, the, operas, of, rossini, bellini, donizetti, pacini, mercadante, and, many, others, literally, beautiful, singing, bel, canto, opera, derives, from, the, italian, stylistic, singing, school, of, the, same, name, bel, canto, lines, are, typically, florid, and, intricate, requiring, supreme, agility, and, pitch, control, examples, of, famous, operas, in, the, bel, canto, style, include, rossini, s, il, barbiere, di, siviglia, and, la, cenerentola, as, well, as, bellini, s, norma, la, sonnambula, and, i, puritani, and, donizetti, s, lucia, di, lammermoor, l, elisir, d, amore, and, don, pasquale, following, the, bel, canto, era, a, more, direct, forceful, style, was, rapidly, popularized, by, giuseppe, verdi, beginning, with, his, biblical, opera, nabucco, this, opera, and, the, ones, that, would, follow, in, verdi, s, career, revolutionized, italian, opera, changing, it, from, merely, a, display, of, vocal, fireworks, with, rossini, s, and, donizetti, s, works, to, dramatic, story, telling, verdi, s, operas, resonated, with, the, growing, spirit, of, italian, nationalism, in, the, post, napoleonic, era, and, he, quickly, became, an, icon, of, the, patriotic, movement, for, a, unified, italy, in, the, early, 1850s, verdi, produced, his, three, most, popular, operas, rigoletto, il, trovatore, and, la, traviata, the, first, of, these, rigoletto, proved, the, most, daring, and, revolutionary, in, it, verdi, blurs, the, distinction, between, the, aria, and, recitative, as, it, never, before, was, leading, the, opera, to, be, an, unending, string, of, duets, la, traviata, was, also, novel, it, tells, the, story, of, courtesan, and, it, includes, elements, of, verismo, or, realistic, opera, because, rather, than, featuring, great, kings, and, figures, from, literature, it, focuses, on, the, tragedies, of, ordinary, life, and, society, after, these, he, continued, to, develop, his, style, composing, perhaps, the, greatest, french, grand, opera, don, carlos, and, ending, his, career, with, two, shakespeare, inspired, works, otello, and, falstaff, which, reveal, how, far, italian, opera, had, grown, in, sophistication, since, the, early, 19th, century, these, final, two, works, showed, verdi, at, his, most, masterfully, orchestrated, and, are, both, incredibly, influential, and, modern, in, falstaff, verdi, sets, the, pre, eminent, standard, for, the, form, and, style, that, would, dominate, opera, throughout, the, twentieth, century, rather, than, long, suspended, melodies, falstaff, contains, many, little, motifs, and, mottos, that, rather, than, being, expanded, upon, are, introduced, and, subsequently, dropped, only, to, be, brought, up, again, later, these, motifs, never, are, expanded, upon, and, just, as, the, audience, expects, a, character, to, launch, into, a, long, melody, a, new, character, speaks, introducing, a, new, phrase, this, fashion, of, opera, directed, opera, from, verdi, onward, exercising, tremendous, influence, on, his, successors, giacomo, puccini, richard, strauss, and, benjamin, britten, after, verdi, the, sentimental, realistic, melodrama, of, verismo, appeared, in, italy, this, was, a, style, introduced, by, pietro, mascagni, s, cavalleria, rusticana, and, ruggero, leoncavallo, s, pagliacci, that, came, to, dominate, the, world, s, opera, stages, with, such, popular, works, as, giacomo, puccini, s, la, boh, me, tosca, and, madama, butterfly, later, italian, composers, such, as, berio, and, nono, have, experimented, with, modernism, the, first, german, opera, was, dafne, composed, by, heinrich, sch, tz, in, 1627, but, the, music, score, has, not, survived, italian, opera, held, a, great, sway, over, german, speaking, countries, until, the, late, 18th, century, nevertheless, native, forms, would, develop, in, spite, of, this, influence, in, 1644, sigmund, staden, produced, the, first, singspiel, seelewig, a, popular, form, of, german, language, opera, in, which, singing, alternates, with, spoken, dialogue, in, the, late, 17th, century, and, early, 18th, century, the, theater, am, g, nsemarkt, in, hamburg, presented, german, operas, by, keiser, telemann, and, handel, yet, most, of, the, major, german, composers, of, the, time, including, handel, himself, as, well, as, graun, hasse, and, later, gluck, chose, to, write, most, of, their, operas, in, foreign, languages, especially, italian, in, contrast, to, italian, opera, which, was, generally, composed, for, the, aristocratic, class, german, opera, was, generally, composed, for, the, masses, and, tended, to, feature, simple, folk, like, melodies, and, it, was, not, until, the, arrival, of, mozart, that, german, opera, was, able, to, match, its, italian, counterpart, in, musical, sophistication, the, theatre, company, of, abel, seyler, pioneered, serious, german, language, opera, in, the, 1770s, marking, a, break, with, the, previous, simpler, musical, entertainment, mozart, s, singspiele, die, entf, hrung, aus, dem, serail, 1782, and, die, zauberfl, te, 1791, were, an, important, breakthrough, in, achieving, international, recognition, for, german, opera, the, tradition, was, developed, in, the, 19th, century, by, beethoven, with, his, fidelio, 1805, inspired, by, the, climate, of, the, french, revolution, carl, maria, von, weber, established, german, romantic, opera, in, opposition, to, the, dominance, of, italian, bel, canto, his, der, freisch, tz, 1821, shows, his, genius, for, creating, a, supernatural, atmosphere, other, opera, composers, of, the, time, include, marschner, schubert, and, lortzing, but, the, most, significant, figure, was, undoubtedly, wagner, wagner, was, one, of, the, most, revolutionary, and, controversial, composers, in, musical, history, starting, under, the, influence, of, weber, and, meyerbeer, he, gradually, evolved, a, new, concept, of, opera, as, a, gesamtkunstwerk, a, complete, work, of, art, a, fusion, of, music, poetry, and, painting, he, greatly, increased, the, role, and, power, of, the, orchestra, creating, scores, with, a, complex, web, of, leitmotifs, recurring, themes, often, associated, with, the, characters, and, concepts, of, the, drama, of, which, prototypes, can, be, heard, in, his, earlier, operas, such, as, der, fliegende, holl, nder, tannh, user, and, lohengrin, and, he, was, prepared, to, violate, accepted, musical, conventions, such, as, tonality, in, his, quest, for, greater, expressivity, in, his, mature, music, dramas, tristan, und, isolde, die, meistersinger, von, n, rnberg, der, ring, des, nibelungen, and, parsifal, he, abolished, the, distinction, between, aria, and, recitative, in, favour, of, a, seamless, flow, of, endless, melody, wagner, also, brought, a, new, philosophical, dimension, to, opera, in, his, works, which, were, usually, based, on, stories, from, germanic, or, arthurian, legend, finally, wagner, built, his, own, opera, house, at, bayreuth, with, part, of, the, patronage, from, ludwig, ii, of, bavaria, exclusively, dedicated, to, performing, his, own, works, in, the, style, he, wanted, opera, would, never, be, the, same, after, wagner, and, for, many, composers, his, legacy, proved, a, heavy, burden, on, the, other, hand, richard, strauss, accepted, wagnerian, ideas, but, took, them, in, wholly, new, directions, along, with, incorporating, the, new, form, introduced, by, verdi, he, first, won, fame, with, the, scandalous, salome, and, the, dark, tragedy, elektra, in, which, tonality, was, pushed, to, the, limits, then, strauss, changed, tack, in, his, greatest, success, der, rosenkavalier, where, mozart, and, viennese, waltzes, became, as, important, an, influence, as, wagner, strauss, continued, to, produce, a, highly, varied, body, of, operatic, works, often, with, libretti, by, the, poet, hugo, von, hofmannsthal, other, composers, who, made, individual, contributions, to, german, opera, in, the, early, 20th, century, include, alexander, von, zemlinsky, erich, korngold, franz, schreker, paul, hindemith, kurt, weill, and, the, italian, born, ferruccio, busoni, the, operatic, innovations, of, arnold, schoenberg, and, his, successors, are, discussed, in, the, section, on, modernism, during, the, late, 19th, century, the, austrian, composer, johann, strauss, ii, an, admirer, of, the, french, language, operettas, composed, by, jacques, offenbach, composed, several, german, language, operettas, the, most, famous, of, which, was, die, fledermaus, nevertheless, rather, than, copying, the, style, of, offenbach, the, operettas, of, strauss, ii, had, distinctly, viennese, flavor, to, them, in, rivalry, with, imported, italian, opera, productions, a, separate, french, tradition, was, founded, by, the, italian, born, french, composer, jean, baptiste, lully, at, the, court, of, king, louis, xiv, despite, his, foreign, birthplace, lully, established, an, academy, of, music, and, monopolised, french, opera, from, 1672, starting, with, cadmus, et, hermione, lully, and, his, librettist, quinault, created, trag, die, en, musique, a, form, in, which, dance, music, and, choral, writing, were, particularly, prominent, lully, s, operas, also, show, a, concern, for, expressive, recitative, which, matched, the, contours, of, the, french, language, in, the, 18th, century, lully, s, most, important, successor, was, jean, philippe, rameau, who, composed, five, trag, dies, en, musique, as, well, as, numerous, works, in, other, genres, such, as, op, ra, ballet, all, notable, for, their, rich, orchestration, and, harmonic, daring, despite, the, popularity, of, italian, opera, seria, throughout, much, of, europe, during, the, baroque, period, italian, opera, never, gained, much, of, a, foothold, in, france, where, its, own, national, operatic, tradition, was, more, popular, instead, after, rameau, s, death, the, bohemian, austrian, composer, gluck, was, persuaded, to, produce, six, operas, for, the, parisian, stage, in, the, 1770s, they, show, the, influence, of, rameau, but, simplified, and, with, greater, focus, on, the, drama, at, the, same, time, by, the, middle, of, the, 18th, century, another, genre, was, gaining, popularity, in, france, op, ra, comique, this, was, the, equivalent, of, the, german, singspiel, where, arias, alternated, with, spoken, dialogue, notable, examples, in, this, style, were, produced, by, monsigny, philidor, and, above, all, gr, try, during, the, revolutionary, and, napoleonic, period, composers, such, as, tienne, m, hul, luigi, cherubini, and, gaspare, spontini, who, were, followers, of, gluck, brought, a, new, seriousness, to, the, genre, which, had, never, been, wholly, comic, in, any, case, another, phenomenon, of, this, period, was, the, propaganda, opera, celebrating, revolutionary, successes, e, g, gossec, s, le, triomphe, de, la, r, publique, 1793, by, the, 1820s, gluckian, influence, in, france, had, given, way, to, a, taste, for, italian, bel, canto, especially, after, the, arrival, of, rossini, in, paris, rossini, s, guillaume, tell, helped, found, the, new, genre, of, grand, opera, a, form, whose, most, famous, exponent, was, another, foreigner, giacomo, meyerbeer, meyerbeer, s, works, such, as, les, huguenots, emphasised, virtuoso, singing, and, extraordinary, stage, effects,

french, tradition, many, french, critics, angrily, rejected, wagner, s, music, dramas, while, many, french, composers, closely, imitated, them, with, variable, success, perhaps, the, most, interesting, response, came, from, claude, debussy, as, in, wagner, s, works, the, orchestra, plays, a, leading, role, in, debussy, s, unique, opera, pell, as, et, m, lisande, 1902, and, there, are,

arranged, from, popular, tunes, in, this, respect, jigs, anticipate, the, ballad, operas, of, the, 18th, century, at, the, same, time, the, french, masque, was, gaining, a, firm, hold, at, the, english, court, with, even, more, lavish, splendour, and, highly, realistic, scenery, than, had, been, seen, before, inigo, jones, became, the, quintessential, designer, of, these, productions, and, this, style, was, to, dominate, the, english, stage, for, three, centuries, these, masques, contained, songs, and, dances, in, ben, jonson, s, lovers, made, men, 1617, the, whole, masque, was, sung, after, the, italian, manner, stilo, recitativo, the, approach, of, the, english, commonwealth, closed, theatres, and, halted, any, developments, that, may, have, led, to, the, establishment, of, english, opera, however, in, 1656, the, dramatist, sir, william, davenant, produced, the, siege, of, rhodes, since, his, theatre, was, not, licensed, to, produce, drama, he, asked, several, of, the, leading, composers, lawes, cooke, locke, coleman, and, hudson, to, set, sections, of, it, to, music, this, success, was, followed, by, the, cruelty, of, the, spaniards, in, peru, 1658, and, the, history, of, sir, francis, drake, 1659, these, pieces, were, encouraged, by, oliver, cromwell, because, they, were, critical, of, spain, with, the, english, restoration, foreign, especially, french,

and, adonis, often, thought, of, as, the, first, true, english, language, opera, blow, s, immediate, successor, was, the, better, known, henry, purcell, despite, the, success, of, his, masterwork, dido, and, aeneas, 1689, in, which, the, action, is, furthered, by, the, use, of, italian, style, recitative, much, of, purcell, s, best, work, was, not, involved, in, the, composing, of, typical, opera, but, instead, he, usually, worked, within, the, constraints, of, the, semi, opera, format, where, isolated, scenes, and, masques, are, contained, within, the, structure, of, a, spoken, play, such, as, shakespeare, in, purcell, s, the, fairy, queen, 1692, and, beaumont, and, fletcher, in, the, prophetess, 1690, and, bonduca, 1696, the, main, characters, of, the, play, tend, not, to, be, involved, in, the, musical, scenes, which, means, that, purcell, was, rarely, able, to, develop, his, characters, through, song, despite, these, hindrances, his, aim, and, that, of, his, collaborator, john, dryden, was, to, establish, serious, opera, in, england, but, these, hopes, ended, with, purcell, s, early, death, at, the, age, of, 36, following, purcell, the, popularity, of, opera, in, england, dwindled, for, several, decades, a, revived, interest, in, opera, occurred, in, the, 1730s, which, is, largely, attributed, to, thomas, arne, both, for, his, own, compositions, and, for, alerting, handel, to, the, commercial, possibilities, of, large, scale, works, in, english, arne, was, the, first, english, composer, to, experiment, with, italian, style, all, sung, comic, opera, with, his, greatest, success, being, thomas, and, sally, in, 1760, his, opera, artaxerxes, 1762, was, the, first, attempt, to, set, a, full, blown, opera, seria, in, english, and, was, a, huge, success, holding, the, stage, until, the, 1830s, although, arne, imitated, many, elements, of, italian, opera, he, was, perhaps, the, only, english, composer, at, that, time, who, was, able, to, move, beyond, the, italian, influences, and, create, his, own, unique, and, distinctly, english, voice, his, modernized, ballad, opera, love, in, a, village, 1762, began, a, vogue, for, pastiche, opera, that, lasted, well, into, the, 19th, century, charles, burney, wrote, that, arne, introduced, a, light, airy, original, and, pleasing, melody, wholly, different, from, that, of, purcell, or, handel, whom, all, english, composers, had, either, pillaged, or, imitated, besides, arne, the, other, dominating, force, in, english, opera, at, this, time, was, george, frideric, handel, whose, opera, serias, filled, the, london, operatic, stages, for, decades, and, influenced, most, home, grown, composers, like, john, frederick, lampe, who, wrote, using, italian, models, this, situation, continued, throughout, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, including, in, the, work, of, michael, william, balfe, and, the, operas, of, the, great, italian, composers, as, well, as, those, of, mozart, beethoven, and, meyerbeer, continued, to, dominate, the, musical, stage, in, england, the, only, exceptions, were, ballad, operas, such, as, john, gay, s, the, beggar, s, opera, 1728, musical, burlesques, european, operettas, and, late, victorian, era, light, operas, notably, the, savoy, operas, of, w, s, gilbert, and, arthur, sullivan, all, of, which, types, of, musical, entertainments, frequently, spoofed, operatic, conventions, these, genres, contributed, significantly, to, the, emergence, of, the, separate, but, closely, related, art, of, musical, theatre, in, the, late, 19th, century, sullivan, wrote, only, one, grand, opera, ivanhoe, following, the, efforts, of, a, number, of, young, english, composers, beginning, about, 1876, but, he, claimed, that, even, his, light, operas, constituted, part, of, a, school, of, english, opera, intended, to, supplant, the, french, operettas, usually, performed, in, bad, translations, that, had, dominated, the, london, stage, from, the, mid, 19th, century, into, the, 1870s, london, s, daily, telegraph, agreed, describing, the, yeomen, of, the, guard, as, a, genuine, english, opera, forerunner, of, many, others, let, us, hope, and, possibly, significant, of, an, advance, towards, a, national, lyric, stage, sullivan, produced, a, few, light, operas, in, the, 1890s, that, were, of, a, more, serious, nature, than, those, in, the, g, s, series, including, haddon, hall, and, the, beauty, stone, but, ivanhoe, which, ran, for, 155, consecutive, performances, using, alternating, casts, a, record, until, broadway, s, la, boh, me, survives, as, his, only, grand, opera, in, the, 20th, century, english, opera, began, to, assert, more, independence, with, works, of, ralph, vaughan, williams, and, in, particular, benjamin, britten, who, in, a, series, of, works, that, remain, in, standard, repertory, today, revealed, an, excellent, flair, for, the, dramatic, and, superb, musicality, more, recently, sir, harrison, birtwistle, has, emerged, as, one, of, britain, s, most, significant, contemporary, composers, from, his, first, opera, punch, and, judy, to, his, most, recent, critical, success, in, the, minotaur, in, the, first, decade, of, the, 21st, century, the, librettist, of, an, early, birtwistle, opera, michael, nyman, has, been, focusing, on, composing, operas, including, facing, goya, man, and, boy, dada, and, love, counts, today, composers, such, as, thomas, ad, s, continue, to, export, english, opera, abroad, also, in, the, 20th, century, american, composers, like, george, gershwin, porgy, and, bess, scott, joplin, treemonisha, leonard, bernstein, candide, gian, carlo, menotti, douglas, moore, and, carlisle, floyd, began, to, contribute, english, language, operas, infused, with, touches, of, popular, musical, styles, they, were, followed, by, composers, such, as, philip, glass, einstein, on, the, beach, mark, adamo, john, corigliano, the, ghosts, of, versailles, robert, moran, john, adams, nixon, in, china, andr, previn, and, jake, heggie, many, contemporary, 21st, century, opera, composers, have, emerged, such, as, missy, mazzoli, kevin, puts, tom, cipullo, huang, ruo, david, t, little, terence, blanchard, jennifer, higdon, tobias, picker, michael, ching, anthony, davis, and, ricky, ian, gordon, opera, was, brought, to, russia, in, the, 1730s, by, the, italian, operatic, troupes, and, soon, it, became, an, important, part, of, entertainment, for, the, russian, imperial, court, and, aristocracy, many, foreign, composers, such, as, baldassare, galuppi, giovanni, paisiello, giuseppe, sarti, and, domenico, cimarosa, as, well, as, various, others, were, invited, to, russia, to, compose, new, operas, mostly, in, the, italian, language, simultaneously, some, domestic, musicians, like, maxim, berezovsky, and, dmitry, bortniansky, were, sent, abroad, to, learn, to, write, operas, the, first, opera, written, in, russian, was, tsefal, i, prokris, by, the, italian, composer, francesco, araja, 1755, the, development, of, russian, language, opera, was, supported, by, the, russian, composers, vasily, pashkevich, yevstigney, fomin, and, alexey, verstovsky, however, the, real, birth, of, russian, opera, came, with, mikhail, glinka, and, his, two, great, operas, a, life, for, the, tsar, 1836, and, ruslan, and, lyudmila, 1842, after, him, during, the, 19th, century, in, russia, there, were, written, such, operatic, masterpieces, as, rusalka, and, the, stone, guest, by, alexander, dargomyzhsky, boris, godunov, and, khovanshchina, by, modest, mussorgsky, prince, igor, by, alexander, borodin, eugene, onegin, and, the, queen, of, spades, by, pyotr, tchaikovsky, and, the, snow, maiden, and, sadko, by, nikolai, rimsky, korsakov, these, developments, mirrored, the, growth, of, russian, nationalism, across, the, artistic, spectrum, as, part, of, the, more, general, slavophilism, movement, in, the, 20th, century, the, traditions, of, russian, opera, were, developed, by, many, composers, including, sergei, rachmaninoff, in, his, works, the, miserly, knight, and, francesca, da, rimini, igor, stravinsky, in, le, rossignol, mavra, oedipus, rex, and, the, rake, s, progress, sergei, prokofiev, in, the, gambler, the, love, for, three, oranges, the, fiery, angel, betrothal, in, a, monastery, and, war, and, peace, as, well, as, dmitri, shostakovich, in, the, nose, and, lady, macbeth, of, the, mtsensk, district, edison, denisov, in, l, cume, des, jours, and, alfred, schnittke, in, life, with, an, idiot, and, historia, von, d, johann, fausten, czech, composers, also, developed, a, thriving, national, opera, movement, of, their, own, in, the, 19th, century, starting, with, bed, ich, smetana, who, wrote, eight, operas, including, the, internationally, popular, the, bartered, bride, smetana, s, eight, operas, created, the, bedrock, of, the, czech, opera, repertory, but, of, these, only, the, bartered, bride, is, performed, regularly, outside, the, composer, s, homeland, after, reaching, vienna, in, 1892, and, london, in, 1895, it, rapidly, became, part, of, the, repertory, of, every, major, opera, company, worldwide, anton, n, dvo, k, s, nine, operas, except, his, first, have, librettos, in, czech, and, were, intended, to, convey, the, czech, national, spirit, as, were, some, of, his, choral, works, by, far, the, most, successful, of, the, operas, is, rusalka, which, contains, the, well, known, aria, m, s, ku, na, nebi, hlubok, m, song, to, the, moon, it, is, played, on, contemporary, opera, stages, frequently, outside, the, czech, republic, this, is, attributable, to, their, uneven, invention, and, libretti, and, perhaps, also, their, staging, requirements, the, jacobin, armida, vanda, and, dimitrij, need, stages, large, enough, to, portray, invading, armies, leo, jan, ek, gained, international, recognition, in, the, 20th, century, for, his, innovative, works, his, later, mature, works, incorporate, his, earlier, studies, of, national, folk, music, in, a, modern, highly, original, synthesis, first, evident, in, the, opera, jen, fa, which, was, premiered, in, 1904, in, brno, the, success, of, jen, fa, often, called, the, moravian, national, opera, at, prague, in, 1916, gave, jan, ek, access, to, the, world, s, great, opera, stages, jan, ek, s, later, works, are, his, most, celebrated, they, include, operas, such, as, k, a, kabanov, and, the, cunning, little, vixen, the, sinfonietta, and, the, glagolitic, mass, spain, also, produced, its, own, distinctive, form, of, opera, known, as, zarzuela, which, had, two, separate, flowerings, one, from, the, mid, 17th, century, through, the, mid, 18th, century, and, another, beginning, around, 1850, during, the, late, 18th, century, up, until, the, mid, 19th, century, italian, opera, was, immensely, popular, in, spain, supplanting, the, native, form, in, russian, eastern, europe, several, national, operas, began, to, emerge, ukrainian, opera, was, developed, by, semen, hulak, artemovsky, 1813, 1873, whose, most, famous, work, zaporozhets, za, dunayem, a, cossack, beyond, the, danube, is, regularly, performed, around, the, world, other, ukrainian, opera, composers, include, mykola, lysenko, taras, bulba, and, natalka, poltavka, heorhiy, maiboroda, and, yuliy, meitus, at, the, turn, of, the, century, a, distinct, national, opera, movement, also, began, to, emerge, in, georgia, under, the, leadership, zacharia, paliashvili, who, fused, local, folk, songs, and, stories, with, 19th, century, romantic, classical, themes, the, key, figure, of, hungarian, national, opera, in, the, 19th, century, was, ferenc, erkel, whose, works, mostly, dealt, with, historical, themes, among, his, most, often,

composed, by, an, ethnic, armenian, composer, tigran, chukhajian, in, 1868, and, partially, performed, in, 1873, it, was, fully, staged, in, 1945, in, armenia, the, first, years, of, the, soviet, union, saw, the, emergence, of, new, national, operas, such, as, the, koro, lu, 1937, by, the, azerbaijani, composer, uzeyir, hajibeyov, the, first, kyrgyz, opera, ai, churek, premiered, in, moscow,

classical, music, in, the, late, 19th, century, however, it, took, until, mid, 20th, century, for, iranian, composers, to, start, experiencing, with, the, field, especially, as, the, construction, of, the, roudaki, hall, in, 1967, made, possible, staging, of, a, large, variety, of, works, for, stage, perhaps, the, most, famous, iranian, opera, is, rostam, and, sohrab, by, loris, tjeknavorian,

had, operas, dating, back, to, the, white, haired, girl, in, 1945, in, latin, america, opera, started, as, a, result, of, european, colonisation, the, first, opera, ever, written, in, the, americas, was, 1701, s, la, p, rpura, de, la, rosa, by, tom, s, de, torrej, n, y, velasco, a, peruvian, composer, born, in, spain, a, decade, later, 1711, s, partenope, by, the, mexican, manuel, de, zumaya, was, the, first, opera, written, from, a, composer, born, in, latin, america, music, now, lost, the, first, brazilian, opera, for, a, libretto, in, portuguese, was, a, noite, de, s, o, jo, o, by, elias, lvares, lobo, however, ant, nio, carlos, gomes, is, generally, regarded, as, the, most, outstanding, brazilian, composer, having, a, relative, success, in, italy, with, its, brazilian, themed, operas, with, italian, librettos, such, as, il, guarany, opera, in, argentina, developed, in, the, 20th, century, after, the, inauguration, of, teatro, col, n, in, buenos, aires, with, the, opera, aurora, by, ettore, panizza, being, heavily, influenced, by, the, italian, tradition, due, to, immigration, other, important, composers, from, argentina, include, felipe, boero, and, alberto, ginastera, perhaps, the, most, obvious, stylistic, manifestation, of, modernism, in, opera, is, the, development, of, atonality, the, move, away, from, traditional, tonality, in, opera, had, begun, with, richard, wagner, and, in, particular, the, tristan, chord, composers, such, as, richard, strauss, claude, debussy, giacomo, puccini, paul, hindemith, benjamin, britten, and, hans, pfitzner, pushed, wagnerian, harmony, further, with, a, more, extreme, use, of, chromaticism, and, greater, use, of, dissonance, another, aspect, of, modernist, opera, is, the, shift, away, from, long, suspended, melodies, to, short, quick, mottos, as, first, illustrated, by, giuseppe, verdi, in, his, falstaff, composers, such, as, strauss, britten, shostakovich, and, stravinsky, adopted, and, expanded, upon, this, style, operatic, modernism, truly, began, in, the, operas, of, two, viennese, composers, arnold, schoenberg, and, his, student, alban, berg, both, composers, and, advocates, of, atonality, and, its, later, development, as, worked, out, by, schoenberg, dodecaphony, schoenberg, s, early, musico, dramatic, works, erwartung, 1909, premiered, in, 1924, and, die, gl, ckliche, hand, display, heavy, use, of, chromatic, harmony, and, dissonance, in, general, schoenberg, also, occasionally, used, sprechstimme, the, two, operas, of, schoenberg, s, pupil, alban, berg, wozzeck, 1925, and, lulu, incomplete, at, his, death, in, 1935, share, many, of, the, same, characteristics, as, described, above, though, berg, combined, his, highly, personal, interpretation, of, schoenberg, s, twelve, tone, technique, with, melodic, passages, of, a, more, traditionally, tonal, nature, quite, mahlerian, in, character, which, perhaps, partially, explains, why, his, operas, have, remained, in, standard, repertory, despite, their, controversial, music, and, plots, schoenberg, s, theories, have, influenced, either, directly, or, indirectly, significant, numbers, of, opera, composers, ever, since, even, if, they, themselves, did, not, compose, using, his, techniques, composers, thus, influenced, include, the, englishman, benjamin, britten, the, german, hans, werner, henze, and, the, russian, dmitri, shostakovich, philip, glass, also, makes, use, of, atonality, though, his, style, is, generally, described, as, minimalist, usually, thought, of, as, another, 20th, century, development, however, operatic, modernism, s, use, of, atonality, also, sparked, a, backlash, in, the, form, of, neoclassicism, an, early, leader, of, this, movement, was, ferruccio, busoni, who, in, 1913, wrote, the, libretto, for, his, neoclassical, number, opera, arlecchino, first, performed, in, 1917, also, among, the, vanguard, was, the, russian, igor, stravinsky, after, composing, music, for, the, diaghilev, produced, ballets, petrushka, 1911, and, the, rite, of, spring, 1913, stravinsky, turned, to, neoclassicism, a, development, culminating, in, his, opera, oratorio, oedipus, rex, 1927, stravinsky, had, already, turned, away, from, the, modernist, trends, of, his, early, ballets, to, produce, small, scale, works, that, do, not, fully, qualify, as, opera, yet, certainly, contain, many, operatic, elements, including, renard, 1916, a, burlesque, in, song, and, dance, and, the, soldier, s, tale, 1918, to, be, read, played, and, danced, in, both, cases, the, descriptions, and, instructions, are, those, of, the, composer, in, the, latter, the, actors, declaim, portions, of, speech, to, a, specified, rhythm, over, instrumental, accompaniment, peculiarly, similar, to, the, older, german, genre, of, melodrama, well, after, his, rimsky, korsakov, inspired, works, the, nightingale, 1914, and, mavra, 1922, stravinsky, continued, to, ignore, serialist, technique, and, eventually, wrote, a, full, fledged, 18th, century, style, diatonic, number, opera, the, rake, s, progress, 1951, his, resistance, to, serialism, an, attitude, he, reversed, following, schoenberg, s, death, proved, to, be, an, inspiration, for, many, other, composers, a, common, trend, throughout, the, 20th, century, in, both, opera, and, general, orchestral, repertoire, is, the, use, of, smaller, orchestras, as, a, cost, cutting, measure, the, grand, romantic, era, orchestras, with, huge, string, sections, multiple, harps, extra, horns, and, exotic, percussion, instruments, were, no, longer, feasible, as, government, and, private, patronage, of, the, arts, decreased, throughout, the, 20th, century, new, works, were, often, commissioned, and, performed, with, smaller, budgets, very, often, resulting, in, chamber, sized, works, and, short, one, act, operas, many, of, benjamin, britten, s, operas, are, scored, for, as, few, as, 13, instrumentalists, mark, adamo, s, two, act, realization, of, little, women, is, scored, for, 18, instrumentalists, another, feature, of, late, 20th, century, opera, is, the, emergence, of, contemporary, historical, operas, in, contrast, to, the, tradition,

audiences, for, classical, music, since, the, last, decades, of, the, 20th, century, efforts, resulted, in, lowering, the, average, age, of, the, met, s, audience, to, 58, in, 2018, the, average, age,

beholden, to, standard, repertory, are, not, reaching, younger, more, curious, audiences, smaller, companies, in, the, us, have, a, more, fragile, existence, and, they, usually, depend, on, a, patchwork, quilt, of, support, from, state, and, local, governments, local, businesses, and, fundraisers, nevertheless, some, smaller, companies, have, found, ways, of, drawing, new, audiences, in, addition, to, radio, and, television, broadcasts, of, opera, performances, which, have, had, some, success, in, gaining, new, audiences, broadcasts, of, live, performances, to, movie, theatres, have, shown, the, potential, to, reach, new, audiences, by, the, late, 1930s, some, musicals, began, to, be, written, with, a, more, operatic, structure, these, works, include, complex, polyphonic, ensembles, and, reflect, musical, developments, of, their, times, porgy, and, bess, 1935, influenced, by, jazz, styles, and, candide, 1956, with, its, sweeping, lyrical, passages, and, farcical, parodies, of, opera, both, opened, on, broadway, but, became, accepted, as, part, of, the, opera, repertory, popular, musicals, such, as, show, boat, west, side, story, brigadoon, sweeney, todd, passion, evita, the, light, in, the, piazza, the, phantom, of, the, opera, and, others, tell, dramatic, stories, through, complex, music, and, in, the, 2010s, they, are, sometimes, seen, in, opera, houses, the, most, happy, fella, 1952, is, quasi, operatic, and, has, been, revived, by, the, new, york, city, opera, other, rock, influenced, musicals, such, as, tommy, 1969, and, jesus, christ, superstar, 1971, les, mis, rables, 1980, rent, 1996, spring, awakening, 2006, and, natasha, pierre, the, great, comet, of, 1812, 2012, employ, various, operatic, conventions, such, as, through, composition, recitative, instead, of, dialogue, and, leitmotifs, a, subtle, type, of, sound, electronic, reinforcement, called, acoustic, enhancement, is, used, in, some, modern, concert, halls, and, theatres, where, operas, are, performed, although, none, of, the, major, opera, houses, use, traditional, broadway, style, sound, reinforcement, in, which, most, if, not, all, singers, are, equipped, with, radio, microphones, mixed, to, a, series, of, unsightly, loudspeakers, scattered, throughout, the, theatre, many, use, a, sound, reinforcement, system, for, acoustic, enhancement, and, for, subtle, boosting, of, offstage, voices, child, singers, onstage, dialogue, and, sound, effects, e, g, church, bells, in, tosca, or, thunder, effects, in, wagnerian, operas, operatic, vocal, technique, evolved, in, a, time, before, electronic, amplification, to, allow, singers, to, produce, enough, volume, to, be, heard, over, an, orchestra, without, the, instrumentalists, having, to, substantially, compromise, their, volume, singers, and, the, roles, they, play, are, classified, by, voice, type, based, on, the, tessitura, agility, power, and, timbre, of, their, voices, male, singers, can, be, classified, by, vocal, range, as, bass, bass, baritone, baritone, baritenor, tenor, and, countertenor, and, female, singers, as, contralto, mezzo, soprano, and, soprano, men, sometimes, sing, in, the, female, vocal, ranges, in, which, case, they, are, termed, sopranist, or, countertenor, the, countertenor, is, commonly, encountered, in, opera, sometimes, singing, parts, written, for, castrati, men, neutered, at, a, young, age, specifically, to, give, them, a, higher, singing, range, singers, are, then, further, classified, by, size, for, instance, a, soprano, can, be, described, as, a, lyric, soprano, coloratura, soubrette, spinto, or, dramatic, soprano, these, terms, although, not, fully, describing, a, singing, voice, associate, the, singer, s, voice, with, the, roles, most, suitable, to, the, singer, s, vocal, characteristics, yet, another, sub, classification, can, be, made, according, to, acting, skills, or, requirements, for, example, the, basso, buffo, who, often, must, be, a, specialist, in, patter, as, well, as, a, comic, actor, this, is, carried, out, in, detail, in, the, fach, system, of, german, speaking, countries, where, historically, opera, and, spoken, drama, were, often, put, on, by, the, same, repertory, company, a, particular, singer, s, voice, may, change, drastically, over, his, or, her, lifetime, rarely, reaching, vocal, maturity, until, the, third, decade, and, sometimes, not, until, middle, age, two, french, voice, types, premiere, dugazon, and, deuxieme, dugazon, were, named, after, successive, stages, in, the, career, of, louise, rosalie, lefebvre, mme, dugazon, other, terms, originating, in, the, star, casting, system, of, the, parisian, theatres, are, baryton, martin, and, soprano, falcon, the, soprano, voice, has, typically, been, used, as, the, voice, of, choice, for, the, female, protagonist, of, the, opera, since, the, latter, half, of, the, 18th, century, earlier, it, was, common, for, that, part, to, be, sung, by, any, female, voice, or, even, a, castrato, the, current, emphasis, on, a, wide, vocal, range, was, primarily, an, invention, of, the, classical, period, before, that, the, vocal, virtuosity, not, range, was, the, priority, with, soprano, parts, rarely, extending, above, a, high, a, handel, for, example, only, wrote, one, role, extending, to, a, high, c, though, the, castrato, farinelli, was, alleged, to, possess, a, top, d, his, lower, range, was, also, extraordinary, extending, to, tenor, c, the, mezzo, soprano, a, term, of, comparatively, recent, origin, also, has, a, large, repertoire, ranging, from, the, female, lead, in, purcell, s, dido, and, aeneas, to, such, heavyweight, roles, as, brang, ne, in, wagner, s, tristan, und, isolde, these, are, both, roles, sometimes, sung, by, sopranos, there, is, quite, a, lot, of, movement, between, these, two, voice, types, for, the, true, contralto, the, range, of, parts, is, more, limited, which, has, given, rise, to, the, insider, joke, that, contraltos, only, sing, witches, bitches, and, britches, roles, in, recent, years, many, of, the, trouser, roles, from, the, baroque, era, originally, written, for, women, and, those, originally, sung, by, castrati, have, been, reassigned, to, countertenors, the, tenor, voice, from, the, classical, era, onwards, has, traditionally, been, assigned, the, role, of, male, protagonist, many, of, the, most, challenging, tenor, roles, in, the, repertory, were, written, during, the, bel, canto, era, such, as, donizetti, s, sequence, of, 9, cs, above, middle, c, during, la, fille, du, r, giment, with, wagner, came, an, emphasis, on, vocal, heft, for, his, protagonist, roles, with, this, vocal, category, described, as, heldentenor, this, heroic, voice, had, its, more, italianate, counterpart, in, such, roles, as, calaf, in, puccini, s, turandot, basses, have, a, long, history, in, opera, having, been, used, in, opera, seria, in, supporting, roles, and, sometimes, for, comic, relief, as, well, as, providing, a, contrast, to, the, preponderance, of, high, voices, in, this, genre, the, bass, repertoire, is, wide, and, varied, stretching, from, the, comedy, of, leporello, in, don, giovanni, to, the, nobility, of, wotan, in, wagner, s, ring, cycle, to, the, conflicted, king, phillip, of, verdi, s, don, carlos, in, between, the, bass, and, the, tenor, is, the, baritone, which, also, varies, in, weight, from, say, guglielmo, in, mozart, s, cos, fan, tutte, to, posa, in, verdi, s, don, carlos, the, actual, designation, baritone, was, not, standard, until, the, mid, 19th, century, early, performances, of, opera, were, too, infrequent, for, singers, to, make, a, living, exclusively, from, the, style, but, with, the, birth, of, commercial, opera, in, the, mid, 17th, century, professional, performers, began, to, emerge, the, role, of, the, male, hero, was, usually, entrusted, to, a, castrato, and, by, the, 18th, century, when, italian, opera, was, performed, throughout, europe, leading, castrati, who, possessed, extraordinary, vocal, virtuosity, such, as, senesino, and, farinelli, became, international, stars, the, career, of, the, first, major, female, star, or, prima, donna, anna, renzi, dates, to, the, mid, 17th, century, in, the, 18th, century, a, number, of, italian, sopranos, gained, international, renown, and, often, engaged, in, fierce, rivalry, as, was, the, case, with, faustina, bordoni, and, francesca, cuzzoni, who, started, a, fistfight, with, one, another, during, a, performance, of, a, handel, opera, the, french, disliked, castrati, preferring, their, male, heroes, to, be, sung, by, an, haute, contre, a, high, tenor, of, which, joseph, legros, 1739, 1793, was, a, leading, example, though, opera, patronage, has, decreased, in, the, last, century, in, favor, of, other, arts, and, media, such, as, musicals, cinema, radio, television, and, recordings, mass, media, and, the, advent, of, recording, have, supported, the, popularity, of, many, famous, singers, including, anna, netrebko, maria, callas, enrico, caruso, amelita, galli, curci, kirsten, flagstad, mario, del, monaco, renata, tebaldi, ris, stevens, alfredo, kraus, franco, corelli, montserrat, caball, joan, sutherland, birgit, nilsson, nellie, melba, rosa, ponselle, beniamino, gigli, jussi, bj, rling, feodor, chaliapin, cecilia, bartoli,

the, 1700s, italian, operas, used, a, small, string, orchestra, but, it, rarely, played, to, accompany, the, singers, opera, solos, during, this, period, were, accompanied, by, the, basso, continuo, group, which, consisted, of, the, harpsichord, plucked, instruments, such, as, lute, and, a, bass, instrument, the, string, orchestra, typically, only, played, when, the, singer, was, not, singing, such, as, during, a, singer, s, entrances, and, exits, between, vocal, numbers, for, dancing, another, role, for, the, orchestra, during, this, period, was, playing, an, orchestral, ritornello, to, mark, the, end, of, a, singer, s, solo, during, the, early, 1700s, some, composers, began, to, use, the, string, orchestra, to, mark, certain, aria, or, recitatives, as, special, by, 1720, most, arias, were, accompanied, by, an, orchestra, opera, composers, such, as, domenico, sarro, leonardo, vinci, giambattista, pergolesi, leonardo, leo, and, johann, adolph, hasse, added, new, instruments, to, the, opera, orchestra, and, gave, the, instruments, new, roles, they, added, wind, instruments, to, the, strings, and, used, orchestral, instruments, to, play, instrumental, solos, as, a, way, to, mark, certain, arias, as, special, the, orchestra, has, also, provided, an, instrumental, overture, before, the, singers, come, onstage, since, the, 1600s, peri, s, euridice, opens, with, a, brief, instrumental, ritornello, and, monteverdi, s, l, orfeo, 1607, opens, with, a, toccata, in, this, case, a, fanfare, for, muted, trumpets, the, french, overture, as, found, in, jean, baptiste, lully, s, operas, consist, of, a, slow, introduction, in, a, marked, dotted, rhythm, followed, by, a, lively, movement, in, fugato, style, the, overture, was, frequently, followed, by, a, series, of, dance, tunes, before, the, curtain, rose, this, overture, style, was, also, used, in, english, opera, most, notably, in, henry, purcell, s, dido, and, aeneas, handel, also, uses, the, french, overture, form, in, some, of, his, italian, operas, such, as, giulio, cesare, in, italy, a, distinct, form, called, overture, arose, in, the, 1680s, and, became, established, particularly, through, the, operas, of, alessandro, scarlatti, and, spread, throughout, europe, supplanting, the, french, form, as, the, standard, operatic, overture, by, the, mid, 18th, century, it, uses, three, generally, homophonic, movements, fast, slow, fast, the, opening, movement, was, normally, in, duple, metre, and, in, a, major, key, the, slow, movement, in, earlier, examples, was, short, and, could, be, in, a, contrasting, key, the, concluding, movement, was, dance, like, most, often, with, rhythms, of, the, gigue, or, minuet, and, returned, to, the, key, of, the, opening, section, as, the, form, evolved, the, first, movement, may, incorporate, fanfare, like, elements, and, took, on, the, pattern, of, so, called, sonatina, form, sonata, form, without, a, development, section, and, the, slow, section, became, more, extended, and, lyrical, in, italian, opera, after, about, 1800, the, overture, became, known, as, the, sinfonia, fisher, also, notes, the, term, sinfonia, avanti, l, opera, literally, the, symphony, before, the, opera, was, an, early, term, for, a, sinfonia, used, to, begin, an, opera, that, is, as, an, overture, as, opposed, to, one, serving, to, begin, a, later, section, of, the, work, in, 19th, century, opera, in, some, operas, the, overture, vorspiel, einleitung, introduction, or, whatever, else, it, may, be, called, was, the, portion, of, the, music, which, takes, place, before, the, curtain, rises, a, specific, rigid, form, was, no, longer, required, for, the, overture, the, role, of, the, orchestra, in, accompanying, the, singers, changed, over, the, 19th, century, as, the, classical, style, transitioned, to, the, romantic, era, in, general, orchestras, got, bigger, new, instruments, were, added, such, as, additional, percussion, instruments, e, g, bass, drum, cymbals, snare, drum, etc, the, orchestration, of, orchestra, parts, also, developed, over, the, 19th, century, in, wagnerian, operas, the, forefronting, of, the, orchestra, went, beyond, the, overture, in, wagnerian, operas, such, as, the, ring, cycle, the, orchestra, often, played, the, recurrent, musical, themes, or, leitmotifs, a, role, which, gave, a, prominence, to, the, orchestra, which, elevated, its, status, to, that, of, a, prima, donna, wagner, s, operas, were, scored, with, unprecedented, scope, and, complexity, adding, more, brass, instruments, and, huge, ensemble, sizes, indeed, his, score, to, das, rheingold, calls, for, six, harps, in, wagner, and, the, work, of, subsequent, composers, such, as, benjamin, britten, the, orchestra, often, communicates, facts, about, the, story, that, exceed, the, levels, of, awareness, of, the, characters, therein, as, a, result, critics, began, to, regard, the, orchestra, as, performing, a, role, analogous, to, that, of, a, literary, narrator, as, the, role, of, the, orchestra, and, other, instrumental, ensembles, changed, over, the, history, of, opera, so, did, the, role, of, leading, the, musicians, in, the, baroque, era, the, musicians, were, usually, directed, by, the, harpsichord, player, although, the, french, composer, lully, is, known, to, have, conducted, with, a, long, staff, in, the, 1800s, during, the, classical, period, the, first, violinist, also, known, as, the, concertmaster, would, lead, the, orchestra, while, sitting, over, time, some, directors, began, to, stand, up, and, use, hand, and, arm, gestures, to, lead, the, performers, eventually, this, role, of, music, director, became, termed, the, conductor, and, a, podium, was, used, to, make, it, easier, for, all, the, musicians, to, see, him, or, her, by, the, time, wagnerian, operas, were, introduced, the, complexity, of, the, works, and, the, huge, orchestras, used, to, play, them, gave, the, conductor, an, increasingly, important, role, modern, opera, conductors, have, a, challenging, role, they, have, to, direct, both, the, orchestra, in, the, orchestra, pit, and, the, singers, on, stage, since, the, days, of, handel, and, mozart, many, composers, have, favored, italian, as, the, language, for, the, libretto, of, their, operas, from, the, bel, canto, era, to, verdi, composers, would, sometimes, supervise, versions, of, their, operas, in, both, italian, and, french, because, of, this, operas, such, as, lucia, di, lammermoor, or, don, carlos, are, today, deemed, canonical, in, both, their, french, and, italian, versions, until, the, mid, 1950s, it, was, acceptable, to, produce, operas, in, translations, even, if, these, had, not, been, authorized, by, the, composer, or, the, original, librettists, for, example, opera, houses, in, italy, routinely, staged, wagner, in, italian, after, world, war, ii, opera, scholarship, improved, artists, refocused, on, the, original, versions, and, translations, fell, out, of, favor, knowledge, of, european, languages, especially, italian, french, and, german, is, today, an, important, part, of, the, training, for, professional, singers, the, biggest, chunk, of, operatic, training, is, in, linguistics, and, musicianship, explains, mezzo, soprano, dolora, zajick, not, only, what, i, m, singing, but, what, everyone, else, is, singing, i, sing, italian, czech, russian, french, german, english, in, the, 1980s, supertitles, sometimes, called, surtitles, began, to, appear, although, supertitles, were, first, almost, universally, condemned, as, a, distraction, today, many, opera, houses, provide, either, supertitles, generally, projected, above, the, theatre, s, proscenium, arch, or, individual, seat, screens, where, spectators, can, choose, from, more, than, one, language, tv, broadcasts, typically, include, subtitles, even, if, intended, for, an, audience, who, knows, well, the, language, for, example, a, rai, broadcast, of, an, italian, opera, these, subtitles, target, not, only, the, hard, of, hearing, but, the, audience, generally, since, a, sung, discourse, is, much, harder, to, understand, than, a, spoken, one, even, in, the, ears, of, native, speakers, subtitles, in, one, or, more, languages, have, become, standard, in, opera, broadcasts, simulcasts, and, dvd, editions, today, operas, are, only, rarely, performed, in, translation, exceptions, include, the, english, national, opera, the, opera, theatre, of, saint, louis, opera, theater, of, pittsburgh, and, opera, south, east, which, favor, english, translations, another, exception, are, opera, productions, intended, for, a, young, audience, such, as, humperdinck, s, hansel, and, gretel, and, some, productions, of, mozart, s, the, magic, flute,

public, funding, to, opera, has, led, to, a, disparity, between, the, number, of, year, round, opera, houses, in, europe, and, the, united, states, for, example, germany, has, about, 80, year, round,
