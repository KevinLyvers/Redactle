continued, to, flower, and, develop, in, the, early, abbasid, era, the, arabic, ghazal, inherited, the, formal, verse, structure, of, the, qa, da, specifically, a, strict, adherence, to, meter, and, the, use, of, the, qafiya, a, common, end, rhyme, on, each, couplet, called, a, bayt, in, arabic, and, a, sher, in, persian, the, nature, of, the, ghazals, also, changed, to, meet, the, demands, of,

das, such, as, k, mil, bas, t, and, rajaz, topically, the, ghazal, focus, also, changed, from, nostalgic, reminiscences, of, the, homeland, and, loved, ones, towards, romantic, or, erotic, themes, these, included, sub, genres, with, themes, of, courtly, love, udhar, eroticism, hiss, homoeroticism, mudhakkar, and, as, a, highly, stylized, introduction, to, a, larger, poem, tamh, d, during, the, umayyad, and, early, abbasid, eras, the, ghazal, blossomed, it, inherited, the, structure, of, the, qa, da, focusing, on, meter, and, end, rhymes, with, time, it, adapted, for, musical, presentation, becoming, shorter, lighter, meters, were, preferred, and, themes, shifted, towards, romance, and, eroticism, with, the, spread, of, islam, the, arabian, ghazal, spread, both, westwards, into, africa, and, spain, as, well, as, eastwards, into, persia, the, popularity, of, ghazals, in, a, particular, region, was, usually, preceded, by, a, spread, of, the, arabic, language, in, that, country, in, medieval, spain, ghazals, written, in, hebrew, as, well, as, arabic, have, been, found, as, far, back, as, the, 11th, century, it, is, possible, that, ghazals, were, also, written, in, the, mozarabic, language, ghazals, in, the, arabic, form, have, also, been, written, in, a, number, of, major, west, african, literary, languages, like, hausa, and, fulfulde, however, the, most, significant, changes, to, the, ghazal, occurred, in, its, introduction, into, iran, in, the, 10th, century, the, early, persian, ghazals, largely, imitated, the, themes, and, form, of, the, arabian, ghazal, these, arabo, persian, ghazals, introduced, two, differences, compared, to, their, arabian, poetic, roots, firstly, the, persian, ghazals, did, not, employ, radical, enjambment, between, the, two, halves, of, the, couplet, and, secondly, the, persian, ghazals, formalized, the, use, of, the, common, rhyme, in, both, lines, of, the, opening, couplet, matla, the, imitation, of, arabian, forms, in, persia, extended, to, the, qa, da, which, was, also, popular, in, persia, because, of, its, comparative, brevity, thematic, variety, and, suggestive, richness, the, ghazal, soon, eclipsed, the, qa, da, and, became, the, most, popular, poetry, form, in, persia, much, like, arabian, ghazals, early, persian, ghazals, typically, employed, more, musical, meters, compared, to, other, persian, poetry, forms, rudaki, 858, 941, ce, is, considered, the, most, important, persian, ghazal, poet, of, this, period, and, the, founder, of, classical, persian, literature, the, persian, ghazal, evolved, into, its, own, distinctive, form, between, the, 12th, and, 13th, centuries, many, of, those, innovations, created, what, we, now, recognize, as, the, archetypical, ghazal, form, these, changes, occurred, in, two, periods, separated, by, the, mongol, invasion, of, persia, from, 1219, to, 1221, ad, the, early, persian, poetry, period, spanned, approximately, one, century, from, the, ghaznavid, era, which, lasted, until, 1187, till, a, little, after, the, mongol, invasion, apart, from, the, movement, towards, brevity, this, period, also, saw, two, significant, and, lasting, changes, to, the, ghazal, form, the, first, change, was, the, adoption, of, the, takhallus, the, practice, of, mentioning, the, poet, s, penname, in, the, final, couplet, called, the, maqta, the, adoption, of, the, takhallus, became, a, gradually, accepted, part, of, the, ghazal, form, and, by, the, time, of, saadi, shirazi, 1210, 1291, ad, the, most, important, ghazal, poet, of, this, period, it, had, become, de, rigueur, the, second, marked, change, from, arabian, ghazal, form, in, persian, ghazals, was, a, movement, towards, far, greater, autonomy, between, the, couplets, the, ghazal, later, spread, throughout, the, middle, east, and, south, asia, it, was, famous, all, around, the, indian, subcontinent, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, vin, bahs, b, sal, se, ye, ghass, le, miravad, and, with, the, three,

be, bang, le, miravad, that, this, persian, candy, that, to, bengal, goeth, jointly, penned, by, azam, shah, and, hafez, the, ghazal, was, spread, from, persia, into, indian, subcontinent, in, the, 12th, century, by, the, influence, of, sufi, mystics, and, the, courts, of, the, new, islamic, sultanates, this, period, coincided, with, the, early, islamic, sultanates, in, india, through, the, wave, of, islamic, invasions, into, the, region, in, that, period, the, 13th, century, chishti, sufi, poet, hasan, sijzi, is, regarded, as, the, originator, of, the, indo, persian, ghazal, sijzi, s, contemporary, the, poet, and, musician, ameer, khusrow, is, not, only, credited, as, the, first, urdu, poet, but, also, created, hindustani, as, we, know, today, by, merging, braj, khadhi, boli, hindi, urdu, persian, and, other, local, dialects, during, the, reign, of, the, sultan, of, bengal, ghiyasuddin, azam, shah, the, city, of, sonargaon, became, an, important, centre, of, persian, literature, with, many, publications, of, prose, and, poetry, the, period, is, described, as, the, golden, age, of, persian, literature, in, bengal, its, stature, is, illustrated, by, the, sultan, s, own, correspondence, with, the, persian, poet, hafez, when, the, sultan, invited, hafez, to, complete, an, incomplete, ghazal, by, the, ruler, the, renowned, poet, responded, by, acknowledging, the, grandeur, of, the, king, s, court, and, the, literary, quality, of, bengali, persian, poetry, it, is, said, that, atul, prasad, sen, pioneered, the, introduction, of, bengali, ghazals, residing, in, lucknow, he, was, inspired, by, persian, ghazals, and, experimented, with, a, stream, of, bengali, music, which, was, later, enriched, profusely, by, the, contribution, of, kazi, nazrul, islam, and, moniruddin, yusuf, the, ghazal, was, initially, composed, to, a, purely, religious, theme, now, in, this, era, ghazals, are, more, likely, to, have, romantic, themes, can, usually, be, interpreted, for, a, higher, being, or, for, a, mortal, beloved, love, is, always, viewed, as, something, that, will, complete, a, human, being, and, if, attained, will, lift, him, or, her, into, the, ranks, of, the, wise, or, will, bring, satisfaction, to, the, soul, of, the, poet, traditional, ghazal, law, may, or, may, not, have, an, explicit, element, of, sexual, desire, in, it, and, the, love, may, be, spiritual, the, love, may, be, directed, to, either, a, man, or, a, woman, the, ghazal, is, always, written, from, the, point, of, view, of, the, unrequited, lover, whose, beloved, is, portrayed, as, unattainable, most, often, either, the, beloved, has, not, returned, the, poet, s, love, or, returns, it, without, sincerity, or, else, the, societal, circumstances, do, not, allow, it, the, lover, is, aware, and, resigned, to, this, fate, but, continues, loving, nonetheless, the, lyrical, impetus, of, the, poem, derives, from, this, tension, representations, of, the, lover, s, powerlessness, to, resist, his, feelings, often, include, lyrically, exaggerated, violence, the, beloved, s, power, to, captivate, the, speaker, may, be, represented, in, extended, metaphors, about, the, arrows, of, his, eyes, or, by, referring, to, the, beloved, as, an, assassin, or, a, killer, take, for, example, the, following, couplets, from, amir, khusro, s, persian, ghazal, nemidanam, che, manzel, b, d,

was, a, nymph, like, beloved, with, cypress, like, form, and, tulip, like, face, ruthlessly, playing, havoc, with, the, hearts, of, the, lovers, many, of, the, major, historical, ghazal, poets, were, either, avowed, sufis, themselves, like, rumi, or, hafiz, or, were, sympathizers, with, sufi, ideas, somewhat, like, american, soul, music, but, with, melancholy, instead, of, funk, most, ghazals, can, be, viewed, in, a, spiritual, context, with, the, beloved, being, a, metaphor, for, god, or, the, poet, s, spiritual, master, it, is, the, intense, divine, love, of, sufism, that, serves, as, a, model, for, all, the, forms, of, love, found, in, ghazal, poetry, most, ghazal, scholars, today, recognize, that, some, ghazal, couplets, are, exclusively, about, divine, love, ishq, e, haqiqi, others, are, about, earthly, love, ishq, e, majazi, but, many, can, be, interpreted, in, either, context, traditionally, invoking, melancholy, love, longing, and, metaphysical, questions, ghazals, are, often, sung, by, afghan, pakistani, and, indian, musicians, the, form, has, roots, in, seventh, century, arabia, and, gained, prominence, in, the, thirteenth, and, fourteenth, centuries, thanks,
