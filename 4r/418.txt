tristan, und, isolde, tristan, and, isolde, wwv, 90, is, an, opera, in, three, acts, by, richard, wagner, to, a, german, libretto, by, the, composer, loosely, based, on, the, 12th, century, romance, tristan, and, iseult, by, gottfried, von, strassburg, it, was, composed, between, 1857, and, 1859, and, premiered, at, the, k, nigliches, hoftheater, und, nationaltheater, in, munich, on, 10, june, 1865, with, hans, von, b, low, conducting, wagner, referred, to, the, work, not, as, an, opera, but, called, it, eine, handlung, literally, a, drama, a, plot, or, an, action, wagner, s, composition, of, tristan, und, isolde, was, inspired, by, the, philosophy, of, arthur, schopenhauer, particularly, the, world, as, will, and, representation, as, well, as, by, wagner, s, relationship, with, his, muse, mathilde, wesendonck, spiritual, influences, are, also, noted, ranging, from, mysticism, to, hinduism, and, buddhism, widely, acknowledged, as, a, pinnacle, of, the, operatic, repertoire, tristan, was, notable, for, wagner, s, unprecedented, use, of, chromaticism, tonal, ambiguity, orchestral, colour, and, harmonic, suspension, the, opera, was, enormously, influential, among, western, classical, composers, and, provided, direct, inspiration, to, composers, such, as, anton, bruckner, gustav, mahler, richard, strauss, alban, berg, arnold, schoenberg, and, benjamin, britten, other, composers, such, as, claude, debussy, maurice, ravel, and, igor, stravinsky, formulated, their, styles, in, contrast, to, wagner, s, musical, legacy, many, see, tristan, as, a, milestone, on, the, move, away, from, common, practice, harmony, and, tonality, and, consider, that, it, lays, the, groundwork, for, the, direction, of, classical, music, in, the, 20th, century, both, wagner, s, libretto, style, and, music, were, also, profoundly, influential, on, the, symbolist, poets, of, the, late, 19th, century, and, early, 20th, century, wagner, was, forced, to, abandon, his, position, as, conductor, of, the, dresden, opera, in, 1849, as, there, was, a, warrant, posted, for, his, arrest, for, his, participation, in, the, unsuccessful, may, revolution, he, left, his, wife, minna, in, dresden, and, fled, to, z, rich, there, in, 1852, he, met, the, wealthy, silk, trader, otto, wesendonck, wesendonck, became, a, supporter, of, wagner, and, bankrolled, the, composer, for, several, years, wesendonck, s, wife, mathilde, became, enamoured, of, the, composer, though, wagner, was, working, on, his, epic, der, ring, des, nibelungen, he, found, himself, intrigued, by, the, legend, of, tristan, and, isolde, the, re, discovery, of, medieval, germanic, poetry, including, gottfried, von, strassburg, s, version, of, tristan, the, nibelungenlied, and, wolfram, von, eschenbach, s, parzival, left, a, large, impact, on, the, german, romantic, movements, during, the, mid, 19th, century, the, story, of, tristan, and, isolde, is, a, quintessential, romance, of, the, middle, ages, and, the, renaissance, several, versions, of, the, story, exist, the, earliest, dating, to, the, middle, of, the, 12th, century, gottfried, s, version, part, of, the, courtly, branch, of, the, legend, had, a, huge, influence, on, later, german, literature, according, to, his, autobiography, mein, leben, wagner, decided, to, dramatise, the, tristan, legend, after, his, friend, karl, ritter, attempted, to, do, so, writing, that, he, had, in, fact, made, a, point, of, giving, prominence, to, the, lighter, phases, of, the, romance, whereas, it, was, its, all, pervading, tragedy, that, impressed, me, so, deeply, that, i, felt, convinced, it, should, stand, out, in, bold, relief, regardless, of, minor, details, this, influence, together, with, his, discovery, of, the, philosophy, of, arthur, schopenhauer, in, october, 1854, led, wagner, to, find, himself, in, a, serious, mood, created, by, schopenhauer, which, was, trying, to, find, ecstatic, expression, it, was, some, such, mood, that, inspired, the, conception, of, a, tristan, und, isolde, wagner, wrote, of, his, preoccupations, with, schopenhauer, and, tristan, in, a, letter, to, franz, liszt, 16, december, 1854, never, in, my, life, having, enjoyed, the, true, happiness, of, love, i, shall, erect, a, memorial, to, this, loveliest, of, all, dreams, in, which, from, the, first, to, the, last, love, shall, for, once, find, utter, repletion, i, have, devised, in, my, mind, a, tristan, und, isolde, the, simplest, yet, most, full, blooded, musical, conception, imaginable, and, with, the, black, flag, that, waves, at, the, end, i, shall, cover, myself, over, to, die, by, the, end, of, 1854, wagner, had, sketched, out, all, three, acts, of, an, opera, on, the, tristan, theme, based, on, gottfried, von, strassburg, s, telling, of, the, story, while, the, earliest, extant, sketches, date, from, december, 1856, it, was, not, until, august, 1857, that, wagner, began, devoting, his, attention, entirely, to, the, opera, putting, aside, the, composition, of, siegfried, to, do, so, on, 20, august, he, began, the, prose, sketch, for, the, opera, and, the, libretto, or, poem, as, wagner, preferred, to, call, it, was, completed, by, 18, september, wagner, at, this, time, had, moved, into, a, cottage, built, in, the, grounds, of, wesendonck, s, villa, where, during, his, work, on, tristan, und, isolde, he, became, passionately, involved, with, mathilde, wesendonck, whether, or, not, this, relationship, was, platonic, remains, uncertain, one, evening, in, september, of, that, year, wagner, read, the, finished, poem, of, tristan, to, an, audience, including, his, wife, minna, his, current, muse, mathilde, and, his, future, mistress, and, later, wife, cosima, von, b, low, by, october, 1857, wagner, had, begun, the, composition, sketch, of, the, first, act, during, november, however, he, set, five, of, mathilde, s, poems, to, music, known, today, as, the, wesendonck, lieder, this, was, an, unusual, move, by, wagner, who, almost, never, set, to, music, poetic, texts, other, than, his, own, wagner, described, two, of, the, songs, im, treibhaus, and, tr, ume, as, studies, for, tristan, und, isolde, tr, ume, uses, a, motif, that, forms, the, love, duet, in, act, ii, of, tristan, while, im, treibhaus, introduces, a, theme, that, later, became, the, prelude, to, act, iii, but, wagner, resolved, to, write, tristan, only, after, he, had, secured, a, publishing, deal, with, the, leipzig, based, firm, breitkopf, h, rtel, in, january, 1858, from, this, point, on, wagner, finished, each, act, and, sent, it, off, for, engraving, before, he, started, on, the, next, a, remarkable, feat, given, the, unprecedented, length, and, complexity, of, the, score, in, april, 1858, wagner, s, wife, minna, intercepted, a, note, from, wagner, to, mathilde, and, despite, wagner, s, protests, that, she, was, putting, a, vulgar, interpretation, on, the, note, she, accused, first, wagner, and, then, mathilde, of, unfaithfulness, after, enduring, much, misery, wagner, persuaded, minna, who, had, a, heart, condition, to, rest, at, a, spa, while, otto, wesendonck, took, mathilde, to, italy, it, was, during, the, absence, of, the, two, women, that, wagner, began, the, composition, sketch, of, the, second, act, of, tristan, however, minna, s, return, in, july, 1858, did, not, clear, the, air, and, on, 17, august, wagner, was, forced, to, leave, both, minna, and, mathilde, and, move, to, venice, wagner, would, later, describe, his, last, days, in, zurich, as, a, veritable, hell, minna, wrote, to, mathilde, before, departing, for, dresden, i, must, tell, you, with, a, bleeding, heart, that, you, have, succeeded, in, separating, my, husband, from, me, after, nearly, twenty, two, years, of, marriage, may, this, noble, deed, contribute, to, your, peace, of, mind, to, your, happiness, wagner, finished, the, second, act, of, tristan, during, his, eight, month, exile, in, venice, where, he, lived, in, the, palazzo, giustinian, in, march, 1859, fearing, extradition, to, saxony, where, he, was, still, considered, a, fugitive, wagner, moved, to, lucerne, where, he, composed, the, last, act, completing, it, in, august, 1859, tristan, und, isolde, proved, to, be, a, difficult, opera, to, stage, and, wagner, considered, various, possibilities, for, the, venue, in, 1857, he, was, invited, by, a, representative, of, pedro, ii, emperor, of, brazil, to, stage, his, operas, in, rio, de, janeiro, in, italian, the, language, of, the, imperial, opera, he, told, liszt, he, was, considering, settling, in, rio, and, that, that, city, would, be, given, the, honour, of, premiering, tristan, wagner, sent, the, emperor, bound, copies, of, his, earlier, operas, in, expression, of, his, interest, but, nothing, more, came, of, the, plan, he, then, proposed, that, the, premiere, take, place, in, strasbourg, following, interest, in, the, project, shown, by, the, grand, duchess, of, baden, again, the, project, failed, to, eventuate, his, thoughts, then, turned, to, paris, the, centre, of, the, operatic, world, in, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, however, after, a, disastrous, staging, of, tannh, user, at, the, paris, op, ra, wagner, offered, the, work, to, the, karlsruhe, opera, in, 1861, when, wagner, visited, the, vienna, court, opera, to, rehearse, possible, singers, for, this, production, the, management, at, vienna, suggested, staging, the, opera, there, originally, the, tenor, alois, ander, was, employed, to, sing, the, part, of, tristan, but, later, proved, incapable, of, learning, the, role, parallel, attempts, to, stage, the, opera, in, dresden, weimar, and, prague, failed, despite, over, 70, rehearsals, between, 1862, and, 1864, tristan, und, isolde, was, unable, to, be, staged, in, vienna, winning, the, opera, a, reputation, as, unperformable, it, was, only, after, king, ludwig, ii, of, bavaria, became, a, sponsor, of, wagner, he, granted, the, composer, a, generous, stipend, and, supported, wagner, s, artistic, endeavours, in, other, ways, that, enough, resources, could, be, found, to, mount, the, premiere, of, tristan, und, isolde, hans, von, b, low, was, chosen, to, conduct, the, production, at, the, nationaltheater, in, munich, despite, the, fact, that, wagner, was, having, an, affair, with, his, wife, cosima, von, b, low, even, then, the, planned, premiere, on, 15, may, 1865, had, to, be, postponed, until, the, isolde, malvina, schnorr, von, carolsfeld, had, recovered, from, hoarseness, the, work, finally, premiered, on, 10, june, 1865, with, malvina, s, husband, ludwig, partnering, her, as, tristan, on, 21, july, 1865, having, sung, the, role, only, four, times, ludwig, died, suddenly, prompting, speculation, that, the, exertion, involved, in, singing, the, part, of, tristan, had, killed, him, the, stress, of, performing, tristan, has, also, claimed, the, lives, of, conductors, felix, mottl, in, 1911, and, joseph, keilberth, in, 1968, both, men, died, after, collapsing, while, conducting, the, second, act, of, the, opera, malvina, sank, into, a, deep, depression, over, her, husband, s, death, and, never, sang, again, although, she, lived, for, another, 38, years, for, some, years, thereafter, the, only, performers, of, the, roles, were, another, husband, wife, team, heinrich, vogl, and, therese, vogl, the, next, production, of, tristan, was, in, weimar, in, 1874, wagner, himself, supervised, another, production, of, tristan, in, berlin, in, march, 1876, but, the, opera, was, only, performed, in, his, own, theatre, at, the, bayreuth, festival, after, his, death, cosima, wagner, his, widow, oversaw, this, in, 1886, a, production, that, was, widely, acclaimed, the, first, production, outside, of, germany, was, given, at, the, theatre, royal, drury, lane, london, in, 1882, tristan, was, performed, by, hermann, winkelmann, who, later, that, year, sang, the, title, role, of, parsifal, at, bayreuth, it, was, conducted, by, hans, richter, who, also, conducted, the, first, covent, garden, production, two, years, later, winkelmann, was, also, the, first, vienna, tristan, in, 1883, the, first, american, performance, was, held, at, the, metropolitan, opera, in, december, 1886, conducted, by, anton, seidl, the, score, of, tristan, und, isolde, has, often, been, cited, as, a, landmark, in, the, development, of, western, music, throughout, the, opera, wagner, uses, a, remarkable, range, of, orchestral, colour, harmony, and, polyphony, doing, so, with, a, freedom, rarely, found, in, his, earlier, operas, the, first, chord, in, the, piece, the, tristan, chord, is, of, great, significance, in, the, move, away, from, traditional, tonal, harmony, as, it, resolves, to, another, dissonant, chord, the, opera, is, noted, for, its, numerous, expansions, of, harmonic, practice, for, instance, one, significant, innovation, is, the, frequent, use, of, two, consecutive, chords, containing, tritones, diminished, fifth, or, augmented, fourth, neither, of, which, is, a, diminished, seventh, chord, f, b, bar, 2, e, a, bar, 3, tristan, und, isolde, is, also, notable, for, its, use, of, harmonic, suspension, a, device, used, by, a, composer, to, create, musical, tension, by, exposing, the, listener, to, a, series, of, prolonged, unfinished, cadences, thereby, inspiring, a, desire, and, expectation, on, the, part, of, the, listener, for, musical, resolution, while, suspension, is, a, common, compositional, device, in, use, since, before, the, renaissance, wagner, was, one, of, the, first, composers, to, employ, harmonic, suspension, over, the, course, of, an, entire, work, the, cadences, first, introduced, in, the, prelude, are, not, resolved, until, the, finale, of, act, iii, and, on, a, number, of, occasions, throughout, the, opera, wagner, primes, the, audience, for, a, musical, climax, with, a, series, of, chords, building, in, tension, only, to, deliberately, defer, the, anticipated, resolution, one, particular, example, of, this, technique, occurs, at, the, end, of, the, love, duet, in, act, ii, wie, sie, fassen, wie, sie, lassen, where, tristan, and, isolde, gradually, build, up, to, a, musical, climax, only, to, have, the, expected, resolution, destroyed, by, the, dissonant, interruption, of, kurwenal, rette, dich, tristan, resolution, of, the, music, does, not, occur, until, the, very, end, of, the, opera, after, isolde, sings, the, closing, excerpt, commonly, referred, to, as, the, liebestod, love, death, after, which, she, sinks, down, as, if, transfigured, dead, onto, tristan, s, body, the, tonality, of, tristan, was, to, prove, immensely, influential, in, western, classical, music, wagner, s, use, of, musical, colour, also, influenced, the, development, of, film, music, bernard, herrmann, s, score, for, alfred, hitchcock, s, classic, vertigo, is, heavily, reminiscent, of, the, liebestod, most, evidently, in, the, resurrection, scene, the, liebestod, was, incorporated, in, luis, bu, uel, s, surrealist, film, l, age, d, or, not, all, composers, however, reacted, favourably, claude, debussy, s, piano,

to, isolde, to, relate, these, events, and, isolde, in, what, is, termed, the, narrative, and, curse, sadly, tells, her, of, how, following, the, death, of, morold, she, happened, upon, a, stranger, who, called, himself, tantris, tantris, was, found, mortally, wounded, in, a, barge, von, einem, kahn, der, klein, und, arm, and, isolde, used, her, healing, powers, to, restore, him, to, health, she, discovered, during, tantris, recovery, however, that, he, was, actually, tristan, the, murderer, of, her, fianc, isolde, attempted, to, kill, the, man, with, his, own, sword, as, he, lay, helpless, before, her, however, tristan, looked, not, at, the, sword, that, would, kill, him, or, the, hand, that, wielded, the, sword, but, into, her, eyes, er, sah, mir, in, die, augen, his, gaze, pierced, her, heart, and, she, was, unable, to, slay, him, tristan, was, allowed, to, leave, with, the, promise, never, to, come, back, but, he, later, returned, with, the, intention, of, marrying, isolde, to, his, uncle, king, marke, isolde, furious, at, tristan, s, betrayal, insists, that, he, drink, atonement, to, her, and, from, her, medicine, chest, produces, a, vial, to, make, the, drink, brang, ne,

reproaches, him, about, his, conduct, and, tells, him, that, he, owes, her, his, life, and, how, his, actions, have, undermined, her, honour, since, she, blessed, morold, s, weapons, before, battle, and, therefore, she, swore, revenge, tristan, first, offers, his, sword, but, isolde, refuses, they, must, drink, atonement, brang, ne, brings, in, the, potion, that, will, seal, their, pardon,

as, will, and, representation, by, german, philosopher, arthur, schopenhauer, in, 1854, profoundly, impacted, wagner, and, triggered, in, him, a, spiritual, and, artistic, reassessment, schopenhauer, s, pessimistic, worldview, his, emphasis, on, the, primacy, of, will, as, the, fundamental, force, of, existence, and, his, notion, that, music, is, the, highest, of, the, arts, because, it, directly, expresses, the, will, resonated, deeply, with, wagner, in, response, wagner, composed, works, such, as, tristan, and, isolde, and, parsifal, whose, libretti, are, pervaded, with, schopenhauer, s, ideas, and, whose, music, dominates, the, opera, this, is, in, contrast, to, wagner, s, earlier, theorizing, in, the, artwork, of, the, future, 1849, that, music, poetry, and, drama, should, be, balanced, and, serve, as, equal, partners, in, the, gesamtkunstwerk, wagner, gives, heightened, importance, to, music, in, tristan, und, isolde, often, regarded, as, his, most, symphonically, rich, work, unlike, his, other, operas, wagner, wrote, some, music, material, for, tristan, prior, to, completing, the, libretto, the, music, itself, embodies, schopenhauer, s, concept, of, the, will, a, force, that, is, inherently, restless, and, never, fully, satisfied, that, drives, all, human, urges, and, desires, leading, to, a, cycle, of, longing, and, suffering, wagner, captures, this, in, the, musical, structure, of, the, opera, through, his, use, of, unresolved, harmonic, tension, and, extreme, chromaticism, creating, a, sense, of, perpetual, yearning, and, lack, of, resolution, only, at, the, very, end, of, the, opera, when, isolde, undergoes, transfiguration, and, love, death, does, the, musical, tension, finally, resolve, the, passion, of, the, music, is, often, referred, to, as, being, sensual, and, erotic, this, not, only, reflects, the, desires, of, the, illicit, lovers, but, is, consistent, with, schopenhauer, s, position, that, the, sexual, urge, is, the, most, powerful, manifestation, of, the, will, wagner, uses, the, metaphors, of, day, and, night, in, the, second, act, to, designate, the, realms, inhabited, by, tristan, and, isolde, the, day, represents, the, external, world, of, social, obligations, duties, and, constraints, embodied, by, king, marke, s, court, where, tristan, and, isolde, must, suppress, their, love, and, live, according, to, the, norms, and, expectations, of, society, this, is, a, world, of, falsehood, and, deception, because, it, requires, them, to, deny, their, true, feelings, the, night, by, contrast, represents, the, inner, world, of, truth, love, and, authentic, existence, where, tristan, and, isolde, can, express, their, love, freely, and, fully, it, is, a, realm, where, the, constraints, of, the, external, world, are, suspended, and, their, deepest, desires, can, be, realized, however, this, realm, is, also, linked, to, death, as, true, fulfillment, and, unity, can, only, be, achieved, beyond, the, physical, world, schopenhauer, s, philosophy, distinguishes, between, the, world, as, phenomenon, the, world, of, appearances, shaped, by, our, perceptions, and, intellect, and, the, noumenon, which, refers, to, the, underlying, reality, that, is, not, directly, accessible, to, us, but, is, the, true, essence, of, existence, wagner, implicitly, equates, the, realm, of, day, with, schopenhauer, s, concept, of, phenomenon, and, the, realm, of, night, with, the, concept, of, noumenon, in, the, years, leading, up, to, 1857, when, wagner, would, set, aside, his, work, on, the, ring, to, instead, focus, on, tristan, und, isolde, wagner, s, interests, were, dominated, by, spiritual, matters, in, 1855, his, attention, turned, to, indian, religion, reading, eug, ne, burnouf, s, introduction, to, the, history, of, indian, buddhism, and, hindu, texts, published, in, adolf, holtzmann, s, indian, sagas, in, addition, to, tristan, this, culminated, in, the, conception, of, two, additional, operas, at, this, time, die, sieger, based, on, the, life, of, the, buddhist, monk, nanda, and, parsifal, a, holy, grail, quest, based, on, the, medieval, poem, parzival, by, wolfram, von, eschenbach, wagner, was, interested, in, the, orient, and, already, acquainted, with, islamic, mysticism, prior, to, reading, schopenhauer, in, 1854, having, written, to, his, friend, august, r, ckel, in, september, 1852, declaring, the, persian, sufi, poet, hafez, to, be, the, greatest, of, all, poets, schopenhauer, s, discussion, of, german, christian, mystics, such, as, meister, eckhart, further, piqued, wagner, s, interest, in, mysticism, when, tristan, and, isolde, willingly, drink, the, potion, at, the, end, of, act, i, but, do, not, die, their, eyes, are, opened, to, the, illusions, of, material, day, and, to, the, higher, spiritual, insight, of, night, tristan, celebrates, the, enlightenment, brought, about, by, the, potion, in, act, ii, oh, hail, the, potion, hail, to, the, draft, hail, to,

the, material, world, connoting, a, magic, show, an, illusion, where, things, appear, to, be, present, but, are, not, what, they, seem, and, conceals, the, true, character, of, spiritual, reality, it, finds, its, parallel, in, schopenhauer, s, phenomenon, tristan, denounces, the, lying, disguise, of, day, and, resolves, to, yearn, for, and, seek, out, only, the, holy, night, oh, now, we, are, with, night, anointed, the, treacherous, day, with, envy, pointed, could, part, us, with, its, disguise, but, no, longer, cheat, us, with, lies, amid, the, day, s, deluded, churning, remains, one, single,

liebesnacht, o, sink, hernieder, nacht, der, liebe, begins, here, tristan, and, isolde, dedicate, themselves, to, eternal, night, and, wish, that, day, would, never, come, again, instead, dying, a, transcendental, love, death, together, as, the, ultimate, consummation, of, their, love, the, music, builds, to, ecstatic, mystically, elated, climaxes, where, they, imagine, the, dissolution, of,

character, s, relentless, pursuit, of, an, idealized, love, that, transcends, earthly, bounds, and, the, notion, of, love, leading, to, a, metaphysical, union, can, be, seen, as, parallel, to, the,

state, of, bliss, is, associated, with, the, buddhist, concept, of, nirvana, although, schopenhauer, and, wagner, at, the, time, misunderstood, this, concept, to, imply, a, state, of, non, being, in, the, unbounded, swell, in, the, resounding, call, in, the, world, s, breath, flowing, in, all, to, drown, to, sink, unconscious, supreme, bliss, wagner, scholar, john, pohanka, has, written, on, the, spiritual, influences, in, wagner, s, works, commenting, that, they, not, only, contribute, material, to, the, libretto, but, how, the, power, of, the, wagnerian, music, and, drama, can, itself, invoke, a, transformative, ineffable, experience, in, some, audience, members, comparable, to, a, mystical, experience, given, the, influence, of, schopenhauer, and, the, apparent, framing, of, tristan, und, isolde, as, a, tragedy, many, have, remarked, on, the, opera, s, pessimism, on, this, british, scholar, george, ainslie, hight, wrote, in, 1912, such, is, wagner, s, pessimism, it, is, the, pessimism, of, the, ved, nta, philosophy, that, is, to, say, it, is, most, clearly, formulated, in, that, system, and, in, the, upanishads, upon, which, it, rests, but, really, it, is, the, common, basis, of, all, religions, it, breathes, in, the, poems, of, hafiz, in, the, philosophy, of, parmenides, plato, and, the, stoics, in, the, profound, wisdom, of, ecclesiastes, in, mediaeval, mysticism, and, the, faith, of, the, early, christian, church, buddhism, and, christianity, are, both, pessimist, in, their, origin, although, tristan, und, isolde, is, now, widely, performed, in, major, opera, houses, around, the, world, critical, opinion, of, the, opera, was, initially, unfavourable, the, 5, july, 1865, edition, of, the, allgemeine, musikalische, zeitung, reported, not, to, mince, words, it, is, the, glorification, of, sensual, pleasure, tricked, out, with, every, titillating, device, it, is, unremitting, materialism, according, to, which, human, beings, have, no, higher, destiny, than, after, living, the, life, of, turtle, doves, to, vanish, in, sweet, odours, like, a, breath, in, the, service, of, this, end, music, has, been, enslaved, to, the, word, the, most, ideal, of, the, muses, has, been, made, to, grind, the, colours, for, indecent, paintings, wagner, makes, sensuality, itself, the, true, subject, of, his, drama, we, think, that, the, stage, presentation, of, the, poem, tristan, und, isolde, amounts, to, an, act, of, indecency, wagner, does, not, show, us, the, life, of, heroes, of, nordic, sagas, which, would, edify, and, strengthen, the, spirit, of, his, german, audiences, what, he, does, present, is, the, ruination, of, the, life, of, heroes, through, sensuality, eduard, hanslick, s, reaction, in, 1868, to, the, prelude, to, tristan, was, that, it, reminds, one, of, the, old, italian, painting, of, a, martyr, whose, intestines, are, slowly, unwound, from, his, body, on, a, reel, the, first, performance, in, london, s, drury, lane, theatre, drew, the, following, response, from, the, era, in, 1882, we, cannot, refrain, from, making, a, protest, against, the, worship, of, animal, passion, which, is, so, striking, a, feature, in, the, late, works, of, wagner, we, grant, there, is, nothing, so, repulsive, in, tristan, as, in, die, walk, re, but, the, system, is, the, same, the, passion, is, unholy, in, itself, and, its, representation, is, impure, and, for, those, reasons, we, rejoice, in, believing, that, such, works, will, not, become, popular, if, they, did, we, are, certain, their, tendency, would, be, mischievous, and, there, is, therefore, some, cause, for, congratulation, in, the, fact, that, wagner, s, music, in, spite, of, all, its, wondrous, skill, and, power, repels, a, greater, number, than, it, fascinates, mark, twain, on, a, visit, to, germany, heard, tristan, at, bayreuth, and, commented, i, know, of, some, and, have, heard, of, many, who, could, not, sleep, after, it, but, cried, the, night, away, i, feel, strongly, out, of, place, here, sometimes, i, feel, like, the, one, sane, person, in, the, community, of, the, mad, sometimes, i, feel, like, the, one, blind, man, where, all, others, see, the, one, groping, savage, in, the, college, of, the, learned, and, always, during, service, i, feel, like, a, heretic, in, heaven, clara, schumann, wrote, that, tristan, und, isolde, was, the, most, repugnant, thing, i, have, ever, seen, or, heard, in, all, my, life, with, the, passage, of, time, tristan, became, more, favourably, regarded, in, an, interview, shortly, before, his, death, giuseppe, verdi, said, that, he, stood, in, wonder, and, terror, before, wagner, s, tristan, in, the, perfect, wagnerite, the, writer, and, satirist, george, bernard, shaw, writes, that, tristan, was, an, astonishingly, intense, and, faithful, translation, into, music, of, the, emotions, which, accompany, the, union, of, a, pair, of, lovers, and, described, it, as, a, poem, of, destruction, and, death, richard, strauss, initially, dismissive, of, tristan, claimed, that, wagner, s, music, would, kill, a, cat, and, would, turn, rocks, into, scrambled, eggs, from, fear, of, hideous, discords, later, however, strauss, became, part, of, the, bayreuth, coterie, and, writing, to, cosima, wagner, in, 1892, declared, i, have, conducted, my, first, tristan, it, was, the, most, wonderful, day, of, my, life, in, 1935, he, wrote, to, joseph, gregor, one, of, his, librettists, that, tristan, und, isolde, was, the, end, of, all, romanticism, as, it, brings, into, focus, the, longing, of, the, entire, 19th, century, the, conductor, bruno, walter, heard, his, first, tristan, und, isolde, in, 1889, as, a, student, so, there, i, sat, in, the, topmost, gallery, of, the, berlin, opera, house, and, from, the, first, sound, of, the, cellos, my, heart, contracted, spasmodically, never, before, has, my, soul, been, deluged, with, such, floods, of, sound, and, passion, never, had, my, heart, been, consumed, by, such, yearning, and, sublime, bliss, a, new, epoch, had, begun, wagner, was, my, god, and, i, wanted, to, become, his, prophet, arnold, schoenberg, referred, to, wagner, s, technique, of, shifting, chords, in, tristan, as, phenomena, of, incredible, adaptability, and, nonindependence, roaming, homeless, among, the, spheres, of, keys, spies, reconnoitering, weaknesses, to, exploit, them, in, order, to, create, confusion, deserters, for, whom, surrender, of, their, own, personality, is, an, end, in, itself, friedrich, nietzsche, who, in, his, younger, years, was, one, of, wagner, s, staunchest, allies, wrote, that, for, him, tristan, and, isolde, is, the, real, opus, metaphysicum, of, all, art, insatiable, and, sweet, craving, for, the, secrets, of, night, and, death, it, is, overpowering, in, its, simple, grandeur, in, a, letter, to, his, friend, erwin, rohde, in, october, 1868, nietzsche, described, his, reaction, to, tristan, s, prelude, i, simply, cannot, bring, myself, to, remain, critically, aloof, from, this, music, every, nerve, in, me, is, atwitch, and, it, has, been, a, long, time, since, i, had, such, a, lasting, sense, of, ecstasy, as, with, this, overture, even, after, his, break, with, wagner, nietzsche, continued, to, consider, tristan, a, masterpiece, even, now, i, am, still, in, search, of, a, work, which, exercises, such, a, dangerous, fascination, such, a, spine, tingling, and, blissful, infinity, as, tristan, i, have, sought, in, vain, in, every, art, marcel, proust, greatly, influenced, by, wagner, refers, to, tristan, und, isolde, and, its, inexhaustible, repetitions, throughout, his, novel, in, search, of, lost, time, he, describes, the, prelude, theme, as, linked, to, the, future, to, the, reality, of, the, human, soul, of, which, it, was, one, of, the, most, special, and, distinctive, ornaments, tristan, und, isolde, has, a, long, recorded, history, and, most, of, the, major, wagner, conductors, since, the, end, of, the, first, world, war, have, had, their, interpretations, captured, on, disc, the, limitations, of, recording, technology, meant, that, until, the, 1930s, it, was, difficult, to, record, the, entire, opera, however, recordings, of, excerpts, or, single, acts, exist, going, back, to, 1901, when, excerpts, of, tristan, were, captured, on, the, mapleson, cylinders, recorded, during, performances, at, the, metropolitan, opera, in, the, years, before, world, war, ii, kirsten, flagstad, and, lauritz, melchior, were, considered, to, be, the, prime, interpreters, of, the, lead, roles, and, mono, recordings, exist, of, this, pair, in, a, number, of, live, performances, led, by, conductors, such, as, thomas, beecham, fritz, reiner, artur, bodanzky, and, erich,

noted, for, its, strong, vivid, characterizations, and, is, now, available, as, a, live, recording, in, the, 1960s, the, soprano, birgit, nilsson, was, considered, the, major, isolde, interpreter, and, she, was, often, partnered, with, the, tristan, of, wolfgang, windgassen, their, performance, at, bayreuth, in, 1966, under, the, baton, of, karl, b, hm, was, captured, by, deutsche, grammophon,

helga, dernesch, as, isolde, paired, with, an, extremely, intense, jon, vickers, and, the, unusual, balance, between, orchestra, and, singers, favoured, by, karajan, was, controversial, in, the, 1980s, recordings, by, conductors, such, as, carlos, kleiber, reginald, goodall, and, leonard, bernstein, were, mostly, considered, to, be, important, for, the, interpretation, of, the, conductor, rather, than, that, of, the, lead, performers, the, set, by, kleiber, is, notable, as, isolde, was, sung, by, the, famous, mozartian, soprano, margaret, price, who, never, sang, the, role, of, isolde,

from, tristan, und, isolde, from, 1999, its, composition, was, inspired, by, a, lecture, given, by, the, wagner, biographer, and, chair, of, the, wagner, society, of, scotland, derek, watson, to,
