pop, art, is, an, art, movement, that, emerged, in, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, during, the, mid, to, late, 1950s, the, movement, presented, a, challenge, to, traditions, of, fine, art, by, including, imagery, from, popular, and, mass, culture, such, as, advertising, comic, books, and, mundane, mass, produced, objects, one, of, its, aims, is, to, use, images, of, popular, culture, in, art, emphasizing, the, banal, or, kitschy, elements, of, any, culture, most, often, through, the, use, of, irony, it, is, also, associated, with, the, artists, use, of, mechanical, means, of, reproduction, or, rendering, techniques, in, pop, art, material, is, sometimes, visually, removed, from, its, known, context, isolated, or, combined, with, unrelated, material, amongst, the, early, artists, that, shaped, the, pop, art, movement, were, eduardo, paolozzi, and, richard, hamilton, in, britain, and, larry, rivers, ray, johnson, robert, rauschenberg, and, jasper, johns, among, others, in, the, united, states, pop, art, is, widely, interpreted, as, a, reaction, to, the, then, dominant, ideas, of, abstract, expressionism, as, well, as, an, expansion, of, those, ideas, due, to, its, utilization, of, found, objects, and, images, it, is, similar, to, dada, pop, art, and, minimalism, are, considered, to, be, art, movements, that, precede, postmodern, art, or, are, some, of, the, earliest, examples, of, postmodern, art, themselves, pop, art, often, takes, imagery, that, is, currently, in, use, in, advertising, product, labeling, and, logos, figure, prominently, in, the, imagery, chosen, by, pop, artists, seen, in, the, labels, of, campbell, s, soup, cans, by, andy, warhol, even, the, labeling, on, the, outside, of, a, shipping, box, containing, food, items, for, retail, has, been, used, as, subject, matter, in, pop, art, as, demonstrated, by, warhol, s, campbell, s, tomato, juice, box, 1964, pictured, the, origins, of, pop, art, in, north, america, developed, differently, from, those, in, great, britain, in, the, united, states, pop, art, was, a, response, by, artists, it, marked, a, return, to, hard, edged, composition, and, representational, art, they, used, impersonal, mundane, reality, irony, and, parody, to, defuse, the, personal, symbolism, and, painterly, looseness, of, abstract, expressionism, in, the, u, s, some, artwork, by, larry, rivers, alex, katz, and, man, ray, anticipated, pop, art, by, contrast, the, origins, of, pop, art, in, post, war, britain, while, employing, irony, and, parody, were, more, academic, britain, focused, on, the, dynamic, and, paradoxical, imagery, of, american, pop, culture, as, powerful, manipulative, symbolic, devices, that, were, affecting, whole, patterns, of, life, while, simultaneously, improving, the, prosperity, of, a, society, early, pop, art, in, britain, was, a, matter, of, ideas, fueled, by, american, popular, culture, when, viewed, from, afar, similarly, pop, art, was, both, an, extension, and, a, repudiation, of, dadaism, while, pop, art, and, dadaism, explored, some, of, the, same, subjects, pop, art, replaced, the, destructive, satirical, and, anarchic, impulses, of, the, dada, movement, with, a, detached, affirmation, of, the, artifacts, of, mass, culture, among, those, artists, in, europe, seen, as, producing, work, leading, up, to, pop, art, are, pablo, picasso, marcel, duchamp, and, kurt, schwitters, although, both, british, and, american, pop, art, began, during, the, 1950s, marcel, duchamp, and, others, in, europe, like, francis, picabia, and, man, ray, predate, the, movement, in, addition, there, were, some, earlier, american, proto, pop, origins, which, utilized, as, found, cultural, objects, during, the, 1920s, american, artists, patrick, henry, bruce, gerald, murphy, charles, demuth, and, stuart, davis, created, paintings, that, contained, pop, culture, imagery, mundane, objects, culled, from, american, commercial, products, and, advertising, design, almost, prefiguring, the, pop, art, movement, the, independent, group, ig, founded, in, london, in, 1952, is, regarded, as, the, precursor, to, the, pop, art, movement, they, were, a, gathering, of, young, painters, sculptors, architects, writers, and, critics, who, were, challenging, prevailing, modernist, approaches, to, culture, as, well, as, traditional, views, of, fine, art, their, group, discussions, centered, on, pop, culture, implications, from, elements, such, as, mass, advertising, movies, product, design, comic, strips, science, fiction, and, technology, at, the, first, independent, group, meeting, in, 1952, co, founding, member, artist, and, sculptor, eduardo, paolozzi, presented, a, lecture, using, a, series, of, collages, titled, bunk, that, he, had, assembled, during, his, time, in, paris, between, 1947, and, 1949, this, material, of, found, objects, such, as, advertising, comic, book, characters, magazine, covers, and, various, mass, produced, graphics, mostly, represented, american, popular, culture, one, of, the, collages, in, that, presentation, was, paolozzi, s, i, was, a, rich, man, s, plaything, 1947, which, includes, the, first, use, of, the, word, pop, appearing, in, a, cloud, of, smoke, emerging, from, a, revolver, following, paolozzi, s, seminal, presentation, in, 1952, the, ig, focused, primarily, on, the, imagery, of, american, popular, culture, particularly, mass, advertising, according, to, the, son, of, john, mchale, the, term, pop, art, was, first, coined, by, his, father, in, 1954, in, conversation, with, frank, cordell, although, other, sources, credit, its, origin, to, british, critic, lawrence, alloway, both, versions, agree, that, the, term, was, used, in, independent, group, discussions, by, mid, 1955, pop, art, as, a, moniker, was, then, used, in, discussions, by, ig, members, in, the, second, session, of, the, ig, in, 1955, and, the, specific, term, pop, art, first, appeared, in, published, print, in, the, article, but, today, we, collect, ads, by, ig, members, alison, and, peter, smithson, in, ark, magazine, in, 1956, however, the, term, is, often, credited, to, british, art, critic, curator, lawrence, alloway, for, his, 1958, essay, titled, the, arts, and, the, mass, media, even, though, the, precise, language, he, uses, is, popular, mass, culture, furthermore, what, i, meant, by, it, then, is, not, what, it, means, now, i, used, the, term, and, also, pop, culture, to, refer, to, the, products, of, the, mass, media, not, to, works, of, art, that, draw, upon, popular, culture, in, any, case, sometime, between, the, winter, of, 1954, 55, and, 1957, the, phrase, acquired, currency, in, conversation, nevertheless, alloway, was, one, of, the, leading, critics, to, defend, the, inclusion, of, the, imagery, of, mass, culture, in, the, fine, arts, alloway, clarified, these, terms, in, 1966, at, which, time, pop, art, had, already, transited, from, art, schools, and, small, galleries, to, a, major, force, in, the, artworld, but, its, success, had, not, been, in, england, practically, simultaneously, and, independently, new, york, city, had, become, the, hotbed, for, pop, art, in, london, the, annual, royal, society, of, british, artists, rba, exhibition, of, young, talent, in, 1960, first, showed, american, pop, influences, in, january, 1961, the, most, famous, rba, young, contemporaries, of, all, put, david, hockney, the, american, r, b, kitaj, new, zealander, billy, apple, allen, jones, derek, boshier, joe, tilson, patrick, caulfield, peter, phillips, pauline, boty, and, peter, blake, on, the, map, apple, designed, the, posters, and, invitations, for, both, the, 1961, and, 1962, young, contemporaries, exhibitions, hockney, kitaj, and, blake, went, on, to, win, prizes, at, the, john, moores, exhibition, in, liverpool, in, the, same, year, apple, and, hockney, traveled, together, to, new, york, during, the, royal, college, s, 1961, summer, break, which, is, when, apple, first, made, contact, with, andy, warhol, both, later, moved, to, the, united, states, and, apple, became, involved, with, the, new, york, pop, art, scene, although, pop, art, began, in, the, early, 1950s, in, america, it, was, given, its, greatest, impetus, during, the, 1960s, the, term, pop, art, was, officially, introduced, in, december, 1962, the, occasion, was, a, symposium, on, pop, art, organized, by, the, museum, of, modern, art, by, this, time, american, advertising, had, adopted, many, elements, of, modern, art, and, functioned, at, a, very, sophisticated, level, consequently, american, artists, had, to, search, deeper, for, dramatic, styles, that, would, distance, art, from, the, well, designed, and, clever, commercial, materials, as, the, british, viewed, american, popular, culture, imagery, from, a, somewhat, removed, perspective, their, views, were, often, instilled, with, romantic, sentimental, and, humorous, overtones, by, contrast, american, artists, bombarded, every, day, with, the, diversity, of, mass, produced, imagery, produced, work, that, was, generally, more, bold, and, aggressive, according, to, historian, curator, and, critic, henry, geldzahler, ray, johnson, s, collages, elvis, presley, no, 1, and, james, dean, stand, as, the, plymouth, rock, of, the, pop, movement, author, lucy, lippard, wrote, that, the, elvis, and, marilyn, monroe, heralded, warholian, pop, johnson, worked, as, a, graphic, designer, met, andy, warhol, by, 1956, and, both, designed, several, book, covers, for, new, directions, and, other, publishers, johnson, began, mailing, out, whimsical, flyers, advertising, his, design, services, printed, via, offset, lithography, he, later, became, known, as, the, father, of, mail, art, as, the, founder, of, his, new, york, correspondence, school, working, small, by, stuffing, clippings, and, drawings, into, envelopes, rather, than, working, larger, like, his, contemporaries, a, note, about, the, cover, image, in, january, 1958, s, art, news, pointed, out, that, johns, first, one, man, show, places, him, with, such, better, known, colleagues, as, rauschenberg, twombly, kaprow, and, ray, johnson, indeed, two, other, important, artists, in, the, establishment, of, america, s, pop, art, vocabulary, were, the, painters, jasper, johns, and, robert, rauschenberg, rauschenberg, who, like, ray, johnson, attended, black, mountain, college, in, north, carolina, after, world, war, ii, was, influenced, by, the, earlier, work, of, kurt, schwitters, and, other, dada, artists, and, his, belief, that, painting, relates, to, both, art, and, life, challenged, the, dominant, modernist, perspective, of, his, time, his, use, of, discarded, readymade, objects, in, his, combines, and, pop, culture, imagery, in, his, silkscreen, paintings, connected, his, works, to, topical, events, in, everyday, america, the, silkscreen, paintings, of, 1962, 64, combined, expressive, brushwork, with, silkscreened, magazine, clippings, from, life, newsweek, and, national, geographic, johns, paintings, of, flags, targets, numbers, and, maps, of, the, u, s, as, well, three, dimensional, depictions, of, ale, cans, drew, attention, to, questions, of, representation, in, art, johns, and, rauschenberg, s, work, of, the, 1950s, is, frequently, referred, to, as, neo, dada, and, is, visually, distinct, from, the, prototypical, american, pop, art, which, exploded, in, the, early, 1960s, roy, lichtenstein, is, of, equal, importance, to, american, pop, art, his, work, and, its, use, of, parody, probably, defines, the, basic, premise, of, pop, art, better, than, any, other, selecting, the, old, fashioned, comic, strip, as, subject, matter, lichtenstein, produces, a, hard, edged, precise, composition, that, documents, while, also, parodying, in, a, soft, manner, lichtenstein, used, oil, and, magna, paint, in, his, best, known, works, such, as, drowning, girl, 1963, which, was, appropriated, from, the, lead, story, in, dc, comics, secret, hearts, 83, drowning, girl, is, part, of, the, collection, of, the, museum, of, modern, art, his, work, features, thick, outlines, bold, colors, and, ben, day, dots, to, represent, certain, colors, as, if, created, by, photographic, reproduction, lichtenstein, said, put, things, down, on, the, canvas, and, responded, to, what, they, had, done, to, the, color, positions, and, sizes, my, style, looks, completely, different, but, the, nature, of, putting, down, lines, pretty, much, is, the, same, mine, just, don, t, come, out, looking, calligraphic, like, pollock, s, or, kline, s, pop, art, merges, popular, and, mass, culture, with, fine, art, while, injecting, humor, irony, and, recognizable, imagery, content, into, the, mix, the, paintings, of, lichtenstein, like, those, of, andy, warhol, tom, wesselmann, and, others, share, a, direct, attachment, to, the, commonplace, image, of, american, popular, culture, but, also, treat, the, subject, in, an, impersonal, manner, clearly, illustrating, the, idealization, of, mass, production, andy, warhol, is, probably, the, most, famous, figure, in, pop, art, in, fact, art, critic, arthur, danto, once, called, warhol, the, nearest, thing, to, a, philosophical, genius, the, history, of, art, has, produced, warhol, attempted, to, take, pop, beyond, an, artistic, style, to, a, life, style, and, his, work, often, displays, a, lack, of, human, affectation, that, dispenses, with, the, irony, and, parody, of, many, of, his, peers, claes, oldenburg, jim, dine, and, tom, wesselmann, had, their, first, shows, in, the, judson, gallery, in, 1959, and, 1960, and, later, in, 1960, through, 1964, along, with, james, rosenquist, george, segal, and, others,

france, new, realism, was, along, with, fluxus, and, other, groups, one, of, the, numerous, tendencies, of, the, avant, garde, in, the, 1960s, the, group, initially, chose, nice, on, the, french, riviera, as, its, home, base, since, klein, and, arman, both, originated, there, new, realism, is, thus, often, retrospectively, considered, by, historians, to, be, an, early, representative, of, the, cole, de, nice, movement, in, spite, of, the, diversity, of, their, plastic, language, they, perceived, a, common, basis, for, their, work, this, being, a, method, of, direct, appropriation, of, reality, equivalent, in, the, terms, used, by, restany, to, a, poetic, recycling, of, urban, industrial, and, advertising, reality, in, spain, the, study, of, pop, art, is, associated, with, the, new, figurative, which, arose, from, the, roots, of, the, crisis, of, informalism, eduardo, arroyo, could, be, said, to, fit, within, the, pop, art, trend, on, account, of, his, interest, in, the, environment, his, critique, of, our, media, culture, which, incorporates, icons, of, both, mass, media, communication, and, the, history, of, painting, and, his, scorn, for, nearly, all, established, artistic, styles, however, the, spanish, artist, who, could, be, considered, most, authentically, part, of, pop, art, is, alfredo, alca, n, because, of, the, use, he, makes, of, popular, images, and, empty, spaces, in, his, compositions, also, in, the, category, of, spanish, pop, art, is, the, chronicle, team, el, equipo, cr, nica, which, existed, in, valencia, between, 1964, and, 1981, formed, by, the, artists, manolo, vald, s, and, rafael, solbes, their, movement, can, be, characterized, as, pop, because, of, its, use, of, comics, and, publicity, images, and, its, simplification, of, images, and, photographic, compositions, filmmaker, pedro, almod, var, emerged, from, madrid, s, la, movida, subculture, of, the, 1970s, making, low, budget, super, 8, pop, art, movies, and, he, was, subsequently, called, the, andy, warhol, of, spain, by, the, media, at, the, time, in, the, book, almodovar, on, almodovar, he, is, quoted, as, saying, that, the, 1950s, film, funny, face, was, a, central, inspiration, for, his, work, one, pop, trademark, in, almodovar, s, films, is, that, he, always, produces, a, fake, commercial, to, be, inserted, into, a, scene, in, new, zealand, pop, art, has, predominately, flourished, since, the, 1990s, and, is, often, connected, to, kiwiana, kiwiana, is, a, pop, centered, idealised, representation, of, classically, kiwi, icons, such, as, meat, pies, kiwifruit, tractors, jandals, four, square, supermarkets, the, inherent, campness, of, this, is, often, subverted, to, signify, cultural, messages, dick, frizzell, is, a, famous, new, zealand, pop, artist, known, for, using, older, kiwiana, symbols, in, ways, that, parody, modern, culture, for, example, frizzell, enjoys, imitating, the, work, of, foreign, artists, giving, their, works, a, unique, new, zealand, view, or, influence, this, is, done, to, show, new, zealand, s, historically, subdued, impact, on, the, world, naive, art, is, connected, to, aotearoan, pop, art, this, way,

pop, art, originated, in, 1950s, culture, the, works, of, the, artists, enrico, baj, and, mimmo, rotella, to, be, precise, rightly, considered, the, forerunners, of, this, scene, in, fact, it, was, around, 1958, 1959, that, baj, and, rotella, abandoned, their, previous, careers, which, might, be, generically, defined, as, belonging, to, a, non, representational, genre, despite, being,

even, in, this, case, the, prototypes, can, be, traced, back, to, the, works, of, rotella, and, baj, both, far, from, neutral, in, their, relationship, with, society, yet, this, is, not, an, exclusive, element, there, is, a, long, line, of, artists, including, gianni, ruffi, roberto, barni, silvio, pasotti, umberto, bignardi, and, claudio, cintoli, who, take, on, reality, as, a, toy, as,
