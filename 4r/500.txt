expressionism, is, a, modernist, movement, initially, in, poetry, and, painting, originating, in, northern, europe, around, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, its, typical, trait, is, to, present, the, world, solely, from, a, subjective, perspective, distorting, it, radically, for, emotional, effect, in, order, to, evoke, moods, or, ideas, expressionist, artists, have, sought, to, express, the, meaning, of, emotional, experience, rather, than, physical, reality, expressionism, developed, as, an, avant, garde, style, before, the, first, world, war, it, remained, popular, during, the, weimar, republic, particularly, in, berlin, the, style, extended, to, a, wide, range, of, the, arts, including, expressionist, architecture, painting, literature, theatre, dance, film, and, music, paris, became, a, gathering, place, for, a, group, of, expressionist, artists, many, of, jewish, origin, dubbed, the, school, of, paris, after, world, war, ii, figurative, expressionism, influenced, artists, and, styles, around, the, world, the, term, is, sometimes, suggestive, of, angst, in, a, historical, sense, much, older, painters, such, as, matthias, gr, newald, and, el, greco, are, sometimes, termed, expressionist, though, the, term, is, applied, mainly, to, 20th, century, works, the, expressionist, emphasis, on, individual, and, subjective, perspective, has, been, characterized, as, a, reaction, to, positivism, and, other, artistic, styles, such, as, naturalism, and, impressionism, while, the, word, expressionist, was, used, in, the, modern, sense, as, early, as, 1850, its, origin, is, sometimes, traced, to, paintings, exhibited, in, 1901, in, paris, by, obscure, artist, julien, auguste, herv, which, he, called, expressionismes, an, alternative, view, is, that, the, term, was, coined, by, the, czech, art, historian, antonin, mat, j, ek, in, 1910, as, the, opposite, of, impressionism, an, expressionist, wishes, above, all, to, express, himself, an, expressionist, rejects, immediate, perception, and, builds, on, more, complex, psychic, structures, impressions, and, mental, images, that, pass, through, people, s, soul, as, through, a, filter, which, rids, them, of, all, substantial, accretions, to, produce, their, clear, essence, are, assimilated, and, condensed, into, more, general, forms, into, types, which, he, transcribes, through, simple, short, hand, formulae, and, symbols, important, precursors, of, expressionism, were, the, german, philosopher, friedrich, nietzsche, 1844, 1900, especially, his, philosophical, novel, thus, spoke, zarathustra, 1883, 1892, the, later, plays, of, the, swedish, dramatist, august, strindberg, 1849, 1912, including, the, trilogy, to, damascus, 1898, 1901, a, dream, play, 1902, the, ghost, sonata, 1907, frank, wedekind, 1864, 1918, especially, the, lulu, plays, erdgeist, earth, spirit, 1895, and, die, b, chse, der, pandora, pandora, s, box, 1904, the, american, poet, walt, whitman, s, 1819, 1892, leaves, of, grass, 1855, 1891, the, russian, novelist, fyodor, dostoevsky, 1821, 1881, norwegian, painter, edvard, munch, 1863, 1944, dutch, painter, vincent, van, gogh, 1853, 1890, belgian, painter, james, ensor, 1860, 1949, and, pioneering, austrian, psychoanalyst, sigmund, freud, 1856, 1939, in, 1905, a, group, of, four, german, artists, led, by, ernst, ludwig, kirchner, formed, die, br, cke, the, bridge, in, the, city, of, dresden, this, was, arguably, the, founding, organization, for, the, german, expressionist, movement, though, they, did, not, use, the, word, itself, a, few, years, later, in, 1911, a, like, minded, group, of, young, artists, formed, der, blaue, reiter, the, blue, rider, in, munich, the, name, came, from, wassily, kandinsky, s, der, blaue, reiter, painting, of, 1903, among, their, members, were, kandinsky, franz, marc, paul, klee, and, august, macke, however, the, term, expressionism, did, not, firmly, establish, itself, until, 1913, though, mainly, a, german, artistic, movement, initially, and, most, predominant, in, painting, poetry, and, the, theatre, between, 1910, and, 1930, most, precursors, of, the, movement, were, not, german, furthermore, there, have, been, expressionist, writers, of, prose, fiction, as, well, as, non, german, speaking, expressionist, writers, and, while, the, movement, declined, in, germany, with, the, rise, of, adolf, hitler, in, the, 1930s, there, were, subsequent, expressionist, works, expressionism, is, notoriously, difficult, to, define, in, part, because, it, overlapped, with, other, major, isms, of, the, modernist, period, with, futurism, vorticism, cubism, surrealism, and, dadaism, richard, murphy, also, comments, the, search, for, an, all, inclusive, definition, is, problematic, to, the, extent, that, the, most, challenging, expressionists, such, as, kafka, gottfried, benn, and, d, blin, were, simultaneously, the, most, vociferous, anti, expressionists, what, can, be, said, however, is, that, it, was, a, movement, that, developed, in, the, early, twentieth, century, mainly, in, germany, in, reaction, to, the, dehumanizing, effect, of, industrialization, and, the, growth, of, cities, and, that, one, of, the, central, means, by, which, expressionism, identifies, itself, as, an, avant, garde, movement, and, by, which, it, marks, its, distance, to, traditions, and, the, cultural, institution, as, a, whole, is, through, its, relationship, to, realism, and, the, dominant, conventions, of, representation, more, explicitly, that, the, expressionists, rejected, the, ideology, of, realism, the, term, refers, to, an, artistic, style, in, which, the, artist, seeks, to, depict, not, objective, reality, but, rather, the, subjective, emotions, and, responses, that, objects, and, events, arouse, within, a, person, it, is, arguable, that, all, artists, are, expressive, but, there, are, many, examples, of, art, production, in, europe, from, the, 15th, century, onward, which, emphasize, extreme, emotion, such, art, often, occurs, during, times, of, social, upheaval, and, war, such, as, the, protestant, reformation, german, peasants, war, and, eighty, years, war, between, the, spanish, and, the, netherlands, when, extreme, violence, much, directed, at, civilians, was, represented, in, propagandist, popular, prints, these, were, often, unimpressive, aesthetically, but, had, the, capacity, to, arouse, extreme, emotions, in, the, viewer, expressionism, has, been, likened, to, baroque, by, critics, such, as, art, historian, michel, ragon, and, german, philosopher, walter, benjamin, according, to, alberto, arbasino, a, difference, between, the, two, is, that, expressionism, doesn, t, shun, the, violently, unpleasant, effect, while, baroque, does, expressionism, throws, some, terrific, fuck, yous, baroque, doesn, t, baroque, is, well, mannered, some, of, the, style, s, main, visual, artists, of, the, early, 20th, century, were, the, style, originated, principally, in, germany, and, austria, there, were, groups, of, expressionist, painters, including, der, blaue, reiter, and, die, br, cke, der, blaue, reiter, the, blue, rider, named, after, a, painting, was, based, in, munich, and, die, br, cke, the, bridge, was, originally, based, in, dresden, some, members, moved, to, berlin, die, br, cke, was, active, for, a, longer, period, than, der, blaue, reiter, which, was, only, together, for, a, year, 1912, the, expressionists, were, influenced, by, artists, and, sources, including, edvard, munch, vincent, van, gogh, and, african, art, they, were, also, aware, of, the, work, being, done, by, the, fauves, in, paris, who, influenced, expressionism, s, tendency, toward, arbitrary, colours, and, jarring, compositions, in, reaction, and, opposition, to, french, impressionism, which, emphasized, the, rendering, of, the, visual, appearance, of, objects, expressionist, artists, sought, to, portray, emotions, and, subjective, interpretations, it, was, not, important, to, reproduce, an, aesthetically, pleasing, impression, of, the, artistic, subject, matter, they, felt, but, rather, to, represent, vivid, emotional, reactions, by, powerful, colours, and, dynamic, compositions, kandinsky, the, main, artist, of, der, blaue, reiter, believed, that, with, simple, colours, and, shapes, the, spectator, could, perceive, the, moods, and, feelings, in, the, paintings, a, theory, that, encouraged, him, towards, increased, abstraction, in, paris, a, group, of, artists, dubbed, the, cole, de, paris, school, of, paris, by, andr, warnod, were, also, known, for, their, expressionist, art, this, was, especially, prevalent, amongst, the, foreign, born, jewish, painters, of, the, school, of, paris, such, as, chaim, soutine, marc, chagall, yitzhak, frenkel, abraham, mintchine, and, others, these, artists, expressionism, was, described, as, restless, and, emotional, by, frenkel, these, artists, centered, in, the, montparnasse, district, of, paris, tended, to, portray, human, subjects, and, humanity, evoking, emotion, through, facial, expression, others, focused, on, the, expression, of, mood, rather, than, a, formal, structure, the, art, of, jewish, expressionists, was, characterized, as, dramatic, and, tragic, perhaps, in, connection, to, jewish, suffering, following, persecution, and, pogroms, the, ideas, of, german, expressionism, influenced, the, work, of, american, artist, marsden, hartley, who, met, kandinsky, in, germany, in, 1913, in, late, 1939, at, the, beginning, of, world, war, ii, new, york, city, received, many, european, artists, after, the, war, expressionism, influenced, many, young, american, artists, norris, embry, 1921, 1981, studied, with,

expressionist, other, american, artists, of, the, late, 20th, and, early, 21st, century, have, developed, distinct, styles, that, may, be, considered, part, of, expressionism, another, prominent,

wrote, that, the, new, figurative, painting, which, some, have, been, expecting, as, a, reaction, against, abstract, expressionism, was, implicit, in, it, at, the, start, and, is, one, of, its, most, lineal, continuities, the, expressionist, movement, included, other, types, of, culture, including, dance, sculpture, cinema, and, theatre, exponents, of, expressionist, dance, included, mary, wigman,
