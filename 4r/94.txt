conventions, for, example, paranorman, these, are, what, can, be, collectively, referred, to, as, children, s, horror, although, it, is, unknown, for, sure, why, children, enjoy, these, movies, as, it, seems, counter, intuitive, it, is, theorized, that, it, is, in, part, grotesque, monsters, that, fascinate, kids, tangential, to, this, the, internalized, impact, of, horror, television, programs, and, films, on, children, is, rather, under, researched, especially, when, compared, to, the, research, done, on, the, similar, subject, of, violence, in, tv, and, film, s, impact, on, the, young, mind, what, little, research, there, is, tends, to, be, inconclusive, on, the, impact, that, viewing, such, media, has, one, defining, trait, of, the, horror, genre, is, that, it, provokes, an, emotional, psychological, or, physical, response, within, readers, that, causes, them, to, react, with, fear, one, of, h, p, lovecraft, s, most, famous, quotes, about, the, genre, is, that, the, oldest, and, strongest, emotion, of, mankind, is, fear, and, the, oldest, and, strongest, kind, of, fear, is, fear, of, the, unknown, the, first, sentence, from, his, seminal, essay, supernatural, horror, in, literature, science, fiction, historian, darrell, schweitzer, has, stated, in, the, simplest, sense, a, horror, story, is, one, that, scares, us, and, the, true, horror, story, requires, a, sense, of, evil, not, in, necessarily, in, a, theological, sense, but, the, menaces, must, be, truly, menacing, life, destroying, and, antithetical, to, happiness, in, her, essay, elements, of, aversion, elizabeth, barrette, articulates, the, need, by, some, for, horror, tales, in, a, modern, world, the, old, fight, or, flight, reaction, of, our, evolutionary, heritage, once, played, a, major, role, in, the, life, of, every, human, our, ancestors, lived, and, died, by, it, then, someone, invented, the, fascinating, game, of, civilization, and, things, began, to, calm, down, development, pushed, wilderness, back, from, settled, lands, war, crime, and, other, forms, of, social, violence, came, with, civilization, and, humans, started, preying, on, each, other, but, by, and, large, daily, life, calmed, down, we, began, to, feel, restless, to, feel, something, missing, the, excitement, of, living, on, the, edge, the, tension, between, hunter, and, hunted, so, we, told, each, other, stories, through, the, long, dark, nights, when, the, fires, burned, low, we, did, our, best, to, scare, the, daylights, out, of, each, other, the, rush, of, adrenaline, feels, good, our, hearts, pound, our, breath, quickens, and, we, can, imagine, ourselves, on, the, edge, yet, we, also, appreciate, the, insightful, aspects, of, horror, sometimes, a, story, intends, to, shock, and, disgust, but, the, best, horror, intends, to, rattle, our, cages, and, shake, us, out, of, our, complacency, it, makes, us, think, forces, us, to, confront, ideas, we, might, rather, ignore, and, challenges, preconceptions, of, all, kinds, horror, reminds, us, that, the, world, is, not, always, as, safe, as, it, seems, which, exercises, our, mental, muscles, and, reminds, us, to, keep, a, little, healthy, caution, close, at, hand, in, a, sense, similar, to, the, reason, a, person, seeks, out, the, controlled, thrill, of, a, roller, coaster, readers, in, the, modern, era, seek, out, feelings, of, horror, and, terror, to, feel, a, sense, of, excitement, however, barrette, adds, that, horror, fiction, is, one, of, the, few, mediums, where, readers, seek, out, a, form, of, art, that, forces, themselves, to, confront, ideas, and, images, they, might, rather, ignore, to, challenge, preconceptions, of, all, kinds, one, can, see, the, confrontation, of, ideas, that, readers, and, characters, would, rather, ignore, throughout, literature, in, famous, moments, such, as, hamlet, s, musings, about, the, skull, of, yorick, its, implications, of, the, mortality, of, humanity, and, the, gruesome, end, that, bodies, inevitably, come, to, in, horror, fiction, the, confrontation, with, the, gruesome, is, often, a, metaphor, for, the, problems, facing, the, current, generation, of, the, author, there, are, many, theories, as, to, why, people, enjoy, being, scared, for, example, people, who, like, horror, films, are, more, likely, to, score, highly, for, openness, to, experience, a, personality, trait, linked, to, intellect, and, imagination, it, is, a, now, commonly, accepted, view, that, the, horror, elements, of, dracula, s, portrayal, of, vampirism, are, metaphors, for, sexuality, in, a, repressed, victorian, era, but, this, is, merely, one, of, many, interpretations, of, the, metaphor, of, dracula, jack, halberstam, postulates, many, of, these, in, his, essay, technologies, of, monstrosity, bram, stoker, s, dracula, he, writes, image, of, dusty, and, unused, gold, coins, from, many, nations, and, old, unworn, jewels, immediately, connects, dracula, to, the, old, money, of, a, corrupt, class, to, a, kind, of, piracy, of, nations, and, to, the, worst, excesses, of, the, aristocracy, halberstram, articulates, a, view, of, dracula, as, manifesting, the, growing, perception, of, the, aristocracy, as, an, evil, and, outdated, notion, to, be, defeated, the, depiction, of, a, multinational, band, of, protagonists, using, the, latest, technologies, such, as, a, telegraph, to, quickly, share, collate, and, act, upon, new, information, is, what, leads, to, the, destruction, of, the, vampire, this, is, one, of, many, interpretations, of, the, metaphor, of, only, one, central, figure, of, the, canon, of, horror, fiction, as, over, a, dozen, possible, metaphors, are, referenced, in, the, analysis, from, the, religious, to, the, antisemitic, no, l, carroll, s, philosophy, of, horror, postulates, that, a, modern, piece, of, horror, fiction, s, monster, villain, or, a, more, inclusive, menace, must, exhibit, the, following, two, traits, in, addition, to, those, essays, and, articles, shown, above, scholarship, on, horror, fiction, is, almost, as, old, as, horror, fiction, itself, in, 1826, the, gothic, novelist, ann, radcliffe, published, an, essay, distinguishing, two, elements, of, horror, fiction, terror, and, horror, whereas, terror, is, a, feeling, of, dread, that, takes, place, before, an, event, happens, horror, is, a, feeling, of, revulsion, or, disgust, after, an, event, has, happened, radcliffe, describes, terror, as, that, which, expands, the, soul, and, awakens, the, faculties, to, a, high, degree, of, life, whereas, horror, is, described, as, that, which, freezes, and, nearly, annihilates, them, modern, scholarship, on, horror, fiction, draws, upon, a, range, of, sources, in, their, historical, studies, of, the, gothic, novel, both, devendra, varma, and, s, l, varnado, make, reference, to, the, theologian, rudolf, otto, whose, concept, of, the, numinous, was, originally, used, to, describe, religious, experience, a, recent, survey, reports, how, often, horror, media, is, consumed, to, assess, frequency, of, horror, consumption, we, asked, respondents, the, following, question, in, the, past, year, about, how, often, have, you, used, horror, media, for, example, horror, literature, film, and, video, games, for, entertainment, 11, 3, said, never, 7, 5, once, 28, 9, several, times, 14, 1, once, a, month, 20, 8, several, times, a, month, 7, 3, once, a, week, and, 10, 2, several, times, a, week, evidently, then, most, respondents, 81, 3, claimed, to, use, horror, media, several, times, a, year, or, more, often, unsurprisingly, there, is, a, strong, correlation, between, liking, and, frequency, of, use, r, 79, p, 0001, achievements, in, horror, fiction, are,
