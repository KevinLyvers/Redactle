year, living, temporarily, in, the, frontier, town, of, dawson, city, before, moving, to, a, nearby, winter, camp, where, he, spent, the, winter, in, a, temporary, shelter, reading, books, he, had,

where, fresh, produce, was, unavailable, when, his, gums, began, to, swell, he, decided, to, return, to, california, with, his, companions, he, rafted, 2, 000, miles, 3, 200, km, down, the, yukon, river, through, portions, of, the, wildest, territory, in, the, region, until, they, reached, st, michael, there, he, hired, himself, out, on, a, boat, to, earn, return, passage, to, san, francisco, in, alaska, london, found, the, material, that, inspired, him, to, write, the, call, of, the, wild, dyea, beach, was, the, primary, point, of, arrival, for, miners, when, london, traveled, through, there, but, because, its, access, was, treacherous, skagway, soon, became, the, new, arrival, point, for, prospectors, to, reach, the, klondike, miners, had, to, navigate, white, pass, known, as, dead, horse, pass, where, horse, carcasses, littered, the, route, because, they, could, not, survive, the, harsh, and, steep, ascent, horses, were, replaced, with, dogs, as, pack, animals, to, transport, material, over, the, pass, particularly, strong, dogs, with, thick, fur, were, much, desired, scarce, and, high, in, price, london, would, have, seen, many, dogs, especially, prized, husky, sled, dogs, in, dawson, city, and, the, winter, camps, situated, close, to, the, main, sled, route, he, was, friends, with, marshall, latham, bond, and, his, brother, louis, whitford, bond, the, owners, of, a, mixed, st, bernard, scotch, collie, dog, about, which, london, later, wrote, yes, buck, is, based, on, your, dog, at, dawson, beinecke, library, at, yale, university, holds, a, photograph, of, bond, s, dog, taken, during, london, s, stay, in, the, klondike, in, 1897, the, depiction, of, the, california, ranch, at, the, beginning, of, the, story, was, based, on, the, bond, family, ranch, on, his, return, to, california, london, was, unable, to, find, work, and, relied, on, odd, jobs, such, as, cutting, grass, he, submitted, a, query, letter, to, the, san, francisco, bulletin, proposing, a, story, about, his, alaskan, adventure, but, the, idea, was, rejected, because, as, the, editor, told, him, interest, in, alaska, has, subsided, to, an, amazing, degree, a, few, years, later, london, wrote, a, short, story, about, a, dog, named, b, tard, who, at, the, end, of, the, story, kills, his, master, london, sold, the, piece, to, cosmopolitan, magazine, which, published, it, in, the, june, 1902, issue, under, the, title, diablo, a, dog, london, s, biographer, earle, labor, says, that, london, then, began, work, on, the, call, of, the, wild, to, redeem, the, species, from, his, dark, characterization, of, dogs, in, b, tard, expecting, to, write, a, short, story, london, explains, i, meant, it, to, be, a, companion, to, my, other, dog, story, b, tard, but, it, got, away, from, me, and, instead, of, 4, 000, words, it, ran, 32, 000, before, i, could, call, a, halt, written, as, a, frontier, story, about, the, gold, rush, the, call, of, the, wild, was, meant, for, the, pulp, market, it, was, first, published, in, five, installments, in, the, saturday, evening, post, which, bought, it, for, 750, in, 1903, 25, 433, in, 2023, in, the, same, year, london, sold, all, rights, to, the, story, to, macmillan, which, published, it, in, book, format, the, book, has, never, been, out, of, print, since, that, time, the, call, of, the, wild, falls, into, the, categories, of, adventure, fiction, and, what, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, animal, story, genre, in, which, an, author, attempts, to, write, an, animal, protagonist, without, resorting, to, anthropomorphism, at, the, time, london, was, criticized, for, attributing, unnatural, human, thoughts, and, insights, to, a, dog, so, much, so, that, he, was, accused, of, being, a, nature, faker, london, himself, dismissed, these, criticisms, as, homocentric, and, amateur, london, further, responded, that, he, had, set, out, to, portray, nature, more, accurately, than, his, predecessors, i, have, been, guilty, of, writing, two, animal, stories, two, books, about, dogs, the, writing, of, these, two, stories, on, my, part, was, in, truth, a, protest, against, the, humanizing, of, animals, of, which, it, seemed, to, me, several, animal, writers, had, been, profoundly, guilty, time, and, again, and, many, times, in, my, narratives, i, wrote, speaking, of, my, dog, heroes, he, did, not, think, these, things, he, merely, did, them, etc, and, i, did, this, repeatedly, to, the, clogging, of, my, narrative, and, in, violation, of, my, artistic, canons, and, i, did, it, to, hammer, into, the, average, human, understanding, that, these, dog, heroes, of, mine, were, not, directed, by, abstract, reasoning, but, by, instinct, sensation, and, emotion, and, by, simple, reasoning, also, i, endeavored, to, make, my, stories, in, line, with, the, facts, of, evolution, i, hewed, them, to, the, mark, set, by, scientific, research, and, awoke, one, day, to, find, myself, bundled, neck, and, crop, into, the, camp, of, the, nature, fakers, along, with, his, contemporaries, frank, norris, and, theodore, dreiser, london, was, influenced, by, the, naturalism, of, european, writers, such, as, mile, zola, in, which, themes, such, as, heredity, versus, environment, were, explored, london, s, use, of, the, genre, gave, it, a, new, vibrancy, according, to, scholar, richard, lehan, the, story, is, also, an, example, of, american, pastoralism, a, prevailing, theme, in, american, literature, in, which, the, mythic, hero, returns, to, nature, as, with, other, characters, of, american, literature, such, as, rip, van, winkle, and, huckleberry, finn, buck, symbolizes, a, reaction, against, industrialization, and, social, convention, with, a, return, to, nature, london, presents, the, motif, simply, clearly, and, powerfully, in, the, story, a, motif, later, echoed, by, 20th, century, american, writers, william, faulkner, and, ernest, hemingway, most, notably, in, big, two, hearted, river, e, l, doctorow, says, of, the, story, that, it, is, fervently, american, the, enduring, appeal, of, the, story, according, to, american, literature, scholar, donald, pizer, is, that, it, is, a, combination, of, allegory, parable, and, fable, the, story, incorporates, elements, of, age, old, animal, fables, such, as, aesop, s, fables, in, which, animals, speak, the, truth, and, traditional, beast, fables, in, which, the, beast, substitutes, wit, for, insight, london, was, influenced, by, rudyard, kipling, s, the, jungle, book, written, a, few, years, earlier, with, its, combination, of, parable, and, animal, fable, and, by, other, animal, stories, popular, in, the, early, 20th, century, in, the, call, of, the, wild, london, intensifies, and, adds, layers, of, meaning, that, are, lacking, in, these, stories, as, a, writer, london, tended, to, skimp, on, form, according, to, biographer, labor, and, neither, the, call, of, the, wild, nor, white, fang, is, a, conventional, novel, the, story, follows, the, archetypal, myth, of, the, hero, buck, who, is, the, hero, takes, a, journey, is, transformed, and, achieves, an, apotheosis, the, format, of, the, story, is, divided, into, four, distinct, parts, according, to, labor, in, the, first, part, buck, experiences, violence, and, struggles, for, survival, in, the, second, part, he, proves, himself, a, leader, of, the, pack, the, third, part, brings, him, to, his, death, symbolically, and, almost, literally, and, in, the, fourth, and, final, part, he, undergoes, rebirth, london, s, story, is, a, tale, of, survival, and, a, return, to, primitivism, pizer, writes, that, the, strong, the, shrewd, and, the, cunning, shall, prevail, when, life, is, bestial, pizer, also, finds, evidence, in, the, story, of, a, christian, theme, of, love, and, redemption, as, shown, by, buck, s, refusal, to, revert, to, violence, until, after, the, death, of, thornton, who, had, won, buck, s, love, and, loyalty, london, who, went, so, far, as, to, fight, for, custody, of, one, of, his, own, dogs, understood, that, loyalty, between, dogs, particularly, working, dogs, and, their, masters, is, built, on, trust, and, love, writing, in, the, introduction, to, the, modern, library, edition, of, the, call, of, the, wild, e, l, doctorow, says, the, theme, is, based, on, darwin, s, concept, of, the, survival, of, the, fittest, london, places, buck, in, conflict, with, humans, in, conflict, with, the, other, dogs, and, in, conflict, with, his, environment, all, of, which, he, must, challenge, survive, and, conquer, buck, a, domesticated, dog, must, call, on, his, atavistic, hereditary, traits, to, survive, he, must, learn, to, be, wild, to, become, wild, according, to, tina, gianquitto, he, learns, that, in, a, world, where, the, club, and, the, fang, are, law, where, the, law, of, the, pack, rules, and, a, good, natured, dog, such, as, curly, can, be, torn, to, pieces, by, pack, members, survival, by, whatever, means, is, paramount, london, also, explores, the, idea, of, nature, vs, nurture, buck, raised, as, a, pet, is, by, heredity, a, wolf, the, change, of, environment, brings, up, his, innate, characteristics, and, strengths, to, the, point, where, he, fights, for, survival, and, becomes, the, leader, of, the, pack, pizer, describes, how, the, story, reflects, human, nature, in, its, prevailing, theme, of, strength, particularly, in, the, face, of, harsh, circumstances, the, veneer, of, civilization, is, thin, and, fragile, writes, doctorow, and, london, exposes, the, brutality, at, the, core, of, humanity, and, the, ease, with, which, humans, revert, to, a, state, of, primitivism, his, interest, in, marxism, is, evident, in, the, sub, theme, that, humanity, is, motivated, by, materialism, and, his, interest, in, nietzschean, philosophy, is, shown, by, buck, s, characterization, gianquitto, writes, that, in, buck, s, characterization, london, created, a, type, of, nietzschean, bermensch, in, this, case, a, dog, that, reaches, mythic, proportions, doctorow, sees, the, story, as, a, caricature, of, a, bildungsroman, in, which, a, character, learns, and, grows, in, that, buck, becomes, progressively, less, civilized, gianquitto, explains, that, buck, has, evolved, to, the, point, that, he, is, ready, to, join, a, wolf, pack, which, has, a, social, structure, uniquely, adapted, to, and, successful, in, the, harsh, arctic, environment, unlike, humans, who, are, weak, in, the, harsh, environment, old, longings, nomadic, leap, chafing, at, custom, s, chain, again, from, its, brumal, sleep, wakens, the, ferine, strain, john, myers, o, hara, atavism, the, first, chapter, opens, with, the, first, quatrain, of, john, myers, o, hara, s, poem, atavism, published, in, 1902, in, the, bookman, the, stanza, outlines, one, of, the, main, motifs, of, the, call, of, the, wild, that, buck, when, removed, from, the, sun, kissed, santa, clara, valley, where, he, was, raised, will, revert, to, his, wolf, heritage, with, its, innate, instincts, and, characteristics, the, themes, are, conveyed, through, london, s, use, of, symbolism, and, imagery, which, according, to, labor, vary, in, the, different, phases, of, the, story, the, imagery, and, symbolism, in, the, first, phase, to, do, with, the, journey, and, self, discovery, depict, physical, violence, with, strong, images, of, pain, and, blood, in, the, second, phase, fatigue, becomes, a, dominant, image, and, death, is, a, dominant, symbol, as, buck, comes, close, to, being, killed, the, third, phase, is, a, period, of, renewal, and, rebirth, and, takes, place, in, the, spring, before, ending, with, the, fourth, phase, when, buck, fully, reverts, to, nature, and, is, placed, in, a, vast, and, weird, atmosphere, a, place, of, pure, emptiness, the, setting, is, allegorical, the, southern, lands, represent, the, soft, materialistic, world, the, northern, lands, symbolize, a, world, beyond, civilization, and, are, inherently, competitive, the, harshness, brutality, and, emptiness, in, alaska, reduce, life, to, its, essence, as, london, learned, and, it, shows, in, buck, s, story, buck, must, defeat, spitz, the, dog, who, symbolically, tries, to, get, ahead, and, take, control, when, buck, is, sold, to, charles, hal, and, mercedes, he, finds, himself, in, a, dirty, camp, they, treat, their, dogs, badly, they, are, artificial, interlopers, in, the, pristine, landscape, conversely, buck, s, next, masters, john, thornton, and, his, two, companions, are, described, as, living, close, to, the, earth, they, keep, a, clean, camp, treat, their, animals, well, and, represent, man, s, nobility, in, nature, unlike, buck, thornton, loses, his, fight, with, his, fellow, species, and, not, until, thornton, s, death, does, buck, revert, fully, to, the, wild, and, his, primordial, state, the, characters, too, are, symbolic, of, types, charles, hal, and, mercedes, symbolize, vanity, and, ignorance, while, thornton, and, his, companions, represent, loyalty, purity, and, love, much, of, the, imagery, is, stark, and, simple, with, an, emphasis, on, images, of, cold, snow, ice, darkness, meat, and, blood, london, varied, his, prose, style, to, reflect, the, action, he, wrote, in, an, over, affected, style, in, his, descriptions, of, charles, hal, and, mercedes, camp, as, a, reflection, of, their, intrusion, into, the, wilderness, conversely, when, describing, buck, and, his, actions, london, wrote, in, a, style, that, was, pared, down, and, simple, a, style, that, would, influence, and, be, the, forebear, of, hemingway, s, style, the, story, was, written, as, a, frontier, adventure, and, in, such, a, way, that, it, worked, well, as, a, serial, as, doctorow, points, out, it, is, good, episodic, writing, that, embodies, the, style, of, magazine, adventure, writing, popular, in, that, period, it, leaves, us, with, satisfaction, at, its, outcome, a, story, well, and, truly, told, he, said, the, call, of, the, wild, was, enormously, popular, from, the, moment, it, was, published, h, l, mencken, wrote, of, london, s, story, no, other, popular, writer, of, his, time, did, any, better, writing, than, you, will, find, in, the, call, of, the, wild, a, reviewer, for, the, new, york, times, wrote, of, it, in, 1903, if, nothing, else, makes, mr, london, s, book, popular, it, ought, to, be, rendered, so, by, the, complete, way, in, which, it, will, satisfy, the, love, of, dog, fights, apparently, inherent, in, every, man, the, reviewer, for, the, atlantic, monthly, wrote, that, it, was, a, book, untouched, by, bookishness, the, making, and, the, achievement, of, such, a, hero, constitute, not, a, pretty, story, at, all, but, a, very, powerful, one, the, book, secured, london, a, place, in, the, canon, of, american, literature, the, first, printing, of, 10, 000, copies, sold, out, immediately, it, is, still, one, of, the, best, known, stories, written, by, an, american, author, and, continues, to, be, read, and, taught, in, schools, it, has, been, published, in, 47, languages, london, s, first, success, the, book, secured, his, prospects, as, a, writer, and, gained, him, a, readership, that, stayed, with, him, throughout, his, career, after, the, success, of, the, call, of, the, wild, london, wrote, to, macmillan, in, 1904, proposing, a, second, book, white, fang, in, which, he, wanted, to, describe, the, opposite, of, buck, a, dog, that, transforms, from, wild, to, tame, i, m, going, to, reverse, the, process, instead, of, devolution, of, decivilization, i, m, going, to, give, the, evolution, the, civilization, of, a, dog, the, 1993, movie, starring, rick,
