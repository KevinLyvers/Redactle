a, lute, lj, u, t, or, l, u, t, is, any, plucked, string, instrument, with, a, neck, and, a, deep, round, back, enclosing, a, hollow, cavity, usually, with, a, sound, hole, or, opening, in, the, body, it, may, be, either, fretted, or, unfretted, more, specifically, the, term, lute, commonly, refers, to, an, instrument, from, the, family, of, european, lutes, which, were, themselves, influenced, by, indian, short, necked, lutes, in, gandhara, which, became, the, predecessor, of, the, islamic, the, sino, japanese, and, the, european, lute, families, the, term, also, refers, generally, to, any, necked, string, instrument, having, the, strings, running, in, a, plane, parallel, to, the, sound, table, in, the, hornbostel, sachs, system, the, strings, are, attached, to, pegs, or, posts, at, the, end, of, the, neck, which, have, some, type, of, turning, mechanism, to, enable, the, player, to, tighten, the, tension, on, the, string, or, loosen, the, tension, before, playing, which, respectively, raise, or, lower, the, pitch, of, a, string, so, that, each, string, is, tuned, to, a, specific, pitch, or, note, the, lute, is, plucked, or, strummed, with, one, hand, while, the, other, hand, frets, presses, down, the, strings, on, the, neck, s, fingerboard, by, pressing, the, strings, on, different, places, of, the, fingerboard, the, player, can, shorten, or, lengthen, the, part, of, the, string, that, is, vibrating, thus, producing, higher, or, lower, pitches, notes, the, european, lute, and, the, modern, near, eastern, oud, descend, from, a, common, ancestor, via, diverging, evolutionary, paths, the, lute, is, used, in, a, great, variety, of, instrumental, music, from, the, medieval, to, the, late, baroque, eras, and, was, the, most, important, instrument, for, secular, music, in, the, renaissance, during, the, baroque, music, era, the, lute, was, used, as, one, of, the, instruments, that, played, the, basso, continuo, accompaniment, parts, it, is, also, an, accompanying, instrument, in, vocal, works, the, lute, player, either, improvises, realizes, a, chordal, accompaniment, based, on, the, figured, bass, part, or, plays, a, written, out, accompaniment, both, music, notation, and, tablature, tab, are, used, for, lute, as, a, small, instrument, the, lute, produces, a, relatively, quiet, sound, the, player, of, a, lute, is, called, a, lutenist, lutanist, or, lutist, and, a, maker, of, lutes, or, any, similar, string, instrument, or, violin, family, instruments, is, referred, to, as, a, luthier, curt, sachs, defined, lute, in, the, terminology, section, of, the, history, of, musical, instruments, as, composed, of, a, body, and, of, a, neck, which, serves, both, as, a, handle, and, as, a, means, of, stretching, the, strings, beyond, the, body, his, definition, focused, on, body, and, neck, characteristics, and, not, on, the, way, the, strings, were, sounded, so, the, fiddle, counted, as, a, bowed, lute, sachs, also, distinguished, between, the, long, necked, lute, and, the, short, necked, variety, the, short, necked, variety, contained, most, of, our, modern, instruments, lutes, guitars, hurdy, gurdies, and, the, entire, family, of, viols, and, violins, the, long, lutes, were, the, more, ancient, lutes, the, arabic, tanb, r, faithfully, preserved, the, outer, appearance, of, the, ancient, lutes, of, babylonia, and, egypt, he, further, categorized, long, lutes, with, a, pierced, lute, and, long, neck, lute, the, pierced, lute, had, a, neck, made, from, a, stick, that, pierced, the, body, as, in, the, ancient, egyptian, long, neck, lutes, and, the, modern, african, gunbr, the, long, lute, had, an, attached, neck, and, included, the, sitar, tanbur, and, tar, the, dut, r, had, two, strings, set, r, three, strings, rt, r, four, strings, pan, t, r, five, strings, sachs, s, book, is, from, 1941, and, the, archaeological, evidence, available, to, him, placed, the, early, lutes, at, about, 2000, bc, discoveries, since, then, have, pushed, the, existence, of, the, lute, back, to, c, 3100, bc, musicologist, richard, dumbrill, today, uses, the, word, lute, more, categorically, to, discuss, instruments, that, existed, millennia, before, the, term, lute, was, coined, dumbrill, documented, more, than, 3, 000, years, of, iconographic, evidence, of, the, lutes, in, mesopotamia, in, his, book, the, archaeomusicology, of, the, ancient, near, east, according, to, dumbrill, the, lute, family, included, instruments, in, mesopotamia, before, 3000, bc, he, points, to, a, cylinder, seal, as, evidence, dating, from, about, 3100, bc, or, earlier, and, now, in, the, possession, of, the, british, museum, the, seal, depicts, on, one, side, what, is, thought, to, be, a, woman, playing, a, stick, lute, like, sachs, dumbrill, saw, length, as, distinguishing, lutes, dividing, the, mesopotamian, lutes, into, a, long, variety, and, a, short, his, book, does, not, cover, the, shorter, instruments, that, became, the, european, lute, beyond, showing, examples, of, shorter, lutes, in, the, ancient, world, he, focuses, on, the, longer, lutes, of, mesopotamia, various, types, of, necked, chordophones, that, developed, throughout, the, ancient, world, indian, gandhara, and, others, greek, egyptian, in, the, middle, kingdom, iranian, elamite, and, others, jewish, israelite, hittite, roman, bulgar, turkic, chinese, armenian, cilician, cultures, he, names, among, the, long, lutes, the, pandura, and, the, tanbur, the, line, of, short, necked, lutes, was, further, developed, to, the, east, of, mesopotamia, in, bactria, and, gandhara, into, a, short, almond, shaped, lute, curt, sachs, talked, about, the, depictions, of, gandharan, lutes, in, art, where, they, are, presented, in, a, mix, of, northwest, indian, art, under, strong, greek, influences, the, short, necked, lutes, in, these, gandhara, artworks, were, the, venerable, ancestor, of, the, islamic, the, sino, japanese, and, the, european, lute, families, he, described, the, gandhara, lutes, as, having, a, pear, shaped, body, tapering, towards, the, short, neck, a, frontal, stringholder, lateral, pegs, and, either, four, or, five, strings, bactria, and, gandhara, became, part, of, the, sasanian, empire, 224, 651, under, the, sasanians, a, short, almond, shaped, lute, from, bactria, came, to, be, called, the, barbat, or, barbud, which, was, developed, into, the, later, islamic, world, s, oud, or, ud, when, the, moors, conquered, andalusia, in, 711, they, brought, their, ud, or, quitra, along, into, a, country, that, had, already, known, a, lute, tradition, under, the, romans, the, pandura, during, the, 8th, and, 9th, centuries, many, musicians, and, artists, from, across, the, islamic, world, flocked, to, iberia, among, them, was, abu, l, hasan, ali, ibn, nafi, 789, 857, a, prominent, musician, who, had, trained, under, ishaq, al, mawsili, d, 850, in, baghdad, and, was, exiled, to, andalusia, before, 833, he, taught, and, has, been, credited, with, adding, a, fifth, string, to, his, oud, and, with, establishing, one, of, the, first, schools, of, music, in, c, rdoba, by, the, 11th, century, muslim, iberia, had, become, a, center, for, the, manufacture, of, instruments, these, goods, spread, gradually, to, provence, influencing, french, troubadours, and, trouv, res, and, eventually, reaching, the, rest, of, europe, while, europe, developed, the, lute, the, oud, remained, a, central, part, of, arab, music, and, broader, ottoman, music, undergoing, a, range, of, transformations, beside, the, introduction, of, the, lute, to, spain, andalusia, by, the, moors, another, important, point, of, transfer, of, the, lute, from, arabian, to, european, culture, was, sicily, where, it, was, brought, either, by, byzantine, or, later, by, muslim, musicians, there, were, singer, lutenists, at, the, court, in, palermo, after, the, norman, conquest, of, the, island, from, the, muslims, and, the, lute, is, depicted, extensively, in, the, ceiling, paintings, in, the, palermo, s, royal, cappella, palatina, dedicated, by, the, norman, king, roger, ii, of, sicily, in, 1140, his, hohenstaufen, grandson, frederick, ii, holy, roman, emperor, 1194, 1250, continued, integrating, muslims, into, his, court, including, moorish, musicians, frederick, ii, made, visits, to, the, lech, valley, and, bavaria, between, 1218, and, 1237, with, a, moorish, sicilian, retinue, by, the, 14th, century, lutes, had, spread, throughout, italy, and, probably, because, of, the, cultural, influence, of, the, hohenstaufen, kings, and, emperor, based, in, palermo, the, lute, had, also, made, significant, inroads, into, the, german, speaking, lands, by, 1500, the, valley, and, f, ssen, had, several, lute, making, families, and, in, the, next, two, centuries, the, area, hosted, famous, names, of, 16th, and, 17th, century, lutemaking, although, the, major, entry, of, the, short, lute, was, in, western, europe, leading, to, a, variety, of, lute, styles, the, short, lute, entered, europe, in, the, east, as, well, as, early, as, the, sixth, century, the, bulgars, brought, the, short, necked, variety, of, the, instrument, called, komuz, to, the, balkans, medieval, lutes, were, four, and, five, course, instruments, plucked, with, a, quill, as, a, plectrum, there, were, several, sizes, and, by, the, end, of, the, renaissance, seven, sizes, up, to, the, great, octave, bass, are, documented, song, accompaniment, was, probably, the, lute, s, primary, function, in, the, middle, ages, but, very, little, music, securely, attributable, to, the, lute, survives, from, before, 1500, medieval, and, early, renaissance, song, accompaniments, were, probably, mostly, improvised, hence, the, lack, of, written, records, in, the, last, few, decades, of, the, fifteenth, century, to, play, renaissance, polyphony, on, a, single, instrument, lutenists, gradually, abandoned, the, quill, in, favor, of, plucking, the, instrument, with, the, fingers, the, number, of, courses, grew, to, six, and, beyond, the, lute, was, the, premier, solo, instrument, of, the, sixteenth, century, but, continued, to, accompany, singers, as, well, about, 1500, many, iberian, lutenists, adopted, vihuela, de, mano, a, viol, shaped, instrument, tuned, like, the, lute, both, instruments, continued, in, coexistence, this, instrument, also, found, its, way, to, parts, of, italy, that, were, under, spanish, domination, especially, sicily, and, the, papal, states, under, the, borgia, pope, alexander, vi, who, brought, many, catalan, musicians, to, italy, where, it, was, known, as, the, viola, da, mano, by, the, end, of, the, renaissance, the, number, of, courses, had, grown, to, ten, and, during, the, baroque, era, the, number, continued, to, grow, until, it, reached, 14, and, occasionally, as, many, as, 19, these, instruments, with, up, to, 35, strings, required, innovations, in, the, structure, of, the, lute, at, the, end, of, the, lute, s, evolution, the, archlute, theorbo, and, torban, had, long, extensions, attached, to, the, main, tuning, head, to, provide, a, greater, resonating, length, for, the, bass, strings, and, since, human, fingers, are, not, long, enough, to, stop, strings, across, a, neck, wide, enough, to, hold, 14, courses, the, bass, strings, were, placed, outside, the, fretboard, and, were, played, open, i, e, without, pressing, them, against, the, fingerboard, with, the, left, hand, the, lute, is, a, very, fragile, instrument, and, so, although, there, are, many, surviving, old, lutes, very, few, with, their, original, soundboards, are, in, playable, condition, which, makes, the, rauwolf, lute, so, notable, over, the, course, of, the, baroque, era, the, lute, was, increasingly, relegated, to, the, continuo, accompaniment, and, was, eventually, superseded, in, that, role, by, keyboard, instruments, the, lute, almost, fell, out, of, use, after, 1800, some, sorts, of, lute, were, still, used, for, some, time, in, germany, sweden, and, ukraine, the, words, lute, and, oud, possibly, derive, from, arabic, al, oud, literally, means, the, wood, it, may, refer, to, the, wooden, plectrum, traditionally, used, for, playing, the, oud, to, the, thin, strips, of, wood, used, for, the, back, or, to, the, wooden, soundboard, that, distinguished, it, from, similar, instruments, with, skin, faced, bodies, many, theories, have, been, proposed, for, the, origin, of, the, arabic, name, music, scholar, eckhard, neubauer, suggested, that, oud, may, be, an, arabic, borrowing, from, the, persian, word, r, d, or, r, d, which, meant, string, another, researcher, archaeomusicologist, richard, j, dumbrill, suggests, that, rud, came, from, the, sanskrit, rudr, meaning, string, instrument, and, transferred, to, arabic, and, european, languages, by, way, of, a, semitic, language, however, another, theory, according, to, semitic, language, scholars, is, that, the, arabic, oud, is, derived, from, syriac, oud, a, meaning, wooden, stick, and, burning, wood, cognate, to, biblical, hebrew, referring, to, a, stick, used, to, stir, logs, in, a, fire, henry, george, farmer, notes, the, similarity, between, al, d, and, al, awda, the, return, of, bliss, lutes, are, made, almost, entirely, of, wood, the, soundboard, is, a, teardrop, shaped, thin, flat, plate, of, resonant, wood, typically, spruce, in, all, lutes, the, soundboard, has, a, single, sometimes, triple, decorated, sound, hole, under, the, strings, called, the, rose, the, sound, hole, is, not, open, but, rather, covered, with, a, grille, in, the, form, of, an, intertwining, vine, or, a, decorative, knot, carved, directly, out, of, the, wood, of, the, soundboard, the, geometry, of, the, lute, soundboard, is, relatively, complex, involving, a, system, of, barring, that, places, braces, perpendicular, to, the, strings, at, specific, lengths, along, the, overall, length, of, the, belly, the, ends, of, which, are, angled, to, abut, the, ribs, on, either, side, for, structural, reasons, robert, lundberg, in, his, book, historical, lute, construction, suggests, ancient, builders, placed, bars, according, to, whole, number, ratios, of, the, scale, length, and, belly, length, he, further, suggests, the, inward, bend, of, the, soundboard, the, belly, scoop, is, a, deliberate, adaptation, by, ancient, builders, to, afford, the, lutenist, s, right, hand, more, space, between, the, strings, and, soundboard, soundboard, thickness, varies, but, generally, hovers, between, 1, 5, and, 2, mm, 0, 06, 0, 08, in, some, luthiers, tune, the, belly, as, they, build, removing, mass, and, adapting, bracing, to, produce, desirable, sonic, results, the, lute, belly, is, almost, never, finished, but, in, some, cases, the, luthier, may, size, the, top, with, a, very, thin, coat, of, shellac, or, glair, to, help, keep, it, clean, the, belly, joins, directly, to, the, rib, without, a, lining, glued, to, the, sides, and, a, cap, and, counter, cap, are, glued, to, the, inside, and, outside, of, the, bottom, end, of, the, bowl, to, provide, rigidity, and, increased, gluing, surface, after, joining, the, top, to, the, sides, a, half, binding, is, usually, installed, around, the, edge, of, the, soundboard, the, half, binding, is, approximately, half, the, thickness, of, the, soundboard, and, is, usually, made, of, a, contrasting, color, wood, the, rebate, for, the, half, binding, must, be, extremely, precise, to, avoid, compromising, structural, integrity, the, back, or, the, shell, is, assembled, from, thin, strips, of, hardwood, maple, cherry, ebony, rosewood, gran, wood, and, or, other, tonewoods, called, ribs, joined, with, glue, edge, to, edge, to, form, a, deep, rounded, body, for, the, instrument, there, are, braces, inside, on, the, soundboard, to, give, it, strength, the, neck, is, made, of, light, wood, with, a, veneer, of, hardwood, usually, ebony, to, provide, durability, for, the, fretboard, beneath, the, strings, unlike, most, modern, stringed, instruments, the, lute, s, fretboard, is, mounted, flush, with, the, top, the, pegbox, for, lutes, before, the, baroque, era, was, angled, back, from, the, neck, at, almost, 90, see, image, presumably, to, help, hold, the, low, tension, strings, firmly, against, the, nut, which, traditionally, is, not, glued, in, place, but, is, held, in, place, by, string, pressure, only, the, tuning, pegs, are, simple, pegs, of, hardwood, somewhat, tapered, that, are, held, in, place, by, friction, in, holes, drilled, through, the, pegbox, as, with, other, instruments, that, use, friction, pegs, the, wood, for, the, pegs, is, crucial, as, the, wood, suffers, dimensional, changes, through, age, and, loss, of, humidity, it, must, retain, a, reasonably, circular, cross, section, to, function, properly, as, there, are, no, gears, or, other, mechanical, aids, for, tuning, the, instrument, often, pegs, were, made, from, suitable, fruitwoods, such, as, european, pearwood, or, equally, dimensionally, stable, analogues, matheson, c, 1720, said, if, a, lute, player, has, lived, eighty, years, he, has, surely, spent, sixty, years, tuning, the, bridge, sometimes, made, of, a, fruitwood, is, attached, to, the, soundboard, typically, between, a, fifth, and, a, seventh, of, the, belly, length, it, does, not, have, a, separate, saddle, but, has, holes, bored, into, it, to, which, the, strings, attach, directly, the, bridge, is, made, so, that, it, tapers, in, height, and, length, with, the, small, end, holding, the, trebles, and, the, higher, and, wider, end, carrying, the, basses, bridges, are, often, colored, black, with, carbon, black, in, a, binder, often, shellac, and, often, have, inscribed, decoration, the, scrolls, or, other, decoration, on, the, ends, of, lute, bridges, are, integral, to, the, bridge, and, are, not, added, afterwards, as, on, some, renaissance, guitars, cf, joachim, tielke, s, guitars, the, frets, are, made, of, loops, of, gut, tied, around, the, neck, they, fray, with, use, and, must, be, replaced, from, time, to, time, a, few, additional, partial, frets, of, wood, are, usually, glued, to, the, body, of, the, instrument, to, allow, stopping, the, highest, pitched, courses, up, to, a, full, octave, higher, than, the, open, string, though, these, are, considered, anachronistic, by, some, though, john, dowland, and, thomas, robinson, describe, the, practice, of, gluing, wooden, frets, onto, the, soundboard, given, the, choice, between, nylon, and, gut, many, luthiers, prefer, to, use, gut, as, it, conforms, more, readily, to, the, sharp, angle, at, the, edge, of, the, fingerboard, strings, were, historically, made, of, animal, gut, usually, from, the, small, intestine, of, sheep, sometimes, in, combination, with, metal, and, are, still, made, of, gut, or, a, synthetic, substitute, with, metal, windings, on, the, lower, pitched, strings, modern, manufacturers, make, both, gut, and, nylon, strings, and, both, are, in, common, use, gut, is, more, authentic, for, playing, period, pieces, though, unfortunately, it, is, also, more, susceptible, to, irregularity, and, pitch, instability, owing, to, changes, in, humidity, nylon, offers, greater, tuning, stability, but, is, seen, as, anachronistic, by, purists, as, its, timbre, differs, from, the, sound, of, earlier, gut, strings, such, concerns, are, moot, when, more, recent, compositions, for, the, lute, are, performed, of, note, are, the, catlines, used, as, basses, on, historical, instruments, catlines, are, several, gut, strings, wound, together, and, soaked, in, heavy, metal, solutions, to, increase, the, string, mass, catlines, can, be, quite, large, in, diameter, compared, to, wound, nylon, strings, of, the, same, pitch, they, produce, a, bass, that, differs, somewhat, in, timbre, from, nylon, basses, the, lute, s, strings, are, arranged, in, courses, of, two, strings, each, though, the, highest, pitched, course, usually, consists, of, only, a, single, string, called, the, chanterelle, in, later, baroque, lutes, two, upper, courses, are, single, the, courses, are, numbered, sequentially, counting, from, the, highest, pitched, so, that, the, chanterelle, is, the, first, course, the, next, pair, of, strings, is, the, second, course, etc, thus, an, 8, course, renaissance, lute, usually, has, 15, strings, and, a, 13, course, baroque, lute, has, 25, the, courses, are, tuned, in, unison, for, high, and, intermediate, pitches, but, for, lower, pitches, one, of, the, two, strings, is, tuned, an, octave, higher, the, course, where, this, split, starts, changed, over, the, history, of, the, lute, the, two, strings, of, a, course, are, virtually, always, stopped, and, plucked, together, as, if, a, single, string, but, in, rare, cases, a, piece, requires, that, the, two, strings, of, a, course, be, stopped, or, plucked, separately, the, tuning, of, a, lute, is, a, complicated, issue, described, in, a, section, of, its, own, below, the, lute, s, design, makes, it, extremely, light, for, its, size, the, lute, enjoyed, a, revival, with, the, awakening, of, interest, in, historical, music, around, 1900, and, throughout, the, century, that, revival, was, further, boosted, by, the, early, music, movement, in, the, twentieth, century, important, pioneers, in, lute, revival, were, julian, bream, hans, neemann, walter, gerwig, suzanne, bloch, and, diana, poulton, lute, performances, are, now, not, uncommon, there, are, many, professional, lutenists, especially, in, europe, where, the, most, employment, is, found, and, new, compositions, for, the, instrument, are, being, produced, by, composers, during, the, early, days, of, the, early, music, movement, many, lutes, were, constructed, by, available, luthiers, whose, specialty, was, often, classical, guitars, such, lutes, were, heavily, built, with, construction, similar, to, that, of, classical, guitars, with, fan, bracing, heavy, tops, fixed, frets, and, lined, sides, all, of, which, are, anachronistic, to, historical, lutes, as, lutherie, scholarship, increased, makers, began, constructing, instruments, based, on, historical, models, which, have, proven, lighter, and, more, responsive, instruments, lutes, built, at, present, are, invariably, replicas, or, near, copies, of, those, surviving, historical, instruments, that, are, in, museums, or, private, collections, many, are, custom, built, but, there, is, a, growing, number, of, luthiers, who, build, lutes, for, general, sale, and, there, is, a, fairly, strong, if, small, second, hand, market, because, of, this, fairly, limited, market, lutes, are, generally, more, expensive, than, mass, produced, modern, instruments, factory, made, guitars, and, violins, for, example, can, be, purchased, more, cheaply, than, low, end, lutes, while, at, the, highest, level, of, modern, instruments, guitars, and, violins, tend, to, command, the, higher, prices, unlike, in, the, past, there, are, many, types, of, lutes, encountered, today, 5, course, medieval, lutes, renaissance, lutes, of, 6, to, 10, courses, in, many, pitches, for, solo, and, ensemble, performance, of, renaissance, works, the, archlute, of, baroque, works, 11, course, lutes, in, d, minor, tuning, for, 17th, century, french, german, and, czech, music, 13, 14, course, d, minor, tuned, german, baroque, lutes, for, later, high, baroque, and, classical, music, theorbo, for, basso, continuo, parts, in, baroque, ensembles, gallichons, mandoras, bandoras, orpharions, and, others, lutenistic, practice, has, reached, considerable, heights, in, recent, years, thanks, to, a, growing, number, of, world, class, lutenists, rolf, lislevand, hopkinson, smith, paul, o, dette, christopher, wilke, andreas, martin, robert, barto, eduardo, eg, ez, edin, karamazov, nigel, north, christopher, wilson, luca, pianca, yasunori, imamura, anthony, bailes, peter, croton, xavier, diaz, latorre, evangelina, mascardi, and, jakob, lindberg, singer, songwriter, sting, has, also, played, lute, and, archlute, in, and, out, of, his, collaborations, with, edin, karamazov, and, jan, akkerman, released, two, albums, of, lute, music, in, the, 1970s, while, he, was, a, guitarist, in, the, dutch, rock, band, focus, lutenist, composer, jozef, van, wissem, composed, the, soundtrack, to, the, jim, jarmusch, film, only, lovers, left, alive, lutes, were, in, widespread, use, in, europe, at, least, since, the, 13th, century, and, documents, mention, numerous, early, performers, and, composers, however, the, earliest, surviving, lute, music, dates, from, the, late, 15th, century, lute, music, flourished, during, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, numerous, composers, published, collections, of, their, music, and, modern, scholars, have, uncovered, a, vast, number, of, manuscripts, from, the, era, however, much, of, the, music, is, still, lost, in, the, second, half, of, the, 17th, century, lutes, vihuelas, and, similar, instruments, started, losing, popularity, and, little, music, was, written, for, the, instrument, after, 1750, the, interest, in, lute, music, was, revived, only, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, improvisation, making, up, music, on, the, spot, was, apparently, an, important, aspect, of, lute, performance, so, much, of, the, repertoire, was, probably, never, written, down, furthermore, it, was, only, around, 1500, that, lute, players, began, to, transition, from, plectrum, to, plucking, that, change, facilitated, complex, polyphony, which, required, that, they, develop, notation, in, the, next, hundred, years, three, schools, of, tablature, notation, gradually, developed, italian, also, used, in, spain, german, and, french, only, the, last, survived, into, the, late, 17th, century, the, earliest, known, tablatures, are, for, a, six, stringed, instrument, though, evidence, of, earlier, four, and, five, stringed, lutes, exists, tablature, notation, depends, on, the, actual, instrument, the, music, is, written, for, to, read, it, a, musician, must, know, the, instrument, s, tuning, number, of, strings, etc, renaissance, and, baroque, forms, of, lute, music, are, similar, to, keyboard, music, of, the, periods, intabulations, of, vocal, works, were, very, common, as, well, as, various, dances, some, of, which, disappeared, during, the, 17th, century, such, as, the, piva, and, the, saltarello, the, advent, of, polyphony, brought, about, fantasias, complex, intricate, pieces, with, much, use, of, imitative, counterpoint, the, improvisatory, element, present, to, some, degree, in, most, lute, pieces, is, particularly, evident, in, the, early, ricercares, not, imitative, as, their, later, namesakes, but, completely, free, as, well, as, in, numerous, preludial, forms, preludes, tastar, de, corde, testing, the, strings, etc, during, the, 17th, century, keyboard, and, lute, music, went, hand, in, hand, and, by, 1700, lutenists, were, writing, suites, of, dances, quite, akin, to, those, of, keyboard, composers, the, lute, was, also, used, throughout, its, history, as, an, ensemble, instrument, most, frequently, in, songs, for, voice, and, lute, which, were, particularly, popular, in, italy, see, frottola, and, england, the, earliest, surviving, lute, music, is, italian, from, a, late, 15th, century, manuscript, the, early, 16th, century, saw, petrucci, s, publications, of, lute, music, by, francesco, spinacino, fl, 1507, and, joan, ambrosio, dalza, fl, 1508, together, with, the, so, called, capirola, lutebook, these, represent, the, earliest, stage, of, written, lute, music, in, italy, the, leader, of, the, next, generation, of, italian, lutenists, francesco, canova, da, milano, 1497, 1543, is, now, acknowledged, as, one, of, the, most, famous, lute, composers, in, history, the, bigger, part, of, his, output, consists, of, pieces, called, fantasias, or, ricercares, in, which, he, makes, extensive, use, of, imitation, and, sequence, expanding, the, scope, of, lute, polyphony, in, the, early, 17th, century, johannes, hieronymus, kapsberger, c, 1580, 1651, and, alessandro, piccinini, 1566, 1638, revolutionized, the, instrument, s, technique, and, kapsberger, possibly, influenced, the, keyboard, music, of, girolamo, frescobaldi, french, written, lute, music, began, as, far, as, we, know, with, pierre, attaingnant, s, c, 1494, c, 1551, prints, which, comprised, preludes, dances, and, intabulations, particularly, important, was, the, italian, composer, albert, de, rippe, 1500, 1551, who, worked, in, france, and, composed, polyphonic, fantasias, of, considerable, complexity, his, work, was, published, posthumously, by, his, pupil, guillaume, de, morlaye, born, c, 1510, who, however, did, not, pick, up, the, complex, polyphony, of, de, rippe, french, lute, music, declined, during, the, second, part, of, the, 16th, century, however, various, changes, to, the, instrument, the, increase, of, diapason, strings, new, tunings, etc, prompted, an, important, change, in, style, that, led, during, the, early, baroque, to, the, celebrated, style, bris, broken, arpeggiated, textures, that, influenced, johann, jakob, froberger, s, suites, the, french, baroque, school, is, exemplified, by, composers, such, as, ennemond, gaultier, 1575, 1651, denis, gaultier, 1597, 1603, 1672, fran, ois, dufaut, before, 1604, before, 1672, and, many, others, the, last, stage, of, french, lute, music, is, exemplified, by, robert, de, vis, e, c, 1655, 1732, 3, whose, suites, exploit, the, instrument, s, possibilities, to, the, fullest, the, history, of, german, written, lute, music, started, with, arnolt, schlick, c, 1460, after, 1521, who, in, 1513, published, a, collection, of, pieces, that, included, 14, voice, and, lute, songs, and, three, solo, lute, pieces, alongside, organ, works, he, was, not, the, first, important, german, lutenist, because, contemporaries, credited, conrad, paumann, c, 1410, 1473, with, the, invention, of, german, lute, tablature, though, this, claim, remains, unproven, and, no, lute, works, by, paumann, survive, after, schlick, a, string, of, composers, developed, german, lute, music, hans, judenk, nig, c, 1445, 50, 1526, the, neusidler, family, particularly, hans, neusidler, c, 1508, 09, 1563, and, others, during, the, second, half, of, the, 16th, century, german, tablature, and, german, repertoire, were, gradually, replaced, by, italian, and, french, tablature, and, international, repertoire, respectively, and, the, thirty, years, war, 1618, 1648, effectively, stopped, publications, for, half, a, century, german, lute, music, was, revived, much, later, by, composers, such, as, esaias, reusner, fl, 1670, however, a, distinctly, german, style, came, only, after, 1700, in, the, works, of, silvius, leopold, weiss, 1686, 1750, one, of, the, greatest, lute, composers, some, of, whose, works, were, transcribed, for, keyboard, by, none, other, than, johann, sebastian, bach, 1685, 1750, who, composed, a, few, pieces, for, the, lute, himself, though, it, is, unclear, whether, they, were, really, intended, for, the, lute, rather, than, another, plucked, string, instrument, or, the, lautenwerk, of, other, european, countries, particularly, important, are, england, and, spain, english, written, lute, music, began, only, around, 1540, however, the, country, produced, numerous, lutenists, of, which, john, dowland, 1563, 1626, is, perhaps, the, most, famous, his, influence, spread, very, far, variations, on, his, themes, were, written, by, keyboard, composers, in, germany, decades, after, his, death, dowland, s, predecessors, and, colleagues, such, as, anthony, holborne, c, 1545, 1602, and, daniel, bacheler, 1572, 1619, were, less, known, spanish, composers, wrote, mostly, for, the, vihuela, their, main, genres, were, polyphonic, fantasias, and, differencias, variations, luys, milan, c, 1500, after, 1560, and, luys, de, narv, ez, fl, 1526, 1549, were, particularly, important, for, their, contributions, to, the, development, of, lute, polyphony, in, spain, finally, perhaps, the, most, influential, european, lute, composer, was, the, hungarian, b, lint, bakfark, c, 1526, 30, 1576, whose, contrapuntal, fantasias, were, much, more, difficult, and, tighter, than, those, of, his, western, european, contemporaries, ottorino, respighi, s, famous, orchestral, suites, called, ancient, airs, and, dances, are, drawn, from, various, books, and, articles, on, 16th, and, 17th, century, lute, music, transcribed, by, the, musicologist, oscar, chilesotti, including, eight, pieces, from, a, german, manuscript, da, un, codice, lauten, buch, now, in, a, private, library, in, northern, italy, the, revival, of, lute, playing, in, the, 20th, century, has, its, roots, in, the, pioneering, work, of, arnold, dolmetsch, 1858, 1940, whose, research, into, early, music, and, instruments, started, the, movement, for, authenticity, the, revival, of, the, lute, gave, composers, an, opportunity, to, create, new, works, for, it, one, of, the, first, such, composers, was, johann, nepomuk, david, in, germany, composer, vladimir, vavilov, was, a, pioneer, of, the, lute, revival, in, the, ussr, he, was, also, the, author, of, numerous, musical, hoaxes, sandor, kallos, and, toyohiko, satoh, applied, modernist, idiom, to, the, lute, elena, kats, chernin, jozef, van, wissem, and, alexandre, danilevsky, minimalist, and, post, minimalist, idiom, roman, turovsky, savchuk, paulo, galv, o, robert, mackillop, historicist, idiom, and, ronn, mcfarlane, new, age, this, active, movement, by, early, music, specialists, has, inspired, composers, in, different, fields, for, example, in, 1980, akira, ifukube, a, classical, and, film, composer, best, known, for, the, godzilla, s, theme, wrote, the, fantasia, for, baroque, lute, with, the, historical, tablature, notation, rather, than, the, modern, staff, one, lutes, were, made, in, a, large, variety, of, sizes, with, varying, numbers, of, strings, courses, and, with, no, permanent, standard, for, tuning, however, the, following, seems, to, have, been, generally, true, of, the, renaissance, lute, a, 6, course, renaissance, tenor, lute, would, be, tuned, to, the, same, intervals, as, a, tenor, viol, with, intervals, of, a, perfect, fourth, between, all, the, courses, except, the, third, and, fourth, which, differed, only, by, a, major, third, the, tenor, lute, was, usually, tuned, nominally, in, g, there, was, no, pitch, standard, before, the, 20th, century, named, after, the, pitch, of, the, highest, course, yielding, the, pattern, g, g, cc, ff, aa, dd, g, from, the, lowest, course, to, the, highest, much, renaissance, lute, music, can, be, played, on, a, guitar, by, tuning, the, guitar, s, third, string, down, by, a, half, tone, for, lutes, with, more, than, six, courses, the, extra, courses, would, be, added, on, the, low, end, because, of, the, large, number, of, strings, lutes, have, very, wide, necks, and, it, is, difficult, to, stop, strings, beyond, the, sixth, course, so, additional, courses, were, usually, tuned, to, pitches, useful, as, bass, notes, rather, than, continuing, the, regular, pattern, of, fourths, and, these, lower, courses, are, most, often, played, without, stopping, thus, an, 8, course, tenor, renaissance, lute, would, be, tuned, to, d, d, f, f, g, g, cc, ff, aa, dd, g, and, a, 10, course, to, c, c, d, d, e, e, f, f, g, g, cc, ff, aa, dd, g, however, none, of, these, patterns, were, de, rigueur, and, a, modern, lutenist, occasionally, retunes, one, or, more, courses, between, pieces, manuscripts, bear, instructions, for, the, player, e, g, 7, e, ch, ur, en, fa, seventh, course, in, fa, f, in, the, standard, c, scale, the, early, 17th, century, was, a, period, of, considerable, development, for, the, lute, particularly, with, new, tuning, schemes, developed, in, france, at, this, time, french, lutenists, began, to, explore, the, expressive, capabilities, of, the, lute, through, experimentation, in, tuning, schemes, on, the, instrument, today, these, tunings, are, often, labeled, as, transitional, tunings, or, accords, nouveaux, french, new, tunings, transitional, tunings, document, the, transition, from, the, established, renaissance, lute, tuning, to, the, later, established, baroque, d, minor, tuning, scheme, this, development, in, tuning, is, credited, to, french, lutenists, of, the, early, 17th, century, who, began, increasing, the, number, of, major, or, minor, thirds, on, the, adjacent, open, strings, of, the, 10, course, lute, as, a, result, the, french, lutenist, found, a, more, sonorous, sound, and, increased, sympathetic, vibration, on, the, instrument, this, led, to, new, compositional, styles, and, playing, techniques, on, the, instrument, most, notably, the, style, bris, french, broken, style, manuscript, sources, from, the, first, half, of, the, 17th, century, provide, evidence, that, french, transitional, tunings, gained, popularity, and, were, adopted, across, much, of, continental, europe, the, most, used, transitional, tunings, during, this, time, were, known, as, the, sharp, and, flat, tunings, read, from, the, tenth, to, the, first, course, on, a, 10, course, lute, the, sharp, tuning, reads, c, d, e, f, g, c, f, a, c, e, the, flat, tuning, reads, c, db, eb, f, g, c, f, ab, c, eb, however, by, around, 1670, the, scheme, known, today, as, the, baroque, or, d, minor, tuning, became, the, norm, at, least, in, france, and, in, northern, and, central, europe, in, this, case, the, first, six, courses, outline, a, d, minor, triad, and, an, additional, five, to, seven, courses, are, tuned, generally, scalewise, below, them, thus, the, 13, course, lute, played, by, composer, sylvius, leopold, weiss, would, have, been, tuned, a, a, b, b, c, c, d, d, e, e, f, f, g, g, a, a, dd, ff, aa, d, f, or, with, sharps, or, flats, on, the, lower, 7, courses, appropriate, to, the, key, of, the, piece, modern, lutenists, tune, to, a, variety, of, pitch, standards, ranging, from, a, 392, to, 470, hz, depending, on, the, type, of, instrument, they, are, playing, the, repertory, the, pitch, of, other, instruments, in, an, ensemble, and, other, performing, expediencies, no, attempt, at, a, universal, pitch, standard,
