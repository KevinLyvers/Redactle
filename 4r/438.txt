learning, to, perform, magic, can, join, magic, clubs, here, magicians, both, seasoned, and, novitiate, can, work, together, and, help, one, another, for, mutual, improvement, to, learn, new, techniques, to, discuss, all, aspects, of, magic, to, perform, for, each, other, sharing, advice, encouragement, and, criticism, before, a, magician, can, join, one, of, these, clubs, they, usually,

illusion, that, the, magician, can, read, minds, comedy, magic, is, the, use, of, magic, combined, with, stand, up, comedy, an, example, being, penn, teller, some, modern, illusionists, believe, that, it, is, unethical, to, give, a, performance, that, claims, to, be, anything, other, than, a, clever, and, skillful, deception, others, argue, that, they, can, claim, that, the, effects, are, due, to,

believe, that, it, is, unethical, to, give, a, performance, that, claims, to, be, anything, other, than, a, clever, and, skillful, deception, most, of, these, performers, therefore, eschew, the, term, magician, which, they, view, as, making, a, claim, to, supernatural, power, in, favor, of, illusionist, and, similar, descriptions, for, example, the, performer, jamy, ian, swiss, makes, these, points, by, billing, himself, as, an, honest, liar, alternatively, many, performers, say, that, magical, acts, as, a, form, of, theatre, need, no, more, of, a, disclaimer, than, any, play, or, film, this, policy, was, advocated, by, the, magician, and, mentalist, joseph, dunninger, who, stated, for, those, who, believe, no, explanation, is, necessary, for, those, who, do, not, believe, no, explanation, will, suffice, these, apparently, irreconcilable, differences, of, opinion, have, led, to, some, conflicts, among, performers, for, example, more, than, thirty, years, after, the, illusionist, uri, geller, made, his, first, appearances, on, television, in, the, 1970s, to, exhibit, his, self, proclaimed, psychic, ability, to, bend, spoons, his, actions, still, provoke, controversy, among, some, magic, performers, because, he, claimed, what, he, did, was, not, an, illusion, on, the, other, hand, because, geller, bent, and, continues, to, bend, spoons, within, a, performance, context, and, has, lectured, at, several, magic, conventions, the, dunninger, quote, may, be, said, to, apply, in, 2016, self, proclaimed, psychic, the, amazing, kreskin, was, barred,

cards, is, the, queen, another, example, is, the, shell, game, in, which, a, pea, is, hidden, under, one, of, three, walnut, shells, then, shuffled, around, the, table, or, sidewalk, so, slowly, as, to, make, the, pea, s, position, seemingly, obvious, although, these, are, well, known, as, frauds, people, still, lose, money, on, them, a, shell, game, ring, was, broken, up, in, los, angeles, as,

the, mid, 19th, to, mid, 20th, centuries, many, performances, and, performers, can, be, followed, through, newspapers, of, the, time, many, books, have, been, written, about, magic, tricks, so, many, are, written, every, year, that, at, least, one, magic, author, has, suggested, that, more, books, are, written, about, magic, than, any, other, performing, art, although, the, bulk, of, these, books,
