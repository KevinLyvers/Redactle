plucked, in, musical, instrument, classification, string, instruments, or, chordophones, are, musical, instruments, that, produce, sound, from, vibrating, strings, when, a, performer, plays, or, sounds, the, strings, in, some, manner, musicians, play, some, string, instruments, like, guitars, by, plucking, the, strings, with, their, fingers, or, a, plectrum, pick, and, others, by, hitting, the, strings, with, a, light, wooden, hammer, or, by, rubbing, the, strings, with, a, bow, like, violins, in, some, keyboard, instruments, such, as, the, harpsichord, the, musician, presses, a, key, that, plucks, the, string, other, musical, instruments, generate, sound, by, striking, the, string, with, bowed, instruments, the, player, pulls, a, rosined, horsehair, bow, across, the, strings, causing, them, to, vibrate, with, a, hurdy, gurdy, the, musician, cranks, a, wheel, whose, rosined, edge, touches, the, strings, bowed, instruments, include, the, string, section, instruments, of, the, orchestra, in, western, classical, music, violin, viola, cello, and, double, bass, and, a, number, of, other, instruments, e, g, viols, and, gambas, used, in, early, music, from, the, baroque, music, era, and, fiddles, used, in, many, types, of, folk, music, all, of, the, bowed, string, instruments, can, also, be, plucked, with, the, fingers, a, technique, called, pizzicato, a, wide, variety, of, techniques, are, used, to, sound, notes, on, the, electric, guitar, including, plucking, with, the, fingernails, or, a, plectrum, strumming, and, even, tapping, on, the, fingerboard, and, using, feedback, from, a, loud, distorted, guitar, amplifier, to, produce, a, sustained, sound, some, string, instruments, are, mainly, plucked, such, as, the, harp, and, the, electric, bass, other, examples, include, the, sitar, rebab, banjo, mandolin, ukulele, and, bouzouki, in, the, hornbostel, sachs, scheme, of, musical, instrument, classification, used, in, organology, string, instruments, are, called, chordophones, according, to, sachs, chordophones, are, instruments, with, strings, the, strings, may, be, struck, with, sticks, plucked, with, the, bare, fingers, or, a, plectrum, bowed, or, in, the, aeolian, harp, for, instance, sounded, by, wind, the, confusing, plenitude, of, stringed, instruments, can, be, reduced, to, four, fundamental, type, zithers, lutes, lyres, and, harps, in, most, string, instruments, the, vibrations, are, transmitted, to, the, body, of, the, instrument, which, often, incorporates, some, sort, of, hollow, or, enclosed, area, the, body, of, the, instrument, also, vibrates, along, with, the, air, inside, it, the, vibration, of, the, body, of, the, instrument, and, the, enclosed, hollow, or, chamber, make, the, vibration, of, the, string, more, audible, to, the, performer, and, audience, the, body, of, most, string, instruments, is, hollow, in, order, to, have, better, sound, projection, some, however, such, as, electric, guitar, and, other, instruments, that, rely, on, electronic, amplification, may, have, a, solid, wood, body, in, musicology, string, instruments, are, known, as, chordophones, it, is, one, of, the, five, main, divisions, of, instruments, in, the, hornbostel, sachs, scheme, of, musical, instrument, classification, hornbostel, sachs, divides, chordophones, into, two, main, groups, instruments, without, a, resonator, as, an, integral, part, of, the, instrument, which, have, the, classification, number, 31, also, known, as, simple, and, instruments, with, such, a, resonator, which, have, the, classification, number, 32, also, known, as, composite, most, western, instruments, fall, into, the, second, group, but, the, piano, and, harpsichord, fall, into, the, first, hornbostel, and, sachs, criterion, for, determining, which, sub, group, an, instrument, falls, into, is, that, if, the, resonator, can, be, removed, without, destroying, the, instrument, then, it, is, classified, as, 31, the, idea, that, the, piano, s, casing, which, acts, as, a, resonator, could, be, removed, without, destroying, the, instrument, may, seem, odd, but, if, the, action, and, strings, of, the, piano, were, taken, out, of, its, box, it, could, still, be, played, this, is, not, true, of, the, violin, because, the, string, passes, over, a, bridge, located, on, the, resonator, box, so, removing, the, resonator, would, mean, the, strings, had, no, tension, curt, sachs, also, broke, chordophones, into, four, basic, subcategories, zithers, lutes, lyres, and, harps, dating, to, around, c, 13, 000, bc, a, cave, painting, in, the, trois, fr, res, cave, in, france, depicts, what, some, believe, is, a, musical, bow, a, hunting, bow, used, as, a, single, stringed, musical, instrument, from, the, musical, bow, families, of, stringed, instruments, developed, since, each, string, played, a, single, note, adding, strings, added, new, notes, creating, bow, harps, harps, and, lyres, in, turn, this, led, to, being, able, to, play, dyads, and, chords, another, innovation, occurred, when, the, bow, harp, was, straightened, out, and, a, bridge, used, to, lift, the, strings, off, the, stick, neck, creating, the, lute, this, picture, of, musical, bow, to, harp, bow, is, theory, and, has, been, contested, in, 1965, franz, jahnel, wrote, his, criticism, stating, that, the, early, ancestors, of, plucked, instruments, are, not, currently, known, he, felt, that, the, harp, bow, was, a, long, cry, from, the, sophistication, of, the, civilizations, of, western, asia, in, 4000, bc, that, took, the, primitive, technology, and, created, technically, and, artistically, well, made, harps, lyres, citharas, and, lutes, archaeological, digs, have, identified, some, of, the, earliest, stringed, instruments, in, ancient, mesopotamian, sites, like, the, lyres, of, ur, which, include, artifacts, over, three, thousand, years, old, the, development, of, lyre, instruments, required, the, technology, to, create, a, tuning, mechanism, to, tighten, and, loosen, the, string, tension, lyres, with, wooden, bodies, and, strings, used, for, plucking, or, playing, with, a, bow, represent, key, instruments, that, point, towards, later, harps, and, violin, type, instruments, moreover, indian, instruments, from, 500, bc, have, been, discovered, with, anything, from, 7, to, 21, strings, in, vietnam, a, 2, 000, year, old, singularly, stringed, instrument, made, of, deer, antler, was, also, discovered, musicologists, have, put, forth, examples, of, that, 4th, century, bc, technology, looking, at, engraved, images, that, have, survived, the, earliest, image, showing, a, lute, like, instrument, came, from, mesopotamia, prior, to, 3000, bc, a, cylinder, seal, from, c, 3100, bc, or, earlier, now, in, the, possession, of, the, british, museum, shows, what, is, thought, to, be, a, woman, playing, a, stick, lute, from, the, surviving, images, theorists, have, categorized, the, mesopotamian, lutes, showing, that, they, developed, into, a, long, variety, and, a, short, the, line, of, long, lutes, may, have, developed, into, the, tamburs, and, pandura, the, line, of, short, lutes, was, further, developed, to, the, east, of, mesopotamia, in, bactria, gandhara, and, northwest, india, and, shown, in, sculpture, from, the, 2nd, century, bc, through, the, 4th, or, 5th, centuries, ad, during, the, medieval, era, instrument, development, varied, in, different, regions, of, the, world, middle, eastern, rebecs, represented, breakthroughs, in, terms, of, shape, and, strings, with, a, half, a, pear, shape, using, three, strings, early, versions, of, the, violin, and, fiddle, by, comparison, emerged, in, europe, through, instruments, such, as, the, gittern, a, four, stringed, precursor, to, the, guitar, and, basic, lutes, these, instruments, typically, used, catgut, animal, intestine, and, other, materials, including, silk, for, their, strings, string, instrument, design, was, refined, during, the, renaissance, and, into, the, baroque, period, 1600, 1750, of, musical, history, violins, and, guitars, became, more, consistent, in, design, and, were, roughly, similar, to, acoustic, guitars, of, the, 2000s, the, violins, of, the, renaissance, featured, intricate, woodwork, and, stringing, while, more, elaborate, bass, instruments, such, as, the, bandora, were, produced, alongside, quill, plucked, citterns, and, spanish, body, guitars, in, the, 19th, century, string, instruments, were, made, more, widely, available, through, mass, production, with, wood, string, instruments, a, key, part, of, orchestras, cellos, violas, and, upright, basses, for, example, were, now, standard, instruments, for, chamber, ensembles, and, smaller, orchestras, at, the, same, time, the, 19th, century, guitar, became, more, typically, associated, with, six, string, models, rather, than, traditional, five, string, versions, major, changes, to, string, instruments, in, the, 20th, century, primarily, involved, innovations, in, electronic, instrument, amplification, and, electronic, music, electric, violins, were, available, by, the, 1920s, and, were, an, important, part, of, emerging, jazz, music, trends, in, the, united, states, the, acoustic, guitar, was, widely, used, in, blues, and, jazz, but, as, an, acoustic, instrument, it, was, not, loud, enough, to, be, a, solo, instrument, so, these, genres, mostly, used, it, as, an, accompaniment, rhythm, section, instrument, in, big, bands, of, the, 1920s, the, acoustic, guitar, played, backing, chords, but, it, was, not, loud, enough, to, play, solos, like, the, saxophone, and, trumpet, the, development, of, guitar, amplifiers, which, contained, a, power, amplifier, and, a, loudspeaker, in, a, wooden, cabinet, let, jazz, guitarists, play, solos, and, be, heard, over, a, big, band, the, development, of, the, electric, guitar, provided, guitarists, with, an, instrument, that, was, built, to, connect, to, guitar, amplifiers, electric, guitars, have, magnetic, pickups, volume, control, knobs, and, an, output, jack, in, the, 1960s, larger, more, powerful, guitar, amplifiers, were, developed, called, stacks, these, powerful, amplifiers, enabled, guitarists, to, perform, in, rock, bands, that, played, in, large, venues, such, as, stadiums, and, outdoor, music, festivals, e, g, woodstock, music, festival, along, with, the, development, of, guitar, amplifiers, a, large, range, of, electronic, effects, units, many, in, small, stompbox, pedals, were, introduced, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, such, as, fuzz, pedals, flangers, and, phasers, enabling, performers, to, create, unique, new, sounds, during, the, psychedelic, rock, era, breakthroughs, in, electric, guitar, and, basses, technologies, and, playing, styles, enabled, major, breakthroughs, in, pop, and, rock, music, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, the, distinctive, sound, of, the, amplified, electric, guitar, was, the, centerpiece, of, new, genres, of, music, such, as, blues, rock, and, jazz, rock, fusion, the, sonic, power, of, the, loudly, amplified, highly, distorted, electric, guitar, was, the, key, element, of, the, early, heavy, metal, music, with, the, distorted, guitar, being, used, in, lead, guitar, roles, and, with, power, chords, as, a, rhythm, guitar, the, ongoing, use, of, electronic, amplification, and, effects, units, in, string, instruments, ranging, from, traditional, instruments, like, the, violin, to, the, new, electric, guitar, added, variety, to, contemporary, classical, music, performances, and, enabled, experimentation, in, the, dynamic, and, timbre, tone, colour, range, of, orchestras, bands, and, solo, performances, string, instruments, can, be, divided, into, three, groups, it, is, also, possible, to, divide, the, instruments, into, categories, focused, on, how, the, instrument, is, played, all, string, instruments, produce, sound, from, one, or, more, vibrating, strings, transferred, to, the, air, by, the, body, of, the, instrument, or, by, a, pickup, in, the, case, of, electronically, amplified, instruments, they, are, usually, categorised, by, the, technique, used, to, make, the, strings, vibrate, or, by, the, primary, technique, in, the, case, of, instruments, where, more, than, one, may, apply, the, three, most, common, techniques, are, plucking, bowing, and, striking, an, important, difference, between, bowing, and, plucking, is, that, in, the, former, the, phenomenon, is, periodic, so, that, the, overtones, are, kept, in, a, strictly, harmonic, relationship, to, the, fundamental, plucking, is, a, method, of, playing, on, instruments, such, as, the, veena, banjo, ukulele, guitar, harp, lute, mandolin, oud, and, sitar, using, either, a, finger, thumb, or, quills, now, plastic, plectra, to, pluck, the, strings, instruments, normally, played, by, bowing, see, below, may, also, be, plucked, a, technique, referred, to, by, the, italian, term, pizzicato, bowing, italian, arco, is, a, method, used, in, some, string, instruments, including, the, violin, viola, cello, and, the, double, bass, of, the, violin, family, and, the, old, viol, family, the, bow, consists, of, a, stick, with, a, ribbon, of, parallel, horse, tail, hairs, stretched, between, its, ends, the, hair, is, coated, with, rosin, so, it, can, grip, the, string, moving, the, hair, across, a, string, causes, a, stick, slip, phenomenon, making, the, string, vibrate, and, prompting, the, instrument, to, emit, sound, darker, grades, of, rosin, grip, well, in, cool, dry, climates, but, may, be, too, sticky, in, warmer, more, humid, weather, violin, and, viola, players, generally, use, harder, lighter, colored, rosin, than, players, of, lower, pitched, instruments, who, tend, to, favor, darker, softer, rosin, the, ravanahatha, is, one, of, the, oldest, string, instruments, ancestors, of, the, modern, bowed, string, instruments, are, the, rebab, of, the, islamic, empires, the, persian, kamanche, and, the, byzantine, lira, other, bowed, instruments, are, the, rebec, hardingfele, nyckelharpa, koky, erhu, igil, sarangi, morin, khuur, and, k, ni, the, hurdy, gurdy, is, bowed, by, a, wheel, rarely, the, guitar, has, been, played, with, a, bow, rather, than, plucked, for, unique, effects, the, third, common, method, of, sound, production, in, stringed, instruments, is, to, strike, the, string, the, piano, and, hammered, dulcimer, use, this, method, of, sound, production, even, though, the, piano, strikes, the, strings, the, use, of, felt, hammers, means, that, the, sound, that, is, produced, can, nevertheless, be, mellow, and, rounded, in, contrast, to, the, sharp, attack, produced, when, a, very, hard, hammer, strikes, the, strings, violin, family, string, instrument, players, are, occasionally, instructed, to, strike, the, string, with, the, stick, of, the, bow, a, technique, called, col, legno, this, yields, a, percussive, sound, along, with, the, pitch, of, the, note, a, well, known, use, of, col, legno, for, orchestral, strings, is, gustav, holst, s, mars, movement, from, the, planets, suite, the, aeolian, harp, employs, a, very, unusual, method, of, sound, production, the, strings, are, excited, by, the, movement, of, the, air, some, instruments, that, have, strings, have, an, attached, keyboard, that, the, player, presses, keys, on, to, trigger, a, mechanism, that, sounds, the, strings, instead, of, directly, manipulating, the, strings, these, include, the, piano, the, clavichord, and, the, harpsichord, with, these, keyboard, instruments, strings, are, occasionally, plucked, or, bowed, by, hand, modern, composers, such, as, henry, cowell, wrote, music, that, requires, that, the, player, reach, inside, the, piano, and, pluck, the, strings, directly, bow, them, with, bow, hair, wrapped, around, the, strings, or, play, them, by, rolling, the, bell, of, a, brass, instrument, such, as, a, trombone, on, the, array, of, strings, however, these, are, relatively, rarely, used, special, techniques, other, keyed, string, instruments, small, enough, for, a, strolling, musician, to, play, include, the, plucked, autoharp, the, bowed, nyckelharpa, and, the, hurdy, gurdy, which, is, played, by, cranking, a, rosined, wheel, steel, stringed, instruments, such, as, the, guitar, bass, violin, etc, can, be, played, using, a, magnetic, field, an, e, bow, is, a, small, hand, held, battery, powered, device, that, magnetically, excites, the, strings, of, an, electric, string, instrument, to, provide, a, sustained, singing, tone, reminiscent, of, a, held, bowed, violin, note, third, bridge, is, a, plucking, method, where, the, player, frets, a, string, and, strikes, the, side, opposite, the, bridge, the, technique, is, mainly, used, on, electric, instruments, because, these, have, a, pickup, that, amplifies, only, the, local, string, vibration, it, is, possible, on, acoustic, instruments, as, well, but, less, effective, for, instance, a, player, might, press, on, the, seventh, fret, on, a, guitar, and, pluck, it, at, the, head, side, to, make, a, tone, resonate, at, the, opposing, side, on, electric, instruments, this, technique, generates, multitone, sounds, reminiscent, of, a, clock, or, bell, electric, string, instruments, such, as, the, electric, guitar, can, also, be, played, without, touching, the, strings, by, using, audio, feedback, when, an, electric, guitar, is, plugged, into, a, loud, powerful, guitar, amplifier, with, a, loudspeaker, and, a, high, level, of, distortion, is, intentionally, used, the, guitar, produces, sustained, high, pitched, sounds, by, changing, the, proximity, of, the, guitar, to, the, speaker, the, guitarist, can, produce, sounds, that, cannot, be, produced, with, standard, plucking, and, picking, techniques, this, technique, was, popularized, by, jimi, hendrix, and, others, in, the, 1960s, it, was, widely, used, in, psychedelic, rock, and, heavy, metal, music, there, are, three, ways, to, change, the, pitch, of, a, vibrating, string, string, instruments, are, tuned, by, varying, a, string, s, tension, because, adjusting, length, or, mass, per, unit, length, is, impractical, instruments, with, a, fingerboard, are, then, played, by, adjusting, the, length, of, the, vibrating, portion, of, the, strings, the, following, observations, all, apply, to, a, string, that, is, infinitely, flexible, a, theoretical, assumption, because, in, practical, applications, strings, are, not, infinitely, flexible, strung, between, two, fixed, supports, real, strings, have, finite, curvature, at, the, bridge, and, nut, and, the, bridge, because, of, its, motion, is, not, exactly, nodes, of, vibration, hence, the, following, statements, about, proportionality, are, approximations, pitch, can, be, adjusted, by, varying, the, length, of, the, string, a, longer, string, results, in, a, lower, pitch, while, a, shorter, string, results, in, a, higher, pitch, a, concert, harp, has, pedals, that, cause, a, hard, object, to, make, contact, with, a, string, to, shorten, its, vibrating, length, during, a, performance, the, frequency, is, inversely, proportional, to, the, length, a, string, twice, as, long, produces, a, tone, of, half, the, frequency, one, octave, lower, pitch, can, be, adjusted, by, varying, the, tension, of, the, string, a, string, with, less, tension, looser, results, in, a, lower, pitch, while, a, string, with, greater, tension, tighter, results, in, a, higher, pitch, pushing, a, pedal, on, a, pedal, steel, guitar, raises, the, pitch, of, certain, strings, by, increasing, tension, on, them, stretching, through, a, mechanical, linkage, release, of, the, pedal, returns, the, pitch, to, the, original, knee, levers, on, the, instrument, can, lower, a, pitch, by, releasing, and, restoring, tension, in, the, same, way, a, homemade, washtub, bass, made, out, of, a, length, of, rope, a, broomstick, and, a, washtub, can, produce, different, pitches, by, increasing, the, tension, on, the, rope, producing, a, higher, pitch, or, reducing, the, tension, producing, a, lower, pitch, the, frequency, is, proportional, to, the, square, root, of, the, tension, the, pitch, of, a, string, can, also, be, varied, by, changing, the, linear, density, mass, per, unit, length, of, the, string, in, practical, applications, such, as, with, double, bass, strings, or, bass, piano, strings, extra, weight, is, added, to, strings, by, winding, them, with, metal, a, string, with, a, heavier, metal, winding, produces, a, lower, pitch, than, a, string, of, equal, length, without, a, metal, winding, this, can, be, seen, on, a, 2016, era, set, of, gut, strings, for, double, bass, the, higher, pitched, g, string, is, often, made, of, synthetic, material, or, sometimes, animal, intestine, with, no, metal, wrapping, to, enable, the, low, e, string, to, produce, a, much, lower, pitch, with, a, string, of, the, same, length, it, is, wrapped, with, many, wrappings, of, thin, metal, wire, this, adds, to, its, mass, without, making, it, too, stiff, the, frequency, is, inversely, proportional, to, the, square, root, of, the, linear, density, given, two, strings, of, equal, length, and, tension, the, string, with, higher, mass, per, unit, length, produces, the, lower, pitch, the, length, of, the, string, from, nut, to, bridge, on, bowed, or, plucked, instruments, ultimately, determines, the, distance, between, different, notes, on, the, instrument, for, example, a, double, bass, with, its, low, range, needs, a, scale, length, of, around, 42, inches, 110, cm, whilst, a, violin, scale, is, only, about, 13, inches, 33, cm, on, the, shorter, scale, of, the, violin, the, left, hand, may, easily, reach, a, range, of, slightly, more, than, two, octaves, without, shifting, position, while, on, the, bass, longer, scale, a, single, octave, or, a, ninth, is, reachable, in, lower, positions, in, bowed, instruments, the, bow, is, normally, placed, perpendicularly, to, the, string, at, a, point, halfway, between, the, end, of, the, fingerboard, and, the, bridge, however, different, bow, placements, can, be, selected, to, change, timbre, application, of, the, bow, close, to, the, bridge, known, as, sul, ponticello, produces, an, intense, sometimes, harsh, sound, which, acoustically, emphasizes, the, upper, harmonics, bowing, above, the, fingerboard, sul, tasto, produces, a, purer, tone, with, less, overtone, strength, emphasizing, the, fundamental, also, known, as, flautando, since, it, sounds, less, reedy, and, more, flute, like, bowed, instruments, pose, a, challenge, to, instrument, builders, as, compared, with, instruments, that, are, only, plucked, e, g, guitar, because, on, bowed, instruments, the, musician, must, be, able, to, play, one, string, at, a, time, if, they, wish, as, such, a, bowed, instrument, must, have, a, curved, bridge, that, makes, the, outer, strings, lower, in, height, than, the, inner, strings, with, such, a, curved, bridge, the, player, can, select, one, string, at, a, time, to, play, on, guitars, and, lutes, the, bridge, can, be, flat, because, the, strings, are, played, by, plucking, them, with, the, fingers, fingernails, or, a, pick, by, moving, the, fingers, or, pick, to, different, positions, the, player, can, play, different, strings, on, bowed, instruments, the, need, to, play, strings, individually, with, the, bow, also, limits, the, number, of, strings, to, about, six, or, seven, strings, with, more, strings, it, would, be, impossible, to, select, individual, strings, to, bow, note, bowed, strings, can, also, play, two, bowed, notes, on, two, different, strings, at, the, same, time, a, technique, called, a, double, stop, indeed, on, the, orchestral, string, section, instruments, four, strings, are, the, norm, with, the, exception, of, five, strings, used, on, some, double, basses, in, contrast, with, stringed, keyboard, instruments, 88, courses, are, used, on, a, piano, and, even, though, these, strings, are, arranged, on, a, flat, bridge, the, mechanism, can, play, any, of, the, notes, individually, similar, timbral, distinctions, are, also, possible, with, plucked, string, instruments, by, selecting, an, appropriate, plucking, point, although, the, difference, is, perhaps, more, subtle, in, keyboard, instruments, the, contact, point, along, the, string, whether, this, be, hammer, tangent, or, plectrum, is, a, choice, made, by, the, instrument, designer, builders, use, a, combination, of, experience, and, acoustic, theory, to, establish, the, right, set, of, contact, points, in, harpsichords, often, there, are, two, sets, of, strings, of, equal, length, these, choirs, usually, differ, in, their, plucking, points, one, choir, has, a, normal, plucking, point, producing, a, canonical, harpsichord, sound, the, other, has, a, plucking, point, close, to, the, bridge, producing, a, reedier, nasal, sound, rich, in, upper, harmonics, a, single, string, at, a, certain, tension, and, length, only, produces, one, note, to, produce, multiple, notes, string, instruments, use, one, of, two, methods, one, is, to, add, enough, strings, to, cover, the, required, range, of, different, notes, e, g, as, with, the, piano, which, has, sets, of, 88, strings, to, enable, the, performer, to, play, 88, different, notes, the, other, is, to, provide, a, way, to, stop, the, strings, along, their, length, to, shorten, the, part, that, vibrates, which, is, the, method, used, in, guitar, and, violin, family, instruments, to, produce, different, notes, from, the, same, string, the, piano, and, harp, represent, the, first, method, where, each, note, on, the, instrument, has, its, own, string, or, course, of, multiple, strings, tuned, to, the, same, note, many, notes, on, a, piano, are, strung, with, a, choir, of, three, strings, tuned, alike, to, increase, the, volume, a, guitar, represents, the, second, method, the, player, s, fingers, push, the, string, against, the, fingerboard, so, that, the, string, is, pressed, firmly, against, a, metal, fret, pressing, the, string, against, a, fret, while, plucking, or, strumming, it, shortens, the, vibrating, part, and, thus, produces, a, different, note, some, zithers, combine, stoppable, melody, strings, with, a, greater, number, of, open, harmony, or, chord, strings, on, instruments, with, stoppable, strings, such, as, the, violin, or, guitar, the, player, can, shorten, the, vibrating, length, of, the, string, using, their, fingers, directly, or, more, rarely, through, some, mechanical, device, as, in, the, nyckelharpa, and, the, hurdy, gurdy, such, instruments, usually, have, a, fingerboard, attached, to, the, neck, of, the, instrument, that, provides, a, hard, flat, surface, the, player, can, stop, the, strings, against, on, some, string, instruments, the, fingerboard, has, frets, raised, ridges, perpendicular, to, the, strings, that, stop, the, string, at, precise, intervals, in, which, case, the, fingerboard, is, also, called, a, fretboard, moving, frets, during, performance, is, usually, impractical, the, bridges, of, a, koto, on, the, other, hand, may, be, moved, by, the, player, occasionally, in, the, course, of, a, single, piece, of, music, many, modern, western, harps, include, levers, either, directly, moved, by, fingers, on, celtic, harps, or, controlled, by, foot, pedals, on, orchestral, harps, to, raise, the, pitch, of, individual, strings, by, a, fixed, amount, the, middle, eastern, zither, the, qanun, is, equipped, with, small, levers, called, mandal, that, let, each, course, of, multiple, strings, be, incrementally, retuned, on, the, fly, while, the, instrument, is, being, played, these, levers, raise, or, lower, the, pitch, of, the, string, course, by, a, microtone, less, than, a, half, step, some, instruments, are, employed, with, sympathetic, strings, which, are, additional, strings, not, meant, to, be, plucked, these, strings, resonate, with, the, played, notes, creating, additional, tones, sympathetic, strings, vibrate, naturally, when, various, intervals, such, as, the, unisons, or, the, octaves, of, the, notes, of, the, sympathetic, strings, are, plucked, bowed, or, struck, this, system, is, used, on, the, sarangi, the, grand, piano, the, hardanger, fiddle, and, the, rubab, a, vibrating, string, strung, on, a, very, thick, log, as, a, hypothetical, example, would, make, only, a, very, quiet, sound, so, string, instruments, are, usually, constructed, in, such, a, way, that, the, vibrating, string, is, coupled, to, a, hollow, resonating, chamber, a, soundboard, or, both, on, the, violin, for, example, the, four, strings, pass, over, a, thin, wooden, bridge, resting, on, a, hollow, box, the, body, of, the, violin, the, normal, force, applied, to, the, body, from, the, strings, is, supported, in, part, by, a, small, cylinder, of, wood, called, the, soundpost, the, violin, body, also, has, two, f, holes, carved, on, the, top, the, strings, vibrations, are, distributed, via, the, bridge, and, soundpost, to, all, surfaces, of, the, instrument, and, are, thus, made, louder, by, matching, of, the, acoustic, impedance, the, correct, technical, explanation, is, that, they, allow, a, better, match, to, the, acoustic, impedance, of, the, air, it, is, sometimes, said, that, the, sounding, board, or, soundbox, amplifies, the, sound, of, the, strings, in, reality, no, power, amplification, occurs, because, all, of, the, energy, to, produce, sound, comes, from, the, vibrating, string, the, mechanism, is, that, the, sounding, board, of, the, instrument, provides, a, larger, surface, area, to, create, sound, waves, than, that, of, the, string, and, therefore, acts, as, a, matching, element, between, the, acoustic, impedance, of, the, string, and, that, of, the, surrounding, air, a, larger, vibrating, surface, can, sometimes, produce, better, matching, especially, at, lower, frequencies, all, lute, type, instruments, traditionally, have, a, bridge, which, holds, the, string, at, the, proper, action, height, from, the, fret, finger, board, at, one, end, of, the, strings, on, acoustic, instruments, the, bridge, performs, an, equally, important, function, of, transmitting, string, energy, into, the, sound, box, of, the, instrument, thereby, increasing, the, sound, volume, the, specific, design, and, materials, used, in, the, construction, of, the, bridge, of, an, instrument, have, a, dramatic, impact, upon, both, the, sound, and, responsiveness, of, the, instrument, achieving, a, tonal, characteristic, that, is, effective, and, pleasing, to, the, player, s, and, listener, s, ear, is, something, of, an, art, and, craft, as, well, as, a, science, and, the, makers, of, string, instruments, often, seek, very, high, quality, woods, to, this, end, particularly, spruce, chosen, for, its, lightness, strength, and, flexibility, and, maple, a, very, hard, wood, spruce, is, used, for, the, sounding, boards, of, instruments, from, the, violin, to, the, piano, instruments, such, as, the, banjo, use, a, drum, covered, in, natural, or, synthetic, skin, as, their, soundboard, acoustic, instruments, can, also, be, made, out, of, artificial, materials, such, as, carbon, fiber, and, fiberglass, particularly, the, larger, lower, pitched, instruments, such, as, cellos, and, basses, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, stroh, violin, used, a, diaphragm, type, resonator, and, a, metal, horn, to, project, the, string, sound, much, like, early, mechanical, gramophones, its, use, declined, beginning, about, 1920, as, electronic, amplification, through, power, amplifiers, and, loudspeakers, was, developed, and, came, into, use, string, instrument, players, can, electronically, amplify, their, instruments, by, connecting, them, to, a, pa, system, or, a, guitar, amplifier, most, string, instruments, can, be, fitted, with, piezoelectric, or, magnetic, pickups, to, convert, the, string, s, vibrations, into, an, electrical, signal, that, is, amplified, and, then, converted, back, into, sound, by, loudspeakers, some, players, attach, a, pickup, to, their, traditional, string, instrument, to, electrify, it, another, option, is, to, use, a, solid, bodied, instrument, which, reduces, unwanted, feedback, howls, or, squeals, amplified, string, instruments, can, be, much, louder, than, their, acoustic, counterparts, so, musicians, can, play, them, in, relatively, loud, rock, blues, and, jazz, ensembles, amplified, instruments, can, also, have, their, amplified, tone, modified, by, using, electronic, effects, such, as, distortion, reverb, or, wah, wah, bass, register, string, instruments, such, as, the, double, bass, and, the, electric, bass, are, amplified, with, bass, instrument, amplifiers, that, are, designed, to, reproduce, low, frequency, sounds, to, modify, the, tone, of, amplified, bass, instruments, a, range, of, electronic, bass, effects, are, available, such, as, distortion, and, chorus, the, string, instruments, usually, used, in, the, orchestra, and, often, called, the, symphonic, strings, or, string, section, are, when, orchestral, instrumentation, specifies, strings, it, often, means, this, combination, of, string, parts, orchestral, works, rarely, omit, any, of, these, string, parts, but, often, include, additional, string, instruments, especially, the, concert, harp, and, piano, in, the, baroque, orchestra, from, the, 1600s, 1750, or, with, modern, groups, playing, early, music, harpsichord, is, almost, always, used, to, play, the, basso, continuo, part, the, written, out, bass, line, and, improvised, chords, and, often, a, theorbo, or, lute, or, a, pipe, organ, in, some, classical, music, such, as, the, string, quartet, the, double, bass, is, not, typically, used, the, cello, plays, the, bass, role, in, this, literature
