intends, to, use, to, sail, to, the, mainland, but, ends, up, being, too, large, and, too, far, from, water, to, launch, and, a, smaller, boat, that, he, uses, to, explore, the, coast, of, the, island, more, years, pass, and, crusoe, discovers, cannibals, who, occasionally, visit, the, island, to, kill, and, eat, prisoners, alarmed, at, this, he, conserves, the, ammunition, he, d, used, for, hunting, running, low, at, that, point, for, defence, and, fortifies, his, home, in, case, the, cannibals, discover, his, presence, on, the, island, he, plans, to, kill, them, for, committing, an, abomination, but, later, realizes, he, has, no, right, to, do, so, as, the, cannibals, do, not, knowingly, commit, a, crime, one, day, crusoe, finds, that, a, spanish, galleon, has, run, aground, on, the, island, during, a, storm, but, his, hopes, for, rescue, are, dashed, when, he, discovers, that, the, crew, abandoned, ship, nevertheless, the, abandoned, galleon, s, untouched, supplies, of, food, and, ammunition, along, with, the, ship, s, dog, add, to, crusoe, s, reserves, every, night, he, dreams, of, obtaining, one, or, two, servants, by, freeing, some, prisoners, during, the,

are, now, living, with, friday, s, tribe, seeing, renewed, hope, for, rescue, and, with, friday, s, help, crusoe, builds, another, but, smaller, dugout, canoe, for, a, renewed, plan, to, sail, to, the, mainland, after, more, cannibals, arrive, to, partake, in, a, feast, crusoe, and, friday, kill, most, of, them, and, save, two, prisoners, one, is, friday, s, father, and, the, other, is, a, spaniard, who, informs, crusoe, about, the, other, spaniards, shipwrecked, on, the, mainland, a, plan, is, devised, wherein, the, spaniard, would, return, to, the, mainland, with, friday, s, father, and, bring, back, the, others, build, a, ship, and, sail, to, a, spanish, port, before, the, spaniards, return, an, english, ship, appears, the, sailors, have, staged, a, mutiny, against, their, captain, and, intend, to, leave, him, and, those, still, loyal, to, him, on, the, island, crusoe, and, the, ship, s, captain, strike, a, deal, in, which, crusoe, helps, the, captain, and, the, loyal, sailors, retake, the, ship, with, their, ringleader, executed, by, the, captain, the, mutineers, take, up, crusoe, s, offer, to, remain, on, the, island, rather, than, being, returned, to, england,

the, island, on, 19, december, 1686, and, arrives, in, england, on, 11, june, 1687, he, learns, that, his, family, believed, him, dead, as, a, result, he, was, left, nothing, in, his, father, s, will, crusoe, departs, for, lisbon, to, reclaim, the, profits, of, his, estate, in, brazil, which, has, granted, him, much, wealth, in, conclusion, he, transports, his, wealth, overland, to, england, from, portugal, to, avoid, travelling, by, sea, friday, accompanies, him, and, en, route, they, endure, one, last, adventure, together, as, they, fight, off, famished, wolves, while, crossing, the, pyrenees, there, were, many, stories, of, real, life, castaways, in, defoe, s, time, most, famously, defoe, s, suspected, inspiration, for, robinson, crusoe, is, thought, to, be, scottish, sailor, alexander, selkirk, who, spent, four, years, on, the, uninhabited, island, of, m, s, a, tierra, renamed, robinson, crusoe, island, in, 1966, 23, 24, in, the, juan, fern, ndez, islands, off, the, chilean, coast, selkirk, was, rescued, in, 1709, by, woodes, rogers, during, an, english, expedition, that, led, to, the, publication, of, selkirk, s, adventures, in, both, a, voyage, to, the, south, sea, and, round, the, world, and, a, cruising, voyage, around, the, world, in, 1712, according, to, tim, severin, daniel, defoe, a, secretive, man, neither, confirmed, nor, denied, that, selkirk, was, the, model, for, the, hero, of, his, book, apparently, written, in, six, months, or, less, robinson, crusoe, was, a, publishing, phenomenon, according, to, andrew, lambert, author, of, crusoe, s, island, it, is, a, false, premise, to, suppose, that, defoe, s, novel, was, inspired, by, the, experiences, of, a, single, person, such, as, selkirk, because, the, story, is, a, complex, compound, of, all, the, other, buccaneer, survival, stories, however, robinson, crusoe, is, far, from, a, copy, of, rogers, account, becky, little, argues, three, events, that, distinguish, the, two, stories, the, economic, and, dynamic, thrust, of, the, book, is, completely, alien, to, what, the, buccaneers, are, doing, lambert, says, the, buccaneers, just, want, to, capture, some, loot, and, come, home, and, drink, it, all, and, crusoe, isn, t, doing, that, at, all, he, s, an, economic, imperialist, he, s, creating, a, world, of, trade, and, profit, other, possible, sources, for, the, narrative, include, ibn, tufail, s, hayy, ibn, yaqdhan, and, spanish, sixteenth, century, sailor, pedro, serrano, ibn, tufail, s, hayy, ibn, yaqdhan, is, a, twelfth, century, philosophical, novel, also, set, on, a, desert, island, and, translated, from, arabic, into, latin, and, english, a, number, of, times, in, the, half, century, preceding, defoe, s, novel, pedro, luis, serrano, was, a, spanish, sailor, who, was, marooned, for, seven, or, eight, years, on, a, small, desert, island, after, shipwrecking, in, the, 1520s, on, a, small, island, in, the, caribbean, off, the, coast, of, nicaragua, he, had, no, access, to, fresh, water, and, lived, off, the, blood, and, flesh, of, sea, turtles, and, birds, he, was, quite, a, celebrity, when, he, returned, to, europe, before, passing, away, he, recorded, the, hardships, suffered, in, documents, that, show, the, endless, anguish, and, suffering, the, product, of, absolute, abandonment, to, his, fate, now, held, in, the, general, archive, of, the, indies, in, seville, it, is, quite, possible, that, defoe, heard, his, story, in, one, of, his, visits, to, spain, before, becoming, a, writer, yet, another, source, for, defoe, s, novel, may, have, been, the, robert, knox, account, of, his, abduction, by, the, king, of, ceylon, rajasinha, ii, of, kandy, in, 1659, in, an, historical, relation, of, the, island, ceylon, severin, 2002, unravels, a, much, wider, range, of, potential, sources, of, inspiration, and, concludes, by, identifying, castaway, surgeon, henry, pitman, as, the, most, likely, severin, argues, that, since, pitman, appears, to, have, lived, in, the, lodgings, above, the, father, s, publishing, house, and, that, defoe, himself, was, a, mercer, in, the, area, at, the, time, defoe, may, have, met, pitman, in, person, and, learned, of, his, experiences, first, hand, or, possibly, through, submission, of, a, draft, severin, also, discusses, another, publicized, case, of, a, marooned, man, named, only, as, will, of, the, miskito, people, of, central, america, who, may, have, led, to, the, depiction, of, friday, secord, 1963, analyses, the, composition, of, robinson, crusoe, and, gives, a, list, of, possible, sources, of, the, story, rejecting, the, common, theory, that, the, story, of, selkirk, is, defoe, s, only, source, the, book, was, published, on, 25, april, 1719, before, the, end, of, the, year, this, first, volume, had, run, through, four, editions, by, the, end, of, the, nineteenth, century, no, book, in, the, history, of, western, literature, had, more, editions, spin, offs, and, translations, even, into, languages, such, as, inuktitut, coptic, and, maltese, than, robinson, crusoe, with, more, than, 700, such, alternative, versions, including, children, s, versions, with, pictures, and, no, text, the, term, robinsonade, was, coined, to, describe, the, genre, of, stories, similar, to, robinson, crusoe, defoe, went, on, to, write, a, lesser, known, sequel, the, farther, adventures, of, robinson, crusoe, 1719, it, was, intended, to, be, the, last, part, of, his, stories, according, to, the, original, title, page, of, the, sequel, s, first, edition, but, a, third, book, was, published, 1720, serious, reflections, during, the, life, and, surprising, adventures, of, robinson, crusoe, with, his, vision, of, the, angelick, world, he, is, the, true, prototype, of, the, british, colonist, the, whole, anglo, saxon, spirit, in, crusoe, the, manly, independence, the, unconscious, cruelty, the, persistence, the, slow, yet, efficient, intelligence, the, sexual, apathy, the, calculating, taciturnity, irish, novelist, james, joyce, the, novel, has, been, subject, to, numerous, analyses, and, interpretations, since, its, publication, in, a, sense, crusoe, attempts, to, replicate, his, society, on, the, island, this, is, achieved, through, the, use, of, european, technology, agriculture, and, even, a, rudimentary, political, hierarchy, several, times, in, the, novel, crusoe, refers, to, himself, as, the, king, of, the, island, while, the, captain, describes, him, as, the, governor, to, the, mutineers, at, the, very, end, of, the, novel, the, island, is, referred, to, as, a, colony, the, idealized, master, servant, relationship, defoe, depicts, between, crusoe, and, friday, can, also, be, seen, in, terms, of, cultural, assimilation, with, crusoe, representing, the, enlightened, european, while, friday, is, the, savage, who, can, only, be, redeemed, from, his, cultural, manners, through, assimilation, into, crusoe, s, culture, nonetheless, defoe, used, friday, to, criticize, the, spanish, colonization, of, the, americas, according, to, j, p, hunter, robinson, is, not, a, hero, but, an, everyman, he, begins, as, a, wanderer, aimless, on, a, sea, he, does, not, understand, and, ends, as, a, pilgrim, crossing, a, final, mountain, to, enter, the, promised, land, the, book, tells, the, story, of, how, robinson, becomes, closer, to, god, not, through, listening, to, sermons, in, a, church, but, through, spending, time, alone, amongst, nature, with, only, a, bible, to, read, conversely, cultural, critic, and, literary, scholar, michael, gurnow, views, the, novel, from, a, rousseauian, perspective, the, central, character, s, movement, from, a, primitive, state, to, a, more, civilized, one, is, interpreted, as, crusoe, s, denial, of, humanity, s, state, of, nature, robinson, crusoe, is, filled, with, religious, aspects, defoe, was, a, puritan, moralist, and, normally, worked, in, the, guide, tradition, writing, books, on, how, to, be, a, good, puritan, christian, such, as, the, new, family, instructor, 1727, and, religious, courtship, 1722, while, robinson, crusoe, is, far, more, than, a, guide, it, shares, many, of, the, themes, and, theological, and, moral, points, of, view, crusoe, may, have, been, taken, from, timothy, cruso, a, classmate, of, defoe, s, who, had, written, guide, books, including, god, the, guide, of, youth, 1695, before, dying, at, an, early, age, just, eight, years, before, defoe, wrote, robinson, crusoe, cruso, would, have, been, remembered, by, contemporaries, and, the, association, with, guide, books, is, clear, it, has, even, been, speculated, that, god, the, guide, of, youth, inspired, robinson, crusoe, because, of, a, number, of, passages, in, that, work, that, are, closely, tied, to, the, novel, a, leitmotif, of, the, novel, is, the, christian, notion, of, providence, penitence, and, redemption, crusoe, comes, to, repent, of, the, follies, of, his, youth, defoe, also, foregrounds, this, theme, by, arranging, highly, significant, events, in, the, novel, to, occur, on, crusoe, s, birthday, the, denouement, culminates, not, only, in, crusoe, s, deliverance, from, the, island, but, his, spiritual, deliverance, his, acceptance, of, christian, doctrine, and, in, his, intuition, of, his, own, salvation, when, confronted, with, the, cannibals, crusoe, wrestles, with, the, problem, of, cultural, relativism, despite, his, disgust, he, feels, unjustified, in, holding, the, natives, morally, responsible, for, a, practice, so, deeply, ingrained, in, their, culture, nevertheless, he, retains, his, belief, in, an, absolute, standard, of, morality, he, regards, cannibalism, as, a, national, crime, and, forbids, friday, from, practising, it, in, classical, neoclassical, and, austrian, economics, crusoe, is, regularly, used, to, illustrate, the, theory, of, production, and, choice, in, the, absence, of, trade, money, and, prices, crusoe, must, allocate, effort, between, production, and, leisure, and, must, choose, between, alternative, production, possibilities, to, meet, his, needs, the, arrival, of, friday, is, then, used, to, illustrate, the, possibility, of, trade, and, the, gains, that, result, one, day, about, noon, going, towards, my, boat, i, was, exceedingly, surprised, with, the, print, of, a, man, s, naked, foot, on, the, shore, which, was, very, plain, to, be, seen, on, the, sand, defoe, s, robinson, crusoe, 1719, the, work, has, been, variously, read, as, an, allegory, for, the, development, of, civilization, as, a, manifesto, of, economic, individualism, and, as, an, expression, of, european, colonial, desires, significantly, it, also, shows, the, importance, of, repentance, and, illustrates, the, strength, of, defoe, s, religious, convictions, critic, m, e, novak, supports, the, connection, between, the, religious, and, economic, themes, within, robinson, crusoe, citing, defoe, s, religious, ideology, as, the, influence, for, his, portrayal, of, crusoe, s, economic, ideals, and, his, support, of, the, individual, novak, cites, ian, watt, s, extensive, research, which, explores, the, impact, that, several, romantic, era, novels, had, against, economic, individualism, and, the, reversal, of, those, ideals, that, takes, place, within, robinson, crusoe, in, tess, lewis, s, review, the, heroes, we, deserve, of, ian, watt, s, article, she, furthers, watt, s, argument, with, a, development, on, defoe, s, intention, as, an, author, to, use, individualism, to, signify, nonconformity, in, religion, and, the, admirable, qualities, of, self, reliance, 678, this, further, supports, the, belief, that, defoe, used, aspects, of, spiritual, autobiography, to, introduce, the, benefits, of, individualism, to, a, not, entirely, convinced, religious, community, j, paul, hunter, has, written, extensively, on, the, subject, of, robinson, crusoe, as, apparent, spiritual, autobiography, tracing, the, influence, of, defoe, s, puritan, ideology, through, crusoe, s, narrative, and, his, acknowledgement, of, human, imperfection, in, pursuit, of, meaningful, spiritual, engagements, the, cycle, of, repentance, deliverance, this, spiritual, pattern, and, its, episodic, nature, as, well, as, the, re, discovery, of, earlier, female, novelists, have, kept, robinson, crusoe, from, being, classified, as, a, novel, let, alone, the, first, novel, written, in, english, despite, the, blurbs, on, some, book, covers, early, critics, such, as, robert, louis, stevenson, admired, it, saying, that, the, footprint, scene, in, crusoe, was, one, of, the, four, greatest, in, english, literature, and, most, unforgettable, more, prosaically, wesley, vernon, has, seen, the, origins, of, forensic, podiatry, in, this, episode, it, has, inspired, a, new, genre, the, robinsonade, as, works, such, as, johann, david, wyss, the, swiss, family, robinson, 1812, adapt, its, premise, and, has, provoked, modern, postcolonial, responses, including, j, m, coetzee, s, foe, 1986, and, michel, tournier, s, vendredi, ou, les, limbes, du, pacifique, in, english, friday, or, the, other, island, 1967, two, sequels, followed, defoe, s, the, farther, adventures, of, robinson, crusoe, 1719, and, his, serious, reflections, during, the, life, and, surprising, adventures, of, robinson, crusoe, with, his, vision, of, the, angelick, world, 1720, jonathan, swift, s, gulliver, s, travels, 1726, is, in, part, a, parody, of, defoe, s, adventure, novel, the, book, proved, to, be, so, popular, that, the, names, of, the, two, main, protagonists, crusoe, and, friday, have, entered, the, language, during, world, war, ii, people, who, decided, to, stay, and, hide, in, the, ruins, of, the, german, occupied, city, of, warsaw, for, a, period, of, three, winter, months, from, october, to, january, 1945, when, they, were, rescued, by, the, red, army, were, later, called, robinson, crusoes, of, warsaw, robinsonowie, warszawscy, robinson, crusoe, usually, referred, to, his, servant, as, my, man, friday, from, which, the, term, man, friday, or, girl, friday, originated, robinson, crusoe, marked, the, beginning, of, realistic, fiction, as, a, literary, genre, its, success, led, to, many, imitators, and, castaway, novels, written, by, ambrose, evans, penelope, aubin, and, others, became, quite, popular, in, europe, in, the, 18th, and, early, 19th, centuries, most, of, these, have, fallen, into, obscurity, but, some, became, established, including, the, swiss, family, robinson, which, borrowed, crusoe, s, first, name, for, its, title, jonathan, swift, s, gulliver, s, travels, published, seven, years, after, robinson, crusoe, may, be, read, as, a, systematic, rebuttal, of, defoe, s, optimistic, account, of, human, capability, in, the, unthinkable, swift, the, spontaneous, philosophy, of, a, church, of, england, man, warren, montag, argues, that, swift, was, concerned, about, refuting, the, notion, that, the, individual, precedes, society, as, defoe, s, novel, seems, to, suggest, in, treasure, island, author, robert, louis, stevenson, parodies, crusoe, with, the,
