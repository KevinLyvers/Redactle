on, a, newspaper, article, that, fran, ois, truffaut, read, in, the, news, in, brief, about, michel, portail, and, his, american, journalist, girlfriend, beverly, lynette, in, november, 1952, portail, stole, a, car, to, visit, his, sick, mother, in, le, havre, and, ended, up, killing, a, motorcycle, cop, named, grimberg, truffaut, wrote, a, treatment, with, claude, chabrol, but, they, disagreed, on, the, story, structure, godard, was, working, as, a, press, agent, at, 20th, century, fox, when, he, met, producer, georges, de, beauregard, he, helped, beauregard, with, the, script, for, p, cheur, d, islande, but, pitched, him, on, breathless, because, he, liked, the, treatment, chabrol, and, truffaut, were, now, star, directors, they, were, at, the, cannes, film, festival, in, may, 1959, when, they, wrote, beauregard, to, endorse, godard, as, the, director, their, names, helped, greenlight, the, film, but, both, would, have, very, small, roles, in, its, production, the, final, screenplay, deviates, very, little, from, truffaut, s, original, treatment, aside, from, the, much, longer, bedroom, scene, 153, godard, wrote, the, script, as, he, went, along, he, told, truffaut, the, subject, will, be, the, story, of, a, boy, who, thinks, of, death, and, of, a, girl, who, doesn, t, 29, 30, truffaut, believed, godard, s, change, to, the, ending, was, personal, in, my, script, the, film, ends, with, the, boy, walking, along, the, street, as, more, and, more, people, turn, and, stare, after, him, because, his, photo, s, on, the, front, of, all, the, newspapers, jean, luc, chose, a, violent, end, because, he, was, by, nature, sadder, than, i, godard, used, screenwriter, paul, g, gauff, who, was, known, as, a, swaggering, seducer, of, women, as, inspiration, for, michel, s, character, fellow, new, wave, director, jacques, rivette, appears, in, a, cameo, as, the, dead, body, of, a, man, hit, by, a, car, in, the, street, 74, the, film, includes, many, in, jokes, like, the, young, woman, selling, cahiers, du, cin, ma, and, michel, s, occasional, alias, of, laszlo, kovacs, the, name, of, belmondo, s, character, in, chabrol, s, 1959, film, web, of, passion, jean, paul, belmondo, was, not, famous, outside, of, france, prior, to, breathless, in, order, to, broaden, the, film, s, commercial, appeal, godard, sought, a, prominent, leading, lady, who, would, be, willing, to, work, in, his, low, budget, film, he, came, to, jean, seberg, through, his, acquaintance, with, her, husband, francois, moreuil, in, june, 1959, seberg, agreed, to, appear, in, the, film, for, 15, 000, one, sixth, of, the, film, s, budget, godard, gave, moreuil, a, cameo, in, the, film, during, filming, seberg, privately, questioned, godard, s, style, and, wondered, if, the, film, would, be, commercially, viable, after, it, was, a, success, she, reprised, her, character, in, godard, s, le, grand, escroc, godard, wanted, cinematographer, michel, latouche, to, shoot, the, film, after, working, with, him, on, his, short, films, instead, de, beauregard, hired, raoul, coutard, who, he, had, on, contract, the, 1958, ethno, fiction, moi, un, noir, has, been, credited, as, a, key, influence, for, godard, this, can, be, seen, in, the, adoption, of, jump, cuts, use, of, real, locations, rather, than, constructed, sets, and, the, documentary, newsreel, format, of, filming, godard, envisaged, breathless, as, a, documentary, and, tasked, cinematographer, raoul, coutard, to, shoot, the, entire, film, on, a, hand, held, camera, with, next, to, no, lighting, in, order, to, shoot, under, low, light, levels, coutard, had, to, use, ilford, hp5, film, which, was, not, available, as, motion, picture, film, stock, at, the, time, he, therefore, took, 18, metre, lengths, of, hp5, film, sold, for, 35mm, still, cameras, and, spliced, them, into, 120, metre, rolls, during, development, he, pushed, the, negative, one, stop, from, 400, asa, to, 800, asa, the, size, of, the, sprocket, holes, in, the, photographic, film, was, different, from, that, of, motion, picture, film, and, the, eclair, cameflex, camera, was, the, only, camera, that, worked, for, the, film, used, nearly, the, entire, film, had, to, be, dubbed, in, post, production, because, the, cameflex, was, noisy, and, incapable, of, synchronized, sound, filming, ran, 23, days, from, august, 17, until, september, 12, 1959, it, included, president, eisenhower, s, visit, to, paris, which, godard, used, as, a, backdrop, for, the, film, 152, the, crew, met, at, caf, notre, dame, and, shot, for, two, hours, until, godard, ran, out, of, ideas, according, to, coutard, the, film, was, virtually, improvised, on, the, spot, and, godard, wrote, dialogue, in, an, exercise, book, that, no, one, was, allowed, to, see, godard, gave, lines, to, belmondo, and, seberg, with, only, brief, rehearsals, before, filming, locations, were, selected, in, advance, and, assistant, director, pierre, rissient, described, the, shoot, as, very, organized, however, filming, was, done, without, permits, adding, to, the, spontaneous, feel, godard, wanted, michel, s, death, was, filmed, on, the, rue, campagne, premi, re, in, paris, actor, richard, balducci, said, shooting, days, could, range, from, 15, minutes, to, 12, hours, depending, on, how, many, ideas, godard, had, producer, georges, de, beauregard, wrote, a, letter, to, the, crew, complaining, about, the, erratic, shooting, schedule, coutard, claimed, beauregard, got, in, a, fistfight, with, godard, when, he, found, the, director, at, a, caf, on, a, day, when, he, had, called, in, sick, godard, shot, the, movie, s, first, sequence, toward, the, end, but, most, of, the, filming, was, chronological, there, was, minimal, crew, and, no, lights, for, the, bedroom, scene, with, michel, and, patricia, at, the, h, tel, de, su, de, godard, was, determined, to, shoot, there, after, living, at, the, hotel, in, the, early, 1950s, instead, of, renting, a, dolly, with, complicated, and, time, consuming, tracks, to, lay, godard, often, pushed, coutard, in, a, wheelchair, for, certain, street, scenes, coutard, hid, in, a, postal, cart, with, a, hole, for, the, lens, and, packages, piled, on, top, of, him, breathless, was, processed, and, edited, at, gtc, labs, in, joinville, by, c, cile, decugis, and, his, assistant, lila, herman, decugis, said, the, film, earned, a, pre, release, reputation, as, the, worst, film, of, the, year, pierre, rissient, said, that, the, jump, cut, style, was, not, intended, during, the, film, s, shooting, or, the, initial, stages, of, editing, coutard, said, that, there, was, a, panache, in, the, way, it, was, edited, that, didn, t, match, at, all, the, way, it, was, shot, the, editing, gave, it, a, very, different, tone, than, the, films, we, were, used, to, seeing, the, film, s, use, of, jump, cuts, has, been, called, innovative, andrew, sarris, analyzed, it, as, existentially, representing, the, meaninglessness, of, the, time, interval, between, moral, decisions, godard, and, his, media, savvy, friends, were, well, positioned, to, gin, up, publicity, before, the, movie, was, released, richard, balducci, was, in, charge, of, promoting, the, film, and, he, embedded, a, reporter, from, france, observateur, in, the, crew, to, report, on, the, production, a, novelization, by, claude, francolin, was, released, in, february, 1960, a, month, before, the, film, s, release, columbia, also, issued, a, soundtrack, album, of, martial, solal, s, music, 93, 4, 97, breathless,

the, most, striking, we, have, hiroshima, mon, amour, for, that, but, it, is, the, most, representative, by, june, of, that, year, it, was, already, pointed, to, as, the, crowning, point, of, the, new, wave, bosley, crowther, called, the, film, a, fascinating, communication, which, is, emphatically, unrestrainedly, vicious, completely, devoid, of, moral, tone, and, shocking, due, to, the, vigor, of, its, reportorial, candor, crowther, described, godard, s, editing, as, pictorial, cacophony, he, saw, belmondo, as, hypnotically, ugly, and, the, most, effective, cigarette, mouther, and, thumb, to, lip, rubber, since, time, began, archer, winsten, deemed, it, a, very, fine, piece, of, work, though, he, found, the, film, too, insubstantial, to, be, remembered, he, concluded, the, technique, should, linger, and, so, should, these, talents, here, so, highly, visible, and, memorable, in, a, 1972, essay, about, breathless, oliver, stone, zeroed, in, on, the, bedroom, scenes, as, the, core, of, the, film, he, explains, the, rigidity, of, cinematic, bedroom, scenes, with, their, definite, pace, from, window, to, bed, and, climactically, into, the, sheets, even, in, the, rather, perverse, imaginations, of, vadim, or, chabrol, these, basic, rhythms, operate, with, godard, no, such, thing, richard, brody, enthused, breathless, opened, not, in, an, art, house, but, at, a, chain, of, four, commercial, theaters, selling, 259, 046, tickets, in, four, weeks, the, eventual, profit, was, substantial, the, film, s, success, with, the, public, corresponded, to, its, generally, ardent, and, astonished, critical, reception, 72, the, new, york, times, critic, a, o, scott, wrote, in, 2010, 50, years, after, the, release, of, breathless, that, it, is, both, a, pop, artifact, and, a, daring, work, of, art, and, even, at, 50, still, cool, still, new, still, after, all, this, time, a, bulletin, from, the, future, of, movies, roger, ebert, included, it, on, his, great, movies, list, in, 2003, writing, that, no, debut, film, since, citizen, kane, in, 1942, has, been, as, influential, dismissing, its, jump, cuts, as, the, biggest, breakthrough, and, instead, calling, revolutionary, its, headlong, pacing, its, cool, detachment, its, dismissal, of, authority, and, the, way, its, narcissistic, young, heroes, are, obsessed, with, themselves, and, oblivious, to, the, larger, society, the, film, has, a, 95, score, on, rotten, tomatoes, based, on, 82, reviews, the, japanese, filmmaker, akira, kurosawa, cited, this, movie, as, one, of, his, 100, favorite, films,
