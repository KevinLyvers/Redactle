the, mona, lisa, m, o, n, l, i, s, moh, n, lee, s, italian, gioconda, or, monna, lisa, french, joconde, is, a, half, length, portrait, painting, by, italian, artist, leonardo, da, vinci, considered, an, archetypal, masterpiece, of, the, italian, renaissance, it, has, been, described, as, the, best, known, the, most, visited, the, most, written, about, the, most, sung, about, the, most, parodied, work, of, art, in, the, world, the, painting, s, novel, qualities, include, the, subject, s, enigmatic, expression, monumentality, of, the, composition, the, subtle, modelling, of, forms, and, the, atmospheric, illusionism, the, painting, has, been, traditionally, considered, to, depict, the, italian, noblewoman, lisa, del, giocondo, it, is, painted, in, oil, on, a, white, poplar, panel, leonardo, never, gave, the, painting, to, the, giocondo, family, it, was, believed, to, have, been, painted, between, 1503, and, 1506, however, leonardo, may, have, continued, working, on, it, as, late, as, 1517, king, francis, i, of, france, acquired, the, mona, lisa, after, leonardo, s, death, in, 1519, and, it, is, now, the, property, of, the, french, republic, it, has, normally, been, on, display, at, the, louvre, in, paris, since, 1797, the, painting, s, global, fame, and, popularity, partly, stem, from, its, 1911, theft, by, vincenzo, peruggia, who, attributed, his, actions, to, italian, patriotism, a, belief, it, should, belong, to, italy, the, theft, and, subsequent, recovery, in, 1914, generated, unprecedented, publicity, for, an, art, theft, and, led, to, the, publication, of, many, cultural, depictions, such, as, the, 1915, opera, mona, lisa, two, early, 1930s, films, the, theft, of, the, mona, lisa, and, ars, ne, lupin, and, the, song, mona, lisa, recorded, by, nat, king, cole, one, of, the, most, successful, songs, of, the, 1950s, the, mona, lisa, is, one, of, the, most, valuable, paintings, in, the, world, it, holds, the, guinness, world, record, for, the, highest, known, painting, insurance, valuation, in, history, at, us, 100, million, in, 1962, equivalent, to, 1, billion, as, of, 2023, the, title, of, the, painting, which, is, known, in, english, as, mona, lisa, is, based, on, the, presumption, that, it, depicts, lisa, del, giocondo, although, her, likeness, is, uncertain, renaissance, art, historian, giorgio, vasari, wrote, that, leonardo, undertook, to, paint, for, francesco, del, giocondo, the, portrait, of, mona, lisa, his, wife, monna, in, italian, is, a, polite, form, of, address, originating, as, ma, donna, similar, to, ma, am, madam, or, my, lady, in, english, this, became, madonna, and, its, contraction, monna, the, title, of, the, painting, though, traditionally, spelled, mona, in, english, is, spelled, in, italian, as, monna, lisa, mona, being, a, vulgarity, in, italian, but, this, is, rare, in, english, lisa, del, giocondo, was, a, member, of, the, gherardini, family, of, florence, and, tuscany, and, the, wife, of, wealthy, florentine, silk, merchant, francesco, del, giocondo, the, painting, is, thought, to, have, been, commissioned, for, their, new, home, and, to, celebrate, the, birth, of, their, second, son, andrea, the, italian, name, for, the, painting, la, gioconda, means, jocund, happy, or, jovial, or, literally, the, jocund, one, a, pun, on, the, feminine, form, of, lisa, s, married, name, giocondo, in, french, the, title, la, joconde, has, the, same, meaning, vasari, s, account, of, the, mona, lisa, comes, from, his, biography, of, leonardo, published, in, 1550, 31, years, after, the, artist, s, death, it, has, long, been, the, best, known, source, of, information, on, the, provenance, of, the, work, and, identity, of, the, sitter, leonardo, s, assistant, sala, at, his, death, in, 1524, owned, a, portrait, which, in, his, personal, papers, was, named, la, gioconda, a, painting, bequeathed, to, him, by, leonardo, that, leonardo, painted, such, a, work, and, its, date, were, confirmed, in, 2005, when, a, scholar, at, heidelberg, university, discovered, a, marginal, note, in, a, 1477, printing, of, a, volume, by, ancient, roman, philosopher, cicero, dated, october, 1503, the, note, was, written, by, leonardo, s, contemporary, agostino, vespucci, this, note, likens, leonardo, to, renowned, greek, painter, apelles, who, is, mentioned, in, the, text, and, states, that, leonardo, was, at, that, time, working, on, a, painting, of, lisa, del, giocondo, in, response, to, the, announcement, of, the, discovery, of, this, document, vincent, delieuvin, the, louvre, representative, stated, leonardo, da, vinci, was, painting, in, 1503, the, portrait, of, a, florentine, lady, by, the, name, of, lisa, del, giocondo, about, this, we, are, now, certain, unfortunately, we, cannot, be, absolutely, certain, that, this, portrait, of, lisa, del, giocondo, is, the, painting, of, the, louvre, the, catalogue, raisonn, leonardo, da, vinci, 2019, confirms, that, the, painting, probably, depicts, lisa, del, giocondo, with, isabella, d, este, being, the, only, plausible, alternative, scholars, have, developed, several, alternative, views, arguing, that, lisa, del, giocondo, was, the, subject, of, a, different, portrait, and, identifying, at, least, four, other, paintings, referred, to, by, vasari, as, the, mona, lisa, several, other, people, have, been, proposed, as, the, subject, of, the, painting, including, isabella, of, aragon, cecilia, gallerani, costanza, d, avalos, duchess, of, francavilla, pacifica, brandano, brandino, isabella, gualanda, caterina, sforza, bianca, giovanna, sforza, sala, and, even, leonardo, himself, psychoanalyst, sigmund, freud, theorized, that, leonardo, imparted, an, approving, smile, from, his, mother, caterina, onto, the, mona, lisa, and, other, works, the, mona, lisa, bears, a, strong, resemblance, to, many, renaissance, depictions, of, the, virgin, mary, who, was, at, that, time, seen, as, an, ideal, for, womanhood, the, woman, sits, markedly, upright, in, a, pozzetto, armchair, with, her, arms, folded, a, sign, of, her, reserved, posture, her, gaze, is, fixed, on, the, observer, the, woman, appears, alive, to, an, unusual, extent, which, leonardo, achieved, by, his, method, of, not, drawing, outlines, the, soft, blending, sfumato, creates, an, ambiguous, mood, mainly, in, two, features, the, corners, of, the, mouth, and, the, corners, of, the, eyes, the, depiction, of, the, sitter, in, three, quarter, profile, is, similar, to, late, 15th, century, works, by, lorenzo, di, credi, and, agnolo, di, domenico, del, mazziere, z, llner, notes, that, the, sitter, s, general, position, can, be, traced, back, to, flemish, models, and, that, in, particular, the, vertical, slices, of, columns, at, both, sides, of, the, panel, had, precedents, in, flemish, portraiture, woods, marsden, cites, hans, memling, s, portrait, of, benedetto, portinari, 1487, or, italian, imitations, such, as, sebastiano, mainardi, s, pendant, portraits, for, the, use, of, a, loggia, which, has, the, effect, of, mediating, between, the, sitter, and, the, distant, landscape, a, feature, missing, from, leonardo, s, earlier, portrait, of, ginevra, de, benci, the, painting, was, one, of, the, first, italian, portraits, to, depict, the, sitter, in, front, of, an, imaginary, landscape, although, some, scholars, favor, a, realistic, description, and, leonardo, was, one, of, the, first, painters, to, use, aerial, perspective, the, enigmatic, woman, is, portrayed, seated, in, what, appears, to, be, an, open, loggia, with, dark, pillar, bases, on, either, side, behind, her, a, vast, landscape, recedes, to, icy, mountains, winding, paths, and, a, distant, bridge, giving, only, the, slightest, indications, of, human, presence, leonardo, has, chosen, to, place, the, horizon, line, not, at, the, neck, as, he, did, with, ginevra, de, benci, but, on, a, level, with, the, eyes, thus, linking, the, figure, with, the, landscape, and, emphasizing, the, mysterious, nature, of, the, painting, the, bridge, in, the, background, was, identified, by, silvano, vincenti, as, the, four, arched, romito, di, laterina, bridge, from, etruscan, roman, times, near, laterina, arezzo, over, the, arno, river, other, bridges, with, similar, arches, suggested, as, possible, locations, had, more, arches, some, observers, find, similarities, with, the, azzone, visconti, bridge, mona, lisa, has, no, clearly, visible, eyebrows, or, eyelashes, although, vasari, describes, the, eyebrows, in, detail, in, 2007, french, engineer, pascal, cotte, announced, that, his, ultra, high, resolution, scans, of, the, painting, provide, evidence, that, mona, lisa, was, originally, painted, with, eyelashes, and, eyebrows, but, that, these, had, gradually, disappeared, over, time, perhaps, as, a, result, of, overcleaning, cotte, discovered, that, the, painting, had, been, reworked, several, times, with, changes, made, to, the, size, of, the, face, and, the, direction, of, gaze, he, also, found, that, in, one, layer, the, subject, was, depicted, wearing, numerous, hairpins, and, a, headdress, adorned, with, pearls, which, was, later, scrubbed, out, and, overpainted, there, has, been, much, speculation, regarding, the, painting, s, model, and, landscape, for, example, leonardo, probably, painted, his, model, faithfully, since, her, beauty, is, not, seen, as, being, among, the, best, even, when, measured, by, late, quattrocento, 15th, century, or, even, twenty, first, century, standards, some, historians, in, eastern, art, such, as, yukio, yashiro, argue, that, the, landscape, in, the, background, of, the, picture, was, influenced, by, chinese, paintings, but, this, thesis, has, been, contested, for, lack, of, clear, evidence, research, in, 2003, by, professor, margaret, livingstone, of, harvard, university, said, that, mona, lisa, s, smile, disappears, when, observed, with, direct, vision, known, as, foveal, because, of, the, way, the, human, eye, processes, visual, information, it, is, less, suited, to, pick, up, shadows, directly, however, peripheral, vision, can, pick, up, shadows, well, research, in, 2008, by, a, geomorphology, professor, at, urbino, university, and, an, artist, photographer, revealed, that, mona, lisa, s, landscape, was, similar, to, some, views, in, the, montefeltro, region, in, the, italian, provinces, of, pesaro, and, urbino, and, rimini, research, in, 2023, 2024, by, geologist, and, art, historian, ann, pizzorusso, suggests, that, the, landscape, contains, several, recognisable, features, of, lecco, on, the, shores, of, lake, como, in, the, lombardy, region, of, northern, italy, of, leonardo, da, vinci, s, works, the, mona, lisa, is, the, only, portrait, whose, authenticity, has, never, been, seriously, questioned, and, one, of, four, works, the, others, being, saint, jerome, in, the, wilderness, adoration, of, the, magi, and, the, last, supper, whose, attribution, has, avoided, controversy, he, had, begun, working, on, a, portrait, of, lisa, del, giocondo, the, model, of, the, mona, lisa, by, october, 1503, it, is, believed, by, some, that, the, mona, lisa, was, begun, in, 1503, or, 1504, in, florence, although, the, louvre, states, that, it, was, doubtless, painted, between, 1503, and, 1506, art, historian, martin, kemp, says, that, there, are, some, difficulties, in, confirming, the, dates, with, certainty, alessandro, vezzosi, believes, that, the, painting, is, characteristic, of, leonardo, s, style, in, the, final, years, of, his, life, post, 1513, other, academics, argue, that, given, the, historical, documentation, leonardo, would, have, painted, the, work, from, 1513, according, to, vasari, after, he, had, lingered, over, it, four, years, left, it, unfinished, in, 1516, leonardo, was, invited, by, king, francis, i, to, work, at, the, clos, luc, near, the, ch, teau, d, amboise, it, is, believed, that, he, took, the, mona, lisa, with, him, and, continued, to, work, on, it, after, he, moved, to, france, art, historian, carmen, c, bambach, has, concluded, that, leonardo, probably, continued, refining, the, work, until, 1516, or, 1517, leonardo, s, right, hand, was, paralytic, c, 1517, which, may, indicate, why, he, left, the, mona, lisa, unfinished, circa, 1505, raphael, executed, a, pen, and, ink, sketch, in, which, the, columns, flanking, the, subject, are, more, apparent, experts, universally, agree, that, it, is, based, on, leonardo, s, portrait, other, later, copies, of, the, mona, lisa, such, as, those, in, the, national, museum, of, art, architecture, and, design, and, the, walters, art, museum, also, display, large, flanking, columns, as, a, result, it, was, thought, that, the, mona, lisa, had, been, trimmed, however, by, 1993, frank, z, llner, observed, that, the, painting, surface, had, never, been, trimmed, this, was, confirmed, through, a, series, of, tests, in, 2004, in, view, of, this, vincent, delieuvin, curator, of, 16th, century, italian, painting, at, the, louvre, states, that, the, sketch, and, these, other, copies, must, have, been, inspired, by, another, version, while, z, llner, states, that, the, sketch, may, be, after, another, leonardo, portrait, of, the, same, subject, the, record, of, an, october, 1517, visit, by, louis, d, aragon, states, that, the, mona, lisa, was, executed, for, the, deceased, giuliano, de, medici, leonardo, s, steward, at, belvedere, vienna, between, 1513, and, 1516, but, this, was, likely, an, error, according, to, vasari, the, painting, was, created, for, the, model, s, husband, francesco, del, giocondo, a, number, of, experts, have, argued, that, leonardo, made, two, versions, because, of, the, uncertainty, concerning, its, dating, and, commissioner, as, well, as, its, fate, following, leonardo, s, death, in, 1519, and, the, difference, of, details, in, raphael, s, sketch, which, may, be, explained, by, the, possibility, that, he, made, the, sketch, from, memory, the, hypothetical, first, portrait, displaying, prominent, columns, would, have, been, commissioned, by, giocondo, c, 1503, and, left, unfinished, in, leonardo, s, pupil, and, assistant, sala, s, possession, until, his, death, in, 1524, the, second, commissioned, by, giuliano, de, medici, c, 1513, would, have, been, sold, by, sala, to, francis, i, in, 1518, and, is, the, one, in, the, louvre, today, others, believe, that, there, was, only, one, true, mona, lisa, but, are, divided, as, to, the, two, aforementioned, fates, at, some, point, in, the, 16th, century, a, varnish, was, applied, to, the, painting, it, was, kept, at, the, palace, of, fontainebleau, until, louis, xiv, moved, it, to, the, palace, of, versailles, where, it, remained, until, the, french, revolution, in, 1797, it, went, on, permanent, display, at, the, louvre, after, the, french, revolution, the, painting, was, moved, to, the, louvre, but, spent, a, brief, period, in, the, bedroom, of, napoleon, d, 1821, in, the, tuileries, palace, the, mona, lisa, was, not, widely, known, outside, the, art, world, but, in, the, 1860s, a, portion, of, the, french, intelligentsia, began, to, hail, it, as, a, masterwork, of, renaissance, painting, during, the, franco, prussian, war, 1870, 1871, the, painting, was, moved, from, the, louvre, to, the, brest, arsenal, in, 1911, the, painting, was, still, not, popular, among, the, lay, public, on, 21, august, 1911, the, painting, was, stolen, from, the, louvre, the, painting, was, first, reported, missing, the, next, day, by, painter, louis, b, roud, after, some, confusion, as, to, whether, the, painting, was, being, photographed, somewhere, the, louvre, was, closed, for, a, week, for, investigation, french, poet, guillaume, apollinaire, came, under, suspicion, and, was, arrested, and, imprisoned, apollinaire, implicated, his, friend, pablo, picasso, who, was, brought, in, for, questioning, both, were, later, exonerated, the, real, culprit, was, louvre, employee, vincenzo, peruggia, who, had, helped, construct, the, painting, s, glass, case, he, carried, out, the, theft, by, entering, the, building, during, regular, hours, hiding, in, a, broom, closet, and, walking, out, with, the, painting, hidden, under, his, coat, after, the, museum, had, closed, peruggia, was, an, italian, patriot, who, believed, that, leonardo, s, painting, should, have, been, returned, to, an, italian, museum, peruggia, may, have, been, motivated, by, an, associate, whose, copies, of, the, original, would, significantly, rise, in, value, after, the, painting, s, theft, after, having, kept, the, mona, lisa, in, his, apartment, for, two, years, peruggia, grew, impatient, and, was, caught, when, he, attempted, to, sell, it, to, giovanni, poggi, director, of, the, uffizi, gallery, in, florence, it, was, exhibited, in, the, uffizi, gallery, for, over, two, weeks, and, returned, to, the, louvre, on, 4, january, 1914, peruggia, served, six, months, in, prison, for, the, crime, and, was, hailed, for, his, patriotism, in, italy, a, year, after, the, theft, saturday, evening, post, journalist, karl, decker, wrote, that, he, met, an, alleged, accomplice, named, eduardo, de, valfierno, who, claimed, to, have, masterminded, the, theft, forger, yves, chaudron, was, to, have, created, six, copies, of, the, painting, to, sell, in, the, us, while, concealing, the, location, of, the, original, decker, published, this, account, of, the, theft, in, 1932, during, world, war, ii, it, was, again, removed, from, the, louvre, and, taken, first, to, the, ch, teau, d, amboise, then, to, the, loc, dieu, abbey, and, ch, teau, de, chambord, then, finally, to, the, mus, e, ingres, in, montauban, in, recent, decades, the, painting, has, been, temporarily, moved, to, accommodate, renovations, to, the, louvre, on, three, occasions, between, 1992, and, 1995, from, 2001, to, 2005, and, again, in, 2019, a, new, queuing, system, introduced, in, 2019, reduces, the, amount, of, time, museum, visitors, have, to, wait, in, line, to, see, the, painting, after, going, through, the, queue, a, group, has, about, 30, seconds, to, see, the, painting, on, 30, december, 1956, bolivian, ugo, ungaza, villegas, threw, a, rock, at, the, mona, lisa, while, it, was, on, display, at, the, louvre, he, did, so, with, such, force, that, it, shattered, the, glass, case, and, dislodged, a, speck, of, pigment, near, the, left, elbow, the, painting, was, protected, by, glass, because, a, few, years, earlier, a, man, who, claimed, to, be, in, love, with, the, painting, had, cut, it, with, a, razor, blade, and, tried, to, steal, it, since, then, bulletproof, glass, has, been, used, to, shield, the, painting, from, any, further, attacks, subsequently, on, 21, april, 1974, while, the, painting, was, on, display, at, the, tokyo, national, museum, a, woman, sprayed, it, with, red, paint, as, a, protest, against, that, museum, s, failure, to, provide, access, for, disabled, people, on, 2, august, 2009, a, russian, woman, distraught, over, being, denied, french, citizenship, threw, a, ceramic, teacup, purchased, at, the, louvre, the, vessel, shattered, against, the, glass, enclosure, in, both, cases, the, painting, was, undamaged, on, 29, may, 2022, a, male, activist, disguised, as, a, woman, in, a, wheelchair, threw, cake, at, the, protective, glass, covering, the, painting, in, an, apparent, attempt, to, raise, awareness, for, climate, change, the, painting, was, not, damaged, the, man, was, arrested, and, placed, in, psychiatric, care, in, the, police, headquarters, an, investigation, was, opened, after, the, louvre, filed, a, complaint, on, 28, january, 2024, two, attackers, from, the, environmentalist, group, riposte, alimentaire, food, retaliation, threw, soup, at, the, painting, s, protective, glass, demanding, the, right, to, healthy, and, sustainable, food, and, criticizing, the, contemporary, state, of, agriculture, in, the, early, 21st, century, french, scientist, pascal, cotte, hypothesized, a, hidden, portrait, underneath, the, surface, of, the, painting, he, analyzed, the, painting, in, the, louvre, with, reflective, light, technology, beginning, in, 2004, and, produced, circumstantial, evidence, for, his, theory, cotte, admits, that, his, investigation, was, carried, out, only, in, support, of, his, hypotheses, and, should, not, be, considered, as, definitive, proof, the, underlying, portrait, appears, to, be, of, a, model, looking, to, the, side, and, lacks, flanking, columns, but, does, not, fit, with, historical, descriptions, of, the, painting, both, vasari, and, gian, paolo, lomazzo, describe, the, subject, as, smiling, unlike, the, subject, in, cotte, s, supposed, portrait, in, 2020, cotte, published, a, study, alleging, that, the, painting, has, an, underdrawing, transferred, from, a, preparatory, drawing, via, the, spolvero, technique, the, mona, lisa, has, survived, for, more, than, 500, years, and, an, international, commission, convened, in, 1952, noted, that, the, picture, is, in, a, remarkable, state, of, preservation, it, has, never, been, fully, restored, so, the, current, condition, is, partly, due, to, a, variety, of, conservation, treatments, the, painting, has, undergone, a, detailed, analysis, in, 1933, by, madame, de, gironde, revealed, that, earlier, restorers, had, acted, with, a, great, deal, of, restraint, nevertheless, applications, of, varnish, made, to, the, painting, had, darkened, even, by, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, and, an, aggressive, 1809, cleaning, and, revarnishing, removed, some, of, the, uppermost, portion, of, the, paint, layer, resulting, in, a, washed, out, appearance, to, the, face, of, the, figure, despite, the, treatments, the, mona, lisa, has, been, well, cared, for, throughout, its, history, and, although, the, panel, s, warping, caused, the, curators, some, worry, the, 2004, 05, conservation, team, was, optimistic, about, the, future, of, the, work, at, some, point, the, mona, lisa, was, removed, from, its, original, frame, the, unconstrained, poplar, panel, warped, freely, with, changes, in, humidity, and, as, a, result, a, crack, developed, near, the, top, of, the, panel, extending, down, to, the, hairline, of, the, figure, in, the, mid, 18th, century, to, early, 19th, century, two, butterfly, shaped, walnut, braces, were, inserted, into, the, back, of, the, panel, to, a, depth, of, about, one, third, the, thickness, of, the, panel, this, intervention, was, skilfully, executed, and, successfully, stabilized, the, crack, sometime, between, 1888, and, 1905, or, perhaps, during, the, picture, s, theft, the, upper, brace, fell, out, a, later, restorer, glued, and, lined, the, resulting, socket, and, crack, with, cloth, the, picture, is, kept, under, strict, climate, controlled, conditions, in, its, bulletproof, glass, case, the, humidity, is, maintained, at, 50, 10, and, the, temperature, is, maintained, between, 18, c, 64, f, and, 21, c, 70, f, to, compensate, for, fluctuations, in, relative, humidity, the, case, is, supplemented, with, a, bed, of, silica, gel, treated, to, provide, 55, relative, humidity, because, the, mona, lisa, s, poplar, support, expands, and, contracts, with, changes, in, humidity, the, picture, has, experienced, some, warping, in, response, to, warping, and, swelling, experienced, during, its, storage, during, world, war, ii, and, to, prepare, the, picture, for, an, exhibit, to, honour, the, anniversary, of, leonardo, s, 500th, birthday, the, mona, lisa, was, fitted, in, 1951, with, a, flexible, oak, frame, with, beech, crosspieces, this, flexible, frame, which, is, used, in, addition, to, the, decorative, frame, exerts, pressure, on, the, panel, to, keep, it, from, warping, further, in, 1970, the, beech, crosspieces, were, switched, to, maple, after, it, was, found, that, the, beechwood, had, been, infested, with, insects, in, 2004, 05, a, conservation, and, study, team, replaced, the, maple, crosspieces, with, sycamore, ones, and, an, additional, metal, crosspiece, was, added, for, scientific, measurement, of, the, panel, s, warp, the,

influence, upon, the, evolution, of, the, genre, than, the, mona, lisa, it, became, the, definitive, example, of, the, renaissance, portrait, and, perhaps, for, this, reason, is, seen, not, just, as, the, likeness, of, a, real, person, but, also, as, the, embodiment, of, an, ideal, where, earlier, critics, such, as, vasari, in, the, 16th, century, and, andr, f, libien, in, the, 17th, praised, the, picture, for, its, realism, by, the, mid, 19th, century, writers, began, to, regard, the, mona, lisa, as, imbued, with, a, sense, of, mystery, and, romance, in, 1859, th, ophile, gautier, wrote, that, the, mona, lisa, was, a, sphinx, of, beauty, who, smiles, so, mysteriously, and, that, beneath, the, form, expressed, one, feels, a, thought, that, is, vague, infinite, inexpressible, one, is, moved,

subsequently, described, the, painting, as, the, mona, lisa, of, cubism, the, avant, garde, art, world, has, made, note, of, the, mona, lisa, s, undeniable, popularity, because, of, the, painting, s,

painting, but, until, the, 20th, century, it, was, one, among, many, highly, regarded, artworks, once, part, of, king, francis, i, of, france, s, collection, the, mona, lisa, was, among, the, first, artworks, to, be, exhibited, in, the, louvre, which, became, a, national, museum, after, the, french, revolution, leonardo, began, to, be, revered, as, a, genius, and, the, painting, s, popularity, grew, in, the, mid, 19th, century, when, french, intelligentsia, praised, it, as, mysterious, and, a, representation, of, the, femme, fatale, the, baedeker, guide, in, 1878, called, it, the, most, celebrated, work, of, leonardo, in, the, louvre, but, the, painting, was, known, more, by, the, intelligentsia, than, the, general, public, the, 1911, theft, of, the, mona, lisa, and, its, subsequent, return, was, reported, worldwide, leading, to, a, massive, increase, in, public, recognition, of, the, painting, during, the, 20th, century, it, was, an, object, for, mass, reproduction, merchandising, lampooning, and, speculation, and, was, claimed, to, have, been, reproduced, in, 300, paintings, and, 2, 000, advertisements, the, mona, lisa, was, regarded, as, just, another, leonardo, until, early, last, century, when, the, scandal, of, the, painting, s, theft, from, the, louvre, and, subsequent, return, kept, a, spotlight, on, it, over, several, years, from, december, 1962, to, march, 1963, the, french, government, lent, it, to, the, united, states, to, be, displayed, in, new, york, city, and, washington, d, c, it, was, shipped, on, the, new, ocean, liner, ss, france, in, new, york, an, estimated, 1, 7, million, people, queued, in, order, to, cast, a, glance, at, the, mona, lisa, for, 20, seconds, or, so, while, exhibited, in, the, metropolitan, museum, of, art, the, painting, was, nearly, drenched, in, water, because, of, a, faulty, sprinkler, but, the, painting, s, bullet, proof, glass, case, protected, it, in, 1974, the, painting, was, exhibited, in, tokyo, and, moscow, in, 2014, 9, 3, million, people, visited, the, louvre, former, director, henri, loyrette, reckoned, that, 80, percent, of, the, people, only, want, to, see, the, mona, lisa, before, the, 1962, 1963, tour, the, painting, was, assessed, for, insurance, at, 100, million, equivalent, to, 770, million, in, 2023, making, it, in, practice, the, most, highly, valued, painting, in, the, world, the, insurance, was, not, purchased, instead, more, was, spent, on, security, in, 2014, a, france, 24, article, suggested, that, the, painting, could, be, sold, to, help, ease, the, national, debt, although, it, was, observed, that, the, mona, lisa, and, other, such, art, works, were, prohibited, from, being, sold, by, french, heritage, law, which, states, that, collections,

known, as, mujer, de, mano, de, leonardo, abince, woman, by, leonardo, da, vinci, s, hand, museo, del, prado, madrid, was, for, centuries, considered, to, be, a, work, by, leonardo, however, since, its, restoration, in, 2012, it, is, now, thought, to, have, been, executed, by, one, of, leonardo, s, pupils, in, his, studio, at, the, same, time, as, mona, lisa, was, being, painted, the, prado, s, conclusion, that, the, painting, is, probably, by, sala, 1480, 1524, or, by, melzi, 1493, 1572, has, been, called, into, question, by, others, the, restored, painting, is, from, a, slightly, different, perspective, than, the, original, mona, lisa, leading, to, the, speculation, that, it, is, part, of, the, world, s, first, stereoscopic, pair, however, a, more, recent, report, has, demonstrated, that, this, stereoscopic, pair, in, fact, gives, no, reliable, stereoscopic, depth, a, version, of, the, mona, lisa, known, as, the, isleworth, mona, lisa, was, first, bought, by, an, english, nobleman, in, 1778, and, was, rediscovered, in, 1913, by, hugh, blaker, an, art, connoisseur, the, painting, was, presented, to, the, media, in, 2012, by, the, mona, lisa, foundation, it, is, a, painting, of, the, same, subject, as, leonardo, da, vinci, s, mona, lisa, the, current, scholarly, consensus, on, attribution, is, unclear, some, experts, including, frank, z, llner, martin, kemp, and, luke, syson, denied, the, attribution, to, leonardo, professors, such, as, salvatore, lorusso, andrea, natali, and, john, f, asmus, supported, it, others, like, alessandro, vezzosi, and, carlo, pedretti, were, uncertain, a, version, known, as, the, hermitage, mona, lisa, is, in, the, hermitage, museum, and, it, was, made, by, an, unknown, 16th, century, artist, if, a, person, being, photographed, looks, into, the, camera, lens, the, image, produced, provides, an, illusion, that, viewers, perceive, as, the, subject, looking, at, them, irrespective, of, the, photograph, s, position, it, is, presumably, for, this, reason, that, many, people, while, taking, photographs, ask, subjects, to, look, at, the, camera, rather, than, anywhere, else, in, psychology, this, is, known, as, the, mona, lisa, illusion, which, was, named, after, the, famous, painting, that, also, presents, the, same, illusion
