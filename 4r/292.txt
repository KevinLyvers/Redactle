separately, it, was, only, in, 1794, that, blake, combined, the, two, sets, of, poems, into, a, volume, titled, songs, of, innocence, and, of, experience, shewing, the, two, contrary, states, of, the, human, soul, even, after, beginning, to, print, the, poems, together, blake, continued, to, produce, individual, volumes, for, each, of, the, two, sets, of, poetry, blake, was, also, a, painter, before, the, creation, of, songs, of, innocence, and, of, experience, and, he, engraved, hand, printed, and, colored, detailed, art, to, accompany, each, of, the, poems, in, songs, of, innocence, and, of, experience, this, unique, art, helps, tell, the, story, of, each, poem, and, was, part, of, blake, s, original, vision, for, how, each, poem, should, be, understood, blake, was, heavily, inspired, by, children, s, literature, and, juvenile, education, in, his, creation, of, songs, of, innocence, and, of, experience, and, his, analysis, of, childhood, as, a, state, of, protected, innocence, rather, than, original, sin, but, not, immune, to, the, fallen, world, and, its, institutions, would, soon, become, a, hallmark, of, romanticism, notably, there, has, been, an, abiding, relationship, between, songs, of, innocence, and, of, experience, and, musical, artists, poems, from, the, collection, have, been, set, to, music, by, a, variety, of, musicians, and, band, u2, titled, two, of, their, albums, songs, of, innocence, and, songs, of, experience, in, an, homage, to, this, volume, songs, of, innocence, was, originally, a, complete, collection, of, 23, poems, first, printed, in, 1789, blake, etched, 31, plates, to, create, the, work, and, produced, an, estimated, seventeen, or, eighteen, copies, this, collection, mainly, shows, happy, innocent, perception, in, pastoral, harmony, but, at, times, such, as, in, the, chimney, sweeper, and, the, little, black, boy, subtly, shows, the, dangers, of, this, na, ve, and, vulnerable, state, the, poems, are, listed, below, songs, of, experience, is, a, collection, of, 26, poems, forming, the, second, part, of, songs, of, innocence, and, of, experience, the, poems, were, published, in, 1794, see, 1794, in, poetry, some, of, the, poems, such, as, the, little, girl, lost, and, the, little, girl, found, were, moved, by, blake, to, songs, of, innocence, and, were, frequently, moved, between, the, two, books, the, poems, are, listed, below, blake, was, known, for, his, skill, as, an, artist, and, print, maker, in, addition, to, his, poetry, and, he, combined, these, talents, when, creating, songs, of, innocence, and, experience, each, page, of, songs, of, innocence, and, of, experience, contains, the, text, of, the, poem, surrounded, by, a, unique, illustration, blake, individually, illustrated, these, pages, for, each, binding, he, did, of, the, collection, blake, combined, several, strategies, to, create, each, unique, illustration, he, would, create, a, relief, etched, copper, printing, plate, by, hand, then, paint, each, page, after, printing, using, a, variety, of, mediums, including, watercolor, this, process, meant, that, each, printing, of, songs, of, innocence, and, of, experience, was, visually, distinct, from, the, one, that, came, before, blake, confessed, in, a, letter, that, songs, of, innocence, and, experience, was, an, attempt, to, combine, the, painter, and, the, poet, the, illustrations, in, songs, of, innocence, and, of, experience, do, more, than, simply, depict, what, is, in, the, poem, they, serve, to, intensify, and, translate, the, poems, and, are, central, to, a, full, understanding, of, what, each, poem, attempts, to, convey, the, meaning, of, several, of, the, poems, is, changed, by, the, illustrations, that, accompany, them, with, notable, examples, including, the, blossom, and, the, first, plate, of, the, little, girl, lost, some, of, blake, s, illustrations, have, occasionally, been, critiqued, for, errors, or, lack, of, realism, notable,
