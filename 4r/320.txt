the, piano, is, a, keyboard, instrument, that, produces, sound, when, its, keys, are, depressed, through, engagement, of, an, action, whose, hammers, strike, strings, modern, pianos, have, a, row, of, 88, black, and, white, keys, tuned, to, a, chromatic, scale, in, equal, temperament, there, are, two, main, types, of, piano, the, grand, piano, and, the, upright, piano, the, grand, piano, offers, better, sound, and, more, precise, key, control, making, it, the, preferred, choice, when, space, and, budget, allow, the, grand, piano, is, also, considered, a, necessity, in, venues, hosting, skilled, pianists, the, upright, piano, is, more, commonly, used, due, to, its, smaller, size, and, lower, cost, when, a, key, is, depressed, the, strings, inside, are, struck, by, felt, coated, wooden, hammers, the, vibrations, are, transmitted, through, a, bridge, to, a, soundboard, that, amplifies, the, sound, by, coupling, the, acoustic, energy, to, the, air, when, the, key, is, released, a, damper, stops, the, string, s, vibration, ending, the, sound, most, notes, have, three, strings, except, for, the, bass, which, graduates, from, one, to, two, notes, can, be, sustained, when, the, keys, are, released, by, the, use, of, pedals, at, the, base, of, the, instrument, which, lift, the, dampers, off, the, strings, the, sustain, pedal, allows, pianists, to, connect, and, overlay, sound, and, achieve, expressive, and, colorful, sonority, in, the, nineteenth, century, influenced, by, romantic, music, trends, the, fortepiano, adopted, changes, such, as, using, the, cast, iron, frame, which, allowed, much, greater, string, tensions, and, aliquot, stringing, which, gave, grand, pianos, a, more, powerful, sound, a, longer, sustain, and, a, richer, tone, later, in, the, century, as, the, piano, became, more, common, it, allowed, families, to, listen, to, a, newly, published, musical, piece, by, having, a, family, member, play, a, simplified, version, the, piano, is, widely, employed, in, classical, jazz, traditional, and, popular, music, for, solo, and, ensemble, performances, accompaniment, and, for, composing, songwriting, and, rehearsals, despite, its, weight, and, cost, the, piano, s, versatility, extensive, training, of, musicians, and, widespread, availability, in, venues, schools, and, rehearsal, spaces, have, made, it, a, familiar, instrument, in, the, western, world, the, piano, was, founded, on, earlier, technological, innovations, in, keyboard, instruments, pipe, organs, have, been, used, since, antiquity, and, as, such, the, development, of, pipe, organs, enabled, instrument, builders, to, learn, about, creating, keyboard, mechanisms, for, sounding, pitches, the, first, string, instruments, with, struck, strings, were, the, hammered, dulcimers, which, were, introduced, in, the, middle, ages, in, europe, during, the, middle, ages, there, were, several, attempts, at, creating, stringed, keyboard, instruments, with, struck, strings, by, the, 17th, century, the, mechanisms, of, keyboard, instruments, such, as, the, clavichord, and, the, harpsichord, were, well, developed, in, a, clavichord, the, strings, are, struck, by, tangents, while, in, a, harpsichord, they, are, mechanically, plucked, by, quills, when, the, performer, depresses, the, key, centuries, of, work, on, the, mechanism, of, the, harpsichord, in, particular, had, shown, instrument, builders, the, most, effective, ways, to, construct, the, case, soundboard, bridge, and, mechanical, action, for, a, keyboard, intended, to, sound, strings, the, english, word, piano, is, a, shortened, form, of, the, italian, pianoforte, derived, from, clavicembalo, col, piano, e, forte, key, harpsichord, with, soft, and, loud, variations, in, volume, loudness, are, produced, in, response, to, the, pianist, s, touch, pressure, on, the, keys, the, greater, the, pressure, the, greater, the, force, of, the, hammer, hitting, the, strings, and, the, louder, the, sound, produced, and, the, stronger, the, attack, invented, in, the, 1700s, the, fortepiano, was, the, first, keyboard, instrument, to, allow, gradations, of, volume, and, tone, according, to, how, forcefully, or, softly, the, player, presses, or, strikes, the, keys, unlike, the, pipe, organ, and, harpsichord, the, invention, of, the, piano, is, credited, to, bartolomeo, cristofori, 1655, 1731, of, padua, italy, who, was, employed, by, ferdinando, de, medici, grand, prince, of, tuscany, as, the, keeper, of, the, instruments, cristofori, was, an, expert, harpsichord, maker, and, was, well, acquainted, with, the, body, of, knowledge, on, stringed, keyboard, instruments, this, knowledge, of, keyboard, mechanisms, and, actions, helped, him, to, develop, the, first, pianos, it, is, not, known, exactly, when, cristofori, first, built, a, piano, an, inventory, made, by, his, employers, the, medici, family, indicates, the, existence, of, a, piano, by, the, year, 1700, the, three, cristofori, pianos, that, survive, today, date, from, the, 1720s, cristofori, named, the, instrument, un, cimbalo, di, cipresso, di, piano, e, forte, a, keyboard, of, cypress, with, soft, and, loud, abbreviated, over, time, as, pianoforte, fortepiano, and, later, simply, piano, cristofori, s, great, success, was, designing, a, stringed, keyboard, instrument, in, which, the, notes, are, struck, by, a, hammer, the, hammer, must, strike, the, string, but, not, remain, in, contact, with, it, because, continued, contact, would, damp, the, sound, and, stop, the, string, from, vibrating, and, making, sound, this, means, that, after, striking, the, string, the, hammer, must, quickly, fall, from, or, rebound, from, the, strings, moreover, the, hammer, must, return, to, its, rest, position, without, bouncing, violently, thus, preventing, notes, from, being, re, played, by, accidental, rebound, and, it, must, return, to, a, position, in, which, it, is, ready, to, play, again, almost, immediately, after, its, key, is, depressed, so, the, player, can, repeat, the, same, note, rapidly, when, desired, cristofori, s, piano, action, was, a, model, for, the, many, approaches, to, piano, actions, that, followed, in, the, next, century, cristofori, s, early, instruments, were, made, with, thin, strings, and, were, much, quieter, than, the, modern, piano, but, they, were, much, louder, and, with, more, sustain, in, comparison, to, the, clavichord, the, only, previous, keyboard, instrument, capable, of, dynamic, nuance, responding, to, the, player, s, touch, the, velocity, with, which, the, keys, are, pressed, while, the, clavichord, allows, expressive, control, of, volume, and, sustain, it, is, relatively, quiet, even, at, its, loudest, the, harpsichord, produces, a, sufficiently, loud, sound, especially, when, a, coupler, joins, each, key, to, both, manuals, of, a, two, manual, harpsichord, but, it, offers, no, dynamic, or, expressive, control, over, individual, notes, the, piano, in, some, sense, offers, the, best, of, both, of, the, older, instruments, combining, the, ability, to, play, at, least, as, loudly, as, a, harpsichord, with, the, ability, to, continuously, vary, dynamics, by, touch, cristofori, s, new, instrument, remained, relatively, unknown, until, an, italian, writer, scipione, maffei, wrote, an, enthusiastic, article, about, it, in, 1711, including, a, diagram, of, the, mechanism, that, was, translated, into, german, and, widely, distributed, most, of, the, next, generation, of, piano, builders, started, their, work, based, on, reading, this, article, one, of, these, builders, was, gottfried, silbermann, better, known, as, an, organ, builder, silbermann, s, pianos, were, virtually, direct, copies, of, cristofori, s, with, one, important, addition, silbermann, invented, the, forerunner, of, the, modern, sustain, pedal, which, lifts, all, the, dampers, from, the, strings, simultaneously, this, innovation, allows, the, pianist, to, sustain, the, notes, that, they, have, depressed, even, after, their, fingers, are, no, longer, pressing, down, the, keys, as, such, by, holding, a, chord, with, the, sustain, pedal, pianists, can, relocate, their, hands, to, a, different, register, of, the, keyboard, in, preparation, for, a, subsequent, section, silbermann, showed, johann, sebastian, bach, one, of, his, early, instruments, in, the, 1730s, but, bach, did, not, like, the, instrument, at, that, time, saying, that, the, higher, notes, were, too, soft, to, allow, a, full, dynamic, range, although, this, earned, him, some, animosity, from, silbermann, the, criticism, was, apparently, heeded, bach, did, approve, of, a, later, instrument, he, saw, in, 1747, and, even, served, as, an, agent, in, selling, silbermann, s, pianos, instrument, piano, et, forte, genandt, a, reference, to, the, instrument, s, ability, to, play, soft, and, loud, was, an, expression, that, bach, used, to, help, sell, the, instrument, when, he, was, acting, as, silbermann, s, agent, in, 1749, piano, making, flourished, during, the, late, 18th, century, in, the, viennese, school, which, included, johann, andreas, stein, who, worked, in, augsburg, germany, and, the, viennese, makers, nannette, streicher, daughter, of, stein, and, anton, walter, viennese, style, pianos, were, built, with, wood, frames, two, strings, per, note, and, leather, covered, hammers, some, of, these, viennese, pianos, had, the, opposite, coloring, of, modern, day, pianos, the, natural, keys, were, black, and, the, accidental, keys, white, it, was, for, such, instruments, that, wolfgang, amadeus, mozart, composed, his, concertos, and, sonatas, and, replicas, of, them, are, built, in, the, 21st, century, for, use, in, authentic, instrument, performance, of, his, music, the, pianos, of, mozart, s, day, had, a, softer, tone, than, 21st, century, pianos, or, english, pianos, with, less, sustaining, power, the, term, fortepiano, now, distinguishes, these, early, instruments, and, modern, re, creations, from, later, pianos, in, the, period, from, about, 1790, to, 1860, the, mozart, era, piano, underwent, tremendous, changes, that, led, to, the, modern, structure, of, the, instrument, this, revolution, was, in, response, to, a, preference, by, composers, and, pianists, for, a, more, powerful, sustained, piano, sound, and, made, possible, by, the, ongoing, industrial, revolution, with, resources, such, as, high, quality, piano, wire, for, strings, and, precision, casting, for, the, production, of, massive, iron, frames, that, could, withstand, the, tremendous, tension, of, the, strings, over, time, the, tonal, range, of, the, piano, was, also, increased, from, the, five, octaves, of, mozart, s, day, to, the, seven, octave, or, more, range, found, on, today, s, pianos, early, technological, progress, in, the, late, 1700s, owed, much, to, the, firm, of, broadwood, john, broadwood, joined, with, another, scot, robert, stodart, and, a, dutchman, americus, backers, to, design, a, piano, in, the, harpsichord, case, the, origin, of, the, grand, this, was, achieved, by, about, 1777, they, quickly, gained, a, reputation, for, the, splendour, and, powerful, tone, of, their, instruments, with, broadwood, constructing, pianos, that, were, progressively, larger, louder, and, more, robustly, constructed, they, sent, pianos, to, both, joseph, haydn, and, ludwig, van, beethoven, and, were, the, first, firm, to, build, pianos, with, a, range, of, more, than, five, octaves, five, octaves, and, a, fifth, during, the, 1790s, six, octaves, by, 1810, beethoven, used, the, extra, notes, in, his, later, works, and, seven, octaves, by, 1820, the, viennese, makers, similarly, followed, these, trends, however, the, two, schools, used, different, piano, actions, broadwoods, used, a, more, robust, action, whereas, viennese, instruments, were, more, sensitive, by, the, 1820s, the, center, of, piano, innovation, had, shifted, to, paris, where, the, pleyel, firm, manufactured, pianos, used, by, fr, d, ric, chopin, and, the, rard, firm, manufactured, those, used, by, franz, liszt, in, 1821, s, bastien, rard, invented, the, double, escapement, action, which, incorporated, a, repetition, lever, also, called, the, balancier, that, permitted, repeating, a, note, even, if, the, key, had, not, yet, risen, to, its, maximum, vertical, position, this, facilitated, rapid, playing, of, repeated, notes, a, musical, device, exploited, by, liszt, when, the, invention, became, public, as, revised, by, henri, herz, the, double, escapement, action, gradually, became, standard, in, grand, pianos, and, is, still, incorporated, into, all, grand, pianos, currently, produced, in, the, 2000s, other, improvements, of, the, mechanism, included, the, use, of, firm, felt, hammer, coverings, instead, of, layered, leather, or, cotton, felt, which, jean, henri, pape, was, the, first, to, use, in, pianos, in, 1826, was, a, more, consistent, material, permitting, wider, dynamic, ranges, as, hammer, weights, and, string, tension, increased, the, sostenuto, pedal, see, below, invented, in, 1844, by, jean, louis, boisselot, and, copied, by, the, steinway, firm, in, 1874, allowed, a, wider, range, of, effects, one, innovation, that, helped, create, the, powerful, sound, of, the, modern, piano, was, the, use, of, a, massive, strong, cast, iron, frame, also, called, the, plate, the, iron, frame, sits, atop, the, soundboard, and, serves, as, the, primary, bulwark, against, the, force, of, string, tension, that, can, exceed, 20, tons, 180, kilonewtons, in, a, modern, grand, piano, the, single, piece, cast, iron, frame, was, patented, in, 1825, in, boston, by, alpheus, babcock, combining, the, metal, hitch, pin, plate, 1821, claimed, by, broadwood, on, behalf, of, samuel, herv, and, resisting, bars, thom, and, allen, 1820, but, also, claimed, by, broadwood, and, rard, babcock, later, worked, for, the, chickering, mackays, firm, who, patented, the, first, full, iron, frame, for, grand, pianos, in, 1843, composite, forged, metal, frames, were, preferred, by, many, european, makers, until, the, american, system, was, fully, adopted, by, the, early, 20th, century, the, increased, structural, integrity, of, the, iron, frame, allowed, the, use, of, thicker, tenser, and, more, numerous, strings, in, 1834, the, webster, horsfal, firm, of, birmingham, brought, out, a, form, of, piano, wire, made, from, cast, steel, it, was, so, superior, to, the, iron, wire, that, the, english, firm, soon, had, a, monopoly, but, a, better, steel, wire, was, soon, created, in, 1840, by, the, viennese, firm, of, martin, miller, and, a, period, of, innovation, and, intense, competition, ensued, with, rival, brands, of, piano, wire, being, tested, against, one, another, at, international, competitions, leading, ultimately, to, the, modern, form, of, piano, wire, several, important, advances, included, changes, to, the, way, the, piano, was, strung, the, use, of, a, choir, of, three, strings, rather, than, two, for, all, but, the, lowest, notes, enhanced, the, richness, and, complexity, of, the, treble, the, use, of, a, capo, d, astro, bar, instead, of, agraffes, in, the, uppermost, treble, allowed, the, hammers, to, strike, the, strings, in, their, optimal, position, greatly, increasing, that, area, s, power, the, implementation, of, over, stringing, also, called, cross, stringing, in, which, the, strings, are, placed, in, two, separate, planes, each, with, its, own, bridge, height, allowed, greater, length, to, the, bass, strings, and, optimized, the, transition, from, unwound, tenor, strings, to, the, iron, or, copper, wound, bass, strings, over, stringing, was, invented, by, pape, during, the, 1820s, and, first, patented, for, use, in, grand, pianos, in, the, united, states, by, henry, steinway, jr, in, 1859, some, piano, makers, added, variations, to, enhance, the, tone, of, each, note, such, as, pascal, taskin, 1788, collard, collard, 1821, and, julius, bl, thner, who, developed, aliquot, stringing, in, 1893, these, systems, were, used, to, strengthen, the, tone, of, the, highest, register, of, notes, on, the, piano, which, up, until, this, time, were, viewed, as, being, too, weak, sounding, each, used, more, distinctly, ringing, undamped, vibrations, of, sympathetically, vibrating, strings, to, add, to, the, tone, except, the, bl, thner, aliquot, stringing, which, uses, an, additional, fourth, string, in, the, upper, two, treble, sections, while, the, hitchpins, of, these, separately, suspended, aliquot, strings, are, raised, slightly, above, the, level, of, the, usual, tri, choir, strings, they, are, not, struck, by, the, hammers, but, rather, are, damped, by, attachments, of, the, usual, dampers, eager, to, copy, these, effects, theodore, steinway, invented, duplex, scaling, which, used, short, lengths, of, non, speaking, wire, bridged, by, the, aliquot, throughout, much, of, the, upper, range, of, the, piano, always, in, locations, that, caused, them, to, vibrate, sympathetically, in, conformity, with, their, respective, overtones, typically, in, doubled, octaves, and, twelfths, some, early, pianos, had, shapes, and, designs, that, are, no, longer, in, use, the, square, piano, not, truly, square, but, rectangular, was, cross, strung, at, an, extremely, acute, angle, above, the, hammers, with, the, keyboard, set, along, the, long, side, this, design, is, attributed, to, christian, ernst, friderici, a, pupil, of, gottfried, silbermann, in, germany, and, johannes, zumpe, in, england, and, it, was, improved, by, changes, first, introduced, by, guillaume, lebrecht, petzold, in, france, and, alpheus, babcock, in, the, united, states, square, pianos, were, built, in, great, numbers, through, the, 1840s, in, europe, and, the, 1890s, in, the, united, states, and, saw, the, most, visible, change, of, any, type, of, piano, the, iron, framed, over, strung, squares, manufactured, by, steinway, sons, were, more, than, two, and, a, half, times, the, size, of, zumpe, s, wood, framed, instruments, from, a, century, before, their, overwhelming, popularity, was, due, to, inexpensive, construction, and, price, although, their, tone, and, performance, were, limited, by, narrow, soundboards, simple, actions, and, string, spacing, that, made, proper, hammer, alignment, difficult, the, tall, vertically, strung, upright, grand, was, arranged, like, a, grand, set, on, end, with, the, soundboard, and, bridges, above, the, keys, and, tuning, pins, below, them, giraffe, pianos, pyramid, pianos, and, lyre, pianos, were, arranged, in, a, somewhat, similar, fashion, using, evocatively, shaped, cases, the, very, tall, cabinet, piano, was, introduced, about, 1805, and, was, built, through, the, 1840s, it, had, strings, arranged, vertically, on, a, continuous, frame, with, bridges, extended, nearly, to, the, floor, behind, the, keyboard, and, very, large, sticker, action, the, short, cottage, upright, or, pianino, with, vertical, stringing, made, popular, by, robert, wornum, around, 1815, was, built, into, the, 20th, century, they, are, informally, called, birdcage, pianos, because, of, their, prominent, damper, mechanism, the, oblique, upright, popularized, in, france, by, roller, blanchet, during, the, late, 1820s, was, diagonally, strung, throughout, its, compass, the, tiny, spinet, upright, was, manufactured, from, the, mid, 1930s, until, recent, times, the, low, position, of, the, hammers, required, the, use, of, a, drop, action, to, preserve, a, reasonable, keyboard, height, modern, upright, and, grand, pianos, attained, their, present, 2000, era, forms, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, while, improvements, have, been, made, in, manufacturing, processes, and, many, individual, details, of, the, instrument, continue, to, receive, attention, and, a, small, number, of, acoustic, pianos, in, the, 2010s, are, produced, with, midi, recording, and, digital, sound, module, triggering, capabilities, the, 19th, century, was, the, era, of, the, most, dramatic, innovations, and, modifications, of, the, instrument, modern, pianos, have, two, basic, configurations, the, grand, piano, and, the, upright, piano, with, various, styles, of, each, there, are, also, specialized, and, novelty, pianos, electric, pianos, based, on, electromechanical, designs, electronic, pianos, that, synthesize, piano, like, tones, using, oscillators, and, digital, pianos, using, digital, samples, of, acoustic, piano, sounds, in, grand, pianos, the, frame, and, strings, are, horizontal, with, the, strings, extending, away, from, the, keyboard, the, action, lies, beneath, the, strings, and, uses, gravity, as, its, means, of, return, to, a, state, of, rest, grand, pianos, range, in, length, from, approximately, 1, 5, 3, m, 4, ft, 11, in, 9, ft, 10, in, some, of, the, lengths, have, been, given, more, or, less, customary, names, which, vary, from, time, to, time, and, place, to, place, but, might, include, all, else, being, equal, longer, pianos, with, longer, strings, have, larger, richer, sound, and, lower, inharmonicity, of, the, strings, inharmonicity, is, the, degree, to, which, the, frequencies, of, overtones, known, as, partials, or, harmonics, sound, sharp, relative, to, whole, multiples, of, the, fundamental, frequency, this, results, from, the, piano, s, considerable, string, stiffness, as, a, struck, string, decays, its, harmonics, vibrate, not, from, their, termination, but, from, a, point, very, slightly, toward, the, center, or, more, flexible, part, of, the, string, the, higher, the, partial, the, further, sharp, it, runs, pianos, with, shorter, and, thicker, string, i, e, small, pianos, with, short, string, scales, have, more, inharmonicity, the, greater, the, inharmonicity, the, more, the, ear, perceives, it, as, harshness, of, tone, the, inharmonicity, of, piano, strings, requires, that, octaves, be, stretched, or, tuned, to, a, lower, octave, s, corresponding, sharp, overtone, rather, than, to, a, theoretically, correct, octave, if, octaves, are, not, stretched, single, octaves, sound, in, tune, but, double, and, notably, triple, octaves, are, unacceptably, narrow, stretching, a, small, piano, s, octaves, to, match, its, inherent, inharmonicity, level, creates, an, imbalance, among, all, the, instrument, s, intervallic, relationships, in, a, concert, grand, however, the, octave, stretch, retains, harmonic, balance, even, when, aligning, treble, notes, to, a, harmonic, produced, from, three, octaves, below, this, lets, close, and, widespread, octaves, sound, pure, and, produces, virtually, beatless, perfect, fifths, this, gives, the, concert, grand, a, brilliant, singing, and, sustaining, tone, quality, one, of, the, principal, reasons, that, full, size, grands, are, used, in, the, concert, hall, smaller, grands, satisfy, the, space, and, cost, needs, of, domestic, use, as, well, they, are, used, in, some, small, teaching, studios, and, smaller, performance, venues, upright, pianos, also, called, vertical, pianos, are, more, compact, due, to, the, vertical, structure, of, the, frame, and, strings, the, mechanical, action, structure, of, the, upright, piano, was, invented, in, london, england, in, 1826, by, robert, wornum, and, upright, models, became, the, most, popular, model, for, domestic, use, upright, pianos, took, less, space, than, a, grand, piano, and, as, such, they, were, a, better, size, for, use, in, private, homes, for, domestic, music, making, and, practice, the, hammers, move, horizontally, and, return, to, their, resting, position, via, springs, which, are, susceptible, to, degradation, upright, pianos, with, unusually, tall, frames, and, long, strings, were, sometimes, marketed, as, upright, grand, pianos, but, that, label, is, misleading, some, authors, classify, modern, pianos, according, to, their, height, and, to, modifications, of, the, action, that, are, necessary, to, accommodate, the, height, upright, pianos, are, generally, less, expensive, than, grand, pianos, upright, pianos, are, widely, used, in, churches, community, centers, schools, music, conservatories, and, university, music, programs, as, rehearsal, and, practice, instruments, and, they, are, popular, models, for, in, home, purchase, the, toy, piano, introduced, in, the, 19th, century, is, a, small, piano, like, instrument, that, generally, uses, round, metal, rods, to, produce, sound, rather, than, strings, the, us, library, of, congress, recognizes, the, toy, piano, as, a, unique, instrument, with, the, subject, designation, toy, piano, scores, m175, t69, in, 1863, henri, fourneaux, invented, the, player, piano, which, plays, itself, from, a, piano, roll, a, machine, perforates, a, performance, recording, into, rolls, of, paper, and, the, player, piano, replays, the, performance, using, pneumatic, devices, modern, equivalents, of, the, player, piano, include, the, b, sendorfer, ceus, yamaha, disklavier, and, qrs, pianomation, using, solenoids, and, midi, rather, than, pneumatics, and, rolls, a, silent, piano, is, an, acoustic, piano, having, an, option, to, silence, the, strings, by, means, of, an, interposing, hammer, bar, they, are, designed, for, private, silent, practice, to, avoid, disturbing, others, edward, ryley, invented, the, transposing, piano, in, 1801, this, rare, instrument, has, a, lever, under, the, keyboard, to, move, the, keyboard, relative, to, the, strings, so, a, pianist, can, play, in, a, familiar, key, while, the, music, sounds, in, a, different, key, the, minipiano, is, an, instrument, patented, by, the, brasted, brothers, of, the, eavestaff, ltd, piano, company, in, 1934, this, instrument, has, a, braceless, back, and, a, soundboard, positioned, below, the, keys, long, metal, rods, pull, on, the, levers, to, make, the, hammers, strike, the, strings, the, first, model, known, as, the, pianette, was, unique, in, that, the, tuning, pins, extended, through, the, instrument, so, it, could, be, tuned, at, the, front, the, prepared, piano, present, in, some, contemporary, art, music, from, the, 20th, and, 21st, century, is, a, piano, which, has, objects, placed, inside, it, to, alter, its, sound, or, has, had, its, mechanism, changed, in, some, other, way, the, scores, for, music, for, prepared, piano, specify, the, modifications, for, example, instructing, the, pianist, to, insert, pieces, of, rubber, paper, metal, screws, or, washers, in, between, the, strings, these, objects, mute, the, strings, or, alter, their, timbre, the, pedal, piano, is, a, rare, type, of, piano, that, has, a, pedal, keyboard, at, the, base, designed, to, be, played, by, the, feet, the, pedals, may, play, the, existing, bass, strings, on, the, piano, or, rarely, the, pedals, may, have, their, own, set, of, bass, strings, and, hammer, mechanisms, while, the, typical, intended, use, for, pedal, pianos, is, to, enable, a, keyboardist, to, practice, pipe, organ, music, at, home, a, few, players, of, pedal, piano, use, it, as, a, performance, instrument, wadia, sabra, had, a, microtone, piano, manufactured, by, pleyel, in, 1920, abdallah, chahine, later, constructed, his, quartertone, oriental, piano, with, the, help, of, austrian, hofmann, with, technological, advances, amplified, electric, pianos, 1929, electronic, pianos, 1970s, and, digital, pianos, 1980s, have, been, developed, the, electric, piano, became, a, popular, instrument, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, genres, of, jazz, fusion, funk, music, and, rock, music, the, first, electric, pianos, from, the, late, 1920s, used, metal, strings, with, a, magnetic, pickup, an, amplifier, and, a, loudspeaker, the, electric, pianos, that, became, most, popular, in, pop, and, rock, music, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, such, as, the, fender, rhodes, use, metal, tines, in, place, of, strings, and, use, electromagnetic, pickups, similar, to, those, on, an, electric, guitar, the, resulting, electrical, analogue, signal, can, then, be, amplified, with, a, keyboard, amplifier, or, electronically, manipulated, with, effects, units, in, classical, music, electric, pianos, are, mainly, used, as, inexpensive, rehearsal, or, practice, instruments, however, electric, pianos, particularly, the, fender, rhodes, became, important, instruments, in, 1970s, funk, and, jazz, fusion, and, in, some, rock, music, genres, electronic, pianos, are, non, acoustic, they, do, not, have, strings, tines, or, hammers, but, are, a, type, of, analog, synthesizer, that, simulates, or, imitates, piano, sounds, using, oscillators, and, filters, that, synthesize, the, sound, of, an, acoustic, piano, they, must, be, connected, to, a, keyboard, amplifier, and, speaker, to, produce, sound, however, some, electronic, keyboards, have, a, built, in, amp, and, speaker, alternatively, a, person, can, play, an, electronic, piano, with, headphones, in, quieter, settings, digital, pianos, are, also, non, acoustic, and, do, not, have, strings, or, hammers, they, use, digital, audio, sampling, technology, to, reproduce, the, acoustic, sound, of, each, piano, note, accurately, they, also, must, be, connected, to, a, power, amplifier, and, speaker, to, produce, sound, however, most, digital, pianos, have, a, built, in, amp, and, speaker, alternatively, a, person, can, practise, with, headphones, to, avoid, disturbing, others, digital, pianos, can, include, sustain, pedals, weighted, or, semi, weighted, keys, multiple, voice, options, e, g, sampled, or, synthesized, imitations, of, electric, piano, hammond, organ, violin, etc, and, midi, interfaces, midi, inputs, and, outputs, connect, a, digital, piano, to, other, electronic, instruments, or, musical, devices, for, example, a, digital, piano, s, midi, out, signal, could, be, connected, by, a, patch, cord, to, a, synth, module, which, would, allow, the, performer, to, use, the, keyboard, of, the, digital, piano, to, play, modern, synthesizer, sounds, early, digital, pianos, tended, to, lack, a, full, set, of, pedals, but, the, synthesis, software, of, later, models, such, as, the, yamaha, clavinova, series, synthesised, the, sympathetic, vibration, of, the, other, strings, such, as, when, the, sustain, pedal, is, depressed, and, full, pedal, sets, can, now, be, replicated, the, processing, power, of, digital, pianos, has, enabled, highly, realistic, pianos, using, multi, gigabyte, piano, sample, sets, with, as, many, as, ninety, recordings, each, lasting, many, seconds, for, each, key, under, different, conditions, e, g, there, are, samples, of, each, note, being, struck, softly, loudly, with, a, sharp, attack, etc, additional, samples, emulate, sympathetic, resonance, of, the, strings, when, the, sustain, pedal, is, depressed, key, release, the, drop, of, the, dampers, and, simulations, of, techniques, such, as, re, pedalling, digital, midi, equipped, pianos, can, output, a, stream, of, midi, data, or, record, and, play, midi, format, files, on, digital, storage, media, previously, floppy, disks, or, cd, roms, now, often, usb, flash, drives, similar, in, concept, to, a, pianola, the, midi, file, records, the, physics, of, a, note, rather, than, its, resulting, sound, and, recreates, the, sounds, from, its, physical, properties, e, g, which, note, was, struck, and, with, what, velocity, computer, based, software, such, as, modartt, s, 2006, pianoteq, can, be, used, to, manipulate, the, midi, stream, in, real, time, or, subsequently, to, edit, it, this, type, of, software, may, use, no, samples, but, synthesize, a, sound, based, on, aspects, of, the, physics, that, went, into, the, creation, of, a, played, note, in, the, 2000s, some, pianos, include, an, acoustic, grand, piano, or, upright, piano, combined, with, midi, electronic, features, such, a, piano, can, be, played, acoustically, or, the, keyboard, can, be, used, as, a, midi, controller, which, can, trigger, a, synthesizer, module, or, music, sampler, some, electronic, feature, equipped, pianos, such, as, the, yamaha, disklavier, electronic, player, piano, introduced, in, 1987, are, outfitted, with, electronic, sensors, for, recording, and, electromechanical, solenoids, for, player, piano, style, playback, sensors, record, the, movements, of, the, keys, hammers, and, pedals, during, a, performance, and, the, system, saves, the, performance, data, as, a, standard, midi, file, smf, on, playback, the, solenoids, move, the, keys, and, pedals, and, thus, reproduce, the, original, performance, modern, disklaviers, typically, include, an, array, of, electronic, features, such, as, a, built, in, tone, generator, for, playing, back, midi, accompaniment, tracks, speakers, midi, connectivity, that, supports, communication, with, computing, devices, and, external, midi, instruments, additional, ports, for, audio, and, smpte, input, output, i, o, and, internet, connectivity, disklaviers, have, been, manufactured, in, the, form, of, upright, baby, grand, and, grand, piano, styles, including, a, nine, foot, concert, grand, reproducing, systems, have, ranged, from, relatively, simple, playback, only, models, to, professional, models, that, can, record, performance, data, at, resolutions, that, exceed, the, limits, of, normal, midi, data, the, unit, mounted, under, the, keyboard, of, the, piano, can, play, midi, or, audio, software, on, its, cd, pianos, can, have, over, 12, 000, individual, parts, supporting, six, functional, features, keyboard, hammers, dampers, bridge, soundboard, and, strings, many, parts, of, a, piano, are, made, of, materials, selected, for, strength, and, longevity, this, is, especially, true, of, the, outer, rim, it, is, most, commonly, made, of, hardwood, typically, hard, maple, or, beech, and, its, massiveness, serves, as, an, essentially, immobile, object, from, which, the, flexible, soundboard, can, best, vibrate, according, to, harold, a, conklin, the, purpose, of, a, sturdy, rim, is, so, that, the, vibrational, energy, will, stay, as, much, as, possible, in, the, soundboard, instead, of, dissipating, uselessly, in, the, case, parts, which, are, inefficient, radiators, of, sound, hardwood, rims, are, commonly, made, by, laminating, thin, hence, flexible, strips, of, hardwood, bending, them, to, the, desired, shape, immediately, after, the, application, of, glue, the, bent, plywood, system, was, developed, by, c, f, theodore, steinway, in, 1880, to, reduce, manufacturing, time, and, costs, previously, the, rim, was, constructed, from, several, pieces, of, solid, wood, joined, and, veneered, and, european, makers, used, this, method, well, into, the, 20th, century, a, modern, exception, b, sendorfer, the, austrian, manufacturer, of, high, quality, pianos, constructs, their, inner, rims, from, solid, spruce, the, same, wood, that, the, soundboard, is, made, from, which, is, notched, to, allow, it, to, bend, rather, than, isolating, the, rim, from, vibration, their, resonance, case, principle, allows, the, framework, to, resonate, more, freely, with, the, soundboard, creating, additional, coloration, and, complexity, of, the, overall, sound, the, thick, wooden, posts, on, the, underside, grands, or, back, uprights, of, the, piano, stabilize, the, rim, structure, and, are, made, of, softwood, for, stability, the, requirement, of, structural, strength, fulfilled, by, stout, hardwood, and, thick, metal, makes, a, piano, heavy, even, a, small, upright, can, weigh, 136, kg, 300, lb, and, the, steinway, concert, grand, model, d, weighs, 480, kg, 1, 060, lb, the, largest, piano, available, on, the, general, market, the, fazioli, f308, weighs, 570, kg, 1, 260, lb, the, pinblock, which, holds, the, tuning, pins, in, place, is, another, area, where, toughness, is, important, it, is, made, of, hardwood, typically, hard, maple, or, beech, and, is, laminated, for, strength, stability, and, longevity, piano, strings, also, called, piano, wire, which, must, endure, years, of, extreme, tension, and, hard, blows, are, made, of, high, carbon, steel, they, are, manufactured, to, vary, as, little, as, possible, in, diameter, since, all, deviations, from, uniformity, introduce, tonal, distortion, the, bass, strings, of, a, piano, are, made, of, a, steel, core, wrapped, with, copper, wire, to, increase, their, mass, whilst, retaining, flexibility, if, all, strings, throughout, the, piano, s, compass, were, individual, monochord, the, massive, bass, strings, would, overpower, the, upper, ranges, makers, compensate, for, this, with, the, use, of, double, bichord, strings, in, the, tenor, and, triple, trichord, strings, throughout, the, treble, the, plate, harp, or, metal, frame, of, a, piano, is, usually, made, of, cast, iron, a, massive, plate, is, advantageous, since, the, strings, vibrate, from, the, plate, at, both, ends, an, insufficiently, massive, plate, would, absorb, too, much, of, the, vibrational, energy, that, should, go, through, the, bridge, to, the, soundboard, while, some, manufacturers, use, cast, steel, in, their, plates, most, prefer, cast, iron, cast, iron, is, easy, to, cast, and, machine, has, flexibility, sufficient, for, piano, use, is, much, more, resistant, to, deformation, than, steel, and, is, especially, tolerant, of, compression, plate, casting, is, an, art, since, dimensions, are, crucial, and, the, iron, shrinks, about, one, percent, during, cooling, including, an, extremely, large, piece, of, metal, in, a, piano, is, potentially, an, aesthetic, handicap, piano, makers, overcome, this, by, polishing, painting, and, decorating, the, plate, plates, often, include, the, manufacturer, s, ornamental, medallion, in, an, effort, to, make, pianos, lighter, alcoa, worked, with, winter, and, company, piano, manufacturers, to, make, pianos, using, an, aluminum, plate, during, the, 1940s, aluminum, piano, plates, were, not, widely, accepted, and, were, discontinued, prior, to, this, a, piano, made, almost, entirely, of, aluminum, was, placed, aboard, the, airship, hindenburg, the, numerous, parts, of, a, piano, action, are, generally, made, from, hardwood, such, as, maple, beech, and, hornbeam, however, since, world, war, ii, makers, have, also, incorporated, plastics, early, plastics, used, in, some, pianos, in, the, late, 1940s, and, 1950s, proved, disastrous, when, they, lost, strength, after, a, few, decades, of, use, beginning, in, 1961, the, new, york, branch, of, the, steinway, firm, incorporated, teflon, a, synthetic, material, developed, by, dupont, for, some, parts, of, its, permafree, grand, action, in, place, of, cloth, bushings, but, abandoned, the, experiment, in, 1982, due, to, excessive, friction, and, a, clicking, that, developed, over, time, teflon, is, humidity, stable, whereas, the, wood, adjacent, to, the, teflon, swells, and, shrinks, with, humidity, changes, causing, problems, more, recently, the, kawai, firm, built, pianos, with, action, parts, made, of, more, modern, materials, such, as, carbon, fiber, reinforced, plastic, and, the, piano, parts, manufacturer, wessell, nickel, and, gross, has, launched, a, new, line, of, carefully, engineered, composite, parts, thus, far, these, parts, have, performed, reasonably, but, it, will, take, decades, to, know, if, they, equal, the, longevity, of, wood, in, all, but, the, lowest, quality, pianos, the, soundboard, is, made, of, solid, spruce, that, is, spruce, boards, glued, together, along, the, side, grain, spruce, s, high, ratio, of, strength, to, weight, minimizes, acoustic, impedance, while, offering, strength, sufficient, to, withstand, the, downward, force, of, the, strings, the, best, piano, makers, use, quarter, sawn, defect, free, spruce, of, close, annular, grain, carefully, seasoning, it, over, a, long, period, before, fabricating, the, soundboards, this, is, the, identical, material, that, is, used, in, quality, acoustic, guitar, soundboards, cheap, pianos, often, have, plywood, soundboards, the, design, of, the, piano, hammers, requires, having, the, hammer, felt, be, soft, enough, so, that, it, will, not, create, loud, very, high, harmonics, that, a, hard, hammer, will, cause, the, hammer, must, be, lightweight, enough, to, move, swiftly, when, a, key, is, pressed, yet, at, the, same, time, it, must, be, strong, enough, so, that, it, can, hit, strings, hard, when, the, player, strikes, the, keys, forcefully, for, fortissimo, playing, or, sforzando, accents, in, the, early, years, of, piano, construction, keys, were, commonly, made, from, sugar, pine, in, the, 2010s, they, are, usually, made, of, spruce, or, basswood, spruce, is, typically, used, in, high, quality, pianos, black, keys, were, traditionally, made, of, ebony, and, the, white, keys, were, covered, with, strips, of, ivory, however, since, ivory, yielding, species, are, now, endangered, and, protected, by, treaty, or, are, illegal, in, some, countries, makers, use, plastics, almost, exclusively, also, ivory, tends, to, chip, more, easily, than, plastic, legal, ivory, can, still, be, obtained, in, limited, quantities, yamaha, developed, a, plastic, called, ivorite, intended, to, mimic, the, look, and, feel, of, ivory, other, manufacturers, have, done, likewise, almost, every, modern, piano, has, 52, white, keys, and, 36, black, keys, for, a, total, of, 88, keys, seven, octaves, plus, a, minor, third, from, a, 0, to, c, 8, many, older, pianos, only, have, 85, keys, seven, octaves, from, a, 0, to, a, 7, some, piano, manufacturers, have, extended, the, range, further, in, one, or, both, directions, for, example, the, imperial, b, sendorfer, has, nine, extra, keys, at, the, bass, end, giving, a, total, of, 97, keys, and, an, eight, octave, range, these, extra, keys, are, sometimes, hidden, under, a, small, hinged, lid, that, can, cover, the, keys, to, prevent, visual, disorientation, for, pianists, unfamiliar, with, the, extra, keys, or, the, colours, of, the, extra, white, keys, are, reversed, black, instead, of, white, more, recently, australian, manufacturer, stuart, sons, created, a, piano, with, 108, keys, going, from, c, 0, to, b, 8, covering, nine, full, octaves, the, extra, keys, are, the, same, as, the, other, keys, in, appearance, the, extra, keys, are, added, primarily, for, increased, resonance, from, the, associated, strings, that, is, they, vibrate, sympathetically, with, other, strings, whenever, the, damper, pedal, is, depressed, and, thus, give, a, fuller, tone, only, a, very, small, number, of, works, composed, for, piano, actually, use, these, notes, toy, piano, company, schoenhut, manufactures, grands, and, uprights, with, only, 44, or, 49, keys, and, a, shorter, distance, between, the, keyboard, and, the, pedals, these, are, true, pianos, with, working, mechanisms, and, strings, a, rare, variant, of, the, piano, called, the, em, nuel, mo, r, pianoforte, has, double, keyboards, one, lying, above, the, other, it, was, invented, by, hungarian, composer, and, pianist, em, nuel, mo, r, 19, february, 1863, 20, october, 1931, the, lower, keyboard, has, the, usual, 88, keys, whilst, the, upper, keyboard, has, 76, keys, when, the, upper, keyboard, is, played, an, internal, mechanism, pulls, down, the, corresponding, key, on, the, lower, keyboard, but, an, octave, higher, this, lets, a, pianist, reach, two, octaves, with, one, hand, impossible, on, a, conventional, piano, due, to, its, double, keyboard, musical, works, that, were, originally, created, for, double, manual, harpsichord, such, as, the, goldberg, variations, by, bach, become, much, easier, to, play, since, playing, on, a, conventional, single, keyboard, piano, involves, complex, and, hand, tangling, cross, hand, movements, the, design, also, features, a, special, fourth, pedal, that, couples, the, lower, and, upper, keyboard, so, when, playing, on, the, lower, keyboard, the, note, one, octave, higher, also, plays, only, about, 60, em, nuel, mo, r, pianofortes, were, made, mostly, by, b, sendorfer, other, piano, manufacturers, such, as, bechstein, chickering, and, steinway, sons, also, manufactured, a, few, pianos, have, been, built, with, alternative, keyboard, systems, e, g, the, jank, keyboard, pianos, have, had, pedals, or, some, close, equivalent, since, the, earliest, days, in, the, 18th, century, some, pianos, used, levers, pressed, upward, by, the, player, s, knee, instead, of, pedals, most, grand, pianos, in, the, us, have, three, pedals, the, soft, pedal, una, corda, sostenuto, and, sustain, pedal, from, left, to, right, respectively, while, in, europe, the, standard, is, two, pedals, the, soft, pedal, and, the, sustain, pedal, most, modern, upright, pianos, also, have, three, pedals, soft, pedal, practice, pedal, and, sustain, pedal, though, older, or, cheaper, models, may, lack, the, practice, pedal, in, europe, the, standard, for, upright, pianos, is, two, pedals, the, soft, and, the, sustain, pedals, the, sustain, pedal, or, damper, pedal, is, often, simply, called, the, pedal, since, it, is, the, most, frequently, used, it, is, the, rightmost, pedal, in, the, group, it, lifts, the, dampers, from, all, strings, sustaining, played, notes, in, addition, it, broadens, the, overall, tone, by, allowing, all, strings, including, those, not, directly, played, to, reverberate, sympathetically, sympathetic, vibration, of, strings, is, strongest, among, notes, that, are, harmonically, related, to, the, sounded, pitches, i, e, a, played, 440, hz, a, note, would, evoke, the, higher, octave, a, notes, but, since, piano, strings, vibrate, with, a, great, complexity, of, overtones, the, harmonic, and, inharmonic, interaction, is, among, all, notes, is, enormous, the, soft, pedal, or, una, corda, pedal, is, placed, leftmost, in, the, row, of, pedals, in, grand, pianos, it, shifts, the, entire, action, keyboard, assembly, to, the, right, a, very, few, instruments, have, shifted, left, so, that, the, hammers, hit, two, of, the, three, strings, for, each, note, in, the, earliest, pianos, whose, unisons, were, bichords, rather, than, trichords, the, action, shifted, so, that, hammers, hit, a, single, string, hence, the, name, una, corda, or, one, string, the, effect, is, to, soften, the, note, as, well, as, change, the, tone, in, uprights, this, action, is, not, possible, instead, the, pedal, moves, the, hammers, closer, to, the, strings, allowing, the, hammers, to, strike, with, less, kinetic, energy, this, produces, a, slightly, softer, sound, but, no, change, in, timbre, on, grand, pianos, the, middle, pedal, is, a, sostenuto, pedal, this, pedal, keeps, raised, any, damper, already, raised, at, the, moment, the, pedal, is, depressed, this, makes, it, possible, to, sustain, selected, notes, by, depressing, the, sostenuto, pedal, before, those, notes, are, released, while, the, player, s, hands, are, free, to, play, additional, notes, which, don, t, sustain, this, can, be, useful, for, musical, passages, with, low, bass, pedal, points, in, which, a, bass, note, is, sustained, while, a, series, of, chords, changes, over, top, of, it, and, other, otherwise, tricky, parts, on, many, upright, pianos, the, middle, pedal, is, called, the, practice, or, celeste, pedal, this, drops, a, piece, of, felt, between, the, hammers, and, strings, greatly, muting, the, sounds, this, pedal, can, be, shifted, while, depressed, into, a, locking, position, there, are, also, non, standard, variants, on, some, pianos, grands, and, verticals, the, middle, pedal, can, be, a, bass, sustain, pedal, that, is, when, it, is, depressed, the, dampers, lift, off, the, strings, only, in, the, bass, section, players, use, this, pedal, to, sustain, a, single, bass, note, or, chord, over, many, measures, while, playing, the, melody, in, the, treble, section, the, rare, transposing, piano, an, example, of, which, was, owned, by, irving, berlin, has, a, middle, pedal, that, functions, as, a, clutch, that, disengages, the, keyboard, from, the, mechanism, so, the, player, can, move, the, keyboard, to, the, left, or, right, with, a, lever, this, shifts, the, entire, piano, action, so, the, pianist, can, play, music, written, in, one, key, so, that, it, sounds, in, a, different, key, some, piano, companies, have, included, extra, pedals, other, than, the, standard, two, or, three, on, the, stuart, and, sons, pianos, as, well, as, the, largest, fazioli, piano, there, is, a, fourth, pedal, to, the, left, of, the, principal, three, this, fourth, pedal, works, in, the, same, way, as, the, soft, pedal, of, an, upright, piano, moving, the, hammers, closer, to, the, strings, the, crown, and, schubert, piano, company, also, produced, a, four, pedal, piano, wing, and, son, of, new, york, offered, a, five, pedal, piano, from, approximately, 1893, through, the, 1920s, there, is, no, mention, of, the, company, past, the, 1930s, labeled, left, to, right, the, pedals, are, mandolin, orchestra, expression, soft, and, forte, sustain, the, orchestral, pedal, produced, a, sound, similar, to, a, tremolo, feel, by, bouncing, a, set, of, small, beads, dangling, against, the, strings, enabling, the, piano, to, mimic, a, mandolin, guitar, banjo, zither, and, harp, thus, the, name, orchestral, the, mandolin, pedal, used, a, similar, approach, lowering, a, set, of, felt, strips, with, metal, rings, in, between, the, hammers, and, the, strings, aka, rinky, tink, effect, this, extended, the, life, of, the, hammers, when, the, orch, pedal, was, used, a, good, idea, for, practicing, and, created, an, echo, like, sound, that, mimicked, playing, in, an, orchestral, hall, the, pedalier, piano, or, pedal, piano, is, a, rare, type, of, piano, that, includes, a, pedalboard, so, players, can, use, their, feet, to, play, bass, register, notes, as, on, an, organ, there, are, two, types, of, pedal, piano, on, one, the, pedal, board, is, an, integral, part, of, the, instrument, using, the, same, strings, and, mechanism, as, the, manual, keyboard, the, other, rarer, type, consists, of, two, independent, pianos, each, with, separate, mechanics, and, strings, placed, one, above, the, other, one, for, the, hands, and, one, for, the, feet, this, was, developed, primarily, as, a, practice, instrument, for, organists, though, there, is, a, small, repertoire, written, specifically, for, the, instrument, when, the, key, is, struck, a, chain, reaction, occurs, to, produce, the, sound, first, the, key, raises, the, wippen, mechanism, which, forces, the, jack, against, the, hammer, roller, or, knuckle, the, hammer, roller, then, lifts, the, lever, carrying, the, hammer, the, key, also, raises, the, damper, and, immediately, after, the, hammer, strikes, the, wire, it, falls, back, allowing, the, wire, to, resonate, and, thus, produce, sound, when, the, key, is, released, the, damper, falls, back, onto, the, strings, stopping, the, wire, from, vibrating, and, thus, stopping, the, sound, the, vibrating, piano, strings, themselves, are, not, very, loud, but, their, vibrations, are, transmitted, to, a, large, soundboard, that, moves, air, and, thus, converts, the, energy, to, sound, the, irregular, shape, and, off, center, placement, of, the, bridge, ensure, that, the, soundboard, vibrates, strongly, at, all, frequencies, the, raised, damper, allows, the, note, to, sound, until, the, key, or, sustain, pedal, is, released, there, are, three, factors, that, influence, the, pitch, of, a, vibrating, wire, a, vibrating, wire, subdivides, itself, into, many, parts, vibrating, at, the, same, time, each, part, produces, a, pitch, of, its, own, called, a, partial, a, vibrating, string, has, one, fundamental, and, a, series, of, partials, the, purest, combination, of, two, pitches, is, when, one, is, double, the, frequency, of, the, other, for, a, repeating, wave, the, velocity, v, equals, the, wavelength, times, the, frequency, f, on, the, piano, string, waves, reflect, from, both, ends, the, superposition, of, reflecting, waves, results, in, a, standing, wave, pattern, but, only, for, wavelengths, 2, l, l, 2, l, 3, l, 2, 2, l, n, where, l, is, the, length, of, the, string, therefore, the, only, frequencies, produced, on, a, single, string, are, f, nv, 2, l, timbre, is, largely, determined, by, the, content, of, these, harmonics, different, instruments, have, different, harmonic, content, for, the, same, pitch, a, real, string, vibrates, at, harmonics, that, are, not, perfect, multiples, of, the, fundamental, this, results, in, a, little, inharmonicity, which, gives, richness, to, the, tone, but, causes, significant, tuning, challenges, throughout, the, compass, of, the, instrument, striking, the, piano, key, with, greater, velocity, increases, the, amplitude, of, the, waves, and, therefore, the, volume, from, pianissimo, pp, to, fortissimo, ff, the, hammer, velocity, changes, by, almost, a, factor, of, a, hundred, the, hammer, contact, time, with, the, string, shortens, from, 4, milliseconds, at, pp, to, less, than, 2, ms, at, ff, if, two, wires, adjusted, to, the, same, pitch, are, struck, at, the, same, time, the, sound, produced, by, one, reinforces, the, other, and, a, louder, combined, sound, of, shorter, duration, is, produced, if, one, wire, vibrates, out, of, synchronization, with, the, other, they, subtract, from, each, other, and, produce, a, softer, tone, of, longer, duration, pianos, are, heavy, and, powerful, yet, delicate, instruments, over, the, years, professional, piano, movers, have, developed, special, techniques, for, transporting, both, grands, and, uprights, which, prevent, damage, to, the, case, and, to, the, piano, s, mechanical, elements, pianos, need, regular, tuning, to, keep, them, on, correct, pitch, the, hammers, of, pianos, are, voiced, to, compensate, for, gradual, hardening, of, the, felt, and, other, parts, also, need, periodic, regulation, pianos, need, regular, maintenance, to, ensure, the, felt, hammers, and, key, mechanisms, are, functioning, properly, aged, and, worn, pianos, can, be, rebuilt, or, reconditioned, by, piano, rebuilders, strings, eventually, must, be, replaced, often, by, replacing, a, great, number, of, their, parts, and, adjusting, them, old, instruments, can, perform, as, well, as, new, pianos, piano, tuning, involves, adjusting, the, tensions, of, the, piano, s, strings, with, a, specialized, wrench, thereby, aligning, the, intervals, among, their, tones, so, that, the, instrument, is, in, tune, while, guitar, and, violin, players, tune, their, own, instruments, pianists, usually, hire, a, piano, tuner, a, specialized, technician, to, tune, their, pianos, the, piano, tuner, uses, special, tools, the, meaning, of, the, term, in, tune, in, the, context, of, piano, tuning, is, not, simply, a, particular, fixed, set, of, pitches, fine, piano, tuning, carefully, assesses, the, interaction, among, all, notes, of, the, chromatic, scale, different, for, every, piano, and, thus, requires, slightly, different, pitches, from, any, theoretical, standard, pianos, are, usually, tuned, to, a, modified, version, of, the, system, called, equal, temperament, see, piano, key, frequencies, for, the, theoretical, piano, tuning, in, all, systems, of, tuning, each, pitch, is, derived, from, its, relationship, to, a, chosen, fixed, pitch, usually, the, internationally, recognized, standard, concert, pitch, of, a, 4, the, a, above, middle, c, the, term, a440, refers, to, a, widely, accepted, frequency, of, this, pitch, 440, hz, the, relationship, between, two, pitches, called, an, interval, is, the, ratio, of, their, absolute, frequencies, two, different, intervals, are, perceived, as, the, same, when, the, pairs, of, pitches, involved, share, the, same, frequency, ratio, the, easiest, intervals, to, identify, and, the, easiest, intervals, to, tune, are, those, that, are, just, meaning, they, have, a, simple, whole, number, ratio, the, term, temperament, refers, to, a, tuning, system, that, tempers, the, just, intervals, usually, the, perfect, fifth, which, has, the, ratio, 3, 2, to, satisfy, another, mathematical, property, in, equal, temperament, a, fifth, is, tempered, by, narrowing, it, slightly, achieved, by, flattening, its, upper, pitch, slightly, or, raising, its, lower, pitch, slightly, a, temperament, system, is, also, known, as, a, set, of, bearings, tempering, an, interval, causes, it, to, beat, which, is, a, fluctuation, in, perceived, sound, intensity, due, to, interference, between, close, but, unequal, pitches, the, rate, of, beating, is, equal, to, the, frequency, differences, of, any, harmonics, that, are, present, for, both, pitches, and, that, coincide, or, nearly, coincide, piano, tuners, have, to, use, their, ear, to, stretch, the, tuning, of, a, piano, to, make, it, sound, in, tune, this, involves, tuning, the, highest, pitched, strings, slightly, higher, and, the, lowest, pitched, strings, slightly, lower, than, what, a, mathematical, frequency, table, in, which, octaves, are, derived, by, doubling, the, frequency, would, suggest, as, with, any, other, musical, instrument, the, piano, may, be, played, from, written, music, by, ear, or, through, improvisation, while, some, folk, and, blues, pianists, were, self, taught, in, classical, and, jazz, there, are, well, established, piano, teaching, systems, and, institutions, including, pre, college, graded, examinations, university, college, and, music, conservatory, diplomas, and, degrees, ranging, from, the, b, mus, and, m, mus, to, the, doctor, of, musical, arts, in, piano, piano, technique, evolved, during, the, transition, from, harpsichord, and, clavichord, to, fortepiano, playing, and, continued, through, the, development, of, the, modern, piano, changes, in, musical, styles, and, audience, preferences, over, the, 19th, and, 20th, century, as, well, as, the, emergence, of, virtuoso, performers, contributed, to, this, evolution, and, to, the, growth, of, distinct, approaches, or, schools, of, piano, playing, although, technique, is, often, viewed, as, only, the, physical, execution, of, a, musical, idea, many, pedagogues, and, performers, stress, the, interrelatedness, of, the, physical, and, mental, or, emotional, aspects, of, piano, playing, well, known, approaches, to, piano, technique, include, those, by, dorothy, taubman, edna, golandsky, fred, karpoff, charles, louis, hanon, and, otto, ortmann, many, classical, music, composers, including, haydn, mozart, schubert, and, beethoven, composed, for, the, fortepiano, a, rather, different, instrument, than, the, modern, piano, even, composers, of, the, romantic, movement, like, franz, liszt, fr, d, ric, chopin, clara, and, robert, schumann, fanny, and, felix, mendelssohn, and, johannes, brahms, wrote, for, pianos, substantially, different, from, 2010, era, modern, pianos, contemporary, musicians, may, adjust, their, interpretation, of, historical, compositions, from, the, 1600s, to, the, 1800s, to, account, for, sound, quality, differences, between, old, and, new, instruments, or, to, changing, performance, practice, starting, in, beethoven, s, later, career, the, fortepiano, evolved, into, an, instrument, more, like, the, modern, piano, of, the, 2000s, modern, pianos, were, in, wide, use, by, the, late, 19th, century, they, featured, an, octave, range, larger, than, the, earlier, fortepiano, instrument, adding, around, 30, more, keys, to, the, instrument, which, extended, the, deep, bass, range, and, the, high, treble, range, factory, mass, production, of, upright, pianos, made, them, more, affordable, for, a, larger, number, of, middle, class, people, they, appeared, in, music, halls, and, pubs, during, the, 19th, century, providing, entertainment, through, a, piano, soloist, or, in, combination, with, a, small, dance, band, just, as, harpsichordists, had, accompanied, singers, or, dancers, performing, on, stage, or, playing, for, dances, pianists, took, up, this, role, in, the, late, 1700s, and, in, the, following, centuries, during, the, 19th, century, american, musicians, playing, for, working, class, audiences, in, small, pubs, and, bars, particularly, african, american, composers, developed, new, musical, genres, based, on, the, modern, piano, ragtime, music, popularized, by, composers, such, as, scott, joplin, reached, a, broader, audience, by, 1900, the, popularity, of, ragtime, music, was, quickly, succeeded, by, jazz, piano, new, techniques, and, rhythms, were, invented, for, the, piano, including, ostinato, for, boogie, woogie, and, shearing, voicing, george, gershwin, s, rhapsody, in, blue, broke, new, musical, ground, by, combining, american, jazz, piano, with, symphonic, sounds, comping, a, technique, for, accompanying, jazz, vocalists, on, piano, was, exemplified, by, duke, ellington, s, technique, honky, tonk, music, featuring, yet, another, style, of, piano, rhythm, became, popular, during, the, same, era, bebop, techniques, grew, out, of, jazz, with, leading, composer, pianists, such, as, thelonious, monk, and, bud, powell, in, the, late, 20th, century, bill, evans, composed, pieces, combining, classical, techniques, with, his, jazz, experimentation, in, the, 1970s, herbie, hancock, was, one, of, the, first, jazz, composer, pianists, to, find, mainstream, popularity, working, with, newer, urban, music, techniques, such, as, jazz, funk, and, jazz, rock, pianos, have, also, been, used, prominently, in, rock, and, roll, and, rock, music, by, performers, such, as, jerry, lee, lewis, little, richard, keith, emerson, emerson, lake, palmer, elton, john, ben, folds, billy, joel, nicky, hopkins, rick, wakeman, freddie, mercury, and, tori, amos, to, name, a, few, at, a, 2023, auction, in, sotheby, s, in, london, mercury, s, yamaha, baby, grand, piano, which, he, used, to, compose, bohemian, rhapsody, among, other, queen, songs, sold, for, 1, 7, million, 2, 1, million, which, sotheby, s, state, is, a, record, for, a, composer, s, piano, modernist, styles, of, music, have, also, appealed, to, composers, writing, for, the, modern, grand, piano, including, john, cage, and, philip, glass, introduced, to, burma, during, the, mid, 19th, century, the, piano, was, quickly, indigenized, by, court, musicians, and, uses, a, novel, technique, of, interlocked, fingering, with, both, hands, extending, a, single, melodic, line, allowed, for, agogic, embellishment, fleeting, grace, notes, in, syncopated, spirals, around, a, steady, underlying, beat, found, in, the, bell, and, clapper, time, keepers, adapted, to, play, mah, g, ta, compositions, many, burmese, pianists, e, g, sandayar, hla, htut, and, sandayar, chit, swe, adopt, a, title, from, the, word, for, piano, sandaya, burmese, the, piano, is, a, crucial, instrument, in, western, classical, music, jazz, blues, rock, folk, music, and, many, other, western, musical, genres, pianos, are, used, in, soloing, or, melodic, roles, and, as, accompaniment, instruments, as, well, pianos, can, be, played, alone, with, a, voice, or, other, instrument, in, small, groups, bands, and, chamber, music, ensembles, and, large, ensembles, big, band, or, orchestra, a, large, number, of, composers, and, songwriters, are, proficient, pianists, because, the, piano, keyboard, offers, an, effective, means, of, experimenting, with, complex, melodic, and, harmonic, interplay, of, chords, and, trying, out, multiple, independent, melody, lines, that, are, played, at, the, same, time, pianos, are, used, by, composers, doing, film, and, television, scoring, as, the, large, range, permits, composers, to,
