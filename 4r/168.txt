utopia, latin, libellus, vere, aureus, nec, minus, salutaris, quam, festivus, de, optimo, rei, publicae, statu, deque, nova, insula, utopia, a, truly, golden, little, book, not, less, beneficial, than, enjoyable, about, how, things, should, be, in, a, state, and, about, the, new, island, utopia, is, a, work, of, fiction, and, socio, political, satire, by, thomas, more, 1478, 1535, written, in, latin, and, published, in, 1516, the, book, is, a, frame, narrative, primarily, depicting, a, fictional, island, society, and, its, religious, social, and, political, customs, many, aspects, of, more, s, description, of, utopia, are, reminiscent, of, life, in, monasteries, the, title, de, optimo, rei, publicae, statu, deque, nova, insula, utopia, literally, translates, of, a, republic, s, best, state, and, of, the, new, island, utopia, it, is, variously, rendered, as, any, of, the, following, the, first, created, original, name, was, even, longer, libellus, vere, aureus, nec, minus, salutaris, quam, festivus, de, optimo, rei, publicae, statu, deque, nova, insula, utopia, that, translates, a, truly, golden, little, book, no, less, beneficial, than, entertaining, of, a, republic, s, best, state, and, of, the, new, island, utopia, utopia, is, derived, from, the, greek, prefix, ou, meaning, not, and, topos, place, with, the, suffix, i, that, is, typical, of, toponyms, the, name, literally, means, nowhere, emphasizing, its, fictionality, in, early, modern, english, utopia, was, spelled, utopie, which, is, today, rendered, utopy, in, some, editions, in, fact, more, s, very, first, name, for, the, island, was, nusquama, the, latin, equivalent, of, no, place, but, he, eventually, opted, for, the, greek, influenced, name, in, english, utopia, is, pronounced, the, same, as, eutopia, the, latter, word, in, greek, meaning, good, place, contains, the, prefix, good, with, which, the, of, utopia, has, come, to, be, confused, in, the, english, pronunciation, that, is, something, that, more, himself, addresses, in, an, addendum, to, his, book, wherfore, not, utopie, but, rather, rightely, my, name, is, eutopie, a, place, of, felicitie, the, first, edition, contained, a, woodcut, map, of, the, island, of, utopia, the, utopian, alphabet, verses, by, pieter, gillis, gerard, geldenhouwer, and, cornelius, grapheus, and, thomas, more, s, epistle, dedicating, the, work, to, gillis, the, work, begins, with, written, correspondence, between, thomas, more, and, several, people, he, had, met, in, europe, peter, gilles, town, clerk, of, antwerp, and, hieronymus, van, busleyden, counselor, to, charles, v, more, chose, those, letters, which, are, communications, between, actual, people, to, further, the, plausibility, of, his, fictional, land, in, the, same, spirit, the, letters, also, include, a, specimen, of, the, utopian, alphabet, and, its, poetry, the, letters, also, explain, the, lack, of, widespread, travel, to, utopia, during, the, first, mention, of, the, land, someone, had, coughed, during, announcement, of, the, exact, longitude, and, latitude, the, first, book, tells, of, the, traveller, raphael, hythlodaeus, to, whom, more, is, introduced, in, antwerp, and, it, also, explores, the, subject, of, how, best, to, counsel, a, prince, a, popular, topic, at, the, time, the, first, discussions, with, raphael, allow, him, to, discuss, some, of, the, modern, ills, affecting, europe, such, as, the, tendency, of, kings, to, start, wars, and, the, subsequent, loss, of, money, on, fruitless, endeavours, he, also, criticises, the, use, of, execution, to, punish, theft, by, saying, that, thieves, might, as, well, murder, whom, they, rob, to, remove, witnesses, if, the, punishment, is, going, to, be, the, same, the, abstract, principle, being, never, to, make, it, safer, to, follow, out, an, evil, plan, than, to, repent, of, it, he, lays, most, of, the, problems, of, theft, on, the, practice, of, enclosure, the, enclosing, of, common, land, and, the, subsequent, poverty, and, starvation, of, people, who, are, denied, access, to, land, because, of, sheep, farming, more, tries, to, convince, raphael, that, he, could, find, a, good, job, in, a, royal, court, to, advise, monarchs, but, raphael, says, that, his, views, are, too, radical, and, would, not, be, listened, to, raphael, sees, himself, in, the, tradition, of, plato, he, knows, that, for, good, governance, kings, must, act, philosophically, he, however, points, out, plato, doubtless, did, well, foresee, unless, kings, themselves, would, apply, their, minds, to, the, study, of, philosophy, that, else, they, would, never, thoroughly, allow, the, council, of, philosophers, being, themselves, before, even, from, their, tender, age, infected, and, corrupt, with, perverse, and, evil, opinions, more, seems, to, contemplate, the, duty, of, philosophers, to, work, around, and, in, real, situations, and, for, the, sake, of, political, expediency, work, within, flawed, systems, to, make, them, better, rather, than, hoping, to, start, again, from, first, principles, for, in, courts, they, will, not, bear, with, a, man, s, holding, his, peace, or, conniving, at, what, others, do, a, man, must, barefacedly, approve, of, the, worst, counsels, and, consent, to, the, blackest, designs, so, that, he, would, pass, for, a, spy, or, possibly, for, a, traitor, that, did, but, coldly, approve, of, such, wicked, practices, utopia, is, placed, in, the, new, world, and, more, links, raphael, s, travels, in, with, amerigo, vespucci, s, real, life, voyages, of, discovery, he, suggests, that, raphael, is, one, of, the, 24, men, vespucci, in, his, four, voyages, of, 1507, says, he, left, for, six, months, at, cabo, frio, brazil, raphael, then, travels, further, and, finds, the, island, of, utopia, where, he, spends, five, years, observing, the, customs, of, the, natives, according, to, more, the, island, of, utopia, is, two, hundred, miles, across, in, the, middle, part, where, it, is, widest, and, nowhere, much, narrower, than, this, except, towards, the, two, ends, where, it, gradually, tapers, these, ends, curved, round, as, if, completing, a, circle, five, hundred, miles, in, circumference, make, the, island, crescent, shaped, like, a, new, moon, the, island, was, originally, a, peninsula, but, a, 15, mile, wide, channel, was, dug, by, the, community, s, founder, king, utopos, to, separate, it, from, the, mainland, the, island, contains, 54, cities, each, city, is, divided, into, four, equal, parts, the, capital, city, amaurot, is, located, directly, in, the, middle, of, the, crescent, island, each, city, has, not, more, than, 6000, households, each, family, consisting, of, between, 10, and, 16, adults, thirty, households, are, grouped, together, and, elect, a, syphograntus, whom, more, says, is, now, called, a, phylarchus, every, ten, syphogranti, have, an, elected, traniborus, more, recently, called, a, protophylarchus, ruling, over, them, the, 200, syphogranti, of, a, city, elect, a, prince, in, a, secret, ballot, the, prince, stays, for, life, unless, he, is, deposed, or, removed, for, suspicion, of, tyranny, people, are, redistributed, around, the, households, and, towns, to, keep, numbers, even, if, the, island, suffers, from, overpopulation, colonies, are, set, up, on, the, mainland, alternatively, the, natives, of, the, mainland, are, invited, to, be, part, of, the, utopian, colonies, but, if, they, dislike, them, and, no, longer, wish, to, stay, they, may, return, in, the, case, of, underpopulation, the, colonists, are, recalled, there, is, no, private, property, on, utopia, with, goods, being, stored, in, warehouses, and, people, requesting, what, they, need, there, are, also, no, locks, on, the, doors, of, the, houses, and, the, houses, are, rotated, between, the, citizens, every, ten, years, agriculture, provides, the, most, important, occupation, on, the, island, every, person, is, taught, it, and, must, live, in, the, countryside, farming, for, two, years, at, a, time, with, women, doing, the, same, work, as, men, similarly, every, citizen, must, learn, at, least, one, of, the, other, essential, trades, weaving, mainly, done, by, the, women, carpentry, metalsmithing, and, masonry, there, is, deliberate, simplicity, about, the, trades, for, instance, all, people, wear, the, same, types, of, simple, clothes, and, there, are, no, dressmakers, making, fine, apparel, all, able, bodied, citizens, must, work, thus, unemployment, is, eradicated, and, the, length, of, the, working, day, can, be, minimized, the, people, have, to, work, only, six, hours, a, day, although, many, willingly, work, for, longer, more, does, allow, scholars, in, his, society, to, become, the, ruling, officials, or, priests, people, picked, during, their, primary, education, for, their, ability, to, learn, all, other, citizens, however, are, encouraged, to, apply, themselves, to, learning, in, their, leisure, time, slavery, is, a, feature, of, utopian, life, and, it, is, reported, that, every, household, has, two, slaves, the, slaves, are, either, from, other, countries, prisoners, of, war, people, condemned, to, die, or, poor, people, or, are, the, utopian, criminals, the, criminals, are, weighed, down, with, chains, made, out, of, gold, the, gold, is, part, of, the, community, wealth, of, the, country, and, fettering, criminals, with, it, or, using, it, for, shameful, things, like, chamber, pots, gives, the, citizens, a, healthy, dislike, of, it, it, also, makes, it, difficult, to, steal, as, it, is, in, plain, view, the, wealth, though, is, of, little, importance, and, is, good, only, for, buying, commodities, from, foreign, nations, or, bribing, the, nations, to, fight, each, other, slaves, are, periodically, released, for, good, behaviour, jewels, are, worn, by, children, who, finally, give, them, up, as, they, mature, other, significant, innovations, of, utopia, include, a, welfare, state, with, free, hospitals, euthanasia, permissible, by, the, state, priests, being, allowed, to, marry, divorce, permitted, premarital, sex, punished, by, a, lifetime, of, enforced, celibacy, and, adultery, being, punished, by, enslavement, meals, are, taken, in, community, dining, halls, and, the, job, of, feeding, the, population, is, given, to, a, different, household, in, turn, although, all, are, fed, the, same, raphael, explains, that, the, old, and, the, administrators, are, given, the, best, of, the, food, travel, on, the, island, is, permitted, only, with, an, internal, passport, and, any, people, found, without, a, passport, are, on, a, first, occasion, returned, in, disgrace, but, after, a, second, offence, they, are, placed, in, slavery, in, addition, there, are, no, lawyers, and, the, law, is, made, deliberately, simple, as, all, should, understand, it, and, not, leave, people, in, any, doubt, of, what, is, right, and, wrong, there, are, several, religions, on, the, island, moon, worshippers, sun, worshippers, planet, worshippers, ancestor, worshippers, and, monotheists, but, each, is, tolerant, of, the, others, only, atheists, are, despised, but, allowed, in, utopia, as, they, are, seen, as, representing, a, danger, to, the, state, since, they, do, not, believe, in, any, punishment, or, reward, after, this, life, they, have, no, reason, to, share, the, communistic, life, of, utopia, and, so, will, break, the, laws, for, their, own, gain, they, are, not, banished, but, are, encouraged, to, talk, out, their, erroneous, beliefs, with, the, priests, until, they, are, convinced, of, their, error, raphael, says, that, through, his, teachings, christianity, was, beginning, to, take, hold, in, utopia, the, toleration, of, all, other, religious, ideas, is, enshrined, in, a, universal, prayer, all, the, utopians, recite, but, if, they, are, mistaken, and, if, there, is, either, a, better, government, or, a, religion, more, acceptable, to, god, they, implore, his, goodness, to, let, them, know, it, wives, are, subject, to, their, husbands, and, husbands, are, subject, to, their, wives, although, women, are, restricted, to, conducting, household, tasks, for, the, most, part, only, few, widowed, women, become, priests, while, all, are, trained, in, military, arts, women, confess, their, sins, to, their, husbands, once, a, month, gambling, hunting, makeup, and, astrology, are, all, discouraged, in, utopia, the, role, allocated, to, women, in, utopia, might, however, have, been, seen, as, being, more, liberal, from, a, contemporary, point, of, view, utopians, do, not, like, to, engage, in, war, if, they, feel, countries, friendly, to, them, have, been, wronged, they, will, send, military, aid, but, they, try, to, capture, rather, than, kill, enemies, they, are, upset, if, they, achieve, victory, through, bloodshed, the, main, purpose, of, war, is, to, achieve, what, over, which, if, they, had, achieved, already, they, would, not, have, gone, to, war, privacy, is, not, regarded, as, freedom, in, utopia, taverns, ale, houses, and, places, for, private, gatherings, are, nonexistent, for, the, effect, of, keeping, all, men, in, full, view, and, so, they, are, obliged, to, behave, well, the, story, is, written, from, the, perspective, of, more, himself, that, was, common, at, the, time, and, more, uses, his, own, name, and, background, to, create, the, narrator, the, book, is, written, in, two, parts, book, one, dialogue, of, council, and, book, two, discourse, on, utopia, the, first, book, is, told, from, the, perspective, of, more, the, narrator, who, is, introduced, by, his, friend, peter, giles, to, a, fellow, traveller, named, raphael, hythloday, whose, name, translates, as, expert, of, nonsense, in, greek, in, an, amicable, dialogue, with, more, and, giles, hythloday, expresses, strong, criticism, of, then, modern, practices, in, england, and, other, catholicism, dominated, countries, such, as, the, crime, of, theft, being, punishable, by, death, and, the, over, willingness, of, kings, to, start, wars, getty, 321, book, two, has, hythloday, tell, his, interlocutors, about, utopia, where, he, has, lived, for, five, years, with, the, aim, of, convincing, them, about, its, superior, state, of, affairs, utopia, turns, out, to, share, many, of, the, features, of, what, would, come, to, be, called, a, socialist, state, interpretations, about, this, important, part, of, the, book, vary, gilbert, notes, that, while, some, experts, believe, that, more, supports, socialism, others, believe, that, he, demonstrates, a, belief, that, socialism, is, impractical, the, former, would, argue, that, more, used, book, two, to, show, how, socialism, would, work, in, practice, individual, cities, are, run, by, privately, elected, princes, and, families, are, made, up, of, ten, to, sixteen, adults, living, in, a, single, household, it, is, unknown, if, more, truly, believed, in, socialism, or, if, he, printed, utopia, to, argue, that, true, socialism, was, impractical, gilbert, more, printed, many, writings, involving, socialism, some, seemingly, in, defense, of, it, and, others, apparently, scathing, satires, against, it, some, scholars, believe, that, more, uses, the, structure, to, show, the, perspective, of, something, as, an, idea, against, something, put, into, practice, hythloday, describes, the, city, as, perfect, and, ideal, and, believes, the, society, thrives, and, is, perfect, as, such, he, is, used, to, represent, the, more, fanatic, socialists, and, radical, reformists, of, his, day, when, more, arrives, he, describes, the, social, and, cultural, norms, put, into, practice, citing, a, city, thriving, and, idealistic, while, some, believe, that, is, more, s, ideal, society, some, believe, the, book, s, title, which, translates, to, nowhere, from, greek, is, a, way, to, describe, that, the, practices, used, in, utopia, are, impractical, and, could, not, be, used, in, a, modern, world, successfully, gilbert, either, way, utopia, has, become, one, of, the, most, talked, about, works, both, in, defense, of, socialism, and, against, it, one, of, the, most, troublesome, questions, about, utopia, is, thomas, more, s, reason, for, writing, it, most, scholars, see, it, as, a, comment, on, or, criticism, of, 16th, century, catholicism, since, the, evils, of, more, s, day, are, laid, out, in, book, i, and, in, many, ways, apparently, solved, in, book, ii, indeed, utopia, has, many, of, the, characteristics, of, satire, and, there, are, many, jokes, and, satirical, asides, such, as, how, honest, people, are, in, europe, but, these, are, usually, contrasted, with, the, simple, uncomplicated, society, of, the, utopians, yet, the, puzzle, is, that, some, of, the, practices, and, institutions, of, the, utopians, such, as, the, ease, of, divorce, euthanasia, and, both, married, priests, and, female, priests, seem, to, be, polar, opposites, of, more, s, beliefs, and, the, teachings, of, the, catholic, church, of, which, he, was, a, devout, member, another, often, cited, apparent, contradiction, is, that, of, the, religious, tolerance, of, utopia, contrasted, with, his, persecution, of, protestants, as, lord, chancellor, similarly, the, criticism, of, lawyers, comes, from, a, writer, who, as, lord, chancellor, was, arguably, the, most, influential, lawyer, in, england, it, can, be, answered, however, that, as, a, pagan, society, utopians, had, the, best, ethics, that, could, be, reached, through, reason, alone, or, that, more, changed, from, his, early, life, to, his, later, when, he, was, lord, chancellor, one, highly, influential, interpretation, of, utopia, is, that, of, the, intellectual, historian, quentin, skinner, he, has, argued, that, more, was, taking, part, in, the, renaissance, humanist, debate, over, true, nobility, and, that, he, was, writing, to, prove, the, perfect, commonwealth, could, not, occur, with, private, property, crucially, skinner, sees, raphael, hythlodaeus, as, embodying, the, platonic, view, that, philosophers, should, not, get, involved, in, politics, but, the, character, of, more, embodies, the, more, pragmatic, ciceronian, view, thus, the, society, raphael, proposes, is, the, ideal, that, more, would, want, however, without, communism, which, he, saw, no, possibility, of, occurring, it, was, wiser, to, take, a, more, pragmatic, view, quentin, skinner, s, interpretation, of, utopia, is, consistent, with, the, speculation, that, stephen, greenblatt, made, in, the, swerve, how, the, world, became, modern, there, greenblatt, argued, that, more, was, under, the, epicurean, influence, of, lucretius, s, on, the, nature, of, things, and, the, people, that, live, in, utopia, were, an, example, of, how, pleasure, has, become, their, guiding, principle, of, life, although, greenblatt, acknowledged, that, more, s, insistence, on, the, existence, of, an, afterlife, and, punishment, for, people, holding, contrary, views, were, inconsistent, with, the, essentially, materialist, view, of, epicureanism, greenblatt, contended, that, it, was, the, minimum, conditions, for, what, the, pious, more, would, have, considered, as, necessary, to, live, a, happy, life, another, complication, comes, from, the, greek, meanings, of, the, names, of, people, and, places, in, the, work, apart, from, utopia, meaning, noplace, several, other, lands, are, mentioned, achora, meaning, nolandia, polyleritae, meaning, muchnonsense, macarenses, meaning, happiland, and, the, river, anydrus, meaning, nowater, raphael, s, last, name, hythlodaeus, means, dispenser, of, nonsense, surely, implying, that, the, whole, of, the, utopian, text, is, nonsense, additionally, the, latin, rendering, of, more, s, name, morus, is, similar, to, the, word, for, a, fool, in, greek, it, is, unclear, whether, more, is, simply, being, ironic, an, in, joke, for, those, who, know, greek, seeing, as, the, place, he, is, talking, about, does, not, actually, exist, or, whether, there, is, actually, a, sense, of, distancing, of, hythlodaeus, and, the, more, s, morus, views, in, the, text, from, his, own, the, name, raphael, though, may, have, been, chosen, by, more, to, remind, his, readers, of, the, archangel, raphael, who, is, mentioned, in, the, book, of, tobit, 3, 17, 5, 4, 16, 6, 11, 14, 16, 18, also, in, chs, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, in, that, book, the, angel, guides, tobias, and, later, cures, his, father, of, his, blindness, while, hythlodaeus, may, suggest, his, words, are, not, to, be, trusted, raphael, meaning, in, hebrew, god, has, healed, suggests, that, raphael, may, be, opening, the, eyes, of, the, reader, to, what, is, true, the, suggestion, that, more, may, have, agreed, with, the, views, of, raphael, is, given, weight, by, the, way, he, dressed, with, his, cloak, hanging, carelessly, about, him, a, style, that, roger, ascham, reports, that, more, himself, was, wont, to, adopt, furthermore, more, recent, criticism, has, questioned, the, reliability, of, both, gile, s, annotations, and, the, character, of, more, in, the, text, itself, claims, that, the, book, only, subverts, utopia, and, hythlodaeus, are, possibly, oversimplistic, classical, scholar, giulia, sissa, claims, that, hythlodaeus, is, an, impersonation, of, erasmus, in, humans, and, animals, in, thomas, more, s, utopia, christopher, burlinson, argues, that, more, intended, to, produce, a, fictional, space, in, which, ethical, concerns, of, humanity, and, bestial, inhumanity, could, be, explored, burlinson, regards, the, utopian, criticisms, of, finding, pleasure, in, the, spectacle, of, bloodshed, as, reflective, of, more, s, own, anxieties, about, the, fragility, of, humanity, and, the, ease, in, which, humans, fall, to, beast, like, ways, according, to, burlinson, more, interprets, that, decadent, expression, of, animal, cruelty, as, a, causal, antecedent, for, the, cruel, intercourse, present, within, the, world, of, utopia, and, more, s, own, burlinson, does, not, argue, that, more, explicitly, equates, animal, and, human, subjectivities, but, is, interested, in, more, s, treatment, of, human, animal, relations, as, significant, ethical, concerns, intertwined, with, religious, ideas, of, salvation, and, the, divine, qualities, of, souls, in, indian, givers, how, the, indians, of, the, americas, transformed, the, world, jack, weatherford, asserts, that, native, american, societies, played, an, inspirational, role, for, more, s, writing, for, example, indigenous, americans, although, referred, to, as, noble, savages, in, many, circles, showed, the, possibility, of, living, in, social, harmony, and, prosperity, without, the, rule, a, king, the, early, british, and, french, settlers, in, the, 1500, and, 1600s, were, relatively, shocked, to, see, how, the, native, americans, moved, around, so, freely, across, the, untamed, land, not, beholden, by, debt, lack, of, magistrates, forced, services, riches, poverty, or, inheritance, arthur, morgan, hypothesized, that, utopia, was, more, s, description, of, the, inca, empire, although, it, is, implausible, that, more, was, aware, of, them, when, he, wrote, the, book, in, utopian, justifications, more, s, utopia, settler, colonialism, and, contemporary, ecocritical, concerns, susan, bruce, juxtaposes, utopian, justifications, for, the, violent, dispossession, of, idle, peoples, unwilling, to, surrender, lands, that, are, underutilized, with, peter, kosminsky, s, the, promise, a, 2011, television, drama, centered, around, zionist, settler, colonialism, in, modern, day, palestine, bruce, s, treatment, of, utopian, foreign, policy, which, mirrored, european, concerns, in, more, s, day, situates, more, s, text, as, an, articulation, of, settler, colonialism, bruce, identifies, an, isomorphic, relationship, between, utopian, settler, logic, and, the, account, provided, by, the, promise, s, paul, who, recalls, his, father, s, criticism, of, palestinians, as, undeserving, indolent, and, animalistic, occupants, of, the, land, bruce, interprets, the, utopian, fixation, with, material, surplus, as, foundational, for, exploitative, gift, economies, which, ensnare, utopia, s, bordering, neighbors, into, a, subservient, relationship, of, dependence, in, which, they, remain, in, constant, fear, of, being, subsumed, by, the, superficially, generous, utopians, utopia, was, begun, while, more, was, an, envoy, in, the, low, countries, in, may, 1515, more, started, by, writing, the, introduction, and, the, description, of, the, society, that, would, become, the, second, half, of, the, work, and, on, his, return, to, england, he, wrote, the, dialogue, of, counsel, he, completed, the, work, in, 1516, in, the, same, year, it, was, printed, in, leuven, under, erasmus, s, editorship, and, after, revisions, by, more, it, was, printed, in, basel, in, november, 1518, it, was, not, until, 1551, sixteen, years, after, more, s, execution, that, it, was, first, published, in, england, as, an, english, translation, by, ralph, robinson, gilbert, burnet, s, translation, of, 1684, is, probably, the, most, commonly, cited, version, the, work, seems, to, have, been, popular, if, misunderstood, since, the, introduction, of, more, s, epigrams, of, 1518, mentions, a, man, who, did, not, regard, more, as, a,
