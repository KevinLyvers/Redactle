durrow, lindisfarne, gospels, and, the, book, of, kells, charlemagne, s, devotion, to, improved, scholarship, resulted, in, the, recruiting, of, a, crowd, of, scribes, according, to, alcuin, the, abbot, of, york, alcuin, developed, the, style, known, as, the, caroline, or, carolingian, minuscule, the, first, manuscript, in, this, hand, was, the, godescalc, evangelistary, finished, 783, a, gospel, book, written, by, the, scribe, godescalc, carolingian, remains, the, one, progenitor, hand, from, which, modern, booktype, descends, in, the, eleventh, century, the, caroline, evolved, into, the, blackletter, gothic, script, which, was, more, compact, and, made, it, possible, to, fit, more, text, on, a, page, 72, the, gothic, calligraphy, styles, became, dominant, throughout, europe, and, in, 1454, when, johannes, gutenberg, developed, the, first, printing, press, in, mainz, germany, he, adopted, the, gothic, style, making, it, the, first, typeface, 141, in, the, 15th, century, the,

three, hands, namely, the, coulee, the, rhonde, known, as, round, hand, in, english, and, a, speed, hand, sometimes, called, the, bastarda, while, there, were, many, great, french, masters, at, the, time, the, most, influential, in, proposing, these, hands, was, louis, barbedor, who, published, les, ecritures, financi, re, et, italienne, bastarde, dans, leur, naturel, c, 1650, with, the,

hand, while, snell, is, noted, for, his, reaction, to, them, and, warnings, of, restraint, and, proportionality, still, edward, crocker, began, publishing, his, copybooks, 40, years, before, the, aforementioned, other, european, styles, use, the, same, tools, and, practices, but, differ, by, character, set, and, stylistic, preferences, for, slavonic, lettering, the, history, of, the, slavonic, and, consequently, russian, writing, systems, differs, fundamentally, from, the, one, of, the, latin, language, it, evolved, from, the, 10th, century, to, today, unlike, a, typeface, handwritten, calligraphy, is, characterised, by, irregularity, in, the, characters, which, vary, in, size, shape, style, and, color, producing, a, distinct, aesthetic, value, although, it, may, also, make, the, content, illegible, to, readers, as, with, chinese, or, islamic, calligraphy, western, calligraphic, script, employed, the, use, of, strict, rules, and, shapes, quality, writing, had, a, rhythm, and, regularity, to, the, letters, with, a, geometrical, order, of, the, lines, on, the, page, each, character, had, and, often, still, has, a, precise, stroke, order, sacred, western, calligraphy, has, some, unique, features, such, as, the, illumination, of, the, first, letter, of, each, book, or, chapter, in, medieval, times, a, decorative, carpet, page, may, precede, the, literature, filled, with, ornate, geometrical, depictions, of, bold, hued, animals, the, lindisfarne, gospels, 715, 720, ce, are, an, early, example, many, of, the, themes, and, variations, of, today, s, contemporary, western, calligraphy, are, found, in, the, pages, of, the, saint, john, s, bible, a, particularly, modern, example, is, timothy, botts, illustrated, edition, of, the, bible, with, 360, calligraphic, images, as, well, as, a, calligraphy, typeface, islamic, calligraphy, has, evolved, alongside, islam, and, the, arabic, language, as, it, is, based, on, arabic, letters, some, call, it, arabic, calligraphy, however, the, term, islamic, calligraphy, is, a, more, appropriate, term, as, it, comprises, all, works, of, calligraphy, by, muslim, calligraphers, of, different, national, cultures, like, persian, or, ottoman, calligraphy, from, al, andalus, in, medieval, spain, to, china, islamic, calligraphy, is, associated, with, geometric, islamic, art, arabesque, on, the, walls, and, ceilings, of, mosques, as, well, as, on, the, page, or, other, materials, contemporary, artists, in, the, islamic, world, may, draw, on, the, heritage, of, calligraphy, to, create, modern, calligraphic, inscriptions, like, corporate, logos, or, abstractions, instead, of, recalling, something, related, to, the, spoken, word, calligraphy, for, muslims, is, a, visible, expression, of, the, highest, art, of, all, the, art, of, the, spiritual, world, calligraphy, has, arguably, become, the, most, venerated, form, of, islamic, art, because, it, provides, a, link, between, the, languages, of, the, muslims, with, the, religion, of, islam, the, qur, an, has, played, an, important, role, in, the, development, and, evolution, of, the, arabic, language, and, by, extension, calligraphy, in, the, arabic, alphabet, proverbs, and, passages, from, the, qur, an, are, still, sources, for, islamic, calligraphy, during, the, ottoman, civilization, islamic, calligraphy, attained, special, prominence, the, city, of, istanbul, is, an, open, exhibition, hall, for, all, kinds, and, varieties, of, calligraphy, from, inscriptions, in, mosques, to, fountains, schools, houses, etc, it, is, believed, that, ancient, persian, script, was, invented, by, about, 600, 500, bce, to, provide, monument, inscriptions, for, the, achaemenid, kings, these, scripts, consisted, of, horizontal, vertical, and, diagonal, nail, shape, letters, which, is, why, it, is, called, cuneiform, script, lit, script, of, nails, khat, e, mikhi, in, persian, centuries, later, other, scripts, such, as, pahlavi, and, avestan, scripts, were, used, in, ancient, persia, pahlavi, was, a, middle, persian, script, developed, from, the, aramaic, script, and, became, the, official, script, of, the, sassanian, empire, 224, 651, ce, the, nasta, liq, style, is, the, most, popular, contemporary, style, among, classical, persian, calligraphy, scripts, persian, calligraphers, call, it, the, bride, of, calligraphy, scripts, this, calligraphy, style, has, been, based, on, such, a, strong, structure, that, it, has, changed, very, little, since, mir, ali, tabrizi, had, found, the, optimum, composition, of, the, letters, and, graphical, rules, it, has, just, been, fine, tuned, during, the, past, seven, centuries, it, has, very, strict, rules, for, graphical, shape, of, the, letters, and, for, combination, of, the, letters, words, and, composition, of, the, whole, calligraphy, piece, after, printing, became, ubiquitous, from, the, 15th, century, onward, the, production, of, illuminated, manuscripts, began, to, decline, however, the, rise, of, printing, did, not, mean, the, end, of, calligraphy, a, clear, distinction, between, handwriting, and, more, elaborate, forms, of, lettering, and, script, began, to, make, its, way, into, manuscripts, and, books, at, the, beginning, of, the, 16th, century, the, modern, revival, of, calligraphy, began, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, influenced, by, the, aesthetics, and, philosophy, of, william, morris, and, the, arts, and, crafts, movement, edward, johnston, is, regarded, as, being, the, father, of, modern, calligraphy, after, studying, published, copies, of,
