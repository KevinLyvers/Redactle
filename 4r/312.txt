singing, is, the, act, of, creating, musical, sounds, with, the, voice, a, person, whose, profession, is, singing, is, called, a, singer, artist, or, vocalist, in, jazz, and, or, popular, music, singers, perform, music, arias, recitatives, songs, etc, that, can, be, sung, with, or, without, accompaniment, by, musical, instruments, singing, is, often, done, in, an, ensemble, of, musicians, such, as, a, choir, singers, may, perform, as, soloists, or, accompanied, by, anything, from, a, single, instrument, as, in, art, songs, or, some, jazz, styles, up, to, a, symphony, orchestra, or, big, band, many, styles, of, singing, exist, throughout, the, world, singing, can, be, formal, or, informal, arranged, or, improvised, it, may, be, done, as, a, form, of, religious, devotion, as, a, hobby, as, a, source, of, pleasure, comfort, as, part, of, a, ritual, during, music, education, or, as, a, profession, excellence, in, singing, requires, time, dedication, instruction, and, regular, practice, if, practice, is, done, regularly, then, the, sounds, can, become, clearer, and, stronger, professional, singers, usually, build, their, careers, around, one, specific, musical, genre, such, as, classical, or, rock, although, there, are, singers, with, crossover, success, singing, in, more, than, one, genre, professional, singers, usually, take, voice, training, provided, by, voice, teachers, or, vocal, coaches, throughout, their, careers, in, its, physical, aspect, singing, has, a, well, defined, technique, that, depends, on, the, use, of, the, lungs, which, act, as, an, air, supply, or, bellows, on, the, larynx, which, acts, as, a, reed, or, vibrator, on, the, chest, head, cavities, and, the, skeleton, which, have, the, function, of, an, amplifier, as, the, tube, in, a, wind, instrument, and, on, the, tongue, which, together, with, the, palate, teeth, and, lips, articulate, and, impose, consonants, and, vowels, on, the, amplified, sound, though, these, four, mechanisms, function, independently, they, are, nevertheless, coordinated, in, the, establishment, of, a, vocal, technique, and, are, made, to, interact, upon, one, another, during, passive, breathing, air, is, inhaled, with, the, diaphragm, while, exhalation, occurs, without, any, effort, exhalation, may, be, aided, by, the, abdominal, internal, intercostal, and, lower, pelvis, pelvic, muscles, inhalation, is, aided, by, use, of, external, intercostals, scalenes, and, sternocleidomastoid, muscles, the, pitch, is, altered, with, the, vocal, cords, with, the, lips, closed, this, is, called, humming, the, sound, of, each, individual, s, singing, voice, is, entirely, unique, not, only, because, of, the, actual, shape, and, size, of, an, individual, s, vocal, cords, but, also, due, to, the, size, and, shape, of, the, rest, of, that, person, s, body, humans, have, vocal, folds, which, can, loosen, tighten, or, change, their, thickness, and, over, which, breath, can, be, transferred, at, varying, pressures, the, shape, of, the, chest, and, neck, the, position, of, the, tongue, and, the, tightness, of, otherwise, unrelated, muscles, can, be, altered, any, one, of, these, actions, results, in, a, change, in, pitch, volume, loudness, timbre, or, tone, of, the, sound, produced, sound, also, resonates, within, different, parts, of, the, body, and, an, individual, s, size, and, bone, structure, can, affect, the, sound, produced, by, an, individual, singers, can, also, learn, to, project, sound, in, certain, ways, so, that, it, resonates, better, within, their, vocal, tract, this, is, known, as, vocal, resonation, another, major, influence, on, vocal, sound, and, production, is, the, function, of, the, larynx, which, people, can, manipulate, in, different, ways, to, produce, different, sounds, these, different, kinds, of, laryngeal, function, are, described, as, different, kinds, of, vocal, registers, the, primary, method, for, singers, to, accomplish, this, is, through, the, use, of, the, singer, s, formant, which, has, been, shown, to, match, particularly, well, to, the, most, sensitive, part, of, the, ear, s, frequency, range, it, has, also, been, shown, that, a, more, powerful, voice, may, be, achieved, with, a, fatter, and, fluid, like, vocal, fold, mucosa, the, more, pliable, the, mucosa, the, more, efficient, the, transfer, of, energy, from, the, airflow, to, the, vocal, folds, in, european, classical, music, and, opera, voices, are, treated, like, musical, instruments, composers, who, write, vocal, music, must, have, an, understanding, of, the, skills, talents, and, vocal, properties, of, singers, voice, classification, is, the, process, by, which, human, singing, voices, are, evaluated, and, are, thereby, designated, into, voice, types, these, qualities, include, but, are, not, limited, to, vocal, range, vocal, weight, vocal, tessitura, vocal, timbre, and, vocal, transition, points, such, as, breaks, and, lifts, within, the, voice, other, considerations, are, physical, characteristics, speech, level, scientific, testing, and, vocal, registration, the, science, behind, voice, classification, developed, within, european, classical, music, has, been, slow, in, adapting, to, more, modern, forms, of, singing, voice, classification, is, often, used, within, opera, to, associate, possible, roles, with, potential, voices, there, are, currently, several, different, systems, in, use, within, classical, music, including, the, german, fach, system, and, the, choral, music, system, among, many, others, no, system, is, universally, applied, or, accepted, however, most, classical, music, systems, acknowledge, seven, different, major, voice, categories, women, are, typically, divided, into, three, groups, soprano, mezzo, soprano, and, contralto, men, are, usually, divided, into, four, groups, countertenor, tenor, baritone, and, bass, with, regard, to, voices, of, pre, pubescent, children, an, eighth, term, treble, can, be, applied, within, each, of, these, major, categories, several, sub, categories, identify, specific, vocal, qualities, like, coloratura, facility, and, vocal, weight, to, differentiate, between, voices, within, choral, music, singers, voices, are, divided, solely, on, the, basis, of, vocal, range, choral, music, most, commonly, divides, vocal, parts, into, high, and, low, voices, within, each, sex, satb, or, soprano, alto, tenor, and, bass, as, a, result, the, typical, choral, situation, gives, many, opportunities, for, misclassification, to, occur, since, most, people, have, medium, voices, they, must, be, assigned, to, a, part, that, is, either, too, high, or, too, low, for, them, the, mezzo, soprano, must, sing, soprano, or, alto, and, the, baritone, must, sing, tenor, or, bass, either, option, can, present, problems, for, the, singer, but, for, most, singers, there, are, fewer, dangers, in, singing, too, low, than, in, singing, too, high, within, contemporary, forms, of, music, sometimes, referred, to, as, contemporary, commercial, music, singers, are, classified, by, the, style, of, music, they, sing, such, as, jazz, pop, blues, soul, country, folk, and, rock, styles, there, is, currently, no, authoritative, voice, classification, system, within, non, classical, music, attempts, have, been, made, to, adopt, classical, voice, type, terms, to, other, forms, of, singing, but, such, attempts, have, been, met, with, controversy, the, development, of, voice, categorizations, were, made, with, the, understanding, that, the, singer, would, be, using, classical, vocal, technique, within, a, specified, range, using, unamplified, no, microphones, vocal, production, since, contemporary, musicians, use, different, vocal, techniques, and, microphones, and, are, not, forced, to, fit, into, a, specific, vocal, role, applying, such, terms, as, soprano, tenor, baritone, etc, can, be, misleading, or, even, inaccurate, vocal, registration, refers, to, the, system, of, vocal, registers, within, the, voice, a, register, in, the, voice, is, a, particular, series, of, tones, produced, in, the, same, vibratory, pattern, of, the, vocal, folds, and, possessing, the, same, quality, registers, originate, in, laryngeal, function, they, occur, because, the, vocal, folds, are, capable, of, producing, several, different, vibratory, patterns, each, of, these, vibratory, patterns, appears, within, a, particular, range, of, pitches, and, produces, certain, characteristic, sounds, the, occurrence, of, registers, has, also, been, attributed, to, the, effects, of, the, acoustic, interaction, between, the, vocal, fold, oscillation, and, the, vocal, tract, the, term, register, can, be, somewhat, confusing, as, it, encompasses, several, aspects, of, the, voice, the, term, register, can, be, used, to, refer, to, any, of, the, following, in, linguistics, a, register, language, is, a, language, which, combines, tone, and, vowel, phonation, into, a, single, phonological, system, within, speech, pathology, the, term, vocal, register, has, three, constituent, elements, a, certain, vibratory, pattern, of, the, vocal, folds, a, certain, series, of, pitches, and, a, certain, type, of, sound, speech, pathologists, identify, four, vocal, registers, based, on, the, physiology, of, laryngeal, function, the, vocal, fry, register, the, modal, register, the, falsetto, register, and, the, whistle, register, this, view, is, also, adopted, by, many, vocal, pedagogues, vocal, resonation, is, the, process, by, which, the, basic, product, of, phonation, is, enhanced, in, timbre, and, or, intensity, by, the, air, filled, cavities, through, which, it, passes, on, its, way, to, the, outside, air, various, terms, related, to, the, resonation, process, include, amplification, enrichment, enlargement, improvement, intensification, and, prolongation, although, in, strictly, scientific, usage, acoustic, authorities, would, question, most, of, them, the, main, point, to, be, drawn, from, these, terms, by, a, singer, or, speaker, is, that, the, result, of, resonation, is, or, should, be, to, make, a, better, sound, there, are, seven, areas, that, may, be, listed, as, possible, vocal, resonators, in, sequence, from, the, lowest, within, the, body, to, the, highest, these, areas, are, the, chest, the, tracheal, tree, the, larynx, itself, the, pharynx, the, oral, cavity, the, nasal, cavity, and, the, sinuses, chest, voice, and, head, voice, are, terms, used, within, vocal, music, the, use, of, these, terms, varies, widely, within, vocal, pedagogical, circles, and, there, is, currently, no, one, consistent, opinion, among, vocal, music, professionals, in, regards, to, these, terms, chest, voice, can, be, used, in, relation, to, a, particular, part, of, the, vocal, range, or, type, of, vocal, register, a, vocal, resonance, area, or, a, specific, vocal, timbre, head, voice, can, be, used, in, relation, to, a, particular, part, of, the, vocal, range, or, type, of, vocal, register, or, a, vocal, resonance, area, in, men, the, head, voice, is, commonly, referred, to, as, the, falsetto, the, transition, from, and, combination, of, chest, voice, and, head, voice, is, referred, to, as, vocal, mix, or, vocal, mixing, in, the, singer, s, performance, vocal, mixing, can, be, inflected, in, specific, modalities, of, artists, who, may, concentrate, on, smooth, transitions, between, chest, voice, and, head, voice, and, those, who, may, use, a, flip, to, describe, the, sudden, transition, from, chest, voice, to, head, voice, for, artistic, reasons, and, enhancement, of, vocal, performances, the, first, recorded, mention, of, the, terms, chest, voice, and, head, voice, was, around, the, 13th, century, when, it, was, distinguished, from, the, throat, voice, pectoris, guttoris, capitis, at, this, time, it, is, likely, that, head, voice, referred, to, the, falsetto, register, by, the, writers, johannes, de, garlandia, and, jerome, of, moravia, the, terms, were, later, adopted, within, bel, canto, the, italian, opera, singing, method, where, chest, voice, was, identified, as, the, lowest, and, head, voice, the, highest, of, three, vocal, registers, the, chest, passagio, and, head, registers, this, approach, is, still, taught, by, some, vocal, pedagogists, today, another, current, popular, approach, that, is, based, on, the, bel, canto, model, is, to, divide, both, men, and, women, s, voices, into, three, registers, men, s, voices, are, divided, into, chest, register, head, register, and, falsetto, register, and, woman, s, voices, into, chest, register, middle, register, and, head, register, such, pedagogists, teach, that, the, head, register, is, a, vocal, technique, used, in, singing, to, describe, the, resonance, felt, in, the, singer, s, head, however, as, knowledge, of, physiology, has, increased, over, the, past, two, hundred, years, so, has, the, understanding, of, the, physical, process, of, singing, and, vocal, production, as, a, result, many, vocal, pedagogists, such, as, ralph, appelman, at, indiana, university, and, william, vennard, at, the, university, of, southern, california, have, redefined, or, even, abandoned, the, use, of, the, terms, chest, voice, and, head, voice, in, particular, the, use, of, the, terms, chest, register, and, head, register, have, become, controversial, since, vocal, registration, is, more, commonly, seen, today, as, a, product, of, laryngeal, function, that, is, unrelated, to, the, physiology, of, the, chest, lungs, and, head, for, this, reason, many, vocal, pedagogists, argue, that, it, is, meaningless, to, speak, of, registers, being, produced, in, the, chest, or, head, they, argue, that, the, vibratory, sensations, which, are, felt, in, these, areas, are, resonance, phenomena, and, should, be, described, in, terms, related, to, vocal, resonance, not, to, registers, these, vocal, pedagogists, prefer, the, terms, chest, voice, and, head, voice, over, the, term, register, this, view, believes, that, the, problems, which, people, identify, as, register, problems, are, really, problems, of, resonance, adjustment, this, view, is, also, in, alignment, with, the, views, of, other, academic, fields, that, study, vocal, registration, including, speech, pathology, phonetics, and, linguistics, although, both, methods, are, still, in, use, current, vocal, pedagogical, practice, tends, to, adopt, the, newer, more, scientific, view, also, some, vocal, pedagogists, take, ideas, from, both, viewpoints, the, contemporary, use, of, the, term, chest, voice, often, refers, to, a, specific, kind, of, vocal, coloration, or, vocal, timbre, in, classical, singing, its, use, is, limited, entirely, to, the, lower, part, of, the, modal, register, or, normal, voice, within, other, forms, of, singing, chest, voice, is, often, applied, throughout, the, modal, register, chest, timbre, can, add, a, wonderful, array, of, sounds, to, a, singer, s, vocal, interpretive, palette, however, the, use, of, an, overly, strong, chest, voice, in, the, higher, registers, in, an, attempt, to, hit, higher, notes, in, the, chest, can, lead, to, forcing, forcing, can, lead, consequently, to, vocal, deterioration, passaggio, italian, pronunciation, is, a, term, used, in, classical, singing, to, describe, the, transition, area, between, the, vocal, registers, the, passaggi, plural, of, the, voice, lie, between, the, different, vocal, registers, such, as, the, chest, voice, where, any, singer, can, produce, a, powerful, sound, the, middle, voice, and, the, head, voice, where, a, penetrating, sound, is, accessible, but, usually, only, through, vocal, training, the, historic, italian, school, of, singing, describes, a, primo, passaggio, and, a, secondo, passaggio, connected, through, a, zona, di, passaggio, in, the, male, voice, and, a, primo, passaggio, and, secondo, passaggio, in, the, female, voice, a, major, goal, of, classical, voice, training, in, classical, styles, is, to, maintain, an, even, timbre, throughout, the, passaggio, through, proper, training, it, is, possible, to, produce, a, resonant, and, powerful, sound, one, cannot, adequately, discuss, the, vocal, passaggio, without, having, a, basic, understanding, of, the, different, vocal, registers, in, his, book, the, principles, of, voice, production, ingo, titze, states, the, term, register, has, been, used, to, describe, perceptually, distinct, regions, of, vocal, quality, that, can, be, maintained, over, some, ranges, of, pitch, and, loudness, discrepancies, in, terminology, exist, between, different, fields, of, vocal, study, such, as, teachers, and, singers, researchers, and, clinicians, as, marilee, david, points, out, voice, scientists, see, registration, primarily, as, acoustic, events, for, singers, it, is, more, common, to, explain, registration, events, based, on, the, physical, sensations, they, feel, when, singing, titze, also, explains, that, there, are, discrepancies, in, the, terminology, used, to, talk, about, vocal, registration, between, speech, pathologists, and, singing, teachers, since, this, article, discusses, the, passaggio, which, is, a, term, used, by, classical, singers, the, registers, will, be, discussed, as, they, are, in, the, field, of, singing, rather, than, speech, pathology, and, science, the, three, main, registers, described, as, head, middle, mixed, and, chest, voice, are, described, as, having, a, rich, timbre, because, of, the, overtones, due, to, the, sympathetic, resonance, within, the, human, body, their, names, are, derived, from, the, area, in, which, the, singer, feels, these, resonant, vibration, in, the, body, the, chest, register, more, commonly, referred, to, as, the, chest, voice, is, the, lowest, of, the, registers, when, singing, in, the, chest, voice, the, singer, feels, sympathetic, vibration, in, the, chest, this, is, the, register, that, people, most, commonly, use, while, speaking, the, middle, voice, falls, in, between, the, chest, voice, and, head, voice, the, head, register, or, the, head, voice, is, the, highest, of, the, main, vocal, registers, when, singing, in, the, head, voice, the, singer, may, feel, sympathetic, vibration, occurring, in, the, face, or, another, part, of, the, head, where, these, registers, lie, in, the, voice, is, dependent, on, sex, and, the, voice, type, within, each, sex, there, are, an, additional, two, registers, called, falsetto, and, flageolet, register, which, lie, above, their, head, register, training, is, often, required, to, access, the, pitches, within, these, registers, men, and, women, with, lower, voices, rarely, sing, in, these, registers, lower, voiced, women, in, particular, receive, very, little, if, any, training, in, the, flageolet, register, men, have, one, more, additional, register, called, the, strohbass, which, lies, below, the, chest, voice, singing, in, this, register, is, hard, on, the, vocal, cords, and, therefore, is, hardly, ever, used, vocal, pedagogy, is, the, study, of, the, teaching, of, singing, the, art, and, science, of, vocal, pedagogy, has, a, long, history, that, began, in, ancient, greece, and, continues, to, develop, and, change, today, professions, that, practice, the, art, and, science, of, vocal, pedagogy, include, vocal, coaches, choral, directors, vocal, music, educators, opera, directors, and, other, teachers, of, singing, vocal, pedagogy, concepts, are, a, part, of, developing, proper, vocal, technique, typical, areas, of, study, include, the, following, singing, when, done, with, proper, vocal, technique, is, an, integrated, and, coordinated, act, that, effectively, coordinates, the, physical, processes, of, singing, there, are, four, physical, processes, involved, in, producing, vocal, sound, respiration, phonation, resonation, and, articulation, these, processes, occur, in, the, following, sequence, although, these, four, processes, are, often, considered, separately, when, studied, in, actual, practice, they, merge, into, one, coordinated, function, with, an, effective, singer, or, speaker, one, should, rarely, be, reminded, of, the, process, involved, as, their, mind, and, body, are, so, coordinated, that, one, only, perceives, the, resulting, unified, function, many, vocal, problems, result, from, a, lack, of, coordination, within, this, process, since, singing, is, a, coordinated, act, it, is, difficult, to, discuss, any, of, the, individual, technical, areas, and, processes, without, relating, them, to, others, for, example, phonation, only, comes, into, perspective, when, it, is, connected, with, respiration, the, articulators, affect, resonance, the, resonators, affect, the, vocal, folds, the, vocal, folds, affect, breath, control, and, so, forth, vocal, problems, are, often, a, result, of, a, breakdown, in, one, part, of, this, coordinated, process, which, causes, voice, teachers, to, frequently, focus, intensively, on, one, area, of, the, process, with, their, student, until, that, issue, is, resolved, however, some, areas, of, the, art, of, singing, are, so, much, the, result, of, coordinated, functions, that, it, is, hard, to, discuss, them, under, a, traditional, heading, like, phonation, resonation, articulation, or, respiration, once, the, voice, student, has, become, aware, of, the, physical, processes, that, make, up, the, act, of, singing, and, of, how, those, processes, function, the, student, begins, the, task, of, trying, to, coordinate, them, inevitably, students, and, teachers, will, become, more, concerned, with, one, area, of, the, technique, than, another, the, various, processes, may, progress, at, different, rates, with, a, resulting, imbalance, or, lack, of, coordination, the, areas, of, vocal, technique, which, seem, to, depend, most, strongly, on, the, student, s, ability, to, coordinate, various, functions, are, singing, is, a, skill, that, requires, highly, developed, muscle, reflexes, singing, does, not, require, much, muscle, strength, but, it, does, require, a, high, degree, of, muscle, coordination, individuals, can, develop, their, voices, further, through, the, careful, and, systematic, practice, of, both, songs, and, vocal, exercises, vocal, exercises, have, several, purposes, including, warming, up, the, voice, extending, the, vocal, range, lining, up, the, voice, horizontally, and, vertically, and, acquiring, vocal, techniques, such, as, legato, staccato, control, of, dynamics, rapid, figurations, learning, to, sing, wide, intervals, comfortably, singing, trills, singing, melismas, and, correcting, vocal, faults, vocal, pedagogists, instruct, their, students, to, exercise, their, voices, in, an, intelligent, manner, singers, should, be, thinking, constantly, about, the, kind, of, sound, they, are, making, and, the, kind, of, sensations, they, are, feeling, while, they, are, singing, learning, to, sing, is, an, activity, that, benefits, from, the, involvement, of, an, instructor, a, singer, does, not, hear, the, same, sounds, inside, his, or, her, head, that, others, hear, outside, therefore, having, a, guide, who, can, tell, a, student, what, kinds, of, sounds, he, or, she, is, producing, guides, a, singer, to, understand, which, of, the, internal, sounds, correspond, to, the, desired, sounds, required, by, the, style, of, singing, the, student, aims, to, re, create, an, important, goal, of, vocal, development, is, to, learn, to, sing, to, the, natural, limits, of, one, s, vocal, range, without, any, obvious, or, distracting, changes, of, quality, or, technique, vocal, pedagogists, teach, that, a, singer, can, only, achieve, this, goal, when, all, of, the, physical, processes, involved, in, singing, such, as, laryngeal, action, breath, support, resonance, adjustment, and, articulatory, movement, are, effectively, working, together, most, vocal, pedagogists, believe, in, coordinating, these, processes, by, 1, establishing, good, vocal, habits, in, the, most, comfortable, tessitura, of, the, voice, and, then, 2, slowly, expanding, the, range, there, are, three, factors, that, significantly, affect, the, ability, to, sing, higher, or, lower, mckinney, says, these, three, factors, can, be, expressed, in, three, basic, rules, 1, as, you, sing, higher, you, must, use, more, energy, as, you, sing, lower, you, must, use, less, 2, as, you, sing, higher, you, must, use, more, space, as, you, sing, lower, you, must, use, less, 3, as, you, sing, higher, you, must, use, more, depth, as, you, sing, lower, you, must, use, less, the, singing, process, functions, best, when, certain, physical, conditions, of, the, body, are, put, in, place, the, ability, to, move, air, in, and, out, of, the, body, freely, and, to, obtain, the, needed, quantity, of, air, can, be, seriously, affected, by, the, posture, of, the, various, parts, of, the, breathing, mechanism, a, sunken, chest, position, will, limit, the, capacity, of, the, lungs, and, a, tense, abdominal, wall, will, inhibit, the, downward, travel, of, the, diaphragm, good, posture, allows, the, breathing, mechanism, to, fulfill, its, basic, function, efficiently, without, any, undue, expenditure, of, energy, good, posture, also, makes, it, easier, to, initiate, phonation, and, to, tune, the, resonators, as, proper, alignment, prevents, unnecessary, tension, in, the, body, vocal, pedagogists, have, also, noted, that, when, singers, assume, good, posture, it, often, provides, them, with, a, greater, sense, of, self, assurance, and, poise, while, performing, audiences, also, tend, to, respond, better, to, singers, with, good, posture, habitual, good, posture, also, ultimately, improves, the, overall, health, of, the, body, by, enabling, better, blood, circulation, and, preventing, fatigue, and, stress, on, the, body, there, are, eight, components, of, the, ideal, singing, posture, natural, breathing, has, three, stages, a, breathing, in, period, breathing, out, period, and, a, resting, or, recovery, period, these, stages, are, not, usually, consciously, controlled, within, singing, there, are, four, stages, of, breathing, a, breathing, in, period, inhalation, a, setting, up, controls, period, suspension, a, controlled, exhalation, period, phonation, and, a, recovery, period, these, stages, must, be, under, conscious, control, by, the, singer, until, they, become, conditioned, reflexes, many, singers, abandon, conscious, controls, before, their, reflexes, are, fully, conditioned, which, ultimately, leads, to, chronic, vocal, problems, vibrato, is, a, technique, in, which, a, sustained, note, wavers, very, quickly, and, consistently, between, a, higher, and, a, lower, pitch, giving, the, note, a, slight, quaver, vibrato, is, the, pulse, or, wave, in, a, sustained, tone, vibrato, occurs, naturally, and, is, the, result, of, proper, breath, support, and, a, relaxed, vocal, apparatus, some, studies, have, shown, that, vibrato, is, the, result, of, a, neuromuscular, tremor, in, the, vocal, folds, in, 1922, max, schoen, was, the, first, to, make, the, comparison, of, vibrato, to, a, tremor, due, to, change, in, amplitude, lack, of, automatic, control, and, it, being, half, the, rate, of, normal, muscular, discharge, some, singers, use, vibrato, as, a, means, of, expression, many, successful, artists, can, sing, a, deep, rich, vibrato, extended, vocal, techniques, include, rapping, screaming, growling, overtones, sliding, falsetto, yodeling, belting, use, of, vocal, fry, register, using, sound, reinforcement, systems, among, others, a, sound, reinforcement, system, is, the, combination, of, microphones, signal, processors, amplifiers, and, loudspeakers, the, combination, of, such, units, may, also, use, reverb, echo, chambers, and, auto, tune, among, other, devices, vocal, music, is, music, performed, by, one, or, more, singers, which, are, typically, called, songs, and, which, may, be, performed, with, or, without, instrumental, accompaniment, in, which, singing, provides, the, main, focus, of, the, piece, vocal, music, is, probably, the, oldest, form, of, music, since, it, does, not, require, any, instrument, or, equipment, besides, the, voice, all, musical, cultures, have, some, form, of, vocal, music, and, there, are, many, long, standing, singing, traditions, throughout, the, world, s, cultures, music, which, employs, singing, but, does, not, feature, it, prominently, is, generally, considered, instrumental, music, for, example, some, blues, rock, songs, may, have, a, short, simple, call, and, response, chorus, but, the, emphasis, in, the, song, is, on, the, instrumental, melodies, and, improvisation, vocal, music, typically, features, sung, words, called, lyrics, although, there, are, notable, examples, of, vocal, music, that, are, performed, using, non, linguistic, syllables, or, noises, sometimes, as, musical, onomatopoeia, a, short, piece, of, vocal, music, with, lyrics, is, broadly, termed, a, song, although, in, classical, music, terms, such, as, aria, are, typically, used, vocal, music, is, written, in, many, different, forms, and, styles, which, are, often, labeled, within, a, particular, genre, of, music, these, genres, include, popular, music, art, music, religious, music, secular, music, and, fusions, of, such, genres, within, these, larger, genres, are, many, subgenres, for, example, popular, music, would, encompass, blues, jazz, country, music, easy, listening, hip, hop, rock, music, and, several, other, genres, there, may, also, be, a, subgenre, within, a, subgenre, such, as, vocalese, and, scat, singing, in, jazz, in, many, modern, pop, musical, groups, a, lead, singer, performs, the, primary, vocals, or, melody, of, a, song, as, opposed, to, a, backing, singer, who, sings, backup, vocals, or, the, harmony, of, a, song, backing, vocalists, sing, some, but, usually, not, all, parts, of, the, song, often, singing, only, in, a, song, s, refrain, or, humming, in, the, background, an, exception, is, five, part, gospel, a, cappella, music, where, the, lead, is, the, highest, of, the, five, voices, and, sings, a, descant, and, not, the, melody, some, artists, may, sing, both, the, lead, and, backing, vocals, on, audio, recordings, by, overlapping, recorded, vocal, tracks, popular, music, includes, a, range, of, vocal, styles, hip, hop, uses, rapping, the, rhythmic, delivery, of, rhymes, in, a, rhythmic, speech, over, a, beat, or, without, accompaniment, some, types, of, rapping, consist, mostly, or, entirely, of, speech, and, chanting, like, the, jamaican, toasting, in, some, types, of, rapping, the, performers, may, interpolate, short, sung, or, half, sung, passages, blues, singing, is, based, on, the, use, of, the, blue, notes, notes, sung, at, a, slightly, lower, pitch, than, that, of, the, major, scale, for, expressive, purposes, in, heavy, metal, and, hardcore, punk, subgenres, vocal, styles, can, include, techniques, such, as, screams, shouts, and, unusual, sounds, such, as, the, death, growl, one, difference, between, live, performances, in, the, popular, and, classical, genres, is, that, whereas, classical, performers, often, sing, without, amplification, in, small, to, mid, size, halls, in, popular, music, a, microphone, and, pa, system, amplifier, and, speakers, are, used, in, almost, all, performance, venues, even, a, small, coffee, house, the, use, of, the, microphone, has, had, several, impacts, on, popular, music, for, one, it, facilitated, the, development, of, intimate, expressive, singing, styles, such, as, crooning, which, would, not, have, enough, projection, and, volume, if, done, without, a, microphone, as, well, pop, singers, who, use, microphones, can, do, a, range, of, other, vocal, styles, that, would, not, project, without, amplification, such, as, making, whispering, sounds, humming, and, mixing, half, sung, and, sung, tones, as, well, some, performers, use, the, microphone, s, response, patterns, to, create, effects, such, as, bringing, the, mic, very, close, to, the, mouth, to, get, an, enhanced, bass, response, or, in, the, case, of, hip, hop, beatboxers, doing, plosive, p, and, b, sounds, into, the, mic, to, create, percussive, effects, in, the, 2000s, controversy, arose, over, the, widespread, use, of, electronic, auto, tune, pitch, correction, devices, with, recorded, and, live, popular, music, vocals, controversy, has, also, arisen, due, to, cases, where, pop, singers, have, been, found, to, be, lip, syncing, to, a, pre, recorded, recording, of, their, vocal, performance, or, in, the, case, of, the, controversial, act, milli, vanilli, lip, syncing, to, tracks, recorded, by, other, uncredited, singers, while, some, bands, use, backup, singers, who, only, sing, when, they, are, on, stage, it, is, common, for, backup, singers, in, popular, music, to, have, other, roles, in, many, rock, and, metal, bands, the, musicians, doing, backup, vocals, also, play, instruments, such, as, rhythm, guitar, electric, bass, or, drums, in, latin, or, afro, cuban, groups, backup, singers, may, play, percussion, instruments, or, shakers, while, singing, in, some, pop, and, hip, hop, groups, and, in, musical, theater, the, backup, singers, may, be, required, to, perform, elaborately, choreographed, dance, routines, while, they, sing, through, headset, microphones, the, salaries, and, working, conditions, for, vocalists, vary, a, great, deal, while, jobs, in, other, music, fields, such, as, music, education, choir, conductors, tend, to, be, based, on, full, time, salaried, positions, singing, jobs, tend, to, be, based, on, contracts, for, individual, shows, or, performances, or, for, a, sequence, of, shows, aspiring, singers, and, vocalists, must, have, musical, skills, an, excellent, voice, the, ability, to, work, with, people, and, a, sense, of, showmanship, and, drama, additionally, singers, need, to, have, the, ambition, and, drive, to, continually, study, and, improve, professional, singers, continue, to, seek, out, vocal, coaching, to, hone, their, skills, extend, their, range, and, learn, new, styles, as, well, aspiring, singers, need, to, gain, specialized, skills, in, the, vocal, techniques, used, to, interpret, songs, learn, about, the, vocal, literature, from, their, chosen, style, of, music, and, gain, skills, in, choral, music, techniques, sight, singing, and, memorizing, songs, and, vocal, exercises, some, singers, learn, other, music, jobs, such, as, the, composing, music, producing, and, songwriting, some, singers, put, videos, on, youtube, and, streaming, apps, singers, market, themselves, to, buyers, of, vocal, talent, by, doing, auditions, in, front, of, a, music, director, depending, on, the, style, of, vocal, music, that, a, person, has, trained, in, the, talent, buyers, that, they, seek, out, may, be, record, company, a, r, representatives, music, directors, choir, directors, nightclub, managers, or, concert, promoters, a, cd, or, dvd, with, excerpts, of, vocal, performances, is, used, to, demonstrate, a, singer, s, skills, some, singers, hire, an, agent, or, manager, to, help, them, to, seek, out, paid, engagements, and, other, performance, opportunities, the, agent, or, manager, is, often, paid, by, receiving, a, percentage, of, the, fees, that, the, singer, gets, from, performing, onstage, there, are, several, television, shows, that, showcase, singing, american, idol, was, launched, in, 2002, the, first, singing, reality, show, was, sa, re, ga, ma, pa, launched, by, zee, tv, in, 1995, at, the, american, idol, contestants, audition, in, front, of, a, panel, of, judges, to, see, if, they, can, move, on, to, the, next, round, in, hollywood, from, then, the, competition, begins, the, field, of, contestants, is, narrowed, down, week, by, week, until, a, winner, is, chosen, to, move, on, to, the, next, round, the, contestants, fate, is, determined, by, a, vote, by, viewers, the, voice, is, another, singing, competition, program, similar, to, american, idol, the, contestants, audition, in, front, of, a, panel, of, judges, however, the, judges, chairs, are, faced, towards, the, audience, during, the, performance, if, the, coaches, are, interested, in, the, artist, they, will, press, their, button, signifying, they, want, to, coach, them, once, the, auditions, conclude, coaches, have, their, team, of, artists, and, the, competition, begins, coaches, then, mentor, their, artists, and, they, compete, to, find, the, best, singer, other, well, known, singing, competitions, include, the, x, factor, america, s, got, talent, rising, star, and, the, sing, off, a, different, example, of, a, singing, competition, is, don, t, forget, the, lyrics, where, the, show, s, contestants, compete, to, win, cash, prizes, by, correctly, recalling, song, lyrics, from, a, variety, of, genres, the, show, contrasts, to, many, other, music, based, game, shows, in, that, artistic, talent, such, as, the, ability, to, sing, or, dance, in, an, aesthetically, pleasing, way, is, irrelevant, to, the, contestants, chances, of, winning, in, the, words, of, one, of, their, commercials, prior, to, the, first, airing, you, don, t, have, to, sing, it, well, you, just, have, to, sing, it, right, in, a, similar, vein, the, singing, bee, combines, karaoke, singing, with, a, spelling, bee, style, competition, with, the, show, featuring, contestants, trying, to, remember, the, lyrics, to, popular, songs, every, spoken, language, natural, or, non, natural, language, has, its, own, intrinsic, musicality, which, affects, singing, by, means, of, pitch, phrasing, and, accent, much, research, has, been, done, recently, on, the, link, between, music, and, language, especially, singing, it, is, becoming, increasingly, clear, that, these, two, processes, are, very, much, alike, and, yet, also, different, levitin, describes, how, beginning, with, the, eardrum, sound, waves, are, translated, into, pitch, or, a, tonotopic, map, and, then, shortly, thereafter, speech, and, music, probably, diverge, into, separate, processing, circuits, 130, there, is, evidence, that, neural, circuits, used, for, music, and, language, may, start, out, in, infants, undifferentiated, there, are, several, areas, of, the, brain, that, are, used, for, both, language, and, music, for, example, brodmann, area, 47, which, has, been, implicated, in, the, processing, of, syntax, in, oral, and, sign, languages, as, well, as, musical, syntax, and, semantic, aspects, of, language, levitin, recounts, how, in, certain, studies, listening, to, music, and, attending, its, syntactic, features, similar, to, the, syntactic, processes, in, language, activated, this, part, of, the, brain, in, addition, musical, syntax, has, been, localized, to, areas, adjacent, to, and, overlapping, with, those, regions, that, process, speech, syntax, such, as, broca, s, area, and, the, regions, involved, in, musical, semantics, appear, to, be, near, wernicke, s, area, both, broca, s, area, and, wernicke, s, area, are, important, steps, in, language, processing, and, production, singing, has, been, shown, to, help, stroke, victims, recover, speech, according, to, neurologist, gottfried, schlaug, there, is, a, corresponding, area, to, that, of, speech, which, resides, in, the, left, hemisphere, on, the, right, side, of, the, brain, this, is, casually, known, as, the, singing, center, by, teaching, stroke, victims, to, sing, their, words, this, can, help, train, this, area, of, the, brain, for, speech, in, support, of, this, theory, levitin, asserts, that, regional, specificity, such, as, that, for, speech, may, be, temporary, as, the, processing, centers, for, important, mental, functions, actually, move, to, other, regions, after, trauma, or, brain, damage, thus, in, the, right, hemisphere, of, the, brain, the, singing, center, may, be, retrained, to, help, produce, speech, the, speaking, dialect, or, accent, of, a, person, may, differ, greatly, from, the, general, singing, accent, that, a, person, uses, while, singing, when, people, sing, they, generally, use, the, accent, or, neutral, accent, that, is, used, in, the, style, of, music, they, are, singing, in, rather, than, a, regional, accent, or, dialect, the, style, of, music, and, the, popular, center, region, of, the, style, has, more, influence, on, the, singing, accent, of, a, person, than, where, they, come, from, for, example, in, the, english, language, british, singers, of, rock, or, popular, music, often, sing, in, an, american, accent, or, neutral, accent, instead, of, an, english, accent
