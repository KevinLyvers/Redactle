funk, is, a, music, genre, that, originated, in, african, american, communities, in, the, mid, 1960s, when, musicians, created, a, rhythmic, danceable, new, form, of, music, through, a, mixture, of, various, music, genres, that, were, popular, among, african, americans, in, the, mid, 20th, century, it, deemphasizes, melody, and, chord, progressions, and, focuses, on, a, strong, rhythmic, groove, of, a, bassline, played, by, an, electric, bassist, and, a, drum, part, played, by, a, percussionist, often, at, slower, tempos, than, other, popular, music, funk, typically, consists, of, a, complex, percussive, groove, with, rhythm, instruments, playing, interlocking, grooves, that, create, a, hypnotic, and, danceable, feel, it, uses, the, same, richly, colored, extended, chords, found, in, bebop, jazz, such, as, minor, chords, with, added, sevenths, and, elevenths, and, dominant, seventh, chords, with, altered, ninths, and, thirteenths, funk, originated, in, the, mid, 1960s, with, james, brown, s, development, of, a, signature, groove, that, emphasized, the, downbeat, with, a, heavy, emphasis, on, the, first, beat, of, every, measure, the, one, and, the, application, of, swung, 16th, notes, and, syncopation, on, all, basslines, drum, patterns, and, guitar, riffs, rock, and, psychedelia, influenced, musicians, sly, and, the, family, stone, and, parliament, funkadelic, fostered, more, eclectic, examples, of, the, genre, beginning, in, the, late, 1960s, other, musical, groups, developed, brown, s, innovations, during, the, 1970s, and, the, 1980s, including, kool, and, the, gang, ohio, players, fatback, band, jimmy, castor, bunch, earth, wind, fire, b, t, express, shalamar, one, way, lakeside, dazz, band, the, gap, band, slave, aurra, roger, troutman, zapp, con, funk, shun, cameo, bar, kays, and, chic, funk, derivatives, include, avant, funk, an, avant, garde, strain, of, funk, boogie, a, hybrid, of, electronic, music, and, funk, funk, metal, g, funk, a, mix, of, gangsta, rap, and, psychedelic, funk, timba, a, form, of, funky, cuban, dance, music, and, funk, jam, it, is, also, the, main, influence, of, washington, go, go, a, funk, subgenre, funk, samples, and, breakbeats, have, been, used, extensively, in, hip, hop, and, electronic, dance, music, the, word, funk, initially, referred, and, still, refers, to, a, strong, odor, it, is, originally, derived, from, latin, fumigare, which, means, to, smoke, via, old, french, fungiere, and, in, this, sense, it, was, first, documented, in, english, in, 1620, in, 1784, funky, meaning, musty, was, first, documented, which, in, turn, led, to, a, sense, of, earthy, that, was, taken, up, around, 1900, in, early, jazz, slang, for, something, deeply, or, strongly, felt, even, though, in, white, culture, the, term, funk, can, have, negative, connotations, of, odor, or, being, in, a, bad, mood, in, a, funk, in, african, communities, the, term, funk, while, still, linked, to, body, odor, had, the, positive, sense, that, a, musician, s, hard, working, honest, effort, led, to, sweat, and, from, their, physical, exertion, came, an, exquisite, and, superlative, performance, in, early, jam, sessions, musicians, would, encourage, one, another, to, get, down, by, telling, one, another, now, put, some, stank, on, it, at, least, as, early, as, 1907, jazz, songs, carried, titles, such, as, funky, the, first, example, is, an, unrecorded, number, by, buddy, bolden, remembered, as, either, funky, butt, or, buddy, bolden, s, blues, with, improvised, lyrics, that, were, according, to, donald, m, marquis, either, comical, and, light, or, crude, and, downright, obscene, but, in, one, way, or, another, referring, to, the, sweaty, atmosphere, at, dances, where, bolden, s, band, played, as, late, as, the, 1950s, and, early, 1960s, when, funk, and, funky, were, used, increasingly, in, the, context, of, jazz, music, the, terms, still, were, considered, indelicate, and, inappropriate, for, use, in, polite, company, according, to, one, source, new, orleans, born, drummer, earl, palmer, was, the, first, to, use, the, word, funky, to, explain, to, other, musicians, that, their, music, should, be, made, more, syncopated, and, danceable, the, style, later, evolved, into, a, rather, hard, driving, insistent, rhythm, implying, a, more, carnal, quality, this, early, form, of, the, music, set, the, pattern, for, later, musicians, the, music, was, identified, as, slow, sexy, loose, riff, oriented, and, danceable, the, meaning, of, funk, continues, to, captivate, the, genre, of, black, music, feeling, and, knowledge, recent, scholarship, in, black, studies, has, taken, the, term, funk, in, its, many, iterations, to, consider, the, range, of, black, movement, and, culture, in, particular, l, h, stallings, s, funk, the, erotic, transaesthetics, and, black, sexual, cultures, explores, these, multiple, meanings, of, funk, as, a, way, to, theorize, sexuality, culture, and, western, hegemony, within, the, many, locations, of, funk, street, parties, drama, theater, strippers, and, strip, clubs, pornography, and, self, published, fiction, like, soul, funk, is, based, on, dance, music, so, it, has, a, strong, rhythmic, role, the, sound, of, funk, is, as, much, based, on, the, spaces, between, the, notes, as, the, notes, that, are, played, as, such, rests, between, notes, are, important, while, there, are, rhythmic, similarities, between, funk, and, disco, funk, has, a, central, dance, beat, that, s, slower, sexier, and, more, syncopated, than, disco, and, funk, rhythm, section, musicians, add, more, subtextures, complexity, and, personality, onto, the, main, beat, than, a, programmed, synth, based, disco, ensemble, before, funk, most, pop, music, was, based, on, sequences, of, eighth, notes, because, the, fast, tempos, made, further, subdivisions, of, the, beat, infeasible, the, innovation, of, funk, was, that, by, using, slower, tempos, surely, influenced, by, the, revival, of, blues, at, early, 60s, funk, created, space, for, further, rhythmic, subdivision, so, a, bar, of, 4, 4, could, now, accommodate, possible, 16, note, placements, specifically, by, having, the, guitar, and, drums, play, in, motoring, sixteenth, note, rhythms, it, created, the, opportunity, for, the, other, instruments, to, play, more, syncopated, broken, up, style, which, facilitated, a, move, to, more, liberated, basslines, together, these, interlocking, parts, created, a, hypnotic, and, danceable, feel, a, great, deal, of, funk, is, rhythmically, based, on, a, two, celled, onbeat, offbeat, structure, which, originated, in, sub, saharan, african, music, traditions, new, orleans, appropriated, the, bifurcated, structure, from, the, afro, cuban, mambo, and, conga, in, the, late, 1940s, and, made, it, its, own, new, orleans, funk, as, it, was, called, gained, international, acclaim, largely, because, james, brown, s, rhythm, section, used, it, to, great, effect, funk, uses, the, same, richly, colored, extended, chords, found, in, bebop, jazz, such, as, minor, chords, with, added, sevenths, and, elevenths, or, dominant, seventh, chords, with, altered, ninths, some, examples, of, chords, used, in, funk, are, minor, eleventh, chords, e, g, f, minor, 11th, dominant, seventh, with, added, sharp, ninth, and, a, suspended, fourth, e, g, c7, 9, sus, 4, dominant, ninth, chords, e, g, f9, and, minor, sixth, chords, e, g, c, minor, 6, the, six, ninth, chord, is, used, in, funk, e, g, f, 6, 9, it, is, a, major, chord, with, an, added, sixth, and, ninth, in, funk, minor, seventh, chords, are, more, common, than, minor, triads, because, minor, triads, were, found, to, be, too, thin, sounding, some, of, the, best, known, and, most, skillful, soloists, in, funk, have, jazz, backgrounds, trombonist, fred, wesley, and, saxophonists, pee, wee, ellis, and, maceo, parker, are, among, the, most, notable, musicians, in, the, funk, music, genre, having, worked, with, james, brown, george, clinton, and, prince, unlike, bebop, jazz, with, its, complex, rapid, fire, chord, changes, funk, often, uses, a, static, single, chord, or, two, chord, vamp, often, alternating, a, minor, seventh, chord, and, a, related, dominant, seventh, chord, such, as, a, minor, to, d7, during, all, or, part, of, a, song, with, melodo, harmonic, movement, and, a, complex, driving, rhythmic, feel, even, though, some, funk, songs, are, mainly, one, chord, vamps, the, rhythm, section, musicians, may, embellish, this, chord, by, moving, it, up, or, down, a, semitone, or, a, tone, to, create, chromatic, passing, chords, for, example, the, verse, section, of, play, that, funky, music, by, wild, cherry, mainly, uses, an, e, ninth, chord, but, it, also, uses, f, 9, and, f9, the, chords, used, in, funk, songs, typically, imply, a, dorian, or, mixolydian, mode, as, opposed, to, the, major, or, natural, minor, tonalities, of, most, popular, music, melodic, content, was, derived, by, mixing, these, modes, with, the, blues, scale, in, the, 1970s, jazz, music, drew, upon, funk, to, create, a, new, subgenre, of, jazz, funk, which, can, be, heard, in, recordings, by, miles, davis, live, evil, on, the, corner, and, herbie, hancock, head, hunters, funk, continues, the, african, musical, tradition, of, improvisation, in, that, in, a, funk, band, the, group, would, typically, feel, when, to, change, by, jamming, and, grooving, even, in, the, studio, recording, stage, which, might, only, be, based, on, the, skeleton, framework, for, each, song, funk, uses, collective, improvisation, in, which, musicians, at, rehearsals, would, have, what, was, metaphorically, a, musical, conversation, an, approach, which, extended, to, the, onstage, performances, funk, creates, an, intense, groove, by, using, strong, guitar, riffs, and, basslines, played, on, electric, bass, like, motown, recordings, funk, songs, use, basslines, as, the, centerpiece, of, songs, indeed, funk, has, been, called, the, style, in, which, the, bassline, is, most, prominent, in, the, songs, with, the, bass, playing, the, hook, of, the, song, early, funk, basslines, used, syncopation, typically, syncopated, eighth, notes, but, with, the, addition, of, more, of, a, driving, feel, than, in, new, orleans, funk, and, they, used, blues, scale, notes, along, with, the, major, third, above, the, root, later, funk, basslines, use, sixteenth, note, syncopation, blues, scales, and, repetitive, patterns, often, with, leaps, of, an, octave, or, a, larger, interval, funk, basslines, emphasize, repetitive, patterns, locked, in, grooves, continuous, playing, and, slap, and, popping, bass, slapping, and, popping, uses, a, mixture, of, thumb, slapped, low, notes, also, called, thumped, and, finger, popped, or, plucked, high, notes, allowing, the, bass, to, have, a, drum, like, rhythmic, role, which, became, a, distinctive, element, of, funk, notable, slap, and, funky, players, include, bernard, edwards, chic, robert, kool, bell, mark, adams, slave, johnny, flippin, fatback, and, bootsy, collins, while, slap, and, funky, is, important, some, influential, bassists, who, play, funk, such, as, rocco, prestia, from, tower, of, power, did, not, use, the, approach, and, instead, used, a, typical, fingerstyle, method, based, on, james, jamerson, s, motown, playing, style, larry, graham, from, sly, and, the, family, stone, is, an, influential, bassist, funk, bass, has, an, earthy, percussive, kind, of, feel, in, part, due, to, the, use, of, muted, rhythmic, ghost, notes, also, called, dead, notes, some, funk, bass, players, use, electronic, effects, units, to, alter, the, tone, of, their, instrument, such, as, envelope, filters, an, auto, wah, effect, that, creates, a, gooey, slurpy, quacky, and, syrupy, sound, and, imitate, keyboard, synthesizer, bass, tones, e, g, the, mutron, envelope, filter, and, overdriven, fuzz, bass, effects, which, are, used, to, create, the, classic, fuzz, tone, that, sounds, like, old, school, funk, records, other, effects, that, are, used, include, the, flanger, and, bass, chorus, collins, also, used, a, mu, tron, octave, divider, an, octave, pedal, that, like, the, octavia, pedal, popularized, by, hendrix, can, double, a, note, an, octave, above, and, below, to, create, a, futuristic, and, fat, low, end, sound, funk, drumming, creates, a, groove, by, emphasizing, the, drummer, s, feel, and, emotion, which, including, occasional, tempo, fluctuations, the, use, of, swing, feel, in, some, songs, e, g, cissy, strut, by, the, meters, and, i, ll, take, you, there, by, the, staple, singers, which, have, a, half, swung, feel, and, less, use, of, fills, as, they, can, lessen, the, groove, drum, fills, are, few, and, economical, to, ensure, that, the, drumming, stays, in, the, pocket, with, a, steady, tempo, and, groove, these, playing, techniques, are, supplemented, by, a, set, up, for, the, drum, kit, that, often, includes, muffled, bass, drums, and, toms, and, tightly, tuned, snare, drums, double, bass, drumming, sounds, are, often, done, by, funk, drummers, with, a, single, pedal, an, approach, which, accents, the, second, note, deadens, the, drumhead, s, resonance, which, gives, a, short, muffled, bass, drum, sound, james, brown, used, two, drummers, such, as, clyde, stubblefield, and, john, jabo, starks, in, recording, and, soul, shows, by, using, two, drummers, the, jb, band, was, able, to, maintain, a, solid, syncopated, rhythmic, sound, which, contributed, to, the, band, s, distinctive, funky, drummer, rhythm, in, tower, of, power, drummer, david, garibaldi, s, playing, there, are, many, ghost, notes, and, rim, shots, a, key, part, of, the, funk, drumming, style, is, using, the, hi, hat, with, opening, and, closing, the, hi, hats, during, playing, to, create, splash, accent, effects, being, an, important, approach, two, handed, sixteenth, notes, on, the, hi, hats, sometimes, with, a, degree, of, swing, feel, is, used, in, funk, jim, payne, states, that, funk, drumming, uses, a, wide, open, approach, to, improvisation, around, rhythmic, ideas, from, latin, music, ostinatos, that, are, repeated, with, only, slight, variations, an, approach, which, he, says, causes, the, mesmerizing, nature, of, funk, payne, states, that, funk, can, be, thought, of, as, rock, played, in, a, more, syncopated, manner, particularly, with, the, bass, drum, which, plays, syncopated, eighth, note, and, sixteenth, note, patterns, that, were, innovated, by, drummer, clive, williams, with, joe, tex, george, brown, with, kool, the, gang, and, james, diamond, williams, with, the, ohio, players, as, with, rock, the, snare, provides, backbeats, in, most, funk, albeit, with, additional, soft, ghost, notes, in, funk, guitarists, often, mix, playing, chords, of, a, short, duration, nicknamed, stabs, with, faster, rhythms, and, riffs, guitarists, playing, rhythmic, parts, often, play, sixteenth, notes, including, with, percussive, ghost, notes, chord, extensions, are, favored, such, as, ninth, chords, typically, funk, uses, two, interlocking, guitar, parts, with, a, rhythm, guitarist, and, a, tenor, guitarist, who, plays, single, notes, the, two, guitarists, trade, off, their, lines, to, create, a, call, and, response, intertwined, pocket, if, a, band, only, has, one, guitarist, this, effect, may, be, recreated, by, overdubbing, in, the, studio, or, in, a, live, show, by, having, a, single, guitarist, play, both, parts, to, the, degree, that, this, is, possible, in, funk, bands, guitarists, typically, play, in, a, percussive, style, using, a, style, of, picking, called, the, chank, or, chicken, scratch, in, which, the, guitar, strings, are, pressed, lightly, against, the, fingerboard, and, then, quickly, released, just, enough, to, get, a, muted, scratching, sound, that, is, produced, by, rapid, rhythmic, strumming, of, the, opposite, hand, near, the, bridge, earliest, examples, of, that, technic, used, on, rhythm, and, blues, is, listened, on, johnny, otis, song, willie, and, the, hand, jive, in, 1957, with, the, future, james, brown, band, guitar, player, jimmy, nolen, the, technique, can, be, broken, down, into, three, approaches, the, chika, the, chank, and, the, choke, with, the, chika, comes, a, muted, sound, of, strings, being, hit, against, the, fingerboard, chank, is, a, staccato, attack, done, by, releasing, the, chord, with, the, fretting, hand, after, strumming, it, and, choking, generally, uses, all, the, strings, being, strummed, and, heavily, muted, the, result, of, these, factors, was, a, rhythm, guitar, sound, that, seemed, to, float, somewhere, between, the, low, end, thump, of, the, electric, bass, and, the, cutting, tone, of, the, snare, and, hi, hats, with, a, rhythmically, melodic, feel, that, fell, deep, in, the, pocket, guitarist, jimmy, nolen, longtime, guitarist, for, james, brown, developed, this, technique, on, brown, s, give, it, up, or, turnit, a, loose, 1969, however, jimmy, nolen, s, guitar, part, has, a, bare, bones, tonal, structure, the, pattern, of, attack, points, is, the, emphasis, not, the, pattern, of, pitches, the, guitar, is, used, the, way, that, an, african, drum, or, idiophone, would, be, used, nolen, created, a, clean, trebly, tone, by, using, hollow, body, jazz, guitars, with, single, coil, p, 90, pickups, plugged, into, a, fender, twin, reverb, amp, with, the, mid, turned, down, low, and, the, treble, turned, up, high, funk, guitarists, playing, rhythm, guitar, generally, avoid, distortion, effects, and, amp, overdrive, to, get, a, clean, sound, and, given, the, importance, of, a, crisp, high, sound, fender, stratocasters, and, telecasters, were, widely, used, for, their, cutting, treble, tone, the, mids, are, often, cut, by, guitarists, to, help, the, guitar, sound, different, from, the, horn, section, keyboards, and, other, instruments, given, the, focus, on, providing, a, rhythmic, groove, and, the, lack, of, emphasis, on, instrumental, guitar, melodies, and, guitar, solos, sustain, is, not, sought, out, by, funk, rhythm, guitarists, funk, rhythm, guitarists, use, compressor, volume, control, effects, to, enhance, the, sound, of, muted, notes, which, boosts, the, clucking, sound, and, adds, percussive, excitement, to, funk, rhythms, an, approach, used, by, nile, rodgers, guitarist, eddie, hazel, from, funkadelic, is, notable, for, his, solo, improvisation, particularly, for, the, solo, on, maggot, brain, and, guitar, riffs, the, tone, of, which, was, shaped, by, a, maestro, fz, 1, fuzz, tone, pedal, hazel, along, with, guitarist, ernie, isley, of, the, isley, brothers, was, influenced, by, jimi, hendrix, s, improvised, wah, wah, infused, solos, ernie, isley, was, tutored, at, an, early, age, by, hendrix, when, hendrix, was, a, part, of, the, isley, brothers, backing, band, and, temporarily, lived, in, the, isleys, household, funk, guitarists, use, the, wah, wah, sound, effect, along, with, muting, the, notes, to, create, a, percussive, sound, for, their, guitar, riffs, the, phaser, effect, is, often, used, in, funk, and, r, b, guitar, playing, for, its, filter, sweeping, sound, effect, an, example, being, the, isley, brothers, song, who, s, that, lady, michael, hampton, another, p, funk, guitarist, was, able, to, play, hazel, s, virtuosic, solo, on, maggot, brain, using, a, solo, approach, that, added, in, string, bends, and, hendrix, style, feedback, a, range, of, keyboard, instruments, are, used, in, funk, acoustic, piano, is, used, in, funk, including, in, september, by, earth, wind, fire, and, will, it, go, round, in, circles, by, billy, preston, the, electric, piano, is, used, on, songs, such, as, herbie, hancock, s, chameleon, a, fender, rhodes, and, mercy, mercy, mercy, by, joe, zawinul, a, wurlitzer, the, clavinet, is, used, for, its, percussive, tone, and, it, can, be, heard, in, songs, such, as, stevie, wonder, s, superstition, and, higher, ground, and, bill, withers, use, me, the, hammond, b, 3, organ, is, used, in, funk, in, songs, such, as, cissy, strut, by, the, meters, and, love, the, one, you, re, with, with, aretha, franklin, singing, and, billy, preston, on, keyboards, bernie, worrell, s, range, of, keyboards, from, his, recordings, with, parliament, funkadelic, demonstrate, the, wide, range, of, keyboards, used, in, funk, as, they, include, the, hammond, organ, funky, woman, hit, it, and, quit, it, wars, of, armageddon, rmi, electric, piano, i, wanna, know, if, it, s, good, to, you, free, your, mind, loose, booty, acoustic, piano, funky, dollar, bill, jimmy, s, got, a, little, bit, of, bitch, in, him, clavinet, joyful, process, up, for, the, down, stroke, red, hot, mama, minimoog, synthesizer, atmosphere, flash, light, aqua, boogie, knee, deep, let, s, take, it, to, the, stage, and, arp, string, ensemble, synth, chocolate, city, give, up, the, funk, tear, the, roof, off, the, sucker, undisco, kidd, synthesizers, were, used, in, funk, both, to, add, to, the, deep, sound, of, the, electric, bass, or, even, to, replace, the, electric, bass, altogether, in, some, songs, funk, synthesizer, bass, most, often, a, minimoog, was, used, because, it, could, create, layered, sounds, and, new, electronic, tones, that, were, not, feasible, on, electric, bass, in, the, 1970s, funk, used, many, of, the, same, vocal, styles, that, were, used, in, african, american, music, in, the, 1960s, including, singing, influences, from, blues, gospel, jazz, and, doo, wop, like, these, other, african, american, styles, funk, used, ells, shouts, hollers, moans, humming, and, melodic, riffs, along, with, styles, such, as, call, and, response, and, narration, of, stories, like, the, african, oral, tradition, approach, the, call, and, response, in, funk, can, be, between, the, lead, singer, and, the, band, members, who, act, as, backup, vocalists, as, funk, emerged, from, soul, the, vocals, in, funk, share, soul, s, approach, however, funk, vocals, tend, to, be, more, punctuated, energetic, rhythmically, percussive, and, less, embellished, with, ornaments, and, the, vocal, lines, tend, to, resemble, horn, parts, and, have, pushed, rhythms, funk, bands, such, as, earth, wind, fire, have, harmony, vocal, parts, songs, like, super, bad, by, james, brown, included, double, voice, along, with, yells, shouts, and, screams, funk, singers, used, a, black, aesthetic, to, perform, that, made, use, of, colorful, and, lively, exchange, of, gestures, facial, expressions, body, posture, and, vocal, phrases, to, create, an, engaging, performance, the, lyrics, in, funk, music, addressed, issues, faced, by, the, african, american, community, in, the, united, states, during, the, 1970s, which, arose, due, to, the, move, away, from, an, industrial, working, class, economy, to, an, information, economy, which, harmed, the, black, working, class, funk, songs, by, the, ohio, players, earth, wind, fire, and, james, brown, raised, issues, faced, by, lower, income, blacks, in, their, song, lyrics, such, as, poor, economic, conditions, and, themes, of, poor, inner, city, life, in, the, black, communities, the, funkadelic, song, one, nation, under, a, groove, 1978, is, about, the, challenges, that, blacks, overcame, during, the, 1960s, civil, rights, movement, and, it, includes, an, exhortation, for, blacks, in, the, 1970s, to, capitalize, on, the, new, social, and, political, opportunities, that, had, become, available, in, the, 1970s, the, isley, brothers, song, fight, the, power, 1975, has, a, political, message, parliament, s, song, chocolate, city, 1975, metaphorically, refers, to, washington, d, c, and, other, us, cities, that, have, a, mainly, black, population, and, it, draws, attention, to, the, potential, power, that, black, voters, wield, and, suggests, that, a, black, president, be, considered, in, the, future, the, political, themes, of, funk, songs, and, the, aiming, of, the, messages, to, a, black, audience, echoed, the, new, image, of, blacks, that, was, created, in, blaxploitation, films, which, depicted, african, american, men, and, women, standing, their, ground, and, fighting, for, what, was, right, both, funk, and, blaxploitation, films, addressed, issues, faced, by, blacks, and, told, stories, from, a, black, perspective, another, link, between, 1970s, funk, and, blaxploitation, films, is, that, many, of, these, films, used, funk, soundtracks, e, g, curtis, mayfield, for, superfly, james, brown, and, fred, wesley, for, black, caesar, and, war, for, youngblood, funk, songs, included, metaphorical, language, that, was, understood, best, by, listeners, who, were, familiar, with, the, black, aesthetic, and, vernacular, for, example, funk, songs, included, expressions, such, as, shake, your, money,

james, brown, had, developed, his, signature, groove, that, emphasized, the, downbeat, with, heavy, emphasis, on, the, first, beat, of, every, measure, to, etch, his, distinctive, sound, rather, than, the, backbeat, that, typified, african, american, music, brown, often, cued, his, band, with, the, command, on, the, one, changing, the, percussion, emphasis, accent, from, the, one, two, three, four, backbeat, of, traditional, soul, music, to, the, one, two, three, four, downbeat, but, with, an, even, note, syncopated, guitar, rhythm, on, quarter, notes, two, and, four, featuring, a, hard, driving, repetitive, brassy, swing, this, one, three, beat, launched, the, shift, in, brown, s, signature, music, style, starting, with, his, 1964, hit, single, out, of, sight, and, his, 1965, hits, papa, s, got, a, brand, new, bag, and, i, got, you, i, feel, good, brown, s, style, of, funk, was, based, on, interlocking, contrapuntal, parts, syncopated, basslines, 16th, beat, drum, patterns, and,

stripped, down, to, its, rhythmic, essence, on, ain, t, it, funky, the, tonal, structure, is, barebones, brown, s, innovations, led, to, him, and, his, band, becoming, the, seminal, funk, act, they, also, pushed, the, funk, music, style, further, to, the, forefront, with, releases, such, as, cold, sweat, 1967, mother, popcorn, 1969, and, get, up, i, feel, like, being, a, sex, machine, 1970, discarding, even, the, twelve, bar, blues, featured, in, his, earlier, music, instead, brown, s, music, was, overlaid, with, catchy, anthemic, vocals, based, on, extensive, vamps, in, which, he, also, used, his, voice, as, a, percussive, instrument, with, frequent, rhythmic, grunts, and, with, rhythm, section, patterns, west, african, polyrhythms, a, tradition, evident, in, african, american, work, songs, and, chants, throughout, his, career, brown, s, frenzied, vocals, frequently, punctuated, with, screams, and, grunts, channeled, the, ecstatic, ambiance, of, the, black, church, in, a, secular,

modern, funk, if, in, a, studio, you, said, play, it, funky, that, could, imply, almost, anything, but, give, me, a, new, orleans, beat, you, got, exactly, what, you, wanted, and, clyde, stubblefield, was, just, the, epitome, of, this, funky, drumming, stewart, states, that, the, popular, feel, was, passed, along, from, new, orleans, through, james, brown, s, music, to, the, popular, music, of, the, 1970s, concerning, the, various, funk, motifs, stewart, states, that, this, model, is, different, from, a, time, line, such, as, clave, and, tresillo, in, that, it, is, not, an, exact, pattern,

simple, as, that, really, according, to, maceo, parker, brown, s, former, saxophonist, playing, on, the, downbeat, was, at, first, hard, for, him, and, took, some, getting, used, to, reflecting, back, to, his, early, days, with, brown, s, band, parker, reported, that, he, had, difficulty, playing, on, the, one, during, solo, performances, since, he, was, used, to, hearing, and, playing, with, the,

referred, to, collectively, as, parliament, funkadelic, the, breakout, popularity, of, parliament, funkadelic, gave, rise, to, the, term, p, funk, which, referred, to, the, music, by, george, clinton,

genre, is, juxtaposed, with, the, traditional, view, of, funk, as, a, male, centered, genre, valnes, acknowledges, that, funk, is, male, dominated, but, provides, insight, to, the, societal, circumstances, that, led, to, this, situation, mon, e, s, influences, include, her, mentor, prince, funkadelic, lauryn, hill, and, other, funk, and, r, b, artists, but, according, to, emily, lordi, davis, is, seldom, listed, among, janelle, mon, e, s, many, influences, and, certainly, the, younger, singer, s, high, tech, concepts, virtuosic, performances, and, meticulously, produced, songs, are, far, removed, from, davis, s, proto, punk, aesthetic, but, like, davis, she, also, is, closely, linked, with, a, visionary, male, mentor, prince, the, title, of, mon, e, s, 2013, album, the, electric, lady, alludes, to, hendrix, s, electric, ladyland, but, it, also, implicitly, cites, the, coterie, of, women, that, inspired, hendrix, himself, that, group, called, the, cosmic, ladies, or, electric,
