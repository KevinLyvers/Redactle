also, provided, it, with, her, foreword, she, addressed, the, faulty, punctuation, and, orthography, but, also, diluted, joseph, s, thick, yorkshire, dialect, writing, to, her, publisher, w, s, williams, she, said, that, it, seems, to, me, advisable, to, modify, the, orthography, of, the, old, servant, joseph, s, speeches, for, though, as, it, stands, it, exactly, renders, the, yorkshire, dialect, to, a, yorkshire, ear, yet, i, am, sure, southerns, must, find, it, unintelligible, and, thus, one, of, the, most, graphic, characters, in, the, book, is, lost, on, them, irene, wiltshire, in, an, essay, on, dialect, and, speech, examines, some, of, the, changes, charlotte, made, early, reviews, of, wuthering, heights, were, mixed, most, critics, recognised, the, power, and, imagination, of, the, novel, but, were, baffled, by, the, storyline, and, objected, to, the, savagery, and, selfishness, of, the, characters, in, 1847, when, the, background, of, an, author, was, given, great, importance, in, literary, criticism, many, critics, were, intrigued, by, the, authorship, of, the, bell, novels, the, atlas, review, called, it, a, strange, inartistic, story, but, commented, that, every, chapter, seems, to, contain, a, sort, of, rugged, power, graham, s, lady, magazine, wrote, how, a, human, being, could, have, attempted, such, a, book, as, the, present, without, committing, suicide, before, he, had, finished, a, dozen, chapters, is, a, mystery, it, is, a, compound, of, vulgar, depravity, and, unnatural, horrors, the, american, whig, review, wrote, respecting, a, book, so, original, as, this, and, written, with, so, much, power, of, imagination, it, is, natural, that, there, should, be, many, opinions, indeed, its, power, is, so, predominant, that, it, is, not, easy, after, a, hasty, reading, to, analyze, one, s, impressions, so, as, to, speak, of, its, merits, and, demerits, with, confidence, we, have, been, taken, and, carried, through, a, new, region, a, melancholy, waste, with, here, and, there, patches, of, beauty, have, been, brought, in, contact, with, fierce, passions, with, extremes, of, love, and, hate, and, with, sorrow, that, none, but, those, who, have, suffered, can, understand, douglas, jerrold, s, weekly, newspaper, wrote, wuthering, heights, is, a, strange, sort, of, book, baffling, all, regular, criticism, yet, it, is, impossible, to, begin, and, not, finish, it, and, quite, as, impossible, to, lay, it, aside, afterwards, and, say, nothing, about, in, wuthering, heights, the, reader, is, shocked, disgusted, almost, sickened, by, details, of, cruelty, inhumanity, and, the, most, diabolical, hate, and, vengeance, and, anon, come, passages, of, powerful, testimony, to, the, supreme, power, of, love, even, over, demons, in, the, human, form, the, women, in, the, book, are, of, a, strange, fiendish, angelic, nature, tantalising, and, terrible, and, the, men, are, indescribable, out, of, the, book, itself, the, examiner, wrote, this, is, a, strange, book, it, is, not, without, evidences, of, considerable, power, but, as, a, whole, it, is, wild, confused, disjointed, and, improbable, and, the, people, who, make, up, the, drama, which, is, tragic, enough, in, its, consequences, are, savages, ruder, than, those, who, lived, before, the, days, of, homer, the, literary, world, wrote, in, the, whole, story, not, a, single, trait, of, character, is, elicited, which, can, command, our, admiration, not, one, of, the, fine, feelings, of, our, nature, seems, to, have, formed, a, part, in, the, composition, of, its, principal, actors, in, spite, of, the, disgusting, coarsness, of, much, of, the, dialogue, and, the, improbabilities, of, much, of, the, plot, we, are, spellbound, the, english, poet, and, painter, dante, gabriel, rossetti, admired, the, book, writing, in, 1854, that, it, was, the, first, novel, i, ve, read, for, an, age, and, the, best, as, regards, power, and, sound, style, for, two, ages, except, sidonia, but, in, the, same, letter, he, also, referred, to, it, as, a, fiend, of, a, book, an, incredible, monster, the, action, is, laid, in, hell, only, it, seems, places, and, people, have, english, names, there, rossetti, s, friend, the, poet, algernon, charles, swinburne, was, another, early, admirer, of, the, novel, and, in, conclusion, for, an, essay, on, emily, bront, published, in, the, the, athenaeum, in, 1883, writes, as, was, the, author, s, life, so, is, her, book, in, all, things, troubled, and, taintless, with, little, of, rest, in, it, and, nothing, of, reproach, it, may, be, true, that, not, many, will, ever, take, it, to, their, hearts, it, is, certain, that, those, who, do, like, it, will, like, nothing, very, much, better, in, the, whole, world, of, poetry, or, prose, until, late, in, the, 19th, century, jane, eyre, was, regarded, as, the, best, of, the, bront, sisters, novels, this, view, began, to, change, in, the, 1880s, with, the, publication, of, a, mary, f, robinson, s, biography, of, emily, in, 1883, modernist, novelist, virginia, woolf, affirmed, the, greatness, of, wuthering, heights, in, 1925, wuthering, heights, is, a, more, difficult, book, to, understand, than, jane, eyre, because, emily, was, a, greater, poet, than, charlotte, she, looked, out, upon, a, world, cleft, into, gigantic, disorder, and, felt, within, her, the, power, to, unite, it, in, a, book, that, gigantic, ambition, is, to, be, felt, throughout, the, novel, it, is, this, suggestion, of, power, underlying, the, apparitions, of, human, nature, and, lifting, them, up, into, the, presence, of, greatness, that, gives, the, book, its, huge, stature, among, other, novels, similarly, woolf, s, contemporary, john, cowper, powys, referred, in, 1916, to, emily, bront, s, tremendous, vision, in, 1926, charles, percy, sanger, s, work, on, the, chronology, of, wuthering, heights, affirmed, emily, s, literary, craft, and, meticulous, planning, of, the, novel, and, disproved, charlotte, s, presentation, of, her, sister, as, an, unconscious, artist, who, did, not, know, what, she, had, done, however, for, a, later, critic, albert, j, guerard, it, is, a, splendid, imperfect, novel, which, bront, loses, control, over, occasionally, still, in, 1934, lord, david, cecil, writing, in, early, victorian, novelists, commented, that, emily, bront, was, not, properly, appreciated, even, her, admirers, saw, her, as, an, unequal, genius, and, in, 1948, f, r, leavis, excluded, wuthering, heights, from, the, great, tradition, of, the, english, novel, because, it, was, a, kind, of, sport, an, anomaly, with, some, influence, of, an, essentially, undetectable, kind, the, novelist, daphne, du, maurier, argued, the, status, of, wuthering, heights, as, a, supreme, romantic, novel, in, 1971, there, is, more, savagery, more, brutality, in, the, pages, of, wuthering, heights, than, in, any, novel, of, the, nineteenth, century, and, for, good, measure, more, beauty, too, more, poetry, and, what, is, more, unusual, a, complete, lack, of, sexual, emotion, emily, bront, striding, over, the, yorkshire, moors, with, her, dog, did, not, conjure, from, her, imagination, any, cozy, tale, of, happy, lovers, to, console, women, readers, sitting, snugly, within, doors, writing, in, the, guardian, in, 2003, writer, and, editor, robert, mccrum, placed, wuthering, heights, in, his, list, of, 100, greatest, novels, of, all, time, and, in, 2015, he, placed, it, in, his, list, of, 100, best, novels, written, in, english, he, said, that, wuthering, heights, releases, extraordinary, new, energies, in, the, novel, renews, its, potential, and, almost, reinvents, the, genre, the, scope, and, drift, of, its, imagination, its, passionate, exploration, of, a, fatal, yet, regenerative, love, affair, and, its, brilliant, manipulation, of, time, and, space, put, it, in, a, league, of, its, own, writing, for, bbc, culture, in, 2015, author, and, book, reviewer, jane, ciabattari, polled, 82, book, critics, from, outside, the, uk, and, presented, wuthering, heights, as, number, 7, in, the, resulting, list, of, 100, greatest, british, novels, in, 2018, penguin, presented, a, list, of, 100, must, read, classic, books, and, placed, wuthering, heights, at, number, 71, saying, widely, considered, a, staple, of, gothic, fiction, and, the, english, literary, canon, this, book, has, gone, on, to, inspire, many, generations, of, writers, and, will, continue, to, do, so, writing, in, the, independent, journalist, and, author, ceri, radford, and, news, presenter, journalist, and, tv, producer, chris, harvey, included, wuthering, heights, in, a, list, of, the, 40, best, books, to, read, during, lockdown, harvey, said, that, it, s, impossible, to, imagine, this, novel, ever, provoking, quiet, slumbers, emily, bront, s, vision, of, nature, blazes, with, poetry, novelist, john, cowper, powys, notes, the, importance, of, the, setting, by, that, singular, and, forlorn, scenery, the, scenery, of, the, yorkshire, moors, round, her, home, was, however, in, the, more, flexible, portion, of, her, curious, nature, inveterately, influenced, she, does, not, precisely, describe, this, scenery, not, at, any, length, but, it, sank, so, deeply, into, her, that, whatever, she, wrote, was, affected, by, it, and, bears, its, desolate, and, imaginative, imprint, likewise, virginia, woolf, suggests, the, importance, of, the, yorkshire, landscape, of, haworth, to, the, poetic, vision, of, both, emily, and, charlotte, bront, if, they, choose, to, write, in, prose, intolerant, of, its, restrictions, hence, it, is, that, both, emily, and, charlotte, are, always, invoking, the, help, of, nature, they, both, feel, the, need, of, some, more, powerful, symbol, of, the, vast, and, slumbering, passions, in, human, nature, than, words, or, actions, can, convey, they, seized, those, aspects, of, the, earth, which, were, most, akin, to, what, they, themselves, felt, or, imputed, to, their, characters, and, so, their, storms, their, moors, their, lovely, spaces, of, summer, weather, are, not, ornaments, applied, to, decorate, a, dull, page, or, display, the, writer, s, powers, of, observation, they, carry, on, the, emotion, and, light, up, the, meaning, of, the, book, wuthering, heights, is, an, old, house, high, on, the, pennine, moorland, of, west, yorkshire, the, first, description, is, provided, by, lockwood, the, new, tenant, of, the, nearby, thrushcross, grange, wuthering, heights, is, the, name, of, mr, heathcliff, s, dwelling, wuthering, being, a, significant, provincial, adjective, descriptive, of, the, atmospheric, tumult, to, which, its, station, is, exposed, in, stormy, weather, pure, bracing, ventilation, they, must, have, up, there, at, all, times, indeed, one, may, guess, the, power, of, the, north, wind, blowing, over, the, edge, by, the, excessive, slant, of, a, few, stunted, firs, at, the, end, of, the, house, and, by, a, range, of, gaunt, thorns, all, stretching, their, limbs, one, way, as, if, craving, alms, of, the, sun, lord, david, cecil, in, early, victorian, novelists, 1934, drew, attention, to, the, contrast, between, the, two, main, settings, in, wuthering, heights, we, have, wuthering, heights, the, land, of, storm, high, on, the, barren, moorland, naked, to, the, shock, of, the, elements, the, natural, home, of, the, earnshaw, family, fiery, untamed, children, of, the, storm, on, the, other, hand, sheltered, in, the, leafy, valley, below, stands, thrushcross, grange, the, appropriate, home, of, the, children, of, calm, the, gentle, passive, timid, lintons, walter, allen, in, the, english, novel, 1954, likewise, spoke, of, the, two, houses, in, the, novel, as, symbolising, two, opposed, principles, which, ultimately, compose, a, harmony, however, david, daiches, in, the, 1965, penguin, english, library, edition, referred, to, cecil, s, interpretation, as, being, persuasively, argued, though, not, fully, acceptable, the, entry, on, wuthering, heights, in, the, 2002, oxford, companion, to, english, literature, states, that, the, ending, of, the, novel, points, to, a, union, of, the, two, contrasting, worlds, and, moral, orders, represented, by, the, heights, and, the, grange, there, is, no, evidence, that, either, thrushcross, grange, or, wuthering, heights, is, based, on, an, actual, building, but, various, locations, have, been, speculated, as, inspirations, top, withens, a, ruined, farmhouse, in, an, isolated, area, near, the, haworth, parsonage, was, suggested, as, the, model, for, wuthering, heights, by, ellen, nussey, a, friend, of, charlotte, bront, however, its, structure, does, not, match, that, of, the, farmhouse, described, in, the, novel, high, sunderland, hall, near, law, hill, halifax, where, emily, worked, briefly, as, a, governess, in, 1838, now, demolished, has, also, been, suggested, as, a, model, for, wuthering, heights, however, it, is, too, grand, for, a, farmhouse, ponden, hall, is, famous, for, reputedly, being, the, inspiration, for, thrushcross, grange, since, bront, was, a, frequent, visitor, however, it, does, not, match, the, description, given, in, the, novel, and, is, closer, in, size, and, appearance, to, the, farmhouse, of, wuthering, heights, the, bront, biographer, winifred, gerin, believed, that, ponden, hall, was, the, original, of, wildfell, hall, the, old, mansion, in, anne, bront, s, the, tenant, of, wildfell, hall, helen, smart, while, noting, that, thrushcross, grange, has, traditionally, been, associated, with, ponden, hall, stanbury, near, haworth, sees, shibden, hall, northowram, in, halifax, parish, as, more, likely, referring, to, hilda, marsden, s, article, the, scenic, background, of, wuthering, heights, most, of, the, novel, is, the, story, told, by, housekeeper, nelly, dean, to, lockwood, though, the, novel, uses, several, narrators, in, fact, five, or, six, to, place, the, story, in, perspective, or, in, a, variety, of, perspectives, emily, bront, uses, this, frame, story, technique, to, narrate, most, of, the, story, thus, for, example, lockwood, the, first, narrator, of, the, story, tells, the, story, of, nelly, who, herself, tells, the, story, of, another, character, the, use, of, a, character, like, nelly, dean, is, a, literary, device, a, well, known, convention, taken, from, the, gothic, novel, the, function, of, which, is, to, portray, the, events, in, a, more, mysterious, and, exciting, manner, thus, the, point, of, view, comes, from, a, combination, of, two, speakers, who, outline, the, events, of, the, plot, within, the, framework, of, a, story, within, a, story, the, frame, story, is, that, of, lockwood, who, informs, us, of, his, meeting, with, the, strange, and, mysterious, family, living, in, almost, total, isolation, in, the, stony, uncultivated, land, of, northern, england, the, inner, story, is, that, of, nelly, dean, who, transmits, to, lockwood, the, history, of, the, two, families, during, the, last, two, generations, nelly, dean, examines, the, events, retrospectively, and, attempts, to, report, them, as, an, objective, eyewitness, to, lockwood, critics, have, questioned, the, reliability, of, the, two, main, narrators, the, author, has, been, described, as, sarcastic, toward, lockwood, who, fancies, himself, a, world, weary, romantic, but, comes, across, as, an, effete, snob, and, there, are, subtler, hints, that, nelly, s, perspective, is, influenced, by, her, own, biases, the, narrative, in, addition, includes, an, excerpt, from, catherine, earnshaw, s, old, diary, and, short, sections, narrated, by, heathcliff, isabella, and, another, servant, bront, possessed, an, exceptional, education, of, classical, culture, for, a, woman, of, the, time, she, was, familiar, with, greek, tragedies, and, was, a, good, latinist, in, addition, she, was, especially, influenced, by, the, poets, john, milton, and, william, shakespeare, there, are, echoes, of, and, allusions, to, shakespeare, s, tragedies, king, lear, romeo, and, juliet, macbeth, and, hamlet, in, wuthering, heights, another, major, source, of, information, for, the, bront, s, was, the, periodicals, that, their, father, read, the, leeds, intelligencer, and, blackwood, s, edinburgh, magazine, blackwood, s, magazine, provided, knowledge, of, world, affairs, and, was, a, source, of, material, for, the, bront, s, early, writing, emily, bront, was, probably, aware, of, the, debate, on, evolution, this, debate, had, been, launched, in, 1844, by, robert, chambers, it, raised, questions, of, divine, providence, and, the, violence, which, underlies, the, universe, and, relationships, between, living, things, romanticism, was, also, a, major, influence, which, included, the, gothic, novel, the, novels, of, walter, scott, and, the, poetry, of, byron, the, bront, s, fiction, is, seen, by, some, feminist, critics, as, prime, examples, of, female, gothic, it, explores, the, domestic, entrapment, and, subjection, of, women, to, patriarchal, authority, and, the, attempts, to, subvert, and, escape, such, restriction, emily, bront, s, cathy, earnshaw, and, charlotte, bront, s, jane, eyre, are, both, examples, of, female, protagonists, in, such, a, role, according, to, juliet, barker, walter, scott, s, novel, rob, roy, 1817, had, a, significant, influence, on, wuthering, heights, which, though, regarded, as, the, archetypal, yorkshire, novel,

incidents, scott, distinguished, the, romance, from, the, novel, where, as, he, saw, it, events, are, accommodated, to, the, ordinary, train, of, human, events, and, the, modern, state, of, society, scott, describes, romance, as, a, kindred, term, to, novel, however, romances, such, as, wuthering, heights, and, scott, s, own, historical, romances, and, herman, melville, s, moby, dick, are, often, referred, to, as, novels, other, european, languages, do, not, distinguish, between, romance, and, novel, a, novel, is, le, roman, der, roman, il, romanzo, en, roman, this, sort, of, romance, is,

by, the, gothic, novel, horace, walpole, s, the, castle, of, otranto, 1764, is, usually, considered, the, first, gothic, novel, walpole, s, declared, aim, was, to, combine, elements, of, the, medieval, romance, which, he, deemed, too, fanciful, and, the, modern, novel, which, he, considered, to, be, too, confined, to, strict, realism, more, recently, ellen, moers, in, literary, women, developed, a, feminist, theory, that, connects, female, writers, such, as, emily, bront, with, gothic, fiction, catherine, earnshaw, has, been, identified, by, some, critics, as, a, type, of, gothic, demon, because, she, shape, shifts, in, order, to, marry, edgar, linton, assuming, a, domesticity, that, is, contrary, to, her, true, nature, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, catherine, s, relationship, with, heathcliff, conforms, to, the, dynamics, of, the, gothic, romance, in, that, the, woman, falls, prey, to, the, more, or, less, demonic, instincts, of, her, lover, suffers, from, the, violence, of, his, feelings, and, at, the, end, is, entangled, by, his, thwarted, passion, see, also, the, discussion, of, the, daemonic, below, under, religion, at, one, point, in, the, novel, heathcliff, is, thought, a, vampire, it, has, been, suggested, that, both, he, and, catherine, are, in, fact, meant, to, be, seen, as, vampire, like, personalities, some, early, victorian, reviewers, complained, about, how, wuthering, heights, dealt, with, violence, and, immorality, one, called, it, a, compound, of, vulgar, depravity, and, unnatural, horrors, bront, was, supposedly, unaware, of, the, limits, on, polite, expression, expected, of, victorian, novelists, her, characters, use, vulgar, language, cursing, and, swearing, though, the, daughter, of, a, curate, bront, shows, little, respect, for, religion, in, the, novel, the, only, strongly, religious, character, in, wuthering, heights, is, joseph, who, is, usually, seen, as, satirizing, the, joyless, version, of, methodism, that, the, bront, children, were, exposed, to, through, their, aunt, branwell, a, major, influence, on, how, bront, depicts, amoral, characters, was, the, stories, her, father, patrick, bront, told, about, the, doings, of, people, around, haworth, that, his, parishioners, told, him, stories, which, made, one, shiver, and, shrink, from, hearing, charlotte, s, friend, ellen, nussey, reported, which, were, full, of, grim, humour, and, violence, stories, emily, bront, took, as, a, truth, shortly, after, emily, bront, s, death, g, h, lewes, wrote, in, leader, magazine, curious, enough, is, to, read, wuthering, heights, and, the, tenant, of, wildfell, hall, and, remember, that, the, writers, were, two, retiring, solitary, consumptive, girls, books, coarse, even, for, men, coarse, in, language, and, coarse, in, conception, the, coarseness, apparently, of, violence, and, uncultivated, men, turn, out, to, be, the, productions, of, two, girls, living, almost, alone, filling, their, loneliness, with, quiet, studies, and, writing, their, books, from, a, sense, of, duty, hating, the, pictures, they, drew, yet, drawing, them, with, austere, conscientiousness, there, is, matter, here, for, the, moralist, or, critic, to, speculate, on, emily, bront, attended, church, regularly, and, came, from, a, religious, family, emily, never, as, far, as, we, know, wrote, anything, which, overtly, criticised, conventional, religion, but, she, also, has, the, reputation, of, being, a, rebel, and, iconoclast, driven, by, a, spirit, more, pagan, than, orthodox, christian, derek, traversi, for, example, sees, in, wuthering, heights, a, thirst, for, religious, experience, which, is, not, christian, it, is, this, spirit, which, moves, catherine, to, exclaim, surely, you, and, everybody, have, a, notion, that, there, is, or, should, be, an, existence, of, yours, beyond, you, what, were, the, use, of, my, creation, if, i, were, entirely, contained, here, ch, ix, thomas, john, winnifrith, author, of, the, brontes, and, their, background, romance, and, reality, macmillan, 1977, argues, that, the, allusions, to, heaven, and, hell, are, more, than, metaphors, and, have, a, religious, significance, because, for, heathcliff, the, loss, of, catherine, is, literally, hell, existence, after, losing, her, would, be, hell, ch, xiv, p, 117, likewise, in, the, final, scene, between, them, heathcliff, writhes, in, the, torments, of, hell, xv, the, eminent, german, lutheran, theologian, and, philosopher, rudolph, otto, author, of, the, idea, of, the, holy, saw, in, wuthering, heights, a, supreme, example, of, the, daemonic, in, literature, otto, links, the, daemonic, with, a, genuine, religious, experience, lisa, wang, argues, that, in, both, wuthering, heights, and, in, her, poetry, emily, bront, concentrates, on, the, non, conceptual, or, what, rudolf, otto, has, called, the, non, rational, aspect, of, religion, the, primal, nature, of, religious, experience, over, and, above, its, doctrinal, formulations, this, corresponds, with, the, dictionary, meaning, of, or, relating, to, an, inner, or, attendant, spirit, esp, as, a, source, of, creative, inspiration, or, genius, this, meaning, was, important, to, the, romantic, movement, however, the, word, daemon, can, also, mean, a, demon, or, devil, and, that, is, equally, relevant, to, heathcliff, whom, peter, mcinerney, describes, as, a, satanic, don, juan, heathcliff, is, also, dark, skinned, as, dark, almost, as, if, it, came, from, the, devil, likewise, charlotte, bront, described, him, a, man, s, shape, animated, by, demon, life, a, ghoul, an, afreet, in, arabian, mythology, an, afreet, or, ifrit, is, a, powerful, jinn, or, demon, however, john, bowen, believes, that, this, is, too, simple, a, view, because, the, novel, presents, an, alternative, explanation, of, heathcliff, s, cruel, and, sadistic, behaviour, that, is, that, he, has, suffered, terribly, is, an, orphan, is, brutalised, by, hindley, relegated, to, the, status, of, a, servant, catherine, marries, edgar, one, 2007, british, poll, presented, wuthering, heights, as, the, greatest, love, story, of, all, time, however, some, of, the, novel, s, admirers, consider, it, not, a, love, story, at, all, but, an, exploration, of, evil, and, abuse, helen, small, sees, wuthering, heights, as, being, both, one, of, the, greatest, love, stories, in, the, english, language, and, at, the, same, time, one, of, the, most, brutal, revenge, narratives, some, critics, suggest, that, reading, wuthering, heights, as, a, love, story, not, only, romanticizes, abusive, men, and, toxic, relationships, but, goes, against, bront, s, clear, intent, moreover, while, a, passionate, doomed, death, transcending, relationship, between, heathcliff, and, catherine, earnshaw, linton, forms, the, core, of, the, novel, wuthering, heights, consistently, subverts, the, romantic, narrative, our, first, encounter, with, heathcliff, shows, him, to, be, a, nasty, bully, later, bront, puts, in, heathcliff, s, mouth, an, explicit, warning, not, to, turn, him, into, a, byronic, hero, after, isabella, elop, with, him, he, sneers, that, she, did, so, under, a, delusion, picturing, in, me, a, hero, of, romance, i, am, heathcliff, is, a, frequently, quoted, phrase, from, the, novel, and, the, idea, of, perfect, unity, between, the, self, and, the, other, is, age, old, so, that, catherine, says, that, she, loves, heathcliff, because, he, s, more, myself, than, i, am, whatever, our, souls, are, made, of, his, and, mine, are, the, same, chapter, ix, likewise, lord, david, cecil, suggests, that, the, deepest, attachments, are, based, on, characters, similarity, or, affinity, however, simone, de, beauvoir, in, her, famous, feminist, work, the, second, sex, 1949, suggests, that, when, catherine, says, i, am, heathcliff, her, own, world, collapse, s, in, contingence, for, she, really, lives, in, his, beauvoir, sees, this, as, the, fatal, mirage, of, the, ideal, of, romantic, love, transcendence, in, the, superior, male, who, is, perceived, as, free, despite, all, the, passion, between, catherine, and, heathcliff, critics, have, from, early, on, drawn, attention, to, the, absence, of, sex, in, 1850, the, poet, and, critic, sydney, dobell, suggests, that, we, dare, not, doubt, purity, and, the, victorian, poet, swinburne, concurs, referring, to, their, passionate, and, ardent, chastity, more, recently, terry, eagleton, suggests, their, relationship, is, sexless, because, the, two, unknown, to, themselves, are, half, siblings, with, an, unconscious, fear, of, incest, childhood, is, a, central, theme, of, wuthering, heights, emily, bront, understands, that, the, child, is, father, of, the, man,

this, was, the, german, bildungsroman, or, novel, of, education, such, as, charlotte, bront, s, jane, eyre, 1847, eliot, s, the, mill, on, the, floss, 1860, and, dickens, s, great, expectations, 1861, bronte, s, characters, are, heavily, influenced, by, their, childhood, experiences, though, she, is, less, optimistic, than, her, contemporaries, that, suffering, can, lead, to, change, and, renewal, lockwood, arrives, at, thrushcross, grange, in, 1801, a, time, when, according, to, q, d, leavis, the, old, rough, farming, culture, based, on, a, naturally, patriarchal, family, life, was, to, be, challenged, tamed, and, routed, by, social, and, cultural, changes, at, this, date, the, industrial, revolution, was, well, under, way, and, was, by, 1847, a, dominant, force, in, much, of, england, and, especially, in, west, yorkshire, this, caused, a, disruption, in, the, traditional, relationship, of, social, classes, with, an, expanding, upwardly, mobile, middle, class, which, created, a, new, standard, for, defining, a, gentleman, and, challenged, the, traditional, criteria, of, breeding, and, family, and, the, more, recent, criterion, of, character, marxist, critic, arnold, kettle, sees, wuthering, heights, as, a, symbolic, representation, of, the, class, system, of, 19th, century, england, with, its, concerns, with, property, ownership, the, attraction, of, social, comforts, marriage, education, religion, and, social, status, driven, by, a, pathological, hatred, heathcliff, uses, against, his, enemies, their, own, weapons, of, money, and, arranged, marriages, as, well, as, the, classic, methods, of, the, ruling, class, expropriation, and, property, deals, later, another, marxist, terry, eagleton, in, myths, of, power, a, marxist, study, of, the, bront, s, london, mcmillan, 1975, further, explores, the, power, relationships, between, the, landed, gentry, and, aristocracy, the, traditional, power, holders, and, the, capitalist, industrial, middle, classes, haworth, in, the, west, riding, of, yorkshire, was, especially, affected, by, changes, to, society, and, its, class, structure, because, of, the, concentration, of, large, estates, and, industrial, centers, there, there, has, been, debate, about, heathcliff, s, race, or, ethnicity, he, is, described, as, a, dark, skinned, gypsy, and, a, little, lascar, a, 19th, century, term, for, indian, sailors, mr, earnshaw, calls, him, as, dark, almost, as, if, it, came, from, the, devil, and, nelly, dean, speculates, fancifully, regarding, his, origins, thus, who, knows, but, your, father, was, emperor, of, china, and, your, mother, an, indian, queen, caryl, phillips, suggests, that, heathcliff, may, have, been, an, escaped, slave, noting, the, similarities, between, the, way, heathcliff, is, treated, and, the, way, slaves, were, treated, at, the, time, he, is, referred, to, as, it, his, name, served, him, as, both, his, christian, and, surname, and, mr, earnshaw, is, referred, to, as, his, owner, maja, lisa, von, sneidern, states, that, heathcliff, s, racial, otherness, cannot, be, a, matter, of, dispute, bront, makes, that, explicit, further, noting, that, by, 1804, liverpool, merchants, were, responsible, for, more, than, eighty, four, percent, of, the, british, transatlantic, slave, trade, michael, stewart, sees, heathcliff, s, race, as, ambiguous, and, argues, that, emily, bront, deliberately, gives, us, this, missing, hole, in, the, narrative, various, critics, have, explored, the, various, contrast, between, thrushcross, grange, and, the, wuthering, heights, farmhouse, and, their, inhabitants, lord, david, cecil, argued, for, cosmic, forces, as, the, central, impetus, and, controlling, force, in, the, novel, and, suggested, that, there, is, a, unifying, structure, underlying, wuthering, heights, two, spiritual, principles, the, principle, of, the, storm, and, the, principle, of, calm, which, he, further, argued, were, not, in, spite, of, their, apparent, opposition, in, conflict, dorothy, van, ghent, however, refers, to, a, tension, between, two, kinds, of, reality, in, the, novel, civilized, manners, and, natural, energies, the, earliest,
