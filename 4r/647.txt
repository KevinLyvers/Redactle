he, is, usually, portrayed, as, a, bearded, bishop, in, canonical, robes, in, 1087, while, the, greek, christian, inhabitants, of, myra, were, subjugated, by, the, newly, arrived, muslim, seljuq, dynasty, and, soon, after, their, greek, orthodox, church, had, been, declared, to, be, in, schism, by, the, catholic, church, 1054, ad, a, group, of, merchants, from, the, italian, city, of, bari,

the, children, which, moved, in, the, course, of, the, reformation, and, its, opposition, to, the, veneration, of, saints, in, many, countries, on, 24, and, 25, december, the, custom, of, gifting, to, children, at, christmas, was, propagated, by, martin, luther, as, an, alternative, to, the, previous, very, popular, gift, custom, on, st, nicholas, to, focus, the, interest, of, the, children, to, christ, instead, of, the, veneration, of, saints, martin, luther, first, suggested, the, christkind, as, the, bringer, of, gifts, but, nicholas, remained, popular, as, gifts, bearer, for, the, people,

the, christianization, of, germanic, europe, numerous, traditions, were, absorbed, from, yuletide, celebrations, into, modern, christmas, such, as, the, wild, hunt, frequently, attested, as, being, led, by, the, god, odin, wodan, bearing, among, many, names, the, names, j, lnir, meaning, yule, figure, and, langbar, r, meaning, long, beard, in, old, norse, wodan, s, role, during, the, yuletide, period, has, been, theorized, as, having, influenced, concepts, of, st, nicholas, and, santa, claus, in, a, variety, of, facets, including, his, long, white, beard, and, his, gray, horse, for, nightly, rides, compare, odin, s, horse, sleipnir, or, his, reindeer, in, north, american, tradition, folklorist, margaret, baker, maintains, that, the, appearance, of, santa, claus, or, father, christmas, whose, day, is, the, 25th, of, december, owes, much, to, odin, the, old, blue, hooded, cloaked, white, bearded, giftbringer, of, the, north, who, rode, the, midwinter, sky, on, his, eight, footed, steed, sleipnir, visiting, his, people, with, gifts, odin, transformed, into, father, christmas, then, santa, claus, prospered, with, st, nicholas, and, the, christchild, became, a, leading, player, on, the, christmas, stage, in, northern, europe, the, yule, goat, was, an, earlier, bearer, of, gifts, which, has, to, some, degree, become, conflated, with, santa, claus, for, instance, in, the, finnish, joulupukki, tradition, early, representations, of, the, gift, giver, from, church, history, and, folklore, especially, st, nicholas, merged, with, the, english, character, father, christmas, to, create, the, mythical, character, known, to, the, rest, of, the, english, speaking, world, as, santa, claus, a, phonetic, derivation, of, sinterklaas, in, dutch, in, the, english, and, later, british, colonies, of, north, america, and, later, in, the, united, states, british, and, dutch, versions, of, the, gift, giver, merged, further, for, example, in, washington, irving, s, history, of, new, york, 1809, sinterklaas, was, anglicized, into, santa, claus, a, name, first, used, in, the, u, s, press, in, 1773, but, lost, his, bishop, s, apparel, and, was, at, first, pictured, as, a, thick, bellied, dutch, sailor, with, a, pipe, in, a, green, winter, coat, irving, s, book, was, a, parody, of, the, dutch, culture, of, new, york, and, much, of, this, portrait, is, his, joking, invention, irving, s, interpretation, of, santa, claus, was, part, of, a, broader, movement, to, tone, down, the, increasingly, wild, christmas, celebrations, of, the, era, which, included, aggressive, home, invasions, under, the, guise, of, wassailing, substantial, premarital, sex, leading, to, shotgun, weddings, in, areas, where, the, puritans, waning, in, power, and, firmly, opposed, to, christmas, still, held, some, influence, and, public, displays, of, sexual, deviancy, the, celebrations, of, the, era, were, derided, by, both, upper, class, merchants, and, christian, purists, in, 1821, the, book, a, new, year, s, present, to, the, little, ones, from, five, to, twelve, was, published, in, new, york, it, contained, old, santeclaus, with, much, delight, an, anonymous, poem, describing, santeclaus, on, a, reindeer, sleigh, bringing, rewards, to, children, some, modern, ideas, of, santa, claus, seemingly, became, canon, after, the, anonymous, publication, of, the, poem, a, visit, from, st, nicholas, better, known, today, as, the, night, before, christmas, in, the, troy, new, york, sentinel, on, 23, december, 1823, clement, clarke, moore, later, claimed, authorship, though, some, scholars, argue, that, henry, livingston, jr, who, died, nine, years, before, moore, s, claim, was, the, author, st, nick, is, described, as, being, chubby, and, plump, a, right, jolly, old, elf, with, a, little, round, belly, that, shook, when, he, laughed, like, a, bowlful, of, jelly, in, spite, of, which, the, miniature, sleigh, and, tiny, reindeer, still, indicate, that, he, is, physically, diminutive, the, reindeer, were, also, named, dasher, dancer, prancer, vixen, comet, cupid, dunder, and, blixem, dunder, and, blixem, came, from, the, old, dutch, words, for, thunder, and, lightning, which, were, later, changed, to, the, more, german, sounding, donner, and, blitzen, by, 1845, kris, kringle, was, a, common, variant, of, santa, in, parts, of, the, united, states, a, magazine, article, from, 1853, describing, american, christmas, customs, to, british, readers, refers, to, children, hanging, up, their, stockings, on, christmas, eve, for, a, fabulous, personage, whose, name, varies, in, pennsylvania, he, is, usually, called, krishkinkle, but, in, new, york, he, is, st, nicholas, or, santa, claus, the, author, quotes, moore, s, poem, in, its, entirety, saying, that, its, descriptions, apply, to, krishkinkle, too, as, the, years, passed, santa, claus, evolved, into, a, large, heavyset, person, one, of, the, first, artists, to, define, santa, claus, s, modern, image, was, thomas, nast, a, german, born, american, cartoonist, of, the, 19th, century, who, immortalized, santa, claus, with, an, illustration, for, the, 3, january, 1863, issue, of, harper, s, weekly, in, which, santa, was, dressed, in, an, american, flag, and, had, a, puppet, with, the, name, jeff, written, on, it, reflecting, its, civil, war, context, nast, was, inspired, by, the, belsnickel, part, of, the, folklure, in, southwestern, germany, where, he, was, born, in, this, drawing, santa, is, also, in, a, sleigh, pulled, by, reindeers, the, story, that, santa, claus, lives,

of, a, wife, for, santa, claus, may, have, been, the, creation, of, american, authors, beginning, in, the, mid, 19th, century, in, 1889, the, poet, katharine, lee, bates, popularized, mrs, claus, in, the, poem, goody, santa, claus, on, a, sleigh, ride, is, there, a, santa, claus, is, the, title, of, an, iconic, editorial, by, francis, pharcellus, church, in, the, 21, september, 1897, edition, of,

of, puck, magazine, in, the, first, few, years, of, the, 20th, century, the, image, of, santa, claus, as, a, benevolent, character, became, reinforced, with, its, association, with, charity, and,

makes, similar, points, noting, that, the, original, figure, of, st, nicholas, gave, only, to, those, who, were, needy, and, that, today, santa, claus, seems, to, be, more, about, conspicuous, consumption, he, mirrors, some, of, our, highest, ideals, childhood, purity, and, innocence, selfless, giving, unfaltering, love, justice, and, mercy, the, problem, is, that, in, the, process, he, has, become, burdened, with, some, of, society, s, greatest, challenges, materialism, corporate, greed, and, domination, by, the, media, in, the, czech, republic, a, group, of, advertising,

s, state, of, ohio, prohibits, the, usage, of, santa, claus, or, his, image, to, sell, alcoholic, beverages, psychologists, generally, differentiate, between, telling, fictional, stories, that, feature, santa, claus, and, actively, deceiving, a, child, into, believing, that, santa, claus, is, real, imaginative, play, in, which, children, know, that, santa, claus, is, only, a, character, in, a, story, but, pretend, that, he, is, real, just, like, they, pretend, that, superheroes, or, other, fictional, characters, are, real, is, valuable, actively, deceiving, a, child, into, believing, in, santa, claus, s, real, world, existence, sometimes, even, to, the, extent, of, fabricating, false, evidence, to, convince, them, despite, their, growing, natural, doubts, does, not, result, in, imaginative, play, and, can, promote, credulity, in, the, face, of, strong, evidence, against, santa, claus, s, existence, children, will, eventually, know, that, their, parents, deceived, them, babies, and, toddlers, do, not, understand, the, concept, of, a, fictional, character, but, most, children, become, developmentally, able, to, believe, in, santa, claus, around, age, three, or, four, the, prevalence, of, belief, in, santa, claus, is, high, at, age, five, and, declines, precipitously, when, children, are, seven, or, eight, years, old, although, the, age, at, disillusionment, has, been, fairly, stable, for, decades, in, 1978, 85, of, american, five, year, olds, believed, that, santa, was, real, but, only, 25, of, eight, year, olds, still, did, it, may, be, getting, slightly, lower, over, time, age, inappropriate, belief, in, santa, is, seen, in, some, older, children, and, teenagers, who, have, autism, or, other, neurodevelopmental, disorders, psychology, professor, jacqueline, woolley, helped, conduct, a, study, that, found, that, children, seemed, competent, in, their, use, of, logic, evidence, and, comparative, reasoning, even, though, they, might, conclude, that, santa, claus, or, other, fanciful, creatures, were, real, according, to, woolley, the, existence, of, santa, claus, is, affirmed, to, children, by, friends, books, tv, and, movies, and, by, hard, evidence, of, half, eaten, cookies, and, empty, milk, glasses, typical, objections, to, presenting, santa, claus, as, a, literally, real, person, rather, than, a, story, include, some, have, argued, that, santa, claus, prioritizes, parents, short, term, happiness, in, seeing, children, excited, about, santa, claus, and, their, nostalgic, willingness, to, prolong, the, age, of, magical, thinking, over, children, philosopher, david, kyle, johnson, wrote, it, s, a, lie, it, degrades, your, parental, trustworthiness, it, encourages, credulity, it, does, not, encourage, imagination, and, it, s, equivalent, to, bribing, your, kids, for, good, behavior, others, see, little, harm, in, the, belief, in, santa, claus, psychologist, tamar, murachver, said, that, because, it, is, a, cultural, not, parental, lie, it, does, not, usually, undermine, parental, trust, psychology, professor, jacqueline, woolley, posited, that, it, is, perhaps, kinship, with, the, adult, world, that, causes, children, not, to, be, angry, that, they, were, lied, to, for, so, long, in, one, study, it, was, found, that, children, did, not, trust, their, parents, less, and, adults, did, not, recall, an, increase, in, lack, of, trust, austin, cline, argued, the, problem, is, not, with, length, but, with, a, complicated, series, of, very, large, lies, most, children, do, not, remain, angry, or, embarrassed, about, the, deception, for, very, long, they, are, most, likely, to, have, a, positive, feeling, about, it, if, they, are, able, to, figure, it, out, logically, e, g, by, realizing, the, impossibility, of, one, person, visiting, every, home, in, a, single, night, and, gradually, according, to, psychologist, john, condry, the, most, common, response, to, finding, out, the, truth, was, that, they, felt, older, and, more, mature, they, now, knew, something, that, the, younger, kids, did, not, in, other, studies, a, small, fraction, of, children, felt, betrayed, by, their, parents, but, disappointment, was, a, more, common, response, some, children, have, reacted, strongly, including, rejecting, the, family, s, religious, beliefs, on, the, grounds, that, if, the, parents, lied, about, the, existence, of, santa, claus, then, they, might, lie, about, the, existence, of, god, as, well, the, new, zealand, skeptics, also, see, no, harm, in, parents, telling, their, children, that, santa, is, real, spokesperson, vicki, hyde, said, it, would, be, a, hard, hearted, parent, indeed, who, frowned, upon, the, innocent, joys, of, our, children, s, cultural, heritage, we, save,
