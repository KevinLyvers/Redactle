a, dictionary, is, a, listing, of, lexemes, from, the, lexicon, of, one, or, more, specific, languages, often, arranged, alphabetically, or, by, consonantal, root, for, semitic, languages, or, radical, and, stroke, for, logographic, languages, which, may, include, information, on, definitions, usage, etymologies, pronunciations, translation, etc, it, is, a, lexicographical, reference, that, shows, inter, relationships, among, the, data, a, broad, distinction, is, made, between, general, and, specialized, dictionaries, specialized, dictionaries, include, words, in, specialist, fields, rather, than, a, comprehensive, range, of, words, in, the, language, lexical, items, that, describe, concepts, in, specific, fields, are, usually, called, terms, instead, of, words, although, there, is, no, consensus, whether, lexicology, and, terminology, are, two, different, fields, of, study, in, theory, general, dictionaries, are, supposed, to, be, semasiological, mapping, word, to, definition, while, specialized, dictionaries, are, supposed, to, be, onomasiological, first, identifying, concepts, and, then, establishing, the, terms, used, to, designate, them, in, practice, the, two, approaches, are, used, for, both, types, there, are, other, types, of, dictionaries, that, do, not, fit, neatly, into, the, above, distinction, for, instance, bilingual, translation, dictionaries, dictionaries, of, synonyms, thesauri, and, rhyming, dictionaries, the, word, dictionary, unqualified, is, usually, understood, to, refer, to, a, general, purpose, monolingual,

as, unreliable, and, nowhere, near, definitive, philip, stanhope, 4th, earl, of, chesterfield, was, still, lamenting, in, 1754, 150, years, after, cawdrey, s, publication, that, it, is, a, sort, of, disgrace, to, our, nation, that, hitherto, we, have, had, no, standard, of, our, language, our, dictionaries, at, present, being, more, properly, what, our, neighbors, the, dutch, and, the, germans,

dictionaries, john, wilkins, 1668, essay, on, philosophical, language, contains, a, list, of, 11, 500, words, with, careful, distinctions, compiled, by, william, lloyd, elisha, coles, published, his, english, dictionary, in, 1676, it, was, not, until, samuel, johnson, s, a, dictionary, of, the, english, language, 1755, that, a, more, reliable, english, dictionary, was, produced, many, people, today, mistakenly, believe, that, johnson, wrote, the, first, english, dictionary, a, testimony, to, this, legacy, by, this, stage, dictionaries, had, evolved, to, contain, textual, references, for, most, words, and, were, arranged, alphabetically, rather, than, by, topic, a, previously, popular, form, of, arrangement, which, meant, all, animals, would, be, grouped, together, etc, johnson, s, masterwork, could, be, judged, as, the, first, to, bring, all, these, elements, together, creating, the, first, modern, dictionary, johnson, s, dictionary, remained, the, english, language, standard, for, over, 150, years, until, the, oxford, university, press, began, writing, and, releasing, the, oxford, english, dictionary, in, short, fascicles, from, 1884, onwards, it, took, nearly, 50, years, to, complete, this, huge, work, and, they, finally, released, the, complete, oed, in, twelve, volumes, in, 1928, one, of, the, main, contributors, to, this, modern, dictionary, was, an, ex, army, surgeon, william, chester, minor, a, convicted, murderer, who, was, confined, to, an, asylum, for, the, criminally, insane, the, oed, remains, the, most, comprehensive, and, trusted, english, language, dictionary, to, this, day, with, revisions, and, updates, added, by, a, dedicated, team, every, three, months, in, 1806, american, noah, webster, published, his, first, dictionary, a, compendious, dictionary, of, the, english, language, in, 1807, webster, began, compiling, an, expanded, and, fully, comprehensive, dictionary, an, american, dictionary, of, the, english, language, it, took, twenty, seven, years, to, complete, to, evaluate, the, etymology, of, words, webster, learned, twenty, six, languages, including, old, english, anglo, saxon, german, greek, latin, italian, spanish, french, hebrew, arabic, and, sanskrit, webster, completed, his, dictionary, during, his, year, abroad, in, 1825, in, paris, france, and, at, the, university, of, cambridge, his, book, contained, seventy, thousand, words, of, which, twelve, thousand, had, never, appeared, in, a, published, dictionary, before, as, a, spelling, reformer, webster, believed, that, english, spelling, rules, were, unnecessarily, complex, so, his, dictionary, introduced, spellings, that, became, american, english, replacing, colour, with, color, substituting, wagon, for, waggon, and, printing, center, instead, of, centre, he, also, added, american, words, like, skunk, and, squash, which, did, not, appear, in, british, dictionaries, at, the, age, of, seventy, webster, published, his, dictionary, in, 1828, it, sold, 2500, copies, in, 1840, the, second, edition, was, published, in, two, volumes, webster, s, dictionary, was, acquired, by, g, c, merriam, co, in, 1843, after, his, death, and, has, since, been, published, in, many, revised, editions, merriam, webster, was, acquired, by, encyclopedia, britannica, in, 1964, controversy, over, the, lack, of, usage, advice, in, the, 1961, webster, s, third, new, international, dictionary, spurred, publication, of, the, 1969, the, american, heritage, dictionary, of, the, english, language, the, first, dictionary, to, use, corpus, linguistics, in, a, general, dictionary, each, word, may, have, multiple, meanings, some, dictionaries, include, each, separate, meaning, in, the, order, of, most, common, usage, while, others, list, definitions, in, historical, order, with, the, oldest, usage, first, in, many, languages, words, can, appear, in, many, different, forms, but, only, the, undeclined, or, unconjugated, form, appears, as, the, headword, in, most, dictionaries, dictionaries, are, most, commonly, found, in, the, form, of, a, book, but, some, newer, dictionaries, like, stardict, and, the, new, oxford, american, dictionary, are, dictionary, software, running, on, pdas, or, computers, there, are, also, many, online, dictionaries, accessible, via, the, internet, according, to, the, manual, of, specialized, lexicographies, a, specialized, dictionary, also, referred, to, as, a, technical, dictionary, is, a, dictionary, that, focuses, upon, a, specific, subject, field, as, opposed, to, a, dictionary, that, comprehensively, contains, words, from, the, lexicon, of, a, specific, language, or, languages, following, the, description, in, the, bilingual, lsp, dictionary, lexicographers, categorize, specialized, dictionaries, into, three, types, a, multi, field, dictionary, broadly, covers, several, subject, fields, e, g, a, business, dictionary, a, single, field, dictionary, narrowly, covers, one, particular, subject, field, e, g, law, and, a, sub, field, dictionary, covers, a, more, specialized, field, e, g, constitutional, law, for, example, the, 23, language, inter, active, terminology, for, europe, is, a, multi, field, dictionary, the, american, national, biography, is, a, single, field, and, the, african, american, national, biography, project, is, a, sub, field, dictionary, in, terms, of, the, coverage, distinction, between, minimizing, dictionaries, and, maximizing, dictionaries, multi, field, dictionaries, tend, to, minimize, coverage, across, subject, fields, for, instance, oxford, dictionary, of, world, religions, and, yadgar, dictionary, of, computer, and, internet, terms, whereas, single, field, and, sub, field, dictionaries, tend, to, maximize, coverage, within, a, limited, subject, field, the, oxford, dictionary, of, english, etymology, another, variant, is, the, glossary, an, alphabetical, list, of, defined, terms, in, a, specialized, field, such, as, medicine, medical, dictionary, the, simplest, dictionary, a, defining, dictionary, provides, a, core, glossary, of, the, simplest, meanings, of, the, simplest, concepts, from, these, other, concepts, can, be, explained, and, defined, in, particular, for, those, who, are, first, learning, a, language, in, english, the, commercial, defining, dictionaries, typically, include, only, one, or, two, meanings, of, under, 2000, words, with, these, the, rest, of, english, and, even, the, 4000, most, common, english, idioms, and, metaphors, can, be, defined, lexicographers, apply, two, basic, philosophies, to, the, defining, of, words, prescriptive, or, descriptive, noah, webster, intent, on, forging, a, distinct, identity, for, the, american, language, altered, spellings, and, accentuated, differences, in, meaning, and, pronunciation, of, some, words, this, is, why, american, english, now, uses, the, spelling, color, while, the, rest, of, the, english, speaking, world, prefers, colour, similarly, british, english, subsequently, underwent, a, few, spelling, changes, that, did, not, affect, american, english, see, further, at, american, and, british, english, spelling, differences, large, 20th, century, dictionaries, such, as, the, oxford, english, dictionary, oed, and, webster, s, third, are, descriptive, and, attempt, to, describe, the, actual, use, of, words, most, dictionaries, of, english, now, apply, the, descriptive, method, to, a, word, s, definition, and, then, outside, of, the, definition, itself, provide, information, alerting, readers, to, attitudes, which, may, influence, their, choices, on, words, often, considered, vulgar, offensive, erroneous, or, easily, confused, merriam, webster, is, subtle, only, adding, italicized, notations, such, as, sometimes, offensive, or, stand, nonstandard, american, heritage, goes, further, discussing, issues, separately, in, numerous, usage, notes, encarta, provides, similar, notes, but, is, more, prescriptive, offering, warnings, and, admonitions, against, the, use, of, certain, words, considered, by, many, to, be, offensive, or, illiterate, such, as, an, offensive, term, for, or, a, taboo, term, meaning, because, of, the, widespread, use, of, dictionaries, in, schools, and, their, acceptance, by, many, as, language, authorities, their, treatment, of, the, language, does, affect, usage, to, some, degree, with, even, the, most, descriptive, dictionaries, providing, conservative, continuity, in, the, long, run, however, the, meanings, of, words, in, english, are, primarily, determined, by, usage, and, the, language, is, being, changed, and, created, every, day, as, jorge, luis, borges, says, in, the, prologue, to, el, otro, el, mismo, it, is, often, forgotten, that, dictionaries, are, artificial, repositories, put, together, well, after, the, languages, they, define, the, roots, of, language, are, irrational, and, of, a, magical, nature, sometimes, the, same, dictionary, can, be, descriptive, in, some, domains, and, prescriptive, in, others, for, example, according, to, ghil, ad, zuckermann, the, oxford, english, hebrew, dictionary, is, at, war, with, itself, whereas, its, coverage, lexical, items, and, glosses, definitions, are, descriptive, and, colloquial, its, vocalization, is, prescriptive, this, internal, conflict, results, in, absurd, sentences, such, as, hi, tahar, g, ot, kshetir, me, as, ti, lamkhon, t, she, ll, tear, me, apart, when, she, sees, what, i, ve, done, to, the, car, whereas, hi, tahar, g, ot, literally, she, will, kill, me, is, colloquial, me, a, variant, of, ma, what, is, archaic, resulting, in, a, combination, that, is, unutterable, in, real, life, a, historical, dictionary, is, a, specific, kind, of, descriptive, dictionary, which, describes, the, development, of, words, and, senses, over, time, usually, using, citations, to, original, source, material, to, support, its, conclusions, in, contrast, to, traditional, dictionaries, which, are, designed, to, be, used, by, human, beings, dictionaries, for, natural, language, processing, nlp, are, built, to, be, used, by, computer, programs, the, final, user, is, a, human, being, but, the, direct, user, is, a, program, such, a, dictionary, does, not, need, to, be, able, to, be, printed, on, paper, the, structure, of, the, content, is, not, linear, ordered, entry, by, entry, but, has, the, form, of, a, complex, network, see, diathesis, alternation, because, most, of, these, dictionaries, are, used, to, control, machine, translations, or, cross, lingual, information, retrieval, clir, the, content, is, usually, multilingual, and, usually, of, huge, size, in, order, to, allow, formalized, exchange, and, merging, of, dictionaries, an, iso, standard, called, lexical, markup, framework, lmf, has, been, defined, and, used, among, the, industrial, and, academic, community, in, many, languages, such, as, the, english, language, the, pronunciation, of, some, words, is, not, consistently, apparent, from, their, spelling, in, these, languages, dictionaries, usually, provide, the, pronunciation, for, example, the, definition, for, the, word, dictionary, might, be, followed, by, the, international, phonetic, alphabet, spelling, d, k, n, r, i, in, british, english, or, d, k, n, r, i, in, american, english, american, english, dictionaries, often, use, their, own, pronunciation, respelling, systems, with, diacritics, for, example, dictionary, is, respelled, as, d, k, sh, n, r, in, the, american, heritage, dictionary, the, ipa, is, more, commonly, used, within, the, british, commonwealth, countries, yet, others, use, their, own, pronunciation, respelling, systems, without, diacritics, for, example, dictionary, may, be, respelled, as, dik, sh, nerr, ee, some, online, or, electronic, dictionaries, provide, audio, recordings, of, words, being, spoken, histories, and, descriptions, of, the, dictionaries, of, other, languages, on, wikipedia, include, the, age, of, the, internet, brought, online, dictionaries, to, the, desktop, and, more, recently, to, the, smart, phone, david, skinner, in, 2013, noted, that, among, the, top, ten, lookups, on, merriam, webster, online, at, this, moment, are, holistic, pragmatic, caveat, esoteric, and, bourgeois, teaching, users, about, words, they, don, t, already, know, has, been, historically, an, aim, of, lexicography, and, modern, dictionaries, do, this, well, there, exist, a, number, of, websites, which, operate, as, online, dictionaries, usually, with, a, specialized, focus, some, of, them, have, exclusively, user, driven, content, often, consisting, of, neologisms, some, of, the, more, notable, examples, are, given, in, list, of, online, dictionaries, and, category, online, dictionaries
