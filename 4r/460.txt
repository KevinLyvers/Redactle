those, who, are, falling, in, love, dean, rubin, says, the, word, comedy, is, derived, from, the, classical, greek, k, m, id, a, which, is, a, compound, of, k, mos, revel, and, id, singing, ode, the, adjective, comic, greek, k, mik, s, which, strictly, means, that, which, relates, to, comedy, is, in, modern, usage, generally, confined, to, the, sense, of, laughter, provoking, of, this, the, word, came, into, modern, usage, through, the, latin, comoedia, and, italian, commedia, and, has, over, time, passed, through, various, shades, of, meaning, the, greeks, and, romans, confined, their, use, of, the, word, comedy, to, descriptions, of, stage, plays, with, happy, endings, aristotle, defined, comedy, as, an, imitation, of, men, worse, than, the, average, where, tragedy, was, an, imitation, of, men, better, than, the, average, however, the, characters, portrayed, in, comedies, were, not, worse, than, average, in, every, way, only, insofar, as, they, are, ridiculous, which, is, a, species, of, the, ugly, the, ridiculous, may, be, defined, as, a, mistake, or, deformity, not, productive, of, pain, or, harm, to, others, the, mask, for, instance, that, excites, laughter, is,

the, term, in, the, title, of, his, poem, la, commedia, as, time, progressed, the, word, came, more, and, more, to, be, associated, with, any, sort, of, performance, intended, to, cause, laughter, during, the, middle, ages, the, term, comedy, became, synonymous, with, satire, and, later, with, humour, in, general, aristotle, s, poetics, was, translated, into, arabic, in, the, medieval, islamic, world, where, it, was, elaborated, upon, by, arabic, writers, and, islamic, philosophers, such, as, abu, bishr, and, his, pupils, al, farabi, avicenna, and, averroes, they, disassociated, comedy, from, greek, dramatic, representation, and, instead, identified, it, with, arabic, poetic, themes, and, forms, such, as, hija, satirical, poetry, they, viewed, comedy, as, simply, the, art, of, reprehension, and, made, no, reference, to, light, and, cheerful, events, or, to, the, troubling, beginnings, and, happy, endings, associated, with, classical, greek, comedy, after, the, latin, translations, of, the, 12th, century, the, term, comedy, gained, a, more, general, meaning, in, medieval, literature, in, the, late, 20th, century, many, scholars, preferred, to, use, the, term, laughter, to, refer, to, the, whole, gamut, of, the, comic, in, order, to, avoid, the, use, of, ambiguous, and, problematically, defined, genres, such, as, the, grotesque, irony, and, satire, starting, from, 425, bce, aristophanes, a, comic, play, and, satirical, author, of, the, ancient, greek, theater, wrote, 40, comedies, 11, of, which, survive, aristophanes, developed, his, type, of, comedy, from, the, earlier, satyr, plays, which, were, often, highly, obscene, the, only, surviving, examples, of, the, satyr, plays, are, by, euripides, which, are, much, later, examples, and, not, representative, of, the, genre, in, ancient, greece, comedy, originated, in, bawdy, and, ribald, songs, or, recitations, apropos, of, phallic, processions, and, fertility, festivals, or, gatherings, around, 335, bce, aristotle, in, his, work, poetics, stated, that, comedy, originated, in, phallic, processions, and, the, light, treatment, of, the, otherwise, base, and, ugly, he, also, adds, that, the, origins, of, comedy, are, obscure, because, it, was, not, treated, seriously, from, its, inception, however, comedy, had, its, own, muse, thalia, aristotle, taught, that, comedy, was, generally, positive, for, society, since, it, brings, forth, happiness, which, for, aristotle, was, the, ideal, state, the, final, goal, in, any, activity, for, aristotle, a, comedy, did, not, need, to, involve, sexual, humor, a, comedy, is, about, the, fortunate, rise, of, a, sympathetic, character, aristotle, divides, comedy, into, three, categories, or, subgenres, farce, romantic, comedy, and, satire, on, the, other, hand, plato, taught, that, comedy, is, a, destruction, to, the, self, he, believed, that, it, produces, an, emotion, that, overrides, rational, self, control, and, learning, in, the, republic, he, says, that, the, guardians, of, the, state, should, avoid, laughter, for, ordinarily, when, one, abandons, himself, to, violent, laughter, his, condition, provokes, a, violent, reaction, plato, says, comedy, should, be, tightly, controlled, if, one, wants, to, achieve, the, ideal, state, also, in, poetics, aristotle, defined, comedy, as, one, of, the, original, four, genres, of, literature, the, other, three, genres, are, tragedy, epic, poetry, and, lyric, poetry, literature, in, general, is, defined, by, aristotle, as, a, mimesis, or, imitation, of, life, comedy, is, the, third, form, of, literature, being, the, most, divorced, from, a, true, mimesis, tragedy, is, the, truest, mimesis, followed, by, epic, poetry, comedy, and, lyric, poetry, the, genre, of, comedy, is, defined, by, a, certain, pattern, according, to, aristotle, s, definition, comedies, begin, with, low, or, base, characters, seeking, insignificant, aims, and, end, with, some, accomplishment, of, the, aims, which, either, lightens, the, initial, baseness, or, reveals, the, insignificance, of, the, aims, comedy, in, its, elizabethan, usage, had, a, very, different, meaning, from, modern, comedy, a, shakespearean, comedy, is, one, that, has, a, happy, ending, usually, involving, marriages, between, the, unmarried, characters, and, a, tone, and, style, that, is, more, light, hearted, than, shakespeare, s, other, plays, the, punch, and, judy, show, has, roots, in, the, 16th, century, italian, commedia, dell, arte, the, figure, of, punch, derives, from, the, neapolitan, stock, character, of, pulcinella, the, figure, who, later, became, mr, punch, made, his, first, recorded, appearance, in, england, in, 1662, punch, and, judy, are, performed, in, the, spirit, of, outrageous, comedy, often, provoking, shocked, laughter, and, are, dominated, by, the, anarchic, clowning, of, mr, punch, appearing, at, a, significant, period, in, british, history, professor, glyn, edwards, states, went, down, particularly, well, with, restoration, british, audiences, fun, starved, after, years, of, puritanism, we, soon, changed, punch, s, name, transformed, him, from, a, marionette, to, a, hand, puppet, and, he, became, really, a, spirit, of, britain, a, subversive, maverick, who, defies, authority, a, kind, of, puppet, equivalent, to, our, political, cartoons, in, early, 19th, century, england, pantomime, acquired, its, present, form, which, includes, slapstick, comedy, and, featured, the, first, mainstream, clown, joseph, grimaldi, while, comedy, routines, also, featured, heavily, in, british, music, hall, theatre, which, became, popular, in, the, 1850s, british, comedians, who, honed, their, skills, in, music, hall, sketches, include, charlie, chaplin, stan, laurel, and, dan, leno, english, music, hall, comedian, and, theatre, impresario, fred, karno, developed, a, form, of, sketch, comedy, without, dialogue, in, the, 1890s, and, chaplin, and, laurel, were, among, the, comedians, who, worked, for, his, company, karno, was, a, pioneer, of, slapstick, and, in, his, biography, laurel, stated, fred, karno, didn, t, teach, charlie, and, me, all, we, know, about, comedy, he, just, taught, us, most, of, it, film, producer, hal, roach, stated, fred, karno, is, not, only, a, genius, he, is, the, man, who, originated, slapstick, comedy, we, in, hollywood, owe, much, to, him, american, vaudeville, emerged, in, the, 1880s, and, remained, popular, until, the, 1930s, and, featured, comedians, such, as, w, c, fields, buster, keaton, and, the, marx, brothers, surreal, humour, also, known, as, absurdist, humour, or, surreal, comedy, is, a, form, of, humour, predicated, on, deliberate, violations, of, causal, reasoning, producing, events, and, behaviours, that, are, obviously, illogical, constructions, of, surreal, humour, tend, to, involve, bizarre, juxtapositions, incongruity, non, sequiturs, irrational, or, absurd, situations, and, expressions, of, nonsense, the, humour, arises, from, a, subversion, of, audience, s, expectations, so, that, amusement, is, founded, on, unpredictability, separate, from, a, logical, analysis, of, the, situation, the, humour, derived, gets, its, appeal, from, the, ridiculousness, and, unlikeliness, of, the, situation, the, genre, has, roots, in, surrealism, in, the, arts, surreal, humour, is, the, effect, of, illogic, and, absurdity, being, used, for, humorous, effect, under, such, premises, people, can, identify, precursors, and, early, examples, of, surreal, humour, at, least, since, the, 19th, century, such, as, lewis, carroll, s, alice, s, adventures, in, wonderland, and, through, the, looking, glass, which, both, use, illogic, and, absurdity, hookah, smoking, caterpillars, croquet, matches, using, live, flamingos, as, mallets, etc, for, humorous, effect, many, of, edward, lear, s, children, stories, and, poems, contain, nonsense, and, are, basically, surreal, in, approach, for, example, the, story, of, the, four, little, children, who, went, round, the, world, 1871, is, filled, with, contradictory, statements, and, odd, images, intended, to, provoke, amusement, such, as, the, following, after, a, time, they, saw, some, land, at, a, distance, and, when, they, came, to, it, they, found, it, was, an, island, made, of, water, quite, surrounded, by, earth, besides, that, it, was, bordered, by, evanescent, isthmuses, with, a, great, gulf, stream, running, about, all, over, it, so, that, it, was, perfectly, beautiful, and, contained, only, a, single, tree, 503, feet, high, in, the, early, 20th, century, several, avant, garde, movements, including, the, dadaists, surrealists, and, futurists, began, to, argue, for, an, art, that, was, random, jarring, and, illogical, the, goals, of, these, movements, were, in, some, sense, serious, and, they, were, committed, to, undermining, the, solemnity, and, self, satisfaction, of, the, contemporary, artistic, establishment, as, a, result, much, of, their, art, was, intentionally, amusing, a, famous, example, is, marcel, duchamp, s, fountain, 1917, an, inverted, urinal, signed, r, mutt, this, became, one, of, the, most, famous, and, influential, pieces, of, art, in, history, and, one, of, the, earliest, examples, of, the, found, object, movement, it, is, also, a, joke, relying, on, the, inversion, of, the, item, s, function, as, expressed, by, its, title, as, well, as, its, incongruous, presence, in, an, art, exhibition, the, advent, of, cinema, in, the, late, 19th, century, and, later, radio, and, television, in, the, 20th, century, broadened, the, access, of, comedians, to, the, general, public, charlie, chaplin, through, silent, film, became, one, of, the, best, known, faces, on, earth, the, silent, tradition, lived, on, well, into, the, late, 20th, century, through, mime, artists, like, marcel, marceau, and, the, slapstick, comedy, of, artists, like, rowan, atkinson, as, mr, bean, the, tradition, of, the, circus, clown, also, continued, with, such, as, bozo, the, clown, in, the, united, states, and, oleg, popov, in, russia, radio, provided, new, possibilities, with, britain, producing, the, influential, surreal, humour, of, the, goon, show, after, the, second, world, war, the, goons, influence, spread, to, the, american, radio, and, recording, troupe, the, firesign, theatre, american, cinema, has, produced, a, great, number, of, globally, renowned, comedy, artists, from, laurel, and, hardy, the, three, stooges, abbott, and, costello, dean, martin, and, jerry, lewis, bob, hope, and, phyllis, diller, during, the, mid, 20th, century, to, performers, like, george, carlin, bill, cosby, joan, rivers, robin, williams, and, eddie, murphy, toward, the, end, of, the, century, hollywood, attracted, many, international, talents, like, the, british, comics, peter, sellers, dudley, moore, and, sacha, baron, cohen, canadian, comics, dan, aykroyd, jim, carrey, and, mike, myers, and, the, australian, comedian, paul, hogan, famous, for, crocodile, dundee, other, centres, of, creative, comic, activity, have, been, the, cinema, of, hong, kong, bollywood, and, french, farce, american, television, has, also, been, an, influential, force, in, world, comedy, with, american, series, like, m, a, s, h, seinfeld, and, the, simpsons, achieving, large, followings, around, the, world, british, television, comedy, also, remains, influential, with, quintessential, works, including, fawlty, towers, monty, python, dad, s, army, blackadder, and, the, office, australian, satirist, barry, humphries, whose, comic, creations, include, the, housewife, and, gigastar, dame, edna, everage, for, his, delivery, of, dadaist, and, absurdist, humour, to, millions, was, described, by, biographer, anne, pender, in, 2010, as, not, only, the, most, significant, theatrical, figure, of, our, time, the, most, significant, comedian, to, emerge, since, charlie, chaplin, by, 200, bc, in, ancient, sanskrit, drama, bharata, muni, s, natya, shastra, defined, humour, h, syam, as, one, of, the, nine, nava, rasas, or, principle, rasas, emotional, responses, which, can, be, inspired, in, the, audience, by, bhavas, the, imitations, of, emotions, that, the, actors, perform, each, rasa, was, associated, with, a, specific, bhavas, portrayed, on, stage, in, the, case, of, humour, it, was, associated, with, mirth, hasya, the, phenomena, connected, with, laughter, and, that, which, provokes, it, have, been, carefully, investigated, by, psychologists, they, agree, the, predominant, characteristics, are, incongruity, or, contrast, in, the, object, and, shock, or, emotional, seizure, on, the, part, of, the, subject, it, has, also, been, held, that, the, feeling, of, superiority, is, an, essential, factor, thus, thomas, hobbes, speaks, of, laughter, as, a, sudden, glory, modern, investigators, have, paid, much, attention, to, the, origin, both, of, laughter, and, of, smiling, as, well, as, the, development, of, the, play, instinct, and, its, emotional, expression, george, meredith, said, that, one, excellent, test, of, the, civilization, of, a, country, i, take, to, be, the, flourishing, of, the, comic, idea, and, comedy, and, the, test, of, true, comedy, is, that, it, shall, awaken, thoughtful, laughter, laughter, is, said, to, be, the, cure, for, being, sick, studies, show, that, people, who, laugh, more, often, get, sick, less, american, literary, theorist, kenneth, burke, writes, that, the, comic, frame, in, rhetoric, is, neither, wholly, euphemistic, nor, wholly, debunking, hence, it, provides, the, charitable, attitude, towards, people, that, is, required, for, purposes, of, persuasion, and, co, operation, but, at, the, same, time, maintains, our, shrewdness, concerning, the, simplicities, of, cashing, in, the, purpose, of, the, comic, frame, is, to, satirize, a, given, circumstance, and, promote, change, by, doing, so, the, comic, frame, makes, fun, of, situations, and, people, while, simultaneously, provoking, thought, the, comic, frame, does, not, aim, to, vilify, in, its, analysis, but, rather, rebuke, the, stupidity, and, foolery, of, those, involved, in, the, circumstances, for, example, on, the, daily, show, jon, stewart, uses, the, comic, frame, to, intervene, in, political, arguments, often, offering, crude, humor, in, sudden, contrast, to, serious, news, in, a, segment, on, president, obama, s, trip, to, china, stewart, remarks, on, america, s, debt, to, the, chinese, government, while, also, having, a, weak, relationship, with, the, country, after, depicting, this, dismal, situation, stewart, shifts, to, speak, directly, to, president, obama, calling, upon, him, to, shine, that, turd, up, for, stewart, and, his, audience, introducing, coarse, language, into, what, is, otherwise, a, serious, commentary, on, the, state, of, foreign, relations, serves, to, frame, the, segment, comically, creating, a, serious, tone, underlying, the, comedic, agenda, presented, by, stewart, comedy, may, be, divided, into, multiple, genres, based, on, the, source, of, humor, the, method, of, delivery, and, the, context, in, which, it, is, delivered, the, different, forms, of, comedy, often, overlap, and, most, comedy, can, fit, into, multiple, genres, some, of, the, subgenres, of, comedy, are, farce, comedy, of, manners, burlesque, and, satire, some, comedy, apes, certain, cultural, forms, for, instance, parody, and, satire, often, imitate, the, conventions, of, the, genre, they, are, parodying, or, satirizing, for, example, in, the, united, states, parodies, of, newspapers, and, television, news, include, the, onion, and, the, colbert, report, in, australia, shows, such, as, kath, kim, utopia, and, shaun, micallef, s, mad, as, hell, perform, the, same, role, self, deprecation, is, a, technique, of, comedy, used, by, many, comedians, who, focus, on, their, misfortunes, and, foibles, in, order, to, entertain, stand, up, comedy, is, a, mode, of, comic, performance, in, which, the, performer, addresses, the, audience, directly, usually, speaking, in, their, own, person, rather, than, as, a, dramatic, character, the, deliberate, use, by, menard, of, the, term, le, rire, rather, than, l, humour, reflects, accurately, the, current, evidency, to, incorporate, all, instances, of, the, comic, in, the, analysis, while, the, classification, in, genres, and, fields, such, as, grotesque, humour, and, even, irony, or, satire, always, poses, problems, the, terms, humour, and, laughter, are, therefore, pragmatically, used, in, recent, historiography, to, cover, the, entire, spectrum, that, comedy, sprang, up, and, took, shape, in, connection, with, dionysiac, or, phallic, ritual, has, never, been, doubted
