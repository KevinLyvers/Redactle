anderson, and, diamanda, gal, s, there, is, another, definition, of, avant, gardism, that, distinguishes, it, from, modernism, peter, b, rger, for, example, says, avant, gardism, rejects, the, institution, of, art, and, challenges, social, and, artistic, values, and, so, necessarily, involves, political, social, and, cultural, factors, according, to, the, composer, and, musicologist, larry,

or, pretentiously, progressive, post, punk, artists, from, the, late, 1970s, rejected, traditional, rock, sensibilities, in, favor, of, an, avant, garde, aesthetic, whereas, the, avant, garde, has, a, significant, history, in, 20th, century, music, it, is, more, pronounced, in, theatre, and, performance, art, and, often, in, conjunction, with, music, and, sound, design, innovations, as, well, as,
