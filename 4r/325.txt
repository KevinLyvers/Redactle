rope, tuned, skin, covered, goblet, drum, played, with, bare, hands, originally, from, west, africa, according, to, the, bambara, people, in, mali, the, name, of, the, djembe, comes, from, the, saying, anke, dj, anke, b, which, translates, to, everyone, gather, together, in, peace, and, defines, the, drum, s, purpose, in, the, bambara, language, dj, is, the, verb, for, gather, and, b, translates, as, peace, the, djembe, has, a, body, or, shell, carved, of, hardwood, and, a, drumhead, made, of, untreated, not, limed, rawhide, most, commonly, made, from, goatskin, excluding, rings, djembes, have, an, exterior, diameter, of, 30, 38, cm, 12, 15, in, and, a, height, of, 58, 63, cm, 23, 25, in, the, majority, have, a, diameter, in, the, 13, to, 14, inch, range, the, weight, of, a, djembe, ranges, from, 5, kg, to, 13, kg, 11, 29, lb, and, depends, on, size, and, shell, material, a, medium, size, djembe, carved, from, one, of, the, traditional, woods, including, skin, rings, and, rope, weighs, around, 9, kg, 20, lb, the, djembe, can, produce, a, wide, variety, of, sounds, making, it, an, extremely, versatile, drum, the, drum, is, very, loud, allowing, it, to, be, heard, clearly, as, a, solo, instrument, over, a, large, percussion, ensemble, the, malink, people, say, that, a, skilled, drummer, is, one, who, can, make, the, djembe, talk, meaning, that, the, player, can, tell, an, emotional, story, the, malink, never, used, the, djembe, as, a, signaling, drum, traditionally, the, djembe, is, played, only, by, men, as, are, the, dunun, that, always, accompany, the, djembe, conversely, other, percussion, instruments, that, are, commonly, played, as, part, of, an, ensemble, such, as, the, shekere, a, hollowed, out, gourd, covered, with, a, net, of, beads, karignan, a, tubular, bell, and, kese, kese, a, woven, basket, rattle, are, usually, played, by, women, even, today, it, is, rare, to, see, women, play, djembe, or, dunun, in, west, africa, and, african, women, express, astonishment, when, they, do, see, a, female, djembe, player, there, is, general, agreement, that, the, origin, of, the, djembe, is, associated, with, the, mandinka, caste, of, blacksmiths, known, as, numu, the, wide, dispersion, of, the, djembe, drum, throughout, west, africa, may, be, due, to, numu, migrations, during, the, first, millennium, ad, despite, the, association, of, the, djembe, with, the, numu, there, are, no, hereditary, restrictions, on, who, may, become, a, djembefola, literally, one, who, plays, the, djembe, this, is, in, contrast, to, instruments, whose, use, is, reserved, for, members, of, the, griot, caste, such, as, the, balafon, kora, and, ngoni, the, djembe, is, not, a, griot, instrument, anyone, who, plays, djembe, is, a, djembefola, the, term, does, not, imply, a, particular, level, of, skill, geographically, the, traditional, distribution, of, the, djembe, is, associated, with, the, mali, empire, which, dates, back, to, 1230, ad, and, included, parts, of, the, modern, day, countries, of, guinea, mali, burkina, faso, ivory, coast, gambia, and, senegal, however, due, to, the, lack, of, written, records, in, west, african, countries, it, is, unclear, whether, the, djembe, predates, or, postdates, the, mali, empire, it, seems, likely, that, the, history, of, the, djembe, reaches, back, for, at, least, several, centuries, and, possibly, more, than, a, millennium, the, goblet, shape, of, the, djembe, suggests, that, it, originally, may, have, been, created, from, a, mortar, mortars, are, widely, used, throughout, west, africa, for, food, preparation, prior, to, the, 1950s, and, the, decolonization, of, west, africa, due, to, the, very, limited, travel, of, native, africans, outside, their, own, ethnic, group, the, djembe, was, known, only, in, its, original, area, the, djembe, first, came, to, the, attention, of, audiences, outside, west, africa, with, the, efforts, of, fod, ba, ke, ta, who, in, 1952, founded, les, ballets, africains, the, ballet, toured, extensively, in, europe, and, was, declared, guinea, s, first, national, ballet, by, guinea, s, first, president, s, kou, tour, after, guinea, gained, independence, in, 1958, to, be, followed, by, two, more, national, ballets, the, ballet, d, armee, in, 1961, and, ballet, djoliba, in, 1964, tour, s, policies, alienated, guinea, from, the, west, and, he, followed, the, eastern, bloc, model, of, using, the, country, s, culture, and, music, for, promotional, means, he, and, fod, ba, ke, ta, who, had, become, a, close, friend, of, tour, saw, the, ballets, as, a, way, to, secularize, traditional, customs, and, rites, of, different, ethnic, groups, in, guinea, the, ballets, combined, rhythms, and, dances, from, widely, different, spiritual, backgrounds, in, a, single, performance, which, suited, the, aim, of, tour, s, demystification, program, of, doing, away, with, fetishist, ritual, practices, tour, generously, supported, the, ballets, to, the, point, of, building, a, special, rehearsal, and, performance, space, in, his, palace, for, ballet, djoliba, and, until, his, death, in, 1984, financed, extensive, world, wide, performance, tours, which, brought, the, djembe, to, the, attention, of, western, audiences, other, countries, followed, tour, s, example, and, founded, national, ballets, in, the, 1960s, including, ivory, coast, ballet, koteba, mali, les, ballets, malien, and, senegal, le, ballet, national, du, senegal, each, with, its, own, attached, political, agenda, in, the, united, states, ladji, camara, a, member, of, ballets, africains, in, the, 1950s, started, teaching, djembe, in, the, 1960s, and, continued, to, teach, into, the, 1990s, camara, performed, extensively, with, babatunde, olatunji, during, the, 1970s, greatly, raising, awareness, of, the, instrument, in, the, us, after, the, death, of, sekou, tour, in, 1984, funding, for, the, ballets, dried, up, and, a, number, of, djembefolas, who, were, never, paid, well, by, the, ballets, emigrated, and, made, regular, teaching, and, performance, appearances, in, the, west, including, mamady, ke, ta, belgium, us, famoudou, konat, germany, and, epizo, bangoura, france, us, and, australia, a, number, of, other, djembefolas, m, bemba, bangoura, abdoulaye, diakit, bolokada, conde, mohamed, bangourak, bangoura, and, babara, bangoura, among, others, followed, their, example, establishing, a, sizeable, population, of, expatriate, performers, and, teachers, in, many, western, countries, the, 1991, documentary, djembefola, by, laurent, chevallier, depicts, mamady, ke, ta, s, return, to, the, village, of, his, birth, after, a, 26, year, absence, upon, release, the, movie, won, the, wisselzak, trophy, and, special, jury, award, at, the, international, documentary, film, festival, amsterdam, and, the, audience, award, at, the, marseille, festival, of, documentary, film, and, brought, the, djembe, to, the, attention, of, a, wide, audience, a, 1998, follow, up, documentary, m, g, balu, also, by, chevallier, contains, concert, footage, uniting, four, master, drummers, soungalo, coulibaly, mamady, keita, famoudou, konat, and, doudou, n, diaye, rose, on, stage, the, oscar, nominated, 2007, drama, the, visitor, ensured, that, the, djembe, was, noticed, internationally, by, mainstream, viewers, the, djembe, has, been, used, by, many, western, artists, including, paul, simon, cirque, du, soleil, and, tool, raising, awareness, of, the, instrument, with, western, audiences, recordings, of, the, djembe, far, surpass, the, number, of, recordings, of, any, other, african, drum, beginning, in, the, late, 1980s, a, slew, of, djembe, centric, recordings, was, released, a, trend, that, as, of, 2014, shows, no, sign, of, abating, this, is, significant, because, these, recordings, are, driven, by, the, demand, of, western, audiences, there, are, almost, no, djembe, recordings, within, african, markets, among, the, earliest, educational, resources, available, to, a, student, of, the, djembe, were, an, educational, vhs, tape, by, babatunde, olatunji, released, in, 1993, as, well, as, books, by, serge, blanc, famoudou, konat, and, mamady, ke, ta, in, 1998, these, were, supplemented, by, a, three, volume, vhs, set, by, ke, ta, and, in, 2000, by, a, vhs, tape, by, epizo, bangoura, since, then, the, market, for, educational, materials, has, grown, significantly, as, of, 2014, dozens, of, educational, books, cds, and, videos, are, available, to, an, aspiring, player, starting, in, the, 1980s, a, number, of, guinean, djembefolas, epizo, bangoura, famoudou, konat, mamady, ke, ta, started, hosting, study, tours, to, guinea, allowing, djembe, students, to, experience, guinean, culture, first, hand, many, other, djembefolas, followed, suit, as, of, 2014, a, potential, visitor, can, select, from, tens, of, djembe, tours, each, year, djembe, tourism, created, a, market, for, djembefolas, in, guinea, that, previously, did, not, exist, young, djembefolas, try, to, emulate, the, success, of, their, predecessors, and, cater, to, the, needs, of, the, tourists, leading, to, change, and, commodification, of, the, original, djembe, culture, most, djembes, from, mali, guinea, burkina, faso, and, senegal, are, still, hand, carved, from, traditional, species, of, wood, using, traditional, tools, and, methods, in, the, 1990s, djembes, started, being, produced, elsewhere, such, as, in, ghana, nigeria, south, africa, and, indonesia, often, using, modern, machinery, and, substitute, species, of, wood, such, as, tweneboa, cordia, platythyrsa, or, mahogany, swietenia, mahagoni, or, toona, sureni, however, these, woods, being, softer, and, less, dense, are, not, as, suitable, as, the, traditional, woods, a, number, of, western, percussion, instrument, manufacturers, also, produce, djembe, like, instruments, often, with, fibreglass, bodies, synthetic, skins, and, a, key, tuning, system, the, traditional, barriers, against, women, djembe, and, dunun, players, have, come, down, over, time, for, its, size, the, djembe, is, an, unusually, loud, drum, the, volume, of, the, drum, rises, with, increasing, skin, tension, on, a, djembe, tuned, to, solo, pitch, skilled, players, can, achieve, sound, pressure, of, more, than, 105, db, about, the, same, volume, as, a, jackhammer, djembe, players, use, three, basic, sounds, bass, tone, and, slap, which, have, low, medium, and, high, pitch, respectively, these, sounds, are, achieved, by, varying, the, striking, technique, and, position, other, sounds, are, possible, masters, achieve, as, many, as, twenty, five, distinctly, different, sounds, but, these, additional, sounds, are, used, rarely, mainly, for, special, effects, during, a, solo, performance, djembe, kan, literally, the, sound, of, the, djembe, a, skilled, player, can, use, the, sounds, to, create, very, complex, rhythmic, patterns, the, combination, of, rhythm, and, the, differently, pitched, sounds, often, leads, an, inexpert, listener, to, believe, that, more, than, one, drum, is, being, played, the, bass, sound, is, produced, by, striking, the, drum, with, the, palm, and, flat, fingers, near, the, center, of, the, skin, tone, and, slap, are, produced, by, striking, the, drum, closer, to, the, edge, the, contact, area, of, the, fingers, determines, whether, the, sound, is, a, tone, or, a, slap, for, a, tone, most, of, the, area, of, the, fingers, and, the, edge, of, the, palm, contact, the, skin, whereas, for, a, slap, the, contact, area, is, limited, to, the, edge, of, the, palm, and, the, fingertips, the, basic, sounds, are, played, open, meaning, that, the, hands, rebound, immediately, after, a, strike, so, the, contact, time, with, the, skin, is, as, short, as, possible, acoustically, a, djembe, is, a, helmholtz, resonator, the, frequency, of, the, bass, is, determined, by, the, size, and, shape, of, the, shell, and, independent, of, the, amount, of, tension, on, the, skin, in, contrast, the, pitch, of, tones, and, slaps, rises, as, the, tension, of, the, skin, is, increased, the, bass, has, a, frequency, of, 65, 80, hz, depending, on, the, size, of, the, drum, and, the, amount, of, tension, on, the, skin, tone, frequency, varies, from, 300, hz, to, 420, hz, and, slap, frequency, from, 700, hz, to, 1000, hz, with, audible, overtones, reaching, beyond, 4, khz, the, difference, in, pitch, of, the, sounds, arises, because, the, different, striking, techniques, selectively, emphasize, specific, vibrational, modes, of, the, drum, head, a, tone, emphasizes, the, 0, 1, mode, while, suppressing, the, bass, helmholtz, resonance, and, higher, order, modes, as, much, as, possible, a, slap, emphasizes, the, 2, 1, 0, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, and, 0, 3, modes, as, well, as, higher, order, modes, while, suppressing, the, helmholtz, resonance, and, the, 0, 1, and, 1, 1, modes, skilled, players, can, also, produce, a, medium, pitched, sound, between, a, tone, and, slap, that, is, variously, called, third, slap, tonpalo, or, l, this, sound, emphasizes, the, 1, 1, mode, while, suppressing, all, other, modes, as, much, as, possible, by, slightly, varying, striking, and, finger, position, skilled, players, can, selectively, emphasize, different, slap, harmonics, and, create, melodies, of, differently, pitched, slaps, traditionally, the, djembe, forms, an, ensemble, with, a, number, of, other, djembes, and, one, or, more, dunun, except, for, the, lead, or, solo, djembe, all, instruments, play, a, recurring, rhythmic, figure, that, is, known, as, an, accompaniment, pattern, or, accompaniment, part, the, figure, repeats, after, a, certain, number, of, beats, known, as, a, cycle, the, most, common, cycle, length, is, four, beats, but, cycles, often, have, other, lengths, such, as, two, three, six, eight, or, more, beats, some, rhythms, in, the, dundunba, family, from, the, hamana, region, in, guinea, have, cycle, lengths, of, 16, 24, 28, or, 32, beats, among, others, cycles, longer, than, eight, beats, are, rare, for, djembe, accompaniments, longer, cycles, are, normally, played, only, by, the, dununba, or, sangban, each, instrument, plays, a, different, rhythmic, figure, and, the, cycle, lengths, of, the, different, instruments, need, not, necessarily, be, the, same, this, interplay, results, in, complex, rhythmic, patterns, polyrhythms, the, different, accompaniment, parts, are, played, on, djembes, that, are, tuned, to, different, pitches, this, emphasizes, the, polyrhythm, and, creates, a, composite, overall, melody, the, number, of, instruments, in, the, ensemble, varies, with, the, region, and, occasion, in, mali, a, traditional, ensemble, often, consists, of, one, dunun, called, konkoni, and, one, djembe, the, konkoni, and, djembe, are, in, a, rhythmic, dialog, with, each, drum, taking, turns, playing, accompaniment, while, the, other, instrument, plays, improvised, solos, if, a, second, dunun, player, is, available, he, supplements, the, ensemble, with, a, khassonka, dunun, which, is, a, bass, drum, similar, in, build, to, a, konkoni, but, larger, in, guinea, a, typical, ensemble, uses, three, djembes, and, three, dunun, called, sangban, medium, pitch, dundunba, bass, pitch, and, kenkeni, high, pitch, also, called, kensedeni, if, an, ensemble, includes, more, than, one, djembe, the, highest, pitched, and, therefore, loudest, djembe, plays, solo, phrases, and, the, other, djembes, and, dunun, play, accompaniment, an, ensemble, may, have, only, two, dunun, depending, on, whether, a, village, has, enough, dunun, players, and, is, wealthy, enough, to, afford, three, dunun, a, djembe, and, dunun, ensemble, traditionally, does, not, play, music, for, people, to, simply, sit, back, and, listen, to, instead, the, ensemble, creates, rhythm, for, people, to, dance, sing, clap, or, work, to, the, western, distinction, between, musicians, and, audience, is, inappropriate, in, a, traditional, context, a, rhythm, is, rarely, played, as, a, performance, but, is, participatory, musicians, dancers, singers, and, onlookers, are, all, part, of, the, ensemble, and, frequently, change, roles, while, the, music, is, in, progress, musicians, and, participants, often, form, a, circle, with, the, centre, of, the, circle, reserved, for, dancers, depending, on, the, particular, rhythm, being, played, dances, may, be, performed, by, groups, of, men, and, or, women, with, choreographed, steps, or, single, dancers, may, take, turns, at, performing, short, solos, the, lead, djembe, s, role, is, to, play, solo, phrases, that, accentuate, the, movements, of, the, dancers, often, the, aim, is, to, mark, the, dancers, feet, that, is, to, play, rhythmic, patterns, that, are, synchronized, with, the, dancers, steps, individual, solo, dances, are, not, choreographed, with, the, dancer, freely, moving, in, whatever, way, feels, appropriate, at, that, moment, marking, a, solo, dancer, s, feet, requires, the, lead, djembefola, to, have, strong, rapport, with, the, dancer, and, it, takes, many, years, of, experience, for, a, djembefola, to, acquire, the, necessary, rhythmic, repertoire, the, lead, djembefola, also, improvises, to, a, rhythm, at, times, when, no, one, is, dancing, while, there, is, considerable, freedom, in, such, improvisation, the, solo, phrases, are, not, random, instead, individual, rhythms, have, specific, key, patterns, signature, phrases, that, the, soloist, is, expected, to, know, and, integrate, into, his, improvisation, a, skilled, soloist, will, also, play, phrases, that, harmonize, with, the, background, rhythm, groove, that, is, created, by, the, other, instruments, traditionally, crafted, djembes, are, carved, from, a, single, log, of, hardwood, a, number, of, different, wood, species, are, used, all, of, which, are, hard, and, dense, hardness, and, density, are, important, factors, for, the, sound, and, projection, of, the, djembe, the, most, prized, djembe, wood, is, lenke, afzelia, africana, not, because, it, necessarily, sounds, better, than, other, woods, but, because, the, malink, believe, that, its, spiritual, qualities, are, superior, malink, traditional, wisdom, states, that, a, spiritual, energy, or, nyama, runs, through, all, things, living, or, dead, besides, lenke, traditional, woods, include, djalla, khaya, senegalensis, dugura, cordyla, africana, gueni, pterocarpus, erinaceus, gele, prosopis, africana, and, iroko, milicia, excelsa, shells, are, carved, soon, after, the, tree, is, felled, while, the, wood, still, retains, some, moisture, and, is, softer, this, makes, the, wood, easier, to, carve, and, avoids, radial, splits, that, tend, to, develop, in, logs, that, are, allowed, to, dry, naturally, carvers, use, simple, hand, tools, such, as, axes, adzes, spoke, shaves, and, rasps, to, shape, the, shell, a, well, carved, djembe, does, not, have, a, smooth, interior, but, a, texture, of, scallops, or, shallow, grooves, that, influence, the, sound, of, the, instrument, djembes, with, smooth, interiors, have, tones, and, slaps, with, too, much, sustain, often, interior, grooves, form, a, spiral, pattern, which, indicates, a, carver, taking, pride, in, his, work, the, djembe, is, headed, with, a, rawhide, skin, most, commonly, goatskin, other, skins, such, as, antelope, cow, kangaroo, or, horse, can, be, used, as, well, thicker, skins, such, as, cow, have, a, warmer, sound, with, more, overtones, in, the, slaps, thinner, skins, have, a, sharper, sound, with, fewer, overtones, in, the, slaps, and, are, louder, thick, skins, make, it, easier, to, play, full, tones, but, more, difficult, to, play, sharp, slaps, for, thin, skins, the, opposite, applies, thin, skins, are, louder, than, thick, ones, thick, skins, such, as, cow, are, particularly, hard, on, the, hands, of, the, player, and, cause, more, callousing, than, goatskins, skins, from, dry, and, hot, climate, areas, and, poorly, fed, goats, are, preferred, for, djembes, because, of, their, low, fat, content, skins, from, cold, climate, goats, with, high, value, nutrition, have, more, than, double, the, fat, content, they, tend, to, sound, dull, and, lifeless, in, comparison, even, though, the, fat, content, of, male, goats, is, lower, than, that, of, female, goats, many, players, prefer, female, skins, because, they, do, not, smell, as, strongly, and, are, reputed, to, be, softer, the, skin, is, mounted, with, the, spine, running, through, the, centre, of, the, drum, head, with, the, line, of, the, spine, pointing, at, the, player, so, the, hands, strike, either, side, of, the, spine, animal, skins, are, thicker, at, the, spine, than, the, sides, mounting, the, skin, with, the, spine, centered, ensures, that, the, left, and, right, hand, play, symmetric, areas, of, equal, size, and, thickness, in, turn, this, helps, to, minimize, differences, in, pitch, of, the, notes, played, by, the, left, and, right, hand, normally, the, head, end, of, the, spine, points, at, the, player, so, the, hands, strike, the, area, of, the, skin, that, used, to, be, the, shoulders, of, the, goat, with, thicker, skins, such, as, from, a, cow, or, horse, the, skin, round, is, usually, taken, from, the, side, of, the, hide, so, it, does, not, include, the, spine, which, is, too, thick, for, use, on, a, djembe, skins, may, be, shaved, prior, to, mounting, or, afterwards, or, may, be, de, haired, by, liming, liming, weakens, skins, some, djembefolas, also, claim, that, limed, skins, are, harder, on, their, hands, and, do, not, sound, as, good, as, untreated, skins, factory, made, djembes, often, use, skins, made, from, synthetic, materials, such, as, fiberskyn, modern, djembes, exclusively, use, synthetic, rope, most, commonly, of, kernmantle, construction, 4, 5, mm, in, diameter, low, stretch, static, rope, is, preferred, most, djembe, ropes, have, a, polyester, core, with, a, 16, or, 32, plait, mantle, and, around, 5, stretch, very, low, stretch, 1, rope, materials, such, as, vectran, and, spectra, are, used, only, rarely, due, to, their, much, higher, cost, the, mounting, system, for, the, skin, has, undergone, a, number, of, changes, over, time, originally, the, skin, was, attached, by, wooden, pegs, that, were, driven, through, holes, in, the, skin, and, the, shell, near, the, playing, edge, four, to, five, people, would, stretch, the, wet, skin, over, the, drum, to, apply, tension, while, the, pegs, were, driven, into, the, bowl, the, shrinkage, of, the, skin, while, it, dried, then, applied, sufficient, additional, tension, for, the, skin, to, resonate, a, similar, mounting, technique, is, still, used, by, the, landouma, a, subgroup, of, the, baga, people, for, a, djembe, like, drum, known, as, a, gumbe, this, mounting, technique, most, likely, goes, back, hundreds, of, years, the, exact, period, is, unknown, up, until, the, 1980s, the, most, common, mounting, system, used, twisted, strips, of, cowhide, as, rope, the, skin, was, attached, with, rings, made, of, cowhide, one, ring, was, sewn, into, the, perimeter, of, the, skin, and, a, second, ring, placed, below, it, with, loops, holding, the, skin, in, place, and, securing, the, two, rings, together, a, long, strip, of, cowhide, was, used, to, lace, up, the, drum, applying, tension, between, the, top, ring, and, a, third, ring, placed, around, the, stem, to, apply, further, tension, the, vertical, sections, of, the, rope, were, woven, into, a, diamond, pattern, that, shortens, the, verticals, wooden, pegs, wedged, between, the, shell, and, the, lacing, could, be, used, to, increase, tension, still, further, the, pitch, of, these, traditional, djembes, was, much, lower, than, it, is, today, because, the, natural, materials, imposed, a, limit, on, the, amount, of, tension, that, could, be, applied, prior, to, playing, djembefolas, heated, the, skin, near, the, flames, of, an, open, fire, which, drives, moisture, out, of, the, skin, and, causes, it, to, shrink, and, increase, the, pitch, of, the, drum, this, process, had, to, be, repeated, frequently, every, 15, 30, minutes, the, modern, mounting, system, arose, in, the, early, seventies, when, touring, ballets, came, into, contact, with, synthetic, rope, used, by, the, military, initially, the, synthetic, rope, was, used, to, replace, the, twisted, cowhide, strips, however, the, rope, could, now, be, tightened, to, the, point, where, it, tore, through, the, skin, in, response, drum, makers, started, using, steel, rings, instead, of, twisted, cowhide, to, hold, the, skin, in, place, despite, objections, from, many, djembefolas, the, modern, mounting, system, gradually, displaced, the, traditional, one, and, by, 1991, had, completely, replaced, it, the, skin, is, held, in, place, by, being, trapped, between, the, top, ring, called, the, crown, ring, and, the, ring, below, it, called, the, flesh, ring, a, third, ring, the, bottom, ring, is, placed, around, the, stem, the, rings, are, commonly, made, from, 6, 8, mm, in, rebar, a, series, of, cow, hitches, on, the, crown, ring, and, bottom, ring, form, loops, through, these, loops, a, length, of, rope, connects, the, crown, ring, and, the, bottom, ring, tightening, this, rope, applies, tension, as, the, vertical, rope, is, tensioned, the, cow, hitches, on, the, crown, ring, press, the, skin, against, the, flesh, ring, below, this, attaches, the, skin, to, the, flesh, ring, very, securely, and, stretches, the, skin, over, the, bearing, edge, of, the, drum, a, variation, of, this, technique, introduced, in, the, early, 2000s, uses, three, rings, instead, of, two, the, idea, of, this, technique, is, to, increase, the, number, of, friction, points, trapping, the, skin, to, make, it, less, likely, for, the, skin, to, slip, between, the, rings, as, tension, is, applied, there, is, no, firm, consensus, in, the, djembe, community, as, to, whether, the, benefits, of, this, mounting, are, worth, the, extra, weight, and, added, complexity, to, prevent, damage, to, the, rope, from, rust, flakes, as, well, as, for, aesthetic, reasons, the, rings, are, often, wrapped, with, strips, of, colored, cloth, factory, made, djembes, often, from, synthetic, materials, such, as, fiberglass, use, a, similar, system, however, instead, of, by, vertical, ropes, the, top, ring, is, pulled, against, the, flesh, ring, by, mechanical, lugs, that, are, tightened, with, a, wrench, after, initial, tightening, of, the, verticals, a, djembe, is, tuned, by, creating, twists, in, the, verticals, to, shorten, them, mali, weave, with, more, than, one, completed, row, of, twists, the, vertical, rope, forms, diamond, shapes, that, can, be, quite, decorative, well, applied, mali, weave, keeps, the, rope, that, runs, across, the, verticals, horizontal, without, gradually, climbing, up, in, a, spiral, pattern, the, amount, of, tension, that, can, be, applied, this, way, is, considerable, a, djembe, tuned, to, solo, pitch, has, a, tone, frequency, of, around, 400, hz, for, a, drum, with, a, 31, cm, 12, 2, in, playing, surface, this, equates, to, an, overall, pull, force, of, around, 455, kg, 1, 000, lb, or, 15, 000, newton, per, meter, n, m, of, tension, instead, of, trimming, the, skin, off, above, the, crown, ring, the, drum, maker, can, fold, the, skin, over, so, it, covers, the, crown, ring, this, is, done, for, aesthetic, purposes, the, fold, over, does, not, serve, to, hold, the, skin, in, place, djembefolas, frequently, attach, one, to, four, metal, rattles, to, their, drum, known, as, sege, sege, malink, or, sesse, susu, also, called, ksink, ksink, the, rattles, serve, as, decoration, as, well, as, to, create, a, richer, sound, sege, sege, are, not, a, status, symbol, or, indicative, of, playing, skill, anyone, can, attach, sege, sege, to, their, djembe, regardless, of, their, ability, or, whom, they, are, playing, with, without, causing, offence, or, breaking, etiquette, ropes, of, different, color, can, be, wrapped, around, the, bowl, of, the, drum, as, decoration, to, tune, the, drum, the, rope, wrap, must, be, removed, djembes, may, also, be, decorated, with, cowrie, shells, coloured, paint, decorative, tacks, or, other, metalwork, traditionally, carvings, on, djembes, if, any, are, limited, to, the, foot, depending, on, the, country, of, origin, different, patterns, are, used, traditional, carving, styles, are, usually, quite, plain, and, restrained, in, the, 2000s, western, demand, and, competition, among, carvers, resulted, in, more, and, more, elaborate, carvings, that, can, cover, all, of, the, foot, and, in, some, cases, include, the, bowl, of, the, drum, particularly, in, guinea, drum, makers, often, fit, motorcycle, tires, to, the, foot, of, a, djembe, both, for, decoration, and, to, prevent, the, drum, from, slipping, when, playing, seated, on, a, slippery, floor, this, trend, started, in, the, late, 1990s, and, evolved, from, the, practice, of, attaching, timing, belts, to, the, foot, of, djembes, as, a, decoration, traditionally, as, today, in, africa, an, individual, needs, to, spend, many, years, accompanying, his, master, in, ceremonies, and, other, festivities, before, becoming, a, real, djembefola, djembe, player, today, in, the, communities, of, western, civilization, learning, to, play, the, djembe, generally, involves, finding, a, master, drummer, and, having, private, lessons, or, lessons, for, small, groups, of, people, players, generally, need, to, learn, the, basic, sounds, and, traditional, rhythm, samples, 4, 4, and, 12, 8, to, be, able, to, follow, classes, many, years, of, playing, and, learning, are, needed, to, be, able, to, produce, a, sound, that, is, comparable, in, its, quality, to, that, of, a, master, drummer, written, transcriptions, of, rhythms, tend, to, be, imprecise, usually, only, the, basic, idea, of, the, rhythm, is, transcribed, but, the, real, feeling, that, it, carries, can, t, be, easily, put, down, on, paper, this, is, due, to, the, nature, of, the, west, african, music, the, different, types, of, swing, at, least, four, of, them, that, are, not, easily, expressible, with, western, notation, for, this, reason, written, material, for, advanced, players, is, still, scarce, if, not, unavailable, while, general, and, informational, literature, can, be, easily, obtained, with, the, advent, of, musical, software, such, as, percussion, studio, transcribing, and, reproducing, rhythms, has, become, easier, musical, software, can, be, useful, for, people, who, don, t, have, a, group, to, practice, with, as, individual, tracks, can, be, isolated, or, tempo, changed, to, assist, with, playing, along, and, learning, practising, a, competent, user, is, able, to, reproduce, material, learnt, in, a, workshop, for, later, use, notwithstanding, its, utility, as, a, basic, transcription, tool, percussion, studio, cannot, reproduce, the, intonation, and, microtiming, of, a, skilled, player, and, has, limited, value, therefore, for, transcribing, solo, the, drum, machine, software, hydrogen, software, contains, djembe, dunun, and, bell, sound, files, that, can, be, used, to, study, as, described, above
