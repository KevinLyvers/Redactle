chinese, architecture, is, the, embodiment, of, an, architectural, style, that, has, developed, over, millennia, in, china, and, has, influenced, architecture, throughout, east, asia, since, its, emergence, during, the, early, ancient, era, the, structural, principles, of, its, architecture, have, remained, largely, unchanged, the, main, changes, involved, diverse, decorative, details, starting, with, the, tang, dynasty, chinese, architecture, has, had, a, major, influence, on, the, architectural, styles, of, neighbouring, east, asian, countries, such, as, japan, korea, vietnam, and, mongolia, in, addition, to, minor, influences, on, the, architecture, of, southeast, and, south, asia, including, the, countries, of, malaysia, singapore, indonesia, sri, lanka, thailand, laos, cambodia, and, the, philippines, chinese, architecture, is, characterized, by, bilateral, symmetry, use, of, enclosed, open, spaces, feng, shui, e, g, directional, hierarchies, a, horizontal, emphasis, and, an, allusion, to, various, cosmological, mythological, or, in, general, symbolic, elements, chinese, architecture, traditionally, classifies, structures, according, to, type, ranging, from, pagodas, to, palaces, due, to, the, frequent, use, of, wood, a, relatively, perishable, material, as, well, as, few, monumental, structures, built, of, more, durable, materials, much, historical, knowledge, of, chinese, architecture, derives, from, surviving, miniature, models, in, ceramic, and, published, diagrams, and, specifications, although, unifying, aspects, exist, chinese, architecture, varies, widely, based, on, status, or, affiliation, such, as, whether, the, structures, were, constructed, for, emperors, commoners, or, for, religious, purposes, other, variations, in, chinese, architecture, are, shown, in, vernacular, styles, associated, with, different, geographic, regions, and, different, ethnic, heritages, the, architecture, of, china, is, as, old, as, chinese, civilization, from, every, source, of, information, literary, graphic, exemplary, there, is, strong, evidence, testifying, to, the, fact, that, the, chinese, have, always, enjoyed, an, indigenous, system, of, construction, that, has, retained, its, principal, characteristics, from, prehistoric, times, to, the, present, day, over, the, vast, area, from, chinese, turkistan, to, japan, from, manchuria, to, the, northern, half, of, french, indochina, the, same, system, of, construction, is, prevalent, and, this, was, the, area, of, chinese, cultural, influence, that, this, system, of, construction, could, perpetuate, itself, for, more, than, four, thousand, years, over, such, a, vast, territory, and, still, remain, a, living, architecture, retaining, its, principal, characteristics, in, spite, of, repeated, foreign, invasions, military, intellectual, and, spiritual, is, a, phenomenon, comparable, only, to, the, continuity, of, the, civilization, of, which, it, is, an, integral, part, in, more, recent, times, china, has, become, the, most, rapidly, modernizing, country, in, the, world, in, the, past, few, decades, cities, like, shanghai, have, completely, changed, their, skyline, with, some, of, the, worlds, tallest, skyscrapers, dotting, the, horizon, china, also, has, one, of, the, most, extensive, high, speed, rail, networks, connecting, and, allowing, its, large, population, to, travel, more, efficiently, throughout, the, 20th, century, chinese, architects, have, attempted, to, bring, traditional, chinese, designs, into, modern, architecture, moreover, the, pressure, for, urban, development, throughout, china, requires, high, speed, construction, and, a, greater, floor, area, ratio, thus, in, cities, the, demand, for, traditional, chinese, buildings, which, are, normally, less, than, 3, levels, has, declined, in, favor, of, high, rises, however, the, traditional, skills, of, chinese, architecture, including, major, and, minor, carpentry, masonry, and, stonemasonry, are, used, in, the, construction, of, vernacular, architecture, in, china, s, rural, areas, chinese, civilizations, and, cultures, developed, in, the, plains, along, china, s, numerous, rivers, that, emptied, into, bohai, and, hongzhow, bays, the, most, prominent, of, these, rivers, the, yellow, and, the, yangtze, hosted, many, villages, the, climate, was, warmer, and, more, humid, than, today, allowing, millet, to, be, grown, in, the, north, and, rice, in, the, south, however, chinese, civilization, has, no, single, origin, instead, it, featured, a, gradual, multinuclear, development, between, 4000, and, 2000, bc, from, village, communities, to, what, anthropologists, call, cultures, to, states, two, of, the, more, important, cultures, were, hongshan, culture, 4700, 2900, bc, to, the, north, of, bohai, bay, in, inner, mongolia, and, hebei, province, and, contemporaneous, yangshao, culture, 5000, 3000, bc, in, henan, province, between, the, two, and, developing, later, was, longshan, culture, 3000, 2000, bc, in, the, central, and, lower, yellow, river, valley, these, combined, areas, gave, rise, to, thousands, of, small, proto, states, by, 3000, bc, some, shared, a, common, ritual, center, that, linked, them, to, a, single, symbolic, order, but, others, developed, more, independently, the, emergence, of, walled, cities, during, this, time, is, a, clear, indication, that, the, political, landscape, was, often, unstable, the, hongshan, culture, of, inner, mongolia, located, along, the, laoha, yingjin, and, daling, rivers, that, empty, into, bohai, bay, was, scattered, over, a, large, area, but, had, a, single, common, ritual, center, of, at, least, 14, burial, mounds, and, altars, over, several, ridges, it, is, dated, to, around, 3500, bc, or, possibly, earlier, although, no, evidence, suggests, village, settlements, nearby, its, size, is, much, larger, than, one, clan, or, village, could, support, in, other, words, though, rituals, would, have, been, performed, there, for, the, elites, the, large, area, implies, that, audiences, for, the, ritual, would, have, encompassed, all, the, villages, of, the, hongshan, as, a, sacred, landscape, the, center, might, have, attracted, supplicants, from, even, further, afield, rammed, earth, construction, was, both, practically, and, ideologically, important, during, the, rapid, construction, of, the, daqing, oil, field, and, the, related, development, of, daqing, 55, the, daqing, spirit, represented, deep, personal, commitment, in, pursuing, national, goals, self, sufficient, and, frugal, living, and, urban, rural, integrated, land, use, 3, daqing, s, urban, rural, landscape, was, said, to, embody, the, ideal, communist, society, described, by, karl, marx, because, it, eliminated, 1, the, gap, between, town, and, country, 2, the, gap, between, workers, and, peasants, and, 3, the, gap, between, manual, and, mental, labor, 3, drawing, on, the, daqing, experience, china, encouraged, rammed, earth, construction, in, the, mid, 1960s, 55, starting, in, 1964, mao, zedong, advocated, for, a, mass, design, revolution, movement, 55, in, the, context, of, the, sino, soviet, split, mao, urged, that, planners, should, avoid, the, use, of, soviet, style, prefabricated, materials, and, instead, embrace, the, proletarian, spirit, of, on, site, construction, using, rammed, earth, 55, the, communist, party, promoted, the, use, of, rammed, earth, construction, as, a, low, cost, method, which, was, indigenous, to, china, and, required, little, technical, skill, 55, reinforced, concrete, brick, infill, and, prefabricated, materials, were, used, increasingly, following, the, wall, reform, movement, of, 1973, 1976, and, were, promoted, in, publications, such, as, architectural, journal, 56, in, 2014, the, city, of, datong, started, to, rebuild, the, datong, ancient, city, wall, and, buildings, in, traditional, architecture, although, received, skepticism, and, opposition, by, citizens, by, then, many, praised, the, mayor, for, bringing, back, traditional, chinese, aesthetics, later, on, vernacular, chinese, architecture, shows, variations, related, to, local, terrain, and, climate, an, important, feature, in, chinese, architecture, is, its, emphasis, on, articulation, and, bilateral, symmetry, which, there, signifies, balance, these, are, found, everywhere, in, chinese, architecture, from, palace, complexes, to, humble, farmhouses, secondary, elements, are, positioned, on, either, side, of, the, main, structures, as, wings, to, maintain, overall, symmetry, buildings, are, typically, planned, to, contain, an, even, number, of, columns, to, produce, an, odd, number, of, bays, placing, the, main, door, in, the, center, bay, maintains, symmetry, in, contrast, to, buildings, chinese, gardens, tend, to, be, asymmetrical, gardens, are, designed, to, provide, enduring, flow, the, design, of, the, classic, chinese, garden, is, based, on, the, ideology, of, nature, and, man, in, one, as, opposed, to, the, home, itself, which, shows, the, human, sphere, co, existing, with, but, separate, from, nature, the, intent, is, that, people, feel, surrounded, by, and, in, harmony, with, nature, the, two, essential, garden, elements, are, stones, and, water, the, stones, signify, the, pursuit, of, immortality, while, water, represents, emptiness, and, existence, the, mountain, belongs, to, yang, static, beauty, and, the, water, belongs, to, yin, dynamic, wonder, they, depend, on, each, other, and, complete, each, other, in, much, chinese, architecture, buildings, or, building, complexes, surround, open, spaces, these, enclosed, spaces, come, in, two, forms, these, enclosures, aid, in, temperature, regulation, and, in, ventilation, northern, courtyards, are, typically, open, and, face, south, to, allow, the, maximum, exposure, of, the, building, windows, and, walls, to, the, sun, while, keeping, out, the, cold, north, winds, southern, sky, wells, are, relatively, small, and, collect, rainwater, from, the, roof, tops, they, perform, the, same, duties, as, the, roman, impluvium, while, restricting, the, amount, of, sunlight, that, enters, the, building, sky, wells, also, vent, hot, air, skyward, which, draws, cool, air, from, the, lower, areas, and, the, outside, the, projected, hierarchy, and, importance, and, building, uses, in, chinese, architecture, are, based, on, the, strict, placement, of, buildings, in, a, property, complex, buildings, with, doors, facing, the, front, of, the, property, are, considered, more, important, than, those, facing, the, sides, buildings, facing, away, from, the, front, are, the, least, important, south, facing, buildings, in, the, rear, and, more, private, areas, with, higher, exposure, to, sunlight, are, held, in, higher, esteem, and, reserved, for, elders, or, ancestral, plaques, buildings, facing, east, and, west, are, generally, for, junior, members, or, branches, of, the, family, while, buildings, near, the, front, are, typically, for, servants, and, hired, help, front, facing, buildings, in, the, back, of, properties, are, used, for, celebratory, rites, and, for, the, placement, of, ancestral, halls, and, plaques, in, multi, courtyard, complexes, central, courtyards, and, their, buildings, are, considered, more, important, than, peripheral, ones, the, latter, typically, for, storage, servants, rooms, or, kitchens, classical, chinese, buildings, especially, those, of, the, wealthy, are, built, with, an, emphasis, on, breadth, and, less, on, height, featuring, an, enclosed, heavy, platform, and, a, large, roof, that, floats, over, this, base, with, the, vertical, walls, deemphasized, buildings, that, were, too, high, and, large, were, considered, unsightly, and, therefore, generally, avoided, chinese, architecture, stresses, the, visual, impact, of, the, width, of, the, buildings, using, sheer, scale, to, inspire, awe, this, preference, contrasts, with, western, architecture, which, tends, to, emphasize, height, and, depth, this, often, meant, that, pagodas, towered, above, other, buildings, the, halls, and, palaces, in, the, forbidden, city, have, rather, low, ceilings, when, compared, to, equivalent, stately, buildings, in, the, west, but, their, external, appearance, suggests, the, all, embracing, nature, of, imperial, china, these, ideas, have, found, their, way, into, modern, western, architecture, for, example, through, the, work, of, j, rn, utzon, chinese, architecture, used, concepts, from, chinese, cosmology, such, as, feng, shui, geomancy, and, taoism, to, organize, construction, and, layout, these, include, the, use, of, certain, colors, numbers, and, the, cardinal, directions, reflected, the, belief, in, a, type, of, immanence, where, the, nature, of, a, thing, could, be, wholly, contained, in, its, own, form, beijing, and, chang, an, are, examples, of, traditional, chinese, town, planning, that, represent, these, cosmological, concepts, the, types, of, chinese, architecture, may, relate, to, the, use, of, the, structures, such, as, whether, they, were, built, for, royals, commoners, or, the, religious, due, to, primarily, wooden, construction, and, poor, maintenance, far, fewer, examples, of, commoner, s, homes, survive, compared, to, those, of, nobles, korman, claimed, the, average, commoner, s, home, did, not, change, much, even, centuries, after, the, establishment, of, the, universal, style, early, 20th, century, homes, were, similar, to, late, and, mid, imperial, homes, these, homes, tended, to, follow, a, set, pattern, the, center, of, the, building, was, a, shrine, for, deities, and, ancestors, and, was, also, used, during, festivities, on, its, two, sides, were, bedrooms, for, elders, the, two, wings, known, as, guardian, dragons, were, for, junior, members, as, well, as, the, living, room, the, dining, room, and, the, kitchen, although, sometimes, the, living, room, was, close, to, the, center, sometimes, the, extended, families, became, so, large, that, one, or, two, extra, pairs, of, wings, had, to, be, built, this, produced, a, u, shape, with, a, courtyard, suitable, e, g, for, farm, work, merchants, and, bureaucrats, preferred, to, close, off, the, front, with, an, imposing, gate, all, buildings, were, legally, regulated, and, the, law, required, that, the, number, of, stories, the, length, of, the, building, and, the, building, colours, reflect, the, owner, s, class, some, commoners, living, in, areas, plagued, by, bandits, built, communal, fortresses, called, tulou, for, protection, often, favoured, by, the, hakka, in, fujian, and, jiangxi, the, design, of, tulou, shows, the, ancient, philosophy, of, harmony, between, people, and, environment, people, used, local, materials, often, building, the, walls, with, rammed, earth, no, window, reached, the, outside, on, the, lower, two, floors, for, defense, but, the, inside, included, a, common, courtyard, and, let, people, gather, certain, architectural, features, were, reserved, for, buildings, built, for, the, emperor, of, china, one, example, is, the, use, of, yellow, the, imperial, color, roof, tiles, yellow, tiles, still, adorn, most, of, the, buildings, within, the, forbidden, city, only, the, emperor, could, use, hip, roofs, with, all, four, sides, sloping, the, two, types, of, hip, roof, were, single, eave, and, double, eave, the, hall, of, supreme, harmony, is, the, archetypal, example, of, double, eaves, the, temple, of, heaven, uses, blue, roof, tiles, to, symbolize, the, sky, the, roofs, are, almost, invariably, supported, by, brackets, dougong, a, feature, shared, only, with, the, largest, of, religious, buildings, the, building, s, wooden, columns, well, as, the, wall, surfaces, tend, to, be, red, black, is, often, used, in, pagodas, it, was, believed, that, the, gods, were, inspired, by, the, black, color, to, visit, earth, the, 5, clawed, dragon, adopted, by, the, hongwu, emperor, first, emperor, of, ming, dynasty, for, his, personal, use, was, used, to, decoration, the, beams, pillars, and, on, the, doors, on, imperial, architecture, curiously, the, dragon, was, never, used, on, roofs, of, imperial, buildings, only, buildings, used, by, the, imperial, family, were, allowed, to, have, nine, jian, space, between, two, columns, only, gates, used, by, the, emperor, could, have, five, arches, with, the, centre, one, reserved, for, the, emperor, the, ancient, chinese, favored, the, color, red, beijing, became, the, capital, of, china, after, the, mongol, invasion, of, the, 13th, century, completing, the, easterly, migration, of, the, chinese, capital, begun, in, the, jin, dynasty, the, ming, uprising, in, 1368, reasserted, chinese, authority, and, fixed, beijing, as, the, seat, of, imperial, power, for, the, next, five, centuries, the, emperor, and, the, empress, lived, in, palaces, on, the, central, axis, of, the, forbidden, city, the, crown, prince, at, the, eastern, side, and, the, concubines, at, the, back, the, imperial, concubines, were, often, referred, to, as, the, back, palace, three, thousand, during, the, mid, qing, dynasty, the, emperor, s, residence, was, moved, to, the, western, side, of, the, complex, it, is, misleading, to, speak, of, an, axis, in, the, western, sense, of, a, visual, perspective, ordering, facades, the, chinese, axis, is, a, line, of, privilege, usually, built, upon, regulating, access, instead, of, vistas, a, series, of, gates, and, pavilions, are, used, numerology, influenced, imperial, architecture, hence, the, use, of, nine, the, greatest, single, digit, number, in, much, of, construction, and, the, reason, why, the, forbidden, city, in, beijing, is, said, to, have, 9, 999, 9, rooms, just, short, of, heaven, s, mythical, 10, 000, rooms, the, importance, of, the, east, the, direction, of, the, rising, sun, in, orienting, and, siting, imperial, buildings, is, a, form, of, solar, worship, found, in, many, ancient, cultures, reflecting, the, affiliation, of, ruler, with, the, sun, the, tombs, and, mausoleums, of, imperial, family, members, such, as, the, 8th, century, tang, dynasty, tombs, at, the, qianling, mausoleum, can, be, counted, as, part, of, the, imperial, tradition, these, above, ground, earthen, mounds, and, pyramids, had, subterranean, shaft, and, vault, structures, that, were, lined, with, brick, walls, since, at, least, the, warring, states, period, 481, 221, bc, generally, speaking, buddhist, architecture, follows, the, imperial, style, a, large, buddhist, monastery, normally, has, a, front, hall, housing, the, statues, of, the, four, heavenly, kings, followed, by, a, great, hall, housing, statues, of, the, buddhas, accommodations, are, located, at, the, two, sides, some, of, the, greatest, examples, of, this, come, from, the, 18th, century, puning, temple, and, putuo, zongcheng, temple, buddhist, monasteries, sometimes, also, have, pagodas, which, may, house, relics, of, the, gautama, buddha, older, pagodas, tend, to, be, four, sided, while, later, pagodas, usually, have, eight, sides, daoist, architecture, usually, follows, the, commoners, style, the, main, entrance, is, however, usually, at, the, side, out, of, superstition, about, demons, that, might, try, to, enter, the, premise, see, feng, shui, in, contrast, to, the, buddhists, in, a, daoist, temple, the, main, deity, is, located, in, the, main, hall, at, the, front, with, lesser, deities, in, the, back, hall, and, at, the, sides, this, is, because, chinese, people, believe, that, even, after, the, body, has, died, the, soul, is, still, alive, from, the, han, grave, design, it, shows, the, forces, of, cosmic, yin, yang, the, two, forces, from, the, heaven, and, earth, that, create, eternity, the, tallest, pre, modern, building, in, china,

this, focal, point, served, as, what, buddhist, call, a, pagoda, which, is, a, symbol, of, the, buddha, and, his, death, the, layout, of, such, tombs, has, the, corpse, in, the, back, chamber, as, the, pillar, location, indicated, the, buddha, s, death, there, would, sometimes, be, interior, tomb, decoration, to, portray, immortal, or, divine, meaning, dome, ceilings, in, the, 4th, and, 7th, centuries, were, representations, of, the, heavens, this, originates, from, roman, provincial, art, and, ancient, egypt, as, most, of, these, representations, are, circular, other, forms, are, present, dodecagon, octagonal, and, square, many, caves, in, the, 4th, 7th, centuries, were, probably, carved, throughout, the, han, and, tang, period, chinese, urban, planning, is, based, on, fengshui, geomancy, and, the, well, field, system, of, land, division, both, used, since, the, neolithic, age, the, basic, well, field, diagram, is, overlaid, with, the, luoshu, a, magic, square, divided, into, 9, sub, squares, and, linked, with, chinese, numerology, in, southern, song, dynasty, 1131ad, the, design, of, hongcun, city, in, anhui, was, based, around, harmony, between, man, and,

form, of, material, self, defense, wood, was, typically, utilised, as, a, primary, building, material, also, chinese, culture, holds, that, life, connects, with, nature, and, that, humans, should, interact, with, animated, things, by, contrast, stone, was, associated, with, the, homes, of, the, dead, however, unlike, other, building, materials, wooden, structures, are, less, durable, the, songyue, pagoda, built, in, 523, is, china, s, oldest, extant, pagoda, its, use, of, brick, instead, of, wood, allowed, it, to, endure, across, the, centuries, from, the, tang, dynasty, 618, 907, onwards, brick, and, stone, architecture, gradually, became, more, common, the, earliest, examples, of, this, transition, can, be, seen, in, building, projects, such, as, the, zhaozhou, bridge, completed, in, 605, or, the, xumi, pagoda, built, in, 636, some, stone, and, brick, architecture, was, used, in, subterranean, tomb, architecture, of, earlier, dynasties, in, the, early, 20th,
