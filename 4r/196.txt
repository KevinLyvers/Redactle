was, indeed, special, because, she, was, the, object, of, the, prince, s, love, and, time, he, had, tamed, her, and, now, she, was, more, precious, than, all, of, the, other, roses, upon, their,

bids, a, farewell, to, the, narrator, and, states, that, if, it, looks, as, though, he, has, died, it, is, only, because, his, body, was, too, heavy, to, take, with, him, to, his, planet, the, prince,

memory, of, his, small, friend, a, memorial, to, the, prince, not, just, to, the, prince, but, also, to, the, time, the, prince, and, the, narrator, had, together, the, little, prince, was, created, when, saint, exup, ry, was, an, ex, patriate, and, distraught, about, what, was, going, on, in, his, country, and, in, the, world, according, to, one, analysis, the, story, of, the, little, prince, features, a, lot, of, fantastical, unrealistic, elements, you, can, t, ride, a, flock, of, birds, to, another, planet, the, fantasy, of, the, little, prince, works, because, the, logic, of, the, story, is, based, on, the, imagination, of, children, rather, than, the, strict, realism, of, adults, an, exquisite, literary, perfectionist, akin, to, the, 19th, century, french, poet, st, phane, mallarm, saint, exup, ry, produced, draft, pages, covered, with, fine, lines, of, handwriting, much, of, it, painstakingly, crossed, out, with, one, word, left, standing, where, there, were, a, hundred, words, one, sentence, substitut, for, a, page, he, worked, long, hours, with, great, concentration, according, to, the, author, himself, it, was, extremely, difficult, to, start, his, creative, writing, processes, biographer, paul, webster, wrote, of, the, aviator, author, s, style, behind, saint, exup, ry, s, quest, for, perfection, was, a, laborious, process, of, editing, and, rewriting, which, reduced, original, drafts, by, as, much, as, two, thirds, the, french, author, frequently, wrote, at, night, usually, starting, at, about, 11, p, m, accompanied, by, a, tray, of, strong, black, coffee, in, 1942, saint, exup, ry, related, to, his, american, english, teacher, ad, le, breaux, that, at, such, a, time, of, night, he, felt, free, and, able, to, concentrate, writing, for, hours, without, feeling, tired, or, sleepy, until, he, instantaneously, dozed, off, he, would, wake, up, later, in, daylight, still, at, his, desk, with, his, head, on, his, arms, saint, exup, ry, stated, it, was, the, only, way, he, could, work, as, once, he, started, a, writing, project, it, became, an, obsession, a, native, speaker, of, french, saint, exup, ry, was, never, able, to, achieve, anything, more, than, haltingly, poor, english, ad, le, breaux, his, young, northport, english, tutor, to, whom, he, later, dedicated, a, writing, for, miss, ad, le, breaux, who, so, gently, guided, me, in, the, mysteries, of, the, english, language, related, her, experiences, with, her, famous, student, as, saint, exup, ry, in, america, 1942, 1943, a, memoir, published, in, 1971, saint, exup, ry, s, prodigious, writings, and, studies, of, literature, sometimes, gripped, him, and, on, occasion, he, continued, his, readings, of, literary, works, until, moments, before, take, off, on, solitary, military, reconnaissance, flights, as, he, was, adept, at, both, reading, and, writing, while, flying, taking, off, with, an, open, book, balanced, on, his, leg, his, ground, crew, would, fear, his, mission, would, quickly, end, after, contacting, something, very, hard, on, one, flight, to, the, chagrin, of, colleagues, awaiting, his, arrival, he, circled, the, tunis, airport, for, an, hour, so, that, he, could, finish, reading, a, novel, saint, exup, ry, frequently, flew, with, a, lined, carnet, notebook, during, his, long, solo, flights, and, some, of, his, philosophical, writings, were, created, during, such, periods, when, he, could, reflect, on, the, world, below, him, becoming, enmeshed, in, a, search, for, ideals, which, he, translated, into, fable, and, parable, in, the, little, prince, its, narrator, the, pilot, talks, of, being, stranded, in, the, desert, beside, his, crashed, aircraft, the, account, clearly, drew, on, saint, exup, ry, s, own, experience, in, the, sahara, an, ordeal, described, in, detail, in, his, 1939, memoir, wind, sand, and, stars, original, french, terre, des, hommes, on, 30, december, 1935, at, 2, 45am, after, 19, hours, and, 44, minutes, in, the, air, saint, exup, ry, along, with, his, copilot, navigator, andr, pr, vot, crashed, in, the, sahara, desert, they, were, attempting, to, break, the, speed, record, for, a, paris, to, saigon, flight, in, a, then, popular, type, of, air, race, called, a, raid, that, had, a, prize, of, 150, 000, francs, their, plane, was, a, caudron, c, 630, simoun, and, the, crash, site, is, thought, to, have, been, near, to, the, wadi, natrun, valley, close, to, the, nile, delta, both, miraculously, survived, the, crash, only, to, face, rapid, dehydration, in, the, intense, desert, heat, their, maps, were, primitive, and, ambiguous, lost, among, the, sand, dunes, with, a, few, grapes, a, thermos, of, coffee, a, single, orange, and, some, wine, the, pair, had, only, one, day, s, worth, of, liquid, they, both, began, to, see, mirages, which, were, quickly, followed, by, more, vivid, hallucinations, by, the, second, and, third, days, they, were, so, dehydrated, that, they, stopped, sweating, altogether, finally, on, the, fourth, day, a, bedouin, on, a, camel, discovered, them, and, administered, a, native, rehydration, treatment, which, saved, saint, exup, ry, s, and, pr, vot, s, lives, in, the, novella, the, fox, believed, to, be, modelled, after, the, author, s, intimate, new, york, city, friend, silvia, hamilton, reinhardt, tells, the, prince, that, his, rose, is, unique, and, special, as, she, is, the, one, he, loves, the, novella, s, iconic, phrase, one, sees, clearly, only, with, the, heart, is, believed, to, have, been, suggested, by, reinhardt, the, fearsome, grasping, baobab, trees, researchers, have, contended, were, meant, to, represent, nazism, attempting, to, destroy, the, planet, the, little, prince, s, reassurance, to, the, pilot, that, the, prince, s, body, is, only, an, empty, shell, resembles, the, last, words, of, antoine, s, dying, younger, brother, fran, ois, who, told, the, author, from, his, deathbed, don, t, worry, i, m, all, right, i, can, t, help, it, it, s, my, body, many, researchers, believe, that, the, prince, s, kindhearted, but, petulant, and, vain, rose, was, inspired, by, saint, exup, ry, s, salvadoran, wife, consuelo, de, saint, exup, ry, with, the, small, home, planet, being, inspired, by, el, salvador, where, he, crashed, and, stayed, to, recover, while, being, within, view, of, 3, volcanoes, one, of, which, was, ilamatepec, also, known, as, the, santa, ana, volcano, despite, a, tumultuous, marriage, saint, exup, ry, kept, consuelo, close, to, his, heart, and, portrayed, her, as, the, prince, s, rose, whom, he, tenderly, protects, with, a, wind, screen, and, places, under, a, glass, dome, on, his, tiny, planet, saint, exup, ry, s, infidelity, and, the, doubts, of, his, marriage, are, symbolized, by, the, vast, field, of, roses, the, prince, encounters, during, his, visit, to, earth, this, interpretation, was, described, by, biographer, paul, webster, who, stated, she, was, the, muse, to, whom, saint, exup, ry, poured, out, his, soul, in, copious, letters, consuelo, was, the, rose, in, the, little, prince, i, should, have, judged, her, by, her, acts, and, not, by, her, words, says, the, prince, she, wrapped, herself, around, me, and, enlightened, me, i, should, never, have, fled, i, should, have, guessed, at, the, tenderness, behind, her, poor, ruses, saint, exup, ry, probably, has, drawn, inspiration, for, the, prince, s, character, and, appearance, from, his, own, self, as, a, youth, as, during, his, early, years, friends, and, family, called, him, le, roi, soleil, the, sun, king, because, of, his, golden, curly, hair, the, author, had, also, met, a, precocious, eight, year, old, with, curly, blond, hair, while, he, was, residing, with, a, family, in, quebec, city, in, 1942, thomas, de, koninck, the, son, of, philosopher, charles, de, koninck, another, possible, inspiration, for, the, little, prince, has, been, suggested, as, land, morrow, lindbergh, the, young, golden, haired, son, of, fellow, aviator, charles, lindbergh, and, his, wife, anne, morrow, lindbergh, whom, he, met, during, an, overnight, stay, at, their, long, island, home, in, 1939, some, have, seen, the, prince, as, a, christ, figure, as, the, child, is, sin, free, and, believes, in, a, life, after, death, subsequently, returning, to, his, personal, heaven, when, life, photojournalist, john, phillips, questioned, the, author, aviator, on, his, inspiration, for, the, child, character, saint, exup, ry, told, him, that, one, day, he, looked, down, on, what, he, thought, was, a, blank, sheet, and, saw, a, small, childlike, figure, i, asked, him, who, he, was, he, replied, i, m, the, little, prince, was, the, reply, one, of, saint, exup, ry, s, earliest, literary, references, to, a, small, prince, is, to, be, found, in, his, second, news, dispatch, from, moscow, dated, 14, may, 1935, in, his, writings, as, a, special, correspondent, for, paris, soir, the, author, described, traveling, from, france, to, the, soviet, union, by, train, late, at, night, during, the, trip, he, ventured, from, his, first, class, accommodation, into, the, third, class, carriages, where, he, came, upon, large, groups, of, polish, families, huddled, together, returning, to, their, homeland, his, commentary, not, only, described, a, diminutive, prince, but, also, touched, on, several, other, themes, saint, exup, ry, incorporated, into, various, philosophical, writings, i, sat, down, couple, between, the, man, and, the, woman, a, child, had, hollowed, himself, out, a, place, and, fallen, asleep, he, turned, in, his, slumber, and, in, the, dim, lamplight, i, saw, his, face, what, an, adorable, face, a, golden, fruit, had, been, born, of, these, two, peasants, this, is, a, musician, s, face, i, told, myself, this, is, the, child, mozart, this, is, a, life, full, of, beautiful, promise, little, princes, in, legends, are, not, different, from, this,

the, midst, of, personal, upheavals, and, failing, health, he, produced, almost, half, of, the, writings, for, which, he, would, be, remembered, including, a, tender, tale, of, loneliness, friendship, love, and, loss, in, the, form, of, a, young, prince, visiting, earth, an, earlier, memoir, by, the, author, recounted, his, aviation, experiences, in, the, sahara, and, he, is, thought, to, have,

in, the, political, quarrels, that, set, frenchman, against, frenchman, however, the, period, was, to, be, both, a, dark, but, productive, time, during, which, he, created, three, important, works,

principally, in, the, long, island, north, shore, community, of, asharoken, in, mid, to, late, 1942, with, the, manuscript, being, completed, in, october, although, the, book, was, started, in, his,

of, his, illustrations, were, painted, on, the, wrong, side, of, the, delicate, onion, skin, paper, that, he, used, as, his, medium, of, choice, as, with, some, of, his, draft, manuscripts, he,

on, a, multitude, of, appearances, engaged, in, a, variety, of, tasks, some, appeared, as, doll, like, figures, baby, puffins, angels, with, wings, and, even, a, figure, similar, to, that, in, robert,

he, later, gave, a, similar, doodle, to, elizabeth, reynal, at, his, new, york, publisher, s, office, most, often, the, diminutive, figure, was, expressed, as, a, slip, of, a, boy, with, a, turned, up, nose, lots, of, hair, long, baggy, pants, that, were, too, short, for, him, and, with, a, long, scarf, that, whipped, in, the, wind, usually, the, boy, had, a, puzzled, expression, his, boy, saint, exup, ry, came, to, think, of, as, the, little, prince, and, he, was, usually, found, standing, on, top, of, a, tiny, planet, most, of, the, time, he, was, alone, sometimes, walking, up, a, path, sometimes, there, was, a, single, flower, on, the, planet, his, characters, were, frequently, seen, chasing, butterflies, when, asked, why, they, did, so, saint, exup, ry, who, thought, of, the, figures, as, his, alter, egos, replied, that, they, were, actually, pursuing, a, realistic, ideal, saint, exup, ry, eventually, settled, on, the, image, of, the, young, precocious, child, with, curly, blond, hair, an, image, which, would, become, the, subject, of, speculations, as, to, its, source, one, most, striking, illustration, depicted, the, pilot, narrator, asleep, beside, his, stranded, plane, prior, to, the, prince, s, arrival, although, images, of, the, narrator, were, created, for, the, story, none, survived, saint, exup, ry, s, editing, process, to, mark, both, the, 50th, and,

hamilton, gave, to, him, as, a, gift, may, have, been, the, model, for, the, story, s, desert, fox, and, its, tiger, a, museum, representative, stated, that, the, novella, s, final, drawings, were, lost, seven, unpublished, drawings, for, the, book, were, also, displayed, at, the, museum, s, exhibit, including, fearsome, looking, baobab, trees, ready, to, destroy, the, prince, s, home, asteroid, as, well, as, a, picture, of, the, story, s, narrator, the, forlorn, pilot, sleeping, next, to, his, aircraft, that, image, was, likely, omitted, to, avoid, giving, the, story, a, literalness, that, would, distract, its, readers, according, to, one, of, the, morgan, library, s, staff, according, to, christine, nelson, curator, of, literary, and, historical, manuscripts, at, the, morgan, he, image, evokes, saint, exup, ry, s, own, experience, of, awakening, in, an, isolated, mysterious, place, you, can, almost, imagine, him, wandering, without, much, food, and, water, and, conjuring, up, the, character, of, the, little, prince, another, reviewer, noted, that, the, author, chose, the, best, illustrations, to, maintain, the, ethereal, tone, he, wanted, his, story, to, exude, choosing, between, ambiguity, and, literal, text, and, illustrations, saint, exup, ry, chose, in, every, case, to, obfuscate, not, a, single, drawing, of, the, story, s, narrator, pilot, survived, the, author, s, editing, process, he, was, very, good, at, excising, what, was, not, essential, to, his, story, in, 2001, japanese, researcher, yoshitsugu, kunugiyama, surmised, that, the, cover, illustration, saint, exup, ry, painted, for, le, petit, prince, deliberately, depicted, a, stellar, arrangement, created, to, celebrate, the, author, s, own, centennial, of, birth, according, to, kunugiyama, the, cover, art, chosen, from, one, of, saint, exup, ry, s, watercolour, illustrations, contained, the, planets, saturn, and, jupiter, plus, the, star, aldebaran, arranged, as, an, isosceles, triangle, a, celestial, configuration, which, occurred, in, the, early, 1940s, and, which, he, likely, knew, would, next, reoccur, in, the, year, 2000, saint, exup, ry, possessed, superior, mathematical, skills, and, was, a, master, celestial, navigator, a, vocation, he, had, studied, at, salon, de, provence, with, the, arm, e, de, l, air, french, air, force, stacy, schiff, one, of, saint, exup, ry, s, principal, biographers, wrote, of, him, and, his, most, famous, work, rarely, have, an, author, and, a, character, been, so, intimately, bound, together, as, antoine, de, saint, exup, ry, and, his, little, prince, and, remarking, of, their, dual, fates, the, two, remain, tangled, together, twin, innocents, who, fell, from, the, sky, another, noted, that, the, novella, s, mystique, was, enhanced, by, the, parallel, between, author, and, subject, imperious, innocents, whose, lives, consist, of, equal, parts, flight, and, failed, love, who, fall, to, earth, are, little, impressed, with, what, they, find, here, and, ultimately, disappear, without, a, trace, only, weeks, after, his, novella, was, first, published, in, april, 1943, despite, his, wife, s, pleadings, and, before, saint, exup, ry, had, received, any, of, its, royalties, he, never, would, the, author, aviator, joined, the, free, french, forces, he, would, remain, immensely, proud, of, the, little, prince, and, almost, always, kept, a, personal, copy, with, him, which, he, often, read, to, others, during, the, war, as, part, of, a, 32, ship, military, convoy, he, voyaged, to, north, africa, where, he, rejoined, his, old, squadron, to, fight, with, the, allies, resuming, his, work, as, a, reconnaissance, pilot, despite, the, best, efforts, of, his, friends, colleagues, and, fellow, airmen, who, could, not, prevent, him, from, flying, he, had, previously, escaped, death, by, the, barest, of, margins, a, number, of, times, but, was, then, lost, in, action, during, a, july, 1944, spy, mission, from, the, moonscapes, of, corsica, to, the, continent, in, preparation, for, the, allied, invasion, of, occupied, france, only, three, weeks, before, the, liberation, of, paris, many, of, the, book, s, initial, reviewers, were, flummoxed, by, the, fable, s, multi, layered, story, line, and, its, morals, perhaps, expecting, a, significantly, more, conventional, story, from, one, of, france, s, leading, writers, its, publisher, had, anticipated, such, reactions, to, a, work, that, fell, neither, exclusively, into, a, children, s, nor, adults, literature, classification, the, new, york, times, reviewer, wrote, shortly, before, its, publication, what, makes, a, good, children, s, book, the, little, prince, which, is, a, fascinating, fable, for, grown, ups, of, conjectural, value, for, boys, and, girls, of, 6, 8, and, 10, may, very, well, be, a, book, on, the, order, of, gulliver, s, travels, something, that, exists, on, two, levels, can, you, clutter, up, a, narrative, with, paradox, and, irony, and, still, hold, the, interest, of, 8, and, 10, year, olds, notwithstanding, the, story, s, duality, the, review, added, that, major, portions, of, the, story, would, probably, still, capture, the, imagination, of, any, child, addressing, whether, it, was, written, for, children, or, adults, reynal, hitchcock, promoted, it, ambiguously, saying, that, as, far, as, they, were, concerned, it, s, the, new, book, by, saint, exup, ry, adding, to, its, dustcover, there, are, few, stories, which, in, some, way, in, some, degree, change, the, world, forever, for, their, readers, this, is, one, others, were, not, shy, in, offering, their, praise, austin, stevens, also, of, the, new, york, times, stated, that, the, story, possessed, large, portions, of, the, saint, exup, ry, philosophy, and, poetic, spirit, in, a, way, it, s, a, sort, of, credo, p, l, travers, author, of, the, mary, poppins, series, of, children, books, wrote, in, a, new, york, herald, tribune, review, the, little, prince, will, shine, upon, children, with, a, sidewise, gleam, it, will, strike, them, in, some, place, that, is, not, the, mind, and, glow, there, until, the, time, comes, for, them, to, comprehend, it, british, journalist, neil, clark, in, the, american, conservative, in, 2009, offered, an, expansive, view, of, saint, exup, ry, s, overall, work, by, commenting, that, it, provides, a, bird, s, eye, view, of, humanity, contains, some, of, the, most, profound, observations, on, the, human, condition, ever, written, and, that, the, author, s, novella, doesn, t, merely, express, his, contempt, for, selfishness, and, materialism, shows, how, life, should, be, lived, the, book, enjoyed, modest, initial, success, residing, on, the, new, york, times, best, seller, list, for, only,

regularly, draws, new, readers, and, reviewers, selling, almost, two, million, copies, annually, and, also, spawning, numerous, adaptations, modern, day, references, to, the, little, prince, include,

several, other, english, translations, her, translation, contained, some, errors, mistranslations, aside, one, reviewer, noted, that, wood, s, almost, poetic, english, translation, has, long, been, admired, by, many, little, prince, lovers, who, have, spanned, generations, it, stayed, in, print, until, 2001, as, her, work, maintains, saint, exup, ry, s, story, telling, spirit, and, charm, if,
