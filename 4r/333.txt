the, guitar, is, a, stringed, musical, instrument, that, is, usually, fretted, with, some, exceptions, and, typically, has, six, or, twelve, strings, it, is, usually, held, flat, against, the, player, s, body, and, played, by, strumming, or, plucking, the, strings, with, the, dominant, hand, while, simultaneously, pressing, selected, strings, against, frets, with, the, fingers, of, the, opposite, hand, a, guitar, pick, may, also, be, used, to, strike, the, strings, the, sound, of, the, guitar, is, projected, either, acoustically, by, means, of, a, resonant, hollow, chamber, on, the, guitar, or, amplified, by, an, electronic, pickup, and, an, amplifier, the, guitar, is, classified, as, a, chordophone, meaning, the, sound, is, produced, by, a, vibrating, string, stretched, between, two, fixed, points, historically, a, guitar, was, constructed, from, wood, with, its, strings, made, of, catgut, steel, guitar, strings, were, introduced, near, the, end, of, the, nineteenth, century, in, the, united, states, but, nylon, and, steel, strings, became, mainstream, only, following, world, war, ii, the, guitar, s, ancestors, include, the, gittern, the, vihuela, the, four, course, renaissance, guitar, and, the, five, course, baroque, guitar, all, of, which, contributed, to, the, development, of, the, modern, six, string, instrument, there, are, three, main, types, of, modern, guitar, the, classical, guitar, spanish, guitar, the, steel, string, acoustic, guitar, or, electric, guitar, and, the, hawaiian, guitar, played, across, the, player, s, lap, traditional, acoustic, guitars, include, the, flat, top, guitar, typically, with, a, large, sound, hole, or, the, archtop, guitar, which, is, sometimes, called, a, jazz, guitar, the, tone, of, an, acoustic, guitar, is, produced, by, the, strings, vibration, amplified, by, the, hollow, body, of, the, guitar, which, acts, as, a, resonating, chamber, the, classical, spanish, guitar, is, often, played, as, a, solo, instrument, using, a, comprehensive, fingerstyle, technique, where, each, string, is, plucked, individually, by, the, player, s, fingers, as, opposed, to, being, strummed, the, term, finger, picking, can, also, refer, to, a, specific, tradition, of, folk, blues, bluegrass, and, country, guitar, playing, in, the, united, states, electric, guitars, first, patented, in, 1937, use, a, pickup, and, amplifier, that, made, the, instrument, loud, enough, to, be, heard, but, also, enabled, manufacturing, guitars, with, a, solid, block, of, wood, needing, a, resonant, chamber, a, wide, array, of, electronic, effects, units, became, possible, including, reverb, and, distortion, or, overdrive, solid, body, guitars, began, to, dominate, the, guitar, market, during, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, they, are, less, prone, to, unwanted, acoustic, feedback, as, with, acoustic, guitars, there, are, a, number, of, types, of, electric, guitars, including, hollowbody, guitars, archtop, guitars, used, in, jazz, guitar, blues, and, rockabilly, and, solid, body, guitars, which, are, widely, used, in, rock, music, the, loud, amplified, sound, and, sonic, power, of, the, electric, guitar, played, through, a, guitar, amp, have, played, a, key, role, in, the, development, of, blues, and, rock, music, both, as, an, accompaniment, instrument, playing, riffs, and, chords, and, performing, guitar, solos, and, in, many, rock, subgenres, notably, heavy, metal, music, and, punk, rock, the, electric, guitar, has, had, a, major, influence, on, popular, culture, the, guitar, is, used, in, a, wide, variety, of, musical, genres, worldwide, it, is, recognized, as, a, primary, instrument, in, genres, such, as, blues, bluegrass, country, flamenco, folk, jazz, jota, ska, mariachi, metal, punk, funk, reggae, rock, grunge, soul, acoustic, music, disco, new, wave, new, age, adult, contemporary, music, and, pop, occasionally, used, as, a, sample, in, hip, hop, dubstep, or, trap, music, the, modern, word, guitar, and, its, antecedents, have, been, applied, to, a, wide, variety, of, chordophones, since, classical, times, sometimes, causing, confusion, the, english, word, guitar, the, german, gitarre, and, the, french, guitare, were, all, adopted, from, the, spanish, guitarra, which, comes, from, the, andalusian, arabic, q, th, rah, and, the, latin, cithara, which, in, turn, came, from, the, ancient, greek, this, greek, word, may, also, come, from, the, persian, word, sihtar, kithara, appears, in, the, bible, four, times, 1, cor, 14, 7, rev, 5, 8, 14, 2, and, 15, 2, and, is, usually, translated, into, english, as, harp, the, origins, of, the, modern, guitar, are, not, known, before, the, development, of, the, electric, guitar, and, the, use, of, synthetic, materials, a, guitar, was, defined, as, being, an, instrument, having, a, long, fretted, neck, flat, wooden, soundboard, ribs, and, a, flat, back, most, often, with, incurved, sides, the, term, is, used, to, refer, to, a, number, of, chordophones, that, were, developed, and, used, across, europe, beginning, in, the, 12th, century, and, later, in, the, americas, a, 3, 300, year, old, stone, carving, of, a, hittite, bard, playing, a, stringed, instrument, is, the, oldest, iconographic, representation, of, a, chordophone, and, clay, plaques, from, babylonia, show, people, playing, a, lute, like, instrument, which, is, similar, to, the, guitar, several, scholars, cite, varying, influences, as, antecedents, to, the, modern, guitar, although, the, development, of, the, earliest, guitar, is, lost, to, the, history, of, medieval, spain, two, instruments, are, commonly, claimed, as, influential, predecessors, the, four, string, oud, and, its, precursor, the, european, lute, the, former, was, brought, to, iberia, by, the, moors, in, the, 8th, century, it, has, often, been, assumed, that, the, guitar, is, a, development, of, the, lute, or, of, the, ancient, greek, kithara, however, many, scholars, consider, the, lute, an, offshoot, or, separate, line, of, development, which, did, not, influence, the, evolution, of, the, guitar, in, any, significant, way, at, least, two, instruments, called, guitars, were, in, use, in, spain, by, 1200, the, guitarra, latina, latin, guitar, and, the, so, called, guitarra, morisca, moorish, guitar, the, guitarra, morisca, had, a, rounded, back, a, wide, fingerboard, and, several, sound, holes, the, guitarra, latina, had, a, single, sound, hole, and, a, narrower, neck, by, the, 14th, century, the, qualifiers, moresca, or, morisca, and, latina, had, been, dropped, and, these, two, chordophones, were, simply, referred, to, as, guitars, the, spanish, vihuela, called, in, italian, the, viola, da, mano, a, guitar, like, instrument, of, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, is, widely, considered, to, have, been, the, single, most, important, influence, in, the, development, of, the, baroque, guitar, it, had, six, courses, usually, lute, like, tuning, in, fourths, and, a, guitar, like, body, although, early, representations, reveal, an, instrument, with, a, sharply, cut, waist, it, was, also, larger, than, the, contemporary, four, course, guitars, by, the, 16th, century, the, vihuela, s, construction, had, more, in, common, with, the, modern, guitar, with, its, curved, one, piece, ribs, than, with, the, viols, and, more, like, a, larger, version, of, the, contemporary, four, course, guitars, the, vihuela, enjoyed, only, a, relatively, short, period, of, popularity, in, spain, and, italy, during, an, era, dominated, elsewhere, in, europe, by, the, lute, the, last, surviving, published, music, for, the, instrument, appeared, in, 1576, meanwhile, the, five, course, baroque, guitar, which, was, documented, in, spain, from, the, middle, of, the, 16th, century, enjoyed, popularity, especially, in, spain, italy, and, france, from, the, late, 16th, century, to, the, mid, 18th, century, in, portugal, the, word, viola, referred, to, the, guitar, as, guitarra, meant, the, portuguese, guitar, a, variety, of, cittern, there, were, many, different, plucked, instruments, that, were, being, invented, and, used, in, europe, during, the, middle, ages, by, the, 16th, century, most, of, the, forms, of, guitar, had, fallen, off, to, never, be, seen, again, however, midway, through, the, 16th, century, the, five, course, guitar, was, established, it, was, not, a, straightforward, process, there, were, two, types, of, five, course, guitars, differing, in, the, location, of, the, major, third, and, in, the, interval, pattern, the, fifth, course, can, be, inferred, because, the, instrument, was, known, to, play, more, than, the, sixteen, notes, possible, with, four, the, guitar, s, strings, were, tuned, in, unison, so, in, other, words, it, was, tuned, by, placing, a, finger, on, the, second, fret, of, the, thinnest, string, and, tuning, the, guitar, bottom, to, top, the, strings, were, a, whole, octave, apart, from, one, another, which, is, the, reason, for, the, different, method, of, tuning, because, it, was, so, different, there, was, major, controversy, as, to, who, created, the, five, course, guitar, a, literary, source, lope, de, vega, s, dorotea, gives, the, credit, to, the, poet, and, musician, vicente, espinel, this, claim, was, also, repeated, by, nicolas, doizi, de, velasco, in, 1640, however, this, claim, has, been, refuted, by, others, who, state, that, espinel, s, birth, year, 1550, make, it, impossible, for, him, to, be, responsible, for, the, tradition, he, believed, that, the, tuning, was, the, reason, the, instrument, became, known, as, the, spanish, guitar, in, italy, even, later, in, the, same, century, gaspar, sanz, wrote, that, other, nations, such, as, italy, or, france, added, to, the, spanish, guitar, all, of, these, nations, even, imitated, the, five, course, guitar, by, recreating, their, own, finally, c, 1850, the, form, and, structure, of, the, modern, guitar, were, developed, by, different, spanish, makers, such, as, manuel, de, soto, y, solares, and, perhaps, the, most, important, of, all, guitar, makers, antonio, torres, jurado, who, increased, the, size, of, the, guitar, body, altered, its, proportions, and, invented, the, breakthrough, fan, braced, pattern, bracing, the, internal, pattern, of, wood, reinforcements, used, to, secure, the, guitar, s, top, and, back, and, prevent, the, instrument, from, collapsing, under, tension, is, an, important, factor, in, how, the, guitar, sounds, torres, design, greatly, improved, the, volume, tone, and, projection, of, the, instrument, and, it, has, remained, essentially, unchanged, since, guitars, are, often, divided, into, two, broad, categories, acoustic, and, electric, guitars, within, each, category, there, are, further, sub, categories, that, are, nearly, endless, in, quantity, and, are, always, evolving, for, example, an, electric, guitar, can, be, purchased, in, a, six, string, model, the, most, common, model, or, in, seven, or, twelve, string, formats, an, instruments, overall, design, internal, construction, and, components, wood, type, or, species, hardware, and, electronic, appointments, all, add, to, the, abundant, nature, of, sub, categories, and, its, unique, tonal, functional, property, acoustic, guitars, form, several, notable, subcategories, within, the, acoustic, guitar, group, classical, and, flamenco, guitars, steel, string, guitars, which, include, the, flat, topped, or, folk, guitar, twelve, string, guitars, and, the, arched, top, guitar, the, acoustic, guitar, group, also, includes, unamplified, guitars, designed, to, play, in, different, registers, such, as, the, acoustic, bass, guitar, which, has, a, similar, tuning, to, that, of, the, electric, bass, guitar, renaissance, and, baroque, guitars, are, the, ancestors, of, the, modern, classical, and, flamenco, guitar, they, are, substantially, smaller, more, delicate, in, construction, and, generate, less, volume, the, strings, are, paired, in, courses, as, in, a, modern, 12, string, guitar, but, they, only, have, four, or, five, courses, of, strings, rather, than, six, single, strings, normally, used, now, they, were, more, often, used, as, rhythm, instruments, in, ensembles, than, as, solo, instruments, and, can, often, be, seen, in, that, role, in, early, music, performances, gaspar, sanz, s, instrucci, n, de, m, sica, sobre, la, guitarra, espa, ola, of, 1674, contains, his, whole, output, for, the, solo, guitar, renaissance, and, baroque, guitars, are, easily, distinguished, because, the, renaissance, guitar, is, very, plain, and, the, baroque, guitar, is, very, ornate, with, ivory, or, wood, inlays, all, over, the, neck, and, body, and, a, paper, cutout, inverted, wedding, cake, inside, the, hole, classical, guitars, also, known, as, spanish, guitars, are, typically, strung, with, nylon, strings, plucked, with, the, fingers, played, in, a, seated, position, and, are, used, to, play, a, diversity, of, musical, styles, including, classical, music, the, classical, guitar, s, wide, flat, neck, allows, the, musician, to, play, scales, arpeggios, and, certain, chord, forms, more, easily, and, with, less, adjacent, string, interference, than, on, other, styles, of, guitar, flamenco, guitars, are, very, similar, in, construction, but, they, are, associated, with, a, more, percussive, tone, in, portugal, the, same, instrument, is, often, used, with, steel, strings, particularly, in, its, role, within, fado, music, the, guitar, is, called, viola, or, viol, o, in, brazil, where, it, is, often, used, with, an, extra, seventh, string, by, choro, musicians, to, provide, extra, bass, support, in, mexico, the, popular, mariachi, band, includes, a, range, of, guitars, from, the, small, requinto, to, the, guitarr, n, a, guitar, larger, than, a, cello, which, is, tuned, in, the, bass, register, in, colombia, the, traditional, quartet, includes, a, range, of, instruments, too, from, the, small, bandola, sometimes, known, as, the, deleuze, guattari, for, use, when, traveling, or, in, confined, rooms, or, spaces, to, the, slightly, larger, tiple, to, the, full, sized, classical, guitar, the, requinto, also, appears, in, other, latin, american, countries, as, a, complementary, member, of, the, guitar, family, with, its, smaller, size, and, scale, permitting, more, projection, for, the, playing, of, single, lined, melodies, modern, dimensions, of, the, classical, instrument, were, established, by, the, spaniard, antonio, de, torres, jurado, 1817, 1892, flat, top, guitars, with, steel, strings, are, similar, to, the, classical, guitar, however, the, flat, top, body, size, is, usually, significantly, larger, than, a, classical, guitar, and, has, a, narrower, reinforced, neck, and, stronger, structural, design, the, robust, x, bracing, typical, of, flat, top, guitars, was, developed, in, the, 1840s, by, german, american, luthiers, of, whom, christian, friedrich, c, f, martin, is, the, best, known, originally, used, on, gut, strung, instruments, the, strength, of, the, system, allowed, the, later, guitars, to, withstand, the, additional, tension, of, steel, strings, steel, strings, produce, a, brighter, tone, and, a, louder, sound, the, acoustic, guitar, is, used, in, many, kinds, of, music, including, folk, country, bluegrass, pop, jazz, and, blues, many, variations, are, possible, from, the, roughly, classical, sized, oo, and, parlour, to, the, large, dreadnought, the, most, commonly, available, type, and, jumbo, ovation, makes, a, modern, variation, with, a, rounded, back, side, assembly, molded, from, artificial, materials, archtop, guitars, are, steel, string, instruments, in, which, the, top, and, often, the, back, of, the, instrument, are, carved, from, a, solid, billet, into, a, curved, rather, than, flat, shape, this, violin, like, construction, is, usually, credited, to, the, american, orville, gibson, lloyd, loar, of, the, gibson, mandolin, guitar, mfg, co, introduced, the, violin, inspired, f, shaped, hole, design, now, usually, associated, with, archtop, guitars, after, designing, a, style, of, mandolin, of, the, same, type, the, typical, archtop, guitar, has, a, large, deep, hollow, body, whose, form, is, much, like, that, of, a, mandolin, or, a, violin, family, instrument, nowadays, most, archtops, are, equipped, with, magnetic, pickups, and, they, are, therefore, both, acoustic, and, electric, f, hole, archtop, guitars, were, immediately, adopted, upon, their, release, by, both, jazz, and, country, musicians, and, have, remained, particularly, popular, in, jazz, music, usually, with, flatwound, strings, all, three, principal, types, of, resonator, guitars, were, invented, by, the, slovak, american, john, dopyera, 1893, 1988, for, the, national, and, dobro, do, pyera, bro, thers, companies, similar, to, the, flat, top, guitar, in, appearance, but, with, a, body, that, may, be, made, of, brass, nickel, silver, or, steel, as, well, as, wood, the, sound, of, the, resonator, guitar, is, produced, by, one, or, more, aluminum, resonator, cones, mounted, in, the, middle, of, the, top, the, physical, principle, of, the, guitar, is, therefore, similar, to, the, loudspeaker, the, original, purpose, of, the, resonator, was, to, produce, a, very, loud, sound, this, purpose, has, been, largely, superseded, by, electrical, amplification, but, the, resonator, guitar, is, still, played, because, of, its, distinctive, tone, resonator, guitars, may, have, either, one, or, three, resonator, cones, the, method, of, transmitting, sound, resonance, to, the, cone, is, either, a, biscuit, bridge, made, of, a, small, piece, of, hardwood, at, the, vertex, of, the, cone, nationals, or, a, spider, bridge, made, of, metal, and, mounted, around, the, rim, of, the, inverted, cone, dobros, three, cone, resonators, always, use, a, specialized, metal, bridge, the, type, of, resonator, guitar, with, a, neck, with, a, square, cross, section, called, square, neck, or, hawaiian, is, usually, played, face, up, on, the, lap, of, the, seated, player, and, often, with, a, metal, or, glass, slide, the, round, neck, resonator, guitars, are, normally, played, in, the, same, fashion, as, other, guitars, although, slides, are, also, often, used, especially, in, blues, a, steel, guitar, is, any, guitar, played, while, moving, a, polished, steel, bar, or, similar, hard, object, against, plucked, strings, the, bar, itself, is, called, a, steel, and, is, the, source, of, the, name, steel, guitar, the, instrument, differs, from, a, conventional, guitar, in, that, it, does, not, use, frets, conceptually, it, is, somewhat, akin, to, playing, a, guitar, with, one, finger, the, bar, known, for, its, portamento, capabilities, gliding, smoothly, over, every, pitch, between, notes, the, instrument, can, produce, a, sinuous, crying, sound, and, deep, vibrato, emulating, the, human, singing, voice, typically, the, strings, are, plucked, not, strummed, by, the, fingers, of, the, dominant, hand, while, the, steel, tone, bar, is, pressed, lightly, against, the, strings, and, moved, by, the, opposite, hand, the, instrument, is, played, while, sitting, placed, horizontally, across, the, player, s, knees, or, otherwise, supported, the, horizontal, playing, style, is, called, hawaiian, style, the, twelve, string, guitar, usually, has, steel, strings, and, it, is, widely, used, in, folk, music, blues, and, rock, and, roll, rather, than, having, only, six, strings, the, 12, string, guitar, has, six, courses, made, up, of, two, strings, each, like, a, mandolin, or, lute, the, highest, two, courses, are, tuned, in, unison, while, the, others, are, tuned, in, octaves, the, 12, string, guitar, is, also, made, in, electric, forms, the, chime, like, sound, of, the, 12, string, electric, guitar, was, the, basis, of, jangle, pop, the, acoustic, bass, guitar, is, a, bass, instrument, with, a, hollow, wooden, body, similar, to, though, usually, somewhat, larger, than, that, of, a, six, string, acoustic, guitar, like, the, traditional, electric, bass, guitar, and, the, double, bass, the, acoustic, bass, guitar, commonly, has, four, strings, which, are, normally, tuned, e, a, d, g, an, octave, below, the, lowest, four, strings, of, the, six, string, guitar, which, is, the, same, tuning, pitch, as, an, electric, bass, guitar, it, can, more, rarely, be, found, with, five, or, six, strings, which, provides, a, wider, range, of, notes, to, be, played, with, less, movement, up, and, down, the, neck, electric, guitars, can, have, solid, semi, hollow, or, hollow, bodies, solid, bodies, produce, little, sound, without, amplification, in, contrast, to, a, standard, acoustic, guitar, electric, guitars, instead, rely, on, electromagnetic, pickups, and, sometimes, piezoelectric, pickups, that, convert, the, vibration, of, the, steel, strings, into, signals, which, are, fed, to, an, amplifier, through, a, patch, cable, or, radio, transmitter, the, sound, is, frequently, modified, by, other, electronic, devices, effects, units, or, the, natural, distortion, of, valves, vacuum, tubes, or, the, pre, amp, in, the, amplifier, there, are, two, main, types, of, magnetic, pickups, single, and, double, coil, or, humbucker, each, of, which, can, be, passive, or, active, the, electric, guitar, is, used, extensively, in, jazz, blues, r, b, and, rock, and, roll, the, first, successful, magnetic, pickup, for, a, guitar, was, invented, by, george, beauchamp, and, incorporated, into, the, 1931, ro, pat, in, later, rickenbacker, frying, pan, lap, steel, other, manufacturers, notably, gibson, soon, began, to, install, pickups, in, archtop, models, after, world, war, ii, the, completely, solid, body, electric, was, popularized, by, gibson, in, collaboration, with, les, paul, and, independently, by, leo, fender, of, fender, music, the, lower, fretboard, action, the, height, of, the, strings, from, the, fingerboard, lighter, thinner, strings, and, its, electrical, amplification, lend, the, electric, guitar, to, techniques, less, frequently, used, on, acoustic, guitars, these, include, tapping, extensive, use, of, legato, through, pull, offs, and, hammer, ons, also, known, as, slurs, pinch, harmonics, volume, swells, and, use, of, a, tremolo, arm, or, effects, pedals, some, electric, guitar, models, feature, piezoelectric, pickups, which, function, as, transducers, to, provide, a, sound, closer, to, that, of, an, acoustic, guitar, with, the, flip, of, a, switch, or, knob, rather, than, switching, guitars, those, that, combine, piezoelectric, pickups, and, magnetic, pickups, are, sometimes, known, as, hybrid, guitars, hybrids, of, acoustic, and, electric, guitars, are, also, common, there, are, also, more, exotic, varieties, such, as, guitars, with, two, three, or, rarely, four, necks, all, manner, of, alternate, string, arrangements, fretless, fingerboards, used, almost, exclusively, on, bass, guitars, meant, to, emulate, the, sound, of, a, stand, up, bass, 5, 1, surround, guitar, and, such, solid, body, seven, string, guitars, were, popularized, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, other, artists, go, a, step, further, by, using, an, eight, string, guitar, with, two, extra, low, strings, although, the, most, common, seven, string, has, a, low, b, string, roger, mcguinn, of, the, byrds, and, rickenbacker, uses, an, octave, g, string, paired, with, the, regular, g, string, as, on, a, 12, string, guitar, allowing, him, to, incorporate, chiming, 12, string, elements, in, standard, six, string, playing, in, 1982, uli, jon, roth, developed, the, sky, guitar, with, a, vastly, extended, number, of, frets, which, was, the, first, guitar, to, venture, into, the, upper, registers, of, the, violin, roth, s, seven, string, and, mighty, wing, guitar, features, a, wider, octave, range, the, bass, guitar, also, called, an, electric, bass, or, simply, a, bass, is, similar, in, appearance, and, construction, to, an, electric, guitar, but, with, a, longer, neck, and, scale, length, and, four, to, six, strings, the, four, string, bass, by, far, the, most, common, is, usually, tuned, the, same, as, the, double, bass, which, corresponds, to, pitches, one, octave, lower, than, the, four, lowest, pitched, strings, of, a, guitar, e, a, d, and, g, the, bass, guitar, is, a, transposing, instrument, as, it, is, notated, in, bass, clef, an, octave, higher, than, it, sounds, as, is, the, double, bass, to, avoid, excessive, ledger, lines, being, required, below, the, staff, like, the, electric, guitar, the, bass, guitar, has, pickups, and, it, is, plugged, into, an, amplifier, and, speaker, for, live, performances, modern, guitars, can, be, constructed, to, suit, both, left, and, right, handed, players, typically, the, dominant, hand, is, used, to, pluck, or, strum, the, strings, this, is, similar, to, the, violin, family, of, instruments, where, the, dominant, hand, controls, the, bow, left, handed, players, usually, play, a, mirror, image, instrument, manufactured, especially, for, left, handed, players, there, are, other, options, some, unorthodox, including, learn, to, play, a, right, handed, guitar, as, if, the, player, is, right, handed, or, playing, an, unmodified, right, handed, guitar, reversed, guitarist, jimi, hendrix, played, a, right, handed, guitar, strung, in, reverse, the, treble, strings, and, bass, strings, reversed, the, problem, with, doing, this, is, that, it, reverses, the, guitar, s, saddle, angle, the, saddle, is, the, strip, of, material, on, top, of, the, bridge, where, the, strings, rest, it, is, normally, slanted, slightly, making, the, bass, strings, longer, than, the, treble, strings, in, part, the, reason, for, this, is, the, difference, in, the, thickness, of, the, strings, physical, properties, of, the, thicker, bass, strings, require, them, to, be, slightly, longer, than, the, treble, strings, to, correct, intonation, reversing, the, strings, therefore, reverses, the, orientation, of, the, saddle, adversely, affecting, intonation, the, headstock, is, located, at, the, end, of, the, guitar, neck, farthest, from, the, body, it, is, fitted, with, machine, heads, that, adjust, the, tension, of, the, strings, which, in, turn, affects, the, pitch, the, traditional, tuner, layout, is, 3, 3, in, which, each, side, of, the, headstock, has, three, tuners, such, as, on, gibson, les, pauls, in, this, layout, the, headstocks, are, commonly, symmetrical, many, guitars, feature, other, layouts, including, six, in, line, tuners, featured, on, fender, stratocasters, or, even, 4, 2, e, g, ernie, ball, music, man, some, guitars, such, as, steinbergers, do, not, have, headstocks, at, all, in, which, case, the, tuning, machines, are, located, elsewhere, either, on, the, body, or, the, bridge, the, nut, is, a, small, strip, of, bone, plastic, brass, corian, graphite, stainless, steel, or, other, medium, hard, material, at, the, joint, where, the, headstock, meets, the, fretboard, its, grooves, guide, the, strings, onto, the, fretboard, giving, consistent, lateral, string, placement, it, is, one, of, the, endpoints, of, the, strings, vibrating, length, it, must, be, accurately, cut, or, it, can, contribute, to, tuning, problems, due, to, string, slippage, or, string, buzz, to, reduce, string, friction, in, the, nut, which, can, adversely, affect, tuning, stability, some, guitarists, fit, a, roller, nut, some, instruments, use, a, zero, fret, just, in, front, of, the, nut, in, this, case, the, nut, is, used, only, for, lateral, alignment, of, the, strings, the, string, height, and, length, being, dictated, by, the, zero, fret, a, guitar, s, frets, fretboard, tuners, headstock, and, truss, rod, all, attached, to, a, long, wooden, extension, collectively, constitute, its, neck, the, wood, used, to, make, the, fretboard, usually, differs, from, the, wood, in, the, rest, of, the, neck, the, bending, stress, on, the, neck, is, considerable, particularly, when, heavier, gauge, strings, are, used, see, tuning, and, the, ability, of, the, neck, to, resist, bending, see, truss, rod, is, important, to, the, guitar, s, ability, to, hold, a, constant, pitch, during, tuning, or, when, strings, are, fretted, the, rigidity, of, the, neck, with, respect, to, the, body, of, the, guitar, is, one, determinant, of, a, good, instrument, versus, a, poor, quality, one, the, cross, section, of, the, neck, can, also, vary, from, a, gentle, c, curve, to, a, more, pronounced, v, curve, there, are, many, different, types, of, neck, profiles, available, giving, the, guitarist, many, options, some, aspects, to, consider, in, a, guitar, neck, may, be, the, overall, width, of, the, fretboard, scale, distance, between, the, frets, the, neck, wood, the, type, of, neck, construction, for, example, the, neck, may, be, glued, in, or, bolted, on, and, the, shape, profile, of, the, back, of, the, neck, other, types, of, material, used, to, make, guitar, necks, are, graphite, steinberger, guitars, aluminum, kramer, guitars, travis, bean, and, veleno, guitars, or, carbon, fiber, modulus, guitars, and, threeguitars, double, neck, electric, guitars, have, two, necks, allowing, the, musician, to, quickly, switch, between, guitar, sounds, the, neck, joint, or, heel, is, the, point, at, which, the, neck, is, either, bolted, or, glued, to, the, body, of, the, guitar, almost, all, acoustic, steel, string, guitars, with, the, primary, exception, of, taylors, have, glued, otherwise, known, as, set, necks, while, electric, guitars, are, constructed, using, both, types, most, classical, guitars, have, a, neck, and, headblock, carved, from, one, piece, of, wood, known, as, a, spanish, heel, commonly, used, set, neck, joints, include, mortise, and, tenon, joints, such, as, those, used, by, c, f, martin, co, dovetail, joints, also, used, by, c, f, martin, on, the, d, 28, and, similar, models, and, spanish, heel, neck, joints, which, are, named, after, the, shoe, they, resemble, and, commonly, found, in, classical, guitars, all, three, types, offer, stability, bolt, on, necks, though, they, are, historically, associated, with, cheaper, instruments, do, offer, greater, flexibility, in, the, guitar, s, set, up, and, allow, easier, access, for, neck, joint, maintenance, and, repairs, another, type, of, neck, only, available, for, solid, body, electric, guitars, is, the, neck, through, body, construction, these, are, designed, so, that, everything, from, the, machine, heads, down, to, the, bridge, is, located, on, the, same, piece, of, wood, the, sides, also, known, as, wings, of, the, guitar, are, then, glued, to, this, central, piece, some, luthiers, prefer, this, method, of, construction, as, they, claim, it, allows, better, sustain, of, each, note, some, instruments, may, not, have, a, neck, joint, at, all, having, the, neck, and, sides, built, as, one, piece, and, the, body, built, around, it, the, fingerboard, also, called, the, fretboard, is, a, piece, of, wood, embedded, with, metal, frets, that, comprises, the, top, of, the, neck, it, is, flat, on, classical, guitars, and, slightly, curved, crosswise, on, acoustic, and, electric, guitars, the, curvature, of, the, fretboard, is, measured, by, the, fretboard, radius, which, is, the, radius, of, a, hypothetical, circle, of, which, the, fretboard, s, surface, constitutes, a, segment, the, smaller, the, fretboard, radius, the, more, noticeably, curved, the, fretboard, is, most, modern, guitars, feature, a, 12, neck, radius, while, older, guitars, from, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, usually, feature, a, 6, 8, neck, radius, pinching, a, string, against, a, fret, on, the, fretboard, effectively, shortens, the, vibrating, length, of, the, string, producing, a, higher, pitch, fretboards, are, most, commonly, made, of, rosewood, ebony, maple, and, sometimes, manufactured, using, composite, materials, such, as, hpl, or, resin, see, the, section, neck, below, for, the, importance, of, the, length, of, the, fretboard, in, connection, to, other, dimensions, of, the, guitar, the, fingerboard, plays, an, essential, role, in, the, treble, tone, for, acoustic, guitars, the, quality, of, vibration, of, the, fingerboard, is, the, principal, characteristic, for, generating, the, best, treble, tone, for, that, reason, ebony, wood, is, better, but, because, of, high, use, ebony, has, become, rare, and, extremely, expensive, most, guitar, manufacturers, have, adopted, rosewood, instead, of, ebony, almost, all, guitars, have, frets, which, are, metal, strips, usually, nickel, alloy, or, stainless, steel, embedded, along, the, fretboard, and, located, at, exact, points, that, divide, the, scale, length, in, accordance, with, a, specific, mathematical, formula, the, exceptions, include, fretless, bass, guitars, and, very, rare, fretless, guitars, pressing, a, string, against, a, fret, determines, the, strings, vibrating, length, and, therefore, its, resultant, pitch, the, pitch, of, each, consecutive, fret, is, defined, at, a, half, step, interval, on, the, chromatic, scale, standard, classical, guitars, have, 19, frets, and, electric, guitars, between, 21, and, 24, frets, although, guitars, have, been, made, with, as, many, as, 27, frets, frets, are, laid, out, to, accomplish, an, equal, tempered, division, of, the, octave, each, set, of, twelve, frets, represents, an, octave, the, twelfth, fret, divides, the, scale, length, exactly, into, two, halves, and, the, 24th, fret, position, divides, one, of, those, halves, in, half, again, the, ratio, of, the, spacing, of, two, consecutive, frets, is, 2, 12, displaystyle, sqrt, 2, twelfth, root, of, two, in, practice, luthiers, determine, fret, positions, using, the, constant, 17, 817, an, approximation, to, 1, 1, 1, 2, 12, displaystyle, sqrt, 2, if, the, nth, fret, is, a, distance, x, from, the, bridge, then, the, distance, from, the, n, 1, th, fret, to, the, bridge, is, x, x, 17, 817, frets, are, available, in, several, different, gauges, and, can, be, fitted, according, to, player, preference, among, these, are, jumbo, frets, which, have, a, much, thicker, gauge, allowing, for, use, of, a, slight, vibrato, technique, from, pushing, the, string, down, harder, and, softer, scalloped, fretboards, where, the, wood, of, the, fretboard, itself, is, scooped, out, between, the, frets, allow, a, dramatic, vibrato, effect, fine, frets, much, flatter, allow, a, very, low, string, action, but, require, that, other, conditions, such, as, curvature, of, the, neck, be, well, maintained, to, prevent, buzz, the, truss, rod, is, a, thin, strong, metal, rod, that, runs, along, the, inside, of, the, neck, it, is, used, to, correct, changes, to, the, neck, s, curvature, caused, by, aging, of, the, neck, timbers, changes, in, humidity, or, to, compensate, for, changes, in, the, tension, of, strings, the, tension, of, the, rod, and, neck, assembly, is, adjusted, by, a, hex, nut, or, an, allen, key, bolt, on, the, rod, usually, located, either, at, the, headstock, sometimes, under, a, cover, or, just, inside, the, body, of, the, guitar, underneath, the, fretboard, and, accessible, through, the, sound, hole, some, truss, rods, can, only, be, accessed, by, removing, the, neck, the, truss, rod, counteracts, the, immense, amount, of, tension, the, strings, place, on, the, neck, bringing, the, neck, back, to, a, straighter, position, turning, the, truss, rod, clockwise, tightens, it, counteracting, the, tension, of, the, strings, and, straightening, the, neck, or, creating, a, backward, bow, turning, the, truss, rod, counter, clockwise, loosens, it, allowing, string, tension, to, act, on, the, neck, and, creating, a, forward, bow, adjusting, the, truss, rod, affects, the, intonation, of, a, guitar, as, well, as, the, height, of, the, strings, from, the, fingerboard, called, the, action, some, truss, rod, systems, called, double, action, truss, systems, tighten, both, ways, pushing, the, neck, both, forward, and, backward, standard, truss, rods, can, only, release, to, a, point, beyond, which, the, neck, is, no, longer, compressed, and, pulled, backward, the, artist, and, luthier, irving, sloane, pointed, out, in, his, book, steel, string, guitar, construction, that, truss, rods, are, intended, primarily, to, remedy, concave, bowing, of, the, neck, but, cannot, correct, a, neck, with, back, bow, or, one, that, has, become, twisted, classical, guitars, do, not, require, truss, rods, as, their, nylon, strings, exert, a, lower, tensile, force, with, lesser, potential, to, cause, structural, problems, however, their, necks, are, often, reinforced, with, a, strip, of, harder, wood, such, as, an, ebony, strip, that, runs, down, the, back, of, a, cedar, neck, there, is, no, tension, adjustment, on, this, form, of, reinforcement, inlays, are, visual, elements, set, into, the, exterior, surface, of, a, guitar, both, for, decoration, and, artistic, purposes, and, in, the, case, of, the, markings, on, the, 3rd, 5th, 7th, and, 12th, fret, and, in, higher, octaves, to, provide, guidance, to, the, performer, about, the, location, of, frets, on, the, instrument, the, typical, locations, for, inlay, are, on, the, fretboard, headstock, and, on, acoustic, guitars, around, the, soundhole, known, as, the, rosette, inlays, range, from, simple, plastic, dots, on, the, fretboard, to, intricate, works, of, art, covering, the, entire, exterior, surface, of, a, guitar, front, and, back, some, guitar, players, have, used, leds, in, the, fretboard, to, produce, unique, lighting, effects, onstage, fretboard, inlays, are, most, commonly, shaped, like, dots, diamond, shapes, parallelograms, or, large, blocks, in, between, the, frets, dots, are, usually, inlaid, into, the, upper, edge, of, the, fretboard, in, the, same, positions, small, enough, to, be, visible, only, to, the, player, these, usually, appear, on, the, odd, numbered, frets, but, also, on, the, 12th, fret, the, one, octave, mark, instead, of, the, 11th, and, 13th, frets, some, older, or, high, end, instruments, have, inlays, made, of, mother, of, pearl, abalone, ivory, colored, wood, or, other, exotic, materials, and, designs, simpler, inlays, are, often, made, of, plastic, or, painted, high, end, classical, guitars, seldom, have, fretboard, inlays, as, a, well, trained, player, is, expected, to, know, his, or, her, way, around, the, instrument, in, addition, to, fretboard, inlay, the, headstock, and, soundhole, surround, are, also, frequently, inlaid, the, manufacturer, s, logo, or, a, small, design, is, often, inlaid, into, the, headstock, rosette, designs, vary, from, simple, concentric, circles, to, delicate, fretwork, mimicking, the, historic, rosette, of, lutes, bindings, that, edge, the, finger, and, soundboards, are, sometimes, inlaid, some, instruments, have, a, filler, strip, running, down, the, length, and, behind, the, neck, used, for, strength, or, to, fill, the, cavity, through, which, the, truss, rod, was, installed, in, the, neck, in, acoustic, guitars, string, vibration, is, transmitted, through, the, bridge, and, saddle, to, the, body, via, sound, board, the, sound, board, is, typically, made, of, tonewoods, such, as, spruce, or, cedar, timbers, for, tonewoods, are, chosen, for, both, strength, and, ability, to, transfer, mechanical, energy, from, the, strings, to, the, air, within, the, guitar, body, sound, is, further, shaped, by, the, characteristics, of, the, guitar, body, s, resonant, cavity, in, expensive, instruments, the, entire, body, is, made, of, wood, in, inexpensive, instruments, the, back, may, be, made, of, plastic, in, an, acoustic, instrument, the, body, of, the, guitar, is, a, major, determinant, of, the, overall, sound, quality, the, guitar, top, or, soundboard, is, a, finely, crafted, and, engineered, element, made, of, tonewoods, such, as, spruce, and, red, cedar, this, thin, piece, of, wood, often, only, 2, or, 3, mm, thick, is, strengthened, by, differing, types, of, internal, bracing, many, luthiers, consider, the, top, the, dominant, factor, in, determining, the, sound, quality, the, majority, of, the, instrument, s, sound, is, heard, through, the, vibration, of, the, guitar, top, as, the, energy, of, the, vibrating, strings, is, transferred, to, it, the, body, of, an, acoustic, guitar, has, a, sound, hole, through, which, sound, projects, the, sound, hole, is, usually, a, round, hole, in, the, top, of, the, guitar, under, the, strings, the, air, inside, the, body, vibrates, as, the, guitar, top, and, body, is, vibrated, by, the, strings, and, the, response, of, the, air, cavity, at, different, frequencies, is, characterized, like, the, rest, of, the, guitar, body, by, a, number, of, resonance, modes, at, which, it, responds, more, strongly, the, top, back, and, ribs, of, an, acoustic, guitar, body, are, very, thin, 1, 2, mm, so, a, flexible, piece, of, wood, called, lining, is, glued, into, the, corners, where, the, rib, meets, the, top, and, back, this, interior, reinforcement, provides, 5, to, 20, mm, of, solid, gluing, area, for, these, corner, joints, solid, linings, are, often, used, in, classical, guitars, while, kerfed, lining, is, most, often, found, in, steel, string, acoustics, kerfed, lining, is, also, called, kerfing, because, it, is, scored, or, kerfed, incompletely, sawn, through, to, allow, it, to, bend, with, the, shape, of, the, rib, during, final, construction, a, small, section, of, the, outside, corners, is, carved, or, routed, out, and, filled, with, binding, material, on, the, outside, corners, and, decorative, strips, of, material, next, to, the, binding, which, is, called, purfling, this, binding, serves, to, seal, off, the, end, grain, of, the, top, and, back, purfling, can, also, appear, on, the, back, of, an, acoustic, guitar, marking, the, edge, joints, of, the, two, or, three, sections, of, the, back, binding, and, purfling, materials, are, generally, made, of, either, wood, or, plastic, body, size, shape, and, style, have, changed, over, time, 19th, century, guitars, now, known, as, salon, guitars, were, smaller, than, modern, instruments, differing, patterns, of, internal, bracing, have, been, used, over, time, by, luthiers, torres, hauser, ramirez, fleta, and, c, f, martin, were, among, the, most, influential, designers, of, their, time, bracing, not, only, strengthens, the, top, against, potential, collapse, due, to, the, stress, exerted, by, the, tensioned, strings, but, also, affects, the, resonance, characteristics, of, the, top, the, back, and, sides, are, made, out, of, a, variety, of, timbers, such, as, mahogany, indian, rosewood, and, highly, regarded, brazilian, rosewood, dalbergia, nigra, each, one, is, primarily, chosen, for, their, aesthetic, effect, and, can, be, decorated, with, inlays, and, purfling, instruments, with, larger, areas, for, the, guitar, top, were, introduced, by, martin, in, an, attempt, to, create, greater, volume, levels, the, popularity, of, the, larger, dreadnought, body, size, amongst, acoustic, performers, is, related, to, the, greater, sound, volume, produced, most, electric, guitar, bodies, are, made, of, wood, and, include, a, plastic, pickguard, boards, wide, enough, to, use, as, a, solid, body, are, very, expensive, due, to, the, worldwide, depletion, of, hardwood, stock, since, the, 1970s, so, the, wood, is, rarely, one, solid, piece, most, bodies, are, made, from, two, pieces, of, wood, with, some, of, them, including, a, seam, running, down, the, center, line, of, the, body, the, most, common, woods, used, for, electric, guitar, body, construction, include, maple, basswood, ash, poplar, alder, and, mahogany, many, bodies, consist, of, good, sounding, but, inexpensive, woods, like, ash, with, a, top, or, thin, layer, of, another, more, attractive, wood, such, as, maple, with, a, natural, flame, pattern, glued, to, the, top, of, the, basic, wood, guitars, constructed, like, this, are, often, called, flame, tops, the, body, is, usually, carved, or, routed, to, accept, the, other, elements, such, as, the, bridge, pickup, neck, and, other, electronic, components, most, electrics, have, a, polyurethane, or, nitrocellulose, lacquer, finish, other, alternative, materials, to, wood, are, used, in, guitar, body, construction, some, of, these, include, carbon, composites, plastic, material, such, as, polycarbonate, and, aluminum, alloys, the, main, purpose, of, the, bridge, on, an, acoustic, guitar, is, to, transfer, the, vibration, from, the, strings, to, the, soundboard, which, vibrates, the, air, inside, of, the, guitar, thereby, amplifying, the, sound, produced, by, the, strings, on, all, electric, acoustic, and, original, guitars, the, bridge, holds, the, strings, in, place, on, the, body, there, are, many, varied, bridge, designs, there, may, be, some, mechanism, for, raising, or, lowering, the, bridge, saddles, to, adjust, the, distance, between, the, strings, and, the, fretboard, action, or, fine, tuning, the, intonation, of, the, instrument, some, are, spring, loaded, and, feature, a, whammy, bar, a, removable, arm, that, lets, the, player, modulate, the, pitch, by, changing, the, tension, on, the, strings, the, whammy, bar, is, sometimes, also, called, a, tremolo, bar, the, effect, of, rapidly, changing, pitch, is, properly, called, vibrato, see, tremolo, for, further, discussion, of, this, term, some, bridges, also, allow, for, alternate, tunings, at, the, touch, of, a, button, on, almost, all, modern, electric, guitars, the, bridge, has, saddles, that, are, adjustable, for, each, string, so, that, intonation, stays, correct, up, and, down, the, neck, if, the, open, string, is, in, tune, but, sharp, or, flat, when, frets, are, pressed, the, bridge, saddle, position, can, be, adjusted, with, a, screwdriver, or, hex, key, to, remedy, the, problem, in, general, flat, notes, are, corrected, by, moving, the, saddle, forward, and, sharp, notes, by, moving, it, backward, on, an, instrument, correctly, adjusted, for, intonation, the, actual, length, of, each, string, from, the, nut, to, the, bridge, saddle, is, slightly, but, measurably, longer, than, the, scale, length, of, the, instrument, this, additional, length, is, called, compensation, which, flattens, all, notes, a, bit, to, compensate, for, the, sharping, of, all, fretted, notes, caused, by, stretching, the, string, during, fretting, the, saddle, of, a, guitar, is, the, part, of, the, bridge, that, physically, supports, the, strings, it, may, be, one, piece, typically, on, acoustic, guitars, or, separate, pieces, one, for, each, string, electric, guitars, and, basses, the, saddle, s, basic, purpose, is, to, provide, the, endpoint, for, the, string, s, vibration, at, the, correct, location, for, proper, intonation, and, on, acoustic, guitars, to, transfer, the, vibrations, through, the, bridge, into, the, top, wood, of, the, guitar, saddles, are, typically, made, of, plastic, or, bone, for, acoustic, guitars, though, synthetics, and, some, exotic, animal, tooth, variations, e, g, fossilized, tooth, ivory, etc, have, become, popular, with, some, players, electric, guitar, saddles, are, typically, metal, though, some, synthetic, saddles, are, available, the, pickguard, also, known, as, the, scratch, plate, is, usually, a, piece, of, laminated, plastic, or, other, material, that, protects, the, finish, of, the, top, of, the, guitar, from, damage, due, to, the, use, of, a, plectrum, pick, or, fingernails, electric, guitars, sometimes, mount, pickups, and, electronics, on, the, pickguard, it, is, a, common, feature, on, steel, string, acoustic, guitars, some, performance, styles, that, use, the, guitar, as, a, percussion, instrument, tapping, the, top, or, sides, between, notes, etc, such, as, flamenco, require, that, a, scratchplate, or, pickguard, be, fitted, to, nylon, string, instruments, the, standard, guitar, has, six, strings, but, four, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, and, eighteen, string, guitars, are, also, available, classical, and, flamenco, guitars, historically, used, gut, strings, but, these, have, been, superseded, by, polymer, materials, such, as, nylon, and, fluorocarbon, modern, guitar, strings, are, constructed, from, metal, polymers, or, animal, or, plant, product, materials, steel, strings, may, be, made, from, alloys, incorporating, steel, nickel, or, phosphor, bronze, bass, strings, for, both, instruments, are, wound, rather, than, monofilament, pickups, are, transducers, attached, to, a, guitar, that, detect, or, pick, up, string, vibrations, and, convert, the, mechanical, energy, of, the, string, into, electrical, energy, the, resultant, electrical, signal, can, then, be, electronically, amplified, the, most, common, type, of, pickup, is, electromagnetic, in, design, these, contain, magnets, that, are, within, a, coil, or, coils, of, copper, wire, such, pickups, are, usually, placed, directly, underneath, the, guitar, strings, electromagnetic, pickups, work, on, the, same, principles, and, in, a, similar, manner, to, an, electric, generator, the, vibration, of, the, strings, creates, a, small, electric, current, in, the, coils, surrounding, the, magnets, this, signal, current, is, carried, to, a, guitar, amplifier, that, drives, a, loudspeaker, traditional, electromagnetic, pickups, are, either, single, coil, or, double, coil, single, coil, pickups, are, susceptible, to, noise, induced, by, stray, electromagnetic, fields, usually, mains, frequency, 60, or, 50, hertz, hum, the, introduction, of, the, double, coil, humbucker, in, the, mid, 1950s, solved, this, problem, through, the, use, of, two, coils, one, of, which, is, wired, in, opposite, polarity, to, cancel, or, buck, stray, fields, the, types, and, models, of, pickups, used, can, greatly, affect, the, tone, of, the, guitar, typically, humbuckers, which, are, two, magnet, coil, assemblies, attached, to, each, other, are, traditionally, associated, with, a, heavier, sound, single, coil, pickups, one, magnet, wrapped, in, copper, wire, are, used, by, guitarists, seeking, a, brighter, twangier, sound, with, greater, dynamic, range, modern, pickups, are, tailored, to, the, sound, desired, a, commonly, applied, approximation, used, in, the, selection, of, a, pickup, is, that, less, wire, lower, electrical, impedance, gives, a, brighter, sound, more, wire, gives, a, fat, tone, other, options, include, specialized, switching, that, produces, coil, splitting, in, out, of, phase, and, other, effects, guitar, circuits, are, either, active, needing, a, battery, to, power, their, circuit, or, as, in, most, cases, equipped, with, a, passive, circuit, fender, stratocaster, type, guitars, generally, have, three, single, coil, pickups, while, most, gibson, les, paul, types, have, humbucker, pickups, piezoelectric, or, piezo, pickups, represent, another, class, of, pickup, these, employ, piezoelectricity, to, generate, the, musical, signal, and, are, popular, in, hybrid, electro, acoustic, guitars, a, crystal, is, located, under, each, string, usually, in, the, saddle, when, the, string, vibrates, the, shape, of, the, crystal, is, distorted, and, the, stresses, associated, with, this, change, produce, tiny, voltages, across, the, crystal, that, can, be, amplified, and, manipulated, piezo, pickups, usually, require, a, powered, pre, amplifier, to, lift, their, output, to, match, that, of, electromagnetic, pickups, power, is, typically, delivered, by, an, on, board, battery, most, pickup, equipped, guitars, feature, onboard, controls, such, as, volume, or, tone, or, pickup, selection, at, their, simplest, these, consist, of, passive, components, such, as, potentiometers, and, capacitors, but, may, also, include, specialized, integrated, circuits, or, other, active, components, requiring, batteries, for, power, for, preamplification, and, signal, processing, or, even, for, electronic, tuning, in, many, cases, the, electronics, have, some, sort, of, shielding, to, prevent, pickup, of, external, interference, and, noise, guitars, may, be, shipped, or, retrofitted, with, a, hexaphonic, pickup, which, produces, a, separate, output, for, each, string, usually, from, a, discrete, piezoelectric, or, magnetic, pickup, this, arrangement, lets, on, board, or, external, electronics, process, the, strings, individually, for, modeling, or, musical, instrument, digital, interface, midi, conversion, roland, makes, gk, hexaphonic, pickups, for, guitar, and, bass, and, a, line, of, guitar, modeling, and, synthesis, products, line, 6, s, hexaphonic, equipped, variax, guitars, use, on, board, electronics, to, model, the, sound, after, various, vintage, instruments, and, vary, pitch, on, individual, strings, midi, converters, use, a, hexaphonic, guitar, signal, to, determine, pitch, duration, attack, and, decay, characteristics, the, midi, sends, the, note, information, to, an, internal, or, external, sound, bank, device, the, resulting, sound, closely, mimics, numerous, instruments, the, midi, setup, can, also, let, the, guitar, be, used, as, a, game, controller, i, e, rock, band, squier, or, as, an, instructional, tool, as, with, the, fretlight, guitar, by, the, 16th, century, the, guitar, tuning, of, adgbe, had, already, been, adopted, in, western, culture, a, lower, e, was, later, added, on, the, bottom, as, a, sixth, string, the, result, known, as, standard, tuning, has, the, strings, tuned, from, a, low, e, to, a, high, e, traversing, a, two, octave, range, eadgbe, this, tuning, is, a, series, of, ascending, fourths, and, a, single, major, third, from, low, to, high, the, reason, for, ascending, fourths, is, to, accommodate, four, fingers, on, four, frets, up, a, scale, before, moving, to, the, next, string, this, is, musically, convenient, and, physically, comfortable, and, it, eased, the, transition, between, fingering, chords, and, playing, scales, if, the, tuning, contained, all, perfect, fourths, the, range, would, be, two, octaves, plus, one, semitone, the, high, string, would, be, an, f, a, dissonant, half, step, from, the, low, e, and, much, out, of, place, the, pitches, are, as, follows, the, table, below, shows, a, pitch, s, name, found, over, the, six, strings, of, a, guitar, in, standard, tuning, from, the, nut, zero, to, the, twelfth, fret, for, four, strings, the, 5th, fret, on, one, string, is, the, same, open, note, as, the, next, string, for, example, a, 5th, fret, note, on, the, sixth, string, is, the, same, note, as, the, open, fifth, string, however, between, the, second, and, third, strings, an, irregularity, occurs, the, 4th, fret, note, on, the, third, string, is, equivalent, to, the, open, second, string, standard, tuning, has, evolved, to, provide, a, good, compromise, between, simple, fingering, for, many, chords, and, the, ability, to, play, common, scales, with, reasonable, left, hand, movement, there, are, also, a, variety, of, commonly, used, alternative, tunings, for, example, the, classes, of, open, regular, and, dropped, tunings, open, tuning, refers, to, a, guitar, tuned, so, that, strumming, the, open, strings, produces, a, chord, typically, a, major, chord, the, base, chord, consists, of, at, least, 3, notes, and, may, include, all, the, strings, or, a, subset, the, tuning, is, named, for, the, open, chord, open, d, open, g, and, open, a, are, popular, tunings, all, similar, chords, in, the, chromatic, scale, can, then, be, played, by, barring, a, single, fret, open, tunings, are, common, in, blues, music, and, folk, music, and, they, are, used, in, the, playing, of, slide, and, bottleneck, guitars, many, musicians, use, open, tunings, when, playing, slide, guitar, for, the, standard, tuning, there, is, exactly, one, interval, of, a, major, third, between, the, second, and, third, strings, and, all, the, other, intervals, are, fourths, the, irregularity, has, a, price, chords, cannot, be, shifted, around, the, fretboard, in, the, standard, tuning, e, a, d, g, b, e, which, requires, four, chord, shapes, for, the, major, chords, there, are, separate, chord, forms, for, chords, having, their, root, note, on, the, third, fourth, fifth, and, sixth, strings, in, contrast, regular, tunings, have, equal, intervals, between, the, strings, and, so, they, have, symmetrical, scales, all, along, the, fretboard, this, makes, it, simpler, to, translate, chords, for, the, regular, tunings, chords, may, be, moved, diagonally, around, the, fretboard, the, diagonal, movement, of, chords, is, especially, simple, for, the, regular, tunings, that, are, repetitive, in, which, case, chords, can, be, moved, vertically, chords, can, be, moved, three, strings, up, or, down, in, major, thirds, tuning, and, chords, can, be, moved, two, strings, up, or, down, in, augmented, fourths, tuning, regular, tunings, thus, appeal, to, new, guitarists, and, also, to, jazz, guitarists, whose, improvisation, is, simplified, by, regular, intervals, on, the, other, hand, some, chords, are, more, difficult, to, play, in, a, regular, tuning, than, in, standard, tuning, it, can, be, difficult, to, play, conventional, chords, especially, in, augmented, fourths, tuning, and, all, fifths, tuning, in, which, the, large, spacings, require, hand, stretching, some, chords, which, are, conventional, in, folk, music, are, difficult, to, play, even, in, all, fourths, and, major, thirds, tunings, which, do, not, require, more, hand, stretching, than, standard, tuning, another, class, of, alternative, tunings, is, called, drop, tunings, because, the, tuning, drops, down, the, lowest, string, dropping, down, the, lowest, string, a, whole, tone, results, in, the, drop, d, or, dropped, d, tuning, its, open, string, notes, dadgbe, from, low, to, high, allow, for, a, deep, bass, d, note, which, can, be, used, in, keys, such, as, d, major, d, minor, and, g, major, it, simplifies, the, playing, of, simple, fifths, powerchords, many, contemporary, rock, bands, re, tune, all, strings, down, making, for, example, drop, c, or, drop, b, tunings, many, scordatura, alternate, tunings, modify, the, standard, tuning, of, the, lute, especially, when, playing, renaissance, music, repertoire, originally, written, for, that, instrument, some, scordatura, drop, the, pitch, of, one, or, more, strings, giving, access, to, new, lower, notes, some, scordatura, makes, it, easier, to, play, in, unusual, keys, though, a, guitar, may, be, played, on, its, own, there, are, a, variety, of, common, accessories, used, for, holding, and, playing, the, guitar, a, capo, short, for, capotasto, is, used, to, change, the, pitch, of, open, strings, capos, are, clipped, onto, the, fretboard, with, the, aid, of, spring, tension, or, in, some, models, elastic, tension, to, raise, the, guitar, s, pitch, by, one, semitone, the, player, would, clip, the, capo, onto, the, fretboard, just, below, the, first, fret, its, use, allows, players, to, play, in, different, keys, without, having, to, change, the, chord, formations, they, use, for, example, if, a, folk, guitar, player, wanted, to, play, a, song, in, the, key, of, b, major, they, could, put, a, capo, on, the, second, fret, of, the, instrument, and, then, play, the, song, as, if, it, were, in, the, key, of, a, major, but, with, the, capo, the, instrument, would, make, the, sounds, of, b, major, this, is, because, with, the, capo, barring, the, entire, second, fret, open, chords, would, all, sound, two, semitones, in, other, words, one, tone, higher, in, pitch, for, example, if, a, guitarist, played, an, open, a, major, chord, a, very, common, open, chord, it, would, sound, like, a, b, major, chord, all, of, the, other, open, chords, would, be, similarly, modified, in, pitch, because, of, the, ease, with, which, they, allow, guitar, players, to, change, keys, they, are, sometimes, referred, to, with, pejorative, names, such, as, cheaters, or, the, hillbilly, crutch, despite, this, negative, viewpoint, another, benefit, of, the, capo, is, that, it, enables, guitarists, to, obtain, the, ringing, resonant, sound, of, the, common, keys, c, g, a, etc, in, harder, and, less, commonly, used, keys, classical, performers, are, known, to, use, them, to, enable, modern, instruments, to, match, the, pitch, of, historical, instruments, such, as, the, renaissance, music, lute, a, slide, or, a, steel, is, a, hard, smooth, object, a, steel, bar, round, metal, or, glass, bar, or, cylinder, neck, of, a, bottle, commonly, used, in, country, music, or, blues, music, to, create, a, glissando, effect, made, popular, in, hawaiian, music, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, the, slide, is, pressed, against, the, strings, by, the, non, dominant, hand, instead, of, using, player, s, fingers, on, frets, the, strings, are, then, plucked, by, the, dominant, hand, the, characteristic, use, of, the, slide, is, to, move, up, to, the, intended, pitch, by, as, the, name, implies, sliding, up, the, neck, to, the, desired, note, historically, necks, of, bottles, were, often, used, in, blues, and, country, music, as, improvised, slides, giving, the, name, bottleneck, guitar, to, a, style, of, blues, music, modern, slides, are, constructed, of, glass, plastic, ceramic, chrome, brass, or, steel, bars, or, cylinders, depending, on, the, weight, and, tone, desired, an, instrument, that, is, played, exclusively, in, this, manner, using, a, metal, bar, is, called, a, steel, guitar, or, pedal, steel, in, such, case, the, hard, object, is, called, a, steel, instead, of, a, slide, and, is, the, reason, for, the, name, steel, guitar, a, resonator, guitar, is, a, steel, guitar, built, with, a, metal, cone, under, the, strings, to, make, the, instrument, louder, a, guitar, pick, or, plectrum, is, a, small, piece, of, hard, material, generally, held, between, the, thumb, and, first, finger, of, the, picking, hand, and, is, used, to, pick, the, strings, though, most, classical, players, pick, with, a, combination, of, fingernails, and, fleshy, fingertips, the, pick, is, most, often, used, for, electric, and, steel, string, acoustic, guitars, though, today, they, are, mainly, plastic, variations, do, exist, such, as, bone, wood, steel, or, tortoise, shell, tortoise, shell, was, the, most, commonly, used, material, in, the, early, days, of, pick, making, but, as, tortoises, and, turtles, became, endangered, the, practice, of, using, their, shells, for, picks, or, anything, else, was, banned, tortoise, shell, picks, made, before, the, ban, are, often, coveted, for, a, supposedly, superior, tone, and, ease, of, use, and, their, scarcity, has, made, them, valuable, picks, come, in, many, shapes, and, sizes, picks, vary, from, the, small, jazz, pick, to, the, large, bass, pick, the, thickness, of, the, pick, often, determines, its, use, a, thinner, pick, between, 0, 2, and, 0, 5, mm, is, usually, used, for, strumming, or, rhythm, playing, whereas, thicker, picks, between, 0, 7, and, 1, 5, mm, are, usually, used, for, single, note, lines, or, lead, playing, the, distinctive, guitar, sound, of, billy, gibbons, is, attributed, to, using, a, quarter, or, peso, as, a, pick, similarly, brian, may, is, known, to, use, a, sixpence, coin, as, a, pick, while, noted, 1970s, and, early, 1980s, session, musician, david, persons, is, known, for, using, old, credit, cards, cut, to, the, correct, size, as, plectrums, thumb, picks, and, finger, picks, that, attach, to, the, fingertips, are, sometimes, employed, in, finger, picking, styles, on, steel, strings, these, allow, the, fingers, and, thumb, to, operate, independently, whereas, a, flat, pick, requires, the, thumb, and, one, or, two, fingers, to, manipulate, a, guitar, strap, is, a, strip, of, material, with, an, attachment, mechanism, on, each, end, made, to, hold, a, guitar, via, the, shoulders, at, an, adjustable, length, guitars, have, varying, accommodations, for, attaching, a, strap, the, most, common, are, strap, buttons, also, called, strap, pins, which, are, flanged, steel, posts, anchored, to, the, guitar, with, screws, two, strap, buttons, come, pre, attached, to, virtually, all, electric, guitars, and, many, steel, string, acoustic, guitars, strap, buttons, are, sometimes, replaced, with, strap, locks, which, connect, the, guitar, to, the, strap, more, securely, the, lower, strap, button, is, usually, located, at, the, bottom, bridge, end, of, the, body, the, upper, strap, button, is, usually, located, near, or, at, the, top, neck, end, of, the, body, on, the, upper, body, curve, at, the, tip, of, the, upper, horn, on, a, double, cutaway, or, at, the, neck, joint, heel, some, electrics, especially, those, with, odd, shaped, bodies, have, one, or, both, strap, buttons, on, the, back, of, the, body, some, steinberger, electric, guitars, owing, to, their, minimalist, and, lightweight, design, have, both, strap, buttons, at, the, bottom, of, the, body, rarely, on, some, acoustics, the, upper, strap, button, is, located, on, the, headstock, some, acoustic, and, classical, guitars, only, have, a, single, strap, button, at, the, bottom, of, the, body, the, other, end, must, be, tied, onto, the, headstock, above, the, nut, and, below, the, machine, heads, electric, guitars, and, bass, guitars, have, to, be, used, with, a, guitar, amplifier, and, loudspeaker, or, a, bass, amplifier, and, speaker, respectively, in, order, to, make, enough, sound, to, be, heard, by, the, performer, and, audience, electric, guitars, and, bass, guitars, almost, always, use, magnetic, pickups, which, generate, an, electric, signal, when, the, musician, plucks, strums, or, otherwise, plays, the, instrument, the, amplifier, and, speaker, strengthen, this, signal, using, a, power, amplifier, and, a, loudspeaker, acoustic, guitars, that, are, equipped, with, a, piezoelectric, pickup, or, microphone, can, also, be, plugged, into, an, instrument, amplifier, acoustic, guitar, amp, or, pa, system, to, make, them, louder, with, electric, guitar, and, bass, the, amplifier, and, speaker, are, not, just, used, to, make, the, instrument, louder, by, adjusting, the, equalizer, controls, the, preamplifier, and, any, onboard, effects, units, reverb, distortion, overdrive, etc, the, player, can, also, modify, the, tone, also, called, the, timbre, or, colour, and, sound, of, the, instrument, acoustic, guitar, players, can, also, use, the, amp, to, change, the, sound, of, their, instrument, but, in, general, acoustic, guitar, amps, are, used, to, make, the, natural, acoustic, sound, of, the, instrument, louder, without, significantly, changing, its, sound
