an, architectural, drawing, or, architect, s, drawing, is, a, technical, drawing, of, a, building, or, building, project, that, falls, within, the, definition, of, architecture, architectural, drawings, are, used, by, architects, and, others, for, a, number, of, purposes, to, develop, a, design, idea, into, a, coherent, proposal, to, communicate, ideas, and, concepts, to, convince, clients, of, the, merits, of, a, design, to, assist, a, building, contractor, to, construct, it, based, on, design, intent, as, a, record, of, the, design, and, planned, development, or, to, make, a, record, of, a, building, that, already, exists, architectural, drawings, are, made, according, to, a, set, of, conventions, which, include, particular, views, floor, plan, section, etc, sheet, sizes, units, of, measurement, and, scales, annotation, and, cross, referencing, historically, drawings, were, made, in, ink, on, paper, or, similar, material, and, any, copies, required, had, to, be, laboriously, made, by, hand, the, twentieth, century, saw, a, shift, to, drawing, on, tracing, paper, so, that, mechanical, copies, could, be, run, off, efficiently, the, development, of, the, computer, had, a, major, impact, on, the, methods, used, to, design, and, create, technical, drawings, making, manual, drawing, almost, obsolete, and, opening, up, new, possibilities, of, form, using, organic, shapes, and, complex, geometry, today, the, vast, majority, of, drawings, are, created, using, cad, software, the, oldest, architectural, elevation, drawing, was, found, in, a, piece, of, white, terracotta, crucibles, unearthed, in, china, dated, 7400, years, ago, it, shows, 2, stilted, watch, towers, or, light, houses, with, spiral, staircase, above, water, the, size, of, drawings, reflects, the, materials, available, and, the, size, that, is, convenient, to, transport, rolled, up, or, folded, laid, out, on, a, table, or, pinned, up, on, a, wall, the, drafting, process, may, impose, limitations, on, the, size, that, is, realistically, workable, sizes, are, determined, by, a, consistent, paper, size, system, according, to, local, usage, normally, the, largest, paper, size, used, in, modern, architectural, practice, is, iso, a0, 841, mm, 1, 189, mm, or, 33, 1, in, 46, 8, in, or, in, the, usa, arch, e, 762, mm, 1, 067, mm, or, 30, in, 42, in, or, large, e, size, 915, mm, 1, 220, mm, or, 36, in, 48, in, architectural, drawings, are, drawn, to, scale, so, that, relative, sizes, are, correctly, represented, the, scale, is, chosen, both, to, ensure, the, whole, building, will, fit, on, the, chosen, sheet, size, and, to, show, the, required, amount, of, detail, on, the, scale, of, one, eighth, of, an, inch, to, one, foot, 1, 96, or, the, metric, equivalent, of, 1, to, 100, walls, are, typically, shown, as, simple, outlines, corresponding, to, the, overall, thickness, at, a, larger, scale, half, an, inch, to, one, foot, 1, 24, or, the, nearest, common, metric, equivalent, 1, to, 20, the, layers, of, different, materials, that, make, up, the, wall, construction, are, shown, construction, details, are, drawn, to, a, larger, scale, in, some, cases, full, size, 1, to, 1, scale, scale, drawings, enable, dimensions, to, be, read, off, the, drawing, i, e, measured, directly, imperial, scales, feet, and, inches, are, equally, readable, using, an, ordinary, ruler, on, a, one, eighth, inch, to, one, foot, scale, drawing, the, one, eighth, divisions, on, the, ruler, can, be, read, off, as, feet, architects, normally, use, a, scale, ruler, with, different, scales, marked, on, each, edge, a, third, method, used, by, builders, in, estimating, is, to, measure, directly, off, the, drawing, and, multiply, by, the, scale, factor, dimensions, can, be, measured, off, drawings, made, on, a, stable, medium, such, as, vellum, all, processes, of, reproduction, introduce, small, errors, especially, now, that, different, copying, methods, mean, that, the, same, drawing, may, be, re, copied, or, copies, made, in, several, different, ways, consequently, dimensions, need, to, be, written, figured, on, the, drawing, the, disclaimer, do, not, scale, off, dimensions, is, commonly, inscribed, on, architects, drawings, to, guard, against, errors, arising, in, the, copying, process, this, section, deals, with, the, conventional, views, used, to, represent, a, building, or, structure, see, the, types, of, architectural, drawing, section, below, for, drawings, classified, according, to, their, purpose, a, floor, plan, is, the, most, fundamental, architectural, diagram, a, view, from, above, showing, the, arrangement, of, spaces, in, a, building, in, the, same, way, as, a, map, but, showing, the, arrangement, at, a, particular, level, of, a, building, technically, it, is, a, horizontal, section, cut, through, a, building, conventionally, at, four, feet, one, metre, and, twenty, centimetres, above, floor, level, showing, walls, windows, and, door, openings, and, other, features, at, that, level, the, plan, view, includes, anything, that, could, be, seen, below, that, level, the, floor, stairs, but, only, up, to, the, plan, level, fittings, and, sometimes, furniture, objects, above, the, plan, level, e, g, beams, overhead, can, be, indicated, as, dashed, lines, geometrically, plan, view, is, defined, as, a, vertical, orthographic, projection, of, an, object, onto, a, horizontal, plane, with, the, horizontal, plane, cutting, through, the, building, a, site, plan, is, a, specific, type, of, plan, showing, the, whole, context, of, a, building, or, group, of, buildings, a, site, plan, shows, property, boundaries, and, means, of, access, to, the, site, and, nearby, structures, if, they, are, relevant, to, the, design, for, a, development, on, an, urban, site, the, site, plan, may, need, to, show, adjoining, streets, to, demonstrate, how, the, design, fits, into, the, urban, fabric, within, the, site, boundary, the, site, plan, gives, an, overview, of, the, entire, scope, of, work, it, shows, the, buildings, if, any, already, existing, and, those, that, are, proposed, usually, as, a, building, footprint, roads, parking, lots, footpaths, hard, landscaping, trees, and, planting, for, a, construction, project, the, site, plan, also, needs, to, show, all, the, services, connections, drainage, and, sewer, lines, water, supply, electrical, and, communications, cables, exterior, lighting, etc, site, plans, are, commonly, used, to, represent, a, building, proposal, prior, to, detailed, design, drawing, up, a, site, plan, is, a, tool, for, deciding, both, the, site, layout, and, the, size, and, orientation, of, proposed, new, buildings, a, site, plan, is, used, to, verify, that, a, proposal, complies, with, local, development, codes, including, restrictions, on, historical, sites, in, this, context, the, site, plan, forms, part, of, a, legal, agreement, and, there, may, be, a, requirement, for, it, to, be, drawn, up, by, a, licensed, professional, architect, engineer, landscape, architect, or, land, surveyor, an, elevation, is, a, view, of, a, building, seen, from, one, side, a, flat, representation, of, one, fa, ade, this, is, the, most, common, view, used, to, describe, the, external, appearance, of, a, building, each, elevation, is, labelled, in, relation, to, the, compass, direction, it, faces, e, g, looking, toward, the, north, you, would, be, seeing, the, southern, elevation, of, the, building, buildings, are, rarely, a, simple, rectangular, shape, in, plan, so, a, typical, elevation, may, show, all, the, parts, of, the, building, that, are, seen, from, a, particular, direction, geometrically, an, elevation, is, a, horizontal, orthographic, projection, of, a, building, onto, a, vertical, plane, the, vertical, plane, normally, being, parallel, to, one, side, of, the, building, architects, also, use, the, word, elevation, as, a, synonym, for, fa, ade, so, the, north, elevation, is, the, north, facing, wall, of, the, building, a, cross, section, also, simply, called, a, section, represents, a, vertical, plane, cut, through, the, object, in, the, same, way, as, a, floor, plan, is, a, horizontal, section, viewed, from, the, top, in, the, section, view, everything, cut, by, the, section, plane, is, shown, as, a, bold, line, often, with, a, solid, fill, to, show, objects, that, are, cut, through, and, anything, seen, beyond, generally, shown, in, a, thinner, line, sections, are, used, to, describe, the, relationship, between, different, levels, of, a, building, in, the, observatorium, drawing, illustrated, here, the, section, shows, the, dome, which, can, be, seen, from, the, outside, a, second, dome, that, can, only, be, seen, inside, the, building, and, the, way, the, space, between, the, two, accommodates, a, large, astronomical, telescope, relationships, that, would, be, difficult, to, understand, from, plans, alone, a, sectional, elevation, is, a, combination, of, a, cross, section, with, elevations, of, other, parts, of, the, building, seen, beyond, the, section, plane, geometrically, a, cross, section, is, a, horizontal, orthographic, projection, of, a, building, on, to, a, vertical, plane, with, the, vertical, plane, cutting, through, the, building, isometric, and, axonometric, projections, are, a, simple, way, of, representing, a, three, dimensional, object, keeping, the, elements, to, scale, and, showing, the, relationship, between, several, sides, of, the, same, object, so, that, the, complexities, of, a, shape, can, be, clearly, understood, there, is, some, confusion, over, the, distinction, between, the, terms, isometric, and, axonometric, axonometric, is, a, word, that, has, been, used, by, architects, for, hundreds, of, years, engineers, use, the, word, axonometric, as, a, generic, term, to, include, isometric, diametric, and, trimetric, drawings, this, article, uses, the, terms, in, the, architecture, specific, sense, despite, fairly, complex, geometrical, explanations, for, the, purposes, of, practical, drafting, the, difference, between, isometric, and, axonometric, is, simple, see, diagram, above, in, both, the, plan, is, drawn, on, a, skewed, or, rotated, grid, and, the, verticals, are, projected, vertically, on, the, page, all, lines, are, drawn, to, scale, so, that, relationships, between, elements, are, accurate, in, many, cases, a, different, scale, is, required, for, different, axes, and, again, this, can, be, calculated, but, in, practice, was, often, simply, estimated, by, eye, traditional, drafting, techniques, used, 30, 60, and, 45, degree, set, squares, and, that, determined, the, angles, used, in, these, views, once, the, adjustable, square, became, common, those, limitations, were, lifted, the, axonometric, gained, in, popularity, in, the, twentieth, century, not, just, as, a, convenient, diagram, but, as, a, formal, presentation, technique, adopted, in, particular, by, the, modern, movement, axonometric, drawings, feature, prominently, in, the, influential, 1970, s, drawings, of, michael, graves, james, stirling, and, others, using, not, only, straightforward, views, but, worms, eye, view, unusually, and, exaggerated, rotations, of, the, plan, and, exploded, elements, detail, drawings, show, a, small, part, of, the, construction, at, a, larger, scale, to, show, how, the, component, parts, fit, together, they, are, also, used, to, show, small, surface, details, for, example, decorative, elements, section, drawings, at, large, scale, are, a, standard, way, of, showing, building, construction, details, typically, showing, complex, junctions, such, as, floor, to, wall, junction, window, openings, eaves, and, roof, apex, that, cannot, be, clearly, shown, on, a, drawing, that, includes, the, full, height, of, the, building, a, full, set, of, construction, details, needs, to, show, plan, details, as, well, as, vertical, section, details, one, detail, is, seldom, produced, in, isolation, a, set, of, details, shows, the, information, needed, to, understand, the, construction, in, three, dimensions, typical, scales, for, details, are, 1, 10, 1, 5, and, full, size, in, traditional, construction, many, details, were, so, fully, standardized, that, few, detail, drawings, were, required, to, construct, a, building, for, example, the, construction, of, a, sash, window, would, be, left, to, the, carpenter, who, would, fully, understand, what, was, required, but, unique, decorative, details, of, the, fa, ade, would, be, drawn, up, in, detail, in, contrast, modern, buildings, need, to, be, fully, detailed, because, of, the, proliferation, of, different, products, methods, and, possible, solutions, perspective, in, drawing, is, an, approximate, representation, on, a, flat, surface, of, an, image, as, it, is, perceived, by, the, eye, the, key, concepts, here, are, the, basic, categorization, of, artificial, perspective, is, by, the, number, of, vanishing, points, the, normal, convention, in, architectural, perspective, is, to, use, two, point, perspective, with, all, the, verticals, drawn, as, verticals, on, the, page, three, point, perspective, gives, a, casual, photographic, snapshot, effect, in, professional, architectural, photography, conversely, a, view, camera, or, a, perspective, control, lens, is, used, to, eliminate, the, third, vanishing, point, so, that, all, the, verticals, are, vertical, on, the, photograph, as, with, the, perspective, convention, this, can, also, be, done, by, digital, manipulation, of, a, photograph, taken, with, a, standard, lens, aerial, perspective, is, a, technique, in, painting, for, indicating, distance, by, approximating, the, effect, of, the, atmosphere, on, distant, objects, in, daylight, as, an, ordinary, object, gets, further, from, the, eye, its, contrast, with, the, background, is, reduced, its, color, saturation, is, reduced, and, its, color, becomes, more, blue, not, to, be, confused, with, aerial, view, or, bird, s, eye, view, which, is, the, view, as, seen, or, imagined, from, a, high, vantage, point, in, j, m, gandy, s, perspective, of, the, bank, of, england, see, illustration, at, the, beginning, of, this, article, gandy, portrayed, the, building, as, a, picturesque, ruin, in, order, to, show, the, internal, plan, arrangement, a, precursor, of, the, cutaway, view, a, montage, image, is, produced, by, superimposing, a, perspective, image, of, a, building, on, to, a, photographic, background, care, is, needed, to, record, the, position, from, which, the, photograph, was, taken, and, to, generate, the, perspective, using, the, same, viewpoint, this, technique, is, popular, in, computer, visualization, where, the, building, can, be, photorealistically, rendered, and, the, final, image, is, intended, to, be, almost, indistinguishable, from, a, photograph, a, sketch, is, a, rapidly, executed, freehand, drawing, a, quick, way, to, record, and, develop, an, idea, not, intended, as, a, finished, work, a, diagram, could, also, be, drawn, freehand, but, deals, with, symbols, to, develop, the, logic, of, a, design, both, can, be, worked, up, into, a, more, presentable, form, and, used, to, communicate, the, principles, of, a, design, in, architecture, the, finished, work, is, expensive, and, time, consuming, so, it, is, important, to, resolve, the, design, as, fully, as, possible, before, construction, work, begins, complex, modern, buildings, involve, a, large, team, of, different, specialist, disciplines, and, communication, at, the, early, design, stages, is, essential, to, keep, the, design, moving, towards, a, coordinated, outcome, architects, and, other, designers, start, investigating, a, new, design, with, sketches, and, diagrams, to, develop, a, rough, design, that, provides, an, adequate, response, to, the, particular, design, problems, there, are, two, basic, elements, to, a, building, design, the, aesthetic, and, the, practical, the, aesthetic, element, includes, the, layout, and, visual, appearance, the, anticipated, feel, of, the, materials, and, cultural, references, that, will, influence, the, way, people, perceive, the, building, practical, concerns, include, space, allocated, for, different, activities, how, people, enter, and, move, around, the, building, daylight, and, artificial, lighting, acoustics, traffic, noise, legal, matters, and, building, codes, and, many, other, issues, while, both, aspects, are, partly, a, matter, of, customary, practice, every, site, is, different, many, architects, actively, seek, innovation, thereby, increasing, the, number, of, problems, to, be, resolved, architectural, legend, often, refers, to, designs, made, on, the, back, of, an, envelope, or, on, a, napkin, initial, thoughts, are, important, even, if, they, have, to, be, discarded, along, the, way, because, they, provide, the, central, idea, around, which, the, design, can, develop, although, a, sketch, is, inaccurate, it, is, disposable, and, allows, for, freedom, of, thought, for, trying, different, ideas, quickly, choice, becomes, sharply, reduced, once, the, design, is, committed, to, a, scale, drawing, and, the, sketch, stage, is, almost, always, essential, diagrams, are, mainly, used, to, resolve, practical, matters, in, the, early, phases, of, the, design, architects, use, diagrams, to, develop, explore, and, communicate, ideas, and, solutions, they, are, essential, tools, for, thinking, problem, solving, and, communication, in, the, design, disciplines, diagrams, can, be, used, to, resolve, spatial, relationships, but, they, can, also, represent, forces, and, flows, e, g, the, forces, of, sun, and, wind, or, the, flows, of, people, and, materials, through, a, building, an, exploded, view, diagram, shows, component, parts, dis, assembled, in, some, way, so, that, each, can, be, seen, on, its, own, these, views, are, common, in, technical, manuals, but, are, also, used, in, architecture, either, in, conceptual, diagrams, or, to, illustrate, technical, details, in, a, cutaway, view, parts, of, the, exterior, are, omitted, to, show, the, interior, or, details, of, internal, construction, although, common, in, technical, illustration, including, many, building, products, and, systems, the, cutaway, is, in, fact, little, used, in, architectural, drawing, architectural, drawings, are, produced, for, a, specific, purpose, and, can, be, classified, accordingly, several, elements, are, often, included, on, the, same, sheet, for, example, a, sheet, showing, a, plan, together, with, the, principal, fa, ade, drawings, intended, to, explain, a, scheme, and, to, promote, its, merits, working, drawings, may, include, tones, or, hatches, to, emphasize, different, materials, but, they, are, diagrams, not, intended, to, appear, realistic, basic, presentation, drawings, typically, include, people, vehicles, and, trees, taken, from, a, library, of, such, images, and, are, otherwise, very, similar, in, style, to, working, drawings, rendering, is, the, art, of, adding, surface, textures, and, shadows, to, show, the, visual, qualities, of, a, building, more, realistically, an, architectural, illustrator, or, graphic, designer, may, be, employed, to, prepare, specialist, presentation, images, usually, perspectives, or, highly, finished, site, plans, floor, plans, and, elevations, etc, measured, drawings, of, existing, land, structures, and, buildings, architects, need, an, accurate, set, of, survey, drawings, as, a, basis, for, their, working, drawings, to, establish, exact, dimensions, for, the, construction, work, surveys, are, usually, measured, and, drawn, up, by, specialist, land, surveyors, historically, architects, have, made, record, drawings, in, order, to, understand, and, emulate, the, great, architecture, known, to, them, in, the, renaissance, architects, from, all, over, europe, studied, and, recorded, the, remains, of, the, roman, and, greek, civilizations, and, used, these, influences, to, develop, the, architecture, of, the, period, records, are, made, both, individually, for, local, purposes, and, on, a, large, scale, for, publication, historic, surveys, worth, referring, to, include, record, drawings, are, also, used, in, construction, projects, where, as, built, conditions, of, the, completed, building, are, documented, to, take, account, of, all, the, variations, made, during, the, course, of, construction, a, comprehensive, set, of, drawings, used, in, a, building, construction, project, these, will, include, not, only, architect, s, drawings, but, structural, and, other, engineering, drawings, as, well, working, drawings, logically, subdivide, into, location, assembly, and, component, drawings, formerly, working, drawings, would, typically, combine, plans, sections, elevations, and, some, details, to, provide, a, complete, explanation, of, a, building, on, one, sheet, that, was, possible, because, little, detail, was, included, the, building, techniques, involved, being, common, knowledge, amongst, building, professionals, modern, working, drawings, are, much, more, detailed, and, it, is, standard, practice, to, isolate, select, areas, of, the, project, on, separate, sheets, notes, included, on, drawings, are, brief, referring, to, standardized, specification, documents, for, more, information, understanding, the, layout, and, construction, of, a, modern, building, involves, studying, an, often, sizeable, set, of, drawings, and, documents, until, the, latter, part, of, the, 20th, century, all, architectural, drawings, were, manually, produced, if, not, by, the, architects, then, by, trained, but, less, skilled, draftsmen, or, drafters, who, did, not, generate, the, design, but, did, make, many, of, the, less, important, decisions, this, system, has, continued, with, cad, drafting, many, design, architects, have, little, or, no, knowledge, of, cad, software, programmes, relying, upon, others, to, take, their, designs, beyond, the, sketch, stage, draftsmen, often, specialize, in, a, type, of, structure, such, as, residential, or, commercial, or, in, a, type, of, construction, timber, frame, reinforced, concrete, prefabrication, etc, the, traditional, tools, of, the, architect, were, the, drawing, board, or, drafting, table, t, square, and, set, squares, protractor, compasses, pencil, and, drawing, pens, of, different, types, drawings, were, made, on, vellum, coated, linen, and, tracing, paper, lettering, would, either, be, done, by, hand, mechanically, using, a, stencil, or, a, combination, of, the, two, ink, lines, were, drawn, with, a, ruling, pen, a, relatively, sophisticated, device, similar, to, a, dip, in, pen, but, with, adjustable, line, width, capable, of, producing, a, very, fine, controlled, line, width, ink, pens, had, to, be, dipped, into, ink, frequently, draftsmen, worked, standing, up, keeping, the, ink, on, a, separate, table, to, avoid, spilling, ink, on, the, drawing, developments, in, the, 20th, century, included, the, parallel, motion, drawing, board, as, well, as, more, complex, improvements, on, the, basic, t, square, the, development, of, reliable, technical, drawing, pens, allowed, for, faster, drafting, and, stenciled, lettering, letraset, dry, transfer, lettering, and, half, tone, sheets, were, popular, from, the, 1970s, until, computers, made, those, processes, obsolete, computer, aided, design, generally, referred, to, by, the, acronym, cad, is, the, use, of, computer, software, to, create, drawings, today, the, vast, majority, of, technical, drawings, of, all, kinds, are, made, using, cad, instead, of, drawing, lines, on, paper, the, computer, records, equivalent, information, electronically, there, are, many, advantages, to, this, system, repetition, is, reduced, because, complex, elements, can, be, copied, duplicated, and, stored, for, re, use, errors, can, be, deleted, and, the, speed, of, drafting, allows, many, permutations, to, be, tried, before, the, design, is, finalized, on, the, other, hand, cad, drawing, encourages, a, proliferation, of, detail, and, increased, expectations, of, accuracy, aspects, which, reduce, the, efficiency, originally, expected, from, the, move, to, computerization, professional, cad, software, such, as, autocad, is, complex, and, requires, both, training, and, experience, before, the, operator, becomes, fully, productive, consequently, skilled, cad, operators, are, often, divorced, from, the, design, process, simpler, software, such, as, sketchup, and, vectorworks, allows, for, more, intuitive, drawing, and, is, intended, as, a, design, tool, cad, is, used, to, create, all, kinds, of, drawings, from, working, drawings, to, photorealistic, perspective, views, architectural, renderings, also, called, visualizations, are, made, by, creating, a, three, dimensional, model, using, cad, the, model, can, be, viewed, from, any, direction, to, find, the, most, useful, viewpoints, different, software, for, example, autodesk, 3ds, max, is, then, used, to, apply, color, and, texture, to, surfaces, and, to, represent, shadows, and, reflections, the, result, can, be, accurately, combined, with, photographic, elements, people, cars, background, landscape, building, information, modeling, bim, is, the, logical, development, of, cad, drawing, a, relatively, new, technology, but, fast, becoming, mainstream, the, design, team, collaborates, to, create, a, three, dimensional, computer, model, and, all, plans, and, other, two, dimensional, views, are, generated, directly, from, the, model, ensuring, spatial, consistency, the, key, innovation, here, is, to, share, the, model, via, the, internet, so, that, all, the, design, functions, site, survey, architecture, structure, and, services, can, be, integrated, into, a, single, model, or, as, a, series, of, models, associated, with, each, specialism, that, are, shared, throughout, the, design, development, process, some, form, of, management, not, necessarily, by, the, architect, needs, to, be, in, place, to, resolve, conflicting, priorities, the, starting, point, of, bim, is, spatial, design, but, it, also, enables, components, to, be, quantified, and, scheduled, directly, from, the, information, embedded, in, the, model, building, information, modelling, can, be, characterized, into, 3, different, levels, ranging, from, 0, 3, these, levels, represent, bim, maturity, and, distinguishes, the, amount, of, cooperation, in, projects, they, gauge, information, being, shared, throughout, the, whole, process, level, 0, is, individualized, with, no, collaboration, individuals, are, working, on, their, own, cad, files, separately, and, working, using, their, own, standards, these, are, known, to, be, more, traditional, ways, which, are, being, phased, out, therefore, no, longer, being, used, today, level, 1, is, a, mixture, of, 3d, and, 2d, work, project, teams, are, required, to, manage, and, share, data, amongst, the, team, aspects, such, as, naming, conventions, should, be, adopted, level, 2, involves, all, team, members, using, 3d, models, although, they, might, not, being, using, the, same, information, the, built, environment, is, shared, through, a, similar, file, formats, this, level, also, introduces, construction, sequencing, and, cost, level, 3, involves, working, on, a, shared, project, model, the, model, exists, in, a, central, environment, and, can, be, modified, by, everyone, conflicting, information, is, reduced, due, to, real, time, update, on, models, later, levels, include, sequencing, components, cost, estimation, and, accounting, for, upfront, costs, parametric, design, is, an, example, of, computer, intelligence, rising, in, the, field, of, architecture, it, is, the, creation, of, complex, relationships, between, models, measurements, in, parametric, design, connect, by, scripts, users, can, adjust, and, adapt, their, models, based, on, measurements, changing, one, measurement, will, affect, other, measurements, based, on, the, set, parameters, the, parametric, design, uses, scalability, and, adjustments, which, involve, complex, organic, shapes, it, allows, for, the, creation, of, forms, that, would, not, be, possible, with, regular, 3d, modeling, or, would, take, copious, amounts, of, time, models, can, decrease, production, time, therefore, allowing, for, the, time, allotted, to, other, times, of, the, design, process, an, argument, with, parametric, design, is, the, question, of, practicality, at, times, it, is, unsure, whether, or, not, these, styles, properly, comply, with, users, wants, and, needs, real, life, examples, of, parametric, designs, would, be, the, metropol, parasol, in, seville, or, the, canton, in, guangzhou, china, these, forms, have, a, commonality, with, complex, repetitive, patterns, which, twist, bend, and, curve, in, dramatic, ways, these, lattices, are, unique, and, there, is, a, complexity, tied, with, how, they, look, this, is, coined, as, parametricism, by, zaha, hadid, which, is, a, style, based, on, digital, animation, techniques, an, architectural, animation, is, a, short, film, showing, how, a, proposed, building, will, look, the, moving, image, makes, three, dimensional, forms, much, easier, to, understand, an, animation, is, generated, from, a, series, of, hundreds, or, even, thousands, of, still, images, each, made, in, the, same, way, as, an, architectural, visualization, a, computer, generated, building, is, created, using, a, cad, programs, and, that, is, used, to, create, more, or, less, realistic, views, from, a, sequence, of, viewpoints, the, simplest, animations, use, a, moving, viewpoint, while, more, complex, animations, can, include, moving, objects, people, vehicles, and, so, on, schools, are, producing, well, versed, architecture, students, who, perform, in, computer, assisted, collaboration, construction, automation, and, intelligent, buildings, which, promise, to, have, as, much, impact, before, the, adaptation, of, technologies, it, s, important, to, understand, that, architects, are, problem, solvers, and, critical, thinking, which, has, been, used, since, the, dawn, of, man, is, still, being, carried, on, the, idea, of, innovation, responsiveness, and, critical, thinking, will, never, be, phased, out, and, always, relevant, today, although, pure, drafting, which, involves, manually, drawing, plans, for, construction, is, not, being, used, as, often, because, of, cad, they, are, training, architects, to, exercise, human, centered, designers, and, to, dive, deeper, into, culture, to, ultimately, understand, clientele, human, centered, design, involves, the, human, perspective, in, all, steps, of, the, design, process, the, unpredictability, and, complexity, of, humans, is, unmatched, with, any, pre, programmed, systems, virtual, reality, in, architectural, projects, helps, designers, understand, spaces, from, a, cognitive, perspective, vr, stands, for, virtual, reality, and, explains, an, experience, in, a, world, that, doesn, t, exist, virtual, reality, creates, an, experience, generated, by, a, computer, program, the, use, of, motion, tracking, allows, for, quick, manipulation, it, creates, an, individual, secluded, experience, architecture, firms, are, using, this, as, a, tool, to, allow, employees, to, learn, and, create, a, more, engaging, experience, for, both, clients, and, employees, benefits, of, vr, for, architecture, include, low, start, up, costs, gaining, a, competitive, edge, avoiding, revision, and, the, duplication, of, real, world, scenarios, by, placing, a, client, into, a, virtual, world, the, feedback, is, often, more, straightforward, as, the, client, can, walk, through, the, environment, acvording, to, their, needs, and, aesthetic, choices, due, to, covid, 19, architecture, firms, have, increasingly, shifted, to, a, digital, environment, for, collaboration, video, conferencing, is, proving, to, be, a, popular, way, of, meeting, with, clients, and, simulating, the, studio, environment, collaboration, and, communication, using, programs, like, zoom, are, common, consistently, being, used, since, the, beginning, of, the, epidemic, people, are, expected, to, be, increasingly, well, versed, with, technology, although, coordination, is, often, difficult, programs, like, bim, help, improve, workflow, between, both, architects, clients, however, relationships, with, clients, are, harder, to, facilitate, because, clients, are, not, able, to, touch, or, feel, the, work, adaptation, is, critical, as, more, and, more, programs, are, being, implemented, among, the, studio, to, support, staff, reprographics, or, reprography, covers, a, variety, of, technologies, media, and, support, services, used, to, make, multiple, copies, of, original, drawings, prints, of, architectural, drawings, are, still, sometimes, called, blueprints, after, one, of, the, early, processes, which, produced, a, white, line, on, blue, paper, the, process, was, superseded, by, the, dye, line, print, system, which, prints, black, on, white, coated, paper, whiteprint, the, standard, modern, processes, are, the, ink, jet, printer, laser, printer, and, photocopier, of, which, the, ink, jet, and, laser, printers, are, commonly, used, for, large, format, printing, although, colour, printing, is, now, commonplace, it, remains, expensive, above, a3, size, and, architect, s, working, drawings, still, tend, to, adhere, to, the, black, and, white, greyscale, aesthetic
