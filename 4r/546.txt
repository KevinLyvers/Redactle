primarily, as, a, sketching, tool, in, preparation, for, the, finished, work, in, oil, or, engraving, until, the, end, of, the, eighteenth, century, traditional, watercolors, were, known, as, tinted, drawings, watercolor, art, dates, back, to, the, cave, paintings, of, paleolithic, europe, and, has, been, used, for, manuscript, illustration, since, at, least, egyptian, times, with, particular, prominence, in, the, european, middle, ages, however, its, continuous, history, as, an, art, medium, begins, with, the, renaissance, the, german, northern, renaissance, artist, albrecht, d, rer, 1471, 1528, who, painted, several, fine, botanical, wildlife, and, landscape, watercolors, is, generally, considered, among, the, earliest, examples, of, watercolor, an, important, school, of, watercolor, painting, in, germany, was, led, by, hans, bol, 1534, 1593, as, part, of, the, d, rer, renaissance, despite, this, early, start, watercolors, were, generally, used, by, baroque, easel, painters, only,

benedetto, castiglione, and, many, dutch, and, flemish, artists, however, botanical, illustration, and, wildlife, illustration, perhaps, form, the, oldest, and, most, important, traditions, in, watercolor, painting, botanical, illustrations, became, popular, during, the, renaissance, both, as, hand, tinted, woodblock, illustrations, in, books, or, broadsheets, and, as, tinted, ink, drawings, on, vellum, or, paper, botanical, artists, have, traditionally, been, some, of, the, most, exacting, and, accomplished, watercolor, painters, and, even, today, watercolors, with, their, unique, ability, to, summarize, clarify, and, idealize, in, full, color, are, used, to, illustrate, scientific, and, museum, publications, wildlife, illustration, reached, its, peak, in, the, 19th, century, with, artists, such, as, john, james, audubon, and, today, many, naturalist, field, guides, are, still, illustrated, with, watercolor, paintings, several, factors, contributed, to, the, spread, of, watercolor, painting, during, the, 18th, century, particularly, in, england, among, the, elite, and, aristocratic, classes, watercolor, painting, was, one, of, the, incidental, adornments, of, a, good, education, mapmakers, military, officers, and, engineers, valued, it, for, its, usefulness, in, depicting, properties, terrain, fortifications, field, geology, and, for, illustrating, public, works, or, commissioned, projects, watercolor, artists, were, commonly, taken, on, geological, or, archaeological, expeditions, funded, by, the, society, of, dilettanti, founded, in, 1733, to, document, discoveries, in, the, mediterranean, asia, and, the, new, world, these, expeditions, stimulated, the, demand, for, topographical, painters, who, churned, out, memento, paintings, of, famous, sites, and, sights, along, the, grand, tour, to, italy, that, was, undertaken, by, every, fashionable, young, man, of, the, time, in, the, late, 18th, century, the, english, cleric, william, gilpin, wrote, a, series, of, hugely, popular, books, describing, his, picturesque, journeys, throughout, rural, england, and, illustrated, them, with, self, made, sentimentalized, monochrome, watercolors, of, river, valleys, ancient, castles, and, abandoned, churches, this, example, popularized, watercolors, as, a, form, of, personal, tourist, journal, the, confluence, of, these, cultural, engineering, scientific, tourist, and, amateur, interests, culminated, in, the, celebration, and, promotion, of, watercolor, as, a, distinctly, english, national, art, william, blake, published, several, books, of, hand, tinted, engraved, poetry, provided, illustrations, to, dante, s, inferno, and, he, also, experimented, with, large, monotype, works, in, watercolor, among, the, many, other, significant, watercolorists, of, this, period, were, thomas, gainsborough, john, robert, cozens, francis, towne, michael, angelo, rooker, william, pars, thomas, hearne, and, john, warwick, smith, from, the, late, 18th, century, through, the, 19th, century, the, market, for, printed, books, and, domestic, art, contributed, substantially, to, the, growth, of, the, medium, watercolors, were, used, as, the, basic, document, from, which, collectible, landscape, or, tourist, engravings, were, developed, and, hand, painted, watercolor, originals, or, copies, of, famous, paintings, contributed, to, many, upper, class, art, portfolios, satirical, broadsides, by, thomas, rowlandson, many, published, by, rudolph, ackermann, were, also, extremely, popular, the, three, english, artists, credited, with, establishing, watercolor, as, an, independent, mature, painting, medium, are, paul, sandby, 1730, 1809, often, called, the, father, of, the, english, watercolor, thomas, girtin, 1775, 1802, who, pioneered, its, use, for, large, format, romantic, or, picturesque, landscape, painting, and, joseph, mallord, william, turner, 1775, 1851, who, brought, watercolor, painting, to, the, highest, pitch, of, power, and, refinement, and, created, hundreds, of, superb, historical, topographical, architectural, and, mythological, watercolor, paintings, his, method, of, developing, the, watercolor, painting, in, stages, starting, with, large, vague, color, areas, established, on, wet, paper, then, refining, the, image, through, a, sequence, of, washes, and, glazes, permitted, him, to, produce, large, numbers, of, paintings, with, workshop, efficiency, and, made, him, a, multimillionaire, partly, by, sales, from, his, personal, art, gallery, the, first, of, its, kind, among, the, important, and, highly, talented, contemporaries, of, turner, and, girtin, were, john, varley, john, sell, cotman, anthony, copley, fielding, samuel, palmer, william, havell, and, samuel, prout, the, swiss, painter, abraham, louis, rodolphe, ducros, was, also, widely, known, for, his, large, format, romantic, paintings, in, watercolor, the, confluence, of, amateur, activity, publishing, markets, middle, class, art, collecting, and, 19th, century, technique, led, to, the, formation, of, english, watercolor, painting, societies, the, society, of, painters, in, water, colours, 1804, now, known, as, the, royal, watercolour, society, and, the, new, water, colour, society, 1832, now, known, as, the, royal, institute, of, painters, in, water, colours, a, scottish, society, of, painters, in, water, colour, was, founded, in, 1878, now, known, as, the, royal, scottish, society, of, painters, in, watercolour, these, societies, provided, annual, exhibitions, and, buyer, referrals, for, many, artists, they, also, engaged, in, petty, status, rivalries, and, aesthetic, debates, particularly, between, advocates, of, traditional, transparent, watercolor, and, the, early, adopters, of, the, denser, color, possible, with, body, color, or, gouache, opaque, watercolor, the, late, georgian, and, victorian, periods, produced, the, zenith, of, the, british, watercolor, among, the, most, impressive, 19th, century, works, on, paper, due, to, artists, turner, varley, cotman, david, cox, peter, de, wint, william, henry, hunt, john, frederick, lewis, myles, birket, foster, frederick, walker, thomas, collier, arthur, melville, and, many, others, in, particular, the, graceful, lapidary, and, atmospheric, watercolors, genre, paintings, by, richard, parkes, bonington, created, an, international, fad, for, watercolor, painting, especially, in, england, and, france, in, the, 1820s, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 19th, century, portrait, painter, frederick, havill, became, a, key, player, in, the, establishment, of, watercolour, in, england, art, critic, huntly, carter, described, havill, as, a, founder, of, the, water, colour, school, the, popularity, of, watercolors, stimulated, many, innovations, including, heavier, and, more, sized, wove, papers, and, brushes, called, pencils, manufactured, expressly, for, watercolor, watercolor, tutorials, were, first, published, in, this, period, by, varley, cox, and, others, establishing, the, step, by, step, painting, instructions, that, still, characterize, the, genre, today, the, elements, of, drawing, a, watercolor, tutorial, by, english, art, critic, john, ruskin, has, been, out, of, print, only, once, since, it, was, first, published, in, 1857, commercial, brands, of, watercolor, were, marketed, and, paints, were, packaged, in, metal, tubes, or, as, dry, cakes, that, could, be, rubbed, out, dissolved, in, studio, porcelain, or, used, in, portable, metal, paint, boxes, in, the, field, breakthroughs, in, chemistry, made, many, new, pigments, available, including, synthetic, ultramarine, blue, cobalt, blue, viridian, cobalt, violet, cadmium, yellow, aureolin, potassium, cobaltinitrite, zinc, white, and, a, wide, range, of, carmine, and, madder, lakes, these, pigments, in, turn, stimulated, a, greater, use, of, color, with, all, painting, media, but, in, english, watercolors, particularly, by, the, pre, raphaelite, brotherhood, watercolor, painting, also, became, popular, in, the, united, states, during, the, 19th, century, outstanding, early, practitioners, included, john, james, audubon, as, well, as, early, hudson, river, school, painters, such, as, william, h, bartlett, and, george, harvey, by, mid, century, the, influence, of, john, ruskin, led, to, increasing, interest, in, watercolors, particularly, the, use, of, a, detailed, ruskinian, style, by, such, artists, as, john, w, hill, henry, william, trost, richards, roderick, newman, and, fidelia, bridges, the, american, society, of, painters, in, watercolor, now, the, american, watercolor, society, was, founded, in, 1866, late, 19th, century, american, exponents, of, the, medium, included, thomas, moran, thomas, eakins, john, lafarge, john, singer, sargent, childe, hassam, and, preeminently, winslow, homer, watercolor, was, less, popular, in, continental, europe, in, the, 18th, century, gouache, was, an, important, medium, for, the, italian, artists, marco, ricci, and, francesco, zuccarelli, whose, landscape, paintings, were, widely, collected, gouache, was, used, by, a, number, of, artists, in, france, as, well, in, the, 19th, century, the, influence, of, the, english, school, helped, popularize, transparent, watercolor, in, france, and, it, became, an, important, medium, for, eug, ne, delacroix, fran, ois, marius, granet, henri, joseph, harpignies, and, the, satirist, honor, daumier, other, european, painters, who, worked, frequently, in, watercolor, were, adolph, menzel, in, germany, and, stanis, aw, mas, owski, in, poland, the, adoption, of, brightly, colored, petroleum, derived, aniline, dyes, and, pigments, compounded, from, them, which, all, fade, rapidly, on, exposure, to, light, and, the, efforts, to, properly, conserve, the, twenty, thousand, j, m, w, turner, paintings, inherited, by, the, british, museum, in, 1857, led, to, a, negative, reevaluation, of, the, permanence, of, pigments, in, watercolor, this, caused, a, sharp, decline, in, their, status, and, market, value, nevertheless, isolated, practitioners, continued, to, prefer, and, develop, the, medium, into, the, 20th, century, paul, signac, created, landscape, and, maritime, watercolors, and, paul, c, zanne, developed, a, watercolor, painting, style, consisting, entirely, of, overlapping, small, glazes, of, pure, color, among, the, many, 20th, century, artists, who, produced, important, works, in, watercolor, were, wassily, kandinsky, emil, nolde, paul, klee, egon, schiele, and, raoul, dufy, in, america, the, major, exponents, included, charles, burchfield, edward, hopper, georgia, o, keeffe, charles, demuth, and, john, marin, 80, of, his, total, work, is, watercolor, in, this, period, american, watercolor, painting, often, emulated, european, impressionism, and, post, impressionism, but, significant, individualism, flourished, in, regional, styles, of, watercolor, painting, from, the, 1920s, to, 1940s, in, particular, the, cleveland, school, or, ohio, school, of, painters, centered, around, the, cleveland, museum, of, art, and, the, california, scene, painters, were, often, associated, with, hollywood, animation, studios, or, the, chouinard, art, institute, now, california, institute, of, the, arts, the, california, painters, exploited, their, state, s, varied, geography, mediterranean, climate, and, automobility, to, reinvigorate, the, outdoor, or, plein, air, tradition, the, most, influential, among, them, were, phil, dike, millard, sheets, rex, brandt, dong, kingman, and, milford, zornes, the, california, water, color, society, founded, in, 1921, and, later, renamed, the, national, watercolor, society, sponsored,

american, artist, barbara, prey, on, commission, for, mass, moca, the, work, can, be, seen, at, mass, moca, s, robert, w, wilson, building, although, the, rise, of, abstract, expressionism, and, the, trivializing, influence, of, amateur, painters, and, advertising, or, workshop, influenced, painting, styles, led, to, a, temporary, decline, in, the, popularity, of, watercolor, painting, after, c, 1950, watercolors, continue, to, be, utilized, by, artists, like, martha, burchfield, joseph, raffael, andrew, wyeth, philip, pearlstein, eric, fischl, gerhard, richter, anselm, kiefer, and,

there, are, stand, out, artists, such, as, francisco, bonn, n, guer, n, jos, comas, quesada, and, alberto, manrique, watercolor, paint, consists, of, four, principal, ingredients, a, pigment, gum, arabic, as, a, binder, to, hold, the, pigment, in, suspension, additives, like, glycerin, ox, gall, honey, and, preservatives, to, alter, the, viscosity, hiding, durability, or, color, of, the, pigment, and, vehicle, mixture, and, evaporating, water, as, a, solvent, used, to, thin, or, dilute, the, paint, for, application, the, more, general, term, watermedia, refers, to, any, painting, medium, that, uses, water, as, a, solvent, and, that, can, be, applied, with, a, brush, pen, or, sprayer, this, includes, most, inks, watercolors, temperas, caseins, gouaches, and, modern, acrylic, paints, the, term, watercolor, refers, to, paints, that, use, water, soluble, complex, carbohydrates, as, a, binder, originally, in, the, 16th, to, 18th, centuries, watercolor, binders, were, sugars, and, or, hide, glues, but, since, the, 19th, century, the, preferred, binder, is, natural, gum, arabic, with, glycerin, and, or, honey, as, additives, to, improve, plasticity, and, solubility, of, the, binder, and, with, other, chemicals, added, to, improve, product, shelf, life, the, term, bodycolor, refers, to, paint, that, is, opaque, rather, than, transparent, it, usually, refers, to, opaque, watercolor, known, as, gouache, modern, acrylic, paints, use, an, acrylic, resin, dispersion, as, a, binder, watercolor, painters, before, the, turn, of, the, 18th, century, had, to, make, paints, themselves, using, pigments, purchased, from, an, apothecary, or, specialized, colorman, and, mixing, them, with, gum, arabic, or, some, other, binder, the, earliest, commercial, paints, were, small, resinous, blocks, that, had, to, be, wetted, and, laboriously, rubbed, out, in, water, to, obtain, a, usable, color, intensity, william, reeves, started, his, business, as, a, colorman, around, 1766, in, 1781, he, and, his, brother, thomas, reeves, were, awarded, the, silver, palette, of, the, society, of, arts, for, the, invention, of, the, moist, watercolor, paint, cake, a, time, saving, convenience, introduced, in, the, golden, age, of, english, watercolor, painting, the, cake, was, immediately, soluble, when, touched, by, a, wet, brush, modern, commercial, watercolor, paints, are, available, in, tubes, pans, and, liquids, the, majority, of, paints, sold, today, are, in, collapsible, small, metal, tubes, in, standard, sizes, and, formulated, to, a, consistency, similar, to, toothpaste, by, being, already, mixed, with, a, certain, water, component, for, use, this, paste, has, to, be, further, diluted, with, water, pan, paints, actually, small, dried, cakes, or, bars, of, paint, in, an, open, plastic, container, are, usually, sold, in, two, sizes, full, pans, and, half, pans, owing, to, modern, industrial, organic, chemistry, the, variety, saturation, and, permanence, of, artists, colors, available, today, has, been, vastly, improved, correct, and, non, toxic, primary, colors, are, now, present, through, the, introduction, of, hansa, yellow, phthalo, blue, and, quinacridone, pv, 122, from, such, a, set, of, three, colors, in, principle, all, others, can, be, mixed, as, in, a, classical, technique, no, white, is, used, the, modern, development, of, pigments, was, not, driven, by, artistic, demand, the, art, materials, industry, is, too, small, to, exert, any, market, leverage, on, global, dye, or, pigment, manufacture, with, rare, exceptions, such, as, aureolin, all, modern, watercolor, paints, utilize, pigments, that, have, a, wider, industrial, use, paint, manufacturers, buy, by, industrial, standards, very, small, supplies, of, these, pigments, mill, them, with, the, vehicle, solvent, and, additives, and, package, them, the, milling, process, with, inorganic, pigments, in, more, expensive, brands, reduces, the, particle, size, to, improve, the, color, flow, when, the, paint, is, applied, with, water, in, the, partisan, debates, of, the, 19th, century, english, art, world, gouache, was, emphatically, contrasted, to, traditional, watercolors, and, denigrated, for, its, high, hiding, power, or, lack, of, transparency, transparent, watercolors, were, exalted, the, aversion, to, opaque, paint, had, its, origin, in, the, fact, that, well, into, the, 19th, century, lead, white, was, used, to, increase, the, covering, quality, that, pigment, tended, to, soon, discolor, into, black, under, the, influence, of, sulphurous, air, pollution, totally, ruining, the, artwork, the, traditional, claim, that, transparent, watercolors, gain, luminosity, because, they, function, like, a, pane, of, stained, glass, laid, on, paper, the, color, intensified, because, the, light, passes, through, the, pigment, reflects, from, the, paper, and, passes, a, second, time, through, the, pigment, on, its, way, to, the, viewer, is, false, watercolor, paints, typically, do, not, form, a, cohesive, paint, layer, as, do, acrylic, or, oil, paints, but, simply, scatter, pigment, particles, randomly, across, the, paper, surface, the, transparency, is, caused, by, the, paper, being, visible, between, the, particles, watercolors, may, appear, more, vivid, than, acrylics, or, oils, because, the, pigments, are, laid, down, in, a, purer, form, with, few, or, no, fillers, such, as, kaolin, obscuring, the, pigment, colors, typically, most, or, all, of, the, gum, binder, will, be, absorbed, by, the, paper, preventing, the, binder, from, changing, the, visibility, of, the, pigment, the, gum, being, absorbed, does, not, decrease, but, increase, the, adhesion, of, the, pigment, to, the, paper, as, its, particles, will, then, penetrate, the, fibres, more, easily, in, fact, an, important, function, of, the, gum, is, to, facilitate, the, lifting, removal, of, color, should, the, artist, want, to, create, a, lighter, spot, in, a, painted, area, furthermore, the, gum, prevents, flocculation, of, the, pigment, particles
