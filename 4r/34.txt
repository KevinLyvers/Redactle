whose, company, designed, and, built, the, tower, from, 1887, to, 1889, locally, nicknamed, la, dame, de, fer, french, for, iron, lady, it, was, constructed, as, the, centerpiece, of, the, 1889, world, s, fair, and, to, crown, the, centennial, anniversary, of, the, french, revolution, although, initially, criticised, by, some, of, france, s, leading, artists, and, intellectuals, for, its, design, it, has, since, become, a, global, cultural, icon, of, france, and, one, of, the, most, recognisable, structures, in, the, world, the, tower, received, 5, 889, 000, visitors, in, 2022, the, eiffel, tower, is, the, most, visited, monument, with, an, entrance, fee, in, the, world, 6, 91, million, people, ascended, it, in, 2015, it, was, designated, a, monument, historique, in, 1964, and, was, named, part, of, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, paris, banks, of, the, seine, in, 1991, the, tower, is, 330, metres, 1, 083, ft, tall, about, the, same, height, as, an, 81, storey, building, and, the, tallest, structure, in, paris, its, base, is, square, measuring, 125, metres, 410, ft, on, each, side, during, its, construction, the, eiffel, tower, surpassed, the, washington, monument, to, become, the, tallest, human, made, structure, in, the, world, a, title, it, held, for, 41, years, until, the, chrysler, building, in, new, york, city, was, finished, in, 1930, it, was, the, first, structure, in, the, world, to, surpass, both, the, 200, metre, and, 300, metre, mark, in, height, due, to, the, addition, of, a, broadcasting, aerial, at, the, top, of, the, tower, in, 1957, it, is, now, taller, than, the, chrysler, building, by, 5, 2, metres, 17, ft, excluding, transmitters, the, eiffel, tower, is, the, second, tallest, free, standing, structure, in, france, after, the, millau, viaduct, the, tower, has, three, levels, for, visitors, with, restaurants, on, the, first, and, second, levels, the, top, level, s, upper, platform, is, 276, m, 906, ft, above, the, ground, the, highest, observation, deck, accessible, to, the, public, in, the, european, union, tickets, can, be, purchased, to, ascend, by, stairs, or, lift, to, the, first, and, second, levels, the, climb, from, ground, level, to, the, first, level, is, over, 300, steps, as, is, the, climb, from, the, first, level, to, the, second, making, the, entire, ascent, a, 600, step, climb, although, there, is, a, staircase, to, the, top, level, it, is, usually, accessible, only, by, lift, on, this, top, third, level, is, a, private, apartment, built, for, gustave, eiffel, s, private, use, he, decorated, it, with, furniture, by, jean, lachaise, and, invited, friends, such, as, thomas, edison, the, design, of, the, eiffel, tower, is, attributed, to, maurice, koechlin, and, mile, nouguier, two, senior, engineers, working, for, the, compagnie, des, tablissements, eiffel, it, was, envisioned, after, discussion, about, a, suitable, centerpiece, for, the, proposed, 1889, exposition, universelle, a, world, s, fair, to, celebrate, the, centennial, of, the, french, revolution, in, may, 1884, working, at, home, koechlin, made, a, sketch, of, their, idea, described, by, him, as, a, great, pylon, consisting, of, four, lattice, girders, standing, apart, at, the, base, and, coming, together, at, the, top, joined, together, by, metal, trusses, at, regular, intervals, eiffel, initially, showed, little, enthusiasm, but, he, did, approve, further, study, and, the, two, engineers, then, asked, stephen, sauvestre, the, head, of, the, company, s, architectural, department, to, contribute, to, the, design, sauvestre, added, decorative, arches, to, the, base, of, the, tower, a, glass, pavilion, to, the, first, level, and, other, embellishments, the, new, version, gained, eiffel, s, support, he, bought, the, rights, to, the, patent, on, the, design, which, koechlin, nouguier, and, sauvestre, had, taken, out, and, the, design, was, put, on, display, at, the, exhibition, of, decorative, arts, in, the, autumn, of, 1884, under, the, company, name, on, 30, march, 1885, eiffel, presented, his, plans, to, the, soci, t, des, ing, nieurs, civils, after, discussing, the, technical, problems, and, emphasising, the, practical, uses, of, the, tower, he, finished, his, talk, by, saying, the, tower, would, symbolise, ot, only, the, art, of, the, modern, engineer, but, also, the, century, of, industry, and, science, in, which, we, are, living, and, for, which, the, way, was, prepared, by, the, great, scientific, movement, of, the, eighteenth, century, and, by, the, revolution, of, 1789, to, which, this, monument, will, be, built, as, an, expression, of, france, s, gratitude, little, progress, was, made, until, 1886, when, jules, gr, vy, was, re, elected, as, president, of, france, and, douard, lockroy, was, appointed, as, minister, for, trade, a, budget, for, the, exposition, was, passed, and, on, 1, may, lockroy, announced, an, alteration, to, the, terms, of, the, open, competition, being, held, for, a, centrepiece, to, the, exposition, which, effectively, made, the, selection, of, eiffel, s, design, a, foregone, conclusion, as, entries, had, to, include, a, study, for, a, 300, m, 980, ft, four, sided, metal, tower, on, the, champ, de, mars, a, 300, metre, tower, was, then, considered, a, herculean, engineering, effort, on, 12, may, a, commission, was, set, up, to, examine, eiffel, s, scheme, and, its, rivals, which, a, month, later, decided, that, all, the, proposals, except, eiffel, s, were, either, impractical, or, lacking, in, details, after, some, debate, about, the, exact, location, of, the, tower, a, contract, was, signed, on, 8, january, 1887, eiffel, signed, it, acting, in, his, own, capacity, rather, than, as, the, representative, of, his, company, the, contract, granting, him, 1, 5, million, francs, toward, the, construction, costs, less, than, a, quarter, of, the, estimated, 6, 5, million, francs, eiffel, was, to, receive, all, income, from, the, commercial, exploitation, of, the, tower, during, the, exhibition, and, for, the, next, 20, years, he, later, established, a, separate, company, to, manage, the, tower, putting, up, half, the, necessary, capital, himself, a, french, bank, the, cr, dit, industriel, et, commercial, cic, helped, finance, the, construction, of, the, eiffel, tower, during, the, period, of, the, tower, s, construction, the, cic, was, acquiring, funds, from, predatory, loans, to, the, national, bank, of, haiti, some, of, which, went, towards, the, financing, of, the, tower, these, loans, were, connected, to, an, indemnity, controversy, which, saw, france, force, haiti, s, government, to, financially, compensate, french, slaveowners, for, lost, income, as, a, result, of, the, haitian, revolution, and, required, haiti, to, pay, the, cic, and, its, partner, nearly, half, of, all, taxes, collected, on, exports, effectively, choking, off, the, nation, s, primary, source, of, income, according, to, the, new, york, times, a, time, when, the, was, helping, finance, one, of, the, world, s, best, known, landmarks, the, eiffel, tower, as, a, monument, to, french, liberty, it, was, choking, haiti, s, economy, taking, much, of, the, young, nation, s, income, back, to, paris, and, impairing, its, ability, to, start, schools, hospitals, and, the, other, building, blocks, of, an, independent, country, the, proposed, tower, had, been, a, subject, of, controversy, drawing, criticism, from, those, who, did, not, believe, it, was, feasible, and, those, who, objected, on, artistic, grounds, prior, to, the, eiffel, tower, s, construction, no, structure, had, ever, been, constructed, to, a, height, of, 300, m, or, even, 200, m, for, that, matter, and, many, people, believed, it, was, impossible, these, objections, were, an, expression, of, a, long, standing, debate, in, france, about, the, relationship, between, architecture, and, engineering, it, came, to, a, head, as, work, began, at, the, champ, de, mars, a, committee, of, three, hundred, one, member, for, each, metre, of, the, tower, s, height, was, formed, led, by, the, prominent, architect, charles, garnier, and, including, some, of, the, most, important, figures, of, the, arts, such, as, william, adolphe, bouguereau, guy, de, maupassant, charles, gounod, and, jules, massenet, a, petition, called, artists, against, the, eiffel, tower, was, sent, to, the, minister, of, works, and, commissioner, for, the, exposition, adolphe, alphand, and, it, was, published, by, le, temps, on, 14, february, 1887, we, writers, painters, sculptors, architects, and, passionate, devotees, of, the, hitherto, untouched, beauty, of, paris, protest, with, all, our, strength, with, all, our, indignation, in, the, name, of, slighted, french, taste, against, the, erection, of, this, useless, and, monstrous, eiffel, tower, to, bring, our, arguments, home, imagine, for, a, moment, a, giddy, ridiculous, tower, dominating, paris, like, a, gigantic, black, smokestack, crushing, under, its, barbaric, bulk, notre, dame, the, tour, saint, jacques, the, louvre, the, dome, of, les, invalides, the, arc, de, triomphe, all, of, our, humiliated, monuments, will, disappear, in, this, ghastly, dream, and, for, twenty, years, we, shall, see, stretching, like, a, blot, of, ink, the, hateful, shadow, of, the, hateful, column, of, bolted, sheet, metal, gustave, eiffel, responded, to, these, criticisms, by, comparing, his, tower, to, the, egyptian, pyramids, my, tower, will, be, the, tallest, edifice, ever, erected, by, man, will, it, not, also, be, grandiose, in, its, way, and, why, would, something, admirable, in, egypt, become, hideous, and, ridiculous, in, paris, these, criticisms, were, also, dealt, with, by, douard, lockroy, in, a, letter, of, support, written, to, alphand, sardonically, saying, judging, by, the, stately, swell, of, the, rhythms, the, beauty, of, the, metaphors, the, elegance, of, its, delicate, and, precise, style, one, can, tell, this, protest, is, the, result, of, collaboration, of, the, most, famous, writers, and, poets, of, our, time, and, he, explained, that, the, protest, was, irrelevant, since, the, project, had, been, decided, upon, months, before, and, construction, on, the, tower, was, already, under, way, indeed, garnier, was, a, member, of, the, tower, commission, that, had, examined, the, various, proposals, and, had, raised, no, objection, eiffel, was, similarly, unworried, pointing, out, to, a, journalist, that, it, was, premature, to, judge, the, effect, of, the, tower, solely, on, the, basis, of, the, drawings, that, the, champ, de, mars, was, distant, enough, from, the, monuments, mentioned, in, the, protest, for, there, to, be, little, risk, of, the, tower, overwhelming, them, and, putting, the, aesthetic, argument, for, the, tower, do, not, the, laws, of, natural, forces, always, conform, to, the, secret, laws, of, harmony, some, of, the, protesters, changed, their, minds, when, the, tower, was, built, others, remained, unconvinced, guy, de, maupassant, supposedly, ate, lunch, in, the, tower, s, restaurant, every, day, because, it, was, the, one, place, in, paris, where, the, tower, was, not, visible, by, 1918, it, had, become, a, symbol, of, paris, and, of, france, after, guillaume, apollinaire, wrote, a, nationalist, poem, in, the, shape, of, the, tower, a, calligram, to, express, his, feelings, about, the, war, against, germany, today, it, is, widely, considered, to, be, a, remarkable, piece, of, structural, art, and, is, often, featured, in, films, and, literature, work, on, the, foundations, started, on, 28, january, 1887, those, for, the, east, and, south, legs, were, straightforward, with, each, leg, resting, on, four, 2, m, 6, 6, ft, concrete, slabs, one, for, each, of, the, principal, girders, of, each, leg, the, west, and, north, legs, being, closer, to, the, river, seine, were, more, complicated, each, slab, needed, two, piles, installed, by, using, compressed, air, caissons, 15, m, 49, ft, long, and, 6, m, 20, ft, in, diameter, driven, to, a, depth, of, 22, m, 72, ft, to, support, the, concrete, slabs, which, were, 6, m, 20, ft, thick, each, of, these, slabs, supported, a, block, of, limestone, with, an, inclined, top, to, bear, a, supporting, shoe, for, the, ironwork, each, shoe, was, anchored, to, the, stonework, by, a, pair, of, bolts, 10, cm, 4, in, in, diameter, and, 7, 5, m, 25, ft, long, the, foundations, were, completed, on, 30, june, and, the, erection, of, the, ironwork, began, the, visible, work, on, site, was, complemented, by, the, enormous, amount, of, exacting, preparatory, work, that, took, place, behind, the, scenes, the, drawing, office, produced, 1, 700, general, drawings, and, 3, 629, detailed, drawings, of, the, 18, 038, different, parts, needed, the, task, of, drawing, the, components, was, complicated, by, the, complex, angles, involved, in, the, design, and, the, degree, of, precision, required, the, position, of, rivet, holes, was, specified, to, within, 1, mm, 0, 04, in, and, angles, worked, out, to, one, second, of, arc, the, finished, components, some, already, riveted, together, into, sub, assemblies, arrived, on, horse, drawn, carts, from, a, factory, in, the, nearby, parisian, suburb, of, levallois, perret, and, were, first, bolted, together, with, the, bolts, being, replaced, with, rivets, as, construction, progressed, no, drilling, or, shaping, was, done, on, site, if, any, part, did, not, fit, it, was, sent, back, to, the, factory, for, alteration, in, all, 18, 038, pieces, were, joined, using, 2, 5, million, rivets, at, first, the, legs, were, constructed, as, cantilevers, but, about, halfway, to, the, first, level, construction, was, paused, to, create, a, substantial, timber, scaffold, this, renewed, concerns, about, the, structural, integrity, of, the, tower, and, sensational, headlines, such, as, eiffel, suicide, and, gustave, eiffel, has, gone, mad, he, has, been, confined, in, an, asylum, appeared, in, the, tabloid, press, multiple, famous, artists, of, that, time, charles, garnier, and, alexander, dumas, thought, poorly, of, the, newly, made, tower, charles, garnier, thought, it, was, a, truly, tragic, street, lamp, alexander, dumas, said, that, it, was, like, odius, shadow, of, the, odious, column, built, of, rivets, and, iron, plates, extending, like, a, black, blot, there, were, multiple, protests, over, the, style, and, the, reasoning, of, placing, it, in, the, middle, of, paris, at, this, stage, a, small, creeper, crane, designed, to, move, up, the, tower, was, installed, in, each, leg, they, made, use, of, the, guides, for, the, lifts, which, were, to, be, fitted, in, the, four, legs, the, critical, stage, of, joining, the, legs, at, the, first, level, was, completed, by, the, end, of, march, 1888, although, the, metalwork, had, been, prepared, with, the, utmost, attention, to, detail, provision, had, been, made, to, carry, out, small, adjustments, to, precisely, align, the, legs, hydraulic, jacks, were, fitted, to, the, shoes, at, the, base, of, each, leg, capable, of, exerting, a, force, of, 800, tonnes, and, the, legs, were, intentionally, constructed, at, a, slightly, steeper, angle, than, necessary, being, supported, by, sandboxes, on, the, scaffold, although, construction, involved, 300, on, site, employees, due, to, eiffel, s, safety, precautions, and, the, use, of, movable, gangways, guardrails, and, screens, only, one, person, died, the, main, structural, work, was, completed, at, the, end, of, march, 1889, and, on, 31, march, eiffel, celebrated, by, leading, a, group, of, government, officials, accompanied, by, representatives, of, the, press, to, the, top, of, the, tower, because, the, lifts, were, not, yet, in, operation, the, ascent, was, made, by, foot, and, took, over, an, hour, with, eiffel, stopping, frequently, to, explain, various, features, most, of, the, party, chose, to, stop, at, the, lower, levels, but, a, few, including, the, structural, engineer, mile, nouguier, the, head, of, construction, jean, compagnon, the, president, of, the, city, council, and, reporters, from, le, figaro, and, le, monde, illustr, completed, the, ascent, at, 2, 35, pm, eiffel, hoisted, a, large, tricolour, to, the, accompaniment, of, a, 25, gun, salute, fired, at, the, first, level, there, was, still, work, to, be, done, particularly, on, the, lifts, and, facilities, and, the, tower, was, not, opened, to, the, public, until, nine, days, after, the, opening, of, the, exposition, on, 6, may, even, then, the, lifts, had, not, been, completed, the, tower, was, an, instant, success, with, the, public, and, nearly, 30, 000, visitors, made, the, 1, 710, step, climb, to, the, top, before, the, lifts, entered, service, on, 26, may, tickets, cost, 2, francs, for, the, first, level, 3, for, the, second, and, 5, for, the, top, with, half, price, admission, on, sundays, and, by, the, end, of, the, exhibition, there, had, been, 1, 896, 987, visitors, after, dark, the, tower, was, lit, by, hundreds, of, gas, lamps, and, a, beacon, sent, out, three, beams, of, red, white, and, blue, light, two, searchlights, mounted, on, a, circular, rail, were, used, to, illuminate, various, buildings, of, the, exposition, the, daily, opening, and, closing, of, the, exposition, were, announced, by, a, cannon, at, the, top, on, the, second, level, the, french, newspaper, le, figaro, had, an, office, and, a, printing, press, where, a, special, souvenir, edition, le, figaro, de, la, tour, was, made, at, the, top, there, was, a, post, office, where, visitors, could, send, letters, and, postcards, as, a, memento, of, their, visit, graffitists, were, also, catered, for, sheets, of, paper, were, mounted, on, the, walls, each, day, for, visitors, to, record, their, impressions, of, the, tower, gustave, eiffel, described, the, collection, of, responses, as, truly, curious, famous, visitors, to, the, tower, included, the, prince, of, wales, sarah, bernhardt, buffalo, bill, cody, his, wild, west, show, was, an, attraction, at, the, exposition, and, thomas, edison, eiffel, invited, edison, to, his, private, apartment, at, the, top, of, the, tower, where, edison, presented, him, with, one, of, his, phonographs, a, new, invention, and, one, of, the, many, highlights, of, the, exposition, edison, signed, the, guestbook, with, this, message, to, m, eiffel, the, engineer, the, brave, builder, of, so, gigantic, and, original, specimen, of, modern, engineering, from, one, who, has, the, greatest, respect, and, admiration, for, all, engineers, including, the, great, engineer, the, bon, dieu, thomas, edison, eiffel, made, use, of, his, apartment, at, the, top, of, the, tower, to, carry, out, meteorological, observations, and, also, used, the, tower, to, perform, experiments, on, the, action, of, air, resistance, on, falling, bodies, eiffel, had, a, permit, for, the, tower, to, stand, for, 20, years, it, was, to, be, dismantled, in, 1909, when, its, ownership, would, revert, to, the, city, of, paris, the, city, had, planned, to, tear, it, down, part, of, the, original, contest, rules, for, designing, a, tower, was, that, it, should, be, easy, to, dismantle, but, as, the, tower, proved, to, be, valuable, for, many, innovations, in, the, early, 20th, century, particularly, radio, telegraphy, it, was, allowed, to, remain, after, the, expiry, of, the, permit, and, from, 1910, it, also, became, part, of, the, international, time, service, for, the, 1900, exposition, universelle, the, lifts, in, the, east, and, west, legs, were, replaced, by, lifts, running, as, far, as, the, second, level, constructed, by, the, french, firm, fives, lille, these, had, a, compensating, mechanism, to, keep, the, floor, level, as, the, angle, of, ascent, changed, at, the, first, level, and, were, driven, by, a, similar, hydraulic, mechanism, as, the, otis, lifts, although, this, was, situated, at, the, base, of, the, tower, hydraulic, pressure, was, provided, by, pressurised, accumulators, located, near, this, mechanism, at, the, same, time, the, lift, in, the, north, pillar, was, removed, and, replaced, by, a, staircase, to, the, first, level, the, layout, of, both, first, and, second, levels, was, modified, with, the, space, available, for, visitors, on, the, second, level, the, original, lift, in, the, south, pillar, was, removed, 13, years, later, on, 19, october, 1901, alberto, santos, dumont, flying, his, no, 6, airship, won, a, 100, 000, franc, prize, offered, by, henri, deutsch, de, la, meurthe, for, the, first, person, to, make, a, flight, from, st, cloud, to, the, eiffel, tower, and, back, in, less, than, half, an, hour, in, 1910, father, theodor, wulf, measured, radiant, energy, at, the, top, and, bottom, of, the, tower, he, found, more, at, the, top, than, expected, incidentally, discovering, what, are, known, today, as, cosmic, rays, two, years, later, on, 4, february, 1912, austrian, tailor, franz, reichelt, died, after, jumping, from, the, first, level, of, the, tower, a, height, of, 57, m, to, demonstrate, his, parachute, design, in, 1914, at, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, a, radio, transmitter, located, in, the, tower, jammed, german, radio, communications, seriously, hindering, their, advance, on, paris, and, contributing, to, the, allied, victory, at, the, first, battle, of, the, marne, during, world, war, i, the, eiffel, tower, s, wireless, station, played, a, crucial, role, in, intercepting, enemy, communications, from, berlin, in, 1914, french, forces, successfully, launched, a, counter, attack, during, the, battle, of, the, marne, after, gaining, critical, intelligence, on, the, german, army, s, movements, in, 1917, the, station, intercepted, a, coded, message, between, germany, and, spain, that, referenced, operative, h, 21, this, information, contributed, to, the, arrest, conviction, and, execution, of, mata, hari, the, famous, spy, accused, of, working, for, germany, from, 1925, to, 1934, illuminated, signs, for, citro, n, adorned, three, of, the, tower, s, sides, making, it, the, tallest, advertising, space, in, the, world, at, the, time, in, april, 1935, the, tower, was, used, to, make, experimental, low, resolution, television, transmissions, using, a, shortwave, transmitter, of, 200, watts, power, on, 17, november, an, improved, 180, line, transmitter, was, installed, on, two, separate, but, related, occasions, in, 1925, the, con, artist, victor, lustig, sold, the, tower, for, scrap, metal, a, year, later, in, february, 1926, pilot, leon, collet, was, killed, trying, to, fly, under, the, tower, his, aircraft, became, entangled, in, an, aerial, belonging, to, a, wireless, station, a, bust, of, gustave, eiffel, by, antoine, bourdelle, was, unveiled, at, the, base, of, the, north, leg, on, 2, may, 1929, in, 1930, the, tower, lost, the, title, of, the, world, s, tallest, structure, when, the, chrysler, building, in, new, york, city, was, completed, in, 1938, the, decorative, arcade, around, the, first, level, was, removed, upon, the, german, occupation, of, paris, in, 1940, the, lift, cables, were, cut, by, the, french, the, tower, was, restricted, to, german, visitors, during, the, occupation, and, the, lifts, were, not, repaired, until, 1946, in, 1940, german, soldiers, had, to, climb, the, tower, to, hoist, a, swastika, centered, reichskriegsflagge, but, the, flag, was, so, large, it, blew, away, just, a, few, hours, later, and, was, replaced, by, a, smaller, one, when, visiting, paris, hitler, chose, to, stay, on, the, ground, when, the, allies, were, nearing, paris, in, august, 1944, hitler, ordered, general, dietrich, von, choltitz, the, military, governor, of, paris, to, demolish, the, tower, along, with, the, rest, of, the, city, von, choltitz, disobeyed, the, order, on, 25, august, before, the, germans, had, been, driven, out, of, paris, the, german, flag, was, replaced, with, a, tricolour, by, two, men, from, the, french, naval, museum, who, narrowly, beat, three, men, led, by, lucien, sarniguet, who, had, lowered, the, tricolour, on, 13, june, 1940, when, paris, fell, to, the, germans, a, fire, started, in, the, television, transmitter, on, 3, january, 1956, damaging, the, top, of, the, tower, repairs, took, a, year, and, in, 1957, the, present, radio, aerial, was, added, to, the, top, in, 1964, the, eiffel, tower, was, officially, declared, to, be, a, historical, monument, by, the, minister, of, cultural, affairs, andr, malraux, a, year, later, an, additional, lift, system, was, installed, in, the, north, pillar, according, to, interviews, in, 1967, montreal, mayor, jean, drapeau, negotiated, a, secret, agreement, with, charles, de, gaulle, for, the, tower, to, be, dismantled, and, temporarily, relocated, to, montreal, to, serve, as, a, landmark, and, tourist, attraction, during, expo, 67, the, plan, was, allegedly, vetoed, by, the, company, operating, the, tower, out, of, fear, that, the, french, government, could, refuse, permission, for, the, tower, to, be, restored, in, its, original, location, in, 1982, the, original, lifts, between, the, second, and, third, levels, were, replaced, after, 97, years, in, service, these, had, been, closed, to, the, public, between, november, and, march, because, the, water, in, the, hydraulic, drive, tended, to, freeze, the, new, cars, operate, in, pairs, with, one, counterbalancing, the, other, and, perform, the, journey, in, one, stage, reducing, the, journey, time, from, eight, minutes, to, less, than, two, minutes, at, the, same, time, two, new, emergency, staircases, were, installed, replacing, the, original, spiral, staircases, in, 1983, the, south, pillar, was, fitted, with, an, electrically, driven, otis, lift, to, serve, the, jules, verne, restaurant, the, fives, lille, lifts, in, the, east, and, west, legs, fitted, in, 1899, were, extensively, refurbished, in, 1986, the, cars, were, replaced, and, a, computer, system, was, installed, to, completely, automate, the, lifts, the, motive, power, was, moved, from, the, water, hydraulic, system, to, a, new, electrically, driven, oil, filled, hydraulic, system, and, the, original, water, hydraulics, were, retained, solely, as, a, counterbalance, system, a, service, lift, was, added, to, the, south, pillar, for, moving, small, loads, and, maintenance, personnel, three, years, later, robert, moriarty, flew, a, beechcraft, bonanza, under, the, tower, on, 31, march, 1984, in, 1987, a, j, hackett, made, one, of, his, first, bungee, jumps, from, the, top, of, the, eiffel, tower, using, a, special, cord, he, had, helped, develop, hackett, was, arrested, by, the, police, on, 27, october, 1991, thierry, devaux, along, with, mountain, guide, herv, calvayrac, performed, a, series, of, acrobatic, figures, while, bungee, jumping, from, the, second, floor, of, the, tower, facing, the, champ, de, mars, devaux, used, an, electric, winch, between, figures, to, go, back, up, to, the, second, floor, when, firemen, arrived, he, stopped, after, the, sixth, jump, for, its, countdown, to, the, year, 2000, celebration, on, 31, december, 1999, flashing, lights, and, high, powered, searchlights, were, installed, on, the, tower, during, the, last, three, minutes, of, the, year, the, lights, were, turned, on, starting, from, the, base, of, the, tower, and, continuing, to, the, top, to, welcome, 2000, with, a, huge, fireworks, show, an, exhibition, above, a, cafeteria, on, the, first, floor, commemorates, this, event, the, searchlights, on, top, of, the, tower, made, it, a, beacon, in, paris, s, night, sky, and, 20, 000, flashing, bulbs, gave, the, tower, a, sparkly, appearance, for, five, minutes, every, hour, on, the, hour, the, lights, sparkled, blue, for, several, nights, to, herald, the, new, millennium, on, 31, december, 2000, the, sparkly, lighting, continued, for, 18, months, until, july, 2001, the, sparkling, lights, were, turned, on, again, on, 21, june, 2003, and, the, display, was, planned, to, last, for, 10, years, before, they, needed, replacing, the, tower, received, its, 200, 000, 000th, guest, on, 28, november, 2002, the, tower, has, operated, at, its, maximum, capacity, of, about, 7, million, visitors, per, year, since, 2003, in, 2004, the, eiffel, tower, began, hosting, a, seasonal, ice, rink, on, the, first, level, a, glass, floor, was, installed, on, the, first, level, during, the, 2014, refurbishment, the, puddle, iron, wrought, iron, of, the, eiffel, tower, weighs, 7, 300, tonnes, and, the, addition, of, lifts, shops, and, antennae, have, brought, the, total, weight, to, approximately, 10, 100, tonnes, as, a, demonstration, of, the, economy, of, design, if, the, 7, 300, tonnes, of, metal, in, the, structure, were, melted, down, it, would, fill, the, square, base, 125, metres, 410, ft, on, each, side, to, a, depth, of, only, 6, 25, cm, 2, 46, in, assuming, the, density, of, the, metal, to, be, 7, 8, tonnes, per, cubic, metre, additionally, a, cubic, box, surrounding, the, tower, 324, m, 125, m, 125, m, would, contain, 6, 200, tonnes, of, air, weighing, almost, as, much, as, the, iron, itself, depending, on, the, ambient, temperature, the, top, of, the, tower, may, shift, away, from, the, sun, by, up, to, 18, cm, 7, in, due, to, thermal, expansion, of, the, metal, on, the, side, facing, the, sun, when, it, was, built, many, were, shocked, by, the, tower, s, daring, form, eiffel, was, accused, of, trying, to, create, something, artistic, with, no, regard, to, the, principles, of, engineering, however, eiffel, and, his, team, experienced, bridge, builders, understood, the, importance, of, wind, forces, and, knew, that, if, they, were, going, to, build, the, tallest, structure, in, the, world, they, had, to, be, sure, it, could, withstand, them, in, an, interview, with, the, newspaper, le, temps, published, on, 14, february, 1887, eiffel, said, is, it, not, true, that, the, very, conditions, which, give, strength, also, conform, to, the, hidden, rules, of, harmony, now, to, what, phenomenon, did, i, have, to, give, primary, concern, in, designing, the, tower, it, was, wind, resistance, well, then, i, hold, that, the, curvature, of, the, monument, s, four, outer, edges, which, is, as, mathematical, calculation, dictated, it, should, be, will, give, a, great, impression, of, strength, and, beauty, for, it, will, reveal, to, the, eyes, of, the, observer, the, boldness, of, the, design, as, a, whole, he, used, graphical, methods, to, determine, the, strength, of, the, tower, and, empirical, evidence, to, account, for, the, effects, of, wind, rather, than, a, mathematical, formula, close, examination, of, the, tower, reveals, a, basically, exponential, shape, all, parts, of, the, tower, were, overdesigned, to, ensure, maximum, resistance, to, wind, forces, the, top, half, was, even, assumed, to, have, no, gaps, in, the, latticework, in, the, years, since, it, was, completed, engineers, have, put, forward, various, mathematical, hypotheses, in, an, attempt, to, explain, the, success, of, the, design, the, most, recent, devised, in, 2004, after, letters, sent, by, eiffel, to, the, french, society, of, civil, engineers, in, 1885, were, translated, into, english, is, described, as, a, non, linear, integral, equation, based, on, counteracting, the, wind, pressure, on, any, point, of, the, tower, with, the, tension, between, the, construction, elements, at, that, point, the, eiffel, tower, sways, by, up, to, 9, cm, 3, 5, in, in, the, wind, the, four, columns, of, the, tower, each, house, access, stairs, and, elevators, to, the, first, two, floors, while, at, the, south, column, only, the, elevator, to, the, second, floor, restaurant, is, publicly, accessible, the, first, floor, is, publicly, accessible, by, elevator, or, stairs, when, originally, built, the, first, level, contained, three, restaurants, one, french, one, russian, and, one, flemish, and, an, anglo, american, bar, after, the, exposition, closed, the, flemish, restaurant, was, converted, to, a, 250, seat, theatre, today, there, is, the, le, 58, tour, eiffel, restaurant, and, other, facilities, the, second, floor, is, publicly, accessible, by, elevator, or, stairs, and, has, a, restaurant, called, le, jules, verne, a, gourmet, restaurant, with, its, own, lift, going, up, from, the, south, column, to, the, second, level, this, restaurant, has, one, star, in, the, michelin, red, guide, it, was, run, by, the, multi, michelin, star, chef, alain, ducasse, from, 2007, to, 2017, as, of, may, 2019, it, is, managed, by, three, star, chef, fr, d, ric, anton, it, owes, its, name, to, the, famous, science, fiction, writer, jules, verne, the, third, floor, is, the, top, floor, publicly, accessible, by, elevator, originally, there, were, laboratories, for, various, experiments, and, a, small, apartment, reserved, for, gustave, eiffel, to, entertain, guests, which, is, now, open, to, the, public, complete, with, period, decorations, and, lifelike, mannequins, of, eiffel, and, some, of, his, notable, guests, from, 1937, until, 1981, there, was, a, restaurant, near, the, top, of, the, tower, it, was, removed, due, to, structural, considerations, engineers, had, determined, it, was, too, heavy, and, was, causing, the, tower, to, sag, this, restaurant, was, sold, to, an, american, restaurateur, and, transported, to, new, york, and, then, new, orleans, it, was, rebuilt, on, the, edge, of, new, orleans, garden, district, as, a, restaurant, and, later, event, hall, today, there, is, a, champagne, bar, the, arrangement, of, the, lifts, has, been, changed, several, times, during, the, tower, s, history, given, the, elasticity, of, the, cables, and, the, time, taken, to, align, the, cars, with, the, landings, each, lift, in, normal, service, takes, an, average, of, 8, minutes, and, 50, seconds, to, do, the, round, trip, spending, an, average, of, 1, minute, and, 15, seconds, at, each, level, the, average, journey, time, between, levels, is, 1, minute, the, original, hydraulic, mechanism, is, on, public, display, in, a, small, museum, at, the, base, of, the, east, and, west, legs, because, the, mechanism, requires, frequent, lubrication, and, maintenance, public, access, is, often, restricted, the, rope, mechanism, of, the, north, tower, can, be, seen, as, visitors, exit, the, lift, equipping, the, tower, with, adequate, and, safe, passenger, lifts, was, a, major, concern, of, the, government, commission, overseeing, the, exposition, although, some, visitors, could, be, expected, to, climb, to, the, first, level, or, even, the, second, lifts, clearly, had, to, be, the, main, means, of, ascent, constructing, lifts, to, reach, the, first, level, was, relatively, straightforward, the, legs, were, wide, enough, at, the, bottom, and, so, nearly, straight, that, they, could, contain, a, straight, track, and, a, contract, was, given, to, the, french, company, roux, combaluzier, lepape, for, two, lifts, to, be, fitted, in, the, east, and, west, legs, roux, combaluzier, lepape, used, a, pair, of, endless, chains, with, rigid, articulated, links, to, which, the, car, was, attached, lead, weights, on, some, links, of, the, upper, or, return, sections, of, the, chains, counterbalanced, most, of, the, car, s, weight, the, car, was, pushed, up, from, below, not, pulled, up, from, above, to, prevent, the, chain, buckling, it, was, enclosed, in, a, conduit, at, the, bottom, of, the, run, the, chains, passed, around, 3, 9, m, 12, ft, 10, in, diameter, sprockets, smaller, sprockets, at, the, top, guided, the, chains, installing, lifts, to, the, second, level, was, more, of, a, challenge, because, a, straight, track, was, impossible, no, french, company, wanted, to, undertake, the, work, the, european, branch, of, otis, brothers, company, submitted, a, proposal, but, this, was, rejected, the, fair, s, charter, ruled, out, the, use, of, any, foreign, material, in, the, construction, of, the, tower, the, deadline, for, bids, was, extended, but, still, no, french, companies, put, themselves, forward, and, eventually, the, contract, was, given, to, otis, in, july, 1887, otis, were, confident, they, would, eventually, be, given, the, contract, and, had, already, started, creating, designs, the, car, was, divided, into, two, superimposed, compartments, each, holding, 25, passengers, with, the, lift, operator, occupying, an, exterior, platform, on, the, first, level, motive, power, was, provided, by, an, inclined, hydraulic, ram, 12, 67, m, 41, ft, 7, in, long, and, 96, 5, cm, 38, 0, in, in, diameter, in, the, tower, leg, with, a, stroke, of, 10, 83, m, 35, ft, 6, in, this, moved, a, carriage, carrying, six, sheaves, five, fixed, sheaves, were, mounted, higher, up, the, leg, producing, an, arrangement, similar, to, a, block, and, tackle, but, acting, in, reverse, multiplying, the, stroke, of, the, piston, rather, than, the, force, generated, the, hydraulic, pressure, in, the, driving, cylinder, was, produced, by, a, large, open, reservoir, on, the, second, level, after, being, exhausted, from, the, cylinder, the, water, was, pumped, back, up, to, the, reservoir, by, two, pumps, in, the, machinery, room, at, the, base, of, the, south, leg, this, reservoir, also, provided, power, to, the, lifts, to, the, first, level, the, original, lifts, for, the, journey, between, the, second, and, third, levels, were, supplied, by, l, on, edoux, a, pair, of, 81, m, 266, ft, hydraulic, rams, were, mounted, on, the, second, level, reaching, nearly, halfway, up, to, the, third, level, one, lift, car, was, mounted, on, top, of, these, rams, cables, ran, from, the, top, of, this, car, up, to, sheaves, on, the, third, level, and, back, down, to, a, second, car, each, car, travelled, only, half, the, distance, between, the, second, and, third, levels, and, passengers, were, required, to, change, lifts, halfway, by, means, of, a, short, gangway, the, 10, ton, cars, each, held, 65, passengers, gustave, eiffel, engraved, on, the, tower, the, names, of, 72, french, scientists, engineers, and, mathematicians, in, recognition, of, their, contributions, to, the, building, of, the, tower, eiffel, chose, this, invocation, of, science, because, of, his, concern, over, the, artists, protest, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, the, engravings, were, painted, over, but, they, were, restored, in, 1986, 87, by, the, soci, t, nouvelle, d, exploitation, de, la, tour, eiffel, a, company, operating, the, tower, the, tower, is, painted, in, three, shades, lighter, at, the, top, getting, progressively, darker, towards, the, bottom, to, complement, the, parisian, sky, it, was, originally, reddish, brown, this, changed, in, 1968, to, a, bronze, colour, known, as, eiffel, tower, brown, in, what, is, expected, to, be, a, temporary, change, the, tower, was, painted, gold, in, commemoration, of, the, 2024, summer, olympics, in, paris, following, the, 2024, summer, olympics, held, in, paris, mayor, anne, hidalgo, proposed, keeping, the, olympic, rings, on, the, tower, permanently, the, rings, which, measure, 95, feet, 29, m, wide, and, 43, feet, 13, m, high, were, initially, installed, for, the, games, and, were, scheduled, for, removal, after, the, paralympics, hidalgo, s, decision, faced, criticism, from, the, eiffel, family, and, some, residents, concerned, about, altering, the, protected, monument, the, original, 30, ton, rings, would, be, replaced, with, lighter, versions, for, long, term, display, the, only, non, structural, elements, are, the, four, decorative, grill, work, arches, added, in, sauvestre, s, sketches, which, served, to, make, the, tower, look, more, substantial, and, to, make, a, more, impressive, entrance, to, the, exposition, a, pop, culture, movie, clich, is, that, the, view, from, a, parisian, window, always, includes, the, tower, in, reality, since, zoning, restrictions, limit, the, height, of, most, buildings, in, paris, to, seven, storeys, only, a, small, number, of, tall, buildings, have, a, clear, view, of, the, tower, maintenance, of, the, tower, includes, applying, 60, tons, of, paint, every, seven, years, to, prevent, it, from, rusting, the, tower, has, been, completely, repainted, at, least, 19, times, since, it, was, built, with, the, most, recent, being, in, 2010, lead, paint, was, still, being, used, as, recently, as, 2001, when, the, practice, was, stopped, out, of, concern, for, the, environment, the, tower, has, been, used, for, making, radio, transmissions, since, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, until, the, 1950s, sets, of, aerial, wires, ran, from, the, cupola, to, anchors, on, the, avenue, de, suffren, and, champ, de, mars, these, were, connected, to, longwave, transmitters, in, small, bunkers, in, 1909, a, permanent, underground, radio, centre, was, built, near, the, south, pillar, which, still, exists, today, on, 20, november, 1913, the, paris, observatory, using, the, eiffel, tower, as, an, aerial, exchanged, wireless, signals, with, the, united, states, naval, observatory, which, used, an, aerial, in, arlington, county, virginia, the, object, of, the, transmissions, was, to, measure, the, difference, in, longitude, between, paris, and, washington, d, c, today, radio, and, digital, television, signals, are, transmitted, from, the, eiffel, tower, a, television, antenna, was, first, installed, on, the, tower, in, 1957, increasing, its, height, by, 18, 7, m, 61, ft, work, carried, out, in, 2000, added, a, further, 5, 3, m, 17, ft, giving, the, current, height, of, 324, m, 1, 063, ft, analogue, television, signals, from, the, eiffel, tower, ceased, on, 8, march, 2011, the, pinnacle, height, of, the, eiffel, tower, has, changed, multiple, times, over, the, years, as, described, in, the, chart, below, the, eiffel, tower, was, the, world, s, tallest, structure, when, completed, in, 1889, a, distinction, it, retained, until, 1929, when, the, chrysler, building, in, new, york, city, was, topped, out, the, tower, also, lost, its, standing, as, the, world, s, tallest, tower, to, the, tokyo, tower, in, 1958, but, retains, its, status, as, the, tallest, freestanding, non, guyed, structure, in, france, the, nearest, paris, m, tro, station, is, bir, hakeim, and, the, nearest, rer, station, is, champ, de, mars, tour, eiffel, the, tower, itself, is, located, at, the, intersection, of, the, quai, branly, and, the, pont, d, i, na, more, than, 300, million, people, have, visited, the, tower, since, it, was, completed, in, 1889, in, 2015, there, were, 6, 91, million, visitors, the, tower, is, the, most, visited, paid, monument, in, the, world, an, average, of, 25, 000, people, ascend, the, tower, every, day, which, can, result, in, long, queues, the, tower, and, its, image, have, been, in, the, public, domain, since, 1993, 70, years, after, eiffel, s, death, in, june, 1990, a, french, court, ruled, that, a, special, lighting, display, on, the, tower, in, 1989, to, mark, the, tower, s, 100th, anniversary, was, an, original, visual, creation, protected, by, copyright, the, court, of, cassation, france, s, judicial, court, of, last, resort, upheld, the, ruling, in, march, 1992, the, soci, t, d, exploitation, de, la, tour, eiffel, sete, now, considers, any, illumination, of, the, tower, to, be, a, separate, work, of, art, that, falls, under, copyright, as, a, result, the, snte, alleges, that, it, is, illegal, to, publish, contemporary, photographs, of, the, lit, tower, at, night, without, permission, in, france, and, some, other, countries, for, commercial, use, for, this, reason, it, is, often, rare, to, find, images, or, videos, of, the, lit, tower, at, night, on, stock, image, sites, and, media, outlets, rarely, broadcast, images, or, videos, of, it, the, imposition, of, copyright, has, been, controversial, the, director, of, documentation, for, what, was, then, called, the, soci, t, nouvelle, d, exploitation, de, la, tour, eiffel, snte, st, phane, dieu, commented, in, 2005, it, is, really, just, a, way, to, manage, commercial, use, of, the, image, so, that, it, isn, t, used, in, ways, we, don, t, approve, snte, made, over, 1, million, from, copyright, fees, in, 2002, however, it, could, also, be, used, to, restrict, the, publication, of, tourist, photographs, of, the, tower, at, night, as, well, as, hindering, non, profit, and, semi, commercial, publication, of, images, of, the, illuminated, tower, the, copyright, claim, itself, has, never, been, tested, in, courts, to, date, according, to, a, 2014, article, in, the, art, law, journal, and, there, has, never, been, an, attempt, to, track, down, millions, of, people, who, have, posted, and, shared, their, images, of, the, illuminated, tower, on, the, internet, worldwide, however, the, article, adds, that, commercial, uses, of, such, images, like, in, a, magazine, on, a, film, poster, or, on, product, packaging, may, require, prior, permission, french, doctrine, and, jurisprudence, allows, pictures, incorporating, a, copyrighted, work, as, long, as, their, presence, is, incidental, or, accessory, to, the, subject, being, represented, a, reasoning, akin, to, the, de, minimis, rule, therefore, sete, may, be, unable, to, claim, copyright, on, photographs, of, paris, which, happen, to, include, the, lit, tower, as, one, of, the, most, famous, landmarks, in, the, world, the, eiffel, tower, has, been, the, inspiration, for, the, creation, of, many, replicas, and, similar, towers, an, early, example, is, blackpool, tower, in, england, the, mayor, of, blackpool, sir, john, bickerstaffe, was, so, impressed, on, seeing, the, eiffel, tower, at, the, 1889, exposition, that, he, commissioned, a, similar, tower, to, be, built, in, his, town, it, opened, in, 1894, and, is, 158, 1, m, 519, ft, tall, tokyo, tower, in, japan, built, as, a, communications, tower, in, 1958, was, also, inspired, by, the, eiffel, tower, well, known, is, the, pet, n, lookout, tower, in, prague, too, there, are, various, scale, models, of, the, tower, in, the, united, states, including, a, half, scale, version, at, the, paris, las, vegas, nevada, one, in, paris, texas, built, in, 1993, and, two, 1, 3, scale, models, at, kings, island, located, in, mason, ohio, and, kings, dominion, virginia, amusement, parks, opened, in, 1972, and, 1975, respectively, two, 1, 3, scale, models, can, be, found, in, china, one, in, durango, mexico, that, was, donated, by, the, local, french, community, and, several, across, europe, in, 2011, the, tv, show, pricing, the, priceless, on, the, national, geographic, channel, speculated, that, a, full, size, replica, of, the, tower, would, cost, approximately, us, 480, million, to, build, this, would, be, more, than, ten, times, the, cost, of, the, original, nearly, 8, million, in, 1890, francs, us, 40, million, in, 2018, dollars
