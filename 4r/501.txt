futurism, italian, futurismo, was, an, artistic, and, social, movement, that, originated, in, italy, and, to, a, lesser, extent, in, other, countries, in, the, early, 20th, century, it, emphasized, dynamism, speed, technology, youth, violence, and, objects, such, as, the, car, the, airplane, and, the, industrial, city, its, key, figures, included, italian, artists, filippo, tommaso, marinetti, umberto, boccioni, carlo, carr, fortunato, depero, gino, severini, giacomo, balla, and, luigi, russolo, italian, futurism, glorified, modernity, and, according, to, its, doctrine, aimed, to, liberate, italy, from, the, weight, of, its, past, important, futurist, works, included, marinetti, s, 1909, manifesto, of, futurism, boccioni, s, 1913, sculpture, unique, forms, of, continuity, in, space, balla, s, 1913, 1914, painting, abstract, speed, sound, and, russolo, s, the, art, of, noises, 1913, although, futurism, was, largely, an, italian, phenomenon, parallel, movements, emerged, in, russia, where, some, russian, futurists, would, later, go, on, to, found, groups, of, their, own, other, countries, either, had, a, few, futurists, or, had, movements, inspired, by, futurism, the, futurists, practiced, in, every, medium, of, art, including, painting, sculpture, ceramics, graphic, design, industrial, design, interior, design, urban, design, theatre, film, fashion, textiles, literature, music, architecture, and, even, cooking, to, some, extent, futurism, influenced, the, art, movements, art, deco, constructivism, surrealism, and, dada, to, a, greater, degree, precisionism, rayonism, and, vorticism, pass, ism, can, represent, an, opposing, trend, or, attitude, futurism, is, an, avant, garde, movement, founded, in, milan, in, 1909, by, the, italian, poet, filippo, tommaso, marinetti, marinetti, launched, the, movement, in, his, manifesto, of, futurism, which, he, published, for, the, first, time, on, 5, february, 1909, in, la, gazzetta, dell, emilia, an, article, then, reproduced, in, the, french, daily, newspaper, le, figaro, on, saturday, 20, february, 1909, he, was, soon, joined, by, the, painters, umberto, boccioni, carlo, carr, giacomo, balla, gino, severini, and, the, composer, luigi, russolo, marinetti, expressed, a, passionate, loathing, of, everything, old, especially, political, and, artistic, tradition, we, want, no, part, of, it, the, past, he, wrote, we, the, young, and, strong, futurists, the, futurists, admired, speed, technology, youth, and, violence, the, car, the, airplane, and, the, industrial, city, all, that, represented, the, technological, triumph, of, humanity, over, nature, and, they, were, passionate, nationalists, they, repudiated, the, cult, of, the, past, and, all, imitation, praised, originality, however, daring, however, violent, bore, proudly, the, smear, of, madness, dismissed, art, critics, as, useless, rebelled, against, harmony, and, good, taste, swept, away, all, the, themes, and, subjects, of, all, previous, art, and, glorified, science, publishing, manifestos, was, a, feature, of, futurism, and, the, futurists, usually, led, or, prompted, by, marinetti, wrote, them, on, many, topics, including, painting, architecture, music, literature, theatre, cinema, photography, religion, women, fashion, and, cuisine, in, their, manifestos, futurists, described, their, beliefs, and, appreciations, of, various, methods, they, also, detailed, their, disdain, for, traditional, italian, renaissance, works, of, art, and, their, subjects, according, to, the, manifesto, of, the, futurist, painters, 1910, by, umberto, boccioni, luigi, russolo, gino, severini, giacomo, balla, and, carlo, carr, we, want, to, fight, implacably, against, the, mindless, snobbish, and, fanatical, religion, of, the, past, religion, nurtured, by, the, pernicious, existence, of, the, museums, we, rebel, against, the, spineless, admiration, for, old, canvases, old, statues, and, old, objects, and, against, the, enthusiasm, for, everything, worm, eaten, grimy, or, corroded, by, time, and, we, deem, it, unjust, and, criminal, that, people, habitually, disdain, whatever, is, young, new, and, trembling, with, life, the, futurists, believed, that, art, should, be, inspired, by, the, modern, marvels, of, their, newly, technological, world, just, as, our, forebears, took, the, subject, of, art, from, the, religious, atmosphere, that, enveloped, them, so, we, must, draw, inspiration, from, the, tangible, miracles, of, contemporary, life, the, founding, manifesto, did, not, contain, a, positive, artistic, programme, which, the, futurists, attempted, to, create, in, their, subsequent, technical, manifesto, of, futurist, painting, published, in, italian, as, a, leaflet, by, poesia, milan, 11, april, 1910, this, committed, them, to, a, universal, dynamism, which, was, to, be, directly, represented, in, painting, objects, in, reality, were, not, separate, from, one, another, or, from, their, surroundings, the, sixteen, people, around, you, in, a, rolling, motor, bus, are, in, turn, and, at, the, same, time, one, ten, four, three, they, are, motionless, and, they, change, places, the, motor, bus, rushes, into, the, houses, which, it, passes, and, in, their, turn, the, houses, throw, themselves, upon, the, motor, bus, and, are, blended, with, it, the, futurist, painters, were, slow, to, develop, a, distinctive, style, and, subject, matter, in, 1910, and, 1911, they, used, the, techniques, of, divisionism, breaking, light, and, color, down, into, a, field, of, stippled, dots, and, stripes, which, had, been, adopted, from, divisionism, by, giovanni, segantini, and, others, later, severini, who, lived, in, paris, attributed, their, backwardness, in, style, and, method, at, this, time, to, their, distance, from, paris, the, centre, of, avant, garde, art, cubism, contributed, to, the, formation, of, italian, futurism, s, artistic, style, severini, was, the, first, to, come, into, contact, with, cubism, and, following, a, visit, to, paris, in, 1911, the, futurist, painters, adopted, the, methods, of, the, cubists, cubism, offered, them, a, means, of, analyzing, energy, in, paintings, and, expressing, dynamism, they, often, painted, modern, urban, scenes, carr, s, funeral, of, the, anarchist, galli, 1910, 11, is, a, large, canvas, representing, events, that, the, artist, himself, had, been, involved, with, in, 1904, the, action, of, a, police, attack, and, riot, is, rendered, energetically, with, diagonals, and, broken, planes, his, leaving, the, theatre, 1910, 11, uses, a, divisionist, technique, to, render, isolated, and, faceless, figures, trudging, home, at, night, under, street, lights, boccioni, s, the, city, rises, 1910, represents, scenes, of, construction, and, manual, labour, with, a, huge, rearing, red, horse, in, the, centre, foreground, which, workmen, struggle, to, control, his, states, of, mind, in, three, large, panels, the, farewell, those, who, go, and, those, who, stay, made, his, first, great, statement, of, futurist, painting, bringing, his, interests, in, bergson, cubism, and, the, individual, s, complex, experience, of, the, modern, world, together, in, what, has, been, described, as, one, of, the, minor, masterpieces, of, early, twentieth, century, painting, the, work, attempts, to, convey, feelings, and, sensations, experienced, in, time, using, new, means, of, expression, including, lines, of, force, which, intend, to, convey, the, directional, tendencies, of, objects, through, space, simultaneity, which, combines, memories, present, impressions, and, anticipation, of, future, events, and, emotional, ambience, in, which, the, artist, seeks, by, intuition, to, link, sympathies, between, the, exterior, scene, and, interior, emotion, boccioni, s, intentions, in, art, were, strongly, influenced, by, the, ideas, of, bergson, including, the, idea, of, intuition, which, bergson, defined, as, a, simple, indivisible, experience, of, sympathy, through, which, one, is, moved, into, the, inner, being, of, an, object, to, grasp, what, is, unique, and, ineffable, within, it, the, futurists, aimed, through, their, art, thus, to, enable, the, viewer, to, apprehend, the, inner, being, of, what, they, depicted, boccioni, developed, these, ideas, at, length, in, his, book, pittura, scultura, futuriste, dinamismo, plastico, futurist, painting, sculpture, plastic, dynamism, 1914, balla, s, dynamism, of, a, dog, on, a, leash, 1912, exemplifies, the, futurists, insistence, that, the, perceived, world, is, in, constant, movement, the, painting, depicts, a, dog, whose, legs, tail, and, leash, and, the, feet, of, the, woman, walking, it, have, been, multiplied, to, a, blur, of, movement, it, illustrates, the, precepts, of, the, technical, manifesto, of, futurist, painting, that, on, account, of, the, persistency, of, an, image, upon, the, retina, moving, objects, constantly, multiply, themselves, their, form, changes, like, rapid, vibrations, in, their, mad, career, thus, a, running, horse, has, not, four, legs, but, twenty, and, their, movements, are, triangular, his, rhythm, of, the, bow, 1912, similarly, depicts, the, movements, of, a, violinist, s, hand, and, instrument, rendered, in, rapid, strokes, within, a, triangular, frame, the, adoption, of, cubism, determined, the, style, of, much, subsequent, futurist, painting, which, boccioni, and, severini, in, particular, continued, to, render, in, the, broken, colors, and, short, brush, strokes, of, divisionism, but, futurist, painting, differed, in, both, subject, matter, and, treatment, from, the, quiet, and, static, cubism, of, picasso, braque, and, gris, as, the, art, critic, robert, hughes, observed, in, futurism, the, eye, is, fixed, and, the, object, moves, but, it, is, still, the, basic, vocabulary, of, cubism, fragmented, and, overlapping, planes, futurist, art, tended, to, disdain, traditional, subjects, specifically, those, of, photographically, realistic, portraits, and, landscapes, futurists, thought, of, imitation, art, that, copied, from, life, to, be, lazy, unimaginative, cowardly, and, boring, while, there, were, futurist, portraits, carr, s, woman, with, absinthe, 1911, severini, s, self, portrait, 1912, and, boccioni, s, matter, 1912, it, was, the, urban, scene, and, vehicles, in, motion, that, typified, futurist, painting, boccioni, s, the, street, enters, the, house, 1911, severini, s, dynamic, hieroglyph, of, the, bal, tabarin, 1912, and, russolo, s, automobile, at, speed, 1913, for, example, the, futurists, held, their, first, exhibition, outside, of, italy, in, 1912, at, the, bernheim, jeune, gallery, paris, which, included, works, by, umberto, boccioni, gino, severini, carlo, carr, luigi, russolo, and, giacomo, balla, in, 1912, and, 1913, boccioni, turned, to, sculpture, to, translate, into, three, dimensions, his, futurist, ideas, in, unique, forms, of, continuity, in, space, 1913, he, attempted, to, realize, the, relationship, between, the, object, and, its, environment, which, was, central, to, his, theory, of, dynamism, the, sculpture, represents, a, striding, figure, cast, in, bronze, posthumously, and, exhibited, in, the, tate, modern, it, now, appears, on, the, national, side, of, italian, 20, eurocent, coins, he, explored, the, theme, further, in, synthesis, of, human, dynamism, 1912, speeding, muscles, 1913, and, spiral, expansion, of, speeding, muscles, 1913, his, ideas, on, sculpture, were, published, in, the, technical, manifesto, of, futurist, sculpture, in, 1915, balla, also, turned, to, sculpture, making, abstract, reconstructions, which, were, created, out, of, various, materials, were, apparently, moveable, and, even, made, noises, he, said, that, after, making, twenty, pictures, in, which, he, had, studied, the, velocity, of, automobiles, he, understood, that, the, single, plane, of, the, canvas, did, not, permit, the, suggestion, of, the, dynamic, volume, of, speed, in, depth, i, felt, the, need, to, construct, the, first, dynamic, plastic, complex, with, iron, wires, cardboard, planes, cloth, and, tissue, paper, etc, in, 1914, personal, quarrels, and, artistic, differences, between, the, milan, group, around, marinetti, boccioni, and, balla, and, the, florence, group, around, carr, ardengo, soffici, 1879, 1964, and, giovanni, papini, 1881, 1956, created, a, rift, in, italian, futurism, the, florence, group, resented, the, dominance, of, marinetti, and, boccioni, whom, they, accused, of, trying, to, establish, an, immobile, church, with, an, infallible, creed, and, each, group, dismissed, the, other, as, pass, iste, futurism, had, from, the, outset, admired, violence, and, was, intensely, patriotic, the, futurist, manifesto, had, declared, we, will, glorify, war, the, world, s, only, hygiene, militarism, patriotism, the, destructive, gesture, of, freedom, bringers, beautiful, ideas, worth, dying, for, and, scorn, for, woman, although, it, owed, much, of, its, character, and, some, of, its, ideas, to, radical, political, movements, it, was, not, much, involved, in, politics, until, the, autumn, of, 1913, then, fearing, the, re, election, of, giolitti, marinetti, published, a, political, manifesto, in, 1914, the, futurists, began, to, campaign, actively, against, the, austro, hungarian, empire, which, still, controlled, some, italian, territories, and, italian, neutrality, between, the, major, powers, in, september, boccioni, seated, in, the, balcony, of, the, teatro, dal, verme, in, milan, tore, up, an, austrian, flag, and, threw, it, into, the, audience, while, marinetti, waved, an, italian, flag, when, italy, entered, the, first, world, war, in, 1915, many, futurists, enlisted, the, experience, of, the, war, marked, several, futurists, particularly, marinetti, who, fought, in, the, mountains, of, trentino, at, the, border, of, italy, and, austria, hungary, actively, engaging, in, propaganda, italian, futurists, included, visual, poetry, in, futurist, periodicals, to, promote, their, cause, or, campaign, thus, swaying, public, opinion, in, their, favor, after, the, war, the, combat, experience, also, influenced, futurist, music, the, outbreak, of, war, disguised, the, fact, that, italian, futurism, had, come, to, an, end, the, florence, group, had, formally, acknowledged, their, withdrawal, from, the, movement, by, the, end, of, 1914, boccioni, produced, only, one, war, picture, and, was, killed, in, 1916, severini, painted, some, significant, war, pictures, in, 1915, e, g, war, armored, train, and, red, cross, train, but, in, paris, turned, towards, cubism, post, war, he, was, associated, with, the, return, to, order, after, the, war, marinetti, revived, the, movement, this, revival, was, called, il, secondo, futurismo, second, futurism, by, writers, in, the, 1960s, the, art, historian, giovanni, lista, groups, futurism, into, three, distinct, decades, according, to, characteristics, of, each, plastic, dynamism, of, the, 1910s, mechanical, art, of, the, 1920s, and, aeroaesthetics, of, the, 1930s, russian, futurism, was, a, movement, of, literature, and, the, visual, arts, involving, various, futurist, groups, the, russian, association, of, proletarian, writers, were, associated, with, russian, futurists, during, the, 1920s, in, relation, to, the, futurists, theory, literature, of, fact, in, which, soviet, art, can, be, expressed, through, literacy, evolution, the, poet, vladimir, mayakovsky, was, a, prominent, member, of, the, movement, as, were, velimir, khlebnikov, and, aleksei, kruchyonykh, visual, artists, such, as, david, burliuk, mikhail, larionov, natalia, goncharova, lyubov, popova, and, kazimir, malevich, found, inspiration, in, the, imagery, of, futurist, writings, and, were, writers, themselves, poets, and, painters, collaborated, on, theatre, production, such, as, the, futurist, opera, victory, over, the, sun, with, texts, by, kruchenykh, music, by, mikhail, matyushin, and, sets, by, malevich, the, main, style, of, painting, was, cubo, futurism, extant, during, the, 1910s, cubo, futurism, combines, the, forms, of, cubism, with, the, futurist, representation, of, movement, like, their, italian, contemporaries, the, russian, futurists, were, fascinated, with, dynamism, speed, and, the, restlessness, of, modern, urban, life, however, they, were, the, complete, opposite, of, them, ideologically, as, many, embraced, the, political, and, social, visions, of, the, emerging, communist, movement, in, russia, the, russian, futurists, sought, controversy, by, repudiating, the, art, of, the, past, saying, that, pushkin, and, dostoevsky, should, be, heaved, overboard, from, the, steamship, of, modernity, they, acknowledged, no, authority, and, professed, not, to, owe, anything, even, to, marinetti, as, they, abhorred, his, commitment, to, fascism, and, most, of, them, obstructed, him, when, he, came, to, russia, to, proselytize, in, 1914, the, movement, began, to, decline, after, the, revolution, of, 1917, the, futurists, either, stayed, were, persecuted, or, left, the, country, popova, mayakovsky, and, malevich, became, part, of, the, soviet, establishment, and, the, brief, agitprop, movement, of, the, 1920s, popova, died, of, a, fever, malevich, would, be, briefly, imprisoned, and, forced, to, paint, in, the, new, state, approved, style, and, mayakovsky, committed, suicide, on, april, 14, 1930, the, futurist, architect, antonio, sant, elia, expressed, his, ideas, of, modernity, in, his, drawings, for, la, citt, nuova, the, new, city, 1912, 1914, this, project, was, never, built, and, sant, elia, was, killed, in, the, first, world, war, but, his, ideas, influenced, later, generations, of, architects, and, artists, the, city, was, a, backdrop, onto, which, the, dynamism, of, futurist, life, was, projected, the, city, had, replaced, the, landscape, as, the, setting, for, the, exciting, modern, life, sant, elia, aimed, to, create, a, city, as, an, efficient, fast, paced, machine, he, manipulated, light, and, shape, to, emphasize, the, sculptural, quality, of, his, projects, baroque, curves, and, encrustations, had, been, stripped, away, to, reveal, the, essential, lines, of, forms, unprecedented, from, their, simplicity, in, the, new, city, every, aspect, of, life, was, to, be, rationalized, and, centralized, into, one, great, powerhouse, of, energy, the, city, was, not, meant, to, last, and, each, subsequent, generation, was, expected, to, build, their, own, city, rather, than, inheriting, the, architecture, of, the, past, futurist, architects, were, sometimes, at, odds, with, the, fascist, state, s, tendency, towards, roman, imperial, classical, aesthetic, patterns, nevertheless, several, futurist, buildings, were, built, in, the, years, 1920, 1940, including, public, buildings, such, as, railway, stations, maritime, resorts, and, post, offices, examples, of, futurist, buildings, still, in, use, today, are, trento, railway, station, built, by, angiolo, mazzoni, and, the, santa, maria, novella, station, in, florence, the, florence, station, was, designed, in, 1932, by, the, gruppo, toscano, tuscan, group, of, architects, which, included, giovanni, michelucci, and, italo, gamberini, with, contributions, by, mazzoni, futurist, music, rejected, tradition, and, introduced, experimental, sounds, inspired, by, machinery, and, would, influence, several, 20th, century, composers, francesco, balilla, pratella, joined, the, futurist, movement, in, 1910, and, wrote, a, manifesto, of, futurist, musicians, in, which, he, appealed, to, the, young, as, had, marinetti, because, only, they, could, understand, what, he, had, to, say, according, to, pratella, italian, music, was, inferior, to, music, abroad, he, praised, the, sublime, genius, of, wagner, and, saw, some, value, in, the, work, of, other, contemporary, composers, richard, strauss, elgar, mussorgsky, and, sibelius, for, example, by, contrast, the, italian, symphony, was, dominated, by, opera, in, an, absurd, and, anti, musical, form, the, conservatory, was, said, to, encourage, backwardness, and, mediocrity, the, publishers, perpetuated, mediocrity, and, the, domination, of, music, by, the, rickety, and, vulgar, operas, of, puccini, and, umberto, giordano, the, only, italian, pratella, could, praise, was, his, teacher, pietro, mascagni, because, he, had, rebelled, against, the, publishers, and, attempted, innovation, in, opera, but, even, mascagni, was, too, traditional, for, pratella, s, tastes, in, the, face, of, this, mediocrity, and, conservatism, pratella, unfurled, the, red, flag, of, futurism, calling, to, its, flaming, symbol, such, young, composers, as, have, hearts, to, love, and, fight, minds, to, conceive, and, brows, free, of, cowardice, luigi, russolo, 1885, 1947, wrote, the, art, of, noises, 1913, an, influential, text, in, 20th, century, musical, aesthetics, russolo, used, instruments, he, called, intonarumori, which, were, acoustic, noise, generators, that, permitted, the, performer, to, create, and, control, the, dynamics, and, pitch, of, several, different, types, of, noises, russolo, and, marinetti, gave, the, first, concert, of, futurist, music, complete, with, intonarumori, in, 1914, however, they, were, prevented, from, performing, in, many, major, european, cities, by, the, outbreak, of, war, futurism, was, one, of, several, 20th, century, movements, in, art, and, music, that, paid, homage, to, included, or, imitated, machines, ferruccio, busoni, has, been, seen, as, anticipating, some, futurist, ideas, though, he, remained, wed, to, tradition, russolo, s, intonarumori, influenced, stravinsky, arthur, honegger, george, antheil, edgar, var, se, stockhausen, and, john, cage, in, pacific, 231, honegger, imitated, the, sound, of, a, steam, locomotive, there, are, also, futurist, elements, in, prokofiev, s, the, steel, step, as, well, as, his, second, symphony, most, notable, in, this, respect, however, is, american, artist, george, antheil, his, fascination, with, machinery, is, evident, in, his, airplane, sonata, death, of, the, machines, and, the, 30, minute, ballet, m, canique, the, ballet, m, canique, was, originally, intended, to, accompany, an, experimental, film, by, fernand, l, ger, but, the, musical, score, is, twice, the, length, of, the, film, and, now, stands, alone, the, score, calls, for, a, percussion, ensemble, consisting, of, three, xylophones, four, bass, drums, a, tam, tam, three, airplane, propellers, seven, electric, bells, a, siren, two, live, pianists, and, sixteen, synchronized, player, pianos, antheil, s, piece, was, the, first, to, synchronize, machines, with, human, players, and, to, exploit, the, difference, between, what, machines, and, humans, can, play, the, futuristic, movement, also, influenced, the, concept, of, dance, indeed, dancing, was, interpreted, as, an, alternative, way, of, expressing, man, s, ultimate, fusion, with, the, machine, the, altitude, of, a, flying, plane, the, power, of, a, car, s, motor, and, the, roaring, loud, sounds, of, complex, machinery, were, all, signs, of, man, s, intelligence, and, excellence, which, the, art, of, dance, had, to, emphasize, and, praise, this, type, of, dance, is, considered, futuristic, as, it, disrupts, the, referential, system, of, traditional, classical, dance, and, introduces, a, different, style, new, to, the, sophisticated, bourgeois, audience, the, dancer, no, longer, performs, a, story, with, clear, content, that, can, be, read, according, to, the, rules, of, ballet, one, of, the, most, notable, futuristic, dancers, is, italian, artist, giannina, censi, she, was, inspired, by, the, arial, themes, in, the, second, wave, of, futurism, and, sought, to, put, in, on, the, stage, trained, as, a, classical, ballerina, she, is, known, for, her, aerodanze, and, continued, to, earn, her, living, by, performing, in, classical, and, popular, productions, she, describes, this, innovative, form, of, dance, as, the, result, of, a, deep, collaboration, with, marinetti, and, his, poetry, i, launched, this, idea, of, the, aerial, futurist, poetry, with, marinetti, he, himself, declaiming, the, poetry, a, small, stage, of, a, few, square, meters, i, made, myself, a, satin, costume, with, a, helmet, everything, that, the, plane, did, had, to, be, expressed, by, my, body, it, flew, and, moreover, it, gave, the, impression, of, these, wings, that, trembled, of, the, apparatus, that, trembled, and, the, face, had, to, express, what, the, pilot, felt, futurism, as, a, literary, movement, made, its, official, debut, with, f, t, marinetti, s, manifesto, of, futurism, 1909, as, it, delineated, the, various, ideals, futurist, poetry, should, strive, for, poetry, the, predominant, medium, of, futurist, literature, can, be, characterized, by, its, unexpected, combinations, of, images, and, hyper, conciseness, not, to, be, confused, with, the, actual, length, of, the, poem, the, futurists, called, their, style, of, poetry, parole, in, libert, word, autonomy, in, which, all, ideas, of, meter, were, rejected, and, the, word, became, the, main, unit, of, concern, in, this, way, the, futurists, managed, to, create, a, new, language, free, of, syntax, punctuation, and, metrics, that, allowed, for, free, expression, theater, also, has, an, important, place, within, the, futurist, universe, works, in, this, genre, have, scenes, that, are, few, sentences, long, have, an, emphasis, on, nonsensical, humor, and, attempt, to, discredit, the, deep, rooted, traditions, via, parody, and, other, devaluation, techniques, there, are, a, number, of, examples, of, futurist, novels, from, both, the, initial, period, of, futurism, and, the, neo, futurist, period, from, marinetti, himself, to, a, number, of, lesser, known, futurists, such, as, primo, conti, ardengo, soffici, and, bruno, giordano, sanzin, zig, zag, il, romanzo, futurista, edited, by, alessandro, masi, 1995, they, are, very, diverse, in, style, with, very, little, recourse, to, the, characteristics, of, futurist, poetry, such, as, parole, in, libert, arnaldo, ginna, s, le, locomotive, con, le, calze, trains, with, socks, on, plunges, into, a, world, of, absurd, nonsense, childishly, crude, his, brother, bruno, corra, wrote, in, sam, dunn,

rises, above, the, other, novels, through, the, strength, and, pervasiveness, of, its, irony, science, fiction, novels, play, an, important, role, in, futurist, literature, italian, futurist, cinema, italian, cinema, futurista, pronounced, was, the, oldest, movement, of, european, avant, garde, cinema, italian, futurism, an, artistic, and, social, movement, impacted, the, italian, film, industry, from, 1916, 1919, it, influenced, russian, futurist, cinema, and, german, expressionist, cinema, its, cultural, importance, was, considerable, and, influenced, all, subsequent, avant, gardes, as, well, as, some, authors, of, narrative, cinema, its, echo, expands, to, the, dreamlike, visions, of, some, films, by, alfred, hitchcock, most, of, the, futuristic, themed, films, of, this, period, have, been, lost, but, critics, cite, tha, s, 1917, by, anton, giulio, bragaglia, as, one, of, the, most, influential, serving, as, the, main, inspiration, for, german, expressionist, cinema, in, the, following, decade, tha, s, was, born, on, the, basis, of, the, aesthetic, treatise, fotodinamismo, futurista, 1911, written, by, the, same, author, the, film, built, around, a, melodramatic, and, decadent, story, actually, reveals, multiple, artistic, influences, different, from, marinett, s, futurism, the, secessionist, scenographies, the, liberty, furniture, and, the, abstract, and, surreal, moments, contribute, to, create, a, strong, formal, syncretism, the, amalgamation, or, attempted, amalgamation, of, different, religions, cultures, or, schools, of, thought, tha, s, is, the, only, surviving, example, of, the, 1910s, italian, futurist, cinema, to, date, 35, minutes, of, the, original, 70, when, interviewed, about, her, favorite, film, of, all, times, famed, movie, critic, pauline, kael, stated, that, the, director, dimitri, kirsanoff, in, his, silent, experimental, film, m, nilmontant, developed, a, technique, that, suggests, the, movement, known, in, painting, as, futurism, within, f, t, marinetti, s, the, founding, and, manifesto, of, futurism, two, of, his, tenets, briefly, highlight, his, hatred, for, women, under, the, pretense, that, it, fuels, the, futurist, movement, s, visceral, nature, 9, we, intend, to, glorify, war, the, only, hygiene, of, the, world, militarism, patriotism, the, destructive, gesture, of, anarchists, beautiful, ideas, worth, dying, for, and, contempt, for, woman, 10, we, intend, to, destroy, museums, libraries, academics, of, every, sort, and, to, fight, against, moralism, feminism, and, every, utilitarian, opportunistic, cowardice, marinetti, would, begin, to, contradict, himself, when, in, 1911, he, called, luisa, marchesa, casati, a, futurist, he, dedicated, a, portrait, of, himself, painted, by, carr, to, her, the, dedication, declaring, casati, as, a, futurist, being, pasted, on, the, canvas, itself, casati, affluent, host, of, parties, in, support, of, the, futurist, artists, in, marinetti, s, circle, was, thought, to, be, the, muse, of, several, of, them, including, bragaglia, and, balla, journalist, eugenio, giovanetti, would, also, declare, her, the, spirit, protector, of, futurist, art, in, 1918, as, she, had, become, one, of, italy, s, leading, collectors, in, 1912, only, three, years, after, the, manifesto, of, futurism, was, published, valentine, de, saint, point, responded, to, marinetti, s, claims, in, her, manifesto, of, the, futurist, woman, response, to, f, t, marinetti, marinetti, even, later, referred, to, her, as, the, first, futurist, woman, her, manifesto, begins, with, a, misanthropic, tone, by, presenting, how, men, and, women, are, equal, and, both, deserve, contempt, she, instead, suggests, that, rather, than, the, binary, being, limited, to, men, and, women, it, should, be, replaced, with, femininity, and, masculinity, ample, cultures, and, individuals, should, possess, elements, of, both, yet, she, still, embraces, the, core, values, of, futurism, especially, its, focus, on, virility, and, brutality, saint, point, uses, this, as, a, segue, into, her, antifeminist, argument, giving, women, equal, rights, destroys, their, innate, potency, to, strive, for, a, better, more, fulfilling, life, in, 1913, saint, point, further, expressed, her, desire, for, women, to, have, erotic, freedom, when, writing, the, futurist, manifesto, of, lust, however, it, has, also, been, noted, that, both, manifestos, favored, men, specifically, those, deemed, heroic, contrasting, with, her, ideas, about, shared, human, characteristics, also, present, in, the, manifestos, in, russian, futurist, and, cubo, futurist, circles, however, there, was, a, higher, percentage, of, women, participants, than, in, italy, from, the, start, natalia, goncharova, aleksandra, ekster, and, lyubov, popova, are, some, examples, of, major, female, futurists, although, marinetti, expressed, his, approval, of, olga, rozanova, s, paintings, during, his, 1914, lecture, tour, of, russia, it, is, possible, that, the, women, painters, negative, reaction, to, the, said, tour, may, have, largely, been, due, to, his, misogyny, as, well, as, his, explicit, support, for, fascism, despite, the, chauvinistic, nature, of, the, italian, futurist, program, many, serious, professional, female, artists, adopted, the, style, especially, so, after, the, end, of, the, first, world, war, notably, among, these, female, futurists, is, f, t, marinetti, s, own, wife, benedetta, cappa, marinetti, whom, he, had, met, in, 1918, and, exchanged, a, series, of, letters, discussing, each, of, their, respective, work, in, futurism, letters, continued, to, be, exchanged, between, the, two, with, f, t, marinetti, often, complimenting, benedetta, the, single, name, she, was, best, known, as, on, her, genius, in, a, letter, dated, august, 16, 1919, marinetti, wrote, to, benedetta, do, not, forget, your, promise, to, work, you, must, carry, your, genius, to, its, ultimate, splendor, every, day, although, many, of, benedetta, s, paintings, were, exhibited, in, major, italian, exhibitions, the, 1930, 1936, venice, biennales, in, which, she, was, the, first, woman, to, have, her, art, displayed, since, the, exhibition, s, founding, in, 1895, the, 1935, rome, quadriennale, and, several, other, futurist, exhibitions, she, was, often, overshadowed, in, her, work, by, her, husband, the, first, introduction, of, benedetta, s, feminist, convictions, regarding, futurism, is, in, the, form, of, a, public, dialogue, in, 1925, with, an, l, r, cannonieri, concerning, the, role, of, women, in, society, benedetta, was, also, one, of, the, first, to, paint, in, aeropittura, an, abstract, and, futurist, art, style, of, landscape, from, the, view, of, an, airplane, giannina, censi, was, the, first, exponent, of, aerodanze, similar, to, aeropittura, this, was, a, second, wave, futurist, dance, style, based, in, the, fascination, with, aviation, in, 1931, censi, was, accompanied, by, f, t, marinetti, in, a, dance, tour, entitled, simultanina, many, italian, futurists, supported, fascism, in, the, hope, of, modernizing, a, country, divided, between, the, industrialising, north, and, the, rural, archaic, south, like, the, fascists, the, futurists, were, italian, nationalists, laborers, disgruntled, war, veterans, radicals, admirers, of, violence, and, opposed, to, parliamentary, democracy, marinetti, founded, the, futurist, political, party, partito, politico, futurista, in, early, 1918, which, was, absorbed, into, benito, mussolini, s, fasci, italiani, di, combattimento, in, 1919, making, marinetti, one, of, the, first, members, of, the, national, fascist, party, he, opposed, fascism, s, later, exaltation, of, existing, institutions, calling, them, reactionary, and, walked, out, of, the, 1920, fascist, party, congress, in, disgust, withdrawing, from, politics, for, three, years, but, he, supported, italian, fascism, until, his, death, in, 1944, the, futurists, association, with, fascism, after, its, triumph, in, 1922, brought, them, official, acceptance, in, italy, and, the, ability, to, carry, out, important, work, especially, in, architecture, after, the, second, world, war, many, futurist, artists, had, difficulty, in, their, careers, because, of, their, association, with, a, defeated, and, discredited, regime, marinetti, sought, to, make, futurism, the, official, state, art, of, fascist, italy, but, failed, to, do, so, mussolini, chose, to, give, patronage, to, numerous, styles, and, movements, in, order, to, keep, artists, loyal, to, the, regime, opening, the, exhibition, of, art, by, the, novecento, italiano, group, in, 1923, he, said, i, declare, that, it, is, far, from, my, idea, to, encourage, anything, like, a, state, art, art, belongs, to, the, domain, of, the, individual, the, state, has, only, one, duty, not, to, undermine, art, to, provide, humane, conditions, for, artists, to, encourage, them, from, the, artistic, and, national, point, of, view, mussolini, s, mistress, margherita, sarfatti, who, was, as, able, a, cultural, entrepreneur, as, marinetti, successfully, promoted, the, rival, novecento, group, and, even, persuaded, marinetti, to, sit, on, its, board, although, in, the, early, years, of, italian, fascism, modern, art, was, tolerated, and, even, embraced, towards, the, end, of, the, 1930s, right, wing, fascists, introduced, the, concept, of, degenerate, art, from, germany, to, italy, and, condemned, futurism, marinetti, made, numerous, moves, to, ingratiate, himself, with, the, regime, becoming, less, radical, and, avant, garde, with, each, he, moved, from, milan, to, rome, to, be, nearer, the, centre, of, things, he, became, an, academician, despite, his, condemnation, of, academies, married, despite, his, condemnation, of, marriage, promoted, religious, art, after, the, lateran, treaty, of, 1929, and, even, reconciled, himself, to, the, catholic, church, declaring, that, jesus, was, a, futurist, although, futurism, mostly, became, identified, with, fascism, it, had, a, diverse, range, of, supporters, they, tended, to, oppose, marinetti, s, artistic, and, political, direction, of, the, movement, and, in, 1924, the, socialists, communists, and, anarchists, walked, out, of, the, milan, futurist, congress, the, anti, fascist, voices, in, futurism, were, not, completely, silenced, until, the, annexation, of, abyssinia, and, the, italo, german, pact, of, steel, in, 1939, this, association, of, fascists, socialists, and, anarchists, in, the, futurist, movement, which, may, seem, odd, today, can, be, understood, in, terms, of, the, influence, of, georges, sorel, whose, ideas, about, the, regenerative, effect, of, political, violence, had, adherents, right, across, the, political, spectrum, aeropainting, aeropittura, was, a, major, expression, of, the, second, generation, of, futurism, beginning, in, 1926, the, technology, and, excitement, of, flight, directly, experienced, by, most, aeropainters, offered, aeroplanes, and, aerial, landscape, as, new, subject, matter, aeropainting, was, varied, in, subject, matter, and, treatment, including, realism, especially, in, works, of, propaganda, abstraction, dynamism, quiet, umbrian, landscapes, portraits, of, mussolini, e, g, dottori, s, portrait, of, il, duce, devotional, religious, paintings, decorative, art, and, pictures, of, planes, aeropainting, was, launched, in, a, manifesto, of, 1929, perspectives, of, flight, signed, by, cappa, depero, dottori, fill, a, marinetti, prampolini, somenzi, and, tato, guglielmo, sansoni, the, artists, stated, that, the, changing, perspectives, of, flight, constitute, an, absolutely, new, reality, that, has, nothing, in, common, with, the, reality, traditionally, constituted, by, a, terrestrial, perspective, and, that, painting, from, this, new, reality, requires, a, profound, contempt, for, detail, and, a, need, to, synthesise, and, transfigure, everything, crispolti, identifies, three, main, positions, in, aeropainting, a, vision, of, cosmic, projection, at, its, most, typical, in, prampolini, s, cosmic, idealism, a, reverie, of, aerial, fantasies, sometimes, verging, on, fairy, tale, for, example, in, dottori, and, a, kind, of, aeronautical, documentarism, that, comes, dizzyingly, close, to, direct, celebration, of, machinery, particularly, in, crali, but, also, in, tato, and, ambrosi, eventually, there, were, over, a, hundred, aeropainters, major, figures, include, fortunato, depero, marisa, mori, enrico, prampolini, gerardo, dottori, mino, delle, site, and, crali, crali, continued, to, produce, aeropittura, up, until, the, 1980s, futurism, influenced, many, other, twentieth, century, art, movements, including, art, deco, vorticism, constructivism, surrealism, dada, and, much, later, neo, futurism, and, the, grosvenor, school, linocut, artists, futurism, as, a, coherent, and, organized, artistic, movement, is, now, regarded, as, extinct, having, died, out, in, 1944, with, the, death, of, its, leader, marinetti, nonetheless, the, ideals, of, futurism, remain, as, significant, components, of, modern, western, culture, the, emphasis, on, youth, speed, power, and, technology, finding, expression, in, much, of, modern, commercial, cinema, and, culture, ridley, scott, consciously, evoked, the, designs, of, sant, elia, in, blade, runner, echoes, of, marinetti, s, thought, especially, his, dreamt, of, metallization, of, the, human, body, are, still, strongly, prevalent, in, japanese, culture, and, surface, in, manga, anime, and, the, works, of, artists, such, as, shinya, tsukamoto, director, of, the, tetsuo, lit, ironman, films, futurism, has, produced, several, reactions, including, the, literary, genre, of, cyberpunk, in, which, technology, was, often, treated, with, a, critical, eye, whilst, artists, who, came, to, prominence, during, the, first, flush, of, the, internet, such, as, stelarc, and, mariko, mori, produce, work, which, comments, on, futurist, ideals, and, the, art, and, architecture, movement, neo, futurism, in, which, technology, is, considered, a, driver, to, a, better, quality, of, life, and, sustainability, values, a, revival, of, sorts, of, the, futurist, movement, in, theatre, began, in, 1988, with, the, creation, of, the, neo, futurist, style, in, chicago, which, utilizes, futurism, s, focus, on, speed, and, brevity, to, create, a, new, form, of, immediate, theatre, currently, there, are, active, neo, futurist, troupes, in, chicago, new, york, san, francisco, and, montreal, futurist, ideas, have, been, a, major, influence, in, western, popular, music, examples, include, ztt, records, named, after, marinetti, s, poem, zang, tumb, tumb, the, band, art, of, noise, named, after, russolo, s, manifesto, the, art, of, noises, and, the, adam, and, the, ants, single, zerox, the, cover, featuring,
