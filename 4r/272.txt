the, structure, of, scientific, revolutions, is, a, book, about, the, history, of, science, by, the, philosopher, thomas, s, kuhn, its, publication, was, a, landmark, event, in, the, history, philosophy, and, sociology, of, science, kuhn, challenged, the, then, prevailing, view, of, progress, in, science, in, which, scientific, progress, was, viewed, as, development, by, accumulation, of, accepted, facts, and, theories, kuhn, argued, for, an, episodic, model, in, which, periods, of, conceptual, continuity, and, cumulative, progress, referred, to, as, periods, of, normal, science, were, interrupted, by, periods, of, revolutionary, science, the, discovery, of, anomalies, during, revolutions, in, science, leads, to, new, paradigms, new, paradigms, then, ask, new, questions, of, old, data, move, beyond, the, mere, puzzle, solving, of, the, previous, paradigm, alter, the, rules, of, the, game, and, change, the, map, directing, new, research, for, example, kuhn, s, analysis, of, the, copernican, revolution, emphasized, that, in, its, beginning, it, did, not, offer, more, accurate, predictions, of, celestial, events, such, as, planetary, positions, than, the, ptolemaic, system, but, instead, appealed, to, some, practitioners, based, on, a, promise, of, better, simpler, solutions, that, might, be, developed, at, some, point, in, the, future, kuhn, called, the, core, concepts, of, an, ascendant, revolution, its, paradigms, and, thereby, launched, this, word, into, widespread, analogical, use, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, kuhn, s, insistence, that, a, paradigm, shift, was, a, m, lange, of, sociology, enthusiasm, and, scientific, promise, but, not, a, logically, determinate, procedure, caused, an, uproar, in, reaction, to, his, work, kuhn, addressed, concerns, in, the, 1969, postscript, to, the, second, edition, for, some, commentators, the, structure, of, scientific, revolutions, introduced, a, realistic, humanism, into, the, core, of, science, while, for, others, the, nobility, of, science, was, tarnished, by, kuhn, s, introduction, of, an, irrational, element, into, the, heart, of, its, greatest, achievements, the, structure, of, scientific, revolutions, was, first, published, as, a, monograph, in, the, international, encyclopedia, of, unified, science, then, as, a, book, by, university, of, chicago, press, in, 1962, in, 1969, kuhn, added, a, postscript, to, the, book, in, which, he, replied, to, critical, responses, to, the, first, edition, a, 50th, anniversary, edition, with, an, introductory, essay, by, ian, hacking, was, published, by, the, university, of, chicago, press, in, april, 2012, kuhn, dated, the, genesis, of, his, book, to, 1947, when, he, was, a, graduate, student, at, harvard, university, and, had, been, asked, to, teach, a, science, class, for, humanities, undergraduates, with, a, focus, on, historical, case, studies, kuhn, later, commented, that, until, then, i, d, never, read, an, old, document, in, science, aristotle, s, physics, was, astonishingly, unlike, isaac, newton, s, work, in, its, concepts, of, matter, and, motion, kuhn, wrote, as, i, was, reading, him, aristotle, appeared, not, only, ignorant, of, mechanics, but, a, dreadfully, bad, physical, scientist, as, well, about, motion, in, particular, his, writings, seemed, to, me, full, of, egregious, errors, both, of, logic, and, of, observation, this, was, in, an, apparent, contradiction, with, the, fact, that, aristotle, was, a, brilliant, mind, while, perusing, aristotle, s, physics, kuhn, formed, the, view, that, in, order, to, properly, appreciate, aristotle, s, reasoning, one, must, be, aware, of, the, scientific, conventions, of, the, time, kuhn, concluded, that, aristotle, s, concepts, were, not, bad, newton, just, different, this, insight, was, the, foundation, of, the, structure, of, scientific, revolutions, central, ideas, regarding, the, process, of, scientific, investigation, and, discovery, had, been, anticipated, by, ludwik, fleck, in, fleck, 1935, fleck, had, developed, the, first, system, of, the, sociology, of, scientific, knowledge, he, claimed, that, the, exchange, of, ideas, led, to, the, establishment, of, a, thought, collective, which, when, developed, sufficiently, separated, the, field, into, esoteric, professional, and, exoteric, laymen, circles, kuhn, wrote, the, foreword, to, the, 1979, edition, of, fleck, s, book, noting, that, he, read, it, in, 1950, and, was, reassured, that, someone, saw, in, the, history, of, science, what, i, myself, was, finding, there, kuhn, was, not, confident, about, how, his, book, would, be, received, harvard, university, had, denied, his, tenure, a, few, years, prior, by, the, mid, 1980s, however, his, book, had, achieved, blockbuster, status, when, kuhn, s, book, came, out, in, the, early, 1960s, structure, was, an, intellectually, popular, word, in, many, fields, in, the, humanities, and, social, sciences, including, linguistics, and, anthropology, appealing, in, its, idea, that, complex, phenomena, could, reveal, or, be, studied, through, basic, simpler, structures, kuhn, s, book, contributed, to, that, idea, one, theory, to, which, kuhn, replies, directly, is, karl, popper, s, falsificationism, which, stresses, falsifiability, as, the, most, important, criterion, for, distinguishing, between, that, which, is, scientific, and, that, which, is, unscientific, kuhn, also, addresses, verificationism, a, philosophical, movement, that, emerged, in, the, 1920s, among, logical, positivists, the, verifiability, principle, claims, that, meaningful, statements, must, be, supported, by, empirical, evidence, or, logical, requirements, kuhn, s, approach, to, the, history, and, philosophy, of, science, focuses, on, conceptual, issues, like, the, practice, of, normal, science, influence, of, historical, events, emergence, of, scientific, discoveries, nature, of, scientific, revolutions, and, progress, through, scientific, revolutions, what, sorts, of, intellectual, options, and, strategies, were, available, to, people, during, a, given, period, what, types, of, lexicons, and, terminology, were, known, and, employed, during, certain, epochs, stressing, the, importance, of, not, attributing, traditional, thought, to, earlier, investigators, kuhn, s, book, argues, that, the, evolution, of, scientific, theory, does, not, emerge, from, the, straightforward, accumulation, of, facts, but, rather, from, a, set, of, changing, intellectual, circumstances, and, possibilities, kuhn, did, not, see, scientific, theory, as, proceeding, linearly, from, an, objective, unbiased, accumulation, of, all, available, data, but, rather, as, paradigm, driven, the, operations, and, measurements, that, a, scientist, undertakes, in, the, laboratory, are, not, the, given, of, experience, but, rather, the, collected, with, difficulty, they, are, not, what, the, scientist, sees, at, least, not, before, his, research, is, well, advanced, and, his, attention, focused, rather, they, are, concrete, indices, to, the, content, of, more, elementary, perceptions, and, as, such, they, are, selected, for, the, close, scrutiny, of, normal, research, only, because, they, promise, opportunity, for, the, fruitful, elaboration, of, an, accepted, paradigm, far, more, clearly, than, the, immediate, experience, from, which, they, in, part, derive, operations, and, measurements, are, paradigm, determined, science, does, not, deal, in, all, possible, laboratory, manipulations, instead, it, selects, those, relevant, to, the, juxtaposition, of, a, paradigm, with, the, immediate, experience, that, that, paradigm, has, partially, determined, as, a, result, scientists, with, different, paradigms, engage, in, different, concrete, laboratory, manipulations, kuhn, explains, his, ideas, using, examples, taken, from, the, history, of, science, for, instance, eighteenth, century, scientists, believed, that, homogenous, solutions, were, chemical, compounds, therefore, a, combination, of, water, and, alcohol, was, generally, classified, as, a, compound, nowadays, it, is, considered, to, be, a, solution, but, there, was, no, reason, then, to, suspect, that, it, was, not, a, compound, water, and, alcohol, would, not, separate, spontaneously, nor, will, they, separate, completely, upon, distillation, they, form, an, azeotrope, water, and, alcohol, can, be, combined, in, any, proportion, under, this, paradigm, scientists, believed, that, chemical, reactions, such, as, the, combination, of, water, and, alcohol, did, not, necessarily, occur, in, fixed, proportion, this, belief, was, ultimately, overturned, by, dalton, s, atomic, theory, which, asserted, that, atoms, can, only, combine, in, simple, whole, number, ratios, under, this, new, paradigm, any, reaction, which, did, not, occur, in, fixed, proportion, could, not, be, a, chemical, process, this, type, of, world, view, transition, among, the, scientific, community, exemplifies, kuhn, s, paradigm, shift, a, famous, example, of, a, revolution, in, scientific, thought, is, the, copernican, revolution, in, ptolemy, s, school, of, thought, cycles, and, epicycles, with, some, additional, concepts, were, used, for, modeling, the, movements, of, the, planets, in, a, cosmos, that, had, a, stationary, earth, at, its, center, as, accuracy, of, celestial, observations, increased, complexity, of, the, ptolemaic, cyclical, and, epicyclical, mechanisms, had, to, increase, to, maintain, the, calculated, planetary, positions, close, to, the, observed, positions, copernicus, proposed, a, cosmology, in, which, the, sun, was, at, the, center, and, the, earth, was, one, of, the, planets, revolving, around, it, for, modeling, the, planetary, motions, copernicus, used, the, tools, he, was, familiar, with, namely, the, cycles, and, epicycles, of, the, ptolemaic, toolbox, yet, copernicus, model, needed, more, cycles, and, epicycles, than, existed, in, the, then, current, ptolemaic, model, and, due, to, a, lack, of, accuracy, in, calculations, his, model, did, not, appear, to, provide, more, accurate, predictions, than, the, ptolemy, model, copernicus, contemporaries, rejected, his, cosmology, and, kuhn, asserts, that, they, were, quite, right, to, do, so, copernicus, cosmology, lacked, credibility, kuhn, illustrates, how, a, paradigm, shift, later, became, possible, when, galileo, galilei, introduced, his, new, ideas, concerning, motion, intuitively, when, an, object, is, set, in, motion, it, soon, comes, to, a, halt, a, well, made, cart, may, travel, a, long, distance, before, it, stops, but, unless, something, keeps, pushing, it, it, will, eventually, stop, moving, aristotle, had, argued, that, this, was, presumably, a, fundamental, property, of, nature, for, the, motion, of, an, object, to, be, sustained, it, must, continue, to, be, pushed, given, the, knowledge, available, at, the, time, this, represented, sensible, reasonable, thinking, galileo, put, forward, a, bold, alternative, conjecture, suppose, he, said, that, we, always, observe, objects, coming, to, a, halt, simply, because, some, friction, is, always, occurring, galileo, had, no, equipment, with, which, to, objectively, confirm, his, conjecture, but, he, suggested, that, without, any, friction, to, slow, down, an, object, in, motion, its, inherent, tendency, is, to, maintain, its, speed, without, the, application, of, any, additional, force, the, ptolemaic, approach, of, using, cycles, and, epicycles, was, becoming, strained, there, seemed, to, be, no, end, to, the, mushrooming, growth, in, complexity, required, to, account, for, the, observable, phenomena, johannes, kepler, was, the, first, person, to, abandon, the, tools, of, the, ptolemaic, paradigm, he, started, to, explore, the, possibility, that, the, planet, mars, might, have, an, elliptical, orbit, rather, than, a, circular, one, clearly, the, angular, velocity, could, not, be, constant, but, it, proved, very, difficult, to, find, the, formula, describing, the, rate, of, change, of, the, planet, s, angular, velocity, after, many, years, of, calculations, kepler, arrived, at, what, we, now, know, as, the, law, of, equal, areas, galileo, s, conjecture, was, merely, that, a, conjecture, so, was, kepler, s, cosmology, but, each, conjecture, increased, the, credibility, of, the, other, and, together, they, changed, the, prevailing, perceptions, of, the, scientific, community, later, newton, showed, that, kepler, s, three, laws, could, all, be, derived, from, a, single, theory, of, motion, and, planetary, motion, newton, solidified, and, unified, the, paradigm, shift, that, galileo, and, kepler, had, initiated, one, of, the, aims, of, science, is, to, find, models, that, will, account, for, as, many, observations, as, possible, within, a, coherent, framework, together, galileo, s, rethinking, of, the, nature, of, motion, and, keplerian, cosmology, represented, a, coherent, framework, that, was, capable, of, rivaling, the, aristotelian, ptolemaic, framework, once, a, paradigm, shift, has, taken, place, the, textbooks, are, rewritten, often, the, history, of, science, too, is, rewritten, being, presented, as, an, inevitable, process, leading, up, to, the, current, established, framework, of, thought, there, is, a, prevalent, belief, that, all, hitherto, unexplained, phenomena, will, in, due, course, be, accounted, for, in, terms, of, this, established, framework, kuhn, states, that, scientists, spend, most, if, not, all, of, their, careers, in, a, process, of, puzzle, solving, their, puzzle, solving, is, pursued, with, great, tenacity, because, the, previous, successes, of, the, established, paradigm, tend, to, generate, great, confidence, that, the, approach, being, taken, guarantees, that, a, solution, to, the, puzzle, exists, even, though, it, may, be, very, hard, to, find, kuhn, calls, this, process, normal, science, as, a, paradigm, is, stretched, to, its, limits, anomalies, failures, of, the, current, paradigm, to, take, into, account, observed, phenomena, accumulate, their, significance, is, judged, by, the, practitioners, of, the, discipline, some, anomalies, may, be, dismissed, as, errors, in, observation, others, as, merely, requiring, small, adjustments, to, the, current, paradigm, that, will, be, clarified, in, due, course, some, anomalies, resolve, themselves, spontaneously, having, increased, the, available, depth, of, insight, along, the, way, but, no, matter, how, great, or, numerous, the, anomalies, that, persist, kuhn, observes, the, practicing, scientists, will, not, lose, faith, in, the, established, paradigm, until, a, credible, alternative, is, available, to, lose, faith, in, the, solvability, of, the, problems, would, in, effect, mean, ceasing, to, be, a, scientist, in, any, community, of, scientists, kuhn, states, there, are, some, individuals, who, are, bolder, than, most, these, scientists, judging, that, a, crisis, exists, embark, on, what, kuhn, calls, revolutionary, science, exploring, alternatives, to, long, held, obvious, seeming, assumptions, occasionally, this, generates, a, rival, to, the, established, framework, of, thought, the, new, candidate, paradigm, will, appear, to, be, accompanied, by, numerous, anomalies, partly, because, it, is, still, so, new, and, incomplete, the, majority, of, the, scientific, community, will, oppose, any, conceptual, change, and, kuhn, emphasizes, so, they, should, to, fulfill, its, potential, a, scientific, community, needs, to, contain, both, individuals, who, are, bold, and, individuals, who, are, conservative, there, are, many, examples, in, the, history, of, science, in, which, confidence, in, the, established, frame, of, thought, was, eventually, vindicated, kuhn, cites, as, an, example, that, alexis, clairaut, in, 1750, was, able, to, account, accurately, for, the, precession, of, the, moon, s, orbit, using, newtonian, theory, after, sixty, years, of, failed, attempts, it, is, almost, impossible, to, predict, whether, the, anomalies, in, a, candidate, for, a, new, paradigm, will, eventually, be, resolved, those, scientists, who, possess, an, exceptional, ability, to, recognize, a, theory, s, potential, will, be, the, first, whose, preference, is, likely, to, shift, in, favour, of, the, challenging, paradigm, there, typically, follows, a, period, in, which, there, are, adherents, of, both, paradigms, in, time, if, the, challenging, paradigm, is, solidified, and, unified, it, will, replace, the, old, paradigm, and, a, paradigm, shift, will, have, occurred, kuhn, explains, the, process, of, scientific, change, as, the, result, of, various, phases, of, paradigm, change, a, science, may, go, through, these, cycles, repeatedly, though, kuhn, notes, that, it, is, a, good, thing, for, science, that, such, shifts, do, not, occur, often, or, easily, according, to, kuhn, the, scientific, paradigms, preceding, and, succeeding, a, paradigm, shift, are, so, different, that, their, theories, are, incommensurable, the, new, paradigm, cannot, be, proven, or, disproven, by, the, rules, of, the, old, paradigm, and, vice, versa, a, later, interpretation, by, kuhn, of, commensurable, versus, incommensurable, was, as, a, distinction, between, languages, namely, that, statements, in, commensurable, languages, were, translatable, fully, from, one, to, the, other, while, in, in, commensurable, languages, strict, translation, is, not, possible, the, paradigm, shift, does, not, merely, involve, the, revision, or, transformation, of, an, individual, theory, it, changes, the, way, terminology, is, defined, how, the, scientists, in, that, field, view, their, subject, and, perhaps, most, significantly, what, questions, are, regarded, as, valid, and, what, rules, are, used, to, determine, the, truth, of, a, particular, theory, the, new, theories, were, not, as, the, scientists, had, previously, thought, just, extensions, of, old, theories, but, were, instead, completely, new, world, views, such, incommensurability, exists, not, just, before, and, after, a, paradigm, shift, but, in, the, periods, in, between, conflicting, paradigms, it, is, simply, not, possible, according, to, kuhn, to, construct, an, impartial, language, that, can, be, used, to, perform, a, neutral, comparison, between, conflicting, paradigms, because, the, very, terms, used, are, integral, to, the, respective, paradigms, and, therefore, have, different, connotations, in, each, paradigm, the, advocates, of, mutually, exclusive, paradigms, are, in, a, difficult, position, though, each, may, hope, to, convert, the, other, to, his, way, of, seeing, science, and, its, problems, neither, may, hope, to, prove, his, case, the, competition, between, paradigms, is, not, the, sort, of, battle, that, can, be, resolved, by, proofs, scientists, subscribing, to, different, paradigms, end, up, talking, past, one, another, kuhn, states, that, the, probabilistic, tools, used, by, verificationists, are, inherently, inadequate, for, the, task, of, deciding, between, conflicting, theories, since, they, belong, to, the, very, paradigms, they, seek, to, compare, similarly, observations, that, are, intended, to, falsify, a, statement, will, fall, under, one, of, the, paradigms, they, are, supposed, to, help, compare, and, will, therefore, also, be, inadequate, for, the, task, according, to, kuhn, the, concept, of, falsifiability, is, unhelpful, for, understanding, why, and, how, science, has, developed, as, it, has, in, the, practice, of, science, scientists, will, only, consider, the, possibility, that, a, theory, has, been, falsified, if, an, alternative, theory, is, available, that, they, judge, credible, if, there, is, not, scientists, will, continue, to, adhere, to, the, established, conceptual, framework, if, a, paradigm, shift, has, occurred, the, textbooks, will, be, rewritten, to, state, that, the, previous, theory, has, been, falsified, kuhn, further, developed, his, ideas, regarding, incommensurability, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, in, his, unpublished, manuscript, the, plurality, of, worlds, kuhn, introduces, the, theory, of, kind, concepts, sets, of, interrelated, concepts, that, are, characteristic, of, a, time, period, in, a, science, and, differ, in, structure, from, the, modern, analogous, kind, concepts, these, different, structures, imply, different, taxonomies, of, things, and, processes, and, this, difference, in, taxonomies, constitutes, incommensurability, this, theory, is, strongly, naturalistic, and, draws, on, developmental, psychology, to, found, a, quasi, transcendental, theory, of, experience, and, of, reality, kuhn, introduced, the, concept, of, an, exemplar, in, a, postscript, to, the, second, edition, of, the, structure, of, scientific, revolutions, 1970, he, noted, that, he, was, substituting, the, term, exemplars, for, paradigm, meaning, the, problems, and, solutions, that, students, of, a, subject, learn, from, the, beginning, of, their, education, for, example, physicists, might, have, as, exemplars, the, inclined, plane, kepler, s, laws, of, planetary, motion, or, instruments, like, the, calorimeter, according, to, kuhn, scientific, practice, alternates, between, periods, of, normal, science, and, revolutionary, science, during, periods, of, normalcy, scientists, tend, to, subscribe, to, a, large, body, of, interconnecting, knowledge, methods, and, assumptions, which, make, up, the, reigning, paradigm, see, paradigm, shift, normal, science, presents, a, series, of, problems, that, are, solved, as, scientists, explore, their, field, the, solutions, to, some, of, these, problems, become, well, known, and, are, the, exemplars, of, the, field, those, who, study, a, scientific, discipline, are, expected, to, know, its, exemplars, there, is, no, fixed, set, of, exemplars, but, for, a, physicist, today, it, would, probably, include, the, harmonic, oscillator, from, mechanics, and, the, hydrogen, atom, from, quantum, mechanics, the, first, edition, of, the, structure, of, scientific, revolutions, ended, with, a, chapter, titled, progress, through, revolutions, in, which, kuhn, spelled, out, his, views, on, the, nature, of, scientific, progress, since, he, considered, problem, solving, or, puzzle, solving, to, be, a, central, element, of, science, kuhn, saw, that, for, a, new, candidate, paradigm, to, be, accepted, by, a, scientific, community, first, the, new, candidate, must, seem, to, resolve, some, outstanding, and, generally, recognized, problem, that, can, be, met, in, no, other, way, second, the, new, paradigm, must, promise, to, preserve, a, relatively, large, part, of, the, concrete, problem, solving, ability, that, has, accrued, to, science, through, its, predecessors, novelty, for, its, own, sake, is, not, a, desideratum, in, the, sciences, as, it, is, in, so, many, other, creative, fields, as, a, result, though, new, paradigms, seldom, or, never, possess, all, the, capabilities, of, their, predecessors, they, usually, preserve, a, great, deal, of, the, most, concrete, parts, of, past, achievement, and, they, always, permit, additional, concrete, problem, solutions, besides, in, the, second, edition, kuhn, added, a, postscript, in, which, he, elaborated, his, ideas, on, the, nature, of, scientific, progress, he, described, a, thought, experiment, involving, an, observer, who, has, the, opportunity, to, inspect, an, assortment, of, theories, each, corresponding, to, a, single, stage, in, a, succession, of, theories, what, if, the, observer, is, presented, with, these, theories, without, any, explicit, indication, of, their, chronological, order, kuhn, anticipates, that, it, will, be, possible, to, reconstruct, their, chronology, on, the, basis, of, the, theories, scope, and, content, because, the, more, recent, a, theory, is, the, better, it, will, be, as, an, instrument, for, solving, the, kinds, of, puzzle, that, scientists, aim, to, solve, kuhn, remarked, that, is, not, a, relativist, s, position, and, it, displays, the, sense, in, which, i, am, a, convinced, believer, in, scientific, progress, the, structure, of, scientific, revolutions, has, been, credited, with, producing, the, kind, of, paradigm, shift, kuhn, discussed, since, the, book, s, publication, over, one, million, copies, have, been, sold, including, translations, into, sixteen, different, languages, in, 1987, it, was, reported, to, be, the, twentieth, century, book, most, frequently, cited, in, the, period, 1976, 1983, in, the, arts, and, the, humanities, the, first, extensive, review, of, the, structure, of, scientific, revolutions, was, authored, by, dudley, shapere, a, philosopher, who, interpreted, kuhn, s, work, as, a, continuation, of, the, anti, positivist, sentiment, of, other, philosophers, of, science, including, paul, feyerabend, and, norwood, russell, hanson, shapere, noted, the, book, s, influence, on, the, philosophical, landscape, of, the, time, calling, it, a, sustained, attack, on, the, prevailing, image, of, scientific, change, as, a, linear, process, of, ever, increasing, knowledge, according, to, the, philosopher, michael, ruse, kuhn, discredited, the, ahistorical, and, prescriptive, approach, to, the, philosophy, of, science, of, ernest, nagel, s, the, structure, of, science, 1961, kuhn, s, book, sparked, a, historicist, revolt, against, positivism, the, so, called, historical, turn, in, philosophy, of, science, which, looked, to, the, history, of, science, as, a, source, of, data, for, developing, a, philosophy, of, science, although, this, may, not, have, been, kuhn, s, intention, in, fact, he, had, already, approached, the, prominent, positivist, rudolf, carnap, about, having, his, work, published, in, the, international, encyclopedia, of, unified, science, the, philosopher, robert, c, solomon, noted, that, kuhn, s, views, have, often, been, suggested, to, have, an, affinity, to, those, of, georg, wilhelm, friedrich, hegel, kuhn, s, view, of, scientific, knowledge, as, expounded, in, the, structure, of, scientific, revolutions, has, been, compared, to, the, views, of, the, philosopher, michel, foucault, the, first, field, to, claim, descent, from, kuhn, s, ideas, was, the, sociology, of, scientific, knowledge, sociologists, working, within, this, new, field, including, harry, collins, and, steven, shapin, used, kuhn, s, emphasis, on, the, role, of, non, evidential, community, factors, in, scientific, development, to, argue, against, logical, empiricism, which, discouraged, inquiry, into, the, social, aspects, of, scientific, communities, these, sociologists, expanded, upon, kuhn, s, ideas, arguing, that, scientific, judgment, is, determined, by, social, factors, such, as, professional, interests, and, political, ideologies, barry, barnes, detailed, the, connection, between, the, sociology, of, scientific, knowledge, and, kuhn, in, his, book, t, s, kuhn, and, social, science, in, particular, kuhn, s, ideas, regarding, science, occurring, within, an, established, framework, informed, barnes, s, own, ideas, regarding, finitism, a, theory, wherein, meaning, is, continuously, changed, even, during, periods, of, normal, science, by, its, usage, within, the, social, framework, the, structure, of, scientific, revolutions, elicited, a, number, of, reactions, from, the, broader, sociological, community, following, the, book, s, publication, some, sociologists, expressed, the, belief, that, the, field, of, sociology, had, not, yet, developed, a, unifying, paradigm, and, should, therefore, strive, towards, homogenization, others, argued, that, the, field, was, in, the, midst, of, normal, science, and, speculated, that, a, new, revolution, would, soon, emerge, some, sociologists, including, john, urry, doubted, that, kuhn, s, theory, which, addressed, the, development, of, natural, science, was, necessarily, relevant, to, sociological, development, developments, in, the, field, of, economics, are, often, expressed, and, legitimized, in, kuhnian, terms, for, instance, neoclassical, economists, have, claimed, to, be, at, the, second, stage, and, to, have, been, there, for, a, very, long, time, since, adam, smith, according, to, some, accounts, hollander, 1987, or, jevons, according, to, others, hutchison, 1978, in, the, 1970s, post, keynesian, economists, denied, the, coherence, of, the, neoclassical, paradigm, claiming, that, their, own, paradigm, would, ultimately, become, dominant, while, perhaps, less, explicit, kuhn, s, influence, remains, apparent, in, recent, economics, for, instance, the, abstract, of, olivier, blanchard, s, paper, the, state, of, macro, 2008, begins, for, a, long, while, after, the, explosion, of, macroeconomics, in, the, 1970s, the, field, looked, like, a, battlefield, over, time, however, largely, because, facts, do, not, go, away, a, largely, shared, vision, both, of, fluctuations, and, of, methodology, has, emerged, not, everything, is, fine, like, all, revolutions, this, one, has, come, with, the, destruction, of, some, knowledge, and, suffers, from, extremism, and, herding, in, 1974, the, structure, of, scientific, revolutions, was, ranked, as, the, second, most, frequently, used, book, in, political, science, courses, focused, on, scope, and, methods, in, particular, kuhn, s, theory, has, been, used, by, political, scientists, to, critique, behavioralism, which, claims, that, accurate, political, statements, must, be, both, testable, and, falsifiable, the, book, also, proved, popular, with, political, scientists, embroiled, in, debates, about, whether, a, set, of, formulations, put, forth, by, a, political, scientist, constituted, a, theory, or, something, else, the, changes, that, occur, in, politics, society, and, business, are, often, expressed, in, kuhnian, terms, however, poor, their, parallel, with, the, practice, of, science, may, seem, to, scientists, and, historians, of, science, the, terms, paradigm, and, paradigm, shift, have, become, such, notorious, clich, s, and, buzzwords, that, they, are, sometimes, viewed, as, effectively, devoid, of, content, the, structure, of, scientific, revolutions, was, soon, criticized, by, kuhn, s, colleagues, in, the, history, and, philosophy, of, science, in, 1965, a, special, symposium, on, the, book, was, held, at, an, international, colloquium, on, the, philosophy, of, science, that, took, place, at, bedford, college, london, and, was, chaired, by, karl, popper, the, symposium, led, to, the, publication, of, the, symposium, s, presentations, plus, other, essays, most, of, them, critical, which, eventually, appeared, in, an, influential, volume, of, essays, kuhn, expressed, the, opinion, that, his, critics, readings, of, his, book, were, so, inconsistent, with, his, own, understanding, of, it, that, he, was, tempted, to, posit, the, existence, of, two, thomas, kuhns, one, the, author, of, his, book, the, other, the, individual, who, had, been, criticized, in, the, symposium, by, professors, popper, feyerabend, lakatos, toulmin, and, watkins, a, number, of, the, included, essays, question, the, existence, of, normal, science, in, his, essay, feyerabend, suggests, that, kuhn, s, conception, of, normal, science, fits, organized, crime, as, well, as, it, does, science, popper, expresses, distaste, with, the, entire, premise, of, kuhn, s, book, writing, the, idea, of, turning, for, enlightenment, concerning, the, aims, of, science, and, its, possible, progress, to, sociology, or, to, psychology, or, to, the, history, of, science, is, surprising, and, disappointing, stephen, toulmin, defined, paradigm, as, the, set, of, common, beliefs, and, agreements, shared, between, scientists, about, how, problems, should, be, understood, and, addressed, in, his, 1972, work, human, understanding, he, argued, that, a, more, realistic, picture, of, science, than, that, presented, in, the, structure, of, scientific, revolutions, would, admit, the, fact, that, revisions, in, science, take, place, much, more, frequently, and, are, much, less, dramatic, than, can, be, explained, by, the, model, of, revolution, normal, science, in, toulmin, s, view, such, revisions, occur, quite, often, during, periods, of, what, kuhn, would, call, normal, science, for, kuhn, to, explain, such, revisions, in, terms, of, the, non, paradigmatic, puzzle, solutions, of, normal, science, he, would, need, to, delineate, what, is, perhaps, an, implausibly, sharp, distinction, between, paradigmatic, and, non, paradigmatic, science, in, a, series, of, texts, published, in, the, early, 1970s, carl, r, kordig, asserted, a, position, somewhere, between, that, of, kuhn, and, the, older, philosophy, of, science, his, criticism, of, the, kuhnian, position, was, that, the, incommensurability, thesis, was, too, radical, and, that, this, made, it, impossible, to, explain, the, confrontation, of, scientific, theories, that, actually, occurs, according, to, kordig, it, is, in, fact, possible, to, admit, the, existence, of, revolutions, and, paradigm, shifts, in, science, while, still, recognizing, that, theories, belonging, to, different, paradigms, can, be, compared, and, confronted, on, the, plane, of, observation, those, who, accept, the, incommensurability, thesis, do, not, do, so, because, they, admit, the, discontinuity, of, paradigms, but, because, they, attribute, a, radical, change, in, meanings, to, such, shifts, kordig, maintains, that, there, is, a, common, observational, plane, for, example, when, kepler, and, tycho, brahe, are, trying, to, explain, the, relative, variation, of, the, distance, of, the, sun, from, the, horizon, at, sunrise, both, see, the, same, thing, the, same, configuration, is, focused, on, the, retina, of, each, individual, this, is, just, one, example, of, the, fact, that, rival, scientific, theories, share, some, observations, and, therefore, some, meanings, kordig, suggests, that, with, this, approach, he, is, not, reintroducing, the, distinction, between, observations, and, theory, in, which, the, former, is, assigned, a, privileged, and, neutral, status, but, that, it, is, possible, to, affirm, more, simply, the, fact, that, even, if, no, sharp, distinction, exists, between, theory, and, observations, this, does, not, imply, that, there, are, no, comprehensible, differences, at, the, two, extremes, of, this, polarity, at, a, secondary, level, for, kordig, there, is, a, common, plane, of, inter, paradigmatic, standards, or, shared, norms, that, permit, the, effective, confrontation, of, rival, theories, in, 1973, hartry, field, published, an, article, that, also, sharply, criticized, kuhn, s, idea, of, incommensurability, in, particular, he, took, issue, with, this, passage, from, kuhn, newtonian, mass, is, immutably, conserved, that, of, einstein, is, convertible, into, energy, only, at, very, low, relative, velocities, can, the, two, masses, be, measured, in, the, same, way, and, even, then, they, must, not, be, conceived, as, if, they, were, the, same, thing, field, takes, this, idea, of, incommensurability, between, the, same, terms, in, different, theories, one, step, further, instead, of, attempting, to, identify, a, persistence, of, the, reference, of, terms, in, different, theories, field, s, analysis, emphasizes, the, indeterminacy, of, reference, within, individual, theories, field, takes, the, example, of, the, term, mass, and, asks, what, exactly, mass, means, in, modern, post, relativistic, physics, he, finds, that, there, are, at, least, two, different, definitions, projecting, this, distinction, backwards, in, time, onto, newtonian, dynamics, we, can, formulate, the, following, two, hypotheses, according, to, field, it, is, impossible, to, decide, which, of, these, two, affirmations, is, true, prior, to, the, theory, of, relativity, the, term, mass, was, referentially, indeterminate, but, this, does, not, mean, that, the, term, mass, did, not, have, a, different, meaning, than, it, now, has, the, problem, is, not, one, of, meaning, but, of, reference, the, reference, of, such, terms, as, mass, is, only, partially, determined, we, do, not, really, know, how, newton, intended, his, use, of, this, term, to, be, applied, as, a, consequence, neither, of, the, two, terms, fully, denotes, refers, it, follows, that, it, is, improper, to, maintain, that, a, term, has, changed, its, reference, during, a, scientific, revolution, it, is, more, appropriate, to, describe, terms, such, as, mass, as, having, undergone, a, denotional, refinement, in, 1974, donald, davidson, objected, that, the, concept, of, incommensurable, scientific, paradigms, competing, with, each, other, is, logically, inconsistent, in, his, article, davidson, goes, well, beyond, the, semantic, version, of, the, incommensurability, thesis, to, make, sense, of, the, idea, of, a, language, independent, of, translation, requires, a, distinction, between, conceptual, schemes, and, the, content, organized, by, such, schemes, but, davidson, argues, no, coherent, sense, can, be, made, of, the, idea, of, a, conceptual, scheme, and, therefore, no, sense, may, be, attached, to, the, idea, of, an, untranslatable, language, the, close, connection, between, the, interpretationalist, hypothesis, and, a, holistic, conception, of, beliefs, is, at, the, root, of, the, notion, of, the, dependence, of, perception, on, theory, a, central, concept, in, the, structure, of, scientific, revolutions, kuhn, maintained, that, the, perception, of, the, world, depends, on, how, the, percipient, conceives, the, world, two, scientists, who, witness, the, same, phenomenon, and, are, steeped, in, two, radically, different, theories, will, see, two, different, things, according, to, this, view, our, interpretation, of, the, world, determines, what, we, see, jerry, fodor, attempts, to, establish, that, this, theoretical, paradigm, is, fallacious, and, misleading, by, demonstrating, the, impenetrability, of, perception, to, the, background, knowledge, of, subjects, the, strongest, case, can, be, based, on, evidence, from, experimental, cognitive, psychology, namely, the, persistence, of, perceptual, illusions, knowing, that, the, lines, in, the, m, ller, lyer, illusion, are, equal, does, not, prevent, one, from, continuing, to, see, one, line, as, being, longer, than, the, other, this, impenetrability, of, the, information, elaborated, by, the, mental, modules, limits, the, scope, of, interpretationalism, in, epistemology, for, example, the, criticism, of, what, fodor, calls, the, interpretationalist, hypothesis, accounts, for, the, common, sense, intuition, on, which, na, ve, physics, is, based, of, the, independence, of, reality, from, the, conceptual, categories, of, the, experimenter, if, the, processes, of, elaboration, of, the, mental, modules, are, in, fact, independent, of, the, background, theories, then, it, is, possible, to, maintain, the, realist, view, that, two, scientists, who, embrace, two, radically, diverse, theories, see, the, world, exactly, in, the, same, manner, even, if, they, interpret, it, differently, the, point, is, that, it, is, necessary, to, distinguish, between, observations, and, the, perceptual, fixation, of, beliefs, while, it, is, beyond, doubt, that, the, second, process, involves, the, holistic, relationship, between, beliefs, the, first, is, largely, independent, of, the, background, beliefs, of, individuals, other, critics, such, as, israel, scheffler, hilary, putnam, and, saul, kripke, have, focused, on, the, fregean, distinction, between, sense, and, reference, in, order, to, defend, scientific, realism, scheffler, contends, that, kuhn, confuses, the, meanings, of, terms, such, as, mass, with, their, referents, while, their, meanings, may, very, well, differ, their, referents, the, objects, or, entities, to, which, they, correspond, in, the, external, world, remain, fixed, in, 1995, kuhn, argued, that, the, darwinian, metaphor, in, the, book, should, have, been, taken, more, seriously, than, it, had, been
