the, metamorphoses, latin, metamorph, s, s, from, ancient, greek, transformations, is, a, latin, narrative, poem, from, 8, ce, by, the, roman, poet, ovid, it, is, considered, his, magnum, opus, the, poem, chronicles, the, history, of, the, world, from, its, creation, to, the, deification, of, julius, caesar, in, a, mythico, historical, framework, comprising, over, 250, myths, 15, books, and, 11, 995, lines, although, it, meets, some, of, the, criteria, for, an, epic, the, poem, defies, simple, genre, classification, because, of, its, varying, themes, and, tones, ovid, took, inspiration, from, the, genre, of, metamorphosis, poetry, although, some, of, the, metamorphoses, derives, from, earlier, treatment, of, the, same, myths, ovid, diverged, significantly, from, all, of, his, models, the, metamorphoses, is, one, of, the, most, influential, works, in, western, culture, it, has, inspired, such, authors, as, dante, alighieri, giovanni, boccaccio, geoffrey, chaucer, and, william, shakespeare, numerous, episodes, from, the, poem, have, been, depicted, in, works, of, sculpture, painting, and, music, especially, during, the, renaissance, there, was, a, resurgence, of, attention, to, ovid, s, work, near, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, the, metamorphoses, continues, to, inspire, and, be, retold, through, various, media, numerous, english, translations, of, the, work, have, been, made, the, first, by, william, caxton, in, 1480, ovid, s, relation, to, the, hellenistic, poets, was, similar, to, the, attitude, of, the, hellenistic, poets, themselves, to, their, predecessors, he, demonstrated, that, he, had, read, their, versions, but, that, he, could, still, treat, the, myths, in, his, own, way, karl, galinsky, ovid, s, decision, to, make, myth, the, primary, subject, of, the, metamorphoses, was, influenced, by, alexandrian, poetry, in, that, tradition, myth, functioned, as, a, vehicle, for, moral, reflection, or, insight, yet, ovid, approached, it, as, an, object, of, play, and, artful, manipulation, the, model, for, a, collection, of, metamorphosis, myths, was, found, in, the, metamorphosis, poetry, of, the, hellenistic, tradition, which, is, first, represented, by, boios, ornithogonia, a, now, fragmentary, poem, of, collected, myths, about, the, metamorphoses, of, humans, into, birds, there, are, three, examples, of, metamorphoses, by, later, hellenistic, writers, but, little, is, known, of, their, contents, the, heteroioumena, by, nicander, of, colophon, is, better, known, and, clearly, an, influence, on, the, poem, 21, of, the, stories, from, this, work, are, treated, in, the, metamorphoses, however, in, a, way, that, was, typical, for, writers, of, the, period, ovid, diverged, significantly, from, his, models, the, metamorphoses, was, longer, than, any, previous, collection, of, metamorphosis, myths, nicander, s, work, consisted, of, probably, four, or, five, books, and, positioned, itself, within, a, historical, framework, some, of, the, metamorphoses, derives, from, earlier, literary, and, poetic, treatment, of, the, same, myths, this, material, was, of, varying, quality, and, comprehensiveness, while, some, of, it, was, finely, worked, in, other, cases, ovid, may, have, been, working, from, limited, material, in, the, case, of, an, oft, used, myth, such, as, that, of, io, in, book, i, which, was, the, subject, of, literary, adaptation, as, early, as, the, 5th, century, bce, and, as, recently, as, a, generation, prior, to, his, own, ovid, reorganises, and, innovates, existing, material, in, order, to, foreground, his, favoured, topics, and, to, embody, the, key, themes, of, the, metamorphoses, scholars, have, found, it, difficult, to, place, the, metamorphoses, in, a, genre, the, poem, has, been, considered, as, an, epic, or, a, type, of, epic, for, example, an, anti, epic, or, mock, epic, a, kollektivgedicht, that, pulls, together, a, series, of, examples, in, miniature, form, such, as, the, epyllion, a, sampling, of, one, genre, after, another, or, simply, a, narrative, that, refuses, categorization, the, poem, is, generally, considered, to, meet, the, criteria, for, an, epic, it, is, considerably, long, relating, over, 250, narratives, across, fifteen, books, it, is, composed, in, dactylic, hexameter, the, meter, of, both, the, ancient, iliad, and, odyssey, and, the, more, contemporary, epic, aeneid, and, it, treats, the, high, literary, subject, of, myth, however, the, poem, handles, the, themes, and, employs, the, tone, of, virtually, every, species, of, literature, ranging, from, epic, and, elegy, to, tragedy, and, pastoral, commenting, on, the, genre, debate, karl, galinsky, has, opined, that, it, would, be, misguided, to, pin, the, label, of, any, genre, on, the, metamorphoses, the, metamorphoses, is, comprehensive, in, its, chronology, recounting, the, creation, of, the, world, to, the, death, of, julius, caesar, which, had, occurred, only, a, year, before, ovid, s, birth, it, has, been, compared, to, works, of, universal, history, which, became, important, in, the, 1st, century, bce, in, spite, of, its, apparently, unbroken, chronology, scholar, brooks, otis, has, identified, four, divisions, in, the, narrative, ovid, works, his, way, through, his, subject, matter, often, in, an, apparently, arbitrary, fashion, by, jumping, from, one, transformation, tale, to, another, sometimes, retelling, what, had, come, to, be, seen, as, central, events, in, the, world, of, greek, mythology, and, sometimes, straying, in, odd, directions, it, begins, with, the, ritual, invocation, of, the, muse, and, makes, use, of, traditional, epithets, and, circumlocutions, but, instead, of, following, and, extolling, the, deeds, of, a, human, hero, it, leaps, from, story, to, story, with, little, connection, the, recurring, theme, as, with, nearly, all, of, ovid, s, work, is, love, be, it, personal, love, or, love, personified, in, the, figure, of, amor, cupid, indeed, the, other, roman, gods, are, repeatedly, perplexed, humiliated, and, made, ridiculous, by, amor, an, otherwise, relatively, minor, god, of, the, pantheon, who, is, the, closest, thing, this, putative, mock, epic, has, to, a, hero, apollo, comes, in, for, particular, ridicule, as, ovid, shows, how, irrational, love, can, confound, the, god, out, of, reason, the, work, as, a, whole, inverts, the, accepted, order, elevating, humans, and, human, passions, while, making, the, gods, and, their, desires, and, conquests, objects, of, low, humor, the, metamorphoses, ends, with, an, epilogue, book, xv, 871, 879, one, of, only, two, surviving, latin, epics, to, do, so, the, other, being, statius, thebaid, the, ending, acts, as, a, declaration, that, everything, except, his, poetry, even, rome, must, give, way, to, change, and, now, my, work, is, done, which, neither, jove, nor, flame, nor, sword, nor, gnawing, time, can, fade, that, day, which, governs, only, my, poor, frame, may, come, at, will, to, end, my, unfixed, life, but, in, my, better, and, immortal, part, i, shall, be, borne, beyond, the, lofty, stars, and, never, will, my, name, be, washed, away, where, roman, power, prevails, i, shall, be, read, and, so, in, fame, and, on, through, every, age, if, bards, foretell, the, truth, at, all, i, ll, live, the, different, genres, and, divisions, in, the, narrative, allow, the, metamorphoses, to, display, a, wide, range, of, themes, scholar, stephen, m, wheeler, notes, that, metamorphosis, mutability, love, violence, artistry, and, power, are, just, some, of, the, unifying, themes, that, critics, have, proposed, over, the, years, in, nova, fert, animus, mutatas, dicere, formas, corpora, metamorphosis, or, transformation, is, a, unifying, theme, amongst, the, episodes, of, the, metamorphoses, ovid, raises, its, significance, explicitly, in, the, opening, lines, of, the, poem, in, nova, fert, animus, mutatas, dicere, formas, corpora, i, intend, to, speak, of, forms, changed, into, new, entities, accompanying, this, theme, is, often, violence, inflicted, upon, a, victim, whose, transformation, becomes, part, of, the, natural, landscape, this, theme, amalgamates, the, much, explored, opposition, between, the, hunter, and, the, hunted, and, the, thematic, tension, between, art, and, nature, there, is, a, great, variety, among, the, types, of, transformations, that, take, place, from, human, to, inanimate, objects, nileus, constellations, ariadne, s, crown, animals, perdix, and, plants, daphne, baucis, and, philemon, from, animals, ants, and, fungi, mushrooms, to, human, from, one, sex, to, another, hyenas, and, from, one, colour, to, another, pebbles, the, metamorphoses, themselves, are, often, located, metatextually, within, the, poem, through, grammatical, or, narratorial, transformations, at, other, times, transformations, are, developed, into, humour, or, absurdity, such, that, slowly, the, reader, realizes, he, is, being, had, or, the, very, nature, of, transformation, is, questioned, or, subverted, this, phenomenon, is, merely, one, aspect, of, ovid, s, extensive, use, of, illusion, and, disguise, no, work, from, classical, antiquity, either, greek, or, roman, has, exerted, such, a, continuing, and, decisive, influence, on, european, literature, as, ovid, s, metamorphoses, the, emergence, of, french, english, and, italian, national, literatures, in, the, late, middle, ages, simply, cannot, be, fully, understood, without, taking, into, account, the, effect, of, this, extraordinary, poem, the, only, rival, we, have, in, our, tradition, which, we, can, find, to, match, the, pervasiveness, of, the, literary, influence, of, the, metamorphoses, is, perhaps, and, i, stress, perhaps, the, old, testament, and, the, works, of, shakespeare, ian, johnston, the, metamorphoses, has, exerted, a, considerable, influence, on, literature, and, the, arts, particularly, of, the, west, scholar, a, d, melville, says, that, it, may, be, doubted, whether, any, poem, has, had, so, great, an, influence, on, the, literature, and, art, of, western, civilization, as, the, metamorphoses, although, a, majority, of, its, stories, do, not, originate, with, ovid, himself, but, with, such, writers, as, hesiod, and, homer, for, others, the, poem, is, their, sole, source, the, influence, of, the, poem, on, the, works, of, geoffrey, chaucer, is, extensive, in, the, canterbury, tales, the, story, of, coronis, and, phoebus, apollo, book, ii, 531, 632, is, adapted, to, form, the, basis, for, the, manciple, s, tale, the, story, of, midas, book, xi, 174, 193, is, referred, to, and, appears, though, much, altered, in, the, wife, of, bath, s, tale, the, story, of, ceyx, and, alcyone, from, book, ix, is, adapted, by, chaucer, in, his, poem, the, book, of, the, duchess, written, to, commemorate, the, death, of, blanche, duchess, of, lancaster, and, wife, of, john, of, gaunt, the, metamorphoses, was, also, a, considerable, influence, on, william, shakespeare, his, romeo, and, juliet, is, influenced, by, the, story, of, pyramus, and, thisbe, metamorphoses, book, iv,

his, magnum, opus, and, evidently, knew, it, well, and, edmund, spenser, in, italy, the, poem, was, an, influence, on, giovanni, boccaccio, the, story, of, pyramus, and, thisbe, appears, in, his, poem, l, amorosa, fiammetta, and, dante, during, the, renaissance, and, baroque, periods, mythological, subjects, were, frequently, depicted, in, art, the, metamorphoses, was, the, greatest, source, of, these, narratives, such, that, the, term, ovidian, in, this, context, is, synonymous, for, mythological, in, spite, of, some, frequently, represented, myths, not, being, found, in, the, work, many, of, the, stories, from, the, metamorphoses, have, been, the, subject, of, paintings, and, sculptures, particularly, during, this, period, some, of, the, most, well, known, paintings, by, titian, depict, scenes, from, the, poem, including, diana, and, callisto, diana, and, actaeon, and, death, of, actaeon, these, works, form, part, of, titian, s, poesie, a, collection, of, seven, paintings, derived, in, part, from, the, metamorphoses, inspired, by, ancient, greek, and, roman, mythologies, which, were, reunited, in, the, titian, exhibition, at, the, national, gallery, in, 2020, other,

metamorphoses, also, permeated, the, theory, of, art, during, the, renaissance, and, the, baroque, style, with, its, idea, of, transformation, and, the, relation, of, the, myths, of, pygmalion, and, narcissus, to, the, role, of, the, artist, though, ovid, was, popular, for, many, centuries, interest, in, his, work, began, to, wane, after, the, renaissance, and, his, influence, on, 19th, century,

manuscripts, of, varying, value, have, been, passed, down, the, poem, retained, its, popularity, throughout, late, antiquity, and, the, middle, ages, and, is, represented, by, an, extremely, high, number, of, surviving, manuscripts, more, than, 400, the, earliest, of, these, are, three, fragmentary, copies, containing, portions, of, books, 1, 3, dating, to, the, 9th, century, but, the, poem, s, immense, popularity, in, antiquity, and, the, middle, ages, belies, the, struggle, for, survival, it, faced, in, late, antiquity, the, metamorphoses, was, preserved, through, the, roman, period, of, christianization, though, the, metamorphoses, did, not, suffer, the, ignominious, fate, of, the, medea, no, ancient, scholia, on, the, poem, survive, although, they, did, exist, in, antiquity, and, the, earliest, complete, manuscript, is, very, late, dating, from, the, 11th, century, influential, in, the, course, of, the, poem, s, manuscript, tradition, is, the, 17th, century, dutch, scholar, nikolaes, heinsius, during, the, years, 1640, 52, heinsius, collated, more, than, a, hundred, manuscripts, and, was, informed, of, many, others, through, correspondence, collaborative, editorial, effort, has, been, investigating, the, various, manuscripts, of, the, metamorphoses, some, forty, five, complete, texts, or, substantial, fragments, all, deriving, from, a, gallic, archetype, the, result, of, several, centuries, of, critical, reading, is, that, the, poet, s, meaning, is, firmly, established, on, the, basis, of, the, manuscript, tradition, or, restored, by, conjecture, where, the, tradition, is, deficient, there, are, two, modern, critical, editions, william, s, anderson, s, first, published, in, 1977, in, the, teubner, series, and, r, j, tarrant, s, published, in, 2004, by, the, oxford, clarendon, press, the, full, appearance, of, the, metamorphoses, in, english, translation, sections, had, appeared, in, the, works, of, chaucer, and, gower, coincides, with, the, beginning, of, printing, and, traces, a, path, through, the, history, of, publishing, william, caxton, produced, the, first, translation, of, the, text, on, 22, april, 1480, set, in, prose, it, is, a, literal, rendering, of, a, french, translation, known, as, the, ovide, moralis, in, 1567, arthur, golding, published, a, translation, of, the, poem, that, would, become, highly, influential, the, version, read, by, shakespeare, and, spenser, it, was, written, in, rhyming, couplets, of, iambic, heptameter, the, next, significant, translation, was, by, george, sandys, produced, from, 1621, to, 1626, which, set, the, poem, in, heroic, couplets, a, metre, that, would, subsequently, become, dominant, in, vernacular, english, epic, and, in, english, translations, in, 1717, a, translation, appeared, from, samuel, garth, bringing, together, work, by, the, most, eminent, hands, primarily, john, dryden, but, several, stories, by, joseph, addison, one, by, alexander, pope, and, contributions, from, tate, gay, congreve, and, rowe, as, well, as, those, of, eleven, others, including, garth, himself, translation, of, the, metamorphoses, after, this, period, was, comparatively, limited, in, its, achievement, the, garth, volume, continued, to, be, printed, into, the, 1800s, and, had, no, real, rivals, throughout, the, nineteenth, century, around, the, later, half, of, the, 20th, century, a, greater, number, of, translations, appeared, as, literary, translation, underwent, a, revival, this, trend, has, continued, into, the, twenty, first, century, in, 1994, a, collection, of, translations, and, responses, to, the, poem, entitled, after, ovid, new, metamorphoses, was, produced, by, numerous, contributors, in, emulation, of, the, process, of, the, garth, volume, one, of, the, most, famous, translations, of, the, metamorphoses, published, in, france, dates, back, to, 1557, published, under, the, title, la, m, tamorphose, d, ovide, figur, e, the, illustrated, metamorphosis, of, ovid, by, the, maison, tournes, 1542, 1567, in, lyon, it, is, the, result, of, a, collaboration, between, the, publisher, jean, de, tournes, and, bernard, salomon, an, important, 16th, century, engraver, the, publication, is, edited, octavo, format, and, presents, ovid, s, texts, accompanied, by, 178, engraved, illustrations, in, the, years, 1540, 1550, the, spread, of, contemporary, translations, led, to, a, true, race, to, publish, the, ancient, poet, s, texts, among, the, city, of, lyon, s, various, publishers, therefore, jean, de, tournes, faced, fierce, competition, which, also, published, new, editions, of, the, metamorphoses, he, published, the, first, two, books, of, ovid, in, 1456, a, version, that, was, followed, by, an, illustrated, reprint, in, 1549, his, main, competitor, was, guillaume, roville, who, published, the, texts, illustrated, by, pierre, eskrich, in, 1550, and, again, in, 1551, in, 1553, roville, published, the, first, three, books, with, a, translation, by, barth, l, my, aneau, which, followed, the, translation, of, the, first, two, books, by, cl, ment, marot, however, the, 1557, version, published, by, maison, tournes, remains, the, version, that, enjoys, the, greatest, fortune, as, testified, by, historiographical, mentions, the, 16th, century, editions, of, the, metamorphoses, constitute, a, radical, change, in, the, way, myths, are, perceived, in, previous, centuries, the, verses, of, the, ancient, poet, had, been, read, above, all, in, function, of, their, moralising, impact, whereas, from, the, 16th, century, onwards, their, aesthetic, and, hedonistic, quality, was, exalted, the, literary, context, of, the, time, marked, by, the, birth, of, the, pl, iade, is, indicative, of, this, taste, for, the, beauty, of, poetry, the, disappearance, of, the, ars, amatoria, and, the, remedia, amoris, marks, the, end, of, a, gothic, era, in, ovidian, publishing, just, as, the, publication, in, 1557, of, the, m, tamorphose, figur, e, marks, the, appropriation, by, the, renaissance, of, a, work, that, is, as, much, in, line, with, its, tastes, as, the, moralizing, of, the, metamorphoses, had, been, with, the, aspirations, of, the, 14th, and, 15th, centuries, the, work, was, republished, in, french, in, 1564, and, 1583, although, it, had, already, been, published, in, italian, by, gabriel, simeoni, in, 1559, with, some, additional, engravings, some, copies, from, 1557, are, today, held, in, public, collections, namely, the, national, library, of, france, the, municipal, library, of, lyon, the, brandeis, university, library, in, waltham, ma, and, the, library, of, congress, in, washington, d, c, usa, a, digital, copy, is, available, on, gallica, it, would, also, appear, that, a, copy, has, been, auctioned, at, sotheby, s, the, 1557, edition, published, by, jean, de, tournes, features, 178, engravings, by, bernard, salomon, accompanying, ovid, s, text, the, format, is, emblematic, of, the, collaboration, between, tournes, and, salomon, which, has, existed, since, their, association, in, the, mid, 1540s, the, pages, are, developed, centred, around, a, title, an, engraving, with, an, octosyllabic, stanza, and, a, neat, border, the, 178, engravings, were, not, made, all, at, once, for, the, full, text, but, originate, from, a, reissue, of, the, first, two, books, in, 1549, in, 1546, jean, de, tournes, published, a, first, non, illustrated, version, of, the, first, two, books, of, the, metamorphoses, for, which, bernard, salomon, prepared, twenty, two, initial, engravings, salomon, examined, several, earlier, illustrated, editions, of, the, metamorphoses, before, working, on, his, engravings, which, nevertheless, display, a, remarkable, originality, in, the, book, bernard, salomon, illustrateur, lyonnais, peter, sharratt, states, that, the, plates, in, this, edition, along, with, that, of, the, bible, illustrated, by, the, painter, in, 1557, are, salomon, s, works, that, most, emphasise, the, illustrative, process, based, on, a, mixture, of, memories, among, the, earlier, editions, consulted, by, salomon, one, in, particular, stands, out, metamorphoseos, vulgare, published, in, venice, in, 1497, the, latter, shows, similarities, in, the, composition, of, some, episodes, such, as, the, creation, of, the, world, and, apollo, and, daphne, in, drawing, his, figures, salomon, also, used, bellifontaine, s, canon, which, testifies, to, his, early, years, as, a, painter, among, other, works, he, created, some, frescoes, in, lyon, for, which, he, drew, inspiration, from, his, recent, work, in, fontainebleau, better, known, in, his, lifetime, for, his, work, as, a, painter, salomon, s, work, in, la, m, tamorphose, d, ovide, figur, e, nevertheless, left, a, mark, on, his, contemporaries, these, illustrations, contributed, to, the, celebration, of, the, ovidian, texts, in, their, hedonistic, dimension, in, this, respect, panofsky, speaks, of, extraordinarily, influential, woodcuts, and, the, american, art, historian, rensselaer, w, lee, describes, the, work, as, a, major, event, in, the, history, of, art, in, the, mus, e, des, beaux, arts, et, des, fabrics, in, lyon, it, is, possible, to, observe, wooden, panels, reproducing, the, model, of, salomon, s, engravings, for, ovid, s, metamorphoses, of, 1557
