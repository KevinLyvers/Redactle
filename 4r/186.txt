erections, and, the, missile, strikes, and, his, associate, statistician, roger, mexico, who, suggests, that, the, relationship, is, only, a, random, coincidence, of, probabilities, as, seen, in, poisson, distributions, leading, to, further, reflections, in, this, section, and, later, on, topics, as, broad, as, the, occult, determinism, the, reverse, flow, of, time, and, the, sexuality, of, the, rocket, itself, pointsman, is, all, the, more, intrigued, to, find, that, as, a, baby, slothrop, had, been, subjected, to, behavioral, experiments, conducted, by, a, dr, laszlo, jamf, that, involved, the, stimulation, of, his, penis, to, erections, many, characters, not, significant, until, later, are, introduced, in, beyond, the, zero, including, one, of, dr, jamf, s, former, students,

used, to, meet, her, father, slothrop, finds, out, more, about, his, childhood, and, the, 00000, it, becomes, steadily, apparent, that, slothrop, is, connected, to, laszlo, jamf, through, lyle, bland,

is, actually, leni, p, kler, recently, freed, from, a, concentration, camp, herself, in, the, same, building, major, marvy, has, found, slothrop, s, pig, costume, and, dons, it, only, to, be, caught, sedated, and, castrated, by, agents, working, for, pointsman, who, believe, that, slothrop, is, still, in, the, suit, major, political, and, social, realignments, have, been, taking, place, throughout, the, zone, towards, the, end, of, this, section, several, characters, not, seen, since, early, in, the, novel, make, a, return, including, pointsman, who, is, now, in, official, disgrace, as, bureaucratic, operatives, consider, how, to, deal, with, him, other, characters, including, pirate, prentice, and, katje, borgesius, begin, to, coalesce, as, a, group, styling, itself, as, the, counterforce, in, resistance, to, the, emerging, post, war, military, industrial, complex, part, four, the, counterforce, elements, in, this, section, become, increasingly, fantastic, and, sometimes, self, referential, the, narrator, at, one, point, saying, you, will, want, cause, and, effect, all, right, page, 663, in, the, viking, edition, before, explaining, how, certain, events, in, part, 3, tie, in, despite, the, efforts, of, some, to, save, him, slothrop, is, repeatedly, sidetracked, until, his, persona, fragments, totally, more, than, one, hundred, pages, before, the, novel, s, end, a, flashback, reveals, how, roger, mexico, now, in, germany, has, come, to, join, the, counterforce, despite, its, inherent, contradictions, as, a, group, organizing, against, international, organizations, a, long, digression, gives, the, story, of, byron, the, bulb, a, sentient, seemingly, immortal, lightbulb, whose, existence, links, with, dr, jamf, and, his, experiments, and, to, the, integration, of, power, companies, and, their, grid, to, the, network, of, cartels, the, schwarzkommando, become, reunited, and, finish, construction, of, their, own, version, of, the, 00000, rocket, there, are, several, brief, hallucinatory, stories, of, comic, fallible, superheroes, silly, kamikaze, pilots, and, an, incident, in, the, transvestites, toilet, where, slothrop, has, been, hiding, in, drag, such, incidents, may, be, products, of, slothrop, s, finally, collapsed, mind, or, of, the, increasingly, chaotic, state, of, affairs, outside, the, realm, of, a, rising, technological, class, and, society, that, comes, to, be, labeled, the, raketen, stadt, rocket, state, of, the, future, for, slothrop, these, scenes, more, or, less, culminate, with, his, finding, and, failing, to, understand, a, headline, announcing, the, atomic, bombing, of, hiroshima, tchitcherine, is, told, by, his, superior, officer, that, he, is, to, head, back, to, the, u, s, s, r, with, some, german, rocket, scientists, despite, his, own, misgivings, about, marxist, dialectics, a, conference, is, held, by, members, of, the, counterforce, which, now, includes, some, with, questionable, pasts, personalities, or, motives, such, as, von, g, ll, jessica, tells, roger, that, she, is, going, to, marry, jeremy, beaver, invited, to, a, dinner, at, the, home, of, a, german, industrialist, roger, and, pig, bodine, manage, to, escape, with, the, help, of, some, disgusting, culinary, repartee, but, it, becomes, increasingly, clear, that, the, counterforce, does, not, have, the, capacity, to, counter, the, emerging, rocket, state, in, part, because, the, man, has, a, branch, office, in, each, of, our, brains, some, individuals, however, provide, some, hope, earlier, slothrop, had, encountered, the, young, boy, ludwig, on, what, seems, to, be, a, futile, quest, to, find, his, lost, pet, lemming, meeting, once, again, it, turns, out, that, the, lemming, has, been, found, geli, tripping, s, complete, love, for, tchitcherine, and, her, connection, with, the, natural, organic, world, contrasts, with, a, flashback, in, which, blicero, explains, to, gottfried, his, obsessive, desire, to, transcend, nature, and, its, cycle, of, infection, and, death, geli, does, cast, a, spell, on, tchitcherine, that, perhaps, keeps, him, from, recognizing, enzian, when, they, finally, meet, averting, a, potentially, fatal, encounter, the, final, identification, of, slothrop, of, any, certainty, is, his, picture, on, the, cover, of, an, album, by, obscure, english, band, the, fool,

poet, l, e, sissman, in, his, gravity, s, rainbow, review, for, the, new, yorker, said, of, pynchon, he, is, almost, a, mathematician, of, prose, who, calculates, the, least, and, the, greatest, stress, each, word, and, line, each, pun, and, ambiguity, can, bear, and, applies, his, knowledge, accordingly, and, virtually, without, lapses, though, he, takes, many, scary, bracing, linguistic, risks, thus, his, remarkably, supple, diction, can, first, treat, a, painful, and, delicate, love, scene, and, then, roar, without, pause, into, the, sounds, and, echoes, of, a, drudged, and, drunken, orgy, the, plot, of, the, novel, is, complex, containing, over, 400, characters, and, involving, many, different, threads, of, narrative, which, intersect, and, weave, around, one, another, the, recurring, themes, throughout, the, plot, are, the, v, 2, rocket, interplay, between, free, will, and, calvinistic, predestination, breaking, the, cycle, of, nature, behavioral, psychology, sexuality, paranoia, and, conspiracy, theories, such, as, the, phoebus, cartel, and, the, illuminati, gravity, s, rainbow, also, draws, heavily, on, themes, that, pynchon, had, probably, encountered, at, his, work, as, a, technical, writer, for, boeing, where, he, edited, a, support, newsletter, for, the, bomarc, missile, program, support, unit, the, boeing, archives, are, known, to, house, a, vast, library, of, historical, v, 2, rocket, documents, which, were, probably, accessible, to, pynchon, the, novel, is, narrated, by, many, distinct, voices, a, technique, further, developed, in, pynchon, s, much, later, novel, against, the, day, the, style, and, tone, of, the, voices, vary, widely, some, narrate, the, plot, in, a, highly, informal, tone, some, are, more, self, referential, and, some, might, even, break, the, fourth, wall, some, voices, narrate, in, drastically, different, formats, ranging, from, movie, script, format, to, stream, of, consciousness, prose, the, narrative, contains, numerous, descriptions, of, illicit, sexual, encounters, and, drug, use, by, the, main, characters, and, supporting, cast, sandwiched, between, dense, dialogues, or, reveries, on, historic, artistic, scientific, or, philosophical, subjects, interspersed, with, whimsical, nonsense, poems, and, allusions, to, obscure, facets, of, 1940s, pop, culture, many, of, the, recurring, themes, will, be, familiar, to, experienced, pynchon, readers, including, the, singing, of, silly, songs, recurring, appearances, of, kazoos, and, extensive, discussion, of, paranoia, according, to, richard, locke, megalomaniac, paranoia, is, the, operative, emotion, behind, the, novel, and, an, increasingly, central, motivator, for, the, many, main, characters, in, many, cases, this, paranoia, proves, to, be, vindicated, as, the, many, plots, of, the, novel, become, increasingly, interconnected, revolving, around, the, identity, and, purpose, of, the, elusive, 00000, rocket, and, schwarzger, t, the, novel, becomes, increasingly, preoccupied, with, themes, of, tarot, paranoia, and, sacrifice, all, three, themes, culminate, in, the, novel, s, ending, and, the, epilogue, of, the, many, characters, the, novel, also, features, the, character, pig, bodine, of, pynchon, s, novel, v, bodine, would, later, become, a, recurring, avatar, of, pynchon, s, complex, and, interconnected, fictional, universe,

eponymous, character, kurt, mondaugen, also, reappears, in, gravity, s, rainbow, some, early, reviewers, even, suggested, that, gravity, s, rainbow, was, a, sequel, to, pynchon, s, first, novel, playing, on, the, term, v, 2, in, gravity, s, rainbow, clayton, bloody, chiclitz, is, a, toy, manufacturer, accompanying, major, marvy, but, he, appeared, later, as, a, defense, contract, magnate, in, the, crying, of, lot, 49, and, his, company, yoyodyne, was, introduced, in, v, pig, bodine, also, appeared, in, v, but, had, his, origin, in, pynchon, s, early, short, story, low, lands, bodine, or, variants, on, his, name, and, character, also, appear, in, later, pynchon, novels, a, very, minor, character, in, gravity, s, rainbow, ronald, cherrycoke, would, seem, to, be, a, descendant, of, the,

cover, edition, was, priced, expensively, at, 15, equivalent, to, 103, in, 2023, viking, s, president, thomas, guinzburg, worried, that, the, novel, s, high, price, was, potentially, inhibiting, leading, the, publisher, to, take, the, uncommon, move, of, simultaneously, publishing, a, soft, cover, edition, at, 4, 95, equivalent, to, 34, in, 2023, on, the, novel, s, publication, it, was, reviewed, in, the, new, york, times, by, richard, locke, under, the, headline, one, of, the, longest, most, difficult, most, ambitious, novels, in, years, locke, compared, pynchon, s, writing, to, that, of, vladimir, nabokov, and, wrote, that, its, technical, and, verbal, resources, bring, to, mind, melville, and, faulkner, immersing, himself, in, the, destructive, element, and, exploring, paranoia, entropy, and, the, love, of, death, as, primary, forces, in, the, history, of, our, time, pynchon, establishes, his, imaginative, continuity, with, the, great, modernist, writers, of, the, early, years, of, this, century, locke, noted, that, pynchon, is, obviously, capable, of, the, most, intricate, literary, structures, plots, and, counterplots, and, symbols, that, twist, and, tangle, in, time, and, space, but, was, less, impressed, by, the, novel, s, form, the, structure, is, strained, beyond, the, breaking, point, reading, it, is, often, profoundly, exasperating, the, book, is, too, long, and, dense, despite, the, cornucopia, of, brilliant, details, and, grand, themes, one, s, dominant, feelings, in, the, last, one, to, two, hundred, pages, are, a, mounting, restlessness, fatigue, and, frustration, reviewing, the, novel, in, the, saturday, review, in, march, 1973, richard, poirier, stated, that, at, thirty, six, pynchon, has, established, himself, as, a, novelist, of, major, importance, in, the, highly, positive, review, poirier, compared, gravity, s, rainbow, to, moby, dick, and, ulysses, and, that, it, marks, an, advance, beyond, either, book, in, its, treatment, of, cultural, inheritance, poirier, noted, the, wide, range, of, pynchon, s, writing, and, said, that, pynchon, is, willing, and, able, that, is, to, work, from, a, range, of, perspectives, infinitely, wider, more, difficult, to, manage, more, learned, than, any, to, be, found, elsewhere, in, contemporary, literature, his, genius, resides, in, his, capacity, to, see, to, see, feelingly, how, these, various, perspectives, apparently, so, diverse, and, chaotic, are, begotten, of, the, same, technology, the, same, supportive, structures, that, have, foundations, in, the, theology, of, the, seventeenth, century, and, the, science, of, the, nineteenth, pynchon, is, almost, unbearably, vulnerable, to, every, aspect, of, contemporary, experience, open, to, every, form, of, sight, and, sound, democratically, receptive, to, the, most, common, and, the, most, recondite, signatures, of, things, reviewing, the, novel, in, a, swedish, publication, author, and, critic, artur, lundkvist, noted, pynchon, s, rare, talent, but, was, critical, about, the, wide, range, of, the, novel, pynchon, s, weakness, appears, to, be, criticlessness, a, lack, of, values, indiscriminate, inclusion, nothing, is, too, high, or, too, low, to, put, into, his, all, consuming, machinery, but, that, makes, the, meaning, of, his, work, ambivalent, or, undetermined, despite, the, enormous, power, of, expression, and, energy, in, his, writing, lundkvist, criticized, the, influences, from, popular, culture, in, the, novel, and, concluded, how, obvious, the, frequent, transitions, between, shameless, entertainment, and, ambitious, novel, art, is, he, runs, the, risk, of, repelling, two, opposite, types, of, readers, where, some, find, it, irresistibly, funny, others, will, find, it, wearisome, and, boring, pynchon, s, uncommon, flexible, and, at, the, same, time, consumedly, schizoid, talent, runs, the, risk, of, drowning, in, the, rampant, excess, anthony, burgess, included, gravity, s, rainbow, in, his, ninety, nine, novels, the, best, in, english, since, 1939, 1984, writing, this, work, not, yet, as, widely, understood, has, a, gravity, more, compelling, than, the, rainbow,

historical, novels, of, our, time, and, arguably, the, most, important, literary, text, since, ulysses, though, the, book, won, the, national, book, award, for, 1974, pynchon, chose, neither, to, accept, nor, acknowledge, this, award, thomas, guinzberg, of, the, viking, press, suggested, that, the, comedian, professor, irwin, corey, accept, the, award, on, his, behalf, to, which, pynchon,
