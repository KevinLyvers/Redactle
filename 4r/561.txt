les, demoiselles, d, avignon, the, young, ladies, of, avignon, originally, titled, the, brothel, of, avignon, is, a, large, oil, painting, created, in, 1907, by, the, spanish, artist, pablo, picasso, part, of, the, permanent, collection, of, the, museum, of, modern, art, in, new, york, it, portrays, five, nude, female, prostitutes, in, a, brothel, on, carrer, d, aviny, a, street, in, barcelona, spain, the, figures, are, confrontational, and, not, conventionally, feminine, being, rendered, with, angular, and, disjointed, body, shapes, some, to, a, menacing, degree, the, far, left, figure, exhibits, facial, features, and, dress, of, egyptian, or, southern, asian, style, the, two, adjacent, figures, are, in, an, iberian, style, of, picasso, s, spain, while, the, two, on, the, right, have, african, mask, like, features, picasso, said, the, ethnic, primitivism, evoked, in, these, masks, moved, him, to, liberate, an, utterly, original, artistic, style, of, compelling, even, savage, force, leading, him, to, add, a, shamanistic, aspect, to, his, project, drawing, from, tribal, primitivism, while, eschewing, central, dictates, of, renaissance, perspective, and, verisimilitude, for, a, compressed, picture, plane, using, a, baroque, composition, while, employing, velazquez, s, confrontational, approach, seen, in, las, meninas, picasso, sought, to, take, the, lead, of, the, avant, garde, from, henri, matisse, john, richardson, said, demoiselles, made, picasso, the, most, pivotal, artist, in, western, painting, since, giotto, and, laid, a, path, forward, for, picasso, and, georges, braque, to, follow, in, their, joint, development, of, cubism, the, effects, of, which, on, modern, art, were, profound, and, unsurpassed, in, the, 20th, century, les, demoiselles, was, revolutionary, controversial, and, led, to, widespread, anger, and, disagreement, even, amongst, the, painter, s, closest, associates, and, friends, henri, matisse, considered, the, work, something, of, a, bad, joke, yet, indirectly, reacted, to, it, in, his, 1908, bathers, with, a, turtle, georges, braque, too, initially, disliked, the, painting, yet, studied, the, work, in, great, detail, his, subsequent, friendship, and, collaboration, with, picasso, led, to, the, cubist, revolution, its, resemblance, to, c, zanne, s, the, bathers, paul, gauguin, s, statue, oviri, and, el, greco, s, opening, of, the, fifth, seal, has, been, widely, discussed, by, later, critics, at, the, time, of, its, first, exhibition, in, 1916, the, painting, was, deemed, immoral, painted, in, picasso, s, studio, in, the, bateau, lavoir, in, montmartre, paris, it, was, seen, publicly, for, the, first, time, at, the, salon, d, antin, in, july, 1916, at, an, exhibition, organized, by, the, poet, andr, salmon, it, was, at, this, exhibition, that, salmon, who, had, previously, titled, the, painting, in, 1912, le, bordel, philosophique, renamed, it, to, its, current, less, scandalous, title, les, demoiselles, d, avignon, instead, of, the, title, originally, chosen, by, picasso, le, bordel, d, avignon, picasso, who, always, referred, to, it, as, mon, bordel, my, brothel, or, le, bordel, d, avignon, never, liked, salmon, s, title, and, would, have, instead, preferred, the, bowdlerization, las, chicas, de, avignon, the, girls, of, avignon, picasso, came, into, his, own, as, an, important, artist, during, the, first, decade, of, the, 20th, century, he, arrived, in, paris, from, spain, around, the, turn, of, the, century, as, a, young, ambitious, painter, out, to, make, a, name, for, himself, for, several, years, he, alternated, between, living, and, working, in, barcelona, madrid, and, the, spanish, countryside, and, made, frequent, trips, to, paris, by, 1904, he, was, fully, settled, in, paris, and, had, established, several, studios, important, relationships, with, both, friends, and, colleagues, between, 1901, and, 1904, picasso, began, to, achieve, recognition, for, his, blue, period, paintings, in, the, main, these, were, studies, of, poverty, and, desperation, based, on, scenes, he, had, seen, in, spain, and, paris, at, the, turn, of, the, century, subjects, included, gaunt, families, blind, figures, and, personal, encounters, other, paintings, depicted, his, friends, but, most, reflected, and, expressed, a, sense, of, blueness, and, despair, he, followed, his, success, by, developing, into, his, rose, period, from, 1904, to, 1907, which, introduced, a, strong, element, of, sensuality, and, sexuality, into, his, work, the, rose, period, depictions, of, acrobats, circus, performers, and, theatrical, characters, are, rendered, in, warmer, brighter, colors, and, are, far, more, hopeful, and, joyful, in, their, depictions, of, the, bohemian, life, in, the, parisian, avant, garde, and, its, environs, the, rose, period, produced, two, important, large, masterpieces, family, of, saltimbanques, 1905, which, recalls, the, work, of, gustave, courbet, 1819, 1877, and, douard, manet, 1832, 1883, and, boy, leading, a, horse, 1905, 06, which, recalls, c, zanne, s, bather, 1885, 1887, and, el, greco, s, saint, martin, and, the, beggar, 1597, 1599, while, he, already, had, a, considerable, following, by, the, middle, of, 1906, picasso, enjoyed, further, success, with, his, paintings, of, massive, oversized, nude, women, monumental, sculptural, figures, that, recalled, the, work, of, paul, gauguin, and, showed, his, interest, in, primitive, african, micronesian, native, american, art, he, began, exhibiting, his, work, in, the, galleries, of, berthe, weill, 1865, 1951, and, ambroise, vollard, 1866, 1939, quickly, gaining, a, growing, reputation, and, a, following, amongst, the, artistic, communities, of, montmartre, and, montparnasse, picasso, became, a, favorite, of, the, american, art, collectors, gertrude, stein, and, her, brother, leo, around, 1905, the, steins, older, brother, michael, and, his, wife, sarah, also, became, collectors, of, his, work, picasso, painted, portraits, of, both, gertrude, stein, and, her, nephew, allan, stein, gertrude, stein, began, acquiring, picasso, s, drawings, and, paintings, and, exhibiting, them, in, her, informal, salon, at, her, home, in, paris, at, one, of, her, gatherings, in, 1905, he, met, henri, matisse, 1869, 1954, who, was, to, become, in, those, days, his, chief, rival, although, in, later, years, a, close, friend, the, steins, introduced, picasso, to, claribel, cone, 1864, 1929, and, her, sister, etta, cone, 1870, 1949, also, american, art, collectors, who, began, to, acquire, picasso, and, matisse, s, paintings, eventually, leo, stein, moved, to, italy, and, michael, and, sarah, stein, became, important, patrons, of, matisse, while, gertrude, stein, continued, to, collect, picasso, the, salon, d, automne, of, 1905, brought, notoriety, and, attention, to, the, works, of, henri, matisse, and, the, les, fauves, group, the, latter, gained, their, name, after, critic, louis, vauxcelles, described, their, work, with, the, phrase, donatello, chez, les, fauves, donatello, among, the, wild, beasts, contrasting, the, paintings, with, a, renaissance, type, sculpture, that, shared, the, room, with, them, henri, rousseau, 1844, 1910, an, artist, whom, picasso, knew, and, admired, and, who, was, not, a, fauve, had, his, large, jungle, scene, the, hungry, lion, throws, itself, on, the, antelope, also, hanging, near, the, works, by, matisse, and, which, may, have, had, an, influence, on, the, particular, sarcastic, term, used, in, the, press, vauxcelles, comment, was, printed, on, 17, october, 1905, in, the, daily, newspaper, gil, blas, and, passed, into, popular, usage, although, the, pictures, were, widely, derided, a, pot, of, paint, has, been, flung, in, the, face, of, the, public, declared, the, critic, camille, mauclair, 1872, 1945, they, also, attracted, some, favorable, attention, the, painting, that, was, singled, out, for, the, most, attacks, was, matisse, s, woman, with, a, hat, the, purchase, of, this, work, by, gertrude, and, leo, stein, had, a, very, positive, effect, on, matisse, who, was, suffering, demoralization, from, the, bad, reception, of, his, work, matisse, s, notoriety, and, preeminence, as, the, leader, of, the, new, movement, in, modern, painting, continued, to, build, throughout, 1906, and, 1907, and, matisse, attracted, a, following, of, artists, including, georges, braque, 1880, 1963, andr, derain, 1880, 1954, maurice, de, vlaminck, 1876, 1958, picasso, s, work, had, passed, through, his, blue, period, and, his, rose, period, and, while, he, had, a, considerable, following, his, reputation, was, tame, in, comparison, to, his, rival, matisse, the, larger, theme, of, matisse, s, influential, le, bonheur, de, vivre, an, exploration, of, the, golden, age, evokes, the, historic, ages, of, man, theme, and, the, potentials, of, a, provocative, new, age, that, the, twentieth, century, era, offered, an, equally, bold, similarly, themed, painting, titled, the, golden, age, completed, by, derain, in, 1905, shows, the, transfer, of, human, ages, in, an, even, more, direct, way, matisse, and, derain, shocked, the, french, public, again, at, the, march, 1907, soci, t, des, artistes, ind, pendants, when, matisse, exhibited, his, painting, blue, nude, and, derain, contributed, the, bathers, both, paintings, evoke, ideas, of, human, origins, world, beginnings, evolution, an, increasingly, important, theme, in, paris, at, this, time, the, blue, nude, was, one, of, the, paintings, that, would, later, create, an, international, sensation, at, the, armory, show, of, 1913, in, new, york, city, from, october, 1906, when, he, began, preparatory, work, for, les, demoiselles, d, avignon, until, its, completion, in, march, 1907, picasso, was, vying, with, matisse, to, be, perceived, as, the, leader, of, modern, painting, upon, its, completion, the, shock, and, the, impact, of, the, painting, propelled, picasso, into, the, center, of, controversy, and, all, but, knocked, matisse, and, fauvism, off, the, map, virtually, ending, the, movement, by, the, following, year, in, 1907, picasso, joined, the, art, gallery, that, had, recently, been, opened, in, paris, by, daniel, henry, kahnweiler, 1884, 1979, kahnweiler, was, a, german, art, historian, and, collector, who, became, one, of, the, premier, french, art, dealers, of, the, 20th, century, he, became, prominent, in, paris, beginning, in, 1907, for, being, among, the, first, champions, of, picasso, and, especially, his, painting, les, demoiselles, d, avignon, before, 1910, picasso, was, already, being, recognized, as, one, of, the, important, leaders, of, modern, art, alongside, henri, matisse, who, had, been, the, undisputed, leader, of, fauvism, and, who, was, more, than, ten, years, older, than, he, and, his, contemporaries, the, fauvist, andr, derain, and, the, former, fauvist, and, fellow, cubist, georges, braque, in, his, 1992, essay, reflections, on, matisse, the, art, critic, hilton, kramer, wrote, after, the, impact, of, les, demoiselles, d, avignon, however, matisse, was, never, again, mistaken, for, an, avant, garde, incendiary, with, the, bizarre, painting, that, appalled, and, electrified, the, cognoscenti, which, understood, the, les, demoiselles, was, at, once, a, response, to, matisse, s, le, bonheur, de, vivre, 1905, 1906, and, an, assault, upon, the, tradition, from, which, it, derived, picasso, effectively, appropriated, the, role, of, avant, garde, wild, beast, a, role, that, as, far, as, public, opinion, was, concerned, he, was, never, to, relinquish, kramer, goes, on, to, say, whereas, matisse, had, drawn, upon, a, long, tradition, of, european, painting, from, giorgione, poussin, and, watteau, to, ingres, c, zanne, and, gauguin, to, create, a, modern, version, of, a, pastoral, paradise, in, le, bonheur, de, vivre, picasso, had, turned, to, an, alien, tradition, of, primitive, art, to, create, in, les, demoiselles, a, netherworld, of, strange, gods, and, violent, emotions, as, between, the, mythological, nymphs, of, le, bonheur, de, vivre, and, the, grotesque, effigies, of, les, demoiselles, there, was, no, question, as, to, which, was, the, more, shocking, or, more, intended, to, be, shocking, picasso, had, unleashed, a, vein, of, feeling, that, was, to, have, immense, consequences, for, the, art, and, culture, of, the, modern, era, while, matisse, s, ambition, came, to, seem, as, he, said, in, his, notes, of, a, painter, more, limited, limited, that, is, to, the, realm, of, aesthetic, pleasure, there, was, thus, opened, up, in, the, very, first, decade, of, the, century, and, in, the, work, of, its, two, greatest, artists, the, chasm, that, has, continued, to, divide, the, art, of, the, modern, era, down, to, our, own, time, picasso, created, hundreds, of, sketches, and, studies, in, preparation, for, the, final, work, he, long, acknowledged, the, importance, of, spanish, art, and, iberian, sculpture, as, influences, on, the, painting, the, work, is, believed, by, critics, to, be, influenced, by, african, tribal, masks, and, the, art, of, oceania, although, picasso, denied, the, connection, many, art, historians, remain, skeptical, about, his, denials, picasso, spent, an, october, 1906, evening, closely, studying, a, teke, figure, from, congo, then, owned, by, matisse, it, was, later, that, night, that, picasso, s, first, studies, for, what, would, become, les, demoiselles, d, avignon, were, created, several, experts, maintain, that, at, the, very, least, picasso, visited, the, mus, e, d, ethnographie, du, trocad, ro, known, later, as, the, mus, e, de, l, homme, in, the, spring, of, 1907, where, he, saw, and, sought, inspiration, from, african, and, other, arts, shortly, before, completing, les, demoiselles, he, had, come, to, this, museum, originally, to, study, plaster, casts, of, medieval, sculptures, then, also, considered, examples, of, primitive, art, in, 1907, when, picasso, began, work, on, les, demoiselles, one, of, the, old, master, painters, he, greatly, admired, was, el, greco, 1541, 1614, who, at, the, time, was, largely, obscure, and, under, appreciated, picasso, s, friend, ignacio, zuloaga, 1870, 1945, acquired, el, greco, s, masterpiece, the, opening, of, the, fifth, seal, in, 1897, for, 1000, pesetas, the, relation, between, les, demoiselles, d, avignon, and, the, opening, of, the, fifth, seal, was, pinpointed, in, the, early, 1980s, when, the, stylistic, similarities, and, the, relationship, between, the, motifs, and, visually, identifying, qualities, of, both, works, were, analyzed, el, greco, s, painting, which, picasso, studied, repeatedly, in, zuloaga, s, house, inspired, not, only, the, size, format, and, composition, of, les, demoiselles, d, avignon, but, also, its, apocalyptic, power, later, speaking, of, the, work, to, dor, de, la, souch, re, in, antibes, picasso, said, in, any, case, only, the, execution, counts, from, this, point, of, view, it, is, correct, to, say, that, cubism, has, a, spanish, origin, and, that, i, invented, cubism, we, must, look, for, the, spanish, influence, in, c, zanne, things, themselves, necessitate, it, the, influence, of, el, greco, a, venetian, painter, on, him, but, his, structure, is, cubist, the, relationship, of, the, painting, to, other, group, portraits, in, the, western, tradition, such, as, diana, and, callisto, by, titian, 1488, 1576, and, the, same, subject, by, rubens, 1577, 1640, in, the, prado, has, also, been, discussed, paul, gauguin, 1848, 1903, and, paul, c, zanne, 1839, 1906, were, accorded, major, posthumous, retrospective, exhibitions, at, the, salon, d, automne, in, paris, between, 1903, and, 1907, and, both, were, important, influences, on, picasso, and, instrumental, to, his, creation, of, les, demoiselles, according, to, the, english, art, historian, collector, and, author, of, the, cubist, epoch, douglas, cooper, both, of, those, artists, were, particularly, influential, to, the, formation, of, cubism, and, especially, important, to, the, paintings, of, picasso, during, 1906, and, 1907, cooper, goes, on, to, say, however, les, demoiselles, is, often, erroneously, referred, to, as, the, first, cubist, painting, he, explains, the, demoiselles, is, generally, referred, to, as, the, first, cubist, picture, this, is, an, exaggeration, for, although, it, was, a, major, first, step, towards, cubism, it, is, not, yet, cubist, the, disruptive, expressionist, element, in, it, is, even, contrary, to, the, spirit, of, cubism, which, looked, at, the, world, in, a, detached, realistic, spirit, nevertheless, the, demoiselles, is, the, logical, picture, to, take, as, the, starting, point, for, cubism, because, it, marks, the, birth, of, a, new, pictorial, idiom, because, in, it, picasso, violently, overturned, established, conventions, and, because, all, that, followed, grew, out, of, it, although, not, well, known, to, the, general, public, prior, to, 1906, c, zanne, s, reputation, was, highly, regarded, in, avant, garde, circles, as, evidenced, by, ambroise, vollard, s, interest, in, showing, and, collecting, his, work, and, by, leo, stein, s, interest, picasso, was, familiar, with, much, of, c, zanne, s, work, that, he, saw, at, vollard, s, gallery, and, at, the, stein, s, after, c, zanne, died, in, 1906, his, paintings, were, exhibited, in, paris, in, a, large, scale, museum, like, retrospective, in, september, 1907, the, 1907, c, zanne, retrospective, at, the, salon, d, automne, greatly, impacted, the, direction, that, the, avant, garde, in, paris, took, lending, credence, to, his, position, as, one, of, the, most, influential, artists, of, the, 19th, century, and, to, the, advent, of, cubism, the, 1907, c, zanne, exhibition, was, enormously, influential, in, establishing, c, zanne, as, an, important, painter, whose, ideas, were, particularly, resonant, especially, to, young, artists, in, paris, both, picasso, and, braque, found, the, inspiration, for, their, proto, cubist, works, in, paul, c, zanne, who, said, to, observe, and, learn, to, see, and, treat, nature, as, if, it, were, composed, of, basic, shapes, like, cubes, spheres, cylinders, and, cones, c, zanne, s, explorations, of, geometric, simplification, and, optical, phenomena, inspired, picasso, braque, metzinger, gleizes, robert, delaunay, le, fauconnier, gris, and, others, to, experiment, with, ever, more, complex, multiple, views, of, the, same, subject, and, eventually, to, the, fracturing, of, form, c, zanne, thus, sparked, one, of, the, most, revolutionary, areas, of, artistic, enquiry, of, the, 20th, century, one, which, was, to, affect, profoundly, the, development, of, modern, art, during, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, the, european, cultural, elite, were, discovering, african, oceanic, and, native, american, art, artists, such, as, paul, gauguin, henri, matisse, and, picasso, were, intrigued, and, inspired, by, the, stark, power, and, simplicity, of, styles, of, those, cultures, around, 1906, picasso, matisse, derain, and, other, artists, in, paris, had, acquired, an, interest, in, primitivism, iberian, sculpture, african, art, and, tribal, masks, in, part, because, of, the, compelling, works, of, paul, gauguin, that, had, suddenly, achieved, center, stage, in, the, avant, garde, circles, of, paris, gauguin, s, powerful, posthumous, retrospective, exhibitions, at, the, salon, d, automne, in, paris, in, 1903, and, an, even, larger, one, in, 1906, had, a, stunning, and, powerful, influence, on, picasso, s, paintings, in, the, autumn, of, 1906, picasso, followed, his, previous, successes, with, paintings, of, oversized, nude, women, and, monumental, sculptural, figures, that, recalled, the, work, of, paul, gauguin, and, showed, his, interest, in, primitive, art, pablo, picasso, s, paintings, of, massive, figures, from, 1906, were, directly, influenced, by, gauguin, s, sculpture, painting, and, his, writing, as, well, according, to, gauguin, biographer, david, sweetman, pablo, picasso, as, early, as, 1902, became, an, aficionado, of, gauguin, s, work, when, he, met, and, befriended, the, expatriate, spanish, sculptor, and, ceramist, paco, durrio, in, paris, durrio, had, several, of, gauguin, s, works, on, hand, because, he, was, a, friend, of, gauguin, s, and, an, unpaid, agent, of, his, work, durrio, tried, to, help, his, poverty, stricken, friend, in, tahiti, by, promoting, his, oeuvre, in, paris, after, they, met, durrio, introduced, picasso, to, gauguin, s, stoneware, helped, picasso, make, some, ceramic, pieces, and, gave, picasso, a, first, la, plume, edition, of, noa, noa, the, tahiti, journal, of, paul, gauguin, concerning, gauguin, s, impact, on, picasso, art, historian, john, richardson, wrote, the, 1906, exhibition, of, gauguin, s, work, left, picasso, more, than, ever, in, this, artist, s, thrall, gauguin, demonstrated, the, most, disparate, types, of, art, not, to, speak, of, elements, from, metaphysics, ethnology, symbolism, the, bible, classical, myths, and, much, else, besides, could, be, combined, into, a, synthesis, that, was, of, its, time, yet, timeless, an, artist, could, also, confound, conventional, notions, of, beauty, he, demonstrated, by, harnessing, his, demons, to, the, dark, gods, not, necessarily, tahitian, ones, and, tapping, a, new, source, of, divine, energy, if, in, later, years, picasso, played, down, his, debt, to, gauguin, there, is, no, doubt, that, between, 1905, and, 1907, he, felt, a, very, close, kinship, with, this, other, paul, who, prided, himself, on, spanish, genes, inherited, from, his, peruvian, grandmother, had, not, picasso, signed, himself, paul, in, gauguin, s, honor, both, david, sweetman, and, john, richardson, point, to, gauguin, s, oviri, literally, meaning, savage, a, gruesome, phallic, representation, of, the, tahitian, goddess, of, life, and, death, intended, for, gauguin, s, grave, first, exhibited, in, the, 1906, retrospective, it, was, likely, a, direct, influence, on, les, demoiselles, sweetman, writes, gauguin, s, statue, oviri, which, was, prominently, displayed, in, 1906, was, to, stimulate, picasso, s, interest, in, both, sculpture, and, ceramics, while, the, woodcuts, would, reinforce, his, interest, in, print, making, though, it, was, the, element, of, the, primitive, in, all, of, them, which, most, conditioned, the, direction, that, picasso, s, art, would, take, this, interest, would, culminate, in, the, seminal, les, demoiselles, d, avignon, according, to, richardson, picasso, s, interest, in, stoneware, was, further, stimulated, by, the, examples, he, saw, at, the, 1906, gauguin, retrospective, at, the, salon, d, automne, the, most, disturbing, of, those, ceramics, one, that, picasso, might, have, already, seen, at, vollard, s, was, the, gruesome, oviri, until, 1987, when, the, mus, e, d, orsay, acquired, this, little, known, work, exhibited, only, once, since, 1906, it, had, never, been, recognized, as, the, masterpiece, it, is, let, alone, recognized, for, its, relevance, to, the, works, leading, up, to, the, demoiselles, although, just, under, 30, inches, high, oviri, has, an, awesome, presence, as, befits, a, monument, intended, for, gauguin, s, grave, picasso, was, very, struck, by, oviri, 50, years, later, he, was, delighted, when, cooper, and, i, told, him, that, we, had, come, upon, this, sculpture, in, a, collection, that, also, included, the, original, plaster, of, his, cubist, head, has, it, been, a, revelation, like, iberian, sculpture, picasso, s, shrug, was, grudgingly, affirmative, he, was, always, loath, to, admit, gauguin, s, role, in, setting, him, on, the, road, to, primitivism, during, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, europe, s, colonization, of, africa, led, to, many, economic, social, political, and, even, artistic, encounters, from, these, encounters, western, visual, artists, became, increasingly, interested, in, the, unique, forms, of, african, art, particularly, masks, from, the, niger, congo, region, in, an, essay, by, dennis, duerden, author, of, african, art, 1968, the, invisible, present, 1972, and, a, former, director, of, the, bbc, world, service, the, mask, is, defined, as, very, often, a, complete, head, dress, and, not, just, that, part, that, conceals, the, face, this, form, of, visual, art, and, image, appealed, to, western, visual, artists, leading, to, what, duerden, calls, the, discovery, of, african, art, by, western, practitioners, including, picasso, the, stylistic, sources, for, the, heads, of, the, women, and, their, degree, of, influence, has, been, much, discussed, and, debated, in, particular, the, influence, of, african, tribal, masks, art, of, oceania, and, pre, roman, iberian, sculptures, the, rounded, contours, of, the, features, of, the, three, women, to, the, left, can, be, related, to, iberian, sculpture, but, not, obviously, the, fragmented, planes, of, the, two, on, the, right, which, indeed, seem, influenced, by, african, masks, lawrence, weschler, says, that, in, many, ways, much, of, the, moldering, cultural, and, even, scientific, ferment, that, characterized, the, first, decade, and, a, half, of, the, twentieth, century, and, that, laid, the, foundations, for, much, of, what, we, today, consider, modern, can, be, traced, back, to, ways, in, which, europe, was, already, wrestling, with, its, bad, faith, often, strenuously, repressed, knowledge, of, what, it, had, been, doing, in, africa, the, example, of, picasso, virtually, launching, cubism, with, his, 1907, desmoiselles, d, avignon, in, response, to, the, sorts, of, african, masks, and, other, colonial, booty, he, was, encountering, in, paris, s, musee, de, l, homme, is, obvious, private, collections, and, illustrated, books, featuring, african, art, in, this, period, were, also, important, while, picasso, emphatically, denied, the, influence, of, african, masks, on, the, painting, african, art, never, heard, of, it, l, art, n, gre, connais, pas, this, is, belied, by, his, deep, interest, in, the, african, sculptures, owned, by, matisse, and, his, close, friend, guiliaume, apollinaire, since, none, of, the, african, masks, once, thought, to, have, influenced, picasso, in, this, painting, were, available, in, paris, at, the, time, work, was, painted, he, is, thought, now, to, have, studied, african, mask, forms, in, an, illustrated, volume, by, anthropologist, leo, frobenius, primitivism, continues, in, his, work, during, before, and, after, the, painting, of, les, demoiselles, d, avignon, from, spring, 1906, through, the, spring, of, 1907, influences, from, ancient, iberian, sculpture, are, also, important, some, iberian, reliefs, from, osuna, then, only, recently, excavated, were, on, display, in, the, louvre, from, 1904, archaic, greek, sculpture, has, also, been, claimed, as, an, influence, contentions, about, the, influence, of, african, sculpture, were, fueled, in, 1939, when, alfred, barr, said, the, primitivism, of, the, demoiselles, derived, from, the, art, of, c, te, d, ivoire, and, the, french, congo, picasso, subsequently, insisted, his, catalogue, raissonne, s, editor, christian, zervos, publish, a, disclaimer, in, which, picasso, certified, that, he, was, not, aware, of, african, art, until, after, demoiselles, was, completed, but, that, he, had, instead, drawn, from, iberian, art, he, had, seen, a, year, or, so, earlier, in, particular, from, the, louvre, s, osuna, reliefs, contradictingly, in, 1944, picasso, recounted, seeing, african, art, and, being, greatly, moved, by, it, during, demoiselles, creation, adding, that, the, experience, was, revelatory, and, a, pivotal, moment, in, the, painting, s, formulation, to, andre, malraux, he, said, the, revelations, of, african, sculpture, came, to, him, from, visiting, to, the, ethnographic, museum, of, the, trocadero, as, picasso, recalled, when, i, went, to, the, trocadero, it, was, disgusting, the, flea, market, the, smell, i, was, all, alone, i, wanted, to, get, away, but, i, didn, t, leave, i, stayed, i, stayed, i, understood, that, it, was, very, important, something, was, happening, to, me, right, the, masks, weren, t, like, any, other, pieces, of, sculpture, not, at, all, they, were, magic, things, maurice, de, vlaminck, is, often, credited, with, introducing, picasso, to, african, sculpture, of, fang, extraction, in, 1904, picasso, biographer, john, richardson, recounts, in, a, life, of, picasso, the, cubist, rebel, 1907, 1916, art, dealer, daniel, henry, kahnweiler, s, recollection, of, his, first, visit, to, picasso, s, studio, in, july, 1907, kahnweiler, remembers, seeing, dusty, stacks, of, canvases, in, picasso, s, studio, and, african, sculptures, of, majestic, severity, richardson, comments, so, much, for, picasso, s, story, that, he, was, not, yet, aware, of, tribal, art, a, photograph, of, picasso, in, his, studio, surrounded, by, african, sculptures, c, 1908, is, found, on, page, 27, of, that, same, volume, suzanne, preston, blier, says, that, like, gauguin, and, several, other, artists, in, this, era, picasso, used, illustrated, books, for, many, of, his, preliminary, studies, for, this, painting, in, addition, to, the, frobenius, book, his, sources, included, a, 1906, publication, of, a, twelfth, century, medieval, art, manuscript, on, architectural, sculpture, by, villiard, de, honnecourt, and, a, book, by, carl, heinrich, stratz, of, pseudo, pornography, showing, photos, and, drawings, of, women, from, around, the, world, organized, to, evoke, ideas, of, human, origins, and, evolution, blier, suggests, that, this, helps, account, for, the, diversity, of, styles, picasso, employed, in, his, image, filled, sketchbooks, for, this, painting, these, books, and, other, sources, such, as, cartoons, blier, writes, also, offer, hints, as, to, the, larger, meaning, of, this, painting, maurice, princet, a, french, mathematician, and, actuary, played, a, role, in, the, birth, of, cubism, as, an, associate, of, pablo, picasso, guillaume, apollinaire, max, jacob, jean, metzinger, robert, delaunay, juan, gris, and, later, marcel, duchamp, princet, became, known, as, le, math, maticien, du, cubisme, the, mathematician, of, cubism, princet, is, credited, with, introducing, the, work, of, henri, poincar, and, the, concept, of, the, fourth, dimension, to, artists, at, the, bateau, lavoir, princet, brought, to, the, attention, of, picasso, metzinger, and, others, a, book, by, esprit, jouffret, trait, l, mentaire, de, g, om, trie, quatre, dimensions, elementary, treatise, on, the, geometry, of, four, dimensions, 1903, a, popularization, of, poincar, s, science, and, hypothesis, in, which, jouffret, described, hypercubes, and, other, complex, polyhedra, in, four, dimensions, and, projected, them, onto, the, two, dimensional, surface, picasso, s, sketchbooks, for, les, demoiselles, d, avignon, illustrate, jouffret, s, influence, on, the, artist, s, work, although, les, demoiselles, had, an, enormous, and, profound, influence, on, modern, art, its, impact, was, not, immediate, and, the, painting, stayed, in, picasso, s, studio, for, many, years, at, first, only, picasso, s, intimate, circle, of, artists, dealers, collectors, and, friends, were, aware, of, the, work, soon, after, the, late, summer, of, 1907, picasso, and, his, long, time, lover, fernande, olivier, 1881, 1966, separated, the, re, painting, of, the, two, heads, on, the, far, right, of, les, demoiselles, fueled, speculation, that, it, was, an, indication, of, the, split, between, picasso, and, olivier, although, they, later, reunited, for, a, period, the, relationship, ended, in, 1912, a, photograph, of, the, les, demoiselles, was, first, published, in, an, article, by, gelett, burgess, entitled, the, wild, men, of, paris, matisse, picasso, and, les, fauves, the, architectural, record, may, 1910, les, demoiselles, would, not, be, exhibited, until, 1916, and, not, widely, recognized, as, a, revolutionary, achievement, until, the, early, 1920s, when, andr, breton, 1896, 1966, published, the, work, the, painting, was, reproduced, again, in, cahiers, d, art, 1927, within, an, article, dedicated, to, african, art, richardson, goes, on, to, say, that, matisse, was, irate, upon, seeing, the, demoiselles, at, picasso, s, studio, he, let, it, be, known, that, he, regarded, the, painting, as, an, attempt, to, ridicule, the, modern, movement, he, was, outraged, to, find, his, sensational, blue, nude, not, to, speak, of, bonheur, de, vivre, overtaken, by, picasso, s, hideous, whores, he, vowed, to, get, even, and, make, picasso, beg, for, mercy, just, as, the, bonheur, de, vivre, had, fueled, picasso, s, competitiveness, les, demoiselles, now, fueled, matisse, s, among, picasso, s, closed, circle, of, friends, and, colleagues, there, was, a, mixture, of, opinions, about, les, demoiselles, georges, braque, and, andr, derain, were, both, initially, troubled, by, it, although, they, were, supportive, of, picasso, according, to, william, rubin, two, of, picasso, s, friends, the, art, critic, andr, salmon, and, the, painter, ardengo, soffici, 1879, 1964, were, enthusiastic, about, it, while, guillaume, apollinaire, 1880, 1918, was, not, both, the, art, dealer, collector, wilhelm, uhde, 1874, 1947, and, kahnweiler, were, more, enthusiastic, about, the, painting, however, according, to, kahnweiler, les, demoiselles, was, the, beginning, of, cubism, he, writes, early, in, 1907, picasso, began, a, strange, large, painting, depicting, women, fruit, and, drapery, which, he, left, unfinished, it, cannot, be, called, other, than, unfinished, even, though, it, represents, a, long, period, of, work, begun, in, the, spirit, of, the, works, of, 1906, it, contains, in, one, section, the, endeavors, of, 1907, and, thus, never, constitutes, a, unified, whole, the, nudes, with, large, quiet, eyes, stand, rigid, like, mannequins, their, stiff, round, bodies, are, flesh, colored, black, and, white, that, is, the, style, of, 1906, in, the, foreground, however, alien, to, the, style, of, the, rest, of, the, painting, appear, a, crouching, figure, and, a, bowl, of, fruit, these, forms, are, drawn, angularly, not, roundly, modeled, in, chiaroscuro, the, colors, are, luscious, blue, strident, yellow, next, to, pure, black, and, white, this, is, the, beginning, of, cubism, the, first, upsurge, a, desperate, titanic, clash, with, all, of, the, problems, at, once, from, 16, to, 31, july, 1916, les, demoiselles, was, exhibited, to, the, public, for, the, first, time, at, the, salon, d, antin, an, exhibition, organized, by, andr, salmon, titled, l, art, moderne, en, france, the, exhibition, space, at, 26, rue, d, antin, was, lent, by, the, famous, couturier, and, art, collector, paul, poiret, the, larger, salon, d, automne, and, salon, des, ind, pendants, had, been, closed, due, to, world, war, i, making, this, the, only, cubists, exhibition, in, france, since, 1914, on, 23, july, 1916, a, review, was, published, in, le, cri, de, paris, the, cubists, are, not, waiting, for, the, war, to, end, to, recommence, hostilities, against, good, sense, they, are, exhibiting, at, the, galerie, poiret, naked, women, whose, scattered, parts, are, represented, in, all, four, corners, of, the, canvas, here, an, eye, there, an, ear, over, there, a, hand, a, foot, on, top, a, mouth, below, m, picasso, their, leader, is, possibly, the, least, disheveled, of, the, lot, he, has, painted, or, rather, daubed, five, women, who, are, if, the, truth, be, told, all, hacked, up, and, yet, their, limbs, somehow, manage, to, hold, together, they, have, moreover, piggish, faces, with, eyes, wandering, negligently, above, their, ears, an, enthusiastic, art, lover, offered, the, artist, 20, 000, francs, for, this, masterpiece, m, picasso, wanted, more, the, art, lover, did, not, insist, picasso, referred, to, his, only, entry, at, the, salon, d, antin, as, his, brothel, painting, calling, it, le, bordel, d, avignon, but, andr, salmon, who, had, originally, labeled, the, work, le, bordel, philosophique, retitled, it, les, demoiselles, d, avignon, so, as, to, lessen, its, scandalous, impact, on, the, public, picasso, never, liked, the, title, however, preferring, las, chicas, de, avignon, but, salmon, s, title, stuck, leo, steinberg, labels, his, essays, on, the, painting, after, its, original, title, according, to, suzanne, preston, blier, the, word, bordel, in, the, painting, s, title, rather, than, evoking, a, house, of, prostitution, une, maison, close, instead, more, accurately, references, in, french, a, complex, situation, or, mess, this, painting, blier, says, explores, not, prostitution, per, se, but, instead, sex, and, motherhood, more, generally, along, with, the, complexities, of, evolution, in, the, colonial, multi, racial, world, the, name, avignon, scholars, argue, not, only, references, the, street, where, picasso, once, bought, his, paint, supplies, which, had, a, few, brothels, but, also, the, home, of, max, jacob, s, grandmother, whom, picasso, jocularly, identifies, as, one, of, the, painting, s, diverse, modern, day, subjects, the, only, other, time, the, painting, might, have, been, exhibited, to, the, public, prior, to, a, 1937, showing, in, new, york, was, in, 1918, in, an, exhibition, dedicated, to, picasso, and, matisse, at, galerie, paul, guillaume, in, paris, though, very, little, information, exists, about, this, exhibition, or, the, presence, if, at, all, of, les, demoiselles, afterwards, the, painting, was, rolled, up, and, remained, with, picasso, until, 1924, when, with, urging, and, help, from, breton, and, louis, aragon, 1897, 1982, he, sold, it, to, designer, jacques, doucet, 1853, 1929, for, 25, 000, francs, between, september, 1984, and, january, 1985, les, demoiselles, was, displayed, in, an, exhibition, entitled, primitivism, in, 20th, century, art, affinity, of, the, tribal, and, the, modern, at, the, museum, of, modern, art, in, new, york, city, the, exhibition, displayed, modern, pieces, by, artists, such, as, henri, matisse, paul, gauguin, and, pablo, picasso, alongside, artifacts, from, tribal, groups, from, africa, oceania, and, north, america, in, order, to, reveal, how, modern, artists, have, interpreted, tribal, art, the, display, of, this, painting, among, african, tribal, masks, was, intended, to, correlate, the, masks, as, the, inspiration, for, the, features, picasso, painted, on, the, women, in, les, demoiselles, the, exhibition, s, catalogue, states, that, the, pejorative, ethnographic, and, political, connotations, of, primitivism, were, not, the, lens, of, the, exhibition, s, curation, nevertheless, the, exhibition, was, controversial, as, some, critics, believed, it, exemplified, western, intrigue, with, the, different, and, the, harmful, notion, that, western, culture, is, the, modern, and, ideal, future, the, museum, s, attempt, to, remove, the, implication, of, the, title, s, vocabulary, was, critiqued, as, false, innocence, by, critics, who, said, the, exhibition, framed, tribal, culture, as, foreign, and, different, symbolism, and, treated, tribal, objects, solely, a, part, of, history, whose, only, modern, purpose, is, to, serve, artistic, interpretation, picasso, drew, each, of, the, figures, in, les, demoiselles, differently, the, woman, pulling, the, curtain, on, the, upper, right, is, rendered, with, heavy, paint, composed, of, sharp, geometric, shapes, her, head, is, the, most, strictly, cubist, of, all, five, the, curtain, seems, to, blend, partially, into, her, body, the, cubist, head, of, the, crouching, figure, lower, right, underwent, at, least, two, revisions, from, an, iberian, figure, to, its, current, state, she, also, seems, to, have, been, drawn, from, two, different, perspectives, at, once, creating, a, confusing, twisted, figure, the, woman, above, her, is, rather, manly, with, a, dark, face, and, square, chest, the, whole, picture, is, in, a, two, dimensional, style, with, an, abandoned, perspective, much, of, the, critical, debate, that, has, taken, place, over, the, years, centers, on, attempting, to, account, for, this, multiplicity, of, styles, within, the, work, the, dominant, understanding, for, over, five, decades, espoused, most, notably, by, alfred, barr, the, first, director, of, the, museum, of, modern, art, in, new, york, city, and, organizer, of, major, career, retrospectives, for, the, artist, has, been, that, it, can, be, interpreted, as, evidence, of, a, transitional, period, in, picasso, s, art, an, effort, to, connect, his, earlier, work, to, cubism, the, style, he, would, help, invent, and, develop, over, the, next, five, or, six, years, suzanne, preston, blier, says, that, the, divergent, styles, of, the, painting, were, added, intentionally, to, convey, to, each, women, art, style, attributes, from, the, five, geographic, areas, each, woman, represents, art, critic, john, berger, in, his, controversial, 1965, biography, the, success, and, failure, of, picasso, interprets, les, demoiselles, d, avignon, as, the, provocation, that, led, to, cubism, blunted, by, the, insolence, of, so, much, recent, art, we, probably, tend, to, underestimate, the, brutality, of, the, les, demoiselles, d, avignon, all, his, friends, who, saw, it, in, his, studio, were, at, first, shocked, by, it, and, it, was, meant, to, shock, a, brothel, may, not, in, itself, be, shocking, but, women, painted, without, charm, or, sadness, without, irony, or, social, comment, women, painted, like, the, palings, of, a, stockade, through, eyes, that, look, out, as, if, at, death, that, is, shocking, and, equally, the, method, of, painting, picasso, himself, has, said, that, he, was, influenced, at, the, time, by, archaic, spanish, iberian, sculpture, he, was, also, influenced, particularly, in, the, two, heads, at, the, right, by, african, masks, here, it, seems, that, picasso, s, quotations, are, simple, direct, and, emotional, he, is, not, in, the, least, concerned, with, formal, problems, the, dislocations, in, this, picture, are, the, result, of, aggression, not, aesthetics, it, is, the, nearest, you, can, get, in, a, painting, to, an, outrage, i, emphasize, the, violent, and, iconoclastic, aspect, of, this, painting, because, it, is, usually, enshrined, as, the, great, formal, exercise, which, was, the, starting, point, of, cubism, it, was, the, starting, point, of, cubism, in, so, far, as, it, prompted, braque, to, begin, painting, at, the, end, of, the, year, his, own, far, more, formal, answer, to, les, demoiselles, d, avignon, yet, if, he, had, been, left, to, himself, this, picture, would, never, have, led, picasso, to, cubism, or, to, any, way, of, painting, remotely, resembling, it, it, has, nothing, to, do, with, that, twentieth, century, vision, of, the, future, which, was, the, essence, of, cubism, yet, it, did, provoke, the, beginning, of, the, great, period, of, exception, in, picasso, s, life, nobody, can, know, exactly, how, the, change, began, inside, picasso, we, can, only, note, the, results, les, demoiselles, d, avignon, unlike, any, previous, painting, by, picasso, offers, no, evidence, of, skill, on, the, contrary, it, is, clumsy, overworked, unfinished, it, is, as, though, his, fury, in, painting, it, was, so, great, that, it, destroyed, his, gifts, by, painting, les, demoiselles, d, avignon, picasso, provoked, cubism, it, was, the, spontaneous, and, as, always, primitive, insurrection, out, of, which, for, good, historical, reasons, the, revolution, of, cubism, developed, art, historian, and, professor, anna, c, chave, agrees, with, berger, that, les, demoiselles, d, avignon, can, be, taken, as, the, catalyst, for, the, style, of, cubism, in, her, 1994, article, new, encounters, with, les, desmoiselles, d, avignon, gender, race, and, the, origins, of, cubism, chave, also, gives, an, interesting, new, perspective, on, the, piece, in, her, article, that, of, a, woman, which, stands, in, stark, contrast, to, the, numerous, other, reviews, of, the, painting, provided, by, men, additionally, her, article, focuses, not, only, on, the, work, itself, but, also, on, the, critiques, and, assessments, of, it, that, have, emerged, in, the, decades, since, it, was, initially, displayed, prompting, readers, to, think, deeply, about, what, reactions, to, the, painting, say, about, viewers, and, society, at, large, in, 1972, art, critic, leo, steinberg, in, his, essay, the, philosophical, brothel, posited, a, wholly, different, explanation, for, the, wide, range, of, stylistic, attributes, using, the, earlier, sketches, which, had, been, ignored, by, most, critics, he, argued, that, far, from, evidence, of, an, artist, undergoing, a, rapid, stylistic, metamorphosis, the, variety, of, styles, can, be, read, as, a, deliberate, attempt, a, careful, plan, to, capture, the, gaze, of, the, viewer, he, notes, that, the, five, women, all, seem, eerily, disconnected, indeed, wholly, unaware, of, each, other, rather, they, focus, solely, on, the, viewer, their, divergent, styles, only, furthering, the, intensity, of, their, glare, the, earliest, sketches, feature, two, men, inside, the, brothel, a, sailor, and, a, medical, student, who, was, often, depicted, holding, either, a, book, or, a, skull, causing, barr, and, others, to, read, the, painting, as, a, memento, mori, a, reminder, of, death, a, trace, of, their, presence, at, a, table, in, the, center, remains, the, jutting, edge, of, a, table, near, the, bottom, of, the, canvas, the, viewer, steinberg, says, has, come, to, replace, the, sitting, men, forced, to, confront, the, gaze, of, prostitutes, head, on, invoking, readings, far, more, complex, than, a, simple, allegory, or, the, autobiographical, reading, that, attempts, to, understand, the, work, in, relation, to, picasso, s, own, history, with, women, a, world, of, meanings, then, becomes, possible, suggesting, the, work, as, a, meditation, on, the, danger, of, sex, the, trauma, of, the, gaze, to, use, a, phrase, of, rosalind, krauss, s, invention, and, the, threat, of, violence, inherent, in, the, scene, and, sexual, relations, at, large, according, to, steinberg, the, reversed, gaze, that, is, the, fact, that, the, figures, look, directly, at, the, viewer, as, well, as, the, idea, of, the, self, possessed, woman, no, longer, there, solely, for, the, pleasure, of, the, male, gaze, may, be, traced, back, to, manet, s, olympia, of, 1863, william, rubin, 1927, 2006, the, former, director, of, the, department, of, painting, and, sculpture, at, moma, wrote, that, steinberg, was, the, first, writer, to, come, to, grips, with, the, sexual, subject, of, the, demoiselles, a, few, years, after, writing, the, philosophical, brothel, steinberg, wrote, further, about, the, revolutionary, nature, of, les, demoiselles, picasso, was, resolved, to, undo, the, continuities, of, form, and, field, which, western, art, had, so, long, taken, for, granted, the, famous, stylistic, rupture, at, right, turned, out, to, be, merely, a, consummation, overnight, the, contrived, coherences, of, representational, art, the, feigned, unities, of, time, and, place, the, stylistic, consistencies, all, were, declared, to, be, fictional, the, demoiselles, confessed, itself, a, picture, conceived, in, duration, and, delivered, in, spasms, in, this, one, work, picasso, discovered, that, the, demands, of, discontinuity, could, be, met, on, multiple, levels, by, cleaving, depicted, flesh, by, elision, of, limbs, and, abbreviation, by, slashing, the, web, of, connecting, space, by, abrupt, changes, of, vantage, and, by, a, sudden, stylistic, shift, at, the, climax, finally, the, insistent, staccato, of, the, presentation, was, found, to, intensify, the, picture, s, address, and, symbolic, charge, the, beholder, instead, of, observing, a, roomfui, of, lazing, whores, is, targeted, from, all, sides, so, far, from, suppressing, the, subject, the, mode, of, organization, heightens, its, flagrant, eroticism, at, the, end, of, the, first, volume, of, his, so, far, three, volume, picasso, biography, a, life, of, picasso, the, prodigy, 1881, 1906, john, richardson, comments, on, les, demoiselles, richardson, says, it, is, at, this, point, the, beginning, of, 1907, that, i, propose, to, bring, this, first, volume, to, an, end, the, 25, year, old, picasso, is, about, to, conjure, up, a, quintet, of, dionysiac, demoiselles, on, his, huge, new, canvas, the, execution, of, this, painting, would, make, a, dramatic, climax, to, these, pages, however, it, would, imply, that, picasso, s, great, revolutionary, work, constitutes, a, conclusion, to, all, that, has, gone, before, it, does, not, for, all, that, the, demoiselles, is, rooted, in, picasso, s, past, not, to, speak, of, such, precursors, as, the, iron, age, iberians, el, greco, gauguin, and, c, zanne, it, is, essentially, a, beginning, the, most, innovative, painting, since, giotto, as, we, will, see, in, the, next, volume, it, established, a, new, pictorial, syntax, it, enabled, people, to, perceive, things, with, new, eyes, new, minds, new, awareness, les, demoiselles, d, avignon, is, the, first, unequivocally, 20th, century, masterpiece, a, principal, detonator, of, the, modern, movement, the, cornerstone, of, 20th, century, art, for, picasso, it, would, also, be, a, rite, of, passage, what, he, called, an, exorcism, it, cleared, the, way, for, cubism, it, likewise, banished, the, artist, s, demons, later, these, demons, would, return, and, require, further, exorcism, for, the, next, decade, however, picasso, would, feel, as, free, and, creative, and, as, overworked, as, god, suzanne, preston, blier, addresses, the, history, and, meaning, of, les, demoiselles, d, avignon, in, a, 2019, book, in, a, different, way, one, that, draws, on, her, african, art, expertise, and, an, array, of, newly, discovered, sources, she, unearthed, blier, addresses, the, painting, not, as, a, simple, bordello, scene, but, as, picasso, s, interpretation, of, the, diversity, of, women, from, around, the, world, that, picasso, encountered, in, part, through, photographs, and, sculptures, seen, in, illustrated, books, these, representations, blier, argues, are, central, to, understanding, the, painting, s, creation, and, help, identify, the, demoiselles, as, global, figures, mothers, grandmothers, lovers, and, sisters, living, the, colonial, world, picasso, inhabited, she, says, that, picasso, has, reunited, these, diverse, women, together, in, this, strange, cave, like, and, womb, resembling, setting, as, a, kind, of, global, time, machine, each, woman, referencing, a, different, era, place, of, origins, and, concomitant, artistic, style, as, part, of, the, broader, ages, of, man, theme, important, to, the, new, century, in, which, core, themes, of, evolution, took, on, an, increasingly, important, role, the, two, men, a, sailor, and, a, doctor, depicted, in, some, of, the, painting, s, earlier, preparatory, drawings, blier, suggests, likely, represent, the, male, authors, of, two, of, the, illustrated, books, that, picasso, employed, the, anthropologist, leo, frobenius, as, sailor, one, travels, the, world, to, explore, various, ports, of, call, and, the, vienna, medical, doctor, karl, heinrich, stratz, who, holds, a, human, skull, or, book, consistent, with, the, detailed, anatomical, studies, that, he, provides, blier, is, able, to, date, the, painting, to, late, march, 1907, directly, following, the, opening, of, the, salon, des, independents, where, matisse, and, derain, had, exhibited, their, own, bold, emotionally, charged, origins, themed, tableaux, the, large, scale, of, the, canvas, blier, says, complements, the, important, scientific, and, historical, theme, the, reunion, of, the, mothers, of, each, race, within, this, human, evolutionary, framework, blier, maintains, also, constitutes, the, larger, philosophy, behind, the, painting, s, original, le, bordel, philosophique, title, evoking, the, potent, mess, and, complex, situation, le, bordel, that, picasso, was, exploring, in, this, work, in, contrast, to, leo, steinberg, and, william, rubin, who, argued, that, picasso, had, effaced, the, two, right, hand, demoiselles, to, repaint, their, faces, with, african, masks, in, response, to, a, crisis, stemming, from, larger, fears, of, death, or, women, an, early, photograph, of, the, painting, in, picasso, s, studio, blier, shows, indicates, that, the, artist, had, portrayed, african, masks, on, these, women, from, the, outset, consistent, with, their, identities, as, progenitors, of, these, races, blier, argues, that, the, painting, was, largely, completed, in, a, single, night, following, a, debate, about, philosophy, with, friends, at, a, local, paris, brasserie, jacques, doucet, had, seen, the, painting, at, the, salon, d, antin, yet, remarkably, seems, to, have, purchased, les, demoiselles, without, asking, picasso, to, unroll, it, in, his, studio, so, that, he, could, see, it, again, andr, breton, later, described, the, transaction, i, remember, the, day, he, bought, the, painting, from, picasso, who, strange, as, it, may, seem, appeared, to, be, intimidated, by, doucet, and, even, offered, no, resistance, when, the, price, was, set, at, 25, 000, francs, well, then, it, s, agreed, m, picasso, doucet, then, said, you, shall, receive, 2, 000, francs, per, month, beginning, next, month, until, the, sum, of, 25, 000, francs, is, reached, john, richardson, quotes, breton, in, a, letter, to, doucet, about, les, demoiselles, writing, through, it, one, penetrates, right, into, the, core, of, picasso, s, laboratory, and, because, it, is, the, crux, of, the, drama, the, center, of, all, the, conflicts, that, picasso, has, given, rise, to, and, that, will, last, forever, it, is, a, work, which, to, my, mind, transcends, painting, it, is, the, theater, of, everything, that, has, happened, in, the, last, 50, years, ultimately, it, seems, doucet, paid, 30, 000, francs, rather, than, the, agreed, price, a, few, months, after, the, purchase, doucet, had, the, painting, appraised, at, between, 250, 000, and, 300, 000, francs, richardson, speculates, that, picasso, who, by, 1924, was, on, the, top, of, the, art, world, and, did, not, need, to, sell, the, painting, to, doucet, did, so, and, at, that, low, price, because, doucet, promised, les, demoiselles, would, go, to, the, louvre, in, his, will, however, after, doucet, died, in, 1929, he, did, not, leave, the, painting, to, the, louvre, in, his, will, and, it, was, sold, like, most, of, doucet, s, collection, through, private, dealers, in, november, 1937, the, jacques, seligman, co, art, gallery, in, new, york, city, held, an, exhibition, titled, 20, years, in, the, evolution, of, picasso, 1903, 1923, that, included, les, demoiselles, the, museum, of, modern, art, acquired, the, painting, for, 24, 000, the, museum, raised, 18, 000, toward, the, purchase, price, by, selling, a, degas, painting, and, the, rest, came, from, donations, from, the, co, owners, of, the, gallery, germain, seligman, and, cesar, de, hauke, the, museum, of, modern, art, in, new, york, city, mounted, an, important, picasso, exhibition, on, 15, november, 1939, that, remained, on, view, until, 7, january, 1940, the, exhibition, entitled, picasso, 40, years, of, his, art, was, organized, by, alfred, h, barr, 1902, 1981, in, collaboration, with, the, art, institute, of, chicago, the, exhibition, contained, 344, works, including, the, major, 1937, painting, guernica, and, its, studies, as, well, as, les, demoiselles, in, july, 2007, newsweek, published, a, two, page, article, about, les, demoiselles, d, avignon, describing, it, as, the, most, influential, work, of, art, of, the, last, 100, years, art, critic, holland, cotter, argued, that, picasso, changed, history, with, this, work, he, d, replaced, the, benign, ideal, of, the, classical, nude, with, a, new, race, of, sexually, armed, and, dangerous, beings, the, painting, is, prominently, featured, in, the, 1993, steve, martin, play, picasso, at, the, lapin, agile, about, a, fictional, meeting, of, the, young, picasso, and, albert, einstein, in, a, paris, cafe, and, in, the, 2018, season, of, the, television, series, genius, which, focuses, on, picasso, s, life, and, work, in, 2003, an, examination, of, the, painting, by, x, ray, fluorescence, spectroscopy, performed, by, conservators, at, the, museum, of, modern, art, confirmed, the, presence, of, the, following, pigments, lead, white, bone, black, vermilion, cadmium, yellow, cobalt, blue, emerald,
