peau, de, balle, and, a, script, vigo, had, written, about, the, relationship, between, a, bourgeois, father, and, his, more, progressive, son, in, july, 1933, nounez, finally, gave, vigo, a, scenario, about, barge, dwellers, called, l, atalante, written, by, jean, guin, e, in, the, early, 1930s, films, and, music, about, barge, dwellers, were, popular, in, france, and, had, inspired, such, pop, songs, as, chanson, de, halage, and, le, chaland, qui, passe, vigo, initially, disliked, the, scenario, but, finally, agreed, to, make, the, film, and, began, making, suggestions, for, the, story, nounez, produced, the, film, for, 1, million, and, made, a, deal, with, the, gaumont, film, company, to, provide, studio, sets, and, distribute, the, film, vigo, hired, people, he, frequently, collaborated, with, such, as, cinematographer, boris, kaufman, composer, maurice, jaubert, and, art, director, francis, jourdain, who, was, an, old, friend, of, his, father, boris, kaufman, the, brother, of, soviet, film, maker, dziga, vertov, described, his, years, working, with, vigo, as, cinematic, paradise, vigo, also, hired, established, film, editor, louis, chavance, after, he, found, it, difficult, to, edit, zero, for, conduct, himself, chavance, had, attended, the, premiere, of, zero, for, conduct, and, had, been, one, of, its, early, supporters, and, quickly, became, friends, with, vigo, vigo, and, albert, ri, ra, quickly, wrote, a, shooting, script, and, scouted, locations, at, docks, during, the, summer, of, 1933, they, also, found, and, leased, louise, xvi, the, barge, used, for, the, film, vigo, worked, with, established, movie, stars, for, the, first, time, who, were, hired, by, gaumont, but, approved, of, by, vigo, michel, simon, had, been, a, lead, actor, after, appearing, in, the, title, role, of, jean, renoir, s, boudu, saved, from, drowning, 1932, simon, stated, that, he, accepted, the, role, for, the, little, known, and, already, controversial, vigo, because, he, sympathized, with, vigo, and, wanted, to, help, his, troubled, career, dita, parlo, was, a, minor, star, who, had, just, returned, to, france, after, six, years, in, germany, jean, dast, had, only, appeared, in, zero, for, conduct, and, boudu, saved, from, drowning, before, his, lead, role, but, went, on, to, have, a, long, career, in, france, louis, lef, bvre, had, previously, appeared, in, zero, for, conduct, vigo, was, familiar, with, lef, bvre, s, lack, of, acting, training, and, awkwardness, on, camera, and, worked, those, characteristics, into, his, character, in, order, to, make, lef, bvre, s, performance, work, although, scheduled, to, begin, shooting, during, the, summer, production, did, not, begin, until, mid, november, 1933, l, atalante, took, four, months, to, shoot, partially, in, a, replica, of, the, barge, in, a, gaumont, studio, and, partially, on, location, during, filming, vigo, would, often, act, out, the, scenes, himself, for, the, actors, and, insisted, that, they, re, shoot, scenes, until, they, were, perfect, amongst, the, changes, that, vigo, made, to, the, original, script, was, replacing, p, re, jules, pet, dog, with, over, ten, alley, cats, supplied, by, the, society, for, the, prevention, of, cruelty, to, animals, vigo, s, father, had, been, fond, of, such, cats, and, vigo, s, childhood, homes, were, often, overrun, with, stray, cats, during, the, scenes, where, p, re, jules, plays, his, phonograph, the, cats, would, become, immediately, fascinated, by, the, phonograph, and, surround, it, whenever, it, played, music, vigo, quickly, assembled, his, crew, and, shot, footage, of, the, cats, listening, to, the, music, and, sleeping, inside, the, loud, speaker, simon, later, adopted, the, kitten, that, rested, inside, the, phonograph, horn, vigo, also, visited, local, flea, markets, in, saint, ouen, and, the, scrap, metal, market, on, boulevard, richard, lenoir, to, find, props, for, p, re, jules, collection, of, artifacts, from, around, the, world, production, began, with, the, exteriors, on, location, and, was, shot, mostly, in, sequence, the, first, scene, shot, was, the, wedding, sequence, at, maurecourt, in, the, oise, the, exteriors, of, the, dance, hall, sequence, where, juliette, first, meets, the, showman, were, shot, at, the, charentonneau, dance, hall, in, maisons, alfort, while, the, interiors, were, shot, on, an, elaborate, set, at, gaumont, studios, the, character, of, the, showman, was, not, very, developed, in, the, shooting, script, and, vigo, relied, on, improvisation, on, set, to, create, a, more, interesting, character, because, gaumont, had, insisted, that, music, be, included, in, the, film, the, showman, sings, the, pedlar, s, complaint, a, french, folk, song, written, by, vigo, goldblatt, and, jaubert, that, makes, fun, of, the, genre, of, music, that, they, were, unwillingly, required, to, include, in, the, film, vigo, had, previously, experienced, bad, sound, quality, when, shooting, zero, for, conduct, and, was, concerned, about, a, similar, problem, on, l, atalante, despite, having, better, equipment, since, michel, simon, had, both, the, most, dialogue, in, the, film, and, a, distinctly, inarticulate, manner, of, speech, vigo, had, simon, adopt, the, character, trait, of, repeating, questions, that, were, asked, of, his, character, the, first, two, weeks, of, location, shooting, began, in, the, oise, between, the, marne, and, the, rhine, and, down, the, ourcq, canal, to, the, basin, at, la, villette, the, harsh, and, early, winter, weather, slowed, down, the, shooting, schedule, and, affected, vigo, s, health, despite, the, cold, weather, vigo, wanted, to, shoot, at, night, more, and, more, so, as, to, use, the, artificial, lights, of, the, barge, and, houses, along, the, canal, vigo, also, needed, to, maintain, continuity, and, the, cold, weather, was, creating, floating, ice, in, the, canal, in, the, middle, of, location, shooting, vigo, moved, the, cast, and, crew, to, the, replica, set, of, the, barge, at, gaumont, studios, at, la, villette, but, would, quickly, change, the, day, s, shooting, to, on, location, whenever, the, weather, permitted, vigo, left, all, transition, shots, to, the, very, end, of, shooting, which, became, a, major, problem, due, to, the, ground, then, being, covered, with, snow, vigo, shot, many, low, angle, shots, that, only, showed, the, sky, in, the, background, to, ameliorate, this, problem, by, mid, january, the, film, was, behind, schedule, and, over, budget, with, several, major, sequences, having, not, yet, been, shot, gaumont, executives, blamed, vigo, and, pressured, him, to, finish, the, film, quickly, and, inexpensively, vigo, was, forced, to, film, documentary, style, footage, such, as, the, scene, where, juliette, walks, past, a, line, of, real, unemployed, workers, despite, not, having, sufficient, funding, from, gaumont, to, pay, extras, or, for, locations, he, was, able, to, film, the, scene, where, juliette, is, robbed, at, the, gare, d, austerlitz, in, the, middle, of, the, night, with, a, few, friends, appearing, as, background, extras, chavance, was, also, able, to, recruit, members, of, the, october, group, such, as, jacques, pr, vert, pierre, pr, vert, and, loutchimoukov, to, appear, in, the, film, on, location, shooting, conditions, were, often, cold, and, wet, causing, vigo, to, become, ill, and, develop, a, fever, he, was, already, suffering, from, tuberculosis, and, was, bedridden, for, portions, of, the, filming, vigo, refused, to, take, a, break, and, would, often, fight, with, executives, at, gaumont, over, the, film, he, worked, until, the, film, was, almost, complete, and, a, rough, cut, had, been, made, at, the, end, of, four, months, of, continuous, shooting, in, early, february, 1934, vigo, took, a, vacation, in, villard, de, lans, with, family, and, friends, to, try, to, regain, his, health, he, intended, to, finish, the, final, cut, of, the, film, but, his, condition, became, worse, and, he, returned, to, paris, to, recover, the, few, remaining, aerial, shots, were, done, by, boris, kaufman, while, editor, louis, chavance, finished, the, final, cut, without, vigo, vigo, s, health, did, not, improve, and, was, confined, to, his, bed, for, the, remainder, of, his, life, dast, later, claimed, that, vigo, made, jokes, all, the, time, spending, a, day, with, him, was, wonderful, and, grueling, even, a, few, weeks, before, his, death, he, was, such, a, vivacious, person, the, film, was, previewed, to, french, film, distributors, at, the, palais, rochechouarton, on, 25, april, 1934, the, screening, was, disastrous, and, gaumont, took, control, of, the, film, jean, pascal, called, the, original, cut, a, confused, incoherent, willfully, absurd, long, dull, commercially, worthless, film, however, lie, faure, said, that, he, was, reminded, of, the, painter, jean, baptiste, camille, corot, and, praised, these, landscapes, of, water, trees, little, houses, on, peaceful, banks, and, boats, slowly, threading, their, way, ahead, of, a, silver, wake, the, same, impeccable, composition, the, same, power, invisibly, present, because, so, much, a, master, of, itself, the, same, balance, of, all, the, elements, of, a, visual, drama, in, the, tender, embrace, of, complete, acceptance, the, same, pearly, golden, veil, translucently, masking, the, sharpness, of, composition, and, the, firmness, of, line, and, perhaps, it, was, the, simplicity, of, composition, entirely, devoid, of, flourishes, or, decoration, classical, in, a, word, that, made, me, appreciate, all, the, more, pleasure, of, savoring, the, very, spirit, of, vigo, s, work, almost, violent, certainly, tormented, feverish, brimming, with, ideas, and, truculent, fantasy, with, virulent, even, demonic, and, yet, constantly, human, romanticism, eventually, gaumont, cut, the, film, s, run, time, to, 65, minutes, in, an, attempt, to, make, it, more, popular, and, changed, the, title, to, le, chaland, qui, passe, the, passing, barge, the, name, of, a, popular, song, at, the, time, by, lys, gauty, which, was, also, inserted, into, the, film, replacing, parts, of, jaubert, s, score, vigo, was, too, weak, to, defend, the, film, as, his, condition, grew, worse, when, l, atalante, was, released, in, september, 1934, it, was, a, commercial, failure, and, received, poor, reviews, from, critics, who, called, it, amateurish, self, indulgent, and, morbid, in, october, 1934, shortly, after, the, film, had, finished, its, initial, run, at, french, movie, theaters, vigo, died, at, the, age, of, 29, in, the, arms, of, his, wife, lydou, allegedly, he, died, just, as, a, street, performer, began, playing, le, chaland, qui, passe, below, his, window, l, atalante, and, all, of, vigo, s, work, was, mostly, forgotten, by, the, late, 1930s, despite, l, atalante, being, partially, restored, in, 1940, vigo, s, work, began, to, be, rediscovered, after, world, war, ii, l, atalante, and, zero, for, conduct, were, both, re, released, in, new, york, in, july, 1947, and, received, rave, reviews, from, film, critics, such, as, james, agee, who, called, vigo, one, of, the, very, few, real, originals, who, have, ever, worked, in, film, in, the, uk, roger, manvell, called, vigo, perhaps, the, most, original, and, promising, of, the, great, french, directors, in, italy, luigi, comencini, obtained, a, personal, copy, of, l, atalante, and, would, screen, it, for, his, friends, calling, it, a, masterpiece, capable, of, shaking, up, any, notion, about, cinema, the, average, spectator, might, have, film, critic, georges, sadoul, praised, the, astounding, quality, of, poetry, it, engenders, from, a, world, superficially, ordinary, and, drab, the, film, became, a, favorite, of, the, filmmakers, of, the, french, new, wave, whose, films, contain, many, allusions, to, vigo, s, work, the, french, director, fran, ois, truffaut, fell, in, love, with, it, when, he, saw, it, at, the, age, of, 14, in, 1946, when, i, entered, the, theater, i, didn, t, even, know, who, jean, vigo, was, i, was, immediately, overwhelmed, with, wild, enthusiasm, for, his, work, yugoslavian, film, director, emir, kusturica, has, said, he, is, a, big, admirer, of, vigo, s, work, and, describes, vigo, as, a, poet, this, admiration, is, best, shown, in, kusturica, s, underground, 1995, where, the, underwater, scenes, are, very, reminiscent, of, those, from, l, atalante, other, films, to, pay, tribute, to, l, atalante, include, bernardo, bertolucci, s, last, tango, in, paris, 1972, leos, carax, s, les, amants, du, pont, neuf, 1991, and, jean, luc, godard, s, in, praise, of, love, 2001, l, atalante, was,

british, national, film, and, television, archive, as, well, as, by, rushes, and, rare, material, from, the, french, cinematheque, and, sequences, from, a, copy, of, le, chaland, qui, passe, held, by,
