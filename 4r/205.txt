nineteen, eighty, four, the, notebooks, have, been, deemed, unlikely, to, have, been, completed, later, than, january, 1944, and, there, is, a, strong, suspicion, that, some, of, the, material, in, them, dates, back, to, the, early, part, of, the, war, in, one, 1948, letter, orwell, claims, to, have, first, thought, of, in, 1943, while, in, another, he, says, he, thought, of, it, in, 1944, and, cites, 1943, s, tehran, conference, as, inspiration, what, it, is, really, meant, to, do, is, to, discuss, the, implications, of, dividing, the, world, up, into, zones, of, influence, i, thought, of, it, in, 1944, as, a, result, of, the, tehran, conference, and, in, addition, to, indicate, by, parodying, them, the, intellectual, implications, of, totalitarianism, orwell, had, toured, austria, in, may, 1945, and, observed, manoeuvring, he, thought, would, probably, lead, to, separate, soviet, and, allied, zones, of, occupation, in, january, 1944, literature, professor, gleb, struve, introduced, orwell, to, yevgeny, zamyatin, s, 1924, dystopian, novel, we, in, his, response, orwell, expressed, an, interest, in, the, genre, and, informed, struve, that, he, had, begun, writing, ideas, for, one, of, his, own, that, may, get, written, sooner, or, later, in, 1946, orwell, wrote, about, the, 1931, dystopian, novel, brave, new, world, by, aldous, huxley, in, his, article, freedom, and, happiness, for, the, tribune, and, noted, similarities, to, we, by, this, time, orwell, had, scored, a, critical, and, commercial, hit, with, his, 1945, political, satire, animal, farm, which, raised, his, profile, for, a, follow, up, he, decided, to, produce, a, dystopian, work, of, his, own, in, a, june, 1944, meeting, with, fredric, warburg, co, founder, of, his, british, publisher, secker, warburg, shortly, before, the, release, of, animal, farm, orwell, announced, that, he, had, written, the, first, 12, pages, of, his, new, novel, he, could, only, earn, a, living, from, journalism, however, and, predicted, the, book, would, not, see, a, release, before, 1947, progress, was, slow, by, the, end, of, september, 1945, orwell, had, written, some, 50, pages, orwell, became, disenchanted, with, the, restrictions, and, pressures, involved, with, journalism, and, grew, to, detest, city, life, in, london, he, suffered, from, bronchiectasis, and, a, lesion, in, one, lung, the, harsh, winter, worsened, his, health, in, may, 1946, orwell, arrived, on, the, scottish, island, of, jura, he, had, wanted, to, retreat, to, a, hebridean, island, for, several, years, david, astor, recommended, he, stay, at, barnhill, a, remote, farmhouse, on, the, island, that, his, family, owned, with, no, electricity, or, hot, water, here, orwell, intermittently, drafted, and, finished, nineteen, eighty, four, his, first, stay, lasted, until, october, 1946, during, which, time, he, made, little, progress, on, the, few, already, completed, pages, and, at, one, point, did, no, work, on, it, for, three, months, after, spending, the, winter, in, london, orwell, returned, to, jura, in, may, 1947, he, reported, to, warburg, that, despite, progress, being, slow, and, difficult, he, was, roughly, a, third, of, the, way, through, he, sent, his, ghastly, mess, of, a, first, draft, manuscript, to, london, where, miranda, christen, volunteered, to, type, a, clean, version, orwell, s, health, worsened, further, in, september, however, and, he, was, confined, to, bed, with, inflammation, of, the, lungs, he, lost, almost, two, stone, 28, pounds, or, 12, 7, kg, in, weight, and, had, recurring, night, sweats, but, he, decided, not, to, see, a, doctor, and, continued, writing, on, 7, november, 1947, he, completed, the, first, draft, in, bed, and, subsequently, travelled, to, east, kilbride, near, glasgow, for, medical, treatment, at, hairmyres, hospital, where, a, specialist, confirmed, a, chronic, and, infectious, case, of, tuberculosis, orwell, was, discharged, in, the, summer, of, 1948, after, which, he, returned, to, jura, and, produced, a, full, second, draft, of, nineteen, eighty, four, which, he, finished, in, november, he, asked, warburg, to, have, someone, come, to, barnhill, and, retype, the, manuscript, which, was, so, untidy, that, the, task, was, only, considered, possible, if, orwell, was, present, as, only, he, could, understand, it, the, previous, volunteer, had, left, the, country, and, no, other, could, be, found, at, short, notice, so, an, impatient, orwell, retyped, it, himself, at, a, rate, of, roughly, 4, 000, words, a, day, during, bouts, of, fever, and, bloody, coughing, fits, on, 4, december, 1948, orwell, sent, the, finished, manuscript, to, secker, warburg, and, left, barnhill, for, good, in, january, 1949, he, recovered, at, a, sanitarium, in, the, cotswolds, shortly, before, completion, of, the, second, draft, orwell, hesitated, between, two, titles, for, the, novel, the, last, man, in, europe, an, early, title, and, nineteen, eighty, four, warburg, suggested, the, latter, which, he, took, to, be, a, more, commercially, viable, choice, there, has, been, a, theory, doubted, by, dorian, lynskey, author, of, a, 2019, book, about, nineteen, eighty, four, that, 1984, was, chosen, simply, as, an, inversion, of, the, year, 1948, the, year, in, which, it, was, being, completed, lynskey, says, the, idea, was, first, suggested, by, orwell, s, us, publisher, and, it, was, also, mentioned, by, christopher, hitchens, in, his, introduction, to, the, 2003, edition, of, animal, farm, and, 1984, which, also, notes, that, the, date, was, meant, to, give, an, immediacy, and, urgency, to, the, menace, of, totalitarian, rule, however, lynskey, does, not, believe, the, inversion, theory, this, idea, seems, far, too, cute, for, such, a, serious, book, scholars, have, raised, other, possibilities, eileen, wrote, a, poem, for, her, old, school, s, centenary, called, end, of, the, century, 1984, g, k, chesterton, s, 1904, political, satire, the, napoleon, of, notting, hill, which, mocks, the, art, of, prophecy, opens, in, 1984, the, year, is, also, a, significant, date, in, the, iron, heel, but, all, of, these, connections, are, exposed, as, no, more, than, coincidences, by, the, early, drafts, of, the, novel, first, he, wrote, 1980, then, 1982, and, only, later, 1984, the, most, fateful, date, in, literature, was, a, late, amendment, in, the, run, up, to, publication, orwell, called, the, novel, a, beastly, book, and, expressed, some, disappointment, towards, it, thinking, it, would, have, been, improved, had, he, not, been, so, ill, this, was, typical, of, orwell, who, had, talked, down, his, other, books, shortly, before, their, release, nevertheless, the, book, was, enthusiastically, received, by, secker, warburg, who, acted, quickly, before, orwell, had, left, jura, he, rejected, their, proposed, blurb, that, portrayed, it, as, a, thriller, mixed, up, with, a, love, story, he, also, refused, a, proposal, from, the, american, book, of, the, month, club, to, release, an, edition, without, the, appendix, and, chapter, on, goldstein, s, book, a, decision, which, warburg, claimed, cut, off, about, 40, 000, in, sales, nineteen, eighty, four, was, published, on, 8, june, 1949, in, the, uk, orwell, predicted, earnings, of, around, 500, a, first, print, of, 25, 575, copies, was, followed, by, a, further, 5, 000, copies, in, march, and, august, 1950, the, novel, had, the, most, immediate, impact, in, the, us, following, its, release, there, on, 13, june, 1949, by, harcourt, brace, co, an, initial, print, of, 20, 000, copies, was, quickly, followed, by, another, 10, 000, on, 1, july, and, again, on, 7, september, by, 1970, over, 8, million, copies,

leader, big, brother, who, has, an, intense, cult, of, personality, the, party, brutally, purges, out, anyone, who, does, not, fully, conform, to, their, regime, using, the, thought, police, and,

conform, to, the, state, s, ever, changing, version, of, history, winston, revises, past, editions, of, the, times, while, the, original, documents, are, destroyed, after, being, dropped, into, ducts, known, as, memory, holes, which, lead, to, an, immense, furnace, he, secretly, opposes, the, party, s, rule, and, dreams, of, rebellion, despite, knowing, that, he, is, already, a, thought, criminal, and, is, likely, to, be, caught, one, day, while, in, a, prole, neighbourhood, he, meets, mr, charrington, the, owner, of, an, antiques, shop, and, buys, a, diary, where, he, writes, criticisms, of, the, party, and, big, brother, to, his, dismay, when, he, visits, a, prole, quarter, he, discovers, they, have, no, political, consciousness, as, he, works, in, the, ministry, of, truth, he, observes, julia, a, young, woman, maintaining, the, novel, writing, machines, at, the, ministry, whom, winston, suspects, of, being, a, spy, and, develops, an, intense, hatred, of, her, he, vaguely, suspects, that, his, superior, inner, party, official, o, brien, is, part, of, an, enigmatic, underground, resistance, movement, known, as, the, brotherhood, formed, by, big, brother, s, reviled, political, rival, emmanuel, goldstein, one, day, julia, secretly, hands, winston, a, love, note, and, the, two, begin, a, secret, affair, julia, explains, that, she, also, loathes, the, party, but, winston, observes, that, she, is, politically, apathetic, and, uninterested, in, overthrowing, the, regime, initially, meeting, in, the, country, they, later, meet, in, a, rented, room, above, mr, charrington, s, shop, during, the, affair, winston, remembers, the, disappearance, of, his, family, during, the, civil, war, of, the, 1950s, and, his, tense, relationship, with, his, estranged, wife, katharine, weeks, later, o, brien, invites, winston, to, his, flat, where, he, introduces, himself, as, a, member, of, the, brotherhood, and, sends, winston, a, copy, of, the, theory, and, practice, of, oligarchical, collectivism, by, goldstein, meanwhile, during, the, nation, s, hate, week, oceania, s, enemy, suddenly, changes, from, eurasia, to, eastasia, which, goes, mostly, unnoticed, winston, is, recalled, to, the, ministry, to, help, make, the, necessary, revisions, to, the, records, winston, and, julia, read, parts, of, goldstein, s, book, which, explains, how, the, party, maintains, power, the, true, meanings, of, its, slogans, and, the, concept, of, perpetual, war, it, argues, that, the, party, can, be, overthrown, if, proles, rise, up, against, it, however, winston, never, gets, the, opportunity, to, read, the, chapter, that, explains, why, the, party, took, power, and, is, motivated, to, maintain, it, winston, and, julia, are, captured, when, mr, charrington, is, revealed, to, be, an, undercover, thought, police, agent, and, they, are, separated, and, imprisoned, at, the, ministry, of, love, o, brien, also, reveals, himself, to, be, a, member, of, the, thought, police, and, a, member, of, a, false, flag, operation, which, catches, political, dissidents, of, the, party, over, several, months, winston, is, starved, and, relentlessly, tortured, to, bring, his, beliefs, in, line, with, the, party, o, brien, tells, winston, that, he, will, never, know, whether, the, brotherhood, actually, exists, and, that, goldstein, s, book, was, written, collaboratively, by, him, and, other, party, members, furthermore, o, brien, reveals, to, winston, that, the, party, sees, power, not, as, a, means, but, as, an, end, and, the, ultimate, purpose, of, the, party, is, seeking, power, entirely, for, its, own, sake, for, the, final, stage, of, re, education, o, brien, takes, winston, to, room, 101, which, contains, each, prisoner, s, worst, fear, when, confronted, with, rats, winston, denounces, julia, and, pledges, allegiance, to, the, party, winston, is, released, into, public, life, and, continues, to, frequent, the, chestnut, tree, caf, he, encounters, julia, and, both, reveal, that, they, have, betrayed, the, other, and, are, no, longer, in, love, back, in, the, caf, a, news, alert, celebrates, oceania, s, supposed, massive, victory, over, eurasian, armies, in, africa, winston, finally, accepts, that, he, loves, big, brother, winston, smith, s, memories, and, his, reading, of, the, proscribed, book, the, theory, and, practice, of, oligarchical, collectivism, by, emmanuel, goldstein, reveal, that, after, the, second, world, war, a, third, world, war, broke, out, in, the, early, 1950s, in, which, nuclear, weapons, destroyed, hundreds, of, cities, in, europe, western, russia, and, north, america, though, not, stated, it, is, implied, this, was, a, nuclear, exchange, between, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, colchester, was, destroyed, and, london, also, suffered, widespread, aerial, raids, leading, winston, s, family, to, take, refuge, in, a, london, underground, station, during, the, war, the, soviet, union, invaded, and, absorbed, all, of, continental, europe, while, the, united, states, absorbed, the, british, commonwealth, and, later, latin, america, this, formed, the, basis, of, eurasia, and, oceania, respectively, due, to, the, instability, perpetuated, by, the, nuclear, war, these, new, nations, fell, into, civil, war, but, who, fought, whom, is, left, unclear, there, is, a, reference, to, the, child, winston, having, seen, rival, militias, in, the, streets, each, one, having, a, shirt, of, a, distinct, colour, for, its, members, meanwhile, eastasia, the, last, superstate, established, emerged, only, after, a, decade, of, confused, fighting, it, includes, the, asian, lands, conquered, by, china, and, japan, although, eastasia, is, prevented, from, matching, eurasia, s, size, its, larger, populace, compensates, for, that, handicap, however, due, to, the, fact, that, winston, only, barely, remembers, these, events, as, well, as, the, party, s, constant, manipulation, of, historical, records, the, continuity, and, accuracy, of, these, events, are, unknown, and, exactly, how, the, superstates, ruling, parties, managed, to, gain, their, power, is, also, left, unclear, if, the, official, account, was, accurate, smith, s, strengthening, memories, and, the, story, of, his, family, s, dissolution, suggest, that, the, atomic, bombings, occurred, first, followed, by, civil, war, featuring, confused, street, fighting, in, london, itself, and, the, societal, postwar, reorganisation, which, the, party, retrospectively, calls, the, revolution, it, is, very, difficult, to, trace, the, exact, chronology, but, most, of, the, global, societal, reorganisation, occurred, between, 1945, and, the, early, 1960s, in, 1984, there, is, a, perpetual, war, between, oceania, eurasia, and, eastasia, the, superstates, that, emerged, from, the, global, atomic, war, the, theory, and, practice, of, oligarchical, collectivism, by, emmanuel, goldstein, explains, that, each, state, is, so, strong, that, it, cannot, be, defeated, even, with, the, combined, forces, of, two, superstates, despite, changing, alliances, to, hide, such, contradictions, the, superstates, governments, rewrite, history, to, explain, that, the, new, alliance, always, was, so, the, populaces, are, already, accustomed, to, doublethink, and, accept, it, the, war, is, not, fought, in, oceanian, eurasian, or, eastasian, territory, but, in, the, arctic, wastes, and, a, disputed, zone, roughly, situated, in, between, tangiers, brazzaville, darwin, and, hong, kong, at, the, start, oceania, and, eastasia, are, allies, fighting, eurasia, in, northern, africa, and, the, malabar, coast, that, alliance, ends, and, oceania, allied, with, eurasia, fights, eastasia, a, change, occurring, on, hate, week, dedicated, to, creating, patriotic, fervour, for, the, party, s, perpetual, war, the, public, are, blind, to, the, change, in, mid, sentence, an, orator, changes, the, name, of, the, enemy, from, eurasia, to, eastasia, without, pause, when, the, public, are, enraged, at, noticing, that, the, wrong, flags, and, posters, are, displayed, they, tear, them, down, the, party, later, claims, to, have, captured, the, whole, of, africa, goldstein, s, book, explains, that, the, purpose, of, the, unwinnable, perpetual, war, is, to, consume, human, labour, and, commodities, so, that, the, economy, of, a, superstate, cannot, support, economic, equality, with, a, high, standard, of, life, for, every, citizen, by, using, up, most, of, the, produced, goods, the, proles, are, kept, poor, and, uneducated, and, the, party, hopes, that, they, will, neither, realise, what, the, government, is, doing, nor, rebel, goldstein, also, details, an, oceanian, strategy, of, attacking, enemy, cities, with, atomic, rockets, before, invasion, but, dismisses, it, as, unfeasible, and, contrary, to, the, war, s, purpose, despite, the, atomic, bombing, of, cities, in, the, 1950s, the, superstates, stopped, it, for, fear, that, it, would, imbalance, the, powers, the, military, technology, in, the, novel, differs, little, from, that, of, world, war, ii, but, strategic, bomber, aeroplanes, are, replaced, with, rocket, bombs, helicopters, were, heavily, used, as, weapons, of, war, they, were, very, minor, in, world, war, ii, and, surface, combat, units, have, been, all, but, replaced, by, immense, and, unsinkable, floating, fortresses, island, like, contraptions, concentrating, the, firepower, of, a, whole, naval, task, force, in, a, single, semi, mobile, platform, in,

however, despite, their, insulation, and, overt, privileges, the, upper, class, are, still, not, exempt, from, the, government, s, brutal, restriction, of, thought, and, behaviour, even, while, lies,

are, very, low, they, lack, telescreens, in, their, own, homes, the, book, indicates, that, because, the, middle, class, not, the, lower, class, traditionally, starts, revolutions, the, model, demands, tight, control, of, the, middle, class, with, ambitious, outer, party, members, neutralised, via, promotion, to, the, inner, party, or, reintegration, by, the, ministry, of, love, and,

regularly, reporting, increased, boot, production, more, than, half, of, the, oceanian, populace, goes, barefoot, the, party, claims, that, poverty, is, a, necessary, sacrifice, for, the, war, effort, and, the, book, confirms, that, to, be, partially, correct, since, the, purpose, of, perpetual, war, is, to, consume, surplus, industrial, production, as, the, book, explains, society, is, in, fact,

concepts, and, plot, of, nineteen, eighty, four, have, appeared, frequently, in, other, works, especially, in, popular, music, and, video, entertainment, an, example, is, the, worldwide, hit, reality,

in, the, us, until, 95, years, after, publication, or, 2044, in, october, 1949, after, reading, nineteen, eighty, four, huxley, sent, a, letter, to, orwell, in, which, he, argued, that, it, would, be, more, efficient, for, rulers, to, stay, in, power, by, the, softer, touch, by, allowing, citizens, to, seek, pleasure, to, control, them, rather, than, use, brute, force, he, wrote, whether, in, actual, fact, the, policy, of, the, boot, on, the, face, can, go, on, indefinitely, seems, doubtful, my, own, belief, is, that, the, ruling, oligarchy, will, find, less, arduous, and, wasteful, ways, of, governing, and, of, satisfying, its, lust, for, power, and, these, ways, will, resemble, those, which, i, described, in, brave, new, world, within, the, next, generation, i, believe, that, the, world, s, rulers, will, discover, that, infant, conditioning, and, narco, hypnosis, are, more, efficient, as, instruments, of, government, than, clubs, and, prisons, and, that, the, lust, for, power, can, be, just, as, completely, satisfied, by, suggesting, people, into, loving, their, servitude, as, by, flogging, and, kicking, them, into, obedience, in, the, decades, since, the, publication, of, nineteen, eighty, four, there, have, been, numerous, comparisons, to, huxley, s, brave, new, world, which, had, been, published, 17, years, earlier, in, 1932, they, are, both, predictions, of, societies, dominated, by, a, central, government, and, are, both, based, on, extensions, of, the, trends, of, their, times, however, members, of, the, ruling, class, of, nineteen, eighty, four, use, brutal, force, torture, and, harsh, mind, control, to, keep, individuals, in, line, while, rulers, in, brave, new, world, keep, the, citizens, in, line, by, drugs, hypnosis, genetic, conditioning, and, pleasurable, distractions, regarding, censorship, in, nineteen, eighty, four, the, government, tightly, controls, information, to, keep, the, population, in, line, but, in, huxley, s, world, so, much, information, is, published, that, readers, are, easily, distracted, and, overlook, the, information, that, is, relevant, elements, of, both, novels, can, be, seen, in, modern, day, societies, with, huxley, s, vision, being, more, dominant, in, the, west, and, orwell, s, vision, more, prevalent, with, dictatorships, including, those, in, communist, countries, such, as, in, modern, day, china, and, north, korea, as, is, pointed, out, in, essays, that, compare, the, two, novels, including, huxley, s, own, brave, new, world, revisited, comparisons, with, later, dystopian, novels, like, the, handmaid, s, tale, virtual, light, the, private, eye, and, the, children, of, men, have, also, been, drawn
