abrupt, and, unannounced, changes, of, narrator, location, and, time, conjuring, a, vast, and, dissonant, range, of, cultures, and, literatures, it, employs, many, allusions, to, the, western, canon, ovid, s, metamorphoses, the, legend, of, the, fisher, king, dante, s, divine, comedy, chaucer, s, canterbury, tales, and, even, a, contemporary, popular, song, that, shakespearian, rag, the, poem, is,

narrations, in, which, vignettes, of, several, characters, display, the, fundamental, emptiness, of, their, lives, the, fire, sermon, offers, a, philosophical, meditation, in, relation, to, self, denial, and, sexual, dissatisfaction, death, by, water, is, a, brief, description, of, a, drowned, merchant, and, what, the, thunder, said, is, a, culmination, of, the, poem, s, previously, exposited, themes, explored, through, a, description, of, a, desert, journey, upon, its, initial, publication, the, waste, land, received, a, mixed, response, with, some, critics, finding, it, wilfully, obscure, while, others, praised, its, originality, subsequent, years, saw, the, poem, become, established, as, a, central, work, in, the, modernist, canon, and, it, proved, to, become, one, of, the, most, influential, works, of, the, century, while, at, harvard, college, eliot, met, emily, hale, the, daughter, of, a, minister, at, harvard, divinity, school, through, family, friends, he, declared, his, love, for, her, before, leaving, to, live, in, europe, in, 1914, but, he, did, not, believe, his, feelings, to, be, reciprocated, her, influence, is, felt, in, the, waste, land, and, he, would, renew, his, correspondence, with, her, in, 1927, eliot, married, his, first, wife, vivienne, haigh, wood, in, 1915, having, been, introduced, to, her, earlier, that, year, by, scofield, thayer, she, had, a, history, of, mental, illness, and, it, is, not, clear, to, what, extent, eliot, knew, about, this, before, the, wedding, the, marriage, had, a, shaky, start, eliot, appears, to, have, had, certain, neuroses, concerning, sex, and, sexuality, perhaps, evinced, by, the, women, featured, in, his, poetry, and, there, is, speculation, that, the, two, were, not, sexually, compatible, in, late, 1915, vivienne, began, to, suffer, from, nerves, or, acute, neuralgia, an, illness, which, undoubtedly, bore, a, mental, component, their, friend, bertrand, russell, took, her, to, the, seaside, town, of, torquay, to, recuperate, eliot, took, russell, s, place, after, a, week, and, the, couple, walked, the, shore, which, eliot, found, tranquil, once, back, in, london, vivienne, was, left, bored, and, unoccupied, while, eliot, worked, fourteen, or, fifteen, hours, a, day, and, in, 1918, had, a, brief, affair, with, russell, it, is, not, known, if, eliot, was, aware, of, this, eliot, himself, under, strain, from, his, heavy, workload, concern, about, his, father, s, health, and, the, stress, of, the, ongoing, war, was, also, suffering, from, poor, health, to, the, extent, that, his, doctor, had, ordered, him, not, to, write, prose, for, six, months, in, the, succeeding, years, both, experienced, periods, of, depression, with, eliot, being, constantly, exhausted, and, vivienne, experiencing, migraines, 1921, saw, eliot, be, diagnosed, with, a, nervous, disorder, and, prescribed, three, months, of, rest, a, period, that, precipitated, the, writing, of, the, waste, land, eliot, had, worked, as, a, schoolteacher, from, 1915, to, 1916, resigning, to, make, a, living, from, lecturing, and, literary, reviews, he, was, obliged, however, to, take, a, job, at, lloyds, bank, in, march, 1917, earning, a, salary, of, 270, in, 1918, for, a, role, interpreting, the, balance, sheets, of, foreign, banks, he, would, work, at, the, bank, for, the, next, nine, years, he, began, to, work, as, an, assistant, editor, of, literary, magazine, the, egoist, on, the, side, his, salary, of, 9, per, quarter, partly, financed, by, john, quinn, ezra, pound, s, patron, eliot, also, began, to, write, on, a, freelance, basis, for, the, athenaeum, and, the, times, literary, supplement, in, 1919, which, built, his, reputation, as, a, respected, critic, and, journalist, while, living, in, london, eliot, became, acquainted, with, literary, figures, most, notably, pound, in, 1914, who, would, help, publish, eliot, s, work, and, edit, the, waste, land, eliot, also, met, aldous, huxley, and, katherine, mansfield, as, well, as, members, of, the, bloomsbury, group, in, london, in, 1916, although, he, did, not, meet, leonard, and, virginia, woolf, until, two, years, later, eliot, s, first, collection, prufrock, and, other, observations, was, published, in, 1917, thanks, to, the, efforts, of, pound, publishers, were, not, confident, in, its, success, and, it, was, published, by, harriet, shaw, weaver, of, the, egoist, only, with, funding, provided, by, pound, s, wife, dorothy, although, eliot, was, unaware, of, this, arrangement, it, generated, very, little, interest, until, after, the, publication, of, the, waste, land, and, did, not, sell, its, initial, run, of, 500, copies, until, 1922, poems, was, published, in, 1919, by, the, woolfs, hogarth, press, again, having, been, turned, down, by, several, other, publishers, by, 1920, eliot, had, established, himself, as, a, reputed, critic, and, the, publication, of, ara, vos, prec, and, the, us, publication, of, poems, generated, notable, press, coverage, his, 1920, collection, of, essays, the, sacred, wood, met, with, mixed, reviews, and, eliot, felt, it, should, have, been, revised, further, eliot, probably, worked, on, the, text, that, became, the, waste, land, for, several, years, preceding, its, first, publication, in, 1922, in, 1919, he, referred, to, a, long, poem, i, have, had, on, my, mind, for, a, long, time, in, a, letter, to, his, mother, in, a, may, 1921, letter, to, new, york, lawyer, and, art, patron, john, quinn, eliot, wrote, that, he, had, a, long, poem, in, mind, and, partly, on, paper, which, i, am, wishful, to, finish, richard, aldington, in, his, memoirs, relates, that, a, year, or, so, before, eliot, read, him, the, manuscript, draft, of, the, waste, land, in, london, eliot, visited, him, in, the, country, while, walking, through, a, graveyard, they, discussed, thomas, gray, s, elegy, written, in, a, country, churchyard, aldington, writes, i, was, surprised, to, find, that, eliot, admired, something, so, popular, and, then, went, on, to, say, that, if, a, contemporary, poet, conscious, of, his, limitations, as, gray, evidently, was, would, concentrate, all, his, gifts, on, one, such, poem, he, might, achieve, a, similar, success, in, the, autumn, of, 1921, eliot, and, vivienne, travelled, to, the, coastal, resort, of, margate, eliot, had, been, recommended, rest, following, a, diagnosis, of, some, form, of, nervous, disorder, and, had, been, granted, three, months, leave, from, the, bank, where, he, was, employed, so, the, trip, was, intended, as, a, period, of, convalescence, eliot, worked, on, what, would, become, the, waste, land, while, sitting, in, the, nayland, rock, shelter, on, margate, sands, producing, some, 50, lines, and, the, area, is, referenced, directly, in, the, fire, sermon, on, margate, sands, i, can, connect, nothing, with, nothing, the, couple, travelled, to, paris, in, november, where, eliot, showed, an, early, version, of, the, poem, to, pound, pound, had, become, acquainted, with, eliot, seven, years, previously, and, had, helped, get, some, of, eliot, s, previous, work, published, eliot, was, travelling, on, to, lausanne, for, treatment, by, dr, roger, vittoz, who, had, been, recommended, to, him, by, ottoline, morrell, vivienne, was, to, stay, at, a, sanatorium, just, outside, paris, while, under, vittoz, s, care, eliot, completed, the, first, draft, of, the, waste, land, eliot, returned, from, switzerland, to, paris, in, early, january, 1922, with, the, 19, page, draft, version, of, the, poem, his, treatment, with, dr, vittoz, proved, to, have, been, very, successful, at, least, in, the, short, term, eliot, and, pound, proceeded, to, edit, the, poem, further, continuing, after, eliot, returned, to, london, the, editing, process, removed, a, large, amount, of, content, eliot, allowed, pound, a, high, degree, of, control, over, the, shape, and, contents, of, the, final, version, deferring, to, his, judgement, on, matters, such, as, using, eliot, s, previous, poem, gerontion, as, a, prelude, or, using, an, excerpt, from, the, death, of, kurtz, in, conrad, s, heart, of, darkness, as, the, epigraph, pound, rejected, both, of, these, ideas, biographer, peter, ackroyd, considers, pound, s, focus, to, have, been, on, the, underlying, rhythm, of, the, poem, pound, heard, the, music, and, cut, away, what, was, for, him, the, extraneous, material, which, was, attached, to, it, by, removing, much, of, eliot, s, material, pound, allowed, for, readers, to, more, freely, interpret, it, as, a, less, structured, and, didactic, work, and, his, edits, are, generally, considered, to, have, been, beneficial, vivienne, also, reviewed, drafts, of, the, waste, land, the, section, a, game, of, chess, partly, depicts, scenes, from, the, eliots, marriage, although, at, her, request, a, specific, line, was, removed, the, ivory, men, make, company, between, us, perhaps, because, she, found, the, depiction, of, their, unhappy, marriage, too, painful, in, 1960, thirteen, years, after, vivienne, s, death, eliot, inserted, the, line, from, memory, into, a, fair, copy, made, for, sale, to, aid, the, london, library, in, a, late, december, 1921, letter, to, eliot, to, celebrate, the, birth, of, the, poem, pound, wrote, a, bawdy, poem, of, 48, lines, entitled, sage, homme, in, which, he, identified, eliot, as, the, mother, of, the, poem, but, compared, himself, to, the, midwife, the, first, lines, are, these, are, the, poems, of, eliot, by, the, uranian, muse, begot, a, man, their, mother, was, a, muse, their, sire, how, did, the, printed, infancies, result, from, nuptials, thus, doubly, difficult, if, you, must, needs, enquire, know, diligent, reader, that, on, each, occasion, ezra, performed, the, caesarean, operation, negotiations, over, the, publication, of, the, waste, land, started, in, january, 1922, and, lasted, until, the, late, summer, horace, liveright, of, the, new, york, publishing, firm, of, boni, liveright, had, a, number, of, meetings, with, pound, while, in, paris, and, at, a, dinner, on, 3, january, 1922, with, pound, eliot, and, james, joyce, he, made, offers, for, the, waste, land, ulysses, and, works, by, pound, eliot, was, to, receive, a, royalty, of, 15, for, a, book, version, of, the, poem, planned, for, autumn, publication, although, liveright, was, concerned, that, the, work, was, too, short, eliot, was, still, under, contract, with, his, previous, publisher, alfred, knopf, which, gave, knopf, the, rights, to, eliot, s, next, two, books, but, in, april, eliot, managed, to, secure, a, release, from, that, agreement, eliot, also, sought, a, deal, with, magazines, he, had, become, friends, with, scofield, thayer, editor, of, literary, magazine, the, dial, while, at, milton, academy, and, harvard, college, and, eliot, had, offered, the, poem, to, thayer, for, publication, shortly, after, returning, from, lausanne, in, january, even, though, the, dial, offered, 150, approx, 30, 35, for, the, poem, 25, more, than, its, standard, rate, eliot, was, offended, that, a, year, s, work, would, be, valued, so, low, especially, since, he, knew, that, george, moore, had, been, paid, 100, for, a, short, story, the, deal, with, the, dial, almost, fell, through, other, magazines, considered, were, the, little, review, and, vanity, fair, but, with, quinn, s, efforts, eventually, an, agreement, was, reached, where, in, addition, to, the, 150, eliot, would, be, awarded, the, dial, s, second, annual, prize, for, outstanding, service, to, letters, which, carried, an, award, of, 2, 000, in, new, york, in, late, summer, boni, liveright, made, an, agreement, with, the, dial, allowing, the, magazine, to, be, the, first, to, publish, the, poem, in, the, us, on, the, condition, that, they, purchase, 350, copies, of, the, book, at, discount, increasing, the, cost, to, the, dial, by, 315, eliot, suggested, that, the, possibility, of, the, book, s, getting, the, prize, might, allow, boni, liveright, to, use, the, publicity, increase, their, initial, sales, the, poem, was, first, published, in, the, uk, in, the, first, issue, 16, october, 1922, of, eliot, s, magazine, the, criterion, and, in, the, us, in, the, november, issue, of, the, dial, actually, published, around, 20, october, eliot, had, initially, suggested, spreading, the, poem, over, four, issues, of, the, dial, having, doubts, about, its, coherence, as, a, single, piece, and, had, considered, publishing, it, across, two, issues, of, the, criterion, in, order, to, improve, sales, but, pound, objected, in, december, the, boni, liveright, book, edition, was, published, in, the, us, with, an, initial, run, of, 1, 000, copies, and, very, soon, afterwards, a, second, edition, also, of, 1, 000, copies, the, first, book, edition, was, the, first, publication, to, print, eliot, s, accompanying, notes, which, he, had, added, to, pad, the, piece, out, and, thereby, address, liveright, s, concerns, about, its, length, in, september, 1923, the, hogarth, press, a, private, press, run, by, eliot, s, friends, leonard, and, virginia, woolf, published, the, first, uk, book, edition, of, the, waste, land, in, a, run, of, approximately, 460, copies, eliot, whose, 1922, annual, salary, at, lloyds, bank, was, 500, 2, 215, made, approximately, 630, 2, 800, with, the, dial, boni, liveright, and, hogarth, press, publications, eliot, sent, the, original, manuscript, drafts, of, the, poem, as, a, gift, to, john, quinn, believing, it, to, be, worthwhile, to, preserve, the, effects, of, pound, s, editing, they, arrived, in, new, york, in, january, 1923, upon, quinn, s, death, in, 1924, they, were, inherited, by, his, sister, julia, anderson, and, for, many, years, they, were, believed, lost, in, the, early, 1950s, mrs, anderson, s, daughter, mary, conroy, found, the, documents, in, storage, in, 1958, she, sold, them, privately, to, the, new, york, public, library, it, was, not, until, april, 1968, three, years, after, eliot, s, death, that, the, existence, and, whereabouts, of, the, manuscript, drafts, were, made, known, to, valerie, eliot, his, second, wife, in, 1971, a, facsimile, of, the, original, drafts, was, published, containing, pound, s, annotations, edited, and, annotated, by, valerie, eliot, the, initial, reviews, of, the, poem, were, mixed, some, critics, disparaged, its, disjointed, structure, and, suggested, that, its, extensive, use, of, quotations, gave, it, a, sense, of, unoriginality, f, l, lucas, wrote, a, particularly, negative, review, in, the, new, statesman, stating, that, eliot, has, shown, that, he, can, at, moments, write, real, blank, verse, but, that, is, all, the, guardian, published, a, review, calling, it, waste, paper, and, the, london, mercury, considered, it, incomprehensible, william, carlos, williams, considered, it, to, have, had, a, negative, influence, on, american, literature, writing, that, it, had, set, back, twenty, years, gilbert, seldes, who, first, published, the, poem, in, the, us, and, pound, its, editor, both, defended, it, as, did, conrad, aiken, who, described, it, in, a, 1923, review, as, one, of, the, most, moving, and, original, poems, of, our, time, although, he, found, the, form, incoherent, seldes, commissioned, a, review, from, edmund, wilson, which, was, positive, and, other, admirers, included, e, m, forster, and, cyril, connolly, contemporary, poets, and, young, writers, responded, to, the, poem, s, modern, style, and, content, a, mini, phenomenon, later, described, as, a, cult, of, the, waste, landers, subsequent, reviews, and, criticism, debated, the, value, of, some, of, eliot, s, innovations, his, notes, and, quotations, were, one, source, of, disagreement, they, were, considered, either, distracting, or, confusing, if, not, pedantic, and, unpoetic, or, the, very, basis, of, a, new, and, significant, poetic, technique, similarly, the, structure, of, the, poem, or, lack, thereof, continued, to, generate, debate, as, did, interpretations, of, the, themes, themselves, i, a, richards, praised, eliot, on, these, points, in, his, 1926, book, principles, of, literary, criticism, describing, his, imagery, technique, as, a, music, of, ideas, and, in, the, 1930s, richards, commentary, was, taken, further, by, f, r, leavis, f, o, matthiessen, and, cleanth, brooks, who, believed, that, despite, its, apparent, disjointedness, the, poem, contains, an, underlying, unity, of, form, for, leavis, represented, by, the, figure, of, tiresias, and, for, matthiessen, and, brooks, by, the, grail, mythology, this, view, became, dominant, for, the, next, three, decades, eliot, originally, considered, entitling, the, poem, he, do, the, police, in, different, voices, and, in, the, original, manuscripts, the, first, two, sections, of, the, poem, appear, under, this, title, this, phrase, is, taken, from, charles, dickens, novel, our, mutual, friend, in, which, the, widow, betty, higden, says, of, her, adopted, foundling, son, sloppy, you, mightn, t, think, it, but, sloppy, is, a, beautiful, reader, of, a, newspaper, he, do, the, police, in, different, voices, in, the, end, the, title, eliot, chose, was, the, waste, land, in, his, first, note, to, the, poem, he, attributes, the, title, to, jessie, weston, s, book, on, the, grail, legend, from, ritual, to, romance, 1920, did, he, live, his, life, again, in, every, detail, of, desire, temptation, and, surrender, during, that, supreme, moment, of, complete, knowledge, he, cried, in, a, whisper, at, some, image, at, some, vision, he, cried, out, twice, a, cry, that, was, no, more, than, a, breath, the, horror, the, horror, joseph, conrad, heart, of, darkness, eliot, s, original, choice, of, epigraph, the, poem, is, preceded, by, a, latin, and, ancient, greek, epigraph, without, translation, from, chapter, 48, of, the, satyricon, of, petronius, eliot, originally, intended, the, epigraph, to, be, a, small, section, of, joseph, conrad, s, heart, of, darkness, describing, the, death, of, the, character, kurtz, pound, suggested, it, be, changed, as, he, felt, conrad, was, not, weighty, enough, although, it, is, unclear, if, he, was, referring, to, the, author, or, the, quotation, itself, following, the, epigraph, is, a, dedication, added, in, a, 1925, republication, that, reads, for, ezra, pound, il, miglior, fabbro, the, better, craftsman, here, eliot, is, quoting, both, canto, xxvi, of, dante, s, purgatorio, where, dante, pays, troubadour, arnaut, daniel, the, same, compliment, and, pound, s, the, spirit, of, romance, 1910, which, contains, a, chapter, with, that, title, and, which, quotes, that, section, of, purgatorio, this, dedication, was, originally, handwritten, by, eliot, in, the, 1922, boni, liveright, edition, of, the, poem, presented, to, pound, it, was, included, in, later, editions, the, section, title, comes, from, the, anglican, burial, service, it, opens, with, a, description, of, spring, as, something, to, be, dreaded, with, the, comforting, static, nature, of, winter, giving, way, to, the, forcible, activity, of, spring, eliot, moves, to, the, more, specific, location, of, central, europe, around, the, period, of, the, first, world, war, and, adopts, a, prophetic, tone, describing, a, sterile, desert, quotations, from, the, operatic, love, story, tristan, und, isolde, bookend, a, memory, of, the, hyacinth, girl, with, the, narrator, trapped, in, a, static, existence, between, life, and, death, unable, to, profess, his, love, the, scene, then, moves, to, the, fortune, teller, madame, sosostris, who, is, described, in, ironically, down, to, earth, terms, and, the, tarot, cards, she, draws, foretell, events, in, the, rest, of, the, poem, the, final, part, of, the, burial, of, the, dead, is, a, description, of, london, as, dante, s, hell, with, inhabitants, trapped, in, a, death, like, state, following, a, meaningless, routine, this, section, centres, around, women, and, seduction, with, the, title, a, reference, to, the, jacobean, play, women, beware, women, in, which, the, character, bianca, is, seduced, while, her, mother, in, law, is, distracted, by, a, game, of, chess, its, first, scene, describes, an, elaborately, decorated, room, recalling, classical, lovers, such, as, mark, antony, and, cleopatra, or, dido, and, aeneas, the, narrative, moves, to, more, disturbing, references, such, as, to, philomela, who, was, raped, and, turned, into, a, nightingale, and, the, poem, depicts, her, as, still, suffering, at, the, hands, of, an, uncaring, world, this, moves, to, a, conversation, between, an, anxious, woman, and, the, thoughts, of, her, husband, who, does, not, reply, his, thoughts, are, preoccupied, with, loss, and, death, the, second, part, of, the, section, is, set, in, an, east, end, pub, and, features, a, conversation, between, working, class, cockney, women, they, discuss, childbearing, infidelity, and, abortion, in, a, matter, of, fact, manner, and, appear, to, be, trapped, in, loveless, superficial, relationships, the, end, of, the, section, sees, eliot, interleave, the, words, of, the, barman, calling, last, orders, hurry, up, please, its, time, and, the, last, words, of, ophelia, in, hamlet, before, her, suicide, by, drowning, signifying, the, inevitability, of, ageing, and, death, a, reference, to, edmund, spenser, s, poem, prothalamion, which, describes, an, elegant, aristocratic, summer, wedding, by, the, river, thames, contrasts, with, the, decaying, and, polluted, modern, state, of, the, setting, similarly, the, beautiful, nymphs, of, the, past, have, been, replaced, by, prostitutes, and, the, washing, of, their, feet, in, soda, water, is, ironically, contrasted, with, the, washing, of, feet, performed, by, choir, boys, in, some, tellings, of, the, fisher, king, legend, this, is, followed, by, a, brief, description, of, a, dirty, london, and, mr, eugenides, the, one, eyed, smyrna, merchant, foreseen, by, madame, sosostris, the, narrative, then, moves, to, a, description, of, a, loveless, tryst, between, a, typist, and, a, young, man, carbuncular, both, acting, mechanically, their, automatic, motions, underscored, by, eliot, s, use, of, rhyme, they, are, observed, by, the, figure, of, tiresias, a, character, taken, from, classical, myth, who, lived, as, a, woman, for, seven, years, and, then, was, blinded, and, given, the, gift, of, prophecy, unlike, the, previous, allusions, to, times, past, tiresias, indicates, that, love, has, always, been, this, dispassionate, and, squalid, the, poem, moves, back, to, the, thames, again, using, allusions, to, the, past, to, highlight, its, current, state, of, decay, and, sterility, but, the, section, ends, on, a, possibly, hopeful, note, with, the, words, of, st, augustine, and, the, buddha, both, of, whom, lived, lives, of, extravagance, before, adopting, asceticism, it, is, only, at, this, point, that, the, reason, for, the, section, title, is, clear, the, fire, sermon, being, a, teaching, delivered, by, the, buddha, this, is, the, shortest, section, of, the, poem, describing, the, aftermath, of, the, drowning, of, phoenician, sailor, phlebas, an, event, forewarned, by, madame, sosostris, his, corpse, is, still, trapped, in, a, whirlpool, that, serves, as, a, metaphor, for, the, cycle, of, life, and, death, and, serves, as, a, warning, to, pursue, a, meaningful, life, the, poem, returns, to, the, arid, desert, scene, visited, in, part, i, rain, has, not, arrived, despite, the, promise, from, thunder, and, the, approaching, spring, a, description, of, a, journey, across, the, desert, is, interspersed, with, references, to, the, death, and, resurrection, of, jesus, implying, that, the, journey, has, a, spiritual, element, the, journey, ends, at, a, chapel, but, it, is, ruined, rain, finally, arrives, with, the, thunder, and, its, noise, is, linked, with, text, from, the, hindu, brihadaranyaka, upanishad, joining, eastern, religion, with, western, the, thunder, implores, the, narrator, to, give, but, the, associated, imagery, suggests, he, may, already, be, dead, to, sympathise, but, he, contends, that, every, person, is, trapped, in, their, own, self, centred, prison, and, to, control, which, is, explored, with, the, metaphor, of, a, sailor, co, operating, with, wind, and, water, the, narrator, ends, up, fishing, at, the, sea, shore, having, travelled, across, the, desert, he, considers, taking, some, form, of, action, in, his, final, question, shall, i, at, least, set, my, lands, in, order, but, does, not, resolve, to, do, anything, the, poem, ends, with, fragmentary, quotations, perhaps, suggesting, the, possibility, of, new, life, and, finally, the, line, shantih, shantih, shantih, peace, peace, peace, the, formal, ending, to, an, upanishad, the, text, of, the, poem, is, followed, by, several, pages, of, notes, by, eliot, purporting, to, explain, his, own, metaphors, references, and, allusions, these, were, included, in, order, to, lengthen, the, work, so, that, it, could, be, published, as, a, book, as, well, as, to, pre, empt, accusations, of, plagiarism, which, his, earlier, work, had, been, charged, with, pound, later, observed, that, the, notes, served, to, pique, the, interest, of, reviewers, and, academic, critics, however, they, are, considered, to, be, of, limited, use, for, interpreting, the, poem, and, eliot, s, own, interpretations, changed, over, the, succeeding, decades, eliot, later, expressed, some, regret, at, including, the, notes, at, all, saying, in, 1956, that, they, had, prompted, the, remarkable, exposition, of, bogus, scholarship, a, game, of, chess, lines, 117, 130, the, style, of, the, poem, is, marked, by, the, many, intertextual, allusions, and, quotations, that, eliot, included, and, their, juxtaposition, in, addition, to, the, many, highbrow, references, and, quotations, from, poets, such, as, baudelaire, dante, ovid, and, homer, he, included, several, references, to, lowbrow, genres, such, as, an, allusion, to, the, 1912, popular, song, that, shakespearian, rag, by, gene, buck, herman, ruby, and, dave, stamper, the, poem, contrasts, such, elements, throughout, ornate, vocabulary, gives, way, to, colloquial, dialogue, lyrical, moments, are, interrupted, by, sordid, intrusions, the, comic, and, the, macabre, coexist, with, the, solemn, words, of, religious, instruction, one, language, is, supplanted, by, another, until, in, the, final, lines, of, the, poem, the, fragments, are, collected, together, the, waste, land, is, notable, for, its, seemingly, disjointed, structure, employing, a, wide, variety, of, voices, which, are, presented, sometimes, in, monologue, dialogue, or, with, more, than, two, characters, speaking, the, poem, jumps, from, one, voice, or, image, to, another, without, clearly, delineating, these, shifts, for, the, reader, creating, the, paradoxical, effect, of, a, poem, which, contains, deeply, personal, subject, matter, being, simultaneously, an, impersonal, collage, as, eliot, explained, in, his, 1919, essay, tradition, and, the, individual, talent, he, saw, the, ideal, poet, as, a, conduit, who, creates, a, piece, of, art, that, reflects, culture, and, society, as, well, as, their, own, perspective, and, experiences, in, an, impersonal, and, craftsmanlike, way, the, poem, plays, with, traditional, forms, of, metre, and, rhyme, often, implying, blank, verse, without, strictly, committing, to, it, especially, through, quotations, of, works, that, are, themselves, written, in, such, a, metre, lines, are, often, fragmented, and, verses, are, generally, of, unequal, length, although, there, are, instances, of, regularity, for, example, the, first, two, verses, of, the, fire, sermon, are, formed, like, petrarchan, sonnets, during, the, editing, process, pound, would, highlight, lines, that, were, too, penty, i, e, too, close, to, iambic, pentameter, prompting, them, to, be, changed, to, less, regular, rhythms, eliot, disliked, the, term, free, verse, however, believing, it, impossible, to, write, verse, that, is, truly, free, sources, which, eliot, quotes, or, alludes, to, include, the, works, of, classical, figures, sophocles, petronius, virgil, and, ovid, 14th, century, writers, dante, and, geoffrey, chaucer, elizabethan, and, jacobean, writers, edmund, spenser, thomas, kyd, william, shakespeare, thomas, middleton, and, john, webster, 19th, century, figures, g, rard, de, nerval, paul, verlaine, charles, baudelaire, alfred, tennyson, and, richard, wagner, and, more, contemporary, writers, aldous, huxley, hermann, hesse, frank, chapman, and, f, h, bradley, additionally, eliot, makes, extensive, use, of, religious, writings, including, the, christian, bible, and, book, of, common, prayer, the, hindu, brihadaranyaka, upanishad, and, the, buddha, s, fire, sermon, and, of, cultural, and, anthropological, studies, such, as, james, frazer, s, the, golden, bough, and, jessie, weston, s, from, ritual, to, romance, as, well, as, drawing, from, myth, and, fiction, eliot, included, people, he, knew, as, figures, in, the, poem, the, burial, of, the, dead, contains, the, character, marie, who, is, based, on, marie, larisch, and, the, hyacinth, girl, represents, emily, hale, with, whom, eliot, had, fallen, in, love, several, years, previously, a, game, of, chess, features, a, representation, of, vivienne, and, its, conversations, are, taken, from, those, overheard, by, the, couple, while, in, a, local, pub, scholars, have, identified, more, contemporary, artistic, influences, on, eliot, contrary, to, the, poet, s, own, focus, on, older, and, foreign, language, influences, eliot, had, read, early, drafts, of, parts, of, ulysses, and, corresponded, with, joyce, about, them, and, its, influence, is, seen, in, the, symbolist, use, of, cross, references, and, stylistic, variety, in, the, waste, land, as, well, as, the, mythic, parallels, between, the, characters, of, ulysses, and, those, of, the, odyssey, writing, that, this, mythical, method, had, the, importance, of, a, scientific, discovery, eliot, would, later, express, the, opinion, that, compared, to, the, waste, land, ulysses, was, a, superior, example, of, such, literary, developments, and, the, novel, has, been, described, as, the, most, important, model, for, the, poem, unlike, its, use, in, ulysses, however, eliot, saw, the, mythical, method, as, a, way, to, write, poetry, without, relying, on, conventional, narration, he, uses, his, mythical, sources, for, their, ritualistic, structures, rather, than, as, a, counterpoint, to, the, poem, s, story, eliot, was, resistant, to, ascribing, any, influence, to, walt, whitman, instead, expressing, a, preference, for, jules, laforgue, who, was, himself, a, whitman, translator, and, admirer, nevertheless, scholars, have, noted, strong, similarities, in, the, two, poets, use, of, free, verse, the, first, lines, of, the, waste, land, which, are, an, inversion, of, chaucer, s, opening, to, the, canterbury, tales, strongly, resemble, whitman, s, imagery, at, the, beginning, of, when, lilacs, last, in, the, dooryard, bloom, d, as, well, as, the, motif, of, lilacs, growing, in, the, spring, whitman, treats, the, inevitable, return, of, spring, as, an, occasion, for, mourning, the, death, that, allows, for, rebirth, a, similar, perspective, being, put, forward, by, eliot, and, completely, contrary, to, chaucer, who, celebrates, the, sweet, showers, of, april, bringing, forth, spring, flowers, scholar, pericles, lewis, further, argues, that, whitman, s, speech, like, rhythms, anticipate, the, even, more, free, style, of, the, waste, land, adhering, to, pound, s, dictum, that, verse, should, in, no, way, from, speech, save, by, a, heightened, intensity, i, e, simplicity, critic, harold, bloom, goes, on, to, identify, further, similarities, between, the, two, poems, with, eliot, s, third, who, always, walks, beside, you, as, whitman, s, knowledge, of, death, and, the, poems, themselves, as, an, elegy, for, the, poet, s, own, genius, rather, than, a, lament, for, western, civilization, the, waste, land, was, also, informed, by, developments, in, the, visual, arts, its, style, and, content, reflect, the, methods, of, cubism, and, futurism, to, take, apart, and, reassemble, their, subjects, in, different, forms, and, the, interest, of, surrealism, in, the, unconscious, mind, and, its, influence, on, culture, similar, themes, to, what, interested, eliot, about, the, golden, bough, scholar, jacob, korg, identifies, similarities, with, the, collage, techniques, of, braque, and, picasso, wherein, the, artists, increasingly, non, representational, works, would, include, a, small, piece, of, realistic, detail, in, the, same, sense, the, waste, land, directly, includes, reality, such, as, the, pub, conversation, and, the, phrase, london, bridge, is, falling, down, alongside, its, imagined, content, to, achieve, a, similar, effect, interpretations, of, the, waste, land, in, the, first, few, decades, after, its, publication, had, been, closely, linked, to, romance, due, to, eliot, s, prominent, acknowledgement, of, jessie, weston, s, 1920, book, from, ritual, to, romance, in, his, notes, eliot, s, 1956, disavowal, of, this, line, of, enquiry, with, his, comment, that, they, invited, bogus, scholarship, however, prompted, reinterpretations, of, the, poem, less, as, a, work, which, incorporates, previous, romantic, ideals, and, the, magic, of, the, grail, legend, and, more, as, a, poem, describing, alienation, fragmentation, despair, and, disenchantment, in, the, post, war, period, which, are, considered, typical, features, of, modernist, literature, in, his, notes, eliot, credits, weston, s, analysis, of, the, grail, legend, in, from, ritual, to, romance, with, inspiring, the, plan, and, a, good, deal, of, the, incidental, symbolism, of, the, poem, weston, concentrates, on, the, story, of, the, fisher, king, part, of, the, holy, grail, mythos, which, has, its, origins, in, perceval, the, story, of, the, grail, written, by, chr, tien, de, troyes, in, the, 1180s, in, the, story, perceval, is, a, young, man, who, meets, a, group, of, knights, one, day, in, the, forest, and, leaves, with, them, to, be, trained, in, knightly, ways, at, king, arthur, s, court, the, key, lesson, he, is, taught, is, not, to, speak, too, much, while, out, riding, one, day, perceval, meets, two, men, fishing, in, a, river, they, offer, him, hospitality, in, a, nearby, castle, in, the, castle, hall, he, meets, the, fisher, king, who, is, gravely, wounded, supernatural, events, begin, to, occur, a, boy, brings, a, white, lance, into, the, hall, and, a, drop, of, blood, falls, from, its, tip, two, more, boys, holding, candlesticks, appear, and, then, a, girl, holding, a, gold, grail, set, with, precious, stones, and, radiating, light, the, grail, in, this, telling, a, kind, of, platter, provides, food, for, the, guests, in, the, hall, remembering, his, training, perceval, asks, no, questions, about, these, strange, happenings, and, when, he, awakens, the, next, day, he, finds, the, hall, empty, his, apparent, lack, of, curiosity, has, been, taken, as, indifference, perceval, returns, to, camelot, and, while, at, the, round, table, a, loathsome, damsel, appears, to, denounce, him, saying, that, various, calamities, will, occur, because, the, fisher, king, cannot, defend, his, lands, still, being, in, his, injured, state, as, a, result, perceval, loses, his, religious, faith, five, years, later, perceval, seeks, help, from, his, uncle, a, hermit, his, uncle, instructs, him, in, knightly, ways, and, perceval, receives, communion, at, this, point, chr, tien, s, story, ends, it, was, continued, in, several, different, versions, by, various, authors, robert, de, boron, introduces, an, explicit, link, between, the, grail, and, jesus, crucifixion, and, in, this, version, perceval, returns, to, the, castle, asks, the, correct, secret, question, of, the, fisher, king, and, becomes, keeper, of, the, grail, himself, another, continuation, was, by, wolfram, von, eschenbach, who, made, the, fisher, king, s, injury, a, sterilising, groin, injury, and, the, question, perceval, asks, what, aileth, thee, mine, uncle, in, weston, s, translation, the, asking, of, the, question, an, act, of, compassion, is, ultimately, what, heals, the, king, and, restores, the, land, weston, interprets, the, story, of, the, fisher, king, as, a, continuation, of, pagan, fertility, rites, she, focuses, on, the, idea, of, a, waste, land, surrounding, the, fisher, king, s, castle, which, will, be, restored, along, with, the, king, s, health, only, after, the, correct, question, is, asked, in, this, sense, it, is, a, story, of, death, and, rebirth, as, well, as, an, allegory, for, reproduction, with, the, lance, representing, male, genitalia, and, the, grail, female, weston, considers, the, fish, symbol, as, an, analogy, for, fertility, a, connection, later, lost, in, readings, of, the, grail, legend, the, waste, land, can, be, interpreted, as, being, at, least, in, part, narrated, by, a, fisher, king, character, living, in, a, modern, industrial, wasted, land, eliot, s, notes, indicate, that, he, associated, the, fisher, king, with, one, of, the, tarot, cards, drawn, in, the, burial, of, the, dead, the, man, with, three, staves, the, fire, sermon, contains, a, figure, fruitlessly, fishing, in, a, polluted, canal, in, winter, as, a, direct, parallel, of, the, men, perceval, encountered, fishing, in, a, stream, and, the, final, verse, of, what, the, thunder, said, describes, a, fisher, king, character, fishing, in, the, sea, considering, the, question, shall, i, at, least, set, my, lands, in, order, the, mythic, themes, of, fertility, take, on, a, more, concrete, role, in, the, middle, parts, of, the, poem, which, deal, with, scenes, of, sexuality, a, game, of, chess, includes, a, scene, of, a, married, couple, playing, chess, in, an, opulent, setting, which, contrasts, with, two, sexless, dialogues, illustrating, two, aspects, of, the, terrible, emotional, barrenness, of, the, modern, world, the, section, continues, to, a, matter, of, fact, conversation, between, two, women, about, infidelity, and, abortion, blending, into, the, last, words, of, ophelia, in, hamlet, before, she, committed, suicide, by, drowning, an, end, to, life, rather, than, a, baptismal, rebirth, the, fire, sermon, describes, a, dispassionate, affair, perhaps, a, parody, of, frazer, s, sanctified, harlotry, ritual, in, which, in, order, to, promote, fertility, a, girl, consorted, with, a, stranger, before, marriage, the, act, being, accompanied, by, a, ritual, feast, and, music, themes, of, death, and, regeneration, more, generally, occur, throughout, the, waste, land, especially, in, the, burial, of, the, dead, unlike, in, fertility, myths, such, as, that, of, the, fisher, king, however, death, is, never, redeemed, by, any, clear, salvation, and, barrenness, is, relieved, only, by, a, chaotic, multiplicity, which, is, not, only, an, ironic, kind, of, fertility, but, is, also, the, distinctly, urban, chaos, that, the, young, eliot, appreciated, as, conducive, to, his, work, the, poem, opens, with, a, resistance, to, growth, after, a, winter, that, represents, a, living, death, and, a, yearning, for, stasis, which, contrasts, with, the, sibyl, of, the, epigraph, who, longs, for, a, death, that, means, escape, from, a, static, existence, the, burial, of, the, dead, also, describes, a, dry, and, lifeless, desert, scene, which, despite, the, prospect, of, shade, and, therefore, respite, promises, only, a, vision, of, death, to, show, you, fear, in, a, handful, of, dust, madame, sosostris, draws, the, drowned, phoenician, sailor, but, he, is, later, a, symbol, of, adonis, representing, the, promise, of, spring, and, thus, renewal, and, his, drowning, can, be, read, as, an, allegory, for, baptism, a, spiritual, rebirth, the, living, death, of, the, waste, land, sees, people, bury, corpses, and, expect, them, to, sprout, in, a, deliberate, reference, to, the, rituals, of, osiris, as, described, by, frazer, when, priests, would, bury, effigies, of, the, god, to, ensure, a, good, harvest, i, dislike, the, word, generation, which, has, been, a, talisman, for, the, last, ten, years, when, i, wrote, a, poem, called, the, waste, land, some, of, the, more, approving, critics, said, that, i, had, expressed, the, disillusionment, of, a, generation, which, is, nonsense, i, may, have, expressed, for, them, their, own, illusion, of, being, disillusioned, but, that, did, not, form, part, of, my, intention, t, s, eliot, thoughts, after, lambeth, 1931, the, waste, land, can, be, read, as, an, expression, of, post, war, disillusionment, and, anxieties, about, western, culture, critic, burton, rascoe, wrote, that, the, poem, gives, voice, to, the, universal, despair, or, resignation, arising, from, the, spiritual, and, economic, consequences, of, the, war, the, cross, purposes, of, modern, civilization, the, cul, de, sac, into, which, both, science, and, philosophy, seem, to, have, got, themselves, and, the, breakdown, of, all, great, directive, purposes, which, give, joy, and, zest, to, the, business, of, living, it, is, an, erudite, despair, eliot, disliked, being, described, as, a, poet, who, had, expressed, the, disillusionment, of, a, generation, but, this, was, a, reading, common, even, in, the, early, days, after, the, poem, s, publication, the, poem, describes, a, barren, modern, waste, land, after, the, largest, war, ever, fought, without, the, traditional, common, cultural, touchstones, of, religion, aristocracy, and, nationhood, being, unable, to, grow, anything, new, the, poet, has, only, a, heap, of, broken, images, from, ages, past, to, assemble, and, the, waste, land, represents, an, attempt, to, create, something, new, out, of, these, one, way, in, which, the, poem, expresses, this, disillusionment, is, in, the, contrast, between, its, quotations, and, allusions, to, older, texts, and, representations, of, the, modern, day, a, game, of, chess, contrasts, a, modern, woman, with, an, elaborate, description, of, queen, cleopatra, and, belinda, from, the, rape, of, the, lock, in, an, ornate, setting, it, also, juxtaposes, the, working, class, women, s, conversation, with, ophelia, s, last, words, in, hamlet, in, this, way, an, idealised, past, is, presented, as, an, unrealistically, prelapsarian, place, and, modern, civilisation, does, nothing, but, spoil, what, was, once, gracious, lovely, ceremonious, and, natural, scholars, observe, eliot, s, depiction, of, modern, london, as, being, an, example, of, these, themes, as, well, the, distasteful, description, of, the, river, thames, in, the, fire, sermon, invites, comparison, with, its, beauty, in, spenser, s, day, and, the, beautiful, rhinemaidens, of, wagner, s, ring, cycle, who, guard, gold, at, the, bottom, of, the, rhine, are, ironically, placed, in, the, polluted, thames, the, poem, s, final, verse, contains, the, titular, line, of, the, nursery, rhyme, london, bridge, is, falling, down, showing, that, even, with, the, optimism, of, potential, rebirth, the, city, is, destined, for, ruin, the, sounds, of, the, city, accompany, the, passionless, affair, of, the, typist, in, the, fire, sermon, linking, it, to, sterility, and, its, inhabitants, cannot, rely, on, a, shared, sense, of, community, they, live, in, a, version, of, dante, s, limbo, a, static, lifeless, realm, neither, life, nor, death, eliot, makes, a, direct, reference, to, inferno, in, the, line, i, had, not, thought, death, had, undone, so, many, and, indicates, that, the, people, living, in, this, city, have, chosen, through, cowardice, not, to, die, and, possibly, be, reborn, but, to, remain, in, this, state, of, living, death, christianity, infuses, the, fisher, king, legend, and, questions, of, death, and, rebirth, are, central, concerns, of, all, religions, the, bible, has, been, described, as, probably, the, single, most, pervasive, influence, on, the, poem, eliot, adopts, a, deliberately, prophetic, old, testament, tone, of, voice, in, the, burial, of, the, dead, referencing, ezekiel, and, ecclesiastes, the, ezekiel, source, describes, the, prophet, s, mission, in, a, secular, world, and, the, book, is, relevant, again, in, the, depiction, of, a, dry, desert, like, waste, land, ezekiel, prophesied, the, babylonian, captivity, which, is, alluded, to, in, the, description, of, the, thames, as, the, waters, of, leman, in, the, fire, sermon, the, ecclesiastes, section, referenced, contains, a, description, of, a, waste, land, and, what, the, thunder, said, refers, to, it, again, in, its, doors, of, mudcracked, houses, and, empty, cisterns, new, testament, symbols, include, the, card, of, the, hanged, man, which, represents, jesus, and, what, the, thunder, said, references, the, road, to, emmaus, appearance, in, which, the, resurrected, christ, is, not, recognised, by, his, disciples, the, waste, land, also, contains, allusions, to, buddhism, and, hinduism, both, of, which, eliot, came, into, contact, with, while, studying, as, a, postgraduate, in, the, department, of, philosophy, at, harvard, in, 1911, 1914, the, title, of, the, fire, sermon, takes, its, name, from, the, buddhist, discourse, of, the, same, name, which, uses, the, metaphor, of, fire, to, mean, both, the, inherent, pain, of, physical, existence, and, the, process, of, purification, to, transcend, that, pain, eliot, juxtaposes, the, buddha, with, st, augustine, both, representing, historical, figures, who, turned, away, from, worldly, pleasures, to, follow, a, life, of, asceticism, their, combined, voices, blend, into, the, poem, s, narrator, at, the, end, of, the, section, thou, pluckest, me, out, becoming, the, voice, of, prophecy, and, the, section, tails, off, in, a, meditative, fashion, losing, the, narrator, me, then, lord, leaving, only, burning, sanskrit, quotations, from, the, hindu, brihadaranyaka, upanishad, part, of, the, collection, of, texts, known, as, the, vedas, occur, throughout, the, final, section, what, the, thunder, said, the, three, words, datta, dayadhvam, and, damyata, are, an, instruction, to, observe, charity, compassion, and, self, control, and, the, poem, s, final, line, is, the, same, as, that, of, every, upanishad, shantih, shantih, shantih, peace, peace, peace, this, gives, the, impression, of, a, desire, for, the, readers, to, end, their, post, war, suffering, on, the, physical, natural, and, spiritual, planes, by, following, these, virtues, the, poem, contains, other, allusions, to, hindu, scripture, such, as, the, appearance, of, the, sacred, river, ganges, called, by, its, traditional, name, in, the, line, ganga, was, sunken, and, it, can, be, read, as, an, allegory, similar, to, themes, found, in, the, vedas, where, drought, or, sterility, is, caused, by, an, evil, force, in, this, reading, the, poet, takes, the, role, of, a, priest, whose, role, is, to, purify, the, land, and, release, its, potential, fertility, the, waste, land, is, considered, to, be, one, of, the, most, important, and, influential, poems, of, the, 20th, century, the, poem, has, been, praised, for, its, aesthetic, value, and, its, originality, influenced, modernist, poets, while, we, have, become, accustomed, to, such, poetic, techniques, as, allusion, ironic, juxtaposition, and, sudden, shifts, in, imagery, and, style, eliot, s, use, of, them, seemed, strikingly, new, in, 1922, lewis, 2007, comments, that, later, poetic, practice, was, largely, shaped, by, pound, s, advocacy, of, free, verse, and, eliot, s, example, and, pound, later, took, eliot, s, example, of, using, different, languages, even, further, including, chinese, characters, in, his, cantos, which, would, have, been, completely, unintelligible, to, a, large, majority, of, his, readers, the, poem, has, influenced, several, prose, works, george, orwell, used, allusive, techniques, in, a, manner, influenced, by, eliot, most, clearly, in, the, popular, song, references, of, keep, the, aspidistra, flying, and, the, epigraphs, of, down, and, out, in, london, and, paris, and, coming, up, for, air, similarly, the, sound, and, the, fury, by,
