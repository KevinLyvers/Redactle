rhapsody, in, blue, is, a, 1924, musical, composition, for, solo, piano, and, jazz, band, which, combines, elements, of, classical, music, with, jazz, influenced, effects, commissioned, by, bandleader, paul, whiteman, and, written, by, george, gershwin, the, work, premiered, in, a, concert, titled, an, experiment, in, modern, music, on, february, 12, 1924, in, aeolian, hall, new, york, city, whiteman, s, band, performed, the, rhapsody, with, gershwin, playing, the, piano, whiteman, s, arranger, ferde, grof, orchestrated, the, rhapsody, several, times, including, the, 1924, original, scoring, the, 1926, pit, orchestra, scoring, and, the, 1942, symphonic, scoring, the, rhapsody, is, one, of, gershwin, s, most, recognizable, creations, and, a, key, composition, that, defined, the, jazz, age, gershwin, s, piece, inaugurated, a, new, era, in, america, s, musical, history, established, his, reputation, as, an, eminent, composer, and, became, one, of, the, most, popular, of, all, concert, works, in, the, american, heritage, magazine, frederic, d, schwarz, posits, that, the, famous, opening, clarinet, glissando, has, become, as, instantly, recognizable, to, concert, audiences, as, the, opening, of, beethoven, s, fifth, symphony, following, the, success, of, an, experimental, classical, jazz, concert, held, with, canadian, singer, va, gauthier, in, new, york, city, on, november, 1, 1923, bandleader, paul, whiteman, decided, to, attempt, a, more, ambitious, feat, he, asked, composer, george, gershwin, to, write, a, concerto, like, piece, for, an, all, jazz, concert, in, honor, of, lincoln, s, birthday, to, be, given, at, aeolian, hall, whiteman, became, fixated, upon, performing, such, an, extended, composition, by, gershwin, after, he, collaborated, with, him, in, the, scandals, of, 1922, he, had, been, especially, impressed, by, gershwin, s, one, act, jazz, opera, blue, monday, gershwin, initially, declined, whiteman, s, request, on, the, grounds, that, he, would, have, insufficient, time, to, compose, the, work, and, there, would, likely, be, a, need, to, revise, the, score, soon, after, on, the, evening, of, january, 3, george, gershwin, and, lyricist, buddy, desylva, played, a, game, of, billiards, at, the, ambassador, billiard, parlor, at, broadway, and, 52nd, street, in, manhattan, george, s, brother, ira, gershwin, interrupted, their, billiard, game, to, read, aloud, the, january, 4, edition, of, the, new, york, tribune, an, unsigned, tribune, article, entitled, what, is, american, music, about, an, upcoming, whiteman, concert, had, caught, ira, s, attention, the, article, falsely, declared, that, george, gershwin, had, begun, work, on, a, jazz, concerto, for, whiteman, s, concert, the, news, announcement, puzzled, gershwin, as, he, had, politely, declined, to, compose, any, such, work, for, whiteman, in, a, telephone, conversation, with, whiteman, the, next, morning, whiteman, informed, gershwin, that, whiteman, s, arch, rival, vincent, lopez, planned, to, steal, the, idea, of, his, experimental, concert, and, there, was, no, time, to, lose, whiteman, thus, finally, persuaded, gershwin, to, compose, the, piece, with, only, five, weeks, remaining, until, the, premiere, gershwin, hurriedly, set, about, composing, the, work, he, later, claimed, that, while, on, a, train, journey, to, boston, the, thematic, seeds, for, rhapsody, in, blue, began, to, germinate, in, his, mind, he, told, biographer, isaac, goldberg, in, 1931, it, was, on, the, train, with, its, steely, rhythms, its, rattle, ty, bang, that, is, so, often, so, stimulating, to, a, composer, i, frequently, hear, music, in, the, very, heart, of, the, noise, and, there, i, suddenly, heard, and, even, saw, on, paper, the, complete, construction, of, the, rhapsody, from, beginning, to, end, no, new, themes, came, to, me, but, i, worked, on, the, thematic, material, already, in, my, mind, and, tried, to, conceive, the, composition, as, a, whole, i, heard, it, as, a, sort, of, musical, kaleidoscope, of, america, of, our, vast, melting, pot, of, our, unduplicated, national, pep, of, our, metropolitan, madness, by, the, time, i, reached, boston, i, had, a, definite, plot, of, the, piece, as, distinguished, from, its, actual, substance, gershwin, began, composing, on, january, 7, as, dated, on, the, original, manuscript, for, two, pianos, he, tentatively, entitled, the, piece, as, american, rhapsody, during, its, composition, ira, gershwin, suggested, the, revised, title, of, rhapsody, in, blue, after, his, visit, to, a, gallery, exhibition, of, james, mcneill, whistler, paintings, which, had, titles, such, as, nocturne, in, black, and, gold, the, falling, rocket, and, arrangement, in, grey, and, black, after, a, few, weeks, gershwin, finished, his, composition, and, passed, the, score, titled, a, rhapsody, in, blue, to, ferde, grof, whiteman, s, arranger, grof, finished, orchestrating, the, piece, on, february, 4, a, mere, eight, days, before, the, premiere, rhapsody, in, blue, premiered, during, a, snowy, tuesday, afternoon, on, february, 12, 1924, at, aeolian, hall, manhattan, entitled, an, experiment, in, modern, music, the, much, anticipated, concert, held, by, paul, whiteman, and, his, palais, royal, orchestra, drew, a, packed, house, the, excited, audience, consisted, of, vaudevillians, concert, managers, come, to, have, a, look, at, the, novelty, tin, pan, alleyites, composers, symphony, and, opera, stars, flappers, cake, eaters, all, mixed, up, higgledy, piggledy, a, number, of, influential, figures, of, the, era, were, present, including, carl, van, vechten, marguerite, d, alvarez, victor, herbert, walter, damrosch, and, willie, the, lion, smith, in, a, pre, concert, lecture, whiteman, s, manager, hugh, c, ernst, proclaimed, the, purpose, of, the, concert, to, be, purely, educational, whiteman, had, selected, the, music, to, exemplify, the, melodies, harmony, and, rhythms, which, agitate, the, throbbing, emotional, resources, of, this, young, restless, age, the, concert, s, lengthy, program, listed, 26, separate, musical, movements, divided, into, 2, parts, and, 11, sections, bearing, titles, such, as, true, form, of, jazz, and, contrast, legitimate, scoring, vs, jazzing, the, program, s, schedule, featured, gershwin, s, rhapsody, as, merely, the, penultimate, piece, which, preceded, elgar, s, pomp, and, circumstance, march, no, 1, many, of, the, early, numbers, in, the, program, underwhelmed, the, audience, and, the, ventilation, system, in, the, concert, hall, malfunctioned, some, audience, members, had, departed, the, venue, by, the, time, gershwin, made, his, inconspicuous, entrance, for, the, rhapsody, the, audience, purportedly, were, irritable, impatient, and, restless, until, the, haunting, clarinet, glissando, played, the, opening, notes, of, rhapsody, in, blue, the, distinctive, glissando, had, been, created, quite, by, happenstance, during, rehearsals, as, a, joke, on, gershwin, gorman, played, the, opening, measure, with, a, noticeable, glissando, stretching, the, notes, out, and, adding, what, he, considered, a, jazzy, humorous, touch, to, the, passage, reacting, favorably, to, gorman, s, whimsy, gershwin, asked, him, to, perform, the, opening, measure, that, way, and, to, add, as, much, of, a, wail, as, possible, whiteman, s, orchestra, performed, the, rhapsody, with, twenty, three, musicians, in, the, ensemble, and, george, gershwin, on, piano, in, characteristic, style, gershwin, chose, to, partially, improvise, his, piano, solo, the, orchestra, anxiously, waited, for, gershwin, s, nod, which, signaled, the, end, of, his, piano, solo, and, the, cue, for, the, ensemble, to, resume, playing, as, gershwin, did, not, write, the, solo, piano, section, until, after, the, concert, it, remains, unknown, exactly, how, the, original, rhapsody, sounded, at, the, premiere, upon, the, conclusion, of, the, rhapsody, the, audience, tumultuously, applauded, gershwin, s, composition, and, quite, unexpectedly, the, concert, in, every, respect, but, the, financial, became, a, knockout, the, concert, soon, became, historically, significant, due, to, the, premiere, of, the, rhapsody, and, its, program, would, become, not, only, a, historic, document, finding, its, way, into, foreign, monographs, on, jazz, but, a, rarity, as, well, following, the, success, of, the, rhapsody, s, premiere, future, performances, followed, the, first, british, performance, of, rhapsody, in, blue, took, place, at, the, savoy, hotel, in, london, on, june, 15, 1925, the, bbc, broadcast, the, performance, in, a, live, relay, debroy, somers, conducted, the, savoy, orpheans, with, gershwin, himself, at, the, piano, audiences, heard, the, piece, again, in, the, united, kingdom, during, the, second, european, tour, of, the, paul, whiteman, orchestra, most, notably, on, april, 11, 1926, at, the, royal, albert, hall, with, gershwin, in, the, audience, the, gramophone, company, hmv, recorded, this, performance, by, the, end, of, 1927, whiteman, s, band, had, performed, rhapsody, in, blue, approximately, 84, times, and, its, recording, sold, a, million, copies, for, the, entire, piece, to, fit, onto, two, sides, of, a, 12, inch, record, the, rhapsody, had, to, be, played, at, a, faster, speed, than, usual, in, a, concert, which, gave, the, recording, a, hurried, feel, with, noticeably, lost, rubato, whiteman, later, adopted, the, piece, as, his, band, s, theme, song, and, opened, his, radio, programs, with, the, slogan, everything, new, but, the, rhapsody, in, blue, this, composition, shows, extraordinary, talent, as, it, shows, a, young, composer, with, aims, that, go, far, beyond, those, of, his, ilk, struggling, with, a, form, of, which, he, is, far, from, being, master, in, spite, of, all, this, he, has, expressed, himself, in, a, significant, and, on, the, whole, highly, original, form, his, first, theme, is, no, mere, dance, tune, it, is, an, idea, or, several, ideas, correlated, and, combined, in, varying, and, contrasting, rhythms, that, immediately, intrigue, the, listener, the, second, theme, is, more, after, the, manner, of, some, of, mr, gershwin, s, colleagues, tuttis, are, too, long, cadenzas, are, too, long, the, peroration, at, the, end, loses, a, large, measure, of, the, wildness, and, magnificence, it, could, easily, have, had, if, it, were, more, broadly, prepared, and, for, all, that, the, audience, was, stirred, and, many, a, hardened, concertgoer, excited, with, the, sensation, of, a, new, talent, finding, its, voice, olin, downes, the, new, york, times, february, 1924, in, contrast, to, the, warm, reception, by, concert, audiences, music, critics, gave, the, rhapsody, mixed, reviews, samuel, chotzinoff, music, critic, of, the, new, york, world, conceded, that, gershwin, s, composition, had, made, an, honest, woman, out, of, jazz, while, henrietta, strauss, of, the, nation, opined, that, gershwin, had, added, a, new, chapter, to, our, musical, history, olin, downes, reviewing, the, concert, in, the, new, york, times, favorably, noted, the, rhapsody, as, a, highly, original, form, and, the, composer, as, a, new, talent, finding, its, voice, nonetheless, other, reviewers, were, less, positive, pitts, sanborn, declared, that, the, rhapsody, begins, with, a, promising, theme, well, stated, yet, soon, runs, off, into, empty, passage, work, and, meaningless, repetition, a, number, of, reviews, were, particularly, negative, lawrence, gilman, a, richard, wagner, enthusiast, who, would, later, write, a, devastating, review, of, gershwin, s, porgy, and, bess, harshly, criticized, the, rhapsody, as, derivative, stale, and, inexpressive, in, a, new, york, tribune, review, on, february, 13, 1924, overall, professional, music, critics, recurrently, criticized, gershwin, s, piece, as, essentially, formless, and, asserted, that, the, composer, had, haphazardly, glued, melodic, segments, together, years, after, its, premiere, rhapsody, in, blue, continued, to, divide, music, critics, principally, due, to, its, perceived, melodic, incoherence, constant, lambert, a, british, composer, whose, oeuvre, often, incorporated, jazz, elements, openly, dismissed, the, work, the, composer, trying, to, write, a, lisztian, concerto, in, a, jazz, style, has, used, only, the, non, barbaric, elements, in, dance, music, the, result, being, neither, good, jazz, nor, good, liszt, and, in, no, sense, of, the, word, a, good, concerto, in, an, article, in, the, atlantic, monthly, in, 1955, leonard, bernstein, who, nevertheless, admitted, that, he, adored, the, piece, stated, rhapsody, in, blue, is, not, a, real, composition, in, the, sense, that, whatever, happens, in, it, must, seem, inevitable, or, even, pretty, inevitable, you, can, cut, out, parts, of, it, without, affecting, the, whole, in, any, way, except, to, make, it, shorter, you, can, remove, any, of, these, stuck, together, sections, and, the, piece, still, goes, on, as, bravely, as, before, you, can, even, interchange, these, sections, with, one, another, and, no, harm, done, you, can, make, cuts, within, a, section, or, add, new, cadenzas, or, play, it, with, any, combination, of, instruments, or, on, the, piano, alone, it, can, be, a, five, minute, piece, or, a, six, minute, piece, or, a, twelve, minute, piece, and, in, fact, all, these, things, are, being, done, to, it, every, day, it, s, still, the, rhapsody, in, blue, as, gershwin, did, not, have, sufficient, knowledge, of, orchestration, in, 1924, whiteman, s, pianist, and, chief, arranger, ferde, grof, played, a, key, role, in, the, rhapsody, s, meteoric, success, and, scholars, have, contended, that, grof, s, arrangements, of, the, rhapsody, secured, its, place, in, american, culture, gershwin, s, biographer, isaac, goldberg, noted, in, 1931, that, grof, played, a, crucial, role, in, the, premiere, s, triumph, in, the, heat, of, the, occasion, the, contribution, of, ferdie, grof, the, arranger, on, the, whiteman, staff, who, had, scored, the, rhapsody, in, ten, days, was, overlooked, or, ignored, it, is, true, that, an, appreciable, part, of, the, scoring, had, been, indicated, by, gershwin, nevertheless, the, contribution, of, grof, was, of, prime, importance, not, only, to, the, composition, but, to, the, jazz, scoring, of, the, immediate, future, grof, hastily, arranged, the, famous, 1924, score, to, take, full, advantage, of, the, whiteman, orchestra, s, particular, strengths, he, developed, this, orchestration, for, solo, piano, and, whiteman, s, twenty, three, musicians, for, the, reeds, section, ross, gorman, reed, i, played, an, oboe, a, heckelphone, a, clarinet, in, b, sopranino, saxophones, in, e, b, an, alto, saxophone, one, e, soprano, clarinet, and, alto, and, bass, clarinets, donald, clark, reed, ii, played, a, soprano, saxophone, in, b, alto, and, baritone, saxophones, and, hale, byers, reed, iii, played, soprano, saxophone, in, b, tenor, saxophone, baritone, saxophone, and, a, flute, for, the, brass, section, two, trumpets, in, b, were, played, by, henry, busse, and, frank, siegrist, two, french, horns, in, f, were, played, by, arturo, cerino, and, al, corrado, two, trombones, were, played, by, roy, maxon, and, james, casseday, and, a, tuba, and, a, double, bass, played, by, guss, helleburg, and, alus, armer, respectively, the, percussion, section, included, a, drum, set, timpani, and, a, glockenspiel, played, by, george, marsh, one, piano, typically, played, by, either, ferde, grof, or, henry, lange, one, tenor, banjo, played, by, michael, pingatore, and, a, complement, of, violins, musicologists, largely, ignored, this, original, arrangement, with, its, unique, instrumental, requirements, until, its, revival, in, reconstructions, beginning, in, the, mid, 1980s, owing, to, the, popularity, and, serviceability, of, the, later, scorings, after, the, 1924, premiere, grof, revised, the, score, and, made, new, orchestrations, in, 1926, and, 1942, each, time, for, larger, orchestras, he, published, his, arrangement, for, a, theater, orchestra, in, 1926, grof, orchestrated, this, adaptation, for, a, more, standard, pit, orchestra, which, included, one, flute, one, oboe, two, clarinets, one, bassoon, three, saxophones, two, french, horns, two, trumpets, and, two, trombones, as, well, as, the, same, percussion, and, strings, complement, as, the, later, 1942, version, grof, later, produced, a, 1942, arrangement, for, a, full, symphony, orchestra, it, is, scored, for, solo, piano, and, an, orchestra, consisting, of, two, flutes, two, oboes, two, clarinets, in, b, and, a, one, bass, clarinet, two, bassoons, two, alto, saxophones, in, e, one, tenor, saxophone, in, b, three, french, horns, in, f, three, trumpets, in, b, three, trombones, one, tuba, a, percussion, section, that, includes, timpani, one, suspended, cymbal, one, snare, drum, one, bass, drum, one, tam, tam, one, triangle, one, glockenspiel, and, cymbals, one, tenor, banjo, and, strings, since, the, mid, 20th, century, the, 1942, arrangement, became, a, staple, of, the, concert, repertoire, until, 1976, when, michael, tilson, thomas, recorded, the, original, jazz, band, version, for, the, first, time, employing, gershwin, s, actual, 1925, piano, roll, with, a, full, jazz, orchestra, grof, s, other, arrangements, of, gershwin, s, piece, include, those, done, for, whiteman, s, 1930, film, king, of, jazz, and, the, concert, band, setting, playable, without, piano, completed, by, 1938, and, published, 1942, the, prominence, of, the, saxophones, in, the, later, orchestrations, is, somewhat, reduced, and, the, banjo, part, can, be, dispensed, with, as, its, mainly, rhythmic, contribution, is, provided, by, the, inner, strings, gershwin, himself, made, versions, of, the, piece, for, solo, piano, as, well, as, two, pianos, the, solo, version, is, notable, for, omitting, several, sections, of, the, piece, gershwin, s, intent, to, eventually, do, an, orchestration, of, his, own, is, documented, in, 1936, 37, correspondence, from, the, publisher, harms, after, the, warm, reception, of, rhapsody, in, blue, by, the, audience, at, aeolian, hall, gershwin, recorded, several, abridged, versions, of, his, composition, in, different, formats, on, june, 10, 1924, gershwin, and, whiteman, s, orchestra, created, an, acoustic, recording, running, 8, minutes, and, 59, seconds, and, issued, by, the, victor, talking, machine, company, a, year, later, gershwin, recorded, his, performance, on, a, 1925, piano, roll, for, a, two, piano, version, later, on, april, 21, 1927, he, made, an, electrical, recording, with, whiteman, s, orchestra, running, 9, minutes, and, 1, second, and, again, recorded, by, victor, nathaniel, shilkret, purportedly, conducted, the, electrical, recording, after, a, dispute, between, gershwin, and, whiteman, whiteman, s, orchestra, later, performed, a, truncated, version, of, the, piece, in, the, 1930, film, the, king, of, jazz, with, roy, bargy, on, piano, due, to, the, length, limitations, of, early, recording, formats, the, first, complete, and, unabridged, recording, of, gershwin, s, composition, did, not, occur, until, the, great, depression, in, july, 1935, after, several, years, of, performing, the, rhapsody, for, sold, out, audiences, in, massachusetts, conductor, arthur, fiedler, and, the, boston, pops, orchestra, recorded, the, first, unabridged, version, nearly, fourteen, minutes, in, length, with, puerto, rican, pianist, jes, s, mar, a, sanrom, for, rca, victor, for, this, first, unabridged, recording, fiedler, discarded, ferde, grof, s, original, 1924, arrangement, and, adapted, the, piece, for, a, conventional, symphony, at, the, time, contemporary, critics, praised, fiedler, for, jettisoning, the, so, called, jazzy, sentimentality, of, grof, s, earlier, arrangement, and, adding, a, more, symphonic, richness, and, authority, during, the, final, months, of, world, war, ii, amid, the, box, office, success, of, the, gershwin, biographical, film, rhapsody, in, blue, 1945, pianist, oscar, levant, recorded, the, now, iconic, composition, with, eugene, ormandy, s, philadelphia, orchestra, on, august, 21, 1945, levant, had, been, an, intimate, friend, of, the, deceased, composer, and, he, sought, to, replicate, gershwin, s, idiomatic, playing, style, in, his, performance, levant, s, homage, labelled, columbia, masterworks, 251, received, rapturous, reviews, and, became, one, of, the, best, selling, record, albums, of, the, year, as, a, result, of, levant, s, recording, and, the, 1945, biographical, film, about, gershwin, s, life, a, gershwin, revival, ensued, by, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, gershwin, s, rhapsody, had, become, a, predictable, staple, of, both, concert, performances, and, orchestra, recordings, consequently, more, diverse, and, irreverent, interpretations, appeared, over, time, in, summer, 1973, brazilian, jazz, rock, artist, eumir, deodato, reinterpreted, gershwin, s, rhapsody, in, an, abridged, version, that, featured, uptempo, neo, samba, rhythms, although, music, critics, derided, deodato, s, interpretation, as, mangled, and, barely, recognizable, his, single, reached, no, 41, on, the, hot, 100, and, no, 10, on, easy, listening, on, the, billboard, charts, and, no, 48, and, no, 13, respectively, in, canada, in, the, wake, of, deodato, s, earlier, reinterpretation, french, pianist, richard, clayderman, recorded, a, similarly, abridged, disco, arrangement, in, 1978, which, became, one, of, his, signature, pieces, concurrent, with, the, emergence, of, these, more, diverse, interpretations, scholarly, interest, revived, in, the, original, 1924, arrangement, by, ferde, grof, which, had, not, been, performed, since, the, end, of, the, jazz, age, on, february, 14, 1973, conductor, kenneth, kiesler, and, pianist, paul, verrette, performed, grof, s, original, arrangement, on, the, university, of, new, hampshire, campus, soon, after, conductor, michael, tilson, thomas, and, the, columbia, jazz, band, recorded, grof, s, arrangement, in, 1976, as, did, conductor, maurice, peress, with, pianist, ivan, davis, in, 1984, as, part, of, a, 60th, anniversary, reconstruction, of, the, entire, 1924, concert, one, hundred, years, after, the, debut, of, gershwin, s, rhapsody, in, 1924, tens, of, thousands, of, orchestras, as, well, as, solo, pianists, have, recorded, the, piece, both, abridged, and, unabridged, a, number, of, these, recordings, have, garnered, critical, recognition, such, as, pianist, michel, camilo, s, 2006, rendition, which, won, a, latin, grammy, award, as, a, jazz, concerto, rhapsody, in, blue, is, written, for, solo, piano, with, orchestra, a, rhapsody, differs, from, a, concerto, in, that, it, features, one, extended, movement, instead, of, separate, movements, rhapsodies, often, incorporate, passages, of, an, improvisational, nature, although, written, out, in, a, score, and, are, irregular, in, form, with, heightened, contrasts, and, emotional, exuberance, the, music, ranges, from, intensely, rhythmic, piano, solos, to, slow, broad, and, richly, orchestrated, sections, consequently, the, rhapsody, may, be, looked, upon, as, a, fantasia, with, no, strict, fidelity, to, form, the, opening, of, rhapsody, in, blue, is, written, as, a, clarinet, trill, followed, by, a, legato, 17, notes, in, a, diatonic, scale, during, a, rehearsal, whiteman, s, virtuoso, clarinetist, ross, gorman, rendered, the, upper, portion, of, the, scale, as, a, captivating, and, trombone, like, glissando, gershwin, heard, it, and, insisted, that, it, be, repeated, in, the, performance, the, effect, is, produced, using, the, tongue, and, throat, muscles, to, change, the, resonance, of, the, oral, cavity, thus, controlling, the, continuously, rising, pitch, many, clarinet, players, gradually, open, the, left, hand, tone, holes, on, their, instrument, during, the, passage, from, the, last, concert, f, to, the, top, concert, b, as, well, this, effect, has, now, become, standard, performance, practice, for, the, work, rhapsody, in, blue, features, both, rhythmic, invention, and, melodic, inspiration, and, demonstrates, gershwin, s, ability, to, write, a, piece, with, large, scale, harmonic, and, melodic, structure, the, piece, is, characterized, by, strong, motivic, inter,

appear, in, the, first, 14, measures, and, the, tag, shows, up, in, measure, 19, two, of, the, remaining, three, themes, are, rhythmically, related, to, the, first, theme, in, measure, 2, which, is, sometimes, called, the, glissando, theme, after, the, opening, glissando, in, the, clarinet, solo, or, the, ritornello, theme, the, remaining, theme, is, the, train, theme, which, is, the, first, to, appear, at, rehearsal, 9, after, the, opening, material, all, of, these, themes, rely, on, the, blues, scale, which, includes, lowered, sevenths, and, a, mixture, of, major, and, minor, thirds, each, theme, appears, both, in, orchestrated, form, and, as, a, piano, solo, there, are, considerable, differences, in, the, style, of, presentation, of, each, theme, the, harmonic, structure, of, the, rhapsody, is, more, difficult, to, analyze, the, piece, begins, and, ends, in, b, major, but, it, modulates, towards, the, sub, dominant, direction, and, abruptly, returns, to, b, major, at, the, end, the, opening, modulates, downward, through, the, keys, b, e, a, d, g, b, e, and, finally, to, a, major, modulation, through, the, circle, of, fifths, in, the, reverse, direction, inverts, classical, tonal, relationships, but, does, not, abandon, them, the, entire, middle, section, resides, primarily, in, c, major, with, forays, into, g, major, the, dominant, relation, such, modulations, occur, freely, although, not, always, with, harmonic, direction, gershwin, frequently, uses, a, recursive, harmonic, progression, of, minor, thirds, to, give, the, illusion, of, motion, when, in, fact, a, passage, does, not, change, key, from, beginning, to, end, modulation, by, thirds, is, a, common, feature, of, tin, pan, alley, music, the, influences, of, jazz, and, other, contemporary, styles, are, present, in, rhapsody, in, blue, ragtime, rhythms, are, abundant, as, is, the, cuban, clave, rhythm, which, doubles, as, a, dance, rhythm, in, the, charleston, jazz, dance, gershwin, s, own, intentions, were, to, correct, the, belief, that, jazz, had, to, be, played, strictly, in, time, so, that, one, could, dance, to, it, the, rhapsody, s, tempos, vary, widely, and, there, is, an, almost, extreme, use, of, rubato, in, many, places, throughout, the, clearest, influence, of, jazz, is, the, use, of, blue, notes, and, the, exploration, of, their, half, step, relationship, plays, a, key, role, in, the, rhapsody, the, use, of, so, called, vernacular, instruments, such, as, accordion, banjo, and, saxophones, in, the, orchestra, contribute, to, its, jazz, or, popular, style, and, the, latter, two, of, these, instruments, have, remained, part, of, grof, s, standard, orchestra, scoring, gershwin, incorporated, different, piano, styles, into, his, work, he, used, the, techniques, of, stride, piano, novelty, piano, comic, piano, and, the, song, plugger, piano, style, stride, piano, s, rhythmic, and, improvisational, style, is, evident, in, the, agitato, e, misterioso, section, which, begins, four, bars, after, rehearsal, 33, as, well, as, in, other, sections, many, of, which, include, the, orchestra, novelty, piano, can, be, heard, at, rehearsal, 9, with, the, revelation, of, the, train, theme, the, hesitations, and, light, hearted, style, of, comic, piano, a, vaudeville, approach, to, piano, made, well, known, by, chico, marx, are, evident, at, rehearsal, 22, with, the, debut, of, rhapsody, in, blue, gershwin, inaugurated, a, new, era, in, america, s, musical, history, he, established, his, reputation, as, one, of, the, eminent, composers, of, the, jazz, age, and, his, composition, eventually, became, one, of, the, most, popular, of, all, concert, works, in, the, american, heritage, magazine, frederic, d, schwarz, posits, that, the, famous, opening, clarinet, glissando, has, become, as, instantly, recognizable, to, concert, audiences, as, the, opening, of, beethoven, s, fifth, symphony, according, to, critic, orrin, howard, of, the, los, angeles, philharmonic, gershwin, s, rhapsody, made, an, indelible, mark, on, the, fraternity, of, serious, composers, and, performers, many, of, whom, were, present, at, the, premiere, and, on, gershwin, himself, for, its, enthusiastic, reception, encouraged, him, to, other, and, more, serious, projects, howard, posits, that, the, work, s, legacy, is, best, understood, as, embodying, the, cultural, zeitgeist, of, the, jazz, age, beginning, with, that, incomparable, flamboyant, clarinet, solo, rhapsody, is, irresistible, still, with, its, syncopated, rhythmic, vibrancy, its, abandoned, impudent, flair, that, tells, more, about, the, roaring, twenties, than, could, a, thousand, words, and, its, genuine, melodic, beauty, colored, a, deep, jazzy, blue, by, the, flatted, sevenths, and, thirds, that, had, their, origins, in, the, african, american, slave, songs, although, gershwin, s, rhapsody, is, by, no, means, a, definitive, example, of, jazz, in, the, jazz, age, music, historians, such, as, james, ciment, and, floyd, levin, have, similarly, concurred, that, it, is, the, key, composition, that, encapsulates, the, spirit, of, the, era, as, early, as, 1927, writer, f, scott, fitzgerald, opined, that, rhapsody, in, blue, idealized, the, youthful, zeitgeist, of, the, jazz, age, in, subsequent, decades, both, the, latter, era, and, fitzgerald, s, related, literary, works, have, been, often, culturally, linked, by, critics, and, scholars, with, gershwin, s, composition, in, 1941, social, historian, peter, quennell, opined, that, fitzgerald, s, novel, the, great, gatsby, embodied, the, sadness, and, the, remote, jauntiness, of, a, gershwin, tune, accordingly, director, baz, luhrmann, used, rhapsody, in, blue, as, a, dramatic, leitmotif, for, the, character, of, jay, gatsby, in, his, 2013, film, the, great, gatsby, a, cinematic, adaptation, of, fitzgerald, s, 1925, novel, various, writers, such, as, the, american, playwright, and, journalist, terry, teachout, have, likened, gershwin, himself, to, the, character, of, gatsby, due, to, his, attempt, to, transcend, his, lower, class, background, his, abrupt, meteoric, success, and, his, early, death, while, in, his, thirties, rhapsody, in, blue, has, been, interpreted, as, a, musical, portrait, of, early, 20th, century, new, york, city, culture, scribe, darryn, king, wrote, in, the, wall, street, journal, that, gershwin, s, fusion, of, jazz, and, classical, traditions, captures, the, thriving, melting, pot, of, jazz, age, new, york, likewise, music, historian, vince, giordano, has, opined, that, the, syncopation, the, blue, notes, the, ragtime, and, jazz, rhythms, that, gershwin, wrote, in, 1924, was, really, a, feeling, of, new, york, city, in, that, amazing, era, the, rhythm, of, the, city, seems, to, be, in, there, pianist, lang, lang, echoes, this, sentiment, when, i, hear, rhapsody, in, blue, i, see, the, empire, state, building, somehow, i, see, the, new, york, skyline, in, midtown,
