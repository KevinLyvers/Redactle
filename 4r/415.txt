seville, had, already, made, a, successful, transition, to, opera, in, a, version, by, paisiello, beaumarchais, s, mariage, de, figaro, with, its, frank, treatment, of, class, conflict, was, at, first, banned, in, vienna, emperor, joseph, ii, stated, that, since, the, piece, contains, much, that, is, objectionable, i, therefore, expect, that, the, censor, shall, either, reject, it, altogether, or, at, any, rate, have, such, alterations, made, in, it, that, he, shall, be, responsible, for, the, performance, of, this, play, and, for, the, impression, it, may, make, after, which, the, austrian, censor, duly, forbade, performing, the, german, version, of, the, play, mozart, s, librettist, managed, to, get, official, approval, from, the, emperor, for, an, operatic, version, which, eventually, achieved, great, success, the, opera, was, the, first, of, three, collaborations, between, mozart, and, da, ponte, followed, by, don, giovanni, and, cos, fan, tutte, it, was, mozart, who, originally, selected, beaumarchais, s, play, and, brought, it, to, da, ponte, who, turned, it, into, a, libretto, in, six, weeks, rewriting, it, in, poetic, italian, and, removing, all, of, the, original, s, political, references, in, particular, da, ponte, replaced, figaro, s, climactic, speech, against, inherited, nobility, with, an, equally, angry, aria, against, unfaithful,

performances, were, conducted, by, joseph, weigl, the, first, production, was, given, eight, further, performances, all, in, 1786, although, the, total, of, nine, performances, was, nothing, like, the, frequency, of, performance, of, mozart, s, later, success, the, magic, flute, which, for, months, was, performed, roughly, every, other, day, the, premiere, is, generally, judged, to, have, been, a, success, the, applause, of, the, audience, on, the, first, night, resulted, in, five, numbers, being, encored, seven, on, 8, may, emperor, joseph, in, charge, of, the, burgtheater, was, concerned, by, the, length, of, the, performance, and, directed, his, aide, count, orsini, rosenberg, as, follows, to, prevent, the, excessive, duration, of, operas, without, however, prejudicing, the, fame, often, sought, by, opera, singers, from, the, repetition, of, vocal, pieces, i, deem, the, enclosed, notice, to, the, public, that, no, piece, for, more, than, a, single, voice, is, to, be, repeated, to, be, the, most, reasonable, expedient, you, will, therefore, cause, some, posters, to, this, effect, to, be, printed, the, requested, posters, were, printed, up, and, posted, in, the, burgtheater, in, time, for, the, third, performance, on, 24, may, the, newspaper, wiener, realzeitung, carried, a, review, of, the, opera, in, its, issue, of, 11, july, 1786, it, alludes, to, interference, probably, produced, by, paid, hecklers, but, praises, the, work, warmly, mozart, s, music, was, generally, admired, by, connoisseurs, already, at, the, first, performance, if, i, except, only, those, whose, self, love, and, conceit, will, not, allow, them, to, find, merit, in, anything, not, written, by, themselves, the, public, however, did, not, really, know, on, the, first, day, where, it, stood, it, heard, many, a, bravo, from, unbiased, connoisseurs, but, obstreperous, louts, in, the, uppermost, storey, exerted, their, hired, lungs, with, all, their, might, to, deafen, singers, and, audience, alike, with, their, st, and, pst, and, consequently, opinions, were, divided, at, the, end, of, the, piece, apart, from, that, it, is, true, that, the, first, performance, was, none, of, the, best, owing, to, the, difficulties, of, the, composition, but, now, after, several, performances, one, would, be, subscribing, either, to, the, cabal, or, to, tastelessness, if, one, were, to, maintain, that, herr, mozart, s, music, is, anything, but, a, masterpiece, of, art, it, contains, so, many, beauties, and, such, a, wealth, of, ideas, as, can, be, drawn, only, from, the, source, of, innate, genius, the, hungarian, poet, ferenc, kazinczy, was, in, the, audience, for, a, may, performance, and, later, remembered, the, powerful, impression, the, work, made, on, him, storace, the, beautiful, singer, enchanted, eye, ear, and, soul, mozart, conducted, the, orchestra, playing, his, fortepiano, but, the, joy, which, this, music, causes, is, so, far, removed, from, all, sensuality, that, one, cannot, speak, of, it, where, could, words, be, found, that, are, worthy, to, describe, such, joy, joseph, haydn, appreciated, the, opera, greatly, writing, to, a, friend, that, he, heard, it, in, his, dreams, in, summer, 1790, haydn, attempted, to, produce, the, work, with, his, own, company, at, eszterh, za, but, was, prevented, from, doing, so, by, the, death, of, his, patron, nikolaus, esterh, zy, the, emperor, requested, a, special, performance, at, his, palace, theatre, in, laxenburg, which, took, place, in, june, 1786, the, opera, was, produced, in, prague, starting, in, december, 1786, by, the, pasquale, bondini, company, this, production, was, a, tremendous, success, the, newspaper, prager, oberpostamtszeitung, called, the, work, a, masterpiece, and, said, no,

for, susanna, when, the, role, was, taken, over, by, adriana, ferrarese, in, the, 1789, revival, the, replacement, arias, un, moto, di, gioia, replacing, venite, inginocchiatevi, in, act, 2, and, al, desio, di, chi, t, adora, replacing, deh, vieni, non, tardar, in, act, 4, in, which, the, two, clarinets, are, replaced, with, basset, horns, are, normally, not, used, in, modern, performances, a, notable, exception, was, a, series, of, performances, at, the, metropolitan, opera, in, 1998, with, cecilia, bartoli, as, susanna, lorenzo, da, ponte, wrote, a, preface, to, the, first, published, version, of, the, libretto, in, which, he, boldly, claimed, that, he, and, mozart, had, created, a, new, form, of, music, drama, in, spite, of, every, effort, to, be, brief, the, opera, will, not, be, one, of, the, shortest, to, have, appeared, on, our, stage, for, which, we, hope, sufficient, excuse, will, be, found, in, the, variety, of, threads, from, which, the, action, of, this, play, is, woven, the, vastness, and, grandeur, of, the, same, the, multiplicity, of, the, musical, numbers, that, had, to, be, made, in, order, not, to, leave, the, actors, too, long, unemployed, to, diminish, the, vexation, and, monotony, of, long, recitatives, and, to, express, with, varied, colours, the, various, emotions, that, occur, but, above, all, in, our, desire, to, offer, as, it, were, a, new, kind, of, spectacle, to, a, public, of, so, refined, a, taste, and, understanding, charles, rosen, in, the, classical, style, proposes, to, take, da, ponte, s, words, quite, seriously, noting, the, richness, of, the, ensemble, writing, which, carries, forward, the, action, in, a, far, more, dramatic, way, than, recitatives, would, rosen, also, suggests, that, the, musical, language, of, the, classical, style, was, adapted, by, mozart, to, convey, the, drama, many, sections, of, the, opera, resemble, sonata, form, by, movement, through, a, sequence, of, keys, they, build, up, and, resolve, musical, tension, providing, a, natural, musical, reflection, of, the, drama, as, rosen, writes, the, synthesis, of, accelerating, complexity, and, symmetrical, resolution, which, was, at, the, heart, of, mozart, s, style, enabled, him, to, find, a, musical, equivalent, for, the, great, stage, works, which, were, his, dramatic, models, the, marriage, of, figaro, in, mozart, s, version, is, the, dramatic, equal, and, in, many, respects, the, superior, of, beaumarchais, s, work, this, is, demonstrated, in, the, closing, numbers, of, all, four, acts, as, the, drama, escalates, mozart, eschews, recitativi, altogether, and, opts, for, increasingly, sophisticated, writing, bringing, his, characters, on, stage, revelling, in, a, complex, weave, of, solo, and, ensemble, singing, in, multiple, combinations, and, climaxing, in, seven, and, eight, voice, tutti, for, acts, 2, and, 4, the, finale, of, act, 2, lasting, 20, minutes, is, one, of, the, longest, uninterrupted, pieces, of, music, mozart, ever, wrote, eight, of, the, opera, s, 11, characters, appear, on, stage, in, its, more, than, 900, bars, of, continuous, music, mozart, cleverly, uses, the, sound, of, two, horns, playing, together, to, represent, cuckoldry, in, the, act, 4, aria, aprite, un, po, quegli, occhi, verdi, later, used, the, same, device, in, ford, s, aria, in, falstaff, johannes, brahms, said, in, my, opinion, each, number, in, figaro, is, a, miracle, it, is, totally, beyond, me, how, anyone, could, create, anything, so, perfect, nothing, like, it, was, ever, done, again, not, even, by, beethoven, a, musical, phrase, from, the, act, 1, trio, of, the, marriage, of, figaro, where, basilio, sings, cos, fan, tutte, le, belle, was, later, reused, by, mozart, in, the, overture, to, his, opera, cos, fan, tutte, mozart, also, quotes, figaro, s, aria, non, pi, andrai, in, the, second, act, of, his, opera, don, giovanni, further, mozart, used, it, in, 1791, in, his, five, contredanses, k, 609, no, 1, mozart, reused, the, music, of, the, agnus, dei, of, his, earlier, kr, nungsmesse, coronation, mass, for, the, countess, s, dove, sono, in, c, major, instead, of, the, original, f, major, mozart, also, reused, the, motif, that, begins, his, early, bassoon, concerto, in, another, aria, sung, by, the, countess, porgi, amor, beethoven, wrote, variations, on, se, vuol, ballare, woo, 40, for,

in, english, translating, from, beaumarchais, s, play, and, re, using, some, of, mozart, s, music, while, adding, some, of, his, own, in, his, 1991, opera, the, ghosts, of, versailles, which, includes, elements, of, beaumarchais, s, third, figaro, play, la, m, re, coupable, and, in, which, the, main, characters, of, the, marriage, of, figaro, also, appear, john, corigliano, quotes, mozart,
