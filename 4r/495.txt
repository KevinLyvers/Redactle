architect, who, was, active, also, in, bosnia, was, josip, vanca, the, authot, of, such, works, like, grand, hotel, union, 1902, 1903, or, city, savings, bank, in, ljubljana, 1902, 1903, as, well, as,

like, the, romulus, porescu, house, or, house, no, 61, on, strada, vasile, lasc, r, both, in, bucharest, this, is, because, the, style, was, somewhat, illegal, in, romanian, architecture, due, to, being, popular, in, transilvania, part, of, the, austro, hungarian, empire, at, that, time, where, romanians, were, suppressed, and, discriminated, despite, being, the, majority, of, the, population, so, the, people, who, wanted, an, art, nouveau, home, in, the, 1900s, and, early, 1910s, could, only, put, some, subtile, ornaments, reminiscent, of, the, style, while, the, rest, was, completely,

oscillate, surge, mix, and, derive, without, end, he, created, works, of, great, precision, which, sometimes, combined, gothic, with, art, nouveau, themes, also, worth, noting, are, the, uhl, brothers, from, toledo, ohio, who, set, new, standards, in, metal, furniture, production, with, their, designs, for, the, toledo, metal, furniture, co, flooded, with, european, immigrants, argentina, welcomed, all, artistic, and, architectural, european, styles, including, art, nouveau, there, was, an, environment, of, huge, investments, and, flexible, rules, for, construction, which, encouraged, young, architects, from, europe, to, come, and, grow, their, portfolio, to, later, go, back, to, europe, as, a, result, of, this, argentina, became, the, country, outside, of, europe, with, most, art, nouveau, buildings, cities, with, the, most, notable, art, nouveau, heritage, in, argentina, are, buenos, aires, rosario, and, mar, del, plata, paris, was, a, prototype, for, buenos, aires, with, the,

caballo, and, the, savoy, hotel, some, local, features, are, the, adaptation, to, the, previously, existent, chorizo, house, format, of, buildings, which, implied, a, relatively, narrow, fa, ade, for, an, actually, deep, building, inside, of, the, block, with, multiple, patios, or, holes, for, air, and, light, as, well, as, the, characteristic, cut, corners, on, every, block, that, was, a, requirement, by, law, in, buenos, aires, since, the, end, of, 1800s, material, availability, was, also, different, than, in, europe, and, buildings, will, often, be, covered, of, a, simil, piedra,

gustave, serrurier, bovy, as, in, argentina, art, nouveau, in, other, countries, was, mostly, influenced, by, foreign, artists, art, nouveau, motifs, can, also, be, found, in, french, colonial, artchitechture, throughout, french, indochina, a, notable, art, movement, called, bezalel, school, appeared, in, the, palestine, region, in, dating, to, the, late, ottoman, and, british, mandate, periods, it, has, been, described, as, a, fusion, of, oriental, art, and, jugendstil, several, artists, associated, with, the, bezalel, school, were, noted, for, their, art, nouveau, style, including, ze, ev, raban, ephraim, moses, lilien, and, abel, pann, early, art, nouveau, particularly, in, belgium, and, france, was, characterized, by, undulating, curving, forms, inspired, by, lilies, vines, flower, stems, and, other, natural, forms, used, in, particular, in, the, interiors, of, victor, horta, and, the, decoration, of, louis, majorelle, and, mile, gall, it, also, drew, upon, patterns, based, on, butterflies, and, dragonflies, borrowed, from, japanese, art, which, were, popular, in, europe, at, the, time, early, art, nouveau, also, often, featured, more, stylised, forms, expressing, movement, such, as, the, coup, de, fouet, or, whiplash, line, depicted, in, the, cyclamen, plants, drawn, by, designer, hermann, obrist, in, 1894, a, description, published, in, pan, magazine, of, hermann, obrist, s, wall, hanging, cyclamen, 1894, compared, it, to, the, sudden, violent, curves, generated, by, the, crack, of, a, whip, the, term, whiplash, though, it, was, originally, used, to, ridicule, the, style, is, frequently, applied, to, the, characteristic, curves, employed, by, art, nouveau, artists, such, decorative, undulating, and, flowing, lines, in, a, syncopated, rhythm, and, asymmetrical, shape, are, often, found, in, the, architecture, painting, sculpture, and, other, forms, of, art, nouveau, design, other, floral, forms, were, popular, inspired, by, lilies, wisteria, and, other, flowers, particularly, in, the, lamps, of, louis, comfort, tiffany, and, the, glass, objects, made, by, the, artists, of, the, school, of, nancy, and, mile, gall, other, curving, and, undulating, forms, borrowed, from, nature, included, butterflies, peacocks, swans, and, water, lilies, many, designs, depicted, women, s, hair, intertwined, with, stems, of, lilies, irises, and, other, flowers, stylised, floral, forms, were, particularly, used, by, victor, horta, in, carpets, balustrades, windows, and, furniture, they, were, also, used, extensively, by, hector, guimard, for, balustrades, and, most, famously, for, the, lamps, and, railings, at, the, entrances, of, the, paris, metro, guimard, explained, that, which, must, be, avoided, in, everything, that, is, continuous, is, the, parallel, and, symmetry, nature, is, the, greatest, builder, and, nature, makes, nothing, that, is, parallel, and, nothing, that, is, symmetrical, earlier, art, nouveau, furniture, such, as, that, made, by, louis, majorelle, and, henry, van, de, velde, was, characterized, by, the, use, of, exotic, and, expensive, materials, including, mahogany, with, inlays, of, precious, woods, and, trim, and, curving, forms, without, right, angles, it, gave, a, sensation, of, lightness, in, the, second, phase, of, art, nouveau, following, 1900, the, decoration, became, purer, and, the, lines, were, more, stylised, the, curving, lines, and, forms, evolved, into, polygons, and, then, into, cubes, and, other, geometric, forms, these, geometric, forms, were, used, with, particular, effect, in, the, architecture, and, furniture, of, joseph, maria, olbrich, otto, wagner, koloman, moser, and, josef, hoffmann, especially, the, stoclet, palace, in, brussels, which, announced, the, arrival, of, art, deco, and, modernism, another, characteristic, of, art, nouveau, architecture, was, the, use, of, light, by, opening, up, of, interior, spaces, by, the, removal, of, walls, and, the, extensive, use, of, skylights, to, bring, a, maximum, amount, of, light, into, the, interior, victor, horta, s, residence, studio, and, other, houses, built, by, him, had, extensive, skylights, supported, on, curving, iron, frames, in, the, hotel, tassel, he, removed, the, traditional, walls, around, the, stairway, so, that, the, stairs, became, a, central, element, of, the, interior, design, as, an, art, style, art, nouveau, has, affinities, with, the, pre, raphaelites, and, the, symbolist, styles, and, artists, like, aubrey, beardsley, alphonse, mucha, edward, burne, jones, gustav, klimt, and, jan, toorop, could, be, classed, in, more, than, one, of, these, styles, unlike, symbolist, painting, however, art, nouveau, has, a, distinctive, appearance, and, unlike, the, artisan, oriented, arts, and, crafts, movement, art, nouveau, artists, readily, used, new, materials, machined, surfaces, and, abstraction, in, the, service, of, pure, design, art, nouveau, did, not, eschew, the, use, of, machines, as, the, arts, and, crafts, movement, did, for, sculpture, the, principal, materials, employed, were, glass, and, wrought, iron, resulting, in, sculptural, qualities, even, in, architecture, ceramics, were, also, employed, in, creating, editions, of, sculptures, by, artists, such, as, auguste, rodin, though, his, sculpture, is, not, considered, art, nouveau, art, nouveau, architecture, made, use, of, many, technological, innovations, of, the, late, 19th, century, especially, the, use, of, exposed, iron, and, large, irregularly, shaped, pieces, of, glass, for, architecture, art, nouveau, tendencies, were, also, absorbed, into, local, styles, in, denmark, for, example, it, was, one, aspect, of, sk, nvirke, aesthetic, work, which, itself, more, closely, relates, to, the, arts, and, crafts, style, likewise, artists, adopted, many, of, the, floral, and, organic, motifs, of, art, nouveau, into, the, m, oda, polska, young, poland, style, in, poland, m, oda, polska, however, was, also, inclusive, of, other, artistic, styles, and, encompassed, a, broader, approach, to, art, literature, and, lifestyle, architecturally, art, nouveau, has, affinities, with, styles, that, although, modern, exist, outside, the, modernist, tradition, established, by, architects, like, walter, gropius, and, le, corbusier, it, is, particularly, closely, related, to, expressionist, architecture, which, shares, its, preference, for, organic, shapes, but, grew, out, of, an, intellectual, dissatisfaction, with, art, nouveau, s, approach, to, ornamentation, as, opposed, to, art, nouveau, s, focus, on, plants, and, vegetal, motifs, expressionism, takes, inspiration, from, things, like, caves, mountains, lightning, crystal, and, rock, formations, another, style, conceived, as, a, reaction, to, art, nouveau, was, art, deco, which, rejected, organic, surfaces, altogether, in, preference, for, a, rectilinear, style, derived, from, the, contemporary, artistic, avant, garde, art, nouveau, is, represented, in, painting, and, sculpture, but, it, is, most, prominent, in, architecture, and, the, decorative, arts, it, was, well, suited, to, the, graphic, arts, especially, the, poster, interior, design, metal, and, glass, art, jewellery, furniture, design, ceramics, and, textiles, the, graphic, arts, flourished, in, the, art, nouveau, period, thanks, to, new, technologies, of, printing, particularly, colour, lithography, which, allowed, the, mass, production, of, colour, posters, art, was, no, longer, confined, to, galleries, museums, and, salons, it, could, be, found, on, paris, walls, and, in, illustrated, art, magazines, which, circulated, throughout, europe, and, to, the, united, states, the, most, popular, theme, of, art, nouveau, posters, was, women, women, symbolizing, glamour, modernity, and, beauty, often, surrounded, by, flowers, in, britain, the, leading, graphic, artist, in, the, art, nouveau, style, was, aubrey, beardsley, 1872, 1898, he, began, with, engraved, book, illustrations, for, le, morte, d, arthur, then, black, and, white, illustrations, for, salome, by, oscar, wilde, 1893, which, brought, him, fame, in, the, same, year, he, began, engraving, illustrations, and, posters, for, the, art, magazine, the, studio, which, helped, publicize, european, artists, such, as, fernand, khnopff, in, britain, the, curving, lines, and, intricate, floral, patterns, attracted, as, much, attention, as, the, text, the, swiss, french, artist, eug, ne, grasset, 1845, 1917, was, one, of, the, first, creators, of, french, art, nouveau, posters, he, helped, decorate, the, famous, cabaret, le, chat, noir, in, 1885, and, made, his, first, posters, for, the, f, tes, de, paris, he, made, a, celebrated, poster, of, sarah, bernhardt, in, 1890, and, a, wide, variety, of, book, illustrations, the, artist, designers, jules, ch, ret, georges, de, feure, and, the, painter, henri, de, toulouse, lautrec, all, made, posters, for, paris, theaters, caf, s, dance, halls, cabarets, the, czech, artist, alphonse, mucha, 1860, 1939, arrived, in, paris, in, 1888, and, in, 1895, made, a, poster, for, actress, sarah, bernhardt, in, the, play, gismonda, by, victorien, sardou, the, success, of, this, poster, led, to, a, contract, to, produce, posters, for, six, more, plays, by, bernhardt, over, the, next, four, years, he, also, designed, sets, costumes, and, even, jewellery, for, the, actress, based, on, the, success, of, his, theater, posters, mucha, made, posters, for, a, variety, of, products, ranging, from, cigarettes, and, soap, to, beer, biscuits, all, featuring, an, idealized, female, figure, with, an, hourglass, figure, he, went, on, to, design, products, from, jewellery, to, biscuit, boxes, in, his, distinctive, style, in, vienna, the, most, prolific, designer, of, graphics, and, posters, was, koloman, moser, 1868, 1918, who, actively, participated, in, the, secession, movement, with, gustav, klimt, and, josef, hoffmann, and, made, illustrations, and, covers, for, the, magazine, of, the, movement, ver, sacrum, as, well, as, paintings, furniture, and, decoration, painting, was, another, domain, of, art, nouveau, though, most, painters, associated, with, art, nouveau, are, primarily, described, as, members, of, other, movements, particularly, post, impressionism, and, symbolism, alphonse, mucha, was, famous, for, his, art, nouveau, posters, which, frustrated, him, according, to, his, son, and, biographer, ji, mucha, he, did, not, think, much, of, art, nouveau, what, is, it, art, nouveau, he, asked, art, can, never, be, new, he, took, the, greatest, pride, in, his, work, as, a, history, painter, his, art, nouveau, inspired, painting, slava, is, a, portrait, of, the, daughter, of, his, patron, in, slavic, costume, which, was, modelled, after, his, theatrical, posters, the, painters, most, closely, associated, with, art, nouveau, were, les, nabis, post, impressionist, artists, who, were, active, in, paris, from, 1888, until, 1900, one, of, their, stated, goals, was, to, break, down, the, barrier, between, the, fine, arts, and, the, decorative, arts, they, painted, not, only, canvases, but, also, decorative, screens, and, panels, many, of, their, works, were, influenced, by, the, aesthetics, of, japanese, prints, the, members, included, pierre, bonnard, maurice, denis, paul, ranson, douard, vuillard, ker, xavier, roussel, f, lix, vallotton, and, paul, s, rusier, the, austrian, painter, gustav, klimt, was, an, exponent, of, art, nouveau, painting, and, more, specifically, a, representative, of, the, modernist, movement, of, the, viennese, secession, klimt, painted, canvases, and, murals, in, an, ornate, personal, style, which, he, also, expressed, through, handicrafts, such, as, those, found, in, the, viennese, secession, gallery, klimt, found, one, of, his, most, recurring, sources, of, inspiration, in, the, female, nude, his, works, are, sensual, with, a, naturalistic, individual, organic, style, inspired, by, nature, following, the, decorative, style, of, gaud, the, catalan, modernist, painters, ram, n, casas, santiago, rusi, ol, aleix, clap, s, joaquim, sunyer, hermenegildo, anglada,

murals, by, gustav, klimt, were, integrated, into, decorative, scheme, of, josef, hoffmann, for, the, stoclet, palace, 1905, 1911, the, klimt, mural, for, the, dining, room, at, the, stoclet, palace, is, considered, a, masterpiece, of, late, art, nouveau, one, subject, did, appear, both, in, traditional, painting, and, art, nouveau, the, american, dancer, loie, fuller, was, portrayed, by, french, and, austrian, painters, and, poster, artists, one, particular, style, that, became, popular, in, the, art, nouveau, period, especially, in, brussels, was, sgraffito, a, technique, invented, in, the, renaissance, of, applying, layers, of, tinted, plaster, to, make, murals, on, the, fa, ades, of, houses, this, was, used, in, particular, by, belgian, architect, paul, hankar, for, the, houses, he, built, for, two, artist, friends, paul, cauchie, and, albert, ciamberlani, glass, art, was, a, medium, in, which, art, nouveau, found, new, and, varied, ways, of, expression, intense, amount, of, experimentation, went, on, particularly, in, france, to, find, new, effects, of, transparency, and, opacity, in, engraving, win, cameo, double, layers, and, acid, engraving, a, technique, that, permitted, production, in, series, the, city, of, nancy, became, an, important, centre, for, the, french, glass, industry, and, the, workshops, of, mile, gall, and, the, daum, studio, led, by,

method, of, incrusting, glass, by, pressing, fragments, of, different, coloured, glass, into, the, unfinished, piece, they, often, collaborated, with, the, furniture, designer, louis, majorelle, whose, home, and, workshops, were, in, nancy, another, feature, of, art, nouveau, was, the, use, of, stained, glass, windows, with, that, style, of, floral, themes, in, residential, salons,

k, pping, who, used, blown, glass, to, create, extremely, delicate, glasses, in, the, form, of, flowers, so, delicate, that, few, survive, today, in, vienna, the, glass, designs, of, the, secession, movement, were, much, more, geometrical, than, those, of, france, or, belgium, otto, prutscher, was, the, most, rigorous, glass, designer, of, the, movement, in, britain, a, number, of, floral, stained, glass, designs, were, created, by, margaret, macdonald, mackintosh, for, the, architectural, display, called, the, house, of, an, art, lover, in, the, united, states, louis, comfort, tiffany,

world, s, columbian, exposition, in, chicago, in, 1893, where, tiffany, displayed, his, lamps, in, a, byzantine, like, chapel, tiffany, experimented, extensively, with, the, processes, of, colouring, glass, patenting, in, 1894, the, process, favrile, glass, which, used, metallic, oxides, to, colour, the, interior, of, the, molten, glass, giving, it, an, iridescent, effect, his, workshops,

concealing, the, iron, frameworks, of, modern, buildings, but, art, nouveau, architects, victor, horta, and, hector, guimard, went, a, step, further, they, added, iron, decoration, in, curves, inspired, by, floral, and, vegetal, forms, both, in, the, interiors, and, exteriors, of, their, buildings, they, took, the, form, of, stairway, railings, in, the, interior, light, fixtures, and, other, details, in, the, interior, and, balconies, and, other, ornaments, on, the, exterior, these, became, some, of, the, most, distinctive, features, of, art, nouveau, architecture, the, use, of,

continental, designs, were, usually, very, complex, with, curving, shapes, that, were, expensive, to, make, it, also, had, the, drawback, that, the, owner, of, the, home, could, not, change, the, furniture, or, add, pieces, in, a, different, style, without, disrupting, the, entire, effect, of, the, room, for, this, reason, when, art, nouveau, architecture, went, out, of, style, the, style, of, furniture, also, largely, disappeared, in, france, the, centre, for, furniture, design, and, manufacture, was, in, nancy, where, two, major, designers, mile, gall, and, louis, majorelle, had, their,

english, arts, and, crafts, movement, with, more, geometric, rational, forms, in, britain, the, furniture, of, charles, rennie, mackintosh, was, purely, arts, and, crafts, austere, and, geometrical, with, long, straight, lines, and, right, angles, and, a, minimum, of, decoration, continental, designs, were, much, more, elaborate, often, using, curved, shapes, both, in, the, basic, shapes, of, the, piece, and, in, applied, decorative, motifs, in, germany, the, furniture, of, peter, behrens, and, the, jugendstil, was, largely, rationalist, with, geometric, straight, lines, and, some, decoration, attached, to, the, surface, their, goal, was, exactly, the, opposite, of, french, art, nouveau, simplicity, of, structure, and, simplicity, of, materials, for, furniture, that, could, be, inexpensive, and, easily, mass, manufactured, the, same, was, true, for, the, furniture, of, designers, of, the, wiener, werkst, tte, in, vienna, led, by, otto, wagner, josef, hoffmann, josef, maria, olbrich, and, koloman, moser, the, furniture, was, geometric, and, had, a, minimum, of, decoration, though, in, style, it, often, followed, national, historic, precedent, particularly, the,

and, crafts, movement, or, by, historic, american, models, than, by, the, art, nouveau, one, designer, who, did, introduce, art, nouveau, themes, was, charles, rohlfs, in, buffalo, n, y, whose, designs, for, american, white, oak, furniture, were, influenced, by, motifs, of, celtic, art, and, gothic, art, with, touches, of, art, nouveau, in, the, metal, trim, applied, to, the, pieces,

of, the, russian, abramtsevo, colony, especially, those, by, mikhail, vrubel, textiles, and, wallpapers, were, an, important, vehicle, of, art, nouveau, from, the, beginning, of, the, style, and, an, essential, element, of, art, nouveau, interior, design, in, britain, the, textile, designs, of, william, morris, had, helped, launch, the, arts, and, crafts, movement, and, then, art, nouveau, many, designs, were, created, for, the, liberty, department, store, in, london, which, popularized, the, style, throughout, europe, one, such, designer, was, the, silver, studio, which, provided, colourful, stylised, floral, patterns, other, distinctive, designs, came, from, glasgow, school, and, margaret, macdonald, mackintosh, the, glasgow, school, introduced, several, distinctive, motifs, including, stylised, eggs, geometric, forms, and, the, rose, of, glasgow, in, france, a, major, contribution, was, made, by, designer, eug, ne, grasset, who, in, 1896, published, la, plante, et, ses, applications, ornamentales, suggesting, art, nouveau, designs, based, on, different, flowers, and, plants, many, patterns, were, designed, for, and, produced, by, for, the, major, french, textile,

have, museum, status, but, can, be, officially, visited, for, a, fee, or, unofficially, for, free, e, g, railway, stations, churches, cafes, restaurants, pubs, hotels, stores, offices, libraries, cemeteries, fountains, as, well, as, numerous, apartment, buildings, that, are, still, inhabited, criticized, for, its, primitive, extravagances, art, nouveau, started, to, fade, away, after, 1911, in, histories, of, european, architecture, in, the, 20th, century, from, the, 1930s, to, the, 1950s, influential, historians, like, nikolaus, pevsner, sigfried, giedion, and, henry, russell, hitchcock, did, not, take, art, nouveau, into, consideration, this, left, the, first, versions, of, pevsner, s, the, genius, of, european, architecture, without, a, mention, of, hector, guimard, or, antoni, gaud, the, first, major, works, dealing, with, art, nouveau, were, published, at, the, end, of, the, 1950s, with, johnny, watser, art, nouveau, was, one, of, the, factors, that, led, to, art, deco, a, style, created, as, a, collective, effort, of, multiple, french, designers, to, create, a, new, modern, style, around, 1910, this, is, because, art, nouveau, broke, the, supremacy, of, 19th, century, revivalism, and, eclecticism, opposing, academic, conventions, through, its, various, manifestations, it, invented, new, ornamental, systems, no, longer, dependent, on, historical, formulae, through, curvy, plant, forms, in, most, of, the, world, geometric, decoration, in, austria, hungary, and, the, uk, and, reinterpretations, of, national, tradition, in, the, countries, of, northern, central, and, eastern, europe, the, idea, of, creating, a, new, style, with, new, ornaments, and, shapes, was, a, significant, contribution, that, art, nouveau, brought, to, the, invention, of, art, deco, another, aspect, taken, from, art, nouveau, is, the, emphasis, put, on, domestic, luxury, some, of, the, fine, details, and, sinuous, lines, of, art, nouveau, are, also, found, in, art, deco, architecture, and, design, of, the, 1920s, but, slightly, simplified, similarly, the, flat, colours, and, visible, outlines, popularized, by, art, nouveau, posters, are, very, often, used, in, art, deco, illustration, compared, to, many, art, nouveau, designs, where, the, vegetal, motifs, seem, to, grow, and, morph, on, the, object, or, architectural, ornament, most, art, deco, works, have, a, clear, compositional, structure, similar, to, neoclassicism, aside, from, ideas, taken, from, franco, belgian, art, nouveau, influence, came, also, from, the, geometric, motifs, and, volumes, found, in, the, uk, and, vienna, the, flowers, spirals, and, squares, found, here, are, very, similar, to, the, ones, found, in, art, deco, charles, rennie, mackintosh, even, anticipated, art, deco, forms, in, his, later, creations, one, of, the, secessionist, works, that, best, anticipates, the, style, is, the, stoclet, palace, in, brussels, with, its, ziggurat, shaped, setbacks, the, vertical, slit, of, the, staircase, window, and, the, overall, simplicity, and, modest, ornamentation, during, the, 1960s, postmodernism, was, born, this, was, and, is, a, movement, that, questions, modernism, the, status, quo, after, world, war, ii, and, promoted, the, inclusion, and, reinterpretation, of, elements, of, historic, styles, in, new, designs, although, several, international, exhibitions, on, art, nouveau, happened, in, the, 1950s, a, successful, revival, appeared, in, the, 1960s, and, especially, in, the, 1970s, with, the, rise, of, postmodernism, aside, from, exhibitions, this, revival, might, be, connected, with, the, flower, power, generation, that, set, the, tone, at, the, time, recognized, its, own, life, ideals, in, the, floral, ornament, and, the, erotically, emancipated, art, themes, of, the, years, around, 1900, art, nouveau, was, also, one, of, the, main, sources, of, inspiration, for, many, posters, of, psychedelic, rock, from, the, same, period, leading, proponents, of, the, 1960s, psychedelic, art, movement, were, san, francisco, poster, artists, such, as, rick, griffin, victor, moscoso, bonnie, maclean, stanley, mouse, alton, kelley, and, wes, wilson, compared, to, the, earthy, colours, that, characterize, art, nouveau, these, posters, had, highly, saturated, colours, put, in, contrast, and, also, highly, stylised, text, sometimes, hard, to, read, this, style, flourished, from, about, 1966, to, 1972, on, the, downside, gustav, klimt, s, iconic, paintings, are, found, today, on, many, kitschy, souvenirs, mugs, plates, napkins, key, chains, and, so, on, this, is, problematic, as, one, of, the, definitions, of, kitsch, is, reproduction, or, copying, on, an, industrial, scale, of, works, of, art, multiplied, and, exploited, commercially, the, kiss, had, been, printed, on, countless, sizes, and, materials, in, a, similar, situation, are, alphonse, mucha, s, posters, one, of, the, artists, who, found, in, art, nouveau, a, major, source, of, inspiration, was, the, austrian, painter, and, architect, friedensreich, hundertwasser, he, took, inspiration, from, multiple, sources, including, egon, schiele, baroque, and, persian, miniature, and, the, curvy, ornamentation, of, art, nouveau
