there, is, usually, a, resonant, head, on, the, underside, of, the, drum, other, techniques, have, been, used, to, cause, drums, to, make, sound, such, as, the, thumb, roll, drums, are, the, world, s, oldest, and, most, ubiquitous, musical, instruments, and, the, basic, design, has, remained, virtually, unchanged, for, thousands, of, years, drums, may, be, played, individually, with, the, player, using, a, single, drum, and, some, drums, such, as, the, djembe, are, almost, always, played, in, this, way, others, are, normally, played, in, a, set, of, two, or, more, all, played, by, one, player, such, as, bongo, drums, and, timpani, a, number, of, different, drums, together, with, cymbals, form, the, basic, modern, drum, kit, drums, are, usually, played, by, striking, with, the, hand, a, beater, attached, to, a, pedal, or, with, one, or, two, sticks, with, or, without, padding, a, wide, variety, of, sticks, are, used, including, wooden, sticks, and, sticks, with, soft, beaters, of, felt, on, the, end, in, jazz, some, drummers, use, brushes, for, a, smoother, quieter, sound, in, many, traditional, cultures, drums, have, a, symbolic, function, and, are, used, in, religious, ceremonies, drums, are, often, used, in, music, therapy, especially, hand, drums, because, of, their, tactile, nature, and, easy, use, by, a, wide, variety, of, people, in, the, 2000s, drums, have, also, been, used, as, a, way, to, engage, in, aerobic, exercise, and, is, called, cardio, drumming, in, popular, music, and, jazz, drums, usually, refers, to, a, drum, kit, or, a, set, of, drums, with, some, cymbals, or, in, the, case, of, harder, rock, music, genres, many, cymbals, and, drummer, to, the, person, who, plays, them, drums, acquired, even, divine, status, in, places, such, as, burundi, where, the, karyenda, was, a, symbol, of, the, power, of, the, king, the, shell, almost, always, has, a, circular, opening, over, which, the, drumhead, is, stretched, but, the, shape, of, the, remainder, of, the, shell, varies, widely, in, the, western, musical, tradition, the, most, usual, shape, is, a, cylinder, although, timpani, for, example, use, bowl, shaped, shells, other, shapes, include, a, frame, design, tar, bodhr, n, truncated, cones, bongo, drums, ashiko, goblet, shaped, djembe, and, joined, truncated, cones, talking, drum, a, drum, contains, cylindrical, shells, can, be, open, at, one, end, as, is, the, case, with, timbales, or, can, have, two, drum, heads, one, head, on, each, end, single, headed, drums, typically, consist, of, a, skin, stretched, over, an, enclosed, space, or, over, one, of, the, ends, of, a, hollow, vessel, drums, with, two, heads, covering, both, ends, of, a, cylindrical, shell, often, have, a, small, hole, somewhat, halfway, between, the, two, heads, the, shell, forms, a, resonating, chamber, for, the, resulting, sound, exceptions, include, the, african, slit, drum, also, known, as, a, log, drum, as, it, is, made, from, a, hollowed, out, tree, trunk, and, the, caribbean, steel, drum, made, from, a, metal, barrel, drums, with, two, heads, can, also, have, a, set, of, wires, called, snares, held, across, the, bottom, head, top, head, or, both, heads, hence, the, name, snare, drum, on, some, drums, with, two, heads, a, hole, or, bass, reflex, port, may, be, cut, or, installed, onto, one, head, as, with, some, 2010s, era, bass, drums, in, rock, music, on, modern, band, and, orchestral, drums, the, drumhead, is, placed, over, the, opening, of, the, drum, which, in, turn, is, held, onto, the, shell, by, a, counterhoop, or, rim, which, is, then, held, by, means, of, a, number, of, tuning, screws, called, tension, rods, that, screw, into, lugs, placed, evenly, around, the, circumference, the, head, s, tension, can, be, adjusted, by, loosening, or, tightening, the, rods, many, such, drums, have, six, to, ten, tension, rods, the, sound, of, a, drum, depends, on, many, variables, including, shape, shell, size, and, thickness, shell, materials, counterhoop, material, drumhead, material, drumhead, tension, drum, position, location, and, striking, velocity, and, angle, prior, to, the, invention, of, tension, rods, drum, skins, were, attached, and, tuned, by, rope, systems, as, on, the, djembe, or, pegs, and, ropes, such, as, on, ewe, drums, these, methods, are, rarely, used, today, though, sometimes, appear, on, regimental, marching, band, snare, drums, the, head, of, a, talking, drum, for, example, can, be, temporarily, tightened, by, squeezing, the, ropes, that, connect, the, top, and, bottom, heads, similarly, the, tabla, is, tuned, by, hammering, a, disc, held, in, place, around, the, drum, by, ropes, stretching, from, the, top, to, bottom, head, orchestral, timpani, can, be, quickly, tuned, to, precise, pitches, by, using, a, foot, pedal, several, factors, determine, the, sound, a, drum, produces, including, the, type, shape, and, construction, of, the, drum, shell, the, type, of, drum, heads, it, has, and, the, tension, of, these, drumheads, different, drum, sounds, have, different, uses, in, music, for, example, the, modern, tom, tom, drum, a, jazz, drummer, may, want, drums, that, are, high, pitched, resonant, and, quiet, whereas, a, rock, drummer, may, prefer, drums, that, are, loud, dry, and, low, pitched, the, drum, head, has, the, most, effect, on, how, a, drum, sounds, each, type, of, drum, head, serves, its, own, musical, purpose, and, has, its, own, unique, sound, double, ply, drumheads, dampen, high, frequency, harmonics, because, they, are, heavier, and, they, are, suited, to, heavy, playing, drum, heads, with, a, white, textured, coating, on, them, muffle, the, overtones, of, the, drum, head, slightly, producing, a, less, diverse, pitch, drum, heads, with, central, silver, or, black, dots, tend, to, muffle, the, overtones, even, more, while, drum, heads, with, perimeter, sound, rings, mostly, eliminate, overtones, some, jazz, drummers, avoid, using, thick, drum, heads, preferring, single, ply, drum, heads, or, drum, heads, with, no, muffling, rock, drummers, often, prefer, the, thicker, or, coated, drum, heads, the, second, biggest, factor, that, affects, drum, sound, is, head, tension, against, the, shell, when, the, hoop, is, placed, around, the, drum, head, and, shell, and, tightened, down, with, tension, rods, the, tension, of, the, head, can, be, adjusted, when, the, tension, is, increased, the, amplitude, of, the, sound, is, reduced, and, the, frequency, is, increased, making, the, pitch, higher, and, the, volume, lower, the, type, of, shell, also, affects, the, sound, of, a, drum, because, the, vibrations, resonate, in, the, shell, of, the, drum, the, shell, can, be, used, to, increase, the, volume, and, to, manipulate, the, type, of, sound, produced, the, larger, the, diameter, of, the, shell, the, lower, the, pitch, the, larger, the, depth, of, the, drum, the, louder, the, volume, shell, thickness, also, determines, the, volume, of, drums, thicker, shells, produce, louder, drums, mahogany, raises, the, frequency, of, low, pitches, and, keeps, higher, frequencies, at, about, the, same, speed, when, choosing, a, set, of, shells, a, jazz, drummer, may, want, smaller, maple, shells, while, a, rock, drummer, may, want, larger, birch, shells, drums, made, with, alligator, skins, have, been, found, in, neolithic, cultures, located, in, china, dating, to, a, period, of, 5500, 2350, bc, in, literary, records, drums, manifested, shamanistic, characteristics, and, were,

macaque, monkeys, drum, objects, in, a, rhythmic, way, to, show, social, dominance, and, this, has, been, shown, to, be, processed, in, a, similar, way, in, their, brains, to, vocalizations, suggesting, an, evolutionary, origin, to, drumming, as, part, of, social, communication, other, primates, including, gorillas, make, drumming, sounds, by, chest, beating, or, hand, clapping, and, rodents, such, as, kangaroo, rats, also, make, similar, sounds, using, their, paws, on, the, ground, drums, are, used, not, only, for, their, musical, qualities, but, also, as, a, means, of, communication, over, great, distances, the, talking, drums, of, africa, are, used, to, imitate, the, tone, patterns, of, spoken, language, throughout, sri, lankan, history, drums, have, been, used, for, communication, between, the, state, and, the, community, and, sri, lankan, drums, have, a, history, stretching, back, over, 2500, years, drumming, may, be, a, purposeful, expression, of, emotion, for, entertainment, spiritualism, and, communication, many, cultures, practice, drumming, as, a, spiritual, or, religious, passage, and, interpret, drummed, rhythm, similarly, to, spoken, language,

dance, as, a, discipline, drumming, concentrates, on, training, the, body, to, punctuate, convey, and, interpret, musical, rhythmic, intention, to, an, audience, and, to, the, performer, chinese, troops, used, t, ig, drums, to, motivate, troops, to, help, set, a, marching, pace, and, to, call, out, orders, or, announcements, for, example, during, a, war, between, qi, and, lu, in, 684, bc, the, effect, of, drum, on, soldiers, morale, is, employed, to, change, the, result, of, a, major, battle, fife, and, drum, corps, of, swiss, mercenary, foot, soldiers, also, used, drums, they, used, an, early, version, of, the, snare, drum, carried, over, the, player, s, right, shoulder, suspended, by, a, strap, typically, played, with, one, hand, using, traditional, grip, it, is, to, this, instrument, that, the, english, word, drum, was, first, used, similarly, during, the, english, civil, war, rope, tension, drums, would, be, carried, by, junior, officers, as, a, means, to, relay,
