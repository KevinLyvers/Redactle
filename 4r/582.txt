manuscript, and, celtic, gospel, book, in, latin, containing, the, four, gospels, of, the, new, testament, together, with, various, prefatory, texts, and, tables, it, was, created, in, a, columban, monastery, in, either, ireland, or, scotland, and, may, have, had, contributions, from, various, columban, institutions, from, each, of, these, areas, it, is, believed, to, have, been, created, c, 800, ad, the, text, of, the, gospels, is, largely, drawn, from, the, vulgate, although, it, also, includes, several, passages, drawn, from, the, earlier, versions, of, the, bible, known, as, the, vetus, latina, it, is, regarded, as, a, masterwork, of, western, calligraphy, and, the, pinnacle, of, insular, illumination, the, manuscript, takes, its, name, from, the, abbey, of, kells, county, meath, which, was, its, home, for, centuries, the, illustrations, and, ornamentation, of, the, book, of, kells, surpass, those, of, other, insular, gospel, books, in, extravagance, and, complexity, the, decoration, combines, traditional, christian, iconography, with, the, ornate, swirling, motifs, typical, of, insular, art, figures, of, humans, animals, and, mythical, beasts, together, with, celtic, knots, and, interlacing, patterns, in, vibrant, colours, enliven, the, manuscript, s, pages, many, of, these, minor, decorative, elements, are, imbued, with, christian, symbolism, and, so, further, emphasise, the, themes, of, the, major, illustrations, the, manuscript, today, comprises, 340, leaves, or, folios, the, recto, and, verso, of, each, leaf, total, 680, pages, since, 1953, it, has, been, bound, in, four, volumes, 330, mm, by, 250, mm, 13, inches, by, 9, 8, inches, the, leaves, are, high, quality, calf, vellum, the, unprecedentedly, elaborate, ornamentation, that, covers, them, includes, ten, full, page, illustrations, and, text, pages, that, are, vibrant, with, decorated, initials, and, interlinear, miniatures, marking, the, furthest, extension, of, the, anti, classical, and, energetic, qualities, of, insular, art, the, insular, majuscule, script, of, the, text, appears, to, be, the, work, of, at, least, three, different, scribes, the, lettering, is, in, iron, gall, ink, and, the, colours, used, were, derived, from, a, wide, range, of, substances, some, of, which, were, imported, from, distant, lands, the, manuscript, is, on, display, to, visitors, in, trinity, college, library, dublin, and, shows, two, pages, at, any, one, time, rotated, every, 12, weeks, a, digitised, version, of, the, entire, manuscript, may, also, be, seen, online, the, book, of, kells, is, one, of, the, finest, and, most, famous, and, also, one, of, the, latest, of, a, group, of, manuscripts, in, what, is, known, as, the, insular, style, produced, from, the, late, 6th, through, the, early, 9th, centuries, in, monasteries, in, ireland, scotland, and, england, and, in, continental, monasteries, with, hiberno, scottish, or, anglo, saxon, foundations, these, manuscripts, include, the, cathach, of, st, columba, the, ambrosiana, orosius, fragmentary, gospel, in, the, durham, dean, and, chapter, library, all, from, the, early, 7th, century, and, the, book, of, durrow, from, the, second, half, of, the, 7th, century, from, the, early, 8th, century, come, the, durham, gospels, the, echternach, gospels, the, lindisfarne, gospels, see, illustration, at, right, and, the, lichfield, gospels, among, others, the, st, gall, gospel, book, belongs, to, the, late, 8th, century, and, the, book, of, armagh, dated, to, 807, 809, to, the, early, 9th, century, scholars, place, these, manuscripts, together, based, on, similarities, in, artistic, style, script, and, textual, traditions, the, fully, developed, style, of, the, ornamentation, of, the, book, of, kells, places, it, late, in, this, series, either, from, the, late, 8th, or, early, 9th, century, the, book, of, kells, follows, many, of, the, iconographic, and, stylistic, traditions, found, in, these, earlier, manuscripts, for, example, the, form, of, the, decorated, letters, found, in, the, incipit, pages, for, the, gospels, is, surprisingly, consistent, in, insular, gospels, compare, for, example, the, incipit, pages, of, the, gospel, of, matthew, in, the, lindisfarne, gospels, and, in, the, book, of, kells, both, of, which, feature, intricate, decorative, knotwork, patterns, inside, the, outlines, formed, by, the, enlarged, initial, letters, of, the, text, for, a, more, complete, list, of, related, manuscripts, see, list, of, hiberno, saxon, illustrated, manuscripts, the, abbey, of, kells, in, kells, county, meath, had, been, founded, or, refounded, from, iona, abbey, construction, taking, from, 807, until, the, consecration, of, the, church, in, 814, the, manuscript, s, date, and, place, of, production, have, been, subjects, of, considerable, debate, traditionally, the, book, was, thought, to, have, been, created, in, the, time, of, columba, possibly, even, as, the, work, of, his, own, hands, this, tradition, has, long, been, discredited, on, paleographic, and, stylistic, grounds, most, evidence, points, to, a, composition, date, c, 800, long, after, st, columba, s, death, in, 597, the, proposed, dating, in, the, 9th, century, coincides, with, viking, raids, on, lindisfarne, and, iona, which, began, c, 793, 794, and, eventually, dispersed, the, monks, and, their, holy, relics, into, ireland, and, scotland, there, is, another, tradition, with, some, traction, among, irish, scholars, that, suggests, the, manuscript, was, created, for, the, 200th, anniversary, of, the, saint, s, death, alternatively, as, is, thought, possible, for, the, northumbrian, lindisfarne, gospels, and, also, the, st, cuthbert, gospel, both, with, saint, cuthbert, it, may, have, been, produced, to, mark, the, translation, or, moving, of, columba, s, remains, into, a, shrine, reliquary, which, probably, had, taken, place, by, the, 750s, there, are, at, least, four, competing, theories, about, the, manuscript, s, place, of, origin, and, time, of, completion, first, the, book, or, perhaps, just, the, text, may, have, been, created, at, iona, and, then, completed, in, kells, second, the, book, may, have, been, produced, entirely, at, iona, third, the, manuscript, may, have, been, produced, entirely, in, the, scriptorium, at, kells, finally, it, may, have, been, the, product, of, dunkeld, or, another, monastery, in, pictish, scotland, though, there, is, no, actual, evidence, for, this, theory, especially, considering, the, absence, of, any, surviving, manuscript, from, pictland, although, the, question, of, the, exact, location, of, the, book, s, production, will, probably, never, be, answered, conclusively, the, first, theory, that, it, was, begun, at, iona, and, continued, at, kells, is, widely, accepted, regardless, of, which, theory, is, true, it, is, certain, that, the, book, of, kells, was, produced, by, columban, monks, closely, associated, with, the, community, at, iona, the, historical, circumstances, which, informed, the, book, of, kells, production, were, the, preservation, of, the, latin, language, after, the, fall, of, the, roman, empire, and, the, establishment, of, monastic, life, which, entailed, the, production, of, texts, cassiodorus, in, particular, advocated, both, practices, having, founded, the, monastery, vivarium, in, the, sixth, century, and, having, written, institutiones, a, work, which, describes, and, recommends, several, texts, both, religious, and, secular, for, study, by, monks, vivarium, included, a, scriptorium, for, the, reproduction, of, books, in, both, genres, later, the, carolingian, period, introduced, the, innovation, of, copying, texts, onto, vellum, a, material, much, more, durable, than, the, papyrus, to, which, many, ancient, writings, had, been, committed, gradually, these, traditions, spread, throughout, the, european, continent, and, finally, to, the, british, isles, kells, abbey, was, pillaged, by, vikings, many, times, at, the, beginning, of, the, 9th, century, and, how, the, book, survived, is, not, known, the, earliest, historical, reference, to, the, book, and, indeed, to, the, book, s, presence, at, kells, can, be, found, in, a, 1007, entry, in, the, annals, of, ulster, this, entry, records, that, the, great, gospel, of, columkille, the, chief, relic, of, the, western, world, was, wickedly, stolen, during, the, night, from, the, western, sacristy, of, the, great, stone, church, at, cenannas, on, account, of, its, wrought, shrine, the, manuscript, was, recovered, a, few, months, later, minus, its, golden, and, bejewelled, cover, under, a, sod, it, is, generally, assumed, that, the, great, gospel, of, columkille, is, the, book, of, kells, if, this, is, correct, then, the, book, was, in, kells, by, 1007, and, had, been, there, long, enough, for, thieves, to, learn, of, its, presence, the, force, of, ripping, the, manuscript, free, from, its, cover, may, account, for, the, folios, missing, from, the, beginning, and, end, of, the, book, of, kells, the, description, in, the, annals, of, the, book, as, of, columkille, that, is, having, belonged, to, and, perhaps, being, made, by, columba, suggests, that, the, book, was, believed, at, that, time, to, have, been, made, on, iona, regardless, the, book, was, certainly, at, kells, in, the, 12th, century, when, land, charters, pertaining, to, the, abbey, of, kells, were, copied, onto, some, of, its, blank, pages, the, practice, of, copying, charters, into, important, books, was, widespread, in, the, medieval, period, and, such, inscriptions, in, the, book, of, kells, provide, concrete, evidence, about, its, location, at, the, time, the, abbey, of, kells, was, dissolved, because, of, the, ecclesiastical, reforms, of, the, 12th, century, the, abbey, church, was, converted, to, a, parish, church, in, which, the, book, of, kells, remained, the, 12th, century, writer, gerald, of, wales, in, his, topographia, hibernica, described, seeing, a, great, gospel, book, in, kildare, which, many, have, since, assumed, was, the, book, of, kells, the, description, certainly, matches, kells, this, book, contains, the, harmony, of, the, four, evangelists, according, to, jerome, where, for, almost, every, page, there, are, different, designs, and, other, forms, almost, infinite, fine, craftsmanship, is, all, about, you, but, you, might, not, notice, it, look, more, keenly, at, it, and, you, will, penetrate, to, the, very, shrine, of, art, you, will, make, out, intricacies, so, delicate, and, subtle, so, exact, and, compact, so, full, of, knots, and, links, with, colours, so, fresh, and, vivid, that, you, might, say, that, all, this, was, the, work, of, an, angel, and, not, of, a, man, since, gerald, claims, to, have, seen, this, book, in, kildare, he, may, have, seen, another, now, lost, book, equal, in, quality, to, the, book, of, kells, or, he, may, have, misstated, his, location, the, book, of, kells, remained, in, kells, until, 1654, in, that, year, cromwell, s, cavalry, was, quartered, in, the, church, at, kells, and, the, governor, of, the, town, sent, the, book, to, dublin, for, safekeeping, henry, jones, then, bishop, of, clogher, and, vice, chancellor, of, the, university, of, dublin, presented, the, manuscript, to, trinity, college, in, dublin, in, 1661, and, it, has, remained, there, ever, since, except, for, brief, loans, to, other, libraries, and, museums, it, has, been, on, display, to, the, public, in, the, old, library, at, trinity, since, the, 19th, century, the, manuscript, s, rise, to, worldwide, fame, began, in, the, 19th, century, the, association, with, st, columba, who, died, the, same, year, augustine, brought, christianity, and, literacy, to, canterbury, from, rome, was, used, to, demonstrate, ireland, s, cultural, primacy, seemingly, providing, irrefutable, precedence, in, the, debate, on, the, relative, authority, of, the, irish, and, roman, churches, queen, victoria, and, prince, albert, were, invited, to, sign, the, book, in, 1849, the, book, s, artistry, was, influential, on, the, celtic, revival, several, victorian, picture, books, of, medieval, illuminations, featured, designs, from, the, book, which, were, in, turn, extensively, copied, and, adapted, patterns, appearing, in, metalwork, embroidery, furniture, and, pottery, among, other, crafts, over, the, centuries, the, book, has, been, rebound, several, times, during, a, 19th, century, rebinding, the, pages, were, badly, cropped, with, small, parts, of, some, illustrations, being, lost, the, book, was, also, rebound, in, 1895, but, that, rebinding, broke, down, quickly, by, the, late, 1920s, several, folios, had, detached, completely, and, were, kept, separate, from, the, main, volume, in, 1953, bookbinder, roger, powell, rebound, the, manuscript, in, four, volumes, and, stretched, several, pages, that, had, developed, bulges, one, volume, is, always, on, display, at, trinity, opened, at, either, a, major, decorated, page, or, a, text, page, with, smaller, decorations, in, 2000, the, volume, containing, the, gospel, of, mark, was, sent, to, canberra, australia, for, an, exhibition, of, illuminated, manuscripts, this, was, only, the, fourth, time, the, book, of, kells, had, been, sent, abroad, for, exhibition, the, volume, suffered, what, has, been, called, minor, pigment, damage, while, en, route, to, canberra, it, is, thought, that, the, vibrations, from, the, aeroplane, s, engines, during, the, long, flight, may, have, caused, the, damage, the, book, of, kells, contains, the, four, gospels, of, the, christian, scriptures, written, in, black, red, purple, and, yellow, ink, in, an, insular, majuscule, script, preceded, by, prefaces, summaries, and, concordances, of, gospel, passages, today, it, consists, of, 340, vellum, leaves, or, folios, totalling, 680, pages, almost, all, folios, are, numbered, at, recto, bottom, left, one, folio, number, 36, was, mistakenly, double, counted, as, a, result, the, pagination, of, the, entire, book, is, reckoned, thus, folio, 1r, 36v, 36, r, 36, v, the, double, counted, folio, and, 37r, 339v, the, majority, of, the, folios, are, part, of, larger, sheets, called, bifolia, which, are, folded, in, half, to, form, two, folios, the, bifolia, are, nested, inside, of, each, other, and, sewn, together, to, form, gatherings, called, quires, on, occasion, a, folio, is, not, part, of, a, bifolium, but, is, instead, a, single, sheet, inserted, within, a, quire, the, extant, folios, are, gathered, into, 38, quires, there, are, between, four, and, twelve, folios, two, to, six, bifolia, per, quire, the, folios, are, commonly, but, not, invariably, bound, in, groups, of, ten, some, folios, are, single, sheets, as, is, frequently, the, case, with, the, important, decorated, pages, the, folios, had, lines, drawn, for, the, text, sometimes, on, both, sides, after, the, bifolia, were, folded, prick, marks, and, guidelines, can, still, be, seen, on, some, pages, the, vellum, is, of, high, quality, although, the, folios, have, an, uneven, thickness, with, some, being, close, to, leather, while, others, are, so, thin, as, to, be, almost, translucent, as, many, as, twelve, individuals, may, have, collaborated, on, the, book, s, production, of, whom, four, scribes, and, three, painters, have, been, distinguished, the, book, s, current, dimensions, are, 330, by, 250, mm, originally, the, folios, were, of, no, standard, size, but, they, were, cropped, to, the, current, size, during, a, 19th, century, rebinding, the, text, area, is, approximately, 250, by, 170, mm, each, text, page, has, 16, to, 18, lines, of, text, the, manuscript, is, in, remarkably, good, condition, considering, its, age, though, many, pages, have, suffered, some, damage, to, the, delicate, artwork, due, to, rubbing, the, book, must, have, been, the, product, of, a, major, scriptorium, over, several, years, yet, was, apparently, never, finished, the, projected, decoration, of, some, pages, appearing, only, in, outline, it, is, believed, that, the, original, manuscript, consisted, of, about, 370, folios, based, on, gaps, in, the, text, and, the, absence, of, key, illustrations, the, bulk, of, the, missing, material, or, about, 30, folios, was, perhaps, lost, when, the, book, was, stolen, in, the, early, 11th, century, in, 1621, the, prominent, anglican, clergyman, james, ussher, counted, just, 344, folios, presently, another, four, or, five, are, missing, from, the, body, of, the, text, after, folios, 177, 239, and, 330, the, missing, bifolium, 335, 36, was, found, and, restored, in, 1741, the, extant, book, contains, preliminary, matter, the, complete, text, of, the, gospels, of, matthew, mark, and, luke, and, the, gospel, of, john, through, john, 17, 13, the, remaining, preliminary, matter, consists, of, two, fragmentary, lists, of, hebrew, names, contained, in, the, gospels, breves, causae, gospel, summaries, argumenta, short, biographies, of, the, evangelists, and, eusebian, canon, tables, it, is, probable, that, like, the, lindisfarne, gospels, and, the, books, of, durrow, and, armagh, part, of, the, lost, preliminary, material, included, the, letter, of, jerome, to, pope, damasus, i, beginning, novum, opus, in, which, jerome, explains, the, purpose, of, his, translation, it, is, also, possible, though, less, likely, that, the, lost, material, included, the, letter, of, eusebius, to, carpianus, in, which, he, explains, the, use, of, the, canon, tables, of, all, the, insular, gospels, only, the, lindisfarne, manuscript, contains, this, letter, there, are, two, fragments, of, the, lists, of, hebrew, names, one, on, the, recto, of, the, first, surviving, folio, and, one, on, folio, 26, which, is, currently, inserted, at, the, end, of, the, prefatory, matter, for, john, the, first, list, fragment, contains, the, end, of, the, list, for, the, gospel, of, matthew, the, missing, names, from, matthew, would, require, an, additional, two, folios, the, second, list, fragment, on, folio, 26, contains, about, a, fourth, of, the, list, for, luke, the, list, for, luke, would, require, an, additional, three, folios, the, structure, of, the, quire, in, which, folio, 26, occurs, is, such, that, it, is, unlikely, that, there, are, three, folios, missing, between, folios, 26, and, 27, so, that, it, is, almost, certain, that, folio, 26, is, not, now, in, its, original, location, there, is, no, trace, of, the, lists, for, mark, and, john, the, first, list, fragment, is, followed, by, the, canon, tables, of, eusebius, of, caesarea, these, tables, which, predate, the, text, of, the, vulgate, were, developed, to, cross, reference, the, gospels, eusebius, divided, the, gospel, into, chapters, and, then, created, tables, that, allowed, readers, to, find, where, a, given, episode, in, the, life, of, christ, was, located, in, each, of, the, gospels, the, canon, tables, were, traditionally, included, in, the, prefatory, material, in, most, medieval, copies, of, the, vulgate, text, of, the, gospels, the, tables, in, the, book, of, kells, are, however, unusable, first, because, the, scribe, condensed, the, tables, in, such, a, way, as, to, make, them, confused, second, and, more, importantly, the, corresponding, chapter, numbers, were, never, inserted, into, the, margins, of, the, text, making, it, impossible, to, find, the, sections, to, which, the, canon, tables, refer, the, reason, for, the, omission, remains, unclear, the, scribe, may, have, planned, to, add, the, references, upon, the, manuscript, s, completion, or, he, may, have, deliberately, left, them, out, so, as, not, to, spoil, the, appearance, of, pages, the, breves, causae, and, argumenta, belong, to, a, pre, vulgate, tradition, of, manuscripts, the, breves, causae, are, summaries, of, the, old, latin, translations, of, the, gospels, and, are, divided, into, numbered, chapters, these, chapter, numbers, like, the, numbers, for, the, canon, tables, are, not, used, on, the, text, pages, of, the, gospels, it, is, unlikely, that, these, numbers, would, have, been, used, even, if, the, manuscript, had, been, completed, because, the, chapter, numbers, corresponded, to, old, latin, translations, and, would, have, been, difficult, to, harmonise, with, the, vulgate, text, the, argumenta, are, collections, of, legends, about, the, evangelists, the, breves, causae, and, argumenta, are, arranged, in, a, strange, order, first, come, the, breves, causae, and, argumenta, for, matthew, followed, by, the, breves, and, argumenta, for, mark, then, quite, oddly, come, the, argumenta, of, both, luke, and, john, followed, by, their, breves, causae, this, anomalous, order, mirrors, that, found, in, the, book, of, durrow, although, in, the, latter, instance, the, misplaced, sections, appear, at, the, very, end, of, the, manuscript, rather, than, as, part, of, a, continuous, preliminary, in, other, insular, manuscripts, such, as, the, lindisfarne, gospels, the, book, of, armagh, and, the, echternach, gospels, each, gospel, is, treated, as, a, separate, work, and, has, its, preliminaries, immediately, preceding, it, the, slavish, repetition, in, kells, of, the, order, of, the, breves, causae, and, argumenta, found, in, durrow, led, scholar, t, k, abbott, to, conclude, that, the, scribes, of, kells, had, either, the, book, of, durrow, or, a, common, model, in, hand, the, book, of, kells, contains, the, text, of, the, four, gospels, based, on, the, vulgate, it, does, not, however, contain, a, pure, copy, of, the, vulgate, there, are, numerous, differences, from, the, vulgate, where, old, latin, translations, are, used, in, lieu, of, jerome, s, text, although, such, variants, are, common, in, all, the, insular, gospels, there, does, not, seem, to, be, a, consistent, pattern, of, variation, amongst, the, various, insular, texts, evidence, suggests, that, when, the, scribes, were, writing, the, text, they, often, depended, on, memory, rather, than, on, their, exemplar, the, manuscript, is, written, primarily, in, insular, majuscule, with, some, occurrences, of, minuscule, letters, usually, e, or, s, the, text, is, usually, written, in, one, long, line, across, the, page, fran, oise, henry, identified, at, least, three, scribes, in, the, manuscript, whom, she, named, hand, a, hand, b, and, hand, c, hand, a, is, found, on, folios, 1, through, 19v, folios, 276, through, 289, and, folios, 307, through, the, end, of, the, manuscript, hand, a, for, the, most, part, writes, eighteen, or, nineteen, lines, per, page, in, the, brown, gall, ink, common, throughout, the, west, hand, b, is, found, on, folios, 19r, through, 26, and, folios, 124, through, 128, hand, b, has, a, somewhat, greater, tendency, to, use, minuscule, and, uses, red, purple, and, black, ink, and, a, variable, number, of, lines, per, page, hand, c, is, found, throughout, the, majority, of, the, text, hand, c, also, has, a, greater, tendency, to, use, minuscule, than, hand, a, hand, c, uses, the, same, brownish, gall, ink, used, by, hand, a, and, wrote, almost, always, seventeen, lines, per, page, additionally, a, fourth, scribe, named, hand, d, has, been, hypothesized, to, whom, folio, 104r, was, attributed, there, are, several, differences, between, the, text, and, the, accepted, gospels, in, the, genealogy, of, jesus, which, starts, at, luke, 3, 23, kells, names, an, extra, ancestor, at, matthew, 10, 34, a, common, english, translation, reads, i, came, not, to, send, peace, but, a, sword, however, the, manuscript, reads, gaudium, joy, where, it, should, read, gladium, sword, thus, translating, as, i, came, not, only, to, send, peace, but, joy, the, lavishly, decorated, opening, page, of, the, gospel, according, to, john, had, been, deciphered, by, george, bain, as, in, principio, erat, verbum, verum, in, the, beginning, was, the, true, word, therefore, the, incipit, is, a, free, translation, into, latin, of, the, greek, original, rather, than, a, mere, copy, of, the, roman, version, over, the, centuries, multiple, annotations, have, been, written, in, the, book, recording, page, information, and, historical, events,

transcribed, the, charters, in, his, collected, works, and, they, were, later, translated, into, english, a, blank, page, at, the, end, of, luke, folio, 289v, contains, a, poem, complaining, of, taxation, upon, church, land, dated, to, the, 14th, or, 15th, century, in, the, early, 17th, century, one, richardus, whit, recorded, several, recent, events, on, the, same, page, in, clumsy, latin, including, a, famine, in, 1586, the, accession, of, james, i, and, plague, in, ireland, during, 1604, the, signature, of, thomas, ridgeway, 17th, century, treasurer, of, ireland, is, extant, on, folio, 31v, and, the, 1853, monogram, of, john, o, westwood, author, of, an, early, modern, account, of, the, book, is, found, on, 339r, three, notes, concerning, the, book, s, pagination, are, found, together, on, a, single, page, folio, 334v, in, 1568, one, geralde, plunket, noted, his, annotations, of, the, gospel, s, chapter, numbers, throughout, the, book, a, second, note, from, 1588, gave, a,

notes, on, folio, 337r, plunket, s, accretions, were, varied, and, significant, he, inscribed, transcriptions, in, the, margins, of, the, major, illuminated, folios, 8r, 29r, 203r, and, 292r, on, folio, 32v, he, added, the, annotation, jesus, christus, in, the, spandrels, of, the, composition, s, architecture, identifying, the, portrait, s, subject, as, christ, in, the, 19th, century, this, annotation, was, covered, by, white, paint, altering, the, composition, plunket, also, wrote, his, name, on, multiple, pages, and, added, small, animal, embellishments, the, text, is, accompanied, by, many, full, page, miniature, illustrations, while, smaller, painted, decorations, appear, throughout, the, text, in, unprecedented, quantities, the, decoration, of, the, book, is, famous, for, combining, intricate, detail, with, bold, and, energetic, compositions, the, characteristics, of, the, insular, manuscript, initial, as, described, by, carl, nordenfalk, here, reach, their, most, extreme, realisation, the, initials, are, conceived, as, elastic, forms, expanding, and, contracting, with, a, pulsating, rhythm, the, kinetic, energy, of, their, contours, escapes, into, freely, drawn, appendices, a, spiral, line, which, in, turn, generates, new, curvilinear, motifs, the, illustrations, feature, a, broad, range, of, colours, with, purple, lilac, red, pink, green, and, yellow, being, the, colours, most, often, used, earlier, manuscripts, tend, toward, more, narrow, palettes, the, book, of, durrow, for, example, uses, only, four, colours, as, is, usual, with, insular, work, there, was, no, use, of, gold, or, silver, leaf, in, the, manuscript, the, pigments, for, the, illustrations, included, red, and, yellow, ochre, green, copper, pigment, sometimes, called, verdigris, indigo, and, possibly, lapis, lazuli, these, would, have, been, imported, from, the, mediterranean, region, and, in, the, case, of, the, lapis, lazuli, also, known, as, ultramarine, from, northeast, afghanistan, though, the, presence, of, lapis, lazuli, has, long, been, considered, evidence, of, the, great, cost, required, to, create, the, manuscript, recent, examination, of, the, pigments, has, shown, that, lapis, lazuli, was, not, used, the, lavish, illumination, programme, is, far, greater, than, any, other, surviving, insular, gospel, book, thirty, three, of, the, surviving, pages, contain, decorative, elements, which, dominate, the, entire, page, these, include, ten, full, page, miniature, illustrations, a, portrait, of, the, virgin, and, child, three, pages, of, evangelist, symbols, informed, by, the, tetramorphs, described, in, ezekiel, and, revelation, two, evangelist, portraits, a, portrait, of, christ, enthroned, a, carpet, page, and, scenes, of, the, arrest, of, jesus, and, temptation, of, christ, twelve, fully, decorated, text, pages, embellish, the, book, s, verses, of, which, the, most, extreme, examples, are, the, four, incipits, beginning, each, gospel, together, with, the, chi, rho, monogram, a, page, receiving, comparable, treatment, which, heralds, a, second, beginning, of, matthew, the, narrative, of, christ, s, life, following, his, genealogy, another, six, fully, decorated, text, pages, emphasize, various, points, in, the, passion, story, while, a, seventh, corresponds, to, the, temptation, the, first, eleven, pages, of, the, extant, manuscript, begin, with, a, decorated, list, of, hebrew, names, followed, by, ten, pages, of, eusebian, canon, tables, framed, by, architectural, elements, additionally, fourteen, pages, feature, large, decorative, elements, which, do, not, extend, throughout, the, entire, page, it, is, highly, probable, that, there, were, other, pages, of, miniature, and, decorated, text, that, are, now, lost, henry, identified, at, least, three, distinct, artists, the, goldsmith, was, responsible, for, the, chi, rho, page, using, colour, to, convey, metallic, hues, the, illustrator, was, given, to, idiosyncratic, portraits, having, produced, the, temptation, and, the, arrest, of, christ, the, portrait, painter, executed, the, portraits, of, christ, and, the, evangelists, almost, every, page, contains, a, decorative, element, incorporating, colour, throughout, the, text, pages, these, are, commonly, stylized, capitals, only, two, pages, folios, 29v, and, 301v, are, devoid, of, pigment, colouration, or, overt, pictorial, elements, but, even, they, contain, trace, decorations, in, ink, the, extant, folios, of, the, manuscript, start, with, the, fragment, of, the, glossary, of, hebrew, names, this, fragment, occupies, the, left, hand, column, of, folio, 1r, a, miniature, of, the, four, evangelist, symbols, now, much, abraded, occupies, the, right, hand, column, the, miniature, is, oriented, so, that, the, volume, must, be, turned, ninety, degrees, to, view, it, properly, the, four, evangelist, symbols, are, a, visual, theme, that, runs, throughout, the, book, they, are, almost, always, shown, together, to, emphasise, the, doctrine, of, the, four, gospels, unity, of, message, the, unity, of, the, gospels, is, further, emphasised, by, the, decoration, of, the, eusebian, canon, tables, the, canon, tables, illustrate, the, unity, of, the, gospels, by, organising, corresponding, passages, from, the, gospels, the, eusebian, canon, tables, normally, require, twelve, pages, in, the, book, of, kells, the, makers, of, the, manuscript, planned, for, twelve, pages, folios, 1v, through, 7r, but, for, unknown, reasons, condensed, them, into, ten, leaving, folios, 6v, and, 7r, blank, this, condensation, rendered, the, canon, tables, unusable, the, decoration, of, the, first, eight, pages, of, the, canon, tables, is, heavily, influenced, by, early, gospel, books, from, the, mediterranean, where, it, was, traditional, to, enclose, the, tables, within, an, arcade, as, seen, in, the, london, canon, tables, the, kells, manuscript, presents, this, motif, in, an, insular, spirit, where, the, arcades, are, not, seen, as, architectural, elements, but, rather, become, stylised, geometric, patterns, with, insular, ornamentation, the, four, evangelist, symbols, occupy, the, spaces, under, and, above, the, arches, the, last, two, canon, tables, are, presented, within, a, grid, this, presentation, is, limited, to, insular, manuscripts, and, was, first, seen, in, the, book, of, durrow, the, preliminary, matter, is, introduced, by, an, iconic, image, of, the, virgin, and, child, folio, 7v, the, first, representation, of, the, virgin, mary, in, a, western, manuscript, mary, is, shown, in, an, odd, mixture, of, frontal, and, three, quarter, pose, this, miniature, also, bears, a, stylistic, similarity, to, the, carved, image, on, the, lid, of, st, cuthbert, s, coffin, of, 698, the, iconography, of, the, miniature, seems, to, derive, from, byzantine, armenian, or, coptic, art, the, miniature, of, the, virgin, and, child, faces, the, first, page, of, the, text, which, begins, the, breves, causae, of, matthew, with, the, phrase, nativitas, christi, in, bethlem, the, birth, of, christ, in, bethlehem, the, beginning, page, folio, 8r, of, the, text, of, the, breves, causae, is, decorated, and, contained, within, an, elaborate, frame, the, two, page, spread, of, the, miniature, and, the, text, makes, a, vivid, introductory, statement, for, the, prefatory, material, the, opening, lines, of, six, of, the, other, seven, pieces, of, preliminary, matter, are, enlarged, and, decorated, see, above, for, the, breves, causae, of, luke, but, no, other, section, of, the, preliminaries, is, given, the, same, full, page, treatment, as, the, beginning, of, the, breves, causae, of, matthew, the, book, was, designed, so, that, each, of, the, gospels, would, have, an, elaborate, introductory, decorative, programme, each, gospel, was, originally, prefaced, by, a, full, page, miniature, containing, the, four, evangelist, symbols, followed, by, a, blank, page, then, came, a, portrait, of, the, evangelist, which, faced, the, opening, text, of, the, gospel, itself, given, an, elaborate, decorative, treatment, the, gospel, of, matthew, retains, both, its, evangelist, portrait, folio, 28v, and, its, page, of, evangelist, symbols, folio, 27v, see, above, the, gospel, of, mark, is, missing, the, evangelist, portrait, but, retains, its, evangelist, symbols, page, folio, 129v, the, gospel, of, luke, is, missing, both, the, portrait, and, the, evangelist, symbols, page, the, gospel, of, john, like, the, gospel, of, matthew, retains, both, its, portrait, folio, 291v, see, at, right, and, its, evangelist, symbols, page, folio, 290v, it, can, be, assumed, that, the, portraits, for, mark, and, luke, and, the, symbols, page, for, luke, at, one, time, existed, but, have, been, lost, the, ornamentation, of, the, opening, few, words, of, each, gospel, is, lavish, their, decoration, is, so, elaborate, that, the, text, itself, is, almost, illegible, the, opening, page, folio, 29r, of, matthew, may, stand, as, an, example, see, illustration, at, left, the, page, consists, of, only, two, words, liber, generationis, the, book, of, the, generation, the, lib, of, liber, is, turned, into, a, giant, monogram, which, dominates, the, entire, page, the, er, of, liber, is, presented, as, an, interlaced, ornament, within, the, b, of, the, lib, monogram, generationis, is, broken, into, three, lines, and, contained, within, an, elaborate, frame, in, the, right, lower, quadrant, of, the, page, the, entire, assemblage, is, contained, within, an, elaborate, border, further, decorated, with, elaborate, spirals, and, knot, work, many, of, which, are, zoomorphic, the, opening, words, of, the, gospel, of, mark, initium, evangelii, iesu, christi, the, beginning, of, the, gospel, of, jesus, christ, luke, quoniam, forasmuch, and, john, in, principio, erat, verbum, verum, in, the, beginning, was, the, true, word, are, all, given, similar, treatments, although, the, decoration, of, these, pages, was, most, extensive, in, the, book, of, kells, they, are, all, decorated, in, the, other, insular, gospel, books, the, gospel, of, matthew, begins, with, a, genealogy, of, jesus, followed, by, his, portrait, folio, 32v, top, of, article, has, a, miniature, of, christ, enthroned, flanked, by, peacocks, peacocks, function, as, symbols, of, christ, throughout, the, book, according, to, earlier, accounts, given, by, isidore, of, seville, and, augustine, in, the, city, of, god, the, peacocks, flesh, does, not, putrefy, the, animals, therefore, became, associated, with, christ, via, the, resurrection, facing, the, portrait, of, christ, on, folio, 33r, is, the, only, carpet, page, in, the, book, of, kells, which, is, rather, anomalous, the, lindisfarne, gospels, have, five, extant, carpet, pages, and, the, book, of, durrow, has, six, the, blank, verso, of, folio, 33, faces, the, single, most, lavish, miniature, of, the, early, medieval, period, the, book, of, kells, chi, rho, monogram, which, serves, as, incipit, for, the, narrative, of, the, life, of, christ, at, matthew, 1, 18, folio, 34r, the, actual, narrative, of, christ, s, life, starts, this, second, beginning, to, matthew, was, given, emphasis, in, many, early, gospel, books, so, much, so, that, the, two, sections, were, often, treated, as, separate, works, the, second, beginning, starts, with, the, word, christ, the, greek, letters, chi, and, rho, were, normally, used, in, medieval, manuscripts, to, abbreviate, the, word, christ, in, insular, gospel, books, the, initial, chi, rho, monogram, was, enlarged, and, decorated, in, the, book, of, kells, this, second, beginning, was, given, a, decorative, programme, equal, to, those, prefacing, the, gospels, its, chi, rho, monogram, having, grown, to, consume, the, entire, page, the, letter, chi, dominates, the, page, with, one, arm, swooping, across, the, majority, of, the, page, the, letter, rho, is, snuggled, underneath, the, arms, of, the, chi, both, letters, are, divided, into, compartments, which, are, lavishly, decorated, with, knotwork, and, other, patterns, the, background, is, likewise, awash, in, a, mass, of, swirling, and, knotted, decoration, within, this, mass, of, decoration, are, hidden, animals, and, insects, three, angels, arise, from, one, of, the, cross, arms, of, the, chi, this, miniature, is, the, largest, and, most, lavish, extant, chi, rho, monogram, in, any, insular, gospel, book, the, culmination, of, a, tradition, that, started, with, the, book, of, durrow, the, book, of, kells, contains, two, other, full, page, illustrations, which, depict, episodes, from, the, passion, story, the, text, of, matthew, is, illustrated, with, a, full, page, illumination, of, the, arrest, of, christ, folio, 114r, jesus, is, shown, beneath, a, stylised, arcade, while, being, held, by, two, much, smaller, figures, in, the, text, of, luke, there, is, a, full, sized, miniature, of, the, temptation, of, christ, folio, 202v, christ, is, shown, from, the, waist, up, on, top, of, the, temple, to, his, right, is, a, crowd, of, people, perhaps, representing, his, disciples, to, his, left, and, below, him, is, a, black, figure, of, satan, above, him, hover, two, angels, throughout, the, body, of, the, gospels, six, fully, decorated, text, pages, receive, treatment, comparable, to, that, of, the, page, which, began, the, breves, causae, of, matthew, of, these, five, correspond, to, episodes, in, the, passion, story, and, one, refers, to, the, temptation, the, verso, of, the, folio, containing, the, arrest, of, christ, 114v, has, a, full, page, of, decorated, text, which, reads, tunc, dicit, illis, iesus, omnes, vos, scan, dalum, matthew, 26, 31, where, jesus, addresses, his, disciples, immediately, before, his, arrest, a, few, pages, later, folio, 124r, is, found, a, very, similar, decoration, of, the, phrase, tunc, crucifixerant, xpi, cum, eo, duos, latrones, matthew, 27, 38, christ, s, crucifixion, together, with, two, thieves, in, the, gospel, of, mark, another, decorated, page, folio, 183r, gives, a, description, of, the, crucifixion, mark, 15, 25, while, the, final, and, decorated, page, of, mark, folio, 187v, describes, christ, s, resurrection, and, ascension, mark, 16, 19, 20, in, the, gospel, of, luke, folio, 203r, faces, the, illustration, of, the, temptation, itself, an, illumination, of, the, text, luke, 4, 1, beginning, the, temptation, narrative, finally, folio, 285r, is, a, fully, decorated, page, corresponding, to, another, moment, of, the, passion, luke, 23, 56, luke, 24, 1, between, the, crucifixion, and, the, resurrection, since, the, missing, folios, of, john, contain, another, passion, narrative, it, is, likely, that, john, contained, full, pages, of, decorated, text, that, have, been, lost, apart, from, the, thirty, three, fully, illuminated, pages, fourteen, receive, substantial, decoration, not, extending, over, the, entire, page, among, the, preliminaries, and, apart, from, the, fully, decorated, page, beginning, the, breves, causae, of, matthew, six, pages, begin, six, of, the, eight, sections, of, breves, causae, and, argumenta, with, embellished, names, the, exception, is, folio, 24v, which, introduces, the, final, section, of, the, breves,

the, letters, b, beginning, each, line, are, linked, into, an, ornate, chain, along, the, left, margin, of, the, page, folio, 127v, has, an, embellished, line, beginning, the, final, chapter, of, matthew, which, gives, an, account, of, the, resurrection, a, similar, treatment, is, given, to, a, line, in, folio, 188v, luke, 1, 5, which, begins, an, account, of, the, nativity, the, book, had, a, sacramental, rather, than, educational, purpose, such, a, large, lavish, gospel, would, have, been, left, on, the, high, altar, of, the, church, and, removed, only, for, the, reading, of, the, gospel, during, mass, with, the, reader, probably, reciting, from, memory, more, than, reading, the, text, it, is, significant, that, the, chronicles, of, ulster, state, the, book, was, stolen, from, the, sacristy, where, the, vessels, and, other, accoutrements, of, the, mass, were, stored, rather, than, from, the, monastic, library, its, design, seems, to, take, this, purpose, in, mind, that, is, the, book, was, produced, with, appearance, taking, precedence, over, practicality, there, are, numerous, uncorrected, mistakes, in, the, text, lines, were, often, completed, in, a, blank, space, in, the, line, above, the, chapter, headings, that, were, necessary, to, make, the, canon, tables, usable, were, not, inserted, into, the, margins, of, the, page, in, general, nothing, was, done, to, disrupt,

touching, it, and, so, won, permission, to, publish, a, new, facsimile, after, each, page, was, photographed, a, single, page, facsimile, was, prepared, so, the, colours, could, be, carefully, compared, to, the, original, and, adjustments, made, where, necessary, the, completed, work, was, published, in, 1990, in, a, two, volume, set, containing, the, full, facsimile, and, scholarly,
