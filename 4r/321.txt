the, pipe, organ, is, a, musical, instrument, that, produces, sound, by, driving, pressurised, air, called, wind, through, the, organ, pipes, selected, from, a, keyboard, because, each, pipe, produces, a, single, pitch, the, pipes, are, provided, in, sets, called, ranks, each, of, which, has, a, common, timbre, volume, and, construction, throughout, the, keyboard, compass, most, organs, have, many, ranks, of, pipes, of, differing, pitch, timbre, and, volume, that, the, player, can, employ, singly, or, in, combination, through, the, use, of, controls, called, stops, a, pipe, organ, has, one, or, more, keyboards, called, manuals, played, by, the, hands, and, a, pedal, clavier, played, by, the, feet, each, keyboard, controls, its, own, division, group, of, stops, the, keyboard, s, pedalboard, and, stops, are, housed, in, the, organ, s, console, the, organ, s, continuous, supply, of, wind, allows, it, to, sustain, notes, for, as, long, as, the, corresponding, keys, are, pressed, unlike, the, piano, and, harpsichord, whose, sound, begins, to, dissipate, immediately, after, a, key, is, depressed, the, smallest, portable, pipe, organs, may, have, only, one, or, two, dozen, pipes, and, one, manual, the, largest, organs, may, have, over, 33, 000, pipes, and, as, many, as, seven, manuals, a, list, of, some, of, the, most, notable, and, largest, pipe, organs, in, the, world, can, be, viewed, at, list, of, pipe, organs, a, ranking, of, the, largest, organs, in, the, world, based, on, the, criterion, constructed, by, micha, szostak, i, e, the, number, of, ranks, and, additional, equipment, managed, from, a, single, console, can, be, found, in, the, quarterly, magazine, the, organ, and, in, the, online, journal, vox, humana, the, origins, of, the, pipe, organ, can, be, traced, back, to, the, hydraulis, in, ancient, greece, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, in, which, the, wind, supply, was, created, by, the, weight, of, displaced, water, in, an, airtight, container, by, the, 6th, or, 7th, century, ad, bellows, were, used, to, supply, byzantine, organs, with, wind, a, pipe, organ, with, great, leaden, pipes, was, sent, to, the, west, by, the, byzantine, emperor, constantine, v, as, a, gift, to, pepin, the, short, king, of, the, franks, in, 757, pepin, s, son, charlemagne, requested, a, similar, organ, for, his, chapel, in, aachen, in, 812, beginning, the, pipe, organ, s, establishment, in, western, european, church, music, in, england, the, first, organ, of, which, any, detailed, record, exists, was, built, in, winchester, cathedral, in, the, 10th, century, it, was, a, huge, machine, with, 400, pipes, which, needed, two, men, to, play, it, and, 70, men, to, blow, it, and, its, sound, could, be, heard, throughout, the, city, beginning, in, the, 12th, century, the, organ, began, to, evolve, into, a, complex, instrument, capable, of, producing, different, timbres, by, the, 17th, century, most, of, the, sounds, available, on, the, modern, classical, organ, had, been, developed, at, that, time, the, pipe, organ, was, the, most, complex, human, made, device, a, distinction, it, retained, until, it, was, displaced, by, the, telephone, exchange, in, the, late, 19th, century, pipe, organs, are, installed, in, churches, synagogues, concert, halls, schools, mansions, other, public, buildings, and, in, private, properties, they, are, used, in, the, performance, of, classical, music, sacred, music, secular, music, and, popular, music, in, the, early, 20th, century, pipe, organs, were, installed, in, theaters, to, accompany, the, screening, of, films, during, the, silent, movie, era, in, municipal, auditoria, where, orchestral, transcriptions, were, popular, and, in, the, homes, of, the, wealthy, the, beginning, of, the, 21st, century, has, seen, a, resurgence, in, installations, in, concert, halls, a, substantial, organ, repertoire, spans, over, 500, years, the, organ, is, one, of, the, oldest, instruments, still, used, in, european, classical, music, that, has, commonly, been, credited, as, having, derived, from, greece, its, earliest, predecessors, were, built, in, ancient, greece, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, the, word, organ, is, derived, from, the, ancient, greek, rganon, a, generic, term, for, an, instrument, or, a, tool, via, the, latin, organum, an, instrument, similar, to, a, portative, organ, used, in, ancient, roman, circus, games, the, greek, engineer, ctesibius, of, alexandria, is, credited, with, inventing, the, organ, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, he, devised, an, instrument, called, the, hydraulis, which, delivered, a, wind, supply, maintained, through, water, pressure, to, a, set, of, pipes, the, hydraulis, was, played, in, the, arenas, of, the, roman, empire, the, pumps, and, water, regulators, of, the, hydraulis, were, replaced, by, an, inflated, leather, bag, in, the, 2nd, century, ad, and, true, bellows, began, to, appear, in, the, eastern, roman, empire, in, the, 6th, or, 7th, century, ad, some, 400, pieces, of, a, hydraulis, from, the, year, 228, ad, were, revealed, during, the, 1931, archaeological, excavations, in, the, former, roman, town, aquincum, province, of, pannonia, present, day, budapest, which, was, used, as, a, music, instrument, by, the, aquincum, fire, dormitory, a, modern, replica, produces, an, enjoyable, sound, the, 9th, century, persian, geographer, ibn, khurradadhbih, d, 913, in, his, lexicographical, discussion, of, instruments, cited, the, urghun, organ, as, one, of, the, typical, instruments, of, the, eastern, roman, byzantine, empire, it, was, often, used, in, the, hippodrome, in, the, imperial, capital, of, constantinople, a, syrian, visitor, describes, a, pipe, organ, powered, by, two, servants, pumping, bellows, like, a, blacksmith, s, played, while, guests, ate, at, the, emperor, s, christmas, dinner, in, constantinople, in, 911, the, first, western, european, pipe, organ, with, great, leaden, pipes, was, sent, from, constantinople, to, the, west, by, the, byzantine, emperor, constantine, v, as, a, gift, to, pepin, the, short, king, of, the, franks, in, 757, pepin, s, son, charlemagne, requested, a, similar, organ, for, his, chapel, in, aachen, in, 812, beginning, its, establishment, in, western, european, church, music, from, 800, to, the, 1400s, the, use, and, construction, of, organs, developed, in, significant, ways, from, the, invention, of, the, portative, and, positive, organs, to, the, installation, of, larger, organs, in, major, churches, such, as, the, cathedrals, of, winchester, and, notre, dame, of, paris, in, this, period, organs, began, to, be, used, in, secular, and, religious, settings, the, introduction, of, organ, into, religious, settings, is, ambiguous, most, likely, because, the, original, position, of, the, church, was, that, instrumental, music, was, not, to, be, allowed, by, the, 12th, century, there, is, evidence, for, permanently, installed, organs, existing, in, religious, settings, such, as, the, abbey, of, f, camp, and, other, locations, throughout, europe, several, innovations, occurred, to, organs, in, the, middle, ages, such, as, the, creation, of, the, portative, and, the, positive, organ, the, portative, organs, were, small, and, created, for, secular, use, and, made, of, light, weight, delicate, materials, that, would, have, been, easy, for, one, individual, to, transport, and, play, on, their, own, the, portative, organ, was, a, flue, piped, keyboard, instrument, played, with, one, hand, while, the, other, operated, the, bellows, its, portability, made, the, portative, useful, for, the, accompaniment, of, both, sacred, and, secular, music, in, a, variety, of, settings, the, positive, organ, was, larger, than, the, portative, organ, but, was, still, small, enough, to, be, portable, and, used, in, a, variety, of, settings, like, the, portative, organ, toward, the, middle, of, the, 13th, century, the, portatives, represented, in, the, miniatures, of, illuminated, manuscripts, appear, to, have, real, keyboards, with, balanced, keys, as, in, the, cantigas, de, santa, maria, it, is, difficult, to, directly, determine, when, larger, were, first, installed, in, europe, an, early, detailed, eyewitness, account, from, wulfstan, of, winchester, gives, an, idea, of, what, organs, were, like, prior, to, the, 13th, century, after, which, more, records, of, large, church, organs, exist, in, his, account, he, describes, the, sound, of, the, organ, among, them, bells, outstanding, in, tone, and, size, and, an, organ, through, bronze, pipes, prepared, according, to, the, musical, proportions, this, is, one, of, the, earliest, accounts, of, organs, in, europe, and, also, indicates, that, the, organ, was, large, and, more, permanent, than, other, evidence, would, suggest, the, first, organ, documented, to, have, been, permanently, installed, was, one, installed, in, 1361, in, halberstadt, germany, the, first, documented, permanent, organ, installation, likely, prompted, guillaume, de, machaut, to, describe, the, organ, as, the, king, of, instruments, a, characterization, still, frequently, applied, the, halberstadt, organ, was, the, first, instrument, to, use, a, chromatic, key, layout, across, its, three, manuals, and, pedalboard, although, the, keys, were, wider, than, on, modern, instruments, the, width, of, the, keys, was, slightly, over, two, and, a, half, inches, wide, enough, to, be, struck, down, by, the, fist, as, the, early, keys, are, reported, to, have, invariably, been, manipulated, it, had, twenty, bellows, operated, by, ten, men, and, the, wind, pressure, was, so, high, that, the, player, had, to, use, the, full, strength, of, their, arm, to, hold, down, a, key, records, of, other, organs, permanently, installed, and, used, in, worship, services, in, the, late, 13th, and, 14th, centuries, are, found, in, large, cathedrals, such, as, notre, dame, the, latter, documenting, organists, hired, to, by, the, church, and, the, installation, of, larger, and, permanent, organs, the, earliest, is, a, payment, in, 1332, from, the, clergy, of, notre, dame, to, an, organist, to, perform, on, the, feasts, st, louis, and, st, michael, the, notre, dame, school, also, shows, how, organs, could, have, been, used, within, the, increased, use, of, polyphony, which, would, have, allowed, for, the, use, of, more, instrumental, voices, within, the, music, according, to, documentation, from, the, 9th, century, by, walafrid, strabo, the, organ, was, also, used, for, music, during, other, parts, of, the, church, service, the, prelude, and, postlude, the, main, examples, and, not, just, for, the, effect, of, polyphony, with, the, choir, other, possible, instances, of, this, were, short, interludes, played, on, the, organ, either, in, between, parts, of, the, church, service, or, during, choral, songs, but, they, were, not, played, at, the, same, time, as, the, choir, was, singing, this, shows, that, by, this, point, in, time, organs, were, fully, used, within, church, services, and, not, just, in, secular, settings, organs, from, earlier, in, the, medieval, period, are, evidenced, by, surviving, keyboards, and, casings, but, no, pipes, until, the, mid, 15th, century, organs, had, no, stop, controls, each, manual, controlled, ranks, at, many, pitches, known, as, the, blockwerk, around, 1450, controls, were, designed, that, allowed, the, ranks, of, the, blockwerk, to, be, played, individually, these, devices, were, the, forerunners, of, modern, stop, actions, the, higher, pitched, ranks, of, the, blockwerk, remained, grouped, together, under, a, single, stop, control, these, stops, developed, into, mixtures, during, the, renaissance, and, baroque, periods, the, organ, s, tonal, colors, became, more, varied, organ, builders, fashioned, stops, that, imitated, various, instruments, such, as, the, krummhorn, and, the, viola, da, gamba, builders, such, as, arp, schnitger, jasper, johannsen, zacharias, hildebrandt, and, gottfried, silbermann, constructed, instruments, that, were, in, themselves, artistic, displaying, both, exquisite, craftsmanship, and, beautiful, sound, these, organs, featured, well, balanced, mechanical, key, actions, giving, the, organist, precise, control, over, the, pipe, speech, schnitger, s, organs, featured, particularly, distinctive, reed, timbres, and, large, pedal, and, r, ckpositiv, divisions, different, national, styles, of, organ, building, began, to, develop, often, due, to, changing, political, climates, in, the, netherlands, the, organ, became, a, large, instrument, with, several, divisions, doubled, ranks, and, mounted, cornets, the, organs, of, northern, germany, also, had, more, divisions, and, independent, pedal, divisions, became, increasingly, common, organ, makers, began, designing, their, cases, in, such, a, way, that, the, divisions, of, the, organ, were, visibly, discernible, twentieth, century, musicologists, have, retroactively, labelled, this, the, werkprinzip, in, france, as, in, italy, spain, and, portugal, organs, were, primarily, designed, to, play, alternatim, verses, rather, than, accompany, congregational, singing, the, french, classical, organ, became, remarkably, consistent, throughout, france, over, the, course, of, the, baroque, era, more, so, than, any, other, style, of, organ, building, in, history, and, standardized, registrations, developed, this, type, of, instrument, was, elaborately, described, by, dom, b, dos, de, celles, in, his, treatise, l, art, du, facteur, d, orgues, the, art, of, organ, building, the, italian, baroque, organ, was, often, a, single, manual, instrument, without, pedals, it, was, built, on, a, full, diapason, chorus, of, octaves, and, fifths, the, stop, names, indicated, the, pitch, relative, to, the, fundamental, principale, and, typically, reached, extremely, short, nominal, pipe, lengths, for, example, if, the, principale, were, 8, the, vigesimanona, was, the, highest, ranks, broke, back, their, smallest, pipes, replaced, by, pipes, pitched, an, octave, lower, to, produce, a, kind, of, composite, treble, mixture, in, england, many, pipe, organs, were, destroyed, or, removed, from, churches, during, the, english, reformation, of, the, 16th, century, and, the, commonwealth, period, some, were, relocated, to, private, homes, at, the, restoration, organ, builders, such, as, renatus, harris, and, father, bernard, smith, brought, new, organ, building, ideas, from, continental, europe, english, organs, evolved, from, small, one, or, two, manual, instruments, into, three, or, more, divisions, disposed, in, the, french, manner, with, grander, reeds, and, mixtures, though, still, without, pedal, keyboards, the, echo, division, began, to, be, enclosed, in, the, early, 18th, century, and, in, 1712, abraham, jordan, claimed, his, swelling, organ, at, st, magnus, the, martyr, to, be, a, new, invention, the, swell, box, and, the, independent, pedal, division, appeared, in, english, organs, beginning, in, the, 18th, century, during, the, romantic, period, the, organ, became, more, symphonic, capable, of, creating, a, gradual, crescendo, this, was, made, possible, by, voicing, stops, in, such, a, way, that, families, of, tone, that, historically, had, only, been, used, separately, could, now, be, used, together, creating, an, entirely, new, way, of, approaching, organ, registration, new, technologies, and, the, work, of, organ, builders, such, as, eberhard, friedrich, walcker, aristide, cavaill, coll, and, henry, willis, made, it, possible, to, build, larger, organs, with, more, stops, more, variation, in, sound, and, timbre, and, more, divisions, for, instance, as, early, as, in, 1808, the, first, 32, contre, bombarde, was, installed, in, the, great, organ, of, nancy, cathedral, france, enclosed, divisions, became, common, and, registration, aids, were, developed, to, make, it, easier, for, the, organist, to, manage, the, great, number, of, stops, the, desire, for, louder, grander, organs, required, that, the, stops, be, voiced, on, a, higher, wind, pressure, than, before, as, a, result, a, greater, force, was, required, to, overcome, the, wind, pressure, and, depress, the, keys, to, solve, this, problem, cavaill, coll, configured, the, english, barker, lever, to, assist, in, operating, the, key, action, this, is, essentially, a, servomechanism, that, uses, wind, pressure, from, the, air, plenum, to, augment, the, force, that, is, exerted, by, the, player, s, fingers, organ, builders, began, to, prefer, specifications, with, fewer, mixtures, and, high, pitched, stops, more, 8, and, 16, stops, and, wider, pipe, scales, these, practices, created, a, warmer, richer, sound, than, was, common, in, the, 18th, century, organs, began, to, be, built, in, concert, halls, such, as, the, organ, at, the, palais, du, trocad, ro, in, paris, and, composers, such, as, camille, saint, sa, ns, and, gustav, mahler, used, the, organ, in, their, orchestral, works, the, development, of, pneumatic, and, electro, pneumatic, key, actions, in, the, late, 19th, century, made, it, possible, to, locate, the, console, independently, of, the, pipes, greatly, expanding, the, possibilities, in, organ, design, electric, stop, actions, were, also, developed, which, allowed, sophisticated, combination, actions, to, be, created, beginning, in, the, early, 20th, century, in, germany, and, in, the, mid, 20th, century, in, the, united, states, organ, builders, began, to, build, historically, inspired, instruments, modeled, on, baroque, organs, they, returned, to, building, mechanical, key, actions, voicing, with, lower, wind, pressures, and, thinner, pipe, scales, and, designing, specifications, with, more, mixture, stops, this, became, known, as, the, organ, reform, movement, in, the, late, 20th, century, organ, builders, began, to, incorporate, digital, components, into, their, key, stop, and, combination, actions, besides, making, these, mechanisms, simpler, and, more, reliable, this, also, makes, it, possible, to, record, and, play, back, an, organist, s, performance, using, the, midi, protocol, in, addition, some, organ, builders, have, incorporated, digital, electronic, stops, into, their, pipe, organs, the, electronic, organ, developed, throughout, the, 20th, century, some, pipe, organs, were, replaced, by, digital, organs, because, of, their, lower, purchase, price, smaller, physical, size, and, minimal, maintenance, requirements, in, the, early, 1970s, rodgers, instruments, pioneered, the, hybrid, organ, an, electronic, instrument, that, incorporates, real, pipes, other, builders, such, as, allen, organs, and, johannus, orgelbouw, have, since, built, hybrid, organs, allen, organs, first, introduced, the, electronic, organ, in, 1937, and, in, 1971, created, the, first, digital, organ, using, cmos, technology, borrowed, from, nasa, which, created, the, digital, pipe, organ, using, sound, recorded, from, actual, speaking, pipes, and, incorporating, the, sounds, electronically, within, the, memory, of, the, digital, organ, thus, having, real, pipe, organ, sound, without, the, actual, organ, pipes, a, pipe, organ, contains, one, or, more, sets, of, pipes, a, wind, system, and, one, or, more, keyboards, the, pipes, produce, sound, when, pressurized, air, produced, by, the, wind, system, passes, through, them, an, action, connects, the, keyboards, to, the, pipes, stops, allow, the, organist, to, control, which, ranks, of, pipes, sound, at, a, given, time, the, organist, operates, the, stops, and, the, keyboards, from, the, console, organ, pipes, are, made, from, either, wood, or, metal, and, produce, sound, speak, when, air, under, pressure, wind, is, directed, through, them, as, one, pipe, produces, a, single, pitch, multiple, pipes, are, necessary, to, accommodate, the, musical, scale, the, greater, the, length, of, the, pipe, the, lower, its, resulting, pitch, will, be, the, timbre, and, volume, of, the, sound, produced, by, a, pipe, depends, on, the, volume, of, air, delivered, to, the, pipe, and, the, manner, in, which, it, is, constructed, and, voiced, the, latter, adjusted, by, the, builder, to, produce, the, desired, tone, and, volume, hence, a, pipe, s, volume, cannot, be, readily, changed, while, playing, organ, pipes, are, divided, into, flue, pipes, and, reed, pipes, according, to, their, design, and, timbre, flue, pipes, produce, sound, by, forcing, air, through, a, fipple, like, that, of, a, recorder, whereas, reed, pipes, produce, sound, via, a, beating, reed, like, that, of, a, clarinet, or, saxophone, pipes, are, arranged, by, timbre, and, pitch, into, ranks, a, rank, is, a, set, of, pipes, of, the, same, timbre, but, multiple, pitches, one, for, each, note, on, the, keyboard, which, is, mounted, usually, vertically, onto, a, windchest, the, stop, mechanism, admits, air, to, each, rank, for, a, given, pipe, to, sound, the, stop, governing, the, pipe, s, rank, must, be, engaged, and, the, key, corresponding, to, its, pitch, must, be, depressed, ranks, of, pipes, are, organized, into, groups, called, divisions, each, division, generally, is, played, from, its, own, keyboard, and, conceptually, comprises, an, individual, instrument, within, the, organ, an, organ, contains, two, actions, or, systems, of, moving, parts, the, keys, and, the, stops, the, key, action, causes, wind, to, be, admitted, into, an, organ, pipe, while, a, key, is, depressed, the, stop, action, causes, a, rank, of, pipes, to, be, engaged, i, e, playable, by, the, keys, while, a, stop, is, in, its, on, position, an, action, may, be, mechanical, pneumatic, or, electrical, or, some, combination, of, these, such, as, electro, pneumatic, the, key, action, is, independent, of, the, stop, action, allowing, an, organ, to, combine, a, mechanical, key, action, with, an, electric, stop, action, a, key, action, in, which, the, keys, are, connected, to, the, windchests, by, only, rods, and, levers, is, a, mechanical, or, tracker, action, when, the, organist, depresses, a, key, the, corresponding, rod, called, a, tracker, pulls, open, its, pallet, allowing, wind, to, enter, the, pipe, in, a, mechanical, stop, action, each, stop, control, operates, a, valve, for, a, whole, rank, of, pipes, when, the, organist, selects, a, stop, the, valve, allows, wind, to, reach, the, selected, rank, the, first, kind, of, control, used, for, this, purpose, was, a, draw, stop, knob, which, the, organist, selects, by, pulling, or, drawing, toward, himself, herself, pulling, all, of, the, knobs, thus, activates, all, available, pipes, and, is, the, origin, of, the, idiom, to, pull, out, all, the, stops, more, modern, stop, selectors, utilized, in, electric, actions, are, ordinary, electrical, switches, and, or, magnetic, valves, operated, by, a, rocker, tab, tracker, action, has, been, used, from, antiquity, to, modern, times, before, the, pallet, opens, wind, pressure, augments, tension, of, the, pallet, spring, but, once, the, pallet, opens, only, the, spring, tension, is, felt, at, the, key, this, sudden, decrease, of, key, pressure, against, the, finger, provides, a, breakaway, feel, a, later, development, was, the, tubular, pneumatic, action, which, uses, changes, of, pressure, within, lead, tubing, to, operate, pneumatic, valves, throughout, the, instrument, this, allowed, a, lighter, touch, and, more, flexibility, in, the, location, of, the, console, within, a, roughly, 50, foot, 15, m, limit, this, type, of, construction, was, used, in, the, late, 19th, century, and, early, 20th, century, and, has, had, only, rare, application, since, the, 1920s, a, more, recent, development, is, the, electric, action, which, uses, low, voltage, dc, to, control, the, key, and, or, stop, mechanisms, electricity, may, control, the, action, indirectly, by, activating, air, pressure, valves, pneumatics, in, which, case, the, action, is, electro, pneumatic, in, such, actions, an, electromagnet, attracts, a, small, pilot, valve, which, lets, wind, go, to, a, bellows, the, pneumatic, component, which, opens, the, pallet, when, electricity, operates, the, action, directly, without, the, assistance, of, pneumatics, it, is, commonly, referred, to, as, direct, electric, action, in, this, type, the, electromagnet, s, armature, carries, a, disc, pallet, when, electrical, wiring, alone, is, used, to, connect, the, console, to, the, windchest, electric, actions, allow, the, console, to, be, separated, at, any, practical, distance, from, the, rest, of, the, organ, and, to, be, movable, electric, stop, actions, can, be, controlled, at, the, console, by, stop, knobs, by, pivoted, tilting, tablets, or, rocker, tabs, these, are, simple, switches, like, wall, switches, for, room, lights, some, may, include, electromagnets, for, automatic, setting, or, resetting, when, combinations, are, selected, computers, have, made, it, possible, to, connect, the, console, and, windchests, using, narrow, data, cables, instead, of, the, much, larger, bundles, of, simple, electric, cables, embedded, computers, in, the, console, and, near, the, windchests, communicate, with, each, other, via, various, complex, multiplexing, syntaxes, comparable, to, midi, the, wind, system, consists, of, the, parts, that, produce, store, and, deliver, wind, to, the, pipes, pipe, organ, wind, pressures, are, on, the, order, of, 0, 10, psi, 0, 69, kpa, organ, builders, traditionally, measure, organ, wind, using, a, water, u, tube, manometer, which, gives, the, pressure, as, the, difference, in, water, levels, in, the, two, legs, of, the, manometer, the, difference, in, water, level, is, proportional, to, the, difference, in, pressure, between, the, wind, and, the, atmosphere, the, 0, 10, psi, above, would, register, as, 2, 75, inches, of, water, 70, mmaq, an, italian, organ, from, the, renaissance, period, may, be, on, only, 2, 2, inches, 56, mm, while, in, the, extreme, solo, stops, in, some, large, 20th, century, organs, may, require, up, to, 50, inches, 1, 300, mm, in, isolated, extreme, cases, some, stops, have, been, voiced, on, 100, inches, 2, 500, mm, with, the, exception, of, water, organs, playing, the, organ, before, the, invention, of, motors, required, at, least, one, person, to, operate, the, bellows, when, signaled, by, the, organist, a, calcant, would, operate, a, set, of, bellows, supplying, the, organ, with, wind, rather, than, hire, a, calcant, an, organist, might, practise, on, some, other, instrument, such, as, a, clavichord, or, harpsichord, by, the, mid, 19th, century, bellows, were, also, operated, by, water, engines, steam, engines, or, gasoline, engines, starting, in, the, 1860s, bellows, were, gradually, replaced, by, rotating, turbines, which, were, later, directly, connected, to, electrical, motors, this, made, it, possible, for, organists, to, practice, regularly, on, the, organ, most, organs, both, new, and, historic, have, electric, blowers, although, some, can, still, be, operated, manually, the, wind, supplied, is, stored, in, one, or, more, regulators, to, maintain, a, constant, pressure, in, the, windchests, until, the, action, allows, it, to, flow, into, the, pipes, each, stop, usually, controls, one, rank, of, pipes, although, mixtures, and, undulating, stops, such, as, the, voix, c, leste, control, multiple, ranks, the, name, of, the, stop, reflects, not, only, the, stop, s, timbre, and, construction, but, also, the, style, of, the, organ, in, which, it, resides, for, example, the, names, on, an, organ, built, in, the, north, german, baroque, style, generally, will, be, derived, from, the, german, language, while, the, names, of, similar, stops, on, an, organ, in, the, french, romantic, style, will, usually, be, french, most, countries, tend, to, use, only, their, own, languages, for, stop, nomenclature, english, speaking, nations, as, well, as, japan, are, more, receptive, to, foreign, nomenclature, stop, names, are, not, standardized, two, otherwise, identical, stops, from, different, organs, may, have, different, names, to, facilitate, a, large, range, of, timbres, organ, stops, exist, at, different, pitch, levels, a, stop, that, sounds, at, unison, pitch, when, a, key, is, depressed, is, called, an, 8, pronounced, eight, foot, pitch, this, refers, to, the, speaking, length, of, the, lowest, sounding, pipe, in, that, rank, which, is, approximately, eight, feet, 2, 4, m, for, the, same, reason, a, stop, that, sounds, an, octave, higher, is, at, 4, pitch, and, one, that, sounds, two, octaves, higher, is, at, 2, pitch, likewise, a, stop, that, sounds, an, octave, lower, than, unison, pitch, is, at, 16, pitch, and, one, that, sounds, two, octaves, lower, is, at, 32, pitch, stops, of, different, pitch, levels, are, designed, to, be, played, simultaneously, the, label, on, a, stop, knob, or, rocker, tab, indicates, the, stop, s, name, and, its, pitch, in, feet, stops, that, control, multiple, ranks, display, a, roman, numeral, indicating, the, number, of, ranks, present, instead, of, pitch, thus, a, stop, labelled, open, diapason, 8, is, a, single, rank, diapason, stop, sounding, at, 8, pitch, a, stop, labelled, mixture, v, is, a, five, rank, mixture, sometimes, a, single, rank, of, pipes, may, be, able, to, be, controlled, by, several, stops, allowing, the, rank, to, be, played, at, multiple, pitches, or, on, multiple, manuals, such, a, rank, is, said, to, be, unified, or, borrowed, for, example, an, 8, diapason, rank, may, also, be, made, available, as, a, 4, octave, when, both, of, these, stops, are, selected, and, a, key, for, example, c, is, pressed, two, pipes, of, the, same, rank, will, sound, the, pipe, normally, corresponding, to, the, key, played, c, and, the, pipe, one, octave, above, that, c, because, the, 8, rank, does, not, have, enough, pipes, to, sound, the, top, octave, of, the, keyboard, at, 4, pitch, it, is, common, for, an, extra, octave, of, pipes, used, only, for, the, borrowed, 4, stop, to, be, added, in, this, case, the, full, rank, of, pipes, now, an, extended, rank, is, one, octave, longer, than, the, keyboard, special, unpitched, stops, also, appear, in, some, organs, among, these, are, the, zimbelstern, a, wheel, of, rotating, bells, the, nightingale, a, pipe, submerged, in, a, small, pool, of, water, creating, the, sound, of, a, bird, warbling, when, wind, is, admitted, and, the, effet, d, orage, thunder, effect, a, device, that, sounds, the, lowest, bass, pipes, simultaneously, standard, orchestral, percussion, instruments, such, as, the, drum, chimes, celesta, and, harp, have, also, been, imitated, in, organ, building, the, controls, available, to, the, organist, including, the, keyboards, couplers, expression, pedals, stops, and, registration, aids, are, accessed, from, the, console, the, console, is, either, built, into, the, organ, case, or, detached, from, it, keyboards, played, by, the, hands, are, known, as, manuals, from, the, latin, manus, meaning, hand, the, keyboard, played, by, the, feet, is, a, pedalboard, from, the, latin, pes, pedis, meaning, foot, every, organ, has, at, least, one, manual, most, have, two, or, more, and, most, have, a, pedalboard, each, keyboard, is, named, for, a, particular, division, of, the, organ, a, group, of, ranks, and, generally, controls, only, the, stops, from, that, division, the, range, of, the, keyboards, has, varied, widely, across, time, and, between, countries, most, current, specifications, call, for, two, or, more, manuals, with, sixty, one, notes, five, octaves, from, c, to, c, and, a, pedalboard, with, thirty, or, thirty, two, notes, two, and, a, half, octaves, from, c, to, f, or, g, a, coupler, allows, the, stops, of, one, division, to, be, played, from, the, keyboard, of, another, division, for, example, a, coupler, labelled, swell, to, great, allows, the, stops, drawn, in, the, swell, division, to, be, played, on, the, great, manual, this, coupler, is, a, unison, coupler, because, it, causes, the, pipes, of, the, swell, division, to, sound, at, the, same, pitch, as, the, keys, played, on, the, great, manual, coupling, allows, stops, from, different, divisions, to, be, combined, to, create, various, tonal, effects, it, also, allows, every, stop, of, the, organ, to, be, played, simultaneously, from, one, manual, octave, couplers, which, add, the, pipes, an, octave, above, super, octave, or, below, sub, octave, each, note, that, is, played, may, operate, on, one, division, only, for, example, the, swell, super, octave, which, adds, the, octave, above, what, is, played, on, the, swell, to, itself, or, act, as, a, coupler, to, another, keyboard, for, example, the, swell, super, octave, to, great, which, adds, to, the, great, manual, the, ranks, of, the, swell, division, an, octave, above, what, is, played, in, addition, larger, organs, may, use, unison, off, couplers, which, prevent, the, stops, pulled, in, a, particular, division, from, sounding, at, their, normal, pitch, these, can, be, used, in, combination, with, octave, couplers, to, create, innovative, aural, effects, and, can, also, be, used, to, rearrange, the, order, of, the, manuals, to, make, specific, pieces, easier, to, play, enclosure, refers, to, a, system, that, allows, for, the, control, of, volume, without, requiring, the, addition, or, subtraction, of, stops, in, a, two, manual, organ, with, great, and, swell, divisions, the, swell, will, be, enclosed, in, larger, organs, parts, or, all, of, the, choir, and, solo, divisions, may, also, be, enclosed, the, pipes, of, an, enclosed, division, are, placed, in, a, chamber, generally, called, the, swell, box, at, least, one, side, of, the, box, is, constructed, from, horizontal, or, vertical, palettes, known, as, swell, shades, which, operate, in, a, similar, way, to, venetian, blinds, their, position, can, be, adjusted, from, the, console, when, the, swell, shades, are, open, more, sound, is, heard, than, when, they, are, closed, sometimes, the, shades, are, exposed, but, they, are, often, concealed, behind, a, row, of, facade, pipes, or, a, grill, the, most, common, method, of, controlling, the, louvers, is, the, balanced, swell, pedal, this, device, is, usually, placed, above, the, centre, of, the, pedalboard, and, is, configured, to, rotate, away, from, the, organist, from, a, near, vertical, position, in, which, the, shades, are, closed, to, a, near, horizontal, position, in, which, the, shades, are, open, an, organ, may, also, have, a, similar, looking, crescendo, pedal, found, alongside, any, expression, pedals, pressing, the, crescendo, pedal, forward, cumulatively, activates, the, stops, of, the, organ, starting, with, the, softest, and, ending, with, the, loudest, pressing, it, backward, reverses, this, process, organ, stops, can, be, combined, in, many, permutations, resulting, in, a, great, variety, of, sounds, a, combination, action, can, be, used, to, switch, instantly, from, one, combination, of, stops, called, a, registration, to, another, combination, actions, feature, small, buttons, called, pistons, that, can, be, pressed, by, the, organist, generally, located, beneath, the, keys, of, each, manual, thumb, pistons, or, above, the, pedalboard, toe, pistons, the, pistons, may, be, divisional, affecting, only, a, single, division, or, general, affecting, all, the, divisions, and, are, either, preset, by, the, organ, builder, or, can, be, altered, by, the, organist, modern, combination, actions, operate, via, computer, memory, and, can, store, several, channels, of, registrations, the, pipes, action, and, wind, system, are, almost, always, contained, in, a, case, the, design, of, which, also, may, incorporate, the, console, the, case, blends, the, organ, s, sound, and, aids, in, projecting, it, into, the, room, the, case, is, often, designed, to, complement, the, building, s, architectural, style, and, it, may, contain, ornamental, carvings, and, other, decorations, the, visible, portion, of, the, case, called, the, fa, ade, will, most, often, contain, pipes, which, may, be, either, sounding, pipes, or, dummy, pipes, solely, for, decoration, the, fa, ade, pipes, may, be, plain, burnished, gilded, or, painted, and, are, usually, referred, to, as, en, montre, within, the, context, of, the, french, organ, school, organ, cases, occasionally, feature, a, few, ranks, of, pipes, protruding, horizontally, from, the, case, in, the, manner, of, a, row, of, trumpets, these, are, referred, to, as, pipes, en, chamade, and, are, particularly, common, in, organs, of, the, iberian, peninsula, and, large, 20th, century, instruments, many, organs, particularly, those, built, in, the, early, 20th, century, are, contained, in, one, or, more, rooms, called, organ, chambers, because, sound, does, not, project, from, a, chamber, into, the, room, as, clearly, as, from, a, freestanding, organ, case, enchambered, organs, may, sound, muffled, and, distant, for, this, reason, some, modern, builders, particularly, those, building, instruments, specializing, in, polyphony, rather, than, romantic, compositions, avoid, this, unless, the, architecture, of, the, room, makes, it, necessary, the, goal, of, tuning, a, pipe, organ, is, to, adjust, the, pitch, of, each, pipe, so, that, they, all, sound, in, tune, with, each, other, how, the, pitch, of, each, pipe, is, adjusted, depends, on, the, type, and, construction, of, that, pipe, regulation, adjusts, the, action, so, that, all, pipes, sound, correctly, if, the, regulation, is, wrongly, set, the, keys, may, be, at, different, heights, some, pipes, may, sound, when, the, keys, are, not, pressed, a, cipher, or, pipes, may, not, sound, when, a, key, is, pressed, tracker, action, for, example, in, the, organ, of, cradley, heath, baptist, church, includes, adjustment, nuts, on, the, wire, ends, of, the, wooden, trackers, which, have, the, effect, of, changing, the, effective, length, of, each, tracker, the, main, development, of, organ, repertoire, has, progressed, along, with, that, of, the, organ, itself, leading, to, distinctive, national, styles, of, composition, because, organs, are, commonly, found, in, churches, and, synagogues, the, organ, repertoire, includes, a, large, amount, of, sacred, music, which, is, accompanimental, choral, anthems, congregational, hymns, liturgical, elements, etc, as, well, as, solo, in, nature, chorale, preludes, hymn, versets, designed, for, alternatim, use, etc, the, organ, s, secular, repertoire, includes, preludes, fugues, sonatas, organ, symphonies, suites, and, transcriptions, of, orchestral, works, although, most, countries, whose, music, falls, into, the, western, tradition, have, contributed, to, the, organ, repertoire, france, and, germany, in, particular, have, produced, exceptionally, large, amounts, of, organ, music, there, is, also, an, extensive, repertoire, from, the, netherlands, england, and, the, united, states, before, the, baroque, era, keyboard, music, generally, was, not, written, for, one, instrument, or, another, but, rather, was, written, to, be, played, on, any, keyboard, instrument, for, this, reason, much, of, the, organ, s, repertoire, through, the, renaissance, period, is, the, same, as, that, of, the, harpsichord, pre, renaissance, keyboard, music, is, found, in, compiled, manuscripts, that, may, include, compositions, from, a, variety, of, regions, the, oldest, of, these, sources, is, the, robertsbridge, codex, dating, from, about, 1360, the, buxheimer, orgelbuch, which, dates, from, about, 1470, and, was, compiled, in, germany, includes, intabulations, of, vocal, music, by, the, english, composer, john, dunstaple, the, earliest, italian, organ, music, is, found, in, the, faenza, codex, dating, from, 1420, in, the, renaissance, period, dutch, composers, such, as, jan, pieterszoon, sweelinck, composed, both, fantasias, and, psalm, settings, sweelinck, in, particular, developed, a, rich, collection, of, keyboard, figuration, that, influenced, subsequent, composers, the, italian, composer, claudio, merulo, wrote, in, the, typical, italian, genres, of, the, toccata, the, canzona, and, the, ricercar, in, spain, the, works, of, antonio, de, cabez, n, began, the, most, prolific, period, of, spanish, organ, composition, which, culminated, with, juan, cabanilles, early, baroque, organ, music, in, germany, was, highly, contrapuntal, sacred, organ, music, was, based, on, chorales, composers, such, as, samuel, scheidt, and, heinrich, scheidemann, wrote, chorale, preludes, chorale, fantasias, and, chorale, motets, near, the, end, of, the, baroque, era, the, chorale, prelude, and, the, partita, became, mixed, forming, the, chorale, partita, this, genre, was, developed, by, georg, b, hm, johann, pachelbel, and, dieterich, buxtehude, the, primary, type, of, free, form, piece, in, this, period, was, the, praeludium, as, exemplified, in, the, works, of, matthias, weckmann, nicolaus, bruhns, b, hm, and, buxtehude, the, organ, music, of, johann, sebastian, bach, fused, characteristics, of, every, national, tradition, and, historical, style, in, his, large, scale, preludes, and, fugues, and, chorale, based, works, george, frideric, handel, composed, the, first, organ, concertos, in, france, organ, music, developed, during, the, baroque, era, through, the, music, of, jean, titelouze, fran, ois, couperin, and, nicolas, de, grigny, because, the, french, organ, of, the, 17th, and, early, 18th, centuries, was, very, standardized, a, conventional, set, of, registrations, developed, for, its, repertoire, the, music, of, french, composers, and, italian, composers, such, as, girolamo, frescobaldi, was, written, for, use, during, the, mass, very, little, secular, organ, music, was, composed, in, france, and, italy, during, the, baroque, period, the, written, repertoire, is, almost, exclusively, intended, for, liturgical, use, in, england, composers, such, as, john, blow, and, john, stanley, wrote, multi, sectional, free, works, for, liturgical, use, called, voluntaries, through, the, 19th, century, organ, music, was, seldom, written, in, the, classical, era, as, composers, preferred, the, piano, with, its, ability, to, create, dynamics, in, germany, the, six, sonatas, op, 65, of, felix, mendelssohn, published, 1845, marked, the, beginning, of, a, renewed, interest, in, composing, for, the, organ, inspired, by, the, newly, built, cavaill, coll, organs, the, french, organist, composers, c, sar, franck, alexandre, guilmant, and, charles, marie, widor, led, organ, music, into, the, symphonic, realm, the, development, of, symphonic, organ, music, continued, with, louis, vierne, and, charles, tournemire, widor, and, vierne, wrote, large, scale, multi, movement, works, called, organ, symphonies, that, exploited, the, full, possibilities, of, the, symphonic, organ, such, as, widor, s, symphony, for, organ, no, 6, and, vierne, s, organ, symphony, no, 3, max, reger, and, sigfrid, karg, elert, s, symphonic, works, made, use, of, the, abilities, of, the, large, romantic, organs, then, built, in, germany, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, organ, builders, began, to, build, instruments, in, concert, halls, and, other, large, secular, venues, allowing, the, organ, to, be, used, as, part, of, an, orchestra, as, in, saint, sa, ns, symphony, no, 3, sometimes, known, as, the, organ, symphony, frequently, the, organ, is, given, a, soloistic, part, such, as, in, joseph, jongen, s, symphonie, concertante, for, organ, orchestra, francis, poulenc, s, concerto, for, organ, strings, and, tympani, and, frigyes, hidas, organ, concerto, other, composers, who, have, used, the, organ, prominently, in, orchestral, music, include, gustav, holst, richard, strauss, ottorino, respighi, gustav, mahler, anton, bruckner, and, ralph, vaughan, williams, because, these, concert, hall, instruments, could, approximate, the, sounds, of, symphony, orchestras, transcriptions, of, orchestral, works, found, a, place, in, the, organ, repertoire, as, silent, films, became, popular, theatre, organs, were, installed, in, theatres, to, provide, accompaniment, for, the, films, in, the, 20th, century, symphonic, repertoire, both, sacred, and, secular, continued, to, progress, through, the, music, of, marcel, dupr, maurice, durufl, and, herbert, howells, other, composers, such, as, olivier, messiaen, gy, rgy, ligeti, jehan, alain, jean, langlais, gerd, zacher, and, petr, eben, wrote, post, tonal, organ, music, messiaen, s, music, in, particular, redefined, many, of, the, traditional, notions, of, organ, registration, and, technique, albert, schweitzer, was, an, organist, who, studied, the, music, of, german, composer, johann, sebastian, bach, and, influenced, the, organ, reform, movement, music, director, hans, zimmer, used, pipe, organ, in, the, movie, interstellar, for, the, leading, background, score, the, final, recording, took, place, in, london, s, temple, church, on, 1926, four, manual, harrison, and, harrison, organ
