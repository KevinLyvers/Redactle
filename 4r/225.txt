goscinny, had, a, different, picture, in, his, mind, visualizing, asterix, as, a, shrewd, compact, warrior, who, would, possess, intelligence, and, wit, more, than, raw, strength, however, uderzo, felt, that, the, downsized, hero, needed, a, strong, but, dim, companion, to, which, goscinny, agreed, hence, obelix, was, born, despite, the, growing, popularity, of, asterix, with, the, readers,

and, slower, thinking, friend, obelix, who, because, he, fell, into, the, druid, s, cauldron, of, the, potion, as, a, baby, has, permanent, superhuman, strength, because, of, this, getafix, steadfastly, refuses, to, allow, obelix, to, drink, the, potion, as, doing, so, would, have, a, dangerous, and, unpredictable, result, as, shown, in, asterix, and, obelix, all, at, sea, obelix, is, usually, accompanied, by, dogmatix, his, little, dog, except, for, asterix, and, obelix, the, names, of, the, characters, change, with, the, language, for, example, obelix, s, dog, s, name, is, id,

such, as, in, asterix, and, cleopatra, the, humour, encountered, in, the, asterix, comics, often, centers, around, puns, caricatures, and, tongue, in, cheek, stereotypes, of, contemporary, european, nations, and, french, regions, much, of, the, multi, layered, humour, in, the, initial, asterix, books, was, french, specific, which, delayed, the, translation, of, the, books, into, other, languages, for, fear, of, losing, the, jokes, and, the, spirit, of, the, story, some, translations, have, actually, added, local, humour, in, the, italian, translation, the, roman, legionaries, are, made, to, speak, in, 20th, century, roman, dialect, and, obelix, s, famous, ils, sont, fous, ces, romains, these, romans, are, crazy, is, translated, properly, as, sono, pazzi, questi, romani, humorously, alluding, to, the, roman, abbreviation, spqr, in, another, example, hiccups, are, written, onomatopoeically, in, french, as, hips, but, in, english, as, hic, allowing, roman, legionaries, in, more, than, one, of, the, english, translations, to, decline, their, hiccups, absurdly, in, latin, hic, haec, hoc, the, newer, albums, share, a, more, universal, humour, both, written, and, visual, all, the, fictional, characters, in, asterix, have, names, which, are, puns, on, their, roles, or, personalities, and, which, follow, certain, patterns, specific, to, nationality, certain, rules, are, followed, most, of, the, time, such, as, gauls, and, their, neighbours, having, an, ix, suffix, for, the, men, and, ending, in, a, for, the, women, for, example, chief, vitalstatistix, so, called, due, to, his, portly, stature, and, his, wife, impedimenta, often, at, odds, with, the, chief, the, male, roman, names, end, in, us, echoing, latin, nominative, male, singular, form, as, in, gluteus, maximus, a, muscle, bound, athlete, whose, name, is, literally, the, butt, of, the, joke, gothic, names, present, day, germany, end, in, ic, after, gothic, chiefs, such, as, alaric, and, theoderic,

of, normans, end, with, af, for, example, nescaf, or, cenotaf, egyptian, characters, often, end, in, is, such, as, the, architects, edifis, and, artifis, and, the, scribe, exlibris, indic, names, apart, from, the, only, indic, female, characters, orinjade, and, lemuhnade, exhibit, considerable, variation, examples, include, watziznehm, watzit, owzat, and, howdoo, other, nationalities, are, treated, to, pidgin, translations, from, their, language, like, huevos, y, bacon, a, spanish, chieftain, whose, name, meaning, eggs, and, bacon, is, often, guidebook, spanish, for, tourists, or, literary, and, other, popular, media, references, like, dubbelosix, a, sly, reference, to, james, bond, s, codename, 007, most, of, these, jokes, and, hence, the, names, of, the, characters, are, specific, to, the, translation, for, example, the, druid, named, getafix, in, english, translation, get, a, fix, referring, to, the, character, s, role, in, dispensing, the, magic, potion, is, panoramix, in, the, original, french, and, miraculix, in, german, even, so, occasionally, the, wordplay, has, been, preserved, obelix, s, dog, known, in, the, original, french, as, id, fix, from, id, e, fixe, a, fixed, idea, or, obsession, is, called, dogmatix, in, english, which, not, only, renders, the, original, meaning, strikingly, closely, dogmatic, but, in, fact, adds, another, layer, of,

exceptions, include, icelandic, in, which, he, is, known, as, str, kur, rich, of, love, and, sinhala, where, he, is, known, as, soora, pappa, which, can, be, interpreted, as, hero, the, name, obelix, ob, lix, may, refer, to, obelisk, a, stone, column, from, ancient, egypt, and, hence, his, large, size, and, strength, and, his, task, of, carrying, around, menhirs, but, also, to, another,
