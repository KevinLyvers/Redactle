as, either, kh, mush, silence, or, shams, i, tabrizi, although, he, had, belonged, to, a, long, tradition, of, sufi, poetry, rumi, developed, his, own, unique, style, notably, due, to, the, extemporaneous, manner, in, which, rumi, composed, his, poems, much, of, rumi, s, poetry, has, an, ecstatic, almost, trance, like, style, that, differs, from, the, works, of, other, professional, islamic, poets, rumi, evidently, found, the, traditional, metrical, constraints, of, ghazals, to, be, constraining, lamenting, in, one, ghazal, that, fitting, his, poems, into, the, traditional, dum, ta, ta, dum, ghazal, metre, was, a, process, so, dreadful, that, it, nearly, killed, him, in, 1244, c, e, rumi, then, a, jurist, and, spiritual, counselor, working, at, the, behest, of, the, seljuk, sultan, of, r, m, met, a, wandering, persian, sufi, dervish, named, shams, i, tabrizi, in, konya, rumi, who, previously, had, no, background, in, poetics, quickly, became, attached, to, shams, who, acted, as, a, spiritual, teacher, to, rumi, and, introduced, him, to, music, sung, poetry, and, dance, through, sufi, samas, shams, abruptly, left, konya, in, 1246, c, e, returned, a, year, later, then, vanished, again, in, 1248, c, e, possibly, having, been, murdered, during, shams, initial, separation, from, rumi, rumi, wrote, poetic, letters, to, shams, pleading, for, his, return, following, shams, second, disappearance, rumi, returned, to, writing, poetry, lauding, shams, and, lamenting, his, disappearance, these, poems, would, be, collected, after, rumi, s, death, by, his, students, as, the, divan, i, shams, i, tabrizi, the, creation, dates, of, some, of, the, poems, in, the, divan, are, unknown, however, a, major, portion, of, the, divan, s, poems, were, written, in, the, initial, aftermath, of, sham, s, second, disappearance, therefore, most, of, the, poems, probably, date, from, around, 1247, c, e, and, the, years, that, followed, until, rumi, had, overcome, his, grief, over, the, loss, of, shams, another, seventy, poems, in, the, divan, were, written, after, rumi, had, confirmed, that, shams, was, dead, rumi, dedicated, these, poems, to, his, friend, salah, al, din, zarkub, who, died, in, december, 1258, by, the, sixteenth, century, most, editors, organized, the, poems, in, the, divan, by, alphabetical, order, according, to, the, last, letter, of, each, line, disregarding, the, varying, meters, and, topics, of, the, poems, this, method, for, arranging, lyrical, poems, in, the, divan, is, still, used, in, modern, iranian, editions, of, the, divan, turkish, editions, however, follow, the, practice, of, the, mevlevi, order, and, group, the, poems, by, metre, the, first, printed, copy, of, the, divan, was, made, in, europe, in, 1838, by, vincenz, von, rosenzweig, schwannau, who, printed, seventy, five, poems, of, dubious, authenticity, reynold, a, nicholson, produced, a, more, selective, text, of, fifty, ghazals, from, the, divan, although, badi, al, zaman, foruzanfar, s, critical, edition, has, since, determined, several, of, nicholson, s, selections, to, have, been, inauthentic, in, 1957, foruzanfar, published, a, critical, collection, of, the, divan, s, poems, based, upon, manuscripts, written, within, a, hundred, years, of, rumi, s, death, although, the, divan, is, in, contrast, to, rumi, s, masnavi, not, a, didactic, work, it, is, still, a, deeply, philosophical, work, expressing, rumi, s, mystical, sufi, theology, among, the, more, prominent, themes, in, the, divan, are, those, of, love, and, longing, some, rumi, scholars, such, as, rokus, de, groot, argue, that, rumi, rejects, longing, in, favour, of, a, divine, unity, or, tawhid, a, concept, which, de, groot, considers, to, originate, in, the, shahada, s, declaration, that, there, is, no, other, god, save, god, according, to, de, groot, rumi, holds, that, longing, being, a, lust, to, grasp, something, beyond, oneself, necessarily, creates, a, duality, between, subjects, and, objects, thus, those, drunk, with, love, as, rumi, writes, are, double, whereas, those, drunk, with, god, are, united, as, one, de, groot, maintains, that, rumi, s, philosophy, of, the, oneness, of, love, explains, why, rumi, signed, about, a, third, of, the, divan, under, shams, i, tabrizi, s, name, by, writing, as, if, he, and, shams, were, the, same, person, rumi, repudiated, the, longing, that, plagued, him, after, shams, disappearance, in, favour, of, the, unity, of, all, beings, found, in, divine, love, in, contrast, mostafa, vaziri, argues, for, a, non, islamic, interpretation, of, rumi, in, vaziri, s, view, rumi, s, references, to, love, compose, a, separate, mazhab, e, ishq, or, religion, of, love, which, was, universalist, rather, than, uniquely, islamic, in, outlook, vaziri, posits, that, rumi, s, notion, of, love, was, a, designation, for, the, incorporeal, reality, of, existence, that, lies, outside, of, physical, conception, thus, according, to, vaziri, rumi, s, references, to, shams, in, the, divan, refer, not, to, the, person, of, shams, but, to, the, all, encompassing, universality, of, the, love, reality, the, divan, has, influenced, several, poets, and, writers, american, transcendentalists, such, as, ralph, waldo, emerson, and, walt, whitman, were, acquainted, with, the, divan, and, were, inspired, by, its, philosophical, mysticism, many, late, victorian, and, georgian, poets, in, england, were, also, acquainted, with, rumi, from, nicholson, s, translation, of, the, divan, prominent, rumi, interpreter, coleman, barks, has, used, selections, from, nevit, ergin, s, translation, of, the, divan, in, his, own, reinterpretations, of, rumi, albeit, with, controversy, as, to, the, accuracy, and, authenticity, of, barks, interpretation, publication, of, a, twenty, volume, english, translation, from, the, original, persian, by, jeffrey, r, osborne, was, completed, in, 2020
