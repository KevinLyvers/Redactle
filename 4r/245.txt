popol, vuh, also, popul, vuh, or, pop, vuj, is, a, text, recounting, the, mythology, and, history, of, the, k, iche, people, of, guatemala, one, of, the, maya, peoples, who, also, inhabit, the, mexican, states, of, chiapas, campeche, yucatan, and, quintana, roo, as, well, as, areas, of, belize, honduras, and, el, salvador, the, popol, vuh, is, a, foundational, sacred, narrative, of, the, k, iche, people, from, long, before, the, spanish, conquest, of, the, maya, it, includes, the, mayan, creation, myth, the, exploits, of, the, hero, twins, hunahp, and, xbalanqu, and, a, chronicle, of, the, k, iche, people, the, name, popol, vuh, translates, as, book, of, the, community, or, book, of, counsel, literally, book, that, pertains, to, the, mat, since, a, woven, mat, was, used, as, a, royal, throne, in, ancient, k, iche, society, and, symbolised, the, unity, of, the, community, it, was, originally, preserved, through, oral, tradition, until, approximately, 1550, when, it, was, recorded, in, writing, the, documentation, of, the, popol, vuh, is, credited, to, the, 18th, century, spanish, dominican, friar, francisco, xim, nez, who, prepared, a, manuscript, with, a, transcription, in, k, iche, and, parallel, columns, with, translations, into, spanish, like, the, chilam, balam, and, similar, texts, the, popol, vuh, is, of, particular, importance, given, the, scarcity, of, early, accounts, dealing, with, mesoamerican, mythologies, after, the, spanish, conquest, missionaries, and, colonists, destroyed, many, documents, in, 1701, francisco, xim, nez, a, dominican, priest, came, to, santo, tom, s, chichicastenango, also, known, as, santo, tom, s, chuil, this, town, was, in, the, quich, territory, and, is, likely, where, xim, nez, first, recorded, the, work, xim, nez, transcribed, and, translated, the, account, setting, up, parallel, k, iche, and, spanish, language, columns, in, his, manuscript, he, represented, the, k, iche, language, phonetically, with, latin, and, parra, characters, in, or, around, 1714, xim, nez, incorporated, the, spanish, content, in, book, one, chapters, 2, 21, of, his, historia, de, la, provincia, de, san, vicente, de, chiapa, y, guatemala, de, la, orden, de, predicadores, xim, nez, s, manuscripts, were, held, posthumously, by, the, dominican, order, until, general, francisco, moraz, n, expelled, the, clerics, from, guatemala, in, 1829, 30, at, that, time, the, order, s, documents, were, taken, over, largely, by, the, universidad, de, san, carlos, from, 1852, to, 1855, moritz, wagner, and, carl, scherzer, traveled, in, central, america, arriving, in, guatemala, city, in, early, may, 1854, scherzer, found, xim, nez, s, writings, in, the, university, library, noting, that, there, was, one, particular, item, del, mayor, inter, s, of, the, greatest, interest, with, assistance, from, the, guatemalan, historian, and, archivist, juan, gavarrete, scherzer, copied, or, had, a, copy, made, of, the, spanish, content, from, the, last, half, of, the, manuscript, which, he, published, upon, his, return, to, europe, in, 1855, french, abbot, charles, tienne, brasseur, de, bourbourg, also, came, across, xim, nez, s, manuscript, in, the, university, library, however, whereas, scherzer, copied, the, manuscript, brasseur, apparently, stole, the, university, s, volume, and, took, it, back, to, france, after, brasseur, s, death, in, 1874, the, mexico, guat, malienne, collection, containing, popol, vuh, passed, to, alphonse, pinart, through, whom, it, was, sold, to, edward, e, ayer, in, 1897, ayer, decided, to, donate, his, 17, 000, pieces, to, the, newberry, library, in, chicago, a, project, that, was, not, completed, until, 1911, father, xim, nez, s, transcription, translation, of, popol, vuh, was, among, ayer, s, donated, items, priest, xim, nez, s, manuscript, sank, into, obscurity, until, adri, n, recinos, rediscovered, it, at, the, newberry, in, 1941, recinos, is, generally, credited, with, finding, the, manuscript, and, publishing, the, first, direct, edition, since, scherzer, but, munro, edmonson, and, carlos, l, pez, attribute, the, first, rediscovery, to, walter, lehmann, in, 1928, experts, allen, christenson, n, stor, quiroa, rosa, helena, chinchilla, mazariegos, john, woodruff, and, carlos, l, pez, all, consider, the, newberry, volume, to, be, xim, nez, s, one, and, only, original, popol, vuh, is, also, spelled, as, popol, vuj, its, sound, in, spanish, use, is, close, to, german, term, for, book, buch, in, the, translation, of, title, meaning, by, adri, n, recinos, both, phonetics, and, etymology, connect, to, people, s, book, in, the, line, of, people, used, as, a, synonym, for, the, whole, nation, or, tribe, as, in, bible, book, of, lord, s, people, it, is, generally, believed, that, xim, nez, borrowed, a, phonetic, manuscript, from, a, parishioner, for, his, source, although, n, stor, quiroa, points, out, that, such, a, manuscript, has, never, been, found, and, thus, ximenez, s, work, represents, the, only, source, for, scholarly, studies, this, document, would, have, been, a, phonetic, rendering, of, an, oral, recitation, performed, in, or, around, santa, cruz, del, quich, shortly, following, pedro, de, alvarado, s, 1524, conquest, by, comparing, the, genealogy, at, the, end, of, popol, vuh, with, dated, colonial, records, adri, n, recinos, and, dennis, tedlock, suggest, a, date, between, 1554, and, 1558, but, to, the, extent, that, the, text, speaks, of, a, written, document, woodruff, cautions, that, critics, appear, to, have, taken, the, text, of, the, first, folio, recto, too, much, at, face, value, in, drawing, conclusions, about, popol, vuh, s, survival, if, there, was, an, early, post, conquest, document, one, theory, first, proposed, by, rudolf, schuller, ascribes, the, phonetic, authorship, to, diego, reynoso, one, of, the, signatories, of, the, t, tulo, de, totonicap, n, another, possible, author, could, have, been, don, crist, bal, velasco, who, also, in, titulo, de, totonicap, n, is, listed, as, nim, chokoh, cavec, great, steward, of, the, kaweq, in, either, case, the, colonial, presence, is, clear, in, popol, vuh, s, preamble, this, we, shall, write, now, under, the, law, of, god, and, christianity, we, shall, bring, it, to, light, because, now, the, popol, vuh, as, it, is, called, cannot, be, seen, any, more, in, which, was, clearly, seen, the, coming, from, the, other, side, of, the, sea, and, the, narration, of, our, obscurity, and, our, life, was, clearly, seen, accordingly, the, need, to, preserve, the, content, presupposes, an, imminent, disappearance, of, the, content, and, therefore, edmonson, theorized, a, pre, conquest, glyphic, codex, no, evidence, of, such, a, codex, has, yet, been, found, a, minority, however, disputes, the, existence, of, pre, xim, nez, texts, on, the, same, basis, that, is, used, to, argue, their, existence, both, positions, are, based, on, two, statements, by, xim, nez, the, first, of, these, comes, from, historia, de, la, provincia, where, xim, nez, writes, that, he, found, various, texts, during, his, curacy, of, santo, tom, s, chichicastenango, that, were, guarded, with, such, secrecy, that, not, even, a, trace, of, it, was, revealed, among, the, elder, ministers, although, almost, all, of, them, have, it, memorized, the, second, passage, used, to, argue, pre, xim, nez, texts, comes, from, xim, nez, s, addendum, to, popol, vuh, there, he, states, that, many, of, the, natives, practices, can, be, seen, in, a, book, that, they, have, something, like, a, prophecy, from, the, beginning, of, their, days, where, they, have, all, the, months, and, signs, corresponding, to, each, day, one, of, which, i, have, in, my, possession, scherzer, explains, in, a, footnote, that, what, xim, nez, is, referencing, is, only, a, secret, calendar, and, that, he, himself, had, found, this, rustic, calendar, previously, in, various, indigenous, towns, in, the, guatemalan, highlands, during, his, travels, with, wagner, this, presents, a, contradiction, because, the, item, which, xim, nez, has, in, his, possession, is, not, popol, vuh, and, a, carefully, guarded, item, is, not, likely, to, have, been, easily, available, to, xim, nez, apart, from, this, woodruff, surmises, that, because, ximenez, never, discloses, his, source, instead, inviting, readers, to, infer, what, they, wish, it, is, plausible, that, there, was, no, such, alphabetic, redaction, among, the, indians, the, implied, alternative, is, that, he, or, another, missionary, made, the, first, written, text, from, an, oral, recitation, many, versions, of, the, legend, of, the, hero, twins, hunahp, and, xbalanqu, circulated, through, the, maya, peoples, but, the, story, that, survives, was, preserved, by, the, dominican, priest, francisco, xim, nez, who, translated, the, document, between, 1700, and, 1715, maya, deities, in, the, post, classic, codices, differ, from, the, earlier, versions, described, in, the, early, classic, period, in, mayan, mythology, hunahp, and, xbalanqu, are, the, second, pair, of, twins, out, of, three, preceded, by, hun, hunahp, and, his, brother, vucub, hunahp, and, precursors, to, the, third, pair, of, twins, hun, batz, and, hun, chuen, in, the, popol, vuh, the, first, set, of, twins, hun, hunahp, and, vucub, hanahp, were, invited, to, the, mayan, underworld, xibalba, to, play, a, ballgame, with, the, xibalban, lords, in, the, underworld, the, twins, faced, many, trials, filled, with, trickery, eventually, they, fail, and, are, put, to, death, the, hero, twins, hunahp, and, xbalanqu, are, magically, conceived, after, the, death, of, their, father, hun, hunahp, and, in, time, they, return, to, xibalba, to, avenge, the, deaths, of, their, father, and, uncle, by, defeating, the, lords, of, the, underworld, popol, vuh, encompasses, a, range, of, subjects, that, includes, creation, ancestry, history, and, cosmology, there, are, no, content, divisions, in, the, newberry, library, s, holograph, but, popular, editions, have, adopted, the, organization, imposed, by, brasseur, de, bourbourg, in, 1861, in, order, to, facilitate, comparative, studies, though, some, variation, has, been, tested, by, dennis, tedlock, and, allen, christenson, editions, typically, take, the, following, form, preamble, book, one, book, two, book, three, book, four, a, visual, comparison, of, two, sections, of, the, popol, vuh, are, presented, below, and, include, the, original, k, iche,

in, the, belief, system, of, many, k, iche, although, catholicism, is, generally, seen, as, the, dominant, religion, some, believe, that, many, natives, practice, a, syncretic, blend, of, christian, and, indigenous, beliefs, some, stories, from, the, popol, vuh, continued, to, be, told, by, modern, maya, as, folk, legends, some, stories, recorded, by, anthropologists, in, the, 20th, century, may,
