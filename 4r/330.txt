of, the, 17th, century, in, most, countries, except, england, and, especially, france, where, they, survived, another, half, century, before, the, louder, violin, family, came, into, greater, favour, in, that, country, as, well, in, modern, symphony, orchestras, it, is, the, second, largest, stringed, instrument, the, double, bass, is, the, largest, thus, the, name, violoncello, contained, both,

voice, of, the, string, quartet, although, many, composers, give, it, a, melodic, role, as, well, as, well, as, being, part, of, many, other, chamber, groups, among, the, most, well, known, baroque, works, for, the, cello, are, johann, sebastian, bach, s, six, unaccompanied, suites, other, significant, works, include, sonatas, and, concertos, by, antonio, vivaldi, and, solo, sonatas, by, francesco, geminiani, and, giovanni, bononcini, domenico, gabrielli, was, one, of, the, first, composers, to, treat, the, cello, as, a, solo, instrument, as, a, basso, continuo, instrument, the, cello, may, have, been, used, in, works, by, francesca, caccini, 1587, 1641, barbara, strozzi, 1619, 1677, with, pieces, such, as, il, primo, libro, di, madrigali, per, 2, 5, voci, e, basso, continuo,

1970s, pop, and, disco, music, today, it, is, sometimes, featured, in, pop, and, rock, recordings, examples, of, which, are, noted, later, in, this, article, the, cello, has, also, appeared, in, major, hip, hop, and, r, b, performances, such, as, singers, rihanna, and, ne, yo, s, 2007, performance, at, the, american, music, awards, the, instrument, has, also, been, modified, for, indian, classical, music, by, nancy, lesh, and, saskia, rao, de, haas, the, violin, family, including, cello, sized, instruments, emerged, c, 1500, as, a, family, of, instruments, distinct, from, the, viola, da, gamba, family, the, earliest, depictions, of, the, violin, family, from, italy, c, 1530, show, three, sizes, of, instruments, roughly, corresponding, to, what, we, now, call, violins, violas, and, cellos, contrary, to, a, popular, misconception, the, cello, did, not, evolve, from, the, viola, da, gamba, but, existed, alongside, it, for, about, two, and, a, half, centuries, the, violin, family, is, also, known, as, the, viola, da, braccio, meaning, viola, for, the, arm, family, a, reference, to, the, primary, way, the, members, of, the, family, are, held, this, is, to, distinguish, it, from, the, viola, da, gamba, meaning, viola, for, the, leg, family, in, which, all, the, members, are, all, held, with, the, legs, the, likely, predecessors, of, the, violin, family, include, the, lira, da, braccio, and, the, rebec, the, earliest, surviving, cellos, are, made, by, andrea, amati, the, first, known, member, of, the, celebrated, amati, family, of, luthiers, the, direct, ancestor, to, the, violoncello, was, the, bass, violin, monteverdi, referred, to, the, instrument, as, basso, de, viola, da, braccio, in, orfeo, 1607, although, the, first, bass, violin, possibly, invented, as, early, as, 1538, was, most, likely, inspired, by, the, viol, it, was, created, to, be, used, in, consort, with, the, violin, the, bass, violin, was, actually, often, referred, to, as, a, violone, or, large, viola, as, were, the, viols, of, the, same, period, instruments, that, share, features, with, both, the, bass, violin, and, the, viola, da, gamba, appear, in, italian, art, of, the, early, 16th, century, the, invention, of, wire, wound, strings, fine, wire, around, a, thin, gut, core, c, 1660, in, bologna, allowed, for, a, finer, bass, sound, than, was, possible, with, purely, gut, strings, on, such, a, short, body, this, instrument, had, disadvantages, as, well, however, the, cello, s, light, sound, was, not, as, suitable, for, church, and, ensemble, playing, so, it, had, to, be, doubled, by, organ, theorbo, or, violone, around, 1700, italian, players, popularized, the, cello, in, northern, europe, although, the, bass, violin, basse, de, violon, continued, to, be, used, for, another, two, decades, in, france, many, existing, bass, violins, were, literally, cut, down, in, size, to, convert, them, into, cellos, according, to, the, smaller, pattern, developed, by, stradivarius, who, also, made, a, number, of, old, pattern, large, cellos, the, servais, the, sizes, names, and, tunings, of, the, cello, varied, widely, by, geography, and, time, the, size, was, not, standardized, until, c, 1750, despite, similarities, to, the, viola, da, gamba, the, cello, is, actually, part, of, the, viola, da, braccio, family, meaning, viol, of, the, arm, which, includes, among, others, the, violin, and, viola, though, paintings, like, bruegel, s, the, rustic, wedding, and, jambe, de, fer, in, his, epitome, musical, suggest, that, the, bass, violin, had, alternate, playing, positions, these, were, short, lived, and, the, more, practical, and, ergonomic, a, gamba, position, eventually, replaced, them, entirely, baroque, era, cellos, differed, from, the, modern, instrument, in, several, ways, the, neck, has, a, different, form, and, angle, which, matches, the, baroque, bass, bar, and, stringing, the, fingerboard, is, usually, shorter, than, that, of, the, modern, cello, as, the, highest, notes, are, not, often, called, for, in, baroque, music, modern, cellos, have, an, endpin, at, the, bottom, to, support, the, instrument, and, transmit, some, of, the, sound, through, the, floor, while, baroque, cellos, are, held, only, by, the, calves, of, the, player, modern, bows, curve, in, and, are, held, at, the, frog, baroque, bows, curve, out, and, are, held, closer, to, the, bow, s, point, of, balance, modern, strings, are, normally, flatwound, with, a, metal, or, synthetic, core, baroque, strings, are, made, of, gut, with, the, g, and, c, strings, wire, wound, modern, cellos, often, have, fine, tuners, connecting, the, strings, to, the, tailpiece, which, makes, it, much, easier, to, tune, the, instrument, but, such, pins, are, rendered, ineffective, by, the, flexibility, of, the, gut, strings, used, on, baroque, cellos, overall, the, modern, instrument, has, much, higher, string, tension, than, the, baroque, cello, resulting, in, a, louder, more, projecting, tone, with, fewer, overtones, in, addition, the, instrument, was, less, standardized, in, size, and, number, of, strings, a, smaller, five, string, variant, the, violoncello, piccolo, was, commonly, used, as, a, solo, instrument, and, five, string, instruments, are, occasionally, specified, in, the, baroque, repertoire, bwv, 1012, bach, s, 6th, cello, suite, was, written, for, 5, string, cello, but, since, its, additional, high, e, string, is, an, octave, below, the, same, string, on, the, violin, anything, written, for, the, violin, can, be, played, on, the, 5, string, cello, sounding, an, octave, lower, than, written, few, educational, works, specifically, devoted, to, the, cello, existed, before, the, 18th, century, and, those, that, do, exist, contain, little, value, to, the, performer, beyond, simple, accounts, of, instrumental, technique, one, of, the, earliest, cello, manuals, is, michel, corrette, s, m, thode, th, orique, et, pratique, pour, apprendre, en, peu, de, temps, le, violoncelle, dans, sa, perfection, paris, 1741, cellos, are, part, of, the, standard, symphony, orchestra, which, usually, includes, eight, to, twelve, cellists, the, cello, section, in, standard, orchestral, seating, is, located, on, stage, left, the, audience, s, right, in, the, front, opposite, the, first, violin, section, however, some, orchestras, and, conductors, prefer, switching, the, positioning, of, the, viola, and, cello, sections, the, principal, cellist, is, the, section, leader, determining, bowings, for, the, section, in, conjunction, with, other, string, principals, playing, solos, and, leading, entrances, when, the, section, begins, to, play, its, part, principal, players, always, sit, closest, to, the, audience, the, cellos, are, a, critical, part, of, orchestral, music, all, symphonic, works, involve, the, cello, section, and, many, pieces, require, cello, soli, or, solos, much, of, the, time, cellos, provide, part, of, the, low, register, harmony, for, the, orchestra, often, the, cello, section, plays, the, melody, for, a, brief, period, before, returning, to, the, harmony, role, there, are, also, cello, concertos, which, are, orchestral, pieces, that, feature, a, solo, cellist, accompanied, by, an, entire, orchestra, there, are, numerous, cello, concertos, where, a, solo, cello, is, accompanied, by, an,

and, elgar, there, were, also, some, composers, who, while, not, otherwise, cellists, did, write, cello, specific, repertoire, such, as, nikolaus, kraft, who, wrote, six, cello, concertos, beethoven, s, triple, concerto, for, cello, violin, and, piano, and, brahms, double, concerto, for, cello, and, violin, are, also, part, of, the, concertante, repertoire, although, in, both, cases, the, cello, shares, solo, duties, with, at, least, one, other, instrument, moreover, several, composers, wrote, large, scale, pieces, for, cello, and, orchestra, which, are, concertos, in, all, but, name, some, familiar, concertos, are, richard, strauss, tone, poem, don, quixote, tchaikovsky, s, variations, on, a, rococo, theme, bloch, s, schelomo, and, bruch, s, kol, nidrei, in, the, 20th, century, the, cello, repertoire, grew, immensely, this, was, partly, due, to, the, influence, of, virtuoso, cellist, mstislav, rostropovich, who, inspired, commissioned, and, premiered, dozens, of, new, works, among, these, prokofiev, s, symphony, concerto, britten, s, cello, symphony, the, concertos, of, shostakovich, and, lutos, awski, as, well, as, dutilleux, s, tout, un, monde, lointain, have, already,

ensembles, including, solo, cellos, to, a, prominent, extent, in, indian, classical, music, saskia, rao, de, haas, is, a, well, established, soloist, as, well, as, playing, duets, with, her, sitarist, husband, pt, shubhendra, rao, other, cellists, performing, indian, classical, music, are, nancy, lesh, dhrupad, and, anup, biswas, both, rao, and, lesh, play, the, cello, sitting, cross, legged, on, the, floor, the, cello, can, also, be, used, in, bluegrass, and, folk, music, with, notable, players, including, ben, sollee, of, the, sparrow, quartet, and, the, cajun, cellist, sean, grissom, as, well, as, vyvienne, long, who, in, addition, to, her, own, projects, has, played, for, those, of, damien, rice, cellists, such, as, natalie, haas, abby, newton, and, liz, davis, maxfield, have, contributed, significantly, to, the, use, of, cello, playing, in, celtic, folk, music, often, with, the, cello, featured, as, a, primary, melodic, instrument, and, employing, the, skills, and, techniques, of, traditional, fiddle, playing, lindsay, mac, is, becoming, well, known, for, playing, the, cello, like, a, guitar, with, her, cover, of, the, beatles, blackbird, the, cello, is, typically, made, from, carved, wood, although, other, materials, such, as, carbon, fiber, or, aluminum, may, be, used, a, traditional, cello, has, a, spruce, top, with, maple, for, the, back, sides, and, neck, other, woods, such, as, poplar, or, willow, are, sometimes, used, for, the, back, and, sides, less, expensive, cellos, frequently, have, tops, and, backs, made, of, laminated, wood, laminated, cellos, are, widely, used, in, elementary, and, secondary, school, orchestras, and, youth, orchestras, because, they, are, much, more, durable, than, carved, wood, cellos, i, e, they, are, less, likely, to, crack, if, bumped, or, dropped, and, they, are, much, less, expensive, the, top, and, back, are, traditionally, hand, carved, though, less, expensive, cellos, are, often, machine, produced, the, sides, or, ribs, are, made, by, heating, the, wood, and, bending, it, around, forms, the, cello, body, has, a, wide, top, bout, narrow, middle, formed, by, two, c, bouts, and, wide, bottom, bout, with, the, bridge, and, f, holes, just, below, the, middle, the, top, and, back, of, the, cello, have, a, decorative, border, inlay, known, as, purfling, while, purfling, is, attractive, it, is, also, functional, if, the, instrument, is, struck, the, purfling, can, prevent, cracking, of, the, wood, a, crack, may, form, at, the, rim, of, the, instrument, but, spreads, no, further, without, purfling, cracks, can, spread, up, or, down, the, top, or, back, playing, traveling, and, the, weather, all, affect, the, cello, and, can, increase, a, crack, if, purfling, is, not, in, place, the, fingerboard, and, pegs, on, a, cello, are, generally, made, from, ebony, as, it, is, strong, and, does, not, wear, out, easily, in, the, late, 1920s, and, early, 1930s, the, aluminum, company, of, america, alcoa, as, well, as, german, luthier, g, a, pfretzschner, produced, an, unknown, number, of, aluminum, cellos, in, addition, to, aluminum, double, basses, and, violins, cello, manufacturer, luis, clark, constructs, cellos, from, carbon, fibre, carbon, fibre, instruments, are, particularly, suitable, for, outdoor, playing, because, of, the, strength, of, the, material, and, its, resistance, to, humidity, and, temperature, fluctuations, luis, clark, has, produced, over, 1000, cellos, some, of, which, are, owned, by, cellists, such, as, yo, yo, ma, and, josephine, van, lier, above, the, main, body, is, the, carved, neck, the, neck, has, a, curved, cross, section, on, its, underside, which, is, where, the, player, s, thumb, runs, along, the, neck, during, playing, the, neck, leads, to, a, pegbox, and, the, scroll, which, are, all, normally, carved, out, of, a, single, piece, of, wood, usually, maple, the, fingerboard, is, glued, to, the, neck, and, extends, over, the, body, of, the, instrument, the, fingerboard, is, given, a, curved, shape, matching, the, curve, on, the, bridge, both, the, fingerboard, and, bridge, need, to, be, curved, so, that, the, performer, can, bow, individual, strings, if, the, cello, were, to, have, a, flat, fingerboard, and, bridge, as, with, a, typical, guitar, the, performer, would, only, be, able, to, bow, the, leftmost, and, rightmost, two, strings, or, bow, all, the, strings, the, performer, would, not, be, able, to, play, the, inner, two, strings, alone, the, nut, is, a, raised, piece, of, wood, fitted, where, the, fingerboard, meets, the, pegbox, in, which, the, strings, rest, in, shallow, slots, or, grooves, to, keep, them, the, correct, distance, apart, the, pegbox, houses, four, tapered, tuning, pegs, one, for, each, string, the, pegs, are, used, to, tune, the, cello, by, either, tightening, or, loosening, the, string, the, pegs, are, called, friction, pegs, because, they, maintain, their, position, by, friction, the, scroll, is, a, traditional, ornamental, part, of, the, cello, and, a, feature, of, all, other, members, of, the, violin, family, ebony, is, usually, used, for, the, tuning, pegs, fingerboard, and, nut, but, other, hardwoods, such, as, boxwood, or, rosewood, can, be, used, black, fittings, on, low, cost, instruments, are, often, made, from, inexpensive, wood, that, has, been, blackened, or, ebonized, to, look, like, ebony, which, is, much, harder, and, more, expensive, ebonized, parts, such, as, tuning, pegs, may, crack, or, split, and, the, black, surface, of, the, fingerboard, will, eventually, wear, down, to, reveal, the, lighter, wood, underneath, historically, cello, strings, had, cores, made, out, of, catgut, which, despite, its, name, is, made, from, sheep, or, goat, intestines, most, modern, strings, used, in, the, 2010s, are, wound, with, metallic, materials, like, aluminum, titanium, and, chromium, cellists, may, mix, different, types, of, strings, on, their, instruments, the, pitches, of, the, open, strings, are, c, g, d, and, a, black, note, heads, in, the, playing, range, figure, above, unless, alternative, tuning, scordatura, is, specified, by, the, composer, some, composers, e, g, ottorino, respighi, in, the, final, movement, of, the, pines, of, rome, ask, that, the, low, c, be, tuned, down, to, a, b, flat, so, that, the, performer, can, play, a, different, low, note, on, the, lowest, open, string, the, tailpiece, and, endpin, are, found, in, the, lower, part, of, the, cello, the, tailpiece, is, the, part, of, the, cello, to, which, the, ball, ends, of, the, strings, are, attached, by, passing, them, through, holes, the, tailpiece, is, attached, to, the, bottom, of, the, cello, the, tailpiece, is, traditionally, made, of, ebony, or, another, hardwood, but, can, also, be, made, of, plastic, or, steel, on, lower, cost, instruments, it, attaches, the, strings, to, the, lower, end, of, the, cello, and, can, have, one, or, more, fine, tuners, the, fine, tuners, are, used, to, make, smaller, adjustments, to, the, pitch, of, the, string, the, fine, tuners, can, increase, the, tension, of, each, string, raising, the, pitch, or, decrease, the, tension, of, the, string, lowering, the, pitch, when, the, performer, is, putting, on, a, new, string, the, fine, tuner, for, that, string, is, normally, reset, to, a, middle, position, and, then, the, peg, is, turned, to, bring, the, string, up, to, pitch, the, fine, turners, are, used, for, subtle, minor, adjustments, to, pitch, such, as, tuning, a, cello, to, the, oboe, s, 440, hz, a, note, or, tuning, the, cello, to, a, piano, the, endpin, or, spike, is, made, of, wood, metal, or, rigid, carbon, fiber, and, supports, the, cello, in, playing, position, the, endpin, can, be, retracted, into, the, hollow, body, of, the, instrument, when, the, cello, is, being, transported, in, its, case, this, makes, the, cello, easier, to, move, about, when, the, performer, wishes, to, play, the, cello, the, endpin, is, pulled, out, to, lengthen, it, the, endpin, is, locked, into, the, player, s, preferred, length, with, a, screw, mechanism, the, adjustable, nature, of, endpins, enables, performers, of, different, ages, and, body, sizes, to, adjust, the, endpin, length, to, suit, them, in, the, baroque, period, the, cello, was, held, between, the, calves, as, there, was, no, endpin, at, that, time, the, endpin, was, introduced, by, adrien, servais, c, 1845, to, give, the, instrument, greater, stability, modern, endpins, are, retractable, and, adjustable, older, ones, were, removed, when, not, in, use, the, word, endpin, sometimes, also, refers, to, the, button, of, wood, located, at, this, place, in, all, instruments, in, the, violin, family, but, this, is, usually, called, tailpin, the, sharp, tip, of, the, cello, s, endpin, is, sometimes, capped, with, a, rubber, tip, that, protects, the, tip, from, dulling, and, prevents, the, cello, from, slipping, on, the, floor, many, cellists, use, a, rubber, pad, with, a, metal, cup, to, keep, the, tip, from, slipping, on, the, floor, a, number, of, accessories, exist, to, keep, the, endpin, from, slipping, these, include, ropes, that, attach, to, the, chair, leg, and, other, devices, the, bridge, holds, the, strings, above, the, cello, and, transfers, their, vibrations, to, the, top, of, the, instrument, and, the, soundpost, inside, see, below, the, bridge, is, not, glued, but, rather, held, in, place, by, the, tension, of, the, strings, the, bridge, is, usually, positioned, by, the, cross, point, of, the, f, hole, i, e, where, the, horizontal, line, occurs, in, the, f, the, f, holes, named, for, their, shape, are, located, on, either, side, of, the, bridge, and, allow, air, to, move, in, and, out, of, the, instrument, as, part, of, the, sound, production, process, the, f, holes, also, act, as, access, points, to, the, interior, of, the, cello, for, repairs, or, maintenance, sometimes, a, small, length, of, rubber, hose, containing, a, water, soaked, sponge, called, a, dampit, is, inserted, through, the, f, holes, and, serves, as, a, humidifier, this, keeps, the, wood, components, of, the, cello, from, drying, out, internally, the, cello, has, two, important, features, a, bass, bar, which, is, glued, to, the, underside, of, the, top, of, the, instrument, and, a, round, wooden, sound, post, a, solid, wooden, cylinder, which, is, wedged, between, the, top, and, bottom, plates, the, bass, bar, found, under, the, bass, foot, of, the, bridge, serves, to, support, the, cello, s, top, and, distribute, the, vibrations, from, the, strings, to, the, body, of, the, instrument, the, soundpost, found, under, the, treble, side, of, the, bridge, connects, the, back, and, front, of, the, cello, like, the, bridge, the, soundpost, is, not, glued, but, is, kept, in, place, by, the, tensions, of, the, bridge, and, strings, together, the, bass, bar, and, sound, post, transfer, the, strings, vibrations, to, the, top, front, of, the, instrument, and, to, a, lesser, extent, the, back, acting, as, a, diaphragm, to, produce, the, instrument, s, sound, cellos, are, constructed, and, repaired, using, hide, glue, which, is, strong, but, reversible, allowing, for, disassembly, when, needed, tops, may, be, glued, on, with, diluted, glue, since, some, repairs, call, for, the, removal, of, the, top, theoretically, hide, glue, is, weaker, than, the, body, s, wood, so, as, the, top, or, back, shrinks, side, to, side, the, glue, holding, it, lets, go, and, the, plate, does, not, crack, cellists, repairing, cracks, in, their, cello, do, not, use, regular, wood, glue, because, it, cannot, be, steamed, open, when, a, repair, has, to, be, made, by, a, luthier, traditionally, bows, are, made, from, pernambuco, or, brazilwood, both, come, from, the, same, species, of, tree, caesalpinia, echinata, but, pernambuco, used, for, higher, quality, bows, is, the, heartwood, of, the, tree, and, is, darker, in, color, than, brazilwood, which, is, sometimes, stained, to, compensate, pernambuco, is, a, heavy, resinous, wood, with, great, elasticity, which, makes, it, an, ideal, wood, for, instrument, bows, horsehair, is, stretched, out, between, the, two, ends, of, the, bow, the, taut, horsehair, is, drawn, over, the, strings, while, being, held, roughly, parallel, to, the, bridge, and, perpendicular, to, the, strings, to, produce, sound, a, small, knob, is, twisted, to, increase, or, decrease, the, tension, of, the, horsehair, the, tension, on, the, bow, is, released, when, the, instrument, is, not, being, used, the, amount, of, tension, a, cellist, puts, on, the, bow, hair, depends, on, the, preferences, of, the, player, the, style, of, music, being, played, and, for, students, the, preferences, of, their, teacher, bows, are, also, made, from, other, materials, such, as, carbon, fibre, stronger, than, wood, and, fiberglass, often, used, to, make, inexpensive, lower, quality, student, bows, an, average, cello, bow, is, 73, cm, 29, in, long, shorter, than, a, violin, or, viola, bow, 3, cm, 1, 2, in, high, from, the, frog, to, the, stick, and, 1, 5, cm, 0, 59, in, wide, the, frog, of, a, cello, bow, typically, has, a, rounded, corner, like, that, of, a, viola, bow, but, is, wider, a, cello, bow, is, roughly, 10, g, 0, 35, oz, heavier, than, a, viola, bow, which, in, turn, is, roughly, 10, g, 0, 35, oz, heavier, than, a, violin, bow, bow, hair, is, traditionally, horsehair, though, synthetic, hair, in, varying, colors, is, also, used, prior, to, playing, the, musician, tightens, the, bow, by, turning, a, screw, to, pull, the, frog, the, part, of, the, bow, under, the, hand, back, and, increase, the, tension, of, the, hair, rosin, is, applied, by, the, player, to, make, the, hair, sticky, bows, need, to, be, re, haired, periodically, baroque, style, 1600, 1750, cello, bows, were, much, thicker, and, were, formed, with, a, larger, outward, arch, than, modern, cello, bows, the, inward, arch, of, a, modern, cello, bow, produces, greater, tension, which, in, turn, produces, a, louder, sound, the, cello, bow, has, also, been, used, to, play, electric, guitars, jimmy, page, pioneered, its, application, on, tracks, such, as, dazed, and, confused, the, post, rock, icelandic, band, sigur, r, s, s, lead, singer, often, plays, guitar, using, a, cello, bow, in, 1989, the, german, cellist, michael, bach, began, developing, a, curved, bow, encouraged, by, john, cage, dieter, schnebel, mstislav, rostropovich, and, luigi, colani, and, since, then, many, pieces, have, been, composed, especially, for, it, this, curved, bow, bach, bow, is, a, convex, curved, bow, which, unlike, the, ordinary, bow, renders, possible, polyphonic, playing, on, the, various, strings, of, the, instrument, the, solo, repertoire, for, violin, and, cello, by, j, s, bach, the, bach, bow, is, particularly, suited, to, it, and, it, was, developed, with, this, in, mind, polyphonic, playing, being, required, as, well, as, monophonic, when, a, string, is, bowed, or, plucked, it, vibrates, and, moves, the, air, around, it, producing, sound, waves, because, the, string, is, quite, thin, not, much, air, is, moved, by, the, string, itself, and, consequently, if, the, string, was, not, mounted, on, a, hollow, body, the, sound, would, be, weak, in, acoustic, stringed, instruments, such, as, the, cello, this, lack, of, volume, is, solved, by, mounting, the, vibrating, string, on, a, larger, hollow, wooden, body, the, vibrations, are, transmitted, to, the, larger, body, which, can, move, more, air, and, produce, a, louder, sound, different, designs, of, the, instrument, produce, variations, in, the, instrument, s, vibrational, patterns, and, thus, change, the, character, of, the, sound, produced, a, string, s, fundamental, pitch, can, be, adjusted, by, changing, its, stiffness, which, depends, on, tension, and, length, tightening, a, string, stiffens, it, by, increasing, both, the, outward, forces, along, its, length, and, the, net, forces, it, experiences, during, a, distortion, a, cello, can, be, tuned, by, adjusting, the, tension, of, its, strings, by, turning, the, tuning, pegs, mounted, on, its, pegbox, and, tension, adjusters, fine, tuners, on, the, tailpiece, a, string, s, length, also, affects, its, fundamental, pitch, shortening, a, string, stiffens, it, by, increasing, its, curvature, during, a, distortion, and, subjecting, it, to, larger, net, forces, shortening, the, string, also, reduces, its, mass, but, does, not, alter, the, mass, per, unit, length, and, it, is, the, latter, ratio, rather, than, the, total, mass, which, governs, the, frequency, the, string, vibrates, in, a, standing, wave, whose, speed, of, propagation, is, given, by, t, m, displaystyle, sqrt, frac, t, m, where, t, is, the, tension, and, m, is, the, mass, per, unit, length, there, is, a, node, at, either, end, of, the, vibrating, length, and, thus, the, vibrating, length, l, is, half, a, wavelength, since, the, frequency, of, any, wave, is, equal, to, the, speed, divided, by, the, wavelength, we, have, f, r, e, q, u, e, n, c, y, 1, 2, l, t, m, displaystyle, frequency, frac, 1, 2l, cdot, sqrt, frac, t, m, some, writers, including, muncaster, cited, below, use, the, greek, letter, in, place, of, m, thus, shortening, a, string, increases, the, frequency, and, thus, the, pitch, because, of, this, effect, you, can, raise, and, change, the, pitch, of, a, string, by, pressing, it, against, the, fingerboard, in, the, cello, s, neck, and, effectively, shortening, it, likewise, strings, with, less, mass, per, unit, length, if, under, the, same, tension, will, have, a, higher, frequency, and, thus, higher, pitch, than, more, massive, strings, this, is, a, prime, reason, the, different, strings, on, all, string, instruments, have, different, fundamental, pitches, with, the, lightest, strings, having, the, highest, pitches, a, played, note, of, e, or, f, sharp, has, a, frequency, that, is, often, very, close, to, the, natural, resonating, frequency, of, the, body, of, the, instrument, and, if, the, problem, is, not, addressed, this, can, set, the, body, into, near, resonance, this, may, cause, an, unpleasant, sudden, amplification, of, this, pitch, and, additionally, a, loud, beating, sound, results, from, the, interference, produced, between, these, nearby, frequencies, this, is, known, as, the, wolf, tone, because, it, is, an, unpleasant, growling, sound, the, wood, resonance, appears, to, be, split, into, two, frequencies, by, the, driving, force, of, the, sounding, string, these, two, periodic, resonances, beat, with, each, other, this, wolf, tone, must, be, eliminated, or, significantly, reduced, for, the, cello, to, play, the, nearby, notes, with, a, pleasant, tone, this, can, be, accomplished, by, modifying, the, cello, front, plate, attaching, a, wolf, eliminator, a, metal, cylinder, or, a, rubber, cylinder, encased, in, metal, or, moving, the, soundpost, when, a, string, is, bowed, or, plucked, to, produce, a, note, the, fundamental, note, is, accompanied, by, higher, frequency, overtones, each, sound, has, a, particular, recipe, of, frequencies, that, combine, to, make, the, total, sound, playing, the, cello, is, done, while, seated, with, the, instrument, supported, on, the, floor, by, the, endpin, the, right, hand, bows, or, sometimes, plucks, the, strings, to, sound, the, notes, the, left, hand, fingertips, stop, the, strings, along, their, length, determining, the, pitch, of, each, fingered, note, stopping, the, string, closer, to, the, bridge, results, in, a, higher, pitched, sound, because, the, vibrating, string, length, has, been, shortened, on, the, contrary, a, string, stopped, closer, to, the, tuning, pegs, produces, a, lower, sound, in, the, neck, positions, which, use, just, less, than, half, of, the, fingerboard, nearest, the, top, of, the, instrument, the, thumb, rests, on, the, back, of, the, neck, some, people, use, their, thumb, as, a, marker, of, their, position, in, thumb, position, a, general, name, for, notes, on, the, remainder, of, the, fingerboard, the, thumb, usually, rests, alongside, the, fingers, on, the, string, then, the, side, of, the, thumb, is, used, to, play, notes, the, fingers, are, normally, held, curved, with, each, knuckle, bent, with, the, fingertips, in, contact, with, the, string, if, a, finger, is, required, on, two, or, more, strings, at, once, to, play, perfect, fifths, in, double, stops, or, chords, it, is, used, flat, the, contact, point, can, move, slightly, away, from, the, nail, to, the, finger, s, pad, in, slower, or, more, expressive, playing, allowing, a, fuller, vibrato, vibrato, is, a, small, oscillation, in, the, pitch, of, a, note, usually, considered, an, expressive, technique, the, closer, towards, the, bridge, the, note, is, the, smaller, the, oscillation, needed, to, create, the, effect, harmonics, played, on, the, cello, fall, into, two, classes, natural, and, artificial, natural, harmonics, are, produced, by, lightly, touching, but, not, depressing, the, string, at, certain, places, and, then, bowing, or, rarely, plucking, the, string, for, example, the, halfway, point, of, the, string, will, produce, a, harmonic, that, is, one, octave, above, the, unfingered, open, string, natural, harmonics, only, produce, notes, that, are, part, of, the, harmonic, series, on, a, particular, string, artificial, harmonics, also, called, false, harmonics, or, stopped, harmonics, in, which, the, player, depresses, the, string, fully, with, one, finger, while, touching, the, same, string, lightly, with, another, finger, can, produce, any, note, above, middle, c, glissando, italian, for, sliding, is, an, effect, achieved, by, sliding, the, finger, up, or, down, the, fingerboard, without, releasing, the, string, this, causes, the, pitch, to, rise, and, fall, smoothly, without, separate, discernible, steps, in, cello, playing, the, bow, is, much, like, the, breath, of, a, wind, instrument, player, arguably, it, is, a, major, factor, in, the, expressiveness, of, the, playing, the, right, hand, holds, the, bow, and, controls, the, duration, and, character, of, the, notes, in, general, the, bow, is, drawn, across, the, strings, roughly, halfway, between, the, end, of, the, fingerboard, and, the, bridge, in, a, direction, perpendicular, to, the, strings, however, the, player, may, wish, to, move, the, bow, s, point, of, contact, higher, or, lower, depending, on, the, desired, sound, the, bow, is, held, and, manipulated, with, all, five, fingers, of, the, right, hand, with, the, thumb, opposite, the, fingers, and, closer, to, the, cellist, s, body, tone, production, and, volume, of, sound, depend, on, a, combination, of, several, factors, the, four, most, important, ones, are, weight, applied, to, the, string, the, angle, of, the, bow, on, the, string, bow, speed, and, the, point, of, contact, of, the, bow, hair, with, the, string, sometimes, abbreviated, wasp, double, stops, involve, the, playing, of, two, notes, simultaneously, two, strings, are, fingered, at, once, and, the, bow, is, drawn, to, sound, them, both, often, in, pizzicato, playing, the, string, is, plucked, directly, with, the, fingers, or, thumb, of, the, right, hand, however, the, strings, may, be, plucked, with, a, finger, of, the, left, hand, in, certain, advanced, pieces, either, so, that, the, cellist, can, play, bowed, notes, on, another, string, along, with, pizzicato, notes, or, because, the, speed, of, the, piece, would, not, allow, the, player, sufficient, time, to, pluck, with, the, right, hand, in, musical, notation, pizzicato, is, often, abbreviated, as, pizz, the, position, of, the, hand, in, pizzicato, is, commonly, slightly, over, the, fingerboard, and, away, from, the, bridge, a, player, using, the, col, legno, technique, strikes, or, rubs, the, strings, with, the, wood, of, the, bow, rather, than, the, hair, in, spiccato, playing, the, bow, still, moves, in, a, horizontal, motion, on, the, string, but, is, allowed, to, bounce, generating, a, lighter, somewhat, more, percussive, sound, in, staccato, the,
