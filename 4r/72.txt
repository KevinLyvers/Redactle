promoting, the, return, of, cultural, property, to, its, countries, of, origin, the, museum, consequently, returned, in, 2009, five, egyptian, fragments, of, frescoes, 30, cm, x, 15, cm, each, whose, existence, of, the, tomb, of, origin, had, only, been, brought, to, the, authorities, attention, in, 2008, eight, to, five, years, after, their, good, faith, acquisition, by, the, museum, from, two, private, collections, and, after, the, necessary, respect, of, the, procedure, of, d, classement, from, french, public, collections, before, the, commission, scientifique, nationale, des, collections,

national, museums, of, recovered, artwork, some, 10, to, 35, of, the, pieces, are, believed, to, come, from, jewish, spoliations, and, until, the, identification, of, their, rightful, owners, which, declined, at, the, end, of, the, 1960s, they, are, registered, indefinitely, on, separate, inventories, from, the, museum, s, collections, they, were, exhibited, in, 1946, and, shown, all, together, to, the, public, during, four, years, 1950, 1954, in, order, to, allow, rightful, claimants, to, identify, their, properties, then, stored, or, displayed, according, to, their, interest, in, several, french, museums, including, the, louvre, from, 1951, to, 1965, about, 37, pieces, were, restituted, since, november, 1996, the, partly, illustrated, catalogue, of, 1947, 1949, has, been, accessible,

allowed, more, accurate, investigations, since, 1996, the, restitutions, according, sometimes, to, less, formal, criteria, concerned, 47, more, pieces, 26, paintings, with, 6, from, the, louvre, including, a, then, displayed, tiepolo, until, the, last, claims, of, french, owners, and, their, heirs, ended, again, in, 2006, according, to, serge, klarsfeld, since, the, now, complete, and, constant, publicity, which, the, artworks, got, in, 1996, the, majority, of, the, french, jewish, community, is, nevertheless, in, favour, of, the, return, to, the, normal, french, civil, rule, of, prescription, acquisitive, of, any, unclaimed, good, after, another, long, period, of, time, and, consequently, to, their, ultimate, integration, into, the, common, french, heritage, instead, of,
