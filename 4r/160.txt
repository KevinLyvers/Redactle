their, prophecies, to, him, to, answer, his, questions, they, summon, horrible, apparitions, each, of, which, offers, predictions, and, further, prophecies, to, put, macbeth, s, fears, at, rest,

scotland, who, was, later, james, i, of, england, was, supposedly, a, descendant, of, banquo, a, principal, source, comes, from, the, daemonologie, of, king, james, published, in, 1597, which, included, a, news, pamphlet, titled, newes, from, scotland, that, detailed, the, famous, north, berwick, witch, trials, of, 1590, the, publication, of, daemonologie, came, just, a, few, years, before, the, tragedy, of, macbeth, with, the, themes, and, setting, in, a, direct, and, comparative, contrast, with, king, james, personal, obsessions, with, witchcraft, which, developed, following, his, conclusion, that, the, stormy, weather, that, threatened, his, passage, from, denmark, to, scotland, was, a, targeted, attack, not, only, did, the, subsequent, trials, take, place, in, scotland, the, women, accused, were, recorded, under, torture, of, having, conducted, rituals, with, the, same, mannerisms, as, the, three, witches, one, of, the, evidenced, passages, is, referenced, when, the, women, under, trial, confessed, to, attempt, the, use, of, witchcraft, to, raise, a, tempest, and, sabotage, the, boat, king, james, and, his, queen, were, on, board, during, their, return, trip, from, denmark, the, three, witches, discuss, the, raising, of, winds, at, sea, in, the, opening, lines, of, act, 1, scene, 3, macbeth, has, been, compared, to, shakespeare, s, antony, and, cleopatra, as, characters, both, antony, and, macbeth, seek, a, new, world, even, at, the, cost, of, the, old, one, both, fight, for, a, throne, and, have, a, nemesis, to, face, to, achieve, that, throne, for, antony, the, nemesis, is, octavius, for, macbeth, it, is, banquo, at, one, point, macbeth, even, compares, himself, to, antony, saying, under, banquo, my, genius, is, rebuk, d, as, it, is, said, mark, antony, s, was, by, caesar, lastly, both, plays, contain, powerful, and, manipulative, female, figures, cleopatra, and, lady, macbeth, shakespeare, borrowed, the, story, from, several, tales, in, holinshed, s, chronicles, a, popular, history, of, the, british, isles, well, known, to, shakespeare, and, his, contemporaries, in, chronicles, a, man, named, donwald, finds, several, of, his, family, put, to, death, by, his, king, duff, for, dealing, with, witches, after, being, pressured, by, his, wife, he, and, four, of, his, servants, kill, the, king, in, his, own, house, in, chronicles, macbeth, is, portrayed, as, struggling, to, support, the, kingdom, in, the, face, of, king, duncan, s, ineptitude, he, and, banquo, meet, the, three, witches, who, make, exactly, the, same, prophecies, as, in, shakespeare, s, version, macbeth, and, banquo, then, together, plot, the, murder, of, duncan, at, lady, macbeth, s, urging, macbeth, has, a, long, ten, year, reign, before, eventually, being, overthrown, by, macduff, and, malcolm, the, parallels, between, the, two, versions, are, clear, however, some, scholars, think, that, george, buchanan, s, rerum, scoticarum, historia, matches, shakespeare, s, version, more, closely, buchanan, s, work, was, available, in, latin, in, shakespeare, s, day, no, medieval, account, of, the, reign, of, macbeth, mentions, the, weird, sisters, banquo, or, lady, macbeth, and, with, the, exception, of, the, latter, none, actually, existed, the, characters, of, banquo, the, weird, sisters, and, lady, macbeth, were, first, mentioned, in, 1527, by, a, scottish, historian, hector, boece, in, his, book, historia, gentis, scotorum, history, of, the, scottish, people, who, wanted, to, denigrate, macbeth, in, order, to, strengthen, the, claim, of, the, house, of, stewart, to, the, scottish, throne, boece, portrayed, banquo, as, an, ancestor, of, the, stewart, kings, of, scotland, adding, in, a, prophecy, that, the, descendants, of, banquo, would, be, the, rightful, kings, of, scotland, while, the, weird, sisters, served, to, give, a, picture, of, king, macbeth, as, gaining, the, throne, via, dark, supernatural, forces, macbeth, did, have, a, wife, but, it, is, not, clear, if, she, was, as, power, hungry, and, ambitious, as, boece, portrayed, her, which, served, his, purpose, of, having, even, macbeth, realise, he, lacked, a, proper, claim, to, the, throne, and, only, took, it, at, the, urging, of, his, wife, holinshed, accepted, boece, s, version, of, macbeth, s, reign, at, face, value, and, included, it, in, his, chronicles, shakespeare, saw, the, dramatic, possibilities, in, the, story, as, related, by, holinshed, and, used, it, as, the, basis, for, the, play, no, other, version, of, the, story, has, macbeth, kill, the, king, in, macbeth, s, own, castle, scholars, have, seen, this, change, of, shakespeare, s, as, adding, to, the, darkness, of, macbeth, s, crime, as, the, worst, violation, of, hospitality, versions, of, the, story, that, were, common, at, the, time, had, duncan, being, killed, in, an, ambush, at, inverness, not, in, a, castle, shakespeare, conflated, the, story, of, donwald, and, king, duff, in, what, was, a, significant, change, to, the, story, shakespeare, made, another, important, change, in, chronicles, banquo, is, an, accomplice, in, macbeth, s, murder, of, king, duncan, and, plays, an, important, part, in, ensuring, that, macbeth, not, malcolm, takes, the, throne, in, the, coup, that, follows, in, shakespeare, s, day, banquo, was, thought, to, be, an, ancestor, of, the, stuart, king, james, i, in, the, 19th, century, it, was, established, that, banquo, is, an, unhistorical, character, the, stuarts, are, actually, descended, from, a, breton, family, which, migrated, to, scotland, slightly, later, than, macbeth, s, time, the, banquo, portrayed, in, earlier, sources, is, significantly, different, from, the, banquo, created, by, shakespeare, critics, have, proposed, several, reasons, for, this, change, first, to, portray, the, king, s, ancestor, as, a, murderer, would, have, been, risky, other, authors, of, the, time, who, wrote, about, banquo, such, as, jean, de, schelandre, in, his, stuartide, also, changed, history, by, portraying, banquo, as, a, noble, man, not, a, murderer, probably, for, the, same, reasons, second, shakespeare, may, have, altered, banquo, s, character, simply, because, there, was, no, dramatic, need, for, another, accomplice, to, the, murder, there, was, however, a, need, to, give, a, dramatic, contrast, to, macbeth, a, role, which, many, scholars, argue, is, filled, by, banquo, other, scholars, maintain, that, a, strong, argument, can, be, made, for, associating, the, tragedy, with, the, gunpowder, plot, of, 1605, as, presented, by, harold, bloom, in, 2008, cholars, cite, the, existence, of, several, topical, references, in, macbeth, to, the, events, of, that, year, namely, the, execution, of, the, father, henry, garnet, for, his, alleged, complicity, in, the, gunpowder, plot, of, 1605, as, referenced, in, the, porter, s, scene, those, arrested, for, their, role, in, the, gunpowder, plot, refused, to, give, direct, answers, to, the, questions, posed, to, them, by, their, interrogators, which, reflected, the, influence, of, the, jesuit, practice, of, equivocation, shakespeare, by, having, macbeth, say, that, demons, palter, in, a, double, sense, and, keep, the, promise, to, our, ear, and, break, it, to, our, hope, confirmed, james, s, belief, that, equivocation, was, a, wicked, practice, which, reflected, in, turn, the, wickedness, of, the, catholic, church, garnet, had, in, his, possession, a, treatise, on, equivocation, and, in, the, play, the, weird, sisters, often, engage, in, equivocation, for, instance, telling, macbeth, that, he, could, never, be, overthrown, until, great, birnan, wood, to, high, dunsinane, hill, shall, come, macbeth, interprets, the, prophecy, as, meaning, never, but, in, fact, the, three, sisters, refer, only, to, branches, of, the, trees, of, great, birnam, coming, to, dunsinane, hill, the, inspiration, for, this, prophecy, may, have, originated, with, the, battle, of, droizy, both, that, battle, and, macbeth, may, have, in, turn, inspired, j, r, r, tolkien, s, tree, herders, the, ents, in, his, novels, the, lord, of, the, rings, macbeth, cannot, be, dated, precisely, but, it, is, usually, taken, to, be, contemporaneous, to, the, other, canonical, tragedies, hamlet, othello, and, king, lear, while, some, scholars, have, placed, the, original, writing, of, the, play, as, early, as, 1599, most, believe, that, the, play, is, unlikely, to, have, been, composed, earlier, than, 1603, as, the, play, is, widely, seen, to, celebrate, king, james, ancestors, and, the, stuart, accession, to, the, throne, in, 1603, james, believed, himself, to, be, descended, from, banquo, suggesting, that, the, parade, of, eight, kings, which, the, witches, show, macbeth, in, a, vision, in, act, iv, is, a, compliment, to, king, james, many, scholars, think, the, play, was, written, in, 1606, in, the, aftermath, of, the, gunpowder, plot, citing, possible, internal, allusions, to, the, 1605, plot, and, its, ensuing, trials, in, fact, there, are, a, great, number, of, allusions, and, possible, pieces, of, evidence, alluding, to, the, plot, and, for, this, reason, a, great, many, critics, agree, that, macbeth, was, written, in, the, year, 1606, lady, macbeth, s, instructions, to, her, husband, look, like, the, innocent, flower, but, be, the, serpent, under, t, 1, 5, 74, 75, may, be, an, allusion, to, a, medal, that, was, struck, in, 1605, to, commemorate, king, james, escape, that, depicted, a, serpent, hiding, among, lilies, and, roses, particularly, the, porter, s, speech, 2, 3, 1, 21, in, which, he, welcomes, an, equivocator, a, farmer, and, a, tailor, to, hell, 2, 3, 8, 13, has, been, argued, to, be, an, allusion, to, the, 28, march, 1606, trial, and, execution, on, 3, may, 1606, of, the, jesuit, henry, garnet, who, used, the, alias, farmer, with, equivocator, referring, to, garnet, s, defence, of, equivocation, the, porter, says, that, the, equivocator, committed, treason, enough, for, god, s, sake, 2, 3, 9, 10, which, specifically, connects, equivocation, and, treason, and, ties, it, to, the, jesuit, belief, that, equivocation, was, only, lawful, when, used, for, god, s, sake, strengthening, the, allusion, to, garnet, the, porter, goes, on, to, say, that, the, equivocator, yet, could, not, equivocate, to, heaven, 2, 3, 10, 11, echoing, grim, jokes, that, were, current, on, the, eve, of, garnet, s, execution, i, e, that, garnet, would, be, hanged, without, equivocation, and, at, his, execution, he, was, asked, not, to, equivocate, with, his, last, breath, the, english, tailor, the, porter, admits, to, hell, 2, 3, 13, has, been, seen, as, an, allusion, to, hugh, griffin, a, tailor, who, was, questioned, by, the, archbishop, of, canterbury, on, 27, november, and, 3, december, 1607, for, the, part, he, played, in, garnet, s, miraculous, straw, an, infamous, head, of, straw, that, was, stained, with, garnet, s, blood, that, had, congealed, into, a, form, resembling, garnet, s, portrait, which, was, hailed, by, catholics, as, a, miracle, the, tailor, griffin, became, notorious, and, the, subject, of, verses, published, with, his, portrait, on, the, title, page, when, james, became, king, of, england, a, feeling, of, uncertainty, settled, over, the, nation, james, was, a, scottish, king, and, the, son, of, mary, queen, of, scots, a, staunch, catholic, and, english, traitor, in, the, words, of, critic, robert, crawford, macbeth, was, a, play, for, a, post, elizabethan, england, facing, up, to, what, it, might, mean, to, have, a, scottish, king, england, seems, comparatively, benign, while, its, northern, neighbour, is, mired, in, a, bloody, monarch, killing, past, macbeth, may, have, been, set, in, medieval, scotland, but, it, was, filled, with, material, of, interest, to, england, and, england, s, ruler, critics, argue, that, the, content, of, the, play, is, clearly, a, message, to, james, the, new, scottish, king, of, england, likewise, the, critic, andrew, hadfield, noted, the, contrast, the, play, draws, between, the, saintly, king, edward, the, confessor, of, england, who, has, the, power, of, the, royal, touch, to, cure, scrofula, and, whose, realm, is, portrayed, as, peaceful, and, prosperous, vs, the, bloody, chaos, of, scotland, james, in, his, 1598, book, the, trew, law, of, free, monarchies, had, asserted, that, kings, are, always, right, if, not, just, and, his, subjects, owe, him, total, loyalty, at, all, times, writing, that, even, if, a, king, is, a, tyrant, his, subjects, must, never, rebel, and, just, endure, his, tyranny, for, their, own, good, james, had, argued, that, the, tyranny, was, preferable, to, the, problems, caused, by, rebellion, which, were, even, worse, shakespeare, by, contrast, in, macbeth, argued, for, the, right, of, the, subjects, to, overthrow, a, tyrant, king, in, what, appeared, to, be, an, implied, criticism, of, james, s, theories, if, applied, to, england, hadfield, also, noted, a, curious, aspect, of, the, play, in, that, it, implies, that, primogeniture, is, the, norm, in, scotland, but, duncan, has, to, nominate, his, son, malcolm, to, be, his, successor, while, macbeth, is, accepted, without, protest, by, the, scottish, lairds, as, their, king, despite, being, an, usurper, hadfield, argued, this, aspect, of, the, play, with, the, thanes, apparently, choosing, their, king, was, a, reference, to, the, stuart, claim, to, the, english, throne, and, the, attempts, of, the, english, parliament, to, block, the, succession, of, james, s, catholic, mother, mary, queen, of, scots, from, succeeding, to, the, english, throne, hadfield, argued, that, shakespeare, implied, that, james, was, indeed, the, rightful, king, of, england, but, owed, his, throne, not, to, divine, favour, as, james, would, have, it, but, rather, due, to, the, willingness, of, the, english, parliament, to, accept, the, protestant, son, of, the, catholic, mary, queen, of, scots, as, their, king, garry, wills, provides, further, evidence, that, macbeth, is, a, gunpowder, play, a, type, of, play, that, emerged, immediately, following, the, events, of, the, gunpowder, plot, he, points, out, that, every, gunpowder, play, contains, a, necromancy, scene, regicide, attempted, or, completed, references, to, equivocation, scenes, that, test, loyalty, by, use, of, deceptive, language, and, a, character, who, sees, through, plots, along, with, a, vocabulary, similar, to, the, plot, in, its, immediate, aftermath, words, like, train, blow, vault, and, an, ironic, recoil, of, the, plot, upon, the, plotters, who, fall, into, the, pit, they, dug, the, play, utilizes, a, few, key, words, that, the, audience, at, the, time, would, recognize, as, allusions, to, the, plot, in, one, sermon, in, 1605, lancelot, andrewes, stated, regarding, the, failure, of, the, plotters, on, god, s, day, be, they, fair, or, foul, glad, or, sad, as, the, poet, calleth, him, the, great, diespiter, the, father, of, days, hath, made, them, both, shakespeare, begins, the, play, by, using, the, words, fair, and, foul, in, the, first, speeches, of, the, witches, and, macbeth, in, the, words, of, jonathan, gil, harris, the, play, expresses, the, horror, unleashed, by, a, supposedly, loyal, subject, who, seeks, to, kill, a, king, and, the, treasonous, role, of, equivocation, the, play, even, echoes, certain, keywords, from, the, scandal, the, vault, beneath, the, house, of, parliament, in, which, guy, fawkes, stored, thirty, kegs, of, gunpowder, and, the, blow, about, which, one, of, the, conspirators, had, secretly, warned, a, relative, who, planned, to, attend, the, house, of, parliament, on, 5, november, even, though, the, plot, is, never, alluded, to, directly, its, presence, is, everywhere, in, the, play, like, a, pervasive, odor, scholars, also, cite, an, entertainment, seen, by, king, james, at, oxford, in, the, summer, of, 1605, that, featured, three, sibyls, like, the, weird, sisters, kermode, surmises, that, shakespeare, could, have, heard, about, this, and, alluded, to, it, with, the, weird, sisters, however, a, r, braunmuller, in, the, new, cambridge, edition, finds, the, 1605, 06, arguments, inconclusive, and, argues, only, for, an, earliest, date, of, 1603, one, suggested, allusion, supporting, a, date, in, late, 1606, is, the, first, witch, s, dialogue, about, a, sailor, s, wife, aroint, thee, witch, the, rump, fed, ronyon, cries, her, husband, s, to, aleppo, gone, master, o, the, tiger, 1, 3, 6, 7, this, has, been, thought, to, allude, to, the, tiger, a, ship, that, returned, to, england, 27, june, 1606, after, a, disastrous, voyage, in, which, many, of, the, crew, were, killed, by, pirates, a, few, lines, later, the, witch, speaks, of, the, sailor, he, shall, live, a, man, forbid, weary, se, nnights, nine, times, nine, 1, 3, 21, 22, the, real, ship, was, at, sea, 567, days, the, product, of, 7x9x9, which, has, been, taken, as, a, confirmation, of, the, allusion, which, if, correct, confirms, that, the, witch, scenes, were, either, written, or, amended, later, than, july, 1606, the, play, is, not, considered, to, have, been, written, any, later, than, 1607, since, as, kermode, notes, there, are, fairly, clear, allusions, to, the, play, in, 1607, one, notable, reference, is, in, francis, beaumont, s, knight, of, the, burning, pestle, first, performed, in, 1607, the, following, lines, act, v, scene, 1, 24, 30, are, according, to, scholars, a, clear, allusion, to, the, scene, in, which, banquo, s, ghost, haunts, macbeth, at, the, dinner, table, when, thou, art, at, thy, table, with, thy, friends, merry, in, heart, and, filled, with, swelling, wine, i, ll, come, in, midst, of, all, thy, pride, and, mirth, invisible, to, all, men, but, thyself, and, whisper, such, a, sad, tale, in, thine, ear, shall, make, thee, let, the, cup, fall, from, thy, hand, and, stand, as, mute, and, pale, as, death, itself, macbeth, was, first, printed, in, the, first, folio, of, 1623, and, the, folio, is, the, only, source, for, the, text, some, scholars, contend, that, the, folio, text, was, abridged, and, rearranged, from, an, earlier, manuscript, or, prompt, book, often, cited, as, interpolation, are, stage, cues, for, two, songs, whose, lyrics, are, not, included, in, the, folio, but, are, included, in, thomas, middleton, s, play, the, witch, which, was, written, between, the, accepted, date, for, macbeth, 1606, and, the, printing, of, the, folio, many, scholars, believe, these, songs, were, editorially, inserted, into, the, folio, though, whether, they, were, middleton, s, songs, or, preexisting, songs, is, not, certain, it, is, also, widely, believed, that, the, character, of, hecate, as, well, as, some, lines, of, the, first, witch, 4, 1, 124, 131, were, not, part, of, shakespeare, s, original, play, but, were, added, by, the, folio, editors, and, possibly, written, by, middleton, though, there, is, no, completely, objective, proof, of, such, interpolation, macbeth, the, prince, of, cumberland, that, is, a, step, on, which, i, must, fall, down, or, else, o, erleap, for, in, my, way, it, lies, stars, hide, your, fires, let, not, light, see, my, black, and, deep, desires, the, eye, wink, at, the, hand, yet, let, that, be, which, the, eye, fears, when, it, is, done, to, see, macbeth, act, i, scene, iv, macbeth, is, an, anomaly, among, shakespeare, s, tragedies, in, certain, critical, ways, it, is, short, more, than, a, thousand, lines, shorter, than, othello, and, king, lear, and, only, slightly, more, than, half, as, long, as, hamlet, this, brevity, has, suggested, to, many, critics, that, the, received, version, is, based, on, a, heavily, cut, source, perhaps, a, prompt, book, for, a, particular, performance, this, would, reflect, other, shakespeare, plays, existing, in, both, quarto, and, the, folio, where, the, quarto, versions, are, usually, longer, than, the, folio, versions, macbeth, was, first, printed, in, the, first, folio, but, has, no, quarto, version, if, there, were, a, quarto, it, would, probably, be, longer, than, the, folio, version, that, brevity, has, also, been, connected, to, other, unusual, features, the, fast, pace, of, the, first, act, which, has, seemed, to, be, stripped, for, action, and, the, comparative, flatness, of, the, characters, other, than, macbeth, a, c, bradley, in, considering, this, question, concluded, the, play, always, was, an, extremely, short, one, noting, the, witch, scenes, and, battle, scenes, would, have, taken, up, some, time, in, performance, remarking, i, do, not, think, that, in, reading, we, feel, macbeth, to, be, short, certainly, we, are, astonished, when, we, hear, it, is, about, half, as, long, as, hamlet, perhaps, in, the, shakespearean, theatre, too, it, seemed, to, occupy, a, longer, time, than, the, clock, recorded, at, least, since, the, days, of, samuel, johnson, analysis, of, the, play, has, centred, on, the, question, of, macbeth, s, ambition, commonly, seen, as, so, dominant, a, trait, that, it, defines, the, character, johnson, asserted, that, macbeth, though, esteemed, for, his, military, bravery, is, wholly, reviled, this, opinion, recurs, in, critical, literature, and, according, to, caroline, spurgeon, is, supported, by, shakespeare, himself, who, apparently, intended, to, degrade, his, hero, by, vesting, him, with, clothes, unsuited, to, him, and, to, make, macbeth, look, ridiculous, by, several, exaggerations, he, applies, his, garments, seem, either, too, big, or, too, small, for, him, as, his, ambition, is, too, big, and, his, character, too, small, for, his, new, and, unrightful, role, as, king, after, macbeth, is, unexpectedly, greeted, with, his, new, title, as, thane, of, cawdor, as, prophesied, by, the, witches, banquo, comments, new, honours, come, upon, him, like, our, strange, garments, cleave, not, to, their, mould, but, with, the, aid, of, use, and, at, the, end, when, the, tyrant, is, at, bay, at, dunsinane, caithness, sees, him, as, a, man, trying, in, vain, to, fasten, a, large, garment, on, him, with, too, small, a, belt, he, cannot, buckle, his, distemper, d, cause, within, the, belt, of, rule, while, angus, sums, up, what, everybody, thinks, ever, since, macbeth, s, accession, to, power, now, does, he, feel, his, title, hang, loose, about, him, like, a, giant, s, robe, upon, a, dwarfish, thief, like, richard, iii, but, without, that, character, s, perversely, appealing, exuberance, macbeth, wades, through, blood, until, his, inevitable, fall, as, kenneth, muir, writes, macbeth, has, not, a, predisposition, to, murder, he, has, merely, an, inordinate, ambition, that, makes, murder, itself, seem, to, be, a, lesser, evil, than, failure, to, achieve, the, crown, some, critics, such, as, e, e, stoll, explain, this, characterisation, as, a, holdover, from, senecan, or, medieval, tradition, shakespeare, s, audience, in, this, view, expected, villains, to, be, wholly, bad, and, senecan, style, far, from, prohibiting, a, villainous, protagonist, all, but, demanded, it, yet, for, other, critics, it, has, not, been, so, easy, to, resolve, the, question, of, macbeth, s, motivation, robert, bridges, for, instance, perceived, a, paradox, a, character, able, to, express, such, convincing, horror, before, duncan, s, murder, would, likely, be, incapable, of, committing, the, crime, for, many, critics, macbeth, s, motivations, in, the, first, act, appear, vague, and, insufficient, john, dover, wilson, hypothesised, that, shakespeare, s, original, text, had, an, extra, scene, or, scenes, where, husband, and, wife, discussed, their, plans, this, interpretation, is, not, fully, provable, however, the, motivating, role, of, ambition, for, macbeth, is, universally, recognised, the, evil, actions, motivated, by, his, ambition, seem, to, trap, him, in, a, cycle, of, increasing, evil, as, macbeth, himself, recognises, i, am, in, blood, stepp, d, in, so, far, that, should, i, wade, no, more, returning, were, as, tedious, as, go, o, er, while, working, on, russian, translations, of, shakespeare, s, works, boris, pasternak, compared, macbeth, to, raskolnikov, the, protagonist, of, crime, and, punishment, by, fyodor, dostoevsky, pasternak, argues, that, neither, macbeth, or, raskolnikov, is, a, born, criminal, or, a, villain, by, nature, they, are, turned, into, criminals, by, faulty, rationalizations, by, deductions, from, false, premises, he, goes, on, to, argue, that, lady, macbeth, is, feminine, one, of, those, active, insistent, wives, who, becomes, her, husband, s, executive, more, resolute, and, consistent, than, he, is, himself, according, to, pasternak, she, is, only, helping, macbeth, carry, out, his, own, wishes, to, her, own, detriment, the, disastrous, consequences, of, macbeth, s, ambition, are, not, limited, to, him, almost, from, the, moment, of, the, murder, the, play, depicts, scotland, as, a, land, shaken, by, inversions, of, the, natural, order, shakespeare, may, have, intended, a, reference, to, the, great, chain, of, being, although, the, play, s, images, of, disorder, are, mostly, not, specific, enough, to, support, detailed, intellectual, readings, he, may, also, have, intended, an, elaborate, compliment, to, james, s, belief, in, the, divine, right, of, kings, although, this, hypothesis, outlined, at, greatest, length, by, henry, n, paul, is, not, universally, accepted, as, in, julius, caesar, though, perturbations, in, the, political, sphere, are, echoed, and, even, amplified, by, events, in, the, material, world, among, the, most, often, depicted, of, the, inversions, of, the, natural, order, is, sleep, macbeth, s, announcement, that, he, has, murdered, sleep, is, figuratively, mirrored, in, lady, macbeth, s, sleepwalking, macbeth, s, generally, accepted, indebtedness, to, medieval, tragedy, is, often, seen, as, significant, in, the, play, s, treatment, of, moral, order, glynne, wickham, connects, the, play, through, the, porter, to, a, mystery, play, on, the, harrowing, of, hell, howard, felperin, argues, that, the, play, has, a, more, complex, attitude, toward, orthodox, christian, tragedy, than, is, often, admitted, he, sees, a, kinship, between, the, play, and, the, tyrant, plays, within, the, medieval, liturgical, drama, the, theme, of, androgyny, is, often, seen, as, a, special, aspect, of, the, theme, of, disorder, inversion, of, normative, gender, roles, is, most, famously, associated, with, the, witches, and, with, lady, macbeth, as, she, appears, in, the, first, act, whatever, shakespeare, s, degree, of, sympathy, with, such, inversions, the, play, ends, with, a, thorough, return, to, normative, gender, values, some, feminist, psychoanalytic, critics, such, as, janet, adelman, have, connected, the, play, s, treatment, of, gender, roles, to, its, larger, theme, of, inverted, natural, order, in, this, light, macbeth, is, punished, for, his, violation, of, the, moral, order, by, being, removed, from, the, cycles, of, nature, which, are, figured, as, female, nature, itself, as, embodied, in, the, movement, of, birnam, wood, is, part, of, the, restoration, of, moral, order, critics, in, the, early, twentieth, century, reacted, against, what, they, saw, as, an, excessive, dependence, on, the, study, of, character, in, criticism, of, the, play, this, dependence, though, most, closely, associated, with, a, c, bradley, is, clear, as, early, as, the, time, of, mary, cowden, clarke, who, offered, precise, if, fanciful, accounts, of, the, predramatic, lives, of, shakespeare, s, female, leads, she, suggested, for, instance, that, the, child, lady, macbeth, refers, to, in, the, first, act, died, during, a, foolish, military, action, in, the, play, the, three, witches, represent, darkness, chaos, and, conflict, while, their, role, is, as, agents, and, witnesses, their, presence, communicates, treason, and, impending, doom, during, shakespeare, s, day, witches, were, seen, as, worse, than, rebels, the, most, notorious, traytor, and, rebell, that, can, be, they, were, not, only, political, traitors, but, spiritual, traitors, as, well, much, of, the, confusion, that, springs, from, them, comes, from, their, ability, to, straddle, the, play, s, borders, between, reality, and, the, supernatural, they, are, so, deeply, entrenched, in, both, worlds, that, it, is, unclear, whether, they, control, fate, or, whether, they, are, merely, its, agents, they, defy, logic, not, being, subject, to, the, rules, of, the, real, world, the, witches, lines, in, the, first, act, fair, is, foul, and, foul, is, fair, hover, through, the, fog, and, filthy, air, are, often, said, to, set, the, tone, for, the, rest, of, the, play, by, establishing, a, sense, of, confusion, indeed, the, play, is, filled, with, situations, where, evil, is, depicted, as, good, while, good, is, rendered, evil, the, line, double, double, toil, and, trouble, communicates, the, witches, intent, clearly, they, seek, only, trouble, for, the, mortals, around, them, the, witches, spells, are, remarkably, similar, to, the, spells, of, the, witch, medusa, in, anthony, munday, s, play, fidele, and, fortunio, published, in, 1584, and, shakespeare, may, have, been, influenced, by, these, while, the, witches, do, not, tell, macbeth, directly, to, kill, king, duncan, they, use, a, subtle, form, of, temptation, when, they, tell, macbeth, that, he, is, destined, to, be, king, by, placing, this, thought, in, his, mind, they, effectively, guide, him, on, the, path, to, his, own, destruction, this, follows, the, pattern, of, temptation, used, at, the, time, of, shakespeare, first, they, argued, a, thought, is, put, in, a, man, s, mind, then, the, person, may, either, indulge, in, the, thought, or, reject, it, macbeth, indulges, in, it, while, banquo, rejects, according, to, j, a, bryant, jr, macbeth, also, makes, use, of, biblical, parallels, notably, between, king, duncan, s, murder, and, the, murder, of, christ, no, matter, how, one, looks, at, it, whether, as, history, or, as, tragedy, macbeth, is, distinctively, christian, one, may, simply, count, the, biblical, allusions, as, richmond, noble, has, done, one, may, go, further, and, study, the, parallels, between, shakespeare, s, story, and, the, old, testament, stories, of, saul, and, jezebel, as, miss, jane, h, jack, has, done, or, one, may, examine, with, w, c, curry, the, progressive, degeneration, of, macbeth, from, the, point, of, view, of, medieval, theology, while, many, today, would, say, that, any, misfortune, surrounding, a, production, is, mere, coincidence, actors, and, others, in, the, theatre, industry, often, consider, it, bad, luck, to, mention, macbeth, by, name, while, inside, a, theatre, and, sometimes, refer, to, it, indirectly, for, example, as, the, scottish, play, or, macbee, or, when, referring, to, the, characters, and, not, the, play, mr, and, mrs, m, or, the, scottish, king, this, is, because, shakespeare, or, the, play, s, revisers, is, said, to, have, used, the, spells, of, real, witches, in, his, text, purportedly, angering, the, witches, and, causing, them, to, curse, the, play, thus, to, say, the, name, of, the, play, inside, a, theatre, is, believed, to, doom, the, production, to, failure, and, perhaps, cause, physical, injury, or, death, to, cast, members, there, are, stories, of, accidents, misfortunes, and, even, deaths, taking, place, during, runs, of, macbeth, according, to, the, actor, sir, donald, sinden, in, his, sky, arts, tv, series, great, west, end, theatres, contrary, to, popular, myth, shakespeare, s, tragedy, macbeth, is, not, the, unluckiest, play, as, superstition, likes, to, portray, it, exactly, the, opposite, the, origin, of, the, unfortunate, moniker, dates, back, to, repertory, theatre, days, when, each, town, and, village, had, at, least, one, theatre, to, entertain, the, public, if, a, play, was, not, doing, well, it, would, invariably, get, pulled, and, replaced, with, a, sure, fire, audience, pleaser, macbeth, guaranteed, full, houses, so, when, the, weekly, theatre, newspaper, the, stage, was, published, listing, what, was, on, in, each, theatre, in, the, country, it, was, instantly, noticed, what, shows, had, not, worked, the, previous, week, as, they, had, been, replaced, by, a, definite, crowd, pleaser, more, actors, have, died, during, performances, of, hamlet, than, in, the, scottish, play, as, the, profession, still, calls, it, it, is, forbidden, to, quote, from, it, backstage, as, this, could, cause, the, current, play, to, collapse, and, have, to, be, replaced, causing,

a, lucky, play, sir, patrick, stewart, on, the, radio, program, ask, me, another, asserted, if, you, have, played, the, role, of, the, scottish, thane, then, you, are, allowed, to, say, the, title, any, time, anywhere, the, only, eyewitness, account, of, macbeth, in, shakespeare, s, lifetime, was, recorded, by, simon, forman, who, saw, a, performance, at, the, globe, on, 20, april, 1610, scholars, have, noted, discrepancies, between, forman, s, account, and, the, play, as, it, appears, in, the, folio, for, example, he, makes, no, mention, of, the, apparition, scene, or, of, hecate, of, the, man, not, of, woman, born, or, of, birnam, wood, however, clark, observes, that, forman, s, accounts, were, often, inaccurate, and, incomplete, for, instance, omitting, the, statue, scene, from, the, winter, s, tale, and, his, interest, did, not, seem, to, be, in, giving, full, accounts, of, the, productions, as, mentioned, above, the, folio, text, is, thought, by, some, to, be, an, alteration, of, the, original, play, this, has, led, to, the, theory, that, the, play, as, we, know, it, from, the, folio, was, an, adaptation, for, indoor, performance, at, the, blackfriars, theatre, which, was, operated, by, the, king, s, men, from, 1608, and, even, speculation, that, it, represents, a, specific, performance, before, king, james, the, play, contains, more, musical, cues, than, any, other, play, in, the, canon, as, well, as, a, significant, use, of, sound, effects, the, chill, of, the, grave, seemed, about, you, when, you, looked, on, her, there, was, the, hush, and, damp,

introducing, new, songs, dances, and, flying, and, the, expansion, of, the, role, of, lady, macduff, as, a, foil, to, lady, macbeth, there, were, however, performances, outside, the, patent,

excellent, play, in, all, respects, on, 19, april, 1667, one, of, the, best, plays, for, a, stage, that, ever, i, saw, again, on, 16, october, 1667, was, vexed, to, see, young, who, is, but, a, bad, actor, at, best, act, macbeth, in, the, room, of, betterton, who, poor, man, is, sick, and, again, three, weeks, later, on, 6, november, 1667, macbeth, which, we, still, like, mightily, yet, again, on, 12, august, 1668, saw, macbeth, to, our, great, content, and, finally, on, 21, december, 1668, on, which, date, the, king, and, court, were, also, present, in, the, audience, the, first, professional, performances, of, macbeth, in, north, america, were, probably, those, of, the, hallam, company, in, 1744, david, garrick, revived, the, play, abandoning, davenant, s, version, and, instead, advertising, it, as, written, by, shakespeare, in, fact, this, claim, was, largely, false, he, retained, much, of, davenant, s, more, popular, business, for, the, witches, and, himself, wrote, a, lengthy, death, speech, for, macbeth, and, he, cut, more, than, 10, of, shakespeare, s, play, including, the, drunken, porter, the, murder, of, lady, macduff, s, son, and, malcolm, s, testing, of, macduff, hannah, pritchard, was, his, greatest, stage, partner, having, her, premiere, as, his, lady, macbeth, in, 1747, he, would, later, drop, the, play, from, his, repertoire, upon, her, retirement, from, the, stage, mrs, pritchard, was, the, first, actress, to, achieve, acclaim, in, the, role, of, lady, macbeth, at, least, partly, due, to, the, removal, of, davenant, s, material, which, made, irrelevant, moral, contrasts, with, lady, macduff, garrick, s, portrayal, focused, on, the, inner, life, of, the, character, endowing, him, with, an, innocence, vacillating, between, good, and, evil, and, betrayed, by, outside, influences, he, portrayed, a, man, capable, of, observing, himself, as, if, a, part, of, him, remained, untouched, by, what, he, had, done, the, play, moulding, him, into, a, man, of, sensibility, rather, than, him, descending, into, a, tyrant, john, philip, kemble, first, played, macbeth, in, 1778, although, usually, regarded, as, the, antithesis, of, garrick, kemble, nevertheless, refined, aspects, of, garrick, s, portrayal, into, his, own, however, it, was, the, towering, and, majestic, sarah, siddons, kemble, s, sister, who, became, a, legend, in, the, role, of, lady, macbeth, in, contrast, to, hannah, pritchard, s, savage, demonic, portrayal, siddons, lady, macbeth, while, terrifying, was, nevertheless, in, the, scenes, in, which, she, expresses, her, regret, and, remorse, tenderly, human, and, in, portraying, her, actions, as, done, out, of, love, for, her, husband, siddons, deflected, from, him, some, of, the, moral, responsibility, for, the, play, s, carnage, audiences, seem, to, have, found, the, sleepwalking, scene, particularly, mesmerising, hazlitt, said, of, it, that, all, her, gestures, were, involuntary, and, mechanical, she, glided, on, and, off, the, stage, almost, like, an, apparition, in, 1794, kemble, dispensed, with, the, ghost, of, banquo, altogether, allowing, the, audience, to, see, macbeth, s, reaction, as, his, wife, and, guests, see, it, and, relying, upon, the, fact, that, the, play, was, so, well, known, that, his, audience, would, already, be, aware, that, a, ghost,

choral, performance, which, circumvented, the, illegality, of, speaking, shakespeare, s, words, through, mimed, action, singing, and, doggerel, verse, written, by, j, c, cross, in, 1809, in, an, unsuccessful, attempt, to, take, covent, garden, upmarket, kemble, installed, private, boxes, increasing, admission, prices, to, pay, for, the, improvements, the, inaugural, run, at, the, newly,

in, 1820, and, finally, in, his, retirement, performance, although, his, playing, evolved, over, the, years, it, was, noted, throughout, for, the, tension, between, the, idealistic, aspects, and, the, weaker, venal, aspects, of, macbeth, s, character, his, staging, was, full, of, spectacle, including, several, elaborate, royal, processions, in, 1843, the, theatres, regulation, act, finally,
