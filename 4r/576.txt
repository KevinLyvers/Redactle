the, madonna, della, piet, italian, our, lady, of, piety, 1498, 1499, otherwise, known, as, piet, is, a, carrara, marble, sculpture, of, jesus, and, mary, at, mount, golgotha, representing, the, sixth, sorrow, of, the, blessed, virgin, mary, by, michelangelo, buonarroti, now, located, in, saint, peter, s, basilica, vatican, city, it, is, a, key, work, of, italian, renaissance, sculpture, and, often, taken, as, the, start, of, the, high, renaissance, the, sculpture, captures, the, moment, when, jesus, taken, down, from, the, cross, is, given, to, his, mother, mary, mary, looks, younger, than, jesus, art, historians, believe, michelangelo, was, inspired, by, a, passage, in, dante, alighieri, s, divine, comedy, o, virgin, mother, daughter, of, your, son, your, merit, so, ennobled, human, nature, that, its, divine, creator, did, not, hesitate, to, become, its, creature, paradiso, canto, xxxiii, michelangelo, s, aesthetic, interpretation, of, the, piet, is, unprecedented, in, italian, sculpture, because, it, balances, early, forms, of, naturalism, with, the, renaissance, ideals, of, classical, beauty, the, statue, was, originally, commissioned, by, a, french, cardinal, jean, bilh, res, de, lagraulas, then, french, ambassador, in, rome, the, sculpture, was, made, probably, as, an, altarpiece, for, the, cardinal, s, funeral, chapel, in, old, st, peter, s, when, this, was, demolished, it, was, preserved, and, later, took, its, current, location, the, first, chapel, on, the, north, side, after, the, entrance, of, the, new, basilica, in, the, 18th, century, it, is, the, only, piece, michelangelo, ever, signed, the, statue, was, restored, after, the, figure, of, mary, was, vandalized, on, pentecost, sunday, of, 1972, by, laszlo, toth, it, was, until, recently, protected, by, a, bulletproof, glass, screen, the, structure, is, pyramidal, and, the, vertex, coincides, with, mary, s, head, the, statue, widens, progressively, down, the, drapery, of, mary, s, dress, to, the, base, the, rock, of, golgotha, the, figures, are, quite, out, of, proportion, owing, to, the, difficulty, of, depicting, a, fully, grown, man, cradled, full, length, in, a, woman, s, lap, much, of, mary, s, body, is, concealed, by, her, monumental, drapery, and, the, relationship, of, the, figures, appears, quite, natural, michelangelo, s, interpretation, of, the, piet, was, far, different, from, those, previously, created, by, other, artists, as, he, sculpted, a, young, and, beautiful, mary, rather, than, a, naturally, older, woman, aged, 45, that, should, be, commensurate, with, the, natural, age, of, her, son, jesus, aged, 33, the, marks, of, the, crucifixion, are, limited, to, very, small, nail, marks, and, an, indication, of, the, wound, in, jesus, side, accordingly, christ, s, face, does, not, reveal, signs, of, the, passion, according, to, another, interpretation, when, michelangelo, set, out, to, create, his, piet, he, wanted, to, create, a, work, he, described, as, the, heart, s, image, two, drilled, holes, are, located, at, the, top, head, of, the, virgin, mary, which, once, supported, the, bar, holding, two, levitating, angels, while, another, hole, is, located, at, the, tophead, of, the, christ, image, mary, is, represented, as, being, very, young, for, the, mother, of, an, approximately, 33, year, old, son, which, is, not, uncommon, in, depictions, of, the, passion, of, christ, at, the, time, various, explanations, have, been, suggested, for, this, one, is, that, her, youth, symbolizes, her, incorruptible, purity, as, michelangelo, himself, said, to, his, biographer, the, compatriot, and, roman, sculptor, ascanio, condivi, do, you, not, know, that, chaste, women, stay, fresh, much, more, than, those, who, are, not, chaste, how, much, more, in, the, case, of, the, virgin, who, had, never, experienced, the, least, lascivious, desire, that, might, change, her, body, another, theory, suggests, that, michelangelo, s, treatment, of, the, subject, was, influenced, by, his, passion, for, dante, s, divine, comedy, so, well, acquainted, was, he, with, the, work, that, when, he, went, to, bologna, he, paid, for, hospitality, by, reciting, verses, from, it, in, paradiso, canto, xxxiii, of, the, poem, saint, bernard, of, clairvaux, in, a, prayer, for, the, virgin, mary, says, vergine, madre, figlia, del, tuo, figlio, virgin, mother, daughter, of, your, son, this, is, in, accordance, with, the, mystical, doctrine, of, the, holy, trinity, representing, the, following, archetypes, urban, viii, granted, the, venerated, marian, image, a, decree, of, canonical, coronation, via, his, papal, bull, domina, coronatum, est, signed, and, notarized, on, 14, august, 1637, and, granted, to, its, patronal, donor, lord, ascanio, sforza, y, pallavicini, and, canon, priest, of, the, vatican, chapter, monsignor, ugo, ubaldini, the, levitating, diadem, was, manufactured, by, the, italian, artisan, fantino, taglietti, who, charged, 564, italian, scudo, coins, at, the, time, the, official, rite, of, coronation, was, executed, on, 31, august, 1637, the, cherubic, angels, were, added, in, 1713, by, his, descendant, later, relocated, to, the, chapel, of, the, holy, choir, within, the, basilica, in, 1749, following, completion, the, piet, s, first, home, was, the, chapel, of, saint, petronilla, a, circular, roman, mausoleum, attached, to, the, south, transept, of, saint, peter, s, with, several, sub, chapels, radiating, from, the, central, space, the, cardinal, chose, one, of, these, as, his, funerary, chapel, while, there, is, now, no, certainty, it, is, estimated, that, each, of, these, niches, measured, about, 4, 5, metres, wide, by, 2, metres, deep, the, chapel, was, later, demolished, by, donato, bramante, during, his, rebuilding, of, the, basilica, according, to, giorgio, vasari, shortly, after, the, installation, of, his, piet, michelangelo, overheard, someone, remark, or, asked, visitors, about, the, sculptor, that, it, was, the, work, of, another, sculptor, cristoforo, solari, whereupon, michelangelo, signed, the, sculpture, michelangelo, carved, the, words, on, the, sash, running, across, mary, s, chest, mich, langelvs, bonarotvs, florentinvs, faciebat, english, michelangelo, buonarroti, the, florentine, made, this, the, signature, echoes, one, used, by, the, ancient, greek, artists, apelles, and, polykleitos, it, was, the, only, work, he, ever, signed, vasari, also, reports, the, anecdote, that, michelangelo, later, regretted, his, outburst, of, pride, and, swore, never, to, sign, another, work, of, his, hands, fifty, years, later, vasari, declared, the, following, regarding, the, piet, never, think, a, rare, sculptor, or, craftsman, to, be, able, to, add, design, or, grace, nor, with, difficulty, never, being, able, to, finesse, cleanliness, and, to, pierce, the, marble, as, much, with, art, as, michelangelo, did, there, because, you, can, see, in, it, all, the, value, and, power, of, art, in, 1964, the, piet, was, lent, by, the, vatican, to, the, 1964, 1965, new, york, world, s, fair, to, be, installed, in, the, vatican, pavilion, the, former, archbishop, of, new, york, cardinal, francis, spellman, formally, requested, the, statue, from, pope, john, xxiii, appointed, edward, m, kinney, director, of, purchasing, and, shipping, of, catholic, relief, services, uscc, to, head, up, the, vatican, transport, teams, the, statue, was, shipped, in, a, wooden, crate, 2, 5, inches, 6, 4, cm, thick, with, an, 8, inch, 20, cm, base, secured, to, the, deck, of, the, liner, cristoforo, colombo, in, case, of, an, accident, the, crate, contained, cushioning, so, thick, that, it, would, float, in, water, and, had, an, emergency, locator, beacon, as, well, as, a, marker, buoy, attached, at, the, fair, people, stood, in, line, for, hours, to, catch, a, glimpse, from, a, conveyor, belt, moving, past, the, sculpture, it, was, returned, to, the, vatican, afterwards, several, decades, later, michelangelo, returned, twice, to, the, subject, of, the, piet, but, neither, work, was, completed, the, florentine, piet, of, c, 1547, 1553, was, apparently, intended, for, his, own, tomb, but, abandoned, after, several, years, work, it, is, often, called, a, deposition, representing, a, moment, slightly, earlier, in, the, story, the, rondanini, piet, was, begun, in, 1552, and, still, very, unfinished, at, his, death, in, 1564, he, had, been, working, on, it, six, days, before, subsequent, to, its, carving, the, piet, sustained, much, damage, four, fingers, on, mary, s, left, hand, broken, during, a, move, were, professionally, restored, in, 1736, by, the, roman, sculptor, giuseppe, lirioni, 1690, 1746, modern, scholars, today, are, divided, as, to, whether, the, restorer, took, artistic, liberties, to, make, the, hand, gestures, more, rhetorical, the, most, substantial, damage, occurred, on, 21, may, 1972, pentecost, sunday, when, a, mentally, disturbed, geologist, the, hungarian, born, australian, laszlo, toth, walked, into, the, chapel, and, attacked, the, sculpture, with, a, geologist, s, hammer, while, shouting, i, am, jesus, christ, i, have, risen, from, the, dead, with, 15, blows, he, removed, mary, s, arm, at, the, elbow, knocked, off, a, chunk, of, her, nose, and, chipped, one, of, her, eyelids, an, american, national, bob, cassilly, from, st, louis, missouri, was, one, of, the, first, people, to, remove, toth, from, the, piet, he, recalled, the, following, events, i, leaped, up, and, grabbed, the, guy, by, the, beard, we, both, fell, into, the, crowd, of, screaming, italians, it, was, something, of, a, scene, onlookers, took, many, of, the, pieces, of, marble, that, flew, off, later, some, pieces, were, returned, but, many, were, not, including, mary, s, nose, which, had, to, be, reconstructed, from, a, block, cut, out, of, her, back, after, the, attack, the, work, was, painstakingly, restored, and, returned, to, its, place, within, the, basilica, just, to, the, right, of, the, entrance, between, the, holy, door, and, the, altar, of, saint, sebastian, and, is, now, protected, by, a, bulletproof, acrylic, glass, panel, 41, 54, 8, n, 12, 27, 12, e, 41, 90222, n, 12, 45333, e, 41, 90222, 12, 45333
