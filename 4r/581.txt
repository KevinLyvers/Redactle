the, bayeux, tapestry, uk, b, a, j, b, e, us, b, e, j, u, b, a, b, a, y, yoo, french, tapisserie, de, bayeux, or, la, telle, du, conquest, latin, tapete, baiocense, is, an, embroidered, cloth, nearly, 70, metres, 230, feet, long, and, 50, centimetres, 20, inches, tall, that, depicts, the, events, leading, up, to, the, norman, conquest, of, england, in, 1066, led, by, william, duke, of, normandy, challenging, harold, ii, king, of, england, and, culminating, in, the, battle, of, hastings, it, is, thought, to, date, to, the, 11th, century, within, a, few, years, of, the, battle, now, widely, accepted, to, have, been, made, in, england, perhaps, as, a, gift, for, william, it, tells, the, story, from, the, point, of, view, of, the, conquering, normans, and, for, centuries, has, been, preserved, in, normandy, according, to, sylvette, lemagnen, conservator, of, the, tapestry, in, her, 2005, book, la, tapisserie, de, bayeux, the, bayeux, tapestry, is, one, of, the, supreme, achievements, of, the, norman, romanesque, its, survival, almost, intact, over, nine, centuries, is, little, short, of, miraculous, its, exceptional, length, the, harmony, and, freshness, of, its, colours, its, exquisite, workmanship, and, the, genius, of, its, guiding, spirit, combine, to, make, it, endlessly, fascinating, the, cloth, consists, of, 58, scenes, many, with, latin, tituli, embroidered, on, linen, with, coloured, woollen, yarns, it, is, likely, that, it, was, commissioned, by, bishop, odo, of, bayeux, william, s, maternal, half, brother, and, made, for, him, in, england, in, the, 1070s, in, 1729, the, hanging, was, rediscovered, by, scholars, at, a, time, when, it, was, being, displayed, annually, in, bayeux, cathedral, the, tapestry, is, now, exhibited, at, the, mus, e, de, la, tapisserie, de, bayeux, in, bayeux, normandy, france, 49, 16, 28, n, 0, 42, 01, w, 49, 2744, n, 0, 7003, w, 49, 2744, 0, 7003, the, designs, on, the, bayeux, tapestry, are, embroidered, rather, than, in, a, tapestry, weave, so, it, does, not, meet, narrower, definitions, of, a, tapestry, nevertheless, it, has, always, been, referred, to, as, a, tapestry, until, recent, years, when, the, name, bayeux, embroidery, has, gained, ground, among, certain, art, historians, it, can, be, seen, as, a, rare, example, of, secular, romanesque, art, tapestries, adorned, both, churches, and, wealthy, houses, in, medieval, western, europe, though, at, 0, 5, by, 68, 38, m, 1, ft, 8, in, by, 224, ft, 4, in, the, bayeux, tapestry, is, exceptionally, large, only, the, figures, and, decoration, are, embroidered, on, a, background, left, plain, which, shows, the, subject, very, clearly, and, was, necessary, to, cover, large, areas, the, earliest, known, written, reference, to, the, tapestry, is, a, 1476, inventory, of, bayeux, cathedral, but, its, origins, have, been, the, subject, of, much, speculation, and, controversy, french, legend, maintained, the, tapestry, was, commissioned, and, created, by, queen, matilda, william, the, conqueror, s, wife, and, her, ladies, in, waiting, indeed, in, france, it, is, occasionally, known, as, la, tapisserie, de, la, reine, mathilde, the, tapestry, of, queen, matilda, however, scholarly, analysis, in, the, 20th, century, concluded, it, was, probably, commissioned, by, william, s, half, brother, bishop, odo, of, bayeux, who, after, the, conquest, also, became, earl, of, kent, and, when, william, was, absent, in, normandy, regent, of, england, the, reasons, for, the, odo, commission, theory, include, assuming, odo, commissioned, the, tapestry, it, was, probably, designed, and, constructed, in, england, by, anglo, saxon, artists, odo, s, main, power, base, being, by, then, in, kent, the, latin, text, contains, hints, of, anglo, saxon, other, embroideries, originate, from, england, at, this, time, and, the, vegetable, dyes, can, be, found, in, cloth, traditionally, woven, there, howard, b, clarke, has, proposed, that, the, designer, of, the, tapestry, i, e, the, individual, responsible, for, its, overall, narrative, and, political, argument, was, scolland, the, abbot, of, st, augustine, s, abbey, in, canterbury, because, of, his, previous, position, as, head, of, the, scriptorium, at, mont, saint, michel, famed, for, its, illumination, his, travels, to, trajan, s, column, and, his, connections, to, wadard, and, vital, two, individuals, identified, in, the, tapestry, alternatively, christine, grainge, has, argued, that, the, designer, may, have, been, lanfranc, archbishop, of, canterbury, 1070, 1089, the, actual, physical, work, of, stitching, was, most, probably, undertaken, by, female, needleworkers, anglo, saxon, needlework, of, the, more, detailed, type, known, as, opus, anglicanum, was, famous, across, europe, it, was, perhaps, commissioned, for, display, in, the, hall, of, odo, s, palace, in, bayeux, and, then, bequeathed, to, the, cathedral, he, had, built, following, the, precedent, of, the, documented, but, lost, hanging, of, the, anglo, saxon, warrior, byrhtnoth, bequeathed, by, his, widow, to, ely, abbey, other, theories, exist, carola, hicks, has, suggested, the, tapestry, could, possibly, have, been, commissioned, by, edith, of, wessex, widow, of, edward, the, confessor, and, sister, of, harold, wolfgang, grape, has, challenged, the, consensus, that, the, embroidery, is, anglo, saxon, distinguishing, between, anglo, saxon, and, other, northern, european, techniques, medieval, material, authority, elizabeth, coatsworth, contradicted, this, the, attempt, to, distinguish, anglo, saxon, from, other, northern, european, embroideries, before, 1100, on, the, grounds, of, technique, cannot, be, upheld, on, the, basis, of, present, knowledge, george, beech, suggests, the, tapestry, was, executed, at, the, abbey, of, saint, florent, de, saumur, in, the, loire, valley, and, says, the, detailed, depiction, of, the, breton, campaign, argues, for, additional, sources, in, france, andrew, bridgeford, has, suggested, that, the, tapestry, was, actually, of, english, design, and, encoded, with, secret, messages, meant, to, undermine, norman, rule, the, first, reference, to, the, tapestry, is, from, 1476, when, it, was, listed, in, an, inventory, of, the, treasures, of, bayeux, cathedral, it, survived, the, sack, of, bayeux, by, the, huguenots, in, 1562, and, the, next, certain, reference, is, from, 1724, antoine, lancelot, sent, a, report, to, the, acad, mie, royale, des, inscriptions, et, belles, lettres, concerning, a, sketch, he, had, received, about, a, work, concerning, william, the, conqueror, he, had, no, idea, where, or, what, the, original, was, although, he, suggested, it, could, have, been, a, tapestry, despite, further, enquiries, he, discovered, no, more, the, benedictine, scholar, bernard, de, montfaucon, made, more, successful, investigations, and, found, that, the, sketch, was, of, a, small, portion, of, a, tapestry, preserved, at, bayeux, cathedral, in, 1729, and, 1730, he, published, drawings, and, a, detailed, description, of, the, complete, work, in, the, first, two, volumes, of, his, les, monuments, de, la, monarchie, fran, aise, the, drawings, were, by, antoine, beno, t, one, of, the, ablest, draughtsmen, of, that, time, the, tapestry, was, first, briefly, noted, in, english, in, 1746, by, william, stukeley, in, his, palaeographia, britannica, the, first, detailed, account, in, english, was, written, by, smart, lethieullier, who, was, living, in, paris, in, 1732, 3, and, was, acquainted, with, lancelot, and, de, montfaucon, it, was, not, published, however, until, 1767, as, an, appendix, to, andrew, ducarel, s, anglo, norman, antiquities, during, the, french, revolution, in, 1792, the, tapestry, was, confiscated, as, public, property, to, be, used, for, covering, military, wagons, it, was, rescued, from, a, wagon, by, a, local, lawyer, who, stored, it, in, his, house, until, the, troubles, were, over, whereupon, he, sent, it, to, the, city, administrators, for, safekeeping, after, the, reign, of, terror, the, fine, arts, commission, set, up, to, safeguard, national, treasures, in, 1803, required, it, to, be, removed, to, paris, for, display, at, the, mus, e, napol, on, when, napoleon, abandoned, his, planned, invasion, of, britain, the, tapestry, s, propaganda, value, was, lost, and, it, was, returned, to, bayeux, where, the, council, displayed, it, on, a, winding, apparatus, of, two, cylinders, despite, scholars, concern, that, the, tapestry, was, becoming, damaged, the, council, refused, to, return, it, to, the, cathedral, in, 1816, the, society, of, antiquaries, of, london, commissioned, its, historical, draughtsman, charles, stothard, to, visit, bayeux, to, make, an, accurate, hand, coloured, facsimile, of, the, tapestry, his, drawings, were, subsequently, engraved, by, james, basire, jr, and, published, by, the, society, in, 1819, 23, stothard, s, images, are, still, of, value, as, a, record, of, the, tapestry, as, it, was, before, 19th, century, restoration, by, 1842, the, tapestry, was, displayed, in, a, special, purpose, room, in, the, biblioth, que, publique, it, required, special, storage, in, 1870, with, the, threatened, invasion, of, normandy, in, the, franco, prussian, war, and, again, in, 1939, 1944, by, the, ahnenerbe, during, the, german, occupation, of, france, and, the, normandy, landings, on, 27, june, 1944, the, gestapo, took, the, tapestry, to, the, louvre, and, on, 18, august, three, days, before, the, wehrmacht, withdrew, from, paris, himmler, sent, a, message, intercepted, by, bletchley, park, ordering, it, to, be, taken, to, a, place, of, safety, thought, to, be, berlin, it, was, only, on, 22, august, that, the, ss, attempted, to, take, possession, of, the, tapestry, by, which, time, the, louvre, was, again, in, french, hands, after, the, liberation, of, paris, on, 25, august, the, tapestry, was, again, put, on, public, display, in, the, louvre, and, in, 1945, it, was, returned, to, bayeux, where, it, is, exhibited, at, the, mus, e, de, la, tapisserie, de, bayeux, the, inventory, listing, of, 1476, shows, that, the, tapestry, was, being, hung, annually, in, bayeux, cathedral, for, the, week, of, the, feast, of, st, john, the, baptist, this, was, still, the, case, in, 1728, although, by, that, time, the, purpose, was, merely, to, air, the, hanging, which, was, otherwise, stored, in, a, chest, clearly, the, work, was, being, well, cared, for, in, the, eighteenth, century, the, artistry, was, regarded, as, crude, or, even, barbarous, red, and, yellow, multi, coloured, horses, upset, some, critics, it, was, thought, to, be, unfinished, because, the, linen, was, not, covered, with, embroidery, however, its, exhibition, in, the, louvre, in, 1797, caused, a, sensation, with, le, moniteur, which, normally, dealt, with, foreign, affairs, reporting, on, it, on, its, first, two, pages, it, inspired, a, popular, musical, la, tapisserie, de, la, reine, mathilde, it, was, because, the, tapestry, was, regarded, as, an, antiquity, rather, than, a, work, of, art, that, in, 1804, it, was, returned, to, bayeux, wherein, 1823, one, commentator, a, l, l, chaud, d, anisy, reported, that, there, is, a, sort, of, purity, in, its, primitive, forms, especially, considering, the, state, of, the, arts, in, the, eleventh, century, the, tapestry, was, becoming, a, tourist, attraction, with, robert, southey, complaining, of, the, need, to, queue, to, see, the, work, in, the, 1843, hand, book, for, travellers, in, france, by, john, murray, iii, a, visit, was, included, on, recommended, route, 26, caen, to, cherbourg, via, bayeux, and, this, guidebook, led, john, ruskin, to, go, there, he, would, describe, the, tapestry, as, the, most, interesting, thing, in, its, way, conceivable, charles, dickens, however, was, not, impressed, it, is, certainly, the, work, of, amateurs, very, feeble, amateurs, at, the, beginning, and, very, heedless, some, of, them, too, during, the, second, world, war, heinrich, himmler, coveted, the, work, regarding, it, as, important, for, our, glorious, and, cultured, germanic, history, in, 2018, french, president, emmanuel, macron, announced, that, the, bayeux, tapestry, would, be, loaned, to, britain, for, public, display, it, had, been, expected, to, be, exhibited, at, the, british, museum, in, london, in, 2022, but, strong, objections, were, raised, on, conservation, grounds, it, would, be, the, first, time, in, 950, years, that, the, tapesty, had, left, france, although, evidence, suggests, that, the, tapestry, was, made, in, canterbury, as, of, april, 2024, however, a, date, for, the, loan, had, not, yet, been, finalised, in, common, with, other, embroidered, hangings, of, the, early, medieval, period, this, piece, is, conventionally, referred, to, as, a, tapestry, although, it, is, not, a, true, tapestry, in, which, the, design, is, woven, into, the, cloth, in, tapestry, weave, it, is, technically, an, embroidery, although, it, meets, the, traditional, broader, definition, of, tapestry, as, a, textile, fabric, decorated, with, designs, of, ornament, or, pictorial, subjects, painted, embroidered, or, woven, in, colours, used, for, wall, hangings, curtains, covers, for, seats, the, bayeux, tapestry, is, embroidered, in, crewel, wool, yarn, on, a, tabby, woven, linen, ground, 68, 38, metres, long, and, 0, 5, metres, wide, 224, 3, ft, 1, 6, ft, and, using, two, methods, of, stitching, outline, or, stem, stitch, for, lettering, and, the, outlines, of, figures, and, couching, or, laid, work, for, filling, in, figures, nine, linen, panels, between, fourteen, and, three, metres, in, length, were, sewn, together, after, each, was, embroidered, and, the, joins, were, disguised, with, subsequent, embroidery, at, the, first, join, start, of, scene, 14, the, borders, do, not, line, up, properly, but, the, technique, was, improved, so, that, the, later, joins, are, practically, invisible, the, design, involved, a, broad, central, zone, with, narrow, decorative, borders, top, and, bottom, by, inspecting, the, woollen, threads, behind, the, linen, it, is, apparent, all, these, aspects, were, embroidered, together, at, a, session, and, the, awkward, placing, of, the, tituli, is, not, due, to, them, being, added, later, later, generations, have, patched, the, hanging, in, numerous, places, and, some, of, the, embroidery, especially, in, the, final, scene, has, been, reworked, the, tapestry, may, well, have, maintained, much, of, its, original, appearance, it, now, compares, closely, with, a, careful, drawing, made, in, 1730, the, end, of, the, tapestry, has, been, missing, from, time, immemorial, and, the, final, titulus, et, fuga, verterunt, angli, and, the, english, left, fleeing, is, said, to, be, entirely, spurious, added, shortly, before, 1814, at, a, time, of, anti, english, sentiment, musset, speculates, the, hanging, was, originally, about, 1, 5, metres, longer, at, the, last, section, still, remaining, the, embroidery, has, been, almost, completely, restored, but, this, seems, to, have, been, done, with, at, least, some, regard, to, the, original, stitching, the, stylised, tree, is, quite, unlike, any, other, tree, in, the, tapestry, the, start, of, the, tapestry, has, also, been, restored, but, to, a, much, lesser, extent, norton, has, reviewed, the, various, measurements, of, the, length, of, the, tapestry, itself, and, of, its, nine, individual, linen, panels, he, has, also, attempted, to, estimate, the, size, and, architectural, design, of, the, 11th, century, bayeux, cathedral, he, considers, the, tapestry, would, have, fitted, well, if, it, had, been, hung, along, the, south, west, and, north, arcades, of, the, nave, and, that, the, scenes, it, depicts, can, be, correlated, with, positions, of, the, arcade, bays, in, a, way, that, would, have, been, dramatically, satisfying, he, agrees, with, earlier, speculation, that, a, final, panel, is, missing, one, that, shows, william, s, coronation, and, which, he, thinks, was, some, three, metres, long, norton, concludes, that, the, tapestry, was, definitely, designed, to, be, hung, in, bayeux, cathedral, specifically, that, it, was, designed, to, appeal, to, a, norman, audience, and, that, it, was, probably, designed, for, bishop, odo, so, as, to, be, displayed, at, the, dedication, of, the, cathedral, in, 1077, in, the, presence, of, william, matilda, their, sons, and, odo, the, main, yarn, colours, are, terracotta, or, russet, blue, green, dull, gold, olive, green, and, blue, with, small, amounts, of, dark, blue, or, black, and, sage, green, later, repairs, are, worked, in, light, yellow, orange, and, light, greens, laid, yarns, are, couched, in, place, with, yarn, of, the, same, or, contrasting, colour, the, tapestry, s, central, zone, contains, most, of, the, action, which, sometimes, overflows, into, the, borders, either, for, dramatic, effect, or, because, depictions, would, otherwise, be, very, cramped, for, example, at, edward, s, death, scene, events, take, place, in, a, long, series, of, scenes, which, are, generally, separated, by, highly, stylised, trees, however, the, trees, are, not, placed, consistently, and, the, greatest, scene, shift, between, harold, s, audience, with, edward, after, his, return, to, england, and, edward, s, burial, scene, is, not, marked, in, any, way, at, all, the, tituli, are, normally, in, the, central, zone, but, occasionally, use, the, top, border, the, borders, are, otherwise, mostly, purely, decorative, and, only, sometimes, does, the, decoration, complement, the, action, in, the, central, zone, the, decoration, consists, of, birds, beasts, fish, and, scenes, from, fables, agriculture, and, hunting, there, are, frequent, oblique, bands, separating, the, vignettes, there, are, nude, figures, some, of, corpses, from, battle, others, of, a, ribald, nature, a, harrow, a, newly, invented, implement, is, depicted, scene, 10, and, this, is, the, earliest, known, depiction, the, picture, of, halley, s, comet, which, appears, in, the, upper, border, scene, 32, is, the, first, known, picture, of, this, comet, in, 1724, a, linen, backing, cloth, was, sewn, on, comparatively, crudely, and, in, around, the, year, 1800, large, ink, numerals, were, written, on, the, backing, which, broadly, enumerate, each, scene, and, which, are, still, commonly, used, for, reference, in, a, series, of, pictures, supported, by, a, written, commentary, the, tapestry, tells, the, story, of, the, events, of, 1064, 1066, culminating, in, the, battle, of, hastings, the, two, main, protagonists, are, harold, godwinson, recently, crowned, king, of, england, leading, the, anglo, saxon, english, and, william, duke, of, normandy, leading, a, mainly, norman, army, sometimes, called, the, companions, of, william, the, conqueror, william, was, the, illegitimate, son, of, robert, the, magnificent, duke, of, normandy, and, herleva, or, arlette, a, tanner, s, daughter, william, became, duke, of, normandy, at, the, age, of, seven, and, was, in, control, of, normandy, by, the, age, of, nineteen, his, half, brother, was, bishop, odo, of, bayeux, king, edward, the, confessor, king, of, england, and, about, sixty, years, old, at, the, time, the, tapestry, starts, its, narration, had, no, children, or, any, clear, successor, edward, s, mother, emma, of, normandy, was, william, s, great, aunt, at, that, time, succession, to, the, english, throne, was, not, by, primogeniture, but, was, decided, jointly, by, the, king, and, by, an, assembly, of, nobility, the, witenagemot, harold, godwinson, earl, of, wessex, and, the, most, powerful, noble, in, england, was, edward, s, brother, in, law, the, norman, chronicler, william, of, poitiers, reported, that, edward, had, previously, determined, that, william, would, succeed, him, on, the, throne, and, harold, had, sworn, to, honour, this, and, yet, later, that, harold, had, claimed, edward, on, his, deathbed, had, made, him, heir, over, william, however, other, sources, such, as, eadmer, dispute, this, claim, tapestry, fragments, have, been, found, in, scandinavia, dating, from, the, ninth, century, and, it, is, thought, that, norman, and, anglo, saxon, embroidery, developed, from, this, sort, of, work, examples, are, to, be, found, in, the, grave, goods, of, the, oseberg, ship, and, the, verhogdal, tapestries, a, monastic, text, from, ely, the, liber, eliensis, mentions, a, woven, narrative, wall, hanging, commemorating, the, deeds, of, byrhtnoth, killed, in, 991, wall, hangings, were, common, by, the, tenth, century, with, english, and, norman, texts, particularly, commending, the, skill, of, anglo, saxon, seamstresses, mural, paintings, imitating, draperies, still, exist, in, france, and, italy, and, there, are, twelfth, century, mentions, of, other, wall, hangings, in, normandy, and, france, a, poem, by, baldric, of, dol, might, even, describe, the, bayeux, tapestry, itself, the, bayeux, tapestry, was, therefore, not, unique, at, the, time, it, was, created, rather, it, is, remarkable, for, being, the, sole, surviving, example, of, medieval, narrative, needlework, very, few, hangings, from, the, 11th, century, survive, but, the, tapestry, of, creation, or, girona, tapestry, is, a, large, romanesque, panel, of, needlework, in, the, museum, of, girona, cathedral, catalonia, spain, the, hanging, depicts, a, series, of, figures, from, the, book, of, genesis, and, personifications, of, the, month, the, cloth, of, saint, gereon, in, germany, is, the, largest, of, a, group, of, fragments, from, hangings, based, on, decorative, byzantine, silks, including, animals, that, are, probably, the, earliest, european, survivals, the, tapestry, begins, with, a, panel, of, edward, the, confessor, sending, harold, to, normandy, scene, 1, later, norman, sources, say, that, the, mission, was, for, harold, to, pledge, loyalty, to, william, but, the, tapestry, does, not, suggest, any, specific, purpose, by, mischance, harold, arrives, at, the, wrong, location, in, france, and, is, taken, prisoner, by, guy, count, of, ponthieu, scene, 7, after, exchanges, of, messages, borne, by, mounted, messengers, harold, is, released, to, william, who, then, invites, harold, to, accompany, him, on, a, campaign, against, conan, ii, duke, of, brittany, on, the, way, just, outside, the, monastery, of, mont, saint, michel, the, army, becomes, mired, in, quicksand, and, harold, saves, two, norman, soldiers, scene, 17, william, s, army, chases, conan, from, dol, de, bretagne, to, rennes, and, conan, finally, surrenders, at, dinan, scene, 20, william, gives, harold, arms, and, armour, possibly, knighting, him, and, harold, takes, an, oath, on, saintly, relics, scene, 23, although, the, writing, on, the, tapestry, explicitly, states, an, oath, is, taken, there, is, no, clue, as, to, what, is, being, promised, harold, leaves, for, home, and, meets, again, with, the, old, king, edward, who, appears, to, be, remonstrating, with, him, scene, 25, harold, is, in, a, somewhat, submissive, posture, and, seems, to, be, in, disgrace, however, possibly, deliberately, the, king, s, intentions, are, not, made, clear, the, scene, then, shifts, by, about, one, year, to, when, edward, has, become, mortally, ill, and, the, tapestry, strongly, suggests, that, on, his, deathbed, he, bequeaths, the, crown, to, harold, what, is, probably, the, coronation, ceremony, is, attended, by, stigand, whose, position, as, archbishop, of, canterbury, was, controversial, scene, 31, stigand, is, performing, a, liturgical, function, possibly, not, the, crowning, itself, the, tapestry, labels, the, celebrant, as, stigant, archieps, stigand, the, archbishop, although, by, that, time, he, had, been, excommunicated, by, the, papacy, who, considered, his, appointment, unlawful, a, star, with, a, streaming, tail, now, known, to, be, halley, s, comet, then, appears, at, this, point, the, lower, border, of, the, tapestry, shows, a, fleet, of, ghost, like, ships, thus, hinting, at, a, future, invasion, scene, 33, the, news, of, harold, s, coronation, is, taken, to, normandy, whereupon, we, are, told, that, william, is, ordering, a, fleet, of, ships, to, be, built, although, it, is, bishop, odo, shown, issuing, the, instructions, scene, 35, the, invaders, reach, england, and, land, unopposed, william, orders, his, men, to, find, food, and, a, meal, is, cooked, scene, 43, a, house, is, burnt, by, two, soldiers, which, may, indicate, some, ravaging, of, the, local, countryside, on, the, part, of, the, invaders, and, underneath, on, a, smaller, scale, than, the, arsonists, a, woman, holds, her, boy, s, hand, as, she, asks, for, humanity, scene, 47, news, is, brought, to, william, the, normans, build, a, motte, and, bailey, at, hastings, to, defend, their, position, messengers, are, sent, between, the, two, armies, and, william, makes, a, speech, to, prepare, his, army, for, battle, scene, 51, the, battle, of, hastings, was, fought, on, 14, october, 1066, less, than, three, weeks, after, the, battle, of, stamford, bridge, but, the, tapestry, does, not, provide, this, context, the, english, fight, on, foot, behind, a, shield, wall, whilst, the, normans, are, on, horses, two, fallen, knights, are, named, as, leofwine, and, gyrth, harold, s, brothers, but, both, armies, are, shown, fighting, bravely, bishop, odo, brandishes, his, baton, or, mace, and, rallies, the, norman, troops, in, battle, scene, 54, to, reassure, his, knights, that, he, is, still, alive, and, well, william, raises, his, helmet, to, show, his, face, the, battle, becomes, very, bloody, with, troops, being, slaughtered, and, dismembered, corpses, littering, the, ground, king, harold, is, killed, scene, 57, this, scene, can, be, interpreted, in, different, ways, as, the, name, harold, appears, above, a, number, of, knights, making, it, difficult, to, identify, which, character, is, harold, since, one, character, appears, with, an, arrow, shot, in, his, head, under, the, name, harold, while, another, character, is, slain, by, a, sword, underneath, the, words, was, slain, the, final, remaining, scene, shows, unarmoured, english, troops, fleeing, the, battlefield, the, last, part, of, the, tapestry, is, missing, however, it, is, thought, that, the, story, contained, only, one, additional, scene, the, following, is, a, list, of, known, persons, depicted, on, the, bayeux, tapestry, tituli, are, included, in, many, scenes, to, point, out, names, of, people, and, places, or, to, explain, briefly, the, event, being, depicted, the, text, is, in, latin, but, at, times, the, style, of, words, and, spelling, shows, an, english, influence, a, dark, blue, wool, almost, black, is, mostly, used, but, towards, the, end, of, the, tapestry, other, colours, are, used, sometimes, for, each, word, and, other, times, for, each, letter, the, complete, text, and, english, translation, are, displayed, beside, images, of, each, scene, at, bayeux, tapestry, tituli, the, depiction, of, events, on, the, tapestry, has, raised, several, questions, which, remain, unsettled, the, identification, of, harold, ii, of, england, in, the, vignette, depicting, his, death, is, disputed, some, recent, historians, disagree, with, the, traditional, view, that, harold, is, the, figure, struck, in, the, eye, with, an, arrow, and, that, the, arrow, is, a, later, 18th, 19th, century, modification, following, a, period, of, repair, beno, t, s, engraving, of, 1729, and, bernard, de, montfaucon, s, engravings, of, the, tapestry, as, it, was, in, 1730, show, a, spear, or, lance, in, place, of, the, arrow, and, no, arrow, fletchings, further, needle, holes, in, the, linen, suggest, that, something, has, been, removed, or, shortened, and, fletchings, added, to, form, an, arrow, a, figure, is, slain, with, a, sword, in, the, subsequent, plate, and, the, phrase, above, the, figure, refers, to, harold, s, death, interfectus, est, he, is, slain, this, would, appear, to, be, more, consistent, with, the, labeling, used, elsewhere, in, the, work, it, was, common, medieval, iconography, that, a, perjurer, was, to, die, with, a, weapon, through, the, eye, therefore, the, tapestry, might, be, said, to, emphasize, william, s, rightful, claim, to, the, throne, by, depicting, harold, as, an, oath, breaker, whether, he, actually, died, in, this, way, remains, a, mystery, and, is, much, debated, there, is, a, panel, with, what, appears, to, be, a, clergyman, touching, or, possibly, striking, a, woman, s, face, no, one, knows, the, significance, of, this, scene, or, the, caption, above, it, ubi, unus, clericus, et, lfgyva, where, a, certain, cleric, and, lfgyva, where, lfgyva, is, the, latinised, spelling, of, lfgifu, a, popular, anglo, saxon, woman, s, name, literally, elf, gift, the, use, of, the, grapheme, shows, familiarity, with, english, spelling, there, are, two, naked, male, figures, in, the, border, below, this, figure, the, one, directly, below, the, figure, is, in, a, pose, mirroring, that, of, the, cleric, squatting, and, displaying, his, genitalia, a, scene, that, was, frequently, censored, in, historical, reproductions, however, similar, naked, figures, appear, elsewhere, in, the, lower, border, where, there, seems, to, be, no, connection, at, all, with, the, main, action, harold, had, a, younger, sister, named, lfgifu, her, name, is, spelt, alveva, in, the, domesday, book, of, 1086, who, was, possibly, promised, to, william, by, harold, or, even, betrothed, to, him, but, she, died, c, 1066, prior, to, the, invasion, lfgifu, was, also, the, name, of, the, mother, of, sweyn, knutsson, and, harold, harefoot, past, kings, of, denmark, and, england, respectively, via, cnut, the, great, it, has, been, speculated, that, this, scene, occurring, after, the, meeting, of, harold, and, william, is, to, remind, the, contemporary, viewers, of, a, scandal, that, occurred, between, lfgifu, of, northampton, and, emma, of, normandy, cnut, s, wives, that, eventually, led, to, the, crowning, of, edward, the, confessor, child, of, emma, and, her, first, husband, thelred, the, unready, at, least, two, panels, of, the, tapestry, are, missing, perhaps, even, another, 6, 4, m, 7, 0, yd, in, total, this, missing, area, may, have, depicted, william, s, coronation, as, king, of, england, a, poem, by, baldric, of, dol, describes, a, tapestry, on, the, walls, of, the, personal, apartments, of, adela, of, normandy, which, is, very, similar, to, the, bayeux, depiction, he, describes, the, closing, scene, as, the, coronation, of, william, in, london, the, bayeux, tapestry, was, probably, commissioned, by, the, house, of, normandy, and, essentially, depicts, a, norman, viewpoint, however, harold, is, shown, as, brave, and, his, soldiers, are, not, belittled, throughout, william, is, described, as, dux, duke, whereas, harold, also, called, dux, up, to, his, coronation, is, subsequently, called, rex, king, the, fact, that, the, narrative, extensively, covers, harold, s, activities, in, normandy, in, 1064, indicates, that, the, intention, was, to, show, a, strong, relationship, between, that, expedition, and, the, norman, conquest, starting, two, years, later, it, is, for, this, reason, that, the, tapestry, is, generally, seen, by, modern, scholars, as, an, apologia, for, the, norman, conquest, the, tapestry, s, narration, seems, to, place, stress, on, harold, s, oath, to, william, although, its, rationale, is, not, made, clear, norman, sources, claim, that, the, english, succession, was, being, pledged, to, william, but, english, sources, give, varied, accounts, today, it, is, thought, that, the, norman, sources, are, to, be, preferred, both, the, tapestry, and, norman, sources, name, stigand, the, excommunicated, archbishop, of, canterbury, as, the, man, who, crowned, harold, possibly, to, discredit, harold, s, kingship, one, english, source, suggests, that, he, was, crowned, by, ealdred, archbishop, of, york, and, favoured, by, the, papacy, making, harold, s, position, as, legitimate, king, more, secure, contemporary, scholarship, has, not, decided, the, matter, although, it, is, generally, thought, that, ealdred, performed, the, coronation, although, political, propaganda, or, personal, emphasis, may, have, somewhat, distorted, the, historical, accuracy, of, the, story, the, bayeux, tapestry, constitutes, a, visual, record, of, medieval, arms, apparel, and, other, objects, unlike, any, other, artifact, surviving, from, this, period, there, is, no, attempt, at, continuity, between, scenes, either, in, individuals, appearance, or, clothing, the, knights, carry, shields, but, show, no, system, of, hereditary, coats, of, arms, the, beginnings, of, modern, heraldic, structure, were, in, place, but, would, not, become, standard, until, the, middle, of, the, 12th, century, it, has, been, noted, that, the, warriors, are, depicted, fighting, with, bare, hands, while, other, sources, indicate, the, general, use, of, gloves, in, battle, and, hunt, the, american, historian, stephen, d, white, in, a, study, of, the, tapestry, has, cautioned, against, reading, it, as, an, english, or, norman, story, showing, how, the, animal, fables, visible, in, the, borders, may, instead, offer, a, commentary, on, the, dangers, of, conflict, and, the, futility, of, pursuing, power, a, number, of, replicas, of, the, bayeux, tapestry, have, been, created, in, various, media, other, modern, artists, have, attempted, to, complete, the, work, by, creating, panels, depicting, subsequent, events, up, to, william, s, coronation, though, the, actual, content, of, the, missing, panels, is, unknown, in, 1997, the, embroidery, artist, jan, messent, completed, a, reconstruction, showing, william, accepting, the, surrender, of, english, nobles, at, berkhamsted, beorcham, hertfordshire, and, his, coronation, in, early, 2013, 416, residents, of, alderney, in, the, channel, islands, finished, a, continuation, including, william, s, coronation, and, the, building, of, the, tower, of, london, because, it, resembles, a, modern, comic, strip, or, movie, storyboard, is, widely, recognised, and, is, so, distinctive, in, its, artistic, style, the, bayeux, tapestry, has, frequently, been, used, or, reimagined, in, a, variety, of, different, popular, culture, contexts, george, wingfield, digby, wrote, in, 1957, it, was, designed, to, tell, a, story, to, a, largely, illiterate, public, it, is, like, a, strip, cartoon, racy, emphatic, colourful, with, a, good, deal, of, blood, and, thunder, and, some, ribaldry, it, has, been, cited, by, scott, mccloud, in, understanding, comics, as, an, example, of, early, sequential, narrative, art, and, bryan, talbot, a, british, comic, book, artist, has, called, it, the, first, known, british, comic, strip, it, has, inspired, many, modern, political, and, other, cartoons, including, the, tapestry, has, inspired, modern, embroideries, most, notably, and, directly, other, embroideries, more, loosely, inspired, by, it, include, the, hastings, embroidery, 1966, the, new, world, tapestry, 1980, 2000, the, quaker,
