similar, to, the, 4, 000, year, old, pottery, tradition, of, kalpurgan, an, archaeological, site, near, the, village, usually, the, term, is, applied, to, traditional, techniques, of, creating, items, whether, for, personal, use, or, as, products, that, are, both, practical, and, aesthetic, handicraft, industries, are, those, that, produce, things, with, hands, to, meet, the, needs, of, the, people, in, their, locality, without, using, machines, collective, terms, for, handicrafts, include, artisanry, crafting, and, handcrafting, the, term, arts, and, crafts, is, also, applied, especially, in, the, united, states, and, mostly, to, hobbyists, and, children, s, output, rather, than, items, crafted, for, daily, use, but, this, distinction, is, not, formal, and, the, term, is, easily, confused, with, the, arts, and, crafts, design, movement, which, is, in, fact, as, practical, as, it, is, aesthetic, handicraft, has, its, roots, in, the, rural, crafts, the, material, goods, necessities, of, ancient, civilizations, and, many, specific, crafts, have, been, practiced, for, centuries, while, others, are, modern, inventions, or, popularizations, of, crafts, which, were, originally, practiced, in, a, limited, geographic, area, many, handcrafters, use, natural, even, entirely, indigenous, materials, while, others, may, prefer, modern, non, traditional, materials, and, even, upcycle, industrial, materials, the, individual, artisanship, of, a, handcrafted, item, is, the, paramount, criterion, those, made, by, mass, production, or, machines, are, not, handicraft, goods, seen, as, developing, the, skills, and, creative, interests, of, students, generally, and, sometimes, towards, a, particular, craft, or, trade, handicrafts, are, often, integrated, into, educational, systems, both, informally, and, formally, most, crafts, require, the, development, of, skill, and, the, application, of, patience, but, can, be, learned, by, virtually, anyone, like, folk, art, handicraft, output, often, has, cultural, and, or, religious, significance, and, increasingly, may, have, a, political, message, as, well, as, in, craftivism, many, crafts, become, very, popular, for, brief, periods, of, time, a, few, months, or, a, few, years, spreading, rapidly, among, the, crafting, population, as, everyone, emulates, the, first, examples, then, their, popularity, wanes, until, a, later, resurgence, the, arts, and, crafts, movement, originated, as, a, late, 19th, century, design, reform, and, social, movement, principally, in, europe, north, america, and, australia, and, continues, today, its, proponents, are, motivated, by, the, ideals, of, movement, founders, such, as, william, morris, and, john, ruskin, who, proposed, that, in, pre, industrial, societies, such, as, the, european, middle, ages, people, had, achieved, fulfillment, through, the, creative, process, of, handicrafts, this, was, held, up, in, contrast, to, what, was, perceived, to, be, the, alienating, effects, of, industrial, labor, these, activities, were, called, crafts, because, originally, many, of, them, were, professions, under, the, guild, system, adolescents, were, apprenticed, to, a, master, craftsman, and, refined, their, skills, over, a, period, of, years, in, exchange, for, low, wages, by, the, time, their, training, was, complete, they, were, well, equipped, to, set, up, in, trade, for, themselves, earning, their, living, with, the, skill, that, could, be, traded, directly, within, the, community, often, for, goods, and, services, the, industrial, revolution, and, the, increasing, mechanization, of, production, processes, gradually, reduced, or, eliminated, many, of, the, roles, professional, craftspeople, played, and, today, many, handicrafts, are, increasingly, seen, especially, when, no, longer, the, mainstay, of, a, formal, vocational, trade, as, a, form, of, hobby, folk, art, and, sometimes, fine, art, the, term, handicrafts, can, also, refer, to, the, products, themselves, of, such, artisanal, efforts, that, require, specialized, knowledge, maybe, highly, technical, in, their, execution, require, specialized, equipment, and, or, facilities, to, produce, involve, manual, labor, or, a, blue, collar, work, ethic, are, accessible, to, the, general, public, and, are, constructed, from, materials, with, histories, that, exceed, the, boundaries, of, western, fine, art, tradition, such, as, ceramics, glass, textiles, metal, and, wood, these, products, are, produced, within, a, specific, community, of, practice, and, while, they, mostly, differ, from, the, products, produced, within, the, communities, of, art, and, design, the, boundaries, often, overlap, resulting, in, hybrid, objects, additionally, as, the, interpretation, and, validation, of, art, is, frequently, a, matter, of, context, an, audience, may, perceive, handcrafted, objects, as, art, objects, when, these, objects, are, viewed, within, an, art, context, such, as, in, a, museum, or, in, a, position, of, prominence, in, one, s, home, simple, arts, and, crafts, projects, are, a, common, elementary, and, middle, school, activity, in, both, mainstream, and, alternative, education, systems, around, the, world, in, some, of, the, scandinavian, or, nordic, countries, more, advanced, handicrafts, form, part, of, the, formal, compulsory, school, curriculum, and, are, collectively, referred, to, as, sl, jd, in, swedish, and, k, sity, in, finnish, students, learn, how, to, work, mainly, with, metal, textile, and, wood, not, for, professional, training, purposes, as, in, american, vocational, technical, schools, but, with, the, aim, to, develop, children, s, and, teens, practical, skills, such, as, everyday, problem, solving, ability, tool, use, and, understanding, of, the, materials, that, surround, us, for, economical, cultural, and, environmental, purposes, secondary, schools, and, college, and, university, art, departments, increasingly, provide, elective, options, for, more, handicraft, based, arts, in, addition, to, formal, fine, arts, a, distinction, that, continues, to, fade, throughout, the, years, especially, with, the, rise, of, studio, craft, i, e, the, use, of, traditional, handicrafts, techniques, by, professional, fine, artists, many, community, centers, and, schools, run, evening, or, day, classes, and, workshops, for, adults, and, children, offering, to, teach, basic, craft, skills, in, a, short, period, of, time, handicraft, production, is, a, small, scale, production, of, products, using, manual, labor, it, was, especially, common, in, the, middle, ages, during, the, era, of, the, industrial, revolution, it, was, mainly, supplanted, by, mass, production, however, it, still, exists, for, the, production, of, goods, such, as, luxury, goods, the, handmade, effect, is, a, phenomenon, where, consumers, exhibit, a, preference, for, products, that, are, crafted, by, human, labor, rather, than, produced, through, automated, or, robotic, processes, this, preference, is, particularly, pronounced, for, products, with, higher, symbolic, value, where, expressing, one, s, beliefs, and, personality, holds, greater, significance, consumers, especially, in, contexts, emphasizing, symbolic, consumption, have, a, stronger, motivation, for, uniqueness, and, associate, human, labor, more, closely, with, product, uniqueness, in, product, categories, where, mechanical, production, is, common, consumers, are, more, attracted, to, products, labeled, as, handmade, the, positive, handmade, effect, on, product, attractiveness, is, driven, in, large, part, by, the, perception, that, handmade, products, symbolically, contain, love, the, handmade, effect, is, influenced, by, two, key, factors, firstly, consumers, express, stronger, intentions, to, purchase, handmade, products, when, buying, gifts, for, loved, ones, compared, to, more, distant, recipients, secondly, they, are, willing, to, pay, a, higher, price, for, handmade, gifts, when, the, purchase, is, motivated, by, the, desire, to, convey, love, rather, than, simply, acquiring, the, best, performing, product, the, handicraft, method, of, production, has, been, used, by, people, since, ancient, times, initially, people, engaged, in, handicraft, production, aimed, to, satisfy, the, needs, of, their, own, economy, however, with, the, development, of, commodity, money, relations, an, increasing, number, of, goods, produced, by, them, began, to, be, supplied, to, the, market, mostly, these, were, household, products, dishes, furniture, jewelry, souvenirs, clothes, shoes, however, over, time, other, goods, such, as, weapons, began, to, go, on, sale, in, pre, revolutionary, russia, handicraft, production, was, quite, widespread, about, 30, of, all, manufactured, products, were, produced, by, handicraft, methods, products, were, sold, at, fairs, and, barter, exchange, was, widespread, with, the, beginning, of, industrialisation, and, collectivization, of, the, soviet, union, the, handicraft, mode, of, production, was, declared, the, highest, degree, of, oppression, of, the, working, people, and, ceased, to, exist, in, almost, all, spheres, of, the, soviet, economy, except, on, an, informal, basis, some, state, economies, such, as, that, of, vietnam, are, largely, based, on, handicraft, production, for, example, in, the, 1950s, in, north, vietnam, there, were, more, than, 100, 000, handicraft, enterprises, in, the, early, 1970s, even, before, the, end, of, the, war, handicraft, production, provided, about, half, of, all, the, products, of, the, local, industry, and, almost, a, third, of, the, total, industrial, production, of, the, republic, by, 1977, after, the, reunification, of, vietnam, there, were, 700, 000, handicraftsmen, in, south, vietnam, handicraft, production, in, nepal, withstands, competition, with, industrial, production, and, foreign, goods, which, is, explained, not, only, by, economic, and, natural, geographical, factors, but, also, by, the, support, and, encouragement, of, the, handicraft, industry, from, the, state, there, are, almost, as, many, variations, on, the, theme, of, handicrafts, as, there, are, crafters, with, time, on, their, hands, but, they, can, be, broken, down, into, a, number, of, categories, handicrafts, are, often, made, for, home, use, and, decor, if, sold, they, are, sold, in, direct, sales, gift, shops, public, markets, and, online, shopping, in, developing, countries, handicrafts, are, sold, to, locals, and, as, souvenirs, to, tourists, sellers, tend, to, speak, at, least, a, few, words, of, common, tourist, languages, there, are, also, specialty, markets, such, as, according, to, the, vietnam, handicrafts, export, association, vietcraft, vietnam, s, handicrafts, export, turnover, in, 2023, reached, us, 2, 2, billion, up, 10, 5, over, 2022, the, united, states, is, vietnam, s, largest, export, market, accounting, for, 35, of, total, export, turnover, vietnam, s, handicrafts, industry, currently, has, about, 600, villages, with, over, 10, million, direct, workers, wickerwork, is, a, traditional, handicraft, industry, based, on, the, use, of, two, basic, materials, bamboo, and, rattan, vietnam, currently, has, 893, villages, specializing, in, wickerwork, accounting, for, 24, of, the, total, number, of, villages, including, 647, bamboo, and, rattan, villages, and, 246, straw, and, water, hyacinth, villages
