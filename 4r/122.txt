the, tribe, of, muhammad, as, islam, spread, the, quran, had, the, effect, of, unifying, and, standardizing, arabic, not, only, is, the, qur, an, the, first, work, of, any, significant, length, written, in, the, language, but, it, also, has, a, far, more, complicated, structure, than, the, earlier, literary, works, with, its, 114, surah, chapters, which, contain, 6, 236, ayat, verses, it,

the, hijra, deal, primarily, with, sharia, and, prescriptions, of, islamic, life, the, word, qur, an, comes, from, the, arabic, root, qara, a, meaning, he, read, or, he, recited, in, early, times,

masahif, or, copies, of, the, qur, an, under, uthman, 576, 656, although, it, contains, elements, of, both, prose, and, poetry, and, therefore, is, closest, to, saj, or, rhymed, prose, the, qur, an, is, regarded, as, entirely, apart, from, these, classifications, the, text, is, believed, to, be, divine, revelation, and, is, seen, by, muslims, as, being, eternal, or, uncreated, this, leads, to, the, doctrine, of, i, jaz, or, inimitability, of, the, qur, an, which, implies, that, nobody, can, copy, the, work, s, style, or, do, they, say, he, has, fabricated, this, quran, say, o, prophet, produce, ten, fabricated, s, rahs, like, it, and, seek, help, from, whoever, you, can, other, than, allah, if, what, you, say, is, true, and, if, you, are, in, doubt, about, what, we, have, revealed, to, our, servant, then, produce, a, s, rah, like, it, and, call, your, helpers, other, than, allah, if, what, you, say, is, true, but, if, you, do, not, and, you, will, never, be, able, to, then,

not, produce, the, like, of, it, even, if, they, were, to, each, other, assistants, this, doctrine, of, i, jaz, possibly, had, a, slight, limiting, effect, on, arabic, literature, proscribing, exactly, what, could, be, written, whilst, islam, allows, muslims, to, write, read, and, recite, poetry, the, qur, an, states, in, the, 26th, sura, ash, shu, ara, or, the, poets, that, poetry, which, is, blasphemous, obscene, praiseworthy, of, sinful, acts, or, attempts, to, challenge, the, qu, ran, s, content, and, form, is, forbidden, for, muslims, and, as, to, the, poets, those, who, go, astray, follow, them, do, you, not, see, that, they, wander, about, bewildered, in, every, valley, and, that, they, say, that, which, they, do, not, do, except, those, who, believe, and, do, good, works, and, remember, allah, much, and, defend, themselves, after, they, are, oppressed, and, they, who, act, unjustly, shall, know, to, what, final, place, of, turning, they, shall, turn, back, this,

prose, poetry, of, which, the, first, examples, in, modern, arabic, literature, are, to, be, found, in, the, writings, of, francis, marrash, and, of, which, two, of, the, most, influential, proponents, were, nazik, al, malaika, and, iman, mersal, the, development, of, modernist, poetry, also, influenced, poetry, in, arabic, more, recently, poets, such, as, adunis, have, pushed, the, boundaries, of, stylistic, experimentation, even, further, an, example, of, modern, poetry, in, classical, arabic, style, with, themes, of, pan, arabism, is, the, work, of, aziz, pasha, abaza, he, came, from, abaza, family, which, produced, notable, arabic, literary, figures, including, ismail, pasha, abaza, fekry, pasha, abaza, novelist, tharwat, abaza, and, desouky, bek, abaza, among, others,

syrian, poet, nizar, qabbani, addressed, less, political, themes, but, was, regarded, as, a, cultural, icon, and, his, poems, provide, the, lyrics, for, many, popular, songs, two, distinct, trends, can, be, found, in, the, nahda, period, of, revival, the, first, was, a, neo, classical, movement, which, sought, to, rediscover, the, literary, traditions, of, the, past, and, was, influenced, by, traditional, literary, genres, such, as, the, maqama, and, works, like, one, thousand, and, one, nights, in, contrast, a, modernist, movement, began, by, translating, western, modernist, works, primarily, novels, into, arabic, in, the, 19th, century, individual, authors, in, syria, lebanon, and, egypt, created, original, works, by, imitating, classical, narrative, genres, ahmad, faris,

1899, was, also, influential, according, to, the, authors, of, the, encyclopedia, of, the, novel, almost, each, of, the, above, have, been, claimed, as, the, first, arabic, novel, which, goes, to, suggest, that, the, arabic, novel, emerged, from, several, rehearsals, and, multiple, beginnings, rather, than, from, one, single, origin, given, that, the, very, arabic, word, riwaya, which, is, now, used, exclusively, in, reference, to, the, novel, has, traditionally, conjured, up, a, tangle, of, narrative, genres, it, might, not, be, unfair, to, contend, that, the, arabic, novel, owes, its, early, formation, not, only, to, the, appropriation, of, the, novel, genre, from, europe, but, also, and, more, importantly, to, the, revival, and, transformation, of, traditional, narrative, genres, in, the, wake, of, napoleon, s, 1798, expedition, into, egypt, and, the, arab, world, s, firsthand, encounter, with, industrialized, imperial, europe, a, common, theme, in, the, modern, arabic, novel, is, the, study, of, family, life, with, obvious, resonances, of, the, wider, family, of, the, arabic, world, many, of, the, novels, have, been, unable, to, avoid, the, politics, and, conflicts, of, the, region, with, war, often, acting, as, background, to, intimate, family, dramas, the, works, of, naguib, mahfuz, depict, life, in, cairo, and, his, cairo, trilogy, describing, the, struggles, of, a, modern, cairene, family, across, three, generations, won, him, a, nobel, prize, for, literature, in, 1988, he, was, the, first, arabic, writer, to, win, the, prize, the, musical, plays, of, lebanese, maroun, naccache, from, the, mid, 1800s, are, considered, the, birth, of, not, only, theatre, in, lebanon, but, also, modern, arab, theatre, modern, arabic, drama, began, to, be, written, in, the, 19th, century, chiefly, in, egypt, and, mainly, influenced, and, in, imitation, of, french, works, it, was, not, until, the, 20th, century, that, it, began, to, develop, a, distinctly, arab, flavour, and, be, seen, elsewhere, the, most, important, arab, playwright, was, tawfiq, al, hakim, whose, first, play, was, a, re, telling, of, the, qur, anic, story, of, the, seven, sleepers, and, the, second, an, epilogue, for, the, thousand, and, one, nights, other, important, dramatists, of, the, region, include, yusuf, al, ani, from, iraq, and, saadallah, wannous, from, syria, features,

snippets, of, poetry, or, is, in, the, form, of, saj, or, rhymed, prose, the, themes, of, the, poetry, range, from, high, flown, hymns, of, praise, to, bitter, personal, attacks, and, from, religious, and, mystical, ideas, to, poems, on, women, and, wine, an, important, feature, of, the, poetry, which, would, be, applied, to, all, of, the, literature, was, the, idea, that, it, must, be, pleasing, to, the, ear, the, poetry, and, much, of, the, prose, was, written, with, the, design, that, it, would, be, spoken, aloud, and, great, care, was, taken, to, make, all, writing, as, mellifluous, as, possible, the, research, into, the, life, and, times, of, muhammad, and, determining, the, genuine, parts, of, the, sunnah, was, an, important, early, reason, for, scholarship, in, or, about, the, arabic, language, it, was, also, the, reason, for, the, collecting, of, pre, islamic, poetry, as, some, of, these, poets, were, close, to, the, prophet, labid, meeting, muhammad, and, converting, to, islam, and, their, writings, illuminated, the, times, when, these, events, occurred, muhammad, also, inspired, the, first, arabic, biographies, known, as, a, l, sirah, al, nabawiyyah, the, earliest, was, by, wahb, ibn, munabbih, but, muhammad, ibn, ishaq, wrote, the, best, known, whilst, covering, the, life, of, the, prophet, they, also, told, of, the, battles, and, events, of, early, islam, and, have, numerous, digressions, on, older, biblical, traditions, some, of, the, earliest, works, studying, the, arabic, language, were, started, in, the, name, of, islam, tradition, has, it, that, the, caliph, ali, after, reading, a, copy, of, the, qur, an, with, errors, in, it, asked, abu, al, aswad, al, du, ali, to, write, a, work, codifying, arabic, grammar, khalil, ibn, ahmad, would, later, write, kitab, al, ayn, the, first, dictionary, of, arabic, along, with, works, on, prosody, and, music, and, his, pupil, sibawayh, would, produce, the, most, respected, work, of, arabic, grammar, known, simply, as, al, kitab, or, the, book, other, caliphs, followed, after, abd, al, malik, made, arabic, the, official, language, for, the, administration, of, the, new, empire, such, as, al, ma, mun, who, set, up, the, bayt, al, hikma, in, baghdad, for, research, and, translations, basrah, and, kufah, were, two, other, important, seats, of, learning, in, the, early, arab, world, between, which, there, was, a, strong, rivalry, the, institutions, set, up, mainly, to, investigate, more, fully, the, islamic, religion, were, invaluable, in, studying, many, other, subjects, caliph, hisham,

the, panchatantra, these, translations, would, keep, alive, scholarship, and, learning, particularly, that, of, ancient, greece, during, the, dark, ages, in, europe, and, the, works, would, often, be, first, re, introduced, to, europe, from, the, arabic, versions, more, medieval, cookbooks, have, survived, into, the, present, day, written, in, arabic, than, in, any, other, language, classical, arabic, culinary, literature, is, comprised, not, only, of, cookbooks, there, are, also, many, works, of, scholarship, and, descriptions, of, contemporary, foods, can, be, found, in, fictional, and,

overview, of, the, state, of, the, literature, at, that, time, one, of, the, most, common, forms, of, literature, during, the, abbasid, period, was, the, compilation, these, were, collections, of, facts, ideas, instructive, stories, and, poems, on, a, single, topic, and, covers, subjects, as, diverse, as, house, and, garden, women, gate, crashers, blind, people, envy, animals, and, misers, these, last, three, compilations, were, written, by, al, jahiz, the, acknowledged, master, of, the, form, these, collections, were, important, for, any, nadim, a, companion, to, a, ruler, or, noble, whose, role, was, often, involved, regaling, the, ruler, with, stories, and, information, to, entertain, or, advise, a, type, of, work, closely, allied, to, the, collection, was, the, manual, in, which, writers, like, ibn, qutaybah, offered, instruction, in, subjects, like, etiquette, how, to, rule, how, to, be, a, bureaucrat, and, even, how, to, write, ibn, qutaybah, also, wrote, one, of, the, earliest, histories, of, the, arabs, drawing, together, biblical, stories, arabic, folk, tales, and, more, historical, events, the, subject, of, sex, was, frequently, investigated, in, arabic, literature, the, ghazal, or, love, poem, had, a, long, history, being, at, times, tender, and, chaste, and, at, other, times, rather, explicit, in, the, sufi, tradition, the, love, poem, would, take, on, wider, mystical, and, religious, importance, sex, manuals, were, also, written, such, as, the, perfumed, garden, awq, al, am, mah, or, the, dove, s, neckring, by, ibn, hazm, and, nuzhat, al, albab, fi, ma, la, yujad, fi, kitab, or, delight, of, hearts, concerning, what, will, never, be, found, in, a, book, by, ahmad, al, tifashi, countering, such, works, are, one, like, rawdat, al,

aside, from, the, early, biographies, of, muhammad, the, first, major, biographer, to, weigh, character, rather, than, just, producing, a, hymn, of, praise, was, al, baladhuri, with, his, kitab, ansab, al, ashraf, or, book, of, the, genealogies, of, the, noble, a, collection, of, biographies, another, important, biographical, dictionary, was, begun, by, ibn, khallikan, and, expanded, by, al, safadi, and, one, of, the, first, significant, autobiographies, was, kitab, al, i, tibar, which, told, of, usamah, ibn, munqidh, and, his, experiences, in, fighting, in, the, crusades, this, time, period, saw, the, emergence, of, the, genre, of, tabaqat, biographical, dictionaries, or, biographical, compendia, ibn, khurdadhbih, an, official, in, the, postal, service, wrote, one, of, the, first, travel, books, and, the, form, remained, a, popular, one, in, arabic, literature, with, books, by, ibn, hawqal, ibn, fadlan, al, istakhri, al, muqaddasi, al, idrisi, and, most, famously, the, travels, of, ibn, battutah, these, give, a, view, of, the, many, cultures, of, the, wider, islamic, world, and, also, offer, muslim, perspectives, on, the, non, muslim, peoples, on, the, edges, of, the, empire, they, also, indicated, just, how, great, a, trading, power, the, muslim, peoples, had, become, these, were, often, sprawling, accounts, that, included, details, of, both, geography, and, history, some, writers, concentrated, solely, on, history, like, al, ya, qubi, and, al, tabari, whilst, others, focused, on, a, small, portion, of, history, such, as, ibn, al, azraq, with, a, history, of, mecca, and, ibn, abi, tahir, tayfur, writing, a, history, of, baghdad, the, historian, regarded, as, the, greatest, of, all, arabic, historians, though, is, ibn, khaldun, whose, history, muqaddimah, focuses, on, society, and, is, a, founding, text, in, sociology, and, economics, in, the, medieval, near, east, arabic, diaries, were, first, being, written, from, before, the, 10th, century, though, the, medieval, diary, which, most, resembles, the, modern, diary, was, that, of, abu, ali, ibn, al, banna, in, the, 11th, century, his, diary, was, the, earliest, to, be, arranged, in, order, of, date, ta, rikh, in, arabic, very, much, like, modern, diaries, literary, criticism, in, arabic, literature, often, focused, on, religious, texts, and, the, several, long, religious, traditions, of, hermeneutics, and, textual, exegesis, have, had, a, profound, influence, on, the, study, of, secular, texts, this, was, particularly, the, case, for, the, literary, traditions, of, islamic, literature, literary, criticism, was, also, employed, in, other, forms, of, medieval, arabic, poetry, and, literature, from, the, 9th, century, notably, by, al, jahiz, in, his, al, bayan, wa, l, tabyin, and, al, hayawan, and, by, abdullah, ibn, al, mu, tazz, in, his, kitab, al, badi, ibn, abd, rabbih, s, book, al, iqd, al, far, d, is, considered, one, of, the, seminal, texts, of, arabic, fiction, in, the, arab, world, there, was, a, great, distinction, between, al, fus, ha, quality, language, and, al, ammiyyah, language, of, the, common, people, not, many, writers, would, write, works, in, this, al, ammiyyah, or, common, language, and, it, was, felt, that, literature, had, to, be, improving, educational, and, with, purpose, rather, than, just, entertainment, this, did, not, stop, the, common, role, of, the, hakawati, or, story, teller, who, would, retell, the, entertaining, parts, of, more, educational, works, or, one, of, the, many, arabic, fables, or, folk, tales, which, were, often, not, written, down, in, many, cases, nevertheless, some, of, the, earliest, novels, including, the, first, philosophical, novels, were, written, by, arabic, authors, the, most, famous, example, of, arabic, fiction, is, the, one, thousand, and, one, nights, arabian, nights, it, is, easily, the, best, known, work, of, all, arabic, literature, and, still, affects, many, of, the, ideas, non, arabs, have, about, arabic, culture, a, good, example, of, the, lack, of, popular, arabic, prose, fiction, is, that, the, stories, of, aladdin, and, ali, baba, usually, regarded, as, part, of, the, tales, from, one, thousand, and, one, nights, were, not, actually, part, of, the, tales, they, were, first, included, in, french, translation, of, the, tales, by, antoine, galland, who, heard, them, being, told, by, maronite, hanna, dyab, and, only, existed, in, incomplete, arabic, manuscripts, before, that, the, other, great, character, from, arabic, literature, sinbad, is, from, the, tales, the, one, thousand, and, one, nights, is, usually, placed, in, the, genre, of, arabic, epic, literature, along, with, several, other, works, they, are, usually, collections, of, short, stories, or, episodes, strung, together, into, a, long, tale, the, extant, versions, were, mostly, written, down, relatively, late, after, the, 14th, century, although, many, were, undoubtedly, collected, earlier, and, many, of, the, original, stories, are, probably, pre, islamic, types, of, stories, in, these, collections, include, animal, fables, proverbs, stories, of, jihad, or, propagation, of, the, faith, humorous, tales, moral, tales, tales, about, the, wily, con, man, ali, zaybaq, and, tales, about, the, prankster, juha, maqama, not, only, straddles, the, divide, between, prose, and, poetry, being, instead, a, form, of, rhymed, prose, it, is, also, part, way, between, fiction, and, non, fiction, over, a, series, of, short, narratives, which, are, fictionalised, versions, of, real, life, situations, different, ideas, are, contemplated, a, good, example, of, this, is, a, maqama, on, musk, which, purports, to, compare, the, feature, of, different, perfumes, but, is, in, fact, a, work, of, political, satire, comparing, several, competing, rulers, maqama, also, makes, use, of, the, doctrine, of, badi, or, deliberately, adding, complexity, to, display, the, writer, s, dexterity, with, language, al, hamadhani, is, regarded, as, the, originator, of, maqama, his, work, was, taken, up, by, abu, muhammad, al, qasim, al, hariri, one, of, al, hariri, s, maqama, being, a, study, of, al, hamadhani, s, own, work, maqama, was, an, exceptionally, popular, form, of, arabic, literature, one, of, the, few, forms, which, continued, to, be, written, during, the, decline, of, arabic, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, a, famous, example, of, romantic, arabic, poetry, is, layla, and, majnun, dating, back, to, the, umayyad, era, in, the, 7th, century, it, is, a, tragic, story, of, undying, love, layla, and, majnun, is, considered, part, of, the, platonic, love, arabic, genre, so, called, because, the, couple, never, marry, or, consummate, their, relationship, that, is, prominent, in, arabic, literature, though, the, literary, motif, is, found, throughout, the, world, other, famous, virgin, love, stories, include, qays, and, lubna, kuthair, and, azza, marwa, and, al, majnun, al, faransi, and, antara, and, abla, the, 10th, century, encyclopedia, of, the, brethren, of, purity, features, a, fictional, anecdote, of, a, prince, who, strays, from, his, palace, during, his, wedding, feast, and, drunk, spends, the, night, in, a, cemetery, confusing, a, corpse, with, his, bride, the, story, is, used, as, a, gnostic, parable, of, the, soul, s, pre, existence, and, return, from, its, terrestrial, sojourn, another, medieval, arabic, love, story, was, hadith, bayad, wa, riyad, the, story, of, bayad, and, riyad, a, 13th, century, arabic, love, story, the, main, characters, of, the, tale, are, bayad, a, merchant, s, son, and, a, foreigner, from, damascus, and, riyad, a, well, educated, girl, in, the, court, of, an, unnamed, hajib, vizier, or, minister, of, iraq, which, is, referred, to, as, the, lady, the, hadith, bayad, wa, riyad, manuscript, is, believed, to, be, the, only, illustrated, manuscript, known, to, have, survived, from, more, than, eight, centuries, of, muslim, and, arab, presence, in, spain, many, of, the, tales, in, the, one, thousand, and, one, nights, are, also, love, stories, or, involve, romantic, love, as, a, central, theme, this, includes, the, frame, story, of, scheherazade, herself, and, many, of, the, stories, she, narrates, including, aladdin, the, ebony, horse, the, three, apples, tale, of, t, j, al, mul, k, and, the, princess, duny, the, lover, and, the, loved, adi, bin, zayd, and, the, princess, hind, di, ibil, al, khuza, i, with, the, lady, and, muslim, bin, al, walid, the, three, unfortunate, lovers, and, others, several, elements, of, courtly, love, were, developed, in, arabic, literature, namely, the, notions, of, love, for, love, s, sake, and, exaltation, of, the, beloved, lady, which, have, been, traced, back, to, arabic, literature, of, the, 9th, and, 10th, centuries, the, notion, of, the, ennobling, power, of, love, was, developed, in, the, early, 11th, century, by, the, persian, psychologist, and, philosopher, ibn, sina, known, as, avicenna, in, europe, in, his, arabic, treatise, risala, fi, l, ishq, a, treatise, on, love, the, final, element, of, courtly, love, the, concept, of, love, as, desire, never, to, be, fulfilled, was, also, at, times, implicit, in, arabic, poetry, the, earliest, known, example, of, a, whodunit, murder, mystery, was, the, three, apples, one, of, the, tales, narrated, by, scheherazade, in, the, one, thousand, and, one, nights, arabian, nights, in, this, tale, a, fisherman, discovers, a, heavy, locked, chest, along, the, tigris, river, and, he, sells, it, to, the, abbasid, caliph, harun, al, rashid, who, then, has, the, chest, broken, open, only, to, find, inside, it, the, dead, body, of, a, young, woman, who, was, cut, into, pieces, harun, orders, his, vizier, ja, far, ibn, yahya, to, solve, the, crime, and, find, the, murderer, within, three, days, or, be, executed, if, he, fails, his, assignment, suspense, is, generated, through, multiple, plot, twists, that, occur, as, the, story, progresses, this, may, thus, be, considered, an, archetype, for, detective, fiction, in, arabic, poetry, the, genre, of, satirical, poetry, was, known, as, hija, satire, was, introduced, into, prose, literature, by, the, author, al, jahiz, in, the, 9th, century, while, dealing, with, serious, topics, in, what, are, now, known, as, anthropology, sociology, and, psychology, he, introduced, a, satirical, approach, based, on, the, premise, that, however, serious, the, subject, under, review, it, could, be, made, more, interesting, and, thus, achieve, greater, effect, if, only, one, leavened, the, lump, of, solemnity, by, the, insertion, of, a, few, amusing, anecdotes, or, by, the, throwing, out, of, some, witty, or, paradoxical, observations, he, was, well, aware, that, in, treating, of, new, themes, in, his, prose, works, he, would, have, to, employ, a, vocabulary, of, a, nature, more, familiar, in, hija, satirical, poetry, for, example, in, one, of, his, zoological, works, he, satirized, the, preference, for, longer, human, penis, size, writing, if, the, length, of, the, penis, were, a, sign, of, honor, then, the, mule, would, belong, to, the, honorable, tribe, of, quraysh, another, satirical, story, based, on, this, preference, was, an, arabian, nights, tale, called, ali, with, the, large, member, in, the, 10th, century, the, writer, tha, alibi, recorded, satirical, poetry, written, by, the, poets, as, salami, and, abu, dulaf, with, as, salami, praising, abu, dulaf, s, wide, breadth,

upon, by, arabic, writers, and, islamic, philosophers, such, as, abu, bischr, his, pupil, al, farabi, avicenna, and, averroes, due, to, cultural, differences, they, disassociated, comedy, from, greek, dramatic, representation, and, instead, identified, it, with, arabic, poetic, themes, and, forms, such, as, hija, satirical, poetry, they, viewed, comedy, as, simply, the, art, of, reprehension, and, made, no, reference, to, light, and, cheerful, events, or, troublous, beginnings, and, happy, endings, associated, with, classical, greek, comedy, after, the, latin, translations, of, the, 12th, century, the, term, comedy, thus, gained, a, new, semantic, meaning, in, medieval, literature, while, puppet, theatre, and, passion, plays, were, popular, in, the, medieval, islamic, world, live, theatre, and, drama, has, only, been, a, visible, part, of, arabic, literature, in, the, modern, era, there, may, have, been, a, much, longer, theatrical, tradition, but, it, was, probably, not, regarded, as, legitimate, literature, and, mostly, went, unrecorded, there, is, an, ancient, tradition, of, public, performance, amongst, shi, i, muslims, of, a, play, depicting, the, life, and, death, of, al, husayn, at, the, battle, of, karbala, in, 680, ce, there, are, also, several, plays, composed, by, shams, al, din, muhammad, ibn, daniyal, in, the, 13th, century, when, he, mentions,

their, works, featured, moorish, characters, such, as, peele, s, the, battle, of, alcazar, and, shakespeare, s, the, merchant, of, venice, titus, andronicus, and, othello, which, featured, a, moorish, othello, as, its, title, character, these, works, are, said, to, have, been, inspired, by, several, moorish, delegations, from, morocco, to, elizabethan, england, at, the, beginning, of, the, 17th, century, ignoring, the, fact, that, the, merchant, of, venice, and, titus, andronicus, were, both, penned, in, the, 16th, century, in, 2016, opera, singer, and, actor, david, serero, performed, othello, in, a, moroccan, adaptation, in, new, york, the, arab, islamic, philosophers, ibn, tufail, abubacer, and, ibn, al, nafis, were, pioneers, of, the, philosophical, novel, as, they, wrote, the, earliest, novels, dealing, with, philosophical, fiction, ibn, tufail, wrote, the, first, arabic, novel, hayy, ibn, yaqdhan, philosophus, autodidactus, as, a, response, to, al, ghazali, s, the, incoherence, of, the, philosophers, this, was, followed, by, ibn, al, nafis, who, wrote, a, fictional, narrative, theologus, autodidactus, as, a, response, to, ibn, tufail, s, philosophus, autodidactus, both, of, these, narratives, had, protagonists, hayy, in, philosophus, autodidactus, and, kamil, in, theologus, autodidactus, who, were, autodidactic, individuals, spontaneously, generated, in, a, cave, and, living, in, seclusion, on, a, desert, island, both, being, the, earliest, examples, of, a, desert, island, story, however, while, hayy, lives, alone, on, the, desert, island, for, most, of, the, story, in, philosophus, autodidactus, until, he, meets, a, castaway, named, absal, the, story, of, kamil, extends, beyond, the, desert, island, setting, in, theologus, autodidactus, when, castaways, take, him, back, to, civilization, with, them, developing, into, the, earliest, known, coming, of, age, plot, and, eventually, becoming, the, first, example, of, a, science, fiction, novel, ibn, al, nafis, described, his, book, theologus, autodidactus, as, a, defense, of, the, system, of, islam, and, the, muslims, doctrines, on, the, missions, of, prophets, the, religious, laws, the, resurrection, of, the, body, and, the, transitoriness, of, the, world, he, presents, rational, arguments, for, bodily, resurrection, and, the, immortality, of, the, human, soul, using, both, demonstrative, reasoning, and, material, from, the, hadith, corpus, to, prove, his, case, later, islamic, scholars, viewed, this, work, as, a, response, to, the, metaphysical, claim, of, avicenna, and, ibn, tufail, that, bodily, resurrection, cannot, be, proven, through, reason, a, view, that, was, earlier, criticized, by, al, ghazali, ibn, al, nafis, work, was, later, translated, into, latin, and, english, as, theologus, autodidactus, in, the, early, 20th, century, a, latin, translation, of, ibn, tufail, s, work, entitled, philosophus, autodidactus, first, appeared, in, 1671,

these, translations, later, inspired, daniel, defoe, to, write, robinson, crusoe, which, also, featured, a, desert, island, narrative, and, was, regarded, as, the, first, novel, in, english, philosophus, autodidactus, also, inspired, robert, boyle, an, acquaintance, of, pococke, to, write, his, own, philosophical, novel, set, on, an, island, the, aspiring, naturalist, in, the, late, 17th, century, the, story, also, anticipated, rousseau, s, mile, in, some, ways, and, is, also, similar, to, the, later, story, of, mowgli, in, rudyard, kipling, s, the, jungle, book, as, well, the,

transliteration, of, the, greek, name, meaning, self, taught, theologian, written, by, the, arab, polymath, ibn, al, nafis, 1213, 1288, is, the, earliest, known, science, fiction, novel, while, also, being, an, early, desert, island, story, and, coming, of, age, story, the, novel, deals, with, various, science, fiction, elements, such, as, spontaneous, generation, futurology, apocalyptic, themes, the, end, of, the, world, and, doomsday, resurrection, and, the, afterlife, rather, than, giving, supernatural, or, mythological, explanations, for, these, events, ibn, al, nafis, attempted, to, explain, these, plot, elements, using, his, own, extensive, scientific, knowledge, in, anatomy, biology, physiology, astronomy, cosmology, and, geology, his, main, purpose, behind, this, science, fiction, work, was, to, explain, islamic, religious, teachings, in, terms, of, science, and, philosophy, for, example, it, was, through, this, novel, that, ibn, al, nafis, introduces, his, scientific, theory, of, metabolism, and, he, makes, references, to, his, own, scientific, discovery, of, the, pulmonary, circulation, in, order, to, explain, bodily, resurrection, the, novel, was, later,
