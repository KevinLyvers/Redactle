the, song, of, roland, french, la, chanson, de, roland, is, an, 11th, century, chanson, de, geste, based, on, the, deeds, of, the, frankish, military, leader, roland, at, the, battle, of, roncevaux, pass, in, ad, 778, during, the, reign, of, the, emperor, charlemagne, it, is, the, oldest, surviving, major, work, of, french, literature, it, exists, in, various, manuscript, versions, which, testify, to, its, enormous, and, enduring, popularity, in, medieval, and, renaissance, literature, from, the, 12th, to, 16th, centuries, the, epic, poem, written, in, old, french, is, the, first, and, one, of, the, most, outstanding, examples, of, the, chanson, de, geste, a, literary, form, that, flourished, between, the, 11th, and, 16th, centuries, in, medieval, europe, and, celebrated, legendary, deeds, an, early, version, was, composed, around, 1040, ad, with, additions, and, alterations, made, up, to, about, 1115, ad, the, final, poem, contains, about, 4, 000, lines, although, set, in, the, carolingian, era, the, song, of, roland, was, written, centuries, later, there, is, a, single, extant, manuscript, of, the, song, of, roland, in, old, french, held, at, the, bodleian, library, at, oxford, it, dates, between, 1129, and, 1165, and, was, written, in, anglo, norman, there, are, eight, additional, manuscripts, and, three, fragments, of, other, poems, on, the, subject, of, roland, scholars, estimate, that, the, poem, was, written, between, approximately, 1040, and, 1115, possibly, by, a, poet, named, turold, turoldus, in, the, manuscript, itself, and, that, most, of, the, alterations, were, completed, by, about, 1098, some, favor, the, earlier, dating, which, allows, that, the, narrative, was, inspired, by, the, castilian, campaigns, of, the, 1030s, and, that, the, poem, was, established, early, enough, to, be, a, major, influence, in, the, first, crusade, 1096, 1099, others, favor, a, later, dating, based, on, brief, passages, which, are, interpreted, as, alluding, to, events, of, the, first, crusade, relevant, to, the, question, of, dating, the, poem, the, term, d, oltre, mer, or, l, oltremarin, occurs, three, times, in, the, text, in, reference, to, named, muslims, who, came, to, fight, in, spain, and, france, the, old, french, oltre, mer, oversea, modern, french, outremer, was, commonly, used, during, and, after, the, first, crusade, to, refer, to, the, latin, levant, which, supports, a, date, of, composition, after, the, crusade, those, favoring, an, earlier, dating, argue, that, the, term, is, used, generically, to, refer, to, a, muslim, land, it, is, possible, that, the, bulk, of, the, poem, dates, from, before, the, crusades, with, a, few, additions, from, the, time, of, the, first, crusade, after, two, manuscripts, were, found, in, 1832, and, 1835, and, published, in, 1837, the, song, of, roland, became, recognized, as, france, s, national, epic, scholarly, consensus, has, long, accepted, that, the, song, of, roland, was, at, first, performed, orally, in, many, different, versions, with, varying, material, and, episodes, which, were, fixed, and, harmonized, in, the, textual, form, early, 19th, century, editors, of, the, song, of, roland, informed, in, part, by, patriotic, desires, to, elevate, a, distinctly, french, epic, could, thus, overstate, the, textual, cohesiveness, of, the, roland, tradition, as, they, presented, it, to, the, public, andrew, taylor, notes, he, roland, song, was, if, not, invented, at, the, very, least, constructed, by, supplying, it, with, an, appropriate, epic, title, isolating, it, from, its, original, codicological, context, and, providing, a, general, history, of, minstrel, performance, in, which, its, pure, origin, could, be, located, the, early, editors, presented, a, 4, 002, line, poem, as, sung, french, epic, certain, lines, of, the, oxford, manuscript, end, with, the, letters, aoi, the, meaning, of, this, word, or, annotation, is, unclear, many, scholars, have, hypothesized, that, the, marking, may, have, played, a, role, in, public, performances, of, the, text, such, as, indicating, a, place, where, a, jongleur, would, change, the, tempo, contrarily, nathan, love, believes, that, aoi, marks, locations, where, the, scribe, or, copyist, is, signaling, that, he, has, deviated, from, the, primary, manuscript, ergo, the, mark, indicates, the, source, is, a, non, performance, manuscript, the, song, of, roland, s, account, of, the, battle, of, roncesvalles, is, not, supported, by, history, according, to, einhard, s, vita, karoli, magni, from, the, late, eighth, century, the, attackers, were, basques, seeking, revenge, against, charlemagne, s, army, for, the, looting, of, pamplona, the, following, is, the, depiction, in, the, poem, itself, not, a, historical, account, charlemagne, s, army, is, fighting, the, arab, muslims, in, spain, they, have, campaigned, for, seven, years, and, the, last, city, standing, is, saragossa, held, by, king, marsile, who, is, pictured, not, as, a, muslim, but, a, follower, of, mahumet, and, apollin, threatened, by, the, might, of, charlemagne, s, franks, marsile, seeks, advice, from, his, wise, man, blancandrin, who, counsels, him, to, conciliate, the, emperor, offering, to, surrender, and, giving, hostages, accordingly, marsile, sends, out, messengers, to, charlemagne, promising, treasure, and, marsile, s, conversion, to, christianity, if, the, franks, will, go, back, to, francia, charlemagne, and, his, men, tired, of, fighting, accept, his, peace, offer, and, select, a, messenger, to, marsile, s, court, the, protagonist, roland, charlemagne, s, nephew, nominates, his, stepfather, ganelon, as, messenger, ganelon, who, fears, being, murdered, by, the, enemy, and, accuses, roland, of, intending, this, takes, revenge, by, informing, the, saracens, of, a, way, to, ambush, the, rear, guard, of, charlemagne, s, army, led, by, roland, as, the, franks, re, enter, francia, through, the, mountain, passes, as, ganelon, predicted, roland, leads, the, rear, guard, with, the, wise, and, moderate, oliver, and, the, fierce, archbishop, turpin, the, muslims, ambush, them, at, roncesvalles, and, the, christians, are, overwhelmed, oliver, pleads, with, roland, to, blow, his, horn, to, call, for, help, but, roland, tells, him, that, blowing, his, horn, in, the, middle, of, the, battle, would, be, an, act, of, cowardice, if, roland, continues, to, refuse, oliver, will, not, let, roland, see, his, sister, again, whom, roland, loves, the, most, however, archbishop, turpin, intervenes, and, tells, them, that, the, battle, will, be, fatal, for, all, of, them, and, so, instructs, roland, to, blow, his, horn, oliphant, an, elephant, tusk, hunting, horn, to, call, for, help, from, the, frankish, army, the, emperor, hears, the, call, en, route, to, francia, charlemagne, and, his, noblemen, gallop, back, even, though, count, ganelon, tries, to, trick, them, roland, s, franks, fight, well, but, are, outnumbered, until, almost, all, his, men, are, dead, and, he, knows, that, charlemagne, s, army, can, no, longer, save, them, despite, this, he, blows, his, olifant, to, summon, revenge, blowing, so, hard, that, his, temples, start, to, bleed, after, a, few, more, fights, roland, succumbs, to, his, wounds, and, dies, a, martyr, s, death, angels, lift, his, soul, to, paradise, when, charlemagne, and, his, men, reach, the, battlefield, they, find, the, slaughtered, bodies, of, roland, and, his, men, they, pursue, the, muslims, into, the, river, ebro, where, the, muslims, drown, meanwhile, baligant, the, powerful, emir, of, babylon, has, arrived, in, spain, to, help, marsile, his, army, encounters, that, of, charlemagne, at, roncesvalles, where, the, christians, are, burying, and, mourning, their, dead, the, franks, fight, valiantly, when, charlemagne, kills, baligant, the, muslim, army, scatters, and, flees, leaving, the, franks, to, conquer, saragossa, with, marsile, s, wife, bramimonde, queen, of, saragossa, charlemagne, and, his, men, ride, back, to, aix, their, capital, in, francia, the, franks, discover, ganelon, s, betrayal, and, keep, him, in, chains, until, his, trial, where, ganelon, argues, that, his, action, was, legitimate, revenge, not, treason, while, the, council, of, barons, assembled, to, decide, the, traitor, s, fate, is, initially, swayed, by, this, claim, partially, out, of, fear, of, ganelon, s, friend, pinabel, who, threatens, to, fight, anyone, who, judges, ganelon, guilty, one, man, thierry, argues, that, because, roland, was, serving, charlemagne, when, ganelon, delivered, his, revenge, on, him, ganelon, s, action, constitutes, a, betrayal, pinabel, challenges, thierry, to, trial, by, combat, by, divine, intervention, thierry, kills, pinabel, by, this, the, franks, are, convinced, of, ganelon, s, treason, thus, he, is, torn, apart, by, having, four, galloping, horses, tied, one, to, each, arm, and, leg, and, thirty, of, his, relatives, are, hanged, bramimonde, converts, to, christianity, her, name, changing, to, juliana, while, sleeping, charlemagne, is, told, by, gabriel, to, ride, to, help, king, vivien, and, bemoans, his, life, the, song, is, written, in, stanzas, of, irregular, length, known, as, laisses, the, lines, are, decasyllabic, containing, ten, syllables, and, each, is, divided, by, a, strong, caesura, which, generally, falls, after, the, fourth, syllable, the, last, stressed, syllable, of, each, line, in, a, laisse, has, the, same, vowel, sound, as, every, other, end, syllable, in, that, laisse, the, laisse, is, therefore, an, assonal, not, a, rhyming, stanza, on, a, narrative, level, the, song, of, roland, features, extensive, use, of, repetition, parallelism, and, thesis, antithesis, pairs, roland, proposes, ganelon, for, the, dangerous, mission, to, sarrogossa, ganelon, designates, roland, to, man, the, rearguard, charlemagne, is, contrasted, with, baligant, unlike, later, renaissance, and, romantic, literature, the, poem, focuses, on, action, rather, than, introspection, the, characters, are, presented, through, what, they, do, not, through, what, they, think, or, feel, the, narrator, gives, few, explanations, for, characters, behaviour, the, warriors, are, stereotypes, defined, by, a, few, salient, traits, for, example, roland, is, loyal, and, trusting, while, ganelon, though, brave, is, traitorous, and, vindictive, the, story, moves, at, a, fast, pace, occasionally, slowing, down, and, recounting, the, same, scene, up, to, three, times, but, focusing, on, different, details, or, taking, a, different, perspective, each, time, the, effect, is, similar, to, a, film, sequence, shot, at, different, angles, so, that, new, and, more, important, details, come, to, light, with, each, shot, according, to, the, song, of, roland, the, legendary, sword, called, durandal, was, first, given, to, charlemagne, by, an, angel, it, contained, one, tooth, of, saint, peter, blood, of, saint, basil, hair, of, saint, denis, and, a, piece, of, the, raiment, of, the, blessed, virgin, mary, and, was, supposedly, the, sharpest, sword, in, all, existence, in, the, story, of, the, song, of, roland, the, weapon, is, given, to, roland, and, he, uses, it, to, defend, himself, single, handedly, against, thousands, of, muslim, attackers, according, to, one, 12th, century, legend, from, the, french, town, of, rocamadour, roland, threw, the, sword, into, a, cliffside, a, replication, of, the, legendary, sword, can, be, found, there, embedded, into, the, cliff, face, next, to, the, town, s, sanctuary, a, latin, poem, carmen, de, prodicione, guenonis, was, composed, around, 1120, and, a, latin, prose, version, historia, caroli, magni, often, known, as, the, pseudo, turpin, even, earlier, around, 1170, a, version, of, the, french, poem, was, translated, into, the, middle, high, german, rolandslied, by, konrad, der, pfaffe, formerly, thought, to, have, been, the, author, of, the, kaiserchronik, in, his, translation, konrad, replaces, french, topics, with, generically, christian, ones, the, work, was, translated, into, middle, dutch, in, the, 13th, century, it, was, also, rendered, into, occitan, verse, in, the, 14th, or, 15th, century, poem, of, ronsasvals, which, incorporates, the, later, southern, aesthetic, into, the, story, an, old, norse, version, of, the, song, of, roland, exists, as, karlamagn, s, saga, and, a, translation, into, the, artificial, literary, language, of, franco, venetian, is, also,

first, described, in, the, song, of, roland, there, is, also, faroese, adoption, of, this, ballad, named, runtsivalstr, i, battle, of, roncevaux, and, a, norwegian, version, called, rolandskvadet,

war, one, always, chooses, the, wrong, hero, oliver, should, have, been, the, hero, of, that, song, instead, of, being, given, second, place, with, the, blood, thirsty, bishop, turpin, in, the, oxford, version, oliver, is, reconciled, in, the, end, he, gives, roland, his, death, blow, by, accident, his, eyes, blinded, by, wounds, the, story, had, been, tidied, up, in, truth, oliver, strikes,
