the, nicomachean, ethics, n, a, k, m, k, i, n, n, ancient, greek, thika, nikomacheia, is, aristotle, s, best, known, works, on, ethics, the, science, of, the, good, for, human, life, that, which, is, the, goal, or, end, at, which, all, our, actions, aim, i, 2, it, consists, of, ten, sections, referred, to, as, books, and, is, closely, related, to, aristotle, s, eudemian, ethics, the, work, is, essential, for, the, interpretation, of, aristotelian, ethics, the, text, centers, upon, the, question, of, how, to, best, live, a, theme, previously, explored, in, the, works, of, plato, aristotle, s, friend, and, teacher, in, aristotle, s, metaphysics, he, describes, how, socrates, the, friend, and, teacher, of, plato, turned, philosophy, to, human, questions, whereas, pre, socratic, philosophy, had, only, been, theoretical, and, concerned, with, natural, science, ethics, aristotle, claimed, is, practical, rather, than, theoretical, in, the, aristotelian, senses, of, these, terms, it, is, not, merely, an, investigation, about, what, good, consists, of, but, it, aims, to, be, of, practical, help, in, achieving, the, good, ii, 2, 1103b, it, is, connected, to, another, of, aristotle, s, practical, works, politics, which, reflects, a, similar, goal, for, people, to, become, good, through, the, creation, and, maintenance, of, social, institutions, ethics, is, about, how, individuals, should, best, live, while, politics, adopts, the, perspective, of, a, law, giver, looking, at, the, good, of, a, whole, community, the, nicomachean, ethics, had, an, important, influence, on, the, european, middle, ages, and, was, one, of, the, core, works, of, medieval, philosophy, as, such, it, was, of, great, significance, in, the, development, of, all, modern, philosophy, as, well, as, european, law, and, theology, aristotle, became, known, as, the, philosopher, for, example, this, is, how, he, is, referred, to, in, the, works, of, thomas, aquinas, in, the, middle, ages, a, synthesis, between, aristotelian, ethics, and, christian, theology, became, widespread, as, introduced, by, albertus, magnus, the, most, important, version, of, this, synthesis, was, that, of, thomas, aquinas, other, more, averroist, aristotelians, such, as, marsilius, of, padua, were, also, influential, until, well, into, the, seventeenth, century, the, nicomachean, ethics, was, still, widely, regarded, as, the, main, authority, for, the, discipline, of, ethics, at, protestant, universities, with, over, fifty, protestant, commentaries, published, before, 1682, during, the, seventeenth, century, however, authors, such, as, francis, bacon, and, thomas, hobbes, argued, that, the, medieval, and, renaissance, aristotelian, tradition, in, practical, thinking, was, impeding, philosophy, interest, in, aristotle, s, ethics, has, been, renewed, by, the, virtue, ethics, revival, recent, philosophers, in, this, field, include, alasdair, macintyre, g, e, m, anscombe, mortimer, adler, hans, georg, gadamer, and, martha, nussbaum, the, title, is, usually, assumed, to, refer, to, aristotle, s, son, nicomachus, one, theory, is, that, the, work, was, dedicated, to, him, another, is, that, it, was, edited, by, him, though, he, is, believed, to, have, died, young, probably, before, he, could, have, managed, this, alone, another, possibility, is, that, the, work, was, dedicated, to, aristotle, s, father, who, was, also, named, nicomachus, it, is, unlikely, that, it, was, dedicated, by, aristotle, himself, as, it, does, not, appear, to, be, in, a, form, aristotle, intended, for, publication, rather, it, seems, to, be, something, like, lecture, notes, meant, for, the, lecturer, or, for, consultation, by, students, the, oldest, known, reference, to, the, nicomachean, ethics, by, that, title, is, in, the, works, of, atticus, c, 175, ce, who, also, references, the, eudemian, ethics, by, name, in, greek, the, title, is, ethika, nikomacheia, which, is, sometimes, also, given, in, the, genitive, form, as, ethik, n, nikomachei, n, the, latin, version, is, ethica, nicomachea, or, de, moribus, ad, nicomachum, the, nicomachean, ethics, is, often, abbreviated, as, ne, or, en, books, and, chapters, are, referred, to, with, roman, and, arabic, numerals, respectively, along, with, corresponding, bekker, numbers, so, for, example, ne, ii, 2, 1103b1, means, nicomachean, ethics, book, ii, chapter, 2, bekker, page, 1103, column, b, line, number, 1, chapter, divisions, and, the, number, of, chapters, in, a, book, are, somewhat, arbitrary, and, sometimes, different, compilers, divide, books, into, chapters, differently, parts, of, the, nicomachean, ethics, overlap, with, aristotle, s, eudemian, ethics, books, v, vi, and, vii, of, the, nicomachean, ethics, are, identical, to, books, iv, v, and, vi, of, the, eudemian, ethics, opinions, about, the, relationship, between, the, two, works, differ, one, suggestion, is, that, three, books, from, nicomachean, ethics, were, lost, and, subsequently, replaced, by, three, parallel, works, from, the, eudemian, ethics, which, would, explain, the, overlap, another, is, that, both, works, were, not, put, into, their, current, form, by, aristotle, but, by, an, editor, no, consensus, dates, the, composition, of, the, nicomachean, ethics, however, a, reference, in, the, text, to, a, battle, in, the, third, sacred, war, in, 353, bce, acts, as, a, terminus, post, quem, for, that, part, of, the, work, the, traditional, position, held, for, example, by, w, d, ross, is, that, the, nicomachean, ethics, is, a, product, of, the, last, period, of, aristotle, s, life, during, his, time, in, athens, from, 335, bce, until, his, death, in, 322, bce, according, to, strabo, and, plutarch, after, aristotle, s, death, his, library, and, writings, went, to, theophrastus, aristotle, s, successor, as, head, of, the, lycaeum, and, the, peripatetic, school, after, the, death, of, theophrastus, the, library, went, to, neleus, of, scepsis, the, kingdom, of, pergamon, conscripted, books, for, a, royal, library, leading, the, heirs, of, neleus, hid, their, collection, in, a, cellar, to, prevent, its, seizure, the, library, remained, there, for, about, a, century, and, a, half, in, conditions, that, were, not, ideal, for, document, preservation, on, the, death, of, attalus, iii, which, also, ended, the, royal, library, ambitions, the, existence, of, aristotelian, library, was, disclosed, and, it, was, purchased, by, apellicon, and, returned, to, athens, in, about, 100, bce, apellicon, sought, to, recover, the, texts, many, of, which, were, degraded, by, their, time, in, the, cellar, he, had, them, copied, into, new, manuscripts, and, used, his, best, guesswork, to, fill, in, the, gaps, where, the, originals, were, unreadable, when, sulla, seized, athens, in, 86, bce, he, seized, the, library, and, transferred, it, to, rome, there, andronicus, of, rhodes, organized, the, texts, into, the, first, complete, edition, of, aristotle, s, works, and, works, attributed, to, him, these, relics, form, the, basis, of, present, day, editions, including, that, of, the, nicomachean, ethics, aspasius, wrote, a, commentary, on, the, nicomachean, ethics, in, the, early, 2nd, century, ce, it, suggests, that, the, text, was, very, like, what, it, is, now, with, little, or, no, difference, for, instance, of, order, or, arrangement, and, with, readings, identical, for, the, most, part, with, those, preserved, in, one, or, other, of, our, best, aspasius, noted, the, existence, of, variants, which, shows, that, there, was, some, element, of, uncertainty, as, to, the, text, even, in, this, comparatively, early, stage, in, the, history, of, the, book, the, oldest, surviving, manuscript, is, the, codex, laurentianus, lxxxi, 11, referred, to, as, k, b, which, dates, to, the, 10th, century, aristotle, was, the, first, philosopher, to, write, ethical, treatises, and, begins, by, considering, how, to, approach, the, subject, he, argues, that, the, correct, approach, for, subjects, like, ethics, or, politics, which, involve, a, discussion, on, beauty, or, justice, is, to, start, by, considering, what, would, be, roughly, agreed, to, be, true, by, people, of, good, upbringing, and, substantial, life, experience, and, then, to, work, from, those, intuitions, toward, a, more, rigorous, understanding, i, 3, 4, 6, 7, over, the, course, of, the, ethics, aristotle, alternates, between, a, theoretical, systematic, approach, to, formalizing, ethics, and, an, empirical, approach, of, consulting, opinion, prior, philosophical, or, literary, works, and, linguistic, clues, aristotle, s, ethics, is, said, to, be, teleological, in, that, it, is, based, on, an, investigation, into, the, telos, or, end, of, a, human, in, aristotle, s, philosophy, the, telos, of, a, thing, can, hardly, be, separated, from, the, perfection, of, that, thing, and, the, final, cause, of, anything, becomes, identical, with, the, good, of, that, thing, so, that, the, end, and, the, good, become, synonymous, terms, taking, this, approach, aristotle, proposes, that, the, highest, good, for, humans, is, eudaimonia, a, greek, word, often, translated, as, flourishing, or, sometimes, happiness, aristotle, argues, that, eudaimonia, is, a, way, of, taking, action, energeia, that, is, appropriate, to, the, human, soul, psuch, at, its, most, excellent, or, virtuous, aret, eudaimonia, is, the, most, complete, aim, that, people, can, have, because, they, choose, it, for, its, own, sake, an, excellent, human, is, one, who, is, good, at, living, life, who, does, so, well, and, beautifully, kalos, aristotle, says, such, a, person, would, also, be, a, serious, spoudaios, human, being, he, also, asserts, that, virtue, for, a, human, must, involve, reason, in, thought, and, speech, logos, as, this, is, a, task, ergon, of, human, living, i, 7, 1098a, after, proposing, this, ultimate, end, of, human, activity, aristotle, discusses, what, ethics, means, aristotelian, ethics, is, about, how, specific, beneficial, habits, virtues, enable, a, person, to, achieve, eudaimonia, and, how, to, develop, a, virtuous, character, ethik, aret, he, describes, a, sequence, of, necessary, steps, the, first, step, is, to, practice, righteous, actions, perhaps, under, the, guidance, of, teachers, in, order, to, develop, good, habits, practiced, habits, form, a, stable, character, in, which, those, habits, become, voluntary, which, then, achieves, eudaimonia, ii, 1, 1103b, the, greek, word, thos, or, character, is, related, to, modern, words, such, as, ethics, and, ethos, aristotle, does, not, equate, character, with, habit, ethos, in, greek, with, a, short, e, because, character, involves, conscious, choice, instead, character, is, an, hexis, like, health, or, knowledge, a, stable, disposition, that, must, be, maintained, with, effort, however, good, habits, are, a, precondition, for, good, character, aristotle, reviews, specific, ways, in, which, people, are, thought, worthy, of, praise, or, blame, he, describes, how, the, highest, types, of, praise, require, having, all, the, virtues, and, these, in, turn, imply, more, than, good, character, indeed, a, kind, of, wisdom, the, four, essential, virtues, are, the, eudemian, ethics, viii, 3, also, uses, the, word, kalokagathia, the, nobility, of, a, gentleman, kalokagathos, to, describe, this, same, concept, of, a, virtue, encompassing, all, the, moral, virtues, the, view, that, praiseworthy, virtues, in, their, highest, form, even, virtues, such, as, courage, require, intellectual, virtue, is, a, theme, aristotle, associates, with, socrates, it, is, portrayed, in, the, socratic, dialogues, of, plato, aristotle, professes, to, work, differently, from, plato, by, trying, to, start, with, what, well, brought, up, men, would, agree, with, and, to, take, a, practical, approach, but, by, book, vii, aristotle, argues, that, the, highest, of, virtues, is, not, a, practical, one, contemplative, wisdom, the, ria, however, achieving, wisdom, requires, all, the, virtues, of, character, or, moral, virtues, aristotle, s, view, that, the, highest, good, for, man, has, both, a, practical, and, theoretical, side, is, in, the, tradition, of, socrates, and, plato, but, in, opposition, to, pre, socratic, philosophy, as, ronna, burger, points, out, the, ethics, does, not, end, at, its, apparent, peak, identifying, perfect, happiness, with, the, life, devoted, to, the, ria, instead, it, goes, on, to, introduce, the, need, for, a, study, of, legislation, on, the, grounds, that, it, is, not, sufficient, only, to, know, about, virtue, but, one, should, try, to, put, that, knowledge, to, use, at, the, end, of, the, book, according, to, burger, the, thoughtful, reader, is, led, to, understand, that, the, end, we, are, seeking, is, what, we, have, been, doing, while, engaging, with, the, ethics, book, i, attempts, to, define, the, subject, matter, of, ethics, and, justify, his, method, for, examining, it, i, 3, 4, 6, 7, as, part, of, this, aristotle, considers, common, sense, opinions, along, with, those, of, poets, and, philosophers, aristotle, points, out, that, things, that, are, beautiful, and, just, about, which, politics, investigates, involve, great, disagreement, and, inconsistency, so, that, they, are, thought, to, belong, only, to, convention, and, not, to, nature, for, this, reason, aristotle, says, we, should, not, demand, exacting, rigor, akribeia, like, we, might, expect, from, a, mathematician, but, rather, look, for, answers, about, things, that, are, so, for, the, most, part, he, claimed, that, people, are, satisfactory, judges, of, such, subjects, after, they, become, acquainted, with, them, however, as, the, young, in, age, or, in, character, are, inexperienced, they, are, less, likely, to, benefit, from, this, kind, of, study, i, 6, contains, a, famous, digression, in, which, aristotle, appears, to, question, his, friends, who, introduced, the, forms, this, refers, to, plato, and, his, school, and, their, theory, of, forms, aristotle, says, that, while, both, the, truth, and, one, s, friends, are, loved, it, is, a, sacred, thing, to, give, the, highest, honor, to, the, truth, signaling, his, belief, that, the, theory, of, forms, is, not, that, a, forms, based, discussion, of, the, good, might, try, to, discover, some, characteristic, that, all, good, things, have, in, common, aristotle, does, not, find, this, approach, promising, because, the, word, good, is, used, in, too, many, ways, he, says, that, while, it, is, probably, not, coincidental, that, various, things, called, good, share, that, description, it, is, perhaps, better, to, let, go, for, now, the, quest, for, some, common, characteristic, as, this, would, be, more, at, home, in, another, type, of, philosophic, inquiry, not, helpful, for, discussing, how, people, should, act, in, the, same, way, that, doctors, do, not, need, to, philosophize, over, the, definition, of, health, in, order, to, treat, each, case, the, opening, passage, asserts, that, all, technical, arts, all, investigations, every, methodos, including, the, ethics, itself, indeed, all, deliberate, actions, and, choices, aim, at, some, good, apart, from, themselves, many, such, goods, are, intermediate, desired, only, as, means, to, higher, goods, i, 1, 1094a, aristotle, asserts, that, there, is, one, highest, good, eudaimonia, traditionally, translated, as, happiness, or, flourishing, which, is, what, good, politics, should, target, because, what, is, best, for, an, individual, is, less, beautiful, kalos, and, divine, theios, than, what, is, good, for, a, people, ethnos, or, community, polis, politics, organizes, communal, practical, life, so, the, proper, aim, of, politics, should, include, the, proper, aim, of, all, other, pursuits, and, this, end, would, be, the, human, good, tanthr, pinon, agathon, the, human, good, is, a, practical, target, in, contrast, to, plato, s, references, to, the, good, itself, aristotle, concludes, that, ethics, our, investigation, or, methodos, is, in, a, certain, way, political, aristotle, then, elaborates, on, the, methodological, concern, with, exactness, he, claims, that, ethics, unlike, some, other, types, of, philosophy, is, inexact, and, uncertain, he, says, that, it, would, be, unreasonable, to, expect, demonstrations, of, strict, mathematical, exactitude, but, rather, each, man, judges, correctly, those, matters, with, which, he, is, acquainted, aristotle, states, that, while, most, would, agree, to, call, the, highest, aim, of, humanity, eudaimonia, and, also, to, equate, this, with, both, living, well, and, doing, things, well, disagreement, about, what, this, is, persists, between, the, majority, hoi, polloi, and, the, wise, i, 4, 1095a, 1095b, he, distinguishes, three, possible, ways, of, life, that, people, associate, with, happiness, i, 5, 1095b, 1096a, aristotle, mentions, two, other, possibilities, that, he, argues, can, be, discarded, each, commonly, proposed, happy, way, of, life, is, a, target, that, some, people, aim, at, for, its, own, sake, just, like, they, aim, at, happiness, itself, for, its, own, sake, as, for, honor, pleasure, and, intelligence, nous, as, well, as, every, virtue, though, they, lead, to, happiness, even, if, they, did, not, we, would, still, pursue, them, happiness, in, life, therefore, includes, the, virtues, and, aristotle, adds, that, it, would, include, self, sufficiency, autarkeia, not, the, self, sufficiency, of, a, hermit, but, of, someone, with, a, family, friends, and, community, someone, whose, eudaimonia, leaves, them, satisfied, lacking, nothing, to, describe, more, clearly, what, happiness, is, like, aristotle, next, asks, what, the, work, or, function, ergon, of, a, human, is, all, living, things, have, nutrition, and, growth, as, a, work, all, animals, according, to, aristotle, s, definition, of, animal, have, perception, as, part, of, their, work, but, what, work, is, particularly, human, the, answer, according, to, aristotle, is, that, it, must, involve, reason, logos, including, both, being, open, to, persuasion, by, reasoning, and, thinking, things, through, not, only, does, human, happiness, involve, reason, but, is, also, an, active, being, at, work, energeia, not, just, a, potential, and, it, is, measured, over, a, lifetime, because, one, swallow, does, not, make, a, spring, the, definition, given, is, therefore, the, good, of, man, is, the, active, exercise, of, his, soul, s, faculties, in, conformity, with, excellence, or, virtue, or, if, there, be, several, human, excellences, or, virtues, in, conformity, with, the, best, and, most, perfect, among, them, moreover, to, be, happy, takes, a, complete, lifetime, for, one, swallow, does, not, make, a, spring, because, the, good, of, a, person, is, a, work, or, function, just, as, we, can, contrast, casual, harpists, with, serious, harpists, the, person, who, lives, well, and, beautifully, in, this, actively, rational, and, virtuous, way, will, be, a, serious, spoudaios, person, i, 7, 1097a, 1098b, if, happiness, is, virtue, or, a, certain, virtue, then, it, must, not, just, be, a, condition, of, being, virtuous, potentially, but, an, actual, way, of, virtuously, being, at, work, as, a, human, for, as, in, the, ancient, olympic, games, it, is, not, the, most, beautiful, or, the, strongest, who, are, crowned, but, those, who, compete, i, 8, and, such, virtue, will, be, good, beautiful, and, pleasant, indeed, aristotle, asserts, that, in, most, people, different, pleasures, are, in, conflict, with, each, other, while, the, things, that, are, pleasant, to, those, who, are, passionately, devoted, to, what, is, beautiful, are, the, things, that, are, pleasant, by, nature, and, of, this, sort, are, actions, in, accordance, with, virtue, i, 8, external, goods, are, also, necessary, in, such, a, virtuous, life, because, a, person, who, lacks, things, such, as, good, family, and, friends, might, find, it, difficult, to, be, happy, aristotle, addresses, some, objections, that, might, be, raised, against, his, proposed, definition, of, eudaimonia, first, he, considers, a, socratic, question, found, for, example, in, plato, s, meno, of, whether, eudaimonia, might, be, a, result, of, learning, or, habit, or, training, or, perhaps, divine, grace, or, random, chance, aristotle, says, that, eudaimonia, does, result, from, some, sort, of, learning, or, training, but, although, not, god, given, eudaimonia, is, one, of, the, most, divine, things, and, for, what, is, greatest, and, most, beautiful, to, be, left, to, chance, would, be, too, discordant, aristotle, says, eudaimonia, must, be, considered, over, a, lifetime, otherwise, priam, for, example, might, be, defined, as, unhappy, only, because, of, his, unhappy, old, age, i, 9, 10, concerning, the, importance, of, chance, to, eudaimonia, aristotle, argues, that, a, person, at, work, in, accordance, with, virtue, will, bear, with, dignity, whatever, fortune, sends, and, will, always, make, the, best, of, his, circumstances, as, a, good, general, will, turn, the, forces, at, his, command, to, the, best, account, and, a, good, shoemaker, will, make, the, best, shoe, that, can, be, made, out, of, a, given, piece, of, leather, and, so, on, with, all, other, crafts, i, 10, only, many, great, misfortunes, will, limit, how, blessed, such, a, life, can, be, but, even, in, these, circumstances, something, beautiful, shines, through, aristotle, says, that, it, seems, too, unfeeling, and, contrary, to, people, s, opinions, to, claim, that, the, postmortem, fortunes, of, one, s, descendants, and, all, one, s, friends, have, no, influence, at, all, on, one, s, eudaimonia, but, he, says, it, seems, that, if, anything, at, all, gets, through, to, the, deceased, in, this, indirect, way, whether, good, or, bad, it, would, be, something, faint, and, small, aristotle, distinguishes, virtue, and, eudaimonia, virtue, through, which, people, become, apt, at, performing, beautiful, actions, is, praiseworthy, while, eudaimonia, is, something, beyond, praise, blessed, since, every, one, of, us, does, everything, else, for, the, sake, of, this, and, we, set, down, the, source, and, cause, of, good, things, as, something, honored, and, divine, aristotle, asserts, that, some, things, can, be, accepted, about, the, soul, another, reference, to, plato, including, the, division, of, the, soul, into, rational, and, irrational, parts, and, the, further, division, of, the, irrational, parts, into, two, parts, the, virtues, then, are, similarly, divided, into, intellectual, dianoetic, virtues, and, virtues, of, character, concerning, the, irrational, part, of, the, soul, that, is, amenable, to, reason, this, second, set, of, virtues, moral, virtues, as, they, are, often, translated, are, the, central, topic, of, book, ii, aristotle, says, that, whereas, intellectual, virtue, requires, teaching, experience, and, time, virtue, of, character, comes, about, as, a, consequence, of, adopting, good, habits, humans, have, a, natural, capacity, to, develop, these, virtues, but, that, training, determines, whether, they, actually, develop, ii, 1, 1103a, 1103b, aristotle, says, moral, virtues, are, found, at, a, mean, mes, t, s, between, deficiency, and, excess, for, example, someone, who, flees, is, a, coward, with, a, deficiency, of, bravery, or, an, excessive, response, to, fear, while, someone, who, fears, nothing, is, rash, the, opposite, extreme, the, virtue, of, courage, is, a, mean, between, these, two, extremes, for, this, reason, aristotle, is, considered, a, proponent, of, the, golden, mean, doctrine, people, first, perform, actions, that, are, virtuous, possibly, guided, by, teachers, or, experience, these, habitual, actions, then, become, virtues, when, people, characteristically, choose, such, actions, deliberately, ii, 2, 1103b, 1104b, according, to, aristotle, character, properly, understood, is, not, just, any, tendency, or, habit, but, something, that, influences, what, causes, pleasure, or, pain, a, virtuous, person, feels, pleasure, when, they, perform, the, most, beautiful, or, noble, kalos, actions, their, practice, of, virtues, and, their, pleasure, therefore, coincide, a, person, who, is, not, virtuous, on, the, other, hand, often, finds, pleasure, to, be, misleading, for, this, reason, the, study, of, virtue, or, of, politics, requires, consideration, of, pleasure, and, pain, ii, 3, 1104b, 1105a, it, is, not, enough, to, perform, virtuous, actions, by, chance, or, by, following, advice, it, is, not, like, in, the, productive, arts, where, the, product, is, judged, as, well, made, or, not, to, be, a, virtuous, person, one, s, virtuous, actions, must, be, just, knowing, what, would, be, virtuous, is, not, enough, ii, 4, 1105a, 1105b, according, to, aristotle, s, analysis, the, soul, contains, virtues, are, hexeis, none, of, the, other, qualities, of, the, soul, are, chosen, and, none, is, praiseworthy, in, the, way, that, virtue, is, ii, 5, 1105b, 1106a, as, with, the, productive, arts, technai, with, virtues, of, character, the, focus, must, be, on, the, making, of, a, good, human, in, a, static, sense, and, on, making, a, human, that, functions, well, as, a, human, ii, 6, 1106b, 1107a, in, ii, 7, aristotle, gives, a, list, of, character, virtues, and, vices, that, he, discusses, in, books, ii, and, iii, this, list, differs, between, the, nicomachean, and, eudemian, ethics, he, reiterates, that, it, is, not, meant, to, be, exhaustive, ii, 7, 1107a, 1108b, aristotle, also, mentions, some, ways, of, observing, the, mean, that, involve, feelings, or, emotions, a, sense, of, shame, for, example, is, sometimes, praised, or, said, to, be, in, excess, or, deficiency, righteous, indignation, nemesis, is, a, sort, of, mean, between, schadenfreude, and, envy, aristotle, says, he, intends, to, discuss, such, cases, later, before, the, discussion, of, justice, in, book, v, but, the, nicomachean, ethics, does, not, discuss, righteous, indignation, there, which, is, however, discussed, in, the, eudemian, ethics, book, viii, aristotle, says, that, in, practice, people, tend, by, nature, towards, the, more, pleasurable, of, the, vicious, extremes, and, therefore, to, them, the, virtuous, mean, appears, to, be, relatively, closer, to, the, less, pleasant, extreme, for, this, reason, it, is, a, good, practice, to, steer, toward, the, extreme, that, is, less, pleasant, while, you, are, hunting, for, the, mean, which, will, help, to, correct, for, that, tendency, ii, 8, 1108b, 1109b, however, this, rule, of, thumb, is, shown, in, later, parts, of, the, ethics, to, apply, mainly, to, some, bodily, pleasures, and, aristotle, asserts, it, to, be, wrong, as, an, accurate, general, rule, in, book, x, x, 1, 5, aristotle, begins, by, distinguishing, human, actions, as, voluntary, involuntary, and, chosen, unchosen, and, investigates, what, makes, an, action, worthy, of, praise, or, blame, honor, or, punishment, and, pardon, or, pity, iii, 1, 3, 1109b30, 1110b, aristotle, divides, wrong, actions, into, three, categories, the, two, varieties, of, ignorance, differ, as, to, how, they, affect, blame, ignorance, of, what, is, good, and, bad, is, itself, blameworthy, a, sign, of, bad, character, but, once, the, difference, is, learned, misconceptions, about, some, particular, situation, that, leads, to, choosing, the, bad, while, thinking, it, good, is, excusable, i, 1, aristotle, explains, this, in, terms, of, syllogistic, reasoning, imagine, a, syllogism, of, this, form, it, would, be, bad, to, serve, poison, to, your, father, this, glass, of, wine, has, been, poisoned, therefore, it, would, be, bad, to, serve, this, glass, of, wine, to, your, father, serving, the, wine, in, ignorance, of, the, first, universal, premise, but, not, the, second, is, depraved, ignorance, of, the, second, particular, premise, but, not, the, first, is, merely, a, mistake, aristotle, defines, and, discusses, several, more, critical, terms, virtue, and, vice, according, to, aristotle, are, up, to, us, although, no, one, is, willingly, unhappy, vice, which, leads, to, unhappiness, always, involves, chosen, actions, vice, comes, from, bad, habits, and, aiming, at, the, wrong, things, not, from, seeking, to, be, unhappy, lawmakers, are, cognizant, of, these, distinctions, they, try, to, encourage, or, discourage, various, voluntary, actions, but, do, not, concern, themselves, with, involuntary, actions, they, also, tend, not, to, be, lenient, towards, people, who, act, from, negligent, ignorance, for, instance, if, they, are, drunk, ignorant, about, things, that, are, easy, to, learn, or, have, allowed, themselves, to, develop, bad, habits, and, a, bad, character, though, people, with, a, bad, character, may, be, ignorant, and, even, seem, incapable, of, choosing, right, things, such, a, condition, stems, from, decisions, that, were, originally, voluntary, similar, to, how, poor, health, can, develop, from, past, choices, and, while, no, one, blames, those, who, are, ill, formed, by, nature, people, do, censure, those, who, are, that, way, through, lack, of, exercise, and, neglect, iii, 5, 1113b, 1115a, aristotle, then, considers, some, specific, character, virtues, starting, with, two, that, concern, the, irrational, parts, of, the, soul, fear, and, desire, courage, and, temperance, to, have, courage, means, to, characteristically, display, appropriate, confidence, in, the, face, of, fearful, situations, however, some, fears, are, noble, like, the, fear, of, disgrace, and, to, be, fearless, in, such, a, situation, is, something, closer, to, shamelessness, courage, usually, refers, to, confidence, and, fear, concerning, man, made, evils, it, is, exemplified, by, courage, in, the, face, of, the, most, fear, laden, thing, death, particularly, death, in, battle, iii, 6, 1115a, aristotle, says, that, fear, of, death, is, particularly, pronounced, in, those, who, have, lived, a, life, that, is, both, happy, and, virtuous, death, is, worse, if, the, life, it, threatens, is, unusually, good, and, this, may, make, courage, ironically, more, difficult, to, achieve, for, people, who, otherwise, are, skilled, in, the, virtues, everything, humans, do, characteristically, that, is, as, a, manifestation, of, some, characteristic, trait, such, as, courage, is, done, for, a, purpose, that, is, identical, to, the, purpose, of, that, trait, any, particular, courageous, act, has, the, same, aim, at, least, with, respect, to, its, courageousness, as, the, general, trait, of, courageousness, does, the, aim, of, a, particular, act, done, courageously, is, not, in, the, specific, and, incidental, goals, of, the, action, but, in, the, service, of, the, virtue, of, courageousness, a, person, develops, courage, once, he, or, she, sees, courageousness, as, honorable, beautiful, and, noble, as, a, glory, to, human, nature, as, j, a, stewart, put, it, in, his, summary, of, this, chapter, people, who, have, excessive, fearlessness, would, be, mad, aristotle, remarks, that, some, describe, celts, this, way, aristotle, also, says, that, rash, people, thrasus, those, with, excessive, confidence, are, generally, cowards, putting, on, a, brave, face, iii, 7, 1115b, 1116a, aristotle, notes, that, the, term, courage, is, sometimes, misapplied, to, five, other, types, of, character, iii, 8, 1116a, 1117a, avoiding, fear, is, more, important, when, aiming, at, courage, than, avoiding, overconfidence, as, in, the, examples, above, overconfident, people, are, likely, to, be, called, courageous, or, considered, close, to, courageous, as, aristotle, said, in, book, ii, with, moral, virtues, such, as, courage, the, extreme, one, s, normal, desires, tends, away, from, is, the, best, one, to, aim, towards, when, trying, to, find, the, mean, courage, leads, people, to, risk, pain, and, therefore, away, from, what, they, would, more, typically, desire, the, courageous, person, values, courageous, action, more, than, they, fear, pain, or, even, death, iii, 9, 1117a, 1117b, aristotle, s, treatment, of, this, subject, is, often, compared, to, plato, s, courage, was, dealt, with, by, plato, in, laches, temperance, sophrosyne, also, translated, as, soundness, of, mind, moderation, discretion, is, a, mean, with, regards, to, pleasure, the, vice, that, occurs, most, often, is, excess, in, pursuit, of, pleasure, akolasia, licentiousness, intemperance, profligacy, dissipation, etc, the, vice, of, deficiency, by, contrast, is, so, unusual, that, aristotle, calls, people, with, it, almost, imaginary, characters, and, cannot, find, a, greek, word, for, that, vice, iii, 11, pleasures, are, divided, into, those, of, the, soul, and, those, of, the, body, but, those, who, are, concerned, with, pleasures, of, the, soul, honor, or, learning, for, example, are, not, typically, referred, to, as, temperate, or, dissolute, not, all, bodily, pleasures, are, relevant, either, for, example, delighting, in, sights, or, sounds, or, smells, are, about, temperance, unless, it, is, a, smell, food, or, perfume, that, triggers, yearning, temperance, and, dissipation, concern, the, animal, like, aphrodisiac, pleasures, of, touch, and, taste, iii, 10, 1117b, 1118b, some, desires, like, that, of, food, and, drink, or, sex, are, shared, by, all, creatures, but, such, desires, may, manifest, themselves, variously, desiring, the, wrong, thing, desiring, too, much, or, desiring, in, the, wrong, manner, are, all, intemperate, the, temperate, person, desires, things, that, are, not, impediments, to, health, not, contrary, to, what, is, beautiful, nor, beyond, that, person, s, resources, such, a, person, judges, according, to, right, reason, orthos, logos, iii, 11, 1118b, 1119a, appetite, is, a, form, of, pain, the, intemperate, are, pained, excessively, about, not, getting, bodily, touch, pleasure, temperate, people, are, not, so, easily, pained, intemperance, is, a, more, willingly, chosen, vice, than, cowardice, because, it, positively, seeks, pleasure, while, cowardice, avoids, pain, pain, can, make, it, harder, to, exercise, choice, for, this, reason, intemperance, is, more, criticized, because, it, should, be, easier, to, habituate, so, as, to, avoid, it, in, greek, the, word, aristotle, uses, for, intemperate, is, the, same, one, used, for, unchastened, as, in, a, spoiled, child, aristotle, thinks, this, is, apt, as, temperance, is, about, disciplining, the, needy, child, inside, of, us, so, that, appetites, do, not, escape, the, control, of, reason, iii, 12, 1119a, 1119b, the, moral, virtues, discussed, in, book, iv, concern, behavior, in, social, or, political, situations, book, iv, is, sometimes, described, as, reflecting, the, norms, of, an, athenian, gentleman, in, aristotle, s, time, while, this, is, consistent, with, the, approach, aristotle, said, he, would, take, in, book, i, long, running, disagreement, concerns, whether, this, was, a, framework, for, deriving, more, general, conclusions, for, example, in, book, vi, or, whether, it, shows, that, aristotle, failed, to, generalize, and, that, his, ethical, thinking, was, parochial, this, virtue, concerns, how, people, act, with, regards, to, donating, receiving, money, and, things, whose, worth, is, valued, in, terms, of, money, the, two, extremes, of, deficiency, and, excess, are, wastefulness, and, stinginess, respectively, aristotle, s, approach, to, defining, the, correct, balance, is, to, treat, money, like, any, other, useful, thing, and, say, that, virtue, is, to, know, how, to, use, money, giving, to, the, right, people, in, the, right, amount, at, the, right, time, as, with, each, of, the, ethical, virtues, aristotle, emphasizes, that, a, virtuous, person, is, pleased, to, do, the, virtuous, and, beautiful, thing, it, is, better, to, err, on, the, side, of, generosity, a, liberal, person, is, more, annoyed, if, he, has, not, spent, something, that, he, ought, than, pained, if, he, has, spent, something, that, he, ought, not, aristotle, pointed, out, that, we, do, not, praise, someone, simply, for, not, taking, which, might, however, earn, praise, for, being, just, t, is, more, characteristic, of, virtue, to, do, what, is, noble, than, not, to, do, what, is, base, he, also, points, out, that, generous, people, are, loved, practically, the, most, of, those, who, are, recognized, for, virtue, since, they, confer, benefits, iv, 1, aristotle, says, the, source, of, donated, money, is, important, a, decent, sort, of, taking, goes, along, with, a, decent, sort, of, giving, profligate, people, are, often, wasteful, and, stingy, at, the, same, time, when, trying, to, be, generous, they, often, take, from, the, wrong, sources, for, example, pimps, loan, sharks, gamblers, thieves, and, give, to, the, wrong, people, such, people, can, be, helped, by, guidance, unlike, stingy, people, and, most, people, are, somewhat, stingy, stinginess, is, the, opposite, of, generosity, both, because, it, is, a, greater, evil, than, wastefulness, and, because, people, go, wrong, more, often, with, it, than, from, the, sort, of, wastefulness, described, magnificence, is, similar, to, generosity, but, concerns, larger, amounts, aristotle, says, that, while, the, magnificent, man, is, liberal, the, liberal, man, is, not, necessarily, magnificent, the, immoderate, vices, in, this, case, concern, making, a, great, display, on, the, wrong, occasions, and, in, the, wrong, way, the, extremes, to, be, avoided, in, order, to, achieve, this, virtue, are, paltriness, or, chintziness, on, the, one, hand, and, vulgarity, on, the, other, aristotle, notes, that, moral, dispositions, hexeis, are, caused, by, activities, energeia, meaning, that, a, magnificent, person, s, virtue, can, be, seen, from, the, way, he, chooses, to, do, magnificent, acts, at, the, right, times, aristotle, emphasizes, the, public, nature, of, the, giving, receiving, foreign, dignitaries, making, religious, offerings, erecting, public, buildings, funding, festivals, and, entertainments, throwing, weddings, lavishly, decorating, a, home, for, even, a, house, is, a, sort, of, public, ornament, because, he, seeks, spectacle, a, person, with, this, virtue, does, not, focus, on, doing, things, cheaply, which, would, be, petty, and, may, well, overspend, as, with, liberality, aristotle, sees, a, potential, conflict, between, some, virtues, and, skill, with, money, he, says, that, magnificence, requires, spending, according, to, means, at, least, in, the, sense, that, poor, men, cannot, be, magnificent, the, vices, of, paltriness, and, vulgar, chintziness, do, not, bring, serious, discredit, since, they, are, not, injurious, to, others, nor, are, they, excessively, unseemly, magnanimity, is, a, latinization, of, the, greek, megalopsuchia, which, means, greatness, of, soul, although, the, word, has, a, connection, to, aristotelian, philosophy, it, has, a, distinct, meaning, in, english, which, may, confuse, some, modern, translations, refer, to, greatness, of, soul, the, term, implies, not, just, greatness, but, a, person, who, correctly, thinks, themselves, worthy, of, great, things, although, that, could, imply, vainglory, aristotle, defines, it, as, a, virtue, he, says, not, everybody, who, claims, more, than, he, deserves, is, vain, and, indeed, most, small, souled, of, all, would, seem, to, be, the, man, who, claims, less, than, he, deserves, when, his, deserts, are, great, vanity, or, small, souls, are, the, two, extremes, that, fail, to, achieve, the, virtue, of, magnanimity, the, small, souled, person, according, to, aristotle, seems, to, have, something, bad, about, him, to, have, the, virtue, of, greatness, of, soul, and, be, worthy, of, what, is, greatest, one, must, possess, greatness, in, all, virtues, sachs, points, out, greatness, of, soul, is, the, first, of, four, virtues, that, aristotle, will, find, to, require, the, presence, of, all, the, virtues, of, character, the, others, are, a, type, of, justice, v, phronesis, or, practical, judgment, as, shown, by, good, leaders, vi, and, truly, good, friends, viii, aristotle, views, magnanimity, as, a, sort, of, adornment, of, the, moral, virtues, for, it, makes, them, greater, and, it, does, not, arise, without, them, aristotle, considers, what, things, are, most, worthy, of, external, goods, the, greatest, is, honor, because, this, is, what, we, assign, to, gods, and, this, is, what, people, of, the, highest, standing, target, aristotle, says, that, great, souled, people, don, t, pursue, anything, immoderately, including, honor, excellence, and, becoming, worthy, of, honor, is, more, important, the, haughty, unconcern, and, disdain, of, a, great, souled, person, and, his, presumption, and, self, regard, and, the, way, he, works, to, dominate, others, can, make, him, seem, arrogant, like, an, undeserving, vain, person, 1123b, 1124a, leo, strauss, proposes, a, close, kinship, between, aristotle, s, justice, and, biblical, justice, but, aristotle, s, magnanimity, which, means, a, man, s, habitual, claiming, for, himself, great, honors, while, he, deserves, these, honors, is, alien, to, the, bible, 276, 277, aristotle, lists, characteristics, of, the, great, souled, person, 1124b, 1125a, in, the, same, way, that, normal, generosity, was, considered, a, scaled, down, version, of, magnificence, aristotle, proposes, two, levels, of, virtue, associated, with, honors, one, concerned, with, great, honors, magnanimity, or, greatness, of, soul, and, another, with, ordinary, honors, this, latter, virtue, is, a, kind, of, correct, respect, for, honor, which, he, said, was, at, a, mean, between, being, ambitious, philotimos, honor, loving, and, unambitious, aphilotimos, not, honor, loving, this, virtue, might, be, exhibited, by, a, noble, and, manly, person, with, appropriate, ambition, or, in, a, less, ambitious, person, who, is, moderate, and, temperate, there, is, no, amount, of, virtuous, philotimos, to, have, the, correct, balance, in, this, virtue, means, pursuing, the, right, types, of, honor, from, the, right, sources, of, honor, in, contrast, the, glory, hound, craves, accolades, even, from, dubious, sources, and, whether, or, not, they, are, deserved, while, the, improperly, unambitious, man, does, not, desire, appropriately, to, be, honored, for, noble, reasons, 1125b, the, virtue, of, pra, t, s, is, the, correct, mean, concerning, anger, 1125b, 1126b, someone, with, the, vice, of, excess, irascibility, or, quickness, to, anger, is, angry, at, the, wrong, people, in, the, wrong, manner, and, so, on, the, vice, of, deficiency, is, found, in, people, who, refuse, to, defend, themselves, milquetoasts, servile, aristotle, does, not, deny, anger, a, place, in, the, behavior, of, a, good, person, but, says, it, should, be, on, the, right, grounds, and, against, the, right, persons, and, also, in, the, right, manner, and, at, the, right, moment, and, for, the, right, length, of, time, aristotle, says, it, is, not, easy, to, behave, according, to, the, mean, the, virtue, with, regards, to, anger, is, not, led, by, the, emotions, pathoi, but, by, reason, logos, anger, can, be, virtuous, and, rational, in, the, right, circumstances, and, a, small, amount, of, excess, is, not, blameworthy, and, might, even, be, praised, as, manly, and, fitted, for, command, it, is, better, however, to, err, on, the, side, of, forgiveness, than, anger, the, person, with, a, deficiency, in, this, virtue, despite, seeming, foolish, and, servile, is, closer, to, the, virtue, than, someone, who, angers, too, easily, another, virtue, concerns, interaction, with, others, iv, 6, 1126b, 1127a, an, obsequious, areskos, person, is, overly, concerned, with, pleasing, others, backing, down, too, easily, even, when, it, is, dishonorable, or, harmful, to, do, so, a, surly, duskolos, or, quarrelsome, dusteris, person, objects, to, everything, and, does, not, care, what, pain, they, cause, others, no, specific, greek, word, names, the, correct, virtuous, mean, but, aristotle, says, it, resembles, friendship, philia, the, difference, is, that, this, friendly, virtue, concerns, behavior, towards, friends, and, strangers, alike, and, does, not, involve, friends, emotional, bond, concerning, true, friendship, see, books, viii, and, ix, according, to, aristotle, getting, this, virtue, right, also, involves, he, describes, flattery, as, a, sort, of, cunning, obsequiousness, practiced, to, gain, advantage, aristotle, is, concerned, with, a, specific, type, of, honesty, self, representation, other, types, of, honesty, might, involve, virtues, such, as, justice, 1127a, 1127b, aristotle, said, that, no, convenient, greek, word, names, the, virtuous, and, honest, mean, describing, someone, who, claims, his, good, qualities, without, exaggeration, or, understatement, the, vice, of, excess, is, boastfulness, that, of, deficiency, is, self, deprecation, as, in, the, previous, case, concerning, obsequiousness, and, flattery, vices, concerned, with, self, representation, might, be, part, of, one, s, character, or, they, might, be, performed, as, if, they, were, in, character, but, really, with, some, ulterior, motive, as, in, many, of, these, examples, aristotle, says, the, vice, of, excess, boastfulness, is, more, blameworthy, than, that, of, deficiency, self, deprecation, aristotle, says, a, person, might, be, relatively, blameless, if, they, are, occasionally, dishonest, about, their, own, qualities, as, long, as, this, does, not, become, a, fixed, disposition, specifically, boasting, is, not, very, blameworthy, if, the, aim, is, honor, or, glory, but, is, if, the, aim, is, money, parts, of, this, section, critique, aristotle, s, practice, of, philosophy, at, one, point, he, says, that, examples, of, areas, where, dishonest, boasting, for, gain, might, go, undetected, and, be, very, blameworthy, would, be, prophecy, philosophy, or, medicine, all, of, which, have, both, pretense, and, bragging, this, appears, to, be, a, criticism, of, contemporary, sophists, but, one, of, the, words, for, the, vices, under, discussion, self, deprecation, greek, eir, neia, from, which, english, irony, was, and, is, used, to, describe, the, philosophical, technique, of, socrates, aristotle, specifically, mentions, socrates, as, an, example, writing, for, they, seem, to, be, avoiding, bombast, not, looking, for, profit, in, what, they, say, the, qualities, that, win, reputation, are, the, ones, that, these, people, especially, disavow, as, socrates, also, used, to, do, iv, 7, 14, but, at, the, same, time, he, notes, that, although, the, vice, of, deficiency, is, often, less, blameworthy, it, is, still, a, moral, deficiency, the, virtue, of, wit, charm, and, tact, and, generally, saying, the, right, things, when, speaking, playfully, aristotle, said, is, a, necessary, part, of, life, 1127b, 1128b, in, contrast, a, buffoon, can, never, resist, making, any, joke, and, the, deficient, vice, in, this, case, is, an, uncultivated, person, who, does, not, get, jokes, and, is, useless, in, playful, conversation, he, doubts, the, existence, of, rules, about, playful, discourse, so, a, person, with, this, virtue, will, tend, to, be, a, law, unto, himself, the, sense, of, shame, is, not, a, virtue, but, more, like, a, feeling, than, a, stable, character, trait, hexis, shame, derives, from, voluntary, acts, and, a, decent, person, does, not, voluntarily, act, shamefully, so, a, sense, of, shame, fits, awkwardly, into, a, scheme, of, virtues, though, shamelessness, is, certainly, a, vice, iv, 9, 1128b, in, youth, shame, is, attractive, since, young, people, are, expected, to, make, mistakes, because, of, their, inexperience, and, responding, to, these, mistakes, with, appropriate, shame, is, praiseworthy, in, adults, shame, is, not, admirable, book, v, is, the, same, as, book, iv, of, the, eudemian, ethics, the, first, of, three, books, common, to, both, works, it, represents, the, discussion, on, justice, dikaiosun, foreseen, in, earlier, books, which, covers, some, of, the, same, material, as, plato, s, republic, though, in, a, strikingly, different, way, burger, points, out, that, although, the, chapter, nominally, follows, the, same, path, methodos, as, previous, chapters, it, is, far, from, obvious, how, justice, is, to, be, understood, as, a, disposition, in, relation, to, a, passion, the, proposed, candidate, greed, pleonexia, would, seem, to, refer, rather, to, the, vice, of, injustice, and, the, single, opposite, of, the, virtue, in, other, words, justice, is, not, described, as, a, mean, between, two, extremes, he, distinguishes, such, states, of, character, from, science, a, science, concerns, a, subject, matter, in, which, knowledge, and, skill, aim, for, opposite, extremes, for, example, a, doctor, knows, the, science, of, health, and, uses, this, knowledge, to, heal, or, possibly, harm, patients, a, state, of, character, on, the, other, hand, goes, in, only, one, direction, having, a, courageous, state, of, character, does, not, make, it, easier, for, you, to, be, cowardly, nor, vice, versa, justice, he, says, is, a, state, of, character, that, is, possessed, by, people, who, engage, in, just, acts, from, just, desires, not, merely, the, science, of, knowing, theoretically, about, just, outcomes, or, processes, aristotle, claims, that, people, use, the, word, just, to, mean, either, law, abiding, or, lawful, nominos, or, equitable, or, fair, isos, he, envisions, an, ideal, legal, system, in, which, all, that, is, unfair, is, unlawful, but, not, all, that, is, unlawful, is, unfair, the, law, bids, us, practise, every, virtue, and, forbids, us, to, practise, any, vice, but, it, would, seem, that, to, be, a, good, man, is, not, in, every, case, the, same, thing, as, to, be, a, good, citizen, these, two, common, meanings, of, justice, coincide, only, to, the, extent, that, the, laws, are, themselves, good, something, only, lawmakers, can, ensure, aristotle, says, that, a, complete, virtue, encompasses, all, types, of, justice, and, indeed, all, types, of, excellence, of, character, while, a, partial, virtue, is, distinct, from, other, character, traits, for, example, a, soldier, who, flees, in, battle, might, be, exhibiting, cowardice, but, could, also, be, exhibiting, a, sort, of, injustice, e, g, not, wanting, to, equally, share, risks, with, other, soldiers, 1130b, to, understand, how, justice, aims, at, what, is, good, it, is, necessary, to, look, beyond, particular, good, or, bad, things, and, this, includes, considering, the, viewpoint, of, a, community, the, subject, of, aristotle, s, politics, alone, of, the, virtues, justice, looks, like, someone, else, s, good, an, argument, also, confronted, by, plato, in, his, republic, concerning, areas, in, which, law, abiding, behavior, might, conflict, with, fairness, aristotle, says, that, this, is, part, of, politics, aristotle, divides, particular, justice, further, into, two, parts, distribution, of, divisible, goods, and, rectification, in, private, transactions, the, first, relates, to, members, of, a, community, in, which, it, is, possible, for, one, person, to, have, more, or, less, of, a, good, than, another, person, the, second, concerns, transactions, that, have, resulted, in, an, imbalance, this, part, is, itself, divided, into, two, parts, voluntary, and, involuntary, involuntary, is, divided, into, furtive, and, violent, divisions, 1131a, aristotle, says, that, justice, involves, the, allocation, of, shares, of, goods, in, a, way, that, concerns, at, least, four, terms, namely, two, persons, for, whom, it, is, just, and, two, shares, which, are, just, v, 3, 5, 1131a, the, just, must, fall, between, what, is, too, much, and, what, is, too, little, and, what, is, just, requires, consideration, not, just, for, equality, but, for, the, relative, political, standing, of, the, parties, how, to, judge, the, mean, is, not, clear, because, if, the, persons, are, not, equal, they, will, not, have, equal, shares, it, is, when, equals, possess, or, are, allotted, unequal, shares, or, persons, not, equal, equal, shares, that, quarrels, and, complaints, arise, v, 3, 7, 1131a23, 24, aristotle, does, not, state, how, to, decide, who, deserves, more, or, less, political, systems, variously, define, fair, share, democrats, think, that, citizens, should, have, equal, shares, and, others, a, lesser, share, others, believers, in, oligarchy, aristocracy, etc, think, that, shares, ought, to, be, proportionate, to, wealth, fortune, of, birth, or, honor, distributive, justice, then, allocates, goods, according, to, that, rule, so, that, if, persons, a, and, b, stand, in, a, ratio, a, b, by, the, accepted, standard, shares, of, the, good, should, be, divvied, out, in, a, ratio, c, d, so, that, a, c, b, d, a, b, in, other, words, so, that, in, divvying, up, the, goods, the, relative, status, of, a, and, b, is, respected, v, 3, 13, the, second, part, of, particular, justice, is, restorative, it, concerns, voluntary, and, involuntary, transactions, between, people, and, looks, to, remediate, harm, caused, to, an, individual, emphasizing, justice, as, a, mean, he, says, that, men, require, a, judge, to, be, a, middle, term, or, medium, indeed, in, some, places, judges, are, called, mediators, for, they, think, that, if, they, get, the, mean, they, will, get, what, is, just, thus, the, just, is, a, sort, of, mean, inasmuch, as, the, judge, is, a, medium, between, the, litigants, to, restore, both, parties, to, this, just, mean, a, judge, must, redistribute, the, value, so, that, both, have, the, mean, this, rule, rectifies, both, voluntary, and, involuntary, transactions, finally, aristotle, turns, to, the, idea, that, retaliation, an, eye, for, an, eye, is, justice, an, idea, he, associates, with, the, pythagoreans, v, 5, one, problem, with, this, approach, is, that, it, ignores, different, reasons, for, committing, a, crime, for, example, a, crime, of, passion, or, ignorance, rather, than, from, defective, character, which, makes, a, critical, difference, when, determining, the, just, action, another, problem, is, that, it, does, not, preserve, the, original, proportions, of, the, parties, involved, an, eye, for, an, eye, is, blindly, equal, in, its, application, and, does, not, respect, the, status, of, the, parties, prior, to, the, transgression, for, example, if, an, officer, strikes, a, man, it, is, wrong, for, the, man, to, strike, him, back, and, if, a, man, strikes, an, officer, it, is, not, enough, for, the, officer, to, strike, him, but, he, ought, to, be, punished, as, well, v, 5, 4, aristotle, mentions, that, what, is, legal, is, not, the, same, as, what, is, just, political, justice, is, of, two, kinds, one, natural, the, other, conventional, aristotle, makes, a, point, that, recalls, debates, from, plato, s, republic, some, people, think, that, all, rules, of, justice, are, merely, conventional, because, whereas, a, law, of, nature, is, immutable, and, has, the, same, validity, everywhere, as, fire, burns, both, here, and, in, persia, rules, of, justice, are, seen, to, vary, v, 7, 2, aristotle, insists, that, justice, is, fixed, in, one, sense, and, variable, in, another, the, rules, of, justice, ordained, not, by, nature, but, by, man, are, not, the, same, in, all, places, since, forms, of, government, are, not, the, same, though, in, all, places, there, is, only, one, form, of, government, that, is, natural, namely, the, best, form, v, 7, 3, he, claimed, people, can, generally, see, which, types, of, rules, are, conventional, and, which, natural, and, he, felt, that, most, important, when, trying, to, judge, whether, someone, was, just, or, unjust, was, determining, whether, they, did, something, voluntarily, harmful, acts, can, be, categorized, as, the, discussion, of, voluntary, acts, in, this, section, and, that, in, book, iii, are, not, consistent, in, this, section, aristotle, calls, acts, done, in, and, from, ignorance, varieties, of, involuntary, acts, in, book, iii, he, says, such, acts, are, not, involuntary, except, for, those, that, both, were, done, from, ignorance, and, were, then, regretted, aristotle, next, discusses, epieikeia, usually, translated, as, equity, which, is, a, skillful, nuanced, corrective, to, by, the, books, justice, in, chapter, five, aristotle, gives, his, theory, for, the, origin, of, currency, as, a, medium, of, exchange, he, begins, from, an, assumption, that, in, voluntary, economic, transactions, the, people, in, the, transaction, begin, with, a, certain, relative, proportion, of, goods, and, end, with, the, same, relative, proportion, of, goods, if, this, does, not, occur, if, the, proportion, goes, out, of, balance, during, the, transaction, some, injustice, has, occurred, a, problem, with, this, is, that, it, is, difficult, for, people, to, exchange, things, that, are, actually, equal, such, that, they, preserve, this, proportion, imagine, a, cobbler, trying, to, exchange, shoes, for, a, house, for, example, clearly, no, house, builder, is, going, to, accept, a, single, pair, of, shoes, in, trade, or, a, pile, of, shoes, as, unwieldy, and, impractical, money, exists, says, aristotle, so, that, both, parties, in, a, transaction, can, weigh, their, contributions, on, a, common, scale, but, how, does, a, cobbler, for, instance, know, how, to, value, their, product, on, this, scale, aristotle, says, that, the, key, to, determining, this, quantitative, measure, of, value, is, chreia, this, has, often, been, translated, as, demand, by, translators, eager, to, suggest, that, aristotle, anticipated, the, modern, supply, and, demand, theory, of, price, but, could, also, be, translated, as, use, advantage, or, service, book, vi, of, the, nicomachean, ethics, is, identical, to, book, v, of, the, eudemian, ethics, if, a, virtue, is, the, habit, of, deliberately, choosing, a, virtuous, mean, how, is, that, mean, identified, and, how, is, that, translated, into, action, how, does, knowledge, become, choice, recognizing, the, mean, means, recognizing, the, correct, boundary, marker, horos, that, defines, the, frontier, of, the, mean, so, practical, ethics, having, a, good, character, requires, knowledge, aristotle, divides, the, soul, psuch, into, a, part, having, reason, the, intellect, and, parts, without, it, one, part, concerning, perception, or, sensation, and, another, with, appetite, or, desire, he, has, so, far, discussed, the, type, of, virtue, or, excellence, aret, of, the, appetitive, non, reasonable, part, that, of, the, character, thos, the, virtue, of, which, is, thik, aret, moral, virtue, now, he, intends, to, discuss, the, other, type, that, of, thought, dianoia, choice, happens, when, an, end, desired, by, the, appetitive, part, of, the, soul, combines, with, a, discovery, of, means, by, the, intellectual, part, of, the, soul, both, parts, of, the, soul, are, equal, partners, in, this, describing, it, as, the, desire, enlisting, the, intellect, or, the, intellect, guiding, the, desire, is, a, matter, of, convention, vi, 1, the, part, of, the, soul, with, reason, is, divided, into, two, parts, aristotle, says, that, if, recognition, depends, upon, likeness, and, kinship, between, the, things, being, recognized, and, the, recognizing, parts, of, the, soul, then, the, soul, grows, naturally, in, two, parts, 1139a10, aristotle, enumerates, five, types, of, hexis, stable, dispositions, of, the, soul, and, that, can, disclose, truth, 1139b15, 1142a, the, closing, chapters, of, book, vi, examine, phronesis, practical, judgement, practical, wisdom, or, prudence, more, closely, phronesis, concerns, practical, matters, and, matters, that, can, be, meaningfully, influenced, by, human, effort, syllogistic, reasoning, is, important, to, this, variety, of, reasoning, you, must, be, able, to, know, the, truth, about, the, universal, the, particular, and, the, syllogistic, process, that, enables, you, to, draw, a, conclusion, from, such, truths, vi, 7, phronesis, has, subcategories, for, different, spheres, of, human, life, vi, 8, people, who, apply, practical, wisdom, to, themselves, and, their, homes, are, esteemed, as, wise, but, people, who, apply, their, wisdom, to, other, people, s, lives, are, considered, meddlesome, aristotle, believes, that, such, busybodies, are, nonetheless, important, to, the, health, of, the, polis, vi, 8, phronesis, seems, to, require, experience, it, is, unlike, mathematics, that, a, talented, child, learn, aristotle, thinks, this, is, because, expertise, in, mathematics, requires, an, understanding, of, abstract, universals, while, practical, wisdom, requires, encounters, with, real, life, particulars, a, savant, can, grasp, a, mathematical, truth, immediately, but, may, be, skeptical, about, a, truth, of, practical, wisdom, and, to, need, to, see, that, truth, exemplified, in, real, life, examples, before, adopting, it, vi, 8, practical, wisdom, also, concerns, intuitively, grasped, particulars, somewhat, resembling, nous, which, is, intuition, about, universals, for, example, recognizing, a, triangle, without, having, to, count, the, sides, and, add, up, the, angles, is, using, practical, wisdom, in, this, way, vi, 8, people, with, practical, wisdom, deliberate, well, deliberation, is, a, sort, of, inquiry, into, what, would, be, a, good, course, of, action, it, is, not, understanding, is, like, deliberation, but, is, meant, to, comprehend, the, nature, of, a, thing, or, situation, which, can, then, aid, in, deliberation, understanding, aids, evaluating, the, knowledge, or, choices, of, others, vi, 10, gnome, is, notoriously, difficult, to, translate, it, is, a, deeper, holistic, understanding, of, a, situation, in, particular, it, is, what, allows, a, person, to, add, epieikeia, to, their, virtue, of, justice, aristotle, uses, nous, in, a, different, sense, to, tie, understanding, deliberation, and, gnome, together, this, use, of, nous, is, understanding, deliberation, and, gnome, that, is, integrated, and, practiced, it, aids, in, identifying, the, relevant, aspects, of, a, situation, and, the, relevant, hypotheses, that, enable, best, decisions, this, is, a, skill, that, can, only, be, acquired, through, experience, and, is, how, elders, earn, their, reputation, for, wisdom, vi, 11, aristotle, ends, his, investigation, by, comparing, the, importance, of, practical, wisdom, phronesis, and, philosophical, wisdom, sophia, although, aristotle, describes, sophia, as, the, more, serious, it, is, concerned, with, higher, things, he, mentions, the, earlier, philosophers, anaxagoras, and, thales, as, examples, proving, that, one, can, be, wise, having, both, knowledge, and, intellect, and, yet, lack, practical, judgement, he, describes, the, dependency, of, sophia, upon, phronesis, as, like, the, dependency, of, health, upon, medical, knowledge, wisdom, is, aimed, at, for, its, own, sake, like, health, a, necessary, component, of, that, most, complete, virtue, happiness, aristotle, closes, by, arguing, that, in, their, highest, form, virtues, all, exist, together, this, book, is, book, vi, in, eudemian, ethics, it, extends, previously, developed, discussions, especially, from, the, end, of, book, ii, in, relation, to, the, vice, of, akolasia, and, the, virtue, of, sophrosune, this, book, shows, signs, of, having, been, cobbled, together, from, multiple, fragmentary, sources, it, is, repetitive, aristotle, lists, three, impediments, to, virtue, these, stand, in, a, sort, of, hierarchy, according, to, aristotle, self, control, and, akrasia, incontinence, are, not, identical, with, virtue, and, vice, nor, yet, as, different, in, kind, from, them, temperance, is, distinct, from, self, control, both, because, self, control, could, be, used, to, restrain, good, desires, as, much, as, bad, ones, and, because, a, temperate, person, would, not, have, bad, desires, that, need, restraining, vii, 1, 2, another, way, of, stating, the, difference, between, lack, of, self, control, and, intemperance, is, that, intemperance, is, a, choice, and, a, habit, of, character, an, exercise, of, the, will, while, incontinence, is, contrary, to, choice, a, failure, of, will, by, analogy, the, incontinent, person, is, like, a, city, that, has, good, laws, on, the, books, but, that, doesn, t, enforce, them, the, intemperate, person, is, like, a, city, with, bad, laws, vii, 10, aristotle, reviews, notions, about, self, control, including, one, he, associates, with, socrates, vii, 1, 2, according, to, aristotle, socrates, argued, that, incontinent, behavior, must, be, a, result, of, ignorance, as, people, only, choose, what, they, think, to, be, good, it, s, not, that, the, unrestrained, person, does, things, that, they, know, to, be, bad, disregarding, their, knowledge, under, the, influence, of, passion, but, that, they, are, ignorant, about, what, is, good, and, bad, aristotle, says, at, first, that, this, view, plainly, contradicts, the, observed, facts, but, comes, to, conclude, that, the, position, that, socrates, sought, to, establish, actually, seems, to, result, his, way, of, accommodating, socrates, relies, on, syllogistic, reasoning, aristotle, suggests, that, an, incontinent, person, has, competing, universal, premises, for, example, would, be, unjust, and, would, satisfy, my, sensual, desire, when, they, then, encounter, a, particular, is, an, example, of, the, universal, premise, that, has, a, sensual, payoff, associated, with, it, crowds, out, the, one, that, does, not, when, it, comes, time, for, the, incontinent, person, to, choose, a, course, of, action, would, satisfy, my, sensual, desire, i, shall, the, incontinent, person, therefore, remains, in, ignorance, about, what, they, should, be, able, to, know, would, be, unjust, vii, 3, aristotle, says, that, someone, who, lacks, self, control, is, typically, influenced, either, by, necessary, pleasures, or, pains, like, those, associated, with, food, and, sex, or, by, more, supererogatory, pleasures, and, pains, like, those, associated, with, victory, honor, or, wealth, lack, of, self, control, in, the, first, case, is, simple, lack, of, self, control, and, is, a, sort, of, vice, in, a, similar, domain, to, intemperance, lack, of, self, control, in, the, second, case, is, somewhat, different, pursuing, good, things, but, in, an, excessive, unrestrained, way, vii, 4, some, have, unusual, desires, or, aversions, after, they, were, victimized, as, children, or, experience, some, sort, of, psychopathology, or, other, malady, aristotle, says, that, every, sort, of, senselessness, or, cowardice, or, dissipation, or, harshness, that, goes, to, excess, is, either, animal, like, or, disease, like, for, aristotle, akrasia, incontinence, is, distinct, from, animal, like, behavior, because, it, is, specific, to, humans, and, involves, rational, thinking, even, though, the, conclusions, are, not, put, into, practice, someone, who, behaves, in, a, purely, animal, like, way, is, not, acting, based, upon, conscious, choice, returning, to, the, question, of, anger, thumos, aristotle, distinguishes, it, from, desires, because, he, says, it, listens, to, reason, but, often, hears, incorrectly, he, contrasts, this, with, desire, which, does, not, listen, to, reason, someone, overcome, by, anger, is, conquered, by, flawed, crude, reason, but, at, least, by, an, argument, someone, overcome, by, desire, is, conquered, by, desire, alone, vii, 5, he, also, says, that, anger, is, more, natural, and, less, blameworthy, than, desire, for, excessive, unnecessary, pleasure, vii, 5, acts, from, anger, are, more, likely, to, be, sudden, and, unpremeditated, while, those, motivated, by, desire, are, more, likely, to, be, plotted, furthermore, acts, of, hubris, never, result, from, anger, but, always, have, a, connection, to, pleasure, seeking, whereas, angry, people, act, from, often, regretted, pain, vii, 5, the, two, ways, that, people, lose, mastery, of, their, own, actions, and, do, not, act, according, to, their, own, deliberations, include, excitability, where, a, person, does, follows, their, imagination, and, that, of, a, weak, person, who, has, thought, things, through, but, is, carried, away, by, passion, vii, 6, 1150b, nevertheless, it, is, better, to, have, akrasia, than, the, vice, of, akolasia, in, which, intemperate, acts, are, chosen, for, their, own, sake, people, with, such, a, vice, do, not, even, know, they, are, wrong, and, feel, no, regrets, these, are, less, curable, vii, 6, 7, aristotle, compares, self, control, resisting, the, temptation, of, the, pleasant, with, endurance, resisting, the, temptation, of, the, unpleasant, and, he, describes, the, nebbish, who, wilts, in, the, face, of, moderate, displeasure, as, a, sort, of, counterpart, to, the, person, without, self, control, vii, 7, finally, aristotle, addresses, questions, raised, earlier, aristotle, discusses, pleasure, in, two, separate, parts, of, the, nicomachean, ethics, vii, 11, 14, and, x, 1, 5, plato, discussed, similar, themes, in, several, dialogues, including, the, republic, and, the, philebus, and, gorgias, he, begins, this, section, by, rebutting, the, arguments, of, speusippus, who, opposed, the, idea, that, pleasure, is, a, or, the, good, according, to, aristotle, s, way, of, analyzing, causation, a, good, or, bad, thing, can, either, be, an, activity, energeia, or, a, stable, disposition, hexis, the, pleasure, that, comes, from, returning, to, a, natural, hexis, are, accidental, and, not, natural, for, example, the, temporary, pleasure, that, can, come, from, a, bitter, taste, things, that, are, pleasant, by, nature, are, activities, that, are, pleasant, in, themselves, and, involve, no, pain, or, desire, the, example, aristotle, gives, is, contemplation, such, pleasures, are, activities, that, are, ends, themselves, not, just, processes, of, coming, into, being, aimed, at, some, higher, end, 1153a, pain, is, clearly, bad, either, in, a, simple, sense, or, as, an, impediment, aristotle, argues, that, this, makes, it, clear, that, pleasure, is, good, he, rejects, the, argument, of, speusippus, that, pleasure, and, pain, are, different, only, in, degree, because, this, still, does, not, make, pleasure, bad, nor, or, imply, that, some, pleasure, is, not, the, best, thing, aristotle, points, out, that, if, pleasure, is, not, good, then, a, happy, eudaimon, person, will, not, have, a, more, pleasant, life, than, another, and, would, have, no, reason, to, avoid, pain, 1153b, while, any, level, of, pain, is, bad, it, is, only, excessive, bodily, pleasures, that, are, bad, aristotle, considers, why, people, are, so, attracted, to, bodily, pleasures, apart, from, depravities, and, cases, where, a, bodily, pleasure, comes, from, returning, to, health, aristotle, asserts, a, more, complex, metaphysical, reason, which, is, that, for, humans, change, is, sweet, but, only, because, of, some, disequilibrium, which, is, because, part, of, every, human, is, perishable, and, a, nature, that, needs, change, is, not, simple, nor, good, god, in, contrast, enjoys, a, single, simple, pleasure, perpetually, book, ii, aristotle, discussed, friendship, here, sachs, discusses, aristotle, s, ideas, about, friendship, philia, the, treatment, of, friendship, in, the, nicomachean, ethics, is, longer, than, that, of, any, other, topic, and, comes, just, before, the, conclusion, of, the, whole, inquiry, books, viii, and, ix, are, continuous, but, the, break, makes, the, first, book, focus, on, friendship, as, a, small, version, of, the, political, community, in, which, a, bond, stronger, than, justice, holds, people, together, while, the, second, treats, it, as, an, expansion, of, the, self, through, which, all, one, s, powers, can, approach, their, highest, development, friendship, thus, provides, a, bridge, between, the, virtues, of, character, and, those, of, intellect, friendship, says, aristotle, is, a, virtue, or, at, any, rate, it, implies, virtue, and, it, is, necessary, for, eudaimonia, indeed, if, you, had, everything, else, but, had, no, genuine, friends, life, would, not, be, worth, living, ix, 9, it, is, also, an, important, consideration, in, justice, and, politics, as, friendship, is, what, holds, states, together, viii, 1, 1155a, friendship, exists, when, two, people, each, wish, for, each, other, s, good, and, are, both, aware, of, this, mutual, relationship, viii, 2, the, two, sorts, of, friendship, are, friends, who, love, each, other, because, and, to, the, extent, that, they, are, useful, or, pleasant, to, each, other, and, friends, who, love, each, other, because, they, are, good, and, virtuous, and, wish, good, things, for, the, other, for, the, other, s, sake, the, first, sort, is, inferior, to, the, last, because, of, the, motive, friendships, of, utility, and, pleasure, do, not, regard, friends, as, people, but, for, what, they, can, offer, and, also, because, they, are, more, fragile, likely, to, disintegrate, if, the, utility, or, pleasure, goes, away, viii, 3, 1155b, friendships, of, utility, are, relationships, formed, without, regard, to, the, other, person, these, friendships, are, grouped, along, with, family, ties, and, of, hospitality, to, foreigners, types, of, friendships, aristotle, associates, with, older, people, viii, 3, 1156a, friendships, of, pleasure, are, based, on, fleeting, emotions, and, are, more, associated, with, young, people, while, such, friends, like, to, be, together, such, friendships, end, whenever, people, no, longer, enjoy, the, shared, activity, or, can, no, longer, participate, in, it, together, viii, 3, 1156a, friendships, based, upon, what, is, good, are, the, perfect, form, of, friendship, in, which, both, friends, enjoy, each, other, s, virtue, as, long, as, both, friends, maintain, a, virtuous, character, the, relationship, will, endure, and, be, pleasant, useful, and, good, for, both, parties, since, the, motive, behind, it, is, care, for, the, friend, such, relationships, are, rare, because, good, people, are, rare, and, bad, people, do, not, take, pleasure, in, each, other, viii, 3, 1156b, aristotle, suggests, that, although, the, word, friend, is, used, in, these, different, ways, it, is, best, to, say, that, friendships, of, pleasure, and, usefulness, are, only, analogous, to, real, friendships, it, is, sometimes, possible, that, at, least, in, the, case, of, people, who, are, friends, for, pleasure, familiarity, will, lead, to, a, better, friendship, as, the, friends, learn, to, admire, each, other, s, characters, perfect, friendship, may, be, incidentally, utilitarian, it, is, in, fact, pleasant, and, useful, but, is, not, primarily, so, it, requires, trust, and, it, is, difficult, to, trust, someone, who, is, not, virtuous, the, lesser, utilitarian, species, of, friendship, is, also, worthy, of, attention, but, it, is, only, a, shadow, of, the, real, thing, viii, 3, 1157a, genuine, friendship, seems, to, require, regular, in, person, encounters, viii, 4, ix, 12, friend, must, be, amiable, and, enjoy, spending, time, together, though, these, are, not, sufficient, ix, 5, it, is, possible, to, have, many, utilitarian, friendships, but, only, a, few, true, friends, viii, 5, ix, 10, friendships, between, people, of, differing, status, can, present, difficulties, people, in, authority, sometimes, have, friends, quick, witted, of, the, pleasurable, and, obedient, friends, of, the, useful, sort, but, the, quick, witted, ones, may, not, be, obedient, and, obedient, ones, tend, not, to, be, quick, witted, rarely, are, the, two, united, good, virtuous, people, tend, not, to, make, friends, with, people, above, their, station, except, with, rare, examples, who, are, also, exceptionally, good, and, virtuous, viii, 6, however, a, sort, of, friendship, between, unequals, is, possible, such, as, friendship, between, a, father, and, son, rulers, can, have, a, friendly, regard, for, their, subjects, in, such, cases, friendship, is, a, sort, of, respect, that, should, be, apportioned, like, justice, according, to, the, relative, status, of, the, parties, a, son, should, respect, the, father, more, than, the, father, respects, the, son, subjects, should, love, their, king, more, than, the, king, loves, any, subject, etc, this, is, another, way, such, friendship, differs, from, genuine, friendship, in, which, love, and, respect, is, equal, regardless, of, status, and, in, which, loving, rather, than, being, loved, is, valued, this, makes, it, difficult, for, differently, situated, people, to, become, genuine, friends, or, for, a, genuine, friendship, to, survive, a, rebalancing, in, status, between, the, friends, viii, 7, 13, in, friendships, between, unequals, the, superior, person, thinks, their, status, should, qualify, them, for, a, superior, share, of, its, benefits, the, inferior, person, thinks, that, they, should, be, able, to, expect, more, benefits, as, they, have, less, to, give, aristotle, thinks, one, way, to, resolve, this, is, to, allow, the, inferior, person, receives, a, larger, share, of, actual, goods, and, assistance, while, the, superior, person, gains, the, larger, share, of, honor, from, such, beneficence, so, they, both, benefit, this, is, true, of, the, polis, in, general, some, people, contribute, little, and, take, much, other, people, contribute, much, and, take, little, but, are, repaid, in, honor, this, is, how, mortals, behave, towards, gods, and, children, towards, parents, viii, 14, the, relationship, between, benefactors, and, those, they, benefit, also, has, a, paradoxical, friendship, dynamic, the, giver, may, enjoy, the, gift, giving, more, than, the, recipient, enjoys, the, gift, and, the, giver, may, be, more, fond, of, the, recipient, than, vice, versa, ix, 7, friendship, is, a, form, of, love, best, exhibited, in, the, giving, rather, than, in, the, receiving, viii, 8, associations, and, friendships, bind, the, polis, together, viii, 9, 1160a, different, relationships, can, be, compared, to, the, different, types, of, constitution, according, to, the, classification, system, aristotle, explains, in, his, politics, monarchy, tyranny, aristocracy, oligarchy, timocracy, and, democracy, 1161a, the, difference, between, the, good, and, bad, types, has, to, do, with, how, virtuous, or, self, serving, are, those, in, power, a, monarch, cares, for, his, kingdom, and, subjects, a, tyrant, for, himself, an, aristocracy, looks, out, for, the, good, of, the, polis, an, oligarchy, tries, to, accrue, more, power, and, wealth, for, itself, a, timocracy, has, the, good, of, everyone, in, mind, a, democracy, tries, to, rob, the, minority, to, feed, the, majority, viii, 10, ix, 6, similarly, a, good, friendship, between, a, man, and, his, wife, in, a, patriarchy, is, like, the, friendship, between, an, aristocracy, and, the, commoners, a, good, friendship, between, brothers, is, like, the, friendship, between, timocrats, viii, 11, the, friendship, between, relatives, is, closer, than, that, of, fellow, citizens, and, the, closeness, of, such, friendship, is, related, to, the, closeness, of, kinship, as, well, as, to, their, closeness, in, age, and, the, extent, to, which, they, have, been, brought, up, together, the, friendship, of, parents, and, children, is, a, special, sort, akin, to, the, relationship, between, the, gods, and, mortals, the, friendship, between, husband, and, wife, is, natural, and, fundamental, even, more, so, than, that, of, the, tendency, of, people, to, come, together, in, communities, marriages, may, be, utilitarian, friendships, or, genuine, ones, viii, 12, genuine, friends, don, t, have, reason, to, complain, about, the, justice, of, their, friendship, because, if, they, love, more, than, they, are, loved, an, imbalance, is, ok, in, utilitarian, friendships, complaints, over, whether, one, of, friend, is, contributing, to, the, friendship, and, each, friend, is, eager, to, give, less, and, get, more, viii, 13, these, sorts, of, conflicts, are, not, best, handled, by, a, model, of, objective, justice, but, in, such, cases, the, value, of, favors, received, and, therefore, how, much, return, is, due, ought, generally, to, be, determined, by, the, recipient, ix, 1, if, obligations, to, friends, conflict, with, each, other, or, with, other, obligations, no, rules, describe, how, to, resolve, them, but, heuristics, may, help, repay, debts, prefer, kin, to, non, kin, prefer, friends, to, others, respect, elders, etc, a, right, answer, might, be, available, but, no, universal, formula, applies, ix, 2, utilitarian, friendships, are, expected, to, last, only, as, long, as, the, utility, genuine, friendships, can, also, end, for, instance, if, one, of, the, parties, stops, considering, it, a, genuine, friendship, or, if, one, of, friend, descends, into, vice, or, ascends, beyond, the, other, in, virtue, ix, 3, a, virtuous, person, seeks, friendships, that, resemble, the, relationship, he, has, with, himself, a, virtuous, person, has, integrity, and, wishes, what, is, actually, good, for, himself, for, his, own, sake, in, this, way, he, is, like, a, genuine, friend, to, himself, for, a, friend, wishes, for, a, friend, what, is, good, for, the, friend, vicious, people, on, the, other, hand, are, in, conflict, even, with, themselves, their, appetites, conflict, with, their, reason, and, so, forth, and, so, they, lack, a, foundation, on, which, to, build, genuine, friendships, ix, 4, enlightened, self, regard, is, an, important, prerequisite, for, loving, others, but, the, sort, of, self, love, practiced, by, the, intemperate, is, worse, than, useless, for, this, reason, a, good, person, ought, to, be, encouraged, in, self, love, while, a, wicked, person, ought, to, be, discouraged, in, it, since, he, does, not, know, how, to, do, so, properly, ix, 8, in, times, of, bad, fortune, it, is, good, to, have, helpful, friends, in, times, of, good, fortune, it, is, even, better, to, be, a, helpful, friend, friends, should, not, hesitate, to, aid, each, other, even, unasked, but, should, avoid, becoming, the, objects, of, a, friends, kindness, ix, 11, aristotle, discusses, pleasure, throughout, the, ethics, but, gives, it, a, more, focused, and, theoretical, treatment, in, book, x, he, starts, by, questioning, the, rule, advanced, in, the, more, approximate, early, sections, by, which, people, think, pleasure, should, be, avoided, if, not, because, it, is, simply, bad, because, people, tend, too, much, towards, pleasure, seeking, he, argues, that, people, s, actions, show, this, to, not, be, what, they, really, believe, but, is, a, noble, lie, taught, for, its, supposed, salutary, effects, x, 1, he, reviews, arguments, of, previous, philosophers, including, eudoxus, who, considered, pleasure, to, be, the, good, and, plato, and, speusippos, who, did, not, to, advance, his, own, middle, way, argument, pleasure, is, a, good, pursued, for, its, own, sake, even, if, it, is, not, the, good, in, a, platonic, or, ultimate, sense, x, 2, 3, even, if, pleasure, and, pain, are, entirely, orthogonal, to, virtue, and, vice, because, these, sensations, are, powerful, motivators, particularly, in, the, young, it, is, important, for, the, ethicist, to, consider, them, x, 1, to, define, what, pleasure, is, aristotle, applies, his, theory, of, motion, kin, sis, as, an, energeia, as, explained, in, his, physics, and, metaphysics, in, this, approach, pleasure, is, not, a, movement, or, kin, sis, because, unlike, the, movement, of, walking, across, a, room, or, building, a, house, it, has, no, completion, endpoint, it, is, more, like, seeing, which, is, either, happening, in, a, complete, way, or, not, happening, each, moment, of, pleasurable, consciousness, is, a, perfect, whole, a, sense, perception, like, sight, is, in, perfect, activity, teleia, energeia, when, it, is, in, its, best, conditions, and, directed, at, the, best, objects, any, sense, in, such, perfect, activity, produces, pleasure, similarly, thinking, dianoia, and, contemplation, the, ria, have, their, associated, pleasures, but, seeing, for, example, is, a, whole, as, is, the, associated, pleasure, pleasure, completes, the, seeing, or, thinking, in, a, way, but, as, an, additional, supervening, activity, that, crowns, it, rather, than, as, something, necessary, to, it, x, 4, why, doesn, t, pleasure, last, why, does, it, fade, as, if, from, fatigue, aristotle, proposes, that, this, is, because, pleasure, accompanies, activity, and, no, activity, can, be, continued, indefinitely, without, fatigue, and, because, sensation, requires, some, novelty, and, any, pleasurable, stimulus, loses, its, appeal, when, repeated, too, often, life, is, an, activity, energeia, made, up, of, many, activities, such, as, music, thinking, and, contemplation, and, pleasure, brings, supervening, completion, to, each, of, these, leading, to, fulfillment, and, a, life, worth, living, aristotle, says, the, question, of, whether, life, is, for, pleasure, or, pleasure, is, for, the, sake, of, living, for, the, two, activities, seem, irreversibly, intertwined, x, 4, 1175a10, 20, different, activities, sense, perceptions, thinking, contemplating, bring, different, kinds, of, pleasure, and, these, pleasures, intensify, the, activities, thus, for, each, activity, has, its, own, proper, pleasure, x, 5, 6, for, example, a, flute, player, gets, better, at, playing, while, getting, more, pleasure, from, it, but, these, pleasures, and, their, associated, activities, may, impede, each, other, just, as, a, flute, player, cannot, participate, in, an, argument, while, playing, this, raises, the, question, of, which, pleasures, are, to, be, pursued, some, pleasures, are, more, beautiful, and, some, are, more, base, or, corrupt, the, pleasure, a, virtuous, person, feels, from, practicing, virtue, is, a, good, pleasure, the, pleasure, a, vicious, person, feels, from, practicing, vice, less, so, such, pleasures, hardly, deserve, the, name, x, 5, aristotle, argues, that, each, type, of, animal, has, pleasures, appropriate, to, it, and, in, the, same, way, people, differ, in, the, pleasures, most, suitable, to, them, aristotle, proposes, that, the, person, of, serious, moral, stature, is, the, appropriate, standard, x, 5, 1176a, finally, aristotle, returns, to, eudaimonia, the, aim, of, the, whole, ethics, according, to, the, book, i, definition, it, is, an, activity, good, in, and, of, itself, and, chosen, for, its, own, sake, not, instrumentally, aristotle, argued, that, virtues, fit, this, definition, but, perhaps, recreational, activity, also, fits, the, bill, a, tennis, game, for, example, may, be, played, for, its, own, sake, aristotle, thinks, that, this, trivializes, eudaimonia, anybody, can, enjoy, recreation, even, a, slave, and, no, one, would, want, to, be, a, slave, he, believes, recreation, is, not, an, end, in, itself, but, a, way, of, relaxing, in, preparation, for, or, to, recover, from, more, noble, activity, in, other, words, it, is, instrumental, x, 6, aristotle, says, that, if, perfect, eudaimonia, is, activity, in, accordance, with, the, highest, virtue, then, this, highest, virtue, must, be, the, virtue, of, the, highest, part, of, the, soul, he, says, this, must, be, the, intellect, nous, or, whatever, else, it, be, that, is, thought, to, rule, and, lead, us, by, nature, and, to, have, cognizance, of, what, is, noble, and, divine, this, highest, activity, aristotle, says, must, be, philosophical, contemplation, energeia, the, r, tik, this, is, also, the, most, sustainable, pleasant, self, sufficient, activity, and, it, is, chosen, for, its, own, sake, to, achieve, it, means, to, live, in, accordance, with, something, immortal, and, divine, which, is, within, humans, and, so, far, as, we, can, make, ourselves, immortal, and, strain, every, nerve, to, live, in, accordance, with, the, best, thing, in, us, according, to, aristotle, contemplation, is, the, only, type, of, happy, activity, in, which, the, gods, might, be, imagined, to, engage, in, the, intellect, is, the, true, self, and, this, type, of, happiness, is, the, happiness, most, suited, to, humans, in, that, only, humans, possess, both, happiness, eudaimonia, and, the, intellect, nous, aristotle, also, claims, that, compared, to, other, virtues, contemplation, requires, the, least, in, terms, of, possessions, and, allows, the, most, self, reliance, though, it, is, true, that, being, a, man, and, living, in, the, society, of, others, he, chooses, to, engage, in, virtuous, action, and, so, will, need, external, goods, to, carry, on, his, life, as, a, human, being, what, distinguishes, humans, from, other, animals, is, that, we, reason, this, is, a, hint, to, our, purpose, and, that, in, turn, tells, us, how, to, fulfill, our, eudaimonia, that, which, is, proper, to, each, thing, is, by, nature, best, and, most, pleasant, for, each, thing, for, man, therefore, the, life, according, to, reason, is, best, and, pleasantest, since, reason, more, than, anything, else, is, man, this, life, therefore, is, also, the, happiest, indeed, eudaimonia, itself, is, something, peculiar, to, human, beings, and, this, is, fundamental, happiness, extends, just, so, far, as, contemplation, does, and, those, to, whom, contemplation, more, fully, belongs, are, more, truly, happy, not, as, a, mere, concomitant, but, in, virtue, of, the, contemplation, for, this, is, in, itself, precious, happiness, therefore, must, be, some, form, of, contemplation, aristotle, reiterates, that, the, ethics, has, not, reached, its, aim, if, it, has, no, effect, in, practice, the, point, is, not, just, to, learn, how, to, live, but, to, actually, live, that, way, theories, are, not, enough, the, practice, of, virtue, requires, good, education, and, habituation, from, an, early, age, young, people, otherwise, do, not, get, to, experience, the, highest, forms, of, pleasure, and, are, distracted, by, the, easiest, ones, while, parents, often, attempt, this, sort, of, education, it, is, critical, that, the, community, enact, good, laws, concerning, this, need, for, good, laws, and, education, aristotle, says, he, seeks, to, address, an, eternal, problem, unlike, in, medical, science, theoreticians, of, happiness, and, teachers, of, virtue, such, as, sophists, never, have, practical, experience, themselves, while, good, parents, and, lawmakers, have, never, developed, a, scientific, approach, to, analyzing, what, the, best, laws, are, furthermore, few, lawmakers, perhaps, only, the, spartans, made, education, a, focus, of, law, making, as, they, should, education, needs, to, be, more, like, medicine, with, both, practice, and, theory, and, this, requires, a, new, approach, to, studying, politics, such, study, should, he, says, help, even, in, communities, where, the, laws, are, not, good, and, the, parents, need, to, try, to, create, the, right, habits, in, young, people, without, help, from, lawmakers, aristotle, closes, the, nicomachean, ethics, therefore, by, highlighting, his, sequel, politics, x, 9, however, politics, as, we, have, it, today, is, significantly, different, from, the, promised, discussion, of, politics, aristotle, alludes, to, there, the, eudemian, ethics, is, sometimes, considered, to, be, a, later, commentary, or, paraphrase, of, the, nicomachean, ethics, the, magna, moralia, is, usually, also, interpreted, as, a, post, aristotle, synthesis, of, aristotelian, ethics, including, the, nicomachean, and, eudemian, although, it, is, sometimes, also, attributed, to, aristotle, parts, of, a, 2nd, century, ce, commentary, about, the, nicomachean, ethics, by, aspasius, exist, this, is, the, earliest, extant, commentary, on, any, of, aristotle, s, works, and, is, notable, because, aspasius, was, a, peripatetic, that, is, of, the, aristotelian, scholastic, tradition, aristotelian, ethics, was, superseded, by, epicureanism, and, stoicism, in, greek, philosophy, in, the, west, it, did, not, regain, interest, until, the, 12th, century, when, the, nicomachean, ethics, and, averroes, s, 12th, century, commentary, on, it, was, rediscovered, thomas, aquinas, called, aristotle, the, philosopher, and, published, a, separate, commentary, on, the, nicomachean, ethics, as, well, as, incorporating, or, responding, to, many, of, its, arguments, in, his, summa, theologica, domenico, da, piacenza, relied, on, aristotle, s, description, of, the, pleasures, of, motion, in, book, x, as, an, authority, in, his, 15th, century, treatise, on, dance, principles, one, of, the, earliest, written, documents, on, the, formal, principles, of, dance, that, eventually, become, classical, ballet, da, piacenza, who, taught, that, the, ideal, smoothness, of, dance, movement, could, only, be, attained, by, a, balance, of, qualities, relied, on, aristotelian, philosophical, concepts, of, movement, measure, and, memory, to, extol, dance, on, moral, grounds, as, a, virtue, in, g, e, m, anscombe, s, 1958, essay, modern, moral, philosophy, she, noted, that, ethical, philosophy, had, diverged, so, much, since, aristotle, that, people, who, use, modern, ethical, notions, when, discussing, aristotle, s, ethics, constantly, feel, like, someone, whose, jaws, have, somehow, got, out, of, alignment, the, teeth, don, t, come, together, in, a, proper, bite, modern, philosophy, had, she, believed, discarded, aristotle, s, human, telos, and, in, its, skepticism, toward, divine, law, as, an, adequate, substitute, and, lost, a, way, of, making, the, study, of, ethics, meaningful, as, a, result, modern, moral, philosophy, was, floundering, unable, to, recall, how, its, intuitions, of, good, and, bad, could, possibly, be, grounded, in, facts, she, suggested, that, it, might, be, possible, to, backtrack, and, recover, an, aristotelian, ethics, but, that, to, do, this, would, require, updating, some, of, aristotle, s, metaphysical, and, psychological, assumptions, that, are, no, longer, plausible, philosophically, there, is, a, huge, gap, at, present, unfillable, as, far, as, we, are, concerned, which, needs, to, be, filled, by, an, account, of, human, nature, human, action, the, type, of, characteristic, a, virtue, is, and, above, all, of, human, flourishing, the, modern, virtue, ethics, revival, has, taken, up, this, challenge, notably, alasdair, macintyre, in, after, virtue, 1981, explicitly, defended, an, aristotelian, ethics, against, modern, ethical, theories, he, claimed, that, nietzsche, had, shown, the, varieties, of, modern, moral, philosophy, to, be, hollow, and, had, effectively, refuted, them, but, he, says, nietzsche, s, refutations, do, not, apply, to, the, quite, distinctive, kind, of, morality, found, in, aristotelian, ethics, so, to, recover, ethics, the, aristotelian, tradition, can, be, restated, in, a, way, that, restores, intelligibility, and, rationality, to, our, moral, and, social, attitudes, and, commitments
