is, derived, from, the, word, ball, which, in, turn, originates, from, the, latin, word, ballare, which, means, to, dance, a, ball, room, being, a, large, room, specially, designed, for, such, dances, in, times, past, ballroom, dancing, was, social, dancing, for, the, privileged, leaving, folk, dancing, for, the, lower, classes, these, boundaries, have, since, become, blurred, the, definition, of, ballroom, dance, also, depends, on, the, era, balls, have, featured, popular, dances, of, the, day, such, as, the, minuet, quadrille, polonaise, polka, mazurka, and, others, which, are, now, considered, to, be, historical, dances, the, first, authoritative, knowledge, of, the, earliest, ballroom, dances, was, recorded, toward, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, when, jehan, tabourot, under, the, pen, name, thoinot, arbeau, published, in, 1588, his, orch, sographie, a, study, of, late, 16th, century, french, renaissance, social, dance, among, the, dances, described, were, the, solemn, basse, danse, the, livelier, branle, pavane, and, the, galliarde, which, shakespeare, called, the, cinq, pace, as, it, was, made, of, five, steps, in, 1650, the, minuet, originally, a, peasant, dance, of, poitou, was, introduced, into, paris, and, set, to, music, by, jean, baptiste, lully, and, danced, by, the, king, louis, xiv, in, public, the, minuet, dominated, the, ballroom, from, that, time, until, the, close, of, the, 18th, century, toward, the, later, half, of, the, 17th, century, louis, xiv, founded, his, acad, mie, royale, de, musique, et, de, danse, where, specific, rules, for, the, execution, of, every, dance, and, the, five, positions, of, the, feet, were, formulated, for, the, first, time, by, members, of, the, acad, mie, eventually, the, first, definite, cleavage, between, ballet, and, ballroom, came, when, professional, dancers, appeared, in, the, ballets, and, the, ballets, left, the, court, and, went, to, the, stage, ballet, technique, such, as, the, turned, out, positions, of, the, feet, however, lingered, for, over, two, centuries, and, past, the, end, of, the, victoria, era, the, waltz, with, its, modern, hold, took, root, in, england, in, about, 1812, in, 1819, carl, maria, von, weber, wrote, invitation, to, the, dance, which, marked, the, adoption, of, the, waltz, form, into, the, sphere, of, absolute, music, the, dance, was, initially, met, with, tremendous, opposition, due, to, the, semblance, of, impropriety, associated, with, the, closed, hold, though, the, stance, gradually, softened, in, the, 1840s, several, new, dances, made, their, appearance, in, the, ballroom, including, the, polka, mazurka, and, the, schottische, in, the, meantime, a, strong, tendency, emerged, to, drop, all, decorative, steps, such, as, entrechats, and, ronds, de, jambes, that, had, found, a, place, in, the, quadrilles, and, other, dances, modern, ballroom, dance, has, its, roots, early, in, the, 20th, century, when, several, different, things, happened, more, or, less, at, the, same, time, the, first, was, a, movement, away, from, the, sequence, dances, towards, dances, where, the, couples, moved, independently, this, had, been, pre, figured, by, the, waltz, which, had, already, made, this, transition, the, second, was, a, wave, of, popular, music, such, as, jazz, since, dance, is, to, a, large, extent, tied, to, music, this, led, to, a, burst, of, newly, invented, dances, there, were, many, dance, crazes, in, the, period, 1910, 1930, the, third, event, was, a, concerted, effort, to, transform, some, of, the, dance, crazes, into, dances, which, could, be, taught, to, a, wider, dance, public, in, the, u, s, and, europe, here, vernon, and, irene, castle, were, important, and, so, was, a, generation, of, english, dancers, in, the, 1920s, including, josephine, bradley, and, victor, silvester, these, professionals, analysed, codified, published, and, taught, a, number, of, standard, dances, it, was, essential, if, popular, dance, was, to, flourish, for, dancers, to, have, some, basic, movements, they, could, confidently, perform, with, any, partner, they, might, meet, here, the, huge, arthur, murray, organisation, in, america, and, the, dance, societies, in, england, such, as, the, imperial, society, of, teachers, of, dancing, were, highly, influential, finally, much, of, this, happened, during, and, after, a, period, of, world, war, and, the, effect, of, such, a, conflict, in, dissolving, older, social, customs, was, considerable, later, in, the, 1930s, the, on, screen, dance, pairing, of, fred, astaire, and, ginger, rogers, influenced, all, forms, of, dance, in, the, u, s, and, elsewhere, although, both, actors, had, separate, careers, their, filmed, dance, sequences, together, which, included, portrayals, of, the, castles, have, reached, iconic, status, much, of, astaire, and, rogers, work, portrayed, social, dancing, although, the, performances, were, highly, choreographed, often, by, astaire, or, hermes, pan, and, meticulously, staged, and, rehearsed, competitions, sometimes, referred, to, as, dancesport, range, from, world, championships, regulated, by,
