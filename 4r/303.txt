https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(music)
in, music, a, chord, is, a, group, of, two, or, more, notes, played, simultaneously, typically, consisting, of, a, root, note, a, third, and, a, fifth, chords, are, the, building, blocks, of, harmony, and, form, the, harmonic, foundation, of, a, piece, of, music, they, can, be, major, minor, diminished, augmented, or, extended, depending, on, the, intervals, between, the, notes, and, their, arrangement, chords, provide, the, harmonic, support, and, coloration, that, accompany, melodies, and, contribute, to, the, overall, sound, and, mood, of, a, musical, composition, for, many, practical, and, theoretical, purposes, arpeggios, and, other, types, of, broken, chords, in, which, the, chord, tones, are, not, sounded, simultaneously, may, also, be, considered, as, chords, in, the, right, musical, context, in, tonal, western, classical, music, music, with, a, tonic, key, or, home, key, the, most, frequently, encountered, chords, are, triads, so, called, because, they, consist, of, three, distinct, notes, the, root, note, and, intervals, of, a, third, and, a, fifth, above, the, root, note, chords, with, more, than, three, notes, include, added, tone, chords, extended, chords, and, tone, clusters, which, are, used, in, contemporary, classical, music, jazz, and, almost, any, other, genre, a, series, of, chords, is, called, a, chord, progression, one, example, of, a, widely, used, chord, progression, in, western, traditional, music, and, blues, is, the, 12, bar, blues, progression, although, any, chord, may, in, principle, be, followed, by, any, other, chord, certain, patterns, of, chords, are, more, common, in, western, music, and, some, patterns, have, been, accepted, as, establishing, the, key, tonic, note, in, common, practice, harmony, notably, the, resolution, of, a, dominant, chord, to, a, tonic, chord, to, describe, this, western, music, theory, has, developed, the, practice, of, numbering, chords, using, roman, numerals, to, represent, the, number, of, diatonic, steps, up, from, the, tonic, note, of, the, scale, common, ways, of, notating, or, representing, chords, in, western, music, other, than, conventional, staff, notation, include, roman, numerals, the, nashville, number, system, figured, bass, chord, letters, sometimes, used, in, modern, musicology, and, chord, charts, the, english, word, chord, derives, from, middle, english, cord, a, back, formation, of, accord, in, the, original, sense, of, agreement, and, later, harmonious, sound, a, sequence, of, chords, is, known, as, a, chord, progression, or, harmonic, progression, these, are, frequently, used, in, western, music, a, chord, progression, aims, for, a, definite, goal, of, establishing, or, contradicting, a, tonality, founded, on, a, key, root, or, tonic, chord, the, study, of, harmony, involves, chords, and, chord, progressions, and, the, principles, of, connection, that, govern, them, ott, k, rolyi, writes, that, two, or, more, notes, sounded, simultaneously, are, known, as, a, chord, though, since, instances, of, any, given, note, in, different, octaves, may, be, taken, as, the, same, note, it, is, more, precise, for, the, purposes, of, analysis, to, speak, of, distinct, pitch, classes, furthermore, as, three, notes, are, needed, to, define, any, common, chord, three, is, often, taken, as, the, minimum, number, of, notes, that, form, a, definite, chord, hence, andrew, surmani, for, example, states, when, three, or, more, notes, are, sounded, together, the, combination, is, called, a, chord, george, t, jones, agrees, two, tones, sounding, together, are, usually, termed, an, interval, while, three, or, more, tones, are, called, a, chord, according, to, monath, a, chord, is, a, combination, of, three, or, more, tones, sounded, simultaneously, and, the, distances, between, the, tones, are, called, intervals, however, sonorities, of, two, pitches, or, even, single, note, melodies, are, commonly, heard, as, implying, chords, a, simple, example, of, two, notes, being, interpreted, as, a, chord, is, when, the, root, and, third, are, played, but, the, fifth, is, omitted, in, the, key, of, c, major, if, the, music, stops, on, the, two, notes, g, and, b, most, listeners, hear, this, as, a, g, major, chord, since, a, chord, may, be, understood, as, such, even, when, all, its, notes, are, not, simultaneously, audible, there, has, been, some, academic, discussion, regarding, the, point, at, which, a, group, of, notes, may, be, called, a, chord, jean, jacques, nattiez, explains, that, we, can, encounter, pure, chords, in, a, musical, work, such, as, in, the, promenade, of, modest, mussorgsky, s, pictures, at, an, exhibition, but, often, we, must, go, from, a, textual, given, to, a, more, abstract, representation, of, the, chords, being, used, as, in, claude, debussy, s, premi, re, arabesque, in, the, medieval, era, early, christian, hymns, featured, organum, which, used, the, simultaneous, perfect, intervals, of, a, fourth, a, fifth, and, an, octave, with, chord, progressions, and, harmony, an, incidental, result, of, the, emphasis, on, melodic, lines, during, the, medieval, and, then, renaissance, 15th, to, 17th, centuries, the, baroque, period, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, began, to, feature, the, major, and, minor, scale, based, tonal, system, and, harmony, including, chord, progressions, and, circle, progressions, it, was, in, the, baroque, period, that, the, accompaniment, of, melodies, with, chords, was, developed, as, in, figured, bass, and, the, familiar, cadences, perfect, authentic, etc, in, the, renaissance, certain, dissonant, sonorities, that, suggest, the, dominant, seventh, occurred, with, frequency, in, the, baroque, period, the, dominant, seventh, proper, was, introduced, and, was, in, constant, use, in, the, classical, and, romantic, periods, the, leading, tone, seventh, appeared, in, the, baroque, period, and, remains, in, use, composers, began, to, use, nondominant, seventh, chords, in, the, baroque, period, they, became, frequent, in, the, classical, period, gave, way, to, altered, dominants, in, the, romantic, period, and, underwent, a, resurgence, in, the, post, romantic, and, impressionistic, period, the, romantic, period, the, 19th, century, featured, increased, chromaticism, composers, began, to, use, secondary, dominants, in, the, baroque, and, they, became, common, in, the, romantic, period, many, contemporary, popular, western, genres, continue, to, rely, on, simple, diatonic, harmony, though, far, from, universally, notable, exceptions, include, the, music, of, film, scores, which, often, use, chromatic, atonal, or, post, tonal, harmony, and, modern, jazz, especially, c, 1960, in, which, chords, may, include, up, to, seven, notes, and, occasionally, more, when, referring, to, chords, that, do, not, function, as, harmony, such, as, in, atonal, music, the, term, sonority, is, often, used, specifically, to, avoid, any, tonal, implications, of, the, word, chord, chords, are, also, used, for, timbre, effects, in, organ, registers, certain, chords, are, activated, by, a, single, key, so, that, playing, a, melody, results, in, parallel, voice, leading, these, voices, losing, independence, are, fused, into, one, with, a, new, timbre, the, same, effect, is, also, used, in, synthesizers, and, orchestral, arrangements, for, instance, in, ravel, s, bolero, 5, the, parallel, parts, of, flutes, horn, and, celesta, being, tuned, as, a, chord, resemble, the, sound, of, an, electric, organ, chords, can, be, represented, in, various, ways, the, most, common, notation, systems, are, while, scale, degrees, are, typically, represented, in, musical, analysis, or, musicology, articles, with, arabic, numerals, e, g, 1, 2, 3, sometimes, with, a, circumflex, above, the, numeral, the, triads, three, note, chords, that, have, these, degrees, as, their, roots, are, often, identified, by, roman, numerals, e, g, i, iv, v, which, in, the, key, of, c, major, would, be, the, triads, c, major, f, major, g, major, in, some, conventions, as, in, this, and, related, articles, upper, case, roman, numerals, indicate, major, triads, e, g, i, iv, v, while, lower, case, roman, numerals, indicate, minor, triads, e, g, i, for, a, major, chord, and, i, for, a, minor, chord, or, using, the, major, key, ii, iii, and, vi, representing, typical, diatonic, minor, triads, other, writers, e, g, schoenberg, use, upper, case, roman, numerals, for, both, major, and, minor, triads, some, writers, use, upper, case, roman, numerals, to, indicate, the, chord, is, diatonic, in, the, major, scale, and, lower, case, roman, numerals, to, indicate, that, the, chord, is, diatonic, in, the, minor, scale, diminished, triads, may, be, represented, by, lower, case, roman, numerals, with, a, degree, symbol, e, g, vii, o, 7, indicates, a, diminished, seventh, chord, built, on, the, seventh, scale, degree, in, the, key, of, c, major, this, chord, would, be, b, diminished, seventh, which, consists, of, the, notes, b, d, f, and, a, roman, numerals, can, also, be, used, in, stringed, instrument, notation, to, indicate, the, position, or, string, to, play, in, some, string, music, the, string, on, which, it, is, suggested, that, the, performer, play, the, note, is, indicated, with, a, roman, numeral, e, g, on, a, four, string, orchestral, string, instrument, i, indicates, the, highest, pitched, thinnest, string, and, iv, indicates, the, lowest, pitched, thickest, bass, string, in, some, orchestral, parts, chamber, music, and, solo, works, for, string, instruments, the, composer, tells, the, performer, which, string, to, use, with, the, roman, numeral, alternately, the, composer, starts, the, note, name, with, the, string, to, use, e, g, sul, g, means, play, on, the, g, string, figured, bass, or, thoroughbass, is, a, kind, of, musical, notation, used, in, almost, all, baroque, music, c, 1600, 1750, though, rarely, in, music, from, later, than, 1750, to, indicate, harmonies, in, relation, to, a, conventionally, written, bass, line, figured, bass, is, closely, associated, with, chord, playing, basso, continuo, accompaniment, instruments, which, include, harpsichord, pipe, organ, and, lute, added, numbers, symbols, and, accidentals, beneath, the, staff, indicate, the, intervals, above, the, bass, note, to, play, that, is, the, numbers, stand, for, the, number, of, scale, steps, above, the, written, note, to, play, the, figured, notes, for, example, in, the, figured, bass, below, the, bass, note, is, a, c, and, the, numbers, 4, and, 6, indicate, that, notes, a, fourth, and, a, sixth, above, f, and, a, should, be, played, giving, the, second, inversion, of, the, f, major, triad, if, no, numbers, are, written, beneath, a, bass, note, the, figure, is, assumed, to, be, 5, 3, which, calls, for, a, third, and, a, fifth, above, the, bass, note, i, e, a, root, position, triad, in, the, 2010s, some, classical, musicians, who, specialize, in, music, from, the, baroque, era, can, still, perform, chords, using, figured, bass, notation, in, many, cases, however, the, chord, playing, performers, read, a, fully, notated, accompaniment, that, has, been, prepared, for, the, piece, by, the, music, publisher, such, a, part, with, fully, written, out, chords, is, called, a, realization, of, the, figured, bass, part, chord, letters, are, used, by, musicologists, music, theorists, and, advanced, university, music, students, to, analyze, songs, and, pieces, chord, letters, use, upper, case, and, lower, case, letters, to, indicate, the, roots, of, chords, followed, by, symbols, that, specify, the, chord, quality, in, most, genres, of, popular, music, including, jazz, pop, and, rock, a, chord, name, and, the, corresponding, symbol, are, typically, composed, of, one, or, more, parts, in, these, genres, chord, playing, musicians, in, the, rhythm, section, e, g, electric, guitar, acoustic, guitar, piano, hammond, organ, etc, typically, improvise, the, specific, voicing, of, each, chord, from, a, song, s, chord, progression, by, interpreting, the, written, chord, symbols, appearing, in, the, lead, sheet, or, fake, book, normally, these, chord, symbols, include, chord, qualities, are, related, with, the, qualities, of, the, component, intervals, that, define, the, chord, the, main, chord, qualities, are, the, symbols, used, for, notating, chords, are, the, table, below, lists, common, chord, types, their, symbols, and, their, components, the, basic, function, of, chord, symbols, is, to, eliminate, the, need, to, write, out, sheet, music, the, modern, jazz, player, has, extensive, knowledge, of, the, chordal, functions, and, can, mostly, play, music, by, reading, the, chord, symbols, only, advanced, chords, are, common, especially, in, modern, jazz, altered, 9ths, 11ths, and, 5ths, are, not, common, in, pop, music, in, jazz, a, chord, chart, is, used, by, comping, musicians, jazz, guitar, jazz, piano, hammond, organ, to, improvise, a, chordal, accompaniment, and, to, play, improvised, solos, jazz, bass, players, improvise, a, bassline, from, a, chord, chart, chord, charts, are, used, by, horn, players, and, other, solo, instruments, to, guide, their, solo, improvisations, interpretation, of, chord, symbols, depends, on, the, genre, of, music, being, played, in, jazz, from, the, bebop, era, or, later, major, and, minor, chords, are, typically, realized, as, seventh, chords, even, if, only, c, or, cm, appear, in, the, chart, in, jazz, charts, seventh, chords, are, often, realized, with, upper, extensions, such, as, the, ninth, sharp, eleventh, and, thirteenth, even, if, the, chart, only, indicates, a, 7, in, jazz, the, root, and, fifth, are, often, omitted, from, chord, voicings, except, when, there, is, a, diminished, fifth, or, an, augmented, fifth, in, a, pop, or, rock, context, however, c, and, cm, would, almost, always, be, played, as, triads, with, no, sevenths, in, pop, and, rock, in, the, relatively, less, common, cases, where, songwriters, wish, a, dominant, seventh, major, seventh, or, minor, seventh, chord, they, indicate, this, explicitly, with, the, indications, c, 7, c, maj7, or, cm, 7, within, the, diatonic, scale, every, chord, has, certain, characteristics, which, include, two, note, combinations, whether, referred, to, as, chords, or, intervals, are, called, dyads, in, the, context, of, a, specific, section, in, a, piece, of, music, dyads, can, be, heard, as, chords, if, they, contain, the, most, important, notes, of, a, certain, chord, for, example, in, a, piece, in, c, major, after, a, section, of, tonic, c, major, chords, a, dyad, containing, the, notes, b, and, d, sounds, to, most, listeners, as, a, first, inversion, g, major, chord, other, dyads, are, more, ambiguous, an, aspect, that, composers, can, use, creatively, for, example, a, dyad, with, a, perfect, fifth, has, no, third, so, it, does, not, sound, major, or, minor, a, composer, who, ends, a, section, on, a, perfect, fifth, could, subsequently, add, the, missing, third, another, example, is, a, dyad, outlining, the, tritone, such, as, the, notes, c, and, f, in, c, major, this, dyad, could, be, heard, as, implying, a, d7, chord, resolving, to, g, major, or, as, implying, a, c, diminished, chord, resolving, to, db, major, in, unaccompanied, duos, for, two, instruments, such, as, flute, duos, the, only, combinations, of, notes, that, are, possible, are, dyads, which, means, that, all, of, the, chord, progressions, must, be, implied, through, dyads, as, well, as, with, arpeggios, chords, constructed, of, three, notes, of, some, underlying, scale, are, described, as, triads, chords, of, four, notes, are, known, as, tetrads, those, containing, five, are, called, pentads, and, those, using, six, are, hexads, sometimes, the, terms, trichord, tetrachord, pentachord, and, hexachord, are, used, though, these, more, usually, refer, to, the, pitch, classes, of, any, scale, not, generally, played, simultaneously, chords, that, may, contain, more, than, three, notes, include, pedal, point, chords, dominant, seventh, chords, extended, chords, added, tone, chords, clusters, and, polychords, polychords, are, formed, by, two, or, more, chords, superimposed, often, these, may, be, analysed, as, extended, chords, examples, include, tertian, altered, chord, secundal, chord, quartal, and, quintal, harmony, and, tristan, chord, another, example, is, when, g, 7, 11, 9, g, b, d, f, a, c, is, formed, from, g, major, g, b, d, and, d, major, d, f, a, a, nonchord, tone, is, a, dissonant, or, unstable, tone, that, lies, outside, the, chord, currently, heard, though, often, resolving, to, a, chord, tone, in, the, key, of, c, major, the, first, degree, of, the, scale, called, the, tonic, is, the, note, c, itself, a, c, major, chord, the, major, triad, built, on, the, note, c, c, e, g, is, referred, to, as, the, one, chord, of, that, key, and, notated, in, roman, numerals, as, i, the, same, c, major, chord, can, be, found, in, other, scales, it, forms, chord, iii, in, the, key, of, a, minor, a, b, c, and, chord, iv, in, the, key, of, g, major, g, a, b, c, this, numbering, indicates, the, chords, s, function, many, analysts, use, lower, case, roman, numerals, to, indicate, minor, triads, and, upper, case, numerals, for, major, triads, and, degree, and, plus, signs, o, and, to, indicate, diminished, and, augmented, triads, respectively, otherwise, all, the, numerals, may, be, upper, case, and, the, qualities, of, the, chords, inferred, from, the, scale, degree, chords, outside, the, scale, can, be, indicated, by, placing, a, flat, sharp, sign, before, the, chord, for, example, the, chord, e, major, in, the, key, of, c, major, is, represented, by, iii, the, tonic, of, the, scale, may, be, indicated, to, the, left, e, g, f, or, may, be, understood, from, a, key, signature, or, other, contextual, clues, indications, of, inversions, or, added, tones, may, be, omitted, if, they, are, not, relevant, to, the, analysis, roman, numeral, analysis, indicates, the, root, of, the, chord, as, a, scale, degree, within, a, particular, major, key, as, follows, in, the, harmony, of, western, art, music, a, chord, is, in, root, position, when, the, tonic, note, is, the, lowest, in, the, chord, the, bass, note, and, the, other, notes, are, above, it, when, the, lowest, note, is, not, the, tonic, the, chord, is, inverted, chords, that, have, many, constituent, notes, can, have, many, different, inverted, positions, as, shown, below, for, the, c, major, chord, further, a, four, note, chord, can, be, inverted, to, four, different, positions, by, the, same, method, as, triadic, inversion, for, example, a, g, 7, chord, can, be, in, root, position, g, as, bass, note, first, inversion, b, as, bass, note, second, inversion, d, as, bass, note, or, third, inversion, f, as, bass, note, where, guitar, chords, are, concerned, the, term, inversion, is, used, slightly, differently, to, refer, to, stock, fingering, shapes, many, chords, are, a, sequence, of, notes, separated, by, intervals, of, roughly, the, same, size, chords, can, be, classified, into, different, categories, by, this, size, these, terms, can, become, ambiguous, when, dealing, with, non, diatonic, scales, such, as, the, pentatonic, or, chromatic, scales, the, use, of, accidentals, can, also, complicate, the, terminology, for, example, the, chord, b, e, a, appears, to, be, quartal, as, a, series, of, diminished, fourths, b, e, and, e, a, but, it, is, enharmonically, equivalent, to, and, sonically, indistinguishable, from, the, tertian, chord, c, e, g, which, is, a, series, of, major, thirds, c, e, and, e, g, the, notes, of, a, chord, form, intervals, with, each, of, the, other, notes, of, the, chord, in, combination, a, 3, note, chord, has, 3, of, these, harmonic, intervals, a, 4, note, chord, has, 6, a, 5, note, chord, has, 10, a, 6, note, chord, has, 15, the, absence, presence, and, placement, of, certain, key, intervals, plays, a, large, part, in, the, sound, of, the, chord, and, sometimes, of, the, selection, of, the, chord, that, follows, a, chord, containing, tritones, is, called, tritonic, one, without, tritones, is, atritonic, harmonic, tritones, are, an, important, part, of, dominant, seventh, chords, giving, their, sound, a, characteristic, tension, and, making, the, tritone, interval, likely, to, move, in, certain, stereotypical, ways, to, the, following, chord, tritones, are, also, present, in, diminished, seventh, and, half, diminished, chords, a, chord, containing, semitones, whether, appearing, as, minor, seconds, or, major, sevenths, is, called, hemitonic, one, without, semitones, is, anhemitonic, harmonic, semitones, are, an, important, part, of, major, seventh, chords, giving, their, sound, a, characteristic, high, tension, and, making, the, harmonic, semitone, likely, to, move, in, certain, stereotypical, ways, to, the, following, chord, a, chord, containing, major, sevenths, but, no, minor, seconds, is, much, less, harsh, in, sound, than, one, containing, minor, seconds, as, well, other, chords, of, interest, might, include, the, triads, also, called, triadic, chords, are, tertian, chords, with, three, notes, the, four, basic, triads, are, described, below, seventh, chords, are, tertian, chords, constructed, by, adding, a, fourth, note, to, a, triad, at, the, interval, of, a, third, above, the, fifth, of, the, chord, this, creates, the, interval, of, a, seventh, above, the, root, of, the, chord, the, next, natural, step, in, composing, tertian, chords, the, seventh, chord, built, on, the, fifth, step, of, the, scale, the, dominant, seventh, is, the, only, dominant, seventh, chord, available, in, the, major, scale, it, contains, all, three, notes, of, the, diminished, triad, of, the, seventh, and, is, frequently, used, as, a, stronger, substitute, for, it, there, are, various, types, of, seventh, chords, depending, on, the, quality, of, both, the, chord, and, the, seventh, added, in, chord, notation, the, chord, type, is, sometimes, superscripted, and, sometimes, not, e, g, dm7, dm, 7, and, d, m7, are, all, identical, extended, chords, are, triads, with, further, tertian, notes, added, beyond, the, seventh, the, ninth, eleventh, and, thirteenth, chords, for, example, a, minor, eleventh, chord, such, as, a, m11, consists, of, the, notes, a, c, e, g, b, d, the, upper, structure, or, extensions, i, e, notes, beyond, the, seventh, are, shown, here, in, red, this, chord, is, just, a, theoretical, illustration, of, this, chord, in, practice, a, jazz, pianist, or, jazz, guitarist, would, not, normally, play, the, chord, all, in, thirds, as, illustrated, jazz, voicings, typically, use, the, third, seventh, and, then, the, extensions, such, as, the, ninth, and, thirteenth, and, in, some, cases, the, eleventh, the, root, is, often, omitted, from, chord, voicings, as, the, bass, player, will, play, the, root, the, fifth, is, often, omitted, if, it, is, a, perfect, fifth, augmented, and, diminished, fifths, are, normally, included, in, voicings, after, the, thirteenth, any, notes, added, in, thirds, duplicate, notes, elsewhere, in, the, chord, all, seven, notes, of, the, scale, are, present, in, the, chord, so, adding, more, notes, does, not, add, new, pitch, classes, such, chords, may, be, constructed, only, by, using, notes, that, lie, outside, the, diatonic, seven, note, scale, other, extended, chords, follow, similar, rules, so, that, for, example, maj, 9, maj, 11, and, maj, 13, contain, major, seventh, chords, rather, than, dominant, seventh, chords, while, m, 9, m, 11, and, m, 13, contain, minor, seventh, chords, the, third, and, seventh, of, the, chord, are, always, determined, by, the, symbols, shown, above, the, root, cannot, be, so, altered, without, changing, the, name, of, the, chord, while, the, third, cannot, be, altered, without, altering, the, chord, s, quality, nevertheless, the, fifth, ninth, eleventh, and, thirteenth, may, all, be, chromatically, altered, by, accidentals, these, are, noted, alongside, the, altered, element, accidentals, are, most, often, used, with, dominant, seventh, chords, altered, dominant, seventh, chords, c, 7alt, may, have, a, minor, ninth, a, sharp, ninth, a, diminished, fifth, or, an, augmented, fifth, some, write, this, as, c, 7, 9, which, assumes, also, the, minor, ninth, diminished, fifth, and, augmented, fifth, the, augmented, ninth, is, often, referred, to, in, blues, and, jazz, as, a, blue, note, being, enharmonically, equivalent, to, the, minor, third, or, tenth, when, superscripted, numerals, are, used, the, different, numbers, may, be, listed, horizontally, or, vertically, an, added, tone, chord, is, a, triad, with, an, added, non, tertian, note, such, as, an, added, sixth, or, a, chord, with, an, added, second, ninth, or, fourth, eleventh, or, a, combination, of, the, three, these, chords, do, not, include, intervening, thirds, as, in, an, extended, chord, added, chords, can, also, have, variations, thus, m, add9, m, 4, and, m, 6, are, minor, triads, with, extended, notes, sixth, chords, can, belong, to, either, of, two, groups, one, is, first, inversion, chords, and, added, sixth, chords, that, contain, a, sixth, from, the, root, the, other, group, is, inverted, chords, in, which, the, interval, of, a, sixth, appears, above, a, bass, note, that, is, not, the, root, the, major, sixth, chord, also, called, sixth, or, added, sixth, with, the, chord, notation, 6, e, g, c, 6, is, by, far, the, most, common, type, of, sixth, chord, of, the, first, group, it, comprises, a, major, triad, with, the, added, major, sixth, above, the, root, common, in, popular, music, for, example, the, chord, c, 6, contains, the, notes, c, e, g, a, the, minor, sixth, chord, min, 6, or, m, 6, e, g, cm, 6, is, a, minor, triad, still, with, a, major, 6, for, example, the, chord, cm, 6, contains, the, notes, c, e, g, a, the, augmented, sixth, chord, usually, appears, in, chord, notation, as, its, enharmonic, equivalent, the, seventh, chord, this, chord, contains, two, notes, separated, by, the, interval, of, an, augmented, sixth, or, by, inversion, a, diminished, third, though, this, inversion, is, rare, the, augmented, sixth, is, generally, used, as, a, dissonant, interval, most, commonly, used, in, motion, towards, a, dominant, chord, in, root, position, with, the, root, doubled, to, create, the, octave, the, augmented, sixth, chord, resolves, to, or, to, a, tonic, chord, in, second, inversion, a, tonic, triad, with, the, fifth, doubled, for, the, same, purpose, in, this, case, the, tonic, note, of, the, key, is, included, in, the, chord, sometimes, along, with, an, optional, fourth, note, to, create, one, of, the, following, illustrated, here, in, the, key, of, c, major, the, augmented, sixth, family, of, chords, exhibits, certain, peculiarities, since, they, are, not, based, on, triads, as, are, seventh, chords, and, other, sixth, chords, they, are, not, generally, regarded, as, having, roots, nor, therefore, inversions, although, one, re, voicing, of, the, notes, is, common, with, the, namesake, interval, inverted, to, create, a, diminished, third, the, second, group, of, sixth, chords, includes, inverted, major, and, minor, chords, which, may, be, called, sixth, chords, in, that, the, six, three, 6, 3, and, six, four, 6, 4, chords, contain, intervals, of, a, sixth, with, the, bass, note, though, this, is, not, the, root, nowadays, this, is, mostly, for, academic, study, or, analysis, see, figured, bass, but, the, neapolitan, sixth, chord, is, an, important, example, a, major, triad, with, a, flat, supertonic, scale, degree, as, its, root, that, is, called, a, sixth, because, it, is, almost, always, found, in, first, inversion, though, a, technically, accurate, roman, numeral, analysis, would, be, ii, it, is, generally, labelled, n, 6, in, c, major, the, chord, is, notated, from, root, position, d, f, a, because, it, uses, chromatically, altered, tones, this, chord, is, often, grouped, with, the, borrowed, chords, but, the, chord, is, not, borrowed, from, the, relative, major, or, minor, and, it, may, appear, in, both, major, and, minor, keys, a, suspended, chord, or, sus, chord, is, a, chord, in, which, the, third, is, replaced, by, either, the, second, or, the, fourth, this, produces, two, main, chord, types, the, suspended, second, sus2, and, the, suspended, fourth, sus4, the, chords, c, sus2, and, c, sus4, for, example, consist, of, the, notes, c, d, g, and, c, f, g, respectively, there, is, also, a, third, type, of, suspended, chord, in, which, both, the, second, and, fourth, are, present, for, example, the, chord, with, the, notes, c, d, f, g, the, name, suspended, derives, from, an, early, polyphonic, technique, developed, during, the, common, practice, period, in, which, a, stepwise, melodic, progress, to, a, harmonically, stable, note, in, any, particular, part, was, often, momentarily, delayed, or, suspended, by, extending, the, duration, of, the, previous, note, the, resulting, unexpected, dissonance, could, then, be, all, the, more, satisfyingly, resolved, by, the, eventual, appearance, of, the, displaced, note, in, traditional, music, theory, the, inclusion, of, the, third, in, either, chord, would, negate, the, suspension, so, such, chords, would, be, called, added, ninth, and, added, eleventh, chords, instead, in, modern, lay, usage, the, term, is, restricted, to, the, displacement, of, the, third, only, and, the, dissonant, second, or, fourth, no, longer, must, be, held, over, prepared, from, the, previous, chord, neither, is, it, now, obligatory, for, the, displaced, note, to, make, an, appearance, at, all, though, in, the, majority, of, cases, the, conventional, stepwise, resolution, to, the, third, is, still, observed, in, post, bop, and, modal, jazz, compositions, and, improvisations, suspended, seventh, chords, are, often, used, in, nontraditional, ways, these, often, do, not, function, as, v, chords, and, do, not, resolve, from, the, fourth, to, the, third, the, lack, of, resolution, gives, the, chord, an, ambiguous, static, quality, indeed, the, third, is, often, played, on, top, of, a, sus4, chord, a, good, example, is, the, jazz, standard, maiden, voyage, extended, versions, are, also, possible, such, as, the, seventh, suspended, fourth, which, with, root, c, contains, the, notes, c, f, g, b, and, is, notated, as, c, 7sus4, c, sus4, is, sometimes, written, c, sus, since, the, sus4, is, more, common, than, the, sus2, a, borrowed, chord, is, one, from, a, different, key, than, the, home, key, the, key, of, the, piece, it, is, used, in, the, most, common, occurrence, of, this, is, where, a, chord, from, the, parallel, major, or, minor, key, is, used, particularly, good, examples, can, be, found, throughout, the, works, of, composers, such, as, schubert, for, instance, for, a, composer, working, in, the, c, major, key, a, major, iii, chord, e, g, an, e, major, chord, would, be, borrowed, as, this, chord, appears, only, in, the, key, of, c, minor, although, borrowed, chords, could, theoretically, include, chords, taken, from, any, key, other, than, the, home, key, this, is, not, how, the, term, is, used, when, a, chord, is, described, in, formal, musical, analysis, when, a, chord, is, analysed, as, borrowed, from, another, key, it, may, be, shown, by, the, roman, numeral, corresponding, with, that, key, after, a, slash, for, example, v, v, pronounced, five, of, five, indicates, the, dominant, chord, of, the, dominant, key, of, the, present, home, key, the, dominant, key, of, c, major, is, g, major, so, this, secondary, dominant, is, the, chord, of, the, fifth, degree, of, the, g, major, scale, which, is, d, major, which, can, also, be, described, as, ii, relative, to, the, key, of, c, major, not, to, be, confused, with, the, supertonic, ii, namely, d, minor, if, used, for, a, significant, duration, the, use, of, the, d, major, chord, may, cause, a, modulation, to, a, new, key, in, this, case, to, g, major, borrowed, chords, are, widely, used, in, western, popular, music, and, rock, music, for, example, there, are, a, number, of, songs, in, e, major, which, use, the, iii, chord, e, g, a, g, major, chord, used, in, an, e, major, song, the, vii, chord, e, g, a, d, major, chord, used, in, an, e, major, song, and, the, vi, chord, e, g, a, c, major, chord, used, in, an, e, major, song, all, of, these, chords, are, borrowed, from, the, key, of, e, minor, a, bell, chord, also, known, colloquially, as, bells, is, a, musical, arrangement, technique, in, which, a, composition, has, separate, instruments, or, multiples, of, the, same, instrument, play, single, notes, of, a, chord, in, sequence, sustaining, individual, notes, to, form, the, chord, it, is, in, effect, an, arpeggio, played, by, several, instruments, sequentially, this, is, also, known, as, a, pyramid, or, cascade, it, is, common, in, barbershop, music, the, technique, originated, with, jazz, big, bands, and, is, a, staple, of, trad, jazz, a, good, example, can, be, heard, in, the, introduction, to, the, charleston, by, the, temperance, seven, bohemian, rhapsody, by, the, rock, band, queen, contains, two, occurrences, of, this, bell, effect, in, the, middle, section, as, does, the, solo, in, killer, queen, starting, at,
