middlemarch, a, study, of, provincial, life, is, a, novel, by, english, author, george, eliot, the, pen, name, of, mary, ann, evans, it, appeared, in, eight, installments, volumes, in, 1871, and, 1872, set, in, middlemarch, a, fictional, english, midlands, town, in, 1829, to, 1832, it, follows, distinct, intersecting, stories, with, many, characters, issues, include, the, status, of, women, the, nature, of, marriage, idealism, self, interest, religion, hypocrisy, political, reform, and, education, despite, comic, elements, middlemarch, uses, realism, to, encompass, historical, events, the, 1832, reform, act, early, railways, and, the, accession, of, king, william, iv, it, looks, at, medicine, of, the, time, and, reactionary, views, in, a, settled, community, facing, unwelcome, change, eliot, began, writing, the, two, pieces, that, formed, the, novel, in, 1869, 1870, and, completed, it, in, 1871, initial, reviews, were, mixed, but, it, is, now, seen, widely, as, her, best, work, and, one, of, the, great, english, novels, middlemarch, originates, in, two, unfinished, pieces, that, eliot, worked, on, during, 1869, and, 1870, the, novel, middlemarch, which, focused, on, the, character, of, lydgate, and, the, long, story, miss, brooke, which, focused, on, the, character, of, dorothea, the, former, piece, is, first, mentioned, in, her, journal, on, 1, january, 1869, as, one, of, the, tasks, for, the, coming, year, in, august, she, began, writing, but, progress, ceased, in, the, following, month, amidst, a, lack, of, confidence, in, it, and, distraction, by, the, illness, of, george, henry, lewes, s, son, thornie, who, was, dying, of, tuberculosis, eliot, had, been, living, with, lewes, since, 1854, after, thornie, s, death, on, 19, october, 1869, all, work, on, the, novel, stopped, it, is, uncertain, whether, eliot, intended, at, the, time, to, revive, it, at, a, later, date, in, december, she, wrote, of, having, begun, another, story, on, a, subject, that, she, had, considered, ever, since, i, began, to, write, fiction, by, the, end, of, the, month, she, had, written, 100, pages, of, this, story, and, entitled, it, miss, brooke, although, a, precise, date, is, unknown, the, process, of, incorporating, material, from, middlemarch, into, the, story, she, had, been, working, on, was, ongoing, by, march, 1871, while, composing, eliot, compiled, a, notebook, of, hundreds, of, literary, quotations, from, poets, historians, playwrights, philosophers, and, critics, in, eight, different, languages, by, may, 1871, the, growing, length, of, the, novel, had, become, a, concern, to, eliot, as, it, threatened, to, exceed, the, three, volume, format, that, was, then, the, norm, in, publishing, the, issue, was, compounded, because, eliot, s, most, recent, novel, felix, holt, the, radical, 1866, also, set, in, the, same, pre, reform, bill, england, had, not, sold, well, the, publisher, john, blackwood, who, had, made, a, loss, on, acquiring, the, english, rights, to, that, novel, was, approached, by, lewes, in, his, role, as, eliot, s, literary, agent, he, suggested, that, the, novel, be, brought, out, in, eight, two, monthly, parts, borrowing, the, method, used, for, victor, hugo, s, novel, les, mis, rables, this, was, an, alternative, to, the, monthly, issues, that, had, been, used, for, such, longer, works, as, dickens, s, david, copperfield, and, thackeray, s, vanity, fair, and, avoided, eliot, s, objections, to, slicing, her, novel, into, small, parts, blackwood, agreed, although, he, feared, there, would, be, complaints, of, a, want, of, the, continuous, interest, in, the, story, due, to, the, independence, of, each, volume, the, eight, books, duly, appeared, during, 1872, the, last, three, instalments, being, issued, monthly, with, the, deaths, of, thackeray, and, dickens, in, 1863, and, 1870, respectively, eliot, became, recognised, as, the, greatest, living, english, novelist, at, the, time, of, the, novel, s, final, publication, middlemarch, centres, on, the, lives, of, residents, of, middlemarch, a, fictitious, midlands, town, from, 1829, onwards, the, years, up, to, the, 1832, reform, act, the, narrative, may, be, considered, to, consist, of, four, plots, with, unequal, emphasis, the, life, of, dorothea, brooke, the, career, of, tertius, lydgate, the, courtship, of, mary, garth, by, fred, vincy, and, the, disgrace, of, nicholas, bulstrode, the, two, main, plots, are, those, of, dorothea, and, lydgate, each, plot, occurs, concurrently, although, bulstrode, s, is, centred, on, the, later, chapters, dorothea, brooke, is, a, 19, year, old, orphan, living, with, her, younger, sister, celia, as, a, ward, of, her, uncle, mr, brooke, dorothea, is, an, especially, pious, young, woman, whose, hobby, involves, the, renovation, of, buildings, belonging, to, the, tenant, farmers, although, her, uncle, discourages, her, dorothea, is, courted, by, sir, james, chettam, a, man, close, to, her, own, age, but, she, is, oblivious, to, him, she, is, attracted, instead, to, the, rev, edward, casaubon, a, 45, year, old, scholar, dorothea, accepts, casaubon, s, offer, of, marriage, despite, her, sister, s, misgivings, chettam, is, encouraged, to, turn, his, attention, to, celia, who, has, developed, an, interest, in, him, fred, and, rosamond, vincy, are, the, eldest, children, of, middlemarch, s, town, mayor, having, never, finished, university, fred, is, widely, seen, as, a, failure, and, a, layabout, but, is, content, because, he, is, the, presumed, heir, of, his, childless, uncle, mr, featherstone, a, rich, but, unpleasant, man, featherstone, keeps, as, a, companion, a, niece, of, his, by, marriage, mary, garth, although, she, is, considered, plain, fred, is, in, love, with, her, and, wants, to, marry, her, dorothea, and, casaubon, experience, the, first, tensions, in, their, marriage, on, their, honeymoon, in, rome, when, dorothea, finds, that, her, husband, has, no, interest, in, involving, her, in, his, intellectual, pursuits, she, meets, will, ladislaw, casaubon, s, much, younger, disinherited, cousin, whom, he, supports, financially, ladislaw, begins, to, feel, attracted, to, dorothea, she, remains, oblivious, but, the, two, become, friendly, fred, becomes, deeply, in, debt, and, finds, himself, unable, to, repay, what, he, owes, having, asked, mr, garth, mary, s, father, to, co, sign, the, debt, he, now, tells, garth, he, must, forfeit, it, as, a, result, mrs, garth, s, savings, from, four, years, of, income, held, in, reserve, for, the, education, of, her, youngest, son, are, wiped, out, as, are, mary, s, savings, mr, garth, thus, warns, mary, against, ever, marrying, fred, fred, comes, down, with, an, illness, and, is, treated, by, dr, tertius, lydgate, a, newly, arrived, doctor, in, middlemarch, lydgate, has, modern, ideas, about, medicine, and, sanitation, which, draw, the, ire, and, criticism, of, many, in, town, he, allies, himself, with, bulstrode, a, wealthy, church, going, landowner, and, developer, who, wants, to, build, a, hospital, and, clinic, that, follow, lydgate, s, philosophy, despite, the, misgivings, of, lydgate, s, friend, farebrother, about, bulstrode, s, integrity, lydgate, also, becomes, acquainted, with, rosamond, vincy, who, is, beautiful, and, educated, but, shallow, and, self, absorbed, seeking, to, make, a, good, match, she, decides, to, marry, lydgate, who, comes, from, a, wealthy, family, and, uses, fred, s, sickness, as, an, opportunity, to, get, close, to, him, lydgate, initially, views, their, relationship, as, pure, flirtation, and, backs, away, from, rosamond, after, discovering, that, the, town, considers, them, practically, engaged, however, on, seeing, her, a, final, time, he, breaks, his, resolution, and, the, two, become, engaged, casaubon, arrives, back, from, rome, about, the, same, time, but, suffers, a, heart, attack, lydgate, attends, him, and, tells, dorothea, it, is, difficult, to, pronounce, on, the, nature, of, casaubon, s, illness, and, chances, of, recovery, that, he, may, indeed, live, about, 15, years, if, he, takes, it, easy, and, ceases, his, studies, but, it, is, equally, possible, the, disease, may, develop, rapidly, in, which, case, death, will, be, sudden, as, fred, recovers, mr, featherstone, falls, ill, on, his, deathbed, he, reveals, that, he, has, made, two, wills, and, tries, to, get, mary, to, help, him, destroy, one, unwilling, to, be, involved, in, the, business, she, refuses, and, featherstone, dies, with, both, wills, still, intact, featherstone, s, plan, had, been, for, 10, 000, to, go, to, fred, vincy, but, his, estate, and, fortune, instead, go, to, his, illegitimate, son, joshua, rigg, casaubon, in, poor, health, has, grown, suspicious, of, dorothea, s, goodwill, to, ladislaw, he, tries, to, make, dorothea, promise, if, he, should, die, to, forever, avoid, doing, what, i, should, deprecate, and, apply, yourself, to, do, what, i, should, desire, she, is, hesitant, to, agree, and, he, dies, before, she, can, reply, casaubon, s, will, is, revealed, to, contain, a, provision, that, if, dorothea, marries, ladislaw, she, will, lose, her, inheritance, this, leads, to, the, general, suspicion, that, ladislaw, and, dorothea, are, lovers, creating, awkwardness, between, the, two, ladislaw, is, in, love, with, dorothea, but, keeps, this, secret, having, no, desire, to, involve, her, in, scandal, or, cause, her, disinheritance, she, realizes, she, has, romantic, feelings, for, him, but, must, suppress, them, he, remains, in, middlemarch, working, as, a, newspaper, editor, for, mr, brooke, who, is, mounting, a, campaign, to, run, for, parliament, on, a, reform, platform, lydgate, s, efforts, to, please, rosamond, soon, leave, him, deeply, in, debt, and, he, is, forced, to, seek, help, from, bulstrode, meanwhile, fred, vincy, s, humiliation, at, being, responsible, for, caleb, garth, s, financial, setbacks, shocks, him, into, reassessing, his, life, he, resolves, to, train, as, a, land, agent, under, the, forgiving, caleb, he, asks, farebrother, to, plead, his, case, to, mary, garth, not, realizing, that, farebrother, is, also, in, love, with, her, farebrother, does, so, thereby, sacrificing, his, own, desires, for, the, sake, of, mary, who, he, realises, truly, loves, fred, and, is, just, waiting, for, him, to, find, his, place, in, the, world, john, raffles, a, mysterious, man, who, knows, of, bulstrode, s, shady, past, appears, in, middlemarch, intending, to, blackmail, him, in, his, youth, the, church, going, bulstrode, engaged, in, questionable, financial, dealings, his, fortune, is, founded, on, his, marriage, to, a, wealthy, much, older, widow, the, widow, s, daughter, who, should, have, inherited, her, mother, s, fortune, had, run, away, bulstrode, located, her, but, failed, to, disclose, this, to, the, widow, so, that, he, inherited, the, fortune, in, lieu, of, her, daughter, the, widow, s, daughter, had, a, son, who, turns, out, to, be, ladislaw, on, grasping, their, connection, bulstrode, is, consumed, with, guilt, and, offers, ladislaw, a, large, sum, of, money, which, ladislaw, refuses, as, being, tainted, bulstrode, s, terror, of, public, exposure, as, a, hypocrite, leads, him, to, hasten, the, death, of, the, mortally, sick, raffles, while, lending, a, large, sum, to, lydgate, whom, bulstrode, had, previously, refused, to, bail, out, of, his, debt, however, the, story, of, bulstrode, s, misdeeds, has, already, spread, bulstrode, s, disgrace, engulfs, lydgate, knowledge, of, the, loan, spreads, and, he, is, assumed, to, be, complicit, with, bulstrode, only, dorothea, and, farebrother, retain, any, faith, in, him, but, lydgate, and, rosamond, are, still, encouraged, to, leave, middlemarch, by, the, general, opprobrium, disgraced, and, reviled, bulstrode, s, one, consolation, is, that, his, wife, stands, by, him, as, he, too, faces, exile, when, mr, brooke, s, election, campaign, collapses, ladislaw, decides, to, leave, the, town, and, visits, dorothea, to, say, his, farewell, but, dorothea, has, fallen, in, love, with, him, she, renounces, casaubon, s, fortune, and, shocks, her, family, by, announcing, that, she, will, marry, ladislaw, at, the, same, time, fred, having, been, successful, in, his, new, career, marries, mary, the, finale, details, the, ultimate, fortunes, of, the, main, characters, fred, and, mary, marry, and, live, contentedly, with, their, three, sons, lydgate, operates, a, successful, practice, outside, middlemarch, and, attains, a, good, income, but, never, finds, fulfilment, and, dies, at, the, age, of, 50, leaving, rosamond, and, four, children, after, he, dies, rosamond, marries, a, wealthy, physician, ladislaw, engages, in, public, reform, and, dorothea, is, content, as, a, wife, and, mother, to, their, two, children, their, son, eventually, inherits, arthur, brooke, s, estate, the, action, of, middlemarch, takes, place, between, september, 1829, and, may, 1832, or, 40, years, before, its, publication, in, 1871, 1872, a, gap, not, so, pronounced, for, it, to, be, regularly, labelled, as, a, historical, novel, by, comparison, walter, scott, s, waverley, 1814, often, seen, as, the, first, major, historical, novel, takes, place, some, 60, years, before, it, appears, eliot, had, previously, written, a, more, obviously, historical, novel, romola, 1862, 1863, set, in, 15th, century, florence, the, critics, kathleen, blake, and, michael, york, mason, argue, that, there, has, been, insufficient, attention, given, to, middlemarch, as, a, historical, novel, that, evokes, the, past, in, relation, to, the, present, the, critic, rosemary, ashton, notes, that, the, lack, of, attention, to, this, side, of, the, novel, may, indicate, its, merits, middlemarch, is, that, very, rare, thing, a, successful, historical, novel, in, fact, it, is, so, successful, that, we, scarcely, think, of, it, in, terms, of, that, subgenre, of, fiction, for, its, contemporary, readers, the, present, was, the, passage, of, the, second, reform, act, in, 1867, the, agitation, for, the, reform, act, of, 1832, and, its, turbulent, passage, through, the, two, houses, of, parliament, which, provide, the, structure, of, the, novel, would, have, been, seen, as, the, past, though, rarely, categorised, as, a, historical, novel, middlemarch, s, attention, to, historical, detail, has, been, noticed, in, an, 1873, review, henry, james, recognised, that, eliot, s, purpose, was, to, be, a, generous, rural, historian, elsewhere, eliot, has, been, seen, to, adopt, the, role, of, imaginative, historian, even, scientific, investigator, in, middlemarch, and, her, narrator, as, conscious, of, the, historiographical, questions, involved, in, writing, a, social, and, political, history, of, provincial, life, this, critic, compares, the, novel, to, a, work, of, the, ancient, greek, historian, herodotus, who, is, often, described, as, the, father, of, history, the, fictional, town, of, middlemarch, north, loamshire, is, probably, based, on, coventry, where, eliot, had, lived, before, moving, to, london, like, coventry, middlemarch, is, described, as, a, silk, ribbon, manufacturing, town, the, subtitle, a, study, of, provincial, life, has, been, seen, as, significant, one, critic, views, the, unity, of, middlemarch, as, achieved, through, the, fusion, of, the, two, senses, of, provincial, on, the, one, hand, it, means, geographically, all, parts, of, the, country, except, the, capital, and, on, the, other, a, person, who, is, unsophisticated, or, narrow, minded, carolyn, steedman, links, eliot, s, emphasis, on, provincialism, in, middlemarch, to, matthew, arnold, s, discussion, of, social, class, in, england, in, culture, and, anarchy, essays, published, in, 1869, about, the, time, eliot, began, working, on, the, stories, that, became, middlemarch, there, arnold, classes, british, society, in, terms, of, barbarians, aristocrats, and, landed, gentry, philistines, urban, middle, class, and, populace, working, class, steedman, suggests, middlemarch, is, a, portrait, of, philistine, provincialism, it, is, worth, noting, that, eliot, went, to, london, as, her, heroine, dorothea, does, at, the, end, of, the, book, there, eliot, achieved, fame, way, beyond, most, women, of, her, time, whereas, dorothea, takes, on, the, role, of, nurturing, will, and, her, family, eliot, was, rejected, by, her, family, once, she, had, settled, in, her, common, law, relationship, with, lewes, and, their, profound, disapproval, prevented, her, ever, going, home, again, she, omitted, coventry, from, her, last, visit, to, the, midlands, in, 1855, central, to, middlemarch, is, the, idea, that, dorothea, brooke, cannot, hope, to, achieve, the, heroic, stature, of, a, figure, like, saint, teresa, for, eliot, s, heroine, lives, at, the, wrong, time, amidst, the, conditions, of, an, imperfect, social, state, in, which, great, feelings, will, often, take, the, aspect, of, error, and, great, faith, the, aspect, of, illusion, antigone, a, figure, from, greek, mythology, best, known, from, sophocles, play, is, given, in, the, finale, as, a, further, example, of, a, heroic, woman, the, literary, critic, kathleen, blake, notes, eliot, s, emphasis, on, st, teresa, s, very, concrete, accomplishment, the, reform, of, a, religious, order, rather, than, her, christian, mysticism, a, frequent, criticism, by, feminist, critics, is, that, not, only, is, dorothea, less, heroic, than, saint, teresa, and, antigone, but, george, eliot, herself, in, response, ruth, yeazell, and, kathleen, blake, chide, these, critics, for, expecting, literary, pictures, of, a, strong, woman, succeeding, in, a, period, that, did, not, make, them, likely, in, life, eliot, has, also, been, criticised, more, widely, for, ending, the, novel, with, dorothea, marrying, will, ladislaw, someone, so, clearly, her, inferior, the, novelist, henry, james, describes, ladislaw, as, a, dilettante, who, has, not, the, concentrated, fervour, essential, in, the, man, chosen, by, so, nobly, strenuous, a, heroine, marriage, is, one, of, the, major, themes, in, middlemarch, according, to, george, steiner, both, principal, plots, are, case, studies, of, unsuccessful, marriage, this, suggests, that, these, disastrous, marriages, leave, the, lives, of, dorothea, and, lydgate, unfulfilled, this, is, arguably, more, the, case, with, lydgate, than, with, dorothea, who, gains, a, second, chance, through, her, later, marriage, to, will, ladislaw, but, a, favourable, interpretation, of, this, marriage, depends, on, the, character, of, ladislaw, himself, whom, numerous, critics, have, viewed, as, dorothea, s, inferior, in, addition, there, is, the, meaningless, and, blissful, marriage, of, dorothea, s, sister, celia, brooke, to, sir, james, chettam, and, more, significantly, fred, vincy, s, courting, of, mary, garth, in, the, latter, mary, garth, will, not, accept, fred, until, he, abandons, the, church, and, settles, on, a, more, suitable, career, here, fred, resembles, henry, fielding, s, character, tom, jones, both, being, moulded, into, a, good, husband, by, the, love, they, give, to, and, receive, from, a, woman, dorothea, is, a, st, teresa, born, in, the, wrong, century, in, provincial, middlemarch, who, mistakes, in, her, idealistic, ardor, a, poor, dry, mummified, pedant, as, a, sort, of, angel, of, vocation, middlemarch, is, in, part, a, bildungsroman, focusing, on, the, psychological, or, moral, growth, of, the, protagonist, dorothea, blindly, gropes, forward, making, mistakes, in, her, sometimes, foolish, often, egotistical, but, also, admirably, idealistic, attempt, to, find, a, role, or, vocation, that, fulfils, her, nature, lydgate, is, equally, mistaken, in, his, choice, of, a, partner, as, his, idea, of, a, perfect, wife, is, someone, who, can, sing, and, play, the, piano, and, provide, a, soft, cushion, for, her, husband, to, rest, after, work, so, he, marries, rosamond, vincy, the, woman, in, the, novel, who, most, contrasts, with, dorothea, and, thereby, deteriorates, from, ardent, researcher, to, fashionable, doctor, in, london, the, examiner, the, spectator, and, athenaeum, reviewed, each, of, the, eight, books, that, comprise, middlemarch, as, they, were, published, from, december, 1871, to, december, 1872, such, reviews, speculated, on, the, eventual, direction, of, the, plot, and, responded, accordingly, contemporary, response, to, the, novel, was, mixed, writing, as, it, was, being, published, the, spectator, reviewer, r, h, hutton, criticised, it, for, what, he, saw, as, its, melancholic, quality, athenaeum, reviewing, it, after, serialisation, found, the, work, overwrought, and, thought, it, would, have, benefited,

that, in, a, few, instances, this, mortal, has, already, put, on, immortality, george, eliot, was, one, the, mysteries, of, human, nature, surpass, the, mysteries, of, redemption, for, the, infinite, we, only, suppose, while, we, see, the, finite, emily, dickinson, letter, to, her, cousins, louise, and, fannie, norcross, henry, james, presented, a, mixed, opinion, middlemarch, according, to, him, was, at, once, one, of, the, strongest, and, one, of, the, weakest, of, english, novels, middlemarch, is, a, treasure, house, of, details, but, it, is, an, indifferent, whole, among, the, details, his, greatest, criticism, the, only, eminent, failure, in, the, book, was, of, the, character, of, ladislaw, who, he, felt, was, an, insubstantial, hero, figure, as, against, lydgate, the, scenes, between, lydgate, and, rosamond, he, especially, praised, for, their, psychological, depth, he, doubted, whether, there, were, any, scenes, more, powerfully, real, intelligent, in, all, english, fiction, th, r, se, bentzon, for, the, revue, des, deux, mondes, was, critical, of, middlemarch, although, finding, merit, in, certain, scenes, and, qualities, she, faulted, its, structure, as, made, up, of, a, succession, of, unconnected, chapters, following, each, other, at, random, the, final, effect, is, one, of, an, incoherence, which, nothing, can, justify, in, her, view, eliot, s, prioritisation, of, observation, rather, than, imagination, inexorable, analysis, rather, than, sensibility, passion, or, fantasy, means, that, she, should, not, be, held, amongst, the, first, ranks, of, novelists, the, german, philosopher, friedrich, nietzsche, who, read, middlemarch, in, a, translation, owned, by, his, mother, and, sister, derided, the, novel, for, construing, suffering, as, a, means, of, expiating, the, debt, of, sin, which, he, found, characteristic, of, little, moralistic, females, la, eliot, despite, the, divided, contemporary, response, middlemarch, gained, immediate, admirers, in, 1873, the, poet, emily, dickinson, expressed, high, praise, for, the, novel, exclaiming, in, a, letter, to, a, friend, what, do, i, think, of, middlemarch, what, do, i, think, of, glory, the, immediate, success, of, middlemarch, may, have, been, proportioned, rather, to, the, author, s, reputation, than, to, its, intrinsic, merits, seems, to, fall, short, of, the, great, masterpieces, which, imply, a, closer, contact, with, the, world, of, realities, and, less, preoccupation, with, certain, speculative, doctrines, leslie, stephen, george, eliot, 1902, in, separate, centuries, florence, nightingale, and, kate, millett, remarked, on, the, eventual, subordination, of, dorothea, s, own, dreams, to, those, of, her, admirer, ladislaw, indeed, the, ending, acknowledges, this, and, mentions, how, unfavourable, social, conditions, prevented, her, from, fulfilling, her, potential, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, middlemarch, continued, to, provoke, contrasting, responses, while, leslie, stephen, dismissed, the, novel, in, 1902, his, daughter, virginia, woolf, described, it, in, 1919, as, the, magnificent, book, that, which, with, all, its, imperfections, is, one, of, the, few, english, novels, written, for, grown, up, people, however, woolf, was, virtually, unique, among, the, modernists, in, her, unstinting, praise, for, middlemarch, and, the, novel,
