philosophi, naturalis, principia, mathematica, english, the, mathematical, principles, of, natural, philosophy, often, referred, to, as, simply, the, principia, p, r, n, s, p, i, p, r, n, k, p, i, is, a, book, by, isaac, newton, that, expounds, newton, s, laws, of, motion, and, his, law, of, universal, gravitation, the, principia, is, written, in, latin, and, comprises, three, volumes, and, was, authorized, imprimatur, by, samuel, pepys, then, president, of, the, royal, society, on, 5, july, 1686, and, first, published, in, 1687, the, principia, is, considered, one, of, the, most, important, works, in, the, history, of, science, the, french, mathematical, physicist, alexis, clairaut, assessed, it, in, 1747, the, famous, book, of, mathematical, principles, of, natural, philosophy, marked, the, epoch, of, a, great, revolution, in, physics, the, method, followed, by, its, illustrious, author, sir, newton, spread, the, light, of, mathematics, on, a, science, which, up, to, then, had, remained, in, the, darkness, of, conjectures, and, hypotheses, the, french, scientist, joseph, louis, lagrange, described, it, as, the, greatest, production, of, a, human, mind, and, french, polymath, pierre, simon, laplace, stated, that, the, principia, is, pre, eminent, above, any, other, production, of, human, genius, newton, s, work, has, also, been, called, the, greatest, scientific, work, in, history, and, the, supreme, expression, in, human, thought, of, the, mind, s, ability, to, hold, the, universe, fixed, as, an, object, of, contemplation, a, more, recent, assessment, has, been, that, while, acceptance, of, newton, s, laws, was, not, immediate, by, the, end, of, the, century, after, publication, in, 1687, no, one, could, deny, that, a, science, had, emerged, that, at, least, in, certain, respects, so, far, exceeded, anything, that, had, ever, gone, before, that, it, stood, alone, as, the, ultimate, exemplar, of, science, generally, the, principia, forms, a, mathematical, foundation, for, the, theory, of, classical, mechanics, among, other, achievements, it, explains, johannes, kepler, s, laws, of, planetary, motion, which, kepler, had, first, obtained, empirically, in, formulating, his, physical, laws, newton, developed, and, used, mathematical, methods, now, included, in, the, field, of, calculus, expressing, them, in, the, form, of, geometric, propositions, about, vanishingly, small, shapes, in, a, revised, conclusion, to, the, principia, see, general, scholium, newton, emphasized, the, empirical, nature, of, the, work, with, the, expression, hypotheses, non, fingo, i, frame, feign, no, hypotheses, after, annotating, and, correcting, his, personal, copy, of, the, first, edition, newton, published, two, further, editions, during, 1713, with, errors, of, the, 1687, corrected, and, an, improved, version, of, 1726, the, preface, of, the, work, states, rational, mechanics, will, be, the, sciences, of, motion, resulting, from, any, forces, whatsoever, and, of, the, forces, required, to, produce, any, motion, accurately, proposed, and, demonstrated, and, therefore, we, offer, this, work, as, mathematical, principles, of, his, philosophy, for, all, the, difficulty, of, philosophy, seems, to, consist, in, this, from, the, phenomena, of, motions, to, investigate, the, forces, of, nature, and, then, from, these, forces, to, demonstrate, the, other, phenomena, the, principia, deals, primarily, with, massive, bodies, in, motion, initially, under, a, variety, of, conditions, and, hypothetical, laws, of, force, in, both, non, resisting, and, resisting, media, thus, offering, criteria, to, decide, by, observations, which, laws, of, force, are, operating, in, phenomena, that, may, be, observed, it, attempts, to, cover, hypothetical, or, possible, motions, both, of, celestial, bodies, and, of, terrestrial, projectiles, it, explores, difficult, problems, of, motions, perturbed, by, multiple, attractive, forces, its, third, and, final, book, deals, with, the, interpretation, of, observations, about, the, movements, of, planets, and, their, satellites, the, book, the, opening, sections, of, the, principia, contain, in, revised, and, extended, form, nearly, all, of, the, content, of, newton, s, 1684, tract, de, motu, corporum, in, gyrum, the, principia, begin, with, definitions, and, axioms, or, laws, of, motion, and, continues, in, three, books, book, 1, subtitled, de, motu, corporum, on, the, motion, of, bodies, concerns, motion, in, the, absence, of, any, resisting, medium, it, opens, with, a, collection, of, mathematical, lemmas, on, the, method, of, first, and, last, ratios, a, geometrical, form, of, infinitesimal, calculus, the, second, section, establishes, relationships, between, centripetal, forces, and, the, law, of, areas, now, known, as, kepler, s, second, law, propositions, 1, 3, and, relates, circular, velocity, and, radius, of, path, curvature, to, radial, force, proposition, 4, and, relationships, between, centripetal, forces, varying, as, the, inverse, square, of, the, distance, to, the, center, and, orbits, of, conic, section, form, propositions, 5, 10, propositions, 11, 31, establish, properties, of, motion, in, paths, of, eccentric, conic, section, form, including, ellipses, and, their, relationship, with, inverse, square, central, forces, directed, to, a, focus, and, include, newton, s, theorem, about, ovals, lemma, 28, propositions, 43, 45, are, demonstration, that, in, an, eccentric, orbit, under, centripetal, force, where, the, apse, may, move, a, steady, non, moving, orientation, of, the, line, of, apses, is, an, indicator, of, an, inverse, square, law, of, force, book, 1, contains, some, proofs, with, little, connection, to, real, world, dynamics, but, there, are, also, sections, with, far, reaching, application, to, the, solar, system, and, universe, propositions, 57, 69, deal, with, the, motion, of, bodies, drawn, to, one, another, by, centripetal, forces, this, section, is, of, primary, interest, for, its, application, to, the, solar, system, and, includes, proposition, 66, along, with, its, 22, corollaries, here, newton, took, the, first, steps, in, the, definition, and, study, of, the, problem, of, the, movements, of, three, massive, bodies, subject, to, their, mutually, perturbing, gravitational, attractions, a, problem, which, later, gained, name, and, fame, among, other, reasons, for, its, great, difficulty, as, the, three, body, problem, propositions, 70, 84, deal, with, the, attractive, forces, of, spherical, bodies, the, section, contains, newton, s, proof, that, a, massive, spherically, symmetrical, body, attracts, other, bodies, outside, itself, as, if, all, its, mass, were, concentrated, at, its, centre, this, fundamental, result, called, the, shell, theorem, enables, the, inverse, square, law, of, gravitation, to, be, applied, to, the, real, solar, system, to, a, very, close, degree, of, approximation, part, of, the, contents, originally, planned, for, the, first, book, was, divided, out, into, a, second, book, which, largely, concerns, motion, through, resisting, mediums, just, as, newton, examined, consequences, of, different, conceivable, laws, of, attraction, in, book, 1, here, he, examines, different, conceivable, laws, of, resistance, thus, section, 1, discusses, resistance, in, direct, proportion, to, velocity, and, section, 2, goes, on, to, examine, the, implications, of, resistance, in, proportion, to, the, square, of, velocity, book, 2, also, discusses, in, section, 5, hydrostatics, and, the, properties, of, compressible, fluids, newton, also, derives, boyle, s, law, the, effects, of, air, resistance, on, pendulums, are, studied, in, section, 6, along, with, newton, s, account, of, experiments, that, he, carried, out, to, try, to, find, out, some, characteristics, of, air, resistance, in, reality, by, observing, the, motions, of, pendulums, under, different, conditions, newton, compares, the, resistance, offered, by, a, medium, against, motions, of, globes, with, different, properties, material, weight, size, in, section, 8, he, derives, rules, to, determine, the, speed, of, waves, in, fluids, and, relates, them, to, the, density, and, condensation, proposition, 48, this, would, become, very, important, in, acoustics, he, assumes, that, these, rules, apply, equally, to, light, and, sound, and, estimates, that, the, speed, of, sound, is, around, 1088, feet, per, second, and, can, increase, depending, on, the, amount, of, water, in, air, less, of, book, 2, has, stood, the, test, of, time, than, of, books, 1, and, 3, and, it, has, been, said, that, book, 2, was, largely, written, to, refute, a, theory, of, descartes, which, had, some, wide, acceptance, before, newton, s, work, and, for, some, time, after, according, to, descartes, s, theory, of, vortices, planetary, motions, were, produced, by, the, whirling, of, fluid, vortices, that, filled, interplanetary, space, and, carried, the, planets, along, with, them, newton, concluded, book, 2, by, commenting, that, the, hypothesis, of, vortices, was, completely, at, odds, with, the, astronomical, phenomena, and, served, not, so, much, to, explain, as, to, confuse, them, book, 3, subtitled, de, mundi, systemate, on, the, system, of, the, world, is, an, exposition, of, many, consequences, of, universal, gravitation, especially, its, consequences, for, astronomy, it, builds, upon, the, propositions, of, the, previous, books, and, applies, them, with, further, specificity, than, in, book, 1, to, the, motions, observed, in, the, solar, system, here, introduced, by, proposition, 22, and, continuing, in, propositions, 25, 35, are, developed, several, of, the, features, and, irregularities, of, the, orbital, motion, of, the, moon, especially, the, variation, newton, lists, the, astronomical, observations, on, which, he, relies, and, establishes, in, a, stepwise, manner, that, the, inverse, square, law, of, mutual, gravitation, applies, to, solar, system, bodies, starting, with, the, satellites, of, jupiter, and, going, on, by, stages, to, show, that, the, law, is, of, universal, application, he, also, gives, starting, at, lemma, 4, and, proposition, 40, the, theory, of, the, motions, of, comets, for, which, much, data, came, from, john, flamsteed, and, edmond, halley, and, accounts, for, the, tides, attempting, quantitative, estimates, of, the, contributions, of, the, sun, and, moon, to, the, tidal, motions, and, offers, the, first, theory, of, the, precession, of, the, equinoxes, book, 3, also, considers, the, harmonic, oscillator, in, three, dimensions, and, motion, in, arbitrary, force, laws, in, book, 3, newton, also, made, clear, his, heliocentric, view, of, the, solar, system, modified, in, a, somewhat, modern, way, since, already, in, the, mid, 1680s, he, recognised, the, deviation, of, the, sun, from, the, centre, of, gravity, of, the, solar, system, for, newton, the, common, centre, of, gravity, of, the, earth, the, sun, and, all, the, planets, is, to, be, esteem, d, the, centre, of, the, world, and, that, this, centre, either, is, at, rest, or, moves, uniformly, forward, in, a, right, line, newton, rejected, the, second, alternative, after, adopting, the, position, that, the, centre, of, the, system, of, the, world, is, immoveable, which, is, acknowledg, d, by, all, while, some, contend, that, the, earth, others, that, the, sun, is, fix, d, in, that, centre, newton, estimated, the, mass, ratios, sun, jupiter, and, sun, saturn, and, pointed, out, that, these, put, the, centre, of, the, sun, usually, a, little, way, off, the, common, center, of, gravity, but, only, a, little, the, distance, at, most, would, scarcely, amount, to, one, diameter, of, the, sun, the, sequence, of, definitions, used, in, setting, up, dynamics, in, the, principia, is, recognisable, in, many, textbooks, today, newton, first, set, out, the, definition, of, mass, the, quantity, of, matter, is, that, which, arises, conjointly, from, its, density, and, magnitude, a, body, twice, as, dense, in, double, the, space, is, quadruple, in, quantity, this, quantity, i, designate, by, the, name, of, body, or, of, mass, this, was, then, used, to, define, the, quantity, of, motion, today, called, momentum, and, the, principle, of, inertia, in, which, mass, replaces, the, previous, cartesian, notion, of, intrinsic, force, this, then, set, the, stage, for, the, introduction, of, forces, through, the, change, in, momentum, of, a, body, curiously, for, today, s, readers, the, exposition, looks, dimensionally, incorrect, since, newton, does, not, introduce, the, dimension, of, time, in, rates, of, changes, of, quantities, he, defined, space, and, time, not, as, they, are, well, known, to, all, instead, he, defined, true, time, and, space, as, absolute, and, explained, only, i, must, observe, that, the, vulgar, conceive, those, quantities, under, no, other, notions, but, from, the, relation, they, bear, to, perceptible, objects, and, it, will, be, convenient, to, distinguish, them, into, absolute, and, relative, true, and, apparent, mathematical, and, common, instead, of, absolute, places, and, motions, we, use, relative, ones, and, that, without, any, inconvenience, in, common, affairs, but, in, philosophical, discussions, we, ought, to, step, back, from, our, senses, and, consider, things, themselves, distinct, from, what, are, only, perceptible, measures, of, them, to, some, modern, readers, it, can, appear, that, some, dynamical, quantities, recognised, today, were, used, in, the, principia, but, not, named, the, mathematical, aspects, of, the, first, two, books, were, so, clearly, consistent, that, they, were, easily, accepted, for, example, locke, asked, huygens, whether, he, could, trust, the, mathematical, proofs, and, was, assured, about, their, correctness, however, the, concept, of, an, attractive, force, acting, at, a, distance, received, a, cooler, response, in, his, notes, newton, wrote, that, the, inverse, square, law, arose, naturally, due, to, the, structure, of, matter, however, he, retracted, this, sentence, in, the, published, version, where, he, stated, that, the, motion, of, planets, is, consistent, with, an, inverse, square, law, but, refused, to, speculate, on, the, origin, of, the, law, huygens, and, leibniz, noted, that, the, law, was, incompatible, with, the, notion, of, the, aether, from, a, cartesian, point, of, view, therefore, this, was, a, faulty, theory, newton, s, defence, has, been, adopted, since, by, many, famous, physicists, he, pointed, out, that, the, mathematical, form, of, the, theory, had, to, be, correct, since, it, explained, the, data, and, he, refused, to, speculate, further, on, the, basic, nature, of, gravity, the, sheer, number, of, phenomena, that, could, be, organised, by, the, theory, was, so, impressive, that, younger, philosophers, soon, adopted, the, methods, and, language, of, the, principia, perhaps, to, reduce, the, risk, of, public, misunderstanding, newton, included, at, the, beginning, of, book, 3, in, the, second, 1713, and, third, 1726, editions, a, section, titled, rules, of, reasoning, in, philosophy, in, the, four, rules, as, they, came, finally, to, stand, in, the, 1726, edition, newton, effectively, offers, a, methodology, for, handling, unknown, phenomena, in, nature, and, reaching, towards, explanations, for, them, the, four, rules, of, the, 1726, edition, run, as, follows, omitting, some, explanatory, comments, that, follow, each, this, section, of, rules, for, philosophy, is, followed, by, a, listing, of, phenomena, in, which, are, listed, a, number, of, mainly, astronomical, observations, that, newton, used, as, the, basis, for, inferences, later, on, as, if, adopting, a, consensus, set, of, facts, from, the, astronomers, of, his, time, both, the, rules, and, the, phenomena, evolved, from, one, edition, of, the, principia, to, the, next, rule, 4, made, its, appearance, in, the, third, 1726, edition, rules, 1, 3, were, present, as, rules, in, the, second, 1713, edition, and, predecessors, of, them, were, also, present, in, the, first, edition, of, 1687, but, there, they, had, a, different, heading, they, were, not, given, as, rules, but, rather, in, the, first, 1687, edition, the, predecessors, of, the, three, later, rules, and, of, most, of, the, later, phenomena, were, all, lumped, together, under, a, single, heading, hypotheses, in, which, the, third, item, was, the, predecessor, of, a, heavy, revision, that, gave, the, later, rule, 3, from, this, textual, evolution, it, appears, that, newton, wanted, by, the, later, headings, rules, and, phenomena, to, clarify, for, his, readers, his, view, of, the, roles, to, be, played, by, these, various, statements, in, the, third, 1726, edition, of, the, principia, newton, explains, each, rule, in, an, alternative, way, and, or, gives, an, example, to, back, up, what, the, rule, is, claiming, the, first, rule, is, explained, as, a, philosophers, principle, of, economy, the, second, rule, states, that, if, one, cause, is, assigned, to, a, natural, effect, then, the, same, cause, so, far, as, possible, must, be, assigned, to, natural, effects, of, the, same, kind, for, example, respiration, in, humans, and, in, animals, fires, in, the, home, and, in, the, sun, or, the, reflection, of, light, whether, it, occurs, terrestrially, or, from, the, planets, an, extensive, explanation, is, given, of, the, third, rule, concerning, the, qualities, of, bodies, and, newton, discusses, here, the, generalisation, of, observational, results, with, a, caution, against, making, up, fancies, contrary, to, experiments, and, use, of, the, rules, to, illustrate, the, observation, of, gravity, and, space, the, general, scholium, is, a, concluding, essay, added, to, the, second, edition, 1713, and, amended, in, the, third, edition, 1726, it, is, not, to, be, confused, with, the, general, scholium, at, the, end, of, book, 2, section, 6, which, discusses, his, pendulum, experiments, and, resistance, due, to, air, water, and, other, fluids, here, newton, used, the, expression, hypotheses, non, fingo, i, formulate, no, hypotheses, in, response, to, criticisms, of, the, first, edition, of, the, principia, fingo, is, sometimes, nowadays, translated, feign, rather, than, the, traditional, frame, although, feign, does, not, properly, translate, fingo, newton, s, gravitational, attraction, an, invisible, force, able, to, act, over, vast, distances, had, led, to, criticism, that, he, had, introduced, occult, agencies, into, science, newton, firmly, rejected, such, criticisms, and, wrote, that, it, was, enough, that, the, phenomena, implied, gravitational, attraction, as, they, did, but, the, phenomena, did, not, so, far, indicate, the, cause, of, this, gravity, and, it, was, both, unnecessary, and, improper, to, frame, hypotheses, of, things, not, implied, by, the, phenomena, such, hypotheses, have, no, place, in, experimental, philosophy, in, contrast, to, the, proper, way, in, which, particular, propositions, are, inferr, d, from, the, phenomena, and, afterwards, rendered, general, by, induction, newton, also, underlined, his, criticism, of, the, vortex, theory, of, planetary, motions, of, descartes, pointing, to, its, incompatibility, with, the, highly, eccentric, orbits, of, comets, which, carry, them, through, all, parts, of, the, heavens, indifferently, newton, also, gave, theological, argument, from, the, system, of, the, world, he, inferred, the, existence, of, a, god, along, lines, similar, to, what, is, sometimes, called, the, argument, from, intelligent, or, purposive, design, it, has, been, suggested, that, newton, gave, an, oblique, argument, for, a, unitarian, conception, of, god, and, an, implicit, attack, on, the, doctrine, of, the, trinity, the, general, scholium, does, not, address, or, attempt, to, refute, the, church, doctrine, it, simply, does, not, mention, jesus, the, holy, ghost, or, the, hypothesis, of, the, trinity, in, january, 1684, edmond, halley, christopher, wren, and, robert, hooke, had, a, conversation, in, which, hooke, claimed, to, not, only, have, derived, the, inverse, square, law, but, also, all, the, laws, of, planetary, motion, wren, was, unconvinced, hooke, did, not, produce, the, claimed, derivation, although, the, others, gave, him, time, to, do, it, and, halley, who, could, derive, the, inverse, square, law, for, the, restricted, circular, case, by, substituting, kepler, s, relation, into, huygens, formula, for, the, centrifugal, force, but, failed, to, derive, the, relation, generally, resolved, to, ask, newton, halley, s, visits, to, newton, in, 1684, thus, resulted, from, halley, s, debates, about, planetary, motion, with, wren, and, hooke, and, they, seem, to, have, provided, newton, with, the, incentive, and, spur, to, develop, and, write, what, became, philosophiae, naturalis, principia, mathematica, halley, was, at, that, time, a, fellow, and, council, member, of, the, royal, society, in, london, positions, that, in, 1686, he, resigned, to, become, the, society, s, paid, clerk, halley, s, visit, to, newton, in, cambridge, in, 1684, probably, occurred, in, august, when, halley, asked, newton, s, opinion, on, the, problem, of, planetary, motions, discussed, earlier, that, year, between, halley, hooke, and, wren, newton, surprised, halley, by, saying, that, he, had, already, made, the, derivations, some, time, ago, but, that, he, could, not, find, the, papers, matching, accounts, of, this, meeting, come, from, halley, and, abraham, de, moivre, to, whom, newton, confided, halley, then, had, to, wait, for, newton, to, find, the, results, and, in, november, 1684, newton, sent, halley, an, amplified, version, of, whatever, previous, work, newton, had, done, on, the, subject, this, took, the, form, of, a, 9, page, manuscript, de, motu, corporum, in, gyrum, of, the, motion, of, bodies, in, an, orbit, the, title, is, shown, on, some, surviving, copies, although, the, lost, original, may, have, been, without, a, title, newton, s, tract, de, motu, corporum, in, gyrum, which, he, sent, to, halley, in, late, 1684, derived, what, is, now, known, as, the, three, laws, of, kepler, assuming, an, inverse, square, law, of, force, and, generalised, the, result, to, conic, sections, it, also, extended, the, methodology, by, adding, the, solution, of, a, problem, on, the, motion, of, a, body, through, a, resisting, medium, the, contents, of, de, motu, so, excited, halley, by, their, mathematical, and, physical, originality, and, far, reaching, implications, for, astronomical, theory, that, he, immediately, went, to, visit, newton, again, in, november, 1684, to, ask, newton, to, let, the, royal, society, have, more, of, such, work, the, results, of, their, meetings, clearly, helped, to, stimulate, newton, with, the, enthusiasm, needed, to, take, his, investigations, of, mathematical, problems, much, further, in, this, area, of, physical, science, and, he, did, so, in, a, period, of, highly, concentrated, work, that, lasted, at, least, until, mid, 1686, newton, s, single, minded, attention, to, his, work, generally, and, to, his, project, during, this, time, is, shown, by, later, reminiscences, from, his, secretary, and, copyist, of, the, period, humphrey, newton, his, account, tells, of, isaac, newton, s, absorption, in, his, studies, how, he, sometimes, forgot, his, food, or, his, sleep, or, the, state, of, his, clothes, and, how, when, he, took, a, walk, in, his, garden, he, would, sometimes, rush, back, to, his, room, with, some, new, thought, not, even, waiting, to, sit, before, beginning, to, write, it, down, other, evidence, also, shows, newton, s, absorption, in, the, principia, newton, for, years, kept, up, a, regular, programme, of, chemical, or, alchemical, experiments, and, he, normally, kept, dated, notes, of, them, but, for, a, period, from, may, 1684, to, april, 1686, newton, s, chemical, notebooks, have, no, entries, at, all, so, it, seems, that, newton, abandoned, pursuits, to, which, he, was, formally, dedicated, and, did, very, little, else, for, well, over, a, year, and, a, half, but, concentrated, on, developing, and, writing, what, became, his, great, work, the, first, of, the, three, constituent, books, was, sent, to, halley, for, the, printer, in, spring, 1686, and, the, other, two, books, somewhat, later, the, complete, work, published, by, halley, at, his, own, financial, risk, appeared, in, july, 1687, newton, had, also, communicated, de, motu, to, flamsteed, and, during, the, period, of, composition, he, exchanged, a, few, letters, with, flamsteed, about, observational, data, on, the, planets, eventually, acknowledging, flamsteed, s, contributions, in, the, published, version, of, the, principia, of, 1687, the, process, of, writing, that, first, edition, of, the, principia, went, through, several, stages, and, drafts, some, parts, of, the, preliminary, materials, still, survive, while, others, are, lost, except, for, fragments, and, cross, references, in, other, documents, surviving, materials, show, that, newton, up, to, some, time, in, 1685, conceived, his, book, as, a, two, volume, work, the, first, volume, was, to, be, titled, de, motu, corporum, liber, primus, with, contents, that, later, appeared, in, extended, form, as, book, 1, of, the, principia, a, fair, copy, draft, of, newton, s, planned, second, volume, de, motu, corporum, liber, secundus, survives, its, completion, dated, to, about, the, summer, of, 1685, it, covers, the, application, of, the, results, of, liber, primus, to, the, earth, the, moon, the, tides, the, solar, system, and, the, universe, in, this, respect, it, has, much, the, same, purpose, as, the, final, book, 3, of, the, principia, but, it, is, written, much, less, formally, and, is, more, easily, read, it, is, not, known, just, why, newton, changed, his, mind, so, radically, about, the, final, form, of, what, had, been, a, readable, narrative, in, de, motu, corporum, liber, secundus, of, 1685, but, he, largely, started, afresh, in, a, new, tighter, and, less, accessible, mathematical, style, eventually, to, produce, book, 3, of, the, principia, as, we, know, it, newton, frankly, admitted, that, this, change, of, style, was, deliberate, when, he, wrote, that, he, had, first, composed, this, book, in, a, popular, method, that, it, might, be, read, by, many, but, to, prevent, the, disputes, by, readers, who, could, not, lay, aside, the, prejudices, he, had, reduced, it, into, the, form, of, propositions, in, the, mathematical, way, which, should, be, read, by, those, only, who, had, first, made, themselves, masters, of, the, principles, established, in, the, preceding, books, the, final, book, 3, also, contained, in, addition, some, further, important, quantitative, results, arrived, at, by, newton, in, the, meantime, especially, about, the, theory, of, the, motions, of, comets, and, some, of, the, perturbations, of, the, motions, of, the, moon, the, result, was, numbered, book, 3, of, the, principia, rather, than, book, 2, because, in, the, meantime, drafts, of, liber, primus, had, expanded, and, newton, had, divided, it, into, two, books, the, new, and, final, book, 2, was, concerned, largely, with, the, motions, of, bodies, through, resisting, mediums, but, the, liber, secundus, of, 1685, can, still, be, read, today, even, after, it, was, superseded, by, book, 3, of, the, principia, it, survived, complete, in, more, than, one, manuscript, after, newton, s, death, in, 1727, the, relatively, accessible, character, of, its, writing, encouraged, the, publication, of, an, english, translation, in, 1728, by, persons, still, unknown, not, authorised, by, newton, s, heirs, it, appeared, under, the, english, title, a, treatise, of, the, system, of, the, world, this, had, some, amendments, relative, to, newton, s, manuscript, of, 1685, mostly, to, remove, cross, references, that, used, obsolete, numbering, to, cite, the, propositions, of, an, early, draft, of, book, 1, of, the, principia, newton, s, heirs, shortly, afterwards, published, the, latin, version, in, their, possession, also, in, 1728, under, the, new, title, de, mundi, systemate, amended, to, update, cross, references, citations, and, diagrams, to, those, of, the, later, editions, of, the, principia, making, it, look, superficially, as, if, it, had, been, written, by, newton, after, the, principia, rather, than, before, the, system, of, the, world, was, sufficiently, popular, to, stimulate, two, revisions, with, similar, changes, as, in, the, latin, printing, a, second, edition, 1731, and, a, corrected, reprint, of, the, second, edition, 1740, the, text, of, the, first, of, the, three, books, of, the, principia, was, presented, to, the, royal, society, at, the, close, of, april, 1686, hooke, made, some, priority, claims, but, failed, to, substantiate, them, causing, some, delay, when, hooke, s, claim, was, made, known, to, newton, who, hated, disputes, newton, threatened, to, withdraw, and, suppress, book, 3, altogether, but, halley, showing, considerable, diplomatic, skills, tactfully, persuaded, newton, to, withdraw, his, threat, and, let, it, go, forward, to, publication, samuel, pepys, as, president, gave, his, imprimatur, on, 30, june, 1686, licensing, the, book, for, publication, the, society, had, just, spent, its, book, budget, on, de, historia, piscium, and, the, cost, of, publication, was, borne, by, edmund, halley, who, was, also, then, acting, as, publisher, of, the, philosophical, transactions, of, the, royal, society, the, book, appeared, in, summer, 1687, after, halley, had, personally, financed, the, publication, of, principia, he, was, informed, that, the, society, could, no, longer, afford, to, provide, him, the, promised, annual, salary, of, 50, instead, halley, was, paid, with, leftover, copies, of, de, historia, piscium, nicolaus, copernicus, had, moved, the, earth, away, from, the, center, of, the, universe, with, the, heliocentric, theory, for, which, he, presented, evidence, in, his, book, de, revolutionibus, orbium, coelestium, on, the, revolutions, of, the, heavenly, spheres, published, in, 1543, johannes, kepler, wrote, the, book, astronomia, nova, a, new, astronomy, in, 1609, setting, out, the, evidence, that, planets, move, in, elliptical, orbits, with, the, sun, at, one, focus, and, that, planets, do, not, move, with, constant, speed, along, this, orbit, rather, their, speed, varies, so, that, the, line, joining, the, centres, of, the, sun, and, a, planet, sweeps, out, equal, areas, in, equal, times, to, these, two, laws, he, added, a, third, a, decade, later, in, his, 1619, book, harmonices, mundi, harmonies, of, the, world, this, law, sets, out, a, proportionality, between, the, third, power, of, the, characteristic, distance, of, a, planet, from, the, sun, and, the, square, of, the, length, of, its, year, the, foundation, of, modern, dynamics, was, set, out, in, galileo, s, book, dialogo, sopra, i, due, massimi, sistemi, del, mondo, dialogue, on, the, two, main, world, systems, where, the, notion, of, inertia, was, implicit, and, used, in, addition, galileo, s, experiments, with, inclined, planes, had, yielded, precise, mathematical, relations, between, elapsed, time, and, acceleration, velocity, or, distance, for, uniform, and, uniformly, accelerated, motion, of, bodies, descartes, book, of, 1644, principia, philosophiae, principles, of, philosophy, stated, that, bodies, can, act, on, each, other, only, through, contact, a, principle, that, induced, people, among, them, himself, to, hypothesize, a, universal, medium, as, the, carrier, of, interactions, such, as, light, and, gravity, the, aether, newton, was, criticized, for, apparently, introducing, forces, that, acted, at, distance, without, any, medium, not, until, the, development, of, particle, theory, was, descartes, notion, vindicated, when, it, was, possible, to, describe, all, interactions, like, the, strong, weak, and, electromagnetic, fundamental, interactions, using, mediating, gauge, bosons, and, gravity, through, hypothesized, gravitons, newton, had, studied, these, books, or, in, some, cases, secondary, sources, based, on, them, and, taken, notes, entitled, quaestiones, quaedam, philosophicae, questions, about, philosophy, during, his, days, as, an, undergraduate, during, this, period, 1664, 1666, he, created, the, basis, of, calculus, and, performed, the, first, experiments, in, the, optics, of, colour, at, this, time, his, proof, that, white, light, was, a, combination, of, primary, colours, found, via, prismatics, replaced, the, prevailing, theory, of, colours, and, received, an, overwhelmingly, favourable, response, and, occasioned, bitter, disputes, with, robert, hooke, and, others, which, forced, him, to, sharpen, his, ideas, to, the, point, where, he, already, composed, sections, of, his, later, book, opticks, by, the, 1670s, in, response, work, on, calculus, is, shown, in, various, papers, and, letters, including, two, to, leibniz, he, became, a, fellow, of, the, royal, society, and, the, second, lucasian, professor, of, mathematics, succeeding, isaac, barrow, at, trinity, college, cambridge, in, the, 1660s, newton, studied, the, motion, of, colliding, bodies, and, deduced, that, the, centre, of, mass, of, two, colliding, bodies, remains, in, uniform, motion, surviving, manuscripts, of, the, 1660s, also, show, newton, s, interest, in, planetary, motion, and, that, by, 1669, he, had, shown, for, a, circular, case, of, planetary, motion, that, the, force, he, called, endeavour, to, recede, now, called, centrifugal, force, had, an, inverse, square, relation, with, distance, from, the, center, after, his, 1679, 1680, correspondence, with, hooke, described, below, newton, adopted, the, language, of, inward, or, centripetal, force, according, to, newton, scholar, j, bruce, brackenridge, although, much, has, been, made, of, the, change, in, language, and, difference, of, point, of, view, as, between, centrifugal, or, centripetal, forces, the, actual, computations, and, proofs, remained, the, same, either, way, they, also, involved, the, combination, of, tangential, and, radial, displacements, which, newton, was, making, in, the, 1660s, the, difference, between, the, centrifugal, and, centripetal, points, of, view, though, a, significant, change, of, perspective, did, not, change, the, analysis, newton, also, clearly, expressed, the, concept, of, linear, inertia, in, the, 1660s, for, this, newton, was, indebted, to, descartes, work, published, 1644, hooke, published, his, ideas, about, gravitation, in, the, 1660s, and, again, in, 1674, he, argued, for, an, attracting, principle, of, gravitation, in, micrographia, of, 1665, in, a, 1666, royal, society, lecture, on, gravity, and, again, in, 1674, when, he, published, his, ideas, about, the, system, of, the, world, in, somewhat, developed, form, as, an, addition, to, an, attempt, to, prove, the, motion, of, the, earth, from, observations, hooke, clearly, postulated, mutual, attractions, between, the, sun, and, planets, in, a, way, that, increased, with, nearness, to, the, attracting, body, along, with, a, principle, of, linear, inertia, hooke, s, statements, up, to, 1674, made, no, mention, however, that, an, inverse, square, law, applies, or, might, apply, to, these, attractions, hooke, s, gravitation, was, also, not, yet, universal, though, it, approached, universality, more, closely, than, previous, hypotheses, hooke, also, did, not, provide, accompanying, evidence, or, mathematical, demonstration, on, these, two, aspects, hooke, stated, in, 1674, now, what, these, several, degrees, are, i, have, not, yet, experimentally, verified, indicating, that, he, did, not, yet, know, what, law, the, gravitation, might, follow, and, as, to, his, whole, proposal, this, i, only, hint, at, present, having, my, self, many, other, things, in, hand, which, i, would, first, compleat, and, therefore, cannot, so, well, attend, it, i, e, prosecuting, this, inquiry, in, november, 1679, hooke, began, an, exchange, of, letters, with, newton, of, which, the, full, text, is, now, published, hooke, told, newton, that, hooke, had, been, appointed, to, manage, the, royal, society, s, correspondence, and, wished, to, hear, from, members, about, their, researches, or, their, views, about, the, researches, of, others, and, as, if, to, whet, newton, s, interest, he, asked, what, newton, thought, about, various, matters, giving, a, whole, list, mentioning, compounding, the, celestial, motions, of, the, planets, of, a, direct, motion, by, the, tangent, and, an, attractive, motion, towards, the, central, body, and, my, hypothesis, of, the, lawes, or, causes, of, springinesse, and, then, a, new, hypothesis, from, paris, about, planetary, motions, which, hooke, described, at, length, and, then, efforts, to, carry, out, or, improve, national, surveys, the, difference, of, latitude, between, london, and, cambridge, and, other, items, newton, s, reply, offered, a, fansy, of, my, own, about, a, terrestrial, experiment, not, a, proposal, about, celestial, motions, which, might, detect, the, earth, s, motion, by, the, use, of, a, body, first, suspended, in, air, and, then, dropped, to, let, it, fall, the, main, point, was, to, indicate, how, newton, thought, the, falling, body, could, experimentally, reveal, the, earth, s, motion, by, its, direction, of, deviation, from, the, vertical, but, he, went, on, hypothetically, to, consider, how, its, motion, could, continue, if, the, solid, earth, had, not, been, in, the, way, on, a, spiral, path, to, the, centre, hooke, disagreed, with, newton, s, idea, of, how, the, body, would, continue, to, move, a, short, further, correspondence, developed, and, towards, the, end, of, it, hooke, writing, on, 6, january, 1680, to, newton, communicated, his, supposition, that, the, attraction, always, is, in, a, duplicate, proportion, to, the, distance, from, the, center, reciprocall, and, consequently, that, the, velocity, will, be, in, a, subduplicate, proportion, to, the, attraction, and, consequently, as, kepler, supposes, reciprocall, to, the, distance, hooke, s, inference, about, the, velocity, was, actually, incorrect, in, 1686, when, the, first, book, of, newton, s, principia, was, presented, to, the, royal, society, hooke, claimed, that, newton, had, obtained, from, him, the, notion, of, the, rule, of, the, decrease, of, gravity, being, reciprocally, as, the, squares, of, the, distances, from, the, center, at, the, same, time, according, to, edmond, halley, s, contemporary, report, hooke, agreed, that, the, demonstration, of, the, curves, generated, therby, was, wholly, newton, s, a, recent, assessment, about, the, early, history, of, the, inverse, square, law, is, that, by, the, late, 1660s, the, assumption, of, an, inverse, proportion, between, gravity, and, the, square, of, distance, was, rather, common, and, had, been, advanced, by, a, number, of, different, people, for, different, reasons, newton, himself, had, shown, in, the, 1660s, that, for, planetary, motion, under, a, circular, assumption, force, in, the, radial, direction, had, an, inverse, square, relation, with, distance, from, the, center, newton, faced, in, may, 1686, with, hooke, s, claim, on, the, inverse, square, law, denied, that, hooke, was, to, be, credited, as, author, of, the, idea, giving, reasons, including, the, citation, of, prior, work, by, others, before, hooke, newton, also, firmly, claimed, that, even, if, it, had, happened, that, he, had, first, heard, of, the, inverse, square, proportion, from, hooke, which, it, had, not, he, would, still, have, some, rights, to, it, in, view, of, his, mathematical, developments, and, demonstrations, which, enabled, observations, to, be, relied, on, as, evidence, of, its, accuracy, while, hooke, without, mathematical, demonstrations, and, evidence, in, favour, of, the, supposition, could, only, guess, according, to, newton, that, it, was, approximately, valid, at, great, distances, from, the, center, the, background, described, above, shows, there, was, basis, for, newton, to, deny, deriving, the, inverse, square, law, from, hooke, on, the, other, hand, newton, did, accept, and, acknowledge, in, all, editions, of, the, principia, that, hooke, but, not, exclusively, hooke, had, separately, appreciated, the, inverse, square, law, in, the, solar, system, newton, acknowledged, wren, hooke, and, halley, in, this, connection, in, the, scholium, to, proposition, 4, in, book, 1, newton, also, acknowledged, to, halley, that, his, correspondence, with, hooke, in, 1679, 80, had, reawakened, his, dormant, interest, in, astronomical, matters, but, that, did, not, mean, according, to, newton, that, hooke, had, told, newton, anything, new, or, original, yet, am, i, not, beholden, to, him, for, any, light, into, that, business, but, only, for, the, diversion, he, gave, me, from, my, other, studies, to, think, on, these, things, for, his, dogmaticalness, in, writing, as, if, he, had, found, the, motion, in, the, ellipsis, which, inclined, me, to, try, it, newton, s, reawakening, interest, in, astronomy, received, further, stimulus, by, the, appearance, of, a, comet, in, the, winter, of, 1680, 1681, on, which, he, corresponded, with, john, flamsteed, in, 1759, decades, after, the, deaths, of, both, newton, and, hooke, alexis, clairaut, mathematical, astronomer, eminent, in, his, own, right, in, the, field, of, gravitational, studies, made, his, assessment, after, reviewing, what, hooke, had, published, on, gravitation, one, must, not, think, that, this, idea, of, hooke, diminishes, newton, s, glory, clairaut, wrote, the, example, of, hooke, serves, to, show, what, a, distance, there, is, between, a, truth, that, is, glimpsed, and, a, truth, that, is, demonstrated, it, has, been, estimated, that, as, many, as, 750, copies, of, the, first, edition, were, printed, by, the, royal, society, and, it, is, quite, remarkable, that, so, many, copies, of, this, small, first, edition, are, still, in, existence, but, it, may, be, because, the, original, latin, text, was, more, revered, than, read, a, survey, published, in, 1953, located, 189, surviving, copies, with, nearly, 200, further, copies, located, by, the, most, recent, survey, published, in, 2020, suggesting, that, the, initial, print, run, was, larger, than, previously, thought, however, more, recent, book, historical, and, bibliographical, research, has, examined, those, prior, claims, and, concludes, that, macomber, s, earlier, estimation, of, 500, copies, is, likely, correct, in, 2016, a, first, edition, sold, for, 3, 7, million, the, second, edition, 1713, were, printed, in, 750, copies, and, the, third, edition, 1726, were, printed, in, 1, 250, copies, a, facsimile, edition, based, on, the, 3rd, edition, of, 1726, but, with, variant, readings, from, earlier, editions, and, important, annotations, was, published, in, 1972, by, alexandre, koyr, and, i, bernard, cohen, two, later, editions, were, published, by, newton, newton, had, been, urged, to, make, a, new, edition, of, the, principia, since, the, early, 1690s, partly, because, copies, of, the, first, edition, had, already, become, very, rare, and, expensive, within, a, few, years, after, 1687, newton, referred, to, his, plans, for, a, second, edition, in, correspondence, with, flamsteed, in, november, 1694, newton, also, maintained, annotated, copies, of, the, first, edition, specially, bound, up, with, interleaves, on, which, he, could, note, his, revisions, two, of, these, copies, still, survive, but, he, had, not, completed, the, revisions, by, 1708, newton, had, almost, severed, connections, with, one, would, be, editor, nicolas, fatio, de, duillier, and, another, david, gregory, seems, not, to, have, met, with, his, approval, and, was, also, terminally, ill, dying, in, 1708, nevertheless, reasons, were, accumulating, not, to, put, off, the, new, edition, any, longer, richard, bentley, master, of, trinity, college, persuaded, newton, to, allow, him, to, undertake, a, second, edition, and, in, june, 1708, bentley, wrote, to, newton, with, a, specimen, print, of, the, first, sheet, at, the, same, time, expressing, the, unfulfilled, hope, that, newton, had, made, progress, towards, finishing, the, revisions, it, seems, that, bentley, then, realised, that, the, editorship, was, technically, too, difficult, for, him, and, with, newton, s, consent, he, appointed, roger, cotes, plumian, professor, of, astronomy, at, trinity, to, undertake, the, editorship, for, him, as, a, kind, of, deputy, but, bentley, still, made, the, publishing, arrangements, and, had, the, financial, responsibility, and, profit, the, correspondence, of, 1709, 1713, shows, cotes, reporting, to, two, masters, bentley, and, newton, and, managing, and, often, correcting, a, large, and, important, set, of, revisions, to, which, newton, sometimes, could, not, give, his, full, attention, under, the, weight, of, cotes, efforts, but, impeded, by, priority, disputes, between, newton, and, leibniz, and, by, troubles, at, the, mint, cotes, was, able, to, announce, publication, to, newton, on, 30, june, 1713, bentley, sent, newton, only, six, presentation, copies, cotes, was, unpaid, newton, omitted, any, acknowledgement, to, cotes, among, those, who, gave, newton, corrections, for, the, second, edition, were, firmin, abauzit, roger, cotes, and, david, gregory, however, newton, omitted, acknowledgements, to, some, because, of, the, priority, disputes, john, flamsteed, the, astronomer, royal, suffered, this, especially, the, second, edition, was, the, basis, of, the, first, edition, to, be, printed, abroad, which, appeared, in, amsterdam, in, 1714, after, his, serious, illness, in, 1722, and, after, the, appearance, of, a, reprint, of, the, second, edition, in, amsterdam, in, 1723, the, 80, year, old, newton, began, to, revise, once, again, the, principia, in, the, fall, of, 1723, the, third, edition, was, published, 25, march, 1726, under, the, stewardship, of, henry, pemberton, m, d, a, man, of, the, greatest, skill, in, these, matters, pemberton, later, said, that, this, recognition, was, worth, more, to, him, than, the, two, hundred, guinea, award, from, newton, in, 1739, 1742, two, french, priests, p, res, thomas, leseur, and, fran, ois, jacquier, of, the, minim, order, but, sometimes, erroneously, identified, as, jesuits, produced, with, the, assistance, of, j, l, calandrini, an, extensively, annotated, version, of, the, principia, in, the, 3rd, edition, of, 1726, sometimes, this, is, referred, to, as, the, jesuit, edition, it, was, much, used, and, reprinted, more, than, once, in, scotland, during, the, 19th, century, milie, du, ch, telet, also, made, a, translation, of, newton, s, principia, into, french, unlike, leseur, and, jacquier, s, edition, hers, was, a, complete, translation, of, newton, s, three, books, and, their, prefaces, she, also, included, a, commentary, section, where, she, fused, the, three, books, into, a, much, clearer, and, easier, to, understand, summary, she, included, an, analytical, section, where, she, applied, the, new, mathematics, of, calculus, to, newton, s, most, controversial, theories, previously, geometry, was, the, standard, mathematics, used, to, analyse, theories, du, ch, telet, s, translation, is, the, only, complete, one, to, have, been, done, in, french, and, hers, remains, the, standard, french, translation, to, this, day, four, full, english, translations, of, newton, s, principia, have, appeared, all, based, on, newton, s, 3rd, edition, of, 1726, the, first, from, 1729, by, andrew, motte, was, described, by, newton, scholar, i, bernard, cohen, in, 1968, as, still, of, enormous, value, in, conveying, to, us, the, sense, of, newton, s, words, in, their, own, time, and, it, is, generally, faithful, to, the, original, clear, and, well, written, the, 1729, version, was, the, basis, for, several, republications, often, incorporating, revisions, among, them, a, widely, used, modernised, english, version, of, 1934, which, appeared, under, the, editorial, name, of, florian, cajori, though, completed, and, published, only, some, years, after, his, death, cohen, pointed, out, ways, in, which, the, 18th, century, terminology, and, punctuation, of, the, 1729, translation, might, be, confusing, to, modern, readers, but, he, also, made, severe, criticisms, of, the, 1934, modernised, english, version, and, showed, that, the, revisions, had, been, made, without, regard, to, the, original, also, demonstrating, gross, errors, that, provided, the, final, impetus, to, our, decision, to, produce, a, wholly, new, translation, the, second, full, english, translation, into, modern, english, is, the, work, that, resulted, from, this, decision, by, collaborating, translators, i, bernard, cohen, anne, whitman, and, julia, budenz, it, was, published, in, 1999, with, a, guide, by, way, of, introduction, the, third, such, translation, is, due, to, ian, bruce, and, appears, with, many, other, translations, of, mathematical, works, of, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, on, his, website, the, fourth, complete, english, translation, is, due, to, charles, leedham, green, professor, emeritus, of, mathematics, at, queen, mary, university, of, london, and, was, published, in, 2021, by, cambridge, university, press, prof, leedham, green, was, motivated, to, produce, that, translation, on, which, he, worked, for, twenty, years, in, part, because, of, his, dissatisfaction, with, the, work, of, cohen, whitman, and, budenz, whose, translation, of, the, principia, he, found, unnecessarily, obscure, leedham, green, s, aim, was, to, convey, newton, s, own, reasoning, and, arguments, in, a, way, intelligible, to, a, modern, mathematical, scientist, his, translation, is, heavily, annotated, and, his, explanatory, notes, make, use, of, the, modern, secondary, literature, on, some, of, the, more, difficult, technical, aspects, of,
