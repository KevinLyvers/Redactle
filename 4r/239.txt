clearly, stated, that, this, book, was, intended, as, an, introduction, to, tah, fut, and, he, also, stated, that, one, must, be, well, versed, in, the, ideas, of, the, philosophers, before, setting, out, to, refute, their, ideas, tah, fut, al, fal, sifa, was, the, second, work, of, this, series, the, third, work, miyar, al, ilm, fi, fan, al, mantiq, criterion, of, knowledge, in, the, art, of, logic, was, an, exposition, of, avicenna, s, logic, that, al, ghazali, stated, as, an, appendix, to, the, tah, fut, and, the, last, work, was, al, iqtis, d, f, al, i, tiqad, the, moderation, in, belief, an, exposition, of, asharite, theology, to, fill, the, metaphysical, doctrine, that, he, refuted, and, negated, in, the, tah, fut, this, series, clearly, shows, that, al, ghazali, did, not, refute, all, philosophical, science, as, many, scholars, believe, al, ghazali, stated, that, he, did, not, find, other, branches, of, philosophy, including, physics, logic, astronomy, or, mathematics, problematic, his, only, dispute, was, with, metaphysics, in, which, he, claimed, that, the, philosophers, did, not, use, the, same, tools, namely, logic, which, they, used, for, other, sciences, the, work, is, organized, into, 20, chapters, in, which, al, ghazali, attempts, to, refute, avicenna, s, doctrines, he, states, that, avicenna, and, his, followers, have, erred, in, seventeen, points, each, one, of, which, he, addresses, in, detail, in, a, chapter, for, a, total, of, 17, chapters, by, committing, heresy, but, in, three, other, chapters, he, accuses, them, of, being, utterly, irreligious, among, the, charges, that, he, leveled, against, the, philosophers, is, their, inability, to, prove, the, existence, of, god, and, inability, to, prove, the, impossibility, of, the, existence, of, two, gods, the, twenty, points, are, as, follows, among, the, twenty, points, al, ghazali, presents, three, that, he, charges, constitute, not, only, heresy, but, also, disbelief, in,

burned, directly, by, god, rather, than, by, the, fire, a, claim, which, he, defended, using, logic, in, islamic, philosophy, he, explained, that, because, god, is, usually, seen, as, rational, rather, than, arbitrary, his, behavior, in, normally, causing, events, in, the, same, sequence, i, e, what, appears, to, us, to, be, efficient, causation, can, be, understood, as, a, natural, outworking, of, that, principle, of, reason, which, we, then, describe, as, the, laws, of, nature, properly, speaking, however, these, are, not, laws, of, nature, but, laws, by, which, god, chooses, to, govern, his, own, behaviour, his, autonomy, in, the, strict, sense, in, other, words, his, rational, will, al, ghazali, expresses, his, support, for, a, scientific, methodology, based, on, demonstration, and, mathematics, while, discussing, astronomy, after, describing, the, solar, eclipse, and, the, lunar, eclipse, he, writes, whosoever, thinks, that, to, engage, in, a, disputation, for, refuting, such, a, theory, is, a, religious, duty, harms, religion, and, weakens, it, for, these, matters, rest, on, demonstrations, geometrical, and, arithmetical, that, leave, no, room, for, doubt, in, his, defense, of, the, asharite, doctrine, of, a, created, universe, that, is, temporally, finite, against, the, aristotelian, doctrine, of, an, eternal, universe, al, ghazali, proposed, the, modal, theory, of, possible, worlds, arguing, that, their, actual, world, is, the, best, of, all, possible, worlds, from, among, all, the, alternate, timelines, and, world, histories, that, god, could, have, possibly, created, his, theory, parallels, that, of, catholic, theologian, duns, scotus, in, the, 14th, century, while, it, is, uncertain, whether, al, ghazali, had, any, influence, on, scotus, they, both, may, have, derived, their, theory, from, their, readings, of, avicenna, s, metaphysics, ibn, rushd, averroes, wrote, a, refutation, of, al, ghazali, s, work, entitled, the, incoherence, of, the, incoherence, tah, fut, al, tah, fut, in, which, he, defends, the, doctrines, of, the, philosophers, and, criticizes, al, ghazali, s, own, arguments, it, is, written, as, a, sort, of, dialogue, averroes, quotes, passages, by, al, ghazali, and, then, responds, to, them, this, text, was, not, well, received, by, the, wider, islamic, audience, in, the, 15th, century, an, ottoman, turkish, scholar, mustafa, ibn, yusuf, al, bursawi, also, known, as, khwajahzada, d, 1487, wrote, a, book, about, the, incoherence, of, the, philosophers, upon, the, request, of, sultan, mehmed, the, conqueror, in, this, book, bursawi, criticises, al, ghazali, so, harshly, that, sheikh, ul, islam, ibn, kemal, expressed, a, doubt, on, if, bursawi, s, purpose, was, to, demonstrate, the, incoherence, of, al, ghazali, or, the, philosophers, another, less, critical, response, to, al, ghazali, s, arguments, was, written, by, ibn, rushd, s, predecessor, ibn, tufail, abubacer, as, part, of, his, arabic, philosophical, novel, hayy, ibn, yaqzan, later, translated, into, latin, and, english, as, philosophus, autodidactus, ibn, tufail, cites, al, ghazali, as, an, influence, on, his, novel, especially, his, views, on, sufism, but, was, critical, of, his, views, against, avicennism, ibn, al, nafis, later, wrote, another, novel, theologus, autodidactus, as, a, response, to, ibn, tufail, s, philosophus, autodidactus, defending, some, of, al, ghazali, s, views, al, ghazali, s, insistence, on, a, radical, divine, immanence, in, the, natural, world, has, been, posited, as, one, of, the, reasons, that, the, spirit, of, scientific, inquiry, later, withered, in, islamic, lands
