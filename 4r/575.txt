https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olmec_colossal_heads
the, olmec, colossal, heads, are, stone, representations, of, human, heads, sculpted, from, large, basalt, boulders, they, range, in, height, from, 1, 17, to, 3, 4, metres, 3, 8, to, 11, 2, ft, the, heads, date, from, at, least, 900, bc, and, are, a, distinctive, feature, of, the, olmec, civilization, of, ancient, mesoamerica, all, portray, mature, individuals, with, fleshy, cheeks, flat, noses, and, slightly, crossed, eyes, their, physical, characteristics, correspond, to, a, type, that, is, still, common, among, the, inhabitants, of, tabasco, and, veracruz, the, backs, of, the, monuments, often, are, flat, the, boulders, were, brought, from, the, sierra, de, los, tuxtlas, mountains, of, veracruz, given, that, the, extremely, large, slabs, of, stone, used, in, their, production, were, transported, over, large, distances, over, 150, kilometres, 93, mi, requiring, a, great, deal, of, human, effort, and, resources, it, is, thought, that, the, monuments, represent, portraits, of, powerful, individual, olmec, rulers, each, of, the, known, examples, has, a, distinctive, headdress, the, heads, were, variously, arranged, in, lines, or, groups, at, major, olmec, centres, but, the, method, and, logistics, used, to, transport, the, stone, to, these, sites, remain, unclear, they, all, display, distinctive, headgear, and, one, theory, is, that, these, were, worn, as, protective, helmets, maybe, worn, for, war, or, to, take, part, in, a, ceremonial, mesoamerican, ballgame, the, discovery, of, the, first, colossal, head, at, tres, zapotes, in, 1862, by, jos, mar, a, melgar, y, serrano, was, not, well, documented, nor, reported, outside, of, mexico, the, excavation, of, the, same, colossal, head, by, matthew, stirling, in, 1938, spurred, the, first, archaeological, investigations, of, olmec, culture, seventeen, confirmed, examples, are, known, from, four, sites, within, the, olmec, heartland, on, the, gulf, coast, of, mexico, most, colossal, heads, were, sculpted, from, spherical, boulders, but, two, from, san, lorenzo, tenochtitl, n, were, re, carved, from, massive, stone, thrones, an, additional, monument, at, takalik, abaj, in, guatemala, is, a, throne, that, may, have, been, carved, from, a, colossal, head, this, is, the, only, known, example, from, outside, the, olmec, heartland, dating, the, monuments, remains, difficult, because, of, the, movement, of, many, from, their, original, contexts, prior, to, archaeological, investigation, most, have, been, dated, to, the, early, preclassic, period, 1500, 1000, bc, with, some, to, the, middle, preclassic, 1000, 400, bc, period, the, smallest, weigh, 6, tons, while, the, largest, is, variously, estimated, to, weigh, 40, to, 50, tons, although, it, was, abandoned, and, left, uncompleted, close, to, the, source, of, its, stone, the, olmec, civilization, developed, in, the, lowlands, of, southeastern, mexico, between, 1500, and, 400, bc, the, olmec, heartland, lies, on, the, gulf, coast, of, mexico, within, the, states, of, veracruz, and, tabasco, an, area, measuring, approximately, 275, kilometres, 171, mi, east, to, west, and, extending, about, 100, kilometres, 62, mi, inland, from, the, coast, the, olmecs, are, regarded, as, the, first, civilization, to, develop, in, mesoamerica, and, the, olmec, heartland, is, one, of, six, cradles, of, civilization, worldwide, the, others, being, the, norte, chico, culture, of, south, america, the, erlitou, culture, of, china, s, yellow, river, the, indus, valley, civilization, of, the, indian, subcontinent, the, civilization, of, ancient, egypt, in, africa, and, the, sumerian, civilization, of, ancient, iraq, of, these, only, the, olmec, civilization, developed, in, a, lowland, tropical, forest, setting, the, olmecs, were, one, of, the, first, inhabitants, of, the, americas, to, construct, monumental, architecture, and, to, settle, in, towns, and, cities, predated, only, by, the, caral, civilization, they, were, also, the, first, people, in, the, americas, to, develop, a, sophisticated, style, of, stone, sculpture, in, the, first, decade, of, the, 21st, century, evidence, emerged, of, olmec, writing, with, the, earliest, examples, of, olmec, hieroglyphs, dating, to, around, 650, bc, examples, of, script, have, been, found, on, roller, stamps, and, stone, artifacts, the, texts, are, short, and, have, been, partially, deciphered, based, on, their, similarity, to, other, mesoamerican, scripts, the, evidence, of, complex, society, developing, in, the, olmec, heartland, has, led, to, the, olmecs, being, regarded, as, the, mother, culture, of, mesoamerica, although, this, concept, remains, controversial, some, of, the, olmecs, rulers, seem, to, have, served, religious, functions, the, city, of, san, lorenzo, was, succeeded, as, the, main, centre, of, the, civilization, by, la, venta, in, about, 900, bc, with, tres, zapotes, and, laguna, de, los, cerros, possibly, sharing, the, role, other, urban, centres, were, much, less, significant, the, nature, and, degree, of, the, control, exercised, by, the, centres, over, a, widespread, rural, population, remains, unclear, very, fine, olmec, art, much, clearly, made, for, an, elite, survives, in, several, forms, notably, olmec, figurines, and, larger, sculptures, such, as, the, wrestler, the, figurines, have, been, recovered, in, large, numbers, and, are, mostly, in, pottery, these, were, presumably, widely, available, to, the, population, together, with, these, of, particular, relevance, to, the, colossal, heads, are, the, olmec, style, masks, in, stone, so, called, because, none, has, yet, been, excavated, in, circumstances, that, allow, the, proper, archaeological, identification, of, an, olmec, context, these, evocative, stone, face, masks, present, both, similarities, and, differences, to, the, colossal, heads, two, thirds, of, olmec, monumental, sculpture, represents, the, human, form, and, the, colossal, heads, fall, within, this, major, theme, of, olmec, art, the, colossal, heads, cannot, be, precisely, dated, however, the, san, lorenzo, heads, were, buried, by, 900, bc, indicating, that, their, period, of, manufacture, and, use, was, earlier, still, the, heads, from, tres, zapotes, had, been, moved, from, their, original, context, before, they, were, investigated, by, archaeologists, and, the, heads, from, la, venta, were, found, partially, exposed, on, the, modern, ground, surface, the, period, of, production, of, the, colossal, heads, is, therefore, unknown, as, is, whether, it, spanned, a, century, or, a, millennium, estimates, of, the, time, span, during, which, colossal, heads, were, produced, vary, from, 50, to, 200, years, the, san, lorenzo, heads, are, believed, to, be, the, oldest, and, are, the, most, skillfully, executed, all, of, the, stone, heads, have, been, assigned, to, the, preclassic, period, of, mesoamerican, chronology, generally, to, the, early, preclassic, 1500, 1000, bc, although, the, two, tres, zapotes, heads, and, the, la, cobata, head, are, attributed, to, the, middle, preclassic, 1000, 400, bc, olmec, colossal, heads, vary, in, height, from, 1, 47, to, 3, 4, meters, or, from, 4, 10, to, 11, 2, and, weigh, between, 6, and, 50, tons, all, of, the, olmec, colossal, heads, depict, mature, men, with, flat, noses, and, fleshy, cheeks, the, eyes, tend, to, be, slightly, crossed, the, general, physical, characteristics, of, the, heads, are, of, a, type, that, is, still, common, among, people, in, the, olmec, region, in, modern, times, the, backs, of, the, heads, are, often, flat, as, if, the, monuments, were, originally, placed, against, a, wall, all, examples, of, olmec, colossal, heads, wear, distinctive, headdresses, that, probably, represent, cloth, or, animal, hide, originals, some, examples, have, a, tied, knot, at, the, back, of, the, head, and, some, are, decorated, with, feathers, a, head, from, la, venta, is, decorated, with, the, head, of, a, bird, there, are, similarities, between, the, headdresses, on, some, of, the, heads, that, has, led, to, speculation, that, specific, headdresses, may, represent, different, dynasties, or, perhaps, identify, specific, rulers, most, of, the, heads, wear, large, earspools, inserted, into, the, ear, lobes, all, of, the, heads, are, realistic, unidealised, and, frank, descriptions, of, the, men, it, is, likely, that, they, were, portraits, of, living, or, recently, deceased, rulers, well, known, to, the, sculptors, each, head, is, distinct, and, naturalistic, displaying, individualised, features, they, were, once, thought, to, represent, ballplayers, although, this, theory, is, no, longer, widely, held, it, is, possible, however, that, they, represent, rulers, equipped, for, the, mesoamerican, ballgame, facial, expressions, depicted, on, the, heads, vary, from, stern, through, placid, to, smiling, the, most, naturalistic, olmec, art, is, the, earliest, appearing, suddenly, without, surviving, antecedents, with, a, tendency, towards, more, stylised, sculpture, as, time, progressed, some, surviving, examples, of, wooden, sculpture, recovered, from, el, manat, demonstrate, that, the, olmecs, are, likely, to, have, created, many, more, perishable, sculptures, than, works, sculpted, from, stone, in, the, late, nineteenth, century, jos, melgar, y, serrano, described, a, colossal, head, as, having, ethiopian, features, and, speculations, that, the, olmec, had, african, origins, resurfaced, in, 1960, in, the, work, of, alfonso, medell, n, zenil, and, in, the, 1970s, in, the, writings, of, ivan, van, sertima, such, speculation, is, not, taken, seriously, by, mesoamerican, scholars, such, as, richard, diehl, and, ann, cyphers, genetic, studies, have, shown, that, rather, than, africa, the, earliest, americans, had, ancestry, closer, to, ancient, paleo, siberian, although, all, the, colossal, heads, are, broadly, similar, there, are, distinct, stylistic, differences, in, their, execution, one, of, the, heads, from, san, lorenzo, bears, traces, of, plaster, and, red, paint, suggesting, that, the, heads, were, originally, brightly, decorated, heads, did, not, just, represent, individual, olmec, rulers, they, also, incorporated, the, very, concept, of, rulership, itself, the, production, of, each, colossal, head, must, have, been, carefully, planned, given, the, effort, required, to, ensure, the, necessary, resources, were, available, it, seems, likely, that, only, the, more, powerful, olmec, rulers, were, able, to, mobilise, such, resources, the, workforce, would, have, included, sculptors, labourers, overseers, boatmen, woodworkers, and, other, artisans, producing, the, tools, to, make, and, move, the, monument, in, addition, to, the, support, needed, to, feed, and, otherwise, attend, to, these, workers, the, seasonal, and, agricultural, cycles, and, river, levels, needed, to, have, been, taken, into, account, to, plan, the, production, of, the, monument, and, the, whole, project, may, well, have, taken, years, from, beginning, to, end, archaeological, investigation, of, olmec, basalt, workshops, suggest, that, the, colossal, heads, were, first, roughly, shaped, using, direct, percussion, to, chip, away, both, large, and, small, flakes, of, stone, the, sculpture, was, then, refined, by, retouching, the, surface, using, hammerstones, which, were, generally, rounded, cobbles, that, could, be, of, the, same, basalt, as, the, monument, itself, although, this, was, not, always, the, case, abrasives, were, found, in, association, with, workshops, at, san, lorenzo, indicating, their, use, in, the, finishing, of, fine, detail, olmec, colossal, heads, were, fashioned, as, in, the, round, monuments, with, varying, levels, of, relief, on, the, same, work, they, tended, to, feature, higher, relief, on, the, face, and, lower, relief, on, the, earspools, and, headdresses, monument, 20, at, san, lorenzo, is, an, extensively, damaged, throne, with, a, figure, emerging, from, a, niche, its, sides, were, broken, away, and, it, was, dragged, to, another, location, before, being, abandoned, it, is, possible, that, this, damage, was, caused, by, the, initial, stages, of, re, carving, the, monument, into, a, colossal, head, but, that, the, work, was, never, completed, all, seventeen, of, the, confirmed, heads, in, the, olmec, heartland, were, sculpted, from, basalt, mined, in, the, sierra, de, los, tuxtlas, mountains, of, veracruz, most, were, formed, from, coarse, grained, dark, grey, basalt, known, as, cerro, cintepec, basalt, after, a, volcano, in, the, range, investigators, have, proposed, that, large, cerro, cintepec, basalt, boulders, found, on, the, southeastern, slopes, of, the, mountains, are, the, source, of, the, stone, for, the, monuments, these, boulders, are, found, in, an, area, affected, by, large, lahars, volcanic, mudslides, that, carried, substantial, blocks, of, stone, down, the, mountain, slopes, which, suggests, that, the, olmecs, did, not, need, to, quarry, the, raw, material, for, sculpting, the, heads, roughly, spherical, boulders, were, carefully, selected, to, mimic, the, shape, of, a, human, head, the, stone, for, the, san, lorenzo, and, la, venta, heads, was, transported, a, considerable, distance, from, the, source, the, la, cobata, head, was, found, on, el, vigia, hill, in, the, sierra, de, los, tuxtlas, and, the, stone, from, tres, zapotes, colossal, head, 1, and, nestepe, colossal, head, 1, also, known, as, tres, zapotes, monuments, a, and, q, came, from, the, same, hill, the, boulders, were, transported, over, 150, kilometres, 93, mi, from, the, source, of, the, stone, the, exact, method, of, transportation, of, such, large, masses, of, rock, are, unknown, especially, since, the, olmecs, lacked, beasts, of, burden, and, functional, wheels, and, they, were, likely, to, have, used, water, transport, whenever, possible, coastal, currents, of, the, gulf, of, mexico, and, in, river, estuaries, might, have, made, the, waterborne, transport, of, monuments, weighing, 20, tons, or, more, impractical, two, badly, damaged, olmec, sculptures, depict, rectangular, stone, blocks, bound, with, ropes, a, largely, destroyed, human, figure, rides, upon, each, block, with, their, legs, hanging, over, the, side, these, sculptures, may, well, depict, olmec, rulers, overseeing, the, transport, of, the, stone, that, would, be, fashioned, into, their, monuments, when, transport, over, land, was, necessary, the, olmecs, are, likely, to, have, used, causeways, ramps, and, roads, to, facilitate, moving, the, heads, the, regional, terrain, offers, significant, obstacles, such, as, swamps, and, floodplains, avoiding, these, would, have, necessitated, crossing, undulating, hill, country, the, construction, of, temporary, causeways, using, the, suitable, and, plentiful, floodplain, soils, would, have, allowed, a, direct, route, across, the, floodplains, to, the, san, lorenzo, plateau, earth, structures, such, as, mounds, platforms, and, causeways, upon, the, plateau, demonstrate, that, the, olmec, possessed, the, necessary, knowledge, and, could, commit, the, resources, to, build, large, scale, earthworks, the, flat, backs, of, many, of, the, colossal, heads, represented, the, flat, bases, of, the, monumental, thrones, from, which, they, were, reworked, only, four, of, the, seventeen, heartland, heads, do, not, have, flattened, backs, indicating, the, possibility, that, the, majority, were, reworked, monuments, alternatively, the, backs, of, many, of, these, massive, monuments, may, have, been, flattened, to, ease, their, transport, providing, a, stable, form, for, hauling, the, monuments, with, ropes, two, heads, from, san, lorenzo, have, traces, of, niches, that, are, characteristic, of, monumental, olmec, thrones, and, so, were, definitely, reworked, from, earlier, monuments, seventeen, confirmed, examples, are, known, an, additional, monument, at, takalik, abaj, in, guatemala, is, a, throne, that, may, have, been, carved, from, a, colossal, head, this, is, the, only, known, example, outside, of, the, olmec, heartland, on, the, gulf, coast, of, mexico, possible, fragments, of, additional, colossal, heads, have, been, recovered, at, san, lorenzo, and, at, san, fernando, in, tabasco, crude, colossal, stone, heads, are, also, known, in, the, southern, maya, area, where, they, are, associated, with, the, potbelly, style, of, sculpture, although, some, arguments, have, been, made, that, they, are, pre, olmec, these, latter, monuments, are, generally, believed, to, be, influenced, by, the, olmec, style, of, sculpture, the, ten, colossal, heads, from, san, lorenzo, originally, formed, two, roughly, parallel, lines, running, north, south, across, the, site, although, some, were, recovered, from, ravines, they, were, found, close, to, their, original, placements, and, had, been, buried, by, local, erosion, these, heads, together, with, a, number, of, monumental, stone, thrones, probably, formed, a, processional, route, across, the, site, powerfully, displaying, its, dynastic, history, two, of, the, san, lorenzo, heads, had, been, re, carved, from, older, thrones, san, lorenzo, colossal, head, 1, also, known, as, san, lorenzo, monument, 1, was, lying, facing, upwards, when, excavated, the, erosion, of, a, path, passing, on, top, of, the, monument, uncovered, its, eye, and, led, to, the, discovery, of, the, olmec, site, colossal, head, 1, is, 2, 84, metres, 9, 3, ft, high, it, measures, 2, 11, metres, 6, 9, ft, wide, and, it, weighs, 25, 3, tons, the, monument, was, discovered, partially, buried, at, the, edge, of, a, gully, by, matthew, stirling, in, 1945, when, discovered, it, was, lying, on, its, back, looking, upwards, it, was, associated, with, a, large, number, of, broken, ceramic, vessels, and, figurines, the, majority, of, these, ceramic, remains, have, been, dated, to, between, 800, and, 400, bc, some, pieces, have, been, dated, to, the, villa, alta, phase, late, classic, period, 800, 1000, ad, the, headdress, possesses, a, plain, band, that, is, tied, at, the, back, of, the, head, the, upper, portion, of, the, headdress, is, decorated, with, a, u, shaped, motif, this, element, descends, across, the, front, of, the, headdress, terminating, on, the, forehead, on, the, front, portion, it, is, decorated, with, five, semicircular, motifs, the, scalp, piece, does, not, meet, the, horizontal, band, leaving, a, space, between, the, two, pieces, on, each, side, of, the, face, a, strap, descends, from, the, headdress, and, passes, in, front, of, the, ear, the, forehead, is, wrinkled, in, a, frown, the, lips, are, slightly, parted, without, revealing, the, teeth, the, cheeks, are, pronounced, and, the, ears, are, particularly, well, executed, the, face, is, slightly, asymmetric, which, may, be, due, to, error, on, the, part, of, the, sculptors, or, may, accurately, reflect, the, physical, features, of, the, portrait, s, subject, the, head, has, been, moved, to, the, museo, de, antropolog, a, de, xalapa, anthropological, museum, of, xalapa, san, lorenzo, colossal, head, 2, also, known, as, san, lorenzo, monument, 2, was, reworked, from, a, monumental, throne, the, head, stands, 2, 69, metres, 8, 8, ft, high, and, measures, 1, 83, metres, 6, 0, ft, wide, by, 1, 05, metres, 3, 4, ft, deep, it, weighs, 20, tons, colossal, head, 2, was, discovered, in, 1945, when, matthew, stirling, s, guide, cleared, away, some, of, the, vegetation, and, mud, that, covered, it, the, monument, was, found, lying, on, its, back, facing, the, sky, and, was, excavated, in, 1946, by, stirling, and, philip, drucker, in, 1962, the, monument, was, removed, from, the, san, lorenzo, plateau, in, order, to, put, it, on, display, as, part, of, the, olmec, tradition, exhibition, at, the, museum, of, fine, arts, in, houston, in, 1963, san, lorenzo, colossal, head, 2, is, currently, in, the, museo, nacional, de, antropolog, a, in, mexico, city, the, head, was, associated, with, a, number, of, ceramic, finds, they, have, been, dated, to, the, early, preclassic, and, late, classic, periods, colossal, head, 2, wears, a, complex, headdress, that, sports, a, horizontal, band, tied, at, the, back, of, the, head, this, is, decorated, with, three, bird, s, heads, that, are, located, above, the, forehead, and, temples, the, scalp, piece, is, formed, from, six, strips, running, towards, the, back, of, the, head, the, front, of, the, headdress, above, the, horizontal, band, is, plain, two, short, straps, hang, down, from, the, headdress, in, front, of, the, ears, the, ear, jewellery, is, formed, by, large, squared, hoops, or, framed, discs, the, left, and, right, ornaments, are, different, with, radial, lines, on, the, left, earflare, a, feature, absent, on, the, right, earflare, the, head, is, badly, damaged, due, to, an, unfinished, reworking, process, this, process, has, pitmarked, the, entire, face, with, at, least, 60, smaller, hollows, and, 2, larger, holes, the, surviving, features, appear, to, depict, an, ageing, man, with, the, forehead, creased, into, a, frown, the, lips, are, thick, and, slightly, parted, to, reveal, the, teeth, the, head, has, a, pronounced, chin, san, lorenzo, colossal, head, 3, is, also, known, as, san, lorenzo, monument, 3, the, head, measures, 1, 78, metres, 5, 8, ft, high, by, 1, 63, metres, 5, 3, ft, wide, by, 0, 95, metres, 3, 1, ft, deep, and, weighs, 9, 4, tons, the, head, was, discovered, in, a, deep, gully, by, matthew, stirling, in, 1946, it, was, found, lying, face, down, and, its, excavation, was, difficult, due, to, the, wet, conditions, in, the, gully, the, monument, was, found, 0, 8, kilometres, 0, 50, mi, southwest, of, the, main, mound, at, san, lorenzo, however, its, original, location, is, unknown, erosion, of, the, gully, may, have, resulted, in, significant, movement, of, the, sculpture, head, 3, has, been, moved, to, the, museo, de, antropolog, a, de, xalapa, the, headdress, is, complex, with, the, horizontal, basal, band, being, formed, by, four, horizontal, cords, with, diagonal, folds, above, each, eye, a, small, skullcap, tops, the, headdress, a, large, flap, formed, of, four, cords, drops, down, both, sides, of, the, head, completely, covering, the, ears, the, face, has, a, typically, frowning, brow, and, unusually, has, clearly, defined, eyelids, the, lips, are, thick, and, slightly, parted, the, front, of, the, lower, lip, has, broken, away, completely, and, the, lower, front, of, the, headdress, is, pitted, with, 27, irregularly, spaced, artificial, depressions, san, lorenzo, colossal, head, 4, also, known, as, san, lorenzo, monument, 4, weighs, 6, tons, and, has, been, moved, to, the, museo, de,

in, 1946, 550, metres, 600, yd, northwest, of, the, principal, mound, at, the, edge, of, a, gully, when, excavated, it, was, found, to, be, lying, on, its, right, hand, side, and, in, a, very, good, state, of, preservation, ceramic, materials, excavated, with, the, head, became, mixed, with, ceramics, associated, with, head, 5, making, ceramic, dating, of, the, monument, difficult, the, headdress, is, decorated, with, a, horizontal, band, formed, of, four, sculpted, cords, similar, to, those, of, head, 3, on, the, right, hand, side, three, tassels, descend, from, the, upper, portion, of, the, headdress, they, terminate, in, a, total, of, eight, strips, that, hang, down, across, the, horizontal, band, these, tassels, are, judged, to, represent, hair, rather, than, cords, also, on, the, right, hand, side, two, cords, descend, across, the, ear, and, continue, to, the, base, of, the, monument, on, the, left, hand, side, three, vertical, cords, descend, across, the, ear, the, earflare, is, only, visible, on, the, right, hand, side, it, is, formed, of, a, plain, disc, and, peg, the, face, is, that, of, an, ageing, man, with, a, creased, forehead, low, cheekbones, and, a,

the, earliest, known, stone, monuments, from, the, site, the, discovery, of, one, of, the, tres, zapotes, heads, in, the, nineteenth, century, led, to, the, first, archaeological, investigations, of,

time, in, the, 1940s, when, it, was, struck, by, machinery, being, used, to, clear, vegetation, from, nestape, hill, monument, q, was, the, eleventh, colossal, head, to, be, discovered, it, was, moved, to, the, plaza, of, santiago, tuxtla, in, 1951, and, remains, there, to, this, day, monument, q, was, first, described, by, williams, and, heizer, in, an, article, published, in, 1965, the,

side, of, the, headdress, passing, over, the, ears, and, to, the, base, of, the, monument, the, face, has, pronounced, creases, around, the, nose, mouth, and, eyes, the, la, cobata, region, was, the, source, of, the, basalt, used, for, carving, all, of, the, colossal, heads, in, the, olmec, heartland, the, la, cobata, colossal, head, was, discovered, in, 1970, and, was, the, fifteenth, to, be, recorded, it, was, discovered, in, a, mountain, pass, in, the, sierra, de, los, tuxtlas, on, the, north, side, of, el, vigia, volcano, near, to, santiago, tuxtla, the, head, was, largely, buried, when, found, excavations, uncovered, a, late, classic, 600, 900, ad, offering, associated, with, the, head, consisting, of, a, ceramic, vessel, and, a, 12, centimetre, 4, 7, in, long, obsidian, knife, placed, pointing, northwards, towards, the, head, the, offering, is, believed, to, have, been, deposited, long, after, the, head, was, sculpted, the, la, cobata, head, has, been, moved, from, its, original, location, to, the, main, plaza, at, santiago, the, la, cobata, head, is, more, or, less, rounded, and, measures, 3, by, 3, metres, 9, 8, by, 9, 8, ft, by, 3, 4, metres, 11, ft, high, making, it, the, largest, known, head, this, massive, sculpture, is, estimated, to, weigh, 40, tons, it, is, stylistically, distinct, from, the, other, examples, and, beatriz, de, la, fuente, placed, it, late, in, the, olmec, time, frame, the, characteristics, of, the, sculpture, have, led, to, some, investigators, suggesting, that, it, represents, a, deceased, person, norman, hammond, argues, that, the, apparent, stylistic, differences, of, the, monument, stem, from, its, unfinished, state, rather, than, its, late, production, the, eyes, of, the, monument, are, closed, the, nose, is, flattened, and, lacks, nostrils, and, the, mouth, was, not, sculpted, in, a, realistic, manner, the, headdress, is, in, the, form, of, a, plain, horizontal, band, the, original, location, of, the, la, cobata, head, was, not, a, major, archaeological, site, and, it, is, likely, that, the, head, was, either, abandoned, at, its, source, or, during, transport, to, its, intended, destination, various, features, of, the, head, suggest, that, it, was, unfinished, such, as, a, lack, of, symmetry, below, the, mouth, and, an, area, of, rough, stone, above, the, base, rock, was, not, removed, from, around, the, earspools, as, on, other, heads, and, does, not, narrow, towards, the, base, large, parts, of, the, monument, seem, to, be, roughed, out, without, finished, detail, the, right, hand, earspool, also, appears, incomplete, the, forward, portion, is, marked, with, a, sculpted, line, while, the, rear, portion, has, been, sculpted, in, relief, probably, indicating, that, the, right, cheek, and, eye, area, were, also, unfinished, the, la, cobata, head, was, almost, certainly, carved, from, a, raw, boulder, rather, than, being, sculpted, from, a, throne, takalik, abaj, monument, 23, dates, to, the, middle, preclassic, period, and, is, found, in, takalik, abaj, an, important, city, in, the, foothills, of, the, guatemalan, pacific, coast, in, the, modern, department, of, retalhuleu, it, appears, to, be, an, olmec, style, colossal, head, re, carved, into, a, niche, figure, sculpture, if, originally, a, colossal, head, then, it, would, be, the, only, known, example, from, outside, the, olmec,

gazing, upwards, countering, this, james, porter, has, claimed, that, the, re, carving, of, the, face, of, a, colossal, head, into, a, niche, figure, is, clearly, evident, monument, 23, was, damaged, in, the, mid, twentieth, century, by, a, local, mason, who, attempted, to, break, its, exposed, upper, portion, using, a, steel, chisel, as, a, result, the, top, is, fragmented, although, the, broken, pieces, were, recovered, by, archaeologists, and, have, been, put, back, into, place, all, of, the, 17, confirmed, colossal, heads, remain, in, mexico, two, heads, from, san, lorenzo, are, on,
