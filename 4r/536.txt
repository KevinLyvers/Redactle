that, serbia, as, a, state, is, willing, to, defend, the, mural, of, convicted, war, criminal, and, have, no, intention, to, react, on, cases, of, genocide, denial, noting, that, interior, minister, of, serbia, aleksandar, vulin, decision, to, ban, any, gathering, with, an, intent, to, remove, the, mural, with, the, deployment, of, riot, police, sends, the, message, of, tacit, endorsement, consequently, on, 9, november, 2021, serbian, heavy, police, in, riot, gear, with, graffiti, creators, and, their, supporters, blocked, the, access, to, the, mural, to, prevent, human, rights, groups, and, other, activists, to, paint, over, it, and, mark, the, international, day, against, fascism, and, antisemitism, in, that, way, and, even, arrested, two, civic, activist, for, throwing, eggs, at, the, graffiti, graffiti, may, also, be, used, as, an, offensive, expression, this, form, of, graffiti, may, be, difficult, to, identify, as, it, is, mostly, removed, by, the, local, authority, as, councils, which, have, adopted, strategies, of, criminalization, also, strive, to, remove, graffiti, quickly, therefore, existing, racist, graffiti, is, mostly, more, subtle, and, at, first, sight, not, easily, recognized, as, racist, it, can, then, be, understood, only, if, one, knows, the, relevant, local, code, social, historical, political, temporal, and, spatial, which, is, seen, as, heteroglot, and, thus, a, unique, set, of, conditions, in, a, cultural, context, by, making, the, graffiti, less, explicit, as, adapted, to, social, and, legal, constraints, these, drawings, are, less, likely, to, be, removed, but, do, not, lose, their, threatening, and, offensive, character, elsewhere, activists, in, russia, have, used, painted, caricatures, of, local, officials, with, their, mouths, as, potholes, to, show, their, anger, about, the, poor, state, of, the, roads, in, manchester, england, a, graffitists, painted, obscene, images, around, potholes, which, often, resulted, in,

the, press, release, also, condemned, the, use, of, graffiti, images, in, advertising, and, in, music, videos, arguing, that, real, world, experience, of, graffiti, stood, far, removed, from, its,

certain, cases, the, highways, act, this, is, often, used, against, owners, of, property, that, are, complacent, in, allowing, protective, boards, to, be, defaced, so, long, as, the, property, is, not, damaged, in, july, 2008, a, conspiracy, charge, was, used, to, convict, graffitists, for, the, first, time, after, a, three, month, police, surveillance, operation, nine, members, of, the, dpm, crew, were, convicted, of, conspiracy, to, commit, criminal, damage, costing, at, least, 1, million, five, of, them, received, prison, sentences, ranging, from, eighteen, months, to, two, years, the, unprecedented, scale, of, the, investigation, and, the, severity, of, the, sentences, rekindled, public, debate, over, whether, graffiti, should, be, considered, art, or, crime, some, councils, like, those, of, stroud, and, loerrach, provide, approved, areas, in, the, town, where, graffitists, can, showcase, their, talents, including, underpasses, car, parks, and, walls, that, might, otherwise, prove, a, target, for, the, spray, and, run, ancient, rock, art, in, australia, is, seen, as, a, sacred, part, of, first, nations, histories, and, many, of, it, is, legally, protected, and, some, are, given, national, heritage, status, in, an, effort, to, reduce, vandalism, many, cities, in, australia, have, designated, walls, or, areas, exclusively, for, use, by, writers, one, early, example, is, the, graffiti, tunnel, located, at, the, camperdown, campus, of, the, university, of, sydney, which, is, available, for, use, by, any, student, at, the, university, to, tag, advertise, poster, and, paint, advocates, of, this, idea, suggest, that, this, discourages, petty, vandalism, yet, encourages, artists, to, take, their, time, and, produce, great, art, without, worry, of, being, caught, or, arrested, for, vandalism, or, trespassing, others, disagree, with, this, approach, arguing, that, the, presence, of, legal, graffiti, walls, does, not, demonstrably, reduce, illegal, graffiti, elsewhere, some, local, government, areas, throughout, australia, have, introduced, anti, graffiti, squads, who, clean, graffiti, in, the, area, and, such, crews, as, bcw, buffers, can, t, win, have, taken, steps, to, keep, one, step, ahead, of, local, graffiti, cleaners, many, state, governments, have, banned, the, sale, or, possession, of, spray, paint, to, those, under, the, age, of, 18, age, of, majority, however, a, number, of, local, governments, in, victoria, have, taken, steps, to, recognize, the, cultural, heritage, value, of, some, examples, of, graffiti, such, as, prominent, political, graffiti, tough, new, graffiti, laws, have, been, introduced, in, australia, with, fines, of, up, to, a, 26, 000, and, two, years, in, prison, melbourne, is, a, prominent, graffiti, city, of, australia, with, many, of, its, lanes, being, tourist, attractions, such, as, hosier, lane, in, particular, a, popular, destination, for, photographers, wedding, photography, and, backdrops, for, corporate, print, advertising, the, lonely, planet, travel, guide, cites, melbourne, s, street, as, a, major, attraction, all, forms, of, graffiti, including, sticker, art, poster, stencil, art, and, wheatpasting, can, be, found, in, many, places, throughout, the, city, prominent, street, art, precincts, include, fitzroy, collingwood, northcote, brunswick, st, kilda, and, the, cbd, where, stencil, and, sticker, art, is, prominent, as, one, moves, farther, away, from, the, city, mostly, along, suburban, train, lines, graffiti, tags, become, more, prominent, many, international, artists, such, as, banksy, have, left, their, work, in, melbourne, and, in, early, 2008, a, perspex, screen, was, installed, to, prevent, a, banksy, stencil, art, piece, from, being, destroyed, it, has, survived, since, 2003, through, the, respect, of, local, street, artists, avoiding, posting, over, it, although, it, has, recently, had, paint, tipped, over, it, in, february, 2008, helen, clark, the, new, zealand, prime, minister, at, that, time, announced, a, government, crackdown, on, tagging, and, other, forms, of, graffiti, vandalism, describing, it, as, a, destructive, crime, representing, an, invasion, of, public, and, private, property, new, legislation, subsequently, adopted, included, a, ban, on, the, sale, of, paint, spray, cans, to, persons, under, 18, and, increases, in, maximum, fines, for, the, offence, from, nz, 200, to, nz, 2, 000, or, extended, community, service, the, issue, of, tagging, become, a, widely, debated, one, following, an, incident, in, auckland, during, january, 2008, in, which, a, middle, aged, property, owner, stabbed, one, of, two, teenage, taggers, to, death, and, was, subsequently, convicted, of, manslaughter, graffiti, databases, have, increased, in, the, past, decade, because, they, allow, vandalism, incidents, to, be, fully, documented, against, an, offender, and, help, the, police, and, prosecution, charge, and, prosecute, offenders, for, multiple, counts, of, vandalism, they, also, provide, law, enforcement, the, ability, to, rapidly, search, for, an, offender, s, moniker, or, tag, in, a, simple, effective, and, comprehensive, way, these, systems, can, also, help, track, costs, of, damage, to, a, city, to, help, allocate, an, anti, graffiti, budget, the, theory, is, that, when, an, offender, is, caught, putting, up, graffiti, they, are, not, just, charged, with, one, count, of, vandalism, they, can, be, held, accountable, for, all, the, other, damage, for, which, they, are, responsible, this, has, two, main, benefits, for, law, enforcement, one, it, sends, a, signal, to, the, offenders, that, their, vandalism, is, being, tracked, two, a, city, can, seek, restitution, from, offenders, for, all, the, damage, that, they, have, committed, not, merely, a, single, incident, these, systems, give, law, enforcement, personnel, real, time, street, level, intelligence, that, allows, them, not, only, to, focus, on, the, worst, graffiti, offenders, and, their, damage, but, also, to, monitor, potential, gang, violence, that, is, associated, with, the, graffiti, many, restrictions, of, civil, gang, injunctions, are, designed, to, help, address, and, protect, the, physical, environment, and, limit, graffiti, provisions, of, gang, injunctions, include, things, such, as, restricting, the, possession, of, marker, pens, spray, paint, cans, or, other, sharp, objects, capable, of, defacing, private, or, public, property, spray, painting, or, marking, with, marker, pens, scratching, applying, stickers, or, otherwise, applying, graffiti, on, any, public, or, private, property, including, but, not, limited, to, the, street, alley, residences, block, walls, and, fences, vehicles, or, any, other, real, or, personal, property, some, injunctions, contain, wording, that, restricts, damaging, or, vandalizing, both, public, and, private, property, including, but, not, limited, to, any, vehicle, light, fixture, door, fence, wall, gate, window, building, street, sign, utility, box, telephone, box, tree, or, power, pole, to, help, address, many, of, these, issues, many, local, jurisdictions, have, set, up, graffiti, abatement, hotlines, where, citizens, can, call, in, and, report, vandalism, and, have, it, removed, san, diego, s, hotline, receives, more, than, 5, 000, calls, per, year, in, addition, to, reporting, the, graffiti, callers, can, learn, more, about, prevention, one, of, the, complaints, about, these, hotlines, is, the, response, time, there, is, often, a, lag, time, between, a, property, owner, calling, about, the, graffiti, and, its, removal, the, length, of, delay, should, be, a, consideration, for, any, jurisdiction, planning, on, operating, a, hotline, local, jurisdictions, must, convince, the, callers, that, their, complaint, of, vandalism, will, be, a, priority, and, cleaned, off, right, away, if, the, jurisdiction, does, not, have, the, resources, to, respond, to, complaints, in, a, timely, manner, the, value, of, the, hotline, diminishes, crews, must, be, able, to, respond, to, individual, service, calls, made, to, the, graffiti, hotline, as, well, as, focus, on, cleanup, near, schools, parks, and, major, intersections, and, transit, routes, to, have, the, biggest, impact, some, cities, offer, a, reward, for, information, leading, to, the, arrest, and, prosecution, of, suspects, for, tagging, or, graffiti, related, vandalism, the, amount, of, the, reward, is, based, on, the, information, provided, and, the, action, taken, when, police, obtain, search, warrants, in, connection, with, a, vandalism, investigation, they, are, often, seeking, judicial, approval, to, look, for, items, such, as, cans, of, spray, paint, and, nozzles, from, other, kinds, of, aerosol, sprays, etching, tools, or, other, sharp, or, pointed, objects, which, could, be, used, to, etch, or, scratch, glass, and, other, hard, surfaces, permanent, marking, pens, markers, or, paint, sticks, evidence, of, membership, or, affiliation, with, any, gang, or, tagging, crew, paraphernalia, including, any, reference, to, tagger, s, name, any, drawings, writing, objects, or, graffiti, depicting, taggers, names, initials, logos, monikers, slogans, or, any, mention, of, tagging, crew, membership, and, any, newspaper, clippings, relating, to, graffiti, crime
