sonata, s, n, t, italian, pl, sonate, from, latin, and, italian, sonare, to, sound, in, music, literally, means, a, piece, played, as, opposed, to, a, cantata, latin, and, italian, cantare, to, sing, a, piece, sung, 17, the, term, evolved, through, the, history, of, music, designating, a, variety, of, forms, until, the, classical, era, when, it, took, on, increasing, importance, sonata, is, a, vague, term, with, varying, meanings, depending, on, the, context, and, time, period, by, the, early, 19th, century, it, came, to, represent, a, principle, of, composing, large, scale, works, it, was, applied, to, most, instrumental, genres, and, regarded, alongside, the, fugue, as, one, of, two, fundamental, methods, of, organizing, interpreting, and, analyzing, concert, music, though, the, musical, style, of, sonatas, has, changed, since, the, classical, era, most, 20th, and, 21st, century, sonatas, still, maintain, the, same, structure, the, term, sonatina, pl, sonatine, the, diminutive, form, of, sonata, is, often, used, for, a, short, or, technically, easy, sonata, in, the, baroque, period, a, sonata, was, for, one, or, more, instruments, almost, always, with, continuo, after, the, baroque, period, most, works, designated, as, sonatas, specifically, are, performed, by, a, solo, instrument, most, often, a, keyboard, instrument, or, by, a, solo, instrument, accompanied, by, a, keyboard, instrument, sonatas, for, a, solo, instrument, other, than, keyboard, have, been, composed, as, have, sonatas, for, other, combinations, of, instruments, in, the, works, of, arcangelo, corelli, and, his, contemporaries, two, broad, classes, of, sonata, were, established, and, were, first, described, by, s, bastien, de, brossard, in, his, dictionaire, de, musique, third, edition, amsterdam, ca, 1710, the, sonata, da, chiesa, that, is, suitable, for, use, in, church, which, was, the, type, rightly, known, as, sonatas, and, the, sonata, da, camera, proper, for, use, at, court, which, consists, of, a, prelude, followed, by, a, succession, of, dances, all, in, the, same, key, 21, 40, although, the, four, five, or, six, movements, of, the, sonata, da, chiesa, are, also, most, often, in, one, key, one, or, two, of, the, internal, movements, are, sometimes, in, a, contrasting, tonality, the, sonata, da, chiesa, generally, for, one, or, two, violins, and, basso, continuo, consisted, normally, of, a, slow, introduction, a, loosely, fugued, allegro, a, cantabile, slow, movement, and, a, lively, finale, in, some, binary, form, suggesting, affinity, with, the, dance, tunes, of, the, suite, this, scheme, however, was, not, very, clearly, defined, until, the, works, of, arcangelo, corelli, when, it, became, the, essential, sonata, and, persisted, as, a, tradition, of, italian, violin, music, the, sonata, da, camera, consisted, almost, entirely, of, idealized, dance, tunes, on, the, other, hand, the, features, of, sonata, da, chiesa, and, sonata, da, camera, then, tended, to, be, freely, intermixed, although, nearly, half, of, johann, sebastian, bach, s, 1, 100, surviving, compositions, arrangements, and, transcriptions, are, instrumental, works, only, about, 4, are, sonatas, the, term, sonata, is, also, applied, to, the, series, of, over, 500, works, for, harpsichord, solo, or, sometimes, for, other, keyboard, instruments, by, domenico, scarlatti, originally, published, under, the, name, essercizi, per, il, gravicembalo, exercises, for, the, harpsichord, most, of, these, pieces, are, in, one, binary, form, movement, only, with, two, parts, that, are, in, the, same, tempo, and, use, the, same, thematic, material, though, occasionally, there, will, be, changes, in, tempo, within, the, sections, they, are, frequently, virtuosic, and, use, more, distant, harmonic, transitions, and, modulations, than, were, common, for, other, works, of, the, time, they, were, admired, for, their, great, variety, and, invention, both, the, solo, and, trio, sonatas, of, vivaldi, show, parallels, with, the, concerti, he, was, writing, at, the, same, time, he, composed, over, 70, sonatas, the, great, majority, of, which, are, of, the, solo, type, most, of, the, rest, are, trio, sonatas, and, a, very, small, number, are, of, the, multivoice, type, the, sonatas, of, domenico, paradies, are, mild, and, elongated, works, with, a, graceful, and, melodious, little, second, movement, included, the, practice, of, the, classical, period, would, become, decisive, for, the, sonata, the, term, moved, from, being, one, of, many, terms, indicating, genres, or, forms, to, designating, the, fundamental, form, of, organization, for, large, scale, works, this, evolution, stretched, over, fifty, years, the, term, came, to, apply, both, to, the, structure, of, individual, movements, see, sonata, form, and, history, of, sonata, form, and, to, the, layout, of, the, movements, in, a, multi, movement, work, in, the, transition, to, the, classical, period, there, were, several, names, given, to, multimovement, works, including, divertimento, serenade, and, partita, many, of, which, are, now, regarded, effectively, as, sonatas, the, usage, of, sonata, as, the, standard, term, for, such, works, began, somewhere, in, the, 1770s, haydn, labels, his, first, piano, sonata, as, such, in, 1771, after, which, the, term, divertimento, is, used, sparingly, in, his, output, the, term, sonata, was, increasingly, applied, to, either, a, work, for, keyboard, alone, see, piano, sonata, or, for, keyboard, and, one, other, instrument, often, the, violin, or, cello, it, was, less, and, less, frequently, applied, to, works, with, more, than, two, instrumentalists, for, example, piano, trios, were, not, often, labelled, sonata, for, piano, violin, and, cello, initially, the, most, common, layout, of, movements, was, however, two, movement, layouts, also, occur, a, practice, haydn, uses, as, late, as, the, 1790s, there, was, also, in, the, early, classical, period, the, possibility, of, using, four, movements, with, a, dance, movement, inserted, before, the, slow, movement, as, in, haydn, s, piano, sonatas, no, 6, and, no, 8, mozart, s, sonatas, were, also, primarily, in, three, movements, of, the, works, that, haydn, labelled, piano, sonata, divertimento, or, partita, in, hob, xiv, seven, are, in, two, movements, thirty, five, are, in, three, and, three, are, in, four, and, there, are, several, in, three, or, four, movements, whose, authenticity, is, listed, as, doubtful, composers, such, as, boccherini, would, publish, sonatas, for, piano, and, obbligato, instrument, with, an, optional, third, movement, in, boccherini, s, case, 28, cello, sonatas, but, increasingly, instrumental, works, were, laid, out, in, four, not, three, movements, a, practice, seen, first, in, string, quartets, and, symphonies, and, reaching, the, sonata, proper, in, the, early, sonatas, of, beethoven, however, two, and, three, movement, sonatas, continued, to, be, written, throughout, the, classical, period, beethoven, s, opus, 102, pair, has, a, two, movement, c, major, sonata, and, a, three, movement, d, major, sonata, nevertheless, works, with, fewer, or, more, than, four, movements, were, increasingly, felt, to, be, exceptions, they, were, labelled, as, having, movements, omitted, or, as, having, extra, movements, thus, the, four, movement, layout, was, by, this, point, standard, for, the, string, quartet, and, overwhelmingly, the, most, common, for, the, symphony, the, usual, order, of, the, four, movements, was, when, movements, appeared, out, of, this, order, they, would, be, described, as, reversed, such, as, the, scherzo, coming, before, the, slow, movement, in, beethoven, s, 9th, symphony, this, usage, would, be, noted, by, critics, in, the, early, 19th, century, and, it, was, codified, into, teaching, soon, thereafter, it, is, difficult, to, overstate, the, importance, of, beethoven, s, output, of, sonatas, 32, piano, sonatas, plus, sonatas, for, cello, and, piano, or, violin, and, piano, forming, a, large, body, of, music, that, would, over, time, increasingly, be, thought, essential, for, any, serious, instrumentalist, to, master, in, the, early, 19th, century, the, current, usage, of, the, term, sonata, was, established, both, as, regards, form, per, se, and, in, the, sense, that, a, fully, elaborated, sonata, serves, as, a, norm, for, concert, music, in, general, which, other, forms, are, seen, in, relation, to, from, this, point, forward, the, word, sonata, in, music, theory, labels, as, much, the, abstract, musical, form, as, particular, works, hence, there, are, references, to, a, symphony, as, a, sonata, for, orchestra, this, is, referred, to, by, william, newman, as, the, sonata, idea, among, works, expressly, labeled, sonata, for, the, piano, there, are, the, three, of, fr, d, ric, chopin, those, of, felix, mendelssohn, the, three, of, robert, schumann, franz, liszt, s, sonata, in, b, minor, and, later, the, sonatas, of, johannes, brahms, and, sergei, rachmaninoff, in, the, early, 19th, century, the, sonata, form, was, defined, from, a, combination, of, previous, practice, and, the, works, of, important, classical, composers, particularly, haydn, mozart, beethoven, but, composers, such, as, clementi, also, it, is, during, this, period, that, the, differences, between, the, three, and, the, four, movement, layouts, became, a, subject, of, commentary, with, emphasis, on, the, concerto, being, laid, out, in, three, movements, and, the, symphony, in, four, ernest, newman, wrote, in, the, essay, brahms, and, the, serpent, the, role, of, the, sonata, as, an, extremely, important, form, of, extended, musical, argument, would, inspire, composers, such, as, hindemith, prokofiev, shostakovich, tailleferre, ustvolskaya, and, williams, to, compose, in, sonata, form, and, works, with, traditional, sonata, structures, continue, to, be, composed, and, performed, research, into, the, practice, and, meaning, of, sonata, form, style, and, structure, has, been, the, motivation, for, important, theoretical, works, by, heinrich, schenker, arnold, schoenberg, and, charles, rosen, among, others, and, the, pedagogy, of, music, continued, to, rest, on, an, understanding, and, application, of, the, rules, of, sonata, form, as, almost, two, centuries, of, development, in, practice, and, theory, had, codified, it, the, development, of, the, classical, style, and, its, norms, of, composition, formed, the, basis, for, much, of, the, music, theory, of, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, as, an, overarching, formal, principle, sonata, was, accorded, the, same, central, status, as, baroque, fugue, generations, of, composers, instrumentalists, and, audiences, were, guided, by, this, understanding, of, sonata, as, an, enduring, and, dominant, principle, in, western, music, the, sonata, idea, begins, before, the, term, had, taken, on, its, present, importance, along, with, the, evolution, of, the, classical, period, s, changing, norms, the, reasons, for, these, changes, and, how, they, relate, to, the, evolving, sense, of, a, new, formal, order, in, music, is, a, matter, to, which, research, is, devoted, some, common, factors, which, were, pointed, to, include, the, shift, of, focus, from, vocal, music, to, instrumental, music, changes, in, performance, practice, including, the, loss, of, the, continuo, crucial, to, most, interpretations, of, the, sonata, form, is, the, idea, of, a, tonal, center, and, as, the, grove, concise, dictionary, of, music, puts, it, the, main, form, of, the, group, embodying, the, sonata, principle, the, most, important, principle, of, musical, structure, from, the, classical, period, to, the, 20th, century, that, material, first, stated, in, a, complementary, key, be, restated, in, the, home, key, the, sonata, idea, has, been, thoroughly, explored, by, william, newman, in, his, monumental, three, volume, work, sonata, in, the, classic, era, a, history, of, the, sonata, idea, begun, in, the, 1950s, and, published, in, what, has, become, the, standard, edition, of, all, three, volumes, in, 1972, heinrich, schenker, argued, that, there, was, an, urlinie, or, basic, tonal, melody, and, a, basic, bass, figuration, he, held, that, when, these, two, were, present, there, was, basic, structure, and, that, the, sonata, represented, this, basic, structure, in, a, whole, work, with, a, process, known, as, interruption, as, a, practical, matter, schenker, applied, his, ideas, to, the, editing, of, the, piano, sonatas, of, beethoven, using, original, manuscripts, and, his, own, theories, to, correct, the, available, sources, the, basic, procedure, was, the, use, of, tonal, theory, to, infer, meaning, from, available, sources, as, part, of, the, critical, process, even, to, the, extent, of, completing, works, left, unfinished, by, their, composers, while, many, of, these, changes, were, and, are, controversial, that, procedure, has, a, central, role, today, in, music, theory, and, is, an, essential, part, of, the, theory, of, sonata, structure, as, taught, in, most, music, schools, sources
