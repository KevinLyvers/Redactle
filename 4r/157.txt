gives, a, brief, outline, of, his, life, and, history, before, his, voyages, during, his, first, voyage, gulliver, is, washed, ashore, after, a, shipwreck, and, finds, himself, a, prisoner, of, a, race, of, tiny, people, less, than, 6, inches, 15, cm, tall, much, like, the, little, people, in, mythology, who, are, inhabitants, of, the, island, country, of, lilliput, after, giving, assurances, of, his, good, behaviour, he, is, given, a, residence, in, lilliput, and, becomes, a, favourite, of, the, lilliput, royal, court, he, is, also, given, permission, by, the, king, of, lilliput, to, go, around, the, city, on, the, condition, that, he, must, not, hurt, their, subjects, at, first, the, lilliputians, are, hospitable, to, gulliver, but, they, are, also, wary, of, the, threat, that, his, size, poses, to, them, the, lilliputians, reveal, themselves, to, be, a, people, who, put, great, emphasis, on, trivial, matters, for, example, which, end, of, an, egg, a, person, cracks, becomes, the, basis, of, a, deep, political, rift, within, that, nation, they, are, a, people, who, revel, in, displays, of, authority, and, performances, of, power, gulliver, assists, the, lilliputians, to, subdue, their, neighbours, the, blefuscudians, by, stealing, their, fleet, however, he, refuses, to, reduce, the, island, nation, of, blefuscu, to, a, province, of, lilliput, displeasing, the, king,

is, blown, off, course, by, storms, and, forced, to, sail, for, land, in, search, of, fresh, water, gulliver, is, abandoned, by, his, companions, and, left, on, a, peninsula, on, the, western, coast, of, the, north, american, continent, the, grass, of, brobdingnag, is, as, tall, as, a, tree, he, is, then, found, by, a, farmer, who, is, about, 72, ft, 22, m, tall, judging, from, gulliver,

and, exhibits, him, for, money, after, a, while, the, constant, display, makes, gulliver, sick, and, the, farmer, sells, him, to, the, queen, of, the, realm, glumdalclitch, who, accompanied, her, father, while, exhibiting, gulliver, is, taken, into, the, queen, s, service, to, take, care, of, the, tiny, man, since, gulliver, is, too, small, to, use, their, huge, chairs, beds, knives, and, forks, the, queen, commissions, a, small, house, to, be, built, for, him, so, that, he, can, be, carried, around, in, it, this, is, referred, to, as, his, travelling, box, between, small, adventures, such, as, fighting, giant, wasps, and, being, carried, to, the, roof, by, a, monkey, he, discusses, the, state, of, europe, with, the, king, of, brobdingnag, the, king, is, not, happy, with, gulliver, s, accounts, of, europe, especially, upon, learning, of, the, use, of, guns, and, cannon, on, a, trip, to, the, seaside, his, traveling, box, is, seized, by, a, giant, eagle, which, drops, gulliver, and, his, box, into, the, sea, where, he, is, picked, up, by, sailors, who, return, him, to, england, setting, out, again, gulliver, s, ship, is, attacked, by, pirates, and, he, is, marooned, close, to, a, desolate, rocky, island, near, india, he, is, rescued, by, the, flying, island, of, laputa, a, kingdom, devoted, to, the, arts, of, music, mathematics, and, astronomy, but, unable, to, use, them, for, practical, ends, rather, than, using, armies, laputa, has, a, custom, of, throwing, rocks, down, at, rebellious, cities, on, the, ground, gulliver, tours, balnibarbi, the, kingdom, ruled, from, laputa, as, the, guest, of, a, low, ranking, courtier, and, sees, the, ruin, brought, about, by, the, blind, pursuit, of, science, without, practical, results, in, a, satire, on, bureaucracy, and, on, the, royal, society, and, its, experiments, at, the, grand, academy, of, lagado, in, balnibarbi, great, resources, and, manpower, are, employed, on, researching, preposterous, schemes, such, as, extracting, sunbeams, from, cucumbers, softening, marble, for, use, in, pillows, learning, how, to, mix, paint, by, smell, and, uncovering, political, conspiracies, by, examining, the, excrement, of, suspicious, persons, gulliver, refers, in, passing, to, his, visit, to, tribnia, that, is, britain, called, by, some, langden, that, is, england, where, the, main, occupations, are, plotting, and, informing, gulliver, is, then, taken, to, maldonada, the, main, port, of, balnibarbi, to, await, a, trader, who, can, take, him, on, to, japan, while, waiting, for, a, passage, gulliver, takes, a, short, side, trip, to, the, island, of, glubbdubdrib, which, is, southwest, of, balnibarbi, on, glubbdubdrib, he, visits, a, magician, s, dwelling, and, discusses, history, with, the, ghosts, of, historical, figures, the, most, obvious, restatement, of, the, ancients, versus, moderns, theme, in, the, book, the, ghosts, include, julius, caesar, brutus, homer, aristotle, ren, descartes, and, pierre, gassendi, on, the, island, of, luggnagg, he, encounters, the, struldbrugs, people, who, are, immortal, they, do, not, have, the, gift, of, eternal, youth, but, suffer, the, infirmities, of, old, age, and, are, considered, legally, dead, at, the, age, of, eighty, after, reaching, japan, gulliver, asks, the, emperor, to, excuse, my, performing, the, ceremony, imposed, upon, my, countrymen, of, trampling, upon, the, crucifix, which, the, emperor, does, gulliver, returns, home, determined, to, stay, there, for, the, rest, of, his, days, despite, his, earlier, intention, of, remaining, at, home, gulliver, returns, to, sea, as, the, captain, of, a, merchantman, as, he, is, bored, with, his, employment, as, a, surgeon, on, this, voyage, he, is, forced, to, find, new, additions, to, his, crew, who, he, believes, have, turned, against, him, his, crew, then, commits, mutiny, after, keeping, him, contained, for, some, time, they, resolve, to, leave, him, on, the, first, piece, of, land, they, come, across, and, continue, as, pirates, he, is, abandoned, in, a, landing, boat, and, comes, upon, a, race, of, deformed, savage, humanoid, creatures, to, which, he, conceives, a, violent, antipathy, shortly, afterwards, he, meets, the, houyhnhnms, a, race, of, talking, horses, they, are, the, rulers, while, the, deformed, creatures, that, resemble, human, beings, are, called, yahoos, some, scholars, have, identified, the, relationship, between, the, houyhnhnms, and, yahoos, as, a, master, slave, dynamic, gulliver, becomes, a, member, of, a, horse, s, household, and, comes, to, both, admire, and, emulate, the, houyhnhnms, and, their, way, of, life, rejecting, his, fellow, humans, as, merely, yahoos, endowed, with, some, semblance, of, reason, which, they, only, use, to, exacerbate, and, add, to, the, vices, nature, gave, them, however, an, assembly, of, the, houyhnhnms, rules, that, gulliver, a, yahoo, with, some, semblance, of, reason, is, a, danger, to, their, civilization, and, commands, him, to, swim, back, to, the, land, that, he, came, from, gulliver, s, master, the, houyhnhnm, who, took, him, into, his, household, buys, him, time, to, create, a, canoe, to, make, his, departure, easier, after, another, disastrous, voyage, he, is, rescued, against, his, will, by, a, portuguese, ship, he, is, disgusted, to, see, that, captain, pedro, de, mendez, whom, he, considers, a, yahoo, is, a, wise, courteous, and, generous, person, he, returns, to, his, home, in, england, but, is, unable, to, reconcile, himself, to, living, among, yahoos, and, becomes, a, recluse, remaining, in, his, house, avoiding, his, family, and, his, wife, and, spending, several, hours, a, day, speaking, with, the, horses, in, his, stables, it, is, uncertain, exactly, when, swift, started, writing, gulliver, s, travels, much, of, the, writing, was, done, at, loughry, manor, in, cookstown, county, tyrone, whilst, swift, stayed, there, some, sources, suggest, as, early, as, 1713, when, swift, gay, pope, arbuthnot, and, others, formed, the, scriblerus, club, with, the, aim, of, satirising, popular, literary, genres, according, to, these, accounts, swift, was, charged, with, writing, the, memoirs, of, the, club, s, imaginary, author, martinus, scriblerus, and, also, with, satirising, the, travellers, tales, literary, subgenre, it, is, known, from, swift, s, correspondence, that, the, composition, proper, began, in, 1720, with, the, mirror, themed, parts, i, and, ii, written, first, part, iv, next, in, 1723, and, part, iii, written, in, 1724, but, amendments, were, made, even, while, swift, was, writing, drapier, s, letters, by, august, 1725, the, book, was, complete, and, as, gulliver, s, travels, was, a, transparently, anti, whig, satire, it, is, likely, that, swift, had, the, manuscript, copied, so, that, his, handwriting, could, not, be, used, as, evidence, if, a, prosecution, should, arise, as, had, happened, in, the, case, of, some, of, his, irish, pamphlets, the, drapier, s, letters, in, march, 1726, swift, travelled, to, london, to, have, his, work, published, the, manuscript, was, secretly, delivered, to, the, publisher, benjamin, motte, who, used, five, printing, houses, to, speed, production, and, avoid, piracy, motte, recognising, a, best, seller, but, fearing, prosecution, cut, or, altered, the, worst, offending, passages, such, as, the, descriptions, of, the, court, contests, in, lilliput, and, the, rebellion, of, lindalino, added, some, material, in, defence, of, queen, anne, to, part, ii, and, published, it, the, first, edition, was, released, in, two, volumes, on, 28, october, 1726, priced, at, 8, s, 6, d, motte, published, gulliver, s, travels, anonymously, and, as, was, often, the, way, with, fashionable, works, several, follow, ups, memoirs, of, the, court, of, lilliput, parodies, two, lilliputian, odes, the, first, on, the, famous, engine, with, which, captain, gulliver, extinguish, d, the, palace, fire, and, keys, gulliver, decipher, d, and, lemuel, gulliver, s, travels, into, several, remote, regions, of, the, world, compendiously, methodiz, d, the, second, by, edmund, curll, who, had, similarly, written, a, key, to, swift, s, tale, of, a, tub, in, 1705, were, swiftly, produced, these, were, mostly, printed, anonymously, or, occasionally, pseudonymously, and, were, quickly, forgotten, swift, had, nothing, to, do, with, them, and, disavowed, them, in, faulkner, s, edition, of, 1735, swift, s, friend, alexander, pope, wrote, a, set, of, five, verses, on, gulliver, s, travels, which, swift, liked, so, much, that, he, added, them, to, the, second, edition, of, the, book, though, they, are, rarely, included, in, modern, editions, in, 1735, an, irish, publisher, george, faulkner, printed, a, set, of, swift, s, works, volume, iii, of, which, was, gulliver, s, travels, as, revealed, in, faulkner, s, advertisement, to, the, reader, faulkner, had, access, to, an, annotated, copy, of, motte, s, work, by, a, friend, of, the, author, generally, believed, to, be, swift, s, friend, charles, ford, which, reproduced, most, of, the, manuscript, without, motte, s, amendments, the, original, manuscript, having, been, destroyed, it, is, also, believed, that, swift, at, least, reviewed, proofs, of, faulkner, s, edition, before, printing, but, this, cannot, be, proved, generally, this, is, regarded, as, the, editio, princeps, of, gulliver, s, travels, with, one, small, exception, this, edition, had, an, added, piece, by, swift, a, letter, from, capt, gulliver, to, his, cousin, sympson, which, complained, of, motte, s, alterations, to, the, original, text, saying, he, had, so, much, altered, it, that, i, do, hardly, know, mine, own, work, and, repudiating, all, of, motte, s, changes, as, well, as, all, the, keys, libels, parodies, second, parts, and, continuations, that, had, appeared, in, the, intervening, years, this, letter, now, forms, part, of, many, standard, texts, the, five, paragraph, episode, in, part, iii, telling, of, the, rebellion, of, the, surface, city, of, lindalino, against, the, flying, island, of, laputa, was, an, allegory, of, the, affair, of, drapier, s, letters, of, which, swift, was, proud, lindalino, represented, dublin, and, the, impositions, of, laputa, represented, the, british, imposition, of, william, wood, s, poor, quality, copper, currency, faulkner, had, omitted, this, passage, either, because, of, political, sensitivities, raised, by, an, irish, publisher, printing, an, anti, british, satire, or, possibly, because, the, text, he, worked, from, did, not, include, the, passage, in, 1899, the, passage, was, included, in, a, new, edition, of, the, collected, works, modern, editions, derive, from, the, faulkner, edition, with, the, inclusion, of, this, 1899, addendum, isaac, asimov, notes, in, the, annotated, gulliver, that, lindalino, is, generally, taken, to, be, dublin, being, composed, of, double, l, i, n, s, hence, dublin, gulliver, s, travels, has, been, described, as, a, menippean, satire, a, children, s, story, proto, science, fiction, and, a, forerunner, of, the, modern, novel, published, seven, years, after, daniel, defoe, s, successful, robinson, crusoe, gulliver, s, travels, may, be, read, as, a, systematic, rebuttal, of, defoe, s, optimistic, account, of, human, capability, in, the, unthinkable, swift, the, spontaneous, philosophy, of, a, church, of, england, man, warren, montag, argues, that, swift, was, concerned, to, refute, the, notion, that, the, individual, precedes, society, as, defoe, s, work, seems, to, suggest, swift, regarded, such, thought, as, a, dangerous, endorsement, of, thomas, hobbes, radical, political, philosophy, and, for, this, reason, gulliver, repeatedly, encounters, established, societies, rather, than, desolate, islands, the, captain, who, invites, gulliver, to, serve, as, a, surgeon, aboard, his, ship, on, the, disastrous, third, voyage, is, named, robinson, allan, bloom, asserts, that, swift, s, lampooning, of, the, experiments, of, laputa, is, the, first, questioning, by, a, modern, liberal, democrat, of, the, effects, and, cost, on, a, society, which, embraces, and, celebrates, policies, pursuing, scientific, progress, swift, wrote, the, first, man, i, saw, was, of, a, meagre, aspect, with, sooty, hands, and, face, his, hair, and, beard, long, ragged, and, singed, in, several, places, his, clothes, shirt, and, skin, were, all, of, the, same, colour, he, has, been, eight, years, upon, a, project, for, extracting, sunbeams, out, of, cucumbers, which, were, to, be, put, in, phials, hermetically, sealed, and, let, out, to, warm, the, air, in, raw, inclement, summers, he, told, me, he, did, not, doubt, that, in, eight, years, more, he, should, be, able, to, supply, the, governor, s, gardens, with, sunshine, at, a, reasonable, rate, but, he, complained, that, his, stock, was, low, and, entreated, me, to, give, him, something, as, an, encouragement, to, ingenuity, especially, since, this, had, been, a, very, dear, season, for, cucumbers, i, made, him, a, small, present, for, my, lord, had, furnished, me, with, money, on, purpose, because, he, knew, their, practice, of, begging, from, all, who, go, to, see, them, a, possible, reason, for, the, book, s, classic, status, is, that, it, can, be, seen, as, many, things, to, many, people, broadly, the, book, has, three, themes, in, storytelling, and, construction, the, parts, follow, a, pattern, although, swift, is, often, accused, of, misogyny, in, this, work, many, scholars, believe, gulliver, s, blatant, misogyny, to, be, intentional, and, that, swift, uses, satire, to, openly, mock, misogyny, throughout, the, book, one, of, the, most, cited, examples, of, this, comes, from, gulliver, s, description, of, a, brobdingnagian, woman, i, must, confess, no, object, ever, disgusted, me, so, much, as, the, sight, of, her, monstrous, breast, which, i, cannot, tell, what, to, compare, with, so, as, to, give, the, curious, reader, an, idea, of, its, bulk, shape, and, colour, this, made, me, reflect, upon, the, fair, skins, of, our, english, ladies, who, appear, so, beautiful, to, us, only, because, they, are, of, our, own, size, and, their, defects, not, to, be, seen, but, through, a, magnifying, glass, this, open, critique, towards, aspects, of, the, female, body, is, something, that, swift, often, brings, up, in, other, works, of, his, particularly, in, poems, such, as, the, lady, s, dressing, room, and, a, beautiful, young, nymph, going, to, bed, a, criticism, of, swift, s, use, of, misogyny, by, felicity, a, nussbaum, proposes, the, idea, that, gulliver, himself, is, a, gendered, object, of, satire, and, his, antifeminist, sentiments, may, be, among, those, mocked, gulliver, s, own, masculinity, is, often, mocked, seen, in, how, he, is, made, to, be, a, coward, among, the, brobdingnag, people, repressed, by, the, people, of, lilliput, and, viewed, as, an, inferior, yahoo, among, the, houyhnhnms, nussbaum, goes, on, to, say, in, her, analysis, of, the, misogyny, of, the, stories, that, in, the, adventures, particularly, in, the, first, story, the, satire, is, not, singularly, focused, on, satirizing, women, but, to, satirize, gulliver, himself, as, a, politically, naive, and, inept, giant, whose, masculine, authority, comically, seems, to, be, in, jeopardy, another, criticism, of, swift, s, use, of, misogyny, delves, into, gulliver, s, repeated, use, of, the, word, nauseous, and, the, way, that, gulliver, is, fighting, his, emasculation, by, commenting, on, how, he, thinks, the, women, of, brobdingnag, are, disgusting, swift, has, gulliver, frequently, invoke, the, sensory, as, opposed, to, reflective, word, nauseous, to, describe, this, and, other, magnified, images, in, brobdingnag, not, only, to, reveal, the, neurotic, depths, of, gulliver, s, misogyny, but, also, to, show, how, male, nausea, can, be, used, as, a, pathetic, countermeasure, against, the, perceived, threat, of, female, consumption, swift, has, gulliver, associate, these, magnified, acts, of, female, consumption, with, the, act, of, throwing, up, the, opposite, of, and, antidote, to, the, act, of, gastronomic, consumption, this, commentary, of, deborah, needleman, armintor, relies, upon, the, way, that, the, giant, women, do, with, gulliver, as, they, please, in, much, the, same, way, as, one, might, play, with, a, toy, and, get, it, to, do, everything, one, can, think, of, armintor, s, comparison, focuses, on, the, pocket, microscopes, that, were, popular, in, swift, s, time, she, talks, about, how, this, instrument, of, science, was, transitioned, to, something, toy, like, and, accessible, so, it, shifted, into, something, that, women, favored, and, thus, men, lost, interest, this, is, similar, to, the, progression, of, gulliver, s, time, in, brobdingnag, from, man, of, science, to, women, s, plaything, misanthropy, is, a, theme, that, scholars, have, identified, in, gulliver, s, travels, arthur, case, r, s, crane, and, edward, stone, discuss, gulliver, s, development, of, misanthropy, and, come, to, the, consensus, that, this, theme, ought, to, be, viewed, as, comical, rather, than, cynical, in, terms, of, gulliver, s, development, of, misanthropy, these, three, scholars, point, to, the, fourth, voyage, according, to, case, gulliver, is, at, first, averse, to, identifying, with, the, yahoos, but, after, he, deems, the, houyhnhnms, superior, he, comes, to, believe, that, humans, including, his, fellow, europeans, are, yahoos, due, to, their, shortcomings, perceiving, the, houyhnhnms, as, perfect, gulliver, thus, begins, to, perceive, himself, and, the, rest, of, humanity, as, imperfect, according, to, crane, when, gulliver, develops, his, misanthropic, mindset, he, becomes, ashamed, of, humans, and, views, them, more, in, line, with, animals, this, new, perception, of, gulliver, s, stone, claims, comes, about, because, the, houyhnhnms, judgement, pushes, gulliver, to, identify, with, the, yahoos, along, similar, lines, crane, holds, that, gulliver, s, misanthropy, is, developed, in, part, when, he, talks, to, the, houyhnhnms, about, mankind, because, the, discussions, lead, him, to, reflect, on, his, previously, held, notion, of, humanity, specifically, gulliver, s, master, who, is, a, houyhnhnm, provides, questions, and, commentary, that, contribute, to, gulliver, s, reflectiveness, and, subsequent, development, of, misanthropy, however, case, points, out, that, gulliver, s, dwindling, opinion, of, humans, may, be, blown, out, of, proportion, due, to, the, fact, that, he, is, no, longer, able, to, see, the, good, qualities, that, humans, are, capable, of, possessing, gulliver, s, new, view, of, humanity, then, creates, his, repulsive, attitude, towards, his, fellow, humans, after, leaving, houyhnhnmland, but, in, stone, s, view, gulliver, s, actions, and, attitude, upon, his, return, can, be, interpreted, as, misanthropy, that, is, exaggerated, for, comic, effect, rather, than, for, a, cynical, effect, stone, further, suggests, that, gulliver, goes, mentally, mad, and, believes, that, this, is, what, leads, gulliver, to, exaggerate, the, shortcomings, of, humankind, another, aspect, that, crane, attributes, to, gulliver, s, development, of, misanthropy, is, that, when, in, houyhnhnmland, it, is, the, animal, like, beings, the, houyhnhnms, who, exhibit, reason, and, the, human, like, beings, the, yahoos, who, seem, devoid, of, reason, crane, argues, that, it, is, this, switch, from, gulliver, s, perceived, norm, that, leads, the, way, for, him, to, question, his, view, of, humanity, as, a, result, gulliver, begins, to, identify, humans, as, a, type, of, yahoo, to, this, point, crane, brings, up, the, fact, that, a, traditional, definition, of, man, homo, est, animal, rationale, humans, are, rational, animals, was, prominent, in, academia, around, swift, s, time, furthermore, crane, argues, that, swift, had, to, study, this, type, of, logic, see, porphyrian, tree, in, college, so, it, is, highly, likely, that, he, intentionally, inverted, this, logic, by, placing, the, typically, given, example, of, irrational, beings, horses, in, the, place, of, humans, and, vice, versa, stone, points, out, that, gulliver, s, travels, takes, a, cue, from, the, genre, of, the, travel, book, which, was, popular, during, swift, s, time, period, from, reading, travel, books, swift, s, contemporaries, were, accustomed, to, beast, like, figures, of, foreign, places, thus, stone, holds, that, the, creation, of, the, yahoos, was, not, out, of, the, ordinary, for, the, time, period, from, this, playing, off, of, familiar, genre, expectations, stone, deduces, that, the, parallels, that, swift, draws, between, the, yahoos, and, humans, is, meant, to, be, humorous, rather, than, cynical, even, though, gulliver, sees, yahoos, and, humans, as, if, they, are, one, and, the, same, stone, argues, that, swift, did, not, intend, for, readers, to, take, on, gulliver, s, view, stone, states, that, the, yahoos, behaviors, and, characteristics, that, set, them, apart, from, humans, further, supports, the, notion, that, gulliver, s, identification, with, yahoos, is, not, meant, to, be, taken, to, heart, thus, stone, sees, gulliver, s, perceived, superiority, of, the, houyhnhnms, and, subsequent, misanthropy, as, features, that, swift, used, to, employ, the, satirical, and, humorous, elements, characteristic, of, the, beast, fables, of, travel, books, that, were, popular, with, his, contemporaries, as, swift, did, these, beast, fables, placed, animals, above, humans, in, terms, of, morals, and, reason, but, they, were, not, meant, to, be, taken, literally, pedro, de, mendez, is, the, name, of, the, portuguese, captain, who, rescues, gulliver, in, book, iv, when, gulliver, is, forced, to, leave, the, island, of, the, houyhnhnms, his, plan, is, to, discover, some, small, island, uninhabited, where, he, can, live, in, solitude, instead, he, is, picked, up, by, don, pedro, s, crew, despite, gulliver, s, appearance, he, is, dressed, in, skins, and, speaks, like, a, horse, don, pedro, treats, him, compassionately, and, returns, him, to, lisbon, though, don, pedro, appears, only, briefly, he, has, become, an, important, figure, in, the, debate, between, so, called, soft, school, and, hard, school, readers, of, gulliver, s, travels, some, critics, contend, that, gulliver, is, a, target, of, swift, s, satire, and, that, don, pedro, represents, an, ideal, of, human, kindness, and, generosity, gulliver, believes, humans, are, similar, to, yahoos, in, the, sense, that, they, make, no, other, use, of, reason, than, to, improve, and, multiply, vices, captain, pedro, provides, a, contrast, to, gulliver, s, reasoning, proving, humans, are, able, to, reason, be, kind, and, most, of, all, civilized, gulliver, sees, the, bleak, fallenness, at, the, center, of, human, nature, and, don, pedro, is, merely, a, minor, character, who, in, gulliver, s, words, is, an, animal, which, had, some, little, portion, of, reason, part, i, is, probably, responsible, for, the, greatest, number, of, political, allusions, one, of, the, most, commonly, noted, parallels, is, that, the, wars, between, lilliput, and, blefuscu, resemble, those, between, england, and, france, the, enmity, between, the, low, heels, and, the, high, heels, is, often, interpreted, as, a, parody, of, the, whigs, and, tories, and, the, character, referred, to, as, flimnap, is, often, interpreted, as, an, allusion, to, sir, robert, walpole, a, british, statesman, and, whig, politician, who, swift, had, a, personally, turbulent, relationship, with, in, part, iii, the, grand, academy, of, lagado, in, balnibarbi, resembles, and, satirizes, the, royal, society, which, swift, was, openly, critical, of, furthermore, a, e, case, acting, on, a, tipoff, offered, by, the, word, projectors, found, to, be, the, hiding, place, of, many, of, those, speculators, implicated, in, the, south, sea, bubble, according, to, treadwell, however, these, implications, extend, beyond, the, speculators, of, the, south, sea, bubble, to, include, the, many, projectors, of, the, late, seventeenth, and, early, eighteenth, century, england, including, swift, himself, not, only, is, swift, satirizing, the, role, of, the, projector, in, contemporary, english, politics, which, he, dabbled, in, during, his, younger, years, but, the, role, of, the, satirist, whose, goals, align, with, that, of, a, projector, the, less, obvious, corollary, of, that, word, is, that, it, must, include, the, poor, deluded, satirist, himself, since, satire, is, in, its, very, essence, the, wildest, of, all, projects, a, scheme, to, reform, the, world, ann, kelly, describes, part, iv, of, the, travels, and, the, yahoo, houyhnhnm, relationship, as, an, allusion, to, that, of, the, irish, and, the, british, the, term, that, swift, uses, to, describe, the, oppression, in, both, ireland, and, houyhnhnmland, is, slavery, this, is, not, an, accidental, word, choice, for, swift, was, well, aware, of, the, complicated, moral, and, philosophical, questions, raised, by, the, emotional, designation, slavery, the, misery, of, the, irish, in, the, early, eighteenth, century, shocked, swift, and, all, others, who, witnessed, it, the, hopeless, passivity, of, the, people, in, this, desolate, land, made, it, seem, as, if, both, the, minds, and, bodies, of, the, irish, were, enslaved, kelly, goes, on, to, write, throughout, the, irish, tracts, and, poems, swift, continually, vacillates, as, to, whether, the, irish, are, servile, because, of, some, defect, within, their, character, or, whether, their, sordid, condition, is, the, result, of, a, calculated, policy, from, without, to, reduce, them, to, brutishness, although, no, one, has, done, so, similar, questions, could, be, asked, about, the, yahoos, who, are, slaves, to, the, houyhnhnms, however, kelly, does, not, suggest, a, wholesale, equivalence, between, irish, and, yahoos, which, would, be, reductive, and, omit, the, various, other, layers, of, satire, at, work, in, this, section, part, i, includes, examples, of, the, lilliputian, language, including, a, paragraph, for, which, gulliver, provides, a, translation, in, his, annotated, edition, of, the, book, published, in, 1980, isaac, asimov, claims, that, making, sense, out, of, the, words, and, phrases, introduced, by, swift, is, a, waste, of, time, and, these, words, were, invented, nonsense, however, irving, rothman, a, professor, at, university, of, houston, points, out, that, the, language, may, have, been, derived, from, hebrew, which, swift, had, studied, at, trinity, college, dublin, the, book, was, very, popular, upon, release, and, was, commonly, discussed, within, social, circles, public, reception, widely, varied, with, the, book, receiving, an, initially, enthusiastic, reaction, with, readers, praising, its, satire, and, some, reporting, that, the, satire, s, cleverness, sounded, like, a, realistic, account, of, a, man, s, travels, james, beattie, commended, swift, s, work, for, its, truth, regarding, the, narration, and, claims, that, the, statesman, the, philosopher, and, the, critick, will, admire, his, keenness, of, satire, energy, of, description, and, vivacity, of, language, noting, that, even, children, can, enjoy, the, novel, as, popularity, increased, critics, came, to, appreciate, the, deeper, aspects, of, gulliver, s, travels, it, became, known, for, its, insightful, take, on, morality, expanding, its, reputation, beyond, just, humorous, satire, despite, its, initial, positive, reception, the, book, faced, backlash, viscount, bolingbroke, a, friend, of, swift, and, one, of, the, first, critics, of, the, book, criticised, the, author, for, his, overt, use, of, misanthropy, other, negative, responses, to, the, book, also, looked, towards, its, portrayal, of, humanity, which, was, considered, inaccurate, swifts, s, peers, rejected, the, book, on, claims, that, its, themes, of, misanthropy, were, harmful, and, offensive, they, criticized, its, satire, for, exceeding, what, was, deemed, acceptable, and, appropriate, including, the, houyhnhnms, and, yahoos, s, similarities, to, humans, there, was, also, controversy, surrounding, the, political, allegories, readers, enjoyed, the, political, references, finding, them, humorous, however, members, of, the, whig, party, were, offended, believing, that, swift, mocked, their, politics, british, novelist, and, journalist, william, makepeace, thackeray, described, swift, s, work, as, blasphemous, saying, its, critical, view, of, mankind, was, ludicrous, and, overly, harsh, he, concluded, that, he, could, not, understand, the, origins, of, swift, s, critiques, on, humanity, the, term, lilliputian, has, entered, many, languages, as, an, adjective, meaning, small, and, delicate, there, is, a, brand, of,

gulliver, s, travels, in, the, discipline, of, computer, architecture, the, terms, big, endian, and, little, endian, are, used, to, describe, two, possible, ways, of, laying, out, bytes, of, data, in, computer, memory, the, terms, derive, from, one, of, the, satirical, conflicts, in, the, book, in, which, two, religious, sects, of, lilliputians, are, divided, between, those, who, crack, open, their, soft, boiled, eggs, from, the, little, end, the, little, endians, and, those, who, use, the, big, end, the, big, endians, the, nomenclature, was, chosen, as, an, irony, since, the, choice, of, which, byte, order, method, to, use, is, technically, trivial, both, are, equally, good, but, actually, still, important, systems, which, do, it, one, way, are, thus, incompatible, with, those, that, do, it, the, other, way, and, so, it, shouldn, t, be, left, to, each, individual, designer, s, choice, resulting, in, a, holy, war, over, a, triviality, it, has, been, pointed, out, that, the, long, and, vicious, war, which, started, after, a, disagreement, about, which, was, the, best, end, to, break, an, egg, is, an, example, of, the, narcissism, of, small, differences, a, term, sigmund, freud,
