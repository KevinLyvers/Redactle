a, choir, k, w, a, r, kwire, also, known, as, a, chorale, or, chorus, is, a, musical, ensemble, of, singers, choral, music, in, turn, is, the, music, written, specifically, for, such, an, ensemble, to, perform, or, in, other, words, is, the, music, performed, by, the, ensemble, choirs, may, perform, music, from, the, classical, music, repertoire, which, spans, from, the, medieval, era, to, the, present, or, popular, music, repertoire, most, choirs, are, led, by, a, conductor, who, leads, the, performances, with, arm, hand, and, facial, gestures, the, term, choir, is, very, often, applied, to, groups, affiliated, with, a, church, whether, or, not, they, actually, occupy, the, quire, whereas, a, chorus, performs, in, theatres, or, concert, halls, but, this, distinction, is, not, rigid, choirs, may, sing, without, instruments, or, accompanied, by, a, piano, accordion, pipe, organ, a, small, ensemble, or, an, orchestra, a, choir, can, be, a, subset, of, an, ensemble, thus, one, speaks, of, the, woodwind, choir, of, an, orchestra, or, different, choirs, of, voices, or, instruments, in, a, polychoral, composition, in, typical, 18th, century, to, 21st, century, oratorios, and, masses, chorus, or, choir, implies, that, there, is, more, than, one, singer, per, part, in, contrast, to, the, quartet, of, soloists, also, featured, in, these, works, choirs, are, often, led, by, a, conductor, or, choirmaster, mistress, or, a, choir, director, most, often, choirs, consist, of, four, sections, intended, to, sing, in, four, part, harmony, but, there, is, no, limit, to, the, number, of, possible, parts, as, long, as, there, is, a, singer, available, to, sing, the, part, thomas, tallis, wrote, a, 40, part, motet, entitled, spem, in, alium, for, eight, choirs, of, five, parts, each, krzysztof, penderecki, s, stabat, mater, is, for, three, choirs, of, 16, voices, each, a, total, of, 48, parts, other, than, four, the, most, common, number, of, parts, are, three, five, six, and, eight, choirs, can, sing, with, or, without, instrumental, accompaniment, singing, without, accompaniment, is, called, a, cappella, singing, although, the, american, choral, directors, association, discourages, this, usage, in, favor, of, unaccompanied, since, a, cappella, denotes, singing, as, in, the, chapel, and, much, unaccompanied, music, today, is, secular, accompanying, instruments, vary, widely, from, only, one, instrument, a, piano, or, pipe, organ, to, a, full, orchestra, of, 70, to, 100, musicians, for, rehearsals, a, piano, or, organ, accompaniment, is, often, used, even, if, a, different, instrumentation, is, planned, for, performance, or, if, the, choir, is, rehearsing, unaccompanied, music, with, the, new, prevalence, of, electronic, devices, small, groups, can, use, these, together, with, learning, tracks, for, both, group, rehearsals, and, private, practice, many, choirs, perform, in, one, or, many, locations, such, as, a, church, opera, house, school, or, village, hall, in, some, cases, choirs, join, up, to, become, one, mass, choir, that, performs, for, a, special, concert, in, this, case, they, provide, a, series, of, songs, or, musical, works, to, celebrate, and, provide, entertainment, to, others, conducting, is, the, art, of, directing, a, musical, performance, such, as, a, choral, concert, by, way, of, visible, gestures, with, the, hands, arms, face, and, head, the, primary, duties, of, the, conductor, or, choirmaster, mistress, are, to, unify, performers, set, the, tempo, execute, clear, preparations, and, beats, meter, and, to, listen, critically, and, shape, the, sound, of, the, ensemble, in, most, choirs, the, same, individual, acts, as, musical, director, responsible, for, deciding, the, repertoire, and, engaging, soloists, and, accompanists, chorus, master, mistress, or, r, p, titeur, responsible, for, training, and, rehearsing, the, singers, and, conductor, responsible, for, directing, the, performance, however, these, roles, may, be, divided, especially, when, the, choir, is, combined, with, other, forces, for, example, in, opera, the, conductor, or, choral, director, typically, stands, on, a, raised, platform, and, he, or, she, may, or, may, not, use, a, baton, using, a, baton, gives, the, conductor, s, gestures, greater, visibility, but, many, choral, conductors, prefer, conducting, with, their, hands, for, greater, expressiveness, particularly, when, working, with, a, smaller, ensemble, in, the, 2010s, most, conductors, do, not, play, an, instrument, when, conducting, although, in, earlier, periods, of, classical, music, history, leading, an, ensemble, while, playing, an, instrument, was, common, in, baroque, music, from, the, 1600s, to, the, 1750s, conductors, performing, in, the, 2010s, may, lead, an, ensemble, while, playing, a, harpsichord, or, the, violin, see, concertmaster, conducting, while, playing, a, piano, may, also, be, done, with, musical, theatre, pit, orchestras, communication, is, typically, non, verbal, during, a, performance, this, is, strictly, the, case, in, art, music, but, in, jazz, big, bands, or, large, pop, ensembles, there, may, be, occasional, spoken, instructions, however, in, rehearsals, the, conductor, will, often, give, verbal, instructions, to, the, ensemble, since, they, generally, also, serve, as, an, artistic, director, who, crafts, the, ensemble, s, interpretation, of, the, music, conductors, act, as, guides, to, the, choirs, they, conduct, they, choose, the, works, to, be, performed, and, study, their, scores, to, which, they, may, make, certain, adjustments, e, g, regarding, tempo, repetitions, of, sections, assignment, of, vocal, solos, and, so, on, work, out, their, interpretation, and, relay, their, vision, to, the, singers, choral, conductors, may, also, have, to, conduct, instrumental, ensembles, such, as, orchestras, if, the, choir, is, singing, a, piece, for, choir, and, orchestra, they, may, also, attend, to, organizational, matters, such, as, scheduling, rehearsals, planning, a, concert, season, hearing, auditions, and, promoting, their, ensemble, in, the, media, historically, the, sung, repertoire, divides, into, sacred, or, religious, music, and, secular, music, while, much, religious, music, has, been, written, with, concert, performance, in, mind, its, origin, lies, in, its, role, within, the, context, of, liturgy, most, eastern, orthodox, christian, churches, some, american, protestant, groups, and, traditional, jewish, synagogues, do, not, accompany, their, songs, with, musical, instruments, in, churches, of, the, western, rite, the, accompanying, instrument, is, usually, the, organ, although, in, colonial, america, the, moravian, church, used, groups, of, strings, and, winds, many, churches, which, use, a, contemporary, worship, format, use, a, small, amplified, band, to, accompany, the, singing, and, roman, catholic, churches, may, use, at, their, discretion, additional, orchestral, accompaniment, in, addition, to, leading, of, singing, in, which, the, congregation, participates, such, as, hymns, and, service, music, some, church, choirs, sing, full, liturgies, including, propers, introit, gradual, communion, antiphons, appropriate, for, the, different, times, of, the, liturgical, year, chief, among, these, are, the, anglican, and, roman, catholic, churches, far, more, common, however, is, the, performance, of, anthems, or, motets, at, designated, times, in, the, service, one, of, the, main, classifications, of, choirs, is, by, gender, and, age, since, these, factors, have, traditionally, been, thought, to, affect, how, a, choir, sounds, and, what, music, it, performs, the, types, are, listed, here, in, approximate, descending, order, of, prevalence, at, the, professional, and, advanced, amateur, or, semi, professional, levels, the, all, female, and, mixed, children, s, choirs, tend, to, be, professionally, less, prevalent, than, the, high, voiced, boys, choirs, the, lower, voiced, men, s, choruses, or, the, full, satb, choirs, this, is, due, to, some, extent, to, lack, of, scholarships, and, other, types, of, funding, and, a, lack, of, professional, opportunities, for, women, such, as, that, of, being, lay, clerks, or, musical, directors, choirs, are, also, categorized, by, the, institutions, in, which, they, operate, some, choirs, are, categorized, by, the, type, of, music, they, perform, such, as, in, the, united, states, middle, schools, and, high, schools, often, offer, choir, as, a, class, or, activity, some, choirs, participate, in, competitions, one, kind, of, choir, popular, in, high, schools, is, show, choir, during, middle, school, and, high, school, students, voices, are, changing, although, girls, experience, voice, change, it, is, much, more, significant, in, boys, a, lot, of, literature, in, music, education, has, been, focused, on, how, male, voice, change, works, and, how, to, help, adolescent, male, singers, research, done, by, john, cooksey, categorizes, male, voice, change, into, five, stages, and, most, middle, school, boys, are, in, the, early, stages, of, change, the, vocal, range, of, male, and, female, students, may, be, limited, while, their, voice, is, changing, and, choir, teachers, must, be, able, to, adapt, which, can, be, a, challenge, to, teaching, this, age, range, nationally, male, students, are, enrolled, in, choir, at, much, lower, numbers, than, their, female, students, the, music, education, field, has, had, a, longtime, interest, in, the, missing, males, in, music, programs, speculation, as, to, why, there, are, not, as, many, boys, in, choir, and, possible, solutions, vary, widely, one, researcher, found, that, boys, who, enjoy, choir, in, middle, school, may, not, always, go, on, to, high, school, choir, because, it, simply, does, not, fit, into, their, schedules, some, research, speculates, that, one, reason, that, boys, participation, in, choir, is, so, low, is, because, the, u, s, does, not, encourage, male, singers, often, schools, will, have, a, women, s, choir, which, helps, the, balance, issues, mixed, choirs, face, by, taking, on, extra, female, singers, however, without, a, men, s, choir, also, this, can, make, the, problem, worse, by, not, giving, boys, as, many, opportunities, to, sing, as, girls, other, researchers, have, noted, that, having, an, ensemble, or, a, workshop, dedicated, to, male, singers, can, help, with, their, confidence, and, singing, abilities, british, cathedral, choirs, are, usually, made, from, pupils, enrolled, in, schools, there, are, various, schools, of, thought, regarding, how, the, various, sections, should, be, arranged, on, stage, it, is, the, conductor, s, decision, on, where, the, different, voice, types, are, placed, in, symphonic, choirs, it, is, common, though, by, no, means, universal, to, order, the, choir, behind, the, orchestra, from, highest, to, lowest, voices, from, left, to, right, corresponding, to, the, typical, string, layout, in, a, cappella, or, piano, accompanied, situations, it, is, not, unusual, for, the, men, to, be, in, the, back, and, the, women, in, front, some, conductors, prefer, to, place, the, basses, behind, the, sopranos, arguing, that, the, outer, voices, need, to, tune, to, each, other, more, experienced, choirs, may, sing, with, the, voices, all, mixed, sometimes, singers, of, the, same, voice, are, grouped, in, pairs, or, threes, proponents, of, this, method, argue, that, it, makes, it, easier, for, each, individual, singer, to, hear, and, tune, to, the, other, parts, but, it, requires, more, independence, from, each, singer, opponents, argue, that, this, method, loses, the, spatial, separation, of, individual, voice, lines, an, otherwise, valuable, feature, for, the, audience, and, that, it, eliminates, sectional, resonance, which, lessens, the, effective, volume, of, the, chorus, for, music, with, double, or, multiple, choirs, usually, the, members, of, each, choir, are, together, sometimes, significantly, separated, especially, in, performances, of, 16th, century, music, such, as, works, in, the, venetian, polychoral, style, some, composers, actually, specify, that, choirs, should, be, separated, such, as, in, benjamin, britten, s, war, requiem, some, composers, use, separated, choirs, to, create, antiphonal, effects, in, which, one, choir, seems, to, answer, the, other, choir, in, a, musical, dialogue, consideration, is, also, given, to, the, spacing, of, the, singers, studies, have, found, that, not, only, the, actual, formation, but, the, amount, of, space, both, laterally, and, circumambiently, affects, the, perception, of, sound, by, choristers, and, auditors, the, origins, of, choral, music, are, found, in, traditional, music, as, singing, in, big, groups, is, extremely, widely, spread, in, traditional, cultures, both, singing, in, one, part, or, in, unison, like, in, ancient, greece, as, well, as, singing, in, parts, or, in, harmony, like, in, contemporary, european, choral, music, the, oldest, unambiguously, choral, repertory, that, survives, is, that, of, ancient, greece, of, which, the, 2nd, century, bc, delphic, hymns, and, the, 2nd, century, ad, hymns, of, mesomedes, are, the, most, complete, the, original, greek, chorus, sang, its, part, in, greek, drama, and, fragments, of, works, by, euripides, orestes, and, sophocles, ajax, are, known, from, papyri, the, seikilos, epitaph, 2c, bc, is, a, complete, song, although, possibly, for, solo, voice, one, of, the, latest, examples, oxyrhynchus, hymn, 3c, is, also, of, interest, as, the, earliest, christian, music, of, the, roman, drama, s, music, a, single, line, of, terence, surfaced, in, the, 18th, century, however, musicologist, thomas, j, mathiesen, comments, that, it, is, no, longer, believed, to, be, authentic, the, earliest, notated, music, of, western, europe, is, gregorian, chant, along, with, a, few, other, types, of, chant, which, were, later, subsumed, or, sometimes, suppressed, by, the, catholic, church, this, tradition, of, unison, choir, singing, lasted, from, sometime, between, the, times, of, st, ambrose, 4th, century, and, gregory, the, great, 6th, century, up, to, the, present, during, the, later, middle, ages, a, new, type, of, singing, involving, multiple, melodic, parts, called, organum, became, predominant, for, certain, functions, but, initially, this, polyphony, was, only, sung, by, soloists, further, developments, of, this, technique, included, clausulae, conductus, and, the, motet, most, notably, the, isorhythmic, motet, which, unlike, the, renaissance, motet, describes, a, composition, with, different, texts, sung, simultaneously, in, different, voices, the, first, evidence, of, polyphony, with, more, than, one, singer, per, part, comes, in, the, old, hall, manuscript, 1420, though, containing, music, from, the, late, 14th, century, in, which, there, are, apparent, divisi, one, part, dividing, into, two, simultaneously, sounding, notes, during, the, renaissance, sacred, choral, music, was, the, principal, type, of, formally, notated, music, in, western, europe, throughout, the, era, hundreds, of, masses, and, motets, as, well, as, various, other, forms, were, composed, for, a, cappella, choir, though, there, is, some, dispute, over, the, role, of, instruments, during, certain, periods, and, in, certain, areas, some, of, the, better, known, composers, of, this, time, include, guillaume, dufay, josquin, des, prez, giovanni, pierluigi, da, palestrina, john, dunstable, and, william, byrd, the, glories, of, renaissance, polyphony, were, choral, sung, by, choirs, of, great, skill, and, distinction, all, over, europe, choral, music, from, this, period, continues, to, be, popular, with, many, choirs, throughout, the, world, today, the, madrigal, a, partsong, conceived, for, amateurs, to, sing, in, a, chamber, setting, originated, at, this, period, although, madrigals, were, initially, dramatic, settings, of, unrequited, love, poetry, or, mythological, stories, in, italy, they, were, imported, into, england, and, merged, with, the, more, dancelike, balletto, celebrating, carefree, songs, of, the, seasons, or, eating, and, drinking, to, most, english, speakers, the, word, madrigal, now, refers, to, the, latter, rather, than, to, madrigals, proper, which, refers, to, a, poetic, form, of, lines, consisting, of, seven, and, eleven, syllables, each, the, interaction, of, sung, voices, in, renaissance, polyphony, influenced, western, music, for, centuries, composers, are, routinely, trained, in, the, palestrina, style, to, this, day, especially, as, codified, by, the, 18th, century, music, theorist, johann, joseph, fux, composers, of, the, early, 20th, century, also, wrote, in, renaissance, inspired, styles, herbert, howells, wrote, a, mass, in, the, dorian, mode, entirely, in, strict, renaissance, style, and, ralph, vaughan, williams, s, mass, in, g, minor, is, an, extension, of, this, style, anton, webern, wrote, his, dissertation, on, the, choralis, constantinus, of, heinrich, isaac, and, the, contrapuntal, techniques, of, his, serial, music, may, be, informed, by, this, study, the, baroque, period, in, music, is, associated, with, the, development, around, 1600, of, the, figured, bass, and, the, basso, continuo, system, the, figured, bass, part, was, performed, by, the, basso, continuo, group, which, at, minimum, included, a, chord, playing, instrument, e, g, pipe, organ, harpsichord, lute, and, a, bass, instrument, e, g, violone, baroque, vocal, music, explored, dramatic, implications, in, the, realm, of, solo, vocal, music, such, as, the, monodies, of, the, florentine, camerata, and, the, development, of, early, opera, this, innovation, was, in, fact, an, extension, of, established, practice, of, accompanying, choral, music, at, the, organ, either, from, a, skeletal, reduced, score, from, which, otherwise, lost, pieces, can, sometimes, be, reconstructed, or, from, a, basso, seguente, a, part, on, a, single, staff, containing, the, lowest, sounding, part, the, bass, part, a, new, genre, was, the, vocal, concertato, combining, voices, and, instruments, its, origins, may, be, sought, in, the, polychoral, music, of, the, venetian, school, claudio, monteverdi, 1567, 1643, brought, it, to, perfection, with, his, vespers, and, his, eighth, book, of, madrigals, which, call, for, great, virtuosity, on, the, part, of, singers, and, instruments, alike, his, fifth, book, includes, a, basso, continuo, for, harpsichord, or, lute, his, pupil, heinrich, sch, tz, 1585, 1672, who, had, earlier, studied, with, giovanni, gabrieli, introduced, the, new, style, to, germany, alongside, the, new, music, of, the, seconda, pratica, contrapuntal, motets, in, the, stile, antico, or, old, style, continued, to, be, written, well, into, the, 19th, century, choirs, at, this, time, were, usually, quite, small, and, that, singers, could, be, classified, as, suited, to, church, or, to, chamber, singing, monteverdi, himself, a, singer, is, documented, as, taking, part, in, performances, of, his, magnificat, with, one, voice, per, part, independent, instrumental, accompaniment, opened, up, new, possibilities, for, choral, music, verse, anthems, alternated, accompanied, solos, with, choral, sections, the, best, known, composers, of, this, genre, were, orlando, gibbons, and, henry, purcell, grands, motets, such, as, those, of, lully, and, delalande, separated, these, sections, into, separate, movements, oratorios, of, which, giacomo, carissimi, was, a, pioneer, extended, this, concept, into, concert, length, works, usually, based, on, biblical, or, moral, stories, a, pinnacle, of, baroque, choral, music, particularly, oratorio, may, be, found, in, george, frideric, handel, s, works, notably, messiah, and, israel, in, egypt, while, the, modern, chorus, of, hundreds, had, to, await, the, growth, of, choral, societies, and, his, centennial, commemoration, concert, we, find, handel, already, using, a, variety, of, performing, forces, from, the, soloists, of, the, chandos, anthems, to, larger, groups, whose, proportions, are, still, quite, different, from, modern, orchestra, choruses, yesterday, there, was, a, rehearsal, of, the, coronation, anthem, in, westminster, abby, set, to, musick, by, the, famous, mr, hendall, there, being, 40, voices, and, about, 160, violins, trumpets, hautboys, kettle, drums, and, bass, proportionable, lutheran, composers, wrote, instrumentally, accompanied, cantatas, often, based, on, chorale, tunes, substantial, late, 17th, century, sacred, choral, works, in, the, emerging, german, tradition, exist, the, cantatas, of, dietrich, buxtehude, being, a, prime, example, though, the, lutheran, church, cantata, did, not, assume, its, more, codified, recognizable, form, until, the, early, 18th, century, georg, philipp, telemann, based, in, frankfurt, wrote, over, 1000, cantatas, many, of, which, were, engraved, and, published, e, g, his, harmonische, gottesdienst, and, christoph, graupner, based, in, darmstadt, over, 1400, the, cantatas, of, johann, sebastian, bach, 1685, 1750, are, perhaps, the, most, recognizable, and, often, performed, contribution, to, this, repertoire, his, obituary, mentions, five, complete, cycles, of, his, cantatas, of, which, three, comprising, some, 200, works, are, known, today, in, addition, to, motets, bach, himself, rarely, used, the, term, cantata, motet, refers, to, his, church, music, without, orchestra, accompaniment, but, instruments, playing, colla, parte, with, the, voices, his, works, with, accompaniment, consists, of, his, passions, masses, the, magnificat, and, the, cantatas, a, point, of, hot, controversy, today, is, the, so, called, rifkin, hypothesis, which, re, examines, the, famous, entwurff, bach, s, 1730, memo, to, the, leipzig, city, council, a, short, but, most, necessary, draft, for, a, well, appointed, church, music, calling, for, at, least, 12, singers, in, light, of, bach, s, responsibility, to, provide, music, to, four, churches, and, be, able, to, perform, double, choir, compositions, with, a, substitute, for, each, voice, joshua, rifkin, concludes, that, bach, s, music, was, normally, written, with, one, voice, per, part, in, mind, a, few, sets, of, original, performing, parts, include, ripieni, who, reinforce, rather, than, slavishly, double, the, vocal, quartet, composers, of, the, late, 18th, century, became, fascinated, with, the, new, possibilities, of, the, symphony, and, other, instrumental, music, and, generally, neglected, choral, music, mozart, s, mostly, sacred, choral, works, stand, out, as, some, of, his, greatest, such, as, the, great, mass, in, c, minor, and, requiem, in, d, minor, the, latter, of, which, is, highly, regarded, haydn, became, more, interested, in, choral, music, near, the, end, of, his, life, following, his, visits, to, england, in, the, 1790s, when, he, heard, various, handel, oratorios, performed, by, large, forces, he, wrote, a, series, of, masses, beginning, in, 1797, and, his, two, great, oratorios, the, creation, and, the, seasons, beethoven, wrote, only, two, masses, both, intended, for, liturgical, use, although, his, missa, solemnis, is, probably, suitable, only, for, the, grandest, ceremonies, due, to, its, length, difficulty, and, large, scale, scoring, he, also, pioneered, the, use, of, chorus, as, part, of, symphonic, texture, with, his, ninth, symphony, and, choral, fantasia, in, the, 19th, century, sacred, music, escaped, from, the, church, and, leaped, onto, the, concert, stage, with, large, sacred, works, unsuitable, for, church, use, such, as, berlioz, s, te, deum, and, requiem, and, brahms, s, ein, deutsches, requiem, rossini, s, stabat, mater, schubert, s, masses, and, verdi, s, requiem, also, exploited, the, grandeur, offered, by, instrumental, accompaniment, oratorios, also, continued, to, be, written, clearly, influenced, by, handel, s, models, berlioz, s, l, enfance, du, christ, and, mendelssohn, s, elijah, and, st, paul, are, in, the, category, schubert, mendelssohn, and, brahms, also, wrote, secular, cantatas, the, best, known, of, which, are, brahms, s, schicksalslied, and, n, nie, a, few, composers, developed, a, cappella, music, especially, bruckner, whose, masses, and, motets, startlingly, juxtapose, renaissance, counterpoint, with, chromatic, harmony, mendelssohn, and, brahms, also, wrote, significant, a, cappella, motets, the, amateur, chorus, beginning, chiefly, as, a, social, outlet, began, to, receive, serious, consideration, as, a, compositional, venue, for, the, part, songs, of, schubert, schumann, mendelssohn, brahms, and, others, these, singing, clubs, were, often, for, women, or, men, separately, and, the, music, was, typically, in, four, part, hence, the, name, part, song, and, either, a, cappella, or, with, simple, instrumentation, at, the, same, time, the, cecilian, movement, attempted, a, restoration, of, the, pure, renaissance, style, in, catholic, churches, in, the, united, states, development, of, mixed, choirs, was, pioneered, by, groups, such, as, the, st, olaf, choir, and, westminster, choir, college, these, groups, were, characterized, by, arrangements, of, hymns, and, other, sacred, works, of, christian, nature, which, helped, define, the, choral, sound, of, the, united, states, for, most, of, the, 20th, century, secular, choral, music, in, the, united, states, was, popularized, by, groups, such, as, the, dale, warland, singers, throughout, the, late, 20th, century, the, big, choral, census, online, survey, was, established, to, find, out, how, many, choirs, there, were, in, the, uk, of, what, type, with, how, many, members, singing, what, type, of, music, and, with, what, sort, of, funding, results, estimated, that, there, were, some, 40, 000, choral, groups, operating, in, the, uk, and, over, 2, million, people,
