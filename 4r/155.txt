in, his, studies, on, a, dream, of, the, red, chamber, 1921, argued, that, these, chapters, were, written, by, gao, e, citing, the, foreshadowing, of, the, main, characters, fates, in, chapter, 5, which, differs, from, the, ending, of, the, 1791, cheng, gao, version, however, during, the, mid, 20th, century, the, discovery, of, a, 120, chapter, manuscript, that, dates, well, before, 1791, further, complicated, the, questions, regarding, gao, e, and, cheng, weiyuan, s, involvement, whether, they, simply, edited, cao, xueqin, s, work, or, actually, wrote, the, continuation, of, the, novel, though, it, is, unclear, if, the, last, 40, chapters, of, the, discovered, manuscript, contained, the, original, works, of, cao, irene, eber, found, the, discovery, seems, to, confirm, cheng, and, gao, s, claim, that, they, merely, edited, a, complete, manuscript, consisting, of, 120, chapters, rather, than, actually, writing, a, portion, of, the, novel, the, book, is, usually, published, and, read, in, cheng, weiyuan, and, gao, e, s, 120, chapter, version, some, modern, editions, such, as, zhou, ruchang, s, do, not, include, the, last, 40, chapters, in, 2014, three, researchers, using, data, analysis, of, writing, styles, announced, that, applying, our, method, to, the, cheng, gao, version, of, dream, of, the, red, chamber, has, led, to, convincing, if, not, irrefutable, evidence, that, the, first, 80, chapters, and, the, last, 40, chapters, of, the, book, were, written, by, two, different, authors, in, 2020, zhang, qingshan, the, president, of, the, academic, organization, society, of, the, dream, of, the, red, chamber, stated, that, although, the, authorship, of, the, novel, s, last, 40, chapters, remains, uncertain, it, is, unlikely, gao, e, was, the, one, who, wrote, them, in, the, novel, s, frame, story, a, sentient, stone, left, over, when, the, goddess, n, wa, mended, the, heaven, aeons, ago, wants, to, enjoy, the, pleasures, of, the, red,

19th, century, hong, lou, meng, s, influence, was, so, pervasive, that, the, reformer, liang, qichao, attacked, it, along, with, another, classic, novel, water, margin, as, incitement, to, robbery, and, lust, and, for, smothering, the, introduction, of, western, style, novels, which, he, regarded, as, more, socially, responsible, the, eminent, scholar, wang, guowei, however, achieved, a, new, method, of, literary, interpretation, in, an, innovative, and, path, breaking, 1904, essay, which, invoked, the, philosophy, of, arthur, schopenhauer, wang, called, the, novel, the, tragedy, of, tragedies, in, contrast, to, the, prosperous, endings, in, most, earlier, drama, and, fiction, wang, further, proclaims, the, novel, as, worthy, of, being, considered, as, the, one, great, masterpiece, in, the, realm, of, chinese, art, in, the, early, 20th, century, although, the, new, culture, movement, took, a, critical, view, of, the, confucian, classics, the, scholar, hu, shih, used, the, tools, of, textual, criticism, to, put, the, novel, in, an, entirely, different, light, as, a, foundation, for, national, culture, hu, and, his, students, gu, jiegang, and, yu, pingbo, first, established, that, cao, xueqin, was, the, work, s, author, taking, the, question, of, authorship, seriously, reflected, a, new, respect, for, fiction, since, the, lesser, forms, of, literature,

reading, texts, the, final, and, in, some, respects, most, important, task, was, to, study, the, vocabulary, and, usage, of, cao, s, beijing, dialect, as, a, basis, for, modern, mandarin, in, the, 1920s, scholars, and, devoted, readers, developed, hongxue, or, redology, into, both, a, scholarly, field, and, a, popular, avocation, among, the, avid, readers, was, the, young, mao, zedong, who, later, claimed, to, have, read, the, novel, five, times, and, praised, it, as, one, of, china, s, greatest, works, of, literature, the, influence, of, the, novel, s, themes, and, style, are, evident, in, many, modern, chinese, prose, works, the, early, 1950s, was, a, rich, period, for, redology, with, publication, of, major, studies, by, yu, pingbo, zhou, ruchang, who, as, a, young, scholar, had, come, to, the, attention, of, hu, shih, in, the, late, 1940s, published, his, first, study, in, 1953, which, became, a, best, seller, but, in, 1954, mao, personally, criticized, yu, pingbo, for, his, bourgeois, idealism, in, failing, to, emphasize, that, the, novel, exposed, the, decadence, of, feudal, society, and, the, theme, of, class, struggle, in, the, hundred, flowers, campaign, yu, came, under, heavy, criticism, but, the, attacks, were, so, extensive, and, full, of, quotations, from, his, work, that, they, spread, yu, s, ideas, to, many, people, who, would, not, otherwise, have, known, of, their, existence, during, the, cultural, revolution, the, novel, initially, came, under, fire, though, it, quickly, regained, its, prestige, in, the, following, years, zhou, ruchang, resumed, his, lifework, eventually, publishing, more, than, sixty, biographical, and, critical, studies, in, 2006, zhou, who, had, long, distrusted, gao, e, s, editions, and, the, novelist, liu, xinwu, author, of, popular, studies, of, the, novel, joined, to, produce, a, new, 80, chapter, version, which, zhou, had, edited, to, eliminate, the, cheng, gao, emendations, liu, completed, an, ending, that, was, supposedly, more, true, to, cao, s, original, intent, the, novel, continues, to, be, influential, on, contemporary, chinese, poets, such, as, middle, generation, s, an, qi, who, paid, homage, to, it, in, her, poem, to, cao, xueqin, one, of, the, great, monuments, of, the, world, s, literature, cao, utilizes, many, levels, of, colloquial, and, literary, language, and, incorporates, forms, of, classic, poetry, that, are, integral, to, the, novel, making, it, a, major, challenge, to, translate, a, 2014, study, of, fourteen, translations, of, the, novel, concluded, that, the, work, is, a, challenge, even, to, the, most, resourceful, of, translators, and, the, process, of, rendering, it, into, another, language, is, bound, to, involve, more, translation, problems, techniques, and, principles, than, the, process, of, rendering, any, other, literary, work, accordingly, the, aims, and, achievements, of, the, translators, differ, widely, the, first, recorded, translation, into, english, was, in, 1812, by, the, protestant, missionary, and, sinologist, robert, morrison, 1782, 1834, who, translated, part, of, chapter, four, for, the, second, volume,

saying, that, chinese, read, it, because, of, its, wickedness, herbert, giles, whom, john, minford, called, one, of, the, more, free, thinking, british, consular, officers, took, a, more, favorable,

review, of, wang, s, translation, harry, clemons, of, the, virginia, quarterly, review, wrote, this, is, a, great, novel, and, along, with, the, romance, of, the, three, kingdoms, it, ranks, foremost, among, the, novels, of, classic, chinese, literature, although, clemons, felt, meaning, was, only, fragmentarily, revealed, in, the, english, translated, prose, and, that, many, of, the, incidents, and, much, of, the, poetry, were, omitted, he, nevertheless, thought, at, any, rate, the, effort, to, read, the, dream, of, the, red, chamber, is, eminently, worth, making, in, 1958, wang, published,

versions, that, are, accurate, ingenious, and, delightful, hawkes, recreates, the, meanings, and, sounds, of, the, original, with, remarkable, precision, achieving, much, greater, success, than, any, one, of, his, fellow, translators, in, surmounting, the, limits, of, literary, translation, another, scholar, agreed, that, the, yang, s, translation, is, literal, in, the, sense, of, rendering, word,

to, simply, translate, certain, names, that, are, puns, makes, the, author, s, intentions, clearer, and, that, the, yangs, choice, of, transliteration, leaves, the, meaning, more, elusive, even, if,
