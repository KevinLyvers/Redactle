a, ballad, is, a, form, of, verse, often, a, narrative, set, to, music, ballads, derive, from, the, medieval, french, chanson, ballad, e, or, ballade, which, were, originally, dance, songs, ballads, were, particularly, characteristic, of, the, popular, poetry, and, song, of, great, britain, and, ireland, from, the, late, middle, ages, until, the, 19th, century, they, were, widely, used, across, europe, and, later, in, australia, north, africa, north, america, and, south, america, while, ballads, have, no, prescribed, structure, and, may, vary, in, their, number, of, lines, and, stanzas, many, ballads, employ, quatrains, with, abcb, or, abab, rhyme, schemes, the, key, being, a, rhymed, second, and, fourth, line, contrary, to, a, popular, conception, it, is, rare, if, not, unheard, of, for, a, ballad, to, contain, exactly, 13, lines, additionally, couplets, rarely, appear, in, ballads, many, ballads, were, written, and, sold, as, single, sheet, broadsides, the, form, was, often, used, by, poets, and, composers, from, the, 18th, century, onwards, to, produce, lyrical, ballads, in, the, later, 19th, century, the, term, took, on, the, meaning, of, a, slow, form, of, popular, love, song, and, is, often, used, for, any, love, song, particularly, the, sentimental, ballad, of, pop, or, rock, music, although, the, term, is, also, associated, with, the, concept, of, a, stylized, storytelling, song, or, poem, particularly, when, used, as, a, title, for, other, media, such, as, a, film, a, ballad, is, a, form, of, verse, often, a, narrative, set, to, music, ballads, derive, from, the, medieval, french, chanson, ballad, e, or, ballade, which, were, originally, dancing, songs, l, ballare, to, dance, yet, becoming, stylized, forms, of, solo, song, before, being, adopted, in, england, as, a, narrative, song, their, theme, and, function, may, originate, from, scandinavian, and, germanic, traditions, of, storytelling, that, can, be, seen, in, poems, such, as, beowulf, musically, they, were, influenced, by, the, minnelieder, of, the, minnesang, tradition, the, earliest, example, of, a, recognizable, ballad, in, form, in, england, is, judas, in, a, 13th, century, manuscript, ballads, were, originally, written, to, accompany, dances, and, so, were, composed, in, couplets, with, refrains, in, alternate, lines, these, refrains, would, have, been, sung, by, the, dancers, in, time, with, the, dance, most, northern, and, west, european, ballads, are, written, in, ballad, stanzas, or, quatrains, four, line, stanzas, of, alternating, lines, of, iambic, an, unstressed, followed, by, a, stressed, syllable, tetrameter, eight, syllables, and, iambic, trimeter, six, syllables, known, as, ballad, meter, usually, only, the, second, and, fourth, line, of, a, quatrain, are, rhymed, in, the, scheme, a, b, c, b, which, has, been, taken, to, suggest, that, originally, ballads, consisted, of, couplets, two, lines, of, rhymed, verse, each, of, 14, syllables, this, can, be, seen, in, this, stanza, from, lord, thomas, and, fair, annet, the, horse, fair, ann, et, rode, up, on, he, amb, led, like, the, wind, with, sil, ver, he, was, shod, be, fore, with, burn, ing, gold, be, hind, there, is, considerable, variation, on, this, pattern, in, almost, every, respect, including, length, number, of, lines, and, rhyming, scheme, making, the, strict, definition, of, a, ballad, extremely, difficult, in, southern, and, eastern, europe, and, in, countries, that, derive, their, tradition, from, them, ballad, structure, differs, significantly, like, spanish, romanceros, which, are, octosyllabic, and, use, consonance, rather, than, rhyme, ballads, usually, are, heavily, influenced, by, the, regions, in, which, they, originate, and, use, the, common, dialect, of, the, people, scotland, s, ballads, in, particular, both, in, theme, and, language, are, strongly, characterised, by, their, distinctive, tradition, even, exhibiting, some, pre, christian, influences, in, the, inclusion, of, supernatural, elements, such, as, travel, to, the, fairy, kingdom, in, the, scots, ballad, tam, lin, the, ballads, do, not, have, any, known, author, or, correct, version, instead, having, been, passed, down, mainly, by, oral, tradition, since, the, middle, ages, there, are, many, variations, of, each, the, ballads, remained, an, oral, tradition, until, the, increased, interest, in, folk, songs, in, the, 18th, century, led, collectors, such, as, bishop, thomas, percy, 1729, 1811, to, publish, volumes, of, popular, ballads, in, all, traditions, most, ballads, are, narrative, in, nature, with, a, self, contained, story, often, concise, and, rely, on, imagery, rather, than, description, which, can, be, tragic, historical, romantic, or, comic, themes, concerning, rural, labourers, and, their, sexuality, are, common, and, there, are, many, ballads, based, on, the, robin, hood, legend, another, common, feature, of, ballads, is, repetition, sometimes, of, fourth, lines, in, succeeding, stanzas, as, a, refrain, sometimes, of, third, and, fourth, lines, of, a, stanza, and, sometimes, of, entire, stanzas, scholars, of, ballads, have, been, divided, into, communalists, such, as, johann, gottfried, herder, 1744, 1803, and, the, brothers, grimm, who, argue, that, ballads, are, originally, communal, compositions, and, individualists, such, as, cecil, sharp, who, assert, that, there, was, one, single, original, author, communalists, tend, to, see, more, recent, particularly, printed, broadside, ballads, of, known, authorship, as, a, debased, form, of, the, genre, while, individualists, see, variants, as, corruptions, of, an, original, text, more, recently, scholars, have, pointed, to, the, interchange, of, oral, and, written, forms, of, the, ballad, the, transmission, of, ballads, comprises, a, key, stage, in, their, re, composition, in, romantic, terms, this, process, is, often, dramatized, as, a, narrative, of, degeneration, away, from, the, pure, folk, memory, or, immemorial, tradition, in, the, introduction, to, minstrelsy, of, the, scottish, border, 1802, the, romantic, poet, and, historical, novelist, walter, scott, argued, a, need, to, remove, obvious, corruptions, in, order, to, attempt, to, restore, a, supposed, original, for, scott, the, process, of, multiple, recitations, incurs, the, risk, of, impertinent, interpolations, from, the, conceit, of, one, rehearser, unintelligible, blunders, from, the, stupidity, of, another, and, omissions, equally, to, be, regretted, from, the, want, of, memory, of, a, third, similarly, john, robert, moore, noted, a, natural, tendency, to, oblivescence, european, ballads, have, been, generally, classified, into, three, major, groups, traditional, broadside, and, literary, in, america, a, distinction, is, drawn, between, ballads, that, are, versions, of, european, particularly, british, and, irish, songs, and, native, american, ballads, developed, without, reference, to, earlier, songs, a, further, development, was, the, evolution, of, the, blues, ballad, which, mixed, the, genre, with, afro, american, music, for, the, late, 20th, century, the, music, publishing, industry, found, a, market, for, what, are, often, termed, sentimental, ballads, and, these, are, the, origin, of, the, modern, use, of, the, term, ballad, to, mean, a, slow, love, song, the, traditional, classical, or, popular, meaning, of, the, people, ballad, has, been, seen, as, beginning, with, the, wandering, minstrels, of, late, medieval, europe, from, the, end, of, the, 15th, century, there, are, printed, ballads, that, suggest, a, rich, tradition, of, popular, music, a, reference, in, william, langland, s, piers, plowman, indicates, that, ballads, about, robin, hood, were, being, sung, from, at, least, the, late, 14th, century, and, the, oldest, detailed, material, is, wynkyn, de, worde, s, collection, of, robin, hood, ballads, printed, about, 1495, early, collections, of, english, ballads, were, made, by, samuel, pepys, 1633, 1703, and, in, the, roxburghe, ballads, collected, by, robert, harley, 1661, 1724, which, paralleled, the, work, in, scotland, by, walter, scott, and, robert, burns, inspired, by, his, reading, as, a, teenager, of, reliques, of, ancient, english, poetry, by, thomas, percy, scott, began, collecting, ballads, while, he, attended, edinburgh, university, in, the, 1790s, he, published, his, research, from, 1802, to, 1803, in, a, three, volume, work, minstrelsy, of, the, scottish, border, burns, collaborated, with, james, johnson, on, the, multi, volume, scots, musical, museum, a, miscellany, of, folk, songs, and, poetry, with, original, work, by, burns, around, the, same, time, he, worked, with, george, thompson, on, a, select, collection, of, original, scottish, airs, for, the, voice, both, northern, english, and, southern, scots, shared, in, the, identified, tradition, of, border, ballads, particularly, evinced, by, the, cross, border, narrative, in, versions, of, the, ballad, of, chevy, chase, sometimes, associated, with, the, lancashire, born, sixteenth, century, minstrel, richard, sheale, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, increasing, interest, in, traditional, popular, ballads, during, the, eighteenth, century, was, prompted, by, social, issues, such, as, the, enclosure, movement, as, many, of, the, ballads, deal, with, themes, concerning, rural, laborers, james, davey, has, suggested, that, the, common, themes, of, sailing, and, naval, battles, may, also, have, prompted, the, use, at, least, in, england, of, popular, ballads, as, naval, recruitment, tools, key, work, on, the, traditional, ballad, was, undertaken, in, the, late, 19th, century, in, denmark, by, svend, grundtvig, and, for, england, and, scotland, by, the, harvard, professor, francis, james, child, they, attempted, to, record, and, classify, all, the, known, ballads, and, variants, in, their, chosen, regions, since, child, died, before, writing, a, commentary, on, his, work, it, is, uncertain, exactly, how, and, why, he, differentiated, the, 305, ballads, printed, that, would, be, published, as, the, english, and, scottish, popular, ballads, there, have, been, many, different, and, contradictory, attempts, to, classify, traditional, ballads, by, theme, but, commonly, identified, types, are, the, religious, supernatural, tragic, love, ballads, historic, legendary, and, humorous, the, traditional, form, and, content, of, the, ballad, were, modified, to, form, the, basis, for, twenty, three, bawdy, pornographic, ballads, that, appeared, in, the, underground, victorian, magazine, the, pearl, which, ran, for, eighteen, issues, between, 1879, and, 1880, unlike, the, traditional, ballad, these, obscene, ballads, aggressively, mocked, sentimental, nostalgia, and, local, lore, broadside, ballads, also, known, as, broadsheet, stall, vulgar, or, come, all, ye, ballads, were, a, product, of, the, development, of, cheap, print, in, the, 16th, century, they, were, generally, printed, on, one, side, of, a, medium, to, large, sheet, of, poor, quality, paper, in, the, first, half, of, the, 17th, century, they, were, printed, in, black, letter, or, gothic, type, and, included, multiple, eye, catching, illustrations, a, popular, tune, title, as, well, as, an, alluring, poem, by, the, 18th, century, they, were, printed, in, white, letter, or, roman, type, and, often, without, much, decoration, as, well, as, tune, title, these, later, sheets, could, include, many, individual, songs, which, would, be, cut, apart, and, sold, individually, as, slip, songs, alternatively, they, might, be, folded, to, make, small, cheap, books, or, chapbooks, which, often, drew, on, ballad, stories, they, were, produced, in, huge, numbers, with, over, 400, 000, being, sold, in, england, annually, by, the, 1660s, tessa, watt, estimates, the, number, of, copies, sold, may, have, been, in, the, millions, many, were, sold, by, travelling, chapmen, in, city, streets, or, at, fairs, the, subject, matter, varied, from, what, has, been, defined, as, the, traditional, ballad, although, many, traditional, ballads, were, printed, as, broadsides, among, the, topics, were, love, marriage, religion, drinking, songs, legends, and, early, journalism, which, included, disasters, political, events, and, signs, wonders, and, prodigies, literary, or, lyrical, ballads, grew, out, of, an, increasing, interest, in, the, ballad, form, among, social, elites, and, intellectuals, particularly, in, the, romantic, movement, from, the, later, 18th, century, respected, literary, figures, robert, burns, and, walter, scott, in, scotland, collected, and, wrote, their, own, ballads, similarly, in, england, william, wordsworth, and, samuel, taylor, coleridge, produced, a, collection, of, lyrical, ballads, in, 1798, that, included, coleridge, s, the, rime, of, the, ancient, mariner, wordsworth, coleridge, and, keats, were, attracted, to, the, simple, and, natural, style, of, these, folk, ballads, and, tried, to, imitate, it, at, the, same, time, in, germany, goethe, cooperated, with, schiller, on, a, series, of, ballads, some, of, which, were, later, set, to, music, by, schubert, later, important, examples, of, the, poetic, form, included, rudyard, kipling, s, barrack, room, ballads, 1892, 6, and, oscar, wilde, s, the, ballad, of, reading, gaol, 1897, in, the, 18th, century, ballad, operas, developed, as, a, form, of, english, stage, entertainment, partly, in, opposition, to, the, italian, domination, of, the, london, operatic, scene, it, consisted, of, racy, and, often, satirical, spoken, english, dialogue, interspersed, with, songs, that, are, deliberately, kept, very, short, to, minimize, disruptions, to, the, flow, of, the, story, rather, than, the, more, aristocratic, themes, and, music, of, the, italian, opera, the, ballad, operas, were, set, to, the, music, of, popular, folk, songs, and, dealt, with, lower, class, characters, subject, matter, involved, the, lower, often, criminal, orders, and, typically, showed, a, suspension, or, inversion, of, the, high, moral, values, of, the, italian, opera, of, the, period, the, first, most, important, and, successful, was, the, beggar, s, opera, of, 1728, with, a, libretto, by, john, gay, and, music, arranged, by, john, christopher, pepusch, both, of, whom, probably, influenced, by, parisian, vaudeville, and, the, burlesques, and, musical, plays, of, thomas, d, urfey, 1653, 1723, a, number, of, whose, collected, ballads, they, used, in, their, work, gay, produced, further, works, in, this, style, including, a, sequel, under, the, title, polly, henry, fielding, colley, cibber, arne, dibdin, arnold, shield, jackson, of, exeter, hook, and, many, others, produced, ballad, operas, that, enjoyed, great, popularity, ballad, opera, was, attempted, in, america, and, prussia, later, it, moved, into, a, more, pastoral, form, like, isaac, bickerstaffe, s, love, in, a, village, 1763, and, shield, s, rosina, 1781, using, more, original, music, that, imitated, rather, than, reproduced, existing, ballads, although, the, form, declined, in, popularity, towards, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, its, influence, can, be, seen, in, light, operas, like, that, of, gilbert, and, sullivan, s, early, works, like, the, sorcerer, as, well, as, in, the, modern, musical, in, the, 20th, century, one, of, the, most, influential, plays, kurt, weill, and, bertolt, brecht, s, 1928, the, threepenny, opera, was, a, reworking, of, the, beggar, s, opera, setting, a, similar, story, with, the, same, characters, and, containing, much, of, the, same, satirical, bite, but, only, using, one, tune, from, the, original, the, term, ballad, opera, has, also, been, used, to, describe, musicals, using, folk, music, such, as, the, martins, and, the, coys, in, 1944, and, peter, bellamy, s, the, transports, in, 1977, the, satiric, elements, of, ballad, opera, can, be, seen, in, some, modern, musicals, such, as, chicago, and, cabaret, some, 300, ballads, sung, in, north, america, have, been, identified, as, having, origins, in, scottish, traditional, or, broadside, ballads, examples, include, the, streets, of, laredo, which, was, found, in, great, britain, and, ireland, as, the, unfortunate, rake, however, a, further, 400, have, been, identified, as, originating, in, america, including, among, the, best, known, the, ballad, of, davy, crockett, and, jesse, james, they, became, an, increasing, area, of, interest, for, scholars, in, the, 19th, century, and, most, were, recorded, or, catalogued, by, george, malcolm, laws, although, some, have, since, been, found, to, have, british, origins, and, additional, songs, have, since, been, collected, they, are, usually, considered, closest, in, form, to, british, broadside, ballads, and, in, terms, of, style, are, largely, indistinguishable, however, they, demonstrate, a, particular, concern, with, occupations, journalistic, style, and, often, lack, the, ribaldry, of, british, broadside, ballads, the, blues, ballad, has, been, seen, as, a, fusion, of, anglo, american, and, afro, american, styles, of, music, from, the, 19th, century, blues, ballads, tend, to, deal, with, active, protagonists, often, anti, heroes, resisting, adversity, and, authority, but, frequently, lacking, a, strong, narrative, and, emphasising, character, instead, they, were, often, accompanied, by, banjo, and, guitar, which, followed, the, blues, musical, format, the, most, famous, blues, ballads, include, those, about, john, henry, and, casey, jones, the, ballad, was, taken, to, australia, by, early, settlers, from, great, britain, and, ireland, and, gained, particular, foothold, in, the, rural, outback, the, rhyming, songs, poems, and, tales, written, in, the, form, of, ballads, often, relate, to, the, itinerant, and, rebellious, spirit, of, australia, in, the, bush, and, the, authors, and, performers, are, often, referred, to, as, bush, bards, the, 19th, century, was, the, golden, age, of, bush, ballads, several, collectors, have, catalogued, the, songs, including, john, meredith, whose, recording, in, the, 1950s, became, the, basis, of, the, collection, in, the, national, library, of, australia, the, songs, tell, personal, stories, of, life, in, the, wide, open, country, of, australia, typical, subjects, include, mining, raising, and, droving, cattle, sheep, shearing, wanderings, war, stories, the, 1891, australian, shearers, strike, class, conflicts, between, the, landless, working, class, and, the, squatters, landowners, and, outlaws, such, as, ned, kelly, as, well, as, love, interests, and, more, modern, fare, such, as, trucking, the, most, famous, bush, ballad, is, waltzing, matilda, which, has, been, called, the, unofficial, national, anthem, of, australia, sentimental, ballads, sometimes, called, tear, jerkers, or, drawing, room, ballads, owing, to, their, popularity, with, the, middle, classes, had, their, origins, in, the, early, tin, pan, alley, music, industry, of, the, later, 19th, century, they, were, generally, sentimental, narrative, strophic, songs, published, separately, or, as, part, of, an, opera, descendants, perhaps, of, broadside, ballads, but, with, printed, music, and, usually, newly, composed, such, songs, include, little, rosewood, casket, 1870, after, the, ball, 1892, and, danny, boy, the, association, with, sentimentality, led, to, the, term, ballad, being, used, for, slow, love, songs, from, the, 1950s, onwards, modern, variations, include, jazz, ballads, pop, ballads, rock, ballads, r, b, ballads, and, power, ballads
