sacral, architecture, also, known, as, sacred, architecture, or, religious, architecture, is, a, religious, architectural, practice, concerned, with, the, design, and, construction, of, places, of, worship, or, sacred, or, intentional, space, such, as, churches, mosques, stupas, synagogues, and, temples, many, cultures, devoted, considerable, resources, to, their, sacred, architecture, and, places, of, worship, religious, and, sacred, spaces, are, amongst, the, most, impressive, and, permanent, monolithic, buildings, created, by, humanity, conversely, sacred, architecture, as, a, locale, for, meta, intimacy, may, also, be, non, monolithic, ephemeral, and, intensely, private, personal, and, non, public, sacred, religious, and, holy, structures, often, evolved, over, centuries, and, were, the, largest, buildings, in, the, world, prior, to, the, modern, skyscraper, while, the, various, styles, employed, in, sacred, architecture, sometimes, reflected, trends, in, other, structures, these, styles, also, remained, unique, from, the, contemporary, architecture, used, in, other, structures, with, the, rise, of, christianity, and, islam, religious, buildings, increasingly, became, centres, of, worship, prayer, and, meditation, the, western, scholarly, discipline, of, the, history, of, architecture, itself, closely, follows, the, history, of, religious, architecture, from, ancient, times, until, the, baroque, period, at, least, sacred, geometry, iconography, and, the, use, of, sophisticated, semiotics, such, as, signs, symbols, and, religious, motifs, are, endemic, to, sacred, architecture, sacred, or, religious, architecture, is, sometimes, called, sacred, space, architect, norman, l, koonce, has, suggested, that, the, goal, of, sacred, architecture, is, to, make, transparent, the, boundary, between, matter, and, mind, flesh, and, the, spirit, in, discussing, sacred, architecture, protestant, minister, robert, schuller, suggested, that, to, be, psychologically, healthy, human, beings, need, to, experience, their, natural, setting, the, setting, we, were, designed, for, which, is, the, garden, meanwhile, richard, kieckhefer, suggests, that, entering, into, a, religious, building, is, a, metaphor, for, entering, into, spiritual, relationship, kieckhefer, suggests, that, sacred, space, can, be, analyzed, by, three, factors, affecting, spiritual, process, longitudinal, space, emphasizes, the, procession, and, return, of, sacramental, acts, auditorium, space, is, suggestive, of, proclamation, and, response, and, new, forms, of, communal, space, designed, for, gathering, and, return, depend, to, a, great, degree, on, minimized, scale, to, enhance, intimacy, and, participation, in, worship, the, scholar, of, religious, studies, florin, george, c, lian, affirms, that, the, sacred, space, is, the, place, where, the, transcendent, becomes, immanent, and, where, the, devotee, can, access, god, sacred, architecture, spans, a, number, of, ancient, architectural, styles, including, neolithic, architecture, ancient, egyptian, architecture, and, sumerian, architecture, ancient, religious, buildings, particularly, temples, were, often, viewed, as, the, dwelling, place, the, temenos, of, the, gods, and, were, used, as, the, site, of, various, kinds, of, sacrifice, ancient, tombs, and, burial, structures, are, also, examples, of, architectural, structures, reflecting, religious, beliefs, of, their, various, societies, the, temple, of, karnak, at, thebes, egypt, was, constructed, across, a, period, of, 1300, years, and, its, numerous, temples, comprise, what, may, be, the, largest, religious, structure, ever, built, ancient, egyptian, religious, architecture, has, fascinated, archaeologists, and, captured, the, public, imagination, for, millennia, around, 600, bce, the, wooden, columns, of, the, temple, of, hera, at, olympia, were, replaced, by, stone, columns, with, the, spread, of, this, process, to, other, sanctuary, structures, a, few, stone, buildings, have, survived, through, the, ages, since, temples, are, the, only, buildings, which, survive, in, numbers, most, of, our, concept, of, classical, architecture, is, based, on, religious, structures, the, parthenon, which, served, as, a, treasury, building, as, well, as, a, place, for, veneration, of, deity, is, widely, regarded, as, the, greatest, example, of, classical, architecture, indian, architecture, is, related, to, the, history, and, religions, of, the, time, periods, as, well, as, to, the, geography, and, geology, of, the, indian, subcontinent, india, was, crisscrossed, by, trading, routes, of, merchants, from, as, far, away, as, siraf, and, china, as, well, as, weathering, invasions, by, foreigners, resulting, in, multiple, influences, of, foreign, elements, on, native, styles, the, diversity, of, indian, culture, is, represented, in, its, architecture, indian, architecture, comprises, a, blend, of, ancient, and, varied, native, traditions, with, building, types, forms, and, technologies, from, west, central, asia, and, europe, buddhist, architecture, developed, in, south, asia, beginning, in, the, third, century, bce, two, types, of, structures, are, associated, with, early, buddhism, viharas, and, stupas, originally, viharas, were, temporary, shelters, used, by, wandering, monks, during, the, rainy, season, but, these, structures, later, developed, to, accommodate, the, growing, and, increasingly, formalized, buddhist, monasticism, an, existing, example, is, at, nalanda, bihar, the, initial, function, of, the, stupa, was, the, veneration, and, safe, guarding, of, the, relics, of, the, buddha, the, earliest, existing, example, of, a, stupa, is, in, sanchi, madhya, pradesh, in, accordance, with, changes, in, religious, practice, stupas, were, gradually, incorporated, into, chaitya, grihas, stupa, halls, these, reached, their, highpoint, in, the, first, century, bce, exemplified, by, the, cave, complexes, of, ajanta, and, ellora, maharashtra, the, pagoda, is, an, evolution, of, the, indian, stupa, that, is, marked, by, a, tiered, tower, with, multiple, eaves, common, in, china, japan, korea, nepal, and, other, parts, of, asia, buddhist, temples, were, developed, rather, later, and, outside, south, asia, where, buddhism, gradually, declined, from, the, early, centuries, ce, onwards, though, an, early, example, is, that, of, the, mahabodhi, temple, at, bodh, gaya, in, bihar, the, architectural, structure, of, the, stupa, spread, across, asia, taking, on, many, diverse, forms, as, details, specific, to, different, regions, were, incorporated, into, the, overall, design, it, was, spread, to, china, and, the, asian, region, by, araniko, a, nepali, architect, in, the, early, 13th, century, for, kublai, khan, hindu, temple, architecture, is, based, on, sthapatya, veda, and, many, other, ancient, religious, texts, like, the, brihat, samhita, vastu, shastra, and, shilpa, shastras, in, accordance, to, the, design, principles, and, guidelines, believed, to, have, been, laid, by, the, divine, architect, vishvakarma, it, evolved, over, a, period, of, more, than, 2000, years, the, hindu, architecture, conforms, to, strict, religious, models, that, incorporate, elements, of, astronomy, and, sacred, geometry, in, hindu, belief, the, temple, represents, the, macrocosm, of, the, universe, as, well, as, the, microcosm, of, inner, space, while, the, underlying, form, of, hindu, temple, architecture, follows, strict, traditions, considerable, variation, occurs, with, the, often, intense, decorative, embellishments, and, ornamentation, byzantine, architecture, evolved, from, roman, architecture, eventually, a, style, emerged, incorporating, near, east, influences, and, the, greek, cross, plan, for, church, design, in, addition, brick, replaced, stone, classical, order, was, less, strictly, observed, mosaics, replaced, carved, decoration, and, complex, domes, were, erected, one, of, the, great, breakthroughs, in, the, history, of, western, architecture, occurred, when, justinian, i, s, architects, invented, a, complex, system, providing, for, a, smooth, transition, from, a, square, plan, of, the, church, to, a, circular, dome, or, domes, by, means, of, squinches, or, pendentives, the, prime, example, of, early, byzantine, religious, architecture, is, the, hagia, sophia, in, istanbul, the, religious, architecture, of, christian, churches, in, the, middle, ages, featured, the, latin, cross, plan, which, takes, the, roman, basilica, as, its, primary, model, with, subsequent, developments, it, consists, of, a, nave, transepts, and, the, altar, stands, at, the, east, end, see, cathedral, diagram, also, cathedrals, influenced, or, commissioned, by, justinian, i, employed, the, byzantine, style, of, domes, and, a, greek, cross, resembling, a, plus, sign, centering, attention, on, the, altar, at, the, center, of, the, church, the, church, of, the, intercession, on, the, nerl, is, an, excellent, example, of, russian, orthodox, architecture, in, the, middle, ages, the, urnes, stave, church, urnes, stavkyrkje, in, norway, is, a, superb, example, of, a, medieval, stave, church, gothic, architecture, was, particularly, associated, with, cathedrals, and, other, churches, which, flourished, in, europe, during, the, high, and, late, medieval, period, originating, in, 12th, century, france, it, was, known, during, the, period, as, opus, francigenum, french, work, the, style, originated, at, the, abbey, church, of, saint, denis, in, saint, denis, near, paris, other, notable, gothic, religious, structures, include, notre, dame, de, paris, the, cathedral, of, our, lady, of, amiens, and, the, chartres, cathedral, the, renaissance, brought, a, return, of, classical, influence, and, a, new, emphasis, on, rational, clarity, renaissance, architecture, represents, a, conscious, revival, of, roman, architecture, with, its, symmetry, mathematical, proportions, and, geometric, order, filippo, brunelleschi, s, plan, for, the, dome, of, the, florence, cathedral, in, 1418, was, one, of, the, first, important, religious, architectural, designs, of, the, italian, renaissance, architecture, the, evolution, from, renaissance, to, baroque, was, most, notably, experienced, in, religious, art, and, architecture, most, architectural, historians, regard, michelangelo, s, design, of, st, peter, s, basilica, in, rome, as, a, precursor, to, the, baroque, style, this, can, be, recognized, by, broader, interior, spaces, replacing, long, narrow, naves, more, playful, attention, to, light, and, shadow, extensive, ornamentation, large, frescoes, focus, on, interior, art, and, frequently, a, dramatic, central, exterior, projection, the, most, important, early, example, of, baroque, architecture, was, the, santa, susanna, by, carlo, maderno, st, paul, s, cathedral, in, london, by, christopher, wren, is, regarded, as, the, prime, example, of, the, rather, late, influence, of, the, baroque, style, in, england, temples, of, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, offer, a, unique, look, at, design, as, it, has, changed, from, the, simple, church, like, structure, of, the, kirtland, temple, built, in, the, 1830s, to, the, castellated, gothic, styles, of, the, early, utah, temples, to, the, dozens, of, modern, temples, built, today, early, temples, and, some, modern, temples, have, a, priesthood, assembly, room, with, two, sets, of, pulpits, at, each, end, of, the, room, with, chairs, or, benches, that, can, be, altered, to, face, either, way, most, but, not, all, temples, have, the, recognizable, statue, of, the, angel, moroni, atop, a, spire, the, nauvoo, temple, and, the, salt, lake, temple, are, adorned, with, symbolic, stonework, representing, various, aspects, of, the, faith, modern, architecture, spans, several, styles, with, similar, characteristics, resulting, in, simplification, of, form, and, the, elimination, of, ornament, the, most, influential, modernist, architects, in, the, early, to, mid, 20th, century, include, dominikus, b, hm, rudolf, schwarz, and, auguste, perret, while, secular, structures, clearly, had, the, greater, influence, on, the, development, of, modern, architecture, several, excellent, examples, of, modern, architecture, can, be, found, in, religious, buildings, of, the, 20th, century, for, example, unity, temple, in, chicago, is, a, unitarian, universalist, congregation, designed, by, frank, lloyd, wright, the, united, states, air, force, academy, cadet, chapel, started, in, 1954, and, completed, in, 1962, was, designed, by, walter, netsch, and, is, an, excellent, example, of, modern, religious, architecture, it, has, been, described, as, a, phalanx, of, fighters, turned, on, their, tails, and, pointing, heavenward, in, 1967, architect, pietro, belluschi, designed, the, strikingly, modern, cathedral, of, st, mary, of, the, assumption, san, francisco, the, first, catholic, cathedral, in, the, united, states, intended, to, conform, to, vatican, ii, postmodern, architecture, may, be, described, by, unapologetically, diverse, aesthetics, where, styles, collide, form, exists, for, its, own, sake, and, new, ways, of, viewing, familiar, styles, and, space, abound, the, temple, at, independence, missouri, was, conceived, by, japanese, architect, gyo, obata, after, the, concept, of, the, chambered, nautilus, the, catholic, cathedral, of, our, lady, of, the, angels, los, angeles, was, designed, in, 1998, by, jose, rafael, moneo, in, a, post, modern, style, the, structure, evokes, the, area, s, hispanic, heritage, through, the, use, of, adobe, coloring, while, combining, stark, modern, form, with, some, traditional, elements, the, basilica, of, our, lady, of, liche, on, the, other, hand, is, a, much, more, traditional, edifice, designed, by, barbara, bielecka, and, built, between, 1994, and, 2004, its, form, includes, references, to, a, number, of, polish, structures, the, columns, possess, a, slenderness, and, delicacy, inspired, by, those, of, the, renaissance, court, of, wawel, castle, in, krak, w, while, the, huge, 420, foot, spire, that, will, be, erected, next, to, the, basilica, bears, more, than, an, accidental, resemblance, to, the, baroque, spire, that, adorns, the, jasna, gora, monastery, of, czestochowa, home, of, the, black, madonna, shaker, communities, were, semiotically, architectured, upon, the, crux, of, the, compass, rose, byzantine, architecture, had, a, great, influence, on, early, islamic, architecture, with, its, characteristic, horseshoe, arches, vaults, and, domes, many, forms, of, mosques, have, evolved, in, different, regions, of, the, islamic, world, notable, mosque, types, include, the, early, abbasid, mosques, t, type, mosques, and, the, central, dome, mosques, of, anatolia, the, earliest, styles, in, islamic, architecture, produced, arab, plan, or, hypostyle, mosques, during, the, umayyad, dynasty, these, mosques, follow, a, square, or, rectangular, plan, with, enclosed, courtyard, and, covered, prayer, hall, most, early, hypostyle, mosques, had, flat, prayer, hall, roofs, which, required, numerous, columns, and, supports, the, mezquita, in, c, rdoba, spain, was, constructed, as, a, hypostyle, mosque, supported, by, over, 850, columns, arab, plan, mosques, continued, under, the, abbasid, dynasty, the, ottomans, introduced, central, dome, mosques, in, the, 15th, century, that, have, a, large, dome, centered, over, the, prayer, hall, in, addition, to, having, one, large, dome, at, the, center, there, are, often, smaller, domes, that, exist, off, center, over, the, prayer, hall, or, throughout, the, rest, of, the, mosque, in, areas, where, prayer, is, not, performed, the, dome, of, the, rock, mosque, in, jerusalem, is, perhaps, the, best, known, example, of, a, central, dome, mosque, iwan, mosques, are, most, notable, for, their, domed, chambers, and, iwans, which, are, vaulted, spaces, open, out, on, one, end, in, iwan, mosques, one, or, more, iwans, face, a, central, courtyard, that, serves, as, the, prayer, hall, the, style, represents, a, borrowing, from, pre, islamic, iranian, architecture, and, has, been, used, almost, exclusively, for, mosques, in, iran, many, iwan, mosques, are, converted, zoroastrian, fire, temples, where, the, courtyard, was, used, to, house, the, sacred, fire, today, iwan, mosques, are, no, longer, built, the, shah, mosque, in, isfahan, iran, is, a, classic, example, of, an, iwan, mosque, a, common, feature, in, mosques, is, the, minaret, the, tall, slender, tower, that, usually, is, situated, at, one, of, the, corners, of, the, mosque, structure, the, top, of, the, minaret, is, always, the, highest, point, in, mosques, that, have, one, and, often, the, highest, point, in, the, immediate, area, the, first, mosques, had, no, minarets, and, even, nowadays, the, most, conservative, islamic, movements, like, wahhabis, avoid, building, minarets, seeing, them, as, ostentatious, and, unnecessary, the, first, minaret, was, constructed, in, 665, in, basra, during, the, reign, of, the, umayyad, caliph, muawiyah, i, muawiyah, encouraged, the, construction, of, minarets, as, they, were, supposed, to, bring, mosques, on, par, with, christian, churches, with, their, bell, towers, consequently, mosque, architects, borrowed, the, shape, of, the, bell, tower, for, their, minarets, which, were, used, for, essentially, the, same, purpose, calling, the, faithful, to, prayer, domes, have, been, a, hallmark, of, islamic, architecture, since, the, 7th, century, as, time, progressed, the, sizes, of, mosque, domes, grew, from, occupying, only, a, small, part, of, the, roof, near, the, mihrab, to, encompassing, all, of, the, roof, above, the, prayer, hall, although, domes, normally, took, on, the, shape, of, a, hemisphere, the, mughals, in, india, popularized, onion, shaped, domes, in, south, asia, and, persia, the, prayer, hall, also, known, as, the, musalla, has, no, furniture, chairs, and, pews, are, absent, from, the, prayer, hall, prayer, halls, contain, no, images, of, people, animals, and, spiritual, figures, although, they, may, be, decorated, with, arabic, calligraphy, and, verses, from, the, qur, an, on, the, walls, usually, opposite, the, entrance, to, the, prayer, hall, is, the, qibla, wall, which, is, the, visually, emphasized, area, inside, the, prayer, hall, the, qibla, wall, is, normally, set, perpendicular, to, a, line, leading, to, mecca, worshipers, pray, in, rows, parallel, to, the, qibla, wall, and, thus, arrange, themselves, so, they, face, mecca, in, the, qibla, wall, usually, at, its, center, is, the, mihrab, a, niche, or, depression, indicating, the, qibla, wall, usually, the, mihrab, is, not, occupied, by, furniture, either, sometimes, especially, during, friday, prayers, a, raised, minbar, or, pulpit, is, located, to, the, side, of, the, mihrab, for, a, khatib, or, some, other, speaker, to, offer, a, sermon, khutbah, the, mihrab, serves, as, the, location, where, the, imam, leads, the, five, daily, prayers, on, a, regular, basis, mosques, often, have, ablution, fountains, or, other, facilities, for, washing, in, their, entryways, or, courtyards, however, worshipers, at, much, smaller, mosques, often, have, to, use, restrooms, to, perform, their, ablutions, in, traditional, mosques, this, function, is, often, elaborated, into, a, freestanding, building, in, the, center, of, a, courtyard, modern, mosques, may, have, a, variety, of, amenities, available, to, their, congregants, and, the, community, such, as, health, clinics, libraries, and, gymnasiums, bah, houses, of, worship, or, mas, hriqu, l, ad, hk, r, arabic, dawning, place, of, the, remembrance, of, god, exemplify, the, principles, of, the, bah, faith, of, unity, in, diversity, the, unity, of, god, the, unity, of, his, prophets, and, religions, and, the, unity, of, humanity, these, spiritual, principles, give, rise, to, new, forms, of, architectural, expression, that, serve, as, spaces, in, which, people, of, all, beliefs, cultures, and, backgrounds, gather, together, meditate, reflect, and, pray, and, around, which, will, be, built, social, humanitarian, educational, and, scientific, institutions, the, design, of, each, bah, house, of, worship, reflects, unifying, elements, of, their, environment, emerging, from, a, grassroots, approach, of, consultation, with, the, native, people, each, having, nine, sides, and, nine, entrances, the, number, nine, being, symbolic, of, unity, eight, continental, and, two, local, bah, houses, of, worship, have, been, built, so, far
