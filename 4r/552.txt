sculpture, is, the, branch, of, the, visual, arts, that, operates, in, three, dimensions, sculpture, is, the, three, dimensional, art, work, which, is, physically, presented, in, the, dimensions, of, height, width, and, depth, it, is, one, of, the, plastic, arts, durable, sculptural, processes, originally, used, carving, the, removal, of, material, and, modelling, the, addition, of, material, as, clay, in, stone, metal, ceramics, wood, and, other, materials, but, since, modernism, there, has, been, almost, complete, freedom, of, materials, and, process, a, wide, variety, of, materials, may, be, worked, by, removal, such, as, carving, assembled, by, welding, or, modelling, or, moulded, or, cast, sculpture, in, stone, survives, far, better, than, works, of, art, in, perishable, materials, and, often, represents, the, majority, of, the, surviving, works, other, than, pottery, from, ancient, cultures, though, conversely, traditions, of, sculpture, in, wood, may, have, vanished, almost, entirely, however, most, ancient, sculpture, was, brightly, painted, and, this, has, been, lost, sculpture, has, been, central, in, religious, devotion, in, many, cultures, and, until, recent, centuries, large, sculptures, too, expensive, for, private, individuals, to, create, were, usually, an, expression, of, religion, or, politics, those, cultures, whose, sculptures, have, survived, in, quantities, include, the, cultures, of, the, ancient, mediterranean, india, and, china, as, well, as, many, in, central, and, south, america, and, africa, the, western, tradition, of, sculpture, began, in, ancient, greece, and, greece, is, widely, seen, as, producing, great, masterpieces, in, the, classical, period, during, the, middle, ages, gothic, sculpture, represented, the, agonies, and, passions, of, the, christian, faith, the, revival, of, classical, models, in, the, renaissance, produced, famous, sculptures, such, as, michelangelo, s, statue, of, david, modernist, sculpture, moved, away, from, traditional, processes, and, the, emphasis, on, the, depiction, of, the, human, body, with, the, making, of, constructed, sculpture, and, the, presentation, of, found, objects, as, finished, artworks, a, distinction, exists, between, sculpture, in, the, round, free, standing, sculpture, such, as, statues, not, attached, except, possibly, at, the, base, to, any, other, surface, and, the, various, types, of, relief, which, are, at, least, partly, attached, to, a, background, surface, relief, is, often, classified, by, the, degree, of, projection, from, the, wall, into, low, or, bas, relief, high, relief, and, sometimes, an, intermediate, mid, relief, sunk, relief, is, a, technique, restricted, to, ancient, egypt, relief, is, the, usual, sculptural, medium, for, large, figure, groups, and, narrative, subjects, which, are, difficult, to, accomplish, in, the, round, and, is, the, typical, technique, used, both, for, architectural, sculpture, which, is, attached, to, buildings, and, for, small, scale, sculpture, decorating, other, objects, as, in, much, pottery, metalwork, and, jewellery, relief, sculpture, may, also, decorate, steles, upright, slabs, usually, of, stone, often, also, containing, inscriptions, another, basic, distinction, is, between, subtractive, carving, techniques, which, remove, material, from, an, existing, block, or, lump, for, example, of, stone, or, wood, and, modelling, techniques, which, shape, or, build, up, the, work, from, the, material, techniques, such, as, casting, stamping, and, moulding, use, an, intermediate, matrix, containing, the, design, to, produce, the, work, many, of, these, allow, the, production, of, several, copies, the, term, sculpture, is, often, used, mainly, to, describe, large, works, which, are, sometimes, called, monumental, sculpture, meaning, either, or, both, of, sculpture, that, is, large, or, that, is, attached, to, a, building, but, the, term, properly, covers, many, types, of, small, works, in, three, dimensions, using, the, same, techniques, including, coins, and, medals, hardstone, carvings, a, term, for, small, carvings, in, stone, that, can, take, detailed, work, the, very, large, or, colossal, statue, has, had, an, enduring, appeal, since, antiquity, the, largest, on, record, at, 182, m, 597, ft, is, the, 2018, indian, statue, of, unity, another, grand, form, of, portrait, sculpture, is, the, equestrian, statue, of, a, rider, on, horse, which, has, become, rare, in, recent, decades, the, smallest, forms, of, life, size, portrait, sculpture, are, the, head, showing, just, that, or, the, bust, a, representation, of, a, person, from, the, chest, up, small, forms, of, sculpture, include, the, figurine, normally, a, statue, that, is, no, more, than, 18, inches, 46, cm, tall, and, for, reliefs, the, plaquette, medal, or, coin, modern, and, contemporary, art, have, added, a, number, of, non, traditional, forms, of, sculpture, including, sound, sculpture, light, sculpture, environmental, art, environmental, sculpture, street, art, sculpture, kinetic, sculpture, involving, aspects, of, physical, motion, land, art, and, site, specific, art, sculpture, is, an, important, form, of, public, art, a, collection, of, sculpture, in, a, garden, setting, can, be, called, a, sculpture, garden, there, is, also, a, view, that, buildings, are, a, type, of, sculpture, with, constantin, br, ncu, i, describing, architecture, as, inhabited, sculpture, one, of, the, most, common, purposes, of, sculpture, is, in, some, form, of, association, with, religion, cult, images, are, common, in, many, cultures, though, they, are, often, not, the, colossal, statues, of, deities, which, characterized, ancient, greek, art, like, the, statue, of, zeus, at, olympia, the, actual, cult, images, in, the, innermost, sanctuaries, of, egyptian, temples, of, which, none, have, survived, were, evidently, rather, small, even, in, the, largest, temples, the, same, is, often, true, in, hinduism, where, the, very, simple, and, ancient, form, of, the, lingam, is, the, most, common, buddhism, brought, the, sculpture, of, religious, figures, to, east, asia, where, there, seems, to, have, been, no, earlier, equivalent, tradition, though, again, simple, shapes, like, the, bi, and, cong, probably, had, religious, significance, small, sculptures, as, personal, possessions, go, back, to, the, earliest, prehistoric, art, and, the, use, of, very, large, sculpture, as, public, art, especially, to, impress, the, viewer, with, the, power, of, a, ruler, goes, back, at, least, to, the, great, sphinx, of, some, 4, 500, years, ago, in, archaeology, and, art, history, the, appearance, and, sometimes, disappearance, of, large, or, monumental, sculpture, in, a, culture, is, regarded, as, of, great, significance, though, tracing, the, emergence, is, often, complicated, by, the, presumed, existence, of, sculpture, in, wood, and, other, perishable, materials, of, which, no, record, remains, the, totem, pole, is, an, example, of, a, tradition, of, monumental, sculpture, in, wood, that, would, leave, no, traces, for, archaeology, the, ability, to, summon, the, resources, to, create, monumental, sculpture, by, transporting, usually, very, heavy, materials, and, arranging, for, the, payment, of, what, are, usually, regarded, as, full, time, sculptors, is, considered, a, mark, of, a, relatively, advanced, culture, in, terms, of, social, organization, recent, unexpected, discoveries, of, ancient, chinese, bronze, age, figures, at, sanxingdui, some, more, than, twice, human, size, have, disturbed, many, ideas, held, about, early, chinese, civilization, since, only, much, smaller, bronzes, were, previously, known, some, undoubtedly, advanced, cultures, such, as, the, indus, valley, civilization, appear, to, have, had, no, monumental, sculpture, at, all, though, producing, very, sophisticated, figurines, and, seals, the, mississippian, culture, seems, to, have, been, progressing, towards, its, use, with, small, stone, figures, when, it, collapsed, other, cultures, such, as, ancient, egypt, and, the, easter, island, culture, seem, to, have, devoted, enormous, resources, to, very, large, scale, monumental, sculpture, from, a, very, early, stage, the, collecting, of, sculpture, including, that, of, earlier, periods, goes, back, some, 2, 000, years, in, greece, china, and, mesoamerica, and, many, collections, were, available, on, semi, public, display, long, before, the, modern, museum, was, invented, from, the, 20th, century, the, relatively, restricted, range, of, subjects, found, in, large, sculpture, expanded, greatly, with, abstract, subjects, and, the, use, or, representation, of, any, type, of, subject, now, common, today, much, sculpture, is, made, for, intermittent, display, in, galleries, and, museums, and, the, ability, to, transport, and, store, the, increasingly, large, works, is, a, factor, in, their, construction, small, decorative, figurines, most, often, in, ceramics, are, as, popular, today, though, strangely, neglected, by, modern, and, contemporary, art, as, they, were, in, the, rococo, or, in, ancient, greece, when, tanagra, figurines, were, a, major, industry, or, in, east, asian, and, pre, columbian, art, small, sculpted, fittings, for, furniture, and, other, objects, go, well, back, into, antiquity, as, in, the, nimrud, ivories, begram, ivories, and, finds, from, the, tomb, of, tutankhamun, portrait, sculpture, began, in, egypt, where, the, narmer, palette, shows, a, ruler, of, the, 32nd, century, bce, and, mesopotamia, where, we, have, 27, surviving, statues, of, gudea, who, ruled, lagash, c, 2144, 2124, bce, in, ancient, greece, and, rome, the, erection, of, a, portrait, statue, in, a, public, place, was, almost, the, highest, mark, of, honour, and, the, ambition, of, the, elite, who, might, also, be, depicted, on, a, coin, in, other, cultures, such, as, egypt, and, the, near, east, public, statues, were, almost, exclusively, the, preserve, of, the, ruler, with, other, wealthy, people, only, being, portrayed, in, their, tombs, rulers, are, typically, the, only, people, given, portraits, in, pre, columbian, cultures, beginning, with, the, olmec, colossal, heads, of, about, 3, 000, years, ago, east, asian, portrait, sculpture, was, entirely, religious, with, leading, clergy, being, commemorated, with, statues, especially, the, founders, of, monasteries, but, not, rulers, or, ancestors, the, mediterranean, tradition, revived, initially, only, for, tomb, effigies, and, coins, in, the, middle, ages, but, expanded, greatly, in, the, renaissance, which, invented, new, forms, such, as, the, personal, portrait, medal, animals, are, with, the, human, figure, the, earliest, subject, for, sculpture, and, have, always, been, popular, sometimes, realistic, but, often, imaginary, monsters, in, china, animals, and, monsters, are, almost, the, only, traditional, subjects, for, stone, sculpture, outside, tombs, and, temples, the, kingdom, of, plants, is, important, only, in, jewellery, and, decorative, reliefs, but, these, form, almost, all, the, large, sculpture, of, byzantine, art, and, islamic, art, and, are, very, important, in, most, eurasian, traditions, where, motifs, such, as, the, palmette, and, vine, scroll, have, passed, east, and, west, for, over, two, millennia, one, form, of, sculpture, found, in, many, prehistoric, cultures, around, the, world, is, specially, enlarged, versions, of, ordinary, tools, weapons, or, vessels, created, in, impractical, precious, materials, for, either, some, form, of, ceremonial, use, or, display, or, as, offerings, jade, or, other, types, of, greenstone, were, used, in, china, olmec, mexico, and, neolithic, europe, and, in, early, mesopotamia, large, pottery, shapes, were, produced, in, stone, bronze, was, used, in, europe, and, china, for, large, axes, and, blades, like, the, oxborough, dirk, the, materials, used, in, sculpture, are, diverse, changing, throughout, history, the, classic, materials, with, outstanding, durability, are, metal, especially, bronze, stone, and, pottery, with, wood, bone, and, antler, less, durable, but, cheaper, options, precious, materials, such, as, gold, silver, jade, and, ivory, are, often, used, for, small, luxury, works, and, sometimes, in, larger, ones, as, in, chryselephantine, statues, more, common, and, less, expensive, materials, were, used, for, sculpture, for, wider, consumption, including, hardwoods, such, as, oak, box, boxwood, and, lime, linden, terracotta, and, other, ceramics, wax, a, very, common, material, for, models, for, casting, and, receiving, the, impressions, of, cylinder, seals, and, engraved, gems, and, cast, metals, such, as, pewter, and, zinc, spelter, but, a, vast, number, of, other, materials, have, been, used, as, part, of, sculptures, in, ethnographic, and, ancient, works, as, much, as, modern, ones, sculptures, are, often, painted, but, commonly, lose, their, paint, to, time, or, restorers, many, different, painting, techniques, have, been, used, in, making, sculpture, including, tempera, oil, painting, gilding, house, paint, aerosol, enamel, and, sandblasting, many, sculptors, seek, new, ways, and, materials, to, make, art, one, of, pablo, picasso, s, most, famous, sculptures, included, bicycle, parts, alexander, calder, and, other, modernists, made, spectacular, use, of, painted, steel, since, the, 1960s, acrylics, and, other, plastics, have, been, used, as, well, andy, goldsworthy, makes, his, unusually, ephemeral, sculptures, from, almost, entirely, natural, materials, in, natural, settings, some, sculpture, such, as, ice, sculpture, sand, sculpture, and, gas, sculpture, is, deliberately, short, lived, recent, sculptors, have, used, stained, glass, tools, machine, parts, hardware, and, consumer, packaging, to, fashion, their, works, sculptors, sometimes, use, found, objects, and, chinese, scholar, s, rocks, have, been, appreciated, for, many, centuries, stone, sculpture, is, an, ancient, activity, where, pieces, of, rough, natural, stone, are, shaped, by, the, controlled, removal, of, stone, owing, to, the, permanence, of, the, material, evidence, can, be, found, that, even, the, earliest, societies, indulged, in, some, form, of, stone, work, though, not, all, areas, of, the, world, have, such, abundance, of, good, stone, for, carving, as, egypt, greece, india, and, most, of, europe, petroglyphs, also, called, rock, engravings, are, perhaps, the, earliest, form, images, created, by, removing, part, of, a, rock, surface, which, remains, in, situ, by, incising, pecking, carving, and, abrading, monumental, sculpture, covers, large, works, and, architectural, sculpture, which, is, attached, to, buildings, hardstone, carving, is, the, carving, for, artistic, purposes, of, semi, precious, stones, such, as, jade, agate, onyx, rock, crystal, sard, or, carnelian, and, a, general, term, for, an, object, made, in, this, way, alabaster, or, mineral, gypsum, is, a, soft, mineral, that, is, easy, to, carve, for, smaller, works, and, still, relatively, durable, engraved, gems, are, small, carved, gems, including, cameos, originally, used, as, seal, rings, the, copying, of, an, original, statue, in, stone, which, was, very, important, for, ancient, greek, statues, which, are, nearly, all, known, from, copies, was, traditionally, achieved, by, pointing, along, with, more, freehand, methods, pointing, involved, setting, up, a, grid, of, string, squares, on, a, wooden, frame, surrounding, the, original, and, then, measuring, the, position, on, the, grid, and, the, distance, between, grid, and, statue, of, a, series, of, individual, points, and, then, using, this, information, to, carve, into, the, block, from, which, the, copy, is, made, bronze, and, related, copper, alloys, are, the, oldest, and, still, the, most, popular, metals, for, cast, metal, sculptures, a, cast, bronze, sculpture, is, often, called, simply, a, bronze, common, bronze, alloys, have, the, unusual, and, desirable, property, of, expanding, slightly, just, before, they, set, thus, filling, the, finest, details, of, a, mould, their, strength, and, lack, of, brittleness, ductility, is, an, advantage, when, figures, in, action, are, to, be, created, especially, when, compared, to, various, ceramic, or, stone, materials, see, marble, sculpture, for, several, examples, gold, is, the, softest, and, most, precious, metal, and, very, important, in, jewellery, with, silver, it, is, soft, enough, to, be, worked, with, hammers, and, other, tools, as, well, as, cast, repouss, and, chasing, are, among, the, techniques, used, in, gold, and, silversmithing, casting, is, a, group, of, manufacturing, processes, by, which, a, liquid, material, bronze, copper, glass, aluminum, iron, is, usually, poured, into, a, mould, which, contains, a, hollow, cavity, of, the, desired, shape, and, then, allowed, to, solidify, the, solid, casting, is, then, ejected, or, broken, out, to, complete, the, process, although, a, final, stage, of, cold, work, may, follow, on, the, finished, cast, casting, may, be, used, to, form, hot, liquid, metals, or, various, materials, that, cold, set, after, mixing, of, components, such, as, epoxies, concrete, plaster, and, clay, casting, is, most, often, used, for, making, complex, shapes, that, would, be, otherwise, difficult, or, uneconomical, to, make, by, other, methods, the, oldest, surviving, casting, is, a, copper, mesopotamian, frog, from, 3200, bce, specific, techniques, include, lost, wax, casting, plaster, mould, casting, and, sand, casting, welding, is, a, process, where, different, pieces, of, metal, are, fused, together, to, create, different, shapes, and, designs, there, are, many, different, forms, of, welding, such, as, oxy, fuel, welding, stick, welding, mig, welding, and, tig, welding, oxy, fuel, is, probably, the, most, common, method, of, welding, when, it, comes, to, creating, steel, sculptures, because, it, is, the, easiest, to, use, for, shaping, the, steel, as, well, as, making, clean, and, less, noticeable, joins, of, the, steel, the, key, to, oxy, fuel, welding, is, heating, each, piece, of, metal, to, be, joined, evenly, until, all, are, red, and, have, a, shine, to, them, once, that, shine, is, on, each, piece, that, shine, will, soon, become, a, pool, where, the, metal, is, liquified, and, the, welder, must, get, the, pools, to, join, fusing, the, metal, once, cooled, off, the, location, where, the, pools, joined, are, now, one, continuous, piece, of, metal, also, used, heavily, in, oxy, fuel, sculpture, creation, is, forging, forging, is, the, process, of, heating, metal, to, a, certain, point, to, soften, it, enough, to, be, shaped, into, different, forms, one, very, common, example, is, heating, the, end, of, a, steel, rod, and, hitting, the, red, heated, tip, with, a, hammer, while, on, an, anvil, to, form, a, point, in, between, hammer, swings, the, forger, rotates, the, rod, and, gradually, forms, a, sharpened, point, from, the, blunt, end, of, a, steel, rod, glass, may, be, used, for, sculpture, through, a, wide, range, of, working, techniques, though, the, use, of, it, for, large, works, is, a, recent, development, it, can, be, carved, though, with, considerable, difficulty, the, roman, lycurgus, cup, is, all, but, unique, there, are, various, ways, of, moulding, glass, hot, casting, can, be, done, by, ladling, molten, glass, into, moulds, that, have, been, created, by, pressing, shapes, into, sand, carved, graphite, or, detailed, plaster, silica, moulds, kiln, casting, glass, involves, heating, chunks, of, glass, in, a, kiln, until, they, are, liquid, and, flow, into, a, waiting, mould, below, it, in, the, kiln, hot, glass, can, also, be, blown, and, or, hot, sculpted, with, hand, tools, either, as, a, solid, mass, or, as, part, of, a, blown, object, more, recent, techniques, involve, chiseling, and, bonding, plate, glass, with, polymer, silicates, and, uv, light, pottery, is, one, of, the, oldest, materials, for, sculpture, as, well, as, clay, being, the, medium, in, which, many, sculptures, cast, in, metal, are, originally, modelled, for, casting, sculptors, often, build, small, preliminary, works, called, maquettes, of, ephemeral, materials, such, as, plaster, of, paris, wax, unfired, clay, or, plasticine, many, cultures, have, produced, pottery, which, combines, a, function, as, a, vessel, with, a, sculptural, form, and, small, figurines, have, often, been, as, popular, as, they, are, in, modern, western, culture, stamps, and, moulds, were, used, by, most, ancient, civilizations, from, ancient, rome, and, mesopotamia, to, china, wood, carving, has, been, extremely, widely, practiced, but, survives, much, less, well, than, the, other, main, materials, being, vulnerable, to, decay, insect, damage, and, fire, it, therefore, forms, an, important, hidden, element, in, the, art, history, of, many, cultures, outdoor, wood, sculpture, does, not, last, long, in, most, parts, of, the, world, so, that, we, have, little, idea, how, the, totem, pole, tradition, developed, many, of, the, most, important, sculptures, of, china, and, japan, in, particular, are, in, wood, and, the, great, majority, of, african, sculpture, and, that, of, oceania, and, other, regions, wood, is, light, so, suitable, for, masks, and, other, sculpture, intended, to, be, carried, and, can, take, very, fine, detail, it, is, also, much, easier, to, work, than, stone, it, has, been, very, often, painted, after, carving, but, the, paint, wears, less, well, than, the, wood, and, is, often, missing, in, surviving, pieces, painted, wood, is, often, technically, described, as, wood, and, polychrome, typically, a, layer, of, gesso, or, plaster, is, applied, to, the, wood, and, then, the, paint, is, applied, to, that, three, dimensional, work, incorporating, unconventional, materials, such, as, cloth, fur, plastics, rubber, and, nylon, that, can, thus, be, stuffed, sewn, hung, draped, or, woven, are, known, as, soft, sculptures, well, known, creators, of, soft, sculptures, include, claes, oldenburg, yayoi, kusama, eva, hesse, sarah, lucas, and, magdalena, abakanowicz, worldwide, sculptors, have, usually, been, tradespeople, whose, work, is, unsigned, in, some, traditions, for, example, china, where, sculpture, did, not, share, the, prestige, of, literati, painting, this, has, affected, the, status, of, sculpture, itself, even, in, ancient, greece, where, sculptors, such, as, phidias, became, famous, they, appear, to, have, retained, much, the, same, social, status, as, other, artisans, and, perhaps, not, much, greater, financial, rewards, although, some, signed, their, works, in, the, middle, ages, artists, such, as, the, 12th, century, gislebertus, sometimes, signed, their, work, and, were, sought, after, by, different, cities, especially, from, the, trecento, onwards, in, italy, with, figures, such, as, arnolfo, di, cambio, and, nicola, pisano, and, his, son, giovanni, goldsmiths, and, jewellers, dealing, with, precious, materials, and, often, doubling, as, bankers, belonged, to, powerful, guilds, and, had, considerable, status, often, holding, civic, office, many, sculptors, also, practised, in, other, arts, andrea, del, verrocchio, also, painted, and, giovanni, pisano, michelangelo, and, jacopo, sansovino, were, architects, some, sculptors, maintained, large, workshops, even, in, the, renaissance, the, physical, nature, of, the, work, was, perceived, by, leonardo, da, vinci, and, others, as, pulling, down, the, status, of, sculpture, in, the, arts, though, the, reputation, of, michelangelo, perhaps, put, this, long, held, idea, to, rest, from, the, high, renaissance, artists, such, as, michelangelo, leone, leoni, and, giambologna, could, become, wealthy, and, ennobled, and, enter, the, circle, of, princes, after, a, period, of, sharp, argument, over, the, relative, status, of, sculpture, and, painting, much, decorative, sculpture, on, buildings, remained, a, trade, but, sculptors, producing, individual, pieces, were, recognised, on, a, level, with, painters, from, the, 18th, century, or, earlier, sculpture, also, attracted, middle, class, students, although, it, was, slower, to, do, so, than, painting, women, sculptors, took, longer, to, appear, than, women, painters, and, were, less, prominent, until, the, 20th, century, aniconism, originated, with, judaism, which, did, not, accept, figurative, sculpture, until, the, 19th, century, before, expanding, to, christianity, which, initially, accepted, large, sculptures, in, christianity, and, buddhism, sculpture, became, very, significant, christian, eastern, orthodoxy, has, never, accepted, monumental, sculpture, and, islam, has, consistently, rejected, nearly, all, figurative, sculpture, except, for, very, small, figures, in, reliefs, and, some, animal, figures, that, fulfill, a, useful, function, like, the, famous, lions, supporting, a, fountain, in, the, alhambra, many, forms, of, protestantism, also, do, not, approve, of, religious, sculpture, there, has, been, much, iconoclasm, of, sculpture, for, religious, motives, from, the, early, christians, and, the, beeldenstorm, of, the, protestant, reformation, to, the, 2001, destruction, of, the, buddhas, of, bamyan, by, the, taliban, the, earliest, undisputed, examples, of, sculpture, belong, to, the, aurignacian, culture, which, was, located, in, europe, and, southwest, asia, and, active, at, the, beginning, of, the, upper, paleolithic, as, well, as, producing, some, of, the, earliest, known, cave, art, the, people, of, this, culture, developed, finely, crafted, stone, tools, manufacturing, pendants, bracelets, ivory, beads, and, bone, flutes, as, well, as, three, dimensional, figurines, the, 30, cm, tall, l, wenmensch, found, in, the, hohlenstein, stadel, area, of, germany, is, an, anthropomorphic, lion, human, figure, carved, from, woolly, mammoth, ivory, it, has, been, dated, to, about, 35, 40, 000, bp, making, it, along, with, the, venus, of, hohle, fels, the, oldest, known, uncontested, examples, of, sculpture, much, surviving, prehistoric, art, is, small, portable, sculptures, with, a, small, group, of, female, venus, figurines, such, as, the, venus, of, willendorf, 24, 26, 000, bp, found, across, central, europe, the, swimming, reindeer, of, about, 13, 000, years, ago, is, one, of, the, finest, of, a, number, of, magdalenian, carvings, in, bone, or, antler, of, animals, in, the, art, of, the, upper, paleolithic, although, they, are, outnumbered, by, engraved, pieces, which, are, sometimes, classified, as, sculpture, two, of, the, largest, prehistoric, sculptures, can, be, found, at, the, tuc, d, audobert, caves, in, france, where, around, 12, 17, 000, years, ago, a, masterful, sculptor, used, a, spatula, like, stone, tool, and, fingers, to, model, a, pair, of, large, bison, in, clay, against, a, limestone, rock, with, the, beginning, of, the, mesolithic, in, europe, figurative, sculpture, greatly, reduced, and, remained, a, less, common, element, in, art, than, relief, decoration, of, practical, objects, until, the, roman, period, despite, some, works, such, as, the, gundestrup, cauldron, from, the, european, iron, age, and, the, bronze, age, trundholm, sun, chariot, from, the, ancient, near, east, the, over, life, sized, stone, urfa, man, from, modern, turkey, comes, from, about, 9, 000, bce, and, the, ain, ghazal, statues, from, around, 7200, and, 6500, bce, these, are, from, modern, jordan, made, of, lime, plaster, and, reeds, and, about, half, life, size, there, are, 15, statues, some, with, two, heads, side, by, side, and, 15, busts, small, clay, figures, of, people, and, animals, are, found, at, many, sites, across, the, near, east, from, the, pre, pottery, neolithic, and, represent, the, start, of, a, more, or, less, continuous, tradition, in, the, region, the, protoliterate, period, in, mesopotamia, dominated, by, uruk, saw, the, production, of, sophisticated, works, like, the, warka, vase, and, cylinder, seals, the, guennol, lioness, is, an, outstanding, small, limestone, figure, from, elam, of, about, 3000, 2800, bce, part, human, and, part, lioness, a, little, later, there, are, a, number, of, figures, of, large, eyed, priests, and, worshippers, mostly, in, alabaster, and, up, to, a, foot, high, who, attended, temple, cult, images, of, the, deity, but, very, few, of, these, have, survived, sculptures, from, the, sumerian, and, akkadian, period, generally, had, large, staring, eyes, and, long, beards, on, the, men, many, masterpieces, have, also, been, found, at, the, royal, cemetery, at, ur, c, 2650, bce, including, the, two, figures, of, a, ram, in, a, thicket, the, copper, bull, and, a, bull, s, head, on, one, of, the, lyres, of, ur, from, the, many, subsequent, periods, before, the, ascendency, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, in, the, 10th, century, bce, mesopotamian, art, survives, in, a, number, of, forms, cylinder, seals, relatively, small, figures, in, the, round, and, reliefs, of, various, sizes, including, cheap, plaques, of, moulded, pottery, for, the, home, some, religious, and, some, apparently, not, the, burney, relief, is, an, unusually, elaborate, and, relatively, large, 20, x, 15,

and, may, also, be, moulded, stone, stelae, votive, offerings, or, ones, probably, commemorating, victories, and, showing, feasts, are, also, found, from, temples, which, unlike, more, official, ones, lack, inscriptions, that, would, explain, them, the, fragmentary, stele, of, the, vultures, is, an, early, example, of, the, inscribed, type, and, the, assyrian, black, obelisk, of, shalmaneser, iii, a, large, and, solid, late, one, the, conquest, of, the, whole, of, mesopotamia, and, much, surrounding, territory, by, the, assyrians, created, a, larger, and, wealthier, state, than, the, region, had, known, before, and, very, grandiose, art, in, palaces, and, public, places, no, doubt, partly, intended, to, match, the, splendour, of, the, art, of, the, neighbouring, egyptian, empire, unlike, earlier, states, the, assyrians, could, use, easily, carved, stone, from, northern, iraq, and, did, so, in, great, quantity, the, assyrians, developed, a, style, of, extremely, large, schemes, of, very, finely, detailed, narrative, low, reliefs, in, stone, for, palaces, with, scenes, of, war, or, hunting, the, british, museum, has, an, outstanding, collection, including, the, lion, hunt, of, ashurbanipal, and, the, lachish, reliefs, showing, a, campaign, they, produced, very, little, sculpture, in, the, round, except, for, colossal, guardian, figures, of, the, human, headed, lamassu, which, are, sculpted, in, high, relief, on, two, sides, of, a, rectangular, block, with, the, heads, effectively, in, the, round, and, also, five, legs, so, that, both, views, seem, complete, even, before, dominating, the, region, they, had, continued, the, cylinder, seal, tradition, with, designs, which, are, often, exceptionally, energetic, and, refined, the, monumental, sculpture, of, ancient, egypt, is, world, famous, but, refined, and, delicate, small, works, exist, in, much, greater, numbers, the, egyptians, used, the, distinctive, technique, of, sunk, relief, which, is, well, suited, to, very, bright, sunlight, the, main, figures, in, reliefs, adhere, to, the, same, figure, convention, as, in, painting, with, parted, legs, where, not, seated, and, head, shown, from, the, side, but, the, torso, from, the, front, and, a, standard, set, of, proportions, making, up, the, figure, using, 18, fists, to, go, from, the, ground, to, the, hair, line, on, the, forehead, this, appears, as, early, as, the, narmer, palette, from, dynasty, i, however, there, as, elsewhere, the, convention, is, not, used, for, minor, figures, shown, engaged, in, some, activity, such, as, the, captives, and, corpses, other, conventions, make, statues, of, males, darker, than, females, ones, very, conventionalized, portrait, statues, appear, from, as, early, as, dynasty, ii, before, 2, 780, bce, and, with, the, exception, of, the, art, of, the, amarna, period, of, ahkenaten, and, some, other, periods, such, as, dynasty, xii, the, idealized, features, of, rulers, like, other, egyptian, artistic, conventions, changed, little, until, after, the, greek, conquest, egyptian, pharaohs, were, always, regarded, as, deities, but, other, deities, are, much, less, common, in, large, statues, except, when, they, represent, the, pharaoh, as, another, deity, however, the, other, deities, are, frequently, shown, in, paintings, and, reliefs, the, famous, row, of, four, colossal, statues, outside, the, main, temple, at, abu, simbel, each, show, rameses, ii, a, typical, scheme, though, here, exceptionally, large, small, figures, of, deities, or, their, animal, personifications, are, very, common, and, found, in, popular, materials, such, as, pottery, most, larger, sculpture, survives, from, egyptian, temples, or, tombs, by, dynasty, iv, 2680, 2565, bce, at, the, latest, the, idea, of, the, ka, statue, was, firmly, established, these, were, put, in, tombs, as, a, resting, place, for, the, ka, portion, of, the, soul, and, so, we, have, a, good, number, of, less, conventionalized, statues, of, well, off, administrators, and, their, wives, many, in, wood, as, egypt, is, one, of, the, few, places, in, the, world, where, the, climate, allows, wood, to, survive, over, millennia, the, so, called, reserve, heads, plain, hairless, heads, are, especially, naturalistic, early, tombs, also, contained, small, models, of, the, slaves, animals, buildings, and, objects, such, as, boats, necessary, for, the, deceased, to, continue, his, lifestyle, in, the, afterworld, and, later, ushabti, figures, the, first, distinctive, style, of, ancient, greek, sculpture, developed, in, the, early, bronze, age, cycladic, period, 3rd, millennium, bce, where, marble, figures, usually, female, and, small, are, represented, in, an, elegantly, simplified, geometrical, style, most, typical, is, a, standing, pose, with, arms, crossed, in, front, but, other, figures, are, shown, in, different, poses, including, a, complicated, figure, of, a, harpist, seated, on, a, chair, the, subsequent, minoan, and, mycenaean, cultures, developed, sculpture, further, under, influence, from, syria, and, elsewhere, but, it, is, in, the, later, archaic, period, from, around, 650, bce, that, the, kouros, developed, these, are, large, standing, statues, of, naked, youths, found, in, temples, and, tombs, with, the, kore, as, the, clothed, female, equivalent, with, elaborately, dressed, hair, both, have, the, archaic, smile, they, seem, to, have, served, a, number, of, functions, perhaps, sometimes, representing, deities, and, sometimes, the, person, buried, in, a, grave, as, with, the, kroisos, kouros, they, are, clearly, influenced, by, egyptian, and, syrian, styles, but, the, greek, artists, were, much, more, ready, to, experiment, within, the, style, during, the, 6th, century, greek, sculpture, developed, rapidly, becoming, more, naturalistic, and, with, much, more, active, and, varied, figure, poses, in, narrative, scenes, though, still, within, idealized, conventions, sculptured, pediments, were, added, to, temples, including, the, parthenon, in, athens, where, the, remains, of, the, pediment, of, around, 520, using, figures, in, the, round, were, fortunately, used, as, infill, for, new, buildings, after, the, persian, sack, in, 480, bce, and, recovered, from, the, 1880s, on, in, fresh, unweathered, condition, other, significant, remains, of, architectural, sculpture, come, from, paestum, in, italy, corfu, delphi, and, the, temple, of, aphaea, in, aegina, much, now, in, munich, most, greek, sculpture, originally, included, at, least, some, colour, the, ny, carlsberg, glyptotek, museum, in, copenhagen, denmark, has, done, extensive, research, and, recreation, of, the, original, colours, there, are, fewer, original, remains, from, the, first, phase, of, the, classical, period, often, called, the, severe, style, free, standing, statues, were, now, mostly, made, in, bronze, which, always, had, value, as, scrap, the, severe, style, lasted, from, around, 500, in, reliefs, and, soon, after, 480, in, statues, to, about, 450, the, relatively, rigid, poses, of, figures, relaxed, and, asymmetrical, turning, positions, and, oblique, views, became, common, and, deliberately, sought, this, was, combined, with, a, better, understanding, of, anatomy, and, the, harmonious, structure, of, sculpted, figures, and, the, pursuit, of, naturalistic, representation, as, an, aim, which, had, not, been, present, before, excavations, at, the, temple, of, zeus, olympia, since, 1829, have, revealed, the, largest, group, of, remains, from, about, 460, of, which, many, are, in, the, louvre, the, high, classical, period, lasted, only, a, few, decades, from, about, 450, to, 400, but, has, had, a, momentous, influence, on, art, and, retains, a, special, prestige, despite, a, very, restricted, number, of, original, survivals, the, best, known, works, are, the, parthenon, marbles, traditionally, since, plutarch, executed, by, a, team, led, by, the, most, famous, ancient, greek, sculptor, phidias, active, from, about, 465, 425, who, was, in, his, own, day, more, famous, for, his, colossal, chryselephantine, statue, of, zeus, at, olympia, c, 432, one, of, the, seven, wonders, of, the, ancient, world, his, athena, parthenos, 438, the, cult, image, of, the, parthenon, and, athena, promachos, a, colossal, bronze, figure, that, stood, next, to, the, parthenon, all, of, these, are, lost, but, are, known, from, many, representations, he, is, also, credited, as, the, creator, of, some, life, size, bronze, statues, known, only, from, later, copies, whose, identification, is, controversial, including, the, ludovisi, hermes, the, high, classical, style, continued, to, develop, realism, and, sophistication, in, the, human, figure, and, improved, the, depiction, of, drapery, clothes, using, it, to, add, to, the, impact, of, active, poses, facial, expressions, were, usually, very, restrained, even, in, combat, scenes, the, composition, of, groups, of, figures, in, reliefs, and, on, pediments, combined, complexity, and, harmony, in, a, way, that, had, a, permanent, influence, on, western, art, relief, could, be, very, high, indeed, as, in, the, parthenon, illustration, below, where, most, of, the, leg, of, the, warrior, is, completely, detached, from, the, background, as, were, the, missing, parts, relief, this, high, made, sculptures, more, subject, to, damage, the, late, classical, style, developed, the, free, standing, female, nude, statue, supposedly, an, innovation, of, praxiteles, and, developed, increasingly, complex, and, subtle, poses, that, were, interesting, when, viewed, from, a, number, of, angles, as, well, as, more, expressive, faces, both, trends, were, to, be, taken, much, further, in, the, hellenistic, period, the, hellenistic, period, is, conventionally, dated, from, the, death, of, alexander, the, great, in, 323, bce, and, ending, either, with, the, final, conquest, of, the, greek, heartlands, by, rome, in, 146, bce, or, with, the, final, defeat, of, the, last, remaining, successor, state, to, alexander, s, empire, after, the, battle, of, actium, in, 31, bce, which, also, marks, the, end, of, republican, rome, it, is, thus, much, longer, than, the, previous, periods, and, includes, at, least, two, major, phases, a, pergamene, style, of, experimentation, exuberance, and, some, sentimentality, and, vulgarity, and, in, the, 2nd, century, bce, a, classicising, return, to, a, more, austere, simplicity, and, elegance, beyond, such, generalizations, dating, is, typically, very, uncertain, especially, when, only, later, copies, are, known, as, is, usually, the, case, the, initial, pergamene, style, was, not, especially, associated, with, pergamon, from, which, it, takes, its, name, but, the, very, wealthy, kings, of, that, state, were, among, the, first, to, collect, and, also, copy, classical, sculpture, and, also, commissioned, much, new, work, including, the, famous, pergamon, altar, whose, sculpture, is, now, mostly, in, berlin, and, which, exemplifies, the, new, style, as, do, the, mausoleum, at, halicarnassus, another, of, the, seven, wonders, the, famous, laoco, n, and, his, sons, in, the, vatican, museums, a, late, example, and, the, bronze, original, of, the, dying, gaul, illustrated, at, top, which, we, know, was, part, of, a, group, actually, commissioned, for, pergamon, in, about, 228, bce, from, which, the, ludovisi, gaul, was, also, a, copy, the, group, called, the, farnese, bull, possibly, a, 2nd, century, marble, original, is, still, larger, and, more, complex, hellenistic, sculpture, greatly, expanded, the, range, of, subjects, represented, partly, as, a, result, of, greater, general, prosperity, and, the, emergence, of, a, very, wealthy, class, who, had, large, houses, decorated, with, sculpture, although, we, know, that, some, examples, of, subjects, that, seem, best, suited, to, the, home, such, as, children, with, animals, were, in, fact, placed, in, temples, or, other, public, places, for, a, much, more, popular, home, decoration, market, there, were, tanagra, figurines, and, those, from, other, centres, where, small, pottery, figures, were, produced, on, an, industrial, scale, some, religious, but, others, showing, animals, and, elegantly, dressed, ladies, sculptors, became, more, technically, skilled, in, representing, facial, expressions, conveying, a, wide, variety, of, emotions, and, the, portraiture, of, individuals, as, well, representing, different, ages, and, races, the, reliefs, from, the, mausoleum, are, rather, atypical, in, that, respect, most, work, was, free, standing, and, group, compositions, with, several, figures, to, be, seen, in, the, round, like, the, laocoon, and, the, pergamon, group, celebrating, victory, over, the, gauls, became, popular, having, been, rare, before, the, barberini, faun, showing, a, satyr, sprawled, asleep, presumably, after, drink, is, an, example, of, the, moral, relaxation, of, the, period, and, the, readiness, to, create, large, and, expensive, sculptures, of, subjects, that, fall, short, of, the, heroic, after, the, conquests, of, alexander, hellenistic, culture, was, dominant, in, the, courts, of, most, of, the, near, east, and, some, of, central, asia, and, increasingly, being, adopted, by, european, elites, especially, in, italy, where, greek, colonies, initially, controlled, most, of, the, south, hellenistic, art, and, artists, spread, very, widely, and, was, especially, influential, in, the, expanding, roman, republic, and, when, it, encountered, buddhism, in, the, easternmost, extensions, of, the, hellenistic, area, the, massive, so, called, alexander, sarcophagus, found, in, sidon, in, modern, lebanon, was, probably, made, there, at, the, start, of, the, period, by, expatriate, greek, artists, for, a, hellenized, persian, governor, the, wealth, of, the, period, led, to, a, greatly, increased, production, of, luxury, forms, of, small, sculpture, including, engraved, gems, and, cameos, jewellery, and, gold, and, silverware, early, roman, art, was, influenced, by, the, art, of, greece, and, that, of, the, neighbouring, etruscans, themselves, greatly, influenced, by, their, greek, trading, partners, an, etruscan, speciality, was, near, life, size, tomb, effigies, in, terracotta, usually, lying, on, top, of, a, sarcophagus, lid, propped, up, on, one, elbow, in, the, pose, of, a, diner, in, that, period, as, the, expanding, roman, republic, began, to, conquer, greek, territory, at, first, in, southern, italy, and, then, the, entire, hellenistic, world, except, for, the, parthian, far, east, official, and, patrician, sculpture, became, largely, an, extension, of, the, hellenistic, style, from, which, specifically, roman, elements, are, hard, to, disentangle, especially, as, so, much, greek, sculpture, survives, only, in, copies, of, the, roman, period, by, the, 2nd, century, bce, most, of, the, sculptors, working, at, rome, were, greek, often, enslaved, in, conquests, such, as, that, of, corinth, 146, bce, and, sculptors, continued, to, be, mostly, greeks, often, slaves, whose, names, are, very, rarely, recorded, vast, numbers, of, greek, statues, were, imported, to, rome, whether, as, booty, or, the, result, of, extortion, or, commerce, and, temples, were, often, decorated, with, re, used, greek, works, a, native, italian, style, can, be, seen, in, the, tomb, monuments, which, very, often, featured, portrait, busts, of, prosperous, middle, class, romans, and, portraiture, is, arguably, the, main, strength, of, roman, sculpture, there, are, no, survivals, from, the, tradition, of, masks, of, ancestors, that, were, worn, in, processions, at, the, funerals, of, the, great, families, and, otherwise, displayed, in, the, home, but, many, of, the, busts, that, survive, must, represent, ancestral, figures, perhaps, from, the, large, family, tombs, like, the, tomb, of, the, scipios, or, the, later, mausolea, outside, the, city, the, famous, bronze, head, supposedly, of, lucius, junius, brutus, is, very, variously, dated, but, taken, as, a, very, rare, survival, of, italic, style, under, the, republic, in, the, preferred, medium, of, bronze, similarly, stern, and, forceful, heads, are, seen, on, coins, of, the, late, republic, and, in, the, imperial, period, coins, as, well, as, busts, sent, around, the, empire, to, be, placed, in, the, basilicas, of, provincial, cities, were, the, main, visual, form, of, imperial, propaganda, even, londinium, had, a, near, colossal, statue, of, nero, though, far, smaller, than, the, 30, metre, high, colossus, of, nero, in, rome, now, lost, the, romans, did, not, generally, attempt, to, compete, with, free, standing, greek, works, of, heroic, exploits, from, history, or, mythology, but, from, early, on, produced, historical, works, in, relief, culminating, in, the, great, roman, triumphal, columns, with, continuous, narrative, reliefs, winding, around, them, of, which, those, commemorating, trajan, ce, 113, and, marcus, aurelius, by, 193, survive, in, rome, where, the, ara, pacis, altar, of, peace, 13, bce, represents, the, official, greco, roman, style, at, its, most, classical, and, refined, among, other, major, examples, are, the, earlier, re, used, reliefs, on, the, arch, of, constantine, and, the, base, of, the, column, of, antoninus, pius, 161, campana, reliefs, were, cheaper, pottery, versions, of, marble, reliefs, and, the, taste, for, relief, was, from, the, imperial, period, expanded, to, the, sarcophagus, all, forms, of, luxury, small, sculpture, continued, to, be, patronized, and, quality, could, be, extremely, high, as, in, the, silver, warren, cup, glass, lycurgus, cup, and, large, cameos, like, the, gemma, augustea, gonzaga, cameo, and, the, great, cameo, of, france, for, a, much, wider, section, of, the, population, moulded, relief, decoration, of, pottery, vessels, and, small, figurines, were, produced, in, great, quantity, and, often, considerable, quality, after, moving, through, a, late, 2nd, century, baroque, phase, in, the, 3rd, century, roman, art, largely, abandoned, or, simply, became, unable, to, produce, sculpture, in, the, classical, tradition, a, change, whose, causes, remain, much, discussed, even, the, most, important, imperial, monuments, now, showed, stumpy, large, eyed, figures, in, a, harsh, frontal, style, in, simple, compositions, emphasizing, power, at, the, expense, of, grace, the, contrast, is, famously, illustrated, in, the, arch, of, constantine, of, 315, in, rome, which, combines, sections, in, the, new, style, with, roundels, in, the, earlier, full, greco, roman, style, taken, from, elsewhere, and, the, four, tetrarchs, c, 305, from, the, new, capital, of, constantinople, now, in, venice, ernst, kitzinger, found, in, both, monuments, the, same, stubby, proportions, angular, movements, an, ordering, of, parts, through, symmetry, and, repetition, and, a, rendering, of, features, and, drapery, folds, through, incisions, rather, than, modelling, the, hallmark, of, the, style, wherever, it, appears, consists, of, an, emphatic, hardness, heaviness, and, angularity, in, short, an, almost, complete, rejection, of, the, classical, tradition, this, revolution, in, style, shortly, preceded, the, period, in, which, christianity, was, adopted, by, the, roman, state, and, the, great, majority, of, the, people, leading, to, the, end, of, large, religious, sculpture, with, large, statues, now, only, used, for, emperors, however, rich, christians, continued, to, commission, reliefs, for, sarcophagi, as, in, the, sarcophagus, of, junius, bassus, and, very, small, sculpture, especially, in, ivory, was, continued, by, christians, building, on, the, style, of, the, consular, diptych, the, early, christians, were, opposed, to, monumental, religious, sculpture, though, continuing, roman, traditions, in, portrait, busts, and, sarcophagus, reliefs, as, well, as, smaller, objects, such, as, the, consular, diptych, such, objects, often, in, valuable, materials, were, also, the, main, sculptural, traditions, as, far, as, is, known, of, the, barbaric, civilizations, of, the, migration, period, as, seen, in, the, objects, found, in, the, 6th, century, burial, treasure, at, sutton, hoo, and, the, jewellery, of, scythian, art, and, the, hybrid, christian, and, animal, style, productions, of, insular, art, following, the, continuing, byzantine, tradition, carolingian, art, revived, ivory, carving, often, in, panels, for, the, treasure, bindings, of, grand, illuminated, manuscripts, as, well, as, crozier, heads, and, other, small, fittings, byzantine, art, though, producing, superb, ivory, reliefs, and, architectural, decorative, carving, never, returned, to, monumental, sculpture, or, even, much, small, sculpture, in, the, round, however, in, the, west, during, the, carolingian, and, ottonian, periods, there, was, the, beginnings, of, a, production, of, monumental, statues, in, courts, and, major, churches, this, gradually, spread, by, the, late, 10th, and, 11th, century, there, are, records, of, several, apparently, life, size, sculptures, in, anglo, saxon, churches, probably, of, precious, metal, around, a, wooden, frame, like, the, golden, madonna, of, essen, no, anglo, saxon, example, has, survived, and, survivals, of, large, non, architectural, sculpture, from, before, 1, 000, are, exceptionally, rare, much, the, finest, is, the, gero, cross, of, 965, 970, which, is, a, crucifix, which, was, evidently, the, commonest, type, of, sculpture, charlemagne, had, set, one, up, in, the, palatine, chapel, in, aachen, around, 800, these, continued, to, grow, in, popularity, especially, in, germany, and, italy, the, runestones, of, the, nordic, world, the, pictish, stones, of, scotland, and, possibly, the, high, cross, reliefs, of, christian, great, britain, were, northern, sculptural, traditions, that, bridged, the, period, of, christianization, beginning, in, roughly, 1000, a, d, there, was, a, rebirth, of, artistic, production, in, all, europe, led, by, general, economic, growth, in, production, and, commerce, and, the, new, style, of, romanesque, art, was, the, first, medieval, style, to, be, used, in, the, whole, of, western, europe, the, new, cathedrals, and, pilgrim, s, churches, were, increasingly, decorated, with, architectural, stone, reliefs, and, new, focuses, for, sculpture, developed, such, as, the, tympanum, over, church, doors, in, the,

statues, of, the, enthroned, madonna, but, the, high, relief, was, above, all, the, sculptural, mode, of, the, period, compositions, usually, had, little, depth, and, needed, to, be, flexible, to, squeeze, themselves, into, the, shapes, of, capitals, and, church, typanums, the, tension, between, a, tightly, enclosing, frame, from, which, the, composition, sometimes, escapes, is, a, recurrent,

defined, by, gothic, architecture, and, does, not, entirely, fit, with, the, development, of, style, in, sculpture, in, either, its, start, or, finish, the, facades, of, large, churches, especially, around, doors, continued, to, have, large, typanums, but, also, rows, of, sculpted, figures, spreading, around, them, the, statues, on, the, western, royal, portal, at, chartres, cathedral, c, 1145, show, an, elegant, but, exaggerated, columnar, elongation, but, those, on, the, south, transept, portal, from, 1215, to, 1220, show, a, more, naturalistic, style, and, increasing, detachment, from, the, wall, behind, and, some, awareness, of, the, classical, tradition, these, trends, were, continued, in, the, west, portal, at, reims, cathedral, of, a, few, years, later, where, the, figures, are, almost, in, the, round, as, became, usual, as, gothic, spread, across, europe, in, italy, nicola, pisano, 1258, 1278, and, his, son, giovanni, developed, a, style, that, is, often, called, proto, renaissance, with, unmistakable, influence, from, roman, sarcophagi, and, sophisticated, and, crowded, compositions, including, a, sympathetic, handling, of, nudity, in, relief, panels, on, their, siena, cathedral, pulpit, 1265, 68, pulpit, in, the, pisa, baptistery, 1260, the, fontana, maggiore, in, perugia, and, giovanni, s, pulpit, in, pistoia, of, 1301, another, revival, of, classical, style, is, seen, in, the, international, gothic, work, of, claus, sluter, and, his, followers, in, burgundy, and, flanders, around, 1400, late, gothic, sculpture, continued, in, the, north, with, a, fashion, for, very, large, wooden, sculpted, altarpieces, with, increasingly, virtuoso, carving, and, large, numbers, agitated, expressive, figures, most, surviving, examples, are, in, germany, after, much, iconoclasm, elsewhere, tilman, riemenschneider, veit, stoss, and, others, continued, the, style, well, into, the, 16th, century, gradually, absorbing, italian, renaissance, influences, life,

moved, outside, the, church, by, the, 15th, century, there, was, an, industry, exporting, nottingham, alabaster, altar, reliefs, in, groups, of, panels, over, much, of, europe, for, economical, parishes, who, could, not, afford, stone, retables, small, carvings, for, a, mainly, lay, and, often, female, market, became, a, considerable, industry, in, paris, and, some, other, centres, types, of, ivories, included, small, devotional, polyptychs, single, figures, especially, of, the, virgin, mirror, cases, combs, and, elaborate, caskets, with, scenes, from, romances, used, as, engagement, presents, the, very, wealthy, collected, extravagantly, elaborate, jewelled, and, enamelled, metalwork, both, secular, and, religious, like, the, duc, de, berry, s, holy, thorn, reliquary, until, they, ran, short, of, money, when, they, were, melted, down, again, for, cash, renaissance, sculpture, proper, is, often, taken, to, begin, with, the, famous, competition, for, the, doors, of, the, florence, baptistry, in, 1403, from, which, the, trial, models, submitted, by, the, winner, lorenzo, ghiberti, and, filippo, brunelleschi, survive, ghiberti, s, doors, are, still, in, place, but, were, undoubtedly, eclipsed, by, his, second, pair, for, the, other, entrance, the, so, called, gates, of, paradise, which, took, him, from, 1425, to, 1452, and, are, dazzlingly, confident, classicizing, compositions, with, varied, depths, of, relief, allowing, extensive, backgrounds, the, intervening, years, had, seen, ghiberti, s, early, assistant, donatello, develop, with, seminal, statues, including, his, davids, in, marble, 1408, 09, and, bronze, 1440s, and, his, equestrian, statue, of, gattamelata, as, well, as, reliefs, a, leading, figure, in, the, later, period, was, andrea, del, verrocchio, best, known, for, his, equestrian, statue, of, bartolomeo, colleoni, in, venice, his, pupil, leonardo, da, vinci, designed, an, equine, sculpture, in, 1482, the, horse, for, milan, but, only, succeeded, in, making, a, 24, foot, 7, 3, m, clay, model, which, was, destroyed, by, french, archers, in, 1499, and, his, other, ambitious, sculptural, plans, were, never, completed, the, period, was, marked, by, a, great, increase, in, patronage, of, sculpture, by, the, state, for, public, art, and, by, the, wealthy, for, their, homes, especially, in, italy, public, sculpture, remains, a, crucial, element, in, the, appearance, of, historic, city, centres, church, sculpture, mostly, moved, inside, just, as, outside, public, monuments, became, common, portrait, sculpture, usually, in, busts, became, popular, in, italy, around, 1450, with, the, neapolitan, francesco, laurana, specializing, in, young, women, in, meditative, poses, while, antonio, rossellino, and, others, more, often, depicted, knobbly, faced, men, of, affairs, but, also, young, children, the, portrait, medal, invented, by, pisanello, also, often, depicted, women, relief, plaquettes, were, another, new, small, form, of, sculpture, in, cast, metal, michelangelo, was, an, active, sculptor, from, about, 1500, to, 1520, and, his, great, masterpieces, including, his, david, piet, moses, and, pieces, for, the, tomb, of, pope, julius, ii, and, medici, chapel, could, not, be, ignored, by, subsequent, sculptors, his, iconic, david, 1504, has, a, contrapposto, pose, borrowed, from, classical, sculpture, it, differs, from, previous, representations, of, the, subject, in, that, david, is, depicted, before, his, battle, with, goliath, and, not, after, the, giant, s, defeat, instead, of, being, shown, victorious, as, donatello, and, verocchio, had, done, david, looks, tense, and, battle, ready, as, in, painting, early, italian, mannerist, sculpture, was, very, largely, an, attempt, to, find, an, original, style, that, would, top, the, achievement, of, the, high, renaissance, which, in, sculpture, essentially, meant, michelangelo, and, much, of, the, struggle, to, achieve, this, was, played, out, in, commissions, to, fill, other, places, in, the, piazza, della, signoria, in, florence, next, to, michelangelo, s, david, baccio, bandinelli, took, over, the, project, of, hercules, and, cacus, from, the, master, himself, but, it, was, little, more, popular, than, it, is, now, and, maliciously, compared, by, benvenuto, cellini, to, a, sack, of, melons, though, it, had, a, long, lasting, effect, in, apparently, introducing, relief, panels, on, the, pedestal, of, statues, for, the, first, time, like, other, works, of, his, and, other, mannerists, it, removes, far, more, of, the, original, block, than, michelangelo, would, have, done, cellini, s, bronze, perseus, with, the, head, of, medusa, is, certainly, a, masterpiece, designed, with, eight, angles, of, view, another, mannerist, characteristic, but, is, indeed, mannered, compared, to, the, david, s, of, michelangelo, and, donatello, originally, a, goldsmith, his, famous, gold, and, enamel, salt, cellar, 1543, was, his, first, sculpture, and, shows, his, talent, at, its, best, as, these, examples, show, the, period, extended, the, range, of, secular, subjects, for, large, works, beyond, portraits, with, mythological, figures, especially, favoured, previously, these, had, mostly, been, found, in, small, works, small, bronze, figures, for, collector, s, cabinets, often, mythological, subjects, with, nudes, were, a, popular, renaissance, form, at, which, giambologna, originally, flemish, but, based, in, florence, excelled, in, the, later, part, of, the, century, also, creating, life, size, sculptures, of, which, two, joined, the, collection, in, the, piazza, della, signoria, he, and, his, followers, devised, elegant, elongated, examples, of, the, figura, serpentinata, often, of, two, intertwined, figures, that, were, interesting, from, all, angles, in, baroque, sculpture, groups, of, figures, assumed, new, importance, and, there, was, a, dynamic, movement, and, energy, of, human, forms, they, spiralled, around, an, empty, central, vortex, or, reached, outwards, into, the, surrounding, space, baroque, sculpture, often, had, multiple, ideal, viewing, angles, and, reflected, a, general, continuation, of, the, renaissance, move, away, from, the, relief, to, sculpture, created, in, the, round, and, designed, to, be, placed, in, the, middle, of, a, large, space, elaborate, fountains, such, as, bernini, s, fontana, dei, quattro, fiumi, rome, 1651, or, those, in, the, gardens, of, versailles, were, a, baroque, speciality, the, baroque, style, was, perfectly, suited, to, sculpture, with, gian, lorenzo, bernini, the, dominating, figure, of, the, age, in, works, such, as, the, ecstasy, of, st, theresa, 1647, 1652, much, baroque, sculpture, added, extra, sculptural, elements, for, example, concealed, lighting, or, water, fountains, or, fused, sculpture, and, architecture, to, create, a, transformative, experience, for, the, viewer, artists, saw, themselves, as, in, the, classical, tradition, but, admired, hellenistic, and, later, roman, sculpture, rather, than, that, of, the, more, classical, periods, as, they, are, seen, today, the, protestant, reformation, brought, an, almost, total, stop, to, religious, sculpture, in, much, of, northern, europe, and, though, secular, sculpture, especially, for, portrait, busts, and, tomb, monuments, continued, the, dutch, golden, age, has, no, significant, sculptural, component, outside, goldsmithing, partly, in, direct, reaction, sculpture, was, as, prominent, in, roman, catholicism, as, in, the, late, middle, ages, statues, of, rulers, and, the, nobility, became, increasingly, popular, in, the, 18th, century, much, sculpture, continued, on, baroque, lines, the, trevi, fountain, was, only, completed, in, 1762, rococo, style, was, better, suited, to, smaller, works, and, arguably, found, its, ideal, sculptural, form, in, early, european, porcelain, and, interior, decorative, schemes, in, wood, or, plaster, such, as, those, in, french, domestic, interiors, and, austrian, and, bavarian, pilgrimage, churches, the, neoclassical, style, that, arrived, in, the, late, 18th, century, gave, great, emphasis, to, sculpture, jean, antoine, houdon, exemplifies, the, penetrating, portrait, sculpture, the, style, could, produce, and, antonio, canova, s, nudes, the, idealist, aspect, of, the, movement, the, neoclassical, period, was, one, of, the, great, ages, of, public, sculpture, though, its, classical, prototypes, were, more, likely, to, be, roman, copies, of, hellenistic, sculptures, in, sculpture, the, most, familiar, representatives, are, the, italian, antonio, canova, the, englishman, john, flaxman, and, the, dane, bertel, thorvaldsen, the, european, neoclassical, manner, also, took, hold, in, the, united, states, where, its, pinnacle, occurred, somewhat, later, and, is, exemplified, in, the, sculptures, of, hiram, powers, greco, buddhist, art, is, the, artistic, manifestation, of, greco, buddhism, a, cultural, syncretism, between, the, classical, greek, culture, and, buddhism, which, developed, over, a, period, of, close, to, 1000, years, in, central, asia, between, the, conquests, of, alexander, the, great, in, the, 4th, century, bce, and, the, islamic, conquests, of, the, 7th, century, ce, greco, buddhist, art, is, characterized, by, the, strong, idealistic, realism, of, hellenistic, art, and, the, first, representations, of, the, buddha, in, human, form, which, have, helped, define, the, artistic, and, particularly, sculptural, canon, for, buddhist, art, throughout, the, asian, continent, up, to, the, present, though, dating, is, uncertain, it, appears, that, strongly, hellenistic, styles, lingered, in, the, east, for, several, centuries, after, they, had, declined, around, the, mediterranean, as, late, as, the, 5th, century, ce, some, aspects, of, greek, art, were, adopted, while, others, did, not, spread, beyond, the, greco, buddhist, area, in, particular, the, standing, figure, often, with, a, relaxed, pose, and, one, leg, flexed, and, the, flying, cupids, or, victories, who, became, popular, across, asia, as, apsaras, greek, foliage, decoration, was, also, influential, with, indian, versions, of, the, corinthian, capital, appearing, the, origins, of, greco, buddhist, art, are, to, be, found, in, the, hellenistic, greco, bactrian, kingdom, 250, 130, bce, located, in, today, s, afghanistan, from, which, hellenistic, culture, radiated, into, the, indian, subcontinent, with, the, establishment, of,

all, sorts, of, objects, especially, in, metalwork, and, jade, in, the, earlier, periods, large, quantities, of, sculpture, were, cut, from, the, living, rock, in, pilgrimage, cave, complexes, and, as, outside, rock, reliefs, these, were, mostly, originally, painted, in, notable, contrast, to, literati, painters, sculptors, of, all, sorts, were, regarded, as, artisans, and, very, few, names, are, recorded, from, the, ming, dynasty, onwards, statuettes, of, religious, and, secular, figures, were, produced, in, chinese, porcelain, and, other, media, which, became, an, important, export, towards, the, end, of, the, long, neolithic, j, mon, period, some, pottery, vessels, were, flame, rimmed, with, extravagant, extensions, to, the, rim, that, can, only, be, called, sculptural, and, very, stylized, pottery, dog, figures, were, produced, many, with, the, characteristic, snow, goggle, eyes, during, the, kofun, period, of, the, 3rd, to, 6th, century, ce, haniwa, terracotta, figures, of, humans, and, animals, in, a, simplistic, style, were, erected, outside, important, tombs, the, arrival, of, buddhism, in, the, 6th, century, brought, with, it, sophisticated, traditions, in,

including, a, shaka, trinity, of, 623, in, bronze, showing, the, historical, buddha, flanked, by, two, bodhisattvas, and, also, the, guardian, kings, of, the, four, directions, j, ch, is, said, to, be, one, of, the, greatest, buddhist, sculptors, not, only, in, heian, period, but, also, in, the, history, of, buddhist, statues, in, japan, j, ch, redefined, the, body, shape, of, buddha, statues, by, perfecting, the, technique, of, yosegi, zukuri, which, is, a, combination, of, several, woods, the, peaceful, expression, and, graceful, figure, of, the, buddha, statue, that, he, made, completed, a, japanese, style, of, sculpture, of, buddha, statues, called, j, ch, y, j, ch, style, and, determined, the, style, of, japanese, buddhist, statues, of, the, later, period, his, achievement, dramatically, raised, the, social, status, of, busshi, buddhist, sculptor, in, japan, in, the, kamakura, period, the, minamoto, clan, established, the, kamakura, shogunate, and, the, samurai, class, virtually, ruled, japan, for, the, first, time, jocho, s, successors, sculptors, of, the, kei, school, of, buddhist, statues, created, realistic, and, dynamic, statues, to, suit, the, tastes, of, samurai, and, japanese, buddhist, sculpture, reached, its, peak, unkei, kaikei, and, tankei, were, famous, and, they, made, many, new, buddha, statues, at, many, temples, such, as, kofuku, ji, where, many, buddha, statues, had, been, lost, in, wars, and, fires, almost, all, subsequent, significant, large, sculpture, in, japan, was, buddhist, with, some, shinto, equivalents, and, after, buddhism, declined, in, japan, in, the, 15th, century, monumental, sculpture, became, largely, architectural, decoration, and, less, significant, however, sculptural, work, in, the, decorative, arts, was, developed, to, a, remarkable, level, of, technical, achievement, and, refinement, in, small, objects, such, as, inro, and, netsuke, in, many, materials, and, metal, tosogu, or, japanese, sword, mountings, in, the, 19th, century, there, were, export, industries, of, small, bronze, sculptures, of, extreme, virtuosity, ivory, and, porcelain, figurines, and, other, types, of, small, sculpture, increasingly, emphasizing, technical, accomplishment, the, first, known, sculpture, in, the, indian, subcontinent, is, from, the, indus, valley, civilization, 3300, 1700, bce, found, in, sites, at, mohenjo, daro, and, harappa, in, modern, day, pakistan, these, include, the, famous, small, bronze, female, dancer, and, the, so, called, priest, king, however, such, figures, in, bronze, and, stone, are, rare, and, greatly, outnumbered, by, pottery, figurines, and, stone, seals, often, of, animals, or, deities, very, finely, depicted, after, the, collapse, of, the, indus, valley, civilization, there, is, little, record, of, sculpture, until, the, buddhist, era, apart, from, a, hoard, of, copper, figures, of, somewhat, controversially, c, 1500, bce, from, daimabad, thus, the, great, tradition, of, indian, monumental, sculpture, in, stone, appears, to, begin, relative, to, other, cultures, and, the, development, of, indian, civilization, relatively, late, with, the, reign, of, asoka, from, 270, to, 232, bce, and, the, pillars, of, ashoka, he, erected, around, india, carrying, his, edicts, and, topped, by, famous, sculptures, of, animals, mostly, lions, of, which, six, survive, large, amounts, of, figurative, sculpture, mostly, in, relief, survive, from, early, buddhist, pilgrimage, stupas, above, all, sanchi, these, probably, developed, out, of, a, tradition, using, wood, that, also, embraced, hinduism, the, pink, sandstone, hindu, jain, and, buddhist, sculptures, of, mathura, from, the, 1st, to, 3rd, centuries, ce, reflected, both, native, indian, traditions, and, the, western, influences, received, through, the, greco, buddhist, art, of, gandhara, and, effectively, established, the, basis, for, subsequent, indian, religious, sculpture, the, style, was, developed, and, diffused, through, most, of, india, under, the, gupta, empire, c, 320, 550, which, remains, a, classical, period, for, indian, sculpture, covering, the, earlier, ellora, caves, though, the, elephanta, caves, are, probably, slightly, later, later, large, scale, sculpture, remains, almost, exclusively, religious, and, generally, rather, conservative, often, reverting, to, simple, frontal, standing, poses, for, deities, though, the, attendant, spirits, such, as, apsaras, and, yakshi, often, have, sensuously, curving, poses, carving, is, often, highly, detailed, with, an, intricate, backing, behind, the, main, figure, in, high, relief, the, celebrated, bronzes, of, the, chola, dynasty, c, 850, 1250, from, south, india, many, designed, to, be, carried, in, processions, include, the, iconic, form, of, shiva, as, nataraja, with, the, massive, granite, carvings, of, mahabalipuram, dating, from, the, previous, pallava, dynasty, the, sculpture, of, the, region, tends, to, be, characterised, by, a, high, degree, of, ornamentation, as, seen, in, the, great, monuments, of, hindu, and, buddhist, khmer, sculpture, 9th, to, 13th, centuries, at, angkor, wat, and, elsewhere, the, enormous, 9th, century, buddhist, complex, at, borobudur, in, java, and, the, hindu, monuments, of, bali, both, of, these, include, many, reliefs, as, well, as, figures, in,

islamic, sculptures, from, the, philippines, have, different, motifs, compared, to, other, christian, and, islamic, sculptures, elsewhere, in, later, periods, chinese, influence, predominated, in, vietnam, laos, and, cambodia, and, more, wooden, sculpture, survives, from, across, the, region, islam, is, famously, aniconic, so, the, vast, majority, of, sculpture, is, arabesque, decoration, in, relief, or, openwork, based, on, vegetable, motifs, but, tending, to, geometrical, abstract, forms, in, the, very, early, mshatta, facade, 740s, now, mostly, in, berlin, there, are, animals, within, the, dense, arabesques, in, high, relief, and, figures, of, animals, and, men, in, mostly, low, relief, are, found, in, conjunction, with, decoration, on, many, later, pieces, in, various, materials, including, metalwork, ivory, and, ceramics, figures, of, animals, in, the, round, were, often, acceptable, for, works, used, in, private, contexts, if, the, object, was, clearly, practical, so, medieval, islamic, art, contains, many, metal, animals, that, are, aquamaniles, incense, burners, or, supporters, for, fountains, as, in, the, stone, lions, supporting, the, famous, one, in, the, alhambra, culminating, in, the, largest, medieval, islamic, animal, figure, known, the, pisa, griffin, in, the, same, way, luxury, hardstone, carvings, such, as, dagger, hilts, and, cups, may, be, formed, as, animals, especially, in, mughal, art, the, degree, of, acceptability, of, such, relaxations, of, strict, islamic, rules, varies, between, periods, and, regions, with, islamic, spain, persia, and, india, often, leading, relaxation, and, is, typically, highest, in, courtly, contexts, historically, with, the, exception, of, some, monumental, egyptian, sculpture, most, african,

areas, masks, are, important, elements, in, the, art, of, many, peoples, along, with, human, figures, often, highly, stylized, there, is, a, vast, variety, of, styles, often, varying, within, the, same, context, of, origin, depending, on, the, use, of, the, object, but, wide, regional, trends, are, apparent, sculpture, is, most, common, among, groups, of, settled, cultivators, in, the, areas, drained, by, the, niger, and, congo, rivers, in, west, africa, direct, images, of, deities, are, relatively, infrequent, but, masks, in, particular, are, or, were, often, made, for, religious, ceremonies, today, many, are, made, for, tourists, as, airport, art, african, masks, were, an, influence, on, european, modernist, art, which, was, inspired, by, their, lack, of, concern, for, naturalistic, depiction, the, nubian, kingdom, of, kush, in, modern, sudan, was, in, close, and, often, hostile, contact, with, egypt, and, produced, monumental, sculpture, mostly, derivative, of, styles, to, the, north, in, west, africa, the, earliest, known, sculptures, are, from, the, nok, culture, which, thrived, between, 500, bce, and, 500, ce, in, modern, nigeria, with, clay, figures, typically, with, elongated, bodies, and, angular, shapes, later, west, african, cultures, developed, bronze, casting, for, reliefs, to, decorate, palaces, like, the, famous, benin, bronzes, and, very, fine, naturalistic, royal, heads, from, around, the, yoruba, town, of, ife, in, terracotta, and, metal, from, the, 12th, 14th, centuries, akan, goldweights, are, a, form, of, small, metal, sculptures,

sculptured, elements, many, west, african, figures, are, used, in, religious, rituals, and, are, often, coated, with, materials, placed, on, them, for, ceremonial, offerings, the, mande, speaking, peoples, of, the, same, region, make, pieces, of, wood, with, broad, flat, surfaces, and, arms, and, legs, are, shaped, like, cylinders, in, central, africa, however, the, main, distinguishing, characteristics, include, heart, shaped, faces, that, are, curved, inward, and, display, patterns, of, circles, and, dots, populations, in, the, african, great, lakes, are, not, known, for, their, sculpture, however, one, style, from, the, region, is, pole, sculptures, carved, in, human, shapes, and, decorated, with, geometric, forms, while, the, tops, are, carved, with, figures, of, animals, people, and, various, objects, these, poles, are, then, placed, next, to, graves, and, are, associated, with, death, and, the, ancestral, world, the, culture, known, from, great, zimbabwe, left, more, impressive, buildings, than, sculpture, but, the, eight, soapstone, zimbabwe, birds, appear, to, have, had, a, special, significance, and, were, mounted, on, monoliths, modern, zimbabwean, sculptors, in, soapstone, have, achieved, considerable, international, success, southern, africa, s, oldest, known, clay, figures, date, from, 400, to, 600, ce, and, have, cylindrical, heads, with, a, mixture, of, human, and, animal, features, the, creation, of, sculptures, in, ethiopia, and, eritrea, can, be, traced, back, to, its, ancient, past, with, the, kingdoms, of, d, mt, and, aksum, christian, art, was, established, in, ethiopia, with, the, conversion, from, paganism, to, christianity, in, the, 4th, century, ce, during, the, reign, of, king, ezana, of, axum, christian, imagery, decorated, churches, during, the, asksumite, period, and, later, eras, for, instance, at, lalibela, life, size, saints, were, carved, into, the, church, of, bet, golgotha, by, tradition, these, were, made, during, the, reign, of, the, zagwe, ruler, gebre, mesqel, lalibela, in, the, 12th, century, but, they, were, more, likely, crafted, in, the, 15th, century, during, the, solomonic, dynasty, however, the, church, of, saint, george, lalibela, one, of, several, examples, of, rock, cut, architecture, at, lalibela, containing, intricate, carvings, was, built, in, the, 10th, 13th, centuries, as, proven, by, archaeology, in, ancient, sudan, the, development, of, sculpture, stretches, from, the, simple, pottery, of, the, kerma, culture, beginning, around, 2500, bce, to, the, monumental, statuary, and, architecture, of, the, kingdom, of, kush, its, last, phase, the, meroitic, period, ending, around, 350, ce, with, its, conquest, by, ethiopia, s, aksum, beyond, pottery, items, the, kerma, culture, also, made, furniture, that, contained, sculptures, such, as, gold, cattle, hoofs, as, the, legs, of, beds, sculpture, during, the, kingdom, of, kush, included, full, sized, statues, especially, of, kings, and, queens, smaller, figurines, most, commonly, depicting, royal, servants, and, reliefs, in, stone, which, were, influenced, by, the, contemporary, ancient, egyptian, sculptural, tradition, sculpture, in, present, day, latin, america, developed, in, two, separate, and, distinct, areas, mesoamerica, in, the, north, and, peru, in, the, south, in, both, areas, sculpture, was, initially, of, stone, and, later, of, terracotta, and, metal, as, the, civilizations, in, these, areas, became, more, technologically, proficient, the, mesoamerican, region, produced, more, monumental, sculpture, from, the, massive, block, like, works, of, the, olmec, and, toltec, cultures, to, the, superb, low, reliefs, that, characterize, the, mayan, and, aztec, cultures, in, the, andean, region, sculptures, were, typically, small, but, often, show, superb, skill, in, north, america, wood, was, sculpted, for, totem, poles, masks, utensils, war, canoes, and, a, variety, of, other, uses, with, distinct, variation, between, different, cultures, and, regions, the, most, developed, styles, are, those, of, the, pacific, northwest, coast, where, a, group, of, elaborate, and, highly, stylized, formal, styles, developed, forming, the, basis, of, a, tradition, that, continues, today, in, addition, to, the, famous, totem, poles, painted, and, carved, house, fronts, were, complemented, by, carved, posts, inside, and, out, as, well, as, mortuary, figures, and, other, items, among, the, inuit, of, the, far, north, traditional, carving, styles, in, ivory, and, soapstone, are, still, continued, the, arrival, of, european, catholic, culture, readily, adapted, local, skills, to, the, prevailing, baroque, style, producing, enormously, elaborate, retablos, and, other, mostly, church, sculptures, in, a, variety, of, hybrid, styles, the, most, famous, of, such, examples, in, canada, is, the, altar, area, of, the, notre, dame, basilica, in, montreal, quebec, which, was, carved, by, peasant, habitant, labourers, later, artists, trained, in, the, western, academic, tradition, followed, european, styles, until, in, the, late, 19th, century, they, began, to, draw, again, on, indigenous, influences, notably, in, the, mexican, baroque, grotesque, style, known, as, churrigueresque, aboriginal, peoples, also, adapted, church, sculpture, in, variations, on, carpenter, gothic, one, famous, example, is, the, church, of, the, holy, cross, in, skookumchuck, hot, springs, british, columbia, the, history, of, sculpture, in, the, united, states, after, europeans, arrival, reflects, the, country, s, 18th, century, foundation, in, roman, republican, civic, values, and, protestant, christianity, compared, to, areas, colonized, by, the, spanish, sculpture, got, off, to, an, extremely, slow, start, in, the, british, colonies, with, next, to, no, place, in, churches, and, was, only, given, impetus, by, the, need, to, assert, nationality, after, independence, american, sculpture, of, the, mid, to, late, 19th, century, was, often, classical, often, romantic, but, showed, a, bent, for, a, dramatic, narrative, almost, journalistic, realism, public, buildings, during, the, last, quarter, of, the, 19th, century, and, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, often, provided, an, architectural, setting, for, sculpture, especially, in, relief, by, the, 1930s, the, international, style, of, architecture, and, design, and, art, deco, characterized, by, the, work, of, paul, manship, and, lee, lawrie, and, others, became, popular, by, the, 1950s, traditional, sculpture, education, would, almost, be, completely, replaced, by, a, bauhaus, influenced, concern, for, abstract, design, minimalist, sculpture, replaced, the, figure, in, public, settings, and, architects, almost, completely, stopped, using, sculpture, in, or, on, their, designs, modern, sculptors, 21st, century, use, both, classical, and, abstract, inspired, designs, beginning, in, the, 1980s, there, was, a, swing, back, toward, figurative, public, sculpture, by, 2000, many, of, the, new, public, pieces, in, the, united, states, were, figurative, in, design, modern, classicism, contrasted, in, many, ways, with, the, classical, sculpture, of, the, 19th, century, which, was, characterized, by, commitments, to, naturalism, antoine, louis, barye, the, melodramatic, fran, ois, rude, sentimentality, jean, baptiste, carpeaux, or, a, kind, of, stately, grandiosity, lord, leighton, several, different, directions, in, the, classical, tradition, were, taken, as, the, century, turned, but, the, study, of, the, live, model, and, the, post, renaissance, tradition, was, still, fundamental, to, them, auguste, rodin, was, the, most, renowned, european, sculptor, of, the, early, 20th, century, he, is, often, considered, a, sculptural, impressionist, as, are, his, students, including, camille, claudel, and, hugo, rheinhold, attempting, to, model, of, a, fleeting, moment, of, ordinary, life, modern, classicism, showed, a, lesser, interest, in, naturalism, and, a, greater, interest, in, formal, stylization, greater, attention, was, paid, to, the, rhythms, of, volumes, and, spaces, as, well, as, greater, attention, to, the, contrasting, qualities, of, surface, open, closed, planar, broken, etc, while, less, attention, was, paid, to, story, telling, and, convincing, details, of, anatomy, or, costume, greater, attention, was, given, to, psychological, effect, than, to, physical, realism, and, influences, from, earlier, styles, worldwide, were, used, early, masters, of, modern, classicism, included, aristide, maillol, alexander, matveyev, joseph, bernard, antoine, bourdelle, georg, kolbe, libero, andreotti, gustav, vigeland, jan, stursa, constantin, br, ncu, i, as, the, century, progressed, modern, classicism, was, adopted, as, the, national, style, of, the, two, great, european, totalitarian, empires, nazi, germany, and, soviet, russia, who, co, opted, the, work, of, earlier, artists, such, as, kolbe, and, wilhelm, lehmbruck, in, germany, and, matveyev, in, russia, over, the, 70, years, of, the, ussr, new, generations, of, sculptors, were, trained, and, chosen, within, their, system, and, a, distinct, style, socialist, realism, developed, that, returned, to, the, 19th, century, s, emphasis, on, melodrama, and, naturalism, classical, training, was, rooted, out, of, art, education, in, western, europe, and, the, americas, by, 1970, and, the, classical, variants, of, the, 20th, century, were, marginalized, in, the, history, of, modernism, but, classicism, continued, as, the, foundation, of, art, education, in, the, soviet, academies, until, 1990, providing, a, foundation, for, expressive, figurative, art, throughout, eastern, europe, and, parts, of, the, middle, east, by, 2000, the, european, classical, tradition, retains, a, wide, appeal, to, the, public, but, awaits, an, educational, tradition, to, revive, its, contemporary, development, some, of, the, modern, classical, became, either, more, decorative, art, deco, paul, manship, jose, de, creeft, carl, milles, or, more, abstractly, stylized, or, more, expressive, and, gothic, anton, hanak, wilhelm, lehmbruck, ernst, barlach, arturo, martini, or, turned, more, to, the, renaissance, giacomo, manz, venanzo, crocetti, or, stayed, the, same, charles, despiau, marcel, gimond, modernist, sculpture, movements, include, cubism, geometric, abstraction, de, stijl, suprematism, constructivism, dadaism, surrealism, futurism, formalism, abstract, expressionism, pop, art, minimalism, land, art, and, installation, art, among, others, in, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, pablo, picasso, revolutionized, the, art, of, sculpture, when, he, began, creating, his, constructions, fashioned, by, combining, disparate, objects, and, materials, into, one, constructed, piece, of, sculpture, the, sculptural, equivalent, of, the, collage, in, two, dimensional, art, the, advent, of, surrealism, led, to, things, occasionally, being, described, as, sculpture, that, would, not, have, been, so, previously, such, as, involuntary, sculpture, in, several, senses, including, coulage, in, later, years, picasso, became, a, prolific, potter, leading, with, interest, in, historic, pottery, from, around, the, world, to, a, revival, of, ceramic, art, with, figures, such, as, george, e, ohr, and, subsequently, peter, voulkos, kenneth, price, and, robert, arneson, marcel, duchamp, originated, the, use, of, the, found, object, french, objet, trouv, or, readymade, with, pieces, such, as, fountain, 1917, similarly, the, work, of, constantin, br, ncu, i, at, the, beginning, of, the, century, paved, the, way, for, later, abstract, sculpture, in, revolt, against, the, naturalism, of, rodin, and, his, late, 19th, century, contemporaries, br, ncu, i, distilled, subjects, down, to, their, essences, as, illustrated, by, the, elegantly, refined, forms, of, his, bird, in, space, series, 1924, br, ncu, i, s, impact, with, his, vocabulary, of, reduction, and, abstraction, is, seen, throughout, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, and, exemplified, by, artists, such, as, gaston, lachaise, sir, jacob, epstein, henry, moore, alberto, giacometti, joan, mir, julio, gonz, lez, pablo, serrano, jacques, lipchitz, and, by, the, 1940s, abstract, sculpture, was, impacted, and, expanded, by, alexander, calder, len, lye, jean, tinguely, and, frederick, kiesler, who, were, pioneers, of, kinetic, art, modernist, sculptors, largely, missed, out, on, the, huge, boom, in, public, art, resulting, from, the, demand, for, war, memorials, for, the, two, world, wars, but, from, the, 1950s, the, public, and, commissioning, bodies, became, more, comfortable, with, modernist, sculpture, and, large, public, commissions, both, abstract, and, figurative, became, common, picasso, was, commissioned, to, make, a, maquette, for, a, huge, 50, foot, 15, m, high, public, sculpture, the, so, called, chicago, picasso, 1967, his, design, was, ambiguous, and, somewhat, controversial, and, what, the, figure, represents, is, not, clear, it, could, be, a, bird, a, horse, a, woman, or, a, totally, abstract, shape, during, the, late, 1950s, and, the, 1960s, abstract, sculptors, began, experimenting, with, a, wide, array, of, new, materials, and, different, approaches, to, creating, their, work, surrealist, imagery, anthropomorphic, abstraction, new, materials, and, combinations, of, new, energy, sources, and, varied, surfaces, and, objects, became, characteristic, of, much, new, modernist, sculpture, collaborative, projects, with, landscape, designers, architects, and, landscape, architects, expanded, the, outdoor, site, and, contextual, integration, artists, such, as, isamu, noguchi, david, smith, alexander, calder, jean, tinguely, richard, lippold, george, rickey, louise, bourgeois, philip, pavia, and, louise, nevelson, came, to, characterize, the, look, of, modern, sculpture, by, the, 1960s, abstract, expressionism, geometric, abstraction, and, minimalism, which, reduces, sculpture, to, its, most, essential, and, fundamental, features, predominated, some, works, of, the, period, are, the, cubi, works, of, david, smith, and, the, welded, steel, works, of, sir, anthony, caro, as, well, as, welded, sculpture, by, a, large, variety, of, sculptors, the, large, scale, work, of, john, chamberlain, and, environmental, installation, scale, works, by, mark, di, suvero, other, minimalists, include, tony, smith, donald, judd, robert, morris, anne, truitt, giacomo, benevelli, arnaldo, pomodoro, richard, serra, dan, flavin, carl, andre, and, john, safer, who, added, motion, and, monumentality, to, the, theme, of, purity, of, line, during, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, figurative, sculpture, by, modernist, artists, in, stylized, forms, was, made, by, artists, such, as, leonard, baskin, ernest, trova, george, segal, marisol, escobar, paul, thek, robert, graham, in, a, classic, articulated, style, and, fernando, botero, bringing, his, painting, s, oversized, figures, into, monumental, sculptures, site, specific, and, environmental, art, works, are, represented, by, artists, andy, goldsworthy, walter, de, maria, richard, long, richard, serra, robert, irwin, george, rickey, and, christo, and, jeanne, claude, led, contemporary, abstract, sculpture, in, new, directions, artists, created, environmental, sculpture, on, expansive, sites, in, the, land, art, in, the, american, west, group, of, projects, these, land, art, or, earth, art, environmental, scale, sculpture, works, exemplified, by, artists, such, as, robert, smithson, michael, heizer, james, turrell, roden, crater, eva, hesse, sol, lewitt, jackie, winsor, keith, sonnier, bruce, nauman, and, dennis, oppenheim, among, others, were, pioneers, of, postminimalist, sculpture, also, during, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, artists, as, diverse, as, eduardo, paolozzi, chryssa, claes, oldenburg, george, segal, edward, kienholz, nam, june, paik, wolf, vostell, duane, hanson, and, john, deandrea, explored, abstraction, imagery, and, figuration, through, video, art, environment, light, sculpture, and, installation, art, in, new, ways, conceptual, art, is, art, in, which, the, concept, s, or, idea, s, involved, in, the, work, take, precedence, over, traditional, aesthetic, and, material, concerns, works, include, one, and, three, chairs, 1965, is, by, joseph, kosuth, and, an, oak, tree, by, michael, craig, martin, and, those, of, joseph, beuys, james, turrell, and, jacek, tylicki, some, modern, sculpture, forms, are, now, practiced, outdoors, as, environmental, art, and, environmental, sculpture, often, in, full, view, of, spectators, light, sculpture, street, art, sculpture, and, site, specific, art, also, often, make, use, of, the, environment, ice, sculpture, is, a, form, of, ephemeral, sculpture, that, uses, ice, as, the, raw, material, it, is, popular, in, china, japan, canada, sweden, and, russia, ice, sculptures, feature, decoratively, in, some, cuisines, especially, in, asia, kinetic, sculptures, are, sculptures, that, are, designed, to, move, which, include, mobiles, snow, sculptures, are, usually, carved, out, of, a, single, block, of, snow, about, 6, to, 15, feet, 1, 8, to, 4, 6, m, on, each, side, and, weighing, about, 20, 30, tons, the, snow, is, densely, packed, into, a, form, after, having, been, produced, by, artificial, means, or, collected, from, the, ground, after, a, snowfall, sound, sculptures, take, the, form, of, indoor, sound, installations, outdoor, installations, such, as, aeolian, harps, automatons, or, be, more, or, less, near, conventional, musical, instruments, sound, sculpture, is, often, site, specific, art, toys, have, become, another, format, for, contemporary, artists, since, the, late, 1990s, such, as, those, produced, by, takashi, murakami, and, kid, robot, designed, by, michael, lau, or, hand, made, by, michael, leavitt, artist, sculptures, are, sensitive, to, environmental, conditions, such, as, temperature, humidity, and, exposure, to, light, and, ultraviolet, light, acid, rain, can, also, cause, damage, to, certain, building, materials, and, historical, monuments, this, results, when, sulfuric, acid, in, the, rain, chemically, reacts, with, the, calcium, compounds, in, the, stones, limestone, sandstone, marble, and, granite, to, create, gypsum, which, then, flakes, off, severe, air, pollution, also, causes, damage, to, historical, monuments, at, any, time, many, contemporary, sculptures, have, usually, been, on, display, in, public, places, theft, was, not, a, problem, as, pieces, were, instantly, recognisable, in, the, early, 21st, century, the, value, of, metal, rose, to, such, an, extent, that, theft, of, massive, bronze, sculpture, for, the, value, of, the, metal, became, a, problem, sculpture, worth, millions, being, stolen, and, melted, down, for, the, relatively, low, value, of, the, metal, a, tiny, fraction, of, the, value, of, the, artwork
