in, archaeology, cave, paintings, are, a, type, of, parietal, art, which, category, also, includes, petroglyphs, or, engravings, found, on, the, wall, or, ceilings, of, caves, the, term, usually, implies, prehistoric, origin, these, paintings, were, often, created, by, homo, sapiens, but, also, denisovans, and, neanderthals, other, species, in, the, same, homo, genus, discussion, around, prehistoric, art, is, important, in, understanding, the, history, of, the, homo, sapiens, species, and, how, homo, sapiens, have, come, to, have, unique, abstract, thoughts, some, point, to, these, prehistoric, paintings, as, possible, examples, of, creativity, spirituality, and, sentimental, thinking, in, prehistoric, humans, the, oldest, known, are, more, than, 40, 000, years, old, art, of, the, upper, paleolithic, and, found, in, the, caves, in, the, district, of, maros, sulawesi, indonesia, the, oldest, are, often, constructed, from, hand, stencils, and, simple, geometric, shapes, more, recently, in, 2021, cave, art, of, a, pig, found, in, sulawesi, indonesia, and, dated, to, over, 45, 500, years, ago, has, been, reported, a, 2018, study, claimed, an, age, of, 64, 000, years, for, the, oldest, examples, of, non, figurative, cave, art, in, the, iberian, peninsula, represented, by, three, red, non, figurative, symbols, found, in, the, caves, of, maltravieso, ardales, and, la, pasiega, spain, these, predate, the, appearance, of, modern, humans, in, europe, by, at, least, 20, 000, years, and, thus, must, have, been, made, by, neanderthals, rather, than, modern, humans, in, november, 2018, scientists, reported, the, discovery, of, the, then, oldest, known, figurative, art, painting, over, 40, 000, perhaps, as, old, as, 52, 000, years, old, of, an, unknown, animal, in, the, cave, of, lubang, jeriji, sal, h, on, the, indonesian, island, of, borneo, in, december, 2019, cave, paintings, portraying, pig, hunting, within, the, maros, pangkep, karst, region, in, sulawesi, were, discovered, to, be, even, older, with, an, estimated, age, of, at, least, 43, 900, years, this, finding, was, recognized, as, the, oldest, known, depiction, of, storytelling, and, the, earliest, instance, of, figurative, art, in, human, history, on, july, 3, 2024, the, journal, nature, published, research, findings, indicating, that, the, cave, paintings, which, depict, anthropomorphic, figures, interacting, with, a, pig, and, measure, 36, by, 15, inches, 91, by, 38, cm, in, leang, karampuang, are, approximately, 51, 200, years, old, establishing, them, as, the, oldest, known, paintings, in, the, world, nearly, 350, caves, have, now, been, discovered, in, france, and, spain, that, contain, art, from, prehistoric, times, initially, the, age, of, the, paintings, had, been, a, contentious, issue, since, methods, like, radiocarbon, dating, can, produce, misleading, results, if, contaminated, by, other, samples, and, caves, and, rocky, overhangs, where, parietal, art, is, found, are, typically, littered, with, debris, from, many, time, periods, but, subsequent, technology, has, made, it, possible, to, date, the, paintings, by, sampling, the, pigment, itself, torch, marks, on, the, walls, or, the, formation, of, carbonate, deposits, on, top, of, the, paintings, the, subject, matter, can, also, indicate, chronology, for, instance, the, reindeer, depicted, in, the, spanish, cave, of, cueva, de, las, monedas, places, the, drawings, in, the, last, ice, age, the, oldest, known, cave, painting, is, a, red, hand, stencil, in, maltravieso, cave, c, ceres, spain, it, has, been, dated, using, the, uranium, thorium, method, to, older, than, 64, 000, years, and, was, made, by, a, neanderthal, the, oldest, date, given, to, an, animal, cave, painting, is, now, a, depiction, of, several, human, figures, hunting, pigs, in, the, caves, in, the, maros, pangkep, karst, of, south, sulawesi, indonesia, dated, to, be, over, 43, 900, years, old, before, this, the, oldest, known, figurative, cave, paintings, were, that, of, a, bull, dated, to, 40, 000, years, at, lubang, jeriji, sal, h, cave, east, kalimantan, indonesian, borneo, and, a, depiction, of, a, pig, with, a, minimum, age, of, 35, 400, years, at, timpuseng, cave, in, sulawesi, the, earliest, known, european, figurative, cave, paintings, are, those, of, chauvet, cave, in, france, dating, to, earlier, than, 30, 000, bc, in, the, upper, paleolithic, according, to, radiocarbon, dating, some, researchers, believe, the, drawings, are, too, advanced, for, this, era, and, question, this, age, more, than, 80, radiocarbon, dates, had, been, obtained, by, 2011, with, samples, taken, from, torch, marks, and, from, the, paintings, themselves, as, well, as, from, animal, bones, and, charcoal, found, on, the, cave, floor, the, radiocarbon, dates, from, these, samples, show, that, there, were, two, periods, of, creation, in, chauvet, 35, 000, years, ago, and, 30, 000, years, ago, one, of, the, surprises, was, that, many, of, the, paintings, were, modified, repeatedly, over, thousands, of, years, possibly, explaining, the, confusion, about, finer, paintings, that, seemed, to, date, earlier, than, cruder, ones, in, 2009, cavers, discovered, drawings, in, coliboaia, cave, in, romania, stylistically, comparable, to, those, at, chauvet, an, initial, dating, puts, the, age, of, an, image, in, the, same, range, as, chauvet, about, 32, 000, years, old, in, australia, cave, paintings, have, been, found, on, the, arnhem, land, plateau, showing, megafauna, which, are, thought, to, have, been, extinct, for, over, 40, 000, years, making, this, site, another, candidate, for, oldest, known, painting, however, the, proposed, age, is, dependent, on, the, estimate, of, the, extinction, of, the, species, seemingly, depicted, another, australian, site, nawarla, gabarnmang, has, charcoal, drawings, that, have, been, radiocarbon, dated, to, 28, 000, years, making, it, the, oldest, site, in, australia, and, among, the, oldest, in, the, world, for, which, reliable, date, evidence, has, been, obtained, other, examples, may, date, as, late, as, the, early, bronze, age, but, the, well, known, magdalenian, style, seen, at, lascaux, in, france, c, 15, 000, bc, and, altamira, in, spain, died, out, about, 10, 000, bc, coinciding, with, the, advent, of, the, neolithic, period, some, caves, probably, continued, to, be, painted, over, a, period, of, several, thousands, of, years, the, next, phase, of, surviving, european, prehistoric, painting, the, rock, art, of, the, iberian, mediterranean, basin, was, very, different, concentrating, on, large, assemblies, of, smaller, and, much, less, detailed, figures, with, at, least, as, many, humans, as, animals, this, was, created, roughly, between, 10, 000, and, 5, 500, years, ago, and, painted, in, rock, shelters, under, cliffs, or, shallow, caves, in, contrast, to, the, recesses, of, deep, caves, used, in, the, earlier, and, much, colder, period, although, individual, figures, are, less, naturalistic, they, are, grouped, in, coherent, grouped, compositions, to, a, much, greater, degree, over, a, long, period, of, time, the, cave, art, has, become, less, naturalistic, and, has, graduated, from, beautiful, naturalistic, animal, drawings, to, simple, ones, and, then, to, abstract, shapes, cave, artists, use, a, variety, of, techniques, such, as, finger, tracing, modeling, in, clay, engravings, bas, relief, sculpture, hand, stencils, and, paintings, done, in, two, or, three, colors, scholars, classify, cave, art, as, signs, or, abstract, marks, the, most, common, subjects, in, cave, paintings, are, large, wild, animals, such, as, bison, horses, aurochs, and, deer, and, tracings, of, human, hands, as, well, as, abstract, patterns, called, finger, flutings, the, species, found, most, often, were, suitable, for, hunting, by, humans, but, were, not, necessarily, the, actual, typical, prey, found, in, associated, deposits, of, bones, for, example, the, painters, of, lascaux, have, mainly, left, reindeer, bones, but, this, species, does, not, appear, at, all, in, the, cave, paintings, where, equine, species, are, the, most, common, drawings, of, humans, were, rare, and, are, usually, schematic, as, opposed, to, the, more, detailed, and, naturalistic, images, of, animal, subjects, kieran, d, o, hara, geologist, suggests, in, his, book, cave, art, and, climate, change, that, climate, controlled, the, themes, depicted, pigments, used, include, red, and, yellow, ochre, hematite, manganese, oxide, and, charcoal, sometimes, the, silhouette, of, the, animal, was, incised, in, the, rock, first, and, in, some, caves, all, or, many, of, the, images, are, only, engraved, in, this, fashion, taking, them, somewhat, out, of, a, strict, definition, of, cave, painting, similarly, large, animals, are, also, the, most, common, subjects, in, the, many, small, carved, and, engraved, bone, or, ivory, less, often, stone, pieces, dating, from, the, same, periods, but, these, include, the, group, of, venus, figurines, which, with, a, few, incomplete, exceptions, have, no, real, equivalent, in, paleolithic, cave, paintings, one, counterexample, is, a, feminine, figure, in, the, chauvet, cave, as, described, in, an, interview, with, dominique, baffier, in, cave, of, forgotten, dreams, hand, stencils, formed, by, placing, a, hand, against, the, wall, and, covering, the, surrounding, area, in, pigment, result, in, the, characteristic, image, of, a, roughly, round, area, of, solid, pigment, with, the, negative, shape, of, the, hand, in, the, centre, these, may, then, be, decorated, with, dots, dashes, and, patterns, often, these, are, found, in, the, same, caves, as, other, paintings, or, may, be, the, only, form, of, painting, in, a, location, some, walls, contain, many, hand, stencils, similar, hands, are, also, painted, in, the, usual, fashion, a, number, of, hands, show, a, finger, wholly, or, partly, missing, for, which, a, number, of, explanations, have, been, given, hand, images, are, found, in, similar, forms, in, europe, eastern, asia, australia, and, south, america, one, site, in, baja, california, features, handprints, as, a, prominent, motif, in, its, rock, art, archaeological, study, of, this, site, revealed, that, based, on, the, size, of, the, handprints, they, most, likely, belonged, to, the, women, of, the, community, in, addition, to, this, they, were, likely, used, during, initiation, rituals, in, chinigchinich, religious, practices, which, were, commonly, practiced, in, the, luise, o, territory, where, this, site, is, located, in, the, early, 20th, century, following, the, work, of, walter, baldwin, spencer, and, francis, james, gillen, scholars, such, as, salomon, reinach, henri, breuil, and, count, b, gou, n, interpreted, the, paintings, as, utilitarian, hunting, magic, to, increase, the, abundance, of, prey, jacob, bronowski, states, i, think, that, the, power, that, we, see, expressed, here, for, the, first, time, is, the, power, of, anticipation, the, forward, looking, imagination, in, these, paintings, the, hunter, was, made, familiar, with, dangers, which, he, knew, he, had, to, face, but, to, which, he, had, not, yet, come, another, theory, developed, by, david, lewis, williams, and, broadly, based, on, ethnographic, studies, of, contemporary, hunter, gatherer, societies, is, that, the, paintings, were, made, by, paleolithic, shamans, the, shaman, would, retreat, into, the, darkness, of, the, caves, enter, into, a, trance, state, then, paint, images, of, their, visions, perhaps, with, some, notion, of, drawing, out, power, from, the, cave, walls, themselves, r, dale, guthrie, who, has, studied, both, highly, artistic, and, lower, quality, art, and, figurines, identifies, a, wide, range, of, skill, and, age, among, the, artists, he, hypothesizes, that, the, main, themes, in, the, paintings, and, other, artifacts, powerful, beasts, risky, hunting, scenes, and, the, representation, of, women, in, the, venus, figurines, are, the, work, of, adolescent, males, who, constituted, a, large, part, of, the, human, population, at, the, time, however, in, analyzing, hand, prints, and, stencils, in, french, and, spanish, caves, dean, snow, of, pennsylvania, state, university, has, proposed, that, a, proportion, of, them, including, those, around, the, spotted, horses, in, pech, merle, were, of, female, hands, analysis, in, 2022, led, by, bennet, bacon, an, amateur, archaeologist, along, with, a, team, of, professional, archeologists, and, psychologists, at, the, university, of, durham, including, paul, pettitt, and, robert, william, kentridge, suggested, that, lines, and, dots, and, a, commonly, seen, if, curious, y, symbol, which, was, proposed, to, mean, to, give, birth, on, upper, palaeolithic, cave, paintings, correlated, with, the, mating, cycle, of, animals, in, a, lunar, calendar, potentially, making, them, the, earliest, known, evidence, of, a, proto, writing, system, and, explaining, one, object, of, many, cave, paintings, well, known, cave, paintings, include, those, of, other, sites, include, creswell, crags, nottinghamshire, england, 14, 500, ys, old, cave, etchings, and, bas, reliefs, discovered, in, 2003, pe, tera, coliboaia, in, romania, 29, 000, y, o, art, rock, painting, was, also, performed, on, cliff, faces, but, fewer, of, those, have, survived, because, of, erosion, one, example, is, the, rock, paintings, of, astuvansalmi, 3, 000, 2, 500, bc, in, the, saimaa, area, of, finland, when, marcelino, sanz, de, sautuola, first, encountered, the, magdalenian, paintings, of, the, cave, of, altamira, in, cantabria, spain, in, 1879, the, academics, of, the, time, considered, them, hoaxes, recent, reappraisals, and, numerous, additional, discoveries, have, since, demonstrated, their, authenticity, while, at, the, same, time, stimulating, interest, in, the, artistry, and, symbolism, of, upper, palaeolithic, peoples, in, indonesia, the, caves, in, the, district, of, maros, in, sulawesi, are, famous, for, their, hand, prints, about, 1, 500, negative, handprints, have, also, been, found, in, 30, painted, caves, in, the, sangkulirang, area, of, kalimantan, preliminary, dating, analysis, as, of, 2005, put, their, age, in, the, range, of, 10, 000, years, old, a, 2014, study, based, on, uranium, thorium, dating, dated, a, maros, hand, stencil, to, a, minimum, age, of, 39, 900, years, a, painting, of, a, babirusa, was, dated, to, at, least, 35, 4, ka, placing, it, among, the, oldest, known, figurative, depictions, worldwide, in, november, 2018, scientists, reported, the, discovery, of, the, oldest, known, figurative, art, painting, over, 40, 000, perhaps, as, old, as, 52, 000, years, old, of, an, unknown, animal, in, the, cave, of, lubang, jeriji, sal, h, on, the, indonesian, island, of, borneo, and, more, recently, in, 2021, archaeologists, announced, the, discovery, of, cave, art, at, least, 45, 500, years, old, in, leang, tedongnge, cave, indonesia, according, to, the, journal, science, advances, the, cave, painting, of, a, warty, pig, is, the, earliest, evidence, of, human, settlement, of, the, region, it, has, been, reported, that, it, is, rapidly, deteriorating, as, a, result, of, climate, change, in, the, region, originating, in, the, paleolithic, period, the, rock, art, found, in, khoit, tsenkher, cave, mongolia, includes, symbols, and, animal, forms, painted, from, the, walls, up, to, the, ceiling, stags, buffalo, oxen, ibex, lions, argali, sheep, antelopes, camels, elephants, ostriches, and, other, animal, pictorials, are, present, often, forming, a, palimpsest, of, overlapping, images, the, paintings, appear, brown, or, red, in, color, and, are, stylistically, similar, to, other, paleolithic, rock, art, from, around, the, world, but, are, unlike, any, other, examples, in, mongolia, the, padah, lin, caves, of, burma, contain, 11, 000, year, old, paintings, and, many, rock, tools, the, ambadevi, rock, shelters, have, the, oldest, cave, paintings, in, india, dating, back, to, 25, 000, years, the, bhimbetka, rock, shelters, are, dated, to, about, 8, 000, bc, similar, paintings, are, found, in, other, parts, of, india, as, well, in, tamil, nadu, ancient, paleolithic, cave, paintings, are, found, in, kombaikadu, kilvalai, settavarai, and, nehanurpatti, in, odisha, they, are, found, in, yogimatha, and, gudahandi, in, karnataka, these, paintings, are, found, in, hiregudda, near, badami, the, most, recent, painting, consisting, of, geometric, figures, date, to, the, medieval, period, executed, mainly, in, red, and, white, with, the, occasional, use, of, green, and, yellow, the, paintings, depict, the, lives, and, times, of, the, people, who, lived, in, the, caves, including, scenes, of, childbirth, communal, dancing, and, drinking, religious, rites, and, burials, as, well, as, indigenous, animals, cave, paintings, found, at, the, apollo, 11, cave, in, namibia, are, estimated, to, date, from, approximately, 25, 500, 27, 500, years, ago, in, 2011, archaeologists, found, a, small, rock, fragment, at, blombos, cave, about, 300, km, 190, mi, east, of, cape, town, on, the, southern, cape, coastline, in, south, africa, among, spear, points, and, other, excavated, material, after, extensive, testing, for, seven, years, it, was, revealed, that, the, lines, drawn, on, the, rock, were, handmade, and, from, an, ochre, crayon, dating, back, 73, 000, years, this, makes, it, the, oldest, known, rock, painting, significant, early, cave, paintings, executed, in, ochre, have, been, found, in, kimberley, and, kakadu, australia, ochre, is, not, an, organic, material, so, carbon, dating, of, these, pictures, is, often, impossible, the, oldest, so, far, dated, at, 17, 300, years, is, an, ochre, painting, of, a, kangaroo, in, the, kimberley, region, which, was, dated, by, carbon, dating, wasp, nest, material, underlying, and, overlying, the, painting, sometimes, the, approximate, date, or, at, least, an, epoch, can, be, surmised, from, the, painting, content, contextual, artifacts, or, organic, material, intentionally, or, inadvertently, mixed, with, the, inorganic, ochre, paint, including, torch, soot, a, red, ochre, painting, discovered, at, the, centre, of, the, arnhem, land, plateau, depicts, two, emu, like, birds, with, their, necks, outstretched, they, have, been, identified, by, a, palaeontologist, as, depicting, the, megafauna, species, genyornis, giant, birds, thought, to, have, become, extinct, more, than, 40, 000, years, ago, however, this, evidence, is, inconclusive, for, dating, it, may, suggest, that, genyornis, became, extinct, at, a, later, date, than, previously, determined, hook, island, in, the, whitsunday, islands, is, also, home, to, a, number, of, cave, paintings, created, by, the, seafaring, ngaro, people, in, the, philippines, at, tabon, caves, the, oldest, artwork, may, be, a, relief, of, a, shark, above, the, cave, entrance, it, was, partially, disfigured, by, a, later, jar, burial, scene, the, edakkal, caves, of, kerala, india, contain, drawings, that, range, over, periods, from, the, neolithic, as, early, as, 5, 000, bc, to, 1, 000, bc, rock, art, near, qohaito, appears, to, indicate, habitation, in, the, area, since, the, fifth, millennium, bc, while, the, town, is, known, to, have, survived, to, the, sixth, century, ad, mount, emba, soira, eritrea, s, highest, mountain, lies, near, the, site, as, does, a, small, successor, village, much, of, the, rock, art, sites, are, found, together, with, evidence, of, prehistoric, stone, tools, suggesting, that, the, art, could, predate, the, widely, presumed, pastoralist, and, domestication, events, that, occurred, 5, 000, 4, 000, years, ago, in, 2002, a, french, archaeological, team, discovered, the, laas, geel, cave, paintings, on, the, outskirts, of, hargeisa, in, somaliland, dating, back, around, 5, 000, years, the, paintings, depict, both, wild, animals, and, decorated, cows, they, also, feature, herders, who, are, believed, to, be, the, creators, of, the, rock, art, in, 2008, somali, archaeologists, announced, the, discovery, of, other, cave, paintings, in, dhambalin, region, which, the, researchers, suggest, includes, one, of, the, earliest, known, depictions, of, a, hunter, on, horseback, the, rock, art, is, dated, to, 1000, to, 3000, bc, additionally, between, the, towns, of, las, khorey, and, el, ayo, in, karinhegane, is, a, site, of, numerous, cave, paintings, of, real, and, mythical, animals, each, painting, has, an, inscription, below, it, which, collectively, have, been, estimated, to, be, around, 2, 500, years, old, karihegane, s, rock, art, is, in, the, same, distinctive, style, as, the, laas, geel, and, dhambalin, cave, paintings, around, 25, miles, from, las, khorey, is, found, gelweita, another, key, rock, art, site, in, djibouti, rock, art, of, what, appear, to, be, antelopes, and, a, giraffe, are, also, found, at, dorra, and, balho, many, cave, paintings, are, found, in, the, tassili, n, ajjer, mountains, in, southeast, algeria, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, the, rock, art, was, first, discovered, in, 1933, and, has, since, yielded, 15, 000, engravings, and, drawings, that, keep, a, record, of, the, various, animal, migrations, climatic, shifts, and, change, in, human, inhabitation, patterns, in, this, part, of, the, sahara, from, 6000, bc, to, the, late, classical, period, other, cave, paintings, are, also, found, at, the, akakus, mesak, settafet, and, tadrart, in, libya, and, other, sahara, regions, including, ayr, mountains, niger, and, tibesti, chad, the, cave, of, swimmers, and, the, cave, of, beasts, in, southwest, egypt, near, the, border, with, libya, in, the,

by, the, san, people, who, settled, in, the, area, some, 8, 000, years, ago, depict, animals, and, humans, and, are, thought, to, represent, religious, beliefs, human, figures, are, much, more, common, in, the, rock, art, of, africa, than, in, europe, distinctive, monochrome, and, polychrome, cave, paintings, and, murals, exist, in, the, mid, peninsula, regions, of, southern, baja,

to, the, sierras, of, this, region, but, can, also, be, found, in, outlying, mesas, and, rock, shelters, according, to, recent, radiocarbon, studies, of, the, area, of, materials, recovered, from, archaeological, deposits, in, the, rock, shelters, and, on, materials, in, the, paintings, themselves, suggest, that, the, great, murals, may, have, a, time, range, extending, as, far, back, as, 7,
