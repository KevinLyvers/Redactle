jazz, the, influence, of, jelly, roll, morton, continued, in, the, harlem, stride, piano, style, of, players, such, as, james, p, johnson, and, fats, waller, ragtime, was, also, a, major, influence, on, piedmont, blues, dance, orchestras, started, evolving, away, from, ragtime, towards, the, big, band, sounds, that, predominated, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, when, they, adopted, smoother, rhythmic, styles, there, have, been, numerous, revivals, since, newer, styles, supplanted, ragtime, in, the, 1920s, first, in, the, early, 1940s, many, jazz, bands, began, to, include, ragtime, in, their, repertoire, and, put, out, ragtime, recordings, on, 78, rpm, records, a, more, significant, revival, occurred, in, the, 1950s, as, a, wider, variety, of, ragtime, genres, of, the, past, were, made, available, on, records, and, new, rags, were, composed, published, and, recorded, in, the, 1960s, two, major, factors, brought, about, a, greater, public, recognition, of, ragtime, the, first, was, the, publication, of, the, book, they, all, played, ragtime, in, 1960, by, harriet, janis, and, rudi, blesh, some, historians, refer, to, this, book, as, the, ragtime, bible, regardless, it, was, the, first, comprehensive, and, serious, attempt, to, document, the, first, ragtime, era, and, its, three, most, important, composers, joplin, scott, and, lamb, the, second, major, factor, was, the, rise, to, prominence, of, max, morath, morath, created, two, television, series, for, national, educational, television, now, pbs, in, 1960, and, 1962, the, ragtime, era, and, the, turn, of, the, century, morath, turned, the, latter, into, a, one, man, show, in, 1969, and, toured, the, u, s, with, it, for, five, years, morath, subsequently, created, different, one, man, shows, which, also, toured, the, u, s, that, also, educated, and, entertained, audiences, about, ragtime, new, ragtime, composers, soon, followed, including, morath, donald, ashwander, trebor, jay, tichenor, john, arpin, william, bolcom, william, albright, in, 1971, joshua, rifkin, released, a, compilation, of, joplin, s, work, which, was, nominated, for, a, grammy, award, in, 1973, the, new, england, ragtime, ensemble, then, a, student, group, called, the, new, england, conservatory, ragtime, ensemble, recorded, the, red, back, book, a, compilation, of, some, of, joplin, s, rags, in, period, orchestrations, edited, by, conservatory, president, gunther, schuller, it, won, a, grammy, for, best, chamber, music, performance, of, the, year, and, was, named, top, classical, album, of, 1974, by, billboard, magazine, the, film, the, sting, 1973, brought, ragtime, to, a, wide, audience, with, its, soundtrack, of, joplin, tunes, the, film, s, rendering, of, the, entertainer, adapted, and, orchestrated, by, marvin, hamlisch, was, a, top, 5, hit, in, 1975, ragtime, with, joplin, s, work, at, the, forefront, has, been, cited, as, an, american, equivalent, of, the, minuets, of, mozart, the, mazurkas, of, chopin, or, the, waltzes, of, brahms, ragtime, also, influenced, classical, composers, including, erik, satie, claude, debussy, and, igor, stravinsky, ragtime, originated, in, african, american, music, in, the, late, 19th, century, and, descended, from, the, jigs, and, march, music, played, by, african, american, bands, referred, to, as, jig, piano, or, piano, thumping, by, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, it, became, widely, popular, throughout, north, america, and, was, listened, and, danced, to, performed, and, written, by, people, of, many, different, subcultures, a, distinctly, american, musical, style, ragtime, may, be, considered, a, synthesis, of, african, syncopation, and, european, classical, music, especially, the, marches, made, popular, by, john, philip, sousa, some, early, piano, rags, were, classified, as, jig, rag, and, coon, songs, these, labels, were, sometimes, used, interchangeably, in, the, mid, 1890s, 1900s, and, 1910s, ragtime, was, also, preceded, by, its, close, relative, the, cakewalk, in, 1895, black, entertainer, ernest, hogan, released, the, earliest, ragtime, composition, called, la, pas, ma, la, the, following, year, he, released, another, composition, called, all, coons, look, alike, to, me, which, eventually, sold, a, million, copies, tom, fletcher, a, vaudeville, entertainer, and, the, author, of, 100, years, of, the, negro, in, show, business, has, stated, that, hogan, was, the, first, to, put, on, paper, the, kind, of, rhythm, that, was, being, played, by, non, reading, musicians, while, the, success, of, all, coons, look, alike, to, me, helped, popularize, the, country, to, ragtime, rhythms, its, use, of, racial, slurs, created, a, number, of, derogatory, imitation, tunes, known, as, coon, songs, because, of, their, use, of, racist, and, stereotypical, images, of, black, people, in, hogan, s, later, years, he, admitted, shame, and, a, sense, of, race, betrayal, from, the, song, while, also, expressing, pride, in, helping, bring, ragtime, to, a, larger, audience, the, emergence, of, mature, ragtime, is, usually, dated, to, 1897, the, year, in, which, several, important, early, rags, were, published, harlem, rag, by, tom, turpin, and, mississippi, rag, by, william, krell, were, both, release, that, year, in, 1899, scott, joplin, s, maple, leaf, rag, was, published, and, became, a, great, hit, and, demonstrated, more, depth, and, sophistication, than, earlier, ragtime, ragtime, was, one, of, the, main, influences, on, the, early, development, of, jazz, along, with, the, blues, some, artists, such, as, jelly, roll, morton, were, present, and, performed, both, ragtime, and, jazz, styles, during, the, period, the, two, styles, overlapped, he, also, incorporated, the, spanish, tinge, in, his, performances, which, gave, a, habanera, or, tango, rhythm, to, his, music, jazz, largely, surpassed, ragtime, in, mainstream, popularity, in, the, early, 1920s, although, ragtime, compositions, continue, to, be, written, up, to, the, present, and, periodic, revivals, of, popular, interest, in, ragtime, occurred, in, the, 1950s, and, the, 1970s, the, heyday, of, ragtime, occurred, before, sound, recording, was, widely, available, like, european, classical, music, classical, ragtime, has, primarily, been, a, written, tradition, distributed, though, sheet, music, but, sheet, music, sales, ultimately, depended, on, the, skill, of, amateur, pianists, which, limited, classical, ragtime, s, complexity, and, proliferation, a, folk, ragtime, tradition, also, existed, before, and, during, the, period, of, classical, ragtime, a, designation, largely, created, by, scott, joplin, s, publisher, john, stillwell, stark, manifesting, itself, mostly, through, string, bands, banjo, and, mandolin, clubs, which, experienced, a, burst, of, popularity, during, the, early, 20th, century, and, the, like, ragtime, was, also, distributed, via, piano, rolls, for, mechanical, player, pianos, while, the, traditional, rag, was, fading, in, popularity, a, genre, called, novelty, piano, or, novelty, ragtime, emerged, that, took, advantage, of, new, advances, in, piano, roll, technology, and, the, phonograph, record, to, permit, a, more, complex, pyrotechnic, performance, oriented, style, of, rag, to, be, heard, chief, among, the, novelty, rag, composers, is, zez, confrey, whose, kitten, on, the, keys, popularized, the, style, in, 1921, ragtime, also, served, as, the, roots, for, stride, piano, a, more, improvisational, piano, style, popular, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, elements, of, ragtime, found, their, way, into, much, of, the, american, popular, music, of, the, early, 20th, century, it, also, played, a, central, role, in, the, development, of, the, musical, style, later, referred, to, as, piedmont, blues, indeed, much, of, the, music, played, by, such, artists, of, the, style, as, reverend, gary, davis, blind, boy, fuller, elizabeth, cotten, and, etta, baker, could, be, referred, to, as, ragtime, guitar, although, most, ragtime, was, composed, for, piano, transcriptions, for, other, instruments, and, ensembles, are, common, notably, including, gunther, schuller, s, arrangements, of, joplin, s, rags, ragtime, guitar, continued, to, be, popular, into, the, 1930s, usually, in, the, form, of, songs, accompanied, by, skilled, guitar, work, numerous, records, emanated, from, several, labels, performed, by, blind, blake, blind, boy, fuller, blind, lemon, jefferson, and, others, occasionally, ragtime, was, scored, for, ensembles, particularly, dance, bands, and, brass, bands, similar, to, those, of, james, reese, europe, or, as, songs, like, those, written, by, irving, berlin, joplin, had, long, standing, ambitions, of, synthesizing, the, worlds, of, ragtime, and, opera, to, which, end, the, opera, treemonisha, was, written, however, its, first, performance, poorly, staged, with, joplin, accompanying, on, the, piano, was, disastrous, and, was, never, performed, again, in, joplin, s, lifetime, the, score, was, lost, for, decades, then, rediscovered, in, 1970, and, a, fully, orchestrated, and, staged, performance, took, place, in, 1972, an, earlier, opera, by, joplin, a, guest, of, honor, has, been, lost, the, rag, was, a, modification, of, the, march, made, popular, by, john, philip, sousa, with, additional, polyrhythms, coming, from, african, music, it, was, usually, written, in, 2, 4, or, 4, 4, time, with, a, predominant, left, hand, pattern, of, bass, notes, on, strong, beats, beats, 1, and, 3, and, chords, on, weak, beats, beat, 2, and, 4, accompanying, a, syncopated, melody, in, the, right, hand, according, to, some, sources, the, name, ragtime, may, come, from, the, ragged, or, syncopated, rhythm, of, the, right, hand, a, rag, written, in, 3, 4, time, is, a, ragtime, waltz, ragtime, is, not, a, meter, in, the, same, way, that, marches, are, in, duple, meter, and, waltzes, are, in, triple, meter, it, is, rather, a, musical, style, that, uses, an, effect, that, can, be, applied, to, any, meter, the, defining, characteristic, of, ragtime, music, is, a, specific, type, of, syncopation, in, which, melodic, accents, occur, between, metrical, beats, this, results, in, a, melody, that, seems, to, be, avoiding, some, metrical, beats, of, the, accompaniment, by, emphasizing, notes, that, either, anticipate, or, follow, the, beat, a, rhythmic, base, of, metric, affirmation, and, a, melody, of, metric, denial, the, ultimate, and, intended, effect, on, the, listener, is, actually, to, accentuate, the, beat, thereby, inducing, the, listener, to, move, to, the, music, scott, joplin, the, composer, pianist, known, as, the, king, of, ragtime, called, the, effect, weird, and, intoxicating, he, also, used, the, term, swing, in, describing, how, to, play, ragtime, music, play, slowly, until, you, catch, the, swing, the, name, swing, later, came, to, be, applied, to, an, early, style, of, jazz, that, developed, from, ragtime, converting, a, non, ragtime, piece, of, music, into, ragtime, by, changing, the, time, values, of, melody, notes, is, known, as, ragging, the, piece, original, ragtime, pieces, usually, contain, several, distinct, themes, four, being, the, most, common, number, these, themes, were, typically, 16, bars, each, theme, divided, into, periods, of, four, four, bar, phrases, and, arranged, in, patterns, of, repeats, and, reprises, typical, patterns, were, aabbaccc, aabbccdd, and, aabbcca, with, the, first, two, strains, in, the, tonic, key, and, the, following, strains, in, the, subdominant, sometimes, rags, would, include, introductions, of, four, bars, or, bridges, between, themes, of, anywhere, between, four, and, 24, bars, in, a, note, on, the, sheet, music, for, the, song, leola, joplin, wrote, notice, don, t, play, this, piece, fast, it, is, never, right, to, play, ragtime, fast, e, l, doctorow, used, the, quotation, as, the, epigraph, to, his, novel, ragtime, ragtime, pieces, came, in, a, number, of, different, styles, during, the, years, of, its, popularity, and, appeared, under, a, number, of, different, descriptive, names, it, is, related, to, several, earlier, styles, of, music, has, close, ties, with, later, styles, of, music, and, was, associated, with, a, few, musical, fads, of, the, period, such, as, the, foxtrot, many, of, the, terms, associated, with, ragtime, have, inexact, definitions, and, are, defined, differently, by, different, experts, the, definitions, are, muddled, further, by, the, fact, that, publishers, often, labelled, pieces, for, the, fad, of, the, moment, rather, than, the, true, style, of, the, composition, there, is, even, disagreement, about, the, term, ragtime, itself, experts, such, as, david, jasen, and, trebor, tichenor, choose, to, exclude, ragtime, songs, from, the, definition, but, include, novelty, piano, and, stride, piano, a, modern, perspective, while, edward, a, berlin, includes, ragtime, songs, and, excludes, the, later, styles, which, is, closer, to, how, ragtime, was, viewed, originally, the, terms, below, should, not, be, considered, exact, but, merely, an, attempt, to, pin, down, the, general, meaning, of, the, concept, european, classical, composers, were, influenced, by, the, form, the, first, contact, with, ragtime, was, probably, at, the, paris, exposition, in, 1900, one, of, the, stages, of, the, european, tour, of, john, philip, sousa, the, first, notable, classical, composer, to, take, a, serious, interest, in, ragtime, was, anton, n, dvo, k, french, composer, claude, debussy, emulated, ragtime, in, three, pieces, for, piano, the, best, known, remains, the, golliwog, s, cake, walk, from, the, 1908, piano, suite, children, s, corner, he, later, returned, to, the, style, with, two, preludes, for, piano, minstrels, 1910, and, general, lavine, excentric, from, his, 1913, pr, ludes, which, was, inspired, by, a, m, drano, circus, clown, erik, satie, arthur, honegger, darius, milhaud, and, the, other, members, of, the, group, of, six, in, paris, never, made, any, secret, of, their, sympathy, for, ragtime, which, is, sometimes, evident, in, their, works, consider, in, particular, the, ballet, of, satie, parade, ragtime, du, paquebot, 1917, and, la, mort, de, monsieur, mouche, an, overture, for, piano, for, a, drama, in, three, acts, composed, in, the, early, 1900s, in, memory, of, his, friend, j, p, contamine, de, latour, in, 1902, the, american, cakewalk, was, very, popular, in, paris, and, satie, two, years, later, wrote, two, rags, la, diva, de, l, empire, and, piccadilly, despite, the, two, anglo, saxon, settings, the, tracks, appear, american, inspired, la, diva, de, l, empire, a, march, for, piano, soloist, was, written, for, paulette, darty, and, initially, bore, the, title, stand, walk, marche, it, was, later, subtitled, intermezzo, americain, when, rouarts, lerolle, reprinted, it, in, 1919, piccadilly, another, march, was, initially, titled, the, transatlantique, it, presented, a, stereotypical, wealthy, american, heir, sailing, on, an, ocean, liner, on, the, new, york, europe, route, going, to, trade, his, fortune, for, an, aristocratic, title, in, europe, there, is, a, similar, influence, in, milhaud, s, ballets, le, boeuf, sur, le, toite, and, creation, du, monde, which, he, wrote, after, a, visit, to, harlem, during, his, trip, in, 1922, even, the, swiss, composer, honegger, wrote, works, in, which, the, influence, of, african, american, music, is, pretty, obvious, examples, include, pacific, 231, pr, lude, et, blues, and, especially, the, concertino, for, piano, and, orchestra, igor, stravinsky, wrote, a, solo, piano, work, called, piano, rag,

the, 1950s, a, wider, variety, of, ragtime, styles, of, the, past, were, made, available, on, records, and, new, rags, were, composed, published, and, recorded, much, of, the, ragtime, recorded, in, this, period, is, presented, in, a, light, hearted, novelty, style, looked, to, with, nostalgia, as, the, product, of, a, supposedly, more, innocent, time, a, number, of, popular, recordings, featured, prepared, pianos, playing, rags, on, pianos, with, tacks, on, the, hammers, and, the, instrument, deliberately, somewhat, out, of, tune, supposedly, to, simulate, the, sound, of, a, piano,
