increasingly, suspicious, he, feels, that, he, is, being, followed, by, someone, dolores, is, familiar, with, humbert, increasingly, displays, signs, of, paranoia, and, mania, perhaps, caused, by, his, growing, certainty, that, he, and, dolores, are, being, trailed, by, someone, who, wants, to, separate, them, in, the, colorado, mountains, dolores, falls, ill, humbert, checks, her, into, a, local, hospital, from, where, she, is, discharged, one, night, by, her, uncle, humbert, knows, she, has, no, living, relatives, and, he, immediately, embarks, on, a, frantic, search, to, find,

with, a, pistol, tracks, down, her, address, against, her, wishes, at, dolores, request, he, pretends, to, be, her, estranged, father, and, does, not, mention, the, details, of, their, past, relationship, to, her, husband, richard, dolores, reveals, to, humbert, that, her, abductor, was, the, famous, playwright, clare, quilty, who, had, crossed, paths, with, humbert, and, dolores, several, times, she, explains, that, quilty, tracked, the, pair, with, her, assistance, and, took, her, from, the, hospital, because, she, was, in, love, with, him, however, he, later, kicked, her, out, when, she, refused, to, star, in, one, of, his, pornographic, films, humbert, claims, to, the, reader, that, at, this, moment, he, realized, that, he, was, in, love, with, dolores, all, along, humbert, implores, her, to, leave, with, him, but, she, refuses, accepting, her, decision, humbert, gives, her, the, money, she, is, owed, from, her, inheritance, humbert, then, goes, to, the, drug, addled, quilty, s, mansion, and, shoots, him, dead, shortly, afterward, humbert, is, arrested, and, in, his, closing, thoughts, he, reaffirms, his, love, for, dolores, and, asks, for, his, memoir, to, be, withheld, from, public, release, until, after, her, death, the, deaths, of, humbert, shortly, after, his, imprisonment, and, dolores, in, childbirth, on, christmas, day, 1952, have, been, already, related, in, the, foreword, lolita, is, frequently, described, as, an, erotic, novel, not, only, by, some, critics, but, also, in, a, standard, reference, work, on, literature, facts, on, file, companion, to, the, american, short, story, the, great, soviet, encyclopedia, called, lolita, an, experiment, in, combining, an, erotic, novel, with, an, instructive, novel, of, manners, the, same,

classifications, have, included, a, novel, with, erotic, motifs, or, one, of, a, number, of, works, of, classical, erotic, literature, and, art, and, to, novels, that, contain, elements, of, eroticism, such, as, ulysses, and, lady, chatterley, s, lover, this, classification, has, been, disputed, malcolm, bradbury, writes, at, first, famous, as, an, erotic, novel, lolita, soon, won, its, way, as, a, literary, one, a, late, modernist, distillation, of, the, whole, crucial, mythology, samuel, schuman, says, that, nabokov, is, a, surrealist, linked, to, gogol, dostoevsky, and, kafka, lolita, is, characterized, by, irony, and, sarcasm, it, is, not, an, erotic, novel, lance, olsen, writes, the, first, 13, chapters, of, the, text, culminating, with, the, oft, cited, scene, of, lo, unwittingly, stretching, her, legs, across, humbert, s, excited, lap, are, the, only, chapters, suggestive, of, the, erotic, nabokov, himself, observes, in, the, novel, s, afterword, that, a, few, readers, were, misled, into, assuming, this, was, going, to, be, a, lewd, book, the, rising, succession, of, erotic, scenes, when, these, stopped, the, readers, stopped, too, and, felt, bored, the, novel, is, narrated, by, humbert, who, riddles, the, narrative, with, word, play, and, his, wry, observations, of, american, culture, the, novel, s, flamboyant, style, is, characterized, by, double, entendres, multilingual, puns, anagrams, and, coinages, such, as, nymphet, a, word, that, has, since, had, a, life, of, its, own, and, can, be, found, in, most, dictionaries, and, the, lesser, used, faunlet, for, richard, rorty, in, his, interpretation, of, lolita, in, contingency, irony, and, solidarity, humbert, is, a, monster, of, incuriosity, 161, dramatizing, the, particular, form, of, cruelty, about, which, nabokov, worried, most, incuriosity, in, that, he, is, exquisitely, sensitive, to, everything, which, affects, or, provides, expression, for, his, own, obsession, and, entirely, incurious, about, anything, that, affects, anyone, else, 158, nabokov, who, famously, decried, social, satire, novels, with, direct, political, messages, and, those, he, considered, moralists, avoided, providing, any, overt, interpretations, to, his, work, however, when, prompted, in, a, 1967, interview, with, your, sense, of, the, immorality, of, the, relationship, between, humbert, humbert, and, lolita, is, very, strong, in, hollywood, and, new, york, however, relationships, are, frequent, between, men, of, forty, and, girls, very, little, older, than, lolita, they, marry, to, no, particular, public, outrage, rather, public, cooing, he, replied, no, it, is, not, my, sense, of, the, immorality, of, the, humbert, humbert, lolita, relationship, that, is, strong, it, is, humbert, s, sense, he, cares, i, do, not, i, do, not, give, a, damn, for, public, morals, in, america, or, elsewhere, and, anyway, cases, of, men, in, their, forties, marrying, girls, in, their, teens, or, early, twenties, have, no, bearing, on, lolita, whatever, humbert, was, fond, of, little, girls, not, simply, young, girls, nymphets, are, girl, children, not, starlets, and, sex, kittens, lolita, was, twelve, not, eighteen, when, humbert, met, her, you, may, remember, that, by, the, time, she, is, fourteen, he, refers, to, her, as, his, aging, mistress, nabokov, described, humbert, as, a, vain, and, cruel, wretch, who, manages, to, appear, touching, later, in, the, same, interview, when, asked, about, coming, up, with, humbert, s, doubled, name, he, described, it, as, a, hateful, name, for, a, hateful, person, it, is, also, a, kingly, name, and, i, did, need, a, royal, vibration, for, humbert, the, fierce, and, humbert, the, humble, critics, have, further, noted, that, since, the, novel, is, a, first, person, narrative, by, humbert, the, novel, gives, very, little, information, about, what, lolita, is, like, as, a, person, that, in, effect, she, has, been, silenced, by, not, being, the, book, s, narrator, nomi, tamir, ghez, writes, not, only, is, lolita, s, voice, silenced, her, point, of, view, the, way, she, sees, the, situation, and, feels, about, it, is, rarely, mentioned, and, can, be, only, surmised, by, the, reader, since, it, is, humbert, who, tells, the, story, throughout, most, of, the, novel, the, reader, is, absorbed, in, humbert, s, feelings, similarly, mica, howe, and, sarah, appleton, aguiar, write, that, the, novel, silences, and, objectifies, lolita, christine, clegg, notes, that, this, is, a, recurring, theme, in, criticism, of, the, novel, in, the, 1990s, actor, brian, cox, who, played, humbert, in, a, 2009, one, man, stage, monologue, based, on, the, novel, stated, that, the, novel, is, not, about, lolita, as, a, flesh, and, blood, entity, it, s, lolita, as, a, memory, he, concluded, that, a, stage, monologue, would, be, truer, to, the, book, than, any, film, could, possibly, be, elizabeth, janeway, writing, in, the, new, york, times, book, review, holds, humbert, is, every, man, who, is, driven, by, desire, wanting, his, lolita, so, badly, that, it, never, occurs, to, him, to, consider, her, as, a, human, being, or, as, anything, but, a, dream, figment, made, flesh, clegg, sees, the, novel, s, non, disclosure, of, lolita, s, feelings, as, directly, linked, to, the, fact, that, her, real, name, is, dolores, and, only, humbert, refers, to, her, as, lolita, humbert, also, states, he, has, effectively, solipsized, lolita, early, in, the, novel, eric, lemay, writes, the, human, child, the, one, noticed, by, non, nymphomaniacs, answers, to, other, names, lo, lola, dolly, and, least, alluring, of, all, dolores, but, in, my, arms, asserts, humbert, she, was, always, lolita, and, in, his, arms, or, out, lolita, was, always, the, creation, of, humbert, s, craven, self, the, siren, like, humbert, sings, a, song, of, himself, to, himself, and, titles, that, self, and, that, song, lolita, to, transform, dolores, into, lolita, to, seal, this, sad, adolescent, within, his, musky, self, humbert, must, deny, her, her, humanity, in, 2003, iranian, expatriate, azar, nafisi, published, the, memoir, reading, lolita, in, tehran, about, a, covert, women, s, reading, group, in, an, npr, interview, nafisi, contrasts, the, sorrowful, and, seductive, sides, of, dolores, lolita, s, character, she, notes, because, her, name, is, not, lolita, her, real, name, is, dolores, which, as, you, know, in, latin, means, dolour, so, her, real, name, is, associated, with, sorrow, and, with, anguish, and, with, innocence, while, lolita, becomes, a, sort, of, light, headed, seductive, and, airy, name, the, lolita, of, our, novel, is, both, of, these, at, the, same, time, and, in, our, culture, here, today, we, only, associate, it, with, one, aspect, of, that, little, girl, and, the, crassest, interpretation, of, her, following, nafisi, s, comments, the, npr, interviewer, madeleine, brand, lists, as, embodiments, of, the, latter, side, of, lolita, the, long, island, lolita, britney, spears, the, olsen, twins, and, sue, lyon, in, stanley, kubrick, s, lolita, for, nafisi, the, essence, of, the, novel, is, humbert, s, solipsism, and, his, erasure, of, lolita, s, independent, identity, she, writes, lolita, was, given, to, us, as, humbert, s, creature, to, reinvent, her, humbert, must, take, from, lolita, her, own, real, history, and, replace, it, with, his, own, yet, she, does, have, a, past, despite, humbert, s, attempts, to, orphan, lolita, by, robbing, her, of, her, history, that, past, is, still, given, to, us, in, glimpses, one, of, the, novel, s, early, champions, lionel, trilling, warned, in, 1958, of, the, moral, difficulty, in, interpreting, a, book, with, so, eloquent, and, so, self, deceived, a, narrator, we, find, ourselves, the, more, shocked, when, we, realize, that, in, the, course, of, reading, the, novel, we, have, come, virtually, to, condone, the, violation, it, presents, we, have, been, seduced, into, conniving, in, the, violation, because, we, have, permitted, our, fantasies, to, accept, what, we, know, to, be, revolting, in, 1958, dorothy, parker, described, the, novel, as, the, engrossing, anguished, story, of, a, man, a, man, of, taste, and, culture, who, can, love, only, little, girls, and, lolita, as, a, dreadful, little, creature, selfish, hard, vulgar, and, foul, tempered, in, 1959, novelist, robertson, davies, wrote, that, the, theme, of, lolita, is, not, the, corruption, of, an, innocent, child, by, a, cunning, adult, but, the, exploitation, of, a, weak, adult, by, a, corrupt, child, this, is, no, pretty, theme, but, it, is, one, with, which, social, workers, magistrates, and, psychiatrists, are, familiar, in, his, essay, on, stalinism, koba, the, dread, martin, amis, proposes, that, lolita, is, an, elaborate, metaphor, for, the, totalitarianism, that, destroyed, the, russia, of, nabokov, s, childhood, though, nabokov, states, in, his, afterword, that, he, symbols, and, allegories, amis, interprets, it, as, a, story, of, tyranny, told, from, the, point, of, view, of, the, tyrant, nabokov, in, all, his, fiction, writes, with, incomparable, penetration, about, delusion, and, coercion, about, cruelty, and, lies, he, says, even, lolita, especially, lolita, is, a, study, in, tyranny, the, term, lolita, has, been, assimilated, into, popular, culture, as, a, description, of, a, young, girl, who, is, precociously, seductive, without, connotations, of, victimization, in, japan, the, novel, gave, rise, in, the, early, 1980s, to, lolicon, a, genre, of, fictional, media, in, which, young, or, young, looking, girl, characters, appear, in, romantic, or, sexual, contexts, literary, critics, and, commentators, almost, universally, regard, humbert, as, an, unreliable, narrator, although, the, nature, of, his, unreliability, is, a, matter, of, debate, 13, 55, 56, the, literary, critic, wayne, c, booth, coined, the, term, unreliable, narrator, to, describe, a, narrator, whose, ethical, norms, differ, from, those, of, the, implied, author, 158, 159, while, booth, s, definition, has, served, as, the, basis, for, most, subsequent, narratological, analysis, some, commentators, have, disregarded, his, definition, to, classify, humbert, as, unreliable, based, on, the, dishonesty, of, his, character, and, motives, 55, 56, booth, places, humbert, in, a, literary, tradition, of, unreliable, narrators, that, is, full, of, traps, for, the, unsuspecting, reader, some, of, them, not, particularly, harmful, but, some, of, them, crippling, or, even, fatal, 239, booth, cites, trilling, s, inability, to, decide, whether, or, not, humbert, s, final, indictment, of, his, own, morality, is, to, be, taken, seriously, and, trilling, s, conclusion, that, this, ambiguity, made, the, novel, better, not, worse, in, its, ability, to, arouse, uneasiness, as, evidence, of, irony, s, literary, triumph, over, clarity, and, simplicity, 371, 372, for, booth, one, of, lolita, s, main, appeals, is, watching, humbert, almost, make, a, case, for, himself, as, nabokov, gives, him, full, and, unlimited, control, of, the, rhetorical, resources, booth, trusts, that, skilful, and, mature, readers, will, repudiate, humbert, s, blandishments, picking, up, on, nabokov, s, ironies, clues, and, dead, giveaway, style, but, many, readers, will, identify, humbert, with, the, author, more, than, nabokov, intends, unable, to, dissociate, themselves, from, a, vicious, center, of, consciousness, presented, with, all, of, the, seductive, self, justification, of, skilful, rhetoric, 390, 391, literary, scholar, james, phelan, notes, that, booth, s, commentary, on, lolita, served, as, a, flashpoint, for, resistance, from, readers, of, the, new, criticism, school, to, booth, s, conception, of, fiction, as, rhetorical, action, booth, acknowledges, that, nabokov, marks, humbert, as, unreliable, while, also, complaining, about, lolita, s, morality, he, considers, the, novel, delightful, and, profound, while, also, condemning, humbert, s, actions, in, violating, lolita, 223, phelan, addresses, this, problem, of, the, relation, between, technique, and, ethics, in, lolita, by, attempting, to, account, for, two, especially, notable, groups, of, readers, those, who, are, taken, in, by, humbert, s, artful, narration, and, those, who, resist, all, of, his, rhetorical, appeals, 223, phelan, theorizes, that, accounting, for, these, two, audiences, will, also, account, for, the, relations, between, two, groups, often, separated, by, rhetorical, theory, the, authorial, audience, the, hypothetical, readers, for, whom, the, author, writes, and, who, ground, the, author, s, rhetorical, choices, and, the, flesh, and, blood, readers, the, people, actually, reading, the, book, 223, phelan, distinguishes, two, techniques, of, unreliable, narration, estranging, unreliability, which, increases, the, distance, between, narrator, and, audience, and, bonding, unreliability, which, reduces, the, distance, between, narrator, and, audience, 223, 224, and, argues, that, nabokov, employs, both, types, of, unreliability, and, a, coding, in, which, he, gives, the, narration, many, marks, of, bonding, unreliability, but, ultimately, marks, it, as, estranging, unreliability, in, this, way, nabokov, persuades, the, authorial, audience, towards, humbert, before, estranging, them, from, him, 232, phelan, concludes, that, this, process, results, in, two, misreadings, of, the, novel, many, readers, will, be, taken, in, by, humbert, s, narration, missing, the, marks, of, estranging, unreliability, or, detecting, only, some, of, the, narrator, s, tricks, while, other, readers, in, decoding, the, estranging, unreliability, will, conclude, that, all, of, humbert, s, narration, is, unreliable, 236, william, riggan, places, humbert, in, a, tradition, of, unreliable, narration, embodied, by, the, fool, or, clown, in, particular, the, disguised, insight, of, the, wise, fool, and, the, ironies, variations, and, ambiguities, of, the, sotie, 82, for, riggan, humbert, s, imprisonment, in, art, and, solipsism, makes, his, account, a, parodic, burlesque, of, confessional, writing, that, suspends, the, possibility, of, a, realistic, fiction, in, which, humbert, s, point, of, view, is, credible, 94, 85, while, superficially, allied, in, his, artistic, aims, with, nabokov, s, espousal, of, esthetic, bliss, as, the, foremost, criterion, in, the, novel, 92, humbert, separates, himself, with, his, contradictory, depictions, of, himself, and, lolita, as, literary, constructs, humbert, depicts, himself, as, alternately, monstrous, buffoonish, witty, brutish, tender, malevolent, and, kind, 93, he, self, consciously, casts, himself, in, the, buffoonish, role, of, a, combination, of, urbane, satirist, brutish, satyr, and, sadly, gleeful, harlequin, 176, he, both, caricatures, lolita, as, commonplace, and, idealizes, her, into, a, solipsized, vision, entirely, different, from, the, real, lolita, 93, riggan, sees, humbert, as, personifying, the, spirit, of, harlequin, or, a, sottie, clown, who, annihilates, reality, turns, life, into, a, game, and, the, world, upside, down, and, ends, by, creating, chaos, 97, some, critics, point, to, chronological, discrepancies, in, lolita, as, intentional, and, centrally, relevant, to, humbert, s, unreliable, narration, christina, tekiner, views, the, discrepancies, as, evidence, that, the, last, nine, chapters, of, the, novel, are, a, product, of, humbert, s, imagination, and, leona, toker, believes, that, the, crafty, handling, of, dates, exposes, humbert, s, cognitive, unreliability, other, critics, such, as, brian, boyd, explain, the, discrepancies, as, nabokov, s, errors, nabokov, finished, lolita, on, 6, december, 1953, five, years, after, starting, it, because, of, its, subject, matter, nabokov, intended, to, publish, it, pseudonymously, although, the, anagrammatic, character, vivian, darkbloom, would, tip, off, the, alert, reader, the, manuscript, was, turned, down, with, more, or, less, regret, by,

although, the, first, printing, of, 5, 000, copies, sold, out, there, were, no, substantial, reviews, eventually, at, the, very, end, of, 1955, graham, greene, in, the, london, sunday, times, called, it, one, of, the, three, best, books, of, 1955, this, statement, provoked, a, response, from, the, london, sunday, express, whose, editor, john, gordon, called, it, the, filthiest, book, i, have, ever, read, and, sheer, unrestrained, pornography, british, customs, officers, were, then, instructed, by, the, home, office, to, seize, all, copies, entering, the, united, kingdom, in, december, 1956, france, followed, suit, and, the, minister, of, the, interior, banned, lolita, the, ban, lasted, for, two, years, its, eventual, british, publication, by, weidenfeld, nicolson, in, london, in, 1959, was, controversial, enough, to, contribute, to, the, end, of, the, political, career, of, the, conservative, member, of, parliament, nigel, nicolson, one, of, the, company, s, partners, the, novel, then, appeared, in, danish, and, dutch, translations, two, editions, of, a, swedish, translation, were, withdrawn, at, the, author, s, request, despite, initial, trepidation, there, was, no, official, response, in, the, u, s, and, the, first, american, edition, was, issued, by, g, p, putnam, s, sons, in, august, 1958, the, book, was, into, a, third, printing, within, days, and, became,

the, book, describing, it, as, dull, dull, dull, in, a, pretentious, florid, and, archly, fatuous, fashion, this, review, failed, to, influence, the, book, s, sales, and, it, is, estimated, that, lolita, had, sold, 50, million, copies, by, 2005, lolita, was, later, translated, into, russian, by, nabokov, himself, and, published, in, new, york, city, in, 1967, by, phaedra, publishers, the, novel, continues, to, generate, controversy, today, as, modern, society, has, become, increasingly, aware, of, the, lasting, damage, created, by, child, sexual, abuse, in, 2008, an, entire, book, approaches, to, teaching, nabokov, s, lolita, was, published, on, the, best, ways, to, teach, the, novel, in, a, college, classroom, given, that, its, particular, mix, of, narrative, strategies, ornate, allusive, prose, and, troublesome, subject, matter, complicates, its, presentation, to, students, in, this, book, one, author, urges, teachers, to, note, that, dolores, suffering, is, noted, in, the, book, even, if, the, main, focus, is, on, humbert, many, critics, describe, humbert, as, a, rapist, notably, azar, nafisi, in, her, best, selling, reading, lolita, in, tehran, though, in, a, survey, of, critics, elizabeth, patnoe, notes, that, other, interpreters, of, the, novel, have, been, reluctant, to, use, that, term, 133, despite, patnoe, s, observation, that, humbert, s, actions, can, only, be, interpreted, as, rape, 115, patnoe, finds, that, many, critics, sympathetically, incorporate, humbert, s, language, into, their, own, or, believe, lolita, seduces, humbert, while, emphasizing, humbert, s, responsibility, of, those, who, claim, that, humbert, rapes, lolita, patnoe, finds, that, many, go, on, to, subvert, the, claim, by, confounding, love, and, rape, 133, near, the, end, of, the, novel, humbert, states, that, had, he, been, his, own, sentencing, judge, he, would, have, given, humbert, at, least, thirty, five, years, for, rape, nabokov, biographer, brian, boyd, denies, that, it, was, rape, in, any, ordinary, sense, on, the, grounds, that, it, is, she, who, suggests, that, they, try, out, the, naughty, trick, which, she, has, already, learned, at, summer, camp, this, perspective, is, vigorously, disputed, by, peter, rabinowitz, in, his, essay, lolita, solipsized, or, sodomized, rabinowitz, argues, that, in, seeking, metaphorical, readings, and, generalized, meaning, 331, 332, academic, readers, viewing, lolita, within, the, frame, of, high, art, 327, are, standing, back, from, the, situation, a, posture, that, leads, in, this, case, to, a,

about, the, enduring, controversy, and, fascination, with, lolita, saying, this, novel, so, often, condemned, as, obscene, contains, not, a, single, explicit, phrase, but, instead, radiates, colour, and, sensuality, throughout, spinning, the, straw, of, obscenity, into, the, gold, of, rapture, perhaps, this, is, the, real, reason, for, the, outrage, that, greeted, its, publication, paedophilia, is, not, a, subject, that, should, be, linked, with, poetry, in, 2020, a, podcast, hosted, by, jamie, loftus, set, out, to, examine, the, cultural, legacy, of, the, novel, and, argued, that, depictions, and, adaptations, have, twisted, nabokov, s, original, intention, of, condemning, humbert, in, lolita, in, 1928, nabokov, wrote, a, poem, named, lilith, depicting, a, sexually, attractive, underage, girl, who, seduces, the, male, protagonist, only, to, leave, him, humiliated, in, public, in, 1939, he, wrote, a, novella, volshebnik, that, was, published, only, posthumously, in, 1986, in,

of, charlie, chaplin, joyce, milton, claims, that, a, major, inspiration, for, the, novel, was, charlie, chaplin, s, relationship, with, his, second, wife, lita, grey, whose, real, name, was, lillita,

to, the, monumental, decision, rendered, december, 6, 1933, by, hon, john, m, woolsey, in, regard, to, another, considerably, more, outspoken, book, that, is, the, decision, in, the, case, united,

comments, that, lolita, looks, like, botticelli, s, russet, venus, the, same, soft, nose, the, same, blurred, beauty, referencing, sandro, botticelli, s, depiction, of, venus, in, perhaps, the, birth, of, venus, or, venus, and, mars, in, chapter, 35, of, part, two, humbert, s, death, sentence, on, quilty, parodies, the, rhythm, and, use, of, anaphora, in, t, s, eliot, s, poem, ash, wednesday, many,

to, the, possible, prototypes, of, lewis, carroll, and, charlie, chaplin, alexander, dolinin, suggests, that, the, prototype, of, lolita, was, 11, year, old, florence, horner, kidnapped, in, 1948, by, 50, year, old, mechanic, frank, la, salle, who, had, caught, her, stealing, a, five, cent, notebook, la, salle, traveled, with, her, over, various, states, for, 21, months, and, is, believed, to, have, raped, her, he, claimed, that, he, was, an, fbi, agent, and, threatened, to, turn, her, in, for, the, theft, and, to, send, her, to, a, place, for, girls, like, you, the, horner, case, was, not, widely, reported, but, dolinin, notes, various, similarities, in, events, and, descriptions, while, nabokov, had, already, used, the, same, basic, idea, that, of, a, child, molester, and, his, victim, booking, into, a, hotel, as, father, and, daughter, in, his, then, unpublished, 1939, work, the, enchanter, he, mentions, the, horner, case, explicitly, in, chapter, 33, of, part, ii, of, lolita, had, i, done, to, dolly, perhaps, what, frank, lasalle, a, fifty, year, old, mechanic, had, done, to, eleven, year, old, sally, horner, in, 1948, german, academic, michael, maar, s, book, the, two, lolitas, describes, his, discovery, of, a, 1916, german, short, story, titled, lolita, whose, middle, aged, narrator, describes, travelling, abroad, as, a, student, he, takes, a, room, as, a, lodger, and, instantly, becomes, obsessed, with, the, preteen, girl, also, named, lolita, who, lives, in, the, same, house, maar, has, speculated, that, nabokov, may, have, had, cryptomnesia, hidden, memory, while, he, was, composing, lolita, during, the, 1950s, maar, says, that, until, 1937, nabokov, lived, in, the, same, section, of, berlin, as, the, author, heinz, von, eschwege, pen, name, heinz, von, lichberg, and, was, most, likely, familiar, with, his, work, which, was, widely, available, in, germany, during, nabokov, s, time, there, the, philadelphia, inquirer, in, the, article, lolita, at, 50, did, nabokov, take, literary, liberties, says, that, according, to, maar, accusations, of, plagiarism, should, not, apply, and, quotes, him, as, saying, literature, has, always, been, a, huge, crucible, in, which, familiar, themes, are, continually, recast, nothing, of, what, we, admire, in, lolita, is, already, to, be, found, in, the, tale, the, former, is, in, no, way, deducible, from, the, latter, see, also, jonathan, lethem, s, essay, the, ecstasy, of, influence, a, plagiarism, in, harper, s, magazine, on, this, story, in, 1956, nabokov, wrote, an, afterword, to, lolita, on, a, book, entitled, lolita, that, first, appeared, in, the, first, u, s, edition, and, has, appeared, thereafter, one, of, the, first, things, nabokov, makes, a, point, of, saying, is, that, despite, john, ray, jr, s, claim, in, the, foreword, there, is, no, moral, to, the, story, nabokov, adds, that, the, initial, shiver, of, inspiration, was, somehow, prompted, by, a, newspaper, story, about, an, ape, in, the, jardin, des, plantes, who, after, months, of, coaxing, by, a, scientist, produced, the, first, drawing, ever, charcoaled, by, an, animal, this, sketch, showed, the, bars, of, the, poor, creature, s, cage, neither, the, article, nor, the, drawing, has, been, recovered, in, response, to, an, american, critic, who, characterized, lolita, as, the, record, of, nabokov, s, love, affair, with, the, romantic, novel, nabokov, writes, that, the, substitution, of, english, language, for, romantic, novel, would, make, this, elegant, formula, more, correct, nabokov, concludes, the, afterword, with, a, reference, to, his, beloved, first, language, which, he, abandoned, as, a, writer, once, he, moved, to, the, united, states, in, 1940, my, private, tragedy, which, cannot, and, indeed, should, not, be, anybody, s, concern, is, that, i, had, to, abandon, my, natural, idiom, my, untrammeled, rich, and, infinitely, docile, russian, language, for, a, second, rate, brand, of, english, nabokov, rated, the, book, highly, in, an, interview, for, bbc, television, in, 1962, he, said, lolita, is, a, special, favorite, of, mine, it, was, my, most, difficult, book, the, book, that, treated, of, a, theme, which, was, so, distant, so, remote, from, my, own, emotional, life, that, it, gave, me, a, special, pleasure, to, use, my, combinational, talent, to, make, it, real, over, a, year, later, in, an, interview, for, playboy, he, said, no, i, shall, never, regret, lolita, she, was, like, the, composition, of, a, beautiful, puzzle, its, composition, and, its, solution, at, the, same, time, since, one, is, a, mirror, view, of, the, other, depending, on, the, way, you, look, of, course, she, completely, eclipsed, my, other, works, at, least, those, i, wrote, in, english, the, real, life, of, sebastian, knight, bend, sinister, my, short, stories, my, book, of, recollections, but, i, cannot, grudge, her, this, there, is, a, queer, tender, charm, about, that, mythical, nymphet, in, the, same, year, in, an, interview, with, life, nabokov, was, asked, which, of, his, writings, had, most, pleased, him, he, answered, i, would, say, that, of, all, my, books, lolita, has, left, me, with, the, most, pleasurable, afterglow, perhaps, because, it, is, the, purest, of, all, the, most, abstract, and, carefully, contrived, i, am, probably, responsible, for, the, odd, fact, that, people, don, t, seem, to, name, their, daughters, lolita, any, more, i, have, heard, of, young, female, poodles, being, given, that, name, since, 1956, but, of, no, human, beings, the, russian, translation, includes, a, postscriptum, in, which, nabokov, reconsiders, his, relationship, with, his, native, language, referring, to, the, afterword, in, the, english, edition, nabokov, states, that, only, the, scientific, scrupulousness, led, me, to, preserve, the, last, paragraph, of, the, american, afterword, in, the, russian, text, he, further, explains, that, the, story, of, this, translation, is, the, story, of, a, disappointment, alas, that, wonderful, russian, language, which, i, imagined, still, awaits, me, somewhere, which, blooms, like, a, faithful, spring, behind, the, locked, gate, to, which, i, after, so, many, years, still, possess, the, key, turned, out, to, be, non, existent, and, there, is, nothing, beyond, that, gate, except, for, some, burned, out, stumps, and, hopeless, autumnal, emptiness, and, the, key, in, my, hand, looks, rather, like, a, lock, pick, lolita, has, been, adapted, as, two, films, a, musical, four, stage, plays, one, completed, opera, and, two, ballets, there, is, also, nabokov, s, unfilmed, and, re, edited, screenplay, an, uncompleted, opera, based, on, the, work, and, an, imagined, opera, which, combines, elements, of, opera, and, dance
