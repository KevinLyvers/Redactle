https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthesizer
a, synthesizer, also, synthesiser, or, simply, synth, is, an, electronic, musical, instrument, that, generates, audio, signals, synthesizers, typically, create, sounds, by, generating, waveforms, through, methods, including, subtractive, synthesis, additive, synthesis, and, frequency, modulation, synthesis, these, sounds, may, be, altered, by, components, such, as, filters, which, cut, or, boost, frequencies, envelopes, which, control, articulation, or, how, notes, begin, and, end, and, low, frequency, oscillators, which, modulate, parameters, such, as, pitch, volume, or, filter, characteristics, affecting, timbre, synthesizers, are, typically, played, with, keyboards, or, controlled, by, sequencers, software, or, other, instruments, and, may, be, synchronized, to, other, equipment, via, midi, synthesizer, like, instruments, emerged, in, the, united, states, in, the, mid, 20th, century, with, instruments, such, as, the, rca, mark, ii, which, was, controlled, with, punch, cards, and, used, hundreds, of, vacuum, tubes, the, moog, synthesizer, developed, by, robert, moog, and, first, sold, in, 1964, is, credited, for, pioneering, concepts, such, as, voltage, controlled, oscillators, envelopes, noise, generators, filters, and, sequencers, in, 1970, the, smaller, cheaper, minimoog, standardized, synthesizers, as, self, contained, instruments, with, built, in, keyboards, unlike, the, larger, modular, synthesizers, before, it, in, 1978, sequential, circuits, released, the, prophet, 5, which, used, microprocessors, to, allow, users, to, store, sounds, for, the, first, time, midi, a, standardized, means, of, synchronizing, electronic, instruments, was, introduced, in, 1982, and, remains, an, industry, standard, the, yamaha, dx7, launched, in, 1983, was, a, major, success, and, popularized, digital, synthesis, software, synthesizers, now, can, be, run, as, plug, ins, or, embedded, on, microchips, in, the, 21st, century, analog, synthesizers, returned, to, popularity, with, the, advent, of, cheaper, manufacturing, synthesizers, were, initially, viewed, as, avant, garde, valued, by, the, 1960s, psychedelic, and, countercultural, scenes, but, with, little, perceived, commercial, potential, switched, on, bach, 1968, a, bestselling, album, of, bach, compositions, arranged, for, synthesizer, by, wendy, carlos, took, synthesizers, to, the, mainstream, they, were, adopted, by, electronic, acts, and, pop, and, rock, groups, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, and, were, widely, used, in, 1980s, music, sampling, introduced, with, the, fairlight, synthesizer, in, 1979, has, influenced, genres, such, as, electronic, and, hip, hop, music, today, the, synthesizer, is, used, in, nearly, every, genre, of, music, and, is, considered, one, of, the, most, important, instruments, in, the, music, industry, according, to, fact, in, 2016, the, synthesizer, is, as, important, and, as, ubiquitous, in, modern, music, today, as, the, human, voice, as, electricity, became, more, widely, available, the, early, 20th, century, saw, the, invention, of, electronic, musical, instruments, including, the, telharmonium, trautonium, ondes, martenot, and, theremin, in, the, late, 1930s, the, hammond, organ, company, built, the, novachord, a, large, instrument, powered, by, 72, voltage, controlled, amplifiers, and, 146, vacuum, tubes, in, 1948, the, canadian, engineer, hugh, le, caine, completed, the, electronic, sackbut, a, precursor, to, voltage, controlled, synthesizers, with, keyboard, sensitivity, allowing, for, vibrato, glissando, and, attack, control, in, 1957, harry, olson, and, herbert, belar, completed, the, rca, mark, ii, sound, synthesizer, at, the, rca, laboratories, in, princeton, new, jersey, the, instrument, read, punched, paper, tape, that, controlled, an, analog, synthesizer, containing, 750, vacuum, tubes, it, was, acquired, by, the, columbia, princeton, electronic, music, center, and, used, almost, exclusively, by, milton, babbitt, a, composer, at, princeton, university, the, authors, of, analog, days, define, the, early, years, of, the, synthesizer, as, between, 1964, and, the, mid, 1970s, beginning, with, the, debut, of, the, moog, synthesizer, 7, designed, by, the, american, engineer, robert, moog, the, instrument, was, a, modular, synthesizer, system, composed, of, numerous, separate, electronic, modules, each, capable, of, generating, shaping, or, controlling, a, sound, depending, on, how, each, module, is, connected, to, other, modules, by, patch, cables, moog, developed, a, means, of, controlling, pitch, through, voltage, the, voltage, controlled, oscillator, this, along, with, moog, components, such, as, envelopes, noise, generators, filters, and, sequencers, became, standard, components, in, synthesizers, around, the, same, period, the, american, engineer, don, buchla, created, the, buchla, modular, electronic, music, system, instead, of, a, conventional, keyboard, buchla, s, system, used, touchplates, which, transmitted, control, voltages, depending, on, finger, position, and, force, however, the, moog, s, keyboard, made, it, more, accessible, and, marketable, to, musicians, and, keyboards, became, the, standard, means, of, controlling, synthesizers, moog, and, buchla, initially, avoided, the, word, synthesizer, for, their, instruments, as, it, was, associated, with, the, rca, synthesizer, however, by, the, 1970s, it, had, become, the, standard, term, in, 1970, moog, launched, a, cheaper, smaller, synthesizer, the, minimoog, it, was, the, first, synthesizer, sold, in, music, stores, and, was, more, practical, for, live, performance, it, standardized, the, concept, of, synthesizers, as, self, contained, instruments, with, built, in, keyboards, in, the, early, 1970s, the, british, composer, ken, freeman, introduced, the, first, string, synthesizer, designed, to, emulate, string, sections, after, retail, stores, started, selling, synthesizers, in, 1971, other, synthesizer, companies, were, established, including, arp, in, the, us, and, ems, in, the, uk, arp, s, products, included, the, arp, 2600, which, folded, into, a, carrying, case, and, had, built, in, speakers, and, the, odyssey, a, rival, to, the, minimoog, the, less, expensive, ems, synthesizers, were, used, by, european, art, rock, and, progressive, rock, acts, including, brian, eno, and, pink, floyd, designs, for, synthesizers, appeared, in, the, amateur, electronics, market, such, as, a, design, published, in, practical, electronics, in, 1973, by, the, mid, 1970s, arp, was, the, world, s, largest, synthesizer, manufacturer, though, it, closed, in, 1981, early, synthesizers, were, monophonic, meaning, they, could, only, play, one, note, at, a, time, some, of, the, earliest, commercial, polyphonic, synthesizers, were, created, by, the, american, engineer, tom, oberheim, such, as, the, ob, x, 1979, in, 1978, the, american, company, sequential, circuits, released, the, prophet, 5, the, first, fully, programmable, polyphonic, synthesizer, 93, whereas, previous, synthesizers, required, users, to, adjust, cables, and, knobs, to, change, sounds, with, no, guarantee, of, exactly, recreating, a, sound, the, prophet, 5, used, microprocessors, to, store, sounds, in, patch, memory, this, facilitated, a, move, from, synthesizers, creating, unpredictable, sounds, to, producing, a, standard, package, of, familiar, sounds, 385, the, synthesizer, market, grew, dramatically, in, the, 1980s, 57, 1982, saw, the, introduction, of, midi, a, standardized, means, of, synchronizing, electronic, instruments, it, remains, an, industry, standard, an, influential, sampling, synthesizer, the, fairlight, cmi, was, released, in, 1979, with, the, ability, to, record, and, play, back, samples, at, different, pitches, though, its, high, price, made, it, inaccessible, to, amateurs, it, was, adopted, by, high, profile, pop, musicians, including, kate, bush, and, peter, gabriel, the, success, of, the, fairlight, drove, competition, improving, sampling, technology, and, lowering, prices, early, competing, samplers, included, the, e, mu, emulator, in, 1981, and, the, akai, s, series, in, 1985, in, 1983, yamaha, released, the, first, commercially, successful, digital, synthesizer, the, yamaha, dx7, based, on, frequency, modulation, fm, synthesis, developed, by, the, stanford, university, engineer, john, chowning, the, dx7, was, characterized, by, its, harsh, glassy, and, chilly, sounds, compared, to, the, warm, and, fuzzy, sounds, of, analog, synthesis, the, dx7, was, the, first, synthesizer, to, sell, more, than, 100, 000, units, 57, and, remains, one, of, the, bestselling, in, history, it, was, widely, used, in, 1980s, pop, music, digital, synthesizers, typically, contained, preset, sounds, emulating, acoustic, instruments, with, algorithms, controlled, with, menus, and, buttons, the, synclavier, made, with, fm, technology, licensed, from, yamaha, offered, features, such, as, 16, bit, sampling, and, digital, recording, with, a, starting, price, of, 13, 000, its, use, was, limited, to, universities, studios, and, wealthy, artists, the, roland, d, 50, 1987, blended, roland, s, linear, arithmetic, algorithm, with, samples, and, was, the, first, mass, produced, synthesizer, with, built, in, digital, effects, such, as, delay, reverb, and, chorus, 63, in, 1988, the, japanese, manufacturer, korg, released, the, m1, a, digital, synthesizer, workstation, featuring, sampled, transients, and, loops, with, more, than, 250, 000, units, sold, it, remains, the, bestselling, synthesizer, in, history, the, advent, of, digital, synthesizers, led, to, a, downturn, in, interest, in, analog, synthesizers, in, the, following, decade, 59, 1997, saw, the, release, of, rebirth, by, propellerhead, software, and, reality, by, seer, systems, the, first, software, synthesizers, that, could, be, played, in, real, time, via, midi, in, 1999, an, update, to, the, music, software, cubase, allowed, users, to, run, software, instruments, including, synthesizers, as, plug, ins, triggering, a, wave, of, new, software, instruments, propellerhead, s, reason, released, in, 2000, introduced, an, array, of, recognizable, virtual, studio, equipment, the, market, for, patchable, and, modular, synthesizers, rebounded, in, the, late, 1990s, 32, in, the, 2000s, older, analog, synthesizers, regained, popularity, sometimes, selling, for, much, more, than, their, original, prices, in, the, 2010s, new, affordable, analog, synthesizers, were, introduced, by, companies, including, moog, korg, arturia, and, dave, smith, instruments, the, renewed, interest, is, credited, to, the, appeal, of, imperfect, organic, sounds, and, simpler, interfaces, and, modern, surface, mount, technology, making, analog, synthesizers, cheaper, and, faster, to, manufacture, early, synthesizers, were, viewed, as, avant, garde, valued, by, the, 1960s, psychedelic, and, counter, cultural, scenes, for, their, ability, to, make, new, sounds, but, with, little, perceived, commercial, potential, switched, on, bach, 1968, a, bestselling, album, of, bach, compositions, arranged, for, moog, synthesizer, by, wendy, carlos, demonstrated, that, synthesizers, could, be, more, than, random, noise, machines, taking, them, to, the, mainstream, however, debates, were, held, about, the, appropriateness, of, synthesizers, in, baroque, music, and, according, to, the, guardian, they, were, quickly, abandoned, in, serious, classical, circles, today, the, synthesizer, is, one, of, the, most, important, instruments, in, the, music, industry, used, in, nearly, every, genre, 7, it, is, considered, by, the, authors, of, analog, days, as, the, only, innovation, that, can, stand, alongside, the, electric, guitar, as, a, great, new, instrument, of, the, age, of, electricity, both, led, to, new, forms, of, music, and, both, had, massive, popular, appeal, 7, according, to, fact, in, 2016, the, synthesizer, is, as, important, and, as, ubiquitous, in, modern, music, today, as, the, human, voice, the, moog, was, adopted, by, 1960s, rock, acts, including, the, doors, the, grateful, dead, the, rolling, stones, the, beatles, and, keith, emerson, emerson, was, the, first, major, rock, musician, to, perform, with, the, moog, and, it, became, a, trademark, of, his, performances, helping, take, his, band, emerson, lake, palmer, to, global, stardom, according, to, analog, days, the, likes, of, emerson, with, his, moog, performances, did, for, the, keyboard, what, jimi, hendrix, did, for, the, guitar, 200, string, synthesizers, were, used, by, 1970s, progressive, rock, bands, including, camel, caravan, electric, light, orchestra, gentle, giant, and, renaissance, the, portable, minimoog, 1970, much, smaller, than, the, modular, synthesizers, before, it, made, synthesizers, more, common, in, live, performance, early, synthesizers, could, only, play, one, note, at, a, time, making, them, suitable, for, basslines, leads, and, solos, with, the, rise, of, polyphonic, synthesizers, in, the, 70s, and, 80s, the, keyboard, in, rock, once, more, started, to, revert, to, the, background, to, be, used, for, fills, and, atmosphere, rather, than, for, soloing, 207, some, acts, felt, that, using, synthesizers, was, cheating, queen, wrote, in, their, album, liner, notes, that, they, did, not, use, them, the, minimoog, took, a, place, in, mainstream, african, american, music, most, notably, in, the, work, of, stevie, wonder, and, in, jazz, such, as, the, work, of, sun, ra, in, the, late, 1970s, and, the, early, 1980s, the, minimoog, was, widely, used, in, the, emerging, disco, genre, by, artists, including, abba, and, giorgio, moroder, sampling, introduced, with, the, fairlight, synthesizer, in, 1979, has, influenced, all, genres, of, music, and, had, a, major, influence, on, the, development, of, electronic, and, hip, hop, music, in, the, 1970s, electronic, music, composers, such, as, jean, michel, jarre, and, isao, tomita, released, successful, synthesizer, led, instrumental, albums, this, influenced, the, emergence, of, synth, pop, from, the, late, 1970s, to, the, early, 1980s, the, work, of, german, krautrock, bands, such, as, kraftwerk, and, tangerine, dream, british, acts, such, as, john, foxx, gary, numan, and, david, bowie, african, american, acts, such, as, george, clinton, and, zapp, and, japanese, electronic, acts, such, as, yellow, magic, orchestra, and, kitaro, were, influential, in, the, development, of, the, genre, the, roland, tb, 303, 1981, in, conjunction, with, the, roland, tr, 808, and, tr, 909, drum, machines, became, a, foundation, of, electronic, dance, music, genres, such, as, house, and, techno, when, producers, acquired, cheap, second, hand, units, later, in, the, decade, the, authors, of, analog, days, connect, the, synthesizer, s, origins, in, 1960s, psychedelia, to, the, raves, and, british, second, summer, of, love, of, the, 1980s, and, the, club, scenes, of, the, 1990s, and, 2000s, 321, gary, numan, s, 1979, hits, are, friends, electric, and, cars, made, heavy, use, of, synthesizers, omd, s, enola, gay, 1980, used, distinctive, electronic, percussion, and, a, synthesized, melody, soft, cell, used, a, synthesized, melody, on, their, 1981, hit, tainted, love, nick, rhodes, keyboardist, of, duran, duran, used, synthesizers, including, the, roland, jupiter, 4, and, jupiter, 8, chart, hits, include, depeche, mode, s, just, can, t, get, enough, 1981, the, human, league, s, don, t, you, want, me, and, works, by, ultravox, in, the, 1980s, digital, synthesizers, were, widely, used, in, pop, music, the, yamaha, dx7, released, in, 1983, became, a, pop, staple, used, on, songs, by, a, ha, kenny, loggins, kool, the, gang, its, e, piano, 1, preset, became, particularly, famous, especially, for, power, ballads, and, was, used, by, artists, including, whitney, houston, chicago, prince, phil, collins, luther, vandross, billy, ocean, and, celine, dion, korg, m1, presets, were, widely, used, in, 1990s, house, music, beginning, with, madonna, s, 1990, single, vogue, synthesizers, are, common, in, film, and, television, soundtracks, 273, in, 1969, mort, garson, used, a, moog, to, compose, a, soundtrack, for, the, televised, footage, of, the, apollo, 11, moonwalk, creating, a, link, between, electronic, music, and, space, in, the, american, popular, imagination, arp, synthesizers, were, used, to, create, sound, effects, for, the, 1977, science, fiction, films, close, encounters, of, the, third, kind, 9, and, star, wars, including, the, voice, of, the, robot, r2, d2, 273, in, the, 70s, and, 80s, synthesizers, were, used, in, the, scores, for, thrillers, and, horror, films, including, a, clockwork, orange, 1971, apocalypse, now, 1979, the, fog, 1980, and, manhunter, 1986, brad, fiedel, used, a, prophet, synthesizer, to, record, the, soundtrack, for, the, terminator, 1984, and, the, filmmaker, john, carpenter, used, them, extensively, for, his, soundtracks, synthesizers, were, used, to, create, themes, for, television, shows, including, knight, rider, 1982, twin, peaks, 1990, and, stranger, things, 2016, the, rise, of, the, synthesizer, led, to, major, changes, in, music, industry, jobs, comparable, to, the, earlier, arrival, of, sound, in, film, which, put, live, musicians, accompanying, silent, films, out, of, work, with, its, ability, to, imitate, instruments, such, as, strings, and, horns, the, synthesizer, threatened, the, jobs, of, session, musicians, for, a, period, the, moog, was, banned, from, use, in, commercial, work, a, restriction, negotiated, by, the, american, federation, of, musicians, afm, robert, moog, felt, that, the, afm, had, not, realized, that, his, instrument, had, to, be, studied, like, any, other, and, instead, imagined, that, all, the, sounds, that, musicians, could, make, somehow, existed, in, the, moog, all, you, had, to, do, was, push, a, button, that, said, jascha, heifetz, and, out, would, come, the, most, fantastic, violin, player, the, musician, walter, sear, persuaded, the, afm, that, the, synthesizer, demanded, skill, and, the, category, of, synthesizer, player, was, accepted, into, the, union, however, players, were, subject, to, suspicion, and, hostility, for, years, 149, in, 1982, following, a, tour, by, barry, manilow, using, synthesizers, instead, of, an, orchestra, the, british, musicians, union, attempted, to, ban, synthesizers, attracting, controversy, that, decade, a, few, musicians, skilled, at, programming, the, yamaha, dx7, found, employment, creating, sounds, for, other, acts, synthesizers, generate, audio, through, various, forms, of, analog, and, digital, synthesis, oscillators, produce, waveforms, such, as, sawtooth, sine, or, pulse, waves, with, different, timbres, voltage, controlled, amplifiers, vcas, control, the, volume, or, gain, of, the, audio, signal, vcas, can, be, modulated, by, other, components, such, as, lfos, and, envelopes, a, vca, is, a, preamp, that, boosts, amplifies, the, electronic, signal, before, passing, it, on, to, an, external, or, built, in, power, amplifier, as, well, as, a, means, to, control, its, amplitude, volume, using, an, attenuator, the, gain, of, the, vca, is, affected, by, a, control, voltage, cv, coming, from, an, envelope, generator, an, lfo, the, keyboard, or, some, other, source, voltage, controlled, filters, vcfs, shape, the, sound, generated, by, the, oscillators, in, the, frequency, domain, often, under, the, control, of, an, envelope, or, lfo, these, are, essential, to, subtractive, synthesis, filters, are, particularly, important, in, subtractive, synthesis, being, designed, to, pass, some, frequency, regions, or, bands, through, unattenuated, while, significantly, attenuating, subtracting, others, the, low, pass, filter, is, most, frequently, used, but, band, pass, filters, band, reject, filters, and, high, pass, filters, are, also, sometimes, available, the, filter, may, be, controlled, with, a, second, adsr, envelope, an, envelope, modulation, env, mod, parameter, on, many, synthesizers, with, filter, envelopes, determines, how, much, the, envelope, affects, the, filter, if, turned, all, the, way, down, the, filter, produces, a, flat, sound, with, no, envelope, when, turned, up, the, envelope, becomes, more, noticeable, expanding, the, minimum, and, maximum, range, of, the, filter, the, envelope, applied, on, the, filter, helps, the, sound, designer, generating, long, notes, or, short, notes, by, moving, the, parameters, up, and, down, such, as, decay, sustain, and, finally, release, for, instance, by, using, a, short, decay, with, no, sustain, the, sound, generated, is, commonly, known, as, a, stab, sound, designers, may, prefer, shaping, the, sound, with, a, filter, instead, of, volume, envelopes, control, how, sounds, change, over, time, they, may, control, parameters, such, as, amplitude, volume, filters, frequencies, or, pitch, the, most, common, envelope, is, the, adsr, attack, decay, sustain, release, envelope, low, frequency, oscillators, lfos, produce, waveforms, used, to, modulate, parameters, such, as, the, pitch, of, oscillators, producing, vibrato, arpeggiators, included, in, many, synthesizer, models, take, input, chords, and, convert, them, into, arpeggios, they, usually, include, controls, for, speed, range, and, mode, the, movement, of, the, arpeggio, synthesizers, are, often, controlled, with, electronic, or, digital, keyboards, or, midi, controller, keyboards, which, may, be, built, into, the, synthesizer, unit, or, attached, via, connections, such, as, cv, gate, usb, or, midi, keyboards, may, offer, expression, such, as, velocity, sensitivity, and, aftertouch, allowing, for, more, control, over, the, sound, other, controllers, include, ribbon, controllers, which, track, the, movement, of, the, finger, across, a, touch, sensitive, surface, wind, controllers, played, similarly, to, woodwind, instruments, motion, sensitive, controllers, similar, to, video, game, motion, controllers, electronic, drum, pads, played, similarly, to, the, heads, of, a, drum, kit, touchplates, which, send, signals, depending, on, finger, position, and, force, controllers, designed, for, microtonal, tunings, touchscreen, devices, such, as, tablets, and, smartphones, and, fingerpads, synthesizer, clones, are, unlicensed, recreations, of, previous, synthesizers, often, marketed, as, affordable, versions, of, famous, musical, equipment, clones, are, available, as, physical, instruments, and, software, companies, that, have, sold, software, clones, include, arturia, and, native, instruments, behringer, manufactures, equipment, modelled, on, instruments, including, the, minimoog, pro, one, and, tb, 303, and, drum, machines, such, as, the, tr, 808, other, synthesizer, clones, include, the, minimod, a, series, of, eurorack, modules, based, on, the, minimoog, the, intellijel, atlantis, based, on, the, sh, 101, and, the, x0x, heart, based, on, the, tb, 303, creating, clones, of, older, hardware, is, legal, where, the, patents, have,
