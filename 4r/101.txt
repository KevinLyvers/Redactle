time, travel, is, the, hypothetical, activity, of, traveling, into, the, past, or, future, time, travel, is, a, widely, recognized, concept, in, philosophy, and, fiction, particularly, science, fiction, in, fiction, time, travel, is, typically, achieved, through, the, use, of, a, hypothetical, device, known, as, a, time, machine, the, idea, of, a, time, machine, was, popularized, by, h, g, wells, s, 1895, novel, the, time, machine, it, is, uncertain, whether, time, travel, to, the, past, would, be, physically, possible, such, travel, if, at, all, feasible, may, give, rise, to, questions, of, causality, forward, time, travel, outside, the, usual, sense, of, the, perception, of, time, is, an, extensively, observed, phenomenon, and, is, well, understood, within, the, framework, of, special, relativity, and, general, relativity, however, making, one, body, advance, or, delay, more, than, a, few, milliseconds, compared, to, another, body, is, not, feasible, with, current, technology, as, for, backward, time, travel, it, is, possible, to, find, solutions, in, general, relativity, that, allow, for, it, such, as, a, rotating, black, hole, traveling, to, an, arbitrary, point, in, spacetime, has, very, limited, support, in, theoretical, physics, and, is, usually, connected, only, with, quantum, mechanics, or, wormholes, some, ancient, myths, depict, a, character, skipping, forward, in, time, in, hindu, mythology, the, vishnu, purana, mentions, the, story, of, king, raivata, kakudmi, who, travels, to, heaven, to, meet, the, creator, brahma, and, is, surprised, to, learn, when, he, returns, to, earth, that, many, ages, have, passed, the, buddhist, p, li, canon, mentions, the, relativity, of, time, the, payasi, sutta, tells, of, one, of, the, buddha, s, chief, disciples, kumara, kassapa, who, explains, to, the, skeptic, payasi, that, time, in, the, heavens, passes, differently, than, on, earth, the, japanese, tale, of, urashima, tar, first, described, in, the, manyoshu, tells, of, a, young, fisherman, named, urashima, no, ko, who, visits, an, undersea, palace, after, three, days, he, returns, home, to, his, village, and, finds, himself, 300, years, in, the, future, where, he, has, been, forgotten, his, house, is, in, ruins, and, his, family, has, died, in, jewish, tradition, the, 1st, century, bc, scholar, honi, ha, m, agel, is, said, to, have, fallen, asleep, and, slept, for, seventy, years, when, waking, up, he, returned, home, but, found, none, of, the, people, he, knew, and, no, one, believed, his, claims, of, who, he, was, in, islam, the, quran, narrates, the, story, of, the, seven, sleepers, a, group, of, monotheistic, young, men, who, sought, refuge, in, a, cave, to, escape, persecution, as, they, slept, allah, preserved, them, for, centuries, and, when, they, awoke, they, discovered, a, changed, world, this, narrative, found, in, the, quranic, surah, al, kahf, describes, divine, protection, and, time, suspension, the, story, of, the, seven, sleepers, appears, in, a, myth, of, the, christian, religion, in, which, a, group, of, young, men, were, seeking, to, escape, roman, persecution, rome, was, a, polytheistic, empire, at, the, time, in, another, story, from, islam, uzair, often, identified, with, the, biblical, ezra, experienced, profound, grief, at, the, babylonian, destruction, of, jerusalem, it, is, said, that, god, took, his, soul, and, restored, him, to, life, after, the, city, s, reconstruction, upon, returning, to, his, hometown, he, went, unrecognized, by, the, people, and, his, household, except, for, an, elderly, maid, who, once, blind, regained, her, sight, through, his, prayers, during, this, reunion, uzair, also, encountered, his, son, who, despite, aging, beyond, him, recognized, his, father, time, travel, themes, in, science, fiction, and, the, media, can, be, grouped, into, three, categories, immutable, timeline, mutable, timeline, and, alternate, histories, as, in, the, interacting, many, worlds, interpretation, the, non, scientific, term, timeline, is, often, used, to, refer, to, all, physical, events, in, history, so, that, where, events, are, changed, the, time, traveler, is, described, as, creating, a, new, timeline, early, science, fiction, stories, feature, characters, who, sleep, for, years, and, awaken, in, a, changed, society, or, are, transported, to, the, past, through, supernatural, means, among, them, l, an, 2440, r, ve, s, il, en, f, t, jamais, the, year, 2440, a, dream, if, ever, there, was, one, 1770, by, louis, s, bastien, mercier, rip, van, winkle, 1819, by, washington, irving, looking, backward, 1888, by, edward, bellamy, and, when, the, sleeper, awakes, 1899, by, h, g, wells, prolonged, sleep, like, the, later, more, familiar, time, machine, is, used, as, a, means, of, time, travel, in, these, stories, the, date, of, the, earliest, work, about, backwards, time, travel, is, uncertain, the, chinese, novel, supplement, to, the, journey, to, the, west, c, 1640, by, dong, yue, features, magical, mirrors, and, jade, gateways, that, connect, various, points, in, time, the, protagonist, sun, wukong, travels, back, in, time, to, the, world, of, the, ancients, qin, dynasty, to, retrieve, a, magical, bell, and, then, travels, forward, to, the, world, of, the, future, song, dynasty, to, find, an, emperor, who, has, been, exiled, in, time, however, the, time, travel, is, taking, place, inside, an, illusory, dream, world, created, by, the, villain, to, distract, and, entrap, him, samuel, madden, s, memoirs, of, the, twentieth, century, 1733, is, a, series, of, letters, from, british, ambassadors, in, 1997, and, 1998, to, diplomats, in, the, past, conveying, the, political, and, religious, conditions, of, the, future, 95, 96, because, the, narrator, receives, these, letters, from, his, guardian, angel, paul, alkon, suggests, in, his, book, origins, of, futuristic, fiction, that, the, first, time, traveler, in, english, literature, is, a, guardian, angel, 85, madden, does, not, explain, how, the, angel, obtains, these, documents, but, alkon, asserts, that, madden, deserves, recognition, as, the, first, to, toy, with, the, rich, idea, of, time, travel, in, the, form, of, an, artifact, sent, backward, from, the, future, to, be, discovered, in, the, present, 95, 96, in, the, science, fiction, anthology, far, boundaries, 1951, editor, august, derleth, claims, that, an, early, short, story, about, time, travel, is, an, anachronism, or, missing, one, s, coach, written, for, the, dublin, literary, magazine, by, an, anonymous, author, in, the, june, 1838, issue, 3, while, the, narrator, waits, under, a, tree, for, a, coach, to, take, him, out, of, newcastle, upon, tyne, he, is, transported, back, in, time, over, a, thousand, years, he, encounters, the, venerable, bede, in, a, monastery, and, explains, to, him, the, developments, of, the, coming, centuries, however, the, story, never, makes, it, clear, whether, these, events, are, real, or, a, dream, 11, 38, another, early, work, about, time, travel, is, the, forebears, of, kalimeros, alexander, son, of, philip, of, macedon, by, alexander, veltman, published, in, 1836, charles, dickens, s, a, christmas, carol, 1843, has, early, depictions, of, mystical, time, travel, in, both, directions, as, the, protagonist, ebenezer, scrooge, is, transported, to, christmases, past, and, future, other, stories, employ, the, same, template, where, a, character, naturally, goes, to, sleep, and, upon, waking, up, finds, him, or, her, self, in, a, different, time, a, clearer, example, of, backward, time, travel, is, found, in, the, popular, 1861, book, paris, avant, les, hommes, paris, before, men, by, the, french, botanist, and, geologist, pierre, boitard, published, posthumously, in, this, story, the, protagonist, is, transported, to, the, prehistoric, past, by, the, magic, of, a, lame, demon, a, french, pun, on, boitard, s, name, where, he, encounters, a, plesiosaur, and, an, apelike, ancestor, and, is, able, to, interact, with, ancient, creatures, edward, everett, hale, s, hands, off, 1881, tells, the, story, of, an, unnamed, being, possibly, the, soul, of, a, person, who, has, recently, died, who, interferes, with, ancient, egyptian, history, by, preventing, joseph, s, enslavement, this, may, have, been, the, first, story, to, feature, an, alternate, history, created, as, a, result, of, time, travel, 54, one, of, the, first, stories, to, feature, time, travel, by, means, of, a, machine, is, the, clock, that, went, backward, by, edward, page, mitchell, which, appeared, in, the, new, york, sun, in, 1881, however, the, mechanism, borders, on, fantasy, an, unusual, clock, when, wound, runs, backwards, and, transports, people, nearby, back, in, time, the, author, does, not, explain, the, origin, or, properties, of, the, clock, 55, enrique, gaspar, y, rimbau, s, el, anacron, pete, 1887, may, have, been, the, first, story, to, feature, a, vessel, engineered, to, travel, through, time, andrew, sawyer, has, commented, that, the, story, does, seem, to, be, the, first, literary, description, of, a, time, machine, noted, so, far, adding, that, edward, page, mitchell, s, story, the, clock, that, went, backward, 1881, is, usually, described, as, the, first, time, machine, story, but, i, m, not, sure, that, a, clock, quite, counts, h, g, wells, the, time, machine, 1895, popularized, the, concept, of, time, travel, by, mechanical, means, some, theories, most, notably, special, and, general, relativity, suggest, that, suitable, geometries, of, spacetime, or, specific, types, of, motion, in, space, might, allow, time, travel, into, the, past, and, future, if, these, geometries, or, motions, were, possible, 499, in, technical, papers, physicists, discuss, the, possibility, of, closed, timelike, curves, which, are, world, lines, that, form, closed, loops, in, spacetime, allowing, objects, to, return, to, their, own, past, there, are, known, to, be, solutions, to, the, equations, of, general, relativity, that, describe, spacetimes, which, contain, closed, timelike, curves, such, as, g, del, spacetime, but, the, physical, plausibility, of, these, solutions, is, uncertain, many, in, the, scientific, community, believe, that, backward, time, travel, is, highly, unlikely, to, be, possible, any, theory, that, would, allow, time, travel, would, introduce, potential, problems, of, causality, the, classic, example, of, a, problem, involving, causality, is, the, grandfather, paradox, which, postulates, travelling, to, the, past, and, intervening, in, the, conception, of, one, s, ancestors, causing, the, death, of, an, ancestor, before, conception, being, frequently, cited, some, physicists, such, as, novikov, and, deutsch, suggested, that, these, sorts, of, temporal, paradoxes, can, be, avoided, through, the, novikov, self, consistency, principle, or, a, variation, of, the, many, worlds, interpretation, with, interacting, worlds, time, travel, to, the, past, is, theoretically, possible, in, certain, general, relativity, spacetime, geometries, that, permit, traveling, faster, than, the, speed, of, light, such, as, cosmic, strings, traversable, wormholes, and, alcubierre, drives, 33, 130, the, theory, of, general, relativity, does, suggest, a, scientific, basis, for, the, possibility, of, backward, time, travel, in, certain, unusual, scenarios, although, arguments, from, semiclassical, gravity, suggest, that, when, quantum, effects, are, incorporated, into, general, relativity, these, loopholes, may, be, closed, these, semiclassical, arguments, led, stephen, hawking, to, formulate, the, chronology, protection, conjecture, suggesting, that, the, fundamental, laws, of, nature, prevent, time, travel, but, physicists, cannot, come, to, a, definitive, judgment, on, the, issue, without, a, theory, of, quantum, gravity, to, join, quantum, mechanics, and, general, relativity, into, a, completely, unified, theory, 150, the, theory, of, general, relativity, describes, the, universe, under, a, system, of, field, equations, that, determine, the, metric, or, distance, function, of, spacetime, there, exist, exact, solutions, to, these, equations, that, include, closed, time, like, curves, which, are, world, lines, that, intersect, themselves, some, point, in, the, causal, future, of, the, world, line, is, also, in, its, causal, past, a, situation, that, can, be, described, as, time, travel, such, a, solution, was, first, proposed, by, kurt, g, del, a, solution, known, as, the, g, del, metric, but, his, and, others, solution, requires, the, universe, to, have, physical, characteristics, that, it, does, not, appear, to, have, 499, such, as, rotation, and, lack, of, hubble, expansion, whether, general, relativity, forbids, closed, time, like, curves, for, all, realistic, conditions, is, still, being, researched, wormholes, are, a, hypothetical, warped, spacetime, permitted, by, the, einstein, field, equations, of, general, relativity, 100, a, proposed, time, travel, machine, using, a, traversable, wormhole, would, hypothetically, work, in, the, following, way, one, end, of, the, wormhole, is, accelerated, to, some, significant, fraction, of, the, speed, of, light, perhaps, with, some, advanced, propulsion, system, and, then, brought, back, to, the, point, of, origin, alternatively, another, way, is, to, take, one, entrance, of, the, wormhole, and, move, it, to, within, the, gravitational, field, of, an, object, that, has, higher, gravity, than, the, other, entrance, and, then, return, it, to, a, position, near, the, other, entrance, for, both, these, methods, time, dilation, causes, the, end, of, the, wormhole, that, has, been, moved, to, have, aged, less, or, become, younger, than, the, stationary, end, as, seen, by, an, external, observer, however, time, connects, differently, through, the, wormhole, than, outside, it, so, that, synchronized, clocks, at, either, end, of, the, wormhole, will, always, remain, synchronized, as, seen, by, an, observer, passing, through, the, wormhole, no, matter, how, the, two, ends, move, around, 502, this, means, that, an, observer, entering, the, younger, end, would, exit, the, older, end, at, a, time, when, it, was, the, same, age, as, the, younger, end, effectively, going, back, in, time, as, seen, by, an, observer, from, the, outside, one, significant, limitation, of, such, a, time, machine, is, that, it, is, only, possible, to, go, as, far, back, in, time, as, the, initial, creation, of, the, machine, 503, in, essence, it, is, more, of, a, path, through, time, than, it, is, a, device, that, itself, moves, through, time, and, it, would, not, allow, the, technology, itself, to, be, moved, backward, in, time, according, to, current, theories, on, the, nature, of, wormholes, construction, of, a, traversable, wormhole, would, require, the, existence, of, a, substance, with, negative, energy, often, referred, to, as, exotic, matter, more, technically, the, wormhole, spacetime, requires, a, distribution, of, energy, that, violates, various, energy, conditions, such, as, the, null, energy, condition, along, with, the, weak, strong, and, dominant, energy, conditions, however, it, is, known, that, quantum, effects, can, lead, to, small, measurable, violations, of, the, null, energy, condition, 101, and, many, physicists, believe, that, the, required, negative, energy, may, actually, be, possible, due, to, the, casimir, effect, in, quantum, physics, although, early, calculations, suggested, that, a, very, large, amount, of, negative, energy, would, be, required, later, calculations, showed, that, the, amount, of, negative, energy, can, be, made, arbitrarily, small, in, 1993, matt, visser, argued, that, the, two, mouths, of, a, wormhole, with, such, an, induced, clock, difference, could, not, be, brought, together, without, inducing, quantum, field, and, gravitational, effects, that, would, either, make, the, wormhole, collapse, or, the, two, mouths, repel, each, other, because, of, this, the, two, mouths, could, not, be, brought, close, enough, for, causality, violation, to, take, place, however, in, a, 1997, paper, visser, hypothesized, that, a, complex, roman, ring, named, after, tom, roman, configuration, of, an, n, number, of, wormholes, arranged, in, a, symmetric, polygon, could, still, act, as, a, time, machine, although, he, concludes, that, this, is, more, likely, a, flaw, in, classical, quantum, gravity, theory, rather, than, proof, that, causality, violation, is, possible, another, approach, involves, a, dense, spinning, cylinder, usually, referred, to, as, a, tipler, cylinder, a, gr, solution, discovered, by, willem, jacob, van, stockum, in, 1936, and, kornel, lanczos, in, 1924, but, not, recognized, as, allowing, closed, timelike, curves, 21, until, an, analysis, by, frank, tipler, in, 1974, if, a, cylinder, is, infinitely, long, and, spins, fast, enough, about, its, long, axis, then, a, spaceship, flying, around, the, cylinder, on, a, spiral, path, could, travel, back, in, time, or, forward, depending, on, the, direction, of, its, spiral, however, the, density, and, speed, required, is, so, great, that, ordinary, matter, is, not, strong, enough, to, construct, it, physicist, ronald, mallett, is, attempting, to, recreate, the, conditions, of, a, rotating, black, hole, with, ring, lasers, in, order, to, bend, spacetime, and, allow, for, time, travel, a, more, fundamental, objection, to, time, travel, schemes, based, on, rotating, cylinders, or, cosmic, strings, has, been, put, forward, by, stephen, hawking, who, proved, a, theorem, showing, that, according, to, general, relativity, it, is, impossible, to, build, a, time, machine, of, a, special, type, a, time, machine, with, the, compactly, generated, cauchy, horizon, in, a, region, where, the, weak, energy, condition, is, satisfied, meaning, that, the, region, contains, no, matter, with, negative, energy, density, exotic, matter, solutions, such, as, tipler, s, assume, cylinders, of, infinite, length, which, are, easier, to, analyze, mathematically, and, although, tipler, suggested, that, a, finite, cylinder, might, produce, closed, timelike, curves, if, the, rotation, rate, were, fast, enough, 169, he, did, not, prove, this, but, hawking, points, out, that, because, of, his, theorem, it, can, t, be, done, with, positive, energy, density, everywhere, i, can, prove, that, to, build, a, finite, time, machine, you, need, negative, energy, 96, this, result, comes, from, hawking, s, 1992, paper, on, the, chronology, protection, conjecture, which, hawking, states, as, the, laws, of, physics, do, not, allow, the, appearance, of, closed, timelike, curves, when, a, signal, is, sent, from, one, location, and, received, at, another, location, then, as, long, as, the, signal, is, moving, at, the, speed, of, light, or, slower, the, mathematics, of, simultaneity, in, the, theory, of, relativity, show, that, all, reference, frames, agree, that, the, transmission, event, happened, before, the, reception, event, when, the, signal, travels, faster, than, light, it, is, received, before, it, is, sent, in, all, reference, frames, the, signal, could, be, said, to, have, moved, backward, in, time, this, hypothetical, scenario, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, a, tachyonic, antitelephone, quantum, mechanical, phenomena, such, as, quantum, teleportation, the, epr, paradox, or, quantum, entanglement, might, appear, to, create, a, mechanism, that, allows, for, faster, than, light, ftl, communication, or, time, travel, and, in, fact, some, interpretations, of, quantum, mechanics, such, as, the, bohm, interpretation, presume, that, some, information, is, being, exchanged, between, particles, instantaneously, in, order, to, maintain, correlations, between, particles, this, effect, was, referred, to, as, spooky, action, at, a, distance, by, einstein, nevertheless, the, fact, that, causality, is, preserved, in, quantum, mechanics, is, a, rigorous, result, in, modern, quantum, field, theories, and, therefore, modern, theories, do, not, allow, for, time, travel, or, ftl, communication, in, any, specific, instance, where, ftl, has, been, claimed, more, detailed, analysis, has, proven, that, to, get, a, signal, some, form, of, classical, communication, must, also, be, used, the, no, communication, theorem, also, gives, a, general, proof, that, quantum, entanglement, cannot, be, used, to, transmit, information, faster, than, classical, signals, a, variation, of, hugh, everett, s, many, worlds, interpretation, mwi, of, quantum, mechanics, provides, a, resolution, to, the, grandfather, paradox, that, involves, the, time, traveler, arriving, in, a, different, universe, than, the, one, they, came, from, it, s, been, argued, that, since, the, traveler, arrives, in, a, different, universe, s, history, and, not, their, own, history, this, is, not, genuine, time, travel, the, accepted, many, worlds, interpretation, suggests, that, all, possible, quantum, events, can, occur, in, mutually, exclusive, histories, however, some, variations, allow, different, universes, to, interact, this, concept, is, most, often, used, in, science, fiction, but, some, physicists, such, as, david, deutsch, have, suggested, that, a, time, traveler, should, end, up, in, a, different, history, than, the, one, he, started, from, on, the, other, hand, stephen, hawking, has, argued, that, even, if, the, mwi, is, correct, we, should, expect, each, time, traveler, to, experience, a, single, self, consistent, history, so, that, time, travelers, remain, within, their, own, world, rather, than, traveling, to, a, different, one, the, physicist, allen, everett, argued, that, deutsch, s, approach, involves, modifying, fundamental, principles, of, quantum, mechanics, it, certainly, goes, beyond, simply, adopting, the, mwi, everett, also, argues, that, even, if, deutsch, s, approach, is, correct, it, would, imply, that, any, macroscopic, object, composed, of, multiple, particles, would, be, split, apart, when, traveling, back, in, time, through, a, wormhole, with, different, particles, emerging, in, different, worlds, certain, experiments, carried, out, give, the, impression, of, reversed, causality, but, fail, to, show, it, under, closer, examination, the, delayed, choice, quantum, eraser, experiment, performed, by, marlan, scully, involves, pairs, of, entangled, photons, that, are, divided, into, signal, photons, and, idler, photons, with, the, signal, photons, emerging, from, one, of, two, locations, and, their, position, later, measured, as, in, the, double, slit, experiment, depending, on, how, the, idler, photon, is, measured, the, experimenter, can, either, learn, which, of, the, two, locations, the, signal, photon, emerged, from, or, erase, that, information, even, though, the, signal, photons, can, be, measured, before, the, choice, has, been, made, about, the, idler, photons, the, choice, seems, to, retroactively, determine, whether, or, not, an, interference, pattern, is, observed, when, one, correlates, measurements, of, idler, photons, to, the, corresponding, signal, photons, however, since, interference, can, be, observed, only, after, the, idler, photons, are, measured, and, they, are, correlated, with, the, signal, photons, there, is, no, way, for, experimenters, to, tell, what, choice, will, be, made, in, advance, just, by, looking, at, the, signal, photons, only, by, gathering, classical, information, from, the, entire, system, thus, causality, is, preserved, the, experiment, of, lijun, wang, might, also, show, causality, violation, since, it, made, it, possible, to, send, packages, of, waves, through, a, bulb, of, caesium, gas, in, such, a, way, that, the, package, appeared, to, exit, the, bulb, 62, nanoseconds, before, its, entry, but, a, wave, package, is, not, a, single, well, defined, object, but, rather, a, sum, of, multiple, waves, of, different, frequencies, see, fourier, analysis, and, the, package, can, appear, to, move, faster, than, light, or, even, backward, in, time, even, if, none, of, the, pure, waves, in, the, sum, do, so, this, effect, cannot, be, used, to, send, any, matter, energy, or, information, faster, than, light, so, this, experiment, is, understood, not, to, violate, causality, either, the, physicists, g, nter, nimtz, and, alfons, stahlhofen, of, the, university, of, koblenz, claim, to, have, violated, einstein, s, theory, of, relativity, by, transmitting, photons, faster, than, the, speed, of, light, they, say, they, have, conducted, an, experiment, in, which, microwave, photons, traveled, instantaneously, between, a, pair, of, prisms, that, had, been, moved, up, to, 3, ft, 0, 91, m, apart, using, a, phenomenon, known, as, quantum, tunneling, nimtz, told, new, scientist, magazine, for, the, time, being, this, is, the, only, violation, of, special, relativity, that, i, know, of, however, other, physicists, say, that, this, phenomenon, does, not, allow, information, to, be, transmitted, faster, than, light, aephraim, m, steinberg, a, quantum, optics, expert, at, the, university, of, toronto, canada, uses, the, analogy, of, a, train, traveling, from, chicago, to, new, york, but, dropping, off, train, cars, at, each, station, along, the, way, so, that, the, center, of, the, train, moves, forward, at, each, stop, in, this, way, the, speed, of, the, center, of, the, train, exceeds, the, speed, of, any, of, the, individual, cars, shengwang, du, claims, in, a, peer, reviewed, journal, to, have, observed, single, photons, precursors, saying, that, they, travel, no, faster, than, c, in, a, vacuum, his, experiment, involved, slow, light, as, well, as, passing, light, through, a, vacuum, he, generated, two, single, photons, passing, one, through, rubidium, atoms, that, had, been, cooled, with, a, laser, thus, slowing, the, light, and, passing, one, through, a, vacuum, both, times, apparently, the, precursors, preceded, the, photons, main, bodies, and, the, precursor, traveled, at, c, in, a, vacuum, according, to, du, this, implies, that, there, is, no, possibility, of, light, traveling, faster, than, c, and, thus, no, possibility, of, violating, causality, many, have, argued, that, the, absence, of, time, travelers, from, the, future, demonstrates, that, such, technology, will, never, be, developed, suggesting, that, it, is, impossible, this, is, analogous, to, the, fermi, paradox, related, to, the, absence, of, evidence, of, extraterrestrial, life, as, the, absence, of, extraterrestrial, visitors, does, not, categorically, prove, they, do, not, exist, so, the, absence, of, time, travelers, fails, to, prove, time, travel, is, physically, impossible, it, might, be, that, time, travel, is, physically, possible, but, is, never, developed, or, is, cautiously, used, carl, sagan, once, suggested, the, possibility, that, time, travelers, could, be, here, but, are, disguising, their, existence, or, are, not, recognized, as, time, travelers, some, versions, of, general, relativity, suggest, that, time, travel, might, only, be, possible, in, a, region, of, spacetime, that, is, warped, a, certain, way, and, hence, time, travelers, would, not, be, able, to, travel, back, to, earlier, regions, in, spacetime, before, this, region, existed, stephen, hawking, stated, that, this, would, explain, why, the, world, has, not, already, been, overrun, by, tourists, from, the, future, several, experiments, have, been, carried, out, to, try, to, entice, future, humans, who, might, invent, time, travel, technology, to, come, back, and, demonstrate, it, to, people, of, the, present, time, events, such, as, perth, s, destination, day, or, mit, s, time, traveler, convention, heavily, publicized, permanent, advertisements, of, a, meeting, time, and, place, for, future, time, travelers, to, meet, in, 1982, a, group, in, baltimore, maryland, identifying, itself, as, the, krononauts, hosted, an, event, of, this, type, welcoming, visitors, from, the, future, these, experiments, only, stood, the, possibility, of, generating, a, positive, result, demonstrating, the, existence, of, time, travel, but, have, failed, so, far, no, time, travelers, are, known, to, have, attended, either, event, some, versions, of, the, many, worlds, interpretation, can, be, used, to, suggest, that, future, humans, have, traveled, back, in, time, but, have, traveled, back, to, the, meeting, time, and, place, in, a, parallel, universe, there, is, a, great, deal, of, observable, evidence, for, time, dilation, in, special, relativity, and, gravitational, time, dilation, in, general, relativity, for, example, in, the, famous, and, easy, to, replicate, observation, of, atmospheric, muon, decay, the, theory, of, relativity, states, that, the, speed, of, light, is, invariant, for, all, observers, in, any, frame, of, reference, that, is, it, is, always, the, same, time, dilation, is, a, direct, consequence, of, the, invariance, of, the, speed, of, light, time, dilation, may, be, regarded, in, a, limited, sense, as, time, travel, into, the, future, a, person, may, use, time, dilation, so, that, a, small, amount, of, proper, time, passes, for, them, while, a, large, amount, of, proper, time, passes, elsewhere, this, can, be, achieved, by, traveling, at, relativistic, speeds, or, through, the, effects, of, gravity, for, two, identical, clocks, moving, relative, to, each, other, without, accelerating, each, clock, measures, the, other, to, be, ticking, slower, this, is, possible, due, to, the, relativity, of, simultaneity, however, the, symmetry, is, broken, if, one, clock, accelerates, allowing, for, less, proper, time, to, pass, for, one, clock, than, the, other, the, twin, paradox, describes, this, one, twin, remains, on, earth, while, the, other, undergoes, acceleration, to, relativistic, speed, as, they, travel, into, space, turn, around, and, travel, back, to, earth, the, traveling, twin, ages, less, than, the, twin, who, stayed, on, earth, because, of, the, time, dilation, experienced, during, their, acceleration, general, relativity, treats, the, effects, of, acceleration, and, the, effects, of, gravity, as, equivalent, and, shows, that, time, dilation, also, occurs, in, gravity, wells, with, a, clock, deeper, in, the, well, ticking, more, slowly, this, effect, is, taken, into, account, when, calibrating, the, clocks, on, the, satellites, of, the, global, positioning, system, and, it, could, lead, to, significant, differences, in, rates, of, aging, for, observers, at, different, distances, from, a, large, gravity, well, such, as, a, black, hole, 33, 130, a, time, machine, that, utilizes, this, principle, might, be, for, instance, a, spherical, shell, with, a, diameter, of, five, meters, and, the, mass, of, jupiter, a, person, at, its, center, will, travel, forward, in, time, at, a, rate, four, times, slower, than, that, of, distant, observers, squeezing, the, mass, of, a, large, planet, into, such, a, small, structure, is, not, expected, to, be, within, humanity, s, technological, capabilities, in, the, near, future, 76, 140, with, current, technologies, it, is, only, possible, to, cause, a, human, traveler, to, age, less, than, companions, on, earth, by, a, few, milliseconds, after, a, few, hundred, days, of, space, travel, philosophers, have, discussed, the, philosophy, of, space, and, time, since, at, least, the, time, of, ancient, greece, for, example, parmenides, presented, the, view, that, time, is, an, illusion, centuries, later, isaac, newton, supported, the, idea, of, absolute, time, while, his, contemporary, gottfried, wilhelm, leibniz, maintained, that, time, is, only, a, relation, between, events, and, it, cannot, be, expressed, independently, the, latter, approach, eventually, gave, rise, to, the, spacetime, of, relativity, many, philosophers, have, argued, that, relativity, implies, eternalism, the, idea, that, the, past, and, future, exist, in, a, real, sense, not, only, as, changes, that, occurred, or, will, occur, to, the, present, philosopher, of, science, dean, rickles, disagrees, with, some, qualifications, but, notes, that, the, consensus, among, philosophers, seems, to, be, that, special, and, general, relativity, are, incompatible, with, presentism, some, philosophers, view, time, as, a, dimension, equal, to, spatial, dimensions, that, future, events, are, already, there, in, the, same, sense, different, places, exist, and, that, there, is, no, objective, flow, of, time, however, this, view, is, disputed, presentism, is, a, school, of, philosophy, that, holds, that, the, future, and, the, past, exist, only, as, changes, that, occurred, or, will, occur, to, the, present, and, they, have, no, real, existence, of, their, own, in, this, view, time, travel, is, impossible, because, there, is, no, future, or, past, to, travel, to, keller, and, nelson, have, argued, that, even, if, past, and, future, objects, do, not, exist, there, can, still, be, definite, truths, about, past, and, future, events, and, thus, it, is, possible, that, a, future, truth, about, a, time, traveler, deciding, to, travel, back, to, the, present, date, could, explain, the, time, traveler, s, actual, appearance, in, the, present, these, views, are, contested, by, some, authors, a, common, objection, to, the, idea, of, traveling, back, in, time, is, put, forth, in, the, grandfather, paradox, or, the, argument, of, auto, infanticide, if, one, were, able, to, go, back, in, time, inconsistencies, and, contradictions, would, ensue, if, the, time, traveler, were, to, change, anything, there, is, a, contradiction, if, the, past, becomes, different, from, the, way, it, is, the, paradox, is, commonly, described, with, a, person, who, travels, to, the, past, and, kills, their, own, grandfather, prevents, the, existence, of, their, father, or, mother, and, therefore, their, own, existence, philosophers, question, whether, these, paradoxes, prove, time, travel, impossible, some, philosophers, answer, these, paradoxes, by, arguing, that, it, might, be, the, case, that, backward, time, travel, could, be, possible, but, that, it, would, be, impossible, to, actually, change, the, past, in, any, way, an, idea, similar, to, the, proposed, novikov, self, consistency, principle, in, physics, according, to, the, philosophical, theory, of, compossibility, what, can, happen, for, example, in, the, context, of, time, travel, must, be, weighed, against, the, context, of, everything, relating, to, the, situation, if, the, past, is, a, certain, way, it, s, not, possible, for, it, to, be, any, other, way, what, can, happen, when, a, time, traveler, visits, the, past, is, limited, to, what, did, happen, in, order, to, prevent, logical, contradictions, the, novikov, self, consistency, principle, named, after, igor, dmitrievich, novikov, states, that, any, actions, taken, by, a, time, traveler, or, by, an, object, that, travels, back, in, time, were, part, of, history, all, along, and, therefore, it, is, impossible, for, the, time, traveler, to, change, history, in, any, way, the, time, traveler, s, actions, may, be, the, cause, of, events, in, their, own, past, though, which, leads, to, the, potential, for, circular, causation, sometimes, called, a, predestination, paradox, ontological, paradox, or, bootstrap, paradox, the, term, bootstrap, paradox, was, popularized, by, robert, a, heinlein, s, story, by, his, bootstraps, the, novikov, self, consistency, principle, proposes, that, the, local, laws, of, physics, in, a, region, of, spacetime, containing, time, travelers, cannot, be, any, different, from, the, local, laws, of, physics, in, any, other, region, of, spacetime, the, philosopher, kelley, l, ross, argues, in, time, travel, paradoxes, that, in, a, scenario, involving, a, physical, object, whose, world, line, or, history, forms, a, closed, loop, in, time, there, can, be, a, violation, of, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, ross, uses, the, film, somewhere, in, time, as, an, example, of, such, an, ontological, paradox, where, a, watch, is, given, to, a, person, and, 60, years, later, the, same, watch, is, brought, back, in, time, and, given, to, the, same, character, ross, states, that, entropy, of, the, watch, will, increase, and, the, watch, carried, back, in, time, will, be, more, worn, with, each, repetition, of, its, history, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, is, understood, by, modern, physicists, to, be, a, statistical, law, so, decreasing, entropy, and, non, increasing, entropy, are, not, impossible, just, improbable, additionally, entropy, statistically, increases, in, systems, which, are, isolated, so, non, isolated, systems, such, as, an, object, that, interact, with, the, outside, world, can, become, less, worn, and, decrease, in, entropy, and, it, s, possible, for, an, object, whose, world, line, forms, a, closed, loop, to, be, always, in, the, same, condition, in, the, same, point, of, its, history, 23, in, 2005, daniel, greenberger, and, karl, svozil, proposed, that, quantum, theory, gives, a, model, for, time, travel, where, the, past, must, be, self, consistent
