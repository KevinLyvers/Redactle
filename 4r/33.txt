largest, ancient, amphitheatre, ever, built, and, is, still, the, largest, standing, amphitheatre, in, the, world, despite, its, age, construction, began, under, the, emperor, vespasian, r, 69, 79, ad, in, 72, and, was, completed, in, ad, 80, under, his, successor, and, heir, titus, r, 79, 81, further, modifications, were, made, during, the, reign, of, domitian, r, 81, 96, the, three, emperors, who, were, patrons, of, the, work, are, known, as, the, flavian, dynasty, and, the, amphitheatre, was, named, the, flavian, amphitheatre, latin, amphitheatrum, flavium, italian, anfiteatro, flavio, by, later, classicists, and, archaeologists, for, its, association, with, their, family, name, flavius, the, colosseum, is, built, of, travertine, limestone, tuff, volcanic, rock, and, brick, faced, concrete, it, could, hold, an, estimated, 50, 000, to, 80, 000, spectators, at, various, points, in, its, history, having, an, average, audience, of, some, 65, 000, it, was, used, for, gladiatorial, contests, and, public, spectacles, including, animal, hunts, executions, re, enactments, of, famous, battles, dramas, based, on, roman, mythology, and, briefly, mock, sea, battles, the, building, ceased, to, be, used, for, entertainment, in, the, early, medieval, era, it, was, later, reused, for, such, purposes, as, housing, workshops, quarters, for, a, religious, order, a, fortress, a, quarry, and, a, christian, shrine, although, substantially, ruined, by, earthquakes, and, stone, robbers, taking, spolia, the, colosseum, is, still, a, renowned, symbol, of, imperial, rome, and, was, listed, as, one, of, the, new, 7, wonders, of, the, world, it, is, one, of, rome, s, most, popular, tourist, attractions, and, has, links, to, the, catholic, church, as, each, good, friday, the, pope, leads, a, torchlit, way, of, the, cross, procession, that, starts, in, the, area, around, the, colosseum, the, colosseum, is, depicted, on, the, italian, version, of, the, 5, euro, cent, coin, originally, the, building, s, latin, name, was, simply, amphitheatrum, amphitheatre, though, the, modern, name, flavian, amphitheatre, latin, amphitheatrum, flavium, is, often, used, there, is, no, evidence, it, was, used, in, classical, antiquity, this, name, refers, to, the, patronage, of, the, flavian, dynasty, during, whose, reigns, the, building, was, constructed, but, the, structure, is, better, known, as, the, colosseum, in, antiquity, romans, may, have, referred, to, the, colosseum, by, the, unofficial, name, amphitheatrum, caesareum, with, caesareum, an, adjective, pertaining, to, the, title, caesar, but, this, name, may, have, been, strictly, poetic, as, it, was, not, exclusive, to, the, colosseum, vespasian, and, titus, builders, of, the, colosseum, also, constructed, a, flavian, amphitheatre, in, puteoli, modern, pozzuoli, the, name, colosseum, is, believed, to, be, derived, from, a, colossal, statue, of, nero, on, the, model, of, the, colossus, of, rhodes, the, giant, bronze, sculpture, of, nero, as, a, solar, deity, was, moved, to, its, position, beside, the, amphitheatre, by, the, emperor, hadrian, r, 117, 138, the, word, colosseum, is, a, neuter, latin, noun, formed, from, the, adjective, colosseus, meaning, gigantic, or, colossean, by, the, year, 1000, the, latin, name, colosseum, had, been, coined, to, refer, to, the, amphitheatre, from, the, nearby, colossus, solis, the, spelling, was, sometimes, altered, in, medieval, latin, coloseum, and, coliseum, are, attested, from, the, 12th, and, 14th, centuries, respectively, in, the, 12th, century, the, structure, was, recorded, as, the, amphitheatrum, colisei, amphitheatre, of, the, colossus, in, the, high, middle, ages, the, flavian, amphitheatre, is, attested, as, the, late, 13th, century, old, french, colos, and, in, middle, french, as, colis, e, by, the, early, 16th, century, by, which, time, the, word, could, be, applied, to, any, amphitheatre, from, middle, french, colis, e, derived, the, middle, english, colisee, in, use, by, the, middle, of, the, 15th, century, and, employed, by, john, capgrave, in, his, solace, of, pilgrims, in, which, he, remarked, middle, english, collise, eke, is, a, meruelous, place, e, moost, part, of, it, stant, at, is, day, an, english, translation, by, john, bourchier, 2nd, baron, berners, of, antonio, de, guevara, s, biography, of, marcus, aurelius, r, 161, 180, in, about, 1533, referred, to, middle, english, this, emperour, beynge, with, the, senate, at, collisee, similarly, the, italian, colosseo, or, coliseo, are, attested, as, referring, first, to, the, amphitheatre, in, rome, and, then, to, any, amphitheatre, as, italian, culiseo, in, 1367, by, 1460, an, equivalent, existed, in, catalan, coliseu, by, 1495, had, appeared, the, spanish, coliseo, and, by, 1548, the, portuguese, coliseu, the, earliest, citation, for, the, name, colosseum, in, early, modern, english, is, the, 1600, translation, by, philemon, holland, of, the, urbis, romae, topographia, of, bartolomeo, marliani, which, he, used, in, the, preparation, of, his, translation, of, livy, s, augustan, era, ab, urbe, condita, libri, the, text, states, this, amphitheatre, was, commonly, called, colosseum, of, neroes, colossus, which, was, set, up, in, the, porch, of, neroes, house, similarly, john, evelyn, translating, the, middle, french, name, le, colis, e, used, by, the, architectural, theorist, roland, fr, art, de, chambray, wrote, and, tis, indeed, a, kind, of, miracle, to, see, that, the, colosseum, and, innumerable, other, structures, which, seemed, to, have, been, built, for, eternity, should, be, at, present, so, ruinous, and, dilapidated, after, nero, s, suicide, and, the, civil, wars, of, the, year, of, the, four, emperors, the, colossus, of, nero, statue, was, remodeled, by, the, condemned, emperor, s, successors, into, the, likeness, of, helios, sol, or, apollo, the, sun, god, by, adding, the, appropriate, solar, crown, it, was, then, commonly, referred, to, as, the, colossus, solis, nero, s, head, was, also, replaced, several, times, with, the, heads, of, succeeding, emperors, despite, its, pagan, links, the, statue, remained, standing, well, into, the, middle, ages, and, was, credited, with, magical, powers, the, emperor, constantine, the, great, remodeled, the, statue, s, face, as, his, own, in, the, 8th, century, an, epigram, attributed, to, the, venerable, bede, celebrated, the, symbolic, significance, of, the, statue, in, a, prophecy, that, is, variously, quoted, quamdiu, stat, colis, us, stat, et, roma, quando, cadet, colis, us, cadet, et, roma, quando, cadet, roma, cadet, et, mundus, as, long, as, the, colossus, stands, so, shall, rome, when, the, colossus, falls, rome, shall, fall, when, rome, falls, so, falls, the, world, this, is, often, mistranslated, to, refer, to, the, colosseum, rather, than, the, colossus, as, in, for, instance, byron, s, poem, childe, harold, s, pilgrimage, however, at, the, time, that, the, pseudo, bede, wrote, the, masculine, noun, coliseus, was, applied, to, the, statue, rather, than, to, the, amphitheatre, the, colossus, did, eventually, fall, possibly, being, pulled, down, to, reuse, its, bronze, the, statue, itself, was, largely, forgotten, and, only, its, base, survives, between, the, colosseum, and, the, nearby, temple, of, venus, and, roma, the, site, chosen, was, a, flat, area, on, the, floor, of, a, low, valley, between, the, caelian, esquiline, and, palatine, hills, through, which, a, canalised, stream, ran, as, well, as, an, artificial, lake, marsh, by, the, 2nd, century, bc, the, area, was, densely, inhabited, it, was, devastated, by, the, great, fire, of, rome, in, 64, ad, following, which, nero, seized, much, of, the, area, to, add, to, his, personal, domain, he, built, the, grandiose, domus, aurea, on, the, site, in, front, of, which, he, created, an, artificial, lake, surrounded, by, pavilions, gardens, and, porticoes, the, existing, aqua, claudia, aqueduct, was, extended, to, supply, water, to, the, area, and, the, gigantic, bronze, colossus, of, nero, was, set, up, nearby, at, the, entrance, to, the, domus, aurea, although, the, colossus, was, preserved, much, of, the, domus, aurea, was, torn, down, the, lake, was, filled, in, and, the, land, reused, as, the, location, for, the, new, flavian, amphitheatre, gladiatorial, schools, and, other, support, buildings, were, constructed, nearby, within, the, former, grounds, of, the, domus, aurea, vespasian, s, decision, to, build, the, colosseum, on, the, site, of, nero, s, lake, can, be, seen, as, a, populist, gesture, of, returning, to, the, people, an, area, of, the, city, which, nero, had, appropriated, for, his, own, use, in, contrast, to, many, other, amphitheatres, which, were, on, the, outskirts, of, a, city, the, colosseum, was, constructed, in, the, city, centre, in, effect, placing, it, both, symbolically, and, geographically, at, the, heart, of, rome, construction, was, funded, by, the, opulent, spoils, taken, from, the, jewish, temple, after, the, first, jewish, roman, war, in, 70, ad, led, to, the, siege, of, jerusalem, according, to, a, reconstructed, inscription, found, on, the, site, the, emperor, vespasian, ordered, this, new, amphitheatre, to, be, erected, from, his, general, s, share, of, the, booty, it, is, often, assumed, that, jewish, prisoners, of, war, were, brought, back, to, rome, and, contributed, to, the, massive, workforce, needed, for, the, construction, of, the, amphitheatre, this, claim, is, disputed, it, would, nonetheless, be, commensurate, with, roman, practice, to, add, humiliation, to, the, defeated, population, along, with, this, free, source, of, unskilled, labor, teams, of, professional, roman, builders, engineers, artists, painters, and, decorators, undertook, the, more, specialized, tasks, necessary, for, building, the, colosseum, the, colosseum, was, constructed, with, several, different, materials, wood, limestone, tuff, tiles, cement, and, mortar, construction, of, the, colosseum, began, under, the, rule, of, vespasian, in, around, 70, 72, ad, 73, 75, ad, according, to, some, sources, the, colosseum, had, been, completed, up, to, the, third, story, by, the, time, of, vespasian, s, death, in, 79, the, top, level, was, finished, by, his, son, titus, in, 80, and, the, inaugural, games, were, held, in, 80, or, 81, ad, dio, cassius, recounts, that, over, 9, 000, wild, animals, were, killed, during, the, inaugural, games, of, the, amphitheatre, commemorative, coinage, was, issued, celebrating, the, inauguration, the, building, was, remodelled, further, under, vespasian, s, younger, son, the, newly, designated, emperor, domitian, who, constructed, the, hypogeum, a, series, of, tunnels, used, to, house, animals, and, slaves, he, also, added, a, gallery, to, the, top, of, the, colosseum, to, increase, its, seating, capacity, in, 217, the, colosseum, was, badly, damaged, by, a, major, fire, caused, by, lightning, according, to, dio, cassius, which, destroyed, the, wooden, upper, levels, of, the, amphitheatre, s, interior, it, was, not, fully, repaired, until, about, 240, and, underwent, further, repairs, in, 250, or, 252, and, again, in, 320, honorius, banned, the, practice, of, gladiator, fights, in, 399, and, again, in, 404, gladiatorial, fights, are, last, mentioned, around, 435, an, inscription, records, the, restoration, of, various, parts, of, the, colosseum, under, theodosius, ii, and, valentinian, iii, reigned, 425, 455, possibly, to, repair, damage, caused, by, a, major, earthquake, in, 443, more, work, followed, in, 484, and, 508, the, arena, continued, to, be, used, for, contests, well, into, the, 6th, century, animal, hunts, continued, until, at, least, 523, when, anicius, maximus, celebrated, his, consulship, with, some, venationes, criticised, by, king, theodoric, the, great, for, their, high, cost, the, colosseum, underwent, several, radical, changes, of, use, by, the, late, 6th, century, a, small, chapel, had, been, built, into, the, structure, of, the, amphitheater, though, this, apparently, did, not, confer, any, particular, religious, significance, on, the, building, as, a, whole, the, arena, was, converted, into, a, cemetery, the, numerous, vaulted, spaces, in, the, arcades, under, the, seating, were, converted, into, housing, and, workshops, and, are, recorded, as, still, being, rented, out, as, late, as, the, 12th, century, around, 1200, the, frangipani, family, took, over, the, colosseum, and, fortified, it, apparently, using, it, as, a, castle, in, the, early, to, mid, 14th, century, the, pope, s, relocation, to, avignon, caused, a, population, decline, in, rome, that, left, the, region, insecure, the, colosseum, was, largely, abandoned, by, the, public, and, became, a, popular, den, for, bandits, severe, damage, was, inflicted, on, the, colosseum, by, the, great, earthquake, in, 1349, causing, the, outer, south, side, lying, on, a, less, stable, alluvial, terrain, to, collapse, much, of, the, tumbled, stone, was, reused, to, build, palaces, churches, hospitals, and, other, buildings, elsewhere, in, rome, in, 1377, after, the, pope, s, return, to, rome, the, colosseum, was, restored, by, a, religious, order, called, arciconfraternita, del, ss, salvatore, ad, sancta, sanctorum, who, then, inhabited, a, northern, portion, of, it, until, as, late, as, the, early, 19th, century, the, interior, of, the, amphitheater, was, extensively, stripped, of, stone, which, was, reused, elsewhere, or, in, the, case, of, the, marble, fa, ade, was, burned, to, make, quicklime, the, iron, clamps, which, held, the, stonework, together, were, pried, or, hacked, out, of, the, walls, leaving, numerous, pockmarks, which, still, scar, the, building, today, during, the, 16th, and, 17th, century, church, officials, sought, a, productive, role, for, the, colosseum, pope, sixtus, v, 1585, 1590, planned, to, turn, the, building, into, a, wool, factory, to, provide, employment, for, rome, s, prostitutes, though, this, proposal, fell, through, with, his, premature, death, in, 1671, cardinal, altieri, authorized, its, use, for, bullfights, a, public, outcry, caused, the, idea, to, be, hastily, abandoned, in, 1749, pope, benedict, xiv, endorsed, the, view, that, the, colosseum, was, a, sacred, site, where, early, christians, had, been, martyred, he, forbade, the, use, of, the, colosseum, as, a, quarry, and, consecrated, the, building, to, the, passion, of, christ, and, installed, stations, of, the, cross, declaring, it, sanctified, by, the, blood, of, the, christian, martyrs, who, perished, there, see, significance, in, christianity, however, there, is, no, historical, evidence, to, support, benedict, s, claim, nor, is, there, even, any, evidence, that, anyone, before, the, 16th, century, suggested, this, might, be, the, case, the, catholic, encyclopedia, concludes, that, there, are, no, historical, grounds, for, the, supposition, other, than, the, reasonably, plausible, conjecture, that, some, of, the, many, martyrs, may, well, have, been, later, popes, initiated, various, stabilization, and, restoration, projects, removing, the, extensive, vegetation, which, had, overgrown, the, structure, and, threatened, to, damage, it, further, the, fa, ade, was, reinforced, with, triangular, brick, wedges, in, 1807, and, 1827, and, the, interior, was, repaired, in, 1831, 1846, and, in, the, 1930s, the, arena, substructure, was, partly, excavated, in, 1810, 1814, and, 1874, and, was, fully, exposed, under, benito, mussolini, in, the, 1930s, the, colosseum, is, today, one, of, rome, s, most, popular, tourist, attractions, receiving, millions, of, visitors, annually, the, effects, of, pollution, and, general, deterioration, over, time, prompted, a, major, restoration, programme, carried, out, between, 1993, and, 2000, at, a, cost, of, lire, 40, billion, 19, 3m, 20, 6m, at, 2000, prices, in, recent, years, the, colosseum, has, become, a, symbol, of, the, international, campaign, against, capital, punishment, which, was, abolished, in, italy, in, 1948, several, anti, death, penalty, demonstrations, took, place, in, front, of, the, colosseum, in, 2000, since, that, time, as, a, gesture, against, the, death, penalty, the, local, authorities, of, rome, change, the, color, of, the, colosseum, s, night, time, illumination, from, white, to, gold, whenever, a, person, condemned, to, the, death, penalty, anywhere, in, the, world, gets, their, sentence, commuted, or, is, released, or, if, a, jurisdiction, abolishes, the, death, penalty, most, recently, the, colosseum, was, illuminated, in, gold, in, november, 2012, following, the, abolishment, of, capital, punishment, in, the, american, state, of, connecticut, in, april, 2012, because, of, the, ruined, state, of, the, interior, it, is, impractical, to, use, the, colosseum, to, host, large, events, only, a, few, hundred, spectators, can, be, accommodated, in, temporary, seating, however, much, larger, concerts, have, been, held, just, outside, using, the, colosseum, as, a, backdrop, performers, who, have, played, at, the, colosseum, in, recent, years, have, included, ray, charles, may, 2002, paul, mccartney, may, 2003, elton, john, september, 2005, and, billy, joel, july, 2006, unlike, roman, theatres, that, were, built, into, hillsides, the, colosseum, is, an, entirely, free, standing, structure, it, derives, its, basic, exterior, and, interior, architecture, from, that, of, two, theatres, back, to, back, it, is, elliptical, in, plan, and, is, 189, meters, 615, ft, 640, roman, feet, long, and, 156, meters, 510, ft, 528, roman, feet, wide, with, a, base, area, of, 24, 000, square, metres, 6, acres, the, height, of, the, outer, wall, is, 48, meters, 157, ft, 165, roman, feet, the, perimeter, originally, measured, 545, meters, 1, 788, ft, 1, 835, roman, feet, the, central, arena, is, an, ellipse, 87, m, 287, ft, long, and, 55, m, 180, ft, wide, surrounded, by, a, wall, 5, m, 15, ft, high, above, which, rose, tiers, of, seating, the, outer, wall, is, estimated, to, have, required, over, 100, 000, cubic, metres, 3, 5, million, cubic, feet, of, travertine, stone, which, were, set, without, mortar, they, were, held, together, by, 300, tons, of, iron, clamps, however, it, has, suffered, extensive, damage, over, the, centuries, with, large, segments, having, collapsed, following, earthquakes, the, north, side, of, the, perimeter, wall, is, still, standing, the, distinctive, triangular, brick, wedges, at, each, end, are, modern, additions, having, been, constructed, in, the, early, 19th, century, to, shore, up, the, wall, the, remainder, of, the, present, day, exterior, of, the, colosseum, is, in, fact, the, original, interior, wall, the, surviving, part, of, the, outer, wall, s, monumental, fa, ade, comprises, three, superposed, storeys, surmounted, by, a, podium, on, which, stands, a, tall, attic, both, of, which, are, pierced, by, windows, interspersed, at, regular, intervals, the, arcades, are, framed, by, half, columns, of, the, doric, ionic, and, corinthian, orders, while, the, attic, is, decorated, with, corinthian, pilasters, each, of, the, arches, in, the, second, and, third, floor, arcades, framed, statues, probably, honoring, divinities, and, other, figures, from, classical, mythology, two, hundred, and, forty, mast, corbels, were, positioned, around, the, top, of, the, attic, they, originally, supported, a, retractable, awning, known, as, the, velarium, that, kept, the, sun, and, rain, off, spectators, this, consisted, of, a, canvas, covered, net, like, structure, made, of, ropes, with, a, hole, in, the, center, it, covered, two, thirds, of, the, arena, and, sloped, down, towards, the, center, to, catch, the, wind, and, provide, a, breeze, for, the, audience, sailors, specially, enlisted, from, the, roman, naval, headquarters, at, misenum, and, housed, in, the, nearby, castra, misenatium, were, used, to, work, the, velarium, the, colosseum, s, huge, crowd, capacity, made, it, essential, that, the, venue, could, be, filled, or, evacuated, quickly, its, architects, adopted, solutions, very, similar, to, those, used, in, modern, stadia, to, deal, with, the, same, problem, the, amphitheatre, was, ringed, by, eighty, entrances, at, ground, level, 76, of, which, were, used, by, ordinary, spectators, each, entrance, and, exit, was, numbered, as, was, each, staircase, the, northern, main, entrance, was, reserved, for, the, roman, emperor, and, his, aides, whilst, the, other, three, axial, entrances, were, most, likely, used, by, the, elite, all, four, axial, entrances, were, richly, decorated, with, painted, stucco, reliefs, of, which, fragments, survive, many, of, the, original, outer, entrances, have, disappeared, with, the, collapse, of, the, perimeter, wall, but, entrances, xxiii, 23, to, liiii, 54, survive, spectators, were, given, tickets, in, the, form, of, numbered, pottery, shards, which, directed, them, to, the, appropriate, section, and, row, they, accessed, their, seats, via, vomitoria, singular, vomitorium, passageways, that, opened, into, a, tier, of, seats, from, below, or, behind, these, quickly, dispersed, people, into, their, seats, and, upon, conclusion, of, the, event, or, in, an, emergency, evacuation, could, permit, their, exit, within, only, a, few, minutes, the, name, vomitoria, derived, from, the, latin, word, for, a, rapid, discharge, from, which, english, derives, the, word, vomit, according, to, the, codex, calendar, of, 354, the, colosseum, could, accommodate, 87, 000, people, although, modern, estimates, put, the, figure, at, around, 50, 000, they, were, seated, in, a, tiered, arrangement, that, reflected, the, rigidly, stratified, nature, of, roman, society, special, boxes, were, provided, at, the, north, and, south, ends, respectively, for, the, emperor, and, the, vestal, virgins, providing, the, best, views, of, the, arena, flanking, them, at, the, same, level, was, a, broad, platform, or, podium, for, the, senatorial, class, who, were, allowed, to, bring, their, own, chairs, the, names, of, some, 5th, century, senators, can, still, be, seen, carved, into, the, stonework, presumably, reserving, areas, for, their, use, the, tier, above, the, senators, known, as, the, maenianum, primum, was, occupied, by, the, non, senatorial, noble, class, or, knights, equites, the, next, level, up, the, maenianum, secundum, was, originally, reserved, for, ordinary, roman, citizens, plebeians, and, was, divided, into, two, sections, the, lower, part, the, immum, was, for, wealthy, citizens, while, the, upper, part, the, summum, was, for, poor, citizens, specific, sectors, were, provided, for, other, social, groups, for, instance, boys, with, their, tutors, soldiers, on, leave, foreign, dignitaries, scribes, heralds, priests, and, so, on, stone, and, later, marble, seating, was, provided, for, the, citizens, and, nobles, who, presumably, would, have, brought, their, own, cushions, with, them, inscriptions, identified, the, areas, reserved, for, specific, groups, another, level, the, maenianum, secundum, in, legneis, was, added, at, the, very, top, of, the, building, during, the, reign, of, domitian, this, comprised, a, gallery, for, the, common, poor, slaves, and, women, it, would, have, been, either, standing, room, only, or, would, have, had, very, steep, wooden, benches, some, groups, were, banned, altogether, from, the, colosseum, notably, gravediggers, actors, and, former, gladiators, each, tier, was, divided, into, sections, maeniana, by, curved, passages, and, low, walls, praecinctiones, or, baltei, and, were, subdivided, into, cunei, or, wedges, by, the, steps, and, aisles, from, the, vomitoria, each, row, gradus, of, seats, was, numbered, permitting, each, individual, seat, to, be, exactly, designated, by, its, gradus, cuneus, and, number, the, arena, itself, was, 83, meters, by, 48, meters, 272, ft, by, 157, ft, 280, by, 163, roman, feet, it, comprised, a, wooden, floor, covered, by, sand, the, latin, word, for, sand, is, harena, or, arena, covering, an, elaborate, underground, structure, called, the, hypogeum, literally, meaning, underground, the, hypogeum, was, not, part, of, the, original, construction, but, was, ordered, to, be, built, by, emperor, domitian, little, now, remains, of, the, original, arena, floor, but, the, hypogeum, is, still, clearly, visible, it, consisted, of, a, two, level, subterranean, network, of, tunnels, and, cages, beneath, the, arena, where, gladiators, and, animals, were, held, before, contests, began, eighty, vertical, shafts, provided, instant, access, to, the, arena, for, caged, animals, and, scenery, pieces, concealed, underneath, larger, hinged, platforms, called, hegmata, provided, access, for, elephants, and, the, like, it, was, restructured, on, numerous, occasions, at, least, twelve, different, phases, of, construction, can, be, seen, the, hypogeum, was, connected, by, tunnels, to, a, number, of, points, outside, the, colosseum, animals, and, performers, were, brought, through, the, tunnel, from, nearby, stables, with, the, gladiators, barracks, at, the, ludus, magnus, to, the, east, also, being, connected, by, tunnels, separate, tunnels, were, provided, for, the, emperor, and, the, vestal, virgins, to, permit, them, to, enter, and, exit, the, colosseum, without, needing, to, pass, through, the, crowds, substantial, quantities, of, machinery, also, existed, in, the, hypogeum, elevators, and, pulleys, raised, and, lowered, scenery, and, props, as, well, as, lifting, caged, animals, to, the, surface, for, release, there, is, evidence, for, the, existence, of, major, hydraulic, mechanisms, and, according, to, ancient, accounts, it, was, possible, to, flood, the, arena, rapidly, presumably, via, a, connection, to, a, nearby, aqueduct, however, the, construction, of, the, hypogeum, at, domitian, s, behest, put, an, end, to, the, practise, of, flooding, and, thus, also, to, naval, battles, early, in, the, colosseum, s, existence, there, is, however, wide, debate, over, the, practicality, and, logistics, of, this, phenomenon, which, leads, to, speculation, over, its, actuality, this, is, mostly, because, there, is, no, physical, evidence, of, naumachiae, at, the, colosseum, remains, the, colosseum, and, its, activities, supported, a, substantial, industry, in, the, area, in, addition, to, the, amphitheatre, itself, many, other, buildings, nearby, were, linked, to, the, games, immediately, to, the, east, is, the, remains, of, the, ludus, magnus, a, training, school, for, gladiators, this, was, connected, to, the, colosseum, by, an, underground, passage, to, allow, easy, access, for, the, gladiators, the, ludus, magnus, had, its, own, miniature, training, arena, which, was, itself, a, popular, attraction, for, roman, spectators, other, training, schools, were, in, the, same, area, including, the, ludus, matutinus, morning, school, where, fighters, of, animals, were, trained, plus, the, dacian, and, gallic, schools, also, nearby, were, the, armamentarium, comprising, an, armory, to, store, weapons, the, summum, choragium, where, machinery, was, stored, the, sanitarium, which, had, facilities, to, treat, wounded, gladiators, and, the, spoliarium, where, bodies, of, dead, gladiators, were, stripped, of, their, armor, and, disposed, of, around, the, perimeter, of, the, colosseum, at, a, distance, of, 18, m, 59, ft, from, the, perimeter, was, a, series, of, tall, stone, posts, with, five, remaining, on, the, eastern, side, various, explanations, have, been, advanced, for, their, presence, they, may, have, been, a, religious, boundary, or, an, outer, boundary, for, ticket, checks, or, an, anchor, for, the, velarium, or, awning, the, colosseum, was, used, to, host, gladiatorial, shows, as, well, as, a, variety, of, other, events, the, shows, called, munera, were, always, given, by, private, individuals, rather, than, the, state, they, had, a, strong, religious, element, but, were, also, demonstrations, of, power, and, family, prestige, and, were, immensely, popular, another, major, attraction, was, the, animal, hunt, or, venatio, this, utilized, a, great, variety, of, wild, beasts, mainly, imported, from, africa, and, the, middle, east, and, included, creatures, such, as, rhinoceros, hippopotamuses, elephants, giraffes, aurochs, wisents, barbary, lions, panthers, leopards, bears, caspian, tigers, crocodiles, and, ostriches, battles, and, hunts, were, often, staged, amid, elaborate, sets, with, movable, trees, and, buildings, these, events, could, be, huge, in, scale, trajan, is, said, to, have, celebrated, his, victories, in, dacia, in, 107, with, contests, involving, 11, 000, animals, and, 10, 000, gladiators, over, the, course, of, 123, days, during, lunch, intervals, executions, ad, bestias, would, be, staged, those, condemned, to, death, would, be, sent, into, the, arena, naked, and, unarmed, to, face, the, beasts, of, death, which, would, literally, tear, them, to, pieces, acrobats, and, magicians, would, also, perform, usually, during, the, intervals, during, the, early, days, of, the, colosseum, ancient, writers, recorded, that, the, building, was, used, for, naumachiae, more, properly, known, as, navalia, proelia, or, simulated, sea, battles, accounts, of, the, inaugural, games, held, by, titus, in, ad, 80, describe, it, being, filled, with, water, for, a, display, of, specially, trained, swimming, horses, and, bulls, there, is, also, an, account, of, a, re, enactment, of, a, famous, sea, battle, between, the, corcyrean, corfiot, greeks, and, the, corinthians, this, has, been, the, subject, of, some, debate, among, historians, although, providing, the, water, would, not, have, been, a, problem, it, is, unclear, how, the, arena, could, have, been, waterproofed, nor, would, there, have, been, enough, space, in, the, arena, for, the, warships, to, move, around, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, reports, either, have, the, location, wrong, or, that, the, colosseum, originally, featured, a, wide, floodable, channel, down, its, central, axis, which, would, later, have, been, replaced, by, the, hypogeum, sylvae, or, recreations, of, natural, scenes, were, also, held, in, the, arena, painters, technicians, and, architects, would, construct, a, simulation, of, a, forest, with, real, trees, and, bushes, planted, in, the, arena, s, floor, and, animals, would, then, be, introduced, such, scenes, might, be, used, simply, to, display, a, natural, environment, for, the, urban, population, or, could, otherwise, be, used, as, the, backdrop, for, hunts, or, dramas, depicting, episodes, from, mythology, they, were, also, occasionally, used, for, executions, in, which, the, hero, of, the, story, played, by, a, condemned, person, was, killed, in, one, of, various, gruesome, but, mythologically, authentic, ways, such, as, being, mauled, by, beasts, or, burned, to, death, beneath, the, colosseum, a, network, of, subterranean, passageways, that, were, once, used, for, transporting, wild, animals, and, gladiators, to, the, arena, opened, to, the, public, in, summer, 2010, the, colosseum, is, also, the, site, of, roman, catholic, ceremonies, in, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, for, instance, pope, benedict, xvi, led, the, stations, of, the, cross, called, the, scriptural, way, of, the, cross, which, calls, for, more, meditation, at, the, colosseum, on, good, fridays, in, 2011, diego, della, valle, head, of, the, shoe, firm, tod, s, entered, into, an, agreement, with, local, officials, to, sponsor, a, 25, million, restoration, of, the, colosseum, work, was, planned, to, begin, at, the, end, of, 2011, taking, up, to, two, and, a, half, years, due, to, the, controversial, nature, of, using, a, public, private, partnership, to, fund, the, restoration, work, was, delayed, and, began, in, 2013, the, restoration, is, the, first, full, cleaning, and, repair, in, the, colosseum, s, history, the, first, stage, is, to, clean, and, restore, the, colosseum, s, arcaded, fa, ade, and, replace, the, metal, enclosures, that, block, the, ground, level, arches, after, three, years, the, work, was, completed, on, 1, july, 2016, when, the, italian, minister, of, culture, dario, franceschini, also, announced, that, the, funds, have, been, committed, to, replace, the, floors, by, the, end, of, 2018, these, will, provide, a, stage, that, franceschini, says, will, be, used, for, cultural, events, of, the, highest, level, the, project, also, includes, creating, a, services, center, and, restoring, the, galleries, and, underground, spaces, inside, the, colosseum, since, 1, november, 2017, the, top, two, levels, have, been, opened, for, guided, visits, the, fourth, level, held, the, marketplace, and, the, top, fifth, tier, is, where, the, poorest, citizens, the, plebeians, gathered, and, watched, the, show, bringing, picnics, for, the, day, long, event, the, colosseum, is, generally, regarded, by, christians, as, a, site, of, the, martyrdom, of, large, numbers, of, believers, during, the, persecution, of, christians, in, the, roman, empire, as, evidenced, by, church, history, and, tradition, on, the, other, hand, other, scholars, believe, that, the, majority, of, martyrdoms, may, have, occurred, at, other, venues, within, the, city, of, rome, rather, than, at, the, colosseum, citing, a, lack, of, still, intact, physical, evidence, or, historical, records, these, scholars, assert, that, some, christians, were, executed, as, common, criminals, in, the, colosseum, their, crime, being, refusal, to, reverence, the, roman, gods, but, most, christian, martyrs, of, the, early, church, were, executed, for, their, faith, at, the, circus, maximus, according, to, irenaeus, died, about, 202, ignatius, of, antioch, was, fed, to, the, lions, in, rome, around, 107, a, d, and, although, irenaeus, says, nothing, about, this, happening, at, the, colosseum, tradition, ascribes, it, to, that, place, in, the, middle, ages, the, colosseum, was, not, regarded, as, a, monument, and, was, used, as, what, some, modern, sources, label, a, quarry, which, is, to, say, that, stones, from, the, colosseum, were, taken, for, the, building, of, other, sacred, sites, this, fact, is, used, to, support, the, idea, that, at, a, time, when, sites, associated, with, martyrs, were, highly, venerated, the, colosseum, was, not, being, treated, as, a, sacred, site, it, was, not, included, in, the, itineraries, compiled, for, the, use, of, pilgrims, nor, in, works, such, as, the, 12th, century, mirabilia, urbis, romae, marvels, of, the, city, of, rome, which, claims, the, circus, flaminius, but, not, the, colosseum, as, the, site, of, martyrdoms, part, of, the, structure, was, inhabited, by, a, christian, religious, order, but, it, is, not, known, whether, this, was, for, any, particular, religious, reason, pope, pius, v, 1566, 1572, is, said, to, have, recommended, that, pilgrims, gather, sand, from, the, arena, of, the, colosseum, to, serve, as, a, relic, on, the, grounds, that, it, was, impregnated, with, the, blood, of, martyrs, although, some, of, his, contemporaries, did, not, share, his, conviction, a, century, later, fioravante, martinelli, listed, the, colosseum, at, the, head, of, a, list, of, places, sacred, to, the, martyrs, in, his, 1653, book, roma, ex, ethnica, sacra, martinelli, s, book, evidently, had, an, effect, on, public, opinion, in, response, to, cardinal, altieri, s, proposal, some, years, later, to, turn, the, colosseum, into, a, bullring, carlo, tomassi, published, a, pamphlet, in, protest, against, what, he, regarded, as, an, act, of, desecration, the, ensuing, controversy, persuaded, pope, clement, x, to, close, the, colosseum, s, external, arcades, and, declare, it, a, sanctuary, at, the, insistence, of, st, leonard, of, port, maurice, pope, benedict, xiv, 1740, 1758, forbade, the, quarrying, of, the, colosseum, and, erected, stations, of, the, cross, around, the, arena, which, remained, until, february, 1874, benedict, joseph, labre, spent, the, later, years, of, his, life, within, the, walls, of, the, colosseum, living, on, alms, before, he, died, in, 1783, several, 19th, century, popes, funded, repair, and, restoration, work, on, the, colosseum, and, it, still, retains, its, christian, connection, today, a, christian, cross, stands, in, the, colosseum, with, a, plaque, stating, the, amphitheater, one, consecrated, to, triumphs, entertainments, and, the, impious, worship, of, pagan, gods, is, now, dedicated, to, the, sufferings, of, the, martyrs, purified, from, impious, superstitions, other, christian, crosses, stand, in, several, points, around, the, arena, and, every, good, friday, the, pope, leads, a, via, crucis, procession, to, the, amphitheater, the, colosseum, has, a, wide, and, well, documented, history, of, flora, ever, since, domenico, panaroli, made, the, first, catalogue, of, its, plants, in, 1643, since, then, 684, species, have, been, identified, there, the, peak, was, in, 1855, 420, species, attempts, were, made, in, 1871, to, eradicate, the, vegetation, because, of, concerns, over, the, damage, that, was, being, caused, to, the, masonry, but, much, of, it, has, returned, two, hundred, forty, two, species, have, been, counted, today, and, of, the, species, first, identified, by, panaroli, 200, remain, the, variation, of, plants, can, be, explained, by, the, change, of, climate, in, rome, through, the, centuries, additionally, bird, migration, flower, blooming, and, the, growth, of, rome, that, caused, the, colosseum, to, become, embedded, within, the, modern, city, centre, rather, than, on, the, outskirts, of, the, ancient, city, as, well, as, deliberate, transport, of, species, are, also, contributing, causes, another, reason, often, given, is, their, seeds, being, unwittingly, transported, either, on, the, fur, or, in, the, feces, of, animals, brought, there, from, all, corners, of, the, empire, the, colosseum, has, appeared, in, numerous, films, artworks, and, games, it, is, featured, in, films, such, as, roman, holiday, gladiator, the, way, of, the, dragon, jumper, and, godzilla, x, kong, the, new, empire, several, architectural, works, have, also, been, modelled, on, or, inspired, by, the, colosseum, these, include
