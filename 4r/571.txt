the, starry, night, is, an, oil, on, canvas, painting, by, the, dutch, post, impressionist, painter, vincent, van, gogh, painted, in, june, 1889, it, depicts, the, view, from, the, east, facing, window, of, his, asylum, room, at, saint, r, my, de, provence, just, before, sunrise, with, the, addition, of, an, imaginary, village, it, has, been, in, the, permanent, collection, of, the, museum, of, modern, art, in, new, york, city, since, 1941, acquired, through, the, lillie, p, bliss, bequest, widely, regarded, as, van, gogh, s, magnum, opus, the, starry, night, is, one, of, the, most, recognizable, paintings, in, western, art, in, the, aftermath, of, the, 23, december, 1888, breakdown, that, resulted, in, the, self, mutilation, of, his, left, ear, van, gogh, voluntarily, admitted, himself, to, the, saint, paul, de, mausole, lunatic, asylum, on, 8, may, 1889, housed, in, a, former, monastery, saint, paul, de, mausole, catered, to, the, wealthy, and, was, less, than, half, full, when, van, gogh, arrived, allowing, him, to, occupy, not, only, a, second, story, bedroom, but, also, a, ground, floor, room, for, use, as, a, painting, studio, during, the, year, van, gogh, stayed, at, the, asylum, in, saint, r, my, de, provence, the, prolific, output, of, paintings, he, had, begun, in, arles, continued, during, this, period, he, produced, some, of, the, best, known, works, of, his, career, including, the, irises, from, may, 1889, now, in, the, j, paul, getty, museum, and, the, blue, self, portrait, from, september, 1889, in, the, mus, e, d, orsay, the, starry, night, was, painted, mid, june, by, around, 18, june, the, date, he, wrote, to, his, brother, theo, to, say, he, had, a, new, study, of, a, starry, sky, although, the, starry, night, was, painted, during, the, day, in, van, gogh, s, ground, floor, studio, it, would, be, inaccurate, to, state, that, the, picture, was, painted, from, memory, the, view, has, been, identified, as, the, one, from, his, bedroom, window, facing, east, a, view, which, van, gogh, painted, variations, of, no, fewer, than, twenty, one, times, including, the, starry, night, through, the, iron, barred, window, he, wrote, to, his, brother, theo, around, 23, may, 1889, i, can, see, an, enclosed, square, of, wheat, above, which, in, the, morning, i, watch, the, sun, rise, in, all, its, glory, van, gogh, depicted, the, view, at, different, times, of, the, day, and, under, various, weather, conditions, such, as, the, sunrise, moonrise, sunshine, filled, days, overcast, days, windy, days, and, one, day, with, rain, while, the, hospital, staff, did, not, allow, van, gogh, to, paint, in, his, bedroom, he, was, able, there, to, make, sketches, in, ink, or, charcoal, on, paper, eventually, he, would, base, newer, variations, on, previous, versions, the, pictorial, element, uniting, all, of, these, paintings, is, the, diagonal, line, coming, in, from, the, right, depicting, the, low, rolling, hills, of, the, alpilles, mountains, in, fifteen, of, the, twenty, one, versions, cypress, trees, are, visible, beyond, the, far, wall, enclosing, the, wheat, field, van, gogh, exaggerated, their, size, in, six, of, these, paintings, most, notably, in, f717, wheat, field, with, cypresses, and, the, starry, night, bringing, the, trees, closer, to, the, picture, plane, one, of, the, first, paintings, of, the, view, was, f611, mountainous, landscape, behind, saint, r, my, now, in, copenhagen, van, gogh, made, several, sketches, for, the, painting, of, which, f1547, the, enclosed, wheatfield, after, a, storm, is, typical, it, is, unclear, whether, the, painting, was, made, in, his, studio, or, outside, in, his, 9, june, letter, describing, it, he, mentions, he, had, been, working, outside, for, a, few, days, van, gogh, described, the, second, of, the, two, landscapes, he, mentions, he, was, working, on, in, a, letter, to, his, sister, wil, on, 16, june, 1889, this, is, f719, green, wheat, field, with, cypress, now, in, prague, and, the, first, painting, at, the, asylum, he, painted, en, plein, air, f1548, wheatfield, saint, r, my, de, provence, now, in, new, york, is, a, study, for, it, two, days, later, vincent, wrote, to, theo, stating, that, he, had, painted, a, starry, sky, the, starry, night, is, the, only, nocturne, in, the, series, of, views, from, his, bedroom, window, in, early, june, vincent, wrote, to, theo, this, morning, i, saw, the, countryside, from, my, window, a, long, time, before, sunrise, with, nothing, but, the, morning, star, which, looked, very, big, researchers, have, determined, that, venus, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, morning, star, was, indeed, visible, at, dawn, in, provence, in, the, spring, of, 1889, and, was, at, that, time, nearly, as, bright, as, possible, so, the, brightest, star, in, the, painting, just, to, the, viewer, s, right, of, the, cypress, tree, is, venus, the, moon, is, stylized, as, astronomical, records, indicate, that, it, was, waning, gibbous, at, the, time, van, gogh, painted, the, picture, and, even, if, the, phase, of, the, moon, had, been, its, waning, crescent, at, the, time, van, gogh, s, moon, would, not, have, been, astronomically, correct, for, other, interpretations, of, the, moon, see, below, the, one, pictorial, element, that, was, not, visible, from, van, gogh, s, cell, is, the, village, which, is, based, on, a, sketch, f1541v, made, from, a, hillside, above, the, village, of, saint, r, my, pickvance, thought, f1541v, was, done, later, and, the, steeple, more, dutch, than, proven, al, a, conflation, of, several, van, gogh, had, painted, and, drawn, in, his, nuenen, period, and, thus, the, first, of, his, reminisces, of, the, north, he, was, to, paint, and, draw, early, the, following, year, hulsker, thought, a, landscape, on, the, reverse, f1541r, was, also, a, study, for, the, painting, despite, the, large, number, of, letters, van, gogh, wrote, he, said, very, little, about, the, starry, night, after, reporting, that, he, had, painted, a, starry, sky, in, june, van, gogh, next, mentioned, the, painting, in, a, letter, to, theo, on, or, about, 20, september, 1889, when, he, included, it, in, a, list, of, paintings, he, was, sending, to, his, brother, in, paris, referring, to, it, as, a, night, study, of, this, list, of, paintings, he, wrote, all, in, all, the, only, things, i, consider, a, little, good, in, it, are, the, wheatfield, the, mountain, the, orchard, the, olive, trees, with, the, blue, hills, and, the, portrait, and, the, entrance, to, the, quarry, and, the, rest, says, nothing, to, me, the, rest, would, include, the, starry, night, when, he, decided, to, hold, back, three, paintings, from, this, batch, to, save, money, on, postage, the, starry, night, was, one, of, the, paintings, he, did, not, send, finally, in, a, letter, to, painter, mile, bernard, from, late, november, 1889, van, gogh, referred, to, the, painting, as, a, failure, van, gogh, argued, with, bernard, and, especially, paul, gauguin, as, to, whether, one, should, paint, from, nature, as, van, gogh, preferred, or, paint, what, gauguin, called, abstractions, paintings, conceived, in, the, imagination, or, de, t, te, in, the, letter, to, bernard, van, gogh, recounted, his, experiences, when, gauguin, lived, with, him, from, october, 23, 1888, to, december, 25, of, the, same, year, when, gauguin, was, in, arles, i, once, or, twice, allowed, myself, to, be, led, astray, into, abstraction, as, you, know, but, that, was, a, delusion, dear, friend, and, one, soon, comes, up, against, a, brick, wall, and, yet, once, again, i, allowed, myself, to, be, led, astray, into, reaching, for, stars, that, are, too, big, another, failure, and, i, have, had, my, fill, of, that, van, gogh, here, is, referring, to, the, expressionistic, swirls, which, dominate, the, upper, center, portion, of, the, starry, night, theo, referred, to, these, pictorial, elements, in, a, letter, to, vincent, dated, 22, october, 1889, i, sense, what, preoccupies, you, in, the, new, canvases, like, the, village, in, the, moonlight, or, the, mountains, but, i, feel, that, the, search, for, style, takes, away, the, real, sentiment, of, things, vincent, responded, in, early, november, despite, what, you, say, in, your, previous, letter, that, the, search, for, style, often, harms, other, qualities, the, fact, is, that, i, feel, greatly, driven, to, seek, style, if, you, like, but, i, mean, by, that, a, more, manly, and, more, deliberate, drawing, if, that, will, make, me, more, like, bernard, or, gauguin, i, can, t, do, anything, about, it, but, am, inclined, to, believe, that, in, the, long, run, you, d, get, used, to, it, and, later, in, the, same, letter, he, wrote, i, know, very, well, that, the, studies, drawn, with, long, sinuous, lines, from, the, last, consignment, weren, t, what, they, ought, to, become, however, i, dare, urge, you, to, believe, that, in, landscapes, one, will, continue, to, mass, things, by, means, of, a, drawing, style, that, seeks, to, express, the, entanglement, of, the, masses, but, although, van, gogh, periodically, defended, the, practices, of, gauguin, and, bernard, each, time, he, inevitably, repudiated, them, and, continued, with, his, preferred, method, of, painting, from, nature, like, the, impressionists, he, had, met, in, paris, especially, claude, monet, van, gogh, also, favored, working, in, series, he, had, painted, his, series, of, sunflowers, in, arles, and, he, painted, the, series, of, cypresses, and, wheat, fields, at, saint, r, my, the, starry, night, belongs, to, this, latter, series, as, well, as, to, a, small, series, of, nocturnes, he, initiated, in, arles, the, nocturne, series, was, limited, by, the, difficulties, posed, by, painting, such, scenes, from, nature, i, e, at, night, the, first, painting, in, the, series, was, caf, terrace, at, night, painted, in, arles, in, early, september, 1888, followed, by, starry, night, over, the, rh, ne, later, that, same, month, van, gogh, s, written, statements, concerning, these, paintings, provide, further, insight, into, his, intentions, for, painting, night, studies, in, general, and, the, starry, night, in, particular, soon, after, he, arrives, in, arles, in, february, 1888, van, gogh, wrote, to, theo, i, need, a, starry, night, with, cypresses, or, perhaps, above, a, field, of, ripe, wheat, there, are, some, really, beautiful, nights, here, that, same, week, he, wrote, to, bernard, a, starry, sky, is, something, i, should, like, to, try, to, do, just, as, in, the, daytime, i, am, going, to, try, to, paint, a, green, meadow, spangled, with, dandelions, he, compared, the, stars, to, dots, on, a, map, and, mused, that, as, one, takes, a, train, to, travel, on, earth, we, take, death, to, reach, a, star, although, at, this, point, in, his, life, van, gogh, was, disillusioned, by, religion, he, appears, not, to, have, lost, his, belief, in, an, afterlife, he, voiced, this, ambivalence, in, a, letter, to, theo, after, having, painted, starry, night, over, the, rh, ne, confessing, to, a, tremendous, need, for, shall, i, say, the, word, for, religion, so, i, go, outside, at, night, to, paint, the, stars, he, wrote, about, existing, in, another, dimension, after, death, and, associated, this, dimension, with, the, night, sky, it, would, be, so, simple, and, would, account, so, much, for, the, terrible, things, in, life, which, now, amaze, and, wound, us, so, if, life, had, yet, another, hemisphere, invisible, it, is, true, but, where, one, lands, when, one, dies, hope, is, in, the, stars, he, wrote, but, he, was, quick, to, point, out, that, this, earth, is, a, planet, too, and, consequently, a, star, or, celestial, orb, and, he, stated, flatly, that, the, starry, night, was, not, a, return, to, the, romantic, or, to, religious, ideas, noted, art, historian, meyer, schapiro, highlights, the, expressionistic, aspects, of, the, starry, night, saying, it, was, created, under, the, pressure, of, feeling, and, that, it, is, a, visionary, inspired, by, a, religious, mood, schapiro, theorizes, that, the, hidden, content, of, the, work, refers, to, the, new, testament, book, of, revelation, revealing, an, apocalyptic, theme, of, the, woman, in, pain, of, birth, girded, with, the, sun, and, moon, and, crowned, with, stars, whose, newborn, child, is, threatened, by, the, dragon, schapiro, in, the, same, volume, also, professes, to, see, an, image, of, a, mother, and, child, in, the, clouds, in, landscape, with, olive, trees, painted, at, the, same, time, and, often, regarded, as, a, pendant, to, the, starry, night, art, historian, sven, loevgren, expands, on, schapiro, s, approach, again, calling, the, starry, night, a, visionary, painting, that, was, conceived, in, a, state, of, great, agitation, he, writes, of, the, hallucinatory, character, of, the, painting, and, its, violently, expressive, form, although, he, takes, pains, to, note, that, the, painting, was, not, executed, during, one, of, van, gogh, s, incapacitating, breakdowns, loevgren, compares, van, gogh, s, religiously, inclined, longing, for, the, beyond, to, the, poetry, of, walt, whitman, he, calls, the, starry, night, an, infinitely, expressive, picture, which, symbolizes, the, final, absorption, of, the, artist, by, the, cosmos, and, which, gives, a, never, to, be, forgotten, sensation, of, standing, on, the, threshold, of, eternity, loevgren, praises, schapiro, s, eloquent, interpretation, of, the, painting, as, an, apocalyptic, vision, and, advances, his, symbolist, theory, concerning, the, eleven, stars, in, one, of, joseph, s, dreams, in, the, old, testament, book, of, genesis, loevgren, asserts, that, the, pictorial, elements, of, the, starry, night, are, visualized, in, purely, symbolic, terms, and, notes, that, the, cypress, is, the, tree, of, death, in, the, mediterranean, countries, art, historian, lauren, soth, also, finds, a, symbolist, subtext, in, the, starry, night, saying, that, the, painting, is, a, traditional, religious, subject, in, disguise, and, a, sublimated, image, of, deepest, religious, feelings, citing, van, gogh, s, avowed, admiration, for, the, paintings, of, eug, ne, delacroix, and, especially, the, earlier, painter, s, use, of, prussian, blue, and, citron, yellow, in, paintings, of, christ, soth, theorizes, that, van, gogh, used, these, colors, to, represent, christ, in, the, starry, night, he, criticizes, schapiro, s, and, loevgren, s, biblical, interpretations, dependent, as, they, are, on, a, reading, of, the, crescent, moon, as, incorporating, elements, of, the, sun, he, says, it, is, merely, a, crescent, moon, which, he, writes, also, had, symbolic, meaning, for, van, gogh, representing, consolation, it, is, in, light, of, such, symbolist, interpretations, of, the, starry, night, that, art, historian, albert, boime, presents, his, study, of, the, painting, as, noted, above, boime, has, proven, that, the, painting, depicts, not, only, the, topographical, elements, of, van, gogh, s, view, from, his, asylum, window, but, also, the, celestial, elements, identifying, not, only, venus, but, also, the, constellation, aries, he, suggests, that, van, gogh, originally, intended, to, paint, a, gibbous, moon, but, reverted, to, a, more, traditional, image, of, the, crescent, moon, and, theorizes, that, the, bright, aureole, around, the, resulting, crescent, is, a, remnant, of, the, original, gibbous, version, he, recounts, van, gogh, s, interest, in, the, writings, of, victor, hugo, and, jules, verne, as, a, possible, inspiration, for, his, belief, in, an, afterlife, on, stars, or, planets, he, provides, a, detailed, discussion, of, the, well, publicized, advances, in, astronomy, that, took, place, during, van, gogh, s, lifetime, boime, asserts, that, while, van, gogh, never, mentioned, astronomer, camille, flammarion, in, his, letters, he, believes, that, van, gogh, must, have, been, aware, of, flammarion, s, popular, illustrated, publications, which, included, drawings, of, spiral, nebulae, as, galaxies, were, then, called, as, seen, and, photographed, through, telescopes, boime, interprets, the, swirling, figure, in, the, central, portion, of, the, sky, in, the, starry, night, to, represent, either, a, spiral, galaxy, or, a, comet, photographs, of, which, had, also, been, published, in, popular, media, he, asserts, that, the, only, non, realistic, elements, of, the, painting, are, the, village, and, the, swirls, in, the, sky, these, swirls, represent, van, gogh, s, understanding, of, the, cosmos, as, a, living, dynamic, place, harvard, astronomer, charles, a, whitney, conducted, his, astronomical, study, of, the, starry, night, contemporaneously, with, but, independent, of, boime, who, spent, almost, his, entire, career, at, u, c, l, a, while, whitney, does, not, share, boime, s, certainty, about, the, constellation, aries, he, concurs, with, boime, on, the, visibility, of, venus, in, provence, at, the, time, the, painting, was, executed, he, also, sees, the, depiction, of, a, spiral, galaxy, in, the, sky, although, he, gives, credit, for, the, original, to, anglo, irish, astronomer, william, parsons, 3rd, earl, of, rosse, whose, work, flammarion, reproduced, whitney, also, theorizes, that, the, swirls, in, the, sky, could, represent, wind, evoking, the, mistral, that, had, such, a, profound, effect, on, van, gogh, during, the, twenty, seven, months, he, spent, in, provence, it, was, the, mistral, which, triggered, his, first, breakdown, after, entering, the, asylum, in, july, 1889, less, than, a, month, after, painting, the, starry, night, boime, theorizes, that, the, lighter, shades, of, blue, just, above, the, horizon, show, the, first, light, of, morning, the, village, has, been, variously, identified, as, either, a, recollection, of, van, gogh, s, dutch, homeland, or, based, on, a, sketch, he, made, of, the, town, of, saint, r, my, in, either, case, it, is, an, imaginary, component, of, the, picture, not, visible, from, the, window, of, the, asylum, bedroom, cypress, trees, have, long, been, associated, with, death, in, european, culture, though, the, question, of, whether, van, gogh, intended, for, them, to, have, such, a, symbolic, meaning, in, the, starry, night, is, the, subject, of, an, open, debate, in, an, april, 1888, letter, to, bernard, van, gogh, referred, to, funereal, cypresses, though, this, is, possibly, similar, to, saying, stately, oaks, or, weeping, willows, one, week, after, painting, the, starry, night, he, wrote, to, his, brother, theo, the, cypresses, are, always, occupying, my, thoughts, i, should, like, to, make, something, of, them, like, the, canvases, of, the, sunflowers, because, it, astonishes, me, that, they, have, not, yet, been, done, as, i, see, them, in, the, same, letter, he, mentioned, two, studies, of, cypresses, of, that, difficult, shade, of, bottle, green, these, statements, suggest, that, van, gogh, was, interested, in, the, trees, more, for, their, formal, qualities, than, for, their, symbolic, connotation, schapiro, refers, to, the, cypress, in, the, painting, as, a, vague, symbol, of, a, human, striving, boime, calls, it, the, symbolic, counterpart, of, van, gogh, s, own, striving, for, the, infinite, through, non, orthodox, channels, art, historian, vojtech, jirat, wasiutynski, says, that, for, van, gogh, the, cypresses, function, as, rustic, and, natural, obelisks, providing, a, link, between, the, heavens, and, the, earth, some, commentators, see, one, tree, others, see, two, or, more, loevgren, reminds, the, reader, that, the, cypress, is, the, tree, of, death, in, the, mediterranean, countries, art, historian, ronald, pickvance, says, that, with, its, arbitrary, collage, of, separate, motifs, the, starry, night, is, overtly, stamped, as, an, abstraction, pickvance, claims, that, cypress, trees, were, not, visible, facing, east, from, van, gogh, s, room, and, he, includes, them, with, the, village, and, the, swirls, in, the, sky, as, products, of, van, gogh, s, imagination, boime, asserts, that, the, cypresses, were, visible, in, the, east, as, does, jirat, wasiuty, ski, van, gogh, biographers, steven, naifeh, and, gregory, white, smith, concur, saying, that, van, gogh, telescoped, the, view, in, certain, of, the, pictures, of, the, view, from, his, window, and, it, stands, to, reason, that, van, gogh, would, do, this, in, a, painting, featuring, the, morning, star, such, a, compression, of, depth, serves, to, enhance, the, brightness, of, the, planet, soth, uses, van, gogh, s, statement, to, his, brother, that, the, starry, night, is, an, exaggeration, from, the, point, of, view, of, arrangement, to, further, his, argument, that, the, painting, is, an, amalgam, of, images, however, it, is, by, no, means, certain, that, van, gogh, was, using, arrangement, as, a, synonym, for, composition, van, gogh, was, speaking, of, three, paintings, one, of, which, was, the, starry, night, when, he, made, this, comment, the, olive, trees, with, white, cloud, and, background, of, mountains, as, well, as, the, moonrise, and, the, night, effect, as, he, called, it, these, are, exaggerations, from, the, point, of, view, of, the, arrangement, their, lines, are, contorted, like, those, of, the, ancient, woodcuts, the, first, two, pictures, are, universally, acknowledged, to, be, realistic, non, composite, views, of, their, subjects, what, the, three, pictures, do, have, in, common, is, exaggerated, color, and, brushwork, of, the, type, that, theo, referred, to, when, he, criticized, van, gogh, for, his, search, for, style, takes, away, the, real, sentiment, of, things, in, the, starry, night, on, two, other, occasions, around, this, time, van, gogh, used, the, word, arrangement, to, refer, to, color, similar, to, the, way, james, abbott, mcneill, whistler, used, the, term, in, a, letter, to, gauguin, in, january, 1889, he, wrote, as, an, arrangement, of, colours, the, reds, moving, through, to, pure, oranges, intensifying, even, more, in, the, flesh, tones, up, to, the, chromes, passing, into, the, pinks, and, marrying, with, the, olive, and, veronese, greens, as, an, impressionist, arrangement, of, colours, i, ve, never, devised, anything, better, the, painting, he, is, referring, to, is, la, berceuse, which, is, a, realistic, portrait, of, augustine, roulin, with, an, imaginative, floral, background, and, to, bernard, in, late, november, 1889, but, this, is, enough, for, you, to, understand, that, i, would, long, to, see, things, of, yours, again, like, the, painting, of, yours, that, gauguin, has, those, breton, women, walking, in, a, meadow, the, arrangement, of, which, is, so, beautiful, the, colour, so, naively, distinguished, ah, you, re, exchanging, that, for, something, must, one, say, the, word, something, artificial, something, affected, while, stopping, short, of, calling, the, painting, a, hallucinatory, vision, naifeh, and, smith, discuss, the, starry, night, in, the, context, of, van, gogh, s, mental, illness, which, they, identify, as, temporal, lobe, epilepsy, or, latent, epilepsy, not, the, kind, they, write, known, since, antiquity, that, caused, the, limbs, to, jerk, and, the, body, to, collapse, the, falling, sickness, as, it, was, sometimes, called, but, a, mental, epilepsy, a, seizing, up, of, the, mind, a, collapse, of, thought, perception, reason, and, emotion, that, manifested, itself, entirely, in, the, brain, and, often, prompted, bizarre, dramatic, behavior, symptoms, of, the, seizures, resembled, fireworks, of, electrical, impulses, in, the, brain, van, gogh, experienced, his, second, breakdown, in, seven, months, in, july, 1889, naifeh, and, smith, theorize, that, the, seeds, of, this, breakdown, were, present, when, van, gogh, painted, the, starry, night, that, in, giving, himself, over, to, his, imagination, his, defenses, had, been, breached, on, that, day, in, mid, june, in, a, state, of, heightened, reality, with, all, the, other, elements, of, the, painting, in, place, van, gogh, threw, himself, into, the, painting, of, the, stars, producing, they, write, a, night, sky, unlike, any, other, the, world, had, ever, seen, with, ordinary, eyes, the, painting, echoes, his, thoughts, and, the, state, of, mind, he, was, in,
