a, megalith, is, a, large, stone, that, has, been, used, to, construct, a, prehistoric, structure, or, monument, either, alone, or, together, with, other, stones, there, are, over, 35, 000, structures, or, arrangements, in, europe, alone, located, widely, from, sweden, to, the, mediterranean, sea, the, word, was, first, used, in, 1849, by, the, british, antiquarian, algernon, herbert, in, reference, to, stonehenge, and, derives, from, the, ancient, greek, words, mega, for, great, and, lithos, for, stone, most, extant, megaliths, were, erected, between, the, neolithic, period, although, earlier, mesolithic, examples, are, known, through, the, chalcolithic, period, and, into, the, bronze, age, while, megalith, is, often, used, to, describe, a, single, piece, of, stone, it, also, can, be, used, to, denote, one, or, more, rocks, hewn, in, definite, shapes, for, special, purposes, it, has, been, used, to, describe, structures, built, by, people, from, many, parts, of, the, world, living, in, many, different, periods, the, most, widely, known, megaliths, are, not, tombs, the, most, common, type, of, megalithic, construction, in, europe, is, the, portal, tomb, a, chamber, consisting, of, upright, stones, orthostats, with, one, or, more, large, flat, capstones, forming, a, roof, many, portal, tombs, have, been, found, to, contain, human, remains, but, it, is, debated, if, their, primary, function, was, use, as, burial, sites, the, megalithic, structures, in, the, northwest, of, france, are, believed, to, be, the, oldest, in, europe, based, on, radiocarbon, dating, though, generally, known, as, dolmens, the, term, most, accepted, by, archaeologists, is, portal, tomb, local, names, for, portal, tombs, exist, in, multiple, locations, such, as, anta, in, galicia, and, portugal, stazzone, in, sardinia, hunebed, in, the, netherlands, h, nengrab, in, germany, dysse, in, denmark, and, cromlech, in, wales, it, is, assumed, that, most, portal, tombs, were, originally, covered, by, earthen, mounds, the, second, most, common, tomb, type, is, the, passage, grave, it, normally, consists, of, a, square, circular, or, cruciform, chamber, with, a, slabbed, or, corbelled, roof, accessed, by, a, long, straight, passageway, with, the, whole, structure, covered, by, a, circular, mound, of, earth, sometimes, it, is, also, surrounded, by, an, external, stone, kerb, prominent, examples, include, the, sites, of, br, na, b, inne, and, carrowmore, in, ireland, maes, howe, in, orkney, and, gavrinis, in, france, the, third, tomb, type, is, a, diverse, group, known, as, gallery, graves, these, are, axially, arranged, chambers, placed, under, elongated, mounds, the, irish, court, tombs, british, long, barrows, and, german, steinkisten, belong, to, this, group, standing, stones, or, menhirs, as, they, are, known, in, france, are, very, common, throughout, europe, where, some, 50, 000, examples, have, been, noted, some, of, these, are, thought, to, have, an, astronomical, function, as, a, marker, or, foresight, in, some, areas, long, and, complex, alignments, of, such, stones, exist, the, largest, known, example, being, located, at, carnac, in, brittany, france, in, parts, of, britain, and, ireland, a, relatively, common, type, of, megalithic, construction, is, the, stone, circle, of, which, examples, include, stonehenge, avebury, ring, of, brodgar, and, beltany, these, too, display, evidence, of, astronomical, alignments, both, solar, and, lunar, stonehenge, for, example, is, famous, for, its, solstice, alignment, examples, of, stone, circles, are, also, found, in, the, rest, of, europe, the, circle, at, lough, gur, near, limerick, in, ireland, has, been, dated, to, the, beaker, period, approximately, contemporaneous, with, stonehenge, the, stone, circles, are, assumed, to, be, of, later, date, than, the, tombs, straddling, the, neolithic, and, the, bronze, ages, megalithic, tombs, are, aboveground, burial, chambers, built, of, large, stone, slabs, megaliths, laid, on, edge, and, covered, with, earth, or, other, smaller, stones, they, are, a, type, of, chamber, tomb, and, the, term, is, used, to, describe, the, structures, built, across, atlantic, europe, the, mediterranean, and, neighbouring, regions, mostly, during, the, neolithic, period, by, neolithic, farming, communities, they, differ, from, the, contemporary, long, barrows, through, their, structural, use, of, stone, there, is, a, huge, variety, of, megalithic, tombs, the, free, standing, single, chamber, dolmens, and, portal, dolmens, found, in, brittany, denmark, germany, ireland, netherlands, sweden, wales, and, elsewhere, consist, of, a, large, flat, stone, supported, by, three, four, or, more, standing, stones, they, were, covered, by, a, stone, cairn, or, earth, barrow, in, italy, dolmens, can, be, found, especially, in, sardinia, there, are, more, than, 100, dolmen, dating, to, the, neolithic, 3500, 2700, bc, and, the, most, famous, is, called, dolmen, di, sa, coveccada, near, mores, during, the, bronze, age, the, nuragic, civilization, built, c, 800, giants, grave, a, type, of, megalithic, gallery, grave, that, can, be, found, throughout, sardinia, with, different, structures, the, earliest, megalithic, tombs, in, sardinia, are, the, circular, graves, of, the, so, called, arzachena, culture, also, found, in, corsica, southern, france, and, eastern, spain, dolmens, are, also, in, apulia, and, in, sicily, in, this, latter, region, they, are, small, structures, located, in, mura, pregne, palermo, sciacca, agrigento, monte, bubbonia, caltanissetta, butera, caltanissetta, cava, lazzaro, siracusa, cava, dei, servi, ragusa, avola, siracusa, and, argimusco, in, montalbano, elicona, messina, dating, to, the, early, bronze, age, 2200, 1800, bc, the, prehistoric, sicilian, buildings, were, covered, by, a, circular, mound, of, earth, in, the, dolmen, of, cava, dei, servi, archaeologists, found, numerous, human, bone, fragments, and, some, splinters, of, castelluccian, ceramics, early, bronze, age, which, confirmed, the, burial, purpose, of, the, artefact, examples, with, outer, areas, not, used, for, burial, are, also, known, the, court, cairns, of, southwest, scotland, and, northern, ireland, the, severn, cotswold, tombs, of, southwest, england, and, the, transepted, gallery, graves, of, the, loire, region, in, france, share, many, internal, features, although, the, links, between, them, are, not, yet, fully, understood, that, they, often, have, antechambers, or, forecourts, is, thought, to, imply, a, desire, on, the, part, of, the, builders, to, emphasize, a, special, ritual, or, physical, separation, of, the, dead, from, the, living, megalithic, tombs, appear, to, have, been, used, by, communities, for, the, long, term, deposition, of, the, remains, of, their, dead, and, some, seem, to, have, undergone, alteration, and, enlargement, the, organization, and, effort, required, to, erect, these, large, stones, suggest, that, the, societies, concerned, placed, great, emphasis, on, the, proper, treatment, of, their, dead, the, ritual, significance, of, the, tombs, is, supported, by, the, presence, of, pre, historic, art, carved, into, the, stones, at, some, sites, hearths, and, deposits, of, pottery, and, animal, bone, found, by, archaeologists, around, some, tombs, also, implies, that, some, form, of, burial, feast, or, sacrificial, rites, took, place, there, further, examples, of, megalithic, tombs, include, the, stalled, cairn, at, midhowe, in, orkney, and, the, passage, grave, at, bryn, celli, ddu, on, anglesey, there, are, also, extensive, grave, sites, with, up, to, 60, megaliths, at, louisenlund, and, gryet, on, the, danish, island, of, bornholm, despite, its, name, the, stone, tomb, in, ukraine, was, not, a, tomb, but, rather, a, sanctuary, in, association, with, the, megalithic, constructions, across, europe, there, are, often, large, earthworks, of, various, designs, ditches, and, banks, like, the, dorset, cursus, broad, terraces, circular, enclosures, known, as, henges, and, frequently, artificial, mounds, such, as, silbury, hill, in, england, and, monte, d, accoddi, in, sardinia, the, prehistoric, step, pyramid, in, europe, megaliths, are, in, general, constructions, erected, during, the, neolithic, or, late, stone, age, and, chalcolithic, or, copper, age, 4500, 1500, bc, the, megalithic, structures, of, malta, are, believed, to, be, the, oldest, in, europe, perhaps, the, most, famous, megalithic, structure, is, stonehenge, in, england, in, sardinia, in, addition, to, dolmens, menhirs, and, circular, graves, there, are, also, more, than, 8000, megalithic, structures, made, by, a, nuragic, civilisation, called, nuraghe, buildings, similar, to, towers, sometimes, with, really, complex, structures, made, using, only, rocks, they, are, often, near, giant, s, grave, or, the, other, megalithic, monuments, the, french, comte, de, caylus, was, the, first, to, describe, the, carnac, stones, pierre, jean, baptiste, legrand, d, aussy, introduced, the, terms, menhir, and, dolmen, both, taken, from, the, breton, language, into, antiquarian, terminology, he, mistakenly, interpreted, megaliths, as, gallic, tombs, in, britain, the, antiquarians, aubrey, and, stukeley, conducted, early, research, into, megaliths, in, 1805, jacques, cambry, published, a, book, called, monuments, celtiques, ou, recherches, sur, le, culte, des, pierres, pr, c, d, es, d, une, notice, sur, les, celtes, et, sur, les, druides, et, suivies, d, etymologie, celtiques, where, he, proposed, a, celtic, stone, cult, this, unproven, connection, between, druids, and, megaliths, has, haunted, the, public, imagination, ever, since, in, belgium,

turning, the, dead, in, present, day, megalithic, burials, are, found, in, northeast, and, southeast, asia, they, are, found, mainly, in, the, korean, peninsula, they, are, also, found, in, the, liaoning, shandong, and, zhejiang, in, china, the, east, coast, of, taiwan, ky, sh, and, shikoku, in, japan, ng, nai, province, in, vietnam, and, south, asia, some, living, megalithic, traditions, are, found, on, the, island, of, sumba, and, nias, in, indonesia, the, greatest, concentration, of, megalithic, burials, is, in, korea, archaeologists, estimate, that, there, are, 15, 000, to, 100, 000, southern, megaliths, in, the, korean, peninsula, typical, estimates, hover, around, the, 30, 000, mark, for, the, entire, peninsula, which, in, itself, constitutes, some, 40, of, all, dolmens, worldwide, see, dolmen, northeast, asian, megalithic, traditions, originated, from, gojoseon, which, was, in, modern, day, manchuria, and, north, korea, this, was, prominent, within, the, liao, river, basin, in, particular, in, the, early, phases, the, practice, of, erecting, megalithic, burials, spread, quickly, from, the, liao, river, basin, and, into, the, korean, peninsula, where, the, structure, of, megaliths, is, geographically, and, chronologically, distinct, the, earliest, megalithic, burials, are, called, northern, or, table, style, because, they, feature, an, above, ground, burial, chamber, formed, by, heavy, stone, slabs, that, form, a, rectangular, cist, an, oversized, capstone, is, placed, over, the, stone, slab, burial, chamber, giving, the, appearance, of, a, table, top, these, megalithic, burials, date, to, the, early, part, of, the, mumun, pottery, period, c, 1500, 850, bc, and, are, distributed, with, a, few, exceptions, north, of, the, han, river, few, northern, style, megaliths, in, north, korea, and, manchuria, contain, grave, goods, such, as, liaoning, bronze, daggers, prompting, some, archaeologists, to, interpret, the, burials, as, the, graves, of, chiefs, or, preeminent, individuals, however, whether, a, result, of, grave, robbery, or, intentional, mortuary, behaviour, most, northern, megaliths, contain, no, grave, goods, southern, style, megalithic, burials, are, distributed, in, the, southern, korean, peninsula, it, is, thought, that, most, of, them, date, to, the, latter, part, of, the, early, mumun, or, to, the, middle, mumun, period, southern, style, megaliths, are, typically, smaller, in, scale, than, northern, megaliths, the, interment, area, of, southern, megaliths, has, an, underground, burial, chamber, made, of, earth, or, lined, with, thin, stone, slabs, a, massive, capstone, is, placed, over, the, interment, area, and, is, supported, by, smaller, propping, stones, most, of, the, megalithic, burials, on, the, korean, peninsula, are, of, the, southern, type, as, with, northern, megaliths, southern, examples, contain, few, if, any, artifacts, however, a, small, number, of, megalithic, burials, contain, fine, red, burnished, pottery, bronze, daggers, polished, groundstone, daggers, and, greenstone, ornaments, southern, megalithic, burials, are, often, found, in, groups, spread, out, in, lines, that, are, parallel, with, the, direction, of, streams, megalithic, cemeteries, contain, burials, that, are, linked, together, by, low, stone, platforms, made, from, large, river, cobbles, broken, red, burnished, pottery, and, charred, wood, found, on, these, platforms, has, led, archaeologists, to, hypothesize, that, these, platform, were, sometimes, used, for, ceremonies, and, rituals, the, capstones, of, many, southern, megaliths, have, cup, marks, carvings, a, small, number, of, capstones, have, human, and, dagger, representations, these, megaliths, are, distinguished, from, other, types, by, the, presence, of, a, burial, shaft, sometimes, up, to, 4, m, in, depth, which, is, lined, with, large, cobbles, a, large, capstone, is, placed, over, the, burial, shaft, without, propping, stones, capstone, style, megaliths, are, the, most, monumental, type, in, the, korean, peninsula, and, they, are, primarily, distributed, near, or, on, the, south, coast, of, korea, it, seems, that, most, of, these, burials, date, to, the, latter, part, of, the, middle, mumun, c, 700, 550, bc, and, they, may, have, been, built, into, the, early, part, of, the, late, mumun, an, example, is, found, near, modern, changwon, at, deokcheon, ni, where, a, small, cemetery, contained, a, capstone, burial, no, 1, with, a, massive, rectangularly, shaped, stone, and, earthen, platform, archaeologists, were, not, able, to, recover, the, entire, feature, but, the, low, platform, was, at, least, 56, 18, m, in, size, the, indonesian, archipelago, is, the, host, of, austronesian, and, melanesians, megalith, cultures, both, past, and, present, living, megalith, cultures, can, be, found, on, nias, an, isolated, island, off, the, western, coast, of, north, sumatra, the, batak, people, in, the, interior, of, north, sumatra, on, flores, and, sumba, island, in, east, nusa, tenggara, and, also, toraja, people, from, the, interior, of, south, sulawesi, these, megalith, cultures, remained, preserved, isolated, and, undisturbed, well, into, the, late, 19th, century, several, megalith, sites, and, structures, are, also, found, across, indonesia, menhirs, dolmens, stone, tables, and, ancestral, stone, statues, were, discovered, in, various, sites, in, java, sumatra, sulawesi, lesser, sunda, islands, and, new, guinea, the, cipari, megalith, site, also, in, west, java, displays, monoliths, stone, terraces, and, sarcophagi, lore, lindu, national, park, in, central, sulawesi, houses, ancient, megalith, relics, such, as, ancestral, stone, statues, mostly, located, in, the, bada, besoa, and, napu, valleys, megaliths, in, south, asia, are, dated, before, 3000, bc, with, recent, findings, dated, back, to, 5000, bc, in, southern, india, megaliths, are, found, in, almost, all, parts, of, south, asia, there, is, also, a, broad, time, evolution, with, the, megaliths, in, central, india, and, the, upper, indus, valley, where, the, oldest, megaliths, are, found, while, those, in, the, east, also, old, shows, evidence, of, continued, traditions, of, living, megalithic, practices, until, recently, a, large, fraction, of, these, are, assumed, to, be, associated, with, burial, or, post, burial, rituals, including, memorials, for, those, whose, remains, may, or, may, not, be, available, the, case, example, is, that, of, brahmagiri, which, was, excavated, by, wheeler, 1975, and, helped, establish, the, culture, sequence, in, south, indian, prehistory, however, there, is, another, distinct, class, of, megaliths, that, do, not, seem, to, be, associated, with, burials, in, south, asia, megaliths, of, all, kinds, are, noted, these, vary, from, menhirs, rock, cut, burial, chamber, tomb, dolmens, stone, alignment, stone, circles, and, anthropomorphic, statue, figures, these, are, broadly, classified, into, two, potentially, overlapping, classes, after, moorti, 1994, 2008, sepulchral, containing, remains, of, the, dead, or, memorial, stones, where, mortal, remains, along, with, funerary, objects, are, placed, and, non, sepulchral, including, large, patterned, placement, of, stones, over, a, wide, area, the, non, sepulchral, type, is, associated, with, astronomy, and, cosmology, in, south, asia, and, in, other, parts, of, the, world, menon, and, vahia, 2010, in, the, context, of, prehistoric, anthropomorphic, figures, in, india, rao, 1988, 1999, upinder, singh, 2008, note, that, it, is, unclear, what, these, giant, anthropomorph, statues, symbolize, they, usually, occur, in, association, with, megalithic, monuments, and, are, located, in, megalithic, burial, grounds, and, may, have, been, connected, with, ancestor, worship, at, a, number, of, sites, in, southeastern, turkey, ceremonial, complexes, with, large, t, shaped, megalithic, orthostats, dating, from, the, pre, pottery, neolithic, ppn, c, 9600, 7000, cal, bc, have, been, discovered, at, the, most, famous, of, these, sites, g, bekli, tepe, parts, of, the, oldest, level, iii, have, been, c14, dated, as, far, back, as, to, the, mid, 10th, millennium, bc, cal, on, this, level, 20, great, stone, circles, up, to, 20, meters, in, diameter, with, standing, stones, up, to, 7, meters, high, have, been, identified, at, least, 5, of, these, circles, have, so, far, as, of, 2019, been, excavated, many, of, the, standing, stones, are, richly, ornamented, with, carved, reliefs, of, ears, boars, snakes, foxes, wildcats, aurochs, gazelle, quadruped, reptiles, birds, spiders, insects, quadrupeds, scorpions, and, other, animals, in, addition, some, of, the, stones, are, carved, in, low, profile, with, stylized, human, features, arms, hands, loincloths, but, no, heads, on, the, younger, level, ii, rectangular, structures, with, smaller, megaliths, have, been, excavated, in, the, surrounding, area, several, village, sites, incorporating, elements, similar, to, those, of, g, bekli, tepe, have, been, identified, four, of, these, have, g, bekli, tepe, s, characteristic, t, shaped, standing, stones, though, only, one, of, them, neval, ori, has, so, far, been, excavated, at, g, bekli, tepe, itself, no, traces, of, habitation, have, so, far, been, found, nor, any, trace, of, agriculture, or, cultivated, plants, though, bones, of, wild, animals, and, traces, of, wild, edible, plants, along, with, many, grinding, stones, have, been, unearthed, it, is, thus, assumed, that, these, structures, which, have, been, characterized, as, the, first, known, ceremonial, architecture, were, erected, by, hunter, gatherers, g, bekli, tepe, s, oldest, structures, are, about, 7, 000, years, older, than, the, stonehenge, megaliths, although, it, is, doubtful, that, any, of, the, european, megalithic, traditions, see, below, are, derived, from, them, dolmens, and, standing, stones, have, been, found, in, large, areas, in, other, parts, of, west, asia, starting, at, the, turkish, border, in, the, north, of, syria, close, to, aleppo, southwards, down, to, yemen, they, can, be, encountered, in, lebanon, syria, iran, israel, jordan, and, saudi, arabia, the, largest, concentration, can, be, found, in, southern, syria, and, along, the, jordan, rift, valley, these, are, threatened, with, destruction, they, date, from, the, late, chalcolithic, or, early, bronze, age, megaliths, have, also, been, found, on, kharg, island, and, pirazmian, in, iran, at, barda, balka, in, iraq, a, semicircular, arrangement, of, megaliths, was, found, in, israel, at, atlit, yam, a, site, that, is, now, under, the, sea, it, is, a, very, early, example, dating, from, the, 7th, millennium, bc, the, most, concentrated, occurrence, of, dolmens, in, particular, is, in, a, large, area, on, both, sides, of, the, jordan, rift, valley, with, greater, predominance, on, the, eastern, side, they, occur, first, and, foremost, on, the, golan, heights, the, hauran, and, in, jordan, which, probably, has, the, largest, concentration, of, dolmen, in, west, asia, in, saudi, arabia, only, very, few, dolmen, have, been, identified, so, far, in, the, hejaz, they, seem, however, to, re, emerge, in, yemen, in, small, numbers, and, thus, could, indicate, a, continuous, tradition, related, to, those, of, somalia, and, ethiopia, the, standing, stone, has, a, very, ancient, tradition, in, west, asia, dating, back, from, mesopotamian, times, although, not, always, megalithic, in, the, true, sense, they, occur, throughout, the, area, and, can, reach, 5, metres, or, more, in, some, cases, such, as, at, ader, in, jordan, this, phenomenon, can, also, be, traced, through, many, passages, from, the, old, testament, such, as, those, related, to, jacob, the, grandson, of, abraham, who, poured, oil, over, a, stone, that, he, erected, after, his, famous, dream, in, which, angels, climbed, to, heaven, genesis, 28, 10, 22, jacob, is, also, described, as, putting, up, stones, at, other, occasions, whereas, moses, erected, twelve, pillars, symbolizing, the, tribes, of, israel, the, tradition, of, venerating, standing, stones, continued, in, nabatean, times, related, phenomena, such, as, cupholes, rock, cut, tombs, and, circles, also, occur, in, west, asia, megaliths, occur, in, many, parts, of, melanesia, mainly, in, milne, bay, province, fiji, and, vanuatu, few, excavations, have, been, made, and, little, is, known, about, the, structures, the, megalith, tomb, otuyam, at, kiriwina, has, been, dated, to, be, approximately, 2, 000, years, old, which, indicates, that, megaliths, are, an, old, custom, in, melanesia, however, very, few, megaliths, have, been, dated, the, constructions, have, been, used, for, different, rituals, for, example, tombs, sacrifices, and, rituals, of, fecundity, dance, sites, exist, next, to, some, megaliths, in, some, places, in, melanesia, rituals, are, continued, to, be, held, at, the, sacred, megalith, sites, the, fact, that, the, beliefs, are, alive, is, a, reason, that, most, excavations, have, been, stopped, at, the, sites, megalithic, structures, in, micronesia, reach, their, most, developed, form, on, the, islands, of, pohnpei, and, kosrae, in, the, eastern, caroline, islands, on, these, two, islands, there, was, extensive, use, of, prismatic, basalt, columns, to, build, upland, building, complexes, such, as, those, at, salapwuk, on, pohnpei, and, menka, on, kosrae, these, building, sites, remote, from, the, ocean, appear, to, have, been, abandoned, early, megalithic, building, then, shifted, to, constructing, networks, of, artificial, islands, on, the, coast, that, supported, a, multitude, of, common, royal, and, religious, structures, dating, of, the, structures, is, difficult, but, the, complex, at, nan, madol, on, pohnpei, was, probably, inhabited, as, early, as, c, 800, probably, as, artificial, islands, with, the, more, elaborate, buildings, and, religious, structures, added, to, the, site, from, 1000, to, 1400, ad, megaliths, were, used, for, a, variety, of, purposes, ranging, from, serving, as, boundary, markers, of, territory, being, reminder, of, past, events, to, being, part, of, the, society, s, religion, common, motifs, including, crooks, and, axes, seem, to, be, symbols, of, political, power, much, as, the, crook, was, a, symbol, of, egyptian, pharaohs, amongst, the, indigenous, peoples, of, india, malaysia, polynesia, north, africa, north, america, and, south, america, the, worship, of, these, stones, or, the, use, of, these, stones, to, symbolize, a, spirit, or, deity, is, a, possibility, in, the, early, 20th, century, some, scholars, believed, that, all, megaliths, belonged, to, one, global, megalithic, culture, hyperdiffusionism, e, g, the, manchester, school, by, grafton, elliot, smith, and, william, james, perry, but, this, has, long, been, disproved, by, modern, dating, methods, nor, is, it, believed, any, longer, that, there, was, a, pan, european, megalithic, culture, although, regional, cultures, existed, even, within, such, small, areas, as, the, british, isles, the, archaeologist, euan, mackie, wrote, likewise, it, cannot, be, doubted, that, important, regional, cultures, existed, in, the, neolithic, period, and, can, be, defined, by, different, kinds, of, stone, circles, and, local, pottery, styles, ruggles, barclay, 2000, figure, 1, no, one, has, ever, been, rash, enough, to, claim, a, nationwide, unity, of, all, aspects, of, neolithic, archaeology, much, scholarship, over, history, has, suggested, that, stone, age, peoples, moved, the, large, stones, on, cylindrical, wooden, rollers, however, there, is, some, disagreement, with, this, theory, specifically, as, experiments, have, indicated, that, this, method, is, impractical, on, uneven, ground, in, some, contemporary, megalith, building, cultures, such, as, in, sumba, indonesia, great, emphasis, is, placed, on, the, social, status, of, moving, heavy, stones, without, the, relief, of, rollers, in, the, majority, of, documented, contemporary, megalithic, building, communities, the, stones, have, been, placed, on, timber, sledges, and, dragged, without, rollers, the, types, of, megalithic, structure, can, be, divided, into, two, categories, the, polylithic, type, and, the, monolithic, type, different, megalithic, structures, include, the, megalithic, culture, of, the, toraja, people, in, the, mountainous, region, of, south, sulawesi, indonesia, dates, back, to, around, 2500, 1000, bc, in, west, sumba, indonesia, the, more, than, 20, 000, followers, of, the, marapu, animist, religion, construct, monolithic, tombs, by, hand, originally, built, with, slave, labor, the, large, tombs, of, nobles, are, now, built, by, a, class, of, dependents, who, are, paid, either, in, animals, or, cash, an, amount, equal, to, 0, 65, 0, 90, per, day, the, tombs, are, planned, long, in, advance, with, families, sometimes, going, into, extreme, debt, to, finance, the, construction, in, 1971, one, leading, family, sacrificed, 350, buffalo, over, the, course, of, a, year, in, order, to, feed, the, 1, 000, people, necessary, to, drag, the, capstone, 3, km, from, the, quarry, to, the, tombsite, quarrying, the, stones, for, a, tomb, can, take, almost, a, month, and, typically, involves, 20, 40, laborours, sometimes, subcontracted, by, a, relative, it, can, be, months, or, years, before, the, stones, are, actually, transported, to, the, gravesite, which, is, done, traditionally, by, hand, using, a, wooden, sled, and, rollers, with, the, help, of, many, members, of, the, family, s, clan, building, the, sled, itself, can, take, several, days, and, typically, males, between, the, ages, of, 10, 60, are, assembled, to, pull, the, stone, from, the, quarry, to, the, tombsite, smaller, capstones, may, be, moved, by, a, few, hundred, members, of, a, clan, but, larger, ones, can, involve, upwards, of, 2, 000, individuals, over, many, days, sometimes, the, stones, are, draped, with, woven, cloths, given, as, gifts, by, relatives, of, the, owner, the, sidewalls, are, smaller, and, usually, require, fewer, participants, the, entire, process, is, accompanied, by, large, feasts, and, ritual, singers, provided, by, the, owner, some, contemporary, practitioners, now, choose, to, use, large, machinery, and, trucks, to, move, the, stones, once, on, site, the, stones, were, traditionally, assembled, and, mortared, with, a, mix, of, water, buffalo, dung, and, ash, but, are, now, more, commonly, cemented, together, typically, the, walls, are, assembled, first, and, then, the, capstone, is, incrementally, elevated, to, the, height, of, the, walls, by, means, of, a, wood, scaffolding, which, is, inserted, log, by, log, at, alternating, ends, once, the, capstone, is, at, the, correct, height, beside, the, walls, it, is, slid, into, place, above, the, tomb, alternately, some, tombs, are, constructed, by, dragging, the, capstone, up, a, fabricated, ramp, and, then, assembling, the, sidewalls, below, it, before, removing, the, ramp, structure, to, let, the, capstone, rest, upon, the, walls, often, but, not, always, the, finished, structure, is, decorated, by, a, professional, stone, carver, with, symbolic, motifs, the, carving, alone, can, at, times, take, over, a, month, to, complete, and, moses, wrote, down, all, the, words, of, the, lord, he, rose, early, in, the, morning, and, built, an, altar, at, the, foot, of, the, mountain, and, twelve, pillars, according, to, the, twelve, tribes, of, israel
