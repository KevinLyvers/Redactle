the, seven, wonders, of, the, ancient, world, also, known, as, the, seven, wonders, of, the, world, or, simply, the, seven, wonders, is, a, list, of, seven, notable, structures, present, during, classical, antiquity, the, first, known, list, of, seven, wonders, dates, back, to, the, 2nd, 1st, century, bc, while, the, entries, have, varied, over, the, centuries, the, seven, traditional, wonders, are, the, great, pyramid, of, giza, the, colossus, of, rhodes, the, lighthouse, of, alexandria, the, mausoleum, at, halicarnassus, the, temple, of, artemis, the, statue, of, zeus, at, olympia, and, the, hanging, gardens, of, babylon, using, modern, day, countries, two, of, the, wonders, were, located, in, greece, two, in, turkey, two, in, egypt, and, one, in, iraq, of, the, seven, wonders, only, the, pyramid, of, giza, which, is, also, by, far, the, oldest, of, the, wonders, still, remains, standing, while, the, others, have, been, destroyed, over, the, centuries, there, is, scholarly, debate, over, the, exact, nature, of, the, hanging, gardens, and, there, is, doubt, as, to, whether, they, existed, at, all, alexander, the, great, s, conquest, of, much, of, the, western, world, in, the, 4th, century, bc, gave, hellenistic, travellers, access, to, the, civilizations, of, the, egyptians, persians, and, babylonians, impressed, and, captivated, by, the, landmarks, and, marvels, of, the, various, lands, these, travellers, began, to, list, what, they, saw, to, remember, them, instead, of, wonders, the, ancient, greeks, spoke, of, theamata, which, means, sights, in, other, words, things, to, be, seen, t, hept, the, mata, t, s, oikoumen, s, later, the, word, for, wonder, thaumata, wonders, was, used, hence, the, list, was, meant, to, be, the, ancient, world, s, counterpart, of, a, travel, guidebook, the, first, reference, to, a, list, of, seven, such, monuments, was, given, by, diodorus, siculus, the, epigrammist, antipater, of, sidon, who, lived, around, or, before, 100, bc, gave, a, list, of, seven, wonders, including, six, of, the, present, list, substituting, the, walls, of, babylon, for, the, lighthouse, of, alexandria, i, have, gazed, on, the, walls, of, impregnable, babylon, along, which, chariots, may, race, and, on, the, zeus, by, the, banks, of, the, alpheus, i, have, seen, the, hanging, gardens, and, the, colossus, of, the, helios, the, great, man, made, mountains, of, the, lofty, pyramids, and, the, gigantic, tomb, of, mausolus, but, when, i, saw, the, sacred, house, of, artemis, that, towers, to, the, clouds, the, others, were, placed, in, the, shade, for, the, sun, himself, has, never, looked, upon, its, equal, outside, olympus, another, ancient, writer, who, perhaps, dubiously, identified, himself, as, philo, of, byzantium, wrote, a, short, account, entitled, the, seven, sights, of, the, world, the, surviving, manuscript, is, incomplete, missing, its, last, pages, still, from, the, preamble, text, we, can, conclude, that, the, list, of, seven, sights, exactly, matches, antipater, s, the, preamble, mentions, the, location, of, halicarnassus, but, the, pages, describing, the, seventh, wonder, presumably, the, mausoleum, are, missing, earlier, and, later, lists, by, the, historian, herodotus, c, 484, bc, c, 425, bc, and, the, poet, callimachus, of, cyrene, c, 305, 240, bc, housed, at, the, museum, of, alexandria, survive, only, as, references, the, colossus, of, rhodes, was, the, last, of, the, seven, to, be, completed, after, 280, bc, and, the, first, to, be, destroyed, by, an, earthquake, in, 226, 225, bc, as, such, it, was, already, in, ruins, by, the, time, the, list, was, compiled, and, all, seven, wonders, existed, simultaneously, for, less, than, 60, years, the, list, covered, only, the, mediterranean, and, middle, eastern, regions, which, then, comprised, the, known, world, for, the, greeks, the, primary, accounts, from, hellenistic, writers, also, heavily, influenced, the, places, included, in, the, wonders, list, five, of, the, seven, entries, are, a, celebration, of, greek, accomplishments, in, construction, with, the, exceptions, being, the, pyramids, of, giza, and, the, hanging, gardens, of, babylon, download, coordinates, as, the, seven, wonders, on, antipater, s, list, won, praises, for, their, notable, features, ranging, from, superlatives, of, the, highest, or, largest, of, their, types, to, the, artistry, with, which, they, were, executed, their, architectural, and, artistic, features, were, imitated, throughout, the, hellenistic, world, and, beyond, the, greek, influence, in, roman, culture, and, the, revival, of, greco, roman, artistic, styles, during, the, renaissance, caught, the, imagination, of, european, artists, and, travellers, paintings, and, sculptures, alluding, to, antipater, s, list, were, made, while, significant, numbers, of, adventurers, travelled, to, the, actual, sites, to, personally, witness, the, wonders, legends, circulated, to, further, complement, the, superlatives, of, the, wonders, of, antipater, s, wonders, the, only, one, that, has, survived, to, the, present, day, is, the, great, pyramid, of, giza, its, brilliant, white, stone, facing, had, survived, intact, until, around, 1300, ad, when, local, communities, removed, most, of, the, stonework, for, building, materials, the, existence, of, the, hanging, gardens, has, not, been, proven, though, theories, abound, records, and, archaeology, confirm, the, existence, of, the, other, five, wonders, the, temple, of, artemis, and, the, statue, of, zeus, were, destroyed, by, fire, while, the, lighthouse, of, alexandria, colossus, and, tomb, of, mausolus, were, destroyed, by, earthquakes, among, the, surviving, artefacts, are, sculptures, from, the, tomb, of, mausolus, and, the, temple, of, artemis, currently, kept, in, the, british, museum, in, london, the, listing, of, seven, of, the, most, marvellous, architectural, and, artistic, human, achievements, continued, beyond, the, ancient, greek, times, to, the, roman, empire, the, middle, ages, the, renaissance, and, to, the, modern, age, the, roman, poet, martial, and, the, christian, bishop, gregory, of, tours, had, their, versions, reflecting, the, rise, of, christianity, and, the, factor, of, time, nature, and, the, hand, of, man, overcoming, antipater, s, seven, wonders, roman,

wonders, list, was, limited, in, its, geographic, scope, also, had, their, versions, to, encompass, sites, beyond, the, hellenistic, realm, from, the, seven, wonders, of, the, ancient, world, to, the, seven, wonders, of, the, world, the, seven, wonders, label, has, spawned, innumerable, versions, among, international, organizations, publications, and, individuals, based, on, different, themes, works, of, nature, engineering, masterpieces, constructions, of, the, middle, ages, etc, its, purpose, has, also, changed, from, just, a, simple, travel, guidebook, or, a, compendium, of, curious,
