printmaking, is, the, process, of, creating, artworks, by, printing, normally, on, paper, but, also, on, fabric, wood, metal, and, other, surfaces, traditional, printmaking, normally, covers, only, the, process, of, creating, prints, using, a, hand, processed, technique, rather, than, a, photographic, reproduction, of, a, visual, artwork, which, would, be, printed, using, an, electronic, machine, a, printer, however, there, is, some, cross, over, between, traditional, and, digital, printmaking, including, risograph, prints, are, created, by, transferring, ink, from, a, matrix, to, a, sheet, of, paper, or, other, material, by, a, variety, of, techniques, common, types, of, matrices, include, metal, plates, for, engraving, etching, and, related, intaglio, printing, techniques, stone, aluminum, or, polymer, for, lithography, blocks, of, wood, for, woodcuts, and, wood, engravings, and, linoleum, for, linocuts, screens, made, of, silk, or, synthetic, fabrics, are, used, for, the, screen, printing, process, other, types, of, matrix, substrates, and, related, processes, are, discussed, below, except, in, the, case, of, monotyping, all, printmaking, processes, have, the, capacity, to, produce, identical, multiples, of, the, same, artwork, which, is, called, a, print, each, print, produced, is, considered, an, original, work, of, art, and, is, correctly, referred, to, as, an, impression, not, a, copy, that, means, a, different, print, copying, the, first, common, in, early, printmaking, however, impressions, can, vary, considerably, whether, intentionally, or, not, master, printmakers, are, technicians, who, are, capable, of, printing, identical, impressions, by, hand, a, print, that, copies, another, work, of, art, especially, a, painting, is, known, as, a, reproductive, print, multiple, impressions, printed, from, the, same, matrix, form, an, edition, since, the, late, 19th, century, artists, have, generally, signed, individual, impressions, from, an, edition, and, often, number, the, impressions, to, form, a, limited, edition, the, matrix, is, then, destroyed, so, that, no, more, prints, can, be, produced, prints, may, also, be, printed, in, book, form, such, as, illustrated, books, or, artist, s, books, printmaking, techniques, are, generally, divided, into, the, following, basic, categories, a, type, of, printmaking, outside, of, this, group, is, viscosity, printing, contemporary, printmaking, may, include, digital, printing, photographic, mediums, or, a, combination, of, digital, photographic, and, traditional, processes, many, of, these, techniques, can, also, be, combined, especially, within, the, same, family, for, example, rembrandt, s, prints, are, usually, referred, to, as, etchings, for, convenience, but, very, often, include, work, in, engraving, and, drypoint, as, well, and, sometimes, have, no, etching, at, all, albrecht, d, rer, hans, burgkmair, ugo, da, carpi, hiroshige, hokusai, frans, masereel, gustave, baumann, ernst, ludwig, kirchner, eric, slater, antonio, frasconi, woodcut, a, type, of, relief, print, is, the, earliest, printmaking, technique, it, was, probably, first, developed, as, a, means, of, printing, patterns, on, cloth, and, by, the, 5th, century, was, used, in, china, for, printing, text, and, images, on, paper, woodcuts, of, images, on, paper, developed, around, 1400, in, japan, and, slightly, later, in, europe, these, are, the, two, areas, where, woodcut, has, been, most, extensively, used, purely, as, a, process, for, making, images, without, text, the, artist, either, draws, a, design, directly, on, a, plank, of, wood, or, transfers, a, drawing, done, on, paper, to, a, plank, of, wood, traditionally, the, artist, then, handed, the, work, to, a, technician, who, then, uses, sharp, carving, tools, to, carve, away, the, parts, of, the, block, that, will, not, receive, ink, in, the, western, tradition, the, surface, of, the, block, is, then, inked, with, the, use, of, a, brayer, however, in, the, japanese, tradition, woodblocks, were, inked, with, a, brush, then, a, sheet, of, paper, perhaps, slightly, damp, is, placed, over, the, block, the, block, is, then, rubbed, with, a, baren, or, spoon, or, is, run, through, a, printing, press, if, the, print, is, in, color, separate, blocks, can, be, used, for, each, color, or, a, technique, called, reduction, printing, can, be, used, reduction, printing, is, a, name, used, to, describe, the, process, of, using, one, block, to, print, several, layers, of, color, on, one, print, both, woodcuts, and, linocuts, can, employ, reduction, printing, this, usually, involves, cutting, a, small, amount, of, the, block, away, and, then, printing, the, block, many, times, over, on, different, sheets, before, washing, the, block, cutting, more, away, and, printing, the, next, color, on, top, this, allows, the, previous, color, to, show, through, this, process, can, be, repeated, many, times, over, the, advantages, of, this, process, is, that, only, one, block, is, needed, and, that, different, components, of, an, intricate, design, will, line, up, perfectly, the, disadvantage, is, that, once, the, artist, moves, on, to, the, next, layer, no, more, prints, can, be, made, another, variation, of, woodcut, printmaking, is, the, cukil, technique, made, famous, by, the, taring, padi, underground, community, in, java, indonesia, taring, padi, posters, usually, resemble, intricately, printed, cartoon, posters, embedded, with, political, messages, images, usually, resembling, a, visually, complex, scenario, are, carved, unto, a, wooden, surface, called, cukilan, then, smothered, with, printer, s, ink, before, pressing, it, unto, media, such, as, paper, or, canvas, the, process, was, developed, in, germany, in, the, 1430s, from, the, engraving, used, by, goldsmiths, to, decorate, metalwork, engravers, use, a, hardened, steel, tool, called, a, burin, to, cut, the, design, into, the, surface, of, a, metal, plate, traditionally, made, of, copper, engraving, using, a, burin, is, generally, a, difficult, skill, to, learn, gravers, come, in, a, variety, of, shapes, and, sizes, that, yield, different, line, types, the, burin, produces, a, unique, and, recognizable, quality, of, line, that, is, characterized, by, its, steady, deliberate, appearance, and, clean, edges, other, tools, such, as, mezzotint, rockers, roulettes, a, tool, with, a, fine, toothed, wheel, and, burnishers, a, tool, used, for, making, an, object, smooth, or, shiny, by, rubbing, are, used, for, texturing, effects, to, make, a, print, the, engraved, plate, is, inked, all, over, then, the, ink, is, wiped, off, the, surface, leaving, ink, only, in, the, engraved, lines, the, plate, is, then, put, through, a, high, pressure, printing, press, together, with, a, sheet, of, paper, often, moistened, to, soften, it, the, paper, picks, up, the, ink, from, the, engraved, lines, making, a, print, the, process, can, be, repeated, many, times, typically, several, hundred, impressions, copies, could, be, printed, before, the, printing, plate, shows, much, sign, of, wear, except, when, drypoint, which, gives, much, shallower, lines, is, used, in, the, 20th, century, true, engraving, was, revived, as, a, serious, art, form, by, artists, including, stanley, william, hayter, whose, atelier, 17, in, paris, and, new, york, city, became, the, magnet, for, such, artists, as, pablo, picasso, alberto, giacometti, mauricio, lasansky, and, joan, mir, albrecht, d, rer, rembrandt, francisco, goya, wenceslaus, hollar, whistler, otto, dix, james, ensor, edward, hopper, k, the, kollwitz, pablo, picasso, cy, twombly, lucas, van, leyden, etching, is, part, of, the, intaglio, family, in, pure, etching, a, metal, plate, usually, copper, zinc, or, steel, is, covered, with, a, waxy, or, acrylic, ground, the, artist, then, draws, through, the, ground, with, a, pointed, etching, needle, exposing, the, metal, the, plate, is, then, etched, by, dipping, it, in, a, bath, of, etchant, e, g, nitric, acid, or, ferric, chloride, the, etchant, bites, into, the, exposed, metal, leaving, behind, lines, in, the, plate, the, remaining, ground, is, then, cleaned, off, the, plate, and, the, printing, process, is, then, just, the, same, as, for, engraving, although, the, first, dated, etching, is, by, albrecht, d, rer, in, 1515, the, process, is, believed, to, have, been, invented, by, daniel, hopfer, c, 1470, 1536, of, augsburg, germany, who, decorated, armor, in, this, way, and, applied, the, method, to, printmaking, etching, soon, came, to, challenge, engraving, as, the, most, popular, printmaking, medium, its, great, advantage, was, that, unlike, engraving, which, requires, special, skill, in, metalworking, etching, is, relatively, easy, to, learn, for, an, artist, trained, in, drawing, etching, prints, are, generally, linear, and, often, contain, fine, detail, and, contours, lines, can, vary, from, smooth, to, sketchy, an, etching, is, opposite, of, a, woodcut, in, that, the, raised, portions, of, an, etching, remain, blank, while, the, crevices, hold, ink, a, non, toxic, form, of, etching, that, does, not, involve, an, acid, is, electroetching, john, martin, ludwig, von, siegen, john, smith, wallerant, vaillant, carol, wax, an, intaglio, variant, of, engraving, in, which, the, image, is, formed, from, subtle, gradations, of, light, and, shade, mezzotint, from, the, italian, mezzo, half, and, tinta, tone, is, a, dark, manner, form, of, printmaking, which, requires, artists, to, work, from, dark, to, light, to, create, a, mezzotint, the, surface, of, a, copper, printing, plate, is, roughened, evenly, all, over, with, the, aid, of, a, tool, known, as, a, rocker, the, image, is, then, formed, by, smoothing, the, surface, with, a, tool, known, as, a, burnisher, when, inked, the, roughened, areas, of, the, plate, will, hold, more, ink, and, print, more, darkly, while, smoother, areas, of, the, plate, hold, less, or, no, ink, and, will, print, more, lightly, or, not, at, all, it, is, however, possible, to, create, the, image, by, only, roughening, the, plate, selectively, so, working, from, light, to, dark, mezzotint, is, known, for, the, luxurious, quality, of, its, tones, first, because, an, evenly, finely, roughened, surface, holds, a, lot, of, ink, allowing, deep, solid, colors, to, be, printed, secondly, because, the, process, of, smoothing, the, texture, with, burin, burnisher, and, scraper, allows, fine, gradations, in, tone, to, be, developed, the, mezzotint, printmaking, method, was, invented, by, ludwig, von, siegen, 1609, 1680, the, process, was, used, widely, in, england, from, the, mid, eighteenth, century, to, reproduce, oil, paintings, and, in, particular, portraits, norman, ackroyd, jean, baptiste, le, prince, william, daniell, francisco, goya, thomas, rowlandson, a, technique, used, in, intaglio, etchings, like, etching, aquatint, technique, involves, the, application, of, acid, to, make, marks, in, a, metal, plate, where, the, etching, technique, uses, a, needle, to, make, lines, that, retain, ink, traditional, aquatint, relies, on, powdered, rosin, which, is, acid, resistant, in, the, ground, to, create, a, tonal, effect, the, rosin, is, applied, in, a, light, dusting, by, a, fan, booth, the, rosin, is, then, cooked, until, set, on, the, plate, at, this, time, the, rosin, can, be, burnished, or, scratched, out, to, affect, its, tonal, qualities, the, tonal, variation, is, controlled, by, the, level, of, acid, exposure, over, large, areas, and, thus, the, image, is, shaped, by, large, sections, at, a, time, contemporary, printmakers, also, sometimes, using, airbrushed, asphaltum, or, spray, paint, as, well, as, other, non, toxic, techniques, to, achieve, aquatint, due, to, rosin, boxes, posing, a, fire, hazard, goya, used, aquatint, for, most, of, his, prints, mary, cassatt, francis, seymour, haden, master, of, the, housebook, richard, spare, william, lionel, wyllie, a, variant, of, engraving, done, with, a, sharp, point, rather, than, a, v, shaped, burin, while, engraved, lines, are, very, smooth, and, hard, edged, drypoint, scratching, leaves, a, rough, burr, at, the, edges, of, each, line, this, burr, gives, drypoint, prints, a, characteristically, soft, and, sometimes, blurry, line, quality, because, the, pressure, of, printing, quickly, destroys, the, burr, drypoint, is, useful, only, for, very, small, editions, as, few, as, ten, or, twenty, impressions, to, counter, this, and, allow, for, longer, print, runs, electro, plating, here, called, steelfacing, has, been, used, since, the, nineteenth, century, to, harden, the, surface, of, a, plate, the, technique, appears, to, have, been, invented, by, the, housebook, master, a, south, german, fifteenth, century, artist, all, of, whose, prints, are, in, drypoint, only, among, the, most, famous, artists, of, the, old, master, print, albrecht, d, rer, produced, three, drypoints, before, abandoning, the, technique, rembrandt, used, it, frequently, but, usually, in, conjunction, with, etching, and, engraving, honor, daumier, vincent, van, gogh, george, bellows, pierre, bonnard, edvard, munch, emil, nolde, pablo, picasso, odilon, redon, henri, de, toulouse, lautrec, salvador, dal, m, c, escher, willem, de, kooning, joan, mir, stow, wengenroth, elaine, de, kooning, louise, nevelson, lithography, is, a, technique, invented, in, 1798, by, alois, senefelder, and, based, on, the, chemical, repulsion, of, oil, and, water, a, porous, surface, normally, limestone, is, used, the, image, is, drawn, on, the, limestone, with, a, greasy, medium, acid, is, applied, transferring, the, grease, protected, design, to, the, limestone, leaving, the, image, burned, into, the, surface, gum, arabic, a, water, soluble, substance, is, then, applied, sealing, the, surface, of, the, stone, not, covered, with, the, drawing, medium, the, stone, is, wetted, with, water, staying, only, on, the, surface, not, covered, in, grease, based, residue, of, the, drawing, the, stone, is, then, rolled, up, meaning, oil, ink, is, applied, with, a, roller, covering, the, entire, surface, since, water, repels, the, oil, in, the, ink, the, ink, adheres, only, to, the, greasy, parts, perfectly, inking, the, image, a, sheet, of, dry, paper, is, placed, on, the, surface, and, the, image, is, transferred, to, the, paper, by, the, pressure, of, the, printing, press, lithography, is, known, for, its, ability, to, capture, fine, gradations, in, shading, and, very, small, detail, photo, lithography, captures, an, image, by, photographic, processes, on, metal, plates, printing, is, more, or, less, carried, out, in, the, same, way, as, stone, lithography, halftone, lithography, produces, an, image, that, illustrates, a, gradient, like, quality, mokulito, is, a, form, of, lithography, on, wood, instead, of, limestone, it, was, invented, by, seishi, ozaku, in, the, 1970s, in, japan, and, was, originally, called, mokurito, josef, albers, ralston, crawford, gene, davis, robert, indiana, roy, lichtenstein, julian, opie, bridget, riley, edward, ruscha, andy, warhol, screen, printing, occasionally, known, as, silkscreen, or, serigraphy, creates, prints, by, using, a, fabric, stencil, technique, ink, is, simply, pushed, through, the, stencil, against, the, surface, of, the, paper, most, often, with, the, aid, of, a, squeegee, generally, the, technique, uses, a, natural, or, synthetic, mesh, fabric, stretched, tightly, across, a, rectangular, frame, much, like, a, stretched, canvas, the, fabric, can, be, silk, nylon, monofilament, multifilament, polyester, or, even, stainless, steel, while, commercial, screen, printing, often, requires, high, tech, mechanical, apparatuses, and, calibrated, materials, printmakers, value, it, for, the, do, it, yourself, approach, and, the, low, technical, requirements, high, quality, results, the, essential, tools, required, are, a, squeegee, a, mesh, fabric, a, frame, and, a, stencil, unlike, many, other, printmaking, processes, a, printing, press, is, not, required, as, screen, printing, is, essentially, stencil, printing, screen, printing, may, be, adapted, to, printing, on, a, variety, of, materials, from, paper, cloth, and, canvas, to, rubber, glass, and, metal, artists, have, used, the, technique, to, print, on, bottles, on, slabs, of, granite, directly, onto, walls, and, to, reproduce, images, on, textiles, which, would, distort, under, pressure, from, printing, presses, monotyping, is, a, type, of, printmaking, made, by, drawing, or, painting, on, a, smooth, non, absorbent, surface, the, surface, or, matrix, was, historically, a, copper, etching, plate, but, in, contemporary, work, it, can, vary, from, zinc, or, glass, to, acrylic, glass, the, image, is, then, transferred, onto, a, sheet, of, paper, by, pressing, the, two, together, usually, using, a, printing, press, monotypes, can, also, be, created, by, inking, an, entire, surface, and, then, using, brushes, or, rags, removing, ink, to, create, a, subtractive, image, e, g, creating, lights, from, a, field, of, opaque, color, the, inks, used, may, be, oil, based, or, water, based, with, oil, based, inks, the, paper, may, be, dry, in, which, case, the, image, has, more, contrast, or, the, paper, may, be, damp, in, which, case, the, image, has, a, 10, percent, greater, range, of, tones, unlike, monoprinting, monotyping, produces, a, unique, print, or, monotype, because, most, of, the, ink, is, removed, during, the, initial, pressing, although, subsequent, reprintings, are, sometimes, possible, they, differ, greatly, from, the, first, print, and, are, generally, considered, inferior, a, second, print, from, the, original, plate, is, called, a, ghost, print, or, cognate, stencils, watercolor, solvents, brushes, and, other, tools, are, often, used, to, embellish, a, monotype, print, monotypes, are, often, spontaneously, executed, and, with, no, preliminary, sketch, monotypes, are, the, most, painterly, method, among, the, printmaking, techniques, a, unique, print, that, is, essentially, a, printed, painting, the, principal, characteristic, of, this, medium, is, found, in, its, spontaneity, and, its, combination, of, printmaking, painting, and, drawing, media, monoprinting, is, a, form, of, printmaking, that, uses, a, matrix, such, as, a, woodblock, litho, stone, or, copper, plate, but, produces, impressions, that, are, unique, multiple, unique, impressions, printed, from, a, single, matrix, are, sometimes, known, as, a, variable, edition, there, are, many, techniques, used, in, monoprinting, including, collagraph, collage, hand, painted, additions, and, a, form, of, tracing, by, which, thick, ink, is, laid, down, on, a, table, paper, is, placed, on, the, ink, and, the, back, of, the, paper, is, drawn, on, transferring, the, ink, to, the, paper, monoprints, can, also, be, made, by, altering, the, type, color, and, viscosity, of, the, ink, used, to, create, different, prints, traditional, printmaking, techniques, such, as, lithography, woodcut, and, intaglio, can, be, used, to, make, monoprints, mixed, media, prints, may, use, multiple, traditional, printmaking, processes, such, as, etching, woodcut, letterpress, silkscreen, or, even, monoprinting, in, the, creation, of, the, print, they, may, also, incorporate, elements, of, chine, colle, collage, or, painted, areas, and, may, be, unique, i, e, one, off, non, editioned, prints, mixed, media, prints, are, often, experimental, prints, and, may, be, printed, on, unusual, non, traditional, surfaces, istvan, horkay, ralph, goings, enrique, chagoya, digital, prints, refers, to, images, printed, using, digital, printers, such, as, inkjet, printers, instead, of, a, traditional, printing, press, images, can, be, printed, to, a, variety, of, substrates, including, paper, cloth, or, plastic, canvas, dye, based, inks, are, organic, not, mineral, dissolved, and, mixed, into, a, liquid, although, most, are, synthetic, derived, from, petroleum, they, can, be, made, from, vegetable, or, animal, sources, dyes, are, well, suited, for, textiles, where, the, liquid, dye, penetrates, and, chemically, bonds, to, the, fiber, because, of, the, deep, penetration, more, layers, of, material, must, lose, their, color, before, the, fading, is, apparent, dyes, however, are, not, suitable, for, the, relatively, thin, layers, of, ink, laid, out, on, the, surface, of, a, print, pigment, is, a, finely, ground, particulate, substance, which, when, mixed, or, ground, into, a, liquid, to, make, ink, or, paint, does, not, dissolve, but, remains, dispersed, or, suspended, in, the, liquid, pigments, are, categorized, as, either, inorganic, mineral, or, organic, synthetic, pigment, based, inks, have, a, much, longer, permanence, than, dye, based, inks, gicl, e, pron, i, kle, zhee, klay, or, d, i, kle, is, a, neologism, coined, in, 1991, by, printmaker, jack, duganne, for, digital, prints, made, on, inkjet, printers, originally, associated, with, early, dye, based, printers, it, is, now, more, often, refers, to, pigment, based, prints, the, word, is, based, on, the, french, word, gicleur, which, means, nozzle, today, fine, art, prints, produced, on, large, format, ink, jet, machines, using, the, ccmmyk, color, model, are, generally, called, gicl, e, in, art, foil, imaging, is, a, printmaking, technique, made, using, the, iowa, foil, printer, developed, by, virginia, a, myers, from, the, commercial, foil, stamping, process, this, uses, gold, leaf, and, acrylic, foil, in, the, printmaking, process, direct, to, garment, printing, dtg, is, a, process, of, printing, on, textiles, using, specialized, aqueous, ink, jet, technology, dtg, printers, typically, have, a, platen, designed, to, hold, the, garment, in, a, fixed, position, and, the, printer, inks, are, jetted, or, sprayed, onto, the, textile, by, the, print, head, printmakers, apply, color, to, their, prints, in, many, different, ways, some, coloring, techniques, include, positive, surface, roll, negative, surface, roll, and, a, la, poup, e, often, color, in, printmaking, that, involves, etching, screen, printing, woodcut, or, linocut, is, applied, by, either, using, separate, plates, blocks, or, screens, or, by, using, a, reductionist, approach, in, multiple, plate, color, techniques, a, number, of, plates, screens, or, blocks, are, produced, each, providing, a, different, color, each, separate, plate, screen, or, block, will, be, inked, up, in, a, different, color, and, applied, in, a, particular, sequence, to, produce, the, entire, picture, on, average, about, three, to, four, plates, are, produced, but, there, are, occasions, where, a, printmaker, may, use, up, to, seven, plates, every, application, of, another, plate, of, color, will, interact, with, the, color, already, applied, to, the, paper, and, this, must, be, kept, in, mind, when, producing, the, separation, of, colors, the, lightest, colors, are, often, applied, first, and, then, darker, colors, successively, until, the, darkest, the, reductionist, approach, to, producing, color, is, to, start, with, a, lino, or, wood, block, that, is, either, blank, or, with, a, simple, etching, upon, each, printing, of, color, the, printmaker, will, then, further, cut, into, the, lino, or, woodblock, removing, more, material, and, then, apply, another, color, and, reprint, each, successive, removal, of, lino, or, wood, from, the, block, will, expose, the, already, printed, color, to, the, viewer, of, the, print, picasso, is, often, cited, as, the, inventor, of, reduction, printmaking, although, there, is, evidence, of, this, method, in, use, 25, years, before, picasso, s, linocuts, the, subtractive, color, concept, is, also, used, in, offset, or, digital, print, and, is, present, in, bitmap, or, vectorial, software, in, cmyk, or, other, color, spaces, in, printmaking, processes, requiring, more, than, one, application, of, ink, or, other, medium, the, problem, exists, as, to, how, to, line, up, properly, areas, of, an, image, to, receive, ink, in, each, application, the, most, obvious, example, of, this, would, be, a, multi, color, image, in, which, each, color, is, applied, in, a, separate, step, the, lining, up, of, the, results, of, each, step, in, a, multistep, printmaking, process, is, called, registration, proper, registration, results, in, the, various, components, of, an, image, being, in, their, proper, place, but, for, artistic, reasons, improper, registration, is, not, necessarily, the, ruination, of, an, image, andy, warhol, was, known, to, intentionally, employ, improper, registration, this, can, vary, significantly, from, process, to, process, this, involves, the, matrices, of, different, colors, generally, three, or, four, being, printed, successively, on, the, paper, in, a, correct, alignment, to, provide, the, print, in, color, protective, clothing, is, very, important, for, printmakers, who, engage, in, etching, and, lithography, closed, toed, shoes, and, long, pants, whereas, in, the, past, printmakers, put, their, plates, in, and, out, of, acid, baths, with, their, bare, hands, today, printmakers, use, rubber, gloves, they, also, wear, industrial, respirators, for, protection, from, caustic, vapors, most, acid, baths, are, built, with, ventilation, hoods, above, them, protective, respirators, and, masks, should, have, particle, filters, particularly, for, aquatinting, as, a, part, of, the, aquatinting, process, a,
