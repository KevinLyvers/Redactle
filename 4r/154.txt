which, are, narrated, by, some, of, the, picaresque, figures, encountered, by, the, don, and, sancho, during, their, travels, the, longest, and, best, known, of, these, is, el, curioso, impertinente,

criticism, of, his, digressions, in, part, one, and, promises, to, concentrate, the, narrative, on, the, central, characters, although, at, one, point, he, laments, that, his, narrative, muse, has, been, constrained, in, this, manner, nevertheless, part, two, contains, several, back, narratives, related, by, peripheral, characters, several, abridged, editions, have, been, published, which, delete, some, or, all, of, the, extra, tales, in, order, to, concentrate, on, the, central, narrative, the, story, within, a, story, relates, that, for, no, particular, reason, anselmo, decides, to,

camilla, is, a, faithful, wife, anselmo, learns, that, lothario, has, lied, and, attempted, no, seduction, he, makes, lothario, promise, to, try, in, earnest, and, leaves, town, to, make, this, easier, lothario, tries, and, camilla, writes, letters, to, her, husband, telling, him, of, the, attempts, by, lothario, and, asking, him, to, return, anselmo, makes, no, reply, and, does, not, return, lothario, then, falls, in, love, with, camilla, who, eventually, reciprocates, an, affair, between, them, ensues, but, is, not, disclosed, to, anselmo, and, their, affair, continues, after,

successful, and, arranges, a, time, and, place, for, anselmo, to, see, the, seduction, before, this, rendezvous, however, lothario, learns, that, the, man, was, the, lover, of, camilla, s, maid, he, and, camilla, then, contrive, to, deceive, anselmo, further, when, anselmo, watches, them, she, refuses, lothario, protests, her, love, for, her, husband, and, stabs, herself, lightly, in, the,

write, the, story, but, dies, of, grief, before, he, can, finish, lothario, is, killed, in, battle, soon, afterward, and, camilla, dies, of, grief, the, novel, s, farcical, elements, make, use, of, punning, and, similar, verbal, playfulness, character, naming, in, don, quixote, makes, ample, figural, use, of, contradiction, inversion, and, irony, such, as, the, names, rocinante, a, reversal, and, dulcinea, an, allusion, to, illusion, and, the, word, quixote, itself, possibly, a, pun, on, quijada, jaw, but, certainly, cuixot, catalan, thighs, a, reference, to, a, horse, s, rump, as, a, military, term, the, word, quijote, refers, to, cuisses, part, of, a, full, suit, of, plate, armour, protecting, the, thighs, the, spanish, suffix, ote, denotes, the, augmentative, for, example, grande, means, large, but, grandote, means, extra, large, with, grotesque, connotations, following, this, example, quixote, would, suggest, the, great, quijano, an, oxymoronic, play, on, words, that, makes, much, sense, in, light, of, the, character, s, delusions, of, grandeur, cervantes, wrote, his, work, in, early, modern, spanish, heavily, borrowing, from, old, spanish, the, medieval, form, of, the, language, the, language, of, don, quixote, although, still, containing, archaisms, is, far, more, understandable, to, modern, spanish, readers, than, is, for, instance, the, completely, medieval, spanish, of, the, poema, de, mio, cid, a, kind, of, spanish, that, is, as, different, from, cervantes, language, as, middle, english, is, from, modern, english, the, old, castilian, language, was, also, used, to, show, the, higher, class, that, came, with, being, a, knight, errant, in, don, quixote, there, are, basically, two, different, types, of, castilian, old, castilian, is, spoken, only, by, don, quixote, while, the, rest, of, the, roles, speak, a, contemporary, late, 16th, century, version, of, spanish, the, old, castilian, of, don, quixote, is, a, humoristic, resource, he, copies, the, language, spoken, in, the, chivalric, books, that, made, him, mad, and, many, times, when, he, talks, nobody, is, able, to, understand, him, because, his, language, is, too, old, this, humorous, effect, is, more, difficult, to, see, nowadays, because, the, reader, must, be, able, to, distinguish, the, two, old, versions, of, the, language, but, when, the, book, was, published, it, was, much, celebrated, english, translations, can, get, some, sense, of, the, effect, by, having, don, quixote, use, king, james, bible, or, shakespearean, english, or, even, middle, english, in, old, castilian, the, letter, x, represented, the, sound, written, sh, in, modern, english, so, the, name, was, originally, pronounced, however, as, old, castilian, evolved, towards, modern, spanish, a, sound, change, caused, it, to, be, pronounced, with, a, voiceless, velar, fricative, sound, like, the, scots, or, german, ch, and, today, the, spanish, pronunciation, of, quixote, is, the, original, pronunciation, is, reflected, in, languages, such, as, asturian, leonese, galician, catalan, italian, portuguese, turkish, and, french, where, it, is, pronounced, with, a, sh, or, ch, sound, the, french, opera, don, quichotte, is, one, of, the, best, known, modern, examples, of, this, pronunciation, today, english, speakers, generally, attempt, something, close, to, the, modern, spanish, pronunciation, of, quixote, quijote, as, k, i, h, o, t, i, although, the, traditional, english, spelling, based, pronunciation, with, the, value, of, the, letter, x, in, modern, english, is, still, sometimes, used, resulting, in, k, w, k, s, t, or, k, w, k, s, o, t, in, australian, english, the, preferred, pronunciation, amongst, members, of, the, educated, classes, was, k, w, k, s, t, until, well, into, the, 1970s, as, part, of, a, tendency, for, the, upper, class, to, anglicise, its, borrowing, ruthlessly, the, traditional, english, rendering, is, preserved, in, the, pronunciation, of, the, adjectival, form, quixotic, i, e, k, w, k, s, t, k, defined, by, merriam, webster, as, the, foolishly, impractical, pursuit, of, ideals, typically, marked, by, rash, and, lofty, romanticism, harold, bloom, says, don, quixote, is, the, first, modern, novel, and, that, the, protagonist, is, at, war, with, freud, s, reality, principle, which, accepts, the, necessity, of, dying, bloom, says, that, the, novel, has, an, endless, range, of, meanings, but, that, a, recurring, theme, is, the, human, need, to, withstand, suffering, edith, grossman, who, wrote, and, published, a, highly, acclaimed, english, translation, of, the, novel, in, 2003, says, that, the, book, is, mostly, meant, to, move, people, into, emotion, using, a, systematic, change, of, course, on, the, verge, of, both, tragedy, and, comedy, at, the, same, time, grossman, has, stated, the, question, is, that, quixote, has, multiple, interpretations, and, how, do, i, deal, with, that, in, my, translation, i, m, going, to, answer, your, question, by, avoiding, it, so, when, i, first, started, reading, the, quixote, i, thought, it, was, the, most, tragic, book, in, the, world, and, i, would, read, it, and, weep, as, i, grew, older, my, skin, grew, thicker, and, so, when, i, was, working, on, the, translation, i, was, actually, sitting, at, my, computer, and, laughing, out, loud, this, is, done, as, cervantes, did, it, by, never, letting, the, reader, rest, you, are, never, certain, that, you, truly, got, it, because, as, soon, as, you, think, you, understand, something, cervantes, introduces, something, that, contradicts, your, premise, the, novel, s, structure, is, episodic, in, form, the, full, title, is, indicative, of, the, tale, s, object, as, ingenioso, spanish, means, quick, with, inventiveness, marking, the, transition, of, modern, literature, from, dramatic, to, thematic, unity, the, novel, takes, place, over, a, long, period, of, time, including, many, adventures, united, by, common, themes, of, the, nature, of, reality, reading, and, dialogue, in, general, although, burlesque, on, the, surface, the, novel, especially, in, its, second, half, has, served, as, an, important, thematic, source, not, only, in, literature, but, also, in, much, of, art, and, music, inspiring, works, by, pablo, picasso, and, richard, strauss, the, contrasts, between, the, tall, thin, fancy, struck, and, idealistic, quixote, and, the, fat, squat, world, weary, panza, is, a, motif, echoed, ever, since, the, book, s, publication, and, don, quixote, s, imaginings, are, the, butt, of, outrageous, and, cruel, practical, jokes, in, the, novel, even, faithful, and, simple, sancho, is, forced, to, deceive, him, at, certain, points, the, novel, is, considered, a, satire, of, orthodoxy, veracity, and, even, nationalism, in, exploring, the, individualism, of, his, characters, cervantes, helped, lead, literary, practice, beyond, the, narrow, convention, of, the, chivalric, romance, he, spoofs, the, chivalric, romance, through, a, straightforward, retelling, of, a, series, of, acts, that, redound, to, the, knightly, virtues, of, the, hero, the, character, of, don, quixote, became, so, well, known, in, its, time, that, the, word, quixotic, was, quickly, adopted, by, many, languages, characters, such, as, sancho, panza, and, don, quixote, s, steed, rocinante, are, emblems, of, western, literary, culture, the, phrase, tilting, at, windmills, to, describe, an, act, of, attacking, imaginary, enemies, or, an, act, of, extreme, idealism, derives, from, an, iconic, scene, in, the, book, it, stands, in, a, unique, position, between, medieval, romance, and, the, modern, novel, the, former, consists, of, disconnected, stories, featuring, the, same, characters, and, settings, with, little, exploration, of, the, inner, life, of, even, the, main, character, the, latter, are, usually, focused, on, the, psychological, evolution, of, their, characters, in, part, i, quixote, imposes, himself, on, his, environment, by, part, ii, people, know, about, him, through, having, read, his, adventures, and, so, he, needs, to, do, less, to, maintain, his, image, by, his, deathbed, he, has, regained, his, sanity, and, is, once, more, alonso, quixano, the, good, sources, for, don, quixote, include, the, castilian, novel, amadis, de, gaula, which, had, enjoyed, great, popularity, throughout, the, 16th, century, another, prominent, source, which, cervantes, evidently, admires, more, is, tirant, lo, blanch, which, the, priest, describes, in, chapter, vi, of, quixote, as, the, best, book, in, the, world, however, the, sense, in, which, it, was, best, is, much, debated, among, scholars, since, the, 19th, century, the, passage, has, been, called, the, most, difficult, passage, of, don, quixote, the, scene, of, the, book, burning, provides, a, list, of, cervantes, s, likes, and, dislikes, about, literature, cervantes, makes, a, number, of, references, to, the, italian, poem, orlando, furioso, in, chapter, 10, of, the, first, part, of, the, novel, don, quixote, says, he, must, take, the, magical, helmet, of, mambrino, an, episode, from, canto, i, of,

from, canto, 43, of, orlando, regarding, a, man, who, tests, the, fidelity, of, his, wife, another, important, source, appears, to, have, been, apuleius, s, the, golden, ass, one, of, the, earliest, known, novels, a, picaresque, from, late, classical, antiquity, the, wineskins, episode, near, the, end, of, the, interpolated, tale, the, curious, impertinent, in, chapter, 35, of, the, first, part, of, don, quixote, is, a, clear, reference, to, apuleius, and, recent, scholarship, suggests, that, the, moral, philosophy, and, the, basic, trajectory, of, apuleius, s, novel, are, fundamental, to, cervantes, program, similarly, many, of, both, sancho, s, adventures, in, part, ii, and, proverbs, throughout, are, taken, from, popular, spanish, and, italian, folklore, cervantes, experiences, as, a, galley, slave, in, algiers, also, influenced, quixote, medical, theories, may, have, also, influenced, cervantes, literary, process, cervantes, had, familial, ties, to, the, distinguished, medical, community, his, father, rodrigo, de, cervantes, and, his, great, grandfather, juan, d, az, de, torreblanca, were, surgeons, additionally, his, sister, andrea, de, cervantes, was, a, nurse, he, also, befriended, many, individuals, involved, in, the, medical, field, in, that, he, knew, medical, author, francisco, d, az, an, expert, in, urology, and, royal, doctor, antonio, ponce, de, santa, cruz, who, served, as, a, personal, doctor, to, both, philip, iii, and, philip, iv, of, spain, apart, from, the, personal, relations, cervantes, maintained, within, the, medical, field, cervantes, personal, life, was, defined, by, an, interest, in, medicine, he, frequently, visited, patients, from, the, hospital, de, inocentes, in, sevilla, furthermore, cervantes, explored, medicine, in, his, personal, library, his, library, contained, more, than, 200, volumes, and, included, books, like, examen, de, ingenios, by, juan, huarte, and, practica, y, te, rica, de, cirug, a, by, dionisio, daza, chac, n, that, defined, medical, literature, and, medical, theories, of, his, time, researchers, isabel, sanchez, duque, and, francisco, javier, escudero, have, found, that, cervantes, was, a, friend, of, the, family, villase, or, which, was, involved, in, a, combat, with, francisco, de, acu, a, both, sides, combated, disguised, as, medieval, knights, in, the, road, from, el, toboso, to, miguel, esteban, in, 1581, they, also, found, a, person, called, rodrigo, quijada, who, bought, the, title, of, nobility, of, hidalgo, and, created, diverse, conflicts, with, the, help, of, a, squire, it, is, not, certain, when, cervantes, began, writing, part, two, of, don, quixote, but, he, had, probably, not, proceeded, much, further, than, chapter, lix, by, late, july, 1614, in, about, september, however, a, spurious, part, two, entitled, second, volume, of, the, ingenious, gentleman, don, quixote, of, la, mancha, by, the, licenciado, doctorate, alonso, fern, ndez, de, avellaneda, of, tordesillas, was, published, in, tarragona, by, an, unidentified, aragonese, who, was, an, admirer, of, lope, de, vega, rival, of, cervantes, it, was, translated, into, english, by, william, augustus, yardley, esquire, in, two, volumes, in, 1784, some, modern, scholars, suggest, that, don, quixote, s, fictional, encounter, with, avellaneda, s, book, in, chapter, 59, of, part, ii, should, not, be, taken, as, the, date, that, cervantes, encountered, it, which, may, have, been, much, earlier, avellaneda, s, identity, has, been, the, subject, of, many, theories, but, there, is, no, consensus, as, to, who, he, was, in, its, prologue, the, author, gratuitously, insulted, cervantes, who, took, offense, and, responded, the, last, half, of, chapter, lix, and, most, of, the, following, chapters, of, cervantes, s, segunda, parte, lend, some, insight, into, the, effects, upon, him, cervantes, manages, to, work, in, some, subtle, digs, at, avellaneda, s, own, work, and, in, his, preface, to, part, ii, comes, very, near, to, criticizing, avellaneda, directly, in, his, introduction, to, the, portable, cervantes, samuel, putnam, a, noted, translator, of, cervantes, novel, calls, avellaneda, s, version, one, of, the, most, disgraceful, performances, in, history, the, second, part, of, cervantes, don, quixote, finished, as, a, direct, result, of, the, avellaneda, book, has, come, to, be, regarded, by, some, literary, critics, as, superior, to, the, first, part, because, of, its, greater, depth, of, characterization, its, discussions, mostly, between, quixote, and, sancho, on, diverse, subjects, and, its, philosophical, insights, in, cervantes, s, segunda, parte, don, quixote, visits, a, printing, house, in, barcelona, and, finds, avellaneda, s, second, part, being, printed, there, in, an, early, example, of, metafiction, don, quixote, and, sancho, panza, also, meet, one, of, the, characters, from, avellaneda, s, book, don, alvaro, tarfe, and, make, him, swear, that, the, other, quixote, and, sancho, are, impostors, cervantes, story, takes, place, on, the, plains, of, la, mancha, specifically, the, comarca, of, campo, de, montiel, en, un, lugar, de, la, mancha, de, cuyo, nombre, no, quiero, acordarme, no, ha, mucho, tiempo, que, viv, a, un, hidalgo, de, los, de, lanza, en, astillero, adarga, antigua, roc, n, flaco, y, galgo, corredor, somewhere, in, la, mancha, in, a, place, whose, name, i, do, not, care, to, remember, a, gentleman, lived, not, long, ago, one, of, those, who, has, a, lance, and, ancient, shield, on, a, shelf, and, keeps, a, skinny, nag, and, a, greyhound, for, racing, the, location, of, the, village, to, which, cervantes, alludes, in, the, opening, sentence, of, don, quixote, has, been, the, subject, of, debate, since, its, publication, over, four, centuries, ago, indeed, cervantes, deliberately, omits, the, name, of, the, village, giving, an, explanation, in, the, final, chapter, such, was, the, end, of, the, ingenious, gentleman, of, la, mancha, whose, village, cide, hamete, would, not, indicate, precisely, in, order, to, leave, all, the, towns, and, villages, of, la, mancha, to, contend, among, themselves, for, the, right, to, adopt, him, and, claim, him, as, a, son, as, the, seven, cities, of, greece, contended, for, homer, in, 2004, a, multidisciplinary, team, of, academics, from, complutense, university, led, by, francisco, parra, luna, manuel, fern, ndez, nieto, and, santiago, petschen, verdaguer, deduced, that, the, village, was, that, of, villanueva, de, los, infantes, their, findings, were, published, in, a, paper, titled, el, quijote, como, un, sistema, de, distancias, tiempos, hacia, la, localizaci, n, del, lugar, de, la, mancha, which, was, later, published, as, a, book, el, enigma, resuelto, del, quijote, the, result, was, replicated, in, two, subsequent, investigations, la, determinaci, n, del, lugar, de, la, mancha, como, problema, estad, stico, and, the, kinematics, of, the, quixote, and, the, identity, of, the, place, in, la, mancha, translators, of, don, quixote, such, as, john, ormsby, have, commented, that, the, region, of, la, mancha, is, one, of, the, most, desertlike, unremarkable, regions, of, spain, the, least, romantic, and, fanciful, place, that, one, would, imagine, as, the, home, of, a, courageous, knight, on, the, other, hand, as, borges, points, out, i, suspect, that, in, don, quixote, it, does, not, rain, a, single, time, the, landscapes, described, by, cervantes, have, nothing, in, common, with, the, landscapes, of, castile, they, are, conventional, landscapes, full, of, meadows, streams, and, copses, that, belong, in, an, italian, novel, the, story, also, takes, place, in, el, toboso, where, don, quixote, goes, to, seek, dulcinea, s, blessings, don, quixote, is, said, to, reflect, the, spanish, society, in, which, cervantes, lived, and, wrote, spain, s, status, as, a, world, power, was, declining, and, the, spanish, national, treasury, was, bankrupt, due, to, expensive, foreign, wars, spanish, cultural, dominance, was, also, waning, as, the, protestant, reformation, had, put, the, spanish, roman, catholic, church, on, the, defensive, which, had, led, to, the, establishment, of, the, spanish, inquisition, meanwhile, the, hidalgo, class, was, losing, relevance, because, of, changes, in, spanish, society, which, made, the, high, ideals, of, chivalry, obsolete, don, quixote, continues, to, be, the, origin, of, replication, for, authors, in, 2002, the, norwegian, nobel, institute, conducted, a, study, among, writers, from, 55, countries, the, majority, voted, don, quixote, the, greatest, work, of, fiction, ever, written, the, opening, sentence, of, the, book, created, a, classic, spanish, clich, with, the, phrase, de, cuyo, nombre, no, quiero, acordarme, whose, name, i, do, not, wish, to, recall, en, un, lugar, de, la, mancha, de, cuyo, nombre, no, quiero, acordarme, no, ha, mucho, tiempo, que, viv, a, un,

long, ago, one, of, those, gentlemen, with, a, lance, in, the, lance, rack, an, ancient, shield, a, skinny, old, horse, and, a, fast, greyhound, don, quixote, alongside, its, many, translations, has, also, provided, a, number, of, idioms, and, expressions, to, the, english, language, examples, with, their, own, articles, include, the, phrase, the, pot, calling, the, kettle, black, and, the, adjective, quixotic, tilting, at, windmills, is, an, english, idiom, that, means, attacking, imaginary, enemies, the, expression, is, derived, from, don, quixote, and, the, word, tilt, in, this, context, refers, to, jousting, this, phrase, is, sometimes, also, expressed, as, charging, at, windmills, or, fighting, the, windmills, the, phrase, is, sometimes, used, to, describe, either, confrontations, where, adversaries, are, incorrectly, perceived, or, courses, of, action, that, are, based, on, misinterpreted, or, misapplied, heroic, romantic, or, idealistic, justifications, it, may, also, connote, an, inopportune, unfounded, and, vain, effort, against, adversaries, real, or, imagined, in, july, 1604, cervantes, sold, the, rights, of, el, ingenioso, hidalgo, don, quixote, de,

cervantes, into, writing, and, publishing, a, genuine, second, part, in, 1615, which, was, a, year, before, his, own, death, don, quixote, had, been, growing, in, favour, and, its, author, s, name,

at, the, time, as, was, the, custom, of, envious, or, unscrupulous, writers, seven, years, after, the, parte, primera, appeared, don, quixote, had, been, translated, into, french, german, italian, and, english, with, the, first, french, translation, of, part, ii, appearing, in, 1618, and, the, first, english, translation, in, 1620, one, abridged, adaptation, authored, by, agust, n, s, nchez,

there, is, no, evidence, that, shelton, had, met, the, author, although, shelton, s, version, is, cherished, by, some, according, to, john, ormsby, and, samuel, putnam, it, was, far, from, satisfactory, as, a, carrying, over, of, cervantes, text, shelton, s, translation, of, the, novel, s, second, part, appeared, in, 1620, near, the, end, of, the, 17th, century, john, phillips, a, nephew, of, poet, john, milton, published, what, putnam, considered, the, worst, english, translation, the, translation, as, literary, critics, claim, was, not, based, on, cervantes, text, but, mostly, on, a, french, work, by, filleau, de, saint, martin, and, on, notes, which, thomas, shelton, had, written, around, 1700, a, version, by, pierre, antoine, motteux, appeared, motteux, s, translation, enjoyed, lasting, popularity, it, was, reprinted, as, the, modern, library, series, edition, of, the, novel, until, recent, times, nonetheless, future, translators, would, find, much, to, fault, in, motteux, s, version, samuel, putnam, criticized, the, prevailing, slapstick, quality, of, this, work, especially, where, sancho, panza, is, involved, the, obtrusion, of, the, obscene, where, it, is, found, in, the, original, and, the, slurring, of, difficulties, through, omissions, or, expanding, upon, the, text, john, ormsby, considered, motteux, s, version, worse, than, worthless, and, denounced, its, infusion, of, cockney, flippancy, and, facetiousness, into, the, original, the, proverb, the, proof, of, the, pudding, is, in, the, eating, is, widely, attributed, to, cervantes, the, spanish, word, for, pudding, bud, n, however, does, not, appear, in, the, original, text, but, premieres, in, the, motteux, translation, in, smollett, s, translation, of, 1755, he, notes, that, the, original, text, reads, literally, you, will, see, when, the, eggs, are, fried, meaning, time, will, tell, a, translation, by, captain, john, stevens, which, revised, thomas, shelton, s, version, also, appeared, in, 1700, but, its, publication, was, overshadowed, by, the, simultaneous, release, of, motteux, s, translation, in, 1742, the, charles, jervas, translation, appeared, posthumously, through, a, printer, s, error, it, came, to, be, known, and, is, still, known, as, the, jarvis, translation, it, was, the, most, scholarly, and, accurate, english, translation, of, the, novel, up, to, that, time, but, future, translator, john, ormsby, points, out, in, his, own, introduction, to, the, novel, that, the, jarvis, translation, has, been, criticized, as, being, too, stiff, nevertheless, it, became, the, most, frequently, reprinted, translation, of, the, novel, until, about, 1885, another, 18th, century, translation, into, english, was, that, of, tobias, smollett, himself, a, novelist, first, published, in, 1755, like, the, jarvis, translation, it, continues, to, be, reprinted, today, a, translation, by, alexander, james, duffield, appeared, in, 1881, and, another, by, henry, edward, watts, in, 1888, most, modern, translators, take, as, their, model, the, 1885, translation, by, john, ormsby, an, expurgated, children, s, version, under, the, title, the, story, of, don, quixote, was, published, in, 1922, available, on, project, gutenberg, it, leaves, out, the, risqu, sections, as, well, as, chapters, that, young, readers, might, consider, dull, and, embellishes, a, great, deal, on, cervantes, original, text, the, title, page, actually, gives, credit, to, the, two, editors, as, if, they, were, the, authors, and, omits, any, mention, of, cervantes, the, most, widely, read, english, language, translations, of, the, mid, 20th, century, are, by, samuel, putnam, 1949, j, m, cohen, 1950, penguin, classics, and, walter, starkie, 1957, the, last,

literary, achievement, and, another, called, it, the, most, transparent, and, least, impeded, among, more, than, a, dozen, english, translations, going, back, to, the, 17th, century, in, 2005, the,

the, sense, of, the, original, as, closely, as, possible, though, not, at, the, expense, of, cervantes, literary, style, in, 2011, another, translation, by, gerald, j, davis, appeared, it, is, the, latest, and, the, fifth, translation, of, the, 21st, century, though, it, is, self, published, via, lulu, com, reviewing, 26, out, of, the, current, 28, english, translations, as, a, whole, in, 2006, daniel, eisenberg, stated, that, there, is, no, one, translation, ideal, for, every, purpose, but, expressed, a, preference, for, those, of, putnam, and, the, revision, of, ormsby, s, translation, by,
