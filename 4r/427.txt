has, often, been, considered, one, of, the, best, r, b, songs, of, its, era, earning, franklin, two, grammy, awards, in, 1968, for, best, rhythm, blues, recording, and, best, rhythm, blues, solo,

recording, registry, it, was, placed, number, five, on, the, 2004, version, of, rolling, stone, magazine, s, list, of, the, 500, greatest, songs, of, all, time, and, number, one, on, the, 2021, version, of, the, list, it, was, also, included, in, the, list, of, songs, of, the, century, by, the, recording, industry, of, america, and, the, national, endowment, for, the, arts, at, first, a, ballad, respect, was, brought, to, redding, by, earl, speedo, sims, who, intended, to, record, it, with, his, band, the, singing, demons, no, one, is, really, sure, who, wrote, the, original, version, of, the, song, bandleader, percy, welch, said, it, was, a, guitarist, at, bobby, smith, s, recording, studio, in, macon, redding, took, sims, version, rewrote, the, lyrics, and, sped, up, the, tempo, sims, went, with, the, band, to, the, muscle, shoals, studios, but, was, unable, to, produce, a, good, version, redding, then, decided, to, sing, the, song, himself, which, sims, agreed, to, redding, also, promised, to, credit, sims, but, this, never, happened, sims, never, pressed, redding, on, the, issue, possibly, because, he, himself, had, not, really, written, it, in, the, first, place, the, original, version, of, respect, was, produced, by, steve, cropper, who, also, played, instrumentals, for, the, hit, track, along, with, william, bell, and, earl, sims, on, backup, vocals, according, to, redding, biographer, jonathan, gould, the, lyrics, to, respect, paint, a, starkly, unromantic, picture, of, domestic, relations, revolving, around, a, little, girl, who, is, sweeter, than, honey, and, a, man, who, will, reward, her, with, all, money, this, relationship, dynamic, is, underscored, musically, by, a, near, comically, persistent, groove, and, celebratory, blaring, of, the, horns, which, seem, to, be, heralding, a, carnal, reunion, of, epic, proportions, redding, s, vocals, are, similarly, aggressive, marked, by, phrasing, in, staccato, bursts, in, delivering, the, verses, what, you, want, honey, you, got, it, you, can, do, me, wrong, honey, while, i, m, gone, all, i, m, asking, is, for, a, little, respect, when, i, come, home, accompanied, by, backing, male, vocals, in, the, manner, of, a, greek, chorus, adding, the, refrain, hey, hey, hey, in, gould, s, analysis, there, is, an, apparent, modesty, of, expectations, the, way, it, takes, a, word, that, commonly, refers, to, personal, esteem, and, scales, it, down, to, serve, as, a, euphemism, for, sexual, reward, referring, to, the, street, meaning, of, respect, bound, up, with, issues, of, deference, and, power, but, only, up, to, a, point, as, gould, concludes, of, the, song, s, finale, in, the, coda, that, follows, the, final, verse, otis, goes, to, work, wresting, the, word, free, of, this, narrow, meaning, asserting, his, prerogative, with, an, insistent, determination, that, turns, the, song, in, its, final, moments, into, a, plea, for, simple, human, dignity, respect, is, what, i, want, respect, is, what, i, need, i, got, ta, got, ta, have, it, just, give, me, some, respect, that, doesn, t, stop, at, mere, discretion, according, to, franklin, biographer, matt, dobkin, redding, s, version, is, characteristically, funky, with, his, raspy, soulful, singing, and, electric, vocal, charisma, front, and, center, utilizing, playful, horns, and, sexy, mock, beleaguered, vocals, according, to, npr, redding, s, version, reinforced, the, traditional, family, structure, of, the, time, man, works, all, day, brings, money, home, to, wife, and, demands, her, respect, in, return, the, song, was, included, on, redding, s, third, studio, album, otis, blue, 1965, the, album, became, widely, successful, even, outside, of, his, largely, r, b, and, blues, fan, base, when, released,
