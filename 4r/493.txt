abstract, expressionism, in, the, united, states, emerged, as, a, distinct, art, movement, in, the, immediate, aftermath, of, world, war, ii, and, gained, mainstream, acceptance, in, the, 1950s, a, shift, from, the, american, social, realism, of, the, 1930s, influenced, by, the, great, depression, and, mexican, muralists, the, term, was, first, applied, to, american, art, in, 1946, by, the, art, critic, robert, coates, key, figures, in, the, new, york, school, which, was, the, center, of, this, movement, included, such, artists, as, arshile, gorky, jackson, pollock, franz, kline, mark, rothko, norman, lewis, willem, de, kooning, adolph, gottlieb, clyfford, still, robert, motherwell, and, theodoros, stamos, among, others, the, movement, was, not, limited, to, painting, but, included, influential, collagists, and, sculptors, such, as, david, smith, louise, nevelson, and, others, abstract, expressionism, was, notably, influenced, by, the, spontaneous, and, subconscious, creation, methods, of, surrealist, artists, like, andr, masson, and, max, ernst, artists, associated, with, the, movement, combined, the, emotional, intensity, of, german, expressionism, with, the, radical, visual, vocabularies, of, european, avant, garde, schools, like, futurism, the, bauhaus, and, synthetic, cubism, abstract, expressionism, was, seen, as, rebellious, and, idiosyncratic, encompassing, various, artistic, styles, and, was, the, first, specifically, american, movement, to, achieve, international, influence, and, put, new, york, city, at, the, center, of, the, western, art, world, a, role, formerly, filled, by, paris, contemporary, art, critics, played, a, significant, role, in, its, development, critics, like, clement, greenberg, and, harold, rosenberg, promoted, the, work, of, artists, associated, with, abstract, expressionism, in, particular, jackson, pollock, through, their, writings, rosenberg, s, concept, of, the, canvas, as, an, arena, in, which, to, act, was, pivotal, in, defining, the, approach, of, action, painters, the, cultural, reign, of, abstract, expressionism, in, the, united, states, had, diminished, by, the, early, 1960s, while, the, subsequent, rejection, of, the, abstract, expressionist, emphasis, on, individualism, led, to, the, development, of, such, movements, as, pop, art, and, minimalism, throughout, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, influence, of, abex, can, be, seen, in, diverse, movements, in, the, u, s, and, europe, including, tachisme, and, neo, expressionism, among, others, the, term, abstract, expressionism, is, believed, to, have, first, been, used, in, germany, in, 1919, in, the, magazine, der, sturm, in, reference, to, german, expressionism, alfred, barr, used, this, term, in, 1929, to, describe, works, by, wassily, kandinsky, technically, an, important, predecessor, is, surrealism, with, its, emphasis, on, spontaneous, automatic, or, subconscious, creation, jackson, pollock, s, dripping, paint, onto, a, canvas, laid, on, the, floor, is, a, technique, that, has, its, roots, in, the, work, of, andr, masson, max, ernst, and, david, alfaro, siqueiros, the, newer, research, tends, to, put, the, exile, surrealist, wolfgang, paalen, in, the, position, of, the, artist, and, theoretician, who, fostered, the, theory, of, the, viewer, dependent, possibility, space, through, his, paintings, and, his, magazine, dyn, paalen, considered, ideas, of, quantum, mechanics, as, well, as, idiosyncratic, interpretations, of, the, totemic, vision, and, the, spatial, structure, of, native, indian, painting, from, british, columbia, and, prepared, the, ground, for, the, new, spatial, vision, of, the, young, american, abstracts, his, long, essay, totem, art, 1943, had, considerable, influence, on, such, artists, as, martha, graham, isamu, noguchi, pollock, mark, rothko, and, barnett, newman, around, 1944, barnett, newman, tried, to, explain, america, s, newest, art, movement, and, included, a, list, of, the, men, in, the, new, movement, paalen, is, mentioned, twice, other, artists, mentioned, are, gottlieb, rothko, pollock, hofmann, baziotes, gorky, and, others, robert, motherwell, is, mentioned, with, a, question, mark, another, important, early, manifestation, of, what, came, to, be, abstract, expressionism, is, the, work, of, american, northwest, artist, mark, tobey, especially, his, white, writing, canvases, which, though, generally, not, large, in, scale, anticipate, the, all, over, look, of, pollock, s, drip, paintings, the, movement, s, name, is, derived, from, the, combination, of, the, emotional, intensity, and, self, denial, of, the, german, expressionists, with, the, anti, figurative, aesthetic, of, the, european, abstract, schools, such, as, futurism, the, bauhaus, and, synthetic, cubism, additionally, it, has, an, image, of, being, rebellious, anarchic, highly, idiosyncratic, and, some, feel, nihilistic, in, practice, the, term, is, applied, to, any, number, of, artists, working, mostly, in, new, york, who, had, quite, different, styles, and, even, to, work, that, is, neither, especially, abstract, nor, expressionist, california, abstract, expressionist, jay, meuser, who, typically, painted, in, the, non, objective, style, wrote, about, his, painting, mare, nostrum, it, is, far, better, to, capture, the, glorious, spirit, of, the, sea, than, to, paint, all, of, its, tiny, ripples, pollock, s, energetic, action, paintings, with, their, busy, feel, are, different, both, technically, and, aesthetically, from, the, violent, and, grotesque, women, series, of, willem, de, kooning, s, figurative, paintings, and, the, rectangles, of, color, in, rothko, s, color, field, paintings, which, are, not, what, would, usually, be, called, expressionist, and, which, rothko, denied, were, abstract, yet, all, four, artists, are, classified, as, abstract, expressionists, abstract, expressionism, has, many, stylistic, similarities, to, the, russian, artists, of, the, early, 20th, century, such, as, wassily, kandinsky, although, it, is, true, that, spontaneity, or, the, impression, of, spontaneity, characterized, many, of, the, abstract, expressionists, works, most, of, these, paintings, involved, careful, planning, especially, since, their, large, size, demanded, it, with, artists, such, as, paul, klee, kandinsky, emma, kunz, and, later, on, rothko, newman, and, agnes, martin, abstract, art, clearly, implied, expression, of, ideas, concerning, the, spiritual, the, unconscious, and, the, mind, why, this, style, gained, mainstream, acceptance, in, the, 1950s, is, a, matter, of, debate, american, social, realism, had, been, the, mainstream, in, the, 1930s, it, had, been, influenced, not, only, by, the, great, depression, but, also, by, the, mexican, muralists, such, as, david, alfaro, siqueiros, and, diego, rivera, the, political, climate, after, world, war, ii, did, not, long, tolerate, the, social, protests, of, these, painters, abstract, expressionism, arose, during, the, war, and, began, to, be, showcased, during, the, early, forties, at, galleries, in, new, york, such, as, the, art, of, this, century, gallery, the, post, war, mccarthy, era, was, a, time, of, artistic, censorship, in, the, united, states, but, if, the, subject, matter, were, totally, abstract, then, it, would, be, seen, as, apolitical, and, therefore, safe, or, if, the, art, was, political, the, message, was, largely, for, the, insiders, while, the, movement, is, closely, associated, with, painting, collagist, anne, ryan, and, certain, sculptors, in, particular, were, also, integral, to, abstract, expressionism, david, smith, and, his, wife, dorothy, dehner, herbert, ferber, isamu, noguchi, ibram, lassaw, theodore, roszak, phillip, pavia, mary, callery, richard, stankiewicz, louise, bourgeois, and, louise, nevelson, in, particular, were, some, of, the, sculptors, considered, as, being, important, members, of, the, movement, in, addition, the, artists, david, hare, john, chamberlain, james, rosati, mark, di, suvero, and, sculptors, richard, lippold, raoul, hague, george, rickey, reuben, nakian, and, even, tony, smith, seymour, lipton, joseph, cornell, and, several, others, were, integral, parts, of, the, abstract, expressionist, movement, many, of, the, sculptors, listed, participated, in, the, ninth, street, show, a, famous, exhibition, curated, by, leo, castelli, on, east, ninth, street, in, new, york, city, in, 1951, besides, the, painters, and, sculptors, of, the, period, the, new, york, school, of, abstract, expressionism, also, generated, a, number, of, supportive, poets, including, frank, o, hara, and, photographers, such, as, aaron, siskind, and, fred, mcdarrah, whose, book, the, artist, s, world, in, pictures, documented, the, new, york, school, during, the, 1950s, and, filmmakers, notably, robert, frank, as, well, although, the, abstract, expressionist, school, spread, quickly, throughout, the, united, states, the, epicenters, of, this, style, were, new, york, city, and, the, san, francisco, bay, area, of, california, at, a, certain, moment, the, canvas, began, to, appear, to, one, american, painter, after, another, as, an, arena, in, which, to, act, what, was, to, go, on, the, canvas, was, not, a, picture, but, an, event, in, the, 1940s, there, were, not, only, few, galleries, the, art, of, this, century, pierre, matisse, gallery, julien, levy, gallery, and, a, few, others, but, also, few, critics, who, were, willing, to, follow, the, work, of, the, new, york, vanguard, there, were, also, a, few, artists, with, a, literary, background, among, them, robert, motherwell, and, barnett, newman, who, functioned, as, critics, as, well, while, the, new, york, avant, garde, was, still, relatively, unknown, by, the, late, 1940s, most, of, the, artists, who, have, become, household, names, today, had, their, well, established, patron, critics, clement, greenberg, advocated, jackson, pollock, and, the, color, field, painters, like, clyfford, still, mark, rothko, barnett, newman, adolph, gottlieb, and, hans, hofmann, harold, rosenberg, seemed, to, prefer, the, action, painters, such, as, willem, de, kooning, and, franz, kline, as, well, as, the, seminal, paintings, of, arshile, gorky, thomas, b, hess, the, managing, editor, of, artnews, championed, willem, de, kooning, the, new, critics, elevated, their, prot, g, s, by, casting, other, artists, as, followers, or, ignoring, those, who, did, not, serve, their, promotional, goal, in, 1958, mark, tobey, became, the, first, american, painter, since, whistler, 1895, to, win, top, prize, at, the, venice, biennale, barnett, newman, a, late, member, of, the, uptown, group, wrote, catalogue, forewords, and, reviews, and, by, the, late, 1940s, became, an, exhibiting, artist, at, betty, parsons, gallery, his, first, solo, show, was, in, 1948, soon, after, his, first, exhibition, barnett, newman, remarked, in, one, of, the, artists, sessions, at, studio, 35, we, are, in, the, process, of, making, the, world, to, a, certain, extent, in, our, own, image, utilizing, his, writing, skills, newman, fought, every, step, of, the, way, to, reinforce, his, newly, established, image, as, an, artist, and, to, promote, his, work, an, example, is, his, letter, on, april, 9, 1955, letter, to, sidney, janis, it, is, true, that, rothko, talks, the, fighter, he, fights, however, to, submit, to, the, philistine, world, my, struggle, against, bourgeois, society, has, involved, the, total, rejection, of, it, strangely, the, person, thought, to, have, had, most, to, do, with, the, promotion, of, this, style, was, a, new, york, trotskyist, clement, greenberg, as, long, time, art, critic, for, the, partisan, review, and, the, nation, he, became, an, early, and, literate, proponent, of, abstract, expressionism, the, well, heeled, artist, robert, motherwell, joined, greenberg, in, promoting, a, style, that, fit, the, political, climate, and, the, intellectual, rebelliousness, of, the, era, greenberg, proclaimed, abstract, expressionism, and, pollock, in, particular, as, the, epitome, of, aesthetic, value, he, supported, pollock, s, work, on, formalistic, grounds, as, simply, the, best, painting, of, its, day, and, the, culmination, of, an, art, tradition, going, back, via, cubism, and, c, zanne, to, monet, in, which, painting, became, ever, purer, and, more, concentrated, in, what, was, essential, to, it, the, making, of, marks, on, a, flat, surface, pollock, s, work, has, always, polarised, critics, rosenberg, spoke, of, the, transformation, of, painting, into, an, existential, drama, in, pollock, s, work, in, which, what, was, to, go, on, the, canvas, was, not, a, picture, but, an, event, the, big, moment, came, when, it, was, decided, to, paint, just, to, paint, the, gesture, on, the, canvas, was, a, gesture, of, liberation, from, value, political, aesthetic, moral, one, of, the, most, vocal, critics, of, abstract, expressionism, at, the, time, was, the, new, york, times, art, critic, john, canaday, meyer, schapiro, and, leo, steinberg, along, with, greenberg, and, rosenberg, were, important, art, historians, of, the, post, war, era, who, voiced, support, for, abstract, expressionism, during, the, early, to, mid, sixties, younger, art, critics, michael, fried, rosalind, krauss, and, robert, hughes, added, considerable, insights, into, the, critical, dialectic, that, continues, to, grow, around, abstract, expressionism, during, the, period, leading, up, to, and, during, world, war, ii, modernist, artists, writers, and, poets, as, well, as, important, collectors, and, dealers, fled, europe, and, the, onslaught, of, the, nazis, for, safe, haven, in, the, united, states, many, of, those, who, didn, t, flee, perished, among, the, artists, and, collectors, who, arrived, in, new, york, during, the, war, some, with, help, from, varian, fry, were, hans, namuth, yves, tanguy, kay, sage, max, ernst, jimmy, ernst, peggy, guggenheim, leo, castelli, marcel, duchamp, andr, masson, roberto, matta, andr, breton, marc, chagall, jacques, lipchitz, fernand, l, ger, and, piet, mondrian, a, few, artists, notably, picasso, matisse, and, pierre, bonnard, remained, in, france, and, survived, the, post, war, period, left, the, capitals, of, europe, in, upheaval, with, an, urgency, to, economically, and, physically, rebuild, and, to, politically, regroup, in, paris, formerly, the, center, of, european, culture, and, capital, of, the, art, world, the, climate, for, art, was, a, disaster, and, new, york, replaced, paris, as, the, new, center, of, the, art, world, post, war, europe, saw, the, continuation, of, surrealism, cubism, dada, and, the, works, of, matisse, also, in, europe, art, brut, and, lyrical, abstraction, or, tachisme, the, european, equivalent, to, abstract, expressionism, took, hold, of, the, newest, generation, serge, poliakoff, nicolas, de, sta, l, georges, mathieu, vieira, da, silva, jean, dubuffet, yves, klein, pierre, soulages, and, jean, messagier, among, others, are, considered, important, figures, in, post, war, european, painting, in, the, united, states, a, new, generation, of, american, artists, began, to, emerge, and, to, dominate, the, world, stage, and, they, were, called, abstract, expressionists, the, 1940s, in, new, york, city, heralded, the, triumph, of, american, abstract, expressionism, a, modernist, movement, that, combined, lessons, learned, from, matisse, picasso, surrealism, mir, cubism, fauvism, and, early, modernism, via, eminent, educators, in, the, united, states, including, hans, hofmann, from, germany, and, john, d, graham, from, ukraine, graham, s, influence, on, american, art, during, the, early, 1940s, was, particularly, visible, in, the, work, of, gorky, de, kooning, pollock, and, richard, pousette, dart, among, others, gorky, s, contributions, to, american, and, world, art, are, difficult, to, overestimate, his, work, as, lyrical, abstraction, was, a, new, language, he, lit, the, way, for, two, generations, of, american, artists, the, painterly, spontaneity, of, mature, works, such, as, the, liver, is, the, cock, s, comb, the, betrothal, ii, and, one, year, the, milkweed, immediately, prefigured, abstract, expressionism, and, leaders, in, the, new, york, school, have, acknowledged, gorky, s, considerable, influence, the, early, work, of, hyman, bloom, was, also, influential, american, artists, also, benefited, from, the, presence, of, piet, mondrian, fernand, l, ger, max, ernst, and, the, andr, breton, group, pierre, matisse, s, gallery, and, peggy, guggenheim, s, gallery, the, art, of, this, century, as, well, as, other, factors, hans, hofmann, in, particular, as, teacher, mentor, and, artist, was, both, important, and, influential, to, the, development, and, success, of, abstract, expressionism, in, the, united, states, among, hofmann, s, prot, g, s, was, clement, greenberg, who, became, an, enormously, influential, voice, for, american, painting, and, among, his, students, was, lee, krasner, who, introduced, her, teacher, hofmann, to, her, husband, jackson, pollock, during, the, late, 1940s, jackson, pollock, s, radical, approach, to, painting, revolutionized, the, potential, for, all, contemporary, art, that, followed, him, to, some, extent, pollock, realized, that, the, journey, toward, making, a, work, of, art, was, as, important, as, the, work, of, art, itself, like, picasso, s, innovative, reinventions, of, painting, and, sculpture, near, the, turn, of, the, century, via, cubism, and, constructed, sculpture, with, influences, as, disparate, as, navajo, sand, paintings, surrealism, jungian, analysis, and, mexican, mural, art, pollock, redefined, what, it, was, to, produce, art, his, move, away, from, easel, painting, and, conventionality, was, a, liberating, signal, to, the, artists, of, his, era, and, to, all, that, came, after, artists, realized, that, jackson, pollock, s, process, the, placing, of, unstretched, raw, canvas, on, the, floor, where, it, could, be, attacked, from, all, four, sides, using, artist, materials, and, industrial, materials, linear, skeins, of, paint, dripped, and, thrown, drawing, staining, brushing, imagery, and, non, imagery, essentially, took, art, making, beyond, any, prior, boundary, abstract, expressionism, in, general, expanded, and, developed, the, definitions, and, possibilities, that, artists, had, available, for, the, creation, of, new, works, of, art, the, other, abstract, expressionists, followed, pollock, s, breakthrough, with, new, breakthroughs, of, their, own, in, a, sense, the, innovations, of, pollock, de, kooning, franz, kline, rothko, philip, guston, hans, hofmann, clyfford, still, barnett, newman, ad, reinhardt, richard, pousette, dart, robert, motherwell, peter, voulkos, and, others, opened, the, floodgates, to, the, diversity, and, scope, of, all, the, art, that, followed, them, the, radical, anti, formalist, movements, of, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, including, fluxus, neo, dada, conceptual, art, and, the, feminist, art, movement, can, be, traced, to, the, innovations, of, abstract, expressionism, rereadings, into, abstract, art, done, by, art, historians, such, as, linda, nochlin, griselda, pollock, and, catherine, de, zegher, critically, shows, however, that, pioneer, women, artists, who, have, produced, major, innovations, in, modern, art, had, been, ignored, by, the, official, accounts, of, its, history, but, finally, began, to, achieve, long, overdue, recognition, in, the, wake, of, the, abstract, expressionist, movement, of, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, abstract, expressionism, emerged, as, a, major, art, movement, in, new, york, city, during, the, 1950s, and, thereafter, several, leading, art, galleries, began, to, include, the, abstract, expressionists, in, exhibitions, and, as, regulars, in, their, rosters, some, of, those, prominent, uptown, galleries, included, the, charles, egan, gallery, the, sidney, janis, gallery, the, betty, parsons, gallery, the, kootz, gallery, the, tibor, de, nagy, gallery, the, stable, gallery, the, leo, castelli, gallery, as, well, as, others, and, several, downtown, galleries, known, at, the, time, as, the, tenth, street, galleries, exhibited, many, emerging, younger, artists, working, in, the, abstract, expressionist, vein, action, painting, was, a, style, widespread, from, the, 1940s, until, the, early, 1960s, and, is, closely, associated, with, abstract, expressionism, some, critics, have, used, the, terms, action, painting, and, abstract, expressionism, interchangeably, a, comparison, is, often, drawn, between, the, american, action, painting, and, the, french, tachisme, the, term, was, coined, by, the, american, critic, harold, rosenberg, in, 1952, and, signaled, a, major, shift, in, the, aesthetic, perspective, of, new, york, school, painters, and, critics, according, to, rosenberg, the, canvas, was, an, arena, in, which, to, act, while, abstract, expressionists, such, as, jackson, pollock, franz, kline, and, willem, de, kooning, had, long, been, outspoken, in, their, view, of, a, painting, as, an, arena, within, which, to, come, to, terms, with, the, act, of, creation, earlier, critics, sympathetic, to, their, cause, like, clement, greenberg, focused, on, their, works, objectness, to, greenberg, it, was, the, physicality, of, the, paintings, clotted, and, oil, caked, surfaces, that, was, the, key, to, understanding, them, as, documents, of, the, artists, existential, struggle, rosenberg, s, critique, shifted, the, emphasis, from, the, object, to, the, struggle, itself, with, the, finished, painting, being, only, the, physical, manifestation, a, kind, of, residue, of, the, actual, work, of, art, which, was, in, the, act, or, process, of, the, painting, s, creation, this, spontaneous, activity, was, the, action, of, the, painter, through, arm, and, wrist, movement, painterly, gestures, brushstrokes, thrown, paint, splashed, stained, scumbled, and, dripped, the, painter, would, sometimes, let, the, paint, drip, onto, the, canvas, while, rhythmically, dancing, or, even, standing, in, the, canvas, sometimes, letting, the, paint, fall, according, to, the, subconscious, mind, thus, letting, the, unconscious, part, of, the, psyche, assert, and, express, itself, all, this, however, is, difficult, to, explain, or, interpret, because, it, is, a, supposed, unconscious, manifestation, of, the, act, of, pure, creation, in, practice, the, term, abstract, expressionism, is, applied, to, any, number, of, artists, working, mostly, in, new, york, who, had, quite, different, styles, and, even, applied, to, work, which, is, not, especially, abstract, nor, expressionist, pollock, s, energetic, action, paintings, with, their, busy, feel, are, different, both, technically, and, aesthetically, to, de, kooning, s, violent, and, grotesque, women, series, woman, v, is, one, of, a, series, of, six, paintings, made, by, de, kooning, between, 1950, and, 1953, that, depict, a, three, quarter, length, female, figure, he, began, the, first, of, these, paintings, woman, i, in, june, 1950, repeatedly, changing, and, painting, out, the, image, until, january, or, february, 1952, when, the, painting, was, abandoned, unfinished, the, art, historian, meyer, schapiro, saw, the, painting, in, de, kooning, s, studio, soon, afterwards, and, encouraged, the, artist, to, persist, de, kooning, s, response, was, to, begin, three, other, paintings, on, the, same, theme, woman, ii, woman, iii, and, woman, iv, during, the, summer, of, 1952, spent, at, east, hampton, de, kooning, further, explored, the, theme, through, drawings, and, pastels, he, may, have, finished, work, on, woman, i, by, the, end, of, june, or, possibly, as, late, as, november, 1952, and, probably, the, other, three, women, pictures, were, concluded, at, much, the, same, time, the, woman, series, are, decidedly, figurative, paintings, another, important, artist, is, franz, kline, as, with, jackson, pollock, and, other, abstract, expressionists, kline, was, labelled, an, action, painter, because, of, his, seemingly, spontaneous, and, intense, style, focusing, less, or, not, at, all, on, figures, or, imagery, but, on, the, actual, brushstrokes, and, use, of, canvas, as, demonstrated, by, his, painting, number, 2, 1954, automatic, writing, was, an, important, vehicle, for, action, painters, such, as, kline, in, his, black, and, white, paintings, pollock, mark, tobey, and, cy, twombly, who, used, gesture, surface, and, line, to, create, calligraphic, linear, symbols, and, skeins, that, resemble, language, and, resonate, as, powerful, manifestations, from, the, collective, unconscious, robert, motherwell, in, his, elegy, to, the, spanish, republic, series, painted, powerful, black, and, white, paintings, using, gesture, surface, and, symbol, evoking, powerful, emotional, charges, meanwhile, other, action, painters, notably, de, kooning, gorky, norman, bluhm, joan, mitchell, and, james, brooks, used, imagery, via, either, abstract, landscape, or, as, expressionistic, visions, of, the, figure, to, articulate, their, highly, personal, and, powerful, evocations, james, brooks, paintings, were, particularly, poetic, and, highly, prescient, in, relationship, to, lyrical, abstraction, that, became, prominent, in, the, late, 1960s, and, the, 1970s, clyfford, still, barnett, newman, adolph, gottlieb, and, the, serenely, shimmering, blocks, of, color, in, mark, rothko, s, work, which, is, not, what, would, usually, be, called, expressionist, and, which, rothko, denied, was, abstract, are, classified, as, abstract, expressionists, albeit, from, what, clement, greenberg, termed, the, color, field, direction, of, abstract, expressionism, both, hans, hofmann, and, robert, motherwell, can, be, comfortably, described, as, practitioners, of, action, painting, and, color, field, painting, in, the, 1940s, richard, pousette, dart, s, tightly, constructed, imagery, often, depended, upon, themes, of, mythology, and, mysticism, as, did, the, paintings, of, gottlieb, and, pollock, in, that, decade, as, well, color, field, painting, initially, referred, to, a, particular, type, of, abstract, expressionism, especially, the, work, of, rothko, still, newman, motherwell, gottlieb, ad, reinhardt, and, several, series, of, paintings, by, joan, mir, greenberg, perceived, color, field, painting, as, related, to, but, different, from, action, painting, the, color, field, painters, sought, to, rid, their, art, of, superfluous, rhetoric, artists, like, motherwell, still, rothko, gottlieb, hans, hofmann, helen, frankenthaler, sam, francis, mark, tobey, and, especially, ad, reinhardt, and, barnett, newman, whose, masterpiece, vir, heroicus, sublimis, is, in, the, collection, of, moma, used, greatly, reduced, references, to, nature, and, they, painted, with, a, highly, articulated, and, psychological, use, of, color, in, general, these, artists, eliminated, recognizable, imagery, in, the, case, of, rothko, and, gottlieb, sometimes, using, symbols, and, signs, as, a, replacement, of, imagery, certain, artists, quoted, references, to, past, or, present, art, but, in, general, color, field, painting, presents, abstraction, as, an, end, in, itself, in, pursuing, this, direction, of, modern, art, artists, wanted, to, present, each, painting, as, one, unified, cohesive, monolithic, image, in, distinction, to, the, emotional, energy, and, gestural, surface, marks, of, abstract, expressionists, such, as, pollock, and, de, kooning, the, color, field, painters, initially, appeared, to, be, cool, and, austere, effacing, the, individual, mark, in, favor, of, large, flat, areas, of, color, which, these, artists, considered, to, be, the, essential, nature, of, visual, abstraction, along, with, the, actual, shape, of, the, canvas, which, later, in, the, 1960s, frank, stella, in, particular, achieved, in, unusual, ways, with, combinations, of, curved, and, straight, edges, however, color, field, painting, has, proven, to, be, both, sensual, and, deeply, expressive, albeit, in, a, different, way, from, gestural, abstract, expressionism, although, abstract, expressionism, spread, quickly, throughout, the, united, states, the, major, centers, of, this, style, were, new, york, city, and, california, especially, in, the, new, york, school, and, the, san, francisco, bay, area, abstract, expressionist, paintings, share, certain, characteristics, including, the, use, of, large, canvases, an, all, over, approach, in, which, the, whole, canvas, is, treated, with, equal, importance, as, opposed, to, the, center, being, of, more, interest, than, the, edges, the, canvas, as, the, arena, became, a, credo, of, action, painting, while, the, integrity, of, the, picture, plane, became, a, credo, of, the, color, field, painters, younger, artists, began, exhibiting, their, abstract, expressionist, related, paintings, during, the, 1950s, as, well, including, alfred, leslie, sam, francis, joan, mitchell, helen, frankenthaler, cy, twombly, milton, resnick, michael, goldberg, norman, bluhm, grace, hartigan, friedel, dzubas, and, robert, goodnough, among, others, although, pollock, is, closely, associated, with, action, painting, because, of, his, style, technique, and, his, painterly, touch, and, his, physical, application, of, paint, art, critics, have, likened, pollock, to, both, action, painting, and, color, field, painting, another, critical, view, advanced, by, greenberg, connects, pollock, s, allover, canvasses, to, the, large, scale, water, lilies, of, claude, monet, done, during, the, 1920s, art, critics, such, as, michael, fried, greenberg, and, others, have, observed, that, the, overall, feeling, in, pollock, s, most, famous, works, his, drip, paintings, read, as, vast, fields, of, built, up, linear, elements, they, note, that, these, works, often, read, as, vast, complexes, of, similarly, valued, paint, skeins, and, all, over, fields, of, color, and, drawing, and, are, related, to, the, mural, sized, monets, which, are, similarly, constructed, of, close, valued, brushed, and, scumbled, marks, that, also, read, as, fields, of, color, and, drawing, pollock, s, use, of, all, over, composition, lend, a, philosophical, and, a, physical, connection, to, the, way, the, color, field, painters, like, newman, rothko, and, still, construct, their, unbroken, and, in, still, s, case, broken, surfaces, in, several, paintings, that, pollock, painted, after, his, classic, drip, painting, period, of, 1947, 1950, he, used, the, technique, of, staining, fluid, oil, paint, and, house, paint, into, raw, canvas, during, 1951, he, produced, a, series, of, semi, figurative, black, stain, paintings, and, in, 1952, he, produced, stain, paintings, using, color, in, his, november, 1952, exhibition, at, the, sidney, janis, gallery, in, new, york, city, pollock, showed, number, 12, 1952, a, large, masterful, stain, painting, that, resembles, a, brightly, colored, stained, landscape, with, an, overlay, of, broadly, dripped, dark, paint, the, painting, was, acquired, from, the, exhibition, by, nelson, rockefeller, for, his, personal, collection, while, arshile, gorky, is, considered, to, be, one, of, the, founding, fathers, of, abstract, expressionism, and, a, surrealist, he, was, also, one, of, the, first, painters, of, the, new, york, school, who, used, the, technique, of, staining, gorky, created, broad, fields, of, vivid, open, unbroken, color, that, he, used, in, many, of, his, paintings, as, grounds, in, gorky, s, most, effective, and, accomplished, paintings, between, the, years, 1941, 1948, he, consistently, used, intense, stained, fields, of, color, often, letting, the, paint, run, and, drip, under, and, around, his, familiar, lexicon, of, organic, and, biomorphic, shapes, and, delicate, lines, another, abstract, expressionist, whose, works, in, the, 1940s, call, to, mind, the, stain, paintings, of, the, 1960s, and, the, 1970s, is, james, brooks, brooks, regularly, used, stain, as, a, technique, in, his, paintings, from, the, late, 1940s, brooks, began, diluting, his, oil, paint, in, order, to, have, fluid, colors, with, which, to, pour, and, drip, and, stain, into, the, mostly, raw, canvas, that, he, used, these, works, often, combined, calligraphy, and, abstract, shapes, during, the, final, three, decades, of, his, career, sam, francis, style, of, large, scale, bright, abstract, expressionism, was, closely, associated, with, color, field, painting, his, paintings, straddled, both, camps, within, the, abstract, expressionist, rubric, action, painting, and, color, field, painting, having, seen, pollock, s, 1951, paintings, of, thinned, black, oil, paint, stained, into, raw, canvas, frankenthaler, began, to, produce, stain, paintings, in, varied, oil, colors, on, raw, canvas, in, 1952, her, most, famous, painting, from, that, period, is, mountains, and, sea, she, is, one, of, the, originators, of, the, color, field, movement, that, emerged, in, the, late, 1950s, frankenthaler, also, studied, with, hans, hofmann, hofmann, s, paintings, are, a, symphony, of, color, as, seen, in, the, gate, 1959, 1960, he, was, renowned, not, only, as, an, artist, but, also, as, a, teacher, of, art, both, in, his, native, germany, and, later, in, the, us, hofmann, who, came, to, the, united, states, from, germany, in, the, early, 1930s, brought, with, him, the, legacy, of, modernism, as, a, young, artist, in, pre, first, world, war, paris, hofmann, worked, with, robert, delaunay, and, he, knew, firsthand, the, innovative, work, of, both, picasso, and, matisse, matisse, s, work, had, an, enormous, influence, on, him, and, on, his, understanding, of, the, expressive, language, of, color, and, the, potentiality, of, abstraction, hofmann, was, one, of, the, first, theorists, of, color, field, painting, and, his, theories, were, influential, to, artists, and, to, critics, particularly, to, clement, greenberg, as, well, as, to, others, during, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, in, 1953, morris, louis, and, kenneth, noland, were, both, profoundly, influenced, by, helen, frankenthaler, s, stain, paintings, after, visiting, her, studio, in, new, york, city, returning, to, washington, dc, they, began, to, produce, the, major, works, that, created, the, color, field, movement, in, the, late, 1950s, in, 1972, then, metropolitan, museum, of, art, curator, henry, geldzahler, said, clement, greenberg, included, the, work, of, both, morris, louis, and, kenneth, noland, in, a, show, that, he, did, at, the, kootz, gallery, in, the, early, 1950s, clem, was, the, first, to, see, their, potential, he, invited, them, up, to, new, york, in, 1953, i, think, it, was, to, helen, s, studio, to, see, a, painting, that, she, had, just, done, called, mountains, and, sea, a, very, very, beautiful, painting, which, was, in, a, sense, out, of, pollock, and, out, of, gorky, it, also, was, one, of, the, first, stain, pictures, one, of, the, first, large, field, pictures, in, which, the, stain, technique, was, used, perhaps, the, first, one, louis, and, noland, saw, the, picture, unrolled, on, the, floor, of, her, studio, and, went, back, to, washington, dc, and, worked, together, for, a, while, working, at, the, implications, of, this, kind, of, painting, in, abstract, painting, during, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, several, new, directions, like, the, hard, edge, painting, exemplified, by, john, mclaughlin, emerged, meanwhile, as, a, reaction, against, the, subjectivism, of, abstract, expressionism, other, forms, of, geometric, abstraction, began, to, appear, in, artist, studios, and, in, radical, avant, garde, circles, greenberg, became, the, voice, of, post, painterly, abstraction, by, curating, an, influential, exhibition, of, new, painting, that, toured, important, art, museums, throughout, the, united, states, in, 1964, color, field, painting, hard, edge, painting, and, lyrical, abstraction, emerged, as, radical, new, directions, since, the, mid, 1970s, it, has, been, argued, that, the, style, attracted, the, attention, in, the, early, 1950s, of, the, cia, who, saw, it, as, representative, of, the, us, as, a, haven, of, free, thought, and, free, markets, as, well, as, a, challenge, to, both, the, socialist, realist, styles, prevalent, in, communist, nations, and, the, dominance, of, the, european, art, markets, the, book, by, frances, stonor, saunders, the, cultural, cold, war, the, cia, and, the, world, of, arts, and, letters,

interview, i, think, it, was, the, most, important, division, that, the, agency, had, and, i, think, that, it, played, an, enormous, role, in, the, cold, war, against, this, revisionist, tradition, an, essay, by, michael, kimmelman, chief, art, critic, of, the, new, york, times, called, revisiting, the, revisionists, the, modern, its, critics, and, the, cold, war, asserts, that, much, of, that, information, concerning, what, was, happening, on, the, american, art, scene, during, the, 1940s, and, 50s, as, well, as, the, revisionists, interpretation, of, it, is, false, or, decontextualized, other, books, on, the, subject, include, art, in, the, cold, war, by, christine, lindey, which, also, describes, the, art, of, the, soviet, union, at, the, same, time, and, pollock, and, after,

automatistes, helped, introduce, a, related, style, of, abstract, impressionism, to, the, parisian, art, world, from, 1949, michel, tapi, s, groundbreaking, book, un, art, autre, 1952, was, also, enormously, influential, in, this, regard, tapi, was, also, a, curator, and, exhibition, organizer, who, promoted, the, works, of, pollock, and, hans, hofmann, in, europe, by, the, 1960s, the, movement, s, initial, effect, had, been, assimilated, yet, its, methods, and, proponents, remained, highly, influential, in, art, affecting, profoundly, the, work, of, many, artists, who, followed, abstract, expressionism, preceded, tachisme, color, field, painting, lyrical, abstraction, fluxus, pop, art, minimalism, postminimalism, neo, expressionism, and, the, other, movements, of, the, sixties, and, seventies, and, it, influenced, all, those, later, movements, that, evolved, movements, which, were, direct, responses, to, and, rebellions, against, abstract, expressionism, began, with, hard, edge, painting, frank, stella, robert, indiana, and, others, and, pop, artists, notably, andy, warhol, claes, oldenburg, and, roy, lichtenstein, who, achieved, prominence, in, the, us, accompanied, by, richard, hamilton, in, britain, robert, rauschenberg, and, jasper, johns, in, the, us, formed, a, bridge, between, abstract, expressionism, and, pop, art, minimalism, was, exemplified, by, artists, such, as, donald, judd, robert, mangold, and, agnes, martin, however, many, painters, such, as, jules, olitski, joan, mitchell, and, antoni, t, pies, continued, to, work, in, the, abstract, expressionist, style, for, many, years, extending, and, expanding, its, visual, and, philosophical, implications, as, many, abstract, artists, continue, to, do, today, in, styles, described, as, lyrical, abstraction, neo, expressionist, and, others, in, the, years, after, world, war, ii, a, group, of, new, york, artists, started, one, of, the, first, true, schools, of, artists, in, america, bringing, about, a, new, era, in, american, artwork, abstract, expressionism, this, led, to, the, american, art, boom, that, brought, about, styles, such, as, pop, art, this, also,
