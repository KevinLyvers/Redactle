simpler, terms, a, book, where, one, can, find, different, words, with, similar, meanings, to, other, words, sometimes, as, a, hierarchy, of, broader, and, narrower, terms, sometimes, simply, as, lists, of, synonyms, and, antonyms, they, are, often, used, by, writers, to, help, find, the, best, word, to, express, an, idea, to, find, the, word, or, words, by, which, idea, may, be, most, fitly, and, aptly, expressed, synonym, dictionaries, have, a, long, history, the, word, thesaurus, was, used, in, 1852, by, peter, mark, roget, for, his, roget, s, thesaurus, while, some, works, called, thesauri, such, as, roget, s, thesaurus, group, words, in, a, hierarchical, hypernymic, taxonomy, of, concepts, others, are, organised, alphabetically, or, in, some, other, way, most, thesauri, do, not, include, definitions, but, many, dictionaries, include, listings, of, synonyms, some, thesauri, and, dictionary, synonym, notes, characterise, the, distinctions, between, similar, words, with,
