the, ninety, five, theses, or, disputation, on, the, power, and, efficacy, of, indulgences, is, a, list, of, propositions, for, an, academic, disputation, written, in, 1517, by, martin, luther, then, a, professor, of, moral, theology, at, the, university, of, wittenberg, germany, the, theses, is, retrospectively, considered, to, have, launched, the, protestant, reformation, and, the, birth, of, protestantism, despite, various, proto, protestant, groups, having, existed, previously, it, detailed, luther, s, opposition, to, what, he, saw, as, the, roman, catholic, church, s, abuse, and, corruption, by, catholic, clergy, who, were, selling, plenary, indulgences, which, were, certificates, supposed, to, reduce, the, temporal, punishment, in, purgatory, for, sins, committed, by, the, purchasers, or, their, loved, ones, in, the, theses, luther, claimed, that, the, repentance, required, by, christ, in, order, for, sins, to, be, forgiven, involves, inner, spiritual, repentance, rather, than, merely, external, sacramental, confession, he, argued, that, indulgences, led, christians, to, avoid, true, repentance, and, sorrow, for, sin, believing, that, they, could, forgo, it, by, obtaining, an, indulgence, these, indulgences, according, to, luther, discouraged, christians, from, giving, to, the, poor, and, performing, other, acts, of, mercy, which, he, attributed, to, a, belief, that, indulgence, certificates, were, more, spiritually, valuable, though, luther, claimed, that, his, positions, on, indulgences, accorded, with, those, of, pope, leo, x, the, theses, challenge, a, 14th, century, papal, bull, stating, that, the, pope, could, use, the, treasury, of, merit, and, the, good, deeds, of, past, saints, to, forgive, temporal, punishment, for, sins, the, theses, are, framed, as, propositions, to, be, argued, in, debate, rather, than, necessarily, representing, luther, s, opinions, but, luther, later, clarified, his, views, in, the, explanations, of, the, disputation, concerning, the, value, of, indulgences, luther, sent, the, theses, enclosed, with, a, letter, to, albert, of, brandenburg, archbishop, of, mainz, on, 31, october, 1517, a, date, now, considered, the, start, of, the, reformation, and, commemorated, annually, as, reformation, day, luther, may, have, also, posted, the, ninety, five, theses, on, the, door, of, all, saints, church, and, other, churches, in, wittenberg, in, accordance, with, university, custom, at, some, point, between, 31, october, and, mid, november, the, theses, were, quickly, reprinted, and, translated, and, distributed, throughout, germany, and, europe, they, initiated, a, pamphlet, war, with, the, indulgence, preacher, johann, tetzel, which, spread, luther, s, fame, even, further, luther, s, ecclesiastical, superiors, had, him, tried, for, heresy, which, culminated, in, his, excommunication, in, 1521, though, the, theses, were, the, start, of, the, reformation, luther, did, not, consider, indulgences, to, be, as, important, as, other, theological, matters, which, would, divide, the, church, such, as, justification, by, faith, alone, and, the, bondage, of, the, will, his, breakthrough, on, these, issues, would, come, later, and, he, did, not, see, the, writing, of, the, theses, as, the, point, at, which, his, beliefs, diverged, from, those, of, the, roman, catholic, church, martin, luther, professor, of, moral, theology, at, the, university, of, wittenberg, and, town, preacher, wrote, the, ninety, five, theses, against, the, contemporary, practice, of, the, church, with, respect, to, indulgences, in, the, roman, catholic, church, which, was, practically, the, only, christian, church, in, western, europe, at, the, time, indulgences, were, part, of, the, economy, of, salvation, in, this, system, when, christians, sin, and, confess, they, are, forgiven, and, no, longer, stand, to, receive, eternal, punishment, in, hell, but, may, still, be, liable, to, temporal, punishment, this, punishment, could, be, satisfied, by, the, penitent, s, performing, works, of, mercy, if, the, temporal, punishment, is, not, satisfied, during, life, it, needs, to, be, satisfied, in, purgatory, a, place, believed, by, catholics, to, exist, between, heaven, and, hell, by, indulgence, which, may, be, understood, in, the, sense, of, kindness, this, temporal, punishment, could, be, lessened, under, abuses, of, the, system, of, indulgences, clergy, benefited, by, selling, indulgences, and, the, pope, gave, official, sanction, in, exchange, for, a, fee, popes, are, empowered, to, grant, plenary, indulgences, which, provide, complete, satisfaction, for, any, remaining, temporal, punishment, due, to, sins, and, these, were, purchased, on, behalf, of, people, believed, to, be, in, purgatory, this, led, to, the, popular, saying, as, soon, as, the, coin, in, the, coffer, rings, the, soul, from, purgatory, springs, theologians, at, the, university, of, paris, criticized, this, saying, late, in, the, 15th, century, earlier, critics, of, indulgences, included, john, wycliffe, who, denied, that, the, pope, had, jurisdiction, over, purgatory, jan, hus, and, his, followers, had, advocated, a, more, severe, system, of, penance, in, which, indulgences, were, not, available, johannes, von, wesel, had, also, attacked, indulgences, late, in, the, 15th, century, political, rulers, had, an, interest, in, controlling, indulgences, because, local, economies, suffered, when, the, money, for, indulgences, left, a, given, territory, rulers, often, sought, to, receive, a, portion, of, the, proceeds, or, prohibited, indulgences, altogether, as, duke, george, did, in, luther, s, electoral, saxony, in, 1515, pope, leo, x, granted, a, plenary, indulgence, intended, to, finance, the, construction, of, st, peter, s, basilica, in, roma, it, would, apply, to, almost, any, sin, including, adultery, and, theft, all, other, indulgence, preaching, was, to, cease, for, the, eight, years, in, which, it, was, offered, indulgence, preachers, were, given, strict, instructions, on, how, the, indulgence, was, to, be, preached, and, they, were, much, more, laudatory, of, the, indulgence, than, those, of, earlier, indulgences, johann, tetzel, was, commissioned, to, preach, and, offer, the, indulgence, in, 1517, and, his, campaign, in, cities, near, wittenberg, drew, many, wittenbergers, to, travel, to, these, cities, and, purchase, them, since, sales, had, been, prohibited, in, wittenberg, and, other, saxon, cities, luther, also, had, a, rather, negative, experience, and, idea, with, the, indulgences, connected, to, all, saints, church, wittenberg, by, venerating, the, large, collection, of, relics, at, the, church, one, could, receive, an, indulgence, he, had, preached, as, early, as, 1514, against, the, abuse, of, indulgences, and, the, way, they, cheapened, grace, rather, than, requiring, true, repentance, luther, became, especially, concerned, in, 1517, when, his, parishioners, returning, from, purchasing, tetzel, s, indulgences, claimed, that, they, no, longer, needed, to, repent, and, change, their, lives, in, order, to, be, forgiven, of, sin, after, hearing, what, tetzel, had, said, about, indulgences, in, his, sermons, luther, began, to, study, the, issue, more, carefully, and, contacted, experts, on, the, subject, he, preached, about, indulgences, several, times, in, 1517, explaining, that, true, repentance, was, better, than, purchasing, an, indulgence, he, taught, that, receiving, an, indulgence, presupposed, that, the, penitent, had, confessed, and, repented, otherwise, it, was, worthless, a, truly, repentant, sinner, would, also, not, seek, an, indulgence, because, they, loved, god, s, righteousness, and, desired, the, inward, punishment, of, their, sin, these, sermons, seem, to, have, ceased, from, april, to, october, 1517, presumably, while, luther, was, writing, the, ninety, five, theses, he, composed, a, treatise, on, indulgences, apparently, in, early, autumn, 1517, it, is, a, cautious, and, searching, examination, of, the, subject, he, contacted, church, leaders, on, the, subject, by, letter, including, his, superior, hieronymus, schulz, bishop, of, brandenburg, sometime, on, or, before, 31, october, when, he, sent, the, theses, to, archbishop, albert, of, brandenburg, the, first, thesis, states, when, our, lord, and, master, jesus, christ, said, repent, he, willed, the, entire, life, of, believers, to, be, one, of, repentance, in, the, first, few, theses, luther, develops, the, idea, of, repentance, as, the, christian, s, inner, struggle, with, sin, rather, than, the, external, system, of, sacramental, confession, theses, 5, 7, then, state, that, the, pope, who, luther, called, the, vicar, of, christ, on, earth, can, only, release, people, from, the, punishments, he, has, administered, himself, or, through, the, church, s, system, of, penance, not, the, guilt, of, sin, the, pope, can, only, announce, god, s, forgiveness, of, the, guilt, of, sin, in, his, name, in, theses, 14, 29, luther, challenged, common, beliefs, about, purgatory, theses, 14, 16, discuss, the, idea, that, the, punishment, of, purgatory, can, be, likened, to, the, fear, and, despair, felt, by, dying, people, in, theses, 17, 24, he, asserts, that, nothing, can, be, definitively, said, about, the, spiritual, state, of, people, in, purgatory, he, denies, that, the, pope, has, any, power, over, people, in, purgatory, in, theses, 25, and, 26, in, theses, 27, 29, he, attacks, the, idea, that, as, soon, as, payment, is, made, the, payer, s, loved, one, is, released, from, purgatory, he, sees, it, as, encouraging, sinful, greed, and, says, it, is, impossible, to, be, certain, because, only, god, has, ultimate, power, in, forgiving, punishments, in, purgatory, theses, 30, 34, deal, with, the, false, certainty, luther, believed, the, indulgence, preachers, offered, christians, since, no, one, knows, whether, a, person, is, truly, repentant, a, letter, assuring, a, person, of, his, forgiveness, is, dangerous, in, theses, 35, and, 36, he, attacks, the, idea, that, an, indulgence, makes, repentance, unnecessary, this, leads, to, the, conclusion, that, the, truly, repentant, person, who, alone, may, benefit, from, the, indulgence, has, already, received, the, only, benefit, the, indulgence, provides, truly, repentant, christians, have, already, according, to, luther, been, forgiven, of, the, penalty, as, well, as, the, guilt, of, sin, in, thesis, 37, he, states, that, indulgences, are, not, necessary, for, christians, to, receive, all, the, benefits, provided, by, christ, theses, 39, and, 40, argue, that, indulgences, make, true, repentance, more, difficult, true, repentance, desires, god, s, punishment, of, sin, but, indulgences, teach, one, to, avoid, punishment, since, that, is, the, purpose, of, purchasing, the, indulgence, in, theses, 41, 47, luther, criticizes, indulgences, on, the, basis, that, they, discourage, works, of, mercy, by, those, who, purchase, them, here, he, begins, to, use, the, phrase, christians, are, to, be, taught, to, state, how, he, thinks, people, should, be, instructed, on, the, value, of, indulgences, they, should, be, taught, that, giving, to, the, poor, is, incomparably, more, important, than, buying, indulgences, that, buying, an, indulgence, rather, than, giving, to, the, poor, invites, god, s, wrath, and, that, doing, good, works, makes, a, person, better, while, buying, indulgences, does, not, in, theses, 48, 52, luther, takes, the, side, of, the, pope, saying, that, if, the, pope, knew, what, was, being, preached, in, his, name, he, would, rather, st, peter, s, basilica, be, burned, down, than, built, up, with, the, skin, flesh, and, bones, of, his, sheep, theses, 53, 55, complain, about, the, restrictions, on, preaching, while, the, indulgence, was, being, offered, in, theses, 56, 66, martin, luther, criticizes, the, doctrine, of, the, treasury, of, merit, on, which, the, doctrine, of, indulgences, is, based, he, states, that, everyday, christians, do, not, understand, the, doctrine, and, are, being, misled, for, luther, the, true, treasure, of, the, church, is, the, gospel, of, jesus, christ, this, treasure, tends, to, be, hated, because, it, makes, the, first, last, in, the, words, of, matthew, 19, 30, and, 20, 16, luther, uses, metaphor, and, wordplay, to, describe, the, treasures, of, the, gospel, as, nets, to, catch, wealthy, people, whereas, the, treasures, of, indulgences, are, nets, to, catch, the, wealth, of, men, in, theses, 67, 80, luther, discusses, further, the, problems, with, the, way, indulgences, are, being, preached, as, he, had, done, in, the, letter, to, archbishop, albert, the, preachers, have, been, promoting, indulgences, as, the, greatest, of, the, graces, available, from, the, church, but, they, actually, only, promote, greed, he, points, out, that, bishops, have, been, commanded, to, offer, reverence, to, indulgence, preachers, who, enter, their, jurisdiction, but, bishops, are, also, charged, with, protecting, their, people, from, preachers, who, preach, contrary, to, the, pope, s, intention, he, then, attacks, the, belief, allegedly, propagated, by, the, preachers, that, the, indulgence, could, forgive, one, who, had, violated, the, virgin, mary, luther, states, that, indulgences, cannot, take, away, the, guilt, of, even, the, lightest, of, venial, sins, he, labels, several, other, alleged, statements, of, the, indulgence, preachers, as, blasphemy, that, saint, peter, could, not, have, granted, a, greater, indulgence, than, the, current, one, and, that, the, indulgence, cross, with, the, papal, arms, is, as, worthy, as, the, cross, of, christ, luther, lists, several, criticisms, advanced, by, laypeople, against, indulgences, in, theses, 81, 91, he, presents, these, as, difficult, objections, his, congregants, are, bringing, rather, than, his, own, criticisms, how, should, he, answer, those, who, ask, why, the, pope, does, not, simply, empty, purgatory, if, it, is, in, his, power, what, should, he, say, to, those, who, ask, why, anniversary, masses, for, the, dead, which, were, for, the, sake, of, those, in, purgatory, continued, for, those, who, had, been, redeemed, by, an, indulgence, luther, claimed, that, it, seemed, strange, to, some, that, pious, people, in, purgatory, could, be, redeemed, by, living, impious, people, luther, also, mentions, the, question, of, why, the, pope, who, is, very, rich, requires, money, from, poor, believers, to, build, st, peter, s, basilica, luther, claims, that, ignoring, these, questions, risks, allowing, people, to, ridicule, the, pope, he, appeals, to, the, pope, s, financial, interest, saying, that, if, the, preachers, limited, their, preaching, in, accordance, with, luther, s, positions, on, indulgences, which, he, claimed, was, also, the, pope, s, position, the, objections, would, cease, to, be, relevant, luther, closes, the, theses, by, exhorting, christians, to, imitate, christ, even, if, it, brings, pain, and, suffering, enduring, punishment, and, entering, heaven, is, preferable, to, false, security, the, theses, are, written, as, propositions, to, be, argued, in, a, formal, academic, disputation, though, there, is, no, evidence, that, such, an, event, ever, took, place, in, the, heading, of, the, theses, luther, invited, interested, scholars, from, other, cities, to, participate, holding, such, a, debate, was, a, privilege, luther, held, as, a, doctor, and, it, was, not, an, unusual, form, of, academic, inquiry, luther, prepared, twenty, sets, of, theses, for, disputation, at, wittenberg, between, 1516, and, 1521, andreas, karlstadt, had, written, a, set, of, such, theses, in, april, 1517, and, these, were, more, radical, in, theological, terms, than, luther, s, he, posted, them, on, the, door, of, all, saints, church, as, luther, was, alleged, to, have, done, with, the, ninety, five, theses, karlstadt, posted, his, theses, at, a, time, when, the, relics, of, the, church, were, placed, on, display, and, this, may, have, been, considered, a, provocative, gesture, similarly, luther, posted, the, ninety, five, theses, on, the, eve, of, all, saints, day, the, most, important, day, of, the, year, for, the, display, of, relics, at, all, saints, church, luther, s, theses, were, intended, to, begin, a, debate, among, academics, not, a, popular, revolution, but, there, are, indications, that, he, saw, his, action, as, prophetic, and, significant, around, this, time, he, began, using, the, name, luther, and, sometimes, eleutherius, greek, for, free, rather, than, luder, this, seems, to, refer, to, his, being, free, from, the, scholastic, theology, which, he, had, argued, against, earlier, that, year, luther, later, claimed, not, to, have, desired, the, theses, to, be, widely, distributed, elizabeth, eisenstein, has, argued, that, his, claimed, surprise, at, their, success, may, have, involved, self, deception, and, hans, hillerbrand, has, claimed, that, luther, was, certainly, intending, to, instigate, a, large, controversy, at, times, luther, seems, to, use, the, academic, nature, of, the, theses, as, a, cover, to, allow, him, to, attack, established, beliefs, while, being, able, to, deny, that, he, intended, to, attack, church, teaching, since, writing, a, set, of, theses, for, a, disputation, does, not, necessarily, commit, the, author, to, those, views, luther, could, deny, that, he, held, the, most, incendiary, ideas, in, the, theses, on, 31, october, 1517, luther, sent, a, letter, to, the, archbishop, of, mainz, albert, of, brandenburg, under, whose, authority, the, indulgences, were, being, sold, in, the, letter, luther, addresses, the, archbishop, out, of, a, loyal, desire, to, alert, him, to, the, pastoral, problems, created, by, the, indulgence, sermons, he, assumes, that, albert, is, unaware, of, what, is, being, preached, under, his, authority, and, speaks, out, of, concern, that, the, people, are, being, led, away, from, the, gospel, and, that, the, indulgence, preaching, may, bring, shame, to, albert, s, name, luther, does, not, condemn, indulgences, or, the, current, doctrine, regarding, them, nor, even, the, sermons, which, had, been, preached, themselves, as, he, had, not, seen, them, firsthand, instead, he, states, his, concern, regarding, the, misunderstandings, of, the, people, about, indulgences, which, have, been, fostered, by, the, preaching, such, as, the, belief, that, any, sin, could, be, forgiven, by, indulgences, or, that, the, guilt, as, well, as, the, punishment, for, sin, could, be, forgiven, by, an, indulgence, in, a, postscript, luther, wrote, that, albert, could, find, some, theses, on, the, matter, enclosed, with, his, letter, so, that, he, could, see, the, uncertainty, surrounding, the, doctrine, of, indulgences, in, contrast, to, the, preachers, who, spoke, so, confidently, of, the, benefits, of, indulgences, it, was, customary, when, proposing, a, disputation, to, have, the, theses, printed, by, the, university, press, and, publicly, posted, no, copies, of, a, wittenberg, printing, of, the, ninety, five, theses, have, survived, but, this, is, not, surprising, as, luther, was, not, famous, and, the, importance, of, the, document, was, not, recognized, in, wittenberg, the, university, statutes, demand, that, theses, be, posted, on, every, church, door, in, the, city, but, philip, melanchthon, who, first, mentioned, the, posting, of, the, theses, only, mentioned, the, door, of, all, saints, church, melanchthon, also, claimed, that, luther, posted, the, theses, on, 31, october, but, this, conflicts, with, several, of, luther, s, statements, about, the, course, of, events, and, luther, always, claimed, that, he, brought, his, objections, through, proper, channels, rather, than, inciting, a, public, controversy, it, is, possible, that, while, luther, later, saw, the, 31, october, letter, to, albert, as, the, beginning, of, the, reformation, he, did, not, post, the, theses, to, the, church, door, until, mid, november, but, he, may, not, have, posted, them, on, the, door, at, all, regardless, the, theses, were, well, known, among, the, wittenberg, intellectual, elite, soon, after, luther, sent, them, to, albert, the, theses, were, copied, and, distributed, to, interested, parties, soon, after, luther, sent, the, letter, to, archbishop, albert, the, latin, theses, were, printed, in, a, four, page, pamphlet, in, basel, and, as, placards, in, leipzig, and, nuremberg, in, all, several, hundred, copies, of, the, latin, theses, were, printed, in, germany, in, 1517, kaspar, n, tzel, in, nuremberg, translated, them, into, german, later, that, year, and, copies, of, this, translation, were, sent, to, several, interested, parties, across, germany, but, it, was, not, necessarily, printed, albert, seems, to, have, received, luther, s, letter, with, the, theses, around, the, end, of, november, he, requested, the, opinion, of, theologians, at, the, university, of, mainz, and, conferred, with, his, advisers, his, advisers, recommended, he, have, luther, prohibited, from, preaching, against, indulgences, in, accordance, with, the, indulgence, bull, albert, requested, such, action, from, the, roman, curia, in, rome, luther, was, immediately, perceived, as, a, threat, in, february, 1518, pope, leo, asked, the, head, of, the, augustinian, hermits, luther, s, religious, order, to, convince, him, to, stop, spreading, his, ideas, about, indulgences, sylvester, mazzolini, was, also, appointed, to, write, an, opinion, which, would, be, used, in, the, trial, against, him, mazzolini, wrote, a, dialogue, against, martin, luther, s, presumptuous, theses, concerning, the, power, of, the, pope, which, focused, on, luther, s, questioning, of, the, pope, s, authority, rather, than, his, complaints, about, indulgence, preaching, luther, received, a, summons, to, rome, in, august, 1518, he, responded, with, explanations, of, the, disputation, concerning, the, value, of, indulgences, in, which, he, attempted, to, clear, himself, of, the, charge, that, he, was, attacking, the, pope, as, he, set, down, his, views, more, extensively, luther, seems, to, have, recognized, that, the, implications, of, his, beliefs, set, him, further, from, official, teaching, than, he, initially, knew, he, later, said, he, might, not, have, begun, the, controversy, had, he, known, where, it, would, lead, the, explanations, have, been, called, luther, s, first, reformation, work, johann, tetzel, responded, to, the, theses, by, calling, for, luther, to, be, burnt, for, heresy, and, having, theologian, konrad, wimpina, write, 106, theses, against, luther, s, work, tetzel, defended, these, in, a, disputation, before, the, university, of, frankfurt, on, the, oder, in, january, 1518, 800, copies, of, the, printed, disputation, were, sent, to, be, sold, in, wittenberg, but, students, of, the, university, seized, them, from, the, bookseller, and, burned, them, luther, became, increasingly, fearful, that, the, situation, was, out, of, hand, and, that, he, would, be, in, danger, to, placate, his, opponents, he, published, a, sermon, on, indulgences, and, grace, which, did, not, challenge, the, pope, s, authority, this, pamphlet, written, in, german, was, very, short, and, easy, for, laypeople, to, understand, luther, s, first, widely, successful, work, it, was, reprinted, twenty, times, tetzel, responded, with, a, point, by, point, refutation, citing, heavily, from, the, bible, and, important, theologians, his, pamphlet, was, not, nearly, as, popular, as, luther, s, luther, s, reply, to, tetzel, s, pamphlet, on, the, other, hand, was, another, publishing, success, for, luther, another, prominent, opponent, of, the, theses, was, johann, eck, luther, s, friend, and, a, theologian, at, the, university, of, ingolstadt, eck, wrote, a, refutation, intended, for, the, bishop, of, eichst, tt, entitled, the, obelisks, this, was, in, reference, to, the, obelisks, used, to, mark, heretical, passages, in, texts, in, the, middle, ages, it, was, a, harsh, and, unexpected, personal, attack, charging, luther, with, heresy, and, stupidity, luther, responded, privately, with, the, asterisks, titled, after, the, asterisk, marks, then, used, to, highlight, important, texts, luther, s, response, was, angry, and, he, expressed, the, opinion, that, eck, did, not, understand, the, matter, on, which, he, wrote, the, dispute, between, luther, and, eck, would, become, public, in, the, 1519, leipzig, debate, luther, was, summoned, by, authority, of, the, pope, to, defend, himself, against, charges, of, heresy, before, thomas, cajetan, at, augsburg, in, october, 1518, cajetan, did, not, allow, luther, to, argue, with, him, over, his, alleged, heresies, but, he, did, identify, two, points, of, controversy, the, first, was, against, the, 58th, thesis, which, stated, that, the, pope, could, not, use, the, treasury, of, merit, to, forgive, temporal, punishment, of, sin, this, contradicted, the, papal, bull, unigenitus, promulgated, by, clement, vi, in, 1343, the, second, point, was, whether, one, could, be, assured, that, one, had, been, forgiven, when, one, s, sin, had, been, absolved, by, a, priest, luther, s, explanations, on, thesis, seven, asserted, that, one,
