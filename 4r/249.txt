https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulgate
the, vulgate, v, l, e, t, t, is, a, late, 4th, century, latin, translation, of, the, bible, it, is, largely, the, work, of, jerome, who, in, 382, had, been, commissioned, by, pope, damasus, i, to, revise, the, vetus, latina, gospels, used, by, the, roman, church, later, of, his, own, initiative, jerome, extended, this, work, of, revision, and, translation, to, include, most, of, the, books, of, the, bible, the, vulgate, became, progressively, adopted, as, the, bible, text, within, the, western, church, over, succeeding, centuries, it, eventually, eclipsed, the, vetus, latina, by, the, 13th, century, it, had, taken, over, from, the, former, version, the, designation, versio, vulgata, the, version, commonly, used, or, vulgata, for, short, the, vulgate, also, contains, some, vetus, latina, translations, that, jerome, did, not, work, on, the, catholic, church, affirmed, the, vulgate, as, its, official, latin, bible, at, the, council, of, trent, 1545, 1563, though, there, was, no, authoritative, edition, of, the, book, at, that, time, the, vulgate, did, eventually, receive, an, official, edition, to, be, promulgated, among, the, catholic, church, as, the, sixtine, vulgate, 1590, then, as, the, clementine, vulgate, 1592, and, then, as, the, nova, vulgata, 1979, the, vulgate, is, still, currently, used, in, the, latin, church, the, clementine, edition, of, the, vulgate, became, the, standard, bible, text, of, the, roman, rite, of, the, catholic, church, and, remained, so, until, 1979, when, the, nova, vulgata, was, promulgated, the, term, vulgate, has, been, used, to, designate, the, latin, bible, only, since, the, 16th, century, an, example, of, the, use, of, this, word, in, this, sense, at, the, time, is, the, title, of, the, 1538, edition, of, the, latin, bible, by, erasmus, biblia, utriusque, testamenti, juxta, vulgatam, translationem, while, the, majority, of, the, vulgate, s, translation, is, traditionally, attributed, to, jerome, the, vulgate, has, a, compound, text, that, is, not, entirely, jerome, s, work, jerome, s, translation, of, the, four, gospels, are, revisions, of, vetus, latina, translations, he, did, while, having, the, greek, as, reference, the, latin, translations, of, the, rest, of, the, new, testament, are, revisions, to, the, vetus, latina, considered, as, being, made, by, pelagian, circles, or, by, rufinus, the, syrian, or, by, rufinus, of, aquileia, several, unrevised, books, of, the, vetus, latina, old, testament, also, commonly, became, included, in, the, vulgate, these, are, 1, and, 2, maccabees, wisdom, ecclesiasticus, baruch, and, the, letter, of, jeremiah, having, separately, translated, the, book, of, psalms, from, the, greek, hexapla, septuagint, jerome, translated, all, of, the, books, of, the, jewish, bible, the, hebrew, book, of, psalms, included, from, hebrew, himself, he, also, translated, the, books, of, tobit, and, judith, from, aramaic, versions, the, additions, to, the, book, of, esther, from, the, common, septuagint, and, the, additions, to, the, book, of, daniel, from, the, greek, of, theodotion, the, vulgate, is, a, composite, collection, which, cannot, be, identified, with, only, jerome, s, work, because, the, vulgate, contains, vetus, latina, which, are, independent, from, jerome, s, work, the, alcuinian, pandects, contain, the, 13th, century, paris, bibles, remove, the, epistle, to, the, laodiceans, but, add, another, text, which, is, considered, as, part, of, the, vulgate, is, jerome, did, not, embark, on, the, work, with, the, intention, of, creating, a, new, version, of, the, whole, bible, but, the, changing, nature, of, his, program, can, be, tracked, in, his, voluminous, correspondence, he, had, been, commissioned, by, damasus, i, in, 382, to, revise, the, vetus, latina, text, of, the, four, gospels, from, the, best, greek, texts, by, the, time, of, damasus, death, in, 384, jerome, had, completed, this, task, together, with, a, more, cursory, revision, from, the, greek, common, septuagint, of, the, vetus, latina, text, of, the, psalms, in, the, roman, psalter, a, version, which, he, later, disowned, and, is, now, lost, how, much, of, the, rest, of, the, new, testament, he, then, revised, is, difficult, to, judge, but, none, of, his, work, survived, in, the, vulgate, text, of, these, books, the, revised, text, of, the, new, testament, outside, the, gospels, is, the, work, of, other, scholars, rufinus, of, aquileia, has, been, suggested, as, has, rufinus, the, syrian, an, associate, of, pelagius, and, pelagius, himself, though, without, specific, evidence, for, any, of, them, pelagian, groups, have, also, been, suggested, as, the, revisers, this, unknown, reviser, worked, more, thoroughly, than, jerome, had, done, consistently, using, older, greek, manuscript, sources, of, alexandrian, text, type, they, had, published, a, complete, revised, new, testament, text, by, 410, at, the, latest, when, pelagius, quoted, from, it, in, his, commentary, on, the, letters, of, paul, in, jerome, s, vulgate, the, hebrew, book, of, ezra, nehemiah, is, translated, as, the, single, book, of, ezra, jerome, defends, this, in, his, prologue, to, ezra, although, he, had, noted, formerly, in, his, prologue, to, the, book, of, kings, that, some, greeks, and, latins, had, proposed, that, this, book, should, be, split, in, two, jerome, argues, that, the, two, books, of, ezra, found, in, the, septuagint, and, vetus, latina, esdras, a, and, esdras, b, represented, variant, examples, of, a, single, hebrew, original, hence, he, does, not, translate, esdras, a, separately, even, though, up, until, then, it, had, been, universally, found, in, greek, and, vetus, latina, old, testaments, preceding, esdras, b, the, combined, text, of, ezra, nehemiah, the, vulgate, is, usually, credited, as, being, the, first, translation, of, the, old, testament, into, latin, directly, from, the, hebrew, tanakh, rather, than, from, the, greek, septuagint, jerome, s, extensive, use, of, exegetical, material, written, in, greek, as, well, as, his, use, of, the, aquiline, and, theodotiontic, columns, of, the, hexapla, along, with, the, somewhat, paraphrastic, style, in, which, he, translated, makes, it, difficult, to, determine, exactly, how, direct, the, conversion, of, hebrew, to, latin, was, augustine, of, hippo, a, contemporary, of, jerome, states, in, book, xvii, ch, 43, of, his, the, city, of, god, that, in, our, own, day, the, priest, jerome, a, great, scholar, and, master, of, all, three, tongues, has, made, a, translation, into, latin, not, from, greek, but, directly, from, the, original, hebrew, nevertheless, augustine, still, maintained, that, the, septuagint, alongside, the, hebrew, witnessed, the, inspired, text, of, scripture, and, consequently, pressed, jerome, for, complete, copies, of, his, hexaplar, latin, translation, of, the, old, testament, a, request, that, jerome, ducked, with, the, excuse, that, the, originals, had, been, lost, through, someone, s, dishonesty, prologues, written, by, jerome, to, some, of, his, translations, of, parts, of, the, bible, are, to, the, pentateuch, to, joshua, and, to, kings, 1, 2, kings, and, 1, 2, samuel, which, is, also, called, the, galeatum, principium, following, these, are, prologues, to, chronicles, ezra, tobit, judith, esther, job, the, gallican, psalms, song, of, songs, isaiah, jeremiah, ezekiel, daniel, the, minor, prophets, the, gospels, the, final, prologue, is, to, the, pauline, epistles, and, is, better, known, as, primum, quaeritur, this, prologue, is, considered, not, to, have, been, written, by, jerome, related, to, these, are, jerome, s, notes, on, the, rest, of, esther, and, his, prologue, to, the, hebrew, psalms, a, theme, of, the, old, testament, prologues, is, jerome, s, preference, for, the, hebraica, veritas, i, e, hebrew, truth, over, the, septuagint, a, preference, which, he, defended, from, his, detractors, after, jerome, had, translated, some, parts, of, the, septuagint, into, latin, he, came, to, consider, the, text, of, the, septuagint, as, being, faulty, in, itself, i, e, jerome, thought, mistakes, in, the, septuagint, text, were, not, all, mistakes, made, by, copyists, but, that, some, mistakes, were, part, of, the, original, text, itself, as, it, was, produced, by, the, seventy, translators, jerome, believed, that, the, hebrew, text, more, clearly, prefigured, christ, than, the, greek, of, the, septuagint, since, he, believed, some, quotes, of, the, old, testament, in, the, new, testament, were, not, present, in, the, septuagint, but, existed, in, the, hebrew, version, jerome, gave, some, of, those, quotes, in, his, prologue, to, the, pentateuch, in, the, galeatum, principium, a, k, a, prologus, galeatus, jerome, described, an, old, testament, canon, of, 22, books, which, he, found, represented, in, the, 22, letter, hebrew, alphabet, alternatively, he, numbered, the, books, as, 24, which, he, identifies, with, the, 24, elders, in, the, book, of, revelation, casting, their, crowns, before, the, lamb, in, the, prologue, to, ezra, he, sets, the, twenty, four, elders, of, the, hebrew, bible, against, the, seventy, interpreters, of, the, septuagint, in, addition, many, medieval, vulgate, manuscripts, included, jerome, s, epistle, number, 53, to, paulinus, bishop, of, nola, as, a, general, prologue, to, the, whole, bible, notably, this, letter, was, printed, at, the, head, of, the, gutenberg, bible, jerome, s, letter, promotes, the, study, of, each, of, the, books, of, the, old, and, new, testaments, listed, by, name, and, excluding, any, mention, of, the, deuterocanonical, books, and, its, dissemination, had, the, effect, of, propagating, the, belief, that, the, whole, vulgate, text, was, jerome, s, work, the, prologue, to, the, pauline, epistles, in, the, vulgate, defends, the, pauline, authorship, of, the, epistle, to, the, hebrews, directly, contrary, to, jerome, s, own, views, a, key, argument, in, demonstrating, that, jerome, did, not, write, it, the, author, of, the, primum, quaeritur, is, unknown, but, it, is, first, quoted, by, pelagius, in, his, commentary, on, the, pauline, letters, written, before, 410, as, this, work, also, quotes, from, the, vulgate, revision, of, these, letters, it, has, been, proposed, that, pelagius, or, one, of, his, associates, may, have, been, responsible, for, the, revision, of, the, vulgate, new, testament, outside, the, gospels, at, any, rate, it, is, reasonable, to, identify, the, author, of, the, preface, with, the, unknown, reviser, of, the, new, testament, outside, the, gospels, some, manuscripts, of, the, pauline, epistles, contain, short, marcionite, prologues, to, each, of, the, epistles, indicating, where, they, were, written, with, notes, about, where, the, recipients, dwelt, adolf, von, harnack, citing, de, bruyne, argued, that, these, notes, were, written, by, marcion, of, sinope, or, one, of, his, followers, many, early, vulgate, manuscripts, contain, a, set, of, priscillianist, prologues, to, the, gospels, the, latin, biblical, texts, in, use, before, jerome, s, vulgate, are, usually, referred, to, collectively, as, the, vetus, latina, or, vetus, latina, bible, vetus, latina, means, that, they, are, older, than, the, vulgate, and, written, in, latin, not, that, they, are, written, in, old, latin, jerome, himself, uses, the, term, latin, vulgate, for, the, vetus, latina, text, so, intending, to, denote, this, version, as, the, common, latin, rendering, of, the, greek, vulgate, or, common, septuagint, which, jerome, otherwise, terms, the, seventy, interpreters, this, remained, the, usual, use, of, the, term, latin, vulgate, in, the, west, for, centuries, on, occasion, jerome, applies, the, term, septuagint, septuaginta, to, refer, to, the, hexaplar, septuagint, where, he, wishes, to, distinguish, this, from, the, vulgata, or, common, septuagint, the, earliest, known, use, of, the, term, vulgata, to, describe, the, new, latin, translation, was, made, by, roger, bacon, in, the, 13th, century, the, translations, in, the, vetus, latina, had, accumulated, piecemeal, over, a, century, or, more, they, were, not, translated, by, a, single, person, or, institution, nor, uniformly, edited, the, individual, books, varied, in, quality, of, translation, and, style, and, different, manuscripts, and, quotations, witness, wide, variations, in, readings, some, books, appear, to, have, been, translated, several, times, the, book, of, psalms, in, particular, had, circulated, for, over, a, century, in, an, earlier, latin, version, the, cyprianic, version, before, it, was, superseded, by, the, vetus, latina, version, in, the, 4th, century, jerome, in, his, preface, to, the, vulgate, gospels, commented, that, there, were, as, many, as, there, are, manuscripts, subsequently, repeating, the, witticism, in, his, preface, to, the, book, of, joshua, the, base, text, for, jerome, s, revision, of, the, gospels, was, a, vetus, latina, text, similar, to, the, codex, veronensis, with, the, text, of, the, gospel, of, john, conforming, more, to, that, in, the, codex, corbiensis, jerome, s, work, on, the, gospels, was, a, revision, of, the, vetus, latina, versions, and, not, a, new, translation, high, priest, is, rendered, princeps, sacerdotum, in, vulgate, matthew, as, summus, sacerdos, in, vulgate, mark, and, as, pontifex, in, vulgate, john, the, vetus, latina, gospels, had, been, translated, from, greek, originals, of, the, western, text, type, comparison, of, jerome, s, gospel, texts, with, those, in, vetus, latina, witnesses, suggests, that, his, revision, was, concerned, with, substantially, redacting, their, expanded, western, phraseology, in, accordance, with, the, greek, texts, of, better, early, byzantine, and, alexandrian, witnesses, one, major, change, jerome, introduced, was, to, re, order, the, latin, gospels, most, vetus, latina, gospel, books, followed, the, western, order, of, matthew, john, luke, mark, jerome, adopted, the, greek, order, of, matthew, mark, luke, john, his, revisions, became, progressively, less, frequent, and, less, consistent, in, the, gospels, presumably, done, later, in, places, jerome, adopted, readings, that, did, not, correspond, to, a, straightforward, rendering, either, of, the, vetus, latina, or, the, greek, text, so, reflecting, a, particular, doctrinal, interpretation, as, in, his, rewording, panem, nostrum, supersubstantialem, at, matthew, 6, 11, the, unknown, reviser, of, the, rest, of, the, new, testament, shows, marked, differences, from, jerome, both, in, editorial, practice, and, in, their, sources, where, jerome, sought, to, correct, the, vetus, latina, text, with, reference, to, the, best, recent, greek, manuscripts, with, a, preference, for, those, conforming, to, the, byzantine, text, type, the, greek, text, underlying, the, revision, of, the, rest, of, the, new, testament, demonstrates, the, alexandrian, text, type, found, in, the, great, uncial, codices, of, the, mid, 4th, century, most, similar, to, the, codex, sinaiticus, the, reviser, s, changes, generally, conform, very, closely, to, this, greek, text, even, in, matters, of, word, order, to, the, extent, that, the, resulting, text, may, be, only, barely, intelligible, as, latin, after, the, gospels, the, most, widely, used, and, copied, part, of, the, christian, bible, is, the, book, of, psalms, consequently, damasus, also, commissioned, jerome, to, revise, the, psalter, in, use, in, rome, to, agree, better, with, the, greek, of, the, common, septuagint, jerome, said, he, had, done, this, cursorily, when, in, rome, but, he, later, disowned, this, version, maintaining, that, copyists, had, reintroduced, erroneous, readings, until, the, 20th, century, it, was, commonly, assumed, that, the, surviving, roman, psalter, represented, jerome, s, first, attempted, revision, but, more, recent, scholarship, following, de, bruyne, rejects, this, identification, the, roman, psalter, is, indeed, one, of, at, least, five, revised, versions, of, the, mid, 4th, century, vetus, latina, psalter, but, compared, to, the, other, four, the, revisions, in, the, roman, psalter, are, in, clumsy, latin, and, fail, to, follow, jerome, s, known, translational, principles, especially, in, respect, of, correcting, harmonised, readings, nevertheless, it, is, clear, from, jerome, s, correspondence, especially, in, his, defence, of, the, gallican, psalter, in, the, long, and, detailed, epistle, 106, that, he, was, familiar, with, the, roman, psalter, text, and, consequently, it, is, assumed, that, this, revision, represents, the, roman, text, as, jerome, had, found, it, wisdom, ecclesiasticus, 1, and, 2, maccabees, and, baruch, with, the, letter, of, jeremiah, are, included, in, the, vulgate, and, are, purely, vetus, latina, translations, which, jerome, did, not, touch, in, the, 9th, century, the, vetus, latina, texts, of, baruch, and, the, letter, of, jeremiah, were, introduced, into, the, vulgate, in, versions, revised, by, theodulf, of, orleans, and, are, found, in, a, minority, of, early, medieval, vulgate, pandect, bibles, from, that, date, onward, after, 1300, when, the, booksellers, of, paris, began, to, produce, commercial, single, volume, vulgate, bibles, in, large, numbers, these, commonly, included, both, baruch, and, the, letter, of, jeremiah, as, the, book, of, baruch, also, beginning, in, the, 9th, century, vulgate, manuscripts, are, found, that, split, jerome, s, combined, translation, from, the, hebrew, of, ezra, and, the, nehemiah, into, separate, books, called, 1, ezra, and, 2, ezra, bogaert, argues, that, this, practice, arose, from, an, intention, to, conform, the, vulgate, text, to, the, authoritative, canon, lists, of, the, 5th, 6th, century, where, two, books, of, ezra, were, commonly, cited, subsequently, many, late, medieval, vulgate, bible, manuscripts, introduced, a, latin, version, originating, from, before, jerome, and, distinct, from, that, in, the, vetus, latina, of, the, greek, esdras, a, now, commonly, termed, 3, ezra, and, also, a, latin, version, of, an, ezra, apocalypse, commonly, termed, 4, ezra, god, schools, relations, with, the, vulgate, was, given, an, official, capacity, by, the, council, of, trent, 1545, 1563, as, the, touchstone, of, the, biblical, canon, concerning, which, parts, of, books, are, canonical, the, vulgate, was, declared, to, be, held, as, authentic, by, the, catholic, church, by, the, council, of, trent, the, council, of, trent, cited, long, usage, in, support, of, the, vulgate, s, magisterial, authority, moreover, this, sacred, and, holy, synod, considering, that, no, small, utility, may, accrue, to, the, church, of, god, if, it, be, made, known, which, out, of, all, the, latin, editions, now, in, circulation, of, the, sacred, books, is, to, be, held, as, authentic, ordains, and, declares, that, the, said, old, and, vulgate, edition, which, by, the, lengthened, usage, of, so, many, years, has, been, approved, of, in, the, church, be, in, public, lectures, disputations, sermons, and, expositions, held, as, authentic, and, that, no, one, is, to, dare, or, presume, to, reject, it, under, any, pretext, whatever, the, qualifier, latin, editions, now, in, circulation, and, the, use, of, authentic, not, inerrant, show, the, limits, of, this, statement, when, the, council, listed, the, books, included, in, the, canon, it, qualified, the, books, as, being, entire, with, all, their, parts, as, they, have, been, used, to, be, read, in, the, catholic, church, and, as, they, are, contained, in,

the, 20th, century, pope, pius, xii, declared, the, vulgate, as, free, from, error, whatsoever, in, matters, of, faith, and, morals, in, his, encyclical, divino, afflante, spiritu, hence, this, special, authority, or, as, they, say, authenticity, of, the, vulgate, was, not, affirmed, by, the, council, particularly, for, critical, reasons, but, rather, because, of, its, legitimate, use, in, the, churches, throughout, so, many, centuries, by, which, use, indeed, the, same, is, shown, in, the, sense, in, which, the, church, has, understood, and, understands, it, to, be, free, from, any, error, whatsoever, in, matters, of, faith, and, morals, so, that, as, the, church, herself, testifies, and, affirms, it, may, be, quoted, safely, and, without, fear, of, error, in, disputations, in, lectures, and, in, preaching, the, inerrancy, is, with, respect, to, faith, and, morals, as, it, says, in, the, above, quote, free, from, any, error, whatsoever, in, matters, of, faith, and, morals, and, the, inerrancy, is, not, in, a, philological, sense, and, so, its, authenticity, is, not, specified, primarily, as, critical, but, rather, as, juridical, the, catholic, church, has, produced,

the, most, commonly, used, edition, of, the, most, influential, text, in, western, european, society, indeed, for, most, western, christians, especially, catholics, it, was, the, only, version, of, the, bible, ever, encountered, only, truly, being, eclipsed, in, the, mid, 20th, century, in, about, 1455, the, first, vulgate, published, by, the, moveable, type, process, was, produced, in, mainz,

revisions, of, the, latin, scriptures, in, the, early, medieval, period, were, made, in, the, carolingian, period, by, alcuin, of, york, c, 730, 840, and, theodulf, of, orleans, 750, 760, 821, alcuin, of, york, oversaw, efforts, to, make, a, latin, bible, an, exemplar, of, which, was, presented, to, charlemagne, in, 801, alcuin, s, edition, contained, the, vulgate, version, it, appears, alcuin, concentrated, only, on, correcting, errors, of, grammar, orthography, and, punctuation, even, though, alcuin, s, revision, of, the, latin, bible, was, neither, the, first, nor, the, last, of, the, carolingian, period, it, managed, to, prevail, over, the, other, versions, and, to, become, the, most, influential, edition, for, centuries, to, come, the, success, of, this, bible, has, been, attributed, to, the, fact, that, this, bible, may, have, been, prescribed, as, the, official, version, at, the, emperor, s, request, however, bonifatius, fischer, believes, its, success, was, rather, due, to, the, productivity, of, the, scribes, of, tours, where, alcuin, was, abbot, at, the, monastery, of, saint, martin, fischer, believes, the, emperor, only, favored, the, editorial, work, of, alcuin, by, encouraging, work, on, the, bible, in, general, although, in, contrast, to, alcuin, theodulf, clearly, developed, an, editorial, programme, his, work, on, the, bible, was, far, less, influential, than, that, of, hs, slightly, older, contemporary, nevertheless, several, manuscripts, containing, his, version, have, come, down, to, us, theodulf, added, to, his, edition, of, the, bible, the, book, of, baruch, which, alcuin, s, edition, did, not, contain, it, is, this, version, of, the, book, of, baruch, which, later, became, part, of, the, vulgate, in, his, editorial,

and, the, letter, of, jeremiah, were, introduced, into, the, vulgate, in, versions, revised, by, theodulf, of, orleans, and, are, found, in, a, minority, of, early, medieval, vulgate, pandect, bibles, from, that, date, onward, cassiodorus, isidore, of, sevilla, and, stephen, harding, also, worked, on, editions, of, the, latin, bible, isidore, s, edition, as, well, as, the, edition, of, cassiodorus, ha, not, come, down, to, us, by, the, 9th, century, due, to, the, success, of, alcuin, s, edition, the, vulgate, had, replaced, the, vetus, latina, as, the, most, available, edition, of, the, latin, bible, the, university, of, paris, the, dominicans, and, the, franciscans, assembled, lists, of, correctoria, approved, readings, where, variants, had, been, noted, though, the, advent, of, printing, greatly, reduced, the, potential, of, human, error, and, increased, the, consistency, and, uniformity, of, the, text, the, earliest, editions, of, the, vulgate, merely, reproduced, the, manuscripts, that, were, readily, available, to, publishers, of, the, hundreds, of, early, editions, the, most, notable, today, is, the, mazarin, edition, published, by, johann, gutenberg, and, johann, fust, in, 1455, famous, for, its, beauty, and, antiquity, in, 1504, the, first, vulgate, with, variant, readings, was, published, in, paris, one, of, the, texts, of, the, complutensian, polyglot, was, an, edition, of, the, vulgate, made, from, ancient, manuscripts, and, corrected, to, agree, with, the, greek, erasmus, published, an, edition, corrected, to, agree, better, with, the, greek, and, hebrew, in, 1516, other, corrected, editions, were, published, by, xanthus, pagninus, in, 1518, cardinal, cajetan, augustinus, steuchius, in, 1529, abbot, isidorus, clarius, venice, 1542, and, others, in, 1528, robertus, stephanus, published, the, first, of, a, series, of, critical, editions, which, formed, the, basis, of, the, later, sistine, and, clementine, editions, john, henten, s, critical, edition, of, the, bible, followed, in, 1547, in, 1550, stephanus, fled, to, geneva, where, he, issued, his, final, critical, edition, of, the, vulgate, in, 1555, this, was, the, first, complete, bible, with, full, chapter, and, verse, divisions, and, became, the, standard, biblical, reference, text, for, late, 16th, century, reformed, theology, after, the, reformation, when, the, catholic, church, strove, to, counter, protestantism, and, refute, its, doctrines, the, vulgate, was, declared, at, the, council, of, trent, to, be, in, public, lectures, disputations, sermons, and, expositions, held, as, authentic, and, that, no, one, is, to, dare, or, presume, to, reject, it, under, any, pretext, whatever, furthermore, the, council, expressed, the, wish, that, the, vulgate, be, printed, quam, emendatissime, with, fewest, possible, faults, in, 1590, the, sixtine, vulgate, was, issued, under, sixtus, v, as, being, the, official, bible, recommended, by, the, council, of, trent, on, 27, august, 1590, sixtus, v, died, after, his, death, many, claimed, that, the, text, of, the, sixtine, vulgate, was, too, error, ridden, for, general, use, on, 5, september, of, the, same, year, the, college, of, cardinals, stopped, all, further, sales, of, the, sixtine, vulgate, and, bought, and, destroyed, as, many, copies, as, possible, by, burning, them, the, reason, invoked, for, this, action, was, printing, inaccuracies, in, sixtus, v, s, edition, of, the, vulgate, however, bruce, metzger, an, american, biblical, scholar, believes, that, the, printing, inaccuracies, may, have, been, a, pretext, and, that, the, attack, against, this, edition, had, been, instigated, by, the, jesuits, whom, sixtus, had, offended, by, putting, one, of, bellarmine, s, books, on, the, index, in, the, same, year, he, became, pope, 1592, clement, viii, recalled, all, copies, of, the, sixtine, vulgate, the, reason, invoked, for, recalling, sixtus, v, s, edition, was, printing, errors, however, the, sixtine, vulgate, was, mostly, free, of, them, the, sistine, edition, was, replaced, by, clement, viii, 1592, 1605, this, new, edition, was, published, in, 1592, and, is, called, today, the, clementine, vulgate, or, sixto, clementine, vulgate, the, misprints, of, this, edition, were, partly, eliminated, in, a, second, 1593, and, a, third, 1598, edition, the, clementine, vulgate, is, the, edition, most, familiar, to, catholics, who, have, lived, prior, to, the, liturgical, reforms, following, vatican, ii, roger, gryson, in, the, preface, to, the, 4th, edition, of, the, stuttgart, vulgate, 1994, asserts, that, the, clementine, edition, frequently, deviates, from, the, manuscript, tradition, for, literary, or, doctrinal, reasons, and, offers, only, a, faint, reflection, of, the, original, vulgate, as, read, in, the, pandecta, of, the, first, millennium, however, historical, scholar, cardinal, francis, aidan, gasquet, in, the, catholic, encyclopedia, states, that, the, clementine, vulgate, substantially, represents, the, vulgate, which, jerome, produced, in, the, fourth, century, although, it, stands, in, need, of, close, examination, and, much, correction, to, make, it, agree, with, the, translation, of, st, jerome, most, other, later, editions, were, limited, to, the, new, testament, and, did, not, present, a, full, critical, apparatus, most, notably, karl, lachmann, s, editions, of, 1842, and, 1850, based, primarily, on, the, codex, amiatinus, and, the, codex, fuldensis, fleck, s, edition, of, 1840, and, constantin, von, tischendorf, s, edition, of, 1864, in, 1906, eberhard, nestle, published, novum, testamentum, latine, which, presented, the, clementine, vulgate, text, with, a, critical, apparatus, comparing, it, to, the, editions, of, sixtus, v, 1590, lachman, 1842, tischendorf, 1854, and, wordsworth, and, white, 1889, as, well, as, the, codex, amiatinus, and, the, codex, fuldensis, to, make, a, text, available, representative, of, the, earliest, copies, of, the, vulgate, and, summarise, the, most, common, variants, between, the, various, manuscripts, anglican, scholars, at, the, university, of, oxford, began, to, edit, the, new, testament, in, 1878, completed, in, 1954, while, the, benedictines, of, rome, began, an, edition, of, the, old, testament, in, 1907, completed, in, 1995, the, oxford, anglican, scholars, s, findings, were, condensed, into, an, edition, of, both, the, old, and, new, testaments, first, published, at, stuttgart, in, 1969, created, with, the, participation, of, members, from, both, projects, these, books, are, the, standard, editions, of, the, vulgate, used, by, scholars, as, a, result, of, the, inaccuracy, of, existing, editions, of, the, vulgate, in, 1878, the, delegates, of, the, oxford, university, press, accepted, a, proposal, from, classicist, john, wordsworth, to, produce, a, critical, edition, of, the, new, testament, this, was, eventually, published, as, nouum, testamentum, domini, nostri, iesu, christi, latine, secundum, editionem, sancti, hieronymi, in, three, volumes, between, 1889, and, 1954, the, edition, commonly, known, as, the, oxford, vulgate, relies, primarily, on, the, texts, of, the, codex, amiatinus, codex, fuldensis, codex, harleianus, in, the, gospels, codex, sangermanensis, codex, mediolanensis, in, the, gospels, and, codex, reginensis, in, paul, it, also, consistently, cites, readings, in, the, so, called, delqr, group, of, manuscripts, named, after, the, sigla, it, uses, for, them, book, of, armagh, d, egerton, gospels,

benedictine, edition, was, no, longer, required, for, official, purposes, and, the, abbey, was, suppressed, in, 1984, five, monks, were, nonetheless, allowed, to, complete, the, final, two, volumes, of, the, old, testament, which, were, published, under, the, abbey, s, name, in, 1987, and, 1995, based, on, the, editions, of, oxford, and, rome, but, with, an, independent, examination, of, the,
