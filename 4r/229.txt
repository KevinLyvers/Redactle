the, apology, of, socrates, greek, apolog, a, sokr, tous, latin, apologia, socratis, written, by, plato, is, a, socratic, dialogue, of, the, speech, of, legal, self, defence, which, socrates, 469, 399, bc, spoke, at, his, trial, for, impiety, and, corruption, in, 399, bc, specifically, the, apology, of, socrates, is, a, defence, against, the, charges, of, corrupting, the, youth, and, not, believing, in, the, gods, in, whom, the, city, believes, but, in, other, daimonia, that, are, novel, to, athens, 24b, among, the, primary, sources, about, the, trial, and, death, of, the, philosopher, socrates, the, apology, of, socrates, is, the, dialogue, that, depicts, the, trial, and, is, one, of, four, socratic, dialogues, along, with, euthyphro, phaedo, and, crito, through, which, plato, details, the, final, days, of, the, philosopher, socrates, the, apology, of, socrates, by, the, philosopher, plato, 429, 347, bc, was, one, of, many, explanatory, apologiae, about, socrates, s, legal, defence, against, accusations, of, corruption, and, impiety, most, apologiae, were, published, in, the, decade, after, the, trial, of, socrates, 399, bc, as, such, plato, s, apology, of, socrates, is, an, early, philosophic, defence, of, socrates, presented, in, the, form, of, a, socratic, dialogue, although, aristotle, later, classified, it, as, a, genre, of, fiction, it, is, still, a, useful, historical, source, about, socrates, 469, 399, bc, the, philosopher, aristotle, believed, the, dialogue, particularly, the, scene, where, socrates, questions, meletus, represented, a, good, use, of, interrogation, except, for, socrates, s, two, dialogues, with, meletus, about, the, nature, and, logic, of, his, accusations, of, impiety, the, text, of, the, apology, of, socrates, is, in, the, first, person, perspective, and, voice, of, the, philosopher, socrates, 24d, 25d, and, 26b, 27d, moreover, during, the, trial, in, his, speech, of, self, defence, socrates, twice, mentions, that, plato, is, present, at, the, trial, 34a, and, 38b, the, apology, of, socrates, begins, with, socrates, addressing, the, jury, of, perhaps, 500, athenian, men, to, ask, if, they, have, been, persuaded, by, the, orators, lycon, anytus, and, meletus, who, have, accused, socrates, of, corrupting, the, young, people, of, the, city, and, impiety, against, the, pantheon, of, athens, the, first, sentence, of, his, speech, establishes, the, theme, of, the, dialogue, that, philosophy, begins, with, an, admission, of, ignorance, socrates, later, clarifies, that, point, of, philosophy, when, he, says, that, whatever, wisdom, he, possesses, comes, from, knowing, that, he, knows, nothing, 23b, 29b, in, the, course, of, the, trial, socrates, imitates, parodies, and, corrects, the, orators, his, accusers, and, asks, the, jury, to, judge, him, by, the, truth, of, his, statements, not, by, his, oratorical, skill, cf, lysias, xix, 1, 2, 3, isaeus, x, 1, isocrates, xv, 79, aeschines, ii, 24, socrates, says, he, will, not, use, sophisticated, language, carefully, arranged, ornate, words, and, phrases, but, will, speak, using, the, common, idiom, of, the, greek, language, socrates, says, that, he, will, speak, in, the, manner, he, has, used, in, the, agora, and, at, the, money, tables, which, he, states, is, his, native, tongue, and, the, fashion, of, his, country, although, offered, the, opportunity, to, appease, the, prejudices, of, the, jury, with, a, minimal, concession, to, the, charges, of, corruption, and, impiety, socrates, does, not, yield, his, integrity, to, avoid, the, penalty, of, death, the, jury, condemns, socrates, to, death, in, the, society, of, 5th, century, bc, athens, the, three, men, who, formally, accused, the, philosopher, socrates, of, impiety, and, corruption, against, the, people, and, the, city, officially, represented, the, interests, of, the, politicians, and, the, craftsmen, of, the, scholars, poets, and, rhetoricians, the, accusers, of, socrates, were, in, his, defence, at, trial, socrates, faced, two, sets, of, accusations, i, asebeia, impiety, against, the, pantheon, of, athens, by, introducing, new, gods, and, ii, corruption, of, athenian, youth, by, teaching, them, to, doubt, the, status, quo, socrates, says, to, the, court, that, these, old, accusations, arise, from, years, of, gossip, and, prejudice, against, him, hence, are, matters, difficult, to, address, he, then, reformulates, the, diffuse, accusations, from, the, orators, against, him, into, the, proper, legal, form, socrates, is, committing, an, injustice, in, that, he, inquires, into, things, below, the, earth, and, in, the, sky, and, makes, the, weaker, argument, the, stronger, and, teaches, others, to, follow, his, example, 19b, c, socrates, also, says, that, the, accusations, for, which, he, is, answering, in, court, already, had, been, spoken, and, published, by, the, comic, poet, aristophanes, and, are, therefore, beyond, the, legal, scope, of, a, trial, for, corruption, and, impiety, years, earlier, in, the, play, the, clouds, 423, bc, aristophanes, lampooned, socrates, as, a, charlatan, the, paradigm, philosopher, of, atheist, and, scientific, sophistry, carefully, arranged, arguments, constructed, of, ornate, words, and, phrases, misrepresented, as, wisdom, in, light, of, that, definition, socrates, defensively, argues, that, he, cannot, be, mistaken, for, a, sophist, philosopher, because, sophists, are, wise, men, are, thought, to, be, wise, by, the, people, of, athens, and, thus, are, highly, paid, for, their, teaching, whereas, he, socrates, lives, in, ten, thousand, fold, poverty, and, knows, nothing, noble, and, good, 23c, for, his, self, defence, socrates, first, eliminates, any, claim, that, he, is, a, wise, man, he, says, that, chaerephon, reputed, to, be, impetuous, went, to, the, oracle, of, delphi, and, asked, her, the, prophetess, pythia, to, tell, him, of, anyone, wiser, than, socrates, the, pythia, answered, to, chaerephon, that, there, was, no, man, wiser, on, learning, of, that, oracular, pronouncement, socrates, says, he, was, astounded, because, on, the, one, hand, it, is, against, the, nature, of, the, oracle, to, lie, but, on, the, other, hand, he, knew, he, was, not, wise, therefore, socrates, sought, to, find, someone, wiser, than, himself, so, that, he, could, take, that, person, as, evidence, to, the, oracle, at, delphi, hence, why, socrates, minutely, queried, everyone, who, appeared, to, be, a, wise, person, in, that, vein, he, tested, the, minds, of, politicians, poets, and, scholars, for, wisdom, although, he, occasionally, found, genius, socrates, says, that, he, found, no, one, who, possessed, wisdom, yet, each, man, was, thought, wise, by, the, people, and, each, man, thought, himself, wise, therefore, he, thought, he, was, the, better, man, because, he, was, aware, that, he, was, not, wise, socrates, explained, that, the, young, rich, men, of, the, city, of, athens, have, little, to, do, with, their, time, they, therefore, follow, him, about, the, city, observing, his, questioning, of, intellectual, arguments, in, dialogue, with, other, intellectual, men, in, turn, young, men, imitate, the, method, of, socrates, socrates, thought, that, the, arguments, of, the, men, he, examined, were, wanting, and, when, he, said, this, to, not, lose, face, they, would, restate, stock, accusations, against, socrates, that, he, is, a, morally, abominable, man, who, corrupts, the, youth, of, athens, with, sophistry, and, atheism, in, his, defence, socrates, said, for, those, who, are, examined, instead, of, being, angry, with, themselves, are, angry, with, me, the, apology, of, socrates, by, plato, is, a, socratic, dialogue, in, three, parts, that, cover, the, trial, of, socrates, 399, bc, i, the, legal, self, defence, of, socrates, ii, the, verdict, of, the, jury, and, iii, the, sentence, of, the, court, socrates, begins, his, legal, defence, by, telling, the, jury, that, their, minds, were, poisoned, by, his, enemies, when, they, the, jury, were, young, and, impressionable, he, also, says, that, his, false, reputation, as, a, sophistical, philosopher, comes, from, his, enemies, and, that, all, of, them, are, malicious, yet, must, remain, nameless, except, for, the, playwright, aristophanes, who, lampooned, him, socrates, as, a, charlatan, philosopher, in, the, comedy, play, the, clouds, 423, bc, about, corrupting, the, rich, young, men, of, athens, socrates, argues, that, deliberate, corruption, is, an, illogical, action, because, it, would, hurt, him, as, well, he, says, that, the, accusations, of, him, being, a, corrupter, of, youth, began, at, the, time, of, his, obedience, to, the, oracle, at, delphi, and, tells, how, chaerephon, went, to, the, oracle, to, ask, her, the, pythian, prophetess, if, there, was, a, man, wiser, than, socrates, when, chaerephon, reported, to, him, that, the, oracle, said, there, is, no, wiser, man, socrates, interpreted, that, divine, report, as, a, riddle, because, he, was, aware, of, possessing, no, wisdom, great, or, small, and, that, lying, is, not, in, the, nature, of, the, gods, socrates, then, sought, to, solve, the, divine, paradox, how, an, ignorant, man, also, could, be, the, wisest, of, all, men, in, effort, to, illuminate, the, meaning, of, the, oracles, categorical, statement, that, he, is, the, wisest, man, in, the, land, after, systematically, interrogating, the, politicians, the, poets, and, the, craftsmen, socrates, determined, that, the, politicians, were, not, wise, like, he, was, he, says, of, himself, in, reference, to, a, politician, i, am, wiser, than, this, man, it, is, likely, that, neither, of, us, knows, anything, worthwhile, but, he, thinks, he, knows, something, when, he, does, not, 21d, socrates, says, that, the, poets, did, not, understand, their, poetry, that, the, prophets, and, seers, did, not, understand, what, they, said, and, that, the, craftsmen, while, knowing, many, things, thought, they, also, had, much, knowledge, on, things, of, which, they, had, none, in, that, light, socrates, saw, himself, as, a, spokesman, for, the, oracle, at, delphi, 22e, he, asked, himself, if, he, would, rather, be, an, impostor, like, the, wise, people, he, interrogated, or, if, he, would, rather, be, himself, socrates, of, athens, socrates, tells, the, jury, that, he, would, rather, be, himself, than, be, anyone, else, he, says, that, in, searching, for, a, man, wiser, than, himself, he, came, to, be, regarded, as, a, social, gadfly, and, acquired, a, bad, reputation, among, athens, politically, powerful, personages, having, addressed, the, social, prejudices, against, him, socrates, addresses, the, first, accusation, the, moral, corruption, of, athenian, youth, by, accusing, his, accuser, meletus, of, being, indifferent, to, the, persons, and, things, about, which, he, professes, to, care, whilst, interrogating, meletus, socrates, says, that, no, one, would, intentionally, corrupt, another, person, because, the, corrupter, later, stands, to, be, harmed, in, vengeance, by, the, corrupted, person, the, matter, of, moral, corruption, is, important, for, two, reasons, i, the, accusation, is, that, socrates, corrupted, the, rich, young, men, of, athens, by, teaching, atheism, ii, that, if, he, is, convicted, of, corruption, it, will, be, because, the, playwright, aristophanes, already, had, corrupted, the, minds, of, his, audience, when, they, were, young, by, lampooning, socrates, as, the, sophistical, philosopher, in, the, clouds, a, comic, play, produced, about, twenty, four, years, earlier, socrates, then, addresses, the, second, accusation, asebeia, impiety, against, the, pantheon, of, athens, by, which, meletus, says, that, socrates, is, an, atheist, in, cross, examination, socrates, leads, meletus, to, contradict, himself, that, socrates, is, an, atheist, who, also, believes, in, spiritual, agencies, and, demigods, socrates, tells, the, judges, that, meletus, has, contradicted, himself, and, then, asks, if, meletus, has, designed, a, test, of, intelligence, for, identifying, logical, contradictions, on, death, socrates, proceeds, to, say, that, people, who, fear, death, are, showing, their, ignorance, because, death, might, be, a, good, thing, yet, people, fear, it, as, if, it, is, evil, even, though, they, cannot, know, whether, it, is, good, or, evil, socrates, says, that, his, wisdom, is, in, being, aware, that, he, is, ignorant, on, this, and, other, topics, regarding, a, citizen, s, obedience, to, authority, socrates, says, that, a, lawful, authority, either, human, or, divine, should, always, be, obeyed, in, a, conflict, of, obedience, to, such, authorities, he, thinks, that, obeying, divine, authority, supersedes, obeying, human, authority, gentlemen, i, am, your, grateful, and, devoted, servant, but, i, owe, a, greater, obedience, to, the, god, than, to, you, and, as, long, as, i, draw, breath, and, have, my, faculties, i, shall, never, stop, practising, philosophy, 29d, as, a, spokesman, for, the, oracle, at, delphi, he, is, to, spur, the, athenians, to, greater, awareness, of, ethics, and, moral, conduct, and, always, shall, question, and, argue, therefore, the, philosopher, socrates, of, athens, asks, his, fellow, citizens, are, you, not, ashamed, that, you, give, your, attention, to, acquiring, as, much, money, as, possible, and, similarly, with, reputation, and, honour, and, give, no, attention, or, thought, to, truth, and, understanding, and, the, perfection, of, your, soul, 29e, granting, no, concession, to, his, precarious, legal, situation, socrates, speaks, emotionally, and, provocatively, to, the, court, and, says, that, the, greatest, good, to, occur, upon, athens, is, his, moral, concern, for, them, as, fellow, citizens, he, thinks, that, material, wealth, is, a, consequence, of, goodness, that, the, god, does, not, permit, a, better, man, to, be, harmed, by, a, lesser, man, and, that, he, is, the, social, gadfly, required, by, athens, all, day, long, i, will, never, cease, to, settle, here, there, and, everywhere, rousing, persuading, and, reproving, every, one, of, you, in, support, of, the, moral, mission, assigned, him, by, the, oracle, at, delphi, socrates, tells, the, court, that, his, daimonion, continually, forbids, him, to, act, unethically, implicitly, validating, meletus, accusation, that, socrates, believes, in, novel, deities, not, of, the, athenian, pantheon, socrates, says, he, never, was, a, paid, teacher, therefore, he, is, not, responsible, for, the, corruption, of, any, athenian, citizen, if, he, had, corrupted, anyone, he, asks, why, have, they, not, come, forward, to, bear, witness, if, the, corrupted, athenians, are, ignorant, of, having, been, corrupted, then, why, have, their, families, not, spoken, on, their, behalf, socrates, indicates, in, point, of, fact, relatives, of, the, athenian, youth, he, supposedly, corrupted, are, present, in, court, giving, him, moral, support, socrates, concludes, his, legal, defence, by, reminding, the, judges, that, he, shall, not, resort, to, emotive, tricks, and, arguments, shall, not, cry, in, public, regret, and, that, his, three, sons, will, not, appear, in, court, to, pathetically, sway, the, judges, socrates, says, he, is, not, afraid, of, death, and, shall, not, act, contrary, to, religious, duty, he, says, he, will, rely, solely, upon, sound, argument, and, truth, to, present, his, case, at, trial, rhetoric, in, plato, s, version, of, the, trial, socrates, mocks, oratory, as, a, deceitful, rhetorical, practice, designed, to, lead, jurors, away, from, the, truth, some, scholarship, however, views, this, mockery, only, as, a, critique, of, narrow, views, of, rhetoric, as, speechmaking, and, in, turn, sees, the, whole, trial, as, an, implicit, depiction, of, a, more, expansive, view, of, rhetoric, that, unfolds, over, the, course, of, a, lifetime, the, jurors, of, the, trial, voted, the, guilt, of, socrates, by, a, relatively, narrow, margin, 36a, in, the, apology, of, socrates, plato, cites, no, total, numbers, of, votes, condemning, or, acquitting, the, philosopher, of, the, accusations, of, moral, corruption, and, impiety, socrates, says, that, he, would, have, been, acquitted, if, thirty, more, jurors, had, voted, in, his, favour, this, would, likely, mean, that, if, the, court, were, composed, of, 500, people, then, 280, voted, against, socrates, and, 220, voted, in, his, favor, this, would, make, the, margin, about, 12, percent, in, such, cases, where, the, penalty, of, death, might, arise, as, a, legal, sanction, for, the, accusations, is, presented, athenian, law, required, that, the, prosecutor, and, the, defendant, each, propose, an, administrative, penalty, to, punish, the, actions, reported, in, the, accusations, socrates, antagonises, the, court, by, proposing, rather, than, a, penalty, a, reward, perpetual, maintenance, at, public, expense, he, notes, that, the, vote, of, judgement, against, him, was, close, in, that, vein, socrates, then, engages, in, dark, humour, suggesting, that, meletus, narrowly, escaped, a, great, fine, for, not, meeting, the, statutory, requirement, of, receiving, one, fifth, of, the, votes, of, the, assembled, judges, in, favour, of, his, accusations, against, socrates, in, that, way, socrates, published, the, financial, consequence, for, meletus, to, consider, as, a, plaintiff, in, a, lawsuit, because, the, athenian, legal, system, discouraged, frivolous, lawsuits, by, imposing, a, financially, onerous, fine, upon, the, plaintiff, if, the, vote, of, the, judges, was, less, than, one, fifth, of, the, number, of, judges, required, by, the, type, of, lawsuit, as, punishment, for, the, two, accusations, formally, presented, against, him, at, trial, socrates, proposed, to, the, court, that, he, be, treated, as, a, benefactor, to, the, city, of, athens, that, he, should, be, given, free, meals, in, perpetuity, at, the, prytaneum, the, public, dining, hall, of, athens, receiving, such, public, largesse, is, an, honour, reserved, for, olympic, athletes, prominent, citizens, and, benefactors, of, athens, as, a, city, and, as, a, state, finally, after, the, court, dismisses, the, proposed, reward, free, meals, at, the, prytaneum, socrates, considers, imprisonment, and, banishment, before, settling, upon, a, punishment, fine, of, 100, drachmae, despite, his, poverty, this, was, a, minor, punishment, compared, to, the, death, penalty, proposed, by, the, prosecutors, and, encouraged, by, the, judges, of, the, trial, his, supporters, plato, crito, critobulus, and, apollodorus, offered, even, more, money, to, pay, as, a, fine, 3, 000, drachmae, thirty, minae, nonetheless, to, the, judges, of, the, trial, of, socrates, a, pecuniary, fine, was, insufficient, punishment, in, the, trial, of, socrates, the, judgement, of, the, court, was, death, for, socrates, most, of, the, jurors, voted, for, the, death, penalty, apology, 38c, yet, plato, provides, no, jury, vote, numbers, in, the, text, of, the, apology, of, socrates, but, diogenes, la, rtius, reports, that, 280, jurors, voted, for, the, death, penalty, and, 220, jurors, voted, for, a, pecuniary, fine, for, socrates, 2, 42, moreover, the, politically, provocative, language, and, irreverent, tone, of, socrates, s, self, defence, speech, angered, the, jurors, and, invited, their, punishment, of, him, socrates, responds, to, the, death, penalty, verdict, by, first, addressing, the, jurors, who, voted, for, his, death, he, says, that, instead, of, waiting, a, short, time, for, him, to, die, from, old, age, they, will, now, have, to, accept, the, harsh, criticisms, from, his, supporters, he, prophesied, that, his, death, will, cause, the, youngsters, to, come, forward, and, replace, him, as, a, social, gadfly, spurring, ethical, conduct, from, the, citizens, of, athens, in, a, manner, more, vexing, than, him, 39d, to, the, jurors, who, voted, to, acquit, him, socrates, gives, encouragement, his, supernatural, daimonion, did, not, interfere, with, his, conduct, of, the, legal, defence, which, he, viewed, as, a, sign, that, such, a, defence, was, the, correct, action, in, that, way, the, daimonion, communicated, to, socrates, that, death, might, be, a, good, thing, either, death, is, annihilation, release, from, earthly, worry, and, not, to, be, feared, or, death, is, migration, to, a, higher, plane, of, existence, in, which, reside, the, souls, of, personages, and, heroes, such, as, hesiod, and, homer, and, odysseus, socrates, concludes, his, self, defence, by, saying, to, the, court, that, he, bears, no, ill, will, neither, towards, his, accusers, lycon, anytus, and, meletus, nor, the, jurors, he, then, asks, the, athenians, to, correct, his, three, sons, if, they, value, material, wealth, more, than, living, virtuously, or, if, they, become, too, prideful, and, in, doing, that, justice, will, finally, be, served
