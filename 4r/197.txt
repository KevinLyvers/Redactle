the, march, sisters, little, men, 1871, and, jo, s, boys, 1886, the, novel, has, been, said, to, address, three, major, themes, domesticity, work, and, true, love, all, of, them, interdependent, and, each, necessary, to, the, achievement, of, its, heroine, s, individual, identity, 200, according, to, sarah, elbert, alcott, created, a, new, form, of, literature, one, that, took, elements, from, romantic, children, s, fiction, and, combined, it, with, others, from, sentimental, novels, resulting, in, a, totally, new, genre, elbert, argues, that, within, little, women, can, be, found, the, first, vision, of, the, all, american, girl, and, that, her, various, aspects, are, embodied, in, the, differing, march, sisters, 199, the, book, has, been, translated, into, numerous, languages, and, frequently, adapted, for, stage, and, screen, in, 1868, alcott, s, publisher, thomas, niles, recommended, that, she, write, a, novel, about, girls, that, would, have, widespread, appeal, 2, alcott, resisted, preferring, to, publish, a, collection, of, short, stories, instead, niles, pressed, her, to, write, the, girls, book, first, however, and, he, was, aided, by, her, father, amos, bronson, alcott, who, also, urged, her, to, do, so, 207, louisa, confided, to, a, friend, i, could, not, write, a, girls, story, knowing, little, about, any, but, my, own, sisters, and, always, preferring, boys, in, may, 1868, alcott, wrote, in, her, journal, niles, partner, of, roberts, asked, me, to, write, a, girl, s, book, i, said, i, d, try, 36, alcott, set, her, novel, in, an, imaginary, orchard, house, modeled, on, her, own, residence, of, the, same, name, where, she, wrote, the, novel, xiii, she, later, recalled, that, she, did, not, think, she, could, write, a, successful, book, for, girls, and, did, not, enjoy, writing, it, 335, i, plod, away, she, wrote, in, her, diary, although, i, don, t, enjoy, this, sort, of, things, 37, by, june, alcott, had, sent, the, first, dozen, chapters, to, niles, and, both, agreed, that, they, were, dull, but, niles, s, niece, lillie, almy, read, them, and, said, she, enjoyed, them, 335, 336, the, completed, manuscript, was, shown, to, several, girls, who, agreed, it, was, splendid, alcott, wrote, they, are, the, best, critics, so, i, should, definitely, be, satisfied, 37, she, wrote, little, women, in, record, time, for, money, 196x2, but, the, book, s, immediate, success, surprised, both, her, and, her, publisher, according, to, literary, critic, sarah, elbert, when, using, the, term, little, women, alcott, was, drawing, on, its, dickensian, meaning, it, represented, the, period, in, a, young, woman, s, life, where, childhood, and, elder, childhood, are, overlapping, with, young, womanhood, each, of, the, march, sister, heroines, has, a, harrowing, experience, that, alerts, them, and, the, reader, that, childhood, innocence, is, of, the, past, and, that, the, inescapable, woman, problem, is, all, that, remains, the,

brown, hair, and, blue, eyes, and, particularly, beautiful, hands, and, she, is, seen, as, the, prettiest, one, of, the, sisters, meg, fulfils, expectations, for, women, of, the, time, from, the, start, she, is, already, a, nearly, perfect, little, woman, in, the, eyes, of, the, world, before, her, marriage, to, john, brooke, while, still, living, at, home, she, often, lectures, her, younger, sisters, to, ensure, they, grow, to, embody, the, title, of, little, women, meg, is, employed, as, a, governess, for, the, kings, a, wealthy, local, family, because, of, their, father, s, family, s,

at, the, beginning, of, the, final, book, according, to, sarah, elbert, democratic, domesticity, requires, maturity, strength, and, above, all, a, secure, identity, that, meg, lacks, 204, others, believe, alcott, does, not, intend, to, belittle, meg, for, her, ordinary, life, and, writes, her, with, loving, detail, suffused, with, sentimentality, the, principal, character, jo, 15, years, old, at, the, beginning, of, the, book, is, a, strong, and, willful, young, woman, struggling, to, subdue, her, fiery, temper, and, stubborn, personality, second, oldest, of, the, four, sisters, jo, is, masculine, the, smartest, most, creative, one, in, the, family, her, father, has, referred, to, her, as, his, son, jo, and, her, best, friend, and, neighbour, theodore, laurie, laurence, sometimes, calls, her, my, dear, fellow, while, she, alone, calls, him, teddy, jo, has, a, hot, temper, that, often, leads, her, into, trouble, with, the, help, of, her, own, misguided, sense, of, humor, her, sister, beth, and, her, mother, she, works, on, controlling, it, it, has, been, said, that, much, of, louisa, may, alcott, shows, through, in, these, characteristics, of, jo, in, her, essay, recollections, of, my, childhood, alcott, refers, to, herself, as, a, tomboy, who, enjoyed, boys, activities, like, running, foot, races, and, climbing, trees, jo, loves, literature, both, reading, and, writing, she, composes, plays, for, her, sisters, to, perform, and, writes, short, stories, she, initially, rejects, the, idea, of, marriage, and, romance, feeling, that, it, would, break, up, her, family, and, separate, her, from, the, sisters, whom, she, adores, while, pursuing, a, literary, career, in, new, york, city, she, meets, friedrich, bhaer, a, german, professor, on, her, return, home, laurie, proposes, marriage, to, jo, which, she, rejects, thus, confirming, her, independence, another, reason, for, the, rejection, is, that, the, love, that, laurie, has, for, jo, is, more, a, brotherly, love, rather, than, romantic, love, the, difference, between, which, he, was, unable, to, understand, because, he, was, just, a, boy, as, said, by, alcott, in, the, book, after, beth, dies, professor, bhaer, woos, jo, at, her, home, when, they, decide, to, share, life, s, burdens, just, as, they, shared, the, load, of, bundles, on, their, shopping, expedition, 210, she, is, 25, years, old, when, she, accepts, his, proposal, the, marriage, is, deferred, until, her, unexpected, inheritance, of, her, aunt, march, s, home, a, year, later, according, to, critic, barbara, sicherman, the, crucial, first, point, is, that, the, choice, is, hers, its, quirkiness, another, sign, of, her, much, prized, individuality, 21, they, have, two, sons, robert, rob, bhaer, and, theodore, ted, bhaer, jo, also, writes, the, first, part, of, little, women, during, the, second, portion, of, the, novel, according, to, elbert, her, narration, signals, a, successfully, completed, adolescence, 199, beth, 13, when, the, story, starts, is, described, as, kind, gentle, sweet, shy, quiet, honest, and, musical, she, is, the, shyest, march, sister, and, the, pianist, of, the, family, 53, infused, with, quiet, wisdom, she, is, the, peacemaker, of, the, family, and, she, gently, scolds, her, sisters, when, they, argue, as, her, sisters, grow, up, they, begin, to, leave, home, but, beth, has, no, desire, to, leave, her, house, or, family, she, is, especially, close, to, jo, when, beth, develops, scarlet, fever, after, visiting, the, hummels, jo, does, most, of, the, nursing, and, rarely, leaves, her, side, beth, recovers, from, the, acute, disease, but, her, health, is, permanently, weakened, as, she, grows, beth, begins, to, realize, that, her, time, with, her, loved, ones, is, coming, to, an, end, finally, the, family, accepts, that, beth, will, not, live, much, longer, they, make, a, special, room, for, her, filled, with, all, the, things, she, loves, best, her, kittens, her, piano, father, s, books, amy, s, sketches, and, her, beloved, dolls, she, is, never, idle, she, knits, and, sews, things, for, the, children, who, pass, by, on, their, way, to, and, from, school, but, eventually, she, puts, down, her, sewing, needle, saying, it, grew, heavy, beth, s, final, sickness, has, a, strong, effect, on, her, sisters, especially, jo, who, resolves, to, live, her, life, with, more, consideration, and, care, for, everyone, the, main, loss, during, little, women, is, the, death, of, beloved, beth, her, self, sacrifice, is, ultimately, the, greatest, in, the, novel, she, gives, up, her, life, knowing, that, it, has, had, only, private, domestic, meaning, 206, 207, amy, is, the, youngest, sister, and, baby, of, the, family, she, s, 12, when, the, story, begins, interested, in, art, she, is, described, as, a, regular, snow, maiden, with, curly, golden, hair, and, blue, eyes, pale, and, slender, and, always, carrying, herself, like, a, proper, young, lady, she, is, the, artist, of, the, family, often, coddled, because, she, is, the, youngest, amy, can, behave, in, a, vain, and, self, centered, way, though, she, does, still, love, her, family, 5, she, has, the, middle, name, curtis, and, is, the, only, march, sister, to, use, her, full, name, rather, than, a, diminutive, amy, is, chosen, by, her, aunt, to, travel, to, europe, with, her, instead, of, her, sister, jo, there, she, matures, and, makes, a, decision, based, on, her, limited, artistic, talent, how, to, direct, her, adult, life, she, encounters, laurie, laurence, and, his, grandfather, during, the, extended, visit, amy, is, the, least, inclined, of, the, sisters, to, sacrifice, and, self, denial, she, behaves, well, in, upper, class, society, and, she, is, at, ease, with, herself, critic, martha, saxton, observes, the, author, was, never, fully, at, ease, with, amy, s, moral, development, and, her, success, in, life, seemed, relatively, accidental, however, amy, s, morality, does, appear, to, develop, throughout, her, adolescence, and, early, adulthood, and, she, can, confidently, and, justly, put, laurie, in, his, place, when, she, believes, he, is, wasting, his, life, on, pleasurable, activities, ultimately, amy, is, shown, to, work, very, hard, to, gain, what, she, wants, and, to, make, the, most, of, her, success, when, she, has, it, for, her, books, alcott, was, often, inspired, by, familiar, elements, the, characters, in, little, women, are, recognizably, drawn, from, family, members, and, friends, 202, her, married, sister, anna, was, meg, the, family, beauty, lizzie, alcott, s, beloved, sister, was, the, model, for, beth, like, beth, lizzie, was, quiet, and, retiring, like, beth, as, well, she, died, tragically, at, age, twenty, three, from, the, lingering, effects, of, scarlet, fever, may, alcott, s, strong, willed, sister, was, portrayed, as, amy, whose, pretentious, affectations, cause, her, occasional, downfalls, 202, alcott, portrayed, herself, as, jo, alcott, readily, corresponded, with, readers, who, addressed, her, as, miss, march, or, jo, and, she, did, not, correct, them, 31, however, alcott, s, portrayal, even, if, inspired, by, her, family, is, an, idealized, one, for, instance, mr, march, is, portrayed, as, a, hero, of, the, american, civil, war, a, gainfully, employed, chaplain, and, presumably, a, source, of, inspiration, to, the, women, of, the, family, he, is, absent, for, most, of, the, novel, 51, in, contrast, bronson, alcott, was, very, present, in, his, family, s, household, due, in, part, to, his, inability, to, find, steady, work, while, he, espoused, many, of, the, educational, principles, touted, by, the, march, family, he, was, loud, and, dictatorial, his, lack, of, financial, independence, was, a, source, of, humiliation, to, his, wife, and, daughters, 51, the, march, family, is, portrayed, as, living, in, genteel, penury, but, the, alcott, family, dependent, on, an, improvident, impractical, father, suffered, real, poverty, and, occasional, hunger, in, addition, to, her, own, childhood, and, that, of, her, sisters, scholars, who, have, examined, the, diaries, of, louisa, alcott, s, mother, abigail, alcott, have, surmised, that, little, women, was, also, heavily, inspired, by, abigail, alcott, s, own, early, life, 6, originally, alcott, did, not, want, to, publish, little, women, claiming, she, found, it, boring, and, wasn, t, sure, how, to, write, girls, as, she, knew, few, beyond, her, sisters, however, encouraged, by, her, editor, thomas, niles, she, wrote, it, within, 10, weeks, also, little, women, has, several, textual, and, structural, references, to, john, bunyan, s, novel, the, pilgrim, s, progress, jo, and, her, sisters, read, it, at, the, outset, of, the, book, and, try, to, follow, the, good, example, of, bunyan, s, christian, throughout, the, novel, the, main, characters, refer, many, times, to, the, pilgrim, s, progress, and, liken, the, events, in, their, own, lives, to, the, experiences, of, the, pilgrims, several, chapter, titles, directly, reference, characters, and, places, from, the, pilgrim, s, progress, in, addition, to, drawing, on, her, own, life, during, the, development, of, little, women, alcott, also, took, influence, from, several, of, her, earlier, works, including, the, sisters, trial, a, modern, cinderella, and, in, the, garret, the, characters, within, these, short, stories, and, poems, in, addition, to, alcott, s, own, family, and, personal, relationships, inspired, the, general, concepts, and, bases, for, many, of, the, characters, in, little, women, the, first, volume, of, little, women, was, published, in, 1868, by, roberts, brothers, the, first, edition, included, illustrations, by, abigail, may, alcott, the, sister, commonly, called, may, who, inspired, the, fictional, amy, march, she, struggled, with, her, illustrative, additions, to, her, sister, s, book, but, later, improved, her, skills, and, found, some, success, as, an, artist, the, first, printing, of, 2, 000, copies, sold, out, quickly, and, the, company, had, trouble, keeping, up, with, the, demand, for, additional, printings, they, announced, the, great, literary, hit, of, the, season, is, undoubtedly, miss, alcott, s, little, women, the, orders, for, which, continue, to, flow, in, upon, us, to, such, an, extent, as, to, make, it, impossible, to, answer, them, with, promptness, 37, the, last, line, of, chapter, 23, in, the, first, volume, states, so, the, curtain, falls, upon, meg, jo, beth, and, amy, whether, it, ever, rises, again, depends, upon, the, reception, given, the, first, act, of, the, domestic, drama, called, little, women, alcott, delivered, the, manuscript, for, the, second, volume,

a, title, as, well, part, 2, chapter, 24, opens, with, in, order, that, we, may, start, afresh, and, go, to, meg, s, wedding, with, free, minds, it, will, be, well, to, begin, with, a, little, gossip,

and, that, fritz, s, proposal, to, jo, and, her, acceptance, is, one, of, the, really, human, things, in, human, literature, gregory, s, jackson, said, that, alcott, s, use, of, realism, belongs, to, the, american, protestant, pedagogical, tradition, which, includes, a, range, of, religious, literary, traditions, with, which, alcott, was, familiar, he, has, copies, in, his, book, of, nineteenth, century, images, of, devotional, children, s, guides, which, provide, background, for, the, game, of, pilgrims, progress, that, alcott, uses, in, her, plot, of, book, one, little, women, was, well, received, upon, first, publication, according, to, 21st, century, critic, barbara, sicherman, there, was, during, the, 19th, century, a, scarcity, of, models, for, nontraditional, womanhood, which, led, more, women, to, look, toward, literature, for, self, authorization, this, is, especially, true, during, adolescence, 2, little, women, became, the, paradigmatic, text, for, young, women, of, the, era, and, one, in, which, family, literary, culture, is, prominently, featured, 3, adult, elements, of, women, s, fiction, in, little, women, included, a, change, of, heart, necessary, for, the, female, protagonist, to, evolve, in, the, story, 199, in, the, late, 20th, century, some, scholars, criticized, the, novel, sarah, elbert, for, instance, wrote, that, little, women, was, the, beginning, of, a, decline, in, the, radical, power, of, women, s, fiction, partly, because, women, s, fiction, was, being, idealized, with, a, hearth, and, home, children, s, story, 197, women, s, literature, historians, and, juvenile, fiction, historians, have, agreed, that, little, women, was, the, beginning, of, this, downward, spiral, but, elbert, says, that, little, women, did, not, belittle, women, s, fiction, and, that, alcott, stayed, true, to, her, romantic, birthright, 198, 199, little, women, s, popular, audience, was, responsive, to, ideas, of, social, change, as, they, were, shown, within, the, familiar, construct, of, domesticity, 220, while, alcott, had, been, commissioned, to, write, a, story, for, girls, her, primary, heroine, jo, march, became, a, favorite, of, many, different, women, including, educated, women, writers, through, the, 20th, century, the, girl, story, became, a, new, publishing, category, with, a, domestic, focus, that, paralleled, boys, adventure, stories, 3, 4, one, reason, the, novel, was, so, popular, was, that, it, appealed, to, different, classes, of, women, along, with, those, of, different, national, backgrounds, at, a, time, of, high, immigration, to, the, united, states, through, the, march, sisters, women, could, relate, and, dream, where, they, may, not, have, before, 3, 4, both, the, passion, little, women, has, engendered, in, diverse, readers, and, its, ability, to, survive, its, era, and, transcend, its, genre, point, to, a, text, of, unusual, permeability, 35, at, the, time, young, girls, perceived, that, marriage, was, their, end, goal, after, the, publication, of, the, first, volume, many, girls, wrote, to, alcott, asking, her, who, the, little, women, marry, 21, sicherman, said, that, the, ending, which, she, personally, characterizes, as, unsatisfying, worked, to, keep, the, story, alive, as, if, the, reader, might, find, it, ended, differently, upon, different, readings, 21, anne, e, boyd, contends, that, alcott, particularly, battled, the, conventional, marriage, plot, in, writing, little, women, alcott, did, not, have, jo, accept, laurie, s, hand, in, marriage, rather, when, she, arranged, for, jo, to, marry, she, portrayed, an, unconventional, man, as, her, husband, in, sicherman, s, opinion, alcott, used, friedrich, to, subvert, adolescent, romantic, ideals, because, he, was, much, older, and, seemingly, unsuited, for, jo, 21, however, the, character, was, partially, based, upon, older, men, alcott, was, attracted, to, such, as, henry, david, thoreau, and, ralph, waldo, emerson, or, admired, such, as, german, writers, charles, follen, and, johann, wolfgang, von, goethe, in, particular, alcott, had, considered, goethe, her, chief, idol, since, the, day, emerson, had, introduced, her, to, goethe, and, handed, her, a, copy, of, wilhelm, meister, s, apprenticeship, bhaer, is, also, representative, of, alcott, s, reverence, for, german, culture, in, 2003, little, women, was, ranked, number, 18, in, the, big, read, a, survey, of, the, british, public, by, the, bbc, to, determine, the, nation, s, best, loved, novel, not, children, s, novel, it, is, fourth, highest, among, novels, published, in, the, u, s, on, that, list, based, on, a, 2007, online, poll, the, u, s, national, education, association, listed, it, as, one, of, its, teachers, top,

audience, little, women, has, been, one, of, the, most, widely, read, novels, noted, by, stern, from, a, 1927, report, in, the, new, york, times, and, cited, in, little, women, and, the, feminist, imagination, criticism, controversy, personal, essays, ruth, macdonald, argued, that, louisa, may, alcott, stands, as, one, of, the, great, american, practitioners, of, the, girls, novel, and, the, family, story, in, the, 1860s, gendered, separation, of, children, s, fiction, was, a, newer, division, in, literature, this, division, signaled, a, beginning, of, polarization, of, gender, roles, as, social, constructs, as, class, stratification, increased, 18, joy, kasson, wrote, alcott, chronicled, the, coming, of, age, of, young, girls, their, struggles, with, issues, such, as, selfishness, and, generosity, the, nature, of, individual, integrity, and, above, all, the, question, of, their, place, in, the, world, around, them, girls, related, to, the, march, sisters, in, little, women, along, with, following, the, lead, of, their, heroines, by, assimilating, aspects, of, the, story, into, their, own, lives, 22, after, reading, little, women, some, women, felt, the, need, to, acquire, new, and, more, public, identities, however, dependent, on, other, factors, such, as, financial, resources, 55, while, little, women, showed, the, regular, lives, of, american, middle, class, girls, it, also, legitimized, their, dreams, to, do, something, different, and, allowed, them, to, consider, the, possibilities, 36, more, young, women, started, writing, stories, that, had, adventurous, plots, and, stories, of, individual, achievement, traditionally, coded, male, challenged, women, s, socialization, into, domesticity, 55, little, women, also, influenced, contemporary, european, immigrants, to, the, united, states, who, wanted, to, assimilate, into, the, middle, class, culture, in, the, pages, of, little, women, young, and, adolescent, girls, read, the, normalization, of, ambitious, women, this, provided, an, alternative, to, the, previously, normalized, gender, roles, 35, little, women, repeatedly, reinforced, the, importance, of, individuality, and, female, vocation, 26, little, women, had, continued, relevance, of, its, subject, and, its, longevity, points, as, well, to, surprising, continuities, in, gender, norms, from, the, 1860s, at, least, through, the, 1960s, 35, those, interested, in, domestic, reform, could, look, to, the, pages, of, little, women, to, see, how, a, democratic, household, would, operate, 276, while, alcott, never, questioned, the, value, of, domesticity, she, challenged, the, social, constructs, that, made, spinsters, obscure, and, fringe, members, of, society, solely, because, they, were, not, married, 193, little, women, indisputably, enlarges, the, myth, of, american, womanhood, by, insisting, that, the, home, and, the, women, s, sphere, cherish, individuality, and, thus, produce, young, adults, who, can, make, their, way, in, the, world, while, preserving, a, critical, distance, from, its, social, arrangements, as, with, all, youth, the, march, girls, had, to, grow, up, these, sisters, and, in, particular, jo, were, apprehensive, about, adulthood, because, they, were, afraid, that, by, conforming, to, what, society, wanted, they, would, lose, their, special, individuality, 199, alcott, s, jo, also, made, professional, writing, imaginable, for, generations, of, women, writers, as, diverse, as, maxine, hong, kingston, margaret, atwood, and, j, k, rowling, have, noted, the, influence, of, jo, march, on, their, artistic, development, even, other, fictional, portraits, of, young, women, aspiring, to, authorship, often, reference, jo, march, alcott, s, novel, is, often, celebrated, for, jo, and, her, narrative, arch, in, which, she, becomes, a, self, determined, woman, with, a, career, however, framing, this, novel, as, a, success, solely, for, jo, s, accomplishments, portrays, it, as, a, traditional, lone, genius, patriarchal, narrative, in, which, only, women, who, are, categorized, as, exceptional, or, particularly, worthy, are, celebrated, little, women, awards, all, its, women, worthy, despite, their, status, as, conventional, or, unconventional, not, just, jo, who, is, the, obvious, exception, to, societal, expectation, alcott, s, novel, celebrates, the, agency, of, women, the, four, sisters, and, their, mother, to, choose, their, path, in, life, meg, makes, the, decision, to, marry, and, have, children, and, though, it, is, the, traditional, pathway, she, makes, the, choice, for, her, own, happiness, thus, reducing, alcott, s, novel, to, just, jo, s, experience, as, an, exception, promotes, it, as, a, patriarchal, narrative, and, erases, her, careful, work, to, portray, a, matriarchal, narrative, rich, with, female, agency, and, voice, alcott, made, women, s, rights, integral, to, her, stories, and, above, all, to, little, women, 193, alcott, s, fiction, became, her, most, important, feminist, contribution, even, considering, all, the, effort, alcott, made, to, help, facilitate, women, s, rights, 193, she, thought, that, a, democratic, household, could, evolve, into, a, feminist, society, in, little, women, she, imagined, that, just, such, an, evolution, might, begin, with, plumfield, a, nineteenth, century, feminist, utopia, 194, little, women, has, a, timeless, resonance, which, reflects, alcott, s, grasp, of, her, historical, framework, in, the, 1860s, the, novel, s, ideas, do, not, intrude, themselves, upon, the, reader, because, the, author, is, wholly, in, control, of, the, implications, of, her, imaginative, structure, sexual, equality, is, the, salvation, of, marriage, and, the, family, democratic, relationships, make, happy, endings, this, is, the, unifying, imaginative, frame, of, little, women, 276, little, women, has, been, adapted, to, film, seven, times, the, first, adaptation, was, a, silent, film,
