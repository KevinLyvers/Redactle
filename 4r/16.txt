indian, architecture, is, rooted, in, the, history, culture, and, religion, of, india, among, several, architectural, styles, and, traditions, the, best, known, include, the, many, varieties, of, hindu, temple, architecture, and, indo, islamic, architecture, especially, rajput, architecture, mughal, architecture, south, indian, architecture, and, indo, saracenic, architecture, early, indian, architecture, was, made, from, wood, which, did, not, survive, due, to, rotting, and, instability, in, the, structures, instead, the, earliest, existing, architecture, are, made, with, indian, rock, cut, architecture, including, many, buddhist, hindu, and, jain, temples, the, hindu, temple, architecture, is, divided, into, the, dravidian, style, of, southern, india, and, the, nagara, style, of, northern, india, with, other, regional, styles, housing, styles, also, vary, between, regions, depending, on, climate, the, first, major, islamic, kingdom, in, india, was, the, delhi, sultanate, which, led, to, the, development, of, indo, islamic, architecture, combining, indian, and, islamic, features, the, rule, of, the, mughal, empire, when, mughal, architecture, evolved, is, regarded, as, the, zenith, of, indo, islamic, architecture, with, the, taj, mahal, being, the, high, point, of, their, contribution, indo, islamic, architecture, influenced, the, rajput, and, sikh, styles, as, well, during, the, british, colonial, period, european, styles, including, neoclassical, gothic, revival, and, baroque, became, prevalent, across, india, the, amalgamation, of, indo, islamic, and, european, styles, led, to, a, new, style, known, as, the, indo, saracenic, style, after, india, s, independence, modernist, ideas, spread, among, indian, architects, as, a, way, of, progressing, from, the, colonial, culture, le, corbusier, who, designed, the, city, of, chandigarh, influenced, a, generation, of, architects, towards, modernism, in, the, 20th, century, the, economic, reforms, of, 1991, further, bolstered, the, urban, architecture, of, india, as, the, country, became, more, integrated, with, the, world, s, economy, traditional, vastu, shastra, remains, influential, in, india, s, architecture, in, the, contemporary, era, in, south, india, the, neolithic, began, in, 6500, bce, and, lasted, till, around, 1400, bce, when, the, megalithic, transition, period, began, the, south, indian, neolithic, period, is, characterized, by, ash, mounds, from, 2500, bce, in, the, region, of, karnataka, which, later, expanded, into, tamil, nadu, neolithic, settlements, have, been, found, in, the, northwest, kashmir, east, bihar, and, odisha, south, karnataka, tamil, nadu, and, andhra, pradesh, and, the, northeastern, frontier, meghalaya, of, india, the, earliest, clear, evidence, of, the, megalithic, urn, burials, discovered, at, various, places, in, tamil, nadu, date, back, to, 1000, bce, the, most, notable, megalithic, urn, was, discovered, in, adichanallur, 24, kilometres, 15, mi, from, tirunelveli, where, archaeologists, from, the, archaeological, survey, of, india, unearthed, 12, urns, containing, human, skulls, skeletons, and, bones, husks, grains, of, charred, rice, and, neolithic, celts, confirming, the, presence, of, the, neolithic, period, 2800, years, ago, the, unearthed, local, and, foreign, antiquities, of, art, architecture, customs, and, rituals, depicted, by, the, engravings, on, pottery, and, other, artifacts, indicate, that, the, prehistoric, people, of, the, burzahom, established, contact, with, central, asia, and, south, west, asia, and, had, links, to, the, gangetic, plains, and, peninsular, india, megalithic, burial, sites, have, been, found, scattered, all, over, the, subcontinent, the, neolithic, period, lasted, up, until, 3300, bce, overlapping, with, the, following, early, harappan, chalcolithic, to, early, bronze, age, period, one, of, the, earliest, neolithic, sites, in, india, is, lahuradewa, in, the, middle, ganga, region, and, jhusi, near, the, confluence, of, the, ganga, and, yamuna, rivers, both, dating, to, around, the, 7th, millennium, bce, the, indus, valley, civilization, covered, a, large, area, around, and, beyond, the, indus, river, basin, in, the, late, bronze, age, of, india, in, its, mature, phase, from, about, 2600, to, 1900, bce, the, civilization, developed, several, cities, marked, by, great, uniformity, within, and, between, sites, including, harappa, lothal, and, the, unesco, world, heritage, site, mohenjo, daro, the, civic, and, town, planning, and, the, engineering, of, these, cities, are, deemed, remarkable, but, the, building, designs, are, of, a, startling, utilitarian, character, there, are, granaries, drains, water, courses, and, tanks, but, neither, palaces, nor, temples, have, been, identified, though, cities, have, a, central, raised, and, fortified, citadel, mohenjo, daro, has, wells, which, may, be, the, predecessors, of, the, stepwell, as, many, as, 700, wells, have, been, discovered, in, just, one, section, of, the, city, leading, scholars, to, believe, that, cylindrical, brick, lined, wells, were, invented, by, the, indus, valley, civilization, architectural, decoration, is, extremely, minimal, though, there, are, narrow, pointed, niches, inside, some, buildings, most, of, the, art, found, is, in, miniature, forms, like, seals, and, mainly, in, terracotta, but, there, are, very, few, larger, sculptures, of, figures, in, most, sites, fired, mud, brick, not, sun, baked, as, in, mesopotamia, is, used, exclusively, as, the, building, material, but, a, few, sites, such, as, dholavira, are, in, stone, most, houses, have, two, storeys, and, uniform, sizes, and, plans, the, large, cities, declined, relatively, quickly, for, unknown, reasons, so, a, less, sophisticated, village, culture, was, left, behind, after, the, collapse, of, the, mature, harappan, period, some, cities, still, remained, urban, and, inhabited, sites, like, bet, dwarka, in, gujarat, kudwala, 38, 1, ha, in, cholistan, and, daimabad, 20, ha, in, maharashtra, are, considered, urban, daimabad, 2000, 1000, bc, developed, a, fortification, wall, with, bastions, in, its, jorwe, culture, period, 1400, 1000, bc, and, had, public, buildings, such, as, an, elliptical, temple, and, an, apsidal, temple, it, also, shows, evidence, of, planning, in, the, layout, of, rectangular, houses, and, streets, or, lanes, and, planned, streets, the, area, had, risen, to, 50, hectares, in, with, a, population, of, 10, 000, people, a, 580, metre, 1, 900, ft, long, protection, wall, dated, 1500, bce, was, found, at, bet, dwarka, which, was, believed, to, be, damaged, and, submerged, following, a, sea, storm, indian, architecture, after, the, indus, valley, civilization, around, the, maurya, empire, from, 322, to, 185, bce, most, likely, used, wood, or, recycled, brick, much, of, the, remains, discovered, from, this, period, onwards, are, of, indian, rock, cut, architecture, predominantly, buddhist, the, construction, of, buddhist, monastic, buildings, began, before, the, death, of, the, buddha, around, 400, bce, this, first, generation, of, monasteries, only, survive, in, floor, plans, notably, the, jivakarama, vihara, in, bihar, important, features, of, the, period, s, architecture, include, walled, and, moated, cities, with, large, gates, and, multi, storied, buildings, wooden, chaitya, arches, for, roofs, and, further, structures, above, solid, storeys, the, reliefs, of, sanchi, dated, to, the, 1st, centuries, bce, ce, denote, places, such, as, kushinagar, or, rajagriha, as, splendid, walled, cities, as, in, the, royal, cortege, leaving, rajagriha, or, war, over, the, buddha, s, relics, these, views, of, ancient, indian, cities, are, relied, on, for, the, understanding, of, ancient, indian, urban, architecture, in, the, case, of, the, mauryan, capital, pataliputra, near, patna, we, have, greek, accounts, and, that, of, faxian, megasthenes, a, visitor, around, 300, bce, mentions, 564, towers, and, 64, gates, in, the, city, walls, modern, excavations, have, uncovered, a, massive, palisade, of, teak, beams, held, together, with, iron, dowels, a, huge, apadana, like, hall, with, eighty, sandstone, columns, shows, clear, influence, from, contemporary, achaemenid, persia, the, single, massive, sandstone, pataliputra, capital, shows, clear, hellenistic, features, reaching, india, via, persia, the, famous, ashoka, columns, show, great, sophistication, and, a, variety, of, influences, in, their, details, in, both, these, cases, a, now, vanished, indian, predecessor, tradition, in, wood, is, likely, such, a, tradition, is, extremely, clear, in, the, case, of, the, earliest, known, examples, of, rock, cut, architecture, the, state, sponsored, barabar, caves, in, bihar, personally, dedicated, by, ashoka, circa, 250, bce, the, entrance, of, the, lomas, rishi, cave, there, has, a, sculpted, doorway, that, clearly, copies, a, wooden, style, in, stone, which, is, a, recurrent, feature, of, rock, cut, caves, for, some, time, these, artificial, caves, exhibit, an, amazing, level, of, technical, proficiency, the, extremely, hard, granite, rock, being, cut, in, geometrical, fashion, and, given, the, mauryan, polish, also, found, on, sculpture, later, rock, cut, viharas, occupied, by, monastic, communities, survive, mostly, in, western, india, and, in, bengal, the, floor, plans, of, brick, built, equivalents, survive, the, elaborately, decorated, facades, and, chaitya, halls, of, many, rock, cut, sites, are, believed, to, reflect, vanished, free, standing, buildings, elsewhere, the, buddhist, stupa, a, dome, shaped, monument, was, used, in, india, as, a, commemorative, monument, associated, with, storing, sacred, relics, the, stupa, architecture, was, adopted, in, southeast, and, east, asia, where, it, became, prominent, as, a, buddhist, monument, used, for, enshrining, sacred, relics, guard, rails, consisting, of, posts, crossbars, and, a, coping, became, a, feature, of, safety, surrounding, a, stupa, temples, build, on, elliptical, circular, quadrilateral, or, apsidal, plans, were, constructed, using, brick, and, timber, the, indian, gateway, arches, the, torana, reached, east, asia, with, the, spread, of, buddhism, some, scholars, hold, that, torii, derives, from, the, torana, gates, at, the, buddhist, historic, site, of, sanchi, 3rd, century, bce, 11th, century, ce, rock, cut, stepwells, in, india, date, from, 200, to, 400, ce, subsequently, the, construction, of, wells, at, dhank, 550, 625, ce, and, stepped, ponds, at, bhinmal, 850, 950, ce, took, place, cave, temples, became, prominent, throughout, western, india, incorporating, various, unique, features, to, give, rise, to, cave, architecture, in, places, such, as, the, caves, at, ajanta, and, ellora, a, very, important, development, the, emergence, of, the, shikara, or, temple, tower, is, today, best, evidenced, by, the, buddhist, mahabodhi, temple, this, was, already, several, centuries, old, when, the, first, very, vertical, structure, replaced, an, ashokan, original, apparently, around, 150, 200, ce, the, current, brick, built, tower, probably, a, good, deal, larger, dates, to, the, gupta, period, in, the, 5th, or, 6th, centuries, the, gupta, period, chiefly, represented, a, hiatus, in, indian, rock, cut, architecture, the, first, wave, of, construction, was, completed, before, the, empire, was, assembled, and, the, second, wave, began, in, the, late, 5th, century, after, its, end, for, example, an, early, group, of, the, ajanta, caves, was, crafted, by, 220, ce, and, a, later, group, was, made, around, 460, ce, nonetheless, most, of, the, first, surviving, free, standing, structures, in, india, are, accredited, to, the, gupta, period, in, particular, the, beginnings, of, hindu, temple, architecture, as, milo, beach, writes, under, the, guptas, india, was, quick, to, join, the, rest, of, the, medieval, world, in, a, passion, for, housing, precious, objects, in, stylized, architectural, frameworks, the, precious, objects, primarily, suggesting, the, icons, of, gods, the, caves, at, ajanta, including, elephanta, and, ellora, respectively, buddhist, hindu, mixed, and, jain, were, produced, under, other, dynasties, in, central, india, ellora, was, made, after, the, gupta, period, yet, they, primarily, reflect, the, monumentality, and, balance, of, guptan, style, the, ajanta, caves, contain, the, most, significant, and, mature, survivals, of, painting, and, the, periods, mainly, in, palace, paintings, the, hindu, udayagiri, caves, record, connections, with, the, dynasty, and, its, ministers, and, the, dashavatara, temple, at, deogarh, one, of, the, earliest, to, survive, showcases, important, sculpture, north, indian, hindu, temples, that, have, survived, after, the, 5th, century, udayagiri, caves, in, madhya, pradesh, include, those, at, tigawa, early, 5th, century, sanchi, temple, 17, similar, but, respectively, hindu, and, buddhist, deogarh, parvati, temple, nachna, 465, bhitargaon, the, largest, gupta, brick, temple, to, survive, and, lakshman, brick, temple, sirpur, 600, 625, gop, temple, in, gujarat, c, 550, or, later, is, an, oddity, with, no, surviving, close, comparator, there, are, a, number, of, broad, models, of, guptan, style, temples, however, the, most, common, plan, exemplifies, small, but, massively, built, stone, prostyle, buildings, with, a, sanctuary, and, a, columned, porch, apparent, at, tigawa, and, sanchi, temple, 17, and, continued, today, both, temples, have, flat, roofs, over, the, sanctuary, which, would, become, uncommon, by, about, the, 8th, century, as, seen, in, the, design, of, the, mahabodhi, temple, bhitargaon, deogarh, and, gop, with, high, superstructures, of, different, shapes, the, chejarla, kapoteswara, temple, further, demonstrates, the, continuance, of, free, standing, chaitya, hall, temples, with, barrel, roofs, with, many, smaller, wooden, examples, whereas, the, visible, stylistic, forms, of, the, temple, vary, greatly, and, have, a, complicated, development, the, basic, elements, of, a, hindu, temple, remain, the, same, across, all, periods, and, styles, the, most, essential, feature, is, the, inner, sanctuary, the, garbhagriha, or, womb, chamber, where, the, primary, murti, of, a, deity, is, housed, in, around, this, chamber, are, other, structures, and, buildings, at, times, covering, several, acres, on, the, exterior, the, garbhagriha, is, crowned, by, a, tower, like, shikhara, also, called, the, vimana, in, the, south, the, temple, may, include, an, ambulatory, for, parikrama, circumambulation, one, or, more, mandapas, or, congregation, halls, and, sometimes, an, antarala, antechamber, and, porch, between, the, garbhagriha, and, mandapa, larger, temples, may, include, more, shrines, or, buildings, either, connected, together, or, detached, with, smaller, temples, in, the, compound, the, entire, temple, compound, is, usually, enclosed, by, a, wall, and, at, times, raised, on, a, plinth, adhi, h, na, large, areas, of, the, structure, are, often, decorated, with, carving, including, figurative, images, of, deities, and, other, religious, figures, by, the, 7th, century, ce, most, key, features, of, the, hindu, temple, were, established, in, theoretical, texts, on, temple, architecture, and, building, methods, three, styles, of, temple, were, identified, nagara, dravida, and, vesara, the, styles, were, sometimes, mixed, and, not, yet, associated, with, specific, regions, in, india, for, example, in, karnataka, the, group, of, 7th, and, 8th, century, temples, at, pattadakal, famously, mixes, forms, later, associated, with, both, north, and, south, as, does, that, at, aihole, which, still, includes, apsidal, chaitya, hall, type, plans, nagara, commonly, refers, to, north, indian, temple, styles, most, easily, recognised, by, a, high, and, curving, shikhara, over, the, sanctuary, dravida, or, dravidian, architecture, is, the, broad, south, indian, style, possessing, a, lower, superstructure, over, the, sanctuary, instead, the, structure, has, a, straight, profile, rising, in, a, series, of, terraces, to, form, a, decorated, pyramid, today, this, is, often, dwarfed, in, larger, temples, by, the, far, larger, gopuram, outer, gateways, a, much, later, development, the, ancient, term, vesara, is, also, used, to, describe, a, temple, style, with, characteristics, of, both, the, northern, and, southern, traditions, these, attributes, come, from, the, deccan, and, other, fairly, central, parts, of, india, although, disagreement, stands, on, the, exact, period, and, styles, that, vesara, represents, the, term, is, mainly, assigned, to, the, northern, tradition, but, are, regarded, as, a, kind, of, northern, dravida, by, others, excluding, earlier, structures, in, timber, based, architecture, hardly, any, remains, of, nagara, hindu, temples, exist, from, before, the, gupta, dynasty, in, the, 4th, century, ce, the, rock, cut, udayagiri, caves, are, among, the, most, important, early, sites, the, earliest, preserved, hindu, temples, are, simple, cell, like, stone, temples, some, rock, cut, and, others, structural, as, at, sanchi, by, the, 6th, or, 7th, century, these, evolved, into, high, shikhara, stone, superstructures, however, there, is, inscriptional, evidence, such, as, the, ancient, gangadhara, inscription, from, around, 424, that, towering, temples, predated, the, 6th, or, 7th, century, and, they, were, made, from, more, perishable, material, these, temples, have, not, survived, early, north, indian, temples, that, have, survived, after, the, 5th, century, udayagiri, caves, in, madhya, pradesh, include, deogarh, parvati, temple, nachna, 465, ce, lalitpur, district, c, 525, lakshman, brick, temple, sirpur, 600, 625, ce, rajiv, lochan, temple, and, rajim, 7th, century, ce, pre, 7th, century, ce, south, indian, style, stone, temples, have, not, survived, however, early, south, indian, temples, that, have, survived, though, in, ruins, include, the, diverse, styles, at, mahabalipuram, from, the, 7th, and, 8th, centuries, according, to, meister, the, mahabalipuram, temples, are, monolithic, models, of, a, variety, of, formal, structures, all, of, which, already, can, be, said, to, typify, a, developed, tamil, architecture, south, indian, order, they, suggest, a, tradition, and, a, knowledge, base, existing, in, south, india, by, the, time, of, the, early, chalukya, and, pallava, era, when, these, were, built, other, examples, are, found, in, aihole, and, pattadakal, from, between, about, the, 7th, and, 13th, centuries, a, large, number, of, temples, and, their, ruins, have, survived, though, far, fewer, than, once, existed, many, regional, styles, developed, very, often, following, political, divisions, as, large, temples, were, typically, built, with, royal, patronage, in, the, north, muslim, invasions, from, the, 11th, century, onwards, reduced, the, building, of, temples, and, saw, the, loss, of, many, existing, ones, the, south, also, witnessed, hindu, muslim, conflict, that, affected, the, temples, but, the, region, was, relatively, less, affected, than, the, north, in, the, late, 14th, century, the, hindu, vijayanagara, empire, came, to, power, and, controlled, much, of, south, india, during, this, period, the, distinctive, very, tall, gopuram, gatehouse, actually, a, late, development, from, the, 12th, century, or, later, typically, added, to, older, large, temples, the, recently, constructed, ram, mandir, in, ayodhya, is, constructed, as, per, the, nagara, style, north, indian, temples, showed, increased, elevation, of, the, wall, and, elaborate, spire, by, the, 10th, century, on, the, shikara, the, oldest, form, called, latina, with, wide, shallow, projections, running, up, the, sides, developed, alternative, forms, with, many, smaller, spirelets, urushringa, two, varieties, of, these, are, called, sekhari, where, the, sub, spires, extend, vertically, and, bhumija, where, individual, sub, spires, are, arrayed, in, rows, and, columns, richly, decorated, temples, including, the, complex, at, khajuraho, were, constructed, in, central, india, examples, include, the, lingaraja, temple, at, bhubaneshwar, in, odisha, sun, temple, at, konark, in, odisha, brihadeeswarar, temple, at, thanjavur, in, tamil, nadu, indian, traders, brought, indian, architecture, to, south, east, asia, through, various, trade, routes, styles, called, vesara, include, the, early, badami, chalukya, architecture, western, chalukya, architecture, and, finally, hoysala, architecture, other, regional, styles, include, those, of, bengal, kashmir, and, other, himalayan, areas, karnataka, kalinga, architecture, and, m, ru, gurjara, architecture, hoysala, architecture, is, the, distinctive, building, style, developed, under, the, rule, of, the, hoysala, empire, in, the, region, historically, known, as, karnata, today, s, karnataka, india, between, the, 11th, and, the, 14th, centuries, large, and, small, temples, built, during, this, era, remain, as, examples, of, the, hoysala, architectural, style, including, the, chennakesava, temple, at, belur, the, hoysaleswara, temple, at, halebidu, and, the, kesava, temple, at, somanathapura, other, examples, of, fine, hoysala, craftmanship, are, the, temples, at, belavadi, amrithapura, and, nuggehalli, study, of, the, hoysala, architectural, style, has, revealed, a, negligible, indo, aryan, influence, while, the, impact, of, southern, indian, style, is, more, distinct, a, feature, of, hoysala, temple, architecture, is, its, attention, to, detail, and, skilled, craftsmanship, the, temples, of, belur, and, halebidu, are, proposed, unesco, world, heritage, sites, approximately, 100, hoysala, temples, survive, today, the, khajuraho, temples, are, a, group, of, hindu, and, jain, temples, located, in, the, town, of, khajuraho, in, the, chhatarpur, district, of, madhya, pradesh, india, the, temples, were, built, between, 950, and, 1050, by, the, chandela, dynasty, khajuraho, is, home, to, 25, sandstone, temples, in, total, although, only, 20, remain, mostly, intact, the, beautiful, carvings, on, these, temples, which, show, themes, from, hindu, mythology, as, well, as, other, facets, of, everyday, life, in, ancient, india, are, well, known, both, hindu, and, jain, architectural, influences, may, be, seen, in, their, design, the, temples, are, split, into, three, groups, the, western, group, the, eastern, group, and, the, southern, group, the, western, group, has, the, greatest, popularity, and, draws, the, most, tourists, the, khajuraho, temples, were, declared, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, in, 1986, and, they, continue, to, be, a, popular, tourist, attraction, in, india, according, to, unesco, the, khajuraho, temples, are, a, masterpiece, of, indian, art, with, their, unique, architecture, and, stunning, sculptures, dravidian, style, or, the, south, indian, temple, style, is, an, architectural, idiom, in, hindu, temple, architecture, that, emerged, in, the, southern, part, of, the, indian, subcontinent, or, south, india, and, in, sri, lanka, reaching, its, final, form, by, the, sixteenth, century, it, is, seen, in, hindu, temples, and, the, most, distinctive, difference, from, north, indian, styles, is, the, use, of, a, shorter, and, more, pyramidal, tower, over, the, garbhagriha, or, sanctuary, called, a, vimana, where, the, north, has, taller, towers, usually, bending, inwards, as, they, rise, called, shikharas, however, for, modern, visitors, to, larger, temples, the, dominating, feature, is, the, high, gopura, or, gatehouse, at, the, edge, of, the, compound, large, temples, have, several, dwarfing, the, vimana, these, are, a, much, more, recent, development, there, are, numerous, other, distinct, features, such, as, the, dwarapalakas, twin, guardians, at, the, main, entrance, and, the, inner, sanctum, of, the, temple, and, goshtams, deities, carved, in, niches, on, the, outer, side, walls, of, the, garbhagriha, mayamata, and, manasara, shilpa, texts, estimated, to, be, in, circulation, by, 5th, to, 7th, century, is, a, guidebook, on, dravidian, style, of, vastu, shastra, design, construction, sculpture, and, joinery, technique, isanasivagurudeva, paddhati, is, another, text, from, the, 9th, century, describing, the, art, of, building, in, india, in, south, and, central, india, from, 300, bce, 300, ce, the, greatest, accomplishments, of, the, kingdoms, of, the, early, chola, chera, and, the, pandyan, kingdoms, included, brick, shrines, to, deities, kartikeya, shiva, amman, and, vishnu, several, of, these, have, been, unearthed, near, adichanallur, kaveripoompuharpattinam, and, mahabalipuram, and, the, construction, plans, of, these, sites, of, worship, were, shared, to, some, detail, in, various, poems, of, sangam, literature, the, architecture, of, the, rock, cut, temples, particularly, the, rathas, became, a, model, for, south, indian, temples, architectural, features, particularly, the, sculptures, were, widely, adopted, in, south, india, descendants, of, the, sculptors, of, the, shrines, are, artisans, in, contemporary, mahabalipuram, the, badami, chalukyas, also, called, the, early, chalukyas, ruled, from, badami, karnataka, in, the, period, 543, 753, and, spawned, the, vesara, style, called, badami, chalukya, architecture, the, finest, examples, of, their, art, are, seen, in, pattadakal, aihole, and, badami, in, northern, karnataka, over, 150, temples, remain, in, the, malaprabha, basin, the, rashtrakuta, contributions, to, art, and, architecture, are, reflected, in, the, splendid, rock, cut, shrines, at, ellora, and, elephanta, situated, in, present, day, maharashtra, it, is, said, that, they, altogether, constructed, 34, rock, cut, shrines, but, most, extensive, and, sumptuous, of, them, all, is, the, kailasanatha, temple, at, ellora, the, temple, is, a, splendid, achievement, of, dravidian, art, the, walls, of, the, temple, have, marvellous, sculptures, from, hindu, mythology, including, ravana, shiva, and, parvathi, while, the, ceilings, have, paintings, these, projects, spread, into, south, india, from, the, deccan, the, architectural, style, used, was, partly, dravidian, they, do, not, contain, any, of, the, shikharas, common, to, the, nagara, style, and, were, built, on, the, same, lines, as, the, virupaksha, temple, at, pattadakal, in, karnataka, vijayanagara, architecture, of, the, period, 1336, 1565, was, a, notable, building, style, evolved, by, the, vijayanagar, empire, that, ruled, most, of, south, india, from, their, capital, at, vijayanagara, on, the, banks, of, the, tungabhadra, river, in, present, day, karnataka, the, architecture, of, the, temples, built, during, the, reign, of, the, vijayanagara, empire, had, elements, of, political, authority, this, resulted, in, the, creation, of, a, distinctive, imperial, style, of, architecture, which, featured, prominently, not, only, in, temples, but, also, in, administrative, structures, across, the, deccan, the, vijayanagara, style, is, a, combination, of, the, chalukya, hoysala, pandya, and, chola, styles, which, evolved, earlier, in, the, centuries, when, these, empires, ruled, and, is, characterised, by, a, return, to, the, simplistic, and, serene, art, of, the, past, the, south, indian, temple, consists, essentially, of, a, square, chambered, sanctuary, topped, by, a, superstructure, tower, or, spire, and, an, attached, pillared, porch, or, hall, ma, apa, or, ma, apam, enclosed, by, a, peristyle, of, cells, within, a, rectangular, court, the, external, walls, of, the, temple, are, segmented, by, pilasters, and, carry, niches, housing, sculpture, the, superstructure, or, tower, above, the, sanctuary, is, of, the, k, ina, type, and, consists, of, an, arrangement, of, gradually, receding, stories, in, a, pyramidal, shape, each, story, is, delineated, by, a, parapet, of, miniature, shrines, square, at, the, corners, and, rectangular, with, barrel, vault, roofs, at, the, centre, the, warangal, fort, thousand, pillar, temple, and, ramappa, temple, are, examples, of, kakatiya, architecture, the, style, adopted, in, the, region, that, today, lies, in, the, modern, states, of, karnataka, and, andhra, pradesh, deccan, which, served, in, its, geographical, position, as, buffer, between, north, and, south, that, architectural, style, has, mix, of, both, the, nagara, and, dravidian, temple, styles, while, some, scholars, consider, the, buildings, in, this, region, as, being, distinctly, either, nagara, or, dravida, a, hybridised, style, that, seems, to, have, become, popular, after, the, mid, seventh, century, is, known, in, some, ancient, texts, as, vesara, in, the, southern, part, of, the, deccan, i, e, in, the, region, of, karnataka, is, where, some, of, the, most, experimental, hybrid, styles, of, vesara, architecture, are, to, be, found, an, important, temple, is, papnath, temple, dedicated, to, lord, shiva, the, temple, is, one, of, the, best, early, examples, of, the, south, indian, tradition, by, contrast, other, eastern, chalukyan, temples, like, the, mahakuta, five, kilometres, from, badami, and, the, swarga, brahma, temple, at, alampur, show, a, greater, assimilation, of, northern, styles, from, odisha, and, rajasthan, at, the, same, time, the, durga, temple, at, aihole, is, unique, having, an, even, earlier, style, of, an, apsidal, shrine, which, is, reminiscent, of, buddhist, chaitya, halls, and, is, surrounded, by, a, veranda, of, a, later, kind, with, a, shikhara, that, is, stylistically, like, a, nagara, one, the, lad, khan, temple, at, aihole, in, karnataka, seems, to, be, inspired, by, the, wooden, roofed, temples, of, the, hills, except, that, it, is, constructed, out, of, stone, historians, agree, that, the, vesara, style, originated, in, what, is, today, karnataka, according, to, some, the, style, was, started, by, the, chalukyas, of, badami, 500, 753ad, whose, early, chalukya, or, badami, chalukya, architecture, built, temples, in, a, style, that, mixed, some, features, of, the, nagara, and, the, dravida, styles, for, example, using, both, the, northern, shikhara, and, southern, vimana, type, of, superstructure, over, the, sanctum, in, different, temples, of, similar, date, as, at, pattadakal, however, adam, hardy, and, others, regard, this, style, as, essentially, a, form, of, dravida, this, style, was, further, refined, by, the, rashtrakutas, of, manyakheta, 750, 983ad, in, sites, such, as, ellora, though, there, is, clearly, a, good, deal, of, continuity, with, the, badami, or, early, chalukya, style, other, writers, only, date, the, start, of, vesara, to, the, later, western, chalukyas, of, kalyani, 983, 1195, ad, in, sites, such, as, lakkundi, dambal, itagi, and, gadag, and, continued, by, the, hoysala, empire, 1000, 1330, ad, the, hoysala, temples, at, belur, halebidu, and, somanathapura, are, leading, examples, of, the, vesara, style, these, temples, are, now, proposed, as, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, jain, temple, architecture, is, generally, close, to, hindu, temple, architecture, and, in, ancient, times, buddhist, religious, architecture, normally, the, same, builders, and, carvers, worked, for, all, religions, and, regional, and, period, styles, are, generally, similar, the, basic, layout, of, a, hindu, and, most, jain, temples, has, consisted, of, a, small, garbhagriha, or, sanctuary, for, the, main, murti, or, cult, images, over, which, the, high, superstructure, rises, then, one, or, more, larger, mandapa, halls, the, earliest, survivals, of, jain, architecture, are, part, of, the, indian, rock, cut, architecture, tradition, initially, shared, with, buddhism, and, by, the, end, of, the, classical, period, with, hinduism, very, often, numbers, of, rock, cut, jain, temples, and, monasteries, share, a, site, with, those, of, the, other, religions, as, at, udayagiri, bava, pyara, ellora, aihole, badami, and, kalugumalai, the, ellora, caves, are, a, late, site, which, contains, temples, of, all, three, religions, as, the, earlier, buddhist, ones, give, way, to, later, hindu, excavations, there, is, considerable, similarity, between, the, styles, of, the, different, religions, but, often, the, jains, placed, large, figures, of, one, or, more, of, the, 24, tirthankaras, in, the, open, air, rather, than, inside, the, shrine, these, statues, later, began, to, be, very, large, normally, standing, nude, figures, in, the, kayotsarga, meditation, position, which, is, similar, to, standing, at, attention, examples, include, the, gopachal, rock, cut, jain, monuments, and, the, siddhachal, caves, with, groups, of, statues, and, a, number, of, single, figures, including, the, 12th, century, gommateshwara, statue, and, the, modern, statue, of, vasupujya, and, largest, of, all, at, 108, feet, 33, meters, tall, the, statue, of, ahimsa, the, main, buildings, of, the, largest, dilwara, temples, are, surrounded, by, cloister, screens, of, devakulik, shrines, and, are, fairly, plain, on, the, outer, walls, of, these, in, the, case, of, the, vimal, vasahi, this, screen, was, a, later, addition, around, the, time, of, the, second, temple, surrounding, the, main, temple, with, a, curtain, of, shrines, was, to, become, a, distinctive, feature, of, the, jain, temples, of, west, india, still, employed, in, some, modern, temples, mostly, funded, by, private, individuals, or, groups, and, catering, to, a, smaller, population, jain, temples, tend, to, be, at, the, small, or, middle, end, of, the, range, of, sizes, but, at, pilgrimage, sites, they, may, cluster, in, large, groups, there, are, altogether, several, hundred, at, palitana, tightly, packed, within, several, high, walled, compounds, called, tuks, or, tonks, temple, charitable, trusts, such, as, the, very, large, anandji, kalyanji, trust, founded, in, the, 17th, century, and, now, maintaining, 1, 200, temples, play, a, very, important, role, in, funding, temple, building, and, maintenance, regional, differences, in, hindu, temples, are, largely, reflected, in, jain, ones, except, that, m, ru, gurjara, architecture, or, the, solanki, style, has, become, to, some, extent, a, pan, indian, indeed, pan, global, jain, style, this, is, a, particular, temple, style, from, gujarat, and, rajasthan, both, regions, with, a, strong, jain, presence, that, originated, in, both, hindu, and, jain, temples, around, 1000, but, became, enduringly, popular, with, jain, patrons, spreading, to, other, parts, of, india, and, the, global, jain, diaspora, of, the, last, century, it, has, remained, in, use, in, somewhat, modified, form, to, the, present, day, indeed, also, becoming, popular, again, for, some, hindu, temples, in, the, last, century, the, style, is, seen, in, the, groups, of, pilgrimage, temples, at, dilwara, on, mount, abu, taranga, girnar, and, palitana, interiors, are, more, lavishly, decorated, with, elaborate, carving, on, most, surfaces, in, particular, jain, temples, often, have, small, low, domes, carved, on, the, inside, with, a, highly, intricate, rosette, design, another, distinctive, feature, is, flying, arch, like, elements, between, pillars, touching, the, horizontal, beam, above, in, the, centre, and, elaborately, carved, these, have, no, structural, function, and, are, purely, decorative, the, style, developed, large, pillared, halls, many, open, at, the, sides, with, jain, temples, often, having, one, closed, and, two, pillared, halls, in, sequence, on, the, main, axis, leading, to, the, shrine, the, m, ru, gurjara, style, did, not, represent, a, radical, break, with, earlier, styles, the, previous, styles, in, north, west, india, and, the, group, of, jain, temples, of, khajuraho, forming, part, of, the, famous, khajuraho, group, of, monuments, are, very, largely, in, the, same, style, as, their, hindu, companions, which, were, mostly, built, between, 950, and, 1050, they, share, many, features, with, the, m, ru, gurjara, style, high, plinths, with, many, decorated, bands, on, the, walls, lavish, figurative, and, decorative, carving, balconies, looking, out, on, multiple, sides, ceiling, rosettes, and, others, but, at, khajuraho, the, great, height, of, the, shikharas, is, given, more, emphasis, there, are, similarities, with, the, contemporary, hoysala, architecture, from, much, further, south, in, both, of, these, styles, architecture, is, treated, sculpturally, the, indo, islamic, architecture, began, under, influence, of, islam, in, indian, subcontinent, around, the, 7th, century, ad, many, of, these, styles, are, also, influence, by, regional, indian, architecture, it, also, replace, indian, trabeate, style, with, arcuate, style, turks, and, persians, who, inherited, wealth, of, various, design, from, sassanian, and, byzantine, empire, shaped, and, influenced, the, architecture, islamic, buildings, initially, adapted, the, skills, of, a, workforce, trained, in, earlier, indian, traditions, to, their, own, designs, unlike, most, of, the, islamic, world, where, brick, tended, to, predominate, india, had, highly, skilled, builders, well, used, to, producing, stone, masonry, of, extremely, high, quality, alongside, the, architecture, developed, in, delhi, and, prominent, centres, of, mughal, culture, such, as, agra, lahore, and, allahabad, a, variety, of, regional, styles, developed, in, regional, kingdoms, like, the, bengal, gujarat, deccan, jaunpur, and, kashmir, sultanates, following, the, collapse, of, the, mughal, empire, regional, nawabs, such, as, in, lucknow, hyderabad, and, mysore, continued, to, commission, and, patronize, the, construction, of, mughal, commissioned, architecture, in, the, princely, states, significant, regional, styles, developed, in, the, independent, sultanates, formed, when, the, tughlaq, empire, weakened, in, the, mid, 14th, century, and, lasted, until, most, were, absorbed, into, the, mughal, empire, in, the, 16th, century, apart, from, the, sultanates, of, the, deccan, plateau, gujarat, bengal, and, kashmir, the, architecture, of, the, malwa, and, jaunpur, sultanates, also, left, some, significant, buildings, the, start, of, the, delhi, sultanate, in, 1206, under, qutb, al, din, aibak, introduced, a, large, islamic, state, to, india, using, central, asian, styles, the, important, qutb, complex, in, delhi, was, begun, under, muhammad, of, ghor, by, 1199, and, continued, under, qutb, al, din, aibak, and, later, sultans, the, quwwat, ul, islam, mosque, now, a, ruin, was, the, first, structure, like, other, early, islamic, buildings, it, re, used, elements, such, as, columns, from, destroyed, hindu, and, jain, temples, including, one, on, the, same, site, whose, platform, was, reused, the, arches, were, corbelled, in, the, traditional, indian, way, alai, minar, a, minaret, twice, the, size, of, qutb, minar, was, commissioned, by, alauddin, khilji, but, never, completed, other, examples, include, the, tughlaqabad, fort, and, hauz, khas, complex, another, very, early, mosque, begun, in, the, 1190s, is, the, adhai, din, ka, jhonpra, in, ajmer, rajasthan, built, for, the, same, delhi, rulers, again, with, corbelled, arches, and, domes, here, hindu, temple, columns, and, possibly, some, new, ones, are, piled, up, in, threes, to, achieve, extra, height, both, mosques, had, large, detached, screens, with, pointed, corbelled, arches, added, in, front, of, them, probably, under, iltutmish, a, couple, of, decades, later, at, ajmer, the, smaller, screen, arches, are, tentatively, cusped, for, the, first, time, in, india, by, around, 1300, true, domes, and, arches, with, voussoirs, were, being, built, the, ruined, tomb, of, balban, d, 1287, in, delhi, may, be, the, earliest, survival, the, alai, darwaza, gatehouse, at, the, qutb, complex, from, 1311, still, shows, a, cautious, approach, to, the, new, technology, with, very, thick, walls, and, a, shallow, dome, only, visible, from, a, certain, distance, or, height, bold, contrasting, colours, of, masonry, with, red, sandstone, and, white, marble, introduce, what, was, to, become, a, common, feature, of, indo, islamic, architecture, substituting, for, the, polychrome, tiles, used, in, persia, and, central, asia, the, pointed, arches, come, together, slightly, at, their, base, giving, a, mild, horseshoe, arch, effect, and, their, internal, edges, are, not, cusped, but, lined, with, conventionalized, spearhead, projections, possibly, representing, lotus, buds, jali, stone, openwork, screens, are, introduced, here, they, already, had, been, long, used, in, temples, by, the, time, of, tughlaqs, islamic, architecture, in, india, had, adopted, some, features, of, earlier, indian, architecture, such, as, the, use, of, a, high, plinth, and, often, mouldings, around, its, edges, as, well, as, columns, and, brackets, and, hypostyle, halls, after, the, death, of, firoz, the, tughlaqs, declined, and, the, following, delhi, dynasties, were, weak, most, of, the, monumental, buildings, constructed, were, tombs, although, the, impressive, lodi, gardens, in, delhi, adorned, with, fountains, charbagh, gardens, ponds, tombs, and, mosques, were, constructed, by, the, late, lodi, dynasty, the, architecture, of, other, regional, muslim, states, was, often, more, impressive, dawood, shah, of, bahamani, sultanate, ruled, for, very, short, amount, of, time, in, 1378, but, invented, a, new, style, of, tomb, comprising, two, similar, domed, structures, on, a, single, basement, a, style, not, seen, anywhere, outside, kalaburagi, firuz, shah, who, died, in, 1422, copied, the, double, chambered, style, but, made, his, tomb, much, simpler, the, black, basalt, door, jambs, reminiscent, of, temple, pillars, the, recessed, arches, bearing, stucco, floral, work, arches, bearing, stucco, floral, work, and, the, chajjas, borne, on, brackets, that, resemble, those, found, in, temples, all, become, common, features, in, later, bahmani, architecture, rangin, mahal, in, bidar, fort, built, by, ali, barid, shah, in, the, 1500s, while, the, beautiful, tile, mosaics, on, some, of, its, walls, and, the, luminescent, mother, of, pearl, inlays, on, black, basalt, are, persian, in, style, its, carved, wooden, pillars, and, brackets, are, clearly, derived, from, local, residential, architecture, the, main, architectural, activities, for, the, barid, shahi, rulers, were, building, garden, tombs, the, tomb, of, ali, barid, shah, 1577, is, the, most, notable, monument, in, bidar, the, tomb, consists, of, a, lofty, domed, chamber, open, on, four, sides, located, in, the, middle, of, a, persian, four, square, garden, the, rangin, mahal, in, bidar, built, during, the, reign, of, ali, barid, shah, is, a, complete, and, exquisitely, decorated, courtly, structure, other, important, monuments, in, bidar, from, this, period, are, the, tomb, of, qasim, ii, and, the, kali, masjid, amongst, the, major, architectural, works, in, the, bijapur, sultanate, one, of, the, earliest, is, the, unfinished, jami, masjid, which, was, begun, by, ali, adil, shah, i, in, 1576, it, has, an, arcaded, prayer, hall, with, fine, aisles, and, has, an, impressive, dome, supported, by, massive, piers, one, of, the, most, impressive, monuments, built, during, the, reign, of, ibrahim, ii, was, the, ibrahim, rouza, which, was, originally, planned, as, a, tomb, for, queen, taj, sultana, but, was, later, converted, into, the, tomb, for, ibrahim, adil, shah, ii, and, his, family, this, complex, completed, in, 1626, consists, of, a, paired, tomb, and, mosque, notable, buildings, of, the, bahmani, and, deccan, sultanates, in, the, deccan, include, the, charminar, mecca, masjid, qutb, shahi, tombs, madrasa, mahmud, gawan, and, gol, gumbaz, the, greatest, monument, in, bijapur, is, the, gol, gumbaz, the, mausoleum, of, muhammad, adil, shah, which, was, completed, in, 1656, and, whose, hemispherical, dome, measures, 44, metres, 144, ft, across, one, of, the, earliest, architectural, achievements, of, the, qutb, shahi, dynasty, is, the, fortified, city, of, golconda, which, is, now, in, ruins, in, the, 16th, century, muhammad, quli, qutb, shah, decided, to, shift, the, capital, to, hyderabad, 8, kilometres, 5, 0, mi, east, of, golconda, here, he, constructed, the, most, original, monument, in, the, deccan, the, charminar, in, the, heart, of, the, new, city, this, monument, completed, in, 1591, has, four, minarets, each, 56, metres, 184, ft, the, style, of, the, bengal, sultanate, mostly, used, brick, with, characteristic, features, being, indigenous, bengali, elements, such, as, curved, roofs, corner, towers, and, complex, terracotta, ornamentation, which, were, with, blended, one, feature, in, the, sultanate, was, the, relative, absence, of, minarets, many, small, and, medium, sized, medieval, mosques, with, multiple, domes, and, artistic, niche, mihrabs, were, constructed, throughout, the, region, these, features, are, also, seen, in, the, choto, sona, mosque, around, 1500, which, is, in, stone, unusually, for, bengal, but, shares, the, style, and, mixes, domes, and, a, curving, paddy, roof, based, on, village, house, roofs, made, of, vegetable, thatch, such, roofs, feature, even, more, strongly, in, later, bengal, hindu, temple, architecture, with, types, such, as, the, do, chala, jor, bangla, and, char, chala, for, larger, mosques, bengali, architects, multiplied, the, numbers, of, domes, with, a, nine, domed, formula, three, rows, of, three, being, one, option, surviving, in, four, examples, all, 15th, or, 16th, century, and, now, in, bangladesh, although, there, were, others, with, larger, numbers, of, domes, the, largest, mosque, in, the, indian, subcontinent, was, the, 14th, century, adina, mosque, built, of, stone, demolished, from, temples, it, featured, a, monumental, ribbed, barrel, vault, over, the, central, nave, the, first, such, giant, vault, used, anywhere, in, the, subcontinent, the, mosque, was, modelled, on, the, imperial, sassanian, style, of, persia, the, sultanate, style, flourished, between, the, 14th, and, 16th, centuries, a, provincial, style, influenced, by, north, india, evolved, in, mughal, bengal, during, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, the, mughals, also, copied, the, bengali, do, chala, roof, tradition, for, mausoleums, in, north, india, although, the, description, in, pandua, the, ancient, capital, shows, mainly, persian, culture, in, courts, we, find, one, of, the, first, attempts, at, fusing, together, the, islamic, and, bengali, style, of, architecture, under, ilyas, shahi, dynasty, who, ruled, then, under, jalaludin, emerged, the, bengal, style, of, mosques, with, jalaludin, s, reign, we, see, the, beginnings, of, a, trend, of, muslim, ruling, dynasty, that, grounded, itself, in, local, culture, rather, than, seeking, legitimacy, from, delhi, or, mecca, upon, his, return, to, delhi, from, his, first, bengal, expedition, firoz, shah, tughlaq, built, kotla, mosque, which, bear, a, striking, resemblance, to, the, bengal, style, by,

buddhist, pagoda, structure, as, well, as, the, wooden, khanqah, e, moulah, mosque, also, in, srinagar, are, the, aali, masjid, and, the, tomb, of, zain, ul, abidin, two, 14th, century, wooden, mosques, in, gilgit, baltistan, are, the, chaqchan, mosque, in, khaplu, 1370, and, the, amburiq, mosque, in, shigar, both, have, stone, built, cores, with, elaborately, carved, wooden, exterior, galleries, at, amburiq, on, two, levels, in, an, adaptation, of, traditional, local, styles, under, the, gujarat, sultanate, independent, between, 1407, and, 1543, gujarat, was, a, prosperous, regional, sultanate, under, the, rule, of, the, muzaffarid, dynasty, who, built, lavishly, particularly, in, the, capital, ahmedabad, in, its, distinctive, style, of, indo, islamic, architecture, the, sultanate, commissioned, mosques, such, as, the, jami, masjid, of, ahmedabad, jama, masjid, at, champaner, jami, masjid, at, khambhat, qutbuddin, mosque, rani, rupamati, mosque, sarkhej, roza, sidi,

ahmedabad, the, distinctive, indo, islamic, architecture, style, of, gujarat, drew, micro, architectural, elements, from, earlier, maru, gurjara, architecture, and, employed, them, in, mihrab, roofs, doors, minarets, and, facades, in, the, 15th, century, the, indo, islamic, style, of, gujarat, is, especially, notable, for, its, inventive, and, elegant, use, of, minarets, they, are, often, in, pairs, flanking, the, main, entrance, mostly, rather, thin, and, with, elaborate, carving, at, least, at, the, lower, levels, some, designs, push, out, balconies, at, intervals, up, the, shaft, the,

arches, in, its, architecture, but, structural, arches, have, been, essentially, absent, from, hindu, temple, architecture, at, all, periods, corbel, arches, in, india, date, from, indus, valley, civilisation, which, used, corbel, arch, to, construct, drains, and, have, been, evidenced, at, mohenjo, daro, harappa, and, dholavira, the, oldest, arches, surviving, in, indian, architecture, are, the, gavaksha, or, chaitya, arches, found, in, ancient, rock, cut, architecture, and, agreed, to, be, copied, from, versions, in, wood, which, have, all, perished, these, often, terminate, a, whole, ceiling, with, a, semi, circular, top, wooden, roofs, made, in, this, way, can, be, seen, in, carved, depictions, of, cities, and, palaces, a, number, of, small, early, constructed, temples, have,

architecture, not, as, an, opening, in, a, wall, but, as, a, blind, niche, projection, from, a, wall, that, bears, only, its, own, weight, in, this, form, it, became, a, very, common, and, important, decorative, motif, on, hindu, temples, the, fundamental, architectural, principle, of, the, constructed, hindu, temple, is, always, formulated, in, the, trabeate, order, that, is, to, say, using, post, and, lintel, systems, with, vertical, and, horizontal, members, according, to, george, michell, never, was, the, principle, of, the, arch, with, radiating, components, such, as, voussoirs, and, keystones, employed, in, hindu, structures, either, in, india, or, in, other, parts, of, asia, it, was, not, so, much, that, hindu, architects, were, ignorant, of, these, techniques, but, rather, that, conformance, to, tradition, and, adherence, to, precedents, were, firm, cultural, attitudes, harle, describes, the, true, arch, as, not, unknown, but, almost, never, employed, by, hindu, builders, and, its, use, as, rare, but, widely, dispersed, the, 19th, century, archaeologist, alexander, cunningham, head, of, the, archaeological, survey, of, india, at, first, believed, that, due, to, the, total, absence, of, arches, in, hindu, temples, they, were, alien, to, indian, architecture, but, several, pre, islamic, examples, bear, testimony, to, their, existence, as, explained, by, him, in, the, following, manner, formerly, it, was, the, settled, belief, of, all, european, enquirers, that, the, ancient, hindus, were, ignorant, of, the, arch, this, belief, no, doubt, arose, from, the, total, absence, of, arches, in, any, of, the, hindu, temples, thirty, years, ago, i, shared, this, belief, with, mr, fergusson, when, i, argued, that, the, presence, of, arches, in, the, great, buddhist, temple, at, buddha, gaya, proved, that, the, building, could, not, have, been, erected, before, the, muhammadan, conquest, but, during, my, late, employment, in, the, archeological, survey, of, india, several, buildings, of, undoubted, antiquity, were, discovered, in, which, both, vaults, and, arches, formed, part, of, the, original, construction, archaeological, evidences, indicate, that, wedge, shaped, bricks, and, construction, of, wells, in, the, indus, valley, civilization, and, although, no, true, arches, have, been, discovered, as, of, yet, these, bricks, would, have, been, suitable, in, the, construction, of, true, arches, true, arch, in, india, dates, from, pre, mauryan, nanda, period, from, the, 5th, century, bc, arch, fragment, discovered, by, archaeologist, k, p, jayaswal, from, an, arch, with, brahmi, inscribed, on, it, or, 1st, 2nd, century, ce, when, it, first, appeared, in, kausambi, palace, architecture, from, kushana, period, arches, present, at, vishnu, temples, at, deo, baranark, amb, and, kafir, kot, temples, from, hindu, shahi, period, and, hindu, temple, of, bhitargaon, bear, testimony, to, the, use, arches, in, the, hindu, temple, architecture, although, alexander, cunningham, has, persisted, in, the, notion, that, the, buddhist, mahabodhi, temple, s, pointed, arch, was, added, later, during, a, burmese, restoration, given, its, predominant, use, in, islamic, architecture, scholars, such, as, huu, phuoc, le, have, contested, this, assumption, based, on, analysis, that, relieving, arches, could, not, have, been, added, without, destroying, the, entire, temple, structure, which, is, dated, to, 6th, 7th, century, ce, hence, the, pointed, and, relieving, arches, much, have, formed, part, of, the, original, building, dating, from, the, pre, islamic, periods, in, proper, moreover, pointed, arches, vaulted, entrances, have, been, noted, in, bhitargaon, temple, and, kausambi, palace, architecture, as, well, trabeate, style, is, one, of,

temple, include, brick, vaulted, halls, buddha, statues, tapered, roofs, and, the, absence, of, terraces, pala, influence, and, spread, of, buddhism, in, myanmar, also, brought, in, terracotta, tiles, from, bengal, the, terracotta, plaques, at, pagan, are, made, with, well, kneaded, and, fired, clay, but, all, the, plaques, are, glazed, with, green, colour, another, example, of, these, cultural, influences, include, the, ananda, temple, in, bagan, built, in, the, 11th, century, ad, under, the, ruling, of, king, kyansittha, at, these, times, buddhist, and, vaisnava, monks, travelled, to, burma, from, bengal, and, discussed, commonalities, about, the, beauty, of, the, temples, of, their, region, therefore, the, king, heard, the, monks, and, decided, to, build, a, temple, with, these, western, inspirations, although, the, ananda, temple, display, its, eastern, origins, the, western, features, remain, obvious, and, demonstrate, its, uniqueness, ancient, indian, torana, sacred, gateway, architecture, has, influenced, gateway, architecture, across, asia, specially, where, buddhism, was, transmitted, from, india, chinese, paifang, gateways, japanese, torii, gateways, korean, hongsalmun, gateways, and, sao, ching, cha, in, thailand, have, been, derived, from, the, indian, torana, the, functions, of, all, are, similar, but, they, generally, differ, based, on, their, respective, architectural, styles, the, torii, a, gateway, erected, on, the, approach, to, every, shinto, shrine, may, be, derived, from, the, indian, word, torana, while, the, indian, term, denotes, a, gateway, the, japanese, characters, can, be, translated, as, bird, perch, the, function, of, a, torii, is, to, mark, the, entrance, to, a, sacred, space, for, this, reason, the, road, leading, to, a, shinto, shrine, sand, is, almost, always, straddled, by, one, or, more, torii, which, are, therefore, the, easiest, way, to, distinguish, a, shrine, from, a, buddhist, temple, hongsalmun, literally, means, gate, with, red, arrows, referring, to, the, set, of, pointed, spikes, on, its, top, in, the, past, spikes, in, between, columns, did, not, exist, the, color, is, said, to, be, red, because, of, the, belief, that, the, color, repels, ghosts, the, gate, is, composed, of, 2, round, poles, set, vertically, and, 2, transverse, bars, these, pillars, are, usually, over, 9, metres, 30, ft, in, height, there, is, no, roof, and, door, gate, in, the, middle, top, gate, the, symbol, of, the, trisula, and, the, taegeuk, image, are, placed, a, paifang, also, known, as, a, pailou, is, a, traditional, style, of, chinese, architectural, arch, or, gateway, structure, derived, from, the, torana, temple, gate, in, ancient, india, has, taken, on, traditional, chinese, architectural, characteristics, such, as, multi, tiered, roofs, various, supporting, posts, and, archway, shapes, of, traditional, gates, and, towers, the, greek, conquests, in, india, under, alexander, the, great, were, limited, in, time, 327, 326, bce, and, in, extent, but, they, had, extensive, long, term, effects, as, greeks, settled, for, centuries, at, the, doorstep, of, india, after, these, events, the, greeks, described, as, yona, or, yavana, in, indian, sources, from, the, greek, ionian, were, able, to, maintain, a, structured, presence, at, the, door, of, india, for, about, three, centuries, through, the, seleucid, empire, and, the, greco, bactrian, kingdom, down, to, the, time, of, the, indo, greek, kingdoms, which, ended, sometimes, in, the, 1st, century, ce, during, that, time, the, city, of, ai, khanoum, capital, of, the, greco, bactrian, kingdom, and, the, cities, of, sirkap, were, founded, in, what, is, now, pakistan, on, the, greek, hippodamian, grid, plan, and, sagala, now, located, in, pakistan, 10, km, from, the, border, with, india, interacted, heavily, with, the, indian, subcontinent, it, is, considered, that, ai, khanoum, and, sirkap, may, have, been, primary, actors, in, transmitting, western, artistic, influence, to, india, for, example, in, the, creation, of, the, quasi, ionic, pataliputra, capital, or, the, floral, friezes, of, the, pillars, of, ashoka, numerous, greek, ambassadors, such, as, megasthenes, deimachus, and, dionysius, stayed, at, the, mauryan, court, in, pataliputra, during, the, maurya, period, c, 321, 185, bce, and, especially, during, the, time, of, emperor, ashoka, c, 268, 232, bce, hellenistic, influence, seems, to, have, played, a, role, in, the, establishment, of, indian, monumental, stone, architecture, excavations, in, the, ancient, palace, of, pataliputra, have, brought, to, light, hellenistic, sculptural, works, and, hellenistic, influence, appear, in, the, pillars, of, ashoka, at, about, the, same, period, during, that, period, several, instance, of, artistic, influence, are, known, particular, in, the, area, of, monumental, stone, sculpture, and, statuary, an, area, with, no, known, precedents, in, india, the, main, period, of, stone, architectural, creation, seems, to, correspond, to, the, period, of, ashoka, s, reign, before, that, indians, had, a, tradition, of, wooden, architecture, remains, of, wooden, palisades, were, discovered, at, archaeological, sites, in, pataliputra, confirmed, the, classical, accounts, the, first, examples, of, stone, architecture, were, also, found, in, the, palace, compound, of, pataliputra, with, the, distinctly, hellenistic, pataliputra, capital, and, a, pillared, hall, using, polished, stone, columns, the, other, remarkable, example, of, monumental, stone, architecture, is, that, of, the, pillars, of, ashoka, themselves, displaying, hellenistic, influence, there, is, also, very, early, stone, architecture, in, the, palace, at, kosambi, including, true, arches, used, in, the, underground, chambers, from, the, last, phase, of, the, palace, in, the, 1st, or, 2nd, century, ce, the, pataliputra, capital, is, a, monumental, rectangular, capital, with, volutes, and, classical, designs, that, was, discovered, in, the, palace, ruins, of, the, ancient, mauryan, empire, capital, city, of, pataliputra, modern, patna, northeastern, india, it, is, dated, to, the, 3rd, century, bce, it, is, together, with, the, pillars, of, ashoka, one, of, the, first, known, examples, of, indian, stone, architecture, as, no, indian, stone, monuments, or, sculptures, are, known, from, before, that, period, it, is, also, one, of, the, first, archaeological, clues, suggesting, hellenistic, influence, on, the, arts, of, india, in, this, case, sculptural, palatial, art, the, pillars, of, ashoka, were, built, during, the, reign, of, the, maurya, empire, ashoka, c, 250, bce, they, were, new, attempts, at, mastering, stone, architecture, as, no, indian, stone, monuments, or, sculptures, are, known, from, before, that, period, there, are, altogether, seven, remaining, capitals, five, with, lions, one, with, an, elephant, and, one, with, a, zebu, bull, one, of, them, the, four, lions, of, sarnath, has, become, the, state, emblem, of, india, the, animal, capitals, are, composed, of, a, lotiform, base, with, an, abacus, decorated, with, floral, symbolic, or, animal, designs, topped, by, the, realistic, depiction, of, an, animal, thought, to, each, represent, a, traditional, direction, in, india, greek, columns, of, the, 6th, century, bce, such, as, the, sphinx, of, naxos, a, 12, 5, metre, 41, ft, ionic, column, crowned, by, a, sitting, animal, in, the, religious, centre, of, delphi, may, have, been, an, inspiration, for, the, pillars, of, ashoka, the, flame, palmette, central, decorative, element, of, the, pataliputra, pillar, is, considered, as, a, purely, greek, motif, the, first, appearance, of, flame, palmettes, goes, back, to, the, stand, alone, floral, akroteria, of, the, parthenon, 447, 432, bce, and, slightly, later, at, the, temple, of, athena, nike, flame, palmettes, were, then, introduced, into, friezes, of, floral, motifs, in, replacement, of, the, regular, palmette, flame, palmettes, are, used, extensively, in, india, floral, friezes, starting, with, the, floral, friezes, on, the, capitals, of, the, pillar, of, ashoka, and, they, are, likely, to, have, originated, with, greek, or, near, eastern, art, a, monumental, flame, palmette, can, be, seen, on, the, top, of, the, sunga, gateway, at, bharhut, lion, capital, of, ashoka, from, sarnath, the, achaemenid, conquered, and, governed, the, territories, of, the, north, western, regions, of, the, indian, subcontinent, from, the, 6th, to, 4th, centuries, bce, the, conquest, occurred, in, two, phases, the, first, invasion, was, conducted, around, 535, bce, by, cyrus, the, great, who, founded, the, achaemenid, empire, cyrus, annexed, the, regions, west, of, the, indus, river, which, formed, the, eastern, border, of, his, empire, following, the, death, of, cyrus, darius, the, great, established, his, dynasty, and, began, to, reconquer, former, provinces, and, further, expand, the, extent, of, the, empire, around, 518, bce, darius, crossed, the, himalayas, into, india, to, initiate, a, second, period, of, conquest, by, annexing, regions, up, to, the, jhelum, river, in, punjab, each, invasion, brought, in, new, style, and, soon, started, to, influence, the, art, and, architectural, styles, in, india, various, indian, artefacts, tend, to, suggest, some, perso, hellenistic, artistic, influence, in, india, mainly, felt, during, the, time, of, the, mauryan, empire, the, pataliputra, palace, with, its, pillared, hall, shows, decorative, influences, of, the, achaemenid, palaces, and, persepolis, and, may, have, used, the, help, of, foreign, craftsmen, mauryan, rulers, may, have, even, imported, craftsmen, from, abroad, to, build, royal, monuments, this, may, be, the, result, of, the, formative, influence, of, craftsmen, employed, from, persia, following, the, disintegration, of, the, achaemenid, empire, after, the, conquests, of, alexander, the, great, the, renowned, mauryan, polish, especially, used, in, the, pillars, of, ashoka, may, also, have, been, a, technique, imported, from, the, achaemenid, empire, the, similarity, of, the, 4th, century, bce, lycian, barrel, vaulted, tombs, such, as, the, tomb, of, payava, in, the, western, part, of, the, achaemenid, empire, with, the, indian, architectural, design, of, the, chaitya, starting, at, least, a, century, later, from, circa, 250, bce, with, the, lomas, rishi, caves, in, the, barabar, caves, group, suggests, that, the, designs, of, the, lycian, rock, cut, tombs, travelled, to, india, along, the, trade, routes, across, the, achaemenid, empire, early, on, james, fergusson, in, his, illustrated, handbook, of, architecture, while, describing, the, very, progressive, evolution, from, wooden, architecture, to, stone, architecture, in, various, ancient, civilizations, has, commented, that, in, india, the, form, and, construction, of, the, older, buddhist, temples, resemble, so, singularly, these, examples, in, lycia, the, structural, similarities, down, to, many, architectural, details, with, the, chaitya, type, indian, buddhist, temple, designs, such, as, the, same, pointed, form, of, roof, with, a, ridge, are, further, developed, in, the, cave, temples, of, india, the, lycian, tombs, dated, to, the, 4th, century, bce, are, either, free, standing, or, rock, cut, barrel, vaulted, sarcophagi, placed, on, a, high, base, with, architectural, features, carved, in, stone, to, imitate, wooden, structures, there, are, numerous, rock, cut, equivalents, to, the, free, standing, structures, and, decorated, with, reliefs, fergusson, went, on, to, suggest, an, indian, connection, and, some, form, of, cultural, transfer, across, the, achaemenid, empire, the, ancient, transfer, of, lycian, designs, for, rock, cut, monuments, to, india, is, considered, as, quite, probable, the, sculpture, of, the, masarh, lion, found, near, the, maurya, capital, of, pataliputra, raises, the, question, of, the, achaemenid, and, greek, influence, on, the, art, of, the, maurya, empire, and, on, the, western, origins, of, stone, carving, in, india, the, lion, is, carved, in, chunar, sandstone, like, the, pillars, of, ashoka, and, its, finish, is, polished, a, feature, of, the, maurya, sculpture, according, to, s, p, gupta, the, sculptural, style, is, unquestionably, achaemenid, this, is, particularly, the, case, for, the, well, ordered, tubular, representation, of, whiskers, vibrissas, and, the, geometrical, representation, of, inflated, veins, flush, with, the, entire, face, the, mane, on, the, other, hand, with, tufts, of, hair, represented, in, wavelets, is, rather, naturalistic, very, similar, examples, are, however, known, in, greece, and, persepolis, it, is, possible, that, this, sculpture, was, made, by, an, achaemenid, or, greek, sculptor, in, india, and, either, remained, without, effect, or, was, the, indian, imitation, of, a, greek, or, achaemenid, model, somewhere, between, the, fifth, century, bce, and, the, first, century, bce, although, it, is, generally, dated, from, the, time, of, the, maurya, empire, around, the, 3rd, century, bce
