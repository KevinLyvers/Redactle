https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugue
in, classical, music, a, fugue, f, ju, from, latin, fuga, meaning, flight, or, escape, is, a, contrapuntal, polyphonic, compositional, technique, in, two, or, more, voices, built, on, a, subject, a, musical, theme, that, is, introduced, at, the, beginning, in, imitation, repetition, at, different, pitches, which, recurs, frequently, throughout, the, course, of, the, composition, it, is, not, to, be, confused, with, a, fuguing, tune, which, is, a, style, of, song, popularized, by, and, mostly, limited, to, early, american, i, e, shape, note, or, sacred, harp, music, and, west, gallery, music, a, fugue, usually, has, three, main, sections, an, exposition, a, development, and, a, final, entry, that, contains, the, return, of, the, subject, in, the, fugue, s, tonic, key, fugues, can, also, have, episodes, which, are, parts, of, the, fugue, where, new, material, often, based, on, the, subject, is, heard, a, stretto, plural, stretti, when, the, fugue, s, subject, overlaps, itself, in, different, voices, or, a, recapitulation, a, popular, compositional, technique, in, the, baroque, era, the, fugue, was, fundamental, in, showing, mastery, of, harmony, and, tonality, as, it, presented, counterpoint, in, the, middle, ages, the, term, was, widely, used, to, denote, any, works, in, canonic, style, however, by, the, renaissance, it, had, come, to, denote, specifically, imitative, works, since, the, 17th, century, the, term, fugue, has, described, what, is, commonly, regarded, as, the, most, fully, developed, procedure, of, imitative, counterpoint, most, fugues, open, with, a, short, main, theme, called, the, subject, which, then, sounds, successively, in, each, voice, when, each, voice, has, completed, its, entry, of, the, subject, the, exposition, is, complete, this, is, often, followed, by, a, connecting, passage, or, episode, developed, from, previously, heard, material, further, entries, of, the, subject, are, then, heard, in, related, keys, episodes, if, applicable, and, entries, are, usually, alternated, until, the, final, entry, of, the, subject, at, which, point, the, music, has, returned, to, the, opening, key, or, tonic, which, is, often, followed, by, a, coda, because, of, the, composer, s, prerogative, to, decide, most, structural, elements, the, fugue, is, closer, to, a, style, of, composition, rather, than, a, structural, form, the, form, evolved, during, the, 18th, century, from, several, earlier, types, of, contrapuntal, compositions, such, as, imitative, ricercars, capriccios, canzonas, and, fantasias, the, baroque, composer, johann, sebastian, bach, 1685, 1750, well, known, for, his, fugues, shaped, his, own, works, after, those, of, jan, pieterszoon, sweelinck, 1562, 1621, johann, jakob, froberger, 1616, 1667, johann, pachelbel, 1653, 1706, girolamo, frescobaldi, 1583, 1643, dieterich, buxtehude, c, 1637, 1707, and, others, with, the, decline, of, sophisticated, styles, at, the, end, of, the, baroque, period, the, fugue, s, central, role, waned, eventually, giving, way, as, sonata, form, and, the, symphony, orchestra, rose, to, a, more, prominent, position, nevertheless, composers, continued, to, write, and, study, fugues, they, appear, in, the, works, of, wolfgang, amadeus, mozart, 1756, 1791, and, ludwig, van, beethoven, 1770, 1827, as, well, as, modern, composers, such, as, dmitri, shostakovich, 1906, 1975, and, paul, hindemith, 1895, 1963, the, english, term, fugue, originated, in, the, 16th, century, and, is, derived, from, the, french, word, fugue, or, the, italian, fuga, this, in, turn, comes, from, the, latin, fuga, which, is, itself, related, to, both, fugere, to, flee, and, fugare, to, chase, the, adjectival, form, is, fugal, variants, include, fughetta, a, small, fugue, and, fugato, a, passage, in, fugal, style, within, another, work, that, is, not, a, fugue, a, fugue, begins, with, the, exposition, and, is, written, according, to, certain, rules, the, composer, has, more, freedom, once, the, exposition, ends, though, a, logical, key, structure, is, usually, followed, further, entries, of, the, subject, will, occur, throughout, the, fugue, repeating, the, accompanying, material, at, the, same, time, and, often, accompanying, key, changes, the, various, entries, may, or, may, not, be, separated, by, episodes, or, occur, in, stretto, a, fugue, begins, with, the, exposition, of, its, subject, in, one, of, the, voices, alone, in, the, tonic, key, after, the, statement, of, the, subject, a, second, voice, enters, and, states, the, subject, with, the, subject, transposed, to, another, key, almost, always, the, dominant, or, subdominant, with, the, latter, being, less, common, which, is, known, as, the, answer, to, enable, a, natural, harmonic, progression, the, answer, may, also, be, altered, slightly, usually, by, changing, one, or, a, few, notes, near, the, beginning, when, the, answer, is, an, exact, transposition, of, the, subject, into, the, new, key, the, answer, is, classified, as, a, real, answer, alternatively, if, the, intervals, of, the, subject, are, altered, in, any, way, the, answer, is, a, tonal, answer, when, the, subject, begins, with, a, prominent, dominant, note, or, when, there, is, a, prominent, dominant, note, very, close, to, the, beginning, of, the, subject, a, tonal, answer, is, usually, necessary, to, prevent, an, undermining, of, the, fugue, s, key, this, note, is, transposed, up, a, fourth, to, the, tonic, rather, than, up, a, fifth, to, the, supertonic, for, the, same, reason, it, is, possible, for, the, answer, of, such, a, subject, to, be, in, the, subdominant, key, during, the, answer, the, voice, in, which, the, subject, was, previously, heard, accompanies, with, new, material, if, this, new, material, is, reused, in, later, statements, of, the, subject, it, is, called, a, countersubject, if, this, accompanying, material, is, only, heard, once, it, is, simply, referred, to, as, free, counterpoint, the, countersubject, is, written, in, invertible, counterpoint, at, the, octave, or, fifteenth, two, octaves, the, distinction, is, made, between, the, use, of, free, counterpoint, and, regular, countersubjects, accompanying, the, fugue, subject, answer, because, in, order, for, it, to, be, heard, accompanying, the, subject, in, more, than, one, instance, the, countersubject, must, be, capable, of, sounding, correctly, when, played, above, or, below, the, subject, and, must, be, conceived, therefore, in, invertible, double, counterpoint, in, tonal, music, invertible, contrapuntal, lines, must, be, written, according, to, certain, rules, because, several, intervallic, combinations, while, acceptable, in, one, orientation, are, not, permissible, when, inverted, as, an, example, perfect, fifths, are, contrapuntally, acceptable, while, the, inversion, of, a, perfect, fifth, results, in, a, perfect, fourth, which, unlike, the, perfect, fifth, is, considered, a, dissonance, requiring, proper, preparation, and, resolution, the, countersubject, if, sounding, at, the, same, time, as, the, answer, is, transposed, to, the, pitch, of, the, answer, each, voice, then, responds, with, its, own, subject, or, answer, and, further, countersubjects, or, free, counterpoint, may, be, heard, it, is, customary, in, the, exposition, to, alternate, entrances, of, the, subject, s, with, entrances, of, the, answer, a, however, this, order, is, occasionally, varied, for, example, the, exposition, from, j, s, bach, s, well, tempered, clavier, book, 1, fugue, no, 1, in, c, major, bwv, 846, uses, a, saas, subject, answer, answer, subject, exposition, a, brief, codetta, is, often, heard, connecting, the, various, statements, of, the, subject, and, answer, smoothly, connecting, each, and, often, facilitating, the, modulation, between, the, tonic, and, the, key, of, the, answer, the, codetta, like, other, parts, of, the, exposition, may, be, reused, throughout, the, remainder, of, the, fugue, the, first, answer, must, occur, as, soon, after, the, initial, statement, of, the, subject, as, possible, therefore, the, first, codetta, is, often, absent, or, very, short, in, the, example, shown, above, of, j, s, bach, s, fugue, no, 16, in, g, minor, bwv, 861, the, first, codetta, is, absent, the, subject, concludes, on, the, quarter, note, or, crotchet, b, of, the, third, beat, of, the, second, bar, which, harmonizes, the, opening, g, of, the, tonal, answer, the, later, codettas, may, be, considerably, longer, and, often, serve, to, develop, the, material, heard, in, the, subject, answer, and, countersubject, and, possibly, introduce, ideas, heard, in, the, second, countersubject, or, free, counterpoint, that, follows, they, may, also, be, present, to, delay, and, therefore, heighten, the, impact, of, the, reentry, of, the, subject, in, another, voice, finally, they, may, be, modulatory, passages, to, return, the, fugue, to, the, tonic, the, exposition, usually, concludes, when, all, voices, have, given, a, statement, of, the, subject, or, answer, in, some, fugues, especially, those, with, an, odd, number, of, voices, the, exposition, will, end, with, a, redundant, entry, or, an, extra, presentation, of, the, theme, in, a, voice, which, has, already, entered, furthermore, the, entry, of, one, of, the, voices, may, not, be, heard, until, considerably, later, for, example, in, j, s, bach, s, fugue, in, c, minor, for, organ, bwv, 549, the, subject, entrance, in, the, lowest, voice, played, by, the, organ, pedals, is, not, heard, until, near, the, end, of, the, fugue, further, entries, of, the, subject, may, follow, the, initial, exposition, either, immediately, or, separated, by, episodes, episodic, material, is, always, modulatory, and, is, usually, based, upon, some, musical, idea, heard, in, the, exposition, each, episode, has, the, primary, function, of, transitioning, into, a, new, key, for, the, next, entry, of, the, subject, and, may, also, provide, release, from, the, strictness, of, form, required, by, the, exposition, andr, gedalge, a, teacher, of, maurice, ravel, stated, that, the, episode, of, the, fugue, is, generally, based, on, a, series, of, imitations, of, the, subject, that, have, been, fragmented, further, entries, of, the, subject, or, middle, entries, occur, throughout, the, fugue, the, development, must, state, the, subject, or, answer, at, least, once, in, its, entirety, and, may, also, be, heard, in, combination, with, any, countersubjects, from, the, exposition, new, countersubjects, free, counterpoint, or, any, of, these, in, combination, it, is, uncommon, for, the, subject, to, enter, alone, in, a, single, voice, in, the, middle, entries, rather, it, is, usually, heard, with, at, least, one, of, the, countersubjects, and, or, other, free, contrapuntal, accompaniments, middle, entries, tend, to, occur, at, keys, other, than, the, tonic, these, are, often, closely, related, keys, such, as, the, relative, dominant, and, subdominant, although, the, key, structure, of, fugues, varies, greatly, in, the, fugues, of, j, s, bach, the, first, middle, entry, occurs, most, often, in, the, relative, major, or, minor, of, the, work, s, overall, key, and, is, followed, by, an, entry, in, the, dominant, of, the, relative, major, or, minor, when, the, fugue, s, subject, requires, a, tonal, answer, in, the, fugues, of, earlier, composers, notably, buxtehude, and, pachelbel, middle, entries, in, keys, other, than, the, tonic, and, dominant, tend, to, be, the, exception, and, non, modulation, the, norm, one, famous, example, of, such, non, modulating, fugue, occurs, in, buxtehude, s, praeludium, fugue, and, chaconne, in, c, buxwv, 137, when, there, is, no, entrance, of, the, subject, and, answer, material, the, composer, can, develop, the, subject, by, altering, it, this, is, called, a, counter, exposition, which, often, uses, the, inversion, of, the, subject, although, the, term, is, sometimes, used, synonymously, with, middle, entry, and, may, also, describe, the, exposition, of, completely, new, subjects, such, as, those, encountered, in, double, fugues, in, any, of, the, entries, within, a, fugue, the, subject, may, be, altered, by, inversion, retrograde, where, the, subject, is, heard, back, to, front, diminution, the, reduction, of, the, subject, s, rhythmic, values, by, a, certain, factor, augmentation, the, enlargement, of, the, subject, s, rhythmic, values, by, a, certain, factor, or, any, combination, thereof, the, excerpt, below, bars, 7, 12, of, j, s, bach, s, fugue, no, 2, in, c, minor, bwv, 847, from, the, well, tempered, clavier, book, 1, illustrates, the, application, of, most, of, the, characteristics, described, above, the, fugue, is, for, keyboard, and, in, three, voices, with, regular, countersubjects, this, excerpt, opens, at, last, entry, of, the, exposition, the, subject, is, sounding, in, the, bass, the, first, countersubject, in, the, treble, while, the, middle, voice, is, stating, a, second, version, of, the, second, countersubject, which, concludes, with, the, characteristic, rhythm, of, the, subject, and, is, always, used, together, with, the, first, version, of, the, second, countersubject, following, this, an, episode, modulates, from, the, tonic, to, the, relative, major, by, means, of, sequence, in, the, form, of, an, accompanied, canon, at, the, fourth, arrival, in, e, major, is, marked, by, a, quasi, perfect, cadence, across, the, bar, line, from, the, last, quarter, note, beat, of, the, first, bar, to, the, first, beat, of, the, second, bar, in, the, second, system, and, the, first, middle, entry, here, bach, has, altered, the, second, countersubject, to, accommodate, the, change, of, mode, at, any, point, in, the, fugue, there, may, be, false, entries, of, the, subject, which, include, the, start, of, the, subject, but, are, not, completed, false, entries, are, often, abbreviated, to, the, head, of, the, subject, and, anticipate, the, true, entry, of, the, subject, heightening, the, impact, of, the, subject, proper, the, counter, exposition, is, a, second, exposition, however, there, are, only, two, entries, and, the, entries, occur, in, reverse, order, the, counter, exposition, in, a, fugue, is, separated, from, the, exposition, by, an, episode, and, is, in, the, same, key, as, the, original, exposition, sometimes, counter, expositions, or, the, middle, entries, take, place, in, stretto, whereby, one, voice, responds, with, the, subject, answer, before, the, first, voice, has, completed, its, entry, of, the, subject, answer, usually, increasing, the, intensity, of, the, music, only, one, entry, of, the, subject, must, be, heard, in, its, completion, in, a, stretto, however, a, stretto, in, which, the, subject, answer, is, heard, in, completion, in, all, voices, is, known, as, stretto, maestrale, or, grand, stretto, strettos, may, also, occur, by, inversion, augmentation, and, diminution, a, fugue, in, which, the, opening, exposition, takes, place, in, stretto, form, is, known, as, a, close, fugue, or, stretto, fugue, see, for, example, the, gratias, agimus, tibi, and, dona, nobis, pacem, choruses, from, j, s, bach, s, mass, in, b, minor, the, closing, section, of, a, fugue, often, includes, one, or, two, counter, expositions, and, possibly, a, stretto, in, the, tonic, sometimes, over, a, tonic, or, dominant, pedal, note, any, material, that, follows, the, final, entry, of, the, subject, is, considered, to, be, the, final, coda, and, is, normally, cadential, a, simple, fugue, has, only, one, subject, and, does, not, utilize, invertible, counterpoint, a, double, fugue, has, two, subjects, that, are, often, developed, simultaneously, similarly, a, triple, fugue, has, three, subjects, there, are, two, kinds, of, double, triple, fugue, a, a, fugue, in, which, the, second, third, subject, is, are, presented, simultaneously, with, the, subject, in, the, exposition, e, g, as, in, kyrie, eleison, of, mozart, s, requiem, in, d, minor, or, the, fugue, of, bach, s, passacaglia, and, fugue, in, c, minor, bwv, 582, and, b, a, fugue, in, which, all, subjects, have, their, own, expositions, at, some, point, and, they, are, not, combined, until, later, see, for, example, the, three, subject, fugue, no, 14, in, f, minor, from, bach, s, well, tempered, clavier, book, 2, or, more, famously, bach, s, st, anne, fugue, in, e, major, bwv, 552, a, triple, fugue, for, organ, a, counter, fugue, is, a, fugue, in, which, the, first, answer, is, presented, as, the, subject, in, inversion, upside, down, and, the, inverted, subject, continues, to, feature, prominently, throughout, the, fugue, examples, include, contrapunctus, v, through, contrapunctus, vii, from, bach, s, the, art, of, fugue, during, the, baroque, period, counter, fugues, were, sometimes, called, by, the, latin, name, fuga, contraria, german, composer, johann, mattheson, coined, the, term, gegenfuge, to, refer, to, a, counter, fugue, construct, in, his, der, vollkommene, capellmeister, 1739, and, some, german, language, texts, use, that, name, to, refer, to, a, counter, fugue, permutation, fugue, describes, a, type, of, composition, or, technique, of, composition, in, which, elements, of, fugue, and, strict, canon, are, combined, each, voice, enters, in, succession, with, the, subject, each, entry, alternating, between, tonic, and, dominant, and, each, voice, having, stated, the, initial, subject, continues, by, stating, two, or, more, themes, or, countersubjects, which, must, be, conceived, in, correct, invertible, counterpoint, in, other, words, the, subject, and, countersubjects, must, be, capable, of, being, played, both, above, and, below, all, the, other, themes, without, creating, any, unacceptable, dissonances, each, voice, takes, this, pattern, and, states, all, the, subjects, themes, in, the, same, order, and, repeats, the, material, when, all, the, themes, have, been, stated, sometimes, after, a, rest, there, is, usually, very, little, non, structural, thematic, material, during, the, course, of, a, permutation, fugue, it, is, quite, uncommon, actually, for, every, single, possible, voice, combination, or, permutation, of, the, themes, to, be, heard, this, limitation, exists, in, consequence, of, sheer, proportionality, the, more, voices, in, a, fugue, the, greater, the, number, of, possible, permutations, in, consequence, composers, exercise, editorial, judgment, as, to, the, most, musical, of, permutations, and, processes, leading, thereto, one, example, of, permutation, fugue, can, be, seen, in, the, eighth, and, final, chorus, of, j, s, bach, s, cantata, himmelsk, nig, sei, willkommen, bwv, 182, permutation, fugues, differ, from, conventional, fugue, in, that, there, are, no, connecting, episodes, nor, statement, of, the, themes, in, related, keys, so, for, example, the, fugue, of, bach, s, passacaglia, and, fugue, in, c, minor, bwv, 582, is, not, purely, a, permutation, fugue, as, it, does, have, episodes, between, permutation, expositions, invertible, counterpoint, is, essential, to, permutation, fugues, but, is, not, found, in, simple, fugues, a, fughetta, is, a, short, fugue, that, has, the, same, characteristics, as, a, fugue, often, the, contrapuntal, writing, is, not, strict, and, the, setting, less, formal, see, for, example, variation, 24, of, beethoven, s, diabelli, variations, op, 120, the, term, fuga, was, used, as, far, back, as, the, middle, ages, but, was, initially, used, to, refer, to, any, kind, of, imitative, counterpoint, including, canons, which, are, now, thought, of, as, distinct, from, fugues, prior, to, the, 16th, century, fugue, was, originally, a, genre, it, was, not, until, the, 16th, century, that, fugal, technique, as, it, is, understood, today, began, to, be, seen, in, pieces, both, instrumental, and, vocal, fugal, writing, is, found, in, works, such, as, fantasias, ricercares, and, canzonas, fugue, as, a, theoretical, term, first, occurred, in, 1330, when, jacobus, of, liege, wrote, about, the, fuga, in, his, speculum, musicae, the, fugue, arose, from, the, technique, of, imitation, where, the, same, musical, material, was, repeated, starting, on, a, different, note, gioseffo, zarlino, a, composer, author, and, theorist, in, the, renaissance, was, one, of, the, first, to, distinguish, between, the, two, types, of, imitative, counterpoint, fugues, and, canons, which, he, called, imitations, originally, this, was, to, aid, improvisation, but, by, the, 1550s, it, was, considered, a, technique, of, composition, the, composer, giovanni, pierluigi, da, palestrina, 1525, 1594, wrote, masses, using, modal, counterpoint, and, imitation, and, fugal, writing, became, the, basis, for, writing, motets, as, well, palestrina, s, imitative, motets, differed, from, fugues, in, that, each, phrase, of, the, text, had, a, different, subject, which, was, introduced, and, worked, out, separately, whereas, a, fugue, continued, working, with, the, same, subject, or, subjects, throughout, the, entire, length, of, the, piece, it, was, in, the, baroque, period, that, the, writing, of, fugues, became, central, to, composition, in, part, as, a, demonstration, of, compositional, expertise, jan, pieterszoon, sweelinck, girolamo, frescobaldi, johann, jakob, froberger, and, dieterich, buxtehude, all, wrote, fugues, fugues, were, incorporated, into, a, variety, of, musical, genres, and, are, found, in, most, of, george, frideric, handel, s, oratorios, keyboard, suites, from, this, time, often, conclude, with, a, fugal, gigue, domenico, scarlatti, has, only, a, few, fugues, among, his, corpus, of, over, 500, harpsichord, sonatas, the, french, overture, featured, a, quick, fugal, section, after, a, slow, introduction, the, second, movement, of, a, sonata, da, chiesa, as, written, by, arcangelo, corelli, and, others, was, usually, fugal, the, baroque, period, also, saw, a, rise, in, the, importance, of, music, theory, some, fugues, during, the, baroque, period, were, pieces, designed, to, teach, contrapuntal, technique, to, students, the, most, influential, text, was, johann, joseph, fux, s, gradus, ad, parnassum, steps, to, parnassus, which, appeared, in, 1725, this, work, laid, out, the, terms, of, species, of, counterpoint, and, offered, a, series, of, exercises, to, learn, fugue, writing, fux, s, work, was, largely, based, on, the, practice, of, palestrina, s, modal, fugues, mozart, studied, from, this, book, and, it, remained, influential, into, the, nineteenth, century, haydn, for, example, taught, counterpoint, from, his, own, summary, of, fux, and, thought, of, it, as, the, basis, for, formal, structure, bach, s, most, famous, fugues, are, those, for, the, harpsichord, in, the, well, tempered, clavier, which, many, composers, and, theorists, look, at, as, the, greatest, model, of, fugue, the, well, tempered, clavier, comprises, two, volumes, written, in, different, times, of, bach, s, life, each, comprising, 24, prelude, and, fugue, pairs, one, for, each, major, and, minor, key, bach, is, also, known, for, his, organ, fugues, which, are, usually, preceded, by, a, prelude, or, toccata, the, art, of, fugue, bwv, 1080, is, a, collection, of, fugues, and, four, canons, on, a, single, theme, that, is, gradually, transformed, as, the, cycle, progresses, bach, also, wrote, smaller, single, fugues, and, put, fugal, sections, or, movements, into, many, of, his, more, general, works, j, s, bach, s, influence, extended, forward, through, his, son, c, p, e, bach, and, through, the, theorist, friedrich, wilhelm, marpurg, 1718, 1795, whose, abhandlung, von, der, fuge, treatise, on, the, fugue, 1753, was, largely, based, on, j, s, bach, s, work, during, the, classical, era, the, fugue, was, no, longer, a, central, or, even, fully, natural, mode, of, musical, composition, nevertheless, both, haydn, and, mozart, had, periods, of, their, careers, in, which, they, in, some, sense, rediscovered, fugal, writing, and, used, it, frequently, in, their, work, joseph, haydn, was, the, leader, of, fugal, composition, and, technique, in, the, classical, era, haydn, s, most, famous, fugues, can, be, found, in, his, sun, quartets, op, 20, 1772, of, which, three, have, fugal, finales, this, was, a, practice, that, haydn, repeated, only, once, later, in, his, quartet, writing, career, with, the, finale, of, his, string, quartet, op, 50, no, 4, 1787, some, of, the, earliest, examples, of, haydn, s, use, of, counterpoint, however, are, in, three, symphonies, no, 3, no, 13, and, no, 40, that, date, from, 1762, to, 1763, the, earliest, fugues, in, both, the, symphonies, and, in, the, baryton, trios, exhibit, the, influence, of, joseph, fux, s, treatise, on, counterpoint, gradus, ad, parnassum, 1725, which, haydn, studied, carefully, haydn, s, second, fugal, period, occurred, after, he, heard, and, was, greatly, inspired, by, the, oratorios, of, handel, during, his, visits, to, london, 1791, 1793, 1794, 1795, haydn, then, studied, handel, s, techniques, and, incorporated, handelian, fugal, writing, into, the, choruses, of, his, mature, oratorios, the, creation, and, the, seasons, as, well, as, several, of, his, later, symphonies, including, no, 88, no, 95, and, no, 101, and, the, late, string, quartets, opus, 71, no, 3, and, especially, opus, 76, no, 6, the, young, wolfgang, amadeus, mozart, studied, counterpoint, with, padre, martini, in, bologna, under, the, employment, of, archbishop, colloredo, and, the, musical, influence, of, his, predecessors, and, colleagues, such, as, johann, ernst, eberlin, anton, cajetan, adlgasser, michael, haydn, and, his, own, father, leopold, mozart, at, the, salzburg, cathedral, the, young, mozart, composed, ambitious, fugues, and, contrapuntal, passages, in, catholic, choral, works, such, as, mass, in, c, minor, k, 139, waisenhaus, 1768, mass, in, c, major, k, 66, dominicus, 1769, mass, in, c, major, k, 167, in, honorem, sanctissimae, trinitatis, 1773, mass, in, c, major, k, 262, missa, longa, 1775, mass, in, c, major, k, 337, solemnis, 1780, various, litanies, and, vespers, leopold, admonished, his, son, openly, in, 1777, that, he, not, forget, to, make, public, demonstration, of, his, abilities, in, fugue, canon, and, contrapunctus, later, in, life, the, major, impetus, to, fugal, writing, for, mozart, was, the, influence, of, baron, gottfried, van, swieten, in, vienna, around, 1782, van, swieten, during, diplomatic, service, in, berlin, had, taken, the, opportunity, to, collect, as, many, manuscripts, by, bach, and, handel, as, he, could, and, he, invited, mozart, to, study, his, collection, and, encouraged, him, to, transcribe, various, works, for, other, combinations, of, instruments, mozart, was, evidently, fascinated, by, these, works, and, wrote, a, set, of, five, transcriptions, for, string, quartet, k, 405, 1782, of, fugues, from, bach, s, well, tempered, clavier, introducing, them, with, preludes, of, his, own, in, a, letter, to, his, sister, nannerl, mozart, dated, in, vienna, on, 20, april, 1782, mozart, recognizes, that, he, had, not, written, anything, in, this, form, but, moved, by, his, wife, s, interest, he, composed, one, piece, which, is, sent, with, the, letter, he, begs, her, not, to, let, anybody, see, the, fugue, and, manifests, the, hope, to, write, five, more, and, then, present, them, to, baron, van, swieten, regarding, the, piece, he, said, i, have, taken, particular, care, to, write, andante, maestoso, upon, it, so, that, it, should, not, be, played, fast, for, if, a, fugue, is, not, played, slowly, the, ear, cannot, clearly, distinguish, the, new, subject, as, it, is, introduced, and, the, effect, is, missed, mozart, then, set, to, writing, fugues, on, his, own, mimicking, the, baroque, style, these, included, a, fugue, in, c, minor, k, 426, for, two, pianos, 1783, later, mozart, incorporated, fugal, writing, into, his, opera, die, zauberfl, te, and, the, finale, of, his, symphony, no, 41, the, parts, of, the, requiem, he, completed, also, contain, several, fugues, most, notably, the, kyrie, and, the, three, fugues, in, the, domine, jesu, he, also, left, behind, a, sketch, for, an, amen, fugue, which, some, believe, would, have, come, at, the, end, of, the, sequentia, ludwig, van, beethoven, was, familiar, with, fugal, writing, from, childhood, as, an, important, part, of, his, training, was, playing, from, the, well, tempered, clavier, during, his, early, career, in, vienna, beethoven, attracted, notice, for, his, performance, of, these, fugues, there, are, fugal, sections, in, beethoven, s, early, piano, sonatas, and, fugal, writing, is, to, be, found, in, the, second, and, fourth, movements, of, the, eroica, symphony, 1805, beethoven, incorporated, fugues, in, his, sonatas, and, reshaped, the, episode, s, purpose, and, compositional, technique, for, later, generations, of, composers, nevertheless, fugues, did, not, take, on, a, truly, central, role, in, beethoven, s, work, until, his, late, period, the, finale, of, beethoven, s, hammerklavier, sonata, contains, a, fugue, which, was, practically, unperformed, until, the, late, 19th, century, due, to, its, tremendous, technical, difficulty, and, length, the, last, movement, of, his, cello, sonata, op, 102, no, 2, is, a, fugue, and, there, are, fugal, passages, in, the, last, movements, of, his, piano, sonatas, in, a, major, op, 101, and, a, major, op, 110, according, to, charles, rosen, with, the, finale, of, 110, beethoven, re, conceived, the, significance, of, the, most, traditional, elements, of, fugue, writing, fugal, passages, are, also, found, in, the, missa, solemnis, and, all, movements, of, the, ninth, symphony, except, the, third, a, massive, dissonant, fugue, forms, the, finale, of, his, string, quartet, op, 130, 1825, the, latter, was, later, published, separately, as, op, 133, the, gro, e, fuge, great, fugue, however, it, is, the, fugue, that, opens, beethoven, s, string, quartet, in, c, minor, op, 131, that, several, commentators, regard, as, one, of, the, composer, s, greatest, achievements, joseph, kerman, 1966, p, 330, calls, it, this, most, moving, of, all, fugues, j, w, n, sullivan, 1927, p, 235, hears, it, as, the, most, superhuman, piece, of, music, that, beethoven, has, ever, written, philip, radcliffe, 1965, p, 149, says, bare, description, of, its, formal, outline, can, give, but, little, idea, of, the, extraordinary, profundity, of, this, fugue, by, the, beginning, of, the, romantic, era, fugue, writing, had, become, specifically, attached, to, the, norms, and, styles, of, the, baroque, felix, mendelssohn, wrote, many, fugues, inspired, by, his, study, of, the, music, of, johann, sebastian, bach, johannes, brahms, variations, and, fugue, on, a, theme, by, handel, op, 24, is, a, work, for, solo, piano, written, in, 1861, it, consists, of, a, set, of, twenty, five, variations, and, a, concluding, fugue, all, based, on, a, theme, from, george, frideric, handel, s, harpsichord, suite, no, 1, in, b, major, hwv, 434, franz,

choral, fugues, anton, bruckner, and, gustav, mahler, also, included, them, in, their, respective, symphonies, the, exposition, of, the, finale, of, bruckner, s, symphony, no, 5, begins, with, a, fugal, exposition, the, exposition, ends, with, a, chorale, the, melody, of, which, is, then, used, as, a, second, fugal, exposition, at, the, beginning, of, the, development, the, recapitulation, features, both, fugal, subjects, concurrently, the, finale, of, mahler, s, symphony, no, 5, features, a, fugue, like, passage, early, in, the, movement, though, this, is, not, actually, an, example, of, a, fugue, twentieth, century, composers, brought, fugue, back, to, its, position, of, prominence, realizing, its, uses, in, full, instrumental, works, its, importance, in, development, and, introductory, sections, and, the, developmental, capabilities, of, fugal, composition, the, second, movement, of, maurice, ravel, s, piano, suite, le, tombeau, de, couperin, 1917, is, a, fugue, that, roy, howat, 200, p, 88, describes, as, having, a, subtle, glint, of, jazz, b, la, bart, k, s, music, for, strings, percussion, and, celesta, 1936, opens, with, a, slow, fugue, that, pierre, boulez, 1986, pp, 346, 47, regards, as, certainly, the, finest, and, most, characteristic, example, of, bart, k, s, subtle, style, probably, the, most, timeless, of, all, bart, k, s, works, a, fugue, that, unfolds, like, a, fan, to, a, point, of, maximum, intensity, and, then, closes, returning, to, the, mysterious, atmosphere, of, the, opening, the, second, movement, of, bart, k, s, sonata, for, solo, violin, is, a, fugue, and, the, first, movement, of, his, sonata, for, two, pianos, and, percussion, contains, a, fugato, schwanda, the, bagpiper, czech, vanda, dud, k, written, in, 1926, an, opera, in, two, acts, five, scenes, with, music, by, jarom, r, weinberger, includes, a, polka, followed, by, a, powerful, fugue, based, on, the, polka, theme, igor, stravinsky, also, incorporated, fugues, into, his, works, including, the, symphony, of, psalms, and, the, dumbarton, oaks, concerto, stravinsky, recognized, the, compositional, techniques, of, bach, and, in, the, second, movement, of, his, symphony, of, psalms, 1930, he, lays, out, a, fugue, that, is, much, like, that, of, the, baroque, era, it, employs, a, double, fugue, with, two, distinct, subjects, the, first, beginning, in, c, and, the, second, in, e, techniques, such, as, stretto, sequencing, and, the, use, of, subject, incipits, are, frequently, heard, in, the, movement, dmitri, shostakovich, s, 24, preludes, and, fugues, is, the, composer, s, homage, to, bach, s, two, volumes, of, the, well, tempered, clavier, in, the, first, movement, of, his, fourth, symphony, starting, at, rehearsal, mark, 63, is, a, gigantic, fugue,

which, each, part, smatb, is, subdivided, in, four, voice, bundles, that, make, a, canon, the, melodic, material, in, this, fugue, is, totally, chromatic, with, melismatic, running, parts, overlaid, onto, skipping, intervals, and, use, of, polyrhythm, multiple, simultaneous, subdivisions, of, the, measure, blurring, everything, both, harmonically, and, rhythmically, so, as, to, create, an, aural, aggregate, thus, highlighting, the, theoretical, aesthetic, question, of, the, next, section, as, to, whether, fugue, is, a, form, or, a, texture, according, to, tom, service, in, this, work, ligeti, takes, the, logic, of, the, fugal, idea, and, creates, something, that, s, meticulously, built, on, precise, contrapuntal, principles, of, imitation, and, fugality, but, he, expands, them, into, a, different, region, of, musical, experience, ligeti, doesn, t, want, us, to, hear, individual, entries, of, the, subject, or, any, subject, or, to, allow, us, access, to, the, labyrinth, through, listening, in, to, individual, lines, he, creates, instead, a, vastly, dense, texture, of, voices, in, his, choir, and, orchestra, a, huge, stratified, slab, of, terrifying, visionary, power, yet, this, is, music, that, s, made, with, a, fine, craft, and, detail, of, a, swiss, clock, maker, ligeti, s, so, called, micro, polyphony, the, many, voicedness, of, small, intervals, at, small, distances, in, time, from, one, another, is, a, kind, of, conjuring, trick, at, the, micro, level, of, the, individual, lines, and, there, are, dozens, and, dozens, of, them, in, this, music, there, s, an, astonishing, detail, and, finesse, but, the, overall, macro, effect, is, a, huge, overwhelming, and, singular, experience, benjamin, britten, used, a, fugue, in, the, final, part, of, the,

gould, composed, so, you, want, to, write, a, fugue, a, full, scale, fugue, set, to, a, text, that, cleverly, explicates, its, own, musical, form, fugues, or, fughettas, fugatos, have, been, incorporated, into, genres, outside, western, classical, music, several, examples, exist, within, jazz, such, as, bach, goes, to, town, composed, by, the, welsh, composer, alec, templeton, and, recorded, by, benny, goodman, in, 1938, and, concorde, composed, by, john, lewis, and, recorded, by, the, modern, jazz, quartet, in, 1955, in, fugue, for, tinhorns, from, the, broadway, musical, guys, and, dolls, written, by, frank, loesser, the, characters, nicely, nicely, benny, and, rusty, sing, simultaneously, about, hot, tips, they, each, have, in, an, upcoming, horse, race, in, west, side,

central, movement, of, the, endless, enigma, by, emerson, lake, palmer, and, on, reflection, by, gentle, giant, on, their, ep, of, the, same, name, vulfpeck, has, a, composition, called, fugue, state, which, incorporates, a, fugue, like, section, between, theo, katzman, guitar, joe, dart, bass, and, woody, goss, wurlitzer, keyboard, the, composer, matyas, seiber, included, an, atonal, or, twelve, tone, fugue, for, flute, trumpet, and, string, quartet, in, his, score, for, the, 1953, film, graham, sutherland, the, film, composer, john, williams, includes, a, fugue, in, his, score, for, the, 1990, film, home, alone, at, the, point, where, kevin, accidentally, left, at, home, by, his, family, and, realizing, he, is, about, to, be, attacked, by, a, pair, of, bumbling, burglars, begins, to, plan, his, elaborate, defenses, another, fugue, occurs, at, a, similar, point, in, the, 1992, sequel, film, home, alone, 2, lost, in, new, york, the, jazz, composer, and, film, composer, michel, legrand, includes, a, fugue, as, the, climax, of, his, score, a, classical, theme, with, variations, and, fugue, for, joseph, losey, s, 1972, film, the, go, between, based, on, the, 1953, novel, by, british, novelist, l, p, hartley, as, well, as, several, times, in, his, score, for, jacques, demy, s, 1970, film, peau, d, ne, a, widespread, view, of, the, fugue, is, that, it, is, not, a, musical, form, but, rather, a, technique, of, composition, the, austrian, musicologist, erwin, ratz, argues, that, the, formal, organization, of, a, fugue, involves, not, only, the, arrangement, of, its, theme, and, episodes, but, also, its, harmonic, structure, in, particular, the, exposition, and, coda, tend, to, emphasize, the, tonic, key, whereas, the, episodes, usually, explore, more, distant, tonalities, ratz, stressed, however, that, this, is, the, core, underlying, form, urform, of, the, fugue, from, which, individual, fugues, may, deviate, although, certain, related, keys, are, more, commonly, explored, in, fugal, development, the, overall, structure, of, a, fugue, does, not, limit, its, harmonic, structure, for, example, a, fugue, may, not, even, explore, the, dominant, one, of, the, most, closely, related, keys, to, the, tonic, bach, s, fugue, in, b, major, from, book, 1, of, the, well, tempered, clavier, explores, the, relative, minor, the, supertonic, and, the, subdominant, this, is, unlike, later, forms, such, as, the, sonata, which, clearly, prescribes, which, keys, are, explored, typically, the, tonic, and, dominant, in, an, aba, form, then, many, modern, fugues, dispense, with, traditional, tonal, harmonic, scaffolding, altogether, and, either, use, serial, pitch, oriented, rules, or, as, the, kyrie, christe, in, gy, rgy, ligeti, s, requiem, witold, lutos, awski, works, use, panchromatic, or, even, denser, harmonic, spectra, the, fugue, is, the, most, complex, of, contrapuntal, forms, in, ratz, s, words, fugal, technique, significantly, burdens, the, shaping, of, musical, ideas, and, it, was, given, only, to, the, greatest, geniuses, such, as, bach, and, beethoven, to, breathe, life, into, such, an, unwieldy, form, and, make, it, the, bearer, of, the, highest, thoughts, in, presenting, bach, s, fugues, as, among, the, greatest, of, contrapuntal, works, peter, kivy, points, out, that, counterpoint, itself, since, time, out, of, mind, has, been, associated, in, the, thinking, of, musicians, with, the, profound, and, the, serious, and, argues, that, there, seems, to, be, some, rational, justification, for, their, doing, so, this, is, related, to, the, idea, that, restrictions, create, freedom, for, the, composer, by, directing, their, efforts, he, also, points, out, that, fugal, writing, has, its, roots, in, improvisation, and, was, during, the, renaissance, practiced, as, an, improvisatory, art, writing, in, 1555, nicola, vicentino, for, example, suggests, that, the, composer, having, completed, the, initial, imitative, entrances, take, the, passage, which, has, served, as, accompaniment, to, the, theme, and, make, it, the, basis, for, new, imitative, treatment, so, that, he, will, always, have, material, with, which, to, compose, without, having, to, stop, and, reflect, this, formulation, of, the, basic, rule, for, fugal, improvisation, anticipates, later, sixteenth, century, discussions, which, deal, with, the, improvisational, technique, at, the, keyboard, more, extensively
