the, global, film, industry, since, the, early, 20th, century, the, dominant, style, of, american, cinema, is, classical, hollywood, cinema, which, developed, from, 1910, to, 1962, and, is, still, typical, of, most, films, made, there, to, this, day, while, frenchmen, auguste, and, louis, lumi, re, are, generally, credited, with, the, birth, of, modern, cinema, american, cinema, soon, came, to, be, a, dominant, force, in, the, emerging, industry, with, more, than, 600, english, language, films, released, on, average, every, year, as, of, 2017, it, produced, the, fourth, largest, number, of, films, of, any, national, cinema, after, india, japan, and, china, while, the, national, cinemas, of, the, united, kingdom, canada, australia, and, new, zealand, also, produce, films, in, the, same, language, they, are, not, part, of, the, hollywood, system, because, of, this, hollywood, has, also, been, considered, a, transnational, cinema, and, has, produced, multiple, language, versions, of, some, titles, often, in, spanish, or, french, contemporary, hollywood, often, outsources, production, to, the, united, kingdom, canada, australia, and, new, zealand, the, major, film, studios, of, hollywood, are, the, primary, source, of, the, most, commercially, successful, and, most, ticket, selling, movies, in, the, world, hollywood, is, considered, to, be, the, oldest, film, industry, in, the, sense, of, being, the, place, where, the, earliest, film, studios, and, production, companies, emerged, it, is, the, birthplace, of, various, genres, of, cinema, among, them, comedy, drama, action, the, musical, romance, horror, science, fiction, and, the, epic, and, has, set, the, example, for, other, national, film, industries, during, 1878, eadweard, muybridge, demonstrated, the, power, of, photography, to, capture, motion, in, 1894, the, world, s, first, commercial, motion, picture, exhibition, was, given, in, new, york, city, using, thomas, edison, s, kinetoscope, in, the, following, decades, production, of, silent, film, greatly, expanded, studios, formed, and, migrated, to, california, and, films, and, the, stories, they, told, became, much, longer, the, united, states, produced, the, world, s, first, sync, sound, musical, film, the, jazz, singer, in, 1927, and, was, at, the, forefront, of, sound, film, development, in, the, following, decades, since, the, early, 20th, century, the, u, s, film, industry, has, primarily, been, based, in, and, around, the, thirty, mile, zone, centered, in, the, hollywood, neighborhood, of, los, angeles, county, california, director, d, w, griffith, was, central, to, the, development, of, a, film, grammar, orson, welles, s, citizen, kane, 1941, is, frequently, cited, in, critics, polls, as, the, greatest, film, of, all, time, many, of, hollywood, s, highest, grossing, movies, have, generated, more, box, office, revenue, and, ticket, sales, outside, the, united, states, than, films, made, elsewhere, the, united, states, is, a, leading, pioneer, in, motion, picture, engineering, and, technology, the, first, recorded, instance, of, photographs, capturing, and, reproducing, motion, was, a, series, of, photographs, of, a, running, horse, by, eadweard, muybridge, which, he, took, in, palo, alto, california, using, a, set, of, still, cameras, placed, in, a, row, muybridge, s, accomplishment, led, inventors, everywhere, to, attempt, to, make, similar, devices, in, the, united, states, thomas, edison, was, among, the, first, to, produce, such, a, device, the, kinetoscope, the, history, of, cinema, in, the, united, states, can, trace, its, roots, to, the, east, coast, where, at, one, time, fort, lee, new, jersey, was, the, motion, picture, capital, of, america, the, industry, got, its, start, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, with, the, construction, of, thomas, edison, s, black, maria, the, first, motion, picture, studio, in, west, orange, new, jersey, the, cities, and, towns, on, the, hudson, river, and, hudson, palisades, offered, land, at, costs, considerably, less, than, new, york, city, across, the, river, and, benefited, greatly, as, a, result, of, the, phenomenal, growth, of, the, film, industry, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, the, industry, began, attracting, both, capital, and, an, innovative, workforce, in, 1907, when, the, kalem, company, began, using, fort, lee, as, a, location, for, filming, in, the, area, other, filmmakers, quickly, followed, in, 1909, a, forerunner, of, universal, studios, the, champion, film, company, built, the, first, studio, others, quickly, followed, and, either, built, new, studios, or, leased, facilities, in, fort, lee, in, the, 1910s, and, 1920s, film, companies, such, as, the, independent, moving, pictures, company, peerless, studios, the, solax, company, clair, studios, goldwyn, picture, corporation, american, m, li, s, star, films, world, film, company, biograph, studios, fox, film, corporation, path, fr, res, metro, pictures, corporation, victor, film, company, and, selznick, pictures, corporation, were, all, making, pictures, in, fort, lee, such, notables, as, mary, pickford, got, their, start, at, biograph, studios, in, new, york, the, kaufman, astoria, studios, in, queens, which, was, built, during, the, silent, film, era, was, used, by, the, marx, brothers, and, w, c, fields, the, edison, studios, were, located, in, the, bronx, chelsea, manhattan, was, also, frequently, used, other, eastern, cities, most, notably, chicago, and, cleveland, also, served, as, early, centers, for, film, production, in, the, west, california, was, already, quickly, emerging, as, a, major, film, production, center, in, colorado, denver, was, home, to, the, art, o, graf, film, company, and, walt, disney, s, early, laugh, o, gram, animation, studio, was, based, in, kansas, city, missouri, from, 1908, jacksonville, florida, s, motion, picture, industry, saw, more, than, 30, silent, film, companies, establish, studios, in, town, including, kalem, studios, metro, pictures, later, mgm, edison, studios, majestic, films, king, bee, film, company, vim, comedy, company, norman, studios, gaumont, studios, and, the, lubin, manufacturing, company, picture, city, florida, was, a, planned, site, for, a, movie, picture, production, center, in, the, 1920s, but, due, to, the, 1928, okeechobee, hurricane, the, idea, collapsed, and, picture, city, returned, to, its, original, name, of, hobe, sound, an, attempt, to, establish, a, film, production, center, in, detroit, also, proved, unsuccessful, the, film, patents, wars, of, the, early, 20th, century, helped, facilitate, the, spread, of, film, companies, to, other, parts, of, the, us, outside, new, york, many, filmmakers, worked, with, equipment, for, which, they, did, not, own, the, rights, to, use, therefore, filming, in, new, york, could, be, dangerous, as, it, was, close, to, edison, s, company, headquarters, and, close, to, the, agents, who, the, company, set, out, to, seize, cameras, an, alternative, was, los, angeles, which, had, mild, winters, a, large, selection, of, places, to, film, and, most, importantly, it, was, only, 90, miles, to, the, border, of, mexico, in, case, they, needed, to, run, if, edison, s, enforcement, agents, found, them, by, 1912, most, major, film, companies, had, set, up, production, facilities, in, southern, california, near, or, in, los, angeles, because, of, the, region, s, favorable, year, round, weather, the, 1908, selig, polyscope, company, production, of, the, count, of, monte, cristo, directed, by, francis, boggs, and, starring, hobart, bosworth, was, claimed, as, the, first, to, have, been, filmed, in, los, angeles, in, 1907, with, a, plaque, being, unveiled, by, the, city, in, 1957, at, dearden, s, flagship, store, on, the, corner, of, main, street, and, 7th, street, to, mark, the, filming, on, the, site, when, it, had, been, a, chinese, laundry, bosworth, s, widow, suggested, the, city, had, got, the, date, and, location, wrong, and, that, the, film, was, actually, shot, in, nearby, venice, which, at, the, time, was, an, independent, city, boggs, in, the, sultan, s, power, for, selig, polyscope, also, starring, bosworth, is, considered, the, first, film, shot, entirely, in, los, angeles, with, shooting, at, 7th, and, olive, streets, in, 1909, in, early, 1910, director, d, w, griffith, was, sent, by, the, biograph, company, to, the, west, coast, with, his, acting, troupe, consisting, of, actors, blanche, sweet, lillian, gish, mary, pickford, lionel, barrymore, and, others, they, started, filming, on, a, vacant, lot, near, georgia, street, in, downtown, los, angeles, while, there, the, company, decided, to, explore, new, territories, traveling, several, miles, north, to, hollywood, a, little, village, that, was, friendly, and, enjoyed, the, movie, company, filming, there, griffith, then, filmed, the, first, movie, ever, shot, in, hollywood, in, old, california, a, biograph, melodrama, about, california, in, the, 19th, century, when, it, belonged, to, mexico, griffith, stayed, there, for, months, and, made, several, films, before, returning, to, new, york, also, in, 1910, selig, poly, scope, of, chicago, established, the, first, film, studio, in, the, los, angeles, area, in, edendale, and, the, first, studio, in, hollywood, opened, in, 1912, 447, after, hearing, about, griffith, s, success, in, hollywood, in, 1913, many, movie, makers, headed, west, to, avoid, the, fees, imposed, by, thomas, edison, who, owned, patents, on, the, movie, making, process, nestor, studios, of, bayonne, new, jersey, built, the, first, studio, in, the, hollywood, neighborhood, in, 1911, nestor, studios, owned, by, david, and, william, horsley, later, merged, with, universal, studios, and, william, horsley, s, other, company, hollywood, film, laboratory, is, now, the, oldest, existing, company, in, hollywood, now, called, the, hollywood, digital, laboratory, california, s, more, hospitable, and, cost, effective, climate, led, to, the, eventual, shift, of, virtually, all, filmmaking, to, the, west, coast, by, the, 1930s, at, the, time, thomas, edison, owned, almost, all, the, patents, relevant, to, motion, picture, production, and, movie, producers, on, the, east, coast, acting, independently, of, edison, s, motion, picture, patents, company, were, often, sued, or, enjoined, by, edison, and, his, agents, while, movie, makers, working, on, the, west, coast, could, work, independently, of, edison, s, control, in, los, angeles, the, studios, and, hollywood, grew, before, world, war, i, films, were, made, in, several, american, cities, but, filmmakers, tended, to, gravitate, towards, southern, california, as, the, industry, developed, they, were, attracted, by, the, warm, climate, and, reliable, sunlight, which, made, it, possible, to, film, their, films, outdoors, year, round, and, by, the, varied, scenery, that, was, available, war, damage, contributed, to, the, decline, of, the, then, dominant, european, film, industry, in, favor, of, the, united, states, where, infrastructure, was, still, intact, the, stronger, early, public, health, response, to, the, 1918, flu, epidemic, by, los, angeles, compared, to, other, american, cities, reduced, the, number, of, cases, there, and, resulted, in, a, faster, recovery, contributing, to, the, increasing, dominance, of, hollywood, over, new, york, city, during, the, pandemic, public, health, officials, temporarily, closed, movie, theaters, in, some, jurisdictions, large, studios, suspended, production, for, weeks, at, a, time, and, some, actors, came, down, with, the, flu, this, caused, major, financial, losses, and, severe, difficulties, for, small, studios, but, the, industry, as, a, whole, more, than, recovered, during, the, roaring, twenties, in, the, early, 20th, century, when, the, medium, was, new, many, jewish, immigrants, found, employment, in, the, us, film, industry, they, were, able, to, make, their, mark, in, a, brand, new, business, the, exhibition, of, short, films, in, storefront, theaters, called, nickelodeons, after, their, admission, price, of, a, nickel, five, cents, within, a, few, years, ambitious, men, like, samuel, goldwyn, william, fox, carl, laemmle, adolph, zukor, louis, b, mayer, and, the, warner, brothers, harry, albert, samuel, and, jack, had, switched, to, the, production, side, of, the, business, soon, they, were, the, heads, of, a, new, kind, of, enterprise, the, movie, studio, the, us, had, at, least, two, female, directors, producers, and, studio, heads, in, these, early, years, lois, weber, and, french, born, alice, guy, blach, they, also, set, the, stage, for, the, industry, s, internationalism, the, industry, is, often, accused, of, amero, centric, provincialism, other, moviemakers, arrived, from, europe, after, world, war, i, directors, like, ernst, lubitsch, alfred, hitchcock, fritz, lang, and, jean, renoir, and, actors, like, rudolph, valentino, marlene, dietrich, ronald, colman, and, charles, boyer, they, joined, a, homegrown, supply, of, actors, lured, west, from, the, new, york, city, stage, after, the, introduction, of, sound, films, to, form, one, of, the, 20th, century, s, most, remarkable, growth, industries, at, motion, pictures, height, of, popularity, in, the, mid, 1940s, the, studios, were, cranking, out, a, total, of, about, 400, movies, a, year, seen, by, an, audience, of, 90, million, americans, per, week, sound, also, became, widely, used, in, hollywood, in, the, late, 1920s, after, the, jazz, singer, the, first, film, with, synchronized, voices, was, successfully, released, as, a, vitaphone, talkie, in, 1927, hollywood, film, companies, would, respond, to, warner, bros, and, begin, to, use, vitaphone, sound, which, warner, bros, owned, until, 1928, in, future, films, by, may, 1928, electrical, research, product, incorporated, erpi, a, subsidiary, of, the, western, electric, company, gained, a, monopoly, over, film, sound, distribution, a, side, effect, of, the, talkies, was, that, many, actors, who, had, made, their, careers, in, silent, films, suddenly, found, themselves, out, of, work, as, they, often, had, bad, voices, or, could, not, remember, their, lines, meanwhile, in, 1922, us, politician, will, h, hays, left, politics, and, formed, the, movie, studio, boss, organization, known, as, the, motion, picture, producers, and, distributors, of, america, mppda, the, organization, became, the, motion, picture, association, of, america, after, hays, retired, in, 1945, in, the, early, times, of, talkies, american, studios, found, that, their, sound, productions, were, rejected, in, foreign, language, markets, and, even, among, speakers, of, other, dialects, of, english, the, synchronization, technology, was, still, too, primitive, for, dubbing, one, of, the, solutions, was, creating, parallel, foreign, language, versions, of, hollywood, films, around, 1930, the, american, companies, opened, a, studio, in, joinville, le, pont, france, where, the, same, sets, and, wardrobe, and, even, mass, scenes, were, used, for, different, time, sharing, crews, also, foreign, unemployed, actors, playwrights, and, winners, of, photogenic, contests, were, chosen, and, brought, to, hollywood, where, they, shot, parallel, versions, of, the, english, language, films, these, parallel, versions, had, a, lower, budget, were, shot, at, night, and, were, directed, by, second, line, american, directors, who, did, not, speak, the, foreign, language, the, spanish, language, crews, included, people, like, luis, bu, uel, enrique, jardiel, poncela, xavier, cugat, and, edgar, neville, the, productions, were, not, very, successful, in, their, intended, markets, due, to, the, following, reasons, classical, hollywood, cinema, or, the, golden, age, of, hollywood, is, defined, as, a, technical, and, narrative, style, characteristic, of, american, cinema, from, 1913, to, 1962, during, which, thousands, of, movies, were, issued, from, the, hollywood, studios, the, classical, style, began, to, emerge, in, 1913, was, accelerated, in, 1917, after, the, u, s, entered, world, war, i, and, finally, solidified, when, the, film, the, jazz, singer, was, released, in, 1927, ending, the, silent, film, era, and, increasing, box, office, profits, for, the, film, industry, by, introducing, sound, to, feature, films, most, hollywood, pictures, adhered, closely, to, a, formula, western, slapstick, comedy, musical, animated, cartoon, biographical, and, the, same, creative, teams, often, worked, on, films, made, by, the, same, studio, for, example, cedric, gibbons, and, herbert, stothart, always, worked, on, mgm, films, alfred, newman, worked, at, 20th, century, fox, for, twenty, years, cecil, b, de, mille, s, films, were, almost, all, made, at, paramount, and, director, henry, king, s, films, were, mostly, made, for, 20th, century, fox, at, the, same, time, one, could, usually, guess, which, studio, made, which, film, largely, because, of, the, actors, who, appeared, in, it, mgm, for, example, claimed, it, had, contracted, more, stars, than, there, are, in, heaven, each, studio, had, its, own, style, and, characteristic, touches, which, made, it, possible, to, know, this, a, trait, that, rarely, exists, today, for, example, to, have, and, have, not, 1944, is, notable, not, only, for, the, first, pairing, of, actors, humphrey, bogart, 1899, 1957, and, lauren, bacall, 1924, 2014, but, because, it, was, written, by, two, future, winners, of, the, nobel, prize, in, literature, ernest, hemingway, 1899, 1961, the, author, of, the, novel, on, which, the, script, was, nominally, based, and, william, faulkner, 1897, 1962, who, worked, on, the, screen, adaptation, after, the, jazz, singer, was, released, in, 1927, warner, bros, gained, huge, success, and, were, able, to, acquire, their, own, string, of, movie, theaters, after, purchasing, stanley, theaters, and, first, national, productions, in, 1928, in, contrast, loews, theaters, owned, mgm, since, forming, in, 1924, while, the, fox, film, corporation, owned, the, fox, theatre, rko, a, 1928, merger, between, keith, orpheum, theaters, and, the, radio, corporation, of, america, also, responded, to, the, western, electric, erpi, monopoly, over, sound, in, films, and, developed, their, own, method, known, as, photophone, to, put, sound, in, films, paramount, which, acquired, balaban, and, katz, in, 1926, would, answer, to, the, success, of, warner, bros, and, rko, and, buy, a, number, of, theaters, in, the, late, 1920s, as, well, and, would, hold, a, monopoly, on, theaters, in, detroit, michigan, by, the, 1930s, almost, all, of, the, first, run, metropolitan, theaters, in, the, united, states, were, owned, by, the, big, five, studios, mgm, paramount, pictures, rko, warner, bros, and, 20th, century, fox, motion, picture, companies, operated, under, the, studio, system, the, major, studios, kept, thousands, of, people, on, salary, actors, producers, directors, writers, stunt, men, crafts, persons, and, technicians, they, owned, or, leased, movie, ranches, in, rural, southern, california, for, location, shooting, of, westerns, and, other, large, scale, genre, films, and, the, major, studios, owned, hundreds, of, theaters, in, cities, and, towns, across, the, nation, in, 1920, film, theaters, that, showed, their, films, and, that, were, always, in, need, of, fresh, material, in, 1930, mppda, president, will, hays, created, the, hays, production, code, which, followed, censorship, guidelines, and, went, into, effect, after, government, threats, of, censorship, expanded, by, 1930, however, the, code, was, never, enforced, until, 1934, after, the, catholic, watchdog, organization, the, legion, of, decency, appalled, by, some, of, the, provocative, films, and, lurid, advertising, of, the, era, later, classified, pre, code, hollywood, threatened, a, boycott, of, motion, pictures, if, it, did, not, go, into, effect, the, films, that, did, not, obtain, a, seal, of, approval, from, the, production, code, administration, had, to, pay, a, 25, 000, fine, equivalent, to, 455, 976, in, 2023, and, could, not, profit, in, the, theaters, as, the, mppda, controlled, every, theater, in, the, country, through, the, big, five, studios, throughout, the, 1930s, as, well, as, most, of, the, golden, age, mgm, dominated, the, film, screen, and, had, the, top, stars, in, hollywood, and, they, were, also, credited, for, creating, the, hollywood, star, system, altogether, some, mgm, stars, included, king, of, hollywood, clark, gable, lionel, barrymore, jean, harlow, norma, shearer, greta, garbo, joan, crawford, jeanette, macdonald, gene, raymond, spencer, tracy, judy, garland, and, gene, kelly, but, mgm, did, not, stand, alone, another, great, achievement, of, american, cinema, during, this, era, came, through, walt, disney, s, animation, company, in, 1937, disney, created, the, most, successful, film, of, its, time, snow, white, and, the, seven, dwarfs, this, distinction, was, promptly, topped, in, 1939, when, selznick, international, created, what, is, still, when, adjusted, for, inflation, the, most, successful, film, of, all, time, in, gone, with, the, wind, many, film, historians, have, remarked, upon, the, many, great, works, of, cinema, that, emerged, from, this, period, of, highly, regimented, filmmaking, one, reason, this, was, possible, is, that, with, so, many, movies, being, made, not, every, one, had, to, be, a, big, hit, a, studio, could, gamble, on, a, medium, budget, feature, with, a, good, script, and, relatively, unknown, actors, citizen, kane, directed, by, orson, welles, 1915, 1985, and, often, regarded, as, the, greatest, film, of, all, time, fits, this, description, in, other, cases, strong, willed, directors, like, howard, hawks, 1896, 1977, alfred, hitchcock, 1899, 1980, and, frank, capra, 1897, 1991, battled, the, studios, in, order, to, achieve, their, artistic, visions, the, apogee, of, the, studio, system, may, have, been, the, year, 1939, which, saw, the, release, of, such, classics, as, the, wizard, of, oz, gone, with, the, wind, stagecoach, mr, smith, goes, to, washington, wuthering, heights, only, angels, have, wings, ninotchka, and, midnight, among, the, other, films, from, the, golden, age, period, that, are, now, considered, to, be, classics, casablanca, it, s, a, wonderful, life, it, happened, one, night, the, original, king, kong, mutiny, on, the, bounty, top, hat, city, lights, red, river, the, lady, from, shanghai, rear, window, on, the, waterfront, rebel, without, a, cause, some, like, it, hot, and, the, manchurian, candidate, the, studio, system, and, the, golden, age, of, hollywood, succumbed, to, two, forces, that, developed, in, the, late, 1940s, in, 1938, walt, disney, s, snow, white, and, the, seven, dwarfs, was, released, during, a, run, of, lackluster, films, from, the, major, studios, and, quickly, became, the, highest, grossing, film, released, to, that, point, embarrassingly, for, the, studios, it, was, an, independently, produced, animated, film, that, did, not, feature, any, studio, employed, stars, this, stoked, already, widespread, frustration, at, the, practice, of, block, booking, in, which, studios, would, only, sell, an, entire, year, s, schedule, of, films, at, a, time, to, theaters, and, use, the, lock, in, to, cover, for, releases, of, mediocre, quality, assistant, attorney, general, thurman, arnold, a, noted, trust, buster, of, the, roosevelt, administration, took, this, opportunity, to, initiate, proceedings, against, the, eight, largest, hollywood, studios, in, july, 1938, for, violations, of, the, sherman, antitrust, act, the, federal, suit, resulted, in, five, of, the, eight, studios, the, big, five, warner, bros, mgm, fox, rko, and, paramount, reaching, a, compromise, with, arnold, in, october, 1940, and, signing, a, consent, decree, agreeing, to, within, three, years, the, little, three, universal, studios, united, artists, and, columbia, pictures, who, did, not, own, any, theaters, refused, to, participate, in, the, consent, decree, a, number, of, independent, film, producers, were, also, unhappy, with, the, compromise, and, formed, a, union, known, as, the, society, of, independent, motion, picture, producers, and, sued, paramount, for, the, monopoly, they, still, had, over, the, detroit, theaters, as, paramount, was, also, gaining, dominance, through, actors, like, bob, hope, paulette, goddard, veronica,

to, rising, costs, in, the, film, industry, especially, the, rising, salaries, of, movie, stars, driven, by, powerful, agents, the, biggest, stars, like, sylvester, stallone, russell, crowe, tom,

single, largest, factor, driving, rising, costs, was, special, effects, by, 1999, the, average, cost, of, a, blockbuster, film, was, 60, million, before, marketing, and, promotion, which, cost, another, 80, million, since, the, beginning, of, 21st, century, the, theatrical, marketplace, has, slowly, been, dominated, by, the, superhero, genre, as, of, 2022, they, are, the, best, paying,

have, noted, the, increasing, treatment, of, films, as, content, by, corporations, that, correlate, with, the, increased, popularity, of, streaming, platforms, this, involves, the, blurring, of, boundaries, between, films, television, and, other, forms, of, media, as, more, people, consume, them, together, in, a, variety, of, ways, with, individual, films, defined, more, by, their, brand, identity, and, commercial, potential, rather, than, their, medium, stories, and, artistry, critic, matt, zoller, seitz, has, described, the, release, of, avengers, endgame, in, 2019, as, represent, the, decisive, defeat, of, cinema, by, content, due, to, its, grand, success, as, a, piece, of, entertainment, defined, by, the, marvel, brand, that, culminates, a, series, of, blockbuster, films, that, has, traits, of, serial, television, the, films, space, jam, a, new, legacy, and, red, notice, have, been, cited, as, examples, of, this, treatment, with, the, former, being, described, by, many, critics, as, a, lengthy, infomercial, for, hbo, max, featuring, scenes, and, characters, recalling, various, warner, bros, properties, such, as, casablanca, the, matrix, and, austin, powers, while, the, latter, is, a, 200, million, heist, film, from, netflix, that, critics, described, a, movie, that, feels, more, processed, by, a, machine, instead, of, anything, approaching, artistic, intent, or, even, an, honest, desire, to, entertain, some, have, expressed, that, space, jam, demonstrates, the, industry, s, increasingly, cynical, treatment, of, films, as, mere, intellectual, property, ip, to, be, exploited, an, approach, which, critic, scott, mendelson, called, ip, for, the, sake, of, ip, martin, scorsese, has, warned, that, cinema, as, an, art, form, is, being, systematically, devalued, sidelined, demeaned, and, reduced, to, content, and, called, blockbusters, overemphasis, on, box, office, returns, repulsive, quentin, tarantino, opined, that, the, 2020s,

blockbusters, stating, that, t, this, point, the, only, thing, that, makes, money, is, garbage, and, encouraged, industry, professionals, to, make, movies, outside, of, the, studio, system, as, much, as, possible, james, gray, noted, in, an, interview, with, deadline, when, you, make, movies, that, only, make, a, ton, of, money, and, only, one, kind, of, movie, you, begin, to, get, a, large, segment, of, the, population, out, of, the, habit, of, going, to, the, movies, which, causes, viewership, to, decrease, though, clarified, that, he, has, no, problem, with, a, comic, book, movie, as, a, solution, to, the, lack, of, investment, in, the, broad, based, engagement, with, the, product, he, suggests, that, studios, be, willing, to, lose, money, for, a, couple, of, years, on, art, film,

politics, and, hollywood, helped, in, that, media, with, actors, making, speeches, on, their, political, beliefs, like, jane, fonda, against, the, vietnam, war, despite, most, celebrities, and, producers, being, left, leaning, and, tending, to, support, the, democratic, party, this, era, produced, some, republican, actors, and, producers, such, as, clint, eastwood, and, jerry, bruckheimer,

on, four, capitalist, strategies, to, attract, and, integrate, non, us, film, producers, exhibitors, and, audiences, into, its, ambit, ownership, cross, border, productions, with, subordinate, service, providers, content, licensing, deals, with, exhibitors, and, blockbusters, designed, to, travel, the, globe, in, 1912, american, film, companies, were, largely, immersed, in, the, competition, for, the, domestic, market, it, was, difficult, to, satisfy, the, huge, demand, for, films, created, by, the, nickelodeon, boom, motion, picture, patents, company, members, such, as, edison, studios, also, sought, to, limit, competition, from, french, italian, and, other, imported, films, exporting, films, then, became, lucrative, to, these, companies, vitagraph, studios, was, the, first, american, company, to, open, its, own, distribution, offices, in, europe, establishing, a, branch, in, london, in, 1906, and, a, second, branch, in, paris, shortly, after, other, american, companies, were, moving, into, foreign, markets, as, well, and, american, distribution, abroad, continued, to, expand, until, the, mid, 1920s, originally, a, majority, of, companies, sold, their, films, indirectly, however, since, they, were, inexperienced, in, overseas, trading, they, simply, sold, the, foreign, rights, to, their, films, to, foreign, distribution, firms, or, export, agents, gradually, london, became, a, center, for, the, international, circulation, of, us, films, many, british, companies, made, a, profit, by, acting, as, the, agents, for, this, business, and, by, doing, so, they, weakened, british, production, by, turning, over, a, large, share, of, the, uk, market, to, american, films, by, 1911, approximately, 60, to, 70, percent, of, films, imported, into, great,

states, government, has, been, actively, promoting, free, trade, agendas, and, trade, on, cultural, products, hollywood, has, become, a, worldwide, cultural, source, the, success, on, hollywood, export, markets, can, be, known, not, only, from, the, boom, of, american, multinational, media, corporations, across, the, globe, but, also, from, the, unique, ability, to, make, big, budget, films, that, appeal, powerfully, to, popular, tastes, in, many, different, cultures, with, globalization, movie, production, has, been, clustered, in, hollywood, for, several, reasons, the, united, states, has, the, largest, single, home, market, in, dollar, terms, entertaining, and, highly, visible, hollywood, movies, have, global, appeal, and, the, role, of, english, as, a, universal, language, contributes, to, compensating, for, higher, fixed, costs, of, production, hollywood, has, moved, more, deeply, into, chinese, markets, although, influenced, by, china, s, censorship, films, made, in, china, are, censored, strictly, avoiding, themes, like, ghosts, violence, murder, horror, and, demons, such, plot, elements, risk, being, cut, hollywood, has, had, to, make, approved, films, corresponding, to, official, chinese, standards, but, with, aesthetic, standards, sacrificed, to, box, office, profits, even, chinese, audiences, found, it, boring, to, wait, for, the, release, of, great, american, movies, dubbed, in, their, native, language, women, are, statistically, underrepresented, in, creative, positions, in, the, center, of, the, us, film, industry, hollywood, this, underrepresentation, has, been, called, the, celluloid, ceiling, a, variant, on, the, employment, discrimination, term, glass, ceiling, in, 2013, the, top, paid, actors, made, 2, 1, 2, times, as,

article, stated, that, only, 15, of, the, top, films, in, 2013, had, women, for, a, lead, acting, role, the, author, of, the, study, noted, that, the, percentage, of, female, speaking, roles, has, not, increased, much, since, the, 1940s, when, they, hovered, around, 25, percent, to, 28, percent, since, 1998, women, s, representation, in, behind, the, scenes, roles, other, than, directing, has,

successful, in, its, efforts, to, reform, the, hfpa, would, be, disbanded, two, years, later, as, a, result, of, this, and, other, scandals, american, cinema, has, often, reflected, and, propagated, negative, stereotypes, towards, foreign, nationals, and, ethnic, minorities, for, example, russians, and, russian, americans, are, usually, portrayed, as, brutal, mobsters, ruthless, agents, and, villains, according, to, russian, american, professor, nina, l, khrushcheva, you, can, t, even, turn, the, tv, on, and, go, to, the, movies, without, reference, to, russians, as, horrible, italians, and, italian, americans, are, usually, associated, with, organized, crime, and, the, american, mafia, hispanic, and, latino, americans, are, largely, depicted, as, sexualized, figures, such, as, the,
