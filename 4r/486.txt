in, archaeology, rock, arts, are, human, made, markings, placed, on, natural, surfaces, typically, vertical, stone, surfaces, a, high, proportion, of, surviving, historic, and, prehistoric, rock, art, is, found, in, caves, or, partly, enclosed, rock, shelters, this, type, also, may, be, called, cave, art, or, parietal, art, a, global, phenomenon, rock, art, is, found, in, many, culturally, diverse, regions, of, the, world, it, has, been, produced, in, many, contexts, throughout, human, history, in, terms, of, technique, the, four, main, groups, are, the, oldest, known, rock, art, dates, from, the, upper, palaeolithic, period, having, been, found, in, europe, australia, asia, and, africa, anthropologists, studying, these, artworks, believe, that, they, likely, had, magico, religious, significance, the, archaeological, sub, discipline, of, rock, art, studies, first, developed, in, the, late, 19th, century, among, francophone, scholars, studying, the, rock, art, of, the, upper, palaeolithic, found, in, the, cave, systems, of, parts, of, western, europe, rock, art, continues, to, be, of, importance, to, indigenous, peoples, in, various, parts, of, the, world, who, view, them, as, both, sacred, items, and, significant, components, of, their, cultural, heritage, such, archaeological, sites, may, become, significant, sources, of, cultural, tourism, and, have, been, used, in, popular, culture, for, their, aesthetic, qualities, the, term, rock, art, appears, in, the, published, literature, as, early, as, the, 1940s, it, has, also, been, described, as, rock, carvings, rock, drawings, rock, engravings, rock, inscriptions, rock, paintings, rock, pictures, rock, records, and, rock, sculptures, parietal, art, is, a, term, for, art, in, caves, this, definition, usually, extended, to, art, in, rock, shelters, under, cliff, overhangs, popularly, it, is, called, cave, art, and, is, a, subset, of, the, wider, term, rock, art, it, is, mostly, on, rock, walls, but, may, be, on, ceilings, and, floors, a, wide, variety, of, techniques, have, been, used, in, its, creation, the, term, usually, is, applied, only, to, prehistoric, art, but, it, may, be, used, for, art, of, any, date, sheltered, parietal, art, has, had, a, far, better, chance, of, surviving, for, very, long, periods, and, what, now, survives, may, represent, only, a, very, small, proportion, of, what, was, created, both, parietal, and, cave, art, refer, to, cave, paintings, drawings, etchings, carvings, and, pecked, artwork, on, the, interior, of, caves, and, rock, shelters, generally, these, either, are, engraved, essentially, meaning, scratched, or, painted, or, they, are, created, using, a, combination, of, the, two, techniques, parietal, art, is, found, very, widely, throughout, the, world, and, in, many, places, new, examples, are, being, discovered, the, defining, characteristic, of, rock, art, is, that, it, is, placed, on, natural, rock, surfaces, in, this, way, it, is, distinct, from, artworks, placed, on, constructed, walls, or, free, standing, sculpture, as, such, rock, art, is, a, form, of, landscape, art, and, includes, designs, that, have, been, placed, on, boulder, and, cliff, faces, cave, walls, and, ceilings, and, on, the, ground, surface, rock, art, is, a, global, phenomenon, being, found, in, many, different, regions, of, the, world, there, are, various, forms, of, rock, art, some, archaeologists, also, consider, pits, and, grooves, in, the, rock, known, as, cupules, or, cups, or, rings, as, a, form, of, rock, art, although, there, are, exceptions, the, majority, of, rock, art, whose, creation, was, recorded, by, ethnographers, had, been, produced, during, rituals, as, such, the, study, of, rock, art, is, a, component, of, the, archaeology, of, religion, rock, art, serves, multiple, purposes, in, the, contemporary, world, in, several, regions, it, remains, spiritually, important, to, indigenous, peoples, who, view, it, as, a, significant, component, of, their, cultural, heritage, it, also, serves, as, an, important, source, of, cultural, tourism, and, hence, as, economic, revenue, in, certain, parts, of, the, world, as, such, images, taken, from, cave, art, have, appeared, on, memorabilia, and, other, artifacts, sold, as, a, part, of, the, tourist, industry, in, most, climates, only, paintings, in, sheltered, sites, in, particular, caves, have, survived, for, any, length, of, time, therefore, these, are, usually, called, cave, paintings, although, many, do, survive, in, rock, shelters, or, cliff, faces, under, an, overhang, in, prehistoric, times, these, were, often, popular, places, for, various, human, purposes, providing, some, shelter, from, the, weather, as, well, as, light, there, may, have, been, many, more, paintings, in, more, exposed, sites, that, are, now, lost, pictographs, are, paintings, or, drawings, that, have, been, placed, onto, the, rock, face, such, artworks, have, typically, been, made, with, mineral, earths, and, other, natural, compounds, found, across, much, of, the, world, the, predominantly, used, colours, are, red, black, and, white, red, paint, is, usually, attained, through, the, use, of, ground, ochre, while, black, paint, is, typically, composed, of, charcoal, or, sometimes, from, minerals, such, as, manganese, white, paint, is, usually, created, from, natural, chalk, kaolinite, clay, or, diatomaceous, earth, once, the, pigments, had, been, obtained, they, would, be, ground, and, mixed, with, a, liquid, such, as, water, blood, urine, or, egg, yolk, and, then, applied, to, the, stone, as, paint, using, a, brush, fingers, or, a, stamp, alternately, the, pigment, could, have, been, applied, on, dry, such, as, with, a, stick, of, charcoal, in, some, societies, the, paint, itself, has, symbolic, and, religious, meaning, for, instance, among, hunter, gatherer, groups, in, california, paint, was, only, allowed, to, be, traded, by, the, group, shamans, while, in, other, parts, of, north, america, the, word, for, paint, was, the, same, as, the, word, for, supernatural, spirit, one, common, form, of, pictograph, found, in, many, although, not, all, rock, art, producing, cultures, is, the, hand, print, there, are, three, forms, of, this, the, first, involves, covering, the, hand, in, wet, paint, and, then, applying, it, to, the, rock, the, second, involves, a, design, being, painted, onto, the, hand, which, is, then, in, turn, added, to, the, surface, the, third, involves, the, hand, first, being, placed, against, the, panel, with, dry, paint, then, being, blown, onto, it, through, a, tube, in, a, process, that, is, akin, to, air, brush, or, spray, painting, the, resulting, image, is, a, negative, print, of, the, hand, and, is, sometimes, described, as, a, stencil, in, australian, archaeology, miniature, stencilled, art, has, been, found, at, two, locations, in, australia, and, one, in, indonesia, petroglyphs, are, engravings, or, carvings, into, rock, which, is, left, in, situ, they, can, be, created, with, a, range, of, scratching, engraving, or, carving, techniques, often, with, the, use, of, a, hard, hammerstone, which, is, battered, against, the, stone, surface, in, certain, societies, the, choice, of, hammerstone, itself, has, religious, significance, in, other, instances, the, rock, art, is, pecked, out, through, indirect, percussion, as, a, second, rock, is, used, like, a, chisel, between, the, hammerstone, and, the, panel, a, third, rarer, form, of, engraving, rock, art, was, through, incision, or, scratching, into, the, surface, of, the, stone, with, a, lithic, flake, or, metal, blade, the, motifs, produced, using, this, technique, are, fine, lined, and, often, difficult, to, see, normally, found, in, literate, cultures, a, rock, relief, or, rock, cut, relief, is, a, relief, sculpture, carved, on, solid, or, living, rock, such, as, a, cliff, rather, than, a, detached, piece, of, stone, they, are, a, category, of, rock, art, and, sometimes, found, in, conjunction, with, rock, cut, architecture, however, they, tend, to, be, omitted, in, most, works, on, rock, art, which, concentrate, on, engravings, and, paintings, by, prehistoric, peoples, a, few, such, works, exploit, the, natural, contours, of, the, rock, and, use, them, to, define, an, image, but, they, do, not, amount, to, man, made, reliefs, rock, reliefs, have, been, made, in, many, cultures, and, were, especially, important, in, the, art, of, the, ancient, near, east, rock, reliefs, are, generally, fairly, large, as, they, need, to, be, to, make, an, impact, in, the, open, air, most, have, figures, that, are, over, life, size, and, in, many, the, figures, are, multiples, of, life, size, stylistically, they, normally, relate, to, other, types, of, sculpture, from, the, culture, and, period, concerned, and, except, for, hittite, and, persian, examples, they, are, generally, discussed, as, part, of, that, wider, subject, the, vertical, relief, is, most, common, but, reliefs, on, essentially, horizontal, surfaces, are, also, found, the, term, typically, excludes, relief, carvings, inside, caves, whether, natural, or, themselves, man, made, which, are, especially, found, in, india, natural, rock, formations, made, into, statues, or, other, sculpture, in, the, round, most, famously, at, the, great, sphinx, of, giza, are, also, usually, excluded, reliefs, on, large, boulders, left, in, their, natural, location, like, the, hittite, mamkullu, relief, are, likely, to, be, included, but, smaller, boulders, may, be, called, stelae, or, carved, orthostats, earth, figures, are, large, designs, and, motifs, that, are, created, on, the, stone, ground, surface, they, can, be, classified, through, their, method, of, manufacture, intaglios, are, created, by, scraping, away, the, desert, pavements, pebbles, covering, the, ground, to, reveal, a, negative, image, on, the, bedrock, below, the, best, known, example, of, such, intaglio, rock, art, is, the, nazca, lines, of, peru, in, contrast, geoglyphs, are, positive, images, which, are, created, by, piling, up, rocks, on, the, ground, surface, to, resulting, in, a, visible, motif, or, design, traditionally, individual, markings, are, called, motifs, and, groups, of, motifs, are, known, as, panels, sequences, of, panels, are, treated, as, archaeological, sites, this, method, of, classifying, rock, art, however, has, become, less, popular, as, the, structure, imposed, is, unlikely, to, have, had, any, relevance, to, the, art, s, creators, even, the, word, art, carries, with, it, many, modern, prejudices, about, the, purpose, of, the, features, rock, art, can, be, found, across, a, wide, geographical, and, temporal, spread, of, cultures, perhaps, to, mark, territory, to, record, historical, events, or, stories, or, to, help, enact, rituals, some, art, seems, to, depict, real, events, whilst, many, other, examples, are, apparently, entirely, abstract, prehistoric, rock, depictions, were, not, purely, descriptive, each, motif, and, design, had, a, deep, significance, that, is, not, always, understandable, to, modern, scholars, in, many, instances, the, creation, of, rock, art, was, itself, a, ritual, act, in, the, upper, palaeolithic, of, europe, rock, art, was, produced, inside, cave, systems, by, the, hunter, gatherer, peoples, who, inhabited, the, continent, the, oldest, known, example, is, the, chauvet, cave, in, france, although, others, have, been, located, including, lascaux, in, france, alta, mira, in, spain, and, creswell, crags, in, britain, and, grotta, del, genovese, in, sicily, the, late, prehistoric, rock, art, of, europe, has, been, divided, into, three, regions, by, archaeologists, in, atlantic, europe, the, coastal, seaboard, on, the, west, of, the, continent, which, stretches, from, iberia, up, through, france, and, encompasses, the, british, isles, a, variety, of, different, rock, arts, were, produced, from, the, neolithic, through, to, the, late, bronze, age, a, second, area, of, the, continent, to, contain, a, significant, rock, art, tradition, was, that, of, alpine, europe, with, the, majority, of, artworks, being, clustered, in, the, southern, slopes, of, the, mountainous, region, in, what, is, now, south, eastern, france, and, northern, italy, cave, paintings, are, found, in, most, parts, of, southern, africa, that, have, rock, overhangs, with, smooth, surfaces, among, these, sites, are, the, cave, sandstone, of, natal, orange, free, state, and, north, eastern, cape, the, granite, and, waterberg, sandstone, of, the, northern, transvaal, and, the, table, mountain, sandstone, of, the, southern, and, western, cape, the, oldest, reliably, dated, rock, art, in, the, americas, is, known, as, the, horny, little, man, it, is, petroglyph, depicting, a, stick, figure, with, an, oversized, phallus, and, carved, in, lapa, do, santo, a, cave, in, central, eastern, brazil, the, most, important, site, is, serra, da, capivara, national, park, at, piau, state, it, is, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, with, the, largest, collection, in, the, american, continent, and, one, of, the, most, studied, a, site, including, eight, miles, of, paintings, or, pictographs, that, is, under, study, in, colombia, south, america, at, serran, a, de, la, lindosa, was, revealed, in, november, 2020, their, age, is, suggested, as, being, 12, 500, years, old, c, 10, 480, b, c, by, the, anthropologists, working, on, the, site, because, of, extinct, fauna, depicted, rock, paintings, or, pictographs, are, located, in, many, areas, across, canada, there, are, over, 400, sites, attributed, to, the, ojibway, from, northern, saskatchewan, to, the, ottawa, river, however, cave, art, is, not, the, only, type, of, rock, art, while, cave, art, provides, the, two, dimensional, view, on, a, rocky, surface, figurines, made, of, a, rock, material, can, provide, a, three, dimensional, view, that, gives, insight, on, indigenous, views, towards, their, visual, arts, many, sites, along, and, off, the, california, coastline, such, as, the, channel, islands, and, malibu, have, both, realistic, and, abstract, styles, of, zoomorphic, effigy, figurines, from, archaeological, studies, at, these, sites, archaeologists, and, other, researchers, discovered, many, of, these, figurines, and, performed, a, composition, analysis, which, most, of, these, figurines, are, made, of, steatite, but, there, are, still, made, of, other, materials, as, a, result, from, these, archaeological, studies, these, figures, provided, context, about, spheres, of, interaction, between, tribal, groups, demonstrate, economical, significance, and, possibly, hold, a, ritual, function, as, well, under, one, study, by, archaeologists, richard, t, fitzgerald, and, christopher, corey, they, dated, the, earliest, figurines, to, be, around, the, middle, holocene, suggesting, two, socioeconomic, interactive, spheres, one, in, the, northern, and, one, in, the, southern, channel, islands, and, linguistic, similarities, between, takic, speaking, gabrileno, and, chumash, neighbors, these, figurines, share, similar, styles, between, these, tribes, providing, a, history, of, interactive, contact, little, lake, is, a, complex, of, rock, art, located, in, a, specific, point, in, time, and, space, in, rose, valley, inyo, county, rose, valley, is, located, in, the, boundaries, of, the, cultural, great, basin, and, the, territory, of, the, timbisha, shoshone, this, site, is, important, to, understanding, the, symbolism, and, value, of, north, american, rock, art, because, it, is, one, of, the, largest, collections, of, rock, art, unrelated, to, the, coso, an, indigenous, tribe, people, of, the, mojave, desert, its, importance, to, territorial, and, anthropological, studies, helps, many, understand, the, in, depth, descriptions, and, stylistic, analyses, of, large, rock, art, concentrations, which, are, valued, by, archaeologists, anthropologists, ethnographers, and, even, art, enthusiasts, referring, back, to, these, sites, help, social, scientists, understand, and, record, the, values, that, were, important, to, the, creators, it, shows, economic, values, or, settlement, patterns, that, were, once, a, daily, part, of, life, as, a, result, it, is, crucial, to, focus, on, the, variable, resources, to, understand, how, cultures, were, abiding, with, their, environment, however, the, rock, art, related, sites, at, little, rock, can, t, be, directly, dated, or, analyzed, australian, indigenous, art, represents, the, oldest, unbroken, tradition, of, art, in, the, world, there, are, more, than, 100, 000, recorded, rock, art, sites, in, australia, the, oldest, firmly, dated, rock, art, painting, in, australia, is, a, charcoal, drawing, on, a, rock, fragment, found, during, the, excavation, of, the, nawarla, gabarnmang, rock, shelter, in, south, western, arnhem, land, in, the, northern, territory, dated, at, 28, 000, years, it, is, one, of, the, oldest, known, pieces, of, rock, art, on, earth, with, a, confirmed, date, nawarla, gabarnmang, has, one, of, the, most, extensive, collections, of, rock, art, in, the, world, and, predates, both, lascaux, and, chauvet, cave, art, the, earliest, known, art, in, europe, by, at, least, 10, 000, years, in, 2008, rock, art, depicting, what, is, thought, to, be, a, thylacoleo, was, discovered, on, the, north, western, coast, of, the, kimberley, as, the, thylacoleo, is, believed, to, have, become, extinct, 45000, 46000, years, ago, roberts, et, al, 2001, gillespie, 2004, this, suggests, a, similar, age, for, the, associated, gwion, gwion, rock, paintings, archaeologist, kim, akerman, however, believes, that, the, megafauna, may, have, persisted, later, in, refugia, wetter, areas, of, the, continent, as, suggested, by, wells, 1985, 228, and, has, suggested, a, much, younger, age, for, the, paintings, pigments, from, the, gwion, gwion, of, the, kimberley, are, so, old, they, have, become, part, of, the, rock, itself, making, carbon, dating, impossible, some, experts, suggest, that, these, paintings, are, in, the, vicinity, of, 50, 000, years, old, and, may, even, pre, date, aboriginal, settlement, miniature, rock, art, of, the, stencilled, variety, at, a, rock, shelter, known, as, yilbilinji, in, the, limmen, national, park, in, the, northern, territory, is, one, of, only, three, known, examples, of, such, art, usually, stencilled, art, is, life, size, using, body, parts, as, the, stencil, but, the, 17, images, of, designs, of, human, figures, boomerangs, animals, such, as, crabs, and, long, necked, turtles, wavy, lines, and, geometric, shapes, are, very, rare, found, in, 2017, by, archaeologists, the, only, other, recorded, examples, are, at, nielson, s, creek, in, new, south, wales, and, at, kisar, island, in, indonesia, it, is, thought, that, the, designs, may, have, been, created, by, stencils, fashioned, out, of, beeswax, the, first, european, discovery, of, aboriginal, rock, paintings, took, place, on, 14, january, 1803, while, on, a, surveying, expedition, along, the, shores, and, islands, of, the, gulf, of, carpentaria, british, navigator, and, explorer, matthew, flinders, made, landfall, on, rugged, chasm, island, off, groote, eylandt, within, the, island, s, rock, shelters, flinders, discovered, an, array, of, painted, and, stenciled, patterns, to, record, these, images, he, enlisted, the, ship, s, artist, william, westall, westall, s, two, watercolour, sketches, are, the, earliest, known, documentation, of, australian, rock, art, in, his, journal, flinders, not, only, detailed, the, location, and, the, artworks, but, also, authored, the, inaugural, site, report, in, the, deep, sides, of, the, chasms, were, deep, holes, or, caverns, undermining, the, cliffs, upon, the, walls, of, which, i, found, rude, drawings, made, with, charcoal, and, something, like, red, paint, upon, the, white, ground, of, the, rock, these, drawings, represented, porpoises, turtle, kanguroos, and, a, human, hand, and, mr, westall, who, went, afterwards, to, see, them, found, the, representation, of, a, kanguroo, with, a, file, of, thirty, two, persons, following, after, it, the, third, person, of, the, band, was, twice, the, height, of, the, others, and, held, in, his, hand, something, resembling, the, whaddie, or, wooden, sword, of, the, natives, of, port, jackson, and, was, probably, intended, to, represent, a, chief, they, could, not, as, with, us, indicate, superiority, by, clothing, or, ornament, since, they, wore, none, of, any, kind, and, therefore, with, the, addition, of, a, weapon, similar, to, the, ancients, they, seem, to, have, made, superiority, of, person, the, principal, emblem, of, superior, power, of, which, indeed, power, is, usually, a, consequence, in, the, very, early, stages, of, society, in, new, zealand, north, otago, and, south, canterbury, have, a, rich, range, of, early, m, ori, rock, art, the, archaeological, sub, discipline, devoted, to, the, investigation, of, rock, art, is, known, as, rock, art, studies, rock, art, specialist, david, s, whitley, noted, that, research, in, this, area, required, an, integrated, effort, that, brings, together, archaeological, theory, method, fieldwork, analytical, techniques, and, interpretation, although, french, archaeologists, had, undertaken, much, research, into, rock, art, anglophone, archaeology, had, largely, neglected, the, subject, for, decades, the, discipline, of, rock, art, studies, witnessed, what, whitley, called, a, revolution, during, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, as, increasing, numbers, of, archaeologists, in, the, anglophone, world, and, latin, america, turned, their, attention, to, the, subject, in, doing, so, they, recognised, that, rock, art, could, be, used, to, understand, symbolic, and, religious, systems, gender, relations, cultural, boundaries, cultural, change, and, the, origins, of, art, and, belief, one, of, the, most, significant, figures, in, this, movement, was, the, south, african, archaeologist, david, lewis, williams, who, published, his, studies, of, san, rock, art, from, southern, africa, in, which, he, combined, ethnographic, data, to, reveal, the, original, purpose, of, the, artworks, lewis, williams, would, come, to, be, praised, for, elevating, rock, art, studies, to, a, theoretically, sophisticated, research, domain, by, whitley, however, the, study, of, rock, art, worldwide, is, marked, by, considerable, differences, of, opinion, with, respect, to, the, appropriateness, of, various, methods, and, the, most, relevant, and, defensible, theoretical, framework, the, unesco, world, rock, art, archive, working, group, met, in, 2011, to, discuss, the, base, model, for, a, world, rock, art, archive, while, no, official, output, has, been, generated, to, date, various, projects, around, the, world, such, as, the, global, rock, art, database, are, looking, at, making, rock, art, heritage, information, more, accessible, and, more, visible, to, assist, with, rock, art, awareness, conservation, and, preservation, issues
