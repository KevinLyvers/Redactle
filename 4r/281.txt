material, such, as, a, discussion, of, the, four, goals, of, life, or, puru, rtha, 12, 161, among, the, principal, works, and, stories, in, the, mah, bh, rata, are, the, bhagavad, gita, the, story,

abbreviated, version, of, the, r, m, ya, a, often, considered, as, works, in, their, own, right, traditionally, the, authorship, of, the, mah, bh, rata, is, attributed, to, vy, sa, there, have, been, many, attempts, to, unravel, its, historical, growth, and, compositional, layers, the, bulk, of, the, mah, bh, rata, was, probably, compiled, between, the, 3rd, century, bce, and, the, 3rd, century, ce, with, the, oldest, preserved, parts, not, much, older, than, around, 400, bce, the, text, probably, reached, its, final, form, by, the, early, gupta, period, c, 4th, century, ce, the, title, is, translated, as, great, bharat, india, or, the, story, of, the, great, descendents, of, bharata, or, as, the, great, indian, tale, the, mah, bh, rata, is, the, longest, epic, poem, known, and, has, been, described, as, the, longest, poem, ever, written, its, longest, version, consists, of, over, 100, 000, loka, or, over, 200, 000, individual, verse, lines, each, shloka, is, a, couplet, and, long, prose, passages, at, about, 1, 8, million, words, in, total, the, mah, bh, rata, is, roughly, ten, times, the, length, of, the, iliad, and, the, odyssey, combined, or, about, four, times, the, length, of, the, r, m, ya, a, within, the, indian, tradition, it, is, sometimes, called, the, fifth, veda, the, epic, is, traditionally, ascribed, to, the, sage, vyasa, who, is, also, a, major, figure, in, the, epic, vyasa, described, it, as, being, an, itihasa, transl, history, he, also, describes, the, guru, shishya, tradition, which, traces, all, great, teachers, and, their, students, of, the, vedic, times, the, first, section, of, the, mah, bh, rata, states, that, it, was, ganesha, who, wrote, down, the, text, to, vyasa, s, dictation, but, this, is, regarded, by, scholars, as, a, later, interpolation, to, the, epic, and, the, critical, edition, does, not, include, ganesha, the, epic, employs, the, story, within, a, story, structure, otherwise, known, as, frametales, popular, in, many, indian, religious, and, non, religious, works, it, is, first, recited, at, takshashila, by, the, sage, vaisampayana, a, disciple, of, vyasa, to, the, king, janamejaya, who, was, the, great, grandson, of, the, pandava, prince, arjuna, the, story, is, then, recited, again, by, a, professional, storyteller, named, ugrashrava, sauti, many, years, later, to, an, assemblage, of, sages, performing, the, 12, year, sacrifice, for, the, king, saunaka, kulapati, in, the, naimisha, forest, the, text, was, described, by, some, early, 20th, century, indologists, as, unstructured, and, chaotic, hermann, oldenberg, supposed, that, the, original, poem, must, once, have, carried, an, immense, tragic, force, but, dismissed, the, full, text, as, a, horrible, chaos, moritz, winternitz, geschichte, der, indischen, literatur, 1909, considered, that, only, unpoetical, theologists, and, clumsy, scribes, could, have, lumped, the, parts, of, disparate, origin, into, an, unordered, whole, research, on, the, mah, bh, rata, has, put, an, enormous, effort, into, recognizing, and, dating, layers, within, the, text, some, elements, of, the, present, mahabharata, can, be, traced, back, to, vedic, times, the, background, to, the, mah, bh, rata, suggests, the, origin, of, the, epic, occurs, after, the, very, early, vedic, period, and, before, the, first, indian, empire, was, to, rise, in, the, third, century, b, c, that, this, is, a, date, not, too, far, removed, from, the, 8th, or, 9th, century, b, c, is, likely, the, mahabharata, started, as, an, orally, transmitted, tale, of, the, charioteer, bards, it, is, generally, agreed, that, unlike, the, vedas, which, have, to, be, preserved, letter, perfect, the, epic, was, a, popular, work, whose, reciters, would, inevitably, conform, to, changes, in, language, and, style, so, the, earliest, surviving, components, of, this, dynamic, text, are, believed, to, be, no, older, than, the, earliest, external, references, we, have, to, the, epic, which, include, an, reference, in, panini, s, 4th, century, bce, grammar, ashtadhyayi, 4, 2, 56, vishnu, sukthankar, editor, of, the, first, great, critical, edition, of, the, mah, bh, rata, commented, it, is, useless, to, think, of, reconstructing, a, fluid, text, in, an, original, shape, based, on, an, archetype, and, a, stemma, codicum, what, then, is, possible, our, objective, can, only, be, to, reconstruct, the, oldest, form, of, the, text, which, it, is, possible, to, reach, based, on, the, manuscript, material, available, that, manuscript, evidence, is, somewhat, late, given, its, material, composition, and, the, climate, of, india, but, it, is, very, extensive, the, mah, bh, rata, itself, 1, 1, 61, distinguishes, a, core, portion, of, 24, 000, verses, the, bh, rata, proper, as, opposed, to, additional, secondary, material, while, the, ashvalayana, grihyasutra, 3, 4, 4, makes, a, similar, distinction, at, least, three, redactions, of, the, text, are, commonly, recognized, jaya, victory, with, 8, 800, verses, attributed, to, vyasa, the, bharata, with, 24, 000, verses, as, recited, by, vaisampayana, and, finally, the, mah, bh, rata, as, recited, by, ugrashrava, sauti, with, over, 100, 000, verses, however, some, scholars, such, as, john, brockington, argue, that, jaya, and, bharata, refer, to, the, same, text, and, ascribe, the, theory, of, jaya, with, 8, 800, verses, to, a, misreading, of, a, verse, in, the, adi, parva, 1, 1, 81, the, redaction, of, this, large, body, of, text, was, carried, out, after, formal, principles, emphasizing, the, numbers, 18, and, 12, the, addition, of, the, latest, parts, may, be, dated, by, the, absence, of, the, anushasana, parva, and, the, virata, parva, from, the, spitzer, manuscript, the, oldest, surviving, sanskrit, text, dates, to, the, kushan, period, 200, ce, according, to, what, one, figure, says, at, mbh, 1, 1, 50, there, were, three, versions, of, the, epic, beginning, with, manu, 1, 1, 27, astika, 1, 3, sub, parva, 5, or, vasu, 1, 57, respectively, these, versions, would, correspond, to, the, addition, of, one, and, then, another, frame, settings, of, dialogues, the, vasu, version, would, omit, the, frame, settings, and, begin, with, the, account, of, the, birth, of, vyasa, the, astika, version, would, add, the, sarpasattra, and, ashvamedha, material, from, brahmanical, literature, introduce, the, name, mah, bh, rata, and, identify, vyasa, as, the, work, s, author, the, redactors, of, these, additions, were, probably, pancharatrin, scholars, who, according, to, oberlies, 1998, likely, retained, control, over, the, text, until, its, final, redaction, mention, of, the, huna, in, the, bhishma, parva, however, appears, to, imply, that, this, parva, may, have, been, edited, around, the, 4th, century, the, adi, parva, includes, the, snake, sacrifice, sarpasattra, of, janamejaya, explaining, its, motivation, detailing, why, all, snakes, in, existence, were, intended, to, be, destroyed, and, why, despite, this, there, are, still, snakes, in, existence, this, sarpasattra, material, was, often, considered, an, independent, tale, added, to, a, version, of, the, mah, bh, rata, by, thematic, attraction, minkowski, 1991, and, considered, to, have, a, particularly, close, connection, to, vedic, brahmana, literature, the, panchavimsha, brahmana, at, 25, 15, 3, enumerates, the, officiant, priests, of, a, sarpasattra, among, whom, the, names, dhritarashtra, and, janamejaya, two, main, figures, of, the, mah, bh, rata, s, sarpasattra, as, well, as, takshaka, a, snake, in, the, mah, bh, rata, occur, the, suparnakhyana, a, late, vedic, period, poem, considered, to, be, among, the, earliest, traces, of, epic, poetry, in, india, is, an, older, shorter, precursor, to, the, expanded, legend, of, garuda, that, is, included, in, the, astika, parva, within, the, adi, parva, of, the, mah, bh, rata, the, earliest, known, references, to, bh, rata, and, the, compound, mah, bh, rata, date, to, the, ashtadhyayi, sutra, 6, 2, 38, of, panini, fl, 4th, century, bce, and, the, ashvalayana, grihyasutra, 3, 4, 4, this, may, mean, the, core, 24, 000, verses, known, as, the, bh, rata, as, well, as, an, early, version, of, the, extended, mah, bh, rata, were, composed, by, the, 4th, century, bce, however, it, is, not, certain, whether, panini, referred, to, the, epic, as, bh, rata, was, also, used, to, describe, other, things, albrecht, weber, mentions, the, rigvedic, tribe, of, the, bharatas, where, a, great, person, might, have, been, designated, as, mah, bh, rata, however, as, panini, also, mentions, figures, that, play, a, role, in, the, mah, bh, rata, some, parts, of, the, epic, may, have, already, been, known, in, his, day, another, aspect, is, that, pani, determined, the, accent, of, mah, bh, rata, however, the, mah, bh, rata, was, not, recited, in, vedic, accent, the, greek, writer, dio, chrysostom, c, 40, c, 120, ce, reported, that, homer, s, poetry, was, being, sung, even, in, india, many, scholars, have, taken, this, as, evidence, for, the, existence, of, a, m, habh, rata, at, this, date, whose, episodes, dio, or, his, sources, identify, with, the, story, of, the, iliad, several, stories, within, the, mah, bh, rata, took, on, separate, identities, of, their, own, in, classical, sanskrit, literature, for, instance, the, abhijnanashkuntala, by, the, renowned, sanskrit, poet, kalidasa, c, 400, ce, believed, to, have, lived, in, the, era, of, the, gupta, dynasty, is, based, on, a, story, that, is, the, precursor, to, the, mah, bh, rata, the, urubhanga, a, sanskrit, play, written, by, bhasa, who, is, believed, to, have, lived, before, kalidasa, is, based, on, the, slaying, of, duryodhana, by, the, splitting, of, his, thighs, by, bhima, the, copper, plate, inscription, of, the, maharaja, sharvanatha, 533, 534, ce, from, khoh, satna, district, madhya, pradesh, describes, the, mah, bh, rata, as, a, collection, of, 100, 000, verses, ata, sahasri, sa, hit, the, division, into, 18, parvas, is, as, follows, the, historicity, of, the, kurukshetra, war, is, unclear, many, historians, estimate, the, date, of, the, kurukshetra, war, to, iron, age, india, of, the, 10th, century, bce, the, setting, of, the, epic, has, a, historical, precedent, in, iron, age, vedic, india, where, the, kuru, kingdom, was, the, center, of, political, power, during, roughly, 1200, to, 800, bce, a, dynastic, conflict, of, the, period, could, have, been, the, inspiration, for, the, jaya, the, foundation, on, which, the, mah, bh, rata, corpus, was, built, with, a, climactic, battle, eventually, coming, to, be, viewed, as, an, epochal, event, puranic, literature, presents, genealogical, lists, associated, with, the, mah, bh, rata, narrative, the, evidence, of, the, puranas, is, of, two, kinds, of, the, first, kind, there, is, the, direct, statement, that, there, were, 1, 015, or, 1, 050, years, between, the, birth, of, parikshit, arjuna, s, grandson, and, the, accession, of, mahapadma, nanda, 400, 329, bce, which, would, yield, an, estimate, of, about, 1400, bce, for, the, bharata, battle, however, this, would, imply, improbably, long, reigns, on, average, for, the, kings, listed, in, the, genealogies, of, the, second, kind, is, analysis, of, parallel, genealogies, in, the, puranas, between, the, times, of, adhisimakrishna, parikshit, s, great, grandson, and, mahapadma, nanda, pargiter, accordingly, estimated, 26, generations, by, averaging, 10, different, dynastic, lists, and, assuming, 18, years, for, the, average, duration, of, a, reign, arrived, at, an, estimate, of, 850, bce, for, adhisimakrishna, and, thus, approximately, 950, bce, for, the, bharata, battle, b, b, lal, used, the, same, approach, with, a, more, conservative, assumption, of, the, average, reign, to, estimate, a, date, of, 836, bce, and, correlated, this, with, archaeological, evidence, from, painted, grey, ware, pgw, sites, the, association, being, strong, between, pgw, artifacts, and, places, mentioned, in, the, epic, john, keay, confirms, this, and, also, gives, 950, bce, for, the, bharata, battle, attempts, to, date, the, events, using, methods, of, archaeoastronomy, have, produced, depending, on, which, passages, are, chosen, and, how, they, are, interpreted, estimates, ranging, from, the, late, 4th, to, the, mid, 2nd, millennium, bce, the, late, 4th, millennium, date, has, a, precedent, in, the, calculation, of, the, kali, yuga, epoch, based, on, planetary, conjunctions, by, aryabhata, 6th, century, aryabhata, s, date, of, 18, february, 3102, bce, for, mah, bh, rata, war, has, become, widespread, in, indian, tradition, some, sources, mark, this, as, the, disappearance, of, krishna, from, the, earth, the, aihole, inscription, of, pulakeshin, ii, dated, to, saka, 556, 634, ce, claims, that, 3, 735, years, have, elapsed, since, the, bh, rata, battle, putting, the, date, of, mah, bh, rata, war, at, 3137bce, another, traditional, school, of, astronomers, and, historians, represented, by, vrddha, garga, var, hamihira, and, kalhana, place, the, bharata, war, 653, years, after, the, kali, yuga, epoch, corresponding, to, 2449, bce, according, to, var, hamihira, s, b, hat, sa, hit, 6th, century, yudhishthara, lived, 2, 526, years, before, the, beginning, of, the, shaka, era, which, begins, in, the, 78, ce, this, places, yudhishthara, and, therefore, the, mahabharata, war, around, 2448, 2449, bce, 2526, 78, some, scholars, have, attempted, to, identify, the, shaka, calendar, era, mentioned, by, var, hamihira, with, other, eras, but, such, identifications, place, var, hamihira, in, the, first, century, bce, which, is, impossible, as, he, refers, to, the, 5th, century, astronomer, aryabhata, kalhana, s, rajatarangini, 11th, century, apparently, relying, on, var, hamihira, also, states, that, the, pandavas, flourished, 653, years, after, the, beginning, of, the, kali, yuga, kalhana, adds, that, people, who, believe, that, the, bharata, war, was, fought, at, the, end, of, the, dvapara, yuga, are, foolish, the, core, story, of, the, work, is, that, of, a, dynastic, struggle, for, the, throne, of, hastinapura, the, kingdom, ruled, by, the, kuru, clan, the, two, collateral, branches, of, the, family, that, participate, in, the, struggle, are, the, kaurava, and, the, pandava, although, the, kaurava, is, the, senior, branch, of, the, family, duryodhana, the, eldest, kaurava, is, younger, than, yudhishthira, the, eldest, pandava, both, duryodhana, and, yudhishthira, claim, to, be, first, in, line, to, inherit, the, throne, the, struggle, culminates, in, the, kurukshetra, war, in, which, the, pandavas, are, ultimately, victorious, the, battle, produces, complex, conflicts, of, kinship, and, friendship, instances, of, family, loyalty, and, duty, taking, precedence, over, what, is, right, as, well, as, the, converse, the, mah, bh, rata, itself, ends, with, the, death, of, krishna, and, the, subsequent, end, of, his, dynasty, and, ascent, of, the, pandava, brothers, to, heaven, it, also, marks, the, beginning, of, the, hindu, age, of, kali, yuga, the, fourth, and, final, age, of, humankind, in, which, great, values, and, noble, ideas, have, crumbled, and, people, are, heading, towards, the, complete, dissolution, of, right, action, morality, and, virtue, king, janamejaya, s, ancestor, shantanu, the, king, of, hastinapura, has, a, short, lived, marriage, with, the, goddess, ganga, and, has, a, son, devavrata, later, to, be, called, bhishma, a, great, warrior, who, becomes, the, heir, apparent, many, years, later, when, king, shantanu, goes, hunting, he, sees, satyavati, the, daughter, of, the, chief, of, fishermen, and, asks, her, father, for, her, hand, her, father, refuses, to, consent, to, the, marriage, unless, shantanu, promises, to, make, any, future, son, of, satyavati, the, king, upon, his, death, to, resolve, his, father, s, dilemma, devavrata, agrees, to, relinquish, his, right, to, the, throne, as, the, fisherman, is, not, sure, about, the, prince, s, children, honoring, the, promise, devavrata, also, takes, a, vow, of, lifelong, celibacy, to, guarantee, his, father, s, promise, shantanu, has, two, sons, by, satyavati, chitr, ngada, and, vichitravirya, upon, shantanu, s, death, chitrangada, becomes, king, he, lives, a, very, short, uneventful, life, and, dies, vichitravirya, the, younger, son, rules, hastinapura, meanwhile, the, king, of, k, arranges, a, swayamvara, for, his, three,

ambika, and, ambalika, uninvited, and, proceeds, to, abduct, them, ambika, and, ambalika, consent, to, be, married, to, vichitravirya, the, oldest, princess, amba, however, informs, bhishma, that, she, wishes, to, marry, the, king, of, shalva, whom, bhishma, defeated, at, their, swayamvara, bhishma, lets, her, leave, to, marry, the, king, of, shalva, but, shalva, refuses, to, marry, her, still, smarting, at, his, humiliation, at, the, hands, of, bhishma, amba, then, returns, to, marry, bhishma, but, he, refuses, due, to, his, vow, of, celibacy, amba, becomes, enraged, and, becomes, bhishma,

previous, union, with, the, sage, parashara, to, father, children, with, the, widows, the, eldest, ambika, shuts, her, eyes, when, she, sees, him, and, so, her, son, dhritarashtra, is, born, blind, ambalika, turns, pale, and, bloodless, upon, seeing, him, and, thus, her, son, pandu, is, born, pale, and, unhealthy, the, term, pandu, may, also, mean, jaundiced, due, to, the, physical, challenges, of, the, first, two, children, satyavati, asks, vyasa, to, try, once, again, however, ambika, and, ambalika, send, their, maid, instead, to, vyasa, s, room, vyasa, fathers, a, third, son, vidura, by, the, maid, he, is, born, healthy, and, grows, up, to, be, one, of, the, wisest, figures, in, the, mahabharata, he, serves, as, prime, minister, mahamantri, or, mahatma, to, king, pandu, and, king, dhritarashtra, when, the, princes, grow, up, dhritarashtra, is, about, to, be, crowned, king, by, bhishma, when, vidura, intervenes, and, uses, his, knowledge, of, politics, to, assert, that, a, blind, person, cannot, be, king, this, is, because, a, blind, man, cannot, control, and, protect, his, subjects, the, throne, is, then, given, to, pandu, because, of, dhritarashtra, s, blindness, pandu, marries, twice, to, kunti, and, madri, dhritarashtra, marries, gandhari, a, princess, from, gandhara, who, blindfolds, herself, for, the, rest, of, her, life, so, that, she, may, feel, the,

of, a, moving, artificial, fish, while, looking, at, its, reflection, in, oil, below, in, popular, versions, after, all, the, princes, fail, many, being, unable, to, lift, the, bow, karna, proceeds, to, the, attempt, but, is, interrupted, by, draupadi, who, refuses, to, marry, a, suta, this, has, been, excised, from, the, critical, edition, of, mahabharata, as, later, interpolation, after, this, the, swayamvara, is, opened, to, the, brahmins, leading, arjuna, to, win, the, contest, and, marry, draupadi, the, pandavas, return, home, and, inform, their, meditating, mother, that, arjuna, has,

wealth, of, the, pandavas, duryodhana, decides, to, host, a, dice, game, on, shakuni, s, suggestion, this, suggestion, was, accepted, by, yudhisthira, despite, the, rest, of, the, pandavas, advising,

to, disrobe, draupadi, in, front, of, the, entire, court, but, draupadi, s, disrobe, is, prevented, by, krishna, who, miraculously, make, her, dress, endless, therefore, it, couldn, t, be, removed, dhritarashtra, bhishma, and, the, other, elders, are, aghast, at, the, situation, but, duryodhana, is, adamant, that, there, is, no, place, for, two, crown, princes, in, hastinapura, against, his, wishes, dhritarashtra, orders, for, another, dice, game, the, pandavas, are, required, to, go, into, exile, for, 12, years, and, in, the, 13th, year, they, must, remain, hidden, if, they, are, discovered, by, the, kauravas, in, the, 13th, year, of, their, exile, then, they, will, be, forced, into, exile, for, another, 12, years, the, pandavas, spend, thirteen, years, in, exile, many,

spend, their, final, year, in, disguise, in, the, court, of, the, king, virata, and, they, are, discovered, just, after, the, end, of, the, year, at, the, end, of, their, exile, they, try, to, negotiate, a, return, to, indraprastha, with, krishna, as, their, emissary, however, this, negotiation, fails, because, duryodhana, objected, that, they, were, discovered, in, the, 13th, year, of, their, exile, and, the, return, of, their, kingdom, was, not, agreed, upon, then, the, pandavas, fought, the, kauravas, claiming, their, rights, over, indraprastha, the, two, sides, summon, vast,

at, this, time, krishna, reminds, him, of, his, duty, as, a, kshatriya, to, fight, for, a, righteous, cause, in, the, famous, bhagavad, gita, section, of, the, epic, though, initially, sticking, to, chivalrous, notions, of, warfare, both, sides, soon, adopt, dishonorable, tactics, at, the, end, of, the, 18, day, battle, only, the, pandavas, satyaki, kripa, ashwatthama, kritavarma, yuyutsu, and,
