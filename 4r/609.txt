extremity, as, well, as, films, of, michael, haneke, and, lars, von, trier, generated, harsh, criticism, and, controversy, extensive, theatrical, screening, lack, of, diversity, protests, and, various, scandals, continued, over, the, years, to, be, one, of, the, most, polarizing, the, cannes, film, festival, has, its, origins, in, 1938, when, jean, zay, the, french, minister, of, national, education, on, the, proposal, of, high, ranking, official, and, historian, philippe, erlanger, and, film, journalist, robert, favre, le, bret, decided, to, set, up, an, international, cinematographic, festival, they, found, the, support, of, the, americans, and, the, british, its, creation, can, be, largely, attributed, to, the, french, desire, to, compete, with, the, venice, film, festival, which, at, the, time, was, the, only, international, film, festival, and, had, shown, a, lack, of, impartiality, with, its, fascist, bias, during, those, years, the, political, interference, seemed, evident, in, the, 1937, edition, when, benito, mussolini, meddled, to, ensure, that, french, pacifist, film, la, grande, illusion, would, not, win, the, last, straw, was, in, the, 1938, event, when, mussolini, and, adolf, hitler, respectively, overruled, the, jury, s, decision, in, order, to, award, the, coppa, mussolini, mussolini, cup, for, the, best, film, to, italian, war, film, luciano, serra, pilot, produced, under, the, supervision, of, mussolini, s, son, and, the, coppa, mussolini, for, the, best, foreign, film, to, olympia, a, german, documentary, film, about, the, berlin, 1936, summer, olympics, produced, in, association, with, the, nazi, ministry, of, public, enlightenment, and, propaganda, despite, the, fact, that, the, regulations, at, that, time, prohibited, awarding, a, documentary, outraged, by, the, decision, and, as, a, measure, of, protest, the, french, british, and, american, jury, members, decided, to, withdraw, from, the, festival, with, the, intention, of, not, returning, this, snub, encouraged, the, french, to, found, a, free, festival, thus, on, 31, may, 1939, the, city, of, cannes, was, finally, selected, as, the, location, for, the, festival, over, biarritz, and, the, town, hall, along, with, the, french, government, signed, the, international, film, festival, s, official, birth, certificate, with, the, name, of, le, festival, international, du, film, the, reason, for, deciding, cannes, was, because, of, its, touristic, appeal, as, a, french, riviera, resort, town, and, also, because, the, city, hall, offered, to, increase, the, municipality, s, financial, participation, including, the, commitment, of, building, a, dedicated, venue, for, the, event, hollywood, stars, of, the, moment, like, gary, cooper, cary, grant, tyrone, power, douglas,
