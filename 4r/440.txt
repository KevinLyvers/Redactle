developed, through, the, years, as, a, genre, of, its, own, in, which, art, is, presented, live, it, had, an, important, and, fundamental, role, in, 20th, century, avant, garde, art, it, involves,

museums, can, take, place, in, the, street, any, kind, of, setting, or, space, and, during, any, time, period, its, goal, is, to, generate, a, reaction, sometimes, with, the, support, of, improvisation, and, a, sense, of, aesthetics, the, themes, are, commonly, linked, to, life, experiences, of, the, artist, themselves, the, need, for, denunciation, or, social, criticism, and, with, a, spirit, of, transformation, the, term, performance, art, and, performance, became, widely, used, in, the, 1970s, even, though, the, history, of, performance, in, visual, arts, dates, back, to, futurist, productions, and, cabarets, from, the, 1910s, art, critic, and, performance, artist, john, perreault, credits, marjorie, strider, with, the, invention, of, the, term, in, 1969, the, main,

linked, to, the, happenings, and, events, of, the, fluxus, movement, viennese, actionism, body, art, and, conceptual, art, the, definition, and, historical, and, pedagogical, contextualization, of, performance, art, is, controversial, one, of, the, handicaps, comes, from, the, term, itself, which, is, polysemic, and, one, of, its, meanings, relates, to, the, scenic, arts, this, meaning, of, performance, in, the, scenic, arts, context, is, opposite, to, the, meaning, of, performance, art, since, performance, art, emerged, with, a, critical, and, antagonistic, position, towards, scenic, arts, performance, art, only, adjoins, the, scenic, arts, in, certain, aspects, such, as, the, audience, and, the, present, body, and, still, not, every, performance, art, piece, contains, these, elements, the, meaning, of, the, term, in, the, narrower, sense, is, related, to, postmodernist, traditions, in, western, culture, from, about, the, mid, 1960s, into, the, 1970s, often, derived, from, concepts, of, visual, art, with, respect, to, antonin, artaud, dada, the, situationists, fluxus, installation, art, and, conceptual, art, performance, art, tended, to, be, defined, as, an, antithesis, to, theatre, challenging, orthodox, art, forms, and, cultural, norms, the, ideal, had, been, an, ephemeral, and, authentic, experience, for, performer, and, audience, in, an, event, that, could, not, be, repeated, captured, or, purchased, the, widely, discussed, difference, how, concepts, of, visual, arts, and, concepts, of, performing, arts, are, used, can, determine, the, meanings, of, a, performance, art, presentation, performance, art, is, a, term, usually, reserved, to, refer, to, a, conceptual, art, which, conveys, a, content, based, meaning, in, a, more, drama, related, sense, rather, than, being, simple, performance, for, its, own, sake, for, entertainment, purposes, it, largely, refers, to, a, performance, presented, to, an, audience, but, which, does, not, seek, to, present, a, conventional, theatrical, play, or, a, formal, linear, narrative, or, which, alternately, does, not, seek, to, depict, a, set, of, fictitious, characters, in, formal, scripted, interactions, it, therefore, can, include, action, or, spoken, word, as, a, communication, between, the, artist, and, audience, or, even, ignore, expectations, of, an, audience, rather, than, following, a, script, written, beforehand, some, types, of, performance, art, nevertheless, can, be, close, to, performing, arts, such, performance, may, use, a, script, or, create, a, fictitious, dramatic, setting, but, still, constitute, performance, art, in, that, it, does, not, seek, to, follow, the, usual, dramatic, norm, of, creating, a, fictitious, setting, with, a, linear, script, which, follows, conventional, real, world, dynamics, rather, it, would, intentionally, seek, to, satirize, or, to, transcend, the, usual, real, world, dynamics, which, are, used, in, conventional, theatrical, plays, performance, artists, often, challenge, the, audience, to, think, in, new, and, unconventional, ways, break, conventions, of, traditional, arts, and, break, down, conventional, ideas, about, what, art, is, as, long, as, the, performer, does, not, become, a, player, who, repeats, a, role, performance, art, can, include, satirical, elements, use, robots, and, machines, as, performers, as, in, pieces, of, the, survival, research, laboratories, involve, ritualised, elements, e, g, shaun, caton, or, borrow, elements, of, any, performing, arts, such, as, dance, music, and, circus, it, can, also, involve, intersection, with, architecture, some, artists, e, g, the, viennese, actionists, and, neo, dadaists, prefer, to, use, the, terms, live, art, action, art, actions,

thought, and, clearly, against, anything, universal, it, promoted, change, spontaneity, immediacy, contradiction, randomness, and, the, defense, of, chaos, against, the, order, and, imperfection,

be, reimagined, in, the, works, of, contemporary, artists, such, as, clifford, owens, gillian, walsh, pat, oleszko, and, rebecca, patek, amongst, others, new, artists, with, radical, acts, consolidated, themselves, as, the, main, precursors, of, performance, like, chris, burden, with, the, 1971, work, shoot, where, an, assistant, shot, him, in, the, arm, from, a, five, meter, distance, and, vito, acconci, the, same, year, with, seedbed, the, work, eye, body, 1963, by, carolee, schneemann, en, 1963, had, already, been, considered, a, prototype, of, performance, art, in, 1975, schneemann, recurred, to, innovative, solo, acts, such, as, interior, scroll, that, showed, the, feminine, body, as, an, artistic, media, one, of, the, main, artists, was, gina, pane, french, artist, of, italian, origins, she, studied, at, the, cole, nationale, sup, rieure, des, beaux, arts, in, par, s, from, 1960, until, 1965, and, was, a, member, of, the, performance, art, movement, in, the, 1970, in, france, called, art, corporel, parallel, to, her, art, pane, taught, in, the, ecole, des, beaux, arts, in, mans, from, 1975, until, 1990, and, directed, an, atelier, dedicated, to, performance, art, in, the, pompidou, centre, from, 1978, to, 1979, one, of, her, best, known, works, is, the, conditioning, 1973, in, which, she, was, lied, into, a, metal, bed, spring, over, an, area, of, lit, candles, the, conditioning, was, created, as, an, homage, to, marina, abramovi, part, of, her, seven, easy, pieces, 2005, in, the, solomon, r, guggenheim, museum, in, new, york, city, in, 2005, great, part, of, her, works, are, protagonized, by, self, inflicted, pain, separating, her, from, most, of, other, woman, artists, in, the, 1970s, through, the, violence, of, cutting, her, skin, with, razors, or, extinguishing, fires, with, her, bare, hands, and, feet, pane, has, the, intention, of, inciting, a, real, experience, in, the, visitor, who, would, feel, moved, for, its, discomfort, the, impactful, nature, of, these, first, performance, art, pieces, or, actions, as, she, preferred, to, call, them, many, times, eclipsed, her, prolific, photographic, and, sculptural, work, nonetheless, the, body, was, the, main, concern, in, panes, s, work, either, literally, or, conceptually, until, the, 1980s, performance, art, has, demystified, virtuosism, this, being, one, of, its, key, characteristics, nonetheless, from, the, 1980s, on, it, started, to, adopt, some, technical, brilliancy, in, reference, to, the, work, presence, and, resistance, by, philip, auslander, the, dance, critic, sally, banes, writes, by, the, end, of, the, 1980s, performance, art, had, become, so, widely, known, that, it, no, longer, needed, to, be, defined, mass, culture, especially, television, had, come, to, supply, both, structure, and, subject, matter, for, much, performance, art, and, several, performance, artists, including, laurie, anderson, spalding, gray, eric, bogosian, willem, dafoe, and, ann, magnuson, had, indeed, become, crossover, artists, in, mainstream, entertainment, in, this, decade, the, parameters, and, technicalities, built, to, purify, and, perfect, performance, art, were, defined, despite, the, fact, that, many, performances, are, held, within, the, circle, of, a, small, art, world, group, roselee, goldberg, notes, in, performance, art, from, futurism, to, the, present, that, performance, has, been, a, way, of, appealing, directly, to, a, large, public, as, well, as, shocking, audiences, into, reassessing, their, own, notions, of, art, and, its, relation, to, culture, conversely, public, interest, in, the, medium, especially, in, the, 1980s, stems, from, an, apparent, desire, of, that, public, to, gain, access, to, the, art, world, to, be, a, spectator, of, its, ritual, and, its, distinct, community, and, to, be, surprised, by, the, unexpected, always, unorthodox, presentations, that, the, artists, devise, in, this, decade, publications, and, compilations, about, performance, art, and, its, best, known, artists, emerged, in, the, 1980s, the, political, context, played, an, important, role, in, the, artistic, development, and, especially, in, performance, as, almost, every, one, of, the, works, created, with, a, critical, and, political, discourse, were, in, this, discipline, until, the, decline, of, the, european, eastern, bloc, during, the, late, 1980s, performance, art, had, actively, been, rejected, by, most, communist, governments, with, the, exception, of, poland, and, yugoslavia, performance, art, was, more, or, less, banned, in, countries, where, any, independent, public, event, was, feared, in, the, gdr, czechoslovakia, hungary, and, latvia, it, happened, in, apartments, at, seemingly, spontaneous, gatherings, in, artist, studios, in, church, controlled, settings, or, was, covered, as, another, activity, like, a, photo, shoot, isolated, from, the, western, conceptual, context, in, different, settings, it, could, be, like, a, playful, protest, or, a, bitter, comment, using, subversive, metaphors, to, express, dissent, with, the, political, situation, amongst, the, most, remarkable, performance, art, works, of, political, content, in, this, time, were, those, of, tehching, hsieh, between, july, 1983, and, july, 1984, art, life, one, year, performance, rope, piece, in, 1982, the, terms, poetry, and, performance, were, first, used, together, performance, poetry, appeared, to, distinguish, text, based, vocal, performances, from, performance, art, especially, the, work, of, escenic, and, musical, performance, artists, such, as, laurie, anderson, who, worked, with, music, at, that, time, performance, poets, relied, more, on, the, rhetorical, and, philosophical, expression, in, their, poetics, than, performance, artists, who, arose, from, the, visual, art, genres, of, painting, and, sculpture, many, artists, since, john, cage, fuse, performance, with, a, poetical, base, since, 1973, the, feminist, studio, workshop, in, the, woman, s, building, of, los, ngeles, had, an, impact, in, the, wave, of, feminist, acts, but, until, 1980, they, did, not, completely, fuse, the, conjunction, between, feminism, and, performance, art, progressed, through, the, last, decade, in, the, first, two, decades, of, performance, art, development, works, that, had, not, been, conceived, as, feminist, are, seen, as, such, now, still, not, until, 1980, did, artists, self, define, themselves, as, feminists, artist, groups, in, which, women, influenced, by, the, 1968, student, movement, as, well, as, the, feminist, movement, stood, out, this, connection, has, been, treated, in, contemporary, art, history, research, some, of, the, women, whose, innovative, input, in, representations, and, shows, was, the, most, relevant, were, pina, bausch, and, the, guerrilla, girls, who, emerged, in, 1985, in, new, york, city, anonymous, feminist, and, anti, racist, art, collective, they, chose, that, name, because, they, used, guerrilla, tactics, in, their, activism, to, denounce, discrimination, against, women, in, art, through, political, and, performance, art, their, first, performance, was, placing, posters, and, making, public, appearances, in, museums, and, galleries, in, new, york, to, critique, the, fact, that, some, groups, of, people, were, discriminated, against, for, their, gender, or, race, all, of, this, was, done, anonymously, in, all, of, these, appearances, they, covered, their, faces, with, gorilla, masks, this, was, due, to, the, similar, pronunciation, of, the, words, gorilla, and, guerrilla, they, used, as, nicknames, the, names, of, female, artists, who, had, died, from, the, 1970s, until, the, 1980s, amongst, the, works, that, challenged, the, system, and, their, usual, strategies, of, representation, the, main, ones, feature, women, s, bodies, such, as, ana, mendieta, s, works, in, new, york, city, where, her, body, is, outraged, and, abused, or, the, artistic, representations, by, louise, bourgeois, with, a, rather, minimalist, discourse, that, emerge, in, the, late, seventies, and, eighties, special, mention, to, the, works, created, with, feminine, and, feminist, corporeity, such, as, lynda, benglis, and, her, phallic, performative, actions, who, reconstructed, the, feminine, image, to, turn, it, into, more, than, a, fetish, through, feminist, performance, art, the, body, becomes, a, space, for, developing, these, new, discourses, and, meanings, artist, eleanor, antin, creator, in, the, 1970s,
