robin, hood, is, a, legendary, heroic, outlaw, originally, depicted, in, english, folklore, and, subsequently, featured, in, literature, theatre, and, cinema, he, stole, from, the, rich, and, gave, to, the, poor, according, to, legend, he, was, a, highly, skilled, archer, and, swordsman, in, some, versions, of, the, legend, he, is, depicted, as, being, of, noble, birth, and, in, modern, retellings, he, is, sometimes, depicted, as, having, fought, in, the, crusades, before, returning, to, england, to, find, his, lands, taken, by, the, sheriff, in, the, oldest, known, versions, he, is, instead, a, member, of, the, yeoman, class, he, is, traditionally, depicted, dressed, in, lincoln, green, through, retellings, additions, and, variations, a, body, of, familiar, characters, associated, with, robin, hood, has, been, created, these, include, his, lover, maid, marian, his, band, of, outlaws, the, merry, men, and, his, chief, opponent, the, sheriff, of, nottingham, the, sheriff, is, often, depicted, as, assisting, prince, john, in, usurping, the, rightful, but, absent, king, richard, to, whom, robin, hood, remains, loyal, he, became, a, popular, folk, figure, in, the, late, middle, ages, and, his, partisanship, of, the, common, people, and, opposition, to, the, sheriff, are, some, of, the, earliest, recorded, features, of, the, legend, whereas, his, political, interests, and, setting, during, the, angevin, era, developed, in, later, centuries, the, earliest, known, ballads, featuring, him, are, from, the, 15th, century, there, have, been, numerous, variations, and, adaptations, of, the, story, over, the, subsequent, years, and, the, story, continues, to, be, widely, represented, in, literature, film, and, television, media, today, robin, hood, is, considered, one, of, the, best, known, tales, of, english, folklore, in, popular, culture, the, term, robin, hood, is, often, used, to, describe, a, heroic, outlaw, or, rebel, against, tyranny, the, origins, of, the, legend, as, well, as, the, historical, context, have, been, debated, for, centuries, there, are, numerous, references, to, historical, figures, with, similar, names, that, have, been, proposed, as, possible, evidence, of, his, existence, some, dating, back, to, the, late, 13th, century, at, least, eight, plausible, origins, to, the, story, have, been, mooted, by, historians, and, folklorists, including, suggestions, that, robin, hood, was, a, stock, alias, used, by, or, in, reference, to, bandits, the, first, clear, reference, to, rhymes, of, robin, hood, is, from, the, alliterative, poem, piers, plowman, thought, to, have, been, composed, in, the, 1370s, followed, shortly, afterwards, by, a, quotation, of, a, later, common, proverb, many, men, speak, of, robin, hood, and, never, shot, his, bow, in, friar, daw, s, reply, c, 1402, and, a, complaint, in, dives, and, pauper, 1405, 1410, that, people, would, rather, listen, to, tales, and, songs, of, robin, hood, than, attend, mass, robin, hood, is, also, mentioned, in, a, famous, lollard, tract, dated, to, the, first, half, of, the, fifteenth, century, thus, also, possibly, predating, his, other, earliest, historical, mentions, alongside, several, other, folk, heroes, such, as, guy, of, warwick, bevis, of, hampton, and, sir, lybeaus, however, the, earliest, surviving, copies, of, the, narrative, ballads, that, tell, his, story, date, to, the, second, half, of, the, 15th, century, or, the, first, decade, of, the, 16th, century, in, these, early, accounts, robin, hood, s, partisanship, of, the, lower, classes, his, devotion, to, the, virgin, mary, and, associated, special, regard, for, women, his, outstanding, skill, as, an, archer, his, anti, clericalism, and, his, particular, animosity, towards, the, sheriff, of, nottingham, are, already, clear, little, john, much, the, miller, s, son, and, will, scarlet, as, will, scarlok, or, scathelocke, all, appear, although, not, yet, maid, marian, or, friar, tuck, the, friar, has, been, part, of, the, legend, since, at, least, the, later, 15th, century, when, he, is, mentioned, in, a, robin, hood, play, script, in, modern, popular, culture, robin, hood, is, typically, seen, as, a, contemporary, and, supporter, of, the, late, 12th, century, king, richard, the, lionheart, robin, being, driven, to, outlawry, during, the, misrule, of, richard, s, brother, john, while, richard, was, away, at, the, third, crusade, this, view, first, gained, currency, in, the, 16th, century, it, is, not, supported, by, the, earliest, ballads, the, early, compilation, a, gest, of, robyn, hode, names, the, king, as, edward, and, while, it, does, show, robin, hood, accepting, the, king, s, pardon, he, later, repudiates, it, and, returns, to, the, greenwood, the, oldest, surviving, ballad, robin, hood, and, the, monk, gives, even, less, support, to, the, picture, of, robin, hood, as, a, partisan, of, the, true, king, the, setting, of, the, early, ballads, is, usually, attributed, by, scholars, to, either, the, 13th, century, or, the, 14th, although, it, is, recognised, they, are, not, necessarily, historically, consistent, the, early, ballads, are, also, quite, clear, on, robin, hood, s, social, status, he, is, a, yeoman, while, the, precise, meaning, of, this, term, changed, over, time, including, free, retainers, of, an, aristocrat, and, small, landholders, it, always, referred, to, commoners, the, essence, of, it, in, the, present, context, was, neither, a, knight, nor, a, peasant, or, husbonde, but, something, in, between, artisans, such, as, millers, were, among, those, regarded, as, yeomen, in, the, 14th, century, from, the, 16th, century, on, there, were, attempts, to, elevate, robin, hood, to, the, nobility, such, as, in, richard, grafton, s, chronicle, at, large, anthony, munday, presented, him, at, the, very, end, of, the, century, as, the, earl, of, huntingdon, in, two, extremely, influential, plays, as, he, is, still, commonly, presented, in, modern, times, as, well, as, ballads, the, legend, was, also, transmitted, by, robin, hood, games, or, plays, that, were, an, important, part, of, the, late, medieval, and, early, modern, may, day, festivities, the, first, record, of, a, robin, hood, game, was, in, 1426, in, exeter, but, the, reference, does, not, indicate, how, old, or, widespread, this, custom, was, at, the, time, the, robin, hood, games, are, known, to, have, flourished, in, the, later, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, it, is, commonly, stated, as, fact, that, maid, marian, and, a, jolly, friar, at, least, partly, identifiable, with, friar, tuck, entered, the, legend, through, the, may, games, the, earliest, surviving, text, of, a, robin, hood, ballad, is, the, 15th, century, robin, hood, and, the, monk, this, is, preserved, in, cambridge, university, manuscript, ff, 5, 48, written, after, 1450, it, contains, many, of, the, elements, still, associated, with, the, legend, from, the, nottingham, setting, to, the, bitter, enmity, between, robin, and, the, local, sheriff, the, first, printed, version, is, a, gest, of, robyn, hode, c, 1500, a, collection, of, separate, stories, that, attempts, to, unite, the, episodes, into, a, single, continuous, narrative, after, this, comes, robin, hood, and, the, potter, contained, in, a, manuscript, of, c, 1503, the, potter, is, markedly, different, in, tone, from, the, monk, whereas, the, earlier, tale, is, a, thriller, the, latter, is, more, comic, its, plot, involving, trickery, and, cunning, rather, than, straightforward, force, other, early, texts, are, dramatic, pieces, the, earliest, being, the, fragmentary, robyn, hod, and, the, shryff, off, notyngham, c, 1475, these, are, particularly, noteworthy, as, they, show, robin, s, integration, into, may, day, rituals, towards, the, end, of, the, middle, ages, robyn, hod, and, the, shryff, off, notyngham, among, other, points, of, interest, contains, the, earliest, reference, to, friar, tuck, the, plots, of, neither, the, monk, nor, the, potter, are, included, in, the, gest, and, neither, is, the, plot, of, robin, hood, and, guy, of, gisborne, which, is, probably, at, least, as, old, as, those, two, ballads, although, preserved, in, a, more, recent, copy, each, of, these, three, ballads, survived, in, a, single, copy, so, it, is, unclear, how, much, of, the, medieval, legend, has, survived, and, what, has, survived, may, not, be, typical, of, the, medieval, legend, it, has, been, argued, that, the, fact, that, the, surviving, ballads, were, preserved, in, written, form, in, itself, makes, it, unlikely, they, were, typical, in, particular, stories, with, an, interest, for, the, gentry, were, by, this, view, more, likely, to, be, preserved, the, story, of, robin, s, aid, to, the, poor, knight, that, takes, up, much, of, the, gest, may, be, an, example, the, character, of, robin, in, these, first, texts, is, rougher, edged, than, in, his, later, incarnations, in, robin, hood, and, the, monk, for, example, he, is, shown, as, quick, tempered, and, violent, assaulting, little, john, for, defeating, him, in, an, archery, contest, in, the, same, ballad, much, the, miller, s, son, casually, kills, a, little, page, in, the, course, of, rescuing, robin, hood, from, prison, no, extant, early, ballad, actually, shows, robin, hood, giving, to, the, poor, although, in, a, gest, of, robyn, hode, robin, does, make, a, large, loan, to, an, unfortunate, knight, which, he, does, not, in, the, end, require, to, be, repaid, and, later, in, the, same, ballad, robin, hood, states, his, intention, of, giving, money, to, the, next, traveller, to, come, down, the, road, if, he, happens, to, be, poor, of, my, good, he, shall, haue, some, yf, he, be, a, por, man, as, it, happens, the, next, traveller, is, not, poor, but, it, seems, in, context, that, robin, hood, is, stating, a, general, policy, the, first, explicit, statement, to, the, effect, that, robin, hood, habitually, robbed, from, the, rich, to, give, the, poor, can, be, found, in, john, stow, s, annales, of, england, 1592, about, a, century, after, the, publication, of, the, gest, but, from, the, beginning, robin, hood, is, on, the, side, of, the, poor, the, gest, quotes, robin, hood, as, instructing, his, men, that, when, they, rob, loke, ye, do, no, husbonde, harme, that, tilleth, with, his, ploughe, no, more, ye, shall, no, gode, yeman, that, walketh, by, gren, wode, shawe, ne, no, knyght, ne, no, squyer, that, wol, be, a, gode, felawe, and, in, its, final, lines, the, gest, sums, up, he, was, a, good, outlawe, and, dyde, pore, men, moch, god, within, robin, hood, s, band, medieval, forms, of, courtesy, rather, than, modern, ideals, of, equality, are, generally, in, evidence, in, the, early, ballad, robin, s, men, usually, kneel, before, him, in, strict, obedience, in, a, gest, of, robyn, hode, the, king, even, observes, that, his, men, are, more, at, his, byddynge, then, my, men, be, at, myn, their, social, status, as, yeomen, is, shown, by, their, weapons, they, use, swords, rather, than, quarterstaffs, the, only, character, to, use, a, quarterstaff, in, the, early, ballads, is, the, potter, and, robin, hood, does, not, take, to, a, staff, until, the, 17th, century, robin, hood, and, little, john, the, political, and, social, assumptions, underlying, the, early, robin, hood, ballads, have, long, been, controversial, j, c, holt, influentially, argued, that, the, robin, hood, legend, was, cultivated, in, the, households, of, the, gentry, and, that, it, would, be, mistaken, to, see, in, him, a, figure, of, peasant, revolt, he, is, not, a, peasant, but, a, yeoman, and, his, tales, make, no, mention, of, the, complaints, of, the, peasants, such, as, oppressive, taxes, he, appears, not, so, much, as, a, revolt, against, societal, standards, as, an, embodiment, of, them, being, generous, pious, and, courteous, opposed, to, stingy, worldly, and, churlish, foes, other, scholars, have, by, contrast, stressed, the, subversive, aspects, of, the, legend, and, see, in, the, medieval, robin, hood, ballads, a, plebeian, literature, hostile, to, the, feudal, order, by, the, early, 15th, century, at, the, latest, robin, hood, had, become, associated, with, may, day, celebrations, with, revellers, dressing, as, robin, or, as, members, of, his, band, for, the, festivities, this, was, not, common, throughout, england, but, in, some, regions, the, custom, lasted, until, elizabethan, times, and, during, the, reign, of, henry, viii, was, briefly, popular, at, court, robin, was, often, allocated, the, role, of, a, may, king, presiding, over, games, and, processions, but, plays, were, also, performed, with, the, characters, in, the, roles, sometimes, performed, at, church, ales, a, means, by, which, churches, raised, funds, a, complaint, of, 1492, brought, to, the, star, chamber, accuses, men, of, acting, riotously, by, coming, to, a, fair, as, robin, hood, and, his, men, the, accused, defended, themselves, on, the, grounds, that, the, practice, was, a, long, standing, custom, to, raise, money, for, churches, and, they, had, not, acted, riotously, but, peaceably, it, is, from, the, association, with, the, may, games, that, robin, s, romantic, attachment, to, maid, marian, or, marion, apparently, stems, a, robin, and, marion, figured, in, 13th, century, french, pastourelles, of, which, jeu, de, robin, et, marion, c, 1280, is, a, literary, version, and, presided, over, the, french, may, festivities, this, robin, and, marion, tended, to, preside, in, the, intervals, of, the, attempted, seduction, of, the, latter, by, a, series, of, knights, over, a, variety, of, rustic, pastimes, in, the, jeu, de, robin, and, marion, robin, and, his, companions, have, to, rescue, marion, from, the, clutches, of, a, lustful, knight, this, play, is, distinct, from, the, english, legends, although, dobson, and, taylor, regard, it, as, highly, probable, that, this, french, robin, s, name, and, functions, travelled, to, the, english, may, games, where, they, fused, with, the, robin, hood, legend, both, robin, and, marian, were, certainly, associated, with, may, day, festivities, in, england, as, was, friar, tuck, but, these, may, have, been, originally, two, distinct, types, of, performance, alexander, barclay, in, his, ship, of, fools, writing, in, c, 1500, refers, to, some, merry, fytte, of, maid, marian, or, else, of, robin, hood, but, the, characters, were, brought, together, marian, did, not, immediately, gain, the, unquestioned, role, in, robin, hood, s, birth, breeding, valor, and, marriage, his, sweetheart, is, clorinda, the, queen, of, the, shepherdesses, clorinda, survives, in, some, later, stories, as, an, alias, of, marian, the, earliest, preserved, script, of, a, robin, hood, play, is, the, fragmentary, robyn, hod, and, the, shryff, off, notyngham, this, apparently, dates, to, the, 1470s, and, circumstantial, evidence, suggests, it, was, probably, performed, at, the, household, of, sir, john, paston, this, fragment, appears, to, tell, the, story, of, robin, hood, and, guy, of, gisborne, there, is, also, an, early, playtext, appended, to, a, 1560, printed, edition, of, the, gest, this, includes, a, dramatic, version, of, the, story, of, robin, hood, and, the, curtal, friar, and, a, version, of, the, first, part, of, the, story, of, robin, hood, and, the, potter, neither, of, these, ballads, is, known, to, have, existed, in, print, at, the, time, and, there, is, no, earlier, record, known, of, the, curtal, friar, story, the, publisher, describes, the, text, as, a, playe, of, robyn, hood, verye, proper, to, be, played, in, maye, games, but, does, not, seem, to, be, aware, that, the, text, actually, contains, two, separate, plays, an, especial, point, of, interest, in, the, friar, play, is, the, appearance, of, a, ribald, woman, who, is, unnamed, but, apparently, to, be, identified, with, the, bawdy, maid, marian, of, the, may, games, she, does, not, appear, in, extant, versions, of, the, ballad, james, vi, of, scotland, was, entertained, by, a, robin, hood, play, at, dirleton, castle, produced, by, his, favourite, the, earl, of, arran, in, may, 1585, while, there, was, plague, in, edinburgh, in, 1598, anthony, munday, wrote, a, pair, of, plays, on, the, robin, hood, legend, the, downfall, and, the, death, of, robert, earl, of, huntington, published, 1601, these, plays, drew, on, a, variety, of, sources, including, apparently, a, gest, of, robin, hood, and, were, influential, in, fixing, the, story, of, robin, hood, to, the, period, of, richard, i, stephen, thomas, knight, has, suggested, that, munday, drew, heavily, on, fulk, fitz, warin, a, historical, 12th, century, outlawed, nobleman, and, enemy, of, king, john, in, creating, his, robin, hood, the, play, identifies, robin, hood, as, robert, earl, of, huntingdon, following, in, richard, grafton, s, association, of, robin, hood, with, the, gentry, and, identifies, maid, marian, with, one, of, the, semi, mythical, matildas, persecuted, by, king, john, the, plays, are, complex, in, plot, and, form, the, story, of, robin, hood, appearing, as, a, play, within, a, play, presented, at, the, court, of, henry, viii, and, written, by, the, poet, priest, and, courtier, john, skelton, skelton, himself, is, presented, in, the, play, as, acting, the, part, of, friar, tuck, some, scholars, have, conjectured, that, skelton, may, have, indeed, written, a, lost, robin, hood, play, for, henry, viii, s, court, and, that, this, play, may, have, been, one, of, munday, s, sources, henry, viii, himself, with, eleven, of, his, nobles, had, impersonated, robyn, hodes, men, as, part, of, his, maying, in, 1510, robin, hood, is, known, to, have, appeared, in, a, number, of, other, lost, and, extant, elizabethan, plays, in, 1599, the, play, george, a, green, the, pinner, of, wakefield, places, robin, hood, in, the, reign, of, edward, iv, edward, i, a, play, by, george, peele, first, performed, in, 1590, 91, incorporates, a, robin, hood, game, played, by, the, characters, llywelyn, the, great, the, last, independent, prince, of, wales, is, presented, playing, robin, hood, fixing, the, robin, hood, story, to, the, 1190s, had, been, first, proposed, by, john, major, in, his, historia, majoris, britanni, 1521, and, he, also, may, have, been, influenced, in, so, doing, by, the, story, of, warin, this, was, the, period, in, which, king, richard, was, absent, from, the, country, fighting, in, the, third, crusade, william, shakespeare, makes, reference, to, robin, hood, in, his, late, 16th, century, play, the, two, gentlemen, of, verona, in, it, the, character, valentine, is, banished, from, milan, and, driven, out, through, the, forest, where, he, is, approached, by, outlaws, who, upon, meeting, him, desire, him, as, their, leader, they, comment, by, the, bare, scalp, of, robin, hood, s, fat, friar, this, fellow, were, a, king, for, our, wild, faction, robin, hood, is, also, mentioned, in, as,

writing, jonson, s, only, pastoral, drama, it, was, written, in, sophisticated, verse, and, included, supernatural, action, and, characters, it, has, had, little, impact, on, the, robin, hood, tradition, but, earns, mention, as, the, work, of, a, major, dramatist, the, 1642, london, theatre, closure, by, the, puritans, interrupted, the, portrayal, of, robin, hood, on, the, stage, the,

appeared, on, the, 18th, century, stage, in, various, farces, and, comic, operas, alfred, lord, tennyson, would, write, a, four, act, robin, hood, play, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, the, forrestors, it, is, fundamentally, based, on, the, gest, but, follows, the, traditions, of, placing, robin, hood, as, the, earl, of, huntingdon, in, the, time, of, richard, i, and, making, the, sheriff, of, nottingham, and, prince, john, rivals, with, robin, hood, for, maid, marian, s, hand, the, return, of, king, richard, brings, a, happy, ending, with, the, advent, of, printing, came, the, robin, hood, broadside, ballads, exactly, when, they, displaced, the, oral, tradition, of, robin, hood, ballads, is, unknown, but, the, process, seems, to, have, been, completed, by, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, near, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, an, unpublished, prose, life, of, robin, hood, was, written, and, included, in, the, sloane, manuscript, largely, a, paraphrase, of, the, gest, it, also, contains, material, revealing, that, the, author, was, familiar, with, early, versions, of, a, number, of, the, robin, hood, broadside, ballads, not, all, of, the, medieval, legend, was, preserved, in, the, broadside, ballads, there, is, no, broadside, version, of, robin, hood, and, guy, of, gisborne, or, of, robin, hood, and, the, monk, which, did, not, appear, in, print, until, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, respectively, however, the, gest, was, reprinted, from, time, to, time, throughout, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, no, surviving, broadside, ballad, can, be, dated, with, certainty, before, the, 17th, century, but, during, that, century, the, commercial, broadside, ballad, became, the, main, vehicle, for, the, popular, robin, hood, legend, these, broadside, ballads, were, in, some, cases, newly, fabricated, but, were, mostly, adaptations, of, the, older, verse, narratives, the, broadside, ballads, were, fitted, to, a, small, repertoire, of, pre, existing, tunes, resulting, in, an, increase, of, stock, formulaic, phrases, making, them, repetitive, and, verbose, they, commonly, feature, robin, hood, s, contests, with, artisans, tinkers, tanners, and, butchers, among, these, ballads, is, robin, hood, and, little, john, telling, the, famous, story, of, the, quarter, staff, fight, between, the, two, outlaws, dobson, and, taylor, wrote, more, generally, the, robin, of, the, broadsides, is, a, much, less, tragic, less, heroic, and, in, the, last, resort, less, mature, figure, than, his, medieval, predecessor, in, most, of, the, broadside, ballads, robin, hood, remains, a, plebeian, figure, a, notable, exception, being, martin, parker, s, attempt, at, an, overall, life, of, robin, hood, a, true, tale, of, robin, hood, which, also, emphasises, the, theme, of, robin, hood, s, generosity, to, the, poor, more, than, the, broadsheet, ballads, do, in, general, the, 17th, century, introduced, the, minstrel, alan, a, dale, he, first, appeared, in, a, 17th, century, broadside, ballad, and, unlike, many, of, the, characters, thus, associated, managed, to, adhere, to, the, legend, the, prose, life, of, robin, hood, in, sloane, manuscript, contains, the, substance, of, the, alan, a, dale, ballad, but, tells, the, story, about, will, scarlet, in, the, 18th, century, the, stories, began, to, develop, a, slightly, more, farcical, vein, from, this, period, there, are, a, number, of, ballads, in, which, robin, is, severely, drubbed, by, a, succession, of, tradesmen, including, a, tanner, a, tinker, and, a, ranger, in, fact, the, only, character, who, does, not, get, the, better, of, hood, is, the, luckless, sheriff, yet, even, in, these, ballads, robin, is, more, than, a, mere, simpleton, on, the, contrary, he, often, acts, with, great, shrewdness, the, tinker, setting, out, to, capture, robin, only, manages, to, fight, with, him, after, he, has, been, cheated, out, of, his, money, and, the, arrest, warrant, he, is, carrying, in, robin, hood, s, golden, prize, robin, disguises, himself, as, a, friar, and, cheats, two, priests, out, of, their, cash, even, when, robin, is, defeated, he, usually, tricks, his, foe, into, letting, him, sound, his, horn, summoning, the, merry, men, to, his, aid, when, his, enemies, do, not, fall, for, this, ruse, he, persuades, them, to, drink, with, him, instead, see, robin, hood, s, delight, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, the, robin, hood, ballads, were, mostly, sold, in, garlands, of, 16, to, 24, robin, hood, ballads, these, were, crudely, printed, chap, books, aimed, at, the, poor, the, garlands, added, nothing, to, the, substance, of, the, legend, but, ensured, that, it, continued, after, the, decline, of, the, single, broadside, ballad, in, the, 18th, century, also, robin, hood, frequently, appeared, in, criminal, biographies, and, histories, of, highwaymen, compendia, in, 1765, thomas, percy, bishop, of, dromore, published, reliques, of, ancient, english, poetry, including, ballads, from, the, 17th, century, percy, folio, manuscript, which, had, not, previously, been, printed, most, notably, robin, hood, and, guy, of, gisborne, which, is, generally, regarded, as, in, substance, a, genuine, late, medieval, ballad, in, 1795, joseph, ritson, published, an, enormously, influential, edition, of, the, robin, hood, ballads, robin, hood, a, collection, of, all, the, ancient, poems, songs, and, ballads, now, extant, relative, to, that, celebrated, outlaw, by, providing, english, poets, and, novelists, with, a, convenient, source, book, ritson, gave, them, the, opportunity, to, recreate, robin, hood, in, their, own, imagination, ritson, s, collection, included, the, gest, and, put, the, robin, hood, and, the, potter, ballad, in, print, for, the, first, time, the, only, significant, omission, was, robin, hood, and, the, monk, which, would, eventually, be, printed, in, 1806, in, all, ritson, printed, 33, robin, hood, ballads, and, a, 34th, now, commonly, known, as, robin, hood, and, the, prince, of, aragon, that, he, included, as, the, second, part, of, robin, hood, newly, revived, which, he, had, retitled, robin, hood, and, the, stranger, ritson, s, interpretation, of, robin, hood, was, also, influential, having, influenced, the, modern, concept, of, stealing, from, the, rich, and, giving, to, the, poor, as, it, exists, today, himself, a, supporter, of, the, principles, of, the, french, revolution, and, admirer, of, thomas, paine, ritson, held, that, robin, hood, was, a, genuinely, historical, and, genuinely, heroic, character, who, had, stood, up, against, tyranny, in, the, interests, of, the, common, people, j, c, holt, has, been, quick, to, point, out, however, that, ritson, began, as, a, jacobite, and, ended, as, a, jacobin, and, certainly, reconstructed, him, in, the, image, of, a, radical, in, his, preface, to, the, collection, ritson, assembled, an, account, of, robin, hood, s, life, from, the, various, sources, available, to, him, and, concluded, that, robin, hood, was, born, in, around, 1160, and, thus, had, been, active, in, the, reign, of, richard, i, he, thought, that, robin, was, of, aristocratic, extraction, with, at, least, some, pretension, to, the, title, of, earl, of, huntingdon, that, he, was, born, in, an, unlocated, nottinghamshire, village, of, locksley, and, that, his, original, name, was, robert, fitzooth, ritson, gave, the, date, of, robin, hood, s, death, as, 18, november, 1247, when, he, would, have, been, around, 87, years, old, in, copious, and, informative, notes, ritson, defends, every, point, of, his, version, of, robin, hood, s, life, in, reaching, his, conclusion, ritson, relied, or, gave, weight, to, a, number, of, unreliable, sources, such, as, the, robin, hood, plays, of, anthony, munday, and, the, sloane, manuscript, nevertheless, dobson, and, taylor, credit, ritson, with, having, an, incalculable, effect, in, promoting, the, still, continuing, quest, for, the, man, behind, the, myth, and, note, that, his, work, remains, an, indispensable, handbook, to, the, outlaw, legend, even, now, ritson, s, friend, walter, scott, used, ritson, s, anthology, collection, as, a, source, for, his, picture, of, robin, hood, in, ivanhoe, written, in, 1818, which, did, much, to, shape, the, modern, legend, in, the, decades, following, the, publication, of, ritson, s, book, other, ballad, collections, would, occasionally, publish, stray, robin, hood, ballads, ritson, had, missed, in, 1806, robert, jamieson, published, the, earliest, known, robin, hood, ballad, robin, hood, and, the, monk, in, volume, ii, of, his, popular, ballads, and, songs, from, tradition, in, 1846, the, percy, society, included, the, bold, pedlar, and, robin, hood, in, its, collection, ancient, poems, ballads, and, songs, of, the, peasantry, of, england, in, 1850, john, mathew, gutch, published, his, own, collection, of, robin, hood, ballads, robin, hood, garlands, and, ballads, with, the, tale, of, the, lytell, geste, that, in, addition, to, all, of, ritson, s, collection, also, included, robin, hood, and, the, pedlars, and, robin, hood, and, the, scotchman, in, 1858, francis, james, child, published, his, english, and, scottish, ballads, which, included, a, volume, grouping, all, the, robin, hood, ballads, in, one, volume, including, all, the, ballads, published, by, ritson, the, four, stray, ballads, published, since, then, as, well, as, some, ballads, that, either, mentioned, robin, hood, by, name, or, featured, characters, named, robin, hood, but, weren, t, traditional, robin, hood, stories, for, his, more, scholarly, work, the, english, and, scottish, popular, ballads, in, his, volume, dedicated, to, the, robin, hood, ballads, published, in, 1888, child, removed, the, ballads, from, his, earlier, work, that, weren, t, traditional, robin, hood, stories, gave, the, ballad, ritson, titled, robin, hood, and, the, stranger, back, its, original, published, title, robin, hood, newly, revived, and, separated, what, ritson, had, printed, as, the, second, part, of, robin, hood, and, the, stranger, as, its, own, separate, ballad, robin, hood, and, the, prince, of, aragon, he, also, included, alternate, versions, of, ballads, that, had, distinct, alternate, versions, he, numbered, these, 38, robin, hood, ballads, among, the, 305, ballads, in, his, collection, as, child, ballads, nos, 117, 154, which, is, how, they, re, often, referenced, in, scholarly, works, in, the, 19th, century, the, robin, hood, legend, was, first, specifically, adapted, for, children, children, s, editions, of, the, garlands, were, produced, and, in, 1820, a, children, s, edition, of, ritson, s, robin, hood, collection, was, published, children, s, novels, began, to, appear, shortly, thereafter, it, is, not, that, children, did, not, read, robin, hood, stories, before, but, this, is, the, first, appearance, of, a, robin, hood, literature, specifically, aimed, at, them, a, very, influential, example, of, these, children, s, novels, was, pierce, egan, the, younger, s, robin, hood, and, little, john, 1840, this, was, adapted, into, french, by, alexandre, dumas, in, le, prince, des, voleurs, 1872, and, robin, hood, le, proscrit, 1873, egan, made, robin, hood, of, noble, birth, but, raised, by, the, forestor, gilbert, hood, another, very, popular, version, for, children, was, howard, pyle, s, the, merry, adventures, of, robin, hood, which, influenced, accounts, of, robin, hood, through, the, 20th, century, pyle, s, version, firmly, stamp, robin, as, a, staunch, philanthropist, a, man, who, takes, from, the, rich, to, give, to, the, poor, nevertheless, the, adventures, are, still, more, local, than, national, in, scope, while, king, richard, s, participation, in, the, crusades, is, mentioned, in, passing, robin, takes, no, stand, against, prince, john, and, plays, no, part, in, raising, the, ransom, to, free, richard, these, developments, are, part, of, the, 20th, century, robin, hood, myth, pyle, s, robin, hood, is, a, yeoman, and, not, an, aristocrat, the, idea, of, robin, hood, as, a, high, minded, saxon, fighting, norman, lords, also, originates, in, the, 19th, century, the, most, notable, contributions, to, this, idea, of, robin, are, jacques, nicolas, augustin, thierry, s, histoire, de, la, conqu, te, de, l, angleterre, par, les, normands, 1825, and, sir, walter, scott, s, ivanhoe, 1819, in, this, last, work, in, particular, the, modern, robin, hood, king, of, outlaws, and, prince, of, good, fellows, as, richard, the, lionheart, calls, him, makes, his, debut, in, 1993, a, previously, unknown, manuscript, of, 21, robin, hood, ballads, including, two, versions, of, the, jolly, pinder, of, wakefield, turned, up, in, an, auction, house, and, eventually, wound, up, in, the, british, library, called, the, forresters, manuscript, after, the, first, and, last, ballads, which, are, both, titled, robin, hood, and, the, forresters, it, was, published, in, 1998, as, robin, hood, the, forresters, manuscript, it, appears, to, have, been, written, in, the, 1670s, while, all, the, ballads, in, the, manuscript, had, already, been, known, and, published, during, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, although, most, of, the, ballads, in, the, manuscript, have, different, titles, then, ones, they, have, listed, under, the, child, ballads, 13, of, the, ballads, in, forresters, are, noticeably, different, from, how, they, appeared, in, the, broadsides, and, garlands, 9, of, these, ballads, are, significantly, longer, and, more, elaborate, than, the, versions, of, the, same, ballads, found, in, the, broadsides, and, garlands, for, four, of, these, ballads, the, forresters, manuscript, versions, are, the, earliest, known, versions, the, 20th, century, grafted, still, further, details, on, to, the, original, legends, the, 1938, film, the, adventures, of, robin, hood, starring, errol, flynn, and, olivia, de, havilland, portrayed, robin, as, a, hero, on, a, national, scale, leading, the, oppressed, saxons, in, revolt, against, their, norman, overlords, while, richard, the, lionheart, fought, in, the, crusades, this, movie, established, itself, so, definitively, that, many, studios, resorted, to, movies, about, his, son, invented, for, that, purpose, rather, than, compete, with, the, image, of, this, one, in, 1953, during, the, mccarthy, era, a, republican, member, of, the, indiana, textbook, commission, called, for, a, ban, of, robin, hood, from, all, indiana, school, books, for, its, alleged, communist, connotations, this, proposal, prompted, a, short, lived, college, protest, against, mccarthyism, and, book, censorship, in, the, united, states, that, was, launched, on, the, indiana, university, bloomington, campus, and, within, a, course, of, weeks, had, grown, into, a, nationwide, campus, movement, known, as, the, green, feather, movement, in, the, 1973, animated, disney, film, robin, hood, the, title, character, is, portrayed, as, an, anthropomorphic, fox, voiced, by, brian, bedford, years, before, robin, hood, had, even, entered, production, disney, had, considered, doing, a, project, on, reynard, the, fox, however, due, to, concerns, that, reynard, was, unsuitable, as, a, hero, animator, ken, anderson, adapted, some, elements, from, reynard, into, robin, hood, making, the, title, character, a, fox, the, 1976, british, american, film, robin, and, marian, starring, sean, connery, as, robin, hood, and, audrey, hepburn, as, maid, marian, portrays, the, figures, in, later, years, after, robin, has, returned, from, service, with, richard, the, lionheart, in, a, foreign, crusade, and, marian, has, gone, into, seclusion, in, a, nunnery, this, is, the, first, in, popular, culture, to, portray, king, richard, as, less, than, perfect, since, the, 1980s, it, has, become, commonplace, to, include, a, saracen, arab, muslim, among, the, merry, men, a, trend, that, began, with, the, character, nasir, in, the, 1984, itv, robin, of, sherwood, television, series, later, versions, of, the, story, have, followed, suit, a, version, of, nasir, appears, in, the, 1991, movie, robin, hood, prince, of, thieves, azeem, and, the, 2006, bbc, tv, series, robin, hood, djaq, spoofs, have, also, followed, this, trend, with, the, 1990s, bbc,

medieval, poems, and, the, latter, broadside, ballads, and, garlands, have, been, edited, and, translated, for, the, very, first, time, in, french, in, 2017, by, jonathan, fruoco, until, then, the, texts, had, been, unavailable, in, france, the, historicity, of, robin, hood, has, been, debated, for, centuries, a, difficulty, with, any, such, historical, research, is, that, robert, was, a, very, common, given, name, in, medieval, england, and, robin, or, robyn, was, its, very, common, diminutive, especially, in, the, 13th, century, it, is, a, french, hypocorism, already, mentioned, in, the, roman, de, renart, in, the, 12th, century, the, surname, hood, by, any, spelling, was, also, fairly, common, because, it, referred, either, to, a, hooder, who, was, a, maker, of, hoods, or, alternatively, to, somebody, who, wore, a, hood, as, a, head, covering, it, is, therefore, unsurprising, that, medieval, records, mention, a, number, of, people, called, robert, hood, or, robin, hood, some, of, whom, are, known, criminals, another, view, on, the, origin, of, the, name, is, expressed, in, the, 1911, encyclop, dia, britannica, which, remarks, that, hood, was, a, common, dialectical, form, of, wood, compare, dutch, hout, dutch, pronunciation, also, meaning, wood, and, that, the, outlaw, s, name, has, been, given, as, robin, wood, there, are, a, number, of, references, to, robin, hood, as, robin, wood, or, whood, or, whod, from, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, the, earliest, recorded, example, in, connection, with, may, games, in, somerset, dates, from, 1518, the, oldest, references, to, robin, hood, are, not, historical, records, or, even, ballads, recounting, his, exploits, but, hints, and, allusions, found, in, various, works, from, 1261, onward, the, names, robinhood, robehod, or, robbehod, occur, in, the, rolls, of, several, english, justices, as, nicknames, or, descriptions, of, malefactors, the, majority, of, these, references, date, from, the, late, 13th, century, between, 1261, and, 1300, there, are, at, least, eight, references, to, rabunhod, in, various, regions, across, england, from, berkshire, in, the, south, to, york, in, the, north, leaving, aside, the, reference, to, the, rhymes, of, robin, hood, in, piers, plowman, in, the, 1370s, and, the, scattered, mentions, of, his, tales, and, songs, in, various, religious, tracts, dating, to, the, early, 15th, century, the, first, mention, of, a, quasi, historical, robin, hood, is, given, in, andrew, of, wyntoun, s, orygynale, chronicle, written, in, about, 1420, the, following, lines, occur, with, little, contextualisation, under, the, year, 1283, lytil, jhon, and, robyne, hude, wayth, men, ware, commendyd, gude, in, yngil, wode, and, barnysdale, thai, oysyd, all, this, tyme, thare, trawale, in, a, petition, presented, to, parliament, in, 1439, the, name, is, used, to, describe, an, itinerant, felon, the, petition, cites, one, piers, venables, of, aston, derbyshire, who, having, no, liflode, ne, sufficeante, of, goodes, gadered, and, assembled, unto, him, many, misdoers, beynge, of, his, clothynge, and, in, manere, of, insurrection, wente, into, the, wodes, in, that, countrie, like, as, it, hadde, be, robyn, hude, and, his, meyne, the, next, historical, description, of, robin, hood, is, a, statement, in, the, scotichronicon, composed, by, john, of, fordun, between, 1377, and, 1384, and, revised, by, walter, bower, in, about, 1440, among, bower, s, many, interpolations, is, a, passage, that, directly, refers, to, robin, it, is, inserted, after, fordun, s, account, of, the, defeat, of, simon, de, montfort, and, the, punishment, of, his, adherents, and, is, entered, under, the, year, 1266, in, bower, s, account, robin, is, represented, as, a, fighter, for, de, montfort, s, cause, this, was, in, fact, true, of, the, historical, outlaw, of, sherwood, forest, roger, godberd, whose, points, of, similarity, to, the, robin, hood, of, the, ballads, have, often, been, noted, then, arose, the, famous, murderer, robert, hood, as, well, as, little, john, together, with, their, accomplices, from, among, the, disinherited, whom, the, foolish, populace, are, so, inordinately, fond, of, celebrating, both, in, tragedies, and, comedies, and, about, whom, they, are, delighted, to, hear, the, jesters, and, minstrels, sing, above, all, other, ballads, the, word, translated, here, as, murderer, is, the, latin, sicarius, literally, dagger, man, but, actually, meaning, in, classical, latin, assassin, or, murderer, from, the, latin, sica, for, dagger, and, descends, from, its, use, to, describe, the, sicarii, assassins, operating, in, roman, judea, bower, goes, on, to, relate, an, anecdote, about, robin, hood, in, which, he, refuses, to, flee, from, his, enemies, while, hearing, mass, in, the, greenwood, and, then, gains, a, surprise, victory, over, them, apparently, as, a, reward, for, his, piety, the, mention, of, tragedies, suggests, that, some, form, of, the, tale, relating, his, death, as, per, a, gest, of, robyn, hode, might, have, been, in, currency, already, another, reference, discovered, by, julian, luxford, in, 2009, appears, in, the, margin, of, the, polychronicon, in, the, eton, college, library, written, around, the, year, 1460, by, a, monk, in, latin, it, says, around, this, time, according, to, popular, opinion, a, certain, outlaw, named, robin, hood, with, his, accomplices, infested, sherwood, and, other, law, abiding, areas, of, england, with, continuous, robberies, following, this, john, major, mentions, robin, hood, within, his, historia, majoris, britanni, 1521, casting, him, in, a, positive, light, by, mentioning, his, and, his, followers, aversion, to, bloodshed, and, ethos, of, only, robbing, the, wealthy, major, also, fixed, his, floruit, not, to, the, mid, 13th, century, but, the, reigns, of, richard, i, of, england, and, his, brother, king, john, richard, grafton, in, his, chronicle, at, large, 1569, went, further, when, discussing, major, s, description, of, robert, hood, identifying, him, for, the, first, time, as, a, member, of, the, gentry, albeit, possibly, being, of, a, base, stock, and, linaege, was, for, his, manhood, and, chivalry, advanced, to, the, noble, dignity, of, an, earl, and, not, the, yeomanry, foreshadowing, anthony, munday, s, casting, of, him, as, the, dispossessed, earl, of, huntingdon, the, name, nevertheless, still, had, a, reputation, of, sedition, and, treachery, in, 1605, when, guy, fawkes, and, his, associates, were, branded, robin, hoods, by, robert, cecil, in, 1644, jurist, edward, coke, described, robin, hood, as, a, historical, figure, who, had, operated, in, the, reign, of, king, richard, i, around, yorkshire, he, interpreted, the, contemporary, term, roberdsmen, outlaws, as, meaning, followers, of, robin, hood, the, earliest, known, legal, records, mentioning, a, person, called, robin, hood, robert, hod, are, from, 1226, found, in, the, york, assizes, when, that, person, s, goods, worth, 32, shillings, and, 6, pence, were, confiscated, and, he, became, an, outlaw, robert, hod, owed, the, money, to, st, peter, s, in, york, the, following, year, he, was, called, hobbehod, and, also, came, to, known, as, robert, hood, robert, hod, of, york, is, the, only, early, robin, hood, known, to, have, been, an, outlaw, in, 1936, l, v, d, owen, floated, the, idea, that, robin, hood, might, be, identified, with, an, outlawed, robert, hood, or, hod, or, hobbehod, all, apparently, the, same, man, referred, to, in, nine, successive, yorkshire, pipe, rolls, between, 1226, and, 1234, there, is, no, evidence, however, that, this, robert, hood, although, an, outlaw, was, also, a, bandit, historian, oscar, de, ville, discusses, the, career, of, john, deyville, and, his, brother, robert, along, with, their, kinsmen, jocelin, and, adam, during, the, second, barons, war, specifically, their, activities, after, the, battle, of, evesham, john, deyville, was, granted, authority, by, the, faction, led, by, simon, de, montfort, 6th, earl, of, leicester, over, york, castle, and, the, northern, forests, during, the, war, in, which, they, sought, refuge, after, evesham, john, along, with, his, relatives, led, the, remaining, rebel, faction, on, the, isle, of, ely, following, the, dictum, of, kenilworth, de, ville, connects, their, presence, there, with, bower, s, mention, of, robert, hood, during, the, aftermath, of, evesham, in, his, annotations, to, the, scotichronicon, while, john, was, eventually, pardoned, and, continued, his, career, until, 1290, his, kinsmen, are, no, longer, mentioned, by, historical, records, after, the, events, surrounding, their, resistance, at, ely, and, de, ville, speculates, that, robert, remained, an, outlaw, other, points, de, ville, raises, in, support, of, john, and, his, brothers, exploits, forming, the, inspiration, for, robin, hood, include, their, properties, in, barnsdale, john, s, settlement, of, a, mortgage, worth, 400, paralleling, robin, hood, s, charity, of, identical, value, to, sir, richard, at, the, lee, relationship, with, sir, richard, foliot, a, possible, inspiration, for, the, former, figure, and, ownership, of, a, fortified, home, at, hood, hill, near, kilburn, north, yorkshire, the, last, of, these, is, suggested, to, be, the, inspiration, for, robin, hood, s, second, name, as, opposed, to, the, more, common, theory, of, a, head, covering, perhaps, not, coincidentally, a, robertus, hod, is, mentioned, in, records, among, the, holdouts, at, ely, although, de, ville, does, not, explicitly, connect, john, and, robert, deyville, to, robin, hood, he, discusses, these, parallels, in, detail, and, suggests, that, they, formed, prototypes, for, this, ideal, of, heroic, outlawry, during, the, tumultuous, reign, of, henry, iii, s, grandson, and, edward, i, s, son, edward, ii, of, england, david, baldwin, identifies, robin, hood, with, the, historical, outlaw, roger, godberd, who, was, a, die, hard, supporter, of, simon, de, montfort, which, would, place, robin, hood, around, the, 1260s, there, are, certainly, parallels, between, godberd, s, career, and, that, of, robin, hood, as, he, appears, in, the, gest, john, maddicott, has, called, godberd, that, prototype, robin, hood, some, problems, with, this, theory, are, that, there, is, no, evidence, that, godberd, was, ever, known, as, robin, hood, and, no, sign, in, the, early, robin, hood, ballads, of, the, specific, concerns, of, de, montfort, s, revolt, the, antiquarian, joseph, hunter, 1783, 1861, believed, that, robin, hood, had, inhabited, the, forests, of, yorkshire, during, the, early, decades, of, the, fourteenth, century, hunter, pointed, to, two, men, whom, believing, them, to, be, the, same, person, he, identified, with, the, legendary, outlaw, hunter, developed, a, fairly, detailed, theory, implying, that, robert, hood, had, been, an, adherent, of, the, rebel, earl, of, lancaster, who, was, defeated, by, edward, ii, at, the, battle, of, boroughbridge, in, 1322, according, to, this, theory, robert, hood, was, thereafter, pardoned, and, employed, as, a, bodyguard, by, king, edward, and, in, consequence, he, appears, in, the, 1323, court, roll, under, the, name, of, robyn, hode, hunter, s, theory, has, long, been, recognised, to, have, serious, problems, one, of, the, most, serious, being, that, recent, research, has, shown, that, hunter, s, robyn, hood, had, been, employed, by, the, king, before, he, appeared, in, the, 1323, court, roll, thus, casting, doubt, on, this, robyn, hood, s, supposed, earlier, career, as, outlaw, and, rebel, it, has, long, been, suggested, notably, by, john, maddicott, that, robin, hood, was, a, stock, alias, used, by, thieves, what, appears, to, be, the, first, known, example, of, robin, hood, as, a, stock, name, for, an, outlaw, dates, to, 1262, in, berkshire, where, the, surname, robehod, was, applied, to, a, man, apparently, because, he, had, been, outlawed, this, could, suggest, two, main, possibilities, either, that, an, early, form, of, the, robin, hood, legend, was, already, well, established, in, the, mid, 13th, century, or, alternatively, that, the, name, robin, hood, preceded, the, outlaw, hero, that, we, know, so, that, the, robin, hood, of, legend, was, so, called, because, that, was, seen, as, an, appropriate, name, for, an, outlaw, there, is, at, present, little, or, no, scholarly, support, for, the, view, that, tales, of, robin, hood, have, stemmed, from, mythology, or, folklore, from, fairies, or, other, mythological, origins, any, such, associations, being, regarded, as, later, development, it, was, once, a, popular, view, however, the, mythological, theory, dates, back, at, least, to, 1584, when, reginald, scot, identified, robin, hood, with, the, germanic, goblin, hudgin, or, hodekin, and, associated, him, with, robin, goodfellow, maurice, keen, provides, a, brief, summary, and, useful, critique, of, the, evidence, for, the, view, robin, hood, had, mythological, origins, while, the, outlaw, often, shows, great, skill, in, archery, swordplay, and, disguise, his, feats, are, no, more, exaggerated, than, those, of, characters, in, other, ballads, such, as, kinmont, willie, which, were, based, on, historical, events, robin, hood, has, also, been, claimed, for, the, pagan, witch, cult, supposed, by, margaret, murray, to, have, existed, in, medieval, europe, and, his, anti, clericalism, and, marianism, interpreted, in, this, light, the, existence, of, the, witch, cult, as, proposed, by, murray, is, now, generally, discredited, the, early, ballads, link, robin, hood, to, identifiable, real, places, in, popular, culture, robin, hood, and, his, band, of, merry, men, are, portrayed, as, living, in, sherwood, forest, in, nottinghamshire, notably, the, lincoln, cathedral, manuscript, which, is, the, first, officially, recorded, robin, hood, song, dating, from, approximately, 1420, makes, an, explicit, reference, to, the, outlaw, that, states, that, robyn, hode, in, scherewode, stod, in, a, similar, fashion, a, monk, of, witham, priory, 1460, suggested, that, the, archer, had, infested, shirwode, his, chronicle, entry, reads, around, this, time, according, to, popular, opinion, a, certain, outlaw, named, robin, hood, with, his, accomplices, infested, sherwood, and, other, law, abiding, areas, of, england, with, continuous, robberies, specific, sites, in, the, county, of, nottinghamshire, directly, linked, to, the, robin, hood, legend, include, robin, hood, s, well, near, newstead, abbey, within, the, boundaries, of, sherwood, forest, the, church, of, st, mary, in, the, village, of, edwinstowe, and, most, famously, of, all, the, major, oak, also, in, the, village, of, edwinstowe, the, major, oak, which, resides, in, the, heart, of, sherwood, forest, is, popularly, believed, to, have, been, used, by, the, merry, men, as, a, hide, out, dendrologists, have, contradicted, this, claim, by, estimating, the, tree, s, true, age, at, around, eight, hundred, years, it, would, have, been, relatively, a, sapling, in, robin, s, time, at, best, nottinghamshire, s, claim, to, robin, hood, s, heritage, is, disputed, with, yorkists, staking, a, claim, to, the, outlaw, in, demonstrating, yorkshire, s, robin, hood, heritage, the, historian, j, c, holt, drew, attention, to, the, fact, that, although, sherwood, forest, is, mentioned, in, robin, hood, and, the, monk, there, is, little, information, about, the, topography, of, the, region, and, thus, suggested, that, robin, hood, was, drawn, to, nottinghamshire, through, his, interactions, with, the, city, s, sheriff, moreover, the, linguist, lister, matheson, has, observed, that, the, language, of, the, gest, of, robyn, hode, is, written, in, a, definite, northern, dialect, probably, that, of, yorkshire, in, consequence, it, seems, probable, that, the, robin, hood, legend, actually, originates, from, the, county, of, yorkshire, robin, hood, s, yorkshire, origins, are, generally, accepted, by, professional, historians, a, tradition, dating, back, at, least, to, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, gives, robin, hood, s, birthplace, as, loxley, sheffield, in, south, yorkshire, the, original, robin, hood, ballads, which, originate, from, the, fifteenth, century, set, events, in, the, medieval, forest, of, barnsdale, barnsdale, was, a, wooded, area, covering, an, expanse, of, no, more, than, thirty, square, miles, ranging, six, miles, from, north, to, south, with, the, river, went, at, wentbridge, near, pontefract, forming, its, northern, boundary, and, the, villages, of, skelbrooke, and, hampole, forming, the, southernmost, region, from, east, to, west, the, forest, extended, about, five, miles, from, askern, on, the, east, to, badsworth, in, the, west, at, the, northernmost, edge, of, the, forest, of, barnsdale, in, the, heart, of, the, went, valley, resides, the, village, of, wentbridge, wentbridge, is, a, village, in, the, city, of, wakefield, district, of, west, yorkshire, england, it, lies, around, 3, miles, 5, km, southeast, of, its, nearest, township, of, size, pontefract, close, to, the, a1, road, during, the, medieval, age, wentbridge, was, sometimes, locally, referred, to, by, the, name, of, barnsdale, because, it, was, the, predominant, settlement, in, the, forest, wentbridge, is, mentioned, in, an, early, robin, hood, ballad, entitled, robin, hood, and, the, potter, which, reads, y, mete, hem, bot, at, went, breg, syde, lyttyl, john, and, while, wentbridge, is, not, directly, named, in, a, gest, of, robyn, hode, the, poem, does, appear, to, make, a, cryptic, reference, to, the, locality, by, depicting, a, poor, knight, explaining, to, robin, hood, that, he, went, at, a, bridge, where, there, was, wrestling, a, commemorative, blue, plaque, has, been, placed, on, the, bridge, that, crosses, the, river, went, by, wakefield, city, council, the, gest, makes, a, specific, reference, to, the, saylis, at, wentbridge, credit, is, due, to, the, nineteenth, century, antiquarian, joseph, hunter, who, correctly, identified, the, site, of, the, saylis, from, this, location, it, was, once, possible, to, look, out, over, the, went, valley, and, observe, the, traffic, that, passed, along, the, great, north, road, the, saylis, is, recorded, as, having, contributed, towards, the, aid, that, was, granted, to, edward, iii, in, 1346, 47, for, the, knighting, of, the, black, prince, an, acre, of, landholding, is, listed, within, a, glebe, terrier, of, 1688, relating, to, kirk, smeaton, which, later, came, to, be, called, sailes, close, professor, dobson, and, mr, taylor, indicate, that, such, evidence, of, continuity, makes, it, virtually, certain, that, the, saylis, that, was, so, well, known, to, robin, hood, is, preserved, today, as, sayles, plantation, it, is, this, location, that, provides, a, vital, clue, to, robin, hood, s, yorkshire, heritage, one, final, locality, in, the, forest, of, barnsdale, that, is, associated, with, robin, hood, is, the, village, of, campsall, the, historian, john, paul, davis, wrote, of, robin, s, connection, to, the, church, of, saint, mary, magdalene, at, campsall, in, south, yorkshire, a, gest, of, robyn, hode, states, that, the, outlaw, built, a, chapel, in, barnsdale, that, he, dedicated, to, mary, magdalene, i, made, a, chapel, in, bernysdale, that, seemly, is, to, se, it, is, of, mary, magdaleyne, and, thereto, wolde, i, be, davis, indicates, that, there, is, only, one, church, dedicated, to, mary, magdalene, within, what, one, might, reasonably, consider, to, have, been, the, medieval, forest, of, barnsdale, and, that, is, the, church, at, campsall, the, church, was, built, in, the, early, twelfth, century, by, robert, de, lacy, the, 2nd, baron, of, pontefract, local, legend, suggests, that, robin, hood, and, maid, marion, were, married, at, the, church, the, backdrop, of, st, mary, s, abbey, york, plays, a, central, role, in, the, gest, as, the, poor, knight, whom, robin, aids, owes, money, to, the, abbot, at, kirklees, priory, in, west, yorkshire, stands, an, alleged, grave, with, a, spurious, inscription, which, relates, to, robin, hood, the, fifteenth, century, ballads, relate, that, before, he, died, robin, told, little, john, where, to, bury, him, he, shot, an, arrow, from, the, priory, window, and, where, the, arrow, landed, was, to, be, the, site, of, his, grave, the, gest, states, that, the, prioress, was, a, relative, of, robin, s, robin, was, ill, and, staying, at, the, priory, where, the, prioress, was, supposedly, caring, for, him, however, she, betrayed, him, his, health, worsened, and, he, eventually, died, there, the, inscription, on, the, grave, reads, hear, underneath, dis, laitl, stean, laz, robert, earl, of, huntingtun, ne, er, arcir, ver, as, hie, sa, geud, an, pipl, kauld, im, robin, heud, sick, utlawz, as, he, an, iz, men, vil, england, nivr, si, agen, obiit, 24, kal, dekembris, 1247, despite, the, unconventional, spelling, the, verse, is, in, modern, english, not, the, middle, english, of, the, 13th, century, the, date, is, also, incorrectly, formatted, using, the, roman, calendar, 24, kal, decembris, would, be, the, twenty, third, day, before, the, beginning, of, december, that, is, 8, november, the, tomb, probably, dates, from, the, late, eighteenth, century, the, grave, with, the, inscription, is, within, sight, of, the, ruins, of, the, kirklees, priory, behind, the, three, nuns, pub, in, mirfield, west, yorkshire, though, local, folklore, suggests, that, robin, is, buried, in, the, grounds, of, kirklees, priory, this, theory, has, now, largely, been, abandoned, by, professional, historians, another, theory, is, that, robin, hood, died, at, kirkby, pontefract, michael, drayton, s, poly, olbion, song, 28, 67, 70, published, in, 1622, speaks, of, robin, hood, s, death, and, clearly, states, that, the, outlaw, died, at, kirkby, this, is, consistent, with, the, view, that, robin, hood, operated, in, the, went, valley, located, three, miles, to, the, southeast, of, the, town, of, pontefract, the, location, is, approximately, three, miles, from, the, site, of, robin, s, robberies, at, the, now, famous, saylis, in, the, anglo, saxon, period, kirkby, was, home, to, all, saints, church, pontefract, all, saints, church, had, a, priory, hospital, attached, to, it, the, tudor, historian, richard, grafton, stated, that, the, prioress, who, murdered, robin, hood, buried, the, outlaw, beside, the, road, where, he, had, used, to, rob, and, spoyle, those, that, passed, that, way, and, the, cause, why, she, buryed, him, there, was, for, that, common, strangers, and, travailers, knowing, and, seeing, him, there, buryed, might, more, safely, and, without, feare, take, their, journeys, that, way, which, they, durst, not, do, in, the, life, of, the, sayd, outlaes, all, saints, church, at, kirkby, modern, pontefract, which, was, located, approximately, three, miles, from, the, site, of, robin, hood, s, robberies, at, the, saylis, is, consistent, with, richard, grafton, s, description, because, a, road, ran, directly, from, wentbridge, to, the, hospital, at, kirkby, within, close, proximity, of, wentbridge, reside, several, notable, landmarks, relating, to, robin, hood, one, such, place, name, location, occurred, in, a, cartulary, deed, of, 1422, from, monkbretton, priory, which, makes, direct, reference, to, a, landmark, named, robin, hood, s, stone, which, resided, upon, the, eastern, side, of, the, great, north, road, a, mile, south, of, barnsdale, bar, the, historians, barry, dobson, and, john, taylor, suggested, that, on, the, opposite, side, of, the, road, once, stood, robin, hood, s, well, which, has, since, been, relocated, six, miles, north, west, of, doncaster, on, the, south, bound, side, of, the, great, north, road, over, the, next, three, centuries, the, name, popped, up, all, over, the, place, such, as, at, robin, hood, s, bay, near, whitby, in, yorkshire, robin, hood, s, butts, in, cumbria, and, robin, hood, s, walk, at, richmond, surrey, robin, hood, type, place, names, occurred, particularly, everywhere, except, sherwood, the, first, place, name, in, sherwood, does, not, appear, until, the, year, 1700, the, fact, that, the, earliest, robin, hood, type, place, names, originated, in, west, yorkshire, is, deemed, to, be, historically, significant, because, generally, place, name, evidence, originates, from, the, locality, where, legends, begin, the, overall, picture, from, the, surviving, early, ballads, and, other, early, references, indicate, that, robin, hood, was, based, in, the, barnsdale, area, of, what, is, now, south, yorkshire, which, borders, nottinghamshire, the, sheriff, of, nottingham, also, had, jurisdiction, in, derbyshire, that, was, known, as, the, shire, of, the, deer, and, this, is, where, the, royal, forest, of, the, peak, is, found, which, roughly, corresponds, to, today, s, peak, district, national, park, the, royal, forest, included, bakewell, tideswell, castleton, ladybower, and, the, derwent, valley, near, loxley, the, sheriff, of, nottingham, possessed, property, near, loxley, among, other, places, both, far, and, wide, including, hazlebadge, hall, peveril, castle, and, haddon, hall, mercia, to, which, nottingham, belonged, came, to, within, three, miles, of, sheffield, city, centre, but, before, the, law, of, the, normans, was, the, law, of, the, danes, the, danelaw, had, a, similar, boundary, to, that, of, mercia, but, had, a, population, of, free, peasantry, that, were, known, to, have, resisted, the, norman, occupation, many, outlaws, could, have, been, created, by, the, refusal, to, recognise, norman, forest, law, the, supposed, grave, of, little, john, can, be, found, in, hathersage, also, in, the, peak, district, further, indications, of, the, legend, s, connection, with, west, yorkshire, and, particularly, calderdale, are, noted, in, the, fact, that, there, are, pubs, called, the, robin, hood, in, both, nearby, brighouse, and, at, cragg, vale, higher, up, in, the, pennines, beyond, halifax, where, robin, hood, rocks, can, also, be, found, robin, hood, hill, is, near, outwood, west, yorkshire, not, far, from, lofthouse, there, is, a, village, in, west, yorkshire, called, robin, hood, on, the, a61, between, leeds, and, wakefield, and, close, to, rothwell, and, lofthouse, considering, these, references, to, robin, hood, it, is, not, surprising, that, the, people, of, both, south, and, west, yorkshire, lay, some, claim, to, robin, hood, who, if, he, existed, could, easily, have, roamed, between, nottingham, lincoln, doncaster, and, right, into, west, yorkshire, a, british, army, territorial, reserves, battalion, formed, in, nottingham, in, 1859, was, known, as, the, robin, hood, battalion, through, various, reorganisations, until, the, robin, hood, name, finally, disappeared, in, 1992, with, the, 1881, childers, reforms, that, linked, regular, and, reserve, units, into, regimental, families, the, robin, hood, battalion, became, part, of, the, sherwood, foresters, nottinghamshire, and, derbyshire, regiment, a, neolithic, causewayed, enclosure, on, salisbury, plain, has, acquired, the, name, robin, hood, s, ball, although, had, robin, hood, existed, it, is, doubtful, that, he, would, have, travelled, so, far, south, ballads, dating, back, to, the, 15th, century, are, the, oldest, existing, form, of, the, robin, hood, legends, although, none, of, them, were, recorded, at, the, time, of, the, first, allusions, to, him, and, many, are, from, much, later, they, share, many, common, features, often, opening, with, praise, of, the, greenwood, and, relying, heavily, on, disguise, as, a, plot, device, but, include, a, wide, variation, in, tone, and, plot, the, ballads, are, sorted, into, four, groups, very, roughly, according, to, date, of, first, known, free, standing, copy, ballads, whose, first, recorded, version, appears, usually, incomplete, in, the, percy, folio, may, appear, in, later, versions, and, may, be, much, older, than, the, mid, 17th, century, when, the, folio, was, compiled, any, ballad, may, be, older, than, the, oldest, copy, that, happens, to, survive, or, descended, from, a, lost, older, ballad, for, example, the, plot, of, robin, hood, s, death, found, in, the, percy, folio, is, summarised, in, the, 15th, century, a, gest, of, robyn, hode, and, it, also, appears, in, an, 18th, century, version, nb, the, first, two, ballads, listed, here, the, death, and, gisborne, although, preserved, in, 17th, century, copies, are, generally, agreed, to, preserve, the, substance, of, late, medieval, ballads, the, third, the, curtal, friar, and, the, fourth, the, butcher, also, probably, have, late, medieval, origins, an, before, a, ballad, s, title, indicates, there, s, also, a, version, of, this, ballad, in, the, forresters, manuscript, nb, an, before, a, ballad, s, title, indicates, that, the, forresters, version, of, this, ballad, is, the, earliest, known, version, some, ballads, such, as, erlinton, feature, robin, hood, in, some, variants, where, the, folk, hero, appears, to, be, added, to, a, ballad, pre, existing, him, and, in, which, he, does, not, fit, very, well, he, was, added, to, one, variant, of, rose, red, and, the, white, lily, apparently, on, no, more, connection, than, that, one, hero, of, the, other, variants, is, named, brown, robin, francis, james, child, indeed, retitled, child, ballad, 102, though, it, was, titled, the, birth, of, robin, hood, its, clear, lack, of, connection, with, the, robin, hood,
