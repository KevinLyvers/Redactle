and, kept, in, their, respective, compounds, in, case, of, banjar, ownership, the, instruments, are, all, kept, there, together, because, people, believe, that, all, the, instruments, belong, to, the, community, as, a, whole, and, that, no, one, person, has, ownership, over, an, instrument, not, only, is, this, where, the, instruments, are, stored, but, this, is, also, the, practice, space, for,

instructor, whose, job, it, is, in, the, community, to, lead, this, group, and, to, come, up, with, new, pieces, when, they, are, working, on, a, new, piece, the, instructor, will, lead, the, group,

groups, constantly, change, their, music, by, taking, older, pieces, they, know, and, mixing, them, together, as, well, as, trying, new, variations, of, the, music, their, music, constantly, changes, because, they, believe, that, music, should, grow, and, change, the, only, exception, to, this, is, with, their, most, sacred, songs, which, they, do, not, change, a, single, new, piece, of, music, can, take, several, months, before, it, is, completed, men, and, women, usually, perform, in, separate, groups, a, set, of, complete, balinese, gamelan, ensemble, consists, of, the, tuning, and, construction, of, a, gamelan, orchestra, is, a, complex, process, javanese, gamelan, use, two, tuning, systems, sl, ndro, and, p, log, there, are, other, tuning, systems, such, as, degung, exclusive, to, sunda, or, west, java, similar, to, a, japanese, ryukyuan, scale, and, madenda, similar, to, a, japanese, hirajoshi, scale, in, central, javanese, gamelan, sl, ndro, is, a, system, with, five, notes, to, the, octave, with, large, intervals, while, p, log, has, seven, notes, to, the, octave, with, uneven, intervals, usually, played, in, five, note, subsets, of, the, seven, tone, collection, a, full, gamelan, will, include, a, set, of, instruments, in, each, tuning, and, classically, only, one, tuning, is, used, at, a, time, the, precise, tuning, used, differs, from, ensemble, to, ensemble, and, gives, each, ensemble, its, own, particular, flavor, a, set, of, gamelan, instruments, will, be, tuned, to, the, same, set, of, notes, but, the, tuning, will, vary, from, one, gamelan, to, the, next, including, variations, in, the, size, of, intervals, colin, mcphee, a, canadian, composer, who, spent, much, time, in, bali, remarked, deviations, in, what, is, considered, the, same, scale, are, so, large, that, one, might, with, reason, state, that, there, are, as, many, scales, as, there, are, gamelans, this, view, is, contested, however, by, some, teachers, of, gamelan, and, there, have, been, efforts, to, combine, multiple, ensembles, and, tuning, structures, into, one, gamelan, to, ease, transportation, at, festival, time, one, such, ensemble, is, gamelan, manikasanti, which, can, play, the, repertoire, of, many, different, ensembles, balinese, gamelan, instruments, are, built, in, pairs, that, are, tuned, slightly, apart, to, produce, interference, beats, ideally, at, a, consistent, speed, for, all, pairs, of, notes, in, all, registers, this, concept, is, referred, to, as, ombak, translating, to, wave, communicating, the, idea, of, cyclical, undulation, one, instrument, tuned, slightly, higher, is, thought, of, as, the, inhale, and, the, other, slightly, lower, is, called, the, exhale, also, called, the, blower, and, the, sucker, or, pengimbang, and, pengisep, in, bali, when, the, inhale, and, the, exhale, are, combined, beating, is, produced, meant, to, represent, the, beating, of, the, heart, or, the, symbol, of, being, alive, it, is, thought, that, this, contributes, to, the, shimmering, sound, of, balinese, gamelan, ensembles, in, the, religious, ceremonies, that, contain, gamelan, these, interference, beats, are, meant, to, give, the, listener, a, feeling, of, a, god, s, presence, or, a, stepping, stone, to, a, meditative, state, the, scale, roughly, approximates, that, of, the, phrygian, mode, of, the, western, major, scale, e, e, on, the, white, keys, of, the, piano, with, the, notes, efgbc, corresponding, to, the, note, positions, 12356, in, the, slendro, scale, used, by, most, gamelan, in, addition, to, non, western, scales, javanese, gamelan, uses, a, combination, of, tempo, and, density, known, as, irama, relating, how, many, beats, on, the, saron, panerus, instrument, there, are, to, notes, in, the, core, melody, or, balungan, density, is, considered, primary, slendro, notation, generally, produces, a, light, cheerful, atmosphere, and, feels, busier, this, is, evidenced, by, the, scenes, in, the, wayang, kulit, and, wayang, wong, performances, such, as, scenes, of, war, and, marching, that, accompanied, by, slendro, notation, the, use, of, the, slendro, can, also, have, the, opposite, impression, such, as, sad, or, romantic, as, in, the, case, of, gending, that, uses, a, slendro, miring, slendro, miring, is, a, slendro, notation, tone, that, is, played, out, of, place, on, purpose, therefore, there, are, many, scenes, of, homesickness, love, missing, sadness, death, languishing, accompanied, by, slendro, tunes, pelog, notation, produces, an, atmosphere, that, gives, the, impression, of, being, manly, regal, and, sacred, especially, in, the, musical, play, that, uses, the, pelog, nem, six, notation, therefore, there, are, many, scenes, that, are, accompanied, by, pelog, tunings, such, as, scenes, where, a, king, enters, the, pamelegan, place, of, worship, scenes, of, heartache, scenes, of, anger, or, scenes, that, express, revenge, however, in, the, play, of, certain, notes, the, pelog, tunings, can, also, give, the, impression, of, being, happy, light, and, lively, for, example, in, the, music, played, on, the, pelog, tunings, of, barang, gamelan, music, is, traditionally, not, notated, and, began, as, an, oral, tradition, in, the, 19th, century, however, the, kraton, palaces, of, yogyakarta, and, surakarta, developed, distinct, notations, for, transcribing, the, repertoire, these, were, not, used, to, read, the, music, which, was, memorized, but, to, preserve, pieces, in, the, court, records, the, yogyanese, notation, is, a, checkerboard, notation, which, uses, six, or, seven, vertical, lines, to, represent, notes, of, higher, pitch, in, the, balungan, melodic, framework, and, horizontal, lines, which, represent, the, series, of, beats, read, downward, with, time, the, fourth, vertical, line, and, every, fourth, horizontal, line, completing, a, gatra, are, darkened, for, legibility, symbols, on, the, left, indicate, the, colotomic, or, metric, structure, of, gongs, and, so, forth, while, specific, drum, features, are, notated, in, symbols, to, the, right, the, solonese, notation, reads, horizontally, like, western, notation, but, does, not, use, barlines, instead, note, values, and, rests, are, squiggled, between, the, notes, today, this, notation, is, relatively, rare, and, has, been, replaced, by, kepatihan, notation, which, is, based, on, the, galin, paris, chev, system, kepatihan, notation, developed, around, 1900, at, the, kepatihan, palace, in, surakarta, which, had, become, a, high, school, conservatory, the, pitches, are, numbered, see, the, articles, on, the, scales, slendro, and, p, log, for, an, explanation, of, how, and, are, read, across, with, dots, below, or, above, the, numbers, indicating, the, register, and, lines, above, notes, showing, time, values, in, vocal, notation, there, are, also, brackets, under, groups, of, notes, to, indicate, melisma, like, the, palace, notation, however, kepatihan, records, mostly, the, balungan, part, and, its, metric, phrases, as, marked, by, a, variety, of, gongs, the, other, parts, are, created, in, real, time, and, depend, on, the, knowledge, each, musician, has, of, his, instrument, and, his, awareness, of, what, others, are, playing, this, realization, is, sometimes, called, garap, some, teachers, have, also, devised, certain, notations, generally, using, kepatihan, principles, for, the, cengkok, melodic, patterns, of, the, elaborating, instruments, some, ethnomusicologists, trained, in, european, music, may, make, transcriptions, onto, a, western, staff, this, entails, particular, challenges, of, tuning, and, time, sometimes, resulting, in, unusual, clefs, varieties, of, gamelan, are, distinguished, by, their, collection, of, instruments, and, use, of, voice, tunings, repertoire, style, and, cultural, context, in, general, no, two, gamelan, ensembles, are, the, same, and, those, that, arose, in, prestigious, courts, are, often, considered,
