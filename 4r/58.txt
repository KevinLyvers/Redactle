sometimes, even, a, bluish, hue, under, certain, lighting, conditions, this, effect, is, due, to, the, marble, s, surface, reacting, to, light, and, moisture, creating, a, magical, and, ever, changing, visual, experience, the, sky, has, not, only, been, incorporated, in, the, design, through, the, reflecting, pools, but, also, through, the, surface, of, the, building, itself, this, is, another, way, to, imply, the, presence, of, allah, at, the, site, according, to, ebba, koch, art, historian, and, international, expert, in, the, understanding, and, interpretation, of, mughal,

with, caravanserais, bazaars, and, markets, to, serve, the, needs, of, visitors, and, workers, lists, of, recommended, travel, destinations, often, feature, the, taj, mahal, which, also, appears, in, several, listings, of, seven, wonders, of, the, modern, world, including, the, new, seven, wonders, of, the, world, a, poll, conducted, in, 2007, foreign, dignitaries, often, visit, the, taj, mahal, on, trips, to, india, ever, since, its, construction, the, building, has, been, the, source, of, an, admiration, transcending, culture, and, geography, and, so, personal, and, emotional, responses, have, consistently, eclipsed, scholastic, appraisals, of, the, monument, a, longstanding, myth, holds, that, shah, jahan, planned, a, mausoleum, to, be, built, in, black, marble, as, a, black, taj, mahal, across, the, yamuna, river, the, idea, originates, from, fanciful, writings, of, jean, baptiste, tavernier, a, european, traveler, and, gem, merchant, who, visited, agra, in, 1665, it, was, suggested, that, his, son, aurangzeb, overthrew, shah, jahan, before, it, could, be, built, ruins, of, blackened, marble, across, the, river, in, the, mehtab, bagh, seeming, to, support, the, argument, were, however, proven, false, after, excavations, carried, out, in, the, 1990s, found, that, they, were, discolored, white, stones, that, had, turned, black, a, more, credible, theory, for, the, origins, of, the, black, mausoleum, was, demonstrated, in, 2006, by, archaeologists, who, reconstructed, part, of, the, pool, in, the, mehtab, bagh, a, dark, reflection, of, the, white, mausoleum, could, clearly, be, seen, befitting, shah, jahan, s, obsession, with, symmetry, and, the, positioning, of, the, pool, itself, no, concrete, evidence, exists, for, claims, that, describe, often, in, horrific, detail, the, deaths, dismemberment, and, mutilations, which, shah, jahan, supposedly, inflicted, on, various, architects, and, craftsmen, associated, with, the, tomb, some, stories, claim, that, those, involved, in, construction, signed, contracts, committing, themselves, to, have, no, part, in, any, similar, design, no, evidence, exists, for, claims, that, lord, william, bentinck, governor, general, of, india, in, the, 1830s, supposedly, planned, to, demolish, the, taj, mahal, and, auction, off, the, marble, bentinck, s, biographer, john, rosselli, says, that, the, story, arose, from, bentinck, s, fund, raising, sale, of, discarded, marble, from, agra, fort, another, myth, suggests, that, beating, the, silhouette, of, the, finial, will, cause, water, to, come, forth, to, this, day, officials, find, broken, bangles, surrounding, the, silhouette, several, myths, none, of, which, are, supported, by, the, archaeological, record, have, appeared, asserting, that, people, other, than, shah, jahan, and, the, original, architects, were, responsible, for, the, construction, of, the, taj, mahal, for, instance, in, 2000, india, s, supreme, court, dismissed, p, n, oak, s, petition, to, declare, that, a, hindu, king, built, the, taj, mahal, in, 2005, a, similar, petition, brought, by, amar, nath, mishra, a, social, worker, and, preacher, claiming, that, the, taj, mahal, was, built, by, the, hindu, king, paramardi, in, 1196, was, dismissed, by, the, allahabad, high, court, several, court, cases, and, statements, by, right, wing, politicians, about, taj, mahal, being, a, hindu, temple, have, been, inspired, by, p, n, oak, s, 1989, book, taj, mahal, the, true, story, in, which, he, claimed, it, was, built, in, 1155, ad, and, not, in, the, 17th, century, in, november, 2015, the, union, minister, of, culture, stated, in, the, indian, parliament, that, there, was, no, evidence, that, it, was, ever, a, temple, in, august, 2017, the, archaeological, survey, of, india, declared, that, there, was, no, evidence, to, suggest, the, monument, ever, housed, a, temple, another, such, unsupported, theory, that, the, taj, mahal, was, designed, by, an, italian, geronimo, vereneo, held, sway, for, a, brief, period, after, it, was, first, promoted, by, henry, george, keene, in, 1879, keene, went, by, a, translation, of, a, spanish, work, itinerario, the, travels, of, fray, sebastian, manrique, 1629, 1643, another, theory, that, a, frenchman, named, austin, of, bordeaux, designed, the, taj, was, promoted, by, william, henry, sleeman, based, on, the, work, of, jean, baptiste, tavernier, these, ideas, were, revived, by, father, hosten, and, discussed, again, by, e, b, havell, and, served, as, the, basis, for, subsequent, theories, and, controversies
