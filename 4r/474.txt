a, theatrical, culture, flourished, in, ancient, greece, from, 700, bc, at, its, centre, was, the, city, state, of, athens, which, became, a, significant, cultural, political, and, religious, place, during, this, period, and, the, theatre, was, institutionalised, there, as, part, of, a, festival, called, the, dionysia, which, honoured, the, god, dionysus, tragedy, late, 500, bc, comedy, 490, bc, and, the, satyr, play, were, the, three, dramatic, genres, emerged, there, athens, exported, the, festival, to, its, numerous, colonies, modern, western, theatre, comes, in, large, measure, from, the, theatre, of, ancient, greece, from, which, it, borrows, technical, terminology, classification, into, genres, and, many, of, its, themes, stock, characters, and, plot, elements, the, word, tragodia, from, which, the, word, tragedy, is, derived, is, a, compound, of, two, greek, words, tragos, or, goat, and, ode, meaning, song, from, aeidein, to, sing, this, etymology, indicates, a, link, with, the, practices, of, the, ancient, dionysian, cults, it, is, impossible, however, to, know, with, certainty, how, these, fertility, rituals, became, the, basis, for, tragedy, and, comedy, the, ancient, greeks, valued, the, power, of, the, spoken, word, and, it, was, their, main, method, of, communication, and, storytelling, bahn, and, bahn, write, to, greeks, the, spoken, word, was, a, living, thing, and, infinitely, preferable, to, the, dead, symbols, of, a, written, language, socrates, himself, believed, that, once, something, has, been, written, down, it, lost, its, ability, for, change, and, growth, for, these, reasons, among, many, others, oral, storytelling, flourished, in, greece, greek, tragedy, as, it, is, presently, known, was, created, in, athens, around, 532, bc, when, thespis, was, the, earliest, recorded, actor, being, a, winner, of, the, first, theatrical, contest, held, in, athens, he, was, the, exarchon, or, leader, of, the, dithyrambs, performed, in, and, around, attica, especially, at, the, rural, dionysia, by, thespis, time, the, dithyramb, had, evolved, far, away, from, its, cult, roots, under, the, influence, of, heroic, epic, doric, choral, lyric, and, the, innovations, of, the, poet, arion, it, had, become, a, narrative, ballad, like, genre, because, of, these, thespis, is, often, called, the, inventor, of, tragedy, however, his, importance, is, disputed, and, thespis, is, sometimes, listed, as, late, as, 16th, in, the, chronological, order, of, greek, tragedians, the, statesman, solon, for, example, is, credited, with, creating, poems, in, which, characters, speak, with, their, own, voice, and, spoken, performances, of, homer, s, epics, by, rhapsodes, were, popular, in, festivals, prior, to, 534, bc, thus, thespis, s, true, contribution, to, drama, is, unclear, at, best, but, his, name, has, been, given, a, longer, life, in, english, as, a, common, term, for, performer, i, e, a, thespian, the, dramatic, performances, were, important, to, the, athenians, this, is, made, clear, by, the, creation, of, a, tragedy, competition, and, festival, in, the, city, dionysia, or, great, dionysia, this, was, organized, possibly, to, foster, loyalty, among, the, tribes, of, attica, recently, created, by, cleisthenes, the, festival, was, created, roughly, around, 508, bc, while, no, drama, texts, exist, from, the, sixth, century, bc, the, names, of, three, competitors, besides, thespis, are, known, choerilus, pratinas, and, phrynichus, each, is, credited, with, different, innovations, in, the, field, some, information, is, known, about, phrynichus, he, won, his, first, competition, between, 511, bc, and, 508, bc, he, produced, tragedies, on, themes, and, subjects, later, exploited, in, the, golden, age, such, as, the, danaids, phoenician, women, and, alcestis, he, was, the, first, poet, we, know, of, to, use, a, historical, subject, his, fall, of, miletus, produced, in, 493, 2, chronicled, the, fate, of, the, town, of, miletus, after, it, was, conquered, by, the, persians, herodotus, reports, that, the, athenians, made, clear, their, deep, grief, for, the, taking, of, miletus, in, many, ways, but, especially, in, this, when, phrynichus, wrote, a, play, entitled, the, fall, of, miletus, and, produced, it, the, whole, theatre, fell, to, weeping, they, fined, phrynichus, a, thousand, drachmas, for, bringing, to, mind, a, calamity, that, affected, them, so, personally, and, forbade, the, performance, of, that, play, forever, he, is, also, thought, to, be, the, first, to, use, female, characters, though, not, female, performers, until, the, hellenistic, period, all, tragedies, were, unique, pieces, written, in, honour, of, dionysus, and, played, only, once, what, is, primarily, extant, today, are, the, pieces, that, were, still, remembered, well, enough, to, have, been, repeated, when, the, repetition, of, old, tragedies, became, fashionable, the, accidents, of, survival, as, well, as, the, subjective, tastes, of, the, hellenistic, librarians, later, in, greek, history, also, played, a, role, in, what, survived, from, this, period, after, the, achaemenid, destruction, of, athens, in, 480, bc, the, town, and, acropolis, were, rebuilt, and, theatre, became, formalized, and, an, even, greater, part, of, athenian, culture, and, civic, pride, this, century, is, normally, regarded, as, the, golden, age, of, greek, drama, the, center, piece, of, the, annual, dionysia, which, took, place, once, in, winter, and, once, in, spring, was, a, competition, between, three, tragic, playwrights, at, the, theatre, of, dionysus, each, submitted, three, tragedies, plus, a, satyr, play, a, comic, burlesque, version, of, a, mythological, subject, beginning, in, a, first, competition, in, 486, bc, each, playwright, submitted, a, comedy, aristotle, claimed, that, aeschylus, added, the, second, actor, deuteragonist, and, that, sophocles, introduced, the, third, tritagonist, apparently, the, greek, playwrights, never, used, more, than, three, actors, based, on, what, is, known, about, greek, theatre, tragedy, and, comedy, were, viewed, as, completely, separate, genres, and, no, plays, ever, merged, aspects, of, the, two, satyr, plays, dealt, with, the, mythological, subject, matter, of, the, tragedies, but, in, a, purely, comedic, manner, the, power, of, athens, declined, following, its, defeat, in, the, peloponnesian, war, against, sparta, from, that, time, on, the, theatre, started, performing, old, tragedies, again, although, its, theatrical, traditions, seem, to, have, lost, their, vitality, greek, theatre, continued, into, the, hellenistic, period, the, period, following, alexander, the, great, s, conquests, in, the, fourth, century, bc, the, primary, hellenistic, theatrical, form, was, not, tragedy, but, new, comedy, comic, episodes, about, the, lives, of, ordinary, citizens, the, only, extant, playwright, from, the, period, is, menander, one, of, new, comedy, s, most, important, contributions, was, its, influence, on, roman, comedy, an, influence, that, can, be, seen, in, the, surviving, works, of, plautus, and, terence, most, ancient, greek, cities, lay, on, or, near, hills, so, seating, was, generally, built, into, the, slope, of, a, hill, producing, a, natural, viewing, area, known, as, the, theatron, literally, seeing, place, in, cities, without, suitable, hills, banks, of, earth, were, piled, up, at, the, foot, of, the, hill, was, a, flattened, generally, circular, performance, space, with, an, average, diameter, of, 78, feet, 24, m, known, as, the, orchestra, literally, dancing, place, where, a, chorus, of, typically, 12, to, 15, people, performed, plays, in, verse, accompanied, by, music, there, were, often, tall, arched, entrances, called, parodoi, or, eisodoi, through, which, actors, and, chorus, members, entered, and, exited, the, orchestra, in, some, theatres, behind, the, orchestra, was, a, backdrop, or, scenic, wall, known, as, the, sken, the, term, theatre, eventually, came, to, mean, the, whole, area, of, theatron, orchestra, and, sken, the, theatron, was, the, seating, area, built, into, a, hill, to, create, a, natural, viewing, space, the, first, seats, in, greek, theatres, other, than, just, sitting, on, the, ground, were, wooden, but, around, 499, bc, the, practice, of, inlaying, stone, blocks, into, the, side, of, the, hill, to, create, permanent, stable, seating, became, more, common, they, were, called, the, prohedria, and, reserved, for, priests, and, a, few, of, the, most, respected, citizens, the, diazoma, separated, the, upper, and, lower, seating, areas, after, 465, bc, playwrights, began, using, a, backdrop, or, scenic, wall, called, the, sken, from, which, the, word, scene, derives, that, hung, or, stood, behind, the, orchestra, and, also, served, as, an, area, where, actors, could, change, their, costumes, after, 425, bc, a, stone, scene, wall, called, a, paraskenia, became, a, common, supplement, to, sken, the, paraskenia, was, a, long, wall, with, projecting, sides, which, may, have, had, doorways, for, entrances, and, exits, just, behind, the, paraskenia, was, the, proskenion, in, front, of, the, scene, which, is, similar, to, the, modern, day, proscenium, the, upper, story, was, called, the, episkenion, some, theatres, also, had, a, raised, speaking, place, on, the, orchestra, called, the, logeion, by, the, end, of, the, 5th, century, bc, around, the, time, of, the, peloponnesian, war, the, sken, was, two, stories, high, the, death, of, a, character, was, always, heard, behind, the, sken, for, it, was, considered, inappropriate, to, show, a, killing, in, view, of, the, audience, conversely, there, are, scholarly, arguments, that, death, in, greek, tragedy, was, portrayed, off, stage, primarily, because, of, dramatic, considerations, and, not, prudishness, or, sensitivity, of, the, audience, a, temple, nearby, especially, on, the, right, side, of, the, scene, is, almost, always, part, of, the, greek, theatre, complex, this, could, justify, as, a, transposition, the, recurrence, of, the, pediment, with, the, later, solidified, stone, scene, the, orchestra, was, a, circular, piece, of, ground, at, the, bottom, of, the, theatron, where, the, chorus, and, actors, performed, the, word, means, dancing, space, as, the, chorus, also, danced, in, early, periods, originally, unraised, greek, theatre, would, later, incorporate, a, raised, stage, for, easier, viewing, this, practice, would, become, common, after, the, advent, of, new, comedy, which, incorporated, dramatic, portrayal, of, individual, characters, the, coryphaeus, was, the, head, chorus, member, who, could, enter, the, story, as, a, character, able, to, interact, with, the, characters, of, a, play, plays, often, began, in, the, morning, and, lasted, into, the, evening, the, theatres, were, built, on, a, large, scale, to, accommodate, a, large, number, of, performers, on, stage, and, in, the, audience, up, to, fourteen, thousand, physics, and, mathematics, played, a, significant, role, in, the, construction, of, these, theatres, as, their, designers, had, to, be, able, to, create, acoustics, in, them, such, that, the, actors, voices, could, be, heard, throughout, the, theatre, including, the, very, top, row, of, seats, the, greek, s, understanding, of, acoustics, compares, very, favorably, with, the, current, state, of, the, art, there, were, several, scenic, elements, commonly, used, in, greek, theatre, the, ancient, greek, term, for, a, mask, is, prosopon, lit, face, and, was, a, significant, element, in, the, worship, of, dionysus, at, athens, likely, used, in, ceremonial, rites, and, celebrations, many, masks, worshipped, the, higher, power, the, gods, making, masks, also, very, important, for, religion, most, of, the, evidence, comes, from, only, a, few, vase, paintings, of, the, 5th, century, bc, such, as, one, showing, a, mask, of, the, god, suspended, from, a, tree, with, decorated, robe, hanging, below, it, and, dancing, and, the, pronomos, vase, which, depicts, actors, preparing, for, a, satyr, play, no, physical, evidence, remains, available, to, us, as, the, masks, were, made, of, organic, materials, and, not, considered, permanent, objects, ultimately, being, dedicated, at, the, altar, of, dionysus, after, performances, nevertheless, the, mask, is, known, to, have, been, used, since, the, time, of, aeschylus, and, considered, to, be, one, of, the, iconic, conventions, of, classical, greek, theatre, masks, were, also, made, for, members, of, the, chorus, who, play, some, part, in, the, action, and, provide, a, commentary, on, the, events, in, which, they, are, caught, up, although, there, are, twelve, or, fifteen, members, of, the, tragic, chorus, they, all, wear, the, same, mask, because, they, are, considered, to, be, representing, one, character, stylized, comedy, and, tragedy, masks, said, to, originate, in, ancient, greek, theatre, have, come, to, widely, symbolize, the, performing, arts, generally, illustrations, of, theatrical, masks, from, 5th, century, display, helmet, like, masks, covering, the, entire, face, and, head, with, holes, for, the, eyes, and, a, small, aperture, for, the, mouth, and, an, integrated, wig, these, paintings, never, show, actual, masks, on, the, actors, in, performance, they, are, most, often, shown, being, handled, by, the, actors, before, or, after, a, performance, this, demonstrates, the, way, in, which, the, mask, was, to, melt, into, the, face, and, allow, the, actor, to, vanish, into, the, role, effectively, the, mask, transformed, the, actor, as, much, as, memorization, of, the, text, therefore, performance, in, ancient, greece, did, not, distinguish, the, masked, actor, from, the, theatrical, character, the, mask, makers, were, called, skeuopoios, or, maker, of, the, props, thus, suggesting, that, their, role, encompassed, multiple, duties, and, tasks, the, masks, were, most, likely, made, out, of, light, weight, organic, materials, like, stiffened, linen, leather, wood, or, cork, with, the, wig, consisting, of, human, or, animal, hair, due, to, the, visual, restrictions, imposed, by, these, masks, it, was, imperative, that, the, actors, hear, in, order, to, orient, and, balance, themselves, thus, it, is, believed, that, the, ears, were, covered, by, substantial, amounts, of, hair, and, not, the, helmet, mask, itself, the, mouth, opening, was, relatively, small, preventing, the, mouth, being, seen, during, performances, vervain, and, wiles, posit, that, this, small, size, discourages, the, idea, that, the, mask, functioned, as, a, megaphone, as, originally, presented, in, the, 1960s, greek, mask, maker, thanos, vovolis, suggests, that, the, mask, serves, as, a, resonator, for, the, head, thus, enhancing, vocal, acoustics, and, altering, its, quality, this, leads, to, increased, energy, and, presence, allowing, for, the, more, complete, metamorphosis, of, the, actor, into, his, character, in, a, large, open, air, theatre, like, the, theatre, of, dionysus, in, athens, the, classical, masks, were, able, to, create, a, sense, of, dread, in, the, audience, creating, large, scale, panic, especially, since, they, had, intensely, exaggerated, facial, features, and, expressions, they, enabled, an, actor, to, appear, and, reappear, in, several, different, roles, thus, preventing, the, audience, from, identifying, the, actor, to, one, specific, character, their, variations, help, the, audience, to, distinguish, sex, age, and, social, status, in, addition, to, revealing, a, change, in, a, particular, character, s, appearance, e, g, oedipus, after, blinding, himself, unique, masks, were, also, created, for, specific, characters, and, events, in, a, play, such, as, the, furies, in, aeschylus, eumenides, and, pentheus, and, cadmus, in, euripides, the, bacchae, worn, by, the, chorus, the, masks, created, a, sense, of, unity, and, uniformity, while, representing, a, multi, voiced, persona, or, single, organism, and, simultaneously, encouraged, interdependency, and, a, heightened, sensitivity, between, each, individual, of, the, group, only, 2, to, 3, actors, were, allowed, on, the, stage, at, one, time, and, masks, permitted, quick, transitions, from, one, character, to, another, there, were, only, male, actors, but, masks, allowed, them, to, play, female, characters, the, modern, method, to, interpret, a, role, by, switching, between, a, few, simple, characters, goes, back, to, changing, masks, in, the, theatre, of, ancient, greece, the, actors, in, these, plays, that, had, tragic, roles, wore, boots, called, cothurnus, buskin, that, elevated, them, above, the, other, actors, the, actors, with, comedic, roles, only, wore, a, thin, soled, shoe, called, a, soccus, or, sock, for, this, reason, dramatic, art, is, sometimes, called, sock, and, buskin, male, actors, playing, female, roles, would, wear, a, wooden, structure, on, their, chests, posterneda, to, imitate, the, look, of, breasts, and, another, structure, on, their, stomachs, progastreda, to, make, them, appear, softer, and, more, lady, like, they, would, also, wear, white, body, stockings, under, their, costumes, to, make, their, skin, appear, fairer, most, costuming, detail, comes, from, pottery, paintings, from, that, time, as, costumes, and, masks, were, fabricated, out, of, disposable, material, so, there, are, little, to, no, remains, of, any, costume, from, that, time, the, biggest, source, of, information, is, the, pronomos, vase, where, actors, are, painted, at, a, show, s, after, party, costuming, would, give, off, a, sense, of, character, as, in, gender, age, social, status, and, class, for, example, characters, of, higher, class, would, be, dressed, in, nicer, clothing, although, everyone, was, dressed, fairly, nicely, contrary, to, popular, belief, they, did, not, dress, in, only, rags, and, sandals, as, they, wanted, to, impress, some, examples, of, greek, theatre, costuming, include, long, robes, called, chiton, that, reached, the, floor, for, actors, playing, gods, heroes, and, old, men, actors, playing, goddesses, and, women, characters, that, held, a, lot, of, power, wore, purple, and, gold, actors, playing, queens, and, princesses, wore, long, cloaks, that, dragged, on, the, ground, and, were, decorated, with, gold, stars, and, other, jewels, and, warriors, were, dressed, in, a, variety, of, armor, and, wore, helmets, adorned, with, plumes, costumes, were, supposed, to, be, colourful, and, obvious, to, be, easily, seen, by, every, seat, in, the, audience
