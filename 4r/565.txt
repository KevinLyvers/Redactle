las, meninas, spanish, for, the, ladies, in, waiting, pronounced, is, a, 1656, painting, in, the, museo, del, prado, in, madrid, by, diego, vel, zquez, the, leading, artist, of, the, spanish, baroque, it, has, become, one, of, the, most, widely, analyzed, works, in, western, painting, for, the, way, its, complex, and, enigmatic, composition, raises, questions, about, reality, and, illusion, and, for, the, uncertain, relationship, it, creates, between, the, viewer, and, the, figures, depicted, the, painting, is, believed, by, f, j, s, nchez, cant, n, to, depict, a, room, in, the, royal, alcazar, of, madrid, during, the, reign, of, king, philip, iv, of, spain, and, presents, several, figures, most, identifiable, from, the, spanish, court, captured, in, a, particular, moment, as, if, in, a, snapshot, some, of, the, figures, look, out, of, the, canvas, towards, the, viewer, while, others, interact, among, themselves, the, five, year, old, infanta, margaret, theresa, is, surrounded, by, her, entourage, of, maids, of, honour, chaperone, bodyguard, two, dwarfs, and, a, dog, just, behind, them, vel, zquez, portrays, himself, working, at, a, large, canvas, vel, zquez, looks, outwards, beyond, the, pictorial, space, to, where, a, viewer, of, the, painting, would, stand, in, the, background, there, is, a, mirror, that, reflects, the, upper, bodies, of, the, king, and, queen, they, appear, to, be, placed, outside, the, picture, space, in, a, position, similar, to, that, of, the, viewer, although, some, scholars, have, speculated, that, their, image, is, a, reflection, from, the, painting, vel, zquez, is, shown, working, on, las, meninas, has, long, been, recognised, as, one, of, the, most, important, paintings, in, the, history, of, western, art, the, baroque, painter, luca, giordano, said, that, it, represents, the, theology, of, painting, and, in, 1827, the, president, of, the, royal, academy, of, arts, sir, thomas, lawrence, described, the, work, in, a, letter, to, his, successor, david, wilkie, as, the, true, philosophy, of, the, art, more, recently, it, has, been, described, as, vel, zquez, s, supreme, achievement, a, highly, self, conscious, calculated, demonstration, of, what, painting, could, achieve, and, perhaps, the, most, searching, comment, ever, made, on, the, possibilities, of, the, easel, painting, in, 17th, century, spain, painters, rarely, enjoyed, high, social, status, painting, was, regarded, as, a, craft, not, an, art, such, as, poetry, or, music, nonetheless, vel, zquez, worked, his, way, up, through, the, ranks, of, the, court, of, philip, iv, and, in, february, 1651, was, appointed, palace, chamberlain, aposentador, mayor, del, palacio, the, post, brought, him, status, and, material, reward, but, its, duties, made, heavy, demands, on, his, time, during, the, remaining, eight, years, of, his, life, he, painted, only, a, few, works, mostly, portraits, of, the, royal, family, when, he, painted, las, meninas, he, had, been, with, the, royal, household, for, 33, years, philip, iv, s, first, wife, elizabeth, of, france, died, in, 1644, and, their, only, son, balthasar, charles, died, two, years, later, lacking, an, heir, philip, married, mariana, of, austria, in, 1649, and, margaret, theresa, 1651, 1673, was, their, first, child, and, their, only, one, at, the, time, of, the, painting, subsequently, she, had, a, short, lived, brother, philip, prospero, 1657, 1661, and, then, charles, 1661, 1700, arrived, who, succeeded, to, the, throne, as, charles, ii, at, the, age, of, three, vel, zquez, painted, portraits, of, mariana, and, her, children, and, although, philip, himself, resisted, being, portrayed, in, his, old, age, he, did, allow, vel, zquez, to, include, him, in, las, meninas, in, the, early, 1650s, he, gave, vel, zquez, the, pieza, principal, main, room, of, the, late, balthasar, charles, s, living, quarters, by, then, serving, as, the, palace, museum, to, use, as, his, studio, where, las, meninas, is, set, philip, had, his, own, chair, in, the, studio, and, would, often, sit, and, watch, vel, zquez, at, work, although, constrained, by, rigid, etiquette, the, art, loving, king, seems, to, have, had, a, close, relationship, with, the, painter, after, vel, zquez, s, death, philip, wrote, i, am, crushed, in, the, margin, of, a, memorandum, on, the, choice, of, his, successor, during, the, 1640s, and, 1650s, vel, zquez, served, as, both, court, painter, and, curator, of, philip, iv, s, expanding, collection, of, european, art, he, seems, to, have, been, given, an, unusual, degree, of, freedom, in, the, role, he, supervised, the, decoration, and, interior, design, of, the, rooms, holding, the, most, valued, paintings, adding, mirrors, statues, and, tapestries, he, was, also, responsible, for, the, sourcing, attribution, hanging, and, inventory, of, many, of, the, spanish, king, s, paintings, by, the, early, 1650s, vel, zquez, was, widely, respected, in, spain, as, a, connoisseur, much, of, the, collection, of, the, prado, today, including, works, by, titian, raphael, and, rubens, were, acquired, and, assembled, under, vel, zquez, s, curatorship, the, painting, was, referred, to, in, the, earliest, inventories, as, la, familia, the, family, las, meninas, is, described, in, the, inventory, of, 1666, by, garc, a, de, medrano, a, detailed, description, of, las, meninas, which, provides, the, identification, of, several, of, the, figures, was, published, by, antonio, palomino, the, giorgio, vasari, of, the, spanish, golden, age, in, 1724, examination, under, infrared, light, reveals, minor, pentimenti, that, is, there, are, traces, of, earlier, working, that, the, artist, himself, later, altered, for, example, at, first, vel, zquez, s, own, head, inclined, to, his, right, rather, than, his, left, the, painting, has, been, cut, down, on, both, the, left, and, right, sides, it, was, damaged, in, the, 1734, fire, that, destroyed, the, alc, zar, and, was, restored, by, court, painter, juan, garc, a, de, miranda, 1677, 1749, the, left, cheek, of, the, infanta, was, almost, completely, repainted, to, compensate, for, a, substantial, loss, of, pigment, after, its, rescue, from, the, fire, the, painting, was, inventoried, as, part, of, the, royal, collection, in, 1747, 48, and, the, infanta, was, misidentified, as, maria, theresa, margaret, theresa, s, older, half, sister, an, error, that, was, repeated, when, the, painting, was, inventoried, at, the, new, madrid, royal, palace, in, 1772, a, 1794, inventory, reverted, to, a, version, of, the, earlier, title, the, family, of, philip, iv, which, was, repeated, in, the, records, of, 1814, the, painting, entered, the, collection, of, the, museo, del, prado, on, its, foundation, in, 1819, in, 1843, the, prado, catalogue, listed, the, work, for, the, first, time, as, las, meninas, in, recent, years, the, picture, has, suffered, a, loss, of, texture, and, hue, due, to, exposure, to, pollution, and, crowds, of, visitors, the, once, vivid, contrasts, between, blue, and, white, pigments, in, the, costumes, of, the, meninas, have, faded, it, was, last, cleaned, in, 1984, under, the, supervision, of, the, american, conservator, john, brealey, to, remove, a, yellow, veil, of, dust, that, had, gathered, since, the, previous, restoration, in, the, 19th, century, the, cleaning, provoked, according, to, the, art, historian, federico, zeri, furious, protests, not, because, the, picture, had, been, damaged, in, any, way, but, because, it, looked, different, in, addition, he, spanish, press, criticized, brealey, at, every, opportunity, arguing, that, only, someone, born, and, raised, in, spain, could, truly, comprehend, and, be, allowed, to, handle, such, an, iconic, piece, of, their, culture, one, day, a, small, riot, broke, out, outside, the, room, where, brealey, was, working, however, in, the, opinion, of, l, pez, rey, the, restoration, was, impeccable, due, to, its, size, importance, and, value, the, painting, is, not, lent, out, for, exhibition, a, thorough, technical, investigation, including, a, pigment, analysis, of, las, meninas, was, conducted, around, 1981, in, the, museo, del, prado, the, analysis, revealed, the, usual, pigments, of, the, baroque, period, frequently, used, by, vel, zquez, in, his, other, paintings, the, main, pigments, used, for, this, painting, were, lead, white, azurite, for, the, skirt, of, the, kneeling, menina, vermilion, and, red, lake, ochres, and, carbon, blacks, las, meninas, is, set, in, vel, zquez, s, studio, in, philip, iv, s, alc, zar, palace, in, madrid, the, high, ceilinged, room, is, presented, in, the, words, of, silvio, gaggi, as, a, simple, box, that, could, be, divided, into, a, perspective, grid, with, a, single, vanishing, point, in, the, centre, of, the, foreground, stands, the, infanta, margaret, theresa, 1, the, five, year, old, infanta, who, later, married, holy, roman, emperor, leopold, i, was, at, this, point, philip, and, mariana, s, only, surviving, child, she, is, attended, by, two, ladies, in, waiting, or, meninas, do,

s, pertusato, 5, who, playfully, tries, to, rouse, a, sleepy, mastiff, with, his, foot, the, dog, is, thought, to, be, descended, from, two, mastiffs, from, lyme, hall, in, cheshire, given, to, philip, iii, in, 1604, by, james, i, of, england, do, a, marcela, de, ulloa, 6, the, princess, s, chaperone, stands, behind, them, dressed, in, mourning, and, talking, to, an, unidentified, bodyguard, or, guardadamas, 7, to, the, rear, and, at, right, stands, don, jos, nieto, vel, zquez, 8, the, queen, s, chamberlain, during, the, 1650s, and, head, of, the, royal, tapestry, works, who, may, have, been, a, relative, of, the, artist, nieto, is, shown, standing, but, in, pause, with, his, right, knee, bent, and, his, feet, on, different, steps, as, the, art, critic, harriet, stone, observes, it, is, uncertain, whether, he, is, coming, or, going, he, is, rendered, in, silhouette, and, appears, to, hold, open, a, curtain, on, a, short, flight, of, stairs, with, an, unclear, wall, or, space, behind, both, this, backlight, and, the, open, doorway, reveal, space, behind, in, the, words, of, the, art, historian, analisa, leppanen, they, lure, our, eyes, inescapably, into, the, depths, the, royal, couple, s, reflection, pushes, in, the, opposite, direction, forward, into, the, picture, space, the, vanishing, point, of, the, perspective, is, in, the, doorway, as, can, be, shown, by, extending, the, line, of, the, meeting, of, wall, and, ceiling, on, the, right, nieto, is, seen, only, by, the, king, and, queen, who, share, the, viewer, s, point, of, view, and, not, by, the, figures, in, the, foreground, in, the, footnotes, of, joel, snyder, s, article, the, author, recognizes, that, nieto, is, the, queen, s, attendant, and, was, required, to, be, at, hand, to, open, and, close, doors, for, her, snyder, suggests, that, nieto, appears, in, the, doorway, so, that, the, king, and, queen, might, depart, in, the, context, of, the, painting, snyder, argues, that, the, scene, is, the, end, of, the, royal, couple, s, sitting, for, vel, zquez, and, they, are, preparing, to, exit, explaining, that, is, why, the, menina, to, the, right, of, the, infanta, begins, to, curtsy, vel, zquez, himself, 9, is, pictured, to, the, left, of, the, scene, looking, outward, past, a, large, canvas, supported, by, an, easel, on, his, chest, is, the, red, cross, of, the, order, of, santiago, which, he, did, not, receive, until, 1659, three, years, after, the, painting, was, completed, according, to, palomino, philip, ordered, this, to, be, added, after, vel, zquez, s, death, and, some, say, that, his, majesty, himself, painted, it, from, the, painter, s, belt, hang, the, symbolic, keys, of, his, court, offices, a, mirror, on, the, back, wall, reflects, the, upper, bodies, and, heads, of, two, figures, identified, from, other, paintings, and, by, palomino, as, king, philip, iv, 10, and, queen, mariana, 11, the, most, common, assumption, is, that, the, reflection, shows, the, couple, in, the, pose, they, are, holding, for, vel, zquez, as, he, paints, them, while, their, daughter, watches, and, that, the, painting, therefore, shows, their, view, of, the, scene, of, the, nine, figures, depicted, five, are, looking, directly, out, at, the, royal, couple, or, the, viewer, their, glances, along, with, the, king, and, queen, s, reflection, affirm, the, royal, couple, s, presence, outside, the, painted, space, alternatively, art, historians, h, w, janson, and, joel, snyder, suggest, that, the, image, of, the, king, and, queen, is, a, reflection, from, vel, zquez, s, canvas, the, front, of, which, is, obscured, from, the, viewer, other, writers, say, the, canvas, vel, zquez, is, shown, working, on, is, unusually, large, for, one, of, his, portraits, and, note, that, is, about, the, same, size, as, las, meninas, the, painting, contains, the, only, known, double, portrait, of, the, royal, couple, painted, by, the, artist, the, point, of, view, of, the, picture, is, approximately, that, of, the, royal, couple, though, this, has, been, widely, debated, many, critics, suppose, that, the, scene, is, viewed, by, the, king, and, queen, as, they, pose, for, a, double, portrait, while, the, infanta, and, her, companions, are, present, only, to, make, the, process, more, enjoyable, ernst, gombrich, suggested, that, the, picture, might, have, been, the, sitters, idea, perhaps, the, princess, was, brought, into, the, royal, presence, to, relieve, the, boredom, of, the, sitting, and, the, king, or, the, queen, remarked, to, velazquez, that, here, was, a, worthy, subject, for, his, brush, the, words, spoken, by, the, sovereign, are, always, treated, as, a, command, and, so, we, may, owe, this, masterpiece, to, a, passing, wish, which, only, velazquez, was, able, to, turn, into, reality, no, single, theory, however, has, found, universal, agreement, leo, steinberg, suggests, that, the, king, and, queen, are, to, the, left, of, the, viewer, and, the, reflection, in, the, mirror, is, that, of, the, canvas, a, portrait, of, the, king, and, queen, clark, suggests, that, the, work, comprises, a, scene, where, the, ladies, in, waiting, are, attempting, to, cajole, the, infanta, do, a, margarita, to, pose, with, her, mother, and, father, in, his, 1960, book, looking, at, pictures, clark, writes, our, first, feeling, is, of, being, there, we, are, standing, just, to, the, right, of, the, king, and, queen, whose, reflections, we, can, see, in, the, distant, mirror, looking, down, an, austere, room, in, the, alc, zar, hung, with, del, mazo, s, copies, of, rubens, and, watching, a, familiar, situation, the, infanta, do, a, margarita, doesn, t, want, to, pose, she, is, now, five, years, old, and, she, has, had, enough, an, enormous, picture, so, big, that, it, stands, on, the, floor, in, which, she, is, going, to, appear, with, her, parents, and, somehow, the, infanta, must, be, persuaded, her, ladies, in, waiting, known, by, the, portuguese, name, of, meninas, are, doing, their, best, to, cajole, her, and, have, brought, her, dwarfs, maribarbola, and, nicolasito, to, amuse, her, but, in, fact, they, alarm, her, almost, as, much, as, they, alarm, us, the, back, wall, of, the, room, which, is, in, shadow, is, hung, with, rows, of, paintings, including, one, of, a, series, of, scenes, from, ovid, s, metamorphoses, by, rubens, and, copies, by, vel, zquez, s, son, in, law, and, principal, assistant, del, mazo, of, works, by, jacob, jordaens, the, paintings, are, shown, in, the, exact, positions, recorded, in, an, inventory, taken, around, this, time, the, wall, to, the, right, is, hung, with, a, grid, of, eight, smaller, paintings, visible, mainly, as, frames, owing, to, their, angle, from, the, viewer, they, can, be, identified, from, the, inventory, as, more, mazo, copies, of, paintings, from, the, rubens, ovid, series, though, only, two, of, the, subjects, can, be, seen, the, paintings, on, the, back, wall, are, recognized, as, representing, minerva, punishing, arachne, and, apollo, s, victory, over, marsyas, both, stories, involve, minerva, the, goddess, of, wisdom, and, patron, of, the, arts, these, two, legends, are, both, stories, of, mortals, challenging, gods, and, the, dreadful, consequences, one, scholar, points, out, that, the, legend, dealing, with, two, women, minerva, and, arachne, is, on, the, same, side, of, the, mirror, as, the, queen, s, reflection, while, the, male, legend, involving, the, god, apollo, and, the, satyr, marsyas, is, on, the, side, of, the, king, the, painted, surface, is, divided, into, quarters, horizontally, and, sevenths, vertically, this, grid, is, used, to, organise, the, elaborate, grouping, of, characters, and, was, a, common, device, at, the, time, vel, zquez, presents, nine, figures, eleven, if, the, king, and, queen, s, reflected, images, are, included, yet, they, occupy, only, the, lower, half, of, the, canvas, according, to, l, pez, rey, the, painting, has, three, focal, points, the, infanta, margaret, theresa, the, self, portrait, and, the, half, length, reflected, images, of, king, philip, iv, and, queen, mariana, in, 1960, clark, observed, that, the, success, of, the, composition, is, a, result, first, and, foremost, of, the, accurate, handling, of, light, and, shade, each, focal, point, involves, us, in, a, new, set, of, relations, and, to, paint, a, complex, group, like, the, meninas, the, painter, must, carry, in, his, head, a, single, consistent, scale, of, relations, which, he, can, apply, throughout, he, may, use, all, kinds, of, devices, to, help, him, do, this, perspective, is, one, of, them, but, ultimately, the, truth, about, a, complete, visual, impression, depends, on, one, thing, truth, of, tone, drawing, may, be, summary, colours, drab, but, if, the, relations, of, tone, are, true, the, picture, will, hold, however, the, focal, point, of, the, painting, is, widely, debated, leo, steinberg, argues, that, the, orthogonals, in, the, work, are, intentionally, disguised, so, that, the, picture, s, focal, center, shifts, similar, to, lopez, rey, he, describes, three, foci, the, man, in, the, doorway, however, is, the, vanishing, point, more, specifically, the, crook, of, his, arm, is, where, the, orthogonals, of, the, windows, and, lights, of, the, ceiling, meet, depth, and, dimension, are, rendered, by, the, use, of, linear, perspective, by, the, overlapping, of, the, layers, of, shapes, and, in, particular, as, stated, by, clark, through, the, use, of, tone, this, compositional, element, operates, within, the, picture, in, a, number, of, ways, first, there, is, the, appearance, of, natural, light, within, the, painted, room, and, beyond, it, the, pictorial, space, in, the, midground, and, foreground, is, lit, from, two, sources, by, thin, shafts, of, light, from, the, open, door, and, by, broad, streams, coming, through, the, window, to, the, right, the, 20th, century, french, philosopher, and, cultural, critic, michel, foucault, observed, that, the, light, from, the, window, illuminates, both, the, studio, foreground, and, the, unrepresented, area, in, front, of, it, in, which, the, king, the, queen, and, the, viewer, are, presumed, to, be, situated, for, jos, ortega, y, gasset, light, divides, the, scene, into, three, distinct, parts, with, foreground, and, background, planes, strongly, illuminated, between, which, a, darkened, intermediate, space, includes, silhouetted, figures, vel, zquez, uses, this, light, not, only, to, add, volume, and, definition, to, each, form, but, also, to, define, the, focal, points, of, the, painting, as, the, light, streams, in, from, the, right, it, brightly, glints, on, the, braid, and, golden, hair, of, the, female, dwarf, who, is, nearest, the, light, source, but, because, her, face, is, turned, from, the, light, and, in, shadow, its, tonality, does, not, make, it, a, point, of, particular, interest, similarly, the, light, glances, obliquely, on, the, cheek, of, the, lady, in, waiting, near, her, but, not, on, her, facial, features, much, of, her, lightly, coloured, dress, is, dimmed, by, shadow, the, infanta, however, stands, in, full, illumination, and, with, her, face, turned, towards, the, light, source, even, though, her, gaze, is, not, her, face, is, framed, by, the, pale, gossamer, of, her, hair, setting, her, apart, from, everything, else, in, the, picture, the, light, models, the, volumetric, geometry, of, her, form, defining, the, conic, nature, of, a, small, torso, bound, rigidly, into, a, corset, and, stiffened, bodice, and, the, panniered, skirt, extending, around, her, like, an, oval, candy, box, casting, its, own, deep, shadow, which, by, its, sharp, contrast, with, the, bright, brocade, both, emphasises, and, locates, the, small, figure, as, the, main, point, of, attention, vel, zquez, further, emphasises, the, infanta, by, his, positioning, and, lighting, of, her, maids, of, honour, who, are, set, opposite, one, another, before, and, behind, the, infanta, the, maid, on, the, viewer, s, left, is, given, a, brightly, lit, profile, while, her, sleeve, create, a, diagonal, her, opposite, figure, creates, a, broader, but, less, defined, reflection, of, her, attention, making, a, diagonal, space, between, them, in, which, their, charge, stands, protected, a, further, internal, diagonal, passes, through, the, space, occupied, by, the, infanta, there, is, a, similar, connection, between, the, female, dwarf, and, the, figure, of, vel, zquez, himself, both, of, whom, look, towards, the, viewer, from, similar, angles, creating, a, visual, tension, the, face, of, vel, zquez, is, dimly, lit, by, light, that, is, reflected, rather, than, direct, for, this, reason, his, features, though, not, as, sharply, defined, are, more, visible, than, those, of, the, dwarf, who, is, much, nearer, the, light, source, this, appearance, of, a, total, face, full, on, to, the, viewer, draws, the, attention, and, its, importance, is, marked, tonally, by, the, contrasting, frame, of, dark, hair, the, light, on, the, hand, and, brush, and, the, skilfully, placed, triangle, of, light, on, the, artist, s, sleeve, pointing, directly, to, the, face, the, mirror, is, a, perfectly, defined, unbroken, pale, rectangle, within, a, broad, black, rectangle, a, clear, geometric, shape, like, a, lit, face, draws, the, attention, of, the, viewer, more, than, a, broken, geometric, shape, such, as, the, door, or, a, shadowed, or, oblique, face, such, as, that, of, the, dwarf, in, the, foreground, or, that, of, the, man, in, the, background, the, viewer, cannot, distinguish, the, features, of, the, king, and, queen, but, in, the, opalescent, sheen, of, the, mirror, s, surface, the, glowing, ovals, are, plainly, turned, directly, to, the, viewer, jonathan, miller, pointed, out, that, apart, from, adding, suggestive, gleams, at, the, bevelled, edges, the, most, important, way, the, mirror, betrays, its, identity, is, by, disclosing, imagery, whose, brightness, is, so, inconsistent, with, the, dimness, of, the, surrounding, wall, that, it, can, only, have, been, borrowed, by, reflection, from, the, strongly, illuminated, figures, of, the, king, and, queen, as, the, maids, of, honour, are, reflected, in, each, other, so, too, do, the, king, and, queen, have, their, doubles, within, the, painting, in, the, dimly, lit, forms, of, the, chaperone, and, guard, the, two, who, serve, and, care, for, their, daughter, the, positioning, of, these, figures, sets, up, a, pattern, one, man, a, couple, one, man, a, couple, and, while, the, outer, figures, are, nearer, the, viewer, than, the, others, they, all, occupy, the, same, horizontal, band, on, the, picture, s, surface, adding, to, the, inner, complexities, of, the, picture, is, the, male, dwarf, in, the, foreground, whose, raised, hand, echoes, the, gesture, of, the, figure, in, the, background, while, his, playful, demeanour, and, distraction, from, the, central, action, are, in, complete, contrast, with, it, the, informality, of, his, pose, his, shadowed, profile, and, his, dark, hair, all, serve, to, make, him, a, mirror, image, to, the, kneeling, attendant, of, the, infanta, however, the, painter, has, set, him, forward, of, the, light, streaming, through, the, window, and, so, minimised, the, contrast, of, tone, on, this, foreground, figure, despite, certain, spatial, ambiguities, this, is, the, painter, s, most, thoroughly, rendered, architectural, space, and, the, only, one, in, which, a, ceiling, is, shown, according, to, l, pez, rey, in, no, other, composition, did, vel, zquez, so, dramatically, lead, the, eye, to, areas, beyond, the, viewer, s, sight, both, the, canvas, he, is, seen, painting, and, the, space, beyond, the, frame, where, the, king, and, queen, stand, can, only, be, imagined, the, bareness, of, the, dark, ceiling, the, back, of, vel, zquez, s, canvas, and, the, strict, geometry, of, framed, paintings, contrast, with, the, animated, brilliantly, lit, and, sumptuously, painted, foreground, entourage, stone, writes, we, cannot, take, in, all, the, figures, of, the, painting, in, one, glance, not, only, do, the, life, size, proportions, of, the, painting, preclude, such, an, appreciation, but, also, the, fact, that, the, heads, of, the, figures, are, turned, in, different, directions, means, that, our, gaze, is, deflected, the, painting, communicates, through, images, which, in, order, to, be, understood, must, thus, be, considered, in, sequence, one, after, the, other, in, the, context, of, a, history, that, is, still, unfolding, it, is, a, history, that, is, still, unframed, even, in, this, painting, composed, of, frames, within, frames, according, to, kahr, the, composition, could, have, been, influenced, by, the, traditional, dutch, gallery, pictures, such, as, those, by, frans, francken, the, younger, willem, van, haecht, or, david, teniers, the, younger, teniers, work, was, owned, by, philip, iv, and, would, have, been, known, by, vel, zquez, like, las, meninas, they, often, depict, formal, visits, by, important, collectors, or, rulers, a, common, occurrence, and, show, a, room, with, a, series, of, windows, dominating, one, side, wall, and, paintings, hung, between, the, windows, as, well, as, on, the, other, walls, gallery, portraits, were, also, used, to, glorify, the, artist, as, well, as, royalty, or, members, of, the, higher, classes, as, may, have, been, vel, zquez, s, intention, with, this, work, the, spatial, structure, and, positioning, of, the, mirror, s, reflection, are, such, that, philip, iv, and, mariana, appear, to, be, standing, on, the, viewer, s, side, of, the, pictorial, space, facing, the, infanta, and, her, entourage, according, to, janson, not, only, is, the, gathering, of, figures, in, the, foreground, for, philip, and, mariana, s, benefit, but, the, painter, s, attention, is, concentrated, on, the, couple, as, he, appears, to, be, working, on, their, portrait, although, they, can, only, be, seen, in, the, mirror, reflection, their, distant, image, occupies, a, central, position, in, the, canvas, in, terms, of, social, hierarchy, as, well, as, composition, as, spectators, the, viewer, s, position, in, relation, to, the, painting, is, uncertain, it, has, been, debated, whether, the, ruling, couple, are, standing, beside, the, viewer, or, have, replaced, the, viewer, who, sees, the, scene, through, their, eyes, lending, weight, to, the, latter, idea, are, the, gazes, of, three, of, the, figures, vel, zquez, the, infanta, and, maribarbola, who, appear, to, be, looking, directly, at, the, viewer, the, mirror, on, the, back, wall, indicates, what, is, not, there, the, king, and, queen, and, in, the, words, of, harriet, stone, the, generations, of, spectators, who, assume, the, couple, s, place, before, the, painting, writing, in, 1980, the, critics, snyder, and, cohn, observed, vel, zquez, wanted, the, mirror, to, depend, upon, the, useable, painted, canvas, for, its, image, why, should, he, want, that, the, luminous, image, in, the, mirror, appears, to, reflect, the, king, and, queen, themselves, but, it, does, more, than, just, this, the, mirror, outdoes, nature, the, mirror, image, is, only, a, reflection, a, reflection, of, what, of, the, real, thing, of, the, art, of, vel, zquez, in, the, presence, of, his, divinely, ordained, monarchs, vel, zquez, exults, in, his, artistry, and, counsels, philip, and, maria, not, to, look, for, the, revelation, of, their, image, in, the, natural, reflection, of, a, looking, glass, but, rather, in, the, penetrating, vision, of, their, master, painter, in, the, presence, of, vel, zquez, a, mirror, image, is, a, poor, imitation, of, the, real, in, las, meninas, the, king, and, queen, are, supposedly, outside, the, painting, yet, their, reflection, in, the, back, wall, mirror, also, places, them, inside, the, pictorial, space, snyder, proposes, it, is, a, mirror, of, majesty, or, an, allusion, to, the, mirror, for, princes, while, it, is, a, literal, reflection, of, the, king, and, queen, snyder, writes, it, is, the, image, of, exemplary, monarchs, a, reflection, of, ideal, character, later, he, focuses, his, attention, on, the, princess, writing, that, vel, zquez, s, portrait, is, the, painted, equivalent, of, a, manual, for, the, education, of, the, princess, a, mirror, of, the, princess, the, painting, is, likely, to, have, been, influenced, by, jan, van, eyck, s, arnolfini, portrait, of, 1434, at, the, time, van, eyck, s, painting, hung, in, philip, s, palace, and, would, have, been, familiar, to, vel, zquez, the, arnolfini, portrait, also, has, a, mirror, positioned, at, the, back, of, the, pictorial, space, reflecting, two, figures, who, would, have, the, same, angle, of, vision, as, does, the, viewer, of, vel, zquez, s, painting, they, are, too, small, to, identify, but, it, has, been, speculated, that, one, may, be, intended, as, the, artist, himself, though, he, is, not, shown, in, the, act, of, painting, according, to, lucien, d, llenbach, the, mirror, faces, the, observer, as, in, van, eyck, s, painting, but, here, the, procedure, is, more, realistic, to, the, degree, that, the, rearview, mirror, in, which, the, royal, couple, appears, is, no, longer, convex, but, flat, whereas, the, reflection, in, the, flemish, painting, recomposed, objects, and, characters, within, a, space, that, is, condensed, and, deformed, by, the, curve, of, the, mirror, that, of, vel, zquez, refuses, to, play, with, the, laws, of, perspective, it, projects, onto, the, canvas, the, perfect, double, of, the, king, and, queen, positioned, in, front, of, the, painting, jonathan, miller, asks, what, are, we, to, make, of, the, blurred, features, of, the, royal, couple, it, is, unlikely, that, it, has, anything, to, do, with, the, optical, imperfection, of, the, mirror, which, would, in, reality, have, displayed, a, focused, image, of, the, king, and, queen, he, notes, that, in, addition, to, the, represented, mirror, he, teasingly, implies, an, unrepresented, one, without, which, it, is, difficult, to, imagine, how, he, could, have, shown, himself, painting, the, picture, we, now, see, the, elusiveness, of, las, meninas, according, to, dawson, carr, suggests, that, art, and, life, are, an, illusion, the, relationship, between, illusion, and, reality, were, central, concerns, in, spanish, culture, during, the, 17th, century, figuring, largely, in, don, quixote, the, best, known, work, of, spanish, baroque, literature, in, this, respect, calder, n, de, la, barca, s, play, life, is, a, dream, is, commonly, seen, as, the, literary, equivalent, of, vel, zquez, s, painting, what, is, a, life, a, frenzy, what, is, life, a, shadow, an, illusion, and, a, sham, the, greatest, good, is, small, all, life, it, seems, is, just, a, dream, and, even, dreams, are, dreams, jon, manchip, white, notes, that, the, painting, can, be, seen, as, a, r, sum, of, the, whole, of, vel, zquez, s, life, and, career, as, well, as, a, summary, of, his, art, to, that, point, he, placed, his, only, confirmed, self, portrait, in, a, room, in, the, royal, palace, surrounded, by, an, assembly, of, royalty, courtiers, and, fine, objects, that, represent, his, life, at, court, the, art, historian, svetlana, alpers, suggests, that, by, portraying, the, artist, at, work, in, the, company, of, royalty, and, nobility, vel, zquez, was, claiming, high, status, for, both, the, artist, and, his, art, and, in, particular, to, propose, that, painting, is, a, liberal, rather, than, a, mechanical, art, this, distinction, was, a, point, of, controversy, at, the, time, it, would, have, been, significant, to, vel, zquez, since, the, rules, of, the, order, of, santiago, excluded, those, whose, occupations, were, mechanical, kahr, asserts, that, this, was, the, best, way, for, vel, zquez, to, show, that, he, was, neither, a, craftsman, or, a, tradesman, but, an, official, of, the, court, furthermore, this, was, a, way, to, prove, himself, worthy, of, acceptance, by, the, royal, family, michel, foucault, devoted, the, opening, chapter, of, the, order, of, things, 1966, to, an, analysis, of, las, meninas, foucault, describes, the, painting, in, meticulous, detail, but, in, a, language, that, is, neither, prescribed, by, nor, filtered, through, the, various, texts, of, art, historical, investigation, foucault, viewed, the, painting, without, regard, to, the, subject, matter, nor, to, the, artist, s, biography, technical, ability, sources, and, influences, social, context, or, relationship, with, his, patrons, instead, he, analyzes, its, conscious, artifice, highlighting, the, complex, network, of, visual, relationships, between, painter, subject, model, and, viewer, we, are, looking, at, a, picture, in, which, the, painter, is, in, turn, looking, out, at, us, a, mere, confrontation, eyes, catching, one, another, s, glance, direct, looks, superimposing, themselves, upon, one, another, as, they, cross, and, yet, this, slender, line, of, reciprocal, visibility, embraces, a, whole, complex, network, of, uncertainties, exchanges, and, feints, the, painter, is, turning, his, eyes, towards, us, only, in, so, far, as, we, happen, to, occupy, the, same, position, as, his, subject, for, foucault, las, meninas, illustrates, the, first, signs, of, a, new, episteme, or, way, of, thinking, it, represents, a, midpoint, between, what, he, sees, as, the, two, great, discontinuities, in, european, thought, the, classical, and, the, modern, perhaps, there, exists, in, this, painting, by, vel, zquez, the, representation, as, it, were, of, classical, representation, and, the, definition, of, the, space, it, opens, up, to, us, representation, freed, finally, from, the, relation, that, was, impeding, it, can, offer, itself, as, representation, in, its, pure, form, now, he, the, painter, can, be, seen, caught, in, a, moment, of, stillness, at, the, neutral, centre, of, his, oscillation, his, dark, torso, and, bright, face, are, half, way, between, the, visible, and, the, invisible, emerging, from, the, canvas, beyond, our, view, he, moves, into, our, gaze, but, when, in, a, moment, he, makes, a, step, to, the, right, removing, himself, from, our, gaze, he, will, be, standing, exactly, in, front, of, the, canvas, he, is, painting, he, will, enter, that, region, where, his, painting, neglected, for, an, instant, will, for, him, become, visible, once, more, free, of, shadow, and, free, of, reticence, as, though, the, painter, could, not, at, the, same, time, be, seen, on, the, picture, where, he, is, represented, and, also, see, that, upon, which, he, is, representing, something, in, his, 2015, analysis, xavier, d, h, rouville, brings, the, painting, closer, to, its, first, name, namely, the, family, of, philippe, iv, which, at, the, time, earned, it, the, term, theology, of, painting, by, luca, giordano, contemporary, painter, of, vel, zquez, through, this, representation, the, painter, would, have, conceptualized, the, divine, view, of, his, creation, when, the, spectator, places, himself, in, front, of, the, canvas, in, place, of, the, king, s, study, for, which, this, painting, was, very, exclusively, intended, he, finds, himself, instantly, invested, with, the, divine, power, that, of, seeing, without, being, seen, the, family, of, philip, iv, the, interface, that, constitutes, this, canvas, must, therefore, be, considered, as, a, one, way, mirror, in, which, each, of, the, protagonists, of, this, representation, looks, at, themselves, and, behind, which, the, monarch, invests, divine, power, and, his, wife, can, at, leisure, and, in, complete, discretion, to, contemplate, their, life, s, work, their, family, in, the, broadest, sense, of, the, term, further, still, this, canvas, can, be, seen, not, only, as, a, summary, of, the, state, of, advancement, of, his, art, at, the, time, of, painting, but, also, as, a, curriculum, vit, of, vel, zquez, s, life, and, career, the, latter, having, gone, so, far, as, to, represent, himself, in, this, fresco, at, three, key, periods, of, his, own, existence, within, the, court, of, spain, in, the, background, and, to, the, left, as, the, king, s, painter, then, to, the, right, this, time, at, the, very, heart, of, the, family, of, philip, iv, alongside, the, governess, as, valet, of, the, king, s, bedroom, and, finally, at, the, back, and, in, the, center, camped, on, the, stairs, as, aposentador, or, marshal, of, the, palace, the, supreme, function, he, exercised, as, the, king, s, best, friend, and, confidant, many, aspects, of, las, meninas, relate, to, earlier, works, by, vel, zquez, in, which, he, plays, with, conventions, of, representation, in, the, rokeby, venus, his, only, surviving, nude, the, face, of, the, subject, is, visible, blurred, beyond, any, realism, in, a, mirror, the, angle, of, the, mirror, is, such, that, although, often, described, as, looking, at, herself, is, more, disconcertingly, looking, at, us, in, the, early, christ, in, the, house, of, martha, and, mary, of, 1618, christ, and, his, companions, are, seen, only, through, a, serving, hatch, to, a, room, behind, according, to, the, national, gallery, london, who, are, clear, that, this, is, the, intention, although, before, restoration, many, art, historians, regarded, this, scene, as, either, a, painting, hanging, on, the, wall, in, the, main, scene, or, a, reflection, in, a, mirror, and, the, debate, has, continued, the, dress, worn, in, the, two, scenes, also, differs, the, main, scene, is, in, contemporary, dress, while, the, scene, with, christ, uses, conventional, iconographic, biblical, dress, in, las, hilanderas, believed, to, have, been, painted, the, year, after, las, meninas, two, different, scenes, from, ovid, are, shown, one, in, contemporary, dress, in, the, foreground, and, the, other, partly, in, antique, dress, played, before, a, tapestry, on, the, back, wall, of, a, room, behind, the, first, according, to, the, critic, sira, dambe, aspects, of, representation, and, power, are, addressed, in, this, painting, in, ways, closely, connected, with, their, treatment, in, las, meninas, in, a, series, of, portraits, of, the, late, 1630s, and, 1640s, all, now, in, the, prado, vel, zquez, painted, clowns, and, other, members, of, the, royal, household, posing, as, gods, heroes, and, philosophers, the, intention, is, certainly, partly, comic, at, least, for, those, in, the, know, but, in, a, highly, ambiguous, way, vel, zquez, s, portraits, of, the, royal, family, themselves, had, until, then, been, straightforward, if, often, unflatteringly, direct, and, highly, complex, in, expression, on, the, other, hand, his, royal, portraits, designed, to, be, seen, across, vast, palace, rooms, feature, more, strongly, than, his, other, works, the, bravura, handling, for, which, he, is, famous, vel, zquez, s, handling, of, paint, is, exceptionally, free, and, as, one, approaches, las, meninas, there, is, a, point, at, which, the, figures, suddenly, dissolve, into, smears, and, blobs, of, paint, the, long, handled, brushes, he, used, enabled, him, to, stand, back, and, judge, the, total, effect, in, 1692, the, neapolitan, painter, luca, giordano, became, one, of, the, few, allowed, to, view, paintings, held, in, philip, iv, s, private, apartments, and, was, greatly, impressed, by, las, meninas, giordano, described, the, work, as, the, theology, of, painting, and, was, inspired, to, paint, a, homage, to, vel, zquez, national, gallery, london, by, the, early, 18th, century, his, oeuvre, was, gaining, international, recognition, and, later, in, the, century, british, collectors, ventured, to, spain, in, search, of, acquisitions, since, the, popularity, of, italian, art, was, then, at, its, height, among, british, connoisseurs, they, concentrated, on, paintings, that, showed, obvious, italian, influence, largely, ignoring, others, such, as, las, meninas, an, almost, immediate, influence, can, be, seen, in, the, two, portraits, by, juan, bautista, mart, nez, del, mazo, of, subjects, depicted, in, las, meninas, which, in, some, ways, reverse, the, motif, of, that, painting, ten, years, later, in, 1666, mazo, painted, infanta, margaret, theresa, who, was, then, 15, and, just, about, to, leave, madrid, to, marry, the, holy, roman, emperor, in, the, background, are, figures, in, two, further, receding, doorways, one, of, which, was, the, new, king, charles, margaret, theresa, s, brother, and, another, the, dwarf, maribarbola, a, mazo, portrait, of, the, widowed, queen, mariana, again, shows, through, a, doorway, in, the, alc, zar, the, young, king, with, dwarfs, possibly, including, maribarbola, and, attendants, who, offer, him, a, drink, mazo, s, painting, of, the, family, of, the, artist, also, shows, a, composition, similar, to, that, of, las, meninas, francisco, goya, etched, a, print, of, las, meninas, in, 1778, and, used, vel, zquez, s, painting, as, the, model, for, his, charles, iv, of, spain, and, his, family, as, in, las, meninas, the, royal, family, in, goya, s, work, is, apparently, visiting, the, artist, s, studio, in, both, paintings, the, artist, is, shown, working, on, a, canvas, of, which, only, the, rear, is, visible, goya, however, replaces, the, atmospheric, and, warm, perspective, of, las, meninas, with, what, pierre, gassier, calls, a, sense, of, imminent, suffocation, goya, s, royal, family, is, presented, on, a, stage, facing, the, public, while, in, the, shadow, of, the, wings, the, painter, with, a, grim, smile, points, and, says, look, at, them, and, judge, for, yourself, the, 19th, century, british, art, collector, william, john, bankes, travelled, to, spain, during, the, peninsular, war, 1808, 1814, and, acquired, a, copy, of, las, meninas, painted, by, mazo, which, he, believed, to, be, an, original, preparatory, oil, sketch, by, vel, zquez, although, vel, zquez, did, not, usually, paint, studies, bankes, described, his, purchase, as, the, glory, of, my, collection, noting, that, he, had, been, a, long, while, in, treaty, for, it, and, was, obliged, to, pay, a, high, price, a, new, appreciation, for, vel, zquez, s, less, italianate, paintings, developed, after, 1819, when, ferdinand, vii, opened, the, royal, collection, to, the, public, in, 1879, john, singer, sargent, painted, a, small, scale, copy, of, las, meninas, while, his, 1882, painting, the, daughters, of, edward, darley, boit, is, a, homage, to, vel, zquez, s, panel, the, irish, artist, sir, john, lavery, chose, vel, zquez, s, masterpiece, as, the, basis, for, his, portrait, the, royal, family, at, buckingham, palace, 1913, george, v, visited, lavery, s, studio, during, the, execution, of, the, painting, and, perhaps, remembering, the, legend, that, philip, iv, had, daubed, the, cross, of, the, knights, of, santiago, on, the, figure, of, vel, zquez, asked, lavery, if, he, could, contribute, to, the, portrait, with, his, own, hand, according, to, lavery, thinking, that, royal, blue, might, be, an, appropriate, colour, i, mixed, it, on, the, palette, and, taking, a, brush, he, applied, it, to, the, garter, ribbon, between, august, and, december, 1957, pablo, picasso, painted, a, series, of, 58, interpretations, of, las, meninas, and, figures, from, it, which, currently, fill, the, las, meninas, room, of, the, museu, picasso, in, barcelona, spain, picasso, did, not, vary, the, characters, within, the, series, but, largely, retained, the, naturalness, of, the, scene, according, to, the, museum, his, works, constitute, an, exhaustive, study, of, form, rhythm, colour, and, movement, a, print, of, 1973, by, richard, hamilton, called, picasso, s, meninas, draws, on, both, vel, zquez, and, picasso, photographer, joel, peter, witkin, was, commissioned, by, the, spanish, ministry, of, culture, to, create, a, work, titled, las, meninas, new, mexico, 1987, which, references, vel, zquez, s, painting, as, well, as, other, works, by, spanish, artists, in, 2004,
