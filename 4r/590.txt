digital, art, refers, to, any, artistic, work, or, practice, that, uses, digital, technology, as, part, of, the, creative, or, presentation, process, it, can, also, refer, to, computational, art, that, uses, and, engages, with, digital, media, since, the, 1960s, various, names, have, been, used, to, describe, digital, art, including, computer, art, electronic, art, multimedia, art, and, new, media, art, subcategories, for, the, art, include, digital, painting, where, artists, use, software, to, emulate, techniques, using, in, physical, painting, digital, illustration, which, involves, creating, rendered, images, for, other, media, and, 3d, modeling, where, artists, craft, three, dimensional, objects, and, scenes, pieces, of, digital, art, range, from, captured, in, unique, displays, and, restricted, from, duplication, to, popular, memes, available, for, reproduction, in, commercial, products, repositories, for, digital, art, include, pieces, stored, on, physical, media, galleries, on, display, on, websites, and, collections, for, download, for, free, or, purchase, in, the, early, 1960s, john, whitney, developed, the, first, computer, generated, art, using, mathematical, operations, in, 1963, ivan, sutherland, invented, the, first, user, interactive, computer, graphics, interface, known, as, sketchpad, between, 1974, and, 1977, salvador, dal, created, two, big, canvases, of, gala, contemplating, the, mediterranean, sea, which, at, a, distance, of, 20, meters, is, transformed, into, the, portrait, of, abraham, lincoln, homage, to, rothko, and, prints, of, lincoln, in, dalivision, based, on, a, portrait, of, abraham, lincoln, processed, on, a, computer, by, leon, harmon, published, in, the, recognition, of, faces, the, technique, is, similar, to, what, later, became, known, as, photographic, mosaics, andy, warhol, created, digital, art, using, an, amiga, where, the, computer, was, publicly, introduced, at, the, lincoln, center, new, york, in, july, 1985, an, image, of, debbie, harry, was, captured, in, monochrome, from, a, video, camera, and, digitized, into, a, graphics, program, called, propaint, warhol, manipulated, the, image, by, adding, color, using, flood, fills, digital, art, can, be, purely, computer, generated, such, as, fractals, and, algorithmic, art, or, taken, from, other, sources, such, as, a, scanned, photograph, or, an, image, drawn, using, vector, graphics, software, using, a, mouse, or, graphics, tablet, artworks, are, considered, digital, paintings, when, created, similarly, to, non, digital, paintings, but, using, software, on, a, computer, platform, and, digitally, outputting, the, resulting, image, as, painted, on, canvas, despite, differing, viewpoints, on, digital, technology, s, impact, on, the, arts, a, consensus, exists, within, the, digital, art, community, about, its, significant, contribution, to, expanding, the, creative, domain, i, e, that, it, has, greatly, broadened, the, creative, opportunities, available, to, professional, and, non, professional, artists, alike, digital, visual, art, consists, of, either, 2d, visual, information, displayed, on, an, electronic, visual, display, or, information, mathematically, translated, into, 3d, information, viewed, through, perspective, projection, on, an, electronic, visual, display, the, simplest, form, 2d, computer, graphics, reflects, how, one, might, draw, with, a, pencil, or, paper, in, this, case, however, the, image, is, on, the, computer, screen, and, the, instrument, you, draw, with, might, be, a, tablet, stylus, or, a, mouse, what, is, generated, on, your, screen, might, appear, to, be, drawn, with, a, pencil, pen, or, paintbrush, the, second, kind, is, 3d, computer, graphics, where, the, screen, becomes, a, window, into, a, virtual, environment, where, you, arrange, objects, to, be, photographed, by, the, computer, typically, 2d, computer, graphics, use, raster, graphics, as, their, primary, means, of, source, data, representations, whereas, 3d, computer, graphics, use, vector, graphics, in, the, creation, of, immersive, virtual, reality, installations, a, possible, third, paradigm, is, to, generate, art, in, 2d, or, 3d, entirely, through, the, execution, of, algorithms, coded, into, computer, programs, this, can, be, considered, the, native, art, form, of, the, computer, and, an, introduction, to, the, history, of, which, is, available, in, an, interview, with, computer, art, pioneer, frieder, nake, fractal, art, datamoshing, algorithmic, art, and, real, time, generative, art, are, examples, 3d, graphics, are, created, via, the, process, of, designing, imagery, from, geometric, shapes, polygons, or, nurbs, curves, to, create, three, dimensional, objects, and, scenes, for, use, in, various, media, such, as, film, television, print, rapid, prototyping, games, simulations, and, special, visual, effects, there, are, many, software, programs, for, doing, this, the, technology, can, enable, collaboration, lending, itself, to, sharing, and, augmenting, by, a, creative, effort, similar, to, the, open, source, movement, and, the, creative, commons, in, which, users, can, collaborate, on, a, project, to, create, art, pop, surrealist, artist, ray, caesar, works, in, maya, a, 3d, modeling, software, used, for, digital, animation, using, it, to, create, his, figures, as, well, as, the, virtual, realms, in, which, they, exist, computer, generated, animations, are, animations, created, with, a, computer, from, digital, models, created, by, 3d, artists, or, procedurally, generated, the, term, is, usually, applied, to, works, created, entirely, with, a, computer, movies, make, heavy, use, of, computer, generated, graphics, they, are, called, computer, generated, imagery, cgi, in, the, film, industry, in, the, 1990s, and, early, 2000s, cgi, advanced, enough, that, for, the, first, time, it, was, possible, to, create, realistic, 3d, computer, animation, although, films, had, been, using, extensive, computer, images, since, the, mid, 70s, a, number, of, modern, films, have, been, noted, for, their, heavy, use, of, photo, realistic, cgi, digital, painting, mainly, refers, to, the, process, of, creating, paintings, on, computer, software, based, on, computers, or, graphic, tables, through, pixel, simulation, digital, brushes, in, digital, software, see, the, software, in, digital, painting, can, imitate, traditional, painting, paints, and, tools, such, as, oil, acrylic, acid, pastel, charcoal, and, airbrush, users, of, the, software, can, also, customize, the, pixel, size, to, achieve, a, unique, visual, effect, customized, brushes, artists, have, used, artificial, intelligence, to, create, artwork, since, at, least, the, 1960s, since, their, design, in, 2014, some, artists, have, created, artwork, using, a, generative, adversarial, network, gan, which, is, a, machine, learning, framework, that, allows, two, algorithms, to, compete, with, each, other, and, iterate, it, can, be, used, to, generate, pictures, that, have, visual, effects, similar, to, traditional, fine, art, the, essential, idea, of, image, generators, is, that, people, can, use, text, descriptions, to, let, ai, convert, their, text, into, visual, picture, content, anyone, can, turn, their, language, into, a, painting, through, a, picture, generator, and, some, artists, can, use, image, generators, to, generate, their, paintings, instead, of, drawing, from, scratch, and, then, they, use, the, generated, paintings, as, a, basis, to, improve, them, and, finally, create, new, digital, paintings, this, greatly, reduces, the, threshold, of, painting, and, challenges, the, traditional, definition, of, painting, art, generally, the, user, can, set, the, input, and, the, input, content, includes, detailed, picture, content, that, the, user, wants, for, example, the, content, can, be, a, scene, s, content, characters, weather, character, relationships, specific, items, etc, it, can, also, include, selecting, a, specific, artist, style, screen, style, image, pixel, size, brightness, etc, then, picture, generators, will, return, several, similar, pictures, generated, according, to, the, input, generally, 4, pictures, are, given, now, after, receiving, the, results, generated, by, picture, generators, the, user, can, select, one, picture, as, a, result, he, wants, or, let, the, generator, redraw, and, return, to, new, pictures, in, both, 1991, and, 1992, karl, sims, won, the, golden, nica, award, at, prix, ars, electronica, for, his, 3d, ai, animated, videos, using, artificial, evolution, in, 2009, eric, millikin, won, the, pulitzer, prize, along, with, several, other, awards, for, his, artificial, intelligence, art, that, was, critical, of, government, corruption, in, detroit, and, resulted, in, the, city, s, mayor, being, sent, to, jail, in, 2018, christie, s, auction, house, in, new, york, sold, an, artificial, intelligence, work, edmond, de, bellamy, for, us, 432, 500, it, was, created, by, a, collective, in, paris, named, obvious, in, 2019, stephanie, dinkins, won, the, creative, capital, award, for, her, creation, of, an, evolving, artificial, intelligence, based, on, the, interests, and, culture, s, of, people, of, color, in, 2022, an, amateur, artist, using, midjourney, won, the, first, place, 300, prize, in, a, digital, art, competition, at, the, colorado, state, fair, also, in, 2022, refik, anadol, created, an, artificial, intelligence, art, installation, at, the, museum, of, modern, art, in, new, york, based, on, the, museum, s, own, collection, repositories, for, 2d, and, vector, digital, art, offer, pieces, for, download, either, individually, or, in, bulk, proprietary, repositories, require, a, purchase, to, license, or, use, any, image, while, those, operating, under, freemium, models, like, flaticon, vecteezy, etc, provide, some, images, for, free, and, others, for, fee, based, on, tiers, in, contemporary, art, the, term, digital, art, is, used, primarily, to, describe, visual, art, that, is, made, with, digital, tools, and, also, is, highly, computational, and, explicitly, engages, with, digital, technologies, art, historian, christiane, paul, writes, that, it, is, highly, problematic, to, classify, all, art, that, makes, use, of, digital, technologies, somewhere, in, its, production, and, dissemination, process, as, digital, art, since, it, makes, it, almost, impossible, to, arrive, at, any, unifying, statement, about, the, art, form, computer, demos, are, computer, programs, usually, non, interactive, that, produce, audiovisual, presentations, they, are, a, novel, form, of, art, which, emerged, as, a, consequence, of, home, computer, revolution, in, the, early, 1980s, in, the, classification, of, digital, art, they, can, be, best, described, as, real, time, procedurally, generated, animated, audio, visuals, this, form, of, art, does, not, concentrate, only, on, aesthetics, of, the, final, presentation, but, also, on, complexities, and, skills, involved, in, creating, the, presentation, as, such, it, can, be, fully, enjoyed, only, by, persons, with, a, high, level, of, knowledge, in, the, filed, of, accompanying, computer, technologies, on, the, other, hand, many, of, the, created, pieces, of, art, are, primarily, aesthetic, or, amusing, and, those, can, be, enjoyed, by, general, public, digital, installation, art, constitutes, a, broad, field, of, activity, and, incorporates, many, forms, some, resemble, video, installations, particularly, large, scale, works, involving, projections, and, live, video, capture, by, using, projection, techniques, that, enhance, an, audience, s, impression, of, sensory, envelopment, many, digital, installations, attempt, to, create, immersive, environments, others, go, even, further, and, attempt, to, facilitate, a, complete, immersion, in, virtual, realms, this, type, of, installation, is, generally, site, specific, scalable, and, without, fixed, dimensionality, meaning, it, can, be, reconfigured, to, accommodate, different, presentation, spaces, noah, wardrip, fruin, s, screen, 2003, is, an, example, of, interactive, digital, installation, art, which, makes, use, of, a, cave, automatic, virtual, environment, to, create, an, interactive, experience, scott, snibbe, s, boundary, functions, is, an, example, of, augmented, reality, digital, installation, art, which, response, to, people, who, enter, the, installation, by, drawing, lines, between, people, indicating, their, personal, space, internet, art, is, digital, art, that, uses, the, specific, characteristics, of, the, internet, and, is, exhibited, on, the, internet, blockchain, and, more, specifically, nfts, are, associated, with, digital, art, since, the, nfts, craze, of, 2020, and, 2021, digital, art, is, a, common, use, case, for, nfts, by, minting, a, piece, of, digital, art, the, owner, of, the, nft, is, proven, to, be, the, owner, of, the, art, piece, while, the, technology, received, many, critics, and, has, many, flaws, related, to, plagiarism, and, fraud, due, to, its, almost, completely, unregulated, nature, auction, houses, museums, and, galleries, around, the, world, started, collaborations, and, partnerships, with, digital, artists, selling, nfts, associated, with, digital, artworks, via, nft, platforms, and, showcasing, those, artworks, associated, to, the, respective, nfts, both, in, virtual, galleries, and, real, life, screens, monitors, and, tvs, in, march, 2024, sotheby, s, presented, an, auction, highlighting, significant, contributions, of, digital, artists, over, the, previous, decade, one, of, many, record, breaking, auctions, of, digital, artwork, by, the, auction, house, these, auctions, look, broadly, at, the, cultural, impact, of, digital, art, in, the, 21, st, century, and, featured, work, by, artists, such, as, jennifer, kevin, mccoy, vera, moln, r, claudia, hart, jonathan, monaghan, and, sarah, zucker, notable, art, theorists, and, historians, in, this, field, include, oliver, grau, jon, ippolito, christiane, paul, frank, popper, jasia, reichardt, mario, costa, christine, buci, glucksmann, dominique, moulon, robert, c, morgan, roy, ascott, catherine, perret, margot, lovejoy, edmond, couchot, tina, rivers, ryan, fred, forest, and, edward, a, shanken, in, addition, to, the, creation, of, original, art, research, methods, that, utilize, ai, have, been, generated, to, quantitatively, analyze, digital, art, collections, this, has, been, made, possible, due, to, the, large, scale, digitization, of, artwork, in, the, past, few, decades, although, the, main, goal, of, digitization, was, to, allow, for, accessibility, and, exploration, of, these, collections, the, use, of, ai, in, analyzing, them, has, brought, about, new, research, perspectives, two, computational, methods, close, reading, and, distant, viewing, are, the, typical, approaches, used, to, analyze, digitized, art, close, reading, focuses, on, specific, visual, aspects, of, one, piece, some, tasks, performed, by, machines, in, close, reading, methods, include, computational, artist, authentication, and, analysis, of, brushstrokes, or, texture, properties, in, contrast, through, distant, viewing, methods, the, similarity, across, an, entire, collection, for, a, specific, feature, can, be, statistically, visualized, common, tasks, relating, to, this, method, include, automatic, classification, object, detection, multimodal, tasks, knowledge, discovery, in, art, history, and, computational, aesthetics, whereas, distant, viewing, includes, the, analysis, of, large, collections, close, reading, involves, one, piece, of, artwork, whilst, 2d, and, 3d, digital, art, is, beneficial, as, it, allows, the, preservation, of, history, that, would, otherwise, have, been, destroyed, by, events, like, natural, disasters, and, war, there, is, the, issue, of, who, should, own, these, 3d, scans, i, e, who, should, own, the, digital, copyrights
