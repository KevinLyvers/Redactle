samba, portuguese, pronunciation, is, a, name, or, prefix, used, for, several, rhythmic, variants, such, as, samba, urbano, carioca, urban, carioca, samba, samba, de, roda, sometimes, also, called, rural, samba, amongst, many, other, forms, of, samba, mostly, originated, in, the, rio, de, janeiro, and, bahia, states, samba, is, a, broad, term, for, many, of, the, rhythms, that, compose, the, better, known, brazilian, music, genres, that, originated, in, the, afro, brazilian, communities, of, bahia, in, the, late, 19th, century, and, early, 20th, century, having, continued, its, development, on, the, communities, of, rio, de, janeiro, in, the, early, 20th, century, having, its, roots, in, the, afro, brazilian, candombl, as, well, as, other, afro, brazilian, and, indigenous, folk, traditions, such, as, the, traditional, samba, de, caboclo, it, is, considered, one, of, the, most, important, cultural, phenomena, in, brazil, and, one, of, the, country, s, symbols, present, in, the, portuguese, language, at, least, since, the, 19th, century, the, word, samba, was, originally, used, to, designate, a, popular, dance, over, time, its, meaning, has, been, extended, to, a, batuque, like, circle, dance, a, dance, style, and, also, to, a, music, genre, this, process, of, establishing, itself, as, a, musical, genre, began, in, the, 1910s, and, it, had, its, inaugural, landmark, in, the, song, pelo, telefone, launched, in, 1917, despite, being, identified, by, its, creators, the, public, and, the, brazilian, music, industry, as, samba, this, pioneering, style, was, much, more, connected, from, the, rhythmic, and, instrumental, point, of, view, to, maxixe, than, to, samba, itself, samba, was, modernly, structured, as, a, musical, genre, only, in, the, late, 1920s, from, the, neighborhood, of, est, cio, and, soon, extended, to, oswaldo, cruz, and, other, parts, of, rio, through, its, commuter, rail, today, synonymous, with, the, rhythm, of, samba, this, new, samba, brought, innovations, in, rhythm, melody, and, also, in, thematic, aspects, its, rhythmic, change, based, on, a, new, percussive, instrumental, pattern, resulted, in, a, more, batucado, and, syncopated, style, as, opposed, to, the, inaugural, samba, maxixe, notably, characterized, by, a, faster, tempo, longer, notes, and, a, characterized, cadence, far, beyond, the, simple, ones, palms, used, so, far, also, the, est, cio, paradigm, innovated, in, the, formatting, of, samba, as, a, song, with, its, musical, organization, in, first, and, second, parts, in, both, melody, and, lyrics, in, this, way, the, sambistas, of, est, cio, created, structured, and, redefined, the, urban, carioca, samba, as, a, genre, in, a, modern, and, finished, way, in, this, process, of, establishment, as, an, urban, and, modern, musical, expression, the, carioca, samba, had, the, decisive, role, of, samba, schools, responsible, for, defining, and, legitimizing, definitively, the, aesthetic, bases, of, rhythm, and, radio, broadcasting, which, greatly, contributed, to, the, diffusion, and, popularization, of, the, genre, and, its, song, singers, thus, samba, has, achieved, major, projection, throughout, brazil, and, has, become, one, of, the, main, symbols, of, brazilian, national, identity, once, criminalized, and, rejected, for, its, afro, brazilian, origins, and, definitely, working, class, music, in, its, mythic, origins, the, genre, has, also, received, support, from, members, of, the, upper, classes, and, the, country, s, cultural, elite, at, the, same, time, that, it, established, itself, as, the, genesis, of, samba, the, est, cio, paradigm, paved, the, way, for, its, fragmentation, into, new, sub, genres, and, styles, of, composition, and, interpretation, throughout, the, 20th, century, mainly, from, the, so, called, golden, age, of, brazilian, music, samba, received, abundant, categorizations, some, of, which, denote, solid, and, well, accepted, derivative, strands, such, as, bossa, nova, pagode, partido, alto, samba, de, breque, samba, can, o, samba, de, enredo, and, samba, de, terreiro, while, other, nomenclatures, were, somewhat, more, imprecise, such, as, samba, do, barulho, literally, noise, samba, samba, epistolar, epistolary, samba, ou, samba, fon, tico, phonetic, samba, and, some, merely, derogatory, such, as, sambalada, sambolero, or, samb, o, joia, the, modern, samba, that, emerged, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, is, predominantly, in, a, 2, 4, time, signature, varied, with, the, conscious, use, of, a, sung, chorus, to, a, batucada, rhythm, with, various, stanzas, of, declaratory, verses, its, traditional, instrumentation, is, composed, of, percussion, instruments, such, as, the, pandeiro, cu, ca, tamborim, ganz, and, surdo, accompaniment, whose, inspiration, is, choro, such, as, classical, guitar, and, cavaquinho, in, 2005, unesco, declared, samba, de, roda, part, of, intangible, cultural, heritage, of, humanity, and, in, 2007, the, brazilian, national, institute, of, historic, and, artistic, heritage, declared, carioca, samba, and, three, of, its, matrixes, samba, de, terreiro, partido, alto, and, samba, de, enredo, as, cultural, heritage, in, brazil, also, in, 2018, the, prefecture, of, salvador, proclaimed, samba, junino, also, known, as, samba, duro, an, urban, variation, of, samba, to, be, part, of, its, cultural, heritage, there, is, no, consensus, among, experts, on, the, etymology, of, the, term, samba, a, traditionalist, view, defends, that, the, etymon, comes, from, the, bantu, was, in, the, di, rio, de, pernambuco, in, 1830, the, term, was, documented, in, the, publication, in, a, note, opposing, the, sending, of, soldiers, to, the, c, ountryside, of, pernambuco, state, as, a, disciplinary, measure, as, there, they, could, be, idle, and, entertained, with, fishing, of, corrals, and, climbing, coconut, trees, in, whose, hobbies, viola, and, samba, will, be, welcomed, another, old, appearance, was, recorded, in, the, humorous, recife, newspaper, o, carapuceiro, dated, february, 1838, when, father, miguel, lopes, gama, of, sacramento, wrote, against, what, he, called, the, samba, d, almocreve, not, referring, to, the, future, musical, genre, but, a, kind, of, merriment, dance, drama, popular, for, black, people, of, that, time, according, to, hiram, ara, jo, da, costa, over, the, centuries, the, festival, of, dances, of, enslaved, people, in, bahia, were, called, samba, in, rio, de, janeiro, the, word, only, became, known, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, when, it, was, linked, to, rural, festivities, to, the, area, of, black, people, and, to, the, north, of, the, country, that, is, the, brazilian, northeast, for, many, years, of, the, brazilian, colonial, and, imperial, history, the, terms, batuque, or, samba, were, used, in, any, manifestation, of, african, origins, that, brought, together, dances, mainly, umbigada, songs, and, uses, of, black, people, instruments, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, samba, was, present, in, the, portuguese, language, designating, different, types, of, popular, dances, performed, by, african, slaves, xiba, fandango, cateret, candombl, bai, o, that, assumed, its, own, characteristics, in, each, brazilian, state, not, only, by, the, diversity, of, the, ethnic, groups, of, the, african, diaspora, but, also, the, peculiarity, of, each, region, in, which, they, were, settlers, in, the, twentieth, century, the, term, was, gaining, new, meanings, as, for, a, circle, dance, similar, to, batuque, and, a, genre, of, popular, song, the, use, of, the, word, in, a, musical, context, was, documented, as, early, as, 1913, in, the, em, casa, de, baiana, registered, as, samba, de, partido, alto, then, the, following, year, for, the, works, a, viola, est, magoada, and, moleque, vagabundo, and, in, 1916, for, the, famous, pelo, telefone, released, as, samba, carnavalesco, carnival, samba, and, regarded, as, the, founding, landmark, of, the, modern, carioca, samba, during, a, folkloric, research, mission, in, the, northeast, region, of, 1938, the, writer, m, rio, de, andrade, noticed, that, in, rural, areas, the, term, samba, was, associated, with, the, event, where, the, dance, was, performed, the, way, of, dancing, the, samba, and, the, music, performed, for, the, dance, the, urban, carioca, samba, was, influenced, by, several, traditions, associated, with, the, universe, of, rural, communities, throughout, brazil, the, folklorist, oneida, alvarenga, was, the, first, expert, to, list, primitive, popular, dances, of, the, type, coco, tambor, de, crioula, lundu, chula, or, fandango, baiano, cateret, quimbere, mbeque, caxambu, and, xiba, to, this, list, jorge, sabino, and, raul, lody, added, the, samba, de, coco, and, the, sambada, also, called, coco, de, roda, the, samba, de, matuto, the, samba, de, caboclo, and, the, jongo, one, of, the, most, important, forms, of, dance, in, the, constitution, of, the, choreography, of, the, carioca, samba, the, samba, de, roda, practiced, in, bahia, s, rec, ncavo, was, typically, danced, outdoors, by, a, soloist, while, other, participants, of, the, roda, took, charge, of, the, singing, alternating, in, solo, and, chorus, parts, and, the, performance, of, dance, instruments, the, three, basic, steps, of, bahian, samba, de, roda, were, the, corta, a, jaca, the, separa, o, visgo, and, the, apanha, o, bago, in, addition, to, the, little, one, danced, exclusively, by, women, in, their, research, on, bahian, samba, roberto, mendes, and, waldomiro, junior, examined, that, some, elements, from, other, cultures, such, as, the, arab, pandeiro, and, the, portuguese, viola, were, gradually, incorporated, into, the, singing, and, rhythm, of, african, batuques, whose, most, well, known, variants, were, samba, corrido, and, the, samba, chulado, in, the, s, o, paulo, state, another, primitive, modality, of, known, rural, samba, developed, practiced, basically, in, cities, along, the, tiet, river, from, the, s, o, paulo, city, until, its, middle, course, and, traditionally, divided, between, samba, de, bumbo, with, only, instruments, percussion, with, bumbo, and, batuque, de, umbigada, with, tambu, quinjengue, and, guai, essentially, made, up, of, two, parts, choir, and, solo, usually, performed, on, the, fly, the, partido, alto, was, and, still, is, the, most, traditional, sung, variant, of, rural, samba, in, rio, de, janeiro, state, originating, in, the, greater, rio, de, janeiro, it, is, the, combination, according, to, lopes, and, simas, of, the, bahian, samba, de, roda, with, the, singing, of, the, calango, as, well, as, a, kind, of, transition, between, rural, samba, and, what, would, be, developed, in, the, urban, environment, of, rio, from, the, 20th, century, in, its, beginnings, samba, was, heavily, criminalized, by, the, brazilian, government, born, in, the, favelas, it, was, a, distinctly, afro, brazilian, musical, genre, that, brought, people, together, in, community, and, celebration, but, that, to, the, brazilian, elite, was, threatening, samba, s, incorporation, of, african, drumming, was, thought, to, be, a, connection, to, afro, brazilian, cults, many, early, composers, were, thought, to, be, leaders, of, african, cults, and, for, this, connection, samba, faced, policed, persecution, any, samba, gathering, was, swiftly, shut, down, with, musicians, arrested, and, their, instruments, destroyed, as, a, result, samba, had, to, go, underground, it, relied, on, community, members, to, assume, the, risk, of, persecution, to, have, samba, parties, out, of, their, homes, ultimately, samba, became, a, hallmark, of, brazilian, culture, highlighted, at, carnival, but, it, was, not, always, that, way, as, in, its, origins, practicing, samba, was, defiance, against, the, government, during, colonial, brazil, many, public, catholic, events, used, to, attract, all, social, segments, including, black, and, enslaved, peoples, who, took, advantage, of, the, celebrations, to, make, their, own, manifestations, such, as, the, crowning, revelry, of, the, congo, kings, and, the, cucumbis, bantu, revelry, in, rio, de, janeiro, gradually, these, exclusive, celebrations, of, the, black, people, were, being, disconnected, from, catholicism, ceremonies, and, changed, to, the, brazilian, carnival, from, the, cucumbis, the, cariocas, cord, es, emerged, which, presented, elements, of, brazilianness, like, black, people, in, indigenous, dress, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, on, the, initiative, of, hil, rio, jovino, from, pernambuco, ranchos, de, reis, later, known, as, carnival, ranchos, emerged, one, of, the, most, important, ranches, in, rio, s, carnival, was, ameno, resed, created, in, 1907, the, self, titled, rancho, escola, became, a, model, for, carnival, performances, in, procession, and, for, future, samba, schools, born, in, the, hills, and, suburbs, of, rio, a, political, and, socio, cultural, epicenter, of, brazil, based, on, slavery, rio, de, janeiro, was, strongly, influenced, by, african, culture, in, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, more, than, half, the, population, of, the, city, then, capital, of, the, brazilian, empire, was, formed, by, black, slaves, in, the, early, 1890s, rio, had, more, than, half, a, million, inhabitants, of, whom, only, half, were, born, in, the, city, while, the, other, part, came, from, the, old, brazilian, imperial, provinces, mainly, from, bahia, in, search, of, better, living, conditions, this, influx, of, black, bahians, to, rio, lands, increased, considerably, after, the, abolition, of, slavery, in, brazil, called, pequena, africa, little, africa, by, heitor, dos, prazeres, this, afro, bahian, diaspora, community, in, the, country, s, capital, settled, in, the, vicinity, of, the, rio, de, janeiro, port, area, and, after, the, urban, reforms, of, mayor, pereira, passos, in, the, neighborhoods, of, sa, de, and, cidade, nova, through, the, action, of, black, bahians, living, in, rio, new, habits, customs, and, values, of, afro, bahian, matrixes, were, introduced, that, influenced, the, culture, of, rio, especially, in, popular, events, such, as, the, traditional, festa, da, penha, and, carnival, black, women, from, salvador, and, bahia, s, rec, ncavo, the, tias, baianas, bahian, aunts, founded, the, first, candombl, terreiros, introduced, the, cowrie, shell, divination, and, disseminated, the, mysteries, of, the, african, based, religions, of, the, jeje, nag, tradition, in, the, city, in, addition, to, candombl, the, residences, or, terreiros, of, the, aunts, of, bahia, hosted, various, community, activities, such, as, cooking, and, the, pagodes, where, urban, rio, samba, would, develop, among, the, most, well, known, bahian, aunts, in, rio, were, the, tias, sadata, bibiana, f, rosa, ol, am, lia, do, arag, o, veridiana, m, nica, perciliana, de, santo, amaro, and, ciata, a, place, for, meetings, around, religion, cuisine, dance, and, music, tia, ciata, s, home, was, frequented, both, by, samba, musicians, and, pais, de, santo, as, well, as, by, influential, intellectuals, and, politicians, from, rio, de, janeiro, society, among, some, of, its, members, regulars, were, sinh, pixinguinha, heitor, dos, prazeres, jo, o, da, baiana, donga, and, caninha, as, well, as, some, journalists, and, intellectuals, such, as, jo, o, do, rio, manuel, bandeira, m, rio, de, andrade, and, francisco, guimar, es, popularly, known, as, vagalume, it, was, in, this, environment, that, vagalume, then, a, columnist, for, jornal, do, brasil, witnessed, the, birth, of, o, macaco, outro, in, october, 1916, according, to, the, journalist, this, samba, immediately, won, the, support, of, the, popular, people, who, left, singing, the, music, in, an, animated, block, donga, registered, the, work, in, sheet, music, and, on, 27, november, of, that, year, declared, himself, as, its, author, in, the, national, library, where, it, was, registered, as, carnival, samba, called, pelo, telefone, shortly, after, the, score, was, used, in, three, recordings, at, casa, edison, record, label, one, of, them, interpreted, by, baiano, with, the, accompaniment, of, classical, guitar, cavaquinho, and, clarinet, released, in, 78, rpm, format, on, 19, january, 1917, pelo, telefone, became, a, huge, hit, in, that, year, s, rio, carnival, two, instrumental, versions, were, also, released, recorded, by, banda, odeon, and, banda, de, 1, battalion, of, the, police, of, bahia, in, 1917, and, 1918, respectively, the, success, of, pelo, telefone, marked, the, official, beginning, of, samba, as, a, song, genre, its, primacy, as, the, first, samba, in, history, has, however, been, questioned, by, some, scholars, on, the, grounds, that, the, work, was, only, the, first, samba, under, this, categorization, to, be, successful, before, em, casa, da, baiana, was, recorded, by, alfredo, carlos, bricio, declared, to, the, national, library, as, samba, de, partido, alto, in, 1913, a, viola, est, magoada, by, catulo, da, paix, o, cearense, released, as, samba, by, baiano, and, j, lia, the, following, year, and, moleque, vagabundo, samba, by, lourival, de, carvalho, also, in, 1914, another, debate, related, to, pelo, telefone, concerns, donga, s, exclusive, authorship, which, was, soon, contested, by, some, of, his, contemporaries, who, accused, him, of, appropriating, a, collective, anonymous, creation, registering, it, as, his, own, the, central, part, of, the, song, would, have, been, conceived, in, the, traditional, improvisations, in, meetings, at, tia, ciata, s, house, sinh, claimed, the, authorship, of, the, chorus, ai, se, rolinha, sinh, sinh, and, created, another, song, lyrics, in, response, to, donga, however, sinh, himself, who, would, consolidate, himself, in, the, 1920s, as, the, first, important, figure, of, samba, was, accused, of, appropriating, other, people, s, songs, or, verses, to, which, he, justified, himself, with, the, famous, maxim, that, samba, was, like, a, bird, in, the, air, it, is, whoever, gets, it, first, this, defense, is, part, of, a, period, in, which, the, figure, of, the, popular, composer, was, not, that, of, the, individual, who, composed, or, organized, sounds, but, the, one, who, registered, and, disseminated, the, songs, in, the, era, of, mechanical, recordings, musical, compositions, under, the, pretext, of, ensuring, that, there, was, no, plagiarism, did, not, belong, to, composers, but, to, publishers, and, later, to, record, labels, a, reality, modified, only, with, the, advent, of, electrical, recordings, when, the, right, to, intellectual, property, of, the, work, became, individual, and, inalienable, to, the, composer, in, any, case, it, was, because, pelo, telefone, that, samba, gained, notoriety, as, a, product, in, the, brazilian, music, industry, gradually, the, nascent, urban, samba, was, gaining, popularity, in, rio, de, janeiro, especially, at, the, festa, da, penha, and, carnival, in, october, the, festa, da, penha, became, a, great, event, for, composers, from, cidade, nova, who, wanted, to, publicize, their, compositions, in, the, expectation, that, they, would, be, released, at, the, following, carnival, another, promoter, during, this, period, was, the, revue, shows, a, place, that, enshrined, aracy, cortes, as, one, of, the, first, successful, singers, of, the, new, popular, song, genre, the, solidification, of, the, electric, recording, system, made, it, possible, for, the, recording, industry, to, launch, new, sambas, by, singers, with, less, powerful, voices, such, as, carmen, miranda, and, m, rio, reis, performers, who, became, references, when, creating, a, new, way, of, interpreting, the, most, natural, and, spontaneous, samba, without, so, many, ornaments, as, opposed, to, the, tradition, of, belcanto, style, these, recordings, followed, an, aesthetic, pattern, characterized, by, structural, similarities, to, the, lundu, and, mainly, to, the, maxixe, because, of, this, this, type, of, samba, is, considered, by, scholars, as, samba, maxixe, or, samba, amaxixado, although, the, samba, practiced, in, the, festivities, of, bahian, communities, in, rio, was, an, urban, stylization, of, the, ancestral, samba, de, roda, in, bahia, characterized, by, a, high, party, samba, with, refrains, sung, to, the, marked, rhythm, of, the, palms, and, the, plates, shaved, with, knives, this, samba, it, was, also, influenced, by, the, maxixe, it, was, in, the, following, decade, that, a, new, model, of, samba, would, be, born, from, the, hills, of, rio, de, janeiro, quite, distinct, from, that, of, the, amaxixado, style, associated, with, the, communities, of, cidade, nova, between, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, and, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, in, the, context, of, the, first, brazilian, republic, the, poor, strata, of, rio, de, janeiro, faced, serious, economic, issues, related, to, their, survival, in, the, federal, capital, such, as, the, imposition, of, new, taxes, resulting, from, the, provision, of, public, services, such, as, electric, lighting, water, and, sewage, modern, pavements, new, legislation, that, imposed, architectural, norms, and, restrictions, for, urban, buildings, and, the, prohibition, on, the, exercise, of, certain, professions, or, economic, practices, linked, to, subsistence, especially, of, the, poorest, the, situation, of, this, population, worsened, further, with, the, urban, reforms, in, the, center, of, rio, whose, widening, or, opening, of, roads, required, the, destruction, of, several, tenements, and, popular, housing, in, the, region, as, a, result, these, homeless, residents, were, temporarily, occupying, slopes, in, the, vicinity, of, these, old, demolished, buildings, such, as, morro, da, provid, ncia, mainly, occupied, by, former, residents, of, the, cabe, a, de, porco, tenement, and, former, soldiers, of, the, war, of, canudos, and, morro, de, santo, antonio, especially, by, ex, combatants, of, the, brazilian, naval, revolts, in, a, short, time, this, type, of, temporary, housing, was, permanently, established, in, the, urban, landscape, of, rio, originating, the, first, favelas, in, the, city, from, the, increase, in, the, populations, expelled, from, the, tenements, and, the, arrival, of, new, poor, migrants, to, the, capital, of, the, republic, the, favelas, grew, rapidly, and, spread, through, the, hills, settlements, and, suburban, areas, of, rio, it, was, in, this, scenario, that, a, new, type, of, samba, would, be, born, during, the, second, half, of, the, 1920s, called, samba, do, est, cio, which, would, constitute, the, genesis, of, urban, carioca, samba, by, creating, a, new, pattern, so, revolutionary, that, its, innovations, last, until, the, days, current, located, close, to, pra, a, onze, and, housing, morro, do, s, o, carlos, the, neighborhood, of, est, cio, was, a, center, of, convergence, of, public, transport, mainly, of, trams, that, served, the, north, zone, of, the, city, its, proximity, to, the, nascent, hills, settlements, as, well, as, its, primacy, in, the, formation, of, this, new, samba, ended, up, linking, its, musical, production, from, urban, train, lines, to, the, favelas, and, suburbs, of, rio, such, as, morro, da, mangueira, and, the, suburban, neighborhood, of, osvaldo, cruz, est, cio, s, samba, was, distinguished, from, cidade, nova, s, samba, both, in, thematic, aspects, as, well, as, in, the, melody, and, rhythm, made, for, the, parades, of, the, carnival, blocs, in, the, neighborhood, the, samba, do, est, cio, innovated, with, a, faster, tempo, longer, notes, and, a, cadence, beyond, the, traditional, palms, another, structural, change, resulting, from, this, samba, was, the, valorization, of, the, second, part, of, the, compositions, instead, of, using, the, typical, improvisation, of, the, samba, circles, of, the, alto, party, or, carnival, parades, there, was, the, consolidation, of, pre, established, sequences, which, would, have, a, theme, for, example, everyday, problems, and, the, possibility, of, fitting, everything, within, the, standards, of, the, phonograph, recordings, of, 78, rpm, at, the, time, something, like, three, minutes, on, 10, inch, discs, in, comparison, to, the, works, of, the, first, generation, of, donga, sinh, and, company, the, sambas, produced, by, the, est, cio, group, also, stood, out, for, a, greater, countermetricity, which, can, be, evidenced, in, a, testimony, by, ismael, silva, about, the, innovations, introduced, by, him, and, his, companions, in, the, new, urban, samba, in, rio, at, that, time, samba, did, not, work, for, carnival, groups, to, walk, on, the, street, as, we, see, today, i, started, noticing, that, there, was, this, thing, the, samba, was, like, this, tan, tantan, tan, tantan, it, was, not, possible, how, would, a, bloc, get, out, on, the, street, like, that, then, we, started, making, a, samba, like, this, bum, bum, paticumbum, pugurumdum, the, intuitive, onomatopoeia, built, by, ismael, silva, tried, to, explain, the, rhythmic, change, operated, by, the, sambistas, of, est, cio, with, the, bum, bum, paticumbum, pugurumdum, of, the, surdo, in, marking, the, cadence, of, the, samba, making, it, a, more, syncopated, rhythm, it, was, therefore, a, break, with, the, samba, tan, tantan, tan, tantan, irradiated, from, the, bahian, aunts, meetings, thus, at, the, end, of, the, 1920s, the, modern, carioca, samba, had, two, distinct, models, the, primitive, urban, samba, of, cidade, nova, and, the, new, syncopated, samba, of, the, est, cio, group, however, while, the, bahian, community, enjoyed, a, certain, social, legitimacy, including, the, protection, of, important, personalities, of, rio, society, who, supported, and, frequented, the, musical, circles, of, the, pequena, africa, the, new, estaciano, sambistas, suffered, socio, cultural, discrimination, including, through, police, repression, a, popular, neighborhood, with, a, large, black, mixed, contingent, est, cio, was, one, of, the, great, strongholds, of, poor, samba, musicians, situated, between, marginality, and, social, integration, who, ended, up, being, stigmatized, by, the, upper, classes, in, rio, as, dangerous, rascals, because, of, this, infamous, brand, the, estaciano, samba, suffered, great, social, prejudice, in, its, origin, to, avoid, police, harassment, and, gain, social, legitimacy, est, cio, s, samba, musicians, decided, to, link, their, batucadas, to, carnival, samba, and, organized, themselves, in, what, they, christened, as, samba, schools, at, the, end, of, the, carnival, samba, has, continued, because, we, did, samba, all, year, at, caf, apolo, caf, do, compadre, across, the, street, at, the, backyard, feijoadas, or, at, dawn, on, street, corners, and, in, bars, then, the, police, used, to, come, and, bother, us, but, it, didn, t, bother, the, guys, of, carnival, rancho, amor, which, had, a, headquarter, and, license, to, parade, at, the, carnival, we, decided, to, organize, a, carnival, bloc, even, without, a, license, that, could, allow, us, to, go, out, at, the, carnival, and, do, samba, all, year, round, organization, and, respect, without, fights, or, huffing, were, important, it, was, called, deixa, falar, as, it, despises, the, middle, class, ladies, of, the, neighborhood, who, used, to, call, people, a, vagabond, we, were, malandros, in, a, good, way, but, vagabonds, weren, t, according, to, ismael, silva, also, a, founder, of, deixa, falar, and, the, creator, of, the, expression, samba, school, the, term, was, inspired, by, the, normal, school, that, once, existed, in, est, cio, and, therefore, the, samba, schools, would, form, samba, teachers, although, the, primacy, of, the, country, s, first, samba, school, is, contested, by, portela, and, mangueira, deixa, falar, was, a, pioneer, in, spreading, the, term, in, its, quest, to, establish, a, different, organization, from, the, carnival, blocks, of, that, time, and, also, the, first, carnival, association, to, use, the, group, in, the, future, known, as, bateria, a, unit, made, up, of, percussion, instruments, such, as, the, surdo, tambourines, and, cu, cas, which, when, joining, the, already, used, pandeiros, and, shakers, gave, a, more, marching, characteristic, to, the, samba, of, the, parades, in, 1929, the, sambista, and, babalawo, z, espinguela, organized, the, first, contest, among, the, first, samba, schools, in, rio, deixa, falar, mangueira, and, oswaldo, cruz, later, portela, the, dispute, did, not, involve, parede, but, a, competition, to, choose, the, best, samba, theme, among, these, carnival, groups, whose, winner, is, the, samba, a, tristeza, me, persegue, by, heitor, dos, prazeres, one, of, oswaldo, cruz, s, representatives, deixa, falar, was, disqualified, for, the, use, of, a, flute, and, tie, by, benedito, lacerda, then, representative, of, the, est, cio, group, this, veto, on, wind, instruments, became, the, rule, from, then, on, including, for, the, first, parade, between, them, organized, in, 1932, by, journalist, mario, filho, and, sponsored, by, the, daily, mundo, sportivo, because, it, differentiated, schools, from, carnival, ranchos, with, the, appreciation, of, batucadas, which, would, definitely, mark, the, aesthetic, bases, of, samba, from, then, on, est, cio, s, batucado, and, syncopated, samba, represented, an, aesthetic, break, with, cidade, nova, s, maxixe, style, samba, in, turn, the, first, generation, of, samba, did, not, accept, the, innovations, created, by, the, samba, musicians, of, the, hill, seen, as, a, misrepresentation, of, the, genre, or, even, designated, as, march, for, musicians, such, as, donga, and, sinh, samba, was, synonymous, with, maxixe, a, kind, of, the, last, brazilian, stage, of, european, polka, for, the, samba, musicians, from, the, hills, of, rio, samba, was, the, last, brazilian, stage, of, angolan, drumming, that, they, proposed, to, teach, to, brazilian, society, through, samba, schools, this, generational, conflict, however, did, not, last, for, long, and, est, cio, s, samba, established, itself, as, the, rhythm, par, excellence, of, rio, s, urban, samba, during, the, 1930s, between, 1931, and, 1940, samba, was, the, most, recorded, genre, music, in, brazil, with, almost, 1, 3, of, the, total, repertoire, 2, 176, sambas, songs, in, a, universe, of, 6, 706, compositions, sambas, and, marchinhas, together, made, up, the, percentages, just, over, half, of, the, repertoire, recorded, in, that, period, thanks, to, the, new, electric, recording, technology, it, was, possible, to, capture, the, percussive, instruments, present, in, samba, schools, the, samba, na, pavuna, performed, by, bando, de, tangar, s, was, the, first, recorded, in, studio, with, the, percussion, that, would, characterize, the, genre, from, there, tamborim, surdo, pandeiro, ganz, cu, ca, among, others, although, there, was, the, presence, of, these, percussive, instruments, the, samba, recordings, in, the, studio, were, characterized, by, the, predominance, of, musical, arrangements, of, orchestrated, tone, with, brass, and, string, instruments, this, orchestral, pattern, was, mainly, printed, by, european, arrangers, among, them, simon, bountman, romeu, ghipsmanm, isaac, kolman, and, arnold, gluckman, conductors, whose, erudite, formation, ended, up, giving, a, european, symphonic, sound, in, the, counter, metric, rhythm, and, batucada, of, the, samba, from, estacio, another, reason, for, the, success, of, the, new, samba, in, the, music, industry, was, the, introduction, of, the, second, part, which, stimulated, the, establishment, of, partnerships, between, the, composers, for, example, one, composer, created, the, chorus, of, a, samba, and, another, composer, conceived, the, second, part, as, occurred, in, the, partnership, between, ismael, silva, and, noel, rosa, in, para, me, livrar, do, mal, with, the, growing, demand, for, new, sambas, by, the, singers, the, practice, of, buying, and, selling, compositions, has, also, become, common, this, transaction, usually, took, place, in, two, different, ways, the, author, negotiated, only, the, sale, of, the, samba, recording, that, is, he, remained, as, the, author, of, the, composition, but, he, would, not, receive, any, part, of, the, gains, obtained, from, the, sales, of, the, records, which, were, divided, between, the, buyer, and, the, record, label, or, the, entire, composition, that, is, the, real, author, completely, lost, the, rights, to, his, samba, including, authorship, in, some, cases, the, sambista, sold, the, partnership, to, the, buyer, and, also, received, a, portion, of, the, profits, from, the, sales, of, the, records, selling, a, samba, meant, the, composer, had, a, chance, to, see, his, production, publicized, especially, when, he, did, not, yet, enjoy, the, same, prestige, acquired, by, the, first, generation, samba, composers, and, also, a, way, to, make, up, for, his, own, financial, difficulties, for, the, buyer, it, was, the, possibility, to, renew, his, repertoire, record, more, records, and, earn, sales, and, further, consolidate, his, artistic, career, artists, with, good, contact, with, record, labels, the, popular, singers, francisco, alves, and, m, rio, reis, were, adepts, of, this, practicea, having, acquired, sambas, from, composers, such, as, cartola, and, ismael, silva, the, 1930s, in, brazilian, music, marked, the, rise, of, est, cio, s, samba, as, a, musical, genre, to, the, detriment, of, maxixe, style, samba, if, the, samba, schools, were, crucial, to, delimit, publicize, and, legitimize, the, new, estaciano, samba, as, the, authentic, expression, of, the, rio, s, urban, samba, the, radio, also, played, a, decisive, role, in, popularizing, it, nationwide, although, broadcasting, in, brazil, was, officially, inaugurated, in, 1922, it, was, still, an, incipient, and, technical, experimental, and, restricted, telecommunication, medium, in, the, 1920s, rio, de, janeiro, was, home, to, only, two, short, range, radio, stations, whose, programming, was, basically, limited, to, broadcast, educational, content, or, classical, music, this, panorama, changed, radically, in, the, 1930s, with, the, political, rise, of, get, lio, vargas, who, identified, the, media, as, a, tool, of, public, interest, for, economic, educational, cultural, or, political, purposes, as, well, as, for, the, national, integration, of, the, country, a, 1932, vargas, decree, regulating, radio, advertising, was, crucial, to, the, commercial, professional, and, popular, transformation, of, brazilian, broadcasting, with, the, authorization, that, ads, could, occupy, 20, and, then, 25, of, the, programming, the, radio, became, more, attractive, and, safe, for, advertisers, and, added, to, the, increase, in, sales, of, radio, sets, in, the, period, transformed, this, telecommunication, medium, of, its, function, once, educational, for, an, entertainment, powerhouse, with, the, contribution, of, financial, resources, from, advertising, the, broadcasters, began, to, invest, in, musical, programming, turning, the, radio, into, the, great, popularizer, of, popular, music, in, the, brazil, whether, phonograph, record, or, live, recordings, directly, from, the, stations, auditoriums, and, studios, with, samba, as, a, great, attraction, the, radio, gave, space, to, the, genre, with, the, sambas, de, carnaval, released, for, the, carnival, celebrations, and, the, sambas, de, meio, de, ano, mid, year, sambas, launched, throughout, the, year, this, expansion, of, radio, as, a, medium, of, mass, communication, enabled, the, formation, of, professional, technicians, linked, to, sound, activities, as, well, as, for, singers, arrangers, and, composers, from, this, scenario, broadcasters, ademar, cas, in, rio, and, c, sar, ladeira, in, s, o, paulo, stood, out, as, pioneers, in, the, establishment, of, exclusive, contracts, with, singers, for, presentation, in, live, programs, that, is, instead, of, receiving, only, one, fee, per, presentation, the, monthly, remuneration, was, fixed, to, pay, the, artists, a, model, that, triggered, a, fierce, dispute, between, radio, stations, to, form, its, professional, and, exclusive, casts, with, popular, stars, of, brazilian, music, and, also, philharmonic, orchestras, the, most, important, samba, singers, such, as, carmen, miranda, started, signing, advantageous, contracts, to, work, exclusively, with, a, certain, radio, station, the, institution, of, auditorium, programs, created, the, need, to, set, up, big, radio, orchestras, conducted, by, arranging, conductors, which, gave, a, more, sophisticated, look, to, brazilian, popular, music, one, of, the, most, notorious, orchestral, formations, on, the, radio, was, the, orquestra, brasileira, under, the, command, of, conductor, radam, s, gnatalli, and, with, a, team, of, musicians, such, as, the, sambistas, jo, o, da, baiana, bide, and, heitor, dos, prazeres, in, percussion, which, combined, standards, of, the, international, song, at, that, time, with, popular, instruments, in, brazilian, music, such, as, the, cavaquinho, the, orquestra, brasileira, was, notable, for, the, success, of, the, program, um, milh, o, de, melodias, one, million, melodies, by, r, dio, nacional, one, of, the, most, popular, in, the, history, of, brazilian, radio, in, this, golden, age, of, radio, broadcasting, in, brazil, a, new, generation, of, composers, from, the, middle, class, emerged, such, as, ary, barroso, ataulfo, alves, braguinha, lamartine, babo, and, noel, rosa, who, have, built, successful, careers, in, this, media, grown, up, in, the, vila, isabel, middle, class, neighborhood, noel, rosa, was, instrumental, in, destigmatizing, the, samba, do, est, cio, although, he, started, his, musical, trajectory, by, composing, northeastern, emboladas, and, similar, brazilian, rural, music, genres, the, composer, changed, his, style, by, having, contact, with, the, samba, made, and, sung, by, the, sambistas, from, est, cio, and, others, hills, of, rio, this, meeting, resulted, in, friendships, and, partnerships, between, noel, and, names, as, ismael, silva, and, cartola, among, singers, in, addition, to, noel, himself, a, new, generation, of, performers, broke, out, such, as, jonjoca, castro, barbosa, lu, s, barbosa, cyro, monteiro, dilermando, pinheiro, aracy, de, almeida, mar, lia, batista, another, highlight, was, the, singer, carmen, miranda, the, greatest, star, of, brazilian, popular, music, at, that, time, and, the, first, artist, to, promote, samba, internationally, renowned, in, brazil, carmen, continued, her, successful, artistic, career, in, the, united, states, where, she, worked, in, musicals, in, new, york, city, and, later, in, hollywood, cinema, her, popularity, was, such, that, she, even, performed, at, the, white, house, for, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, the, consolidation, of, samba, as, the, flagship, of, the, radio, programming, of, rio, de, janeiro, was, characterized, by, the, association, of, the, musical, genre, with, the, image, of, white, artists, who, even, when, proletarianized, were, more, palatable, to, the, preference, of, the, public, while, the, poor, black, sambistas, remained, normally, on, the, sidelines, of, this, process, as, a, mere, supplier, of, compositions, for, the, white, performers, or, as, instrumentalists, accompanying, them, this, strong, presence, of, white, singers, and, composers, was, also, decisive, for, the, acceptance, and, appreciation, of, samba, by, the, economic, and, cultural, elites, of, brazil, from, this, the, middle, class, started, to, recognize, the, value, of, the, rhythm, invented, by, black, brazilians, the, municipal, theater, of, rio, became, the, stage, for, elegant, carnival, balls, attended, by, the, high, society, having, contact, with, the, popular, genre, through, samba, and, choro, circles, meetings, the, renowned, conductor, heitor, villa, lobos, promoted, a, musical, meeting, between, the, american, maestro, leopold, stokowski, with, the, sambistas, cartola, z, da, zilda, z, espinguela, donga, jo, o, da, baiana, and, others, the, recording, results, were, edited, in, the, united, states, on, several, 78, rpm, discs, another, privileged, space, for, the, white, rich, elite, in, the, brazilian, society, was, the, casinos, which, peaked, in, brazil, during, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, in, addition, to, working, with, games, of, chance, these, elegant, amusement, houses, offered, restaurant, and, bar, services, and, were, the, stage, for, shows, among, which, samba, also, featured, prominently, thus, the, casinos, signed, exclusive, contracts, with, major, artists, as, was, the, case, with, carmen, miranda, as, a, big, star, at, cassino, da, urca, in, an, unusual, event, for, the, universe, of, sambistas, on, the, hill, composer, cartola, performed, for, a, month, at, the, luxurious, casino, atl, ntico, in, copacabana, in, 1940, the, consolidation, of, samba, among, brazilian, elites, was, also, influenced, by, the, valorization, of, the, ideology, of, miscegenation, in, vogue, with, the, construction, of, nationalism, under, the, getulio, vargas, regime, from, an, image, of, a, symbol, of, national, backwardness, the, mestizo, became, a, representative, of, brazilian, singularities, and, samba, with, its, mestizo, origin, ended, up, linked, to, the, construction, of, national, identity, having, acted, decisively, for, the, growth, of, radio, in, brazil, the, vargas, government, perceived, samba, as, a, vital, element, in, the, construction, of, this, idea, of, miscegenation, samba, s, triumph, over, the, airwaves, allowed, it, to, penetrate, all, sectors, of, brazilian, society, especially, under, the, estado, novo, whose, ideological, cultural, policy, of, reconceptualizing, the, popular, and, extolling, everything, that, was, considered, an, authentic, national, expression, samba, was, elevated, to, the, position, of, major, national, symbol, of, the, country, and, the, official, pace, of, the, country, however, one, of, the, concerns, of, the, vargas, regime, was, to, interfere, in, music, production, to, promote, samba, as, a, means, of, pedagogical, socialization, that, is, by, banning, compositions, that, confront, the, regime, s, ethics, in, this, quest, to, civilize, samba, political, bodies, such, as, the, department, of, press, and, propaganda, dip, departamento, de, imprensa, e, propaganda, took, action, to, order, sambas, that, would, exalt, the, work, and, censor, lyrics, that, addressed, bohemia, and, malandragem, two, of, the, most, common, themes, in, the, tradition, of, the, urban, carioca, samba, musical, contests, were, also, instituted, through, which, public, opinion, elected, its, favorite, composers, and, performers, under, vargas, samba, had, an, expressive, weight, in, the, construction, of, an, image, of, brazil, abroad, and, was, an, important, means, of, cultural, and, tourist, dissemination, of, the, country, in, an, attempt, to, reinforce, a, positive, national, image, the, presence, of, renowned, singers, of, the, kind, in, presidential, committees, to, latin, american, countries, has, become, frequent, at, the, end, of, 1937, the, sambistas, paulo, da, portela, and, heitor, dos, prazeres, participated, in, a, caravan, of, brazilian, artists, to, montevideo, that, performed, at, the, gran, exposici, n, feria, internacional, del, uruguay, the, brazilian, government, also, financed, an, information, and, popular, music, program, called, uma, hora, do, brasil, produced, and, broadcast, by, radio, el, mundo, from, buenos, aires, which, had, at, least, one, broadcast, to, nazi, germany, when, the, vargas, regime, approached, the, united, states, dip, made, an, agreement, to, broadcast, brazilian, radio, programs, on, hundreds, of, cbs, radio, network, under, this, context, the, samba, aquarela, do, brasil, by, ary, barroso, was, released, in, the, united, states, market, becoming, the, first, brazilian, song, that, was, very, successful, abroad, and, one, of, the, most, popular, works, of, the, brazilian, popular, songbook, in, the, midst, of, the, good, neighborhood, policy, the, animator, walt, disney, visited, portela, samba, school, during, his, visit, to, brazil, in, 1941, from, which, he, hypothesized, that, z, carioca, a, character, created, by, the, cartoonist, to, express, the, brazilian, way, would, have, been, inspired, by, the, figure, of, the, sambista, paulo, da, portela, the, rise, of, samba, as, a, popular, musical, genre, in, brazil, also, relied, on, its, dissemination, in, brazilian, cinema, especially, in, musical, comedies, being, an, integral, part, of, the, soundtrack, the, plot, or, even, the, main, theme, of, the, cinematographic, work, the, good, public, acceptance, of, the, short, film, a, voz, do, carnaval, by, adhemar, gonzaga, paved, the, way, for, several, other, cinematographic, works, related, to, rhythm, many, of, which, had, a, strong, presence, of, radio, idol, singers, in, the, cast, such, as, al, al, brasil, which, had, sisters, carmen, and, aurora, miranda, francisco, alves, m, rio, reis, dircinha, batista, bando, da, lua, almirante, lamartine, babo, among, others, the, advent, of, the, popular, chanchada, films, made, brazilian, cinema, one, of, the, biggest, promoters, of, carnival, music, in, one, of, the, rare, moments, when, sambistas, from, the, hill, starred, in, radio, programs, paulo, da, portela, heitor, dos, prazeres, and, cartola, led, the, program, a, voz, do, morro, at, r, dio, cruzeiro, do, sul, in, 1941, there, they, presented, unpublished, sambas, whose, titles, were, given, by, listeners, however, over, the, course, of, the, decade, the, samba, made, by, these, genuine, sambistas, was, losing, space, on, brazilian, radio, to, new, sub, genres, that, were, being, formed, while, figures, such, as, cartola, and, ismael, silva, were, ostracized, until, they, left, the, music, scene, in, the, late, 1940s, thanks, to, its, economic, exploitation, through, the, radio, and, the, records, samba, not, only, became, professional, but, also, diversified, into, new, sub, genres, many, of, which, were, different, from, the, hues, originating, in, the, hills, of, rio, de, janeiro, and, established, by, the, interests, of, the, brazilian, music, industry, the, period, of, brazilian, music, between, 1929, and, 1945, marked, by, the, arrival, of, radio, and, electromagnetic, recording, of, sound, in, the, country, and, by, the, notability, of, major, composers, and, singers, the, so, called, golden, age, registered, several, styles, of, samba, some, with, greater, and, others, with, less, solidity, publications, devoted, to, the, topic, disseminated, a, broad, conceptual, terminology, including, denominations, later, enshrined, in, new, sub, genres, such, as, samba, can, o, samba, choro, samba, enredo, samba, exalta, o, samba, de, terreiro, samba, de, breque, as, well, as, registered, scores, and, released, labels, and, album, covers, printed, various, nomenclatures, for, samba, in, an, attempt, to, express, a, functional, rhythmic, or, thematic, trend, such, as, samba, moda, baiana, samba, in, the, bahian, style, samba, batucada, samba, jongo, samba, maxixe, although, some, sounded, quite, inconsistent, such, as, samba, moda, agri, o, samba, in, the, watercress, style, samba, epistolar, epistolary, samba, and, samba, fon, tico, phonetic, samba, in, other, cases, it, was, music, critics, that, imputed, pejorative, labels, with, a, view, to, disapproving, certain, aesthetic, changes, or, fashion, trends, as, in, the, disparagingly, called, sambalada, and, sambolero, for, stylistic, nuances, the, samba, can, o, established, in, the, radio, era, as, one, of, the, main, sub, genres, of, samba, the, samba, can, o, style, emerged, among, professional, musicians, who, played, in, the, revues, of, rio, de, janeiro, in, the, late, 1920s, and, early, 1930s, although, the, term, began, to, circulating, in, the, press, in, 1929, to, mistakenly, designate, jura, by, sinh, and, diz, que, me, amas, by, j, machado, the, starting, point, of, the, line, was, linda, flor, ai, ioi, a, melody, by, henrique, vogeler, and, lyrics, by, luis, peixoto, released, in, the, revue, and, on, disc, by, singer, aracy, cortes, in, general, the, samba, can, o, was, characterized, as, a, slower, tempo, variant, with, a, dominance, of, the, melodic, line, over, the, rhythmic, marking, that, basically, explores, the, subjectivity, of, subjectivity, and, feeling, as, their, releases, took, place, outside, the, carnival, season, the, trend, was, linked, to, the, so, called, mid, year, samba, however, during, the, 1930s, the, term, samba, can, o, was, used, arbitrarily, to, designate, many, compositions, contained, under, the, name, of, samba, de, meio, de, ano, mid, year, samba, but, which, did, not, fit, as, samba, can, o, themselves, on, the, other, hand, many, sambas, at, the, time, of, their, releases, would, later, be, recognized, as, samba, can, o, as, in, the, case, of, works, by, noel, rosa, and, ary, barroso, not, by, chance, zuza, homem, de, mello, and, jairo, severiano, consider, that, this, samba, style, was, truly, inaugurated, with, the, second, version, of, the, song, no, rancho, fundo, with, melody, by, ary, barroso, and, lyrics, by, lamartine, babo, basically, carnaval, was, reserved, for, the, launch, of, marchinhas, and, sambas, enredo, a, sub, genre, typified, in, this, way, in, the, 1930s, because, of, the, lyrics, and, melody, which, must, comprise, the, poetic, summary, of, the, theme, chosen, by, the, samba, school, for, its, carnival, parade, samba, de, terreiro, or, also, samba, de, quadra, was, a, short, tempo, samba, modality, with, the, second, most, measured, part, that, prepares, the, bateria, for, a, more, lively, return, to, the, beginning, its, format, was, also, consolidated, in, the, 1930s, also, from, that, time, samba, choro, at, first, called, choro, can, o, or, choro, cantado, was, a, syncopated, hybrid, sub, genre, of, samba, with, the, instrumental, music, genre, choro, but, with, medium, tempo, and, presence, of, lyrics, created, by, the, brazilian, music, industry, it, was, released, with, all, indications, with, amor, em, excesso, by, gad, and, valfrido, silva, in, 1932, one, of, the, most, popular, sambas, of, this, variant, is, carinhoso, by, pixinguinha, released, as, choro, in, 1917, received, lyrics, and, ended, up, relaunched, two, decades, later, in, the, voice, of, orlando, silva, with, great, commercial, success, in, the, following, decade, waldir, azevedo, would, popularize, chorinho, a, kind, of, fast, moving, instrumental, samba, widespread, during, the, estado, novo, samba, exalta, o, was, a, sub, genre, marked, by, the, character, of, grandeur, expressed, notably, by, the, extensive, melody, the, lyrics, with, a, patriotic, ufanist, theme, and, by, the, lavish, orchestral, arrangement, its, great, paradigm, was, aquarela, do, brasil, by, ary, barroso, from, the, huge, success, of, the, first, version, recorded, by, francisco, alves, in, 1939, samba, exalta, o, started, to, be, well, cultivated, by, professional, composers, in, the, musical, theater, and, in, the, music, industry, and, radio, media, another, well, known, samba, of, this, type, was, brasil, pandeiro, by, assis, valente, a, huge, hit, with, the, vocal, group, anjos, do, inferno, in, 1941, at, the, turn, of, the, 1940s, samba, de, breque, emerged, a, sub, genre, marked, by, a, markedly, syncopated, rhythm, and, sudden, stops, called, breques, from, english, word, break, brazilian, term, for, car, brakes, to, which, the, singer, added, spoken, comments, generally, humorous, in, character, alluding, to, the, theme, the, singer, moreira, da, silva, consolidated, himself, as, the, great, name, of, this, sub, genre, after, the, end, of, the, world, war, ii, and, the, consequent, growth, in, the, production, of, consumer, goods, radio, sets, spread, in, the, brazilian, market, in, different, models, and, at, affordable, prices, to, the, different, social, class, of, the, brazilian, population, within, this, context, brazilian, radio, broadcasting, also, went, through, a, moment, of, change, in, language, and, audience, that, made, radio, an, even, more, popular, media, in, brazil, in, search, of, easier, communication, with, the, listener, the, programming, standard, became, more, sensational, melodramatic, and, appealing, one, of, the, best, expressions, of, this, new, format, and, the, new, popular, audience, was, the, auditorium, programs, and, the, kings, and, radio, queen, contests, although, they, played, a, role, in, legitimizing, samba, as, a, cultural, product, and, national, symbol, music, and, also, transforming, popular, musical, culture, with, the, circulation, of, new, musical, genres, and, more, extroverted, performances, auditorium, programs, such, as, the, paradigmatic, programa, c, sar, de, alencar, and, programa, manoel, barcelos, both, on, radio, nacional, leader, in, audience, and, main, media, of, communication, in, brazil, stimulated, the, cult, of, personality, and, the, private, life, of, artists, whose, apex, was, the, collective, frenzy, generated, around, the, fan, clubs, of, popular, music, stars, during, the, concourses, of, kings, and, queens, of, the, radio, for, the, samba, more, linked, to, the, traditions, of, est, cio, and, the, hills, the, 1950s, was, characterized, by, the, vitalizing, presence, of, old, and, new, composers, who, led, the, renewal, of, the, genre, for, the, next, years, this, renewal, was, present, in, the, sambas, of, well, known, authors, from, the, general, public, such, as, geraldo, pereira, and, wilson, batista, of, lesser, known, sambistas, but, active, in, their, communities, such, as, z, keti, and, nelson, cavaquinho, a, composer, who, would, establish, a, great, partnership, with, guilherme, de, brito, and, also, of, new, composers, such, as, monsueto, the, samba, de, breque, by, jorge, veiga, also, stood, out, and, in, s, o, paulo, the, dem, nios, da, garoa, enshrined, the, sambas, by, adoniran, barbosa, missing, for, many, years, samba, composer, cartola, was, found, washing, cars, in, ipanema, by, journalist, s, rgio, porto, who, took, him, to, sing, on, r, dio, mayrink, veiga, and, got, him, a, job, at, a, newspaper, as, part, of, the, celebrations, of, the, fourth, centenary, of, the, city, of, s, o, paulo, the, composer, almirante, organized, the, festival, da, velha, guarda, old, guard, festival, which, brought, together, great, names, of, brazilian, popular, music, then, forgotten, such, as, donga, ismael, silva, and, pixinguinha, however, the, period, between, the, second, half, of, the, 1940s, and, the, end, of, the, 1950s, well, known, as, post, war, was, deeply, characterized, by, the, prestige, and, dominance, of, samba, can, o, in, the, brazilian, music, scene, although, in, its, time, of, appearance, there, were, not, so, many, releases, characteristic, of, this, aspect, many, achieved, huge, commercial, success, and, in, the, mid, 1940s, this, sub, genre, began, to, dominate, brazilian, radio, programming, and, be, the, most, played, style, outside, the, carnival, era, this, rise, of, samba, can, o, as, a, hegemonic, musical, style, was, also, accompanied, mainly, by, the, avalanche, of, foreign, musical, genres, imported, to, brazil, under, the, political, cultural, context, of, world, war, ii, that, began, to, compete, in, the, country, s, market, with, the, samba, can, o, itself, tango, and, especially, bolero, which, occupied, a, significant, part, of, radio, programming, proliferated, in, clubs, and, dance, halls, in, rio, de, janeiro, and, s, o, paulo, music, from, the, united, states, has, also, come, to, occupy, a, large, part, of, the, programming, of, brazilian, radio, stations, with, big, bands, in, evidence, some, radio, stations, made, great, publicity, about, jazz, a, genre, that, was, gaining, more, and, more, appreciation, among, some, musicians, from, rio, de, janeiro, especially, those, who, worked, in, nightclubs, in, a, samba, can, o, rhythm, many, boleros, foxtrots, and, french, songs, were, also, part, of, the, repertoire, of, nightclub, pianists, under, the, influence, of, the, strong, penetration, of, these, imported, genres, the, post, war, samba, can, o, itself, was, influenced, by, these, rhythms, in, certain, cases, the, change, occurred, through, a, musical, treatment, based, on, the, cool, jazz, tones, and, more, restrained, vocal, performances, and, more, complex, melodic, harmonic, structures, distinct, therefore, from, the, rhythmic, bodily, sensuality, of, traditional, samba, in, other, cases, it, was, due, to, the, strong, passionate, exercised, by, bolero, and, foreign, sentimental, ballads, both, influences, displeased, the, more, traditionalist, critics, in, the, first, they, accused, the, samba, can, o, of, having, jazzed, up, especially, for, the, sophisticated, orchestra, arrangements, in, the, second, the, slower, and, more, romantic, progress, of, the, slope, led, to, pejorative, labels, such, as, sambolero, or, sambalada, in, fact, the, orchestral, accompaniments, of, the, samba, can, o, at, that, time, were, marked, by, arrangements, containing, woodwinds, and, strings, that, replaced, the, traditional, regional, musical, ensemble, and, made, it, possible, to, dramatize, the, arrangements, in, accordance, with, the, theme, of, the, songs, and, the, expressiveness, of, the, singers, if, for, some, critics, these, orchestral, and, melodic, harmonic, attributes, of, modern, 1950s, samba, can, o, came, from, post, war, american, culture, for, others, this, influence, was, much, more, latin, american, than, north, american, another, aesthetic, mark, of, the, period, was, the, vocal, performance, of, the, singers, of, this, style, of, samba, sometimes, more, inclined, to, the, lyrical, power, and, expressiveness, sometimes, more, supported, by, an, intonation, and, close, to, the, colloquial, dynamics, with, a, new, generation, of, performers, that, emerged, in, the, post, war, period, the, brazilian, music, scene, was, taken, over, by, emotional, and, painful, samba, can, o, songs, in, the, 1950s, this, sub, genre, was, divided, between, a, more, traditional, and, a, more, modern, generation, if, in, the, first, group, there, were, composers, such, as, lupic, nio, rodrigues, and, herivelto, martins, and, interpreters, such, as, nelson, gon, alves, dalva, de, oliveira, angela, maria, jamel, o, cauby, peixoto, and, elizeth, cardoso, the, second, group, had, as, main, exponents, dick, farney, l, cio, alves, tito, madi, nora, ney, dolores, duran, maysa, and, sylvia, telles, among, others, the, modern, samba, can, o, was, also, part, of, a, phase, of, dorival, caymmi, s, career, and, the, beginning, of, the, musical, work, of, antonio, carlos, jobim, one, of, the, great, names, of, the, new, style, of, samba, that, would, stylistically, mark, the, genre, and, brazilian, music, in, the, coming, years, the, period, between, juscelino, kubitschek, s, inauguration, in, 1956, until, the, political, crisis, in, the, jo, o, goulart, government, that, culminated, in, the, 1964, brazilian, coup, d, tat, was, characterized, by, great, effervescence, on, the, brazilian, music, scene, especially, in, rio, de, janeiro, although, it, lost, its, status, as, the, country, s, capital, after, the, inauguration, of, bras, lia, the, city, maintained, its, position, as, a, major, cultural, hub, in, the, country, and, urban, samba, whose, transformations, on, the, radio, the, music, industry, nightclubs, and, among, the, circles, of, university, middle, class, youth, resulted, in, bossa, nova, a, term, by, which, a, new, style, of, rhythmic, accompaniment, and, interpretation, of, samba, spread, from, the, south, zone, of, rio, de, janeiro, became, known, at, a, time, when, the, appeal, to, the, traditional, was, gaining, new, momentum, bossa, nova, would, mark, the, entire, structure, of, creation, and, listening, supported, by, established, genres, considering, that, it, sought, a, renewal, within, the, tradition, of, samba, initially, called, modern, samba, by, the, brazilian, music, critic, this, new, sub, genre, was, officially, inaugurated, with, the, composition, chega, de, saudade, by, antonio, carlos, jobim, and, vinicius, de, moraes, released, in, 1958, in, two, versions, one, sung, by, elizeth, cardoso, and, the, other, with, the, singer, songwriter, and, guitarist, jo, o, gilberto, a, bahian, born, living, in, rio, gilberto, radically, changed, the, way, of, interpreting, samba, until, then, changing, the, harmonies, with, the, introduction, of, unconventional, guitar, chords, and, revolutionizing, the, classic, syncope, of, the, genre, with, a, unique, rhythmic, division, these, formal, gilbertian, experiences, were, consolidated, in, the, studio, album, chega, de, saudade, released, in, 1959, and, triggered, the, emergence, of, an, artistic, movement, around, gilberto, and, others, professional, artists, such, as, antonio, carlos, jobim, vinicius, de, moraes, baden, powell, ala, de, costa, sylvia, telles, among, others, which, attracted, young, amateur, musicians, from, the, south, zone, of, rio, almost, all, from, the, middle, class, and, with, university, degrees, such, as, carlos, lyra, roberto, menescal, ronaldo, boscoli, and, nara, le, o, consolidated, in, the, following, years, as, a, type, of, concert, samba, non, dancing, and, comparable, to, american, cool, jazz, bossa, nova, has, become, a, sambistic, sub, genre, of, great, reputation, on, the, brazilian, music, scene, and, with, its, rhythm, more, assimilable, abroad, than, traditional, samba, became, known, worldwide, after, being, released, on, the, american, market, in, a, series, of, concerts, in, new, york, city, in, late, 1962, brazilian, bossa, nova, albums, were, reissued, in, several, countries, while, new, songs, and, albums, were, recorded, including, with, foreign, artists, several, of, these, works, with, the, samba, the, girl, from, ipanema, by, antonio, carlos, jobim, and, vinicius, de, moraes, at, the, frontline, became, major, international, successes, however, in, the, midst, of, the, turbulence, that, marked, the, brazilian, political, scene, at, the, time, the, movement, suffered, a, dissent, which, resulted, in, the, so, called, nationalist, current, with, the, intention, of, carrying, out, a, work, more, engaged, and, aligned, with, the, social, context, of, the, period, the, nationalist, bossa, novistas, formed, around, nara, le, o, carlos, lyra, s, rgio, ricardo, edu, lobo, and, the, partnership, between, vinicius, de, moraes, and, baden, powell, the, latter, two, signing, a, fertile, partnership, that, resulted, in, the, studio, album, os, afro, sambas, with, positive, international, impact, in, addition, to, bossa, nova, other, new, samba, sub, genres, emerged, in, this, period, between, the, late, 1950s, and, early, 1960s, the, rise, of, nightclubs, as, the, main, nightlife, venues, in, rio, disseminated, variety, shows, with, the, participation, of, sambistas, and, samba, dancers, mainly, performed, by, instrumental, musical, ensemble, with, keyboard, electric, guitar, acoustic, bass, guitar, drums, and, percussion, and, performed, by, crooners, a, trend, in, the, 1960s, live, music, in, brazil, this, format, of, samba, to, dance, resulted, in, styles, such, as, the, sambalan, o, a, very, lively, and, dancing, type, of, samba, from, which, musicians, such, as, ed, lincoln, and, performers, such, as, s, lvio, c, sar, pedrinho, rodrigues, orlandivo, miltinho, and, elza, soares, stood, out, in, this, same, environment, samba, jazz, also, emerged, consolidated, with, the, success, of, bossa, nova, that, brought, samba, and, bebop, closer, together, initially, based, on, the, piano, bass, drums, musical, ensemble, and, later, broader, formations, also, under, this, context, the, composer, jorge, ben, emerged, with, his, peculiar, and, hybrid, way, of, playing, samba, mixing, elements, of, bossa, nova, and, american, blues, and, rock, n, roll, that, would, even, take, samba, songs, such, as, mas, que, nada, and, chove, chuva, released, by, s, rgio, mendes, brazil, 66, to, the, billboard, charts, and, at, the, end, of, the, 1960s, samba, funk, emerged, led, by, pianist, dom, salvador, which, mixed, the, two, beats, to, the, bar, of, samba, and, the, four, beats, to, the, bar, of, american, funk, that, had, just, arrived, in, the, brazilian, music, market, at, that, time, the, period, was, also, characterized, by, the, profusion, of, some, partner, dance, samba, styles, these, were, the, cases, of, samba, de, gafieira, a, dance, style, developed, in, the, ballroom, dance, of, suburban, clubs, in, rio, de, janeiro, frequented, by, people, with, low, purchasing, power, throughout, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, and, which, also, became, a, fad, among, upper, middle, class, people, in, the, 1960s, and, the, samba, rock, a, dance, style, born, in, the, s, o, paulo, suburban, parties, in, the, 1960s, mixing, steps, from, samba, rock, and, caribbean, rhythms, such, as, rumba, and, salsa, the, bailes, blacks, black, balls, experienced, their, peak, notably, in, rio, and, s, o, paulo, in, the, 1970s, a, time, of, great, diffusion, of, the, american, black, music, in, brazil, which, were, frequently, disseminated, at, these, bailes, blacks, this, also, generated, a, new, debate, among, the, brazilian, music, critic, about, the, foreign, influence, on, brazilian, music, and, also, on, samba, itself, in, 1962, the, carta, do, samba, the, samba, letter, was, made, public, a, document, written, by, the, writer, dison, carneiro, that, expressed, the, need, to, preserve, traditional, features, of, samba, such, as, the, syncopa, without, however, denying, or, taking, away, spontaneity, and, prospects, for, progress, this, letter, came, to, meet, a, series, of, circumstances, that, made, traditional, urban, samba, not, only, revalued, in, different, brazilian, cultural, circles, but, also, started, to, be, considered, by, them, as, a, kind, of, counter, hegemonic, and, resistance, music, in, the, brazilian, music, scene, in, a, decade, characterized, in, the, brazilian, music, industry, by, the, domination, of, international, rock, music, and, its, brazilian, variant, jovem, guarda, the, traditional, samba, would, have, started, to, be, seen, as, an, expression, of, the, greatest, authenticity, and, purity, of, the, genre, which, led, to, the, creation, of, terms, such, as, samba, aut, ntico, authentic, samba, samba, de, morro, samba, of, the, hill, samba, de, raiz, roots, samba, or, samba, de, verdade, real, samba, one, of, the, major, expressions, of, this, resistance, samba, in, the, first, half, of, the, 1960s, was, zicartola, a, bar, opened, by, sambista, cartola, and, his, wife, dona, zica, in, 1963, which, transformed, in, a, short, time, at, a, famous, meeting, point, of, veteran, sambistas, attracted, the, attendance, of, many, left, wing, intellectuals, and, students, and, became, famous, for, its, samba, nights, that, in, addition, to, revealing, new, talents, such, as, paulinho, da, viola, revived, the, careers, of, former, composers, then, ostracized, from, the, music, industry, in, february, 1964, the, year, of, the, brazilian, military, coup, d, tat, it, was, released, the, nara, le, o, s, debut, album, which, included, sambas, by, traditional, samba, composers, such, as, cartola, elton, medeiros, nelson, cavaquinho, and, z, keti, as, well, as, samba, songs, from, the, bossa, nova, nationalist, branch, and, at, the, end, of, that, year, nara, le, o, met, with, z, keti, and, jo, o, do, vale, for, the, musical, show, opini, o, which, became, a, reference, as, an, artistic, manifestation, in, protest, to, the, authoritarian, regime, established, the, following, year, the, composer, herm, nio, bello, de, carvalho, produced, rosa, de, ouro, a, musical, that, launched, the, sixty, year, old, clementina, de, jesus, to, the, general, public, it, was, the, birth, of, the, professional, artistic, career, of, one, of, the, most, expressive, voices, in, the, samba, history, characterized, by, a, repertoire, aimed, at, the, african, music, matrixes, such, as, jongos, curimbas, lundus, and, sambas, of, the, rural, tradition, the, music, ensemble, to, accompany, clementina, in, this, show, was, composed, by, paulinho, da, viola, elton, medeiros, anescarzinho, do, salgueiro, jair, do, cavaquinho, and, nelson, sargento, known, at, the, time, as, regional, these, musical, ensemble, based, on, classical, guitar, cavaquinho, and, pandeiro, and, occasionally, some, wind, instrument, were, revalued, and, became, associated, with, the, idea, of, a, more, authentic, and, genuine, samba, from, then, on, the, idea, of, forming, samba, vocal, instrumental, groups, for, professional, presentations, matured, and, with, the, success, obtained, by, groups, such, as, a, voz, do, morro, and, os, cinco, crioulos, boosted, the, creation, of, other, groups, composed, only, by, sambistas, with, direct, or, indirect, ties, with, the, samba, schools, in, the, following, years, such, as, the, groups, os, originais, do, samba, nosso, samba, brazil, ritmo, 67, os, batuqueiros, exporta, samba, among, others, two, other, significant, performances, from, this, moment, of, aesthetic, revaluation, of, traditional, urban, samba, were, telecoteco, opus, n, 1, with, cyro, monteiro, and, dilermando, pinheiro, which, was, shown, at, teatro, opini, o, and, o, samba, pede, passagem, which, brought, together, veterans, ismael, silva, and, aracy, de, almeida, with, the, young, artists, baden, powell, sidney, miller, and, mpb4, among, others, in, this, context, of, the, effervescence, of, the, samba, resistance, movements, the, radio, show, adelzon, alves, o, amigo, da, madrugada, adelzon, alves, the, friend, of, the, dawn, has, appeared, presented, by, radio, broadcaster, adelzon, alves, on, r, dio, globo, in, rio, de, janeiro, the, radio, program, dedicated, a, repertoire, exclusively, dedicated, to, the, samba, in, a, scenario, in, which, radio, before, the, supremacy, of, television, as, a, major, means, of, communication, in, brazil, had, become, a, disseminator, of, music, recorded, on, disc, faced, with, the, hegemony, of, anglo, american, rock, and, jovem, guarda, especially, due, to, the, influence, of, record, labels, on, commercial, broadcasters, in, the, country, adelzon, alves, radio, show, became, the, main, spokesman, for, samba, and, sambistas, from, rio, de, janeiro, on, the, media, and, a, major, propagator, of, terms, which, reverberate, until, today, referring, to, the, legacy, of, the, universe, of, samba, do, morro, as, national, music, of, resistance, and, root, in, addition, to, the, strength, of, jovem, guarda, a, movement, catapulted, by, the, eponymous, program, shown, by, tv, record, brazilian, music, at, that, time, experienced, the, emergence, of, a, new, generation, of, post, bossa, nova, artists, who, reknowed, in, the, scope, of, the, brazilian, song, festivals, era, became, the, embryo, of, the, so, called, mpb, one, of, those, most, notable, names, was, the, composer, chico, buarque, author, of, sambas, such, as, apesar, de, voc, which, became, classics, of, the, genre, against, the, ideological, disputes, between, the, acoustic, guitar, an, instrument, traditional, in, brazilian, music, genres, and, synonymous, with, national, music, and, electric, guitars, seen, as, an, americanized, instrument, in, brazilian, music, that, characterized, these, brazilian, song, festivals, the, beginning, sambista, martinho, da, vila, entered, menina, mo, a, a, stylized, samba, de, partido, alto, in, the, third, festival, of, brazilian, popular, music, in, 1967, although, its, early, eliminated, in, this, contest, this, samba, projected, martinho, s, name, on, the, music, scene, of, that, time, whose, subsequent, successes, paved, the, way, for, the, affirmation, in, the, music, industry, of, this, type, of, samba, characterized, by, strong, chorus, and, normally, three, solo, parts, as, the, aesthetic, orientation, towards, young, music, of, that, time, these, song, festivals, practically, ignored, the, samba, which, generated, criticism, from, sambistas, such, as, elton, medeiros, who, claimed, the, inclusion, of, the, truly, brazilian, music, in, these, musical, contests, against, this, trend, the, first, bienal, do, samba, took, place, in, 1968, a, year, also, characterized, by, the, release, of, paulinho, da, viola, s, first, solo, album, and, also, of, another, studio, album, by, this, composer, in, a, duet, with, elton, medeiros, at, the, beginning, of, the, following, decade, paulinho, consolidated, his, prestige, with, the, commercial, success, of, the, samba, foi, um, rio, que, passou, na, minha, vida, and, also, as, a, producer, of, the, first, studio, album, of, the, velha, guarda, da, portela, samba, group, between, 1968, and, 1979, brazil, experienced, a, huge, growth, in, the, production, and, consumption, of, cultural, goods, during, this, period, there, was, a, strong, expansion, of, the, music, industry, in, the, country, which, consolidated, itself, as, one, of, the, largest, world, markets, among, the, main, factors, for, the, expansion, of, the, brazilian, market, were, the, consolidation, of, mpb, production, stimulated, by, artists, such, as, elis, regina, chico, buarque, caetano, veloso, gilberto, gil, gal, costa, maria, bethania, and, also, in, the, segment, of, sentimental, songs, drawn, sales, champion, roberto, carlos, the, establishment, of, lp, as, a, dominant, medium, format, where, it, was, possible, to, insert, several, compositions, on, the, same, record, and, also, made, the, artist, more, important, than, his, songs, individually, the, significant, participation, of, foreign, music, in, the, brazilian, market, with, the, predominance, of, young, music, on, the, country, charts, and, the, growth, of, the, international, repertoire, on, the, soap, opera, soundtracks, mainly, on, tv, globo, another, important, aspect, in, the, phonographic, sector, of, the, period, was, technological, with, a, modernization, of, recording, studios, in, brazil, that, approached, international, technical, standards, and, the, consolidation, of, foreign, record, labels, in, the, country, such, as, emi, and, the, wea, this, brazilian, entry, in, the, scope, of, the, global, cultural, industry, also, profoundly, affected, the, samba, universe, which, became, one, of, the, mass, phenomena, of, the, national, music, market, of, that, decade, represented, by, the, appearance, on, the, list, of, best, selling, records, of, the, period, of, studio, albums, by, artists, such, as, martinho, da, vila, originals, of, samba, agep, beth, carvalho, clara, nunes, alcione, jair, rodrigues, and, benito, de, paula, among, others, and, of, sambas, enredo, of, rio, samba, schools, in, the, stronghold, of, traditional, samba, the, first, lps, of, veteran, composers, donga, cartola, and, nelson, cavaquinho, were, released, two, other, composers, already, established, in, this, environment, candeia, and, dona, ivone, lara, also, debuted, with, solo, works, in, the, phonographic, market, the, same, happened, in, s, o, paulo, with, the, releases, of, the, first, adoniran, barbosa, and, paulo, vanzolini, studio, albums, revealed, in, the, previous, decade, the, sambistas, paulinho, da, viola, and, martinho, da, vila, consolidated, themselves, as, two, of, the, great, names, of, success, in, the, samba, in, the, 1970s, which, also, saw, the, emergence, of, singers, songwriters, roberto, ribeiro, and, jo, o, nogueira, among, the, singers, of, the, new, generation, the, names, of, clara, nunes, beth, carvalho, and, alcione, emerged, as, the, great, female, samba, singers, in, the, brazilian, music, industry, whose, good, record, sales, marked, by, the, appreciation, of, songs, by, the, composers, of, the, rio, de, janeiro, samba, schools, contributed, greatly, for, the, popularity, of, samba, in, addition, to, this, triad, of, singers, were, also, added, leci, brand, o, who, was, already, a, member, of, the, composer, wing, of, esta, o, primeira, de, mangueira, and, cristina, buarque, sister, of, chico, buarque, with, a, rescue, effort, for, samba, and, sambistas, from, samba, schools, among, the, new, composers, paulo, cesar, pinheiro, nei, lopes, wilson, moreira, stood, out, in, addition, to, the, duo, aldir, blanc, and, jo, o, bosco, under, this, same, context, of, the, expansion, of, samba, in, the, brazilian, phonographic, market, of, the, 1970s, the, music, industry, invested, in, a, less, traditional, and, more, sentimental, line, of, samba, whose, simplified, rhythmic, structure, left, percussion, the, main, feature, of, samba, a, little, sideways, rejected, as, tacky, and, kitsch, by, both, the, most, respected, musicians, in, the, country, and, by, critics, this, formula, was, stigmatized, under, the, derogatory, term, of, samb, o, joia, despite, this, this, most, romantic, samba, has, become, a, great, commercial, success, in, the, repertoire, of, singers, such, as, luiz, ayr, o, luiz, am, rico, gilson, de, souza, benito, di, paula, and, agep, as, well, as, the, duo, ant, nio, carlos, e, joc, fi, authors, of, the, world, famous, samba, voc, abusou, another, bet, of, the, phonographic, industry, of, the, time, was, partido, alto, collective, records, a, traditional, form, of, samba, that, is, often, sung, in, the, terreiros, the, samba, school, headquarters, in, rio, de, janeiro, and, in, the, usual, pagodes, festive, gatherings, with, music, food, and, drink, since, the, first, decades, of, the, 20th, century, with, remote, african, roots, this, sub, genre, is, characterized, by, a, highly, percussive, pandeiro, beat, using, the, palm, of, the, hand, in, the, center, of, the, instrument, for, snapping, a, greater, tone, harmony, usually, played, by, a, set, of, percussion, instruments, normally, surdo, pandeiro, and, tamborim, and, accompanied, by, a, cavaquinho, and, or, classical, guitar, and, the, art, of, singing, and, creating, improvised, verses, almost, always, in, the, character, of, challenge, or, contest, this, essence, based, on, improvisation, was, taken, to, the, record, studios, where, partido, alto, became, a, style, with, more, musicality, and, made, with, more, concise, verses, and, written, solos, instead, of, improvised, and, spontaneous, singing, according, to, traditional, canons, this, stylized, partido, alto, was, released, on, several, collective, lps, released, during, the, 1970s, whose, titles, included, the, subgenre, s, own, name, such, as, bambas, do, partido, alto, a, fina, flor, do, partido, alto, and, isto, que, partido, alto, which, included, samba, composers, such, as, an, zio, aniceto, candeia, casquinha, jo, ozinho, da, pecadora, luiz, grande, and, wilson, moreira, although, not, all, were, versed, in, the, art, of, improvisation, another, artist, who, stood, out, as, a, partideiro, was, bezerra, da, silva, a, singer, who, would, be, noteworthy, in, the, following, decade, with, sambas, similar, to, the, partido, alto, and, themed, in, the, world, and, in, the, underworld, of, rio, s, favelas, the, 1970s, were, also, a, time, of, major, changes, in, rio, de, janeiro, samba, schools, and, the, music, industry, began, to, invest, in, the, annual, production, of, lps, of, the, sambas, de, enredo, presented, at, the, carnival, parades, in, the, early, years, it, was, common, to, release, up, to, two, albums, the, first, containing, the, sambas, enredo, of, the, parades, and, the, second, with, sambas, depicting, the, history, of, each, samba, school, beginning, in, 1974, the, annual, release, began, to, focus, on, a, single, lp, for, each, first, and, second, division, of, rio, carnival, parades, even, during, this, period, rodas, de, samba, samba, circles, began, to, spread, as, a, fever, throughout, rio, de, janeiro, and, other, brazilian, cities, originally, restricted, to, the, backyards, of, sambistas, residences, and, the, samba, school, headquarters, these, informal, meetings, have, taken, on, a, new, meaning, in, clubs, theaters, steakhouses, among, others, with, the, promotion, of, rodas, de, samba, with, stage, and, microphones, and, the, participation, of, sambistas, linked, to, samba, schools, meanwhile, new, rodas, de, samba, were, formed, informally, in, the, suburbs, of, rio, de, janeiro, the, result, of, which, would, lead, to, the, germ, in, the, late, 1970s, of, a, new, and, successful, sub, genre, of, modern, samba, in, the, 1980s, originally, designated, in, the, samba, universe, for, the, musical, meetings, of, sambistas, and, soon, also, extending, to, the, sambas, sung, in, them, the, term, pagode, became, popular, with, the, resignification, of, the, rodas, de, samba, in, rio, de, janeiro, from, the, 1970s, with, the, pagodes, or, pagodes, de, mesa, pagode, circles, where, sambistas, gathered, around, a, large, table, often, located, in, a, residential, backyard, in, opposition, to, the, fashionable, samba, circles, made, in, clubs, and, the, like, some, of, the, most, famous, pagodes, in, the, city, were, the, pagode, of, clube, do, samba, made, at, jo, o, nogueira, s, residence, in, m, ier, terreir, o, da, tia, doca, with, the, rehearsals, of, the, portela, old, guard, sambists, in, oswaldo, cruz, of, pagode, of, arlindinho, organized, by, arlindo, cruz, em, cascadura, and, mainly, the, pagode, of, the, carnival, block, cacique, de, ramos, in, the, suburban, area, of, leopoldina, in, the, 1980s, pagodes, became, a, fever, throughout, rio, de, janeiro, and, far, beyond, simple, places, of, entertainment, they, became, radiating, centers, of, a, new, musical, language, that, expressed, itself, with, a, new, interpretive, and, totally, renewed, style, of, samba, that, was, embedded, in, the, tradition, of, the, partido, alto, among, the, innovations, of, this, new, samba, and, marked, by, refinement, in, melodies, and, innovations, in, harmony, and, percussion, with, the, accompaniment, of, instruments, such, as, tan, tan, in, place, of, the, surdo, the, hand, repique, and, the, four, string, banjo, with, cavaquinho, tuning, the, debut, of, this, kind, of, samba, in, the, recording, studios, occurred, in, 1980, with, fundo, de, quintal, musical, group, sponsored, by, beth, carvalho, in, its, first, works, fundo, de, quintal, gave, visibility, not, only, to, this, new, samba, but, also, to, composers, such, as, almir, guineto, arlindo, cruz, jorge, arag, o, all, members, of, the, group, and, luiz, carlos, da, vila, this, one, linked, to, the, cacique, de, ramos, pagodes, on, this, way, opened, by, fundo, de, quintal, in, 1985, the, collective, studio, album, called, ra, a, brasileira, was, released, which, revealed, to, the, general, public, singers, such, as, jovelina, p, rola, negra, and, zeca, pagodinho, especially, prioritizing, partido, alto, sambas, this, lp, as, well, as, the, works, since, 1979, by, beth, carvalho, almir, guineto, and, the, group, fundo, de, quintal, formed, the, new, sub, genre, that, ended, up, being, called, pagode, by, the, brazilian, music, industry, the, novelty, of, the, pagode, in, the, brazilian, music, scene, occurred, at, a, time, of, major, reorganization, of, the, music, industry, in, the, country, whose, investments, in, the, first, half, of, the, 1980s, had, been, concentrated, mainly, on, brazilian, rock, and, children, s, music, although, some, samba, artists, had, some, commercial, success, in, the, period, such, as, bezerra, da, silva, almir, guineto, and, agep, who, in, 1984, became, the, first, samba, singer, to, surpass, the, mark, of, 1, million, copies, sold, on, a, single, lp, the, moment, was, not, promising, for, samba, in, the, commercial, scope, very, popular, performers, like, beth, carvalho, clara, nunes, jo, o, nogueira, and, roberto, ribeiro, pulled, the, drop, in, sales, of, records, of, the, genre, disgusted, by, the, little, recognition, and, interest, in, promoting, his, work, paulinho, da, viola, left, the, warner, music, label, in, 1984, and, only, returned, to, having, an, album, released, at, the, end, of, that, decade, with, the, success, of, the, lp, ra, a, brasileira, the, pagode, phenomenon, experienced, a, period, of, commercial, growth, in, the, brazilian, phonographic, market, the, main, artists, in, this, sub, genre, reached, the, top, of, the, success, charts, and, became, known, nationally, thanks, to, exposure, in, the, mainstream, media, and, the, growing, investments, of, record, labels, stimulated, by, huge, sales, since, 1986, pulled, by, both, the, lps, of, the, already, established, almir, guineto, and, fundo, de, quintal, the, great, paradigm, of, the, subgenre, and, for, the, debut, works, of, zeca, pagodinho, marquinhos, sat, and, jovelina, p, rola, negra, although, there, was, a, certain, cooling, of, the, interest, of, record, labels, and, the, media, even, during, the, second, half, of, the, 1980s, pagode, established, itself, as, an, important, subgenre, of, samba, in, the, 1990s, a, new, generation, of, artists, emerged, who, shared, to, some, extent, similar, characteristics, such, as, the, incorporation, of, musical, elements, traditionally, uncommon, in, the, traditional, samba, and, a, repertoire, devoted, largely, to, romantic, lyrics, initially, seen, by, the, phonographic, industry, and, by, the, media, as, a, continuation, of, the, pagode, of, the, previous, decade, this, new, wave, was, later, characterized, under, the, label, of, pagode, rom, ntico, romantic, pagode, or, also, pagode, paulista, due, to, the, large, number, of, artists, of, this, scene, that, emerged, mainly, from, s, o, paulo, state, although, there, were, also, names, from, minas, gerais, and, rio, de, janeiro, states, this, distinction, was, established, precisely, because, the, samba, made, by, these, new, artists, and, musical, groups, although, it, maintained, some, similarities, with, the, standard, enshrined, in, the, fundo, de, quintal, did, not, have, the, samba, musicians, of, the, previous, decade, as, a, major, musical, reference, nor, did, it, keep, traditional, and, informal, aspects, of, matrixes, of, urban, samba, for, example, the, studio, recordings, of, a, large, part, of, these, samba, bands, such, as, ra, a, negra, gave, up, the, use, of, instruments, common, to, the, 1980s, pagode, such, as, hand, repique, tan, tan, and, banjo, in, exchange, for, instrumentation, characteristic, of, international, pop, music, from, that, period, especially, the, saxophone, and, the, electronic, keyboard, the, use, of, these, pop, music, instruments, was, less, or, more, common, to, each, group, but, their, purpose, was, the, same, that, is, the, use, of, samplers, and, keyboards, to, reproduce, the, sound, of, various, instruments, despite, these, dilutions, the, romantic, pagode, achieved, great, commercial, success, in, the, brazilian, phonographic, market, and, in, the, mass, media, highlighting, samba, groups, such, as, art, popular, negritude, j, nior, exaltasamba, katinguel, ra, a, negra, s, pra, contrariar, soweto, among, others, during, the, second, half, of, the, 1990s, the, increase, in, the, illegal, sale, of, cassette, tapes, and, mainly, compact, discs, caused, a, deep, crisis, in, the, music, industry, in, brazil, which, worsened, from, the, 2000s, with, the, possibility, of, digital, download, often, free, of, charge, of, musical, works, via, the, internet, in, this, context, there, was, a, sharp, drop, in, the, commercialization, of, official, samba, records, and, their, sub, genres, especially, pagode, samba, groups, of, huge, commercial, success, in, the, 1990s, such, as, ra, a, negra, and, s, pra, contrariar, saw, their, sales, drop, substantially, at, the, turn, of, the, 21st, century, in, addition, in, a, space, of, a, few, decades, samba, songs, played, in, the, media, have, declined, with, the, genre, it, is, almost, always, represented, by, the, sub, genre, pagode, in, the, brazilian, charts, of, the, 100, most, heard, artists, on, brazilian, radio, between, 2010, and, 2019, on, the, crowley, official, broadcast, chart, only, 11, were, from, samba, and, all, from, pagode, in, another, survey, carried, out, jointly, between, kantar, ibope, media, and, crowley, broadcast, analysis, the, pagode, corresponded, to, only, 9, of, the, radio, audience, in, brazil, in, 2019, too, far, from, the, dominant, sertanejo, brazilian, country, music, genre, whose, slice, represented, about, one, third, of, the, radio, audience, in, the, country, even, so, the, first, two, decades, of, the, 21st, century, confirmed, the, pagode, as, the, hegemonic, reference, of, samba, in, the, brazilian, music, industry, in, the, first, decade, of, this, century, new, artists, emerged, commercially, such, as, the, samba, bands, grupo, revela, o, sorriso, maroto, and, turma, do, pagode, and, some, singers, who, left, their, original, samba, groups, to, launch, a, solo, career, such, as, p, ricles, former, exaltasamba, belo, former, soweto, and, alexandre, pires, former, s, pra, contrariar, in, the, following, decade, it, was, the, turn, of, xande, de, pilares, and, thiaguinho, former, vocalists, of, revela, o, and, exaltasamba, respectively, and, of, singers, mumuzinho, ferrugem, and, dilsinho, a, characteristic, common, to, all, these, artists, was, the, significant, amount, of, live, album, releases, instead, of, traditional, studio, albums, this, gained, even, more, strength, with, the, development, of, streaming, media, a, platform, for, digital, music, that, became, popular, in, the, 2010s, outside, the, hegemonic, commercial, scope, of, the, subgenre, pagode, the, late, 1990s, was, also, a, period, of, great, visibility, and, notoriety, for, the, most, traditional, samba, in, rio, de, janeiro, a, new, generation, of, musicians, emerged, in, rodas, de, samba, that, spread, through, several, neighborhoods, in, the, city, especially, in, lapa, the, central, region, of, the, city, that, started, to, concentrate, several, bars, and, restaurants, with, live, music, for, having, identified, with, the, bohemian, neighborhood, this, movement, became, known, informally, as, samba, da, lapa, with, a, repertoire, composed, of, classics, sambas, and, without, concessions, to, more, modern, sub, genres, this, new, circuit, promoted, the, meeting, between, beginning, and, veteran, musicians, from, several, generations, of, sambistas, all, identified, with, the, traditional, elements, that, make, up, the, urban, carioca, samba, among, some, artists, who, acted, in, the, scope, of, samba, circles, in, this, neighborhood, were, teresa, cristina, and, semente, group, nilze, carvalho, and, sururu, na, roda, group, luciane, menezes, and, dobrando, a, esquina, group, eduardo, gallotti, and, anjos, da, lua, group, among, others, besides, veterans, such, as, urea, martins, and, later, edu, krieger, and, moyseis, marques, has, appeared, other, new, artists, linked, to, the, samba, traditions, but, without, direct, ties, to, the, lapa, carioca, movement, emerged, such, as, dudu, nobre, and, diogo, nogueira, in, addition, to, fabiana, cozza, in, s, o, paulo, in, the, institutional, field, the, brazilian, national, institute, of, historic, and, artistic, heritage, declared, in, 2007, the, modern, carioca, samba, and, its, matrixes, samba, de, terreiro, partido, alto, and, samba, enredo, as, intangible, cultural, heritage, in, brazil, with, basically, 2, 4, rhythm, and,
