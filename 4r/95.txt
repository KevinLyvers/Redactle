a, legend, is, a, genre, of, folklore, that, consists, of, a, narrative, featuring, human, actions, believed, or, perceived, to, have, taken, place, in, human, history, narratives, in, this, genre, may, demonstrate, human, values, and, possess, certain, qualities, that, give, the, tale, verisimilitude, legend, for, its, active, and, passive, participants, may, include, miracles, legends, may, be, transformed, over, time, to, keep, them, fresh, and, vital, many, legends, operate, within, the, realm, of, uncertainty, never, being, entirely, believed, by, the, participants, but, also, never, being, resolutely, doubted, legends, are, sometimes, distinguished, from, myths, in, that, they, concern, human, beings, as, the, main, characters, and, do, not, necessarily, have, supernatural, origins, and, sometimes, in, that, they, have, some, sort, of, historical, basis, whereas, myths, generally, do, not, the, brothers, grimm, defined, legend, as, folktale, historically, grounded, a, by, product, of, the, concern, with, human, beings, is, the, long, list, of, legendary, creatures, leaving, no, resolute, doubt, that, legends, are, historically, grounded, a, modern, folklorist, s, professional, definition, of, legend, was, proposed, by, timothy, r, tangherlini, in, 1990, legend, typically, is, a, short, mono, episodic, traditional, highly, ecotypified, historicized, narrative, performed, in, a, conversational, mode, reflecting, on, a, psychological, level, a, symbolic, representation, of, folk, belief, and, collective, experiences, and, serving, as, a, reaffirmation, of, commonly, held, values, of, the, group, to, whose, tradition, it, belongs, legend, is, a, loanword, from, old, french, that, entered, english, usage, c, 1340, the, old, french, noun, legende, derives, from, the, medieval, latin, legenda, in, its, early, english, language, usage, the, word, indicated, a, narrative, of, an, event, the, word, legendary, was, originally, a, noun, introduced, in, the, 1510s, meaning, a, collection, or, corpus, of, legends, this, word, changed, to, legendry, and, legendary, became, the, adjectival, form, by, 1613, english, speaking, protestants, began, to, use, the, word, when, they, wished, to, imply, that, an, event, especially, the, story, of, any, saint, not, acknowledged, in, john, foxe, s, actes, and, monuments, was, fictitious, thus, legend, gained, its, modern, connotations, of, undocumented, and, spurious, which, distinguish, it, from, the, meaning, of, chronicle, in, 1866, jacob, grimm, described, the, fairy, tale, as, poetic, legend, historic, early, scholars, such, as, karl, wehrhan, friedrich, ranke, and, will, erich, peuckert, followed, grimm, s, example, in, focussing, solely, on, the, literary, narrative, an, approach, that, was, enriched, particularly, after, the, 1960s, by, addressing, questions, of, performance, and, the, anthropological, and, psychological, insights, provided, in, considering, legends, social, context, questions, of, categorising, legends, in, hopes, of, compiling, a, content, based, series, of, categories, on, the, line, of, the, aarne, thompson, folktale, index, provoked, a, search, for, a, broader, new, synthesis, in, an, early, attempt, at, defining, some, basic, questions, operative, in, examining, folk, tales, friedrich, ranke, in, 1925, characterised, the, folk, legend, as, a, popular, narrative, with, an, objectively, untrue, imaginary, content, a, dismissive, position, that, was, subsequently, largely, abandoned, compared, to, the, highly, structured, folktale, legend, is, comparatively, amorphous, helmut, de, boor, noted, in, 1928, the, narrative, content, of, legend, is, in, realistic, mode, rather, than, the, wry, irony, of, folktale, wilhelm, heiske, remarked, on, the, similarity, of, motifs, in, legend, and, folktale, and, concluded, that, in, spite, of, its, realistic, mode, legend, is, not, more, historical, than, folktale, in, einleitung, in, der, geschichtswissenschaft, 1928, ernst, bernheim, asserted, that, a, legend, is, simply, a, longstanding, rumour, gordon, allport, credited, the, staying, power, of, some, rumours, to, the, persistent, cultural, state, of, mind, that, they, embody, and, capsulise, thus, urban, legends, are, a, feature, of, rumour, when, willian, hugh, jansen, suggested, that, legends, that, disappear, quickly, were, short, term, legends, and, the, persistent, ones, be, termed, long, term, legends, the, distinction, between, legend, and, rumour, was, effectively, obliterated, tangherlini, concluded, in, a, narrow, christian, sense, legenda, things, to, be, read, were, hagiographical, accounts, often, collected, in, a, legendary, because, saints, lives, are, often, included, in, many, miracle, stories, legend, in, a, wider, sense, came, to, refer, to, any, story, that, is, set, in, a, historical, context, but, that, contains, supernatural, divine, or, fantastic, elements, history, preserved, orally, through, many, generations, often, takes, on, a, more, narrative, based, or, mythological, form, over, time, an, example, being, the, oral, traditions, of, the, african, great, lakes, hippolyte, delehaye, distinguished, legend, from, myth, the, legend, on, the, other, hand, has, of, necessity, some, historical, or, topographical, connection, it, refers, imaginary, events, to, some, real, personage, or, it, localizes, romantic, stories, in, some, definite, spot, from, the, moment, a, legend, is, retold, as, fiction, its, authentic, legendary, qualities, begin, to, fade, and, recede, in, the, legend, of, sleepy, hollow, washington, irving, transformed, a, local, hudson, river, valley, legend, into, a, literary, anecdote, with, gothic, overtones, which, actually, tended, to, diminish, its, character, as, genuine, legend, stories, that, exceed, the, boundaries, of, realism, are, called, fables, for, example, the, talking, animal, formula, of, aesop, identifies, his, brief, stories, as, fables, not, legends, the, parable, of, the, prodigal, son, would, be, a, legend, if, it, were, told, as, having, actually, happened, to, a, specific, son, of, a, historical, father, if, it, included, a, donkey, that, gave, sage, advice, to, the, prodigal, son, it, would, be, a, fable, legend, may, be, transmitted, orally, passed, on, person, to, person, or, in, the, original, sense, through, written, text, jacobus, de, voragine, s, legenda, aurea, or, the, golden, legend, comprises, a, series, of, vitae, or, instructive, biographical, narratives, tied, to, the, liturgical, calendar, of, the, roman, catholic, church, they, are, presented, as, lives, of, the, saints, but, the, profusion, of, miraculous, happenings, and, above, all, their, uncritical, context, are, characteristics, of, hagiography, the, legenda, was, intended, to, inspire, extemporized, homilies, and, sermons, appropriate, to, the, saint, of, the, day, urban, legends, are, a, modern, genre, of, folklore, that, is, rooted, in, local, popular, culture, usually, comprising, fictional, stories, that, are, often, presented, as, true, with, macabre, or, humorous, elements, these, legends, can, be, used, for, entertainment, purposes, as, well, as, semi, serious, explanations, for, seemingly, mysterious, events, such, as, disappearances, and, strange, objects, the, term, urban, legend, as, generally, used, by, folklorists, has, appeared, in, print, since, at, least, 1968, jan, harold, brunvand, professor, of, english, at, the, university, of, utah, introduced, the, term, to, the, general, public, in, a, series, of, popular, books, published, beginning, in, 1981, brunvand, used, his, collection, of, legends, the, vanishing, hitchhiker, american, urban, legends, their, meanings, 1981, to, make, two, points, first, that, legends, and, folklore, do, not, occur, exclusively, in, so, called, primitive, or, traditional, societies, and, second, that, one, could, learn, much, about, urban, and, modern, culture, by, studying, such, tales
