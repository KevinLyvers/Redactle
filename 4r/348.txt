plucked, woodwind, instruments, are, a, family, of, musical, instruments, within, the, greater, category, of, wind, instruments, common, examples, include, flute, clarinet, oboe, bassoon, and, saxophone, there, are, two, main, types, of, woodwind, instruments, flutes, and, reed, instruments, otherwise, called, reed, pipes, the, main, distinction, between, these, instruments, and, other, wind, instruments, is, the, way, in, which, they, produce, sound, all, woodwinds, produce, sound, by, splitting, the, air, blown, into, them, on, a, sharp, edge, such, as, a, reed, or, a, fipple, despite, the, name, a, woodwind, may, be, made, of, any, material, not, just, wood, common, examples, of, other, materials, include, brass, silver, cane, and, other, metals, such, as, gold, and, platinum, the, saxophone, for, example, though, made, of, brass, is, considered, a, woodwind, because, it, requires, a, reed, to, produce, sound, occasionally, woodwinds, are, made, of, earthen, materials, especially, ocarinas, flutes, produce, sound, by, directing, a, focused, stream, of, air, across, the, edge, of, a, hole, in, a, cylindrical, tube, the, flute, family, can, be, divided, into, two, subfamilies, open, flutes, and, closed, flutes, to, produce, a, sound, with, an, open, flute, the, player, is, required, to, blow, a, stream, of, air, across, a, sharp, edge, that, then, splits, the, airstream, this, split, air, stream, then, acts, upon, the, air, column, contained, within, the, flute, s, hollow, causing, it, to, vibrate, and, produce, sound, examples, of, open, flutes, are, the, transverse, flute, panpipes, and, shakuhachi, ancient, flutes, of, this, variety, including, bamboo, flutes, were, often, made, from, tubular, sections, of, plants, such, as, grasses, reeds, bamboo, and, hollowed, out, tree, branches, later, flutes, were, made, of, metals, such, as, tin, copper, or, bronze, modern, concert, flutes, are, usually, made, of, high, grade, metal, alloys, usually, containing, nickel, silver, copper, or, gold, to, produce, a, sound, with, a, closed, flute, the, player, is, required, to, blow, air, into, a, duct, this, duct, acts, as, a, channel, bringing, the, air, to, a, sharp, edge, as, with, the, open, flutes, the, air, is, then, split, this, causes, the, column, of, air, within, the, closed, flute, to, vibrate, and, produce, sound, examples, of, this, type, of, flute, include, the, recorder, ocarina, and, organ, pipes, reed, instruments, produce, sound, by, focusing, air, into, a, mouthpiece, which, then, causes, a, reed, or, reeds, to, vibrate, similarly, to, flutes, reed, pipes, are, also, further, divided, into, two, types, single, reed, and, double, reed, single, reed, woodwinds, produce, sound, by, fixing, a, reed, onto, the, opening, of, a, mouthpiece, using, a, ligature, when, air, is, forced, between, the, reed, and, the, mouthpiece, the, reed, causes, the, air, column, in, the, instrument, to, vibrate, and, produce, its, unique, sound, single, reed, instruments, include, the, clarinet, and, saxophone, double, reed, instruments, use, two, precisely, cut, small, pieces, of, cane, bound, together, at, the, base, this, form, of, sound, production, has, been, estimated, to, have, originated, in, the, middle, to, late, neolithic, period, its, discovery, has, been, attributed, to, the, observation, of, wind, blowing, through, a, split, rush, the, finished, bound, reed, is, inserted, into, the, instrument, and, vibrates, as, air, is, forced, between, the, two, pieces, again, causing, the, air, within, the, instrument, to, vibrate, as, well, this, family, of, reed, pipes, is, subdivided, further, into, another, two, subfamilies, exposed, double, reed, and, capped, double, reed, instruments, exposed, double, reed, instruments, are, played, by, having, the, double, reed, directly, between, the, player, s, lips, this, family, includes, instruments, such, as, the, oboe, cor, anglais, also, called, english, horn, and, bassoon, and, many, types, of, shawms, throughout, the, world, capped, double, reed, instruments, on, the, other, hand, have, the, double, reed, covered, by, a, cap, the, player, blows, through, a, hole, in, this, cap, that, then, directs, the, air, through, the, reeds, this, family, includes, the, crumhorn, bagpipes, are, unique, reed, pipe, instruments, since, they, use, two, or, more, double, or, single, reeds, however, bagpipes, are, functionally, the, same, as, a, capped, double, reed, instruments, since, the, reeds, are, never, in, direct, contact, with, the, player, s, lips, free, reed, aerophone, instruments, are, likewise, unique, since, sound, is, produced, by, free, reeds, small, metal, tongues, arranged, in, rows, within, a, metal, or, wooden, frame, the, airflow, necessary, for, the, instrument, s, sound, is, generated, either, by, a, player, s, breath, e, g, harmonica, or, by, bellows, e, g, accordion, the, modern, orchestra, s, woodwind, section, typically, includes, flutes, oboes, clarinets, and, bassoons, supplementary, instruments, include, piccolo, cor, anglais, bass, clarinet, e, flat, clarinet, and, contrabassoon, saxophones, are, also, used, on, occasion, the, concert, band, s, woodwind, section, is, typically, much, larger, and, more, diverse, than, the, orchestra, s, it, typically, includes, piccolos, flutes, oboes, b, clarinets, bass, clarinets, bassoons, alto, saxophones, tenor, saxophones, and, baritone, saxophones, alto, flute, cor, anglais, e, clarinet, alto, clarinet, contra, alto, clarinet, contrabass, clarinet, contrabassoon, soprano, saxophone, and, bass, saxophone, are, also, sometimes, used
