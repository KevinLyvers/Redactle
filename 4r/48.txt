mazarin, continued, louis, xiii, s, unpopular, monetary, practices, this, led, to, the, fronde, a, series, of, revolts, against, royal, authority, from, 1648, to, 1653, that, masked, a, struggle, between, mazarin, and, the, princes, of, the, blood, louis, xiv, s, extended, family, for, influence, over, him, in, the, aftermath, of, the, fronde, louis, xiv, became, determined, to, rule, alone,

the, ch, teau, de, vaux, le, vicomte, louis, xiv, was, impressed, by, the, ch, teau, and, its, gardens, which, were, the, work, of, louis, le, vau, the, court, architect, since, 1654, andr, le, n, tre, the, royal, gardener, since, 1657, and, charles, le, brun, a, painter, in, royal, service, since, 1647, vaux, le, vicomte, s, scale, and, opulence, led, him, to, imprison, fouquet, that, september, as, he, had, also, built, an, island, fortress, and, a, private, army, but, louis, xiv, was, also, inspired, by, vaux, le, vicomte, and, he, recruited, its, authors, for, his, own, projects, louis, xiv, replaced, fouquet, with, jean, baptiste, colbert, a, prot, g, of, mazarin, and, enemy, of, fouquet, and, charged, him, with, managing, the, corps, of, artisans, in, royal, employment, colbert, acted, as, the, intermediary, between, them, and, louis, xiv, who, personally, directed, and, inspected, the, planning, and, construction, of, versailles, work, at, versailles, was, at, first, concentrated, on, gardens, and, through, the, 1660s, le, vau, only, added, two, detached, service, wings, and, a, forecourt, to, the, ch, teau, but, in, 1668, 69, as, a, response, to, the, growth, of, the, gardens, and, victory, over, spain, in, the, war, of, devolution, louis, xiv, decided, to, turn, versailles, into, a, full, scale, royal, residence, he, vacillated, between, replacing, or, incorporating, his, father, s, ch, teau, but, settled, on, the, latter, by, the, end, of, the, decade, and, from, 1668, to, 1671, louis, xiii, s, ch, teau, was, encased, on, three, sides, in, a, feature, dubbed, the, enveloppe, this, gave, the, ch, teau, a, new, italianate, fa, ade, overlooking, the, gardens, but, preserved, the, courtyard, fa, ade, resulting, in, a, mix, of, styles, and, materials, that, dismayed, louis, xiv, and, that, colbert, described, as, a, patchwork, attempts, to, homogenize, the, two, fa, ades, failed, and, in, 1670, le, vau, died, leaving, the, post, of, first, architect, to, the, king, vacant, for, the, next, seven, years, le, vau, was, succeeded, at, versailles, by, his, assistant, architect, fran, ois, d, orbay, work, at, the, palace, during, the, 1670s, focused, on, its, interiors, as, the, palace, was, then, nearing, completion, though, d, orbay, expanded, le, vau, s, service, wings, and, connected, them, to, the, ch, teau, and, built, a, pair, of, pavilions, for, government, employees, in, the, forecourt, in, 1670, d, orbay, was, tasked, by, louis, xiv, with, designing, a, city, also, called, versailles, to, house, and, service, louis, xiv, s, growing, government, and, court, the, granting, of, land, to, courtiers, for, the, construction, of, townhouses, that, resembled, the, palace, began, in, 1671, the, next, year, the, franco, dutch, war, began, and, funding, for, versailles, was, cut, until, 1674, when, louis, xiv, had, work, begun, on, the, ambassadors, staircase, a, grand, staircase, for, the, reception, of, guests, and, demolished, the, last, of, the, village, of, versailles, following, the, end, of, the, franco, dutch, war, with, french, victory, in, 1678, louis, xiv, appointed, as, first, architect, jules, hardouin, mansart, an, experienced, architect, in, louis, xiv, s, confidence, who, would, benefit, from, a, restored, budget, and, large, workforce, of, former, soldiers, mansart, began, his, tenure, with, the, addition, from, 1678, to, 1681, of, the, hall, of, mirrors, a, renovation, of, the, courtyard, fa, ade, of, louis, xiii, s, ch, teau, and, the, expansion, of, d, orbay, s, pavilions, to, create, the, ministers, wings, in, 1678, 79, adjacent, to, the, palace, hardouin, mansart, built, a, pair, of, stables, called, the, grande, and, petite, curies, from, 1679, to, 1682, and, the, grand, commun, which, housed, the, palace, s, servants, and, general, kitchens, from, 1682, to, 1684, hardouin, mansart, also, added, two, entirely, new, wings, in, le, vau, s, italianate, style, to, house, the, court, first, at, the, south, end, of, the, palace, from, 1679, to, 1681, and, then, at, its, north, end, from, 1685, to, 1689, war, and, the, resulting, diminished, funding, slowed, construction, at, versailles, for, the, rest, of, the, 17th, century, the, nine, years, war, which, began, in, 1688, stopped, work, altogether, until, 1698, three, years, later, however, the, even, more, expensive, war, of, the, spanish, succession, began, and, combined, with, poor, harvests, in, 1693, 94, and, 1709, 10, plunged, france, into, crisis, louis, xiv, thus, slashed, funding, and, cancelled, some, of, the, work, hardouin, mansart, had, planned, in, the, 1680s, such, as, the, remodelling, of, the, courtyard, fa, ade, in, the, italianate, style, louis, xiv, and, hardouin, mansart, focused, on, a, permanent, palace, chapel, the, construction, of, which, lasted, from, 1699, to, 1710, louis, xiv, s, successors, louis, xv, and, louis, xvi, largely, left, versailles, as, they, inherited, it, and, focused, on, the, palace, s, interiors, louis, xv, s, modifications, began, in, the, 1730s, with, the, completion, of, the, salon, d, hercule, a, ballroom, in, the, north, wing, and, the, expansion, of, the, king, s, private, apartment, which, required, the, demolition, of, the, ambassadors, staircase, in, 1748, louis, xv, began, construction, of, a, palace, theatre, the, royal, opera, of, versailles, at, the, northernmost, end, of, the, palace, but, completion, was, delayed, until, 1770, construction, was, interrupted, in, the, 1740s, by, the, war, of, the, austrian, succession, and, then, again, in, 1756, with, the, start, of, the, seven, years, war, these, wars, emptied, the, royal, treasury, and, thereafter, construction, was, mostly, funded, by, madame, du, barry, louis, xv, s, favourite, mistress, in, 1771, louis, xv, had, the, northern, ministers, wing, rebuilt, in, neoclassical, style, by, ange, jacques, gabriel, his, court, architect, as, it, was, in, the, process, of, falling, down, that, work, was, also, stopped, by, financial, constraints, and, it, remained, incomplete, when, louis, xv, died, in, 1774, in, 1784, louis, xvi, briefly, moved, the, royal, family, to, the, ch, teau, de, saint, cloud, ahead, of, more, renovations, to, the, palace, of, versailles, but, construction, could, not, begin, because, of, financial, difficulty, and, political, crisis, in, 1789, the, french, revolution, swept, the, royal, family, and, government, out, of, versailles, forever, the, palace, of, versailles, was, key, to, louis, xiv, s, politics, as, an, expression, and, concentration, of, french, art, and, culture, and, for, the, centralization, of, royal, power, louis, xiv, first, used, versailles, to, promote, himself, with, a, series, of, nighttime, festivals, in, its, gardens, in, 1664, 1668, and, 1674, the, events, of, which, were, disseminated, throughout, europe, by, print, and, engravings, as, early, as, 1669, but, especially, from, 1678, louis, xiv, sought, to, make, versailles, his, seat, of, government, and, he, expanded, the, palace, so, as, to, fit, the, court, within, it, the, moving, of, the, court, to, versailles, did, not, come, until, 1682, however, and, not, officially, as, opinion, on, versailles, was, mixed, among, the, nobility, of, france, by, 1687, however, it, was, evident, to, all, that, versailles, was, the, de, facto, capital, of, france, and, louis, xiv, succeeded, in, attracting, the, nobility, to, versailles, to, pursue, prestige, and, royal, patronage, within, a, strict, court, etiquette, thus, eroding, their, traditional, provincial, power, bases, it, was, at, the, palace, of, versailles, that, louis, xiv, received, the, doge, of, genoa, francesco, maria, imperiale, lercari, in, 1685, an, embassy, from, the, ayutthaya, kingdom, in, 1686, and, an, embassy, from, safavid, iran, in, 1715, louis, xiv, died, at, versailles, on, 1, september, 1715, and, was, succeeded, by, his, five, year, old, great, grandson, louis, xv, then, the, duke, of, anjou, who, was, moved, to, the, ch, teau, de, vincennes, and, then, to, paris, by, louis, xv, s, regent, philippe, ii, duke, of, orl, ans, versailles, was, neglected, until, 1722, when, philippe, ii, removed, the, court, to, versailles, to, escape, the, unpopularity, of, his, regency, and, when, louis, xv, began, his, majority, the, 1715, move, however, broke, the, cultural, power, of, versailles, and, during, the, reign, of, louis, xvi, courtiers, spent, their, leisure, in, paris, not, versailles, during, christmas, 1763, mozart, and, his, family, visited, versailles, and, dined, with, the, king, the, 7, year, old, wolfgang, amadeus, mozart, played, several, works, during, his, stay, and, later, dedicated, his, first,
