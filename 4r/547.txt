linear, or, point, projection, perspective, from, latin, perspicere, to, see, through, is, one, of, two, types, of, graphical, projection, perspective, in, the, graphic, arts, the, other, is, parallel, projection, linear, perspective, is, an, approximate, representation, generally, on, a, flat, surface, of, an, image, as, it, is, seen, by, the, eye, perspective, drawing, is, useful, for, representing, a, three, dimensional, scene, in, a, two, dimensional, medium, like, paper, it, is, based, on, the, optical, fact, that, for, a, person, an, object, looks, n, times, linearly, smaller, if, it, has, been, moved, n, times, further, from, the, eye, than, the, original, distance, was, the, most, characteristic, features, of, linear, perspective, are, that, objects, appear, smaller, as, their, distance, from, the, observer, increases, and, that, they, are, subject, to, foreshortening, meaning, that, an, object, s, dimensions, parallel, to, the, line, of, sight, appear, shorter, than, its, dimensions, perpendicular, to, the, line, of, sight, all, objects, will, recede, to, points, in, the, distance, usually, along, the, horizon, line, but, also, above, and, below, the, horizon, line, depending, on, the, view, used, italian, renaissance, painters, and, architects, including, filippo, brunelleschi, leon, battista, alberti, masaccio, paolo, uccello, piero, della, francesca, and, luca, pacioli, studied, linear, perspective, wrote, treatises, on, it, and, incorporated, it, into, their, artworks, perspective, works, by, representing, the, light, that, passes, from, a, scene, through, an, imaginary, rectangle, the, picture, plane, to, the, viewer, s, eye, as, if, a, viewer, were, looking, through, a, window, and, painting, what, is, seen, directly, onto, the, windowpane, if, viewed, from, the, same, spot, as, the, windowpane, was, painted, the, painted, image, would, be, identical, to, what, was, seen, through, the, unpainted, window, each, painted, object, in, the, scene, is, thus, a, flat, scaled, down, version, of, the, object, on, the, other, side, of, the, window, additionally, a, central, vanishing, point, can, be, used, just, as, with, one, point, perspective, to, indicate, frontal, foreshortened, depth, the, earliest, art, paintings, and, drawings, typically, sized, many, objects, and, characters, hierarchically, according, to, their, spiritual, or, thematic, importance, not, their, distance, from, the, viewer, and, did, not, use, foreshortening, the, most, important, figures, are, often, shown, as, the, highest, in, a, composition, also, from, hieratic, motives, leading, to, the, so, called, vertical, perspective, common, in, the, art, of, ancient, egypt, where, a, group, of, nearer, figures, are, shown, below, the, larger, figure, or, figures, simple, overlapping, was, also, employed, to, relate, distance, additionally, oblique, foreshortening, of, round, elements, like, shields, and, wheels, is, evident, in, ancient, greek, red, figure, pottery, systematic, attempts, to, evolve, a, system, of, perspective, are, usually, considered, to, have, begun, around, the, fifth, century, bc, in, the, art, of, ancient, greece, as, part, of, a, developing, interest, in, illusionism, allied, to, theatrical, scenery, this, was, detailed, within, aristotle, s, poetics, as, skenographia, using, flat, panels, on, a, stage, to, give, the, illusion, of, depth, the, philosophers, anaxagoras, and, democritus, worked, out, geometric, theories, of, perspective, for, use, with, skenographia, alcibiades, had, paintings, in, his, house, designed, using, skenographia, so, this, art, was, not, confined, merely, to, the, stage, euclid, in, his, optics, c, 300, bc, argues, correctly, that, the, perceived, size, of, an, object, is, not, related, to, its, distance, from, the, eye, by, a, simple, proportion, in, the, first, century, bc, frescoes, of, the, villa, of, p, fannius, synistor, multiple, vanishing, points, are, used, in, a, systematic, but, not, fully, consistent, manner, chinese, artists, made, use, of, oblique, projection, from, the, first, or, second, century, until, the, 18th, century, it, is, not, certain, how, they, came, to, use, the, technique, dubery, and, willats, 1983, speculate, that, the, chinese, acquired, the, technique, from, india, which, acquired, it, from, ancient, rome, while, others, credit, it, as, an, indigenous, invention, of, ancient, china, oblique, projection, is, also, seen, in, japanese, art, such, as, in, the, ukiyo, e, paintings, of, torii, kiyonaga, 1752, 1815, by, the, later, periods, of, antiquity, artists, especially, those, in, less, popular, traditions, were, well, aware, that, distant, objects, could, be, shown, smaller, than, those, close, at, hand, for, increased, realism, but, whether, this, convention, was, actually, used, in, a, work, depended, on, many, factors, some, of, the, paintings, found, in, the, ruins, of, pompeii, show, a, remarkable, realism, and, perspective, for, their, time, it, has, been, claimed, that, comprehensive, systems, of, perspective, were, evolved, in, antiquity, but, most, scholars, do, not, accept, this, hardly, any, of, the, many, works, where, such, a, system, would, have, been, used, have, survived, a, passage, in, philostratus, suggests, that, classical, artists, and, theorists, thought, in, terms, of, circles, at, equal, distance, from, the, viewer, like, a, classical, semi, circular, theatre, seen, from, the, stage, the, roof, beams, in, rooms, in, the, vatican, virgil, from, about, 400, ad, are, shown, converging, more, or, less, on, a, common, vanishing, point, but, this, is, not, systematically, related, to, the, rest, of, the, composition, medieval, artists, in, europe, like, those, in, the, islamic, world, and, china, were, aware, of, the, general, principle, of, varying, the, relative, size, of, elements, according, to, distance, but, even, more, than, classical, art, were, perfectly, ready, to, override, it, for, other, reasons, buildings, were, often, shown, obliquely, according, to, a, particular, convention, the, use, and, sophistication, of, attempts, to, convey, distance, increased, steadily, during, the, period, but, without, a, basis, in, a, systematic, theory, byzantine, art, was, also, aware, of, these, principles, but, also, used, the, reverse, perspective, convention, for, the, setting, of, principal, figures, ambrogio, lorenzetti, painted, a, floor, with, convergent, lines, in, his, presentation, at, the, temple, 1342, though, the, rest, of, the, painting, lacks, perspective, elements, it, is, generally, accepted, that, filippo, brunelleschi, conducted, a, series, of, experiments, between, 1415, and, 1420, which, included, making, drawings, of, various, florentine, buildings, in, correct, perspective, according, to, vasari, and, antonio, manetti, in, about, 1420, brunelleschi, demonstrated, his, discovery, by, having, people, look, through, a, hole, in, the, back, of, a, painting, he, had, made, through, it, they, would, see, a, building, such, as, the, florence, baptistery, when, brunelleschi, lifted, a, mirror, in, front, of, the, viewer, it, reflected, his, painting, of, the, buildings, which, had, been, seen, previously, so, that, the, vanishing, point, was, centered, from, the, perspective, of, the, participant, brunelleschi, applied, the, new, system, of, perspective, to, his, paintings, around, 1425, this, scenario, is, indicative, but, faces, several, problems, that, are, still, debated, first, of, all, nothing, can, be, said, for, certain, about, the, correctness, of, his, perspective, construction, of, the, baptistery, of, san, giovanni, because, brunelleschi, s, panel, is, lost, second, no, other, perspective, painting, or, drawing, by, brunelleschi, is, known, in, fact, brunelleschi, was, not, known, to, have, painted, at, all, third, in, the, account, written, by, antonio, manetti, in, his, vita, di, ser, brunellesco, at, the, end, of, the, 15th, century, on, brunelleschi, s, panel, there, is, not, a, single, occurrence, of, the, word, experiment, fourth, the, conditions, listed, by, manetti, are, contradictory, with, each, other, for, example, the, description, of, the, eyepiece, sets, a, visual, field, of, 15, much, narrower, than, the, visual, field, resulting, from, the, urban, landscape, described, soon, after, brunelleschi, s, demonstrations, nearly, every, interested, artist, in, florence, and, in, italy, used, geometrical, perspective, in, their, paintings, and, sculpture, notably, donatello, masaccio, lorenzo, ghiberti, masolino, da, panicale, paolo, uccello, and, filippo, lippi, not, only, was, perspective, a, way, of, showing, depth, it, was, also, a, new, method, of, creating, a, composition, visual, art, could, now, depict, a, single, unified, scene, rather, than, a, combination, of, several, early, examples, include, masolino, s, st, peter, healing, a, cripple, and, the, raising, of, tabitha, c, 1423, donatello, s, the, feast, of, herod, c, 1427, as, well, as, ghiberti, s, jacob, and, esau, and, other, panels, from, the, east, doors, of, the, florence, baptistery, masaccio, d, 1428, achieved, an, illusionistic, effect, by, placing, the, vanishing, point, at, the, viewer, s, eye, level, in, his, holy, trinity, c, 1427, and, in, the, tribute, money, it, is, placed, behind, the, face, of, jesus, in, the, late, 15th, century, melozzo, da, forl, first, applied, the, technique, of, foreshortening, in, rome, loreto, forl, and, others, this, overall, story, is, based, on, qualitative, judgments, and, would, need, to, be, faced, against, the, material, evaluations, that, have, been, conducted, on, renaissance, perspective, paintings, apart, from, the, paintings, of, piero, della, francesca, which, are, a, model, of, the, genre, the, majority, of, 15th, century, works, show, serious, errors, in, their, geometric, construction, this, is, true, of, masaccio, s, trinity, fresco, and, of, many, works, including, those, by, renowned, artists, like, leonardo, da, vinci, as, shown, by, the, quick, proliferation, of, accurate, perspective, paintings, in, florence, brunelleschi, likely, understood, with, help, from, his, friend, the, mathematician, toscanelli, but, did, not, publish, the, mathematics, behind, perspective, decades, later, his, friend, leon, battista, alberti, wrote, de, pictura, c, 1435, a, treatise, on, proper, methods, of, showing, distance, in, painting, alberti, s, primary, breakthrough, was, not, to, show, the, mathematics, in, terms, of, conical, projections, as, it, actually, appears, to, the, eye, instead, he, formulated, the, theory, based, on, planar, projections, or, how, the, rays, of, light, passing, from, the, viewer, s, eye, to, the, landscape, would, strike, the, picture, plane, the, painting, he, was, then, able, to, calculate, the, apparent, height, of, a, distant, object, using, two, similar, triangles, the, mathematics, behind, similar, triangles, is, relatively, simple, having, been, long, ago, formulated, by, euclid, alberti, was, also, trained, in, the, science, of, optics, through, the, school, of, padua, and, under, the, influence, of, biagio, pelacani, da, parma, who, studied, alhazen, s, book, of, optics, this, book, translated, around, 1200, into, latin, had, laid, the, mathematical, foundation, for, perspective, in, europe, piero, della, francesca, elaborated, on, de, pictura, in, his, de, prospectiva, pingendi, in, the, 1470s, making, many, references, to, euclid, alberti, had, limited, himself, to, figures, on, the, ground, plane, and, giving, an, overall, basis, for, perspective, della, francesca, fleshed, it, out, explicitly, covering, solids, in, any, area, of, the, picture, plane, della, francesca, also, started, the, now, common, practice, of, using, illustrated, figures, to, explain, the, mathematical, concepts, making, his, treatise, easier, to, understand, than, alberti, s, della, francesca, was, also, the, first, to, accurately, draw, the, platonic, solids, as, they, would, appear, in, perspective, luca, pacioli, s, 1509, divina, proportione, divine, proportion, illustrated, by, leonardo, da, vinci, summarizes, the, use, of, perspective, in, painting, including, much, of, della, francesca, s, treatise, leonardo, applied, one, point, perspective, as, well, as, shallow, focus, to, some, of, his, works, two, point, perspective, was, demonstrated, as, early, as, 1525, by, albrecht, d, rer, who, studied, perspective, by, reading, piero, and, pacioli, s, works, in, his, unterweisung, der, messung, instruction, of, the, measurement, perspective, images, are, created, with, reference, to, a, particular, center, of, vision, for, the, picture, plane, in, order, for, the, resulting, image, to, appear, identical, to, the, original, scene, a, viewer, must, view, the, image, from, the, exact, vantage, point, used, in, the, calculations, relative, to, the, image, when, viewed, from, a, different, point, this, cancels, out, what, would, appear, to, be, distortions, in, the, image, for, example, a, sphere, drawn, in, perspective, will, be, stretched, into, an, ellipse, these, apparent, distortions, are, more, pronounced, away, from, the, center, of, the, image, as, the, angle, between, a, projected, ray, from, the, scene, to, the, eye, becomes, more, acute, relative, to, the, picture, plane, artists, may, choose, to, correct, perspective, distortions, for, example, by, drawing, all, spheres, as, perfect, circles, or, by, drawing, figures, as, if, centered, on, the, direction, of, view, in, practice, unless, the, viewer, observes, the, image, from, an, extreme, angle, like, standing, far, to, the, side, of, a, painting, the, perspective, normally, looks, more, or, less, correct, this, is, referred, to, as, zeeman, s,
