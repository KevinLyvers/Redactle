he, sees, in, walton, the, same, obsession, that, has, destroyed, him, and, recounts, a, story, of, his, life, s, miseries, to, walton, as, a, warning, the, recounted, story, serves, as, the, frame, for, frankenstein, s, narrative, victor, begins, by, telling, of, his, childhood, born, in, naples, italy, into, a, wealthy, genevan, family, victor, and, his, younger, brothers, ernest, and, william, are, sons, of, alphonse, frankenstein, and, the, former, caroline, beaufort, from, a, young, age, victor, has, a, strong, desire, to, understand, the, world, he, is, obsessed, with, studying, theories, of, alchemists, though, when, he, is, older, he, realizes, that, such, theories, are, considerably, outdated, when, victor, is, five, years, old, his, parents, adopt, elizabeth, lavenza, the, orphaned, daughter, of, an, expropriated, italian, nobleman, whom, victor, plans, to, marry, victor, s, parents, later, take, in, another, child, justine, moritz, who, becomes, william, s, nanny,

university, he, excels, at, chemistry, and, other, sciences, soon, developing, a, secret, technique, to, impart, life, to, non, living, matter, he, undertakes, the, creation, of, a, humanoid, but, due, to, the, difficulty, in, replicating, the, minute, parts, of, the, human, body, victor, makes, the, creature, tall, about, 8, feet, 2, 4, m, in, height, and, proportionally, large, victor, works, at, gathering, the, vital, organs, by, pilfering, charnel, houses, mortuaries, and, by, entrapping, and, vivisecting, feral, animals, despite, victor, selecting, its, features, to, be, beautiful, upon, animation, the, creature, is, instead, hideous, with, dull, and, watery, yellow, eyes, and, yellow, skin, that, barely, conceals, the, muscles, and, blood, vessels, underneath, repulsed, by, his, work, victor, flees, while, wandering, the, streets, the, next, day, he, meets, his, childhood, friend, henry, clerval, and, takes, clerval, back, to, his, apartment, fearful, of, clerval, s, reaction, if, he, sees, the, monster, however, when, victor, returns, to, his, laboratory, the, creature, is, gone, victor, falls, ill, from, the, experience, and, is, nursed, back, to, health, by, clerval, after, recovering, he, forgets, about, the, creature, and, goes, into, clerval, s, study, of, oriental, languages, which, he, considers, the, happiest, time, of, his, academic, career, this, is, cut, short, when, victor, receives, a, letter, from, his, father, notifying, him, of, the, murder, of, his, brother, william, near, geneva, victor, sees, a, large, figure, and, becomes, convinced, that, his, creation, is, responsible, justine, moritz, william, s, nanny, is, convicted, of, the, crime, after, william, s, locket, which, contained, a, miniature, portrait, of, caroline, is, found, in, her, pocket, victor, knows, that, no, one, will, believe, him, if, he, testifies, that, it, was, the, doing, of, the, creature, justine, is, hanged, ravaged, by, grief, and, guilt, victor, takes, up, mountain, climbing, in, the, alps, while, hiking, through, mont, blanc, s, mer, de, glace, he, is, suddenly, approached, by, the, creature, who, insists, that, victor, hear, his, tale, intelligent, and, articulate, the, creature, relates, his, first, days, of, life, living, alone, in, the, wilderness, he, found, that, people, were, afraid, of, him, and, hated, him, due, to, his, appearance, which, led, him, to, fear, and, hide, from, them, while, living, in, an, abandoned, structure, connected, to, a, cottage, he, grew, fond, of, the, poor, family, living, there, and, discreetly, collected, firewood, for, them, cleared, snow, away, from, their, path, and, performed, other, tasks, to, help, them, secretly, living, next, to, the, cottage, for, months, the, creature, learned, that, the, son, was, going, to, marry, a, turkish, woman, whom, he, was, teaching, his, native, language, which, the, creature, listened, in, on, the, lessons, and, taught, himself, to, speak, and, write, the, creature, also, taught, himself, to, read, after, discovering, a, lost, satchel, of, books, in, the, woods, when, he, saw, his, reflection, in, a, pool, he, realized, his, appearance, was, hideous, and, it, horrified, him, as, much, as, it, horrified, normal, humans, as, he, continued, to, learn, of, the, family, s, plight, he, grew, increasingly, attached, to, them, and, eventually, he, approached, the, family, in, hopes, of, becoming, their, friend, entering, the, house, while, only, the, blind, father, was, present, the, two, conversed, but, on, the, return, of, the, others, the, rest, of, them, were, frightened, the, blind, man, s, son, attacked, him, and, the, creature, fled, the, house, the, next, day, the, family, left, their, home, out, of, fear, that, he, would, return, witnessing, this, the, monster, renounced, any, hope, of, being, accepted, by, humanity, and, vowed, to, get, his, revenge, although, he, hated, his, creator, for, abandoning, him, he, decided, to, travel, to, geneva, to, find, him, because, he, believed, that, victor, was, the, only, person, with, a, responsibility, to, help, him, on, the, journey, he, rescued, a, child, who, had, fallen, into, a, river, but, her, father, believing, that, the, creature, intended, to, harm, them, shot, him, in, the, shoulder, the, creature, then, swore, revenge, against, all, humans, he, travelled, to, geneva, using, details, from, a, combination, of, victor, s, journal, and, geography, lessons, gleaned, from, the, family, when, in, switzerland, he, chanced, upon, william, who, was, at, first, frightened, and, the, creature, held, his, wrist, to, calm, him, when, the, boy, screamed, his, full, name, and, that, he, had, powerful, parents, this, sparked, the, creature, into, killing, the, boy, to, spite, victor, the, creature, then, took, william, s, locket, and, placed, it, into, the, dress, of, justine, incriminating, her, as, the, murderer, the, creature, demands, that, victor, create, a, female, companion, like, himself, he, argues, that, as, a, living, being, he, has, a, right, to, happiness, the, creature, promises, that, he, and, his, mate, will, vanish, into, the, south, american, wilderness, never, to, reappear, if, victor, grants, his, request, should, victor, refuse, the, creature, threatens, to, kill, victor, s, remaining, friends, and, loved, ones, and, not, stop, until, he, completely, ruins, him, fearing, for, his, family, victor, reluctantly, agrees, the, creature, says, he, will, watch, over, victor, s, progress, clerval, accompanies, victor, to, england, but, they, separate, at, victor, s, insistence, at, perth, in, scotland, travelling, to, orkney, to, build, the, second, creature, victor, suspects, that, the, creature, is, following, him, as, he, works, on, the, new, creature, he, is, plagued, by, premonitions, of, disaster, he, fears, that, the, female, will, hate, the, creature, or, worse, still, be, even, more, evil, than, he, is, even, more, worrying, to, him, is, the, idea, that, creating, the, second, creature, might, lead, to, the, creation, of, a, race, of, beings, just, as, strong, as, the, monster, who, could, plague, humanity, he, tears, apart, the, unfinished, female, creature, after, he, sees, the, creature, who, had, indeed, followed, victor, watching, through, a, window, the, creature, immediately, bursts, through, the, door, to, confront, victor, and, demands, he, repair, his, destruction, and, resume, work, but, victor, refuses, the, creature, leaves, but, gives, a, final, threat, i, will, be, with, you, on, your, wedding, night, victor, interprets, this, as, a, threat, upon, his, life, believing, that, the, creature, will, kill, him, after, he, finally, becomes, happy, victor, sails, out, to, sea, to, dispose, of, his, instruments, and, falls, asleep, in, the, boat, he, awakens, some, time, later, and, is, unable, to, return, to, shore, due, to, a, change, in, the, wind, and, falls, unconscious, drifting, to, ireland, when, victor, awakens, he, is, arrested, for, murder, despite, the, severity, of, the, charges, he, is, met, with, sympathy, from, the, magistrate, in, charge, of, the, trial, which, suggests, that, the, case, is, crumbling, victor, is, acquitted, when, eyewitness, testimony, confirms, that, he, was, in, orkney, at, the, time, the, murder, took, place, however, when, shown, the, murder, victim, victor, is, horrified, to, see, it, was, henry, clerval, whom, the, creature, strangled, as, part, of, his, promise, to, kill, all, his, friends, and, family, victor, suffers, another, mental, breakdown, and, after, recovering, he, returns, home, with, his, father, who, has, restored, to, elizabeth, some, of, her, father, s, fortune, his, father, does, not, know, of, the, cause, behind, the, murders, of, william, and, henry, but, senses, a, curse, and, begs, victor, to, honour, his, mother, s, last, wish, that, victor, marry, elizabeth, in, geneva, victor, is, about, to, marry, elizabeth, and, prepares, to, fight, the, creature, to, the, death, arming, himself, with, pistols, and, a, dagger, the, night, following, their, wedding, victor, asks, elizabeth, to, stay, in, her, room, while, he, looks, for, the, fiend, while, victor, searches, the, house, and, grounds, the, creature, strangles, elizabeth, from, the, window, victor, sees, the, creature, who, tauntingly, points, at, elizabeth, s, corpse, victor, tries, to, shoot, him, but, the, creature, escapes, victor, s, father, weakened, by, age, and, by, the, death, of, elizabeth, dies, a, few, days, later, seeking, revenge, victor, pursues, the, creature, across, europe, and, russia, though, his, adversary, stays, one, step, ahead, of, him, at, all, times, eventually, the, chase, leads, to, the, arctic, ocean, and, then, on, towards, the, north, pole, and, victor, reaches, a, point, where, he, is, within, a, mile, of, the, creature, but, he, collapses, from, exhaustion, and, hypothermia, before, he, can, find, his, quarry, allowing, the, creature, to, escape, eventually, the, ice, around, victor, s, sledge, breaks, apart, and, the, resultant, ice, floe, comes, within, range, of, walton, s, ship, at, the, end, of, victor, s, narrative, captain, walton, resumes, telling, the, story, a, few, days, after, the, creature, vanishes, the, ship, is, trapped, by, pack, ice, for, a, second, time, and, several, crewmen, die, in, the, cold, before, the, rest, of, walton, s, crew, insists, on, returning, south, once, it, is, freed, upon, hearing, the, crew, s, demands, victor, is, angered, and, despite, his, condition, gives, a, powerful, speech, to, them, he, reminds, them, of, why, they, chose, to, join, the, expedition, and, that, it, is, hardship, and, danger, not, comfort, that, defines, a, glorious, undertaking, such, as, theirs, he, urges, them, to, be, men, not, cowards, however, although, the, speech, makes, an, impression, on, the, crew, it, is, not, enough, to, change, their, minds, knowing, that, continuing, on, would, surely, result, in, mutiny, walton, agrees, to, abandon, the, voyage, and, return, home, but, victor, despite, his, condition, declares, that, he, will, continue, to, hunt, the, creature, and, is, adamant, that, he, must, be, killed, victor, dies, shortly, thereafter, telling, walton, in, his, last, words, to, seek, happiness, in, tranquillity, and, avoid, ambition, walton, discovers, the, creature, on, his, ship, mourning, over, victor, s, body, the, creature, tells, walton, that, victor, s, death, has, not, brought, him, peace, rather, his, crimes, have, made, him, even, more, miserable, than, victor, ever, was, the, creature, vows, to, burn, himself, on, a, funeral, pyre, so, that, no, one, else, will, ever, know, of, his, existence, walton, watches, as, the, creature, drifts, away, on, an, ice, raft, never, to, be, seen, again, mary, shelley, s, mother, mary, wollstonecraft, died, from, infection, eleven, days, after, giving, birth, to, her, shelley, grew, close, to, her, father, william, godwin, having, never, known, her, mother, godwin, hired, a, nurse, who, briefly, cared, for, her, and, her, half, sister, before, marrying, second, wife, mary, jane, clairmont, who, did, not, like, the, close, bond, between, shelley, and, her, father, the, resulting, friction, caused, godwin, to, favour, his, other, children, shelley, s, father, was, a, famous, author, of, the, time, and, her, education, was, of, great, importance, to, him, although, it, was, not, formal, shelley, grew, up, surrounded, by, her, father, s, friends, writers, and, persons, of, political, importance, who, often, gathered, at, the, family, home, this, inspired, her, authorship, at, an, early, age, mary, at, the, age, of, sixteen, met, percy, bysshe, shelley, who, later, became, her, husband, while, he, was, visiting, her, father, godwin, did, not, approve, of, the, relationship, between, his, daughter, and, an, older, married, man, so, they, fled, to, france, along, with, her, stepsister, claire, clairmont, it, was, during, their, trip, to, france, that, percy, probably, had, an, affair, with, mary, s, stepsister, claire, on, 22, february, 1815, shelley, gave, birth, prematurely, to, her, first, child, clara, who, died, two, weeks, later, over, eight, years, she, endured, a, similar, pattern, of, pregnancy, and, loss, one, haemorrhage, occurring, until, percy, placed, her, upon, ice, to, cease, the, bleeding, in, the, summer, of, 1816, mary, percy, and, claire, took, a, trip, to, visit, claire, s, lover, lord, byron, in, geneva, poor, weather, conditions, more, akin, to, winter, forced, byron, and, the, visitors, to, stay, indoors, to, help, pass, time, byron, suggested, that, he, mary, percy, and, byron, s, physician, john, polidori, have, a, competition, to, write, the, best, ghost, story, to, pass, time, stuck, indoors, historians, suggest, that, an, affair, occurred, too, even, that, the, father, of, one, of, shelley, s, children, may, have, been, byron, mary, was, just, eighteen, years, old, when, she, won, the, contest, with, her, creation, of, frankenstein, shelley, s, work, was, heavily, influenced, by, that, of, her, parents, her, father, was, famous, for, enquiry, concerning, political, justice, and, her, mother, famous, for, a, vindication, of, the, rights, of, woman, her, father, s, novels, also, influenced, her, writing, of, frankenstein, these, novels, included, things, as, they, are, or, the, adventures, of, caleb, williams, st, leon, and, fleetwood, all, of, these, books, were, set, in, switzerland, similar, to, the, setting, in, frankenstein, some, major, themes, of, social, affections, and, the, renewal, of, life, that, appear, in, shelley, s, novel, stem, from, these, works, she, had, in, her, possession, other, literary, influences, that, appear, in, frankenstein, are, pygmalion, et, galat, e, by, mme, de, genlis, and, ovid, with, the, use, of, individuals, identifying, the, problems, with, society, ovid, also, inspires, the, use, of, prometheus, in, shelley, s, title, the, influence, of, john, milton, s, paradise, lost, and, samuel, taylor, coleridge, s, the, rime, of, the, ancient, mariner, are, clearly, evident, in, the, novel, in, the, frankenstein, of, the, french, revolution, author, julia, douthwaite, posits, that, shelley, probably, acquired, some, ideas, for, frankenstein, s, character, from, humphry, davy, s, book, elements, of, chemical, philosophy, in, which, he, had, written, that, science, has, bestowed, upon, man, powers, which, may, be, called, creative, which, have, enabled, him, to, change, and, modify, the, beings, around, him, references, to, the, french, revolution, run, through, the, novel, a, likely, source, is, fran, ois, f, lix, nogaret, s, le, miroir, des, v, nemens, actuels, ou, la, belle, au, plus, offrant, 1790, a, political, parable, about, scientific, progress, featuring, an, inventor, named, frank, ste, n, who, creates, a, life, sized, automaton, both, frankenstein, and, the, monster, quote, passages, from, percy, shelley, s, 1816, poem, mutability, and, its, theme, of, the, role, of, the, subconscious, is, discussed, in, prose, percy, shelley, s, name, never, appeared, as, the, author, of, the, poem, although, the, novel, credits, other, quoted, poets, by, name, samuel, taylor, coleridge, s, poem, the, rime, of, the, ancient, mariner, 1798, is, associated, with, the, theme, of, guilt, and, william, wordsworth, s, tintern, abbey, 1798, with, that, of, innocence, many, writers, and, historians, have, attempted, to, associate, several, then, popular, natural, philosophers, now, called, physical, scientists, with, shelley, s, work, because, of, several, notable, similarities, two, of, the, most, noted, natural, philosophers, among, shelley, s, contemporaries, were, giovanni, aldini, who, made, many, public, attempts, at, human, reanimation, through, bio, electric, galvanism, in, london, and, johann, konrad, dippel, who, was, supposed, to, have, developed, chemical, means, to, extend, the, life, span, of, humans, while, shelley, was, aware, of, both, of, these, men, and, their, activities, she, makes, no, mention, of, or, reference, to, them, or, their, experiments, in, any, of, her, published, or, released, notes, ideas, about, life, and, death, discussed, by, percy, and, byron, were, of, great, interest, to, scientists, of, that, time, they, discussed, ideas, from, erasmus, darwin, and, the, experiments, of, luigi, galvani, as, well, as, james, lind, mary, joined, these, conversations, and, the, ideas, of, darwin, galvani, and, perhaps, lind, were, present, in, her, novel, shelley, s, personal, experiences, also, influenced, the, themes, within, frankenstein, the, themes, of, loss, guilt, and, the, consequences, of, defying, nature, present, in, the, novel, all, developed, from, mary, shelley, s, own, life, the, loss, of, her, mother, the, relationship, with, her, father, and, the, death, of, her, first, child, are, thought, to, have, inspired, the, monster, and, his, separation, from, parental, guidance, in, a, 1965, issue, of, the, journal, of, religion, and, health, a, psychologist, proposed, that, the, theme, of, guilt, stemmed, from, her, not, feeling, good, enough, for, percy, because, of, the, loss, of, their, child, during, the, rainy, summer, of, 1816, the, year, without, a, summer, the, world, was, locked, in, a, long, cold, volcanic, winter, caused, by, the, eruption, of, mount, tambora, in, 1815, mary, shelley, aged, 18, and, her, lover, and, future, husband, percy, bysshe, shelley, visited, lord, byron, at, the, villa, diodati, by, lake, geneva, in, switzerland, s, alps, the, weather, was, too, cold, and, dreary, that, summer, to, enjoy, the, outdoor, holiday, activities, they, had, planned, so, the, group, retired, indoors, until, dawn, sitting, around, a, log, fire, at, byron, s, villa, the, company, amused, themselves, by, reading, german, ghost, stories, translated, into, french, from, the, book, fantasmagoriana, byron, proposed, that, they, each, write, a, ghost, story, unable, to, think, of, a, story, mary, shelley, became, anxious, she, recalled, being, asked, have, you, thought, of, a, story, each, morning, and, every, time, being, forced, to, reply, with, a, mortifying, negative, during, one, evening, in, the, middle, of, summer, the, discussions, turned, to, the, nature, of, the, principle, of, life, perhaps, a, corpse, would, be, re, animated, mary, noted, galvanism, had, given, token, of, such, things, it, was, after, midnight, before, they, retired, and, unable, to, sleep, she, became, possessed, by, her, imagination, as, she, beheld, the, grim, terrors, of, her, waking, dream, i, saw, the, pale, student, of, unhallowed, arts, kneeling, beside, the, thing, he, had, put, together, i, saw, the, hideous, phantasm, of, a, man, stretched, out, and, then, on, the, working, of, some, powerful, engine, show, signs, of, life, and, stir, with, an, uneasy, half, vital, motion, frightful, must, it, be, for, supremely, frightful, would, be, the, effect, of, any, human, endeavour, to, mock, the, stupendous, mechanism, of, the, creator, of, the, world, in, september, 2011, astronomer, donald, olson, after, a, visit, to, the, lake, geneva, villa, the, previous, year, and, inspecting, data, about, the, motion, of, the, moon, and, stars, concluded, that, her, waking, dream, took, place, between, 2, a, m, and, 3, a, m, on, 16, june, 1816, several, days, after, the, initial, idea, by, lord, byron, that, they, each, write, a, ghost, story, mary, shelley, began, writing, what, she, assumed, would, be, a, short, story, but, with, percy, shelley, s, encouragement, she, expanded, the, tale, into, a, fully, fledged, novel, she, later, described, that, summer, in, switzerland, as, the, moment, when, i, first, stepped, out, from, childhood, into, life, shelley, wrote, the, first, four, chapters, in, the, weeks, following, the, suicide, of, her, half, sister, fanny, this, was, one, of, many, personal, tragedies, that, impacted, shelley, s, work, shelley, s, first, child, died, in, infancy, and, when, she, began, composing, frankenstein, in, 1816, she, was, probably, nursing, her, second, child, who, was, also, dead, by, the, time, of, frankenstein, s, publication, shelley, wrote, much, of, the, book, while, residing, in, a, lodging, house, in, the, centre, of, bath, in, 1816, byron, managed, to, write, just, a, fragment, based, on, the, vampire, legends, he, heard, while, travelling, the, balkans, and, from, this, john, polidori, created, the, vampyre, 1819, the, progenitor, of, the, romantic, vampire, literary, genre, thus, two, seminal, horror, tales, originated, from, the, conclave, the, group, talked, about, enlightenment, and, counter, enlightenment, ideas, as, well, mary, shelley, believed, the, enlightenment, idea, that, society, could, progress, and, grow, if, political, leaders, used, their, powers, responsibly, however, she, also, believed, the, romantic, ideal, that,

edition, of, frankenstein, edited, by, charles, e, robinson, that, contains, comparisons, of, mary, shelley, s, original, text, with, percy, shelley, s, additions, and, interventions, alongside, although, the, creature, was, described, in, later, works, as, a, composite, of, whole, body, parts, grafted, together, from, cadavers, and, reanimated, by, the, use, of, electricity, this, description, is, not, consistent, with, shelley, s, work, both, the, use, of, electricity, and, the, cobbled, together, image, of, frankenstein, s, monster, were, more, the, result, of, james, whale, s, popular, 1931, film, adaptation, of, the, story, and, other, early, motion, picture, works, based, on, the, creature, in, shelley, s, original, work, victor, frankenstein, discovers, a, previously, unknown, but, elemental, principle, of, life, and, that, insight, allows, him, to, develop, a, method, to, imbue, vitality, into, inanimate, matter, though, the, exact, nature, of, the, process, is, left, ambiguous, after, a, great, deal, of, hesitation, in, exercising, this, power, frankenstein, spends, two, years, painstakingly, constructing, the, creature, s, body, one, anatomical, feature, at, a, time, from, raw, materials, supplied, by, the, dissecting, room, and, the, slaughter, house, which, he, then, brings, to, life, using, his, unspecified, process, part, of, frankenstein, s, rejection, of, his, creation, is, the, fact, that, he, does, not, give, him, a, name, instead, frankenstein, s, creation, is, referred, to, by, words, such, as, wretch, monster, creature, demon, devil, fiend, and, it, when, frankenstein, converses, with, the, creature, he, addresses, him, as, vile, insect, abhorred, monster, fiend, wretched, devil, and, abhorred, devil, in, the, novel, the, creature, is, compared, to, adam, the, first, man, in, the, garden, of, eden, the, monster, also, compares, himself, with, the, fallen, angel, speaking, to, frankenstein, the, monster, says, i, ought, to, be, thy, adam, but, i, am, rather, the, fallen, angel, that, angel, would, be, lucifer, meaning, light, bringer, in, milton, s, paradise, lost, which, the, monster, has, read, adam, is, also, referred, to, in, the, epigraph, of, the, 1818, edition, some, have, posited, the, creature, as, a, composite, of, percy, shelley, and, thomas, paine, if, the, creature, s, hatred, for, victor, and, his, desire, to, raise, a, child, mirror, percy, s, filial, rebelliousness, and, his, longing, to, adopt, children, his, desire, to, do, good, and, his, persecution, can, be, said, to, echo, paine, s, utopian, visions, and, fate, in, england, the, creature, has, often, been, mistakenly, called, frankenstein, in, 1908, one, author, said, it, is, strange, to, note, how, well, nigh, universally, the, term, frankenstein, is, misused, even, by, intelligent, people, as, describing, some, hideous, monster, edith, wharton, s, the, reef, 1916, describes, an, unruly, child, as, an, infant, frankenstein, david, lindsay, s, the, bridal, ornament, published, in, the, rover, 12, june, 1844, mentioned, the, maker, of, poor, frankenstein, after, the, release, of, whale, s, cinematic, frankenstein, the, public, at, large, began, speaking, of, the, creature, itself, as, frankenstein, this, misnomer, continued, with, the, successful, sequel, bride, of, frankenstein, 1935, as, well, as, in, film, titles, such, as, abbott, and, costello, meet, frankenstein, mary, shelley, maintained, that, she, derived, the, name, frankenstein, from, a, dream, vision, this, claim, has, since, been, disputed, and, debated, by, scholars, that, have, suggested, alternative, sources, for, shelley, s, inspiration, the, german, name, frankenstein, means, stone, of, the, franks, and, is, associated, with, various, places, in, germany, including, frankenstein, castle, burg, frankenstein, in, darmstadt, hesse, and, frankenstein, castle, in, frankenstein, a, town, in, the, palatinate, there, is, also, a, castle, called, frankenstein, in, bad, salzungen, thuringia, and, a, municipality, called, frankenstein, in, saxony, the, town, of, frankenstein, in, silesia, now, z, bkowice, poland, was, the, site, of, a, scandal, involving, gravediggers, in, 1606, and, this, has, been, suggested, as, an, inspiration, to, the, author, finally, the, name, is, borne, by, the, aristocratic, house, of, franckenstein, from, franconia, radu, florescu, argued, that, mary, and, percy, shelley, visited, frankenstein, castle, near, darmstadt, in, 1814, where, alchemist, johann, konrad, dippel, had, experimented, with, human, bodies, and, reasoned, that, mary, suppressed, mention, of, her, visit, to, maintain, her, public, claim, of, originality, a, literary, essay, by, a, j, day, supports, florescu, s, position, that, mary, shelley, knew, of, and, visited, frankenstein, castle, before, writing, her, debut, novel, day, includes, details, of, an, alleged, description, of, the, frankenstein, castle, in, mary, shelley, s, lost, journals, however, according, to, j, rg, hel, ne, day, s, and, florescu, s, claims, cannot, be, verified, a, possible, interpretation, of, the, name, victor, is, derived, from, paradise, lost, by, john, milton, a, great, influence, on, shelley, a, quotation, from, paradise, lost, is, on, the, opening, page, of, frankenstein, and, shelley, writes, that, the, monster, reads, it, in, the, novel, milton, frequently, refers, to, god, as, the, victor, in, paradise, lost, and, victor, s, creation, of, life, in, the, novel, is, compared, to, god, s, creation, of, life, in, paradise, lost, in, addition, shelley, s, portrayal, of, the, monster, owes, much, to, the, character, of, satan, in, paradise, lost, and, the, monster, says, in, the, story, after, reading, the, epic, poem, that, he, empathizes, with, satan, s, role, parallels, between, victor, frankenstein, and, mary, s, husband, percy, shelley, have, also, been, drawn, percy, shelley,

victor, s, adopted, sister, were, both, named, elizabeth, there, are, many, other, similarities, from, percy, s, usage, of, victor, as, a, pen, name, for, original, poetry, by, victor, and, cazire, a, collection, of, poetry, he, wrote, with, elizabeth, to, percy, s, days, at, eton, where, he, had, experimented, with, electricity, and, magnetism, as, well, as, with, gunpowder, and, numerous,

fixing, him, to, a, rock, of, caucasus, where, each, day, an, eagle, pecked, out, his, liver, only, for, the, liver, to, regrow, the, next, day, because, of, his, immortality, as, a, god, as, a, pythagorean, or, believer, in, an, essay, on, abstinence, from, animal, food, as, a, moral, duty, by, joseph, ritson, mary, shelley, saw, prometheus, not, as, a, hero, but, rather, as, something, of, a, devil, and, blamed, him, for, bringing, fire, to, humanity, and, thereby, seducing, the, human, race, to, the, vice, of, eating, meat, percy, wrote, several, essays, on, what, became, known, as,

the, author, is, known, as, the, daughter, of, william, godwin, the, criticism, of, the, novel, makes, reference, to, the, feminine, nature, of, mary, shelley, the, british, critic, attacks, the, novel, s, flaws, as, the, fault, of, the, author, the, writer, of, it, is, we, understand, a, female, this, is, an, aggravation, of, that, which, is, the, prevailing, fault, of, the, novel, but, if, our, authoress, can, forget, the, gentleness, of, her, sex, it, is, no, reason, why, we, should, and, we, shall, therefore, dismiss, the, novel, without, further, comment, the, literary, panorama,
