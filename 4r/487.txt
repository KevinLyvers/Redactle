renaissance, art, 1350, 1620, is, the, painting, sculpture, and, decorative, arts, of, the, period, of, european, history, known, as, the, renaissance, which, emerged, as, a, distinct, style, in, italy, in, about, ad, 1400, in, parallel, with, developments, which, occurred, in, philosophy, literature, music, science, and, technology, renaissance, art, took, as, its, foundation, the, art, of, classical, antiquity, perceived, as, the, noblest, of, ancient, traditions, but, transformed, that, tradition, by, absorbing, recent, developments, in, the, art, of, northern, europe, and, by, applying, contemporary, scientific, knowledge, along, with, renaissance, humanist, philosophy, it, spread, throughout, europe, affecting, both, artists, and, their, patrons, with, the, development, of, new, techniques, and, new, artistic, sensibilities, for, art, historians, renaissance, art, marks, the, transition, of, europe, from, the, medieval, period, to, the, early, modern, age, the, body, of, art, including, painting, sculpture, architecture, music, and, literature, identified, as, renaissance, art, was, primarily, produced, during, the, 14th, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, in, europe, under, the, combined, influences, of, an, increased, awareness, of, nature, a, revival, of, classical, learning, and, a, more, individualistic, view, of, man, scholars, no, longer, believe, that, the, renaissance, marked, an, abrupt, break, with, medieval, values, as, is, suggested, by, the, french, word, renaissance, literally, meaning, rebirth, in, many, parts, of, europe, early, renaissance, art, was, created, in, parallel, with, late, medieval, art, many, influences, on, the, development, of, renaissance, men, and, women, in, the, early, 15th, century, have, been, credited, with, the, emergence, of, renaissance, art, they, are, the, same, as, those, that, affected, philosophy, literature, architecture, theology, science, government, and, other, aspects, of, society, the, following, list, presents, a, summary, of, changes, to, social, and, cultural, conditions, which, have, been, identified, as, factors, which, contributed, to, the, development, of, renaissance, art, each, is, dealt, with, more, fully, in, the, main, articles, cited, above, the, scholars, of, renaissance, period, focused, on, present, life, and, ways, improve, human, life, they, did, not, pay, much, attention, to, medieval, philosophy, or, religion, during, this, period, scholars, and, humanists, like, erasmus, dante, and, petrarch, criticized, superstitious, beliefs, and, also, questioned, them, the, concept, of, education, also, widened, its, spectrum, and, focused, more, on, creating, an, ideal, man, who, would, have, a, fair, understanding, of, arts, music, poetry, and, literature, and, would, have, the, ability, to, appreciate, these, aspects, of, life, in, italy, in, the, late, 13th, and, early, 14th, centuries, the, sculpture, of, nicola, pisano, and, his, son, giovanni, pisano, working, at, pisa, siena, and, pistoia, shows, markedly, classicising, tendencies, probably, influenced, by, the, familiarity, of, these, artists, with, ancient, roman, sarcophagi, their, masterpieces, are, the, pulpits, of, the, baptistery, and, cathedral, of, pisa, contemporary, with, giovanni, pisano, the, florentine, painter, giotto, developed, a, manner, of, figurative, painting, that, was, unprecedentedly, naturalistic, three, dimensional, lifelike, and, classicist, when, compared, with, that, of, his, contemporaries, and, teacher, cimabue, giotto, whose, greatest, work, is, the, cycle, of, the, life, of, christ, at, the, arena, chapel, in, padua, was, seen, by, the, 16th, century, biographer, giorgio, vasari, as, rescuing, and, restoring, art, from, the, crude, traditional, byzantine, style, prevalent, in, italy, in, the, 13th, century, although, both, the, pisanos, and, giotto, had, students, and, followers, the, first, truly, renaissance, artists, were, not, to, emerge, in, florence, until, 1401, with, the, competition, to, sculpt, a, set, of, bronze, doors, of, the, baptistery, of, florence, cathedral, which, drew, entries, from, seven, young, sculptors, including, brunelleschi, donatello, and, the, winner, lorenzo, ghiberti, brunelleschi, most, famous, as, the, architect, of, the, dome, of, florence, cathedral, and, the, church, of, san, lorenzo, created, a, number, of, sculptural, works, including, a, life, sized, crucifix, in, santa, maria, novella, renowned, for, its, naturalism, his, studies, of, perspective, are, thought, to, have, influenced, the, painter, masaccio, donatello, became, renowned, as, the, greatest, sculptor, of, the, early, renaissance, his, masterpieces, being, his, humanist, and, unusually, erotic, statue, of, david, one, of, the, icons, of, the, florentine, republic, and, his, great, monument, to, gattamelata, the, first, large, equestrian, bronze, to, be, created, since, roman, times, the, contemporary, of, donatello, masaccio, was, the, painterly, descendant, of, giotto, and, began, the, early, renaissance, in, italian, painting, in, 1425, furthering, the, trend, towards, solidity, of, form, and, naturalism, of, face, and, gesture, that, giotto, had, begun, a, century, earlier, from, 1425, to, 1428, masaccio, completed, several, panel, paintings, but, is, best, known, for, the, fresco, cycle, that, he, began, in, the, brancacci, chapel, with, the, older, artist, masolino, and, which, had, a, profound, influence, on, later, painters, including, michelangelo, masaccio, s, developments, were, carried, forward, in, the, paintings, of, fra, angelico, particularly, in, his, frescos, at, the, convent, of, san, marco, in, florence, the, treatment, of, the, elements, of, perspective, and, light, in, painting, was, of, particular, concern, to, 15th, century, florentine, painters, uccello, was, so, obsessed, with, trying, to, achieve, an, appearance, of, perspective, that, according, to, giorgio, vasari, it, disturbed, his, sleep, his, solutions, can, be, seen, in, his, masterpiece, set, of, three, paintings, the, battle, of, san, romano, which, is, believed, to, have, been, completed, by, 1460, piero, della, francesca, made, systematic, and, scientific, studies, of, both, light, and, linear, perspective, the, results, of, which, can, be, seen, in, his, fresco, cycle, of, the, history, of, the, true, cross, in, san, francesco, arezzo, in, naples, the, painter, antonello, da, messina, began, using, oil, paints, for, portraits, and, religious, paintings, at, a, date, that, preceded, other, italian, painters, possibly, about, 1450, he, carried, this, technique, north, and, influenced, the, painters, of, venice, one, of, the, most, significant, painters, of, northern, italy, was, andrea, mantegna, who, decorated, the, interior, of, a, room, the, camera, degli, sposi, for, his, patron, ludovico, gonzaga, setting, portraits, of, the, family, and, court, into, an, illusionistic, architectural, space, the, end, period, of, the, early, renaissance, in, italian, art, is, marked, like, its, beginning, by, a, particular, commission, that, drew, artists, together, this, time, in, cooperation, rather, than, competition, pope, sixtus, iv, had, rebuilt, the, papal, chapel, named, the, sistine, chapel, in, his, honour, and, commissioned, a, group, of, artists, sandro, botticelli, pietro, perugino, domenico, ghirlandaio, and, cosimo, rosselli, to, decorate, its, wall, with, fresco, cycles, depicting, the, life, of, christ, and, the, life, of, moses, in, the, sixteen, large, paintings, the, artists, although, each, working, in, his, individual, style, agreed, on, principles, of, format, and, utilised, the, techniques, of, lighting, linear, and, atmospheric, perspective, anatomy, foreshortening, and, characterisation, that, had, been, carried, to, a, high, point, in, the, large, florentine, studios, of, ghiberti, verrocchio, ghirlandaio, and, perugino, the, painters, of, the, low, countries, in, this, period, included, jan, van, eyck, his, brother, hubert, van, eyck, robert, campin, hans, memling, rogier, van, der, weyden, and, hugo, van, der, goes, their, painting, developed, partly, independently, of, early, italian, renaissance, painting, and, without, the, influence, of, a, deliberate, and, conscious, striving, to, revive, antiquity, the, style, of, painting, grew, directly, out, of, medieval, painting, in, tempera, on, panels, and, illuminated, manuscripts, and, other, forms, such, as, stained, glass, the, medium, of, fresco, was, less, common, in, northern, europe, the, medium, used, was, oil, paint, which, had, long, been, utilised, for, painting, leather, ceremonial, shields, and, accoutrements, because, it, was, flexible, and, relatively, durable, the, earliest, netherlandish, oil, paintings, are, meticulous, and, detailed, like, tempera, paintings, the, material, lent, itself, to, the, depiction, of, tonal, variations, and, texture, so, facilitating, the, observation, of, nature, in, great, detail, the, netherlandish, painters, did, not, approach, the, creation, of, a, picture, through, a, framework, of, linear, perspective, and, correct, proportion, they, maintained, a, medieval, view, of, hierarchical, proportion, and, religious, symbolism, while, delighting, in, a, realistic, treatment, of, material, elements, both, natural, and, man, made, jan, van, eyck, with, his, brother, hubert, painted, the, altarpiece, of, the, mystical, lamb, it, is, probable, that, antonello, da, messina, became, familiar, with, van, eyck, s, work, while, in, naples, or, sicily, in, 1475, hugo, van, der, goes, portinari, altarpiece, arrived, in, florence, where, it, was, to, have, a, profound, influence, on, many, painters, most, immediately, domenico, ghirlandaio, who, painted, an, altarpiece, imitating, its, elements, a, very, significant, netherlandish, painter, towards, the, end, of, the, period, was, hieronymus, bosch, who, employed, the, type, of, fanciful, forms, that, were, often, utilized, to, decorate, borders, and, letters, in, illuminated, manuscripts, combining, plant, and, animal, forms, with, architectonic, ones, when, taken, from, the, context, of, the, illumination, and, peopled, with, humans, these, forms, give, bosch, s, paintings, a, surreal, quality, which, have, no, parallel, in, the, work, of, any, other, renaissance, painter, his, masterpiece, is, the, triptych, the, garden, of, earthly, delights, the, artists, of, france, including, duchies, such, as, burgundy, were, often, associated, with, courts, providing, illuminated, manuscripts, and, portraits, for, the, nobility, as, well, as, devotional, paintings, and, altarpieces, among, the, most, famous, were, the, limbourg, brothers, flemish, illuminators, and, creators, of, the, tr, s, riches, heures, du, duc, de, berry, manuscript, illumination, jean, fouquet, painter, of, the, royal, court, visited, italy, in, 1437, and, reflects, the, influence, of, florentine, painters, such, as, paolo, uccello, although, best, known, for, his, portraits, such, as, that, of, charles, vii, of, france, fouquet, also, created, illuminations, and, is, thought, to, be, the, inventor, of, the, portrait, miniature, there, were, a, number, of, artists, at, this, date, who, painted, famous, altarpieces, that, are, stylistically, quite, distinct, from, both, the, italian, and, the, flemish, these, include, two, enigmatic, figures, enguerrand, quarton, to, whom, is, ascribed, the, pieta, of, villeneuve, l, s, avignon, and, jean, hey, otherwise, known, as, the, master, of, moulins, after, his, most, famous, work, the, moulins, altarpiece, in, these, works, realism, and, close, observation, of, the, human, figure, emotions, and, lighting, are, combined, with, a, medieval, formality, which, includes, gilt, backgrounds, the, universal, genius, leonardo, da, vinci, further, perfected, the, aspects, of, pictorial, art, lighting, linear, and, atmospheric, perspective, anatomy, foreshortening, and, characterisation, that, had, preoccupied, artists, of, the, early, renaissance, in, a, lifetime, of, studying, and, meticulously, recording, his, observations, of, the, natural, world, his, adoption, of, oil, paint, as, his, primary, media, meant, that, he, could, depict, light, and, its, effects, on, the, landscape, and, objects, more, naturally, and, with, greater, dramatic, effect, than, had, ever, been, done, before, as, demonstrated, in, the, mona, lisa, 1503, 1506, his, dissection, of, cadavers, carried, forward, the, understanding, of, skeletal, and, muscular, anatomy, as, seen, in, the, unfinished, saint, jerome, in, the, wilderness, c, 1480, his, depiction, of, human, emotion, in, the, last, supper, completed, 1495, 1498, set, the, benchmark, for, religious, painting, the, art, of, leonardo, s, younger, contemporary, michelangelo, took, a, very, different, direction, michelangelo, in, neither, his, painting, nor, his, sculpture, demonstrates, any, interest, in, the, observation, of, any, natural, object, except, the, human, body, he, perfected, his, technique, in, depicting, it, while, in, his, early, twenties, by, the, creation, of, the, enormous, marble, statue, of, david, and, the, group, piet, in, the, st, peter, s, basilica, rome, he, then, set, about, an, exploration, of, the, expressive, possibilities, of, the, human, anatomy, his, commission, by, pope, julius, ii, to, paint, the, sistine, chapel, ceiling, resulted, in, the, supreme, masterpiece, of, figurative, composition, which, was, to, have, profound, effect, on, every, subsequent, generation, of, european, artists, his, later, work, the, last, judgement, painted, on, the, altar, wall, of, the, sistine, chapel, between, 1534, and, 1541, shows, a, mannerist, also, called, late, renaissance, style, with, generally, elongated, bodies, which, took, over, from, the, high, renaissance, style, between, 1520, and, 1530, standing, alongside, leonardo, and, michelangelo, as, the, third, great, painter, of, the, high, renaissance, was, the, younger, raphael, who, in, a, short, lifespan, painted, a, great, number, of, lifelike, and, engaging, portraits, including, those, of, pope, julius, ii, and, his, successor, pope, leo, x, and, numerous, portrayals, of, the, madonna, and, christ, child, including, the, sistine, madonna, his, death, in, 1520, at, age, 37, is, considered, by, many, art, historians, to, be, the, end, of, the, high, renaissance, period, although, some, individual, artists, continued, working, in, the, high, renaissance, style, for, many, years, thereafter, in, northern, italy, the, high, renaissance, is, represented, primarily, by, members, of, the, venetian, school, especially, by, the, latter, works, of, giovanni, bellini, especially, religious, paintings, which, include, several, large, altarpieces, of, a, type, known, as, sacred, conversation, which, show, a, group, of, saints, around, the, enthroned, madonna, his, contemporary, giorgione, who, died, at, about, the, age, of, 32, in, 1510, left, a, small, number, of, enigmatic, works, including, the, tempest, the, subject, of, which, has, remained, a, matter, of, speculation, the, earliest, works, of, titian, date, from, the, era, of, the, high, renaissance, including, the, massive, altarpiece, the, assumption, of, the, virgin, which, combines, human, action, and, drama, with, spectacular, colour, and, atmosphere, titian, continued, painting, in, a, generally, high, renaissance, style, until, near, the, end, of, his, career, in, the, 1570s, although, he, increasingly, used, colour, and, light, over, line, to, define, his, figures, german, renaissance, art, falls, into, the, broader, category, of, the, renaissance, in, northern, europe, also, known, as, the, northern, renaissance, renaissance, influences, began, to, appear, in, german, art, in, the, 15th, century, but, this, trend, was, not, widespread, gardner, s, art, through, the, ages, identifies, michael, pacher, a, painter, and, sculptor, as, the, first, german, artist, whose, work, begins, to, show, italian, renaissance, influences, according, to, that, source, pacher, s, painting, st, wolfgang, forces, the, devil, to, hold, his, prayerbook, c, 1481, is, late, gothic, in, style, but, also, shows, the, influence, of, the, italian, artist, mantegna, in, the, 1500s, renaissance, art, in, germany, became, more, common, as, according, to, gardner, the, art, of, northern, europe, during, the, sixteenth, century, is, characterized, by, a, sudden, awareness, of, the, advances, made, by, the, italian, renaissance, and, by, a, desire, to, assimilate, this, new, style, as, rapidly, as, possible, one, of, the, best, known, practitioners, of, german, renaissance, art, was, albrecht, d, rer, 1471, 1528, whose, fascination, with, classical, ideas, led, him, to, italy, to, study, art, both, gardner, and, russell, recognized, the, importance, of, d, rer, s, contribution, to, german, art, in, bringing, italian, renaissance, styles, and, ideas, to, germany, russell, calls, this, opening, the, gothic, windows, of, german, art, while, gardner, calls, it, d, rer, s, life, mission, importantly, as, gardner, points, out, d, rer, was, the, first, northern, artist, who, fully, understood, the, basic, aims, of, the, southern, renaissance, although, his, style, did, not, always, reflect, that, the, same, source, says, that, hans, holbein, the, younger, 1497, 1543, successfully, assimilated, italian, ideas, while, also, keeping, northern, traditions, of, close, realism, this, is, contrasted, with, d, rer, s, tendency, to, work, in, his, own, native, german, style, instead, of, combining, german, and, italian, styles, other, important, artists, of, the, german, renaissance, were, matthias, gr, newald, albrecht, altdorfer, and, lucas, cranach, the, elder, artisans, such, as, engravers, became, more, concerned, with, aesthetics, rather, than, just, perfecting, their, crafts, germany, had, master, engravers, such, as, martin, schongauer, who, did, metal, engravings, in, the, late, 1400s, gardner, relates, this, mastery, of, the, graphic, arts, to, advances, in, printing, which, occurred, in, germany, and, says, that, metal, engraving, began, to, replace, the, woodcut, during, the, renaissance, however, some, artists, such, as, albrecht, d, rer, continued, to, do, woodcuts, both, gardner, and, russell, describe, the, fine, quality, of, d, rer, s, woodcuts, with, russell, stating, in, the, world, of, d, rer, that, d, rer, elevated, them, into, high, works, of, art, britain, was, very, late, to, develop, a, distinct, renaissance, style, and, most, artists, of, the, tudor, court, were, imported, foreigners, usually, from, the, low, countries, including, hans, holbein, the, younger, who, died, in, england, one, exception, was, the, portrait, miniature, which, artists, including, nicholas, hilliard, developed, into, a, distinct, genre, well, before, it, became, popular, in, the, rest, of, europe, renaissance, art, in, scotland, was, similarly, dependent, on, imported, artists, and, largely, restricted, to, the, court, renaissance, artists, painted, a, wide, variety, of, themes, religious, altarpieces, fresco, cycles, and, small, works, for, private, devotion, were, very, popular, for, inspiration, painters, in, both, italy, and, northern, europe, frequently, turned, to, jacobus, de, voragine, s, golden, legend, 1260, a, highly, influential, source, book, for, the, lives, of, saints, that, had, already, had, a, strong, influence, on, medieval, artists, the, rebirth, of, classical, antiquity, and, renaissance, humanism, also, resulted, in, many, mythological, and, history, paintings, ovidian, stories, for, example, were, very, popular, decorative, ornament, often, used, in, painted, architectural, elements, was, especially, influenced, by, classical, roman, motifs
