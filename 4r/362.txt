through, context, goodnight, irene, for, example, acquired, the, aura, of, a, protest, song, because, it, was, written, by, lead, belly, a, black, convict, and, social, outcast, although, on, its, face, it, is, a, love, song, or, they, may, be, abstract, expressing, in, more, general, terms, opposition, to, injustice, and, support, for, peace, or, free, thought, but, audiences, usually, know, what, is, being, referred, to, ludwig, van, beethoven, s, ode, to, joy, a, song, in, support, of, universal, brotherhood, is, a, song, of, this, kind, it, is, a, setting, of, a, poem, by, friedrich, schiller, celebrating, the, continuum, of, living, beings, who, are, united, in, their, capacity, for, feeling, pain, and, pleasure, and, hence, for, empathy, to, which, beethoven, himself, added, the, lines, that, all, men, are, brothers, songs, which, support, the, status, quo, do, not, qualify, as, protest, songs, protest, song, texts, may, have, significant, specific, content, the, labour, movement, musical, pins, and, needles, articulated, a, definition, of, a, protest, song, in, a, number, called, sing, me, a, song, of, social, significance, phil, ochs, once, explained, a, protest, song, is, a, song, that, s, so, specific, that, you, cannot, mistake, it, for, bs, some, researchers, have, argued, that, protest, songs, must, express, opposition, or, at, the, very, least, offer, some, alternative, solutions, if, they, are, limited, to, drawing, attention, to, social, issues, a, broad, definition, which, does, not, exclude, any, upcoming, form, of, creativity, defines, a, protest, song, as, one, performed, by, protesters, an, 18th, century, example, of, a, topical, song, intended, as, a, feminist, protest, song, is, rights, of, woman, 1795, sung, to, the, tune, of, god, save, the, king, written, anonymously, by, a, lady, and, published, in, the, philadelphia, minerva, october, 17, 1795, there, is, no, evidence, that, it, was, ever, sung, as, a, movement, song, however, the, sociologist, r, serge, denisoff, saw, protest, songs, rather, narrowly, in, terms, of, their, function, as, forms, of, persuasion, or, propaganda, denisoff, saw, the, protest, song, tradition, as, originating, in, the, psalms, or, songs, of, grassroots, protestant, religious, revival, movements, terming, these, hymns, protest, propaganda, as, well, denisoff, subdivided, protest, songs, as, either, magnetic, or, rhetorical, magnetic, protest, songs, were, aimed, at, attracting, people, to, the, movement, and, promoting, group, solidarity, and, commitment, for, example, keep, your, eyes, on, the, prize, and, we, shall, overcome, rhetorical, protest, songs, on, the, other, hand, are, often, characterized, by, individual, indignation, and, offer, a, straightforward, political, message, designed, to, change, political, opinion, denisoff, argued, that, although, rhetorical, songs, often, are, not, overtly, connected, to, building, a, larger, movement, they, should, nevertheless, be, considered, as, protest, propaganda, examples, include, bob, dylan, s, masters, of, war, which, contains, the, lines, i, hope, that, you, die, and, your, death, ll, come, soon, and, what, s, going, on, by, marvin, gaye, ron, eyerman, and, andrew, jamison, in, music, and, social, movements, mobilizing, tradition, in, the, twentieth, century, 1998, take, issue, with, what, they, consider, denisoff, s, reductive, approach, to, the, history, and, function, of, song, and, particularly, traditional, song, in, social, movements, they, point, out, that, denisoff, had, paid, little, attention, to, the, song, tunes, of, protest, music, considered, them, strictly, subordinate, to, the, texts, a, means, to, the, message, it, is, true, that, in, the, highly, text, oriented, western, european, song, tradition, tunes, can, be, subordinate, interchangeable, and, even, limited, in, number, as, in, portuguese, fado, which, only, has, 64, tunes, nevertheless, eyerman, and, jamison, point, out, that, some, of, the, most, effective, protest, songs, gain, power, through, their, appropriation, of, tunes, that, are, bearers, of, strong, cultural, traditions, they, also, note, that, there, is, more, to, music, and, movements, than, can, be, captured, within, a, functional, perspective, such, as, denisoff, s, which, focuses, on, the, use, made, of, music, within, already, existing, movements, music, and, song, we, suggest, can, maintain, a, movement, even, when, it, no, longer, has, a, visible, presence, in, the, form, of, organizations, leaders, and, demonstrations, and, can, be, a, vital, force, in, preparing, the, emergence, of, a, new, movement, here, the, role, and, place, of, music, needs, to, be, interpreted, through, a, broader, framework, in, which, tradition, and, ritual, are, understood, as, processes, of, identity, and, identification, as, encoded, and, embodied, forms, of, collective, meaning, and, memory, martin, luther, king, jr, described, the, freedom, songs, this, way, they, invigorate, the, movement, in, a, most, significant, way, these, freedom, songs, serve, to, give, unity, to, a, movement, ra, arabic, opinion, is, a, form, of, folk, music, originated, in, oran, algeria, from, bedouin, shepherds, mixed, with, spanish, french, african, and, arabic, musical, forms, its, origins, date, back, to, the, 1920s, and, has, been, primarily, evolved, by, the, women, referred, to, as, cheikhas, who, performed, in, cafes, bars, or, bordellos, often, for, men, a, typical, performance, included, the, cheikhas, accompanied, by, two, to, four, male, instrumentalists, playing, a, gasba, a, wooden, flute, and, gallal, a, metal, drum, rai, was, considered, a, rejection, of, the, traditional, algerian, music, of, the, time, and, the,

and, through, the, 1960s, male, musicians, began, performing, rai, music, and, incorporated, the, use, of, what, was, considered, to, be, modern, musical, instruments, of, that, time, such, as, the, violin, the, accordion, the, lute, and, the, trumpet, as, the, genre, evolved, over, time, it, continued, to, have, associations, with, political, movements, and, organizations, such, as, the, algerian, freedom, fighters, who, rallied, against, the, french, occupation, even, after, algeria, achieved, independence, in, 1962, rai, continued, to, have, an, adverse, relationship, with, the, algerian, government, which, exerted, a, tight, grip, upon, its, culture, in, fact, ra, had, been, banned, from, broadcast, media, though, it, thrived, in, underground, spaces, such, as, cabarets, it, was, forbidden, to, the, point, of, one, popular, singer, cheb, hasni, being, assassinated, however, since, the, government, lifted, its, restrictions, on, rai, in, the, 1980s, it, has, enjoyed, some, considerable, success, the, song, parisien, du, nord, by, cheb, mami, is, a, recent, example, of, how, the, genre, has, been, used, as, a, form, of, protest, as, the, song, was, written, as, a, protest, against, the, racial, tensions, that, sparked, the, 2005, french, riots, according, to, memi, it, is, a, song, against, racism, so, i, wanted, to, sing, it, with, a, north, african, who, was,

regime, s, censorship, they, include, some, mainstream, spanish, artists, of, the, era, as, joan, manuel, serrat, and, v, ctor, manuel, but, also, many, others, as, jos, antonio, labordeta, raimon, luis, eduardo, aute, rosa, le, n, or, llu, s, llach, the, catalan, language, then, a, non, official, language, in, the, country, was, often, used, as, a, vehicle, of, protest, in, itself, to, highlight, the, cultural, discrimination, towards, non, castilian, spanish, native, speakers, in, spain, most, of, the, protest, songs, were, in, a, folk, style, with, social, themes, and, were, popular, among, the, then, banned, left, wing, and, their, supporters, as, well, with, many, young, students, in, main, universities, some, notable, songs, were, al, alba, at, dawn, by, aute, al,

the, late, medieval, and, early, modern, period, reflect, the, social, upheavals, of, their, day, in, 1944, the, marxist, scholar, a, l, lloyd, claimed, that, the, cutty, wren, song, constituted, a, coded, anthem, against, feudal, oppression, and, actually, dated, back, to, the, english, peasants, revolt, of, 1381, making, it, the, oldest, extant, european, protest, song, he, offered, no, evidence, for, his, assertion, however, and, no, trace, of, the, song, has, been, found, before, the, 18th, century, despite, lloyd, s, dubious, claim, about, its, origins, however, the, cutty, wren, was, revived, and, used, as, a, protest, song, in, the, 1950s, folk, revival, an, example, of, what, may, be, considered, a, protest, song, in, contrast, the, rhyme, when, adam, delved, and, eve, span, who, was, then, the, gentleman, is, attested, as, authentically, originating, in, the, 1381, peasant, revolt, though, no, tune, associated, with, it, has, survived, ballads, celebrating, social, bandits, like, robin, hood, from, the, 14th, century, onwards, can, be, seen, as, expressions, of, a, desire, for, social, justice, though, although, social, criticism, is, implied, and, there, is, no, overt, questioning, of, the, status, quo, the, era, of, civil, and, religious, wars, of, the, 17th, century, in, britain, gave, rise, to, the, radical, communistic, millenarian, levellers, and, diggers, movements, and, their, associated, ballads, and, hymns, as, for, example, the, diggers, song, with, the, incendiary, verse, but, the, gentry, must, come, down, and, the, poor, shall, wear, the, crown, stand, up, now, diggers, all, the, digger, movement, was, violently, crushed, and, so, it, is, not, surprising, if, few, overt, protest, songs, associated, with, it, have, survived, from, roughly, the, same, period, however, songs, protesting, wars, and, the, human, suffering, they, inflict, abound, though, such, songs, do, not, generally, explicitly, condemn, the, wars, or, the, leaders, who, wage, them, for, example, the, maunding, souldier, or, the, fruits, of, warre, is, beggery, framed, as, a, begging, appeal, from, a, crippled, soldier, of, the, thirty, years, war, such, songs, have, been, known, strictly, speaking, as, songs, of, complaint, rather, than, of, protest, since, they, offered, no, solution, or, hint, of, rebellion, against, the, status, quo, the, advent, of, industrialization, in, the, 18th, and, early, 19th, centuries, was, accompanied, by, a, series, of, protest, movements, and, a, corresponding, increase, in, the, number, of, topical, social, protest, songs, and, ballads, an, important, example, is, the, triumph, of, general, ludd, which, built, a, fictional, persona, for, the, alleged, leader, of, the, early, 19th, century, anti, technological, luddite, movement, in, the, cloth, industry, of, the, north, midlands, and, which, made, explicit, reference, to, the, robin, hood, tradition, a, surprising, english, folk, hero, immortalized, in, song, is, napoleon, bonaparte, the, military, figure, most, often, the, subject, of, popular, ballads, many, of, them, treating, him, as, the, champion, of, the, common, working, man, in, songs, such, as, the, bonny, bunch, of, roses, and, napoleon, s, dream, as, labour, became, more, organized, songs, were, used, as, anthems, and, propaganda, for, miners, with, songs, such, as, the, black, leg, miner, and, for, factory, workers, with, songs, such, as, the, factory, bell, these, industrial, protest, songs, were, largely, ignored, during, the, first, english, folk, revival, of, the, later, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, which, had, focused, on, songs, that, had, been, collected, in, rural, areas, where, they, were, still, being, sung, and, on, music, education, they, were, revived, in, the, 1960s, and, performed, by, figures, such, as, a, l, lloyd, on, his, album, the, iron, muse, 1963, in, the, 1980s, the, anarchist, rock, band, chumbawamba, recorded, several, versions, of, traditional, english, protest, songs, as, english, rebel, songs, 1381, 1914, colin, irwin, a, journalist, for, the, guardian, believes, the, modern, british, protest,
