musicology, from, greek, mousik, music, and, logia, domain, of, study, is, the, scholarly, study, of, music, musicology, research, combines, and, intersects, with, many, fields, including, psychology, sociology, acoustics, neurology, natural, sciences, formal, sciences, and, computer, science, musicology, is, traditionally, divided, into, three, branches, music, history, systematic, musicology, and, ethnomusicology, historical, musicologists, study, the, history, of, musical, traditions, the, origins, of, works, and, the, biographies, of, composers, ethnomusicologists, draw, from, anthropology, particularly, field, research, to, understand, how, and, why, people, make, music, systematic, musicology, includes, music, theory, aesthetics, pedagogy, musical, acoustics, the, science, and, technology, of, musical, instruments, and, the, musical, implications, of, physiology, psychology, sociology, philosophy, and, computing, cognitive, musicology, is, the, set, of, phenomena, surrounding, the, cognitive, modeling, of, music, when, musicologists, carry, out, research, using, computers, their, research, often, falls, under, the, field, of, computational, musicology, music, therapy, is, a, specialized, form, of, applied, musicology, which, is, sometimes, considered, more, closely, affiliated, with, health, fields, and, other, times, regarded, as, part, of, musicology, proper, the, 19th, century, philosophical, trends, that, led, to, the, re, establishment, of, formal, musicology, education, in, german, and, austrian, universities, had, combined, methods, of, systematization, with, evolution, these, models, were, established, not, only, in, the, field, of, physical, anthropology, but, also, cultural, anthropology, this, was, influenced, by, hegel, s, ideas, on, ordering, phenomena, from, the, simple, to, complex, as, the, stages, of, evolution, are, classified, from, primitive, to, developed, and, stages, of, history, from, ancient, to, modern, comparative, methods, became, more, widespread, in, musicology, beginning, around, 1880, the, parent, disciplines, of, musicology, include, musicology, also, has, two, central, practically, oriented, sub, disciplines, with, no, parent, discipline, performance, practice, and, research, and, the, theory, analysis, and, composition, of, music, the, disciplinary, neighbors, of, musicology, address, other, forms, of, art, performance, ritual, and, communication, including, the, history, and, theory, of, the, visual, and, plastic, arts, and, architecture, linguistics, literature, and, theater, religion, and, theology, and, sport, musical, knowledge, is, applied, within, medicine, education, and, music, therapy, which, effectively, are, parent, disciplines, of, applied, musicology, music, history, or, historical, musicology, is, concerned, with, the, composition, performance, reception, and, criticism, of, music, over, time, historical, studies, of, music, are, for, example, concerned, with, a, composer, s, life, and, works, the, developments, of, styles, and, genres, such, as, baroque, concertos, the, social, function, of, music, for, a, particular, group, of, people, such, as, court, music, or, modes, of, performance, at, a, particular, place, and, time, such, as, johann, sebastian, bach, s, choir, in, leipzig, like, the, comparable, field, of, art, history, different, branches, and, schools, of, historical, musicology, emphasize, different, types, of, musical, works, and, approaches, to, music, there, are, also, national, differences, in, various, definitions, of, historical, musicology, in, theory, music, history, could, refer, to, the, study, of, the, history, of, any, type, or, genre, of, music, such, as, the, music, of, india, or, rock, music, in, practice, these, research, topics, are, more, often, considered, within, ethnomusicology, and, historical, musicology, is, typically, assumed, to, imply, western, art, music, of, the, european, tradition, the, methods, of, historical, musicology, include, source, studies, especially, manuscript, studies, palaeography, philology, especially, textual, criticism, style, criticism, historiography, the, choice, of, historical, method, musical, analysis, analysis, of, music, to, find, inner, coherence, and, iconography, the, application, of, musical, analysis, to, further, these, goals, is, often, a, part, of, music, history, though, pure, analysis, or, the, development, of, new, tools, of, music, analysis, is, more, likely, to, be, seen, in, the, field, of, music, theory, music, historians, create, a, number, of, written, products, ranging, from, journal, articles, describing, their, current, research, new, editions, of, musical, works, biographies, of, composers, and, other, musicians, book, length, studies, or, university, textbook, chapters, or, entire, textbooks, music, historians, may, examine, issues, in, a, close, focus, as, in, the, case, of, scholars, who, examine, the, relationship, between, words, and, music, for, a, given, composer, s, art, songs, on, the, other, hand, some, scholars, take, a, broader, view, and, assess, the, place, of, a, given, type, of, music, such, as, the, symphony, in, society, using, techniques, drawn, from, other, fields, such, as, economics, sociology, or, philosophy, new, musicology, is, a, term, applied, since, the, late, 1980s, to, a, wide, body, of, work, emphasizing, cultural, study, analysis, and, criticism, of, music, such, work, may, be, based, on, feminist, gender, studies, queer, theory, or, postcolonial, theory, or, the, work, of, theodor, w, adorno, although, new, musicology, emerged, from, within, historical, musicology, the, emphasis, on, cultural, study, within, the, western, art, music, tradition, places, new, musicology, at, the, junction, between, historical, ethnological, and, sociological, research, in, music, new, musicology, was, a, reaction, against, traditional, historical, musicology, which, according, to, susan, mcclary, fastidiously, declares, issues, of, musical, signification, off, limits, to, those, engaged, in, legitimate, scholarship, charles, rosen, however, retorts, that, mcclary, sets, up, like, so, many, of, the, new, musicologists, a, straw, man, to, knock, down, the, dogma, that, music, has, no, meaning, and, no, political, or, social, significance, today, many, musicologists, no, longer, distinguish, between, musicology, and, new, musicology, since, it, has, been, recognized, that, many, of, the, scholarly, concerns, once, associated, with, new, musicology, already, were, mainstream, in, musicology, so, that, the, term, new, no, longer, applies, ethnomusicology, formerly, comparative, musicology, is, the, study, of, music, in, its, cultural, context, it, is, often, considered, the, anthropology, or, ethnography, of, music, jeff, todd, titon, has, called, it, the, study, of, people, making, music, although, it, is, most, often, concerned, with, the, study, of, non, western, music, it, also, includes, the, study, of, western, music, from, an, anthropological, or, sociological, perspective, cultural, studies, and, sociology, as, well, as, other, disciplines, in, the, social, sciences, and, humanities, some, ethnomusicologists, primarily, conduct, historical, studies, but, the, majority, are, involved, in, long, term, participant, observation, or, combine, ethnographic, musicological, and, historical, approaches, in, their, fieldwork, therefore, ethnomusicological, scholarship, can, be, characterized, as, featuring, a, substantial, intensive, fieldwork, component, often, involving, long, term, residence, within, the, community, studied, closely, related, to, ethnomusicology, is, the, emerging, branch, of, sociomusicology, for, instance, ko, 2011, proposed, the, hypothesis, of, biliterate, and, trimusical, in, hong, kong, sociomusicology, popular, music, studies, known, misleadingly, as, popular, musicology, emerged, in, the, 1980s, as, an, increasing, number, of, musicologists, ethnomusicologists, and, other, varieties, of, historians, of, american, and, european, culture, began, to, write, about, popular, music, past, and, present, the, first, journal, focusing, on, popular, music, studies, was, popular, music, which, began, publication, in, 1981, the, same, year, an, academic, society, solely, devoted, to, the, topic, was, formed, the, international, association, for, the, study, of, popular, music, the, association, s, founding, was, partly, motivated, by, the, interdisciplinary, agenda, of, popular, musicology, though, the, group, has, been, characterized, by, a, polarized, musicological, and, sociological, approach, also, typical, of, popular, musicology, music, theory, is, a, field, of, study, that, describes, the, elements, of, music, and, includes, the, development, and, application, of, methods, for, composing, and, for, analyzing, music, through, both, notation, and, on, occasion, musical, sound, itself, broadly, theory, may, include, any, statement, belief, or, conception, of, or, about, music, boretz, 1995, a, person, who, studies, or, practices, music, theory, is, a, music, theorist, some, music, theorists, attempt, to, explain, the, techniques, composers, use, by, establishing, rules, and, patterns, others, model, the, experience, of, listening, to, or, performing, music, though, extremely, diverse, in, their, interests, and, commitments, many, western, music, theorists, are, united, in, their, belief, that, the, acts, of, composing, performing, and, listening, to, music, may, be, explicated, to, a, high, degree, of, detail, this, as, opposed, to, a, conception, of, musical, expression, as, fundamentally, ineffable, except, in, musical, sounds, generally, works, of, music, theory, are, both, descriptive, and, prescriptive, attempting, both, to, define, practice, and, to, influence, later, practice, musicians, study, music, theory, to, understand, the, structural, relationships, in, the, nearly, always, notated, music, composers, study, music, theory, to, understand, how, to, produce, effects, and, structure, their, own, works, composers, may, study, music, theory, to, guide, their, precompositional, and, compositional, decisions, broadly, speaking, music, theory, in, the, western, tradition, focuses, on, harmony, and, counterpoint, and, then, uses, these, to, explain, large, scale, structure, and, the, creation, of, melody, music, psychology, applies, the, content, and, methods, of, psychology, to, understand, how, music, is, created, perceived, responded, to, and, incorporated, into, individuals, and, societies, daily, lives, its, primary, branches, include, cognitive, musicology, which, emphasizes, the, use, of, computational, models, for, human, musical, abilities, and, cognition, and, the, cognitive, neuroscience, of, music, which, studies, the, way, that, music, perception, and, production, manifests, in, the, brain, using, the, methodologies, of, cognitive, neuroscience, while, aspects, of, the, field, can, be, highly, theoretical, much, of, modern, music, psychology, seeks, to, optimize, the, practices, and, professions, of, music, performance, composition, education, and, therapy, performance, practice, draws, on, many, of, the, tools, of, historical, musicology, to, answer, the, specific, question, of, how, music, was, performed, in, various, places, at, various, times, in, the, past, although, previously, confined, to, early, music, recent, research, in, performance, practice, has, embraced, questions, such, as, how, the, early, history, of, recording, affected, the, use, of, vibrato, in, classical, music, or, instruments, in, klezmer, within, the, rubric, of, musicology, performance, practice, tends, to, emphasize, the, collection, and, synthesis, of, evidence, about, how, music, should, be, performed, the, important, other, side, learning, how, to, sing, authentically, or, perform, a, historical, instrument, is, usually, part, of, conservatory, or, other, performance, training, however, many, top, researchers, in, performance, practice, are, also, excellent, musicians, music, performance, research, or, music, performance, science, is, strongly, associated, with, music, psychology, it, aims, to, document, and, explain, the, psychological, physiological, sociological, and, cultural, details, of, how, music, is, actually, performed, rather, than, how, it, should, be, performed, the, approach, to, research, tends, to, be, systematic, and, empirical, and, to, involve, the, collection, and, analysis, of, both, quantitative, and, qualitative, data, the, findings, of, music, performance, research, can, often, be, applied, in, music, education, musicologists, in, tenure, track, professor, positions, typically, hold, a, phd, in, musicology, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, some, musicologists, obtained, professor, positions, with, an, ma, as, their, highest, degree, but, in, the, 2010s, the, phd, is, the, standard, minimum, credential, for, tenure, track, professor, positions, as, part, of, their, initial, training, musicologists, typically, complete, a, bmus, or, a, ba, in, music, or, a, related, field, such, as, history, and, in, many, cases, an, ma, in, musicology, some, individuals, apply, directly, from, a, bachelor, s, degree, to, a, phd, and, in, these, cases, they, may, not, receive, an, ma, in, the, 2010s, given, the, increasingly, interdisciplinary, nature, of, university, graduate, programs, some, applicants, for, musicology, phd, programs, may, have, academic, training, both, in, music, and, outside, of, music, e, g, a, student, may, apply, with, a, bmus, and, an, ma, in, psychology, in, music, education, individuals, may, hold, an, m, ed, and, an, ed, d, most, musicologists, work, as, instructors, lecturers, or, professors, in, colleges, universities, or, conservatories, the, job, market, for, tenure, track, professor, positions, is, very, competitive, entry, level, applicants, must, hold, a, completed, phd, or, the, equivalent, degree, and, applicants, to, more, senior, professor, positions, must, have, a, strong, record, of, publishing, in, peer, reviewed, journals, some, phd, holding, musicologists, are, only, able, to, find, insecure, positions, as, sessional, lecturers, the, job, tasks, of, a, musicologist, are, the, same, as, those, of, a, professor, in, any, other, humanities, discipline, teaching, undergraduate, and, or, graduate, classes, in, their, area, of, specialization, and, in, many, cases, some, general, courses, such, as, music, appreciation, or, introduction, to, music, history, conducting, research, in, their, area, of, expertise, publishing, articles, about, their, research, in, peer, reviewed, journals, authors, book, chapters, books, or, textbooks, traveling, to, conferences, to, give, talks, on, their, research, and, learn, about, research, in, their, field, and, if, their, program, includes, a, graduate, school, supervising, ma, and, phd, students, giving, them, guidance, on, the, preparation, of, their, theses, and, dissertations, some, musicology, professors, may, take, on, senior, administrative, positions, in, their, institution, such, as, dean, or, chair, of, the, school, of, music, the, vast, majority, of, major, musicologists, and, music, historians, from, past, generations, have, been, men, as, in, the, 19th, century, and, early, 20th, century, women, s, involvement, in, teaching, music, was, mainly, in, elementary, and, secondary, music, teaching, nevertheless, some, women, musicologists, have, reached, the, top, ranks, of, the, profession, carolyn, abbate, born, 1956, is, an, american, musicologist, who, did, her, phd, at, princeton, university, she, has, been, described, by, the, harvard, gazette, as, one, of, the, world, s, most, accomplished, and, admired, music, historians, susan, mcclary, born, 1946, is, a, musicologist, associated, with, new, musicology, who, incorporates, feminist, music, criticism, in, her, work, mcclary, holds, a, phd, from, harvard, university, one, of, her, best, known, works, is, feminine, endings, 1991, which, covers, musical, constructions, of, gender, and, sexuality, gendered, aspects, of, traditional, music, theory, gendered, sexuality, in, musical, narrative, music, as, a, gendered, discourse, and, issues, affecting, women, musicians, other, notable, women, scholars, include, a, list, of, open, access, european, journals,
